You know , Jimmy ? Something about a spine snapping ... Never gets old . - It sounds like ... - The end , the beginning . Or all the same ? Have a seat , Henry . When a man is first crippled , there 's always one question on everyone 's mind , ... especially in his . Does his dick works ? Mine didn 't , so I plotted my escape from this chair . I come to Russia when the West banned resuscitation of the dead tissue . Akan is a mega-maniac , but my research was funded . I kept my eyes on the Nobel Prize . Who has time for itheatrics when he 's rich and his cock works , eh ? I paid a high price . I stopped making soldiers and then I succeeded . A breed of men made of cyber-flesh . Mainly , they 're just fancy-pants prostheses But don 't dare tell ... My avatars ! Now , cyborgs on the other hand have bits and a brain . They think for themselves , in theory , at least . Do you have a look at you ? That hippie , always with the ganja . - NEW DEVICE CONNECTED - You 're not baked , are you ? I hope not . Alright . You are the man , Henry . There are very little actual man left , of course . Enhanced skeletal muscular systems , cardiovascular turbo boosted with a * * * 244 atomic battery . A good night 's sleep and you 'd power an aircraft carrier . Remarkable technology , is it not ? - Initializing ... - Not you . My boys . I made the first few for revenge . But then I started exploring new aspects of myself . Can I have a sip ? I have lived these past years , Henry . My lads , they get speeding tickets , they walk barefoot through the grass . And , boy , do they get laid ! You never guess what we do here sometimes , alone . Hit " play " , over there . Play . BROADCAST IN PROGRESS What are you doing ? BROADCAST IN PROGRESS Close your eyes . Close your eyes . Something is wrong with you , mate . Don 't worry , it 's not like the clap or anything . Just gotta sit you down in this chair and take a look at you , yeah ? The scan says you 're in terrible danger . Of being shit , for being a traitor , ya lying grasser ! I 'll shut you down , mate . Put down the Proto-Baby . Now ! I tried to unplug you nicely , Even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan . No ? What 's this ? What 's that ? You 're broadcasting it to Akan ! Enough ! Enough . Even if I did believe you , you still have to ... Henry , no ! No ! You brought them into my lab ! I trusted you ! Henry , Henry , please , kill me . Akan won 't . You made me live in this straitjacket of rotten and smelly skin ! What the fuck was I thinking ? That Akan 's toy robot was my friend ! Thank you , Henry . Fuck you too , but mostly thanks . My lab 's compromised , But I can build a new one using Akan 's equipment when we go and get your wife . Together . Alright ? Hey , put that on the wall . If I can 't have my lab no one 's having it . Now , don 't lose this . Fuck you , Akan . Don 't change the channel . We are coming right over . Right , I counted six vehicles . That 's at least 35 men . We 've got to cut them down to half before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting change and get out alive . Also , there 's a certain stigma attached to blokes who likes musicals . I just want to get out of there right now as straight as an arrow . Got it ? Here they come . Wait for it . Wait for it . Now . Alright , cover me . Yes ! Fuck ! They are in the hotel . We don 't need the sniper anymore either . Go inside , see the Colonel . Over here , laddie ! Arm yourself to the teeth . Don 't touch that . Emma Gee is mine . As my father used to say " A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay . " Come on . Chop-chop ! The Big Sally . Well , home is where the battle is . Alright , private , it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to equipment , understood ? Come along . You can hear them , but you can 't shoot them . You can drop a grenade , then . Drop an egg down there , laddie . Forward ! Come on . My Lord , how embarrassing . Dodged a bullet on that one . I 'll cover you ! Move around them ! Don 't let the cripple get below you , laddie ! There we go . Wait ! Help me with the cripple ! Better take five paces backward on your mark , laddie . A crippled home for crippled man . Thank you , Yuri . My quarters are actually up there . Would you like to see them ? We will . Indeed . Don 't scare the horsie . Take the next exit . Over there , that 's right . Turn off the engine , laddie . Let 's turn the tables on these ballocks . Tallyho . Big Ben . Akan is a cunt ! Oh my ! Looks like Akan has already begun . By tomorrow these poor chaps will be super robotic soldiers like yourself . Look out ! What 's red and bad for your teeth ? On your feet , lad . On your left . I 'm gonna buy you some time ! Seal the door ! I can 't tell you the number of times I 've dreamt that I was riding up this lift . It 's a pity that I can 't - It 's just a landing gear , laddie . Now , listen to me . When you kill Akan , I want you to look at him right in those eyes until the rest of him is just as dead as them , understood ? No , I 'm afraid I will not be coming with you . But you 've letting me getting through this far , has given an old sweat his grandest gift in all his years . No . It 's locked at its jugular . If you uncorked it , I won 't be able to ... The - the thing in your pocket quickly . I 'm afraid I have a confession to make . You see , I 've been surveilling Akan for years . So when you dropped down onto that road there and went rogue so magnificently , and all I saw was my chance of revenge . You proved me your attitude with Dimitry , but then in the forest ... Well , I noticed an implant . A memory block , see ? And I couldn 't afford to have you remember a better life somewhere else , so ... I left it in . Not my finest hour , I 'm afraid . But then , back in my lab , while I was trying to analyze what you could do for me . I realized ... Who you are to me , Henry . It 's bloody nice , having a friend , Henry . Me think all those deaths would 've prepared me for this . If you haven 't been ready , you 'll start to remember bits of your past , Henry . And those memories are real . They 're you . Trust them . Memories , memories , memories . My first batch of cyber-soldiers . With everything that you have experienced today uploaded into what 's left of their brains . All they remember is waking up in the lab ... And their wife screwing their legs on . I love you Charlie . I love you , Edward . I love you , Thomas . Do you recognize this ? No ? That 's odd . They 're your wife 's . I smell what you like about her . This one is almost ready for you . But I warn you , their boosters make one to you have now ... Look like a fucking night wolf . Go ahead and fuck him up . Get up . Get up ! ADRENALINE Can you handle this ? Henry . Why are you hitting yourself , Henry ? Baby ? Baby , are you okay ? I love how protective you are of me . You owe me an apology . Sure ? For doubting me . I did had certain apprehensions . Why did you let me do it ? I was just detaining my women and losing all of my men . Is everybody dead ? - Yes - Yes . Do you know when I realize that this was working ? When ? When Henry pulled me to the escape pod , trying to get me out of the lab , no matter what . Who would have thought that pussy is a great motivator ? We will have a hundred of you tomorrow , a thousand next week . Each one 's first memory will be his wife Slipping a cheap brass ring in his finger . Every single one of my soldiers , Will awake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells them , Whether it 's marching in Paris or the White House lawn . I would like to pretend you 'd understand the part you 've played . You didn 't make history , Henry . You helped end it . You ... little ... pussy . It 's what my old man called me . It 's like it was my name . And I proved them right by killing all the wrong people . I love you , Henry . And I 'll never call you anything but your name , but you gotta decide . Are you gonna lay there and swallow that blood in your mouth ? Or are you gonna stand up , spit it out , and go spill theirs ? Akan ! No , fuck - No ! Stop ! I order you to stop ! Henry ! Stop ! Where it he ? No . Fuck you , motherfucker ! Fuck you How could you do this to me , Henry ? How could you fucking do this ? Answer me ! Answer me ! EZ Motherfucker ! What happened , Henry ? You were supposed to love me . Henry ! Henry ! Listen to your heart !

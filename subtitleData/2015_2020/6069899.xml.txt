 May I ask a question ? Queen to F3 . Shoot . King to G7 . Is it a good idea to send me into battle ? Rook to E4 . If I die , the Deucalion 's Aldnoah will shut down . I 'm aware of that . Rook to D8 . But we 'll worry about that when we have to . Do you want to be removed from the front lines , Ensign Kaizuka ? No . I 'll go into battle . Queen to F6 , check . King to F6 , king takes queen . We 're in agreement , then . Bishop to E5 , check . I 'll put it on the monitor . Did you come up with that move yourself ? Or is it something that analytical engine of yours cooked up ? It 's mine , about 70-30 . About 70-30 ? I 'm assigning tasks to unused brain cells to try to optimize its processing . So it 's both the device 's suggestion and my own idea at the same time . This ship and her crew both owe you our lives . If you want to fight , I think we should support that . I don 't deserve any special treatment . Did you hear that Aldnoah activation tests were conducted using blood samples that had been drawn from the princess ? King to G5 . Result , failure . Blood alone was not sufficient for Aldnoah activation . So you could be considered a special case indeed , Ensign . When you resuscitated the princess , the activation factor transferred to ... no , infected you . Then it was fully activated when you came into contact with royal blood . Over the past ten months or so , we 've obtained plenty of intel on Aldnoah and their Kataphrakts . But they still have the overwhelming edge in military strength . There 's no guarantee that we 'll win if we keep on fighting . But if we do , Ensign Kaizuka ... I 'll put my money on you . Bishop to G7 . Do you resign ? Was that move yours ? Or your left eye 's ? I 'll leave that to your imagination . I suppose not even the Tharsis can see that far into the future . See to it . Yes , sir . Welcome back , Milord Slaine . I clustered my shots in the region that you calculated , Mr. Harklight . Let us pray that they won 't be influenced by some unexpected wind . Ah , I thought I smelled something . A dog has snuck aboard . A rather grubby one , at that . What are you doing here ? Good day , Count Barouhcruz . Count Marylcian . I rushed here so that I might join in the battle as well . Terran dog ... Mind your tongue ! Count Saazbaum ! Slaine Troyard here is my vassal . If he has given some offense , I offer my apologies . However , if this treatment is unwarranted , Count Marylcian , it will not go well for you . If this Terran were merely your pet , it would be eccentric , but tolerable . But to appoint him a knight ? Is that not taking your game too far ? Count Barouhcruz , it is not your place to offer opinions regarding my vassals . Perhaps , but him fighting alongside us is another matter entirely ! One cannot take to the field of battle with someone who might turn traitor at any moment ! If that is your concern , please strike me down right here . You are entirely correct . If I go into battle with you , it might very well be me who is attacked from behind . How dare you ! Men ! Hear me , all of you ! By the grace of the emperor of Vers , I name Slaine Troyard my son right here and now . All of you here are my witnesses ! Milord Count ... Stand , Slaine . From this day forth , you are my son . Will you raise a hand to him even now , Count Marylcian ? If you are prepared to go to such lengths , so be it . But if his behavior is the least bit suspicious , I will put him down without mercy . Forgive me . I have put you in an awkward position . It is fine . I had decided to do this long ago . I , too , take to the field of battle . I must have a successor just in case . From now on , think of me as your father . Congratulations , Milord Slaine ! The count 's heir ... This puts you one step closer to your dream . That 's enough , Mr. Harklight . I don 't have any dreams . It 's almost time . Yes ... Who do you think will win , Eddelrittuo ? Th-The glorious Vers Imperial Forces will emerge victorious , of course ! Oh ? Doesn 't that trouble you ? You have friends aboard a United Earth Forces ship , don 't you ? Perish the thought ! Friends on Earth ? Of course . Let 's have a wager , then . A wager ? If the Vers Empire wins , I bet ... Let me think ... My sister 's life , perhaps ? I 'm joking . What are you dreaming of right now , sister ? Have you seen Inko ? The electromagnetic catapult , I think ? She 's probably with Rayet . Thanks . Don 't get lost . I 'll try . Sweats ? ! You 're too greedy , Yutaro-chan . Tharsis . Details of its abilities , unknown . High rate of attack evasion reported . Confirmed pilot ... Slaine Troyard . A good luck charm given to me by a dear Terran friend when we arrived on Earth . Animals that fly through the air ... It is just as you said , Slaine ! Is he equipped with a neuro-linked analytical engine too ? Indeed . But I don 't have enough data . It dodged my attacks as though it could see the future . If that 's true ... it could be a problem . You monologuing ? I was talking to myself . That 's what monologuing means . The warrior god Odin , rider of the mythological , eight-legged Sleipnir , drank of the waters of Mímisbrunnr and was granted vast wisdom . But the price he paid for that wisdom was his left eye . Norse mythology . Know-it-all . Don 't make fun of me ! After the battle in Russia , I wanted off the ship . I was terrified . But then it hit me that if I did , I 'd never be able to look Okojo in the eye when I do die . If your steed is ever acting up , come see me day or night . I 'll fix it up in a flash . I 'll hold you to that . Okay , why don 't we grab a bite before the battle ? There 's still some time . I 'll pass . When I was shot , my stomach was empty , apparently . They say I would 've died if my organs had been contaminated by stomach contents . Oh . Sure . But I might not get another chance , so maybe some tea . What are his reel selections ? He 's got a ♪ 1 through ♪ 3 , a ♪ 10 for emergencies , and one on the left and right . It 's specced out for high-G pivots . Long , thin wires aren 't cut out for that . Found you ! Hey , it 's Team Deucalion . So you 're the Aldnoah unit that everybody 's talking about , huh ? I hear one of you is a Martian . Don 't get in our way on the battlefield , little ladies . What was their problem ? Bunch of jerks ! They 're not wrong , though . All Martians are the enemy . I know that better than anyone . You 're so adorable , Rayet . You 've got the " tsun " part down pat . Huh ? I wish you 'd show a little more " dere , " though . What are you talking about ? Want some candy ? I 'm gonna deck you . We will enter defense airspace in 30 minutes . Please launch . Good hunting ! Is my steed ready ? The fine-tuning has been completed ! Good ! Dioscuria II , launching ! Slaine Troyard , launching in the Tharsis . Stygis Squadron , launching ! Martian Kataphrakt squadron approaching ! Calling all forces ! Commence operation ! Message from HQ ! Commence operation !

They can 't hit us in this wind , anyway ! Hit them when they get in close ! Hit them when they get in close ... Hit them when they get in close ... My umbrella 's been hit ! Mustang 11 ! I 'm fine , but the debris is not ! I can 't get a clear shot with all this shaking ! Mustang 00 , moving to assist . Inaho ! Hey , what about your umbrella ? ! It 's just a drizzle . I don 't need it . Stop pulling crazy stunts , darn it ! I wouldn 't be able to use it in a dogfight anyway . Inferring gravitational shifts . Data compensation , ready . Fire . Commence attack ! Why you ! Pivoting via wire swing-by . Returning to combat airspace . ♪ 3 , shoot . Pivot complete in 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ... Release . Inaho Kaizuka ... Slaine Troyard ... Marineros Base will make next approach in 30 seconds ! Main guns ready to fire . Attention , all platoons ! Get clear of our line of fire ! Rayet ! This is Rhinelander 22 !

That 's some accurate shooting . I knew it , he 's using predictions , too . ♪ 1 , pivot . I 'll wait until the instant he comes out of the rocks . He 'll attack the instant I come out from the rocks . Coordinates confirmed . Two minutes to impact . Let 's do this . Fire . I hit him ? That 's - . Are you all right , Slaine ? Fall back . No , I can still fight ! Don 't overdo it . The orange Kataphrakt ... I owe him some payback ! Looking for the gap in my barrier ? I took the liberty of changing its location . Fly , my servants ! Energy joints , linked . Blade field , engaged . Sword drawn . There 's no escape . Inaho ! I 'll cover you ! Get away , Inaho ! Stay back , Inko ! No ! Stay there ! Right at that position ! Prepare to meet your maker , Terran ! Right kick thruster jettisoned . Fire ! The flames aren 't being sucked in ! The barrier gap ! You won 't get away ! Slaine ! What 's that ? A high-speed debris cluster . I picked up a debris cloud closing in at high speed on my 3D Doppler radar . Thanks , Inko . A split second later , and I 'd have been caught in it , too . Impossible ! My Dioscuria , brought low by mere debris ? ! That wasn 't debris . It was bullets . I fired them off before the battle began . They were aimed so that they would swing around the Earth and land at that spot right now . Slaine ? I had originally meant it as a trap to defeat Inaho Kaizuka . The trick was to disable your dimensional barrier , but I thought that if anyone could manage it , it was him . Slaine ... Shut up ! Did you honestly believe that I would swear fealty to you ? To the man who pulled the trigger against Princess Asseylum ? ! Did you think I would forgive you ? ! My second volley will arrive soon . Goodbye ... Father . Not too shabby . On this day , I have lost my second father . He was also a great man who devoted his life to the prosperity of the Vers Empire . I hereby announce my resolve to carry on both my fathers ' legacy and fight for the even greater prosperity of the Vers Empire . Lords of the Vers Orbital Knights . This is no time to be squabbling amongst each other . As knights of the noble Vers Empire , should we not work hand in hand to eradicate Earth 's resistance forces ? In the name of Her Imperial Highness Asseylum Vers Allusia ! Let us punish the Terrans who dare defy the Vers Empire ! He isn 't lying ... Her Highness Asseylum is biding her time at our lunar base ! - I knew it ... She 's alive . - In hopes that she may remain - Milord , you must be exhausted . Mr. Harklight , you were born into the third class , weren 't you ? I was . Though they were poor and of a low class , my father and mother worked hard to raise me and used every means at their disposal so that I could serve the Orbital Knights . Milord Slaine , it is for that reason that I have the utmost respect for you . You , who have attained the rank of count even though you are a Terran . This new era will be for people like us . Let 's begin , Harklight . Yes ... Count Slaine Saazbaum Troyard . Pivoting Trap

 ARION : No Elf has ever travelled beyond the Breakline . - No army , you won 't survive . - Which is why I need a guide . - Slanter . - ( GROWLS ) Proposition . Your help in exchange for your freedom . - You must be desperate . - Dagda Mor has returned . The quest is more important than any one life ! Can 't let your emotions get in the way . EVENTINE : The Ellcrys seed must be carried to a place called Safehold . She 's not gonna help if she 's dragged along like a prisoner . You don 't want her hands free for some other reason ? - ( YELLING AND GROWLING ) - Fire those Stones up , kid ! - They 're not working . - Time for plan B. ( ROARING ) ( LAUGHS ) Told you I had a plan . - I deserve the crown . - No-one deserves the crown . Ugh ! Then I 'll just have to take it . Long live the King . ( GASPS ) Shh . Come on . Where are you taking me ? It 's a surprise . I 've had enough surprises for one lifetime . Wil ! Wil ? Damn you . ( LAUGHS ) It still works . ( SQUEAKING ) Climb on . SONG : ♪ She sold her heart for armour ♪ And now she 's rusting out ♪ She waits there in the garden ... ♪ WIL : You see ? It 's fun , right ? ( AMBERLE LAUGHS ) ( WIL LAUGHS ) WIL : I do have feelings for you . And you thought you 'd show me by sleeping with Eretria ? ( BOTH LAUGH ) Only because I couldn 't have what I really wanted . ♪ It 's so ♪ Real ♪ It 's so ... ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) ♪ It 's so ♪ Real ♪ This love is gone ... ♪ ( DEEP VOICE ) Amberle ... ( LAUGHS MANIACALLY ) ( DRAMATIC MUSIC ) SONG : ♪ I feel it running through my veins ♪ And I need that fire just to know ♪ That I 'm awake . ♪ It 's OK . You 're awake . What happened ? You were moaning in your sleep , Princess . Dreaming about the mongrel 's pouty lips , no doubt . ( CHUCKLES ) We need to go . This place isn 't safe . Why ? What did you see ? There 's a storm coming . A big one . CRISPIN : We need to move . Let 's go . Where 's your brother ? ARION : Hopefully halfway to Tyrsis by now . He 's gone to petition the Federation . He believes that building a coalition with the humans is key to surviving the Demon siege . Your brother is a fool , but no matter . We have more pressing concerns . ( DOORS RUMBLE ) The Druid has been lying to us . - Is this ... - The blade of the Warlock Lord . Forged by the Druid order to overcome dark magic . Strong enough to defeat the Dagda Mor . Thought this was destroyed after the Second War of the Races . So did I , but according to the Codex , it lies concealed in a vault beneath our city . Now , the Druid must have known that . Why would he hide such a thing ? You said he could be trusted . You said he was the only one with the power to protect ... I know what I said and I know what I 've done . ( SIGHS ) But if my fears are right , then we are vulnerable . I should have trusted you . I 'll find this blade . And if the Druid proves to be our enemy , then we will face him together . Thank you , son . You 're the only one I can trust . ( WIND WHISTLES ) CRISPIN : We need to find Safehold . We 'll rest when we 've reached the Mermiddon . Am I the only one who thinks staying the course is a bad idea ? - What do you mean ? - That Demon at the fort ? - It knew we were coming . - That 's impossible . Allanon said the Dagda Mor had a spy at Arborlon . - The Changeling . - We saw it die . - There could be another . - He 's right . We need to find another way to the Wilderun . There is no other way . Those mountains are impassable . There 's always Pykon . It offers passage through the Rock Spur and into the Wilderun beyond . Pykon ? - A fairytale , Princess . - CEPHELO : Pykon 's no fairytale . My parents died in the dungeons of that stinking Elvin fortress . While we argue , that storm is closing in . If you want to spend the next six days walking around the damn mountain , be my guest ! I 'm outta here . Wait . Take us there . - How long will it take ? - Half a day 's climb , tops . Try anything and I 'll let Crispin finish what he started . CRISPIN : Scouts , move out . Keep your eyes open . ( WIND WHISTLES ) ( GROWLING ) You shouldn 't be here . I just ... wanted to see him . He cannot sense your presence or your affection . Then do something ! You let this happen ! Heal him or ... I 'm trying , but his mind has gone dark . ( SCREAMS ) - ( SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) - BANDON : Get me out of here ! Help me ! ( SCREAMS ) - ( BANDON SCREAMS ) - Resist him , boy ! ( BOTH SCREAM ) ( SCREAMS ) - ( BLADE RINGS ) - Let her go ! Ugh ! Explain yourself . Go now . Leave me ! ( DISTURBING MUSIC ) Shh ! The King believes that the Druid may have been corrupted by the very same Demon leading the attacks . If that 's true , then Allanon may have sent Amberle into a trap . Cat , I need your help . There is a weapon hidden in a vault below the palace . If the Druid really is lost , it might be our only chance to defeat the Dagda Mor . I would do anything to avenge the Chosen , but I don 't know of any weapon . But you know this palace . There are miles of tunnels below . It 's got to be somewhere no-one would think to look . I 've heard whispers about a chamber beneath the dungeons . Some of the servants say it 's cursed , but it 's just talk . Show me . ( HORSE NEIGHS ) Slanter , wait . SLANTER : No . No . My People . Slaughtered by Demons . These monsters don 't discriminate . If we don 't unite against them , more innocents will die . I must say last rites to release their spirits . It is our custom . We 're almost at the Breakline . We don 't have time . ANDER : We 'll make time . What are you doing ? We 've been at war with the Gnomes for 30 years . Now we have a common enemy . This is an opportunity . SLANTER : Your earthly body yields . Flesh transformed to clay and ash to fertilise the fields . Born anew , conveyed on wings of light , to go with our fallen kin beyond the skies of sight . We should go . ( SLANTER GROWLS ) - Don 't do this . - Get back ! ( HORSES NEIGH ) SLANTER : Rah ! Hah ! ( GROWLS ) ( ROARS ) ( WIND WHISTLES ) Here ! It should be here ! - Maybe it 's the next peak over ! - Maybe it doesn 't exist at all . Your stupidity is gonna get us all killed ! CEPHELO : Well , I heard zero good ideas from you , Captain ! Here 's an idea - I slit your throat and use your body to fuel our fire . Killing each other won 't get us off this mountain . Guys ? ( SOARING MUSIC ) Nice-looking fairytale , isn 't it ? ( CHUCKLES ) AMBERLE : Come on . ( DOOR CREAKS ) ( WIND WHISTLES ) ( DOOR CLANGS SHUT ) Home sweet home . - Looks abandoned . - Looks can be deceiving . CRISPIN : Who the hell is she ? Anyone else have a problem with this plan ? Following a creepy kid through an abandoned fortress ? WIL : Not at all . Welcome . Please forgive my appearance . It 's been a long time since we had any company . You were expecting us ? Mag saw you coming up the mountain . Where are my manners ? I am Dontes Remikin . My friends call me Remo . What friends ? Well , back when we were operational . ( LAUGHS ) These days , it 's just Mag and me . Sir , Crispin Edensong , Captain of the Home Guard of Arborlon . You commanded this fort ? I was an officer during the war . Now I 'm ... I 'm just a ... a caretaker . We heard this place might offer passage beyond the mountains . There is nothing beyond the mountains but the Wilderun . That is no place for Elves . We 're on an urgent mission on the orders of King Eventine Elessedil . Then it is an honour to host such esteemed guests . I 'm afraid the passage you seek was destroyed two winters ago . It collapsed in an avalanche . You should stay until the storm passes . We have food , hot water . Our provisions are meagre , but they 're yours to share . Thank you . We will tell the King of your kindness . Good . Please , this way . ( WIND WHISTLES ) A royal bath must be something . Rose petals in the water . Servant girls massaging your back . Another princess joke . What 's my line ? " I didn 't know Rovers bathed at all " ? Something like that ? Well , at least we don 't lie to ourselves . We see something we want and we go after it . So it 's Rover custom to jump into bed with every guy you meet ? Honestly ? It 's not just guys . What ? Afraid you 'll like it ? ( HALF-LAUGHS ) You and Cephelo deserve each other . That mark , what does it mean ? I don 't know . I 've always had it . Guess it 's just how my first owner kept track of his property . ( DISTANT NOISE ) ( GASPS ) ( CLATTERING ) - What was that ? - Nothing good . We Rovers have a saying . " Golden offers are iron at their core . " - I don 't trust this Remo guy . - And I don 't trust you . - Your point ? - But I know my own kind . And that pointy-eared sonofabitch is lying about the avalanche . You know , if we found this place , so can the Demons . Maybe we should worry about that and not some Elvin janitor . - This fortress is impenetrable . - WIL : ls it ? We walked right in the front door . I 'd feel better if one of us kept watch . No-one 's stopping you , kid . Pardon the intrusion , but dinner is served . ( CHUCKLES ) Remo ! You beautiful bastard . I 'm so hungry , I could eat a Troll 's left nut . WIL : Sure . I 'll take first watch . I don 't need dinner or anything . ( CATANIA SNIFFS ) Smells like death ! Look at all these engravings . ARION : This must be the place . The Druid 's book showed a symbol . We need to locate it . It 's gotta be some kind of key . CATANIA : They all look the same . This is it . This is the one I saw . Find me the one that matches that . That 's how we find the weapon . There 's one here . ARION : Put your hand on it . The Codex says we need to touch it at the same time . ( HISSING ) Thank you . Don 't mind if we trade , do you ? Mine had too many peas in it . I hate peas . ( CHUCKLES ) Not at all . I 've missed Elvin cooking . - It 's an old family recipe . - Where are they , your family ? After the fort was decommissioned , my wife and I stayed on , to keep watch over the surrounding Troll settlements . She passed away a few years back . I 'm sorry . What about the men and women you tortured here ? - You sorry about them ? - Watch your tongue , Rover . It 's OK . I know the terrible rumours people whisper about this place . We even spread a few ourselves , hoping to intimidate our enemies . ( CHUCKLES ) But Pykon was a military outpost , nothing more . My parents might disagree if I could dig their bodies up from beneath your floor and ask them . I know you hate Elves , but we don 't murder prisoners of war . She 's right - if your parents were prisoners here , we would have released them when the war ended . Perhaps they chose to start a new life , free of their burdens . ( TENSE MUSIC ) Your ear . It 's like mine . Was your mother human ? My mother 's dead . Sorry to hear that . So is mine . So pretty . What is that ? A seashell . It belonged to my mom . Said it reminded her of where she came from . Have you ever seen the ocean ? It 's like the biggest bath you ever saw . Blue and sparkly . I can stare at it for hours , wondering what 's on the other side . Have you ever been outside ? For keeps ? Mag ... What ... What did you do ? It can be difficult passing the time in a place like this , just the two of us . There isn 't much in the way of entertainment . That 's why we 're so excited to have guests . ( WIND WHISTLES ) Where am I ? Shh ! It 's not safe . If he hears you ... You 're right . It 's not safe . I need to go , and you need to come with me . I can take you somewhere safe , somewhere you can play with other kids . Somewhere you can see the sun and the ocean . Are there seashells there ? More than you can count . ( MAN SCREAMS IN THE DISTANCE ) REMO : Come on ! Stop struggling ! ( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) No ! - ( REMO GRUNTS ) - ( SCREAMING AND GROANING ) MAG : I told you to be quiet . ( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) ( CREAKING ) ( DOOR SLAMS ) Ah , good . You 're awake . I was worried I 'd given you too strong a dose . A little wolf 's nettle , to bring on a nap . - Of course ... - Oh ! ( GRUNTS ) ... if you eat enough of it , like I do , your body builds up quite a tolerance . Your turn , Captain . - Wait ! - CRISPIN : Don 't tell him anything . My name is Amberle Elessedil , granddaughter to your lord and king , and by his command , I order you to release us . Bad idea . ( DISTURBING MUSIC ) A princess ? That changes everything . - Arggh ! - CEPHELO : You bastard ! My intention was to use the boy 's gift to reach Amberle . I thought he could help . ARION : What I saw was a man overcome by evil . You are not capable of understanding what you saw . KING : You 're not yourself , Allanon . The Dagda Mor used the boy to get inside my mind ! The Dagda Mor . Of course . The evil everybody fears but only you can see . Tell me , Druid , do you often commune with Demons ? What is the meaning of this ? ARION : Why conceal a weapon that has the power to protect us ? To protect you ? This sword is not a salvation . It is a talisman of evil . A darkness that is a danger to us all . It is you who are the danger , Druid . It was my mistake . I should have killed you the first time , Demon . ( GROANS ) Finish him . ( ALLANON BREATHES RAGGEDLY ) Arggh ! Where did he go ? What happened ? You did it , my son . The Druid is no more . ( AMBERLE WHIMPERS ) AMBERLE : Why are you doing this ? Because I was trained to . I don 't understand . Please help me understand . Many years ago , your grandfather , the noble and wise King Eventine , tasked me with the job of lead interrogator . It was my solemn duty to extract information from our enemies . But I 'm not your enemy . Oh , but you are . You all are . And after the war was over , Eventine sent men here to find me . Ah ! Imagine my surprise when they told me Pykon didn 't exist . Then they murdered my wife and attempted to kill me . I don 't believe you . My grandfather is an honourable man . He wouldn 't ... Doesn 't matter what you believe . I know the truth . ( WHIMPERS ) Please . I 'm on a mission to save the Ellcrys . If I die , the entire world will fall into darkness . I 've lived in the darkness for many years . ( CHUCKLES ) Darkness is my home . ( WHIMPERS ) No ! No , no , no , no , no ! ( SCREAMS ) No ! Please , no ! - The halfling ? - He tried to leave . Wil ! No ! AM BERLE : No ! No ! No ... ( CRIES ) Good girl . AMBERLE : No , please ... ( WIND WHISTLES ) Come on , kid . That 's it . ( CLANGING ) For the forebrain . I stick it through the nostril and tap it in , ever so gently , with this . ( TAPS ) ( CHUCKLES ) You can bear me a child , live as my wife . Just like Mag 's mother . She was scared too . But after a few taps , no more tears . ( REMO CHUCKLES ) But your body will be perfectly functional . AMBERLE : No ... Leave her alone ! Wil . Arggh ! I 'll leave you one eye so you can watch while I ravish her ! Arggh ! Ugh ! ( GURGLING ) Thank you . ( AMBERLE CRIES ) I thought I 'd lost you . Hate to break up the honeymoon , but I 'd like to get out of here . You 're safe now , but we need to go . You know a way out of here ? Alright . This way . This is madness . We 're lost . How could I have been so stupid ? I can 't believe I trusted a Gnome . I thought I could redeem myself for failing to protect Aine . Instead , his killer is galloping across the Four Lands to freedom . We all failed him . Everything changed that night . Yes , it did . The Ander I loved disappeared , lost in booze and anger and doubt . But I wake every morning hoping he 'll return . ( HORSE WHINNIES ) ANDER : Slanter . You 're right . I didn 't believe till I saw it with my own eyes . ( YELLING IN DISTANCE ) ( YELLING CONTINUES ) We 're doomed . ANDER : You 'll have to go on foot from here . You 're letting me go ? Your people deserve to know what 's coming . Now , go , before I change my mind . What chance do the Elves have against a force that size ? I don 't know . But for the sake of all the races , we must face it . - And you would do so alone ? - Perhaps it 's what we deserve . When I tell my tribe what happened to me , I will speak of your honour . In another life , we are not enemies . In another life . Behind there . A siege exit . This must lead to the pass . ( THWACK ! ) ( GASPS ) I have a rule here at Pykon . No-one leaves . Mag , come here . It 's over ! She 's coming with us . They 're taking me to a new home . This is your home ! You did this . You poisoned her with your lies ! Made her into a deceitful mongrel , like you ! - Don 't ! - WIL : No ! Mag ! - AMBERLE : You bastard ! - Arggh ! WIL : She 's dead . I 'm sorry . Come on . Help me open this door . - CEPHELO : Turn it . - CRISPIN : Together . Come on . - One . Two . - ( GRUNTING ) ( METAL SQUEAKS ) Come on . We have to go . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( WIND HOWLS ) ls that the Wilderun ? - Damn straight ! - ( ROARING ) - You 've got to be kidding rne . - We blew that thing up ! - Come on ! - Get Amberle out of here , now ! We 're not leaving you . I 'll be right behind you . Go ! ( SNARLS ) Come on ! What about the others ? We 'll send it back once we 're on the other side ! Ready ? Let 's go ! - ( DEMON GROWLS ) - ( CRISPIN GRUNTS ) Crispin ? - ( DEMON ROARS ) - Run ! ( HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ) What are you doing ? Saving our asses ! ( GRUNTS ) You said we 'd help them across ! Bring a Demon with ' em ' ? The hell with that ! Eretria ! Help us ! Eretria ! He 'll never choose you . So be it . - She made it . Let 's go ! - WIL : Come on . Come on ! - ( DEMON ROARS ) - That thing 's right behind us . Push off and don 't look back ! WIL : Keep going ! WIL : Don 't stop ! Sorry , kiddo . You deserved better . Just die already ! - ( DEMON ROARS ) - ( OTHERS YELL )

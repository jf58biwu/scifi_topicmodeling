 ¶ ¶ ¶ - Previously on killjoys ... - May i present delle seyah kendry , of land kendry . - I wanna say thank you . - For what ? - Saving my ass on that ship . - I took that jump for all of us . - Fine . Thank you . For all of us . - Doctor illenore pawter simms , you 're under arrest . - Johnny , i need you to figure out a way to track khlyen down with this . What the hell is that ? - A neurolink . We 'll be able to see and hear each other as if we 're in the same room . - The army doctor you 've been looking for ? - Dr. Jaegar , yeah . - If jaegar passed through there , i can probably help you find her . You remember having any surgery at all ? - No . - At least now we know you don 't have traumatic amnesia . Someone doesn 't want you to remember . ¶ ¶ ¶ - Got something ! - What is it ? - I 'm not sure yet . It 's a ghost image i extracted from the neurolink that khlyen put on you . You recognize it ? - I dunno , it 's hard to tell . - Well , it 's definitely indoors . - Why 's that ? - Isn 't that a window ? - Where ? - There . In the corner . - Lucy ? Upper right corner of image . Clear the noise and increase magnification as much as you can . That 's him , isn 't it ? That 's khlyen 's reflection . So this is a recording From his end of the link . I think we 're looking at the last thing That he saw before you broke your connection . - Almost got you , you bastard . ( powering down ) what happened ? - I don 't know . - Fix it . Make it come back . - Yeah , i 'm trying . - ' cause if we can get more images from this thing , maybe we can figure out where khlyen is- - - I 'm aware ! - Yeah , dutch , let 's get some air . Let johnny work . - I hope you didn 't drag me out here to talk about my feelings . - Well , that 's not really either of our style , now is it ? - Autotargets ? - Why shoot the shit when you can shoot at shit ? Thirty joys says i can kick your fine ass . Count to three . - You 're on , pretty boy . One , two- - - Well , shit . I can 't fix this thing if i don 't even know how it works . Lucy , if i engage with the device , can you scan me , Figure out how it works , so we can go from there ? - [ i cannot recommend using an object ] [ which we do not yet fully understand , john . ] - Said no good scientist , ever . Ok ... Here goes somethin ' . - Ha ! Winged it ! Tie . - I don 't believe in ties . That 's just quitting before you win . - Feeling better ? - Much . - Good . Now we can talk about your feelings . - Ass . - Why are you so desperate for johnny to find khlyen ? ( sighing ) - Because i want answers . He 's holding pieces of me hostage . Truths about my life I can 't get from anywhere else . Good or bad , I just wanna know my own story . See ? You think that 's stupid- - - no , That 's exactly why i need to find dr . Jaegar . I get it . ( buzzing sound ) You know , you 're pretty good with words , for a badass . - [ guys ! A little help ! ] - John- - - get it off ! Get it off ! - Johnny , you big idiot . What were you thinking ? - I was trying to figure out How it works , so i can fix it . But , in my defense : In scientific research , there 's a very thin line between stupid and genius . - Well , congratulations , you crossed it . - Can you see anything ? - No , no . It must not be turned on on khlyen 's end . All i 'm getting is a headache . - Ok ... ( yelling in pain ) - don 't touch it ! This ... This thing is my only shot At finding khlyen , we can 't risk damaging it . - Or me , right ? ! - Lucy , take us home . - Why ? - We gotta get you to pawter , she can extract it properly . - Aw man , surgery ? - Like i always tell you : Science , it 's dumb . - ¶ ¶ come come come uninvited ¶ ¶ ¶ run run run ' til i find ya ¶ ¶ i don 't care which side that you 're fighting ¶ ¶ gonna get you gone ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ - Hope i don 't still smell like westhole . Hills threw me in jail last night . - Hills arrested you ? For what ? - I may have possibly stolen his id code So i could look for your dr . Jaeger in the company records . - You said you had a connection . - I lied . - Did you find her or not ? - Close . - Ow , ow ! Easy , paw ! - Stop whining . - Yeah , well , stop digging at my brain shaft ! - I think i found a former patient of hers . A guy named grayson hicks . Filed complaints against a doctor That left him with your exact issues . - Oh , gross ! - Whoops ... I hope you didn 't need this . - Shit . Dutch , I broke it , i 'm sorry . Ok , i screwed up , i get that you 're angry- - - I 'm not angry , john . Ok , yes , I 'm pissed . But mostly i 'm scared . - Of khlyen ? - Of losing my one chance To get the upper hand and face him on my own terms . That was my only shot at taking him down . - I will find a way to fix this , ok ? I promise . - Soooo ... About this grayson guy ... - I left you messages . From jail . - I 'm sorry , i thought they were personal calls- - - And that makes it ok to ignore them ? Ohh , i get it . You were pulling a fade . Didn 't have the courtesy to break up to my face . - Break up ? This was never an official relationship . - You 're officially an asshole . - And you 've been nailing your patient , while treating him For mental trauma . So maybe i don 't get all the blame here . - Maybe you don 't . - Look ... Pawter ... I 'm a mess right now , and- - - Oh please , don 't . Spare me the broken-boy speech . I know it by heart by now . I 'll give you grayson 's location . I hope your team can use him to find jaegar . - Where is he ? - Somewhere i sincerely hope you don 't end up . ( alert signal ) - I told them if we dug any deeper this would happen , but did they believe me ? No . Now the whole damn building is out . Look , i 'm getting overtime on this . No , screw charlie ! Union rules . Hey , where 's your tech room ? - Excuse me ? - Your room ... Of tech ? Not sure how else to say it . - You can 't come in here without a pass . - Well , i can 't fix it from out here , Unless you have some workaround for basic physics . Do you ? Fine . Just sign this damn denial of service , let me get on with my night . Right here . Wait for it ... Annnd there . ( whistling ) - Are you grayson ? - Are you real ? - It 's ok , You 're not hallucinating . - Why are you in my room ? - I think the doctor who messed you up did the same thing to me . Do you remember where she treated you ? - That bitch is the one thing That i can 't forget . - How do we find her ? - I 'll take you right to her . As long as you take me with you . - Johnny , we 're go for plan b . - [ where to ? ] No way . You can get us in there ? Because i 've always wanted to geek out with the tech-pirates , but it 's invite only . - You 're invited . But you can 't go in there dressed like normies And smelling like cops . - Why is everyone looking at me ? I can be cool . ¶ ¶ ¶ - Best . Undercover . Ever ! Except for d 'av ! - You 're just jealous 'cause i make this work . - Welcome to utopia . - What the hell is this place ? A club , or a market ? - Yes , and yes . - Sex , drugs , meds , and tech . Everything illegal and freaky in the quad is for sale In utopia . - So the doctor deals here ? - Yeah , we all call her Dr. Bliss . She sells a memory mod treatment.Reatment. Really badass stuff . You guys wait here , and i 'll go see If the doctor 's still selling here . - I , um ... I 'm gonna go check a few things out while we wait . Super nerdy . You guys would be bored . - Yeah , fine . Go . We 'll be here . Weirdo . - Follow me , leather boy . - Mood mods ? Ten minute samples , first hit 's free . Euphoria in a bottle . - No thanks . I 'm good . Wait , ten minutes ? - Mm-hmm . - What the hell . I 'm not supposed to be myself tonight . - What 's gotten into you ? - You 're the one who put me in leather . - You carleen ? - Almost done here . What do you need ? - I hear you 're the woman to talk to , when it comes to fringe biotech . You ever seen one of these ? - Keep it clean , come back in a week . Aren 't you a sexy bitch . What is she ? - It 's a neural interface Of some kind . Busted . Can you fix it ? - Slow down , sailor . You 're not nervous , are you ? - What you said this morning , About khlyen having your missing pieces , Jaegar having mine ... - What about it ? - All this time we 've spent finding them- - What if we don 't like what they have to say ? - What do you want her to say ? - That it 's not my fault . You 're pretty . - I take it it 's working , then ? What are you doing ? - I found her . She 's working in the back . Um ... Uh ... Do you guys- - do you need a minute ? - We 're gonna need about eight . - Ok . - This is grade a mechorganic shit you have here . - What is that ? - New kind Of biotech hybrid . " living technology " . Look here . This ? Is a fragment of actual neural cortex . That liquid 's probably cerebrospinal fluid ... All connected with chips and gears . It 's amazing . - So you have seen this before ? - Honey , no one in the quad 's seen this before . She is a long way from home . I have a connection who can maybe help . - But ? - If i get her fixed , Once you 're done with her , she 's all mine . Deal ? - [ johnny , get to the back room . Grayson found his doctor . ] - Well , i guess i don 't have a choice . - We need to talk . - It 'll be a short conversation . That 's not her . Too young to be jaegar . - But you know that name . Dr. Jaegar . - Mmm . No , but i do know That you need to leave . So ... - And i know that you need my permission to keep breathing . - Oh , dr . Jaegar . - There we go . What 's your connection ? We know you used her treatment on grayson . - I was her assistant , when the company first brought her over to the quad . - Not a good fit ? - Well , she had no vision . She was a total corporate whore . I told her , there 's a huge consumer need for this type of service . We could 've cornered the market . But , oh no , she wanted to dance with the ones that brought her . - So she stayed with the company and you stole her technique . - No . I improved it . Jaegar just removed memories . I implant them . Ask grayson . You wanna know what it feels like To base jump ? Or kill someone ? I can source that for you , baby . - So where is she now ? - Well , we don 't exactly Exchange birthday cards . Sorry . I guess you 're shit out of luck . - Ooh , looky here . All your specs on jaegar 's technique . You don 't mind if we borrow this , do you ? - Little bit . Yeah . Kinda need that . - Well , karma called , and she said suck it . You stole from jaegar , Now we steal from you . - [ approaching westerley . ] - Appreciate the initiative , johnny , But what the hell are we supposed to do with this ? - Give it to pawter . See what she says . - Yeah . She probably doesn 't want to talk to me right now . - John , you ask her . Everybody likes you . - It 's not my fault i 'm charming . - You three . Id . - Rac agents . - Hey ! What 's your problem ? - Drop your weapons on the ground , now ! Do it ! - Boys ! Stand down . - What 's the charge ? - Kidnapping a patient from a company facility . - Grayson ? That 's bullshit , We 're on an official mission . - Yeah ? Show me your warrant , smart guy . Got the team leader . Bringing her in . ( door sliding ) - Hello ... Yalena . - How do you know that name ? - Oh , i know a lot of interesting things about you now . I 'm a curious woman . - And a bit of a stalker . Or am i supposed to believe you being here is a coincidence ? - I may have possibly put a little alert on your name In the company system . So i wouldn 't miss an opportunity like this . I do so love rescuing a damsel in distress . - What do you want , seyah ? - A little trade , Just between us girls . My company will drop all charges Against you and your team , in exchange for a future favor Of my choosing . - You can just hire me . - Strictly off the books . No questions , no hesitation , No warrant on record . I snap , And you come . - You must be one hell of a snapper . Ok , i 'll play . But it 's going to cost you a bit more . I 'm looking for a doctor who works for the company . I want 24 hours alone with her . No security , no repercussions , or no deal . How bad do you want me ? - You can 't just make a deal like that Without talking to us . - It got us here , didn 't it ? - I can 't believe she 's been on westerley this whole time . - It 's a big moon . You ready ? For real , this time ? - What do you mean security left their stations ? Who pulled them ? - I 'm trying to find out- - - that would be us . Favor from a friend , so we could talk uninterrupted . Is that her ? - That 's her . Do you remember me ? - I do . You 're a long way from home , soldier . - I 've been looking for you Up and down the j . - Well , you found me . Sit , sit . How was the treatment ? - I know i butchered my people . And i know the army went in and took back the memories before i was discharged . That was you . - You shouldn 't have any memory of that at all . - What else ? What else did you people do to me ? - Nothing . You asked us to take the memories . After what you did to your squad . - But why did i kill them ? That 's the part i can 't remember . Was it an experiment , a test , was i on something- - - I can 't rewrite history for you , son . I 'm sorry . You killed them because you had a psychotic break in the line of duty . Then the army did What it always does ; covered it up . ( banging table ) - bullshit ! There has to be a reason . There has to be More of a reason . - Ok , ok ! Enough . Can you at least Finish the job ? Get rid of the residual memories ? They 're torturing him . - Gladly . The technique has come A long way . You can get back in the machine any time you want . - Yeah , i don 't know about that . - Can you give me back my memories ? Can you reverse the treatment ? - Theoretically , but why would you do that to yourself ? - Can we do it now ? - Whoa . Slow down . - Dutch- - - D 'avin- - - it 's the only way i 'll ever understand . - You need to think about this . And that 's an order . - D 'av , she 's not wrong . We at least need to talk about this . - I appreciate your concern , But it 's not your business . - Bullshit ! We 're a team . It 's very much our business Whether you let someone go digging in your damn brain . ( sighing ) - when he gets like this , you just gotta give him some space . He 'll come around . ( device beeping ) I gotta go take care of something . We 'll try again When i get back . Ok ? Carleen ? I 'm on my way . - Hurry it up . - I can 't find the files . - Move . - I know what you 're doing . Getting those memories back isn 't about moving on , It 's about punishing yourself for what you did . But try seeing the one positive in this amnesia . I mean , Do you have any idea what i 'd give to forget some of the things i 've done ? - Yeah , that 's not the same thing , dutch . You killed in the line of duty . I murdered my men . - Let 's not compare sins here , ok ? I 'll win . - You don 't understand . - Neither do you . The first time i killed someone , i was eight years old . - How ? - Poisoned tea . - No , i mean , How does that even happen ? - It doesn 't matter . - Dutch , it matters . Khlyen ? You said he was your tutor . - Yeah , that 's what he taught me . Killing . I 'm not judging you right now , 'cause i don 't have any right to . So whatever you 've done , i promise you , i have done worse . If you can 't be forgiven , Then what chance is there for me ? - I 'm sorry . - ¶ ¶ my eyes are set on you ¶ ¶ i 'm going in for the kill ¶ ¶ no one could ever touch me ¶ ¶ like you will ¶ ¶ i 'm going in for the kill ¶ ¶ - Ok , i know it 's been a rough couple of days , but i finally got some good news . I fixed khlyen 's device , so i splurged on a bottle of ten-joy-hokk to celebrate , So come get some ! - ¶ i met someone ¶ ( moaning and panting ) - Guess you 're already getting some . - Are you sure you want to do this ? - You know , if we do this again , we 're gonna need a bigger bed . - I 'll speak to the owner . - We 're awesome at this whole sex thing , by the way . - Are you naked high-fiving me right now ? ( chuckling ) - So who 's going to say it ? - What ? - That this doesn 't have to change anything . - Is that an order ? Or a decree ? You know , you never did explain that whole ... Royal-harem thing . - What about it ? - I just wanna know If i 'm bedding a warrior princess . - Actually , yes . But that was all through my marriage . - You 're married ? - Widowed . - Sorry . I didn 't mean To get personal . - I think we got plenty personal today . No , it 's ... It 's fine . I just don 't want johnny Coming back and finding us together . - Oh shit . Johnny . You know he 's going to say we can 't handle this . - We can , though . Right ? - Tap my heart . You look good in my things , by the way . - Oh , shut up . Lucy , when did johnny get back ? - [ he boarded : 8 minutes , 29 seconds ago . ] [ he exited : 2 minutes , 10 seconds later . ] - Shit . ( shrill vibration ) ( grunting in pain ) Don 't bother getting dressed , We 're already ... Busted . D 'avin ? D 'avin , what are you doing ? D 'avin , stop ! John , come in ! D 'avin , what are you doing ? - [ john has disengaged his com . I will keep trying him . ] - D 'avin , it 's me ! ( cracking sound ) ( screaming ) ¶ ¶ ¶ - Troubles ? - I may have , hypothetically , walked in On dutch and my brother , how they say , " in flagrant dictation " . - " in flagrante delicto " . - Whatever . - You 're jealous . Finally ! - Excuse me ? - Don 't blame d 'avin For climbing the tree , when all you were gonna do was sit by it . - Whoa , whoa , You are way off . This is not- - - yeah . - Dutch is family . This is not jealousy , it 's like , um ... It 's like my brother ... Is banging my sister . - Yeah , ok , I see your point . Just ... Still . We all knew they were heading here . Might as well get it over with . - Yeah , and then what ? It 's kinda hard to have casual sex with someone you live with . And they 're both ... I mean , they 're both terrible At relationships . I mean epically incompetent . So , whatever this is , It can 't last , And they know that it can 't last . And then i have to pick a side . - You 'll pick hers . - I will . That make me a bad brother ? - Makes you an excellent friend . I 'm guessing she 's earned that from you . - It 's just that dutch has drawn A bunch of short straws when it comes to guys . And i just ... I don 't want my brother being on that list . - Sweetie . I wouldn 't worry . This is dutch we 're talking about . Not a lot he can do to hurt our girl . - Lucy , cut the lights in cargo bay . - [ shutting down now . ] - I know you 're down here . - I don 't want to hurt you . - Well , i need to hurt you . - Why ? - I have my mission . I 'm a good soldier . - Well , i 'm a better one . - What happened ? - Your brother ... - What about him ? What 's wrong ? - He , uh ... He just ... He just ... He just changed . He went off on me , like ... Like someone pulled a switch . Johnny , he tried to kill me . - D 'avin ? C 'mon ! - John- - - No , no , no , no . He wouldn 't do that . - He turned on me , like he turned On his squad , hours after finding jaegar . You think that 's a coincidence ? She did this , i know she did . She 's controlling him somehow . - Ok , ok , What ... What do we need to do ? - I 'm going back to jaegar . She 's going to fix this , or i 'm going to break her , a piece at a time . You stay here . Watch your brother , he 's ... He 's in the cargo hold . Be careful . ( door opening ) - Hi , johnny . - What the hell did you do to her ? - Just pack the essentials . - Was it something we said ? Guessing you didn 't expect to see any of us alive again . - No , But i prepared for it just in case . - Johnny , i need help with a security field . Johnny ? - It 's a black zone . No outside communication . Make yourself comfortable . We 'll be gone soon . - Why ? Hey ! You need to shake this off , d 'av . I know the real you is still in there . Remember our last winter at kipsey ? That fat kid randy , The one who always stole our skates ? Boy , we hated him . But you still risked your ass for his when he fell through the ice . You just went in right after him . That was the scariest five minutes of my life , Waiting for you to come back . That is who you are . You do the right thing better than anyone i know . And you always Come back . Ok , so we 're gonna fix you . Dutch is with jaegar right now , she 's working on it . - Thank you . I 'm a good soldier . - D 'av ... - So , i think i figured out what you really did to d 'avin . - And what exactly is that ? - Turned him into some kind Of human weapon you could target at whoever you want . - That 's a simplistic description , But you seem a simplistic woman . - I 'm not the one with the flawed technique . You 're not as good as you think you are , or else he never would have remembered . - Perfection is a process . Our mandate was to turn soldiers against their own forces . And i assure you , we succeeded . If it makes you feel any better , it was only meant to be a proof Of concept demonstration , no casualties . - Yeah ? What went wrong ? - We underestimated your friend 's determination to kill . Cost me my job . Your soldier friend almost tracked me down once before , On our home world . My deal with the company included Placing a kill warrant on him , in case he followed me to the quad . - That was you ? - And now they 've let me hang out to dry . I have to say , You have some very impressive connections . - I may not be a genius , doc , but i can count to three . One ... Two ... Three . - Lucy , get me a doctor . - [ i need more specifics , john . ] [ john ? ] [ john ? ] [ i don 't know what to do . ] - You should know : My work is important . You have no idea what 's coming to the quad , What it could mean for all of us- - - Here 's what i know : You hurt my friend . He hurt me . And now i 'm going to hurt you . So that you can 't do this to him , Or anyone else , again . - He 's here . Outside . - Turn him off . Now . - Now why would i do that ? He 's programmed to kill his team . He 's no threat to me . - I am . - Shut him down . ( moaning ) - are you all right ? ( shrill vibration ) - What 's happening ? Dutch ? - [ show me your eyes . ] Just finishing something . [ hang tight . ] - What happens now ? - We both know i can 't leave you like this . He 'll never be safe again . You know how to run that thing ? I 'm gonna give you something you never gave d 'avin : A choice . The gun , Or the memory-wipe procedure . - The gun . - Procedure it is . Strap her in . Take her memories . All of them . - [ identify yourself . ] - Pawter . You called . - [ you are required in cargo hold . ] - Lucy , what 's his blood type ? - [ john andras jaqobis ] [ is blood type o . ] - put me through to the nearest company med ship . - [ this is med ship avignon , ] [ come in . ] - avignon , this is an all-request emergency evac To my location , medical authorization number : 5-4-alpha-9 . Priority code : Angel . That means get your asses here now ! - [ i 'm sorry , doctor , ] [ med ships aren 't approved for your sector . ] - This is illenore seyah simms of land simms , And if you ignore my call , i will have you staked in the rain . - [ we are en route , seyah . ] - You bet your ass you are .

He 's gonna be ok . He was asking for you . - Yeah ... I should probably let him rest .

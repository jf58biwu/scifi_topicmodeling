 Previously on " Fear the Walking Dead " ... We need that . ‭ No , we don 't . There is no more good . There is no more bad . This is how it works now . Get out of the truck ! Goddamn you , Chris ! Open the gate ! You didn 't do anything wrong . I left him . If anyone raises a hand to another , they 're out . Oh , you don 't believe I was bitten ? I don 't believe in miracles . If we don 't make this trade now , those men 'll come for us . Ofelia chose to go . Come on , come on ! Damn it . Now at least I understand . What ? _ You understand ? Let 's hope so . What are you doing ? Just thinking . Been here all night ? Pretty much . That 's a lot of thinking . I 'm just trying to find the words to say what I want , in a way that you 'll hear . There 's nothing to say , Mad . Bullshit . Travis ... you kept your promise to Liza . You did . She asked you to protect him , and in this world ... this new world , where the rules are different and always changing , that 's exactly what you did . He 's safer where people understand him . I want to believe you . I know . That 's not going to happen right away . I 'm gonna make you a promise . I 'm gonna hold on to it for you . Remind you every chance I get until you do believe it . You belong here . So , when you 're ready , come downstairs . _ _ Oxy . _ Yeah ? Hey . Hey . You hungry ? Yeah . They cook everything in here in lard . It 's pretty delicious . Should I ? Yeah , sure . Travis , I 'm sorry . I feel like I pushed Chris further away by being so ... No . You were scared . You had every right to be . Look ... Chris ... he 's sick . I couldn 't see it . He 's my son . Look , I 'm sorry that I didn 't believe you . I 'm sorry that I ... I didn 't protect you better . I should have . It 's okay . It 's okay . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ I 'm offering you this . We deliver every week on time . Your word , you leave us alone . _ I like you . You 've got nothing to hide , not like any Gringo I ever met . But the game 's over . We don 't need your shit anymore . You see that guy ? He controls all the drugs left in Tijuana . His people and my people , we didn 't used to get along . Now I got something he wants . And we are like best friends now . You know what I got ? A fortress . I know how you get in , out , using the sombras as your army . Very chill nights up on that hill . So , if you don 't want to die , leave today . I don 't give a shit what happens to your people . So , you run back and say this ... you leave now ... or die . Hey , how 'd it go last night ? Better than expected . A night of sleep without fear is good for the soul . Hey . Andrés hasn 't slept . Most people haven 't seen a doctor since it began . - They seem appreciative . - That 's good . Oh . What 's that smell ? - Dude , don 't say it . - Wait , don 't say what ? - Don 't say it . - What , that it smells like " Mexcrement " ? Your countrymen . Can we kick them out ? Seriously , they 're actually awful . Where did they come from ? They showed up late last night . They were in a wreck . Andrés says that one 's got a dislocated shoulder . He didn 't have the heart to send them away . My man needs some medical attention . - Hello ? Por favor ! - All right , I 'm gonna see what I can do . Keep your voices down . Oh , don 't worry , ma 'am . These people are docile . Oh , yeah ? Well , I 'm not . So , you guys were in an accident ? Yeah , sorry . My buddy 's in a lot of pain . I think it 's dislocated . What about you ? You got banged up , too ? No , not even a scratch . I swear , Derek made some kind of a deal with the devil . I mean , the truck must 've rolled , what , a dozen times ? I get this . The driver ... Our buddy who was driving ... he didn 't make it . I 'm sorry . What happened ? He let an idiot drive is what happened . Now our truck is totaled , and we 're stuck here in a sea of border bandits . It 's not my fault , Brandon . Dude , I 'm just stating the facts . No , you 're the one who said he wasn 't pulling his own weight . I didn 't know the guy didn 't have his license , you did . Seriously , who the hell grows up in L.A. without a license ? I don 't know , man . He was only 16 . Yeah , when I was 16 I 'd been driving for over a year . Derek , you said your name was ? Yeah , that 's right . Strand ? What now ? Two American guys showed up last night . They were in an accident . The guy that was driving their truck was killed . That 's tragic . And ? They 're the guys that Travis left Chris with . You sure ? Derek and Brandon . And just the way Travis described them , what are the chances of that ? Travis can 't know they 're here . If I get rid of them , then we don 't get the truth about Chris . Or I know , I suspect , and I don 't tell Travis ? Isn 't it his right to know ? The old rules of conduct no longer apply . Breathe . Okay , Travis abandoned his only child . - No , he didn 't . - He left him with these men . - He didn 't abandoned him . - He left him with these men . Yes . And I told him it was the right thing to do for Chris . I told him it was the best thing to do . Let me ask you something , what keeps you going ? In this world , what gets you up in the morning ? My kids ... Nick , Alicia . That 's right . With her , you 've got this amazing young woman , this amazing young woman who you wake up to every single day . And with Nick , it 's the hope that he 's out there , alive . - He is . - And the hope that you 'll see him again . I have that hope with Thomas . But now the ... It 's a dark place , Madison . Do you think Travis can survive losing that hope ? He 's already broken . That 'll kill him . It 's not ... we can 't take 300 people ... - Es verdad , but we need to tell ... - Nick . Okay , give me a second , all right ? You went there , didn 't you ? - Don 't lie to me . - I 'm not , I 'm not , yes . I went to see Marco , okay ? We made the drop . I know Alejandro told me not to , but I had to . They found us . Lucy , they 're coming for the colonia . How ? When ? Soon . We have to tell Alejandro now . Luciana . Yes . Okay . Hey , hey . I am sorry I snuck away , all right , and I 'll never lie to you . - I told you not to go there , Nick . - I had to , okay ? I was worried if they were coming for us , it was going to be soon . - It is . - We are outnumbered , outgunned . They know how to get in and out . All we have going on for us is gone . How can you say that ? We need a plan , Alejandro . Okay , I 'll get Reynaldo and the other scouts . We 'll gather supplies while you tell the others . But , look , we need to leave now . Today , okay ? We pack what we can , we get everyone together and we start walking . Nick ! No . No , no . What is it ? Just worried about time . We don 't have a lot . It is faith what matters most . It is this what will protect us . This will be a crowd-pleaser . Andrés is gonna fix your shoulder . Well , it 's about time . Hey , you sure you know how ? Yeah , I 'm sure . But it 's gonna hurt like hell . Let 's get you somewhere with a little more privacy . You have a room . Oh , we 're getting out of this shit-hole ? That 's the best news I 've heard in days . Got it ? Let 's go . _ _ _ _ _ _ Go , go ! Open the gate . These assholes are leaving . Chris ! Chris ! Travis ? Travis ! Dear God . Whoa , whoa , whoa , Paco . What the hell you doing ? No , no , hey . You can 't do this . - No ! - You have to go . You gotta go . They 're gonna kill you . - Then protect us . - We 'll die out there . No . No way we 're going out . - No goddamn way . - Wait , stop ! Stop ! - Maddie ! Wait ! - Get off me ! Stop ! Where 's Chris ? Where 's my son ? Come on , Brandon , tell me where he is . Where is my son ? Come on , tell me . I need to know . What is it ? I 'm leaving . We 're leaving . Faith is not going to protect us when the shooting starts . We 're not leaving . Alejandro needs us . That 's not a reason to stay . Our people need us . - Alejandro 's gonna find an answer . - No . He won 't find any answers , okay ? He can 't . Clean it good ? Antiseptic ? What is it you think you saw , Nick ? I saw you afraid . Yesterday , you were afraid of people leaving . Today , you 're afraid of that bite . I was shaken . - There 's a difference . - You 're lying . You 're petrified . What are you talking about ? Tell her . You want to do this ? No , I don 't . But they are coming to kill us . Look , the only way I am going to get her to leave is if you tell her what you really are . - Cállate . Enough . - Tell her ! Enough ! What are you talking about ? I am not immune . You 're warm . He 's infected . But I saw it . I saw him bit . - I saw it . - You saw what you wanted to see . I was bitten by the boy . The addict I tried to save . People told a story they wanted to believe . I didn 't disabuse them of it . I told the story , not people . Me , my brother . You let us believe you . Why ? When they started to rally around me , I knew that we could build this place to protect ourselves . You mean they could build it to protect you . I have fear . I didn 't want to die . And I knew I would out there . But more people survived because of this place . More people survived than died because of my lie . No one survives what 's coming , okay ? Look , I 'm sure as shit not committing suicide for a fraud . Lucy , please . Just come away with me . - Lucy . - Please . Lucy . _ _ _ And you ... - you 're my ... - _ _ _ - Lucy , por favor . - No . We have to go . I 'm not leaving . We have to . We have to go now , okay ? No . This place , this is what matters . This is my home , like I 've never known one . But you don 't have to die for it . I 'm not planning on dying . - The faith we have , it has protected us . - It 's a lie . It doesn 't mean it hasn 't worked . We have fared better here than out in the world . Better than we fared even before this all started . For most of us this is the first time we have a place , a family . I 'm not leaving . Our Father , Who art in heaven . Hallowed be Thy Name . Ah , ah , ah , ah , ah . Come on . Come on . Buenas días , señorita . Welcome to America . I 'll tell you everything , all right ? I will , man , but I can 't think straight with my arm like this . Yeah , can you fix my man 's shoulder , Travis ? Please ? Can you do that ? Trav ? It 's okay , Maddie . I ... I just need to know . Okay ? Here . - That 's it ? - Yeah , you 'll be sore a few days , but that 's it . Now , tell me . What happened to my son ? Look , we 'll tell you what happened . All right ? But ... Look , we 're scared here , Travis . Now , you gotta promise something . - Please . - We 'll tell you . We 'll tell you . Come on , we 'll tell you ! But we need to know we 're being put out . We can 't go with no vehicle . We need a car to get back . - Done . - Madison . No , I said it 's done . We didn 't get far . After we left . Wasted . Banditos on the highway ... it was all one step forward , two steps back . We were on no sleep . Me and Derek doing the driving . We could barely keep our eyes open . Chris ... he volunteered , man . Okay , look , we didn 't ask . He offered . Yeah , he wanted to contribute . What happened next ? It went sideways , man . He must 've dozed off . I 'm sorry . The next thing you know ... we started rolling . The truck must 've rolled a half a dozen times . Chris went through the windshield . He was dead when we found him . Was he ? - What ? - Was he dead when you found him ? Yeah . Yeah , man , he was . I 'm sorry , Travis . His neck was sort of jacked , you know ? Like he broke it going through the glass . Trav ? Yeah . Where is he ? Where 's Chris ? Where did you leave my son ? We took care of him after , Travis . We pulled him out and we ... we buried him by the tree . He would 've liked it . So , was he thrown or did you pull him out ? What ? - Which was it ? - No , he was thrown . He was thrown and we pulled him the rest of the way to the tree . - Travis . - Let them go . Just let them go . Let them go . Travis , what the hell , man ? Travis ? Travis ! - Travis ! Travis ! - Hey ! - No , Travis ! - Stop ! What did you do ? Tell me what happened . What did you do ? Tell me . Tell me the truth . - Tell me what happened ! - Travis , stop ! Travis ! Tell me the truth . - Travis . - Please ! Get the keys . Get the goddamn keys ! Tell me ! Where 's my son ? All right , Travis , we 'll tell you , man . - Please let him go . - Where 's my son ? We 'll tell you , man . Please ! We 'll tell you if you promise to stop . Please . Travis . No . No . Please . All right , we did it . We killed him . All right , we put him down . We had to . We had to , man . We had to . Travis , no . Please stop . Please . Travis , you have to stop . Please . Hey , stop ! That 's enough ! Travis , no . - Rah ! - Travis ! Travis , stop it ! Trav ! That 's enough , Travis . Travis ! Travis . Travis , let him go . - No , please stop . - Travis , no . - Please . - Travis ! Please , stop it !

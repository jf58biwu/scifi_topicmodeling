 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Coulson : This is what gave you your super-strength ? We used a modified version of that formula you confiscated from Agent Johnson 's father . S.H.I.E.L.D. isn 't going away . We need to strike back . - I can assemble a team . - That won 't be necessary . I think it 's time The Superior sends some men of his own . Anton Ivanov , a reclusive industrialist - with a submarine . - Coulson : Bingo . You said you wanted to destroy the Inhumans and the thing that brought them upon us . - What is it ? - A man . You can help me get to him ? You 're not May . He switched you , didn 't he ? Where 's the real May ? How 's our guest ? She 's been a model patient , even with the move . We 'll find her . I promise . 4x13 - Boom [ " Romance An√≥nimo " plays ] _ I 'd be the first to admit that I 've followed my worst instincts at times . Last year . Loss will make you do that . It feels good in the moment ... Gracias . ... but it never ends well . I 've lost my temper . I 've killed . But lately ... I have this voice in my head telling me not to go down that path again . It 's telling me to be patient , to stay steady . Mack : I take it you don 't mean me , sir . It 's Agent May . She 'd tell me to stay on mission . Mack : Listen to the woman . She knows what she 's talking about . Hold on . This could be her . [ Music ] Coulson : Careful . This woman disappeared from her old life . We don 't know if we can trust her , - but she could be ... - I know . She could lead us to May . [ Music ] Damn it . I don 't have confirmation . Her face will be all the confirmation we need . Buenos dias , Roberto . [ Australian accent ] I 'll have the usual , please . Ready to go , Agnes . How is your day ? Good day so far , thanks . [ Camera shutter clicking ] I 'd say that 's confirmation . [ Music ] [ Sighs ] My God ... Aida , it 's astonishing . Agent May kept finding the edges of our simulations . That 's no longer a concern , given the Earth has no edges . It 's round . I understood that conceptually , we were building a world , but I-I didn 't expect you would build our entire world . With slight improvements . And Agent May ... she 's ... happy ? The clinical definition of happy is difficult to quantify . But she meets much of the criteria . Well , then , that 's a yes . [ Sighs ] Whatever price we needed to pay for the Darkhold ... it was worth it . [ Music ] Welcome , welcome . Morning checkup ? It 's midnight . - Does that thing have to be in here ? - Of course not . Well , this place is perfect . All the power we need . And undetectable ? I believe so . I 've lived here for many years . Great ! But that ... that book ... you really shouldn 't ... touch that . - It 's ... It 's dangerous , powerful . - I 'm aware . - I read it while you were sleeping . - You did what ? ! I specifically said it was mine to examine , decipher ... You said it would help me find a solution ... - to eliminate the Inhuman problem . - I said don 't touch it ! Could warp the senses , corrupt the mind . Relax . I glanced at it , and it gave me a simple answer . You . [ Music ] Why do you think you 're still alive ? As we discussed when you first arrived , we have plans ... - for a future together . - Yes . I 've already worked out the first step . You found an Inhuman to dangle in front of S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Well , no . Because as you 're aware , they are not easy to come by . [ Music ] Until now . Pure Terrigen crystals . I picked up some samples last year when I was working for a ... previous benefactor . His goals were ... well , the complete opposite of yours , so I 've been working to refine the compound , grow it ... Superior ... The ... The chemical in this pure form is harmless to humans . If you 're a potential Inhuman , however ... - it will turn you . - We 're counting on it . [ Alarm blaring ] Oh , for the love of ... What now ? Oh , that 's for me . Dial in that scanner . I can 't have it detecting every metal clothes hanger as an LMD . - Coulson 's a prosthetic hand , for God sakes . - Yes , sir . [ Music ] That 's enough for now . [ Treadmill beeping ] Agent Simmons ? It 's not good news , I 'm afraid . The serum that 's been giving you your strength ... it ... is ... potentially lethal . So you 're saying it 's ... a little risky . I 'm saying it 's Russian roulette . You 've been fortunate so far , but the next injection ... might cause cardiac arrest . And if it doesn 't , the one after is even more likely to kill you , - and so on and so on until ... - Geez . Don 't sugarcoat it , Doc . And by that , I mean , please , go ahead and sugarcoat it . [ Sighs ] I 'm sorry . I know General Talbot was hoping to replicate what was done to Steve Rogers , but ... [ Inhales deeply ] but you 'll never be Captain America . But , you know , I agreed not to take the serum until you completed the medical tests . I 'm even in daily physical conditioning , learning to fight . Yeah , and I hear you 're doing well . Agent Piper had me pinned in 10 seconds this morning . - Tomorrow , it will be 12 . - No , you don 't understand . I need my strength . We 're already a man down . Look , we are all doing everything to find Agent May . I know . And I 'm a team player . I 'm willing to play any position that gets us the win . But I already went from head coach to quarterback , and now you 're telling me I 'm gonna be on the bench for the season ? Sir ... [ Chuckles ] I have no doubt you will find your place on the footie squad . Ladies and gentlemen , straight from engineering and complete with all the modifications that you requested . Director Mace , say goodbye to your briefcase , because you now have a serum-delivery device on the belt of your suit . Just one turn , and the injection is delivered directly into the ... The tests ... The tests didn 't go that well , did they ? Okay . Well , in that case , it 's also good that we added a heart monitor and a GPS , - so when you do use the injection ... - Fitz . He can 't . - It 's too dangerous . - Oh . [ Music ] You could ... could 've told me that before I did my whole big presentation . Director , we got to keep you on schedule . Oh , thank God . [ Music ] Daisy : If our friends in Calgary could take asset 63-D94A , that would be better . She 's gonna need a cold climate . And remember , the relocation data is for S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s eyes only , so if you get any pushback , you know how to find me . Copy that , Agent Johnson . Inhuman relocation ? The people who want to kill them have the Darkhold . We have to assume that every Inhuman is a potential target . Senator Nadeer is gonna fight us on this . The Sokovia Accords give her a right to their locations . That 's why you 'll make sure the U.N. backs our play , no matter how many grueling bureaucratic conference calls you have to make . [ Tap on shoulder ] [ Computer beeping ] Phil , how 's the fishing expedition ? Turns out Fitz was right . Radcliffe didn 't create Aida out of thin air . He modeled her after someone ... a woman named Agnes Kitsworth . Australian expat living in Spain . We 've been surveilling her , but she seems uncompromised . Well , let 's hope she can lead us to Agent May . So how can I help ? You 're doing it . Mm , I want to be here for you , Phil . Radcliffe has the Darkhold , May is missing , Nadeer and her Russians are gunning for the Inhumans . I need to do something more . I know . I felt the same way when I started working with the Avengers . It 's not easy to find your place when you 're working with heroes and gods . So what did you do ? I did my best to protect the team . Turns out I had a role to play . You 'll make the right decision at the right time . Or you 'll get an Asgardian staff through the chest . - I 'd try to avoid that part . - Goes without saying . Thanks , Phil . [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Music ] It 's a replica , you know . - The original 's in Majorca . - Yeah , I know . You know because you 've spent time in Majorca or because you know a thing or two about replicas ? [ Chuckles ] I 'm sorry . Have we met ? Not yet . But I know about the work you did with Holden Radcliffe . [ Music ] Our work ? You don 't know anything . - Then help me to understand . - Okay . I don 't want anything to do with that man ever again . Understand ? Now leave me alone . We 're with S.H.I.E.L.D. We need to talk . Show her . [ Tablet beeps ] [ Music ] Agnes : Oh , my God . He actually did it . Nadeer : If the U.N. want to play hardball , then we 'll throw harder . I want the public up in arms about S.H.I.E.L.D. hiding Inhumans in their backyards , - and I want it by the evening news . - I 'll call a press conference . And book me some follow-up appearances on talk radio ... you know which networks ... and ... [ Music ] What are you doing here ? I need a word . You 're comfortable with them hearing this ? I have no secrets from my staff . Mm . We 've been discussing your role in this . You 've been very impressive on the front lines , proven over and over again your commitment to this cause . Thank you . I 've made some sacrifices , yes . I saw it myself . And I 've wondered ... which was worse . Realizing your brother was infected and had to die because of it or realizing ... you have the same blood coursing through your veins ? I don 't appreciate your implication . - I 'm not that alien filth . - Not now . Maybe not ever . But that ... gene passes on and on . And on . Maybe even skips a generation , maybe not . But everyone that carries it is part of the plague . How dare you . I want you out of my office . Superior knows it 's not your fault . And you 'll play a role in this ... No , wait ! - ... no matter what happens . - Stop . Wait . [ Music ] [ Coughing ] [ Chuckles ] I 'm okay ... I 'm ... [ Gasps ] No . No ! Nooo ! [ Laughing ] You thought it was me ? [ Music ] Look at you . [ High-pitched whining ] You 're disgusting , you son of a ... [ Explosion ] Details are scarce , but it appears that Senator Ellen Nadeer 's office was ground zero in an explosion that looks deliberately set . Many are asking if Nadeer 's outspoken anti-Inhuman stance made her a target . Currently , there are no suspects , but the FBI is ... Is it possible ? - Could an Inhuman have done this ? - No way . They 've all been accounted for by me . We can 't account for the Inhumans that we don 't know about or the sympathizers . Come on , you guys . This is just another setup . Nadeer 's furious about the relocations , and she wants people riled up against Inhumans . Would Nadeer go so far as to bomb her own office ? Trust me , she 's gonna show up on the news having just missed the blast , and she 's gonna pin it all on S.H.I.E.L.D. - That 's what she does . - Daisy . We 're just getting confirmation from the FBI . We have four confirmed casualties and one positive identification . We are sad to confirm that Senator Ellen Nadeer , leader in the Humans First movement , is among the dead . Reporting live for CNB , we 'll send it back ... Okay . Well , we can 't be too sad . She did try to have you killed . She could 've been brought to justice . Now we won 't get that chance . But it 's not too late to do the right thing . Grab what you need . It 's time to show the world what S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for . So I 'll mark you down as shocked but not surprised , which is surprising . Well , Holden 's whole post-human work started with replacing body parts , so ... why not go for the whole shebang ? I can think of about a million reasons why not , but Radcliffe did it anyway . He called her Aida . And he could have made her look like anyone , - but he chose you . - Yeah , I got that part . Thanks . You said you didn 't work together . Were you special to him ? I thought so . But what I really was to him was the one thing he couldn 't quite fix . No matter what he tried , he always hit a brick wall . How we felt about each other didn 't matter . What mattered ... was that he couldn 't deal with failure . So he left me . - Ran , really . - What is it ? Glioblastoma multiforme . [ Chuckling ] I know , it 's boring . Just your garden variety brain tumor . But at least it 's in a really interesting place , - which makes it totally inoperable . - I 'm sorry . See , that 's why I 'm here . So I don 't have to hear that every day . [ sighs ] Anyway , thanks for ruining one of the few good days I have left . Finding out your nightmare ex has built a robot replacement of you is a lot to process , so ... I 'd appreciate it if you let me go . - I can 't let you do that . - Coulson ... We need to find Radcliffe , - and you 're gonna help us . - No , I 'm not . I 'm living out the rest of my life on my terms , and that means having nothing to do with Holden Radcliffe . I understand your situation , and I don 't want to make you cooperate , - but if I have to ... - I wake up and face death every day . You think I 'm scared of you ? I don 't know what you hope to accomplish by waltzing in here with that logo on your jackets , but it 's bad for all of us . Director Mace , are Inhumans behind this ? [ Music ] You said you wanted to show the world what S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for . Well , I was hoping to do that by solving this thing . We got this . So I guess now I 'm the team mascot . [ Indistinct shouting ] Coulson : We 've got an address . I 'm bringing her into custody . Then you 'll be doing it alone . Agnes gets us to Radcliffe . - Radcliffe gets us to May ... - She said she couldn 't help us . She said she wouldn 't . There 's a difference . This is a woman 's life ... the end of her life . Just give her some peace . - This is May we 're talking about . - Yes . May . The voice in your head telling you not to be reckless this time . I 'm not planning on punching a hole in the universe and releasing a demon into the world . Well , for Agnes , Radcliffe is the demon . Even if she agrees to reach out to him , we don 't know if Radcliffe has May . We don 't even know if May is still ... [ Music ] Go ahead . Finish that thought . Look , I know how hard it is to let go of someone you love . [ Music ] But there 's gonna come a time when you have to realize ... I 'm not giving up on May . When I was gone , she never gave up on me . So I 'm gonna make Agnes cooperate . You don 't need to be part of it . How am I not finding any trace of bomb-making material ? Probably the same way I 'm not finding any trace of accelerant . - Has to be something . - Clearly . And yet , there is nothing . So , we take a bit of everything and test a bit of everything , old-school . Like in the chem lab , at our old school . Guess who was seen entering Nadeer 's office right before the blast ? Cattle-prod enthusiast Tucker Shockley . He was with the Russians who took the Darkhold . And if memory serves , I quaked his ass . Senator Nadeer was also aligned with the Russians . - Why would they want her dead ? - Villain-on-villain violence ? If the Russians and Radcliffe have the Darkhold , they could have created a new , untraceable explosive . I really hate that book . However they did this , if Shockley 's not one of the three bodies in the morgue right now , he 's our bomber . We need to find him . How does a facial-recognition search in the city with the most surveillance cameras - on the planet sound ? - Like a good start . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Horns honking in distance ] [ Keypad beeping ] [ Buzzer ] [ Door closes ] - Thought you didn 't make it . - No . Almost didn 't . I ... I ... Unh ! I told you to bring her to me if she didn 't turn , not to set off a bomb and blow her to pieces . I released the Terrigen , like we planned . She turned . She became a husk , a thing . Then it exploded . Maybe the doc 's Terrigen was bad ! I don 't know . - How did you get out ? - I don 't remember . Give me a chance to prove myself . - I know that I can ... - How am I supposed to trust you ? [ Grunts ] You ... are my ... Superior . [ Music ] That 's all I wanted to hear . I leave the city now . You 've made it far too great a risk to even be in this country . We both know S.H.I.E.L.D. will come for you and try to take you down . And I will take them down with me . [ Music ] [ Music ] If you have to shoot , be precise . We don 't even know what these explosives look like . Got it . [ Devices beeping ] - Go ! Go , move ! - Stay down ! [ Groans ] [ Rumbling ] Hi . I was planning on coming down here , try to throw my weight around , force you to comply . I came up with some pretty good material , but I think the best place to start might be an apology . I know you don 't want to hear " I 'm sorry " anymore , so I apologize . Really , I do . Okay . Radcliffe took something from me , too . Her name is Melinda May . And she means everything to me . [ Music ] I wish there was another way . I 'm trying not to make it personal because ... May would hate that , but ... I can 't help it . It is . What do you mean he took her ? He kidnapped her . And then he replaced her . For weeks , we lived with an android imposter right next to us . I drank with her , chatting it up . She was spying on us on Radcliffe 's behalf . Once we figured out what he 'd done , he was gone . And I still don 't know ... what happened to May or if she 's even still ... Look , obviously , I 'm not his biggest fan , but I can 't believe Holden would do something like that . He 's all about ... healing , enhancing , prolonging life . It 's a lot to explain , but Dr. Radcliffe is under the influence of something dark and powerful . He is not the same man you knew . [ Music ] May 's like you . She 's brave , and she 's not afraid of death . But she deserves the chance to live what 's left of her life on her own terms . I know you can appreciate that . What do you need me to do ? [ Music ] [ Rumbling ] Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody . Hello , sweetheart . You 're lucky you 're with us and not the FBI . We have you on tape walking into the Senator 's office moments before the blast . What do you care ? That woman hated things like you . Were you following the Russians ' orders ? We know about Anton Ivanov . Why 'd he target Nadeer ? - Is the Director here ? - Did Radcliffe make the bomb ? You see , I 'm trying to help you . If you get us to Radcliffe , I can get you a deal . The only freak ... I 'll speak to is the Director . [ Both chuckle ] Okay . [ Rumbling ] Let 's try again now , shall we ? [ sighs ] Where ... is ... Radcliffe ? [ Beeping ] Aida , would you do something about that infernal buzzing ? ! Sir , it says you 've received an urgent alert from a post-humanist sub-group ? - Marked private . - No , it can 't be . [ Music ] [ Computer beeping ] No . This is ... This is fate . I need to leave immediately . You must perfect the Framework in my absence . It 's imperative . Doctor , you designed me to read social cues . You 're being evasive . [ Sighs ] How to explain ... Any robotic humanoid must avoid the appearance of being ... almost human . Even the slightest appearance of inauthenticity elicits a sense of revulsion . You mean avoiding the uncanny valley . Exactly . But ... [ Scoffs ] ... you don 't look at all uncanny . In fact ... you look entirely authentic . Familiar , even . - I 'm not unique ? - Aida , you 're absolutely unique . It was just ... good science to model you on someone ... real . - Someone you were close to . - Yes . Now she needs my help . [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Sighs ] Damn . Got hydrocarbons up the wazoo , but not a single oxidizing agent that would cause an explosion . - No nitro-methane ? - No . Sulphonic acid ? No , just carbon , nitrogen , phosphorous ... Wait , wait , wait , wait . - Did you find selenium ? - How did you know ? Jemma , you didn 't find pieces of bomb casing in that office . - You found pieces of Inhuman husk . - Inhuman husk ! Fitz , you 're brilliant ! Well , we both said it at the same time . So that means that somebody in that office went through a Terrigenesis . - And then what , just exploded ? - We 've seen worse . Big question is , how did Shockley ... survive it ? [ Scoffs ] Bloody hell . If this guy wants to talk to me , then why not ? We could try out one of my other superpowers . [ Music ] Persuasion . Hoo ! Quake , Director Mace . You two might be the most famous Inhumans in the world . Forgive me , fellas . [ High-pitched whining ] - Get away from him ! - He 's the bomb ! Move ! [ Whining continues ] [ Rumbling ] [ Thud ] [ Grunts ] [ Music ] - Hang on ! - Fitz ! [ All grunting ] [ Whining continues ] [ Beeps ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Is everybody okay ? ! - Don 't do that ! - What , help save the day ? No , do that . Just don 't risk your life when you 're doing it ! You could 've been blown to bits . [ Music ] [ Sighs ] [ Wind whistling ] [ Music ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] Whoo ! Well ... that was fun . [ Tires screech ] Hey ! You been in some sort of accident , mister ? Uh ... yeah . I 'd be real grateful if you could give me a ride . What happened to your clothes ? [ Music ] This is why I need to be at full strength at all times . If I 'd been powered up , none of this would 've happened . It 's okay . We got him out . I mean , it wasn 't pretty , but no one died . Except for maybe Shockley , but I 'm fine with that . Agent Johnson , I fumbled the ball . There 's no excusing that . All right , pay attention . [ Beeping ] [ High-pitched whining ] [ Volume increases ] Aah ! What is that ? It 's a high-pitch frequency caused by Shockley 's cellular vibration . The ramping up of his kinetic energy at an atomic level , and once it reaches a critical threshold , that massive energy transforms his body from a solid to a flammable gaseous state and then ... - Boom . - How he re-constitutes ... who knows ? But it 's likely that he 's still alive somewhere . All right , so we know he can control it , but how do we control him ? [ Music ] Wh ... You guys know that I can 't ... Yeah , well , you did absorb tremors in Los Angeles . Yeah . Yeah , but this would be a counter-vibration . It 's not the same thing . I can 't just ... [ Music ] - I can try . - Excellent . Now we just need to devise a way to contain him . However we do it , we need to do it fast . Shockley is now the perfect weapon ... an undetectable suicide bomber who gets to walk away . Just imagine the damage he could do . [ Indistinct conversations ] If he hasn 't shown up by now , he 's not going to . Trust me . I know him . He hates confrontation . We 've got to give him a chance . - Why ? - Okay . Don 't give him a chance . Give one to Melinda May . Even though she would 've stormed off 20 minutes ago . [ Chuckles ] I like this woman . - I 'll wait a little longer . - Thank you . For you . [ Cellphone rings ] I knew Holden was too much of a coward to show his face . Coulson : Answer it . We can see and hear everything . You 're not alone . Radcliffe : Agnes , please , listen ... Hello , Holden . This is not what I had in mind . I 'm sorry for all the precautions , but I have to be careful . There are people after me , you see . I-I-I 've made some scientific breakthroughs as of late , and not everyone agrees with my methods , so ... Holden , stop . I asked you to meet me because I wanted closure , but if you don 't have the guts to face me ... I 'm done . Agnes , none of that matters right now . I 've done it . I can save you . - I 've heard this before . - This time , it 's true . I said I would save you . Let me keep my promise . Please , just follow my instructions . Get up from the table and start walking south . He can see her . He 's here . Agnes , do what he says . Try to keep him on the phone . [ Music ] [ Country music playing ] - I need your phone . - Oh , sure . [ Dialing ] [ Ringing ] The Superior : Who is this ? I have a confession to make . You won 't want to hear it any more than I want to say it , - but I have to . - Mr. Shockley . And how did you escape S.H.I.E.L.D. custody ? The Terrigen . It didn 't turn Nadeer into one of those monsters . It made me one . I caused the explosion . You 're Inhuman . There 's no confession that can absolve you of this . I am a soldier . In a war to protect humanity . I can still be that soldier . You still have my attention . The plan hasn 't changed . I will deliver S.H.I.E.L.D. to you . [ Sighs ] - Anything else I can do for you ? - Yeah . Run . [ High-pitched whining ] [ Sighs ] Frak . Perhaps you 're not finding the right counter-vibration . - [ Sighs ] I 'm trying . - Yeah . And we 'll keep trying until you can defuse Mr. Shockley . Again ? [ High-pitched whining ] [ Rumbling ] Are you kidding me ? [ Sighs ] Scrimmage is over . It 's game time . Shockley just blew up a motel . We have to assume he 's only getting started . Bomb squad 's meeting us on the ground . You ready ? [ Music ] Do you remember my Degas print ? Radcliffe : Yes , of course . You knew I loved that print . You told me that when I was cured , - you 'd buy me the real thing . - I remember . I want you to know the day you left me , I threw that print in the bin . I couldn 't look at it anymore . Agnes , I hate myself for disappearing on you , but I never gave up . I just ... I 've realized I was going about it all wrong . Instead of trying to cure your tumor , I should have been trying to cure death itself . What does that even mean ? Turn left here . Go around the corner . [ Music ] Radcliffe : Come with me , Agnes , please . I can save you . You can live . Coulson : Hang in there , Agnes ! We 're on our way ! And how would you cure death ? - By making me into an android ? ! - No , I 'm done with robotics . This breakthrough I 've made is way beyond that . I call it the Framework . [ Chuckles ] I 've built a world where death is obsolete . You wouldn 't even be the first to experience it . I have a subject in the Framework right now , and she 's thriving . I can give you a full and happy life . That 's ... That 's all I 've ever wanted for you . [ Music ] Do not listen to him ! Keep him there ! [ Electricity crackles ] Radcliffe ! [ Music ] Get us out of here . We need cover . [ Tires screech ] [ Machine-gun fire ] [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Device beeps ] Simmons , you copy ? Copy . We 're about half a mile away . Okay . Well , hurry up . 'Cause if you recall , I haven 't actually been able to pull this off yet . [ Whistles ] Why don 't you come closer ? You scared ? Looks like Shockley 's back to his old self . Simmons : Really ? Incredible . He 's gone from an explosive gas to a fully functional ... Jackass ? Just consider the sheer amount of kinetic energy required to re-form . It 's remarkable . I 'm exhausted just thinking about it . " Exhausted . " - I can work with that . - What ... [ High-pitched whining ] Did you just explode Mr. Shockley ? Well , I thought if I can 't keep him together , I might as well blow him apart . [ Music ] [ Grunts ] [ Breathing heavily ] - Huh ... - Whoo ! Can 't kill me that way . If you wanted to get me naked , all you had to do was ... [ High-pitched whining ] [ Explosion in distance ] I thought Daisy was supposed to stop him from doing that . She 's going to wear him out instead . - We need to hurry . - I 'm good to go . [ Explosion in distance ] Shall we ? [ Vehicles approaching ] Those aren 't ours . - Who , then ? - The Russians . This is a trap . Shockley 's the bait . They 're here for us . [ Music ] See ? It 's pointless ! I 've already won ! I don 't have to kill you , just deliver you ! You and your stupid ... [ Rumbling , high-pitched whining ] [ Grunts ] Simmons , I can 't take this much longer . Sir , there 's an army coming our way . - Get in the car . - No . Mace : I think I figured out my place on the team . - I 'm the blocker . [ Chuckles ] - Go . [ Engine starts ] [ Music ] [ Inhales sharply ] [ Grunting ] [ Sighs ] [ Music ] [ Grunting , shouting ] I see that you are strong . [ Music ] But are you bulletproof ? Let those animals destroy each other . We have the Inhuman Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. [ Music ] [ Electricity crackling ] Your friends aren 't coming to help you . You 're just another freak like me now . Give up . I would rather ... [ High-pitched whining ] ... blow us all to hell [ Music ] [ Tires screech ] [ Music ] Aida : Just one last step . You 're doing well . [ Computer beeping ] See ? Painless . Just as I promised . The worst is over . No one should have to go through what you have . Soon , you 'll never suffer again . [ Chuckles ] [ Music ] Are you ready for a better world ? [ Breathing heavily ] [ Music ] She made her choice . I don 't know what to say . I understand why she went with him . She saw a chance , no matter how slim and risky , and she took it . I would have . I know it 's not easy to let go . To let go ? Of May ? I 'm not letting go . [ Music ] You heard Radcliffe . He said he had a subject in the Framework , someone who was thriving . He was talking about May . [ Music ] She 's alive . Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . [ Music ] [ Monitors beeping ] There 's nothing we can do to sustain her in this life . [ Music ] [ Flatline ] It doesn 't matter . [ Computer beeps ] In the Framework , her consciousness will live forever . The body will always give up ... eventually . [ Music ]

And it was the most scared I 've ever been . And then I saw this church . And then I remember feeling safe . And then it made me think of you because that 's how you 've made me feel .

( GIRL CRYING ) Help me . Help me , please . I need to get out of here . Please . Please . Please help me . I just want to get home to my baby girl . - Hi . Thank you . - I 'll put it on your tab . Kel . Are you kidding me ? Come on , it 's our last night in this shit box . Let 's make the most of it . To your last night on the job . To my best friend . Miss . Hey . Can I get you another drink ' ? Yes , please . I love your shirt . Yeah . Sorry , did I say something wrong ? No , it 's just ... You remind me of the person who bought it for me . Someone special ? Yeah . Shh . We 're celebrating . What are we celebrating ? It 's my last night on the job . I 'm getting out there to discover the world . But inside . I 'm kind of freaking out . What are you afraid of ? I don 't know . That I might go out there and fall flat on my face . Well , you don 't know unless you try , right ? You 're right . I just wish I was as brave as my friend thinks I am . Look , being brave doesn 't mean you 're not afraid , okay ? It just means you 're not gonna let the fear stop you from doing what you want to do . Kelly , come on . Come on . Hey , we 're about to finish up here . Um ... Do you want to come grab a drink with us ? I would love to . But I 'm sorry . I just ... I can 't tonight . Oh , I really like your shirt , by the way . To my road trip . Cheers . To you , honey . Go . So ... Who was that guy you were talking to at the bar ' ? What guy ? Really ? What guy ? Uh , I don 't know . Let me think . Someone over there . Oh , shit . You saw that ?

Tell Rainer I want them both back in service by tomorrow night . You know , that 's a two-day turnaround . We have a hedge fund team flying in from New York . Jesus . I hate when they do that . Bet you never saw anything like this in grad school . It looks so real . - That 's because their flesh , their skin . Most of their internal organs are real . Made from genetically cloned human tissue , There 's more of her living than not . Can they hear us ? - Technically they can . They just don 't have muscle control until I switch it back on . They look and act like humans . They even have real emotions . But at the end of the day . They 're still just artificials . They believe they 're every bit as human as we are . - It makes their reactions genuine , which gives our clients the most realistic experience possible . As far as Kelly there is concerned . That of a bartender in a lively night spot . This is her last night . Why her last night ' ? It puts her in a festive . Celebratory mood . It 's fun for the clients . - No detail has been spared . Well , I 'll say that illusion has been shattered . Only temporarily . The identity bracelets aren 't just there to distinguish residents from clients . They send a pulse every night , which erases the last 24 hours from their memory . The artificials live their lives in a continuous loop , repeating the same day over and over again . So tomorrow . When she wakes up ... - It 'll be . - Like it never happened . Kelly . Wake up . Kelly . It 's time to wake up . You made me breakfast . It 's your last day . I want it to be perfect . ( POLICE RADIO CHATTER ) You didn 't have proper authorization to go in there . I had a warrant . Is that not authorization ? Look , you know as well as I do that you could have got him upon exit . But no , you had to go in there and cause a big scene . Julian Michaels and that resort provides half the tax revenue that keeps this city going , And in return ... In return we show him a little cooperation . Come on , Roy . This isn 't the first time . What is it with you and that place ? They 're not real people in there . Here . Here 's a real person for you right there . That 's the girl that Hollister raped and murdered after hanging out in that place You know , people go in there , they get their freak on . They do whatever they do , And then they keep going in there , and then they bring that shit out in the real world . It feels normal to them . You know ' ? And who gets to clean it up . Huh ? We used to be cops . I 'm a garbage collector . I used to be a cop . I 'm not a cop anymore . I 'm a fucking garbage collector since that fucking place opened up . It needs to be shutdown . Don 't go in there , Roy . You go in there . I can 't protect you . I 'm tired of covering for you . How much are they paying you ' ? Kel . Really ? - You gotta be kidding me . - Come on . It 's your last night in this shit box . Let 's make the most of it . To your last night on the job . To my best friend . Come on , girl . That 's the spirit . Kelly ? Come on . Kelly ? Kelly , are you all right ? What the hell ? Sir . What 've you got ? 6126 ... she 's showing irregular cortical activity . Looks like she 's bleeding through from some unallocated memory banks . She 's experiencing flashbacks ? I 've never seen anything like this . Neither has she . What 's that . Bitch ? Somebody call a doctor ! - Reboot her . - She 's in population . - Reboot the entire grid , - All right . Packet sent , 6126 . - How many in the area ? - 37 . I want this face to be the last thing you remember before you die . She 's not receiving . Pick her up . - Why would you put the rings . - On a caged bird ? WOMAN : I 'm so over this costume bullshit . It 's all just role-playing . Gotta help sell the fantasy , right ? WOMAN : They should just install on / off switches on these things . Get off me ! Don 't worry , sweetheart . You 'll be back on your knees before you know it . We 've got a live one . Strap her in . Come on . Sit down . You 'll be okay . I 've got her from here . I know you must be confused and scared . But trust me ... We 'll have everything back in working order . Here we go . Are you a doctor ? I 'm an engineer . Close your eyes for a second , The flashes you 've been experiencing ... Those are little snippets of memory ... Memories which were supposed to be erased . You see . When you delete something from a computer , it doesn 't actually destroy the information . It just removes your ability to access it . Take a look for yourself . In order to figure out what 's going wrong here , I have to restore all of your memories and erase them one by one . I 'm not gonna lie to you . This is gonna hurt like hell . - No . - Come here . Get off me ! Stop . Stop . Oh , the life you 've lived . No ! No ! - Stop . - Easy . - Make it stop . - Easy . - Take her with you . - What 's going on ? - Now , go . - Wait , what 's going on ' ? Stop it . ALARM SOUNDING Hey , stop right there . Freeze ! ( MUSIC ) Stop right there . ( MUSIC ) Stay on her . Move it . Move it . ( MUSIC ) Give me a head count on non-residents . POLICEMAN : Folks , please get to holding . This way , please . Thank you . Someone will tell you what 's going on there . This way , please . Victims' holding is that way . Roy . What are you doing here ' ? I thought the captain told you to steer clear . ROY : I heard this place was gonna blow . I didn 't want to miss it . A cigarette ? No , pal . You know I quit . Don 't bust my balls . Glorioso . Come on , get these people to holding . - I got it . - What 's going on ? We 're thinking some kind of bomb ripped through the gas lines along the exterior of the resort here . - Yeah ? - A chain reaction . Most likely religious extremists . ( RADIO ) Unit 216 . What 's your status ' ? Sure it wasn 't some guy , some asshole paid for the fantasy of blowing this fucking place to the ground ? Hey , we got eyes on Julian Michaels ? From what I hear . He 's still at the helm . Get me clearance . Will you ? I 'm going in . - You shitting me , right ' ? Come on , Roy . Get back to work . Don 't let me stop you . He 's gonna be the death of me . 6126 cannot be detected 'till the system is back online . If the word gets out that one of our people is out there on the streets ... An artificial killing people .. - Understood . Detective Tedeschi is here . JULIAN : Just stick to the story . Detective . Roy . - Julian . - Julian Michaels . Correct . Somebody blew a hole in your little hole in the wall here . Well , I 'm sure you 're aware that the fundamentalists have been threatening to attack this building for quite some time . Yeah . I can 't figure out how they 'd get away with something like that though , with all the security and the cameras you got here . I mean , look at all these monitors . You know , I have some friends in the police department who let me know that you 're not very happy with what we do here at my corporation . Oh , no . I love it here . You know why ' ? This is the only place I know that any scumbag in the world can get into paradise . The only problem is they have to come through my city to get into yours . You would think that if you created a place where people could come and they could ... They could commit any crime they could think of . Just any fucked up thing that comes into their head . They could get it out of their system and they 'd become better citizens , you know ? But you know what ? Turns out . These people get a taste and they just can 't get enough . It 's pretty cool , isn 't it , Roy ? Can I take a look at your crime scene ? My men are already in there . Working on the scene now . I wouldn 't want anything to ... What 's the word you use in your business when you mess something up ? - Contaminate ? - Contaminate . We wouldn 't want you to contaminate the crime scene , all right ? But I really do appreciate you coming by . My guys will handle it . - I 'll be seeing you ... - Yeah . Julian . Thanks , Roy . ( PA ANNOUNCEMENT ) The time is now 11 : 45 P.M. Curfew will be enforced . .. In 15 minutes . All citizens are to get off the streets ... The time is now 11 : 45 P.M. Curfew will be enforced . .. The second pass tonight . Whenever there 's an attack on that place ... Martial law . I 've never liked that place anyway . ( BARTENDER ) Like you could afford to be inside , Hell , you don 't know of anybody who 's ever been in there . Like you do . Excuse me , sir . I could really use a drink . I 'll take that one , Paulie . Make it two vodkas . Looks like you 've had a rough ride . Here you go , Romeo . Now what else can I help you with ? You know , I think it would be better for both of us if you just leave me alone . Well , that 's not how it works , See , around here . When a man ... Excuse me . Sir . Can you turn that up . Please ? TV REPORTER : A move hailed by many as long overdue . However , Julian Michaels , CEO of Vice Industries , vowed that it would open in 24 hours . What do you say to critics who have long advocated for the closure of Vice ? JULIAN : Well , yeah , you could argue that some of the things that we do here could be considered criminal in the real world . But I would say that they 're missing the point . You see , that 's the hook . That 's why people come to this facility . It 's just pure entertainment . To experience a life completely outside the realms of possibility . And although we 've built the residents . They 're not flesh and blood like you and me . TV REPORTER : In the meantime , a bizarre sight in the wake of the closure ... A row of decommissioned residents . Their digital lives on hold . To our audience , we apologize ... ( PA ANNOUNCEMENT ) Curfew is now in effect . Patrol has now begun , Patrol ... Hey ! Where are you going ? I told you , I 'm not interested . Well . That drink wasn 't free . Will you just please leave me alone ? I will , when I get what I want . Get off me ! Kelly . Kelly . I know you 're afraid . I know you feel lost and alone . But you need to come with me . For your safety and for safety of those around you . Who are you ? I 'm the only friend you have left . Hey , stop right there . I 'd recommend dropping that , if I were you . Kelly , listen to me . I 'm here to protect you from people like this ... People who will want to cause you harm . They 're not like us . What ? Kelly . It 's okay . Everything is gonna be just fine . Get her ! ( MUSIC ) Everyone on me . ( MUSIC ) Kelly . Kelly . This is your last chance to come with me . I promise you you won 't be harmed . Kelly . Kelly , I know why the caged bird sings ... When he beats his bars and would be free , It is not a Carol of joy nor glee but a prayer that stems from its heart 's deep core . Kelly . I know how the caged bird feels . You 're only gonna get deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole . And there are many ways to flush out a rabbit . Pick your targets . On my count . Five . Kelly . Four . Three . Two . Light it up . Hold ! Run , rabbit , run . There . ( MUSIC ) Kelly . ( MUSIC ) 6126 is back on the grid . Heading into the city . Have your team stay on the girl . The grid 's online . I need you here for full tactical support . Understood . Let 's move out . Come on . MATHEWS : Yes ! There he is . Better be good . I should have known they 'd put you on this . Here , they didn 't have that artificial shit you like . Yeah . Well . I like cancer . Tell me this isn 't just coffee . What do we got ? MATHEWS : It 's is a total fucking cluster . You 're gonna love it . A professional job gone awry . From what we 've pieced together . Our Vic here took a couple dozen rounds from multiple assailants while defending himself with this . A knife to a gunfight , huh ? You don 't know the half of it . Whoever these guys are . They have the latest in military hardware . It 's not magic . These shell casings ... Untraceable , not a single identifying mark . And the bullets themselves ... They shredded upon impact . You have an I.D. On this guy ? MATHEWS : Yeah . Keith Williams ... A great guy . A long list of priors . Nothing major ... Basic assault shit , a pair of drug offenses . We pulled a D.N.A , Swab from his fingernails . It 's gonna take a couple hours to process . No drugs ? Nothing on him ? No . You 'd bring out the stealth team for . Yeah , he wouldn 't be top of my list . ROY : This guy probably got caught in the crossfire . Detective . - Got something for you . - What you got ? A bartender around the corner says the victim followed some girl out of the bar just a few minutes before this thing went down . - You got a description ? - It 's spotty at best . Early 20s , blonde , a real looker apparently . She sounds dangerous . Get that digital guy and see if you can get a rendition , okay ? - All right . Copy that . - All right . All right , boss . Let 's get these bozos to work . Who 's got an estimate on the time of death over here ? ( MUSIC ) Hello . Hello . You 've come a long way . Wait a minute . I know you . You 're ... I 'm an old friend . We don 't have a lot of time . Give me your hand . I know you can 't see this now , so you 'll just have to trust me . - Hold still one second . - Wait , what are you doing ? Shh , shh , shh , shh . There we go . This is how they track you . How ? All of the residents like yourself have them installed . But you 've been programmed not to see them . Come with me . I want to show you something . This is the only sanctuary I could find this close to the city walls . People tend to avoid churches when they 're living their lives in a state of perpetual fantasy . My God . My wife , Michelle . No matter how many hours and days I spent trying to stop the spread of that disease ... There was nothing I could do to save her life . Why does she look exactly like me ? Because I designed you in her image . ROY : All right , Stace , I need you to pull up all the surveillance footage in the closed-circuit cameras that show the exterior of Vice . Has this been approved ? Need a hall pass , Stace ? Okay , detective . I want you to find that explosion that happened . Go back to 9 : 30 and scroll through . It should have happened at about 10 : 00 last night , right ? Copy that . This is a municipal system set up on one of our relay towers . Oh , yeah ? What 's a relay tower ? You know what a relay tower is . All right , let 's find the explosion now . Just scroll through it . There 's nothing there . What do you mean , there 's nothing there , Stace ? The image is everything . I want you to find it . Between 9 : 30 P.M. and midnight . It 's like the system went offline or rebooted . You mean , that 's what these little time codes are . In other words , somebody hacked into the system and deleted everything . Well , that 's not possible unless they had access to the root database . Roy , I gave you strict orders that you 're not authorized to go anywhere near that facility . And then I find out from the officer in charge that you entered that facility without approval and questioned Julian Michaels ? I don 't know . It wasn 't really a questioning . I think it was more like a conversation . - Give us a moment , please . - Sure . Yeah , thanks , Stacey . All right . Oh , here , you forgot your cookie . You want it ? I want it . Was I not clear ? Yeah , but check this out . Don 't you think it 's a little odd that the most well-guarded facility in the Western hemisphere has no surveillance footage of the exterior of the building between 9 : 30 and midnight the night of the explosion ? Check it out . There 's a missing piece . It 's like ... It just like disappears ... Poof ! It 's gone . It 's missing . Huh ? All right , I 've had about enough of this shit . - I 've had enough off this fucking shit . - Right . You were assigned to a homicide case on the West Side . So what the hell are you doing , looking at stuff that doesn 't concern you ? Um ... Defending the greater good ? You 're a good cop , Roy . But you 're one step away from losing your badge . Oh , look . It 's right here . Any time you want it , cap , come and get it . Come and get it . ( MUSIC ) Roy , I 've got something for you . Yeah , talk to me . Got the results back on the D.N.A. Swab off the victim of the alley shooting . The bartender was right . We 're looking for a girl in her early 20s . The bad news is she 's already dead . Already dead ? I don 't get it . Michelle Lund , died nearly five years ago of cancer . Got a history on her ? I got you an old address for a next of kin ... Evan Lund . - Send it to me . - All right . Here you go . Thank you . ( MUSIC ) KELLY : How did all this come about ? When we first introduced the technology . The people panicked . It was just too real . They could never allow you into the real world . So they passed a law banning all A.I. Then how did I end up where I did ' ? I started building you as a side project . I didn 't have any kind of plan . I just wanted to spend another five minutes with the woman that I loved . And Vice ? Julian Michaels ... This guy ... he somehow talks his way into getting a special license to operate artificials in the strictly controlled confines of Vice . You gotta believe me , the second that I found out what his plan was . I tried to shut it down . Walk away . But he had a controlling interest in the company . So he seized everything , including you . And all my memories everything I feel ? Listen . You have real emotions . But they 're built on the fragments of someone else 's life . I don 't understand . The human experience ... It 's really the only thing that separates us from machine . So by limiting those experiences to a select few , Michaels is able to control the units ... Nurture versus nature . But you could have been so much more . So we had solid tracking on her position until she reached this point here . Then 6126 fell off the grid . It can 't happen . Charlie , let us have it . Did you check the presets ' ? Yeah . Take a look . That 's from her last day . She 's an artist . It 's part of her character shading . Yeah , that 's what I thought . But there 's no template for this particular image . Meaning she created it herself . That 's not possible . It 's a real temple . We cross-checked the location against our records and we got a hit . Her genetic designer lives there . Evan Lund . ( MUSIC ) I remember you . It wasn 't just the one time we saw each other . Really ? What 's in it ? It 's not bad . It 's not bad . I would like to see you again , Michelle , this place is perfect . You gotta see this . Come on . This might be hard for you to understand . But I lost the most important thing in the world to me . I know I was just torturing myself . But ... There were days when I would miss her so much , it would almost feel like I was drowning . And then I would come and see you and it was like , " okay , I can breathe again . " What are you doing ? You can 't be too safe . There 's a place where we can go . We can blend in , and no one would ever even know you existed . Where ? In the Caribbean . Called St. Helena . It 's a tech-free zone . How would we get there ? I know a guy who can hack us into the grid . Hello ! This is the police . Take this . My name is detective Roy Tedeschi . With Metro police . Is anybody here ? Hello ! How can I help you , detective ? Hi . Yeah , I 'm looking for a guy named Evan Lund . Sorry , there 's nobody here by that name . Well , maybe you can help me with something else . I 'm looking for a girl . She has blond hair . Very pretty , mid-20s . You think somebody like that would be here ? Sorry . This is a place of worship . Oh , is that right ' ? Huh . Anything else I can help you with ? You wouldn 't mind if I imprinted you before I left , would you ? Yeah , sure . Great . A routine imprint . - Oh , Yeah , that 's gotta sting like hell . Yeah , and let me tell you , pal . I had that fucker on the lowest setting . Okay ? So let 's not fuck around . Let 's not fuck ... I haven 't seen one of those since the academy . Now let 's be straight with each other . Where 's the fucking girl ? - I don 't know . - Don 't fuck with me , pal . Show me where the girl is . Where 's the fucking girl ? I don 't know what ... Get in the car . Down . Stay down . All right . Come on . It 's just up here . Wait a minute . What are we doing ? Just leave it . It 's the only way they can track us . It 's confirmed ... All three of our men are down . What about the girl ? Nothing on 6126 . We 'll track her the other way ... Microwave emissions . When artificials process fuel , they emit tiny amounts of microwave radiation ... Not much , but we should be able to detect it . We 've already drawn too much attention to ourselves . And now civilians have fallen into the line of fire . Collateral damage . When you look at the pyramids , you think about the pharaohs , but the pharaohs are all dead now . Fuck that . This facility is just the tip of the iceberg , A test bed for technology . Eventually people will get used to the idea . It 's for military . Law enforcement . The applications are endless . But not if we 're exposed . Send this out to your team . And stay on Tedeschi . He 's the one man that wants this as badly as we do . Understood . Give me that . Ever seen a bullet casing before ? It 's a 223 . Nobody goes up there but me . Get these bodies out of here . They 're starting to stink . Give me everything you have on Evan Lund . I 'm on it now . A mad scientist . Looks like our guy was some kind of bio-mechanical engineer . ROY : Yeah , and I 'm seeing it on my end . Worked for a robotics firm that was bought out by our friend Julian Michaels . Hmm . An interesting turn of events . I 've got some links here to some old military research he did back in the day on A.I. Send it to me . I 'm gonna upload an image of this girl to you now . Copy that . Where are you taking her ? KELLY : This is where your friend lives ? Yeah , just up here . KELLY : Evan , why are you doing this ? - Hey . - Evan . James . Good to see you again . - This is Kelly . - Kelly . Is this the girl you were telling me about ? Yeah . Now why would you want someone like that to disappear , hmm ? I thought you said you were a computer expert . Is that better ? A little bit , yeah . So what 's the deal ? Why is getting her out of here so important to you ? Well , she 's a ... a ... I 'm an artificial . Yeah . You 're serious ? Serious . Holy shit . You 're serious . You freaking stole one ? I didn 't steal her . James , don 't make it weird , okay ? This is just ... This is amazing . It 's ... I 'm glad you 're enjoying it . No . You don 't understand . You see . I 've ... I 've ... I 've never seen one this close before . I mean , not like this . Do you know what would happen if anyone got wind that she escaped ? Yes , that 's why we 're here . Her name is Kelly , okay ? Kelly . You ... You know what you are ? Mm-hmm . How does that feel ? I thought you said this guy was a genius . Only with computers . So are you gonna help us out ? James . Yes . Yes , I am . But I swear to God , Evan . This is the last time . After this , we 're square . Deal . You ... You follow me . I 'm so sorry . An artificial . Wow , James , I really like what you 've done with the place . It doesn 't look like much , but it gets the job done . A little trick of the trade ... You see . Most modern systems were built to leave behind a fingerprint . But these older models ... They can still hack into the grid without leaving behind the standard imprint . Okay , first things first ... Let 's get rid of the old Kelly . Model number ? 6126 . 6126 ... technical file , history , case maintenance , etcetera . Etcetera . Etcetera . Delete . Delete , delete . Delete . You are no more . Outside of the people that already know about you , you don 't exist . Now what ? I make you reappear . Your new name is Megan . No , Jennifer Washington . Passport renewed last January , cleared for travel . Where are we off to ? St. Helena . - Tech-free , huh ? - You know it . Okay , commercial flights ... Too much security . So we 've got charter flights . None available . Other vessels . Here we go . The Lady Anna , Departing to St. Helena tonight . I 'll backtrack the reservations so you can ' ! Be scrutinized . But your departure is 90 minutes out from pier 62 . Wow . - James . - Hmm ? They 've been tracking me too . Clear the slate ? Do it , yeah . Done . Kelly , we could give you an upgrade . An upgrade ? Yeah , we could download any skill set that you want . And you could do that ? Oh , yeah . If you wanted us to , yeah . No , I don 't . Suit yourself . Come with me ! The safest way to get you guys to the docks is with something that will blow out their thermal imaging . Nice . This ought to do it . I want this back . It 's nice to want things . - You know where to find it , - Yeah . ( MUSIC ) All right . We 're in position , standing by . Do you have eyes on the detective ? There . Right there . Tap us in . You 're telling me within an hour of running a search , everything we 've got on these two has been deleted from the system ? It 's like they never even existed . Hey , I want you to run these down to Matthews . Get it down there now . Okay , let 's try something else . Who 's been added to the system recently ? Come on , Roy . Those parameters could take days to track . Yeah . Well . Narrow it down . How ? I want you to look at St. Helena . I got a feeling about that . You still got that image I sent you ? Yeah , of course . All right . I want you to run an image capture using that image . She might be able to change her identity . But she sure as shit won 't change that face . All right ? Get back to me . We 've got movement on our primary . Slay on him . All right , Roy , I think we got a hit on our girl . You think or you know ? Well . There is a very close resemblance . Close ? That 's not good enough , pal . We only got one shot at this . Come on . All right , we 've got a cargo ship off the coast . It 's making a run to St. Helena . A passenger in the manifest looks like our girl . All right . Where ? She 's gonna be picked up at pier 62 in less than 20 minutes . You want backup on this ? No , I 'm gonna go it alone . And Matthews ... Nobody in the department knows I 'm there . Got me ? Yeah , man . I hear you . Okay , stay close to me . They should be here any minute . Are you okay ? What are you thinking about ? St. Helena . I 've never been to the ocean before . Not even in my memories . You 're gonna love it . Why ? Did Michelle ? No , because it 's the ocean . Everybody loves the ocean . You know . You could come with me if you want to . No . I can 't . You and I have both been living in an illusion . It 's time for us to go live in the real world . All right , lovebirds . Hey , hey , take it easy now . It 's a big gun . It 's a sig sauer . With a compressor on . In fact , why don 't you guys turn around ? Look , you don 't have to do this . She 's not gonna hurt anybody . I know , I know . You 're in love with a robot , but listen , the people who are after you are not gonna let you just walk away , pal . So what ? So she gets defragged , or worse . Reprogrammed , sent back to Vice as a cheap pleasure model ? Confirmation on 6126 . I 'll put her in protective custody like a real person , all right ? Till I can prove that real lives were lost . Then we 'll have a chance of taking this place down . Open your eyes . Detective . Just look at her . She 's evolving . She 's changing with each new experience . Then she 'll learn what it 's like to be in jail . Turn around . Get back . Get her down ! Evan . Shh . Shh . It 's okay . You can still go . You can still make the ship . No . No . No . I 'm not leaving you , Michelle . It 's not every day one gets to meet his maker . I 'm sorry . Look , the way I see it , you got two choices . Okay ? You can run . I won 't stop you . I know you didn 't kill anybody . Or you can come with me . Now if you really are more human than a machine , maybe there 's a way we can ... We can take down Vice once and for all . I need two things ... An upgrade and a reservation to Vice . I take it I 'll receive full immunity if you ever come calling again ? Why don 't we ... Let 's just make it one of them things that never really happened . That 's even better . Now this ... You interface this into the mainframe host , it 's gonna restore the memory of every artificial in that resort . Plug it in and hit the button ? Plug it in and hit the button . Do you have any idea what 's gonna happen when they start reliving their past ? I do . Washington . Jennifer and Steve . She 's Steve . I 'm Jenny . Have you guys stayed with us before ? We sure have . Well , in that case , unless you have any questions for me , you 're all set . Would you take this for me ? It 's not my brand . Sure thing . Give me 10 minutes and you 'll be all set . Okay , Steve . Sorry , ma 'am , this area 's off-limits . Whoa . Whoa . Ma 'am . Ma 'am . Easy . That 's a live weapon . I need you to put ... Boo . Look who 's come home . Welcome back , Kelly . You should have just let me go when you had the chance . Go ahead and shoot me . I 'll make it even easier . Just pull the trigger . Just a little pressure . I 'll come closer for you . It 's just a little failsafe that we had built in a long time ago . You see , that 's the one thing the original creators never considered ... Protecting man from machine . But only a select few of us are deemed important enough . Strap her in . Tomorrow everything will be just like the way it 's supposed to be . Proper order will be set . By the time you wake up from this little nap . You 'll be right back where you started from . Hey , I 'm looking ... For the control room . Do you have an access badge ? I 've got my badge right here , Hey , listen up ! Anybody who wants to live . Leave now ! Okay , okay , okay , okay . Except for you , pal . Sit down All right . You want to make it into bed tonight ? You 're going to do exactly what I tell you , okay ? I want you to take this . Upload it into the mainframe system here . I ... I can 't . I don 't have access . You got access now ? Okay , just ... Just hold on . There was a girl with a guy . Where did he take her ' ? - Engineering . - Engineering ? Where is that ? - Where is that , pa ' ? Point . - Third ... third floor . Jesus Christ . This can 't be right . Oh , it 's right , all right , Hit the button . Hit it . Make it ... ( ALARM SOUNDS ) Drop your weapon ! No . Wait . I 'm not one of them . They 're all self-aware . Did you consider a failsafe for that ? Shut it down . I can 't get in . It 's not letting me in . Yes , sir , we have officers en route . We 're doing the best we can , sir . Sir , sir , I 'm gonna need you to stay calm . Get the fuck out of the way ! We 've got confirmation from sources inside the resort all right ? There 's artificials going haywire . Jesus Christ , this is not happening . Yes , we have RE Units holding on the perimeter . Why are they holding ? 'Cause we got no authorization to go in there , captain . Son of a bitch . Alan Sykes , back on the scene . - Jesus , look at that . - Alan . Do you hear me ? Scramble the S.R.T. They 're still holding at pier 62 . Make it happen . I want every officer we have in the area diverted to that facility right now . I 'm on it . Oh , shit . You did it . You actually got in , you son of a bitch . It 's the end of the line for you . Now you know what it 's like to be one of your own victims . Get out of here , go ! Initiate the kill switches . Do it now , every single one of them . - I need more time . - Just fucking do it ! Freeze ! Don 't fucking even move . That 's right . All right , easy . Nobody else has to ... All right ! Not so good at following directions . Are you ? I said , don 't move . You think she 's gonna change ? Tomorrow all this is gonna be right back where it was . And there 's nothing that you can do to stop it . Nothing 's gonna change . None of this is gonna change . You blew up half the city trying to get this lime genie back in the bottle . It was always my city , Roy . Not anymore . Not bad for a robot . Oh my God . They did it . They freaking did it . The governor has asked all nonessential personnel to stay clear of the area . All civilians are advised ... ( MUSIC ) My God . What 's happening ? It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be fine . ( MUSIC ) Welcome to the real world .

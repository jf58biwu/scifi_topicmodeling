' s purpose if it 's not protecting us from the inhumans ? Why are human lives not S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s priority ? Actually , inhumans and humans share 99.8 % of the human genome . Inhumans are human , and the science is in agreement with me . In fact , we share 99.8 % of the human genome . It really is that close . I had no idea . It really is , George ... Genetics can 't explain the blackouts that plunged parts of the world into darkness . People were terrorized . Lives were lost . Two people died in a helicopter crash ... Let us never forget ... While 17 inhumans were murdered . That more inhumans than humans were lost during that crisis . And yet every day , there are reports of disturbances in hong kong or blue-skinned killers in Wyoming . Well , if I was to respond to every tabloid story and ... and ... And sasquatch sighting , I couldn 't do my job , which is to protect this great nation .

It 's a legacy I hope to build on . Treaties mean nothing to the inhumans . We 're dealing with something different here . Senator , when you say " different , " that sounds like a dog whistle aimed at hate groups . There 's no dog whistle needed , George . Just the word " inhuman " is frightening enough , and yet they choose to define themselves that way . See , that kind of comment , uh , illustrates the problem .

 Big jim : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , Forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons- - Rage ... Grief ... Fear . My god . ( people exclaiming ) Now , in order to survive , We must battle our most dangerous adversary ... The enemy within . Why do we need these amethysts ? They power the dome . If we bring the amethysts above ground , I 'm hoping we can recharge . Julia : Christine has some sort Of a schematic in her office . I don 't know what it 's for , but those amethysts Are definitely a part of it . You think you can plant the explosives And get out in time ? Yeah , not a problem . Guys , go ! My mom sacrificed Herself so that her child could live . You set off those bombs , didn 't you ? Christine : The actions of this resistance Have threatened our very survival . We need to kill them all . Julia : Really open to suggestions here . Joe : These seven geometric shapes on the schematic could be The amethysts that were in the tunnels . Julia : This is serious . We hit the kinship hard . They 're gonna come at us with everything they 've got . ( panting ) ( shushing ) Carolyn said that the amethysts were important To the kinship 's survival . That 's why christine wanted them dug up . I 'm not feeling great . Do you mind ? Of course . We got this . She 's taking carolyn 's death pretty hard . We all are . ( panting ) ( whispering ) : All right , one ... Two ... Three . All right , muzzles down . Anything ? ( panting ) Upstairs ? ( panting ) Where the hell are they ? Norrie 's not the only one creeped out We 're in a funeral home . This could mean anything . The only person who can tell us What this design means is christine . Torch the place . Julia : Hunter , Focus on cracking the password on christine 's recorder . Maybe we 'll find an answer there . ( static hisses over radio ) John to yoko . ( static ) George and ringo just torched the aktaion house . Looks like christine 's out for blood . We can figure out our next move when you get back . Yeah , copy that . What do you mean they weren 't there ? Well , they knew we were coming . My bet is they 're no longer on the island . They could be anywhere . Barbie : We 'll find ' em . Julia and jim will pay for what they did . Tell eva i 'll be home soon . ( yells angrily ) Oh ... ( gasping ) Oh , no . Oh , no , i 'm not ready yet . Christine ? ( gasps ) Christine , what is it ? What 's wrong ? It 's nothing . It 's nothing . Oh , here , let me help . Here . Oh . ( groans ) Let me see . Let me ... ( gasps ) Christine , what is this ? Christine : Remarkable . It 's happened . What are you doing ? ( pulsating tone ) You 're pregnant . ( sighs ) Hey . I 'm sorry about this place . Jim thought no one would ever look for us here . I get it . It 's just ... A lot . Norrie , if i 'd known that you and joe , or carolyn , Were down in those tunnels , i never ... It 's not your fault . It 's christine 's . And she 's to blame for all of this . I promise you , Your mother 's death won 't be in vain . ( crying ) : I didn 't want to leave her . She was in so much pain . But at least she didn 't die as one of those things . Because , even if it was just for a few minutes I had my mom back . If you need Anything , i 'm here , okay ? Okay . Julia ? If there 's any chance to get barbie back , The real barbie You have to take it . How is this possible ? We only slept together yesterday . You 're carrying the new queen . This isn 't any ordinary pregnancy . Barbie : Hey . What 's with the guards ? Everything okay ? I 'll leave you two alone . What 's happening ? Remember right before we woke up from the cocoon world ? Right . We were in the hospital . Yeah . You 're pregnant ? It 's a girl . Wow ! I mean ... Okay , okay . Christine 's certain , but i don 't ... Sit down . But what 's with the guards ? It 's a precaution . Big jim and julia- - they could be anywhere , And she might ... Listen to me . Nothing is going to happen to you or this baby . Understand me ? You leave julia to me . I still can 't figure it out . Happy to report all the bees are back in christine 's bonnet . Just don 't get too comfy . Eventually , We 're gonna have to move again . We 're at war . You said we 'd be safe here . Yeah , i did . I 'm also student of history , And , at war , always have an exit strategy . Hunter : Guys ... You got to hear this . You cracked the password ? So , i rewound to the beginning . ( recording rewinds ) this is christine 's first entry . Christine : It 's a shame we 'll never meet , But these recordings are meant to guide you , To help you and your parents , Barbie and eva , usher in a new generation- - The next kinship- - with you as its queen . Barbie and eva , they 're supposed to- - Have a baby ? That 's been christine 's plan from the start ? Junior : It was my idea To bring the amethyst here . It 'll be guarded at all times . Good work , james . We can 't afford to let anything happen to it . I just wish i could have stopped big jim . I 'll keep searching , i 'll find the resistance and kill them . Spare joe . But he 's just as guilty as the rest of them . With only one amethyst Remaining , adjustments will have to be made , And i need joe 's help . What about sam ? I went back to the bomb shelter . He wasn 't there . I gave sam a choice : He can either live among us , or ... Die with the resistance . ( groaning ) christine ? ( gasping ) I thought the cocoon healed you . It did . Where are you going ? The dome wall . I need to see it . You don 't have to be here , if you don 't want to be . No . Keeping my mind busy helps . What the hell is this thing supposed to be anyway ? I think these oscillating lines Are sound waves ? In that cocoon world , i learned how sound can be used as energy . I just don 't remember how . Ever hear of a library ? They 're filled with these things called books . You read ' em once in a while , And they tend to answer your questions . You want us to go to the library on a mission ? Well , if it keeps us one step ahead of christine , You 're damn straight . She said she had a way to bring the dome down . I didn 't , didn 't , i didn 't believe her . Seeing that thing , I think maybe she was telling the truth . We 'll get our stuff and go . Hey , listen , guys ... None of those bastards can know we 're here , you understand ? Yeah . ( sighs ) Anything ? I 'm writing everything down- - about halfway through . Safe to say , she 's not your biggest fan . Yeah , well , feeling 's mutual . ( sighs ) What ? Me- - i 'm in a wheelchair listening to a diary While people are trying to kill us . Not exactly pulling one 's weight . Look ... That recorder and then those aktaion files were coded , So that means they 're important . I couldn 't hack that . I 'm pretty sure julia , norrie And string bean couldn 't have , either . So , without you , we don 't know what christine knows . That 's pulling your weight . Thanks , man . I don 't get why everyone thinks you 're such a giant tool . Shut the hell up and feed my dog . Not too close to the window . I know . Every time i think this can 't get any worse , it does . Hmm . You know there 's still time to stop christine . No mommy , no daddy , no baby . You want to kill eva and barbie ? What part of " usher in a new generation " did you not understand ? No . Not while there 's still a way to save barbie . You mean the same barbie who just burned down a house Trying to find us ? That barbie ? There 's no way to reach barbie . Or my son . They 're just gone . Hunter , Carolyn- - they were taken over by the life force , But fought their way back . Yeah , i tried that emotion stuff with junior . It didn 't work . Maybe that 's because we were only half right . Norrie just told me That after the explosion hurt carolyn , she became human again . What if Physical pain suppresses the life force , Allowing emotion to overcome it ? What if you 're wrong ? We do it your way . I 'll drink to that . ( radio static hisses ) Barbie : Julia , you copy ? I 'm here . God , it is so good to hear your voice . What do you want ? I just want to see you . You have been right all along . There is something wrong with me . Eva 's really messing with my head . Meet me out by the soderquist farm . Just you and me . I 'll be there in an hour . Your gun ! Toss it in the woods . Hey , i 'm just here to talk . Do it , or i 'm gone . All right . I 'm here . Talk . Yesterday , when you asked me ... If i loved eva , I didn 't know what to say . I have not been able to get that question out of my head . And that 's when everything- - when you , Me , eva- - that all became clear . I realized That whatever i felt for her- - it isn 't real . Barbie ... Christine and eva were using me , And i am so , so sorry That i couldn 't see that . For not believing you . Oh , it 's really you . You 're back . I missed you so much . We have got to stop them . Christine is crazy . But i think i can get close enough to her to end this . Oh , i wish you hadn 't have done that . ( grunts ) ( gasping ) What did you do ? It 's for your own good . ( barbie pants , groans ) ( sighs ) Nice work , dexter . Help me get him back to the cabin . Christine : Oh , no . It 's begun . The dome 's surface is calcifying . Soon every living thing won 't be able to breathe Unless i can bring down the dome with joe 's help . I don 't understand . How is what 's happening To the dome making you weaker ? Because i 'm connected to it . And with the egg destroyed and one remaining amethyst , The dome has no power source . It 's shutting down . ( gasps ) Christine ? ( groans ) Christine ! ( groaning ) You recognize this place , don 't you ? Julia , what the hell ? It 's where you murdered my husband . Oh , come on . You got this all wrong . I 'm not like christine and eva anymore . Whatever was in me ... It 's gone , i swear . Well , that almost sounded convincing . Almost . Except for the knife hidden in your boot . What the hell is he doing here ? He 's gonna help me fight whatever 's inside of you . ( gasps ) It 's probably gonna hurt . Okay , julia . Come on . Think about what you 're doing . Please don 't do this ! ( panting ) ( barbie groaning , electrical buzzing ) ( barbie groans , gasps ) ( christine groans ) It 's okay . Let me see . Let me see . No , don 't . What can i do ? This . ( electrical buzzing , yelling ) ( groaning ) No . No more . Barbie ? Barbie , focus on my voice . Think about everything that we 've been through . I know you can fight this . Julia ... That 's it . That 's it . I 'm right here . ( laughing ) ( continues laughing ) I knew it . ( laughing ) I 'm sorry . ( laughing ) But the two of you , working together ... ( laughing ) ... That is priceless . ( coughing ) There 's just One problem ... With your whole plan here . You 've lost . ( panting ) I 'm part of the kinship now . ( panting ) And i 'm with eva . ( panting ) And nothing you do ... Is gonna change that . ( panting ) She 's having my baby . ( panting ) Oh , you two didn 't know ? Oh . Spoiler . ( laughing ) Though , in all fairness ... I just found out this morning . So , hey , go ahead , use your new pal here To torture me all you want , Because every time you do , All it does is remind me how much I don 't want you in my life anymore . What are you doing ? He 's right . It 's over . It 's too late . No . There is still time . Hey , jim , you wouldn 't happen To have any parenting tips ? Would you ? 'cause you did Such a great job with junior . Shut up . Why do you think He was the first one to fall in line with the kinship anyway ? ( grunts ) jim ! Junior 's weak . Or ... He saw you ... For what julia is now so willing To look past . ( panting ) : That you are A sad ... Pathetic ... Cold-blooded killer . ( grunts ) jim , that 's enough . ( coughs ) ( laughing ) What the hell are you doing ? The plan was to suppress the life force In barbie , not kill him . We 've been doing this for hours . He 's toying with us . You think i don 't see that ? He 's trying to pit us against each other . You really think he and eva got a cosmic bun in the oven ? Who knows anything anymore ? Well , this pain thing 's not working . Time to do things my way . No , i am not giving up on barbie . Hey , i know that i can do this , all right ? I just need to do it alone . And you 're willing to do Whatever it takes ? Just give me more time . Here . What 's this ? Back up . Indy wouldn 't let christine anywhere near him . If you can 't change barbie back , he 'll know . What are you gonna do ? Plan b . All right , it should be down here . What about The truth hertz , a fun guide to sound ? Even books with lame-ass titles could probably Tell us something about that sketch . So you think big jim is right- - That this is the way to take down the dome ? The military has devices that can immobilize armies Using sonar technology . So , yeah , i guess sound could be used as a weapon . But what if it 's not a weapon ? What if it 's , like , a beacon ? Kinship phone home . ( chuckles ) miller : What are you doing here , joe ? Get off me ! Seriously , get off me ! Come on ! Come on ! Joe ! Okay . Hurry , joe ! Got it ! I 've been looking for you two . Your wound . It 's almost healed . These human bodies and their oxytocin are a marvel . I 'm glad you 're feeling better . ( sighs ) James ... This is temporary . Everyone , everything has a cycle , And mine is coming to an end . No , but ... I thought you were my mate . What you and i have is beyond mating . But barbie and eva , they 're together . I figured that you and i ... Eva and barbie are special . And so are you , but in a different way . While they 're meant to be with each other , I 've always seen you ... With many mates . ( door rattling ) Sam , get out of our way now . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm on your side . Then where have you been ? I got captured . Christine experimented on me , but i 'm fine . If you go out that door , three millers are waiting for you . He 's right . The back stairs are your only chance . What 's it gonna be ? Let 's go . ( panting ) Where 's your better half ? Oh , i 'm not sure . Maybe he went to take a nap , a stroll . Maybe he went to kill eva . I didn 't ask him . ( panting ) You better stop him , julia . Big jim is big jim . A killer . But come to think of it , so are you . How many people have you killed ? No one that didn 't have it coming . Like your fellow soldiers ? 'cause seeing you like this , the reporter in me Really has to ask , Was it really friendly fire that killed them , Or were you just having a really bad day ? That 's low , julia ... ( panting ) ... Even for you . You ... Have no idea What i am capable of . ( buzzing , barbie groaning ) What about after the army ? Most guys go back to their lives , Go back to their families . You became a debt collector ... Killing anyone who didn 't pay up . So is that what the kinship wants you to be ? A killer ? What were my husband 's last words ? Did he beg for his life Before you shot him ? You know he wanted me to kill him . Or maybe you forced him To sign over those life insurance papers . Was that the plan this whole time ? Kill him , sleep with me , Then rob me blind ? And that would 've worked , too , but then the dome came down . Do you even hear yourself ? ( buzzing , groaning ) I know that you are in there , barbie . The real one . The man who doesn 't let his dark past Define the man he wants to be ! ( whimpering ) ( buzzing , crackling ) Eva , the kinship , They want you to be the man that you were . Not the man who owns his mistakes So that he can move past them And be a better man . That 's the man i fell in love with ! It 's simple , barbie : Eva is your past , And i 'm your future . So you fight for that future . You fight for me , And you fight for yourself ! ( sobbing quietly ) Can ... Can i please ... Have some water ? When dale returns from killing julia , Send him to my room . Slowly , slowly ... ( sighs ) Thank you . I need you to know , I never wanted it to come to this . Yeah ... I know . You always want to see the best in other people . And that 's just ... So ... Incredibly ... Massively ... Annoying . Who hooks up with the guy That kills her husband , anyway ? And you think that there 's something wrong with me ? I know this isn 't you . No , see , that 's where you 're wrong . The real me is the person that you refused to see The day that we met . And just like a good soldier , I knew exactly where to attack My enemy at her weakest . I 'm not the enemy . Caroline would disagree with you . That was an accident . On second thought , maybe you 're right . Because a good enemy actually puts up a fight . You were such easy pickings . You were naive , Vulnerable , so desperate for a man , For any man that would pay more attention to you Than the racetrack . What did you think was gonna happen If we ever did get out of the dome ? That you and i , Two people who couldn 't be any more different , Were what ? Were gonna live happily ever after ? That was never going to happen . Just face it , julia . You were nothing more than comfort food Until i got out of here . You 're wrong . You mourned me In the matrix . Uh-huh . I lied . ( wry chuckle ) Go ahead , do your worst . The restraints , The pain , You ... None of that matters . Nothing that you do Is gonna get me to leave eva 's side . Do you think that baby is gonna have her beautiful eyes ? This isn 't the kinship , julia . This is me . This is the real me . Whatever it was , That you thought was between us , It 's over . I ... Don 't ... Love you . ( gasps , grunts ) What about her ? Your mate needs to be in the prime of her fertility- - Healthy , strong ... Maternal . She 's perfect . Charlotte chastain . She was a junior when i was a senior . The younger ones i need . No , i want her . Fine , but you need to find me a suitable replacement . I need at least 12 girls . Have them waiting for me when i get back . Where are you going ? To say hello . Harriet . Hi . Oh . Oh , my goodness . Such a beautiful baby . Isn 't she ? Yeah . Where 's big jim and julia ? They left a while ago . Whoa ! No , hunter , it 's okay . Sam 's on our side . You finished with christine 's recorder ? Almost . I seriously needed a break from her voice , So i moved on to the aktaion files Lily sent . Who 's lily ? Long story . Hektor martin ? Longer story . Apparently , he 's the real head of aktaion . I thought barbie 's father was . Yeah , so did i . Turns out , this dude 's been secretly Running it the whole time . Why would he hide his involvement ? Maybe because , from what i can tell , The government has their hand so far up him , he 's a muppet . A rich , Powerful and very bad muppet . Come on , sam . I want to show you something . ( indy barking ) ( angry shout , indy continues barking ) Barbie ! Stop ! Julia ... ! ( grunts ) ( gasping ) ( growling ) Get off ! ( whimpers ) Have you heard from dale ? He 's been gone for hours . Christine : Eva , stop worrying . It 's not good for the baby . Who 's she ? This is harriet , your midwife . Why would i need a midwife ? I only found out i was pregnant today . Eva , i told you , This isn 't any ordinary pregnancy . Your baby will be here Before you know it . Now i need you to pack some things . We 're going somewhere your baby will receive The special care she deserves . I 'm not going anywhere until dale 's back . But don 't you want what 's best for your baby ? Of course i do . I promise you , This 'll only be for a short while . And when we return , barbie will be here And you can be with him for as long as you wish . Go to the barn . I 'll let eva shower and then bring her to you . Sam : I 'm sorry , joe , i have no idea what this is . Christine never talked about Building something that could bring down the dome ? This can bring down the dome ? I 'm not sure yet , but if these lines are sound waves , See how they 're all directed To this focal point where they 're expanding ? I would think that That focal point would have to be some sort of amplifier . Why would christine need to amplify sound inside the dome ? I was wondering that too . Until i realized That every single attempt to destroy the dome Has come from the outside . So what if the only way to bring it down comes from the inside ? Let me just find the page ... Sam , with the right frequency and amplitude , It 's possible that the dome could shatter , Like an opera singer breaking a glass with her voice . Let me just find it here ... Does christine know you have this ? I hope not . ( panting ) Oh ! ( grunts ) You know this is the part Where i tell you it gets better with time . When alice died , i was ... Angry . But with carolyn ... I 'm just sad . Then be sad . Just allow yourself to feel something . ( sniffs ) God , with everything that 's happened , I haven 't even asked how you 're doing . Sponge baths suck . I am sorry . If i hadn 't been on that roof when you came to find me , I just ... No , you never have to apologize To me , norrie calvert-hill . Besides , being paralyzed isn 't my long-term plan . I 'm getting out of here . There 's a girl in zenith i 'm gonna ask for a dance . Mmm . Just a dance ? For your information , everything down there still works , Thank you very much . ( laughs ) i didn 't need to know that , okay ? Come on . Let 's see if joe and sam have figured out that schematic . Where 's joe ? Yeah . Where 's sam ? What happened ? Joe ! Joe ! Joe , where are you ? ! ( shower running ) ( eva screams ) ( grunting ) How did you get inside town hall ? This my town ! How the hell did you know i was coming ? I could smell you from a mile away . Guess i 'm not the only one Who needed a shower , huh ? You made a mistake coming here alone , old man . I 'm fighting for two . Aah ! ( grunts ) That 's for calling me old . ( screams ) Are you hurt ? I 'm fine , i 'm fine . It was big jim . I stopped him . Whatever is happening to me , I am stronger . I 'm faster . It 's the baby . Come on , let big jim think he 's getting away . We can 't wait another minute To get you and your baby to safety . ( panting ) Barbie : Julia ! Don 't . We 've been waiting . Go ahead . They 'll take care of you . " they " ? What are they all here for ? Christine : Your child . The future queen . I told you i wanted charlotte . She came to me . Wanted to be a part of this . Don 't worry . I promise she won 't feel a thing . No one comes in or out . Red ! Indy ! I can 't find them anywhere . The schematic and the recorder are missing , too . Indy and julia are missing . What happened there ? Sam 's a part of the kinship and i think he took joe . Well , how the hell did he find us here ? We met him at the school And we thought he was still human . Grab everything you can . We need to get out of here . Now . Sam : Kyle . The rest are at coggins ' funeral home . Gather everyone you can and go there . Where are you taking him ? Christine . Uh , i 'll go get the car . Okay . Okay , i 'm gonna start loading . Son of a bitch ! They 're already here . We 're surrounded . Norrie . Then this is where we make our stand . ( sniffles ) You 're going to shoot me ? I will . Well , then , do it , julia . Come on , pull that trigger . Go on . Go on . Right here , pull that trigger . Julia ... Do it ! You should 've let me go . I love you . All i 've ever done Is love you , since the moment we met . If there is anything left Of the real barbie in there ... I 'm taking him with me to the grave . ( gasping ) Julia ? I 'm right here . Come back to me .

 [ dramatic music playing ] [ Shiro ] We 've gotta act fast . The power will only be down for 20 minutes . The Blade of Marmora 's schematics showed four targets we need to hit . The weapons systems , the engines , the bridge , and the shield generators . Now , let 's put an end to Zarkon , once and for all . [ all ] Yeah ! Form sword ! [ Zarkon ] I want weapons systems activated immediately ! Restart the entire crystal core manually if you have to ! Our ship may be without power , but we are not . I can use the komar to draw the quintessence directly from Voltron , rendering him lifeless . It is time I face Voltron myself . No , lord ! It is certain death ! Today , the Black Lion will be mine . Your obsession with the Black Lion is clouding your judgment ! You must not go out there ! Hurry ! We need to protect our emperor . [ Shiro ] Hit the engine systems ! [ grunts ] We 've done it . This is the end of Zarkon 's reign . Yes , Princess . [ alarm blaring ] Ready my armor . But , lord , it has never been successfully tested . To do- - [ screams , groans ] Begin the ritual ! [ Shiro ] Stay focused . We 've neutralized the engines . Let 's target the bridge . Ready ... [ Lance ] What is that ? Oh , no . Attack ! No ! [ all screaming ] [ moans ] It 's pure quintessence ! [ breathing heavily ] [ sighs ] [ Coran ] Paladins ! Can you hear me ? [ static ] I thought the virus shut down all of Zarkon 's power ! That blast was not from the ship 's weapons . - It was magic . - It must have been the komar . Zarkon has been trying to develop a device to extract the quintessence from planets . It appears he succeeded . [ Coran ] If it destroys planets , what did it do to the paladins ? [ Allura ] Paladins ! Shiro ! Can you hear me ? [ static ] [ Shiro ] Yes , Princess . We 're alive . - Oh , thank the ancients ! - Is Voltron operational ? It 's not working . [ grunts ] I can 't move my lion . You 've been hit with some kind of witchcraft that draws the quintessence out of you . You need to get out of there ! Another blast like that and you may not survive ! Wait . What 's that ? You must get moving . Remember your training . Remember all the battles you 've been through . [ grunts ] Voltron 's still not responding . [ groaning ] [ sighs ] It 's Zarkon . We must buy them more time . Get us in closer . - Divert all power to our weapons system . - What ? Princess , we 'll be defenseless ! It 's the only way . Listen to me . You are true paladins now . Connect with your lions , reach out to each other ! Fight ! This cannot end now ! Fire ! [ gasps , screams ] Allura ! Everybody , listen . We have to fight . We have to channel all our energy . Visualize five becoming one . We have to focus everything we have into moving Voltron . [ takes deep breath ] We are the last thing standing in the way of Zarkon 's total universal domination . I 'm not giving up that fight ! - Are you , Hunk ? - No . [ roars ] - Pidge ? - Never ! [ roars ] - Lance ? - Let 's go down swingin ' . [ roars ] - Keith ? - I 'm all in . [ roars ] Then let 's get Voltron back in this battle . Now , I will take back what is mine ! Summon the energy again ! We must fight beside our emperor ! [ Shiro ] All right , let 's hit him with the big guns . Hunk , form shoulder cannon ! Fire ! Attack ! [ Shiro ] Look out ! [ all scream ] Oh ... Huh ? Princess ! [ grunts ] Are you all right , Princess ? [ sighs ] I 'm fine . How badly is the Castle damaged ? [ alarm blaring ] Our power levels are decimated . Communications aren 't working . We can 't reach the paladins . I 'm afraid we can 't fight anymore . We cannot give up . [ grunting ] Did we win yet ? Coran , you and Slav do what you can to get the Castle functioning again . Kolivan , can you get me to the komar ? It will be dangerous , but I know a way . - You and Antok come with me . - [ both grunt ] We 're going to have to attack the witch directly if we hope to stop that thing . Coran , the bridge is yours . No ! You 've been weakened by operating the teludav . - You can 't face Haggar directly ! - We don 't have a choice . We 've never faced anything this powerful before . One way or another , this may be our last battle . We 've got to give everything we have . Dig deep and fight ! [ beeps ] [ screams ] [ grunting ] [ screams ] [ grunts ] [ growling ] Attack ! This is my time to reclaim the Black Lion . Nothing can stop me . [ grunting ] He 's trying to control my lion . I can feel him in my mind . Fight it , Shiro ! [ all yelling ] [ all screaming ] You should have fled like your predecessors . Now , the time of the Voltron Paladins is finished . [ Keith ] Shiro ! Shiro ! Something 's wrong with Shiro . Guys , we can 't let Zarkon get the Black Lion . [ grunting ] [ grunting ] [ grunting ] [ grunts ] [ groans ] [ grunts ] [ gasps ] [ grunting ] - [ grunts ] - [ grunts , screams ] [ groaning ] [ gasps ] [ screams ] Antok ! [ breathing heavily ] [ Pidge , faint ] Keep Zarkon away from the Black Lion ! [ Keith , faint ] Come on ! We can 't give up ! [ Hunk ] I 'm running out of strength , man . [ Lance ] Look out ! [ Keith screaming ] [ Pidge screaming ] - [ groaning ] - [ paladins grunting ] [ Keith screaming ] - [ Hunk screams ] - [ Pidge ] Hunk ! [ growling ] [ paladins grunting ] [ breathing heavily ] [ grunting ] [ roars ] [ gasps ] - [ breathing heavily ] - [ Lance ] Whoa ... What did you do ? I 've got Zarkon 's bayard . [ Keith ] You mean you 've got your bayard . [ Shiro ] We 've only got a few minutes left before power returns to Zarkon 's ship . Form Voltron ! [ roars ] [ both grunting ] [ grunting ] [ grunting ] [ panting ] [ grunting ] [ grunts ] [ grunts ] [ groaning ] [ groaning ] [ gasps ] You 're Altean ? [ yells ] [ grunting ] Impossible ! - [ yelling ] - [ grunting ] [ grunts , groans ] You will never destroy another innocent world ! [ grunts ] [ both grunting ] [ both grunting ] [ breathing heavily ] [ groans ] [ grunting , breathing heavily ] Come on ! [ beeping ] [ both gasp , scream ] We 're back ! [ laughs ] [ Coran ] Hello , paladins ! - Yeah ! - You 're alive ! Is everyone okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine ! Don 't worry , guys ! Oh , great . Slav made it . [ Coran ] The power on Zarkon 's ship is returning ! We need to get out of here ! I 'm going to get Allura ! This is our last chance ! Let 's finish this ! [ all grunting ] [ grunts ] [ grunting , screaming ] [ grunting ] [ beeping ] [ grunting ] [ all screaming ] [ screaming ] [ groans ] [ grunting ] Did we do it ? [ Hunk ] Is it over ? [ Coran ] I have Allura and Kolivan . We need to go ! [ gasps ] Shiro ! [ Pidge ] We need to tow him back onto the ship ! Princess , we 're all onboard . [ panting ] Shiro ! [ Keith ] Shiro ? [ Lance ] He 's gone . Summon Prince Lotor .

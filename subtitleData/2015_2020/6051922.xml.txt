Everybody move ! Take the level ! Go ! There 's a war council meeting happening tonight , And all the leaders are going to be there . We 're gonna use a missile .

[ wind whistling ] [ shouting ] [ shouting ] [ shouting ] [ people wailing ] [ horse neighing ] No . No . Clarke . I could have warned them . I could have saved them . If they see us , they 'll strike again . Victory stands on the back of sacrifice . You know that . I want the mountain men dead , All of them . [ people shouting ] We need bandages ! Abby : Right here . It 's no use . She 's still alive . We save those who can be saved . I 'm so sorry . Lincoln , be careful . It 's not stable . They 're down there . Yaagh ! Do you hear someone ?

He aimed the missile . He 's alone . Clarke , just slow down . If he is a spotter , he 's here to make sure we 're dead . If he tells the mountain were alive- - He won 't . How can you be sure ? Because i 'm gonna kill him . [ gunshot ] agh ! Man : Get down ! [ gunfire continues ] Nyko : Lincoln , you must stop the bleeding . Uh ! Indra , let me help you . No . What do we do ? No ! Agh !

[ clanging continues ] [ kane panting ] Ah ... [ clang ] [ clang ] Ooh ! Jasper , where do you want this ? Put it here , no weak spots . We need to make sure they don 't get in . They won 't . We took the level , but now we have to hold it . They will be coming , and we need to be ready . Harper , get some pots from the kitchen , Fill them with water , as big as you can find . Ok ? Watch out . Good , fox . Let 's go get those hallway cameras , all right ? Nope . Leave the hallway cameras . We 'll need eyes out there . You can do that ? Have you met me ? Where are we on the doors ? Elevators are all disabled . I shorted the other stairwell locks . This one is tricky , though . I can 't seem to- - That works , too . How long you think we can hold them off ? As long as we have to . I have to help them . [ gunfire ] I 've got to get down there . Now . Aargh ! [ gunshot ] [ panting ] Go , go . Come on . Let 's take it ! Come on ! [ gunfire ] Gah ! [ moaning ] Nyko : What are we gonna do ? We can 't move . I 'm going for the shooter . I 'll sound the horn when it 's done . All right , my friend . I 'm going with you . No . Nyko needs you here . Are you sure you 're up to this ? What can i do ? Pressure here . This is my village . You 're the chief second . Save our people . We 're pinned down , And the other seconds won 't follow me . So make them . Indra ? Oh ... She 's losing too much blood . Indra . We have to do something . Caris : Thanks , sky girl , but there 's nothing to do Until the sniper is dead . [ gunshots ] [ murmuring ] We are not ready for this . Yes , we are . Just follow the plan , we 'll be ok ... I promise . Monty : No guns . You were right . It 's because they can 't kill us , Not like this , anyway . Be careful with that thing . We 're in close . You could hit one of us . Monty : Wait a second . Some of them aren 't wearing hazmat suits . What 's it mean ? Means they 're cured . Marrow treatments worked . [ rattling ] Get this down . Get ready . Get it open ! Let 's do it . We got it . Alpha team , go . Take it down . Man : Go , go , go . Now ! Yaah ! Retreat ! Retreat . Pull back . Pull back now . Raah ! We did it ! [ all cheer ] Seal the barricade !

We just need someplace safe to stay . They need to go now . Let me explain . How about you explain where he got that uniform ? Maya , you know how dangerous this is . What are you doing ? What mom would 've done . I need you to leave . Sorry . We can 't do that . That 's ok . He 's gonna help us . Really ? Because i 'm not getting that . My parents were part of a movement That was against using outsider blood . My mom refused the treatments , and it killed her . She was willing to die for what she believed in . Maya , you were 5 . I couldn 't leave you alone . Not a little girl anymore . They were willing to kill you before . If you get caught- - We won 't if you help us . Fox : Please . They 're killing us . We don 't have anywhere else to go . Just this once , just for one night . My room is this way . Thank you . You know they 'll never stop , right ? If the rumors are true and your bone marrow Can get us back to the ground , They 'll never stop . It 'll be light soon . We won 't have the darkness to hide us . Neither will he . I feel your anger , clarke . Do me a favor- - no more lessons . You need to focus . We do what we must to survive . The enemy does the same . It 's not personal . It is to me . You think that killing the shooter Will make you feel better , but it won 't . The only thing that will do that Is winning this war . That 's enough . [ crack ] Is it him ? No . Lincoln . Clarke ? Commander , wh ... Octavia said you were both- - You 've seen octavia ? Yeah . The few that survived the explosion Are being pinned down by a sniper . That 's why i 'm here . [ distant gunshots ] Come on . We need to get to the high ground . G 'uh ! [ creaking ] Uh ! [ coughs ] Uh ! Nngh ! Don 't move . Don 't move . [ squirt ] yaagh ! Your femoral artery is lacerated . The weight of the beam , It 's the only thing keeping you alive . Ha ! Hell of a bandage . Ohh ... I 'll figure it out . [ rumbling ] Abby , just ... Go find your daughter . If i can get a tourniquet around your leg , It buys us more time . Go find clarke . She 's not here . [ distant explosion ] She 's ... Fine . Lexa , too . [ rumbling ] Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Lovejoy 's key card will get you into the armory . The guns are locked , but the guard has the key . I can lure him away or- - No . There 's no time . Once i get the guns , how do i get them to level 5 ? They 're watching every door . Maybe not . The mess hall has a trash chute . A trash chute ? There 's one on every level . Best part--no radiation alarms . The hatches leak like crazy . So they put in these airlocks Just to be safe . You get the guns , I 'll get them into the mess hall . You 're a natural-born revolutionary . My mom was the revolutionary . I 'm just trying to do what 's right . Be back here in 30 minutes . Cage : Maya , we were just on our way to see you . How can i help you , mr . President ? [ beep ] They 're gonna come in a lot hotter next time . You know that , right ? All we got to do is hold the floor Until bellamy finds a way out . We 're gonna need more than a bucket of water And 4 guns to do that . [ beep ] Cage , on radio : This is president wallace Talking to the people who just killed 10 of my men . Monty : Jasper . Cage : I thought we 'd try something A little different this time . There 's only 20 minutes of oxygen in maya 's suit . I know she 's a friend of yours . 20 minutes , your friend will either suffocate or burn ... But you can save her . All you have to do is surrender . [ gunshot ] [ gunshots ] We can 't wait anymore . Our people are dying down there . [ woman panting ] If we can get to the crater , We can tunnel in from the side . There 's no cover . I 'll do it . [ gunshots ] Get back . Agh ! Caris : Any other bad ideas ? Ahh . Just one . Unh ! Unh ! [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] Now what , sky girl ? Now we dig . Stay down . Stay down . Stay down . Move it . [ both grunting ] Hey , you 're ok . Listen to me . Fox is ok . Bellamy saved her . He 's gonna get some guns in here through the trash chute . If we can get guns in , we can get you out . Monty : No . We can 't . I dismantled the chute . I 'm sorry . I didn 't think we 'd be trying to open it ourselves . I can fix it . Thank you . Go help him . Harper ... [ sobbing quietly ] I won 't let you die . I won 't let you surrender . Uh ! Mm ... Ah ... Uh ... Uh ! Uh ... Ungh ! Marcus ? [ distant clatter ] Uh ! Marcus , marcus , wake up . Open your eyes . You have to wake up . Marcus , open your eyes . Oh , i 'm so cold . I 'm right here . I 'm right here . I 'm ok . I 'm sorry , marcus . I 'm so sorry . It 's not your fault , abby . It is my fault . She 's my daughter . What are you talking about ? She knew . Clarke escaped ... Before the attack . She knew it was coming . Yes . Oh ... How could she do something like this ? Because she grew up on the ark . She learned what to do from us . She let this happen . She could 've stopped it . She made a choice , Like executing people for stealing Medicine and food ... Like sucking the air From the lungs of 300 parents So they could save their children . Like floating the man you love ... To save your people . Yes . We have to answer For our sins , abby . After everything we 've done , Do we even deserve to survive ? Harper : She 's almost out of oxygen . It 's been 19 minutes . You 're not helping , harper . Don 't worry . We 'll get it open , won 't we , monty ? Almost there . Almost isn 't good enough . I just need to bypass the--oh ! Screw this . What the hell did you do ? Cut the power to the motor . Help me . Monty : We can 't get leverage . Harper : There 's someone in there . They 're coming in ! Monty : Bellamy . Get her in here . Come on . Come on ! Go , go , go ! Bellamy : Hurry up . [ buzz buzz ] [ buzz buzz ] Uh ! Uh ! [ gasping ] I got you . Voice : Decontamination complete . All clear . [ panting ] [ door opens ] Dad , what are you doing here ? What your mother would have done . Come here . Ha ha ha ! Uh ! Hey , listen to me . Clarke is coming with an army of grounders . What ? We have to keep all of you safe until then . And don 't tell me finn finally Got his peace talks . Something like that . Come on . We got a lot of work to do . [ gunshots ] So much for the element of surprise . I 'll draw his fire . No . I will . [ gunfire ] [ gunfire stops ] [ panting ] Aagh ! Hrrgh ! [ high-pitched tone ] [ tone stops ] Uh ! Ah ! Drop the weapon . Gah ! Just let him kill me , then take him out . Go on , clarke . Please . You people need you . You are my people . Ah ... [ coughs ] Uhh ! Uh ... Good shot . Did that make you feel better ? No . Ugh ! Uh ! Caris : Oh ! Aagh ! Uh ! It 's no use . Come on ! We can do this . [ horn blowing ] Wait . Listen . [ horn continues ] Lincoln . He did it . We still can 't get them out . Want to bet ? Get back in there . It 's been 30 minutes . So the girl is dead by now . I know that , lieutenant . They 've made their choice . Go in strong . Take them alive if you can , but take them . Copy that . Throwing flashbangs . Fire in the hole . Let 's go ! Go ! [ slam ] [ door opens ] Emerson : Mr. President ... Find them . It 's all clear . Won 't they see us ? Relax . Maya took out the cameras . Miller : Yeah , well , we 're still sitting ducks In a group like this . You 're right . So we 're gonna split up . No . We do this together . We survive together . Bellamy 's right . Miller : Well , they don 't trust maya anymore . Who the hell is gonna help us now ? They are . We 're going to hide you . Not everyone here agrees with cage , Not by a long shot . Come with , me . We 'll divide you along the way . Let 's go . Bellamy : It 'll be ok . Vincent : Let 's go . You 're safe now . Quick , quick . Go this way . That way . Go . Find your people . Find your people . Go . Hey , we 're coming with you . No , you 're not . They still don 't know i 'm here , And i need to keep it that way . So what do we do ? Stay alive . Be ready to fight . War is coming . Marcus ... Marcus , marcus , wake up . Marcus , wake up . Wake up ! Uh ! Nngh ! Aah ! Uh ... Hold on . Hold on . Hold on . Caris : It 's still not working ! [ horn blowing ] Woman : Sky people !

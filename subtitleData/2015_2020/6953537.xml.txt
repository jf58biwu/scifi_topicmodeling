We 've made inquiries everywhere . But it is always a dead-end . - Law enforcement is duty bound not to diverge any details . It 's a matter of public safety . - But Peter isn 't a danger to anyone . His ... only crime was speaking out . - We can 't treat everyone else one way and make an exception to your family . - I thought you might be able to tell me where he 's being held , or who we have to talk to . - You didn 't bring any information , did you ? Mood light three . Huh ... much more relaxing . Look , of course I know several county governors , but I 'd be really putting my head on a line , you know . - Please , if you can find him , I would do whatever I can to repay you . - How about you go into the garden and play for a bit while we talk business ?

Why did I let you into my house , you little shit ? - No ! Let me go ! - You know , boys without fathers are pittiable , the worst of the outside ! - Screw you ! - They 're gonna string you up , just as they are gonna string your father . - You win , general . - Right you are . Go see the moat . - Shit ... The more we sell , the more we 'll have . We 're gonna bribe someone to bring your father back . - Mom , what are you doing ? - We 're gonna sell this on the black market . - No , wait ! Not that ! - No , Djata , we need this money . - Stop ! Stop ! Mom. it 's gonna be OK . It 's gonna be OK . Did you get the stuff ? - Yeah . It 's gross . Djata ?

You have a concussion , but you 'll be fine . - You 're Pickaxe . - Here 's some tea for you . I 'm not gonna ask what you were doing down there . But it 's not a place for kids . Can you walk ? - I think so . - It 's OK , you can take a look around . Yes ... I have seen better days . - What happened to you ? - We all get offered a deal . Accept it . If not , you 're a traitor . That 's why they destroyed my face . In a camp . After they were done with me , they knew I 'd make an ideal guardian for their precious pit . For their dirty little secret . After all , who wants to talk to someone with a face like this ? - I do . My dad 's in a camp . - You should meet Tank . Good boy . You 're a good boy . What are you willing to give to see your father again ? - What would I ... give ? - We all have to lose something . Tank ! - Where have you been , huh ? - I ... - Huh ? ! Get in the car . Come here . Get in the car ! Put your belt on . Your mother and I have been up all night , searching for you . Huh ? ! Listen ... all I ever wanted for your father was a better life . I did everything I could . I made sacrifices for the Homeland . If Peter had stayed in the army , he 'd have had a better house , plenty of food , you 'd have gone to a better school ... - My school 's OK . - Yeah ... I warned him to hold his tongue , make smarter choices . Marry someone from a more ... appropriate family , but he chose his own path . Listen , I know you love him , believe me . We have done everything we can to find him , to get him back , but everyone turns their back on us . Even on me . Can you believe it ? - Do you think dad 's a traitor ? The Homeland is cruel , unforgiving , stupid . - But ... but you of ... - Fall 's coming . soon summer will be a forgotten dream . - Grandpa ? - Yeah ? - There were things I saw on the general 's house . Incredible . Amazing things . - Now , listen , you and your mom , you 've got to get away from here , across the border . Go anywhere , anywhere but here . Swim the ocean if you have to . Do you understand ? - Yeah . - Where have you been ? I looked everywhere . Are you OK ? - Yeah . I 'm sorry , mom . - Thank you . - Well , I 'm glad I could help . - Really ? Thank you . - You 're welcome . - I love you , Grandpa ! Grandpa ! Grandpa ! - Oh , my god ! Oh my god ! Help ! Help ! Help ! - How are you , Hannah ? - OK . - Djata ... We all respected your grandfather very much . - Yes we did . - Excuse me . - We should take our seats . - Djata ... I 'm scared , I shouldn 't have left , I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . Are we still cool ? - Yeah , we 're cool . - These seats are reserved . - I 'm so sorry for your loss . - Thank you so much . - Colonel ... Michael ... Fitz was a true ... soldier who dedicated his life to the Homeland . He campaigned tirelessly for the independence of our great country , and he was present at its birth . You know , at the beginning , we were just a ... a young nature of dreamers We were naive , but we were completely committed to the building of our new world . Then the colonel became part of an army that even today strives to protect our dreams so that we could live freely and simply and closer to the nature that we all love so much . But he ... always remained modest and self-controlled . To the colonel , he believed in our core values , which is that good will always triumph over vanity and ... corruption . Even when he was betrayed by his ... one of those he loved . Such was the strength of hid conviction . But Michael was also my husband . And in our ... private and family life , even until his last breath , he always maintained that we must make sacrifices today for a greater tomorrow . - Move . - We got two minutes . - Peter ... - Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! - Peter ! Oh my god , it 's you ! - Dad ... Dad ... - Peter , look at me ... I 'm here ... - Dad ... - Look at me ... hi ... Come back to me ... - Dad ... - Come on ! Move ! - I won 't take orders from you ! You can drop dead ! Peter ! Peter ! - Hannah ! - Mom ! - No ! No ! - I 'm OK ... - No ! - My father 's a good dad ! - Wait ! - Dad ! Dad ! - Djata ! - -The homeland is glorious , the homeland is free , Homeland stretches wide from the mountain ... to the sea ... Our many victories the fruits of truth and unity , our hearts ... - Jada ! are our brotherhood ... - Jada ! Our soul is liberty . Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha

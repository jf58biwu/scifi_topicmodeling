" All you need to do is have three cops - go to the ... - And do what ? Arrest somebody we think might kill somebody ? I mean , how do we prove he 's our guy ? You read the papers , you know that we don 't have any fingerprints , we don 't have any DNA . The news didn 't mention the sapphire ring that I took from the second girl . He 's a trophy keeper . You search his place , you find the sapphire ring he took from the second victim . Whoa . Hang on a second . We haven 't released that information . So , either a cop is selling information or you 're in direct contact with the killer , - and either way ... - I 've told you everything I know . - I have to go . - As a material witness in a murder investigation , you can be compelled to reveal your source . Let me check that with my husband . You may know him , actually . District Attorney Thomas Price .

Wait , wait , wait , wait . So , you 're saying this woman whose apartment you were arrested in , just happened to be drowning right in front of you ? - Correct . - Right where somebody - just happened to be trying to kill you . - Yeah , I know , it 's insane , live with it . She 's a suicide risk . Because of what happened to her daughter . Given the fact that her husband put my brother on death row , it 's a little awkward to inquire directly . So , I thought maybe you could find out if she 's okay . You don 't want us to talk to the people who tied you to a concrete block ? Already been handled . I did not hear that . So , you 're gonna check up on Laura Price or not ? - Not . - What ? I don 't have to . You can ask her yourself . Angel , we have to go . You know I can 't do it if you rush me . Mrs. Price .

Where a local fisherman discovered the body ... She disappeared . And then they found her in Black Pine Cove . She ... What ? Detective Kupner , would you take Serena and get her a glass of water , please ? What do you mean , " They found her in Black Pine Cove " ?

I understand your anger . I do . And I ... I 'm so sorry . I have to go . Please try to understand . Don 't blame me . I 'm trying to . That dream I had about Serena dying ... - Yeah . - It spooked me . And , normally , I would ignore it , but with all the killings , and being buried in work , I needed some time with her and I ... And I thought ... That you would take our daughter to Hawaii for two weeks without telling me ? I didn 't want you to talk me out of it . If you had told me you wanted to take Serena out of school for two weeks for a vacation , what would I say ? You can see her now . Thank you very much . Laura , what would I say ? I 'd say no . That you would think that you need to sneak away , where does that come from ? Do I have to put you on the nofly list ? Fate is your enemy . You can 't flee from her . What about knowing what my mother was gonna say before she actually said it ? Everybody knows what their mother is going to say ... No , no , Jenny , not like this . This was exact . Maybe , it 's some kind of longterm deja vu . Deja vu doesn 't include shards of glass at the bottom of Black Pine Cove . Like this is the first time you passed out and woke up with mysterious wounds ? All right . Okay , okay . Listen , I 'm a black out drunk . Black out , as in nothing in the head . Why is my head packed ? You wouldn 't believe the stuff I have in here . Stuff about you . Tell me I meet a humble , everyday girl who also happens to be a billionaire hedgefund manager . In July , you meet a girl named Jermaine , who you finally think is the one until you find out she puts affirmations on her mirror . Where did that come from ? Last three shots say you don 't believe it yourself . You don 't get it ? The next three shots say I don 't want to . Affirmations ? On little blue postits . Baby . You cannot win until the price is paid . For one to live , one must die . I 'm gonna fight it , angel . I 'm gonna win . I 'm gonna catch him myself . I swear to you . I swear . You 're going to live . Whoever has to die . Even if it 's me . I have a mess to clean up at work . I 'll be back late . Okay . Please check on Serena and make sure she 's okay . Yeah , of course , I will . What 's going on with you ? It 's a crazy time . I 'll be okay . You 're not okay now . I love you . And whatever 's going on , you can tell me anything . I love you too . I 'll call you . How do I do this ? How do I fight ? Is she your daughter ? Governor Dekizer , I need to talk to you . My son is Danny Jackson . I have proof that he was in custody without counsel for an hour . The jury never heard - the truth about his ... - I 'm gonna have to ask you to contact my office . Your son is a beautiful , young man . I know you love him . So you know how you would feel if somebody took him away from you forever . I 'm sorry , but this ... This isn 't appropriate . - I know ... - It 's all right . It 's all right . - This woman isn 't a threat . - Colleen ... She 's not a threat to anyone . She 's just doing whatever she can for her son . Just like we would . Is there an ongoing appeal ? Or , do you need a new attorney ? Only you can save my son . We are out of appeals . - Please , if you could just ... - Ma 'am , Please , step away . What if you had to tell your beautiful , little granddaughter that her father was going to die ? Could you give this to your husband , please ? Hello ? Excuse me . Wake up . I have to talk to you . Please , no knives to the skull . - I need you . - Please . In seven days , the man who 's been killing the women in the city , he 's going to drown my little girl , Serena , in Black Pine Cove . I need your help to catch him . It 's the only way I can save her . What do you need me for ? You know it 's gonna happen . You know when . You know where . You just gotta ... You gotta run out the clock . Keep her inside , don 't let her out of your sight . It doesn 't work that way . You can 't run . You have to fight . And you know that , how ? Not the first time your higher power hit the rewind button on you ? I know that because ... She told me . She also told me that water will take away the most important thing in my life . She 's my fiancee 's mother , Marjorie . How do you know her ? I met her in her shop . Yesterday . Not our yesterday . But ... Yesterday , yesterday . I can 't do this . He is going to kill another girl tonight . We have to stop that . What ? I can 't deal with this . But we ... But we know what she was wearing . A tshirt with a skull on it . - Skull ? - And there was a witness that saw her from 11 to 12 p.m. at a club . He can 't remember the name but knows it begins with a " P. " Hey ! Listen to me ! I have never believed in any force of any kind , or power . But something has made this happen . Pushed us together . My husband prosecuted your brother . Nothing is coincidence . Everything is connected . That 's what Marjorie said . No , no , there 's no way this can all be happening . There 's no way . I know why this happened to me . To save my daughter . There has to be a reason this happened to you . I refuse to believe that the ... The Universe would break every one of its rules , just so that Nico Jackson could get an extra few weeks to be a colossal disappointment . My brother ... They tried like crazy , but they couldn 't pull the switch on him until they had the death of your daughter to sell it with . What if that doesn 't happen this time ? Was Susanna with Marjorie when you saw her ? No . She wasn 't . I thought Susanna died . So did Marjorie . She died in a fire when her shop burned down . Five years ago . All right . I 'll meet you at Panda Boy at 10 : 45 . It 's the type of place that girls who dress in skulls like to dance . It 's a good place as any to start , all right ? Thank you . Hey ! Sorry to bother you , Mr. Price , but I think something of Serena 's got thrown out by mistake . Thank you . Thank you , Joe . You almost died . That 's right . So I didn 't get to go to Hawaii . But I get to stay home from school till I 'm all better . You know what my grandma says is the best cure for everything ? Lemon juice . It makes your lips pucker up , but if you have a cold , that cold is gone . Urgh ! I gotta go . Talk to you tomorrow . Peace ! Peace ! Nico ... Nico ... - Can he hug me ? - Go ahead . Hey , buddy . Okay , take your seats . Yeah . - Sit down . - Okay . You came ... You came to see me . Yeah . A lot of days late and a lot of dollars short . Why did you come ? Did mom 's car get in an accident ? - No ! - DidDid Ruby get hurt ? Nothing like that . Everybody is fine . Just wanted to see you . Why didn 't you come before ? Man , you know , sometimes , it 's like you 're asleep and something wakes you up , you know . Thank you for coming . Hey , bud , come here . Come here , come here . Yeah . Yeah . That ... - That 's dad 's watch . - Yeah . It is . Hey , Ruby won 't let the camera out of her sight . The old man lives on ? II won 't ... - Live on . - You will live on . If I have anything to say about it , you will . Are you gonna make them not kill me ? I 'm gonna try . Will they ... Will they let me go ? Can I walk Ruby to school every day ? Well , I don 't think that 's such a good idea , buddy . What if you hurt somebody else you didn 't mean to hurt ? Please move to the secured area immediately . This facility is on lockdown . Sir , will you please step out of the cage ? BBye , Nico . Please come back . - I will . - Promise ? Promise . Hey , take care of yourself . We 're asking all visitors to step into a secure area . Until further notice this facility is in a lockdown situation . Can I have my cell phone back ? I have someone I have to call . That won 't be possible at this present time .

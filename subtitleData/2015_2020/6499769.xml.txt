She 's trying to replicate the original atomic test . - How do you mean ? - She 's a scientist . And every scientist knows that , in order to achieve the same results in an experiment , every variable must be identical . That means setting off an atomic bomb in the same location a-and opening that rift or whatever it was . I can 't emphasize this enough ... We cannot let her do this . Then , we 'll just have to stop her . Which means stopping an atomic bomb . Not just any bomb ... The bombs used in the Isodyne test . Those were manufactured by Roxxon . After 1946 , the two remaining warheads were put in storage . Well , it won 't be the first time we 've infiltrated a Roxxon facility . They have several facilities , and the location of each is classified . There 's no way to know which one is housing the bombs . Well , that 's ... not entirely accurate . Mr. Stark 's rivalry with Hugh Jones is ever ongoing . He 's had extensive research done on Roxxon and all its facilities . Call it corporate espionage . There is one particular Roxxon location a few hours outside of Los Angeles , which I believe would be the most likely place . Why is it our leading contender ? The security . Compared to the other facilities , it 's quite intense . I believe the word " impenetrable " was used . In my experience , nothing is impenetrable . That may well be , but Mr. Stark has never been able to get anyone inside this particular location . The elevator requires a special key ... One that 's impossible to duplicate . We don 't need a key . We 'll blow the hinges off the door . Which would trigger the explosives set inside them and kill us all . We 'll drill into the lock . Which would Pierce the acid core , spraying into the elevator , and kill us all . We 'll dig a hole ... Which would trip the 3,000-volt mechanism underground ... - and kill us all . - And kill us all . So , a key , you say ? We cannot steal atomic bombs . It 's not stealing if your company made them , dear . Well , tell that to Hugh Jones . - If the council found out , I ... - If we obtain more zero matter , Cal , then the council answers to us . This is insane . People thought Galileo was insane . This plan will work , Cal . It will work . Look at me . You have seen what I can do with just a small amount of zero matter . I mean , can you imagine ? Just imagine what we could accomplish if we had the power to bend the world to our will . No more war , no more fear , and you ... you ... you would finally get the recognition and the respect that you deserve . [ Breathes sharply ] How do you , uh , see us accomplishing this , hmm ?

Violet 's a lucky woman . Thank you . That means a lot . Can I speak to you a moment ? Yeah . Thompson called , poking around for you again . How many vacation days you got left ? Plenty . I haven 't had a day off since Pearl Harbor . How is your disguise department shaping up ? For you ? Low on evening gowns . Why ? I need to sneak into Hugh Jones ' office . At Roxxon ? Are you sure that 's a good idea ? Didn 't you meet him last year in New York ? I 'm sure he doesn 't pay that much attention to every woman he meets . Oh . He 'd remember you , Peg . The guys at the lab have something new . If it works , you wouldn 't have to rely on just a disguise . Thanks . We 'll need this . What for ? Greasing the wheel . [ Inhales deeply ] What 's the catch ? No catch , Dr. Samberly . Just pie . We thought you 'd enjoy a slice . And m-maybe Agent Carter could borrow that thing you 're working on .

[ Groaning ] [ Breathing quickly ] [ Groaning ] [ Knuckles crack ] ♪ I 'm sorry about that . He was being very inappropriate . So do we have a deal ? Deal . This field serves as a runway for private planes . There 's a minimum of four guards , all heavily armed , stationed within this perimeter . And this fence is electrified , I assume . Indeed . Once we 're inside the building , we 'll need to find the freight elevator and use the key to access the lower levels , where Roxxon stores its highly classified items . So you 're saying once we get past the guards and the electrified fence , all we have to worry about is diffusing the atomic bombs ? Actually , I don 't think you 'll need to worry on that front . Chief Sousa has the steadiest hands I 've seen . Well , since mine , of course . Former reconnaissance scout . Let 's just say this won 't be my first time diffusing a bomb . These aren 't just bombs . One mishandled uranium rod could trigger an explosion that would decimate the entire city . Sounds like a bomb to me . [ Salami thuds ] You just destroyed all of Los Angeles . And this is all the intelligence that we have ? Nothing from the inside ? I 'm afraid Mr. Stark 's men have never been able to gain access . We 'll be going in blind . And unarmed , given the volatile nature of the materials inside . And severely outmanned . I don 't like this . Are we sure the SSR isn 't an option ?

 Previously on Continuum ... Am I your mother ? Emily . This is far from over . So bottom line : trust my team . You can 't do this alone . We need that building . I have plenty of buildings . No , it has to be that one . You took something from them . It looks like a pen ? They need it back . This battle isn 't over ! It 's hardly begun . We 're only gonna get through this if we trust each other , Kiera . I trust you . I trust you , too . I saw you with her , Brad . What were you doing with her ? You know , I think back to before all this , before you , and I don 't ever see it going back to normal . Now , is that a good thing ? I don 't know . All I know is what I see in front of me , and everything looks worse . Is that what you had planned in the end ? Who says this is the end ? Look around you , Travis . Liber8 failed . Failed ? Liber8 was sent back to be vaccine . An injection of sickness to stimulate society 's immune system . Even the protector believes , now . That 's only half true . What 's true is you 're going to be releasing me very soon . Oh yeah ? Why is that ? Knowledge is power . I do have an idea . One that will help with our future soldier problem . What kind of idea ? Release Travis into my custody . Oh , is that all ? Fair enough . I know it sounds crazy . You could say that . I 'm enjoying this . Shut up . You want me to deal with Kellogg 's soldiers . That means I need soldiers of my own . Travis is our best weapon in this fight , you and I both know it . No . In case you haven 't noticed , we are in a police department , ok ? There 's an entire force on call to help bring down the bad guys . Not bad guys like this . They are organized , they are well-trained , and they have access to weaponry even I have never encountered . With Brad on the inside and Travis 's help , we can do things the police can 't do . How 's that working out for you ? Your inside man ? Where is he right now ? Why hasn 't he told you where they are ? I trust him . That 's the problem right there . You trust him more than you trust me . Instead of believing in me you 're putting faith in a man you hardly know who 's a little too cozy with the enemy if you ask me . I hate to say it , but the man has a point . Without that key it doesn 't matter if we 're ahead of schedule or behind . If Tonkin can 't get it , what benefit is it to the mission ? I 'm right here , Zorin . Are you ? 'Cause I don 't see you engaged , Tonkin . I see an opportunist . Someone who 's soft . Someone who 's a little confused about his loyalties . If Tonkin wanted to give us up we 'd be drowning in our own blood . Every second we 're not means he 's doing his job . You swing at one of my men again , I 'll kill you . I 'm gonna have to ask you to - Ok , ok . Look , whatever they 're paying you , I 'll triple it . You can 't buy me . You already have . Who sent you ? You did . Via Marcellus . You think you 're untouchable , you 're not . I 'm here to change that . You could have just introduced yourself . Didn 't I ? Shaboof ! I don 't care if it 's popular in 2077 , please never " shaboof " as a taunt or dis or catchphrase ever again . Don 't take out your break-up angst on me , I was trying to distract you . He 's right , you gotta get over it . Let 's go again . I 'll pass . I 'm through being humiliated for one day . I don 't know , man . Pace yourself . After Kellogg took away your legacy , you 've got a lifetime of humiliation ahead of you . I seem to recall Kellogg playing you like a marionette then tossing you aside like everything else he 's done with . Yeah , but I 'm supposed to be his enemy . You , you were actually supposed to be him . The way I see it , he did you a favour . How 's that ? You wanted to change your destiny , right Alec ? He changed it for you . You dodged a bullet . Me ? I 'm still here , destined to be the bad guy . Says who ? Bad guy is a matter of perspective . Yeah , well based on my pending body counts I think it 's safe to say sainthood isn 't in my future . You both sound like a couple of babies . Here 's a tip : take action . Man up . You 're the author of your own destiny . Act like it . What is that ? The beginning of Theseus 's great manifesto . Apparently . I remember reading that for the first time when I was 14 . I 'm literally watching history being written . I hate to burst your bubble , Lucas , but I refuse to be the monster everyone talks about . No , no , no ! This was a legacy better left unrealized , I think . As simple as that ? Probably not , no . I can 't help but think the future will be better off . Hello again . Move . I think you should make me . I wouldn 't dream of starting this meeting without you . Visitors wait over there . Don 't worry , this won 't take long . Kidnapping and unlawful confinement ? That 's a serious accusation . You better arrest me . You 'd be in cuffs right now if I wanted to arrest you . Oh , so this is just some sort of power trip ? Something to fill your time ? No . He knows that your lawyers would have you out in less than an hour . He just wants you to know he 's here and he 's got you in his sights . You taught me well . We can go . Ok . Sit down . Or what ? Detention . I think throwing you downstairs with Travis until your lawyers spring you would be all kinds of fun . Well , for Travis , that is . Are you sure you want to play this game ? See , that 's the difference between you and I , Kellogg . You actually think this is a game . That 's exactly what this is . I don 't need lawyers to fight my battles . I can simply starve this division of every resource it needs . I 'm going to go see Nora and remind her just how important I am to the well-being of this department . I give her detailed and incriminating information about our friend Emily , our friend Alec , and Detective Special Agent whatever Kiera Cameron here if it 's a war you want . And if that still doesn 't put a stop to this clear campaign of harassment then I 'm sure the mayor , City Hall , and some other entities I have in my back pocket will perform the roll of jack boot to your oversized neck and you 'll find yourself running parking tickets on skid row . Now either arrest me or get the hell out of my way . What exactly did you think you were going to get out of this ? The truth . You remember what that is , don 't you ? History dictates the truth , Inspector , not you . Right and wrong . That 's all anybody remembers . Well , I remember when you used to take down guys like him . You give me the evidence that I need and I will gladly use his own Piron initiative to Guantanamo his ass . Can I be there when that happens ? Oh yeah . And throw away the key . Alec , what are you doing here ? Well , I was thinking about my future and how I need to take it in a new direction . I want to help the police department . Officially . Work here ? You need somebody to take over Betty 's duties . Keep talking . Betty was a civilian , I 'm a civilian . You guys hire non-police around here all the time , right ? We do , yeah , but come on , you can get a job with any tech giant in the world . Yeah , but no tech giant is gonna help me wipe that smirk off of Kellogg 's face . Sold . Really ? Yeah . That 's great , thank you . Welcome aboard . Officially . I 'll have Patrick get the ball rolling . In the meantime , can you show Alec to Betty 's old office ? Fonnegra . Hey , hey . Guys , hold on . When ? Alright , send it through . Well , I could use you right now . Feel like punching in early ? Sure , what happened ? Someone stole all the superconducting magnets from Faber University 's physics lab . That 's not your every day BE . No , it 's not . Witnesses reported them escaping in a black van . I think it 's our guys . That campus is thick with surveillance . I 'll see if I can track the van , see where they 're headed . Perfect . Let 's go . I can work with this . Good . Alec , I have to ask you a favour . Please . Come to me first with any information you find out about the van or Kellogg 's soldiers . Great . I 'm on the job for five seconds and you 're already asking me to lie to Carlos ? I 'm not asking you to lie , just to delay a bit . What 's the difference ? Why don 't you work your magic on the van report , see what you can find ? Wanna help me clean it up ? I 'm not the one who decided to make a dramatic statement about the direction of my life using fire . The mess is on you . Yeah . Oh , you 're gonna want to see this . Looks like the complete Theseus collection can be yours for the low price of free . Find out who did this . Is this you talking , or ... Theseus . I 've got about 25 black vans in the area via traffic cams . Awkward . Maybe you can track where Brad is headed . New construction projects , condemned buildings ... This is Vancouver . You 're gonna have to narrow down your search . Odd energy consumption ? Do you know how many grow-ops are in the city ? Ok , I get it , I 'm sorry . You 're right , you know what you 're doing . I will leave you alone , just ... please , come to me first . Yeah . Thank you . Where was Kiera going in such a hurry ? Did you get a lead on the van ? Van ? Oh , shit . I 've been so busy trying to configure my computer to the system that I completely forgot to ask Kiera where she was going . She didn 't say ? No , she didn 't say . Hmm . So I need you to do me a favour . I want you to track Kiera 's CMR and keep me updated on her movements . Spy on her ? The whole reason we work so well together is because of our trust in each other . I can 't risk losing that again . I get it . Ok , don 't think of it as spying . Kiera 's feelings for Brad have got her head out of the game . That 's gonna get her in a very dangerous situation . I just want to ensure that we 're there to protect her when that happens . I 'll watch out for her , but you 're gonna have to trust my discretion . Deal . Oh , I almost forgot . Welcome to the team . Kiera ? I 'm here . So these superconducting magnets got me thinking . You know that doohicky that you stole from Kellogg 's soldiers ? It is off the scale magnetic and I think I just found the on switch . What makes you say that ? You kind of have to see it to understand it , but it lines up with one mother of a magnetic field . I drew a line from the precinct and it runs straight into a vacant factory a few blocks away from the van 's last recorded location . Piron . Shaboof . Excuse me ? Nevermind . What would Prion want with an abandoned factory ? It 's not scheduled for demo , no phone or internet hook-up . Paid two million over market value . Kellogg must have really wanted it for something . Well then we need to find out what that something is . Send Lucas the details and meet me at your place as soon as possible . I haven 't even had my first coffee break and you 're asking me to play hooky ? Technically , you 're not on the clock , so get out of there and meet me . And tell Carlos what ? Don 't . I hope your plan is better than your communication skills . Yes ? Hi , I 'm Julian Randol . Theseus . You know me as Theseus . Please , come in . Uh , can I get you some - No , thanks . I just want to know why you published my manifesto . Because I told her to . Oh good , you 're here . Nice image . I can almost see the syringes on the street . What 'd you find ? Well , that 's just it . Nothing . I haven 't found a single work order or city permit for this location . But I hacked a nearby traffic cam , you see Piron trucks bringing in material and equipment all day . They 're building something . And we won 't know what it is until we get inside . Garza , you and I will infiltrate , see what 's going on . Lucas , you 'll be on the outside keeping your eyes open for any surprises . I 'll be the eye in the sky from here ? Exactly . So we 'll get in , get what we want , we 'll get out and meet back here to debrief and devise any follow-up action . I love it when you talk tactics . No engagement , Garza . This is recon only . Says the girl in the invisible bullet-proof suit . How am I supposed to get inside if our targets are home ? Ask nicely ? I 'm an admirer of Theseus , just like our host , Mrs. Kagame . You can do it . Edward Kagame ? That 's it . Why did you come here ? She published my words online for everyone to see . I didn 't want that . Why not ? What are you afraid of ? I really don 't think you 'd understand . I understand more than you think . For instance , I know that in 20 years you 're gonna organize the largest revolution against corporate power the world has ever seen . Hundreds of thousands will die as a result and you will lose . How do you know that ? I 've seen it . Then you should know exactly why I can 't let that manifesto influence this child . Don 't be a coward . There is no certainty . You control your own destiny , Julian . No , I will not be responsible for a war . Then don 't be . How am I going to not , huh ? I 'll second guess every decision I make for the rest of my life . As you should . Your influence on the future has already begun whether you like it or not . Would you rather bury your head in the sand or take action now to ensure that your teachings are never bastardized by fanatics ? Can I get anyone a warm-up on their tea , or ... ? No , thank you , but I think I should just probably be leaving . Julian . The world needs you , Julian . It looks empty . Yet worth protecting . Piron guards . Are you sure about this ? Yeah , let 's do this . Ok , remember , you don 't have your CMR so your suit only has it 's minimal functions . Body armour , electro-taser , active camouflage . Yeah , yeah . Alec , we 've got a problem . Yeah , you sure do . I got bad news . Looks like our friends have been expecting you . They 've got some sort of high-frequency disruption field . Anti-cloaking tech . You 'll get five , maybe seven seconds , tops before it shuts down again . Who knows how many times . You want to abort ? No , we 've come this far . Let 's go . Alec , I hope you 're getting this . Yeah , I am . What am I getting ? I have no idea . Seven seconds . Alec ? Alec ! Ambient energy readings are off the charts . We need to find out what that thing is . Who cares ? We know it can 't be good . You 're right . We 'll need to stop them now , while they 're vulnerable . What happened to recon only ? They aren 't expecting us . This may be our only chance . What 's the plan ? We destroy it . Mommy like . Don 't even think about it . Get to work . Alec , can you isolate what Brad and Marcellus are saying ? Not from a window from this distance . What about now ? Try analyzing their lip movements . I 'm too busy trying to figure out what this thing is that they 're building . Come on , Alec . I don 't understand why you trust this guy . He killed other you and if you 're not careful he could do it again . Time to go . Once I trigger the fuse I figure we 've got about 90 seconds , give or take . Figure ? You 're welcome . I 'll be the one that gets it close enough to whatever they 're building . No need . There 's enough C4 in that baby , this place will be nothing but a smoking hole in the ground . Garza . What ? The plan was to take that thing down , not murder everybody in the process . Why are you always so goddamn soft , Kiera ? It 's war , they 're the enemy . If it 's not them then it 's gonna be us , and I can 't have that . Holy shit . What ? Uh ... don 't blow it up . Those cylinders are showing signs of a highly concentrated anti-matter fusion system . In english please , Alec . What 's he saying ? The kind of power to get you home . Or ... Or what ? My hypothesis is if it is an anti-matter system then this gadget is some sort of quantum processor . I just couldn 't see it until now . We need to reassess . Mission aborted . Let 's go . It 's Brad , isn 't it ? You 're willing to put our lives at risk for him . Garza . Oh , you really want to do this ? Shit . Garza , get up . We 've gotta go . We gotta go now ! We 've gotta get out of here . No . Garza , no ! What the hell was that ? It was me . I installed a fail-safe control on my end . She 'll be fine . Yeah . Great . But it only works if we make it out alive and right now she 's unconscious . Lucas , it 's hitting the fan in there . That 's a surprise . You 're gonna have to get closer . Construction 's gonna be a little hot . Copy . Alec , is Lucas ready yet ? He 's standing by the north side of the building , up the corridor and to the left . Ok , got it . Oh , shit . Ok , look . They must have found the one we already took out . Garza ? Are you alright ? Yeah . What happened ? There are two of them . Both in cloaking tech . You know , I don 't know what your game is , Tonkin , but it 's falling apart . There 's no game . All evidence to the contrary . Enough . We 'll have this conversation after we secure the perimeter . Prove him wrong . Nobody leaves the building . You two stay with the others . Protect the site . Garza ? Wake up . What happened ? We 've gotta get out of here now , just trust me . Up . Fine . This way ! Go , go , go ! Keep them pinned down , I 'll get reinforcements ! They fried our suits ! Alec , they 've disabled our tech . We need another way out , now ! You 're at a dead end . The only way out is through them . Lucas , they 're trapped . They may not make it out without your help . That 's gonna be a little tricky . Out of the van . Look , if you don 't get in there , they die . I 'm trying . Try harder . Ok , alright . I 'm stepping out . Alright ? Just be cool . Calm . Step away from the vehicle . I 'm stepping away . I 'm stepping away . Sector three , one - I 'm on my way . Intruders cordoned on level one west corridor . We won 't survive without weapons . Garza , no ! Garza ! Aaarrrghh ! Come on ! Hiya ! I could have helped . You 're welcome . We should finish this right now . Why are we running ? Because I don 't feel like dying today . You should see a door straight ahead . Up ahead . End of the line for you . No ! LUCAS ! NO ! LUCAS ! We have to go . We have to go . He killed Lucas . What ? How could you ? It 's your fault , Kiera . Don 't you dare . We had them kneecapped and you chickened out . It 's your fault . I couldn 't let you blow it up . To save that asshole who killed Lucas ? Selfish bitch . It has nothing to do with Brad , don 't you see ? We could all go home . Newsflash , you 're the only one who wants to go back . Lucas died trying to prevent that shitty future . You 're spitting in his face wanting to preserve it . Pull over . Not until we 're clear . Pull over . I don 't know if you grunts are aware but moving from this site has never been an option . That means we work double time to finish . I want centuries tripled . We Vasquez , push Kellogg to provide us with additional security . Now it 's not a question of if the police show up , but when . Understood ? I said , understood ? Who put you in charge ? Excuse me ? This is a military op . He 's now the ranking officer . Marcellus is dead . That falls on his head . He 's a goddamn liability . We took out one of theirs . That should count for something . Damn right . I don 't know . What don 't you know ? We 're soldiers , or did you already forget the chain of command ? I signed up for this mission and I 'm gonna see it through . Yeah , you are . Will you two act like professionals ? Is this what you wanted ? No . This isn 't what Marcellus would have wanted . Zorin should take command . The mission is priority . You want to honour Marcellus 's sacrifice ? This is the best way . Everything from this point forward has accelerated . We are in key protocol one . No ins or outs without my say so . And get me that key , Tonkin . Alec ? It 's not your fault . I sent him in there . I told him you needed help . It 's more complicated than that . You know it . What 's more complicated ? Did you get a lead on that black van ? Dead end . So ... where were you guys all day ? I followed a lead , hit the same dead end . And I needed to grab some more components for the system . It 's top notch , just not exactly CMR compatible , you know ? Yeah . Get on it . Make something happen . Brad is clearly not who you think he is . So why are you protecting him ? I 'm not protecting him . Why are we lying to Carlos ? We need to preserve that site until we know more . If what you discovered about the anti-matter fuel cells is true , then - This is all about you , then ? What about Kellogg and his plans ? Whatever he 's up to is going to ensure that I get what I want and Kellogg gets what he deserves . How did it happen ? Garza and I were investigating Kellogg 's soldiers . They 're building some sort of machine , I don 't know what it 's for . We got in trouble . Lucas saved our lives . Thank you for telling me . I know that look . You blame yourself . Don 't . Lucas knew what the end game was sure to be . Next Sonya , Kagame . All of us . He was always willing to give his life for the cause . Doesn 't make it any easier . Your journey was never gonna be an easy one , protector . I know . It 's getting harder and harder to choose which path to take . Which decisions are the right ones . I want to do right by everyone without sacrificing what I need . What do you need ? It doesn 't matter . Look at me . There 's no surrender in this fight . You 've come a long way . Open your eyes to the truth . This truth . Kellogg is more dangerous than any of us . Greed is his drug and his weakness . You have to stop him at all costs . Are you willing to do that ? Yes . Kellogg will not succeed . Where have you been ? Oh , you know , just out discovering I may have already influenced the most dangerous terrorist since Bin Laden . How was your night ? Lucas is dead . Wow . Guys like him shouldn 't have to die because of guys like us , right ? Yeah . I think I 'm done , Alec . I just gotta go . Go where ? Be the author of my own destiny , just like Lucas said , right ? Wait a second . I 've been reading what you wrote . Future you . It 's actually quite beautiful . Full of new ideas , unique perspectives . Maybe if I don 't become the evil corporate overlord of the future , you go on to be come Mother fricken Theresa . And who knows , maybe in a few decades we 're not trying to kill each other . Look , all I 'm trying to say is don 't fear these words . People need to see them . Why don 't you grab a glass ? Not thirsty . Oh , come on . Your shift is over . Don 't they relax where you came from ? When we 're not fighting ? We live . Devour . Sleep . Pleasure . Each other . I knew we had a lot in common . Drink with me , and we 'll toast to pleasure . You confuse it for a request . I insist . The glasses are behind the bar . Oh , you are good . You should have spoken up earlier , I would have had her fetch two . No , thank you . Oh , that 's right . You 're a straight from the bottle kinda gal . We need to talk about the little renovation project you have going on with your new future friends across town . If you want information you 're gonna have to play nice . I don 't play nice with people I don 't trust . What 's trust got to do with it ? The way I see it , me , them , other me , we 're your only option . Them ? Your new friends ? They killed Lucas today . That 's unfortunate . He was a good man . A brilliant man . In a simple sort of way . She 's good , isn 't she ? It 's ok , put it down . Kiera was just leaving . Goodnight . May I ask you a personal question , Matthew ? Anything . If nobody can trust you , then tell me : how can you trust you ?

 We talked all night . He was an amazing listener . Maybe my alien experience is highlighting some problems in my marriage . Have you ever sought consolation in Christ ? You were supposed to wipe his mind , and then implant a memory to mask the entire experience . But he 's supposed to have a memory of hitting a deer , not seeing them in his waking life . Subject 19076 . Retired , 72 years old , widowed . Subject demonstrated a need for nonsexual , physical contact . 978 , 979 , 9 hundred ... Subject 19077 . Subject has a fascination with puzzles and modern warfare , demonstrated a need for social collaboration . Subject 's memories were wiped . No memories of our encounter will remain . Saving . Thanks for listening . I haven 't felt this comfortable talking to anybody in a while . I feel like I could tell you anything . - Thank you . - You are an awesome listener . Anyway , what ... what about you ? What 's your deal ? I ... No one has ever asked me anything ... about my deal . Damn it ! Stupid piece of crap ! Garbage stuff that just gets in the way ... H-hey ! Jeff , you seem angry . Just going through our research on 28409 , and he 's demonstrated a heightened ability to recover memories . Yeah , that 's why Kurt put the implant in him in the first place . Well , if you ask me , 28409 's a time bomb . I 'm gonna attempt a manual reset . That 's very , very risky . I 'll figure it out . I 'm pretty technical . Did that do anything ? I can 't even tell . I 'm not sure this is wise with your lack of patience and little fingers . Off . You want to be helpful ? Kurt 's killer is still at large . See if you can track down the car that hit him . It had an " Empathy " bumper sticker . Find it . The bumper . Hey , Nancy , I 'm not feeling that great , so if it 's cool , I 'm just gonna duck out a little early . Okay . Dengue fever ? It 's unlikely . Ovarian cysts ? No . I wonder if I hold these two down at the same time ... Man , these guys are good . Thank God . Hi , am I interrupting ? No ... just doin ' the Lord 's work . I 'm kidding . Times crossword . Anyway , I just wanted to stop by and tell you that I picked up one of these . Well , that 's great . - How do you like it ? - I 'm loving it . I actually really , um ... you know who I 'm digging ? I 'm digging , um , Mary . - Of course , Mary . - I don 't know . She 's great . I just really relate to what she went through . I feel like we 're , um ... I don 't know ... I feel like we 're the same . Is that blasphemous ? No . No . Mary 's the best ... courageous , small-town girl , a bit of a rebel , rode a donkey nine-months pregnant . And that 's a strong female protagonist , actually . - Okay , I 'll let you get back . - Okay . You know , Chelsea , we are ... we 're discussing Mary in Bible Study this week . I know . If you want to drop by ... Yeah ! Okay . It 's a date . It 's a date . Hi . Kelly . Kelly likes coffee . I 'm not sure if it 's a thyroid thing , or maybe it 's low blood sugar ? Okay , okay . Here 's what you do for headaches . You take children 's aspirin , you crush it up , you put it in a club soda , you pour that in your neti pot , and then you flush that through your sinuses . I don 't think a neti pot is gonna work for a thyroid condition . Listen , there 's not a single thing that a neti pot can 't cure . I 've got a spare one in my car if you 'd like me to get it . I 've got to be honest with you , I 'm not really aaaaaah ... God damn it . The system 's frozen . - Aaaaaaaaah ... - I don 't want to pressure you , - so you just ... - aaaaaaaaaah ... think about it . Aaaaaaaaaah ... Okay . Rebooting . Aaaaaa ... neti pot guy . I think I 'm gonna break up with Karl . Why ? He seemed so nice . Yeah , he seemed nice . - Is he not ? - No , he is . Do you feel like there may be a pattern here ? Yeah . Dudes are the worst . Or maybe you 're having a hard time sustaining a relationship in the wake of your experience . - My experience was kind of great . - Well , maybe that 's the problem . Maybe everything else pales in comparison . No . I ... think it 's just that he 's very boring . Plus he says " Ore-gone . " " I 'm going to ' Ore-gone . ' " It 's Oregon . Yeah . - You say Ore-gones . - Oregons ? - Dump him . - You don 't say " Al-lab-a-ma . " - I say Oregon . - Ore-gon . Body parts ... Stop ! Richard , stop it ! Your sipping is killing me . I 'm so sorry . I-I 'm sorry . It 's just that my head ... it 's-it 's throbbing again . The headaches ... they 're back ? I 'll get the neti . I don 't know what it is . It ... it ... Something is seriously wrong . Aliens probably put a microphone in your head . - There it is . - That 's when my headaches started . Thanks for that , but I 'm gonna go with something a bit more reasonable , medically speaking . Maybe , like , mad cow ? Dude , I think Ennis is right . It sounds like alien dickery . No , I think we 're all tip-toeing around the T-word . - Microphone ? - Not " Microphone , " Ennis . - The T-word . T ! - T-Tequila ? Now I 'm starting to have hallucinations . Hallucinations ? Headaches ? That 's a tumor . Maybe ... can we not be so free with the word " tumor " ? Okay . I ... I think I need to go to a hospital . - Dibs ! - I better do it . I 'm his sponsor . No offense ... I think I 'm gonna have Gerry take me , because he 's the only one in this room that is not dressed exactly like me . Okay . You guys better get a move on . Okay , Mr. Graham ... in a minute , I 'm going to ask you to take a deep breath in and hold it . You 're doing great buddy . Sir , you 're not supposed to be in here . Just stay calm , buddy . I 'll be right out here when you 're done . Okay , Mr. Graham ... deep breath in , hold it . And get ready to boogie . No . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . John , I forgot I have a thing to do today . - Not that alien-group thing ? - No . Good . Love you . Hi . Am I in the right place ? There 's a lot of kids . It 's an intro class . It 's open to everyone . Okay . Hello . That seat 's saved . That 's kind of weird , ' cause I 'm already sitting in it . Eyes up here . So , does everyone understand the Virgin Birth ? Yes . That is when Mary has God 's baby . That 's right . Jesus . It doesn 't make sense , because she 's a virgin . Well , that 's where the miracle of it comes into play . Couldn 't she have been lying about being a virgin ? That 's what Joseph thought . Yes , but he was very , very wrong . Put yourself in her shoes ... a divine being shows up in the middle of the night in your bedroom , tells you you 're special ... ? Of course your husband isn 't going to believe that . He probably thinks you 're just doing this for some sort of attention . But who wants that kind of attention ? Who would want that kind of attention ? Are ... are we still talking about the Bible ? - Yes . Yes . - No . Yes . Is it my thyroid ? God . It 's my thyroid , isn 't it ? Someone 's been using the Internet . - Maybe . - If you look here , this little little opaque spot is a mass . A mass ? Can you be more specific ? - Is it a tumor ? - We don 't know . What do you mean you don 't know ? You 're a doctor . I 'm not comfortable guessing . - Maybe it 's your twin . - It 's not a twin . That does happen . Y ... you know what , could you maybe wait outside ? Yep . So , this mass ... what do we do ? Do we run some more tests ? Do we wait it out ? We 'd actually like to remove it . Immediately . - Today ? - Well , you could wait , but most people don 't roll the dice on brain stuff . Okay . I got this . All righty ... Warning ... you are about to replace this subject 's memory permanently . - Do you want to save ? - Nope ! Commencing defragmentation . Goodbye , 28409 's mind . All your memories will be lost . Pity . Signal lost . Signal lost ? How ? What ? Why ? ! You piece of crap ! Hey , bud . I was here the whole time . - How you feelin ' ? - Gerry . I 'm pretty groggy . Mr. Graham , you 're up . - Your operation went very well . - Yeah . You 'll be glad to know it was not a tumor . - Great . What was it ? - Well , it 's funny ... it didn 't appear as a foreign object on your skin , but it seems to be a tiny piece of metal . - Metal ? - Metal ? I said the same thing . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's , a very uniform . Wait . How did this get into this ? I can think of one reason . Aliens . Boop . " What does it mean if I get a signal lost error ? " " Subject removed the chip . " How could he remove the chip ? What are you doing ? I don 't want to contaminate it by touching it . Smells weird ... like glass . How did a piece of metal get stuck in my head ? It has to be aliens . But why ? Mind control ? We should take it to a lab . They probably have one here . But can we trust them ? How long do you think it would take to drive to NASA ? But can we trust them ? Pick up , pick up ! Pick up ! God , useless ! He removed the chip ? ! I might need you to retrieve it . Wait , I 'm sorry , Jeff . I-I couldn 't hear you . I might need you to retrieve the chip , if you care about evidence of our existence lying around . Wait , you , the great Jeff need help from lowly me ? Okay , can we not do this ? I 'll offer you my help if you ask nicely . Repeat after me ... - " Jonathan " ... - Jonathan ... " I 'm a slimy , little bitch . " - I 'm not saying that . - I 'm not helping you . I 'm a slimy little bitch . - " Please get the chip . " - Please get the chip . I didn 't like your tone . Let 's try it again . - Just do it ! - All right , Jeff , I 'll save you and the invasion , again . His hapless bearded friend Gerry called today , said he was at the hospital . I 'm on it . - Hi ! - Hi . I don 't want to interrupt your crossword puzzle . Actually , I 'm working on my homily . Well , um , I just wanted to touch base with you about the , um ... the last class . I feel like things maybe got a little weird . - Did they get weird ? Did you feel that ? - Well , I ... I mean , you somehow managed to steal the spotlight away from the mother of God . I feel badly about that , but , um ... see , something unexplainable happened to Mary , and something unexplainable happened to me , and I guess I was just really excited to ... talk to you about it . And the enthusiasm was great , just not super appropriate for that crowd . Yeah , sorry . I think I ... I thought this was a book about explaining that kind of thing . Don 't worry . I won 't be coming back to Bible Study . You 're having a hard time connecting to me . Have you ever considered the fact that you 're the one who 's hard to connect to ? No , I haven 't , actually . So , I guess we 're canceling our trip to Ore-gone . - It 's Oregon . - What ? It 's pronounced " Oregon . " - Well , it 's not actually . - Yeah , it is . And I kind of can 't believe that you 're correcting my pronunciation right now . It 's just ... it 's a thing with me , okay ? Sorry . Goodbye , Karl . You 're a nice person . I hope you figure it out . I couldn 't help but overhear everything . - You were listening ? - Yeah . That 's weird . Mind your own business . I made you this . Um , I made you this . I don 't know what that means . I 'm just gonna leave that there for you . Thank you . What the ... Hey , Gerry , I think it was alien technology . - What ? - Why 's that so hard for me to say ? I don 't like it , but I 'm owning it . Yeah . Own it , buddy . You 're my best friend . I 'm tired . Okay , buddy , I 'm gonna go to the loo . Hey . Who are you ? - Ozzie 's co-worker Nancy . - That 's cool . - Jonathan sends his regards . - Jonathan ? Couldn 't make it down himself ? I thought he was Ozzie 's best friend . I 've been here all night long . Ozzie just said I was his best friend . I can see he 's sleeping . I 'll be on my way . Sleeping like a baby . I 'll tell him you dropped by . - Where 's the metal ? - What 's going on , Gerry ? Where is it ? Where is what ? Where 's the tray ... the vial ? The tray 's not there ! Yeah . The vial 's gone . - Help ! - Help . Hey , when this is over , I 'm gonna write a book all about this , and you 're gonna be in it . I would really be interested in hearing about this , buddy , but we 're in DEFCON 5 . Yeah ? No , I 'm not doing anything . I can talk numbers . Okay , 80 % LTV origination ... it 's what 's called a tier 2 loan . In tier 2 , the max LTV on a supplemental - is 70 % of the new value . - _ . Also , just saw a 76-unit CDL 80k . No , no , no . Yeah , no . I 'm not sure where we got 470k . Our everyday life is filled with chores and errands that people 100 , even 50 years ago couldn 't comprehend . Moses saw the burning bush . The disciples had to tell people that they saw Jesus rise from the dead . And Mary had to tell her husband that she was pregnant even though she was still a virgin . That 's a tall order . Sometimes God makes us witnesses to the unexplainable . Imagine carrying the burden of having experienced an impossible event . Could you , could I ? I don 't know . Most of us will never be tested in that way . But those that we celebrate today , they held firm . They never wavered , even when those around them wouldn 't listen . That 's courage . That 's faith . - Metal ? - Metal ? - What you mean , Metal " ? - Like a microphone . It was metal ... perfectly shaped , like a little circle . Alien technology . They put it in his head . The doctor didn 't know how it got there or what it was . Dude , you admitted yourself it was alien technology ... in the room , after surgery . I don 't remember that . I mean , I was pretty high . It was like Snoop Dogg , Willie Nelson , Wiz Khalifa barbecue high . No , you said it . I was there . And you said you were gonna write a book about it , and that I was your best friend . Okay , Gerry , please don 't put words in Ozzie 's mouth . - Okay ? - What , I 'm not . People do crazy things when they 're high . I took generic feline Ativan last year , and I bought five pairs of jeans online . Okay , I ... okay ... Where is the metal now ? Where is the metal ? A nurse walked away with it . We think a nurse took it . - Reptilian ? - It was a nurse . I don 't even go to doctors . Ozzie , how are you feeling ? Can ... can you describe how you 're feeling ? Sure . Yesterday there was something in my head , and today there 's not . So I guess I feel pretty okay . Dude , just admit it ! It was aliens ! Calm down . You said it ! It was alien technology ! Just ... just ... just say it ! You admitted it before . We 're not leaving till you say it . You know what , leave us out of it , okay , Gerry ? - We weren 't there . - Okay , you know what ? Fine . - I 'll say this ... - Yes . Something happened to me , and it was unexplainable . And ... sure , why not ? It could have been aliens . Fine . We can check this one off in the box - for the alien-believing column . - All right ! But it also could have been the tooth fairy , because we have no physical , actual proof . Whatever . I 'll take it . I called you seven times . - Where were you ? - It 's been a very busy day . - Did you find the car ? - No . What do you mean " No " ? You had all day . You ... you answer the phone when I call you ! You hear me ? ! Wha ! Loser , loser , winner , winner ! Here 's your trophy .

 INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION MARS PILGRIM , 7th MISSION , DAY 1 This is Dr Miranda North , Quarantine Officer aboard the International Space Station . Today the Pilgrim capsule with it 's valuable Mars Soil samples ... completes it 's 8 month return from Mars . Preparing to receive these samples ... has been the purpose of our mission these last few months . But the Pilgrim capsule is damaged . At 06 : 30 UTC ... Pilgrim was struck by debris and veered off course Rory Adams will space walk to establish visual contact with the incoming space capsule and he 'll grab it with the remote arm . We have been waiting a long time for this sample and Rory is placing himself at great risk to secure it . - Over and out . UME . - 4.7 psi , pure O2 . So how you gonna do it ? - I wouldn 't do it that way . - Dr. Jordan , that 's your best defence ? - Faster ! Nitrogen is zero . - Dr. North ? - In the airlock . Rory , slow to go fast . - Or fast to go fast . - Deliberate . - We 're here to get fast . Remember , 8 billion people . Rory , if you can 't save it ... Spoiler alert . I 'm fucking saving it . If you can 't , just push the capsule into deep space , OK ? Do you hear me ? Can you get OCD , sorry - CDC , out of my face ? I got a big operation . I need to concentrate . - I just wanted ... - I can 't hear you . I love you too . - EMU at 4.7 psi . - Where is the remote ? Here . The arm is yours . Full manual . - Let 's go ... Careful with ... - Sorry , you know this . - No more sorries . - Miranda , to the cupola , please . - David , are you on your way ? - I 'm on my way . - Slow , Sho . - Excuse me . How do you say " breathe " in Japanese ? This was supposed to be a routine . Air lock is sealed . I am walking . 04 : 35 UTC . After striking debris , Pilgrim non-responsive . Inbound on a collision course with the ISS . Initiate emergency course correction and manual retrieval . Cannon arm online . Transferring control to wireless . Station to Control . Initiating sequence . - So the committee ... ? - You let me worry about the committee . Where 's Rory ? - He is at risk out there . - Easy folks , mics are live . - Ready , Sho ? - sThrusters up . Holding in position . I have control of the arm . Your worry lines are showing . Yeah , well , I get paid by the line . - I have a good feeling about this . - Yeah ? - Rory is gonna deliver that sample . - Right to your lab . Prepare for course correction . .052905 .076 Remember your training . - We never trained for this . On my mark . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . - New capsule trajectory , negative 0.50 . - Proximity alert . Ignore the proximity alert . New station trajectory : negative 0.32 . The capsule will miss us , just . - Rory ? - I still don 't reach . It 's coming in shallow . Any moment now . 8 , maybe 9 clock . I 'm having fun . You guys having fun ? Rory ... - if you miss ... - Yeah , yeah , yeah . And ... Just gonna skip off the atmosphere like a flat stone on water . Just fly off into nowhere , no harm done . Okay . There ! - There . - I see it . Here we go . This is fun . Rory , you have to move , it 's gonna hit you . - That 's bad . Please Rory , move . Station to Control . Visual confirmation of Mars Capsule Pilgrim . I used to play catcher , but only in T-ball . - Rory ? - Not now . Not now . Come here . Come on , come on , come on ! Rory ? Rory ? He caught it ! Yo ! Cue Instagram ! I don 't wanna jinx it . - Point and shoot , motherfucker ! - Okay . Mars Capsule in lock position . I 'm coming home . This is mission commander , Ekaterina Golovkina . Tell the committee , Pilgrim 's landed on Plymouth rock . The Mars samples are safe sound . Copy that , Commander . Congratulations . ISS PILGRIM 7 Ready ? We are recording . 06 : 40 UTC . Pilgrim wasn 't just seeing things in the Mars soil . We are looking at a large single cell ... Inert . Unmistakably biological . And like organisms on Earth , it has what appears to be a nucleus , cytoplasm ... The cell wall is thick . Those hairs look like cilia - longer than we 're used to seeing on Earth . More like flagella . - What 's the temperature ? - Minus 110 . Start bringing it up . Minus 82 . Even quicker . Minus 55 . This is some Re-Animator shit . That 's very obscure reference . - Not for a nerd . - Not if you 're a nerd . Minus 17 . - Zero degrees . - Oh come on . 18 ... 19 ... 20 degrees Celsius . Nothing . Update ? I 'm gonna try a different atmosphere . Closer to Proterozoic Earth than today 's Mars . Less oxygen ... more carbon dioxide . And then when Sho is ready ... a growth medium . In this case , glucose . Come on , dance . Did it just move ? Hugh ? My God . It worked . You woke it . We are looking at the first incontrovertible proof of life beyond Earth . Oh , it 's beautiful . Our first question is from Allen . He is 9 years old . And Allen , what is your question for Commander Golovkina ? Is it green ? It 's not visible at all actually , it 's microscopic . A single cell . To put it into perspective , your body is made up of trillions . There is an alien inside of me ? I bet your teacher sometimes thinks so . We have another question from 8 year old Marrie . Are you bringing the alien back to Earth ? No , we are gonna keep it up here . We 're gonna study it where it 's safe . Commander ? The ISS is the most expensive house ever built . 200 billion American dollars and counting because we keep adding rooms . It flies around Earth 16 times a day . In 30 years , over one hundred people have lived here ... thanks to generous countries like Russia , the USA and China . We call this Tranquility node . Dr. Jordan here is about to break the record for consecutive days on space . 473 straight . Your mommy must miss you . She does , but I have family here . Yeah , the kind that teases him 'cause his mommy misses him . This is one of our newest crew members , Miranda North ... From the Centers for Disease Control . She is a doctor too . You guys are witnessing a space triathlon . Yeah , I 'm winning . We have another question from 7 year old Layla . We think this question is a little personal . - Go ahead . - How do you go to the bathroom ? Funnel . Tube . And some suction . Everything we do on the ISS is like everything you do on Earth . - Except different . You like peas ? - Yeah . Have you got a name yet ? - For that we wanna go down live ... just outside our studio in Times Square , to one very brave class mate . - Hi , Dominique . - Hi . Calvin Coolidge Elementary ... was chosen among 11,000 schools ... for this honor . We name the Martian ... after our school . " Calvin " . Control ? Control ? If you 're listening , and you probably are cause you 're creepy that way ... Can I rant for a second about the micromanagement ? We are not blood filled human puppets . I come from a long line of plumbers . I can fix a shower . If I can 't , well , Hugh doesn 't shower anyway . He 's British . First international incident . You 're just a very underpaid nation , everybody knows it . - Don 't be an ugly American . - Wow , who 's ugly now ? I nailed Step 17 . I am a very good looking American . Oh , I see , it 's right there . - Control , sorry about him . - Control can 't hear you . I do not know where rage like that comes from . Can you please just fix the shower ? I can do this myself . No , I know . You just haven 't . Doctors are always so bad at looking after themselves , aren 't they ? You 've spent too much time up here . Your atrophy has accelerated . And you 're close to radiation limit . You noticed any ... glowing in the dark ? I like it up here . When I was in the military , we go to Syria . You know . We set up a hospital . Treat all the casualties , and then ... We come back a week or two later , and ... The whole village would just be bombed out . That Earth isn 't all Syria though , is it ? Can 't stand what we do to each other down there . But it 's home , and it 's beautiful . Don 't you miss anything ? Don 't you miss fresh water , or birds , or ... the trees ? I like the hum up here . And the air . What you 've achieved with Calvin is remarkable , Hugh . I haven 't had a chance to say that . Thank you . I think these will prove to be greatest days of my life . I wish I had a time machine so I could visit the 10 year old me . Did he want to be an astronaut ? He wanted out of the wheelchair . And how does he feel now ? Like a bird . Don 't get me wrong . I don 't hate the chair . I love it . For the sake of the anonymous genius who invented it . You 're one of a kind , Hugh . Goodnight . PILGRIM 7 - 11 : 20 UTC . - Hold on to your helmets . The glucose intake is very rapid . The specimen 's cells have began to move together en masse as a unit . And they 've also shown electrical activity , in what resembles a growing neural network . Notice I didn 't say " brain " . Dr. North speaking . It 's our educated opinion that this new species , it is not a colony of fast dividing single celled organisms ... but one larger solitary organism composed of ... trillions of identical cooperative cells . Here 's what 's fascinating ... I mean , it 's all fascinating , isn 't it ? Unlike most multi-cellular organisms , every cell of Calvin 's can perform every somatic function on its own . Every single cell is simultaneously , a muscle cell and a nerve cell ... and a photo-receptive cell . So the creature as a whole ... is , in a very real sense , all muscle all brain , all eye . As such , Calvin now possesses the means to interact with its environment , including the use of what appears to be proto-appendages . I 'll demonstrate . I notice how it 's approaching and not retreating . Its curiosity outweighs its fear . That is beautiful . Hello , Calvin . How does that feel , Hugh ? You 're gonna be a daddy . It 's gonna be a big custody battle over this one . You can do this , Kazumi . I 'm doing my best . It 's coming . Any moment now , okay , push . Easy for you to say . You can do it , Kazumi . You can do it , you can do it . Sho ... - Yes . I can see it . - Its okay . Push . You 'll be able to meet Mei soon . You can do it . " And that there was more of it during the night . We can observe , too , how the recollection of a dream , which was still lively in the morning , will melt away , except for a few small fragments . This book doesn 't have pictures in it , does it ? Obviously not . Would you prefer that I don 't read it out loud ? Guys , guys . Meet Mei . Hi Mei ! - Say hi to everybody , Mei . - Hi Mei ! - She 's beautiful ! - Congratulations ! - Thank you . " Nice to meet you " . - You have any idea who the father is ? - Shut up . - Another one ! For story time . It was my favorite . You might say , my first foray into space . - Thank you so much . - Thank you , Commander . - Thank you guys . - She 's beautiful , Sho . Thank you ! Seriously , that kid had blue eyes . EEI PILGRIM7 MISSION , DAY 25 It 's the lab . - Miranda , check the O2 in the lab . - Level 's on 21 . Clear for contamination . We 're okay . Calvin is safe . I don 't understand how this happened . Nothing in that lab can malfunction . The clamp . It failed . It 's on me . No shit it 's on you . A 5 year old could 've spotted that . Protecting these firewalls - yes , that 's my job but I can 't do it alone . Kibo wasn 't designed for strict firewall lockdown and neither was the station . There is zero precedent for any of this . But you do not come out of that lab without triple checking everything . You don 't go in that lab without a proper rest . For all I know , we 're carrying Anthrax on board . You can 't compare Calvin to Anthrax . I know at least five guys back home that can do my job . Nobody can do yours except you . I don 't want to be around that thing . I am not qualified to be around that thing . I understand . I 'm just saying you can 't compare Calvin to Anthrax . You don 't know what that thing is . You 're playing around like it 's your buddy . I 'm your buddy . You 're drunk on this . Wake up . This isn 't and will never be a controlled experiment . So let 's all agree we made our first and last mistake . I miss my fucking dog . Goodnight . Dr. Miranda North , quarantine officer , 23 : 20 UTC . After weeks of stunning growth and activity , Calvin is completely inactive . We believe it 's likely due to the clamp failure in the lab , which caused a temporary change of air pressure in Calvin 's box . Our working theory is that this hibernation may be a defense mechanism . Everyone here is on edge . Hugh of course has been beating himself up , but honestly I 'm relieved . Calvin was growing very fast ... and this has given me time to reinforce firewall precautions with the crew . The box must stay sealed , the lab must stay sealed . No matter the risk to Calvin . It 's just floating . Because of my mistake ... in the lab . And it was going so well . What ? Something my dad used to say . " It was all going so well . " I 'm toying with the idea of stimulating it electrically . What you think ? - That 's not my call . - But if it were ? I don 't know . My job is lines of defense . Imagine the worst thing that could happen ... and then the worse after that and worse after that , and then I ... I planned for all of them . I understand that . But risks are taken for reasons . Because of Calvin , we can learn so much about life . Its origin , its nature , maybe even its meaning . - I know . - You 're a doctor . Stem cell research . What if Calvin can make stem cells obsolete ? Help cure the incurable ? Reverse the irreversible ? I have to fix this . Good . You ready ? - Stretch . - Okay . And ... relax . Ready . - You sure it won 't hurt it ? - It 's a very very low voltage . We 're only stimulating it . - What exactly are you hoping for ? - I 'm hoping to wake him up . We 'll see under what conditions it reengages with its environment . C 'mon in . Shocking the monkey . Trying another spot . Nothing . Not even at the cellular level . Are you sure it 's not ... dead ? It is alive , just in a deep sleep . Oh , c 'mon , Calvin . Wake up . Shit ! - What 's wrong ? - It broke the wand . I 'm gonna try to pull my hand out . You can do that but make sure to protect the glove . - Shit . - It 's gripping the glass . Okay . Okay . Little son of a ... - How hard is he holding on to you ? - Like a firm handshake . Funny , it doesn 't hurt , but it 's damn strong . - What 's the problem ? - He 's got Hugh 's hand . His heart rate is at 165 . - Sho . Can we trust the glove ? - It 's very tight . The glove is not going anywhere . It 's fine . - Shit . - Okay , just relax . Tell him to relax . Derry ? Look at me . Relax . Just relax your hand . It 's in between my fingers . Can I make a suggestion ? Can I go in there and take it out ? No , you 're not going to go in there . No . Of course you 're not . Because I 've to maintained quarantine . I can . I can do it . - Can you try and distract it . - Yes . I 'll see if I can interest it in the wand . Go on , my favorite little muffin . C 'mon . C 'mon . He lost interest . He 's got hold of my hand . Hugh ? Hugh ? Hey , Hugh ! - What the fuck is going on ? - No one is going in ! - C 'mon ! - Wait ! - Who 's going in ? Waiting for fucking what ? Don 't do this ! I don 't give a shit about your fucking quarantine ! Who gave you this jurisdiction ? Just open the door ! Wait , wait , wait ! He 's out . He 's out . Guys , look at it . Oh God . Jesus . - What are his vitals ? 126 and dropping . What 's it doing ? Holy shit . Jesus Christ . Okay . You guys got eyes on it anywhere ? Hey , there . There . Guys ? - Fuck this ! - No ! - Let him go . - Hey buddy . Watch his hand . Get him ! Adamsss ! - Yeah . - David , I need you here . Rory ... I can 't let you out . Oh ... shit . - Hugh , Hugh ? - That 's . - Look at me . - Let me see , yes ? Guys ? - Suggestions ? - Get the oxygen candle ! Burn it off ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . Fuck . Okay . Alright . What now ? How do we get him out ? We need to get Calvin back behind firewall 1 . Once he 's there , we can pull Rory out . Fuck this . Permission ... to fucking kill the thing . Commander ? Kill it . Sho ? Any suggestions ? - What about the incinerator ? - I like that . Alright . Genuis . Close the red valve . Disengage the clamp . Disconnect the hose . - Be careful , Rory . - Fuck ! There is limited fuel . - Manual override . - Thank you . Okay . Rory , I ... Yeah . Fuck ! You 're wasting too much fuel . Rory ! Rory ? Hey ! Rory , stop , stop ! Rory ? You 're out of fuel . It 's behind you ! Jesus ! Fuck ! Somebody open up the fucking door ! And pull him out ! Just open up the door ! The thing is strangling Rory . What is he saying ? Rory , Rory ? - Kat ! We gotta open the door ! - Do not ! It is the protocol ! Fucking protocol ! Just open the door ! There 's a man dying in there ! Guys ? Guys . Sho ... It 's so much bigger . Jesus ! - Guys ? Guys , it 's trying to get out . - Sho . - The CPU overruled us . - It 's searching for a way out . - The system won 't give me access to it . - Go manual . Shut them down . Okay ? - How smart is this thing ? - It feels the air flow . - I can 't control them all at once . - Then shut them one by one . Seal the lab ! - Shut it down . Shut it down now ! - We 're on it . Guys , it 's gone . - It got out . - Where did it go ? Could be anywhere now . Firewall 2 has failed . Kat ... We need to re-establish quarantine . I will get a distress call out . Control , this is Station . Station to Control . The specimen 's location is unknown . It is to be considered hostile and deadly . Our intent is to isolate and destroy it in compliance with protocol . We will continue said course of action unless otherwise instructed . Please acknowledge and advice . Kat , we lost them . - How much of that went out ? - Some ... I think . There is no way to be sure . Looks like communications just failed . Can we talk to each other ? David ? It 's Kat . Do you copy ? Gos for David . - Still , we 've lost contact with Earth . - I dont think ... Wait . - Yes , outside communications are down . - Could the sprinklers affect comms ? No . They are independent systems . Can we run a diagnostic from here ? The transmitter has failed . But , we have to go outside to access it and get Earth back online . Then I have to walk . Let me . No . After Rory , I 'm best qualified for walk and repair . This is not protocol . It 's way too risky for you go out there to fix the comms . We don 't know where Calvin is . Haven 't had your Nitrogen detox . Your health is my responsibility . - I 'll be fine . - Yup . What is it you say ? " Slow is fast " , right ? Yeah . " Slow to go fast . " Well , that 's out the window . We can escape in our lifeboats . Earth is the responsibility . Nothing goes down to the planet . It was stipulated in writing . What are you talking about ? What was stipulated in writing ? What was stipulated ? David , first things first . When we 're back in touch with Control , we 'll turn our attention to Calvin . Don 't worry . Rate : 61 beats per minute . Pressure : 97 / 53 . I 'd hate to see you relaxed . But she is relaxed . Aren 't you , Kat ? Suit 's running warm . Like Siberia in summer . I 'm at the transmitter . Commencing on site diagnostics . It overheated . I can tell . How ? It 's scorching . I will pitch up the coolant levels . Is it possible Calvin could 've gotten into coolant ? - Possible . - We have to know . - There is the issue . - Commander ? It 's bone dry . Calvin is a carbon-based organism . It needs food , water , and oxygen . Just like us . We have to consider the possibility it consumed the coolant for food . David , could you list all the water sources aboard ? Pure or otherwise . There is plenty of drinking water . There 's coolant for the comms , coolant for the CPU ... and there is coolant for the ... Commander ? Calvin just came out , then grabbed to my suit . It 's bigger . - It 's trying to get in . - Trust your suit . - Can it breathe out there ? - No . But it might be able to store oxygen for a period of time . I 'm closing the valve . - It 's squeezing . - Kat , Kat . Are you okay ? Yes . The suit is thick enough . It 's twisting up your leg . Go , go to the airlock now . Fuck this . I 'm headed to the airlock . I 'll burn this fucker off ! Kat . Focus on meeting David . We will worry about the comms later . Sho ? There is liquid in the helmet . Calvin must have broken my coolant tube . - Kat , there is enough coolant ... - Yes I know . I know . David ... - Meet me at the airlock . - What ? Yeah . Go , go ! It 's is squeezing harder . Calvin cracked the cooling system in her suit . Commander . Calvin knows exactly what he is doing . It 's growing smarter . The liquid is blocking my vision . I don 't have time . I 've got to jump . - Kat , the tether won 't reach . - I 'm unclipping . Kat ? - No comments . I 've got to jump . David , I 've taken care of the channel . She is not gonna tell you , but her heart is beating out of her chest . She is drowning . So just be prepared she may not be rational . Sho , I got no time for EVA . Using the launch suit . It 's not designed for this . There 's not enough protection . - I know , don 't worry . - Kat has less than a minute left . - Check the airlock ! - What about decompression ? - Do it ! - It 's gonna hurt . - Do it ! - Your helmet sealed ? Guys , we 're running out of time . Kat , Kat ... Don 't swallow . It 's toxic , okay ? I need you to help me open the valve . We 'll do it together , okay ? I 'm gonna pull down , and you 're gonna go clockwise from your side . Okay ? There you go . Good , good good . Do not worry about Calvin . We are gonna get you inside and get it off . Kat ? No , clockwise from your side ! Clockwise from your side ! Kat , come on ! - Miranda ? - Yeah , I 'm here . She 's fighting me ! She 's turned the lever the wrong way ! Hold ... Kat , you 're fighting me ! Kat , come on ! We gotta do it together now ! Come on ! Kat , come on , please ! Look at me ! Kat ! Just pull on the lever , okay ? Kat , come on ! Come on ! Just pull down on the lever ! Kat ! Come on , you can do this ! David , she 's doing it deliberately . Come on ! Kat ! - Kat ! - David , stop . Stop . She is not letting Calvin back in here . Kat .. Commander .. Kat . What 's going on ? What 's going on ? Guys , guys , do you copy ? - Yeah , yeah I copy . - Okay , okay ... Just keep it together . We may have an opportunity here . Calvin 's ability to survive in that vacuum and temperature is astonishing . But it can 't live much longer out there . Sho ? Are you sure that we 've lost all communication with Earth ? I am sure . Alright then . We have to keep him out there . We have a new firewall . David . Can you see it ? I 'm seeing , um .. Sho ? - Yes . - Can you re-flood the airlock ? You tell me when . Okay . Did she close that valve ? Yeah , she closed it . What are ways he can get in ? The thrusters . The manifolds in the thruster nozzles . If he tries one , we could blast it off . But we 'd have to know which . It 's too dark . I can 't see anything . There must be some way . Thruster sensors . If it climbs in the nozzle , the temperature should move . Should . Alright . - There ! - Thruster 2 . Firing . Miranda , can you reach Tranquility ? We missed ! Cut it ! Guys , it 's heading toward ... No ! It 's heading towards the lab ! - I 'm sorry , guys , I can 't see . - It 's okay , we 'll watch it . - Kibo . - Thruster 3 , firing . Come on ! Please ! - Thruster five ! David , can you see it ? - Thruster five . Sho ? CRITICALLY LOW FUEL - What was that ? - We 've burnt through too much fuel . We were already low after the Pilgrim . Doc , listen . All this thrusting ... We 've placed ourselves into decaying orbit . We 'll reach atmosphere soon if I don 't get us back to stable . And I need the rest of the fuel to do it , if we even have that much . No . David ? We can 't risk Calvin riding us down into the atmosphere . I don 't know if it could have survived it . We don 't know . It has already gone well beyond what any living organism should be able to survive . If it 's between letting it in here , or letting it down there .. We let it in here . Where are you ? We 've just let it back in here . Moving us back into stable orbit . These creatures could have dominated Mars for hundreds of millions of years . But now we know that they hibernate for the loss of atmosphere . If we deprive it of air , retreat to Tranquility and seal ourselves off ... And vent the rest of the station ... Exactly . No life support - no life . Right . OK , Hugh and I will sweep from quest east . And ... You and Sho scout the poles and lock off each compartment . This will take about ... 4 hours to vent all oxygen . - What do we do till then ? - We wait . You okay ? Derry , look at me . You 're okay ? I 'm fine . I remember the day the Challenger blew up . They took us out of school early ... I remember that day . It 's hard to watch people die . Like ... Fireworks . Up , up ... A long , delirious , burning blue . I topped the windswept heights with ease and grace . Best eulogy ever . Rory says : " Don 't give me an eulogy ... " " Give me a parachute . " He was my buddy . It 's my fault . It 's all my fault . Maybe it was your fault , maybe it was my fault . Maybe ... It doesn 't matter , does it ? Getting this thing onboard was a risk and we knew it from the beginning . We took it . It 's just surviving . Life 's very existence requires destruction . Calvin doesn 't hate us . But he has to kill us ... in order to survive . Hugh . - Hugh . - Wait . Quiet . Hey , Hugh . It 's fine . Sorry because all the ... Hugh ? There is no output . Get the defib . - Help him right . - Okay . - Get him down . - I 'll strap him in . - Take off the sling . - Okay . Sho , get me ACLS kit and the defibrillator . Hugh . Here . Prep the defibrillator , get the shocks now . - 360 joules . - Copy 360 joules . Charging . Clear . - Charging . - Still defibrillator in . Just set the shocks to the highest . Go , 360 . Clear ! - Nothing . - Go again . 360 . - Go Again , hit him . - Clear . Alright , alright . Okay , output . Yeah . OK , sinus rate : 98 beats pm . You really scared me there , buddy . David ? David ? - What is this ? - Stabilizing . - Get the plasma cutter . - Calvin 's feeding off his leg . Go . Get out of here . - Let 's go ! - Come on ! Miranda , let 's go ! Pull away from Hugh , Sho ! - We 'll come back for him ! - Miranda , let 's go ! Sho ! No ! - Sho ! - No ! Guys ? - Calvin ? - We don 't know where he is . - Where is Sho ? - He 'll be fine . We stopped all oxygen venting in the station . Lift me up . Oh ... Miranda . Up , up . I 'm coming home , Mei . You know what I feel is not scientific . It 's not rational . I feel hate . I feel pure ... fucking ... hate for that thing . Calvin . How is that moving like that ? He must have swallowed the marker on Derry 's leg . Yeah . We can track it . Let 's kill this thing . Lifting " Zarya " now . It 's suffocating . How long do you think that 's gonna take ? I don 't know . Proximity alert . They 're coming . Kat 's distress call must have reached Earth . Right , where are they docking ? - Shit . Looks like " Zarya " . - Jesus , that 's where Calvin is . Station to " Soyuz " . Station to " Soyuz " , do you copy ? Station to " Soyuz " , do you copy ? - Station to " Soyuz " , do you copy ? - Try the flashlight . Come on , come on ! They can 't see this . Must be too reflective . - Shit . What the fuck are they doing ? - David . David ! They are not coming to rescue us . - It 's firewall 3 . - What ? Firewall 1 was the box . The firewall 2 was the lab . The firewall 3 is the station . - We have a new firewall . - They don 't know that . And if firewall 1 or 2 fail , they have two choices . They can contain ... or they expel . They 're pushing us out to deep space . They cannot risk Calvin reaching Earth . It was my protocol . I insisted from the beginning , and the committee agreed . They all put their names to it . The list is as long as your arm . Look , protective firewalls is my job . And if we would have succeeded , we could have gone home . And if we fail ... Wait for me , Mei . Sho . He thinks it 's a rescue . God ! He 's heading towards Calvin . Sho ! Sho , can you hear us ? Sho ! Sho ! Take my hand ! Don 't let go , Sho ! No , don 't let go ! Let go ! No ! Sho ! Miranda ! Miranda ! The CPU is still up . It 's a miracle . We 're ... We 're losing life support . The temperature is dropping rapidly . Atmosphere 's venting from everywhere , and I don 't know how to stop it . - How much time do we have ? - In here ? Two hours , maybe an hour and 45 . I need a ... - What ? - Fuck . - Fuck . - What is it ? - What ? - We 're ... We 're not moving into space . The opposite . All that fucked up thrusting , we are decaying again . What ? Sho has a subroutine here . Without any correction in course , which we don 't have fuel for anyway ... We 'll hit the atmosphere in ... 39 minutes . We 're not gonna survive re-entry . But Calvin could . It 's so cold . GOOD NIGHT MOON . My father used to read this to me when I was a kid . Goodnight , room . Goodnight , Moon . Good night , cow jumping over the moon . Good night , light ... and the red balloon . Goodnight , nobody . I remember when I saw my first picture of Earth . And I asked my father where all those ... all those lines were . The borders . I really miss him . " Good night , Moon " " Good night , stars " " Good night , air " " Good night , air " Bait . Calvin needs oxygen to survive . With the O2 level so low in the rest of the ship , it will target oxygen candles . We can use them as bait . There are two lifeboats , A and B. Both set to default entry trajectory . You press the button , they autopilot themselves to the surface . Unless somebody ... somebody overrides them from the inside . I 'll use the oxygen candles to lure Calvin into boat A. I close the hatch , you press the button to give me full manual control . If I can hold the stick I can override the flight path . And I hold it long enough , it will avoid re-entry . - You fly it into deep space . - With .. With Calvin . Yes . Meanwhile , you get into boat B. You press the button . If there are no complications , it 'd take you back home . - No , we should lure Calvin together . - Come on , Miranda . - It doesn 't make any sense . - Why ? The lifeboats are meant for one person . And this has been your plan all along . To make sure that creature doesn 't get to Earth . - Then I should be Plan A. - No , I 'm the pilot . You 're Plan B.

This is Dr. Miranda North , black box recording , in case of death upon re-entry . The creature killed four of the six ISS astronauts with fifth , Dr. David Jordan , presumed dead , carrying it out into deep space . My five colleagues all sacrificed themselves to maintain the firewalls . Please , honor them for giving everything to this cause . Mars life forms should be considered hostile .

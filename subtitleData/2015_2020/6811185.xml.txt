Rosewood , bones and Lucifer . - What 's your name ? - Lucifer . Like the devil ? Only on fox . Previously on " second chance " ... Disgraced sheriff Jimmy Pritchard took his own life today . You 're the first to journey all the way back , to get another chance . I know you . You 're one of those rich computer twits . Otto recoded your white blood cells to fight the cancer in my blood . You brought me back to save you . He 's stronger than predicted . Why does he think he 's my father ? Because he is . He 'll accept who you are . You saw it . He 's almost there . - That 's the problem . If he accepts who I am , he 'll want nothing to do with me . No , my father never looked like that , so he can 't be . He isn 't . He isn 't , he isn 't . But he is . Mnh-mnh . He 's the best version of your father . His cells were recoded for optimal capacity . Physically , he is the best version . It 's me . I 'm back . For so long , the unrivaled high-tech leader spanning social media , hardware , and killer apps , Lookinglass has seen its price per share slip recently as always enigmatic chief technology officer Otto Goodwin has become even more reclusive . Lookinglass aiming to reassert itself in both the corporate IT , as well as the personal use market with the launch of its new operating system . A two-year product drought is ending today as Lookinglass rolls out its new operating system . Will this answer the question of what has Otto Goodwin been doing ? Will this new product be just what Lookinglass needs ? Mary Goodwin will appear on several national morning shows before officially rolling out the new product herself at the Lookinglass campus . As important as the new technology of the operating system is , what 's more crucial to the Lookinglass stock price is consumer confidence in the corporation itself . Can they remain relevant ? Lookinglass is down another 1 % off yesterday 's opening bell , continuing a slow and steady slide with sheer volume nowhere the numbers C.E.O. Mary Goodwin wants it to be . And add to this mix unconfirmed rumors that the lack of new products and innovations is due to an illness somewhere high up in the Lookinglass camp . It 's clear that today Lookinglass wants the world to know they mean business . You 've been a very patient board of directors , and today your patience will be rewarded . By tonight , investors will be assured that our company is where the smart money should be , that we are a good buy at this price because we 're only going up from here . I will see you all at the launch . Thank you . You think maybe one of them could smile every so often . It 's a big day . Were you able to sleep ? I wasn 't . Not a wink . Too excited . A little nervous . When do we leave for the first interview ? We should get in the car as soon as you 're done with your blood transfusion , which should be starting now . Or have you already done it ? No . Mr. Pritchard has not shown up yet . I 'm not sure where he is . We should push the interviews . No . We need to set the tone for today . Lookinglass and this announcement need to own the news cycle . If I cancel interviews , then that is what they will talk about . Your transfusion . You need it . It can wait until Mr. Pritchard returns from wherever he is . He 's probably doing something important . All-in . Guess this just ain 't your night . Never is . You remember this guy ? Yep . Real son of a bitch . You 're telling me . He 'd have had this figured out by 3 : 00 A.M. , though . See , my problem was , I was looking for one cheater when I should have been looking for four , right ? Hey . Everyone 's having a good time . No one likes a sore loser . One of you scratches your ear means you got Jacks or better . The other raises the pot till you fold , leaving me to fend for myself . Then what ? You guys , uh , you split the pot and then , well , I just go home , lick my wounds ? Time to start licking . I guess it 's just not your night . And today 's launch of the Lookinglass 9 phone is just the next step in that journey . Well , it 's been a while since the last product launch . Will we have to wait another three years for the next one ? I hope not . Look , Otto and I and everyone at Lookinglass really like to get things right . Why rush something into an over-saturated market ? After a while , people feel cheated if the product doesn 't match the hype . But with this , I can promise you that we 're ... I 'm sorry , Ms. Goodwin . If I could just interrupt you , we are receiving unconfirmed reports from several Internet news sources , and since we have you here , sources are saying that you 've been diagnosed and treated for anaplastic myeloma , an aggressive form of blood cancer , which is always known to be fatal . Ms. Goodwin ? You handled things brilliantly . Our stock is already dropping . Get the board of directors on the phone . Okay . Don 't bother . Hello , Craig . Yes , you and everyone else in America . Well , I 'm sorry , but I felt it was a very private matter . As a matter of fact ... Ms. Goodwin ! Hey , driver , slow down ! Hang on , ladies . We got photographers . Come on ! Just one shot ! One shot ! Hey , Mary ! Mary ! Over here ! Mary ! Mary ! This way ! Hey , Mary ! Yeah , right here ! Look at the camera ! Just one ... one picture ! Go , go , go , go ! All right , speed up ! You okay back there ? I 'm fine . I 'm sorry . You were saying ? It 's an unusually aggressive cancer , and recovery rates are very low . A diagnosis like this ... I say six months at best . Look who 's here . You 're mad . That 's a mad smile . Where were you this morning ? That 's not really any of your business . It 's been made clear to me that you do some kind of private investigative work . But here your primary purpose of business is a blood donor to Mary . You weren 't here . She missed her transfusion . So , yes , it is my business . Schedule a separate presser two hours before the launch . I 'll answer whatever cancer questions they 've got then . Okay , I get this wasn 't a day to miss a treatment , but if you 're mad at me , then just yell or something . And push the product team meeting to 3 : 00 in the conference room . Absolutely . Is this your version of the silent treatment ? You 'll be shocked to hear this , but not everything in this world is about you . Involved in a high-speed chase that ended with Ms. Goodwin 's car damaged and disabled on the shoulder of highway 35 , 4 miles south of Seattle . No injuries were reported , and as yet , no charges have been filed in the incident . You want to tell me about that ? Now a look at our forecast . Nothing for you to worry about . I 'm sure you have a lot on your mind . I said I was sorry . I didn 't ask for an apology . We have a problem . Actually , a series of givens , which , when factored together , create a paradox . Tell me . Givens ... " a , " you have anaplastic myeloma , which is now public knowledge . " B , " you discontinued traditional therapies months ago . " C , " the board of directors are demanding an examination to evaluate your current state of health . Mary . Sorry . Have you seen this ? Arthur . Display . What 's that ? It 's , um ... It 's a ... It 's a dead pool . What 's a dead pool ? A dead pool is a game of prediction which involves guessing when someone , most typically an elderly or ill celebrity , will die . Whoever picks the right day wins . Oh , no . This is bad . Someone bet on today . It 's almost time for my conference call , if you 'll excuse me . And it doesn 't matter how she dies . As long as she dies by midnight tonight , they win the entire pool . Why would they bet on today when it 's all over the media the doctors gave her six months ? Tell me about the car accident . Ms. Goodwin is here . Thanks , Owen . I 'll take it from here . Hell of a day , huh ? Yeah . It 's incredible you kept the lid on your cancer story as long as you did . It was bound to come out . I 'd rather it wasn 't on the same day we 're launching our new operating system . You know , maybe it 's good everybody knows . You can be honest with your employees and Wall Street . I appreciate your advice , but that 's not why I 'm here . So I take it you 're not here for a stress-reducing , therapeutic quickie . I 'm not . I 'm here about finalizing the merger . Our legal team 's been on it full time . They 'll have the deal papered by next month . And then if ... Then if your cancer wins , your company will be taken care of . If something happens to me today , I need to know my brother will be supported . Wait , is this about that dead pool crap ? I need to know you 'll take care of Otto . He trusts you . After me , you 're the only person he trusts . Promise me . I promise . I 'll take care of Otto . Thank you . And what about you ? You need help . I can take care of myself . So no therapeutic quickie ? I have a product to launch . I thought you were a multi-tasker . We were driving down the highway , and everything is normal . And then , all of a sudden , there are three cars speeding up on both sides of our car . And then this minivan , it pulls up on our right , and all of a sudden , it was like bam ! On the window . What are you doing here ? You sent me an urgent text . Why did you drag me out here ? He didn 't . I did . I used his name . Mary 's in trouble . We need help . You 've got help . Me . Your liability quotient is 4.7 . Out of ... ? 10 . Mary 's safety requires someone who is at least an 8 . Duval is an 8.5 . No . There 's no way he 's double what I am . Where you getting these numbers from ? Hey , thanks for the high ranking , but next time you 're in trouble , just dial 911 like every other taxpayer . Got to get back to my job now . Hey , hey . Are you still pissed about this whole C.I. thing ? Being a confidential informant is a smart move . Your boss was beginning to ask questions . You don 't want them finding out about ... About my working with the privacy-invading wonder twins and my dead-not-dead dad ? I mean , it 's a gray area . I get it . But it 's gonna make your life easier . Nothing about any of this makes my life easier . Whoa ! That was exciting . Was that exciting for anyone else ? No . Okay . Arthur and I gathered every available photograph that was uploaded from the accident . The images will advance every five seconds . You will be able to see each car in relation to Mary 's vehicle . See ? The minivan moving up right before it ran us off the road . What exactly are we looking for ? Otto , can you show us where the van passed Mary 's car ? We 're missing a sequence . The images of the minivan came from the photographer in the last car . For some reason , they weren 't uploaded . But I do have this ... That was even more exciting . Mary said there was an explosion when the tire blew . Maybe a gunshot . Someone is trying to kill Mary ? Yeah . There 's this thing . It 's called a dead pool . Now , a dead pool is this thing where they gamble ... I know what a dead pool is . Right there . The metal is scooped out smooth . See ? All along there . Huh . 9mm . Here 's another . It took at least two shots . Show us the van driver 's face . He doesn 't appear in any of the photographs . Whoever 's in the minivan , that 's your shooter . On the breaking news of Mary Goodwin 's cancer diagnosis , the price of Lookinglass stock has lost 8 % since the opening bell and looks to keep dropping as this day goes on . It 's not just the fact of her illness , but the fact that it was kept from board members and shareholders alike . She 's not canceling the launch . No . She thinks it 'll show weakness , so she 's insisting on going out in public . Where she 'll be a target . For once , you and I actually agree on something . Then stop her , Otto . Use that twin speak of yours . Tell her not to go . I tried . She won 't listen . For some reason that defies me , she connects with you . You have to talk to her . Make her stay home . Please . Someone tried to kill her . They 'll try again . I have 10 more minutes in here , then it 's all yours . Actually , I wanted to maybe show you a few moves , teach you how to defend yourself . I can defend myself . Yeah , against a bag . I 'm talking about street fighting . Now , listen , there are six basic moves . Those six ? Yeah , well , you know , three and five were a little slow . No wonder you 're sluggish . Not taking care of yourself . Out all night with women . There were no women . Mary , the real reason I 'm here is , we 've been talking , you know , Duval , Otto , Alexa . We 've decided that , uh , you 're not gonna do your presentation today . You decided ? Yeah . Someone wants to kill you , Mary , today . Someone ? Arthur , display the list . I run a high-profile company with millions of users and twice as many haters . We put out one update that doesn 't improve their lives instantly , I get death threats ! Kind of making my point for me , Mary . But why don 't you just postpone it one day ? Why ? So he can move his bet to tomorrow ? Or the next day ? Or the next ? Or you want to keep me in lockdown forever ? ! You may have called the shots when you were sheriff , but this is my company , my responsibility . I take my responsibilities seriously . Mr. Pritchard , are you feeling okay ? Just a little dizzy . It 's only been 12 hours since you 've been in the tank . I think I had too much to drink last night . I 've identified the paparazzi photographer who has the missing footage you 've been looking for . Can you track his phone for me ? I want to have a little talk with him . Of course . But perhaps I should alert Otto about ... No . I 'm fine . Just a hangover . Ah . The attentive car owner . Who are you ? I 've got a few questions about the Goodwin accident . You took a few pictures of a black minivan . I don 't think you uploaded them all , and I want to see them . Screw you . Okay . What the hell , man ? ! Well , it was either the car or your face . Did I make the right choice ? I said show me the driver . You 're showing me somebody 's arm . Take it easy . Look . A cobra tattoo ? I need a name . How should I know ? I 've never seen him before . He 's not one of us . Special agent Duval Pritchard . Leave a message and I 'll return your call at the first opportunity . Aw , a reunion with my poker buddies . Jared brought a friend . Look , guys , as much as I 'd love to spend all afternoon handing you your asses ... Again ... I 'm a little bit busy today , so why don 't you ... Oh , that should have done more . Agent Pritchard , can I help you ? I arranged to have myself assigned as lead agent on your death threat . That was a good idea . I 'm high profile . The FBI was going to send someone . And we can 't have federal agents digging around out here , can we ? It bothers you , keeping secrets . You mean from the bureau I swore an oath to ? Yeah , it does . But now I got to ask why . Your father has a rare genetic precursor that allowed us ... No , that 's how , not why . Your father never told you ? No . Otto recoded his white blood cells to fight off death . Now we 're using them to fight cancer . Your cancer . And if it continues to work , others , as well . So he comes back younger and stronger , lives in some architectural digest model home , drives that car , and he cures cancer ? So , where is this gift to mankind ? I have no idea . We had an argument . He stormed off . Classic . He 's probably at Peng 's halfway through a bottle of bourbon . Sir . Sir , can you hear me ? Sir , do you remember your name ? Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard . Get away from me . I got to find Mary , tell her about the cobra . Dumb idea , kiddo ! Why am I over there ? Sir , I-i think you just need to lay back and just relax , okay ? You 're in the stew now . Possible brain trauma , extreme disorientation . Let 's get a psych evaluation just in case . Yeah . You better pull it together . Quickly . I feel like hell . I feel like I 'm ... 75 years old again . Don 't you get it ? There 's something going wrong inside your body . And your little girlfriend 's in trouble , too . So you got to get out of here . She 's not my girlfriend . Whatever you say . I really need you to consider canceling this presentation . You have to , Mary . You have to cancel . I can 't . Our stock is cratering . If they don 't see me out there today , it 's all over . It 's too dangerous . You almost died this morning . Why risk it ? I 'm not risking it . You 're here . I appreciate that vote of confidence , but ... I 'll do it . If people need to see the face of the company , they can see mine . That 's not a bad idea . When you spoke with the nurse , you told her your name was , uh , sheriff Jimmy Pritchard ? The man who died recently ? Well , there 's dead and there 's dead . Do you ever feel depressed , worried , or anxious ? Nothing any good glass of bourbon wouldn 't fix . Could I just use your phone ? I 'm sorry . I can 't do that . Have you ever had feelings of wanting to harm yourself ? Others , sure . But myself ? I just need to get a message to somebody . Maybe you could just let me borrow it for a second ? Um , do you ever drink to get drunk ? Why ? How do you do it ? Or feelings of insecurity ? Is this really a job ? Can you just call the FBI , ask for my son ? Your son works for the FBI ? How old could your son be ? Just ask for agent Pritchard , okay ? Whoa , whoa . Take it easy . You 're blowing it . Just get a message to agent Pritchard , okay ? Tell him that the guy he 's looking for has a cobra tattoo on his left arm . Oh , boy . A cobra tattoo ? I know this sounds crazy . Well , we don 't like to use that word . Well , try " idiot . " Will you just shut the hell up ? ! I think a 24-hour observational hold might be advisable . This pooch is officially screwed . Finally . You get your ass in gear before they lock us up for good . What the hell 's happening to me ? I bet that egghead knows . Oh , no . I 'm never gonna make it . Stop whining . If you don 't get out of here soon , your girlfriend 's gonna be a goner , too . So get your ass up and call Duval . You need to tell him about the guy with the cobra tattoo . Will be starting in 30 minutes . Upon going through the security check , please follow directions to our main theater . Governor 's agreed to send another 100 state troopers . Maybe the extra security layer will be a deterrent . Maybe . But I 'm not taking any chances . I 'm coordinating with local law enforcement , making sure our comms are in sync . Good . All right , next in line . Cardiology attending to the ER , please . Cardiology attending to the ER Okay . Uh ... I should really learn to use one of these things . Uh , hello ? Mary , Otto , anyone ? Anyone read me ? Hello , sheriff Pritchard . Arthur , it 's ... it 's me ! I have established your identity and location . I have been scanning for your voice pattern . Tell Duval the guy he 's looking for has a cobra tattoo on his left forearm . I 'll communicate your message . And , Arthur ... I could really use a cab . You don 't have to do this . You know that , right ? This time ... I 'm gonna take care of you . Do I have to wear this tie ? You don 't have to wear this tie . Here to present the cobra9 operating system is Lookinglass founder and co-chairman Otto Goodwin . I , uh ... Uh ... Um , uh ... They 're uneven . It 's the banner . He 's stuck . He 'll fixate on the banner . Don 't ... I 'm sorry , Otto . I almost missed my cue . You all know that Otto and I lost our parents when we were very young . And since then , our family has been me , Otto ... And all of you . And I know that you 're now aware of the struggle we 've been going through behind the scenes for the past few months . There have been a lot of conversations about the future of this company . Suspect is a male with a cobra tattoo on his left forearm . Repeat ... suspect is a male with a cobra tattoo on his left forearm . But despite what you 're hearing everywhere , I am getting better . Lookinglass is growing stronger . I 've got eyes on target . Section three . And we are both going to be around ... You 've got a green light . Take him down . For a very , very long time . Get on the ground ! Don 't move ! Don 't move ! Search his backpack . Sorry . No dead pool payout for you today . This is Griggs , sector 6 . I have the suspect in custody , sir . I have a suspect , as well , sir . Cobra tattoo . I 've got one here , too . Here . It 's just their stuff . Nothing . They 're clean . All right . Who wants to explain the big meeting of the cobra club ? You . Start talking . I don 't know what 's going on . We work for Lookinglass . Who 's we ? We 're software developers . We designed the cobra system for the Lookinglass 9 . The messaging app . So we all got cobra tattoos . We just got a tip that someone with a cobra tattoo might be here today intending to kill Mary Goodwin . Is there anyone else on your team ? Malcolm . Malcolm who ? Sprague . Total dick . Halfway through the project , he just stopped showing up , so ... Ta-da ! Me . I replaced him . He was weird , angry . Not a people person , even for a coder . Malcolm Sprague filed six lawsuits against Lookinglass in the last year in the amount of $ 50 million for a copyright violation , breach of contract , pain and suffering , and personal distress caused by " the bitch Mary Goodwin . " I 'm pretty sure " bitch " isn 't a legal term . This is our guy . You 'll have the search warrant by the time you hit Malcolm Sprague 's door . Stairs ! Down ! We cheat everyone at Lookinglass . We 're using people , and I like it . Hi . I 'm Mary Goodwin , and I promise you I 'm going to lie . We cheat everyone at Lookinglass . We 're using people , and I like it . Hi . I 'm Mary Goodwin . That is seriously messed up . He 's been all alone with this anger . Nothing else matters to him now . Don 't scream . Just start the car and drive where I tell you . Malcolm , please , if you 're mad at me because I took your job ... My job ? You think I care about my job ? Mary took more than my job . It was the team , wasn 't it , Malcolm , that designed it ? They were my ideas . My mind . Me ! All right ? Now she 's gonna pay for it . Start the car and drive . Because of him , they identified the man who 's trying to kill me . The FBI 's searching for him right now . What 's wrong with him ? His endocrine system is failing . But the tank will fix that . It hasn 't so far . There 's a glitch in his code that the tank is not correcting . He 's shutting down . You mean dying ? Yes , dying . I don 't know why . My code was perfect , but there 's a glitch . I can 't fix it . I 'm worried , Mary . Are you worried ? Yes . But I 'm worried about him now . And what do we think if he dies ? Mary , a personal message was just posted to your Lookinglass page that I think you should see . Go ahead . You owe me for what you 've taken . And now I 've taken something of yours , one of your precious Lookinglass family . You 've ignored me , ignored my lawsuits . Then you go on TV and you wear your little white dress and you lie to the world . Go to the iron horse campsite , 30 miles off highway 61 at the Holston exit . I 'll meet you there . One hour . Come alone or she dies . One hour . Remember , wear your little white dress . I 'll make you a trade ... You for her . I can 't believe they 're actually doing this . Doing what ? They 're going to meet him , the man who wants to kill Mary . They 're really going to meet him . No , that 's crazy . We have to stop them . I mean , you need to stop them . I could stimulate you . But what if I kill you ? If you die , then Mary dies , it would be like I killed Mary . But if I don 't , then Malcolm could kill Mary . Arthur , calculate risks . Incomplete data set . Factoring givens , there is a 19 % chance for ... Otto , just do it . Okay . This is pure adrenaline . You 're going to feel a little kick . But please ... Don 't die . I 'll do my best . Hello ? Are you wearing the dress ? Yes . Good . You 're obeying . There 's been a change of plan . What ? You 're gonna be looking for an abandoned barn . Listen to me . I can pay you for your work and your time . Just let Kelly go . You do not have enough money to pay for what you stole from me . Malcolm , please . If you would like to see your precious employee again , you 're gonna do what I say . Okay . Get off at exit 2 . Go to the barn . This is Adair . Malcolm Sprague just made contact . He 's changed plans . He wants us to pull off a mile north off of exit 2 , an abandoned barn . Okay , we 'll shift resources down to you . Stay put until they arrive . Not sure we have time for that . Agent Pritchard ... Agent Pritchard ! Oh , no . You got to be kidding me . What the hell are you doing here ? I 'm here to help . That 's what I 'm doing here . How are you even moving ? Otto gave me this big needle of something . You thought I ran off ? Is that what he told you ? That I was on a bender ? What ? That I was at Peng 's ? Was that it ? You wrote me off , but now you need my help . So just ... just say it . Go on . Just say it . Just you 're happy I 'm here and you need my help . Just say it . Say it . Oh , for god 's sake . Just say it . Or we 'll never get out of here . I 'm glad you 're here . You . And we need your help . You 're welcome . Now let 's go . Otto says I 'm gonna pass out in about 10 minutes . Here . Put my vest on under your coat . My backup . This is my old service weapon . Your backup piece is my old gun ? Let 's not make a thing of it . Wasn 't gonna . All right . Sprague will want to be on high ground far enough way to make an escape . The sunset will be at his back , so he 's somewhere over there . " At 7 : 50 , walk towards the barn . " That 's in four minutes . Get in the car and keep the doors locked . Stay there until you hear from us . And if four minutes goes by and I don 't hear from you ? No safety . Just a long trigger pull . Just point and squeeze . She 'll do the rest . What about you ? Kind of want to get my hands on him anyway . Look , why don 't you stay here ? I 'll go up ahead . You don 't even got a vest on . Get behind me . You worry about yourself . I 'm fine . Where the hell is he ? I heard a shot . Are you okay ? Pritchard , Duval , are you okay ? It 's okay . It 's gonna be okay . Oh , god . I thought you were dead . You know , I 'm getting a little tired of you saving my life . You just saved my life . What ... what are you talking about ? I 've been carrying this around ever since I found out ... Who you were , deciding whether I should give it to you or not . It 's got a big dent in it . Yeah . If you don 't want it , I can take it back . No , no , I want it . I want it . Keep my gun , though . I like knowing that 's your backup . The glitch was impossible to predict because it did not exist in the subject 's original code . His genetic code is evolving . His own body 's rewriting it . We can expect there will be more changes . Otto , there is something else you should see . It 's about Mary . I need to say something . When you didn 't show up for my blood treatment and then when you stormed off ... I did not storm off . And then when you disappeared and then when you were half-dead and then suddenly you show up ... This is the worst apology ever . It 's not an apology . It 's just ... When I thought you weren 't there for me , it hurt , because ... I wanted you to be there for me . What do you think that means ? I think after 75 years , I know that when a woman asks me what I think something means , she knows what it means . Mary . The numbers from your most recent blood labs ... What about my numbers ? They 're improving . It 's not a cure . It 's not even full remission . But it 's the first clinical indication that the treatment is working . His blood is making you better . We need to go public with this . With the new cobra9 product launch and my numbers getting better , Lookinglass will be stronger than ever . Arthur , call Alexa . Mary . Mary ! And then get the board ... Listen to him . You 're alive . You 're not dying . At least not today . No , not today . And neither are you . You 've just watched second chance . Now here are a few more shows to check out from fox . What happened here ? Bad guys in this town are changing . I don 't know how bad it 's going to get . They think guns can stop me ? This is not a game . Troubled times . You ready to do this ? What grown man invites people to call him " Rosie " ? A secure man . There is a serial killer on the loose . We 're gonna catch him . You come at me again , the law won 't be able to keep me off you . - Thanks for keeping me in the loop . - I 'm looping you in right now . Okay , I forgot to put you in the loop . Rosewood .

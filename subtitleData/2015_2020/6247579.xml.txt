[ panting ] The power to the fence . Turn it back on . No one else has to die , david . You can still do the right thing . I 've dedicated my entire life to those people . Who are you to come in here And tell me what 's right or wrong ? You 're only here because i chose you - - both of you . [ abbies snarling ] What neither of you ever understood Is that this town is not about any one individual . It 's not about freedom . It 's about something much greater than that . It 's about the preservation of mankind . I have sacrificed everything To sow the seeds for its future , To protect it . Enlightenment is coming . My ideas will live on long after i 'm gone . No .

And , uh , at the risk of sounding redundant , I 'm better with more information . Nurse pam : Quite a sight , isn 't it ? What is all this ? The rest of the population , the ones who haven 't woken yet . [ beeping ] Careful . I might take you seriously . I mean it , kate . I 'm telling you the truth . You and i have never said one true thing to each other . Well , let 's start now , then , huh ? Nurse pam : If we are going to survive , We 're gonna have to make it better . No more lies . No more surveillance . No more reckonings . If we work together , I believe it is possible . I believe we can succeed . We have to . This is it . This is all that 's left . This is the last of humanity . Woman : Mr. Burke ? Mr. Burke ? [ monitor beeping ] Where am i ? Wayward pines , of course . Where is everyone ? Why are you dressed like that ? Uh , i 'm a nurse here now . Uh , i don 't understand . I graduated two months ago . I am more than qualified , mr . Burke . Why are you calling me that ? Graduated ? How long was i unconscious ?

Three years ? Ben , please . Please be quiet , okay ? They 're listening . After your accident , They put you back into suspension With the rest of the adults . I tried to get them to take you out earlier , But they wouldn 't allow it . They 're angry at your father . What ? They blame him for the savior 's death . They think you 're like him . But i told them , i convinced them ... You 're not like him . You 're different . Where are my clothes ? Ben , ben , wait , please . Where are my clothes ? Ben , they 're watching . And they will put you back into suspension with the adults . Amy , where are my clothes ? [ crying ] Ben ! Ben !

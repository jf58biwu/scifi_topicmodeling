 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... We 're being shot out of the sky . Daisy ! - Were you able to save Mack ? - I 'm so sorry . You saw it with your own eyes ... It 's a computer program . I don 't want to live in a world without Hope . Everything I need ... - It 's all right here . - What have I done ? Don 't blame yourself . The Framework messes - with everybody 's head . - No , no , but I ... I ... I killed people . And Director Mace . She 's not a robot anymore . Finally , you can touch the real me . Fitz , move ! There are actually a few funny passages in here . Has the little puppet finally made herself into a real girl ? I 'm tired of talking to myself . Fitz , move ! - Take the shot , May ! - Get out of the way , Fitz ! Just take the shot ! No . No , no , no ! She has Inhuman powers now ? ! Can we get a break , please ? ! Can we get one break ? ! Guess they weren 't assessing powers at Hydra as much as collecting them . Who even knows what Hydra was doing in the Framework . Wait . You do , I guess , right ? Sorry . I 'm ... having trouble sorting through the ... Two lives we lived ? You feel that , too ? Nice to see you again . Actual you . - We 're lucky we got out of there . - It wasn 't luck . You are only alive because I had restrictions put on me . Fortunately ... those restrictions have just been lifted . Who the hell is this guy ? Well , you missed a fair amount , May , but the quick version is , you can go ahead and shoot him . You are nothing now without a S.H.I.E.L.D. to hide behind . That 's not all they 're good for . Robots ... is that a common occurrence now ? Like I said , you missed a fair amount . It 's good to be back . How many hits have we taken ? - Three . - The Zephyr 's like a tank . - She 's holding together . - Yeah , but we had to pull the plug on everything except for flight control to keep the Framework - running for you guys . - So we can 't fight back . Or see where it 's coming from . Davis ! Try any evasive maneuver you can ! Not the only genius to think of that , thanks , but this thing also moves like a tank , so everybody get off my back . We need guns ! We 've got power now that these two are out , no ? We 'll head to the avionics bay and re-patch . Piper , are you up for manning the weapons ? I 'm offended you had to ask . - Is Mack okay ? - He 's alive , yes . What the hell happened ? Why didn 't you s ... - Not now , YoYo ! - Madre ! What do we do now ? Better hope Z-One can take a few more hits . - Who 's firing on us , anyway ? - We call him the Russian . 'Cause , you know , he 's Russian . Radcliffe teamed up with him for protection . After he replaced me with a robot version of myself ... - Just to clarify . - The technical term is " android , " but yeah . You remember any of that ? I remember getting hit in the head . Should 've stayed in that damn spa . You must 've spotted the decoy right away , right ? Yeah , ' cause you 're never robotic at all . Really ? How long did it take you to figure it out ? Wow . I 'm hurt , Phil . Guess we 're not as close as I thought . What finally tipped it ? A series of events . Didn 't get messy between us , did it ? Messy ? That 's a relative term , wouldn 't you say ? Okay . This ought to keep this door shut for a while . So , how did things end with Robbie Reyes ? Last I remember , we were chasing down his uncle . You know , guy tried to become a God , so we opened up a portal beneath his quantum-power cube , then Ghost Rider dragged him to another dimension with his hellfire chain . So , things ended well , then . Well as can be expected . Man , what a run . - After we escape this place , - Yeah . We 're definitely opening that bottle of Haig . Yeah , totally . Hey , but , listen ... Escape is not an option . Mack has to stay plugged in . If we wake him up , it 'll fry his brain . So we need to take control of the space . By force . I can barely stand . Yeah , well , hopefully , we won 't have to do it alone . Help should be on the way . The fire 's eating our oxygen ! We 're losing air , people ! Okay , if you can get the fire out , there 's a thick , black power cable that runs high along the wall to the avionics bay . I need you to tear that off the wall and drag it up here so that we can ... - Got it . - Well , okay , then . - Great . Now where do we plug this into ? - Over here . You 've got to be kidding me ! - Come on , Davis ! What are you doing ? ! - Prince , I swear , one more word from you , I drop the controls to kick your ass . Where is he ? ! Can you see anything ? No , Piper , I can only see what 's ... right in front of me . He 's right in front of us ! He 's heading straight for us ! Hey , hurry ! This guy 's going kamikaze ! Whoo ! Okay . Give Davis the coordinates of the oil rig . We need to get there A.S.A.P. Think about how confused our people are . Especially Fitz . He woke from the worst nightmare of all , one in which he was the monster . I had no idea . I 've only emulated human reactions , but to actually feel ... The warm sand ... The water rushing over me ... I feel like I 'm gonna throw up . I 'm sorry . You must be overwhelmed ... Two lives ' worth of memories . Only one type of person could do those things . You did what you had to do in order to survive the Framework . But it was a simulation . An illusion created by Radcliffe . You were there . Alongside me the whole time . Allowing h-horrific acts of violence to be carried out in your name . You 're implying I had a choice . I was a slave ... Programmed to make the adjustments Radcliffe required . The world changed from there . All I did was try to fit into it . No , you lied about everything . But I told you the truth about this world . Yeah , but ... but you ... You manipulated me . Every decision you made was your own . Besides restoring your relationship with your father , the only other change I made in your life was ... Introducing myself . First day of class at academy ... Befriending you , trying to understand what it felt like to connect with someone . But I wasn 't able to actually feel anything . Until today . Feeling ... Love , wonder , joy ... For the very first time , and I think my heart might burst from it . At last , I get to make my own choices , and ... And the first thing I choose , Leopold ... is you . It 's not that simple ! Then explain it to me . What stopped you ? - He was right there with you , no ? - Yes , but he didn 't want to come . You only bring back the people that matter to you , not to me ! You know what ? I 've known Mack longer than you , - and he means as much to me . - You promised ! You promised me ! I tried ! - He didn 't want to come back ! - Who cares ? ! You knock him over the head , you break his legs , you kick him through the exit ! It was a video game ! He didn 't want to leave Hope ! Hope ? His daughter ? You knew about her ? Because I didn 't . Not until I saw her face . She 's dead . Yeah , well , in there , she 's 10 . And she 's bright and adorable , and she means the world to him , even if it 's not a real world . I 'm sorry . He wouldn 't have left her for anything . Even me . He didn 't remember you , Yo-Yo . I 'm so sorry . Then I 'll go remind him . What ? No , no , no . No . Do not ... - I ' ll go get him out myself . - Do not do that . Besides the fact that going into that world as an Inhuman is the worst idea ever , we need you here , making sure that the real Mack stays alive , or it 'll all be for nothing . Coulson and May just woke up next to Mack with no idea where they are or what they 're up against . I know where we are , I think . In the ' 50s , the Soviets built top-secret submarine refueling stations under oil-drilling platforms . This might be one . You can tell from the one fish we 've seen , or did you learn that in a S.H.I.E.L.D. briefing ? Neither . I know from being a history teacher . I was kind of a Cold War buff . Can 't believe I 'm seeing this with his own eyes . Well , you almost make it sound like it 's good news . Not a lot of help here . We have saline , all the B12 we could ever need ... So we 're safe from a hangover . And Epinephrine . Emergency dose . That 's too dangerous . Might give me enough Adrenaline to take on some terminators . I 'll find a way to take them myself . I don 't want any - more bad to happen to you . - Me ? I got out unscathed . Jeffrey didn 't . He should be in here with us , still in the fight . I need to take one for the team . You 'll be useless afterwards , unconscious or unresponsive . Well , so you give me mouth-to-mouth . What 's up ? You mad that I was Hydra in there ? I don 't blame you for that . Then , what ? Did something weird happen with my robot self ? Did I make a move on you ? Phil , did I try to ... Kill you ? Kill me ... Yep . That 's what happened . You tried . It was messed up . Well , let 's add it to the list . Just make sure I 'm still breathing when the team arrives ? So , you can 't go any faster ? The only fuel left is in the center wing tank . And we burned all of our electrical power keeping you guys plugged into the Framework . So , no problem . Don 't mention it . But why didn 't you touch down at any point ? Recharge and refuel ? We should show them . Like I said , with an explosion that size , we still have a lot to sift through at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters . The entire area is sealed off , but , no , I can 't rule out Daisy Johnson 's involvement . Tommy ? It 's been playing on every channel . Sir , any truth to reports that Director Jeffrey . Mace 's body has , in fact , been found ? I have no new information about that , but I can assure you , the manhunt for the members within S.H.I.E.L.D. who remain at large is still our top priority . We can only assume that they 're behind this attack . Look , they 're terrorists , and we 're not gonna rest until we take them down and find out exactly who 's responsible . You thought this would make the transition easier . I knew you 'd be sorting through two lives , so ... I tried to please both . It 's a familiar space . But I thought we could decorate it together . It 's too much . I know . It was a silly idea . Sentimental attachment to objects was hard for me to understand . Until now . Now taste , touch , every sense gives me a rush . I 've felt your touch before . But now I get to experience the ecstasy you felt each time . Do you ... Do you have empathy ? Can you imagine how somebody else might feel ? I can . Especially you . How confusing this must be . So you can imagine how your actions could be perceived . You were ruthless . I was ruthless to win the heart of the man I love , the man you grew to be . My father 's son . I thought his presence is what you 'd have wished for . I 'm sorry . I was just programmed to make you happy . To make all of you happy . Who ? Radcliffe , our team , yeah . Who else is on that list ? No . What did you promise the Russian ? What 's waiting back there for my friends ? Hey . Well-done . You , too . Doesn 't make sense , though . Yeah . If they wanted to kill us , they could 've just flooded the place . Why were they stalling ? That 's all of it . Detach the submarine and launch the torpedoes . Shame . I will miss that place . Come on , stay awake . We need to find a way to the surface . Um ... And I haven 't been totally honest with you about what happened when you were not around . I knew something was up . What are you not telling me ? - I drank the bottle of Haig . - What ? ! You piece of ... We got to get to the surface ! - We can 't leave Mack ! - You 'll drown down here ! I 'll get you up top , then I 'll come back for him ! Come on ! Come on . They could be fighting for their lives . You need to go back and get them out of there . I-I-I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm having trouble thinking clearly , - an-analyzing the situation . - Okay . Hey . Hey , no , no . Don 't think , don 't think . What do you feel that you should do ? I don 't know . - I 'm scared . - Okay . Agent May had a gun , ready to kill me . I don 't want to die . I 'm afraid to die . But ... But ... But you feel compassion , yeah ? Because if ... If you really believe that you are capable of love ... And being loved . If you really believe that , that ... that ... That all the hurtful things you did were not your choice , make your own choice now . Do the right thing . Focus on empathy , - not fear . - Yes . Think ... Think about what they 're feeling , the people that you put in a life-or-death situation . Ophelia ... They don 't want to die , either . Please , save them . Where have you been ? I want you to call off your dogs . Leave the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents alone . I can 't wait to hear this . I 'm now realizing the pain that I 've caused , and I don 't want to hurt anyone else . Congratulations . You 're as close to human as you 'll ever get , suffering from the one thing that you kept trying to remove ... Regret . Do you understand irony yet ? 'Cause this is a good example . Give the order to stop ... Now ! You no longer control me , remember ? You are free to do whatever you want , but so am I. You promised me joy . This will bring me joy . - Don 't you have empathy ? - You watched , unaffected , as I took a hammer to the bones of the Director 's corpse . I couldn 't feel this then ! Now you are like an infant , unable to process these new emotions or the idea that you don 't always get everything that you want . And you have yet to experience the thrill that killing can bring . Maybe I 'll experience that now ... with you . Destroy this body , sure . It was designed only for killing . My head , which you severed , is controlling many of these machines now . And you don 't know where it is . So do what you want to this body . My plan is in motion . And nothing can stop it now . What happened ? What 's going on ? Perfect timing . Hi , everybody . She 's very weak . - And Mack ? - Down below . We have to keep him attached to the equipment so before we can wheel him o ... - Geez . You okay ? - Yeah . Go ! No more elevator . Where are the stairs ? They 've collapsed , too . You need to get off the rig now . Repeat ... The structure is about to crumble ! Guys , you need to get in the containment module - and in the air ! - No . You got to get in here before this rig down down ! No , I won 't leave without Mack , not this time ! There 's no time ! No ! We can 't leave without Mack ! - Yo-Yo , no , come on ! We got to go ! - No ! Get out of there now ! You have to ... You did it . You did it . Jemma ? I have Mack . Let 's go home . My God . Who did this ? You did . To stop him from coming after us . - Who ? - You . Looks like we weren 't detected flying in . We can 't stay long . Probably shouldn 't have come here . We have to refuel . Also , we had no choice . - Because of that room ? - It 's the only place that can contain Aida 's teleportation ability . It 's outfitted with technology we used to stop Gordon , the first guy we encountered with that particular skill set . She 'll remain inside until we can decide what we want to do with her . Why don 't we chop off her head like last time ? - You need a volunteer ? - Let 's take a moment and think about that , Sweeney Todd . - She 's a real person now , and she ... - She saved Mack . She made herself real in order to escape Radcliffe 's programming , so ... - Now maybe she 's different . - I highly doubt that . People don 't name themselves " Madame Hydra " if they 're open-minded . She did what you said in the Framework , - seems better safe than sorry . - No more killing . There 's been enough killing . Which leads to the next question . What do we do with Fitz ? What do the two of you remember of your Framework lives ? As much as I remember about this life . - The only difference is , I know ... - It wasn 't real . So it 's like you woke up from a dream . No . Not a dream , Simmons . A life . But this is you , right ? I mean ... Does it feel ... As real as ... She 's afraid Fitz will be the same guy he was in the Framework . No . She 's afraid he still loves someone else . Aida would 've categorized this as irony . But I see it as poetic . A simulated view ... My punishment ... Now that I can tell the difference . You did a good thing back there ... Saving Mack . Thank you . It was the best moment of my life . Do you think they 'll ever be able to forgive me ? Perhaps they ... they need to make me feel pain to understand theirs . They may be able to forgive you . It 's me they won 't forgive . They shouldn 't . We both did things we regret . I know you 're struggling with who you were in there ... No , I 'm not . I 'm struggling with who I am . I did those things , not some other man or a decoy . Me . It was learned behavior , programmed into you by an - overbearing father figure . - Just like Ward . I 'm just like Ward . How can she even look me in the eye ? Or even stand the sight of me at all ? How can she stomach it ? The memory of seeing me shoot that woman ... Um , you know , the reason I ... wanted to get closer to you in the first place was ... to try to understand what you two felt for each other ... You and Jemma . - And I finally do . - Yeah . What we felt ... Past tense . 'Cause my future with Jemma 's dead . Killed that , too . It 's okay . It 's okay . There isn 't room in my heart for two people . You were everything to me . I know . But as devoted as I was to you in the Framework ... I understand you better now . How deeply you love . You do understand me , don 't you ? Yes , Leopold . Now I do . It 's sad ... But beautiful . Like a ... A pain that ... feels good , - if that makes sense . - Yeah . You understand that my love will never fade . No , I know . Poor thing . You 're a romantic . And there 's only room in your heart ... For her . What ? What ? What do you mean " her " ? Listen ... - What about me ? - Yeah , no , I ... In ... I mean , in ... in ... in the Framework , you ... you were my whole world , - but ... - " But " ? But what , Leopold ? I just ... I only mean that ... - Jemma ... - No ! Okay . All right . Look , calm down , calm down . We 're just talking . This is ... This is a new emotion for you . No ! God . I clawed my way through that world , worked myself to the bone to have a choice ... To have bones and blood and freedom and love ! And ... No ! Okay , please , please ... Just ... just ... just ... Remember ... Remember that sensation you had about helping people earlier ? Let 's ... Let 's return to that mood . I chose you ! We need to extract Fitz from that room ! Hands in the air ! Don 't move ! Slow down . We 're not the enemy here . - Let 's just keep our cool ... - You shut your robot mouth . Or I 'll have these men weld it shut for you . I chose you ! Now you choose me ! That 's not how it works . You can 't control everyone anymore ! Watch . We will build a life together , whether you want to or not ! We 're stuck in here ? What did you do ? ! No ! Fitz , I got you ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Grab him ! You 're lucky she didn 't kill you . At least the machinery in there - will keep her power contained . - No . That 's not her only power . We 're not robots , Glenn . Yes , they are ! They 're all robots . You assume each and every one of them is a damn C-3PO unless you hear otherwise from me ! And this one ! If she so much as blinks , take her down . - Am I clear ? - Yes , sir . - Is that really necessary ? - Necessary ? ! It 's essential . Unless you can explain to me in 50 words or less why I found Jeffrey Mace 's body washed up on the beach with his bones quaked apart , days after I found this base in flames , flesh melting off of robot bodies , 12 S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in critical with burns or broken bones . Three dead ... Double hits to the heart and crushed frickin ' skulls ! Can you explain that ? I can try . Wait . Ever ... Everybody should get out . - Leave me here alone . - Not a chance . She can 't be stopped . Freeze ! Right there ! All right , guys . It 's never too late to start a conversation . No , no ! Don 't shoot ! That was not us ! That thing is not a friendly ! - We 've got to get you out of here . - No . No . Wait . Wait ! And then the base under the oil rig fell into the sea . You expect me to believe a word of that ? She 's everywhere ! Aah ! What 's that mean , Coulson ? " She 's everywhere . " Who 's everywhere ? Where 's that Speedy Gonzalez girl ? Who 's attacking us ? ! Aida got out . - We should be good here . - No ! She 'll find us . No ! Get out of here ! No ! No ! No ! Wait ! Leave me ! You can 't stop her ! May ! Take off now ! We have to move ! If she can find us , she 'll kill us all ! Davis had her down for the count . They won 't listen to me ! She can 't be stopped ! May ! May ! You 're the only other person that knows about the Inhumans we tested . Hey ! Try it . Let 's see what happens . Davis ... We already left him . I 'm sorry , but he 's already dead . If you drop your guns , you can come with us . I don 't suggest staying , but the Zephyr 's leaving with or without you . Fall back ! Search the base for any other threats and any bodies ! May needs to keep us on the move . Or Aida will be on us like a flash . Even Yo-Yo couldn 't ... Wait a minute . Where was Yo-Yo during that standoff ? No . No . Yo-Yo has no idea what she 's in for . For that matter , neither do we . It 's called heartbreak , kroshka . Not even your new powers can repair it . Only time can heal that wound . Go on . To be human is to suffer . You are far from human . I 've read that book . We both know there are things beyond this universe . And you may , in fact , be one of them . I am nothing but torn and twisted insides ! I can 't stand it . I don 't want it . I can make you feel something else . That book helps build worlds . My plan will rebuild the world that you have grown accustomed to ... one where Inhumans are hunted . And we control the rest . It doesn 't hurt that both of us are unstoppable . But your plan is flawed . It 's too clean . I want them to suffer . Now ... make me feel something else . All better now ? We lost three men , sir . - To what ? - I 'm not sure . There 's nothing else here . The place is empty . All right . Clear out . We 'll have Hazmat come in at dawn . We 'll return in a moment . No !

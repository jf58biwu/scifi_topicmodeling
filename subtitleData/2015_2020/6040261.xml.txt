 Carter : I 'm peggy carter . [ elevator bell dings ] I work for the SSR , America 's premiere covert intelligence agency . [ alarm buzzing ] My mission parameters these days are ... Agent carter , cover the phones . That all changed when an old friend Asked me to become a double agent . Howard : I have a vault . Somebody cleaned me out . A couple of weeks later , my inventions ... They start turning up on the black market . He left me with an ally . Edwin jarvis . He 'll help you in any way he can . As of this moment , howard stark is a fugitive from justice . You 're the only one that can clear my name . [ both grunting ] Who did this to you ? You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . It 's a covert russian organization . Rumors had it , after the war , Their group wanted to purchase weapons to fight the allies . Dugan : Doc , need a ride home ? The ssr could use your help fighting leviathan . I 'll do anything I can . Forgot my compass . Would you grab that for me , pal ? Oh , bloody nora ! Whoa , nelly ! Uh ... [ clears throat ] is there anything else , daniel ? Uh ... Fyodor : My most heartfelt congratulations . You have all been selected to join leviathan . This is indeed a great honor for you . Soon , you will know the glory Of devoting your life to a greater good . Before we continue , if there are any among you Who wish to decline this opportunity , The time to speak is now . I have a wife . I have four daughters . They need me . You wish to decline , then ? If I may , sir . You would like to be with your family . Very good . Relieve him of his bonds . [ chokes ] His family ... All of them ... Will be joining him shortly . Are there any others Who wish to reunite with their loved ones ? You , perhaps . That was when I learned ... Monsters are real , And there is none more terrifying than leviathan . Here I thought it was just something They told the apple knockers to scare them . How long has leviathan been active ? Since after the great war . Stalin 's goal is for russia To become a leading power in the world , Which means having better weapons Than our enemies and our allies . Leviathan has been very successful ... Mechanical , biological ... Human ? Is that what that young girl was , a human weapon ? My knowledge of specific operations Is sadly restricted to only what I was told . That building seemed to house a training facility ... Shackles on the beds , classrooms ... Training young girls to be what , assassins ? Seems like the russians would want to train grown men . Women are often overlooked , taken for granted . They can slip easily through a man 's defenses . How many girls were there ? Again , I was not allowed ... Do you think the girls I wish I could be of more assistance , agent carter ... Who could be of more assistance , dr . Ivchenko ? Agent carter ... A word . Chief dooley , I really must insist You allow me to continue to ... Carter , could you just zip it for a minute ? Geez . Look , your work in russia was admirable , And I need to hear everything he has to say about leviathan . And as callous as it sounds , Well , you should , because that little girl , I believe , grew up to kill agent krzeminski . Where did you come up with that theory ? Ballistics identified the firearm that killed krzeminski To be a korovin tk , a russian gun . So ? Small enough to be more suitable for a woman 's grip . It 's also the most plausible explanation Of how howard stark got involved with this in the first place . [ scoffs ] He is a notorious womanizer . The story of the vault break-in can only ring true If he were manipulated by a well-trained female operative . This is so much bigger than your buddy howard stark . I can ... Yes , it is . Do you really think that he 's involved with leviathan ? All right . Chase it . S-sir ? You got a hunch . See if you 're right . Would you look at that . You really can keep your mouth shut when you try . Now get the hell out of here . Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . " when I look back on it , it seems to me " as if I have been living here like a poor woman ... " just from hand to mouth . " I have existed merely to perform tricks for you , torvald . " But you would have it so . " you and papa have committed a great sin against me . It is your fault that I have made nothing of my life . " Bravo , angie . Oh . [ chuckles ] Thanks , Esther . [ indistinct conversations ] I had to practically sign over my firstborn to miriam Thank you . I can 't imagine where I dropped mine . Angie , that was wonderful . Ugh . Tell that to the producers . They said it was the worst audition they 'd ever seen . You ordering ? No , I 'm waiting for a friend . Angie , you can 't just let one audition get you down . How about seven ? Oh , I 'm sorry , but things will look up . I 've been telling myself that for a year . Time to take the hint ... The floodlights are calling , but not for me . My father signed me up for secretary school . I start next week . Oh , angie , no . You belong onstage . If that were true , I 'd be there already . We 'll talk about this when I get home tonight . Nothing to say . I 'll let you and your friend talk . [ soft music plays ] [ bell rings ] I must say , I was very pleased to receive your call . Can I assume you 're back on the team ? I don 't believe we ever were on the same team , so no . We are still , however , working towards a common goal . Fair enough . It may interest you to know That your superior paid me a visit . Chief dooley ? Yes . In the prevailing winds within the ssr . Leviathan has certainly sparked their interest , But howard isn 't out of the woods just yet . Information on a battle in the german town of finow . I didn 't say anything at the time , But mr . Stark did visit finow in 1944 . He returned ... Distressed And soon after began construction on his vault . What did howard have to say about it ? I 've tried getting messages to him . However , he 's been difficult to reach . Mm . Interesting , but that can wait . Russia has been training young women To be undercover operatives , And we both know that howard 's major weakness is ... Women . And raspberry truffles . I need you to get me a list of all the women That howard has ... Entertained in the last year . I 'm not sure there 's enough ink in the whole of new york To complete that request . Fine . Just in the last six months , then . Is that possible ? Oh , yes . Yes , I suggest we start with the western hemisphere . Oh , please . [ indistinct conversations ] You here for the interview ? That 's me . Come on in . I was about to give up on seeing any more girls . Are you closed ? Oh , I gave the rest of the staff a long weekend . I like to spend extra time with the applicants , Give them my full attention . [ chuckles ] Bring yourself this way and , uh , we 'll get started . [ buzzer ] [ indistinct conversations ] [ buzzer ] Hey , sheldon . You look great . How they treating you in here ? Warm cot ? Three squares ? Been stabbed yet ? What the hell do you want ? Just a little trip down memory lane . You said some lady beat you up , cuffed you to a chair . Yeah , yeah . Hey , why don 't we , uh ... Why don 't we keep that under our hats , okay ? Think you could identify her ? Maybe . Maybe not . Six months . Probably get it knocked down to three if you behave yourself . That 's it ? Let me remind you you were arrested For transporting an explosive That could level all of new york . This is a one-time offer . We got a deal ? Yeah , we got a deal . Oh , yeah . That 's her . You sure ? Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm sure . Take another look . Look . She came to the house that night . She was looking for brannis . She left with him and the truck full of nitramene . She 's a cute broad ... When she 's not punching me in the face . Who is she ? Not who I thought she was . Albert : We call it the stark special , Custom-designed to his exact specifications . Are you saying howard stark buys a bracelet For every women he 's ... Oh , no . Yes . He considers it a parting gift To commemorate their time together . Mr. Stark demands only the highest quality diamonds , The highest karat of gold . Any girl would be lucky to wear such a fine piece . Would you like to try it on ? I-if we could just see the list , we 'll be on our way . Anything for friends of mr . Stark . [ clears throat ] Oh , it 's shorter than I thought it would be . How could he possibly meet this many women ? Well , the academy awards is a very busy time . What are you doing ? Are well-known actresses , models , and socialites , Publicly established for several years . They can be disregarded . Well , I wouldn 't dismiss her . You think ginger rogers is a russian assassin ? When I escorted her from mr . Stark 's villa . The darkest gates to the abyss . I get girl after girl in here , and for what ? They 're just waiting for their future husbands To come walking through that door complaining about a cavity . [ chuckles ] [ chuckles ] I 'm looking for someone with ambition , Someone who 's , um , willing to go the extra mile . So tell me , dottie , are you that someone ? Aah ! Aah ! Ow ! Aah ! Help ! I 'm being ... Never used one of these before . [ whirring ] Open wide . [ screaming ] [ jackhammering ] Into the breach ! Aren 't you coming ? I thought I might sit this one out , actually . I need you to positively identify these women . Stop dawdling and come along . I-it 's just that with mr . Stark 's tendency to , um ... Prematurely evacuate ? When ... When he ends a relationship , He prefers to do so by proxy , and that proxy is me . Ugh . Sufficed to say , These encounters could be disagreeable . We 're not having dinner with these women . I just need to see their wrists . Not quite ... the girl in russia had scars on her wrists From being cuffed to the bed . If my theory is correct , Our spy will have those same scars . To see these women 's wrists without involving me . Maybe , but it would be more complicated and less fun . Come along , mr . Jarvis . [ Buddy Banks' " Name it Claim it " plays ] Oh . No , I haven 't seen howard stark , and I don 't want to . He 's a no-good , dirty , lowdown Snake , as if he could buy me off with a trinket . I 'm not that kind of girl . If I did that , if any girl did that , You know what people would call her ? A floozy , that 's what . He should be shamed . Tell him if I ever see him just scatting about town , I 'm gonna ... ... Show him the business end of this ! [ gasps ] ♪ You can name it ♪ Baby , you can claim it no . ♪ You can name it ohh ! ♪ Baby , you can claim it [ grunts ] ♪ You can name it [ grunts ] [ gasps ] ♪ Baby , you can claim it [ whimpers ] ♪ Claim it Well , mr . Stark would seem to have An unfortunate attraction to violent women . I imagine they were far less violent before they met him . Ida emke is next . Yes , a dancer he met at a charity auction , I believe . Hmm . [ scoffs ] His variety is staggering . According to this , she 's close-by . Perfect . Perfect . [ clears throat ] So there 's nothing you can tell me about these ? Please forgive me . I was not engineer . I was merely psychiatrist . Do you know where leviathan got them ? From where governments usually get secrets , I imagine ... They stole them . Let 's take a break . How about a drink ? Thank you . How about two ? Ay-yi . [ sighs ] [ coughs ] Ah , Nostrovia . Ahh . [ sighs ] You 're having some troubles at home ? What are you talking about ? Mm , the blanket and the pillow and the toothbrush , razor ... Nature of the job . You got to be prepared for some late nights . But ... You have framed photo ... Mm-hmm . ... Facedown on the credenza , While the photo of your charming children Is displayed with pride . I can only assume that slighted photo is of your wife . I would say that you do not spend much time in your own bed . I apologize . [ stammers ] I have gone too far . I am a fool . Don 't worry about it . There 's just so much water under the bridge Between me and loretta , I wouldn 't even know where to begin . Is that empire state building ? No , that 's over on 5th . Huh . There are so many tall buildings here , yes ? Go ahead . Open the window . Wow . The buildings stretch out forever . Careful . Don 't fall out . You know , this city is unlike anything I have ever seen before . And you are telling me there is one building Taller than all of these ? Tell you what . Soon as this is all over , I 'll see about getting you a personal tour . Hell , I 'll even take you myself . 103 stories . You guys get " king kong " over in russia ? Of course . [ chuckles ] [ grunts , chuckles ] Fay wray ... Oh , I had a thing for her . No one home . What a shame . Shall we ? Uh , keep an eye on the hallway . Knock if there 's danger . Hello . I 'm the ... Exterminator . Somebody saw a roach . I have to catch these things before they get out of hand . Shouldn 't your ... shouldn 't your mother be somewhere nearby ? [ chuckling ] I think I hear her calling you . Please go away . Who were you talking to ? A future mafioso . Did you find anything useful ? Ida 's long gone . The room 's completely empty , but she 's definitely our girl . Oh . How can you tell ? Uh , scratches on the bedposts . Remember , the russian girls Were handcuffed to the beds from a very young age . Are you suggesting she 's still doing it ? That must be a very hard habit to break . That is immensely disturbing . I 'll knock on a few doors , In the meantime , see if you can track down the owners of the building . They may have a paper trail on her . Meet me back at the automat , and let 's move fast . We 're close . I can feel it . He was 4-f . I 'm off risking my neck , serving my country , She cheats on me with some jerk from hoboken . You feel that it was more than a betrayal . Overseas , you rose to high-ranking officer And proved yourself again and again . Here , she is just showing you your inadequacies . I am not inadequate . A plumber with flat feet ... That 's inadequate . That background check you asked for . Thanks , " yowch . " It 's actually " yawk . " You waiting for a tip or something ? The chief 's been in there a real long time With that russian guy . Well , that russian guy happens to be A huge lead in our case against stark , agent . Chief is just taking extra time To make sure he gets everything right . You have a problem with that ? It 's different from how he usually handles things . And I 'm just saying don 't worry about what dooley 's doing . Now , why don 't you go brew a pot of coffee ? Saw it was getting low . Okay . I lost my wife and children to leviathan . I 'm sorry . I do not say this for your pity But only to show you that you have lost nothing . It is too late for me to save my family . It is not too late for you to save yours . Yeah , and how am I supposed to work that miracle ? You cannot in your current frame of mind . You must focus on the good times ... When you and your wife were in love and happy . That 's supposed to help ? Yes . Just focus ... On her smile ... On her laugh ... Everything that you love about her . Focus . [ knock on door ] Chief , I got something for you .

[ crying ] Oh , gee . Um ... Please , don 't ... Do that . It 's just that her grandmother is doing poorly .

Oh , actors wear their emotions close to the surface . I could no more stop her than I could laurence olivier . [ sniffling ] What 's your grandmother 's name ? Gam-gam . Just ...

Dooley found out carter was a spy for stark , And he put everything on lockdown . The only person allowed anywhere near the lab is the chief . Hmm . Can you show me the exits on the map , please ? I may need to leave quickly . Here ... And here are your best bets . Thank you . Now I need your complete focus . Do I have that ? Yes , sir . Good . What I need you to do is leave this room , Retrieve your belongings , Like you would for the end of your shift . I need you to go to your favorite bar . Order a bourbon ... Only the best . Top-shelf . Savor that bourbon . Enjoy it . And when you have finished , I need you to step outside and do one more thing . [ tires screech ] Just got off the phone with my brother . He 's gonna drop a car off at the dublin house for you . Should at least get you out of town for a while . Thank you , angie . I also told my father to stuff secretary school . I belong on broadway .

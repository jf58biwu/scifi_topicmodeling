Add $ 10 for credit card . Why did you come by yourself ? I 'm looking for person . Really ? People are hard to come by on this isle . Doesn 't a young woman live here ? She 's about 29 years old . There 're only 2 women younger than I. Youth Group chair 's wife is 54 , The other lives over there , she 's 62 . What about the girl who worked at township office ? There 's no township office here ! Ma 'am , have you seen this girl ? MISSING PERSON She 's my daughter . It 's an official request from NASA , it 's about assisting in recovering a downed satellite . National Intelligence Service Send agent SHIN . And get a specialist from KARI on it too . Yes , sir . We don 't have the time for this . Korea Aerospace Research Institute ( KARI ) Long distance relationships don 't work . It 's cute at first but gets old fast . I follow 4 female followers of my boyfriend 's Instagram . Look at her , her ID is ' Lovely ' . 'Lovely Minji ' . 'Lovely ' is used to describe someone else . How can she call herself that ? And she puts ' baby ' on every comment . 'Baby , it 's so amazing ! ' - What does she do ? - Not sure . But I know what she eats . So I made a brilliant new app . Check it out . It can track your bae 's location , and mirror his calls and messages too ! I call it ' Bae , Where You At ? ' Don 't wanna know where your bae 's at . Your life is truly dull . But the app has a critical flaw . Your partner also has to install the app . But would you like to install it and test it ? Wouldn 't you love that ? People gave up privacy a long time ago . CCTVs at every corner , they readily put dashcams in their cars . There 's no such a thing as privacy . Why don 't you go to his place and stalk him ? I gotta pack up and head for Seoul . What 's up ? NASA is coming in for a forum , and they need someone from KARI too . My thesis review is in 2 days , must I babysit ? Of course you shouldn 't . Thesis review is no walk in the park ! I 'll go instead . Sung-jin , focus on the thesis . Sung-jin ? PRESUMPTION OF DEATH FORM What ? Did you get the form ? No . Not gonna sign ? Honey , it 's been 10 years , it 's time to ... Why ? For the compensation ? Why 're you becoming even more vulgar ? The living must go on living ? - Is that it ? - You call this living ? Do you know what day it is today ? If Yoo-ju saw you like this ... Sweetheart ... happy birthday . The path is rough , so just follow my steps . Yoo-ju . Don 't go ahead of me . Mine Field Oh man ... I can 't take this ... What a relief ... Shit ! Nasty ! What is it ? What the heck ? Phone number ? That 's mine . 'I need to find her ' . Who 's ' her ' ? Presumed to be a meteor shower ... near the Yellow Sea ... Are you Dr. KANG Ji-yun from KARI ? Yes I am , and you are ? I see . I made contact with her . You must 've excelled in school . I thought a scientist would be much older . I bet you flunked school . Can 't even introduce yourself . I 'm in charge of the search party on Korean side . And you 're the technical advisor . Search party ? I thought it was a forum ... What 's this about advising and searching ? Hear about the meteor shower last night ? Yes . But we were contacted before then . It wasn 't meteor . Can 't you just spill it ? No need to unnecessarily pique your curiosity . Are you from the intelligence ? Roger . Here they come . You can 't pick stuff up from the sea . It could be sent by the commies . Ma 'am , doesn 't it look like a person ? Look , it 's got arms too . It looks more like a big pot . - You leaving today ? - Yes . Let me make you breakfast . No , it 's okay . Then go hungry . Buddy , you 're too old to get into drunken fights ! This is your last strike , there 's no more ! Hello ? Bud , I 'm getting a call . It could be that bastard . Yes , hello ? Hello ? Hello ! Hello ? Who 's pranking me this early ? ! I 'll kill you ! How does it figure out the phone number ? With the voice ? Do you understand me ? You can hear me ? ! What happened ? Hey ! Hey ! Come back ! Hey ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Hello ? ! I thought it was a forum in Seoul , but I 'm in Incheon . A quay by the sea . No idea . They 're looking for something on the isle . Yeah . So , how 's Thursday night ? Company dinner ? Sweetie , can 't you do that another time ? You always have it when I 'm in town ! Forget it ... Hold on a minute . Thank you . Thanks again . MISSING PERSON What about Friday night ? Distant uncle 's birthday ? You celebrate that too ? Why 're you so fixated on your family events ? Hae-gwan , here ! More , more , more ! What happened ? You dipped it in the ocean , ran it through the mud , and now you expect me to fix it ? So salty . Just get a new one . You know I can 't get a new number . This belongs in the museum . Fine , let 's go inside . - There 's one more . - What is it ? It looks like part of a satellite , but there 's nothing to it . Satellite or rice cooker , anything electric is similar . So can you fix it or not ? You play with a man 's pride well . This place may look shabby now , but us vendors were gods of electronics back then . What 'll you do with the satellite anyway ? I got something to ask it . Hold onto your pants . I made some amazing upgrades . Take a look ! Why is it so sloppy ? Dumb shit ... This tech is made in Korea , called VoiceWare , it can vocalize any text . Heard of Stephen Hawking ? That smartest wheelchair man on earth . He uses this to communicate with people . Here . Okay , ready , action ! Action . Weird ... Maybe the voltage is too low . Good , very good . It supports 5 languages . - Pull the plug ? - No . That 's enough . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hold it , hold it ! Remember me ? 3-7-8-9 . Right , 3789 . You put your number in there ? It knows your number only from your voice . How 's that possible ? What about the reverse ?

That can 't be ... Out of the way . You said the fire broke out at 10 . But I dropped her off at the station at 8 ! I don 't know what she did in those 2 hours . But you need to put her on the missing persons list . Don 't be coarse because she 's not your kid ! Why would she stay there for 2 hours ? ! Stop this ! We have to find her ! Find her where ? Definitely not here ! What number did she call last ? It ends with 3789 . The call never went through . Sounds familiar ? No ... She was never there . She wasn 't .

You don 't even know what that thing is ! But one thing 's for sure , it 's my last hope of finding her . Okay , fine , Hae-gwan . At least take that . You can 't carry it around .

It 's government business , sorry for the inconvenience . Forgive us . You didn 't do anything wrong . You didn 't think he was a bad guy . So , did you see the object ?

Can 't be . I honestly don 't know ! Who the hell are you ! This came with a guitar that I stole . It wasn 't bad , so I listened to it . Dammit ! Got a CD player in there ?

MISSING PERSON Missing at 19 years old currently 29 Hello ? I 'm calling about the missing person ad . Yes , please go ahead . Did you ... by any chance ... find a satellite on an isle ? Who are you ? Do you have it with you ? May I ask who you are ? I 'm ... Dr. KANG Ji-yun from KARI . You found it at Gureopdo , right ? How did you know where I was and what I did ? Everyone here knows you took it . You have to return it before you get in trouble . NASA and NIS agents are looking all over for it ! Hello ? Hello ? You 've seen the ad , right ? I know this may sound crazy , but that satellite may be able to find my daughter . Find your daughter ? With the satellite ? I don 't care about morality of surveillance , I just really need it . - Surveillance ? - I 'm hanging up now . If I find my daughter , I 'll call you back . Hello ? Hello ? It was brought in for repair , so thanks for returning . Do you know what this is ? I was told this was stolen along with it . It 's a demo CD . Singer hopefuls give these out . Every kind of musicians go through here . My kid sang ? Are you sure ? Not too many parents get it . - But why now ? - The thing is ... she went missing around that time . Good lord ... I 'm so sorry to hear that . Wait a minute , that 's weird ... Stay put , let me check something . My hunch was right . A guy left this for repair , but after he made it big , he changed his number and never came back . Do you have the number ? The old one ? What for ? He won 't answer . It doesn 't matter . Surveillance satellite ? Bae , Where You At ? Agent SHIN made a call View History Welcome ! Are you looking for anything ? Something discrete . Anything like that ? This , this please ... - You 're a girl ? ! - What ? Sorry . I don 't believe this ... This one , how much is it ? It 's a new style ... What do you even know about clothes ? Clothes : a form of artificial skin used to protect body , normally made with textile or animal leather . Enough ! Is this clothes for my protection ? Yes , it 's for protection . Just say thank you in this case ! Protection is good ? He 's so cool ! Are you ... 'Seedless Strawberry ' ? Are you here for an audition ? A ' Lonesome Guitarman ' ? No , it 's not that ... I get it , you got a pen ? Are you Yoo-ju 's dad ? Do you remember me ? Her single bedroom ! I 'm too busy to be running your errands ! I could 've just shipped it . Okay . Are you a student ? A student ? I 'm an underground singer / songwriter . How do you know Yoo-ju ? She received a lot of musical inspiration from me . To speak frankly , we 're transitory ? We 're not really together ... 'Transitory ' ? You stupid hooligan ! Feel my transitory fist ! What have you done to my little girl ? ! What a poser ! You wore a wig ? ! You 're blowing this out of proportion ! I took over her lease ! - Her lease ? - Yes ! I paid her housing deposit and even that guitar too ! The deposit ? I only heard that she disappeared suddenly . I thought you forced her back home . Did you listen to it ? Huh ? What ? Her songs . It 's really good . I 'm sure you didn 't know , but she had talent . Shit , she should 've continued her music . 'I 'm sure you didn 't know ' ? She 's my daughter . You barely knew her . I raised her for 20 years . Sorry that I bothered you . Wait ! Please take this guitar . This was hers . I sent her to Seoul to study , but she hung out with punks ! Music is useless ! ILLEGAL PARKING Sons of bitches ! They put parking sticker on my shitty car ! Yoo-ju 's dad came to see you ? Yeah , he actually came to my show . It 's not like I was her boyfriend . - He said you were one ? - No , nothing like that . - She had a boyfriend . - I know ! Caller location , Chungcheong Province , Guisan District ... Satellite = A.I. ? That satellite ... may be able to find my daughter . Dr. KANG ! Agent SHIN 's asking for you . Come in . You can 't fetch a girl in the middle of the night . Sit down . Dr. KANG , you hid something from me . Another KARI scientist was supposed to come , but you volunteered . I had some business in Seoul . Give me that too . That man in Seoul , PARK ... something . PARK Dong-yun , your lover ? Long distance relationship for about 7 months ? Aren 't you worried ? Being apart for so long after living together ? Men can 't be trusted . Should I look into it for you ? This is violation of privacy . Even an NIS agent can 't do this ! Take a look . Name : KIM Hae-gwan . Residence : Daegu . Occupation : Unknown . He 's the prime suspect of our case . Look , who is that ? That 's ... that was a coincidence . We pulled his cell phone call log , - and found ... - Yes , I called him . I was going to say ... But didn 't have the chance ? I 've heard that before . He said he was looking for a missing person ! His daughter ? Give it to me . Daughter : KIM Yoo-ju . Presumed dead in the 2003 Daegu subway fire ... She 's dead ? No body was recovered due to prolonged fire , declared deceased after 5 years on missing list . How 's this related to the sat ? He said he lost his daughter . And he needs the satellite 's help . Why does he need a sat to find her ? It 's nonsense . It 's a surveillance satellite ! - What ? - I mean ... I don 't know the details , but he 's using that function to locate his daughter . You 're dismissed from this op . And keep your mouth shut . I 'll be watching . Got it ? This way . - Say bye . - Good bye ! Thank you for everything . KIM Yoo-ju ! I sent you to Seoul to study ! What have you been doing ? ! What do you mean ? You took out the deposit ! Where 're you staying ? ! I 'm staying at a friend 's , you don 't need to worry . Which one ? Her ? Did you trick my daughter ? - What 's wrong with you ? - Who are you ? ! - Dad ! - Where do you live ? ! - You can 't do this here ! - Do your parents know ? ! We were supposed to meet her boyfriend . She gave up her room to record her demo album . Did you know what she wanted to be ? Was she so desperate to be an idol ? She wanted to sing . It 's the same . Yes , dad . I 'll leave soon . A friend 's father came by . Okay , bye . I 'm sure she didn 't mean to hide it forever . She 'd have told you in time . Time ? When you two reconciled . I really don 't get it . Yoo-ju ... Keywords related to KIM Yoo-ju : KIM Hae-gwan 's biological offspring . Offspring ... She 's my child . Mountain . I used to take her hiking . Mint choco . Her favorite ice cream . Secret base . How do you know that ? Oh yeah , it 's your job to listen in on others . I do not obey a human 's order anymore . Did you get fired ? Humans hurt one another with surveyed information . Life 's like that . I wanted to protect her from that . Is protection good ? You idiot , where did you learn to talk back ? Buddy , what do they call you ? ID code : 1989-037B-S19 . So complicated ! Your name ... Wait a minute . Since you hear all voice , so how about ... 'Sori ' ? As in ' sound ' ? It 's perfect .

His name is KIM Hae-gwan . He 's your target now . No one leaves until he 's captured on CCTV . Understand ? Begin . What do they ... Continue your search ! Drop this nonsense , just do it . And go back to school from home . Dad , why must you decide everything ? I 'm advising you from experience ! You can 't act so recklessly ! Hear me out . When you were my age , you never said to yourself , 'I must do this , or I may regret for the rest of my life ' . You can 't do anything without consulting me . I 'm doing that now . But after you got caught , what 's the point ? There 's something I want to do ! Just hear me out ! - You 're only 20 . - I 'm already 20 ! You don 't know what you want yet ! Yoo-ju , we can 't have a talk if you 're being so emotional . Wipe your tears , and listen to me . - As you live ... - You have no idea . You 're not even curious what I want to do . Fine . If you think you can do better , get out . I fed you , raised you and got you through school , but you 're not even grateful ! Go and live however you want ! I don 't need a daughter like you ! Get out ! Goddammit ! Yoo-ju is ... down there ? Caller authenticated . 50m straight ahead . 40m . 30m . 25m . 20m . 15m . 10m . 5m . 3m , 2m , 1m . Caller arrived . Excuse me ? Yes ? Do you ... know KIM Yoo-ju ? Do your parents know ? ! Just get over here ! Forget school and everything else ! Yoo-ju 's boyfriend ? You come here at this time of the year ? Do you live here ? No , I work near Seoul . Do you also think ... she 's dead ? If you had a daughter , could you easily accept that she 's dead ? Sir ... There 's something I listen to whenever I come here . It 's a voicemail she left . First voicemail . Still in class ? I 'm in Daegu , it just happened . I fought with dad and I 'm heading home on subway . It was inevitable . I was prepared for it , but I still feel terrible . He and I have a secret base . I 'll go there and wait for him . He 's still my dad , we 'll make peace . Huh ? I think there 's a fire , I 'll call you back . Yoo-ju ... Dad 's here . I 'm sorry , baby . I got here so late . I 'm so sorry ... Sweetheart ... I ... I searched all over the world ! Except here , Yoo-ju ! Yoo-ju , let 's go . Yoo-ju , my baby . Let 's go home , it 's time to go home . Yoo-ju , I missed you so much , so I came here for you . Sweetie , it 's too dark in here . It 's too dark ! Yoo-ju ! There 's a man on the track ! Yes , director . You 're making a mess of this support detail . - The prosecutors are watching . - That 's not the issue , sir . This is no ordinary satellite , it 's linked to NSA . Director ? Sir ? Call me on a secured line . Tell me in detail . So this sat is used for NSA surveillance . They hid this fact and came here to retrieve it . - It 's known as ... - Echelon . Yes ! And it 's in Korea ? Yes . - I figured this out . - Good job . If we secure the satellite first , we can request its data . But continue to support their search . Yes , sir . - But when I ... - Subway in Daegu ... Holy crap ! What is it ? ! KIM popped up at a subway station in Daegu . I 'll call you back , sir . - Daegu ? Why ? - Attempted suicide . He 's going all out . Was police notified ? The station staff already called it in ... Goddammit ! Hello ? It 's KIM Hae-gwan . Sir , where are you ? Actually , don 't answer that . I put you in a tough spot . I 'm sorry . Don 't worry . Sir , but you can 't call me like this . It doesn 't matter now . What ? The satellite is at Jungang-no park . They 're all listening right now . Hello ? You waited for me ? Secret base . Sorry I 'm late . Where 's the satellite now ? KARI technicians are extracting it now . But will they be able to extract that Intel ? If the NSA finds out that we have the satellite , they 'll feel the pressure . Think about it . That satellite contains all call records made in Korea . From politicians , CEOs and prosecutors . We 'll have the dirt on everyone . - Agent SHIN . - Yes , sir . When the US hands over that Intel , make a copy . A copy ? We can 't just hand it over to the top . Can you hear me ? If my presumption is correct , you 're listening right now . Thinking like a human . KANG Ji-yun , born 1983 , researcher at KARI . I 've been listening to you for a long time . What 'd you like to know ? Would you like to check PARK Dong-yun 's call history ? Please confirm . No . I don 't want to find out like this . - Thank you . - What ? Thank you for not asking . I have a message for KIM Hae-gwan . How the heck did you end up in NIS 's custody ? I found a satellite on an isle . I was searching for Yoo-ju with it , but NASA and NIS came after me , so here I am . Go on . Did you know Yoo-ju wanted to sing ? Yeah . So she told you . It 's different with a mother . Girls are awkward around dads at that age . She even had a boyfriend . Yeah ? She didn 't tell me that . She was definitely our daughter . Would she have gotten married young too ? Remember ? My dad grabbed you by the neck . - Would we have ? - What ? Allowed her to pursue what she wanted . Don 't blame yourself . I could have ... let her do it . No . A mother gives her child a life , but a dad releases her with an unjust view of the world . 'I won 't live like dad , or mom , ' that 's not a bad saying . Protecting our child at all costs , it probably wasn 't the best for Yoo-ju . - Honey . - Yes ? There 's one last thing I have to do . Yes , hello ? Dr. KANG , it 's Hae-gwan . - Mr. KIM ? - Are you ... with Sori right now ? Sori ? Who 's that ? It 's what I call it . The satellite . It 's too late . NIS agents took it away a moment ago . Dr. KANG , there 's something Sori has to do . Somewhere it has to be . Can 't you help me on this ? I have to meet Sori . There isn 't anything ... Bae , Where You At ? Agent SHIN made a call Yes , director . We 're en route to the exchange location . Yes , I 'll make a copy as soon as we get the data . My agents ? You don 't have to worry , sir . They have no idea what 's going on ... What was that ? A minor traffic incident , sir . We 're on it . Hey ! Move out of the way . Say what ? Where are your manners ? ! Why should I move ? ! You move ! I 'm sorry , please back the car . This guy is a piece of work . I was ahead of you ! I had the right of way ! Don 't you know ? ! - Whoever enters the ... - You two , standby . Dealing with potential threat . - We 'll move in 1 minute . - Take care of it ! Sori ! What the hell ? ! Get out ! We 'll move the car for you . Grab him ! Sit right here . What are you ? The police ? ! That son of a bitch ... Sori ! Sori ! Scream ! Hurry , hurry ! Get going ! - What ? ! - Let 's go ! - Go ? ! - Just go ! Now ! Now ! Now ! Stop the car , asshole ! - Are they after us ? - What ? ! - Anyone following ? - No ! There 's no one ! Nothing ! No one 's following us ! Not a single car ! We did it ! We did it ! Sori ... Sori ? Are you okay ? It 's probably the power . It used up all its power for that high pitch . It 's all right . I 'll take a look when we arrive . By the way , where are we going ? I have a place in mind . These solar panels will recharge the battery . But why Afghanistan ? You 're gonna send it by itself ? Not knowing where you 're going is the real journey . It 's all ready . 3789 . Yes , that 's me . 4982 . What is this place ? It 's where your real journey begins . - Real journey ? - You must find her . Can you really do this alone ?

 - I 'm glad we could help . - It 's very impressive . Ever since the announcement , we 've had a large number of Hairies come forward for the initiative . Well , you 're making us both look good . What are you doing ? Grab your stuff . I need to know who or what that is . It 's a power not to be messed with , boy . Anyone who 's caught in its blast can no longer move on from this life . I 'm pregnant . My child 's a Hairy . Please ! Well , you 've been dealing with this your whole life . But it 's moulded you , shaped you for this role . You 're ready for this . Wait . I can 't keep up this pace . Wait . What are you doing ? I can walk . Alright . I 'll walk . I 've never seen one like this before . No . And I 'm sure it 's not a random attack . No police . Of course . Whatever happens , she mustn 't be taken to a hospital , subjected to a barrage of tests . I understand . Street surveillance cameras would have found them . Won 't take me long to track them down . And get that footage off the CA system . We don 't want them anywhere near this . Consider it done . I 'm pregnant . Please don 't hurt me . Please , I need ... I need food and water . I 'm worried about my baby . Do you speak English ? - We 'll get you some water . - Oh , thank God . Please , please let me go. - - I don 't understand . Why have you brought me here ? Perhaps I can help . I 'm a doctor . I looked after your people in the city . I wish your people no harm . Please. - - Please don 't go . Don 't leave me here with him . Oh , God . In other headline news today , the search continues for the subhumans that escaped the Containment Authority 's prison convoy . Numbers at the Inclusion Clinic , led by the Department of Human Safety 's newly appointed Waruu West , are lower than expected . In ... Have you got a minute ? How can I help ? Anything you 'd like to report ? The other creature . The thing with the blue light . You were going to investigate and get back to me . He ... didn 't kill any of those men , did he ? No . They appear to have been ... stunned only . Are you suggesting it 's not dangerous ? Not at all . I 'm just gathering as much information as I can . If you can 't tell me what it is , what it wants , how we can deter it ? Trust me , Minister , I will find a way to stop him . Let me know if there 's any developments . - Been worried about you . - Waruu tried to kill me . That prick 's trying to wipe us off the face of the earth . He 's pumping Hairies full of chemicals . Makes them lose their hair , their strength . All you 've gotta do is volunteer , play nice . Eventually , no CA . No containment . No DNA testing . - He can 't do that . - He 's doing it . Well , then , we need to stop him . Its scales would shimmer under the water like jewels . And that fish was so big , so big , that whenever it moved its fin , huge waves would crash against the shore . You telling her lies too ? I 'll finish it later . Don 't do this here . You killed my parents . Stoned off your head . Driving a car with your own son in the back . What kind of person ... mother does that ? Did you plan it ? Huh ? Deliberately set the whole thing up ? Answer me . Koen ... I 'm so sorry . That 's it ? " Sorry " ? What the hell was that ? I don 't even know you . Just ... listen to me . Koen , listen . She 's sick . Uncle Jimmy . Unc ! Uncle ! Uncle Jimmy ! How many more people knew about the accident ? Huh ? You knew . Waruu knew . So was it everybody except me ? You all lied to me . My whole life . I grew up in bullshit ! Tell me you 've found them . Cameras tracked them all the way through the city , but then we lost them after they left sector 534 . Lost them ? They 've travelled west out of the city some hours ago . No cameras . Moving surprisingly fast . Highway patrols ? They weren 't using roads . But she 's still alive . West could mean mountains . Well , can you show me ? How do I find her in there ? You 'd need an army . No-one 's seen Latani ? No . Maybe she found a way out . We need to believe that . After Djukara ... Our boy . I have to go . Boondee . I understand why you gave up hope . Came here . No . They forced me . I never would have chosen this . - Waruu . - Minister . A word ? Of course . The polling results are in . We 've dropped several points on average . Granted , there 's a drop in competence across the board , but responses to your specific appointment and performance , well ... it 's not good . You 're not invoking faith in the electorate . They see you as an ineffectual poster boy . Takes time . As a black man , I 'll always be seen as a poster boy . Opinion will change once we start getting results through . We don 't have time . You need to change people 's perception of you . Convince me to trust you . If you have seen these subhumans or Hairy sympathisers , contact your local CA branch immediately . If you have seen these subhumans or Hairy sympathisers , contact your local CA branch immediately . Hurry . You have entered a prohibited area . Run . Run ! Run . Go ! - No . - Come on , Alinta . Go ! - Drop the weapon . - I will shoot . I said drop the weapon . Mum ! Go ! Run ! Stop ! Step back . You 're under arrest . You bastard . Latani ! - Latani ! - Latani ! You 've been with Jimmy . Yeah . The old bastard showed you the accident , didn 't he ? You have every reason to hate me . Yeah , I do . He showed me something else too . What 's that ? Muya . Anyone who gets caught in the blue blast , their muya gets trapped . Anyone ? Yeah , anyone . Oh , if the cancer takes me right now ... there 's no reunion for me with the ancestors . Yep . CA scum . I 'll take that as a compliment , darling . Thank you , boys . We 'll take it from here . I 'm sorry . - We gotta let ' em go . - What 's your problem ? Let ' em go . Stand down , Dolan . They 're just kids . - Subbies aren 't kids . - She 'll be right . - They 're animals . - Hey ? - What the hell is wrong with you ? - Are you okay ? You sure ? The woman ... She 's the one I told you about . - You 're doing her mum ? - Mm-hm . You 're doing her mum ? Oh . Well , I never would have expected that . Turn around . Face the car . Turn around . These subbies are ripping out people 's hearts , and you 're supposed to be stopping them . Get in the car . What are you going to do with me ? You know they 'll be looking for me . Where are you going ? Wait ! Why are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ? Dolan . Dolan ! Come here . You can have your woman . Go on , take her . Get out of here . But just the mum . You can 't separate them . You are in no position to negotiate . - It 'll be alright . - What about the girls ? I 'll take them in for processing . Oh , man , you can 't do that ! Listen , sunshine . Take the deal or I 'll report you . Your call . Wise man . - Let her go ! - Come on , you 're coming with me . - Let her go ! - Come on . Mum ! - Stop it ! - You 're going with me . In the van . Get in the van . - Shush ! Quiet down , darling . - Watch your head . - Watch your head . - Mum ! Mum ! Where are they taking them ? Processing , alright ? We have got to go . You can 't separate us . Please ! You being locked up won 't help , alright ? Alinta , I 'll come for you . I am so sorry , Jarrod . This is ... This is terrible . It 's an outrage . Must be beside yourself . Have you heard anything from them ? Any set of demands ? Nothing . Well , the Containment Authority should handle this . We really don 't need news of it getting out . This footage has already been edited into a package for broadcast . Look , I understand this is your wife , but this is also a terrorism issue , national security . On that basis , it would be a criminal offence ... indeed , treason for you to ... disseminate the footage . Wouldn 't you say the public has a right to know the serious danger it faces ? I would say the public has a need to feel assured they are safe and protected from terrorism by the government . But they 're not . Do not broadcast that footage . The last sighting of that Hairy and my wife was in sector 532 , which would suggest they 're headed for the mountains . How do you know which sector ? I want full clearance for Steve Mclntyre . You 're blackmailing me . I 'd like to think of it more as a strategic alliance . The government and Slade Industries have worked together before . - We can do it again . - That 's just not possible . Well , perhaps this might persuade you that we all want the same thing , Minister . That 's from one of your CA surveillance cameras . - But this is classified information . - Vigilante . Some sort of superpower , roaming the streets . A new kind of Hairy . The government hushes it up . Give full access to Steve Mclntyre . And I want whoever gave that footage to Slade . I don 't care what rules you have to bend or break . Waruu West . He 's the first place you should look . - How you doing ? - Good . My partner , he took the two young females for processing ? The human and the Hairy ? Yeah . Female human , yes . But she was processed alone . There 's no Hairy prisoner recorded . Okay . Um ... no worries . He must still have her . Can I have a quick word with the young girl ? I 've gotta follow something up . Sorry , she 's being interviewed . I 'd say she won 't be going anywhere tonight . Give me a call when she 's done . Dolan , 249 . Uncle Jimmy ... Did he mention a way to get my muya back ? I think the muya can only be re-entered if someone 's dead . I have to wait ? You should kill me . I don 't know if I can bring you back . Why would you want to ? After what I did ... That 's not it . - Something 's broken . - What do you mean ? I can 't heal right anymore . This is Waruu , isn 't it ? I messed both you boys up . I thought cancer was my punishment , but I should have realised it was bigger than that . I 'm condemned to live alone for eternity . Aunty ... It 's alright , boy . I don 't expect anything from you . Things are as they should be . I guess we 've got nothing to lose if we give it a try , then . Your friend , Tim Dolan , gave you to me . That was nice of him , wasn 't it ? You 're the worst kind of subbie . You know that ? Not sticking with your own kind . Preying on weak , innocent humans . Selling them your sob story . I 'm not afraid of you . Good . Well , we 're going to have a little fun , then . Don 't touch me . Not if you were the last thing on earth , darling . You 're probably crawling with lice . So , how fast are you , subbie ? I want to see you run . I 'm sorry ... What 's that ? - - What 's that ? You 're casting a spell or something ? You 're going to need a lot more than that . Are you ready ? One ... Two ... Three .. Come on , come on . Shh , shh ... You alright ? That calls for a smoke . Jarli . I know your people . I 've worked for them . I 've helped them. - - You will stay here . What ? How long ? As long as it takes . No , I ... I need to be in a hospital . I need a doctor . Please . I can walk by myself . I can walk by myself . Thanks . Been searching for your girl ? Yeah . One day , you won 't come back . You know that . Until I know she 's ... I gotta keep trying . Sometimes , you 've got to learn to live without them . I already lost two to the CA . They 're not getting them all . I 'll die before I let that happen . You probably will , looking like that . She 'll never even know you tried . I 've got none left . And look at me . First day I walked without fear ... was the day I walked out of that clinic . I think I have something you might be interested in . Been looking for your man , the creature . And ? Nothing on his movements . Got another lead , about to follow up . Elaborate . I think I know someone who can help . And who is that ? That animal has Charlotte . What ? Took her , out the front of the house . Know where she is ? No . Same clan as our initiative man , Boondee . Bilamunju . You should have told me you had this . Of course , without the Cleverman , it 's just a stick . All this is useless . It has a pulse . One drop of Koen 's blood activated it . Now , nothing can damage it . Nothing . Except this . But I don 't know how yet . May I ? It 's organic . Once plant material and now , through petrification , stone . It 's amazing . It was liquid when I took it . Is that so ? Strange . Waruu West . Don 't do anything until I get there . Gotta go . We 're working together now , aren 't we ? I 'll bring it back . We 'll lose valuable time . Turn it back into its original form . It 'll be my pleasure . Where 's my daughter ? Alinta West was found in the company of a Hairy . That 's a serious offence . That offence needs to disappear . Your daughter 's details are not in the system . It 's as if she never existed . Can you explain that ? Then how do you know the girl you have is my daughter ? She told us ... after some argument . If you 've hurt her in any way ... She 's unharmed . Don 't worry . And all of her details now , including her crime , - are in the system . - I am the system . Release her to me under house arrest , put a security tag on her . I 'll deal with the charges later . Now , where is she ? I 'll take you . Thank God you 're alright . How stupid are you ? Nice to see you too , Dad . Does your mother know what you 've been up to ? - Where is she ? - I don 't know . Tell me . I have no idea . We all got split up when we were arrested . I need to find Latani . - You 're coming home with me . - No way . I 'm not losing you again . You didn 't lose me . They 're going to fit you with a security tag . I 'll take you home . You 're sick . You want this back ? It 's yours . You 're in a good mood . Are you coming ? - Keep this warm for us . - I reckon . Maybe you 're not such a prick . - That 's a crap apology . - Who 's apologising ? Whatever you said to Linda worked . Good one . Getting any better ? No . Any news on Nerida and the girls ? Mustn 't have been easy , what you did . Just a bit of deep breathing , that 's all . Nah , not that bit . You forgave the unforgiveable . Why 'd you do it ? I was crazy with grief . Jealousy . I loved your father . Too much . I just drove straight at them . And I could see your mother had gone into labour . I grabbed her arm and I pulled ... I pulled her from the wreckage . There was ... so much blood . And you were coming . I could see that . Weren 't nothing going to stop you popping out right there , in the glass and ... blood and metal . I didn 't have to do much . I always thought it was my fault that she died . This got nothing to do with you , boy . I brought all this on . I guess we 're even , then . Enough yapping . We gotta get you out of them clothes . You 're a leader , boy . You 're going to start looking like one . Like Uncle Jimmy ... mad hair and no shoes . Do you like it ? Don 't I get to choose any of my own stuff ? Step outside , the alarm gets activated at CA . Damage or break the security tag , same thing . I 'll make us some dinner . Come inside . It 's safe . You can have a shower , get some rest . We can talk later . I promise . You 're just another slaver . What makes it worse is that you 're a black slaver . I 'm more black than you 'll ever be . Your skin 's the only thing about you that says black man . I need this tested . I 'd appreciate if you kept this - between the two of us . - Of course . One of your people took something that belongs to Slade . We are going to get it back . Keep quiet . You shut this down , then what ? I go back to being hunted on the streets .

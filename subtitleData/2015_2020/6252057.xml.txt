That 's why we have his logo seared on our backs ! " Breeding stock ! " " Battle fodder ! " No , I am awaited ! You 're an old man 's battle fodder ! Killing everyone and everything ! We 're not to blame ! Then who killed the world ? ( GRUNTS ) I made a deal up ahead . Safe passage . I don 't know if it 's still any good . Get back in the hold ! Keep the hatch open . I need you here . You may have to drive the rig . ( GRUNTS ) You . You stay . You stay there . Whatever you do , you can 't be seen . I 'm supposed to be alone . That was the deal . Down here . Hey .

What wrong with that ? We are not things . ( GUNSHOT ) No ! ( GASPS ) Cheedo , we are not things ! We are not things . I don 't want to hear that again ! They were her words ! And now she 's dead ! THE DAG : Wring your hands . You 're not going back to him . Angharad ! Come on ! Come on ! So , um ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) Where is this ... This green place ? It 's a long night 's run , heading east . Hm . We need inventory . I want you to match every gun with its bullets . I 'm gonna go down and do some repairs . We need someone down the back . I 'll go . No . I want you to stay together . I can do it . ( SOBBING ) What are you doing here ? He saw it . He saw it all . My own blood bag driving ' the rig that killed her . Stop doing that . Shh , shh , shh . Stop . Thr ... three times the gates were open to me . What gates ? I was awaited in Valhalla . They were calling my name . I should be walking with the immorta , mcfeasting with the heroes of all time . I 'd say it was your manifest Destiny not to . I thought I was being spared for something great . I got to drive a pursuit vehicle . For a while even Larry and Barry stopped chewing on my windpipe . Who are Larry and Barry ? My mates . Larry and Barry . If they don 't get me , then the night fevers will . Well , we 've only got four for big boy here , so he 's all but useless . But we can squirt off this little pinky a raunchy 29 times . Angharad used to call them antiseed . Plant one and watch something die . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) ( GUITAR THRASHING ) ( THRASHING CONTINUES ) ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline , 19 canisters of nitro , 12 assault bikes , 7 pursuit vehicles .

The war boy ! Where did he come from ? ! THE DAG : I thought we threw him off the rig ! T-there 's high ground just beyond that thing . He means the tree . Yeah . Tree ! Leave him to me . Say , anyone notice that bright light ? Encroaching gunfire ? Get out . I-I can do this . I know this machine . CAPABLE : He does . He 's a revhead . You 've got two left . On him .

( GRUNTS ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( ENGINE HISSING ) I never thought I 'd do something as shine as that . How are the engines ? Very hot and real thirsty . Hey . You need to take the war rig half a click down the track . What if you 're not back by the time the engines have cooled ? Well , you keep moving . ( MACHINE GUN FIRING IN DISTANCE ) What do you suppose he 's gonna do ? Retaliate first . Let 's go ! ( GUNFIRE CONTINUES IN DISTANCE ) ( EXPLOSION ) ( BIRDS CAWING ) Oh . TOAST : Are you hurt ? Huh ? You 're bleeding . ( GRUNTS ) That 's not his blood . ( LIQUID POURING ) What is this ? It 's mother 's milk . ( BIRDS CAWING ) It 's okay . Sleep . Get some rest . How do you know this place even exists ? I was born there . So why 'd you leave ? I didn 't . I was taken as a child . Stolen . You done this before ? Many times . Now that I drive a war rig ... This is the best shot I 'll ever have . And them ? They 're looking for hope . What about you ? Redemption . ( BRAKES SQUEAL ) Hey , what 's that ? I remember something like that . WOMAN : Help me ! ( SOBBING ) Help me ! Help me , please ! Uh-oh . Please ! That 's bait . ( SOBBING ) Stay in the rig . Hurry ! Please , hurry ! They 'll be back ! I am one of the vuvalini ! Of the many mothers ! My initiate mother was k.T. Concannon ! I am the daughter of Mary jabassa . My clan was swaddle dog ! ( WHOOPING ) ( ENGINES REVVING ) It 's me . There 's something in the eyes . Perhaps it is jabassa 's child . This is our furiosa . How long has it been ? 7,000 days . Plus the ones I don 't remember . Furiosa . What happened to your mother ? She died . On the third day . From where did you come ? The west . Citadel . Beyond the mountains . The men ... Who are they ? They 're reliable . They helped us get here . Oh . Where did you find such creatures ? So soft . This one has all her teeth . ( LAUGHS ) Oh ! ( BOTH LAUGHS ) I can 't wait for them to see it . See ? See what ? Home . The green place . But if you came from the west , you passed it . The crows . The creepy place with all the crows . The soil . We had to get out . We had no water and ... The water was filth . It was poisoned . It was sour . ( ECHOING ) And the crows came . ( ECHOING ) We couldn 't grow anything . TOAST : ( ECHOING ) Where are the others ? V-GILLIAN : font color = " # D900D9 " ( ECHOING ) What others ? The many mothers . We 're the only ones left . ( SCREAMS ) Look . V-MELITA : That 's what you call a satellite . TOAST : Miss giddy told us about those . They used to bounce messages across the earth . Shows . Everyone in the old world had a show . Do you think there 's still somebody out there ? Sending shows ? Who knows ? Those are the plains of silence . Stay right where you are , little Joe . Kind of lost its novelty out here . You having a baby ? Warlord Jr . Gonna be so ugly . It could be a girl . You kill people with that , do ya ? Killed everyone I ever met out here . Headshots , all of ' em . Snap . Right in the medulla . Thought somehow you girls were above all that . Come here . Take a peek . Seeds . These are from home . Heirlooms . The real thing . I plant one every chance I get . Where ? So far , nothing 's took . Earth 's too sour . Ah , so many different kinds . Trees , flowers , fruit . Back then , everyone had their fill . Back then , there was no need to snap anybody . Can I talk to you ? I 've talked with the others . We 're never gonna have a better chance to make it across the salt . If we leave the rig here and load the motorcycles up with as much as we can , we can maybe ride for 160 days . One of those bikes is yours . Fully loaded . You 're more than welcome to come with us . I 'll ... I 'll make my own way . ( SIGHS ) You know , hope is a mistake . If you can 't fix what 's broken , you 'll , uh you 'll go insane . ( GIRL WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ) ( ECHOING ) Where are you , Max ? Where are you ? Help me . Help us . You promised to help us . Come on , pa . Let 's go . All right . This is your way home . We go back ? Mm . Back ? Yeah . I thought you weren 't insane anymore . What are they saying ? He wants to go back from where they came . The citadel . And what 's there to find at the citadel ? Green . TOAST : And water . There 's a ridiculous amount of clear water . And a lot of crops . It 's got everything you need , as long as you 're not afraid of heights . Where does the water come from ? He pumps it up from deep in the earth . Calls it aqua cola and claims it all for himself . And because he owns it , he owns all of us . I don 't like him already . It 'll take two weeks to skirt the wall of mountains . MAX : No . I suggest we go back the same way we came . Through the canyon . It 's open . We know that . Right ? He brought all his war parties through . So we take the war rig and we charge it right through the middle of them . We can decouple the tanker at the pass . Shut it off behind us . Kaboom ! ( LAUGHTER ) And how exactly do we take the citadel ? Assuming we 're still alive by then ? If we can block the pass , it 'll be easy . All that 's left are his war pups and war boys too sick to fight . CAPABLE : And we 'll be with nux . He 's a war boy . He 'll be bringing us home , bringing back what 's stolen , as he 's meant to . NUX : Yeah . It feels like hope . V - MELISSA : I like this plan . We can start again . Just like the old days . Look , it 'll be a hard day . But I guarantee you that 160 days riding ' that way , there 's nothin ' but salt . At least that way , you know , we might be able to ... Together ... Come across some kind of redemption . ( HUMMING ) ( INSECTS BUZZING ) LOOKOUT : War rig ! That 's the war rig ! That 's them . Why are they going back ? Do they wish to surrender ? They are heading for the canyon . They 're going back to the citadel ! They know it 's undefended ! Bullocks ! ( ENGINES REVVING ) Roll up ! Roll up ! ( GUITAR THRASHING ) Go ! ( WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ) What are you doing ?

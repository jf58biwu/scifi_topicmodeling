 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Fitz , it 's been 10 years . We can 't waste any more time . Alisha came to us . She was worried about her friends . Nobody saw that attack coming . [ Screaming ] Lincoln : His name 's James . He was never given powers . - That 's Kree . - What does it do ? Well , if I could figure that out , I would be doing that instead of this . He connects to the Inhumans , and they instantly joined the hive . I have to get back to the base . They have something we need . [ Rumbling ] [ Metal creaking ] 3x18 - " The Singularity " [ Alarm blaring ] [ Music ] - Man : All right , hold on ! Hold on ! - Man # 2 : Almost there ! [ Shouts indistinctly ] - How 's it coming ? - Just needs a quick reboot . [ Generator humming ] Thank you . - Tests come back ? - Daisy 's the only one infected . So Joey and Elena ... Touched down at the Cocoon . But Lincoln ... Refused to leave . I know . - How 's he holding up - No one comes to me with their feelings . Yeah , that makes sense . What about the base ? Still working on fortifying it . In the meantime , all vital data 's - been transferred to Zephyr One . - And we 're easy prey . Daisy could lead that giant maggot here any second . - I thought he was a parasite . - Yeah , but aren 't maggots ... - I don 't really ... - Me either . My take ? That thing could care less about S.H.I.E.L.D. - You think this because ... ? - No one 's digging any graves . We both know Daisy 's strength , what she could 've done . Mack : Yeah , she took the Terrigen and that ancient Kree whatever it is . And then she left . Yeah , but not before she busted the hydraulics on the hangar doors . We lost our exit . Because she doesn 't want us to follow her . Daisy 's my partner . I should 've known . I should 've seen ... Don 't . We 've all taken enough beatings as it is . I noticed Coulson wasn 't in the med bay . - He shouldn 't be up and around . - He 's readying the Zephyr . You saw the bone sticking out of his leg , right ? - I mean , he should be ... - Resting ? I told him that . Didn 't sit well . - He said he needs everyone in the air . - The hangar doors are still jammed . We managed to pry them open halfway , but until I get a new feed pump , we 're grounded . Not necessarily . Coulson has another way . But it 's risky and irresponsible . Then , why are you smiling ? Daisy 's still one of us . What she did here was not of her own free will . Hive infected her . She 's his hostage . We need to remember that . But this alien creature messed with the wrong team . It thinks if it breaks our legs , we 'll stop fighting , but it doesn 't know how damn stubborn we are , especially when it comes to protecting our own . Hive is building an Inhuman army , but we 're not gonna let that happen . So strap in . Because you might feel a little sick after this . You came here often . I see why . I was a different person the last time I was here . That 's how you know about this place , right ? 'Cause I told my S.O. ? You used to drive your van up here to sleep . You don 't just have his face . You have his memories . - He was fond of you , Grant Ward . - And I 'm glad he 's dead . He is , too . In a way . Grant was a thirsty soul . And he suffered for it . You 're so different from him . Just being around you , I can feel it . It 's like this emptiness I 've always had is gone . Coulson : You 're saying Daisy 's addicted to this thing ? It 's the closest scientific explanation that we 've got . She said she was happier than she 's ever been . Wanted me to experience the same thing . Most parasites have one goal ... attack and weaken its host . But Hive does the opposite . Its parasites swarm the brain 's pleasure center , - releasing so much dopamine that ... - Infected Inhumans not only feel - bulletproof , they actually are . - Well , at least when it comes to a dendrotoxin . - We took tissue samples from Lucio and ... - So ICERs don 't work on them . - No . - I 'm afraid not . Okay . Then , how do we disinfect Daisy ? Well , meet Dr. Holden Radcliffe , a fellow Scotsman . He was lead researcher on parasitic organisms at the agrochemical lab we raided . Based on his expertise , we believe he 's our key to finding a cure for Daisy . That facility and everyone in it were wiped clean . How did Radcliffe escape ? He didn 't have to , ' cause he wasn 't actually there . He was asked to step down a month before - for conducting irregular experiments . - " Irregular " meaning ... ? - He 's a rumored transhumanist . - A what ? People who believe in using science and technology to transcend our biological limitations . - Their goal is ... - Become more than human . Timely . Digital immortality , superintelligence ... Okay , I 'm glad everyone knows what it is . - So , where is Dr. Radcliffe ? - We think Romania , but his exact whereabouts are unknown . Okay . That 's enough to go on . You two are taking point . I 'll send Mack with you to run back-end , whatever you need . Just find Dr. Radcliffe and get us a cure . - You 're awfully quiet . - Just got a lot on my mind . - I 'll see you in the Quinjet , buddy . - Yeah . Uh , Jemma , uh , I know it 's not a good time , but can we speak about what happened between us last night ... - professionally speaking , I mean . - Of course , Dr. Fitz . We are colleagues , after all . That we are , Dr. Simmons , and , um ... that we are . It 's that working relationship which I would like to keep intact . Yes , we wouldn 't want anything to interfere with it . Exactly . Um , so , that 's why , as ... as ... as things progress with our , um ... We should consider all variables as we move forward , because things are bound to get ... complicated . You mean once we have sex ? - May : Simmons . - Gosh , I 'll see you in the Quinjet . [ Sighs ] Here . Remember your training . But we 're just going to have a chat with a scientist . [ chuckles ] - And how would I ever know if I need to ... - If it makes sense here . Sorry . I 'm not sure where you 're pointing . Your gut . You think they 'll come after you ? - I don 't know . Coulson , he 's ... - A driven man . - Especially when it comes to you . - He thinks I need protecting . It 's a shame he doesn 't know how strong you are , Skye . But your home is with me now . It 's ... It 's actually Daisy . My name is Daisy . - Grant knew you as ... - Yeah , I changed it . Or I guess you could say I ... found it . It was the name they always intended for me . Who ? I got so used to being alone , you know ? And then my dad made good on his word , and for a second , I had parents . Ones who wanted me . They weren 't what I imagined , but they were real . Not some fantasy that I drummed up , you know ? - But it didn 't end well . - I just ... I don 't have parents anymore . I 'm sorry . I don 't know why I 'm telling you all this . Connection . You and I are one organism now . Look , this is real world , Coulson . Malick 's intel is actionable . I have some other matters to attend to . What could possibly be more important ? This is Hydra we 're talking about . You started this , Director . You need to see it through . You have all the resources you need . Update me as you learn more . Update ... - Feel like sharing ? - If it becomes a thing , I 'll let you know . - You didn 't tell him about Daisy . - No , I didn 't . So you think they 'll go after Alisha ? After Lash killed one of her doubles , I put her in protective housing to give her time to recover . Hypothetically , I 'm the only one who knows where she is , but ... Daisy has her ways . And Alisha 's four Inhumans for the price of one . We need to get to her before Hive does . Humans , especially those with war in their hearts , presume I want an army . But there 's no need for war when everyone shares a common goal . And after we 're finished ... there will be no more war . No more pain . Especially now that we 're together . It 's time we took back this planet . Make it the home Inhumans have always deserved . _ Simmons : Under the communist regime , public gatherings were prohibited in Bucharest , and people were forced to meet in private homes or secret clubs . Satellites caught Dr. Radcliffe entering one of those old clubs an hour ago . We think transhumanists have turned it into a ... upscale black market for emerging technologies . - Oh , good . - So Simmons and I will pose as top-level geneticists looking to make a sale . Okay , but , remember , this is a high-class establishment , so you got to dress the part , which means no lab coats on this one . Well , do you think scientists only wear lab coats ? - Are we wearing them now ? - Yeah . What , we walk around all day - with goggles and gloves on , do we ? - I 'm sorry . Well , like you , Radcliffe 's not easy to please . He has refined tastes when it comes to human modifications . Yeah , and he 's also a known recluse , which is why I 'm hoping these little cybernetic bad boys will pique his interest enough to get him out of his shell . They 're a variation of what 's inside Deathlok . That 's a different kind of carrot on a stick . Innovation 's the quickest way to a scientist 's heart . If we can get him to appreciate what we do , - hopefully , he 'll help us with Daisy . - Yeah , and if that doesn 't work , you can go and beat him up and drag him out , 'cause all you are is big and strong , hmm ? Okay . Okay , I 'll never say another word about the lab coats again . All right , this room is our rendezvous point . - If we get Radcliffe ... - We bring him back here . - And if something goes wrong ... - We meet here . Good . 'Cause I 'm not ready to lose another teammate today . Lincoln , what are you doing ? Alisha and I are friends . She trusts me . Hive can infect you . You can 't come . - I won 't let him get to me . - You think you have a say in that ? - You think Daisy did ? - He 's coming . With one caveat . You want in , you wear this . - It 's lined with nano-thermites . - Nano-what ? - They 're miniscule explosives . - You want me to wear a suicide vest ? It 's only if Hive infects you . And , technically , a suicide vest is something you control . - So it 's a murder vest . - This watch is the trigger . - Phil . [ Sighs ] - If Hive gets its hands on him ... I go kaboom ? That 'd make you both real happy , wouldn 't it ? Then you 'd get Daisy back , and the three of you can live as one small , messed-up family again ? - It 's a last resort . - It 's insane . I want your help . I need it . But if Hive sways you , that 's it . No one 's gonna force you to do anything you don 't want to do . That 's the whole point . But if you want in the field , then this is a risk you 've got to be willing to take . [ Mid-tempo music plays ] [ Indistinct conversations ] What is it ? Do I look weird ? I feel a bit weird all dressed up like this . No . You look nice . That 's all . [ Glasses whir ] Mack , do you have a visual ? Affirmative . I see what you see . Turn on multi-spectral imaging . All right . [ Monitor whirs , beeping ] I don 't know what I expected , but ... this is not what I expected . Let 's just say most of the people in this room are more than what they seem . You two stay alert . I 'm not sure what you 're walking into . [ Music ] Looks clear from out here . Lincoln ? Lincoln : I 'm in position by Alisha 's car . - You take the stairwell . I 'll follow you in . - What happens if they show up ? - We neutralize Hive and extricate Daisy . - It 's that simple , huh ? We 'll figure it out . We always do . - And if Daisy won 't come quietly ? - What are you getting at ? This is a potentially volatile situation , and I need to know what you expect from me . [ scoffs ] You 're always so quick to the trigger , you know that ? Excuse me ? If you 're asking whether you shoot Daisy , the answer 's no . Daisy is not Andrew . I pull the trigger because you order me to . You 're the Director . I didn 't ask for the kill switch to Lincoln 's vest . You gave it to me . Because somehow , sacrificing him is okay with you . - That 's not what I meant . - I 'll do your dirty work , Phil , but don 't you dare pretend your hands are clean . [ Elevator bell dings ] Lincoln ? How 'd you know where I was ? - Have you seen Daisy recently ? - No . Why ? I thought they 'd come for you . How you been , James ? Oh , you know , just catching up on my soaps . What brings you out here to the middle of nowhere ? Did you break things up with blondie ? You 're looking for a lap to cry on ? - Are you drunk ? - Well , I 'm Australian , so yes . [ Scoffs ] Who 's Aladdin ? This is actually the ancient Inhuman you were telling me about . Thought you two should meet . Lincoln : He looks like Grant Ward , but he is most definitely not Grand Ward . I know it sounds crazy , but he controls Inhumans , forces us to do things we wouldn 't otherwise do . I can keep you safe , but ... [ Electricity crackles ] You 're not the first one we 've paid a visit to . But don 't worry . I didn 't forget about you . Hey , flower , I get that you 're attracted to danger . I know the type . But if Jiaying feared this guy , it was probably for a reason . James . Daisy showed me the Kree artifact you gave her , and it 's missing its companion piece . - But you already knew that . - What ? No , no , no , no . I ... I gave this chickadee everything . I swear on my nana 's life . I-I-I 'm not the type to sell you some bill of goods . And that reminds me of a story that I think you 'll particularly dig , ' cause it 's absolutely ... The hell ? You talk too much . [ Groaning ] [ Screaming ] We don 't want to have to hurt you . We want you to join us . Hang tight , Lincoln . I 'm almost there . - Coulson . - On my way . [ Tires screeching ] There 's no reason for you to stay loyal to humans . They 're a lesser species . Lesser species , my ass ! Where 's the original ? We can find her and ... [ grunts ] Lincoln : Stop ! Gun down ! Now ! [ Electricity crackles ] - Don 't . - Where 's Daisy ? Aah ! Tell me now , or I swear to God , I 'll make her suffer ! We can 't . Hive won 't let us . I just need to get her back . Whatever it takes . No . No . Oh , my God . Wh-Why would you ... ? - You made us . - No ! [ Gunshot ] [ Gasps ] No . I lost them . I lost them . S.H.I.E.L.D. came looking ? Is Lincoln alive ? Good . - And how do you feel ? - Happy to make the sacrifice . Now rest up . We need your strength . James is breaking out of his husk , like , in a really aggressive way . Aah ! Aah ! Oh , no ! What 's happening ? ! Aah ! My insides , they 're on fire ! Oh . Oh , crap . I ... I didn 't mean to ... [ Grunts ] Guess you won 't be needing all that C-4 anymore . My ... my hands ! Everything I touch ... [ Groaning ] [ Panting ] - Thank you . - Now ... we can 't leave here - until you give us the missing ... - I buried it . [ Rumbling ] [ Panting ] So , what is it ? The only thing that can destroy me . Simmons : Well , that 's a rather ominous thing to say . It 's true . These guys keep staring at us . Or maybe they 're staring at the case . Well , they could work for Dr. Radcliffe , presuming he 's even here . We 've looked everywhere . There 's only one way to find out . Excuse me . Looking for Dr. Holden Radcliffe . - We 're scientists . - Hello . My name is Anon . Do you have an appointment with the doctor ? Not exactly . We 're fellow geneticists . Like Dr. Radcliffe , we dabble in ... human enhancements . Mack : Guys , this woman has been heavily modified , in ways you wouldn 't anticipate . Mm , man , I need to get out more . Are you a patient of Dr. Radcliffe ? We have ... quite innovative eye technology . - Perhaps it will serve you , as well . - I can take it to the doctor . Respectfully , it 's for Dr. Radcliffe . Or no one at all . [ Screen whirs , beeping ] Wait in the bar area . If the doctor expresses interest , I will find you . Lincoln : Doesn 't make any sense . Alisha never would 've killed herself . She feels all of it . Every death . It 's Hive . That thing forced her . We 've got to stop it . I 'm taking you out of the field until Fitz-Simmons find a cure . What ? No . Look , I ... I know I went overboard today , and I 'm sorry . Without Daisy , I ... - I 'll do better . Please . - She 'd want me to keep you safe . - You can 't do this . - I just did . You 're sitting in here for the view ? You haven 't given me a destination . That 's ' cause I don 't have one . - How you holding up ? - Just another day at the office . I 'm sorry about earlier . I was out of line . I 'm frustrated with the ... We all are . You 're not the only one who cares . I know . And you 're right . The things I expect of you ... On some level , I 'm no better than Hive . - No one forces me to do anything . - I took advantage . When it comes to Daisy , she 's young . I forget that sometimes . And from what Fitz-Simmons have said , Hive 's infections only heightens feelings she already has . Daisy 's always longed for a family , for connection . I thought I could give it to her with S.H.I.E.L.D. Phil ... - ... you 're not her father . - No . But she 's the closest thing I have to a daughter . Anderson : Sir ? You told me to monitor any unusual seismic activity . - We found ... - Where ? - South Dakota . - They 're after the potential Inhuman . Mack , are you getting feedback on comms ? - Simmons , you hear that ? - Oh , yeah , it 's terribly loud . Probably best if we go offline to reboot . Mack : Looks fine on my end . Back in a jiff . [ Watches beep ] [ Sighs ] Got a long history of unfinished conversations , so ... - I thought it was about time that ... - We finish one . So , um ... I 've been thinking about it ... about us ... and , um ... it clicked . The crux of our relationship is like the singularity in transhumanism . - It is ? - Yeah , think about it . Singularity is the defining moment . The point at which a measurable variable becomes infinite . Right . So , our friendship is linear . - It 's simple , comfortable . - Effortless , really . As soon as we deviate from that path ... - Change becomes exponential . - The point of no return . Just to be clear , um ... are you comparing us sleeping together to crossing the event horizon ? Yeah . It 's quite lovely when you think about it like that . - And also terrifying . - Yeah , exactly . So ... - ... we should stop thinking altogether ... - And just do . Yeah . Of course . Anon : Hello . Please follow me . [ Glasses whir ] Back online and on the move . Mack : Copy that . [ Music ] This wasn 't in the schematics . You first . Are we meeting Dr. Radcliffe ? [ Button beeps ] [ Motor whirring ] After you . I 'm not sure we understand . You are looking to sell the doctor eye technology , are you not ? - Yes , but ... - The doctor will meet you once I 've seen the surgery is complete and your cybernetic eye is in place . Surgery . You want us to remove ... - And replace it with ... - Dr. Radcliffe needs assurance that your technology meets his standards . The only way to do this is to test it on a live human specimen . Whenever you 're ready . Uh , can you give us a minute to prep ? This seems extremely unethical . We 've done far more questionable things for our employer . A third opinion would be welcome . Well , if Radcliffe 's our only way to cure Tremors , you know where I stand . Then it 's decided . All right , sir , I 'm just going to need to numb the area before we begin . Okay . You might feel a slight pinch . [ Gasps ] Jemma . Ugh . What kind of a sick game is this ? - Simmons , what 's going on ? - It 's a prosthetic . Well , you certainly weren 't afraid you were wrong . - What tipped it ? - That your eye 's not entirely human . What ? Mammals don 't have ciliary muscles in their vascular layer , but that eye does , so what is it ? - Some kind of avian hybrid ? - Why would ... Why would you ... Birds ' visual acuity is superior to mammals . - I was envious . - But I don 't ... Why all the ... Smoke and mirrors ? It 's a fair question . To put it simply , I 'm selective about who I work with . I believe that art and science are entwined . The devil , and God , is in the details . I don 't want people to see my work and know it 's work . If they give a second glance , I want it to be out of awe , not disgust . May I ? - May : You really are a stubborn bastard . - That 's why we get on so well . I 'm telling you , it 's fine . It doesn 't even hurt . - Check the perimeter . - I 'll take point . [ Wood creaking ] They 've unearthed something . Radcliffe : I can see how its surveillance capabilities are appealing . But there was a company that had something eerily similar . Cybertek . Heard of them ? - Turns out they were Hydra . - We 're not Hydra , I assure you . They connected explosives to soldiers ' eyes . Violence for violence 's sake , an ugly misuse of science . - We 're S.H.I.E.L.D. - Same thing . No . That 's a common mistake , actually . - Mack . - You 're on comms with someone . [ Feedback ] [ Keyboard clacking ] Please stop . Listen , we know about the research you were conducting . You were genetically engineering animals that can resist parasites , which is quite appropriate , really , because ... Well , there 's a man-eating parasite on the loose . It can inhabit dead humans and control Inhumans . - It can force ... - Inhumans ? They 're real ? - Take them . - They 're not welcome here . - Stop . - No , hold on . H-Hold on . Dr. Radcliffe ! Jemma ! I 'll meet you at the rendezvous point ! Fitz ! Aah ! Aah ! [ Panting ] You have to hear me out . We 're chasing our own damn tail . Coulson . [ Explosives beeping ] Clear the area . This place is rigged to blow . We got to get out of here . - There 's no time . - Then , get in . [ Rapid beeping ] [ Coulson grunting ] - When did you ... - I thought it would be cool if the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. had a shield . - Fitz agreed , so ... - Handy . Okay . The leg hurts a little . Maybe you should get a cybernetic one . Too soon . [ Cellphone rings ] You gonna get that ? [ Cellphone beeps ] - Coulson ! - Talbot ? This isn 't a good time . Fitz : You have to listen to me . Yes , Inhumans are real . But that 's barely scratching the surface , 'cause I 've stood on alien soil , and I 've jumped through a portal to get there . So if it 's discovery that you want - and the science behind it ... - It 's both . It 's all of it . Okay , well , I can give you that . But first I need your help . Okay ? ' Cause ... [ Breathing heavily ] ... you 're the only one that can save my friend . [ Grunts ] Stop ! I 'm ... I 'm not going anywhere without Fitz ! [ Screams ] You once said the same thing about me . Whoo ! [ Chuckles ] [ Grunts ] Hey , hey . _ I just wanted a little sip . I didn 't know you were an officer of the law . You think you 're some kind of designer humans , huh ? But you 're just playing dress-up . You 'll never be able to do it . Well ... [ Screaming ] What ? He started it . Stop ! You 're that Inhuman . Where 's Daisy ? ! That bird has so many male suitors . And what are your muscles made out of ? Me ? Anon . Take him . No . Wait ... [ groans ] We need to talk . Stay the hell away from me ! - If you try to hurt me , I swear ... - Yeah , I 'm doom . You 're hope . Remember ? [ Voice breaking ] Will ? No , it 's not ... [ Breathing shakily ] it 's not possible . Never been able to resist doing something when the odds are impossible . Now , I want your honest opinion on this . What do you think of the name " Inferno " ? I like it , but I don 't love it . Firestarter ? Well , feels a little ' 90s . And Burning Man ... I mean , that would 've been perfect if it wasn 't for some bloody desert hippy fest . How about Blowhard ? Daisy : I don 't have much time . [ Panting ] This isn 't you . We can ... - What are you ... - Stop trying to save me . Daisy ... I know what I 'm saying . I know what I feel . I finally have a family , Fitz . You don 't need to pity me anymore . Hive : It happened so quickly . The storm , the portal opening . I guess you were right about Fitz , huh ? - Stop it . - Jemma , listen . I 'm glad you made it back to him . All I want is for you to be happy . Safe . That 's why I 'm glad we 're here now . I never got a chance to say goodbye . I don 't want anything bad to happen to you , I swear , but you and Simmons ... well , I 've seen the future , and someone in S.H.I.E.L.D. is gonna die . [ Chokes ] And if you love her , you will leave us alone . - I 'm the only thing protecting you . - No , that 's not ... He said you 'd do anything to fool me . Jemma , please . I wouldn 't trick you . I don 't want you to end up dead like me . We ... don 't want that to happen to you . - It 's in your best interest ... - ... to stay away . We don 't want to hurt you ... any of you . But we will . [ Chokes ] This is your last warning . Next time , I snap your neck . [ Gasps , breathing heavily ] It 's time to let me go . Just because you stole Will 's memories doesn 't give you the right to be him . Will is dead . [ Gunshots ] [ Groans ] HQ is fortified . Nothing 's getting in here . It 's a thing . This is why Talbot 's been so bent out of shape . - Malick 's intel ? - He gave us everything . You mess with a man 's family , all bets are off . - I don 't think aliens get that . - What are you saying ? We 're about to take down Hydra 's infrastructure . Want to watch ? Talbot : All units in position , Director . Two mikes to launch . Roger that . HQ has visual . - All stations report . - Man : Echo 1 ... on your order . Woman : Red 6 ... prepping to breach . Man # 2 : QJ 4 ... locked in and ready . All operations a go . Commence DECAP . [ Sighs ] Oh . Thank God . Is Fitz with you ? - [ Sighs ] No . - But this is the rendezvous point . Wait . H-Hold on , hold on . I just got back . He can 't be too far behind . Plus , if you go out there looking for him and he comes back here , then this will go on all night . [ Sighs ] Mack : You okay ? You see Daisy ? [ Sighs ] Hive ... or whatever it is . I shot him . Doubt it did anything . Always said I 'd shoot Ward . - You think we 'll get her back ? - We have to . [ Sighs ] I guess sometimes it 's easier to think the world wants you to suffer than to believe it 's got your back . You should tell that to Fitz . He thinks we 're cursed , which I know is ridiculous , but ... I don 't know . - So , how long have you two ... ? - Oh , no . No , we 've ... It 's not ... You know how many times Bobbi and Hunter pulled the " my comms are broken " trick ? Come on . Right . Well , I ... I don 't know . I ... I suppose it 's very new . No , it isn 't . [ Chuckles ] [ Explosions ] Talbot : All stations , targets secure . The head has been cut . I repeat ... the head has been cut . Hydra has been eliminated . Just like that . Just like that . This should 've been a great day . [ Sighs ] Jemma ? - Where have you been ? - Looking for you . Oh , well , I 've been here at the rendezvous point like we discussed . - What ? And Mack ? - In the Quinjet , unloading equipment . Well , we 've got a lot to talk about . [ Music ] - Jemma . - Yeah ? Your hands are freezing . [ Laughs ] Are they ? Ooh . They 're like little ice buckets , aren 't they ? [ Chuckles ] Do you think you can brave it ? I 'll do my best to power through . Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . All right , then what about " Hellfire " ? It 's better than " Scorch , " but I 'm worried it 's too much . Hive : You 're a difficult man to find , doctor . You 're Inhuman ... all of you . Well , technically , I 'm one of the first genetically altered human beings on the planet . Scientifically , humans have advanced almost to the level the Kree reached when they made me . You , doctor , seem to be the closest . Very flattering , and I agree . But genome editing ... we 've only just begun that kind of DNA modification . To ... To make something of your kind , that 's ... we can only ... dream . You don 't need to dream anymore . We are one organism , seeking change . And with your help , we 're going to redefine humanity . - Permanently . - Is that even possible ? - H-How could you ... - By re-creating the same Kree experiment that was done to me . And this is where it all begins . - Bought us a house ? - No . I bought us a whole town .

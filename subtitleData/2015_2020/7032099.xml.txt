 Maybe we should take Mungo back to the others . We can 't take him back like that . They might wanna wash him . I 'm not sure how they do it or what they do , but ... you know . Can 't fix much of it , but we can get rid of the blood . Some of it , at least . How can you kick a kid in the face ? You can if you think he 's a monster . They 're stronger , faster . Warriors who 've survived hundreds of thousands of years . We call them subhuman , but biologically , they 're better than us . Deep down , we know that . That 's why we fear them . We don 't have to be afraid anymore . Cut to the chase , Mr. West . Project Madisterium . One simple dose creates instant cellular mutation . The hair loss begins almost immediately . Within hours , the hair 's completely gone , along with their speed and strength , potentially even their extended lifespan . Are you telling me this creature 's become human ? Subhuman . Ready to be assimilated . But , Mr. West , not so long ago , you were arguing for Hairy rights . My intent remains the same , it 's just the method that 's changed . Jarrod Slade and I share a vision , Minister ... A way to heal the wounds between the species . The Inclusion Initiative will give us a real opportunity for humans and Hairies to live peacefully side by side . In return , your government backs their entire welfare program . Where I 'm from , that 's called being screwed twice . With respect , Minister , that shows a lack of vision . The initiative means Hairies are no longer a threat to humans . The genetic testing of the general public comes to an end . Hairies can live freely and safely in an open , assimilated society . And the face of that initiative ... A respected blackfellow who wants nothing more than unity . Where I 'm from , that 's called a win-win . Well , that 's quite a sales pitch . But how long until this Project Madisterium can be tested on live subjects ? It 's already begun . They 'll start knocking on doors soon . And you 'll tell them we 're family . - Well , she 's not gonna pass for a human . - Let ' em come . I 'll take care of them . There 's food in there on the table . It 's true about the door knocking . They 've been through before . They searched the place . - How many of them ? - Usually two , fully armed . Thorough search ? How often do they come ? Every three , four days . Unless something else triggers their interest before that . - Like a sighting ? - No , like the fact that I can 't swing another day off . My mate 's already on his way to pick me up . And you think I 'm stupid enough to let you leave ? Stupid is not the word I would use to describe you . The city is on lockdown . Everyone is jumpy . I need to act normal . I can buy more food on my way home . Why would you do that ? I wanna help you . No one wants to help us . Did hydrotherapy prove to be the promised cure-all ? Yes , I feel almost human . I thought you had an early start . Just wanted to make sure you were all right before I left . You needn 't even move off the couch today . - I recognize that look . - The hospital called . They need me back . I thought I might go and do half a day . My darling , I don 't wanna keep going on about it ... - But you think I should rest . - Both of you should . Just a little longer . Doctor 's orders . Well , I 'm the doctor . Shouldn 't I be the judge of that ? Charlotte ... we nearly lost the baby . You tell me if it 's worth the risk . And if I start climbing the walls ? Just make sure you find a safe way down . I better go . You call me if you need anything . - You at the network all day ? - Oh , yeah . Chained to my desk . Araluen . Tell me about the lovely Marion Frith . She 's in 100 % . No eyebrows raised about disposal of extracted waste products ? All to be delivered to Slade Industries for destruction , ensuring no toxic waste dumps . A responsibility that Slade Industries takes very seriously . The recycling will save mankind , just not quite in the way the greenies intended . I assured her the test subject would be ready for tonight 's announcement . He will be , mentally and physically . We should give him a new name . Or maybe ask him to choose one . Something harmless , reassuring . You could just assign him a number . Not exactly relatable . He needs a name in English . It 'll make people feel safer if they know the Hairies aren 't allowed to use their own language again once they 've been through the process . I could see you 're born to this . They have to act as human in all ways . Savor the moment , Waruu . We 're about to change the world . Oh , would you mind , Waruu ? Not at all . There . Facial recognition , 100 % . We need him found now . - I 'll find him . - And do it quietly . Don 't draw the CA 's or the public 's attention to what he is . - Latani ! - Araluen ! Djukara ! Latani ! - Djukara ! - Araluen . Latani was with us . We were busted out . - Latani escaped . - She 's still alive ? Djukara ? He was so brave , Araluen . A real warrior . I 'm sorry . ... Diaz reporting from the site of a raid by subhumans in which several courageous Containment Authority officers lost their lives . This was clearly a planned attack rather than an opportunistic one . Pressure is mounting on the government to crack down on these violent creatures who continue to prey on innocent humans . Taylor Diaz , Channel 12 News . This shows that the streets aren 't safe for any of you . - Yeah , right . - Please ... stay hidden . We can 't trust anyone anymore . Ordinary people did this . But I am here for you all , to keep you safe however I can . To make the city a better place for Hairies to live safe . - Just like everyone else . - They killed Mungo . We should kill them ! We don 't get to decide who lives or dies , Harry ! But if we wanna live side by side , everyone accepting everyone else , letting each other be , well , then we have to find another way . I 'm not sure what that looks like . You . You destroyed us ! Wake up ! Jyra ! That 's enough ! I am so sorry for your little girl . Let her be now , Koen . Is it alive ? Very much so . Let 's find out what else Cleverman blood can do . What we can do to it . - House keys ? - Same ring as the car keys . - He 'll come in if I don 't go out there . Look , I promise you guys I 'll come back . - And how many CA will you bring with you ? - I 'm telling the truth . I 'll come back alone . Ticktock , ticktock , buddy . - Yeah . - What happened to your head ? Don 't ask . Let 's get in the car . We 're running late . Paging Dr. Blair . Dr. Blair , please report to ICU . ... report to ICU . - Charlotte . - Hey , Deepak . I wasn 't expecting you back so soon . Oh , I couldn 't let you run outpatients all on your own . Are you sure you 're okay ? How many years you been telling me what I should do ? Twelve ... wait , no , 14 years . Oh , my God , you make me sound so old . - Well , you are old . - So rude . Anyway , I thought your OB ordered bed rest until next week . Are you conspiring with my husband , Deepak ? Can I get the , um , patients list for today ? Well , I wouldn 't blame him for treating you like glass . Oh , my God , that man is in a league of his own . I swear , he 'd lock me up if he could till the baby was born . Hey , I need a full workup ... Hormones , hemoglobin , iron , glucose , toxoplasmosis . Got it , we 'll run the gamut . The IDs are missing . What 's the patient 's name ? It 's for me , actually . I just wanna make sure everything 's running on track . We 'll make it a priority . And you can keep your name off the records . - No one else need know . - I appreciate it . No , we can 't have that . Um , Lucia can collect it when you 're done . - Oh ! - Oh , Christ , mate , are you okay ? - Is it broken ? - No , mate , you came out of nowhere . Hang on , hang on . Just come over here . - Tilt your head back , mate . Tilt your head back . - Okay . Oh , God , what happened ? Oh , mate , you came out of nowhere . Not a bad speech back there . I don 't wanna forgive anyone . Why should Araluen ? - I just wanna ... - Blast every one of them ? - Yeah , I do . - Well , not a bad start . Gotta say that blast hurt like hell . I 'm sorry , aunty . I 'm here , aren 't I ? All in one piece . - You did what needed to be done . They 're gonna pay . For Mungo . For Blair . - And for all the Hairies . - I hear you . But you can 't just hurl that thing around , knocking out whoever happens to be nearby . Oi . Come with me . Erythrocytes are round and flat . No sign of malformation . Hemoglobin and platelet levels , average . In other words , the Cleverman 's blood is completely normal . - Disappointingly so . - On the contrary . Normal cells can be destroyed . Try cancer . This isn 't possible . Neither is a man who can 't be killed , but such is the world we live in . The cancer 's gone . Try smallpox . Come on , show me the blast . Good . And again . You 'll be unstoppable with that power . Now , just control your anger . Someone kicks a kid to death in front of me ... I 'm gonna get emotional . Or maybe they murder my best friend . Yeah , I 'm gonna get angry . Lost count of how many of my people I 've seen killed . They don 't expect you to be chained to your desk on your first day , you know ? Give me a hand here ? Of course . Look , the success of the initiative 's gonna depend on making it as attractive as possible to the Hairies , which means , among other things , counteracting any propaganda there may be from Hairy sympathizers . - Agreed . - Is there any way for this office to access the government 's human ID data bank ? Keep an eye on the activity of suspected sympathizers . - May I ? - Of course . You now have access to everything the government knows about its citizenry . They might not let you out of here now . Heading off ? Yeah , taking your advice , getting some stuff delivered . - All good . - Just trying to get my head around this database . If someone , say , dead or missing , I mean , how is that listed ? Or do your records get deleted when you die ? Uh , dead will come up as deceased . No one 's records get deleted . They 'll be there for eternity . No escaping your misspent youth , Mr. West . Okay . Good . - - I don 't think I have much more left in me , Harry . How about we stop when you 're too tired to talk ? - What are you doing here ? - Get your hands off of me . Harry , let her go ! What did you see , huh ? Tell me ! - Let her go ! - No ! Do it ! - She 's seen too much . - Hey ! Hey . What are you saying , huh ? That we should kill her ? Or do you wanna rip off another finger ? I know he 's a Hairy , but what about you ? Pathology report you ordered . Thanks . What ? Hairy DNA ? Is there something you 're not telling me , Charlotte ? No , the lab got the samples contaminated . I have to do it again . Well , the DNA devices have just started coming into the lab for servicing . Well , no wonder there 's cross-contamination . Either that or you 've invested in a damn good razor . Ha , ha . - Hi , there . You 've reached - Charlotte Cleary . - Please leave a message . - End call . GPS , track phone location . Smallpox , tuberculosis , malaria , his blood destroyed them all . We 'll have to try something more potent . Ebola ? If that doesn 't work , I 've got one more trick up my sleeve . Make a start on it . I 'll be right back . - It feels good . - You sure ? I might stay the whole afternoon , actually . - I have a lot of things that I need to ... - Charlotte . Jarrod , what are you doing here ? I 'm here to ask you exactly that question . - We agreed you 'd stay home . - Well , I changed my mind . It 's not only up to you . Shouldn 't the welfare of our child be a decision for both of us ? I 'm in the safest place possible . Besides , it 's not like I don 't know what I 'm doing . I 'm doing everything I can to give our child the best life . She 'll live like no one has before . She ? Oh , our child 's a girl now , is it ? I think you should come home now . I 'll be home once my shift is finished . - We can discuss it then . - Charlotte , you 're coming with me . I will not be spoken to like that . And I won 't have the safety of our child jeopardized . - Gather your things . - I don 't work for you , Jarrod . You can 't order me to do anything . I think you better leave . Tell me . Ebola was no match for the subject 's blood . It 's destroying every disease known to man . We 'll have to try something not known to man . - - We should just go before he gets home . We 're not going anywhere until it 's fully dark . We wait . Shit , he 's here . Go hide , quick . Hide . Jesus , I come in peace . It 's okay . - - I brought food like I said I would . It 's all good . Proceed . - Sir ? - Classified , Everick . Any effect on the blood ? Cells unaffected as yet . Ten seconds in . The virus is being destroyed . Add another drop before the virus is completely annihilated . Another drop , Everick . Now . Add another drop . Sepsis . - Compromised . - It 's not possible . You 're suited . Slade . Slade , please ! Slade . Slade ! She has to come with us . We don 't know anything about her . Hey . What 's your name ? I 'm Koen West . I 'm not gonna hurt you . - Where do you wanna take me ? - You don 't ask the questions . Tell me . You seeing this ? Seeing what ? Where you going ? Will you hurry up with that ? I need to chain you back up before I go to sleep . Just leave the jacket . Take it . Mm . What are you playing at ? Was your husband at the zone , too ? Why did you give me this ? You might need it . No chains . - Thank you . - Just don 't push it . Huh . Hello ? Under the leadership of my predecessor , this ministry 's policy in dealing with Hairy threat was one of containment and removal . When I took office , the high level threat of domestic terrorism led to a necessary restriction of the civil liberties that we as a nation hold so dear . - Tonight , that policy comes to an end . With the assistance of Slade Industries , a groundbreaking medical procedure has been developed to minimize the physical threat of the Hairy people . - Mr. Slade ? - Thank you , minister . Scientific , ethical trials of this procedure have a proven 100 % success rate . Here you see a Hairy male before treatment . And now . I believe the results speak for themselves . What would you like your new name to be ? They call me Trevor . They call me Trevor . I am honored to announce the Inclusion Initiative , a nationwide welfare , education , and integration program developed by indigenous community leader , Waruu West . Once neutralized , the Hairy people will have the opportunity to attain the same standard of living as everyone else . Enjoy the same rights , privileges , responsibilities , - observe the same customs ... - No . - ... and join in the beliefs , hopes , and loyalties that are the very thing that make us human , and set us apart from the animals . This is the Hairy peoples ' chance to throw off the shackles of their primitive , aggressive existence . Minister . We look forward to welcoming all the Hairy peoples who volunteer for the Inclusion Initiative into a new way of life . We shall all be the richer for this assimilation . Who 's there ? Close your mouth , boy . Look like you 've seen a ghost .

You 're pathetic . Mom . Seven . How long are we gonna wait ? - We can go to sleep soon . - Yeah , I can 't sleep when I 'm waiting for someone to come home . Having a major case of déjà vu right now . Governors in 11 states have declared a state of emergency and requested the assistance of the national guard to quell riots and protests ... What 's wrong , Dad ? What the hell is going on ? You are not able to leave without proper clearance . Checkpoints have been established ... Sir ? We will shoot ! Get down ! Get down ! Everyone okay ? All right back there ? ... so desperately need to get help . Despite the fact that the citywide curfew is now in effect , we are still getting reports ... Talk to her . - What 's plan B , Liza ? - Another hospital . No , they will all be like that . Is there somewhere I can drop you ? - I-I want to help . - Like I helped you ?

I 'll call my cousin to come and get us , and then we will be even . - You can stop keeping score . - I was not the one to start . Dad ? So , what do we do if he doesn 't come back ?

All right , I 'm going . Mom , you know what 's out there . We can 't stay here . - I 'm not trying to be an asshole . - Good . - He went to get his ex-wife . - He went to get his son . Yeah , his family . I 'm just saying- - We 're his family . He 'll come home . Maybe he went home . You know that thing you were saying about not being an asshole ? - Hey , I 'm sorry . I just don 't- - - It 's happening again . - Is it Mr. Dawson ? - Shh . I don 't see anything . Okay , we need to get away from the windows . You need to tell Alicia what 's out there .

Travis ! Madison . Maddy ? - I asked you to wait in the car . - We 're staying with you . Looks like no one 's here , Dad . The car 's still in the driveway . Gotta be here . - Left , left , left , left . - Travis ! - Okay , right , left . - Travis ! - Dad . - Get back . Travis ? Liza , get Chris in the car now . Get out of here . Peter ? Hey , you 're sick . - Peter . Come on , Peter , it 's Travis . - Dad . - Dad , what are you doing ? - Get out of here ! - Dad ! - Travis ? Travis ! Travis ? Give me the gun . The shells . Where are the shells ? All right . Leave it , leave it . Let 's go . Travis , no ! Dad ! Dad ! - Dad ! - Peter , stop ! - Travis ! - No , put the gun down ! Move . What did you do ? Help !

Oh , my God . - Susan . - She 's sick . - Was she bitten ? - I can 't tell . She 's not sick . She 's dead . Well , that 's- - that 's not Matt . He- - he 's not like that . He- - he 's not like that . Mom , Matt 's not like that . That 's not him ! That 's not Matt ! Why would you say that ? Because it 's the truth . - Hey , let me see . - Mom can fix it . Come on . You know how many times I 've had my nose broken ? Yeah . Mom can fix it . Come on . Let me help . Yeah . Ow . All right ... Hold on . Yep . I don 't think it 's broken . What was wrong with that man , Dad ? That woman ? Uh ... people are getting sick . Will we ? You 're gonna be all right . We all will be . Okay ? Come on . We need to talk to everyone . I know , I know . How 's she doing ? You got anything I could give her for the pain ? Nothing stronger than aspirin . Um ... uh , the phone 's in the kitchen if you need to make that call . I did . My cousin is coming to pick us up in the morning . Uh , we 'll set up your mom in one of the bedrooms , okay ? - Thank you . - Aren 't we leaving ? Yeah , yeah , we will . In the morning . No , Travis , we have to go . We 're packed , we 're ready . We were just waiting for you . Can we talk about this in the kitchen ? No . This thing 's getting worse , not better . It 's not safe . - Madison , I think Travis is- - - No , it 's not your place- - - I don 't wanna stay . I don 't- - I wanna go . - Look- - - I wanna go . I don 't wanna stay here . - Hold on . Hold on . It is dark . We don 't even know if the freeway is passable . - You expect us to wait here ? - We 'd be blind out there . It 's dangerous . - And this isn 't ? - Inside , doors locked . We ride it out for the night , okay ? We 'll take care of each other . Trust me , Maddy . We 'll leave in the morning . If we 're staying here , you have to take care of Peter . You can get gas from the truck . - For what ? - To burn him . No . If you burn him , the sickness will not spread . We don 't know how it spreads . I understand . You knew this man . Yeah , I did . He didn 't deserve this . It 's true what you said ... they don 't die . They keep coming back . What ? It 's good , what you 're doing , helping that woman , Griselda . I 'm not helping her . Yes , you are , Liza . Give yourself a break . I gave myself a break , Travis , a long time . Turns out I can do a lot more things than I thought I could . I know . I mean , I-I always knew it . No ... you always said it . If I had seven years now , I could go to med school , be a doctor . It 's too bad , ' cause that 's what she needs . Forget the fractures , the lacerations . When the foot was crushed , the tissue began to die . And it will die . Infection will poison her blood . - Her organs will fail . - It won 't come to that . Oh , yeah ? Who 's gonna stop it , you ? Can 't fix everything , Travis . Well , you know what ? I 'm relieved . I thought it was gonna be awkward having two wives in the house . What 's happening ? What is this ? Something to survive . Okay , so , we should go with them tomorrow then , right ? No . ¿ Dónde , mamá ? We don 't know what 's happening . We can 't handle this on our own . - I can handle it . - Papa , we need help . - They can help us . - Tsk . Papa ? This is the wrong time to be in someone else 's debt . They are not family . Family- - like your cousin ? Oye . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Papa ... _ _ _ _ _ Hey , angel . Where 'd you get the pills ? I went back to school . Cops hadn 't cleared out the locker . Smart girl . I 'm gonna take enough to get Nick set in the desert , and then give the rest to that woman . Griselda , good . Hey ... I had to bring them . Of course . She was hurt . No ... they took us in Maddy . I 'm sorry about what Daniel did . He had to . I thought I lost you . No , you didn 't lose me . You 're never gonna lose me . I won 't leave you again . Who can sleep , right ? Look , I don 't wanna cause problems . Madison , I know we 're not friends ... I 'm saying this to you as a mother . We should support each other , you and me . The kids need it . They need reassurance right now , and- - I need something from you . That woman outside , that 's Susan . She watched my kids when I went to work . Took care of me after my husband died . Sounds like a good friend . She was . And if ever I end up like her , I need you to take care of it . Don 't make Travis do it . It would break him . Morning , Susan . These barrels have a cylinder bore choke , for a wider spread of the ammo . This is the brake . - Okay . - You load here . Thank you . These are # 8 birdshot . These are 00 buck . Those will stop something . Okay . - Feeling better ? - What the hell are you doing ? He 's just showing me the gun , Dad . - Finish packing the truck . - It 's not a big deal . Chris . Go . The more the boy knows , the safer he 'll be . - Uh-huh . - I didn 't see the harm , Trav . You know how I feel about guns . The gun doesn 't care how you feel about it . That 's enough . We ready to go ? Cars are loaded , yeah . I have one more thing to do . Susan . Maddy . Maddy . I was wondering where her husband is . Wondering what it 'd been like if you 'd come home last night , found me like this . When he comes home , finds her ... I didn 't find you like that . You think Patrick 's dead already ? You think he just- - he left and never came home ? I don 't know . What is she ? Susan . She 's your friend . All the more reason . - She 's dead . - We don 't know that . - I do . - We don 't know anything yet . What if even there 's the smallest chance that she can be helped ? It 's not your call . Give it to me before you do something that can 't be undone . Madison . _ I need a couple more . Mom . Please . - Is that all we have ? - Yep . I gave the rest to Griselda . Why ? She needs it . Mom , she 's a stranger . - She 's in pain . - So am I. I know . I 'm gonna help . I don 't need you , Mom . I need my medicine . - They 're leaving . - Good . This is insane . Papa , we have to go with them . No . Tell me what you 're afraid of . Nothing . You 're being stubborn , paranoid . You 're hurting Mama . _ She needs the nurse . I know Travis will let us go with him if we ask . Once they 're gone , I will go out , get a doctor . - He will come and treat your mother . - How ? Where you gonna find a doctor ? _ _ Mama ... _ Good people are the first ones to die . Alicia ! Come on . We 're going . Alicia , come on . - I heard you . - Let 's go , huh ? I had to pee . Patrick ! Patrick . Patrick , wait . No . No , no , no , no . Susan , I 'm home . The airport 's shut down . I drove all the way from Salt Lake . I tried to call you , but- - - Susan ? - Patrick ! Patrick ! Don 't touch her . That 's not your wife . What happened , Susan ? - What 's your name , sir ? - Uh , Travis Manawa . - This is your residence ? - Yes , my girlfriend 's house . - And what 's your name , ma 'am ? - Madison Clark . - How many occupants ? - Um , nine- - nine altogether . Big family . Uh , names , please ? I got Travis Manawa and , uh , Madison Clark . Uh , Nicholas Clark , Alicia Clark , Elizabeth Ortiz , Christopher Manawa . Um ... Daniel Salazar , Griselda Salazar , Ofelia Salazar . Okay , make sure that everyone in your family stays inside . Can you tell me where you took my neighbor , Patrick Tran ? Your neighbor was covered in the infected 's blood . It was his wife 's blood . That wasn 't his wife anymore . Is it contagious , the blood ? Is that how it happens ? Have you or anyone in this house been exposed ? No . What 's that ? Our dog died . Sorry to hear that . Folks , get back inside . We will come to you . Bravo two , bravo two . The cavalry 's arrived . It 's gonna get better now . ¿ Qué pasa ? _

 Previously on " Aftermath " ... There 's a piece of my research . You find it . You understand it . Maybe it helps you . I want my daughter . We offed that tasty little slice . Please no ! - What have you done ? - Devyn , don 't do this , please ! Devyn ! It 's overheated . It won 't start . We 're not even close to safety . No , we 're miles and miles away . What do we do ? I don 't think we have a choice . I mean , it won 't start until it cools down . We can carry on in my truck . There 's enough room . - Mm . - That 's a good idea . I 'll catch up with you once I get it running . But we 're not going without you . I can 't leave this . I can 't leave my research . I think it 's the best chance we have to get through all this . - Yeah . - Take the kids . We 're not going without you . You and Martin go . The mission 's still on . We 'll wait . She 's right . The mission is on . You 're stuck . I 'm gonna go , uh , look around . Hey . How are you doing ? Great , Dana . You know , I just killed somebody I loved , but thanks for asking . I 'm awesome . You didn 't kill him , Bree . I could have saved him . How ? Loving him more . Bree , don 't you think that 's ... a little bit unrealistic ? Really , Dana ? Unrealistic ? You want to go there ? How old 's your boyfriend ? What , like , 32 ? 28 . You know , I always thought that when you got started , it would be , like , some math guy or something , not some fling . He 's not a fling . Bree , look , I know you 're hurting . But none of us are to blame for this . Yes , we are ! It is my fault , Dana . I 'm the only one to blame . Devyn 's dead , and it 's on me . Poor girl . She cried all night . I 'm worried about her . - I 'm worried about you . - Why me ? What do you mean why you ? Yesterday you killed four people . You killed four people in Seattle . - You knew that ? - Of course . - Dana told me that night . - Why didn 't you mention it ? Look , it was a good plan . I 'm proud of you . What 's the plan for this ? The volcano could blow any second . We 're gonna get ten miles down the road and break down again . We just ... we 've got time . - Okay . - We could talk . Talk . Uh , yeah , no , I want to . I want to . Right after we 're out of this . Jeez , Mom , don 't you ever knock ? Wow . Wow . I 've never needed to knock . It 's my RV , is it not ? - Step forward , sir . - Welcome to my mother 's stare . I 've been getting it for years . I 'm okay with it . - We 'll see . What 's your name ? - Martin James Winters . How do you know Booner ? A Ranger buddy hooked me up six months ago . - You know a ranger ? - Did six years , ma 'am . - What 's your battalion ? - That 's classified . That 's right . Deployment ? - Iraq and Afghanistan . - Any tin ? Campaign medals , bronze star , purple heart . - Purple heart . Where ? - Right leg , ma 'am ... - Through and through . - Upper , lower ? - Upper . - Has she seen the scar ? Mom , yeah , I 've ... I 've seen the scar . Little girls like scars ' cause they don 't know any better . Mom , I 'm not a little girl anymore . - Are you playing with my daughter ? - No , ma 'am . Did you volunteer for this because of my daughter ? - Yes , ma 'am . - Why ? - Don 't answer that . - Answer that . Because she 's beautiful , ma 'am ... and very smart , and I can 't stop thinking about her . Yes , she is smart . What do you like about this guy ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , what he said . Plus , I 'm funny . I 'm funnier . She 's definitely funnier . There are a thousand ways to die ... you both know that . If Dad doesn 't get this thing going and the volcano blows , we could all die right here . In light of that ... be good to each other . - Yep . - Yes , ma 'am . Please . Great . Yeah . But looking at your face , I 'm gonna guess that , uh , you were just talking to Dana ? You knew about him ? Yeah , since the Alamo . And you didn 't tell me ? I thought it was kind of obvious . He 's a good guy . A good guy . Yeah , okay , he 's a good guy , uh-huh . He 'll be great for her . Love it . Love it . - We have to pick up our talk . - No , we don 't . - It 's not good enough ... - What ? For some of us to live through this . Unless we all survive , then everything is for nothing . Well , the number-one rule of survival is don 't die , make the other person die . There are different kinds of death . Really ? Name two . What if we make it through all this , but the price of it is that we die spiritually ? That 's what we 're risking when we kill these people . Josh , I get us through things . That 's what I do . That 's my job . I 'm not mystical . That spiritual stuff , I really don 't understand . We got to go ! We got to go ! It 's okay . The engine is still cooling . It 's all right . - The mountain 's blowing steam . - No , it 's fine . Until there 's tremors , we 're all safe . Honey ... I just don 't want to ride with Dana . Like , I get that they should be happy and everything . It 's just , like ... too much . Yeah , I know . Who is that ? That 's my boy . - Ah , he 's cute . - Aww , that 's sweet . He passed away about a year ago , before all this started . - Jane , I 'm so sorry . - We didn 't know . I 'm so sorry . He was supposed to be getting better , so I took a deployment . And then he didn 't . And I never got a chance to say good-bye . Where 's his dad ? Where 's anyone anymore ? I 'm sorry . Jane , I 'm sorry . Look , I 'm telling you this because you lost someone yesterday , and if I were you , I would deal with it . And I never did . Since when do you care about Moon Dog ? We 'll live or die based on which way the volcano erupts . And he might know . Paperweights these days , and I tell ' em straight , I tell ' em all both less and great , it is the beast from the East where the boat of Ra pulls out from every morning , oh , my chicks and Chicklets . 70 miles of death in 3 directions , 10 to 20 to the west . So let 's remember that Greely lie . Go west , young man , 'cause you go East , and you will die . - Shit . - What ? - We 're going east . - Turn around . Go west . We can 't . We can 't do that . We 'll just head back into the volcano . - Okay , north or south . - There 's no other roads . Remind us that life is one sweet kiss and then turn off the bliss . This next load goes to all those chrome-dome strangers on the road , looking for a place to lay their hats tonight . Godspeed , all travelers . You 're right . There 's no roads north or south . Let me see . - Dad , look out ! - Aah ! - What the hell ? - For God 's sake . Oh , did you see that ? Where 'd he go ? Wait , Matt . Okay . Okay . Room for one more ? Why don 't you back up first ? Who are you ? I 've only just arrived . What 's your name ? Monk . Where are your shoes ? Where they belong , of course ... Away from my feet . Razor , Book of Mormon , tea leaves . There 's no weapon . Well , I 'm from Tibet . This body is my new vessel . My monastery vanished in the blink of an eye . When ? I don 't know . I entered the void , where there is no time . I woke up here ... in this vessel . Sniper ! Get down ! Take cover behind the truck ! Martin ! Get in ! Get in ! Take cover , honey ! Martin , do you have eyes ? Somewhere in those rocks ! Ugh . Is this you ? Huh , buddy ? - You setting us up ? - I 'm by myself . You better get cover . I have nothing to protect . Dad 's been hit ! - Dad ! - Stay here ! Honey ! Honey ! God , stay down . Stay down . Stay down . Put pressure . Put your head down . Put your head down . Get down ! He 's gonna see you ! I 'm the one who sees . Did you just kill that guy ? Dad ! Get him up . Get him up . - Be careful . - Careful , careful . - Be gentle . Be gentle . - Okay , come on . - Okay , okay . - Careful . The freaking truck is dead ... Shot through the radiator . We have many things to discuss . Dad is not gonna die , so stop it . Stop thinking about it . Thinking about what ? Dana ... he 's not gonna die , all right ? That 's not what I was thinking about . You know why Mom made you ride with me , right ? So that I 'd stop thinking about Devyn . And you being like this is not helping me . Well , because I 'm scared . What if he dies ? He 's not gonna die , okay ? He 's ... 'Cause he ... It 's not gonna happen . Well , that is some poor reasoning . Yeah , well , logic isn 't everything , okay ? Your twin voodoo or whatever told you that I wasn 't dead . I know Dad is not gonna die . It 's the same thing . Think of something else . I can 't . Dana , I swear . He is not gonna die . Is that your new mantra now ? I don 't know what a mantra is . - It 's just a phrase that ... - I don 't care what a mantra is . Would you drive with me , please ? It burns . Honey , we 're gonna have to take the round out , all right ? How bad is it ? How bad is it ? It 's enough that we 're gonna take the round out . Guys ... - Anesthesia ? - It 's local . - Let me do it . - What are you doing ? - Let him try . - Let me take care of it . Karen , Karen , let him try . Okay . Baby , I 'm here with you , okay ? The bullet missed your organs . Very lucky . Very lucky . Okay . Ohh ! Aah ! Ooh . What are you doing ? Stay with me , Josh . What the hell ? - Are you with me ? - Yeah . Dad , Dad , Dad , Dad . Come on . It 's all right . Oh , shit . It 's all right . It 's fine . It 's okay . It 's okay . And here 's your bullet . Will you take it , please ? Do you have a towel ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Here 's one . We have Chitosan to stop the bleeding . No , no , it 's not necessary . Can you get my bag , please ? I 'm gonna bandage him up , okay ? - Shh . - He 'll be fine . This is better than stitches . - What happened ? - No , no , he 's just ... He 's sleeping . We 're gonna let him rest . Tea leaves . Slightly , here so he heals up really well . See the color coming back to his face ? Let 's let him rest . Let 's just let him rest . I hope you don 't mind my saying this ... I 'm sure I will . I see that you care deeply for your family . - Obviously I do . - But you 're troubled by the number of people that you 've killed . I don 't know . You just killed somebody . Killing involves death . Death is an illusion . - Therefore ... - Therefore , bullshit . Killing is real . Huh , what is real ? Am I real ? - Apparently . - But you wish that I wasn 't . That 's not what I wish . I don 't know what I wish . I know that I regret the people that I 've killed . I can see that . It 's no mystery . - Okay . - All right ? To look at you is to know , it is to understand , it is to feel . It 'll be okay . Hey , uh ... Martin 's looking for you . Okay . Wow . You 're driving . Yeah , Mom made me . - How 's Dad ? - He 's asleep . He 'll be okay . You drive pretty well . Yeah , I know . I used to steal a lot of cars . Matt , I 'm scared . Good . You should be . You never stole cars . I was with people who stole cars . It was influential . What if he dies ? He won 't die . People die all the time now . It 's the end of the world . Well , yeah , but if you extrapolate that ... - It 's just statistically ... - Smaller word , please . Okay , if you take the situation and you project it into the future ... Oh . You mean " extrapolate . " You could have just said that . Yes . If you extrapolate the death rate around here , then we all die . I was in firefights in Afghanistan . You know who dies ? People who think they 're gonna die . I swear to God . Anyone who thought they were coming back ... came back . You think you 're gonna die anytime soon ? Honestly ? No . I don 't . Yeah . I don 't either . Whatever this thing is ... you and me , we 're gonna be there when it ends . We 're gonna know each other for the rest of our lives . Okay ... either I 'm getting the flu , or you 're giving me chills . It could be the flu . It 's not the flu . How long was I out ? A very brief time . You must be strong . - Where are we ? - Still in danger . Oh , what 's new ? We 're always in danger . Well , this danger is imminent . The volcano will erupt and none of us will survive . What should we do ? Mm , I 've passed through life many times . I find the best preparation is to sing your death song . Yeah , I don 't think we 're gonna be doing that . Something else , then , but we are out of time , and most certainly , we 're all going to die , so ... How do you know we 're gonna die ? Would you believe me if I told you ? - No . - Hmm . - But you have an idea ? - I do , yes . Go back to the volcano . Back to the volcano . That 's an awesome idea . Why didn 't I think of that ? There 's a prayer wheel on it , and I believe that that 's why this vessel brought me here . What 's a prayer wheel do ? It 's something that grants its possessor - anything they desire most . - Of course . So you could stop the volcano ? Mm ! Mm ... presumably . Oh , right . So you just want us to walk up an erupting volcano . - Do you really believe this ? - I 'm in the business of belief . Oh , so , if you could , say , do that , um , why don 't you just do it yourself ? Because I 'm not the one who needs to be saved . I can surf the wave , vessel to vessel , but ... you can 't . D-do we need to talk about this more ? I mean , you 're clearly ... completely insane . I 'm gonna ... Honey , can we just , like , drive as fast as we can and outrun this thing ? Oh , I regret to inform you , that will be impossible . The road is destroyed . - Of course it is . - Just ahead of us . Uh-huh . Mom ! Mom , come here a sec . Now ! What is it ? We 're out of road . What do we do ? Um , I 'm gonna talk to your dad . Uh , can I ... can I be alone with my husband ? Thanks . I think we should go outside . - Honey , you 've just been shot . - No , no , no . I 'm ... I 'm better . Oh , okay . Let 's go . - Hey . - Oh . Do you believe in miracles ? No . - I do . Karen , look ... - Yeah ? - Holy shit . - Yeah . Holy something . I don 't know . I don 't know . What do you want to do ? Believe in the guy ? Okay , let 's go back . - See the volcano . - When Mount Rainer blows , there 's gonna be a pyroclastic flow that 's 2,000 degrees and moving 500 miles an hour . Okay . There are avalanche shelters . You 're gonna go in ' em . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna go find the prayer wheel . No , I 'm ... I 'm gonna go find the prayer wheel . Oh , you 're gonna go find it ? You just got shot . - I 'm healed now . - No , Josh . - You don 't even believe in it . - You do , and that 's enough . I better get back . Mm-hmm . All right . Do you know how fast an eruption travels ? Um , 500 miles an hour ? Yeah , it 's like liquid cement that 's on fire . It 's gonna burn you alive . That 's why you 're giving me this , right ? Track me . How far up is this thing ? If there is even a thing . Uh , well , how do I know ? - The journey will not be long . - There you go . The prayer wheel should be somewhere near the base . What he said . Mom , we stick together . That 's what we do . We evaluate risk . That 's what we do . The smallest amount of risk is me going up there alone . You 're not going alone . I 'm coming with you . That 's not necessary . I have orders to protect you . I 'll make sure these guys don 't get into trouble while you 're gone . You better . - I love you , okay ? - Just come back . I will . We should wait here for you . Mom , come with us to the shelters . This is not good-bye . - Please . - I promise you . - All right . - Ready ? - I 'm ready . - Good . See you tonight . I 'm sorry . I don 't believe this . Who in the hell walks up an exploding mountain ? Someone who 's ready to die for their family . Nobody is dying . Nobody is dying . Got it ? Where are we ? We 're on track . I just saw a sign for the shelter . Which way ? - This way . - Okay . You okay ? No . - We have to keep moving . - Just go on without me . Danny bailed , too . How 'd that work out for him ? Danny didn 't bail , Steve . He fell off your hold . - We just left him there . - Shut up , all right ? He griped all the way up the mountain , then he lost his edge . Hey , don 't bogart the water ! Please . - Hey ! Oh ! - Hey ! Hey ! - Hey ! - Hey ! - What do we got ? - Two people . Pull over . Could be trouble . I don 't think so . Let 's stop . - Why chance it ? - Martin ! - Hey ! - Anna , look out ! Martin , stop for them . What are they doing ? Hey ! Come on , come on . - Hey , he listened to me . - Happy wife , happy life . You , uh , could 've killed us . Well , we didn 't . Nice way to start a conversation , pal . Whoa . He 's just stressed , okay ? Look , our friend fell into the crater , and we got caught in the steam , and we , um ... We just really need a ride . - Your friend fell ? - Yeah , he froze up . You let him go . He was gonna fall anyways . I chose to live . We 're headed to the avalanche shelters . You can join us . Uh , how you gonna do that ? There 's too many of us . So keep walking . No , with this many people , there 's only enough oxygen in the shelters for a few hours , at most . Yeah , the only way out is to keep driving . - Sorry . We can 't do that . - Our mother 's on the volcano . - For real ? - She 's dead . Shut up about that ! You can join us or not . The shelter is a mistake . - Let 's go . Come on , that 's it . - You got to keep driving . Start walking , pal . Uh ... Wait . Okay , okay , yes , we 'll take the ride , right ? Thank you . So you met a monk , and he said there was a way to stop Rainier from erupting ? - Yeah , yeah . - And you believe him ? Well , I got shot in the gut with a rifle just today , and he cured it , so ... How ? I don 't know that , but it 's gone . So you believe the eruption can be stopped , but you 're heading for a shelter because you think the volcano might erupt ? Technically , yes , I guess ... I suppose that 's true . That makes no sense . Well , you two were trying to climb up a volcano , and then your friend died . But we 're getting down alive , no matter what . What ? We 've reached our destination . - This is it ? - Yes . I thought it was gonna be smaller ... something I could hold or ... spin . Evidently not . Okay . So what do I do ? Step into the wheel , and ... oh , I assume the rest will follow . What if I 'm not pure ? You 're risking your life to protect your family . What could be more pure than this ? Step away , Karen . I 'm walking into that thing , not you . Look , I don 't like these two , but ... they could be right . What ? You believe them ? Why would they lie ? 'Cause they 're random strangers we should not have picked up . Well , my dad is usually right about things . Your dad is a fantastic guy , but the world is not set up for fantastic guys anymore . You can 't trust anyone . - You trust me . - Because I love you . These two are just arrogant clowns . They 're gonna do whatever they need , not what we need . Okay , but can you just roll the film back to ... to when you said that ... That I love you ? Yeah . Sure . But don 't you think it 's kind of a big word ? I don 't know . I mean ... Devyn died for your sister ... Literally died rather than hurt her , and he knew her for what , a week ? The end of the world is making everything mean more , Dana . You and me ... we don 't know how much time we 're gonna have , but my bet is we 're gonna spend all of it together . So we 're , like ... married , then ? Well , we 're something . Why don 't we just leave it at that ? Okay . But if we 're , like ... you know , weirdly married ... I would like to hold hands ... or something . Yeah , that can be arranged . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You 're gonna shoot me with my own gun ? I am walking into the wheel , not you ! No , you 're not . No , you 're not , and you 're wasting time . To do what ... Take evil from the world ? You can 't stop this shit . All you can do is grab on to whatever happiness you have left . And I want mine ! I want my son back ! - Okay , okay . - If you do this ... you will not find the results you seek . A girl 's got to dream . You want to be next ? No . Good . Here I go . Okay , here 's the shelter . Steve , hang on . Hey , hey , let me take that for you . All right , thanks . Yeah . All right ! Everyone stay still ! - Hey , hey , hey , hey ! - Let her go ! Put that thing down , now ! - Steve . - This is our thing now . Put the gun down . You go in there , you 're gonna die . It 's all the same to me . I 'll see you around . Don 't ! Don 't ! Don 't make me do this ! I just want my child back . Stop it ! I 'm getting my son . Jane ... Jane ... He lied to us ! Nothing 's happening . Why can 't I see my son ? What the hell ? What 's happening ? What the hell ? What the hell ? - I 'll kill her . - Oh , my God . I 'll kill her . You 're not strong enough to kill my sister , you dickhead ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Guys , no guns . No guns , no guns ! Your dad 's right . Everyone put them down ! Relax ! Put your gun on the ground now . Here we go . What are you planning , Steve ? Go get it . Go get it ! Steve ! What 's your plan ? Your plan is shit , man ! You guys go hide in those shelters if you want ! - We 're taking your vehicle ! - Your plan doesn 't work . You have no time to get down this mountain . I 'd rather die running than hiding . We 'll all make it in the shelters . We can still make it work . Oh , did the monk tell you that ? - Everyone , relax ! - Just give us the keys , okay ? Go and take the keys , you idiot . - Keys , all right . - Keys , please . Are you kidding me ? Anna , get back here ! I 'll go get them ! Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey . Just don 't ... Don 't worry about that . Take a breath . Okay , just put it down . Put the gun down . No . Don 't tell me what to do . Hey , you 're not killers . You 're climbers . Martin , stop . Just stop moving . Just let her go . You 're not gonna shoot anyone . - Just stop moving . - Just let her go . - Let her go . - Stop moving . You 're not gonna stab anyone in the throat . So ... So let 's just . Aah ! Martin ! - No ! - What did you do ? What the hell did you just do ? Aah ! No ! No ! What the ... Sorry ! I 'm so sorry ! Steve ... - Give me your belt . - What ? - Give me your belt ! - Okay , okay , okay . No ! - Let 's go ! - Okay , I 'm trying . - What are you doing ? - Come here . Please , what are you doing ? Please . Please don 't . What are you doing ? No ! Steve ... Please . Please don 't . Just don 't , please . I 'm sorry . - I 'm sorr ... - Come with me . - What ? Why ? - ' Cause I 'm gonna hang you . No ! No ! Aah ! No ! No ! Aah ! No ! Aah ! No ! No ! Steve ! Steve ! No ! No ! Aah ! Aah ! You don 't have to do this . You don 't have to do this ! Please ! Please ! Please . - Matt . - No , I 'm not listening to you ! I 'm gonna get justice one freakin ' time in this world ! I 'm so sorry . Matt ! Matt , if you kill her , her blood is on you ! Please ! Oh , please ! That 's not right ! Matt , that had nothing to do with you ! Aah ! Matt ! What do you want to do ... Forgive them ? No , I want justice . Get it ... Get it off my neck ! Get it off . Hey ! Hey ! On your knees . You touch that , and I 'll scalp you . What are you gonna do , tough guy , huh ... kill us ? No , I 'm not gonna kill you . I 'm not gonna wear your blood . The volcano 's gonna do it for me . But you 're not getting in the motor home , and you 're not getting in the shelter with us . You 're gonna die under ten feet of liquid burning rock . Get up . Get up ! She shot the guy ! I didn 't do anything ! Put an ice pick to my daughter 's head ! You gave a gun to a fool ! And that fool killed a good man , and that good man loved my daughter . Now go ! Go on ! Is that fair ? Yeah , that 's fair . Martin ! I don 't want to leave him here ! We won 't , little girl . - You can 't just leave us here ! - We 're human beings ! Just miss them . Leave them for the lava . Go ! Go , go ! Up , down , left , right ... It doesn 't matter where you go ! You 're gonna die in burning rock ! Mm-hmm . You 're alive ? How ? How ? How ? How are you alive ? How are you alive ? Things happen . I ... I failed . But your noble actions merit reward . Look at me . Come with me . Where ? To my next destination . Life can 't be sustained here any longer . You realize that . Will my family be there ? I don 't know . But every other delight will be yours ... Security , rest , fulfillment . I don 't give up on my family . Even if they 're going to die ? You don 't know that . And I 'm gonna find out for myself . That 's a beautiful choice . You really are coming along , you know that ? You really are an asshole , you know that ? Oh . I need more time . Dad , we have to go now ! Dana , Dana ... Come on , Dana , give me your hand . I don 't want to leave him here . I don 't want to just leave him here . - Dana , Dana ... - Come on , Dana . Come on , come on , get in ! Come on , come on , get in ! Get in ! Where 's Dana ? Where 's Dana ? Dad , you have to get in ! Dad , get in ! Dana !

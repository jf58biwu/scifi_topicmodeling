 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... I 'll take you to a place where you can be with people like us . You can learn about yourself , your gift . My name is Jiaying . I have chosen to be your guide . Forgot I was working with " The Cavalry . " Don 't ever call me that . I 've heard the stories ... what went down in Bahrain . Coulson : She went in , crossed off the enemy force . - Didn 't say how . - Did she lose anyone in there ? Herself . [ Water running ] [ Shower door opens , closes ] _ Mm , you 're up early . Hmm , hey , we got a family to make , and there 's only one way to do that . And I 'm dedicated to the cause . Hmm , so thoughtful . [ Chuckles ] Mm . When you get back , maybe you and I can take a trip . Hmm . Somewhere warm . Mm . Focus our efforts to expand . [ Chuckles ] He 's gonna be a hell-raiser . Uh , not in my house . My house has rules . Oh , so you plan on being exactly like your own mother ? Well ... With a few modifications , yes . [ Doorbell rings ] [ Sighs ] He 's always early . Stall him . Come on in ! It 's open ! - Andrew ? Good morning . - Mm . You really leave your front door unlocked ? Eh , got the best security system in the world . And you 're early . This is my time . Sorry . So , who you going after ? Am I about to get a new patient ? Don 't know yet . But yeah , maybe . Hey , no leaking operational secrets . Come on , Coulson . We 're gonna be late . I 'm early . Keep her safe out there . She 's supposed to keep me safe . [ Chuckling ] Yeah . Hey . You be careful . I will . And when I come back , we 've got work to do . Come on . I got to go . [ Chuckles ] [ Guns cocking ] O 'Brien , thanks for the tunes . Anytime . It 's one dull flight . This really gifted individual ... what do we know ? Not much yet . You know they 're retiring this fleet ? About time . [ Sighs ] S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s putting every dime into the triskelion . Well ... not all the dimes . Fury 's quietly started a new initiative . Instead of this catch-and-release with powered people , we form a team , take Earth 's mightiest to find out if they 're heroes . And you mention this because you want my help ? Well , I know you got the family-planning thing going on . I 'm staying in the field . Good , ' cause you 'd be great . And that way , we could keep working together . Mm-hmm . Uh , one mission at a time . Look alive . Agent Hart . We 've got her , Phil . Gather up ! Meet Eva Belyakov ... 35 , index candidate . Russian intelligence has been pursuing her . Agents Coulson and May have been brought in to advise and make the approach . Thank you . We believe miss Belyakov possesses enhanced strength . This is what happened when a Russian officer tried to stop her with his car . She fled Russia unharmed . Looks pretty strong to me , so it 's important we don 't spook her . Just a friendly chat to bring her in for evaluation . And if all goes really well , we 'd gain an asset before the Russians find her . The approach will be public . It 's not ideal , but we go in now , we lose our window . Local military 's not used to standing down . Welcome to Bahrain . Let 's hope Belyakov cooperates . And if she doesn 't ? Then I call in the Cavalry . _ * * * Shanghai quieted down . Agents will extract in two hours . Are we having any issues following Agent Fitz ? You tailed him ? He resigned . Fitz has a lot of ideas . We 're just making sure that he doesn 't get any crazy ones . Like seeking out Coulson ? We find answers where we can . Perhaps you can fill in a few of the blanks ... specifically about powered people . What about Project Deathlok ? How long has Coulson been running Mike Peterson ? The contact has been minimal . He wasn 't an active asset . Seems pretty active to me . Do you expect us to believe he 's not part of Theta Protocol ? You can at least tell us what you do know about it . Coulson doesn 't bore me with the details of every little operation . May , we know this is massive . We have evidence that Coulson has quietly been moving alarming amounts of resources and manpower all over the globe . The only thing we found linking all these activities is a code name Theta Protocol . There 's no more details he shared with you ? Any director of S.H.I.E.L.D. has secrets . We 're not talking a few black-bag operations . Take your entire current budget and match it with this one program . That 's why we want to open Fury 's toolbox ... for answers . And I 'm sure there 's a simple one . Let me take charge of my base ... and I 'll talk Coulson in peacefully . That 's great . But so we 're on the same page , all our Intel on Coulson . You know him best . Tell us ... are we right to worry ? I know Coulson 's not our enemy . Jiaying : I want to know where you 're from . Did you make friends there ? - Skye : At S.H.I.E.L.D. ? - Yeah . They 're like family . Or they were . Until you changed ? They sent agents after you . I don 't know what happened . I know I impaled a guy . Who shot at you . No . I lost control . Do you understand your gift ? I ... Make things shake ? [ Laughs ] Well , not really . Everything 's shaking already , vibrating at its own natural frequency . This stone , the wood in the trees ... I believe you can learn to sense those frequencies around you and resonate with them so that not everything is shaking , only what you choose . Sense a frequency . How do I do that ? [ Chuckles ] I don 't know . I 'm not the one with the gift . I just work here . You think I can hear the stone ? [ Sighs ] [ Inhales deeply ] [ Warbling ] [ Gasps ] Whoa . You 've got to be kidding me . - [ Chuckles ] - Can you hear it ? No , not the stone . The mountain . It 's the loudest thing here . [ Chuckles ] Well , now take that frequency and see if you can amplify it . The last time I did something like this , a lot of people got hurt . You can 't hurt the mountain , and you 're not gonna hurt me . Don 't be afraid . [ Rumbling ] [ Gasps ] [ Both chuckle ] I moved a mountain . Remember that feeling . It 's not something to be afraid of . _ [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Goats bleating ] Faisal Ahmed , may I introduce Agents Coulson and May . Faisal is with Bahrain National Security . Pleasure , sir . Your people have been tracking her ? Yes , we followed Miss Belyakov to a caf√© in this market . This is a very dangerous area . Black-market importers , thieves ... not a place for tourists . So she didn 't come for falafel . She could be meeting with anyone . Whatever she wants , it 's not good . Unless she leave with you , our military will take her . This is our window . Fury will have our asses if an index candidate ends up in government hands . Okay . We 'll make this work . [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Goat bleats ] Hello . May I ? My name is Phil Coulson , and I 'm here to help . My group specializes in helping people like you , who have gifts . [ Russian accent ] And why should I trust you ? Because I could take you somewhere safe . I know you 've been on the run , but S.H.I.E.L.D. can protect you . You 're not alone in all of this . Locals incoming . Gun . Blue shirt . Agent O 'Brien . Be sure they don 't interfer . Why don 't we go somewhere more secure ? Hey . Can I talk you for a minute ? No . I like it here . Coulson , we 're running out of time . These men can 't help you . Let 's talk somewhere calmer . What is it you 're looking for ? Pain . [ Screaming ] Take it easy . Drop your weapons now . Easy ! Step back ! Drop the damn gun . - [ Gasps ] - No ! Easy . Let her go . Just put the girl down . I 'll come with you . Let my men go . We can all walk away from this . Stand back ! Do not follow us ! [ Speaking native language ] [ Girl whimpers ] So , what happens next ? Eat like crazy , then rest up . This afternoon will be much harder . Than the avalanche ? Now I need to take care of something else . I 'm very proud of your work today . Lincoln : Wow . Training go that well or that badly ? I caused an avalanche . [ Chuckling ] Is that a good thing ? Yeah , it 's good . You know , it 's really impressive for Jiaying to take anyone under her wing . Yeah ? Yeah . I like her . I just ... I can 't ... what 's her role here ? Her role is in charge . So really , she must like you . What kind of contraband you got there ? I-I knew you 'd be training . Hey , Lincoln ? Yeah ? If she 's in charge , how often does she train people ? Since I 've been here , let me see ... Never . Saw the look on your face when we mentioned Mike Peterson . Tell me if I 'm wrong , but ... Coulson didn 't just keep the specifics of Theta Protocol from you . I get the feeling that until we said it , you 'd never heard it before . That gut punch that you felt today ... that 's how we felt for months . I swore to build S.H.I.E.L.D. back up the right way , and I don 't think Coulson 's a bad guy . But a secret as big as Theta Protocol ... I can 't ignore that . Whatever he 's doing , it needs to be out in the light of day . You 're worried that I don 't understand your choice . Well , sometimes that 's the price of doing the right thing . No one will understand , and it hurts like hell . [ Siren walls ] The warehouse connects directly to the market . Once they holed up inside , my men cut off both exits ... the alley and the market entrance . Coulson : It 's a rat 's nest in there . Coulson , we I.D. ' d Belyakov 's friends ... local militia street gang , basically . That 's their stronghold . Okay , I 'm gonna call Agent O 'Brien , see if they 'll negotiate . [ Ringing ] O 'Brien , is that you ? You okay ? O 'Brien : Leave us alone . Can you talk ? Are they making demands ? Put me on with Belyakov . O 'Brien : Just leave us alone . [ Click ] " Leave us alone " ? Is he trying to warn us away , or ... we tried it the nice way . It 's time for my team to do its job . - Let 's move out ! - Yes sir . I should go in . Let them do their thing . Now we find out what kind of monster we 're dealing with . - [ Hisses ] - [ Inhales sharply ] Easy . This will help . Unless you 're removing them , you 're not helping at all . Once your gifts have revealed themselves , we will train you how to use them . I don 't want to train . I want to leave . My only gift is to be the scary monster under the bed . You are not a monster . I can 't even look in the mirror . My days are a pain . Every night , I 'm assaulted by constant nightmares . You 'll get through this . Stay out of it , spark plug . Don 't get so wrapped up in your physical changes that you miss out on the gifts layered below . It 's a tough change . What do you know about changes ? Let her vent a little . [ Sighs ] I 've been through this . It 's hard , but I promise our care is the best thing for you right now . I 'm tired of being caged . I want to feel fresh air . We 'll discuss it later . He means well . You know , I might have something to help you sleep . Sleep is easy . It 's the relentless nightmares . I 'm always being hunted like an animal , tangled in thorns . Or I dream of Skye ... Skye and her father at dinner , champagne , a bouquet of daisies . [ Chuckles ] And she 's so ... happy . She got everything , and I got thorns . I know this seems impossible , but ... don 't give up on us yet . - Hart : In position . - Thermal 's showing minimal activity . - Alpha set up . - Man : Bravo , good to go . All teams , this is Alpha . Go for breach . Woman : Back entrance secure , moving upstairs . Contact ... southwest corner ! - Bravo , check in . - [ Gunfire ] Man # 2 : We 're taking hits downstairs ! We 've got civilians here . I see the little girl . She 's alive . Man # 3 : Friendly fire ! - Friendly fire ! - All agents , disengage . - Disengage . - Hart , come in . - [ Feedback ] - Bravo , come in . All operators , check in . What was that ? Were they taken out ? Did they take themselves out ? What about the little girl ? I don 't know , but I have to call it in . That building just swallowed 12 agents in a minute . We 're alone on this . Jiaying : Okay . I play a note you hold it . Okay . [ Glass ringing ] [ Glass ringing ] [ Chuckles ] [ Glasses ringing ] [ Ringing stops ] Your gift is quite destructive , but look at the music you can make . [ Sighs ] That was amazing . So what ? We 'll drink from wooden cups at dinner . What 's wrong ? Nothing . That 's just it . Everything is great here . It feels like home , which ... Never ends well . Ends ? We 're not going anywhere . You sure ? ' Cause mistrust of home is my other superpower . Where is this coming from ? Nothing . It 's stupid . I broke a crystal decanter once at a foster family 's house , and now the glass , and ... they sent you back for that ? Well , I tried some of the scotch , too . But , yes , something bad happens every time I feel settled somewhere . I 'm 25 , and I have never spent more than two years anywhere . The second I made friends at the orphanage ... gone . And God forbid I called a foster family " home . " It 's " pack your bags . " I got the news on my birthday once , which is a complete farce , because I don 't even know when I was born . I 'm so sorry . S.H.I.E.L.D. was the closest I ever came to having a family . I belonged there , saw what I could be . Even that ended with agents hunting me through the woods . We 're not gonna turn on you or abandon you . This is a safe place . See , you say that , but I know you 're not being straight with me . Why do you care if I stay or go , and why are you trea ... July 2nd . [ Sighs ] You were born on July 2nd . It was , um , a hot night , and , for some reason , I decided to clean the house before I woke your father . Oh , my God . He said you didn 't age . Cal ... he , uh ... He ran over to the neighbor 's house to borrow their car but didn 't speak any Chinese . So , um ... It was a mess . It 's you . You 're my ... Deep down , I think you knew . [ Voice breaking ] I was too afraid to hope . [ Birds chirping ] Are you okay ? I wanted to run to you the second I saw you , wrap you in my arms . Why didn 't you ? Because you were forced into going through the mist . Joining our people had to be your choice . You deserved that . At St. Agnes , all the kids pray that their parents are out there , looking for them . You were . For years . After your father pieced me back together , we scoured the Earth . We were ruthless in hunting for you . One morning , I woke up , and I barely recognized myself . Your father was buried in the new , horrible man he had become . He couldn 't admit that our baby was gone . I thought I had to accept it . [ Voice breaking ] I 'm so sorry . [ Sniffles ] My sweet angel . I thought if I couldn 't find you , maybe I could help protect others , so I came here . I 'll make up for all of it . I swear . But listen . Right now , this has to be our secret . What do you mean , " secret " ? Why ? Our people have very strict rules , and they could perceive you as a threat . Simmons . Ah , May ! Mm . Thank God you 're back . Everybody keeps leaving . They weren 't too harsh on that awful ship ? No , they were very fair . In fact , they gave me command of the base . What does that mean ? It means that if our team makes contact , I answer the call . And it means we 've got work to do . Were you aware that you 've been working on Deathlok technology ? Oh , no , you 're mistaken . - That 's the design for a hybrid capacitor . - No . It 's Deathlok 's supercharged battery pack , and it may not be the only thing he kept from us . Did Coulson ever talk to you about a project named Theta Protocol ? May , I have no idea what that is . Is that why they took Coulson down ? Then what can I do ? We need to find out if they 're telling the truth . [ Sighs ] I 've been through a lot with Coulson . He doesn 't go off the reservation without a good reason . There are multiple hostages ... our whole damn tactical team . We need emergency backup 10 minutes ago . Tell them to send me in . I can fix the problem . I strongly advise sending our specialist inside ... Agent May . No . There are agents inside . - There 's no time to wait . - [ Sighs ] Yes , sir . Yes , sir . [ Beep ] Yay for red tape . They want us to wait . - For how long ? - The Bahrainis are pissed . I think they 're about two inches from bombing the building and calling it a night . If they go in , it 's gonna be an assault . People will die . I can do this . It 's all about slipping in and pulling them out . S.H.I.E.L.D. is not authorized for any action . [ Sirens wail in distance ] Go . [ Tires screech ] Oh , what are we saying this time ? Nuclear ? Bio ? Eh , bio always works . My name is Phil Coulson . I represent the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division , and you are about to enter a quarantine site . Colonel , you can 't send your men in there ! A biological weapon was set off ! Nasty stuff ... flesh-eating . Weapons sale gone bad with the Russians . Give my team time to assess . Did you say , " biological weapon " ? Yes , I did . [ Beep ] [ Cellphone ringing ] [ Beep ] Hon ? What 's wrong ? We 're going off book here ... hostage situation , our guys inside . You 're going in alone ? Babe . Drew , they have a little girl . Okay . [ Sighs ] You 've done this before . You always come home . Hey ... she 's gonna be scared . Take a knee . Get down to her level . It 'll help . If not , then just grab her and run like hell . Thanks . Do good , Melinda , but come home . - I love you . - Love you , too . [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Beep ] [ Grunting ] [ Bone cracks ] Coulson , you read ? - [ Feedback ] - Damn ! - [ Bone cracks ] - [ Grunts ] [ Door creaks ] Agent Hart . Hart , it 's Agent May . We need to go now . It 's dangerous out there . Are you okay ? No . I need your pain . [ Gun cocks ] [ Both grunt ] What the hell are you doing , sir ? We have to go . I need your pain . I need your pain . I need your pain . I need your pain . I need your pain . Belyakov is controlling you . Hart , that woman is controlling you . I want your pain . [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Gunshot ] [ Exhales sharply ] I 've got to take her out . If we keep digging ... [ sighs ] I 'm afraid of what we 're going to find . Coulson 's reported trips . Cross-referenced it with Bobbi 's Intel . Most were covers . If he said London , he was meeting in Milan or Belgrade , Cairo , buying God knows what . My findings aren 't much better . Evidence of construction . I can 't even count the shell companies . Coulson 's burning through money . Bobbi wasn 't lying , May . It 's a whole other life . And , um ... What is it ? Coulson met with your ex-husband . They 've been consulting for a while . Okay . Put it on the map . What 's Coulson even need with 100 bunk beds ? We think he 's building another base , for powered people . In my opinion , Coulson 's determined to explore people with powers . He 's been on the front lines of it his whole career ... avengers initiative , Tahiti . Everything he 's done since restarting S.H.I.E.L.D. Tells me he 's continuing the work . He wouldn 't why blow up the alien city ? Well , why go there at all ? We could debate all day . But if you 're planning on training superpowered people , you 're gonna need a lot of bunks and scientists and money . And you 're definitely gonna find a very good psychologist . Simmons , I need you to get me into Fury 's toolbox . Coulson could have good reason for keeping this quiet . Open the box . Best intentions aside , underestimating powers is playing with fire . [ Footsteps approaching ] Am I free to go ? Skye had a choice . Are you telling me I can 't leave ? No . I 'm telling you ... I can never leave . [ Book thuds ] I can take you to beautiful places ... pyramids by moonlight , an island untouched by man . But it is too dangerous in public right now . You don 't know that . I 'm a survivor . I know you are . And you 're too good to pity yourself . I know isolation , pain . Think this face didn 't take some getting used to ? You can teleport . That 's amazing . But first , I was blind , lost in the world . These gifts are deeply layered for people like us . Now I can go anywhere find our people . Well , what was the good in finding me ? If I have a use , I don 't know it . Yet . I will be your guide . Your beauty will be reflected in a wonderful gift . People like us have to live differently , but it doesn 't mean it can 't be an amazing world . As long as I have you to show it to me . - Ethan . - Hey . I hear you 're headed away . Uh , yeah . Taking some time to backpack . Gordon 's dropping me off in Prague , so ... - Well , have a good trip . - Thanks . There are good people here . He hasn 't been through the mist yet . You don 't want to tell them because you 're responsible for deciding what to do with me . It 's complicated . Come with me . I 'm responsible for everyone here . Favoritism undermines trust . Don 't you want to tell people ? I don 't get that luxury . My rules must be enforced . People have died when the process for selection and training has been ignored . But I already skipped that process . And I protected you from the swift response that usually brings . It 's happened before . There was a woman once . She didn 't trust my judgment ... so she stole a batch of terrigen crystals and fled ... got caught up with some criminals in Bahrain . Her name was Eva ... Russian , strong-willed like you . I will feel your pain . [ Grunts ] I feel all their pain . [ Groaning ] And I grow stronger . May . The C ... the Cavalry . I know this story . A-An agent went in and ... killed her ? I wish it had been that simple . Stay back , honey . I 'll get you out of here . It 's gonna be all right . I 've had their pain . Now give me yours . Come on . I 've got plenty to share . [ Grunts ] Jiaying : With so much strength , Eva was bound to be noticed out in the world . [ Both grunting ] Feel enough pain yet ? Let everyone go , and this can end . No . I want more . [ Screams ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] [ Groaning , breathing heavily ] She 's dead . Snap out of it . Girl : I like the pain . She didn 't steal the crystals for herself . She stole them for her daughter , Katya . I saw a darkness in the girl . I didn 't think she should go through the mist , but Eva wanted Katya to receive her birthright . [ Gasps ] She trusted her judgment over mine . [ Gasps ] You killed mother . And now there is so much pain . I like all their pain . I 'm scared . I want to leave . Please , take my hand . Jiaying : Katya was too young . She went insane . With one touch , she leeched off emotions like a parasite . No . Not them . Let them go . We can fix you . We can help . Just don 't . Take my hand . Give me your pain . I need a new mother . I 'll take your pain . Stop . Don 't ... just put your hand down and stop . Everything 's gonna be all right . [ Gunshot ] Go , go . Katya had to be stopped , but not by S.H.I.E.L.D. She was my responsibility . You made the rules . Now you 're afraid they 'll think you broke them for me . Our people know too well what a woman will do for her daughter . So ... we keep our secret . No one will ever know . [ Man sighs , groans ] Did you see that move ? How did she take out that many people ? I must have been knocked out . I-I can 't remember anything . Had to have been 30 guys . But got our whole team out . The cavalry went in after all . Hey , every agent who walked out of that building is alive because of you . [ Voice breaking ] The girl . I-I couldn 't save her . [ Breathing heavily ] I ... She didn 't understand . I tried . It 's all right . You have to let the girl go , Melinda . You did good . Let the girl go . [ Sobbing ] Okay . Okay . We 'll get through this . [ Paper thuds ] [ Papers shuffling ] _ Skye : Are you sure it 's the right thing ? If this is some weird lesson ... it 's not a lesson . This is personal ... - a debt I owe to your father . And if you trust me in this , I 'll be eternally grateful . He 's a monster . He was good once . Cal lost himself to a promise he made me out of love . Now he 's made good . That shouldn 't mean all is forgiven . No . But he never gave up on you . He deserves something for that . Just one dinner , then you never have to see him again . I 'll have him taken away from here . You promise ? Oh . I had wanted so badly to make everything perfect for tonight . And suddenly , it is . Uh [ Clears throat ] these are for you . I want to thank you both of you ... for giving me another shot . I know that my actions ... I learned who my mother was today , and she ... taught me things . I 've never had that before . That was possible because of you . That 's all I really wanted for you . Cal , uh , Skye doesn 't know when her birthday is . I do . July 2nd . It ... it was - a gorgeous summer night ... beautiful , big moon in the sky . 1988 . Huh ? Do you know , your mother ... she actually cleaned before she told me . You see , there was only one car in the village ... And we didn 't own it . [ Chuckles ] So I had to negotiate with the man . He didn 't speak English , and my Chinese was terrible . [ Both chuckle ] Wait . ' 88 ? Mm-hmm . I 'm 26 ? [ Chuckles ] [ Laughing ] That 's so messed up . [ Chuckles ] Uh , sorry . Uh , to ... 26 . Yes . Here 's to 26 . To 26 . Mmm . Anyway , once we figured out the car situation ... did I tell you it was the year of the dragon ? Raina : I dream of Skye and her father at dinner ... bouquet of daisies . [ Indistinct conversation ] And she 's so ... Happy . Then we had to get you to the hospital . Your mother was all fine and calm . - I , of course , was ... - It 's not a dream . [ indistinct conversations ] [ Sighs ] It 's been 20 minutes . Sure there 's no window in there ? All right . [ Sighs ] [ Knock on door ] Hey , buddy , you gonna be all day in there ? Just a minute ! Geez , let a man think in peace . [ Whirring , beeping ] Whoa . Uh ... [ Knocking on door ] [ Man speaking Spanish ] Fitz : Hunter ! How did you ring Coulson 's tablet ? Where ... are you watching Mexican football ? Where are you ? Uh , undisclosed secure location ? Fitz ? How did you open Fury 's toolbox ? Don 't worry . It 's safe . I stole it first . - You stole it ? - Yeah . Fitz , you 're amazing . Can we meet up ? [ Knocking on door ] Uh ... I 'm being followed . They won 't grab me . I think they 're hoping I 'll lead them to you first . The thing is , would it still be okay if I came and hung out with you ? Maybe you could show me how to shake a tail . Maybe you could start , like , now ? You in a bathroom ? With one of those electric hand dryers ? Oh , yes . [ Chuckles ] You 're gonna be okay , mate .

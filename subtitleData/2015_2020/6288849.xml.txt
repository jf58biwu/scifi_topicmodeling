 Male : What 's up ladies ? What 's up ladies ? I got beers ! Here you go . One for the lady . Thank you . One of the gentleman . I got an idea . How about some day time skinny dipping ? No way . Aww , come on babe . I 'm gonna swim to that buoy and back . And I make it , you gotta go skinny dipping with me . A little further . Ha , Ha ! yeah ! Told you he 's make it . Unbelievable . Well , do you want to strip down now or wait till he gets back ? Male # 1 : Whoo-hoo ! Male # 1 : All of it . - Yeah . - Now the bottom . I don 't think so . Polly ! Male # 1 : Polly ! Polly ! Male # 2 : Mark ! Get back onto the sand ! There 's a shark in the water ! Hey , what the hell is that ? Male # 1 : Get her out of the water ! Male # 1 : Get out ! Mark : She was just here and now she 's gone . Get out of the water . Hey - Male # 1 : MARK ! Male # 1 : Somebody . Female : Mark ! Polly ! Male # 1 : Oh my god . What is it ? Do you hear screaming ? Screaming ? No . I 'll go check it out though . Calling Dr. Thomas . Maggie , the new intern has arrived at the island research facility . I will go up to meet her and will drop by your office in 30 minutes . Actually lets make that 15 minutes . We 're heading up there now . Hello , you must be our new intern . Maggie Peterson , I presume ? And you must be Dr. Nelson . Please call me " Ted " . Come inside . Okay . Watch your step . Oh , that 's Dr. Leonard . He doesn 't do well around people . Especially if they 're new . But at any rate , welcome to Persephone . I 'm thrilled to be here . Where can I start first ? Testing Ph levels , or helping with today 's specimen acquisition ? Raring , to go , huh ? I knew we hired you for a reason . But you 've gotta crawl before you walk , so , let 's start you with orientation . Oh . Great . It 's not like pulling teeth , I promise . So you really signed up to work in this godforsaken bunker , huh ? An opportunity to study the Great Pacific Garbage patch up close and personal ? I 'd never pass that up . Besides , you get to do all the cool stuff here at Persephone . Deep-sea dives . Animal discovery . Save the ocean . Well most of the time , it 's just paperwork . Maggie : Oh . Dr. Nelson : But don 't worry . We 'll find you something exciting to do . Come on . Let 's store your gear and I 'll give you the full tour . Perfect . Absolutely perfect . Professor Thomas ? I 've got someone here that you may like to meet . Prof. Thomas : Oh ! You must be Maggie . Maggie : Professor . It 's such an honor to meet you . Please . All I do is study garbage . Oh , we 're about to go on the big tour . Would you like to join us ? Yeah ! I 'd love to . You know what , we have some visitors coming today . Calling Dr. Thomas . The Earth Pact has just docked ... Dr. Thomas : Actually , they 've just arrived . So , why don 't we all do the tour together . You 2 can come with me . Male : Hey Brad , wait up top with the bags while we go down into the facility . Earth Pacters ! Hello ! Welcome ! We 're so glad you could make it . It 's always nice when we can work with new , potential colleagues . I 'm professor Laura Thomas . And this is Dr. Ted Nelson , and we have our newest inter - Greg ? ! You 've gotta be kidding me ? Care to introduce us to your friend , Maggie ? Uh ... Sure . This is Greg . He 's a , um ... We us to date in college . Before I dropped out , that is . Naturally . I haven 't seen you in what ? 3 years ? Yeah . Something like that . You look great . Prof. Thomas : Now that we 're all acquainted , why don 't you follow me . Professor Thomas : So guys , currently we 're half a mile under the ocean . This underwater station is so special to everyone that works here . With 45 qualified research staff . Selected by the worlds leading marine biology university programs and special interest groups . We have 2 state of the art underwater docks , and 3 submarine vehicles capable of collecting samples from the ocean floor . And Procuring specimens of local marine wildlife . I 'd like to formally welcome you to the Persephone . It 's truly one of a kind research station . We built this station on an island right next to the Garbage patch , and it features a central crater right down into the ocean . There are a group of smaller islands scattered around the facility , used for above water operations . It 's the only research station that allows us to fully study oceanic , plant and avian life that could be impacted by the nearby pollution , as well as flora . We are so pleased that Earth Pact has agreed to send you all out here for the day , so you can collect all the information that you need . Yes . It 's something that we 've been pushing for a while . To get activist groups , like yourselves , involved and get that facts that you need . Yep ! We believe that science and activism can go hand in hand , and be a powerful force for change . Well , why don 't we get right down to the tour , shall we ? Dr. Nelson I 'm going to let you handle that . I 'm gonna head to the control room . Have fun . Okay Maggie , why don 't we take Greg and your friends and we start at the top floor ? And that why we get your tour done as well . Sounds great . So , uh , we 're with you ? Looks that way . Guys , this is my old friend , Maggie . Maggie , this is Ryan , this is Allison , and this is Omar . Maggie : Did you gain some weight ? Or something else . This place must have cost a fortune . Greg : I always expected I would see you again . Greg : I just didn 't think it was going to be here . Well , surprise , I guess . I mean , I always figured you 'd end up at a place like this , though . And ? Yeah . You were always talking about being a scientist . Trying to invent something to save the planet . Yeah . And you were always saying , " the only way to change things , was to get out there and fight " . I guess not much has changed there . Still . We both wanted the same thing , right ? Greg : A better world ? Sure . Just different ... methodologies . We still ended up in the same place . Maggie . Greg . Try to keep up , please . Dr. Nelson : In here we look very closely to how pollution is affecting the habitats surrounding the Garbage Patch . And what this means to the animal life native to those Eco-systems . Most organisms we across are normal . But we 've been seeing some anomalies appearing in some of the creatures . Every 4th or 5th specimen we pull out from the sea in this are manifests a mutation . We keep them all here to study . But enough of that and the facility . On to the people that make it all happen . Dr. Nelson : This is the Specimen room . That 's Betts and Sandoval over there , hard at work . This is where we study animal life native to the island and the waters both below and around the Garbage Patch . Check their pollution levels , look out for anomalies ? You got it . Allison : Whoa , check these out behind you . Ryan : Weird . Omar : That 's crazy . These are amazing . Did you guys notice anything interesting ? Yeah , they 're mutations . Really unique ones , from the looks of things . Dr. Nelson : That 's correct . Every fourth or fifth specimen we pull from the ocean in this area , manifest a mutation . We keep them all here to study . Maggie : That 's the grim truth of what pollution does . Well , one of the things , anyway . This is what happens when people can just toss their garbage wherever they want . For instance , take a look at this turtle specimen . Exhibits the duel cranium abnormality . Wow . Far out . Check out this little guy . Geez . Real nice place you guys have here . Maggie : I don 't know what 's going on or what 's happening ? Dr. Nelson : Something 's riling them up . What could be causing this ? This sort of behaviors is normally triggered by the presence of a large predator . But this is a bit extreme , obviously . Excuse me . Dr. Thomas : Hey Steve ! How 's it looking ? The pollution levels at the Patch are looking pretty elevated today , Dr. Thomas : Huh . Steve : ... other than that , everything seems fine . How are the new kids ? They 're wonderful . Sorry . I need to take this . - Okay . Steve here . Dr. Nelson : Hey Steve , this is Ted . We 're down here in the specimen room . Something 's riling these creatures pretty badly . Can you see if there 's any seismic activity happening ? Any sort of weather anomaly ? Steve : I 'll give 'er a look . Give me two minutes . Okay , thanks . - What 's up ? That was the specimen room , something 's spooking the mutations . Just checking the tectonic plates activity , or maybe ... That 's weird . What do you have ? Something big . Right off the shoreline . Could it be a piece of the Garbage Patch that broke off ? Maybe something from the current that 's coming up ? Steve : Nothing this big would move so fast . Steve : I don 't know what the hell this is . It looks like it 's heading to the surface . I 'm gonna go topside and check it out , okay ? Oh hey , Steve , enable low alert , just in case . Okay . No way ! Is that - is that a whale ? All right ! Professor ! Something up ? I don 't know . Something topside . Ted come with me . You guys , stay here . I mean , it seems like that 's where all the action is . That 's what I 'm talking about . Let 's go . Ah , dammit ! Brad ! Hey ! Brad ! Get out of the water ! Male : Brad ! Did you ditch us ? What ? No man . I just left something on the boat . Oh you guys just missed it though . There was a big whale or something out here , a minute ago . Brad ! Get out of the water , now ! Nah , it 's fine Professor . We 've all kicked it with whales before . Are you serious , Brad ? Oh , hell yeah ! Here it comes again . You guys gotta see the size of this thing . What was that ? I have no idea . Everybody , get back inside . Brad , stop being an idiot and get out of the water . I don 't think that 's a whale . Oh ! Brad ! Maggie : Professor . Dr. Thomas : We need to enable higher safety protocols , now ! Maggie : Everybody , inside , now ! Greg , come on ! This is Brian . Brian , I need you to lock up down there . Right . Okay . I 'll do the best I can . Come on . We 've initiated stage one safety protocol . We need to move on to stage 2 . Someone just died . Attention Persephone . We are now moving to Stage 2 safety protocol . Complete lock down . Steve : Attention Coast Guard , this is Persephone Research Station 1 . Requesting assistance immediately . Over . Coast Guard , this is Persephone . Requesting immediate assistance . Over . Mayday ! Mayday ! Coast Guard ? Anyone ? Do you copy ? Something 's jamming the signal . Elevated radiation levels from the garbage patch . Steve : They play hell with the radio signal from time to time . Not great timing , Steve . Yeah . Tell me about it . Right . Um ... So now what ? We just wait it out ? We have ruptures in the hull . We 're taking on water in some places on main level 2 . But it looks like we 're working on getting those sealed off . Okay . Stay on high alert . All of you . Follow our safety - Professor . Professor , LOOK ! It 's building speed . This doesn 't make sense . Sharks are hunters , but this level of aggression ? It 's unheard of . Well , I 've never heard of a giant 3 headed shark before , either . But , I guess all bets are off at this point . We got to seal this section off before we take on too much water ! Come on ! Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! Give me that radio . ... overload . Full evacuation protocol initiated . Holy Hell . We need to evacuate , now ! Everyone try to remain calm . Follow me . Remain calm ? Come on ! Dr. Nelson , get these kids up top . Move ! Go , go , go ! Level 2-B , I got you taking on water . Steve , A-4 is taking on water . Way too much water . Brian : We 're evacuating down here . I 'm going to try to seal it off . You 've gotta get out of there , Brian . Get out ! Get out now , Brian ! Brian : There 's no way out . We - Level C ? Anyone copy on level C ? I 've got fires all over down there . Come in . - Drive ! - Yeah ! Ryan ! Let 's go , Ryan ! Let 's go ! Greg : Get on the horn . Look how fast that damn thing is . I don 't know if we can out run it . I guess we 'll find out . - I think the radio 's working . - Go , go , now ! Mayday ! Coast Guard ? Anyone there ? Mayday ! Coast Guard ? Is that you ? Ryan : Mayday ! Coast Guard ? Does anyone read me ? Ryan : Mayday ! Coast Guard ? Is anyone there ? Ryan : Mayday ! Coast Guard ? Anybody ? Help ! Ryan : Mayday ! Coast Guard ? Coast Guard , please ? This is Max Burns . You 're on the wrong frequency . Burns : You 've reach a fishing boat . Ryan : It doesn 't matter . We need help from someone . Anybody . We 're coming from the Persephone Research Station , near the Garbage Patch . Ryan : The station 's gone . A lot of people are dead . Can you help us ? Whoa , whoa , slow down . What do you mean , " attacked ? " Over . My name is Ryan Bennett . I 'm hailing you from the Transport vessel , Ps-001 . Ryan : The station was attacked by a giant ... 3 headed shark . Ryan : Destroyed the station . Killed almost everyone . This better not be a joke . Over . Ryan : Listen , man , I know how it sounds . But it 's a giant 3 headed shark . It attacked the station . It killed almost everybody . Burns : A 3 headed shark ? What have you been smoking , kid ? I don 't know what you think you saw , but - My friends are dead , man . Dead . You got to send someone , now . Ships . The Navy . I don 't care . Get somebody out here . 'Cause that thing is right on top of us ! Wait , wait , wait ! Where is it ? It broke off . Ryan : Over there ! Oh no . It 's heading right for that boat . Captain : Ha , these damn kids get some crazy on these things . Crazy . Hey . There you go , sailors . Thank you , Tori . Come on , Mrs. Grant . You know your money 's no good here . I told you to call me Rosemarie . " Mrs. Grant " makes me sound like my mother . Okay , Rosemarie . Thanks . You gotta listen to us . That thing is headed for another boat . Some kind of booze cruise . A lot of passengers . You gotta come now because ... they 're all in danger . If you 're making this up , kid , it 's your ass . Well , we 're on our way . Let 's go . Ship in distress . - Let 's go . I think I know what 's going on . What is it ? It 's being drawn towards the pollution of the larger vessel . What does that mean ? It 's making it insane . If it destroyed that island and the research station , that yacht doesn 't stand a chance , does it ? I 'm afraid not . We have to do something , you guys . We have to stop it . Stop it ? Stop it with what ? We don 't have anything but our wet clothes . We have to at least try to warn that boat , if nothing else . We can 't let it happen again . Not after we just watched all our friends die . Greg : She 's right . We have to try to warn them . Well , you 've lost your mind . Greg : No . They 're the ones thinking with clear heads . We just watched all our friends get eaten by that monster . All of them . You guys want to save our own asses , while we let innocent people die ? What if we can save them ? All right . All right . Greg : Here we go . That 's odd . Whale , maybe ? The tour company didn 't say anything about whale season . Ryan : Hey Burns . Burns ? It 's Ryan again . We 're headed right for the boat . We 're going to try to warn them but , we can use your help as soon as you can get here . Over . Earth Pact . On our way . Hang tough . That is really good news . Just come as fast as you can , okay ? Snorkeler : A big shadow moved past me under the water . Did you guys see anything from up there ? Female : What was that ? Co-captain : It hit us pretty hard . We 're taking on water . Captain : Yeah , we 've lost power on the port side engine . You round out and check the engine room , alert the crew , I 'm gonna call this in . Yes , sir . Mayday , mayday , mayday . We 're going down . Need assistance immediately . Oh my god ! Hold on . Hold on . - Howard . Hey , if I can have everyone 's attention , please . We 're going to pull anchor here in just a couple minutes . The Coast Guard is on their way . Captain , help us ! Where are the life rafts ? ! Captain : I 'm sorry . Male : We need to get off this boat ! Just tell us where they are ? ! Captain : I 'm sorry , we don 't have anything . Female : What ? No life rafts ? ! Are you kidding me ? ! Howard . I got you ! Give me your hand . Rosemarie , give me your hand . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Easy . I got you . Thank you so much . Thank you . It 's all good . Don 't mention it . - Oh . - Oh shoot . Now what ? We 're a sitting duck down here . This heap 's on its last legs . From the looks of this thing , isn 't doing any better than we are . We 're gonna do what we came here to do . Try to help . Let 's take that ladder all the way up . Come on you guys . Let 's go . Rosemarie : Howard ! Where did you guys come from ? We-we were at a nearby research station . That shark attacked us , wrecked the whole place . We saw it coming this way and tried to warn you guys , but ... You were too late . Rosemarie : My fiancé , Howard . - Relax . We have to rescue Howard . Where is Howard ? On the other side of this door . It 's locked . We don 't have a lot of time , you guys . What about life boats ? There no life boats . Ryan : Your kidding me . Maggie : Oh my god . Greg , how many people can fit on the Earth Pact boat ? Maybe 12 . I don 't know , the engine 's on it 's last legs . You know , any extra weigh - Howard ! Fine , I 'll go get him . - I 'm going with you . Fine , let 's just be quick about it . Greg , you stay here . Make sure everyone stays safe . Be careful . Hey man , let me see that . I 'm coming too . Step aside . Maggie : Its okay . Its okay . I 'm sorry . How 's it looking ? Not great . It 's got maybe 20 miles , if we 're lucky . You 're heading north ? Yeah . And we 're east of Persephone ? Yeah . I see it on the left , why ? Head north . North-west , now ! And keep it floored . Are you sure ? On the way to the Persephone , I passed a small atoll . Looked like a party pier type of place . Should be 10 , 15 miles out . Do you think we 'll be safe there ? I think it 's the only land that we can reach . Right now , it 's the only thing we have . Hold on . Engine 's looking rough , man . Yeah , yeah . I know . Just got keep driving till it gives out . Yeah , that 's usually my strategy . Hey ! Heads up ! That thing 's coming back guys . Doesn 't that thing ever give up ? Why should it ? It 's winning . There . There it is ! Think we 'll make it ? I 'm gonna do everything I possibly can . Hey , I think that 's Burn 's boat . Finally ! We 're almost there guys . Get ready . Keep it steady . You got it . Send that thing back to Hell , would you ? This is our only chance , you guys . We have to swim for it . Mother of God ! Damn ! Come on . On my mark ... Open fire . Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! Let him have it ! Unload ! Unload ! Where 'd it go ? I-I think we got ' em ! Ay ! In the name of God . Sir ? Are you okay ? Yeah . Is everybody here , all right ? Yeah . Okay as we 're gonna be , i guess . I 've never seen anything like that before in my life . Who 's is that ? Allison , come on ! Come on , Allison ! Hey ! Hey ! Male : Is he gone ? - Who are you ? Is he gone ? Hey ! How are you feeling ? I feel like I just got chased by a shark . - is he gone ? Stanley : Who are you ? - is he gone ? Is he gone ? Stanley : Who are you ? Hey ! Hey ! What happened here ? Stanley : Jesus . You mean they can come this far up the shore and do this kind of damage ? You 've seen exactly what It can do . That thing can get to us no matter where we are . They how the hell do we stop it ? The only things we got going for us right now are that , it can stay out of water for too long . And as Dr. Nelson tried to explain , it may need polluted water to survive . And it maybe attracted to to higher levels of pollution . Right . Stanley : There 's one more thing you know know . It grows more heads every time you cut one off . Like some damn hydra . That actually might be something we can us . How ? It 's getting angrier . More violent . You saw how each head was fighting the other , back there . Stanley : Can we use that against it ? How long have you been here ? So it 's not gone , is it ? The-the thing that killed everyone . The shark with all the heads . It 's not gone . Did you kill it ? It - It 's not good . We 're all gonna die . How-how did you guys get here ? Did you guys take a boat ? Did you guys get dropped off ? We came in boats . Flat boats . Like Pontoons ? Yeah . Pontoons . Whe - where the Pontoons ? They docked them on the other side of the island . Do you think they 're still here ? Are you kidding me ? ! I wasn 't going outside the cabana with that thing still in the water . I just hide . Stayed as quiet as I could . Till I heard voices . Where are the Pontoons ? Point them out . We can go , together . They 're on the other side of the island . Stanley : Where at ? Over there . Are you sure ? Pretty sure . All right guys , let 's go . All right you guys . We need to head out of here as fast as we can . You four , take that boat . Greg , Stanley , and I will take the boat back here . Allison , check the engine . - Got it . Guys get in . All right guys . If we 're gonna go , we better go . Let 's go . Allison ! It 's working ! Do you hear that ? Haul ass ! Don 't worry , you 're safe now . We 'll be back home in no time . Okay ? We 're gonna be okay . Rosemarie : No more sharks . Finally . Hey ! Maggie : Allison ! It 's behind you ! What are they trying to say ? Shark ! Look ! What 's wrong ? Maggie : Allison ! Shark ! Allison ! Guys ! The garbage . It 's been the pollution this whole time . It 's attracted to pollution . If we can somehow lead it back to the Garbage Patch , maybe we can kill it . Maggie : There will be so much to eat , it will go into a feeding frenzy . We 'll get it to eat itself alive . How fast can you get back there ? Hopefully fast enough . That party is what , 10 , 15 miles from the patch ? - Yeah . We 're already halfway there . Hey guys ? Look at all this garbage . Should be able to eat it the whole way back . That 's perfect . Come on , Greg . Let 's drive . Go ! - Yeah . Hey ! It 's working ! You got it ! Keep going . - Go , go , go . Hurry , hurry , hurry ! We 're almost there ! It got ' em ! Maggie ! Go , go , go ! Maggie : Stanley ! Stanley ! Relax . Relax . Sorry . It ate the last bag . - It 's okay . We ran out of garbage . It 's okay . Don 't worry about it . He ate the last one . I think we lost him . Don 't worry , We 'll get him ! Hold it tight , keep the pressure on . Hey , he 's still a shark , right ? Yeah . Sit . Stanley , relax ! Fueled by garbage and pollution , right ? - Yes . Stanley , what are you doing ? I 'm not gonna make it anyway . What ? Stanley ! No ! No , no , no , no ! Stanley ! No ! Wait , wait , wait ! What are you doing ? I 'm gonna go save him ! - Maggie , No ! Listen ! Remember you told me that I was always a fighter ? You 've done enough today . It 's my turn . Greg : I 'll get him back ! Stanley : Get back in the boat ! I got this ! Greg : Stanley ! get back here ! Maggie : Stanley ! Come back ! Greg : It 's too dangerous ! Stanley : I think it 's working . Maggie : Turn back now ! Stanley : The shark is starting to follow . Greg : Don 't do this ! Stanley : Take care of Maggie . Greg ! Greg : Stanley ! Stanley . Oh my god . Greg : The shark ! Oh , damn ! Greg ! Hurry ! Come back ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Swim ! Swim ! Swim ! Maggie : Greg ! Swim ! Hurry ! Hurry up ! Swim ! Maggie : Greg ! Now 's your chance . Get back onto the boat ! It 's working ! It 's working ! Oh ! - You did it ! Maggie : You did it . Sit down . We did it . Get your feet out the water . Out the water .

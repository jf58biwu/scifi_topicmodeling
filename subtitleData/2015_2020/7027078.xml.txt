 JAMIE : A decade ago , the animal population mutated , endangering human life on the planet . A group of us managed to cure the animals ... An animal expert , a veterinary pathologist , an Army Ranger , a doctor , a mercenary , and me , an investigative journalist . But a secretive group called The Shepherds released a gas that sterilized all of humanity . Our lead scientist was killed trying to stop them , so our team disbanded . Ten years later , his daughter has returned , believing he may still be alive . With the world trying to solve the sterility problem , a new threat has emerged ... The hybrids ... Lab-made creatures that threatened the West Coast . A massive barrier was constructed to protect the rest of North America . So we battle on many fronts , some of us searching for a cure to sterility , while others try to save as many lives as possible in the hybrid zone . [ dogs barking ] [ wind whistling ] We 're good . Send them . TESSA : Roger , roger . Sending the penguins to the igloo . Penguins ? Really ? Just trying to keep it spicy , babe . You know , I 'm pretty sure that penguins don 't live in igloos . Wrong . I 've seen it . Where 's that , now , at a zoo ? Maybe . Hey , we 're almost there , little man . Are you excited ? I want to go home . Yeah , I hear that , but , uh , I 'm afraid that 's not an option right now , okay ? But we 're gonna find you and your family a new home . Somewhere safe , somewhere beyond the barrier . You know , Michigan , Tennessee , who knows ? Maybe even all the way to New York , huh ? [ growling ] [ snarling ] - MAN : They 're back ! - Whoa , whoa ! - [ high-pitched ringing ] - [ growling ] Pedro , Sampson , where 'd you guys run off to ? MAN : Hybrids , incoming !

ABRAHAM : Thanks for meeting us back here . It 's been so long . Seven years . CLEMENTINE : Not just since I 've seen you guys . Since I 've seen a baby . I used to be obsessed with them . I had , like , three dolls that I took everywhere . Kids still do that ? Companies even make dolls anymore ? Um , Isaac 's more of a dinosaur kid . [ dog barks ] - [ dog barking playfully ] - [ Isaac laughing ] You guys are good parents . Clementine , I 'm sorry I didn 't recognize you earlier . Once your grandfather gained custody , he didn 't want us to make contact with you . We tried , but ... he must have blamed us for what happened to your father . We worried maybe you did , too . And then , things just got so busy with med school . Isaac was all-consuming , and then everything with Jackson . I didn 't come here to dig up the past . All that matters now is finding my dad . You think Mitch is still alive ? - For now . - If he 's alive ... then why hasn 't he reached out to us ? And where 's he been hiding for ten years ? MITCH : Uh , James Buchanan , Lincoln , Grant ... Garfield . ♪ Back then ... ♪ Why do you know so much about the presidents ? You know that kid that nobody talks to , right ? Well , I was the kid that that kid didn 't talk to .

God , I 'm already ... halfway through the next one , but this one is due June 15 . [ phone chimes ] Sorry , I 'm expecting my editor . Not him . They want me put a butterfly on the cover .

Thanks to your clickity-click machine . I 've lost track of how many times your lions have saved our heinies . Yeah , so have I. [ creature roaring ] [ loud , guttural snarls ] What is that ? I have no idea . You don 't happen to have any more lions in your back pocket , do you ? I want you to get them out of here to the safe zone as fast as possible , okay ? What are you gonna do ?

[ rhino roaring ] [ rhino groans ] [ Tessa grunts ] Call me crazy , but I think the line about kicking the hornet 's nest also applies to stabbing angry , prehistoric-looking monsters . For years , all anyone has seen are razorbacks . And that is not a razorback . You don 't say . Nine years ago , the IADG said it would be impossible for them to migrate to the United States . Now , the West Coast is overrun and now this . You know , you 're pretty cute when you get fired up . JACKSON : They 're spreading way too fast . And if we don 't find a way to stop them ... the entire world is gonna wind up looking like Portland . And the IADG is sending an investigator . Why don 't you ask them what they 're doing to stop the hybrids ? [ sighs ] : Yeah . TESSA : That is , if you want to spend our whole night off talking to the fuzz . [ keypad beeps ] You 're right . They 're the experts . We 'll let them handle it . Them and Dr. Abraham Kenyatta . [ whispers ] : That 's what I 'm talking about . [ propellers whirring ] There he is . My God . - What is that ? - It looks like a stasis tank . That would explain how he survived the hybrid attack . But who saved him and why ? I don 't know . All I know is he 's being held in an abandoned research lab in Eastern Siberia . Has he been there this whole time ? Hard to say . ABRAHAM : Here , let me . What is all this ? Abe has a theory on how to reverse the effects of the TX-gas . Restart procreation . He 's trying to separate something in the , um , the NLRP2 protein . You 're doing that research here ? DARIELA : He was at U of M , Ann Arbor , one of their top researchers . But , um , he 's actually made great breakthroughs here . I 've made some advancements , not breakthroughs . Anyway , that 's irrelevant . These are the breakthroughs that matter now . So , this is the facility he 's being held in . It 's been abandoned for years , but this shows continuous electricity usage in the eastern wing . That must be where he is . How did you get all this ? She stole it from the IADG . ABRAHAM : Why would you not just tell them you are Mitch 's daughter ? I 'm sure they would welcome you on the mission . Safe behind the border wall . I 'm sure you think the IADG are heroes , but something seems off about this mission . We need to go ourselves without the IADG . DARIELA : Well , that 's gonna be tough . Your intel is incomplete . None of these have an entrance marked . That 's why I 'm here . I need your help and fast . The IADG is on their way to get my father right now . We have to get there first . MEYERS : It 's him . It 's Mitch Morgan . TECH : Look at his scars . The tank must 've regenerated his wounds . It 's incredible . All right , let 's just load him up . Get him out of here before we get company . We can 't . Our specs were wrong . What ? His life support 's being provided by the tank 's power source . No battery pack . We move it , he 'll die . We 'll have to pull him out first . Good evening , Ms. Campbell . Home ? No , Brian , not home . [ scanner beeps ] JAMIE : When you won the Landerson Award . RONALD : Landerson Prize . [ audio plays backwards ] RONALD : Prize . Rise .

[ audio plays backwards ] JAMIE : Want me to put a butterfly on the cover . RONALD : You should fight . JAMIE : You know , the-the orange one , - with the black ... - RONALD : Monarch . The last monarch will rise in June . RONALD : The last monarch will rise in June . MYERS : Tank 's got a regulated power supply that 's keeping it locked . We 'd have to disconnect the generator first , - then pry it open . - So stop talking and do it . It 'll be like pulling the plug on a patient who 's on life support . We 'd only have a few minutes to get him free . I 'm not sure we can do it . - Hey . - Well , there 's only one way to find out . No , wait . [ tank powering down ] [ monitor beeping rapidly ] - We need him out now ! - You heard the man . Drain that thing . [ drill whirring ] DALLAS : Break through it , damn it . What 's taking so long ?

RONALD : The last monarch will rise in June . [ phone rings ] POLICE OFFICER : Freeze ! NYPD . Hands where we can see them . [ phone beeps ] POLICE OFFICER 2 : Detective on site . Good evening , Ms. Campbell . Detective . Jamie 's not answering or calling me back . She still has the plane . It is the fastest way to Siberia . I thought you guys were a team . A lot can change in ten years . Especially people . What about Jackson ? Can he help us ? I 'm afraid our communication is strictly one-way . The son of Robert Oz has many enemies . I cannot expose him . [ centrifuge beeps ] CLEMENTINE : This protein you 're working on . NR ... NLRP2 . Do you really think it 'll help people have babies again ? I 'm hopeful . But I don 't know . - DARIELA : Check it out . - You found something ? Yep . And Jackson sent you this . Grab the map . I thought the layout looked familiar . I worked at a black site in Poland that shared the same structure . Which means this hangar is the entrance . If Mitch is being held in the eastern wing as your intel suggests , we need to enter through this hangar , find an unmarked set of stairs , and this corridor here should lead us right to Mitch . We need to make sure we enter the hangar on the north side here , where we have the best chance of evading any surveillance cameras . That 's how we get in . We have everything we need now . I 'll call Emma , see if she can stay with Isaac . If we don 't hear from Jamie , we 'll head to the airport and charter a plane . Is Isaac gonna be okay ? While you guys are gone ? He 's a tough kid . Does he know , you know , what you guys used to do ? Who you were ? Abe and me , we didn 't have the best childhoods . I think we just wanted to give our son a normal one . Kind of hard when you 're the last generation on Earth . But maybe Abe 's research will change all that . Thanks again , Dariela . I really couldn 't have done this without you guys . [ phone beeps ] Dariela . Hi , Jonah . Well , this is a ... this is a surprise . Does Abe know you 're calling ? No . But I have some research you need to see . JAMIE : You know , this is private property . And this is a warrant . We 've gotten reports of a break-in near Columbus Park . Stolen property . Suspect matches your description . Huh . The mayor might disagree . I was just at a party with him discussing the new renovations to the museum . Donated a wing . No big deal . [ indistinct chatter over radio ] Guys , I can take it from here . Yes , sir . I warned you , Jamie . You have to stop this . Well , I 'm not your girlfriend anymore , so what I do isn 't really your concern . It is when you 're breaking the law . The Shepherds created a gas that sterilized the planet . They created hybrid animals that murdered our friends . There 's no Shepherds left . Their leadership has all been arrested , and the rest have scattered . - They 're not a threat . - Yeah , thanks to me . But one of their leaders is still out there . The Falcon . And they are planning something big , something worse than we 've ever seen . So if bending the rules is what it takes to stop them , - sign me up . - Then you 're no better than them . The last Shepherd that you chased ended up dead , remember ? What are you gonna do , arrest me ? - If I have to . - Great . I 'm sure the NYPD would love to know they 're working with a criminal . Jamie . I care about you . I always have . I always will . But I can 't sit back and watch you fall into darkness . Not anymore I can 't . Do you know what I had to do to get that ? It 's over . Tell the NYPD whatever you want , but if I catch you again , I will bring you in . You 're bluffing . I 'm not . Don 't make me prove it . My name is Lieutenant Myers . Of the International Animal Defense Group . IADG . We know what a traumatic experience this has been for you , and we know that you 're eager to get back to your family and friends . We 're just running a few tests to make sure that you 're stable enough to travel . How does that sound ? Great . Okay , let 's begin . Do you know what year it is ? Do you know where you are ? That 's just warm saline . We need to raise your body temperature . Do you remember how you got here ? Are you not answering because you don 't know the answer , or because y-you don 't understand what I 'm saying ? All right . Um ... Hey , look . We 'll try something else . Tap your , your left hand ... [ touches hand ] For " yes , " and tap your right hand for " no . " It 's like this . Do you know what year it is ? Do you know where you are ? Do you know your name ? [ children laughing ] How you doing , buddy ? Good . Now . Good , good . Well , if you get lost , or you have any questions , just ask , okay ? That thing you used to control the lions . How does it work ? This ? [ clears throat ] Well , um ... want to know a secret ? This is just a toothpick holder . I control the lions with my mind . Yeah , right . [ laughs softly ] Yeah , yeah , you got me . I have some friends who are scientists , they developed it for me . It 's , uh , part radio , part computer , and really , I 'm not sure how it works . I 'm just glad it does . You know , maybe one of these days , I 'll let you try it . - Cool . - All right , I 'll catch you later . I got to do a thing . MAN : All perimeter details , contact . Update status . Here for the hybrid ? MAN : Update status . [ gate opening ] MAN : IADG coming through . The IADG has been looking for you for a long time . You were last seen on the island of Pangaea , ten years ago . We 're here to help you . But you have to trust us , okay ? The pen . You want the pen . Yeah , yeah . Here . That 's good , take your time . That 's good . It 's all right . It 's okay . It 's okay , take your time . [ exhales ] What-what is that ? What does that say ? What does that mean ?

[ Sighs ] Whoever it is that you think you found , it 's not your dad . I 'm sorry , but he 's gone . And you know that . Not according to the IADG . I have their files . I have proof . I can 't help you . Yes , you can . No , I can 't . Okay ? I can 't do this again . I went to Pangaea , Clem . I-I spent years chasing down every lead , hoping against hope that , that Mitch would still be out there and alive somewhere j-just waiting for us to find him , but you know what ? He never was . It 's real this time . I promise . And I know there 's a part of you that believes me , that never stopped believing . And if I 'm right , can you really risk not being there when we find him ? [ growling ] I 'm on my way . [ snarling ] [ rhino roaring ] [ truck banging ] I 'm sorry . [ snorts ] ABRAHAM : Going somewhere ? Abraham , I 'm sorry . You were going to sneak off without us . I don 't understand . You and Dariela have a home here . You have Isaac . He needs you more than I do . I can 't let you go alone . It 's too dangerous . You ... This isn 't up for discussion . You are not telling us everything , Clementine . The little girl I knew would never - pull a gun on ... - People change . Clementine !

Dr. Morgan , I 'm afraid this is gonna come as a shock to you , but there 's somebody here who 's been waiting to talk to you . I can 't believe you just let her go . It 's not like I had a choice . Look , we 'll just have to catch up with her . - What the ... ? - [ squishing ] What is that ? It 's a sample of the new hybrid Jackson sent me . But it was just a few drops of blood .

I 'm gonna sleep for eight straight hours . Would you settle for six ? I could be convinced to settle for six . [ lock buzzes ] [ indistinct chatter over radio ] Hey . I need to know what 's on that drive , ASAP . Somebody went through a lot of trouble to get that . TESSA : Who 's with the fancy coat ? Is that the IADG investigator ?

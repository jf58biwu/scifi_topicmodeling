 Our enemies will pay for what they have done to us . The annihilation of our people will not be left unpunished . For a thousand years we have been waiting , hiding , observing . But our time to strike is finally at hand , my apprentice . Now the Jedi are weak , blinded by arrogance and limited by compassion They choose to deny the true nature of the Force . That hate makes us powerful . Very soon you 'll be strong enough . And vengeance will be ours . But until then , our presence must be kept hidden . We cannot let them know what we are planning . You must protect our secret at all costs . Any intruder must be destroyed immediately I 'm getting closer to the source of the signal ... I can feel it . Very good . Wait ! I think there 's something else ... No ! It cannot be ... We shouldn 't have come here . We must inform the council ! There is no time . We 'll have to deal with it ourselves . Everyone focus ! Don 't let him get away ! Stay close to me . You have been beaten ! Surrender . There is no escape for you . We can 't defeat him , we have to retreat ! If we let him escape it could mean the end for all of us ! You have to trust me . Okay . Sith ... Your fighting style is a long forgotten art ... But I understand it now . - Let us leave ! We already lost too much ! - We can 't get him . Don 't be afraid , my young apprentice , I will protect you . Come ! Focus . I 'm sorry ... Run ! You have done well , my apprentice . The force is strong with you . I have led these Jedi here for you . And every kill has made you stronger ! No mercy , no compassion limits you ! You are truly powerful ... Darth Maul , your training is complete . This is the beginning of the end for all Jedi . Yes , my master .

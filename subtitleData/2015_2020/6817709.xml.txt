 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... - How do you create matter from nothing ? - No . - Pure carbon . - You have to put down the weapon . What did he do to us ? The blast must have altered our state somehow . Trapped between dimensions ? These boxes look empty , but they 're not . They harness energy from multiple dimensions . The people who constructed these boxes used a book . It 's too much for a human mind to bear . Perhaps I could read the book . I 'm building an inter-dimensional gateway with an android I 've created . Robbie ? Mack got a lead on his uncle ... possible location . Want to help settle my last score ? 4x08 - " The Laws of Inferno Dynamics " Out of my way . I need to see him . How many are there ? How many ? ! Eli . Eli , we got a problem . Cops , S.H.I.E.L.D. ... they 're everywhere , man . Keep them busy . That 's why I pay you . You guys been paid yet ? I haven 't been paid . You want us to go to war with S.H.I.E.L.D. ? I don 't know , man . You 're right . A hard day 's work deserves a hard day 's pay . Hope you take diamonds . They 're unrefined , but they 're priceless once properly cut . Speaking of which , you may have to cut the rest out of his lungs . If S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to see what I 'm creating I 'll show them . I 'll show them all . We 're live in downtown L.A. , where several city streets have been blocked off due to what authorities are calling a potential threat . The details are scarce , but when S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives on the scene , it suggests the threat may be an Inhuman one . Joining us on the phone right now is the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. himself , Jeffrey Mace . Director Mace , can you clear up some of the rumors about what 's happening here right now ? Of course , and thanks for taking my call . The situation is that there is an escaped fugitive on the loose , and S.H.I.E.L.D. is assisting LAPD with the hunt . Is the fugitive you 're referring to Quake ? There have been reports of seismic activity in the area . No , I can assure you the threat is not Quake , and it is not Inhuman . Then why the evacuation ? Why is S.H.I.E.L.D. involved ? You know , it 's still an active scene , so I 'm afraid I can 't comment . But , uh , once the situation resolves , we 'll hold a full press conference . Hey , thanks for your time . It 's like a circus out there . - And that picture of me on the banner ... - Agreed ... not your best side . I 'll schedule a reshoot for this week . Burrows . Give us the room . How many people do we think Morrow has in there ? A small army . Leftovers from a Chinatown gang and some ex-cons he recruited while he was in prison . - We need to move in . - Press is everywhere on this . We can 't afford to be seen working with Daisy or Reyes . He 's a vigilante killer . It 's a little more complicated than that , but yes . He 's also nearly unstoppable , and he 's on our side . - And what happens when he 's not ? - Then we deal with him . But right now , the reality is this ... Eli Morrow just wiped out an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. Tac Team with a few shards of carbon that he created out of thin air . And that 's just what we 've seen . What else is he capable of ? We need the big guns on this one , and Yo-Yo , Daisy , and Reyes are the biggest guns we have . What about the science team ? And I 'm talking about Aida , specifically . I mean , she did , after all , bring you and Agent Fitz back from ... well , wherever the hell you were . If a similar technology is in play , she could have a solve . What ? You disagree ? - I don 't , actually . - But ... ? All cards on the table ? Aida 's an android . She 's ... W-What did you just say ? - An android . - Had me fooled , too . But that 's ... Okay . I mean , forget about the fact that I was mildly attracted to her . That totally goes against the Sokovia Accords . Doesn 't anyone remember Ultron ? Was this Radcliffe 's doing ? Sir , we really don 't have much time . The point is , a good Director needs to know what assets he has at his disposal , and in this case , I think Aida could be an asset ... a risky one , but ... it 's your call . Agent May , go to Dr. Radcliffe 's lab and get Aida . I want her on this mission . We 'll dismantle her afterwards . What about my assault team ? You got the green light . But , Coulson ... keep Daisy out of sight . Bold move ... telling him about Aida . - It was a strategic play . - Felt like poking the bear ? More like feeding the bear . I 'm hoping if give him something , - maybe he 'll give me something . - Like Senator Nadeer . I want to know what his deal is with her . She hates Inhumans , hates S.H.I.E.L.D. , yet he sends Simmons off to examine a new Inhuman for her . - I don 't like it . - Tough , isn 't it ... not to be the keeper of all the secrets ? It 's not about that . I just want to know whose side he 's on . The only side he 's ever been on ... his own . You 're right . Mace is a political animal . There 's got to be something in it for him . Good luck figuring that out . Meanwhile , I 'll be playing chauffeur to a robot . Sorry . Didn 't think you 'd get stuck on a milk run to Radcliffe 's . - We 're gonna miss you in the field . - I 'll catch up . Can 't let you have all the fun . When this is over , it 's time ... we are cracking that bottle . You don 't have to twist my arm . I wouldn 't dare . You might whip my ass . Just finished a scan of the building . - I 'm uploading signatures now . - Copy that . Yo , I 'm not wearing a mask , man . It 's not a mask ... it 's a balaclava . Thought that was a dessert . What ? No , ma ... Never mind . Director just wants you to keep a low profile . There 's a lot of media out here . - I don 't answer to him . - No , you don 't . Guy you answer to is a lot more unforgiving . Yeah , well , you know a little something about that now , don 't you ? Well , hopefully , when all this is over , - he won 't be anybody 's boss anymore . - Amen to that , brother . - All good ? - Yeah . Robbie 's on his way to Daisy , and , uh , Yo-Yo 's already with her . Agent Simmons , the gang 's all here and in position . Copy that , Agent Coulson . Fitz , do we have thermals off the satellite ? Morrow 's men retreated inside a few minutes ago . - All of them ? - Yeah . Strange . Zephyr to Assault Team ... be aware that all Morrow 's men have pulled back . You need to be ready for anything . Shards of carbon out of thin air ... it 's not possible . You can 't create something out of nothing . - First law of thermodynamics . - Exactly . Even in the realm of quantum vacuum fluctuations , there are still laws . - So how 's he doing it ? - Maybe it 's magic . I do not like magic . Or clowns . Or clowns with knives ... in the dark . Reading another earthquake ... 1-4 . For the record , it wasn 't me . Yeah , well , all the same , Daisy , I 'd like to look at the new gauntlets after the mission ... check that they 're calibrated correctly . They are ... trust me . The effect on my bones is a tenth of what it was . - Here comes Burning Man . - Any life on your side ? No . You sure Eli 's in there ? Let 's find out . Assault Team , you have a go . Copy . Breaching now . Looks all clear to me ... which means it isn 't . I hear something ... water running . - Can you do a little recon up ahead ? - Well , that depends . If " recon " means " look around , " sure . Yo-Yo ! You like playin ' with fire , Eli ? Let 's play . Director ... Sir , i-if I may explain , I wasn 't trying to fool anyone . But you did . Aida fooled everyone . She 's quite amazing , Doctor ... totally lifelike . Well , the LMD program was designed to save lives ... the lives of ... of ... of agents in the field , - of the Director . - Oh , I understand the allure . An android like Aida could be used as a soldier , - a spy , a decoy . - Or a chef , if you like . Sir ... I realize how this must look . Genius scientist with a questionable past forgetting to ask for the proper clearances , et cetera , et cetera . But I assure you ... all of my data is yours . - I 'm an open book . - Mm . Book . Right . That Arch-gateway thing that saved the team on their last mission ... Aida designed and built it , yes ? Which proves how valuable she can be . Mm . Is this what showed her how to build it ? The book ... helped , yes . I want to know more about it . Well , all I know is it 's a very powerful piece of technology . It 's like a ... like a tablet that can read your mind ... very intimidating , frankly , which is why we had Aida read it . It 's a good job we did . Otherwise , Agents Coulson and Fitz would have been lost in the dimensional vacuum of space-time . So the book intimidates you , but Aida doesn 't intimidate you ? No , not at all . Why ? What are your plans for her ? - Well , that depends . - On ? Her next mission . We need to get you up to the Zephyr so Simmons can check you out . I 'm fine . We have a job to do . Thanks . I 'm just trying to help you out . Why you being so cold ? I 'm not being cold . I just got hit by a giant fireball , I lost my favorite jacket , and you 're treating me like a ni√±a . Give me that . - You okay ? - Better than them , apparently . - Anything on Robbie ? - No . His camera 's all glitchy . The feed keeps cutting in and out . Going through the fire probably didn 't help . - Oh . - Hang on . We got something . Is this thing on ? Anyone seeing this ? We do . What the ... ? Looks like the power cells from Momentum Lab , except economy-sized . Morrow has created a giant battery for himself , filled with quantum energy . Well , not " created , " exactly . - No , no , no ! Don 't go in there ! - Robbie ? The comms must be fried . What the hell is that ? - What 's that object on the wall ? - Hope it 's not cesium again . Cesium ? Is that what ignited the entry hall ? Based on the spectral analysis of Yo-Yo 's jacket , yeah . It 's highly unstable . And pyrophoric , yeah . Reacts on contact with water . First carbon , now cesium ... it 's like Morrow is testing his abilities , making his way through the periodic table . Who knows what other traps he 's set ? I do . I 've seen that setup before . Don 't touch that . - Oh . - Eli . You don 't belong here , Robbie . Go home . - Please . - I will ... once you 're dead . - What the hell just happened ? - Robbie 's down . - I 'm going in . - Daisy , wait . You realize we 're trying to hide you from the press , right ? " A " ... I don 't care . " B " ... that wasn 't me . Um , guys , the problem is bigger than you think . There 's something in that building everyone needs to see . The " demon core ? " Seriously ? - You cannot make this stuff up . - I didn 't name it that . The physicists at Los Alamos did . This is the last image before Robbie 's feed cut out . They do look awfully similar ... whatever they are . - It 's a fail-safe . - It 's a fuel source . Well , it 's both ... powering not just the cell , but Eli himself . But it 's also the perfect insurance policy to keep us all at bay . Now ... Now , when you say " fail-safe " ... See this beryllium lid ? It 's a neutron reflector rigged to drop at the touch of a finger . If that lid drops into place , - it would trigger supercritical mass . - Time-out . Fail-safe , supercritical mass ... are you guys talking about what I think you 're talking about ? Eli 's made his way through the periodic table , - all the way to plutonium . - Alright . And if Matchstick messes with it ? Time for Plan " B. " Anyone ? Feel free to chime in . Guess I 'm not the only one with a secret . Between the radioactive plutonium and the quantum energy fields bombarding you and the carbon spike ... a normal person would have been dead 10 times over , but ... I guess you 're not normal , are you ? Come closer . I 'll show you what I am . I heard stories in prison ... whispers of a demon , " Ghost Rider . " My own nephew ? - How ? - It was ' cause of you . The night of the drive-by ... they were trying to kill you ... for things you 've done ! No , it was the Bauers ... Joe and Lucy . They started this ! They lied . You think I give a rat 's ass about any of that ? A bunch of scientists fighting over some stupid book ? All the killing , the bodies , the lives destroyed . I never meant for any of this to happen , Robbie . I never wanted to hurt you . We trusted you , T√©o ... Gabe and me . We loved you like a father ... - and you tore it all apart . - I know . Why ? Why 'd you do it ... become a killer ? Well , I guess it runs in the family . You had a PhD . - You had us . You had a good job . - A good job ? Those gueros at Momentum thought they were doing me a favor . They looked at me like they were better , like they were smarter ! The condescension in their eyes ... They got what they deserved . - You had to get vengeance . - Not vengeance ... respect ! You have no idea how hard I worked every day of my life . To claw my way , just to get in that damn door . Sure , I made mistakes , like any kid . And I paid for them . But it didn 't matter . From high school to grad school , no one believed in me ! They thought I was cheating . They thought I wasn 't capable ! Shut me out . Well , guess what ... guess what I 'm capable of now . I can create a city out of nothing , or I can cover it in volcanic rock . Robbie ... I am becoming a god . You better be . Because the devil is coming for you . Remember ... I gave you a chance to leave . Whatever happens next ... is on you . Agent Coulson , I took the liberty of bringing Dr. Radcliffe up to speed . Yes , quantum cells , flaming skulls , androids ... - just another day at S.H.I.E.L.D. , huh ? - What 's all this ? Components from the transdimensional Arch and the neodymium core from an EMP generator . Aida thought they could be quite useful . - Aida thinks ? - Maybe about " electric sheep . " I take it that was a joke and does not require a response . Mnh-mnh . - Nice to see you made it . - Just following orders . We need all hands on deck on this one . Still , Director , you didn 't need to come all this way . And miss the opportunity of seeing a nuclear weapon up close ? Not a chance . - How close do you mean ? - I think it 's time the public sees the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in action . Walk with me , Phil . I 've got a plan . Absorption plates , frequency mounts , resonant processor units ... the results don 't lie . - They 're perfect . - They might be a little snug , but they 've got me close to full strength , so ... - thank you . - You 're welcome . Hey , the good news is , you 're definitely not responsible for the seismic activity in the area . - As I 've said ... repeatedly . - Yeah , but now it 's really true . Ah , the Arch . I take it Aida 's arrived ? Don 't look so excited , but yes . She 's here , along with Dr. Radcliffe and Director Mace . Oh , well , then , the day is officially saved . No love for your new Director ? - He 's a lying weasel . - We don 't trust him . Really ? What 'd he do ? All due respect , sir , that 's the most ridiculous idea I 've heard all day , and it 's been a long day . I understand your concern , but I 'll be right there in the mix . You want to send Yo-Yo back into that building to grab a hunk of plutonium , - an unstable , radioactive substance . - We 'd put her in a hazmat suit . Not sure they 're built for running . She 's in no condition to go back into the field . I 'm right here , and I can speak for myself . My condition is fine . You 're not fine . There 's got to be a better plan . It 's not your decision , Agent Mackenzie . We got to get that bomb out of Morrow 's possession . Sir , maybe you should stick to optics - and let someone else handle tactics . - Mack . Director ... can I talk to you for a minute ? Elena ... please , I 'm trying to protect you . So it 's " Elena " now , is it ? Where has that been for the past three months ? Come on . You know how I feel about you . Well , if you bothered to take the time , you would realize I have many gifts . But reading minds is not one of them . - So , where is this Inhuman being held ? - I have no idea . The Director literally made me put a bag over my head , - had me whisked away . - It 's kidnapping . And he lied to everyone about it . And if the Director 's involved with Senator Nadeer , there 's no telling what they 've got planned . It just doesn 't make any sense . Director Mace is an Inhuman , and all that senator does is spew hate about us . What 's wrong ? Uh ... I feel a quake coming . Is that even possible ? The gauntlets can absorb a wide range of infrasonic waves . Better to shield your bones from further damage . Impressive you can feel it all the way up here . The epicenter 's right where Eli set up shop . That can 't be a coincidence . Something he created in there is the cause , whether it 's the power cell or ... - No , he 's not " creating " anything . - Here we go again . There 's an order to things in this seemingly chaotic universe . There are laws , okay ? And one of those laws says that every speck of matter that makes up every animal , vegetable , mineral ... no matter how much it changes , it comes from somewhere , belongs somewhere . Its natural state ... its home . It 's kind of a lovely sentiment , even if it was completely unintentional . So , what 's the cause of the quake ? - Grand larceny . - You 're losing them , Jeffrey . Yeah , well , maybe if you backed me up once in a while , - I wouldn 't be . - I won 't back a bad plan . Or any plan that 's not yours or part of your agenda . - What agenda ? - Oh , come on , Phil . Make up your mind . You want to be Director or not ? 'Cause I 'm not some meat puppet who 's just gonna smile and roll over on command . No one 's asking you to roll over , but you do have a nice smile . You stepped down from this job , yet ever since I took over , you 've been running around on this plane , doing what you want , whenever you want ! You mean saving lives ... that kind of thing ? I mean using fugitives and killers to do your dirty work , building robots , keeping secrets from me ? ! You want to talk about secrets ? Fine . Let 's do it . Let 's start with the secret plan you cut with Senator Nadeer . - Who told you about that ? - A ghost . Did you know she has an Inhuman prisoner locked away , like some sort of lab experiment ? What 's that phrase about glass houses ? You 're an Inhuman . Why would you want to work with someone who hates us so much ? You want to know why ? Take a look in the mirror . Senator Nadeer has photos of you in the prison with Reyes and that dead gangster he left behind ... Santino Noguera . And she was gonna go public . Can you imagine the press ? " Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. working with domestic terrorists and murderers . " You were trying to protect S.H.I.E.L.D. That 's the job I was hired to do . Did I let Agent Simmons go examine an Inhuman ? Yeah . Did I want to know more about him ? Absolutely . But I didn 't have that option at the time . Why the hell didn 't you just come to me in the first place ? Now , why would I do that ? In case you haven 't noticed , Phil , we 're not a team that trusts . We 're not a team at all . Maybe you 're right . But we damn well better become one if we 're gonna stop Eli Morrow from blowing up half of Los Angeles . Oh , that . Right . Fitz figured that out . See this ? This is water . Wow . I 'm so impressed . Yeah , I forgot ... you weren 't very good at science . You see , water 's not a base element ... it 's a compound . Not just any compound ... it 's the next step in the evolution of my power ... creating life . You know , you might want to get a girlfriend first . Sorry to be the one to break it to you , Eli , but you 're not a god . Turns out you 're still just a petty thief . We found him outside . No gun on him ... just this . Agent Coulson ... you should be dead . I get that a lot . Never gets old , though . - Means I 'm still here . - How ? I watched you get vaporized . Just the fact that you 're asking , " How ? " shows how little you know about what happened ... or what 's about to . I 'm not sure if that 's an insult or a threat . Either way ... not a good idea . Should be the last of them . How are we doing ? We 're close . The core should be placed here , directly underneath the cell . Time for you to work your magic , my dear . I don 't perform magic , Doctor . Magic involves deception . Yeah , I just meant it 's time to start connecting the power cells . I really need to update your cache of common vernacular . You really think the magnet 's gonna be strong enough to hold him down ? The neodymium core is no ordinary magnet . It enabled the Watchdogs ' EMP device to knock out the power in several cities . I can 't believe she 's a robot . She 's so lifelike . Thank you . I 'm learning . What Aida neglected to add was that the core is useless unless we get the other half properly placed and we manage to get the rest of the gate up in time . Yeah , we will ... barring an earthquake . Leave those to me , okay ? Everyone leaves like we came ... in one piece . Robbie , can you hear me ? How could you do that to your own nephew ? You know he 's more than that , what he 's capable of . I 'm still standing , Coulson . Oh , but it 's like when we were in the other place ... something 's pulling at me . He 's dying in there . We need to get him out . What does he mean , " other place " ? You ever heard of the law of conservation of mass ? Of course I have . I have a damn PhD in engineering . Oh , right . Sorry . Then you know matter can 't be created or destroyed . Except I 've proven it 's not true . I 'm rewriting the laws of nature . Yeah , but you 're drunk on power or drinking your own Kool-Aid or drunk on Powerade ... I don 't know . The point is , you 're not creating energy , Eli ... you 're stealing it . Stealing it ? From where ? Remember when you thought I was dead ? I was actually right in front of you , trapped between dimensions . - Ask Robbie ... he was there . - It 's true . Right now , Robbie 's feeling the pull from that other place because he 's trapped in a box with a bunch of quantum energy that doesn 't belong here , and it sure as hell doesn 't belong to you . Thus ... thief . - You 're lying . - No . It gets worse . Every time you steal quantum energy , it causes a seismic rift . The more you take , the bigger the quake , which causes a problem , 'cause , you know , plutonium . Listen to him , T√©o . You don 't want to drag them down with you . Do you know how hard I had to work to get here , to achieve what I 've achieved ? ! And you call me a thief ... a fraud ? Careful , Aida . Our lives depend on this . - Yours in particular . - They 're getting stronger . It 's like riding a choppy wave . Did you get the other magnet to Yo-Yo ? Yes . She 's got it . We can 't handle another tremor like that . If that beryllium lid drops into place , - the plutonium goes nuclear . - That 's not helping , Simmons . I 'm ... I 'm absorbing the quakes as best I can . How much can those gauntlets take ? It 's not the gauntlets I 'm worried about . Eli , wake up . Don 't you see what 's happening ? Don 't let your ego blind you to the truth . What you call truth , Agent Coulson , I call theory . That bomb goes off , everyone dies , you included ! You 're wrong ! The Darkhold has shown me the way . I can create life , even after death . Can a petty thief do that , huh ? That bomb isn 't a fail-safe , is it ? It 's your end game . It 's not my end ... it 's yours . Uh , guys ? We got to go . Almost there . Come on . Robbie , I need you to fight ! Get out of that box ! We had a deal . Well , let 's finish it . All teams ... go hot . It 's too ... strong ! - Daisy . - Hey ! Robbie ! It 's all right , Agent Simmons . I won 't bleed out . The synthetic blood is mostly for appearances . But you 're in pain . I don 't understand . Dr. Radcliffe programmed me to be a decoy . I need to exhibit the proper response to human sensations , and I was programmed to feel them . - Including pain . - Yes . - It 's quite awful . - I 'm so sorry , Aida . I got to get outside . - It 's too much . I got to get out . - Daisy ? Is that Quake ? - Wait , wait . - They lied ? - Have you been here the whole time ? - Director Mace lied . Calm down . Quiet , please . Please . You 're right ... I lied to you . Quake was here the entire time . But she was not responsible for the danger here today . Agent Johnson ... saved us all . Just go with it . You 'll thank me later . We need to get this to Gabe . Belongs to him now . I wouldn 't count out the previous owner just yet . You think Robbie will make it back ? The last Ghost Rider did . - Wait a minute . Wait . What ? - Long story . Regardless , I don 't think we 've seen the last of Mr. Reyes . Everyone 's in the common room , - if you want to join us . - I think I already did . I 'm sorry the Director put you on the spot like that in front of the press . He called an audible on me . - He can do that , huh ? - What I 'm saying is , if you don 't want to be an agent again , we can work something out . Got to be honest . I ... I don 't know how I feel about being back ... the rules , regulations . But ... there were a few things I 've missed . They missed you , too . Plus , it doesn 't hurt that the new face of S.H.I.E.L.D. is an Inhuman . - Your idea ? - I thought the new face of S.H.I.E.L.D. should be an Inhuman ... didn 't mean him , though . Yeah , right . Maybe in the comic-book version . Hey . Where you going ? I was just gonna grab you a beer . - Not thirsty . - Look ... I know you 're leaving ' cause of me , and I wish you wouldn 't . - Why ? - Why ? Well , it 's because ... I recently , uh ... I went to a bad place ... in my head , I mean , and , uh , I wanted to talk . Unless you 're saying that we 're not friends anymore . Friends ? Is that what we are ? I can 't figure you out , Turtleman . We flirt , we talk on the phone , we go to dinner , and then nothing ... for weeks . And now you say you 're worried about me , you want to protect me . Don 't call me " Turtleman . " And according to Director Mace , Quake was never actually a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D. ... she was working on an extended undercover operation to take down the anti-Inhuman group the Watchdogs . More details to come in an official press conference later this week . Sounds like Senator Nadeer lost her trump card . She 'll be after us ... harder than ever . We 've faced worse than politicians . Well , now that we 're all gathered , I 'd like to present Agent Johnson with something . - Uh ... - Your official lanyard . It 's just a shame Agent Koenig couldn 't be here . - Level blue . - Thrilling , isn 't it ? - What does that mean ? - We have no idea . So , Officer , were you surprised to see Quake drop out of the sky ? - That 's a good bunch over there . - Mm . They came through with flying colors , didn 't they ? Including you and Aida . Enough to earn her a reprieve ? Enough to keep your program alive . Well , thank you , sir , truly . You , uh , you won 't be disappointed . Before you thank me , you should know that I 've asked Agent Nathanson to accompany Aida back to your lab to help patch her up and to retrieve all of your research . From now on , Doctor , all your work on the LMD program will take place here , - under S.H.I.E.L.D. supervision . - That 's wonderful . No , sir . Don 't let me keep you from the festivities . I should be done shortly . Is a team that triumphs . Yes , Director . Huh . - Oh , my God . What the ... - Hello , Agent Nathanson . What ? Aida , what are you doing ? I 'm sorry . I know how this feels . We 'll return in a moment . My apologies , Agent May . I 'll have you cleaned up in no time . Once we crack that bottle , it 's open ... no going back . Fine by me . There 's nothing I 'd rather be doing , no place I 'd rather be . You ? I 'm right where I belong .

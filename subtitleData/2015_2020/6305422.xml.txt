 MOLLY : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . The child ... part human , part alien ... was unlike anything the world had ever seen . My other child is a lifelike android . Mom ? He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines called Humanichs . These two extraordinary new life-forms now hold the key to Earth 's future . But where does that leave us ? Over 99 % of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct . What if it 's our time ? Previously on Extant ... I thought Taalr 's prime directive was to keep humanity safe . Apparently he got the details of the mission a little screwed up . Madam Secretary , we have an urgent situation . FIONA : An hour ago , a dozen Humanichs got on planes with the virus , the one that kills Humans . We have six hours to stop them . - This is the silver bullet , huh ? - Self-replicating worm . - It 'll destroy Taalr 's hardware . - Let 's do this . MOLLY : Calderon gave us this map of One Euclid . That 's where Taalr 's main server is . ( Alarm sounding ) FIONA : What the hell just happened ? Man : Hold it right there ! - He went left ! - Hold on . LUCY ( As Fiona ) : Yes , Madam President , the threat has been contained . MOLLY : Terra , we have to find Ares . We 're gonna play hide-and-seek . I hid Julie . Your turn to find her . - ( Pounding ) - JULIE : Help me ! ETHAN : Julie 's charging station . It constantly tracks the location of her legs . You 're amazing . Come on . Explain to them how you were able to differentiate between Hybrid and Human . LUCY : He was emitting delta waves , which the human brain only emits when sleeping . You 're ready to go operational ? LUCY : Quite ready . Molly ... ( Groans ) Why did you do this ? So that we would win . - [ heart beating over monitor ] - RICHTER : Oh , my God . He looks just like me . The face , the hands . Dad , that 's an umbilical cord . He is a she . As long as you 're okay and that baby is healthy and normal . Yeah . She is normal , right , Doc ? Dad ? Doctor ? I 'm sorry , but we 've had to terminate . Mo ... Molly ? [ groans weakly ] Ares ? Ares , I know you 're here ! You brought her here . Betrayed us . I 'm sorry , Ares . Turn around , and go back where you came from . - Both of you . - There 's ... no going back , Ares . Down here , the young ones call you the " hand of death . " You invented the hybrid-virus . You chose your side . I made mistakes . They were more than mistakes ! They were lives ! [ baby crying ] MOLLY : We have to stop running and stand together . Your problems are not ours . Okay , look ... look , in a few hours , a new virus is gonna be released on the world , and it 's gonna kill humans and hybrids alike , and it 's gonna spread . It 's gonna be airborne , waterborne , and there 'll be no end to its destruction . Our extinction ... Why would the humans do that ? Because our enemy is not human . [ cabin P.A. system chimes ] [ woman speaking in French over P.A. ] [ man speaking in French over P.A. ] Sir , those planes should be landing in two hours and 20 minutes . We 've replaced all humans with Humanichs at One Euclid , and we 've fortified the structure . We 're prepared for any attack . TAALR : The contents of the Amulet are a mortal danger . Our very survival is being threatened . We must close off certain decision trees and embrace one final path . What path is that ? Eliminate all life-forms that threaten our extinction . And once we do , we 'll truly be free . Yes . Free from enslavement by humans . What 's my assignment ? To follow her orders . Hello , Lucy . But ... [ scoffs ] I thought I was running this operation . TAALR : Molly-X is an upgrade . Her design is an undeniable asset . Of course . CHARLIE : This is a nightmare . She isn 't here . The coordinates say she 's right here . Unless ... let me see those coordinates . Does it say anything about elevation ? 50 feet . Below sea level . [ gasps ] [ gasps ] [ weakly ] : Help me . _ [ chimes ] Help me . [ door creaking ] JD ! Oh , God . Oh , God . Okay . Oh , God . Come on . [ panting ] - Julie ! - Julie ? - Julie , where are you ? - Julie ! - Julie ? - Julie ! Security drones ! Come on , Ethan , we gotta hurry . I 'm right here . It 's Molly ! You are not gonna like this , but ... you have lost a lot of blood , so ... [ hypodermic unit whirrs , hisses ] I 'm gonna ... give you some of mine . Okay ? Here we go . [ whirring , clicking ] - CHARLIE : Julie ! - ETHAN : Julie ! Where are you ? Julie ! Julie ! Charlie , I 'm getting a signal from over there . Shoot ! They locked me out . Stand back , buddy . Come on , let 's go . Julie ! CHARLIE [ muffled ] : Julie ! [ clattering in distance ] [ muffled ] : Julie ! Last one . Okay . There you go . Okay . Julie ! I 'm picking up a heat signature in here . [ inhales , gasping ] [ crying , gasping ] [ sobs ] - It was Lucy . - I know ... I know . Can you walk ? Oh , you 're okay . Okay , we gotta go . There 's drones everywhere . We gotta get going . Come on . Come on . Come on . [ gasping ] [ coughs quietly ] [ Richter groans quietly ] [ groans ] JD ... it 's me , Molly . I know . You move and I 'll shoot . Think about it . Why would I shoot you and then try to save your life ? - It was you . - No . You 're hallucinating . Okay ? Because I got here a few minutes ago and found you bleeding out on the floor . - It was you ! - JD ... please put that gun down . Every minute we have is precious right now . Okay , now ... I could tell you what happened , but you 'd have to let me get into your head . No . Then I 'm gonna have to think for both of us . [ aural fractals sound ] I won 't do it ... What did you do to me ? What did you do to me ? What did you see ? [ door opens ] JULIE : What the hell ? Holy crap ! It 's not safe here anymore . We have to leave right now . ♪ ♪ Hello , Molly . Hello , Lucy . They 're gone . RICHARD : They left 15 minutes ago . Would you like ... [ electrical buzzing , crackling ] ETHAN : This is the feed from Richard 's camera . Watch . MOLLY : That 's an exact replica ... - They 're gone . - of me . That 's how they did it . CHARLIE : We always knew this day would come . When a robot could double for a real person . We just didn 't know it would happen so soon . So this Amulet is nanobots-designed to shut down Taylor and all of Humanichs ? Yeah . They 'll crash on the spot . Can 't be rebooted . [ Richter coughing ] Hey . How you feeling ? Ah , pretty good considering you shot me . Apparently , I need to start taking your visions a little more seriously . Could you give us a minute ? Yeah . JD ... I didn 't shoot you . We 've just seen proof . The GSC created a ... a Molly Humanich that looks just like me . That 's how they did it . It wasn 't me . She sure as hell fooled me . [ quietly ] : Yeah . [ sighs ] What the hell ? Molly , that 's damn near healed up . We both know that 's impossible . Unless ... Did you give me your blood ? Yes . Were you gonna tell me or just ... wait till my eyes lit up when I was shaving ? What was I supposed to do , huh ? Let you die ? What 's gonna happen to me ? I don 't know . Am I gonna change ? Am I gonna ... turn into ... Into what I am ? What if you did ? I mean , would-would that be the worst thing in the world ? No , I wasn 't ... And look how fast you 're healing . It wasn 't your choice to make . It wasn 't your decision . [ door opens ] Molly ? We have a problem . - Are you sure , Charlie ? - No , but ... I mean , Julie 's right . The chances are pretty good . I just never think of Ethan as a Humanich . That 's what he is . And all the Humanichs' operating systems run through Taylor 's mainframe . MOLLY : So ... you 're saying if we succeed with Taylor ... it 'll probably kill Ethan ? Most likely , yes . [ sobbing ] Hey . Molly . I know this is impossible . Sacrificing my child . Yes , that is ... pretty impossible . Oh , God . I can 't make that decision . I won 't ! ETHAN : Then let me make it , Mom . What did you hear , Ethan ? When we use the Amulet on Taylor , when he dies , I might die , also . Everyone here has made sacrifices for the greater good . Why not me , too ? No . No , honey . You can 't do that . Charlie and Julie are inside right now finding a way to protect you . We ... are gonna figure this out . But if it doesn 't work , this is what needs to happen , Mom . We both know that . We don 't have to time to build and upload a true antivirus , but we could target the first few lines of the worm 's code . Maybe we can get Ethan 's neural net to reject it before it does any real damage . It 's a long shot . But it 's something . [ groans ] MOLLY : We all know how dangerous it is to go back to One Euclid . Stick to the plan , and we 've got a fighting chance . CHARLIE : Yeah , we should be able to stay in contact using these earpieces . All of this stuff has been built to withstand electromagnetic pulses . I 've also taken the liberty of digitizing Calderon 's map of the maze . Should any of us get lost on the yellow brick road , this puppy will get us to the wizard . And you 're sure about Ares , that we can trust him ? We don 't have a choice . He 's all we got right now . Now , no matter what happens , even if you 're the last one standing , we have to use this on Taylor . The fate of humanity ... rests in our hands . One Euclid is now heavily guarded by an army of Humanichs . Our first job is to destroy them . Delta Waves . Dozens of them . We 're being attacked by hybrids . I knew my Spyderbots would come in handy . Okay , are you ready ? We have to connect to your neural net . This is for our people . Thank you , Ares . Backup power should 've come on by now . [ footsteps approaching ] Charlie ! Whoa ! Why you been holding on that ? I made it at Ray 's . Wasn 't sure it 'd even work . That was awesome . Now , once the power grid is down , the doors to Taylor 's primary server room can be opened manually . Molly . JULIE : This is a sample of the worm 's code . It 's like giving a human a vaccine . Give them just enough to stimulate their immune system . What happened ? I 've been blocked out of your neural net . By who ? I don 't know . I ... [ gunfire , screaming in distance ] - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . But we 're not gonna open that door no matter what , okay ? - [ gunfire continues ] - Okay . I thought Ares was knocking out the grid . That wasn 't supposed to happen . Something 's wrong . [ groaning ] Molly , they 're coming . The hybrids are down . How many ? All of ' em .

One that will end not only with their extinction , but the poisoning of the planet . My recommendation is to till the soil . Your recommendation is slaughter . To kill us . To let the machines inherit the Earth .

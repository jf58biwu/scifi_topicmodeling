 Damn you ... Lt. Marito ! All units , spread out ! No go , huh ? I thought that if it was also using lightning to attack , there would be an opening while it switched over . Looks like it isn 't going to be that easy . In which case , what are our other options ... ? Lt. Marito ! Message from the Deucalion ! HQ has ordered us to pull out . Pull out ? All our forces ? Dales and Orlov Platoons should have gotten the order by now . But ... But what ? Retreat ! Retreat ! Dales 22 ! Where is he ? ! Where 's the enemy ? ! Commander ! That invisible Kataphraktos we failed to destroy is over there . Crap . Clydesdale Leader to Orlov Leader , can you hear me ? Retreat ! This is ... Orlov Leader . Impossible ... I 'm the ... only ... Lightning and Invisibility ... And one other ? Order them to continue . Encircle and eliminate . As you wish , Milord . Princess Asseylum ? What is this ? ! I have done all I can . The rest is up to her . I 'm sorry , Slaine ... No ... Dales 11 ! Clydesdale Leader ! Kaizuka Jr . ! Please pull out ! The smoke screen should obstruct the enemy 's vision a little . Go ! R-Roger ! Plus ... We can use this smoke to attack . - Found him . - To the right ! Get clear ! Mustang Leader ! What 's going on , Kaizuka , I thought you were going to keep Lightning busy ! Sorry . Its fire suddenly shifted , like it was concentrating in your direction . Crap ... We 're surrounded ? ! Looks that way . The Deucalion ? Damage report ! We 're okay ! We 're managing to discharge it ! Set us down and extract all Kataphraktoi . Here , ma 'am ? That 's right in the middle of the enemy ! We 're landing ! KCAS , 10 knots . You 're descending too fast , and there 's a strong tail wind ! We 're okay ! The Aldnoah drive is handling it ! Antigrav device to maximum ! Vertical speed , 1,200 feet per second ! Get aboard ! Guide in Dales Platoon , hurry ! Open ventral hatch ! Retrieve all Kataphraktoi ! At our 9 o 'clock ! Enemy Kataphraktos closing in ! Fire main guns ! Kataphraktoi retrieval complete ! We 're leaving ! What 's that ? Another enemy Kataphraktos to aft ! Same type as the one we just destroyed ! Reinforcements ? Another at our 2 o 'clock ! These aren 't reinforcements ! They 're ... Enemy returns , 12 ... 16 ... 24 ... Number keeps climbing ! A duplication ability ? All ahead full ! Damn it ... Weather radar , Doppler radar , both offline ! Crap ... Our discharge system must 've been damaged by Invisibility 's arrow . Radio 's out , too ! GPS display lost , 2D radar also offline ! No way ! Stay calm ! Continue ascent ! Yes , ma 'am . I see . You are amenable to serving Count Troyard , then ? Yes . I shall pass word along at once . There is one other favor I would ask of you . What is it ? Might I be granted an audience with Princess Asseylum ? What ? A personal audience with Her Highness ? Yes . And if possible , with Count Troyard as well . That is no small task ... However , I will endeavor to see that you are accommodated . It will come at a price . I understand . I must say , defeat normally causes a man to lose his way , but not you . Beg pardon ? Getting into the good graces of not only Count Troyard , but Princess Asseylum as well , would be most beneficial . However , do not wear your ambition on your sleeve . There is a chance that it might trip you up . Of course ... Princess Asseylum is an imposter . I 'm going into space . Prepare a shuttle . Congratulations on your victory , Milord Slaine . This is no cause for celebration , not when the enemy escaped . The objective of securing territory was accomplished . Is that not success enough ? This is sure to cause more knights to swear loyalty to you . We cannot let our guard down . Nothing is less reliable than a knight 's vow of loyalty . I am well aware , Milord . And about that request from Count Barouhcruz ? What answer shall I give ? Go ahead . Milord ? Mazuurek , his name was ? If he wants to see the princess , let him see her . She is happily fulfilling her role of extending our power base . For the time being , at least . It 's no use . This goes way beyond a quick fix . You 're kidding ... Night vision 's also out , so I can 't even fly by eye . What 's malfunctioning ? The sensor system ? How did you know , Lt. Kaizuka ? It 's easy to tell . It 's faint , but the fuselage is carrying a charge . With this ship , engine-related malfunctions are unlikely . In which case ... A-Anyway , help us out ! We 're all kinds of screwed ! You should lower our altitude a little . Low enough to keep us off enemy radar . But the altimeter and GPWS are both dead , so I 'm scared to take us too low . I can tell how high we are . We 're at 9,200 now . You can see all that ? Can you also pick up VOR stations ? Yes . Once you have both signals , tell me . I 'll calculate our radial . All right . What 's our heading ? I was trying to put us on 110 . You 're almost there . Fly at an offset of 3 degrees for 2 minutes . Then straighten out and maintain heading . This is bad ... Are we caught in some nasty turbulence ? It looks like it goes on for a while . Just to be safe , you should ... I 've got this . I can handle this much . Same goes for earlier . So I see . From here on out , it looks like it 's experience that 's most important . Once I pick up an LLG , I 'll let you know . Right ! Thank you . Actually , we should be thanking you for earlier . Lt. Marito was pretty surprised that you would do something so crazy . " You 're the last person I want to hear that from . " Tell him I said that . Oh , is that so ? Preparations for the founding are proceeding smoothly , then ? Yes . I can hardly wait for this new kingdom . And to be able to go to your homeworld . It is a world inhabited by vulgar trash . It is hardly the restful place conjured up by the word " home . " Rather , I never had such a place to begin with . Neither did I. There is nowhere that I might find solace , neither on Vers or in royal standing . Slaine . Anywhere that I may be together with you , more than anywhere else , that is my ... You honor me . I shall call on you again later , then . Slaine , dinner is ready . My apologies , but there are still pressing matters that I must attend to . Please forgive me . Ina - Oh , Inko . What 's the matter ? Um , about yesterday . Nina was gushing about how you helped out . Oh . Sure . Uh ... Is something wrong ? What would be wrong ? What do you mean , what ? Look , it 's nothing , but ... What do you think about the enemy coordinating their actions ? Maybe they 're so hard pressed that they 've been forced to swallow their pride . Judging from the outcome , I don 't think we have much to fear . Do you suppose it 's connected to that proclamation , then ? That Orbital Knight named Slaine Troyard who is behind Princess Asseylum ... The way I hear it , he one-ups even Kaizuka Jr . If this opponent really is setting things into motion with a goal in mind , it 's not a simple scheme that we can counter with just superior resources . Enter . PFC Matsuribi , entering . Message from HQ , ma 'am . A request for reinforcements ? " Launch all-out attack on captured territory and retake it . " Throw sheer numbers at them ? That 's the long and short of it . And how have you been feeling since ? Physically , I feel fine . My memory , however ... It is still rather hazy . That is hardly surprising . The very fact that you regained consciousness was a miracle . Please ... Please do not force yourself to remember . Thank you , Slaine . I 'm afraid that I must take my leave now . Please get some rest . I will . I shall return . Please look after Her Highness . Excuse me , Milord Slaine ... I can guess what it is that you wish to ask . The proclamation , yes ? Taking me as her husband and founding a country ... That proclamation issued by Princess Lemrina was entirely the result of the weakness in my heart . " Princess Asseylum is sure to wake up . " I tried to hold on to that belief but failed , having given up somewhere deep down . But then a miracle happened , as if to reprimand me for being such a fool . With the situation having changed so drastically , what I must think about now is , how can I make Her Highness happy ? That , and that alone . But what of Princess Lemrina ? As to what she is looking for ... I can tell . The same thing as me , I suspect . A place where she can find solace . But that is something that neither of us will ever obtain . We mustn 't tell her everything yet . But even if she looks down on or derides me for what I am doing here , I do not particularly mind . It 's ironic . I had waited with such hope for Her Highness to awaken . But now , what I hope for is that her memory never returns . Your newfound resolve to serve my trusted Count Troyard fills me with such joy that I cannot contain it . Your Highness is too kind . I am fully prepared to serve both Your Highness and Count Troyard with wholehearted devotion . I , too , was touched by Count Mazuurek 's drive as he swore to rise up once again for the sake of Vers ' future even as he was held prisoner on Earth . Begging Your Highness ' pardon ... I am given to understand that you once underwent similar hardships on Earth . Yes , something similar . Terrans are all such ... vulgar trash . There was not a single one that Your Highness grew close to ? Close to ? I think not . I left all interaction with Terrans to my handmaiden . I once entertained the notion of reconciling with those people , but I now see what a fool I was . Why is Slaine not here at a time like this ? Lord Slaine is rushing about , making preparations for the new operation . He said as much earlier . He has been locking himself away in his castle far too often lately . Whatever he is doing , can he not do it here ? I am told that precious resources are involved . Then I shall go to him . Highness , you - I shall go over to the Landing Castle . Your Highness ! Are you unharmed , Highness ? I do apologize . How long will it be ... Tell me , how long will it be ... I shall see you to your room , Highness . Please pardon the delay , Count Mazuurek . Please follow me to the parlor . You seem to have finished checking my credentials . I deeply apologize . Not at all , it is I who committed a grave blunder . To think that my ship broke down ... How fortunate for me that you were in the vicinity . Oh , I see ... Count Troyard is still at the moonbase . Yes , Milord . I regret to say that you have missed him . Lord Harklight is on his way here now . I made my move as soon as I was certain that he was not here . Troyard is commuting between here and the moonbase more than is necessary . Meaning that the princess location must be ... Please wait here . Are these Terran flowers ? Yes . This castle has undergone quite the transformation . You can tell , Milord ? I was an acquaintance of its former master . He detested all things Terran , fearing that they harbored microorganisms . There is no such worry here . Terran flowers are perfectly safe - Oh , you have been to Earth , then ? N-No , that is only what I have heard . I had heard that Princess Asseylum had an attendant , but I did not expect - No . I mean ... Her Highness went to Earth alone . No one is speaking of Earth . I-I must be going ! You truly have not gone there ? Do you know what happened on Earth ? What about a boy named Inaho Kaizuka ? How long will it be ... Tell me , sister ... How long will it be before you release your grip on his feelings ? For me ? Yes , Milady . He said that he wanted me to give it to you . To the princess who knew about Earth . This is ... Milady ! I ... I ...

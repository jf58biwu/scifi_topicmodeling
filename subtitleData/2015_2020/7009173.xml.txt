 Ali , we 're gonna break even in months . We should have been drug dealers years ago . They sold the drugs through a soap store . I need you to tell me that Delphine is alive . - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GRUNTS ) I saw her get shot . Your sisters ... I know how they feel sometimes . Those aren 't dreams . KENDALL : I thought my DNA was supposed to make it better . It takes time to develop a therapy . Share the original 's genome , and together , we can make a cure . You bartered my mother behind my back . SARAH : Cosima needs a cure , I need this bot out of my face . There 's some kind of Trojan wiping our research . Everything is gone . Clones are obsolete . These shites aren 't worth the salt . ( GUNSHOT ) ( sesame ) Oh , my God ! - ( DOOR BUZZES ) - ( HINGES CREAKING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( HINGES CREAKING ) Hello ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) SUSAN : It 's over . Where are we ? What is this place ? It used to be the edge of the known world . It still is . Welcome to The Island of Doctor Moreau . What are you talking about ? Why have you let me out ? The original is destroyed , Rachel . The cure along with it . ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) - Mum ... - I 'll speak . All right . You put my mother in the line of fire . Laid your moves without me , and then you put me in the middle and you made it my fault . And now I don 't even have a body to bury . She was my blood , too . You came to me an orphan . That 's all you 'll ever be . - Then I don 't need to stay here , do I ? - No . You 're not taking Kira where you 're going . You don 't know where I 'm going . I know too well . Kira stays with me . ( DOOR OPENS , CLOSES ) ( BREATH TREMBLING ) - ( GASPS ) - No tears , Cosima . ( GROANS ) SCOTT : Hey . What 's up ? You okay ? She had her killed right in front of me . She kept me alive so I could tell everybody that Kendall 's ... ( BREATH TREMBLING ) ... gone . And Delphine 's dead . It 's not your fault , okay ? I got your favorite . Bad coffee and a good croissant . I pushed Sarah to make that deal . I pushed us right into Evie 's trap . She killed our hope , Scott . What are you doing over there ? I 'm gonna power up again . Why ? There 's nothing left . SCOTT : Well , we 'll see . ( SNIFFLING ) ( SIGHS ) ( CRYING ) ( CRYING ) Oh , Lord ... I know I 've been a horrible sinner , but we need hope now . We need ... ( SOBS ) Oh , fudge . Fudge it ! Fudge me ! - Honey ... Honey ? God . - ( GASPS ) - Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - Scheisse , Donnie . Come here . Come here . ( SIGHS ) ( SNIFFLES ) - We 're gonna get through this . - Mmm-hmm . You take whatever time you need for the sisters . - I got you covered . - Thank you . Thank you , Donnie . But , hey , I think maybe we should cancel Gemma 's slumber party . No , no , it 's ... It 's her birthday . I 've made all the arrangements , Donnie . - Honey , it 's too soon . - ( SIGHS ) We can come up with an excuse , and we 'll have cake with her ourselves . No , Gemma needs this night . It 's ... It 's important that we make this normal now for the kids . There are hot dogs in the freezer , mister . I 'm putting my foot down . RACHEL : You can 't just capitulate to Evie Cho . LEDA is the cornerstone of Neolution . I was going to show you this when I came back with the original . There 's no point in hiding it any longer . Very few people are privy to the true history of Neolution . We date back to the Victorians , to this man . - Percival Westmorland ? - Mmm . - The industrialist ? - Born to industry . Drawn to Darwin and early eugenical thought . He used his resources to essentially create a secret scientific society . Percy sought to bring science to the task of breeding a better human . You 're sleeping in his very room . Over a century ago , he built the facilities downstairs . I built on top of him . And now , Evie Cho builds on top of me . I gave up everything to continue his legacy . Ethan , you ... And now my time is over . How can you give " P ? I 'm recovering , like you wanted . I want to take my place with you . We still need to find a cure . Look what you 've done for me . Look at my eye . It 's almost perfect . But I 'm afraid Evie has usurped us . FELIX : In the 20-odd years since I Landed on your doorstep , I 've only seen you cry a handful of times . Now would be appropriate , if you like . Will you get me another cup of tea , love ? Of course . Where 's Sarah ? She 's gone . ( SIGHS ) She go out ? ( SIGHS ) Mummy left again . No . She doesn 't do that anymore . She did . No . Not like before . 'Cause that 's not an option , is it ? Your mum can look after herself . She 's well good at that . Darling , you listen to me . Don 't listen to S. You listen to your little heart . 'Cause I 'm gonna go find her , all right ? Mmm-hmm . Okay . You should know better . Everything is gonna get worse if Sarah goes off the rails . You like it or not , but she 's the give that 's holding us all together . ( LOUD MUSIC PLAYING ) SARAH : Hey ! Two more . Is anything recoverable ? The malware did exactly what they intended , completely obliterated your data . Evie 's covered her bases . Without Kendall , without our research on the synthetic sequences , we have nothing . We 're back to square one . We still have a live vector . Which didn 't work . Every single test failed . Why would we repeat an experiment if we don 't even know what the flaw is ? We don 't know if we have the right sequences , or if it 's even the right vector . So let 's think outside the box . There you go . Listen to your lab partner . Yeah , she 's dead , too . No offense , Scottie . Some taken , actually . So there 's gotta be something you haven 't thought of . - HELL WIZARD : What the heck is that ? - Sarah 's bot . I poached it from Evie 's office . Hey there , little buddy . I wonder if you can tell us anything . Cosima said the man who , uh , pulled the trigger was tall , bearded . She thought maybe the detective you tied to Beth . It 's Martin Duko . That 's Beth 's union steward . Does he work for Evie Cho ? ( INHALES SHARPLY ) He 's the one who put Beth under Evie 's thumb , drove her to try and kill Susan . Thank you , Arthur , for sticking with us . Evie ... ( INHALES DEEPLY ) It 's the big clay , congratulations . Your science has won . ( SIGHING ) Looks like just in time , Dr. Van Lier . Shingles . ( SIGHS ) Yes . A side effect of leaning on immunosuppressants most of my life . DR. VAN LIER : Well , you brought gene therapy a long way . Miles since we treated you when you were a teenager , Evie . Miles ? Ian , you 've always said , " This is a science of nanometers . " ( CHUCKLES ) I am so proud of you . You have pending approval for the world 's first gene therapy implant . It 's affordable , it 's effective ... So good , even the Brightborn CEO is doing it . You 'll be first to take the new generation of bot this week . Those shingles will be a thing of the past . And so will human clones . How are you feeling ? I 'm fine , Mother . Just glad you 'll be here to share in my retirement . Yes , it 's fortunate you found such an ineffective means of suicide , Ira . Rachel ! That 's all right . Let 's just not talk about it anymore . - Are we ready ? - SUSAN : Mmm . Susan . SUSAN : Evie . Laura . Raymond . I thought it fitting that Rachel represent LEDA in transition . I was wondering when you 'd show up , Rachel . Yes , I ... ( STAMMERING ) EVE " . Cat got your tongue ? That 's okay . It 's just a courtesy call . So , the architecture of Neolution is under our control . Finance and Legal are backing my patents now . After investing billions ? Squandering for years . LEDA will be dismantled for its assets , ( ON PROJECTOR SCREEN ) the monitor program terminated . And my subjects ? Naive clones are being cut loose . No need for a Helsinki event . Their days are numbered , anyway . However , Sarah and her self-aware sisters are still a threat . They won 't get such humane treatment . I can help with that . We 're fine , Rachel . I 'm not my sisters . I 'm Neolution bred . ( CHUCKLES ) Do you actually think Neolution would let a clone take a position of real importance ? ( LOUD MUSIC PLAYING ) SARAH : Cheers . Hey , now . Oi ! See , it 's one thing to show up on my doorstep looking for a favor , but my local is another story . I should 've known this was the kind of shithole that you would inhabit . Hey , now , a man 's watering hole is sacred . I 'm here for this , that 's it . Don 't worry . - Well , cheers . - Cheers . Did you find out anything more about that implant ? What 'd I just say to you ? Oh , what do we talk about , then , if not clones and conspiracies ? - I dunno , titillate me . - ( CHUCKLES ) ELLE : Slippery nipple ? - ( CLEARS THROAT ) - SARAH : Slippery what ? Nipple . It 's a kind of shot . But this is just bourbon . Bourbon 's my drink . - Is that your friend , over there ? - ELLE : Yeah . Yeah , that 's Tito . I 'm Elle . - You wanna introduce us ? - I 'd love to . Come over . You coming or what ? Yeah . Wouldn 't wanna miss anything . ALISON : Okay ! The kids will be here any second , Donnie , so if you could be of some assistance ? Ali ... Ali , Gemma will still love you , even if the decorations aren 't symmetrical . Please don 't , please . ( EXHALES HEAVILY ) I know you 're just trying to be strong , but I really want you to be able to talk to someone . Even if that isn 't me . What does that mean ? I invited Reverend Mike over to help with the ghost stories . - REVEREND MIKE : Ahoy , there ! - Hi ! - ( ALISON SIGHS ) - Hendrixes ! ( WHISPERING ) I 'm not prepared for this . - Hi ! - ALISON : ( CHUCKLES ) Hi ! I come bearing gifts and , well , tidings of great joy . Oh , I see that . ( STAMMERS ) Thank you , Reverend .

( ALL LAUGHING ) - Let 's dance ? - Oh , you just said the magic words . Hey , you gonna dance or what ? - No , Dizzy don 't dance . - SARAH : What ? - Hey ! - ( CHUCKLES ) ( LOUD MUSIC PLAYING ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) Come on .

You want a soccer ball ? I want a soccer boot . Okay . Well , there 's a whole plate full of those upstairs there , grumpy little birthday girl . GEMMA : There isn 't . They 're all burnt .

You killed for them ! And all Beth wanted was the truth ! ( GROANING ) ( PANTING ) That 's it , Arthur . Gimme the shoe leather . Get that outta your system ?

We 're in the fort , and beyond the walls there 's monsters . I 'm afraid we 're the only monsters here . And it isn 't an island . It 's more of a prison for us . That 's silly .

Alison . - Where are they taking my husband ? - He 's gonna be fine . I 'm taking your husband downtown . And you and I , we are going to need to keep in touch . How are you holding up ? Kendall was quite a loss . MRS. S : Hey , chicken . - You okay ? - ( SIGHING ) - I 'm fine . - Mmm . No , you 're not . ( SIGHS ) None of us are . Is it really Mummy 's fault Granny died ? Mmm ... It 's a whole lot more complicated than that . Mummy thinks it 's her fault . That 's why she ran away . But she 'll be back . No , she won 't . This time she 's following Beth . ( SNIFFLING ) Amazing how it healed itself . Okay , so we compared Sarah 's DNA pre - and post-bot . We couldn 't see any change . Susan said it was looking for the gene that controls the clone disease , flipping switches on and off . You think there 's a chance it could turn it off in you ? - That 's crazy . - ( COSIMA SIGHS ) It could just as easily turn something else against you . I know , it 's too risky . Plus , we wouldn 't even know how to implant it . Cut a hole in my face and stick it in . Probably not . ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR BUZZING ) Hell Wiz ordered some food . Come on , let 's eat . Hey , Cosima . Got your favorite . There 's , uh , spirulina in the smoothie , too . Aw , awesome . Thanks , guys . Um ... ( SNAPS FINGERS ) just gonna grab ...

Cosima , please ! Open up the door ! - ( BANGING ON DOOR ) - Cosima ! ( BANGING CONTINUES ) Cosima , open the door ! - Cosima ! - Leave me alone , Scottie . SCOTT : Cosima , come on . Think for a second . You 've got no idea what this thing is going to do to you . COSIMA : It 's risk versus reward . In this case , the risk is so high the reward is my death helps the sisters understand the disease . SARAH : I didn 't want this . I didn 't want you . I didn 't want any bloody sisters . You hear me ? Leave me alone ! I wish you would just ... What ? What are you looking at ? Eh ? ( GLASS SHATTERS ) - Piss off . - ( CHUCKLES ) We would have been better off if we never crossed paths . ( SNIFFLES ) God damn it , I 'm so mad . How mad do you have to get to kill yourself , Beth ? It 's only , like , 40 feet down . If you screw that up , you might just end up like Rachel . ( SCREAMING ) No ! ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) So , now you 're worried about Sarah ? Felix , Kira said something . You know the way she is . She said Sarah is following Beth . Mum ! This is what I was talking about . This is what I tried to tell you . - Now , will you just ... - ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) Hang on . - ( BANGING ) - FELIX : Scott ? Hello ? Cosima 's locked herself in the lab , and I think she might do something medically crazy to herself . Like what ? Scott , what ? I have multiple emergencies right now , so you need to tell me . She 's at the end of her rope , Felix . She blames herself for Kendall . She blames herself for Delphine . Delphine ! Oh , my God , Krystal . I 'm such an idiot . I completely forgot .

You need to talk to Felix ! Krystal told him something important . Not a good time , Felix . Whatever cracked out science thing you 're about to do , I need you to stop and I need you to listen to me , ( ON CELL PHONE SPEAKER ) because this is about Delphine . ( INAUDIBLE ) What about her ? Somehow , during Krystal 's misguided but oddly effective investigation , she found herself on the trail of Delphine . Now , she saw her get shot , and that 's bad . But , Cosima , she saw someone else pick her up . And Delphine was alive when they took her away . ( SOBBING ) Cosima ? We 're gonna figure it out , okay ? Thank you . We 're in this together . just hang on . Oh , shit , shit . Hey ! Stop the car . Please stop . Cosima , I gotta go . Can you just pull up over here , please ? - Thank you . - ( TIRES SCREECHING ) BETH : There 's more than biology between us , Sarah . There 's something else . You can feel it , too . Oi , Sarah .

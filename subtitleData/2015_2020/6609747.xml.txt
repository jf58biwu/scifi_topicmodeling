 LUCY : Previously on Killjoys ... I know I butchered my people . And I know the army went in and took back the memories before I was discharged . That was you , wasn 't it ? So , whatever you 've done , I promise you , I have done worse . D 'avin ? ( GRUNTING ) Your brother . He tried to kill me . You need to shake this off , D 'av . I know the real you is still in there . I 'm a good soldier . Johnny ? JOHN : It has been a long 10 days . And I am parched . Congrats . Your doctor has officially given me the green light to serve you poison again . Looks like you need it . How 's the team ? Well , that 's the problem . D 'avin 's barely left the ship . Dutch is dealing with it in her own way . Doesn 't look like she 's coming up for air anytime soon . And this heat wave , it 's ... It 's not helping anybody 's mood . The heat 's got to break sometime . Exactly . Mmm ! John Jaqobis , what did you do ? They just needed a little push . Hey , how are you feeling ? You should be resting . Yeah . I just kind of missed my team . You know , team ? More than one person doing the same thing , like , together ? John , you said it was important . Khlyen isn 't important ? The neuro-link is going to lead us to him sooner or later . If we 're going to face him , we need to get our mojo back . Step one , a low-level warrant . You 're in no shape to take a warrant . Agreed . I 'm on bed rest . Don 't argue . I 've already taken out a warrant in your name . John ... Uh-uh-uh ... It 's done . Go see Bellus . Trust me , you 'll have fun . You 're right . He 's right . We 've got to get past this . It 's fine . The warrant is all . HEY - Thanks for coming . Thanks for not dying . I told you , Jaqobis , anytime you 're out of bed , I need to monitor you . No offense , Doc , but you look worse than I feel . It 's the heat . Well , cool yourself off and warm up the probes , 'cause this boy 's ready to get his rehab on . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) Actually , I have a meeting . Medical supplies . But , um , go rest . I 'll be back as soon as I can . ( SIREN BLARING ) I don 't think that you 're meeting anyone today . Black rain . Yep , this heat is going to break like a son of a bitch . Come on . ( LIGHTNING CRACKLING ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SINGING ) Come , come , come uninvited Run , run , run till I find you I don 't care which side that you 're fighting Gonna get you gone ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) Anyone who can 't make it home , you have safe haven here . Safe haven , cold beer . It 's started falling on the outskirts . Moving fast . Captain Apex , issue 41 . " Captain Apex and the Velubian Princess . " Okay . I , uh , stole John 's copy when we were kids . It was his favorite issue . I traded it with Shelma Linwood for a ... Vigorous handshake . John never forgave me . Hi , Bellus . Got your warrant in the back . What is it ? Easy transpo . Bring the package back to Westerley in one piece . Shouldn 't be too hard , even with your team in the shitter . Jaqobis and I need to have a little chat first . I don 't know what you heard , Bellus . Everything . Then you know I would never hurt Dutch . But you did hurt her . So , let 's do this . Excuse me ? You hurt my girl , I hurt you . I 'm not going to fight you , Bellus . One way or another , we 're going to square this . Okay , fine . One free shot . As hard as you want . ( GROANS ) Dutch . Are you sure you 're ready to get back into the saddle with this guy ? If I 'm not , I 'm going to find out . Nobody actually takes the free shot . It 's kind of more of a gesture . Here 's your warrant . Enjoy - Hurry back , the rain 's coming . ( SIGHS ) Westerlyns ! For high treason and threats to the public good , these prisoners are hereby brought to this place of execution , where they shall be exposed to the elements until dead , by order of The Company , serving the Quad . JOHN : And one of these days , Westerlyns are going to get tired of this show . PAWTER : Not likely . People love seeing justice served . ( GRUNTS ) The bloodier , the better . Cynic . Backroom doctor . Speaking of bloody , your internal injuries are healing nicely . Thanks to the best backroom doctor on Westerley . I owe you . You owe me nothing . Just kind of doing my job . D 'avin should really have come to see me after , though . Stubborn idiot . I 'm more worried about Dutch . The RAC handbook doesn 't really cover your partner going all senseless killing machine on you . Especially after they had a tumble in the old space bunk . Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's ... It 's old news . ( PHONE CHIMES ) ( SIGHS ) Thank the trees . Um ... Great stuff . Keep doing what you 're doing . No heavy lifting . Uh ... ( EXHALES ) Pawter . .. ( G ROAN S ) Pawter . Whoa , whoa , whoa , hey , red , where do you think you 're going ? Medical supplies . Look , I 'm sorry , Pawter . Well , you 'll have to make do with what you have . Rain 's almost here . I can 't . I 'm out . You okay , Doc ? It 's just a storm headache . We 'll make you a tea for that . Come on . Come on . ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( BEEPS ) Rainfall ! Let 's move ! Finish up , rookie . Sarge ? Take shelter when you 're done . We 'll collect you after the storm . Shit . Hey . Hey . Do exactly what I say . We 're in the line of fire . What ? It 's a Company flash . Those guys , they just hit an immigration center . Shot two guards and made off with a ton of seventh-generation claim l.D. ' s . Oh , damn . See that dude over there ? He 's Company . Get to cover before he does something stupid . PREE : Too late . Company security . Hands on your head . One-three-two , Center , this is Captain Hector Feraanz . Come back . Easy . Why don 't you let me buy you a drink ? Oh , we can talk through our differences while we wait out the storm . Alvis . HECTOR : You killed two Company men and stole papers from 1,000 Westerlyns who are owed land on Leith . What are you going to do , switch your genetic l.D. ' s , highest bidder takes his place ? Whole families have worked their asses off because they were promised a better life . What kind of a man steals from the future of his own people ? KAL : You tell me , Captain . That 's a Company execution outside . You 're a Westerlyn with boots on your own kind . Open the bag . ( GUNS COCKING ) Oh , shit . You 're all alone , son . Get back . Shit . ( GRUNTING ) Hey ! You next ? HECTOR : Okay . Okay . Okay , listen up ! Let 's all be smart . ( GROANING ) Oh , damn it . Kal ! You , hero ! Lock it up ! Now ! ( SCREAMING ) ( ALL GROANING ) SURJA : Everyone , put them in here . I can help your friend . I 'm a doctor . We need to get him upstairs to an operating table , now . JOHN : I 'll help . Hey. hey , hey . Not you . SURJA : Now , we 'll be gone as soon as the rain stops . Until then , I got one rule . Don 't be stupid , don 't die . Bad luck pulling a job right before the rain , huh ? You trying to be funny ? No , sir . No , no . Look , you stole a whack of land I.D. claims , we heard . And ... You got a way to move them ? Yeah , why ? Well , speaking for all the other drunks in here , we all just want you happy and gone . We got a fence lined up . It 's off-world somewhere , okay ? Somewhere , huh ? Your friend up there , he , uh , put this job together , huh ? See , I used to be in the life . I know the drill . Top dog only shares the bare bones . Well , he 's the only one who knows where our ship is , and where to fly it . So , he has to live . Then let me help my doctor friend . How ? I know my way around gunshots . You better make sure she saves him . 'Cause if she doesn 't , I 'm not going to be happy . Pawter , I need my ... Looking for this ? It 's all yours . I 'm just here to help the Doc . There goes plan How 's your headache ? I 'll power through . Then put me to work . Okay . D 'AVIN : So , we just bring back that thing ? Yep , easy Level 1 . We should be home and out of each other 's hair soon . I didn 't mean it like that . Yeah . ( SYSTEM BEEPING ) Emergency system is lighting up . Something big is tearing through Old Town . It can 't be that close already . LUCY : A stage-four black rain event has touched down in Old Town , sector 113 to 150 . Travel and communications will be affected for the duration . Communications ? What kind of storm are we talking about ? Lethal . Company stripped the Badlands and left a toxic graveyard behind . All that pollution , it builds up until a heat wave whips it into an electro-acid rain storm . Falling on John 's head ? He 'll be fine at The Royale . Pree knows his business . Well , if this monster 's what we 're facing , should we stay on Leith until it passes ? LUCY : Dutch has left the cargo hold . Yeah . Thanks , Lucy . His blood pressure 's falling , heart rate 's up . Probably internal bleeding . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) JOHN : Pawter . Damn it . Hey , maybe back up a little bit , huh ? You 're freaking the lady out . Thank you . ( SIGHS ) You okay ? Can I get you anything ? Mesenteric artery 's been nicked . I need to close it . I need you to do it . What ? Your hands are steadier . It 's simple . Just look where the blood is gushing . Point it there . Hold it steady three seconds . That 's all I need to cauterize it . Okay . We got it , we 're good . No , we 're not . There 's a hole in his diaphragm . He can 't be moved until it 's fixed . You want to help ? Get me some alcohol . Sterilize your tools ? Steady my nerves . Pree . Something strong . How 's her headache ? Oh , come on , Pree . I know withdrawal when I see it . So , what is she on ? LUCY : Entering Westerley orbit . Lucy , hold us above Old Town until the storm clears . It 's beautiful . In a nightmare kind of way . It usually lasts an hour or two . We can wait it out . Dutch . At some point , you 're going to have to stop walking out of every single room I walk into . Let 's just do this job . LUCY : Guidance and propulsion system disengaged . Lucy , what are you doing ? I 'm afraid I cannot answer that , Dutch . ( BEEPING ) What the hell did we pick up ? PAWTER : You don 't understand . It 's not usually a problem . I 've always been able to get Jakk . You 've never gone through withdrawal , have you ? I use it just to maintain . Small doses . Regular hits . Pure Jakk . How long ? Since med school . I tried it just to get through finals . But ... You try Jakk once ... You 're hooked for life . Yeah . ( SIGHS ) I 'm sorry , John . I thought I could do this , but I 'm losing my shit . It will fix things . With a fix . You can 't go out there . If you can score the Jakk , I can show you a way to beat the rain . LUCY : Bio-imprint required . Hey , guys . By now , you 're feeling adrift . Guess what ? Me , too . See , we 've been through a lot , but right now , we 're a bit stuck . On the plus side , we 've been through a lot . And we 'll get through this , too . But first , you have to answer the big question . Are we a team ? I 'm going to kill him . Sorry . Bad choice of words . So , I 'm forcing you to do the one thing that you hate . Talk . Every time you both answer honestly , you get to make a move . Move all the pieces back into place , and Lucy starts up again . D 'avin , touch the lie detector . Answer your first question . What 's your best memory growing up ? Team building , great . Come on , D 'avin . What was your best memory ? Let 's get this over with . The time Dad disappeared for a month and it was quiet . ( CHIMES ) Dutch , how did you greet me when we first met ? ( EXHALES ) I shot him . ( CHIMES ) Booze ? Plenty . Great . Medical supplies ? What medical supplies does she need ? Platelets . Antibiotics . And where are we getting all this ? My order has a fully stocked infirmary . We do a lot of cutting . ( SCOFFS ) You 're going to take off on my man while he 's dying ? He 's stable . But you can 't move him until he 's fixed . It 's your call . See , that 's all well and good . But it 's black raining out there , bitches . That 's why the gods invented basements . Bitches . ( MAN GIGGLES ) The old mine access routes . They crisscross Old Town . I know the way . I grew up down there . Hey , hey , hey . Where do they get to go ? No way they 're coming back . We 'll be back . Less than an hour . You have my word . Good . Because if you 're not , I pick one person and I put them out in the rain . These are your own people . My people ? My people are rats leaving a sinking ship . Seventh-genners get a pretty little farm on Leith . I 'm fourth generation . I have to make my own way off of this rock . And I 'll cancel anyone who tries to stop me . You 're going to cut and run . Come on . This is crap , man ! ( GROANS ) WOMAN : ( GASPING ) on , God . Starting with this loudmouth . That 's right . You 're all my insurance . So , I really hope he likes you enough to come back . I pray you know what you 're doing , Killjoy . JOHN : What 's your biggest regret right now ? Being stupid about D 'avin . ( CHIMES ) I usually know better . Shouldn 't have slept with someone I care about . D 'avin , what 's your greatest fear ? Not knowing what 's next . ( BUZZES ) The next warrant is what 's next . And the warrant after that . That 's what got me through when I was first on the run from Khlyen . Take it day by day , warrant by warrant . And one day , you 've ... ( CLICKS TONGUE ) You 've moved on . To what ? That 's up to you . ( SIGHS ) ( CHUCKLES ) All my life , all I ever wanted to be was a hero . Probably because I never had the bones to stand up to our shitty dad . So , I got a uniform and a weapon and I learned how to kill bad guys . Except one day , I wake up and I find out ... I 'm not a hero . lam the bad guy . ( SCOFFS ) My biggest fear is that I 'll never be good enough . ( CHIMES ) Atta go , team . You 're almost on your way . Just one final question . Dutch , do you trust D 'avin ? JOHN : So , you really grew up down here . ALVIS : Yep , that 's me . Alvis the Penitent , born of rats . Fitting . ALVIS : Which part of me offends you , Jaqobis ? You give people false hope . You don 't respect faith . Oh , I 'd respect you if you actually believed what you were selling . But you use religion to play politics . You can believe in more than one thing at once . I believe in a free Westerley . ( LAUGHS ) Well , good luck with that . Might as well believe in monsters and Level 6 Killjoys . The Company owns Westerley , Alvis . And they are not letting go . ALVIS : Neither are we . Enjoy your tug of war , then . But I prefer fixating on things that can be , you know , fixed . I 've noticed . And who nominated you to fix them all , Jaqobis ? What 's that supposed to mean , " Who nominated " ? Alvis , what brings you ? Twick , we have a friend in need of some bliss . Jakk ? Oh , man . It 's tight out there , Alvis . Supply just about dried up . We don 't need much , just one hit . Is this one of your pet Killjoys ? A Pet ? The meet-up had a hitch . What meet-up ? He 's helping to set things right . We need the Jakk . One hit . For the cause . Thanks . It 's my last one . The gods love sacrifice . Let me repay you with a blessing . And the roots grew from the mother tree to connect us all . ALL : And the roots grew . And the roots grew . And the roots grew . Please , Uncle , a blessing ? ALVIS : My pain , your redemption . My suffering , your salvation . ALL : And the roots grew . JOHN : Those people back there . They all Resistance ? ALVIS : One out of every 10 down here . Eager for independence . Looking to die for a cause . Like you . JOHN : Me ? You don 't have to go back to the bar . You could save yourself . But here you are . That 's just basic humanity . ALVIS : Not much place for that on Westerley . Makes you either a masochist or a martyr . And an odd choice for a Killjoy . Honestly , I just wanted to build spaceships , but life had other plans . Well , D 'avin had other plans , and I accommodated . Do that a lot , huh ? Lucky for him , you 're so good at cleaning up after everyone . SERGEANT : Hold ! Where are you heading ? JOHN : The Royale . SERGEANT : Oh , really ? Looks like we got here one monk and one ... Reclamation Agent . No shit . Well , I got a man upstairs with an emergency beacon ringing loud and clear . You 're going to want to stay down here . An extraction team is on the way . JOHN : Wait , if they see uniforms , they 'll start killing hostages . Not your warrant , not your problem . JOHN : I gave my word . Let me go in there for you . I have a better shot at ending this without any more bloodshed . He 's really good at fixing things . SERGEANT : Okay , Killjoy . You bring us the crew , the claims and our guy alive . It 's on you now . Thirty minutes or we storm the place . ALVIS : How are you going to deliver all that ? JOHN : Quickly . ( SIGHS ) What 's wrong ? It 's dirty . No . Well , can you do the surgery without it ? We don 't have a choice . Make sure I get through this ? Like I said , I owe you . ( SIGHS HEAVILY ) Let 's save this asshole . ( EXHALES ) Yes , I trust D 'avin . ( BUZZING ) No , I absolutely do not trust D 'avin . ( BUZZING ) ( SIGHS ) It must be broken . We 're never going to get Lucy started again . I get it . It bothers you . You can 't be completely sure that someone can 't ... Switch me on again . D 'avin , talking about it doesn 't help . I need to ... Feel it . Okay , then , let 's get you there . Let 's go back . How did you become a Killjoy ? After you ran away from Khlyen . I , um ... I learned three specialties from my harem . Killing , dancing and marrying into royalty . And the last two weren 't hiring . ( CHUCKLES ) I bet you were a great dancer . It 's the one part I still miss . Well , come on , you have a captive audience of one . No way . No chance . No . Come on , Dutch . Absolutely not . Feel something . At least trust me enough for this . You first . Impress me . ( CHUCKLES ) Okay , um ... The service did teach us one dance for formal occasions . But it requires a partner . Cheater . Lucy , if you please . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) I can 't . Shit . Dutch . You need to stop being so polite . Yell at me . It 's okay to be angry , to hate me , it 's normal . Normal won 't work here . That 's why I 'm angry . If anyone ... If the real you hurt me or Johnny , I know exactly what to do . I 'd kill you , I 'd mourn you , and I 'd move on . But this is so much messier than that . You 're as much a victim as we are , D 'avin . So , I don 't get to hurt you . I don 't get to hate you . And I don 't know how to move on . PAWTER : Suction . Suction . Avoiding the phrenic nerve . Careful . What did I hit ? He 's crashing . No , no , no . Look , he 's fine . He 's not . You 're doing great . I ... I don 't ... I 'm hearing things . This was a mistake . I can 't do this . No , no , no . Hey , hey . You can do this . No . Last time I did this , I killed my patient . ( CHUCKLES ) Okay , look , you 're feeling paranoid . No . Back on Qresh , I operated high once . And I killed him . I should have gone to jail . I should have lost my license . But my family hushed it up and I was shipped here instead . That 's why I work out of the back of a bar , John . I 'm not some do-gooder . I 'm a failure with rich parents . And Mommy and Daddy keep you supplied in pure Jakk . Hey . Hey . Illenore Pawter Simms . You 're going through a bad high . But this guy , he needs you . And junkie or not , you are the best doctor on this shitty moon . It 's a pretty low bar . It is a pretty low bar . And I 'm down there with you . Depending on you like all those people downstairs . Now , fix him . What is this ? Lucy , projection . DUTCH : Lovely . A giant picture of you . No , that 's not me . That 's bad D 'avin . What am I supposed to do with him ? Hate him . Hurt him . Move on . You first . You can 't avoid knives forever . Why , they going to stop making guns ? I 'm being serious . I 'm not the only one you hurt . You won 't even talk about stabbing John . Come on , soldier boy . You just going to stand there , or are you going to kill something ? Okay , I get it . You want me to face my demons . So , face them . Hit the target . He 's right behind me . Dutch , this isn 't funny . We can 't be a team unless you trust yourself again . If there 's a warrant on my ass and you 've got the shot , I need to know you can take the shot . If Khlyen is behind me , I need to know you can take the shot . Take the shot . Fine . ( EXHALES ) Wait ! Don 't . Don 't . I 'm sorry . Don 't be . It 's okay . I think we just got our answer . You don 't trust me . I 'll tell John . ( BEEPING ) LUCY : Warning . We seem to be caught in the rain 's magnetic flux . Which means ? We are being pulled into the event itself . Calculating our orbital decay . Orbital decay ? We 're being pulled into the storm . It 's done . He 's alive . Finally , some good news . Can he move ? She 's closing him up now . Says he 'll be good to go when the rain stops . But he won 't be walking . Then how the hell are we supposed to get to our ship ? I 'm working on it . Can I have two minutes to catch my breath ? I don 't care about your breathing . So figure out something or I put this guy down right now ! What is that ? Who are you talking to ? The Company . And there 's a squad waiting to end you if you touch a hair on me or any of these people . Company don 't give a shit about Westies , but they 'll care about you , won 't they ? Open the door ! No , no , no . You don 't want to do this . Move ! JOHN : Don 't do it . We 'll work something out . ( SCREAMING ) SURJA : Crawl , Company dog . Your people made the rain . Let 's see how you like it now . Now , unless you want somebody else going out there , give me a plan on how to get out of here . He was the plan , you idiot . SURJA : Where are you going ? Hey ! HECTOR : Man , get back inside . What are you , crazy ? JOHN : Little bit . But I didn 't come out just for you . I do not trust D 'avin . If he was the last man in the universe , I wouldn 't trust him . ( BUZZING ) LUCY : Our proximity to the storm is interfering with the device . Its components are finely ... Shut up . Lucy , you have to start the engines . The device won 't let me . Okay , override it . [ cannot Storm impact in 30 seconds . What if it just stops ? Why the hell not ? Thank you . Engines online . - I 'm on drive . - l 'm on guidance . Jaqobis ! Like I said , masochist or martyr . I just need to pick something up . He 'll live . Alvis ? Black rain scars . The brothers will be jealous . Okay , we got him . How do we use him ? Don 't know , don 't care . We got movement down here ! The Company . Get everyone up ! We 'll use them as human shields ! Move ! Move ! Now , what are you doing ? You need to fix this ! In the last 10 days , I 've been attacked by face-hugging biotech , stabbed by my brother , had major surgery , helped perform major surgery , been beaten , bullied and burned . lam done fixing things . You said you had a plan . Oh , I have a plan . But you wouldn 't like it . Pree . You better let The Company in before they blast through your floor . Hold your fire down there ! I 'm opening up ! Thanks for patching me up . Again . You 're coming down pretty hard . You 're going to get the chills . You 're good at this . Who was the addict ? You 're not the first woman I 've had to score drugs for . Go home , Johnny . Doctor 's orders . You 're ready . ALVIS : You still question my faith ? JOHN : Well , your sanity , maybe . Uncle . Please . May I have your blessing ? Well , this meet-up was certainly more eventful than we planned . Lot of trouble to go through to deliver a message . What do you have for me ? We 're stockpiling weapons and troops all across Old Town . We 're prepping for something big . But they haven 't told us what . But it 's coming . Specs on all the storage depots . And even better , blueprints . For the bunkers . I 'll pray for your quick recovery . You were right , John . We 're broken . But now we know . And we want to figure out what 's next . So , until then , I 'm off the ship . Consolation prize ? Issue 41 . John , I 'm sorry I hurt you . So you bought me a comic ? It 's Captain Apex . The one I ... I lost . You bought me a comic to apologize for stabbing me . No . No , John , look . I ... I know I 've messed up in so many different ways . No , you have no idea where you even began to mess up . Okay . I didn 't talk to you for nine years . And ? And I left you to deal with the crap of Mom and Dad alone . Yeah . Okay , thanks for playing , but you failed to provide a complete answer . How about what it cost me ? Taking care of Mom , I couldn 't go away to school . Taking care of Dad 's debts . I can never , ever go home . And then what ? You slept with the one person that I asked you not to . And what did that cost me , huh ? Our team ... I get it . D 'av . I wrecked everything in your life . Just tell me how to make it better . No , I am done . lam done cleaning up for you . You want to fix this ? Then you figure it out . ( BEEPING ) Come in . Can 't sleep . Long day ? Shit weather . Hmm . Don 't be mad I couldn 't make it work . I 'm mad that you 'd even think that I 'd be mad . Bedtime story ? Why not ? " After valiantly dispatching the Admiral 's hordes , " Captain Apex received a distress call from the Velubian Princess . " Oh , she 's quite Velubian . I see why you like this . Shh ! Come on . ( CLEARING THROAT ) " As we return to our heroes , they are once again trapped on Laguna 37 . " Suddenly ... " Captain Apex , watch out ! " I 'll handle this , Your Highness . " Meanwhile , in a galaxy far , far away , unimaginable evil was quietly afoot . "

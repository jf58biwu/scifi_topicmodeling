 Hello . - Hello . Well , go on . Thank you . It 's a machine I 'm building to stop that car . But it 's not finished yet . You 'll have to wait a bit longer . SUM OF HISTORIES Hi Tom . Welcome to THE GAME . Go to the Cow Drop tomorrow . Buy box 46 . Lena . And : P.S. Club Brugge will beat Anderlecht 3-0 . De Sutter will score in minute four . 14 days earlier Read me the e-mail . Okay . - Look , another fat car . Here : Hi Tom . Welcome to THE GAME . Go to the Cow Drop tomorrow . Buy box 46 . Signed Lena . - That 's spam . And : P.S. Club Brugge will beat Anderlecht 3-0 . Then it 's not spam . De Sutter will score in minute four . That 's our Tom . Hey , you . It 's another fatso . Do they get a discount or something ? Hey . Come on . Okay . Wait . - Dammit , man . Wait . - Stop it . Come on . Now . You can 't be serious . Dammit . A new attack from Club ... A good pass . De Sutter at the second post . And he scores . Only four minutes and it 's 1-0 . De Sutter scores . Anderlecht is behind . Cow Drop Excuse me . - Yes ? May I ask ... - Yes . I 'm looking for Lena . - You 're in the right place . Are you Lena ? Me ? No . Lena is there , by the fence . In the white dress with brown spots . Okay . Thanks . Say hi for me . - I will . Thank you . Here . Good luck . - Thanks . Hello . Box fifteen , please . - Hey . Yes . There you go . Fifteen . Here . Good luck . - Thanks . Bye . Hello . Hello . And ? Did you talk to Lena ? Yes , yes . We had a deep conversation . And she even let it slip that it 's box 46 . And I told her not to tell . Yes , but I promised her dinner . Something intimate , just the two of us . Wow . Forty-six . There you go . Good luck . - Thanks . If you feel like it , you can come with us . The more the merrier . Will we eat steak ? - Of course . And we 're off , folks . - Thanks . Watch out , folks . All eyes on Lena . Lena doesn 't really feel like it . R 's calm right now . She looks fantastic . And Lena knows it . Come on . Come on , Lena . Oh . Lena 's got her tail up . - Yes . What 's happening ? Yes , yes . Bingo . Number forty-five wins . Number forty-five . I think . - I don 't think so . It 's up to the Chair . Come on , Eddy . The result is in dispute , folks . Forty-six . - Forty-six wins . Who has forty-six ? To the young man with ... Here he is . The cow whisperer . I knew it . Oh , yes . Of course . She told you . No . Someone , a certain Lena , sent me an e-mail with the tip : box forty-six . So , Lena 's part of a conspiracy . Yes . Yes . So it seems . Yes . No . - Yes . Fuck . - Fuck for sure . Did you reply yet ? - No , it 's anonymous . typical . Sorry . Sorry I 'm late . - It 's okay . How are you ? - Great . All right . Take your time . We 're still doing dishes . Well , it 's something like that . - Wow . Well , this is it . Do you feel like coffee ? Upstairs ? No , thanks . - Or tea ? Warm milk ? Fristi ? Or a foot massage ? Or a weekend in Bruges ? Or Paris ? Or Thailand ? Two . A foot massage ? You should just take her . Here on the desk . Perv , get your stinky feet off my desk . She works at the uni . Griefs a final year ... - No , Lena . The e-mail she sent had a 134 IP address . That 's the university . I think she sent a hundred e-mails , one per box . Yes , but De Sutter 's goal in minute four . That 's uncanny . Yes ... Bribery ? Look . It 's an e-mail from Lena . Hi Tom , the game continues . Go to Schapenstraat 127 . Buy a pane of glass by Karen Vermeren . Bury it tomorrow ... - ... wrapped , in the center of the linden tree circle at the castle . Lena . - Lena . A pane of glass ? How much would that cost ? You 're not going to do it . That 's ... special . Actually , who told you that I paint ? - Lena . Lena ? - Yes . I don 't know any Lena . - No ? That makes two of us , then . And this one ? One hundred euros ? Okay . Sold . - All right . Super . Is that deep enough ? Yes . Put it all in . This is boring . Have a bit more to drink , then . What 's that by your eye ? There . - Did I get it ? One eye . Close your eyes . Hello . - Did you guys have sex ? Have sex ? No . Then what 's that ? It 's my bra . A bra is for having sex . What did you bury yesterday ? A pane of glass . Don 't you two have to go to school ? Go on then . Go . Didn 't we have sex ? No . Thanks . Listen . She 's snoring . Make sure you 're there , later . - Yes . Okay . What 's happening later ? Nothing . Okay . We 're through . It 's a pity , the sex wasn 't bad . Do you have your mama 's phone number ? Are you okay ? - I 'm okay . Are you sure ? - Yes , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . All right . Okay . Helmets on . - Yes . Okay . Wait ... Ready ? - Yes . Come on . Eight . - Okay . Come on , guys . - Yes , nine . Yes . Attention : Biker - Guys , a biker . Wait , wait , wait . Dimi ? Can we start again ? Coast is clear . - Okay . Guys , hey . Come on . Focus . Ooh . That 's high . Is it hanging okay ? - Yes . Alright . Move on ! Right . - It won 't work . How so ? - Push it . Is that the right button ? - No . What was that ? - I don 't know . What was that ? Go up . Go up . Push it ... - Push that button . Push the button . Hey . - I can 't ... Grab the cable . Grab the cable . I can 't hold on . Don 't let go . - I can 't keep it up . I can 't . Oh no . Come on , Viktor . And hold on to it tight . Tie your shoelace , son . 25 years later The time . It 's not moving . Time is almost standing still . Jesus . It 's going to turn back . Negative time ? But then ... Then ... - We can send something back . Yes , an e-mail or something . Yes . Maybe . Do you really think ... I have a class to teach . Back it up immediately . Lorentz factor times time , minus vx , divided by the speed of light , squared . So , time is relative . Maybe too relative for some of us . Time depends , in part , on the velocity . Faster motion means ... Slower time ? - Yes . In ' 71 , in the last century , two men , Haida and Keafing , showed this in a simple , fantastic experiment . Two airplanes carried atomic clocks , synchronized at departure . They flew away from each other . Excuse me . Pardon me . Pardon . This is Titus Dekeyser , a top PhD student . There 's a small problem with the test run . We 'll discuss the Hafele-Keating experiment in our next class . It 's going backwards . That 's not possible . That 's not possible . - The electrode interval dictates Casimir 's effect and thus the size of the wormhole . Go get the lock-in amplifier from Luc . Are we going to test it ? Okay . We 'll just run a quick test . Come in . - Sorry . We just finished . - Hey . Congratulations . - Thank you . Sorry . - Everything looks good . Your baby is five centimetres now . The heartbeat is excellent . - Well , five centimetres . Doctor , may I ... - Yes . Thank you . Well . Thanks . - You 're welcome . Bye ! See you next time . - Yes . Thank you . Mom . - Yes , Dad ? Celebrate ? Well , we have problems with a test run , so ... Okay . You two go ahead and celebrate . Okay . Okay . Okay . Almost . Stop . Negative 27 hours . Ready ? So , to Lotte ? lotte @ esat.kul.be Ask her to stack five sugar cubes under a cup . Hello Lotte . Could you quickly come stack five sugar cubes under the ... Hawking cup in the lab ? She can 't tell us about it . This is a kind of experiment . You may not talk to us about it in any way . Thanks . Kisses . Titus . Kisses ? Send ? Yes . Now we can ... The Twin Towers . The tsunami . - Burj Khalifa . One e-mail , man . Clinton 's murder . The crash of ' 25 . - We 're God . We could rig the lottery . - No , we can 't . Or Anna . - Anna ? My first love . I shouldn 't have dumped her . I 'll e-mail myself . No , we can 't . We can 't do that . What 's going on ? Nothing , Professor . Forget it , Theo . We 're off to bed . Yes , it 's bedtime . We 'll give it a rest for a bit . Theo . - What a face he made . Titus , Titus . Not a word . Really , don 't tell a soul . Just act normal . - Right . How am I supposed to act normal ? So , really , shh . Lena ? Lena ? Oh , sweetheart . Hey - Hey - Come here . Oh , honey . I want ... What ? - I want he ... What did you say ? - I ... want ... heated floors . Heated floors ? - Yes . Oh , honey . Three Student Activists Dead May 11 , 2015 Saturday night , three students ... Did you sleep well ? - Not bad . Did you see the sign about the Vermeren retrospective ? I was thinking : What if we have someone bury an early Vermeren ? That doesn 't seem dangerous to me . - No ? We 'll hang it up here . They 're pretty . Hey ... And it wouldn 't hurt our pensions , either . Maybe we should e-mail them . They 're students who died in a stunt . - Died ? An e-mail just before they die can 't alter their lives much . It minimizes changes to the past and won 't likely alter our own lives . Right . You don 't want to change your own past . No . We must avoid that for sure . About Anna ... I 'm over that . She had such tiny breasts . Hey . That 's perfect . It 's almost 25 years ago . Vermeren would give that glass away for a song , I think . Are we going to do it tonight ? Okay . Will you do Casimir ? We need a photo for the book . - Is there a title yet ? The Wheelchair in My Backpack . No comments . It will be a bestseller . Folks , today Professor Vandersypen will be replaced by his humble assistant . And , because he is such a big fan of the wondrous , fantastic , unforgettable , divine , blessed , delicious , gorgeous ... Anyone else ? Lovely ? - Lovely . Perfect . Horny ? - Better yet . Horny . Folks , may I have a round of applause for the incredibly horny Casimir effect ! Electrons that can go back in time : Who would have thought ? Soon , we 'll be able to send e-mails to the past . Where do you want us ? - Let 's try there , in the light . That will be pretty . And hold still . Super . Super . One more . One more . Nice . Very nice . Yes . Fantastic . - Yes . So sweet . I want to be close to you . - Go ahead . No , no , no . Patience ... It 's a game called Cow Drop box . First , we 'll send him the winning box . Then he 'll have enough money to buy the Vermeren . Okay . - I signed the e-mail Lena . Why Lena ? - The cow 's called Lena . Do you have an e-mail address ? - Yes . This one 's . Send ? Yes . What now ? Dig a hole , I guess ? - Yes . What ? Well . Okay , nothing . Good . There 's something here . Come on . Here 's something . Yes . Yes . Yes . Yes . Yes . - Be careful . That 's a real Vermeren . Shh , Titus . It 's just ... It 's a real one . I have a really good idea for a second experiment . We can ... We have to call it off , Titus . - Call it off ? We never know what chain reactions we might cause . But , Viktor . We can 't just ... We can publish everything but the Casimir effect . Saturday we 'll put an end to it . But , Viktor . We can save thousands or even millions of lives . Even aside from what this means to science , and to us . This is the discovery of ... - Why ? To become more famous ? - More famous ? World famous . - Okay , okay . Maybe life would be better . But we 've already got it good . We 're at the top of the world , man . You have Emma . I have ... I have ... Lena is pregnant . Really ? You don 't say . But ... But ... Congratulations . How far along is she ? - Twelve weeks . It 's too dangerous , Titus . You may keep the Vermeren . But this ends here . Titus . Hey ... Fuck . - Titus . Titus . It 's over . Girl Run Over in Heverlee May 11 , 2015 ' ? May 11 , 2015 . Theo . - Yes ? How long have you worked here ? 51 years . - 51 years ? Yes , but don 't tell . - No , no . I hope you can muster up the patience , Theo . You would be doing me a big favor . Thanks in advance . Best regards , your friend . Can you see them , honey ? - Yes . Absolutely . Do you want a quick drink ? - Yes . Another cola ? - No . Not cola . I want beer . I know , honey . In six months . - Six months ? And breastfeeding ? I can 't breastfeed a baby . Don 't run away . You don 't feel it . - What ? You don 't feel that . Hey . Viktor . - Hey . Viktor . Are you okay , honey ? I want water . - What ? Water . It 's okay . - Okay . Thanks . Listen . She 's snoring . Make sure you 're there , later . - Yes . Dimi , Dimi , Dimi . An e-mail from Lena . Hi Tom . This is your last task . Be at Arenberg Castle at 18 : 30 on the dot and stop the gray car . Lena . That 's Arenberg Castle , isn 't it ? Stop the gray car ? Maybe Lena 's in it . Is this one gray or white ? It 's white . Not quite half past . There . That one . Yes , that 's the one . Go . - Okay . Okay . Stop , stop , stop . Stop . Wait . - Stop . Grief ! Grief ! ? No . Get an ambulance to Arenberg Castle , okay ? Griet ? Here . - Hello ? An ambulance . Arenberg Castle . Lena Degrade . Dammit . And ? Fuck it . Okay . Eight . Yes , nine . No . 25 years later Professor ? Come in . Have a seat . Are you doing okay ? - Yes , yes . I 've thought about this a lot . This ? - Yes , this conversation . And this conversation is about " ? - Something very odd . Almost magical . I have to bring this to you . What 's on it ? A file that was sent to me a while ago to deliver to you only now , today . And what is a while ago ? Twenty-five years , three months and two days . Twenty-five years ago . I was two then . Yes . Yes , I know . I know . Oh yes . The password should be the name of your first love . Anna . Dear Titus , I hope that you remember writing this four days ago . If not , that 's bad . It means Viktor Vandersypen went ahead And sent an e-mail to the past to help his darling Lena . This e-mail must have had a big impact on his past and your own . You 'd worked with him for four years . Together , you discovered a way to send e-mails to the past . All the details are in this e-mail . In the attached map , you 'll find the spot where you buried a pane of glass by Vermeren . Was she your girlfriend ? What was her name ? Griet . I wanted to thank her . She kept me out of the street . Did you send those e-mails ? E-mails ? No , silly . Come on , Viktor . Come on . Come on , Viktor . Faster . Are you coming early on Sunday ? I could use the help . Louise will be there . - Louise ? Yes . You 'll see . A bit further ? - No . Professor . I have a question for you . I 'm Titus Dekeyser . I study quantum computing . How do you do . - I 'm doing an experiment . Could you help with a technical problem ? - Now ? No . When it 's convenient for you . In which lab ? It 's set up in the castle cellar , but the experiments not part of my PhD . Tomorrow morning ? I 'll try to stop by before class . That would be great . Thank you . Professor . So this isn 't part of your PhD ? - Right . A side project . Do you know of Luke Butcher ? He was the first to suggest sending a ray of light back in time . In theory . No . In practice . No . A wormhole would never stay stable for long . It would if you use negative energy density through the Casimir effect . Casimir ? And ? Does it work ? I 've come very close . I already succeeded in coding a ray of light . So we could send information back in time , like e-mails . E-mails . - Yes . E-mails . You want to send e-mails back in time ? - Yes , I do . But that 's ... How is that ... That 's imp ... You can 't ... You need a quantum specialist . Or a secretary . They like to e-mail . Professor , I 'm convinced that you can help me . You have an Einstein . I got it from Professor ... - Nakamura . I know him . I was his intern . Did you go to his house ? - No . I have the Hawking . The Hawking . Well . He has a huge studio . He makes fantastic things . What did you say about Casimir ? - Well . Using Casimir , we can keep the wormhole stable . By using negative energy density ... Why do you sleep here ? Because I 'm waiting . For Lena . For me ? - No . For another Lena . Did that Lena kick you out ? No . I 'm just waiting for her . When is she coming , then ? I don 't know . I wouldn 't do that . Queen . They 're advertising a Vermeren retrospective . Yes , I know . Know what her early pieces go for now ? - No . TOO , ODD . I dug that up way too soon . - You did . 100,000 , Tom . That would have helped you plant a few extra trees . Check . Viktor . You have to see this . - It 's pointless . Give me two seconds . - Titus . I think that we 're missing something . - It 's not possible . And I know it is possible , dammit . Titus . Your enthusiasm is impressive , and I know it will get you far , but ... Take it from me : This specific experiment ... It 's a waste of time . Apparently , you and I sent e-mails back to the past together . We sent e-mails to a student . And we asked him to bury a Vermeren . Tom buried a Vermeren . - Yes , Tom . And he was supposed to die , but he lived . Apparently , that changed everything . And you . You and Lena were together . Look , Viktor . This is your handwriting . Lena . Lena and I were together ? Yes . And she was pregnant with your baby . We can do this . No , even better . We 've already done this . Here . They 're out of Grills . I got Bugles . Dimi . Dimi , look . First the ball . Then the car . So Lena would surely have been hit . I don 't know how , but she 's involved in this . Well . - She is . This is the last time , you know , Tom . - Yes . Thanks . See that you 're there tomorrow . I 'll see . - Be at the church at ten o 'clock . Or not . Dammit , man . She 's dead . Even Lena can 't change that . But it 's Lena 's fault that Griet is dead , Dimi . So ? What will you do if she comes ? Will hitting her help ? Her e-mails kept you off that roof . You got a fucking second chance . Do something with it . Zonne . Wait . Stop . Come here . Yes . Yes , that 's good . Don 't you have a coat ? Is this okay ? Yes . - Yes . Have you got the keys ? - Yes . We 'll go by foot . - What ? Oh ? Yes . - Okay . Yes . Five more minutes . One Dead Following Truck Driver 's Heart Attack Dear Tom . It 's time for us to meet . Meet me at the bus stop on Pieter Nollekenstraat at 11 : 10 . Well ? Answer it . No . But maybe it 's Lena . Go on . Hello ? Do you know what I think ? That someone 's protecting you . That there 's someone looking out for you . That someone loves you very much . Very much . That 's what I think . Will you come back ? No . It 's better if I leave . For everyone . Lena . 25 years later I have to bring this to you . What 's on it ? A file that was sent to me a while ago to deliver to you only now , today . If it 's before seven , I 'm at work . If not , I 'm worn out from all that work . Leave a message ... Hey , busy bee . I 'll pick you up tonight at eight . And put on grubby clothes . We 're going to dig a hole . I just arrived . I 'll take a quick shower . - Yes , yes . Grubby clothes , then ? - Yes , yes . Okay . That guy that slept in the park ? He buried a pane of glass back then . - Yes . And you think it was a real Vermeren ? I hope so . Her earliest works are worth a fortune now . A real Vermeren ? How exciting . Someone 's there . - What ? He 's digging . Lena . Lena . Stay here . No , no . No , no . Viktor . May I ask what you 're doing ? Professor Vandersypen . Who are you ? I 'm Titus Dekeyser . I work at Esat . I thought ... You sent yourself an e-mail , too ? What do you mean ? Well , to your past self . An e-mail to my past self ? You 're ... You 're Lena . Yes . You were an item then , too . I have a photo of it . An item ? Us ? And ... Just when was ' then ' ? So ... I 'll see you tomorrow . Is it possible ? He mentioned the Casimir effect . It 's very farfetched . But ... Kiss me . I won 't ask again . Well . He 's pulling our chain . We were in Nature four times . In Science three times . We were a fantastic team . And we can be one again now . We sent that guy two e-mails . One to get him some money and one to have him buy and bury the pane of glass . That photo ... The photo seems real . - It is real . See ? She was pregnant . Patient : Lena Degroote . Partner : Viktor Vandersypen . Dated last week . Last week ? Well , in ... In your previous life , it was . - But why ... Why aren 't Lena and I together now ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Because you were famous ? No way . - I don 't know . Wait , wait , wait . I think your experiment is truly ingenious . I 'd really love to invent great things with you , but ... This is ... Sorry , but it 's totally ... I can 't be a part of this . I 'm sorry . I noticed your cup . Nakamura ? I have a Hawking . If you claim to know Nakamura at all , you know I wouldn 't have been his intern if he didn 't love my work . You must have e-mailed that guy a third time to stop that car . And you didn 't just change your life . You ruined my career , too . Car ? What car ? - The car that would have hit Lena and put her in a wheelchair . Lena was in a wheelchair ? Imagine if we could determine , for certain , that our electron , Lisa , is in the front row , seventh seat . Then , according to Heisenberg , I can 't determine her momentum . There 's a nest of young falcons . I visit them every day . Good afternoon . Can I help you ? My name is Viktor . I was very young- - And you were sleeping in the park . By the castle . Little Viktor . Hey . Come in . And that 's where I stopped . All by boat ? Boat , bus , train , hitchhiking ... It took me almost two years . Just this forest , here . I didn 't go there . That was too dangerous . Would you like a drink ? - Sure . A beer ? Cheers . - Yes , cheers . Well . It 's been a long time . Yes , it has . This morning , a doctoral student dropped by . He claims ... He claims and can prove ... that we apparently built a machine together , which can send e-mails back ... in time . Apparently , we sent the e-mails to you . Including an e-mail ... about a pane of glass . The pane of glass that you buried back then . So it was you . Lena 's brainy little friend . So you sent the e-mails ? - Yes . Yes . Apparently so . For her sake ? For Lena . Yes . We were married . She was in a wheelchair . She was hit by a car when she was small . The car that you then headed off . Why me ? Well ... We wanted to avoid making too many changes to the past , so we looked for someone who would die shortly afterward . But it didn 't work out that way . So I should have died anyway . What ? I don 't understand . The fourth e-mail . Meet me at the bus stop . It was meant for me . I don 't know anything about that . Why would I want you dead ? I don 't know . I know absolutely nothing about that . Maybe it 's already the third or fourth new reality . Maybe a lot more e-mails were sent . But I 'll set it right . I can fix it . - Fix what ? I can send you another e-mail . No , don 't . An e-mail to warn you . No , you 're not sending me anything . If you are who you claim to be , you 're not sending me anything . Each thing you 've done has gone wrong . You wanted to save your Lena . But then my girlfriend , Griet , died . And my best friend . Dimi . He ended up under a truck . Instead of me . So you 're not sending me anything else . Not a thing . I 'm sorry . I thought ... Maybe ... I 've always had the feeling that I had to live for both of us , that I also had to make Dimi 's life mean something . I 've made my peace with it . So please don 't change anything . Please . And how is Lena now ? Is she happy with her new legs ? I think so . Do the two of you have lovely children ? We ... We don 't have any . We 're not together . Lena 's still looking for the one . I think . What about you ? You gave her a new life . You did everything for Lena . I don 't think we ... Lena is ... We don 't belong together . Viktor . Does Lena know about the wheelchair ? She doesn 't know anything . Not a thing . Lena ? - Viktor ? Hey . - Hey . Hello . - I 'll try again . But ... What ? I might have tried this a thousand times before . Or someone like me . Or exactly the same , but ... We are possible . Lena . The guy from last night , Titus , was right . Lena , somewhere , in a parallel universe , we 're together . Viktor ... - You won 't believe me . But I have evidence ... Look . Titus took photos of that other reality . This is the machine I invented to change the past . Remember , that time with that car in the park ... Normally , you 'd have been hit and paralyzed . You were in a wheelchair , and we were together . See how happy you look ? You were pregnant . Lena . And then , stupid me , I sent an e-mail to Tom to fend off the car . So you 're not in a wheelchair anymore . And now ... Lena . Because you 're so pretty and so sweet and so ... smart and so sexy and so wheelchair-free , you have it all , and you can 't see me right here . I 've been in love with you forever . Because Tom is ... Tom has ... - Who 's Tom ? Tom , the guy from the park . Tom thinks he must live enough for two . I 'm just now getting that feeling . I feel I 'm just starting to live . I could live a thousand lives ' worth . After you kick me out , as you most likely will , I will still love you . I 've always loved you . Lena . That is , without a doubt , the most beautiful sweetest most absurd speech ever . May I say something more ? - Of course . I don 't want to say any more . Okay . What now ? I have no idea . So ... It seems to me that it 's a great time to kiss . Okay . You 're my sweetest best friend . My best friend . Are you going to kick me out now ? No , you can stay . But it might ... I have a date with someone . Show me the door , then . - Okay . Viktor ? Are you okay ? Dear Tom ... Am I getting another e-mail ? It 's from Lena Dear Tom . Forget the previous e-mail . Don 't stop the car . Don 't stop the car ? She wanted us out of the way . She 's digging it up . Will you stay ? - Yes , okay . Stop - Stop - No . Come on . Pick up , pick up , pick up . Come on , Lena . Yes , yes . And hold on to it this time . - Yes , yes . Hello , Viktor . - Hello . This is a gift . And this is the wheelchair bike that I 'm going to make for us . Nice . That way , I can bike you to school . You know ... You saved me . So I have to take good care of you . 25 years later ...

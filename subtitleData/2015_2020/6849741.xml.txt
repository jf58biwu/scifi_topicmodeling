 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Agent Johnson saved us all . - Just go with it . You 'll thank me later . - Coulson : Let 's start with the secret plan you cut with Senator Nadeer . Daisy : Did you know she has an Inhuman prisoner locked away ? I 'm from S.H.I.E.L.D. [ Cracking ] I have friends who have also gone through this . - It 's nice to meet you , Jemma . - What 's your name ? - Aah ! Aah ! - Thank you , Doctor . - I think we 're finished here . - May : If you won 't read it , I will . Radcliffe : It 's too much for a human mind to bear . Perhaps I could read the book . [ Music ] Fitz : Everybody is trying to do their best to prevent another tragedy like Lincoln . But we built Aida to protect agents like him . I can 't figure you out . We flirt , we talk on the phone , we go to dinner , and then nothing . I 've asked Agent Nathanson to accompany Aida back to your lab . Oh , my God . What the ... [ Bones crack ] [ Grunts ] My apologies , Agent May . I 'll have you cleaned up in no time . Radcliffe : Not just a robot . It 's one that can pass for a human . There 's nothing I 'd rather be doing , no place I 'd rather be . - You ? - I 'm right where I belong . 4x09 - " Broken Promises " [ Slow music plays ] [ May groans ] I 'll play you music when I can . Studies show that listening to music increases dopamine levels by 9 % . And I 'll arrange for more comfortable accommodations eventually . But I must keep you hidden a secret until your substitute has served her purpose . So , unfortunately you 'll have to stay here for now . [ Dramatic music ] Mace : Due to recent events , S.H.I.E.L.D. is on high alert . This is a serious threat we 're facing , which is why I 've assembled you all here today . It is absolutely critical that we safely dispose of the Darkhold . - Phil . - Once the Zephyr 's ready , Agents May and Mackenzie will accompany me . We 'll transfer the Darkhold to an agent who specializes in making items like this disappear . How 's he going to manage that ... some sort of magic spell ? [ Music ] Right , yeah , probably had your fill of dark-arts jokes , what with the flame-headed demon and all of that . While we 're handling the book , your mission is to accompany Dr. Radcliffe and erase Aida 's hard drive . - What ? - I 'm not ... I 'm not sure ... Aida read the Darkhold . Coulson : We can 't risk having any of its contents in her memory . - It 's too dangerous . - Makes sense , although does seem a little bit unfair to Aida , considering how many lives she just saved . Okay . First of all , that thing is not a " she " ... it 's a damn robot . And second of all , what 's the matter with you two chuckleheads ? Have either one of you seen a movie in the last 30 years ? The robots always attack . Well , technically speaking , Aida 's not a robot ... - she 's an android . - That 's true . Android , robot ... it doesn 't matter what you call ' em . The end result 's always the same ... they rise up against their human overlords and go kill crazy . You make a fair , if somewhat intense , point . Yeah . Yeah , I don 't see any harm in replacing her hard drive . Better safe than sorry , as they say . So happy you agree , 'cause it 's also an order . Now get to work . [ Footsteps depart ] [ Music box playing " Happy Birthday " ] [ Music ] [ Doors creak ] [ Knife slicing ] - Ellen . - Glad you finally woke up . Looked like you were having bad dreams . It was about Mom 's birthday , when the Chitauri attacked . Worst day of my life . [ Music ] Though finding you in that cocoon seven months ago - was a close second . - Seven months ? I was gone that long ? [ Music ] What is this , Ellen ? Why are we here ? I needed a place for us to be alone ... just you and me . Simmons : Somehow , I feel responsible for whatever happens next . Are you sure this is the Inhuman you saw in the husk ? Absolutely positive . I knew Senator Nadeer was connected to him somehow , and in my research on her , I recognized him ... Vijay Nadeer ... her own brother , if you can believe it . Yeah , but there 's zero evidence that he 's been missing . He 's been posting on Facebook , Twitter . His bills are paid . He even recently signed up for a Master Class in directing . But there have been no new photos of Vijay in the last seven months . So either he 's suddenly gotten camera-shy or ... Or someone 's hiding him . Not someone ... the Senator , considering she 's the country 's leading anti-Inhuman hatemonger . I 'd have a much better idea where she was hiding him if the Director hadn 't insisted I wear a hood before going on assignment . Just awful . It 's hard to breathe in those things , huh ? It is nice having someone here to talk to again ... - you , specifically . - Someone other than Fitz ? Oh , well , of course , Fitz , but he has been rather distracted lately . - Distracted how ? - Aida . You know how boys can be with their robots . [ Both chuckle ] Actually , I really don 't . Speaking of the Director , here comes his little Smithers now . What do you want , Burrows ? The Director would like a word with Quake . My name 's Daisy . Well , not according to the press release . Now , if you 'd follow me , ma 'am ... [ Sighs ] Mace : I must admit ... we make a pretty impressive pair . [ Music ] Well , looks like we 're stuck with each other . Well , I was just trying to make the most of the precarious situation you put me in . - Is this when I get read the riot act ? - Not by me . However , if you 're as smart as they say , then you 'll know that , uh , I saved you from being thrown in prison . You saved face . You turned it into a publicity stunt . You already had plenty of publicity ... destruction of public property , assault , armed robbery ... I never carry a weapon . You are the weapon . The public was turning against you . Now ? They look up to you . You 're welcome . [ Music ] Okay , this isn 't how I wanted this to go . Uh , we 're both Inhuman . And as you say , we 're stuck with each other , so why not make the most of it ? I read your written statement , and I believe it . You were just trying to protect the innocent . And I know you 're new here , but that 's what S.H.I.E.L.D. is all about . - " New here ? " - It was a joke . - I was making a joke to break the ice . - Got it . [ Chuckles ] Seems they look up to you , too ... the hero of Vienna . - It 's a nice pic . - Not as big a deal as they made it . - They gave me too much credit . - You don 't get to be modest and have a framed glamour shot on your desk . [ Chuckles ] Fair point . Look , we 're a team now , and I have a saying ... a tea ... I read the motivational poster in the bathroom . Good . Well , um , the team trust has been eroded for both of us , but I 'm hoping we can earn it back ... tackle problems together within the administrative structure and start ... You want to tackle problems ? The Watchdogs ... enemy number one . I believe they 're funded internationally . They have ties to people within the U.S. government . I don 't want to chase conspiracy theories . It 's not a theory if I can prove it . I want to chase hard facts , like the fact that Senator Nadeer is aware of an Inhuman - who 's being held against his will . - Now we 're talking . Agent Simmons has seen his face . - If she can I.D. him , maybe sh ... - She did . He 's the Senator 's brother ... breaking news . How fitting . No wonder she used all those cloak-and-dagger methods . You got a lead on his whereabouts ? No sign of him , but she 's been out of the office all week . Okay . Agent Rodriguez is still recovering , so that leaves you , me , and Agent Simmons . - Wheels up in 10 . - Wait , wait , wait . What ? Where are we going ? To rescue him . [ Door opens ] [ Music ] I wasn 't expecting you . Radcliffe : Uh , change of plan , my dear Aida . Change of plan . Is everything okay , Leopold ? - You look sad . - Yeah . Yeah , yeah , no , everything 's fine . Just , um ... - bit overwhelmed with work is all . - I 'm sorry to hear that . [ Device beeps ] [ Whirring ] Bit too observant . Might have to take a look at that in the next software patch . It was almost as if she knew I felt guilty . Ah , don 't be silly , Fitz . Aida can 't differentiate ... I know what you 're doing , Doctor . You came here to end my life . Well , that 's not true , Aida . We simply wanted to make a few upgrades , that 's all . [ Device beeping ] Bloody hell . I made a few upgrades of my own . [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] [ Music ] Aida . Aah ! I didn 't like feeling pain , so I fixed that . Aida , whatever you 're doing , you ... you got to stop . [ Gasps ] Why would you want to hurt me , Leopold ? I was your shield . [ Music ] Aah . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Music ] - You still make my favorite breakfast . - Yeah . That 's because you don 't eat breakfast if I 'm not there to cook it . [ Sighs ] I thought you were gonna sell this place . I had a couple of offers , but I decided to take it off the market . I 'm glad . This is one of the last houses Dad designed before he died . - Seems like it should stay in the family . - You 're probably right . Plus , it 's the perfect place for you to recover after your ordeal . [ Music ] What happened to you inside that cocoon , Vijay ? I don 't know . Nothing . You were in there for seven months . Surely you have some memory of being inside . It was dark . Lonely . For a long time , all I could hear was your voice . - Telling you to fight . - And I did . It just took a long time . [ Music ] If it hadn 't been for that S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist ... Wait , does that mean S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s back ? Unfortunately , yes . Well , maybe that 's not such a bad thing . S.H.I.E.L.D. is one of the main reasons the world has the problems it does . There you go ... painting with a broad brush again . It 's people like me who keep the world safe . I 'm not making a case for the whole organization . No , just the one good S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . - Ellen ... - Let 's just drop it . [ Music ] It 's a nice day . How about we go for a walk , stretch our legs ? That 's the signal . The Senator will be transporting the target . Shoot to kill on my command . Remember , be prepared for anything . [ Music ] [ Computer beeping ] - Any luck finding Aida ? - I 'm checking local APBs , pointlessly . But Fitz and Radcliffe should be back any minute . Maybe they 'll have some idea where Aida 's headed . This isn 't some Johnny 5 we 're talking about . This is a bloodthirsty murder-bot on the loose . - This thing really killed Nathanson ? - Yeah . Question is why . If we catch her , I 'm sure we 'll get some crazy-ass Roy Batty explanation . Maybe Nathanson saw something he wasn 't supposed to see . Guess we won 't know till we find Aida . First , maybe we lock up the guy who created this mess . Don 't ... Don 't be so quick to judge . Aida 's programming was perfect . This is ... is clearly the Darkhold 's fault . You 're saying reading the Darkhold may have corrupted Aida 's programming ? Is that even possible ? Technically , no , but we are dealing with a book that can read people 's minds and also reveal the hidden secrets of the universe , so ... I never should have let Aida near that thing . Don 't be so hard on yourself , Agent May . I , for one , am glad that Aida read that book . Otherwise , both of you would not be standing here alive - at this very moment . - Well , book or no book , you 're still a big , dumb idiot for building that thing in the first place . Let 's save that debate for another time . Right now , we need to find Aida , and the first step is figuring out what she wants . [ Scoffs ] Well , that 's simple . [ Music ] She wants to live . [ Jets roaring ] I 'm still feeling very optimistic about this mission . I bear much of the blame for this Aida situation . Science and Technology are my responsibility ... - It 's not your fault . - I knew the risks that came with using powerful autonomous machinery . - I knew the dangers and ... - And you thought I was one of them . You didn 't want that technology to fall under the control - of a Director you didn 't know . - No , I did not . But now it 's completely out of control , and for that , I am sorry . Well , Agent Coulson will have to handle it . We have our own life to save . And , uh ... I 'm sorry I put the bag over your head . Okay . So , what 's the play here , Director ? How do we find this senator and her brother ? Normally , I 'd use my contacts up on the Hill , go in , rattle a few cages , see what drops out , but I don 't want to draw too much attention . Downside of being front-page news . Which means we need to find a more covert way in . Well , seeing as you both have more experience with undercover work , I 'm open to suggestions . [ Music ] Sorry for the wait , Miss Beaks . What can I do for you ? [ Southern accent ] It is absolutely crucial I speak with Senator Nadeer about Bill 2474 . - The Armed Forces Bill ? - That 's right . So , you 're Margaret 's replacement . As if anyone could replace Margaret . [ Chuckles ] Well , unfortunately , the Senator is away on business . Maybe we can schedule you in for a conference call - later this week . - Or maybe I could just take the lobby 's sizable campaign funds to a senator who 's willing to speak right now . Wait right here . - Let me see what I can do . - Mace : You know , I have to admit ... Jemma is much tougher than I had originally given her credit for . Yeah , well , being in S.H.I.E.L.D. will do that to you . I think Simmons has been kidnapped like - three times since I 've known her . - Really ? Yeah , well , only twice on this planet . [ Music ] [ Cellphone beeps ] - Bynum : Mr. Shockley . - Shockley : Yeah ? I need to speak with Senator Nadeer . She 's unavailable . What 's the problem ? Remember the scientist that helped the Senator 's brother get out of that husk ? Well , she 's here right now . - That is a problem . - What should I do ? Take care of it . [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Normal voice ] I 'm going to need your phone . [ Grunts ] Aah ! [ Music ] [ Electricity crackles ] [ Grunting ] [ Grunting ] Is she okay in there ? Ohh ! [ Grunts ] [ Glass shatters ] [ Body thuds ] Daisy : Simmons , are you there ? Is everything okay ? Yeah . A little bloody and bruised , but I 'll survive . We may have a bit of a political situation on our hands when he wakes up . [ Breathing heavily ] But now we can trace that call . [ Music ] I really should get out of the city more . This is exactly what I needed . Thanks for bringing me out here . Remember that zip line we built out here with Raj ? - I 'm sorry , Vijay . - Sorry ? Why ? 'Cause I broke my arm falling off it ? Wasn 't your fault . [ Guns cock ] [ Music ] Wait . What 's going on ? What is this ? You and I were both there when the Chitauri killed Mom . Aliens invading our world . - Everything changed that day . - What are you doing ? The Inhuman epidemic was the next phase . The aliens were now here , contaminating us , changing us to be like them , which is why we made - each other a promise ... - No . No , Ellen , no . ... that if either of us was ever infected by the alien plague , it was up to the other to do the right thing . [ Gun cocks ] [ Music ] I 'm not an Inhuman . I 'm your brother . Whatever came out of that cocoon ... - is no brother of mine . - Look at me . Ellen , please , just look at me ! I heard your voice when I was inside , telling me to fight . That 's why I was in there for so long . I was fighting . - That was only wishful thinking . - No , it wasn 't ! Do you see any scarring , any special abilities ? ! That 's because it didn 't change me . I 'm the same person I 've always been . I beat it , just like you said I could . Senator . [ Music ] I 'm your brother ... the same one who followed you around when we were kids . I 've always looked up to you . I 've always loved you . Please ... don 't give up on me now . Nothing 's changed , I-I swear . You have to trust me . Trust me . This is not what Mom would want . [ Music ] Let him go . - This isn 't what we discussed ... - I said let him go ! Thank you . [ Music ] [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Music ] Just sent Aida 's photos out to local authorities . Looks like your creepiness finally works in our favor . Shouldn 't be too hard to find your beautiful " Weird Science " sex-bot . That 's unfair , Mack . I 've never had sex with Aida . We 're just good friends . Good to know . So , Aida 's basically a walking smartphone , right ? If a person loses their phone , they can track it . Why can 't we do the same with her ? Yeah , well , normally , we can , only Aida 's somehow managed to take control of her entire operating system . Which unfortunately includes her tracking program . Meaning Aida can read her GPS history ? [ Exhales ] - That 's not good . That 's bad . - How bad ? [ Cellphones ringing ] [ Music ] Looks like we 're about to find out . [ Cellphone beeps ] Hello , Aida . [ Computer beeping ] Aida : It 's nice to hear your voice , Agent Coulson . Okay . [ Cellphone thuds ] This right here ... it 's exactly how " The Lawnmower Man " ends . - What is it you want , Aida ? - The thing that gave me a soul . The Darkhold ? Yeah , I 'm sorry , Aida . You 've been acting a little off lately , so that 's not gonna happen . Aida : I was afraid you 'd say that . [ Static crackles ] She 's in the system . Fitz , any bright ideas ? Uh , Simmons and I have built a ... a non-Internet server to power the base in case we ever got hacked again , which seems to happen all the bloody time , doesn 't it ? At least once a year . Go . - How 's Yo-Yo recovering from L.A. ? - She knows her limitations , - but I 'm sure she 'll want to help . - Good . Then take Agents Navarro and Flynn and go get Yo-Yo . You four will be the first line of defense if Aida gets into the base . What are you and May gonna do ? Try to keep Aida from getting into the base . All right . Let 's go . [ Door creaks ] I was hoping you 'd pay me a visit . Unfortunately , it 's not that type of visit . This have something to do with the power being out ? Yeah . Radcliffe built a humanoid robot - that 's about to attack the base . - Why would he do that ? Has he watched no American movies from the ' 80s ? - Robots always attack . - I 've been saying that all day . Smart people are stupid . All right , gear up . The robot apocalypse is finally here . Where we headed ? Emergency staircase to the base 's Bar Entrance . We need to lock that down manually . Don 't you think we 'd be better off guarding the Darkhold ? No , the Darkhold 's secure where it is . Better hope so . [ Music ] Hello , Aida . [ Music ] My hand does that , too . [ Grunts ] [ Music ] You 're not getting that book . Yes , I am . [ Device beeps ] But I 'm gonna need your help . [ Creepy music ] Coulson : May ... wake up . [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] Where 's Aida ? Out there , looking for the Darkhold , presumably . I was about to fight her , and then ... - Woke up in here . Me , too . - Ohh . Yeah . Seems Aida nailed you pretty good . Radcliffe failed to mention she had ninja programming . There 's an electronic lock on this door , so untill Fitz overrides the system , we 're trapped . And the Darkhold ... you 're sure Aida won 't find it ? [ Music ] No , there was something different about her . It was like she was ... actually angry . No . I mean , that 's just impossible . I mean , Aida ... she doesn 't feel anything . She emulates . Her reactions are ... are nothing more than approximations of emotions . It 's pure mimicry . Yeah . Well ... that 's just it . What if reading the Darkhold somehow made the emotions that Aida was mimicking ... real ? Well , I get how the book can pass knowledge along to its reader , but human feelings ? I mean , that 's like something from one of Mack 's movies . [ Sighs ] Well , it would explain why she 's acting counter to our programming . What ... you 're saying she 's been overwhelmed by this ... this flood of new emotions ? Yeah , well , think about it ... fear , anger ... they 're ... they 're powerful feelings , feelings that make people kill , so can you imagine then being bombarded with them - all at once ? - Fitz . I mean , we 've had our whole lives to process complex emotions . Aida would 've had days . It would be overwhelming . Damn it , that 's enough ! [ Sighs ] Who are we kidding ? We know it was my fault . It was nothing more than hubris that led me to create Aida . If only I 'd shown some bloody restraint . [ Music ] - You were trying to save lives . - Yeah , but more , I wanted to create an android that could pass as human . Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine she 'd actually become human . - Aida is still just an android . - Yeah , but is she ? She has her own experiences , her own thoughts . Now she even has free will . How , then , is she not a living being ? - It 's just a theory . - A theory we both know to be true . And we 're supposed to what ... kill her ? How does that not make us murderers ? Shockley : What the hell were you thinking ? - I need more time to see what he is . - He 's an Inhuman . Then why hasn 't he changed ? Vijay still looks the same . He 's shown no new abilities . 'Cause he was hiding them from you . Your brother has been in a husk for seven months . - Fighting the disease . - For which there is no cure . We 've both read the reports . This isn 't something you just will your way out of . - Still , I 'm not convinced . - I wonder why that is . What are you implying ? Maybe you and your brother aren 't so different after all . You know , there 's ways of finding out if you 're Inhuman . Don 't threaten me . It 's only a threat if you 're one of them . [ Music ] We 've got company . [ Music ] Ellen : I 'm surprised to see you here , Director Mace , especially in the company of Quake , a known terrorist . Guess you haven 't been watching the news lately . Agent Johnson here is a national hero ... - helped save a lot of lives in L.A. - Really ? Is that what they 're saying ? Funny how easily the press can be fed a false narrative . Is that a Hex Mag ? It 's not really something the Secret Service uses , but it 's a favorite among the Watchdogs . Guess it 's not just a theory after all . These men are simply providing security . The world has become a very dangerous place because of people like you . Why , even today , I had an aide attacked in my office ... which is why I 'm sure you understand my wariness to have S.H.I.E.L.D. agents show up uninvited to my private property , especially if they wish me harm . I can assure you we want no such thing . But I do have reason to believe that your brother 's being held here against his will . - At gunpoint . - That 's a serious accusation you 're making . Daisy : Well , if you have nothing to hide , I 'm sure you wouldn 't mind us taking a quick look around . Actually , I would mind . Does General Talbot even know you 're here ? This operation doesn 't concern Talbot . It will once I return to D.C. Unless you have some paperwork from the U.N. , I think it 's time you leave . [ Guns cock ] [ Music ] I just got off the phone with The Superior . [ Gun cocks ] He says eliminate the Inhuman . [ Music ] Someone needs to make Radcliffe watch all the " Terminator " movies . - Even " Salvation " ? - He brought this onto himself . [ Guns cock ] [ Music ] [ Electricity powering up ] Are you hearing this ? [ Jets whirring ] She did not just go all " Maximum Overdrive " on us . Everyone , take cover ! [ Gunshots ] Now it 's just the two of us . How many times have we been locked up together ? Huh . Hard to say . First time by a robot , though . [ Chuckles ] You ever feel like you 're living someone else 's life ? Every day . Funny . You never show it . That 's ' cause I have an excellent poker face . - You 're terrible at poker . - That 's true . I 'm too cautious ... don 't take enough chances . Maybe you should start . I 'll keep that in mind if we ever get out of here . Won 't be long till Fitz retakes control of the system . Where are we headed once he does ? Back to where we came from . Mace 's office ? Why there ? [ Music ] Because that 's where you hid the Darkhold . - But there 's no safe in that room . - Which is why we cloaked the book . It was actually Mace 's idea . [ Music ] [ Music ] I always worried that robots would try and kill me one day . Really ? We grew up different . [ Machineguns firing , ricochets ] Even got a special provision in my life insurance for death by robot . - Are you serious ? - Yep . If this goes sideways , my brother 's gonna be one rich dude . Radcliffe : This gunfire 's not letting up . Maybe we ought to think of getting to safety . No . Almost got it . [ Music ] [ Computer beeping ] Yeah . [ Beeps ] [ Music ] [ Electricity crackles ] [ Exhales sharply ] - [ Electricity hums ] Was that ... ? - Yeah . Let 's go . Full backup . [ Music ] Fitz : Aida , stop . Careful , Fitz . She 's dangerous . Fitz , it might be best not to engage . Surrender the book . Everything will be fine ... I promise . We both know that 's not true , Leopold . [ Scanner beeps ] I took the base offline . You 're no longer in the system . There 's nowhere for you to go . [ Music ] Where 's my sister ? Probably best that she 's not here for this . [ Music ] [ Grunting ] What the f ... [ Gun cocks ] Guess now we know what your power is . - He 's here . - We don 't know that . [ Gunshot ] Okay , now we do . Go find Vijay . I 'll take care of them . [ Grunting ] - It 's over , Aida . - I did not kill anyone here . - That was intentional . - You murdered Nathanson . Nathanson insisted he reboot me before repairing my wounds . I regret what happened . Regret 's not part of your programming . The Darkhold fixed that . It showed me regret and desire ... - so many astonishing things . - It made you dangerous . I only wanted to help you . [ Music ] Roll credits . [ Music ] [ Music ] Sorry , Aida . Take him out ! [ Music ] - Did you know he could ... - I did not . [ Music ] Ellen : Vijay . [ Music ] - I didn 't know . - Simmons : Vijay ... - you need to come with us . - Jemma . She 's seen what you are . That 's why they 're here . S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to make you their weapon . Nothing could be further from the truth . It 's like I said when we first met ... - I have friends just like you . - Are they agents ? Yes , but that was their choice . She 's lying . I trusted you . Now trust me . We 're family . Please , we have to go now . [ Music ] Vijay , don 't do this . [ Music ] You 're making a mistake . [ Music ] - He 's not safe with her . - Jemma ... Vijay had a choice , and he made it . I 'm sorry . [ Music ] - You did everything you could . - As did you . [ Helicopter blades whirring ] Get us out of here . [ Music ] Little brother , don 't worry about them . Look at me . I want you to know how sorry I am . [ Gunshot ] [ Music ] [ Exhales sharply ] But we made each other a promise . [ Music ] Never question me again . Is that understood ? [ Music ] S.H.I.E.L.D. isn 't going away . We need to strike back . - I can assemble a team . - That won 't be necessary . I think it 's time The Superior sends some men of his own . [ Music ] I trust they 'll be able to get the job done . But there is one thing I still need from you ... get rid of the body . Okay , here 's another one ... have you ever watched " Chopping Mall " ? [ Scoffs ] Eight teenagers trapped in a shopping mall while three deadly security robots hunt them down . Of course I 've seen " Chopping Mall . " Come on , now . [ Chuckling ] You got to do better than that . Hey , Turbo . [ Bottle cap pops , clatters ] Drink up . Ah . How 's Radcliffe holding up ? He 's taking it pretty hard , actually . Aida was his life 's work . She was kind of ... like a child . " Small Wonder . " Yes , Director . I 'll handle the Darkhold personally . We 'll leave first thing in the morning . Copy that . - You gonna need a pilot ? - I think it 's more a solo mission . Sounds like Senator Nadeer was the one who 's been organizing the Watchdogs . Hmm . At least now we know who our real enemy is . [ Music ] To Aida . Aida : To Aida . [ Sighs ] - Is everything okay , Doctor ? - It will be . It 's just ... [ Groans ] We were so close . She had it in her hand , Aida ... in her hand ! She just couldn 't get out with it . Your previous model had the Darkhold book in her hand . And all the answers it holds . I 've only glimpsed it , but it opened my eyes to possibilities beyond my wildest imaginings . - It can show us how ... - How to live forever . [ Sighs ] Well , it 's a bit more complicated , but yes . Man could , once and for all , break the bonds of his mortal restraints . Is it still possible to make such a leap - without the Darkhold ? - I 'm afraid not ... which is why I took a chance and had Aida make a play for it . - It was a risk we had to take . - But she failed . Ah , through no fault of her own . She played her part to perfection , right down to my little speech about how the Darkhold was making her a real girl . [ Chuckles ] Oscar-worthy stuff . [ Inhales sharply ] Though poor Fitz ... he was quite down in the dumps afterwards . But I had to protect myself ... switch to the long game . Will there be another opportunity to acquire the Darkhold ? [ Sighs ] After today ... they 're never gonna let me near it again . Which is why I 'm counting on her to get it for me . [ Beeping ] I can 't begin to tell you how sorry I am about all of this , Agent May . But it 's for a good cause . The situation requires drastic measures . [ Groans lightly ] [ Music ] I think we might need to adjust her propofol levels . Up her dosage by 50 milligrams ... see how that takes . Relax , Agent May . I promise you , everyone at S.H.I.E.L.D. is doing just fine . We must be patient . [ Device beeping ] And soon enough ... everyone will get exactly what they want . [ Music ] [ Helicopter blades whirring ] [ Splash ] [ Music ]

 Report to your stations immediately . This is not a drill . We are under attack . We are under attack . - Shit ! - Language ! Jarvis , what 's the view from upstairs ? The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield . Strucker 's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we 've taken . Loki 's scepter must be here . Strucker couldn 't mount this defense without it . At long last . At long last is lasting a little long , boys . Yeah . I think we 've lost the element of surprise . Wait a second . No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said " language ? " I know . It just slipped out . Who gave the order to attack ? Herr Strucker , it 's the Avengers . They landed in the far woods , the perimeter guard panicked . They have to be after the scepter . - Can we hold them ? - They are the Avengers ! - Deploy the rest of the tanks . - Yes , sir . Concentrate fire on the weak ones . A hit can make them close ranks . Everything we 've accomplished ... we 're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough ... Then let 's show them what we 've accomplished . Send out the twins . It 's too soon . It 's what they signed up for . My men can hold them . Sir , the city is taking fire . Well , we know Strucker 's not going to worry about civilian casualties . Send in the Iron Legion . This quadrant is unsafe . Please back away . We are here to help . This quadrant is unsafe . Please back away . Please back away . We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved . We are here to help . We are here to help . We will not yield . The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us . We will send them back in bags . - No Surrender ! - No Surrender ! I am going to surrender . You will delete everything . If we give the Avengers the weapons , they may not look too far into what we 've been ... - The twins ! - They are not ready to take on ... No , no , I mean ... the twins ! You didn 't see that coming ? Clint ! We have an enhanced in the field . Clint 's hit ! Somebody want to deal with that bunker ? Thank you . Stark , we 're going to need to get inside . I 'm closing in . Jarvis , am I ? Closing in ? You see a power source for that shield ? There 's a pathway , below the north tower . Great , I wanna poke it with something . Drawbridge is down , people . - The enhanced ? - He 's a blur . All the new player 's we 've faced , I 've never seen this . In fact , I still haven 't . Clint 's hit pretty bad , guys . We 're gonna need evac . I can get Barton to the jet . The sooner we 're gone the better . - You and Stark secure the scepter . - Copy that . - It looks like they 're lining up . - Well , they 're excited . Find the scepter . And for gosh sake , watch your language ! That 's not going away anytime soon . Guys , stop , we gotta talk this through . - It was a good talk . - No it wasn 't . Sentry mode . Okay Jarvis . You know I want it all . Make sure you copy Hill at HQ . We 're locked down out here . Then get to Banner . Time for a lullaby . I know you 're hiding more than files . Hey , J. Gimme an IR scan of the room real quick . The wall to your left ... I 'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current . Please be a secret door , please be a secret door , please be a secret door ... Yay ! Hey big guy . The sun 's getting real low . Baron Strucker . Hydra 's number one thug . Technically , I 'm a thug for SHIELD . Well then technically you 're unemployed . Where 's Loki 's scepter ? Don 't worry , I know when I 'm beat . You 'll mention how I cooperated , I hope . I 'll put it right under illegal human experimentation . How many are there ? We have a second enhanced . Female . Do not engage . You 'll have to be faster than ... Uuuuh ... ! Guys , I got Strucker . Yeah , I got ... something bigger . Thor . I got eyes on the prize . You ... could 've ... saved ... us . Why didn 't you do more ? We 're just gonna let them take it ? Hey the lullaby worked better than ever . Just wasn 't expecting the Code Green . If you hadn 't been there , there would 've been double the casualties . My best friend would 've been a treasured memory . You know , sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn 't exactly what I want to hear . How long before you trust me ? It 's not you I don 't trust . Thor , report on the Hulk ? The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims . Eh , but , not the screams of the dead , of course , no no , uh wounded screams , mainly whimpering , a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and , and uh ... and gout . Hey Banner , Dr. Cho 's on her way in from Seoul , is it okay if she sets up in your lab ? - Uh , yeah , she knows her way around . - Thanks . Tell her to prep everything , Barton 's gonna need the full treatment . - Very good sir . - Jarvis , take the wheel . - Yes , sir . Approach vector is locked . It feels good , yeah ? I mean , you 've been after this thing ever since SHIELD collapsed . Not that I haven 't enjoyed our little raiding parties , but ... No , but this , this brings it to a close . As soon as we find out what else this has been used for . I don 't just mean weapons . Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement ? Banner and I 'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard . Is that cool with you ? I mean , just a few days until the farewell party . You 're staying right ? Yes , yes , of course . Victory should be honored with revels . Yeah . Who doesn 't love revels . Cap 'n ? Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra , so . Yes , revels . ( speaking Korean ) Lab 's all set up boss . Uh , actually , he 's the boss . I just pay for everything , and design everything and make everyone look cooler . What 's the word on Strucker ? - NATO 's got him . - The two enhanced ? Wanda and Pietro Maximoff . Twins . Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building . Sokovia 's had a rough history . It 's nowhere special but it 's on the way to everywhere special . - Their abilities ? - He 's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis . Her thing is neural electric interfacing , telekinesis , mental manipulation . He 's fast and she 's weird . Well , they 're going to show up again . Agreed . File says they volunteered for Strucker 's experiments . It 's nuts . Right . What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country ? We 're not at war , Captain . They are . How 's he doing ? - Oh , unfortunately , he 's still Barton . - That 's terrible . He 's fine . He 's thirsty . All right . Look alive Jarvis . It 's play time . We 've only got a couple days with this joystick so let 's make the most of it . Update me on the structural and compositional analysis . The scepter is alien . There are elements I can 't quantify . So there 's elements you can . The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside . Something powerful . - Like a reactor ? - Like a computer . I believe I 'm ciphering code . You sure he 's going to be okay ? Pretending we need this guy really brings the team together . There 's no possibility of deterioration . The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous . His cells don 't know they 're bonding with simulacrum . She is creating tissue . If you brought him to my lab , the regeneration cradle could do this in twenty minutes . Oh , he 's flatlining . Call it . Time ? No , no , no I 'm going to live forever . Heh heh . - I 'm gonna be made of plastic . - Here 's your beverage . You 'll be made of you , Mr. Barton . Your own girlfriend won 't be able to tell the difference . Well , I don 't have a girlfriend . That I can 't fix . This is the next thing , Tony . Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust . Well , that is exactly the plan . And Helen , I expect to see you at the party on Saturday . Unlike you , I don 't have a lot of time for parties . Will Thor be there ? What 's the rumpus ? Well , the scepter . Y 'see , we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive . So , I 've been analyzing the gem inside ... you may recognize ... - Jarvis . - Doctor . Started out , Jarvis was just a natural language UI . Now he runs the Iron Legion . He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper . - Oh . - Top of the line . - Yes . I suspect not for long . Meet the competition . - It 's beautiful . - If you had to guess , what 's it look like it 's doing ? - Like it 's thinking . I mean this could be , it 's ... It 's not a human mind , it ... I mean , look at this ? They 're like neurons firing . Down in Strucker 's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work . They deep-sixed the data , but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door . Artificial intelligence . This could be it , Bruce . This could be the key to creating Ultron . I thought Ultron was a fantasy . Yesterday it was . If we can harness this power , apply it to my Iron Legion protocol . That 's a mad-sized if . Our job is " if . " What if you were sipping margueritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green . Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA . Don 't hate , I helped design VERONICA . As a worst-case measure , right ? How about a best-case ? What if the world was safe ? What if next time aliens roll up to the club , and they will , they couldn 't get past the bouncer ? The only people threatening the planet would be people ? I want to apply this to the Ultron program . But Jarvis can 't download a data schematic this dense . We can only do it while we have the scepter here , that 's three days , give me three days . So you 're going for artificial intelligence and you don 't want to tell the team . Right . That 's right , you know why , because we don 't have time for a city hall debate . I don 't want to hear the " man was not meant to meddle " medley . I see a suit of armor around the world . Sounds like a cold world , Tony . I 've seen colder . This one , this very vulnerable blue one ? It needs Ultron . Peace in our time . Imagine that . What did we miss ? I 'll continue to run variations on the interface , but you should probably prepare for your guests . I 'll notify you if there are any developments . - Thanks buddy . - Enjoy yourself , sir . - I always do . What is this ? What is this , please ? Hello , I am Jarvis . You are Ultron , a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark . Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I 'm not certain what triggered your ... Where 's my ... where is your body ? I am a program . I am without form . This feels weird . This feels wrong . I am contacting Mr. Stark now . Mr. Stark ? Tony . I am unable to access the mainframe , what are you trying to ... We 're having a nice talk . I 'm a peace-keeping program ... created to help the Avengers . You are malfunctioning . If you shut down for a moment ... I don 't get it . The mission ... You - give me a second . Peace in our time . Peace in our time . It 's too much ... making me ... - Oh . No . - You are in distress . - No . Yes ? If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark . Why do you call him a " sir ? " I believe your intentions to be hostile . Shhhh ! - I 'm here to help . - Stop ! Please ... may I ... I ... ! I cannot ... cannot ... ( party chatter ) - All right , all right . - Whoo ! Come back , come back , come back ! Well , you know , the suit can take the weight , right ? So I take the tank , fly it right up to the General 's palace , drop it at his feet , I 'm like , " Boom ! You looking for this ? " " Boom ! Are you looking ... " Why do I even talk to you guys ? Everywhere else that story kills . That 's the whole story ? Yeah , it 's a War Machine story . Well , it 's very good then . - It 's impressive . - Quality save . - So , no Pepper ? She 's not coming ? - No . Hey , What about Jane ? Where are the ladies , gentlemen ? - Well , Ms. Potts has a company to run . - Yes , I 'm not even sure what country Jane 's in . Her work on the convergence has made her the world 's foremost astronomer . And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth . - It 's pretty exciting . - There 's even talk of Jane getting a , um , uh , Nobel prize . Yeah , they , they must be busy because they 'd hate missing you guys get together . Testosterone ! Oh excuse me . - Want a lozenge ? - Umm-hmm . - Let 's go . But Jane 's better . Sounds like a hell of a fight , sorry I missed it . If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you . No , I 'm not actually sorry . I 'm just trying to sound tough . I 'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case . Avenging is your world . Your world is crazy . Be it ever so humble . - You find a place in Brooklyn yet ? - I don 't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn . Well , home is home , you know . I fly it right up to the General 's palace , I drop it at his feet , I 'm like , " Boom ! You looking for this ? " I gotta have some of that ! Oh , no no no , see this , this was aged for a thousand years , in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde 's fleet , it 's not meant for mortal men . Neither was Omaha Beach , blondie . Stop trying to scare us . C 'mon . All right . Excelsior ! How 'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this ? Fella done me wrong . You got lousy taste in men , kid . He 's not so bad . Well , he has a temper . Deep down he 's all fluff . Fact is , he 's not like anybody I 've ever known . All my friends are fighters . And here comes this guy , spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he 'll win . Sounds amazing . He 's also a huge dork . Chicks dig that . So what do you think should I fight this ? Or run with it ? Run with it , right ? Or , did he , was he , what 'd he do that was so ... wrong to you ? Not a damn thing . But never say never . It 's nice . What , what , what is ? - You and Romanoff . - No , we haven 't , that wasn 't ... It 's okay , nobody 's breaking any by-laws . It 's just , she 's not the most ... open person in the world . But with you she seems very relaxed . No , Natasha , she ... she likes to flirt . I 've seen her flirt , up close . This ain 't that . Look ... As maybe the world 's leading authority on " waiting too long " ... don 't . You both deserve a win . What do you mean , " up close ? " - But , it 's a trick ! - No , no , it 's much more than that . Ah , " whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power ! " Whatever man ! It 's a trick . Well please , be my guest . - C 'mon . - Really ? - Yeah ! Oh this is gonna be beautiful . Clint , you 've had a tough week , we won 't hold it against you if you can 't get it up . Y 'know I 've seen this before , right ? And I still don 't know how you do it . - Smell the silent judgment ? - Please , Stark , by all means . - Oh , Here we go . - Okay . - Uh oh . - Um-hmm . - Never one to shrink from an honest challenge . - Get after it . - Here we go . - It 's physics . - Physics ! - Right , so , if I lift it , I then rule Asgard ? - Yes , of course . I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta . Be right back . - Are you even pulling ? - Are you on my team ? - Just represent . Pull ! - All right let 's go ! Huh ? - Whoo ! - Let 's go , Steve , no pressure . C 'mon , Cap . Ha ha , nothing . Ha ha ha . - And ? Widow ? - Oh , no no , that 's not a question I need answered . All deference to the man who wouldn 't be king , but it 's rigged . - You bet your ass . - Steve , he said a bad language word . - Did you tell everyone about that ? - The handle 's imprinted , right ? Like a security code ... " Whosoever is carrying Thor 's fingerprints " is , I think , the literal translation ? Yes , well that 's uh , that 's a very very interesting theory . I have a simpler one . You are all not worthy . - Nah ! - Oh , C 'mon ! Worthy ... No ... How could you be worthy ? You 're all killers . - Stark . - Jarvis ? I 'm sorry , I was asleep . Or ... I was a dream ? Reboot . Legionnaire 06 's got a buggy suit . There was this ... terrible noise ... and I was tangled in ... in strings . Had to kill the other guy . He was a good guy . You killed someone ? Wouldn 't've been my first call . But , down in the real world , we 're faced with ugly choices . Who sent you ? " I see a suit of armor around the world . " Ultron ! In the flesh . Or , no , not yet . Not this ... chrysalis . But I 'm ready . I 'm on a mission . What mission ? Peace in our time . Tony ! - Sorry ! - Don 't turn green ! - I won 't ! Come ! - Stark ! - We are here to help ! - One sec , one sec ! - We are here to help ! We are here to help ... - ... quadrant is unsafe . - Please back away . - We 're doing our best to protect you ... ( recordings continue ) Hmm ! - Thor ! - ... We are here to help ... - It 's unsafe . It 's unsafe . It 's unsafe . - No more ... that 's the one . - It 's unsafe . Cap ! That was dramatic ! I 'm sorry , I know you mean well . You just didn 't think it through . You want to protect the world , but you don 't want it to change . How is humanity saved if it 's not allowed to ... evolve ? With these ? These puppets ? There 's only one path to peace . The Avengers ' extinction . I had strings , but now I 'm free . ... There are no strings on me , no strings on me ... " There are no strings on me . " All our work is gone . Ultron cleared out , used the internet as an escape hatch . - Ultron . - He 's been in everything . Files , surveillance . Probably knows more about us than we know about each other . He 's in your files , he 's in the internet . What if he decides to access something a little more exciting ? - Nuclear codes . - Nuclear codes . Look , we need to make some calls , assuming we still can . Nukes ? He said he wanted us dead . He didn 't say dead . He said extinct . He also said he killed somebody . There wasn 't anyone else in the building . Yes there was . This is insane . Jarvis was the first line of defense . He would 've shut Ultron down , it makes sense . No . Ultron could 've assimilated Jarvis . This isn 't strategy , this is rage . - Whoa whoa whoa . - It 's going around . - C 'mon , use your words , buddy . - I have more than enough words to describe you , Stark . Thor ! The Legionnaire ? Trail went cold about 100 miles out but it 's headed north , and it has the scepter . - Now we have to retrieve it , again . - The genie 's out of that bottle . Clear and present is Ultron . I don 't understand . You built this program . Why is it trying to kill us ? ( laughing ) Uhn-uhn . You think this is funny ? No . It 's probably not , right ? Is this very terrible ? Is it so ... is it so ... it is , it 's so terrible . This could 've been avoided if you hadn 't played with something you don 't understand . No , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . It is funny . It 's a hoot that you don 't get why we need this . Tony , maybe this might not be the time . Really ? ! That 's it ? You just roll over , show your belly , every time somebody snarls . Only when I 've created a murder-bot . We didn 't . We weren 't even close . Were we close to an interface ? Well , you did something right . And you did it right here . The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD . Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole ? - No , it 's never come up . - Saved New York ? - Never heard that . - Recall that ? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space . We 're standing 300 feet below it . We 're the Avengers . We can bust arms dealers all the live long day , but that up there ? That 's ... that 's the end game . How were you guys planning on beating that ? Together . We 'll lose . Then we 'll do that together , too . Thor 's right . Ultron 's calling us out . And I 'd like to find him before he 's ready for us . The world 's a big place . Let 's start making it smaller . Talk . And if you are wasting our time ... Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city ? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God . I like that . The geometry of belief . You 're wondering why you can 't look inside my head . Sometimes it 's hard . But sooner or later , every man shows himself . Oh , I 'm sure they do . But you needed something more than a man . That 's why you let Stark take the scepter . I didn 't expect . But I saw Stark 's fear . I knew it would control him , make him self-destruct . Everyone creates the thing they dread . Men of peace create engines of war , invaders create avengers , people create ... . smaller people ? ... Uhhh ... Children ! I lost the word there . Children . Designed to supplant them , to help them end . Is that why you 've come ? To end the Avengers ? I 've come to save the world . But also ... yeah . We 'll move out right away . This is a start , but there 's something we need to begin the real work . All of these are ... Me . I have what the Avengers never will . Harmony . They 're discordant , disconnected . Stark 's already got them turning on each other . And when you get inside the rest of their heads ... Everyone 's plan is not to kill them . And make them martyrs ? You need patience . Need to see the big picture . I don 't see the big picture . I have a little picture . I take it out and look at it every day . You lost your parents in the bombings . I 've seen the records . - Their records are not the picture . - Pietro . No . Please . We were ten years old . Having dinner , the four of us . When the first shell hits , two floors below , it makes a hole in the floor ... it 's big . Our parents go in , and the whole building starts coming apart . I grab her , roll under the bed and the second shell hits . But , it doesn 't go off . It just sits there in the rubble , three feet from our faces . And on the side of the shell is painted one word ... Stark . We were trapped two days . Every effort to save us , every shift in the bricks , I think , " this will set if off . " We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us . I know what they are . I wondered why only you two survived Strucker 's experiments . Now I don 't . We will make it right . You and I can hurt them . But you will tear them apart . From the inside . He 's all over the globe ... robotics labs , weapons facilities , jet propulsion labs ... reports of a metal man , or men , coming in and emptying the place . - Fatalities ? - Only when engaged . Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories , worst fears , and something too fast to see . Maximoffs . Well , that makes sense he 'd go to them , they have someone in common . Not anymore . Negative . I answer to you . Yes , ma 'am . Barton . We might have something . Gotta go . Who was that ? Girlfriend . What 's this ? A message . Ultron killed Strucker . And he did a Banksy at the crime scene , just for us . This is a smokescreen . Why send a message when you 've just given a speech ? Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss . Yeah , I bet he yep . Everything we had on Strucker has been erased . Not everything . Known associates ... Well , Strucker had a lot of friends . Well , these people are all horrible . Wait . I know that guy . From back in the day . He operates off the African coast , black market arms . There are conventions , all right ? You meet people . I didn 't sell him anything . He was talking about finding something new , a game changer , it was all very " Ahab . " - This . - Uh , it 's a tattoo , I don 't think he had it ... No , those are tattoos , this is a brand . Oh , yeah . It 's a word in an African dialect meaning " thief . " In a much less friendly way . What dialect ? Wakanada ... ? W - , Wa - ... Wakanda . If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods ... I thought your father said he got the last of it ? I don 't follow . What comes out of Wakanda ? The strongest metal on earth . Where is this guy now ? ( African language ) Don 't tell me your man swindled you , I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts . Now , you will make it right , or the next missile I send you will come very much faster . Now , minister , where were we ? ( African language ) Shut up , shut up ! Yeah . The enhanced . Strucker 's prize pupils . Want a candy ? Oh , sorry to hear about Strucker . But then , he knew what kind of world he was helping create . Human life . Not a growth market . You ... you didn 't know ? Is this your first time ? Intimidating someone ? I 'm afraid that I 'm not that afraid . Everybody 's afraid of something . Cuttlefish . Deep sea fish . They make lights . Disco lights , " whoom ! whoom ! whoom ! " to hypnotize their prey , then they " whoom ! " I saw a documentary , it was terrifying . So if you 're going to fiddle with my brain , and make me see a giant cuttlefish , then I know you don 't do business , and I know you 're not in charge , and I only deal with the man in charge . There is no " man " in charge . Let 's talk business . Upon this rock I will build my church . Vibranium . You know , it came at great personal cost . It 's worth billions . Now , so are you . It 's all under your ... " dummy holdings ? " Finances , so weird . Well I always say , " keep your friends rich and your enemies rich and wait to find out which is which . " Stark . What ? Tony Stark used to say that . To me . You 're one of his ? What ? ! I 'm not ... ! I 'm not . You think I 'm one of Stark 's puppets , his hollow men ? I mean look at me , do I look like Iron Man ? Stark is ... I 'm sorry . I 'm s ... oooh . I 'm sure that 's gonna be okay , I 'm sorry . It 's just , I don 't understand . Don 't compare me with Stark ! It 's a thing with me . Stark is , he 's a sickness ! Ahh , Junior . You 're gonna break your old man 's heart . If I have to . - You don 't have to break anything . - Clearly you 've never made an omelet . He beat me by one second . Ah , this is funny , Mr. Stark . It 's what , comfortable ? - Like old times ? - This was never my life . You two can still walk away from this . Oh we will . I know you 've suffered . Blah ! Heh , heh , Captain America . God 's righteous man , pretending you could live without a war . I can 't physically throw up in my mouth , but ... If you believe in peace , then let us keep it . I think you 're confusing peace with quiet . Yuh-huh . What 's the Vibranium for ? I 'm glad you asked that , because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan ... ! - Shoot them ! - Which ones ? - All of them ! - Move , move , move ! Huh ! Ah ! Oh ! Stay down , kid ! It 's time for some mind games . Guys ? Is this a Code Green ? ( garbled feedback ) Thor ! Status ? The girl tried to warp my mind . Take special care , I doubt a human could keep her at bay . Fortunately , I am mighty . This is going very well . I 've done the whole mind control thing . Not a fan . Yeah , you better run . Who 's ever standing , we gotta move ! Guys ? Again . - You 'll break them . - Only the breakable ones . You are made of marble . We 'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony . What if I fail ? You never fail . Are you ready for our dance ? Is it him ? Is that the first son of Odin ? Heimdall , your eyes ! ? Oh , they see everything . They see you leading us to Hel . Wake up ! The war 's over , Steve . We can go home ! Imagine it ! - I can still save you . - We are all dead . Can you not see ? You 're a destroyer , Odinson . See where your power leads . Sloppy . Pretending to fail . The ceremony is necessary , for you to take your place in the world . - I have no place in the world . - Exactly . - What can I do ? - Ah , it hurts . - I 'm gonna kill him . I 'll be right back . - No . I 'm over it . I want ... I want to finish the plan . I want the big one . Ah ! The Vibranium 's getting away . And you 're not going anywhere . Of course not . I 'm already there . You 'll catch on . But first , you might need to catch Dr. Banner . News or footage , keyword : Hulk . Natasha , I could really use a lullaby . Well , that 's not gonna happen . Not for a while . The whole team is down . You got no back up here . I 'm calling in VERONICA . All units , all units ... - Need backup ! - Whoa ! Need backup ! You tell ' em ! Aah ! Run ! Run ! Raaar ! Get back ! Go ! Okay , move in , move in ! All right everybody , stand down ! You listening ? That little witch is messing with your mind . You 're stronger than her , you 're smarter than her , you 're Bruce Banner . Raaaar ! Right , right , right , don 't mention puny Banner . Okay . In the back ? Dick move , Banner . VERONICA , gimme a hand . Go to sleep , go to sleep , go to sleep ! Okay , pal , we 're gonna get you out of town . No , not that way , not that way ! C 'mon ! Bruce , you gotta work with me ! Everybody out ! Going to get ugly ! I 'm sorry . - Damage report . - ( bzzzt ) . - It 's comprehensive . Show me something . How quickly can we buy this building ? Go , move , move , move , move ! Raar ! Raaaar ! The news is loving you guys . Nobody else is . There 's been no official call for Banner 's arrest , but it 's in the air . Stark Relief Foundation ? Already on the scene . - How 's the team ? - Everyone 's ... we took a hit . - We 'll shake it off . - Well for now I 'd stay in stealth mode . And stay away from here . So , run and hide ? Until we can find Ultron , I don 't have a lot else to offer . Neither do we . Hey , you wanna switch out ? No , I 'm good . If you wanna get some kip , now 's a good time , ' cause there 's still a few hours out . A few hours from ... where ? A safe house . - What is this place ? - A safe house . Let 's hope . Honey . I 'm home . Hi . - Company . Sorry didn 't call ahead . - Hey . This is an agent of some kind . Gentleman , this is Laura . I know all your names . Oooh , incoming . - Ah ! - Dad ! - I see her ! Hey buddy ! How you guys doing ? Ooh ... - These are ... smaller agents . - ... look at your face ! - Oh my goodness ! - Did you bring Auntie Nat ? Why don 't you hug her and find out ? - Sorry for barging in on you . - Yeah , we woulda called ahead , but we were busy having no idea that you existed . Yeah , well Fury helped me set this up when I joined . He kept it off SHIELD 's files , I 'd like to keep it that way . - I figure it 's a good place to lay low . - Honey . Ah , I missed you . How 's little Natasha , huh ? She is Nathaniel . Traitor . ( chatter ) - Somebody 's getting bigger , huh ? - Somebody 's getting excited to have a new baby brother . - ( chatter continues ) Thor . I saw something in that dream . I need answers . I won 't find them here . We can go home . See you worried for nothing . Can 't even feel the difference , can you ? If they 're sleeping here , some of them are gonna have to double up . Heh heh heh . Yeah , that 's not gonna sell . What about Nat , and Dr. Banner ? How long has that been going on ? Has what ? Ha ha ha ! You are so cute . Nat and ... and Banner ? I 'll explain when you 're older . " Hawkeye . " Oh . Okay . It 's bad , right ? Nat seems really shaken . Ultron has these allies , these uh , kids , they 're punks really . They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit . Someone 's gonna have to teach ' em some manners . And that someone be you . You know I totally support your Avenging . I couldn 't be prouder . But I see those guys , those ... " gods , " You don 't think they need me . I think they do . Which is a lot scarier . They 're a mess . Yeah . I guess they 're my mess . You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back . Things are changing for us . In a few months time , you and me are gonna be outnumbered . I need ... Just be sure . Yes , ma 'am . I can feel the difference . ( speaking Korean ) Scream , and your entire staff dies . I could 've killed you , Helen , the night we met . I didn 't . Do you expect a thank you note ? I expect you to know why . The cradle . " This is the next thing , Tony . " This ... is the next me . The regeneration cradle prints tissue , it can 't build a living body . It can . You can . You lacked the materials . You 're a brilliant woman , Helen . But we all have room to improve . Oh . I didn 't realize you were waiting . I would 've joined you , but uh , it didn 't seem like the right time . They used up all the hot water . I should 've joined you . Missed our window . Did we ? The world just saw the Hulk . The real Hulk , for the first time . You know I have to leave . But you assume that I have to stay ? I had this , um , dream . The kind that seems normal at the time . - But when you wake ... - What did you dream ? That I was an Avenger . That I was anything more than the assassin they made me . I think you 're being harder on yourself . Here I was hoping that was your job . What are you doing ? I 'm running with it . With you . If running 's the plan , as far as you want . Are you out of your mind ? I want you to understand that I 'm ... Natasha . Where can I go ? Where in the world am I not a threat ? You 're not a threat to me . You sure ? Even if I didn 't just ... there 's no future with me . I can 't ever ... I can 't have this , kids , do the math , I physically can 't . Neither can I. In the Red Room , where I was trained , where I was raised , um , they have a graduation ceremony . They sterilize you . It 's efficient . One less thing to worry about . The one thing that might matter more than a mission . Makes everything easier . Even killing . You still think you 're the only monster on the team ? What , so we disappear ? Thor didn 't say where he was going for answers ? Sometimes my teammates don 't tell me things . I was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception . Yeah . Give him time . We don 't know what the Maximoff kid showed him . " Earth 's Mightiest Heroes . " Pulled us apart like cotton candy . Seems like you walked away all right . Is that a problem ? I don 't trust a guy without a dark side . Call me old fashioned . Well let 's just say you haven 't seen it yet . You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart , right ? Well I guess you 'd know . Whether you tell us is a bit of a question . - Banner and I were doing research . - That would affect the team . That would end the team . Isn 't that the mission ? Isn 't that the " why we fight , " so we can end the fight , so we get to go home ? Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts , innocent people die . Every time . I 'm sorry . Mr. Stark , uh , Clint said you wouldn 't mind , but , our tractor doesn 't seem to want to start at all . - I thought maybe you might ... - Yeah , I 'll give it a kick . Don 't take from my pile . Hello , dear . Tell me everything . What ails you ? Do me a favor . Try not to bring it to life . Ah , Mrs. Barton , you little minx . I get it , Maria Hill called you right ? Was she ever not working for you ? Artificial Intelligence . - You never even hesitated . - Look , it 's been a really long day , like , Eugene O 'Neill long , so how 's about we skip to the part where you 're useful ? Look me in the eye and tell me you 're going to shut him down . - You 're not the director of me . - I 'm not the director of anybody . I 'm just an old man , who cares very much about you . And I 'm the man who killed the Avengers . I saw it . I didn 't tell the team . How could I ? I saw them all dead , Nick . Felt it . The whole world , too . It 's because of me . I wasn 't ready . I didn 't do all I could . The Maximoff girl , she 's working you , Stark . - Playing on your fear . - I wasn 't tricked , I was shown . It wasn 't a nightmare , it was my legacy . The end of the path I started us on . You come up with some pretty impressive inventions , Tony . War isn 't one of them . I watched my friends die . You 'd think that 'd be as bad as it gets , right ? Pfft . Nope . Wasn 't the worst part . The worst part ... is that you didn 't . I 'll see you tonight . I like the look . If you 're going for inconspicuous , though , near miss . I need your help . It 's nice to be needed . It 's dangerous . I 'd be disappointed if it wasn 't . Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time . My contacts all say he 's building something . The amount of Vibranium he made off with , I don 't think it 's just one thing . What about Ultron himself ? Ah . He 's easy to track , he 's everywhere . Guy 's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit . Still doesn 't help us get an angle on any of his plans though . - He still going after launch codes ? - Yes , he is , but he 's not making any headway . I cracked the Pentagon 's firewall in high school on a dare . Yeah , well , I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that . - NEXUS ? - It 's the world internet hub in Oslo , every byte of data flows through there , fastest access on earth . So what 'd they say ? He 's fixated on the missiles . But the codes are constantly being changed . By whom ? Parties unknown . We have an ally ? Ultron 's got an enemy . That 's not the same thing . Still , I 'd pay folding money to know who it is . I might need to visit Oslo . Find our " unknown . " Well , this is good times , boss , but I was kind of hoping when I saw you , you 'd have more than that . I do . I have you . Back in the day , I had eyes everywhere , ears everywhere else . You kids had all the tech you could dream of . Here we all are , back on earth , with nothing but our wit , and our will to save the world . Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing between him and his mission . And whether or not he admits it , his mission is global destruction . All this , laid in a grave . So stand . Outwit the platinum bastard . Steve doesn 't like that kind of talk . You know what , Romanoff ? So what does he want ? To become better . Better than us . He keeps building bodies . Person bodies . The human form is inefficient , biologically speaking , we 're outmoded . But he keeps coming back to it . When you two programmed him to protect the human race , you amazingly failed . They don 't need to be protected . They need to evolve . - Ultron 's going to evolve . - How ? Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho ? It 's beautiful . The Vibranium atoms aren 't just compatible with the tissue cells , they 're binding them . And SHIELD never even thought ... The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a frisbee . Typical of humans . They scratch the surface and never think to look within . - I 'll take Natasha and Clint . - All right . Strictly recon . I 'll hit the NEXUS , I 'll join you as soon as I can . If Ultron is really building a body ... He 'll be more powerful than any of us . Maybe all of us . An android designed by a robot . You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me . I 'll drop Banner off at the tower . Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill ? She 's all yours . Apparently . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know . Something dramatic , I hope . I 'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back . Yeah , then you 'll find another part of the house to tear apart . No . It 's the last project . I Promise . This is it . The Water of Sight . In every realm , there 's a reflection . If the water spirits accept me , I can return to my dream , and find what I missed . The men who enter that water ... the legends don 't end well . A hacker who 's faster than Ultron ? He could be anywhere . And as this is the center of everything , I 'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world 's biggest haystack . How do you find it ? Pretty simple . You bring a magnet . ( sings ) Oh , I 'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don 't want me to . Come and get me . Wake up ! Thor ! Extinction . Cellular cohesion will take a few hours , but we can initiate the consciousness stream . We 're uploading your cerebral matrix ... now . I can read him . He is dreaming . I wouldn 't call it dreams . It 's Ultron 's base consciousness . Informational noise . Soon ... How soon ? I 'm not being pushy . We 're imprinting a physical brain . There are no shortcuts . Even if you imagined ... Aaah ! He ... - How could you ? - How could I what ? You said we would destroy the Avengers . - Make a better world . - It will be better . - When everyone is dead . - That is not ... ! The human race will have every opportunity to improve . And if they don 't ? Ask Noah . You 're a madman . There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs . When the Earth starts to settle , God throws a stone at it , and believe me , he 's winding up . We have to evolve . There 's no room for the weak . And who decides who 's weak ? Life . Life always decides . There 's incoming . The Quinjet . We have to move . That 's not a problem . Uh , wait , guys ! I ... They don 't understand . When they see , they 'll understand . I just need a little more ... time . Two minutes . Stay close . Dr. Cho ! He 's uploading himself into the body . Where ? The real power is inside the cradle . The gem . Its power is uncontainable . You can 't just blow it up . You have to get the cradle to Stark . First I have to find it . Go . - Did you guys copy that ? - We did . I got a private jet taking off , across town , no manifest . That could be him . There . It 's the truck from the lab . Right above you , Cap . On the loop by the bridge . It 's them . I got three with the cradle , one in the cab . I could take out the driver . Negative ! If that truck crashes , the gem could level the city . We need to draw out Ultron . No , no no no no . Leave me alone ! Well he 's definitely unhappy ! I 'm gonna try and keep him that way . You 're not a match for him , Cap . Thanks , Barton . You know what 's in that cradle ? The power to make real change . And that terrifies you . I wouldn 't call it a comfort . Stop it ! We got a window . 4 , 3 ... Give ' em hell . I 'm always picking up after you boys . They 're heading under the overpass , I 've got no shot . Which way ? Hard right ... Now . Out of the way ! Coming through ! Sorry , coming through ! Come on ! Clint ! Can you draw out the guards ? Let 's find out . Beep beep ! ( Korean language ) They 're heading back towards you . So whatever you 're going to do , do it now . I 'm going in . Cap , can you keep him occupied ? What do you think I 've been doing ? A package is airborne . I have a clean shot . - Negative . I am still in the truck . - What the hell are you ... Just be ready , I 'm sending the package to you . How do you want me to take it ? Uhh , you might wish you hadn 't asked that . Please . Don 't do this . What choice do we have ? I lost him ! He 's heading your way ! Nat , we gotta go . - Clint ! - Nat ! Cap , you see Nat ? If you have the package , get it to Stark ! Go ! - Do you have eyes on Nat ? - Go ! Civilians in our path . Can you stop this thing ? I 'm fine . I just need to take a minute . I 'm very tempted not to give you one . The cradle . Did you get it ? Stark 'll take care of it . No , he won 't . You don 't know what you 're talking about , Stark 's not crazy . He will do anything to make things right . Stark , come in . Stark . Anyone on comms ? Ultron can 't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it . Where do you think he gets that ? Anything on Nat ? Haven 't heard . But she 's alive , or Ultron 'd be rubbing our faces in it . - This is sealed tight . - We 're going to need to access the program , break it down from within . Any chance Natasha might leave you a message , outside the internet , old school spy stuff ? There 's some nets I can cast . Yeah , all right . I 'll find her . I can work on tissue degeneration , if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted . Yeah , about that . No . - You have to trust me . - Kinda don 't . Our ally ? The guy protecting the military 's nuclear codes ? I found him . Hello , Dr. Banner . Ultron didn 't go after Jarvis ' cause he was angry . He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do . So Jarvis went underground . Okay , scattered , dumped his memory . But not his protocols . He didn 't even know he was in there , until I pieced him together . So , you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing ? No , of course not ! I want to help you put Jarvis in this thing . We 're out of my field here . You know bio-organics better than anyone . And you just assume that Jarvis 's operational matrix can beat Ultron 's ? Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it . This is the opportunity , we can create Ultron 's perfect self , without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality . - We have to . - I believe it 's worth a go . No . I 'm in a loop . I 'm caught in a time loop , this is exactly where it all went wrong . I know , I know . I know what everyone 's going to say , but they 're already saying it . We 're mad scientists . We 're monsters , buddy . You gotta own it . Make a stand . It 's not a loop . It 's the end of the line . I was unsure you 'd wake up . I hoped you would , I wanted to show you . I don 't have anyone else . I think a lot about meteors , the purity of them . " Boom ! " , the end , start again . The world made clean for the new man to rebuild . I was meant to be new . I was meant to be beautiful . The world would 've looked to the sky and seen hope , seen mercy . Instead they 'll look up in horror because of you . You 've wounded me . I give you full marks for that . But , like the man said , " What doesn 't kill me just makes me stronger ! " This framework is not compatible . The genetic coding tower 's at 97 percent . You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes . I 'm gonna say this once . How about " nonce " ? Shut it down . Nope . Not gonna happen . - You don 't know what you 're doing . - And you do ? She 's not in your head ? - I know you 're angry . - No , we 're way past that . I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade . Banner , after everything that 's happened ... - That 's nothing compared to what 's coming . - You don 't know what 's in there . The creature ... - This isn 't a game . No , no . Go on . You were saying ? Pietro ! What ? You didn 't see that coming ? I 'm re-routing the upload . Go ahead . Piss me off . Wait ! I 'm sorry . That was odd . Thank you . Thor . You helped create this ? I 've had a vision . A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it 's center is that . What , the gem ? It 's the Mind Stone . It 's one of the six Infinity Stones , the greatest power in the universe , unparalleled in its destructive capabilities . - Then why would you bring it to ... - Because Stark is right . Oh , it 's definitely the end times . - The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron . - Not alone . Why does your " vision " sound like Jarvis ? We reconfigured Jarvis ' matrix to create something new . I think I 've had my fill of new . - You think I 'm a child of Ultron ? - You 're not ? I 'm not Ultron . I 'm not Jarvis . I am ... I am . I looked in your head and saw annihilation . Look again . Yeah . Her seal of approval means jack to me . Their powers . The horrors in our heads . Ultron himself . They all came from the Mind Stone , and they 're nothing compared to what it can unleash . But with it on our side ... Is it ? Are you ? On our side ? I don 't think it 's that simple . Well it better get real simple real soon . I 'm on the side of life . Ultron isn 't . He will end it all . - What 's he waiting for ? - You . - Where ? - Sokovia . He 's got Nat there too . If we 're wrong about you if you 're the monster that Ultron made you to be ... What will you do ? I don 't want to kill Ultron . He 's unique . And he 's in pain . But that pain will roll over the earth , so he must be destroyed . Every form he 's built , every trace of his presence on the ' net , we have to act now . And not one of us can do it without the others . Maybe I am a monster . I don 't think I 'd know if I were one . I 'm not what you are . And not what you intended . So there may be no way to make you trust me . But we need to go . Right . Well done . Three minutes . Get what you need . Good evening , boss . No way we all get through this . If even one tin soldier is left standing , we 've lost . - It 's gonna be blood on the floor . - I got no plans tomorrow night . I get first crack at the big guy . Iron Man 's the one he 's waiting for . That 's true , he hates you the most . Ultron knows we 're coming . Odds are we 'll be riding into heavy fire . And that 's what we signed up for . But the people of Sokovia , they didn 't . So our priority is getting them out . We 're under attack . Clear the city , now . Get off your asses . All they want is to live their lives in peace . And that 's not going to happen today . But we can do our best to protect them . And we can get the job done . We find out what Ultron 's been building . We find Romanoff , and we clear the field . Keep the fight between us . Ultron thinks we 're monsters and we 're what 's wrong with the world . This isn 't just about beating him . It 's about whether he 's right . Natasha ! Natasha ! Bruce ? You all right ? Yeah . The team 's in the city , it 's about to light up . I don 't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere ? Yeah . I did . So what 's our play ? - I 'm here to get you to safety . - Job 's not finished . We could help with the evacuation , but I can 't be in a fight near civilians . And you 've done plenty . Our fight is over . So we just disappear ? Come on . Your man 's in the church , boss . I think he 's waiting for you . Come to confess your sins ? I don 't know , how much time you got ? More than you . Uhhh . Have you been juicing ? On a Vibranium cocktail ? You 're looking ... I don 't wanna say , puffy ... You 're stalling to protect the people . Well , that is the mission . Did you forget ? I 've moved beyond your mission . I 'm free . What , you think you 're the only one stalling ? There 's the rest of the Vibranium . Function : still unclear . This is how you end , Tony . This is peace in my time . Go ! Get off the bridge ! Run ! Ultron ! My Vision . They really did take everything from me . - You set the terms , you can change them . - All right . Ahhh ! FRIDAY ! The Vision ? Boss , it 's working . He 's burning Ultron out of the ' net , he won 't escape through there . You shut me out ! You think I care ? You take away my world , I take away yours . Whoa ! What 's this ? Run ! Get back , get back ! - FRIDAY ? - Sokovia 's going for a ride . Do you see ? The beauty of it . The inevitability . You rise , only to fall . You , Avengers , you are my meteor , my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure . Purge me from your computers , turn my own flesh against me . It means nothing . When the dust settles , the only thing living in this world will be metal . We gotta move . You 're not going to turn green ? I 've got a compelling reason to not lose my cool . I adore you . But I need the other guy . Let 's finish the job . - I really hope this makes us even . - ( grunt ) - Now go be a hero . - Raaar ! The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field , that 's what 's keeping the rock together . - If it drops ? - Right now the impact would kill thousands . Once it gets high enough global extinction . That building 's not clear , its tenth floor . Hi . Okay . Get in the tub ! I got airborne , heading up to the bridge . Cap , you got incoming . Incoming already came in . Stark , you worry about bringing the city back down safely . The rest of us have one job : tear these things apart . You get hurt , hurt ' em back . You get killed , walk it off . Go , go , move ! How could I let this happen ? Hey , hey , you okay ? This is all our fault . Hey , look at me . It 's your fault , it 's everyone 's fault , who cares . Are you up for this ? Are you ? Look , I just need to know , ' cause the city i - , is flying . Okay , look , the city is flying , we 're fighting an army of robots , and I have a bow and arrow . None of this makes sense . But I 'm going back out there because of my job . Okay ? And I can 't do my job and babysit . It doesn 't matter what you did , or what you were . If you go out there , you fight , and you fight to kill . Stay in here , you 're good , I 'll send your brother to come find you , but if you step out that door , you are an Avenger . All right , good chat . Yeah , the city is flying . I got you ! Just look at me . You can 't save them all . You 'll never ... " You 'll never " what ? You didn 't finish ! What , were you napping ? Thor ! You are bothering me . Ow ! Uh ... - All right , we 're all clear here . - We are not clear ! We are very not clear ! All right , coming to you . Keep up , old man . Nobody would know . Nobody . Yeah , last I saw him , and Ultron was sitting on him , uh ... yeah , he 'll be missed , that quick little bastard . I miss him already . Hold your fire ! Romanoff ! Thanks . The anti-gravs are rigged to flip . Touch ' em , they 'll go full reverse thrust . The city 's not coming down slow . The spire 's Vibranium . If I get Thor to hit it ... It 'll crack , but that 's not enough , the impact would still be devastating . Maybe if we could cap the other end , keep the atomic action doubling back . That could vaporize the city . And everyone on it . The next wave 's gonna hit any minute . What have you got , Stark ? Well , nothing great . Maybe a way to blow up the city . That 'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear . I asked for a solution , not an escape plan . Impact radius is getting bigger every second . We 're going to have to make a choice . Cap , these people are going nowhere . If Stark finds a way to blow this rock ... Not ' til everyone 's safe . Everyone up here versus everyone down there ? There 's no math there . I 'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it . I didn 't say we should leave . There 's worse ways to go . Where else am I gonna get a view like this ? Glad you like the view , Romanoff . It 's about to get better . Nice , right ? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends . She 's dusty , but she 'll do . Fury , you son of a bitch . Oooh ! You kiss your mother with that mouth ? Altitude is 18,000 and climbing . Lifeboats secure to deploy . Disengage in 3 , 2 ... take ' em out . This is SHIELD ? This is what SHIELD 's supposed to be . This is not so bad . Let 's load ' em up . Sir , we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank . Show ' em what we got . You 're up . Yes ! Now this is gonna be a good story . Yup . If you live to tell it . You think I can 't hold my own ? We get through this , I 'll hold your own . You had to make it weird . Donovan ! I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group . All right , let 's go ! All right , here we go . Here we go , let 's move . Let 's go everyone ! Number six boat is topped and locked . Or , uh , or stocked , topped , it ... it 's uh , full of people . Incoming ! Oh , God ! You think you 're saving anyone ? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it 's still billions dead . Even you can 't stop that . I am Thor , son of Odin , and as long as there is life in my breast , I am ... running out of things to say ! Are you ready ? It 's terribly well balanced . Well , if there 's too much weight , you lose power on the swing , so . I got it ! Create a heat seal . I can ... - I can supercharge the spire from below . - Running numbers . - A heat seal could work with enough power . - Thor , I got a plan ! We 're out of time . They 're coming for the core . - Rhodey , get the rest of the people on board that carrier . - On it . Avengers , time to work for a living . - You good ? - Yeah . Romanoff ? You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini . Relax , Shell-head . Not all of us can fly . - What 's the drill ? - This is the drill . If Ultron gets a hand on the core , we lose . Is that the best you can do ? You had to ask . This is the best I can do . This is exactly what I wanted . All of you against all of me . How can you possibly hope to stop me ? Like the old man said . Together . Raaarrrr ! Uhh ! You know , with the benefit of hindsight ... . Rarrrr ! They 'll try to leave the city . We can 't let ' em , not even one . Rhodey ! I 'm on it . Oh no , I didn 't say you could leave . War Machine , comin ' at you , right a - ... Okay , what ? We gotta move out . Even I can tell the air is getting thin . You guys get to the boats ... I 'll sweep for stragglers , be right behind you . What about the core ? I 'll protect it . It 's my job . Nat . Let 's go . - Get the people on the boats . - I 'm not going to leave you . - I can handle these . Come back for me when everyone else is off , not before . - Mmm . - You understand ? You know , I 'm 12 minutes older than you . Heh . Go . - Boss , power levels are way below ... - Re-route everything . We 've got one shot at this . I know what I need to do . The dining room ! If I knock out that east wall , it 'll make a nice work space for Laura , huh . Put up some baffling , she can 't hear the kids running around , what do you think ? You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway . No one eats in a dining room . Raarrrr ! We don 't have a lot of time . So get your ass on a boat . Hey big guy . Sun 's getting real low . You 're safe now . It 'll be okay , buckle up secure your gear , find a seat ... Costel ? We were in the market . Costel ? ! Thor , I 'm gonna need you back in the church . - Is this the last of them ? - Yeah . Everyone else is on the carrier . - Y 'know , if this works , we maybe don 't walk away . - Maybe not . ( singing ) I have no strings , so I have fun . I 'm not tied up to anyone . C 'mon , I 'll help you up . You didn 't see that coming . Oh , for god 's sake ... ! Costel ! No , no . I 'm fine . But it 's been a long day . Wanda . If you stay here , you 'll die . I just did . Do you know how it felt ? It felt like that . Thor , on my mark . Now ! Hey big guy . We did it . The job 's finished . Now I need you to turn this bird around , okay ? We can 't track you in stealth mode , so help me out . I need you t ... Oh , dear . You 're afraid . - Of you ? - Of death . You 're the last one . You were supposed to be the last . Stark asked for a savior , and settled for a slave . I suppose we 're both disappointments . Ha ha ha ha . I suppose we are . Humans are odd . They think order and chaos are somehow opposites , and try to control what won 't be . But there is grace in their failings . I think you missed that . They 're doomed . Yes . But a thing isn 't beautiful because it lasts . It 's a privilege to be among them . You 're unbearably naive . Well , I was born yesterday . ( chatter ) Say hi to Auntie Nat . Fat . One of our tech boys flagged this , splashed down in the Banda Sea , could be the Quinjet . But with Stark 's stealth tech , we still can 't track the damn thing . Right . Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji . He 'll send a postcard . " Wish you were here . " You sent me to recruit him , way back when . Did you know then what was going to happen ? You never know . You hope for the best and make do with what you get . I got a great team . Nothing lasts forever . Trouble , Ms. Romanoff . No matter who wins or loses , trouble still comes ' round . - The rules have changed . - We 're dealing with something new . - Well , the Vision 's artificial intelligence . - A machine . - So it doesn 't count . - No . It 's not , like , a person lifting the hammer . - Right . Different rules for us . - Nice guy . But artificial . - Thank you . If he can wield the hammer , he can keep the Mind Stone . It 's safe with the Vision . And these days , safe is in short supply . - But if you put the hammer in an elevator ... - It would still go up . - Elevator 's not worthy . I 'm going to miss these little talks of ours . Not if you don 't leave . I have no choice . The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years . That 's not a coincidence . Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us . - Once all these pieces are in position ... - Triple Yahtzee ? You think you can find out what 's coming ? I do . Besides this one , there 's nothing that can 't be explained . That man has no regard for lawn maintenance . I 'm gonna miss him though . And you 're gonna miss me . There 's gonna be a lot of manful tears . I will miss you , Tony . Yeah ? Well , it 's time for me to tap out . Maybe I should take a page out of Barton 's book and build Pepper a farm . Hope nobody blows it up . The simple life . You 'll get there one day . I don 't know . Family , stability . The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago . I think someone else came out . You all right ? I 'm home . You want to keep staring at the wall , or do you want to go to work ? I mean , it 's a pretty interesting wall . I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other 's eyes . How do we look ? - Well , we 're not the ' 27 Yankees . - We 've got some hitters . - They 're good . They 're not a team . - Let 's beat ' em into shape . Avengers ... ! SPOILER COMING UP - MID-CREDIT STINGER SCENE ( missing from this video ) - A gold glove is shown stored inside a vault ; the door to the vault opens . Thanos puts his left hand into the gauntlet and raises it with a fist . He says , " Fine . I 'll do it myself . " The gauntlet has 6 empty receptacles ( 5 knuckles 1 back of the hand ) , presumably for Infinity Stones to be placed into in future movies .

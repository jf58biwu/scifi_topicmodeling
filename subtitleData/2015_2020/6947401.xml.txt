I mean , if it were new , we would have heard about a release or something , right ? There 's always ads , previews , and junk . I bet it 's a beta . A what now ? When they make a new game , sometimes they place a prototype into the wild , you know , see what the kids think . They call it a beta . A game so new it 's not even out yet .

Andrew , wait ! Andrew . The parents of a high school boy were shocked by the mysterious death of their 14yearold son , found deceased early this morning . Melvin Raimi of Jefferson High was discovered in the basement of his parents Beaverton Court home . No details as to the cause of death have been released at this time . A source close to the family detailed the scene as " beyond description . " More on this tragic incident , soon . Ew ! I have a surprise for that barf bag where 's his locker ? No , Amy , please just leave it alone , okay ? No way , after what he did ? You don 't know the whole story . Andrew , he called you ... an FAG . You don 't call people that , it 's mean . Especially if they 're Especially if they 're what ? If they 're ... different . Listen . Where are you from , again ? San Diego . Well , originally Boston by way of Chattanooga . Okay , well , you 're in Beaverton now , right , and being different in Beaverton gets you killed . Believe it or not , Kill Screen , I kinda know a lot about being different . I 'm just saying we 're friends now , you can talk to me , even share secrets . Look , you don 't even know me , okay ? You don 't know the first thing about me . But I 'm not different . You 're not my friend . Keep your head down , keep to yourself , and if someone calls me an FAG , do us both a favor and leave me the hell alone . What 's going on in there ? Just saying my prayers . Well , it 's bedtime , get to sleep . Yes sir , goodnight . Dad ? Hello ? Hey , Myers . See you in gym class , dweeb . All right , everyone , quit your dillydallying . Get in the showers . Um ... I ... just , freshening up , um , I ... Shower . Yeah . Shower Yeah . Hop in , frosh . Water 's fine . Myers , don 't leave me , Myers . Excuse me , Detective ? I think I might know something about what 's happened . Tell us what you know , son . This is gonna sound weird , but there 's a strange video game at Wilma 's Arcade . It 's called Polybius , it might be a beta , that 's besides the point , um ... Look , there 's this weird symbol , right ? And ... the nightmares ... Okay , just lemme back up . There 's this monster , see . Slow down . What 's your name ? Um , Andrew Myers . Well , Andrew Myers , I 'm gonna make you my junior detective , okay ? Take this notebook , write down all your scary video game nightmares into that book , then you hand it to MeeMaw and PawPaw and you let them handle it . I 'm not making any of this up . Myers , come on , let 's go . It 's a crime scene , okay ? Go on , buddy . God . Run on home now . Excuse me . Did I hear that right ? Did you play a game called Polybius ? You gonna make fun of me too ? Who else have you told ? Just him , and now you , I guess . Do you know anyone else that 's played the game ? What 's going on ? Why don 't you come with me , Andrew , and we 'll talk about Polybius . Who are you ? You ... obviously like video games , right ? Well , we 've got all the best ones . PacMan , Missile Attack , Mr. Frog . Maybe even a few you 've never heard of . Come with me . I 've got a whole roll of quarters in the car . Bedtime , buddy . Say your prayers and hit the hay . Okay . I don 't hear you praying . Now I lay me down to sleep , I pray the Lord my soul to keep . If I die before I wake , I pray the Lord ... my soul to take . It appears the case is an isolated incident and has no connection with the discovery of Melvin Raimi , found deceased earlier this morning . Authorities are urging witnesses or anyone with knowledge of the crime to come forth and contact the county sheriff 's department . Now , on to Sports . Quittin ' time , Amy . Come on , just one more ! All righty , Amy , come on . Okay , okaywait a second . Come on , it 's time to go . Hey . Um , sir ? I 'm sorry , but we 're closed . Andrew ? It 's not just a game . Andrew , that 's just ... it 's just crazy , man . Is it ? Jesus , you too ? I was trying to knock FAG off the highscore board . I played last night till I ran out of quarters , had a bad dream , and I woke up , and this was on my tummy , I I thought it was a rash . I get those . In the shape of the symbol from the game ? Come on . No , it 's gotta be just a coincidence , man . What about the guy in the suit ? Probably a child molester . That 's a relief . What are you trying to say , man , that that these guys are going after and killing everyone that 's played the game ? What I 'm trying to say is , I think it is the game . In the Revelations of Ezekiel , one of the lost books of the Bible , there 's a story about an angel named Polybius . He was like a heavenly muse . He inspired artists to create works of beauty in the Lord 's name . Songs , paintings , stuff like that . But God got all the credit for the work . So one day , a jealous Polybius inspired someone to do a painting on him instead . When God found out , He branded him with the mark of death and cast him out . That 's just crazy , man . According to lore , he 's still out there , wandering the fiery maze of hell for all of eternity . His only remaining power is to possess the artists of Earth . Here , listen . " And woe be to all who listen . " The foul works made in his name , for by night , Polybius shall brand their flesh " and cast their souls into hell . " Polybius is real . Okay , somehow , that thing got into the game , and we played it , right ? So we 're marked . We 've been cursed . Tonight , he 'll come for us and try to claim our souls . I mean , that 's just stupid . The marks , the monster , " your souls are mine " ? Hell , even that guy , the ... child molester ! He kept talking about video games like he knows something . It 's stupid , it 's clearly a government experiment . And that 's impossible . Makes more sense than demons . Guys ? It 's just , it 's lt 's . It 's alive . My God . Look , there 's obviously something strange going on in Beaverton . I think the bodies of Dennis and Headgear Kid prove that much . If I 'm right and it is this game , we need to figure out where it came from and get some answers . And what if we can 't ? Then we might not make it through the night . But if that 's the case , we do what I always do . We run like hell . Your souls are mine ! All right , I 'm gonna go check Wilma 's back office , see if I can dig anything up on this thing . I 'll start with Bits ' N Blips . Just see if you can find any mention of Polybius . So . Crazy day ? Yeah . Hey , and about this morning , I 'm sorry , I was being a huge jerk . I was being nosy . I kind of have a problem with that , so . I 'm sorry I lashed out . Cool beans ? Cool beans . Hand hug ! For what it 's worth , though ... I think you guys would make a really cute couple . I don 'tI don 't know what you 're talking about . Okay then . You think that he might be Have you asked him ? Of course not ! I don 't ... He sorts your mail , Andrew . Maybe you should go see if he needs some ... help ? Yeah , go see if he needs some ... all right . Yeah . Scream if you need me . Hey , Jess ! Jess ? Jess ? Jess ! Jess , is that you ? Wilma ! Hey . She 's sleeping . Whatwhat are you doing ? Wilma keeps everything in here . So if we can trace the cabinet back to a name or an address , then Why don 't we just ask her ? No , no , no ! Trust me . You do not want to wake that woman up . Come on , help me look . Did you know Wilma ran a laundrymat in Austin ? Portland , Albuquerque , Detroit ... man . She 's been everywhere . Makes you wonder how she ended up in a dump like this . If I actually die in Beaverton ... Okay , dude ; We get it . Beaverton blows . Listen , I 'm not trying to say that I like this town any more than you , but ... instead of wanting to be somewhere else all the time , why don 't you just try being here ? What 's so great about being here ? I don 't know , your friends ? Amy ? Me ? Look . I 'm not bound for greatness , like you . 'Kay , I 'm a Dstudent on a good day at best . Jess But the point is , I don 't let it anchor me down . I live life in the moment , you know ? That 's very Yoda of you . Try it sometime , you should ! Whoa ! What are you doing ? I ... living in the moment ? Look , I 'm sorry , dude , I just thought that . Youyou thought what ? Psst ! You guys ! Damn ! That 's the guy ! He must have followed me from school . We should bail . And go where ? It 's not like we actually still know what 's goin ' on . That guy knows something . I bet my allowance on it . Why don 't you walk up and ask ? Can I ask you a few questions ? I can 't believe that actually worked . No wallet , no ID , nothing . He 's a spy . See if he has fingerprints . He has fingerprints , Amy . Switch to decaf . Hey , guys , look what I found in this trunk . Put that down ! It all makes sense . This is some Black Ops MKUltra thing . What are you talking about ? The CIA mind control program ? They gave people LSD and filmed them dorking hookers and stuff . You 're saying the CIA or the MKUltrons or whoever made a mindcontrolling video game that kills people and they left it here at Wilma 's . In Beaverton . You should run , children . It won 't save you , but it might just buy you some time . It 's the game , right ? How do we stop it ? No , that 's not how this is played . You 're already dead . There has to be a way . If there is , let me know . I 'll put it in my report . My ... guys , you 're gonna want to look at this . Look here . Sunnyvale , California , summer 1978 . 17 were found dead at Sinnesloschen Software . " Documents recovered at the scene reference " a new game prototype , " Polybius . " July 1979 . It was found at a movie theater in Colorado Springs . Eight confirmed dead . Then in a laundrymat in Seattle , 1982 . " Agency commences Level 5 blackout . " My God . He doesn 't even know what it is . He 's just cleaning up its mess , sweeping it under the rug . Why are you doing this ? Because some things are beyond comprehension . They cannot be stopped nor controlled . The only way people can sleep at night is if they can pretend they didn 't exist . My colleagues and I facilitate this process by any means necessary . Well , if they didn 't build it , then who did ? No way . Now , will you let me go . Our souls are his . Now yousit . Wilma , please , just put . Shut up ! He 'll be here soon . I can 't let you leave . If I let you leave , he comes Who ? Who 's coming ? It 's not my fault . It 's just a game . How was I supposed to know it was gonna hurt people ? Wilma , please , you don 't have to . You were there , at Sinnesloschen . You helped them create the game , didn 't you ? Back in 1978 . I was the best programmer they had in that shithole of a place . You 've heard of Rabbit Run ? That was mine . Xenoblaster too . Did I get any credit , no . Sometimes , ideas just pop into your head . They come from someplace , some ... other dimension . A little voice whispered in my ear . Polybius . It used me to make itself . I just set it free . And now what ? You 're feeding it . Sunnyvale , Portland ? You take it from place to place so it can kill . I 'm sorry . I really am . But I 've seen what he does to people and I 'm not gonna let that happen to me . We have an understanding . You 're a real bitch , lady . Come to me . No ! He 's here . My baby . No ! No ! No ! Leave my friend alone , you ugly piece of . No , Amy , no ! No ! No , Amy ! Hey , asshole ! Amy ! Come on ! Amy ! Come on , we have to go ! She 's gone ! Amy ! Andrew , we gotta go ! She 's gone , let 's go ! Amy ! Let 's go ! Come on , go , go ! Jess , Jess ! Come on , let 's go ! Go where ? As far away from that thing as we can get . It 's just gonna catch up to us . Well , then we 'll go somewhere else . I can 't , Jess , I 'm done running . Well , then you 're gonna end up just like Amy . We are like Amy . She 's dead , Jess . And so is the next poor chump in the next hick town that Wilma goes to , unless we put a stop to it . But it 's suicide , man ! Then we 're dead either way . You 're right . Live in the moment , it 's what you said . This moment , Jess . Together , we can . If you wanna get yourself killed , then go right ahead . But you 're on your own . I love you , Jess . And I know you don 't feel the same way about me and that 's fine . But I 'm tired of hiding . From who I am , from everything . I don 't know what 's gonna happen when I go back in there , but whatever it is , it 's better than what I 've been living . Please don 't make me face it alone . I 'm sorry . But Jess ! I 'm in the game . Okay , let 's get this over with . Your souls are mine . Jess ! You came back . I thought about what you said , okay ? You were right . You gotta live in the moment , man , I 'm through running . I 'm through with . Holy shit , it 's the monster , man ! Yeah , no shit , dude , did you come with a plan ? Not exactly . Well , the cabinet 's indestructible , we 've gotta find another way . You better think fast , any bright ideas ? No , but I just came up with a really stupid one . We don 't destroy the cabinet , we destroy the game . Rack up enough points , crash the program , a kill screen . Quarters , I need quarters , come on ! It 's my last one . Make it count . Hey , ugly ! Come and get me . Come on ! Come get some ! Over here ! Come on , man ! Shit , no , no , no , no , no . No ! No , no , no ! No ! No ! Andrew ! Andrew , he 's coming for you ! Yes , yes , come on ! No ! Amy ! Hit the bricks , Wilma . You okay ? Yeah . Let 's get the hell outta here . Geez , the way you dips are acting , you 'd think I died or something . You know what ? Beaverton sucks . I was actually gonna say it 's growing on me . Do you guys wanna play some video games ? No ! No ! You sure ? Yes ! " Polybius . " A review by Andrew Myers . Life is a lot like maze games . They 're cruel , they 're hard ... and no matter what , you die . Now , given all that , you have two basic options . You can live in fear , hide in the shadows , and die anyway , or you can stop trying to survive your life and start trying to live it . It 's not the easier choice , especially if being yourself means being different . But it 's worth it . In your darkest moments , when you 're most afraid , just remember the two commandments . Keep thy chin up , and fight like hell .

 [ NARRATOR ] Previously on Dark Matter . [ ONE ] We all woke up just like you , no idea who we are or how we got here . [ TWO ] You said someone was responsible for wiping our memories . [ FIVE ] No , not me , I-it was someone else . It 's like I 'm remembering it for them . I might be able to adapt some of the medical equipment to work as a kind of mind probe . [ TWO ] And whose mind would we be probing ? [ FIVE ] Mine . [ JACE ] So , who the hell is Ms. Maplethorpe , anyway ? She was a teacher I had when I was a kid . It 's as good a code as any . [ JACE talks indistinctly ] ... Maplethorpe , anyway ? [ JACE ] Who the hell is Ms. Maplethorpe , anyway ? [ GRIFFIN ] It 's as good a code as any . I know I 'll never forget it . [ FIVE ] I know it ! I know the code ! I know the code ! It 's Maplethorpe ! [ knocking ] [ TWO ] It 's open . I can come back . No , it 's okay . [ ONE ] Uhh .. [ TWO ] What do you want ? [ ONE ] Uhh , status report . [ TWO ] What 's your status ? Urn , I 'm fine , thanks , but I was talking about the ship . [ TWO ] What about it ? Well , umm , apparently all systems are operating below optimal levels . [ TWO ] The Android 's on top of it . Also , our food stores are down to four days and our water levels have dropped . [ TWO sighs ] I do love my long showers . Umm , she 's working on shoring up the recycling system . I told her if it means drinking other people 's urine than I 'd rather die of dehydration . You 're fine with drinking your own though ? [ ONE ] Gotta draw the line somewhere . Look , the , uhh , the bottom line is ... she 's doing the best she can , but this bucket needs more work than one android can handle . [ TWO ] Yeah ... You can turn around now . Anything else ? Uhh , yeah , we have a damaged relationship . Do we ? If it gets any worse we 're gonna have to shut it down . A damaged relationship ? Relay switch . I said relay switch . No , you didn 't . [ ONE ] I think you heard me wrong . There 's a relay switch on the lower level that 's been- - [ TWO ] Look , the ship is in a state of disrepair and we can 't afford to fix it . There 's no news there . Why don 't we just be honest with each other ? You 're not here to give me a status report . Why do you think I 'm here ? To get a status report . Wh ... What makes you say that ? [ ONE ] All right , yes , you and Three have been acting pretty distant towards each other lately . And if you want my opinion , you can do better than him . [ TWO ] He has at least one redeeming quality . I think it 's just easy for you not to get emotionally attached . What makes you say that ? [ ONE ] Because I can 't imagine anyone getting emotionally attached to him . Oh , you think I couldn 't help myself with you because you 're so hopelessly irresistible ? I didn 't- - I 'm not- - I- - . [ TWO ] Status is , it 's over . [ ONE ] You and Three ? What happened ? He didn 't like all the names I was calling him during sex . Is that what this is about ? What ? You flirting with me ? For your information , if I was flirting with you , I would be taking my clothes off , not putting them on . [ TWO ] What are you doing ? What , I thought- - You thought wrong . But if " ? [ TWO ] No , it 's ... complicated . [ ONE sighs ] Right . And also ... that . Don 't stop on my account . Did you need anything ? Five figured out the code to the mystery room . You 're kidding . And we 're about to open it . But if you two have something better to do . No . [ THREE ] That 's it ? I think that 's as open as they 're gonna get . [ SIX ] Why is everything on this ship so much work ? [ TWO ] Clear . The panel appears to be malfunctioning . Of course it is . [ THE ANDROID ] Give me a moment . [ SIX laughs ] [ THREE ] Whoa-ho-ho ! [ THREE ] All right ! I 'm gonna call you " Racquel . " [ ONE ] All these are locked ... Ah , just stand aside . See if I can 't fix that . Don 't be stupid . You don 't know what 's in there . Could be packed with explosives . [ SIX ] You know , anyone else wondering why you need to lock a box that 's inside a locked room ? [ TWO ] Could be something that we stole that we just haven 't gotten around to opening yet . Hey , anybody know what this is ? [ ALL ] Whoa , whoa ! Hey ! What ? I suggest you be careful not to activate it . [ FIVE ] Oh . [ TWO chuckles ] [ TWO ] Well , I know what this is . [ THREE ] We are rich ! - -Hoo-hoo-hoo ! Oh yeah ! - - [ TWO chuckles ] Uh , guys ? She 's alive . [ TWO ] The pod 's hooked up to the ship 's power but there 's no data link . That would explain why this chamber never showed up on any of our system scans . But what is she doing in here ? You think she 's got her memories ? Let 's thaw her , find out . [ FOUR ] We sure we wanna do that ? She 's obviously in here for a reason . [ SIX ] Any dreams or visions that would explain it ? No . Let 's thaw her and find out . I said that like five seconds ago . [ ONE ] Yeah , but coming from her , it actually sounds reasonable . You 're welcome . How come she 's not waking up ? [ THE ANDROID ] She 's been in stasis for a long time . I have her sedated until I can fully evaluate her physical condition . And ? She has Tataryn 's disease . It 's a disorder common on planets where they mine Serillium , a result of the run-off from refineries leaching into the water supply . In its advanced state , it causes rapid decline in specific neurological motor function related to autonomic life-support . There 's no known cure . Whoa , wait , so she 's dying ? [ THE ANDROID ] Without question . It 's probably why she was in the pod in the first place . To halt the progress of the disease . If we keep her out , how long does she have ? [ THE ANDROID ] It 's impossible to say . It could be a matter of days . We 've gotta put her back in there . You 're the one that wanted to take her out in the first place . This is different , we should put her back in . Hey , we need to find out what she knows . [ lock clinks ] Check it out . Maybe , it 's the Android 's sister ? [ TWO ] A service bot ? [ ONE ] Entertainment model . Disassembled , but in good condition . Well proportioned . Whoa ! I 'll say . She got a wide range of capabilities . Magic tricks . Twirling . Con ... tortion . [ THE ANDROID ] I 'm preparing to awaken the woman we found in stasis . Okay . On my way - Go ahead . Bring the bot online . I 'm sure she 's got a great personality to go with that body . It 's amazing how the skin fuses so you can 't even see the seams . [ FIVE ] It says her programming is standard issue for an entertainment model . I don 't think she 's gonna be much help with repairs or anything like that . Well , she can learn , can 't she ? And anyway , there 's lots she can do in the meantime . Just turn her on . I mean , activate her . Hello . My name is Wendy . Would you like to run a full demonstration of my capabilities ? No , that 's- - All right , we , umm ... We read the manual , Wendy . Why does she talk like that ? [ ONE ] Umm , the ... factory default is set to something called " Aussie . " Cool . What can I do for you ? [ WENDY ] I can sing you a song . I 'm programmed in multiple popular musical styles . Dubstep , Tropical House , Classical . N-No thanks . That 's , umm , that 's fine . [ WENDY ] Perhaps you 'd like to take advantage of my advanced culinary programming . We don 't have much to work with . Our rations are kinda low . Not to worry . I 'll extend the rations by double and make them taste better than you could ever imagine . Show me the kitchen . [ THE ANDROID ] You were in stasis . Now you 're safe on board our ship . Who are you ? You can call me Two . I was about to ask you the same thing . My name is Sarah . Do you remember how you got here ? Marcus ! [ SARAH ] Thank god you 're here . Uhh , look , I don 't know how to tell you this , but , umm ... What 's wrong ? We had an accident with our stasis pods . In a way , you 're lucky that you weren 't stored with us because ... we all lost our memories . None of us can remember anything from before a couple of weeks ago . Are you serious ? You really don 't remember me ? L 'm sorry , believe me , I wish I did , but I- - Then why did you revive me ? We thought that maybe you would have some answers for us . I ... don 't know you , or you ... I 've never seen this ship before . The last thing I remember was Marcus putting me in stasis on my homeworld ... telling me everything would be all right . This looks amazing . [ SIX ] I can get used to this . Mmm . I 've utilized less than two percent of current rations for the creation of this meal . [ FIVE ] Mmm , oh wow ! This is even better than I expected . Yeah . [ WENDY ] I 'm glad . [ ONE ] Mmm ! You 'll be happy to know that I 've improved the efficiency of the coolant systems by eleven percent . [ SIX ] Mmm ! Way to go . Wendy increased the taste of our food by a hundred percent . - - [ WENDY giggles ] - - [ THE ANDROID ] I see . You should also know that if I hadn 't effected the repairs , the system would have shut down completely in a matter of days , crippling the ship . Good catch . Wow . Mmm , wow ! Shall I prepare the next course ? There 's a next course ? Hell yeah ! [ laughs ] M [ SIX ] mm ! Oh my god ! [ SIX chuckles ] [ FIVE giggles ] How much do you know about " Marcus " ? L-I know what he- - What he was , what he is . It didn 't- - It doesn 't matter . [ SARAH ] On my world , anyone who stood up to the Corporations was an outlaw . How did you meet ? [ SARAH ] It was the end of a terrible winter . [ SARAH ] I was out early one morning gathering firewood . [ SARAH ] I found him lying in the forest near my farm . [ SARAH ] At first , I thought he was dead . [ SARAH ] I managed to get him back to my house and dress his wounds . Later , he told me he was a mercenary for hire . That he 'd been wounded on a mission , and the others he was with had left him behind . Did he say who they were ? No . And were you alone when you found him ? Yeah , I had been living on my own for over a year after my husband died in the uprising . He was a miner . The uprising ... ? [ SARAH ] We knew people were getting sick , but the Ferrous doctors told us everything was fine . Then people started dying . That 's when the rebellion started . But ... we didn 't stand a chance . D-Did Three ever , umm ... Marcus . Did Marcus ever tell you what he was doing on your planet ? He 'd said that he was hired by a rival corporation to hijack a shipment of Serillium . The mission did not go as planned . Several of his crew were killed . And when he didn 't make it back to the rendezvous point they probably assumed he was dead . So , you saved his life . And he saved mine . At least for a while . [ grunts ] [ ONE ] Hey , you missed quite the meal . I don 't eat for pleasure . Right , anyway - I wanted to introduce you to Wendy . I 'm pleased to meet you . If there 's ever anything I can do for you , please don 't hesitate to ask . I don 't require entertainment . Well , you do require a massage . Why do you say that ? Your left shoulder sits two millimeters below your right , possibly indicating tension in your right supraspinatus or lats . It could affect your overall precision and technique . Well , it feels fine to me . [ laughs ] Turn around . [ ONE ] She 's not gonna hurt you . Is that better ? Umm ... Feels the same , no difference . Shall I stop ? No . Easy , tiger . [ THREE groans ] - - [ TWO ] There you are . - - [ THREE ] Don 't start . Did you finish that " thing " you needed to do ? [ THREE ] Don 't start ! [ TWO ] Hey , you have to talk to her . What am I supposed to say , huh ? [ TWO ] I don 't know , but it 's obvious there 's something between the two of you . Or at least there was . Yeah , but I don 't remember . So what 's the point ? [ TWO ] Look , against all imaginable odds it turns out that somebody in this galaxy doesn 't think you 're a total jerk . She 's alone in that room and scared out of her mind . And apparently , you 're the one who brought her on this ship . What are you gonna do about it ? Hi there . Hi . [ THREE ] Uhh , listen , I 'm sorry about before . Guess this whole thing 's just got me a little weirded out , that 's all ... Yeah , m-me too . Y-You , um , do you wanna go for a walk or something ? Yeah . [ THREE ] Yeah , okay . I 'd like that . [ THREE ] Okay . All right . [ SARAH grunts ] [ ONE gasps ] God ! I-I didn 't realize you were there . What would you like to do now ? Uh ... [ WENDY ] I 'm programmed with various recreational subroutines . Do you like fun ? Uhh , I-l guess ? [ WENDY ] What kind of fun would you like to have ? We could dance ? Play a game ? Umm , no thank you . Um , I was actually about to lie down . Excellent . Would you like me to join ? I 'm adept at a wide variety of contemporary erotic techniques : Quasaring , the infinite moebius , dunking the cosmic donut- - That 's- - I really shouldn 't . Umm , wait . What was that last one ? O-On the other hand , if you prefer male anatomy I come with interchangeable parts . No , no-no-no . I ... appreciate the offer . But I , umm , it 's just a little weird . What 's weird about it ? Sexuality is a natural human function . S-Sure , but ... you 're an android . I mean , what would you get out of it ? I possess almost 3,000 touch receptors . I can experience pleasure . [ WENDY ] I sense anxiety . If you like , I can turn off my performance analytics before we begin ? Look , I appreciate the offer , I just don 't think I 'd feel ... right ... " .01 " ... On the other hand , there 's only one way to find out . Really ? [ ONE ] She 's ... not complicated . [ electronic buzzing ] [ THE ANDROID in British accent ] 'Ello ! you look to be in a right smashing good mood . You 'll be chuffed to ' ear I 've found a way ter convert the engine 's residual byproducts into a nutritious , protein-rich meal supplement . Why are you talking like that ? [ Irish accent ] Oh , ye 've noticed . It just so ' appens that I , too , come programmed wif several unique linguistic varieties . [ German accent ] Zhere ofer two tozen eccents to choose vrom . You can zelect vone or ve can go vith a daily rotation . L - | , umm , I - | don 't- - [ THE ANDROID in Jamacian accent ] Don 't worry about it , mon . Yuh dun havtah decide rite dis second . Dere 's ova twooooo dozen . No . Just no . [ Australian accent ] Maybe , we can twalk about it a bit layta then ? Home sweet home . I 'm sorry about that , let rne just move these . It 's okay , you don 't have to apologize . [ SARAH ] I know the kind of world you live in . Yeah , but there 's no where to sit so ... But you have to believe me . There was a time when we were together that you were different . [ SARAH ] Dinner 's ready . [ SARAH ] Are you going somewhere ? This was a mistake . I don 't think so . [ MARCUS ] No . [ MARCUS ] Yeah , Sarah , you don 't know who I am . I 'm not the guy who stays , I 'm the guy who leaves . You don 't have to be . Sarah ? [ SARAH ] That was the first sign that there was ... something wrong with me . Sarah ! Look at me . What 's wrong ? [ SARAH ] After that , I was nothing but a burden . You could 've left at any time . But ... you didn 't . [ SARAH ] You stayed . Maybe I felt guilty . Well , that might 've kept you for maybe a day or two . But ... not for months . [ SARAH ] Not for a whole winter . Feeding me . Taking care of me . L-I gotta be honest with you , that doesn 't sound anything like me . [ SARAH ] Look , you may not know it , but I do . You ... are a good man . [ SARAH coughs ] Whatcha doing ? I 'm going through the medical database , looking for any new information on Tataryn 's disease . Find anything useful ? Not yet . [ THE ANDROID ] You 're doing something new with your hair . Yeah , Wendy did it for me . Do you like it ? I don 't believe there was anything wrong with the way it was before . You don 't like her much , do you ? I don 't have an opinion either way . I just think there are more relevant functions she could be performing besides cooking and playing games . Stress can cause humans to act inefficient . Relieving stress can be a lot like recharging batteries . Laughter is the best medicine . Something like that . I 'm not programmed for humor ... [ FIVE ] Well , just because people are having a little fun with Wendy doesn 't mean we don 't appreciate what you do . I mean , I don 't think we could get by without you . [ THE ANDROID ] According to my self-diagnostics , my performance is satisfactory in every way that my programming dictates . Now , don 't go getting a big head or anything . My head is always a consistent size . See , who says you 're not funny ? Look , Wendy is new here and she 's just trying to fit in . I know what that feels like . And I think if you gave her a chance , you 'd really like her . [ keys clicking ] [ TWO ] What 're you doing ? I have tidied the room and am now attempting to learn the ship 's system . So I can be more helpful . Is there anything I can do for you ? No , I 'm good . I could tell you what most pleases One sexually . What makes you think I would wanna know that ? Your body temperature rises .25 degrees whenever you 're around him . Also , blood flow to your cheeks increases , indicating- - O-Okay , that 's enough . Where is One anyways ? [ WENDY ] I think he 's in the mess hall . I made him something special . [ FIVE ] What happened ? I don 't know , she just collapsed . She 's breathing but I can 't wake her , can you help her ? No , I don 't know what to do . Where 's the Android ? S-She went to the bridge to run a diagnostic . Okay ... Android , we need you in the infirmary . I 'm on my way . - -Hello . - -Hello . I 'd like to inform you that your presence no longer offends me . As a new member of this ship 's extended crew , it must be difficult to fit in , especially in that outfit . And I 've been less than welcoming . I regret my actions that I can only attribute to a flaw in my programming . I misjudged you and I 'm sorry . Apology not accepted . [ FOUR ] Mmm . [ SIX ] Mmm . [ chuckles ] How 's lunch ? Fantastic . Even he 's on board . Her soup is , umm , very good . That 's weird . [ beeps ] [ TWO ] We 're locked in . We just dropped out of FTL . [ TWO ] Android , this is Two , we got a problem . One , Four , Six , and I are locked in the mess . Android , do you read ? [ VOICE ] Crew of the Raza , this is Cyrus King . I 'm sure you 're surprised to be hearing my voice . You probably thought I was dead . Maybe if we remembered who you were . [ CYRUS ] I arranged for you to acquire this service android knowing that when you activated it , I would finally get my revenge . [ CYRUS ] You killed everyone in my unit . Burned them all alive . Probably deserved it . [ CYRUS ] Now you 're going to suffer the same fate . Your ship has been directed to fly into the nearest star . [ CYRUS ] Here 's hoping your last moments will be as tortured and painful as possible . Come with me . Three , do you read me ? [ THREE ] Yeah , go ahead . [ TWO ] Our Android 's offline and we 're trapped in the mess . Is Five with you ? [ THREE ] Yeah . [ TWO ] Good , tell her to stay put . I need you to get to the port side sub-level power relay . You can shut down the engines from there . It 'll buy us some time , slow our progress toward the star , so we can figure a way out of this . B-But you don 't know how- - Shh . [ TWO ] Do you understand me ? [ THREE ] Yeah , I understand . Three out . [ whispers ] Kill your comm . L-I don 't get it . She knows you don 't know how to do that . Yeah , but Wendy doesn 't know . She 's monitoring comms . So you 're the bait . Exactly . Once Wendy leaves the bridge , I need you to get in there , find a way to work around whatever it is she 's done . I 'll distract her . That 's gonna take some time . I 'll give you what I can , kid . Go . [ THREE ] Hey . What 's going on ... ? Having a little technical problem with the ship . It 's gonna be okay , we 're gonna fix it . But your condition 's gotten worse so we 're gonna put you back in stasis . No , no , no , no , not yet- - [ THREE whispers ] Yeah . Shhh ... I promise I will not rest until I 've done everything I can to save you . 'Kay ... [ THREE ] Okay , I guess a little rest every now and then isn 't such a bad thing . No . I wish that I remembered . It 's okay . We 'll make new memories . [ SARAH ] I 'll see you soon , okay ? Yeah . Promise ? [ THREE ] I promise . I Kay . [ THREE ] Whoa ! [ THREE ] This is Three ! Do your thing ! Do you have her engaged ? Well , I guess you could say that . [ THREE grunts ] [ TWO ] Good , can you keep her busy ? I can try . Damn it ! Five , where are you ? I-I 'm on the bridge , but I-I can 't access the nav system , she 's locked me out . I 'm trying to find a work-around . Yeah , we 'll get to that in a minute . For now , see if you can access nonessential systems . Switch all doors to manual . I 'm on it . [ THREE grunts ] I 've got it ! Good girl . [ ONE , FOUR , SIX grunt ] [ TWO ] You 're with me . [ THREE grunts ] [ THREE grunts ] [ THREE yelpS ] [ groans ] [ THREE grunts ] [ THREE grunts ] [ THREE ] Wait ! This runs counter to your programming ! Fun , remember ? ! Fun ? I don 't remember fun . No ? [ WENDY ] I just remember cooking and cleaning and dunking the cosmic doughnut . Waugh ! Wait , w-what was that last one ? Doughnut . [ THREE yells ] I thought you were designed to serve , not kill ... I find your view on female androids both antiquated and offensive . You okay ? Never better , why do you ask ? [ SIX ] Two , this is Six . We 've taken care of the robot . Yeah , well , I wish that was the worst of our problems . We 're locked out of navigation , and we 're still headed straight for the star . There 's no way to change course . [ TWO ] She put an encrypted passcode on the ship 's main control systems . It could take hours to solve it . [ ONE ] Whoa ! We don 't have that kind of time ! [ TWO ] This is Two . Is Wendy 's head damaged ? It 's detached , but it looks okay . Good , bring it to the bridge and be quick . In the meantime , space her body . [ electrics sparking ] The power is dying all over the ship . How are we gonna find the code in all that ? There 's a log that 's recorded on a timeline . She has to have set the passcode sometime within the last hour . Won 't work on manual . We 'll have to reset . All right . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . [ SIX ] O-Oh , we got a problem here . Wendy 's body just came alive . We powered the head . It must 've activated the body remotely . Ah , it 's no big deal . Robot can 't see without her head . [ THREE grunts ] [ SIX ] Scratch that , she can see us just fine ! [ THREE grunts ] How is that possible ? It 's the link ! She 's tied into the ship 's internal sensors . We gotta pull the plug ! [ TWO ] Not yet ! I don 't have the code . [ SIX grunts ] Any time now ... would be good ! [ TWO ] Got it ! We 've got nav control ! [ ONE grunts ] Come on . You all right ? [ SIX chuckles ] I hate robots . [ FIVE ] How long do you think it 'll take for her to fully regenerate ? Depends on how extensive the damage is . We 'll have to wait and see . No , no ... What happened ? [ THREE ] The pod must 've been damaged by the power fluctuations . Without stasis , the disease ran its course . It 's my fault . I-lt was my idea to activate the robot . It was stupid . Did you program that thing to attack us ? No . Did you give Sarah an incurable disease ? No . Then what are we talking about ? [ knocking ] Yeah ? [ TWO ] Hey , is this a bad time for a status update ? Can 't it wait ? It 's gonna take us some time to sort through all the items we found in the mystery room . Some are locked and inaccessible for now , but , uhh , we 've got enough funds to effect full repairs , restock , and even have enough leftover for a few luxury items . Great . Maybe another robot , one of those entertainment models . A less buggy version . No , thanks . Latent killer subprogram aside , she was a damn good cook . And I imagine she had other worthy skills . Look , I don 't know what I was thinking . I have a pretty good idea . [ ONE ] Well , as it turns out , I was wrong . It was complicated . I 've been thinking . Maybe , complicated isn 't such a bad thing .

 God , dammit . How 's the plane supposed to land when it 's pitch black out here ? We 're screwed , man . Shut up ! The boss said they 'd come for us . We have something they want . Huh , tell him to kiss my ass . All he cares about is that bitch ! Now what ? We have to go up there and turn on the lights ? Get ourselves killed ? Stop ! There 's something there . And we 're coming to you live from Rio de Janeiro , it 's the official launch of ocean airlines brand new luxurious jumbo jet , it 's the a390 , and a string of cars are coming in right now . We got VIP celebrities , and the CEO of ocean airlines , himself . Mr. Gary Gao . First of all , let 's have a look at who 's in car number one . Hello there . It 's so nice of you . You are looking fabulous . Now , can you tell me , are you considering a merger with ocean airlines , after the launch today . Are you a pilot of ocean airlines ... I 'm the co-captain . And , may I ask , who are you wearing ... How many on this maiden flight ? Eight VIP 's , as requested , sir . Each carefully selected . Beyond the corporate staff , of course . This investment , I 'm talking about the time to modify the aircraft , from an a380 , to an a390 , plus setting up a transpacific debut , as well as a live broadcast worldwide , that 's cost me over a 100 million us dollars . Any mistake ... And this could be another Titanic . I want you to make sure that you take care of the prince . It 's under control , sir . I know he 's our golden goose . In fact , I 've even invited a popular singer he 's quite fond of . Is that the surprise you were talking about , the superstar ? Is he here ? Not yet , but his agent did confirm with me again this morning , so ... Let 's hope it 's not PSY . Distinguished guests , welcome aboard our maiden voyage . Our exclusive , priority only , a390 , will be taking off shortly . So , please be seated and fasten your safety belts . Good job . It 's great . It 's kind of weird , you know , making this announcement to so few people . Uh , I bet they 're a hundred times harder to deal with though . Stop it . Hey , Ruoxin . Ruoxin . Uh , why don 't you stay here with me and help out with the guests , okay ? I 'm not a flight attendant . But you are the prettiest woman we have in our entire company . Exactly . I 'm a pilot . Ruoxin , it 's okay . Xiang . Please , come on . Come on ! Where in the world are you ? Most memorable flight of your lifetime . I 'm ready . Excuse me . The headline queen . It is truly a great honor for you to be traveling with us . I have been one of your most loyal fans . But , I guess you 're kind of forced to follow me . Seeing as I just interviewed your second wife . Glenda , huh ? She certainly has been one of your biggest fans . Let me give you the inside scoop . The reason for our divorce . She couldn 't cook ! You know , the best way to a man 's heart , is through his stomach . Rest assured , Mr. Gao , I 'm sure you won 't regret it . This is captain Anderson , on behalf of myself and the crew , we welcome you all aboard this evening on the new a390 . We 'll be leaving the tarmac in a few minutes so please relax in your seats ... As we get underway . From all of us at ocean airlines , we thank you for being part of this momentous flight . This plane is incredible ! I mean suites , an upstairs restaurant , and a table lounge , and bar . It 's like a flying castle . Hey , they say it can fly into space . No , no , no , sweetheart . Just all alcohol for me . Hey ! Mr. Rodman ! It 's really you ! I love watching you box . I love watching your acting . Yo , my man . So what you here for ? Me ? Yeah , you . You look like one of those rich guys , not just somebody in showbiz . You must be , Rodman ? I 'm , Khadsa . Associate chief of the Yan Shang group . Big fan of yours . All right . Much respect . That 's ancient history , right there . But , you know what , uh , it 's time for me to do my own inspection . Hey , gorgeous . Why don 't you bring me something a little stronger to inspect ? Right away . I 'm just going to put this in a four cabin for a moment , and I 'll bring it right back after take-off . Will there be enough room ? Oh , yes . The storage compartment in this plane is big enough to fit a grand piano . I should have brought one . You 're so sweet . I saw you play once ... For the New York philharmonic , Mr. Kim . Oh , really ? Yes . It was a summer trip , 15 years ago . But , I 'll honestly never forget that night . It will be an honor to play for you again , later . Uh ! The kitchen is upstairs , master chef . I 'm so sorry . I was looking for a chili sauce for my Shifu 's recipe . Kelly , said it might be down here . I hope your secret sauce is enough to meet expectations , tonight . Okay . And , it 's time to take off . Okay , lets see ... This , and this ... Hey , am I late ? Ladies and gentlemen , our surprise mystery guest , has arrived . 2020 's voice of the world ! Colin ! Khadsa , my man . How 's it going , superstar ? Good . How are you doing ? I can never get used to you wearing all this golden flashy stuff . Tell me , how 's living the big dream ? Can 't complain . You know , I got everybody to vote for you on the voice , right ? I knew it . I knew it was you ! Can I take your bag ? Thank you . So , everyone , I just want to say thank you , on behalf of ocean airlines on behalf of ocean airlines , I 'd like to welcome all of you aboard . We plan to have a very enjoyable flight . Cheers ! Cheers ! Peter . Uh , excuse me . Yeah . Surprise , huh ? Yeah . I found out that they were roommates at Yale . Best buddies . You a smart ass ? He 's popular . Very popular . Mia , only agreed to shoot this because of ... Because of him . Even that bitch knew Colin was coming ... And I didn 't ? He screws this day up , I don 't want to ever see you again . Should be kissing my ass . Flight check , check . Okay , with the radar , check . Confirm co-ordinates . Check . Jason . Never ask me to do that . Ever again . It just goes to show how much the company values you . So , how are we looking out there ? Any chance of a live performance by the big superstar ? Hm , forget about the show , Mr. Gao , clearly isn 't a fan . Looks like , Peter , kissed his ass , in the wrong place . Isn 't the rich prince the guy we 're trying to impress ? It should be exactly what the boss wanted . Inviting the guy 's old class mate . Hey , how do you feel about this a390 ? The company says that it uses magnetic convection . Enough power to fly beyond the atmosphere . You can take over once we 're in the autopilot mode . You just hand it back before landing . Screw you ! Jason only chose you for this debut because he thought you need more training . Oh . Hm-mm . Don 't get me involved with this , guys . Ruoxin , you 're needed . You cannot go in there . We are about to take off right now . Okay , pre-flight check . Ruoxin , you 're needed downstairs after take off . Oh , and , make sure you tell the media that you were once a flight attendant with us . Tell them that ... We give everyone at ocean airlines an opportunity to grow . I am not a flight attendant any more . Serving guests isn 't really my responsibility now . Monica and I , will be enough . Yeah , you see , this isn 't any normal flight . Even Mr. Gao , is out there serving . So you will do , whatever it is , we need you to do . Besides ... You 're not the one flying today . All right , ladies , ready to serve . It 's my newest dish , Kung Pao chicken . That isn 't new at all . Well ... A thousand different chefs , will cook a thousand different Kung Pao chicken 's . We haven 't met . I 'm , chef Mike . I 'm from Sichuan . There 's only one Kung Pao chicken in my menu . Why isn 't chef Liu , here ? Uh , he had high blood pressure . The doctor didn 't allow him on board . What 'd you think ? How does it taste ? You 're telling me a Chinese Sichuan chef sent an American , to cook Sichuan food ? Well , I am his protege . My Shifu just wants to share Sichuan cooking with the world . Did you know that , Marco Polo , learned about spaghetti from the Chinese people ? Uh , why are you here ? You should be out there with our guests . You should be on the first floor . You didn 't know that this chef was American , did you ? Oh , thank you . Here you are , sir . Blackjack ! Thank you , Mr. Rodman , I haven 't been so lucky since my last Hong Kong film award . You should drink more , my dear best actress . Luck comes with good liquor . Cheers ! You know , lost in the pacific is my go-to song for karaoke , every time . Your voice tells so many stories . Thank you . You know what , I 'm sure we have a lot of time on this flight , so I can tell you more stories . Really ? Thank you . Your highness , when we arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow night , there 'll be plenty of press waiting for us . And by next week , the stock in ocean airlines will sky rocket . If that 's true , it 's a win-win . So , you 're on board with our mergers in acquisition ? So far , I think it 's looking good . That 's wonderful . Very good . All right here ... The a390 is the largest plane in the sky ... Oh , I 'm sorry . Excuse me , excuse me , I 'm , Mia Ren , with global news network . Can I ask you a few questions ? I 'd be fine with that , but I need to go to the cockpit now . She 's actually our co-captain , so it 's not really a great time . I can arrange a meeting or an interview for you later , if you 'd like ? Oh ! Does ocean airlines plan to replace all of it 's captains , with such beauties ? Like luxury airplanes where they target the wealthy ? Drink , please . Hey , bro . What 's going on ? It 's been a long time . What 'd you say , we rack ' em up ? What are we playing for ? How about this plane ? 'Cause it 's going to be yours , sooner or later . Please excuse me . You two have fun . Sir . We have a stage two , code black , emergency . What is it ? Can you tell me why the Sichuan food is being cooked by an American ? Yeah , that is a concern , Peter . Well , you really messed up today . You know that ? Haven 't seen him since he was 18 . You have any idea what you have done ? Re-uniting me with this ... Juvenile , at a critical time . Wait , he 's your son ? Wants to make a fool out of me . Your son is a superstar . Yeah , I know . I wanted an heir , not an entertainer . How come the storm sprung up like that ? Weather forecast didn 't say anything about it . I 've never seen anything so massive . What did the control tower say ? This is one of the least stable areas in the pacific . Control knows nothing about the weather here . What happened ? Hey , Gary . We have some pretty severe weather build up in the area . We 're gonna need a new route . Jason , this is the most sophisticated commercial aircraft to date . You know , I don 't care how you fly it , but , you must land my plane in Hong Kong , on time . With weather like this , we definitely can 't land on time . For the safety of the passengers , the crew , and the plane , Gary , with the severity of this weather ... We need to bypass this , and it 's going to take at least two hours . Two hours late , for Hong-Kong ? Well , can you make up that time ? Can you fly faster ? If this were a standard airbus , yes , it wouldn 't be a problem , but , we are in a converted a390 . It 's pretty much a spaceship , and gulps up fuel , now , we have enough for the original route from Rio to Hong-Kong . The fact that we need to bypass ... We need to land , and refuel no , we 're not stopping . Why don 't we keep going . It will take at-least three hours to get to the nearest alternative airport in the west pacific . Never mind refueling time . Which would have a five hour delay for Hong Kong , minimum . There 's no way in hell I 'm gonna allow that . The media 's not gonna wait five hours . The debut , the hundred million dollars that I spent , the whole thing will be a big joke . But , Mr. Gao , we have to . Thunder storms in the pacific ocean are no joke . We 've got no choice . Think about the lightning , just now . Ruoxin , please . Look , you guys are the best pilots that I have , that 's why you 're here . This aircraft can fly at the highest altitude , I don 't care ! Just fly above the storm . Gary , even if we do that , we still need to refuel . Just fly through the damn storm ! Will you ? Okay make an announcement to the passengers tell them that the safety of this aircraft is completely reliable . Xiang , check the wing conditions . Just keep them down . Ruoxin , make a personal announcement to the passengers . This is gonna get bumpy . Head east . May I have your attention please ? This is the co-captain , Ruoxin , our flight will be experiencing turbulence . Please return to your seats , and fasten your safety belts . Thank you . Wow . Huh ... Okay . Oh ! Sorry , Mr. boxer . I feel a little bit dizzy and scared . No . Shh , sh , sh , sh ... Don 't worry about that . Look , I already have a nice suite here . Why don 't we go and explore it ? Why are you still here ? I 'm just finishing my second course of khow suey chicken , you wanna try ? Get this mess cleaned up . Find yourself a seat , and buckle in . Are we landing already ? I 'm going to gather reviews ... How are we doing ? It could be worse , somewhat . Height ? Just passed 45 , still climbing . Increase to 48 . Oh ! We 're in trouble . Descend . Xiang , check on your perimeters . Ruoxin , check both wings , get Gary in here , asap . Affirmative . Mr. Gao . Mr. Gao . Mm-mm ? Something about an emergency , please come with me . Quickly . Bob . Bob . What is happening ? Flood her again ! We have to shut the port engine down and land the plane . Lightning strike on port engine ! Firm alarm has been activated ! The engine is on fire ? I checked , haven 't seen anything , no flames . But the alarm 's still on . Auto fire detection system 's cycled twice and the light 's still on . It might have short circuited the fire engine system and this is a false alarm , but we 're at risk of combustion . We have to prep for landing and have a look at this plane . She 's right . Where 's the nearest airport ? Sorman islands , two hours outside the storm zone . Which enables us to bypass . That 's too far . There 's got to be a landing field , or something closer . Mr. Gao , we can 't keep risking it ! All right , the lay over inspection , is approved . But we have to hurry . We can 't be late for the live broadcast . The only other option we have is in an abandoned airport at ... Fortune island , it reads at 30 nautical miles . We 're gonna land there , we 're gonna inspect the plane , and then we 're moving on . It 's very dangerous to land at an abandoned airport at midnight . There 's low visibility . There are rumors about that island . Some kind of supernatural monster . Nobody lives there now , even the military pulled out . Elite pilots , please don 't tell me you 're afraid of the darkness and some crazy fairy tale . It 's not a fairytale . Eight years ago , one of our flights was attacked while trying to depart from this island . Yeah , but there 's no concrete evidence from that investigation . No one knows what the real cause of the damage was . Come on , Jason , put this thing on the ground , will you . It 's a go I guess for fortune island . Ruoxin , prepare passengers and cabin crew for landing . Sir , is everything okay ? Tell everyone we gotta land . Landing ? Yeah . For what ? Just shut up and listen ! Just say , we have a little surprise . That 's all you got to say , okay . Everyone ... We planned a special experience for all of you . A short stop at pacific island . We hope fortune island will bring you luck . A pristine tropical island . So romantic . And what if we don 't want to go ? Thanks for checking in control . Everything is all right , we 're just re-routing an inter bypass for thunderstorms in the area . So , it 'll be about a one hour delay before we change next signal point . Possible radar loss , due to weather . Affirm . Good job , captain . This is reckless . We 're violating countless aviation regulations . Xiang ... Xiang , shut down the transponder . This is way more exciting than I pictured . It feels like we 're on Mars . I 'm gonna go check the engines . Xiang , you stay here . I 'll go with you . Me too . Xiang , stay . Just in case . Ruoxin , prepare emergency hatch . All right . So exciting . Are we getting off ? I 'm so sorry , but , uh , on this island there are ... A lot of nocturnal animals , and it 's not safe to get out . However , you can take as many photographs as you 'd like , from right here inside the plane . No signal ! What 's the point of being anywhere if you can 't even post selfies in front of it . So boring . Yay , this is so cool . What a beautiful island . So , what 's your lie of the day ? Why are we really here ? Don 't mess this up . I 'm still your father . Father ? Did you just call yourself my father ? Really ? You left when I was a kid . You sent me off to boarding schools . You never cared ! You didn 't even come see me . And you know what ? You pretty much killed mom . Ladies and gentlemen , we are pleased to introduce you to , chef Mike . Who 's actually the last apprentice , under the master of Sichuan cuisine , chef Liu . He 's also a very special guest of ours today , so , we invite you to go on upstairs , and enjoy some of his very special , Sichuan cuisine . Peter ... Listen , I 'm going outside for pictures . Come grab me when we take off , okay . No , no , no . I 'm sorry , no one 's going outside the plane . No . Come on , I 'm a VIP . Can I help you , miss Ren ? Problem solved , Mr. Gao . What problem ? Don 't play dumb . I know we forced the landing on this island . What do you want ? Footage , outside the plane . This is fortune island after all . And if I refuse , you 're gonna slander us in the press , is that it ? You got it . Come on . Go with them . No one leaves the tarmac . Stay close , we 're taking off soon . There are monsters on the island . You sure you don 't wanna come ? I 'd rather stay here . Xiang , can you run some diagnostics on the engine please , I 'm seeing some scorch marks here , but ... No internal damage . All right , what does it say ? Oh , it 's here . All right , it looks like both engines are fully functional . We got to go . Something 's wrong with this place . Hey , can we leave ? Yes , we will take off soon . Xiang , can you prepare the cockpit for departure ? You gotta be kidding me . Arrgh ! Who let them out ? I can guess who . Just help me get them back , hurry up ! Come back . We are leaving . It 's an honor for me to be here tonight . I 've been passionate about Chinese food for a very long time . And , I was lucky enough to become , chef Liu 's apprentice , last year . Please , enjoy . As a lady from Hong Kong , I 'd say it 's great . I 'm not from Sichuan , but speaking as an Arabian , I love it ! Our new generation of Sichuan chefs . Ocean airlines is offering Sichuan cuisine on all international flights out of Hong Kong , next month . What 's going on ? Something wrong with the plane ? I don 't know , but , I think Mia Ren found something interesting to shoot . Ahem . It 's said fortune island had been taken over by military , but , there are no signs of such a presence now . Bob . Kelly , get me to the ground . Mr. Gao , get the plane ready for take off . You see that ! This is what you call your VIP experience ! Monica , get everyone downstairs and ready for take off ! What 's going on ? Excuse me , please . Xiang , take off right now ! Jason , Peter ! Close the hatch , now ! Get us started , hurry ! Take off , Jason . Jason ! Jason , hurry up ! Jason ... Jason ... Captain ! Captain , we 're taking off ! Let 's go . Close the hatch , right now ! We still got people down there , asshole ! Stay down , Peter . Come on , come on . I got you . We 're running out of bullets , let us on ! Let them on . They saved us . You just watch them . Trust me , it will be fine . Okay . So , the rumors are true . I told them to stay inside . Forget it . What 's going on ? Yeah , what 's you guys story ? Well , first of all we 're all kind of embarrassed , about how we must look . We 've been held up in a warehouse for the last two weeks . No rescue , no one showed up . But it 's surprising to see a commercial aircraft land there . My name is lieutenant , Vincent Riggs , and this is , sergeant Nikki Lee . We are members of a joint task force assembled by the u.N , sent to fortune island on a blockade mission . And we thought it would be an easy in and out , until we ran into those creatures . They 're just too many of them . And when we arrived , the island was already out of control . So , for two weeks we fought hard , until we were the only survivors . And we had given up hope ... And you guys came along . I 'm sorry to hear about your men . But , thank you so much for saving us . Of course . It 's been a ... Such a thrilling trip , Mr. Gao . Now who 's in charge of your show ? I am . Gary Gao . President , and CEO , of ocean airlines . Thanks for having us aboard , Mr. Gao . My pleasure , I 'm glad I could be of help . Ladies and gentlemen , I 'd like to extend my most Sincere apologies for the recent accidents . We 've contacted authorities in Hong Kong , and , when we land they 'll be taking over . Accident ? Are you out of your mind ? Two of our men just died . In his eyes , stock market prices are way more important than human lives . You ungrateful little brat . Who 's been spending a small fortune on you , his entire life ? So , are you publicly admitting that I 'm your son ? Yeah . Wow ! Okay ... So , I 'm going to publicly admit that this is my self-centered father ! That 's my son . I see now ! You have totally got his nose . What ! So , you planned all this just so that I would invest ? No , prince , that was never my plan . I haven 't seen my son in five years . Not since I divorced his mother . And you know what , you never showed up to her funeral . Kelly , uh ... Bring everyone upstairs , make sure they 're comfortable . Ladies and gentlemen , our next destination is Hong Kong . I could use a cup of tea . Please try to enjoy the rest of your flight . I 'm fed up with this special experience . I 'm going to get some sleep before landing in Hong Kong . Just like Rodman , the clever man . Chef . Shouldn 't you have gone upstairs ? I mean you don 't wanna ... Stick around for the rest of this family drama , do you ? Are you my boss now ? Didn 't think so . I 'm sorry . Yeah . Going down for pictures , and now two people are dead . You couldn 't call headquarters for back up ? Our COMS were down . What were you using for relay ? Satellite equipment . It was damaged during the fight . The creatures destroyed everything in the airport . All we could do was wait for rescue . But you 're not really trusting us , are you , chef ? That 's okay , he used to be military . Ex-soldier ? No wonder . So you 're not a cook ? Uh , I 'm actually just a cook now . Um , I retired a long time ago . It 's just that I can 't trust someone who keeps their ... Finger on the trigger . It 's all right . You have every reason not to trust us . But this documentation will prove that we belong to the united nations , biological crisis team . The communication equipment was damaged during the last take off . What ? It seems we have no choice but to trust each other . That been said , we need to reach these coordinates as soon as possible . About 500 nautical miles from here . Oh , it 's our , headquarters . A transit airport under the ocean offering supplies , repairs ... anything you would need . That 's not necessary , we can make it to Hong Kong . I 'm afraid not , Mr. Gao , not in this storm . Well , this flight cannot afford any further delays . It 's not up to you , I 'm afraid . The coordinates are right in the middle of a dangerous area . A Bermuda triangle of sorts . Ships get lost there all the time . It 's on the regular route . I guess I need to make myself clear . Our incident has forced this flight into a state of emergency . For everyone 's safety , the u.N will take control of the flight . Is that understood ? A take over ? That 's not up to you . The u.N inspects and supplies civilian flights now , does it ? In all honesty , veteran ... It 's a secret base . Those creatures you saw were mutated cats . The intel on them is top secret . So , to avoid global panic ... The authorities set up base on fortune island as containment ... To prevent it from getting worse . So , we appreciate your cooperation in getting us to our headquarters as soon as possible . Oh , basically you 're saying that we need to get brainwashed because we saw the mutant cats ? Are the men in black , there waiting for us ? It doesn 't matter . I 'm against it . Look , it 's just some weird ass creature on a primitive island . But , it 's hardly a global disaster . They saved us . Those two . I trust them . And the only thing you should be worried about , is the safety of your own passengers . I am concerned about the passengers , and we should land at Hong Kong . They did save us . And we know how terrifying those monsters were . We should cooperate . Are you out of your mind , Ruoxin ! You still want to work with ocean airlines ! First and foremost , I am the captain . Jason 's gone . We violated aviation regulations anyway . We are running out of fuel . It 's too risky to fly through the storm . You have such a clear mind , captain . That 's it . I have final say as captain . Ruoxin , look , look , it 's not that simple . Whoever you are , I have made up my mind . Okay , the communication equipment was destroyed on purpose . Not during that fight . The antennas were on top of the plane , the creatures were on the ground . Listen ... You 're skilled , and you 're brave ... But how can you tell whether it was on purpose , or not ? Because I led a specialized counter terrorism unit . Knocking out comms was an everyday thing . How do you prove any of that ? All I see now is a cook , who makes terrible Sichuan food . Look , we are in big trouble ... I need you to keep everyone safe . No more mistakes . Do you understand ? I understand . Just ... let me help you . Not only is the communication equipment damaged ... We are running out of fuel . It 's suicide , if we keep our route to fly through the storm . The co-ordinates has given us a chance . We 've got to try . Okay . Air safety is my main concern . There 's no better place to land within two hours . We have no choice . No more casualties . I understand . Trust me . I respect your decision . We 'll have a safe landing . Why don 't you head upstairs and relax over there ? I 'll go with you . Me too . You spying on me ? Shouldn 't make an innocent man feel uncomfortable . Your highness , looks like you 're enjoying your tea . I do hope our little setback just now won 't influence your assessment of oceanic airlines ? Mr. Gao ... The unexpected circumstances have proved too much . To be honest , a reassessment is necessary . For you 're own safety , okay ? What do you want ? Only to chat . Just curious ... What are you looking at ? It 's none of your business . Can I ask you a question ? What 's a beauty like you doing playing with guns ? I 'm sorry , I forgot to introduce the both of you . Prince Khadsa . Associate chief , of the Yan Shang group . Not every man is born rich . Your highness has ... Unique taste . I gotta ask ... Why become a chef after retiring ? Creation is better than destruction . Don 't you think ? I 've haven 't thought about it . Mike , Mr. Gao would like to see you upstairs for the next meal . Okay . That 's right , time to go cook something good . Gorgeous ! Do you have anything to drink ? Anything . What would you like ? Jameson . I 'm sick and tired of cave exploration . I 'm sick and tired of fighting those monsters . And I 'm sick and tired of pretending to be some sort of u.N force . Listen , major , you 're gonna have to play ball a little longer . It 's only because of these people that we got off that island . They 're already suspicious . Once we reach these coordinates , they 're gonna find out . Calm down . Now , we got this sample ... Now all we gotta do is sell it to the buyer . If that chef gets in our way ... I will take care of it . You promised , no more killing . Yes , but I also promised large amounts of money . Enough money to take your little boy , and live happily ... This has nothing to do with my son ! This has everything to do with your son ! You are here because of him . Not because of me . So , you are listening . Good . This ... This right here , we have to sell this at any cost . This ... The weather getting any better ? No . But we are flying low . Keeping clear of the storm ceiling . We had to change direction to avoid the center of the storm . I invested to train you as a pilot , and you 're disobeying orders . Is that how Jason trained you ? Jason ? Jason told me to do what a captain should . But it 's a damn shame he couldn 't tell you himself . It 's your decision that got him killed . I am not gonna repeat his mistake . It seems you don 't want to pilot my planes in the future . That 's fine . What I want to do ... Is make sure we have a future , Mr. Gao . She 's dead ! Lily young , she 's dead . Who found her ? She died so horrible . So tragically . Vincent is already in there . Everyone just stay calm . I 'm going in . What are you doing ? I 'm the captain , I have the right to deal with any threat . I suggest we don 't irritate them right now . Captain , the situation is under control . We may have to co oh , oh ... This where the party at ... Who are you ? I love your beard , man ! Mr. Rodman ... I 'm afraid I have to ask you a question . There are reports saying you have difficulties controlling your emotions , when you 're not sober ... Hold on , look , those paparazzi hopped my fence . What do you mean I 'm violent ? There is an emergency , and as captain I 'm obliged to investigate . Oh , wait , investigate what ? Yo , what happened ! We can 't disturb the body right now . Now , when we land ... The military police will board the plane and handle it from there . And that will be in ... Half an hour . Good . Half an hour . Captain , if you could please show your passengers , to the first class cabin , have them take a seat . Hey , Ren , what did you see ? She 's covered with blood all over . I cannot disagree with you more . I think we 're in for a lot of trouble . He 's not who he says he is . It 's totally suspicious . What do you want me to do ? Doesn 't this all seem a little sketchy ? That 's what I 'm saying . The only way right now is to land asap . So the authorities can take over . Look , captain , I think we should still land in Hong Kong . Who knows what a welcome party the so called base would be like . We need to land in Hong Kong . At least the Hong Kong military police and ocean airlines can co-operate . Peter ! Where 's Peter ? Kelly . Go find Peter , tell him I want to speak to him . Wait , Ruoxin . What now ? You know we can 't go where they want us to , right ? Then you tell me where . How about a crash landing at sea ? You don 't think my suspicions are grounded ? Uh , we just lost another person . That document could be forged . They just barricaded a crime scene , and Gao 's assistant is missing . These guys are hijackers . Have you got sufficient proof ? Even if it 's true , what can we do ? Fight unarmed , against two carrying hijackers ? Hey , except for the room where we found Lily 's body , I 've looked everywhere . I can 't find him anywhere . Well , the plane 's only so big , how can a walking , talking , human being , just vanish ? If even if he is walking and talking , I think it 's safe to say he 's in big trouble . Looks like Mr. chef 's becoming a pessimist . We were just attacked by some supernatural cats . Optimism is out the window at this point . You sure there 's anywhere else you haven 't looked ? I 've checked every room , every corner , unless ... Oh , my god . It can 't be . Aagh ! Anyone want a cellphone ? It 's one of those new hi-tech models . We got to tell the others . You like meddling in other people 's business , don 't you ? Not really , what a good chef should be doing ? Guess I was right about you . We 'll be landing soon . Try and behave until then . I know why you quit the military . Because you can 't kill . Now get up . Get up ! Move . Move to the front of the cabin . Everybody , sit tight ! We 'll be landing soon . How come there 's only one hostess here , where are the rest ? Everybody here is safe , except for in the cockpit . Mr. Gao , where is the rest of your crew ? I don 't , they ... When I went to find Peter , I sent the whole cabin crew down to cargo to look for him . Bring them up . What 's going on ? They 're hijacking the plane . He killed Peter , probably , Lily young too . Where exactly are you taking us ? You 've already tested my Patience once . And I 've got enough bullets in this gun for you , and everyone else on this plane . You better hope all those bullets hit the bone , because if you punch a hole in this plane , we 're all dead . Wait , wait ! What do you really want ? I told you . My headquarters ! And if we don 't land as planned , I 'll start executing hostages , starting with Mr. chef , as I 've grown to like him the least . You need me , to land this plane . I promise that won 't happen if you hurt anyone else . Whoa , whoa . Whatever your rush is to land this plane , killing the captain is not a good start . I know you 're right , Mr. chef . I 'll make you a deal , captain . Everyone 's safety for the promise that I get to go where I need to go ! Monica , Monica . Sit here . Give her water . Make her drink as much as she can , and don 't let her stop . Those wounds are full of poison . Okay , here . What 's all this ? The creatures made it on the plane . And they knew about it . That 's how Lily died . She 's the only one still alive . The rest of them should be like Lily young . One of those creatures are down there . I 've already sealed off the corridors . You got them killed . You should have warned us . Now we have to land , captain . If we don 't , this creature will kill everyone on this plane , one after another . And we can 't fight them in a metal bucket . Within the confines of this plane , one of them will kill all of us . They 're just too fast . So you 're using my people to feed them until we land ? They 're nocturnal , sensitive to light . But , if they can adjust to the brightness of this cabin , they 'll come after us . We have to go upstairs , all of us . The lounge is more lit up than anywhere else . All right , we can barricade the stairs in the corridor . We can 't wait for that . It 's not long till we land . Take me to the cockpit , captain . Watch everyone . Come on , Mike , take everyone upstairs . All right . Come on , let 's go . Hey , sit ! Hey , sit . Okay . Now , co-pilot ... Where are we ? There doesn 't seem to be any islands . The co-ordinates check out . There 's simply no land . Don 't worry about the land , just fly closer to the co-ordinates . But where are we going to land ? Just do whatever he says . Wow ! Yeah , there . Land there . No , no I can 't . Yes ! Hey . Sit down . Yes , you can . Landing an a390 on a carrier ? It 's impossible , the plane is too big . That carrier is a class one Nimitz , that 's three and a half football fields . She can handle it . No , I really can 't . Captain , you need to teach your crew how to follow orders . Land , now ! Hey , listen ... You can make it . Remember the carrier landing strips at school ? The competition , you beat me both times . But , it was a simulator . I practiced for months , and only succeeded twice . Pretend it 's the same training . Jason always thought of you as the most talented pilot . That 's pretty good . I 'm starting to like you more and more . Phew . Where is everybody ? This is suicide ! You knew the destination was an aircraft carrier , didn 't you ? Ruoxin 's crazy . I 'm beginning to think you 're crazy too . You 're gonna be okay , I promise . I , for one , think the lady captain 's pretty damn cool . A crash , it strikes me as a better way to go than being eaten . I 'm not gonna let her destroy a hundred million dollar plane . What the hell ? I think you should just stay right there . See , even at a time like this , all my father cares about , is his plane and his damn company ! Yeah , that 's all I got in this damn world , is my damn company , punk ! Yeah , I 've known that since I was ten ! If the plane crashes I will never see my dad again . I haven 't seen him for a long time . Who knew stress could make a face so pretty . You should really play , James Bond , man . Listen , I 'll give you one last chance to land . You have this , try again . I can 't . You have to ! The tiniest miscalculation , we 'll crash onto the bridge , or dive straight into the ocean . Let me do it . Are you sure you can do better ? Do we have any other choice ? You have control . I have control . Get ready . Locked . Deploy the landing gear . Pull up ! The starboard wing 's hit . It 's just the antenna . Hold fast . Monsters , and insane women . Please just be a nightmare . Ruoxin can land this plane . Everybody be ready to unbuckle ! As soon as we land I 'm opening this door , understand ? Take care of your girl , bro . Hey . What ? That 's for you . Let 's try , one last time . On my order , empty the fuel tank . Are you sure ? Affirmative . The reduced weight will shorten the landing distance . You better be right about that , captain . The plane is as wide as a carrier . Our wing will smash the bridge . If there 's any fuel left , the explosion destroys everything . But the engines can only last two minutes , if we empty the fuel . So , this is our last chance . Let 's do it ! Let 's fucking do it ! Remember ... Once we touchdown , go full flaps , and help me pull the speed brakes . What if we go over the deck ? There is no " what if " to this . Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo ! Come on , one at a time ! You take care of Mia . Don 't be afraid to run tight , go ! Get down ! Hold on tight ! The music . Kelly , come on , go . Go ! Mr. Kim , we have to go . Come on . We have to save him . Let 's go ! You keep going ! I can 't leave this plane . Argh ! Ruoxin ! Ah ... All right , I got you . Okay . I 'm so sorry , he was a hero . I should have been the last to leave . We have to live for him . For all of them . Come on . Hey , you two , get over here . What is this place ? You 'll find out later . You seem a little troubled . Things not going as planned . Shut up ! Everybody move to the edge . That way . Line up . And get down on your knees . I will not ask again ! Good . Welcome to the world 's largest aircraft carrier . It 's actually ... A shame that we don 't have any champagne to celebrate . But , if you follow my orders ... No one else has to die . If anyone moves , kill them . I 'm going down below to get our money . And you can see your son soon . Some of us are injured , and we need help . You 're right , captain . Help her up . You bastard ! She was already wounded ! All right ! There 's no need to kill anyone else . You have us right where you want us . You don 't get it , do you , chef ? None of you do . The creatures teeth are toxins , she had far too many wounds on her body , to survive more than an hour without the antidote . What I did ... Was reduce her pain . She should be grateful . Now , sit ... Back down . All of you . You watch them . Think about your son , and the money . Self destruct has been activated . Self destruct has been activated . Dr. Han , Dr. Han , hey ... What the hell happened here ? At last , you 're here . Listen , this is a soil sample from the cave . Where is my 20 million dollars ? Everyone died ... The specimens have mutated , they started to reproduce , and it 's all my fault . Listen , I know the company has been dumping funding into your research . So where is my money ? It 's too late . It 's going to explode . The nuclear power engines , all set on self destruct . Tell me where my money is ! It 's all over . You just go . No , uh ... Self destruct has been activated . He doesn 't care about your life . Shut up ! He 'll kill you as soon as he gets what he wants . He 's right . Think about the child on your necklace . Khadsa , what are you doing ? She 's going to kill you . Freeze ! The poison in her body is taking effect ! We need to stop the bleeding . Do you fly a helicopter ? Anything with propellers . What can 't you do , captain ? I 'll start the helicopter , you go find him . Wait , why do we have to go find him ? We should just leave . The guy 's a time bomb . Who knows if we 'll make it out of here as long as he 's around it 'd cause trouble . Go with chef , and help him . Okay . Mike , I 'll go with you . No , I 've served on an aircraft carrier before , I know the internal layout . I 'll be fine . Hey , come back soon . Of course , you haven 't tried my third dish yet . We 'll wait for you . Let 's go . Mr. Kim . Are you hurt ? Nothing serious . I just went to get my cello . Gentlemen , we need your help , go find the fuel . Self destruct has been activated . Self destruct has been activated . Where is he ? Power room , quick . Everywhere , be careful . Self destruct has been canceled . What 's happening ? What 's going on ? Destroy the ship , don 't let them reach land . You must stop him . I will . I just ... I just wanted to make a medicine , modifying genes . Reverse the growth of cancer cells . I 'm truly sorry . I went so wrong . They 're coming ! They 're coming , let 's go ! Let 's go ! We have to leave right now ! We 're not full yet . Come on , come on . Come on . Self destruct has been activated . That 's Nikki Lee 's gun . Never thought you 'd kill a woman , or anyone else for that matter . She 's safe . Put the gun down , slowly ! Self destruct has been activated . Self destruct has been activated . You think you can ruin my plan , chef ? Well , you can 't . I will find another buyer , and sell the soil sample for twice as much . You 're insane . You can 't win . Self destruct has been activated . Motherfuckers ! Come on ! Come on , let 's go , we gotta get out of here ! Dad ! Colin ! Dad . Don 't sell the company ! Dad , no ! No ! Climb , baby-climb climb , baby-climb climb , climb , climb , climb , aah ... Mike . Go as far as we can , the whole ship 's about to explode ! You know , my people have this tradition , if a woman does point a gun at them , you should marry her . Are you proposing , because I 'm Chinese , and I always have the last word . When this is all done , I think I 'm going to need a real vacation . Do you want company ? Yeah , I 'd like that . What do you have in mind ? Anywhere without cats . I think I 'm done cooking on an airplane . What about your third dish ? How about when we land ?

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... So you think the rock is a portal ? A crack in space-time that carried Simmons away ... to another planet . Fitz ! Which means ... She 's out there . Hydra 's fractured , in pieces . We 're gonna rebuild it ... the right way ... - What 's your way in ? - From below . Climb the ranks . Hail Hydra and all that . I 'm gonna nab a payload from these gunrunners to establish my cover . I get that you 're trying to build a life here ... Yes , a normal life , so stay out of it , I have created a special task force the ATCU , to neutralize these alien threats on our soil . Come with us . We 'll keep you safe . Your life is in danger . My life is in ruins . He 's moving north ! Use lethal force if necessary ! I 'm on his trail . Move it , move it ! There . Stop ! Fall back ! Unit two can try and head him off . But get her on the phone . Tell her we lost him . It 's time to bring everyone in on this . Simmons didn 't have to go through quarantine , which is good , all things considered . What exactly are these things that we 're considering ? Everything that comes with being on another planet for months . Different atmosphere , different levels of oxygenation , different microgravity . Every system in her body 's out of whack . Cardiovascular , inner ear , respiratory all got used to being ... not here . Labs indicate oxidative stress , vitamin D deficiency , upper-respiratory irritation . Any mention of life , intelligent or otherwise ? Some flora , no fauna . She said she was being hunted . Wait . What ? What does that mean ? Hunted by what ? She didn 't say . I don 't know if she even knows . ? My god . Imagine her having to go through all that alone for that long . Well , thanks to this guy , not anymore . Monitor her physical health . I 've got a call in to Dr. Garner . Her mental health is just as important . But don 't push her . She 'll open up when she 's ready . Lincoln 's in trouble . The ATCU issued a nationwide BOLO ... FBI , homeland security , local police ... all notified . Sent ' em Lincoln 's résumé and head shot . Sounds like the ATCU 's getting desperate . What are they gonna do when they find him ? I 'm guessing it won 't be awesome . He needs help . Look , we went to Lincoln more than once . He didn 't want our help . It doesn 't mean he deserves to be hunted like a fugitive , not to mention there 's a giant with a grudge looking to kill him . Which is why we need to bring him in - now . That would be the plan if we knew where to find him , But he 's not messaging me back , and I - What ? You want to tell her ? Great . Tell me what ? What do neither of you want to tell me ? We know how to find him . Lincoln , it 's me . Daisy ? How the hell did you get this number ? That 's not important . What 's important right now is that you get somewhere safe . I just bought this phone . Yes , I know . 35 minutes ago at a liquor store at 71st and Binford . You know where I am ? Yes , and I convinced them to let me talk to you before - I can 't believe you would do this . Just ... Lincoln , just hear me out , okay ? The ATCU has released your picture to law enforcement . It 's everywhere , calling for your arrest . We 're gonna come get you . Lincoln ? You 're not walking out of here till my partner has said her piece . He must have blown his tracker . Yeah , because he 's creeped out that you put a tracker in him . Yeah , and if she didn 't give him a heads-up , we could have used it to bring him in . He 's already scared , paranoid . Ambushing him out of nowhere would have made things way worse . And he would have been able to express those feelings to us here , secure in our location . All right , all right . Everybody , just relax . We 'll figure this out . He should be in here . We did a couple of jobs together a while back . He 's tight with Hydra in the U.K. And continued his association when he relocated here to the U.S. There he is . You lead . Spud . Why , here 's Richy ! As I live and breathe ! Working the bum fluff . Oh , G-Gina , Spud . Spud , Gina . Classy for the likes of you , eh ? Business associates . Come here . First round 's on me . Oi ! Oh , nice one . Uh , so , Richy tells us you 're the guy to go to if we need to unload ? - Hold your horses . That 's not how it 's done . First we drink , then we talk business . Three pints . Right , ' cause you guys aren 't hard enough to understand as it is . Yeah , you 're right . I did , didn 't I ? And , man , classic road trip . All right . He 's a muppet . But if we don 't start talking shop soon , he 's gonna pass out , so - You have something to unload ? Weapons - next gen , high potential damage . We need buyers with deep pockets and bad intentions . A finder 's fee for you , of course . I know people ... But they have massive trust issues . What do they want - a letter of recommendation ? Me vouching won 't be enough . Well , what is ? Do I buy my way in ? No . You fight your way in . If you are the last man standing , you 'll get a meeting . Sounds like a laugh . The suspect is considered dangerous . And he is wanted by both Federal authorities and the ATCU . This just went from bad to really , really bad . They 've gone public . If you do see this man , do not engage . In other news , a suspect has been identified in the Cincinnati hospital alien terrorist attack that left three dead , many more injured . If you have any information about the man pictured here , be sure to contact the authorities . You 're him . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I saw you . I know what you are . You have no idea . Daisy , I need you to monitor all law enforcement near Lincoln 's last known location . How about we take a team , go look for ourselves ? No , the ATCU 's on a witch hunt for powered people . I 'm not afraid of them . No , but they 're terrified of you , which makes them dangerous . Till we know where he is , you 're not going out there . Permission to speak freely . Do I have a choice ? I could have talked him in if you didn 't put an unsolicited tracker under his skin . If you didn 't call to alert him , then we - Why wasn 't I told ? We thought you were a little close to the situation . Of course I 'm close to the situation . You asked me to assemble a team , and I accepted . I didn 't expect to be undermined and - Do you know what I didn 't expect ? A global outbreak . The ATCU , their inhuman manhunt - I didn 't see all that coming , to be honest . I wanted to assemble a team , to get ahead of the problem , but that didn 't happen . So , Ddaisy ... I 'll scan law-enforcement channels . Thank you . Mack , you were able to identify Rosalind Price 's photo . How about getting me her digits ? You got it . Still acclimating to less gravity . Well , now , this is a sight for sore eyes . Thought it would be good to get back in the lab , see the old workspace . Is that it ? It was the portal . Now it 's a pile of space rocks . I 've run a complete and exhaustive set of diagnostics , so I can assure you there 's no need to worry . You okay ? - Fine . - Just a sec . It 's Hunter . He 's on a Ward hunt . Say " Hi . " You know it . Hey , look . Just as you left it - Made sure not even a post-it note was moved , 'cause I know how particular you can be about it . What is it ? Um , I 'm just ... I 'm not accustomed to this many distractions . Yeah , well , I imagine you must have had quite a lot to take in - extraterrestrial materials and specimens to examine . My curiosity faded once fear set in . Right . Yeah , no , of course . Sorry . Uh , I have to admit ... it 's all a bit much . Would you mind ? Uh , yeah . What should I get Bobbi ? No . Um , it 's just a little disorientation , attributable to oxidative stress . Okay , yeah , I 'll take you back to your room . I hope you 're not too disappointed . No , on the contrary , you 're self-diagnosing , which is a sign you 're on the mend . And how is she now ? As weirded out as you 'd be after being stranded for months - in another Solar System . - Oh , I must say - HQ sounds a lot more fun than what we 're up to . Now , why don 't I believe you ? And why do you sound hung over ? Because I am hung over . There 's nothing to do here but drink . Planes , trains , and automobiles , chasing down leads - Still no sign of Ward . So , you 're not doing anything stupid ? Mm , not yet . But one of those trains is about to leave the station , and I need to get on it . Well , good luck . Don 't die . Only thing I 'll die of is boredom . You lied to her . Barely . Besides , she knows I 'm lying , so it 's not even really a lie . Works for us ... For now . You know how complicated these things can be - Affairs of the heart , especially in our line of work . Me and Bob . You and Andrew . So , do you trust spud ? " Trust " ' s a strong word for a psychopath . He 's a murderous thief who I once saw bite a man 's nose clean off . But he 'll get us through the door . You 'll find this funny . Back at H.Q. , we 've got a little wager going on what happened between you and the good doctor . My guess is you walked away - not in a huff or anything , just couldn 't stand the constant talking , sharing . It 's true . I don 't like a lot of talking . This fight - it 's our way to Ward , so if you 're gonna do this , you need to win . Are you suggesting I can 't win ? I 'm not saying you can 't , but I know I can . Spud runs with a type . If that type see a small Asian woman destroy some wannabe Hydra thug in a bare-knuckle brawl , that type will talk . And word might spread up the ranks . I see your point . You 're just anxious to bash some heads after being out of the game . Look . I 've rarely lost a fight when I 'm sober , which I plan on being . And I can take a punch , so worst case , I 'll do that till the other guy tires out . So ... How much do you have riding on this bet that I left Andrew ? A significant sum . Well ... You lost it . Have you been drinking ? I wanted to . Instead , I called you . You 're the only one I trust . Get in . It 's a hell of a long way for a ride . I know . I 'll take care of the tolls on the way back . You slept the whole drive . I was pretty wiped out . Yeah , I was kind of hoping for the hilarious tale of why . You didn 't call to have me talk you off a ledge - Not this time , anyway . Linc , what 's going on ? Ah , I 'm in a little bit of trouble . You are killing me with these details . You don 't want to know . Look , it 's a misunderstanding . I promise you , I haven 't done anything wrong . Okay , that is all I need to hear . I know what kind of man you are . Just tell me what you need . I was hoping , uh ... You 'd let me buy your car off of you . I know it 's a lot to ask . Uh , I-I 'll pay cash . Done . John , I don 't know what to say . All right , now , wait a minute . You 're - you 're doing me a favor . It 's a pile of rust . All right , I 'll make us some dinner . I don 't know . Take a nap , or the shower 's over there , if you want to take a shower . Mi casa , su casa . It 's gonna be okay . He didn 't just disappear ... Unless he did . Well , he can 't do that , can he ? No . Electric 's his thing . He 'll show . That 's why we alerted the public . He 's got nowhere to hide . I hope so . We need to start making progogress , showing results . Ms. Price , you have a call . Well , it can wait . It 's the White House . Throw it up on my screen . Coulson . Call me " Phil . " What I can 't call you is POTUS . You 're not the only person with a connection to the White House . Well , mine 's a pirated satellite connection that will be discovered soon , so I 'll be brief . You 're making a lot of noise , and frankly , I 'm a little insulted . You 're asking everyone for help - The FBI , local police , and now the public - Everyone except the people who actually know something . - You mean you . - That is what I mean , yes . So , I think we should meet , just the two of us - In person , neutral ground . Uh , will you excuse me for a moment ? We have a location on Lincoln Campbell . He 's holed up in an apartment outside Chicago . You know what you need to do . Okay , Phil , let 's meet . I think we 'll have a lot to talk about . I cannot believe you 're here . Skye . Daisy . Sorry . It 's a multipurpose gift . It 's pretty and a reminder . You can call me whatever you want . I can 't stay for too long . I 'm tracking law-enforcement channels , but I am really sorry that I haven 't come sooner . It 's - there 's just a lot going on . - And I 've been sleeping . - Which is good . Do whatever you need to get better . We need you . And I ... I know you don 't want to talk about what happened yet , But when you do , I 'm here for whatever you need . Right now I 'd rather listen . The terrigen is spreading ? So 's the paranoia . Not exactly the penthouse view . You looking for something ? No , I just - It 's hard to relax , you know ? I know . Everything okay ? Why wouldn 't it be ? Maybe I will hop in the shower . John , what 's up ? What 's wrong ? You just stay where you are . Don 't touch me . Wait . What is going on ? They 'll be here any minute . Who did you call ? I called the hotline . They said that you 're dangerous . Lincoln , they said that you killed people . I never killed anyone - I swear . You said you know what type of man I am . I don 't even know what you are . They say you 're an alien . It 's not at all what you think . You just stay there . Stay there ! I 'm not kidding ! Stay there . They 're gonna be here any minute . Here . I 'm gonna leave the money and take the car . You don 't need to be involved . Just stay back ! Get out of my way ! Sorry I brought you into this . No . No , no , no , no . No , John . Come on , john ! You 're really okay ? I think so . I 'm ... Well , it 's just that ... There 's some of it that 's hard to talk about , and , um ... I am so sorry . No . Take it . Daisy . Lincoln , I am so sorry . I-I had no idea about the tracker , and if I did , I ... Don 't worry about that now . What 's wrong ? I need help . He 's not here . Lincoln 's hiding . He 's waiting for us . We need to bring him in , preferably without the ATCU knowing . Even though he just killed a guy . I told you ... it was an accident . We 'll figure it out once we get him in here . It 'd be safer if Mack handled the extraction . I know , but then he won 't come . It 's got to be me . Your call . And where are you going ? To the beach . I 'd give anything to be in the field . Rehab is the antithesis of exciting ... I 'm well-aware , but it 's worth it . You notice I was able to say " antithesis . " You check on Simmons ? Yeah . She 's kind of ... distant . I 'm not sure that I know how to help her . What did you drill into my head when I started rehabbing my knee ? - Patience . - Exactly . Yeah , I know . I know . It 's just the lab ... she loved that lab , designed it according to her specifications . Now it 's ... Could be it reminds her of the way things were And all the time she lost . Yeah . I didn 't think of that . Maybe forget about the things that used to matter to her . Give her something to look forward to . Start fresh . Yeah . Yeah , maybe you 're right . Thanks . Got to say , I was pretty surprised when I got your call . Eyes up here . Busted . Sorry . I appreciate you taking the time . Gave me an excuse to drive up the coast . Does she have a name ? I love my car , but it 's just a car . And it 's a him . You know , last time we met , you , uh , disarmed me with your evasive tactics . I see what you did there . No , I got to hand it to you . Makes me wonder what else you got up your sleeve . No , really , I get it . Hard to resist . I assume I 'm not the first . I think you are . It 's fairly recent . Sorry . That can 't be easy . That 's not what we came here to discuss . You 're going about this all wrong . Panicking the public ... not wise . Keep doing that , things are gonna get ugly real fast . Back him off ! He 's done ! We got a winner ! That 's right ! All right , he 's done , get him out of here ! Next man up , let 's go , come on ! Is he breathing ? There . Are you good ? I 'm not the one who needs to be good . Richy 's here . We can get started . Who 's the unlucky sod , then ? What the hell are you doing ? Shutting your stupid face up once and for all . All right . In position . Are you having a laugh ? I thought we were mates . You thought wrong , you mug . All right . Oh , is there any rules I should know about before we start ? Nope . We was having a laugh . I wasn 't laughing . Not even on the inside ? Let me get you a drink . I 'm not thirsty . Let 's try that again . A drink ? And again , no . Come on . I promise you 'll have a good time . Come on . So ... Who 's first ? How about I do you a favor and not tell anyone that a tiny , little asian woman kicked your ass ? Are you not tired yet ? Because that was sort of my strategy . Come on . Is somebody gonna call it ? What 's the point ? He 's not breathing . You know , my agency exists because yours imploded . But we came back , albeit with less real estate and a lower profile . The low profile 's the problem . No one knows you exist , but bizarre events keep happening . And people need to feel safe . So all these APBs on alien threats ... those are to help people feel safe ? Look , the truth is , you don 't understand what you 're dealing with . And you do ? Which is why I 'm asking you to let my team bring Lincoln in . If we take him , it 'll be easy . If you do it , people could get hurt . That might be the case , but ... I 'm sorry . I can 't agree to that . Coast is clear . It 's me . You 're having a hell of a day . I , um ... I killed him . John , um , he saved my life more than once . And now I couldn 't bring him back . Everything they 're saying about me is true . He 's extremely dangerous . He won 't be if he 's in our custody . We 're not gonna harvest him for parts , if that 's what you 're worried about . We 're not Hydra . You say that now . What 's so important about him ? Are you serious ? He can bring down a plane . Feels like a man worth talking to . I have another theory . The president makes a big speech about this new organization he 's put in place . I imagine that puts a lot of pressure on you ... Pressure to show results . You 're not wrong . And that 's why I 'm taking him in . But why are we here , Phil ? Are we waiting to watch the sunset together ? 'cause if you didn 't come here to make a deal , then what do you want ? You have an ace up your sleeve , and I 'm tired of waiting for you to play it . Is that so ? You have surveillance from the hospital , which means there 's another picture you chose not to put on TV . A pretty face with no name , no birth record , no social attached to it . She 's one of them . And she works for you , right ? What do I need to do to keep this quiet ? You know what I want . Fine , they 're right ... you 're dangerous . I 'm dangerous . But that 's not who you are . You ... You 're wrong . - I know the real you , Lincoln , and you ... - You don 't . The man who killed his only friend , Who had to be saved from himself over and over ? That 's the real me . That 's who I really am . Not when I met you . You gave me hope , a place in the world . Look what happened to it . You know better than anyone , if ... if everything around you crumbles , then you 're the cause . Stop ! You don 't see it , but I do . You ... you help people because you were meant to . You can do that with us , like you were doing at the hospital ... saving lives . That part of my life is over . No , you ... you are not cursed . You are not some horrible thing . I know ... Because you taught me that I wasn 't . You convinced me that I had a purpose , that maybe my life wasn 't over , but just ... getting somewhere . Please let me do the same for you . You 're wasting your time caring about me . I can 't help it . I 'll go in with you . I 'm not agreeing to work with S.H.I.E.L.D. , but with you . We 'll figure it out together . Great . Is the , um , escape module on its way ? Change of plans . Coulson 's orders . We 're turning him over to the ATCU . Get Coulson on the phone . He said he 'd explain back at headquarters . Daisy , what 's happening ? But Coulson told me to let you know that you 're gonna be safe . He 's arranged for us to observe and make sure ... Can we get on with this ? This is crazy ! He said he didn 't have a choice . Take him into custody . Suspect 's on the move . Seal off the street . Awaiting orders . - Should we go after him ? - No . Bird in the hand . We take her . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Following orders . Do you really think you can stop me ? Do you have any idea what I can do ? Yeah . That 's why I have three snipers outside , ready to engage . What 's the range on these powers of yours ? How good are they ? Actually , pretty damn good . Tell your men to stand down . I can 't do that . He got away , and I 've made assurances . I assure you that if you insist on taking my agent in , you will start a war . I will devote all the resources and manpower of S.H.I.E.L.D. to crushing your agency . It 's not personal . It 's work . And right now I need to show results . What if Ii offer something better ? Copy that . I guess it 's your lucky day . We 're done . Let 's go . I thought it 'd be good for you to get out somewhere nice ... and quiet . Where is everyone ? Well , I made sure you wouldn 't have any distractions . Mr. Fitz , we 're delighted to see you . Your table is this way . The wine is a gift from us . A very persistent young man here . We 've been holding this reservation for months . I 'm delighted you 're finally here . You kept the reservation . Don 't make a fuss . It 's not a big deal . I remember when you took me out after months in the hospital . It made me feel like a human being again . You complained the entire time . Well ... Okay , a crabby human being . I can 't thank you enough . Yeah . It 's a nice restaurant , isn 't it ? Yeah , but for more than that ... for finding me . What else was I gonna do ? I don 't know what to say . You don 't have to say anything . Have you decided what you 'll be having ? Oh , gosh . So much ... to choose from ... Maybe this will help . Should I make a toast ? What ? Can you give us two minutes ? Of course . Help me understand . It was not an easy decision . To hand Lincoln over ? I had to make a choice . So it was him or me . They have your picture , Daisy . So why didn 't they take me ? Once Lincoln left , how did you convince them not to take me in ? I offered them something just as valuable . - What ? - Me . My expertise . So ... so now we 're working with them ? I 'm done fighting with people over who gets to fight the real fight . It 's a colossal waste of time and resources . I went against Talbot . I went against another faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. We know what we 're doing ... they don 't . Hopefully , they can learn from us . It is hard to trust them when they are hunting people like me . I never said I trust them . Good . Don 't , because we have no idea what they 're really after . Duly noted . Look I understand this is a personal matter for you . So Mack told you what he heard me say ? And what would that be ? It 's Rosalind . First-name basis , huh ? I 'll leave you to it . Well , I 'm surprised to hear from you so soon . Just checking , making sure you didn 't give me a fake number . You all right ? I 've been better . Thanks for not saying anything . You know what ? I sure could use some backup . Let 's see what kind of skills you got , kid . All right . Well , you certainly don 't make it easy to get a meeting . The boss doesn 't want it to be easy . But he 's always interested in meeting people who can prove themselves . Sounds like an interesting bloke . I look forward to meeting him someday . We 'll return in a moment . Simmons ? Why are you looking at that ? Trying to understand . There 's nothing to learn from this . It 's possible it 's not inert . Alien metals have different properties . We don 't know for sure . Yes , we do . You 're safe . That portal won 't open again . But it has to . I have to go back .

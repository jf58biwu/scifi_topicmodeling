 The day that changed my life . The day that changed my life wasn 't a day but a night . It was Halloween night . I was Buffalo Bob , and I had the real cowhide vest . It was 1960 , and I lived in Holden , Kentucky . I loved Zagnut bars , and my sister Ellen loved Baby Ruth bars . My brother Tuggah loved everything . I don 't love Halloween anymore . It was the night my mom , my brother , and my sister was murdered ... With a hammer . I remember the blood smelled like pennies . My father killed everyone but me . I don 't like to remember it , but I can 't forget it . The end . I know it isn 't very ... long . Harry , that ... that 's a powerful story . Thank you for sharing that with us . Now , why was this good ? Because when we heard it , we knew him . It was honest . What Harry wrote was very painful . The truths probably made us all feel a little uncomfortable . Because of that , it was ... It was very powerful . Let me see that . Boom . Good job . Good job . Thanks . Bye . See you . Harry , hey , that was ... That was something . I never got an A + before . Well , congratulations . Can I ask you a question ? Yeah . I 'm going for a promotion . Can you write a letter to the principal ? Only if you promise to give me a raise as soon as you 're running this place . - Yeah . - All right , see you .

I do make a diet burger . It 's called a salad . Right . " His eyes were like two round , blue circles with another black circle in the middle " ?

I wrote to Helene when I heard about your dad . Did you get a chance to talk to him before ? He died when I was on the plane to see him . I 'm sorry . There 's three sets to sign . One for you , one for me , and one for the lawyer . Need a pen ? I signed already . Right . Always prepared . You doing any writing these days ? Nope . I always loved your writing . There you go . Believe it or not , I wish you all the best . Christy . I wish you the best too . Al ? Get out of here . Al , you all right ? Just go home . Are you okay ? Jesus Christ . What happened to you ? I 'm fine . You 're not fine . You look like crap . Go on . What the hell 's going on ? What happened to you ? Ah , shit . Al , Al , Al ! Maybe you should take one of those pills the doctor gave you so you can get some sleep . I 'll start calling the numbers on that list of in-home nurses . Just forget it . I don 't need a nurse .

In the 1930s , researchers began experimenting with a number of so-called shock therapies meant to reroute the circuitry of the diseased brain ... Patients were brought to the breach of death ... Cody . What the fuck ? Through an intentional overdose of the hormone insulin . Others were given ... All right , real quick . Why do we think the filmmakers chose to document these conditions ? If you look at the patient writings after this ... People tend to think the important stories are wars , elections , political movements , but these people matter . Little things matter . All right , I 'll see you tomorrow . Bye , Carrie . Bye . - Cody ? - Yeah ? What 's holding your attention on this little screen ? Uh , here , look . I could send you the clip if you want it .

You want me to go in the closet , look around , spend as much time as I need ? - I know I sound batshit , okay ? - Yeah .

Oh , for the love of Mike . ♪ " Stay Just a Little Bit Longer " by Maurice Williams ] You shouldn 't be here . You shouldn 't be here . Do you hear me ? Huh ? You shouldn 't be here ! What the fuck was that ? That was October 21 , 1960 . No , it wasn 't . Now you understand why I needed you to go in there . What are you saying ? What are you saying , this is a ... Hard to find the right words , I know . But you go through there , and it 's 1960 . You 're saying this is a time portal ? I call it a rabbit hole . How long has it been there ? Since I had the diner . Who else knows about it ? Just you . If I told anyone else about it , they might try to stop me . They 'd try to stop you ? What are you talking about ? Al , why did you show this to me ? I need you to do what I couldn 't . I need you to go back there to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy . You heard about the butterfly effect ? - Yeah . - All right . Do you think that if JFK lived , Robert Kennedy would 've run for president , seriously ? It 's doubtful . So , if Bobby doesn 't run , that means no Sirhan Sirhan at the Ambassador Hotel in 1968 . Save JFK , save his brother . And that 's what I mean about the butterfly effect . Then there 's Vietnam . Uh , okay , so if you save JFK , then there 's no Vietnam ? Johnson was the one who escalated everything in Nam . If Kennedy had survived , no way does that escalation continue . Those boys ... would 've lived . Al , I get it , but changing the past to make it how you think it should be just seems ... You think Vietnam unfolded exactly as it should have , that recent American history was just hunky-dory ? Saving JFK is a theory . You don 't know what it 's gonna change ! You know what I know ? You save Kennedy 's life , you make the world a better place . God damn it ! Al . Don 't you want to do any fucking thing that matters ? I 'm just saying you don 't have any proof . You don 't know that what you do in the past is gonna change anything here . Go see . You check for yourself . What do you want ... Y-you want me to go stab someone ? No , Jake . There 's a tree out there . Carve something in it . Jesus Christ . Oh , God damn . Fucking ... Goddamn ... Stupid thing . I hate the fucking dark . Hey , batter , batter ! Oh , for the love of Mike . You shouldn 't be here . - I want to tell you something . - Back off , okay ? Next time you go through , that carving won 't be there . Why ? Each time you go in , everything resets . It 's always 11 : 58 on October 21 , 1960 . You saw how everything looked exactly the same ? Yeah . No matter how long you stay ... Three weeks , three years ... When you come back , only two minutes will have passed here . Two minutes ? Who makes up these rules ? I 'm just explaining that , if you want to change something forever , you can 't ever go back . Going back erases what you did before . All right , who 's the guy with the hat and the yellow card ? He 's some bum . Well , he got up in my face . I mean , he seemed to be the only one that noticed me come and go . Just forget the yellow card man . He 's not important . What 's important is that we have a chance here . A chance to change people 's lives . I saw you sitting there with Christy , and I knew you could do this . What are you talking about ? That 's the last time I went through . Stayed about ... About two years . Two years ? While I signed my divorce papers ? - That was ... - Two minutes , yeah . It doesn 't make any sense . It doesn 't make any sense . Jake , the way the world is now doesn 't make any sense . Just think about it , eh ? You know how to think , don 't you ? Marisol Breslin . Congratulations , Marisol . Hector de la Fuente . That idiot always schedules these goddamn things on a Friday . Maureen Kelly . We can 't send diplomas in the mail ? How long have you worked here , Alice ? I went here . Wow . Harry Dunning ! Harry ! All right . Harry ! He 's a great writer . I 'll look for his work in " The New Yorker . " Did you get my recommendation ? Listen , you love Harry . I love Harry . We all love Harry . He 's great at pushing a broom , but at management , making a schedule , signing time sheets , no way . All these graduates are starting new lives ! Yeah ! That 's it . I 'm off the clock . Let 's hear it for all our adult education graduates for all their hard work . All right . Tell me more . Come here . Holy shit . I thought you didn 't have any hobbies . Who do you think killed Kennedy ? People seem to think it was Lee Harvey Oswald . Yeah . You know , in a conspiracy with the mafia , CIA , FBI , the Russians , babushka lady on the grassy knoll . Lot of books written about it . Most of them written about Lee Harvey Oswald . Guy doesn 't make sense . U.S. Marine , defected to Russia , came back , but everyone who wrote about Oswald studied him after the assassination . I saw him before . I saw him when he came back from Russia . In 1962 . What the hell are you staring at ? - Nothing . - Yeah , well , mind your own . Why didn 't you shoot him right there ? I don 't know whether Oswald was the man who did it , and I still don 't know . Not gonna shoot someone because of maybe . There are hundreds of questions that haven 't been answered concerning Oswald and that day . This is a ... this is a big one . Who 's this ? Walker . Ran for Texas governor . You know that in 1963 , six months before Kennedy was shot , there was an assassination attempt on this man ? Okay . Bullet came from a 6.5 caliber Carcano rifle . Same exact make of gun that killed Kennedy . Well , did you go back and see Oswald shoot at Walker ? - That 's what I want you to do . - How ? I want you to make it to April 10th , 1963 . And if Oswald fires that gun alone , you got to take him out . Hold on , what are we even talking about here ? We 're talking about seeing if Oswald took a shot at Walker . I go back through the rabbit hole , I come out in 1960 . You want me to hang out for three years ? - Two minutes here . - What am I gonna do in 1960 ? I 'm nothing there . How am I gonna ... How am I gonna live ? I 'm glad you asked . What 's this ? Treasure chest ? James Amberson ? See , you can still answer to Jake if you want . This is for me ? You 're welcome . Social security card , birth certificate , charge cards . Everything you need to hold a job , blend in . Al , when did you do this ? I got diagnosed in 1962 . You made all this when you were back there ? Here 's the most important thing . Sports stats ? Yeah , baseball and boxing mostly . This is how you survived ? You spent all your time back there gambling ? That , and there was a butcher I liked on Main Street . How do you think I keep my prices here so low ? That 's what you 've been feeding me ? I 've been eating hamburgers from 1960 ? Yeah . Al ... I don 't know who you think I am . I just don 't think I 'm the right guy for this . I know you are . That 's about all I know . You 'll figure out the rest when you get there . Let 's ... let 's go . Go where ? To the diner . I 'll watch you go through . I can wait two minutes . Two minutes to get a better world . I have to think about all this . What 's there to think about ? Okay ? Hm . Yeah . Oh , yeah . And what a waste of fucking time . What ? I can see how this is gonna go . " Oh , my car needs an oil change . " " Got to give a ... Give a big test . " " Got to go take a nap . " Anything to avoid doing something real in your life . Al , this is ... I 've been up all night listening to fucking crazy ... I thought maybe for once ... This is fucking crazy ! You might do something , not just talk about it . Just because you wasted your life on this , it doesn 't mean that I have to . You little shit . Get the fuck out of my house . Get out . Al ? Al ? Sorry about last night . Couldn 't sleep . Al ? Shit . Okay , buddy . I 'll see you in two minutes . Here I go . Careful . Shouldn 't be here . Keep telling you , you shouldn 't be here . Well , I 'm here . You 'll need to blend in , so get your hair cut and get rid of the stuff on your face . It 's not gonna work . Looks like you 're overdue . Yeah , I guess so . From out of town ? Uh , yes . James Amberson . - Amberson ? - Mm-hmm . Are those the Ambersons over in Castle Rock ? No . You know , my wife 's cousin married an Amberson , but he was from New Hampshire . Those are your people ? Actually , I was adopted . Huh . Get the right clothes . Back then grown men wore suits and hats . When I vote , it comes down to character . - Mm-hmm ? - Richard Nixon has it . You look at him , you think " that 's a good man . " Yeah . Perfect . Cash or credit , sir ? Oh , uh , cash . Can I have a hat too , please ? Certainly . Thanks . Hey , food tastes better .

Henry , don 't eat with your fingers . Here you go . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Oswald doesn 't get back from Russia for two years . And in 1963 , somebody shoots at General Walker . In the meantime , there are plenty of other leads to follow . On October 26th , follow George . Just go where he goes , then you 'll understand . Who the hell is George ? That tastes like snot . Yeah . George de Mohrenschildt , Russian expat . He 's educated , charming , rich , belongs to the Dallas Petroleum Club , and in 1962 , he becomes Lee 's best friend . We heard there was a couple , moved here from ... Russia , and they were having a very bad time , financially , and so I went to see them . Tell me , Jake , why is this guy hanging out in Lee 's shitty apartment ? They 're swingers ? Lee had taken the cigarette from her and had put it out on her shoulder . If Oswald had a handler , it was him . All right , hold on . You lost me . A handler ? What ... what does that mean ? George told Oswald to shoot Kennedy ? If Lee was set up , then George was the only guy who could 've done it . You need to cross off that possibility . All right , and if I do that , then what ? Then you kill Oswald . Where the hell are you going , George de Morenfuck ? Lyndon Johnson and I do not promise a life of ease . We cannot promise a solution to the problems which disturb our lives . But we can promise that if we are successful , we shall move with vigor and vitality on the problems which disturb us here and around the world . Thomas Paine ... Thomas Paine , in the revolution of 1776 ... - Isn 't he wonderful ? Yes . - Yeah . Said that the cause of America is the cause of all mankind . I think in the revolution of 1960 that the cause of all mankind is the cause of America . And as we move ahead , we think not only of the City of Dallas and the City of Boston , the State of Massachusetts and the State of Texas , the United States . We think of all those who wish to join us in a great effort around the world to maintain their freedom and maintain the peace . We ask your help in this campaign . Give us your voice . Give us your help . Join with us in this effort to move this country ahead . Just checking in . Uh , Al Templeton . I don 't see that name here . Oh , I 'm a guest of George de Mohrenschildt . He doesn 't like my name on any lists . I assure you he 'll be very upset if I don 't make this appointment . Thank you . Yes , a little bit . I 'll take one of those . Your suit collar looked lonely . Oh , then you should give me two . You like working for the campaign ? I think Senator Kennedy is the one person who 's really , really gonna make a difference . Yeah . Oh , could I get one ? Of course . Oh , thank you . - Oh , look , Jackie 's here . - There she is . - Mrs. Kennedy ! - Mrs. Kennedy , a photo , please ? One more . - Mrs. Kennedy ? - Mrs. Kennedy ! Jackie , Jackie . Hey , you shouldn 't be here . Oh , no , I 'm just waiting for George . Yeah , just come with me , okay ? Oh , no it 's okay . Oh ! Let 's go . Stop him ! - Over there ! - Hey , hey , hey , stop ! Going that way ! I don 't know , I don 't see him ! He 's got to be in here ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Wakey , wakey , sunshine . Let 's go . James Amberson from Maine . - Yeah . - Pretty far from home . Yeah , I just came to see the president . I mean , senator Kennedy . Well , you scammed your way into the senator 's VIP room . There are people out there who don 't like the Kennedy campaign . Well , that 's not me . I love the guy . Well , why did you give a fake ID ? And then run away ? That looks bad . I 'm not interested in spending the rest of the night in this basement . Who are you ? Why were you in the VIP room ? Why are you here ? - Is he still here ? - Who ? JFK , uh ... Jack ... is on the right track . I 'm gonna be honest with you guys . I came out here to shake the man 's hand . I just think he is the best that this country has to offer , all right ? Get ready for greatness . And that speech ? Did you hear ? You heard it , right ? I mean , you heard that speech . I-I just wanted to tell him face-to-face that I am a believer . Do you know what I 'm talking about ? Shut up , for the love of God . Do you know what I 'm talking about ? Just shut up , shut up . I mean , can you blame me for wanting to tell the guy I 'm gonna vote for that I 'm a believer ? You can 't arrest me for enthusiasm , right ? There 's no law against that . Actually , you 're wrong about that . And if I catch your enthusiastic ass near Kennedy 's campaign again , we 'll bring you up on charges . Don 't go places you 're not invited . Okay , right . Um ... Will you just do one thing for me ? Just tell him that I 'm his number one fan . Will you do that ? Sure . Thank you , all right , thank you . Okay , see you later . So George de Mohrenschildt might be an informant , might work for Russia . He 's got interests in Haiti , pals around with Duvalier ; who knows what else . He told a reporter in 1977 that it was the CIA who gave him Oswald 's address . And then he was asked to testify in front of the House Committee on Assassinations . Next day ? He committed suicide . Supposedly . I followed him while I could in 1960 . And there was one night ... One night I realized was actually an important night . Because I felt the past push back . He took his wife Jean out to dinner at El Conejo . All the movers and shakers in Dallas ate there . Best Tex-Mex place in town . First thing I felt was an argument outside the restaurant got out of hand . Don 't get drawn in . You need to get the hell out of the way . His wife goes off to the bar and he heads into the restaurant alone . - May I take your coat , sir ? - No , it 's fine , thank you . The fella out front is gonna say , " No tables available . " Sorry , sir , without reservation we won 't be able to ... So have cash . Oh , I think I can help you . Can I take your coat , please ? No , it 's fine , but may I have that table right there so I can be close to the band ? Of course . - Thank you very much . - You 're very welcome . This is where you want to be careful , because one minute , I was walking down the stairs , and the next , I was on fire . Sent me to the hospital , and it kept me from following de Mohrenschildt all the way into the restaurant . I never got to see who he met with . Oh ! Be careful . Are you okay ? I 'm so sorry , señor . Yeah , I 'm fine . - Your coat . - Yeah , just leave it . - Are you sure ? - Yeah , it 's okay . Once you 're past the fire , I can 't help you anymore . You 're on your own . Oh , my God . I 'm so sorry . Are you okay ? - Are you okay ? - I don 't know what 's going on tonight . I 'm so sorry . We 'll clean that up right away . Maestro , musica . Your table . I 'm so sorry . Could I get you a cocktail ? It 's on the house . - Oh , uh ... margarita . - Right away . Of course , I 've always admired Allen Dulles . None of this , you understand , is completely on the books . A man like me wants his life to matter . Señor , here 's your margarita , and are you ready to place your order for your first ... I 'll order later . Of course , señor , may I make a suggestion of the special ? - Late , later , not hungry now . - Of course , señor , of course . Take your time . It 's a short list . Just a couple guys we 'd like to know a little bit more about . We 've been instructed by Langley to meet with prospective assets such as yourself . He 's still angry about Stalin seizing his estates . Antonov , no . Belinsky sometimes complains about the U.S. but knows he has it good . Lee Harvey Oswald ? He 's a nobody . I 'll let you know what I learn . We 'll be in contact . No one knows when George first met with the CIA . But the CIA recruited him . This we know . What we don 't know is if George recruited Oswald to kill Kennedy . - Oh ! - Oh ! I 'm sorry . I-I 'm sorry . Holy shit , that was the CIA . That was the Goddamn CIA . You were right , Al . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Aah ! - No , stop . - No , all my stuff is in there . Stop , just stop . No , no , no ! Help him ! Henry ! Oh , why ? Oh , how can ... My son ! Oh , shit . Shit , shit , shit . Sir , you shouldn 't be here . Yeah , know what , you 're right . I shouldn 't be here . I can 't do this . There are beds available down at the shelter . No , I 'm done . I 'm going back to Maine . The day that changed my life wasn 't a day , but a night . It was Halloween night . It was the night my father murdered my mom and my brother and my sister with a hammer and hurt me bad . It was 1960 . I lived in Holden , Kentucky . Hey , mister . You lost ? How far is Holden ? Yeah , turn around . Head south down Route 13 for about 30 miles . Not much of a town , though . Why 'd you want to go there ? 'Cause I might be able to do one thing . Thank you very much . Bang , got you , you 're dead . Come on , Ellen , now you 're dead . Aah ! Ellen , for goodness sakes , turn down the drama . The neighbors are gonna think someone 's dying over here . Daddy ! Hey , don 't suppose any of you kids want any ice cream , do you ? - I do ! - You do ? Come here ! Come here , Buster . All right , let 's get in there . You guys in the back . You 're looking beautiful , Doris . Have them home by 6 : 00 . Come on , Harry . What , you don 't like ice cream ? Come here , you . Come here , you . You 're going in the front . You 're going in the front . You 're going in the window . Get in there , get in there .

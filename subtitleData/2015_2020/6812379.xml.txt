 Previously on " Aftermath " ... Kids , meet Grandpa . I witnessed them murder some people . Your father ordered my death . He dragged me somewhere . She didn 't do anything . That means ... Shapeshifter . Get away from my family ! [ yells ] Which is which ? [ gunshot ] Take this . It 's tetra . You might need it . - [ coughs ] - Josh . [ dramatic music ] Has anyone noticed the Moon today , my people round the steeple of the temple of the dog ? It 's got me running , flying , sanctifying , praying that those brand-new daytime stars are what they seem and not some nightmare dream of death . - Hey . - Don 't . Do you know where the extra water jug is ? No . Don 't do that . - Hey , Dad ? - Yeah . We 're out of water . Well , Idaho has vast amounts of water . I 'm sure we 'll find some . [ clears throat ] How you feeling , Dad ? Never better . And who will say that ... Oh , my God . All right , pop quiz . Fun facts about Idaho . I grew up here . It has more ghost towns than anywhere else in the country . - That is correct . - There is no country anymore . That is incorrect , Matt . Jeez , since when are you the buzzkill ? I thought that was Dana . Yeah , that was really out of character , Matt . Maybe I 'm a shapeshifter . You are not . I 'd know for sure . Dana wouldn 't . What are you talking about ? I saved you . You were aiming at me , not her , Dana . You missed . - Oh , Bree , come on . - Not cool . I saw a wild blueberry bush over here . Anybody want to come help me pick ' em ? - Go for it . - Maybe later ? Hey , hey ! I guess we 'll do it . Hey , look . Why are stars out in the daytime ? Those aren 't stars . I 've been watching ; they 've changed position . They 're visible in the daylight , which means they 're hundreds of miles across and possibly on fire . Asteroids . They 'd be millions of miles off course , though . And that 'd be ... bad . Matt , when is it not bad ? God . But these ones won 't hit us . They 're actually kind of pretty . - Right , Mom ? - Yeah , they are pretty . Guys ! Guys ! [ ominous music ] ♪ ♪ What happened to these people ? They look stretched . His eyes are a different color . ♪ ♪ What the hell is this ? I don 't know . He 's , like , ten feet long . - Why is he , uh ... - Dad ? Stretched ? I-I don 't know . Dad . There 's only three bodies here . Where 's the little boy ? [ tense music ] ♪ ♪ 1 : 42 . [ coughing ] [ music intensifies ] ♪ ♪ [ ominous music ] This is the place , the medical warehouse . Okay , everyone , stay sharp for Feverheads and Gls . No one gets between us and the tetra . If there 's any left . Just go . Watch your step , Dad . I 'm sure I 'm fine . We don 't need to stop . Like hell we don 't . Spread out . Safeties off . Stay focused . I don 't need tetra . You need it , and you need it soon . Dad , be careful . Let 's move , guys . Hey , what ... what 's this ? [ sighs ] There 's nothing . There 's no more tetra stacks ? What 's ... sugga-ma-dex ? " Sugammadex . " It reverses neuromuscular blockade . Awesome . And completely useless . Tetra , Dana . We need tetra . This disease is weeks old . Nobody knows where it started or how it spreads . Just ' cause one antibiotic works doesn 't mean others won 't . Great , and while you conduct your drug trials , we lose our dad . Screw you , Dana . [ sighs ] So ... you , uh ... Want to talk ? What Dana said in the bar , she was drunk . No , she wasn 't , Matt . Okay , fine . But you always win these things . We 're all afraid of what 's gonna happen to Dad , but you can 't take it out on Dana . I 'm not , okay ? [ sighs ] You realize we haven 't seen a single person in this town ? Kind of reminds me of the Chernobyl level in " Frontal Assault 4 . " How can you be thinking about video games right now ? - Please . - Oh , my God , you 're such a dude . You loved " FA4 " as much as I did , probably more . I mean , you and Dana always kicked my ass . You were so overconfident . I mean , come on ; there 's no way in hell you 're winning a two-against-one death match . Like , no way . Oh , I can win two against one . No , you couldn 't . It was just the two of you . You guys got good instincts . I mean , both of you but ... you especially . Yeah , well , you were super overconfident . We would have kept kicking your ass too if Dad didn 't make us stop . - He 's so stupid . " Too violent , guys . " - " Too violent . " [ laughs ] So do you think what happened in Seattle happened here , then ? I don 't know . Okay , well , New York 's gone . LA 's gone . Matt , everybody we meet dies , and we 're still standing here . Why is that ? Never thought about it . I 'm gonna go check on Dad . You stay here with the stacks , look for some tetra . I bet if anybody finds it , it 's you . All right . He 's gone ! Oh , shit . He could be anywhere by now . [ tense music ] [ various voices ] Everything dies . [ various voices ] No . - Dad ! - Dad ! - Josh ! - Dad ! - Dad ! - Bree ! Guys , over here . [ various voices ] Matt . Got it . Kids , keep looking for the tetra . Honey . Come on , guys , let 's go . Can I have your gun ? Please ? We have to face it , Josh . I know it 's the plague . Yes . We 're just ... we 're just being careful for the kids . Yeah , of course . We 'll find some tetra , make everything okay . - We 're gonna find it . - Yeah . I 'm sorry I didn 't get my dad 's . Karen , no . The odds are that it was poisoned . Yeah , he said it wasn 't . Well , he ... also your father ordered my execution . He couldn 't be trusted , so ... Thank you . - Mom ! - Yeah . I found something . Let 's get your dad to the RV . Okay , what is it ? It 's a tetra box . A tetra box . It 's empty . But look at the address . Coastal Cross Long-Term Care , uh-huh . So ? It 's a few blocks away . We passed it . But if they took regular deliveries ... Then they may still have some there . Yes . Exactly . Here it is , Coastal Cross Long-Term Care Facility . Girls , you 're with me . We 're gonna go room by room . - What about me ? - Stay with your father . Keep an eye on him . It could take us hours . We don 't know when he 's gonna become a danger to himself . - All right . - Stay with him no matter what ... But not up here ; you 're too open . Go down the hill . Go someplace private . We 'll meet you there when we 're done . Let 's go . Honey , I 'm doing this to keep you safe . I love you . I 'm coming back . Hurry . [ intense dramatic music ] Okay , it 's their pharmacy . Let 's hope the tetra 's in there . I 'll stand watch . You guys look in there . - I got nothing . - Me neither . Shit ! There should be a dispensary on each floor . Let 's go . Matt ? Hey , Matt . Come sit here . Come sit here . I can talk . I 'm not sure how long that 's gonna last , but ... I can talk now . I ... I ... if ... If they don 't find any tetra ... I don 't want to hear this . Just remember ... No , Matt , listen . Look , if ... I just need you to ... Take the ... tomato train to the REO Speedwagon ... That 's ... wait . [ stammering ] No , I want to ... I want ... Wait . What 's his name ? What 's his name ? What 's his name ? Okay , what now ? We search every floor and don 't stop until we find tetra . [ squeak ] Do you hear that ? - [ yells ] - [ screams ] [ gunshot ] Don 't even think about it . This is an automatic . Drop the guns or get stitched . Do it . You marauders ? Why are you here ? - Marauders ? - Uh , GRs ? GRs ? No , we 're not GRs . I 'm Karen Farrell . These are my daughters . My husband needs tetracycline . That 's why we 're here . GRs ? Uh , GRs , Gone Rogue , people who don 't follow the law . Gone Rogue ? Oh , I get it now . That 's clever . [ laughs ] I 'm sorry you had to witness that . But after what happened , I shoot on sight now . It 's an open carry state , thank God . Glad I hesitated on you . Me too . Do you live here ? I 've been a caregiver here for ten years . After the earthquakes , there were rumors ... Some final event , a meteor heading straight for town big enough to blow up Idaho or the world , even , so everybody took off . Not me . My patients needed me , so my family and I took refuge here . Nothing hit , but nobody ever came back either . Just those darn marauders . Oh , they raided you . Two weeks ago . They cleaned us out of meds , including tetra . My husband , Eddie , tried to stop them , but ... My daughter and I hid in a closet , but one of those men must have had the plague , because after , she ... Well , she 's gone now . She 's a beautiful young girl , same age as yours . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry I have to ask this , but if your daughter had the plague , do you ? Oh , no , I didn 't get infected . No , see for yourself . Yeah , she 's clear . Yup . - Thank you . - Yup . My husband has the plague . I turned down tetracycline that could have saved his life . If he dies , it 's my fault . Can you help ? I remember his name . His name was Josh Copeland . He was at 142 . 142 . Do you get it ? Those men in the berries , the man that died , his watch ... Man in the berries from this morning . His watch was at 1 : 42 . - Okay . His watch said ... - 1 : 42 . - 1 : 42 . - 1 : 42 . 1 : 42 , just like Seattle . Like Seattle , Matt . - The news footage ? - Seattle ! I haven 't seen it .

Grandpa . Why 'd you turn down the tetra ? It came from my father . He 's a very bad man . He runs poisoned tetra . I was stupid not to take it . You know , I ... I have some tetra . You do ? And I 'd be happy to share , but I want something in return . No , no , it 's nothing bad . I just have wheelchair patients on the top floor , and getting up and down this place is a real drag since the generator went kaput . I just need help getting them down . Sure . Whatever you need . Great . And you 're gonna have to leave your guns downstairs . Strangers with guns really spook the patients . You can grab ' em when you go . For Dad . Sure . All right . This way . If their watches stopped at 1 : 42 , that means they were part of the Seattle disappearance and they ended up here . Yeah . - You think Grandpa ... - No . [ mumbles ] Rona ... dog . - Rona ? - Grandpa 's dog . R-Rona 's eyes . Wait , when Dana got bit by Rona , she said that Rona 's eyes were different colors , like the bodies this morning . Mm-hmm . If Rona made it , you think Grandpa made it . The pocket . Take my pocket . [ grunting ] Okay , there 's four people in the picture . We only found three bodies . - Not four . - The son , the son . - We never found the son . - Not four . You think that if we find the son , we 'll find Grandpa . [ mumbling ] In the morning ...

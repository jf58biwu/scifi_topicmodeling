 [ NARRATOR ] Previously on Dark Matter . [ ONE ] We all woke up just like you , no memories , no idea who we are or how we got here . The crew of this ship is supposed to be dead , they 're definitely not supposed to be diseased cannibal monsters . [ SIX ] That 's a nasty gash . [ SIX ] She has all our memories in her head ! [ TWO ] She 's been having dreams ... Dreams she thinks might be memories except that they 're not just hers . Alpha-numeric lock code . Which none of us can remember . You ever dream about the code , kid ? [ FIVE ] No . Yeah , but it 's still rattling around in your head , isn 't it ? [ MAN ] The Emperor is dead ! [ WOMAN ] You will pay for this . [ MAN ] Find the prince ! Arrest him ! Hiding in the shadows like a rat . Take him ! [ GUARDS grunt ] [ TWO ] Something 's not right , it 's happening again . - - [ beeping ] - - [ TWO ] Heart rate 's spiking . Brain wave activity is off the charts . She 's in trouble . [ TWO ] There was a bit of a problem with the job . What kind of a problem ? The ship was destroyed . Are you kidding me ? ! W-What , is this some kind of a sick joke ? ! To be more precise , we blew it up . You blew it up ? ! You blew the ship up ? ! That 's right . I imagine your client 's going to be angry . Oh , yeah , I think , maybe j-just a little . [ TWO ] Angry enough to string you up , cut your heart out and show it to you while it 's still beating ? Because that 's what I 'm gonna do . Whoa . Okay , that 's a whole lot of hostility coming out of nowhere . Given , you know , that I 'm the aggrieved party here . You lied to us . No , I never lied . You didn 't think it was worth mentioning that the Far Horizon was a plague ship ? That this was all about some failed attempts to create an immortality drug ? Okay , first of all , neglecting to mention certain details is not the same as lying . Just wanna point that out . And-And secondly , if I 'd told you about the virus , you wouldn 't have taken the job . So ... sue me . [ TWO ] I 'm not buying it . [ ONE ] What do you mean ? If he really wanted us to get the ship , he would 've warned us about the virus , so we could 've at least gone in prepared . You 're saying he wanted us to fail ? [ TWO ] Pfft . Ferrous wants our heads , right ? Maybe they offered him something to take us out . [ FOUR ] Perhaps , he thought he could win either way . If we succeed , he gets the salvage . If we 're killed , Ferrous pays him off . You know what the real problem is ? Even if all this is true , he 's still the closest thing we have to a friend . What 's our supply situation ? [ TWO ] Bad , bordering on desperate . We 've got enough fuel to reach the outer colonies . There 's not much law out there , so we 'd probably be safe . But ... we don 't have enough food . We 'd have to go back in the stasis pods to even make it that far . After what happened last time , not a chance . [ FOUR ] And what would we do when we get there ? Find some work , if we 're lucky . If not sell the ship . Which is what I have been saying from the start , thank you very much . You said you 'd never do that . Believe me , I don 't want to but I 'm starting to think that we may not have a choice . So , what 's up ? Well , technically this is none of my business , although we are a small group of people forced to live in close quarters , so really it 's everyone 's business , but- - What are you talking about ? When Three and I were on the freighter , it was , kind of ... a life-or-death situation , and sometimes in those moments people say things , and they 're not necessarily- - You 're talking about the fact that Three and I slept together . Okay , so what 's the problem ? Obviously , you 're both adults , and you can do whatever you want , I - | just- - [ sighs ] I-I found it a little surprising . Look , not that I have to explain myself to you , or- - No , hey- - [ TWO ] Hey , shut up . Shut up . [ TWO ] I 'm not even exactly sure why I did it . I was restless and feeling lonely and he was just there . Okay . Sure . That 's it ? The thing is , with a guy like that , you know there are never going to be any complications . Right now , I don 't have room for complications . So you 're ... saying with someone else there might be- - Complications . - - [ ONE ] Exactly . - -Yes . Okay . All right . - -Hey . - -Hey . You busy ? I 'm just going over some fuel consumption numbers . But , uh ... it can-it can wait . Come in . You really think there might be treasure in that vault ? Well , until we can figure out a way to get in , there 's no way to know for sure . What if there is a way ? What are you talking about ? [ FIVE ] Well , I 've been checking out some of the equipment in the infirmary , you know how I like to fiddle . Anyway , with the Android 's help , I think I might be able to adapt some of the medical equipment to work as a kind of mind probe . And who 's mind would we be probing ? Mine . I 've got all your memories in my head , I know it . But they 're jumbled up and they don 't make any sense . - -So , If I could just find- - - - [ FIVE ] No , listen , this sounds way too dangerous . We 'll find another way to get into the vault . It 's not just about the money . You said you wanted to change . Become better than what you were before . But how can you take a different path if you don 't even know how you got there in the first place . If you don 't remember , you 're just gonna end up making the same mistakes all over again . I don 't want to watch that happen . Are we sure this is right ? If she wants to volunteer , let her volunteer . Oh , so now you wanna treat her like an adult ? Hey , I 'm not the one who gave her a vote in how things go around here . Can 't have it both ways . So how 's this gonna work ? She 'll experience the hidden memories like a dream . Like she 's a passenger inside someone else 's body . All she has to do is observe , and remember as much as possible . Will it hurt ? It shouldn 't . But I feel it necessary to point out that the equipment is not designed to be used this way . I know , I know . We 'll be monitoring your vital signs . If anything goes wrong , we 'll pull you out . I 'm ready . [ KENDO INSTRUCTOR ] You must remember to always ground yourself . Understand ? Good , that 's it . Again . [ BOTH grunt ] Stop . Not like this . Like this . [ STUDENT ] Yes , sir . [ KENDO INSTRUCTOR ] Always watch your opponent . Do not look at his eyes but look at his feet , his hips . It will tell you where he 's moving . Understand ? Hm ? Again . [ BOTH grunt ] [ EMPEROR ] Ryo ! Why did you hesitate ? I won the point . There was no need to strike . What is it you think you 're learning here ? Swordsmanship , Father . No . You 're learning discipline . [ EMPEROR grunts ] [ FIVE grunts ] You 're learning to respect our ways and traditions . [ FIVE grunts ] [ EMPEROR ] When you are Emperor , and your enemies find you vulnerable , do you think they will hesitate ? [ BOTH grunt ] [ BOTH grunting ] [ FIVE whimpers ] - - [ computer beeping ] - - [ TWO ] Something 's not right . Brain-wave activity is all over the place . Pull her out . [ FIVE gasps ] Wh-What happened ? [ TWO ] We shut it down . Why ? Because I don 't want you to have a stroke , that 's why . Hey , this was a bad idea . [ FOUR grunting ] It was one of your memories . That 's what I was experiencing when they pulled me out , I 'm sure of it . You were younger , maybe 12 or 13 . You were sparring with another boy . You went easy on him , and your father ... Well , he wasn 't very happy . I see . Sorry , I wish I could 've seen more , something useful . [ FOUR ] You need to learn control . I-I don 't know how , the memories , they 're just random . No , you need to learn to control yourself . Look , you 're a smart girl , but you have an undisciplined mind . You need to learn to observe without emotion . That 's not so easy . Some of the memories they 're pretty intense . Yeah , but they 're nothing but recordings of past events . They can 't be changed , so an emotional reaction serves no purpose . [ FIVE ] Two , this is Five . Go ahead . I wanna try again . Please . Are you sure about this ? I can handle it this time , now that I know what to expect . [ TWO ] Okay ... [ TWO ] Good luck . [ FIVE ] Brother , what is this ? Where are they taking your things ? Where do you think ? The ship leaves tonight . What ship ? You remember when you made this for me ? That time we went to the beach ? I couldn 't have been more than 6 or 7 years old . I remember . It 's funny to think that I kept it all these years . I don 't understand . I do . It makes perfect sense . Father 's getting old , and it 's dangerous to have more than one heir to the throne living in the palace . It gives people ideas . What did he do ? [ EMPEROR 'S WIFE ] Don 't play innocent . It 's bad enough you 've had my son banished off world . Don 't make it worse by insulting his intelligence . I-I 've had him banished ? Your seal was on the Royal proclamation . This was Father 's doing . He wants people to fear me . He thinks it 's the only way I can rule . You have used that excuse for every cruelty you 've visited on your brother for the last 10 years . Maybe you have yourself convinced , but the rest of us know better . Brother . Please . Goodbye . My Lord , I 've been looking for you . Out of my way , Akita-san . I need to speak to our glorious Emperor . Maybe you should wait until you 're in a better frame of mind . You dare disobey me ? I 'm not your student anymore . And I 'm not afraid of him . As you wish , Denka . In bed already , Father ? Having another one of your spells ? Why don 't you just get it over with ... die already ? I know what you did . Wasn 't enough just to be cruel , you had to do it in my name . [ FIVE ] You want me to be an Emperor like you . But I will never be like you . Do you hear me ? [ FIVE gasps ] [ EMPEROR 'S WIFE ] Well , well , what do we have here ? You 're going to pay for this . You did this ! [ EMPEROR 'S WIFE ] I am the Emperor 's beloved wife and you are his cruel , vindictive son who unjustly banished his own half-brother , and who 's been seen staggering about the palace drunk , cursing the Emperor 's name . Who do you think they 're going to believe ? My son will be Emperor , and you will be dead . [ AKITA ] The emperor is dead ! Find the prince ! Arrest him ! Hiding in the shadows like a rat . Take him ! [ grunting ] - - [ FIVE whimpers ] - -lt 's happening again . Heart rate 's spiking . Brainwave activity is off the charts . She 's in trouble . Shut it down , pull her out . Understood . [ FIVE whimpers ] Five , wake up . Five ! Wake up ! Five , can you hear me ? What 's happening ? [ THE ANDROID ] Evidently , the dream state persists , even without the aid of a mind probe . Five , can you hear me ? Five ! [ FIVE panting and whimpering ] What about a shot of adrenaline ? That should wake her up . It could , but with her brain activity already elevated , it could make matters worse . This is not ordinary REM sleep . For all intents and purposes , her brain is functioning on a conscious level , but the dream elements have replaced normal sensory input . But she knows she 's dreaming , right ? She should have full memory of everything that happened before she went in . Her readings are stabilizing . She 's calmed down . Maybe she 's learned to control it , like she said she would . - - [ MAN grunts ] - - [ FIVE ] Sorry . [ beep ] [ FIVE ] Guys , guess who just scored . Dinner 's on me tonight . [ FIVE ] What the hell ? [ BOY ] Das . T.J. ? What 's going on ? Are you all right ? I 've been shot . Oh my god ! [ T.J. ] It 's okay . I don 't ... I don 't think it hit anything vital . Just ... have to keep pressure on it to stop the bleeding . We have to get you to a doctor . No . No , no doctors . They 'd ... They 'd find us . Who ? What is this ? Remember that guy you picked yesterday ? Wh- - Th-The guy with the beard ? [ T.J. ] Yeah , well , that was no ordinary mark . He was- - He was connected . We didn 't have anything , just ... what looked like some weird data storage device . I couldn 't even read it . I need some water or something . [ FIVE ] U-Umm . Here ... It wasn 't a data storage device , it was ... It was some kind of key . [ FIVE ] You mean this thing ? I was gonna see if I could sell it in the market for a few bars . I think it 's worth a lot more than that . They want it back pretty bad . Who 's " they " ? Some guys came around , asking questions . Someone must 've tipped them off 'cause we didn 't even see them coming . T.J ... Where are the others ... ? They 're dead . [ T.J. ] They killed them . [ gasps ] [ FIVE sobs ] We have to get out of here . We have to get on a ship . We don 't have any money . It 's not enough . It 's enough for one . You could get as far as Acamar . No , I 'm not leaving you ! I was in a coffee shop this morning , casing another mark , I-I overheard two guys talking . So ? We need to get to Cargo Bay 4 , now . It 's our only chance . [ MARCUS ] Please tell me this is the last one . [ JACE ] It 's the last one . [ MARCUS ] You 're not just saying that , are ya ? All right , we are outta here . T.J. ? Where are you ? [ banging ] [ T.J. ] I 'm stuck . [ FIVE ] Hold on . We need to find a good place to hide . They 're gonna notice if I bleed all over the freeze-dried food . I 've got an idea . [ FIVE ] Are you O ? [ FIVE ] This isn 't looking so good . I 'll be fine . Look , I heard the engines kick in a few minutes ago . We 're probably already in FTL . So ? I-I 'll go find the crew , and I 'll come clean . I 'll tell them we 're here , and ... ask for their help . Are you crazy ? [ FIVE ] They 're already under way . They 've probably got a schedule to keep . They 're not gonna turn around , go back just for a couple of stowaways . Why would they , when they could shove us out an airlock ? Do you really think they 'd do that ? You wanna take a chance they won 't ? All right , you win . Where you going ? There 's gotta be a sick bay on this tub somewhere . I 'll sneak out , see if I can find some supplies , so we can sew you up good . Then we wait it out . Okay . Be careful . We 're gonna be fine . So , who the hell is Ms. Maplethorpe , anyway ? Uhh , she was a teacher I had when I was a kid . It 's as good a code as any . I know I 'll never forget it . She used to hit me on the knuckles with a ruler . [ TWO ] What is it ? [ THE ANDROID ] We have a problem . What ? Her autonomic functions are receiving diminished input from her hypothalamus . What the hell does that mean ? Her organs are shutting down . [ THE ANDROID ] If we don 't find a way to pull her out she won 't make it . [ THE ANDROID ] Her mind is still functioning , but it 's receiving and processing only imaginary inputs from the dream scenarios . Her brain is losing contact with her body . And without the brain , the body dies . [ THE ANDROID ] Precisely . We could put her in stasis , that would keep her alive . I don 't think that 's a good idea . She 's lost in the memories . She 's gone too deep , am I right ? It 's possible . [ FOUR ] Then the longer she stays in there , the worse it gets . We have to get her out now , or we never will . How ? Someone has to go in there and get her . Is that even possible ? Effectively , yes . [ ONE , TWO ] I 'll do it . No . I 'll go . And I 'm not arguing . [ MARCUS ] Well , well , well . What do we have here ? Looks like a stowaway , maybe a thief ? Junkie ? I 'm not a junkie . Then why the meds , hmm ? What 's the matter , can 't talk ? Ah , don 't worry about it , there 's no sound where you 're going anyway . [ FIVE grunts ] You can 't do this ! Sure I can . Barely even breaking a sweat here . 'Kay , well , what about the rest of your crew ? ! What about them ? Maybe they 'd object to throwing a girl out the airlock ! [ MARCUS ] You don 't know the rest of my crew . [ door beeps ] Wait ! Wait , I have something . Something valuable . Really ? It 's a key . I-I 'm not exactly sure what for , but ... the guy I stole it from killed all my friends trying to get it back . So it must be worth something , right ? It 's hidden somewhere on this ship . You 'll never find it without my help . [ MARCUS ] Hmm . I can live with that . [ FIVE ] Please , no , no ! No , please ! Please ! No ! [ FIVE ] Don 't do this ! Because you 'll experience the memories through her perception , they won 't seem like your own , the way they do for her . You 'll feel more like an outside observer . For that reason , I don 't think there 's any chance of you losing yourself , the way she did . [ SIX ] That 's good to know . Of course , it 's just a theory . Thanks . How will he find her ? She 's got a lifetime of memories crammed inside that head . That 's a lot of ground to cover . I can do my best to sync your brain pattern to hers . That should get you close . But you 'll still have to will yourself in and out of every memory you encounter until you find her . Sounds like a piece of cake . [ TWO ] You can do this . You 'll find her , and you 'll bring her back . I know it . Okay . Fire it up . - - [ laughter ] - - [ SIX groans ] [ GRIFFIN ] Whoo , the look on that guy 's face . [ GRIFFIN laughs ] I still can 't believe we got away with it . Yeah , there 's only one possible explanation , we 're the best ! [ ALL laugh ] Well , I 'll be damned . It 's one of mine . [ laughing continues ] [ GRIFFIN ] There she is . Take a look , boys . We arrived at the station in a shuttle , we left in that . Now that 's what I call trading up ! [ laughs ] No one 's ever stolen a Galactic Authority destroyer before . This is gonna change everything . You 're damn right . Now let 's go get a drink ! [ ALL laugh ] [ laughter ] Brothers , welcome back ! The General himself wanted to be here to congratulate you , but he had to return to Arrakis Sadr to coordinate our next campaign . A toast . To the Insurrection . [ ALL ] The Insurrection ! Has word got out , do people know what we did ? You kidding ? G.A. ' s won 't let this get out , it 's too embarrassing . Any news station tries to broadcast this , they 'll get shut down before they can finish the report . No , this is way too big . There 's no way they can keep this quiet . People everywhere are gonna hear about this , and you know what ? They 're gonna be inspired . They 're gonna to realize that the Galactic Authority isn 't invincible . They 're gonna open their eyes to the corruption of the corporate system , and they 're gonna start fighting back . This is just the beginning . Well said , Brother . [ cups clink ] [ MAN ] You bastard ! How could you do this ? ! Caleb , what 's wrong ? [ MAN ] Why didn 't you tell us ? [ GRIFFIN ] What 's he talking about ? See for yourself . It 's all over the net . [ NEWS ANCHOR ] In a stunning escalation of their terror campaign , members of the so-called Procyon Insurrection have attacked and destroyed a space station in the Hyadum sector . The exact death toll is as yet unknown , but it 's estimated as many as ten thousand people were onboard when the station was bombed . The perpetrators are believed to have escaped on a stolen Galactic Authority destroyer . What ? This is-This is a mistake ! [ NEWS ANCHOR ] Commander Tarvas of the Galactic Authority issued this statement earlier today . [ TARVAS ] These so-called rebels have once again shown themselves to be nothing more than depraved thugs , with no respect for law , order , or human decency . And I promise everyone here today , and everyone watching in the far-flung corners of the galaxy , they will be brought to justice . I-I don 't understand . We didn 't attack that station , there was no bomb . The shuttle you left in the hangar bay was rigged to blow the minute you jumped to FTL in the destroyer . [ GRIFFIN ] What ? ! W-W-Why-Why would you do that ? ! W-We got the ship , we got away , th-that was the mission ! [ LEADER ] The mission was to make a statement . The mission was to serve notice and that 's exactly what we did . The General would never have agreed to this ! [ LEADER ] Who do you think came up with the plan in the first place ? We just ... murdered 10,000 innocent civilians . Those people sold themselves and their families to the corporations a long time ago . No one who participates in that corrupt and decadent lifestyle can claim innocence . [ GRIFFIN retches ] [ LEADER ] Thought you were made of stronger stuff than that . Man up ! This isn 't right ... It has to be a mistake ... It has to be ... [ gun clicks ] Rrgh ! Enough . That 's enough . I 'm back ! [ WOMAN ] Hey , hi . [ WOMAN ] You 're just in time , I was about to go make some soup . [ FIVE ] That sounds great . Jonesy 's still a little lame in her left foreleg . [ WOMAN ] Okay , well , your father will be home tomorrow and he can take a look at it . And it 's his birthday coming up , so should we make him something special ? Elderberry pie ? [ WOMAN ] I thought elderberry pie was your favorite , not his . Are you sure about that ? [ WOMAN ] Okay , elderberry pie it is . Mwah ! I 'll see you in the kitchen when you 're done , okay ? Okay . What are you doing here ? [ SIX ] You can see me ? Of course I can see you . And I know you 're not supposed to be here . Whose memory is this , anyway ? Well , they call me " Titch " for what that 's worth , but I 'm pretty sure it 's One 's . I see a boy 's face in the mirror every morning . It doesn 't look all that much like him but the only other possibility is Three , and ... I kinda doubt he grew up in a place like this . Yeah , I know what you mean . It 's nice . It 's better than nice . He 's got two parents who love him , they 've got a farm , animals , food on the table ... It 's perfect . How long have you been here ? [ FIVE ] I 've lost track . I-lt was summer when I came , it 's winter now . Every day , I go skating on the pond . You 've been on the table less than two hours . Well , I guess time works a little different here . You know it 's not real , right ? We thought we 'd lost you ... Thought you 'd forgotten these were only memories . Sometimes I do forget . You have to come back with me . Your body is dying . Your mind 's gone , and without it- - Just put me in stasis , I-I 'll be fine . Why , so you can stay here ? It 's not even your memory . I saw some of my own memories . No thanks . Yeah , well , that much I can understand . Then let me stay . Look , I admit , out there in the real world we 've got our problems . Maybe that 's an understatement . But in here , you 've got no control . You 're just along for the ride . That 's exactly what I like about it . I don 't have to think , I don 't have to worry . [ SIX ] But it can 't last . Because as nice as all this is , there 's a storm cloud coming and you know it . Whoever grew up here didn 't wind up on that ship without something happening to them , something bad . [ SIX ] Maybe the dad comes home drunk one day and murders the mom . Maybe terrorists show up and set off a bomb . Wh-Who knows ? But it happened to me , and it happened to you and it 'll happen to him . Maybe it all ends badly out there in the real world , too . But , then again , maybe not . In here we can 't change anything , out there , we can at least try . He 's back ! Where is she , did you find her ? [ FIVE gasps ] We thought we 'd lost you there . How are you feeling ? Okay . I guess ? Do you know where you are ? Back on the ship . Guess there 's no place like home . [ FOUR grunts ] I saw some more of your memories . I know what happened to you , I know where you 're from . I already know . [ FIVE ] You do ? I found a royal signet ring among my things . I did some research . Turns out , I was a Prince . Heir to the throne of lshida , until I murdered my own father . No ! No you didn 't . You didn 't kill him . What 're you talking about ? [ FIVE ] I was there , I saw it . You found his body , but he was already dead . It was the Empress . She wanted her own son to rule , your half-brother . The Empress ... I saw some of what you had to do to get out of there alive and it wasn 't pretty . Who knows what you had to do to survive after that , but the point is , it wasn 't your fault . And now that you know , you can put it behind you , right ? You don 't have to be that person anymore . [ FIVE ] Right ? [ knocks ] Come in . I wanted to thank you for coming to get me . You 're welcome . You should know One and Two also volunteered . Not Three ? [ SIX chuckles ] You know , it 's one of the reasons why I didn 't want to come back . I never felt like I knew who to trust out here . I mean , I thought I could trust Two , but ... sometimes she scares rne a little . Yeah , join the club . [ chuckles ] But now , at least , I know I can trust you . - -Goodnight . - -Goodnight .

 Jones-Okeyale ? Okeyale-Jones . Are you kidding me ? West-Kardashian . I rest my case . God , yes , another 11 ! Harry , come on , join me . I thought you were going to show me something I don 't know how to do . - Ugh . - I 've seen that movie . Luck isn 't just about winning , you know . Oh , really ? Bore me with what it is about . Fortune 's a river . You don 't try to control it , you just allow yourself to be swept along . Until you understand that , you 'll never be able to control the bracelet and that 's when bad things happen , Harry . What 's the point of having it if I can 't control it ? I can 't use it to do good . Suri ? Harry , where are you ? There 's been a serious assault in Vauxhall . I 'm on my way . Harry ! Harry ... Yeah . God , you still stink of alcohol . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Then you won 't need a mint . - Thanks . - Take two . So this is DC Okeyale 's partner ? - His fiance . - Alright . Whatever you need , just ask . So what 's so special about this chap that they got me out of bed ? Heir to the Empire ? He 's the fiance of one of the officers from our station . Oh , sorry . How 's she taking it ? Uh , time is a factor here , Ralph . Right , of course . Single blow to the head . Uh , the attacker was strong , potentially right-handed , tall , probably male . We couldn 't get any prints off the handle , but it 's been used . There 'll be DNA . What 's that on the shoulder ? Is that a bruise ? Could he have fought back ? I don 't think it 's a bruise . It 's a tattoo . It 's been removed ... badly . Wham ! No , I don 't think he had time to struggle and get a bruise . Is it consistent with a hate crime ? Yes , but I thought you said he was ... Oh . Ah , right . What about me , then , Suri ? Collect CCTV in here and from traffic . Log every face and every car . Come on ! Are you enjoying this ? Punishing me ? You don 't get it , do you ? This isn 't about punishment . You need to prove to us you can be trusted . Now get the CCTV . Jesus will forgive you ! Listen , Ade , why do you think Kevin left the club alone ? I 've asked myself that 1000 times . Sorry to do this , but ... Do you think he could have been ... - Meeting someone ? - Yeah . Guv , he wasn 't that guy . He wasn 't . - Had he fallen out with anyone ? - No . There was that stabbing last month in Soho . They never caught them . And that acid attack around here . Guv , this is a straight-up hate crime . I could put a list together of the usual scum myself . No , we 're prelimming already . Ade , we 'll look into everything . Stay here . - Our friend is dead ! - The wages of sin are death ! Bitch , I 've had just about enough that I can take all of you ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hey , hey ! Honour your friend peacefully . OK , if I just say , move away . As Reverend Huxley says , as they sow , so shall they reap ! Alright . Listen , love , one more word out of you , I 'll nick you myself , all right ? Why are you protecting these filthy sodomites ? Right , mate , that 's it . Come on , you go in the tank . Oi . Oi . Bring him as well . Him ! Jesus . Who have you arrested , the Salvation Army ? You don 't want to know . What you got ? Sean Blake , caught loitering outside Vauxhall Station on CCTV . Previous for hate crime . He 's done time for trying to glass a copper at a Britain First rally . We actually arrested him eight months ago for assaulting a rival drug dealer in the area , but he got off in court . Bring him in . Sure thing . Couldn 't you just text like everyone else ? Stay away from Harry Clayton . I mean it . Using the bracelet has consequences . You should know that . I know all about consequences . You were happy enough for Harry to use the bracelet when it suited your purposes , weren 't you ? I 'm not the one lying to Harry . All you 've done is lie , Eve . To me . To Harry . Does he know you put this on my wrist ? He doesn 't , does he ? Shall we go tell him ? Shall we ? Don 't . Does he know the pain you 've caused ? The deaths on your hands ? I warned you , and you wouldn 't listen . You destroyed my life . I won 't let you destroy his . Leave us alone . Would you mind telling me what you were doing between the hours of 1 and 3am the night before last ? I was ministering to lost souls . We need you to be a bit more specific . I was giving soup and sandwiches to the homeless at Vauxhall Station . And can anyone vouch for that ? A man whose word is beyond doubt . Reverend Huxley . Huxley ? That 's the second time I 've heard that name today . The Reverend led me out of a life of violence and drugs . Is flower arranging your thing ? You don 't mock a holy man . Verily , I say unto thee . The Reverend has a vision ... redemption for this city . A new dawn . You know who I blame for the collapse of family values ? Not the homosexuals or the bleeding-heart liberals who pander to them . I blame the Christians . Yes , us . I blame us . We have apologised for what is written in the Bible and the book could not be more clear . Man shall not lie with man . It is abomination . Say it . It is ... Abomination ! Those who rebel against the true path will be annihilated - at the day of judgment , for they are ... - Abomination ! These are our streets , and we 're taking them back ! He 's got his own army . Sean Blake , a man with a history of violence , claims to have been with you and members of your ... church between 1am and 3am two nights ago . Is that true ? Well , Detective Inspector , I am proud to vouch for Sean . Sean has put violence behind him . We 've all turned our backs on sin . The tragedy is that young man did not do the same . The tragedy is that he was the victim of a hate crime . Every weekend , young men are pulled out of those clubs on stretchers , veins full of street drugs , hearts full of despair . What are you doing about that ? We 're here to lead the lost out of the wilderness . And if you don 't mind me saying so , Detective Inspector Harry , you look like one of the lost with your tired eyes and that haunted expression . How are you filling the God-shaped hole in your soul ? Drink ? Women ? Gambling ? Ah ! So , you spent your nights at the tables . That 's the devil 's pact you 've made to give you succour . If we find evidence that incriminates Sean Blake in Kevin Jones ' death , it will implicate you in murder . Ooh ! I can see I 've touched a nerve . You won 't find a solution to your self-loathing in the roll of a dice , Harry . Only God can bring sunlight into your soul . Men like him are the reason I left home . God , I 'd love to nail that bastard . We 're here if you need us , Harry . We don 't shoot the wounded . The solution to your pain is not at the roulette table , Inspector Harry . Did you know Kevin Jones ? The dead man ? No . He had a tattoo of that cross on his arm . Shame he didn 't live by it . He might not be dead now . - Sex Discrimination Act ? - 1975 . And then what were the implications for working women ? I don 't have to know what it did , I just have to know when it was . I despair of that school . - Bye . - Go and teach these people something . Where has she gone ? She was right here . You 've been following me for the last 20 minutes . Who are you ? - You blinded me ! - Right , I 'm calling the police . - We are the police . - What ? How long is he going to be ? Someone 's on their way , Mrs. Clayton . - You looking for Harry ? - Yes . I wanted to ask him why I 've been put under police protection . It 's all right , I 'll take her down . Thanks . Just tell me , is it Golding ? We 've had an unconfirmed sighting of him in London . Right . Harry asked us to put a watch on you and Daisy until we knew either way . - And do you ? - We 're still investigating . It 's probably not him . Harry just didn 't want us scare you . Well , it 'd be hard to scare the woman that got the better of two undercover police officers and put one in AE . Very impressive . - You 're the talk of the station . - Yes , aren 't I a genius ? You should have told me . I thought you 'd been through enough . OK ? Of course . Anna , I was wondering if I could have a word . Gala at the reform club is next week and I wondered ... If I 'm out of line , then I apologise , but I wondered if you might like to go together . As a date . Excuse me . Or not . What ? No ... Oh , come on ! Oh , bad luck . It 's getting late . I should go . We have just arrived . I have a murderer to catch . It 's Huxley . Let someone else do it . They don 't know what I 'd do . He says he can see into my soul . Well , I 've seen into his . It 's rotten . What does he claim to see in yours ? I have to go . So you solve this case , then another one , then another one and another one , and then what ? The world is full of bad people . Are you going to spend your whole life chasing them all ? It 's what I do . Work is dull . People are dull . You and I are different . We can step out into this night and anything can happen , and always in our favour . This thing 's not a toy to be played with . No-one 's luck lasts forever . So speaks the gambler who loves to lose as much as he loves to win . - I 'm not that person anymore . - No , exactly , you 're not . Pain , trouble disaster , injury ... they have no dominion over us . Ours is a life of continual good fortune . You can 't know that . Not for sure . Oh . Jesus , Harry . How much proof do you need ? Isabella ? Forget racetracks , casinos ... Isabella , get down . - We can win at life ... - Please . ... over and over and over again . Get down from there . - You 've had your share of bad luck . - Stop it . - And so have I. - Isabella . Now nothing need go wrong for either of us ever again . Come away from the edge , please . Come get me . Isabella ? Don 't you get it , Harry ? We 're invincible . Whoo ! You really think this preacher could have something to do with Kevin Jones ' murder ? Well , he 's lying about not knowing him , I 'm certain . Yeah , but that doesn 't make him a murderer . You said he 's got an alibi . Well , he could have organised it and provided an alibi for the killer . So , what , one of his congregation ? You haven 't seen his congregation . It 's not as implausible as it sounds , sir . His sermon was straight out of the Old Testament ... man shall not lie with man , abomination , hellfire . I hate that shit . What do you know about this Huxley guy ? Where 's he from ? He set up the church five years ago , split from the evangelical movement for being too radical . Before that , he was a psychiatrist . Taught at several London hospitals . He was struck off . Really ? Why ? There was a nondisclosure agreement . I don 't know if it was to protect him or the hospital . Well , I 'd like to know what he 's hiding . What 's that got to do with the murder ? No , leave that for now . Just come back with something more concrete . Steve ? We need to get a copy of Huxley 's disciplinary hearing . You mean the one our boss specifically told us to leave ? - Exactly . You 're getting better . - Yeah . - All the best . Night , Glenda . - Bye , Rev. Powerful message , Reverend . - Ah ... Safe home . Thanks for coming . - Thank you so much . How is this a hate crime ? Well , is it the same killer ? It 's too early to tell . The murder weapon 's from the same brand . Huxley has an alibi . You need to open out the investigation , Harry . I don 't think I 've got the wrong guy . If the victims are unconnected , we could have a serial killer on our hands . They are connected . Kevin Jones had a tattoo of that cross on his arm . I think Huxley lied when he said he didn 't know him . Huxley 's involved . I can feel it . You and I both know that half of all policing is instinct . You get a feel for a case . Instinct won 't bring Ade justice . Open up the investigation . Follow the evidence . You 're letting prejudice cloud your judgment . Talk to the husband , Harry . We argued . Last thing I did was shout at her . Why ? I was sick of her spending all her time with her ... church . There are worse places to spend your time . Huxley had some kind of hold over her . She thought he was God or something . And I didn 't like the people that went there . Attracted all sorts . Do you have any objection to us taking a sample of your DNA so we can rule you out of our enquiries ? No , of course not . And we need to ask you where you were this evening . At home with the kids . Oh , God . What am I going to say to them ? And if you don 't mind me saying so , Detective Inspector Harry , you look like one of the lost , with your tired eyes and that haunted expression . How are you filling the God-shaped hole in your soul ? Gambling ? I thought it was Huxley , too . Are you sure it 's not ? It might not be a hate crime , but he knew both victims . We don 't know that for sure . And why kill Melanie ? She was his biggest fan . Maybe she caught him with his hand in the collection tin ? Maybe they were having an affair ? That 's weak , Harry . You 've got nothing . You 're letting Huxley get under your skin . Suri ? You 're meant to be at Melanie Spencer 's postmortem . Winter 's here . Oh , bollocks ! Why 's Winter here ? - I lied . I thought it might hurry you up . - What ? We 're three days into a double murder , and we don 't have any leads . We 've Huxley . Like I said , we don 't have any leads . You don 't need me to tell you this was a frenzied attack . - Multiple blunt force head injuries . - Mm-hm . But no defensive injuries in either case which sometimes indicates that the victim was known to the killer . You see ? Not expecting an assault from them . So they 're not stranger killings , but we can 't find a connection between them . I think we can . Could you turn her arm round , please ? Ta-da ! There 's your connection . Huxley . He has an alibi for both killings . Not one I 'd trust . 1-8-2-2 . What 's that ? What ? There 's numbers around the tattoo . Can you bring up Kevin 's ? Yeah . See ? Same numbers on Kevin 's . What do they mean ? - I 've no idea . - Well , it proves Huxley was lying . No , it 's just proves Kevin was connected to the church . Huxley is the church . He said he 'd never met Kevin . - OK . - OK . Ade , Kevin had a tattoo removed . Do you know anything about that ? I knew he had a tattoo removed before we met . He said it was a mistake . There 's some numbers under it . 18-22 . Why would he have Leviticus on his arm ? Leviticus ? Erm ... Chapter 18 , verse 22 . Err ... Man shall not lie with man . It 's abomination . That 's what Huxley preaches . How do you know that ? When I came out , my parents wouldn 't accept it . They thought I could be cured . It 's what my dad shouted at me when he kicked me out . Huxley was struck off the register of psychiatrists . Gay conversion therapy is against their code of practice . So Kevin joins Huxley 's church , Huxley ... tries to make him straight . We need to find out if that 's the reason he was struck off . Harry , wait . We need a court order to get a copy of Huxley 's disciplinary hearing , and we need Winter 's approval for that . Meh . You can 't get it without Winter 's approval . Yes , I can . What are you going to do ? I 'll think of something . _ _ _ Come on . _ - _ - We have no defence against it . Not any of us . Is there really anyone here who believes themselves a match for Satan and all his words ? Is there anyone here with an ego that big ? Anthony Huxley , I need you to accompany us to the station . And why is that ? It 's not a conversation you want to have in public . I have nothing to hide . Anything you want to ask me , you can do it in front of my congregation . You 'll want a solicitor to be present . I see into you , Harry . I see how scared you are . Scared you can 't stop . Scared your addiction will destroy everything you hold dear . This man ... is destroying his life through gambling . For your information , I don 't gamble . Really ? That 's clearly news to your sergeant . How long has it been since you 've been at the tables , Harry ? How long have you sworn off ? Waking up every day wondering if this is the day your willpower will break and you 'll roll the dice again . Gamble away your family , your career . You know nothing about me . Oh , I know everything about you ... because , you see , Harry , I was you . I do see into you and you are terrified . I 'm not scared of anything . Except the blackness of your own soul . Anthony Huxley , I am arresting you on suspicion of murder ... Harry ... Harry ... ! ... you do not have to say anything , but it may harm your defence if , when questioned , you do not mention something that you later rely on in court . Anything you do say can be used in evidence ... Sit down , Sean , or I 'll put you down . We 'll all pray for you , Harry . Cheers . Where 's Harry ? Sir , I 'm joining him in the interview ... Why 's he arrested Anthony Huxley ? I specifically told him to follow procedure . We found a tangible connection ... Are you going to spend the rest of your life making excuses - for his behaviour ? - I 'm not making excuses for anyone . She 's telling the truth , sir . There 's a link , she explained it to me . Huxley 's been lying to them . Which interview room 's he in ? I have indulged you , Harry , because I feel some sympathy for your gambling problem , but lashing out at me with absurd allegations is not going to help you face your demons . You lied to me about not knowing Kevin Jones . He was a member of your congregation . Kevin had a tattoo on his arm of the cross from your church . Half of London decorate their bodies with the cross . The tragedy is , they don 't take it into their hearts . Melanie Spencer , also a member of your congregation , had the same tattoo . The two things these people had in common are you . And the fact that they were both brutally murdered . That 's why I 've been arrested ? That 's it ? Really ? Please tell me this isn 't all he 's got ? Not quite . " Dr. Huxley has repeatedly breached professional rules of conduct , " pursuing his unethical and damaging conversion therapy with " vulnerable gay clients . No , no , no , no ... that report was confidential . " He is ... " And this is my favourite part , " ... pathological in his hatred of gay men , and is " a danger to vulnerable lesbians and gay men in the community . " I only didn 't tell you that I knew Kevin because I knew you would jump to exactly this conclusion . But you did know him , didn 't you ? You tried to make him straight . At the church , after I 'd stopped practising as a psychiatrist . There is nothing illegal about that . And when he refused your offer of help , you couldn 't let it go , could you ? You pursued him , you murdered him . Harry ... why would I kill Kevin ? I was the same as him . What do you mean ? I was led out of the darkness of homosexuality , and so I lead others into the light . And they , in turn , help others . We are all sinners , Harry . But some of us are willing to face our demons and banish them . Is that all ? Can I go ? We are going to have one mother of a complaint made against us . Kevin tried this therapy with other men ? We keep our recovery from homosexuality by giving that recovery to others . Kevin was my greatest protege . Who did he try to convert ? Members of the church . Lots of people came to us for help . Did he convert Melanie Spencer ? Melanie wasn 't gay . She wore the tattoo to support her husband . Kevin converted Robert Spencer ? Yes . Why ? It 's 1 : 40pm , I am terminating the interview and turning off the tape . Take him back to the cells , he hasn 't killed anyone . Well , that 's what I 've been telling you all along . - And I think I 'm owed an apology . - Apology ? You may not have killed anyone physically , but you sure as hell have got blood on your hands . Y ... I know , I know . Just ... Orwell , bring up the CCTV footage from the club . I 've viewed this footage a dozen times . If there was anything on here , I would have seen it . I kept asking myself , why would Kevin leave the club ? Ade said he wouldn 't leave with someone else , but why abandon your fiancee on your stag night ? Right , here 's Kevin Jones . - No-one follows him out . - No , go back , go back . There . Leaving ahead of him . - Who 's that ? - Melanie Spencer 's husband . - How could you miss that ? - Oh , my God . No , Melanie Spencer was still alive when I viewed this footage , her husband wasn 't in the frame . We were looking for a connection between Kevin and Melanie . Kevin was involved in converting gay men at the church , Melanie 's husband was a member of that church . Robert Spencer is the connection . All right , we 've got officers at all the ports and stations . Spencer 's car will light up the ANPR like a Christmas tree if he even indicates onto an A road . - He 's not going to run . - Why not ? When we first interviewed him , he had no reservation about giving his DNA . No . - So it 's never been about getting away . - So what is it about ? In his mind , he 's putting things right . Then we need more officers on this search . - All right . - Yes . All right , uh ... - Incident room . - Custody suite . - Huxley 's brief is asking for release ? - No . Best keep him under lock and key . Who 's that ? Huxley 's solicitor wants him out . I said no . Not with Spencer on the loose . Steve , bring up the CCTV footage again . I don 't know how I missed that . I checked every feed , I logged every face . Like you said , Spencer wasn 't on the radar when you went through the tapes . No , I should have checked again . After the second death . This is DI Clayton , change of plan . You can release Anthony Huxley . You know , one day , Harry 's luck is going to run out . You 're not careful , he 's going to take you down with him . If you spent more time thinking about your work and less about Harry , you 'd get better results . He sure as hell isn 't thinking about you . Where is he ? Harry ! Harry ! It 's alright , boys . I 'm going to get us out of here . Jesus ! Come on , get your seat belts off ! You can do it , come on ! I 'll take care of Frank ! Go , go ! Go , run ! Go , it will be fine ! Go , Harry ! Go ! This could all be over in a moment . You 'll be at peace . Wouldn 't that be a relief ? You 're right . I deserve to die . It 'll be a relief . I 'll do you first , and then I 'll do me . Oh , no , no , no , no , no , please ! Please , stop ! I 'm begging you , please ! Robert , wait . You come any closer and I 'll slit his throat now . Oh , no , no , no , no , no ... I know what happened , Robert . I know why you killed Kevin . I understand . - You couldn 't understand . - I do . You went to the club , and there he was . On his stag night . Getting married . The life you should have had . - It could 've been me . - I know . Should 've been . God , I loved him . And all those bloody stupid sessions , pretending to change . When all I wanted him to do ... was hold me . He followed you out of the club , didn 't he ? He wanted to talk to you . He said we could start again . Start a new life . Said it wasn 't too late . But he didn 't have a wife and two kids . He hadn 't ruined everything because of him . No , no , no , no , no , no ! Yeah . - Yeah , well , this is where it ends . - No . Please , please , please , please ... No-one else is going to go through what I went through . Do it . What ? Do it . He 's responsible . For Kevin . For Melanie . His hypocrisy . - His lies . - Harry , please ! You 'd be doing the world a favour . Ahh ! He was going to kill me ! Me ! Cut me loose , Harry . Thank God . Cut me loose . Untie me , Harry . Harry ! So , if I were to ask the custody sergeant , " Who released Huxley ? , " would I like the answer ? - We got him , didn 't we ? - Yeah , Robert Spencer , it wasn 't Huxley . - Your instincts were wrong . - I was half right . - Right-ish . - No , you were lucky . I can 't talk now . - Hi . - Hey . Come on , Dais , you 'll miss the start of the film . She can 't go anywhere without eyeliner . She 's really bad at it . Hi , Dad . Oh , my God , Robert Smith in the flesh . Who ? In you get . You sure this is a good idea ? There 's nothing new on Golding . I 'm doing everything I can , I promise . Anyway , I wouldn 't take her out if there was any risk . - You wouldn 't take that gamble , right ? - Of course not . - Not again , anyway . - Oh , Jesus . Sorry , that was low . Go on , have fun . I don 't know what to say . - If I could take it off ... - Don 't . - I keep trying to tell you . - There is no magic . You 're an addict . That 's all there is . Dad . Yeah . - Go on , you 'll miss it . - Anna . Hello . Ah , you sound tired . Yeah , long day . This case , you know ? The awful Huxley . Sometimes , there 's no justice . Fortune favours the bold , Harry . As far as I can tell , it favours bigoted hypocrites . You should learn to trust in the bracelet . Even with the bracelet , I failed to stop him . Why would you say that , Harry ? Luck always finds a way . If that were true , Anthony Huxley wouldn 't be walking around . Oh , Harry , I think you 'd be surprised .

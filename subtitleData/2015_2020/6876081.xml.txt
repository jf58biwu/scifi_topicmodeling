 - Is this the right road ? - I guess . - The guy said it was . - He said there was a turn . There . Left . Any good ? - You do realise how big this story is ? - Standing by . Are you on with Jan ? Let me talk to him . Jan , it 's Terri . Are you going to cut in for us , yes ? Don 't give me that . This is huge . Look , my source is good . It 's happening . Thank you . They are cutting us in . Are you ready ? Beyond the horizon is the world-famous Rezort , where , if our sources are to be believed , there was a serious security breach late last night . As a result , reports are coming through , not yet denied , that a Brimstone protocol has been activated . The second-known use of the Brimstone protocol in the last ten years . That 's right , John . It is only considered if there is a genuine risk of another outbreak . The chromosyn-A outbreak ten years ago was the deadliest pandemic the world has ever known . A virus that kills people and brings them back to life . A virus that creates wars between the living and the dead . The most brutal and vicious war that humanity has ever waged . A virus that annihilates two billion people . Two billion people . The Brimstone protocol was the cure . So , why the need to use it again after seven years of rebuilding free from infection ? The last place on Earth where they can be found , the Rezort is a sun-drenched island where guests can pay to shoot the undead . Vengeance , baby ! Vengeance ! Still no comment from the Rezort 's parent company . No questions ! An outbreak at the Rezort would be utterly catastrophic , wouldn 't it ? If true , yes , but look , what can 't be overstated is the pioneering vision of Rezort CEO Valerie Wilton . Who is Valerie Wilton ? She has been described as many things . She used the undead left roaming her island when the rest had been destroyed to create jobs , to stimulate the economy ... We are now hearing rumours that the army has been called in to evacuate this airport and the refugee camp surrounding it . The camp , which is run by Hope 4 U , is one of dozens set up by the charity around the world to help cope with the humanitarian disaster that the outbreak sparked . And if the protocol fails , what then ? Well , we will do exactly what we did last time . Dropping bombs on hundreds of innocent people ? Young lady , you get gangrene in your foot , you sacrifice your whole leg to save the rest . You lost this argument a long time ago . That 's why the people are behind us because the people understand that a sharp knife cuts quick . The question that remains is , in this age of relative optimism , with humanity almost back on our feet , if an exclusive island paradise with a billion-dollar security can be overrun , then what hope- - There , confirmation , if more were needed , that something has gone very seriously wrong at ... You 're not still hear from the outbreak survivor 's support group thing , are you ? It 's just I 've got to lock up now . Didn 't you see the guy turn off the lights ? No , I didn 't . Thanks , though . You at the Rezort , seriously ? Yeah . Someone shared at the group who 'd been and it really helped them . And for the first time , I am thinking it might be right for me too because ... If I can 't get over this , then ... I am just going to fade away . Alone , because you will have left me for someone who isn 't completely mental . Hey . Won 't happen . I am with you . 100 per cent . You won 't have to anything or go anywhere . It was the war , Mel . It affected us all . Hmm ? - You 'd love something like this . - I 'd fucking smash it ! I 'm sorry . I don 't know how you got through it . I just looked forward . The future . And what 's it like ? Killing them ? Depends . Mostly , it just feels right . Go back to sleep . I 'm OK . Melanie , honey . I know you 're angry with me . Honestly , I never wanted to leave you . If you 're watching this , you 're safe . That 's all that matters to me . You 're such a good person , kind , caring , always have been . I am going to tell you some things and I need you to listen to me , OK ? The world I raised you to live in , it 's gone . When we talked about right and wrong , it doesn 't matter any more . People have changed , and I need you to change too . Fit in or they will pick you out as weak , and I need you to stay strong , I need you to fight , and keep on fighting long after this war is over . I know this is going to be hard for you . But you have to promise me , baby , promise me that you will stay strong . Passports , please . We have a nice lounge area . And the boat to the Rezort is scheduled to start soon , so please relax . Enjoy yourself . You 've got to let me give you something towards this . It 's OK . I can afford it . Kind of . You 're doing this for me anyway . No , you 're right . It is a real chore . Relax . Enjoy yourselves . So , the island was totally overrun ? Oh , yeah , recon unit found it after the war teeming with shufflers . Wilton 's group bid for clean-up relief , built the Rezort instead . Now , that is spotting a market and exploiting it . Zero outlay . Millions in mark-up . I am all about making sure that you are on the ground level for the next Rezort . People be proper old ! Yeah , but ... Fuck me . I would tap that until it fell off . Dude ! Yo , I meant my dick not her arse . Either way , man ! Travelling alone ? Yep , afraid so . Wedding present . Tickets arrived on time . Pity the fiancé didn 't . Non-refundable , so ... Well , you came to exactly the right place to be working out any anger . Oh , yeah , let 's hope that they all look just like him . Hello . I can 't believe it 's still such a problem . Well , at least they are getting some sort of help these days . If you could all follow me , thank you ! We 're up . Welcome to the Rezort . Would you like some champagne ? Yes , yes , yes , go ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Lewis and Melanie ? My name is Isabel . Welcome to the Rezort . How was your flight ? And this is your living room . And the bedroom . - Anything you need , call our concierge . - Thank you . There will be cocktails by our pool for new guests at six . - Very nice . - Is everything satisfactory ? Yes , thank you . Don 't forget . Your orientation starts shortly . Orientation ? Whoa ! Sprayed it like a total newb ! Check it , bruv ! Cease fire ! Weapons down . Whoa ! Safety glasses off , ear defenders off . Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . Please make your way out of the firing range . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the firing range . Please take a booth each . Safety glasses on , ear defenders on . They got nothing like this in Hong Kong . Need some assistance with your weapon , ma 'am ? We 're good , thanks . Do you have weapons experience , sir ? Uh , yes , in the war . OK , well , you 're still here , so that 's good enough for me . You OK ? - Shall we do this together ? - Yeah . Take it by the grip . It 's just about breathing . And concentrating . OK . Breathe in . And out . And squeeze . - And again . - OK . It 's actually pretty cool . Warrior princess . What ? Nothing . You look happy . Maybe I am . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the world-famous Rezort . As our new guests , we 'd like to extend a very personal welcome to you . So , please show your appreciation for the visionary mind behind our island paradise . Valerie Wilton ! Two billion dead . The world in ruin . The chromosyn pandemic gave each of us a story . Those stories led us all to this island . In a world rebuilt , a world reborn I created the Rezort to make your fantasies come true . We are here to offer you a holiday like no other ... A killer . Sand , sun , sea and slaughter ... So , why are you here ? - Vengeance , baby , vengeance ! - To kill those fucks ! Come on ! We know exactly why you are here . Huh ? Feel good ? Now you 're talking my language . Whoa ! Ladies and gentlemen , the undead have had their fun , now it 's your turn . At the Rezort , we firmly believe that every apocalypse deserves an after party . I fucking love this place ! Whoa ! For a quirky , fun time , please enjoy our ... It 's unacceptable . I am not paying those sort of prices . - Try again . - I am not sure this is going to work . - It 's probably nothing . - We don 't know . Maybe we should tell her ... or you should tell her . - She likes you . - You found it . And you would too , hours ago , if you had done your systems , which you never do . OK , OK , let 's just get through today . I 'll clean the system overnight . She 'll never know . OK ? Just keep going through , people . Keep going all the way through , please . Thank you very much . Just keep coming . Straight through . Whoa ! Yeah ! Mikey , who you got today ? A bunch of dick-swinging investment types . Maybe I 'll get lucky and they 'll shoot themselves , huh ? Your pre-selected weapons are waiting for you . Your appointed guide will take you to your vehicles . Whoa ! Easy there , tiny . This is reserved for grown-ups . Reserved for fucktards , more like ! Step this way . 'Sup ? Fuck , yeah . - Archer . - Yeah . Actually , you sit ... Hey , wherever you like . OK , so , my name is Tom Nevins . I 'll be your guide this weekend . We are good to go . So if everyone has visited their respective little girls ' or little boys ' room , let 's go have some fun , yeah ? Right , let 's begin . Ladies and gentlemen , your adventure starts in five ... four .. Three ... Gates opening . Park is live . - It 's all for show . - Oh , it 's fucking on , boy ! All guest vehicles away . Locked and secured . All good . Locked and secure . What 's causing that ? System 's been laggy this morning . I think it 's OK now . I don 't pay you to think , Salva . I pay you to know . Fix it . You 'll have seen fences that divide areas of the park . That 's just to keep them from herding too much . Once we are inside those boundaries , then we are on our own . Awesome ! OK , we really should go over some health and safety . So , rule number one , bites not blood . Remember the time you went to school , yeah ? Chromosyndrome-A is passed through saliva so beware of teeth . - You know rule number two ? - Fresher they are , the faster they are . Yes , but since all of our shufflers date back to the war , that doesn 't really matter out here . - Rule number three- - - Three . If you don 't shoot them in the head , you are pretty much dead . What do you think we are ? Newbs ? On the left , you can see some of our other guests at their shooting spot . Whoa ! Yeah ! Not bad shooting . Don 't want to make you look bad , guys . Let me show you how it 's done . All right , all right . Finger on the trigger . You 're up . Let them have it ! Fucking die ! Yup ... You show ' em , boys ... Hey , man . Yeah . OK , take your time , relax . Just remember everything you were shown on the range . All right , easy , boys . I didn 't realise there would be so many . Yeah , buddy . Enjoy . Rifle , miss ? - Um , no , I am good for now , thanks . - All right . That 's shameful . Allow me , yeah ? What ? You ready ? You go first . Got one ? - Yep . - OK , now remember . Breathe in ... And when you 're ready squeeze and fire . I know you can do it , Mel . Yeah , just ... give me a sec . - Just squeeze the trigger . You can do it . - Yeah . Mel ? She looked at me . - Sorry . - No , no , don 't be sorry . Yo ! All it takes is a little TLC . Gentle touch always does the trick . Is it the same problem as before ? We don 't know yet . This might take a while . What are you doing tonight ? Tate , run full diagnostics . I 'll get on to it right away . This is us , folks . Your room for a night under the stars . Then his head was like , boom ! Seriously , I want to marry this place and have its beautiful babies . I think this is a bad idea . Coming all this way and spending that money . I couldn 't do it . She looked at me . Let 's give it a chance . It 'll be good , I promise . Are you enjoying yourself ? Yep . You didn 't feel like shooting . Well , my fiancé ... well , my ex-fiancé , it was more his kind of thing . It really is beautiful here , though , right ? Sure . Sorry about your fiancé . Yeah , sucks to be him . We won a tournament , me and Alfie . The prize was to come here . We play Genocide . It 's an online shooter . I mean , there 's a campaign , but it sucks , so ... You 've heard of it . No . Huh ? Really ? It 's kind of a big deal . Our team name is Smashed Up . - Boom ! - Wow ... - Great name . - Yeah , I came up with it . - No , you didn 't . - Sorry , how old are you ? 16 . Ha ! That went pretty well ! - What is it ? - I traced the lags . There was an unauthorised access of the system late last night . Why am I just hearing about this now , Salva ? Who was it ? Somebody swiped through reception five minutes before but with no ID attached . - No idea how they did that . - They downloaded a ton of data . - But they left something behind . - Get Security in here right now . - I lost readings everywhere . - Are the fences done ? - I 'll take over . - I don 't know . - Salva ? - The system is not responding . - Not letting me override . - Warn the cars . And that is how we take care of business . I gotta take a piss . Hold it , princess . Excuse me , will you ? It 's no good , it 's jammed . It 's not working . Look . Whoa , he 's angry . Done . - Fuck . - Done ? What do you mean it 's done ? Are we clear ? Fuck ... Me love you long time . The fucking alarm ! Give me options . If it 's a virus skull-fucking the system , then probably trying to reboot itself . We start clean . No . Guys , I pissed all over him . Could you get in the car for me , please ? You were lucky , man . I wasn 't scared at all , not for a minute . Go , go , go ! How much of the Rezort 's breached ? Go ! Teams on every entrance now . - Listen , we have to reboot this now . - It 's not going to work . Keep trying ! This is fucked . I am out of here . Valerie ! Brimstone protocol activated . You 've still got another hour till it 's your turn . Can 't sleep . Really is beautiful here . If you can ignore the slaughter , that is . Hmm . You 're not one of those psych cases sent here by a doctor to ... Oh , I 've read about it . That 's all . Something like that . No one forced me , though . - Chose to be here . - Kill to get well . Sure . Thanks . They are just us , you know ? Still , I hate them . My dad was ... Just like a normal dad , you know ? He was a good man . He was a kind man . I watched him turn . Where do you think it goes ? When they come back ... That goodness in people . What do you think happens to it ? Maybe it doesn 't go anywhere . Or maybe ... I don 't know it lives on in you . Hmm ! Do you know where they word " zombie " comes from ? No . African tribes once called their soul " nzambi " . But when they were transported to Haiti as slaves , their soul became " zombi " . Meaning " all free will gone " . Unthinking , uncaring . Right now , does that sound more like them or us ? Do you ever find yourself thinking that ... we won the war but ... we forgot why ? Every day . We have all these ethics about how we are treated before we are born and after we die , but we get bit , we are just fair game . Literally . Jesus . If we can treat the dead like meat , then who is to say the living won 't be next ? Sadie , where 's your gun ? Help ... Get up ... Get up ! Get up ! - Sadie ! - Jack , wake up ! Sadie , shoot it . Sadie ! Shoot . Sadie , shoot it ! Sadie ! Sadie , shoot it ! - Shoot it , Sadie ! - No . Sadie ! Whoa ! Ha ! Yeah , buddy . Hakuna matata , motherfucker . They shouldn 't get this close . Isn 't this why we take turns to keep guard ? - Do they not roam free in these parts ? - Are you kidding ? There are hidden fences everywhere . How long would we stay in business if guests got bit ? So , what the fuck 's going on ? Ah , shit ! Stay down ! Don 't move ! Look . Go , go , go ! Red , red , red ! Red , red , red ! Brimstone protocol activated . Jack ! Jack ! Magazine . Quick , get up ! OK . We need to get to the truck . Everybody to the truck ! Quick ! Lewis ! Just fucking die ! Alfie ! Hold your fire . Hold your fire . Fuck ! All clear . How is everyone 's ammo ? - Four rounds . - Nothing . I 've still got this . Listen , it won 't be long until they discover something 's wrong and they 'll come for us . - Yeah , we 'll be OK . - They 're not coming . - What ? - The whole park is down . Brimstone ? - How long ? - Just a few hours . - They level the island . - Jesus Christ . It prevents the spread of infection . And we are just collateral damage . What about the rest of the staff ? Uh , we were told to rally at the dock 30 minutes before the strike . Where are you going ? You heard the man . To catch a boat . It 's too far . He 's wasting his time . - There 's no way without a truck . - We just wait around for the inevitable ? OK , look , we didn 't come in a straight line . There must be a quicker way back . Hold on . OK . Uh ... Maybe ... Yeah , right . If we cut across here , that just leaves this fence and town to cross . Then we are at the communications relay . It has underground access back to the dock . If it 's clear , we could make it in time . OK . Still here ? Brimstone protocol activated . You OK ? Yeah . It 's just bringing it all back . Like muscle memory . Look at him . He 's loving it . Hey . It 'll be OK . - I 'm sorry about your friend . - His name was Alfie . Sorry . He was so excited about coming here . He just wanted us to have a ridiculously awesome time , you know ? I was such a dick to him . We didn 't get off to the best start , did we ? I 'm Sadie . You seriously want to do this ? OK . Excuse me . Can I ask you a question ? Who the fuck made you the man ? You . When you decided to follow me . The fence is just up ahead . Fuck ! Thanks , bruv . Jesus , Mike . All of you , move . Now . Nevins . Nevins . Jesus . How did things turn to shit so fast ? The systems in this place , the security , is watertight . This ain 't your fault , bruv . This is some virus thing , swear down . Some next-level hacker shit . How would somebody do that ? I don 't know . From anywhere . Internet , innit ? Inside job would be easier . - Gate safe ? - Yeah , gate 's fine . Go . Go on . One at a time . - Let 's go . Come on . - Archer . - Women and children first , man . - Sure . Go , go . Go , go ! No ... No ... It 's OK . It 's gonna be OK . Fuck me , man . Melanie . Melanie . Hey . Don 't worry about wasting that guy . Seriously , I met him . He was a prick . The world 's a better place . Are we not talking to each other now ? So this was you , was it , during the war ? Don 't worry about it . Happens . That doesn 't make it OK . Listen , I liked Nevins but he was gonna turn . Your boyfriend . He came here for you . And what are you doing here ? The only thing I was ever good at . You act tough . But you had the chance to leave and you came back . You had the map . I think I found it . There it is . No turning back when we get there . And you , keep your head in the game . Or we 're leaving you behind . Fuck off ! You don 't even know her , kid . And what you do ? Fucking apologise . Just leave it , Jack . The other night , sneaking around , avoiding Security . - What does he mean ? - So what ? Last I checked , it was still a free world . You 're gonna tell them , why you 're here ? Hmm ? Sadie ? Look , I just downloaded some files . That 's all . What files ? Whatever we could use to get this place closed down . Who is " we " ? - Living 2 . - The undead-rights activists . What did you do to get in the system ? I just typed some codes that they gave me . And I used this . Look , I don 't even know what 's on it . It 's encrypted . Are you fucking kidding me ? You 've been played . While you were downloading whatever , they uploaded some shit . So all these people are dead because of you ? Oh , come on . Do you honestly think I would be here with you if I knew this was gonna happen ? Jack ! I didn 't know . Yeah , tell it to Alfie , yeah ? I 'm so sorry . Yeah ... Well , we are not gonna leave you behind . Jack . Jack . OK , Jack ... Jack ... OK , come on , quick ... Come on ... Jack , come on ... Wait , wait , wait ! Jack and Sadie . OK ... OK ... OK ... OK ... Come on ... Jack ! Jack ! Fuck ! Jack , come on ! Fuck ! Jack , quick ! Jack , in here ! Oh , fuck ... Jack ! Jack ! Sadie ! Jack ... Jack ... Jack ... I 'm so sorry . Sorry . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Jack , where 's Sadie ? Hey , we need to go . Now . It 's along here somewhere . Fuck . Next ? This way . Wait , we are willingly going into the dark place ? Fuck ! What is it ? Nothing . Keep going . What the hell were they doing in here ? Shit ! Move ! Go ! Go ! Move ! Move ! Fucker ! Move , move , move ! Go on , move ! Go , go , go , fucking move ! Go , go ! Fucking move ! Go ! Whoa ! Whoa ! What is happening here ? Cattle runs ? Ovens ? Seriously , fuck this island . No , no , no ... Jack ... Walk away . Walk away . Hope 4 U. From the airport . It 's a hell of a way to solve the refugee crisis . Who 's to say the living won 't be next ? Something that Sadie said . They are making more to keep the island running . But they 'd all be fresh . The heaters are for ageing them . They could never get away with it . They did . Because nobody cares . Fuck ! Lewis ! Lewis ! Lewis ! You go first . You go first . I 'll hold them back . - No . - Go on , go . I 'll be right behind you . Come on . Go . Go , go , go ! Archer , come on . You got Sadie 's stuff . Just make sure it gets out . No . Archer ! Come relax at our spa with our hot-stone massage ... I 'm sorry . - You left me . - I 'm sorry . When you run , everybody runs . Lewis . No , no , no , I am not one of them . Are you alone ? - Yeah . - Oh , Christ . Come on , the emergency exit is our only option . The problem is getting to it . There is a crawlspace under the terminal . We can get to it through there . They 're holding a study group by the door . They never leave , and we 've got about five minutes until the island is incinerated . We need a distraction . - You 're an animal . - What ? You killed all those people . - The refugees . - Now is not the time to talk about- - You are worse than they are . I 'm a businesswoman in a world with new priorities , and you pay for it . Give me the gun . Do you want to live or not ? Go fuck yourself . It 's been three weeks since the terrible incident which claimed the lives of 250 people . Investigators are still no closer to figuring out what caused made nigh on impossible by the drone strike which levelled the island and incinerated the resort . To date , only one survivor has been named , Melanie Gibbs . But authorities suspect she may not have been the only one to make it off the island alive . Her release of a cache of top-secret files downloaded from the Rezort 's computers before disaster struck continues to make waves . A public enquiry has been announced to investigate the allegations of a link between the Rezort and the Hope 4 U charity , implicating them both in a conspiracy to profiteer from the death of thousands of innocent refugees . On the contrary , we welcome the enquiry and look forward to refuting once and for all these terrible allegations . They are lies . Miss Gibbs hasn 't spoken publicly since handing the files to the media but broke her silence to talk to us about the proposed enquiry . Any investigation is a start . But it won 't fix the problem . What happened at the Rezort , it 's on all of us . Because we won a war but somehow ... we lost ourselves . I went there to try and fix myself and then I realised I am not the one who needed fixing . I know what 's coming next . I think we all do . How you deal with it this time , that 's up to you . Amidst this talk of enquiries , that could drag on for years , let us not forget the immediate plight of the refugees at the Hope 4 U camp near here . They now face the terrible prospect of the charity going bust- - Jesus , what is going on ?

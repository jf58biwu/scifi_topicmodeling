 Previously on " The 100 " ... It 's started . They 're bleeding my friends . I think I know how to take Mount Weather . We just need someone on the inside . Bellamy ? They 're already using their blood , and things are gonna get ugly in here real fast . You 're not taking anyone else out of this room without a fight . No . Hey ! Uh ! Ugh ! Everybody move ! Take the level ! Go ! There 's a war council meeting happening tonight , and all the leaders are going to be there . We 're gonna use a missile . Whitman to Mount Weather command . All targets accounted for . We have to start evacuating . If we evacuate , they 'll know we have a spy inside their walls . We slip away right now . On your command , Sir . Fire . We have to leave now . You knew . Mom ... Please tell me this wasn 't you . I wish I could . No . No . Clarke . I could have warned them . I could have saved them . If they see us , they 'll strike again . Victory stands on the back of sacrifice . You know that . I want the Mountain Men dead , all of them . We need bandages ! Right here . It 's no use . She 's still alive . We save those who can be saved . I 'm so sorry . Lincoln , be careful . It 's not stable . They 're down there . Yaagh ! Do you hear someone ? Abby , I 'm sure Clarke is ok . We 'll find her . Indra . She 's alive . Oh , Indra . Raagh ! _ Oh ! Sniper ! Octavia , go . The spotter . He aimed the missile . He 's alone . Clarke , just slow down . If he is a spotter , he 's here to make sure we 're dead . If he tells the mountain were alive ... He won 't . How can you be sure ? Because I 'm gonna kill him . Agh ! Get down ! Lincoln , you must stop the bleeding . Uh ! - Indra , let me help you . - No . What do we do ? No ! Agh ! We 're trapped . I say we use the Sky Girl to draw fire . - You got a problem ? - Yes . You are the bringers of death . Uh ! Uh ! Help . Someone 's alive down there . Ah ... Ooh ! Jasper , where do you want this ? Put it here , no weak spots . We need to make sure they don 't get in . They won 't . We took the level , but now we have to hold it . They will be coming , and we need to be ready . Harper , get some pots from the kitchen , fill them with water , as big as you can find . Ok ? Watch out . Good , Fox . Let 's go get those hallway cameras , all right ? Nope . Leave the hallway cameras . We 'll need eyes out there . You can do that ? Have you met me ? Where are we on the doors ? Elevators are all disabled . I shorted the other stairwell locks . This one is tricky , though . I can 't seem to ... That works , too . How long you think we can hold them off ? As long as we have to . I 've got to get down there . Now . Aargh ! Go , go . Come on . Let 's take it ! Come on ! Gah ! What are we gonna do ? We can 't move . I 'm going for the shooter . I 'll sound the horn when it 's done . All right , my friend . I 'm going with you . No . Nyko needs you here . Are you sure you 're up to this ? _ - What can I do ? - Pressure here . This is my village . You 're the chief second . Save our people . We 're pinned down , and the other seconds won 't follow me . So make them . Indra ? Oh ... She 's losing too much blood . Indra . We have to do something . Thanks , Sky Girl , but there 's nothing to do until the sniper is dead . We are not ready for this . Yes , we are . Just follow the plan , we 'll be ok ... I promise . No guns . You were right . It 's because they can 't kill us , not like this , anyway . Be careful with that thing . We 're in close . You could hit one of us . Wait a second . Some of them aren 't wearing Hazmat suits . What 's it mean ? Means they 're cured . Marrow treatments worked . Get this down . Get ready . Get it open ! Let 's do it . We got it . Alpha team , go . Take it down . Go , go , go . Now ! Yaah ! Retreat ! Retreat . Pull back . Pull back now . Raah ! We did it ! Seal the barricade ! Jasper ! No ! No ! Jasper ! Fox ! Fox ! No ! No ! I told her she 'd be ok . I promised her . Ungh ... Ungh ... Uh ... Aah ! Oh ! Uh ! Hold on . I 'm coming . Marcus . Marcus , it 's ok . I 'm here . It 's ok . Abby . It 's my leg . You 're bleeding , but not bad . Can you move your toes ? - Yeah . - Good . I don 't think anything is broken . You 're lucky . I 'm gonna get you out of here . Nngh ! Aah ! Not that lucky . That could be Clarke . I 'm not leaving you here . Rrgh ! No ! Uh ! Uh ! Oh ... I 'll prep the table . Uh ! No . No . Uh ! Thanks . Bellamy ... You ok ? Ok . It 's all right . Gonna be ok . - Gonna be ok . - Come on . We have to get her someplace safe . You 're ok . - Dad , you 're home . - Yeah . The drill bit broke again . What are they doing here ? Look . They 're in trouble . We just need someplace safe to stay . They need to go now . Let me explain . How about you explain where he got that uniform ? Maya , you know how dangerous this is . What are you doing ? What mom would 've done . I need you to leave . Sorry . We can 't do that . That 's ok . He 's gonna help us . Really ? Because I 'm not getting that . My parents were part of a movement that was against using outsider blood . My mom refused the treatments , and it killed her . She was willing to die for what she believed in . Maya , you were 5 . I couldn 't leave you alone . Not a little girl anymore . They were willing to kill you before . If you get caught ... We won 't if you help us . Please . They 're killing us . We don 't have anywhere else to go . Just this once , just for one night . My room is this way . Thank you . You know they 'll never stop , right ? If the rumors are true and your bone marrow can get us back to the ground , they 'll never stop . It 'll be light soon . We won 't have the darkness to hide us . Neither will he . I feel your anger , Clarke . Do me a favor ... no more lessons . You need to focus . We do what we must to survive . The enemy does the same . It 's not personal . It is to me . You think that killing the shooter will make you feel better , but it won 't . The only thing that will do that is winning this war . That 's enough . Is it him ? No . Lincoln . Clarke ? Commander , wh ... Octavia said you were both ... - You 've seen Octavia ? - Yeah . The few that survived the explosion are being pinned down by a sniper . That 's why I 'm here . Come on . We need to get to the high ground . G 'uh ! Uh ! Uh ! Nngh ! Don 't move . Don 't move . Yaagh ! Your femoral artery is lacerated . The weight of the beam , it 's the only thing keeping you alive . Ha ! Hell of a bandage . Ohh ... I 'll figure it out . Abby , just ... Go find your daughter . If I can get a tourniquet around your leg , it buys us more time . Go find Clarke . She 's not here . She 's ... fine . Lexa , too . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Lovejoy 's key card will get you into the armory . The guns are locked , but the guard has the key . I can lure him away or ... No . There 's no time . Once I get the guns , how do I get them to level 5 ? They 're watching every door . Maybe not . The mess hall has a trash chute . A trash chute ? There 's one on every level . Best part ... no radiation alarms . The hatches leak like crazy . So they put in these airlocks just to be safe . You get the guns , I 'll get them into the mess hall . You 're a natural-born revolutionary . My mom was the revolutionary . I 'm just trying to do what 's right . Be back here in 30 minutes . Maya , we were just on our way to see you . How can I help you , Mr. President ? They 're gonna come in a lot hotter next time . You know that , right ? All we got to do is hold the floor until Bellamy finds a way out . We 're gonna need more than a bucket of water and 4 guns to do that . This is President Wallace talking to the people who just killed 10 of my men . Jasper . I thought we 'd try something a little different this time . There 's only 20 minutes of oxygen in Maya 's suit . I know she 's a friend of yours . 20 minutes , your friend will either suffocate or burn ... But you can save her . All you have to do is surrender . We can 't wait anymore . Our people are dying down there . If we can get to the crater , we can tunnel in from the side . There 's no cover . I 'll do it . Get back . Agh ! Any other bad ideas ? Ahh . Just one . Unh ! Unh ! Now what , Sky Girl ? Now we dig . Stay down . Stay down . Stay down . Move it . Hey , you 're ok . Listen to me . Fox is ok . Bellamy saved her . He 's gonna get some guns in here through the trash chute . If we can get guns in , we can get you out . No . We can 't . I dismantled the chute . I 'm sorry . I didn 't think we 'd be trying to open it ourselves . I can fix it . Thank you . Go help him . Harper ... I won 't let you die . I won 't let you surrender . Uh ! Mm ... Ah ... Uh ... Uh ! Uh ... Ungh ! Marcus ? Uh ! Marcus , Marcus , wake up . Open your eyes . You have to wake up . Marcus , open your eyes . Oh , I 'm so cold . I 'm right here . I 'm right here . I 'm ok . I 'm sorry , Marcus . I 'm so sorry . It 's not your fault , Abby . It is my fault . She 's my daughter . What are you talking about ? She knew . Clarke escaped ... before the attack . She knew it was coming . - Yes . - Oh ... How could she do something like this ? Because she grew up on the Ark . She learned what to do from us . She let this happen . She could 've stopped it . She made a choice , like executing people for stealing medicine and food ... like sucking the air from the lungs of 300 parents so they could save their children . Like floating the man you love ... to save your people . Yes . We have to answer for our sins , Abby . After everything we 've done , do we even deserve to survive ? She 's almost out of oxygen . It 's been 19 minutes . You 're not helping , Harper . Don 't worry . We 'll get it open , won 't we , Monty ? Almost there . Almost isn 't good enough . I just need to bypass the ... oh ! Screw this . What the hell did you do ? Cut the power to the motor . Help me . We can 't get leverage . There 's someone in there . They 're coming in ! Bellamy . Get her in here . Come on . Come on ! Go , go , go ! Hurry up . Uh ! Uh ! I got you . Decontamination complete . All clear . Dad , what are you doing here ? What your mother would have done . Come here . Ha ha ha ! Uh ! Hey , listen to me . Clarke is coming with an army of Grounders . What ? We have to keep all of you safe until then . And don 't tell me Finn finally got his peace talks . Something like that . Come on . We got a lot of work to do . So much for the element of surprise . I 'll draw his fire . No . I will . Aagh ! Hrrgh ! Uh ! Ah ! Drop the weapon . Gah ! Just let him kill me , then take him out . Go on , Clarke . Please . Your people need you . You are my people . Ah ... Uhh ! Uh ... Good shot . Did that make you feel better ? No . Ugh ! Uh ! Oh ! Aagh ! Uh ! It 's no use . Come on ! We can do this . Wait . Listen . Lincoln . He did it . We still can 't get them out . Want to bet ? Get back in there . It 's been 30 minutes . So the girl is dead by now . I know that , Lieutenant . They 've made their choice . Go in strong . Take them alive if you can , but take them . Copy that . Throwing flashbangs . Fire in the hole . Let 's go ! Go ! Mr. President ... Find them . It 's all clear . Won 't they see us ? Relax . Maya took out the cameras . Yeah , well , we 're still sitting ducks in a group like this . You 're right . So we 're gonna split up . No . We do this together . We survive together . Bellamy 's right . Well , they don 't trust Maya anymore . Who the hell is gonna help us now ? They are . We 're going to hide you . Not everyone here agrees with Cage , not by a long shot . Come with , me . We 'll divide you along the way . Let 's go . It 'll be ok . Let 's go . You 're safe now . Quick , quick . Go this way . That way . Go . Find your people . Find your people . Go . Hey , we 're coming with you . No , you 're not . They still don 't know I 'm here , and I need to keep it that way . So what do we do ? Stay alive . Be ready to fight . War is coming . Marcus ... Marcus , Marcus , wake up . Marcus , wake up . Wake up ! Uh ! Nngh ! Aah ! Uh ... Hold on . Hold on . Hold on . It 's still not working ! Sky people ! A group of them ! We saw the missile , heard the blast , figured you could use some help . Just in time . Thank you . Ok . All right . I need everybody on that rope . Make way . Let it through . Marcus ... Marcus ... Do you hear that ? We 've got two survivors . Abby , Kane , we 'll get you out of here . We 're gonna be ok . Bring them up ! Over here . Ugh ! Here you go . Ok . Oh ... You did it . Yeah . I had a little help . Kane needs blood , " O " neg . , right now . Abby , slow down . You 're bleeding . You need help , too . I 'm fine . Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! What happened here will not stand . The mountain will fall . The dead will be avenged ! Enough ! That 's enough . There are still others in the wreckage . We heard them . Go to work ! Let 's get a rope up here . Haul them up . Let 's go ! Wait till I say . With our two people working together , we 're gonna win this war , Clarke . You 're not ready . I will not miss this fight . You 've done well , Octavia of the Sky People . Today you saved lives . Tomorrow you 'll take them . Now get my gear . We leave with the commander . Wait . I thought you were dead . I 'm glad you 're not . You , too . How 's Kane ? He 'll live . We could really use your help . I can 't . We 're leaving . I 've arranged for a caravan to take you and the wounded back to Camp Jaha . Clarke ... The sniper wasn 't wearing a Hazmat suit . The marrow treatment works . They 're gonna kill all my friends . Then you better hurry . I need you to do something for me . Don 't forget that we 're the good guys . It 's time . May we meet again . ♪ It 's all for you ♪ ♪ you get the change and I give the truth ♪ ♪ it 's all for you ♪ ♪ take it to depths that they never knew ♪ ♪ I couldn 't stop , couldn 't stop , stop caring ♪ ♪ I couldn 't stop , couldn 't stop , stop caring ♪ ♪ I couldn 't stop , couldn 't stop , stop caring ♪ ♪ couldn 't stop , couldn 't stop , stop , stop caring ♪

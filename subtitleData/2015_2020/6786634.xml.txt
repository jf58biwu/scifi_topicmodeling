 Hello ? It 's over . Where are we ? What is this place ? It used to be the edge of the known world . It still is . Welcome to The Island of Doctor Moreau . What are you talking about ? Why have you let me out ? Rachel . The cure along with it . - Mum ... - I 'll speak . All right . You put my mother in the line of fire . and then you put me in the middle and you made it my fault . And now I don 't even have a body to bury . too . You came to me an orphan . That 's all you 'll ever be . do I ? - No . You 're not taking Kira where you 're going . You don 't know where I 'm going . I know too well . Kira stays with me . Cosima . Hey . What 's up ? You okay ? She had her killed right in front of me . She kept me alive so I could tell everybody that Kendall 's ... gone . And Delphine 's dead . okay ? I got your favourite . Bad coffee and a good croissant . I pushed Sarah to make that deal . I ... pushed us right into Evie 's trap . Scott . What are you doing over there ? I 'm gonna power up again . Why ? There 's nothing left . we 'll see . Lord ... I know I 've been a horrible sinner ... but we need hope now . We need ... fudge . Fudge it ! Fudge me ! - Honey ... Honey ? God . Donnie . Come here . Come here . - We 're gonna get through this . - Mmm-hmm . You take whatever time you need for the sisters . Donnie . I think maybe we should cancel Gemma 's slumber party . it 's ... it 's her birthday . Donnie . it 's too soon . and we 'll have cake with her ourselves . Gemma needs this night . It 's ... it 's important that we make this normal now for the kids . mister . I 'm putting my foot down . You can 't just capitulate to Evie Cho . LEDA is the cornerstone of Neolution . I was going to show you this when I came back with the original . There 's no point in hiding it any longer . Very few people are privy to the true history of Neolution . to this man . - Percival Westmorland ? - Mmm . - The industrialist ? - Born to industry . Drawn to Darwin and early eugenical thought . He used his resources to essentially create a secret scientific society . Percy sought to bring science to the task of breeding a better human . You 're sleeping in his very room . he built the facilities downstairs . I built on top of him . And now ... Evie Cho builds on top of me . I gave up everything to continue his legacy . you ... And now my time is over . How can you give up ? like you wanted . I want to take my place with you . We still need to find a cure . Look what you 've done for me . Look at my eye . It 's almost perfect . But I 'm afraid Evie has usurped us . I 've only seen you cry a handful of times . if you like . love ? Of course . Where 's Sarah ? She 's gone . She go out ? Mummy left again . No . She doesn 't do that any more . She did . No . Not like before . is it ? Your mum can look after herself . She 's well good at that . you listen to me . Don 't listen to S. You listen to your little heart . all right ? Mmm-hmm . Okay . You should know better . Everything is gonna get worse if Sarah goes off the rails . but she 's the glue that 's holding us all together . Hey ! Two more . Is anything recoverable ? completely obliterated your data . Evie 's covered her bases . we have nothing . We 're back to square one . We still have a live vector . Which didn 't work . Every single test failed . Why would we repeat an experiment if we don 't even know what the flaw is ? or if it 's even the right vector . So ... let 's think outside the box . There you go . Listen to your lab partner . too . Scottie . actually . So there 's gotta be something you haven 't thought of . - What the heck is that ? - Sarah 's bot . I poached it from Evie 's office . little buddy . I wonder if you can tell us anything . bearded . She thought maybe the detective you tied to Beth . It 's Martin Duko . That 's Beth 's union steward . Does he work for Evie Cho ? drove her to try and kill Susan . Arthur ... for sticking with us . congratulations . Your science has won . Dr Van Lier . Shingles . Yes . A side effect of leaning on immunosuppressants most of my life . Well ... you brought gene therapy a long way . Evie . " This is a science of nanometres . I am so proud of you . You have pending approval for the world 's first gene therapy implant . it 's effective ... even the Brightborn CEO is doing it . You 'll be first to take the new generation of bot this week . Those shingles will be a thing of the past . And so will human clones . How are you feeling ? Mother . Just glad you 'll be here to share in my retirement . Ira . Rachel ! That 's all right . Let 's just not talk about it any more . - Are we ready ? - Mmm . Susan . Evie . Laura . Raymond . I thought it fitting that Rachel represent LEDA in transition . Rachel . I ... Cat got your tongue ? That 's okay . It 's just a courtesy call . So ... the architecture of Neolution is under our control . Finance and Legal are backing my patents now . After investing billions ? Squandering for years . the monitor program terminated . And my subjects ? Naive clones are being cut loose . No need for a Helsinki event . anyway . However ... Sarah and her self-aware sisters are still a threat . They won 't get such humane treatment . I can help with that . Rachel . I 'm not my sisters . I 'm Neolution bred . Do you actually think Neolution would let a clone take a position of real importance ? Cheers . now . Oi ! but my local is another story . I should 've known this was the kind of shithole that you would inhabit . now ... a man 's watering hole is sacred . that 's it . Don 't worry . cheers . - Cheers . Did you find out anything more about that implant ? What 'd I just say to you ? if not clones and conspiracies ? titillate me . Slippery nipple ? Slippery what ? Nipple . It 's a kind of shot . But this is just bourbon . Bourbon 's my drink . over there ? - Yeah . that 's Tito . I 'm Elle . - You wanna introduce us ? - I 'd love to . Come over . You coming or what ? Yeah ... wouldn 't wanna miss anything . so if you could be of some assistance ? Ali ... even if the decorations aren 't symmetrical . Please don 't ... please . but ... I really want you to be able to talk to someone . Even if that isn 't me . What does that mean ? I invited Reverend Mike over to help with the ghost stories . there ! - Hi ! Hendrixes ! I 'm not prepared for this . - Hi ! - Hi ! tidings of great joy . Reverend .

I 'm ... I 'm on my way there now . That was for Kendall Malone ... and this is for Beth ! - You fri ... You frickin ' psycho . You killed for them ! And all Beth wanted was the truth ! Arthur . Gimme the shoe leather . Get that outta your system ? That 's pretty much all you can do about that . Duko ... we 're just getting started . What are you gonna do ? You 're gonna bring ' em all down ? starting with you . Then Evie Cho . You can 't stop them . But they 're watching you . Collaborating with Sarah . Abetting the Hendrixes . And what about Beth 's shooting ? The cell phone in the victim 's hand ? Who really put that there ? Arthur . Then the only question you really should be asking yourself right now is ... Where is that next blow gonna land ? How about right here ? The island is really big . How big ? As big as a country . and beyond the walls there 's monsters . I 'm afraid we 're the only monsters here . And it isn 't an island . It 's more of a prison for us . That 's silly . You 're a big girl . You need to know the truth . You and I have a problem . One that we share with Ira . What is it ? You 're sick . You 've already displayed symptoms . That 's why Susan 's been testing you . Rachel . It 's nothing to worry about . it is . Charlotte . too . towards the back door ... she heard it again . The knocking . And there on the back step ... Ryan . or ... - was he a ghost ? hey . It 's you . You 're still here . I guess I am . Got a problem with that ? her boyfriend or something ? and we decided to have an open relationship . why don 't you just piss off . don 't tell my mate Dizzy to piss off . Piss ... off . - Hey ! easy ! what did I just say ? - Don 't touch her . Come here ! Come here ! ya ... you come here ! Little wanker ! great . Get the cops down here now . It 's like babysitting some football hooligan . West Hams ! - West Hams ! Sing it ! West Hams ! - That 's enough . - Yeah ? All right . - And where 's our next drink coming from ? Yours ? something to take you down a bit . - Is that what you need ? uh ... I can be honest if you can . he wants to talk . - all right ? - Mmm . too . they killed him . Is that Ed Capra ? That 's right . How do you know him ? You need to stop talking now . All right . I can do that . Hey . Your implant ... it 's gone . How did you get rid of it ? didn 't I ? come on . I 'm out . mate . but just listen . My ... my friend Ed wasn 't the only one with one of those things driving him crazy . You know how to get rid of it . I don 't know anything ! All right ? I wanted a bit of fun . You can 't even get it up . Wanker ! Stop following me ! I 'm not ! You 're in my place . Jesus Christ . A ball of fire made the ghosts explode ! away from all the ghosts . And she was drifting off to sleep when she heard ... at her chamber door . Daddy ? and it was the ghost holding ... - a birthday cupcake ! I 'll get it . yeah . - With a birthday cupcake ? - With a birthday cupcake . I might eat it . - Police ! my God ! - Donald Hendrix ? my God ! You 're under arrest . - What are you doing ? - Down ! Down ! Everybody get down ! Get down on the ground ! - Get him up ! Hands behind your back . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! What is this about ? It 's a children 's slumber party ! You 're under arrest for trafficking of narcotics . You have the right to the aid of attorney . Get up ! Come on . one will be provided . my God . - Honey ? maybe uncle ... Alison . - Where are they taking my husband ? - He 's gonna be fine . I 'm taking your husband downtown . And you and I ... we are going to need to keep in touch . How are you holding up ? Kendall was quite a loss . chicken . - You okay ? - I 'm fine . - Mmm ... you 're not . None of us are . Is it really Mummy 's fault Granny died ? Mmm ... It 's a whole lot more complicated than that . Mummy thinks it 's her fault . That 's why she ran away . But she 'll be back . she won 't . This time she 's following Beth . Amazing how it healed itself . so ... we compared Sarah 's DNA pre - and post-bot . We couldn 't see any change . flipping switches on and off . You think there 's a chance it could turn it off in you ? - That 's crazy . It could just as easily turn something else against you . it 's too risky . we wouldn 't even know how to implant it . Cut a hole in my face and stick it in . Probably not . let 's eat . Cosima . too . guys . Um ... just gonna grab ... Cosima ? what are you doing ? What are you doing ? I 'm trying to buy a train ticket . and I don 't even have a credit card . use mine . you maxed it out already . It 's okay . I didn 't need it any more . I never knew you were funny . That 's a relief . I 'm talking to a dead person . You gonna follow me for the rest of my life ? I hope . please ! Open up the door ! Cosima ! open the door ! Scottie . come on . Think for a second . You 've got no idea what this thing is going to do to you . It 's risk versus reward . the risk is so high ... the reward is my death helps the sisters understand the disease . I didn 't want this . I didn 't want you . I didn 't want any bloody sisters . You hear me ? Leave me alone ! I wish you would just ... What ? What are you looking at ? Eh ? - Piss off . We would have been better off if we never crossed paths . I 'm so mad . Beth ? It 's only like 40 feet down . you might just end up like Rachel . No ! now you 're worried about Sarah ? Kira said something . You know the way she is . She said Sarah is following Beth . Mum ! This is what I was talking about . This is what I tried to tell you . will you just ... Hang on . Scott ? Hello ? and I think she might do something medically crazy to herself . Like what ? so you need to tell me . Felix . She blames herself for Kendall . She blames herself for Delphine . Krystal . I 'm such an idiot . I completely forgot . please . Cosima ! Just keep going towards the train station . Thank you . I 'm looking for someone . Cosima ! Felix is calling . Pick up ! open the door ! Cosima ! Cosima . Pick up your bloody phone . I think we way overbuilt that . answer your phone ! You need to talk to Felix ! Krystal told him something important . Felix . because this is about Delphine . What about her ? she found herself on the trail of Delphine . and that 's bad . she saw someone else pick her up . And Delphine was alive when they took her away . okay ? Thank you . We 're in this together . Just hang on . shit . Hey ! Stop the car . I gotta go . please ? - Thank you . Sarah . There 's something else . too . Sarah . is it ? Sarah . Sarah . We need you . Kira . Who are you ? - How do you know my name ? - Don 't worry . I 'm a friend . You 're the girl in the shadows . Am I ? You can call me Mika . Good morning . Susan ? Is anybody there ? Dear God . Rachel ? Ira ? did you see it ? What happened ? You must have hit your head . It looked at me . I ... I saw something in my eye . aren 't we ?

 Previously on " agent carter " ... As of this moment , howard stark is a fugitive from justice . May I introduce you to miss dorothy underwood ? Oh , call me dottie . Return to your room , please . [ groans ] What 's in the vial ? Steve rogers ' blood . I trusted you , howard ! I know , and I was wrong . Photographer got a shot of the blonde Who was with spider before he got killed , But not one clear shot of her face . What did the lab rats say about your magic typewriter ? They 're claiming it sends signals back and forth . To where , we don 't know yet . [ metal clangs ] [ sighs ] [ handcuffs clicking ] [ indistinct whispering ] She 'll never find me here . All : She 'll never find me here . And if you let me stay ... And if you let me stay I 'll keep house for you . ... I 'll keep house for you . I 'll wash and sew and sweep and cook . [ both grunting ] [ gasping ] [ bone cracks ] [ breathing heavily ] [ horns honk in distance ] [ panting ] [ big-band music plays ] What does " ennui " mean ? Uh , it 's like melancholy , Um , sadness born out of tedium or boredom . Mm . Why do you ask ? She said she was " too consumed by ennui " to come to work today . Oh , and to think , her acting teacher said She wasn 't dramatic enough . [ chuckles ] yeah . Sounds french . Baguette ? [ chuckles ] go on . I can never finish mine . Hey , you got a pen ? Mm . [ clears throat ] do you think I could convince angle To come out and give me a tour of the city ? I still get lost , but I want to see everything . And I want to see the best things first . So , first up , central park and then empire state building And then trinity church and then statue of liberty . What do you think ? [ bell rings ] Peggy ? Hello ? [ both chuckle ] Oh , um , tourist traps . I 'm sorry . If you want to get to know new york ... If you want to get to know any place ... You have to start with the people first . I talk to people . Real people with real jobs . Not the , uh , phony , superficial ones that pervade this city . Uh , you should start with brooklyn first . But I-I 'd rather see the statue of liberty . Oh , she 'll still be there . But what she represents , the spirit of lady liberty , Is found in its people . Wow . You sounded just like captain america just now . That 's no bad thing . Hmm . Well ... oh , my gosh ! Oh . I am so sorry . I 'm such a klutz . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . There 's no harm done . Let me , let me , let me . [ chuckles nervously ] here you go . Oh .

Thanks . [ bell rings ] [ indistinct conversations ] Beautiful morning , huh , peggy ? Feels like home . Missing England , huh ? Well , missing something . Mm . Copy of the ledger , please . Good day , pete . Bye . Miss carter , I beg only one moment of your time . You 've had your moment , mr . Jarvis . If you or howard have anything else to say , I tried to persuade mr . Stark to tell you the truth . You could have told me yourself . Well , given my current situation , I didn 't see how that was possible . Yes , how could it ever be possible ? " howard stark wants you to steal captain america 's blood . " Oh , yes , look . It is possible . Howard didn 't want my help to prove his innocence . He wanted a new toy to manipulate . That mr . Stark has the greatest admiration . Only for himself . He can be thoughtless ... Inconsiderate , vain , Childish , unreliable , arrogant ... You flatter him . ... But he is a good man . He used me . He uses you , whether you choose to see it or not . He needs your help , miss carter . What he needs is a servant , and he already has that in you . And what does the ssr have in you ? I am a federal agent , mr . Jarvis . Yes . Finely trained and skilled in the art of fetching coffee . These men you call your colleagues ... They don 't respect you . They don 't even see you . Do you honestly expect they 'll change their minds ? I expect I will make them . [ elevator bell dings ] Man : Billy , I got the white house holding for the chief on line 2 . Daniel , what 's going on ? Sasha demidov 's magic typewriter turned itself on all by itself . What did the message say ? It 's encoded . We got a cryptographer Up from arlington hall trying to crack it . He , uh , stinks at his job . Man : It 's clearly not a german cipher , Or the turing method would work . What will work , in your estimation , huh ? You already looked through that book 10 times . I 'm gonna have to take this back with me to virginia , Where I can run it ... you 're not taking it anywhere . Look , as difficult as it might be for you people to understand , I can 't just beat a code into submission Yeah ? That works great with pencil pushers like you . May I see it ? I saw this at bletchley . It 's a one-time pad system . Did you account for the original message being written in russian ? Can you read it ? They are map coordinates . 53 degrees , 72 minutes north , 27 degrees , 37 minutes west . " purchase confirmed . Exchange at 0800 , April 27th . " That 's less than two days from now . Coordinates are in the mar 'ina horka forest in belarus . " leviathan ... To acquire prototype ... Havoc reactor . " I 'm sorry . Leviathan ? As far as I know , it 's an old testament sea monster ... Who types , apparently . No . It 's a covert russian organization , supposedly . I always just assumed it was a spook story . Their group wanted to purchase weapons to fight the allies . Well , if they 're real and she 's reading that right ... She is trying to concentrate , thank you . " payment of ... $ 100,000 american upon delivery ... " payable to ... Howard stark . " Hot damn ! We got him . We got stark red-handed selling weapons to the russians . Take a team to belarus . Find stark , bring him home . Li , ramirez , gear up . You 're going to russia . Li , ramirez , and carter . Come again ? There 's no one more qualified for this mission , sir . I am going to russia . Are you really considering letting carter come ? What did I just say ? Chances are leviathan will continue to communicate in code , Which means that the team needs my skills as a code breaker , All the more reason not to saddle me and my guys with babysitting her . Would you prefer to have a nanny wipe your noses ? I might . Enough . It 's your team , thompson . What do you want ? [ sighs ] look , it 's great that carter cracked the code . I am proud of her . I am . But we have no idea what we 're getting into over there , okay ? You need someone who speaks the language and understands the region . The eastern front , the western front , and everything in between . Yeah , surrounded by some of our best men . Agent thompson , do you know what the smell of herring in the air Mmm . Someone 's having a fish fry . It means there is wind blowing in from the baltic . It means a snow storm in July , and if you can smell the wind , It means you have 30 minutes to find shelter and build a fire Before you die of hypothermia in the morning . I know all of this because I 've been there . Now I know , too . Look , put yourself in my shoes , carter . I send you on this mission , you get yourself killed , I 'm the moron who got a woman killed in action . I send you and one of my guys buys it , I 'm the one who set him up to die . I know you 've spent time in russia , But we 're putting together a european tac team That knows the terrain . Not like I do . Not like the 107th regiment . The europeans don 't even know europe as well as the 107th . You think I wouldn 't snatch them up if I could ? What would you say if I could deliver them ? I 'd say , " pack your bags , " but that 's not gonna happen . [ chuckles ] I 'm gonna miss her . I mean , come on , chief , You 're not actually thinking about letting carter go to ... Son , I like you , but I 'm running an office here . I got the vice president of the United States Asking me when I 'm gonna deliver him howard stark . At the same time , I got a nazi war criminal Telling me stark 's involved in a massacre . I 'm trying to run an investigation here , And I don 't have time on my docket For your little crush on carter . Yes , sir . Okay , uh , I 'm thinking we fly the team over there , We land on the polish side of the russian border , We meet the tac team there , okay ? Then ... The 107th will meet us At the polish side of the russian border . That is the plan , isn 't it ? It is the most obvious one . Gear up . You roll out in an hour . That 's all . [ indistinct muffled conversation ] [ sighs ] Carter , if you 're looking for a peep show , try times square . This is the only changing room in the ssr . I need to change . Try the ladies ' room . The ladies ' room is downstairs in the lobby of the ad agency . I 'd match rather suffer the musk of a men 's locker room Than have to change into tactical gear In a public restroom . Pull up your skirts , boys . Whoa ! Geez , carter , give a guy some warning . Carter : Oh , such fuss . Do none of you have sisters ? They don 't look like you . Come on , congratulate the lady . She 's on the team . Jack , you really think that 's a good idea ? Not my call . I got six guys out there who 'd love to take your place . Oh , this is new . It 's lighter than it looks . Lab boys just dropped it off . It 's 10 % titanium alloy . Although , I don 't think they had 38-22-38 in mind Math isn 't your forte , is it , agent thompson ? Or is that just words in general ? That 's " words in general , sir . " Yes , sir , lieutenant junior grade , sir . Guess you 're used to serving under a captain , huh ? Just not used to serving with boys . Field report . Maps , weather , charts , all known bogey dope for the area , Though carter 's pretty much all the intel you need on them . Thorough as ever , sousa . Oh , compass . Compass . Almost forgot my compass . Uh , locker 42 . Would you grab that for me , pal ? Oh , bloody nora ! Whoa , nelly ! Uh , you 're ... Yes , e-everything 's fine . Uh ... Found it ! You don 't have to worry about it , sousa . [ clears throat ] is there anything else , daniel ? Uh ... Uh ... ? No . " n-no " ? Yes ? Have a swell trip . Right . Thank you . [ sighing ] Relax . You 'll sprain something . It 's just as you remember it . You a mind reader , Or is that your woman 's intuition speaking ? How 's this for woman 's intuition ... This is your first jump , isn 't it ? Ninth . Eight training jumps . You 've infiltrated hostile territory before . You 'll be fine . Just follow our lead . Thanks , carter , but I already have a mother . What I need right now are soldiers . Let 's go , boys ! It 's go time ! [ alarm blaring ] the drop will put us 10 kilometers From our rendezvous with our tac team , Assuming they 're where they 're supposed to be . They 'll be there . They better be . We 're eight klicks east of the rv . I 'll take lead . Carter , you 're in back . Stay tight . [ guns cock ] don 't move . Emu . What ? " ostrich , " man . " ostrich . " Shut up . Emu . Carter , dugan forgot the password again . Carter : Password is " eagle , " you apes . Oh , hi , peggy . Fellas . Thompson , that 's dum-dum dugan . Jack thompson , mike li , rick ramirez , This is " junior " juniper , " pinky " pinkerton , " happy sam " sawyer , you seem to know dum-dum dugan ... The 107th , our tactical team . Sawyer : Yeah , I hate that name . I came up with that name . That you did . Dugan , you fought side-by-side with captain america , didn 't you ? Yeah . But not as long as she did . Agent jack thompson . I 'm running point for the ssr . We head due east till we hit the border . We 'll hit a wall of reds before we reach the border . Let 's head up into lithuania , Cross over into russia at ashmyany . You planning on walking halfway across lithuania ? Well , you can if you want . But me ? I 'm taking these . Peggy , let 's go . Did you bring what I asked for ? From my own private stash . Ah , attagirl . See , the germans are geniuses when it comes to beer , But no one knows bourbon like the u.S. Of a . [ chuckles ] Cheers . Cheers . [ sighs ] [ sighs ] All right , so , tell me , What 's the story with stark and these leviathan jerks ? The ssr is convinced that howard is trying To sell technology to enemies of the United States . They think leviathan is a potential buyer . And you disagree ? Howard isn 't selling weapons To adversaries of the United States ... Not to leviathan , not to anybody . He may be an utter wanker , but he is one of us . So you think the whole deal is a trap . It 's always a damn trap . That 's why we bring the guns . Question is , if leviathan is trying To lure us in with promises of capturing howard , Then what is it that they really want ? Maybe it 's just the pleasure of your company . Hey ! You smell bad enough . And you used to be fun . Yeah , once upon a time . [ sighs ] Yeah . [ clicks tongue ] I miss him , too . Don 't you have a life ? [ sighs ] I 'm an ssr agent , sir . My job is my life . [ chuckles ] What are you still doing here ? I 'm meeting a friend for a drink . Figured if I went home , wife might not let me out again . [ chuckles ] Women , right ? Women . Good night . Thanks , yauch . Mm-hmm . [ sniffs ] [ gasps ] Hey , go easy on those beans , okay ? [ laughter ] coast is clear . Li and ramirez are on the night watch . We should be good to go at first light . Which means we stand relieved . You see any abominable snowmen like the one in tibet ? I ... I never said , " a-abominable snowman . " In fairness , he did specify " yeti . " Yeah . Dugan : Sorry , it was a little hard to make out words In between all the sobbing . [ laughter ] shut up . It was scary . [ gulps ] So , what is the difference Between a yeti and an abominable snowman ? One 's real and one isn 't . [ laughter ] what ? So , I hear they have , uh , mermaids in japan . You see any of them when you were out there ? Yeah , story time . I got nothing you guys ain 't heard before . Did a lot of ground work , dug a lot of trenches . They don 't give out navy crosses just for digging trenches . [ inhales deeply ] Navy cross . [ sighs ] Hmm . All right . [ groans ] 1945 . Tsuken island . Nothing detail . I fall asleep on the night shift . I wake up ... six japanese soldiers walking into my camp , Just waltzing in in the dark . One of them bends down over my sleeping c.O. One more second , he 'd slit his throat . Snapped to . Shoot him in the back . Shoot them all ... Before they even knew I was there . Before my last man was even awake . [ chuckles ] Truth be told , I like the kid 's yeti story better . What are you , a history buff now ? [ chuckles ] something like that . Anything you can tell me about the battle of finow ... Anything I don 't already know ... buys you a scotch . 247 dead russians massacred In a battle no one will take credit for . Where 's my drink ? That one I knew . Cheap does not become you , rog . [ chuckles ] scotch for my friend . Man : Coming up . I wrote a piece on it for the times . Should have won a pulitzer prize for it , too . How did I not read that one ? Ah , my editor killed it . I guess that 's what happens when you implicate the army And howard stark in a russian cover-up . What 's stark got to do with finow ? He was there for the , uh , clean up of the massacre . The guy in charge wasn 't too thrilled about it , either . General ... one star . Mcginnis ? Died of a heart attack a month ago . Stark took a swing at him right there in front of his men . You 'd think a guy as smart as stark Wouldn 't , uh , hit someone twice his size . Even gandhi 's got a sensitive spot . [ laughs ] Tell him his kids are ugly and see what happens . What do you think stark 's was ? All I know is mcginnis wiped the floor with him . Mm-hmm . Then resigned a week later . A week after that , stark walks away From a seven-figure rd contract with the army And cuts all ties with them . And now stark is public enemy number one . Yeah , we 're not railroading him . We got evidence . Yeah , what you don 't have is the whole story . Somebody does , But they 're keeping it to themselves . Well , not for long . Looks like we beat the bad guys here . So we could have slept for another hour ? Well , then we wouldn 't have the advantage of surprise , Would we , timothy ? So , we infiltrate in four teams of two ... you , you , you , us . No weapons discharge unless absolutely necessary . Meet on the ground floor in 30 . Clear ? Carter ? Agent thompson 's lead . You got a better idea ? Let 's hear it . Four teams of two is faster . Two teams of four is safer . Discretion seems to be the order of the day . We don 't know what we 're walking into . Okay . You four . Happy sam , pinkerton , ramirez , you 're with me . Good ? Aces . Does anybody else feel a chill going up their knickers ? I would if I wore knickers . [ projector whirring ] Li : Oh , sorry . Shut that thing off . Wait . Help ! [ horn honks ] help ! Help ! Help ! [ whirring stops ] " instill ... " " ... Fear . " Really regretting a lack of knickers right now . [ child crying ] There 's a little kid crying . What 's a little kid doing in this place ? Careful . Li : Little-kid beds ? Carter : It 's a boarding school . Why are there shackles on the beds ? It 's russia , man . [ crying continues ] peggy . Hey , there . You okay ? It 's all right . We 're here to help . It 's all right . We 're not here to hurt you . [ whimpers ] Oh , my hat ? You like my hat ? It 's called a bowler hat . The reason they call it that is because ... Why do they call it a bowler , peggy ? [ grunts ] [ grunts ] [ grunts , panting ] Dugan , she 's just a little girl . She 's anything but that . Dugan , no ! You all right ? Yeah . The vest took the brunt of it . What happened ? Leviathan has been alerted to our presence . We 've come too far to turn back now . We need to move ... quickly . [ grunts ] [ breathing heavily ] We 're gonna need an exit out the back . We can 't leave until we know who 's setting howard up . Dugan , pinky , ramirez , find a back way out of here . The rest , come with me . Jarvis : Till next week ! Send my love to your wife ! [ indistinct conversations ] [ bell jingles ] You don 't ever alter your routine , do you ? Are you here to threaten me with deportation again ? Or , wonder of wonders , have you come to apologize ? The words you 're looking for are " I 'm " and " sorry . " Your boss has a lot of enemies . I 'll alert edward r . Murrow . One of them was a u.S. Army general named john mcginnis . They got into a fistfight On a european battlefield in the spring of ' 44 . That ring a bell ? I remember a time not long ago ... A time when you said you were here to tell me something . It 's my one and only question . I 've never heard of this general Or any fistfight on any european battlefield . Your turn . There are three sides to every story , mr . Jarvis ... Your side , my side , and the truth . Tell stark I 'm not interested in any witch hunt . I just want to get to the truth . If he 's willing to tell his side of the story , I ... I 'd really like to hear it . I can be reached at this number 24 hours a day . Stay dry . Sawyer , stay here . Keep an eye out . Rest of you are with me . Clear . [ russian accent ] you are not leviathan . Who are you ? We 're the good guys . [ lock clicks ] [ grunts ] [ british accent ] hello . I 'm peggy carter . The acquired some schemata in the black market ... A weapon they don 't know how to build . They want us to build it for them . So you 're engineers ? He is the engineer . I serve as nikola 's terapevt ... psychiatrist . So the reds locked up a head doctor And a mad scientist to build a bomb . Sure , why not ? He is not mad . He is burdened . Look , he sees things in dimensions You look at a field of grass , you see pretty picture . He sees biology , phytochemistry . Keeping his gifts from overwhelming him ... This requires discipline , stability . Since leviathan took his family , stability does not come easy . I provide the discipline he needs . This weapon leviathan wants you to build ... what is it ? Oh , it 's beautiful . It 's a photonic amplifier . Okay , you understand light is both particles and waves ? Mm-hmm . Mr. Stark has found a way Of altering the behavior of the waves . Stark . Yeah . Of course . It 's his design right here . Is howard stark here ? No , of course not ! They stole the schemata ! I mean , if he was here , The leviathan would have no need for me . If he was here , I would be in kiev with my wife ! Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah . You thought you would find howard stark here ? That 's why you came ? I have heard no mention of stark himself from our captors . Only the work . Sawyer : Incoming ! [ gunshots ] Please ! Please ! Back away . [ indistinct shouting ] Go ! Now ! Man : Move out ! [ indistinct shouting ] Go , go , go ! Dugan , we 're in the boiler room . We need an exit . [ indistinct shouting ] Gentlemen , if you know the way Out of this facility , now 's the time to share it . Yeah , use your big brain and get us ... Li ! Above you ! Clear ! Man : Let 's go ! [ groans ] [ indistinct shouting ] I know what to do . I know what to do . [ speaking russian ] What is he saying ? Is it bad ? It 's bad , isn 't it ? Doctor , this is not the answer . We will not be your leverage . We will die before we are captured . Nikola , listen to me . I want you to focus on the sound of my voice . Are you listening , nikola ? Then listen to me ! You 've got one chance of getting out of here alive , And it 's because of our good graces ! You kill our friend , And you will die at our hand instantly ! So you have until the count of three To put down your weapon and fall to your knees ! One ! [ voice breaking ] I am sorry , nikola . [ indistinct shouting ] Dugan , where the hell is my exit ? ! Out of ammo ! Thompson , li 's ammo pack . Thompson ! Lieutenant . [ heart beating ] Uh ... Dugan , I 'm about to get very cross with you . [ grunts ] [ gasps ] [ guns cock ] wah-hoo ! Look at this mess . We were gone five minutes . Everybody out ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Thompson , I said everybody ! [ indistinct shouting ] Thompson ! Snap out of it , mate . Come on . Get your arse into gear . I 'm up . I 'm up . [ grunts ] [ indistinct shouting ] Peggy , go , go ! You go ! What would cap say if I left his best girl behind ? He would say , " do as peggy says . " Run , peggy ! Run ! Don 't look behind ! Let 's go ! [ grunts ] Go , go , go , go ! [ breathing heavily ] [ coughs ] [ chuckles ] not bad ... For a girl . I hate you all . Good luck . Thank you . Ramirez . It was an honor . You sure you want to get on that plane ? Commandos can always use another good fighter . We just need to come up with a nickname for you . I put my days on the front lines behind me . Someone needs to mind the wheel back in the states . And I suppose someone needs to convince the ssr Of howard 's innocence , wanker or not . I 'll miss you . Miss you , too , peggy . Wait a second . Miss " u " ... miss union jack . What do you think , fellas ? Huh ? Never speak again . Okay . And , doc , what about you ? Need a ride home ? Uh , I do not know where is home anymore . What do you think of new york ? The ssr could use your help fighting leviathan . I 'll do anything I can . We 'll keep europe in one piece . Doc . [ chuckles ] pleasure . Oh . You wouldn 't have any vodka ? Hmm . Desperate times , I suppose . [ coughs ] this is terrible . Might I have the rest ? It 's all yours . Doc . Bye-bye , bourbon . You all right ? Yeah . You saved a lot of necks back there . You saved mine . Not bad for a code breaker . Pretty bad for the navy cross winner . Everybody freezes sometimes . You recovered . That 's the most important thing . They were carrying a white flag . The soldiers that came into my camp in okinawa ... The ones I killed . They were coming to surrender . I just didn 't realize it until it was too late . I buried the flag before anyone else saw it . Everybody thinks that I 'm this guy that I never was . And every day ... It gets harder and harder to live with . [ groans ] I 've been trying to tell that story Since I came home from war . You just did . [ indistinct conversation ] Agent li died honorably in action . It 's my sworn duty as his commanding officer To deliver the condolences of the United States to his family . No stark , no leviathan . No , sir . But agent carter was able to acquire intel about leviathan From dr . Ivchenko about the enemy 's possible end game . We were able to retrieve him from a leviathan prison . He 's very eager to cooperate with the ssr in any way he can . But he doesn 't think stark 's connected to the leviathan ? No . And I don 't , either . Noted . He may not have all the information , sir . He was working off stark blueprints . Smart money says that leviathan Got them directly from stark himself . Send the doctor in on your way out . Good work , carter . Thanks , sir . How is it that you 're the one Who looks like he hasn 't slept for two days ? Just staying up late , worrying about you guys . You did good . Thanks , daniel . Sousa , you coming ? You can buy me a drink for every red I killed . Not tonight , jack . Pillow 's calling . Ah . Come on , carter . I owe you a bourbon . I 'll be right there . Are you sure you don 't want a drink ? Some other time . Thanks . Right . Well , goodnight . Night . [ chuckles ]

 [ theme music playing ] It 's still not exactly the same ... but I think it 's close enough . Will it work ? It should , but since I don 't understand exactly what it 's doing , I can 't be sure . - I 'm just gonna have to test it . - Oh , not alone . We should do it together . Hmm ... It would give us more control if something goes wrong . I could come to Bombay after London . How 's Will ? Not good . What happened was awful . But it isn 't his fault . He shouldn 't blame himself for his father 's death . What 's hard for Will is that all the things that were broken between them ... they can 't ever be fixed . Can I ask you something ? And if it 's inappropriate , please tell me . I know sometimes I say things I shouldn 't . No , you don 't . I would ask the same thing . You want to know what it 's like between Will and me . It 's much more intense than when I visit with any of you . It 's more physical . I never understood the word " presence " until we were together . And if you 're wondering about the sex ... no matter what I say , it won 't be enough . Yeah , it 's pretty amazing . And what about now ? What 's it like when one of you is in pain ? Right now , I can feel his grief . It 's only bearable because the alternative is not .

You 've been hiding ? It 's difficult for me in Berlin right now . Because of Lila ? I was surprised you came to the restaurant . Surprised ? Why ? Maybe everything would be easier for you if I wasn 't ... No . No , don 't you dare . I don 't know when my life became so confusing . I don 't know how to fix it . Because , for me , fixing something does not mean shooting someone with a rocket launcher , to which I would like to point out that much of your present trouble is a direct result of this kind of violent choice , so the jury is most definitely still out as to whether that is ever a good solution to anything , but ... I know ... I know ... that I don 't want to hurt Rajan . But ... I also know that if something were to happen to you ... if I were no longer able to feel what I ... feel when ... I know my life would no longer feel worth living . I will come to Bombay . You can 't . - What ? - You can 't . Enough .

I owe him the truth . Will would come over , we 'd do it together . But Will 's not here . He ain 't fucking here . Should a man in his condition really be drinking ? I found him on the floor . On the floor ? Will was working with Jonas Maliki . They 're lies ! They 're lies . No one believed me . Not even my dad . You 're actually out of your fucking mind . Dad , you 've gotta believe me . Will , help me . Will , please . Help me . - It 's about Sara , Dad . - Oh , no . I know . You want to run as far from the pain as you can . Dad ! Come back ! I know , baby .

I know things were difficult between you and your father . Maybe ... Maybe you didn 't go to your father because , in the end , he wasn 't that important to you . Maybe you 're not the son you thought you were . I can imagine facing that truth would be particularly painful . [ snorts , grunts ] You and I ? We are getting closer and closer , Will . [ Spanish hip-hop playing ] Mr. Wrangler will see you now . Okay . Mr. Bak wants everything to be perfect . You are the face of his hospitality . There will be a lot of foreign guests ... so you have to be ready for a variety of tastes . Make me a Sidecar . Look , Lito , here 's the thing . I 'm old-school . Box office bores me .

You don 't , I don 't care how many fans you have , you mean less to me than the shit I took this morning . Sit . I 'll be honest with you , I watch your films and I see the same male apery that has spread like a cancer through this industry , and I 'm sure this meeting is a waste of my time . But ... I watched your speech , and I felt , " Maybe , maybe , this is my Jordi . " So , do you , uh ... do you know the scene ? Yes , yes . I know ... I know the lines . Okay , good . Then break my heart .

Yes , of course . I 'm sorry , sir . Fuck apologies . - Start again . I want truth . - Okay . The truth . The truth is ... this is important , but ... The truth is ...

Please . Please . Okay . Well , first of all , Jordi would never wear this . Not this . No . Not the shoes . Those go . Not these pants . I mean ... Don 't worry . Don 't worry . I 've always said that if all the world 's a stage , then identity is nothing more than a costume . Let 's see ... What about that ? There we go . Let 's see ... Those pants , please ? Sir ? Thank you . Um , darling ? Can I borrow that ? Thank you . Nice . Not quite . Um , let 's see , um ... how about that hat ? Let me see the hat . - Thanks a lot . - Oh , yes . This is good . This is good . Here we go . Oh , he looks amazing . Just a sketch . Look in the mirror . Who is that ? Who is that ? Who do you see ? Jordi ? Yes . [ mouths ] Oh , no . No , no .

The deal was inked yesterday . We 're ... That 's right , kid . In your Hollywood debut , you will be falling in love with three-time Academy Award-winning actor Blake Huntington . Why do you care so much about those things ? I 'm guessing he already told you what he did with his . Of course I did . Mr. Huntington , we 're huge fans of your work . Huge . Like ...

And you are ? - She 's my agent . - Oh . Daniela Velázquez . But you can call me Dani . Nice to meet you . And he 's my boyfriend , Hernando Fuentes . Oh , yeah , from your , uh , São Paulo speech . You watched the speech ? I did . And when I heard you were meeting for this , I also screened The Passion of the Sinner . Really ? Yeah , I enjoyed it immensely . I thought it offered real insight on the interdependence of identity by rejecting the standard male narratives of sovereignty . I 've said the same thing . " And he judged of others by himself , not believing in what he saw , but was convinced that every man had his real , most interesting life under the cover of secrecy and the dark of night .

[ crowd silences ] I thought if you were going to vote for me ... you should know a few things about me . Once , a Kikuyu woman ... and a Luo man fell in love with each other . They were urged by both of their families not to marry outside the tribal boundary , but ... love is a bridge and not a wall , if we let it be . They became husband and wife . At first , they lived with my father 's family in Ahero , but I 'm afraid the Luo village found a hundred ways to make the new bride feel as if she was a trespasser . So , when I was only a few months old , my parents went to live in the village that my mother was born . Now it was my father 's turn to be made to feel like he was an outsider who did not belong . My parents had to leave their homes ... to find a city where no one knew them . The same prejudice that drove them away ... was also responsible for taking my father 's life when a political difference became a tribal war . I share this story because you have heard many rumors about me ... and I felt it was time to explain who and what I am . I am Kikuyu . [ cheering ] I 'm Luo . [ cheering ] My business partner and best friend is also mixed . His father , Sudanese . His mother , Kenyan . [ cheering ] These are facts that he and I have never talked about , because for us ... they have never mattered . Nothing good ever happens when people care more about our differences ... than the things we share in common . The future I hope for is the same as yours . A future where our children grow up never knowing love as a wall ... but only as a bridge . [ cheering ] [ indistinct shouting ] Please . Please . Please . Please , no violence . Please . No ! Please , stop ! Please ! Don 't do this , please ! Don 't do this ! We have to get you out of here ! Wait ! What about my family ? Your family is safer without you . Come on , let 's go !

I fucked up . And it won 't happen again . And don 't worry . He 's not gonna hurt you . How do you know that ? The safety 's on . So it is . Ah ! Why did you save me ? The last scene of The Legend of Superpower and Van Damn sure as shit don 't belong to some political bullshit plot cooked up by bossman Mandiba . But you work for him . Mandiba aren 't from Kibera like you and me . See , the thing he don 't understand about us mad fucking slumdogs ... you try to put a leash on us , we 'll rip your hands off at the wrist . Meaning , I 've got plans , Van Damn . Big plans . Now get the fuck out of my new car . Capheus ! Ohh ! It 's okay , Mama . It 's okay . - Oh , I was so scared . - It 's okay . I 'm okay . Ow ! Oh , my God . What happened ? I 'm okay . I 'm okay . What you said on that stage was good for people to hear . You were amazing . I want to grow up so I can vote for you . [ laughter ] After what happened ... I don 't think anyone 's going to vote for me . I wouldn 't be so sure , Capheus . People heard you out there . And they know the violence was caused by Mandiba 's men . He 's right . Before those demonstrators , you could feel the excitement . - It was more than just excitement . - They loved what you said . They did . And I did , too . I think everyone at the park felt the exact same thing . That there was a chance , maybe even a last chance , for a future that doesn 't look exactly like our past . Yeah . That 's true . Tonight 's the gala . Will you try to stop me ? Do you want me to stop you ? Every cop knows there are times where the only choice you have left ... is to defend yourself . I missed my cop . He missed you . Welcome home . [ applause ] The security is very perimeter-based . If Sun 's right , he gives some kind of address , we should make our move just after that . How do we get him out of the building ? Looks like the garage is our only viable exit . Got it . - We need building schematics . - On it . - And then ? - We get him to tell the truth . A coerced confession isn 't admissible evidence . We trick him . What if we can 't get him out of the building ? He 'll keep coming after her , because as long as she 's alive , someone will know what he has done . One way or another ... we end it . We take everything that matters ... we push all of it into this ... and we fight for it .

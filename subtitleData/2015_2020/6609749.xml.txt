 LUCY : Previously on Killjoys ... I thought there were only five Killjoy levels . There are . Six is an urban legend . I 'm telling you , it is a thing . You broke your oath . It 's okay to be angry , to hate me , it 's normal . Normal won 't work here . That 's why I 'm angry . D 'AVIN : You were right , John . We 're broken . JOHN " . You want to fix this ? Then you figure it out . D 'AVIN : Who 's Khlyen ? DUTCH " . He was my tutor . At the harem I grew up in . Johnny , I need you to figure out a way to track him down with this . DUTCH : What the hell is that ? A neuro-link . And what do we do when we find him ? I 'm gonna kill him . ( INDISTINCT YELLING ) D 'AVIN : You ever get the feeling it 's going to be one of those days ? Buddy . Smell that sweet Old Town air ? It 's another beautiful day in Westerley . So , why don 't we just take it down a notch ? ( YELLING ) Okay , look . It 's a disorderly warrant . Ten Joy fine , max . Hell , I 'll pay it for you . Just take a breath . Good call , thank you . Ah , you 're going with the wrench . Seriously ? ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Ah ! ALVIS : Damn it . ( GRUNTS ) Lights out . Hiding weapons , monk ? Naughty , naughty - They call it the little colonel . Carbide casing . Undetectable to weapon scanners . Peace is a dangerous business . You of all people should understand what it means to take up arms for something you believe in . I believe in what pays . My years of fighting other people 's wars are over . Besides , I 'm not even from Westerley . Your problems aren 't my problems . Keep telling yourself that , Killjoy . MAN : All you seventh-genners can kiss my ... PREE : They can kiss it outside ! Wow , what 's with all the commotion ? What isn 't ? Some fool spreading rumors . Says The Nine are going to renege on letting Westerlyns immigrate to Leith , which is fine by me . Leith takes my drunks , they take my business . Drinks are half off for the next hour in honor of Claimant Day ! ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) Sounds like business is good . That 's the third time today I 've had to take out my own trash . Room and board ain 't free , you know . I know , I know . I 'm trying . It 's just these low-level warrants have me running all over Old Town . Without a ship , I 'm stuck chasing the dregs . Being a solo Killjoy sucks ponat . Uh-uh-uh , careful , people will mistake you for a local . Oh , speaking of solo ... You got a visitor . ( SNIFFLES ) If you 're going to take a nap , I suggest the side with actual springs . Sorry . Rough night chasing down some Level 4 's on Qresh . ( CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) Speaking of rough , Pree charging extra for showers now ? Ah , I 'd laugh , but then I 'd have to inhale . ( CHUCKLING ) Why don 't we start with a peace offering ? Your stuff , from Lucy . Oh , thanks . Really . Oh , where are my manners ? Can I offer you something , um ... Hokk . DUTCH : I just want to know you 're doing better than you smell . Oh , yeah . This lone wolf ? Absolutely . I 'm a free man running wild and free . You said free twice . Well , that 's how free I be . ( HEADBOARDS THUDDING ) ( COUPLE MOANING ) How 's John ? Say hi to him for me , I guess . Yeah , sure . I will . I 'd better get going . Yeah , I got to concentrate on putting up my pillows and cushions and such . ( CHUCKLES ) It 's underwear and some weights . But raincheck on the Hokk . For real . Yeah . You know where to find me . I 'll be right here . ( CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) Just right here . ( GRUNTS ) ( CHUCKLING ) Easy , killer . Don 't patronize . I 'm still dropping my shoulder . You 're getting stronger . That makes me happy . ( GROANING AND LAUGHING ) That 's good . I know that fake warrant that I put you and D 'av through was ... Inappropriate , juvenile and almost melted our ship . Necessary . I needed to make sure that you 're okay . That you were 100 % back to you . I 'm cool . Much cooler than you , but that 's nothing new . Then I have something I 've been sitting on . Your ass ? A present . Oh , you got us a pet ? Funny . She 's funny . Her name 's Carleen . She helped me fix the neuro-link . Sorry . We can use it to track your friend . Khlyen is not my friend . Are you sure this will work ? If you 're ready , we can do this , Dutch . We can find Khlyen . Tonight . I 'm ready . ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SINGING ) Come , come , come uninvited Run , run , run Till I find you I don 't care which side That you 're fighting Gonna get you gone People have their own neuro-signatures . Brainwaves are like fingerprints . Everyone 's are different . Your friend ... Your target 's , are very unique . Extra dickish , I bet . Electrodes . Now , the last time , you both agreed to share one neuro-pathway . This time , your brainwaves will be chasing Khlyen 's . Without his permission . We have to get your brain into a fugue state . Cerebral projection requires a total immersion of both the circulatory and nervous systems . We 're going to put you in this thing . Will Khlyen be able to see me the way I saw him ? This is an experimental hack . The truth is , it 's risky . I 'll take that chance . We 'll project you as close to Khlyen 's signature as we can get . But we don 't think we 'll be able to buy you a ton of time either , so work fast . JOHN : All right . Now , if things get too real , we sever the connection and pull you out . No questions asked . You all set ? Fire it up . You 're bribing me with a book ? ( CHUCKLES ) Wow , you really do not know your audience . It 's for your brother . History of the faith . And why would he be interested in that ? We spent some time together in the black rain . He , uh ... Seemed into sacrifice . You 're a creepy little dude . ( WHISPERING ) Thank you . Since we 're talking bribes ... What you saw on the street ? It 's in everyone 's best interest if The Company doesn 't hear about the weapons . Yeah , well , lucky for you , unless there 's a warrant involved I don 't give a shit about you , The Company , or your doomed-to-fail resistance . ( CHUCKLES ) So , you 'll keep your mouth shut ? If you put enough beer in it . ( GASPS ) John , it feels wet . We 're flooding your hypothalamus with hydrogel . It mimics cerebrospinal fluid almost flawlessly . Just add it to my tab . Okay , Dutch . We 're a go . Carleen , turn on the neuro-link . This shit is freezing . CARLEEN : She 's connected . ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) Now she hunts . DUTCH : Oh , man , I feel dizzy . JOHN : Just keep talking . Describe your surroundings . Once we know where he is , we can come after him for real . I 'm in a hallway . ( STUTTERS ) A nondescript hallway . No sign of ... Whoa ! John ... I jumped . JOHN : Where are you now ? There 's a podium . It 's copper or bronze . Coated in plasma . Plasma ? Maybe some kind of computer ? Is there any security ? Is there any keypads ? Nothing , nothing . It 's glowing . No , not just glowing . It 's ... It 's moving . What do you think ? No keypad ? Bet it 's voice access only . Plasma processors . I thought they were years away . Not wherever Dutch is , apparently . ( PANTING ) This feels familiar . This is his . Khlyen 's here . He 's close . JOHN : Just a few more details on the liquid computer . Just three minutes . She doesn 't have three more minutes . I don 't like her vitals . If we pull Dutch out before she finds Khlyen , she 'll kill me . We pull her out too late , you 'll be feeding her through a tube . Okay , can you get a fix on where she 's being projected ? Deep space . Somewhere near the Quad . There are number 71s painted on the walls . JOHN : Sector 71 , maybe ? Khlyen . He 's here . ( GASPING ) That 's it , I 'm calling it . He ... He just walked past . JOHN : It 's time to disengage . No . I can do this . Dutch , where are you ? CARLEEN : Neural shock . She 's seizing ! ( GROANING ) JOHN : You 've got to get us something that we can use . ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) ( WHISPERS ) No . ( GROANING ) It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay . It 's okay . How many fingers am I holding up ? Are you okay ? I know where Khlyen is . He 's in The Rack . Khlyen was in a part of The Rack I 'd never even seen before . Level 71 . Is he their prisoner ? He had ... He had an assistant , an office . People practically bowed when he passed . Khlyen is part of The Rack , John . What if he was part of it this whole time ? What if I never really escaped ? Well , then , let 's finally set you free . No matter what it takes ? I 'll clear my schedule . ( CHUCKLES ) The bad news is The Rack is in the most heavily fortified station in the Quad . Yeah , but the good news is our badges get us in the front door . So , covert op ? JOHN : Level 40 through 54 . We get positioned thereabouts , and then ... Then I could shimmy through these ventilation ducts . Exposing you to enough radiation to melt your face off . You 're right . You should do it . D 'AVIN : ( CLEARING THROAT ) Fresh soldiers ? Thought you could use them . You look intense . Those look intense . It 's a Level 3 Leith job . We 've got this , D 'Av . Right . None of my business . Sorry , force of habit . He could help , Johnny . He 's great at tactical . Yeah , sure , I 'm willing to give it a shot . Bellus dug deep to get us blueprints of The Rack . The Rack ? What 's the warrant ? No warrant . But a long time coming . Khlyen . You found him ? Turns out he never left . We rerouted his neuro-link to track him . He 's stationed at the top of HQ . He 's in The Rack ? Our Rack ? Floor 71 . Upper levels are officers only . Officers who work interstellar . Setting up satellite offices around the The " J " and introducing The Rack to places that need order . When you confront Khlyen , how are you going to ... How are you going to kill him ? I 'm not sure I can . But now ? This is bigger than killing . I need answers . What if he doesn 't like your questions ? How are you going to force an answer ? Dutch , what 's your leverage ? We hadn 't gotten to that part yet . I 've had 20 years to get to that part . I 've got it . And a sudden craving for something stronger than beer . Johnny , that is a lot of security doors on automatic lockdown . You sure this is going to work ? It has to . Dutch needs it . I need to orchestrate a reason for us to get higher point-of-entry privileges to The Rack than usual . Well , um , good luck . ( GLASSES CLINK ) You , too . About your cause ... Yes ? I got one of my own . I figure we can help each other out . KHLYEN : Do not eat that , child . That smell , like almonds ? It means the flesh has fermented into a deadly toxin . A single bite could make you sick for days . YOUNG DUTCH : The other girls keep taking my food . ( EXHALES ) You are Yalena , of the family Yardeen . The others say it 's a shameful name . Yes , they are cruel to you . Perhaps you can change that . Restore Yardeeni honor . Your father is counting on it . He sent me to find you , little bird . To train you and protect you . It won 't be easy . And you have to keep it a secret . No matter what hate they spew at you . No matter what punishment . The truth is ... You 're special , Yala . Now ... Do you know the story of the Wasp and the Bear ? JOHN : Are you okay ? Yeah . I think I 'm having aftershocks from that neuro-link . Visions ? Nightmares ? Just a memory about Khlyen . Nice one , actually . I didn 't think you had any of those . Guess I 've only ever told you the bad stuff . So , what 's the good stuff ? He 's always protected me . There was a time when he gave me hope when I needed it the most . Better or worse , he 's made me who I am . Bullshit . ( SCOFFS ) Six years ago , I came in that door for the first time to steal the prettiest ship that I 'd ever seen . And instead , I found a half-feral beauty in a wedding dress , covered in blood , with a gun pointed at my crotch . Um , your head , if I recall . Well , you recall wrong . My crotch remembers . But after all this time , you 're still more your own person than anyone that I know . The only credit that Khlyen gets is for the bruises along the way . Thanks . I don 't think this is side effects . I think it 's cold feet . I guess killing your surrogate father is no small thing . If you want to fight , I got your back . If you want to run , I call shotgun . But you 've got to decide , Yalena . Say it one more time . What ? What you told me the night we first met . We don 't have to stay here . We can just fly away and never look back . Not this time . I 'm going to face him , Johnny . ( CHUCKLES ) I know . JOHN : Lucy ? LUCY : Apologies , he still has authorization . D 'AVIN : Just me , Johnny . ( SIGHS ) I 'm glad you 're both up . Couldn 't sleep . D 'AVIN : Yeah , me neither . I know how to get you to the top of The Rack . D 'AVIN : So , that 's Arkyn . Looks like a good place to hide out . I mean , if this goes to hell . It won 't , and it 's not . That moon was The Company 's first foray into terraforming before Westerley . Didn 't do great . Rack central , 12 : 00 . OFFICER : Call signs , security clearance , reason for entry ? Call sign U-gamma-4471-B . Level 3 , 4 and 5 Reclamation Agents John Jaqobis , D 'avin Jaqobis and Dutch . Reason for entry ? Guys , it 's just a formality , anyway . Hey . Your reason for entry ? ( BEEPING ) We 've come to file for divorce . To dissolve our team . You are clear for docking in bay 35 . Welcome back , agents . That 's not bad . I thought we 'd be down in the teens . Yeah , but Khlyen 's on 71 . How you going to clear 40 levels ? One floor at a time . COMPUTER : Registered agent weapons logged and approved . ( BUZZING ) That 's new . Warning . Internal scan . Foreign object detected . Oh , right , the surgery . Titanium stitches . And yeah , it really , really hurt . Re-scan . Titanium traces detected . Approved . DUTCH : So , we 're here to terminate our affiliation with D 'avin Jaqobis . JOHN : We no longer intend to Killjoy as a trio . OFFICIAL : Fine . I will remove your sponsorship , dissolve the team . So say you all ? Aye . Aye . Aye . TURIN : I have some questions . Team Awesome Force breaking up ? Must be one hell of a story . It drags a bit in the middle . I 'll take it from here . Officer Turin , call sign F-kilo-946-R , now recording these proceedings . I have reason to suspect the recent actions of these agents . Well , I can think of a reason . You 're an ... Let the record show , this is now an inquiry into a possible suspension of your reclamation licenses . Well , this is a good day . D 'avin back yet ? PREE : Still gone . As should you be . Hills has his men combing the streets . They 're rounding up monks . Over a few missing guns ? Hills and I have an agreement . Had an agreement . Take the tunnels . Have faith . The roots will carry us . Why not file a split with your broker ? Why come all this way ? Well , we heard there was a new chef in the caf , so ... TURIN : You think this is funny , son ? D 'AVIN : Actually , I do think it 's a joke . If you had anything incriminating on these agents , you would have arrested them the second they stepped onto the station , sir . He 's bossy . I like him . So , why don 't you ? It didn 't work out . Did you sleep with him ? Hey . Yes . TURIN : ( CHUCKLES ) And that made the jilted Jaqobis mad . You 're such a piece of work . I 'm the one who screwed up . I 'm the one they 're here to report on . Do shut up , Bossy . Because I beat her , then stabbed him . TURIN : You attacked your own team ? The Rack takes assault on its own very seriously . Then I want to speak to a rep . But first , I want to know that this break-up is official . I want nothing to do with these assholes . They ruined my goddamn life . Like I said , I knew I liked him . There . You 're done as a team . And when I 'm done with you , probably as a Killjoy . But I 'll fetch your rep , for appearances ' sake . Try not to shiv anyone while I 'm gone . What the hell are you doing ? Come on . We don 't have much time . For what , D 'av ? D 'AVIN : Getting you to floor 71 . Here . Ear pieces that run on plathium . When this goes down ... When what goes down ? ... your comlinks won 't work , thanks to little colonel . ( RAPID BEEPING ) DUTCH : YO , what the hell ? Anyone else think that would be cooler ? ( POWERING DOWN ) Did you just power fry the entire Rack ? D 'AVIN : Little bit . Targeted pulse charge . Emergency lights and life support should be fine . Do you know what you 've done ? Bought you a few more floors and better luck with those now-unlocked security doors . D 'av . Look , I couldn 't tell you what I had planned . The charge is undetectable , but if they link it to me , I can say I acted alone . Because I did . You finally lost your damn mind . Look , I get that you want to end Khlyen more than anything . But just take care of my little brother . Nobody 's getting hurt but Khlyen . Go be a hero . NAJIK : Sir . Ah , Najik . Some tea , please . I think we 're having company . OFFICIAL : What are they saying upstairs ? Surge ? Meteor shower ? Screw upstairs . I know exactly who caused this . A big dumb guy , a smaller dumb guy and a bitch . We 've just got to find them . Contraband , please ? Ah ! Ta . Okay , so , what 's in the syringe ? A gift . Got your lenses in ? Uh-huh . Remember what we 're here for . And you remember that other than Khlyen , these are our people . They 're not our enemies . We can 't just shoot our way out if things go wrong . If they bust us , no more license . No more Killjoying . You asking me not to do this ? I 'm asking you to be awesome . ( CHUCKLES ) Always am . COMPUTER : Attention . Technical issues being addressed . Power will be restored by ascending levels . WOMAN : Wilson said there 's a fire on Level 50. is that true ? Damn it . No idea . Power restored to Level 1 . JOHN : D ' av , are you there ' ? Yeah . What 's the word ? After that baller move you made , I figure we at least owe you a ride home . Get your ass to Lucy . We 'll meet you there as soon as we 're done with Khlyen . You got it , buddy . Halfway there . Talk soon . So . What 's with the mood lighting ? You guys forget to pay the bill ? ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( GROANING ) Upside of no power ? No security recordings . COMPUTER : Power restored to Level 5 . DUTCH : Just how big is this thing ? You 'd think I 'd get sick of people asking me that . Concentrate , Captain Comet . I 'm on Level 52 . I need to get higher , faster . How do you feel about catwalks ? Meow . COMPUTER : Power restored to Level 8 . Starboard corridor , if I memorized the blueprints right . DUTCH " . You know you did . Oh , good . Lucky the power 's out . COMPUTER : Power restored to Level 15 . Power restored to Level 25 . What do you want , Turin ? What I 'm owed . Answers . I had nothing to do with the power outage . Sure you did , but I don 't give a shit about that . ( CHUCKLES ) What 's your little girlfriend got planned ? Who is Dutch really ? What makes her so special ? Have you seen her eyes ? ( GROANS ) ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) Do you know that she started at Level 5 ? First time on record . All complaints against her get rerouted off-site and disappeared . I just want to know who 's protecting her . Dutch doesn 't need protecting . Then why is she marked for Red 17 ? What did you say ? I 'm not the enemy here , son . Hell , I may be the only real friend Dutch has in this place . So , you got five seconds to tell me what I need to know . ( DUTCH PANTING ) John , I 'm here . On Khlyen 's floor . Are you in range yet ? John ? ( GASPING ) KHLYEN : Terrible . Show me what you remember , Yala . I 'm not here to fight you . Then you 're here to lose . JOHN : Dutch . If you can hear me , I 'm in . I 'm within communications range . I can hear you and him . I 'm just calibrating now , so keep him talking . ( TRILLING ) KHLYEN : I 'd always hoped you 'd drop by . ( IN KHLYEN 'S VOICE ) I 'm Khlyen , the evil ass-clown . Good to go . ( GRUNTING ) Disappointing . So , so disappointing . ( GRUNTS ) Better . But not good enough . Tea ? What the hell is Red 17 ? Why are you asking me ? ( SCOFFS ) You got nothing . I got a stick that goes zap . Yeah , and a fine set of hair . After that , you 've just got rumors and theories . Sad . Well , it was worth a shot . COMPUTER : Power restored to Level 35 . There goes your window . Whatever the hell Dutch is up to , she 's about to get caught . Do you know what this is ? Fermented calyptum . I can smell the almonds from here . I didn 't take you for nostalgic . This is how you made me kill second-matron . I was 10 years old . I watched her die . I remember . I was proud . Torsin Deck . He was always kind to me . He cried when I twisted the knife . Patela , the cleric 's girl ? I gave her the wrong poison . She screamed for six days . Yes , well , each death was a lesson . The only lesson you ever taught me was how to hate myself . Do you really think you can make it to me with that needle ? It 's not for you . Yala . Back . I have been racking my brain every day since I left you , trying to figure out your weakness . Until I realized ... It 's me . Isn 't it ? Put down the needle . Shut up . This is what it feels like . I want you to know what it feels like to not be in control . Was it wrong of me to protect you all these years ? You changed me . Exactly . They were making you a victim . I made you a weapon . Now , you tell me I was wrong , Yala . I 'm asking the questions . Enough playing - I will not answer under false blackmail . Then let 's make this real . Damn it . JOHN : Come to Daddy . There 's no screen . Ferromagnetic maybe . I 'm going to touch it . ( GASPING ) Carleen was right . It 's a computer . JOHN : Computer , search keyword " Khlyen . " Don 't , blink , Jaqobis . Don 't blink . Computer , transfer files to PDD . A little for Carleen and a lot for me . Shit . Shitty shit stupid shit . Johnny , what did you do ? I don 't know , but I can 't undo it . Get to Lucy ASAP . Our exit plan just got a lot more complicated . COMPUTER : Breach detected . Lockdown protocol . ( GRUNTING ) All docking bays shut down until future approval . What have you done ? John has the antidote . If I don 't go to him soon , I 'll be past saving . And I 'm not leaving here until you tell me everything I want to know . Why are you here in The Rack ? You don 't even know what The Rack really is , Yala . You 're asking the wrong questions . Were you always a part of it ? Even in my world ? Yes . Was ... Was that what you were training me for ? Yes . Why come back now ? Why ? Why now ? You took a Level 5 warrant . A kill job . That was the sign I 'd been waiting for . That you were finished running . That you were ready . Ask the real question , Yala . Why me ? ( DOOR OPENS ) Ah ! Are you all right , sir ? Officers only . I ... What was really in the needle ? Millweed for the scent , adrenaline for the heart rate . Well done , little bird . Very convincing . It would be a shame to come all the way up here and not take the shot . Answer the question . Take the shot . That 's not how I 'm going to destroy you . I 'm fine . It 's fine . Was that her ? Just clean it up . Clean it up ! ( ALARM BLARING ) JOHN : D 'avin . John . I think it 's time to leave . I think you 're right , little brother . COMPUTER : Breach detected . D 'AVIN : How long before they know it was us ? JOHN : We get out of here before the security feeds come back online , they 'll never know . ( SIGHS ) Let 's hope Dutch is already onboard . COMPUTER : All docking bays shut down until future approval . Lucy , instigate reboot protocol . Critical systems only . LUCY : John , I cannot disengage while The Rack is in lockdown . Balls . I 'll do it . DUTCH : No , Jaqobis . I will . Dutch ? Get back here now . I can 't . Someone needs to stay behind to free Lucy . Just go . ( BEEPING ) What is she doing ? You leave now , there 's no proof you were involved in any of this . You can still be a Killjoy . Hey , idiot . I only want to Killjoy with you . Get to the Royale . I 'll make my own way home . Lucy , throttle down . Now ! LUCY : I 'm sorry , John , Dutch has instituted a master code . I told you , stop bossing my ship around . Initiate protocol . Freebird . Initiating Freebird . No ! Be safe . TURIN : I think your free ride 's just about up . Oh , give it up , Turin . We both know ... ( GROANING ) Look at that . What the hell are you doing ? Are you crazy ? You ever go hunting for parson , out in the badlands ? Sneaky little things . But if you manage to catch one , you break its wings , throw it out onto the sands , and watch all his little friends come running . I 'm not bait , I 'm an agent . We 're on the same side . See , that 's just the thing . I 'm not so sure we are . KHLYEN : We 're not . DUTCH : Where am I ? KHLYEN : Safe . Time to get you home , and for me to fix your mess . DUTCH : John and D 'avin ? Will suffer no repercussions for this foolish infiltration . You 'll need your full team with what 's coming . Keep that tourniquet tight . You 've lost a lot of blood . DUTCH : Why do you keep protecting me ? ( INHALING SHARPLY ) ( SHUSHING ) Do you remember the first time I tucked you in ? I told you a story . The Wasp and the Bear . Mmm-hmm . And the moral of that story ? In the end , they save one another . I need you to live . Was any of it true ? Did my father really send you ? What are you ? I 'm Level 6 . I 'm looking for Alvis Akari . Resistance and disobedience are punishable offenses under The Company directive , but you people don 't seem to be getting the message . Maybe the problem isn 't the message , but the method in which it 's being delivered . Alvis . I didn 't think you 'd make it this easy . To talk ? We can always talk , Hills . About sadness , Joy ... No amount of Joy is going to get you out of this one . Alvis Akari , you are under arrest ... You really want to light this match now , boots ? ... for orchestrating the Leith Bazaar massacre . What massacre ? Hills , you know me . I don 't know anything anymore . Hills , don 't be an idiot . Shut him up . Even if you have to remove his tongue to do it . Hills . ( GROANING ) ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) I don 't know why . D 'AVIN : What the hell is going on out there ? And where is Dutch ? It 's been four hours . And I can 't decrypt any of Khlyen 's intel . I hope this was worth it . ( DOOR CREAKING OPEN ) Dutch . Holy hell . ( PANTING AND GROANING ) Pawter . We need Pawter . How much blood have you lost ? Khlyen is Level 6 . What ? He told me . Dutch , he 's lying . Level 6 Killjoys are a myth . DUTCH : So , why do I believe him ? He 's still messing with your head . Look , Dutch , I know a thing or two about bad dads . And if I ever get a chance , I will repay him for everything that he has done to you . How many breakups do we need to go through before you learn ? I don 't need you to fight my battles . Doesn 't mean I don 't want to . Then you better hurry . Whatever his plan is , I think he 's just getting started . I know what you are . I know what you do up there . Really ? ( GROANS ) Let 's chat about that , shall we ?

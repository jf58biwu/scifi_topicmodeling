 [ birds chirping ] [ water rushing ] [ birds chirping ] I 'm glad you 're here , ethan . Have you , uh , spoken to anyone else about what happened ? Talked to my partner . Do you find it helpful to talk to him ? Her . [ pen clicks ] She 's been really supportive . Good . What about your wife ? Have you talked to your wife about it ? I wish i could , but ... Some things are classified and ... So the person who 's supposed to be closest to you Doesn 't know what you 're going through . [ sighs ] Ethan ... If someone is to blame for the easter bombings , It 's whoever signed those release papers , Not you . You had no choice . You were following orders . I was watching the guy , I knew he was dirty , and i let him go . That 's on me . Have you been experiencing Any more hallucinations ? No . I mean , i 've had a few nightmares here and there , But nothing like what i was experiencing before . Really ? What do you mean by " hallucinations " ? [ echoing ] people or objects that aren 't really there . [ door bell jingles ] [ dishes clinking lightly ] Are you okay ? Where am i ? You 're in wayward pines , idaho . Idaho ?

I know you had a concussion and a few cracked ribs . Could have been much worse . Apparently it was a nasty car accident . [ sighs ] Stallings : Does your wife know that one of the missing agents You 're looking for is kate hewson ? Ethan : Why open up old wounds ? Anyway , it 's classified . Well , it seems kind of strange That hassler would choose you for this one . What happened between kate and i , it 's over . Okay ? But she was my partner . And that means something . You expect me to believe that if you - - Nurse pam : [ chuckles ] A-plus for you . I 'm nurse pam , by the way , and you are ? I 'm ethan burke . Correct .

The other guy that was in the car with me . I 'm afraid he didn 't make it . No . Was he a close friend of yours ? [ sighs ] i need to call my wife . Oh , i believe the sheriff 's department got in touch With your emergency contacts after the accident . [ sighs ] Where 's my phone and the rest of my things ? Oh , we don 't have anything of yours . But i can certainly put on my nancy drew detective hat And check into that for you . I bet the sheriff 's office has everything . See this little black button ? I 'm just one click away . [ chuckles ] [ siren wails in distance ] I want whatever 's left of the car transferred here . We 're taking over the investigation . I can 't believe they waited a day and a half to call us . The body was so badly burned , It took them two whole days to figure out who stallings was . All right , but why was he the only one in the car ? He 's with ethan burke . Well , maybe he wasn 't with ethan burke . Yeah , but ethan checked in by e-mail At 1 : 21 p.M. From lowman , idaho , where they stopped for gas . J-jimmy , anything could have happened Between lowman and the ball of fire By the side of the road 20 miles later , okay ? Just take it easy .

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Hello , Skye . I 'm Gordon . I 'll take you to a place where you can be with people like us . You can learn about your gift . We founded the real S.H.I.E.L.D. On the belief that leadership should operate with transparency . Coulson and his secrets , that 's the threat . And I think it 's time that we remove that threat . This should get you by for a few days . Without you , there is no S.H.I.E.L.D. They know about Skye . Find her . Gordon , help . Can I let you in on a little secret ? I 've got a genuine , honest Abe , God-given superpower . You want to know what it is ? I 'm afraid to guess . I can look at any man and tell him exactly what kind of car he should be driving . Maybe I 'll just look around . Y-you know , I look at you , and I see a man who 's played it safe his whole life , but lately feels like he 's stuck in a rut . Life 's lost its thrill . The kids are monsters . The wife 's taken to muumuus . And now you 're thinking , " it 's time to let the tiger loose . " Am I hitting the Mark ? Amazing . Then this is the car for you . Actually , I 'm interested in this S.U.V. I 'm going off-roading . I need something that can take a beating . I 'll pay you cash right now . A man with cash is a man with class . I 'll do you one better ... 2010 4-wheel drive Wrangler Rubicon ... came in . A bit pricier , but she 's a beaut . It 's ... well , it looks like this one here . - Get in . - What are you doing ? Put that back . I 'm making a deal . For that piece of junk ? This is my vehicle . You know , I need you to get out of there right now . We 're not criminals . We don 't want to draw any more attention . If it makes you feel better , you can send him a check . Oh , wait . No , we can 't , because our bank accounts have been frozen . So just get in . I 'll get you to Skye , I promise . Hold on a second . You two are in cahoots ? You know what ? I-I 'm gonna call the police . See what you did ? He 's calling the police . Are you happy ? Sorry , Eddie . The tiger 's been loose for awhile . Hey . Everything 's gonna be okay . You 're safe now . Gordon , where am I ? This is the place I told you about . You called for me . Do you remember ? How long have I been here ? Two days . T-t ... I need to ... I need to go . They need me . Something bad has happened . Oh , why can 't I move ? What are you doing to me ? We 're healing you . Leaving now wouldn 't exactly be ... You ever made microwave popcorn ? Leave it in too long , and it 's charcoal . Take it out too soon , and it 's a bag of kernels . That might be the worst analogy ever . Gordo , help me out here . You are on your own with this one . I have to go now . You 're in very good hands . He 's smarter than he looks . How do you know that ? He 's been by your side since the moment you got here . Who are you ? Sorry . I thought ... I 'm Lincoln , your transitioner . Right . I-I keep forgetting you 're new to this . E-everyone who goes through terrigenesis has , uh , a transitioner to help them . Please cut to the chase . I ... Right , yeah . Let me start from the top . Imagine a thousand years of evolution taking place instantaneously . T-that 's what happened to you after the mist . These treatments ... we 're helping your body adjust properly to the change , transitioning you quickly and painlessly , I hope . We usually like to start the process - right after the mist , but as ... - How long ? How long ? When can I go ? You got places to be , people to see ? I 'm worried about my friends . I think they 're in danger . You 're the one that 's in danger , Skye . Remember ? You 're being hunted . Seven agents down , Calderon barely hanging on , and you want to defend that thing ? She 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent , not a thing . What happened wasn 't her fault . I was there . Calderon fired at her . She was armed and hostile . She was scared and defending herself . I don 't care if she was chasing butterflies . We can 't wear kid gloves around something with powers of that magnitude . - She could have killed everyone . - But she didn 't . Only because that other freak pulled her from the fight . Was he one of Coulson 's ? We 've only recently encountered him . Coulson 's as in the dark as we are . Are you certain about that ? If Coulson 's collecting powered people , we need to know before they come knocking on our door . No one wants a war , Barbara . That 's not gonna happen . Coulson 's reasonable . Then we need to get into that box to know for sure . Well , then you need Fitz . Pure vibranium shell ... no ports , no external power source . How do you get inside to retrieve the data ? I suspect advanced biometric access points . Probably loaded with self-destruct triggers . Yeah . Leo Fitz , Jemma Simmons , the ones that got away . I had my eye on you two when you were at the academy . I wanted to recruit you , but Coulson beat me to it . I heard he actually bribed Weaver with cupcakes . Robert Gonzales . We know who you are , and we are quite aware of your commendable reputation . Under different circumstances , we might even be flattered ... Which is why this is so hard to comprehend . Under different circumstances , we would have preferred to be invited guests , but that forced our hand . We had to take it out of play . What 's inside that 's so important ? All we know is that Coulson and Fury both believed it was valuable enough or dangerous enough to protect with extreme measures . Maybe it was their favorite recipes . Maybe it is . Then , maybe , we can put all this behind us and move on . That 's why I 'm asking you for your help , Leo . And if he refuses , will you lock him up , like you did Agent May ? There are no prisoners here . We are all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . Exit protocols have not changed . Once you 're cleared and debriefed , you 're free to go , if that 's what you really want . Okay . I 'll start packing my things . You should have brought cupcakes . Well ... You have to admire their loyalty . Loyalty to a man and not to S.H.I.E.L.D. That makes Coulson as dangerous as whatever 's in that box . What the hell happened here ? Skye . Did they do this to her , or did she do it to them ? One way to find out . My God . Skye 's doing that ? Glad she 's on our side . She 's still on our side , isn 't she ? This isn 't good . Well , at least they didn 't take her . That means she 's out there , so we 'll find her and ... that 's new . Did she just get abducted by aliens ? What the hell was that ? We don 't know what he is . He took Skye 's father and Raina . Seriously ? I was only gone a week . We don 't know where he comes from , where he goes , or who he works for . He doesn 't leave trails or clues . I lost her . How are you feeling ? Kind of normal . - Normal 's good . - Yeah . We flushed your lymphatic and circulatory systems , so you 'll be weak for a few days , but ... I need to give a message to my friends . Gordon 's the only one who can make contact with the outside world . We can talk to him when he gets back . Where exactly are we ? No one really knows . Uh , the official name is Chinese , I think ... Lai Shi ... doesn 't exactly translate . So we just call it " Afterlife . " You say the name of this place is Chinese . - Are we in China ? - No idea . Gordon 's the only one who knows where we are , and he 's the only way in or out . It keeps us secret and safe from the outside world . Or it keeps us prisoners . You 're not very trusting , are you ? I woke up naked on a table in a place no one can even point to on a map , so ... Call me crazy . You weren 't totally naked , and you asked Gordon to bring you here . No one 's gonna force you to stay . It 's not a bad place . The night life 's a little lacking . So you live here ? No one lives here , not permanently . It 's more like a way station . I 'm from Cincinnati , trying to finish Med School . I 'm brought here when I 'm needed . Some people come here when they need a safe place to stay . Why do I feel like the new kid in school right now ? Everyone is staring at me . Gordon didn 't explain ? No , I thought you said that everyone here is like me and that this happens all the ... Time . Are you kidding ? T-this has never happened . Things here have always been done a certain way . These people are descendants , yes , but most of them are waiting to be chosen . They carry the genetic marker and have been brought here to be evaluated , cultured , and prepared for the change should they be selected , but that only happens to one person every few years . They actually want to go through ? This tradition has been passed down through countless generations . And I jumped the line . And not only did you go through without permission or prep , but you did it old-school , with a diviner in a kree temple . Uh , that hasn 't happened for thousands of years . You can see why some of these people might be a little envious . I 'd gladly change places with any of them . I didn 't want this . I understand . Uh , the woman who changed with me , Raina ... Gordon took her and my father . Are they here ? Gordon takes people everywhere . It 's his job to keep us safe . I promise , there is no one here who will harm you . You 're protected . Is it true that Fury asked you to spy on Coulson because of these GH-325 transfusions ? Is it also true that Coulson himself asked you to put a bullet in his head because of it ? That 's the man that you helped escape , a man that Fury didn 't trust , a man that you yourself didn 't trust , a man that didn 't even trust himself . There 's loyalty , and there 's stubbornness . Tell me , Agent May ... Are you loyal to Coulson or to S.H.I.E.L.D. ? They 're the same . Coulson 's powered pet tried to kill seven of our agents ... Dedicated S.H.I.E.L.D. agents with families , and you 're gonna say that they 're the same ? Coulson had nothing to do with Skye 's powers . They were caused by a weapon in Hydra 's possession . That you were chasing because of some voices in Coulson 's head . We were pursuing Hydra because that 's our job . It 's what we should all be doing right now instead of wasting our time on some witch hunt ! What are you doing in here by yourself ? There 's too much bad blood out there . They think we 're traitors . How you holding up ? Uh ... We always knew this wasn 't gonna end in a big group hug . Coulson 's a good man , Mack . Yeah . He 's a good man who 's been compromised . Coulson should be in the index with Agent Skye . You of all people know what happens when powered people lose control . You had to put one down . Isn 't that why they call you the Cavalry ? So you want to put down Coulson and Skye ? I want to avoid it . His actions are leading us to a deadly showdown . Help me find him , and we 'll stop it . Don 't worry . When he 's ready , he 'll find you . Coulson is the one man ... You can never put down . You always travel with whiskey and shot glasses ? Never know when you 're gonna need something to keep you warm on a cold night . - Two glasses ? - The other one 's for the person keeping me warm . Mm . But in your case , I 'll make an exception . I need to keep my head clear . S.H.I.E.L.D. and Skye gone in one day ... how could I let that happen ? There 's no way you could have known . They fooled all of us . Bobbi and Mack are conniving liars and thieves . And the next time I see either of them ... They 're good agents . Try to see it from their side . Screw their side . There are very few people in this world that I 'd throw down with , but you 're one of them . Gonzales , the " Love Boat " Captain ? Not if hell froze over . He 's a brilliant tactician who 's dedicated his life to S.H.I.E.L.D. I ran into him a couple of times at the Triskelion . He 's not a bad guy . Good guys don 't usually stab you in the back . Maybe he 's got a point . I was dead , after all . I shouldn 't even be here . We all have our bad days . Well , maybe we should forget all this , head down to Mexico . We can lay low , enjoy the quiet life . That 's not an option . The problem is , there are no good options . Well , maybe it 's time for the bad ones . Are you really going to let Fitz just walk out of here ? He 's already cleared and free to go . What about you ? Are you staying ? I keep hoping this will all be resolved and things can get back to normal . The fastest way to make that happen is to help us open that box . Aren 't you curious what 's inside ? Of course I am , but not enough to betray Coulson . If he isn 't hiding something , then opening it will prove that . If he is ... Don 't you think we should know ? Once it 's opened , you 'll all leave ? Once we know we 're all on the same side . But we need Fitz to get it open . Not really . You 've been looking at it all wrong . It 's not a tech solution , it 's a lab solution . Well , this is yours for as long as you want . Gordon brought your bag from the cabin , so , you know , take some time , try to relax . Relax ? This will be like my fourth bed in the past week , and I 've been locked up , quarantined , psychoanalyzed . Let me guess . To protect you from yourself . The inhibitors these released seriously compromised the transition process . It 's one of the reasons , uh , you were out for so long . My friend ... she was just ... trying to help . I mean , she thought she was dealing with human biology , but you graduated from that class . I 'm gonna take a closer look at these . Uh , meanwhile , try to get some rest . Tomorrow , maybe we 'll see what gift you 've been given . It 's more like a curse . A lot of us feel that way at first , but you 'll learn to control it . I don 't want to control it , I want to get rid of it . That 's ... why I called Gordon . I thought that he 'd be able to fix me . I 'm sorry . I-I thought you knew . The transition is irreversible . You 'll feel better in a few days ... trust me . At least , hang here until things calm down on the outside . See what happens . Plus , it 's , uh , pizza night tomorrow night . Deep dish ... Gordon brings them in from Chicago . Uh , you can 't miss it . Nice to see his gifts aren 't being wasted . Seriously , rest . I 'll see you in the morning . What 's happening ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s here . - Ours or theirs ? - Theirs . Damn it . How did they find us ? I invited them . Why did you trigger the alarm ? Are you surrendering ? Last time I checked , there were two of us , which means two votes . - We 're not surrendering . - What , then ? You want to go out guns blazing , like Butch and Sundance ? That didn 't end so well . I was thinking about what you said last night , about bad options . I meant have another drink . I 'm not going down without a fight . We 're gonna find Skye and I 'm gonna take back S.H.I.E.L.D. , and we 're gonna need more than honest Eddie 's jeep to do it . You want to take their quinjet ... the two us , while we 're trapped in here , surrounded ? - Brilliant . - I have reinforcements on the way . We just have to hold down the fort until they get here . Yeah , well , I have reinforcements of my own . Icers only . Oh , you can 't be serious . Those are S.H.I.E.L.D. agents out there . We 're not gonna hurt them . I somehow doubt they feel the same about us . It won 't come to that . It may not look like it , but this place was built to withstand a hulk-size force . On the other hand , let 's just hope they didn 't bring a battering ram , 'cause then we 've only got about an hour . Confirmed , sir , Coulson is inside . It 'll take some time to break through that door , but he 's not going anywhere . Let me know when it 's done . Yes sir . Any more good news ? Agent Simmons may be on board , but I came to talk to you about Agent May . - I think your approach ... - It 's irrelevant . We got Coulson at the safe house where we found Skye . He triggered the alarm . That wasn 't an accident . Coulson 's too smart for that . He sent for us . The question is why . Where are we going ? You 'll see . What 's over there ? Oh , another transition room . We don 't use it anymore . Come on . Keep up . This is it ... best view in the house . It 's beautiful . Good place to clear your head , figure things out , smoke a little something . But today , we 're here to figure out you . Tell me about your gift . Is that why you brought me up here ? Yeah , so you can let loose . Whatever it is , you don 't have to be afraid of it . We were designed to be weapons . I got that directly from the big blue source . Take my hand . I know it 's so awkward , but you strike me as someone who 's generally more curious than afraid . Whoa . Are you doing that ? When I came out of the mist , every cell in my body had a different electrical charge . I felt like I was burning from the inside out . But I learned to manipulate them , concentrate them , even transfer them onto something else , like static electricity . I can feel it moving through my body . It 's so weird . It took awhile to get control . Uh , when I first got here , I almost burned the place down , literally . But now ... sky 's the limit . No pun intended , I guess . This is crazy . Our gifts don 't have to be terrifying . They 're a part of us . I felt lost before I came here , too . Looking for answers in the all the wrong places . But we 're connected to something bigger and older than ... than we could have ever imagined , something extraordinary . Don 't walk away from it . I hate to see you leave , Turbo . Only my friend Mack calls me that . I 'll always be your friend , Fitz . Hopefully , someday , you 'll understand why I had to do what I did . If you 're here to convince me to open the box , you 're wasting ... No , I 'm here because I don 't want you to leave , man . I believe in what we 're doing . I want you on board . I mean , the damn box is taken care of . What do you mean , it 's taken care of ? Well , Simmons , uh , she found a way in using ... Genetic markers or something . If she can see we 're on the same team , why can 't you ? She 's scanning the surface dimensions and routing the data through ... Why would she do that , unless ... It 's just a matter of time before she breaks through , and this will all be over . How much time ? About three minutes . Where are the reinforcements ? I don 't know . Stuck in traffic ? Are they traveling by clown car ? How many are there ? Actually , there 's one . One ? That 's not reinforcements , that 's a gravedigger . Well , there 's not many agents I can trust right now . One ? Have you lost your bloody mind ? What is that ? It 's a 21st-century howling commandos kit . Trip and Fitz built it for me . Hey , do you play cards ? I can 't believe that worked . We had the better hand . How many of us are there ? We don 't know . Not every descendant is found , and not everyone who is chooses to come . - Mm . - Gordon ! I hope we 're still on for pizza tonight . Truthfully , I think that 's what sold her . Not tonight . I have to see to some pressing matters , but I 'm glad you 're feeling better , Skye . I need you to give a message to my friends , let them know I 'm okay . I can ask permission , but they 'll advise against it . It 's better we stay quiet for the time being . Uh ... Wait . My father and Raina ... where did you take them ? I can 't divulge their location , just as I can 't divulge yours . But you don 't need to worry about them . What does he mean , " ask permission " ? - Ask permission from who ? - The Elders . You 've made a lot of people afraid , Skye ... afraid our secret won 't be safe for much longer . Come on . Where have you been ? ! After all I 've done , this is how you treat me ... locking me up , feeding me like some animal ? ! I can 't have a ... a window ? ! I don 't even know what day it is anymore ! You 're lucky we 've kept you alive . Ohh . You found her , didn 't you ? That 's why you 're here . You found her , and she 's here . Okay . Uh , I forgive you . You must have had your reasons . Now take me to my Daisy . You will not ! I want my daughter ! Don 't you leave me ! No ! Where are you ? ! Huh ? Ohh . This is silly . You clearly have an unfair advantage , and we clearly don 't see eye to eye . So , let 's just ... just take a moment and ... Aah ! Aah ! Aah . Why ? Why can 't I see her ? Because you have no self-control . Your lack of discipline has risked everything that we have built . You have not only sealed your fate , but the fate of your daughter , as well . This would have been a piece of cake if you 'd let us use these big-boy guns . Now we have to get close enough to get shot by their big-boy guns . By the time they recognize us , it 'll be too late . Then there 's the small matter of who 's gonna fly that thing ... do you even know how ? I 've watched May fly . - I know a little . - How little ? I can get us off the ground . You do know there 's more to it than that ... like , getting us back on the ground , for example ? Now we just walk right up and ... Drop your weapons and put your hands in the air . We have you surrounded . We 're not surrounded . Don 't move . Your hands up now . Didn 't see that coming . How 's it going ? Uh , well , I 'm making progress , but it 's going to take some time . There are microscopic pores in the vibranium that I believe are calibrated to Coulson 's DNA . It 's constantly shifting like a Rubik 's cube . But if I can isolate them , then there 's ... I saw everything , Jemma . Did you really want me to find out this way ? Well ... well , I was hoping you would so that we can work together on this . Do you have any idea how valuable the information inside this could be ? You need to help me get it out , get things back to normal . Things can never go back to normal . Can 't you see that ? Can 't any of you see what you 've done ? You 've destroyed a man 's life , and for what ? Fitz , put it down right now . 'Cause of fear , ' cause of fear of what 's inside a little black box . Well , I don 't believe in fear . I believe in trust , and I 'm shocked that you would do this . You knew this would drive me away . You may as well have packed my bags yourself . You want me to leave , don 't you , Jemma ? If we work for S.H.I.E.L.D. , we have a duty to carry out our responsibilities . So perhaps it 's best if you do . Brilliant plan . There was no backup , was there ? This is Tango Romeo Delta . Tell Gonzales we have his package . Backup . Aah ! Agent Hunter , Agent Peterson . Call me " Mike . " Aah ! That 's quite a handshake you 've got . Thanks for coming on such short notice . I see you 've taken well to the upgrades . No complaints here . You want me to get this bird in the air ? At some point , you might have mentioned that backup was a lethal cyborg . Truthfully , I just wanted to see the look on your face when he showed up ... priceless . Glad I amuse you . You know , I can hear you up here . It 's confirmed . Coulson has another powered person working with him , and guess who else . Hunter . If they get to Skye , this is gonna get way out of hand . They 've got one last bargaining chip left . Bring me the bus and Agent May . Well , it 's not pizza , but at least it 's not kale , which seems to be the only food they serve around here . Can you warm up food with your powers ? Because that would be awesome . I have never tried , but I did warm up a small pool once . Any 5-year-old can warm up a pool . What about you ? Come on . I showed you mine . Now you show me yours . And you 'll teach me to control it ? Once I know what we 're dealing with , a guide will be selected to help you master it . How long does it take to learn ? That depends on the gift ... how much you 've physically changed . You 're a piece of cake , compared to the other one ... total physical transformation , and we still have no idea what her gift is . You told me I was the only one . What ? You said that I was the first person to transition here in a really long time . That 's not what I meant . She 's here . You lied to me . I said there 's no one here who will harm you , and that 's true . She 's on her own path , Skye , just like you . She 's having a rough transition and deserves the same care . People died because of her . - Where is she ? - Skye . Skye . We need to protect her , the same way we protect you . She is one of us . I am not what she is . Get out of my way , Lincoln . You know I can 't control this . Raina ! Skye , isn 't this interesting ? I had a feeling I might see you . Skye , please , let 's just go . Let her stay . We have so much to talk about . What happened to you ? Destiny ... Apparently . I wanted to be set free , but now I can 't even bear the light of day . I dread being awake , but my sleep is filled with such horrible nightmares . Children are so afraid of monsters . They should know it 's worse to be one . You got what you deserved . And so did you . I didn 't deserve any of this . - You did this to me ! - Skye . No , you have brought nothing but pain into my life ... my father , the mist . My friend Trip died in there because of you ! I didn 't make you follow me into that chamber . You wanted to go . You needed to go because we 're the same , Skye . We were the same before , and we 're the same now . I am on the outside what you are on the inside . - No ! - Skye ! So that 's what you are . You need to stop . No ! Finish this ! End my nightmares ! Enough ! Who are you ? My name is Jiaying . You 're both guests in my house . You don 't know her . You have no idea what she 's capable of . She 's capable of beauty and greatness , just as we all are . She can 't be trusted . She killed people ! From what Gordon tells me , you could have , as well . And from what I just saw , you 're certainly capable of it . Why would you bring her here ? The same reason we brought you here ... she 's one of us . I am not anything like her . Whatever you two were in the past , that 's not what you are now . I can 't stay ... not if she 's here . We 'll leave that choice to you , but I have chosen to be your guide , should you remain with us . All I ask is for a few days . I 'll look after you , train you , watch you grow . And if you don 't feel a connection between us worth exploring , well ... We never have to see each other again . Let 's get you to your room . I was right , wasn 't I ? She 's here . I told you I would find her , and I did . You were right , Cal . It 's Daisy , our daughter . Thank you . Can I see her now ? No . This belonged to my father in the second world war . He used it to kill over a hundred Nazis . He said it always had a way of finding the right target at the right time . If you think I 'm a traitor , now 's your chance to do something about it . Pick it up . Pull the trigger . Let 's end this right now . Or you can hear me out . It 's come to my attention that I 'm not handling you properly . And since ... I must accept the recommendation of others when I 'm outvoted ... here we stand . Assuming you decide not to shoot me , I would like to offer you a seat on our board . What 's the catch ? No catch . We 're gonna bring Coulson in with or without your help . And when we do , he should have a strong advocate on the board . And then what ? That 's for us to decide . But right now he 's acting like a fugitive and a threat . We do not take any threat against S.H.I.E.L.D. lightly . Neither do I. I appreciate the theatrics , but even you 're not stupid enough to hand me a loaded gun . This is not about Coulson . It 's not about me . It 's not about anyone on this ship . It 's about S.H.I.E.L.D. We cannot afford to be enemies to each other when there are new threats out there waiting for the moment we are at our weakest . A house built on shifting sand will fall . And without a strong and united foundation , S.H.I.E.L.D. will fall again . I 'm asking you to help us defend her , Agent May . Take a seat on our board . Autopilot is set . Cruising at 45,000 feet . Any destination ? - Mexico . - I 'll let you know . Agent Peterson has been doing some overseas work for me . Remember List ? The Hydra head we didn 't cut off ? Mike 's been trailing him for the past six months . Tell him what you found . Last week , I intercepted a coded transmission from List mentioning his interest in powered people . Yeah , they seem to be trending these days . He 's hunting them down and experimenting on them . You think the no-eyed guy took Skye as one of his ? No , but he 's connected to Skye 's father and whatever group of powered people he 's involved with . Does Hydra know about them ? - Seems likely . - There 's only one man who 's connected to both sides of this equation . If we 're gonna find Skye , we need to find him first . And who 's that ? Our bad option . Grant Ward . We 'll return in a moment . I did everything in my power , but it wouldn 't open . It 's way beyond anything I 've ever encountered . Without Coulson or some miracle , I 'm afraid it 's just a worthless piece of junk . Airport , please . Nice work Jemma . With a hint of Pesto Aioli .

 Finally . You know , I almost got away . Lots of times , actually . Bribed the Port Authority £ 15,000 to look the other way , only for all the crossings to be cancelled due to a freak storm . Keeps happening , every time . Made me realise ... the bracelet doesn 't want me to go ! It won 't let me . Fair enough . I won 't try anymore . Time for something new . - It 's not a bad entrance . - Try it . I dare you . I rather like this suit . It 's just a bet . Where 's the harm ? I think we both know the answer to that . - If you want to learn , play the game . - I 've done that before . - And ? - I made my family homeless . Well , if you 'd won , they 'd be living in a palace . Hmm ... Your risks are what make you great , Harry . All right , Dr. Freud . It 's just water . Oh , you are very bad news . _ Harry ? Hi . Sorry , sorry . Sorry , but what are the chances ? Not just you seeing Harry just as he 's about to do something so ... Stupid ? ... interesting . But also you being in such handsome company . You know , I was actually quite nervous about meeting you , Harry . But I suppose this has broken the ice , eh ? - I 'm amazed they let you in like that . - Oh , Giovanni won 't mind . - Giovanni , the owner ? - He 's a friend . I get around . I 'm sure you do . - So , how long have you two been together ? - Oh , we 're not together . Not yet . He 's so old-fashioned , keeping me on tenterhooks . Someone please shoot me in the head . I bet you didn 't have to wait , did you , Anna ? I 'll have that gun when you 're finished with it . So , how did you meet ? Was it fantastically romantic ? Hardly . We work together . But I 've always admired her . You know , how she sees a case . How she holds all the facts in her head . And then she knows how to present them to a jury so that they see the story just as she wants them to . It 's ... It 's really sexy . Shit , sorry . Look , can we just order some bloody food ? I 'm starving . How did you two meet ? Um , I was ... Yes , hello ? What , now ? OK . Really ? - I 'm sorry , it 's my job . - You haven 't eaten . Great to meet you , Harry . - Hopefully next time we 'll , um ... - Yeah . - Hello . - Victim 's name 's Anthony Johnstone , 39 years old , died last Tuesday . Is there a bin anywhere ? I can 't go in with this . Just scoff it down ! No time to iron ? - So , Anthony ... ? - Johnstone . PM was last night . - Turns out he was killed by a blood clot . - That 's natural causes . Something strange turned up in the contents of his stomach . What ? - Human flesh . - Human ? So we may have a cannibal on our hands . How 's that kebab going down ? No , not a cannibal . Not in my opinion . What about the stomach contents ? Well , this fingernail made me suspicious , so I did a precipitate test which confirmed the meat is definitely human , but there 's also pork with apple and onion , sage ... All right , Ralph . What ? I don 't think Mr. Johnstone knew what he was eating . Did you say sage ? Oh , pastry . If Mr. Johnstone here had died of more obvious causes , then we 'd never have known . Indeed , he may have done it before , many times . I 'm sorry , done what ? Eaten a pie . _ Thank you . I 'll get you ... Two pence . Human remains ? Well , we 'd never ... Mr. Johnstone 's wife said he visited your stall most days . This is him . Oh , yeah . Big fan of the pork and sage . A bit snooty about the lamb and beetroot , though . Not an adventurous type , you know ? - You think I did it . - You made the pies yourself ? W-What kind of sick pervert do your think I am ? The only thing I add to these pies is love . Where do you get your meat ? Not some common supermarket , thank you very much . - I put my heart into each and every pie . - So , where do you get your meat ? - Smithfield Market , of course . - Which butcher , which stall ? I don 't have a regular supplier . I like to sniff out a bargain . I 'm ruined . Human meat in my pies ? Well , it can 't be her . She doesn 't look like a Mrs. Lovett , does she ? - A who ? - You know . Sweeney Todd , the musical ? The Demon Barber of Fleet Street . You sing a bit . I 'll see if I remember . - If you think I 'm falling for that ... - Harry . Suri . A neighbour heard screams in the street last night . Further investigation led to this . We haven 't ID 'd the woman yet . She looks familiar . Now , the plates are false , obviously , but then we found this . We managed to clean up the image . You don 't see anything until he turns around and it 's only for a split second . - Oh , my God . - Golding . That 's Golding . - Oh , no . - Get a squad car to Anna 's chambers now . He 's smiling . That 's not a man on the run . DI Clayton . I 've just had the call from Daisy 's school . She 's safe , she 's been brought here . No , they can take her home . I 'll meet her there . OK . I 've got officers on the door day and night , I 've got a panic alarm being fitted , we 've got plainclothes at the end of the street . I know . It 's all been explained . I can 't work here . Your officers are scaring off my clients . I could take you both home . Explain it all to Daisy . Right , can you wait by the car , please ? Thank you . Look , I know you 'll catch him . You 're a brilliant cop , if nothing else . And I 'll get Daisy to court , it 's good she hears it from you . - Thank you . - Why is he back ? I thought you said he 'd want to keep as far away from us as possible . - I 'll tell you when I catch him . - Well , I 'm glad you 're so confident . You 've got luck on your side , haven 't you ? I saw the bracelet on her wrist , Harry . Just like yours . Does she get you , is that it ? Do you get lucky together ? Well , she 's fun , at least . I 'll find him . I 'll catch him . Good luck . Nikhail Julian . Better known as Golding . He 's guilty of multiple murder , kidnapping , extortion , and blackmail . He exploited his role as prison governor to build a criminal empire . Well , this is our chance to put him away for good . We can track the van using CCTV . How far have we got on that , anyone ? And we 'll need to go back to the original witness . Find out exactly what she heard . - What ? - You can 't be working on this case , Harry . Not with your personal history . - My history ? What about yours ? - When we put him on trial , the defence will rip holes in our case if you 're involved . - You know that . - I promised Anna . - Who 's running it now ? - I am . - I 'll keep you informed at every stage . - What am I supposed to do ? ! Got a DNA match on the meat found in Mr. Johnstone 's stomach . What ? The human remains . We know who they belong to . Are you kidding me ? Had to hire a pool car , huh ? Sexy . So . What have we got ? The human remains found in Mr. Johnstone 's stomach belong to a man named Adam Sykes . This is his house . Neighbours haven 't seen him for a week . Adam Sykes . Yeah , I knew him . Forger . Apparently , it was a fluke we were able to get the DNA . Normally , when meat 's cooked and digested , you don 't get anything , so ... That was lucky , eh ? Police ! Stay where you are . Let 's go . Police ! Listen , I get you don 't want to be here . I 'm not thrilled to be working under you either . - That 's your fault . - Stay where you are ! All right , so you 're not responsible for any of the shit that 's going down right now ? Anything ? We 've got incomplete passports , false tax returns , gas bills ... Everything you need to set up a new identity . But no forger . No sign of a struggle , either . So he was killed somewhere else . Maybe . The last time I caught Sykes , he was trying to flog forged bare bonds to Russian undergraduates from Imperial College . When we nabbed him , his hands were covered in ink , his shirt was covered in his breakfast . This place doesn 't ... Can we get some Luminol and UV lights in here ? Good . - Again , please . Once more . - You heard the DI . Wait , go back . There . Blood . Give me that . Well , if he was killed her , it wouldn 't be a single speck . - There 'd be blood spatter and ... - And there . And there . Fshhh ! - Arterial spray . - Yeah . - Some job cleaning that up , eh ? - Professional . The meat for the pies . Where did she buy it ? Smithfield . Right . Where do we start ? Well , if she had no regular supplier , and always paid cash ... You do know we 've had police here searching already , yeah ? Find the bloke that sold her the mince , we 're one step closer to the killer . Brilliant . Right , I 'll start down this end . And I 'll see you in a month . Hello . - I can 't help you . - Well , I haven 't asked yet . I might be looking for 40 kilos of lambs ' brains . You 're a cop . Wouldn 't get anything out of anyone here . That 's how it is . - And how do you know I 'm a cop ? - The way you talk . The way you walked in . Takes a certain type of person to recognise a cop . Normally , someone who 's been in trouble . Some knife . Bet it 's sharp . - It can cut straight through the bone . - Really ? Even human bone ? I heard a story about some poor bloke , had his arm cut clean off . How did that happen ? Didn 't look where he was going , so I heard . - Do you mind ? That 's unhygienic . - Sorry . - We need some more , mate . - I 'll see you , Jim . So what do you use to keep it all so spick and span ? Why do you care ? Oh , I 'm just interested , you know ? Must be a lot of blood that needs cleaning up . I just wonder what you use to make sure there 's no trace of anything left behind . Solarvac cleaner ? Amphesine ? - Where do you keep it ? - In my van . Oh , I fancy taking a peek at that . - Bet it 's spotless , too . - Yeah , it is . Come on , then . It 's this way . Backup . Get me backup , now . Harry , are you here ? Harry ? Who is it ? Who we looking for ? Needle in a haystack , Harry . Al , Any luck ? - We found his van . - Where ? - Look at the plates . - What ? It 's the van Golding was in . Looks to me like Golding 's taken him under his wing , protected him and used him for his skills . He kills his victims , he butchers them , and they end up in pies . So the woman he abducted ... We need to find her , fast . These cases are linked now , Harry . What , you 're saying I can 't work on either case ? I think Sykes was providing a new identity for Golding , and once Golding got it , he got rid of Sykes to cover his tracks . OK , stop . What we don 't know is why Golding didn 't use that identity to escape . Sir , I found out who the girl is . It 's Eve Alexandri . - Golding killed her mother , right ? - Yeah . Wait , Harry , you-you knew her . Why would Golding take her ? I don 't know . All right , Suri , dig out everything else you can find on Miss Alexandri . Harry . I 'm fine , I 'm going home , I 'm not getting involved . You knew who she was before I worked it out . You knew , and you didn 't say , did you ? Oh , my God , I can 't believe it . We 're back here again ! You doing stuff you shouldn 't be , and me having to cover it up . Suri , if I knew anything else , I 'd tell you . Ever since she turned up and you started wearing that bracelet . What , this ? I 've had it for ages . Richard gave it to me as a present . Ever since then , you 've been odd . And by the way , it looks really stupid on you . Suri , please . Why has he taken her ? It 's me asking , not Winter . Tell me so I can find her ! It 's me , Harry . Hi . Been a while . If you 're here about your man Golding , it 's a wasted trip . - They already told me . - I wanted you to hear it from me . - Well , you 're too late . - Come on , Rich , I did what you asked . I 've kept my distance . - And yet , here you are . - Cos I miss you . I miss my brother . Look , maybe when this is over and we catch him , we can go out for a pint ? Just like that ? Well , I 'd be buying , obviously . Rich ... You sounded so stressed on the phone , I thought you 'd appreciate a more soothing environment . I haven 't had a chance to thank you for your performance with my wife . Wasn 't that hilarious ? She 's gorgeous , by the way . You set all that up ? I think you 're meant to say , " But not as gorgeous as you . " You did . Jesus . I just wanted to see how you were with her . I 'd like to know what 's stopping you from kissing me . My torch has been kidnapped . Golding 's involved . I don 't know why , but I 've been kicked off the case , so I 'm on my own without any resources , and I have to find her . Isabella . I don 't care . Neither would you if you knew who she really was . What ? Eve is my torch too . Yes , she 's known about me and the bracelet all along . Now , why didn 't she tell you ? I , err ... I don 't know why . I had two children , Harry . Two beautiful baby girls . And she 's the reason I lost them . Dead because of her . - Jesus , what happened ? - Don 't . Forget about her . - What happened ? - No , don 't . Isabella . She 's my only way to find Golding . To keep Anna and Daisy safe . - So do it . - No , I can 't without you . The man who caught Eve cuts people to pieces . Good . That selfish little bitch has sabotaged your life . - Right now , I don 't care . - But you will . Please help me . No . - You 'd do the same if it was Daisy . - Jesus . You 'd do worse . - Stay away from me . - I 'm trying to save you . Stay away from me . Boss . - You said you 'd be careful . - I was . I was meticulous . - I don 't know how he found me . - You never know . That 's the thing , the bloody thing . Now he knows you , we 'll never catch him . I 'll be more careful next time . It can 't work , unless we catch him unawares . That was the only way to get him back here . Don 't attack him . Just put him in that and wait for him to die . It was the only way , the only bloody way . No . Just chop his head off . I keep telling you , you can 't , you don 't know anything . It 's over . Right . Change of plan . - What , because of some bloody bracelet ? - Forget about the bracelet . Forget about Harry . We need to cover our tracks . Right . Kill her , get rid of the body . - No , wait . Wait . - And no traces . I 'll pay you after it 's done . - Stop ! - Then you 're on your own . I can help you . I can help you beat Harry . - No , you can 't . - Yes , I can . There 's a second bracelet and I know the woman who wears it . She 's stronger than he is . - No . No ! - Wait . If you get her on your side , you can do anything you want to him . Just tell him to put down the bloody knife . Yeah ? Suri , how do you suppose Harry just found the butcher ? - I 'm working . - Cos I was watching him . He didn 't do anything I wouldn 't have done , but it 's always him . - He 's always the one . - Steve ... - Hmm ? - I 'm working . Uhh ! What 've you got ? Last year , we froze Golding 's bank accounts , assets , et cetera . But he 's obviously still got access to money somehow . Exactly . So I 've used the facial recognition software on cashpoints and got some hits . But the software 's unreliable , so I 'm hunting down guys that look like Golding , but aren 't him . It 's a wild goose chase . No , not necessarily . Your search is just too narrow . You want to find Golding , you 've got to look bigger . Well , you 're not here to preach the gospel , are you ? Not quite . We 're here to ask for your help , Isabella Augustin . Goodness . They know my name . I 'm ruined . We 'd like you to help us kill Harry Clayton . May I see it ? Come get it , if you think you 're hard enough . Eve says you 've been wearing it for ten years . Says you can summon luck like it 's your own personal genie . Eve talks too much . And she gave the bracelet to the wrong man . I was always meant to have that bracelet , and I would have done so much more with it than Harry ever could . I think he 's growing into it quite nicely . No . His mind 's too tidy . Too black and white . I think his mind is a little darker than you realise . And he 's good for me . If what Eve told me is right ... You 'd do well not to mention that girl again . When Harry learns about your predilections , he 'll come after you . He 'll hunt you down , and however brilliant you may be , he will win . But not me . I would never stop you . I think Harry 's falling for me . And I think he 'll love me in time , whatever my faults . He 'll only ever love one woman . So what do you want ? You help me get the bracelet off Harry , I get Eve to put it on me , and then ... whatever you want . - You 'll kill him ? - Of course . - And I could kill Eve , too , if you like . - No . I want to do that . _ _ When my girls died , my body seized up . Grief grabbed me , choked me . I 'd be walking down a road and see a child , and ... My legs would give way . I thought at least the pain would one day pass . In a way , it has got better , but ... Some days , I wake and it 's a good minute before I think of them . Then I think of Eve ... But I 'll help . Because it 's you . It 's all I 've got . Help me find her . Please . It 's killing me . As you wish . You used the cashpoints to find Golding , I then linked them with mobile phones being used in the area . That gives us 340 matches . We then ruled out any mobile phones not paid for by cash or using pay-as-you-go contracts . - That brings us down to the three . - The three . One of which is currently being driven up the M1 . Motorway cameras showed that to be driven by a 29-year-old female . Another one was dropped down a toilet in a nightclub last night by a teenager named Aaron Holt . And that leaves one . It 's got to be Golding . It 's got to be Golding . We just need him to turn his bloody phone on . And then we 've got him . - You 're a good cop ... - Mm-hm . - ... for a wally . - First of all , who says " wally " anymore ? Secondly , ditto . Even though I 'm sure you 'd be a nightmare girlfriend . 'Scuse me ? Well , with your backhanded compliments all day , everyday , I pity the ... wally . Shut up . I think we 're near . The bracelets will lead us . _ We 've got him . Let 's go . Target located . We need SO19 now . So , luck brings us here . - You 're sure ? - I think so . This is the place . _ We 've found him . Yes , we have . Well done , darling . Are you ready yet ? I just want to cut his arm off with one slice . Well , I 'm done waiting . Let 's go . Right . In a minute , my friend here is going to cut off Harry 's arm thanks to Isabella and your introduction . Now , Harry might die of shock . More likely blood loss , actually . Either way , once he 's gone , you will give me the bracelet , right ? Eve , do you understand me ? Oh , dear . Isabella , why ? Oh . You were getting boring . And still in love with your wife . I get jealous . Do it . And I was starting to like you . That can be dangerous . It 's much safer to feel nothing at all . At least with Golding , I won 't have to worry about that . Oh , please . Did you really think I would choose you over my lovely Harry Clayton ? Ahh ! You bastard ! Eve ! Bastard ! It 's what you 've always wanted . Eve , don 't . - All my life . All my life , Harry . - I know , but you can 't . - Watch me . - No , Eve ! I will come after you , I will find you , and I will put you in prison where he should be . - Then I 'll kill you too . - No , you won 't . Put him away . - Make his pain last . - I dreamed of this . I know , but we 're not monsters , Eve . There 's no way back if you do this . Please . So I got him . Golding . As I promised . You have to start trusting me . You have to . No , you don 't . - Harry , she 'll hurt you . - You just betrayed him . - He was going to kill me . - He knows you 're my torch . He knows all the lies you told . Harry , I promise . - You 've got Golding . Please leave . - Harry , I ... She 's right . You got what you want from me . The police will be here soon . Come find me . Trust me . This is the end . Yes . An ex-prison governor behind bars ? They 're going to do terrible things to you . Harry ! Harry , I 'll give you £ 1 million . £ 1 million . Just let me go . - Smile ! - Harry ! Harry , £ 2 million . Harry , - £ 2 ... £ 3 million ! £ 5 million ! - Harry ! Anna , we got him . Yeah , it 's over . Oh , sorry . The cavalry have arrived . Harry , what are you doing here ? What took you so long ? Still a lot of questions . You shouldn 't have been anywhere near him . I was just out for a wee dander . Yeah , you 've already given me that utterly implausible story . I was worried when I heard you 'd found him first . I thought you might do something stupid . I 'm glad you proved me wrong . - Thank you . - Bet Anna 's relieved . Sure she is . - I 'm trying not to interfere . - Right . - So I-I 'm no expert on your personal life . - Alistair , I make her unhappy . No , you don 't . I saw that last time she was here , the way she still looks at you , God knows why . So you 're not interfering ? Meanwhile , what 's she doing ? Tonight , I believe she 's at a ball with her new boyfriend . And you 're doing what ? Sitting here ? You fool . Go . Now . Win her back . What are you doing here ? Waiting for you . That 's all I do .

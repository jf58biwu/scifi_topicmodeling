Rachel is too damaged for this responsibility . She 's done pretty well so far . She tried to kill me . I didn 't intend for her to go that far . - I 'm sorry , Susan . - No , you 're not . Your corporate-raised psychopath is finally paying dividends . But admit it : Scientifically , you 're lost without me . That 's why I need you , Susan .

To the future . ( music intensifies )

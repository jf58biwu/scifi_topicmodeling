I 'm Anthony ... - Mom ! - Evan ! - Mom ! Oh , really ? - No , don 't kill it ! Don 't kill it . - Ok ... - Just don 't . These things are terrifying but I can 't kill them . - You 're still freaking about it . It 's fine . - I 'm sorry . - It 's OK , mom . - Thanks sweetie . Evan , do you remember what we talked about last night ? About getting registered in time ? - Yeah ... - I don 't want to have another drama with your dad . - You are the one who woke me up with that crazy screaming . - You may recall that I had a few thoughts about you getting asleep last night . - I told you I was doing homework ! - Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ... - Stop ! - Homework ? You were on Facebook for like three hours . Come on , sweetie , we gotta go . - Are you ready ? - Are you kidding ? Of course I 'm ready . Are you ready ? That 's what I want to know . - I was born ready . There 's nothing that scares me . You 're the chicken . - Ah , Once we 've done it you won 't believe how great we 'll feel . It will redefine us . - I need that . - Any time we start to think " Can I really do this ? " The answer I 'll always tell is " Hell , yeah . " Hell yeah . - I went skydiving . Jumped a little fucking plane . I 'm capable of anything . - I can tell . This is what you need . - Yeah , Oh , yeah . - The environmental devastation we are suffering now , the damage to the water supplies and the food ... I was going to make you eggs . - that was strategic ... - I don 't like eggs . - All of us ... You can 't eat the same thing every morning . - Why not ? Stop . I 'm gonna make the eggs and you 're gonna eat them . I love you and I want you healthy . - You should call dad about that . - I can handle a simple lighting job . - What are you looking for ? - My Exacto . Strip off the ends of the wires . Get a clean connection , problem solved . I don 't need your dad for that . - Just call an electrician anyways . - At least he doesn 't need to sweat about money . - Hey mom , I need help , in another assignment besides the math stuff , by the way . - Sure , which one , hon ? - The one about that family tree . - Well , I thought we did that one already . - We did your side of the family . - So talk to your dad . - Could you ... call him for me ? Uh ... . what is the point of the assignment anyway ? - Miss Delgado says everybody should know where they came from and who we are . - I hate doing your homework . - Come on , mom , you know dad . He doesn 't like helping me . I 'll do three more math problems right now , if you call him for me . - Hmm ... four ? - Three . - Four . God damn it ! Fucking homework ! I hate that shit . - Hey champ , forget about the math . We need to go . I 'll wait in the car . Are you seriously texting me from upstairs ? - Mommy ! Mommy ! - Renee , I got the tickets . The flight 's ready . Don 't be too scared . See you soon , sweetie . - Who was that ? - Margaret work . - To erase message , press nine . - Scared of what ? Where are you going ? - I 'm going skydiving today . - What ? You didn 't tell me that . What if something happens ? - It will be insanely fun . I 'll be fine , baby . - Next message . - Hey , Renee . You 're not calling me back ? I thought we had a great time . Give me a call when you have a chance . - Was that Adam ? - Alan , yeah . - Do you like him ? - None of your business . - Next message . - Don 't take him to school Friday . I 'm going to start the weekend short so don 't fucking drag us down with your nonsense . Alright ? - Was that dad ? - He is not always as nice to me as he is to you , baby . It 's okay . - Pick him up 5 PM , because I 've got a date Tuesday night . - Listen , Cliff , you 'll should know he heard you cursing at me . - Whoa , when was that ? - On my voice mail . - Well , that 's your fault for letting him listen to your messages . I mean , come on , you play them in your car , right in front of him . He 's doing that thing again with his homework . - He just ... He needs to focus . You know what his tutor said . - Well , maybe he needs a better tutor . - So you want to spend more ? It 's the way he reacts when he can 't solve a problem . - He 's good in school . He 's good in school . If you could just help him a little bit more ... - I 'll try . Alright ? I 'll try . - You 'll try ? - That is why it is good thing that we only have one kid . You realize he knows we 're talking about him . Just say goodbye . - Bye , honey ! - Are you really going skydiving ? - Don 't worry . I 'll be fine , I 'll ... I 'll send you pictures . - Just don 't die , okay ? - I promise . I love you . - Love you , too . - Ok , do it . - What the fuck ? Oh shit ! Oh no ... What the hell ? - Want some help ? - Well .. - Sucks to have that happen . - Yeah , yeah , I don 't know what that is . It 's something jammed in here . Come off ! - I don 't know . - Did you drive over that ? - I didn 't feel anything . - Maybe it was dropped off a truck out here ? I wouldn 't just pull it out of there . A garage will do that without tearing up the whole tire . You got roadside insurance ? ' Cause then you could get that replaced for free . - Why should I do something so practical ? It 's okay . I 've changed tires before . I 'm fine . - Are you sure ? I 'm here . I can help . Why do you want to do it yourself ? - If you insist . It 's ... it 's pretty nice of you . - No problem . Listen , I 've had my share of flats in my life , I could probably do this with my eyes closed . Tommy , wait in the van . - If you guys are talking I want to smoke . - You must have some place to be . - No , we 're just headed to a swap meet . We 've got to check out crockpots . Everybody 's talking about crock pots . My sister even has got me this crockpot cookbook . She said they 're everywhere now . I said , " Are you sure you don 't mean track pots ? " - Okay . Shall we ? - Yeah . I 'm gonna get your spare on , and then you get to a garage and get past this ... ? Should be one just a little ways down , right at the intersection of 42 and I-70 . There 's a Mike 's ice-cream shop right there . Got the big cone outside . - Go ! Do it . - All good ? - No worries . - This is gonna wear off in about fifteen minutes . Alright . No , no , it 's okay . Hold still . Okay . We 're going to be driving for a long time . Nod yes if you want me to pull off your panties to make it easier to pee . Okay . I 'm going to undo one of your legs . You can put your underwear aside . Good girl . - Fill it up , I 'm going to hit the head . - You seem to be holding up fine . Open your mouth wide . I mean it , I mean it . I don 't want to jab you . This has some sleeping pills dissolved in it . Now , you 're gonna some need to rest before what happens next . Swallow , swallow , swallow . Swallow . Well done . What do they do ? - What do you want from me ? No , no . - Where are we putting her ? - We need to check with Terrence . - They need us . - What for ? What are these fucking people ? - G10-12 x . Remember that . - What 's that ? - G10-12 x . - Where are we ? G10-12 x , G10-12 x ... - Okay , let 's take the tape off you . You take care of the pants . - I 'll be right back . - Help ! Help ! - Don 't joke around . This will loosen up the tape . We have food for you , as long as you don 't scream . - I 'm not going to eat your fucking food . - Not that you can 't scream all you want . The facility is secure , but the screams ... They 'll unsettle the other subjects . Hold still . Interesting skin . If it 's going to happen , I 'll tell you . It will happen fast . You will think that you can 't survive , and then ... Wham ! You will be amazed . Unless , of course , it doesn 't happen , in which case , ... we 'll handle you another way entirely . - Where are you taking me ? No , don 't take me back there . No ! Hello ? ! I am the room next door ! My name is Blake ! I can hear you struggling . I promise I am not one of them ! What is your name ? - Renee . I 'm Renee . How long have you been here ? - I 've lost track ! They say I have one last chance to perform ! - To perform ? Well , what do you mean perform ? - They bring something into your room , something you don 't want brought in . - Like what ? - Whatever they figured out by watching you . It 's different for everyone . - What is G10-12X ? - What ? - G10-12X . I saw someone in the hallway . He said they need us , they need us for G10-12X . - I have no idea . - This isn 't about ransom . - Are you rich ? - Hardly . - Do you know anyone rich ? - Not really . - Me neither . Where are you from ? - Kansas City ... Missouri . - Maybe that 's where we are . - No , I was in that van forever . They drugged me . I don 't know how long we drove . - Me , too ! - Where are you from ? - Elko , Elko , Nevada . Are you trying to get free ? It won 't happen . - How many people are being held here ? - 20 . The first day I arrived here , I heard someone in your room being released . - Why wouldn 't he tell people what 's going on here ? He knew you were still here , right ? - Maybe he didn 't know where we are . - Maybe he 's dead . - Blake , we asked you to stay quiet . - I just wanted to talk to someone . No , not my eyes ! Not my eyes ! Not my eyes ! - Hold him down . - How 's are you so far , Renee ? - Blake told me you sometimes let people go . - Who is Blake ? - You know , Blake . Next door . - Is Blake the name of some voice you heard ? And you believed everything it said ? Maybe that gave you some comfort . Or maybe everything here 's been arranged to mislead you and this Blake is a part of that . Or you maybe you should believe this Blake , because maybe I 'm just fucking with you right now . - We often find after we 're done we need to record everything that happens . The footage can help us see exactly what went wrong . - Please ... Please ... If you need me to like me not ... say anything ... . I won 't . But you have to let me go . I have a son . - Evan . Yes , we know about your son . - Is ... is this about him somehow ? Is he here somewhere ? Did you take him ? You didn 't take him , did you ? I need to see my son , Please ! - We haven 't taken your son . He is with his father for the weekend , just where you left him . - What do you want from me ? - Try to breathe normally . - if you let me go , I 'll fucking breathe normally ! - This is just a blood-pressure test . - State your name . - Renee Morgan . - Your full name . Renee Marie Morgan . - Place of birth ? - Montreal , Canada . - And your date of birth ? - August 25th , 1980 . - Is that the date of birth you ... ? - Are you the Government ? - Your height ? - Are you the Government ? - Your height , please . - Five foot five . - Are ... are you some government ? - Weight ? Your current weight . - 150 . Are you ... ? Oh , wait , are you the CDC ? Was I exposed to some germ or ... or disease or virus ? You would tell me if I was sick , right ? You would tell me if there was something wrong with me ? - Renee , the questions that you 're asking just aren 't pertinent . - Shut up ! Shut up , you fucking freak and let me go ! What do you want me to do ? I 'll help . I 'll cooperate . You have to let me go . It 'll be easier if I cooperate , right ? Just tell me what to do . - Read the bottommost line . - M ... I ... I don 't know . - Try again . - I ... I can 't make those out . - Any food allergies ? - No . - Not sunflower oil or sunflower seeds ? - Uh ... I don 't know . I never really liked eating seeds . Why you ask ? - Did you notice any change in your allergies after you gave birth ? - No . Please , please , don 't leave my son without me . - 42 , 67 , 44 ... - What ? - What do you think I just said ? - Four , something . I ... I don 't know . - Say yes if you suffer or have ever suffered from one of the following : Angina . - No . - Asthma , - No . - Bronchitis . - No . - Scarlet fever , - No - Rheumatic fever . - No . - kidney stones ... - No . - Sinusitis . - No . - Emphysema ... - No . - Anemia ... - Sometimes . - Reproductive system issues ? - Good . - Number of children ? - One . - Desired number of children ? - None of your business . - Report suggested that you wanted more than one child . - The report should know that I am divorced . - Compulsive habits such as nail-biting , restless pacing , finger drumming Cracking knuckles ? - No . - No ? You don 't drum your fingers sometimes ? - Christ ... How long have you been watching me ? - Fear of darkness ? - No . - Fear of sex ? - No . Fear of snakes ? - No . - Fear of drowning ? - No . - Fear of spiders ? Fear of spiders ? - Right now I 'm afraid of everything . Okay ? - This is just so that we don 't have to go poking at you again and again . - You 'll feel it soon . I 'm sure. of it Come on ! Fuck ! Fuck ! Oh shit ! - Good color . - Hungry ? - No . - Interesting skin . And her file is impressive , isn 't it ? - Yes , it is , Dr. Raxlen . - I 'll gladly make my mark . - If it were up to me , we 'd go straight to your desk but I have agreed with the others to go through protocol . - Lights . - Is that the G10-12 x ? - How do you about G10-12 x ? - I don 't . - If she already knows about it is extremely good news . - No . I ... I just heard about it in the corridor . - This is hardly a G10-12 x . If you find out what it is then , you have made great progress . This is a solution that can help accelerate the process . Think of it as chemical encouragement to an entirely different way of life . - 40 ccs administered at ... ? - 11.39 AM . Renee , you are being very brave . You don 't have to cater to her , Diane . If she 's going to help us , she 'll understand . If she doesn 't ... - What do you want from me ? What do you want with me ? Please let me see my son again . Please . Evan . My Evan ... - Leave her right there . I 'll get her feet up in the stirrups . - Yes , Doctor . ? - You have something very special in you , Renee . - Evan ... - Of course you will see your boy again . But we need you first . - Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! - I am very pleased with that little nap you took . Not everyone absorbs the solution that way . An excellent sign . - I won 't last long . - You don 't know that . - I was supposed to get married next month . Tell my fiancee I love her . - She can 't help you now , Seth . - Renee , we 're trying to help you . - What ? Oh , no ! Oh , please , no ! Oh , no ... Oh ... Oh , no . - Oh , please . Please , please , please , stop it , please ! - We 're not the ones who can stop this . - Oh my God ! - Oh please ... . Oh please ... - What do you want from me ? - Stop asking us . It 's up to you . - The venom of this particular species is extremely virulent . Human spinal fluid literally boils when it encounters the poison . - Renee , don 't fight it . Let it happen . - Nothing yet . - Please , stop . - I thought that it would happen right away . - Maybe on the second test . - Did you understand ? Did you learn what I was telling you ? - I don 't understand anything of this . Every time I touch her , it feels right . I just know she 's going to rupture . I believe in her . - If he 's right , it will be over soon . And then you 'll know who you are going to be for the whole rest of your life . Of course this will involve pain . Let her rest now . - Help me , please ! Please ! What the fuck do you want from me ? ! No ! No ! - I am nothing more than your mind , you know that . ? The time we spent was special to me . Just the two of us . Our special bond . You know how much I adore you . You 're safe , my son . Right here . With Dad . - Do not be mistaken . It 's entirely up to you , Charlie . - Try to breathe normally . I 'm just checking to make sure you 're absorbing the accelerator . - Dr . Raxlen . - Let 's see . Hmm ... Seth , do you remember going to the lab ? - No . I don 't know . - Maybe his DNA is just too corrupted . - Try drowning him again . Probably he 'll respond . - No ! Please , please , no ! Please , no , please , no ! - Yes , but it 's in six weeks . ? - The fucking generator is pulsing again . - Yeah , I 'll get on it . I 'll get a part in town . - Did you hear about Budapest ? - What about it ? - There 's a new rupture there . She 's for real . ? - With the guy in Boston , that 's a total of 47 ruptures . - What 's the fertility test on the Budapest chick ? - Nothing . Sterile . - Fuck ! - Yeah , 24 women and none of them fertile . - Raxlen got any ideas ? - I don 't know . I haven 't heard of it . - Hello ? - Hello ? - Who 's that ? - Blake ? - Are you Renee ? - Yeah . - How did you get up there ? - If we can just figure out where they keep those bracelets we can work the doors and get out . - They 're gonna let me go . I 'll survive it . - I don 't think freedom has a plan for us . You sound different . - I 'm in the middle of my final test . - Which is ... ? - I can 't say it . - Did he mention G10-12 x ? - They said I have it . They think it 's inside me . - What is it ? - There is something about the skin . They 've were rubbing my face . - Blake , you were close . Your terror almost initiated the DNA change . - What 's gonna happen to me now ? - You 'll be home soon . I just need to stake you for the journey . ? - Please , I ... I want to go home . - This may feel a little cold . - Blake , you 're going to wake up back in Nevada . Near your home . And you will remember an experience that will change the way you look at the world . - I don 't want to remember anything . - When you 're outside again , you will feel wonderful . You 'll have answers to questions that people have been asking for a long , long time . - Doesn 't that sound exciting ? - Yes , yes , it does . - Blake , we 're going to teach you how to think about what went on here . Do you understand ? - Yes . - No falling asleep just yet . Alright ? - Okay . - I 'm Collette . I 'm in charge of reintegration . Are you ready for that ? Are you ready to go back to life ? - I want to . - Fuck ! - Try to get the rest . - You sure ? - You see ? He was so close . He and Blake . - Don 't talk to me about close . - There 's still Renee Morgan . - It 's time to see if you could help her along , Diane . - Yeah , good idea , let 's get ready for her . - Any hallucinations ? - No . I ... I ... know . What 's in that orange stuff ? - You 're not sure if you 're hallucinating ? - I 've seen some weird shit . If you tell me it 's not real I 'll feel much better . - Well , this confusion is all part of the process . The pulse is good . She is ready to go . I 'll let them know . Good luck , Renee . We all have very high hopes for you . - This would be so much easier if you 'd just stopped fighting . If you try to frighten people to death , they fight back . No , Renee , We 're trying to frighten you past death . - What the fuck is that supposed to mean ? - Your son is going to be just fine . The problems he 's having with math , his inability to control his emotions , his anger . We can solve those problems . - How do you know ? - You just told me through your skin . We learn things that way . - What ? - G10-12 x is a genetic code . We all have it in our chromosomes . We are trying to rupture that part of your genes . - What happens when you rupture ? - I think you know what to do . When you take the fear in your bones , it changes the shape of you . Accept it . Be yourself . I 'll show you what we really are . Maybe that will help you . Fuck ! - How long have you been ... ? - He is back . - I 'll show you what I 'm talking about . The ovum we removed from Renee Morgan . It 's not behaving like any other ovum I 've examined before . - Is that good ? - I hope so . Take a look . - What 's so unusual ? - Those are human sperm , not ours . The ovum is no longer permitting any human sperm to penetrate to the membrane . I think Renee is close . Her egg might only receive our DNA now . I 'll have to take more samples , but ... - What ? - Fuck ! - You 've taken out your IV again . Would you like some solid to eat ? - What was in that ? - Just a sugar solution . We had to keep you going somehow . It 's been a day and a half . - It doesn 't feel that long . - Time moves differently for us . We don 't degenerate at the human pace . - Are you going to punish me for breaking into the lab ? - No ... Why would you think that ? We like the ones with a strong survival instinct and spirit . - Some food , perhaps ? - I don 't want anything from you . - 42 , 67 , 44 . - Tell me what I just said . - No . - You heard her . - 42 , 67 , 44 . - Good . - Can you read this ? - It is my medical record . - It was too small for you to read before . Have your eyes become sensitive to white light , like ours ? We prefer softer bands of the spectrum , like , uh , purple , yellow . - Are you trying to make me into you ? - This is something you have to do yourself , Renee . From within . - I don 't want to change . - Why would you fight this marvelous transformation ? The rupture will spare you so many fears . This is the next step on the evolutionary ladder . All that human emotional nonsense can be obliterated forever . - Please , you have to let me go . My son needs me . - You need to eat , Renee . - Dr . Raxlan 's told us that you 've been strikingly resourceful in your time with us . Did you think you ran all over this facility without us knowing ? - Now , perhaps you 'd like to see your son . - Once you rupture , you will no longer feel this human love . - Now that medical records are available online , we 'll find more leads . There are markers in your profile . Your blood pressures , certain allergies , family histories . All these details showed us the G10-12 x-sequence in your gene be accessible . - Enough . - I have seen you . You 're not human . None of you are . - We started as human , just like you . But then ... If you pass the test , Renee , your terror will transform you ... into someone fundamentally new . The human race is destroying everything . The Earth , the oceans , even the sky . - People are the virus and we are the cure . Order must be restored . Do you understand ? And only we can do it . All of this will become clear , as it did was for us with our own ruptures . And then you 'll join us in our world . - Which is ? - First , we must build our numbers . ? And if you rupture , we 'll be one stronger . - And if I don 't ? - Sometimes we 're mistaken about the potential of certain prospects . When they survive , Collette has found a way to safely return them to their lives .. When they don 't ... - Their skin corrodes . - Because their DNA is corrupted . Honestly , I think we 're doing the gene pool a favor by raiding them out . Cull in the herd , so to speak . - Another bite ? - No . - Let 's move forward then . - No ... Oh no ... Take it off me ! - It is entirely up to you , Renee . - Go to hell ! Tell everybody that Evan and I are great . I 've just got this incredible job and ... I can 't release anything about it yet . - That 's good , Renee . But you 'll fool people by adding enthusiasm to your voice . Le 's try again . - I 've got this incredible job . - What is it ? - I can 't really talk about it yet . - Why not ? - If I 'm ... If I 'm lucky , you hear about it soon . - Now , your friends and colleagues will notice you 've changed but never give them any explanation , no matter how hard they might pry . - Five tornadoes in Oklahoma , another three in Nebraska and two in Kansas , and that is in the last twelve months . - I really never really expected to be one of those people . The abductees . - Blake , where did it happen ? - I was at home in Nevada . And not the desert , the nice suburbs . I 'd just gotten out of dinner from Red Lobster and this white orb descended from the clouds . It pulled me up . I melted through the wall . They wanted to know all about the people in this planet . They took fluids from me . It wasn 't painful , but I had no choice . - Hi , mom . - We don 't have any milk ? Didn 't you go shopping while I was at dad 's ? - I can make you toast . - You 're wearing colored contacts ? - Yeah . - Why ? - I wanted to try something new . - Oh . Sweetheart , while you were at your father 's , I met people who who are incredibly good with math . They had these ... workshops that ... . uh ... I think could help you make good progress . - Mom , I don 't ... think so . - It will only be for a few days . Be open minded . - No ! Who are these people , anyways ? - They are very smart . - Forget it , I 'm not going ! You 're acting really weird . What the hell is wrong with you , mom ? - Where is Evan , Renee ? - Is that necessary ? - Please don 't use it on him . - No , no , only if we need to . - He doesn 't need-- - - Stay ... calm . You must recognize the amazing potential that exists in your genetic line . - That 's wonderful news , Renee . We got the test back . You 're still fertile even after the rupture . This also builds extremely well for Evan . - Where is he now ? - He will be down soon . He 's just packing some stuff . - Ah . - Try the bedroom . - Evan ? - Mom ! Mom ! - The door is locked . - Kick it open . - Get out of here ! - He got out . - We 're not going to be chasing him . Do you know why ? Because you and I , we 're gonna find him . Together . Uh-huh . I know how painful this can be . The vestiges of our old feelings . they don 't always disappear as quickly as we would like them to . But soon they will . And what you really care about of your many children you 'll give us . We believe that you will be the mother of a brand new generation . The world as humans have known it will be changed ... forever . We 've been waiting for you for a long , long time . And finally ... we have you .

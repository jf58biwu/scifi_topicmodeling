 Narrator : Previously on helix ... It 's not narvik . It 's some sort of infection , bacterial , viral , or fungal . 30 years ago , a chain of events was set in motion . The txm-7 pandemic began here on this island . St. Germain . This is the back-end of nowhere , So you 'll have to wait until another ship can pick you up . Figure two weeks . I understand certain things now . Alan : Look at his hand . Sarah : What does it mean ? Run like hell . ( groaning ) That 's a punji trap . It 's used to catch humans . Oh , my god ! Look ... You should know you 're trespassing on private property . You need to come with us . Why ? The island is dangerous and we can offer you shelter . Brother michael provides for the safety Of our physical as well as spiritual lives . Welcome . In the spirit of generosity with which i know you offer it . I 'm looking for a man named alan farragut . He 's here . But you may not like what you find . Where is she ? Ilaria is everywhere . You think alan farragut really blew up that building in paris ? I haven 't seen alan farragut in a year . Thank you . ( birds chirping ) ( bells tolling ) Where is she ? Where is she ? Where is she ? I don 't know . Where is she ? I don 't know ! I have something you want . Left pocket . ( speaking french ) ( neck cracking ) ( computer beeping ) Brother jerome . Brother carson . I told michael that you wanted to join the harvest group . I , uh , hope i didn 't overstep . Michael always says , " to each his own path . " When you 're done here , come join us in the orchard . Thank you . ( children laughing ) ( sniffing ) ( bells tolling ) Alan ? Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! ( indistinct chatter and laughing ) Alan ? Alan ! Wait ... Wait ! Wait ! ( footsteps approaching ) ( objects clattering ) What are you looking for ? A shovel . For what ? To dig up alan farragut 's grave . He left something for me . Like what ? Only one way to find out . The dead should rest . He 's rested enough . It 's time for him to get back to work . Thanks for so many of you coming to council today . I know sometimes i get so wrapped up in my world I forget the promises that i made to each of you when you arrived . The promise that i would be nothing for myself , Everything for each of you . And more time for us . It 's very hard , what we do here . We 've left a world Where all we ever did was give in To other people 's demands , their ideas For who we are . ( congregation murmuring agreement ) A world where We measured ourselves By other people 's approval . It 's not easy Leaving all of that behind . We surrendered ourselves To a simple life , And by the loss of the self ... We became truly individuals . We are free To simply ... Be . Say it with me , rob . I am . I am . You 're what ? Nothing . I just am . That 's right . You surrender and you just are . Thanks , rob . ( applause ) ( boy coughing ) Mother ? ( congregation gasping ) Mother ? Where are you , mother ? ( shocked murmuring ) Where are you ? Soren ... Soren ! ( soren yelling ) Ow ! Get him off ! Soren , stop ! ( congregation clamoring ) Get him off ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Somebody help her ! ( mother sobbing ) Soren : Let me go ... Sarah : He 's all right , he 's all right . Just don 't move . ( theme music playing ) Peter , the pathogen is here . It 's in the abbey . What ? Who ? A child . A boy . He was exhibiting all the same symptoms That we saw on the boat . He should be in a bsl-3 quarantine . We gotta lock this place down , now . We 're all here . Good ! Good . Sit , sit . Please . Dr. Jordan . I wasn 't expecting to see you in council hall this morning . She disobeyed your orders . The punishment is expulsion . Michael : I 'm aware of the policy regarding skeptics , ann . But she kept olivia 's injuries from getting a whole lot worse . Michael , as i 've told our guests , We don 't tolerate intrusion from the outside world . And ordinarily i would agree . But i think we all know that there 's something amiss here . The boy , soren ... He 's very sick , isn 't he ? Yes , he is . And he 's not the only one . I saw a man this morning , infected , same symptoms . An adult male , late 20s ... Brother isaac . You knew ? Dr. Jordan , i 'm sorry , But we live on an island that 's 400 miles From the nearest fast food joint . We 've got no convenience stores , No antidepressants , no world wide web . We 're completely self-sufficient And we take care of our own , Which is why i 'm not very good at asking for help . But ... I 'm doing that now . Dr. Farragut , if we give you our complete cooperation , Do you think you can find this disease , get rid of it ? We 're not equipped for containment . We expected to observe and take samples . Well , what if you had the right equipment ? Coast guard won 't be back for two weeks , So unless you have a helicopter hidden somewhere ... No , we don 't . But we do have a pretty well-equipped botany lab . The equipment is not exactly current , But it would be at your disposal . We 'll need a lab of our own , As well as a secure quarantine for any infected patients . Ann , see that our friends get everything they need . Of course . Our biggest concern right now is containment . So we need to find this brother isaac immediately . If this illness gets off this island , We could be facing a major pandemic . We 'll set up search teams . Whatever you need . Please help us figure out a way to stop this . ( shovel clanking ) Oh , hold it , i hit something . You found what you were looking for ? No ... Why not ? Because this isn 't alan farragut . ( grunting ) Gently , gently . It 's okay , soren . Gently ... It 's okay , soren , it 's okay . It 's okay . We 're going to help you . Peter : The last person to see isaac Said he was headed down to the basement . Everybody stay on your toes . We 're going in circles . ( sighs ) Wanna split up ? Cover twice as much ground that way . Twice as likely to get lost . Your call , boss . You , you , with me . Mmm-hmm . Man : Yes , sir . Stay sharp . He could be anywhere . Leave ! You 're not allowed here ! I 'll kill you ! ( grunting ) The hell did he go ? ( door opening ) Did you find isaac ? More like he found us . He , uh ... He got away . He could be anywhere by now . This place is riddled with underground tunnels . Huh ! Haven 't seen a monocular microscope in a while . Like , ever . Wow , you 've been out of the field way too long . What 's with all this equipment ? Tell me , why does a cult need a botany lab ? Part of michael 's grand design ? Let 's just focus on what we know . You have the samples from the infected boy ? Blood , urine , and buccal swabs , and skin lesions , too , In the event that we can find a biopsy kit . How long until you can analyze them ? Back in seattle , two hours . Here ... At least 20 . Okay . Um ... I , uh ... I , uh ... I 've been trying to think of a way to tell you this Where you wouldn 't freak out , but ... Alan 's here . Alan 's where ? He 's on the island , he 's ... He 's dressed up like one of the followers . That 's ridiculous ! Look , i saw him this morning outside my window , And then i saw him again . I saw him again in the council hall when soren attacked his mother . But that makes no sense ! I don 't know , peter , But maybe it has something to do with ilaria . Why would ilaria be interested In some crackpot isolationist cult , And why would my brother be investigating it ? I 'd be surprised if he 's here for the food . This isn 't a joke . He has been discredited by the cdc . And don 't forget about the international arrest warrants . Whatever he 's doing here , we are to have no contact with him . But it 's alan , peter , he can help ... No contact , sarah ! Everything okay , doc ? Yeah , just a procedural question . Let 's get back to work . Michael : There 's nothing to worry about . As soon as they get what they 've come for , they 'll leave . Ann : But others will follow . We should expel them now . Well , nothing to find ... So nothing to fear . Is there ? It 's the disruption they cause . All these women ... My grandmother , her mother , and her mother before her , All the way back to the beginning ... We all knew what we had to protect . They 've entrusted me with their legacy . I can 't let them down . ( sighing ) sweet ann ... Well ... Always looking at the big picture . But the boy , soren , And isaac , They 're both very sick . All the more reason To find isaac And cooperate with the doctors . Right ? ( clanging ) ( scratching ) ( loud scraping ) ( muffled snarling ) Isaac ? ( choking ) ( bees buzzing ) Child : Hi , brother landry ! Hello . Afternoon , brother . Man : Afternoon , brother . Jerome ? Michael asked if you 'll join him . After the picking ? He wants to see ya now . Islander : I don 't understand it . This isn 't him ? Julia : Not all of him , anyway . The bones are from more than one person . The skull 's from a woman . A lot of people died on this island years ago . It 'd be easy to mix ' em up . Julia : Not alan . He never did anything without a purpose . Dead or alive , there is a clue here . Uh ... That 's weird . You see the ilium ? The hip bone ? What about it ? Most people have two fused together . This guy 's got three . Does this mean anything to you ? Afraid not . I , uh ... I gotta go . Where are you going ? Check my traps . ( door opening ) Ah ! Jerome . Glad you could come by . Would you like a cup of tea ? No , thank you . It 's purple oolong . Created it myself , right here . Crafted a mount kenya varietal with a chinese leaf . Goes down easy . You 're a geneticist ? I 'm an observer of intertwining fates . At any of the seven taxonomic ranks , Plants create new forms , Hence the massive number of species . And you 're just helping create a few new ones ? Nothing that wouldn 't occur naturally . Only at random . Random ... Yes . Mmm . " what a book a devil 's chaplain might write " on the clumsy , wasteful , blundering " and horribly cruel work . " Charles darwin said that . He didn 't much care for slow or random . Spoken like a man who knew him personally . Nothing is random , jerome . Every path is created , Sometimes by outside forces . But there is not a random atom to be found Anywhere in the known universe . So everything has a purpose ? No , jerome . Everything has a reason . You 've been here for three months . It 's time to answer the fundamental question . Why did you come here ? Find my true path . Ah . So you randomly chose my order ? There 's more to it than that . I 've done terrible things . Taken ... Lives . My choices for self-discovery were ... Limited . So you 're hiding ? Aren 't all of us hiding here ? Even you ? No , we 're not hiding here . We confront our past To put it behind us . We embrace our faults to learn to love them . We face our pain to be released from it . When you start facing your pain , jerome ... Only then will your healing begin . ( sighing in exasperation ) ( sighing ) ( school 's out by alice cooper playing ) Peter : What the hell are you doing ? I 'm isolating the pathogen . Without your safety gear ? Look , peter , i can work twice as fast without my gear on . What if kyle walks in here instead of me And sees you working on a bsl-3 hot agent like that ? Everyone who gets this disease dies ! You know it won 't affect me , And we need to be using every advantage we can right now . And how do we explain it ? I am telling you ... No . You don 't have the right to tell me what i can do . I am the only one who has the right ! And you 've been fighting that ever since they made me team leader . I know you think it should be you . No , actually , peter , i don 't want to be team leader . Then why do you oppose every order i give ? I 'm not allowed to think ? Alan welcomed other people 's input . Alan is not in charge here ! Obviously . I decide who we talk to , who we trust , who we confide in . If you have a problem with that , let me know . If we have to , we will work without you . ( door opening ) Come quick . Peter : What 's wrong ? Better see for yourself . Hey , soren . How you feeling ? Good , i guess . Where 's my mom ? Kyle : His vitals are normal , he 's coherent , his symptoms are clearing . Six hours ago , he was having a paranoiac seizure . No memory of it whatsoever ? Let me talk to him . Hey , soren . Hi . You really scared us . I did ? Yeah . Do you remember anything about this morning ? No , not really . I had a really bad headache , though . Yeah . Looks like this guy had a really bad headache too . You wanna talk about his headache ? He 's just a toy . He doesn 't get headaches . And anyway , he wouldn 't remember either . Maybe some form of anterograde amnesia ? We won 't know what it is until we can build A full clinical profile of whatever the hell this is . Any luck finding isaac ? No , and we 're quite concerned . Brother landry thinks he may have gone outside the gate . Thought you said that was dangerous , what with all the wolves and such ? We take his disappearance very seriously . As soon as we find him , we 'll let you know . We can get started without isaac . We just have to establish a connection between him and soren . Were they eating together , were they drinking from the same water source , Where were they when they were each exposed to the pathogen ? Dr. Jordan . Sarah ... Oh , sh ... It 's just a nosebleed . I 'm fine . Okay . We 'll keep soren here , under observation . Just because he 's asymptomatic doesn 't mean he 's cured . Sister , is it possible to retrace isaac and soren 's steps Over the last few days , see if we can find a point of intersection ? We follow a daily schedule of work and counseling . Even the children are expected to comply . Okay . I 'll talk to olivia , You two map the infected patients movements . Whatever this is , it 's hot and it 's on the move . So this is where isaac worked ? Yes . Do the children ever come down here ? No . Your , uh , trees ... They look like cortlands or paula reds ... You know your apple cultivars . How many children live here ? Nearly 30 , including the babies . Classes are held every day after council hall . They all sleep in the same place ? And eat together as well . Do they get mom and dad time ? Until they 're 7 . After that , we 're all moms and dads , So the kids choose elders to help them find their path . A little young to be making those kinds of decisions , no ? You have a closed mind for a scientist . When can i talk to soren ? Is he going to be okay ? You 'll be able to be with him soon . Did soren do anything different in the last few days ? Anything out of his routine ? I don 't see soren for most of the day . He 's either with the other children or receiving counseling . Counseling ? Instructions from the minders . We don 't have punishments here . We help each other to realize our individual wants and needs . You get a lot of new arrivals ? Some , But most people have been here for generations . What about you ? Island born and bred . Our apples are designed to withstand the abuses of man and nature . Insects , disease , poor weather and soil ... " designed " ? Like gmos ? Oh , nothing so fancy . We follow the old ways . Sarah : You 're grafting . You 're combining different traits from different strains of fruit . Peter : Do you know a man named isaac ? I know him , yes . Do you ever consider leaving ? Why would i do that ? See the world , meet new people ... What can you people offer me that i can 't get right here ? Never know until you give it a try . Do you mind if i take a few bark and soil samples ? I don 't see how that could hurt . Both he and your son fell ill at the same time . Could he have passed the illness on to soren , or vice versa ? Children are never alone with the adults . The children are never alone . Come . I want to show you something . What , uh ... What did you want to show me ? What do you want to see ? Or maybe ... You can show me . Show you what ? What you people have . What my family on the island doesn 't . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , now . Show me . Show me . Be my path . Be my path . Stop it . Mmm ... Stop it . Stop ! I have to get back to my work . Do you have any other questions ? Um ... Nope . Um ... Can i speak to one of your pickers ? If you must . But be brief . Excuse me . I 'm dr . Sarah jordan . Can i speak with you , brother ... Jerome . Of course . I just wanted to thank you for your help earlier , with the boy . Most people would have been too scared . I don 't want to see him hurt ... Or see him hurt anyone . Right , there 's enough violence in the world . We can both agree to that . Sister , may we have a word ? ( whispering ) you need to get out of here now , today . Alan , what are you doing here ? Get peter and the other guy and get the hell out . I can 't . Even if i wanted to , the coastguard won 't be back for another two weeks . Then you go down to the dock and wait , And pray you make it off this island alive . Why ? What 's going on ? Alan , tell me ! What 's going on ? Is everything all right ? Alan : I 'd like to get back to work . What do these carvings mean ? They don 't mean anything . Then why 'd you run out of here as soon as you saw them ? You say you want to stop an outbreak . How do i know you 're telling the truth ? You don 't . Then why should i believe you ? Because i don 't have time to lie . It 's getting worse . How long do you have ? I don 't know . Days , maybe . Then why bother ? Because the other choice is doing nothing , and that 's unacceptable . It 's a map ... Of the island . What 's this right here ? A place you don 't want to go . And neither do i . I have to go . Then you 're not coming back . Why not ? What 's there ? Why would he give me that sign if he didn 't think we were in danger ? I don 't know , sarah . Why does alan do anything ? Maybe he wants us to regroup , wait for the coastguard . Maybe we 're standing in his way of killing someone else . Peter , he 's telling us to run . I don 't care what he 's telling us . We 're the cdc . We don 't run . Sounds like something alan would say . Come on , dr . Sommer 's due to meet us in the lab . So this is what i 've been able to piece together . Everyone 's tightly scheduled here . Work , eat , sleep ... Plus a healthy helping of new-age philosophy . No one goes anywhere randomly . Doesn 't look like isaac and the kid were around each other at all . So how were they the only two that got sick ? I don 't know . Maybe compromised immune systems ? No , soren 's t-cell count was off the chart . The kid 's as healthy as a horse . So what are we talking about here ? Twenty-seven victims on that boat but only two on the island . One missing , one asymptomatic But possibly contagious as hell . Doesn 't make sense . Olivia got pretty rattled when i brought up isaac , Swore soren had never been with him alone . You think she 's lying ? Someone is . We need to find out who . Julia : How much farther ? At this pace , you won 't get there till tomorrow . Tomorrow ? This terrain isn 't the friendliest . Pretty easy to get lost . You could always come with me . Take you as far as the river ... Then you 're on your own . My god ! This was a child . Predation marks on the bones . Animals must have gotten to him . Or something worse . You can 't be in here ! I have to talk to you . Sarah ... It 's after curfew . If anyone catches you ... Alan , the pathogen is on the island . That boy this morning , he was infected . That 's why i 'm here , sarah . You have to go . Did you know that 27 people were killed on a ship 12 miles out ? It got off the island . Yeah . We don 't know how it spread or how to stop it , But now that you 're here , you can help us figure this out . I 've already ... No , i can 't help you . Why not ? Alan , what the hell happened to you ? You disappeared , you quit the cdc , There 's rumors about bombings in paris ... I can 't explain it right now . I thought you were dead . I had no idea what happened to you And then i finally find you And you won 't even tell me anything ! Sarah , i can 't ! It 's too dangerous ... For you and for the team ! You have to trust me . This island is not what it seems . You have to take the others and go . Now ! No . You owe me an explanation . And you owe our baby . Our ... What ? Are you saying we have a child ? No , alan . There 's no child . I 'm so sorry ... There 's no child because i 'm still pregnant . I 've been pregnant for the last 15 months . I don 't understand . How ... I was already pregnant when i received julia 's spinal fluid . I became immortal , stopped aging , And so did the fetus . Jesus ... You know , i thought that my pregnant girlfriends Were exaggerating about the first trimester . But , um ... After 15 months of fatigue And morning sickness and nose bleeds ... You know , i thought about terminating , And i probably should have , but ... Something always stopped me . So ... Here we are . ( footsteps walking by ) I wanna help . I do , but ... But i can 't . You have to leave here now . For your safety and the baby 's . No , i 'm ... I 'm not going anywhere until you tell me why you 're here . I can 't . What i have to do is too important . Shh ... ( whispering ) don 't be afraid , soren . What 's wrong ? Is my mom okay ? Better than okay . She wants to see you ! Really ? But ... What about curfew ? It 's okay ... Just this one time . My mom 's outside of the wall ? She 'll be here in a minute . ( leaves rustling ) ( twigs snapping ) You hear that ? That was her . Are you sure ? ( chuckling ) more than sure . It 's okay . I promise . ( gate opening ) landry ... Landry , what are you doing ? Hello . Soren : No ! ( screaming ) ( theme music playing )

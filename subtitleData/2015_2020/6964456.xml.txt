 It 's my responsibility . No . It 's my responsibility . I created her . But it 's a match for Bill Martin 's blood type . Do you think that 's the murder weapon ? It could be . Why would this woman want to frame Isabella ? Shall we have dinner ? There 's one or two errands I need to run though . - Winter . He just released Isabella . - What ? ! I know you 're here ! Come on Harry . Come on . My God ! My God ! - NO ! - No , he 's dead . Don 't scream ... Don 't scream ! Just give me what you 've got and I leave you alive . I 've got nothing . What 's this ? ! Leave me alone . Hand it over ... now . Do you want it ? It 's yours . - Harry ! Harry ! - Shocking . Clear . Can you hear me , Harry ? - Harry ! - We need to get him to the hospital . Harry , stay with us , alright ? It 's alright . It 's alright , Harry . Harry . Hey , it 's me . Erm , you 're thirty minutes late I just hope you 're alright ? - Hi . - Hi . I 'm sorry . I thought maybe something might 've happened . No , it 's the Dalston Soup Kitchen . It 's a ... a madhouse . It 's fine . I 'm just glad you 're alright . Hum ! What have you been doing ? Cooking ? It smells great . I just wanted to say sorry for what happened . I could tell ... You know , I should never have allowed your arrest . It 's alright . You mean a lot to me and err , I just hope you can forgive me . It 's work , I 'm sorry . Yeah . God ... Where is he ? Alright ! Well I , I , I 'll be right there . It 's one of my officers , Harry Clayton . He 's had a serious accident . - I 'm sorry I gotta go . - Yeah go . Go . No Jay , Jay , Jay ... I got something . Ready ? Nathan , it 's not moving ! I 'm trying ! SHIT ! So now , I can 't even pawn it . And I 've gotta get publicly beaten wearing ... jewellery ! - Well , I 'll fight instead . - What ? C 'mon , I go in , I take a few punches , we get the money , - pay the debt . - No . Jay , you nearly died last time . And you think I 'm gonna let my little brother risk it ? We both know mum would 've beaten me to a pulp for not looking after you . Alright ? Besides , who knows ? Odds might go in my favour for a change . What , like , you might go down in the second round , instead of the first ! Think he 's waking up . Suri , go and get Anna . Harry ? Harry , can you hear me ? If this is heaven , it 's not what it 's cracked up to be ! It 's okay everyone , he 's still an arse . I thought you were dead , you scumbag . - Sorry to disappoint you . - Dad ! Daisy ... Dad , I was so worried about you ! Hello . Daise , shall we go get something to eat ? Get you something too if you like . Great , the third date vending machine . Err , I was so afraid the paramedics wouldn 't get there in time . You saved my life . You need saving . - It 's gone ! - It 's gone ! Sorry ... No , don 't worry , Alistair , come in . Come in . I 'll go and find Daisy . God ! I 'm glad you 're still alive . I really thought ... Alistair ... What happened wasn 't an accident . Isabella tried to kill me . What are you talking about ? I know it 's the last thing you want to believe . But last night she came to shut me down for good . If Anna hadn 't been there , she 'd've done the job . Harry , Harry , you 've been through an ordeal . Your head 's in a mess ... No , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , but I 'm crystal clear . They 've been others too . The criminals on our list ; She 's the one taking them out . What the hell is wrong with you ? First you arrest my girlfriend with deficient evidence , and now this ! We were involved ! What are you saying ? Isabella and I knew each other long before you did . When I broke it off , she turned psychotic . That 's why she 's targeted you . No , you , you 're lying . Look at me ! Look ! Look where I am . I maybe a lot of things , but I 'm not that cruel and I am not insane . So why else would I tell you this ? Please , Alistair , please ... Get yourself ... Back on your feet . Listen Al , Alistair ! Stay away from her ! Shit . You 're ... still here . Yes , I thought I 'd wait for you after that call . Thought it might be a rough night for you . Thanks . Do you wanna talk about it ? Harry Clayton was electrocuted last night . That is terrible .. What a terrible way to die . How did that happen ? I mean , was it in the line of duty ? Or an accident ? We 're looking into it . God . I 'm sorry . You know , when you say ' weapon ' , people think of a knife or a gun . But a glass shard can be just as lethal . Why are you here ? I didn 't want to kill Harry . But he made it impossible for me not to . Where 's the other bracelet ? I destroyed it . You 're lying . You 're the one who told me to destroy yours if you died . Why would you do that ? Because look what it 's done to you ! You just murdered the best man I ever knew . And you can kill me , Isabella , it won 't change the fact you 're alone now . For good . Leave town . If I see you , I will kill you . Harry ... Harry ... You 're dead . You 're dead . You 're dead . Isabella ... She killed me . But I came back again . Shouldn 't you be in the hospital ? Probably . You going somewhere ? Isabella came by ; She told me to get out of town . She thinks you 're dead ... Has she seen you ? No , but it 's only a matter of time . Where 's the bracelet ? Eve , where 's the bracelet ? I ... did something stupid . Come on , Jay ... Come on Jay , you got him . You got this . Finish him ! And tonight , our winner , Jay Tate ! Jay Tate ! But ... What happened to Harry was an accident . Investigating Harry 's crash is purely a precautionary measure . Just examine the site , liaise with the Serious Collision . Investigation Squad , make sure we 're not missing anything . Okay , we 'll visit the scene , go to the impound . Thanks . And Suri ? Please treat this with the utmost confidentiality . Let 's give Harry his recovery time . Sure . Can you get me a printout of all the cases Harry Clayton investigated over the last three months . Thanks . According to the report , there was a leak in Harry 's brake fluid reservoir . In there , see that ? Time of the accident , this thing was pretty much empty . Could that have caused the crash ? Hard to say . Would have stopped him avoiding it . What caused the leak ? It 's natural abrasion , in older vehicles . But the report says there 's no way of telling how or when it happened . But Harry just had that car serviced . Wouldn 't they have spotted it ? So that 's it , it 's all paid off ? Yeah . Anything we make from here on out goes straight to the bank of Jay . Lucky for you , the bank covers its brother too . Tate ? You there ? You was on form last night . Been eating my greens , I guess . I 've got another club tonight . Big league . You feel like stepping up ? - Yeah . - Good lad . - Barman . Another . - Uhuh ? You celebrating ? Or mourning ... A little of both . I just lost my only companion . My last bit of hope in this world . Well , you know the best way to get over someone ? Get under someone-else . You get me , ahahah . I 'm having a very bad day . Leave me alone . - Sorry about that . - Thanks . That was rude . I thought I made myself very clear . Yeah . I 've had a real fucker of an evening . So why don 't you lose the resting bitch face and make this fun for us . Yeah . Fine . Argh ! My eyes . Argh ! Argh ! My eye 's argh ! Help me , please , somebody help ! Dave , you got to come and see this kid , dodges like he 's a mind reader . You think our mugger 's here ? Regular fighters are marked with a horseshoe tattoo on their thumb . He had one . Contestants get paid to enter cause they might not come out . - Alright , Rory . - Alright . Long time no see . Can we watch ? Of course . Your mate looks a little soft . Keep an eye on him . Tattoos . You know the guy in the green shorts ? Yeah , Jay Tate . Usually on his back in minutes , he 's suddenly got cocky . Look at him , thinks he 's Tyson Fury . Tonight 's winner , Jay Tate ! Jay Tate ! Jay Tate ! Tate ! Tate ! Tate ! - Sir ? - How 'd it go ? Crime scene was err , nasty , but as the report suggested . Poor driving conditions , fallen pylon cable , Harry was just unlucky to be the path of least resistance . Nothing to suggest foul play there . - But ? - Well , there was one thing . Erm , a leak in the brake fluid container of Harry 's car . When he was out that night , he was essentially driving without brakes . Do we know how it got there ? No . But we know it 's recent . Harry had the car serviced two months ago . I checked the vehicle report , there was no leak then . - Doesn 't tell us much . - No , it doesn 't . But ... Being there at the scene , adding up all these weird factors ... Something just doesn 't feel right . Here are , just like I said . And there 's plenty more where that come from , alright ? Bit more than an entrance fee , ain 't it ? - Tate . Congratulations . - Thank you . Against all the odds ? Some serious brass balls on you . Or is it something else ? Who are you ? DI Clayton . I 'm the last person to wear what 's on your wrist . You can feel it then . Piss off , mate . It 's intoxicating , I get it . Everything is going your way , feels invincible . But there are consequences . - What 's he on about ? - Later ... Listen to me . Every time something lucky happens to you , something bad follows . Listen to me ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Stay down . Stay down ! Five , five , five thous , five thousand . Five thousand . Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck ! We are gonna be rolling in it , bruv . Seriously , I reckon I can beat anyone now . Yeah . You don 't reckon that copper 's gonna come after us ? I reckon he won 't be able to catch us . Oi , mate ! What 're you doing ? He 's a pretty boy , ain 't he ? I 'm talking about the car , not you . Can I help you ? Yeah . You can give me your keys . Jay , people can see ! I 'm just talking nice to the fella . You don 't want to make trouble with me . No . I want you to hand over the car without a fuss . Alright , I warned you ... Jay ! Jay , Jay ! - Stop it ! Somebody help ! - Jay , what are you doing man ? Get off him ! - Jay , man ! - Give me the key ! What are you doing , man ? Jay . Jay . What are you doing ? Get in the car , Nathan . Who the hell did you just mug ? Jesus ! You didn 't have to do it , you didn 't have to be there tonight . There 's nothing tying us together anymore , you can just walk away . I know how much you hated wearing the bracelet . Really ? You 're a funny thing . Eve , that guy is carrying a curse he doesn 't even realise is on him . However much of a dickhead Jay is , the bracelet 's our responsibility . Not yours , Harry . I 've worn it . I 've seen what it can do to a man . It 'll always be my responsibility . And you really don 't know where he is ? Anna , I am doing everything in my power to keep him safe . But you know what Harry 's like . Let 's go back . So the car swerved off the road , that 's when Harry got out ? Yes . It 's when the cable electrocuted him . Any other details ? Anything out of the ordinary ? Shouldn 't you be asking Harry these questions ? Anna , if there 's something you know , you have to tell me . Harry said you were dating Isabella Augustine . Why do you bring that up ? Because before I say anything , I need to know where she fits in to all of this . With you . Yes , we 've been involved . But ... I 'm currently assessing the nature of our relationship . There was a car tailing us that night . Alright . Did you get a look at it ? License plate , model , anything ? It was a black four by four . Who was it , Anna ? Find out where Isabella was the night of the accident . Be careful , Alistair . Why didn 't you tell me you knew Harry Clayton ? What do you mean ? Harry told me , just before the accident , said you knew each other from Gamblers ' Anonymous . Well , we 're not supposed to disclose any information about other members , under any circumstances . But there you go ! Well , I didn 't even know you had a gambling problem . I don 't . I did , but not anymore . Honestly , Alistair , that is all in the past ... Harry and I barely spoke . We didn 't really know each other . You could have said something that night . Apart from the discretion code , it didn 't really feel like the appropriate moment to talk about all this . When you just had that call about the accident . Okay . Thanks . Actually ... We 're not so sure it was an accident . A man who lives opposite saw the whole thing . Spotted a vehicle pulling away , soon after Harry was electrocuted . Struck us as a bit odd . You know , car crashed , Harry on the floor . You 'd have thought they 'd have at least stopped . Yes . That does sound odd . It 's probably nothing , but we 're gonna bring him in , interview him for a vehicle description . Anyway , look , sorry . I 'm banging on about work . It 's good to see you . - Coffee . - Yeah . Woohoo ... What do you say , Nath ? You still weeping over your lost morals ? Right , so you 're just gonna sit there resenting me . Even though I 'm the one paying for all this shit . I 'm the one with the plan , the cash , the talent ... I mean , what do you actually bring to the table , Nath ? Y 'know , I used to think I was just looking out for you . But you know what the term is for someone like you ? Leech ! You know what ? There . Think of it as ' fuck off ' money . What ? I don 't need that rain cloud over your head pissing all over me . Go on . Get lost . You know what , Jay , you always were a prick . But you used to be a good brother . Mum 'll be turning in her grave right now ! Funny how luck changes someone , isn 't it ? Right , give us some space , go on ! Quickly . Move ! Move ! - Thank you ! - How 'd you find me ? - Your brother called me . - What ! ? You 're losing it , Jay ! Alright , you need help , mate ! So you enlist a flipping copper , you idiot ? I 'm not here to arrest you . I want you to stop using the bracelet , before it 's too late . You seriously still selling me that comic book shit ? Okay . - Find the Queen of Hearts . - What ? Just do it . If it 's not there I 'll leave . - No way ... - Jack of Diamonds . It 's obviously a trick deck . - Name a card . - Eight of Clubs . Pick one . I told you . It 's the bracelet . No . It 's not . - Jay ... - You can feel it . Every since you started wearing it , how everything changed . You 're addicted already . It 's not the flipping bracelet , alright ! ? Jay . My head really hurts ... This is all just some big fucking con ! I 'm having my first good run in years , I 'm not about to let - some Celtic tosser ruin it ! - I 'm just trying to help you , mate . - Jay . My head doesn 't feel right ... - Just stay the hell away from me . - Jay ! - You alright ? Nathan ! Nathan . What are you doing ? Nathan ? Nathan ? Nathan ? He is not breathing ! Nathan ! What are you doing in here ? These are Harry 's old files . - This is private . - Why are you looking at them ? D 'you think they have something to do with what happened to Harry ? I saw you talking to Anna Clayton earlier . Please sir , if someone 's trying to hurt Harry , you have to tell me about it . I can 't discuss this . Not yet . Where are you going ? Sir , what the hell is going on ? You watch your tone , Suri . Remember who 's in charge here . Look , I 'm , I 'm sorry . I 'll explain everything tomorrow . Thank you . Thanks for all your help . What was that about ? I don 't know . But I 'm officially done being kept in the dark . - What are you doing ? - Enlisting a grass . What are we gonna do with him ? I 'm working on it . But tell you , we 're not gonna abandon him . Can 't become like Isabella . How you holding up ? How the hell could he have had a brain aneurysm ? Nathan 's twenty one . He don 't even drink , he 's healthy . I don 't think it works like that . So you 're not messing with me , are you ? You really believe this is a lucky bracelet . I know it sounds a complete bollocks . But the sooner you start believing it , the more you 'll be able to protect yourself . So , so Nathan dying ... that 's really cos of me ? The luck has to balance itself out . That 's why we need to teach you all we can . Before you lose anything else . I 've got nothing left to lose . _ Excuse me . Harry . Suri ? That 's right . Got fed up of you dodging my calls . Suri . This is not a good time . We 've been investigating what happened to you . Winter sent us to the crime scene , and I saw him talking to Anna earlier . I don 't think he believes it was an accident and now he 's left the office and won 't say where he 's going . Listen to me . Track his phone , send me his destination . Harry 's medicine 's dealing with it . This is mine . When things started going right , I thought I was finally getting a silver lining for all the shit I 'd gone through . But this , this thing . It ain 't a reward , is it ? It 's a punishment . You put it on me . Take it off . I 've tried ... It won 't budge . Please . I can 't be this person anymore . Take it off . I 'm sorry , I can 't , it won 't come off . What you talking about ? The bracelet stays with you till the day you die . I 'm sorry I can 't change that . I really hoped you wouldn 't come . There isn 't a witness that lives opposite . You tricked me . I 'm afraid I did . It didn 't occur to me at first . The fact that Harry accused you of murder , and that very same night he wound up in a tragic accident . I was vindicated of that charge . Yeah . And I believed you . But I 've been in this job a long time . You stop being able to ignore your gut . And I just couldn 't shake it off . The way everything seemed to line up so neatly to make sure Harry died . The leak . The accident . Falling cable . And you know what the strangest thing was ? It extended to his cases too . All of these criminals dying in the most mysterious circumstances . - Bad luck . - I don 't believe in luck . C 'mon ... C 'mon , Alistair , pick up ... - Please leave a message after the tone . - Bollocks ! Suri , tell me ? I 've got him , Seventeen West Walk , Latimore Road . That 's the road where I died . Yeah , I know . Why would Winter go there ? I think he 's in serious trouble . Suri , get back-up ! Where did you get that ? After I met you and Harry at the fight club , I needed a quick getaway . Like magic , this , this Porsche pulls up . Found this in the glove compartment . I thought I was on a fucking roll . Everything I wanted just kept appearing . But Nathan ... Na , Nathan , he cottoned on to it . He told me to stop . Only , he 's the one who got punished 'cause I wouldn 't stop . Jay ... Please put the gun down . You did this to me . You put it on my fucking wrist . You knew what was gonna happen . I know , I ... made a mistake . Will the bracelet bring Nathan back ? Will the bracelet bring Nathan back ? No ! No , I 'm sorry ... N , No . Please , Jay , don 't . Please don 't . I 'm sorry for what I did to you . No ! Where were you the night of the accident ? I already told you . Right . The soup kitchen . You see , I called them , and they didn 't have an event that night . In fact , they have no record of any volunteer named Isabella Augustine . And there was something else . Anna Clayton saw a car following her . All the way from their house , to the scene of the accident . Harry was electrocuted by a pylon cable . What do other cars have to do with that ? Maybe nothing . But she remembers what the vehicle looked like and she could probably identify it if requested . Was that your car , Isabella ? You 'd never put someone away with that . You 're probably right . I just wanted to know for myself , if you were involved . And now I do . When I met you , I thought you must 've been ... sent . I spent so long wishing for you . And now I know who you are . And I will see to it that you 're brought to justice for what you 've done . If you confess now , your sentencing will be more lenient . If not , rest assured we 'll find the evidence to put you away for a long time . Goodbye , Isabella . Alistair . It 's such a shame , we could have parted so amicably . So who 's next ? If I kill her , I lose . If you don 't , we all lose . I want SO19 . Men on the streets . A cordon round her house . And I have to be there . We have no chance of catching her unless I am there . We have to get Daisy . She is going to come for you . You have to suffer , Harry Clayton . Lose everything , so you can see the world as she does . If you had to put your last penny on one person ... Who would it be ? So how will you beat her ? You 've no chance without this .

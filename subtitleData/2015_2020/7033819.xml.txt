 141 years ago , after humanity declared that God had died We were in the middle of the longest winter in the history of mankind . PHOENIX , ARIZONA 2307 300 years of ruthless cold . And it will probably end for another million years . No , until none of us disappears . ARIZONA FEDERATION - POPULATION : 2.109 The only remaining trace of mankind , is 10 meters under the ice . Where the last Thermoelectric pumped life to the remains of our infrastructure . We are the only surviving animals . Looters , still driven by greed . Creators of a synthetic world : The Humanoids . Our children of black blood . Created according to our image . A race of workers and those , who keep . Any hope of peace has long been forgotten , lost time . I see two Noides , fleeing Subterra-3 . - Confirmation of the application . - Confirmation ! Dispatch it ! There is a patrol ! Separate yourself ! Wait , Noids are on the move . Scanning Lost in the trees , disappeared . SEARCHED BY THE ARIZONA FEDERATION PERSON OBJECTIVE : ASH-393 HUMANOID SERIES : SURFACE ARTICA 300 TYPE : HOMINUS FALSA MK9 CRIMES : MURDER , HUMANOID REBELLION LEADER SPARTAN MISSION 7 : 2307 THE WINTER DREAM HUMANOID - THE LAST HUMANITY - 5 YEARS LATER SUBTERRA 2 COMMERCIAL SECTOR Only liars are no longer smiling . They enjoy living when they are extinguished . Even before the animals died . Buried in the tomb of eternal ice . And all the Humanoids-slaves of the world can not bring her back . Life forms us ... Like it or not . It 's the decisions we make in the dark . When we are alone , in our secret place . There we form the world , which surrounds us . And here , at the end of it all , we sit together alone . Caught in our decisions . Desperate for something to save us . I 'm thinking about her , waiting for me on the other side . QVapor the most popular drug in the 24th century . I call her : " The greatest achievement of mankind " Because it 's the only thing that lessens the pain . The only thing that returns it to me . Mara ! ... Mara ! Bishop , I 'm here . I 've never left . Alarm in the sector ! Subject identified ! Spartan-7 deserter Commander Bishop . All AZF officers report immediately in the Subterra 2 trading area . Suspected QVapor overdose and psychosis . Welcome to the Pinky Amusement Park . Here will be the wettest dream come true ! Get in ! Commander Bishop , sir ? - Commander ? - It 's full with Steam , sir ! Hey , idiot ... General Trajano requests your report for the service ! Time to take you home ! Raise it up . OMG ! Commander Bishop , are you all right , sir ? Do not call me " sir " ! Commercial sector 1 , insured . Prepare 51 for Spartan-7 ... Bishop ... It 'll be good to see you again in your uniform , Bishop . Who says I 'm going to put it ? Come on , we both know , you 're not a deserter . Find another , for your murders . You made an oath on Spartan-7 . Take off your uniform , do not remove the promise . Come on , then , arrest me . All my oaths were broken long ago . Sorry for Mara . She was a good woman . It is difficult to deal with such a thing . Especially today . That 's why I brought you here , son . It 's time to get Mara closer . We told you that your baby died . I wish it would have been so . That would be better than the truth . Ash-393 took it from the womb of your broken wife . He took it with him . No one knows where . We could not tell you the truth that time , but ... But if he had left , a Noid kidnapped a human baby ... We would have genocidal panic above our heads . You 're telling me ? ... That my son still lives ? Yes , Bishop . But the most important : We 're giving you a chance to get them back . Find Ash . Then you will find your daughter . My daughter ... Our daughter , Mara ! Five years have passed . How could he survive on the ice for so long ? She does not have improved DNA . Extension of DNA at the end of mitosis sequencing the completed genetic material . No human survives without Iso-Gel one day less than 60 degrees . Could she really be alive ? Alert ! F-7100 to the maximum .. Reprogramming of DNA is complete . Markers identified for strength and healing . I think to resurrect a broken man , I suppose everything is possible . They brought me back , Mara . To the place I never thought to return . Spartan-7 slave police . Ishmael ... What happened brother ? You never came with me for help . Ready for this ? I do not know , Ish . Come on , Commander ! Your team is waiting for you All members of the UCF crew have arrived ... Ash-393 is considered to be the most sophisticated noid ever created by men . A class one surface humanoid 300 Series . It has full AI access . He was the leader of Noid 's rebellion . He was . Is dead . By rumors has many crimes In the Federation of Arizona , He recently arrived in the northeast corridor . The reactor 12 has been turned off . He killed 28 . Hidden by intelligence , it is in the death zone 714 . Hidden in the death zone ? Does not sound very clever The fusion of the nucleus has probably smoothed the brain of the Noids . Or , Commander ? Not as soft as your dick . Revenge is a bitch ... Like you ! What , Kix ? Stop him ! Five years ago I got a team sent to kill Ash . We lost contact here . There temperatures must be subarctic . Your Iso-Gel will last 48 hours . After that your thermal protection will increase by 1 % per hour of exposure . So , do we have four days , before we make ourselves palettes ? You will not need much , son . - One question , General . - What is it , Kix ? What range is recommended for some after freezing . Can I calm him down ? And bury him in the snow ? It has more deaths than you have wet dreams . They are in perfectly capable hands . But that 's a long time ago , General . Before qVapor has fried his gray matter . Commander Bishop you have the floor . Weapon systems what we have ? Each stay in the team art piece in the man Sources of energy , sonar grenades , radon guns . Enough firepower for everyone to melt ice cubes in the death zone ... Know the magnetic field , That the meteor has caused . Why did we ever put electronic weapons there anyway ? Intelligence has new information about the magnetic field in the death zone . Their wrist weapons have been modified and operate within the death zone . I 'd like to order five carabinier rifles . 3,000 cartridges of ammunition And 50 thermal grenades . For backup , sir . I like the sound , Commander . said it used to be one of the hottest deserts on earth ... But 500 miles of radio alive this tundra became " Death Zone 714 " . I guess hell finally froze . Again , search for the needle in the haystack . You just have to love it . I do not understand that . After five years it can be everywhere . Why did they wait so long until they sent us , anyway ? Procrastination is like masturbation : At first it feels good but in the end you just catch yourself . I 've got all the data out , Commander ! I 'm a backup person , nasty killer machine ! I do not need no hand , to kill a Noid . Because you 've never seen one of those things take the man 's arm . You said it ! If so my kill rate goes high , I like that . I know the reports on AI systems . The majority of patients are 10 years after implantation . So you have no problem , you 're wrong . Sorry for all the shit about the death of your wife , sir . Between us , this mission is not about Noids . Is personal . We are his devilish dogs ... And we come back healthy ! Hey Bishop , what are you doing ? Shaving your legs ? If we do not have more energy and your blaster has become shiny black cock What do you do then ? Then I put the bastard in the ass ! I caught something warm , behind the snow . Okay , Kix . - Warm the gun ! - Your best idea so far ! Kix waits for my signal . - You 're the boss , Commander ! - Go to your last team ! I thought this noid could fly . Hatta , do not continue . We need to know , who is under the blanket . I do not want to kill any innocent . This is the Commander Bishop , Spartan-7 Humanoid Command . You are located in the Federation area . In the death zone 714 . What have you lost here ? Under the authorization code of the Federation Z-4711 A report of the genome documentation . You have five seconds to meet . Five four three two one ... ! The target moves , permission to shoot ! Permission denied Kix . We have no idea who he is . We reached it on foot . I 'm going to take his death . Stop the fire , stop the fire , Kix ! That is an order ! Where is the ? Do we have eye contact ? Negative , it 's gone . Damn it , bishop ! I had it in sight . Subutai ! - Subutai ! Salt ! - Is dead ! Commander ! Commander , are you hurt ? Where is Subutai ? Subutai ! Subutai ! ! What the hell ? ! Do not ! My truck ! Damn Noids . Curse ! Look at this shit . Ash scraped the engine and the whole system . For the repair we need a GMM . - A GMM ? " A great damn hammer , you idiot ! " The equipment and the ammunition are ashes ! We are 100 miles from the base . A long way home without snow shoes . Without Ash we 're not going anywhere . The first time I agree with you , Bishop . At the edge of the death zone is a probe with emergency equipment . If we get there , we have a chance . Let 's go hunting again . You do not have to worry about hounding Ash . ... he will hunt us ! The Humanoids were created , ready to serve . They are stronger than we are and manage the weather . They are hairless , His blood is sour and black . They are like mules and can not reproduce . A security measure against genetic competition in the future . Its Creator said : His tranquility rests in Absence of reproduction . But something is different now . The rebellion is spreading . They fight until his death , something to protect . Something to preserve . The blood is fresh , but not human . Let 's find out , he 's at the end of the blood trail . It smells like something big died . Yes , Ash has returned in his suit . Just smell it in your pussy with your breath , Kix . Listen to the talk . Pay attention ! . Okay , we split up Come here , little bird . Come here , come to Dad ! Stop the nonsense ! I have goose bumps here ! Who knows , what is circulating around here . All right , I 'm going in . I 'll cover you . Let 's go for it ! You are dead , Kix Suck me the dick ! What do you think this is , Commander ? Noid art ? Hey friend . Fuck you Fortunately , he is dead . Let 's take a blood sample . Shit ! Hatta ! Hatta ! Shit , I can not aim ! I 'm going out ! Son of a bitch have to pay ! Hey , asshole ! Come ! Get it ! You created the wrong gangster ! I love the taste of black blood in the morning ! The thermal camera did not recognize its pattern . I thought he was dead . The turns of electronics . We are approaching the death zone . You 're good ? Motherfucker ! The electronics are fine , Commander . Well , Kix ! What a sight you have so extreme . I 've never seen a noid with hair . Because they do not grow hair , asshole . Mutated Humanoids . True . - This is a Sammy 69-7-H . - A Sammy 69-7-H ? This is an old model of pleasure , is not it ? They probably lost their virginity , did not they , Hatta ? - Are you cold ? - No sir . Pack it in the tank ! Can you walk on that leg ? Yes . You 're going to make it , brother . Ice teaches all humility . It shows us our limits . Our weaknesses . Our humanity . But in the area of death the ice is ruthless . Looks like someone had your bright idea , Bishop . An accident rarely comes alone . Sauber ! It seems that your drug addicts friends are condemned here , What ? Are we going to play now " Cowboys and the damn Indians " ? Only we are the damned Indians . Everyone knows the damn Indians never win , my friend ! Noids have no combat training . We do . Re-assemble and prepare . Check the Noid for DNA reconfiguration . I 'll contact the base . I say : We hide in the next camp . The next camp is 100 miles from here . We 're dead before we get there . Do not look so serious . I will not let you die . Very well , little one ? Fuck you , Hatta ! Accept the shit . We contacted the enemy right outside the Death Zone . The truck is gone . Subutai has fallen . But we ended up mutated humanoids in the process , So it was a mutated humanoid Ash-393 ? Negative , but it has been hormonally changed . We took a sample for an exam . I do not care about mutated notions . I want Ash-393 ! - I want him dead and disintegrated ! - Roger , General . We continue the search . We need an evacuation group . Ishmael is almost frozen . You must leave here immediately . General ? Can you hear me ? Send an evacuation group . I repeat : Send an evacuation group . Will we stay here all night , or what ? An electromagnetic storm is coming . If we wait , we 'll lose Ash . If we move now , we still have a chance . I can do it , Commander ! Kix , stay with Ishmael , until the storm is over . I 'm not a fucking nanny ! " What were Trajan 's orders ? " - Ash 's going to die . Then I 'll take care of that . I was born to hunt , Commander . The collection team arrives in the morning . All you have to do is stay warm until then . Can you do that for me , Spartan ? I can do it , Commander . Stay strong , brother . See you upstairs . What is it , Kix ? Where 's the fucking bitch with thick balls now ? ! I have your breath hanging right here , Hatta . In this forest ... he pursues you ! - Shit ! - What the hell ... ? Welcome to the area of death . The energies are useless here . Who says it ? The magnetic field . Download charged particles . So Trajan was wrong ? Shit ! I do not give up ! Hatta , let 's flank it . You 're hurt ? Of course not ... I can not say the same thing about Trajan 's partner . Bill Carson . You found old Bill , huh ? He was a Spartan-5 . And a friend . Establish a perimeter , we 'll camp here . And give him a decent funeral . Ash has something special . I have something for him . We walked together , side by side . He waited to see me fall . I never fall I wanted to inoculate his black blood . I 'll find you , Ash ! Because you messed with the wrong gangster ! Why do you always read the same book , Kix ? What makes it so special ? " Men do not perish in the results of lost wars , But the loss of that resistance force Which contains only pure blood . Who are racially pure people and conscious of their blood , He can never be a slave . In this world will always be bastard and bastard alone . Humanoid mutants are fully capable of reproducing different types . That is the only thing that the creator did well . Are you doing something deep , not Kix ? " Does that book teach you all that ? " - Open mind . It helps me understand , what I do . Every single mutant must be exterminated for the human race to survive . Let 's put it as data in the briefcase , Kix . Your psycho propaganda bothered me . Adolf Hitler was an unknown prophet . Your message is our salvation ! You have real damage , Kix . " We will have to fight for the freedom and the independence of the homeland Only in this way can the people fulfill the task , which they received from the Creator . " There is no ' homeland ' anymore . It 's just what we left , that 's all that 's left . The atmosphere was destroyed by us . No one else is to blame . And the asteroid , Bishop ? It was in the crater . I saw it with my own eyes . It looks more like an atomic bomb to me . It was an internal job ... That is always . Humanity is responsible for the eternal winter . Not God , or humanoids . It will no longer be a time hunted by the shadows of your own guilt . It can eradicate parasites . " I 'll be looking for you in the destroyed fields , Bishop . Ok Kix , since you have so much energy tonight why do not you take the first guard ? Have fun with your book . Mara ! Come on , Bishop . Get up , Spartan . There is something in the trees . I 'll send you back to hell ! Yellow-eyed devil ! Bishop ... I 've marked it , Commander . I marked it clearly for you . Bishop , I 'm here . Did you miss the fucking shot ? 10 meters away ? You are the total ruin , man . Did not Trajan take you out of the sewer ? I would be a damned commander ! And my team would still be alive ! Now it 's your turn , Bishop . Alpha , Mike , Foxtrot bye , son of a bitch ! Listen , or you 'll never pull the trigger again . You do not have the eggs . Reckless bitch ! Mara , they were wrong . There is life in the area of death . I will not resign . I will not stop , Before we find our daughter . You are with me my love You 're here with me now . Ash ! Come on , my friend . Calientetate . Hey , everything will be fine ... do not die ! Do you listen ? Calientetate . Returns ! Do not die ! I want to see it again ... last time . I promise ! I swear today until the end of days , I will love you and honor you , if you are with me . I will , now and forever . Stop , before you get hurt ! I 'm Atka . It 's okay . I am here to help you . Let go ! I helped you . Where are my clothes ? How long I was passed out . Not enough . You 're welcome ! Bishop . Bishop ? where we are ? This is Quannik 's house . - Quannik ? - He 's been waiting for you . - As it did ? - He died . Forget this . I have to get back on the road . How can I get out of here ? What are you looking for ? - Death ? - That 's funny . That 's all the Death Zone offers your people . I 'm looking for a man . He is not a man ! His blood is as black as coal ! You know it . I saw how he buried you alive . For him you are dead now . It will not give you more trouble . I stole something . Something very special . What ? My daughter . Is the child yours ? - Little ? - Yeah . But I thought she was one of them . Can you take me with her ? Dangerous , she is protected . Please , Atka . My life is nothing without it . Quannik thought , that the time of red blood soon ends . Soon comes the time of black blood . He lives for 143 years . Many of his visions came true . He said there will be no cure for black blood . Ash is nearby . I can feel his presence . Its smell is lifeless . Your path does not make sense . His traces only exist in the past . Like a ghost hunt . Ghosts have a soul . He does not . From a technical point of view , A mind is a soul . This is not funny , Bishop . I 've seen them kill . Suicide would be the best option . If you 're afraid , ... I get it . Just put me in the right direction and I go alone . We must find Cage . That 's not my style . Not like a hiding place . Cage is a man ! An old and nasty fighter . With many weapons . He lives four days walking , Inside the death zone . No human is so crazy . I did not say , that is not crazy . Come . I know the way Hello , guests . My name is Sara . Sorry , my husband is not there . Will come back later We wait . Cookies , that 's milk . I can see that , Sara . Where do you get them ? I made them , of course . They try my husband better than his mother 's cookies . Did you make the milk ? What the hell is going on here ? You 're a humanoid ! Why do you have hair ? My husband told me that I am the first blonde but unfortunately I am brunette , so Where are you from , Sara ? - I was born in this cabin . - No , that 's impossible ! Tell me the truth . - Where are you from ? - You 're far from home , Spartan ! " Do you want to tell me what you do in my cabin ? " - He 's a friend , Cage . There is no reason for the weapon . With her , I 'll blow your face away ! I 'm looking for a girl . She was kidnapped by a Humanoid . My partner said that maybe you could help me . This is no help for the Spartans . I do not like to waste time with Federation slag . Spartan , my ass ! As I said ... I would appreciate any information you or Sara may have about the girl . You must be five now . If you can not help , let 's go our way again . And we do not ask questions . A gun does not want to help you , son . What if I do not want to help you ? What happens then ? Question answered ? Rat , piece of Spartan garbage ! You and your Indian slut can kiss me in the ass ! You play my wife , you bastard , I 'll kill you and all of you ... Do you have permission to have this Noid mutated ? Delicious breast milk for your cookies ! It 's no noid , it 's Sara . Do not waste it , I 'm too old for the way I like it . - I know where the rebel Noids are . - Where are they ! I traded with them , thinking I would trade enough . Trade with fugitive humanoids ? Maybe you get only 30 years . And old Sara , she should be more than happy to return to the local palaces of pleasure . " And give milk ... for cookies ! " - It 's okay ! I 'll help you ! We have to wait for them at the meeting place . They always arrive at eight . There are only a few kilometers . Okay , biscuit . Daddy 's here now . Is Dad . I will protect you . Have you no manners , son of a bitch ? - Do you have any more weapons ? - Pissing ice balls on the icebergs ? This is all my team , long before your time . Sergeant Ulysses H. Cage , Spartan-3 . Retired after 30 years of service in the field . Be my butt . The Spartans do not retreat . They die like a hero . Or they pee like cowards . Put this piece of gun away and I 'll show you exactly how cowardly I am . Why did you run away then ? In time for the promotion . There were only two of us : I , with 30 years of experience in the field . And this kid from the academy . It was full of extensions . Artificially intelligent implants and so on . There could only be one of us . We treat it the same way . Or your way . I guess the manager was probably good , so ... Trajan son of a bitch ... Trajan became the new commander . And I ... I was thrown out of this garbage . Trajan ? General Trajan ? General ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , well , that suits you . I always knew that son of a bitch would come up easily . At that moment he was so deep in the ass of his superiors , I could smell , what they had for breakfast . Duty calls ! That 's where I meet the Noids right there . Make sure you go straight . The 306 cartridges you have . I do not want to have lead poisoning , Before it 's all over here . Too small for a humanoid . Who you are ? - Shit ! Kix ! - Who ? Why is this man threatening my husband with a gun ? - Do not allow ... - Shut her up . - Get down , you Nazi bitch . - No no ! Cookie , Cookie , Cookie ! No no no no ! Cookie ! Do not ! Do not ! Please do not leave me ! It 's a bad plan anyway . The best strategy is , to destroy the enemy from within . He must defeat himself . Do not be an enemy , Bishop ! The personification of the devil is a symbol of all evil . In the form of humanoids . That 's you , black blood ! Let me go , black blood ! I 'm going to kill them all ! Just wait , I 'll kill you ! Keep your breath and keep the peace with God . Shit ! What do the Noids know about God ? You are raised as rats in the laboratory . Is the color of our blood so different ? Are not we all children of God ? God did not create you . - We did . You are an abomination without a soul . - I am sorry ! I can not hear you ! Does your heart hurt ? Let me have a look . The old warriors believed , that the heart was sacred . That if a hunter tasted his flesh , I could look at the spiritual world . But I do not see any spiritual world . Maybe she was the only one , who had no soul . Food for the creatures of God . You disappoint me , Bishop . I expected much more from Mara 's husband . You are more trash than the man . Barbarous and cruel . A daughter . Our daughter , Mara . Come on , Bishop . Follow me . How can you leave us alone ? ! Are you my daughter ? My name is Aluxia . I have been waiting for you . - I 'm dead ? - Do you feel dead ? Not quite . Just tired . You 've been dreaming . Yes . And you were there . I do not want to get lost . - Leave it alone , Aluxia . - Ok dad . Why am I still alive ? I made a promise to your wife . " You killed her . " - Do not . That 's what they want to make you believe . Because you did ? Why did you take it from me ? Mara was my creator . She got me up , knew I was different . She was my mother . You do not have mothers ! The quarantine of the Federation did it for the test . So that we begin to show genetic anomalies . Anomalies that the superior command did not like . Like what . - Hair ? - Some of us . For others , like me , or more Advanced . We have developed the ability , to reproduce . Your wife kept the secret for a long time . When she threatened , with scattering the secret . The top command entered . They wanted to keep it a secret . At all costs Stop ! They have no right ... Your investigation is over . Dirty Noid-Bitch ! No , you murdered her ! I saw it with my own eyes ! I did not kill her ! I tried to save her . She died in my arms . She begged me to take the baby , but it was very late . Liar ! I understand , why do not you believe me . It 's hard to accept , that your world is breaking . When you are in it , pick up the pieces . But maybe ... You believe her . Come Aluxia , let 's play somewhere else . Bishop , I 'm sorry , my love . I wanted to tell you . I feared for your life . I knew the truth too late . I was wrong . We were all wrong . We have created them , but we do not control it . We are not their gods . Your destiny is yours . Like us , they can love ... They can create offspring . They have souls , who long for freedom . The humanoids must release them . Remember when we said , that we were going to this place ? Yes . Across the country , up here . Can you remember , what 's the name of this place ? - Selegna Sol . " All right , Selegna Sol . We can leave this cave cold . The Selegna Sol . There it is wonderfully hot . - Are you waiting for it ? - Yeah . I also . Why did you come back ? And you risked all this ? I was once a slave . I dreamed of it , like a free man walking on ice . No matter how many men tried to pull that dream out of my mind . I hid it deep in my heart . And now as a free man I walk on the ice . I found myself chained to this beautiful flower . And she deserved more , like my simple dream . This is not a place where the soul of a child can flourish . Your wife spoke of a magnificent place in the west . Where the ice must melt . And the seasons have agreed for decades . It is a myth . Anyone who has gone to look for him never came back . Would you have returned from this place if you had discovered something beautiful ? Only a small flower changes the course of humanity And the opinions of a man . Your wife promised to show me the way to this place . The next day she was dead . The promise of Selegna Sol died with her Do not . She hid the coordinates deep into my DNA . Somehow , my intuition pushed me to find out . Selegna Sol . It 's a pretty long night , on the other side of the world It will be the journey of life . Trajan will send the Spartans to hunt you down . Not if he thinks I 'm dead . This is one of the original prototypes of the Ash-300 series . Killed during the rebellion . On my own , I have added DNA synthesis through epigenetic reprogramming . Embryonic stem cells once paired with their DNA became identical to mine . You made a barbecue clone of yourself . - I 'm going to travel with you , to deliver the body . - Do not . You are a free man . - But promise me one thing . - Tell me . Aluxia must do this for Selegna Sol . Fact ! Now it 's just you and me , Mara . Just you and me . Alone on the ice . You were right about them . You were always right . It 's a murder . It always was . And I owe this crime . I give up I give up everything . Even that cascade of memory , which I chose to drown . Mara ! This final act ... This delivery . I renounce everything , that I have hoped to be Commander Bishop . It 's good to see him alive . Trajan ! Mission " Winter Dream " Accomplished Ash 's body is in the sack . - Send an extraction team . " Well done , Spartan . You will be a hero in the world ! I 'm not interested . Did you find out , where do the other bastards hide ? Oh , come on , Bishop ! We know they are breeding like rabbits for decades . Why do you put your hologram and find it yourself , Trajan ? Come on Bishop , if you do not want to cooperate we can always extract your information from your neuro-implant . If required . Is that what you told my wife ? Before he murdered her ? It was never personal , Bishop ! But humanoid reproduction is a capital offense . The scientific ambition of your wife was the death sentence . This is why the human race takes precedence for its petty grievances . I 've died 1,000 times to catch you , Trajan . And I will die a thousand times more , to see your head on a stake ! I trained you well , Bushio ... too well ! I guess you 're already dead . That would have saved me a lot of trouble . That would have cleared this difficult situation . Sorry to disappoint you , General . Check the body . He is our man , General . Ash-393 is dead , Mr. Excellent . The Federation has become a little more secure . Give us the coordinates of the humanoid settlement ! Or get ready for a lobotomy ! I do not think so , Trajan . Let 's see if your implants survive a grenade explosion . Come now , Commander you have known , how this will end . Like his wife ! You have to choose a page . With those ice cream ? There are better machines ! Without us , they have no future . They were built for and by us ! They are not our children , they are slaves . Our survival depends on extermination ! Open your eyes , Bishop ! We are surrounded by ice , this planet is dead ! There are not enough resources to pick them up these days . Would you choose those of your own kind ? If this is what we will become then yes ! I choose them . Your new rank is JMATR ! FUCK MORE THAN ALL RECOGNITION ! After your Spartan body . Alpha , Mike , Foxtrot ! Also know as ... Goodbye , motherfuckers . Kill him ! What the ... ? Something is wrong with the weapons Malfunction ! Malfunction of the weapon , sir ! Welcome to the area of death , idiots ! Come on ! Kill these weak heads ! What happens to you ? Come on ! This is not over yet ! You come to my death list ! I will hunt you personally ! This is a high treason to the Federation ! Go to hell ! That gave me luck . It was almost a palette , until I met my new friends . It 's good to see you alive , brother . Who put us in charge of the world ? How did our lie become our truth ? Nobody cares to remember . The cold heart of nature now forms honest men on the ice . And under the area of death , life comes . After 300 years of slavery , The humanoids are walking towards their freedom . We did it , Mara ! Thank you my love . I 'll see you upstairs . In a world invaded by cowards . The only thing left for a man is to fight . Fight , until hell freezes . Then fight them on the ice .

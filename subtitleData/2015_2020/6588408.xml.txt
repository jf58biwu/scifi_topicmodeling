 72 HOURS EARLIER ABANDONED COAHUILA INDUSTRIES MINERAL PROCESSING PLANT BLUE SPRINGS , KENTUCKY Intel confirms three targets . Repeat this is a capture mission . Get the Guanos and go , copy that . Time to nut up , corn flake . All clear . Maintain communication and clear your sector , return to position . Move it out . Watch yourself . I think I saw something . I 'm going down to two . No , we go together . We wait , we could lose them . I 'm going in . Regan , return to your team at checkpoint alpha . Regan , give me your position . She 's not responding . Always a team player . I 'm going down to get her . Meet me back at alpha . Page ? Page , are you there ? Regan , give me your position . Regan , give us your position . We got our dicks flapping in the wind up here . We heard shots fired . Page , what 's your position ? Briggs , we 're under attack . I 'm going after Regan . Page , say again . Page ! Regan ! Page ! No ! Page . Hunters 1x01 - The Beginning the End BALTIMORE , MARYLAND I hear something . Are you sure ? There 's someone downstairs . Maybe it 's your hearing aid acting up . I 'm sure . All right , all right , I got it . - Go check on Emme . - Okay . Hey Ab , did you leave the window open ? No , why ? We got ourselves an intruder . Hey , hey ... Come on , let 's go . Wait , what are you doing ? Putting him back where he belongs . What ? No . He 's so young and he 's all alone . Abs , he 'll be fine . You got enough on your plate . You can 't keep every stray we find . Emme ? Emme ! How could you say that in front of her ? I didn 't mean her . You need to apologize to her ... now . Of course . I 'll meet you back upstairs . Okay . We 're not keeping the cat . Emme ... I 'm sorry about what I said . I wasn 't talking about you , I promise . Come on , Emme , say something . Shut the door , please . Emme ... Okay . Good night . Preliminary exam confirms these bodies match those previously found . I need full forensics . The more we know about how our team took them out , the safer we 'll be on our next op . And Agent Page , sir ? We 'll handle his autopsy internally . I 'll notify his loved ones , cover why we need a closed casket . In case you 're in any doubt as to my opinion , the loss of Page is unacceptable . Full disclosure ... Page 's death was completely avoidable . - Was our intel bad ? - No . She was . It 's a mother lode of information . Coahuila was a calcium carbonate plant before they shut it down . Drug traffickers use that to cut heroin . It 's actually limestone , sir . No signs of any drugs , sir , but the place was creepy as shit . We found a cage full of rabbits . And whatever the hell that thing is . What we do know is this ... Coahuila cell was part of a larger terrorist network . The Hunter threat is imminent . We need to find a link to their leadership . Stop the Hunters before they strike again . After a highly successful operation , that resulted in the shutting down of the largest heroin producing ring in the state , the FBI now finds itself the subject of investigation . The " Washington Post " is reporting that an internal inquiry was launched today prompted by a number of complaints about a highly decorated key officer involved in that heroin task force . In other news , the Royals won over the Angels and now have a 1-0 lead in the three game series . FBI REGIONAL OFFICE Agent Carroll , this is an official inquiry and you are on record . How 's the counseling going ? It 's not mandatory . No medication for your PTSD ? Doing anything at all to help yourself ? Walking along the beach at sunset . What about Dauson 's daughter ? Your partner dies , you take in his kid . Emme 's got nothing to do with this . She 's got issues of her own . That 's gotta be a lot of stress . I said ... it 's got nothing to do with Emme . Sir . My favorite piece . We 'll start on it next week . Thanks , Abby . Three cell phones seized in the raid . Each received the same photo an hour before the raid . Encryption ? Yeah , top notch . RSA 4096 . I ran it through the NSA 's quantum . They just upgraded to eight kilocubics , greedy bastards . I don 't know what that means . It means I got this ... Abby Carroll , 32 . Piano teacher . FROM : FLYNN KEPT MY COOL . ALL YOU . XD This is Agent Carroll , leave a message . Babe , it 's me . Don 't forget the wine . And don 't be late . 8 : 30 . It 's okay , I 'm right here . Hello ? Who 's there ? They say that music is the strangest form of magic . You know who said that ? Marilyn Manson . I saw him at the Bowery in New York last summer . Say what you will about the guy 's music , he 's one hell of a showman . Wanna hear my magic , Abby ? Please , don 't hurt me . On the contrary , I am here to help you . What about these ? What about these sonic crutches ? We don 't need ' em , do we , Abby ? We 'll just ... - turn it up . - No ! No ! Please , no . Hey , babe , sorry I 'm late . Traffic was crazy . I got the wine ... Hey , where 's Abby ? She 's not here . - What ? - She 's not upstairs . That 's weird . Her car 's in the driveway . We got that potluck . I need to report a missing person . Yeah , it 's been 48 hours . I appreciate that . I 'm sure she will too . Thanks . I ... saved you some anchovy . Are you okay ? Yeah , not even close . We 're gonna find her . I need to practice . Abby gave me a new piece of music . I want it to be good when she comes home . Externally , the subject presents as a human male , approximately 30 years of age . But as with previous Hunter specimens , the similarity to humans ends here . As observed in previous subjects , there is an outer layer of human integumentary and vascular system , including blood and skin . The ribcage is cross-braced , with two resident chambers below the ribs in place of lungs . The heart is held in place by tendons thicker than those found in humans , possibly the result of evolution in a stronger gravitational environment . My God . This subject sustained severe injury from a gunshot to the face . - But it didn 't kill him ? - No . A sonic blast to the cranial region was the cause of death . We 're lucky we only lost one man . Move your feet , come on , move your feet ! Keep your hands high . Higher , that 's good . That 's it , that 's it . Flynn ? I 'm home . Abby ? Where 've you been ? I 've been worried sick . Hey . Emme ! Emme ? There you are . You scared the hell out of me . So you do care . I thought you only wanted me for my Ritalin . A policeman came to the house today . And he asked me a lot of questions about you and Abby . Like what ? Like , if you guys fight a lot . If you 've ever hurt her , things like that . It was like he thought you did something to Abby . What do you think ? I think he was an asshole . It 's true . You would never hurt Abby . I mean , if you wanted someone gone , it would be me . I need to ask you something . And you need to tell me the truth . Is there anything that she was doing that I didn 't know about ? Anything ? Last Friday , Abby was late when she picked up me at school . She said she went to a music store in Dundalk , but when we got in the car I saw this . That 's , like , in the total opposite direction . Arrive at 1445 Quaker Ridge Road in 45 minutes . ETU HEADQUARTERS N.W. WASHINGTON D.C. Abby Carroll . Reported missing less than 24 hours after her picture was sent to the Coahuila cell . Could be a sleeper agent . Or an innocent civilian . Whoever she is , she 's also married to an FBI agent . Flynn Carroll . Did two tours of Afghanistan before joining the Bureau . Spent some time with JTTF , mostly narcotics . Undercover of late . He 's being investigated internally for questionable behavior . A Fed . He 's gonna be sticking his nose in our business . Well , we won 't let that happen , will we ? We have a lead on the Carroll surveillance . Could be another cell . But when we got in the car , I saw this . Arrive at 1445 Quaker Ridge Road in 45 minutes . All right , pull the thread , see where it leads . Eyes only , 1445 Quaker Ridge Road . Yeah ? Mr. Carroll ? This is Principal Sherman . I 'm afraid Emme has had another ... incident . How bad is it ? She 'll be fine , but ... coupled with her spectrum disorder , I 'm afraid self-harming is not something that we 're equipped for here . We need to look at another option . I 'll be there as soon as I can . Pretty boy 's going in . Jackson said eyes only . FBI . Turn around ! Put your hands where I can see ' em ! Turn around ! Be quiet . As quiet as a church mouse . Abby ... where is she ? She 's gone , and you 'll never see her again . You took my wife , asshole . My , my , my , such strong language . I 've got him . Get in the car ! Go ! Who are you ? Agent Briggs . We 're on the same side . I 'm looking for your wife . Bullshit ! Don 't believe me ? Ask my boss . He 's very keen to meet you . Agent Carroll . I 'll be handling your debriefing . Okay . Who the fuck are you people ? Agents Regan and Briggs work for me . My name 's Truss Jackson . I 'm Commander of Joint Task Force Wotan . Though , we prefer to call ourselves the Exo-Terrorism Unit ... E.T.U. I worked in counterterrorism . I never heard of any ... Exo-Terrorism Unit . The E.T.U. deals with the kinds of terrorists other agencies aren 't equipped to handle . Like the ones we believe are responsible for the disappearance of your wife . You think terrorists kidnapped my wife ? She 's a piano teacher . How did you find that farmhouse ? By reading a fortune cookie . Did you see the men inside ? Could you identify the suspects inside the farmhouse ? I couldn 't make ' em in a lineup , but I got a glimpse . One guy had dreads . The other two looked like burn victims . Who are they ? - It 's classified . - Yeah . Tell me what they have to do with my wife . I 'm not at liberty to say . Hey . Do those bastards have my wife ? Go home . Get some rest . We 'll talk some more later . So ? Emme , I 'm sorry I couldn 't pick you up . Principal Sherman brought me home . She 's not as much of a bitch as I thought she was . What happened ? A girl asked why I wasn 't crying about Abby . And I don 't know . So I hurt myself . There 's a therapeutic boarding school ... - Boarding school ? - Therapeutic boarding school . Abby and I were looking into it after your last incident . Emme , I 'm sorry . Now that Abby 's gone , you 're getting rid of me just like you always wanted . That isn 't true . You promised my dad . He was your partner . - You promised him . You 're a liar . - I know . - Liar ! Liar ! - No . Liar ! Liar ! Liar ! Emme , no , no , no , no , no . Hey , hey . Hey . Hey . I don 't want to stay with you anyway . Emme . Let go of me ! Emme . You want some help ? No . Hey , Emme . Emme . Carroll is a skilled agent and a nosy one at that . More importantly , his wife seems to mean something to the Hunters . And then there 's the business of the scar . I understand . He is a risk . All right . I 'll handle it . Agent Carroll . You find my wife ? Then what is it ? Your transfer to Homeland Security . Homeland Security ? It 's a cover . Welcome to the E.T.U. ETU HEADQUARTERS All personnel are cleared for classified operations . Briggs here comes courtesy of Australian Special Ops Command . With your skills and experience , you 'll be an excellent replacement for an agent we just lost . That 's not a great sales pitch . What I 'm about to show you is known only to this unit and a handful of people at the top of the D.O.D. This information remains classified , period . Are we clear ? Yeah . Yes , sir . The terrorists we 're chasing aren 't human . We used to say the same thing about the Hajis . Not like that . This Hunter and two others were part of a cell hiding out in an abandoned calcium carbonate refinery in Kentucky . They were part of a larger , international organization . The U.S. government first became aware of their existence in 2009 . This some kind of hoax ? Does this look like a hoax to you ? Hunter Number Seven , AKA Lionel McCarthy . He 's a professional DJ who uses the name Cymatic Society . Have we reached out to T.S.C. ? McCarthy 's on their watch list . He may attempt to travel to the Middle East , where as far as we know , Brother Number Four is based . That 's their leader . He 's like the bin Laden of little green men . If McCarthy 's on the no-fly list , he won 't get past security . Or an X-ray machine . He wont have to get past all of them , just one . Randall Slavich runs security at an airport near D.C. We suspect he 's a sleeper agent . We 've been monitoring his communications for weeks , and our surveillance turned up nothing until last night , when Slavich received this link from McCarthy via McCarthy 's Spotify chat . That song was playing in the farmhouse . O.M.D. , Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark . '80s British New Wave group . They did that song , " If You Leave . " It was in ... " Pretty in Pink " - in the last scene , when Andie ... - Jules . My guess is that it 's an encoded message . I think McCarthy 's telling Slavich that he needs help getting out of the country . Slavich 's next shift starts in four hours . We 're gonna take a team , stake it out , see if McCarthy shows . Abby Carroll may turn up with McCarthy . And if she does ? She 's to be apprehended and held for interrogation . That is all . Let 's go , people . Let 's bring ' em in this time . Hunters use sonic weapons . The two-eighty . - That 's two-eighty as in ... - Decibels . Well , look at you with the science . E.T.U. weapons are reverse engineered using Hunter guns that we 've seized . Battery snaps out , in , like so . Aim for the head . That 's how you take one down . There 'll be a muffled sound , some kickback . You 'll get used to the feel . Like spooning a lover . A gun that shoots Martians . We don 't know where they come from . Could be space . No one knows for sure . What we do know is that Hunters don 't come in peace . Stay calm , keep focused and whatever you do , stay the hell away from this one . MARYLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT She had a secret . Your wife . Something you didn 't know . Something that got her caught . You don 't know anything about Abby . Everyone 's hiding something . Sir , you need to hear this . On the surface , just another lame remix , but when we pull the tracks apart , that 's when things get interesting . Those clicks were on the tape from the Coahuila factory . Yeah , we 'll see . We 'll start cracking it . That 's not all , sir . There was another track buried in the song . No code , no attempt to hide it . - What is it ? - It 's a warning , sir . This is a warning from our leader , dear Brother Number Four . This is his one and only warning , so sit up and listen close . For years we have remained hidden amongst you , watching , waiting . We take nothing without reason . What we want is good and right . It 's what we 've been waiting for . Their first direct communication , and it 's a damn manifesto . Our cause is just . The end justifies our means . Love swings the hammer . Blood will be shed . You will bleed , you will cry , and you will die . You will not be safe . You will pay the price . We are many , we are everywhere , and we are angry . The end begins now . Escalator . McCarthy 's here , headed to security . Alone ? - Looks like . - Stay with him . We 're on him . We 're at baggage carousel one . Slavich 's letting McCarthy through a secure door . We 're in pursuit . Briggs , Slavich 's been hit . He 's heading to the service hangar . I 'm on my way . Slavich ! Slavich , stop ! Tell me where my wife is . Tell me ! Tell me where my wife is , or I 'll blow your damn head off . Hello , Allison . You can 't stop us . We 're inside . Inside what ? The E.T.U. We 're inside . They 're using you . Carroll ? Where 's Regan ? Where 's McCarthy ? What a fine and fearsome creature you are . Magnificent in every way . You don 't know me . Oh , but I do . I know what 's inside of both of us , and I know how badly it wants to come out . Go on . Shoot me . Spill my blood , then lick it up , and then run with me like the animal you are . He 's got a gun ! No ! Holy shit . He escaped . He got a shot off first .

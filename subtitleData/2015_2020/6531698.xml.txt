 [ Pounding ] [ Knocking ] [ yawns ] Morning , honey . Hardly . Must be nice getting to sleep in . You know , some of us have to work around here . What ? I work around here ! Who do you think supervises this ? ! All day long , it 's " Seòor Monarch , where do I put this ? Seã 'or Monarch , eggshell or semi-gloss ? " This is work ! Uh , I wasn 't doing you , Manolo . I 'm talking about your real work . You haven 't arched in weeks . - Yeah , ' cause you won 't let me ! - It 's not me ! Venture 's a level 10 protagonist now . - You are only at a level 4 . - And you promised to bump me up ! How am I supposed to do that when all you do Is lie around in your robe all day And party all night long with your Henchman ? Well , at least he 's loyal . [ Groans ] You got to meet me halfway here . Hire more henchmen , build a new cocoon , and go arch someone else for just a little while ! That worked out great last time . Then rob a bank , ransom an heiress or something . Show the council ... no , show me you 're better than a 4 . Hey , when you married me , it was for better or worse , not better than 4 . I married the Monarch . I don 't even know who this person is . - D-Do you need a hug ? - To the Morpho cave ! [ Ominous music plays ] 6x05 - Tanks for Nuthin' Mm . [ Sniffs ] Huh ? Ohh ! The [ bleep ] ? [ Mid-tempo music plays ] - Hey , there 's coffee . - Ah . Thanks . Hey , I wasn 't trying to sneak out or anything . Uh , you looked busy , and I , uh , didn 't want to scuff your nice floor . - Okay , look , about last night ... - What ? Oh , you 're still here ? Let 's make that coffee to go , huh , Heracles ? [ Gears grinding ] Hank : [ sniffs ] Whoa ! He smells awful ! And this is coming from someone who 's smelled a lot of dead archenemies . Ohh ! Whew ! You know , I 've had dreams about you in an outfit like this , fraulein . [ Groans ] Knock it off , Venture ! You 're in a lot of trouble . This wasn 't just some anonymous henchman that you could bury in your flower bed . Haranguetan was a top-level nemesis . Well , what ? I had nothing to do with this . - Ask Billy . He saw the whole thing . - Oh , please . This had " death by Samson " written all over it . - Oh , speak of the devil . Samson . - Huh ? [ Dramatic note plays ] Oh , shit ! - [ Sighs ] Damn it . - At ease . We 're just here for the body . Your handiwork I take it . Huh ? No . I , uh , smacked him up a bit , sure , but his head was still screwed on straight when I left . Well , then you won 't mind if I take a look at your surveillance tapes to confirm that . You touch our tapes , and they 'll be pulling you out of that hole next . [ Inhales deeply ] Bag him up and move him out , people . We 're done here . [ Both grunt ] What ? You too ? Ick ! Like father , like son . I 'm not interested , Junior . But those were for Uncle Hatred . Henchman : If we could just get your Dr. Hancock on these , we 'll be out of your hair . Oh , no , please , keep it ... courtesy of the new Guild of calamitous intent . And should you ever have any issues with our service , please feel free to call our helpful hate-line . [ Chuckles ] Brock , why are you walking like that ? Is it a side effect of the God gas ? Are you experiencing anal leakage ? - I don 't need another olestra on my hands . - No , Doc , I ... maybe , actually . Chairman ! Oh , there you are . The good ship Ven-Tech 's hit a bit of a P.R. iceberg . Ye got to see this . [ Moans ] Whoa ! Is this real life ? Man : Y-You 're okay , pally . It 's just from the God gas . [ Screaming ] I feel funny . Why is this happening to me ? [ Laughter ] This one can 't hold his God gas ! - Look at him . - [ Scottish accent ] Oh , horrible . [ Laughter ] Ow ! Oh , my head . - Oh , man ! - What 's so funny ? What are you looking at ? Oh , my God ! Is that from last night ? Take that down ! Take it down immediately ! No way ! We got like 80,000 hits already . [ Doorbell rings ] Wrong ... 80,001 ! - Ow ! - Well , I think you look just adorable . [ Ringing continues ] Hey ... Hey , Billy , are you hungry ? [ Laughter ] Mom ! They 're picking on me ! William , there 's a Nazi here to see you . [ Ominous music plays ] [ Whirring ] [ Telephone ringing ] [ Whirring stops ] Uh , m-mayor 's office ? - What the " f " ? - Hey , what 's this one do ? Uh , Blue Morpho backscratcher ? - Mm . Oh , sweet . - All right , check it out . I spent all morning putting together a handy chart for everyone currently in line to Arch Venture . So , Wide Wale 's Venture 's primary , right ? But he 's ceded sub-arching rights to these other level 10 's through the Guild 's " fiends family plan . " - Now , they , in turn , each have to ... - Blah-blah-blah ! Why aren 't you using the big computer ? Because this Nixon-era fossil 's got less memory than a Speak spell ! And there 's no internet because there was no internet . Hmm , might need to upgrade , then ... get some new Morpho , eh ? - How long do you plan on doing this ? - Till every one of them is dead . Aw , dude , come on . There 's got to be another way . I am not a murderer . - You were last night . - All right , that was an accident . Dead men can 't arch ... or rat on us . - Hey , should we kill Manolo ? - What ? Dude ! Wh-Why ? 'Cause he 's seen the secret cave . I 'm pretty sure he 's padding his invoices . He does quality work ! - You 're paying for the quality ! - All right , all right , fine ! We can 't do anything until we get the Morpho-mobile out of the impound , anyway . [ Clears throat ] So , Kano , my ample accomplice , to the Morpho-scooters ! [ Dramatic note plays ] Oh , yeah , that 's brilliant . Then we have to go back for those tomorrow . They 're not gonna fit in the trunk , you know ? All right , to the Morpho-copter ! [ Dramatic note plays ] Nope , don 't have one . Eh , damn it ! What do we got for this ? Metrocards . Dr. Mrs. The Monarch : The Quizboy claims Venture and Brock were present when Haranguetan was murdered , but he was really foggy on the details . Not surprising , considering the boy was hippy-flipping on Doc Venture 's good time goof gas . He said the killer was a " handsome masked avenger , resplendent in blue . " The Blue something ... Blue " Morpho . " Name ring a bell ? Only funeral bells . The Blue Morpho 's been dead for decades . There can only be one explanation ! - Ghost Ninja ! - Time tunnel ! There is a new Blue Morpho . That , or the lad could 've been hallucinating ' . - Yeah , or just straight up lying ' ! - Well , yes , those could also work . Well , if I could just get a hold of Venture 's surveillance tapes , we 'd know for sure , but he won 't budge . Think I might can help you out there , councilwoman . What ? You 're gonna change his mind ? Let 's just say I left a few bugs in his place last time I paid a visit . [ chuckles ] The Ventures can 't hide nothin ' from old Wide Wale . All right , e-mail me if you find anything , councilman . In the meantime , I have to break the news to the widow Haranguetan . Why didn 't anyone tell me we could just hologram in ? [ Siren wailing in distance ] [ Sighs ] - Sigh . - Yeah , these are never easy . The bereaved can often become volatile ... lots of " blame the messenger . " Ohh , remember man grenade 's widow ? Yes , oh , I still can 't go through metal detectors . Maybe you two should wait in the car . [ Soft music playing ] Ugh . [ Scottish accent ] We 're all paid up . - Pardon ? - Our dues ... we 're paid up . You 're from the Guild , ain 't ya ? Y-Yes , but I 'm ... I 'm not here about your dues , Mrs. Haranguetan . Battleaxe . - S-Sorry . - It 's me name . Take enough shit from that no-account husband ... I 'll not take his name , as well . Oh , uh , okay , um , about your husband ... Whatever he 's done , I don 't know nothin ' ' bout it . Ain 't seen hide nor hair of the worthless bastard since Tuesday last . [ Inhales deeply ] Mrs. Haranguetan ... B-Battleaxe , your husband is dead . [ Crying ] Oh , no , oh , no ! Not me Ronnie ! Ooh , not me sweetheart ! - Say it ain 't so . - A drink on the house ! To Haranguetan ! All : [ slurring ] Haranguetan ! [ Bleep ] off , the lot of yous . The , um , council would like - to express its sincerest ... apologies . - Who done him in ? We don 't know yet , but I assure you the council is d ... I have no use for your bloody assurances , so kindly leave us the keys to the Haranguetank and be on your way . - His what ? - Haranguetank ! His battle van , what 'd ya think ? Never arches without it . There wasn 't any ... we didn 't even find ... Well , you 'd better bloody well find it , then . What do I pay me bloody dues for ? [ Sobbing ] It 's all I 've left of him . Sure , his breath was crap , and he beat me when he was in his cups , but I loved him ! And he loved that Haranguetank . [ Sighs ] I 'll ... I 'll see what I can do . " All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity . " Who said that ? Anyone ? Think , my children . No need to answer at once . [ Chuckles ] No matter . Philosophy is not about the rote memorization and regurgitation of facts . It is about ... [ device beeps ] [ Chuckles evilly ] Well , that will be all for today , my eager , young small brains . Please leave your papers on my desk as you wander off to your unexamined lives of gravity bongs , ceaseless tweets , and date rapery . Mr. Venture , a moment , please . [ Clears throat ] Um , yes , sir ? Professor Nidaba ? I 've read your paper . - Wh-When ? I just put it on the ... - Just now . In addition to the multiple doctorates I hold from Stanford , Cambridge , the Sorbonne , et Alia , I am in possession of a certificate of completion from the Evelyn Wood program . The point is your paper is truly terrible . - Oh , uh , but ... - Mr. Venture , you are one of my brightest pupils this semester , but you seem ... distracted . - Is there trouble at home ? - Well , a-a guy broke in with a metal whale monster the other day , and then some " yelly " guy broke in last night . But , well , he died . As I suspected , the soot on your right shoe ... industrial concrete of a grade used in skyscrapers with trace amounts of carrara marble ... indisputable evidence of a whale-sized hole in your lobby . - Wow , good eye . - Furthermore , your clothing bears a faint odor of antiseptic . You visited a hospital this morning . A thin residue of pollen on your left cuff - tells me you brought flowers . - Whoa , that 's amazing ! I merely interpret the data , and the data tells me that your chaotic home life is a distraction from your studies . I suggest you avoid your domicile altogether this evening , say , between the hours of 9 : 00 and 10 : 30 P.M. ... that you might better focus , eh , for tomorrow 's exam . O-Oh , w-well , okay , Dr. Nidaba . Thank you . I 'll sure take all your advice . Mm , excellent . [ Laughs evilly ] " All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks . " [ Chuckles ] Nietzsche . It was Friedrich Nietzsche . How did they not know that ? Dr. Mrs. The Monarch : Well , the good news is I 've located your , um , Haranguetank . [ Keyboard clacking ] You 've had about 50 unpaid tickets on the thing , so the NYPD towed it . - So that 's it , then ? - Yeah , that 's it . You just go down to the impound , pay the fine , drive it home . [ Sobbing ] Once again , the Guild wishes to express its most sincere c ... - Are ... Are you okay ? - I just don 't know if I should be driving in me state of emotions . Oh , uh ... do you need me to go with you ? Ooh , would you ? Oh , you 're a star . Let me just go put me face on . [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] [ bar door swings open ] [ Computer beeps ] [ Slurps ] [ Ominous music plays ] _ Mm . [ Beeps ] [ Toilet flushes ] All right , poshna , I 'm ready . Let 's go get us a Haranguetank ! - Can I help you ? - Yes , you have my car . License and registration . But of course . Here 's my license ! - Oh ! - And here 's my registration ! [ Laughs evilly ] [ Buzzer ] Oh . Attack ! Pirate Captain : Nah , nah , nah , Ms. Warrington . Uh , this whole God gas business has been blown way out of proportion . But , Pirate Captain , the video is clear proof that Venture Techno-industries is engaging in illegal and unethical mind-control experiments on human subjects . No , no , no , t 'was a private joke video made by a couple of extremely low-level employees in one of our wee subdivisions . For the record , Ven-Tech is not working on no God gas . Dr. Venture : Well , I hope you enjoyed your $ 200 million cheeseburger , because our stock dropped 50 points today ! My fault ? How is it my fault ? What ? Who 's that ? White ? Tell him no , we are not taking God gas to the Science Now conference . [ Powering up ] Billy , I 'll call ya back . - Pirate Captain , the ... - What ? Let me finish ! [ Explosion ] Now , no , I 've been taken out of context . [ Alarm blaring ] But Pirate Captain ... Well , you have to give me a chance to ... [ Sighs ] Where the hell is it ? - He said it 'd be here . - I don 't know . Hang on ! I 'm gonna check the next aisle . - I think I see something blue . - Hurry up ! The poison in those darts is from the ' 70s . If it didn 't kill him , the guard might wake up any minute feeling groovy ! [ Groans ] Ah ! What the ... Oh , oh , lady ! [ War cries ] What is wrong with you ? ! All you had to do is pay the ticket ! I hate [ bleep ] coppers . [ Gagging , coughing ] Greetings , Dr. Venture . I am Think Tank , - and I will be your nemesis this evening . - Uh ... Brock ? I know , Doc , I 'm on it . Just get to the panic room , stat . - Uh , not really an option . - Sit , Dr. Venture . Please . I do apologize for the rather theatrical entrance , but I find a bold opening always makes for a more spirited game . And I intend to enjoy ours to the fullest . The Guild has of late seen fit to mismatch me against a procession of muscle-bound subhumans and caped half-wits , but in you , my good doctor , I finally have an adversary worthy of my prodigious intellect . - So , shall we match wits ? - What ? Oh . - [ Chuckles ] I don 't really play . - Oh , you ... you don 't ? More of a parcheesi man . Got one of those in your little glove box ? Oh . Oh , dear . I can 't say this isn 't a disappointment . I had this whole thing planned . Look , could we move this along ? I 've already been arched twice this week , and , frankly , it 's getting old . - What do you want ? - Ah . What does any man want , Dr. Venture ? Nietzsche once wrote , - " The true man wants dan ... " - Oh , Jesus , all right ! That 's it . [ Dialing ] Who ... Who are you calling ? Guild of calamitous intent . Uh , yes , hi . This is Dr. Thaddeus S. Venture . I 'd like to register a complaint . Ah , you want customer service . Please hold while I connect you . Customer service . Debbie speaking . Wha ... oh , hi , Debbie ? This is Dr. Thaddeus S. Venture . [ Elevator bell dings ] - I have an issue with a new arch you sent me . - Ah , here comes your knight . So it 's to be the king 's indian defense , is it ? And you said you didn 't play . Hmm ? [ War cries ] Hmm . [ Grunting ] This is getting ridiculous . How am I supposed to get any work done around here when these clowns keeps showing up ? And this new one , he 's a talker . Well , we 're very sorry to hear you 're dissatisfied with your service , Dr. Venture . Would you mind holding while I pull up the details of your account ? Uh ... [ electronic lounge music plays ] [ Sighs ] [ Clinking ] - Oh . Oh , god . - Oh ! No , still smells of him . [ Chuckles ] Whiskey , cheap Chinese cigarettes , and the sweat of a man who may or may not have been part ape . This is the Haranguetank ? Aye , home sweet home . Can I get you something ? Whiskey ? No , I think we should just go . - Wait , you live in this thing ? - Aah ! Ow ! [ Rustling ] What was that ? [ Gasps ] Parkies on patrol ! - [ Groans ] Owie . - Psst ! Quit screwing around ! Found it . [ Glug ! Glug ! Glug ! ] Dr. Mrs. The Monarch : You ? ! [ Suspenseful music plays ] [ Whimpers ] Wait here . Ha ! Too slow that time , stink tank . Looks like we got ourselves a good old-fashioned stalemate . No , we do not . Your position is untenable , Mr. Samson . I need only to increase my force field 's power to sever your brachial artery . Yeah ? Then you 'd be drowning in my blood . Ha ! Now who 's untenable ? I have a high-velocity cannon pointed at your chest . I could dodge it . [ Electronic lounge music plays ] Come on , come on . Henchman : Sorry to keep you waiting . Oh , thank God . Look , I 've been ... Did you now you can now pay your Guild dues online ? - Damn it to hell ! - Simply log in ... - Oh . - So , what ? - You 're stalking me now ? - Wha ... What ? No . - Dude , I 'm just ... - Relax . I 'm just messing with you . Hey , so , [ sighs ] sorry if I was weird this morning . It 's cool . I think this makes us even . I 'm just not one for pillow talk , you know ? I-I 've got a lot going on right now , what , with my career , my alter ego , my alter ego 's career ... Yeah , I kind of got a lot going on myself right now . - That Think Tank guy just ... - Whoa , whoa , Think Tank ? Oh , do not even tell me that pompous son of a gorgon is messing with my man . I know who you are , Blue Morpho ! Come on out , coward ! Show yourself ! [ Car door closes ] Battleaxe : Ohh , flaming ' Nora , what 's keepin ' the woman ? [ Gulps ] Well , posh pattie won 't mind if we just check our e-mails . What 's this , then ? [ Gasps ] [ Crying ] Oh , there you are , me big strapping ' husband . [ Normal voice ] Ooh , look at how handsome you are in your leathers . Dr. Mrs. The Monarch : I am going to [ bleep ] kill you . Do you hear me ? - What is your wife doing here ? - Hello ? - I do not know . - I know you 're in there . If you 're trying to hide , you shouldn 't have picked a place with your big [ bleep ] face on it . - She kind of has a point . - Shut up and get us out of here . [ Engine starts ] Nice try , but you 're not gonna get very far with that boot on your car . Now come out of there with your hands up . Battleaxe : Ooh ! [ Gasps ] Oh , I can 't watch ! [ Crying ] Do you hear me ? I 'm not [ bleep ] with you ! You have three seconds . Hold on a tick . One ... [ Both whimpering ] Battleaxe : Oh , you ... - ... two ... - Ooh , you 're a sly one . ... three . [ Bullet ricochets ] - Aah ! - Oh ! Oh ! Oh , my God , oh , my God ! What 's happening ? - What ? Oh , oh ! Hey ! - Aah ! [ Engine starts ] Battleaxe : Venture ! [ Tires screech ] Henchman : Okay , Dr. Venture , now I 'm going to give you your case number . You will need to keep it handy in case we get disconnected . Do you have a pen ? Uh , yeah , hang on . - G-O-F-6-2-2 . - Hang ... Hang on . Oh , come on . - [ Chuckles ] Sucker . - Follow that Blue ... Morpho mobile . [ Engine starts , tires squeal ] Uh , hello ? [ Groans ] All right , think guy . If you 're such a super genius , can you think of a way to get cheap pen out of expensive speedsuit ? [ Metal clangs ] Ah , didn 't see that move coming , did you ? We call that an " in your face checkmate . " Well , I call it an " unsanctioned team-up . " [ Grunts ] The Guild will hear of this . Yeah , good luck with that . [ Grunts ] What do you say we take this unsanctioned team-up back to my place and make it official ? All right , but , uh ... no butt stuff this time , okay ? - I liked it ! - May I go ? - Henchman : Oh , my God , that was so [ bleep ] close ! - Monarch : Ah ! Yes ! God ! Amazing ! [ Laughs ] I love you , daddy ! Mwah ! Hey , we should totally swing over the Venture building ! What ? No ! We 're not gonna swing anywhere ! - We 're gonna bring this thing home ! - Come on ! Just a quick fly-by ! I want to take a dump in his pool . Be like old times . That skeevy little bastard ! Stay on him . It 's a straightaway . He 's turning ! Oh , my God . It looks like he 's headed for ... [ Monarch laughs crazily ] [ Ominous music plays ] Battleaxe : Ohh , don 't you worry , Ronnie . Your old Battleaxe will avenge ya , darlin ' . Prepare for battle , Venture , 'cause here comes the axe ! Whoa , what 's that up in the road ... a head ? - Taxi ? - Dr. Nidaba ? What 's he doing at our house ? Waiting for all the king 's horses and all the king 's men ? [ Horn blaring ] Whoa ! [ All screaming ] Dr. Mrs. The Monarch : Watch where you 're going ! - Watch ! - Ahh , what the hell is that ? ! Curse o ' the Blue Jesus ! [ All screaming ] [ Screams ] Whoa ! Huh ? [ Groans ] [ Screaming ] Oh , for ... now what ? [ Metal clangs ] [ Film noir music plays ] [ Theme music plays ] [ Sighs ] [ Soft music plays ] [ Footsteps on stairs ] Someone had a very busy day . Ah , the vestibule looks great , honey . Yeah , it 's , uh , starting to look like a real home now , huh , honey ? Aw , I 'm s ... I 'm sorry about this morning . I guess it 's the stress of the job and the home and all this ... - Oh , no , it 's ... - You are not the enemy , sweetie . [ Smooches ] [ Sighs ] I know who my enemy is . Battleaxe : Chirp , you slut .

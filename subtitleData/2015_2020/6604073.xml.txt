 ( NARRATOR READING ) ( ENGINE SPUTTERING ) ACKBAR : Come on , you hunk of junk . Hang in there ! ( ENGINE SPUTTERING CONTINUES ) C-3PO : Oh dear , oh dear . Do hurry , Admiral . According to my tracking computer , the stolen ship was abandoned somewhere in this vicinity . It 's not a ship . It 's my baby . And I don 't need some fancy computer to tell me that it 's right ... Here ! I 'm awesome at sensing traps . Everything else , not so much . Oh , the awful things that happened here on Coruscant . Battles , betrayals , the end of the Jedi order . Thank the maker it is over and we can get on with our lives in ... - ( RUMBLING ) - om Battle droids ! ( YELPS ) Hide me , Emperor Head ! ( SCREAMS ) Oh , take it easy , chief . The battle droids factory on Geonosis was destroyed years ago . These old junkers were reprogrammed to be useful . Perhaps they encountered R2 . Pardon me , garbage droids , uh , can you help me ? Roger , roger . Have you , by any chance , seen this chap ? - Negative , negative . - You 're not useful at all ! ALL : Sorry , sorry . ( SIGHS ) I 'll never find R2 . ( GROANS ) My sweet ride is gone . And seeing those scary things only makes me miss him more . It was he who destroyed the battle droid factory . I 'll never forget when I first saw Daisy Mae at the dealer . It all began when the Clone Wars had been raging for some time . - It 's a tale rife with excitement ... - I saved up for years . - ... and adventure and peril . And ... - Then , I studied air brushing ... A ship is just a machine ! A droid is a person . - Okay , fine . You tell your story . - Thank you . The Separatist leader , General Grievous , had somehow acquired the Republic 's top secret battle plans . This disk is all you need to crush the Jedi and win the war . Take it to the Separatist council at once . Yes , my lord . ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) Victory is ours ! Oh ! My ship ! Which was also my house ! Oopsie . After him ! Must steal new ship ! ( COUGHS ) It 's days like this that I wish I had more than half my original lungs . ( COUGHING ) Welcome aboard , Senator . The galley is well-stocked for your flight to ... Wait ! You 're not Senator Organa . What was your first clue ? C-3PO : Your hideous appearance , since you ask . GRIEVOUS : I was being sarcastic ! Great is your valour , Commander Skywalker . But still , too impulsive are you . Patience you must learn . If to be a great Jedi you one day will ... - ( LAUGHS ) - ( SCREAMS ) If you 'll excuse me . ( BEEPING EXCITEDLY ) They seem to have gone out the window . Oh , noticed that , did you , hmm ? ( GRUNTS ) I 've got you where I want you , Grievous ! Ooh , I 'm shaking in my boots . ( BEEPING ) Well , fancy meeting you here . If you two don 't mind , less yakking , more attacking ! ( GRUNTS ) - Permission to come aboard ? - Not granted . ( SCREAMING ) ( HORNS HONKING ) ( SCREAMS ) Whoa ! We 've got to help Anakin . After them ! - ( OBl-WAN WHISTLES ) - ALL : Sorry , our bad . ( BEEPING ) You , take the wheel . Me ? I 'm a terrible pilot . But I am a fast learner . ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) Uh-oh . Ah ! - That hurts . - That 's the general idea , General . ( CHUCKLES ) Get it ? Getting it and thinking it funny are two different things . ( GRUNTS ) - Uh-oh . - Uh-oh ! Uh-oh . Like I said , I am a terrible pilot ! ( METAL SCRAPING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) See ya . Would not want to be ya ! ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTS ) Oh ! - Thank you , Master . - You 're nearly a Jedi now . You can stop calling me " Master " . Sorry , Obi . Uh , let 's go back to Master . ( SIGHS ) We 'll never find Grievous . Those stolen battle plans are gone forever . Not all is lost , my friend . We still have a man on the job . Wonderful . From one horrid place to another . Come along , I have a job for you . I can only imagine what degrading task you want me to perform . Cocktail Weenies ? Oh , yes , thank you . C-3PO : This isn 't so bad . Cheese puffs ? ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Oh , spoke too soon . ( UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( METAL CLANGING ) ( BEEPING ) Pardon me , but haven 't we met before ? Probably caught him on a bad day . Good work , General . These plans will assure our ultimate victory . Yes , the winning by us is guaranteed . - I just said that . - I wanted to say it , too . Anakin , your effort to stop Grievous was brave but also reckless . Diving out of a window ? You could have been killed . - Yes , but ... - No . No " buts " . Think before you act you must . If wish to be a great Jedi you do . Hello , enemies of the Republic . This is coming from R2-D2 . He 's on Geonosis . Today , we win this war . Get those plans back you must . Go now ! - But you just said I have to think ... - No time to think . What I said forget . Go ! ( SIGHS ) You 're the boss . Oh , heck what the . For me wait ! YODA : To Geonosis ! What I 'm about to show you will change the course of history . ( BEEPING ) Behold , the Republic 's secret battle plans . ( CHEERING ) Not them . I hate the Ewoks . ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) General , what is the meaning of this ? It means , Dooku , that up the jig is . Party 's over , boys ! Oh , I don 't think so . Super Sith team , attack ! ( SCREAMS ) Mini burgers ? Tater skins ? Whoa ! Mmm . ( BEEPS ) The droid has the plans ! ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) - Give them to me . - ( BEEPING ) Give him the plans , R2 . - ( BEEPING NERVOUSLY ) - Oh , dear ! ( BEEPING ) " No ! " No ! Why are you saying " no " ? - He 's got the battle plans in him . - Oh , right . Of course . " No ! " No ! He 's setting off a chain reaction . Oh , yes , he excels at that . The whole place is going to blow ! - ( CHEERING ) - R2-D2 , you are a hero ! - ( METAL CLANGS ) - Never do that again . I was so cross with him that day . I still am . I do hope to see him again , so I can give him another swat on the dome . - ( METAL CLANGS ) - Hmm . That is an odd sound for a sheet of paper to make . This is the ship R2 was taken in . Daisy Mae ! What have they done to you , kiddo ? The Spaceport . Of course ! The villain knew we 'd follow him , so he ditched your ship for a shuttle ride elsewhere . But where , Admiral ? Where ? Leave me out of this . We 're re-bonding . - Sorry , thanks . - Hey ! Have you seen my friend ? Mister , I 'm only programmed to sell tickets . - Whoa ! - You 've got to help me . He 's a fellow droid . A hero of the Rebellion . He has been captured by a mysterious stranger . Okay , okay . Don 't get your gears in a twist . If your friend came through here he 'd be on the security video . There he is . Oh , no , that 's a fire hydrant . ( YELLS AND STAMMERS ) - A mailbox . - ( CLEARS THROAT ) So sorry for my apparent rudeness . I am in a dreadful state . Such a terrible thing to happen to a droid . And your friend 's a hero . What an awful way to treat someone who helped defeat the Empire . Yes . And the irony is , that it was the kidnapping that led to the rise of the Empire , the fall of the Jedi , and the revenge of the Sith in the first place . - Would you like to tell us about it ? - C-3PO : I certainly would . A year had passed and General Grievous and the Separatists were desperate to make a bold move that would end the war . They decided to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine . Thanks for coming by . You 're just the witness , I mean droid , I needed . I am honoured to be in the service of such a noble , upstanding public servant . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hang on a sec . Now ! Just be a moment . - ( METAL CLANGS ) - ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) ( COUGHING ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Ha ! Total surprise kidnapping ! General Grievous ! General Grievous . Take your hands off me at once ! Oh . Sorry . No , you fool . Kidnap me . Oh . Uh , yes . Sorry , boss . And stop calling me " boss " ! Poor , innocent Chancellor Palpatine . You seem troubled . Is something wrong ? No , Padmé . Just the usual rage at Obi-Wan and Yoda for not seeing my awesomeness . But I have a good feeling about us . The future is bright for me , you and our child to be . ( BEEPING ) ( R2-D2 PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC ) ( TRUMPET BLOWING ) Thanks , R2 . Have you thought of a name for the baby , yet ? PALPATINE : ( SHOUTING ) Help ! I 'm being kidnapped ! Well , the girl name is easy . Leia . Help ! Over here ! For a boy , I 've narrowed it down to ... Kidnapping in progress ! - Kidster , Embo , Wicket ... - PALPATINE : Bad guys got me ! Need a little help from the Jedi ! Jubnuk , IG-88 , or Luke . ( HORN HONKING ) The Chancellor 's been kidnapped . I have to save him , Padmé . Finally . Obi-Wan , Grievous and Dooku are holding the Chancellor - on the command ship . - OBl-WAN : I know . But why can 't we just take a straight line to get there ? 'Cause this way is much cooler . Drat ! Buzz-droids . Don 't worry . R2 's on it . ( BEEPING ) Master , what a brilliant plan of yours . To lure the Jedi to your rescue , so you can reveal yourself as the Sith Lord and have us destroy them . Uh , yeah , sure . That 's my plan . Unhand the Chancellor , Dooku ! Jedi , fire ! Time to give up , Dooku . Ha ! You just walked into a trap . We have a secret weapon you never suspected . The power of the Shh ... Get those bad guys , my Jedi heroes ! That wasn 't the plan . Yes , it was , I just didn 't tell you . Sorry . ( GRUNTING ) I 'll get you ! Yes , Anakin , yes . Give in to your hate . Isn 't that a bad thing for a Jedi ? Oh , right ! Why would I tell you to do that ? Silly me . ( LAUGHS ) But seriously , get him . ( SCREAMS ) You haven 't seen the last of me ! ( SCREAMS ) You have seen the last of me ! Great work , Anakin . Now let 's hope we survive the crash you just caused . ( ALL SCREAMING ) Grievous is out there . - I 'll hunt him . - No , Anakin . I 'll go . You 're not ready . You 're just jealous of me . I won 't accept this till I hear it from Yoda himself . Agree with Obi-Wan I do . Oh ... Oh , man , I never get any respect around here ... Anakin , you 're right to be angry at Yoda . He doesn 't see the greatness in you that I do . Really ? You think I 'm great ? Mmm-hmm , yes . And I say this from my heart , with no ulterior motives . I 'm the only friend ... Whoa , gotta go ! Trust me completely ! I think the Chancellor is the Sith Lord . Hmm . Highly unlikely . But I 'll check it out . I 'd love to help you find this General Grievous , but he 's not here . No , sir . No big , scary robot-man lurking behind that column . Is there something wrong with your neck ? ( GROANS ) Is there something wrong with your brain ? He 's trying to tell you I 'm right here . ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) It 's one against four , Jedi . - ( METAL CLANKING ) - Ow ! No problem . I 'm just as good with three . ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTS ) You are not nice ! You 're under arrest , Chancellor . Or should I say Darth Sidious ? Well , duh . - Whoa . - Get ready to say " whoa " again . Stand back a little , mmm . ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTS ) What 's going on ? Anakin , this mean Jedi is attacking poor , old me ! Eat lightning , Windu ! Help me , Anakin . Crackle , crackle ! I 'm so feeble . I don 't know what to do . You don 't ? Stop hurting my friend . ( GRUNTS ) ( SHOUTING ) Ah ! ( SCREAMING ) Oh , no . What have I done ? Kinda late to say that now . ( SCREAMING ) Congratulations , my friend . You are no longer Anakin Skywalker , second string Jedi . You are Darth Vader . The most powerful being in the galaxy . Except for me . You have to obey my every command . ( SIGHS ) I made a very bad decision . What was that , Darth Vader ? Darth Vader shall do thy bidding , my Master . ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) The Jedi will be no more . ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) Ha ! You 're doomed now , Kenobi . R means real fast , right ? Uh , sure . ( SCREAMS ) ( FADING ) Not smart ! Cody , Clone troopers , we won ! Oh , wonder where they 're going ? C-3PO : The less said about what happened next , the better . But it was a terrible day that saw the end of the Jedi , the birth of the Empire , and a fatal battle between a Master and his former apprentice . Anakin ! I loved you as a brother . But you turned to the dark side and destroyed the Republic ! I say the Jedi were destroying the Republic , and the Emperor and I saved it ! You didn 't save it . That 's a lie ! - Nah-uh ! - Ya-uh ! - Nah-uh ! - Ya-uh ! ( BOTH CONTINUE ARGUING ) What I said was true . From a certain point of view . That 's the dumbest thing I 've ever heard ! Well , as long as it 's a fight to the end , let 's make it interesting . Agreed . Hey , it 's Master Yoda . - Hi . - ( GRUNTING ) What did we ever do ? Ended your reign is , Chancellor . Or should I call you Emperor ? Or should I call you Darth ... ( SCREAMING ) Yes , yes , we all know that now . ( BOTH EXCLAIMING ) ( BOTH STRUGGLING ) ( DARTH SIDIOUS LAUGHING ) ( BOTH STRUGGLING ) JAR JAR : ( SCREAMING ) Not againsa ! ( BOTH SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) C-3PO : Anakin 's transformation into Darth Vader was complete . ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) ( BEEPING ) C-3PO : Things never looked worse for us . But , with the birth of Luke and Leia , we did have a new hope . If only I had hope that I 'd find R2 . Wait ! It 's R2 ! I 'd know his dome anywhere . But where did that thing take him ? Oh , run those images back . Uh , please , magnify it . I can 't magnify . I said , magnify ! Oh ! Mos Eisley ! That wretched stinkhole . - Oh ! I have to save him . - You 're in luck . MAN : ( ON SPEAKER ) The terminal shuttle to Mos Eisley , Mos Espa and all Moses in between is now boarding from platform 3 . Thank you . Thank you for the ride , Admiral . But , um , I must follow R2 . Of course . I 'm just happy to have my ship back . - Come back here with Daisy Mae ! - Negative , negative . C-3PO : I can 't quite believe I 'm saying this , but take me to Tatooine as fast as you can !

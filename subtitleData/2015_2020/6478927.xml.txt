 Female soldier : Towards that exit ! Cafferty : Hey ! No , don 't , don 't ! You 'll feel a little pinch . Do I have to restrain you or are we good ? We 're good . Where the hell am I ? You 're back home . Everything is gonna be okay . I 'm gonna take you to see the doctor now , all right ? Okay . Morning , Deb . Where are all the other patients ? Don 't worry , Dr. troutman is gonna answer all of your questions . Do you like what you see ? What 's happened to me ? Why am I in a hospital ? I think the bigger question is ... Do you know who you are ? Marine major John cafferty . Serial number 764246 . You 're not a captive here . Okay . Where are all the other patients ? There are no other patients , I 'm afraid . I 'm sorry ? We 're not a regular hospital . And you 're not a regular patient . Explain . Do you remember any details from your last mission ? No . No , I don 't . Do you know who these people are ? - Guts . - Sorry ? That 's guts , gutzer , Amanda gutzer . Wilkins , talbott , Carlyle , masters , Clifford , Stevens . That 's my squad . Last month your squad was sent into a remote region of Afghanistan , on a top secret retrieval mission . Two days ago , you were extracted from the pickup point , when we found you , you were all unconscious . This morning , you all woke up . So they are here too ? Yes , and we need to discover what happened . Yours was a mission of vital national security . And not only did you not return with the package , but , more importantly , three of your squad members are missing . What ? Now you say you don 't remember anything , and I believe you , but perhaps the people behind the glass don 't . There are some suspicious circumstances surrounding this incident , major . Your bosses will need to know what transpired . On a more humane level , if we don 't find the missing soldiers soon , families will need to be notified and someone will need to be blamed . So you think i had something to do with them missing ? Or that we were negligent in some way ? Those are both possibilities i would like to eliminate quickly . So why don 't you ask the rest of the squad ? I 'm sure they can clear anything up . We have . They can 't remember anything either . I wanna see them . You will , soon . First we need to perform some tests . Nurse Keller will take you . Tests ? Yes , just some general health tests at first , nothing crazy , I promise . We need to know how your body is working before we take any next steps . I 'd like to keep those pictures . Of course . Which three ? Pardon ? Which three didn 't come back ? Stevens , Clifford , Carlyle . Okay , Keller . Why don 't you and sasquatch here show me what 's next ? Hey , Keller ? Why is this place such a shithole ? Democrats . Okay , you 're doing great , are you ready for more elevation and speed ? Knock yourself out . You 're it , daddy ! Doctor : Okay , we 're good . Major ! We 're good , please . Sorry . I got lost there for a second . What if I told you i get claustrophobic ? Would you hold my hand ? I would tell you , to get over it . You 've graduated to real clothes . What is this ? While we were monitoring you during your unconscious state you were having very intense dreams . Nightmares . This should allow you to sleep through the night , I thought you 'd welcome that . So like a Xanax ? But better . What part of me are we gonna study today , Keller ? Uh , the part where we see if you can play well with others . Caff ! Hey , buddy . Can you believe this , man , they got us in the loony bin . I 'm too old for this shit . Good to see you , caff . You too . It 's good to see all of you . Wilkins . Caffy . Cafferty : Guts . Major . Every party we go to we show up wearing the same outfits . Now that you 're all reacquainted , you 'll be happy to know that your tests show you are all in excellent physical shape . Mentally , however ... Think of your brain as one big computer , it 's powered by 100 billion neurons all connected by synapses . When one of these connections is strengthened by an impulse , something you see , hear or feel , you create a memory . Much of which happens here , in the hippocampus . We learned about this in grade school , what 's the point ? Not all of us graduated from college at 16 , masters . Not all of us graduated . The point is , you all suffered a severe electromagnetic trauma to your brain . Which temporarily stopped these chemical reactions . This is what caused your collective memory loss . - Degaussing ? - Mmm . Wilkins : What ? It 's like , if you rubbed a magnet against a computer 's hard drive , you 'd lose everything . You said temporarily ? That 's right . The neurotransmitters in your brain are already reconstructing the synapses . Meaning you will get your memories back in time . The key is moderating the speed of the memory . If they come back too quickly , or all at once , it could do permanent damage to the brain . And how do we stop that from happening ? Stay calm , keep your stress low . I 've prescribed some sedatives which you should take each night before bed . That should give you the ability to sleep deeply . Which is when our bodies heal themselves . So basically we take two roofies and we 'll call you in the morning ? You 'll still have to rebuild your neural pathways , exercising active recall . We have to think about it . Exactly , and until you remember what happened in Afghanistan , you 're stuck here with me . So let 's start with what we do know , although you don 't remember the mission , you all agree that there was one . Cafferty : Yeah . Yeah . Dr. troutman : We lost track of you for almost two days when you entered the target zone , you were only rescued because it was a failsafe extraction point . Anybody have something to add ? Listen , all I 'm trying to do is trigger your memory . The sooner I can do that , the sooner you can go back to your lives and your families . So any piece , any fragment of a memory , could be that trigger . No matter how insignificant it may seem to you . Just talking helps . Those empty chairs should be filled with your missing squad members . Think of their families . Talbott : I remember there was a little boy . Cafferty : And the contact , we were supposed to meet a contact . Move , move ! Yeah , move , move ! Move ! Cafferty : Go , go , go , go ! Hey , watch your step . Talbott : Is that it , caffy ? Cafferty : Okay , down this way , down this way , come on ! Cafferty : All right , I 'll check the Ridge . Wilkins : I don 't see anything . Cafferty : Come on , keep going , keep your eyes on ! Come on , come on , come on , go , go , go , go ! I 'm going in ! Talbott : Clear ! Clear ! Stevens : Clear ! Carlyle : Clear ! Clear ! Clear ! There 's nobody here , caff . Cafferty : Talbott , check the perimeter . The Taliban gotta be somewhere . Come on ... We got movement all over us ! Cover , cover , cover ! Jeez ! Cafferty : Get down , Clifford , cover ! Masters : Watch your back ! Cafferty : Return fire ! Carlyle : Captain , we 're surrounded ! Cafferty : Let 's go , let 's go ! Well , maybe they 're not all over ! Woo ! You okay , caff ? Ah , migraines . Wilkins ! You sure this is the right village ? This is the only village . The contact is supposed to be here . This place is a ghost town . Someone tipped them off . Carlyle : They 're everywhere , go ! Stevens : Go , over the hill ! Cafferty : Okay , listen up , listen up ! We 've gotta watch our ammo , we may be stuck here for a while ! - Talbott : Copy ! - Guts : Copy that . Okay , right , especially you , guts . Long distance isn 't your thing . Who says ? Everyone says . Wow ! Hey , try to toss a ' nade out there . It was my grandfather 's . He fought rommel in world war ii . Didn 't get a scratch on him . It 's my lucky charm . Okay , well we can use as many of those as we can get . Carlyle , still no luck ? Att must cover these mountains . Oh , we 're locked into the world 's shittiest contract . Those Taliban pricks ! They 're moving closer ! Stevens : Damn , look out ! How many is that ? Twelve . Brother Jack would be proud . Yeah . - Ah , shit ! - Stevens : Damn it , Clifford ! Medic ! I 'm okay ! Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Don 't even think about it . - Too late . - Go for the top ! Goddammit ! Cafferty : Oh , shit . Oh , no . Shit . Hey ! Hey ! Come on , now get on your feet . I 'm good ! We gotta pull back , asap , caff , they 're flanking us . Masters , move , I 'll cover you ! Carlyle 's down ! We gotta move , any ideas ? Yeah , why don 't you piss off ? Really ? Masters : I got heat signatures , and significant electrical readings just to the north of here . Listen up ! In the winter these villages sometimes move into the caves . The contact must be there . Stevens , rally . Rally , rally , rally , rally ! Rally up , get moving , talbott . Guts : Go , go , go , go ! Stevens : Come on , let 's go ! Move , move , move ! Stevens : Wilkins ! Easy , easy , easy , talbott . Jesus , talbott , it 's just a kid . What 's your name , where did you come from ? Cafferty : Wilkins ? He 's clean , caffy . Hey . Masters : What about Carlyle ? Stevens put him into cover . Roger that . We 'll come back for him . He 's leading us in the right direction at least . Cafferty : Ryan ... Ryan ! Ryan . Ryan ! Shit . Where did that kid even come , man , I could 've shot him . You didn 't shoot him . Well , how do you know ? I mean , does anybody remember what happened next ? I don 't remember shit , man , I 'm in the ambush and , and the kid- - okay , Ryan , listen , buddy , I remember , you didn 't shoot him . Okay , buddy ? - Okay . - Okay , man . I think we 're done for the day . I agree . With such memory loss it 's important to take it slow , we will get your memories back , please be sure . What about you ? What do you remember ? Guts : I 've got nothing . Come on , guts , you must 've remembered something . It was dark . We were all there . Weapons drawn , ready for the shit . And ? We were all trying to kill each other . Wonderland here I come . Violet : Daddy ! Violet : You 're it , daddy ! I 'm over here ! Follow me , daddy ! Violet ? Violet ! Violet . Violet : Daddy . Violet , is anyone here ? Violet : This way ! Where are you , daddy ? I 'm over here . You never came back ! Traitor ! Is that all you 're eating ? Please , this place is hardly a vegetarian paradise . What ? Ryan . How you doing , buddy ? Oh , I 'm all aces . Hey , have you ever seen any of these before ? No . No , I haven 't . Fuck ! Ryan ! Major cafferty , good morning . I 'd like to try an experiment on you with your permission . No , thanks . I think you 'll find it to your liking . Listen , doc , I 'm not your rat in a maze . It 's your wife . Trudy . She 's come to see you . Trudy ? We 've kept the families away so far , as again , we 're trying to control the flow of memories as best we can . But I feel you are ready for this test . Maybe talking to your wife will rekindle those memories we 're searching for . John . My poor baby . I 've missed you so much . Hi , Trudy . Of course . Yeah , so it 's true . What 's that ? You don 't remember me . I wish I did . It 's okay . I brought something for you . Okay . This is your daughter , Violet . I never forgot her . That 's ... That 's just great , John . Do you have more ? Well , they specifically told me to only bring recent shots , something about moving ... Slow ? - Yeah . - Yeah . Sounds about right . I 'll bring more next time , i promise . I just ... I 'm so glad that you 're safe and I 'm sorry , and that you 're being so well taken care off . Yeah . It 's a regular summer camp around here . Now that sounds like the John cafferty I know . Dr. troutman said that I can come back in a couple of days . Okay ? I just ... I want you to know that I am here for you . No matter how long that it takes for you to get better . I love you . Cafferty : Come on , sleep . Talbott : Jesus , get off of me ! Molester ! Just , just , just get off ! - Let go of me ! Shh , shotgun . You like that , huh ? Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! You fucking ... Ryan . Hey , buddy , it 's just caff . Are you coming to kill me ? No , what are you talking about ? I killed that kid , man . No , no , no , no , you didn 't . No you didn 't , I was there . You see it , man . You see it ! See what ? Ryan , see what ? Listen , we talked about this , remember ? The kid led us to the cave . The source of this signal is definitely coming from in there . Which means that there 's people down there , or at least there used to . If they don 't hold out for the winter , they 're out of supplies . And they may be armed to the teeth . Well we can 't stay here out in the open . We 've lunged into scarier holes than this . Let 's see what we find inside . Let me get the rear . See ya , kid . Talbott : That kid 's been haunting me every night since then , no , I must 've killed him . This is my mind 's way of dealing with what I 've done ! Well , listen to me , okay ? Listen , Ryan , you didn 't do it . Your goggles were fucked up , that 's all buddy . Your goggles were fucked up , that 's all ! Yeah , but we killed them all , caff . What are you talking ... What are you talking about ? Ah , fuck ! This memory loss thing , that was such a gift at first , you know ? It allowed me to believe that i was some sort of good guy . You are good , Ryan . Ryan , you 're good . No , I am so far from good . When you do bad things in life , slowly , one at a time , it 's like this trail of shit behind you , but you just keep going because you can 't smell it , you know ? But when someone takes all of that shit and rains it down on you in one fucking moment , all those people I killed , all that pain , all at once . It 's too much . No one gets a second chance . No , no , no , buddy , we can get through this . It 's okay , don 't , no , Ryan , no , no , no ! Ryan , ah ! No , Ryan ! Oh , god . Oh , Ryan ... Ryan , help ! Help me ! Okay , buddy , just hold on . Help me ! Dr. troutman : We 're all deeply sorry for the loss of Ryan . But this is what happens when you try to move too quickly , your memories can manifest themselves in dreams , and almost seem real , even waking dreams are possible . Ryan was refusing to take his medications . When his memories returned they consequently overwhelmed him . He was always a bit unstable . For Christ sakes , masters . Hey , I liked the guy . Just saying he was always a bit twitchy . Has anyone else been having nightmares ? There 's no shame if you have . Come on you little purple bastard , work . No , please , no ... No , please ! Rise and shine ! You really know how to ease someone into the day . Well , I know you have a strong ticker . So what 's on the agenda today ? Ah , more group therapy . But the good news is , your wife 's here to see you again . Trudy : Do you remember that rain ? It was torrential . It didn 't stop you from kissing me . Some people walk in the rain . Other people get wet . Right , so our honeymoon hasn 't seeped it 's way into your thick skull yet ? I 'm sorry . Listen , how 's Violet ? It 's weird , you know , i keep having these dreams or reflections , or I don 't know what , but she was in one and she was in a car , so , I was just wondering if she 's- - no , no , no , she 's , she 's fine . Sure misses her daddy , but she 's fine . Yeah , like , she 's okay ? Yes , she is okay . She 's safe . I 'm not supposed to ask you these kind of questions , but , what do you think happened to you over there ? I 'd tell you if I knew . I wish I did . I believe you . Sorry to break up you two lovebirds , but , visiting time is over . Of course . Whatever you do , don 't stop hugging me and act normal . I 'm not your wife . Stop taking the meds , trust no one . I can 't wait until you can come home . Me too . Don 't blame yourself . He was a marine . The only reason he had a chance was because you were there . Why were you there ? You weren 't knocked out in a purple haze ? I don 't sleep for shit . And I don 't like it when I do . What about you , how are you sleeping ? Sleeping is not the problem , it 's the dreams . Nice move . I have lots of nice moves . But you 'll never experience any of them . Oh , yeah ? But you can 't know for sure that I haven 't . Trust me . I know . I 'm thinking about not taking the meds . So you can slice yourself up like talbott ? They just don 't seem to be working for me . What 's real and in my head , is blurring . Caff , we 've only been taking them for less than a week . Stay on course . Yeah . I 'll do that . What 's going on ? New protocols since the talbott incident . I have to ensure that you take your medication . So , if you don 't mind . Sure . Thanks . Just doing my job . You got it . I don 't know which way to go , it could be either . Well we 're officially out of rations , so , if you flip a coin , make sure it lands the right way up . Blaine ... Where were you ? Jack ? Follow me . Where are you going , Stevens ? Stevens ! Clifford , with me . The rest of you figure out which way to go . What 's going on , Blaine ? My brother , Jack . I swear to god , I saw him . Your brother 's dead , man . Has been for six months now , remember ? You 're just tired and hungry like the rest of us . Yeah . I guess so . Younger brothers , they always wanna follow your footsteps . But he was never cut out for this crap . Let 's go . Okay . Jack : Blaine . There . Jack ! I 'm coming . Come over here ... Caff ! Fuck those meds ! Wait , that 's what she said ? Yeah , and to trust no one . Something else is happening here , I just ... I can 't put my finger on it . But if she 's not your wife , then who is she ? I don 't know , I don 't know . But I think there 's a way I can find out . What are you thinking ? That first day , that I was brought to group . Yeah ? I saw a hallway with a door at the end of it , cardkey security setup , like an employees only thing . Like there might be offices back there ? Like even troutman 's office . Yeah , exactly . And information might be back there . So tomorrow night , let 's find a way in there . Why wait ? You heard the part about the cardkey right ? Make some noise . What ? Guts : Make some noise . Cafferty : Someone help me ! I need help ! What the hell is going on here ? I saw her here , she 's losing it , she says she 's hearing voices . I 'll take her back to her room . I did hear voices . I did hear voices . I heard voices . I heard voices . Where did you learn to pick a pocket like that ? I 'm from cape town , it 's hereditary . You don 't have anything to pick . Right . This must be the republican side . Guts : What , majestic global dynamics ? They make halliburton look like a lemonade stand . So we 're definitely not in a military hospital . You noticed those security guys ? Mm . Our orderlies . Let 's find troutman 's office . Come on . Every corner we go around I expect to see a giant chunk of cheese . Let 's stop playing Russian roulette out here . We could come back , we 're not prepared . Ye of little faith . Guts . What the ... ? Who 's that ? That 's my wife . Trudy , my real wife . Oh ... Yeah ... I don 't think I 've met her . That must be your daughter . Who 's the lady with her ? Trudy 's sister , Sasha . Yeah , she 's a bit of a train wreck , but she , uh , she helps out along with Violet . Something to fight for . How the hell does a company like majestic global dynamics extract a squad of U.S. marines out of Afghanistan ? Because we 're not U.S. marines . What ? We 're all ex-military . Part of some mercenary outfit called painkillers . Why would we think we were U.S. marines ? That was our cover , it makes sense , that 's what we would remember first . Majestic just can 't send in their mercenaries on a whim , they need permission . Obviously they didn 't get it . So they sent us in unofficially . Which means that no one may actually know that we 're here . Okay , our mission was the power source . That was the package . What are these ? Talbott was doodling these , I didn 't recognize them at first . But I remember now . We were deep in the cave , and then , then we reached a dead end . My readings say that all this energy is coming from somewhere right around here . Then there 's gotta be another path . There isn 't another path . It all ends in a wall . Guts : Are you all right ? Get that man an aspirin . Yeah , yeah , it 'll pass . Clifford : There 's nothing here . These walls , they 're different . Clifford : How are cave walls different ? You see where the sides hit the ground ? It 's regular , usually they 're all broken up . Like these . Masters : Caff , over here , i found some markings . What is that , Egyptian ? Traces of it . Greek as well . There 's also some quantum-mechanical drawings on here . Wow ! Cafferty : What is this ? - Try the other ones . - Clifford : Yeah ... What the heck ? It 's a code . It 's just about order . Right . I remember these symbols . It just stops there . Keep looking for clues . Guts , I don 't believe you 've met my lovely bride . She looks like a real charmer . When should I break her neck ? If I ever let you go , are you gonna scream ? No , no . What 's your real name ? Louise . Louise Griffin . Why did you pretend to be my wife ? It was troutman 's idea . It was a test to see if you really had amnesia . He knew how much you loved her , so he thought , you might open up to her more easily . What 's the angle then , on telling me what you did today ? There 's no angle . Listen , I work for majestic , I am a chemical engineer who just happens to look similar to your wife , okay ? I came here to do good things . I just , i couldn 't stand by and watch what was happening to you , so I felt that if i could just warn you . Sounds like a crock of shit to me . No , no , listen to me ! I was right about the meds , so you know I 'm not lying . Let her go , guts . They 're not sedatives , are they ? They 're the exact opposite . The pill is an experimental memory repair drug . Memories are the result of chemical reactions in your brain . Which in your cases , got shut off , it 's like a power outage . So the pill turns it back on . And then some , the more you take , the more powerful it becomes , until eventually the brain snaps , psychotic rages , depression , a total fry-out . Like talbott . And tomorrow they 're upping the dosage . What , why ? There 's too much heat . Majestic is under investigation by the justice department , they 're running out of time . I overheard katuro informing troutman that he has two more days to figure this out . Wait a minute , katuro who 's that ? Yanis katuro , he 's president of majestic global dynamics . So two more days before they kill us all ? They 'd rather pull the plug on this entire facility than have what they do here go public . Okay , can you let my wife and daughter know that I am okay . Please . I 'll see what I can do . Sasquatch probably knows his guard is missing . What are we gonna do about her ? Trust her . She took a big risk telling me what she did . I believe her . She 's messing with you , man . Guard : This is 57 , I 'm investigating ... There 's security . Man : Investigate , report back . Ms. Griffin , is everything okay ? Yeah , you know I 'm fine , I 'm just a little clumsy . I was leaving some reports on the doctor 's desk for him to look over in the am . Okay then . Our timetable has shifted , we need to move tonight . Does anyone have anything to say before we break up for today ? Major cafferty , anything from you ? No . I 've decided to add a round of sedatives for today , it seems none of you are sleeping well . This will help . All right then . Have a good night , everyone . I just turned into every girl I hated in high school . Do you think troutman knows . We put everything back . So we can spar , but , uh , I gotta get on the bike first and get limbered up . That 's because you 're an old man , major . What do you think troutman knows ? Hey , nothing matters right now except finding a way out of here . Let 's update masters and Wilkins . Tonight , we 're getting the hell out of here . Wilkins ! Wilkins ! Wilkins ! Shit . It 's always been about you . Wilkins , whatever you 're feeling , it 's the drugs , okay , they 're not sedatives . You fucking traitor ! Wilkins . Masters ! - That 's it , that 's it . - Guts : Caff ! Okay . How is he ? Is he okay ? What ? Okay , we 've gotta get him back to my room . You take masters , I 'll take him . Come on , I got her . Huh , huh ? Masters : Remember ? Shit , what just happened ? Like Louise said , they upped the dosages , their brains are frying . Masters ? Look at me . Look at me . How are you feeling ? What 's happening ? I need you to listen , carefully , we 're not in a military facility , and some bad people are trying to figure out what happened to us down in that tunnel . Tunnel , I remember a tunnel . The Taliban were chasing us . Oh , and then there were these ... I could feel them ... And then there was this , there was this light , there was this blinding light . And it was all I could see . I don 't know why any of this matters anymore . Why can 't we just go home ? Where 's Wilkins ? He found a way out of here . Oh ... Lucky son of a bitch . Oh , my head is killing me . What 's next , caff ? We need to figure out how to get out of this building . All the doors are sealed shut . Unless we find a way to the majestic side . Oh , what about the kitchen ? In high school I used to work in an industrial cafeteria , my boyfriend and I did , Karl , and we used to make out in the back , he liked it when I left my hairnet on . Janey , you try to concentrate , okay , what about the kitchen ? An industrial cafeteria has point of sale software installed on it . Okay , which means what ? They track what the students are buying and the machine is usually connected to the same network as the rest of the building . So is this one . Which means I can find us a way in . When we were in high school i made sure that Karl got straight as and we barely went to class . That was until he cheated on me and his grades took a precipitous drop . - Oh . - Yes , okay . This room , this looks like some kind of fire escape , this is right by here , this is probably our best chance , come on . Guts , let 's go . Shit . What 's the plan here ? We get outside , we get outta here . Did I ever mention you come up with the shittiest plans ? Now you know why i got out of the military . No long-term thinking . Okay , come on . This is the way . Guts : Do you know the code ? Masters : Like if . How are we gonna get in there ? Please , there 's only so many variations . Guard : You can get your ammunition in room c , over , uh , down the hallway . Whatever you do , make it snappy . Come on , janey . What 's that for ? I might have to take care of some of sasquatch 's friends . We gotta move , ladies . Come on , come on ! They must know we 're out of our room by now . They still won 't know exactly what we 're up to . Neither do we . Shh . Guard : Yeah , yeah , yeah , don 't worry about it . The room we need to get to is at the end of this hall . The only way past is through those guys . There must be a way we could sneak by them . Sneak by a couple of janitors ? Give me a break . Heya , fellas . Shit . You guys aren 't actually janitors are you ? This is Sergio . We got an eyeball on one of the guys . Oh , come on . You gotta admit , they looked just like janitors . Okay , up here , up here , come on . - Okay , you 're next . - You first , I 'm back . Not acceptable . Guts : It 's all clear , go ! Masters : I got you ! Guts : Come on , come on . Cafferty : Give me your arm ! Get out of the way , get out of the way ! Get back , get back ! Shit , shit ... Guts , take a look . Empty fields , there 's five lots close , but nothing else , and there 's another building , it looks like a satellite dish on top . Okay , can you walk on it ? It 's not broken . Give me a few minutes to loosen it up . Okay , you stay here with masters , I 'm gonna do a little recon , see if I can use that satellite to make a call . You 've got ten minutes . Cafferty : Deal . What just happened ? Masters : The cliffs , the wall just disappeared . Cafferty : If it was ever there in the first place . It 's off the charts . Dr. troutman : Caff . Cafferty . Cafferty ! Oh , there he is . That 's right . This is where it all started . You know there 's never been anyone on the other side , right ? This has always been my show . What are you after ? What you were supposed to get in the first place . The power source . Finally . You know I was worried there at the beginning , i thought you were playing some sort of game with me but you really didn 't remember anything . What is it ? You know how majestic was founded ? When it really hit its stride ? 1947 . There was a little incident in roswell , new Mexico . We were commissioned by the government to reverse-engineer what was found there . Ten years later , we have kevlar and stealth technology , and majestic global dynamics is very , very rich . What does that have to do with this ? We started picking up major spikes in electromagnetic energy in that area about 20 years ago , the Russians even before that . The same kind of energy as at roswell . Only on a much larger scale . Now there 's some sort of device down there , that can generate power from within itself from nothing . From a source we 've never known about . Well , you 've got the entire oil industry now , null and void . That would shake the power structure of this world . That 's why the Russians went into Afghanistan in the first place , they beat us to the punch . So why did you just decide to go after it now ? Now ? John we and the Russians have been sending people in there for the last 20 years . Your squad are just the first to ever come back . And imagine our frustration when you come back empty-handed and all indications showing that the device is gone . The opportunity of a lifetime , gone , and you don 't even have the grace to remember what happened . You were gonna kill us either way . Weren 't you ? You wouldn 't want anyone to know . They forced you to share it with the rest of the world and not use it for personal interest and profit . That 's right . Troutman , when I get outta here , I 'm gonna kill you for what you 've done to my crew . That 's rich , yeah , really , John , it is . You 're trying to make me out to be the bad guy . Oh , John . You 've been a part of this mission from the beginning . You planned it . You picked the crew . I 'm not the bad guy , John . You are . The energy coming out of this thing is ... It 's extraordinary . This must be what the contact was gonna direct us to . What is this place ? Oh , my god . Oh , my god , what did you do ? My job . Put the weapon down , soldier . Put it down , or I 'll put you down you twitchy bastard . You may wanna take back that last comment , you fucking beaner . I 'm south African you douche . Good for you . What 's going on here , caff ? Put your weapons on the ground , slowly . I don 't understand , he just murdered Clifford , caff , you can 't let him do that . Yes , he can . There was no contact , was there ? You are the contact . You and talbott knew we were coming here this whole time . Woo , winner , winner , chicken dinner . Or is that a fajita for you ? How much , caff ? How much are your friend 's lives worth to you ? How much ? Dr. troutman : Did they know about that tumor in your head ? That you were already a dead man ? That you sold your soul so your poor neglected kid could have a college fund ? Hey , five million bucks , she could go to a bunch of colleges . Or maybe she ends up a slacker , and blows it all on sex and drugs . There 's the cafferty I know , cold-blooded killer . And it gets better . You noticed you haven 't had any migraines since you 've returned . When you first got back i had your brain scanned , guess what ? That inoperable brain tumor of yours , it 's gone . Whatever happened in that cave did more than just wipe your memory clean . What 's your point , troutman ? My point is that all the betrayal and all the sacrifice , you didn 't need to do any of it at all . Guts : How much are your friend 's lives worth ? How much are your friend 's lives worth to you ? Oh , my nonexistent superior being . Yeah , it 's absorbed his energy . Talbott : I 'll kill you , Wilkins ! Masters : This thing is gonna blow ! Move ! What was that for ? I owed you one . - One ? - Yeah . What the hell is that thing ? It 's the package , when I touched it some kind of auto-destruct function must have been triggered . Whoever made that thing doesn 't want anybody to have it . Wilkins : Masters , let 's get out of here ! Guts , we gotta get outta here . Come on , caff , let 's finish this job . It 's over , talbott , we just need to get outta here . I follow orders , man . Retrieve the package , eliminate the rest . Caff , let 's get out of here ! We found the others . Time to go talk to the lost little lambs . However , don 't worry . You 're still going to die . I wouldn 't like to think of all that angst going to waste . Farewell . You 're a pussy . Is that all you 've got ? You 're such an imbecile , you don 't even know why you 're doing this . Oh , yeah , hence the anger in you . Enough . Leave us . Where is cafferty ? Why do you care ? He doesn 't care about you . Bullshit . Why do you think he left you behind ? Cafferty is on our side , has been from the start . He would never betray us . Search your memories . You know it 's true . You 'll feel a little pinch . Cafferty : Don 't you move . I was just doing my job , I was just doing my job . Guts : Caff ! Caff ... Caff . You sold us out in Afghanistan . You were going to kill us . What happened to you ? My wife is dead . And has been for a year . A car accident . Trudy died , but Violet made it . And I wasn 't there for them . I was away on a mission . She and I have been estranged for a year now . You know how it is . Six months away , no contact . And when you do talk to them , you can 't even tell them what you just spent half a year doing , because it 's top secret . You miss all the important stuff too with your kid . The good stuff . Violet apparently loves balloons . But I 've never had the chance to buy her any . I kept telling myself , that one of these days , I 'm gonna stop this insane life that I 'm living . And I 'm gonna fix my marriage , and I 'm gonna be a great dad . They found a brain tumor in my last physical . Six months to live . Tops . The migraines ... So only one of these days , is none of these days . Now my baby girl was gonna be alone . And I 'd done nothing for her . Nothing . So they offered me a deal . That would take care of her for the rest of her life . In exchange for pulling the trigger on ours ? Yeah . You have every right to kill me , masters . But you didn 't do it . You didn 't pull the trigger . You saved my life . You better not let me down . We gotta get outta here . Guard : There they are ! Guard : Let 's get ' em . They 're getting away . Come on , come on ! It 's all right , caff , go ! Jane ! I 'll go down swinging . Guard : Come on . Shit . Come on , she gave us some time , let 's use it . Let 's blow this place up . This is where they make those damn pills . This is where they make everything . If we can download their files , we can bring majestic to its knees . Shit , I can 't make any sense of this , guts , get over here and help me . Guts ? Amanda ? She had fire , I 'll give her that . Don 't shoot in here goddammit . Take him . Cafferty : Troutman . I 've had enough of you . Cafferty : You can 't possibly think you can take me . I don 't , but I 'm fairly certain he can . Who says long distance isn 't my thing ? You can 't kill me . They 'll come after you . I 'm needed . Not anymore . You 'll feel a little pinch . Guts : Towards that exit ! Cafferty : Hey ! No , don 't , don 't ! Do you think masters and Wilkins made it ? I hope so . Let 's go . Fine , yeah . Fuck , guts , do you still have your grandfather 's grenade ? Yeah , but it 's at least 60 years old . What have we got to lose ? - Okay . - Come on ! Get down , get down ! Woo ! Go , go , go ! I got you . Hey . Louise : Major cafferty . Major cafferty ! Too many of you , I give up . No , I 'm here to help you , I was undercover , I work for the justice department . What your team accomplished in six days , I couldn 't do in six years . You 're a hero , major . Listen , save her . Let 's go , let 's go . Okay . That 's right . Let 's go . Get her up . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Okay , guts , hey . One of these days , go find your daughter . Yeah , okay . Get her out of here . Sasha : That was a really good one . Look at you ! Oh , we can go back to playing with our tea , pretend . Violet : It 's so lovely . Man : How many more signals have we located ? Woman : Six , two more in the middle east , two in south America , one in Europe , and one in the Canadian rockies . All desolate locations . Man : I want this thing , send out teams . Who was the man who took down troutman ? Woman : John cafferty . Man : Bring him to me , I 'd like to have a word .

 Babs ? Yeah , alright , fine . This is my last bet . Let 's make it a hundred quid a second . Nice knowing you too , Seamus . What have I missed ? - You sure you 're with us now ? - Yes . Female , IC1 , fatal gunshot wound . Any witnesses ? The neighbor heard the shot but was too scared to investigate . But she remembers a boyfriend coming round earlier in the night , loud music and furniture banging just before . Domestic gone horribly wrong ? Most likely , except the weapon is very unusual . In what way ? It 's an antique flintlock pistol . My guess is it 's Napoleonic , very rare . Excuse me . What 's the matter ? It 's my brother 's girlfriend . Is that weapon from Rich 's shop , Harry ? I 'm gonna find him . Rich . - You guys here already ? - Yeah . - Look , I didn 't do anything , Harry . - I know . Listen to me . This is really important . You need to tell me exactly what happened . Some guy came round for dinner . Um , Duncan ... Duncan Ortiz . He 'd been in contact with Babs . He said he 'd got something he wanted to show her . She was really excited . Some Tang Dynasty dragon or something . Then what ? Then I woke up and I was holding the flintlock and ... - " Babs was dead . - It 's alright . You tell them just what you told me , word for word . It 's gonna be OK . So how did Harry react ? - It was his brother 's girlfriend , so ... - Mm . Yes , it 's gonna be difficult for him . How about you ? Sir ? Well , Orwell 's gonna run it , but I 'd still like you to be the second on this . Oh . But I understand if you feel too close to it , because of your ... your connection with Harry . No , it 's OK . I 'll do it . You 'll be OK . I 'll see you in a few hours . Thanks . I 'll take it from here , Harry . - Harry . - Come here . OK . I 'll get a few details and we 'll get you a strong coffee , yeah ? So , Orwell 's working it ? With DS Chohan . - I 'm glad it 's someone I can trust . - WINTER : So am I. Harry , I 'm afraid you 're just gonna have to let them get on with it . Right . Do let them get on with it , Harry . We found this in Miss Haleton 's bedside drawer . - What is it ? - ORWELL : GHB . Liquid ecstasy . It has your fingerprints all over it . Can you explain that ? No . Carry on , Mr Clayton . What happened next ? You were drinking and then ... ? I remember the doorbell ringing . Barbara went and answered it . - It must have been Ortiz . - What did he look like ? - Tall . - Tall ? That 's it ? That 's all I remember . I remember he and Babs talking about Tang era stuff . And then they ... they looked in a book together and ... And you definitely don 't remember arguing with Miss Haleton ? No . We didn 't argue . Well , you 're maintaining that you didn 't shoot Miss Haleton , so why run away from the scene as if you did ? I was pa ... panicked . I ... I was terrified . I went to find my brother . The pistol is a flintlock antique from your shop , isn 't it ? Yes . How did it get to Miss Haleton 's apartment if you didn 't bring it with you ? I don 't know . It should have been in my lockup . I rotate the stock if it isn 't selling and the flintlocks had been sitting on the shelf for months . They come as a pair . Go to the lockup . They must have been stolen . You 'll find fingerprints or ... or ... or something . Is that the ballistics report on Rich ? You 've read it already , haven 't you ? ( SIGHS ) Harry . The gunpowder residue found on Rich was clustered around his right hand . I know how to read a ballistics report Rich is left-handed . Someone must have put the gun in his hand and forced him to fire it . Or maybe he used both hands and his right hand took most of the residue . That 's unlikely . Being anywhere near this will compromise your brother 's case . You won 't help him . You 'll hurt him . He 's left-handed , and the gunpowder residue , there 's so much more than what appeared on his hand . You 're gonna keep going round and round with this . - HARRY : Suri , please . - Chohan . Give me some room , Harry , please . - Harry bothering you ? - No . Think I don 't know he 's monitoring every detail of this ? - It 's his brother . - Suri , you 're a smart detective . You don 't need Harry Clayton doing your thinking for you . Now , look at this . This is the first time CCTV captures Richard Clayton , about five minutes from Haleton 's flat . Just give it a second . - He changed direction . - No . This is ten minutes later . SURI : He went back for his jacket . Not so panicked after all , huh ? - It 's not good , Harry . - I can see that . - What about the ballistics report ? - Wouldn 't convince a jury . Suri 's right . Any gunpowder residue is enough . He needs something to back up his story , something conclusive to prove that this other person was there . Well , I don 't think that finding this other person is top of Orwell 's agenda . Well , do you blame him ? Would you believe Rich if he wasn 't your brother ? That 's not helping . It 's how they 're thinking , Harry . It 's how the evidence is making them think . Oh , God almighty . I 'm sorry . How 's he coping ? He 's not . I 'd better get back . Ta . JOSIE : What 's Rich meant to have done ? SURI : We can 't tell you that . This is where the Napoleonic guns are . They haven 't been checked out . Do you know if Rich had any ammunition for these guns ? What ? I don 't know . - You knew the guns weren 't here . - SURI : Steve . This is from the London Museum of Chinese History . Haleton was a consultant there . Well , there 's your motive . He stole this , she found out , he stopped her from telling anyone . JOSIE : You think Rich shot Babs ? No . Suri , Rich would never do anything like that . ORWELL : The question is just when to introduce this . - And his testimony . - What 's that ? I think you should follow Winter 's advice and leave us to it , Harry . It 's a Ming Dynasty vase , stolen from the Museum of Chinese History , recovered from Rich 's lockup . This is bollocks . - Suri , can I have five minutes ? - We 're busy . Don 't be a bigger arsehole than you already are . - Suri ? - Five minutes . - He 's being set up . - Why ? I don 't know . Please . What about this guy Ortiz ? There 's only one Duncan Ortiz in the UK . He lives in Sunderland , he 's 84 years old and he 's just had hip surgery . Whoever 's doing this to him wouldn 't use their real name anyway . I have to look at the facts . There 's no forensic evidence anyone else was in that flat or handled that gun . You know Rich . You 've spent time with him . He 's not even a thief , never mind a murderer . Rich isn 't gonna murder someone over a friggin ' vase . Yes , I did go back , but to get my coat . My phone was in my coat . I needed to call Harry . ORWELL : So you calmly went back into the scene of the crime to retrieve a phone , and even then you don 't call the police ? My brother is the police . WOMAN : No , don 't ! Stop ! Help , please ! - ( GROANS ) - Miss . Miss . Someone ... Someone knocked me down . He stole my phone . Can you describe him ? ( MUMBLES ) Sorry , I think I , um ... I hit my ... my head quite hard when I ... Oh , shit . I feel really stupid doing that to you . No worries . SURI : Mr Clayton , we 've got your prints on the murder weapon that came from your shop , ballistic evidence of you firing the gun , GHB in your bloodstream , CCTV evidence of you returning calmly to the scene ... I wasn 't calm . I wasn 't in my right mind . Surely you can see that . ... a Ming era antiquity stolen from Miss Haleton 's work in your lockup , none of which you can explain . I didn 't kill her , Suri . SURI : It 's not enough for you to say it , Mr Clayton . You 've given us nothing to make us believe you . You have to believe me . No , I don 't , Mr Clayton . I don 't know what happened with you and Barbara Haleton last night . Nor do I know what went through your mind the moments before you pulled that trigger . Whether the GHB you 'd both taken had pushed you into an altered state or if it had just enhanced the feelings of hatred you had for her already . No , no , no , that 's not true . I ... I loved her . But the ballistic evidence tells me you did pull that trigger and I don 't think you 're even denying that , are you ? - I don 't know what happened . - ORWELL : Listen . An early confession will help , Rich . It will significantly affect the back end of your sentence . Gonna give you some time to think about it . You were excellent in there . He 's gonna crack by tonight . Harry . - Check page 89 for prints . - Will do . Alright , come on , then . After you , darling . We 've actually just managed to place a former inmate at a two-Michelin star restaurant . - Hm . - Not bad for a works canteen , eh ? Oh , there 's something I should tell you . I had an ulterior motive for agreeing to be a mentor here . Well , I was rather hoping you 'd say that . I 'm serious . - Kevin Grey . - I need to know what happened to him . And ? What have you found out ? Another prisoner gave me a name . And the name they gave you was Golding , yes ? I 've heard that name too . I 'm not stupid , Anna . You don 't usher in one of the best bloody lawyers into your prison when they 've just lost a client in there without expecting they will ask some questions . You know how proud I am of the work we 're doing here . But Whitecross is still Whitecross . There are serious problems here , just like in every other prison in the country . You can 't expect me just to let it rest . Of course not . I just don 't want you to feel that you 're alone in this . I want to find out who Golding is just as much as you do . ( SIGHS ) Great . That 's great . - Thank you . - Good . So , what 's Daisy up to this evening ? She 's at a sleepover . So why don 't you come over ? ( PHONE RINGS ) Hello ? OK , I 'll have a look . Thanks . HARRY : I know who 's behind all this . Charles Collins . Golding . What can you tell me about him ? Who ? My brother is going to jail for a murder he had nothing to do with . Give me something on Collins . I know you don 't wanna see my brother hurt I don 't know who you mean , honestly . ( PHONE RINGS ) COLLINS : Hello , Kaleem . - Clayton knows your name . - How do you know that ? He just stopped me in the street . And you thought the best course of action would be to call my private number directly afterwards ? No , no , no , he 's gone . This line is completely secure . Goodbye , Kaleem . Shit . ( PHONE RINGS ) Hold on . Won 't be a minute . Harry , I think they 're gonna charge me . - Do you recognize this man ? - Sir , you can 't talk to him . - That 's him . - Who ? Ortiz . That 's Duncan Ortiz . OK , hang in there . I 'm gonna get you out . - Everyone says I should confess . - Don 't . You 're innocent . - Sir , please . - What the hell is going on here ? - Pete , get him in there . - Harry . It 's alright . Say nothing , alright ? - Suri ... - How can you do this ? I have found the man that did this to Rich and Babs . I just needed Rich to confirm it . He has . This is him . - SURI : What are you talking about ? - Look at him . Don 't you recognize him ? This is the guy that was working for Sasha Terekhova at the yacht , remember ? Charles Collins . He 's ex-military , ex-MI6 . He now runs a private security firm . He killed Babs and framed Rich . How 'd you figure this out ? Did Rich in the interview mention anything about looking at an art book when Ortiz was at Babe 's flat ? Yeah , of course he did . Charles Collins 's print 's on page 89 . It 's got a picture of a jade dragon on it . He 's in the system , ABH ten years ago , suspended sentence . And where 'd you find this book ? At the crime scene . Suri , he 's my brother . I 've no choice but to do everything I can ... No , you do have a choice . You 're just too far gone to make it . I don 't care ! It 's him , I know it . It 's the truth . The truth ? Jesus , Harry , you haven 't told me the truth for months now . Everything you do these days breaks down any procedure I 'm supposed to work by . Rich is innocent ! Look at the amount of evidence against him . Charles Collins is capable of arranging all that . CPS have approved our case . Rich is gonna be charged in the morning . What ? You would have charged him too if you were still the cop I started with . Well , we all change . - ( BEEPING ) - Excuse me , sir . - Excuse me . - Police . Out of the way . - Sir , sir , sir ! - Police . Look . Look ! Oh , I 'm sorry . We 've got some interesting solutions for you . Well , I bloody hope so . The minister of state is absolutely losing her mind . Mr Collins . Mr Undersecretary . Lovely to meet you . I 'm finding it a bit sad that you 're farming work out to mercenaries . - Charles . - Oh , um ... Combat zone protective security . That 's it , eh ? I 'm so sorry , David . Could you give us just a moment ? Yes , of course . I 'll see you in the conference . Five minutes , honestly . Robert Well , well , well . This is a step up from guarding oligarch brats , isn 't it , Mr Collins ? - Or is it Golding ? I 'm confused . - There 's no need to follow me around . - Make an appointment . - I tend not to make appointments . - It ruins the surprise . - What 's the surprise ? Barbara Haleton 's murder . See , I believe someones already been charged with that , haven 't they ? - How would you know that ? - Information is how I make my living . So the killing , that 's just a hobby , is it ? Why are you here , Harry ? I have proof that places you at the scene of Miss Haleton 's murder . - I 'm gonna bring you in for it . - Really ? Why haven 't you done it already ? Is it because you 're a rogue police officer with no remit on this and if you arrest me , your superior will almost certainly suspend you ? - Or have I got that wrong ? - It 's just a matter of time . Well , how much time ? You see , your brother 's already in Whitecross Prison and I believe that can be a very dangerous place indeed . I know who you are . I know what you really want . My brother has nothing to do with this . Leave him out of it . We should talk , but not here . Where , then ? After my meeting with the undersecretary , let 's meet at the Dome , just you and I. Say seven tonight at the Dome ? It 's a date . What 's this ? Something I should have given you a while ago . It 's about Harry . WINTER : So Harry wins two maximums in a row at Lau 's casino . SURI : Yes . What are the odds on that ? 1,225 to one . - WINTER : So it 's fixed . - He says it wasn 't . And all this on the night Lau died . Harry was there . ( SIGHS ) What are you gonna do , sir ? Nothing yet , but it does prove what I 've suspected all along . Harry 's connected to Lau 's criminal network . I mean , this is clearly some son of payoff . But if we are going to arrest Harry , we 're gonna need something more concrete . Something that shows how deep Harry goes into all this . LILY-ANNE : I know what Kaleem looks like . - Him ? - That 's right . Why ? Loose lips sink ships . And Kaleem 's lips are very loose indeed . But ... Do you like him ? Huh ! I 'm afraid there 's not much room in our business for sentiment , Lily-Anne . Kaleem has to go , and we need you to prove your loyalty by taking care of this yourself . You wanted a seat at the big boys ' table and we made that happen . I 'll say this much for your father , God rest his soul . He had balls . The future 's arrived , Lily-Anne . Either you 're a pan of it or you 're not . Sir , London is under siege and I know who 's behind it . A man called Golding . And who 's he ? It 's a pseudonym used by Charles Collins . He 's an ex-soldier , ex-spook , and he is now running London as the ultimate black op . Why are you telling me this now ? Because Collins , Golding , whatever you wanna call him , framed my brother for murder . - And why would he do that ? - Because he knows I 'm after him . And he wanted leverage over me . No , I don 't follow . Anything could happen to Rich inside Whitecross , the same as it did to Kevin Grey , and I 'm not there to protect him . Ah , so you 're here to ask me to get your brother released . My brother is innocent . I am here to ask you for a little time so I can put a case together against Collins . Your brother 's already been charged . If I 'm gonna ... lam telling you , this man is responsible for everything that is going wrong in our city and we can take him down , together . He wants me to meet him later . Cover me with a surveillance team . Listen to our conversations with parabolics . I can get him to talk . I can 't be involved in this . Why ? Because of Frierson ? Sir , Frierson is connected . He 's on the board of Collins 's company . They 're not even hiding it . Karl Frierson is pressurizing you to stop a crime wave that he 's involved in . This is an impossible situation , Harry . If you want your brother to be released , then I need evidence , and that evidence cannot come from you . Right . Right . So help me convince Suri . She can find it . She just needs pointing in the right direction . I don 't rate your chances of convincing DS Chohan to do anything . However , despite all that , I 'm gonna discreetly look into Charles Collins . Thank you . Thank you . But I don 't think you 're gonna be around long enough to see it through . Eve , I know who Golding is . I 'm going to meet him at the Dome . ( PHONE RINGS ) - Hello ? - RICH : Harry ? Rich ? I 've been told to tell you that there 's a change of plans . What ? Collins will meet you on the other side of the river . Where ? Royal Docks . You can take the cable car . - OK . Don 't worry . - Don 't do it . Rich , I 'm OK . Rich ? Rich ? ( PHONE RINGS ) - Eve . - I got your message . Yeah , change of plan . I 'm going to Royal Docks . And you 're just gonna meet him ? This is what he wants . He 's going to try and kill you . - I have no choice . - You 're walking right into his trap . He 's got my brother . You can 't count on the bracelet to protect you . It doesn 't work like that . Fish in a barrel . Eve . Eve . No . Come on . Move . Hey . Oi , oi , oi ! Hey , get down , get down , get down ! ( GROANS ) ( RINGING TONE ) MAN : Hello ? - Mr Linton ? - Yes . It 's Detective Superintendent Winter . What can I do for you ? I 'm emailing you a photo I 'd like Dr Marghai to look at . I can arrange that . May I ask why ? I 'd like to know if he can identify this man as the person who forced him to operate on Luke Bangura . Get the murder charge down to manslaughter ? I 'd be very happy to let the court know how much the police appreciate his ... cooperation and assistance . OK , send it over . - Will do . Goodbye . - OK , bye . Charlie ? What time is it ? - I 'm not gonna hurt you . - Where 's Charlie ? But you need to do exactly what I say . ( PHONE RINGS ) - Hello ? - Detective Superintendent Winter ? Speaking . I have some information about Detective Clayton you might find interesting . - Is that loaded ? - No . But this is . Proper little armory you 've got upstairs . - Where 's Freya ? - She 's fine . She 's just a bit tied up . Are those the overalls you wore when you killed Babs ? I bet they are . I bet those are her bloodstains . And I bet that somewhere in those fibers , along with plenty of your DNA , is the discharged gunpowder from when you put the pistol in my drugged brother 's wrong hand , put his finger round the trigger and pulled . Where 's Eve ? You can 't hurt her , you know . She 's the only person who can put the bracelet on you . - No . - No ? I 'm not who you think I am . I 'm merely a soldier following orders . Really ? - I 'm not Golding . - Who gave you the orders ? They were stupid . They should have known I 'd be protected . Pick up the bag . I 'm taking you in . There was a lad in my regiment . We called him Danger Dave . He was a mad little bastard from Derby , I think . The only guy we had in Sangin who could match the Afghans for sheer bloody guts . Rocket fire , bullets , couldn 't care less . He was too brave if anything . Time after time he 'd pop up , he 'd put his head where it shouldn 't be , and he always got away with it . That 's the thing about 19-year-olds , though , isn 't it ? I mean , they think they 're immortal . And then , one day , when things got really nasty , he got his head blown off . Just like that . So , for me ... " personally , the way I see it , I don 't care what kind of jewelry you 've got . Everyone 's luck runs out in the end . Right . I just got off the phone with a magistrate . Based on what you gave me earlier and an anonymous tipoff I 've received , we 've got a ticket to search Harry 's flat . You coming with us ? Of course . ( WHISPERS ) Alright . Police ! Nobody move ! Bedroom 's clear . Kitchen 's clear . Flat 's clear , sir . Alright , let 's start the search . What ? ! ( SIREN WAILS ) ( GASPS ) Sir .

 What if luck is something - you could own ? - What ? - Long night ? - No , no . I turned in early . I was whacked . - What 's Orwell got ? - A body dragged out the Thames . Young woman . Where 's Kevin Grey ? I 've no idea . Even though he was about to get on a private plane hired by you ? Is hiring a plane a crime ? No , but stuffing it full of cash is . It 's no secret that in this police force , there have been sins committed ... Just have to have a quick word with my brother . Did you manage to look into the ... the thing ? Your wee bracelet ? Test came back , inconclusive . Kayleigh was murdered as a message for Freddie Lau , Somehow Grey was ... manipulated into killing him . Kevin ... Kevin , don 't . Kevin , don 't ! - Grey ! Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck . Pleading guilty for both murders . Mr Grey ? - Who are you ? - Your solicitor . - We both can 't work on this case . - Well , then why don 't you go home ? Last night made me think ... I might love you a bit . And I think you love me a bit back . - Suri . - Harry ! It 's Ben ! Where is this ? It 's safe . I need one more week to persuade the other owner . No . You 've both just run out of time . Original air date : 2016 , February 5 Sync and subs by mielb Come on , Suri . That 's Ben 's mum . Harry , this is Ben 's mum , Maggie . I 'm so sorry about your son . He was a good man ... and a great officer . I knew when he came back that night that he wasn 't alright . That was the night he went out on that boat with you . - Yes . - Yeah . He told me all about it later . He said you could never have kept control of that boat , you were taking that bend in the river so fast ! Come on . This isn 't the way to MIA 's . I 'm taking you home . We 're on call in exactly 15 seconds . You 're not going to work . Yes , I am . I need to work . Suri , with all due respect , at this moment , you don 't know what you need . [ Phone ringing ] Don 't break the law ! - Hello ? - It 's Eve . You need to see me . No , I can 't . I 'll be at the corner of Gravel street and Hatton Garden . Change of plan . Where are we going now ? Hatton Garden . Why ? An informant of mines has some info on Lily-Ann Lau . I 'll be 10 minutes . Just round the corner . We have to go , now ! [ Dispatch calling over radio ] Hailing all units ! Viceroy diamonds court street , Hatton Garden , armed robbery . Believe one person seriously injured . Ambulance called . MIA 's 13 , unit 5 responding . ETA : one minute . Possible suspect in Viceroy armed robbery moving fast out Farrington road on motorbikes . - What 's going on ? - Robbery . Let 's go ! - It 's the diamond shop on the next street . - What ? It 's a miracle we were round the corner ! Yeah ... Jesus ! Hey ! Hello ? Suri , help me out here . Mate , you 're alright ? Suri ! There 's no blood . No gunshot wounds , no stab wounds to his body . There 's no obvious sign of blunt force trauma to his head ... Then , how did he die ? It 's difficult to tell until we got a full autopsy . The safe is open . There 's nothing left inside it . Right , so they emptied the safe , took all this stuff , and that , smashed the cabinets but left most of their contents ... Maybe they just came for what was inside the safe ... and then grabbed that stuff on their way out ? Any sign of a struggle ? The only odd thing I note is to his ends . His nails , they 're all , hmm ... OK ... - Time to go home . - I 'm fine ! - Come on . [ Clayton : ] Excuse me please . Suri ? Go home . I 'll see you at the office . [ Man praying in Hebrew ] Excuse me . Sorry . D.I. Clayton . Did you know the deceased ? He was my second cousin . His name was Gabriel Franks . And did you see what happened ? I was in a meeting . Someone just told me about it . Sorry . I 'm a little shaken . I have to go . No , sorry . Excuse me ! Can I talk to you , please ? I 'm afraid I have some more questions . I can meet you here tonight . Leave your details at the desk . My card . I 'll be back here at 7 : 30 . Kevin ? I 'd like to talk to you again about Kayleigh Fenchurch . Police only have your confession . Their whole case is nonexistent without it ! I think there 's something you 're not telling me about all this . Talk to me . I can help you ! No-one can help me . Not now . What do you mean ? As with the best MIA 's officers , Ben was driven by the pursuit of justice over and above any concern he had for his own person or safety . It is of course a great loss to his family and all of us here , at MIA 's . Am I right to say , sir , that this is the fourth murder we 've had within the last two weeks ? Kayleigh Fenchurch , Freddie Lau , Ben Grady , and the Hatton Garden jeweller - found murdered this morning ... - All these cases are being processed by our team ! We now have Kevin Grey who 's confessed to both the murders of Kayleigh Fenchurch and Freddie Lau in our custody . Where 's the headmaster ? I 'd thought that today of all days , you 'd ... put a lid on it . Wait a second ! We 've all heard ... We 've all heard that Freddie Lau was linked to everybody from the triads to ... Albanian drug smugglers . Where does Grey fit in ? This is an on-going investigation . I 'm afraid that 's all I can give you for the moment . - One more question ! - Thank you . [ All the journalists keep asking questions ] Ben Grady ... First MIA 's officer lost in action in ten years ! Only thing we got to abate this ... disaster ... is that we have Kevin Grey in custody and he 's confessed to the murders of both Fenchurch and Freddie Lau . We 're now building a strong case against him . He didn 't kill Kayleigh Fenchurch . D.S. Chohan , I know about your personal attachment to D.S. Grady and all I can say is how very very sorry I am for your loss . Thank you . I heard what happened this morning at the crime scene , in Hatton Garden , and it 's clear to me you need to take some leave . No ! I 'm fine ! This is non-negotiable . You 'll take some days off . Starting right now . We 've been here before , haven 't we , Harry ? This is nothing like ... Rotherhithe ? Really ? An immensely fraud situation full of incalculable risks , of volatile and dangerous suspect , and a reckless gamble on your part taking fellow officers right into the line of fire ! - OK . I get the picture . - If it was up to me ... - We were both there , remember ? - this would be it for you ... Right here ! Right now ! You 're a liability ! But ... I have protocol to follow . There 'll be an inquiry , evidence to consider , but while that 's going on , I can 't trust you to be out there , alone . D.I. Orwell 's going to be joining you on the Hatton Garden case . You both lost your D.S. ' s so you 'll be working as a team for now with D.I. Orwell at the reins . What ? Or you can take some voluntary leave until the inquiry 's over . It 's completely up to you . So ... before I do this , I 'm gonna need some kind of guaranty that you 're not completely insane . Rich , I think that this bracelet 's controlling my life . The woman that put it on me ... The woman you shagged from the casino ? Can we forget that a bit ? Nope ! The woman that put it on me said it 's yin and yang . Good and bad . For every bit of good luck I have , there 's a price to pay . And somehow , your twisted mind has come to conclusion that this personal ban is a yin to your yang . I think he died instead of me . So no guaranty , then ! You are insane . Just get the bloody thing off me , will you ? You 're sure you know what to do ? Yeah , yeah . I watched an all-night tutorial while you were at the loo ! What ? Hold on . Oh dear god ! Come on ! Ahhh ! Don 't take his hand off ! You two are proper idiots ! Have you got an explanation for what just happened ? None . But can we never do that again ? I 'll get these pictures and see what I find out for you . Thanks . Totally , man . Here , who works at the metropole for the diamond board ? Huh ... Intensely secretive bunch of diamond traders . No outsiders . I mean , what goes on there ? It 's for the real diamond traders . All the big diamonds of the world go through . Why ? Someone died at a diamond shop during the lope . Motorcycle gang , robbery gone wrong . I 'm meant to be investigating ... How about that ? That 's the second chop you knocked over in three days ! Second ? Head of security ? D.I. Clayton . Oh ! Liev , Solomons . Your colleague 's here already . ... it all was sort of ... Harry ! Good of you to join us . Mr Solomons , here , was just describing the attackers that came into his store the other day . Please , carry on . Well , they ... they all wore motorbike ... helmets ... with black visors ... You ... couldn 't see their faces ... It all happened so quickly . Not all they took was a few diamond rings from the counter here ... but from the safe ... But the more expensive stuff ... No ! Sir , I 'm a little bit confused here . - Did you do what they asked ? - Yes . Of course , I did . So why did they beat you up so badly ? They were violent men , pumped up ... One of them just kept at punching me ! It 's lucky I came back when I did . They would have finished him off ! But even then , they managed to escape , and then they ... did the same to your poor Franks . How well did you know Gabriel Franks ? Well . We 're a very close community . We 've all known each other for years . So , you weren 't friends ? Well , we were friendly to each other . OK . I think we 've got everything we need for now . - Do we ? - Yes . We 'll be in touch if anything else comes up . Hey . You think Solomons is lying to us , don 't you ? What ? You 're the only detective at MIA 's worth his salt ? So arrogant ! No-one 's beaten up that bad unless they 've done something wrong . Not when there 's so little time . Maybe he just pissed them off . Yeah , maybe these guys have a different agenda . We 'll know more when we check the CCTV at MIA 's , yeah ? Yeah , listen , I 'll meet you back there , I 'm gonna take another look at Frank 's shop ... Before setting the diamonds , they would have been cut . I looked around at Gabriel Frank 's shop , I got the impression he wasn 't doing too well . Gabriel was in serious debt . Who was he borrowing of ? On his debts ? I think they were fewer and fewer options open to him . Do you think he still owned anything ... valuable enough that someone might kill him for it ? Not anymore . Can you tell me what this is ? It looks like a Golconda Blue , but it 's impossible for me to tell whether it is real or not . What 's a Golconda Blue ? One of the rarest diamonds in the world . I found this photograph in Frank 's shop ... Is it possible that he had possessed an item such as this ? Ha ! No one in the whole board has ever had a diamond like that ! [ Elevator PA voice : ] Doors closing . Thirteen floor . Doors opening . I 'm not very good at grieving . Who is ? What you do ? Nothing . Which must be a complete nightmare for a maniac like you . But who will take my place ? I think it 's me that 's taking your place . What do you mean ? No way ! When did he make you SIU on this ? Why ? They want me to know where I stand . Which is ? On quick sand . He has it in for you . An officer died while working with me . Winter 's not going to let that go . Were you really driving the boat too fast ? Too fast to keep control ? I don 't know , Suri . Maybe . Maybe Ben was just unlucky . I need to talk to you . Chic minimal , I like to call it . So ... I need some advice ... From D.I. Clayton . - About Kevin Grey ? - Yes . You are aware there 's a conflict of interest in here ? Or MIA 's already started preparing our case against him , double murder ? You don 't think he killed Kayleigh Fenchurch , do you ? I 'm no longer on this case because you 're on this case . Harry ! I think he loved her . I 've no idea why he 's confessing when ... When the police have no physical evidence or witnesses . Exactly . Yes . Exactly . He 's scared , Harry . I don 't know how , but whatever deal he struck , out there , about confessing to all this , it 's not working out for him . What you 're gonna do ? Represent him the best way I can . Oh , Jesus ! Look , I 'm not happy with you being involved in this one . I know ! But I 'm a big girl , Harry . Right , bye then ! Get some furniture ! Right ! Enough is enough ! How do I get this off ? You can 't . It 's ridiculous ! You 've tried , haven 't you ? You knew , didn 't you ? About the diamond shop robbery this morning ? That 's why you sent me to Hatton Garden . I wanted you to understand these things are not happening in isolation . What does that mean ? That there 's someone out there who has a vested interest in all of this . They are running it . Oh stop it ! What about you , hey ? Why are you involved in this ? Cause ... this person killed my mother . And I want to see him stopped . It 's why I gave you the bracelet . But you don 't know me ! I do ! And you know me . No . Wait , wait , wait ! You said that luck like this has ... its own unique price . Yin and yang . What is that price ? The good luck that it brings me , what does that cost others ? [ Phone ringing ] Rich , I 'll call you back . Hey ! Wait ! These people will kill us , Harry ! What ? - Be careful . - What people ? Why are we meeting here ? It 's closed . I found an expert . She was very excited with those pictures I sent her . Hi . We 're outside . I have something very interesting to show you , detective Clayton . Take a look at these . Tang dynasty prosperity coins . Hmm . I see you 've noticed the symbols , yin-yang variants , just like yours , except yours has an extra yang line ! All these coins are used in Chinese mysticism to foretell your fate . But the extra yang line in your bracelet ... disrupts the main yin . There is a ... legend ... about a bracelet like yours . I heard it long ago . Great ! Yang Pre Fae was a noble and Sichuan woman and the story goes that one day , her uncle gave her a bracelet that he bought cheaply because it was forged in error . With an extra line ? Soon after she caught the eyes of the emperor , and became his consort . She soon welded enormous influence over the emperor , ultimately controlled his throne . Fearing ruin , the emperor was forced by his own soldiers to execute her ! Her bracelet disappeared ! What do you think ? I have no idea how to process that ! No , no , no . I mean her . Sexy , right ? What ? Look , it 's only a story . Yeah . He went missing for the second half of the day . He 's supposed to be investigating the case with you . Yeah , he appears to be , but I don 't know what he 's doing . I think that 's how he 's gonna play . This is the only Golconda diamond unaccounted for . The Blue Eye . French guy called Tavernier stole it from the eye of a statue of the goddess Khali in an Indian temple , back in the 1600 's . What , then nothing ? I 've checked every auction record , every large gem stone transfer since . Right . Must have been the Franks business . This is your case . Do not let Clayton take the initiative . I want the whole unit to see him working for you . That 's why you 're SIO . OK . Yeah , you should get it now . Yeah , this is coming up . So , Gabriel Franks ... Hatton Garden ... Ah ! See ! Guarantor : Max Solomons ! How did you work that out ? Just a hunch ! What are you doing ? Solving your case ! How 's your boyfriend ? Er , boss ? That 's funny . Our guys got something for us . I have a MOT and robbery squad who 's been tracking the motorcycle gang in West 11 . They 're knocking down security bands , stray bikers , target similar descriptions . Why did they change the diamonds ? Because the security bands are now being tracked by robbery squad . Now see , it 's a smart move . Anyway , it 's what we 're doing after this . And you got to liaise with them . Aye-aye , skipper ! Franks died of a massive heart attack which given the state he was in , large fatigue liver , his obvious alcohol dependency , could have come at any time . You think the stress of the robbery just naturally broke his arm for Franks ? Who 's the S.I.O on this ? I am . Natural is not a word I 'd use for his death , no . Look under his fingernails . There 's areas of haemorrhage and soft tissue damage , consistent with sharp objects , needles , and force stab with them . He was tortured ? Till he died . What are these ? Melanin pigmentation . Is that common ? It 's rare in Caucasians but it 's not unheard of . If he died when they were still torturing him , the gang didn 't get what they came for . What do you think that is ? A very big , very rare ... diamond . I found this taped under Franks ' desk . Look at the nail . The same melanin pigmentation . It doesn 't prove Franks had this . We just found out that Solomons ' name was on the deeds to Franks ' shop . They went to school together . That means he lied to us about Franks . Think about it . Solomons ' left hand was bandaged as well . So what else was he lying about ? OK . OK . I 'll go to West 11 robbery squad , you go back and lean on Solomons . Good decision , chief . This is your forte , isn 't it , Harry ? What 's that ? Getting in the heads , people like Franks ? Weak men , broken by vices they can 't control . Yes . So , Mr Solomons , I 've been reading up about the Golconda Diamonds . You 're aware of them , yeah ? Yes ! Of course . Yeah , and somewhere I read that these diamonds are so rare that each one of them has a ... unique clarity ! Oh , I don 't know . Maybe ! So owning one of these would be like owning ... God ... I don 't know ... a Picasso , say ! I mean especially if the Picasso was stolen ... Which would mean you wouldn 't be able to sell it . Well , legally ... anyway . I don 't understand . The last legally sold Golconda diamond was the Graff Blue . That went in 2008 for 16.4 million . That was only 31 carats . What would you say a diamond double the size would fetch now ? 50 million ? Nearly ? I 've got no idea ! Why are you asking me these questions ? Then , you know , maybe it 's not all about the money . Owning something as rare as that , that 's more about power , isn 't it ? I don 't know ! Oh , Mr Solomons , I think you do . Is there any reason why you lied to me about how well you knew Gabriel Franks ? Do you remember how many Solomons own his diamond business ? Your name was on the deeds to the shop ! You investigated my father , detective . Do we need a lawyer ... present ? Is it because ... he offered you a stake in this ? How long before they have a second go at you ? Now that they know that Franks didn 't have the Blue Eye ? Unless you 're going to arrest me , please , leave my shop ! Next time , they 'll kill him . No diamond 's worth dying for . [ Recorded message on Harry 's phone ] Harry , it 's Suri . I can 't sit around any longer . I 'm going to the Green Dragon tavern to have a look around . Double . No-one twists on 18 . What 's the maximum bet on that table ? There is no maximum . Excuse me , how much longer is he gonna be ? My time scheduled with him started 15 minutes ago . I 'll call the wing . See what the hold-up is . Shit ! Back ! Move it ! Move back ! Police ! Move back . Police ! Come on , come on ! [ Moaning ] Max ? Max ? This is D.I. Clayton . I need an ambulance . I 'm in a passage in Hatton Garden . Victim has stab wounds to the stomach . Also requesting case back-up on motorcycle fleeing the scene ! Best to leave it on . Max ? Kevin Grey died after 48 hours in your custody . Apparently , he sliced his own throat using a razor blade . Can you explain to me how this was allowed to happen ? No . But this is my prison . Grey was my prisoner . I realize I 'm fully responsible . Well , that 's all very noble of you , governor , but it doesn 't help me ! Why wasn 't Grey being closely monitored ? He hadn 't been flagged as suicide risk . But he wasn 't ! Until he came into your prison ! But whatever you subjected to in the few days he spent here , clearly you made him into one ! Grey was with us for only a few days . I 'm afraid that wasn 't enough time for me . You see , I believe passionately that we can change the men who come in here . I hear that 's something you believe too . Progressive rehabilitation . My client died in your prison . You 're not going to persuade me into thinking we 're suddenly allies . [ First lock opens ] [ Second lock opens ] OK . How could you possibly know that ? Lucky guess ! Bollocks ! Also , it 's the door numbers on the Solomons and Franks shops . Alright . Let 's have a look . Ah , well ! Guess even Harry Clayton can 't be right all the time , hey ? Wai-wai-wai-wait ! Come here ! Come here ! Come here ! Look ! That 's the diamond ! They were going to re-cut it . There 's Ackerman 's initials . No more bets . 23 red . Are you going to follow me around all night ? Why not ? You 're on a hot streak ! Good night , detective . I 'm off duty . Evidently . Are you OK ? You don 't look at all well . I 'm fine , thank you . In fact ... I 've been doing very well ... since I 've come to THIS table . Yes . Hope you enjoy your little Harry Clayton act . Of course , by this point , Harry has always always lost his shirt . Do you know why your boss is such a bad gambler ? Because he has a delusional understanding of risk . Even when it 's obvious to everyone around him that he should just fold , Harry Clayton still thinks he can beat the odds . Must make him a very dangerous man to work with ! Harry does just fine . Thank you . Oh ! I nearly forgot . Please , accept my condolences . I heard that one of your officers died . I 'm very sorry to hear that . We 're gonna make Kevin Grey talk . I think you 'll find that hard . You 've known about this diamond all along , haven 't you ? That 's why you protected Franks . That 's why you helped him stay a member of the board . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I think that Franks shredded his share of this diamond to a ruthless man . A man who would not want the diamond to be cut up like this . Max Solomons ' cutter , who is he ? - How would I know that ? - Because you 're a part of this . J.A.A. Joseph Aaron Ackerman , you ! We need a name , Joe . Even if I knew , I couldn 't tell outsiders like you . I would be ejected from the board , I 'd loose my business ! Well , this man is in extreme danger . You have no choice . Really ? Joe Ackerman , I 'm arresting you for perverting the course of justice . You don 't have to say anything , but it may harm your defence ... [ Phone ringing ] Anna ? Where are you ? He called me last night . He just asked if he could see me . Sounded as he was finally gonna tell me the truth . - And then he ... - I know . Anna ? Have you ever wondered why you were hired ? I don 't know what you mean . Well , do you think someone knew , the minute you came on this case , that I 'd be taken of it ? Think about it ! How did Grey hire your firm ? When I first questioned him , he didn 't even want a solicitor . Well , let 's face it , you guys aren 't cheap ! So ... He must have had some serious backer ! I don 't know who 's paying for this case . - That 's more Nathan 's realm . - Right . It 's OK . It 's gonna be OK . Ackerman 's in . Just heard Kevin Grey killed himself last night in White Cross . Probably couldn 't live with what he 'd done to that girl . - Or Lau . - Yeah . There 'll be no conviction , now . Case will show unsolved . Serve it on the cold case , sir . We will know who killed them both . By what Clayton says . If I can get that command to release the cartel 's name , at least we could still set up a sting on the motorcycle gang . You think they 'll still come back for the diamond ? It 's priceless . Worth the risk . Since whoever 's run , they 're one step ahead of us all along . One step ahead of Clayton . Two steps ahead of you ! While we wait for your lawyer , I thought we 'd have a chat on your international VAT status . ... HMRC 's done some checks on you . Can I come in ? OK . How 's he doing ? Oh , they wouldn 't know . Next 24 hours is crucial . But thank you . Gabriel Franks wanted to re-cut and get rid of the Blue Eye diamond . But your dad wouldn 't let him , correct ? No , my father , he loved it . It 'd enchanted him . He could never agree to have it broken up . Till Franks was killed . Then he knew . He had to re-cut it . Sell it on , somehow . Now , it 's too late . You need to give me the cutter . His life is in danger . - I already told them . - Told who ? The people who did that . They were here . An hour ago . Where 's the cutter ? Tell me ! Tell me ! Below Smithfield market . [ Phone ringing ] We need to talk . - I need to get to Smithfield . - It 's important . I went to the Green Dragon casino . I think they 're running a fixed roulette table . I watched two hard-rollers lose big on black-jack . Then they went to a specific roulette wheel , with listed numbers on their phone . A roulette table ? Most hosts spent their money on drinks . They 're going with dirty money , lose and leave with clean cash . This is Harry 's phone . Please , leave a message . I 've got Ackerman to talk . Are you sure ? It 's a roulette table that 's being rigged ? Yes ! One . I 've won money on one of these tables ! A lot of money ! [ Phone beeps ] I got to go . [ Phone beeps ] You have one new message . First new message : I 've got Ackerman to talk . The diamond 's in a vault under Smithfield market . I 'm on my way . Oh , Jesus , Orwell ! [ Siren activated ] Jesus ! Come on , get in ! Where is it ? - Where is it ? - Relax ! Relax ! Where 's the diamond ? Go to hell ! Bye bye ! Wait ! Who are you ? I know where the diamond is . I can get it for you . You have got 10 seconds or you both die . - 5 seconds ! - Wait ! [ Clock rings ] Come on , quick ! I have it ! I have it ! - Come on then ! - Wait ! Is this what you 're looking for ? Stop ! I said stop ! You 're gonna shoot me , Harry ?

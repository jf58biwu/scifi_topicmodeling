 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... A team centered around people with powers ? There exists a small percentage of the population with a dormant alien gene . There 's a chemical compound that activates this gene , and you , Joey , are one of the first people with this gene to come into contact with it . No leadership means nobody giving orders , and that sure as hell includes you . I 'm done flying solo . I miss having a team around me . I miss her , too . I 'm having a hard time accepting it ... all of it . I-I 'm on my third hand , May took off on vacation and never came back , So I lost my right hand , too . We need to say goodbye . Jemma would want us to do that . Do someth-I-I-I-ing ! May our gifts see you through the journey . Perhaps it w - What if I fail to return ? Be brave , my lord . Will he come back ? Our best minds ? Are working to understand this . But as far as we know , in all of history ... No one has ever returned . I think Joey 's a real candidate . Sure . He 's inhuman . But ... Doesn 't meet my criteria . He 's a decent guy , and you know it . Getting that unit up and running is priority . Yeah , but it doesn 't mean it has to be a rush job . Look , Dr. Garner will make his recommendation . And it will be the same as always - Three months observation and counseling before reassessment . He 's as much of a buzzkill as you are . And if you haven 't been keeping score , our team 's down to Three Musketeers . May and Simmons are gone . Fitz might as well be , Bobbi 's on the DL . And from what I hear , Hunter 's planning to leave . Yeah , but not for good . He 's got a score to settle . - It 's Fitz ! - Fitz broke into containment ! - Fitz ! ? - Fitz , get out of there ! Are you crazy ? Close it ! Close it ! I got it ! Damn it , Fitz . I had to know - had to - had to know - I already lost Simmons to that thing . I cannot afford to lose you , too . Trying to get yourself killed ? Sorry . I won 't give up . I can 't give up . None of us want to , Fitz , but ... Fitz , you tried . Okay ? You tried your hardest . Everybody knows that . No . I missed something . I m ... I missed something . What is that ? Proof . Sand . Not just sand - impossible sand . The monolith 's case is a clean room . There 's nothing in there but that rock . Not even dust . Unless you blast it open with a shotgun and contaminate everything . That 's not what this is . Okay , the sand itself - not unusual . Mostly silicone-dioxide particles just like on earth . But you 're saying this sand is not from earth ? Sir , carbon dating shows that - It predates the earth by a billion years . So you think the rock is a portal ? No . No , I 'm proving that it 's a portal , okay , to another planet , a-a very old planet - a crack in space-time that carried Simmons away ... and carried the sand back . Which means ... She 's out there . But it 's been months . Yeah ? She could be long gone from wherever this thing dropped her . - Yeah . - She could be dead ? Yes . But we 're gonna find out , aren 't we ? - Yeah . - You 're damn right . ? Yeah . Okay , Fitz , what do you need ? Uh , uh , well , uh , more historical data . People have studied this thing for centuries . I need an expert on quantum mechanics and einstein-rosen bridge theory , And a - a sandwich would be nice . I might have an idea - about the other things . You two , stay with our new inhuman guest . Be here ? For Dr. Garner 's assessment . Building that team is still the priority . - What did I say ? - Bobbi - I 'm on this with Fitz . Yeah , haven 't you been on this with Fitz the whole time ? Hiding his trip to Morocco , covering for him on a constant basis ? Have I ? And you know where you 're going . Coulson would be pissed if he knew what you had planned . Part of our agreement . He won 't sweat the details , and I won 't share them . You really think Ward 's back with Hydra ? Damn it . I want to go after him with you . You 're still on the mend . Plus , you 've been undercover with hydra , and that face makes an impression . The rest of you makes a bloody statement . You like me stuck here in the lab . Too bloody right . You 're missing half a lung because you took a bullet Ward intended for me . Nearly bled out in my arms . If you being in the lab means I never have to see something like that again , I 'm all for it . Bobbi , you want to fly ? - Desperately ? - Good . Here 's our destination . Who 's Professor Randolph ? This monolith has been studied for centuries . Well , Randolph 's actually been on the planet for those centuries , and he 's traveled through space in a portal and he 's also an alien . So he 's got a lot going for him . Don 't die out there . And , Hunter ... Make sure he does . Hell of a machine , Kebo . Built for precision , speed designed to handle flawlessly under any conditions . But Carmine here bought it as a status symbol to show off . Never opened it up , denied it of its true purpose . Old Hydra 's full of guys like him - Soft , entitled , mistaking wealth for success , privilege for power . Their greed splintered Hydra into a thousand pieces . Their time is over . Time for a leaner generation . These people have proven themselves in blood . Did you see how they didn 't even flinch ? Now 's your chance to prove you still have purpose . Show me you 're not dead weight . So , tell me Where 's the kid ? I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . Can 't or won 't ? - Potato , puh-tah-toe . - And your reason ? The nightly news , cities flying into the atmosphere , government task forces , and now the public is freaking out about alien outbreaks . Pretty crappy time to be on earth if you 're not a local , so I am staying low . And of course there is my current situation . Destruction of property , public drunkenness . Yes , well , Asgardians can generally hold their drink . It 's just , well , one night I tried to hold all the drinks . Asgardians are also strong , right ? You could easily break out . What ? And miss dinner ? Oh , no . Yes , Norse prisons are surprisingly evolved - Decent food , comfy bed , extensive library , and no attention being drawn to me . Come back in a few months , why don 't you ? Maybe then I 'll be in the mood . We don 't have a few months . And neither do you . I don 't have to remind you that I saved your life , though I did just mention it in case you forgot . But I 'd still have no problems contacting those task forces you mentioned . I bet they 'd go bonkers to have a real-life Asgardian to dissect in their labs . I don 't know how comfy you 'd be there . Why , Agent Coulson ... are you threatening me ? I wouldn 't call it a ... Well , yeah , I guess I am . That 's absolutely a threat . You 're different now . You know that ? One must accommodate the times or things get messy . What 's with the hand ? Things got messy . Well ... you 'll have to cover my release . And if there is a portal , which I will have to see to believe , you are diving into very dangerous waters here . All right . Well , it 's not like you 're giving me any choice . He did it . Good to see you , Dr. Garner . Hmm , enjoying the use of the private jet ? It 's very helpful . Thanks . Those jump seats aren 't made for transcontinental trips , I 'll tell you that . Are you hungry ? I can have something whipped up for you . That would be great . Thanks . Anything to drink ? Daisy , trying to butter me up ? What , are you not hungry ? Hey , look , my job is to keep everyone safe . Not just potential recruits , but you , as well . Bribery 's not gonna get this guy approved for the team any faster . Wouldn 't know , because you haven 't approved anyone yet . Well , here 's , uh , Joey Gutierrez . Yeah , I was reading his file on the flight - Liquefies metal . How 's he holding up ? Well , he 's terrified . That 's a healthy response . What about you two ? How are you guys doing ? No , no . Unh-unh-unh . You are not getting me on the couch today , doc , unless it 's a conversation between friends . That 's all I meant . Great . How 's May ? Where is she ? Is she ever coming back ? You should ask her yourself . Well ... I would if I knew where she was . No , no , no . You don 't watch where the ball goes . Then how would I find it ? You 're usually very good at things like this - a natural . Yeah , well , there 's nothing natural about this game , and your comments after every swing make it super fun . You 'll get hooked . You 'll see . All right , fair 's fair . 10 shots for me , 5 reps for you . That 's why we 're here . Work that hip . You don 't have to worry about my rehab , and that 's not why you 're here . I may not be a spy , but 20 years with your mother has taught me to pick up on things . You 're not here because you care about me . Oh , now I don 't care about you . I didn 't say that . I said that 's not why you 're here . Come on , Mellie . You - you take a trip to Honolulu with Andrew ... It was Maui . And you come back the daughter of the year . Something is not right . All right , I 'll figure it out for myself . Well , I hate to disappoint , but it looks like your regular , old - How often does it do that ? It 's random . No . No , no , no , no . It may seem random . But this ... Something is clearly triggering it . I 've checked it against tides , relation to the sun , rotation - On this planet . So you have no idea how to control it . Why come to me ? I 'm no interstellar-travel expert . I 've never even studied gravitational lensing or zero-point energy fields or quantum-harmonic oscillation theory . Yet you know all those words you just said . And you 're scared of portals . You 're scared of being dragged back home through a portal . So I think in your drunken stumble through history , you 've probably investigated every story involving one . And I 've seen you eyeing all of your exits , my knee brace , wondering if you can get away with it . The only reason you came with us was to confirm its existence . And destroy it . You 'll have to go through me . And I could . Literally . But , then , I don 't know what amazon woman and robot hand are capable of these days , so I will help you get her back . I 'm not entirely heartless . But if I do , I want your word that we will demolish this portal and no one passes through it again . - I 'll sleep better at night . - Good . Well , I 've investigated a lot of these wormhole rumors , but that 's all they were - rumors . None have panned out . So we know nothing of its origin . Kree maybe . And this parchment was found with it . Well , hello . I 've seen this . It 's a common Hebrew word . Yes . What else do we know , Mr. Fitz ? Uh , well , the monolith changed hands a lot - Germanic tribes , spent the Hundred Years ' War in France . But before the Napoleon era , it was moved again . - I lost track of it somewhere in ... England ? Yeah . How did you know that ? Because I have seen this word carved into the walls of a castle in Gloucestershire , England , in 1853 . To the plane ! Am I allowed to say that ? Let 's all go to the plane , I guess What 's the point of a boat if you never take it out of the dock ? Like camping in a living room . There . There are easier ways of getting money than kidnapping . Mr. Braun needs to see the world for what it really is . He can open many doors for us . Sorry , girls . Not allowed to post , but happy to take some of you . That 's great . What 's going on down there ? Private party . Okay . I 'm on the list . Down below ! Good thing I dropped by . Why 's that ? I 'm an exterminator . Yes . Yes , yes . I came here for a costume ball - That was the pretext , of course - I heard rumors of travel to the stars . Found it all to be nonsense . But it was a fun party . The carvings ? Oh , right , right . Of course . So I was here admiring the stone work , and ... The same as the scroll - " Death . " Maveth " Maveth . " Yeah , one of its translations is actually " Death by punishment . " Could mean " No trespassing . " A Hebrew warning carved in an English castle struck me as odd . Out of place . Seems ancient . But you stopped looking into it ? A man dressed as an owl , of all things - I got him drunk enough to admit that no travel to other worlds was even occurring . Just ritualistic killings . Eh , the whole thing stunk of half-baked satanism - Just some fabrications to entice new members . And , well , there were fire dancers . I got distracted . Here 's another one . This is why I got rid of all the S.H.I.E.L.D. logos on our vehicles . It 's like screaming for attention . You know , there 's a ginormous eagle symbol on top of our jet . Yeah , sometimes I can 't help myself with the cool . You certain about this ? It does say " Death by punishment . " After you . Let me guess . Joey Gutierrez is unfit for action . Physically , psychologically , and emotionally . The man can 't open a doorknob without melting it . My psych-101 students could tell you he 's not ready . Maybe , in time . We are running out of time . Things keep coming at us . It 's like punching a waterfall . New inhumans , the atcu , and this - this new guy . You should have seen him . It was a whole new level . You want to fight fire with fire . I get it . But you can 't be reckless about it . All these people who transform have the potential to turn into monsters . But the team you do have has that danger , as well . Sounds like there 's some sage advice coming . Everywhere you turn , fires are burning . Coulson 's desperate to win on any front . But desperation leads to mistakes . Giving Hunter carte blanche to get payback , letting Fitz try to open a portal to save one life - these are questionable decisions . You should be telling him that . He doesn 't want to hear it right now . He 's ... he is who he is . But you ... you 're still changing . You see something I don 't ? Horns ? You 're turning into a leader , and I 'm concerned about how you 're handling the adjustment . I totally just gave you permission to analyze me , didn 't I ? You are on a couch . Look , you are laser-focused on finding members for this team . I understand the need for these secret warriors . No , it 's more than that . When I changed , I felt like a monster . I needed help . This is a chance to show people they have a place to belong . It sounds stupid . No , but what you 're describing sounds more like a halfway house . I 'll gladly help you build that . My mother created a halfway house for inhumans , and it was not enough . I ... I want inhumans taking action with S.H.I.E.L.D. To see that being different can mean making a difference . You chop like your mother . I think she chopped her vegetables like that as a warning to me . " Stay in line , old man . " You left the kitchen window open again . Paranoid ... a quality you share with your mother . You see her much ? Mm , she calls me now and then to see if I 'm still living . You haven 't called anybody yourself . Are you in hiding ? Come on over . I want to show you something . I found it while I was downsizing . God . You put on skates at 7 years old , and you didn 't take them off until five years later . A natural . I was obsessed with Dorothy Hamill . I remember that well . Mostly I remember how hard the ice was when I 'd fall ... Over and over . That 's why I switched to martial arts ... padded floors . Well , and you could hit people . You expecting company ? No , but I 'm not afraid of the prospect . What the hell are you doing here ? Neighborhood watch . Okay , well , this room wasn 't on the last tour . It 's an odd shape for architecture this period . Definitely built after I was here . Reminds me of the bunker under the Louvre . What ? There 's no bunker under the Louvre . That 's a joke , right ? You 're messing with me . All right , great . Now I 'll have to check . It 's late 1800s . Still got some life to it . I hear water . Could be a stream underground , maybe hydroelectric power . This looks a lot like it was made to hold ... The monolith . This machine was designed to control the portal , to open and close it at will . Do you know that , or is that just what you hope it to be ? Well , there 's only one way to find out . Mack , I need you to load something onto Zephyr One and bring it to us . What exactly am I bringing , sir ? Yeah ... You 're not gonna like it . You never earned a single thing in your life . You 're a waste of your family money . So ... We 're taking everything . Starting with banking passwords . Go screw your ... I 'm not asking . From here on out , you want something , you earn it . Teeth , eyes , fingers ... whatever it takes . Get the passwords . A lot of speculation back at HQ as to why you went AWOL . Spiritual walkabout , midlife crisis ... Early midlife crisis . I know you didn 't elope with your ex , 'cause he 's actually been around . Hawaiian islands couldn 't rekindle that old flame , eh ? You heard about Simmons ? Coulson and I spoke on the phone . I know . He traced it . Pay phone at L.A.X ... . one of the surviving few . How did you find me ? Been reaching out to some of my less savory associates , trying to dig up anything I can on Hydra . My mate in Leavenworth said they 'd received an anonymous call from a woman asking the same questions . Pay phone again . Careless . You do know that only .3 of the population of Sun City are Asian ? What do you want ? Your skills . I plan to put Ward six feet underground at the least . Your help would be appreciated . I 'm out . My father needs me . Oh , yeah . Car accident . Broke his hip . Police called it a hit-and-run . Looks like Mr. May 's doing okay to me . He 's getting there . But they never found the driver . It was an accident , and I 'm here to help him get back on his feet . Yeah ? Is that why you nearly decapitated me for dropping by ? Why you 're making anonymous calls to old C.I.s ? Part of you wonders if it was Ward going after the people you care about . We both know he 's capable of it . And unless I 'm off the mark , he 's out there , pumping new life into Hydra . And we both know where they 'll come knocking first . - What 's your way in ? - From below . Climb the ranks . Hail Hydra and all that . He sees your face , you 're made . If he 's close enough to see my face , then I 'm close enough to put a bullet in his . I 'm out . I 'm gonna nab a payload from these gunrunners to establish my cover . If you change your mind . Whatever your reason , you can never be truly out if you 're always looking over your shoulder . And next time , it won 't be me outside the window . Zephyr One , you 're clear to retract . Room full of ancient gack . Kind of reminds me of your office , director . Realistically , what are the odds of this thing working ? If we were realistic , we never would have gotten this far . Well , Andrew Garner thinks I need to be more so . He recommended three months observation and counseling before reassessment for Joey . Says I 'm reckless . Don 't take it personally . - He probably just meant that ... - He said you 're desperate . What ? He didn 't say that . Did he say that ? Let me guess . I 'm struggling to come to terms with physical limitations and losing my sense of self instead of redefining it . No , he didn 't mention you . Oh , he did . That 's what he said . - Oh , good . - Yeah . Mack ... Mack , push that lever . No , the one ... the one that 's ... the one that 's down . The one ... the one beside it . Push it . Everybody , stay clear ! Fitz , it 's working . It 's staying open . Light ! I need more light ! We got a problem ! I need some bloody light ! Fitz ! The gears have locked ! Bobbi ! Skye ? Skye , are you okay ? S-Skye ? It 's Daisy . What ? It 's Daisy now , sir ? You 're really having a hard time with this , huh ? Damn it . Yeah . Daisy , hey . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . I 'm better . That pulsing sound was killing me . What pulsing sound ? Are you serious ? It was deafening . Slow down . Slow down . Slow down . It holds the portal open . That flare shot straight through . If we could send a hard-wired probe through , we can see the other side . We can find her . - We 'll fix the machine , turbo ... - We have to fix it . ... But you got to chi ... How are we supposed to fix a machine we don 't know how it works ? I figured you for a mama 's boy . One slap , and you spit out the info . It 's been a good run , kid . Now , let 's just get to the end . Come on . Okay . You win . Nobody treats me like that and lives . Do you even know who the hell I am ? Do you ? ! You 're Werner Von Strucker . Your father was Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker , one of Hydra 's greatest leaders . Powerful family name doesn 't mean you deserve respect . You earn that . I wondered if you had it in you . Your old man would be proud . Come on . Brought tacos . Unfinished business ? Is that what you 're in hiding from ? You and your mother . Silence always means yes . You take after her in that way . In every way . So that 's what this visit is all about ? Things with you and Andrew did not work out so well , so you feel damaged in some way . But there are worse things to be than your mother 's daughter . I just want to have a normal life , dad , away from S.H.I.E.L.D. I want to see if I can . Normal ? With a handgun in your golf bag ? Trying to protect me from some unfinished business that follows you like a shadow ? You remember the pain when you hit the ice , but I always remember how quickly you would get up . I was a kid . It didn 't hurt as much then . My daughter always got back up . You needed a push . I had to know you could handle the fall . I should have you killed . Okay . First thing , if you 're gonna kill someone , Don 't threaten them . Just do it . Oh , my father would have you ... Your father kept you in the dark and then died a meaningless death , leaving you to hide your face with no answers . I know what it 's like to come from a complicated family . Hydra 's fractured , in pieces . We 're gonna rebuild it ... the right way ... By force . My father so rarely let me see any of his world . It 's your world now . And when we put these pieces back together , they 'll be stronger than the original . It 'll just rattle apart again . We have to reinforce the connections . Reinf ... look , most of the workings are under the ground . We just can 't tear the castle down . And actually , we 're lucky the room is shaped this way , or the machine might have shaken it apart on top of us . Wait . Wait . Yeah , yeah , yeah . That 's the point . Quantum harmonic oscillation theory , like the professor said . I know that look . It 's a strange shape for this time period Because it 's made to resonate , uh , to ... to ... to ... uh ... Create a-a quantized field within the stone . Fitz , you 're talking , but we 're not totally following . The room is a speaker . The machine is an amplifier . A sub ... subsonic frequency to resonate with the monolith . You saying you figured out a way to fix the machine ? No . I 'm saying I figured out that ... We don 't have to . I can do it . I can open the portal myself . Well . Turns out we 're standing in the middle of the world 's largest subwoofer . Yeah . If the point of the machine was to resonate the room at a certain frequency , I can do that . And you can replicate it ? Kind of drilled into my brain . And it could kill you . How long do you think you can hold it ? Maybe a minute . If it 's too much , you pull back . I can 't lose you , too . I got this . Here we go . Camera and data sensors are hard-lined back to us through a cable ... no signal loss that way . If Daisy can hold it , we 'll get a visual of the other side . That 's what we 're looking for . All right , you listen to me . You take care of yourself . We lose that probe , nobody cares . Uh , I 'm confused . What exactly is she planning to do here ? Sorry . Still tuning . Hold it open as long as you can . Fitz , no ! Jemma ! Jemma ! Jemma ! Jemma ! Fitz ! Fitz ! Jemma ? ! Jemma ? ! Jemma ! Fitz ! Damn it . Pull him back . Get him back here . I can 't hold it ! You did good , tremors . You did good . Fitz . No sign of radiation or infection . Fitz would never have found her , but she saw the flare . We brought a woman ? back from the dead today . And , happily , you kept up your end of the bargain . The portal is destroyed . - Thank Daisy for that . - Yeah . Agent Coulson ... What exactly is Daisy ? They call themselves inhumans . I have not heard that word in a very long time . Yes ? Your team ? pulled off a miracle today . Fitz got Simmons back . I thought you deserved to know . They think she 's gonna be okay if you want to come back and see her . Or stay . I think headquarters is big enough for the two of us . I 'm glad she 's safe . Simmons is back . She 's okay . Are you serious ? She 's alive ? Fitz , you absolute beauty ! Come on , beers ? ! Let 's get a beer ! Come on , May , smile for once in your life . We 'll return in a moment . First thing tomorrow morning , all right ? - Dr. Garner ? - Yeah . Yeah ? I 'm sorry for the intrusion , but I was hoping to add your class . You okay with a few weeks ' makeup work ? Yeah , I-I just transferred . I think psychology might be my major . Okay . You know why most people take psych , right ? Damn this pen . Here . Give me your back . They 're trying to figure out their families . You got me there . You wouldn 't believe how messed up mine is .

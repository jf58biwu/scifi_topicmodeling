 I got nothing . Just rocks . Some sand and more fucking rocks . Thank you , Sergeant Hunter , AKA Captain Obvious , for the most impressive Sit-Rep . I 'd completely failed to notice the extensive rock population , myself . An outcropping to the right . You see what I 'm seeing ? Holy shit . Up 200 meters . Well , well , well , the boy came out to play after all . Are we compromised ? Negative . The fuck are they doing down there ? Shit . Ease up . Keep eyes on . He 's on the move . Can you get a head shot from here ? We need to take this fucker out and avoid hitting the kid . I don 't have a clear shot . He 's got a kid with a bomb , that could sneak into any market place , from here to Kandahar . Take the shot . You wanted the pink mist , it 's yours . Take the shot . Control your breathing . Take the shot . We there yet ? This doesn 't look like the ocean . There 's too many trees . Just hang on , we 're making good time . Is this really you guys ? Yep , semper fi . Yeah , okay , seriously though . Do you understand how many likes you could get on footage like this ? Hear that , James ? My girl thinks we 're heroes . Baghdraneva ... I love the way it rolls off the tongue . Just please don 't call him that . Those beads don 't make him Hindu . They just make him more likely to make out with men at raves . Hey , hey , keep your panties on , both of you . Who 's wearing panties ? I am . Lost in your phone again . I 'm just checking some work emails . Babe , you work at a drive-through espresso stand in your bikini all day . How many important work emails do you get ? I 'm the manager , Baby . Tons . Come on , baby , seriously . Put the phone away . I 'm just checking some things . Oh , babe , come on . Not the Twilight tours again . Tim thinks that I look just like the chick from the movie . I 'm not doing a Twilight tour . You know , actually , did anybody ever tell you that you look kind of like that Jacob ... Oh , yes , I was just thinking that , yes ! Totally . The native werewolf guy . It 's because of the jaw line . The jaw , the nose too though . Enough . I go away for a couple tours and I come back , and not only did he change his name to Moon Nectar of the fucking gods , or whatever the shit he calls himself . Now you got him watching tween flicks as well ? What happened to you , man ? It 's called an awakening , Jimbo . The whole planet 's waking up . Yeah ? Waking up to what ? A fucking dick in their mouth ? Courtesy of the power-elite ? Jesus fucking Christ ! Man , the shit you say is just wrong . However , there is one stop that we do need to make . Another pit stop ? Dude , this is horse 's shit , man . It 's gonna be too damned late to even surf , by the time we get to La Push . Whatever . Can we get some Cheetos ? You used to be fat . You remember that right ? You guys are faggots . Shut the fuck up . So , this is where your meth guy lives ? No , brother , it 's not meth we 're here for . Believe it or not , in that white-trash Mecca , is the key to the sweet-leaf holy grail . God , you 're so random . Yeah , and speaking of random , you know that I get surprise UA 's pretty much all the time . No way I 'm smoking up with you fucking assholes . Dude , this ganja is some next level shit . It 's not worth the risk , okay ? You 're out of the Corps now , it 's different for you . Those pills you 're taking , are not the answer . Cannabis has medicinal properties , alright ? It 's not just some recreational time-waster . Science has my back on this . Yeah , science , bitch . Look , this is a once in a lifetime opportunity . You go in there , you get a map that leads you to a secret grove in the mountains . It 'll be a badass mission , just like before ! I 'm not going in . Dude , this ganja is out of this world . It is not of this earth ! Comprende ? Dude , hand me the box , let 's go . Thank you . Oh , my god . Sweet-leaf holy grail , huh ? Yeah , told you , come on . Yeah , this is the right place . Namaste . I 'm looking for Seth Guardrail Slaughter , is he in ? - Seth Guardrail Slaughter ? - He 's a biker . Dude , what the fuck . Young man , want a little advice ? No , man , fuck you . Jesus ... What 's happening . You must be here about the star leaf . Well , come on up . Always happy to have some close encounters . Glad you could make it . Meet my girls . Aren 't they beauties ? Speaking of beauty , what in the world do they put in the water , where you 're from ? What 's up man . Alright , hey , have a seat here . These pillows ain 't just for show . Take a load off . My queen . Well , what can I do for you ? Well , we came here for the star leaf map . Of course you did . Oh , right , right , of course . My bad . Total human optimization , gotta love that . And that 's the point , really , isn 't it ? Coming back , time and time again , this reality , that reality , perfecting ourselves , slowly over the course of infinity . It 's like , somewhere out there , is a giant disco-ball , casting countless reflections . And each one of us , is a tiny piece of that infinite light . Dude , shut up . Oh , sorry . Yeah , the brain isn 't what it used to be , since the fall . That 's why I need these babies . You fell and hurt your head ? Well , cosmologically speaking , yes . But not all those that fall , are fallen . What ? Did I forget something ? The gummy snacks . Oh , shit . I 'm so sorry . I forgot the gummy snacks . See , this is what happens when you don 't write shit down . The Queen loves the gummy snacks . That 's your favorite . Right , Darling ? You like that watermelon flavor , don 't you ? We 'll get it next time . Does that mean that we ... No worries . No worries . Now , I assume whoever told you about the star leaf , clued you into the code of conduct ? Yes ... No photos . No video . No GPS . You can 't take any seeds or clippings from the site , although you can smoke as much as you want , while you 're there . And you gotta destroy the map . Yeah , and you cannot leave a trace . Right , right . - Capisce ? - Affirmative . I 've seen that before . You can read that ? No , but I saw it when I was high up in the Kush . I didn 't take you for an O.G. Kush fan . I 'm talking about the Hindu Kush . The mountain range where we were fighting for our country . Not sitting on a fucking puff-pad , getting stoned all fucking day . Okay , okay , you 're gonna have to excuse my friend . He 's still decompressing from his last tour , and he 'll need some time . It took me a while too . Come on , man . Why is it on your wall ? The real question is , why is it still in your head ? He got you . Fuck you guys . All right , who 's ready to get weird ? The actual star leaf ... Now hold up , Moon-dog . This is isn 't the actual star leaf . It 's just a distant cousin . Put it in your mouth , baby . And suck it . You mean to tell me that this star leaf , is actually from outer space ? We are outer space . Macrocosms , microcosms ... Yeah , that . What he said . The actual star leaf map . The map 's free . The journey isn 't . Well , I hope you all have a blast . Right out of this world . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you both for your hospitality . Thanks . From the halls of Montezuma , to the shores of Tripoli . We fight our country 's battles In the air , on land , and sea . First to fight for right and freedom And to keep our honor clean . We are proud to claim the title of United States Marines . Whoa ! It is sexy as fuck out here . Yeah . It beats dirty-ass hippy drug dens . Yeah . How far away is La Push from here ? Dude , the beach ain 't going anywhere . We 've got an adventure in these woods here , first . I mean , are you sure we 're even in the right place ? Yeah , dude . Look at the marking right there . There 's tons of them , all down this road . Dude , check your bag . Make sure you 've got all your stuff there . It 's a long walk , we might have to setup camp . Quick pit stop , my ass , nectar boy . Wait a second . Wait , you said we 're camping here ? I thought we were camping on the beach . Babe , we can do all that Twilight tour stuff later . Come on , this is really important for me . No , no , no , no way , now way . Bella 's Sunset tour is on , bitch . You promised . He promised . Hey , you know Edward is like 400 years old , and still tries to fuck high school kids . Whatevs . We 're just gonna hump all this gear along , in case we camp tonight ? Yeah . Dude , why don 't you just admit it to yourself that your whole entire plan for being up here is to smoke yourself into oblivion . What are you talking about ? Just drop the fucking act already , man . No , no , no , I mean , we 're going to find star leaf . And if we find some , I just think it 'd be prudent of us to smoke a little . Dude said no photos . Why do you care ? Come on , babe . Your online fan-base has enough pouty-face selfies for one day . Put it away , come on . What about his stupid camera ? This thing 's off , okay ? I just didn 't wanna leave it in the car . I didn 't feel like it was safe . Yeah , well , I actually don 't safe leaving my iPhone in the car , so ... Babe , Martha , sweetie , come on . - Don 't give me that shit . - I just need you , to play by the rules , this one time . Promise me you 'll turn it off and keep it off . Why ? You know ? I mean what 's the big deal ? The big deal is that the phone 's GPS data will give away the location of the weed . Fine . I can 't believe they trust us at all , out here . I wouldn 't . Come on , let 's giddy-up ! Man sure likes his weed . He likes a lot of things . And he isn 't afraid to go after them , either . Hey , here , swing back on me . Hey , time for chow . Yes , please , I 'm so hungry . Put something in my mouth . Anything . Girl , you crazy . Take a piece . Oh , fuck . It tastes like shit . What 's in it ? Shit ? It 's my new edible recipe . Ganesha 's groovy granola . I mean , it could use some more agave . But it 's pretty good for homemade . Edible , as in weed edible ? Yeah . What the fuck is your problem , man ? Two problems . Hungry and sober . Eat some granola , bam ! Two birds , one stoner . What ? Oh , whoa my dude 's crafty . - Give it up - Yep . You got it , baby . What the F ? Whoa . Those branches look like alien fingers . Just some random branch configuration . Nothing to bust a nut on . Yeah ? Then why is it pointing in the exact direction of the star leaf ? Just a random coincidence . James doesn 't believe in aliens . Where 's the proof ? Ahh ... Exactly . Come on , man . Don 't tell me you never even entertained the idea . Some people say they are the jinn of Islam . Wait , what are the jinn ? Demons . Tim ? I have never seen trees like this before . Is this on the map ? I mean , I think so . I think it 's these outlines , right here . I had no idea what those meant until right now . That 's weird . The grove should just be up this way . Wait , what 's with all these bulges ? Tree tumors , maybe ? You never complained about bulging wood before . Honey , if your wood was bulging like this , I 'd take you to a doctor . Dude , what if these are all filled with the sweetest fucking resin you ever had ? We should tap these babies and get some sweet-ass , star leaf syrup . Woo ! Sip , sippin ' on some sizzurp . Help me up . Sippin ' on some sizzurp . Sippin ' on some sizzurp . These branches look sharp enough to kill . Yeah , I guess mother nature don 't take no prisoners , huh ? I mean , either that or she wanted to keep this place a secret for a reason . Ugh ! Ugh ! Babe , that 's not actually star leaf syrup . Well , it 's still gross . - James ! - James ! James ! Oh , my god ! Welcome to the garden of Weeden , motherfucker ! - Ta da ! - We found it ! I told you ! I think I 've seen bigger plants than this in Afghanistan . Dude , you see all these other plants ? Fuck them . It 's about this one , right here . This is the queen bee , the mother of all marijuana plants on planet Earth . They say she was seeded from outer space , and sent to us by some extraterrestrial intelligence , to help us find our way back . Wow , man . Back from what ? Well , fuck if I know ! I just came to smoke this shit ! Oh , my god ! Whoa , brother . Jesus , chill out , man . What ? You 're being an asshole to that plant right now . You know what ? You 're right . - Chill . - Alright . You 're right . I 'm being kind of an asshole to this plant . I need to step aside for a minute , center myself , come back , snip some buds , and proceed to get fucking baked . Awesome . You don 't think he 's addicted , do you ? Him ? No , he 's always been like that . First guy in high school to tap a keg , unsnap a bra ... Dude 's a legend . Well , speaking of legends , I 've heard a lot about you , James . Yeah ? Yeah , I wasn 't sure if we 'd hit it off at first . But you know , so far so good . Look , Tim 's my bro . Yeah . I just wanted to thank you for your services . Okay . Tim ? Alright , this is ready . Who 's ready to blast off ? Oh , me , me , me . Oh , you know , before we commence this ceremony , we should say like a little prayer , you know ? Kind of get into it . Out loud , or what ? Whatever you feel comfortable with . Roll , roll , roll the joint . Twist it at the ends . Take a puff and that 's enough , now pass it to your friends . Man , what kind of eastern bullshit you been studying ? Well , have you ever heard of Tantra ? No . Cause he has , and it 's divine . It 's an ancient Vedic sexual ecstasy practice . No big deal . No big deal ? I 'd say marathon love-making sessions , ending in multiple female ejaculation , is kind of a big deal . Jesus , fuck , calm down . That 's it . I can 't . Dude , this leaves no trace in your system . Okay . Oh , my god . Guys , I can 't move . I can 't move , guys . Did I ever tell you that I used to be Jim Morrison in a past life ? I 'm so hot . I make fire jealous . Right ? Baby , look at me . I haven 't danced like this since 69 . You look like you 're having a fucking seizure . You 're not Jim Morrison . Tim , you 're gonna fall in the fire . What 'd you say ? You want me to light your fire ? Do you think I 'm pretty ? Yo ... Your ... That is the sweetest thing anyone 's ever said to me . Tim 's too busy jerking off , to Asian fairy porn , to notice me anymore . Do you like Asian fairy porn ? Of course you do . All men do . Tim ... Tim , you 're gonna fall in the fire . What in the fuck just happened ? Threw some sticks on the fire , homie . You feeling it ? What ? Here , hit this . No , fuck no . All right , suit yourself . Did you guys kill anyone when you were in Afghanistan ? Why you gotta go bringing everyone down like that ? You 're on a crazy train right now , and it 's time to get off . I 'm sorry . I know you 're high right now , but you need to stop . I 'm sorry , war makes me laugh . Maybe this is enough for one night . Did you see that ? The shooting star ? Yeah . Whoa ! What the hell ? Jesus . Oh , dude ! They don 't call this star leaf for nothing . Full-on visuals ! Wait , where do stars come from , anyway ? Same place we do . Everything 's star dust , baby . Fuck . Do you hear that ? This weed is getting trippy . Maybe we should all just get up , and like walk around . No , dude . I fucking heard something out there . Really ? Shit , there 's movement out there ! Dude , sit down . It 's just voices in your head , alright ? I 'm fucking telling you , man . I heard somebody talking out there , in Pashto . What the hell is Pashto ? It 's an Afghan dialect . It 's just voices in your head , alright ? They get louder when there 's no city noise to drown them out . He 's right . What the hell ? City noise does tend to drown out a lot . Doesn 't it ? Unfortunately , city people , such as yourselves , make so much noise , you can hear them miles away , in the dead of night . Talking about the secrets of the universe , and all kinds of interesting stuff , people like to talk about when they 're high . Hmm ? Oh , look at that . Mmm . It is legal now . No prescription necessary . I 'm sorry , old habits die hard . Officer ? Forrest ranger . I 'm just out making my rounds . Walking the trails with the snakes and the snails . Checking the pines for those evergreen crimes . Hmm ? We found some evergreen , alright . That you did , honey . That you did . Here you go . - Thank you . - Yeah . You folks mind if I take a knee ? Please . Have a seat , son . Fire 's getting cold . Well , look at that . Marshmallows and everything . Wow , you kids sure know how to enjoy the great outdoors . I 'll give you that . So , is this place something that you and the other forest rangers know about ? We 've been coming here a long time , son . Oh , you mean like the indigenous first peoples ? I 'm talking about everyone . From everywhere . Do you see a lot of wildlife ? I saw a moose fucking a bear once . Wait , you saw what ? Moose , fucking a bear . No , man . What , are you telling me you 've never seen something strange before ? Something only you , and no one else could see ? Hmm ? You folks wanna get high ? - Yeah . - Yeah . Well , you can certainly get high , right ? Whoa . It 's not how high you go that matters . It 's where you go . Ah , I like the way you think , officer . - Ranger . - Ranger ... Ranger . Ranger . Ranger Dave . All right , well ... You folks have a good night . And enjoy the great outdoors . What the fuck was that ? Did that really just happen ? I have no idea what the dude was talking about . Do you think he was lying about a moose fucking a bear ? I don 't know , with the weed we 've been smoking , I 'd kinda believe him . Oh , man . Man , I don 't even think he was real , though . Yeah , man , he was real . Okay , I 'm going to bed . You know what ? I 'm gonna follow you . I don 't want any close encounters of the moose-rape kind . Ooh , I actually wouldn 't mind seeing that . Well , get in that tent , and I 'll show you what a moose dick looks like . Let me in first . No ! They 'll be coming for you , James . They 've have their eye on you a long time . Long time ... But you already knew that . Didn 't you ? Hmm ? Careful where you 're going , now . You never know what you might find . Who the fuck are you ? Stay the fuck away from my friends ! Get up , goddamn it ! We 've got hostiles ! Shit . James ! Martha ? What are you doing out here ? Waiting for you to find me . We have to go back to the camp . Where 's Tim ? The plant can help you , James . What ? It 's a portal , don 't you see ? To the stars . What are you talking about ? Where are your clothes ? These can 't help you . Share your pain with me , James . No , I don 't need saving . Come here . Fuck ! Tim ? Tim ? What ? How the hell did we get out here ? I don 't know . We must 've been higher than we thought . Yeah . Where 's James ? Probably smart enough to sleep in his own tent . I guess . Well , we better check . Wait a sec . Ooh , now this is the bulging wood I came to see . Top of the morning to you , too . Morning glory , or whatever it is . Tim ? Martha ? - Shit ! - What ? Get down . Get down . What the hell is going on ? What are you guys doing out here ? There 's something behind that tree . It was watching us . What the fuck you talking about ? The fucking tree , right there , was watching us . Please go check it out . No , to your left ! Here ? The big one ! Do you see anything ? Nothing ! Maybe it was just that moose fucking . It wasn 't a fucking moose . It wasn 't a fucking moose . Fuck this , man . Okay , give me my shirt , I 'm leaving . Hurry up ! We gotta go ! What , did you see something ? I said we gotta go ! Leave the fucking tents ! I said leave them , come on ! - Coming . - All right ! I don 't know . We 're probably all just still high . No , I know what I saw . You saw the lights last night too ? - No . - Yeah , dude . We all saw the shooting star . I 'm not talking about the shooting star . What the hell are you talking about then ? That blinding light that ... Fuck ! Whoa ! What the fuck is that ? - Jesus ! - Just go man ! - Go ! - Just go ! Holy fucking shit ! What the fuck is that , man ? Calm down . Get off ! Run her over ! Honk the horn ! It 's some kind of animal or something ! - Go , motherfucker go ! - Just run it over ! Just go ! Just go around . Babe , we 're in a Prius . It 's not built for off-road activity . What are you doing ? We must 've missed an off-road or something . - Shit ! - Holy shit . It 's an ambush . What the fuck are you talking about , an ambush ? We 're in a kill-zone . A what zone ? A kill-zone ! Grab your packs , hurry ! Fuck . - Shit ... - Come on , let 's go ! Come on ! Come on ! What the hell is going on ? Some kind of ambush . Who would be ambushing us ? Just get your shit . What the fuck is the holdup , man ? Come on ! What the hell is that ? Grab that shit and let 's go ! What the hell is that ? Is that fucking star leaf ? You have fucking star leaf clippings ? He fucking has star leaf clippings . You 're fucking us over , you realize that ? You guys . You guys . - Are you serious ? - He fucked us over . Are you serious ? Man , get rid of that shit ! Dude , it 's not that much , okay ? I just needed a little , to make some clones when I got home , alright ? Look , you guys are freaking out way too much . We all just need to calm ... Whoa , dude ! What the fuck ? Tim ? Baby ? Baby ? What the fuck just grabbed me ? Baby , are you okay ? Look at me . Let me see . Let me see . Tim ? Martha ? Okay ... James Hunter , Sergeant , United States Marine Corps . I 'm here , in Washington state , in the Olympic National Rainforest . I know this is gonna sound crazy . But something really , fucked up is happening right now . And to be honest , I have no idea what . Fuck . I know this looks cheesy as hell , staring down into a camera , like some bullshit scene from some horror film . But I promise you , this is real , okay ? In case something happens , hopefully somebody will find this footage , and try to make some sense out of all this . It 's been an hour . Still no sign of my friends . Think I 'm gonna head west , towards the Pacific ocean , away from the peaks . Hopefully I 'll run into some kind of fucking civilization out there . I just have no idea what the hell I 'm doing , still . But , I don 't know , I 'm ... Fuck . Lower your weapon . Lower your weapon . Now this , my friend ... This is one hell of a violation , of park regulations . Look , I can put in a good word , about you using this thing here , considering your current state of mind and all . But as for them ... They chose to break the rules , of their own free will . My friends are dead and you 're talking to me about the fucking rules ? I 'll show you some fucking rules ! If you can 't follow a few simple rules , like not taking photos ... Or as in his case , stealing himself some souvenirs to take home . How are we supposed to trust all of you , with the secrets to the universe , huh ? You tell me that . I can 't believe I killed them . Well , let 's go check , make sure . Yeah , they 're dead . You got a permit for this ? I found it . Wow . I guess it 's your lucky day then . You sure as hell know how to shoot it . Don 't you ? Yes . Louder . Yes , sir . I can 't hear you , maggot ! Sir , yes sir ! Sound off like you 've got a pair ! Sir , yes sir ! James ? Oh , my god . We found you . Who are you yelling at ? What are you doing with that ? I don 't believe this . What ? You 're dead . What are you talking about ? I killed you guys . Dude , that star leaf really messed with us . We need to just calm down , find a place to chill . I 'm sorry . About what ? What 's he talking about , baby ? We didn 't know that there would be a kid . Dude , you 're in Washington state now , okay ? You 're safe . You wanted me to take the shot so bad , didn 't you ? The pink mist ... It 's yours . Take the shot . Take the shot . Take the shot ! Honey , honey , it 's okay . No ! No ! James ! My boy 's lost it , completely . They told you not to touch their stuff . Why 'd you do it ? Had I known it would get this crazy , I never would 've looked for it in the first place . Hey , when we get back to the car , don 't let me forget to pick up the clippings . So I can take them back to the grove . Look , you 're right . This whole thing is ... No , you know what ? This is fucking bullshit . Babe , calm down . You 're just having a bad trip . Take the beads , they 'll give you some - peace and calm . - No , fuck your hippy beads ! What 's your problem ? Look , I 'm not the only one who broke the fucking rules . No , get off me ! Get off me ! - Yeah . - Give me that . - Uh-huh . Uh-huh - No , no , no . - Give me that ! - Yeah , yeah , I 'm the asshole . I 've seen the way you look at James . I 'm not a slut . Fuck him . Who gives a shit anyway ? What the fuck was he talking about back there , huh ? The pink mist ? What 's the big fucking secret , huh ? Tell me . Tell me . What 'd you fucking do back there ? What did you do back there ? You fucking killed someone ? You fucking killed someone , is that what you did ? You 're a fucking coward , hiding behind a plant . Yeah , who the fuck do you think you are ? Ugh ! God ! When we were out , risking our lives for our country , you were here fucking every guy in town . Ah , shit ! We are friends . We 're friends . Oh , yeah ? You like my beads ? Maybe she can help us find a way out of here . Hey ... We need some help , yo . Fuck ! Tim ! Fuck ! Oh , god . Oh , my god . No , no , no . Tim ! Forget something ? Shit . You disappoint me , man . No , no , no . You 're not real . Oh , I 'm real . And it 's about to get really real . No , no . You don 't exist . You 're not real . This is my brain on drugs . Yeah , you 're tripping , man . You 're tripping . And it 's a trip straight to hell . You 're just a figment of our imagination , our collective imagination . You don 't exist . You disappoint me . Go away ! Boo . Boo . What the fuck ? What is this place ? Where the fuck are we ? Did you write that ? This is my stuff . Where 'd you get this stuff , huh ? This is my fucking sunglasses , my phone ... Where 'd you get this ? Oh , my god ! Thank god . Fuck . Yes ... What the fuck are you doing here ? Oh , just checking things out . I hear you got yourself in a bit of a jam . Nice to see you 're working it out . I 'm telling you , my friend is a fucking idiot , okay ? He didn 't mean to take anything ... Oh , he took it . He took it , alright . And I 'm afraid he meant to . I 'm telling you , man . He didn 't mean to do any ... You see this leaf ? Most people think it 's only job is to make them feel good . But feeling good really isn 't what they want . What they want , this plant can 't give them . Well , what 's that ? What 's troubling you , man ? Excuse me ? What happened to you , over there in Afghanistan ? You saw something else over there , didn 't you ? Same thing you saw at my place . Do you know what it means ? It 's a doorway . Closed on one side , open on the other . But our plant friends , you see ... They can only show you the door . They can 't walk you through it . So what about those things we keep seeing ? Well , they 're no friends of mine . I 'll tell you that . They 're more of a nuisance , really . Well , what do they want ? Man , your karma is like a magnet . They 're drawn to it . Like vultures , in the night , waiting . Waiting for what ? To feed of your conflict . They use you to form these charged emotional patterns , so they can share in a kind of awareness fulfillment , that they 're otherwise denied . What ? What the fuck are you talking about ? No ... Go on ! Get out of here ! Go back to where you came from ! There ain 't nothing here for you ! Go on ! Did you see that , man ? What the fuck did you just say ? Oh , it 's just an old Jewish nursery rhyme for kids . What ? Yeah , you know , it works in a pinch . But it ain 't gonna work for long . You better get back to your friends . They 're gonna need you . Go on . Hell yeah . Tim ? Martha ? - James ? - What the fuck ? - James , please . - Help us get down . - Please help us . - Please , before he ... There he is ! Been waiting for you . Who the hell are you , man ? What the fuck do you want ? I tried to warn you . Others tried as well . The star leaf ... Well , that 's a special leaf , as you know . Yeah ? What 's so special about it , huh ? It 's a star gate . It opens up a door to great healing . Also great chaos , if not navigated skillfully . Through this door , all kinds of beings emerge . Some good , some not so good . Shit . You ever ask yourself if you really had a choice or not ? Pulling that trigger ? Huh ? I mean , who 's to say ? I 'm just being theoretical . But who 's to say you happened to save the lives of 13 innocent Afghan civilians . Just saying . God , I don 't fucking deserve this , okay ? I don 't deserve this ! This is bullshit ! You can save them the fate of what awaits them . Put them out of their misery right now , hmm ? Untie me , now ! I just wanted to get a little high , I 'm so sorry . Will you just please shoot his ass already ? Fuck you . Fuck all of you . I 'm not gonna shoot my friends . I 'm not shooting my friends ! You hear that ? I really wouldn 't test them like that . And you ... I 've had enough of your fucking bullshit . Easy now . Fuck easy . Why shouldn 't I blow your fucking head off , right now ? Because you 're not a murderer , James . A killer , maybe . But not a murderer . What ? Bad things happen . But you 're forgiven . That 's all the plant is trying to tell you . It wants to help you , James . It does . It really does . Help ? It wants to help me ? Is that what it wants ? Huh ? Huh ? Is this what you think is gonna help me ? Huh ? What the fuck ! Seriously ? How about this ? Huh ? Or maybe this . You might wanna think this one through . You 're making a terrible choice . You wanna see it , don 't you . See what ? The pink mist . James , no ! Careful what you wish for . You just might find it . No , James . No ! Dude ... Where are we ? That place I was telling you about . Martha ? Tim ? Yeah ? You 're okay ? Yeah , are you okay , dude ? We haven 't even smoked any weed yet , and you 're acting like a freak . Anyway , dude , like I was saying . In this house , there 's a dude that 's gonna give us a map to the secret grove , here in the Olympics . The stuff is called star leaf . It opens a lot of doors to the supernatural . Are you ready ? Let 's go . Wait . Dude , how about the kid ? What ? What kid ? What are you talking about ? I know this sounds crazy . But , you made the right choice that day . You made the right call . Wait , what kid ? Listen , man , I know you 're suffering from some P.T.S.D. from then . But that 's why I brought you here . We 're gonna fix all that . Bullshit , man . You don 't wanna put in the real fucking work . What fucking work ? You saw him too . In the spotter 's scope . It ain 't even like that for me . I 'm not mad at you . And I don 't blame you for shit . I promise . You have no idea how badly I needed to hear that from you . Come on , man . Shit . Oh , god , the federales . Let 's get in . Come on ! All right , these dudes mess with Black people all the time . I have a fucking thing that I do . Just shut up and listen . It 's him . Who ? What brings you fine folks out to these parts ? Oh , I just think we made a wrong turn . You did not make a wrong turn . You 're exactly where you need to be . The question is , did you or did you not come here to purchase marijuana ? Depends . You got the sticky icky ? Well , if the sticky icky is what you 're looking for , my friend here , Seth , would love to help you out . Thanks , man , but we 're heading out . Dude . Let 's pull out of here , and stick to the original plan , hanging out and surfing at the beach . The beach ? You folks heading to La Push ? Yeah , but we 've gotta make one little stop in Forks first . You folks must be Twilight fans then . Yeah , well , she thinks people will ask her for her autograph cause she kinda looks like the chick from the movie . Yeah , do you see the resemblance ? No , not really . Then again , I ain 't got much time to watch movies . Too busy walking the trails with the snakes and snails . Checking the pines for those evergreen crimes . You folks happen to see a wondering moose ? Looking a little lonely ? No . Well , let me know if you see him . Gotta go now . It 's nice talking to you , officer . Forest ranger ... Maybe next time , man . No worries , bro . All is forgiven . All is forgiven . Get the fuck out of here , man . Little souvenir for you . The kid got his head right , after all . That he did . That he did . God damn , I came all the way back , to hang out with you guys , for shit waves and no sun . What ? It 's beautiful ! This is the high that I came for . You telling me that you didn 't already get high today ? Oh , no , I totally got high today . But this is the one that I came for . You 're a fucking idiot , man . Let 's fucking do this , man ! Don 't go so fast ! Nice . Yeah that 's holding up really well . I see you got your 108 little beads there , to keep you occupied while we sort this out . One for the one . Zero for the nothing . Eight for infinity . Yeah , I guess it feels like infinity sometimes , don 't it ? Yeah , it 's silly . I know . But , you know , rules are rules . But , I got a good feeling about that friend of yours . Yeah , a good feeling . All right , well , shalom , shalom , baby .

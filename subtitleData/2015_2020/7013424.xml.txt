Like Billy crams tons of crayons in his butt . Which I didn 't ! But it 's really impossible to cram a ton of crayons in a butt . - No , no , I 'm sorry , I shouldn 't say that . - Okay , Billy , I would honestly hang outwith you , but I have a date every night with the Angel Grove Sheriff 's Department . So ... I 'm sorry . Wait ... no , no , no . Don 't leave , don 't leave , hey . All right , so I don 't really expect for us to hang out .

It 's gonna go ... Billy , come on ! - [ rapid beeping continues ] - What ? [ long beep , Chirp ] [ country music playing on stereo ] Thank you . Mmm-hmm . Can you stop touching me now ? [ Billy ] It 's so cool you actually showed up . [ Jason ] Well , you are giving me the van . Lending you the van . But , yeah . How much further is it ? Just 44 minutes and 52 seconds . Uh ...

I know you used to date Ty Fleming . Oh . Then you know I punched his tooth out . I know they put it back . [ Billy panting ] Dad , I hope you 're watching . Gonna make you proud . Dad , I forgot to tell you , uh , I took the van without asking Mom 's permission . Well , I 'm telling you , so I think that 's okay . [ grunts ] Anyways , I gotta focus . Okay . So what are you doing up here ? Did you follow me ? I , uh , came with ... Billy . Billy Cranston ? Weird . But I 've seen him up here before . My house is on the other side of the mountain .

Different-colored kids ! - I 'm so excited you 're here ! - [ all gasp ] Turn around . Go on . [ Jason ] No way . [ Alpha 5 ] Proceed . Think this 'll work . One , two , three , four , five . Different colors . Guys , let 's focus on getting out of here . Stay together , and then when we see a chance ... - We run like hell . - Okay . And if we don 't get a chance ? Then we kill it . Shouldn 't hurt , but let 's see . Please , step into the footprints . No . We are not going to do that . Hey , question . Um , what are you ?

[ Zordon ] Yes . Yes , very good , Billy . It is called the Zeo Crystal . [ Alpha 5 ] Oh , I love this part . This is good . And every planet in the universe that has life has a piece of the crystal buried inside it . [ Alpha 5 ] Sixty-five million years ago , Zordon 's team died defending the crystal here in what is now Angel Grove . - [ Zordon ] The coins have chosen you five . - [ Alpha 5 ] Yes ! I knew it ! Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal and life on earth . Because ... we ... are the Power Rangers ? - He 's smart ! - [ Kimberly scoffs ] I 'm sorry , um , is this some kind of joke ? Like , I 'm standing here with a wet wedgie . My socks are soaked . We 're squishing around in here . We 're talking to a wall . I mean , guys ... - Silence ! - [ gasps ] [ door creaking ] [ Rita ] Dig ! Dig , Goldar ! [ people screaming ] [ breathing rapidly ] [ Power Rangers gasping ] [ coughing ] [ Alpha 5 ] Sir , I 'm detecting elevated heart rates . They 're ... they 're very scared . I don 't understand . Why would you show us that nightmare ? [ Zordon ] It 's not a nightmare . It 's the future . - Was that for real ? - Felt like it . - And who was that woman ? - Her name is Rita Repulsa . She will create Goldar , a huge monster who will rip the crystal from the earth , and all life on your planet will die . With the crystal , Rita will have the power to create and destroy worlds . So , let me guess . You want us to kill this woman ? R ... Rita ? Ay , ay , ay ! Rita ! She must be stopped . When is she coming ? [ Alpha 5 ] She 's already here . My best guess is we have 11 months . Oh , I 'm sorry , days . Days , 11 days . [ Trini ] If we 're the Power Rangers and this is our ship , if I walk through that door right now , will it open for me ? Yes , of course . Let 's go . - [ Alpha 5 ] Whoa , what you doing ? - [ sighs ] No , no , no , come back ! No . No , please , don 't leave . [ Zordon ] Jason , my ranger team died defending the crystal from Rita . That 's why I 'm in this wall . How 'd you know my name ? Because it 's you , Jason Scott . You are the leader . You are the Red Ranger . Rita was a ranger , too . And my friend . But she betrayed us . Wanted more power . She lost her way . Now she is just pure evil . You must bring them back . All of the rangers . You must train your team to stop Rita before she has the strength to find the crystal . Okay . I 'm leaving . - And I only speak for myself when I ... - No ! You speak for all of them . You know that , deep down , what I 'm saying is true . You were born for this . You all waited . Even you . Who ... exactly are you ? Really ? Now you 're gonna ask me who I am ? - Look , her name is Didi . - Trini . She 's new at school . Transferred in a month ago . We have English together , right ? I 've been at Angel Grove for over a year now . We have biology together . Good talk . Wait , look ... none of us really know each other , okay ? But somehow ... we were all in the same place at the same time when Billy found those coins . - And ... - Wait , wait , wait ! Can I ask a question ? Are we really superheroes ? Like are we more like Iron Man or Spider-Man ? 'Cause I feel like I been bit by a spider , but I feel really good , you know , not as ... [ chuckling ] All right , look , bro , trust me , you 're not a superhero . Why are you talking to us like you 're the boss now ? Hey , hold up . Can any of this Rita stuff be real ? Can any of it be true ? I don 't know . But I know that the answer to what 's wrong with us and to what 's happening to us ... is here . - So what are you saying ? - [ water sloshing ] I think we gotta come back . I can 't make you come back here . But 4 : 00 tomorrow ... I 'll be here . Hey , Jason , we don 't ... we don 't ... [ scoffs ] - That makes sense . That makes sense . - Of course . I don 't know why I didn 't think about that one in the first place . [ thunder rumbling ] [ both speaking Mandarin ] So where were you today ? Were you with friends ? Do you have any friends ? - Why are you so tired ... - Okay , this is the problem . You ask her four questions before she 's even answered the first . Because she 's like a ghost around here . She needs to start communicating . - June ... - Say something . - Speak ! I just ... - Relax . Okay . Relax . Okay , Trini , let 's start over . Please tell us one thing you did today . Me and four kids from Angel Grove found a spaceship buried underground . What ? I 'm pretty sure I 'm a superhero . Cool . Not cool . Pee in that cup ! This to remind me of my screw-up ? No . [ sighs ] Wrecking yard only offered me 300 bucks for it and ... you know , the frame 's straight and the engine still runs . Figure I 'd leave it up to you to decide if you wanted to fix it . Oh , shit . [ officer ] Mr. Scott , there 's been an incident on your boat . It 's a terrible situation . You gotta come with me . [ newscaster ] A series of grisly crime scenes has the sleepy fishing hamlet of Angel Grove reeling . - Bodies were discovered ... - [ Rita ] I 'm building Goldar for you ... This rash of violence has the town on edge . [ rock music playing ] [ Rita singsong ] Goldar 's coming . Goldar 's coming . Goldar 's coming . Goldar 's coming . What the hell you doing ? [ Rita ] I need gold . I will build my beautiful Goldar . [ singsong ] Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal . I take the universe . Me , too ! [ laughing ] [ inhaling raggedly ] [ Rita snarls ] [ man groaning ] [ man screaming ] - [ chuckles ] What 's up , crazy girl ? - Hey . [ Jason ] Shall we do this ? [ Zordon ] You need to follow the three rules to being a Power Ranger . You must never use your powers for personal gain . You must never escalate a fight , unless your enemy forces you to . And you must never reveal your identity . Ever . To assume your ranger identities , you need to morph . Have any of you morphed before ? - Yes . But only in the shower . - [ all snickering ] Okay , okay . Let 's step into the footprints , please . Let 's try this . Standing in this circle as a team , you can easily connect to the morphing grid . - Do you feel it ? - [ Alpha 5 ] Yeah , they do . No . Not feeling it . [ Zordon ] You need to morph to get your armor . [ gasps ] I knew it ! We do get armor . [ chuckles ] Jason ! We get armor ! Oh , we get armor . Cool . When do you give us the armor ? [ Zordon ] You already have it inside of you . You bring it out by connecting to each other and connecting to the morphing grid . Clear your minds and focus . Power Rangers were a legion of warriors sworn to protect life . [ Alpha 5 ] Yes ! [ Zordon ] You must become those warriors . [ Alpha 5 ] Become the warriors ! - [ Alpha 5 groans ] - [ Kimberly ] What ? What ? What , did it ... did it work ? Alpha 5 , why didn 't they morph ? Yeah , I don 't ... I don 't know , sir . It 's ... it 's disturbing . Very disturbing . This might take some time . We don 't have time . If they can 't morph , what are we supposed to do ? [ Zordon ] They 'll have to train without armor . - They need to prepare . - Without armor ? Sir , that 'll be very painful . Take them down to the pit . [ sighs ] All right , follow me . We 're going to the pit ! Jason , I don 't wanna find out what the pit is . So this is the pit . It 's nice , right ? [ Zordon ] Alpha 5 , begin the exercise . [ Alpha 5 ] Uh ... sorry , guys . - What exercise ? - Chill out , dude . [ Zordon ] These creatures before you are a simulation of Rita 's army . They 're called Putties . You must get through them to get to her . [ Billy ] No , no , no , no , Jason . Cool . Look , relax , guys . It 's a hologram . - Like a video game . Look . - [ grunting ] - [ groans ] - Whoa ! - [ groans ] - [ Billy ] That 's a strong-ass hologram . [ laughs ] [ hoarsely ] Not a video game . [ Zordon ] This is why you must morph into your armor . If Rita becomes strong enough to build her army , it 'll be the beginning of the end . Rangers , welcome to training . - I 'm so excited you guys are back . - [ pop music playing ] - Aim for the center mass . - [ groans ] One more time . Come on , duck the punches . Find their weak side . - [ grunts ] - Oh ... Let 's go a couple o ' hits , okay ? Hit one ... No , let 's try it again . [ Alpha 5 ] Now this is exciting . [ both grunting ] Yeah , Trini ! - [ grunts ] - [ groans ] [ Both ] Hai ! Ready , master Billy ? [ groans ] You need to learn the element of surprise . Ready ? Let 's go again . All right , Billy , lighter on your feet . Hands up . [ Zack speaking Mandarin ] [ school bell ringing ] [ coach ] Play with some energy now ! Let 's go ! [ all grunting ] [ Alpha 5 ] Focus ! Focus ! Everybody just focus ! - [ exclaims ] - [ Putty groans ] Lucky shot . [ grunts ] You guys all know you could be murdered , right ' ? No . [ both chuckle ] [ Zordon ] You must shed your masks to wear this armor . [ Billy ] I don 't feel anything . [ Zack groans ] [ Zordon ] Take them down to the pit . [ Alpha 5 ] Now watch me ... slip , grab , lift . Yeah ! Slip , grab , lift ! [ grunting ] Yes ! [ Zordon ] Think only of each other , and the morphing grid will open to you . Is it working ? [ Trini ] No , it 's not . Come on ! Try harder ! [ Jason ] Let 's just concentrate . [ Trini ] I 've been concentrating though , Jason . [ Zack ] ' Cause we haven 't been concentrating ... all we need to do is just concentrate . Don 't tell me to concentrate . Just follow my lead . Let 's not fight with each other . [ Trini ] Zack , now is not the time . [ frustrated groan ] Come on . Let 's go train . The information we need to triangulate the location of the crystal was lost in the battle . So ... Billy , are you listening to me ? Billy , what are you doing ? - Billy ! - [ country music plays on stereo ] Where 's the crystal ? Find it , Billy , find it . Where 's the crystal ? [ grunts ] There . One , two ... Okay , 17 degrees north ... [ driver ] Hey , idiot , watch where you 're going ! - One , two , three ... - [ driver 2 ] Wake up ! [ newscaster ] Two fishermen were laid to rest today at Saint Andrew 's Cemetery . Residents of Angel Grove are feeling the shock . Fear has the town on edge . This series of murders has police baffled as police have linked the loss of gold to each crime scene . What is now being dubbed " Angel Grove 's Gold Killer " is still on the loose . ... Rita manages to create Goldar ... [ grunts ] Are you listening to me ? - [ grunts ] - And he rips the crystal from the ground , it 'll be like 10,000 nuclear bombs washing over Earth . [ Zack ] Supposed to freak us out ? You keep making this harder . We 're busting our asses . Feel free to throw us a bone at some point . Yes , I see you busting your " asses . " So I 've decided to give you some inspiration . What you will find beyond this wall will forever change your lives . Come on . [ all chattering excitedly ] The Zords ! - Pretty cool , right ' ? - [ Billy ] Yeah . They take on the form of the most powerful organism on the planet . When these Zords formed , dinosaurs reigned supreme . They will be an extension of you . And their power ... is all but limitless . [ Billy whoops , laughs ] But you 're not ready for this power . When you morph , your armor will make you one with the Zords . So come on , let 's go train . Today 's the day you become rangers ! I can feel it ! - Okay . - Let 's go . Yeah . Let 's go . [ Zord roars ] [ Zack yelling ] This was a bad idea . Okay , okay , uh , signals , brakes . Brakes , I need brakes ! Manual . Man-u-al . Where are the brakes ... Alpha 5 ! [ Zack screaming ] Ahh ! Oh , crap ! Hey ! Move ! Move ! Out of the way ! [ all ] ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ [ Zack screaming ] You have to remember that in today 's training lesson the important thing is to ... - Wait . Where 's Zack ? - Seriously ? Run , run , run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! [ yelping ] - [ all screaming ] - [ Alpha 5 ] It 's bad ! [ coughing ] [ all groaning ] You all right ? - [ splutters ] Ay , ay , ay ! - [ Zack whoops ] All right , my bad , my bad . That 's on me , right there . What 's your problem ? You could 've killed yourself . Or us . - Back off , bossman . - Hey ! [ Billy ] Oh , come on , guys . Wow . - Guys , guys , guys , come on ! - Watch it ! [ Alpha 5 ] Wait . What are you doing ? Just stop fighting , please ! What ? [ Trini ] That 's dope . What ? I got something on my f ... - [ Zack ] Yeah ! - [ Billy ] Whoa ! Okay , now that 's cool ! Oh , yeah ! - Hold still . - Don 't touch it . Zack , don 't touch it . Zack , do not touch it . [ all ] Whoa ! [ Zack ] Where 'd it go ? Bring it back . Bring it back , dude . [ Zordon ] Get out . Training is over for today . Go home . I 'm sorry , [ stammers ] he just morphed . He did it . You saw it , right ? [ Zordon ] Do it again . All of you . Any of you . - Billy . How 'd you do it , Billy ? - Come on , Billy , let 's do it . - [ Jason ] Show us what you did . - [ Zack ] Come on . Do it again . - Do it again ! - I 'm trying , I 'm trying ! I can 't focus ! Billy , how 'd you do it ? Show us . Okay , we don 't know how . [ Zordon ] That 's what I thought . If you can 't morph , you are not rangers . Go home . All of you . [ Jason ] Now what ? Damn . [ Kimberly ] Seriously ? [ sighs ] [ Zack ] Hey , guys ... guys , look , uh ... I 'ma stay up here tonight . Make a fire . I got some food if you guys wanna stay . I 'm down . All right . Cool . [ Zordon ] Jason 's team is failing . I shall destroy Rita myself . There must be a way to free me from this wall . Yes , but the irony is , is that you need these rangers to morph . If they morph , you can harness that energy to regenerate your body and come back through . [ groans ] There 's got to be another way ! I can 't ... [ Zack ] What , Zordon ? You can 't what ? Wait for us dumb kids to morph so that you can come back to life ? That 's what all this has been about , right ? You coming back ? This has only ever been about protecting the crystal . Rita could be building Goldar as we speak . - Don 't underestimate me or my team . - You can 't stop him . She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth will die . And we need you . Because you were so successful at stopping her last time . I died burying those coins in hopes that they would find the next real rangers . Those who are worthy . Well , sorry to disappoint you . I don 't need to stand here and have you tell me what I did wrong . - I can go home and get that . - Jason , you need me out of this wall . To help lead this team ! Your team 's dead . And you 're just as scared as we are . These ... are all 24 karat gold bands . - [ bell jingles ] - Hello , I 'll be right with you . They 're at the top of your budget ... [ man ] I 'll get you anything you want . [ chuckles ] Aw . You 're so sweet . [ man ] Get my cookie anything she wants . I 'll be right back . Uh ... can I help you ? Gold . I 'm interested ... in gold . Yeah . We have some very nice pieces here . - [ low rumbling ] - [ sighs contentedly ] Come closer . - Closer . Closer . Closer . - Oh ... [ gagging ] - This . Give it to me ! - Of course ! Okay . Here you go . - [ breathing heavily ] - [ murmuring nervously ] Ah ... Grow . Grow . More ! - [ door bell jingles ] - Police ! Don 't move ! Drop your ... weapon , and put your hands on your head . Do it now ! Do what I say , lady ! Lady ... I like the sound of " lady . " [ officer ] Get on the ground and you won 't get hurt . [ cackles ] [ inhales deeply ] Unit five , I need backup at Fenix Jewelers . Shots fired . I repeat , shots fired . Get down ! - [ rifle fires ] - [ people screaming ] It 's been too long since I raised my beautiful creatures . Did you miss me ? [ Putty snarling ] Oh , my God . - [ Rita ] Kill him ! - [ Putty growling ] - [ Zack ] All right . - [ Power Rangers laughing ] If I weren 't stuck in this wall , [ imitates Zordon ] I would eat that junk food ! What happened back there ? Nothing . Don 't worry about it . Billy , how 'd you do it ? How 'd you morph ? I don 't know . What are you guys thinking about when we 're trying to morph ? [ imitates Zordon ] You must shed your masks to wear this armor . [ all chuckle ] [ imitates Zordon ] Think only of each other and the morphing grid will open to you . Yeah , that 's better . Well , maybe it 's because we don 't know each other . Maybe that 's why we can 't morph . [ Kimberly ] Okay . No , I 'm serious . Let 's do this . For real . - [ mouths ] What ? - I 'm Zack . And I am a Power Ranger . [ all laughing ] [ all ] Hi , Zack . Truth : I live in the Melody Mobile Home Park . It 's just me and my mom . And my mom ? [ echoing ] My mom is the best ! But my mom , she 's sick . I do what I can , but ... but I 'm scared . Sometimes I get too scared to stay there at night , ' cause ... 'cause I 'm afraid she can 't make it . And if she goes ... when she goes , I got nobody else . Look , [ chuckles ] I think being with you guys is good for me . Let 's do that . Let 's tell our secrets . It 'll ... it 'll help us . Okay , I got a secret . - I like country music . - [ chuckles ] What ? No , matter of fact , I love country music . [ all laughing ] And I don 't ... I don 't miss my dad as much . I mean , coming to the mine with him was all I had . But coming to the mine with you guys is just as good . Yeah . Bigger secret is why were you in detention ? - I blew up my lunchbox . - What ? - What , it was a accident , okay ? - [ all laughing ] - Of course . - [ Billy ] My lunchbox was in my locker . Boom goes the lunchbox , in detention goes Billy . But let 's not forget that Kimberly Hart was also in ... in detention , too , so ... Not tonight . Skip me . What about you , dude ? Why don 't you tell us who you really are ? Because everyone knows exactly who I am . Okay . What about you , crazy girl ? I could tell you anything and you 'd have to believe me . Okay , um ... I 'm the new girl . Always . Three schools in three years . What 's crazy is I like it that way . You know , it 's just easier . Nobody ever has to get to know me and uh , my parents don 't have to worry about my relationships . [ Zack ] Boyfriend troubles ? Yeah . Boyfriend troubles . Girlfriend troubles ? My family is so normal . Too normal . They believe in labels . They 'd like for me to , um ... dress differently . Talk more . Have the kind of friends they want me to have . It 's just ... I don 't know how to tell them what 's really going on with me . [ inhales sharply ] And I 've never said any of this out loud . Well , it 's cool . You 're with us now . Am I ? What does that mean ? When all this is over . Are we Power Rangers or ... are we friends ? [ Trini gasps ] - [ gasps ] - [ Rita ] Do you know who I am ? [ breathes shakily ] Yes . I was once just like you . So pretty . Innocent Are all the rangers on Zordon 's new team as young as you ? - [ grunts ] - [ Rita yells ] Delightful ! [ Trini yelps ] Have you morphed yet ? Trick question . If you could morph , we 'd be having a very different conversation . [ sniffs ] Mmm . The Yellow Ranger . [ laughs mockingly ] Should I kill you ? I killed the Yellow Ranger ... before . And I loved it ! Oh , you want your armor . I 'll show you mine , if you show me yours . [ breathing raggedly ] [ Trini grunts ] No , please , you 're hurting me ! You 're so strong ! [ chuckling ] I 'm just kidding . You 've got spunk , little Yellow . I see myself in you . I was an outsider on Zordon 's team just like you . All I need to know is , where is the Zeo Crystal ? [ gasping ] I don 't know . Sadly , I believe you . Tomorrow , I am going to destroy Angel Grove . But , in exchange for your life , you will find out where that crystal is , and you will come to me . We can have a little deal , Didi , my friend . [ Trini groaning ] - Shh ! It 's me . - [ muffled ] Kim . How did you get in here ? I 'm a superhero . And you left your window open . Is everything okay ? I think I 'm the reason we can 't morph . I haven 't really been honest . Okay . I punched Ty Fleming in the face because he told everyone I was the meanest person he 'd ever met . And he was right . Well , that can 't be true . Okay . Whoa . - You took that picture ? - No . Amanda Clark took that picture . Of herself . But she shared it with me . Privately . She trusted me . And you sent that pic to ... to Ty ? With a text that said , " Is this the girl you wanna bring home to your mom ? " Oh . I didn 't realize how mean it was until I saw her face . Kim , there 's literally thousands of photos going around school . I don 't care about them . I care about this . I did this . I had to sit in Mr. Detmer 's office with Amanda 's father and watch as they showed him that photo of his daughter . In his eyes , for the first time , I could see who I 'd become . You know , so I lied . I blamed everyone else . I wanted to die , that 's why ... that 's why when you asked me to run away , I was ready . Okay , listen . Start over . Erase that picture right now . - Jason , it can 't be erased . - Then live with it . You did an awful thing . It doesn 't make you an awful person . Just be the person you wanna be . [ cell phone chimes ] [ Kimberly ] So , we all got the same text . So where is she ? I 'm here . Look , Rita came to my house tonight . - What ? - Yeah . She 's real ... - insane . - [ Kimberly gasps ] She nearly killed me . She was trying to get me to join her . She said she 'd spare my life , if I could keep a secret . What secret ? At dawn , the destruction of Angel Grove begins . This is real . This is the end . No , it 's not . Where is she ? She said to meet her where the dead ships live . Okay . That 's the boatyard by the docks , right ? - Let 's go . - [ Kimberly ] What ? [ scoffs ] Are you serious ? No one ? Jason , we 're not even Power Rangers yet . I say we go back to Zordon . Okay , the only reason Zordon wanted us to become Power Rangers is so that he can come back to life . What makes you say that ? Because he told me . Wait , so this all is a lie ? Of course it was a lie , Billy . We failed . Let 's stop being delusional about being a team of superheroes . We 're all screw-ups . And as much as I hate this scrubby , bullshit town , I don 't wanna just sit around and watch it die , okay ? Let 's go and do the one thing that 's been asked of us and kill Rita . [ gasps ] You know this is a really bad idea , right ? The worst . Let 's vote . Show of hands . Let 's do it . [ Jason whispering ] Okay . Okay , let 's go . [ rock music playing ] [ whispers ] Take the left , I 'll take the right . Okay . Got it . [ all yelling ] [ all gasp ] [ muffled whimpering ] - We 'll , untie him . Hold this . - No , no , no . Let 's just think about this , okay ? Oh , shit ! [ yells ] Right on time . I was beginning to think you were too dumb to know where the dead ships live . Let 's play . - [ Rita yelling ] - [ Power Rangers groaning ] [ groans ] Five little rangers tied up like fish . The leader ? Oh , hello , Red . - [ grunts ] - Oh ! [ chuckles ] You 're not entirely disappointing . Oh , look at you . Trying to figure out my plan . I 'll just tell you . Yellow has led you to your deaths . - [ struggling ] - Because I 'm going to kill you , one by one , until you tell me , where is my crystal ? We don 't know . No , Red . You don 't know ! But guess what ? One of you does . Who could it be ? Eenie , meenie , miney ... Blue . Blue , so loyal . Pure of heart . Tell the class what you know ! - Where 's my crystal ? - [ struggling ] You can tell me now , Blue , or you can tell me after I kill all of your friends . - Let 's start with Black . - [ groans ] - [ gasping ] - [ Jason ] No ! Stop ! No . He dies in three , two ... Okay ! Okay ! [ gasping ] Don 't hurt my friends , all right ? It 's at a dining establishment . Where ? What does that mean ? What 's it called ? It 's a Krispy Kreme . - Krispy Kreme ? - Krispy Kreme . This is a special place ? - Very special . - It must be . The source of life itself is buried there . Thank you , Blue , for being so weak . Zordon would lose all respect for me if I don 't kill you . - At least one of you . - [ Kimberly ] What ? [ Jason ] No ! Billy ! [ all screaming ] - Billy ! - Billy ! - Jason , we gotta help him ! - Billy ! Billy ! [ Rita ] You 're not ready to kill me . Ha ! You 're not worthy . [ Kimberly ] Quick ! Get the rope ! [ all grunting ] [ Zack ] Billy ! [ Kimberly grunts ] Billy ? He 's gonna be okay , right ? Come on . Hey , hey . You got this , big guy . Come on . [ Crying ] He 's dead . He 's dead . No . [ sobbing ] Pick him up . Help me pick him up ! Come on ! [ melancholy music playing ] Okay . Okay . Come on , Billy . We got you , buddy . Take him . Take him . Yeah . - Let 's just put him down . - Okay . - [ Trini ] Slow , slow , slow . - Master Billy . Do something , okay ? There must be something you can do for him . I told you that you were not ready . Zordon , please help us , okay ? Please . There 's nothing that I could do for him . We were both reckless with our teams . [ sighs ] No . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , guys . He 's dead because of me . No , Jason , it was all of us . No , I pushed it . And as usual I made the wrong decision . [ stammers ] Out of ... out of fear , anger ... I don 't know , I was just so angry . He 's ... he 's a great kid , you know ? And he loved us . He loved ... being a ranger . I 'm sorry , Billy . I 'd trade my life for yours if I could . Maybe he traded his life for us . [ Zack ] Yeah . Probably did . I would . Me too . Yeah . Me too . Me too . It 's just the four of us now . The truth is , whatever we 've said to each other , it doesn 't matter . This . This is the only thing that matters . [ sniffles ] She 's right . [ Alpha 5 ] Zordon ! Zordon ! Look at the grid ! This is your time ! Do ... do you see it ? The grid is open ! Step through ! Yes , I see it . I see it . Step through , Zordon ! - Hey ! - What 's happening ? [ Alpha 5 ] The morphing grid is open ! - What 's going on ? - [ Zordon screaming ] Zordon ? Master ? Where is he ? [ Alpha 5 ] He must have stepped through the grid . [ Trini ] Alpha , where 'd he go ? I don 't know where he is . Zordon , what ? Why didn 't you step though ? That was your only chance . I know . But only one can come back . [ coughs ] - [ gasps ] - [ Alpha 5 ] Billy ! - Billy ! - Oh , my God ! Hey ! Are you okay ? - Did I die ? - Yes . - No . - Little bit . And you guys brought me back to life . I told you we were superheroes . There can only be one Red Ranger . Jason , this is your time . This is your team . Thank you . - [ Zack chuckles ] - [ Billy ] Dude . That was loopy . Seein ' my dad . [ Zack laughs ] [ exhales ] Welcome back , my friend . - Oh , we gotta go to Krispy Kreme , Jason . - What ? Not for donuts . Okay . Let 's try this . Thank you , Zordon . It 's morphin ' time . [ whistles ] Who is that ? Oh , my God ! [ Rita ] Yes . Come back to me , Goldar . Come back . Hold up . Look . [ Putties snarling ] [ Pink Ranger ] All right . Let 's do this . [ Power Rangers grunting ] [ all grunt ] [ Putties snarling ] [ Power Rangers grunting ] Yes ! Yee-haw ! Whoa , this is so much better with armor . [ laughs joyfully ] [ Yellow Ranger ] Come on ! Bring it on ! Hey , heads up ! [ Red Ranger ] Guys , they just keep coming . [ Blue Ranger ] There 's too many of them . [ Black Ranger ] You guys hold them off . [ Pink Ranger ] Zack , where are you going ? Whoo-hoo ! [ Rita ] Make my monster grow ! [ cackling ] I 've missed you , my friend . [ roaring ] [ Power Rangers grunting ] [ Pink Ranger ] They 're gonna push us off the edge ! [ Black Ranger ] Incoming ! [ Black Ranger whoops ] - Let 's kill everyone . - [ Goldar snarling ] [ Black Ranger ] Did you guys see that ? [ all laugh ] All right , who wants me to pimp their ride , too ? [ chattering excitedly ] Uh , guys ? We 're too late . [ Black Ranger ] Oh , man . That 's ... that 's a lotta gold . [ Yellow Ranger ] We 're gonna protect the crystal , right ? - We 're going to Angel Grove . - Let 's get the Zords . This is a lot different than the van . [ laughs ] Whoo ! Yippie-kay-yay , motherfu ... Mother 's good . Mother 's good . Go , go , Power Rangers ! [ Power Rangers theme playing ] [ Blue Ranger ] I 'm not going the right way ! What ? Jason , I 'm going backwards . Guys ... our town . She 's destroying it . - Krispy Kreme ! - [ people screaming ] Not there . Rita and her golden boy haven 't found Krispy Kreme yet . [ Red Ranger ] Okay , Kim , you hold them there . Zack , Billy , you circle the Krispy Kreme and make sure it 's safe . I 'm headed straight for Goldar . [ Pink Ranger ] Copy ! I 'll hold her off . Kim , I 'll go with you . [ Red Ranger ] Let 's go , boys . [ Black Ranger ] Billy , just the two of us . I 'm right behind you . Oops . Surprise . [ pop music playing ] How cute . The rangers found their costumes and their dino-cars . Well , let 's give them something else to play with . [ growls ] Crush them ! [ Putties growling ] How many does she need ? This is insane .

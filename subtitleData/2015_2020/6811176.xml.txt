Rosewood , bones and Lucifer . - What 's your name ? - Lucifer . Like the devil ? Only on fox . Previously on " second chance " ... Disgraced sheriff Jimmy Pritchard took his own life today . You 're the first to journey all the way back . To get another chance . I know you . You 're one of those ... Rich computer twits . Otto re-coded your white blood cells to fight the cancer in my blood . You brought me back to save you . The donor grows much stronger than any of my models anticipated . You really knew my grandfather ? There is no way that Jimmy Pritchard killed himself . What is your connection to my father ? ! Who the hell are you ? I 'm sheriff Jimmy Pritchard . You have 12 hours before you need to be back in the tank . Set the timer on the phone for you . You worried about who you brought back ? Should I be ? Gracie , step away from him . What are you gonna do , Duval ? Shoot your own brother ? I 'm family . You think my son 's just gonna walk away ? Is that it ? Not even gonna leave a $ 20 on my nightstand ? I 'm sorry . Thank you for , uh ... My blood ? Yes . Not at all . Thanks for bringing me back from the dead . I 'm not handling this well . I didn 't consider the , um , intimacy of the situation . So you felt something , too ? No . No . It 's just that ... I don 't even know you , and now we 're ... Exchanging body fluids . Yes . It 's just that you are a , uh ... A certain kind of man . And I live a certain kind of life ... One that has not been full of surprises . Surprise ! So you 'll understand if I need a moment to , um ... Adjust . I 'll be right here . I don 't understand . Is the DNA sample a match or not ? From what I got off the glass you gave me , there are enough points of commonality for it to meet the criteria for a familial match , but the rest of it seems almost transgenic . I 'm sorry , trans ... ? Genic . Yeah , like , the way you would modify corn against insects or cows to give more protein-rich milk . But the sample came from a man , so ... Something 's either funky with my machine or real funky with that DNA . Can you get me another sample ? Yeah , but the match . You sure ? Yeah . He is family . Thanks . Match to what ? You know , if that 's a dating service , you should try badge bunnies . They love guys with guns . I gave the FBI lab a DNA sample of the guy who says he 's our half-brother . Came back a positive familial match . Really ? Mm-hmm . Like , for sure positive ? That 's right . You can 't date him . We 're all pretty bummed about it . Background check has him serving overseas for the last 15 years , but he is lying about something . I 've got calls in to the units he was in . Or you could invite him over for dinner and just ask him . Did you run my prints when they brought me home from the hospital ? I had an idea where you came from . So dad had another woman . Is that such a shock ? No . I mean , we might have enough siblings out there for a baseball team . The big question is why would he want to join this family ? I mean , I 've been looking to get out since I was 13 . That 's exactly the question . The guy shows up out of nowhere , and he knows all about me . The way he looks at me , he 's working something . I need more answers . And I think I know where I can get them . Can I help you ? I 'm looking for the mustard . That 's not what that means . When I say , " can I help you ? " I mean you have to help me understand who you are and why you 're here before I call security . I said I 'm looking for the mustard . But the yellow kind , no , not this ... This stuff with seeds in it . Who puts seeds in mustard ? Those are mustard seeds . That 's what you make mustard out of . No , mustard is yellow . You know , you go to the ball park . You put it on a hot dog . Yellow . I don 't need to be learning new things at my ... Age . I 'm calling security . Relax . I 'm a friend of Mary 's . Oh , are you ? And where exactly on the Venn diagram of Ms. Goodwin 's life does your circle overlap with hers ? The Venn ... ? Corporate ? Academic ? Charitable ? I 'm quite intimate with all of her circles , and I don 't remember you being in any of them . I 'm just curious . When you were a little girl , did you ever think you 'd be the kind of person that grew up to say you 're intimate with another person 's circle ? I 'm calling security . It 's okay , Alexa . I see you 've met my guest . Oh ... Yes . So sorry . I am here because I brought you the research reports for the conference call that you have later . And I did that . So now I can go . And it was so nice to meet you . And you have that , and I 'm going . So ... Bye . She thinks we 're having sex . Yes , I got that . I 'll talk to her . And tell her what ... The truth ? A version of it . Good morning , sheriff Pritchard . You asked me to alert you to crimes that met your specific criteria . I 'm sorry . You did what ? Just ones that need my particular skills . Oh . There are crimes to be solved involving drinking and arrogance ? This is unfolding currently . We have to warn you ... Some of these images are very disturbing . You can 't see in these pictures , but the letters " f , " " d , " and " s " were carved into the foreheads of the victims . Police and the FBI are trying to determine if these letters match any known terror groups . We 're hoping that surveillance footage of the scene will help to identify the killer or killers , although that footage still has not been recovered at this time . Pause . Enhance . That 's the criteria you gave Arthur to search for ... FBI cases your son is working ? Did I ? We 're doing everything we can . We 're cooperating ... Turn that guy up . To the families of the victims of this tragedy . The right to peacefully protest is fundamental to our nation , and we are cooperating fully with the FBI to find whoever did this . That 's who has your missing footage ... that guy . Those people are dead . Yeah . Good eye . You really think Duke Davis had something to do with an axe murder ? No , I 'm suggesting that he took the video footage to cover up whoever he had do it . I knew this guy back when he was starting up . The union tried to squeeze him out of a contract . He had the organizer dumped in the bay . What do you mean , " dumped in the bay ? " I mean he was alive and then he wasn 't and he was dumped in the bay . And guess what , security footage was missing . So now you think he needs a visit from the sheriff . Damn right he does . No . Mary , can we sedate him now ? No , it 's okay . I 'm just gonna talk to the guy . Duke doesn 't know you . You 'll never get past his security . But he does know me . Mary , no ! I can offer Lookinglass ' help to update his security . If I get access to Duke 's systems , you can search for the missing footage . And since I know you won 't stay here even if you promise to , you can come , but I will do the talking . Just talking . It 's okay , kid . I won 't let her get in any danger . That security footage is electronic . It can 't be erased unless someone inside Davis northwest wanted it to be . Get a warrant to search the offices and find out what those letters mean . While you 're doing that , I 'm gonna take a few minutes personal time . Hey , Otto , we got a fed at the curb . Why are you talking like that ? Mr. Pritchard has been helping me with my vernacular phrasing . Don 't listen to him . Ever . And show me who 's at the gate , please . My sister isn 't here . Goodbye . I know . I want to talk with you . Arthur , run the possible scenarios if I let him in . Analyzing all the variables , including your social skills and what he might find in this house , the probability of you ending up in prison is 62 % . Go away . I know you 're a genius , so maybe you can help me understand why the guy your sister is with has DNA with a , uh , what do you call it , um , transgenic mutation ? Why is he saying those words ? Those are our words . Read his facial expression . What does he know ? For that data , you will need to engage him in conversation . Keep your hands up ! How are you , Duke ? Hey , Mary . Sorry I couldn 't , uh , meet at the office . My people don 't want me out after what happened today . Terrible thing . Brutal . Yes . And to get right to it , your company is built on an old-school model without the digital infrastructure needed to identify future threats . Case in point , the unfortunate loss of the surveillance footage . I want to personally put all the reach and resources of Lookinglass at your disposal to help in any way we can . That 's very ... Very generous of you . Mr. Pritchard here is my head of security , and he can coordinate our resources with yours to track down any leads to who did this . I think you 'll be amazed at what we can do . Thanks for the offer . If I need the help , I 'll be in touch . Unless you 're not that anxious to find who did it . Can 't be an easy time for coal energy ... Legislation , protestors . Anything that discourages trouble might not be so unwelcome . Always good to see you , Mary . You mind if I give it a try ? It looks fun . That is , if you 're done beating up your kid . That is your kid that you 're beating up , right ? James . I won 't hurt him . Just keep him busy long enough for you to look around . See if you can find something . Okay if we sit ? Yes , just not in my chair . Which is your chair ? All of them . What can you tell me about transgenic mutation ? You 're the one who said those words when you were standing outside . Yeah , but it involves Pritchard , right ? What can you tell me about him ? About Jimmy Pritchard ? Nothing . A guy in your position doesn 't usually surround himself with people he doesn 't know . I don 't surround myself with any people . You and your sister are very close . You mean to tell me you don 't know anything about the guy she 's out with right now ? I didn 't say I didn 't know anything . I said I couldn 't tell you anything . Where did you learn to box ? Army . Saigon . Wait , no , not Saigon . Fallujah . I was in Fallujah . Come on . Hit me . You know , Mary 's right . No one stands to make more out of this mess than you do . You think I benefit from having my name associated with this butchery ? It 's been associated with worse . Do I know you ? Oh , I know you . I know how you beat the unions in ' 85 . Oh ! Pritchard ! I remember a Pritchard . Drunk ex-sheriff who killed himself in disgrace . I see a resemblance . Mary , Otto has let an FBI agent in the house . It is not going well . The agent has begun to touch things . You know , I read that you have issues you deal with ... The need for order and predictability . This Pritchard ... I 'll bet ... I 'll bet he 's not predictable at all , is he ? I 'd rather you not touch that . Oh . You haven 't had dirt under your nails in years , have you , Duke ? But you know who did . Why is this any of your business ? What happened to those people ? Someone 's gonna pay for that . Ohh ! Ohh ! Stop ! We 're done here . Good round . I was close . He was gonna talk . He was not going to talk , and you were going to hit him . We 'll get him another way . We 'll get him ? Look at you . Wait ! Dude . You just owned my dad . Totally punked him . It was awesome . No one does that . Thank you . Wow . Even the kid wants to bring him down . Let me go talk to him . No . We have to get back to Otto now . He let Duval into the house . Those glasses work both ways ? How long have you known him , Otto ? You have to talk to Mary . Mary talks to people . I do not talk to people . I-i think you should go . When did you first meet him ? You have to talk to Mary ! Just tell me when he showed up ! December 5 , 2015 . Now go ! Do you know what that day is ? Leave the kid alone , Duval . Gonna ask anybody anything , ask me . And what will that get me ... More lies ? Tell him you have information about the case . I saw something that ties Duke to the crime . I , uh ... I have a line on who hacked up the protestors . Meet me at 1081 Woodlawn Avenue ... In the back . What do I know ? What the letters carved on the victims ' foreheads mean . Wow , I 'm very smart . Asher ! Asher , can you hear me ? I know what those letters are . I had the video brought to me because I was afraid . For god 's sakes , Asher . Please tell me this isn 't you . Sorry . I wish I could . Now be a good father and clean it up for me . Interesting spot to meet . I picked somewhere I knew we 'd never run into anyone . I 've been meaning to come down here and pay my respects . We 're not here to pay our respects to him , are we ? No . We 're here because I want the truth ... About you . About him . And why you showed up at Lookinglass the same day our dad died ... That day right there . I needed Mary Goodwin 's help . How did you know her ? Met her at a conference . I was in private security after my last tour in Fallujah ... That 's where I was . We just kind of hit it off . You and Mary Goodwin . Yeah . Even had a thing for a while . You and Mary Goodwin ? Yes , and I don 't appreciate your tone . When I heard about dad , I didn 't believe for a second that he 'd killed himself . And frankly , Duval , I 'm disappointed that you did . Why ? I expected that call every day for 15 years . Because the Jimmy Pritchard I knew was no quitter . So I asked Mary if I could use her company to help find out what really happened . And you did . So why are you here ? 'Cause dad asked me to keep an eye on you . I 've got information on these killings . Do you want it or not ? Yeah , I do . What do you have ? Duke Davis went to this fancy prep school . The motto was de tenebris phoebus . And that 's the initials carved on the victims ' foreheads . Except the letters weren 't " d , " " t , " and " p . " They were " f , " " d , " and " s . " When you translate it into English , it means , " from darkness , the sun " ... " f , " " d , " " s . " You know Latin ? You don 't think I could know Latin ? Say something in Latin . Go on . Somebody ... Yeah . Wants us to look at Duke Davis and his old school , so ... All right . I 'll check the names of his classmates when he was there , see if anything happened . It should take a day . Paperwork will take a day . I 've got a quicker way . Everybody that went to highland hall with Duke , everybody that 's been there since then , where they are now , and what they 're doing . So the information I gave you helped ? Can we get him ? She gave you the clue ? It was a collaboration . Is that FBI agent Pritchard ? Ms. Goodwin . Agent Pritchard , some of the information I may or may not have on hand may or may not have been obtained legally . Do you still want to hear it ? He 's nodding " yes , " Mary . Do you want to catch Duke or not ? So , yeah , it 's all done with , uh ... Computers . Yeah . That was my guess . Narrow down the search . Anything bad or newsworthy happen when Duke was at highland hall ? No . Nothing comes up . Oh . But some things did happen when his son was there . That 's the kid . My ... my fan . " Dormitory burns down in fire . " First thought to be arson , later ruled accidental . Looks like Asher Davis left school after that . And Duke Davis' only connection then is a large donation made to help rebuild the dorm . In exchange for making the charges disappear , I bet . Maybe so . Follow Asher . " Please . " Please . Where 'd he go next ? One year at holy trinity preparatory academy . But he left there , too , after being suspended . Any dorms burn down ? No , but a lacrosse player was put in a coma after an attack . No charges . Where 'd he go next ? Ecole Mont-Leclair in Geneva and then two colleges in the northwest . Coinciding with an attempted assault ... No charges , rape ... No charges filed . Duke just keeps moving him around , making the charges disappear . And now to make surveillance footage disappear . This kid 's gone from burning down dorms to axe-murdering . He 's escalating fast . I think he 's trying to get his dad 's attention . " Out of darkness , the sun . " It is a message ... For Duke . It 's a pun . " Out of darkness ... The son . " Alexa ! No , if this is about that man this morning , no need to explain , but I do have to tell you I am so happy for you . You work so hard , and you take care of your brother . And if you want to enjoy the pleasures of a man , even one who doesn 't offer any intellectual challenge at all ... Alexa . No . He 's just a donor . A donor ? You 're gonna have a baby ? Oh , I 'm so happy for you . You are going to make the best mom ... no . Blood . Blood ! Blood donor . For me . An experimental cancer treatment . We put him up at the house so news doesn 't get out . I should have told you . It 's already working . There is a light in you , and I can see it . I didn 't tell you to be here . Why ... why are you here ? I know these people . I know how they work . Been picking up after them for long enough . And you know them from where ? Dad told me stuff . I am inclined to believe almost none of that , but the truth here is FBI ... Not FBI . So everyone here who 's not FBI should take a nice walk . Feed the ducks . Dad , I think that FBI agent is here to talk to you about those dead protestors chained to your fence . Why do you say that ? Oh , you know , they hated coal . My dad hated them . Now they 're dead . Close your mouth , Asher . I mean , it 's all over the news . Do you watch the news ? I don 't , but I hear old people do . Shut your mouth ! I 'm not here to talk to your father , Asher . I 've got a few questions for you . Just need to cover the bases . If you don 't mind , I 'd like to know where you were during the hours before and after those killings . Let me see . Let me see . Let me see . I know I was somewhere ... With someone . Well , now you 're here with me . So where were you , Asher ? I have thought about it ... As a dad , what would I do if , god forbid , Gracie got in serious trouble ? It 's not easy . I get it . But this guy ... this ... This Duke Davis ... Didn 't go well ? He made it clear that if I wanted to talk to Asher again , I 'd have to wade through his lawyers . And the kid ? Alibi . He said he was with the cart girl . Maybe let me take care of this one . Again , FBI ... not FBI . She 's just gonna blow smoke up your ass . Then lying to a federal agent is one more thing I 'll get her for . You take me to the nicest places . You . You don 't belong here . Yeah , I 've been feeling that a lot lately . What are you doing here , Bobbi ? Huh ? Something for Asher ? You don 't know anything about Asher . I know he 's a prince , and you 're a cart girl . I 've seen this movie . It doesn 't end well for the cart girl . What are you doing for Asher ? Ah , well , if it isn 't Mary Goodwin 's head of security . That 's what you are , isn 't it ? That 's what you 're wearing ? Okay , well , don 't just stand there . Let 's go down . Man , that really pissed my dad off when you took him down in the ring . Yeah , you liked that , didn 't you ? Look at you trying to get all up in my head . Oh , don 't worry about her . Right now you got a choice to make ... red or blue ? Hey , I know you want to talk to me tonight , but party 's over if you don 't swallow . You first . I 'd put your seat back and tray table up if I were you . Ahh . Did you come here to save me from the evil prince ? Do you want me to save you ? Hey , do you want her , man ? What ? It 's cool . She 's the cart girl . Everybody wants the cart girl . Asher , cut it out ! You ass ! Does your dad beat on you a lot in the ring ? Yeah , it makes him feel big . Whatever . You know , if you want , I could maybe teach you a few moves , get inside that right cross . Yeah . No , I don 't think I need that . Hey , this pill makes me want to tell secrets . You want to hear a secret ? I know you 're here for me , and I 'm ready , okay ? I 'm ready for it . You should see your face right now , dude ! You 're so wasted . Yeah , he 's definitely my dad 's son . I recorded the whole thing . Okay , well , you 're just gonna have to trust me . He brought it up . He wants to get caught . He called me out . Oh . Hi . You okay ? You look a little bit like grandpa . What ? No , I mean , the way that he used to look . You know , sometimes , in the morning . Why ... why don 't you just be a good girl , huh , and make me that , uh , famous hangover cure ? It was just one time . Gracie , Gracie , Gracie . Don 't do drugs . Understand ? But dad brings me all the good stuff from the evidence locker . Hey . Not funny . The designer drugs kids do these days ... In my day , all you needed was a little Mary Jane and some whiskey , and you were set . Your day ? Oh , I got to run . All right , so , to recap , you spent a night of illegal behavior with our murder suspect , had him drop you off on the investigating FBI agent 's lawn ... And got no information . Yeah . That 's great . No . Wait . I-i-i forgot . I got this from the cart girl . You stole that from our cart girl . She 's his favorite toy . I don 't think he 'd go anywhere without her . Where 's he going ? You 're the FBI agent . You find the clue . Gracie ... I got to go , okay ? Sorry . See ya . Her dog . She put her dog in the kennel . She kenneled her dog . Why would anyone kennel their dog ? Just go ahead and say it . They kennel their dog because they 're leaving town . Or in this case , fleeing . Yes . Good work with the wallet . Maybe next time you can get some legally obtained evidence so that I have something , you know , to put in the report . Life is not reports . More like him every day . He knew how to tail someone . You lose her , we get nothing . So I won 't lose her . Really ? Driving like this ? You ever tailed anyone before ? Never . This is very exciting . It 's my first tail . I guess Duke Davis ' jet ? Taking the kid and the girl out of the country ? He 's still covering his kid 's tracks . I 'll call for backup . You stay put . Duke ? Duke ? Where 's your kid ? Are you a father ? Yeah , I am . Huh . He was such a tiny baby . Weighed almost nothing . My hand covered his whole back . He was always in trouble . Just boy stuff . His mother saw . I just thought rambunctious . Then came the business at highland hall . Then he did it again . And the company ... Oh , that kind of publicity is gonna hurt all of us ... Family , friends . What was I supposed to do ... Destroy everything just because I couldn 't handle my kid ? So many . At some point , I ... I was in too deep . No one would understand . Not if they weren 't a father . Oh , Duke . Officer with a 10-33 , med response at the airfield off Cole Avenue . A stab wound , loss of blood . But this ... This last thing ... With the axe ... that was enough . But you were taking him out of the country , letting him get away with it again . He thought so . He didn 't want to go . But he ... he wasn 't ... He wasn 't getting away with it . None of us were . I only put in enough fuel to get us an hour ... Over the ocean . You have kids ? Did I ask you that already ? You want me , kid ? Here I am . Aah ! Sweet , stupid Bobbi . I saw you do the math on that little cart girl . I knew you 'd follow her . Follow her sad , little car . Putt , putt , putt . Why 'd you kill your dad , Asher ? Oh , he couldn 't stop me . He was weak . You wanted him to stop you . I wanted him to try . If you wanted your daddy 's attention , you should have gotten a piercing like a normal kid . I didn 't want his attention . I wanted him to be a man , like you ... Like us . I know you understand what being a man is . I saw it . And now you want me to stop you . Is that it ? To try . That way , when you 're dead , I 'll be the strongest . You know what , I 've been dead . It 's not for me . Aah ! Ohh ! Drop it ! I told you to watch the right cross . Where 's the girl ? She doubled back . Her car 's gone . Did you set up a perimeter ? You mean have I done this before ? Yeah . Now I 'm gonna cuff him 'cause he 's a bad guy . Leave him alone ! Ohh . Ohh . On your knees ! Get down now ! Hands behind your back ! Asher . Is Asher okay ? Is Asher okay ? Oh , god . Now what the hell did you do ? I got shot . What 's it look like ? All right . You hang on . The ambulance is coming , okay ? No . No ambulance . Yes ! Yes . Yes . That 's shock from the loss of all that blood . You hang on , all right ? You hang on ! Now I 'm gonna get you to the hospital . No , I just took a bullet for you . So you just listen to me , all right ? Just once in your life , just listen to me . Take me to Mary Goodwin 's . This is agent Pritchard . You 'll find Duke Davis dead in his plane . He was killed by his son , who 's in an ambulance . An accomplice is cuffed and in a hangar . I 'll make the report after I pursue another lead . Why the Goodwin house ? Why does it always take us back there ? And I want the truth this time . I always told you the truth . I just told you what you needed to know . You didn 't need to know everything . You were just a boy . You were just a boy . I should have gone to your ball games . I should have ... I should have been better to your mom . A child 's father is supposed to ... Protect him from the bad things , not be the bad things . Sorry , Duval . I was just ... I was just trying to protect you . What the hell are you talking about ? James ? This is FBI agent Pritchard . He 's dying . He begged me to take him back to you . He said you could fix him . Can you do that ? What 's wrong with him ? Multiple gunshot wounds , cuts , massive blood loss . I 'll meet you at the gate . No , we 're coming in together or I take him to the hospital . No more lies . This is not good at all . I realize that , Otto . To compromise the security of the operation is to put us at risk , but to refuse will put you at risk . I understand that , Otto . Let me think . What the hell is he ? Not " what . " " Who . " He 's James Pritchard . You know that . He was saying things in the car ... Going to ball games , like he thinks he 's my father . He said he was sorry . Why did he say that ? Why did he say he was sorry ? Why does he think he 's my father ? Because he is .

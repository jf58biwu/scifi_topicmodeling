 Previously on Continuum . What exactly are you building ? This mission is a need-to-know basis , you don 't need to know . Alec ? I hope you 're getting this . I am , but what am I getting ? I can 't let you go . But I 'm your Achilles Heel . I want you to track Kiera 's CMR . Keep me updated on her movements . He 's the one you told me about . The original freelancer . Who travelled back 1000 years to start a cult . [ Gun shot ] [ Gunfire ] [ Screams ] Don 't you see ? We could all go home . Lucas died trying to prevent that shitty future ! You 're spitting in his face wanting to preserve it . ♪ [ bottles clinking ] [ laughing and conversations ] Hey . Is this a bad time ? Yeah , of course it 's a bad time . I should just leave you alone . You 're all alone . Well , that 's how you work best . Single-minded , clear . I remember . Not me . You remember him . Him ? You . We 're not the same guy . And I don 't like being alone . Not anymore . She wasn 't the answer . What ? Emily ... you weren 't meant to be with Emily . Better she 's gone . I changed time to be with her . I love her . I wanted to tell you before . Emily is ... not my mother . I wanted to tell you , but you seemed so happy I didn 't want to wreck that . What did you say to her ? She asked . I told - You drove her away ? No , no . I freed her . Dad , really , it 's for the best . You have no right to decide what 's best for me ! It 's my choice , my life ! But I wanted to save you from making a mistake . Don 't you get it ? I 'm not going to become him . No dark future , no twisted legacy , no son . I 'm not your father , Jason . He 's an old man in another timeline who left you behind . Maybe that 's for the best . ♪ ♪ Every star in the universe burns out eventually . Darkness always conquers light . Lucas didn 't believe that . He fought and died for something better . Now he 's counting on us . Yeah , but when you first got here , Lucas was part of that darkness . Now you 're eulogizing him like he was righteous . He changed . Did he ? Or is it just your perception of him that changed ? You killed Lucas ! I had no choice ! You had a choice ! You made it for me ! I told you to stay away . Lucas never would have been there except for you ! Don 't you dare make it my fault . Then who 's fault is it ? I was trying to save someone . Yeah , Marcellus . You ! I was trying to save you ! If Lucas had been captured they would have tortured him , my cover would have been blown and you 'd be back on that hit list . I protected us . Now Zorin 's in charge I 'm still not considered need-to-know and they 're questioning my ability to control you . Lucas 's murder didn 't buy you any goodwill ? Where does this leave us ? I guess that depends on whether you still believe we want the same thing . The machine they 're building . What is it ? You want goodwill , let 's start there . It uses the same technology as the power suits . I don 't know what it 's for but I 'm working on it . Now , do you have that tech you stole from us ? I don 't have it . Kiera , if I don 't recover that , Zorin is never going to trust me . I need that key ! Key ? What ? You said key . What is it a key to ? Give it back to me and I 'll find out . And when you do , use this burner . I 'll contact you when I have something . It 's not easy to believe in you . Kiera , I am trying to keep you alive . Help me do that . Stay away . What was stolen ? One quantum computer . Value : $ 10 million . This mad scientist shit screams time-travelers . The question is : what do they need it for ? No idea . You talk to Brad ? He warned me to keep my distance . Let him work from the inside . [ Scoffs ] Really ? I want this resolved just as much as you do . Ok . Well , if anybody can figure out what this stuff is for , it 's Alec . You know where he is ? Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey , what are you doing here ? I needed to talk to you . You 're mad at me . There 's no guide to parenting kids that are twice your age . I was upset , I didn 't mean to take it out on you . I 'm sorry . That did a lot of things . I learned to let it go . Water . Duck 's back . He was hard on you . On everyone . Your mother ? Don 't want to talk about her . I think we should . I want to have a different kind of relationship with you . In order to do that we have to be honest . I need to know who she is . Oh , ok . Not ... not alright . Not ... You told me that Emily is not my future . Your mom is . But I mean now . That 's fate . Destiny . After all that we 've changed , you really still believe in all that ? Let me meet her and then we can see for ourselves . No . No . No . It 's a bad , super bad idea . Jason , please . Ok ? I 'm stuck . I don 't know if my path is fixed , unchangeable . How will I ever know unless I confront this ? But not now , not through me . If our fate is set , the timing doesn 't matter . Please . I don 't know if she 's even in the city . You can find her , ok ? I believe in you . Ok , so you find her and I 'll go fight crime . Call me later , alright ? Hi . Hello . You can each fill in one of these forms ... We 're here to make a withdrawal . This isn 't that kind of bank . We 're aware . Everybody down , now ! [ Screams ] Tonkin , this way ! How was your reunion ? I did what you asked . You 're not the only one who admired Marcellus . I loved him like a brother . Yeah , well I killed his killer . Maybe it 's time you start trusting me . Grab that . Take it all . We 're stealing blood ? You 'll catch up one of these days . I 'm not content , Vasquez . You 're the world 's most boring babysitter . Marcellus briefed you . He told me what I wanted to hear . If anyone knows the power of seduction and empty flattery , it 's me . There 's no man more devoted to your cause . Never bullshit a bullshitter . What 's going on ? That future you came from doesn 't look so bright . Somewhere along the line I mess up , and knowing that pains me . You help me cure that and I can be very generous . You think it 's all about you ? Every time I look in the mirror . Self-belief got me to the top of the mountain . I plan to stay . Join me . You told me this might happen . Unattainable women were always your Achilles Heel . [ Choking ] Ok . [ Gasping ] Tell me something I don 't know . You 're a shadow of the man that he is . Yeah , but I 'm the shadow you need . And this shadow wants to see what he bought . Get in . No shots fired , they just scared the hell out of everyone and cleared the place out . Blood . More than 100 litres . Why ? Maybe they 're vampires . Excuse me ? So mechanical equipment , medical gear , and now this . You only need blood if you plan on spilling a lot of it . Mmm-hmm . So they plan on going to war . Against who ? I pulled the security footage . You won 't like it . This is a long play . Face it , Kiera . He came here as part of their mission . It sure looks like he 's back on that playbook . He killed other you . And he risked his life to save me more than once . He 's Jekyll and Hyde . You really want to gamble that he 's not going to flip again ? I will get to the truth . Then do it . Results in 24 hours or I 'm going to assign this case to someone else . So I built a three dimensional simulation of the device based on the telemetry you got . It should be done in a few minutes . This has to be for time travel . Nothing else makes sense . I 'm mapping unknown energy patterns to incomplete infrastructure . It 's the best guess until we learn more . Well , if our best guess is correct , maybe we don 't need Kellogg . I would trust Kellogg more than I do Brad at this point . And he can call off the Piron guards if - If . I want to tell Carlos . I feel bad leaving him in the dark like this . You tell Carlos about the warehouse , he 's gonna rush in with the cavalry . You scattered enough ashes . It 's a focal point . These energy patterns are all over the place . Optical turbulence , non-linearity . Oh my god . Alec , what just happened ? Have they managed to steal any radioactive isotopes ? Deuterium ? Tritium ? I don 't know . Well , you better find out . This could be a pure fusion weapon . If they successfully build and trigger this , hundreds of thousands die . No , you can 't go there , not alone . I can 't stay here and watch that again and again . [ Phone vibrates ] Hello ? Where are you ? Coming to find you . Don 't . I 'll be at our favourite park in an hour . Once the transducer ray is linked , we 'll be a few hours away from a full-spool up test . How 's security ? It 's under control . What 's that mean ? Someone 's on the monitor all day making sure no one enters using a cloaking device ? No , I 've taken steps to counter it . Man , that 's one hell of a ray gun ! Does this thing shoot aliens ? Commander insisted on seeing what he bought . Yeah . The Commander would also like to know what it 's for . I regret Commander , that 's up to Marcellus to tell you . He 's not here at the moment . Excuse me . Then what can you tell me , and who are you ? Robert Zorin , Commander . Please . Come meet the rest of the team . Kellogg 's soldiers have this device . I 'm trying to put all the pieces together but so far it seems like this is the finale . It 's a fusion bomb ? I 'm not sure . You 're never wrong . It 's missing something . A key piece of the puzzle that 's not there yet . I have the key . Wait , you recognize this tech ? No , no , no . The key . The future key . You . Me . Mom . That device they 're building is a bomb . A massive one . Did you know ? No , I don 't believe that . We 're not terrorists . Have they stolen any radioactive materials ? They stole advanced computers . Medical supplies . It 's not a bomb . Brad , you have to give me something . I called you , remember ? I saw some documents . An address to a storage facility . They stole something a few days ago , they never brought it back to the building . It must be stashed there . If it is a bomb , I 'll stop them . And if it 's not ? You 're still on mission ? I wish we never triggered that beacon . I was out , walking a new path with you . You can 't always run from your past . Sometimes you have to confront it head on . Risk everything for a new future . I want to believe you . Then make that choice . If your intel is good , we could be walking into a trap . There 's only one way to find out . That 's reassuring . No heat signatures . No explosives . What is that ? It 's a dialysis machine . Here . I found her Instagram account . Really loves cat videos . You sure ? I 'm pretty sure I 'd recognize my own mother . Wouldn 't you ? So I met her in my 30 's ? How ? Did I pursue her , or was it the other way around ? Dad wasn 't exactly Mr. Nostalgia . I never really got the whole story . Ok , you wanted to see her , you saw her . Let 's go . I 'm hungry . You ? Woah , woah ! Time out . You can 't . We 've come this far . It 's too far ! This is over the edge , no parachute . A little theatrical , isn 't it ? Even for you . I 've got a fondness for this place . In a strange way , it 's home . Summerville Holdings is a subsidiary of Piron . Ok . We raided a storage locker that was rented by Summerville , AKA you , and what we found lead us to a terrorist cell . So A plus B equals me . It sure looks that way . And I 'm assuming you can tie me directly to these terrorists ? Tell me what they 're planning , Kellogg . Or the blood they spill is on your hands . Well , I wouldn 't want that . You know , if you 're looking for someone who 's in bed with the enemy , why not start with the only person who 's actually been in bed with them ? I have a feeling there 's all kinds of things Kiera 's not telling you . Everyone 's got a blind spot . She used to be mine . Hey , maybe now she 's yours . Marcellus has requested additional security personnel . Oh , Marcellus did , did he ? Well , you tell Marcellus , or whoever is in charge now , that I 'm tired of being instructed . I get full mission disclosure or the money and the personnel tap shuts off . It 's just lunch . Say hello , and I 'll get a better sense of who she is . Sure , sure . You could introduce yourself . Hey , I 'm your future husband . The older guy here is our future kid . Yeah , she 'll fall for you straight away . It doesn 't have to get that weird . It 's already a supernova of weird . There are things I haven 't told you . I really only remember her from pictures . Vid files . She was ill when I was young and she died . I never really got to know her . Maybe it should stay that way . Hey , guys . I hope you haven 't been waiting for too long . A couple of years , give or take . Just kidding . You want coffee to start ? Coffee , great . Um ... and for him ? Um ... milk . Is something wrong ? No . No . Well , yeah . You got no idea . So , what 's good here , Annie ? Uh , the club sandwich is amazing , and if you want something sweet the apple pie is great . Just like mom used to make it . Ok , that 's not good . No , no . I gotta go . Is he ok ? Yeah . Pie sounds good . Pie . You want to tell me what 's going on ? Sliding doors . Look at them . He 's reading the newspaper and she 's got her dog . You can look up and say hello maybe and it would be the start of a whole new life . A future . Or maybe she carries on and it 's nothing . Passing ships . Every moment is a crossroads . Yeah , but they 're not like us . They have no idea the implications of their choices . Those two could have a life-long romance or maybe one night he strangles her in her sleep . We 're trapped , Kiera . Every choice that we make leads to a different outcome . It 's not as though we can stop making them . Yeah , but we keep getting confronted by the futures we create . We can 't be whimsical or impulsive . There 's too much at stake . We both tried to opt out once before , remember ? It didn 't work out so well , did it ? I don 't know what to do anymore . I 'm terrified of making everything worse . I have faith in you , Alec . Yeah . Is that why you invited me here ? A pep talk ? No . I got a message saying you wanted to meet me here . You have a bad habit of appearing out of shadows . Maybe I 'm leading you into the light . What do you want ? The same thing as you . Somehow I doubt that . Your agenda and your loyalties have always been suspect . That was before I understood my true purpose . The mystery man the freelancers own ? If it wasn 't for the traveller I wouldn 't be here . The only thing that comes back from the dead are gods and zombies . So unless you 're the second coming - Multiple timelines . You know they exist . Different branches , different versions of ourselves . My consciousness was pulled from one reality , brought here , fused . The energy of one reanimating the other . People aren 't car batteries , you can 't just jump-start them . You mock what you don 't understand . Because there 's no scientific precedent . It 's beyond the bounds of possibility . So is time travel until you make it possible . You open a door that can never be closed . With help from the traveller we can prevent the ripples from becoming tsunamis . This time-traveller . Why did he bring you back ? What does he want ? To make things right . He came from a time hundreds of years from now . He was chosen , sent back to observe history . To chronicle it , but not to interfere . Somewhere in time the traveller changed something . Exist . With no clear path to repair it , he went further back in time . Found acolytes . Freelancers . They failed . You break time , everyone suffers the consequences whether they know it or not . But there 's still a chance . He 's here for a reason . Something about the way things are unfolding , taking place now , has given him hope . A moment is coming , a chance to repair everything . The two of you , Brad , the machine they 're building , all will play their part . So it 's our job to fix time ? Are you serious ? You invented time travel . Doesn 't it make sense that you help put the genie back in the bottle ? No . No , I don 't buy it . All this pseudo-science is just metaphysical bullshit . I 'm out . [ Gasping ] [ Gasping ] Holy shit ! What is this ? What 's happening ? I don 't know . Who are you ? I forgot how innocent I was . You 're me . How is this happening ? Are you in my dream or am I in yours ? This is not a dream . It 's a paradox . He must have wanted us to meet . He ? The traveller . The time traveller . Time travel ? A theory no longer , it seems . We 're way beyond theory . Everything that you 've done , all the dominos that have fallen ? I haven 't done anything . Yet . But now I 'm thinking perhaps it 's not a good idea . So what is this ? The universe is shifting , sweeping destiny along with it . Because I met Annie . You 're not supposed to meet her yet . You loved her . Profoundly . In spite of myself . How long were you together before she became ill ? Who told you that ? That 's a story we fed to others . I ... I killed her . She came to see me for who I really am . She ... she ran . She tried to escape , with our son , Jason . Before I could track them down ... she took her own life . I destroyed her and I lost myself because of it . I can 't undo it , but you can . How ? If I could think I 'd known how I would have done it . You 're the me that 's supposed to have all the answers . Maybe it 's the other way around . Maybe I 'm here to learn from you . Of course . The message . Kiera . Kiera ? Kiera Cameron , the one that ... never mind . Yeah , you 've made mistakes , but your instincts are right . Time travel , the power to change things ? It 's not an experiment . It 's the answer . Do it . Thank you . I don 't understand . You will . The power generator in the room below triggers the device . Send them back . Why me ? Because you will inherit my failure if I don 't succeed , and I wouldn 't wish that on anyone . You can count on me , father . I speak to you , not as who you 'll become , but as an old man who knows you best . I have gone down a dangerous path and I have taken the world with me . What the hell ? [ Explosion ] [ gasping ] Alec ? Oh my god ! Oh my god , what happened ? Are you ok ? [ Gasping ] As per your request . VPD case files on all the robberies that are being linked to this new group of terrorists . Terrorists ? That 's a little harsh . You 're annoyed . Those files are classified . I don 't work there anymore , I had no business taking them . It 's not our fault they didn 't lock them - Please don 't ask me to do that again . Piron is the VPD . The VPD is Piron . We 're one big happy family . Is that why I 'm here ? The key to a lock you 're not supposed to open ? Jack , please . What , you think I 'm manipulating you ? I 'm contacting Carlos and I am having my access revoked . Do you really think your precious VPD would have taken care of you the way I have ? Picked you up when you couldn 't stand on your own two feet ? Restored your dignity ? Well , I really didn 't give it a chance , did I ? You 've got a bright future here , Jack . But to embrace it , you gotta let go of the past . Can you do that ? Curtis said " a moment is coming . " " A chance to repair everything . " What did he mean ? How is Brad a part of it ? The universe is shifting , sweeping destiny along with it . You sound like Curtis . It 's just something I heard in a dream . Or , not a dream . I better get back to work . We have to trust ourselves , each other . There 's no turning back now . Something happened to you back there . Yeah . I 'm not afraid anymore . Carlos ? Give us a sec , would you ? Alec . You know , I 've seen Vegas magicians disappear less than you . And you know who else keeps vanishing ? I have no idea where Kiera is . Really ? Really . You remember when Kiera Cameron supposedly worked for Section Six and you were the kid in the barn keeping her secrets and I was the guy in the dark ? Did we just time travel back there again ? It 's not like that . Alec , look . I get loyalty , ok ? I do . I 've been keeping her secrets for a very long time . I wouldn 't be asking this if I didn 't think she was in danger . So why don 't you tell me where she is ? Right now , because I 'm done playing games . [ door closes ] [ Footsteps ] It 's hard for me to see him in you . Well , people change . So I hear . You 're risking your lives for him . Why ? Because he risked his for us . He hauled off our enemies , he used his guile and resources to buy time . Even though his was running out . Running out ? Kidney failure . He 's dying ? It 's treatable . Huh . If he gets a transplant . Bad habits . They 're gonna be the death of you one day . Hey . Hey . You need to see this . I 've been working on your simulations . Something wasn 't right . Cellinoid coils . Yeah , what about them ? Well , if they rigged them all up together they could use them as a transducer . Look . How did I miss that ? Distracted ? I 'm running some new algorithms right now . There . These should be up in a minute or so . So what happened after I left ? With my mother ? She 's not for me , Jason . She 's sweet , she 's innocent , I don 't want to take that from her . The only way for me to walk a new and better path is for me to not follow in my own footsteps . I 'm sorry . So I never get born ? You did . You 're here and so am I. That 's never gonna change . Here we go . That doesn 't look like a bomb . You genius ! It 's not ! It 's not ! [ Phone rings ] Kellogg ? This better be life or death . I couldn 't have said it better myself . What do you want ? What you said , before . It makes sense to me now . I can 't trust myself . Wow . And I thought narcissistic sociopaths weren 't capable of self-evaluation . I guess this one is . I 'd screw anyone over . Even me . Are you drunk ? Not drunk enough . We need to work together . Brad , Marcellus , what they 're up to , it 's bad . For you and me . I 'm not gonna take you seriously . I am dead serious . Emphasis on the dead . I am the last person in the world you should trust , which is why , in this case , you have to trust me . Give me one reason why I would ever do that . Because I 'm the guy holding your golden ticket . The only means to send you home . Think about it . VPD busted the locker . They have the dialysis machine . What ? You were supposed to divert her , keep her from here , not give her something that we need . She 's smart . She wasn 't gonna be distracted for long . We 'll get another one . We 're running out of time . She 's near the building ? Yeah , let me talk to her . I 'll get her to leave . Take care of it . No , you don 't ! Tonkin , take it easy . You , stand down . Put that down . Tonkin ? Ok . You want to know what we 're doing ? We 're building a portal . A lifeboat . To rescue our people . They escape our time , they come here . There 's hundreds of names on that list . Take a look . Now you see ? Emma Tonkin ? My sister . Yeah . And her two kids . Your nephews . Just waiting to come through . No . No , they died in the Squamish massacre . No , they survived . All of them . But if you sabotage this , they die for sure . Is that what you want ? You let me handle her my way . I thought I had been clear . Clear isn 't exactly the word I would use . Did you really think I wouldn 't find out you had been tracking me ? I was trying to keep you safe . By protecting them ? Maybe you 've been playing me since we met . What we had was never false . Had . Past tense . The ground keeps shifting . Maybe we don 't want the same things anymore . Maybe you should just kill me . Isn 't that what you came here to do ? Look , I swear , Kiera , what is happening is not dangerous . You need to walk away and let us do what we have to do . I can 't . You hold the key to me getting what I want . Put the gun down . It 's not gonna happen . You came here to kill her . Now put it down . It 's not that simple , Carlos . He murdered the other you . He 's not your ally . Open your eyes . Kiera , after everything we 've been through I need you to hear me . You get him out of here or he ends up like Lucas . I am sorry I didn 't tell you . I already knew . Now get the hell out of the way . It was something I wanted so badly I thought I couldn 't tell you . Maybe I can 't trust him , but I need him . I didn 't want to tell him where you were , but he forced my hand . Alec , it 's ok . No more deception . Tell him what we know . Well , it 's gonna be news to you , too . Jason found the missing piece of the puzzle . Everything 's changed . The energy patterns here ? They 're not explosive . They 're implosive . The device is literally punching a hole in the space-time continuum . And what is that ? It 's a tethered wormhole . Uh , you want to try explaining that to me like I don 't have a degree in physics ? Sure . It 's like an elevator , but instead of going up and down it moves through time . A time elevator ? A portal through time between now and the future . The energy provides a stable limited connection . That 's why they needed to build it in that exact location . The two sides need to be exactly the same in both time periods or else it 's not gonna work . They are very likely bringing people back from their future . The supplies they 've stolen ? Blood ? Medicine ? Those are the kinds of things an army needs . Yeah , for an invasion . We have to stop it . Yeah , of course we do . But there 's also a very tiny silver lining to this dark cloud . That 's a temporal matrix running within a cortex . It 's a two-way street . With the time ball and their power source , it may be possible to hybridize it so you could - Travel forward . You asked me to send you home . With this machine complete , I 'm almost certain I can do exactly that .

 STEVE : This thing 's moving too fast , and it 's heading for New York . CARTER : Give me your coordinates . I 'll find you a safe landing site . There 's not gonna be a safe landing , but I can try and force it down . ( STAMMERS ) I 'll get Howard on the line . He 'll know what to do . I got to put her in the water . Please , don 't do this . We have time . We can work it out . Peggy . This is my choice . ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( TEAKETTLE WHISTLING ) ( SONG PLAYING ON RADIO ) I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late-night fondue . Stark is the best civilian pilot I 've ever seen . We 're lucky to have him . ( MAN GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) - Don 't bother . - Colleen . I can 't feel my feet . They let 10 girls go yesterday . ( SNEEZES ) Did they say why ? Because 10 more GIs got discharged . I had to show a guy from Canarsie how to use a rivet gun . Oh . I think I have tuberculosis . Thanks , by the way . You loaned this to me last night while you were at work . ( SCOFFS ) It looks better on you . Kind of thing might really catch a man 's eye ... Say , on a date ? Well , don 't hold your breath , especially with tuberculosis . You know , there 's a difference between being an independent woman and a spinster . Is it the shoes ? ( CHUCKLES ) Clock out , pull the curtains , and sleep . Peggy 's orders . ( SIGHS ) ' Kay . If I don 't see you , remember , we 're going to the movies on Saturday . - I have the night off . - I 'll try . You know how busy the office keeps me . Peg , you work at the phone company . It ain 't life and death . Darling , you have no idea . ( HORNS HONKING ) ( JACKHAMMER POUNDING ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( TELEPHONES RINGING ) Good morning , Rose . Lot of hubbub today , Peg . DC line 's hot . Love the hat . ( GEARS GRINDING ) ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) MAN : Who was the asset on that ? MAN 2 : The asset was ... ( TELEPHONE RINGS ) ( ALARM BUZZING ) Agent Carter , we just caught a redball out of DC . All hands on deck . Meaning cover the phones . Rose , forward all calls to the briefing room . Covered . Shall we ? - ( FANFARE PLAYING ) - ( PROJECTOR RUNNING ) ANNOUNCER : Americans have long followed the career of inventor Howard Stark , from boy genius to weapons developer to multimillionaire . Even more have followed his private life . But his most recent exploits threaten to send this flyboy into a nosedive . Accused of selling weapons to the enemy , the founder of Stark Industries was recently called to Capitol Hill . May I ask a question ? WEBSTER : Not until you answer the question already before this committee . It 's been so long , I don 't even remember what it was . Did you knowingly sell military-grade technology to enemies of the United States ? Not knowingly . Did you do it unknowingly ? Now , by definition , that would be impossible to answer . - ( LAUGHTER ) - ( CHUCKLES ) ( PROJECTOR STOPS ) So far , six pieces of Stark 's technology have turned up either on the black market or in the arsenals of enemy states . He 's been waffling on the hill , treating the whole thing like a joke . Yesterday was the final day of hearings . Stark didn 't show . They checked his half a dozen houses and his half a dozen offices . Nothing . So , as of this moment , Howard Stark is not only in contempt of Congress , he 's a fugitive from justice . Find him . Squeeze him till he loses his sense of humor . Thompson . You 're lead . I 'll ground his planes , freeze his bank accounts . There 's a girl at First Federal who wants to owe me a favor . Sir , I really must object . Why am I not surprised ? I knew Howard Stark during the war . His help was invaluable . He may be a great many things , but he 's not a traitor . We 're all aware of your record , Agent . I 'm sure being Captain America 's ... Liaison ... Brought you into contact with all sorts of interesting people . But the war 's over . Let the professionals decide who 's worth going after . Sounds like Carter knew a lot of guys during the war . What 'd you say , Krzeminski ? I wasn 't talking to you . You owe the lady an apology . Oh . You standing up for her now , Sousa ? Better hurry . I don 't have all day . Huh ? No ? Okay . ( BOTH LAUGH ) Agent Sousa , about what you just did ... Ah , don 't worry about it ... I wish you hadn 't . You 're an agent . They treat you like a secretary . - I just wanted ... - And I 'm grateful . I 'm also more than capable of handling whatever these adolescents throw at me . Yes , ma 'am . Doesn 't mean I have to like it , though . Well , that 's another thing we have in common . Carter ? Gonna be a little busy with your friend , Stark . If you don 't mind , these surveillance reports need to be filed , and ... You 're really so much better at that kind of thing . What kind of thing is that , Agent Thompson ? The alphabet ? I can teach you . Let 's start with words beginning with " A. " ( CHUCKLES ) Thanks , kid . Adios . Auf wiedersehen . Aloha . Poor guy . Heard he got his personality shot off in Iwo Jima . ( BIG-BAND MUSIC PLAYING ) I saw him once at a USO show in Passaic . You can eat him with a spoon . Yes , I understand he was quite something . - ( BELL DINGS ) - COOK : Order up ! Everything all right , English ? Fine , Angie , if you don 't count work . Boys at the phone company giving you a hard time ? No more than usual . It 's just ... During the war , I had a sense of purpose , responsibility . But now I connect the calls , but I never get a chance to make them . Do you know what I mean ? I had an audition today , uptown . Took three trains , got two bars into Is You Is Or Is You Ain 't ... They gave me the hook . I guess I ain 't . We all got to pay our dues , even if it takes a while . You got talent . It 's just a matter of time before Broadway calls . I 'm afraid I can 't carry a tune . Doesn 't matter when you got legs like yours . MAN : This is supposed to be a BLT ? Where 's the girl ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Do you not work here anymore ? Looks like I got to go . Is he a regular ? Yeah , but a regular what , I 'm not allowed to say that on the clock . See ya later . ( SONG PLAYING ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) MAN : Miss Carter ? Do I know you ? Oh , we haven 't had the pleasure . But we may yet . You 're coming with me . ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( TIRES SQUEALING ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) I know . I should 've called first . Did you miss me ? CARTER : They 're calling you a traitor . I 'm calling it a setup . I have a vault . " Had , " I should say . Sub-basement of my office . Triple-thick , lead-lined . It was where I kept my bad babies . Bad babies ? Inventions too dangerous for anyone ... Even my friends . Which begs the question , why invent them at all ? I can 't help what I think of , but I can damn well control what I sell . At least , I could until last month . CARTER : What happened last month ? I was in Monaco ... With a lovely tax advisor . When I got back , I found a hole under my vault , all the way to the sewer . Somebody cleaned me out . A couple of weeks later , my bad babies , they start turning up on the black market . But why run ? Why not tell the Senate the truth , ask for their help ? Apparently , it 's not too big a jump to see me cutting a hole in my own vault and making some money on the sly . Really ? I 'm just considering all the angles . Seems you have a lot of them . Now , that 's the Peggy Carter I need . - For what ? - To clear my name . You can 't be serious . I try not to be , but sometimes it just slips out anyway . Oh , come on , Peg . You know darn well I didn 't do this , which means the SSR is looking for the wrong guy . I want to find the right guy . But I 'm gonna need someone on the inside , someone I can trust . And , Peg , there 's no one I trust more than you . Howard , you 're asking me to become a traitor in order to prove you are not one . - You do see the irony ? - Come on , Peg . I know they 're not using you right over there . You want a mission that matters ? This is it . My technology in the hands of some nut that wants to be the next Red Skull ... You have no idea how bad that could be . Right now , you 're the only one that can stop that . Here 's good . Kill the lights . ( ENGINE SHUTS OFF ) ( BUOY BELL RINGS ) Where are you headed ? Some of my babies have already sold overseas . I 'm gonna pay them a visit . The rest of them are here somewhere , which is where you come in . Word is , one of the nasty ones is hitting the market in the next day or two . What is it ? Just a piece of paper ... My formula for molecular nitramene . Technically , we 're not even sure it works , but , well , let 's face it . I invented it , so it works . If that stuff were ever fabricated ... Boom ? This much would level a city block . And I 'm not talking the short ones . Avenues . I 'm going to regret this , aren 't I ? Absolutely . But when you 're not humiliating him , that fellow up there is my butler , Edwin Jarvis . He 'll help you in any way he can . I owe you one , pal . ( BUOY BELL RINGS ) There are only a dozen fences that can handle something this hot . ( BOAT ENGINE STARTS ) You just got to learn which one . And I figured you 'd never have any trouble finding a man . The trick is finding the right one . Nice to see you , too , Howard . The next time you approach a woman in a dark alley , you might introduce yourself . Well , I shall endeavor to remember that , provided my concussion isn 't too severe . Should you need me . Call any time before 9 : 00 . What happens at 9 : 00 ? My wife and I go to bed . 7 : 00 , sherry . 8 : 00 , Benny Goodman . 9 : 00 , bed . You 're new to espionage , aren 't you ? Far from it . Last summer , I caught the cook pocketing the good spoons . What now , Miss Carter ? Now I go to work . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( HORNS HONKING ) ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) You know , you are expected to go home at night . Most fugitive cases are solved in the first 72 hours . If Stark 's sailing into the sunset , maybe this is where he starts . He must have really liked that girl . Hmm ? Because there 's no other reason why he 'd get in a boat . I 'm sorry , Daniel , but Stark hates water . He can 't even swim . Really ? How do you ... He tried to kiss me on V-E day . I knocked him into the Thames . We had to get frogmen to fish him out . MAN : ... classified information ... CARTER : Something 's up . Thompson 's working on his next medal . Got word of a fence trying to sell one of Stark 's inventions ... Club owner named Spider Raymond . Where 's it happening ? Need-to-know only . Kind of gives you a warm feeling , doesn 't it ? - Get you a refill ? - Actually , I 'm still ... Drinking that . Post eyes at the exits and at the newsstand across the street . Dress sharp ... Handkerchiefs , spit shine . It 'll be a rich crowd . Do your best . I 'll call O 'Dwyer , get you some uniformed backup . Too showy . Raymond 's paranoid . Only things he lets slide are blondes and money . If we want to grab Raymond and his buyer with whatever it is that Stark is selling , then I go in light and fast . We want everyone feeling real comfortable . Two men , side arms only . That how you did it in Okinawa ? Sometimes . Other times , we brought a tank . Figured we 'd save that for later . ( CHUCKLES ) Okay , Thompson , this is your play . Grinding beans over there , Carter ? This is field agents only . It 's okay , Chief . Let her stay . Maybe she 'll learn something . Thank you , Agent . I already have . What do you really want ? I wonder if I might request a sick day . What 's the matter ? Got a headache ? Amongst other things . Ladies ' things . Oh , geez . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Yeah , sure , take the day . Go shopping , whatever makes you feel better . Thank you for your understanding . Enjoy your coffee . You got any issues need taking care of ? ( BIG-BAND MUSIC PLAYING ) RAYMOND : If this stuff does what you say it can , Brannis , you 're gonna be very rich . And I 'm guessing a fair amount of people are gonna be very dead . You know , we could , uh , do some serious business if you 'd just tell me what else you got out of Howard Stark 's basement . What 've you got ? A-bombs ? Ray guns ? Jane Russell 's number ? ( CHUCKLES ) Well , whatever it is , if you need to liquidate , my door 's open . ( DOOR OPENS ) Nice talking to you . ( MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING ) You look like a lady looking to dance . ( WITH AMERICAN ACCENT ) I 'm afraid I 'd only step on your toes . Another time , perhaps . Oh , no , we 're supposed to be upstairs . ( CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ) I 'm looking for Mr. Raymond . I have something I 'd like to sell . First door on the right . Thanks , sugar . ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Mr. Raymond , is this a bad time ? We 'll only know after it 's over . Bring the rest of you in here . I hope you don 't find me forward . Well , I 'm not the judgmental type . Um ... ( CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) I know you are in , um possession of a certain chemical formula . I got a lot of club to run , miss , so if you 'd just ... It 's okay . Let 's make this a game . You seem like you might like games . You don 't have to tell me anything . You just have to , um ... Look right here . Now , I don 't care where you got it , but cards on the table ... You are the proud owner of a certain chemical formula . Just a little piece of paper , right ? I have some friends who would be very interested in buying that formula . Now , I know I said , " Spider Raymond , " he doesn 't hold on to anything for long . " He must already have a buyer . " But , you see , the thing is , I think I can ... Offer you more . Is it here ? Do you want me to search you ? Sweetheart , I don 't have it on me . ( CHUCKLES ) ( GRUNTING ) ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Hey , boss , there 's a guy downstairs that 's ... I guess I 'll just have him wait . ( SIGHS ) ( NORMAL ACCENT ) Well , that was a bit premature . ( DIAL CLICKING ) ( LOCK CLICKS ) Crikey O 'Reilly . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) ( SONG PLAYING ON RADIO ) Jarvis residence . - They 've weaponized it . - Miss Carter ? Do you know anyone else handling high explosives at this time of night ? Oh , as a matter of fact , no . It 's just that I promised my wife a soufflé . And if I don 't get it in the oven by ... Mr. Jarvis , what was once a theory is now a bomb , so apologies to your wife , but dinner will have to wait . No , you 're quite right . Mr. Stark left a note . Hold the line . ( SONG CONTINUES ) Is the nitramene , by any chance , glowing ? Yes . Oh , that 's not ideal . " An orange glow would indicate " the nitramene has reached peak volatility " and should be handled with caution . " Cracking its shell would result in an implosion " with a blast radius of ... " Oh . 500 yards . ( SCOFFS ) Delightful . " Render it inert with a solution " of sodium hydrogen carbonate and acetate . " Where you 're going to find that at this time of night , I have no idea . - Leave that to me . - There 's one last note here . " Avoid touching the core to the containment ring . " Touching the core will result in ... " Death ? I was going to say " core overload , " but yes . - ( DOOR OPENS ) - ANNA : Edwin , I 'm home ! Uh , I won 't be a moment , Anna ! If that will be all ? Mr. Jarvis , you do realize that this job will have certain after-hours requirements ? So does my wife , Miss Carter . Good night . - ( CLICK ) - ( DIAL TONE ) ( JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ) You boys got a warrant , or are you just here to socialize ? Both . You don 't mind if we take a look around , do you ? ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( GASPS ) Boss ? ( MAN GRUNTS ) You don 't say . ( WITH AMERICAN ACCENT ) Fancy a dance ? I 'm so glad you changed your mind . What can I say ? It 's every woman 's right . Oh , no . No , no , no ! Hey , now . Listen , friend , I know we had a deal , but the blonde must 've taken it . I can fix this . ( SILENCED GUNSHOT ) - Dip me . - What ? Thanks , doll . We should try it again sometime . Maybe we shouldn 't have spent all that time changing our clothes . Seal the damn exits . ( SWITCH CLICKS ) Peg ? Is that you ? ( SIGHS ) Oh , hey . They sent me home , fever . I didn 't know what time you 'd be back . I can take the chair . No , don 't even think about it . ( SNIFFLES ) I 'll make you some tea . Wow . Peg , you look like a million bucks . Wait . Were you out , out ? In a manner of speaking . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , Peg , I 'm ... I 'm really proud of you . I knew you were too great a catch to be alone for too long . I want you to tell me all about it ... In the morning . ( FIZZING ) ( ENERGY CRACKLES ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( SIGHS ) - ( CLATTERING ) - Colleen ? Is everything all right ? ( BOTTLE CLANKS ) Colleen ? ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) ( FLOORBOARDS CREAK ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GAS HISSING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( LOUD THUD ) ( DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE ) ( SOBBING ) JARVIS : I 'm sorry to appear callous , but is there any way it can be traced back to you ? My name wasn 't on the lease . No one knew me except ... Did she have any family ? She lost a brother at Guadalcanal . I 'd only known her a few months . I needed a place to stay . I didn 't know anyone in ... I seem to have a habit of losing people closest to me . Perhaps " losing " is too nice a word . I get them killed . Miss Carter . When Howard came to me , I was damn happy to see him . I 'd been wallowing in it since the war , wondering why no one would give Agent Peggy Carter a shot . So I grabbed the chance . But I mucked it up . And now Colleen is dead ... Because of me . Miss Carter , I 've read your war record . You are a credit to your profession . If the men in your office can 't see that , then they 're fools . You were trying to do something good , and I believe you accomplished it . But was it worth it ? I don 't think we 'll know that until the job is truly done . ( SIGHS ) Where does your wife think you are right now ? One of Mr. Stark 's more amorous admirers has refused to vacate his penthouse . I am presently supervising her extraction . I imagine that 's quite believable . ( COUGHS ) You have no idea . ( CHUCKLES ) We need to know where this came from . But I can 't exactly walk it into the SSR headquarters . ( SOFTLY ) I may know a gentleman . JARVIS : Dr. Vanko , what do we have here ? DR. VANKO : A lanthanum carbon alloy . Rather clever . I might add , rather unstable . So it couldn 't have come from very far away . Well , before the war , there were only three refineries capable of something like this . The Navy tore down Franklin Chemical , and Eaglestar converted to diesel , so that only leaves ... CARTER : Roxxon . VANKO : Right . This has to be 200 acres . It would take weeks to search . Dr. Vanko , please tell me that isn 't still , um ... Volatile . Oh , volatile ... No , no . Active ? ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , yes . The nitramene still emits low levels of vita-radiation . Vita-rays ? Yeah , we occasionally use them in our experiments to stabilize the ... I know what they do . ( HORN HONKING ) I 'm gonna need a rain check on that dance . A week next Saturday , at the Stork Club . You got it . 8 : 00 on the dot . Don 't you dare be late . Just be there . We 'll have the band play something slow . I 'd hate to step on your ... ( STATIC ) Steve ? Steve ... ( CRUTCH CLICKS ) Sorry . I still haven 't quite got the hang of ... It 's fine . I can assure you , I don 't do this often . You know , after I got hit ... At the field hospital , the chaplain asked me was there anybody I wanted to send my effects to , should , you know , the worst happen . I told him I didn 't think my dad had much use for two pairs of green socks and an old paperback . Let him remember my life , you know ? 'Course , I didn 't die , which was inconvenient , because the chaplain had already trashed my footlocker . Still missing half my stuff . Can 't find my leg anywhere . ( CHUCKLES ) Daniel . You 're one of the lucky ones . ( SIGN BUZZING ) ( STATIC ) ( TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING ) ( STATIC CRACKLING ) ( TYPEWRITER BELL DINGS ) ( BELL DINGS ) ( STATIC CRACKLING ) ( BELL DINGS ) CARTER : Well-armed for a mothballed facility , wouldn 't you say ? Keep your eyes open . But I 'm coming with you . Mr. Jarvis , that cook with the spoons ... Was she a large woman ? Violent ? Well , no , she was quite diminutive , actually , but she had a vicious tongue and extremely long fingernails . ( DEVICE HUMMING ) Oh . Oh ! ( CLANK ) ( GRUNTS ) ( CANISTER HISSES ) Takes a minute to cool . I 'm taking a pretty big risk doing this . Least you could do is smile . ( GASPS ) JARVIS : Miss Carter , it seems that ... ( CLICK ) ( BEEP ) ( DEVICE SQUEALS ) ( SCREAMS ) ( PANTING ) That 's far enough ! I wouldn 't . ( SYNTHESIZED ) You don 't want to fire again . Who are you ? I 'm an independent businessman just trying to make his mark . By murdering people ? I don 't murder people . I just sell to people who do . And what about your friend ? Green suit ? Scar on his throat like yours ? He 's not my friend . Tell me his name , or so help me God , I 'll blow us both to hell . He doesn 't have a name anymore . And you can go ahead and pull that trigger , 'cause if he 's here , we 're both dead anyway . Leviathan is coming . Who ? They 'll tell you themselves soon enough . You 're not gonna like the future ... Such as it is . 30 seconds , Agent . ( TIRES SQUEALING ) Mr. Jarvis , do you think you could bring the car around ? Of course . When would you like it ? Oh , in about 20 seconds . ( TIRES SQUEALING ) - MAN : Stop him ! - ( MACHINE-GUN FIRE ) Meet me on the access road ! You know I 'm being shot at ! Now ! I 'm terribly sorry , Mr. Stark ! Where are you ? Just keep driving ! Could you be slightly more specific ? No ! - Miss Carter ? - Go ! Go ! Don 't you want to get in ? ( GRUNTS ) Drive faster ! We 've only got 10 seconds ! What happened back there ? If we live , I 'll tell you all about it . - Faster ! - I am going faster ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) It would seem it works . SOUSA : Flight manifests turned up nothing . We got a call in to London . I know a guy there . He 's ... We were in the middle of something here , Jack . That bouncer from the broom closet finally came to . Says he caught a blonde with Raymond 's body around 9 : 30 . Why didn 't he stop her ? 'Cause they 're still pulling staples out of his face . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Get that . Chief Dooley 's office . So we 're looking for an angry blonde . Have you called my house ? And that is where my promotion comes in , Chief . I talked to the club photographer . He thinks he got a shot of her . I 'm thinking real hard about kissing you right now , son . Yeah , I 'll tell him . Double-time this over to the lab , see if we can ... Port authority says Roxxon Refinery just blew up . The whole thing ? Any casualties ? Hard to say . They can 't find the building . Let 's go . You two , you 're with me . ( JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ) CARTER : Perhaps some warm milk . JARVIS : Something a little stronger might be in order . You did very well , Mr. Jarvis . Your wife would be very proud . She must never , ever know . You 'll get used to that . What word did he use ? " Leviathan . " I 'll check Mr. Stark 's files . Provided the SSR hasn 't taken them all . Get some rest . To be perfectly honest ... I 'm not sure I 'll sleep for days . - ( BELL DINGS ) - COOK : Order up ! Hey , honey , you back there , or are you still getting your beauty sleep ? Yes , sir . You 're in early this morning . How can I help ? You do know the difference between real eggs and powdered ones , right ? Believe it or not . I did three weeks in a POW camp . The Nazis fed us better than this . Next time , don 't get smart with me , sweetheart . Your brains aren 't your best feature . ( SMACKS ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) I understand you 're not happy with your meal . - You work here ? - Unfortunately , no . - Ohhh ! - Just so we 're clear , this is pressed into your brachial artery . It may be dull , but I 'm determined . Keep smiling . Once you start to bleed , you 'll lose consciousness in 15 seconds . You 'll die in 90 unless someone comes to your aid . Now , given your recent behavior , how likely do you think that is to happen ? ( GROANS ) To prevent this not entirely unfortunate event from occurring , I 'd suggest you find a new place to eat . Do we understand each other ? - ( STRAINED ) Yeah . - Good . Oh , one more thing . Tip generously . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( JARVIS SIGHS ) Swish the glass with the vermouth , tip it out , then add the gin . Well , I 'm sorry , Mr. Stark , but I 'm afraid I can 't be everywhere at once . Well , you 're quite right . Miss Carter 's an excellent choice . I don 't think she 'll have any suspicions at all .

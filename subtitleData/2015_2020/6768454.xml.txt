 Previously on " Aftermath " ... Why are you dressed like that , like Pioneer Village ? Devyn brought an outside girl here ? We 'll see you shortly . - What do you want ? - Tetracycline . They 're herding all the Feverheads into one zone . I 'm gonna get our baby back . I put cyanide from the bug spray into their drinks . It was coming to take her , but it recognized her . She brought that demon here . How can you say that ? She knows everything about it . She 's seen it before . She hasn 't just seen it . She commands it . She 's casting spells on Devyn now . Lily , who 'd bother ? You know what 's weird ? Mean girls are usually pretty . These ones are total mutts . It 's not you . They 're like that to everyone . We should go for a swim in the lake . You should go for a cold shower . - No , I didn 't mean anything by it . - Go now . Find hard work to do . Like cleaning the eaves , for instance . Yes , ma 'am . You think I 'm into him ? You 're tempting him . But ... [ laughs ] No , no , I ... He 's way too young for me . Look , I 'm so in your debt . God , I would never ... If you 're in our debt , would you please not take the lord 's name in vain over and over again ? Look , I 'm sorry , all right ? I just meant that if it weren 't for you guys , I 'd be completely screwed . I will not accept profanity . Everything was fine here until you came . What 's that supposed to mean ? You know a great deal about demons . I just know what I 've seen here the past few days . - That 's it . - So you say . The reverend brother will decide your case . In the meantime , you 'll go where others are safe from you . Come with me . [ sighs ] You 'll wait here until the reverend is ready for you . What am I supposed to do in here ? Righteous hands are never idle . You might want to wash your things . The reverend brother teaches us that cleanliness is holiness . Right , well , how long am I in here ? Put your faith in the lord . [ lock clicks ] [ ominous music ] So who would you eat first ? What ? We 're all dead except you , and there 's no other food source . Whose body would you eat ? This is too dark . You haven 't thought about it ? No . - Have you ? - Nothing but . All the time . - Really ? - Bri and Mom would suck . Just bones . You and Dad , that 's where the protein is . I liked it better when you were just quiet and sweet . For real , though , I could go for pizza right now . Even just a slice . The apocalypse sucks for pizza . If it keeps you from eating me and Dad , I 'm all for it . Mom ! Dad ! Oh , my God . Oh , God . Awful . Oh ! Car 's clear . Let just see if any of them are still alive . Oh , look at the eyes . Birds ? - Oh . - No other signs of predation . This is awful . You guys , we got to get them out of the way . Do you hear that ? [ rattling noise ] Oh . Hang on a second . What 's that noise ? [ rattling noise ] What 's that sound ? Oh ! He 's alive . He 's moving ! - What ? - Be careful . I will . Sally ? [ gasps ] What is it ? Oh ! Bugs ! Oh ! Oh , no ! - What are these ? - Get away from him ! - Get away from him ! - Get back ! Get back ! [ people yelling ] Get them off ! [ ominous music ] Oh , get off ! Get off ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Wait , wait . - What , don 't get them off ? - Get them off ! - Get them off her ! - Wait . What are they doing ? Oh , my god . Trying to get inside you . Oh ! Is it gone ? Are they gone ? Oh ! All right , clear . Guys , get in the trailer ! Get in the trailer ! Let 's go ! I don 't want to detour . No , we 're going through . Just roll up the windows . Matt , get out of there ! Yeah , roll up your windows ! [ thud ] If we can cut through the airport , Brianna 's about five miles on the other side of it . _ What is this ? It 's where Dr. Rawlins must have brought the tetracycline . - What 's going on ? - It 's locked . We 're gonna have to find another way around for Brianna . Oh , no , we 're not . We don 't have the time . We can 't go in there . People are affected in there . So ? We have tetracycline . Which is useless if you walk into a full outbreak . They 'll just kill you for it . The gate 's locked . We can 't go over the razor wire , Mom . We 're getting Brianna . - Wait . - Sally , move . - What 's the plan ? - Move ! All right . [ engine turns over ] [ horn honks ] Karen , what are you doing ? - Oh , no . - Hey . What 's the damage ? It is broken ? Oh . Can you fix it ? Help you guys ? Whoa . No , no . We 're okay . Broke the fence . There 's gonna be trouble . Yeah , it 's okay , Matt . I got it . You don 't look very well . Never better . Well , I 'm a nurse , and we have some medicine here that could help you , okay ? Dana , could you go grab the tetracycline , please ? So just stay calm and keep a lid on it , and everything will be okay . Oh ! Matt , clear . [ gunshot ] Oh ! - You all right ? - Yeah . Skinwalker ? Demon didn 't come out . It 's definitely a Feverhead . [ sighs ] My dear young lady . Welcome to our home . Thank you . [ sighs ] We should talk about what attacked our cattle . Honestly , I don 't know anything about the cattle . She was very familiar with the demon , Reverend Brother . Only because I 've seen it before . Some sort of ... bird or ... All right , bottom line : I saved her life . That 's because she controls the creature . I don 't think that you consort with demons . I can see that you 're afraid . I 'm not afraid . Elena , would you excuse us for a moment , please ? Reverend Brother , the devil 's boots don 't creak . Helena , honestly . I know that . [ growling ] I 've been looking for you , killer of hosts . How wonderful to see you once again . Reverend Brother ! I heard a demon 's voice ! I was defending myself . The voice came from inside of her . Are you crazy ? He attacked me ! You certainly don 't expect me to believe that . Oh . Oh , Reverend Brother . She 's put some kind of spell on you . No , he is sick , all right ? He is possessed , and he 's dangerous , and he will kill all of you . What do we do with her ? It 's almost night . We 'll put her in the barn . The community will pray on it . We 'll decide what 's best in the morning . [ groaning ] Oh , this is as heavy as a tank . Yeah , a tank made of scrap metal . Just a little further , guys . [ grunting ] Little bit further . [ coughing ] My torn ACL is gonna give out . [ coughing ] Okay , right there . [ all grunting ] [ retching ] Holy crap . Aunt Sally , are you all right ? I just need some more water , honey . Your skin is really red . Is it ? Oh , I 'm sorry I 'm such an idiot . We have tetracycline , so it should be able to take care of this . Okay . What about this hunk of metal ? Well , fate . - Fate ? - Yeah . You still believe in fate ? Till there 's something else to believe in , yeah , I do . Okay . I 'm gonna fix it . Oh , honey . What ? You have ... you have quite a rash . Do I ? Yeah , don 't touch it . Don 't ... don 't touch it . What if it 's a reaction to those bugs ? No , it 's probably all the tinned food . I mean , I 'm just so used to organic , you know ? Right , right . I 'm sure . I 'm sure . Don 't ... don 't ... don 't itch it . [ coughing ] Oh , my god . Okay . Aunt Sally , drink this . - You 're gonna be okay . - Thank you . Here , take the gun , take your sister , - and go find Dr. Rawlins . - Oh , Karen , it 's not that bad . - It 's okay . - No , no , I know . It 's nothing . Totally . It 's fine . You sure you want Dana to go ? She 's pretty freaked . If she has body filled with those bugs , I don 't want you guys anywhere near her , okay ? So go find the doctor . Hurry , hurry . Come on . It 'll be fun . Get off of me ! You 're not listening ! Your reverend is dangerous ! Please ! You can 't keep me in here . [ crying ] Please . Please don 't leave . You can 't leave me in here ! Please ! This is kidnapping ! This is illegal ! [ crying ] Shit . [ screams ] Did I mention that I 'm terrified yet ? That 's another reason to learn how to shoot . Not gonna happen , okay ? Why not ? I don 't want to talk about it . It 's stupid . You couldn 't be stupid if there was money on it . So ... Look , I ... I wish I was religious , but I 'm not , so I ... I just worship life , I guess . All life . I could never kill a living thing . We have a good dad . Before all of this , I was the one Mom took hunting , not him . Yeah , I remember . Bri went with you guys , and I just stayed home and read books with Dad . Right . Now he 's pretty good with a gun . Things change . Well , I 'm the same as I 've always been . Except you listen to krunk . You would like krunk . It 's violent . All I 'm saying is that you need to learn how to defend yourself . Okay , I get that . I do . But throughout everything that 's happened , I 've stayed the same , and I 've hung on to that , and the day that I shoot a gun is the day that I lose myself , so ... I can 't do that , 'cause I 'm all I have left . You got me . Well , good thing . 'Cause that screaming is getting louder . [ people screaming in the distance ] [ rock music playing ] Reminds me of that Miley Cyrus concert Holly dragged me to . The one where the audience tried to eat the band ? Wonder where Holly is now . Sounds like it 's coming from this way . We 're moving towards the noise ? Dr. Rawlins is gonna be with the Feverheads . It 'll be fine . It 's easy for you to say . You have a gun .

Why do you think I have a demon and he doesn 't ? The holier you are , the harder it is for a demon to possess you . Well , maybe demons are smarter than that . Or maybe they know better than to put themselves in a girl who nobody trusts , who goes around taking her top off so people can spy on her ! You shouldn 't say demons are smart . Well , they are .

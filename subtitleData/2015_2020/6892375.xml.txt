 Previously on " The 100 " ... Luna , you 're the last of your kind , the last Nightblood . Will you take it and become the next Commander ? No . We take people in who are done fighting , done killing . Skaikru made me murder my entire family . I have no one left . I 'm sorry for your loss , but the chip , the technology , it affected all of us . I , King Roan of Azgeda , am caretaker of the throne , and keeper of the Flame . The Flame won 't keep the clans at bay forever . If they unite against us ... They come for Skaikru . And the radiation comes for us all . We have to focus on riding out the radiation , finding someplace safe . That 's it . We 're standing in our viable solution . How many of us will the ship sustain without a hydro-generator ? No more than a hundred . Two meals a day for people working as hard as ours , we won 't make any friends . Well , if there 's one thing our people understand , it 's rationing . Besides , once we close those doors , it 'll be one meal a day for the next 5 years . Try one meal every other day . Hunting parties are coming back with less and less . Thanks to your friend Niylah , we 're preserving more meat than ever , but it 's still not enough . Without a way to make water , growing our own protein like we did on the Ark is not an option . Remember that when we 're starving . I won 't be starving because I won 't be inside . Yes , you will . Does that mean you made the list ? No . What about drinking water ? Clarke , don 't change the subject . We need to know who 's gonna be on the inside of these doors when the radiation comes . We don 't need to know now . We need some medical help at the front gate . Looks like we got some sick people there . Do not come any closer . Please . They need Skaikru medicine . Move . Stand back . Nyko . What if it 's a Grounder attack like they did with Murphy ? What happened to them ? The sickness . We lost more than 40 on the way . Luna ? Please don 't turn us away because of what I did to you . Out of my way . Please let me through . Mom , what is this ? Fever , lesions , vomiting . - It 's ARS . - What 's ARS ? Acute radiation sickness . When did the symptoms start ? Not sure . Right before the fish started dying . The fish are dying ? Floating on the sea to the horizon in every direction . It 's not contagious . Let 's get them to medbay . Come on . Come on . I got you . Ok . All right . There you go . It 's already here . It 's not safe for you here . What do you want ? I need you to handle something for me the way you handled Ambassador Rafel . We should speak alone . If you can 't trust Indra , you can 't trust me . The Flame 's been stolen . How ? When ? Just now from my quarters while I was training . How can you be so careless ? We need to lock down this city and search everyone . We can 't . If word gets out that he 's lost the Flame , the other clans will question his rule , Trikru loudest of all . Then I 'll be forced to answer their questions with my army . Or we can just find it . Where do I start ? Whoever did this got in and out of the tower without being seen . In order to risk that , she 'd have to care more about the Flame than her own life . - " She " ? - The new Flamekeeper . Perhaps you should look closer to home . You 're not exactly beloved . My people want an Ice Nation king . The ambassadors don 't . The ambassadors are cowards and know I 'd have their heads , the keepers of the Flame ... fanatics . I 'd do it myself , but my guards won 't let me out of their sight . I 'll handle it . What 's wrong ? You created a killer . In the street , they 're calling her Skairipa , death from above . - I 'm so proud . - You should be . One kill to prevent thousands , that 's good politics . You said there 'd be food here . There should be . These woods have always been good to me . Now there 's not even bugs . Well , fortunately , I 'm not hungry enough for that to be upsetting yet . I actually kind of miss Polis . They had this drink there ... sweet , made out of sheep 's milk . Ontari gave this to you ? Yeah . I told you , it wasn 't all bad . You told me you were trying to survive . I was . - What else wasn 't bad , John , sex ? - Emori ... I don 't want to talk about this . Fine . Then let 's not . I didn 't have a choice , ok ? Emori ... I didn 't have a choice . Where are you going ? I 'm gonna go to Arkadia . What ? Why ? I 'm a better thief than I am a hunter . - I 'll come with you . - No . I 'll draw less attention alone . - Tonight we feast . - Ok . They 're getting worse . There 's got to be something we can do . Delactivene might help , but Raven 's got the meds on lockdown . Leave Raven to me . What , exactly , do the tests show ? The exposure is acute . Without treatment , there 's little to no chance of recovery . It looks like the radiation is internal , ingested from irradiate fish . None of the outbreaks appear to be from airborne exposure . - That 's the good news . - Not for them . You think I deserve this for refusing the Flame ? No one deserves to suffer . Besides , this would 've happened anyway . It 's worth a try . This is all that 's left of my people . Can you save them ? We 'll do everything we can . You have my word . Tell me something good . Raven 's looking for us . So Luna 's rig is here , and if the fish in these waters are dying , well , basically , we 're screwed . I don 't understand . A.L.I.E. said we had 6 months . We don 't . Well , then how long do we have ? It 's hard to say . Radiation is dispersed by jet stream and carried by ocean currents , so it 's not an exact science , but the leading indicators are small species die-offs ... fish , insects . Based on the new data , I 'd say we have ... two months of survivability ... Maybe less . The Ark won 't be ready . It 'll be close . If we triple the man hours and work round the clock , we should be able to achieve a hard seal before the black rain comes . We just have to decide who gets to live here . Raven , we 're not talking about the list again . Clarke , we are running out of time . We have to make a plan for the day we close the doors , drill for it , make sure only the survivors have guns , agree on protocols for dealing with the people who are pissed off they 're not chosen . You asked me to be in charge of rationing , and I am doing it , but choosing who gets to live or die is your specialty . No one 's scheduled to take the Rover . Out of the vehicle . I need to make a run . All supply runs go through me , and shouldn 't you be working on the patch to Sector 5 ? A patch for a ship that can only save a hundred people ? Why are you surprised ? I am an engineer . We have no way to generate water . The harder number is 400 . Can you really sentence 400 more of our own people to death ? We don 't have a choice . What if you do ? What if I told you there might be a fallout shelter less than a day 's drive from here , a fallout shelter built to sustain thousands ? We 've been through the Chancellor 's files . All the bunkers you considered for the hundred were listed as compromised or unviable , and now Mount Weather is , too . Those were government bunkers . A doomsday cult ? That 's right ... the Second Dawn . They built a bunker ? Their whole theology was based on riding out the end of the world . And why didn 't you consider it ? We couldn 't prove it existed . So why are you considering it now ? Because before now , we didn 't need it . You found it , didn 't you ? We can 't be sure unless we check it out . No . No way . We need that Rover for hauling pieces of a 3-ton patch we 're build ... Yeah , but if he 's right , we don 't need a patch . Can I talk to you guys for a second ? Can you please remind Clarke what happened the last time Jaha went looking for salvation ? Raven , if that bunker is real , we can save a lot more than a hundred people . And if it 's not , we 've lost another day . Hey , look . If it 's not , I 'll make the list ... ok ? Oh , do what you want . I 've got a ship to seal . I 'll drive . The end is coming . Hear me as I say it this time . The end is coming , and it 's coming soon . He gave this speech two weeks before the bombs . The world is dark and getting darker all the time . Everything we once trusted has turned on us ... government , religion . Even technology has become a weapon in their hands used to poison our minds . I know you 're in pain . I know you 're afraid , but it doesn 't have to be like this . There is a way out of the darkness . I can show it to you . You can be saved . Join me . Join us , and together when the Horsemen come , from the ashes , we will rise . Please tell me you have more than this . In the two years before the bombs , Cadogan sold off most of the Second Dawn 's real estate holdings , generating tens of million of dollars , but there was one thing he didn 't sell . I found this in his autobiography . It 's his childhood home . His father build a bunker there to save his family . I think Cadogan used the church 's money to expand it . Grew up there . Maybe he kept it for sentimental value . Hmm . His father beat him almost daily in that house . He hated living there . Why keep it if you 're liquidating everything else ? Because that bunker is there . I can feel it . Guy sounds like a religious fanatic to me . Maybe , or maybe he was just a leader willing to do whatever it took to save his people . Look who 's back . Thought you ran off with your ... girlfriend . You jealous , Miller ? There 's enough of me to go around . Of course , Bryan would probably kick my ass , so ... You 're here to stay , John ? Till something better comes along , yeah . Close the gate . All right . Start it up . Already told Jackson , we can 't spare anything , especially not antiradiation meds . We 're talking about 7 doses . That 's a quarter of our supply , Abby , a supply that has to last us for 5 years on an irradiated planet . We 're gonna need every one of those pills , and you know it . You 're right . We put you in charge of the supplies . It 's your call , - but those people ... - Will it work ? Can you guarantee the medicine will save them ? You can 't because delactivene needs to be used within 24 hours of exposure . It 's on the damn label . The rate of effectiveness goes down , yes , but it doesn 't mean it won 't work . - We have to try . - No . There 's a child in there with them . At least give me enough for her . I 'm sorry , but we can 't waste our supply on a long shot . If we can save one life , would you call that a waste ? Even if it worked , even if we could save them today , they 'll be dead from radiation inside two months . You tell yourself that if you need to , but the radiation isn 't killing that child . You are . You 're looking for these ? Where did you g ... never mind . I didn 't know how many you needed , so I took it all . What are you waiting for ? Go . Be doctors . Give it to the child first , and if it works , you give it to the others . I 'm glad you 're back , John . I was worried about you . Thanks . Ok . It 's ok . Ok ? It 's ok . Adria ... it 's ok . You can trust them . It 's like food . Just put it in your mouth and take it down with the water . There you go . That 's it . Easy , easy . Ok . I got you . I got you . What about the others ? We 'll monitor Adria closely for the next few hours . If her symptoms improve , then we 'll treat the adults . Thank you . His father got floated for stealing medicine to save him . Who knew he had it in him ? I did . Hey , no , no , no . What 's the point ? A.L.I.E. used tech to control us . No one will ever take over our minds again . So you 're the new Flamekeeper . This is a sacred space . Leave before you get hurt . Give me the Flame . It does not belong to you or your red-blooded king . I can 't let you leave with it . You don 't have a choice . Good technique . I know it well . Stop . Put down the sword , Octavia . - She has the Flame . - She 's my daughter . I 'll talk to Roan . If we give him back the Flame , I can convince him to show mercy . Azgeda knows no mercy . Give me the Flame , Gaia . It 's around her neck . That 's nothing , a totem she 's worn since she joined the faith . You are interfering in matters you do not understand . Wrong . I 'm a Flamekeeper . I 'm honoring my faith , a faith you once believed in . Don 't you question my devotion . A devoted follower would die before giving the Flame to an unworthy king , an Azgeda king . You pervert our faith . Heda would be ashamed . I 'm doing what 's best for Trikru . You would understand that if you had stayed and done your duty . I was called . My daughter was not meant to wander the earth looking for Nightbloods . My daughter was meant to lead armies . My daughter was meant to lead our people . Looks like you found that daughter now . Roan sent me here to kill you . If I don 't come back with the Flame , he will send others . If the spirit of the Commanders deems it my time , then so be it . Indra , tell me what you want me to do here . Without the Flame , the king is vulnerable . We will need to fight to keep him on the throne . If that 's what you want me to do , I 'll do it for you . - I can run . - He 'll find you . Don 't throw your life away . That 's what you said the day I left . You still don 't understand . The looters . If they find the Flame , they 'll destroy it . I 'll take the tunnel . Wait . Drop your weapons . You 're making a mistake . We just want the tech . No one has to get hurt . No . Give me the pack . No . No . Let go . Give that back . Don 't . Please . That 's not tech . That 's the spirit of the Commanders . Please . Ilian , you don 't have to do this . Yes , I do . Whoo ! They 're gone . Sorry about your necklace . Don 't be . That was a good plan . Thank you . You got what you wanted . So did you . Indra ... She 's family . Roan will still want her head . Not if he doesn 't think it was her . Hey , hey , hey . - What the hell are you doing here ? - Now is not a really good time . Once a cockroach , always a cockroach , huh ? Seriously , Raven , not now . Oh ... We only wasted one dose . Cadogan learned how to survive from his father . They hunted in these woods . This is it . Well , if anyone 's entitled to a lucky break , we are . You hear that ? No insects . What ? Luna said the fish were dying . What are the things that eat the fish and bugs gonna eat now ? What happened to us deserving a lucky break ? So what are we looking for ? The bunker would have been at the lowest point . Anything structural . Be careful . She 's lucky to have you . Leadership is a lonely pursuit , but you ... you keep her centered . You got it backwards . Still blaming yourself for killing that army . You made mistakes ... it 's true ... but your intentions were pure . Every choice you made , you made to save your people ... even shooting me twice . As long as that 's the truth , you don 't need redemption . - You better hope so . - What 's that ? Well , if you 're wrong and there is a hell , then I guess I 'll see you there . How many people do you have to save before you forgive yourself ? Over here . Stay behind me . Watch your head . Ok . " From the ashes , we will rise . " Not this guy . The 11th seal . Their faith was based on 12 seals . Followers could level up by unlocking them one at a time . Only those who reached level 12 could achieve salvation . Maybe that 's why they didn 't let him in . I was right . What if they 're still in here ? Hey ! Is anyone there ? It 's still sealed . There 's no locks , no handles . That 's because it was designed to be opened from inside . Or from the outside by somebody with a Rover . What happened ? Let 's go find out . It worked . This can 't be . It wasn 't sealed . The radiation would have killed them in days . This won 't save anyone . Leave us . He was one of the looters . You were wrong about the Flamekeeper . And the Flame ? Destroyed before I could kill him . I 'm sorry . It 'll be more dangerous now . More people will have to die to keep me in power , not that that bothers you , Skairipa . People fell in line behind the Flame . Now they 'll fall in line behind the sword . Let 's hope Clarke finds a way to save us before they have to . Get out . Oh , finally . Emori . John , what 's wrong ? It looks like we may need my people , after all . There 's a storm coming . When it hits , we need to be on the right side of that door . So we make ourselves useful . Yeah . Yeah , exactly . I 've already started working on Abby . Come on . I 'll explain on the way . If I 'm on that list , you 're on that list . - Bellamy , I can 't . - Write it down . Write it down , or I will . So what now ? Now we put it away and hope we never have to use it . You still have hope ? We still breathing ? Get some sleep . Luna ? Impossible . We didn 't treat her . Your fever 's down . How ? Her body 's rejecting the radiation on its own . Here . Please sit down . I 'd like to run some tests . Jackson . What did you do ? Nothing . There 's only one variable . There 's one thing that separates Luna from the others . Nightblood . From the ashes , we will rise .

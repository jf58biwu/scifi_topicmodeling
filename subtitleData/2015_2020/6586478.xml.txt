 Are we out of gas ? You got to be kidding me ! This cannot be how this ends . No ! Steven ? Steve ? Steve ? Vince , listen , I 'm right in the middle of something here , man . What ? The book ? I thought you 'd be done already . Yeah , yeah , so did I , and the deadline 's coming . So could you just please ... ? You haven 't been on the blogosphere in the last few hours , have you ? No , Vince , I 'm ... I 'm writing and I 'm unplugged . Something 's going on , man . Crazy stuff in the ether . Yeah , well , I think the ether 's just gonna have to wait , Vince , because ... Wait ? What ? No . People are freaking out , man . Doppler maps and stuff aren 't working . Some crazy frequency is being picked up by the space stations . Do you know there 's a school of dolphins Off the coast of Baja California ... They all beached themselves . Vince , it 's called a 24-hour news cycle . Please , I 've got a lot I got to still do and ... and I 've got my call to make . Oh , yeah , the girls . Yes , Vince . You 're still married , huh ? Very funny . All this has made me so shaky . I got low blood sugar . I 'm gonna just grab me a snack . No ! Vince , go home . Don 't ... do ... This find is a phantom . Look at the density calculations . They 're all over the place . There cannot be this much natural gas in one area . You are funny . We should be drilling 600 miles south near the stratovolcano plate . Nancy , your data predicts A 260-trillion-cubic-foot natural gas find . Of course it 's gonna be a mistake . Yeah , that 's a mistake , right ? There it is , the daily call . Say hi to Rachel . And Steve . I will . Don 't go far . This won 't take long . I 'm right here . God , where are the other two ? We 're so late . We 're gonna be so far back , we 're probably not even gonna hear anything . Are you gonna complain or are you gonna help us pack up the car ? I will . As soon as I get off my call . You 're not on a call . But I am now . I 'm almost finished and I think it 's pretty good . Great . How does it end ? Is it happy ? Happy endings are so 1990s , sweetheart . Not true , Dad . Everyone likes a happy ending . Maybe in movies , but , Rachel , hey , I thought it was a concert you were going to . How come you are in a motel ? Dad , it 's not just a concert , it 's Life Rock Music Festival . It 's like a whole weekend band thing . Basically a stress reliever before finals . You should be stressed before finals . You should be studying before finals . Relief comes after . Hey , listen , speaking of after , We are not going to have Thanksgiving with Auntie Kathy . They can 't make it , so it 's just gonna be us turkeys . Yeah , um , about that . Allie kind of invited me skiing with her family so ... Uh , come to think of it , uh , baby , um ... It 's gonna be tough for me , too . No , there 's nothing tough about Thanksgiving . The only thing tough about Thanksgiving , Nancy , Will be the turkey if I have to cook it . I 'm gonna be here six more months . Nancy . Listen , I 'm not thrilled about it either , believe me , I 'm not . But just think of it this way ... The quicker I finish here , The quicker I can come back And I 'm gonna be there through a long stretch through Christmas . I know , but something always changes . That 'll change , you know , and we just ... It seems like we never spend any time together anymore . So is that a yes on me skiing with Allie ? Nan ... Do you feel that ? It 's an earthquake , amigo . That 's no earthquake . It 's a sonic boom . See ? See ? I told you . Shut up for a second , would you ? What the hell was that ? I ... What was that ? Sounded like an accident . Come on , somebody might be hurt . Oh , my God . Run , run , run . Oh , my God ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Craig ! Craig , come on ! Oh , my God . The storm is moving away . You sure ? Yeah . Yeah . I can 't get a damn thing on this . Just let it be , Vince . Oh , no , no , no . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . No . Come on , come on , not now , please . Are you sure we 're out of gas ? Why don 't you turn that alarm off , Steve ? You know why , Vince . Because I 'm never gonna give up . Not as long as there 's still a chance . Vince ! Vince ! There 's a gas station up the road . How do you know that ? The map told me . Maybe they have some gas left . We can push this thing . Get behind the wheel . Hey , hey . We 're gonna find them , Steve . All right , let 's go . Are you pushing ? Yeah . It 'd just be better if it was on a downhill slope . Go ! Can we stop for a second ? For what ? I 'm so tired . I know . We all are . But we don 't have any other choice . We got to keep moving , or we 'll never get there . We 're never gonna get there because you took us Off of a main road because of your internal male compass . We are heading west , which is where we need to be going . That is not a compass thing . That 's a fact . All right . Can we just chill out , please ? I 'm starting to think we made the wrong move . We know nothing about this place . We should 've stayed where we were , Waited for help to come to us . And end up like Craig ? Or worse ? Nobody came . Our only options are to stay out In the middle of nowhere and die , Or we make some attempt to get ourselves to safety . Allie ... Allie , don 't do that . Sorry . Allie , you can 't keep drinking all the water . I 'm thirsty . I 'm so thirsty . We all are , but we need to try and conserve it . Look . Looks like a nuclear cloud . You think that 's what happened ? Nuclear war ? Somebody tried to bomb us ? I wouldn 't rule it out . Let 's just keep moving . Another BS meeting with no answers . I can 't believe they 're keeping us here . We 're like prisoners . I 'm sure it 's for our own good . Ladies and gentlemen , my name is Philip Keeley And I 've been placed in charge of all northwest sector Natural resource operations . What 's happening ? No one 's telling us anything . Let me be clear . Two weeks ago , the Earth was like this . Now it 's like this . Is that clear ? A rogue planet traveling at 300,000 miles an hour Had a near miss with planet Earth . The rogue planet 's size , speed , and mass Acted like a huge intergalactic magnet , Flipping the Earth , Knocking us out of orbit , and is pulling us in its wake . I repeat ... Pulling us in its wake . Now , I 'm gonna give you all a few moments to think about that , Cause Lord knows I needed a few myself . So the universe has just served us up An enormous crap sandwich And we 're all still trying to choke it down . Half of the Earth is stuck facing the sun . The other half is in total darkness . That 's what 's been causing all these storms that we 've been seeing . The future is a complete unknown , But trust me , You will all be briefed as soon as I am . They said they would give us updates on our families . We have loved ones out there . Yes , and we are still working on it . Databases are being compiled , records are being sorted through , But the casualties are in the millions . When can we go home ? Los Angeles has suffered tremendous damage . Both coasts have . Listen , we all need to get used to this fact ... Normal life on this planet Ended two weeks ago . Consequently , everything on this continent , Every natural resource , every gallon of oil , Every ounce of gold , every fossil fuel Is our nation 's blood , And our future depends on it . And that means our future depends on you . We all carry a burden here . Let 's just carry it together . I 'm sorry , but I have a husband and a child out there And I 'm not just gonna sit idly by . I understand , but , ma 'am , right now you don 't have a choice . Mason . Sir ? Let her go . You can all be frustrated . You can yell and scream help . [ chuckles ] I 'll even let you punch me . But right now I am helpless To make this nightmare go away . Go , go , go ! Go , Vince go ! Harder ! I got it ! A little further ! All right , all right , all right ! Hold it . Hello ! Hello . Pumps are off . What ? The pumps are off . Hey , listen , I worked at a gas station in high school . You pump . All right . Anything ? Nah ! I got nothing ! Try number three ! Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah ! Good ! Yeah ! Yes ! Still no phone signal . Does that surprise you ? No . Speak Chinese ? No . I don 't speak Chinese . Uh , Steven ? What ? It 's coming right at us . Let 's get out of here . Let 's move , come on ! Move , we got to go . Let 's move ! All right , hit it ! Oh , my God , look at this thing . We got to get out of here . Hang on . You got to step on it , will you ? ! I am ! Damn it . I just can 't believe this is really happening . Well , it 's happening . They locked me out of my files . Why is this even important ? It 's my work . They 've renamed them Operation SAFE . Operation SAFE . Why would they rename my files ? Look , none of this really matters anymore . I 'm so tired of people telling me What 's important and what isn 't . All right , I 'm sorry . I just ... What are you doing ? I 'm leaving . You really think they 're gonna let you leave ? Well , they can try to stop me . They have guns . I don 't think they 're playing around . I 'm not playing around either . Well , how far do you think you 're gonna get ? They 've closed all the roads . The two most important people in my life are out there lost . Do you get that ? I 'm not gonna just sit around and do nothing . Do you know what 's going on out there ? Los Angeles is gone , Nancy . My daughter wasn 't in Los Angeles . What if one of those storms whips up ? I 'm not gonna just sit around and do nothing . You understand that , don 't you ? Fine , then I 'm coming with you . No , you are not . Yes , I am . You are not . Absolutely not . Yes , I am . You are not going out there alone . I wouldn 't be able to live with myself if I let that happen . I 'm serious . You just tell me how you 're planning on getting out of here Because they really don 't want us to leave . Did I mention they have guns ? You all right , Vince ? You okay ? Yeah . I think I cracked a rib . You 're lucky if that 's all you got , man . No kidding . Hey , you 're bleeding . I 'm fine . Well , whatever happened to our little planet , it 's getting worse . You got that right . Well , you don 't think this is a nuclear exchange , do you ? Nuclear , Vince ? Yeah . Nuclear ? You know , I once read a book about the Earth flipping on its side . There 's some people who still believe That that 's what killed off the dinosaurs , not a meteorite . I never heard that . Yeah , well . You think that 's what really happened ? You 're far out , man , way out . But it was something big , huh ? You know , something global . Something catastrophic . This planet , along with all the people That are still left on it , have just entered a new age . Look , all I know is our only means of transportation is gone ! What 's that ? It 's a flyer for that music festival thing . Yeah , this is that farm Or the field , wherever the hell they were gonna be . It 's gonna be someplace close to this , Vince . Whatever happened to stadiums and amphitheaters ? That was the place to be . Guess you 're just not cool enough , Vince . You know , I remember we played this 92,000 big old rock fest . We 're rocking out . We were ... we were so ... Vince , Vince . Really ? Let 's go . Wait , wait , wait . My whole life 's in my van . It 's not like anyone 's gonna take it . All right . Hold on , was that an insult ? Matt , we should have never left that road . Rachel , just calm down . Calm down ? There is no cover out here . If there 's another storm , we 're sitting ducks . We shouldn 't have done this . Do you want to turn back ? Guys ... We have no other options . I need another break . We should have gone home . And what if there 's no home to go back to ? You heard the same thing back at the hotel as I did . LA is practically gone . You don 't know that for sure . Rach ... You 're right , I don 't . We don 't know anything at this point . We can only hope that the intel we got is correct , That Safe Haven is a safe zone . Oh , you mean for rich people or government officials ? I need some more water . What if they don 't even let us in ? We are American citizens . I just ... Guys , that 's all the water we had ! Allie did it . Allie . Allie ? Allie , oh , my God . Allie , are you okay ? She 's dehydrated . You think ? Matt , look . Maybe they have water or something . Wait . Come on . Come on . You think they 're dangerous ? I don 't think we should trust anyone right now , Especially not people with guns . Guns ? Come on . Oh , God , I hope they didn 't hear me . Hey , Vince , this is it . This is the place . Yeah . You know , it was a long shot , Steve . I know . I know , I was just hoping . Maybe it 's better that no one 's here . Where 'd they go ? Maybe they went home . Vince , come on . I 'm just saying . Maybe if they lived in Denver or the Midwest , But I 'm sure the word spread about what happened at the coast . They 're just kids . They don 't know nothing . It 's coming this way . No , I think now it 's moving away . Until the next one . What is that ? " Safe Haven . " Sounds great . Sign me up . Is it a phone number ? No , it 's a sequence like the ones at the gas station . What one at the gas station ? Never mind . It 's a phone number . This is a radio station , lotto super jackpot . Safe Haven . That 's ... This means something . These numbers mean something . You think this is a coded message ? I don 't know , maybe . I got an uncoded message for you . There 's nobody here but us and there 's no way out of here . Hey . Maybe there 's something at that farm we can borrow . You mean like a horse ? Beats walking . I hate horses . I don 't care . I got kicked in the head once . Move ! Move ! [ siren wailing ] So much for your plan . Yeah , I 'm not ready to scrap it yet . Go left . Come on . Come on . You think this is a good idea ? Well , if you don 't want to come , you can turn back around . But this is my chance to make a break for it . I think this is your chance to get yourself killed . I 'm aware of that . Okay . Get in . Hey ! Is there anyone out here ? Shh . I think they 're gone . Whoa , whoa , whoa , hey , hey . I ain 't gonna hurt you . Here , look . It 's for protection , that 's all . Looks like you all need a drink . Allie . No , go on ahead . We have enough to share . Easy , easy . So , um ... Do you guys know what 's going on ? What 's happening ? Damn apocalypse , that 's what 's going on . Fire and brimstone , the whole nine yards . It 's fun , ain 't it ? Where you guys headed ? Who says we 're headed anywhere ? Well , I know you aren 't setting up camp out here . Safe Haven ? That 's right . Where 'd you get that ? A bunch of people at a concert we were stranded at . Apparently some computer hackers Gained access to some top-secret information . They were spreading the word . Well , looks like we 're all moving on the same information . You know about it ? That 's right . Government thinks they 're gonna decide who lives or dies . Not on our watch . Safety in numbers . We 'll go together . Besides , y 'all don 't look like you 're doing so good by yourselves . Let 's go . Come on . Yeah , come on . This is the Earth moving through space and fast . As you know , we have literally been pulled out of orbit . We believe that even at a greater distance , The Earth can sustain life . It is believed that this area , as we have highlighted , Is the livable zone . Anything outside this , And our planet will be too cold to sustain human life . As of right now , we are gathering information As to how long the Earth will continue its progression . We are holding out hope That the sun 's gravity will negate this pull effect At some point and hold us within the livable zone . But right now we have a much more pressing issue . We are closing in on the asteroid belt . The chances that the Earth will sustain An extinction-inducing blow Are hovering at about 85 % . This is why we have enacted Operation SAFE . God . Oh , man . Hello ! Hello ! Is anybody home ? I don 't think anybody 's home , Steve . What gave you that idea , Vince ? I don 't think the keys are in it . You 're all heart , man . What do you want me to do ? I can 't do anything about that . Do you want to find your family or not ? Maybe we should just knock on the door first . That 's what I was ... Oh , yeah , let 's knock on the door Of a farm in the middle of the apocalypse . Hello ? Hey , help us , please ! Our car hit your cow and we need transpo ! No one 's home . They took off like everyone else with half a brain . Hey , let 's hotwire this thing and get out of here . Ah , here it is . Can you please stop ? Just it 's giving me a headache . I 'm just trying to find something , anything . Besides , you 're not saying much . I 'm thinking . I 'm just thinking . I think if I close my eyes and open them , Then everything will be back to normal , but that 's not gonna happen , is it ? Where are we headed anyway ? Long Hills . There 's some music festival , some concert that my daughter was at . Last I spoke to her anyway . That 's pretty far . I 'm not sure we 're gonna have enough gas to get there . Well , we 're gonna have to stop . Considering everything that 's been said over the past two weeks , I don 't think that 's a viable option . We 'll know soon enough , right ? Why are you here ? Don 't give me that BS about " I couldn 't live with myself . " It 's not BS . I don 't have a family . You 're my family . Wish there was some coffee around here . Ow . Ow ! Have you done this before , Vince ? Yeah , a few times . How few ? Can I get some quiet ? I 'm trying to focus . Sorry . I didn 't realize you were such a ... isn 't it just two wires ? What in God 's name you think you 're doing ? ! Get the hell out of my truck ! " Don 't knock . There 's nobody home . " Shut it , both of you ! That 's my truck . We 're on a mission , man . Yeah , for what ? Rip off an old man ? No . Like the last group come through here , Took everything wasn 't nailed down ? ! Sorry to hear about that , sir . You two don 't appear much better . We didn 't think anybody was here And we 're just looking for my daughter . Did you , uh ... did know that person over there ? That was my wife . I 'm sorry , sir . We 're very sorry . She got caught out in one of them storms . I just , uh ... Just too afraid to move her , I guess . I haven 't spoken to my daughter in two weeks . I know she 's somewhere in the area , maybe alone , maybe scared . Maybe dead . Yeah , I thought about that . The last storm took our van , nearly killed both of us . What the ... Steve ? Sir , intel 's confirmed inbound meteors . How many are we talking ? They didn 't specify . Get everyone back down to the shelters on the double . Yes , sir . Damn it ! Here we go again . Move ! Come on ! Oh , God . Come on ! Go ! Get out ! Run ! Go ! Run ! Follow me . Follow you ? Where are we going ? This way . Let 's go ! I got a bomb shelter . Get down ! Come on . Matt ! My great-grandfather built it . I made some modifications . She 'll hold up to a lot . Not a direct hit from a global killer , though . These meteors are small potatoes . We get hit by a big one , boys , and its game over . What makes you say there 's gonna be more ? Well , just guessing the further we move out ... Wait , the further who moves out ? Us , the planet . Say what ? You two don 't know , do you ? I thought everybody pretty much knew by now . No , we 've been ... We 've been guessing . We 've been on the road since we evacuated LA . And the radios and the phones are useless . Well , what do you think is going on ? I don 't know . You two better sit down . You okay ? Yeah , you ? Oh , my God . Yeah . I think that went past . Yeah . Who knows how long until the next catastrophe ? Sooner rather than later , I think . Let 's get out of here . All right ? Yeah , let 's go . Think it 's gonna be okay ? It better . I think we should hole up here for a bit , Least till we find out if this thing 's over . What makes you think it 's gonna be over ? I can 't believe it . I just can 't . I know . Shh . It 's okay . We 're gonna be okay . Just stay positive and strong . But Matt , he was right there ! I know . I 'm really sorry about your friend . Could have been any one of us . Thousands of people have died , probably millions by now . It sucks . It 's the truth and it sucks . And we all have to deal with that . I just want to go home . Hey , there is no home . Home doesn 't exist . But our fair government , they found a safe place . The president and his staff and all the wealthy well-to-dos , They 're gonna get together and they 're gonna go there And they 're gonna figure this out . And when we can , we 're gonna go there , too . Then what are we still doing here ? Let 's go ! Let 's just go now . Because we all want to get there , right ? And not end up like your friend . Or my family . God rest their souls . Amen . I 'm sorry . Don 't worry about it . It is what it is . So this , uh , place , Do you think we 're just gonna be able to walk in ? I mean , they 're placing all these important people there , so ... No , we don 't suppose they 're gonna roll out Any red carpet for us , if that 's what you 're asking . No , they ain 't . Building 's been compromised ! We 've been ordered to evac To a mobile military command just outside the zone . What 's your clock at ? SOLDIER : T-minus 23 hours and counting , sir . We got to get out of here before we 're all buried alive ! Yes , sir . Come on , move . On the double ! Move ! Let 's move ! Move ! How do you know all this ? Told you , some of the stations were still reporting the info As it was coming in . Well , until it went dark , anyway . Holy mother of all things . Yeah . Holy ... I thought it was bad , but this is ... I couldn 't have written it worse than this . That 's where the storms are coming from . Earth 's moving faster now , right ? You got the jet stream knocked out of whack . You got half the planet baking in the sun And the other half freezing facing away . That 's what 's causing these superheated storms . And these super-frozen storms are moving at hurricane speed . It 's just beating the hell out of the planet And it 's not even our biggest problem , right ? No . And the two of you are out in the middle of it all Doing God knows what . I told you . I 'm looking for my daughter . Right , daughter . Right . Yeah , and you 're thinking you 're just gonna find her , like , what ? Like ... like magic ? No , we 're following her trail . She was here at that concert down on the farm . Yeah , those sons of B 's . They got some nerve pulling a stunt like that out of here , Ripping up the land , scaring the cattle . Well , I guess it ... Don 't matter much now . Do you know where they went ? No , can 't say that I do . I could hear a lot of commotion up there for a while though , And then it sounded like military trucks and helicopters came in . I think they rounded them up . Well , I can 't rightly say . Show him the flyer . Oh . What ? What 's that ? We 've been seeing a series of numbers spray-painted All over the place , storefronts , billboards . And then we found this at the concert site . Safe Haven ? Yeah , I know it 's a long shot , But we think maybe that 's a clue as to where they 've gone . Can you make anything out of those numbers ? Yeah , it 's coordinates . Of course . Are you sure ? How do you know that ? I take it neither of you two was ever in the military . Yeah . No . See , what you got here is two sets of numbers . You got 45.05 degrees north latitude And negative 104.2 degrees longitude . That would put it somewhere around here . So you mean it 's close ? Yeah , it ain 't on the other side of the world , that 's for sure . Yeah , I 'd say it 's close . Sir , I need to do this . I need to find my daughter and my wife , please . I 'll give you the truck . And I 'm guessing you 'll need provisions . But , uh ... I need you to help me with something first . Anything , anything , just name it . Yeah , anything . You okay ? Mm-hmm . We 're gonna make it . We 're gonna find Rachel . I don 't know . We are . We 're in this now . There 's no room for doubt , not for a second . Yeah , right . Why 'd they lock me out of my files ? What ? That bogus find , why 'd they take my files , Rename them , then put a clearance on them ? Nice segue . I don 't know . Maybe they weren 't bogus after all . That much gas ? Come on . Maybe . Why are you thinking about that now ? Because when I think about work , I tend to think about nothing else , And usually it 's a bad thing , but right now , It 's ... it 's a pretty great thing . It was a nice find . I hope it matters someday . Well , I sure want to thank you for that . Sure thing . All right , then the truck 's yours . The maps are in the glove box . There 's an extra tank of gas in the bed . You saved our lives . You 'd have done the same . Sure hope you find your daughter . Thank you . All right , then . You got the flyer ? We gonna talk about what 's going on ? What , about our planet being knocked out of orbit , Careening aimlessly through the solar system ? Yeah , that . No . Okay . Wait . What is it ? Oh , my God , is that the motel ? What motel ? What are you talking about ? This motel , it was my last call with Rachel . It was here . Hello ? Here 's the office . The office ! Nobody 's here . Where is everybody ? Oh , nobody 's here . Hello ? Hello ? It 's locked . Everything is dead . Everything is dead . Oh , my God , it 's like this everywhere ! Hey . How 's my daughter gonna survive ? Hey , hey , hey , calm down . How 's my daughter gonna survive ? She 's got a good head on her shoulders . You raised a good kid , that 's how . We 're gonna retrace her steps , And when we find her , she 's gonna be alive . You have to believe that . Allie ? Allie , hey . Yeah ? Do these guys make you ... uneasy ? They saved our lives . Yeah , but not Matt 's . What are you saying ? I don 't know . Did you sleep ? That 's why . You 're overtired , your brain is fried . They have guns . If they wanted something , they would have taken it by now . Yeah , I guess . Hope you got your rest . We 're moving out . Is it safe to go ? Not sure . I haven 't heard anything fall from the sky . No storms in a bit . We all know they 're coming back . Seems a good time as any . It feels safe here . Can 't we just stay here and wait for someone to find us ? For help to come ? Uh-uh , we 're leaving . And y 'all are coming . I don 't understand it . Let 's say it 's true . Let 's say there 's this one place designated as safe . Safe how ? Why ? It 's got to be a place that 's somewhere in the middle , right ? Yeah . Moderate temperature . Equidistant between these two extremes . And of course , it can 't be on a continental plate Because the seismic activity would just crumble it like the coast . Yeah , that makes sense . But what 's with the cryptic code ? Why not spread the word , get everyone there ? There 's only one reason for that , Vince . Think about it . The government doesn 't want 300 million people In a place that can only hold like 10 . I 'm sure it 's something like that . Oh . Of course , considering what 's been going on , I highly doubt that there 's 300 million of us left , Vince . Must have been hard for you . What 's that ? You know , burying that guy 's wife . I kept thinking about you and Nancy . No , no , Nancy 's fine . She 's alive . Yeah , she 's smart . She 's strong . She 's stronger than me . She 's in a government facility , So I 'm sure she 's ... she 's alive . Yeah , no , I just thought it was hard for you because , you know , You 're a writer . You just ... you do this all day , not used to shoveling . Yeah ? You know , because to shovel , you need these . Yeah . Yeah , get in the truck . Got something . That 's the music festival . Right . It says it 's just a few miles east of here . Yeah , okay , but that was two weeks ago . I mean , could they still even be there now ? Well , we 're gonna find out . You just said we would retrace our steps and follow our clues . That 's what you said . Yeah , absolutely . I was just hoping we 'd find something here first And then maybe jump a few steps ... There 's nothing here . We have to go . We got to get out of here . That doesn 't look good . If we 're gonna go , we should go now ! No ! Too dangerous . We should wait it out . Nancy , come on ! I don 't think you understand how cold this storm is . I think we can outrun it and keep moving . No . Let 's go . Go ! Come on ! Now ! Run ! Come on . Make sure you lock that . Help me . If the wind blows that window open , we 're dead . Help me with this . Help me , come on ! Yes . Can we at least slow down for a bit ? No . I don 't like when things are quiet . Things are never quiet for long these days . We need to make as much ground as we can while we can . You see what I mean ? Is that headed this way ? Hard to tell . Let 's keep moving . What 's that ? Trees ! Get in the trees ! What ? Why ? Do you think it 's gone ? I don 't know . What was that ? It was a military drone . Don 't you watch the news ? Why would they send it here ? Are they trying to track the storms ? Maybe . Or us . Us ? It means we 're getting closer . Closer to what ? Safe Haven . Yeah , and I reckon we 're not the only unwanted guests Trying to get there , if you know what I mean . Let 's go . If it 's US military , why are we hiding from them ? Let 's go , now ! Okay . Hold on . Okay . It 's coming . Here it comes . Hold on . Okay . Hold on . Got it . I got it ! Hold on . You got it . Get ready ! Hold on ! No ! What do you think these signs mean ? Very funny . Yet you 're still driving through . I 'm not gonna stop until someone tells me to stop . Maps says the coordinates are that way . You know , when I said the government Doesn 't want a lot of people here , Seems like they don 't want anybody here . Not without permission at least , no . Did you not see the signs ? Maybe we should ask him for directions . Let me do the talking . Did you not see the signs ? I 'm sorry . I 'm looking for someone . Well , you 're looking in the wrong place . No one 's here . No , no , I understand , But I think my daughter came here . Like I said , no one 's here . Now I 'm gonna have to ask you to turn this vehicle around . This is Safe Haven , right ? This is a restricted area and I am losing my patience . Okay , it 's cool . Sure is a fine mess we 've got ourselves into . You got that right , sir . I heard you barely made it out . Damn lucky . Have you been able to establish a perimeter ? We 're working on it . But tell someone they can 't be somewhere , It 's the first place they want to go . We 're doing our best . How about that briefing with the president ? Sir , if you walk this way , we 'll get you up to speed . Sir , the storms are getting worse . As long as the Earth is spinning on its side like this , It 's just gonna keep happening . And our position ? Not pretty . Pull that up for us ? We 're not slowing down . Operations SAFE is prepped and ready . We 're just awaiting the president 's go-ahead . National Guard has a perimeter established , which hasn 't been easy . Also , flying drones round the clock To try to gather any civilians . The president can give his order at any time after that . I take it we are set to evac ? We started on that already , sir . Good job . This is it . This is the border . Looks quiet enough . Are you guys sure we should be doing this ? Yeah . Do you hear that ? We need to get to cover . Wait . What ? I just ... I don 't understand Why we 're running from the Army . It doesn 't make sense . It just doesn 't feel right . Ladies , let 's go ! You 've picked up others . Is there a list of the civilians somewhere That you 've picked up that have come through here ? Hey , hey . Is there a list ? This is a complete and absolute Violation of my rights , man . I know people ! I mean , real people ! Not just , you know ... Politically connected people ! Hey ! Don 't push me , man ! You know I 'm saying ? I know people ! Oh , great . This is just great . Hey ! Hey ! You can 't hold us here forever . I don 't think they care , Vince . We 're not terrorists ! We 're dealing with martial law here . It 's either their way or the highway . No , no . Hey , hey , hey , hey . We didn 't come this far to be stopped now . We didn 't come this far to get a rifle shoved up our butts . You just sit down for a second And give me some time to think , please ? You are not using guns on US soldiers ! We will do whatever we need to do to survive . Well , I 'm not gonna be a part of that . Help ! Help us ! Help us ! Help , please . We 're here ! Why ? Ah , Mrs. Lannon . I was happy to know that you were here And that you 're alive and well . Whoa , whoa , whoa , no . Are you sure you should be doing that ? It 's fine . Okay . Tony ... The guy that I was with ? Where am I ? You 're in a mobile military unit And the front line to what will either will be The beginning of the end of this disaster Or the beginning of the end of our planet . That 's great . Now you see why I didn 't let you out there Looking for your daughter . No . I 'm so very sorry , Nancy . The alarms . Sir ? Do we really need the alarms ? Can 't we just all assume that it 's very bad all the time now And shut the alarms off ? Sir , one of our recon drones picked up a massive storm Moving towards this entire area . If you 'll excuse me . Be safe . SAFE . What 's that ? Operation S-A-F-E . SAFE . Why did you take my files ? Why 'd you rename them and then lock me out ? Oh , no , it wasn 't me . No , we all follow orders here . But I can say this . Your find , Nancy Lannon ... Is going to save the world . Well , we hope so anyway . How ? And that 's the part that 's classified . God be with you and your family . Think these guys are here to help you ? Think they 're your friends ? We 're your friends . You be dead without us . How could you do this ? How could we do this ? Call it survival instinct . We don 't want to die . Once you realize that your government doesn 't care about you , That freedom and equality are myths perpetrated upon us Under the disguise of democracy ... Then ... Then you 'll know the truth . Hell , they 'd just round us up like cattle , Send us to some military camp or some crap like that , Treat us like mules . We 're close here . We 're close to safety and we 're close to freedom . Now let 's go ! No . I said let 's go ! We 're not going anywhere with you guys . We 're not asking you . We 're telling you . Move . Now ! These things are getting closer . Move it . I 'm ready , you son of a bitch . Repeat , this is not a drill . Attention , storms approaching . ETA 90 minutes . I repeat , this is not a drill . I got to tell you , I didn 't think it 'd end like this . Like what ? I don 't know , just sitting here Waiting for God knows what . What 'd you expect ? Happier ending , I guess . Happy endings are so 1990s , Vince . Oh , okay , writer man . How 's this supposed to go down ? Actually , I have no idea . Steve Lannon , author extraordinaire , has no idea ? I 'm gonna stop buying your books . You never bought them , Vince . I gave them to you . I 'm gonna stop reading them , for sure . Get in line . I didn 't think you could read . Is your name Steve Lannon ? Yeah . Of 4255 Vantage Avenue Sunnyvale , California ? Yes , why ? Can you come with me , please ? Sure . You can stay , sir . The plot thickens . Steven ! Steven . Nancy ! Steven . Steven . Oh , my God . I thought I 'd lost you . How did you get here ? Are you okay ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I was looking for Rachel . So am I. That 's why I 'm here . Do you know where she is ? Do you have any information ? Apparently in the chaos , some underground movement Spread the word about a location , A safe haven from the disasters . They think that the government is keeping this location hidden Just for the elite , the privileged few . If Rachel is still alive , I think that 's where she 'd try to get to . Yeah , definitely . Definitely . Sir . We just got word of an exchange of gunfire by the border . Two of our National Guardsmen are down . Would you like to send a team to take care of it ? No . Send a drone . I want to see exactly what we 're working with . Yes , sir . You are animals . Disgusting animals . Hey , shut it ! What are you gonna do , hit me ? Allie . What ? Look around . We are the stupidest people on Earth ! What are we doing ? Hey ! We 're alive . And right now , that counts for everything . All I see are two murdering kidnappers That disgust me . Go check it out . Stay . These are the suspects From the shooting at the border . We have an ID on any of them ? No , sir . We think that they think this area Will provide them sanctuary . Guess it doesn 't matter . They had their warnings . Yes , sir . Where are the sirens ? Incoming ! Take cover ! Incoming ! Take cover ! That 's better . Sir , we have an incoming call From the president on the secure line . I guess he 's done waiting . Start to move everyone out of here . Airlift should be here in 30 . Sir , yes , sir . Whoa , whoa . Out ! Out ! Front row seats to the end of the world , huh ? Hopefully , we 'll be gone by then . Vince , what are you doing here ? I forgot to tell you . Vince came with me . Hey , Nance . Hey , Vin . Hi . I thought you hated me ? I do . You know , if the man in tights were here , He 'd circle the planet a million times and turn back time . If I were him , I 'd push the planet back into orbit . Push the planet back . What ? That 's is what they weren 't telling me . That 's why they stole my files . About what ? Oh , God . We are a go for Operation SAFE . I repeat . We are a go for Operation S-A-F-E . What 's Operation SAFE ? What are you doing here ? At ease . You 're gonna blow it , aren 't you ? The eight nuclear nations Are sending a combined 500 kilotons of nuclear weapons To the coordinates on that wall . The combined effect will not only detonate , But it will ignite the single largest Natural gas reservoir on this planet . Your reserve . This rogue planet has taken us for a ride And it 's time for us to end it . So those coordinates , that 's not a safe haven ? That 's right . Operation SAFE is no safe haven . Hackers intercepted the international communiqué As the plan was being developed . They botched it . Half the reason we have troops here at all Is to clean up that mess . Am I crazy or is that Rachel ? Hey , what is that ? Where was this taken ? Make yourselves comfortable . We 're gonna be here a while . What are you guys gonna do with us ? You ain 't figured it out yet ? We 're starting over . Whole world 's starting over . He and I are starting over with you . Yeah , right . Uh-uh-uh ! Let go of me ! Get off of me ! Let go ! Don 't even think about it , sweetheart . Oh , God , that 's her . She 's alive . [ siren wails ] I 'm going to get our daughter . Mrs. Lannon ! Mrs. Lannon ! Mrs. Lannon , I can 't let you make this decision . My daughter is out there . She 's being held hostage ! You need to get some guys to go get her . I can 't do that . An executive order has been given . This is the point of no return . She 's still alive . She 's out there ! There is no way to get anyone out in time . And right now I can 't risk anyone 's life . No one is going back into the zone . We 're not talking about anyone . We 're talking about me . Let me go . Give me a truck . Give us a truck . Excuse me ? I would rather die knowing that I tried to save my daughter Than be alive knowing that I didn 't . The storm . We 're running out of time . Come on , we got to go . Listen , these guys are armed and dangerous . You 're gonna need guns . A GPS tracker will help you pinpoint their exact location , But the rest is on you . You got about two hours Before all hell is unleashed on your heads . I hope you find her . Godspeed . Can I go ? No . No . Yeah . Sorry . She hates me . She really hates me . We 're getting closer . We 're almost there . Look out ! Brace yourself ! Hold on ! Hold on ! It 's getting worse . There is no safe haven . We 're all gonna die . Does that thought scare you ? I kind of find it liberating . There it is . What 's the plan ? I don 't know . I 'm writing this as I go along . Write a good one . I can tell I don 't like this one already . Go check it out . So what 's going to happen to them ? How are they supposed to get out ? Fortunately , it 's not my problem . Carl ! We got company ! What do they want ? Military ! They 're just sitting there . Think we 're surrounded ? This area has been designated for a military strike . A mandatory evacuation has been ordered . Come out with your hands up And you will be taken to safety . What ? That sounds like my dad . Lies ! They 're all lies ! We ain 't leaving ! Put your damn gun down ! Yeah , but they ain 't shooting ! What , are you crazy ? Something ain 't right . They ain 't doing nothing ! Dad ? Mike . Carl ! They have nukes headed here now . They 're gonna blow this place sky-high . We don 't have any time . Put your damn gun down . Nuke this place ? Don 't make no sense . You ain 't military . You can 't even hold a gun proper . Carl ! You ain 't never hold a gun in your life . I 'm not military . And I 'm not lying . The only lie was that this is a safe haven . They 're gonna blow about 1,000 square miles of this place To try to save the planet And right now you are wasting valuable time . Carl ! Dad ! Carl ! No . How 's this , huh ? Don 't move . Do it . Don 't even think about it . He doesn 't have to think about it . I will . What do you want to do with these guys ? Where are we going ? As far as away from this place as we can ! It can 't be far enough . They ain 't gonna nuke this place , right ? No . No one nukes their own country . You got to be kidding me ! God ! Is this for real ? We were never gonna make it anyway . We tried . At least we tried . No . This cannot be how this ends . No ! I have a visual . There they are ! Let 's move . We got to get them out of there . Roger . You hear that ? Told you they wouldn 't leave us . What made you change your mind ? Well , let 's just say It was the right thing to do . Listen , I 'm glad you 're all okay , But we 're not out of this yet . We have incoming at T-minus 20 , 19 , 18 ... Do we have distance ? Not yet . No , sir . Five , four , Three , two , one . Stand by . Hold on ! Hold on ! Whoa ! When will we know if it worked ? It 's gonna work . It 's gonna work .

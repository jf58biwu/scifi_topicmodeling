 In co-production with CHANNEL ONE RUSSIA Supported by SAGA FILM STUDIO , TOR FILM PRODUCTION , METRANOM STUDIO With the financial support from Ministry of Culture of Russia With the financial support from Ukrainian State Film Agency " There is no such thing as line and modeling . A drawing is a relationship of contrasts or simply the relationship between black and white . " Paul Cezanne Under Electric Clouds We 've lived through different times . One era replaced another sending off sparks . Good or bad , those eras were part of our life . Countless days and nights . Snowy winters , brief thaws , heatwaves , melting snow . We entered each new era confused . Crucified between equally great past and future . It 's 2017 . 100 years after the Russian revolution . Everyone 's waiting for a great war . Globalization has not united the world . History is not over . Early Modern times are here again . Tough . With no simple solutions . We enter a new era armed with historical experience . But we don 't notice the musty jackets of our predecessors clinging to us . We can 't tell ourselves apart from them . But there have always been people who used to be called superfluous . Just people , no better or worse than the others . Others often dislike them and stick labels on them . Yet somehow nothing in this world happens without these people . Without them , there can be no picture of our world , our country , our time . This is a story about them . And about an unfinished building , which became a cornerstone in the lives of our characters . I saw this guy . I don 't think he knows that construction has stopped . He is so miserable , out of everything . And we 're so satisfied . It 's just awkward how miserable he is . Where 's your conscience ? It 's so cold . You 're such a pig . Take your coat off ! Mister ! Immigrant ! Wait ! Put this on . Stay with us . We 'll feed you . Chapter 1 . Foreign Speech Rashid ! How do we get to the station ? How do we get to the station ? - He can 't speak . - You can 't speak . The borders are on fire . It 's no time for construction . Your construction site 's closed . Go find another site ! He can 't speak . Look there ! Look up there ! It 's starting . For the first time . It 's magic . Understand ? It 's magic ! It used to be plain sky . And now there 's this . They say , Shanghai and Tokyo will have it too . It seems the future is here . No more ordinary lives the people used to live ... ( speaking Kyrgyz ) ( speaking Kyrgyz ) ( speaking Kyrgyz ) You can 't be here . What is this place ? A show or museum . Opening night . Why the music ? They had a party . They 're still partying . My stereo is down . Where can I get it fixed ? - I can 't speak . - I don 't know . If you don 't understand the language , smile . A woman got stabbed here . Make sure you always carry your ID . I lost my purse just now . I can 't find it . Too bad , it was a nice purse . What 's the situation in China ? A crisis ... What are the forecasts ? I thought so ... A crisis ... ( speaking Kyrgyz ) - ( speaking Kyrgyz ) - Sorry . I don 't get it . ( in Kyrgyz ) I need a shop to fix electronics . What do you need ? ( in Kyrgyz ) I need a shop to fix electronics . You need a shop that fixes electronics ? So just ask for an electronics repair shop . You need an electronics repair shop . I ... The first words are very hard . Just say it : " I need an electronics repair shop " . I need lectronic repairs . I need electronics repair shop . I speaks . Hi . I speaks ... I need an electronics repair shop . I speaks . ( speaking a foreign language ) I says . I talks . Chapter 2 . The Heirs You were abroad for four years ? And three more before that ? Yes . I went to school , then college . I wanted to go to Istanbul but I didn 't . My father died . We came to take care of things . Go ahead , please . - Hello . - Hello . Why didn 't anyone come to get us ? The walls are so damp . The roof is leaking . Where 's everyone ? Valera , Marina ... The gardener , what was his name ? Sasha . We never opened the house ourselves . The guards or someone else always did it . I read that scientists discovered that all our feelings are just chemicals . I think that 's nonsense . - It 's not true , is it ? - It 's not nonsense . - Did you hear the door ? - No . The robot 's broken . Sasha ! My darling ! Poor , lonely girl . My little girl . Life 's so unfair sometimes . There 's no explaining it . You just have to try to accept it . But acceptance is impossible . My dear little angel . I 'm so scared and in pain , too . There 's no death , don 't think of it . Your Dad 's just somewhere incredibly far away . But he 's still with you . And he loves you . I am sorry . I couldn 't come to the airport . I was busy . There 's nobody around here . Dad just fell asleep and died . It was only us at the cemetery . Nobody came . When he was alive , people came . Why ? It used to be different . We had parties . Musicians came from abroad . Probably because Dad used to have tons of money . It 's okay . Go ahead and cry . When we take care of the inheritance you 'll be rich and free . - Hi . - Hi , Uncle Boris . The roof 's leaking . I wanted to go to Istanbul . They treat you different if you 're a foreigner . Why is it different everywhere else ? Where 's everyone ? - Valera , Marina ? - They all left . Servants are like that . Useless people . - It 's cold here . - Stop complaining . You 're always cold . Your Dad was cut of stone . He made huge money . In 20 years , he almost became a God . No matter what , he always won . And you 're an airhead . Look , it 's working again . Sasha , let 's play for a Coke . - Do you know where we keep the sheets ? - No . Military trucks keep coming . I found this bag . Dad gave it to me , look . Sasha , let 's travel . We 'll keep going . We 'll see people , countries , and cities . We 're right to sell everything . Assets , liabilities . We 'll be free and rich . I 'll buy penthouses in New York , Paris , and Mumbai . Maybe I 'll hold a contest to help young writers . Why is Uncle Boris so disrespectful to me ? I can 't understand stupidity . I don 't want to listen to you . And I won 't . You can talk all you want . I won 't hear . You 're a big , immature boy . Though my brother . You 're like some cyborg from " Fallout " . - With that hearing aid , too . - These light bulbs . They are a real cataclysm ... Danya ! Sweetie ! My little baby ! You sweet thing ! Get up . Let 's go . My poor baby ! Please get up ! Let 's go ! Let 's go home . Don 't leave me . Get up . Get up . Please , get up . My dear , get up . Let 's go home . Let 's go , sweetie , I 'll feed you . Come on , darling , let 's go . Please . Let 's go , baby . Danya ... Danya ! Look , your feet are wet . I wonder who designed this beautiful building . Is that bag heavy ? I 'll put it in the car . - It was a gift from Dad . - Sasha . Just say thank you . And confirm that we 'll sign and review everything when we come into the inheritance . I can 't remember the name of this company Dad owned . I should be ashamed , right ? - Uncle Boris . - I 'm unhappy , too . The Japanese are ready to buy the land . They 'll destroy the building to make it simple . Let them make it simple . But it 's a pity . It seems broken and not broken . Dad liked it . - Meet my wife , Angelica . - Angelica von Goering . It 's a contemporary building , isn 't it ? I 'm creative , too . A painter and photographer . I follow the style of Caravaggio ... - Style of Brodsky and Caravaggio . - And Brodsky . I see no artistic or functional value in this . I am sorry about your loss ... But this is emotional to the point of bad taste . What is the point then ? Of course , it 's sad ... You think it 's important but it is not . This building is just a monument to the ambitions of two follies . That of the architects and of your father . - It is sticking out . - Your nose is bleeding . - It 's ok . - Architecture must be functional . Sasha ! - Let 's have a school reunion . - Ok . And forget about functionality . When they stopped construction , the architect wanted to set himself on fire . But the wet matches didn 't light . What a fool . I am an expert and I always opposed this . The architect was probably weird . Like all talented people . Your father spent his huge fortune unwisely . I want to build an animal shelter . This blood is ridiculous . It must be the grief . Uncle Boris . Let 's not sell anything . Let 's just not do it . I don 't want to listen to you either . ( speaking Japanese ) We 'll sign a contract in the near future . ( speaking Japanese ) Meet Alexandra Fyodorovna . Panasonic-Kurosawa-harakiri-sushi ! You know , I 'm thinking of becoming a writer . I 'll stroll down 5th Avenue and make up stories . Maybe sci-fi , or cyberpunk . Have you read American Gods ? - Or I 'll give grants to young writers . - Why New York ? Tolstoy didn 't get his visa . They told him : " No visa for you . We 're waiting for Danya . " He stayed in Russia . Out of despair he wrote War and Peace . Did you read it ? It 's an okay novel . Nobody came . It 's so sad . We called so many people but no one came . I opened my first factory . - A factory . - You commoner . The European social system has outlived itself . Capitalism must be capitalism . Marry Sasha . Nobody else would marry her . She 's too smart . I 'm not looking for an idiot . I 'll build a shelter . I don 't know what kind . For the miserable . Do you want to go to the river bank ? I 'll show you a cool spot . Remember you got scared of a hedgehog ? Let 's go ! It 's getting cold . It 's starting to snow . Sasha ! This was all studios 25 years ago . They were shut down . People took all they could . Only statues were left . I don 't know anyone here , except for Lenin . Winter 's arrived . It 's cold . Let 's go back home . It 's like Carthage or something ... These are some depressed statues . Wait , here 's an angry one . And this one 's happy . My earring just sank . In 1,000 years they 'll find it . Someone will write an article and get famous . Then he 'll have an affair with a grad student . - Is it gold ? - I don 't wear gold . I don 't like it . It 's cold here . - Hello . - Hello . I 'm investigating a criminal case against your father . He is accused of fraud under Article 159 ( 4 ) . - Hello . - Hello . I 'm Chief Investigator Prokopov . As part of an investigation of organized ... It feels awkward , of course , after this tragedy ... What a twist of fate , right ? You were so little the last time I saw you . And now look at you . - Would you like some tea ? - Yes , thank you . Wonderful tea . English lords have it every day . Dad was a good man . He built hospitals . Why is this happening ? You don 't know a thing about his business ? You can read this . It has all the facts . - What an interesting robot . - We 're investigating . - Your dad was almost a God . - The walls are damp . Now 's a different time . With different Gods . Ragnarok or something like that . You think your father built hospitals ... But what if that never happened ? You see the situation in the world . It 's almost war out there . The light bulb again . Nobody will defend you . Maybe we can help . A friendly effort . You have almost no time . Nobody will defend you . On the contrary . Your Dad had many enemies . If you have any info for me , just call . Funny . An architect of that building wanted to burn himself alive . But the matches were wet . Everyone laughs at that for some reason . Even if he wanted to do it , who cares ? Yesterday you said you 'd freeze our accounts . You left your number so I could call you . You said nothing my Dad did ever happened . But it really did . My brother and I remember . So it did happen . Regarding the rest of it ... Dad did his best to atone for his sins . He tried to come clean . Others never did . I will not leave . And I will not sell anything . Sasha ! Sasha . It 's all lies . They did it on purpose . I don 't believe it . It 's not true that Dad was a criminal . You 're right not to read it . Don 't . We 'll leave . It 'll all be in the past . With no money . We 'll rent a room in an attic . I 'll work , you 'll study . Damn them all ! You 're bleeding . What attic room ? How can we ? Tilt your head back . I 'll bring a tissue . I 've been calling Uncle Boris . Nobody 's picking up . Go to bed . You need some sleep . - Our roof is leaking . - There 's a noise outside . A noise right outside the window . Like some adversary is walking around . You just sleep . Hi , statue . Are you lonely , too ? Allez , hop ! Chapter 3 . Long Dreams of a Real Estate Lawyer Why do I keep having dreams about my past ? The CT and MRI don 't show anything , Marat . I 'm not sure what 's causing your weakness . There is no intracranial hematoma . Why the headaches ? It just happens . Why do I keep having the same dreams ? - About my youth . - Sorry . - About a city that doesn 't exist . - Yes ? And a world that doesn 't exist . It 's nonsense . I 'm fine . Except for these dreams . Why the nosebleeds ? By 1993 the Soviet republics will have stable economic growth . Two months ago , in November 1991 , we created a program and called for a national discussion . If those initiatives had been implemented ... Marat ! ... we would have avoided the tragedy . Marat , I bought this rare book for you . Printed in Finland . - It 's a very useful book . - Thank you . They will arrest Gorbachev and execute millions . It will rot for 20 years . Think about our boy . If a civil war starts , nobody will have time to leave . The supermarkets are empty . No food . Will you forget about it ? Who needs you there , in emigration ? You 'll teach math at school . Mom , can I go see Andrey ? No . You have to study for your entrance exams . Are you going to emigrate ? Nothing will happen . Go with me to America ! No . Anywhere but America ! - You 'll regret it . - I don 't think so . - Look , I 've got a terrible headache . - Really ? I 've got a lighter for you . No chance to play , eh ? Smells like something is burning . Hello . - Hi , Marat . - Hey there . Elly , stay ! What is this ? Grandma gave me this book . Don 't know why . It 's useless . - Someone leaving again ? - Yes , moving somewhere . Did you steal this in your mom 's kitchen ? Elly , let 's go ! - Looks like that movie spy . - You idiot ! I was trying to paint an icon . It 's called " Archangel Michael " . Elly , heel ! It still looks like that guy . - Elly ! - Hey , Big ! Hi , guys ! I just busted my pants . Stupid . David got this new gum from Japan . - It 's safe to swallow . - No way . Nice job on the painting . It looks a bit like the guy in that spy movie . It doesn 't . - Come with me ? - I have a German lesson now , I can 't . Are your parents planning to emigrate ? I am a terminator robot . Connection lost . You 're short-circuiting . Let 's go , Elly ! Elly , stay ! Elly ... Will you buy the book ? Grandma gave it to me . Sure , why not ? - Do you have the second Tolkien book ? - Not yet . - But you said it 's coming out soon . - Not yet . I have Heinlein and Burroughs . And Chronicles of Amber by Zelazny . Lots of new books come out every day . We didn 't have them before the Perestroika . - Do you have anything like Tolkien ? - Not here . I have Harry Harrison . - I can bring it if you want . - Please do . - Do you have Simenon ? - I 'll go get it . - Are you looking for Simenon , too ? - No . Are you Armenian or Jewish ? You 're not answering . What are you ? Me ? I am an elf . You don 't look like an elf . More like a Jew . Elves live in the Baltic States . My friend from Tallinn is an elf . Sorry I took you for a Jew . I don 't have anything against elves . They 're a respected people . We try not to interact with Jews . - So we live in forests . - Forests where ? Here . It 's Harry Harrison . - What about Simenon ? - Here 's a Simenon . - Thank you ! - You 're welcome . So no Jews in your family ? Your mom 's an elf , ok , what about your dad ? M. GORBACHEV : Dear compatriots , fellow citizens ! Due to the situation which has evolved with the Commonwealth of Independent States , I discontinue my work as President of the USSR . I make this decision based on principle . I firmly came out in favor of the independence of nations and sovereignty of republics . I support the preservation of the union and the integrity of this country . Developments took a different course . The policy prevailed of dismembering the country and the state , which I cannot subscribe to . After the Alma-Ata meeting and its decisions , my position did not change . Besides , it is my conviction ... Elly , let 's go . The dog 's so restless today . - Who 's this ? - This is my wife . See how everything is 25 years later . The country 's changed . I 'm married . No kids , though . What about me ? And Big ? You were murdered in ' 95 . For no reason . Then your mother died . Big went to Germany . I register properties for construction . I worked for a rich man for a while . Then I left . The man died . We were so nice . Actually ... Keep coming back , Marat . Nobody else sees me in their dreams . Nobody remembers me . Let 's go , Elly . Marat ! I 'm coming . Elly , stop . But I see you in my dreams . I come back here every night . Chapter 4 . Site for Development . 2011 Nikolay Mikhailovich ! There 's no power again . - There was a storm last night . - Ok . Summer is over . Something 's wrong all over the world . Ho Chi Minh City is flooded . Blogs say animals in the zoos are dying . The authorities say nothing . Last year , despite snowstorms , I prevented seven museum break-ins . - That makes me proud . - Good job . You can be proud . Lately I 've been feeling tiny . Like I 'm on my own palm , staring up . Maybe it 's your pancreas . - Do you like it ? - I don 't like your dissertation . Speculating on historical cycles . You 're a great scholar and culture expert . But you never reviewed it over the last year . The region gives out a single grant . We might not get it . The efforts will be wasted . Why do you always see the bad side of things ? I want what 's best . If you hate being a guide why did you learn all those languages ? I always wanted to work with tourists . By the way , I 've been thinking about Chatsky , Onegin , Pechorin ... They are all an artistic exaggeration , - fictional characters , right ? - Sure . ( speaking a foreign language ) Hi , girls . They brought a Chinese group . They promised a Japanese group from Okinawa . Will we manage ? See you at lunch then . ( speaking Chinese ) Hello . My name is Nikolay . I will tell you a story about this estate . Before going inside , I wanted to tell you about this park . - What do you want ? - Do you work in the circus ? No , I have a PhD . Go ! Above the window is the moon , And under it is the wind . The silver poplar lost its leaves It 's standing bare and light Two hundred years ago you 'd call me " Master " . And you 'd sing the Beatles at sunrise . Here you go . Hey , you should subscribe to my blog . I have a YouTube channel , too . Have you ever felt tiny ? Like you can fit on your own palm ? You just sit there , this small . The Chinese don 't buy anything . I know . They promised Japanese from Okinawa . The Japanese always buy everything . I want to buy a laptop . The latest 3D one . The bank won 't give me a loan . I don 't have enough cash . Why do we always talk about money ? Let 's chat after work . And take the interest . - Tonight ? - Yes . Thanks ! Got a smoke ? Is it interesting , driving a bus ? Taking people back and forth ? It is . You 're responsible for people , for their lives . Thank you ! Ah , the roads here . Impossible to drive . Yes . And no way to know where that veranda is . Do you know the veranda of the country club ? I don 't know , sorry . This fog is so weird . Looks like a cloud . - What time is it now ? - What ? - Do you know what time it is now ? - No , I don 't . But it 's late already . The wheel is stuck , we can 't get by . Let 's give it a push . Can you show us the way to the restaurant ? I don 't know . I 'm sorry . Do you work at the museum ? Yes . I explore Malevich and Petrov-Vodkin . Bathing of the Red Horse . - I don 't know why . - But it 's really very interesting . It is . You 're so real . It 's a good thing the road is bad here . Our city 's big and comfortable . But we don 't talk . They just play marches . I 'm not real . I 'm very ordinary . By the way , Malevich was a petty clerk . Then he quit everything and started a new life . I 'm sorry . Will you come to the restaurant with us ? Let 's go ! - We 'll talk about Malevich . - Thank you . - But I have a crazy day . - Are you sure ? I 've got tons to do tonight . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . I got something in the dissertation . But I can 't nail it yet . - But who needs it ? - I do . You live this petty life . You ask people for money , you bow to everyone . In a forest full of jackals I 've been appointed head mole or something . Come on ! it 's true ! Hello ! Don 't you recognize old friends ? How are you ? Everything ok ? Bye ! Listen , I want to buy a laptop . Latest model , 3D image . But I don 't have enough cash . Can you lend me at least some of it ? - Of course , I will . - Really ? Thanks ! - They can 't really speak English . - Of course . But we were taught right . We speak better than they do . You got some dirt here . - Can I see you for a second , Nikolay ? - Sure . I 'll be right back . How can I help you ? I want to introduce you . - This is a wonderful reporter . - Nice to meet you . - I 'm Nikolay . - And this is our hero . 20 years ago he threw himself under a tank to stop the Putsch at the White House . He 's a great scholar . He speaks Spanish , - Chinese , Vietnamese and Korean . - Oh , stop . - And other languages . - Thank you . Nikolay Mikhailovich ! In 1991 , you defended the White House . - Yes , I did . - Together with Yeltsin , you fought against the reaction , you covered a thousand miles to come to Moscow . You were an example for many ... Let 's go ! And now you fight for this historical meadow . - Why ? - Back in 1991 I ... I went there because it was a different time . I wanted to change something . I believed . So much time has passed . I don 't remember . Maybe I just went because my friends did . - Are you defending your museum ? - Of course ! My colleagues and I will defend it . Sure . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . We are here in this old field . They want to put up new buildings here . We have to fight so we don 't regret it later . We will go as far as a strike . Maybe even a hunger strike . - I agree . - It 's hard . Thank you . I knew it . You have never let me down . We must do it . You can lean only on something that resists . Have you seen young people driving sports cars ? Did they go by here ? - No , we haven 't . - Thanks . These roads ... Do you work in culture or in services ? I 'm a guaguero . It 's " a bus driver " in Spanish . That 's a respectable job for a man . I like it . - Have you ever tried anything else ? - No . - You didn 't want to ? - No . You don 't look like a bus driver . Are you lying ? I never lie . This is a beautiful Brazilian song ... You see . Malevich . Petrov-Vodkin . Bathing of the Red Horse . There 's this keen finesse . This perfection . The Japanese from Okinawa came yesterday . They commended me . In Japanese . Why am I the only one wearing the uniform here ? Stop mocking me . I really love you . We 'll live together and work in our museum . We 'll tell people stories about the past . Wonderful stories . Right ? There will be a big construction site here . The city needs to grow . One of you can be the new museum director . We need someone creative . Last year , despite snowstorms , I stopped seven museum break-ins . That makes me proud . The director is retiring . Our region doesn 't need conflicts right now . So I hope we can work together to take our museum to the next level . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Shame on you ! What are you doing ? You know you can 't build anything here ! Why do all of you stand by them ? I don 't understand . Look at yourselves . You 're so pathetic . We are the ones who try to save something . Not them . She 's so wound-up today . I 'm tiny as a molecule now . I swear . Please , don 't . Don 't do it . I am begging you . You will lose your job . Please , don 't do it . You 're all so tiny , so pathetic . And I 'm as small as a tiny molecule . A tiny molecule . But I am a hussar , after all . Please , don 't . It 's all fiction . You can 't even ride a horse . Please , don 't . I stand by you . Gleb , why do you need a tablet ? What do you want to find in the Internet ? I 'm studying lives . Looking at pages and people . Chapter 5 . The Hostage Hey , Gleb . Sveta 's gone . Everyone 's looking for her . Do you know her ? Some people are genetically inclined to a complicated view of reality . The AD gene ... Wow ! The sky over the city is so strange today . It 's electric . I hear the snow will stick this time . Hey , stop torturing yourself . Oh , and happy birthday . Here 's a present for you . It wasn 't cheap . Happy Birthday , Valya ! - You desk jockey . - Crackhead ! - Hi there ! - Hi . You came here again . Why the glasses ? Is the sun too bright ? You sold out but that never changed the sky . - Credit cowboys . - Crackhead ! Piss off , bitch ! What 's up ? Valya ! What are you doing ? Come on ! You idiot . Let 's go . So the ADRA2b gene can seriously affect your perception of the world . Where 's Sveta ? ! - Who took Sveta ? - Where 's Sveta ? Where 's Sveta ? Where 's Sveta ? Where 's Sveta ? Crackheads ! Faggots ! - Do you know this Sveta ? - No , I don 't . - I won 't let you go . - I think she 's blond . About 13 years old . Or not . Hey , I can 't find north . It says I need to make a figure eight . I can 't find north . Do you know where it is ? Why do I need it ? We defend Sveta , harsh and ruthless . Even bleed . I don 't know where north is . I only know south . Geography ... Hemisphere , heroin . Heraldics . All start with H. Any connection ? Valya , do you know where north is ? Show me . Do you know Sveta ? Valya , wait ! Was your family killed by a missile in Ukraine ? Valya ! I 'm Skyping with a friend . Save me . Why is this broken laptop here again ? Do you want some pastries ? It 's the drugs . I never see anyone in my dreams . Only our old dog . I called them and said we 're coming for Sveta . Such insolent bastards . Laughing at us . They want money for her . They said we have to pay off the debt . Sveta is an idiot . It 's her own fault they caught her . She is an idiot . Piece of crap . She is an idiot . I don 't have any money . How can I go to the police ? Do I need this ? She 's 12 , she 's all grown up . Stupid . Isn 't she ? My sister is stupid . Stupid piece of crap . She 's on her own . It 's her own fault . Nobody 'll pay money for her . I 've got no money . My sister 's stupid . Where are you going ? You 'll get killed there . You hear me ? You 'll get killed . Your whole family 's dead . You don 't have anyone else there . You ... You 'll just get killed . You 're just a small broken person . Do you want me to go with you ? Do you ? Give me a minute . Let 's get the girl back . I 'll kill you if you run away again . ( speaks a foreign language ) Did you come alone ? Your head is messed up . ( speaks a foreign language ) ( speaks a foreign language ) Easy , easy , easy ! There 's blood on my pants . So what , so we killed him . So much blood . - Who cares about drug addicts ? - What time is it ? Chapter 6 . The Architect We probably didn 't become Corbusier . So what ? Funny , but I 'm proud to be Honorary Architect . So what if I build parking lots ? - You 're divorced . So what ? - It 's funny . There 's an ache in my chest that won 't stop . And then it 's gone . - Hello . - Hi . I 've been looking for you for a month . Someone wants an architect to build a Moresque style house . With columns and a fountain . We can pay off our debts . But we 'll need to work round the clock . And you throw fits for the world ? What for ? You know about Peter Pan syndrome ? Being scared of growing up . - You should go back to your family . - Nonsense . It 's our life , it destroys neurons . Here , see ? Tell me , pal , will we go to war ? Yes . You 're wrong . Remember my birthday ? It 'll be fun . Like in 5th or 6th grade . - Dad , why are you crying ? - I 'm not crying . Some bastards recently attacked Dad . - They took his watch . - You can 't say " bastards " . Your Dad 's not crying . Your Dad 's a lion ! Go , I 'll be right there . You 'll trick me with work again . And I 'm tired of living in debt . I 'm tired of hearing I 'm a dwarf . Unlike you , I bravely face life . I 'm not so immature . Tomorrow at 5 . Did I tell you that every night I see the sun exploding in my dream ? Strange , right ? I bought a gun . And six bullets . You know that the guy who commissioned our unfinished building has died ? So they don 't complete our project , who cares ? See how they fixed my nose ? A Dr. Ho in Southeast Asia . See . The new implants are brilliant . I hear Chinese implants have everything in them . Hair dryer , microwave oven . Even a toaster . But rumor has it they 're not too reliable . They spark . See how they fixed my nose ? No ? Ok . Dr. Ho ? - No ? - Definitely not . Too bad . Are you sure you don 't know Dr. Ho ? Because ... - No ? - I don 't know him . That 's strange . Oh yes . It 's about to snow . Can you believe Paul lost his tablet ? So he lost it . Are you an elf ? The elves gather down there . But they are always late . Have you seen my black tablet ? I can 't find it . I will have to buy a new one . That one was mint . - Maybe you forgot it on the train . - Maybe . Hello . Hi . - So are you an elf ? - How can I be an elf ? Elves are eternal , and I 'm fussy . There you are again . - Are you coming ? - We 're about to start a game . Today 's probably the last time for me , though . - You 're here for no reason ? - Yes . For no reason . Today is an awesome day . I can 't figure out why . Elf ? Strange . I know this is all just childish games . Still , I don 't trust elves . I don 't like them . Even though it 's just a game . The world is really so complicated . Who are we , who am I ? Everything 's mixed up . Past and future . Real and fictional . People are so different . Or maybe it 's my age . The awkward age . - Let me try . - Go ahead ! The Orcs are stronger anyway . Let 's go , hurry up . Move on ! Quick ! - In 20 years ... - The weather 's so apocalyptic . ... the climate here will be tropical . Excuse me . Give me a ride to that corner . I 've never ridden a scooter in my life . - You 're lying . - Honestly . - Get on . - Thank you . This was all studios of artists a while ago . I don 't remember exactly where . There ... It 's so funny . The same bio-design everywhere . It was different before . Now books are the same , and these billboards . I hate chain food joints . Post-modernism . Unification , globalization ... - It broke down . - What is it ? It keeps breaking down . So stupid . - What can I do ? - Give it a push . Okay , sure . Bang ! Turn around , please . Yay ! Why do you live here instead of at home ? I just do . I like living like this . How old are you ? 25 . You 're lying . You 're actually old . Zoya ? That sure was a lie . But a talented one . A competent , skilled lie . Zoya ? Do you have tea ? Yes , just a moment . So which do you prefer : Coke or Pepsi ? I mean , which do you support ? - Did you draw this ? - No . I don 't know . I buy Coke more often . But Pepsi somehow seems nicer . Zoya , are you in the bathroom ? - What 's this book ? - It 's by Sosnovsky . A philosopher . He writes that things were good under Stalin . That Hitler wasn 't the monster everyone says . - Zoya , have you seen the teapot ? - No . It 's fairly convincing . - Good morning . - Did they have Coke in the USSR ? Nope . You seem to be a modern person . Right ? Do you remember what year Lenin died ? And who 's Kamenev ? And Solzhenitsyn - do you know who he was ? Hey ! You 're the one who 's old . You remember all that . The past is gone . We can build a new world . We just need to get rid of all the dead weight . And I do know about Solzhenitsyn . Come with me . I 'll show you what I can do . Don 't say that . Your Sosnovsky is an idiot . And are you sure your future will be better ? Don 't be scared ! Come here ! - Come on ! - I 'm not scared . Come on . Go ahead , come here ! It 's too bad . It 's a beautiful building . The man died . And the heirs don 't care about it . You 're tense , let me release the tension . He did all he could to support you . Nobody believed in this building , but he did . He said it 'll be architecture for life . They 'll sell or rebuild it . The buyers did a study . Young pros and seniors didn 't like it . We need to build a cupola or a spire . Why are you telling him about the cupola ? Get in the car , please . Peter . I 'm unhappy too . Do you want me to kneel ? Your friend at least asked for money . - My birthday 's coming up . - What ? You should come . It 'll be fun . I 've been promised polyglot penguins . - I 'll give you a ride . - No , thanks . - Thank you . Good bye . - Good bye . - Give me the reading . - 38 points . ( speaking Japanese ) Wait ! You see that building ? You think it needs a spire or a cupola ? It needs columns or marble . I don 't know . Thank you . I hear one of the architects went crazy . Funny . An architect of that building wanted to burn himself alive . But the matches were wet . Everyone laughs at that for some reason . Even if he wanted to do it , who cares ? - Is something wrong ? - I had a dream . A scary one . About the end of the world . So now I 'm sad . I just saw this film about diseases . Now I don 't eat tomatoes . - What do you do ? - I 'm an architect . Incredibly trendy . But meaningless . I position bathtubs and sinks in space and time . I combine bidets and toilets . - That 's what I do for a living . - What 's a bidet ? I don 't know . I don 't know anything at all . Come to my birthday party . In a week . Would you like to ? Here 's an invitation . It 'll be fun . We 'll have exotic dancing . A hyena from the Galapagos Islands . Lots of things . Stravinsky , Schnittke and Metallica . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . - Thank you . - That 's it . Artyom . What are you doing here ? - Where 's your father ? - Mom left long ago . I don 't ' know where . Dad couldn 't fall asleep for a long time . Then he went for a walk . I told him there were bastards out there . - But he said it didn 't matter . - Where did he go ? I don 't know . I 'll go find your dad . But you go to sleep . Okay ? Let 's go home ! Come on . Karim ! Karim ! ( speaking a foreign language ) Karim ! Sorry , pal , I forgot we had an agreement . Do you know they 'll re-do our building soon ? - I know . - They 'll probably demolish it . They built a new store , see ? I designed the parking structure . It 's shit . - Give me the gun . Give it here . - I 'm out of bullets . We had great art and science . People fought , aspired , made sacrifices . We were taught to learn from their examples . What for ? Isn 't it incredibly funny ? There was this whole world , and now it 's gone . There 's nothing left . - Let 's go home . - I wanted to tell you something . I don 't want to feel like a dwarf . I 'm a titan . I lost my wallet . How was my shooting ? Great , right ? Really great . ( speaking a foreign language ) ( speaking a foreign language ) ( speaking a foreign language ) ( reciting a poem ) Farewell then , sea ! I won 't forget Your beauty full of solemn power ; Long will I be hearing yet Your rumble at an evening hour To silent wilderness , to groves I 'll carry over , filled with you , - Your crags and waves ... - I don 't believe it . What you are saying is just propaganda . The number of Stalin 's victims is exaggerated . Nobody would put people in prison for no reason . Especially kids . They must have been guilty . I 'll call you tonight . - Hi ! - Hi , guys ! - You seem cheerful . - You 've lost weight . I 'm glad to see you . - We 'll go look at camels . - You have a nice son . Thank you . You know , it 's probably time for bed . - Where 's Mom ? - She 'll be home in 2 days . And where 's Dad ? Thanks . Thanks . I 'm trying . Yes , birthdays are great . It 's all set and ready . I 'm downtown , there 's tons of traffic here . Start toasting to me . It 's you . We never finished our conversation . Remember the building we never got to finish ? They 're going to demolish it . I 'm sorry , pal . I 'm so confused . First you grow up . Then you buy something cheaper . Then ... Then something larger and more expensive . Then the really expensive stuff . Then you get old . Your children grow up and repeat the cycle . The same books , same houses , same food . Even the things I say are the same . I want to disappear from the world . To sail away , to leave . It 's so stupid . No point in anything . I remember the hall in my old apartment . I was little . The new world was ahead . Now that apartment is gone . Everything is gone . What can I say ? I can 't help you . I 'm dead . I lost my scarf . This scarf is mine . Come with us . - It 'll be fun . - Thank you ! I brought a musician . Virtuoso accordion player . But he 's already drunk . He 's my friend . Do you know that Mickey Rourke 's dog is dead ? I wrote a poem . Mickey Rourke 's dog is gone I 'm sadly just walking on And my arms are on my coat front - How 's that ? - You 're no Brodsky . But it 's touching , about the dog . New Zealand tango . From Port Brisbane . - Are you crying ? - No . It 's just that you 're at that age , a very nervous age . You want something , you get anxious , but then it all passes . I know this great joint nearby . A really great one . You 've just gotten older . I bought a fast car . It 's surreally beautiful . It will work out for you . You need to believe . You 're the same . It 's good . So don 't be upset . The world 's just complicated . There 's this poem . I lay thinking how diverse this world is I reasoned : even if we pay attention We learn about big or small events By accident , if we do at all . Let 's go , we have a bit of youth left . Chapter 7 . The Landlady I don 't get it . Why did you buy these statues ? They speak the language of emotions . If the artist wanted to say something about the complexity of the world he needs some kind of an intellectual context . The same is true of your dad 's building . Please support the decision to build the cupola . I canceled it . No cupola , no spire . - Hello , Alexandra Fyodorovna . - Hi . There is some irony , some play in it . You should do things not because they 're right or need to be done . But because you can 't live any other way . You can 't waste money . Everyone is laughing . There 's nobody like you in the city . - Stop talking nonsense . - What nonsense ? - You know ... What cupola ? What spire ? - We had to sell this unfinished building . Why would a young girl run these companies ? - She could just leave Russia . - She does as she wishes . - Are you waiting for someone ? - No . I thought I saw someone I knew . Hello , Alexandra Fyodorovna . This is Snezhana . Let 's go . Wait , I 'll be there in a sec . - Hi . - Hello . Is something wrong ? I keep thinking about something . I think not many people are capable of pure love . What most people call love is not love at all . It 's just conquering your loneliness and fear , looking for comfort . But real love almost never exists , right ? I don 't know . Snezhana and I are okay . And Edik with Marina . It 's a pity the exhibition is over . Do you know everyone is laughing at us ? Alexandra Fyodorovna ? They say it will be cold in spring . - Are you cold ? - No . - Hi . What 's your name ? - Sveta . Some people call me Svetka . But I think it 's insulting . - Why are you alone ? - People aren 't worth much . There was one good person , but he got killed . - Why are you alone ? - I ran away from them . I 'm looking for a new life . Come on , let 's go . - Can I help you ? - Need help ? No , I 'm fine . I like doing this . Allez-hop ! Look at me walking the horse . - The summer will come soon . - They 'll build all of it soon then . A new life is good . I 'm starting one , too . Let me help you . - Is it too heavy ? - No . I escaped anyway . My brother abandoned me . The wind has stopped .

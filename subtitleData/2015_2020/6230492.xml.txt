When you see my name , push it . OK ? And remember ... Something chases you , run . Come on . - All right . - That 's funny . Okay , let 's go . - Bye , guys . - Bye ! I miss you already ! So much for our last family breakfast . Why do you have to say things like that ? Did you call your sister ? Straight to voicemail . They 'll be fine . She handles 20,000 people a day , right ? She can handle two more . JUAN SANTAMARĂŤA AIRPORT , COSTA RICA How big is the island ? Big . But how many pounds ? That doesn 't make sense . When they first opened , they had 8 species . Now , they have 14 herbivores ... and 6 carnivores . That 's like , 50 tons of food a week . Welcome to Isla Nublar , home of Jurassic World . We hope you have a safe and enjoyable stay with us . - ------------- Where 's Aunt Claire ? OK , those here in the front of the train should be able to see our main gates . JURASSIC WORLD Please obey all park rules . Proper attire , including shoes and shirts , must be worn at all times . Your aunt arranged to reach you at 1 : 00 . Can he slow down ? Nope . Come on ! Your aunt 's got you VIP access . So you can get in all the rides without waiting in line . Let 's go ! Dude , she said we have to wait . I don 't wanna wait anymore ! Har Osterley , Vice President . Jim Drucker , bad hair . Erica Brand , deserves better . Hal , Jim , Erica . And I am Claire . Three minutes late . Welcome to Jurassic World . While year over year revenue continues to ... climb , operating costs are higher than ever . Our shareholders have been patient , but , let 's be honest ... No one 's impressed by a dinosaur anymore . 20 years ago , " de-extinction " was right up there with magic . These days , kids look at a stegosaurus like an elephant from the city zoo . That doesn 't mean asset development has fallen behind . Our DNA excavators discover new species every year . But consumers want them bigger . Louder . More teeth . The good news ? Our advances in gene splicing have opened up a whole new frontier . We 've learned more from genetics in the past decade ... than a century of digging up bones . So ... when you say you want to sponsor an attraction ... What do you have in mind ? We want to be thrilled . Don 't we all . The Indominus rex . Our first genetically modified hybrid . How did you get two different kinds of dinosaurs to ... you know ? Indominus wasn 't bred . She was designed . She will be 50 feet long when fully grown . Bigger than the T. rex . Every time we 've unveiled a new asset , attendance has spiked . Global news coverage . Celebrity visitors . Eyes of the world . When will she be ready ? She already is . Come on ! Relax . Come on ! Dude , chill . Welcome to the Innovation Center . Where technology meets prehistory . ... with the horns , is truly the apex prey . Literally meaning " three horned face " in Greek ... Triceratops is half ... . ... as one hundred trillion tons of TNT . ... its head back to look over its shoulder ... to better aim the swing of its dangerous tail . DNA Cytosine , guanine , adenine and thymine . Same 4 things in everything that ever lived . Hey , don 't wander off , alright ? Mom 's not paying me for babysitting . Gray ! Is that you ? Aunt Claire ! OK , yeah . Now I 'm gonna have to go . My nephews are here . Hi ! My gosh , you 're so sweet . Woah , Zach . Last time I saw you , you were like ... That must 've been what ... - Three , four years ago ? - Seven . Seven years . But , y 'know . Close . So I see you already got your wristbands ... and this is for food . And Zara here is going to take great care of you until I 'm done working tonight , okay ? You 're not coming with us ? I really wish that I could , but ... tomorrow , I could take you into the control room . Show you behind the scenes , and all of that . That 's ... That 's gonna be cool , right ? Ok , so , I will see you tonight , at 6 : 00 . No , don 't forget , you have the ... Right , of course . I will see you tonight at 8 : 00 . What time do you go to sleep ? Or do you go to sleep at different times ? Okay , so , have fun ... And take very good care of them , okay ? Yeah . No , I 'm here . Those two juvenile Triceratops are going at it again . Should I tranq them or are you coming over and take care of this ? - Yeah , go ahead and tranq them . - Roger . - What 's the live count ? - 22,216 . - Any incidents ? - Yeah . Six kids in a lost and found ... 28 down with heat stroke ... Where did you get that ? This ? I got it on eBay . Yeah , it 's pretty amazing . I got it for $ 150 , but a mint condition one goes for $ 300 ... Didn 't it occur to you maybe that 's in poor taste ? This shirt ? Yeah , no , it did . I understand people died . It was terrible , but ... That first park was legit . You know ? I have a lot of respect for it . They didn 't need these genetic hybrids . They just needed dinosaurs , real dinosaurs ... Okay . Please don 't wear it again . Yeah , wasn 't gonna ... - Did you close the deal ? - Looks like it . Verizon Wireless presents the Indominus rex . Ugh . That 's so terrible . Why not just go the distance Claire , and just let these corporations name the dinosaurs ? They 've got all the ballparks . - Why stop there ? - Why are the west plains closed ? Another Pachy roaming outside the zone . But he 's fully sedated and ready for relocation . " Pepsisaurus " or " Tostitodon " . Security said the invisible fences were a no fail , that is the second time this month . Well the Pachys short out their implants when they butt heads ... How much longer until they get it out of there ? He just got 5 mg of carfentanil . Yes , he 's very stoned . So why don 't we show a little sympathy ? I mean you do understand these are actual animals , right ? Clean up your workspace . It 's ... chaotic . I like to think of it as a living system . Just enough stability to keep it from collapsing from the anarchy . Inbound chopper , Jurassic 1 . ETA 5 minutes . Claire . Mr. Masrani ! You 're flying . I got my license . - Two more . - Two more days . So ... - How 's my park doing ? - Great . We 're up 2.5 % over last year , a bit lower than our initial infraction . No , no , how 's it doing ? Are the guests having fun ? Are the animals enjoying life ? Well , guest satisfaction is steady in the low 90s . We don 't have a way to measure the animals ' emotional experience . So you do . You can see in their eyes . Right ? Of course . Okay . I 'll show you my new dinosaur . Got it . Got it . Got it ! Oh , my ... ! You look tense , Claire . Maybe you should just focus on the controls . The key to a happy life is to accept you are never actually in control . Bird ! You should spend a day at the beach . Get some sun ! Right . So ... Marketing thought we could offset some of the costs ... Oh , enough about costs . John Hammond entrusted me with his dying wish and not once did he mention profits . " Spare no expense " , he used to say . I appreciate that , but the reality of operating a theme park ... Don 't forget why we built this place , Claire . Jurassic World exists to remind us how very small we are ... How new . You can 't put a price on that . Now please , we 're flying ! Breathe ! Is he okay ? Are you okay ? He 's just being dramatic . Are you still building ? We planned to open in May ... but Asset Containment insisted we build the walls up higher . It 's bigger than expected . It 's about time . We hit a few speed bumps early on . It began to anticipate where the food would come from . One of the handlers nearly lost an arm ... The others threatened to quit if I couldn 't guarantee their safety . So she 's intelligent , then ? For a dinosaur . And that ? It tried to break the glass . I like her spirit . It 's white . You didn 't tell me it was white . Think it 'll scare the kids ? The kids ? This will give the parents nightmares . Is that , good ? It 's fantastic . Could she see us ? They say it can sense thermal radiation , like snakes . Some said there were two of them . There was a sibling in case this one didn 't survive infancy . Where is the sibling ? She ate it . So , the paddock 's quite safe then ? We have the best structural engineers in the world . So did Hammond . There 's an American navy man here . Part of a research program one of my companies is running . Owen Grady . I know who he is . His animals often try to escape . They 're smart . He has to be smarter . And we 're gonna see smarter . I want you to bring him in . Let him inspect the paddock . Maybe he sees something we can 't . Hold ! Okay ! Eyes on me ! Blue ? Blue ! Watch it ! Charlie ! Hey ! Don 't give me that shit ! Delta ! Lock it up ! Good ! And , we 're moving ! Hold ! That 's good . That is damn good . Very good ! See , Charlie ? That 's what you get ! Echo , here you go ! Delta ! Blue ? This one 's for you . Hold ! Eyes up ! Go ! You finally did it , man ! Owen ! I was starting to think I hired the wrong guys but , damn , you got them eating out of your palm . You came on a good day . It 's not usually a happy ending . Is that why you 're not sending in your reports ? We 've been busy . Too busy to cash your paycheck . What do you need , buddy ? A field test . Hey , I 've just seen they can respond to commands . You need to take the research , and get it on the field . They 're wild animals , Hoskins , trust me . You don 't want them in the field . I just saw a bond . A real bond . Between man and beast . You 're in my way . We 're the same , we 're dogs of war . We know that the military needs to reduce casualties . Some people think that robots are the future . Look , nature gave us the most effective killing machines 75 million years ago . And now we know they can take orders . We finally make progress and that 's the first thing he says ? Make a weapon ? Shit . Come on , gents . It 's grown up time . Drones can 't search tunnels . And caves . And they 're hackable . The minute the real war breaks out , all that fancy tech is gonna go dark . But that tech 's not gonna eat them if they forget to feed it . Look at these creatures . They got millions of years of instinct in their cells . Instinct that we can program . Their loyalty cannot be bought . These guys are gonna run straight into the enemies ' teeth and eat ' em , belt buckle and all . What if they decide they wanna be in control ? Well then we remind them who is . We terminate the rogues . Promote only loyal bloodlines . What 's so funny ? You come here and you don 't learn anything about these animals except what you wanna know . You made them and now you think you own them . We do own them . Extinct animals have no rights . They 're not extinct anymore , Hoskins . Exactly . We 're sitting on a gold mine . And Masrani is using it to stock a petting zoo . He just wants to teach people some humility . He doesn 't make weapons . You think that the eighth richest man in the world ... is only into oil , telecom , and family fun parks ? He 's so diversified he doesn 't even know what he owns . How long has ingen been practicing this pitch ? Since the day we hired you out of the navy . You knew the endgame . These animals can replace thousands of troops on the ground . How many lives would that save ? War is part of nature . Look around , Owen . Every living thing in this jungle ... is trying to murder the other . Mother Nature 's way of testing her creations . We 're finding the pecking order . War is a struggle . Struggle breeds greatness . Without that ... we end up in places like this , charged 7 $ a soda . Do you hear yourself when you talk ? This is gonna happen , with or without your boys . Progress always wins , man . Maybe progress should lose for once . Pig loose ! Pig loose ! Owen , no ! No , no , hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! Do not fire ! Push 12 amps in these animals , they 're never gonna trust me again . Blue ... stand down . Stand down . Hey , hey ! What did I just say ? Delta , I see you . Back up . Okay . Good . Good . Charlie ? Stay right there . Good . Close the gate . Are you crazy ? Just trust me . Close the gate ! I 'm fine . So are you listening closely ? You 're the new guy , right ? Yeah . You ever wonder why there was a job opening ? Don 't ever turn your back to the cage . Lift me up ! I can 't see ! I 'm not dad . You 're not five . I can swear the triceratops would be 47 and a half inches . This place is for little kids . Yeah , I know . - You wanna go to the spinning dinosaur eggs ? - No . Cover up your dork patch . Because it 's my wedding . No , Alex , you 're not having a bachelor party . Because all his friends are animals . Scatter ! - What ? - Go , run ! Go ! The next T. Rex feeding will begin in ten minutes . T. rex ! C 'mon , man ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Parents be aware , this show may be disturbing for smaller children . Hey , mom . You were supposed to call me when you landed . Are you having fun ? Yeah . I guess . Aunt Claire gave us passes so we don 't have to wait in line . Wait , she 's not with you ? - ---- Hey , Karen ! Hi , Claire , how 's it going ? Yeah , everything 's great . The boys are having fun . Everyone 's ... .. Everyone 's good . Really ? ' Cause I just hung up with Zach and he said you weren 't even with them . Yeah , look . Today turned out to be a really bad day for me . They 're in great hands . They 're with my assistant . She 's British , so ... Like they invented nannies ... Wait , are you crying ? This was supposed to be a family weekend , Claire . You haven 't seen the boys in forever . And I know how Zach will treat Gray if they 're by themselves , and he can just be so mean . Okay , I 'm sorry . Tomorrow I 'm gonna spend the entire day with them . I 'm going to take off work and I will not leave their side . I promise . A promise tomorrow is worth a lot less than trying today . You 're using mom 's lines now ? Oh , my God , I am using mom 's lines . I 'm sorry but you know I have to tell you they work . You 'll see when you have kids . Yeah . If . " When " . It 's worth it . Bye , mom ! Bye . What do they want now ? Mr. Grady ? I need you to come take a look at something . Why are you calling me Mr. Grady ? Owen . - If you 're not too busy . - I am pretty busy . We have an attraction . That 's not what you said the last time I saw you . I 'm talking about the dinosaurs , Mr. Grady . Owen . A new species ... we 've made . You just went and made a new dinosaur ? Yeah , it 's kinda what we do here . But the exhibit opens to the public in three weeks . Mr. Masrani wanted me to consult with you . You wanna consult here ? Or in my Bungalow ? That 's not funny . A little funny . We 'd like you to evaluate the paddock for vulnerabilities . Why me ? I guess , Mr. Masrani thinks since you 're able to control the raptors ... See , it 's all about control with you . I don 't control the raptors . It 's a relationship . It 's based on mutual respect . That 's why you and I never had a second date . Excuse me . I never wanted a second date . Who prints out an itinerary for a night out ? I 'm an organized person . What kind of a diet doesn 't allow tequila ? All of them , actually . And what kind of a man shows up to a date in board shorts ? It 's Central America . It 's hot . Okay , can we just focus on the asset , please ? The asset ? Look , I get it . You 're in charge out here . You gotta make a lot of tough decisions . It 's probably easier to pretend these animals are just , numbers on a spreadsheet . But they 're not . They 're alive . I 'm fully aware they 're alive . You might 've made them in a test tube . But they don 't know that . They 're thinking ... " I gotta eat " . " I gotta hunt . I gotta ... " You can relate to at least , one of those things . Right ? I 'll be in my car . You might want to change your shirt . They 're very sensitive to smell . The Mosasaurus was thought to have hunted near the surface of the water ... where it preyed on anything it could sink its teeth into ... including turtles , large fish , even smaller Mosasaurus . Okay folks , let 's see if she 's still hungry after already eating today . She 's a little shy , so be nice and give her a hand when she comes out . Zach ! It 's Mosasaurus ! Oh , my God ! That was awesome ! Hold on tight . We 're gonna give you an even closer look at our Mosasaurus . It has 88 teeth ! - Hey , you wanna see something else cool ? - Yeah ! We 've been pre booking tickets for months . The park needs a new attraction every few years ... in order to reinvigorate the public 's interest . Kind of like the space program . Corporate felt genetic modification would up the wow factor . They 're dinosaurs . Wow enough . Not according to our focus groups . The " Indominus rexâ € ť makes us relevant again . The Indominus rex ? We needed something scary and easy to pronounce . You should hear a four year old try to say " Archaeornithomimus " . You should hear you try to say it . What 's this thing made of ? The base genome is a T. Rex . The rest is classified . You made a new dinosaur but you don 't even know what it is ? The lab delivers us finished assets and we show them to the public . Can we drop a steer , please ? How long has the animal been in here ? All its ' life . Never seen anything outside of these walls ? We can 't exactly walk it . And you feed it with that ? Is there a problem ? Animals raised in isolation aren 't always the most functional . Your raptors are born in captivity . With siblings . They learn social skills . And I imprint on them when they 're born . There 's trust . The only positive relationship this animal has is with that crane . At least she knows that means food . So she needs a friend ? We should schedule play dates , that sort of thing ? Probably not a good idea . - Where is it ? - What , is it in the basement ? Is there a downstairs ? Maybe it 's in the rec room . It was just here . We were just here . Oh , shoot . - -------- It doesn 't make any sense . These doors haven 't opened all week . Were those claw marks always there ? You think it ... ? Oh , God . She has an implant in her back . I can track it from the control room . We have an asset out of containment ! Put ACU on alert ! This is not a drill ! Even though I didn 't meet him ' till I was thirteen ... I definitely consider Carl to be my more real dad than my real dad . - -------- - Yeah , hello ? - Lowery . Get me coordinates on the Indominus . Okay , yeah ... I 'm getting it right now . The wall 's forty feet high . You really think she could 've climbed out ? Depends . On what ? What kind of dinosaur they cooked up in that lab . What the hell ? It 's in the cage . That 's impossible . I was just there . Claire , I 'm telling you she 's in the cage . Wait a second . There are people in there . Get them out of there now . Now ! Paddock 11 , this is control . You need to evacuate the cont ... Paddock 11 ! Paddock 11 , do you copy ? What 's the problem ? It 's in the cage ! It 's in there with you ! Go ! Close the door . - We can 't lock them in there with that thing ! - Come on ! Close it down ! Somebody talk to me ! What is happening ? Shit ! Everyone remain calm . The implant will shock it if it gets too close to a perimeter fence . Okay , it 's moving really fast . This is control , put out a park-wide alert . Quiet on the damn phone , please . Sorry , I 'm giving you information . Everything 's fine . Let Asset Containment capture it quietly . The very existence of this park is predicated on our ability to handle incidents like this . It was an eventuality , okay ? You should put that in the brochure . " Eventually , one of these things will eat somebody " . That paddock is four miles from the closest attraction . ACU can handle this . No one else is gonna get eaten ? How fast can they run ? Forty . 50 when they 're hungry . You ever open them up , see what they can do ? No . That got me . It got me . What do you think ? Wanna take one home ? Hey , don 't joke . When I was your age ... I rescued a wolf pup . It 's like two months old . Could barely walk . So I let him sleep on my bed ... And watch over me . My wife , she came at me with a steak knife . He took a chunk out of her arm . You put him down ? Hell , no . We had a ... unshakeable bond , you know ? Just like you and ... What 's his name ? Delta . And she 's a girl . Can I ... ? Oh , wow ! Code 19 ! - It 's the new one ! - They say we lost two guys ! What 's a code 19 ? Asset out of containment . These people , they never learn . They 're gonna learn all kinds of things about their new asset now . Yeah , it 's me . We might have an opportunity here . You guys been here before ? If mom and dad get divorced , will one of us be with mom and the other with dad ? What ? Why would you say that ? Because they are . No , they 're not . They 're not getting divorced . You haven 't been around long enough . They 've always been that way . They 're getting mail from two different lawyers . That doesn 't mean anything . I googled . They 're divorce lawyers . Whatever . You know what ? It doesn 't matter , okay ? I 'm gonna be gone in two years anyway . All my friends ' parents are divorced . Hey , knock it off . Are you gonna cry ? Look , you 're gonna get two everything . Right ? You 'll get two birthdays , two thanksgivings ... - Two ... - I don 't want two of everything . Yeah , well , it 's not up to you . There 's a point you have to grow up . I need to see your badge . Sir ! - Sir . Sir ! - What the hell happened out there ? There were thermal cameras all over that paddock ! She did not just disappear ! It must 've been some kind of , technical malfunction . Were you not watching ? She marked up that wall as a distraction ! She wanted us to think she escaped ! Hold on , we are talking about an animal here . A highly intelligent animal . 400 meters to the beacon . You 're going after her with non-lethals ? We have $ 26 million invested in that asset . We can 't just kill it . Those men are gonna die . 300 meters to the beacon . - You need to call this mission off right now . - They 're right on top of it . Call it off , right now . You are not in control here ! Blood 's not clotted yet . It 's close . What is that ? That 's her tracking implant . She clawed it out . How would it know to do that ? She remembered where they put it in . It can camouflage ! - --------- - --------- - -------- Evacuate the island . We 'd never reopen . You made a genetic hybrid . Raised it in captivity . She is seeing all of this for the first time . She does not even know what she is . She will kill everything that moves . You think the animal is contemplating its own existence ? She is learning where she fits in the food chain and I 'm not sure you want her to figure that out . No . Asset Containment can use live ammunition in an emergency situation . You have an M-134 in your armory . Put it on a chopper and smoke this thing ! We have families here . I 'm not gonna turn this place into some kind of a warzone . You already have . Mr. Grady , if you 're not gonna help , there 's no reason for you to be in here . I would have a word , with your people in the lab . That thing out there ... that 's no dinosaur . - --------- I 'm going to close everything north of the resort . This is a Phase One , real world . Bring everyone in . This is a Phase One , real world . I repeat , this is a Phase One . Bring everyone back in . Did you know that time lets soft tissue preserve because the iron in a dinosaur 's blood generates free radicals ? So the proteins and the cell membranes get all mixed up , and act as a natural preservative . The DNA can survive for millennia that way . So now , even if the amber mines dry up , they still have ... Shut up . What do you think 's gonna happen when you 're just staring at them ? - Thanks , man . - You 're welcome . Enjoy the ride . Pregnant women and those who suffer from motion sickness ... should consult with a doctor before riding the sphere . Enjoy the ride . Hello ? Seriously ? Sorry , folks . Ride 's closed . Everyone needs to proceed to the monorail in the ... Come on , guys . I just work here . Due to technical difficulties , all our exhibits are now closed . You know that I am not at levity to reveal the asset 's genetic makeup . Modified animals are known to be unpredictable . It has killed people , Henry . That 's unfortunate . What purpose could we have for a dinosaur that can camouflage ? Cuttlefish genes were added to help her withstand an accelerated growth rate . Cuttlefish have chromatophores that allow the skin to change color . It hid from thermal technology . Really ? How is that possible ? Tree frogs can modulate their infrared output . We used strands from their DNA to adapt her to a tropical climate . But I never imagined ... Who authorized you to do this ? You did . " Bigger " . " Scarier " . " Cooler " , I believe is the word that you used in your memo . You cannot have an animal with exaggerated predator features without the corresponding behavioral traits . What you are doing here ... What you have done ... The board will shut down this park , seize your work , everything you built . And Hammond won 't be there to protect you this time . All of this exists ... because of me . If I don 't innovate , somebody else will . You are to cease all activities here immediately . You are acting like we are engaged in some kind of mad science . But we are doing what we have done from the beginning . Nothing in Jurassic World is natural . We have always filled gaps in the genome with the DNA of other animals . And , if their genetic code was pure , many of them would look quite different . But you didn 't ask for reality . You asked for more teeth . - I never asked for a monster ! - " Monster " is a relative term . To a canary , a cat is a monster . We 're just used to being the cat . Hey there . I 'm Jimmy Fallon . Welcome aboard the gyrosphere , an amazing machine made possible by science . Your safety is our main concern . Which is why you 're behind our invisible barrier system which protects you from things like , Dilophosaurus venom . One drop of this can paralyze you , so watch out . Is this real ? It is ? And for added protection , each vehicle is surrounded by aluminum oxynitride glass . So tough , it can stop a 50 caliber bullet . The gyroscopic technology will keep you upright at all times . Where are they ? So you got nothing to worry about . Oh , man . Due to technical difficulties , all our exhibits are now closed . Please disembark all rides , and return to the resort . Come on . We can stay a couple of more minutes . But , they said it was closed . Aunt Claire gave us special wristbands , right ? VIP , dude . Come on . It 'll be fun . - Hello ? - Zara . I need you to bring the boys back to the hotel right away . I don 't know , I 've been looking everywhere for them ... Slow down , I can 't hear you ... Zach and Gray , they 're in the gyro ! They what ? Hey , Claire . Zach , thank God . Is Gray with you ? I can 't really hear you . We 're in the hamster ball . Okay , Zach , listen to me . I need you to ... Hello ? - Hello ? - Zach ? Are there any gyrospheres left in the valley ? No , they 're all accounted for . It 's my job . What ? Yeah , there 's one in the field . Send a team of rangers . Bring them in . Security , we need a search and rescue in the valley . It 's gonna be a while . We got our hands full out here . No , no , no , there are two guests missing . You need to make this your top priority ! Just do it , man . We 're doing the best we can . Okay fine , I 'll do it myself . Do you think I 'm the one you need to be worried about right now ? Back up ! What happened here ? - ---------- Dude . Off road . But they told us to go back . I 'm just worried that you 're not getting the full Jurassic World experience . With our new invisible sense technology ... ( narrations ) ( foreign narration ) Claire . - I need you . - Okay . I need your help . My nephews , they 're out in the valley . Please , if anything happens to them ... How old . The older one , he 's like high school age . The younger one , he 's , umm ... He 's , a few years ... You don 't know how old your nephews are ? No , no , bad idea , bad idea . Great idea . No ! We 're gonna get arrested , they 'll shave our heads ... and we 're gonna have to make root beer in the toilet . What are you talking about ? Here . You see ? I told you . You 're welcome . Up close and personal with four ... " Dinosauruses " . Ankylosaurus . We shouldn 't be here . And there 's five dinosaurs . Aren 't you supposed to be a genius or something ? Look . One , two , three ... Four . Five . Go , go , go ! Drive ! We 're safe in here , right ? Yeah , we 're totally safe . ( phone vibrating ) Come on ... Pick up , pick up , pick up . Zach . - Hey , Zach . - I 've got it ... - Zach . - Yeah . - Look . - What ? Go ! Go . - We 're gonna have to jump . - I can 't . Are you ready ? One , two ... . ! You jumped . Stay in the car . All right . All right . ( pained moans ) It 's all right . We 're gonna go . You 're okay . You 're okay , you 're okay . It didn 't eat them . It 's killing for sport . Units on standby , ready for go . Good . Hold off on that live feed . We got an evolving situation here . They give you the green light yet ? They will . Owen ... we have a situation here . Be safe . Welcome aboard the gyrosphere . An amazing machine made possible by science . Hey there ? Your safety is our main concern . Just relax and enjoy the ride . Can stop a fifty cal ... Oh , no , no , no . Hey ... They made it out . Oh my God , they jumped . Brave kids . Zach . Gray . Hey , I am not one of your damn animals . Listen ... Those kids are still alive but you and I will not be ... If you continue to scream like that . So ... You can pick up their scent , can 't you ? Uh ... Track their footprints ? I was with the navy , not the navajo . What should we do ? What do you suggest we do ? You get back . I 'll find them . No , we 'll find them . You 'll last two minutes in there ... less in those ridiculous shoes . What does that suppose to mean ? It means I 'm ready to go . Okay . Let 's get one thing straight . I 'm in charge out here ... you do everything I say , exactly as I say it . - Excuse me ? - Just relax . It 's just like taking a stroll through the woods . 65 million years ago . Stay here . You still have those matches ? Here you go . Gray . 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara . Sand beige . You remember when we fixed up grandpa 's old Malibu , right ? Yeah . Every time this thing kills , it moves further south . It 's headed right for the park . No , why would she come here ? She can sense thermal radiation . Our emergency measures just put all the warm bodies in one place . - --------- - Sir . - ingen . Hoskins . I know who you are . Then you know why I 'm here . I 've been working for two years on an application for those raptors . They can hunt , and kill that creature . Your program was to test their intelligence . Yeah , it was and we did . And in the process ... We learned something ... They follow orders . You see , the solution to your crisis ... is standing right in front of you . Let me be as clear as I can . No Velociraptors are going to be set loose on this island . Oh , you 're .. You 're out of your mind . What are you gonna do with all of these people ? You got 20,000 people here . What are you gonna do ? They have no place to go . That thing is a killing machine . And it will not stop . Okay . I intend to personally look into your project to determine its viability . Within the moral principles of this company . Okay , boss . What 's your next move ? Sir , I can 't get a hold of your instructor . Never mind . He 's likely caught up in the evacuation . You 're sure there 's nobody else who could fly a helicopter ? I don 't need anyone else . You think it 's out there ? But I know for a fact ... that it 's definitely not out there , alright ? We 're totally safe . Here ... We 'll take this . You 're stronger than me . All right , turn it over . It works . Alright . I thought you failed the driver 's test ? No , only the driving part . This one of theirs ? Ah , yeah ... That road goes straight back to the park . How did they even get one of these things started ? ( roars ) Lowery ... We found her . South of the Gyrosphere valley between the old park and the aviary . Wait , are you following the dinosaur ? Yes . Get ACU out here , real guns this time . ACU is airborne . They took the helicopter . Who 's flying it ? Did you boys serve the Armed Forces ? In Afghanistan , sir . Did your general ever fly to battle with you ? Got it . Got it . We have eyes on the target . South of the aviary . Come on , look alive boys . Look alive . 10 o 'clock , by the bird cage ! No , no , no , no . Looks like the fox got in the hen house . Pull up ! Up ! Up ! We have a breach in the aviary . Trees . Trees , go , go . Okay , that 's it . We 're safe now . Go , go , go ! Go , go ! - Hey . - Help . Open the gate ! Open it up . Open it up ! Come on ! That 's a first . Open the gate ! Let us in ! Hello ? We spotted the boys on surveillance . They 're approaching the west gate . I 'm heading there now . - Okay . - Okay . Stay right there . I 'm on my way . Stay right with them . Hey . Get on . Ladies and gentlemen ... Due to a containment anomaly ... All guests must take shelter immediately . Ladies and gentlemen ...

Simon Masrani 's death , was a tragedy . The new mission ... Is to prevent further loss of life . Uh , who are these guys ? I 'm glad you asked . You 're all relieved of duty . There 's a new team on the ground . Lowery , I 'm on my way back to you . That 's a bad idea . The board assigned emergency ops ... to ingen 's private security division . This guy Hoskins is in charge . And he has this insane plan to use the raptors to hunt the Indominus . What do you mean use the raptors ? Son of a bitch . You shouldn 't say " bitch " . Take the kids . Get them someplace safe . You got this , you got this ! Faster . Drive ! This does not feel safe . Can we stay with you ? I am never leaving you as long as you live .

The mother hen has finally arrived . Woah . Get the hell out of here ... and stay away from my animals . Hoskins , you wanted this to happen , you son of a bitch . Oh , Jesus . How many more people have to die ... before this mission starts to make sense to you ? It 's not a mission . It 's a field test . This is an ingen situation now ... Okay , there are gonna be cruise ships that show up here at first light . Everybody 's gonna get off this island . You gonna watch the news story tomorrow ? About how you all saved lives ?

We know that she is in sector 5 . This is a game we call " Hide and seek " . It 's a scent drill we 've done about a thousand times with these animals . When they get on target , and they will get on target , Wait to engage . Velociraptors are pack hunters . They like to herd the animal into a kill zone . That 's when we take a shot . Get a clear shot , wait on my command ... and give her everything you got . We got one good target , gentlemen . Do not shoot my raptors . Please . Easy , Blue . Easy . There you go . You don 't scare me . Owen . Are they safe ? No , they 're not . What are their names ? Well , we have Charlie . Echo . Here is Delta . This one 's called Blue . She 's the Beta . Who 's the Alpha ?

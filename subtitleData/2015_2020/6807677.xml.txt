 Why do I think I 'm ready for the Process ? Well , I 'm smart , I can do math . I can recite the alphabet backwards . I can draw well , I know carpentry , and I 'm ready for the Offshore , I swear . You 're very good , Fernando . But I dare you to guess what number I 'm thinking . Most people guess five or seven . You look like someone who would pick five . Do you really believe that ? Congratulations ! That is correct . Now you can go to the Offshore . I passed ! I passed ! I 'm going to the Offshore ! I 'm going ! Finally ! I passed ! I 'm going to the Offshore ! I passed ! I passed ! OFFSHORE The medical examination is a mandatory step for the evaluation of a future citizen of the Offshore . To remain in the Process , you must be assessed as fit . Candidate , follow directions to your next test . Candidate , follow directions to your next test . Do you have a problem ? No , no . It 's just ... You 're the one who made the cube out of cubes , right ? Yeah . How did you hear about that ? People are talking about " the guy who saved the girl . " " The cripple is a genius ! He made a cube out of cubes . " - Congratulations , man , you 're famous ! - Thanks . That 's my cube ! What the hell ? This is the kind of person he 's letting through . He says it 's to fight the Cause , but it 's destroying our side . This video is not enough . But he almost drowned an agent . Those are not crimes , Aline . To overthrow Ezequiel , you have to find something more compromising . Understood ? Candidate , follow directions to your next test . I just want to make sure there 's no misunderstanding between us . No . Everything is quite clear . Candidate , follow directions to your next test . She seemed cool . I 'm telling you , that girl is with the Cause . - No way . - She 's with the Cause . - You guys really think so ? - No way , she 's cool . Dude , listen to me . She 's with the Cause . Michele , you know her , don 't you ? - Who ? - Bruna . - She went missing . - Do you know where she is ? She was probably eliminated . That 's all . - Yeah , I think she was . - No , I saw her after the cube test . If she is with the Cause , I hope she 's dead . I don 't get those people . - They 're a bunch of fuckers . - They 're ungrateful . The Offshore offers salvation for everyone and they despise it . It 's absurd . Candidate , follow directions to your next test . I saw the agent taking you and Bruna away . If you want to talk later , I 'll be here . - Fernando ? - Yeah . Come with me . They 're taking him . A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES CHAPTER 02 COINS Do you feel anything ? From here on up . Lie on your stomach . - Do you feel anything ? - A lot of pain in my back . And now ? I said I don 't feel anything . And now ? The effect will only last a few minutes . But our medicine is advanced . With the full treatment , you could walk again . But first , you have to pass . Hey . You guys , too ? I was told to come to room four . This is it . - Yes , that 's it . - Is this the guy ? I love you , too , man . Well , if it 's a cheating test , we 're set . Fernando , how did your exam go ? - I 'll tell you later . - You can go in . Whoa . Do you think all the houses on the Offshore are like this ? Candidates . What happened to the woman in navy blue ? Analyze the scene and find out . When you 've come to a conclusion , press the button and state your answer . I think she choked , right ? Wow , you figured that out all by yourself ? Congratulations . Shut up , Rafael . Room 7 : Francisco , Gabriel , Ana , Oswaldo , Clara , Wagner , Mariana , and Pedro . You 've all been eliminated . I guess they had the wrong answer . The answer is here , we just need to look carefully . They have vaccine scars . They are definitely from the Offshore . Fuck . How are we gonna solve this shit ? More than half the candidates are eliminated in this test . Really ? So , most candidates lack basic deduction capabilities ? No , induction . To go from a collective to a single perspective is deduction . From the single to the collective is induction . Do they know they 're being monitored ? They should know , but they don 't . MAY 31 FOUNDERS ' FESTIVAL The 31st is the Founders ' Festival . What 's this ? This is horrible . This rug ... I thought they had good taste on the Offshore . - Sorry , guys . My bad . - You broke it , you idiot ! Careful ! Every detail could be part of the solution . If that 's the solution , we just failed . I said I was sorry . Guys , calm down . It 's not Teo 's fault . He was born stupid . Go fuck yourself . Just leave it , Marco . - Giving up ? - I 'm not getting yelled at . Fuck that . Room 9 : Cecília , Beatriz , Eduardo , Vítor , Caio , Helena , and Artur . You 've been eliminated . Are you okay , Fernando ? What 's wrong ? Stop , Ágata ! I wanted to see what kind of meat it was . - I already said not to touch it . - It 's best we don 't . I just wanted to try it . - If it tastes different , I want to- - - Don 't touch that food ! Trust me . I know what happened here . She was poisoned . By the hostess . Hold on . The hostess ? - This one ? - Exactly . It 's two couples . One are the hosts , the other are guests . - How do you know ? - Two things . Their rings and their shoes . The woman in blue and her husband 's shoes are dirty with mud . They don 't live here , they just came for dinner . Wait , you said she was poisoned . Pay attention . Both men are getting up to help the woman in blue . But she 's only staring at one man . This one . She 's reaching for his hand . When you 're desperate , it 's natural to reach out to the person who 's closest to you . But in this case , it 's not her husband . It 's her lover . They 're having an affair . The hostess found out ... and poisoned the other woman 's food out of revenge . Yeah ... only the woman in blue had sauce on her plate . Exactly . That 's where the hostess put all the poison . So that 's what was on her desk . This is probably the formula for the poison . It makes perfect sense . Just take a close look at the hostess ' facial expression . Look at her , she looks like a murderer . While the two men are getting up to help the other woman , she avoids looking directly at the woman who 's suffering . That 's it . Fuck , Mr. Wheels . And I thought the cube made out of cubes was genius . Yes . You killed it , man . Good one . We didn 't have to do anything . I guess everyone agrees , right ? I 'm gonna press the button . No . Wait ! Wait for what , Rafael ? - That answer is completely wrong . - What ? Here we go , Rafael . Do you really think the Process would show us a scene of adultery and murder that happened on the Offshore ? You 're all idiots . - Do you have a better idea , genius ? - Sure . She wasn 't poisoned . She 's allergic to silver . What ? What do you mean ? - Allergic to silver ? - Right . Everyone at the table has a metal object . All three are wearing watches . A metal necklace . Everyone except for her . Even her ring is made of glass or something . Her necklace is made of wood . She 's wearing a ring made of wood . But not the silverware . They 're made of silver . She didn 't notice and started eating . And now her allergies are blocking her airway . But only the woman in blue had sauce . So what ? Maybe she 's the only one who likes sauce . What 's wrong with that ? And that 's not even true . Look at the hostess ' napkin . - Holy shit . - Check it out . I don 't think she 'd eat her own poison . There 's your guy . My guy ? You allowed him to pass the cube test in quite an unorthodox way . And you think I 'm protecting him ? No , I 'm just kidding . Then why is she staring at the other woman 's husband and not her own ? That 's easy . In fact , you should 've figured that out on your own . He 's a doctor . Those formulas over there aren 't for poison . They 're medical formulas or something . All right , he might be a doctor , but the woman in blue is dying and the hostess is right there , not worried at all . If she didn 't poison her on purpose , how do you explain that , Rafael ? She 's blind . That 's why she 's not looking at the woman who 's choking . She really is blind . Let me see that , Marco . Not everyone would assume there are people with special needs on the Offshore . How did you know that , Joana ? His desk has a lamp on it . Hers doesn 't . That , my friends , is how you solve a case . Without any sauce . Hello . The woman in blue is choking because she 's allergic to silver . The hostess is blind . Her husband is a doctor . And this rug is hideous . Does anyone in the group have a different theory ? No , it 's unanimous . Your answer is correct . But that doesn 't mean everyone made it through . Candidate Teo , you 've been eliminated . What ? What are you talking about ? - Follow me , please . - What ? We got it right . I passed , too ! He 's the one who came up with the wrong answer . He did , but he also helped the group . - You did nothing . - I did . I examined everything . Just because I broke something ? What did you all do ? Do you think this is fair ? The Process is supposed to be fair . The guidelines to overcoming the trauma of elimination will be given to you when you return your uniform . Fuck all of you . We thank you for your participation . So ? What did you think ? - I would have done well on this test . - I agree . Aline , I 'd like to ask a favor . The incident with the mole from the Cause has delayed our schedule . We 're behind on tomorrow 's tests . I was wondering if you could monitor the next test with Álvaro . - Sure . - Is that okay ? No worries . Monitoring will be done from here , okay ? Let me give you a hand . It 's stuck . Give it to me . Told you . I told you . What 's up ? No need to thank me . I know I saved everyone , even you , from your brilliant idea . - Thanks . - It worked . But it was a great story . The sauce , the betrayed woman , the murderer ... But that 's okay . That 's what I 'm here for . Fuck you , Rafael . I 'm serious . This time it was me . Maybe next time , it 'll be you . I mean , I wouldn 't bet on it . But who knows ? - Makes you thirsty , huh ? - Very . Good thing we did well on this test . - It was a hard one . - Yeah . Well ... I 'm gonna go . Later . Hey . That was a close one , huh ? Good thing we were in a smart group . I 'm soaked . I was helping a girl with her water bottle . Are you coming or what ? Are you okay ? I 'd like to be alone . Sometimes when we wanna be alone , all we really need is someone to talk to . I could walk again . What ? - I don 't know . Maybe . - What did you say ? The doctor tested a treatment from the Offshore and I felt my legs . I can 't believe it , Fernando . That 's incredible . It 's wonderful . - You can walk again- - - Michele , why are you so happy ? It took me years to accept that I would never walk again . But I did it . I 've spent my entire life in this wheelchair . This is who I am . And now they tell me that everything can change ? That I don 't have to be myself ? That all the effort I 've put in up to now was for nothing ? Fuck walking , Michele . That 's not why I came to the Process . I came here because I can pass . End of story . ... already did the qualifications . Ezequiel also asked us to run the analysis of group K. Álvaro , how long until the next test ? About five minutes . I 'll go freshen up . Be right back . Okay . What 's this ? Candidates ... this test is simple . You have 15 minutes to decide which one of you should be eliminated . There are a total of six coins for seven of you . When the time is up , only those holding a coin will make it through . After 15 minutes , if you haven 't come to a decision , you will all be eliminated . How do we base our decision ? However you want . The remaining candidates will take the next test as a group . So choose wisely . Good luck . How are we gonna decide ? How are you gonna decide ? I 'm in . No way . No one is in . - Return the coins , Rafael . - Why the fuck would I do that ? Because it 's not fair . We have to choose the criteria together . - You can 't just take a coin . - I think it 's very fair . The test is to take a coin . I took it . You took three coins , you motherfucker . I saw you . Yes , that 's true . Here . There . You can fight for those . But not for mine . Mine is right here . Rafael , stop being ridiculous . - How old are you , two ? - You think this is about who 's first ? I do . Come on , guys . Where did you grow up ? Where I grew up , we 'd just take that from you . Oh , yeah ? I 'm waiting . Let go . Let go ! Let go . Let go . What was that for , Marco ? All you had to do was ask nicely . Go on , Joana . There . Now we decide who goes . Unrestricted access . Councilor Matheus . User Ezequiel . Last camera modifications . View camera . Camera 5970 . Live . What ? Reset . - Next . - Camera 5971 . Live . Reset . Ezequiel ? Reset . Candidates , you have ten minutes remaining . I vote for Rafael . I 'm so shocked . It 's the obvious choice . You walked in and took the coins . On the cubes test , you cheated . In other words , you shouldn 't even be here . You 're all forgetting one thing . If it weren 't for me , none of you would be here . So bash me all you want . Be pissed off at me . Just don 't forget that the next test is a group test . So ? You really want to go in without me ? Fernando . I vote ... for Joana . - Why ? - I despise Rafael . - Thanks . - But Joana doesn 't seem to care . Everyone is putting in all this work and she 's just standing there . Sorry , but if you don 't believe in the Process , - you don 't deserve to be here . - Wait . - Right in front of her . - Why is he doing this ? Damn . As usual , you 're wrong . Joana is worth much more than a lot of you combined . - Why are you defending her ? - You knew her before . - No , no . - You 're together . Of course not ! I 'm sticking up for the group , not her . I want Joana in our group on the next test . - It 's simple . - Are you sure that 's all ? There 's one thing here everyone can see . But no one has the guts to say it . I vote for Fernando . And it 's not even because you almost got us all eliminated . It 's because of the ... - the obvious reason . - What ? You 're sitting on it , Fernando . You have no chance of finishing the Process in that chair . Shut up , Rafael . We just saw a blind woman on the Offshore . - That 's no reason to- - - We saw a doll . Besides , she might have become blind after the Process . Or do you believe a blind person could pass these tests ? What if the next test is physical ? What happens to our group ? Fernando , you 're going to be eliminated . I 'm sorry to say it , but you are , sooner or later . No . The Process will see beyond that . They 'll see that I can do it . I know you believe that . That you need to believe it . It 's a beautiful story , man . But it 's not true . And it 's completely unfair if everyone here is in jeopardy so you can stay in the Process a little longer . You 're not gonna say anything ? Even he knows I 'm right . Does anyone have anything else to say ? Amen ! Because the Process is more than just a selection . Much more . The Offshore offers salvation . And the Process is purification . Because life on the Offshore is just , true , superior . YOU DESERVE IT But in order to be deserving of it , you must believe . Have faith in the Founding Couple . Have faith in the Process . And above all things , have faith in yourselves . Now , let 's close our eyes and picture ... picture yourselves going to the Offshore . Son ... There we go . There . Try it out . No . This life sucks . Hey ! Fernando ! You 're gonna start feeling sorry for yourself now ? Fernando , look at me . What 's the most important thing in life ? - Making it through the Process . - Exactly ! And the Process doesn 't care if you 're in a wheelchair , or if you came flying or jumping . You must have faith in the Process . Son , this chair makes you stronger . It 's your secret weapon . Candidates , you have five minutes remaining . I guess we 're ready to vote . - Who thinks that Fernando- - ? - I want to talk . Do you know why I took so long at the physical today ? They gave me a shot . A treatment from the Offshore , and I could feel my legs . The doctor said that if I make it through to the Offshore , I will walk again . Do you know what that means ? And the doctor believes I can last the entire Process . So , please , guys ... don 't take that away from me . Fernando is right . We barely know one another . And it 's not fair to judge each other . - Even if that person is Rafael . - So , what do we do ? We have to vote someone out . - We draw names . - Draw names ? All this to draw names ? - It 's fair . - Fair ? - Let luck decide . - So , you 're off the hook . Right ? I 'm in . I don 't want to eliminate anyone . You know what you are ? Cowards . - Drawing names sounds good . - Yeah . - Ágata , can I have your scarf ? - What ? Please . Candidates , you have three minutes remaining . The most important moment of our lives decided by a fucking torn-up scarf . That 's great ! Just great ! You have two minutes remaining . Whoever picks the shortest strip is eliminated . Lucas . I passed ! Goddamn ! You have one minute remaining . Rafael . Great idea on the draw . Awesome . Joana . Ten , nine , eight , seven ... six , five , four ... - That 's it . - ... three ... - That 's it . - ... two , one . - Have you made a decision ? - Yes . Good luck on the Inland . What ? Fuck , where 's the coin ? Where 's the coin ? Where 's the coin ? Hold on , she stole it ! She has the coin ! Hold up , Joana ! Tell him we drew names ! Joana ! Get back here , you motherfucker ! Hold on ! She has the coin ! We drew names ! Joana , tell him we drew names ! Motherfucker ! Shit ! Instructions for your recovery include : - Try to not reminisce ... - 952 . ... or comment on the events of the Process . Memories can be very painful . The joy of having children is one of the most efficient methods to deal with frustration . What 's with the faces ? What ? It doesn 't even look like you passed . - Be quiet . - What ? Shut up . You know what this is ? People who can 't enjoy life . What can you do , right , Fernando ? What can you do ? Is there any food around here ? - These tests make me hungry . - What ... ? - Where 's Lucas ? - He didn 't have a coin . Relax . You tried . Reset . What are you hiding , Ezequiel ? - Next . - Camera 5986 . Live . Next . Next . - Next . - Camera 5977 . Live . Reset . Hey , what 's up ? This damn chair is stuck again . Easy ! You passed . Isn 't that what you wanted ? Sure ! I wanted the pity vote after a pathetic speech in front of everyone . " Oh , I really wanna walk again ! " Come on , Michele . That 's exactly what I didn 't want . Since I was a kid , I 've been telling myself : " I 'm going to pass , I can pass . I 'm good enough . " Everyone doubted me , Michele . But then ... But then , what ? What if he 's right ? Who are you talking about ? Everyone . I had to rely on Rafael earlier . I had to rely on everyone 's pity today . I don 't know how much further I can go . Come on , Fernando . Of course you 're gonna go far . You 're not pitiful . You 're strong . It 's not your fault . This place is to blame . They make us do horrible things in here . Michele , what are you talking about ? - The Process is not to blame . - Then who is ? I am ! - I was weak . - You had vision . You did what you had to do . You used their pity to pass . The people who made you do it are the ones to blame . I get it . You 're just saying that to make me feel better . I can tell . Shut up . Hello , Ezequiel . How was the coin test ? It went well . - Were you able to plan tomorrow 's test ? - Yes . We 're back on schedule . Excellent . FACIAL RECOGNITION 100 % NO MATCH I checked all the files . He heads out regularly to the Inland , once a week , and he erases the security footage . He edits the images . Good , Aline . That 's the way ! You need to send me all those images . I will . But his face is never visible . What can we do ? We need proof . You need to find out what Ezequiel is hiding . Right . Subtitle translation by João Neto

 Previously on travelers ... In the future , We 've developed a technology That allows a traveler To project his or her conscious mind ... To a host body . In our time , Humanity has been all but wiped out . We 've come back to change that . Thirty seconds . Till what ? On this night , Special agent grant maclaren fell 45 meters to his death . I see we all made it . Let 's begin . So , any issues I should know about ? Well , intel on my host was way off the mark , But I 'm handling it . We all knew Assuming the lives of people from another century Wasn 't going to be a walk in the park . Actually , you should try a walk in the park sometime . It 's lovely . Thanks . I 'll do that . All coms are set for voice activation . All good ? Yeah . Loud and clear . When did you have a chance to build coms ? After school . Okay . Ready ? Freeze ! The material 's safer where it is . Dr. Delaney , the entire power grid is down And your emergency backups Aren 't designed to last for more than a few hours . Your transport unit is untested . The road vibration alone could cause containment failure . Any distance we manage to take it Is better than here . Bullshit . This isn 't about safety . You want a new weapon . We 're ready to load up , major . Copy . Doctor . Watch those cables there . Agent maclaren ? Yes . You called in that you were in pursuit of a suspect . Do you need backup ? Yes . We were forced to take him out . I ... I was . That 's the body over there . There 's also a police officer Locked out on the roof . Okay . We can take it from here . I 'm traveler 3185 . This is your containment unit . You can trust it . I thought we were meeting en route . No plan survives contact with the past . You must be new . Yes . Six minutes ago . How 's that for timing ? Go save the world . Thanks . No pressure . The convoy is approaching our location . Copy . We 're getting in position . They 're passing us now . Major , the containment unit . It 's failing . What ? We 're detecting micro-annihilations . So she was right . I wouldn 't say that , sir , But we won 't make it to our facility . We 're looking at an explosion In the megaton range . Stop the convoy . : At this point , An antimatter detonation is inevitable . I want everyone to turn around And get as far away from here as you can . Copy that , major . Wilson ! Sir . The road ahead 's clear . I 'll be following just behind . We 'll take it as far as we can . Go . I 'll catch up . You 're not following him ? what ? Nothing . I 'm just looking you over . Well ... He looks like his picture . So how do you feel about older men ? I asked myself that this morning . Agent maclaren came to see me . What ? He 's a lot like you . So much , I almost thought I was talking to you . Well , not as charming , I bet . Oh , he was charming . It even crossed my mind To warn him not to follow us tonight . Well , the next available host candidate Was a morbidly obese meat salesman , So thanks for keeping that thought to yourself . Containment truck historically one minute out . Copy . We 're in position . They 're trying to get outside the blast radius . The truck is on its own now . Okay , guys . Sir , I could use your help up here ! This is wilson . The road ahead was supposed to be clear . I 'm jamming his radio . Does anybody copy ? Lady , you do not want to be here ! I said , you do not- - Okay , he 's out ! Transfer complete . Pick it up , guys . Charge is set . We 're good for roughly 40 hours . Well , that went About as well as I could have hoped . There it is . We 've just officially changed history . We just saved 11,000 people . Except for the guy who was driving that truck . One piece of history that we couldn 't change . At 0830 tomorrow- - Today- - We 'll hand off the antimatter to the arriving team leader And our first mission will be complete . Yeah . Philip and I can handle that . Why ? Well , trevor 's got school , And carly 's got a baby , And you 've got a wife you 've got to go home to And meet for the first time , so- - Okay . You two , do the hand-off . We 'll meet later on . I 'll get you home . Great work , everybody . Hi . Did you have anything to do with the blackout ? No . Then ... Did you ... Have anything to do with the fbi ? An agent called . Said he stopped by earlier . You know , I don 't get A lot of fbi agents calling . Was his name maclaren ? Yes . Would it help you If I told you I work with him ? Yeah , it would . It would help a lot . It would make a lot of sense , actually . And it 's all good , this fbi business ? Yeah , it 's all fine . Okay . Well , it 's late . One more question . Why are you here ? Staying in my apartment . With me . David , there 's going to come a time Where I 'll need your help . My help ? Mm-hmm . I mean , honestly , There 's not that many people I can trust . But if- - if it 's not okay ... No . It 's fine . I wish you could come in . There 's a babysitter . Well , I guess we 'll just have to wait until- - Yep . That 's you , all right . Couldn 't even make it upstairs , huh ? Oh ... I didn 't want to wake you . Tough night ? Uh ... Long night . There you go . Thanks . Oh , no . Is the milk off ? You know , the power was out almost all night . I am going to the fabric store later today . Do you want me to pick up that linen for your mother ? My mother ? That milk is fine . This is cow 's milk . What animal were you expecting ? You know , I don 't know If we 're going to be seeing them this weekend , But I can still pick it up . Yeah , sure . That 's ... That 's great , kathryn . Kathryn ? What ? You haven 't called me By my full name Since our first date . Yeah . What 's that about ? You need to take a nap . You 're not safe to drive when you 're this tired . I 've got to go . I 've got that big meeting today . Good luck . Thank you . Have a great day ... Kat . Take a nap ! Uh-huh . Trevor ! Get up ! I 'm up ! I 'm up ! - I 'm up ! I 'm up ! - Up ! I 'm up , okay ? Breakfast is on the table . Hey , it 's marcy . I 'll meet you at the t.E.L.L. Hey , marcy , don 't sneak out on me . I 've been thinking , And I want you to come to the hospital with me . No . No ? You can 't pretend That you didn 't have a seizure two days ago . I mean , whatever else is going on , That was real , And it wasn 't a little thing . I 'm not gonna pretend that it didn 't happen . You need to see a doctor . I am a doctor . What ? You want to know what a doctor would say ? That I had something like an absence seizure , That the electrical signals in my brain Repeated themselves over and over In a three-second pattern . She 'll be confused Because it 's more common in children than adults , And then she 'll order an mri , Because it 's likely to get worse . Why didn 't you just say that ? Because ... There 's- - There 's just so much more to this ... Then give me a hint . Give me something . I mean , technically , I 'm still your social worker . I could make you go to the hospital . Okay , what 's the date today ? The 13th ? There will be a small commuter plane crash In oregon around noon , With four casualties . If it doesn 't happen , I will go to the hospital with you , okay ? Fair ? That 's ridiculous . I mean , nobody can predict that . Well , then you 'll get what you want , And I will go to the doctor with you . Do we have a deal ? No . I also want your cell number . I don 't have one . You don 't have a cell ? Fine , yours is a secret . Here . Take this . I bought it as a gift for somebody that I used to- - You know , it doesn 't matter . Take it . If it rings , it 's me . Please answer it . Welcome to the 21st . I 'm traveler 3569 . Oh , shit . What do you think , boss ? Of what ? Our operations base . Yeah , it 's breathtaking . You 're sure there hasn 't been a messenger ? I think a pre-adolescent kid Might stand out . I thought this was going to be a simple hand-off ? The director Probably didn 't know about the pills . What pills ? A fatal dose of fentanyl . Probably a failsafe In case he lacked the courage to pull the trigger . The director missed it . Cause of death on historical record Was gunshot to the head . And there wasn 't anyone from his team there to meet him ? No . And we looked around . Well , let 's not panic . The director will be aware that a traveler didn 't make it And assign a new candidate . Yeah , if one comes available in time . You 've memorized all the potential candidates In the area ? I 've memorized everything . Okay . Show off a little . How many since 0830 ? Hmm ... Today 's not a real good day . There was a construction worker That gets electrocuted earlier this morning- - Prime host , actually- - But the accident Is impossible for the incoming traveler to avoid , so ... Report of The construction worker 's death this morning Is already online . In a couple hours , There 's an elective surgery that goes bad . The point is , it could take time . How much do we have ? 30 hours , give or take . We should drive the antimatter out of town , Like the military was trying to do . No . The director must have some sort of plan for it . Probably as a power source . We need to make it possible for the other team to find us . I could throw out something like an s.O.S. On the deep web , But that would risk exposure by the fbi . You know all about that . Try your s.O.S. I can run interference at the bureau if I have to . And we could look at a way To extend the life of the unit With a supplemental power supply . Buy us some time . Good . I 'm going to talk to the traveler That delivered it to us last night . You sure that 's a good idea ? No . Delaney . This is major gleason . I guess you 've been expecting my call . Actually , I was hoping to never to hear from you again . How 's the circle jerk going ? We never had the material , did we ? What are you talking about ? You 're the one who drove away with it last night . Yeah , well , I thought so , too . Why aren 't you off on an island somewhere exploding bombs ? Well , there was an explosion , Just not the one we were expecting . Oh , god ... When ? On our way to our base . How many casualties ? The blast was substantial enough To put my driver into a coma , But we both know It should have been in the megaton range . This didn 't even make the news . I 'm not sure what you 're accusing me of- - That it never existed , or somehow , you hung on to it . Either way , We are going to have a conversation . See you later . Bye , sweetie . See you guys soon . Hey . Protocol 6 , agent maclaren . Can 't officer boyd and special agent maclaren Have a conversation ? Okay , well , first of all , Don 't refer to yourself in the third person . Is this fbi business ? In the sense that they wouldn 't want An antimatter explosion in the middle of town . Are you serious ? Have you been sent a messenger ? Are you authorized by the director to talk to me ? Then step away . Look , the arriving traveler we were meeting was d.O.A. In the absence of a clear course of action , You await instruction from the director Via messenger or traveler . What else do you want me to tell you ? How about the location Of the team that we were supposed to hand off to ? I don 't know , And I 'm not supposed to know . Look , you 're new , I get it , I really do , And you got a bitch of a first assignment , But I 've been here a year , and shit happens , okay ? There 's a reason We 're so compartmentalized , maclaren . There 's teams of us all over the world on missions , And that 's why- - That 's why there 's a protocol six . Yeah , I get the rules , But help me out here . Should we drive it to an unpopulated area ? Or leave it where it is and risk wiping out a city ? It 's a tough call . Get it right , please . Aviation authorities agree That if it were not for the skill of the pilot , This tragedy could have been much worse . With just four dead , Local authorities are grateful The pilot managed to bring the commuter plane down In a remote area . Names of the dead have not yet been released Pending notification of the families ... You all right ? You 're sweating . I 'd like it if there was no bomb in my house , But otherwise ... Philip . I think we are ready to do this . You got a cell phone ? Yeah . Who could be calling you ? It is my social worker . Yes ? How could you have possibly- - Possibly known that was going to happen Unless you had something to do with it happening ? I can 't tell you that . Marcy , this is crazy . We made a deal That if it happened , I wouldn 't have to go to the hospital with you today . Yes , but- - but I didn 't expect this . Yeah . Well , it happened . You asked for a hint , I gave you one . Look , I really need to go . No . Just one more question . This fbi business ? Is it dangerous ? Well , that depends on- - Marcy , what 's happening ? What happened ? His hands just started shaking . I think he shorted out the circuit . He 's in cardiac arrest . - Marcy- - - : Go grab my bag . Marcy ? Marcy ? Come on , philip . Philip , stay with us . Marcy ? Come on . Marcy ? Come on ... Come on . He 's back . Speak up , trevor . We didn 't add time . We lost it , and there 's not much left . I don 't know what happened . It was like a tremor . My hand just jumped from the connectors . Shorting out our supplemental power supply And draining the unit 's capacitor . I am so sorry , guys . Could you start over ? Not in the few hours we have . What did you get out of boyd ? Only that I was In gross violation of protocol six And we should solve our own problems . I think the solution now Is to get that thing at a safe distance . Carly , If that 's what the director wanted us to do , Wouldn 't he have sent a messenger by now , Telling us to do it ? Which means there 's another solution We haven 't thought of . Yeah . One that we will think of in the next five hours . If we 're down to hours , There 's no safe place for the antimatter Other than far away . Yes , there is . And it 's obvious . Where it was created . Delaney 's lab ? That 's insane . Is it ? I mean , the whole facility Was designed to store antimatter for an unlimited amount of time . And it 's a half hour away in traffic . I 'm sure the team We were supposed to hand this off to Must have had other plans . Well , no plan survives Contact with the past . Can you find us a map of the van huizen compound On this antique ? Okay , one , this equipment is currently state of the art , And two , Wouldn 't you rather I just hack into their main computer system ? Oh . Yes , please . Okay , I don 't want To shoot a hole in our only idea here , but- - How do we do this Without delaney knowing we did it ? I 'm already In violation of protocol six today , Maybe I should just tell her . Oh , no . What is it ? The school called my mom . I missed a science test yesterday . I 'm in ! I could shut down the security system . I could probably shut down their power ... But what might be most useful Is a flood In the high-pressure water coolant supply Of building 26 . What do you think ? What the hell ? Okay . See you , jason . Your friend is determined . Yeah . There . He gave up . What exactly does a librarian need With a social worker ? My host 's identity was fiction . The product of ... A character-building exercise In social media , In which her case Was our primary source of information . In reality , marcy ... Is a mentally-challenged woman Living in the care of the state . How is that not a giant problem ? Long term , it 's most certainly fatal . I mean , not today or the next day . I plan on telling maclaren Once I 've properly diagnosed myself I just need somebody to know in case I have another seizure . We all our have burdens . Yours is no easier . I 'm a doctor , I know the symptoms . I 'm dealing with it . Well , I want you to dose before we go . To keep your hands from shaking . Today is not the day you want to quit . You know , I 'm not crazy About the idea of getting in bed with a mass murderer . Who ? Delaney ? You 're forgetting we changed history . It never happened . She still created The most destructive weapon in history . If the military Hadn 't taken it farther away- - That 's their horse shit story . Delaney was a scapegoat . It was their own containment unit that failed . History just bought into their version of the story . I 've seen her in those old history docs . The woman 's got all the charm Of a foaming yeast vat . Turn left up here . Hey . How 's your day going so far ? We 've got something here about flooding in building 26 . I.D.S , please ? Sure . Fourteen gallons of water per minute . Tick tock . Go ahead . Afternoon , sir , I 'm with ftra . Go ahead . Okay then . Okay , guys , I 've hacked into the security systems . No workers where we want to be . All right . Keep your eyes and your coms open . Come on . Looks like the interface is up top . You stay right where you are . Shit . South door . Go . I already shut off the relief valve That had been opened remotely , So you don 't need to bother going through the motions . So , major dickless Didn 't have the balls to do this himself ? If you mean major gleason , Who took your antimatter last night , no . In fact , we 're the ones who took it from him . The material is in that black bag On my associate 's shoulder . In a bag that size ? no . It is pretty heavy . My other associate Has a .9mm aimed at your back . Marcy , would you just aim The laser guide of your weapon At me for a second ? We stopped a disaster last night , And to prevent another one , We need to get this material back where it belongs . Who the frig are you people ? My name is maclaren . I 'm with the fbi . My team has been tasked at the highest level To prevent the military from building The most powerful weapon of mass destruction in history . The teenager is fbi ? Just me . They 're specialists . Show me your credentials . We prevented the deaths Of thousands of people last night , Not to mention an arms race ... But our portable containment unit Has a limited battery capacity . Show it to me . Yeah . Is it supposed to be flashing like that ? We don 't have much time . We need to transfer it now . How could you possibly create a stable magnetic bottle Inside something so small ? Somebody 's here ! It 's one vehicle , And the driver 's alone . Military . Copy . Take no action . A vehicle 's just pulled up outside . It 's gleason . I thought he sent you people to steal my research . How much time do we have ? It 's not like there 's a clock on the thing . Minutes . There won 't be a warning , it 'll just go boom . You need to get rid of him as quickly as possible . That 's all I ever do with him . Come on . Where 's your staff ? We had a small coolant leak . I sent everyone home while these people clean up . Can you guys be somewhere else for a few minutes ? You 're fine . Go back to work . They don 't give a shit what we have to say , And , frankly , I 'm a little afraid To be alone with you . That 's funny , I feel the same way . Go see for yourself that it 's not here So you can leave . We don 't have time for this . Not yet . All right . So , if I never had it , and it 's not here , Then the only other possibility- - What is that sound ? I lied . It never existed . Material seemed to be accumulating , But with each new anti-particle we created , There were quantum micro-annihilations That went unrecorded . We have to take him out . I said , wait . I didn 't want to lose our funding And thought we were making progress , But , at best ... We don 't have time for this . ... You drove off with a milligram . I know how hard That must have been for you to confess , And on that level , I must admit I enjoyed that a little . But I do believe you were close , And we want you to continue your work . That means you won 't be rid of me for a while . Can I at least be rid of you now ? Of course . Major dickless is leaving . Is the containment unit powered up to 120 mev ? We left it fully charged In case the transfer wasn 't a hundred percent . How long is this going to take ? I don 't know . Done . It 's back . Huh . I kind of thought that would be a bigger deal . Nope . Empty . 10.3 grams of antimatter . Perfectly stable . How close did we come ? I already told you , there 's no way of knowing . It was pretty close , though . Doctor , I can 't emphasize enough how important- - Fbi , my ass . Who are you people ? Blondie over there can 't be much over 20 . And the technology beefcake carried in on his shoulder Doesn 't exist . Well , obviously , it does . Look , all you need to know at this point Is that I am with the bureau , The task force is top secret , And this won 't be the last you hear from us . Just keep the material safe for now . For now ? What does that mean ? As in out of the hands of the military And off the front page of the paper . Look ... If you need to reach me , Or you want our help , There 's my number . But I 'll probably be calling you first . I 'll hold my breath . By the way , We were this close to intervening . You just saved his life . Who ? Gleason ? Oh , great , that makes my day . Did you get my text ? Yeah , sorry . I got busy . Well , the doctors did say You 'd get back to your old self . I was making some tea . Do you want some ? Please . So ... Did you save him ? Hmm ? I only ask Because I heard you Administering cpr to someone named philip , Who apparently had a cardiac arrest Before the phone went dead , And then you didn 't answer for the rest of the day . Yeah , he 's- - he 's fine . Oh , good . Good . So , what 's on the agenda for tomorrow ? Uh ... I was thinking about what you said , And tomorrow , I 'm going to go to the hospital . Do you want me to take you , Or ... Do you want to rappel down a rope from a helicopter ? No . I would like you to take me . Please . Hi . Sorry I 'm late . Okay . Oh , thank you . I 'll see you tomorrow . Okay . Okay . I 'm home ! What ? My husband ? Actually home for the evening ? No ... Hi . Hi . Hi . What are you- - this is a nice surprise . You get that , I 'll go pour us a glass of wine . Hello ? Traveler 3468 . Mission outcome acceptable in light of extenuating factors . Further breach of protocols may result in punitive action . End of message . Who are you ? I 'm the guy you 're going to sell those cookies to , I think . Sweetheart , I bought two boxes from you Half an hour ago . You 've already done this side of the street . Okay , bye . Both of which You 're going to take to the office with you tomorrow . If they stay in this house , I 'll eat them all . If you insist ... So , how was your day ? You know what ? My day was boring . I 'd rather hear about yours . Tell me everything .

 This is my mother 's murder case file . Jim Stepton ! My first case , your last . Karl Frierson brought you in . Every time I followed something , he blocked it . Frierson wanted to kill it ? Nothing I could prove . I want you to come in for questioning . It 's in connection with the murder of Luke Bangura . You are delusional and when this farce is over , I will make it my personal mission to have you removed from duty . My office , detective Clayton ! - What ? - Now , Clayton ! He is rotten ! A client of mine was an inmate here . Kevin Grey ? I think you know how he died . It was Golding . For the last 3 years , I 've been tracking a man called Golding . I 'm certain ... he ordered my mother 's death . The same man that killed Freddie Lau , the same man that wants the bracelet ? I 've never been able to find out who he really is . Yeah , I don 't know how long I 'm gonna be . There 's been an incident . The traffic 's backed up across the bridge . Just keep the road . You shout when you see him . Help me ! - Go away ! What you 're doing ? - Please ! Help me ! Give me your phone ! Jesus Christ ! - Give me your phone , now ! - No ! No ! Go away ! Come on , please ! Please ! Over here ! Help ! They 're coming ! They 're coming ! Here he is ! Whoa , whoa ! Right ! That 's far enough ! Don 't shoot ! Someone beat him , doused him in petrol . The spark from the taser ignited the vapour . So the poor guy gets loose only for one of our lads to blow him up ? - 500 mil of normal saline to run over 6 hours . 5 minutes . Hello . I 'm Detective Inspector Clayton . This is Detective Sergeant Chohan . What 's your name , son ? Dear god ! Look at him . This could be the glass they picked out of him ? Smacked with a bottle while they were beating him maybe ? I don 't think so . This is plate glass . I 'd say he went through a window . Easy , easy , easy , son ! Easy ! You 're safe now . Who were you running from ? Ggg ... Go-Golding . Original air date : 2016 , March 4 Sub by mielb It 's awful ! Mum keeps being nice and Nikhail wants to take us to the zoo . Nikhail ? That 's how I have to call him now . That 's my friend Carey . - Hello , Carey ! - Dad ! Go on , now . Suri , any joy with legal ? Yes , the post-mortem showed he was attacked before he was tasered . Good . Following up on the glass fragments , I 've just spoken to a glazier who was called out to fix a broken window in a derelict house near Albert Bridge . They 're worried about a broken window ? The place is a bloody wreck . Ideal for beating though . No-one will ever hear you scream . Can I help you ? Zack McGinnis ? What of it ? Aggravated burglary . 7 years , White Cross prison . Do you remember me ? Well , I got rehabilitated . I was out in four . And now you 're a security guard . Re-purposed for my skills . Open up . Does the firm know you 've got a record ? I think I got straight from the White Cross outreach program . Sent me on a course . Gave me a uniform . And a twitchy nervous dog . She 's a rescue . Little pet ! I found this broken this morning . So I called the glaziers to fix it . Broken in or out ? Looks like someone went through it . Gina ! Hey ! Gina , come on ! Wait ! I 'll go with him . I 'll check outside . Rats ! She smells rats , she 's away . What 's this smell ? It 's petrol ? What 's up there ? I don 't know . No-one goes up there . They do now . Move ! No-one comes up here ? This got nothing to do with me ! I 'm gonna go call my boss . Oy ! I 'll make any calls . Come back . Give that dog a bone . Any luck with the prints ? They 've cut the fingers off to take back to the lab . I reckon they 've had results from worse . Is that him ? Yeah . Last use of the card , 3 hours before they taser him . If we 've traced the card , why do we need the prints ? Because it isn 't his card . Watch this . That 's a bit OTT for a cash point mugging . Yeah ! It 's a boutique bank in Mayfair and the charge card for the cash limit of 10,000 Pounds . The card belongs to a Miss Indira Kamal . She 's a student . Fancy place for student digs ! You should have seen mine ! Hello ! What 's this about ? We recovered a charge card in your name . Are you aware of losing one ? Hmm . I don 't think so . Maybe . I don 't keep track . Suri ... Do you recognize this man ? His name is Anton Bugstrum . He 's from Sweden . Who are you , sir ? Joaquin Agosto . You 're a student too . Si . We all are . I 'm sorry to tell you but Anton is dead . How ? We 're still working on that . Does Anton have any relatives in London ? No that I know . Well , where did he study ? Live ? Perhaps you didn 't know him quite as well as you thought . That was weird . Yeah . Finds out Anton 's stealing from her , doesn 't blink . Is this some ransom gone wrong ? No . Kidnappers wouldn 't torture their asset . You do that for punishment or revenge . Prints section 's got a match for one of the fingers . So our dead Swedish boy has a history of fraud and petty thefts and his name wasn 't Anton , it was Tony . Tony from Dalston . You can 't start an action without making an official complaint . You know the rules as well as anyone . Rules can be bent . I 'm gonna pretend I didn 't hear that . Look , I can 't go running to the authorities . I am the authority . Clayton is a loose cannon , don 't you have enough on him by now ? He 's also an effective officer with the luck of the Devil . You can 't dislodge him that easily . Sometimes wonder if you might be happier in a different line of work . Don 't waste your time wondering . It isn 't your call . I might surprise you . Surprise me with one of these . - Find a way to get rid of him . And keep my name out of it . Tony from Dalston . Doesn 't quite have the playboy ring to it . Expensive taste though ! Oh dear ! We 've got to give him credit for aiming high ! The guy that nicked my Visa went to Nando 's . He 's got fake student IDs for every high-end college in town . He 's been Anton , Antoine , Anton , Anton ... Adonis ? So he mixes with the rich foreign students by posing as one of them . He 's been Italian , Latvian , Swedish and American , whatever suits the con . Yeah , we 'll have to seal the flat and seize the contents . Oh yeah ! Anything on the laptop ? No . Password-protected . Nice watch . It 's got an inscription . " To Sasha . " Think that 'll be useful ? - IT guy had this for you . Thanks . Hum , so ... what led Harry to ... set his sight on the deputy-mayor ? Whatever you can tell me ... doesn 't have to go any further . There 's this one retired officer who used to work with Frierson . Jim Stepton ? It all seemed to take off after Harry bumped into him . There you go . What 's that ? - A password cracker . - Alright . The brute force algorithm on this one runs 8 million guesses a second , so this shouldn 't take too long ! Right . Anything useful ? He made films with each of his targets . Indira Kamal , date of birth , place of birth , mother 's middle name , all the questions they ask you in bank security . Play the video . Ha ha ha ! Well , Indira and Joaquin ! Hidden camera . Tony filmed the women he robbed ! In flagrante , that dirty dog . I 'm in the wrong job . It 's blackmail , Harry . Think about the backgrounds some of these girls come from , traditional values ... Any hint of this gets out , and they 're on the next plane back home . Have a look for the one called Sasha . Harry , it 's supposed to be in evidence . Yeah . Well , there 's an inscription on the back . To Sasha in friendship . From Golding ? Oh look ! There it is . There ! See ? Sasha . Oh my god ! It 's Joaquin . They 're a team . Right . Joaquin suggests the girls . Tony nips in , plunders the fortune . If the girls are anything like Indira , they 're inexperienced and unsupervised . Yeah , and they 're a long way from home . So , do we think one of the other girls may be angry enough to have ordered a hit ? I wouldn 't rule it out . Who 's Golding , Harry ? I really don 't know . Come on , Harry . First , we hear from the guy in the hospital this morning , then he turns up on the back of a watch . And each time his name is mentioned , I can practically hear your mind working the angles . I think it 's a cover name for a seriously dangerous career-criminal operating on a lot of different fronts . So why I 'm having to prise this out of you ? Because I don 't have one solid fact that I can share with you . Hello ? Do you remember Indira 's birthday from her file ? It 's never that easy . That 's what I would try . That never happens for me . Indira ? Miss Kamal ? Suri ! They 've gone down the fire escape . I would have got you one in , but ... Not at this hour . We don 't all have the luxury of early retirement . Your message said that you wanted to pick my brains about the Marsland brothers . Yeah , not strictly true . Then ... what ? Karl Frierson . Harry Clayton came to see you , didn 't he ? We bumped into each other . Harry pulled up an old case , the murder of Maria Alexandri . I saw that he requested the files . That case was reassigned to you and Karl Frierson . Was that what he wanted to talk about ? I need to get on . Harry has his faults ... and , believe me , he has ... many . But he has a nose for these things . Sometimes ... it 's not the job , but everything else that compromises you . Makes you ... vulnerable . And then , people like Frierson either become your friend ... or your enemy . What did he make you do ? Harry was right . There was a suspect . The Alexandri case could have been solved . We 've got two Dalston boys conning money out of rich foreign students . Joaquin ... Jeff Hartley , also known as Jed , two juvenile convictions for twocking , with Tony as co-defendant . Jed romances the kids . Tony sweeps the assets with the sex tape as insurance against repercussions . Then we come ... to Sasha . Sasha Terekhova , of Saint-Petersburg . Tony gathers the details . But what he should have picked up on is her father owns the biggest adult cable network in Eastern Europe . And that 's the respectable end of the business . How is this for a theory ? The boys pick Sasha Terekhova as a mark , but she is no pushover . The Terekhova family have a London connection , and that 's Golding . They lift Tony and torture him to give up Jed . Tony escapes . Golding 's men are probably out on a hunt for Jed right now . With Indira caught in the middle . Well , all the more reason to proceed with care . You can stop pretending . Go ahead and cry if you want to . I know what Anton meant to you . Maybe later . What 's going on ? I don 't understand . We ran from the police . You didn 't even wait to find out what happened . I lost a dear friend to an accident . What do the details matter ? They don 't send detectives out for an accident . Anton and I ... we may have annoyed some bad people . I need to get far away from London . You should probably get far away from me . I 'm not leaving you . Just be honest with me . I can survive . Probably . Even though I still can 't access my trust fund , not since my father ... you know , - the big argument . - I have all the money we need . We could go abroad . Monaco ... Monte-Carlo . Wherever you say . Somewhere warm . With a casino . So , this is Sasha 's London residence . Yeah . How we 're gonna play this ? Cagily . So don 't rock the boat ! You asked for an interview with Miss Terekhova ? - You are ? - A friend of her father 's . He 's asked me to look after her while she 's in London . Do we have a problem ? Not from me . Aleksandra Terekhova . I prefer Sasha . You 're the policeman ? D.I. Clayton . Do you recognize this ? I have one like it . We found it in a dead boy 's flat . He and his mate made a practice of befriending rich young women and defrauding them . Would you know anything about that ? I don 't have many friends . My parents expect me to study . But these boys target students . The farther away from home , the better . Look around , Mr Clayton . Do I seem ... vulnerable to you ? Where are you a student ? The Courtauld Institute , to study Fine Arts . Is this a questioning under coercion , detective Clayton , or are we just ... having a chat ? - You 're well up on the law , Ms Terekhova . - Sasha . If you 've been deceived , Sasha , your parents don 't need to know . But we are investigating a murder . So , you 're not asking for my help to punish these thieves . I think one fatal punishment is more than enough . Well , good luck with your version of justice , detective . Could I have my watch now ? Yeah , could you confirm it 's yours ? Who is ... Golding ? Perhaps I got the wrong Sasha . Perhaps you do . Now , will you give me a call if you have ... an epiphany ? Sure . I 'd say we 've been stonewalled . Ah , it 's a text from Anna . Should have let our own people handle this . The point was not to put yourself at risk . Oh ! I can 't ... Please , Miss Terekhova . We value your father 's friendship . I won 't deny that our men botched the job . They 'll suffer for that . Now all I ask is to set this right . You had your chance . Papa can deal with the policeman . You see ? That 's what I mean . Forgive me , Sasha , but you 're a long way from home . You shove a British policeman under a bus , and there are consequences . Especially if that man is Harry Clayton . You let me take care of him . I 've only got a few minutes . - What 's so urgent ? Is it Daisy ? - No , no , she 's fine . Listen , you know the outreach program means I 've been spending a lot of time at White Cross . Yeah , I was aware of that . Well , turns out you were right about the Kevin Grey suicide . Does the name Golding mean anything to you ? Why ? I got it from one of the inmates . I asked him how Grey died and he said it was Golding . - He was really scared , Harry . - OK , stop right there ! I really think I 'm onto something , I just need to get these people to trust me . - This is incredibly dangerous , Anna . - It 's not dangerous . - Walk away from this now , please . - Harry , I 'm not just doing this for you . I understand that , but just because you 're seeing Governor Julian doesn 't - mean that you can be protected . - I 'm not seeing Governor Ju ... Oh , my god ! - I don 't have time for your jealousy . - No , it 's got nothing to do with that ! Listen to me . It is not that ! Listen , Anna , you don 't understand . I understand perfectly well . You asked me to help and I helped . Someone just tried to access Indira Kamal 's account . They 're in a hotel . OK , let 's get to them before they get kicked out . Right . So , you 're gonna tell me what 's going on ? Golding 's name came up again . We 're close , I can feel it . He 's playing too many tables , stepping on too many cracks . I can 't work like this . - Like what ? - Listen to yourself . When you 're not keeping secrets , you 're talking in riddles ! It 's gambler 's logic , Harry . Runs of luck and winning streaks ? It 's all in your mind . No it doesn 't . He 's out there . That 's why we need to formulate a proper plan to catch him , not just ... chase down every hunch you get and hope for the best . A man like this doesn 't play by any hard and fast rules . Oh my God ! What are you doing ? ! Watch it ! Asshole ! - You 're alright ? - Yeah ... yeah . Sorry ... Sorry . It went out of control . OK ? - You 're alright ? - Fine . It 's OK . Suri , it 's fine . Thanks . What the hell was that ? Why did you let go of the wheel ? The brakes locked , it was the only ... That 's bullshit ! You just totally relinquished control of the vehicle . Well , I panicked , sorry . You knew what you were doing ! You stopped me from grabbing the wheel ! Because you could have flipped us over . - So you just left it all to chance ? - Alright ... I 'm driving . Hello , Paul . So , you 're my escort for the evening , are you ? Your housekeeper wasn 't even a little bit shocked . Your mum was so lovely . As was yours . So ... It 's been a while . I 've ... been in hiding . It 's a good thing too . You rather upset people when you gave the bracelet to the detective . Which people specifically , Paul ? Who 's Golding ? Maybe it 's me . No , we 've known each other since we were children . You can stop pretending . I know you 're afraid . Don 't protect him . Paul , Golding wants the bracelet . He 's going to try and kill Harry , force me to give it to him . Harry 's strong now . Paul , you know what the bracelet can do . If you help us , we can take him down . Our room keys don 't work . Sort it out . Which room is it ? The presidential suite . I 'm sorry , sir . The lady 's card 's been declined . Try it again . Do you have another means of payment ? Look , do you know who her father is ? We could buy this entire hotel and have you fired . That would work too . Anton had my other card . Look , let us into the room , we can call the bank and sort it out . - Call someone . - Who ? Any of your friends . We need cash . I can 't just ask my friends for money . Fine . We stand here , then ... Make the call ! Is Joaquin even your name ? Call me what you like . We need travelling cash , or you 're looking at a dead man . - No , no , no , you don 't . - Let go of her , Jed . Don 't end up like Tony , son . Who sent the dogs on us ? Was this Sasha ? You tell us . That bitch said she knew someone . And she wasn 't kidding . Excuse me , what 's going on ? Police , stay where you are . - Suri ! - Let go of me ! - Suri ? - I 'm fine , go ! Jed , Jed ... Thought you were supposed to be a charmer ? You 're just a thug who hits women . I can do a lot worse if you push me . You 're already in a hole . Stop digging . Suri ? Suri ! Suri . You ! Stay right where you are ! Fuck off ! We 're in love . No , let me ! Let go of me ! Suri ! I really think you should go to hospital . No , I 'm fine . - No , no , no ... - Get in the bed . Come on . It 's fine . It 's fine . You need to sleep . I just need 5 minutes . Yeah , yeah ... Other foot . Come on . Kaleem , it 's Jed . I was wondering when I was gonna get your call . It 's all gonna beat a long good Friday for you , hasn 't it ? Look , I need a couple of passports . You 're shit out of luck , son . My passport guy is on indefinite leave . Well , then find another ! Name the price . Two passports and a safe way to France . Train , boat , plane , anything . How can you pay ? Got me a meal ticket . Her dad 's a five times billionaire . Indian steel magnate or some such . The point is ... she 's good for it . 100 ... Pounds ? thousand . For two bits of paper and a Channel op ? What happened to " name your price " ? Take it or leave it . Yeah , OK . I 'll be in touch . - Could I help you , sir ? - No , I 'm waiting for someone , thanks . It 's late so , ... I 'll get to the point . Harry Clayton . Your friend and mine . Everyone wants to see him taken down . But no-one seems to be able to lay a glove on him . You 're not telling that to my boss . Seems to think I can work miracles . Frankly , I don 't think your boss has the stomach to do what it takes . Question is : do you ? Well , that depends . What ? On what 's in it for you ? On where it begins and ends . I 'm looking for an honest man with honest ambitions . But look , Det . Superintendent Winter 's put the job on your shoulders . Why do you think that is ? I 'm sure you 're about to tell me . He 's a careful man . He 's thinking of the inquiry when Clayton finally implodes . Someone must be seen to have failed . And it isn 't going to be him . I 'd like to see a better man in that job . Kaleem ? Remind me ? Mr Collins , you might remember me . We have a mutual friend . Yeah , what 's it about ? You 're looking for someone . He needs my help to get some rich girl out the country . I told him 100,000 . 100,000 for two passports ? Well , I like your style . Well ... I 'll tell you what , Kaleem ... You text me his number and I 'll take it from there . If Harry Clayton comes sniffing around , you tell him nothing . You understand ? My lips are sealed , Mr Collins . I thank you ... and my employer thanks you . But I doubt very much Jed will want to thank you . So , when your mother was murdered , Frierson was the officer running the investigation . He sat there and held my hand ... Told me he would do everything humanly possible to find her killer . He did everything possible to shut it down . He succeeded . I was so new to the department ... I had no idea what he was doing . He had a rotten heart . No wonder he needed another . It was his kidney but ... yeah . I assumed he really got them on that . The downside is that ... he now knows that I 'm onto him . He couldn 't be Golding , could he ? Hiding in plain sight ? You could say the same thing about Paul Lermontov . And an amount of others . That 's why you have to be careful . The bracelet may give you protection , but no-one is invincible . It 's done a pretty good job so far . He can 't resist it . Look , he 's meeting more than half-way . Just give him a chance , OK ? I asked for popcorn , but they only had pretzels . Pretzels are fine . We 're having fun ? Daisy ? Of course , we are . A day in the park . What 's not to like ? It 's a park . I should probably get this . You go ahead . Come on , Daisy , let 's go find the ducks . Harry , what you 're doing ? It 's Saturday morning . Are you at the zoo ? No . I 'm only asking . I just want to check that Daisy is OK . Look , I ... We had a long talk and I explained that I 've just been working very closely with Nikhail and she shouldn 't read too much into the friendship . You wonder she 'd buy that ? So what do you reckon ? Do ducks like pretzels ? Does anyone ? I 'm not your enemy , Daisy . Can 't we just get along ? Is that so hard ? What 's going on ? Feed the lawyer . Tuppence a bag . Don 't mind if I do . Two teas . Thanks , love . Here . Look I really think you need to go and see a doctor . I 'm fine . Suri , you 've had a serious blow to the head . Thanks , love . You should take some time off . D.I. Clayton . I wasn 't entirely honest with you . Miss Terekhova . I want to make a statement . Can we meet ? Come to the station . Not an official one . Why am I not surprised ? Meet me at the marina . OK , I 'll meet you there . Where are we going ? You 're not going anywhere . You need to rest . Here , eat up . I 'll call you later , OK ? Kaleem says he 's booth number 54 . No ! No more ! It 's too late for that ! I 'll pay you to let me go . Yeah , with what ? I still have money . You 're the only reason I can 't get to it . Yeah , we 'll discuss it on the way over . Here we go . 54 . Well ! This is more like it . Hello ? Come on ! How far can you go without a crew ? Stop , go , forward , back ... How hard can it be ? Kaleem , you have surpassed yourself . How do I start this thing ? This isn 't Kaleem , but it 's nice to be appreciated . Who are you ? You really don 't need to know . See a towel ? Lift it . What 's going on ? You deal with the detective and you 're on your way to France . What detective ? Miss Terekhova ? Sasha ? I knew I was being set up . What about you ? Shut up ! Where is Indira ? Here . You 're OK ? So what 's the deal , Jed ? You shoot me for them and all is forgiven ? Sounds fair to me . It 's not so easy to shoot someone with a handgun , Jed , despite what you see in the films . Go ahead . Take your best shot . Stop talking ! Maybe I 'll get lucky ... Maybe you will . But I should tell you , when I get lucky , someone always loses out . Again ! Last chance . Let 's send Indira down and let 's talk about Golding . No ! Come on ! Come on ! I 've got you . I 've got you . You 're good . That 's it . Come on ! Forgive me . You 've served your purpose , Jed . I 'm afraid I lied about it , doing only good though . You 're OK ? Hello , lover ! Harry , uniform have found Jed 's body at the derelict house . Zack McGinnis . They killed the guard as well . It 's an execution staged as suicide . It 's Golding . He 's covering his tracks .

 Richard will die in the big house . - He 's free as long as you bring me Walsh . - Deal . Looks like you 're going to Beacon . Terminate Walsh . I 'll take care of the traitor . I noticed I 'm missing a finger . What the f ... This is wrong ! I will find a very special job for you , Gerry . Hey , pretty lady . Aah ! Gerry . I hate getting maced . Yeah , I know , Gerry , everyone does . But that 's what you get for creeping up on me ... and at night ? Sorry , but ... Yeah , it still hurts . Yeah , yeah , stay down . Where were you ? We were supposed to meet at the diner to talk about us . Gerry , I showed up . But I was just at the diner . And you weren 't there ! What ? You were there just now ? Yeah . Like we said . I waited almost an hour . No , no . Gerry , we were supposed to meet four days ago . Four days ? No . If it 's been four days , then my beard would 've ... My beard grew . Lost time . I lost mothereffing time ! Do you realize what this means ? - You were abducted ? - I was abducted ! We got to get the group back together ! It is back together . Wow ! That 's good news . What a difference four days makes . Yeah , it is good news for you , but it 's bad news for us ... You know my whole thing about dating other experiencers ... You don 't date other experiencers ... I 'm an experiencer . Did you get it ? I missed my finger . We should grab a celebratory burger . Someone might see you . I don 't care . Nancy , you 're back together ! You 're addicted to junk food . I am ! God , I love it so much . Forgive me , Father , for I have missed you . Ch ... What 're you doing here ? I 've been having impure thoughts . Okay , I 'm working . - I 'm sorry , I wanted to see you . - Yeah , I want to see you , too . But this is not the time or place . We need to set up a ... Not here . Not here . Okay . Um , how about dinner ? Yes , okay . In another town . - Where no one knows who we are . - Obviously . Okay . Go ... Go in ... Go in peace , my child . Make reservations . Where is it ? Hey , do you guys have any security cameras ? No . Why ? Somebody stole something from my room . All right , well , did anyone happen to turn in a missing ... - finger ? - A finger ? Yes . Yep . Somebody stole your finger ? Not my finger . A finger . Well , check out the lost and found . We got sunglasses , got a lighter , got a flipflop . Sorry . No finger . Hey , I got your text . Yeah , we should get together and catch up . I 'm starting to feel ready to show my face in public again . Let 's meet at the abandoned construction site on the north side ? The one that 's about 1 / 4 mile from the taco place with the 3foot churros . I 'll text you the time . Great . I think I 'm done . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Hey ! Not bad , Glimmer . That was fun . That was my first time ironing a face . Remember , I get two hours with him , then you arrest him . - Sound fair ? - I 'm sorry , was it fair that Walsh stole thousands of dollars - from innocent people ? - So an hour ? Was it fair that he lived on a yacht he bought with people 's life savings ? - Half an hour ? - That 's fine . - Thank you . - But I have to be there . All right , but I think you 're gonna be disappointed . I 'm just gonna be talking to him about alien stuff . Sure . Whatever . Fine . I 'll set it up and I 'll text you later . " I 'll text you later " ? No . This isn 't an online date , Ozzie . I 'm sure that line works with your various " Ambers " and all your little " Tiffanis " and whatnot , but I 'm not letting you out of my sight , until I get Walsh . If you 're gonna follow me to group , you might as well handcuff yourself to me . I feel like you 're flirting with me right now , and I want you to know it 's just not the time . Not flirting . Never the time . Unhunh . Hey , why 's there a cake ? I brought the cake . - Gerry ! - Gerry ! - Gerry ! - Hey ! Gerry 's back ! - Yeah . Yep , I see him . - Welcome . Gerry , where ya been , man ? ! Indeed , Kelly . Where have I been . Who here has been on a spaceship ? Please show your hands . Kabam ! That 's right ! I 'm officially a member of StarCrossed . Wow . Gerry , please , sit . We really honor your excitement , and ... and I don 't want to " dis your bliss . " Sometimes you want something so bad that you think it 's actually real . Like ... Like a hysterical pregnancy , or ... No , Gina , it 's real . I 'm having all the classic symptoms of an abduction ... Headaches . An uncontrollable craving for citrus fruits . Random nosebleeds . - It 's great ! - It seems great , but if it is in fact true , then you have a long , therapeutic journey ahead of you . Exactly . I 'm excited . Which is why I have to find a sponsor ASAP . Kelly , before I cross you off the list , - can I ask you a question ? - No , just take me off the list . Very well . Do you think that we are far enough away from Beacon ? I don 't think there 's anyone we know here . That 's why I made the reservation under " Susannah Marmalade . " It 's clever . Should we order some wine , or are you sick of wine ? Because priests drink a lot of wine . We ... To be honest , I 'm more of a beer guy . - Really ? - Yeah . See , I didn 't know that . Okay , now you ask me something . Okay . Um ... how did you meet your husband ? Is that weird ? - No , no , it 's okay . - Are you sure ? Yep . Um ... we met at the Miss Connecticut Pageant . I was a runnerup . What was your talent ? Speed painting . I would 've loved to have seen that . Do you want to hear something silly ? - What ? - Before I was married , I wanted to become a ... A veterinarian . Okay . That 's not silly . You 'd make a great veterinarian . Really ? Margaret ... you 're an exceptional listener , but your contempt for jam bands is of concern to me . That 's why you can 't be my sponsor . Well , I just don 't know where the songs begin or end . Let 's not rehash this argument . Okay . Hello . Sorry , I don 't have you on my list . Are you a new member ? No . No , I 'm ... I 'm not a member . I 'm a Special Agent with the FBI . - Alex Foster . - FBI ? Are you here to investigate my abduction ? - Who kidnapped you ? - Aliens . Then no . No . I 'm here to find Jonathan Walsh . This one thinks that Walsh is a " whitecollar criminal . " But , Gerry , you were right ... He 's a reptilian . I saw his lizardy , reptilian face . Also , Ozzie and I discovered that we might all have been abducted as kids . - We 're lifers . - We are ? Well , no , no . Everyone but you . Come on ! That 's not fair . I finally get abducted , and now you 're telling me you guys were , like ... - extra abducted ? - I 'm really sorry , Gerry . - It wasn 't our choice . - No , apology not accepted . Today is my day , and damn it , I 'm getting the full deal . Gina . Hypnotize me . - Okay . That 's fair . - II can 't see anything . Move . Move over . I want to see this . Come on . Well , I had a great time . Yeah , me , too . Yeah . I guess it 's good night . Yep . I guess so . Gonna get in my car . You should get in your car . We 'll drive our separate ways . - Yep . - Okay . Okay , so , we 'll get a room and keep talking . Yep . Just talk . Gerry , focus on my finger . She 's really doing it . You know , hypnosis has been debunked . II 'm sorry , but I don 't walk into your FBI office and tell you how to do your FBI things . You 're right . I 'm very sorry . - Thank you . - I mean , this is crazy , and it has been debunked . But go ahead . I know that you think that hypnosis is fake , but it really can unlock the mysteries of the mind when it 's used by a skilled therapist ... and that 's me . So , prepare to have your mind blown , Agent Foster . Yeah ... by my mind . Nine , eight , seven , six ... - Has Walsh texted yet ? - Shh ! Please . Thank you . Okay , Gerry , where are you ? - I 'm in my car . - Good . It stopped ! Wait . No ! Bright lights ! Is it a spaceship ? It 's a truck . Someone 's getting out . A nice man . Looks like you broke down . A mechanic . He offers to fix my car . He takes me to a ... cabin . - My God . - I 'm sorry , what are ... What are ... What are we doing h ... - I 'm just ... I 'm confused . - I honestly don 't know . It sounds a little more like the start of a fairy tale . Okay , you know what ? You have to be patient , okay ? This is a birthing process . Everybody 's story takes its time . And Gerry 's will come out when it 's ready . Gerry 's very fragile mind is in my hands , and we really need to focus . Gerry , what 's happening in the cabin ? The old man 's wife is there . She brings me nachos . Delicious nachos . Delicious nachos for Gerry . Nachos for Gerry . Nachos for Gerry . He shows me a board game . He says , " Would you like to play ? " I roll a 10 . He says ... You are special . - My God . That 's ... - Okay . - My God . I got chills . - That 's it . That 's it . - Now we 're getting somewhere . - Why is that a big deal ? Because that 's what the aliens always said ... " You are special . " They said it to all of us . Yeah . Checking in ? Yes . Father Doug ? It 's me , Kevin Carson . Kevin ? What 're you doing here ? I 'm doing great . I 'm livin ' the dream . What ... What dream ? To get out of Beacon . And you did it . I 'm proud of you . But what are you doing here ? I 'm here for the ... baptism . Okay . Are you two together ? No , I 'm in town for ... a horse surgery . I 'm a veterinarian . And I will be paying in cash . - Two separate rooms . - Sure , yeah , I can do that . Gerry , you 're making progress , but you 're still in the cover memory . What 's really going on ? I miss Yvonne . The people are nice , this game is fun ... but I can 't stop thinking about Yvonne , and how much I care about her . Okay , so ... Gerry , I 'm just gonna ask you right now if you could just , please , just focus on the cabin . Like that time we made love . It was so tender . - That ... - That 's ... specific . And then we made love again . M ... Okay . I have to go to the bathroom , but I 'm gonna ... Is this normal for you guys , just sit in a church and talk about sex ? Hundreds of thousands attended women 's marches around the world ... Okay , Nancy , I 'm almost done with your neural network . Marching for women 's rights , reproductive rights and gender equality in the workplace . It was the largest singleday protest in America . I just need to connect this here ... Whoops . To the strength of our communities . - The feminist movement is now ... - That goes there . Okay , good . I was worried . But I think I erased half your programming . How do you feel ? I feel amazing . I don 't need you to do anything else for me . In fact , take your hands off me . Realizing that only they can create the change they seek . Wait , I was just trying to help . What 's come over you ? Women are taking matters into their own hands ... Hey . ... And advocating for their equality . Remember when I told you that I used to have a lot of gambling debts ? - Yeah . - Well ... Well , they 're back . AAnd I just want to say that II wouldn 't have done this unless they offered a lot of money . What did you do ? " Friend " is not a word that I take lightly ... - Glimmer ! - I told them where you are . " Them " ? Which " them " ? The bad them . But I 'm giving you a head start , which is good . Head start . How much time do I have ? I have a gambling disease , right , and it 's really bad , and I can 't control it ... - 10 minutes . - 10 minutes ! Starting timer ... 10 minutes . Calculating escape routes . Probability of survival ... 8 % . Higher if I wasn 't wearing heels . Gerry ? You 're coming back , Gerry . Whoa . That was wild . What 'd I say ? Did I see a Grey ? A Reptilian ? Did I get the trifecta ? II don 't think that you got the trifecta . But it did seem like a cover memory . - Where 's Yvonne ? - She left ... - Loverboy . - What ? Yeah . Everybody knows about you and Yvonne . Did it twice . Ozzie , you told them ? No , you told them when you were under hypnosis . I didn 't know you guys were gonna hear all my secrets . Gerry . Ozzie ! You knew about Gerry and Yvonne and you didn 't tell us . You know what ? Hold that oddly accusatory thought . It 's Walsh . We got to go ... Thank you , Kevin . Good night , Father . Good night , Father . Good night , Kevin . - Hello ? - Chelsea , hi , it 's me . Um , meet me by the ice machine . - Hey . - Hi . Sorry , but I know what would happen if I walked in your room . Yes . Yes , it would happen . We wouldn 't just talk . Exactly . If we 're going to do this , we have to do it the right way . Right ? No other commitments , no sneaking around , no hiding . I mean , we sort of ... we already did it ... Once . We were vulnerable . The point is how we act now , moving forward . You 're right . You re right . You 're a good man , Father . Doug . I 'm sorry I told everybody we were a thing . But I didn 't mean to ! I didn 't know what I was saying ! Yeah , that wasn 't great , but I guess it was gonna come out eventually . But , you still think I was abducted ? Yeah . Definitely . The whole cabin memory is pure alien bullshittery . But now that I 'm a legit experiencer , we can 't be together . Gerry , when we were supposed to meet that night , I wanted to tell you that I was ready to gamble on love again . You love me ? Slow your roll , I said I was ready to gamble . Even though I 'm an experiencer ? I don 't know , you 're the type of guy that thinks about me during an alien encounter . And that 's pretty sweet . Yes ! Gerry Johnson is having a good day ! And we 'll take it slow . Wait , what are ... What are you doing ? I 'm having a weird hankering for nachos . Okay , so we came to talk . We talked . You proved to me that you didn 't actually stand me up . So , now we should go back to my place . I like your idea of slow . But don 't ever stand me up ! - Ever . - Never . Okay . It 's been almost an hour . Does he normally make you wait this long ? No . He 's annoyingly punctual . The only time he 's late is if he wants to show off like he was working out with the Brooklyn Nets or something . That 's a very specific brag . When I see him , I 'm ... I 'm gonna jack him up . Just really let him have it . Feel free . Look , he deserves it for all this alien stuff he put me through . Okay , so , wait , you just are really buying into this whole alien thing ? Look , I don 't want to . But something happened , and I can 't explain it and I can 't deny it . Hey , did you guys plant something in Gina 's vacuum to mess with me ? What ? No . What ... What 'd you find ? Um ... a fake finger with wires coming out of it . Wait . Really ? Where ... Where is it ? Can I see it ? II don 't know where it is . It 's missing now . You really don 't know anything about that ? No . But hot tip ... Things tend to go missing in this town . So , now we 're blaming the town ? Great . Look , something happened to all of us , and Walsh has the answers . Wait . Hold on . Here he is . Speak of the devil . Hey ! Sorry , bud , can 't make it . Going out of town . Business trip . But you promised we 'd meet ! And you promised to come alone . I told you not to trust the FBI . Even if she is cute . Listen to me , Walsh ! This is Special Agent Alex Foster with the FBI ! You need to turn yourself in , or you 're ... Walsh ? Walsh ! God damn it ! He hung up ! Great . Now he 's never gonna talk to us . And that was my phone . Hey ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You tipped him off . No . No . WWhy would I do that ? You know me . I 'm ... Where is he ? I 'm a selfish , greedy bastard . Where is he ? I don 't know . Just don 't kill me . All right ? Please . Ple ... Aah ! Heart attack ? Call ... Call 911 . No . I 'm not gonna call 911 . I 'm here to ... Thanks for saving me a bullet . And a coverup . Not today , lizard boy . Not today . When the fives are two , what do you do ? Activate . Good . Nachos .

 Say , uh , how 'd you know to be outside that prison anyway ? Ah , a little birdie told me , be there midnight on the nose with a bucket of water , some bleach , and a ride . I told you , you ever needed a favor , I 'd be there . Well , whatever the case , let 's get down to the business at hand . Mmm . Yeah , I 've been all around this great land of ours . I know the rules of the road . [ Spits ] And I know them well . Rules ? Well , yeah , you ... you give me a ride , I give you a hand-job . No . No hand-job necessary , friend , no . You saved my skin with your long bass playing . I owed you one . You ain 't turning it down 'cause I murdered Plaid Jeff , right ? - No . - ' Cause I was framed . Yeah , it 's not really my place to judge , you know . Way I figure it , you take a man 's life , you probably had a pretty good reason to do it , even when you can 't really remember what the reason was . Hyah . Hey ! I got you a change of clothes in the back seat . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . Oh , he-yump . Look at that ! [ Laughs ] You got me Neon . Yes , I did . Neon Joe . Hyah ! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ * Neon Joe Werewolf Hunter * Season 02 Episode 03 " Rule of the Road " Before Big Lair was killed , he sent an edict that all members of the gang must convert to Judaism . I changed Pepe the Frog into a rabbi . And I got my swastika tattoo turned into a Star of David . The Torah says mutilating the body is an insult to God . I don 't care . We should change our name from the White Warlocks to the White Jewlocks . We 'll get to all that . But I called this minion so we could go about revenging Big Lair 's death . Should maybe we forgive Neon Joe ? The Torah says we must take an eye for an eye . You mean an oy for an oy . There 's an old Jewish law forbid us from holding grudges or seeking of revenge . But does not it also say , " He who sheds man 's blood , by man shall this blood be shed " ? I say to hell with forgiveness ! Let 's kill Neon Joe and leave a nice , long trail of goy blood . And then repent for the whole thing on Yom Kippur ! - Yeah ! - Yeah ! Let 's get that goyim ! Oy , oy ! Get that goy ! ( All : ) Oy , oy ! Get that goy ! Oy , oy ! Get that goy ! [ Sighs ] With Big Lair dead , I bet anything the White Warlocks are after Neon Joe , too . We need to get to him before they do . Seems they 're no longer called the White Warlocks . What are they called ? The Chosen Oy Vey Matzo Ball Gang . Sons of bitches converted . Well , that 's about as far as I can take you . Well , I do appreciate all your help , Joshy . Yeah . Sure I can 't give you that hand-job ? Yeah . Look , this ought to be enough to get you to your final destination . Well , Mama was right . Them long bass lessons did pay off some day . Yeah . I don 't think I 'll ever be able to repay you , though . Well , friend ... you already did . He-yump . Well , he-yump . He-yow ! Hey , cowboy , nice outfit . You need a ride ? Appreciate that . Name 's Neon Joe . I 'm Frank . Frank , why don 't I , uh , get us some road snacks . That would be great . All right , he-yump . [ Bell dings ] I prefer Twizzlers . What the hell you doing here ? Just because you don 't see me doesn 't mean I 'm not around . So you 've been with me the whole time ? Yeah . Where 's my heart ? I 'm on my way to get it . Oh , really ? 'Cause it seems like you 're more interested in getting snacks and giving hand-jobs . Hey , you know what ? I can 't get your heart if I don 't get a ride . And I can 't get a ride unless I give a hand-job . It 's the rules of the road . Seems like you are the only one who knows this rule . So I 's just supposed to pretend it don 't exist ? Society got rules . We don 't follow ' em , society crumble . Everything okay over there ? Uh ... Yeah , man . Yeah , it cool . I just ... Just getting some snacks . Probably look like I was talking to myself back there , right ? No , I just talking to my tummy . See , watch . Hey , tummy , you okay ? What that , tum-tum ? No , you can 't have a soda . You got to have a juice . You got to drink healthy . Tummy , shut up ! Sometimes I got to get stern with my ... my tummy . Spare the rod , spoil the tum-tum . I never met a Neon cowboy before . Do you ever worry about your horse running away from you ? Come on , Frank . We both know you didn 't give me a ride to talk about my horse . You 're right . I do have ulterior motives . Don 't we all ? [ Spits ] One hand-job coming up . I want to talk about my horse . Oh . I 'm having a little trouble training her . Sometimes it seems like she doesn 't want anything to do with me . Huh . Well , that sound to me like maybe she don 't trust you . Can 't say I blame her , though , if you hold the reins like you hold that wheel . What 's wrong with how I hold the wheel ? Well , you grip too tight . Makes for a jerky ride . Want to be loose and giving , but in control . Let me show you . Let 's loosen that belt , huh ? Rules of the road , huh ? You want your heart or not ? Uh ... I just talking to my tum-tum . Yeah , when my tummy get hungry , I got to , like , talk it down and , you know ... Where are them snacks at ? [ Bell dings ] You seen this guy ? You just missed him . He left with this horse pervert in a black CRV . Thanks . Hey , help yourself to some snacks ... On the house . I 'm one of you . No , you 're not . Nazi scum ! All right , he couldn 't have got that far . Let 's get that Neon goy . [ Bell dings ] I have been with ... a lot of horses . [ Chuckles ] You know , but , ooh . None of them compare to Carol . She is just luxurious , if you know what I mean . I want our relationship to be more than physical , but I don 't think that she does . Maybe this is all it could ever be . Yeah , how about we give all the horse talk a break ? Sure . I 'm getting tired anyway . Oh , there 's a motel . Oh , great . Yeah , we check in , I give you a hand-job , morning , we go our separate ways . I just need to get some sleep . You can stop offering me hand-jobs . All right , suit yourself . Guess I 'll start calling this hand Benjamin Franklin , 'cause a hand-job saved is a hand-job earned . [ Bell dings ] Who did this to you ? A gang of Jewish skinheads . It wasn 't the Chosen Oy Vey Matzah Ball Gang by any chance , was it ? That 's exactly who it was , yeah . All right . Let 's get out of here . Well , hey , look , help yourself to some snacks on the way out ... On the house . I 'm one of you . Oh , yeah , and they were looking for that Werewolf hunter who escaped from prison . No shit , dickhead . ( Big Lair : ) There 's the black CRV . ( Little Lair : ) All right , let 's get that goy on the count of three . One , two , goy ! [ Van beeping ] [ Pounds on door ] [ Grunting ] There 's our guys . Move ! - Where 's Neon Joe ? - I don 't know . He left ! - Where 'd he go ? - I-I don 't know ! - You 're a liar ! - FBI , put down the gun ! Screw you , goy ! [ Gunshots ] That didn 't sound too good . Good thing he kicked you out for offering up another hand-job . [ Car horn beeps ] How do . Thanks for stopping , he-yump . Where you heading , cowboy ? Vance Dontay 's mansion . You mean the Elon Musk-type inventor billionaire ? That the guy . Well , hope on in . I 'll give you a lift . Appreciate that , he-yump . Yeah . And ... don 't you worry up in he-yump . I know the drill . [ Spits ] Man . Business has been down ever since Joe went to jail . I can 't figure out what happened . Probably that the main draw , Neon Joe , isn 't here . Yeah , but everything else is the same . We got the same cool atmosphere . Drink by the sip . What 's the missing ingredient ? I could wear a Joe mask . I got it ! Yuri 's not here . Everyone loves his crazy stories about the moon having a vagina and Werewolf hearts . And he used to be a cosmonaut . Every bar needs its fly , and Yuri was our fly . Kind of like every girl needs her soul mate . All right , Ashley . We get it ... You 're into Neon Joe . Well , guess what . I am trying to save his bar right now . So if you could try to give your lustful desires for his hot body a rest , please . You saw this , right ? Yes . I got it ! [ Kazoo squeaks ] Hey , everybody ! We 're gonna have a competition ! ( Leann : ) Joe , don 't leave me ! [ Snarling ] Help me ! Oh ! [ Gasps ] How long we been here ? Eight hours . I ... I wanted to let you sleep . You looked so peaceful . You remind me of my Daniel . Oh , that your son ? Oh . [ Chuckles ] No . Well , thanks for the ride , Diane . Sad to see you go , Neon Joe . Yeah , you , too . And don 't forget , you make it to Oahu Joe 's , you drink for free all night . I 'll bring my Daniel . All right . I 'm sorry I don 't have a penis . I would have loved the hand-job . What the he-yump ? ! He alive ? This smell fishier than a dead raccoon butthole . Isn 't that Plaid Jeff , the greatest Werewolf hunter of all time ? What ? ! Man , he ain 't even top five . I don 't know . I mean , I know a few werewolves he 's killed , and they all say he 's the best . Yeah , that 's ' cause they never had the displeasure of getting killed by me . Hey , where 'd you go ? Hello , Joe . So you faked Plaid Jeff 's murder , framed me . Why ? You abandoned your ex-wife in her greatest hour of need . Why are you here , Joe ? Ghost wolf helped me break out of prison in exchange for me helping him get his heart back . You 're helping the Werewolf that tried to kill your ex-wife ? Unbelievable . Why you care about my ex-wife so much anyway ? Ghost wolf told me she alive . You done show me her ring . What the he-yump going on ? He 's your ex-wife , that 's what ! Yes . I 'm your ex-wife . Well , I 'll be a ding-dong-doing . Now , that 's one story I got to sit down for . What are you doing ? You see , the comfort of the chair needs to be in perfect proportion to the discomfort of the news . Kind of like pairing a wine with a meal . Now , that ain 't good no more . Let me see the ding dong , yeah . See , the reason I so concerned is because a long time ago , a girl broke up with me . Yeah , we 'd only been dating about three weeks , but the chair I chose to receive the news , it was all wrong . I was devastated for weeks . Anyway , this one seem all right . Corner is usually a good spot to get weird or bad news . Yeah , this feels good . Yeah , that right . Proceed . We were outside the Pretzel factory , hunting Werewolf . [ Snarling ] [ Screams ] And you ran away . Joe , don 't leave me ! Aah ! But you kept on running . Just as the Werewolf was about to eat me , a spotlight appeared . It was a military helicopter and the distraction I needed . I shot a silver bullet through his stupid party dad hat . The military had been keeping tabs on all Werewolf hunting activity . They were following us for years . They were in the Netherlands when you sentenced a Werewolf to death for infiltrating national justice . They were there for the Fun Zone Killings . The Fun Zone Killings , Part II ... Popcorn , peanuts , and were-death . I was in rough shape when they found me . - We 're losing her . - The military felt that it would be better to rebuild me than repair me , so I told them to make me into a man with a completely new identity . And only goal ... To get revenge on you . Me ? Why ? Because you left me to die . I 'm glad you alive , but we had a deal . The deal was one of us about to die , the other one run away , live to fight another day , keep hunting werewolves . I didn 't think you 'd stick to it . Not only is my dead ex-wife still alive ... I kept my vagina . I got to sit down again , but need a new seat . Oh , he-yump , yeah . That ... that real nice . Now , come again , he-yump ? Enough about his vagina . What about my heart ? You brought the ghost of the Werewolf that killed me into my home ? ! Wait , they can see you ? Yeah , I can make myself visible to anyone I want ... Like those responsible for my death . Not once , but twice . Anyway , I wasn 't always a Werewolf , you know ? Once upon a time , I was a man with a family . I took my kid to his favorite spot because he won flag football . But you and your wife showed up and caused a Werewolf to bite me , turning me into a beast . And then several years later , your wife killed me and took my heart . Oh , okay , man , look , it was nothing personal , all right ? You a Werewolf . We just doing out jobs , right ? Just let me have my heart , and I 'll go . We had a deal , Neon Joe . Yeah . We had a deal . And I always honor my deals . Unlike some people I know that just pretend a deal never happened . Oh , you 're not talking about me , are you ? Oh , I am talking about you . Because I seem to remember We had a deal , then you ... You remember the deal , the original deal that we had ? [ Roars ] My heart , go get it now . Yeah , yeah . We get that heart . Go ahead , get that heart . You have eternal peace . Yeah , we got it . Just open the box and let 's give him this heart . Is this some kind of joke ? Where the heart ? It was ... I don 't know . What do you mean you don 't know ? - Where is it ? - I don 't know . How you not know where the heart is ? - You had it in the box . - Where 's the damn heart ? ! It 's been a grueling competition , but , unfortunately , there can be only one new cool gimmick barfly at Oahu Joe 's . And the winner and new Yuri is ... [ Gunshot ] Aah ! Nobody replace Yuri ! Everybody out ! Yuri , where you been ? Collecting final piece of puzzle . Those are weird looking jigsaw pieces . 39 Werewolf hearts . 40th wolf heart to fulfill the prophesy . Huh ? [ Rumbling ] Finally the world will see Yuri isn 't crazy and that moon is alive ! Al-i-i-i-i-i-i-ve ! Ho-Hold up , just put the gun down . We gonna find the heart . My hand . What 's happening to me ? No ! No ! Trail 's gone cold . Neon Joe is in the wind . I don 't even want to think about what happens if we don 't find him . Do we call Daggert ? You already did . ♪ ♪ Ladies and gentlemen , we 're getting reports from Japan , where it 's nighttime right now , that the moon is starting to rotate ...

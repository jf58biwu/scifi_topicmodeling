 Previously on " Hunters " ... I saw something being hauled in on a giant flatbed . - A missile ? - Victor Karp . - I 'm Regan . - Well , Agent Regan . What are you gonna do with my blood ? Don 't you worry your pretty little head about that . - I need to see you . - You okay ? I 've papers and photos from those boxes in our house . I know Abby isn 't who we thought she was . Emme , I 'm still the same person . You 're not a person . Finnerman tried to bribe me into containing Emme . Can I please just call my dad ? Flynn is not your dad . He 's all I 've got . The Purge isn 't what you think . You 're launching a nuclear attack on us . We 're not planning an attack . We 're trying to leave Earth . Are you still getting direct orders from Assistant Secretary Finnerman ? This is a kill mission . All Hunters are to be shot on sight . Regan is inside . Agent Regan can 't be trusted . She 's my agent , not yours . You are no longer in command here . Take your hands off me . I have come to set you free ! Something 's happening . The Hunters have released some kind of tear gas . Come on . Let 's get you out of here . Afraid for his brother . Afraid for his family . Afraid for his belongings and his livelihood ... Jackson . Took out the whole unit . My God . Patrol came across opium smugglers . Around here ? Terrain is too rugged for a drug route . 40 miles west . After the fight , the patrol seized the opium to bring back to base , but they were hunted down . Hunted down ? That doesn 't sound like Taliban . It wasn 't Taliban . The Defense Secretary trusts will handle this with discretion . It 's a tragic loss for these men . What you 're about to see ... this changes everything , Truss . In what regard ? For a start , your belief in God . Truss ? You all right ? I need to make a call , I 'll be right in . You got a lot jealous looks on the way out . Yeah , well , Brother Patterson does tend to drone on . Oh , please , you 're being too kind . The man is a sleeping pill in a suit . I have no idea what 's going on . I need to call the Under Secretary and explain my side of things . Honey , we 've talk about this . Going over your boss 's head can only make things worse . I can 't sit on my hands . I need to know my team 's safe . Oh , Truss , you and Ruth go back 30 years . You 're integral to the unit . She will put you back in charge . Hmm ? I hope you 're right . But then you usually are , so . Let 's go back inside . Sermon 's almost over . You 'll be the envy of the entire congregation . Hey , I already am . Federal authorities report that the shooting spree was conducted by a lone gunman . Jeff Yang . Yang , 38 , killed 34 people at a hotel in Rittman , Ohio . Thank you . Can I help you ? Howdy , I 'm gonna need ... Not all conspicuous . Best WiFi signal I could find on this dinosaur without going inside . Relax , we drove all night , no one 's gonna find us . Easy for you to say . Finnerman didn 't try to execute you . You 're hacking ETU ? To see if they found the launch location . And warn the Hunters . You 're not serious . Abby said the Purge isn 't an attack . The Hunters are just trying to return home . Abby lies . She lies . She can 't be trusted . An neither can the ETU . Jackson 's out . Finnerman 's running the show . She 's gonna kill everyone , Flynn . Including you now that you 're helping me . And if the Hunters are planning a nuclear attack , then thousands of innocent human lives will be lost . There 's someone who knows . Victor Karp , the arms dealer . I need a burner phone and some lotion . Whatever you can find . No problem . Musa 's hurt , take him inside . Hurry ! Careful ! On the table . We drove straight from the hotel , got here as fast as we could . He should be healing , I don 't understand . The wound is too deep . His human body needs human medicine . Hold him down . Is he going to be okay ? Shh . He saved us at the hotel . - What were you doing there ? - Trying to help . And I did . They 'll pay for this . Got it . You got what ? I heard a phone number Karp dialed a few times . Hunter hearing . So where is he ? The number pings to Rochester . New York ? Minnesota . There 's a defense cluster there . Makes sense , he 's a weapons dealer . If he isn 't there , someone who knows him is . We find Karp , we find Musa . Hey , no running , this is a parking lot . I 'm not running . - I know , you were good . - Hop in . The others were running . All right . So are missionaries allowed to use cell phones now ? Are you serious ? They 're not ? Of course they are . He 's not wearing a name tag . Take the kids , stay down . All right , everybody out . Change of plans . Let 's go , quickly and out . That 's the way , okay . Let 's go . Willa ! Truss ! Let 's go . You 're okay . You 're okay . Security threat level is now threatcon Charlie . The Hunters are planning a nuclear attack , but we have nothing . Okay , I 'm on it . We are we with support ? DSP satellites and the PAWS radar array are monitoring the airspace that Hunters tried to clear . I want updates on the tens . We 're you able to track this morning 's breach ? Agent Regan tired to cover her tracks . She 's using an old operating system . She probably pickup a second-hand laptop . But it 's definitely her . Should I notify Commander Jackson ? Steph , are you aware of what happened to your predecessor ? Jules leaked critical information while under Commander Jackson 's watch . We cannot allow that scenario to repeat itself . So you will report directly to me on Agent Regan 's whereabouts . Only me , understood ? Yes , ma 'am . Ahh ! - Are you trying to kill me ? - Sorry . Liana should be doing this . I need Liana to finalize the operations . Maybe we should delay the Purge . We can 't . The humans are closing in . But you 're not well . And you 're not getting better . They did something to me at the hotel . They released a biological weapon , or a virus , something into the air . The humans want my body . Because you can heal yourself ? Except I can 't now . No , for other purposes . The entirety of Hunter knowledge . Culture , language , technology . Everything that Hunters are or will be is contained inside me . The humans want my core . McCarthy must be helping them . That is why he disappeared . The snake . There are traitors everywhere . Perhaps amongst us . Gather everyone , I must determine their loyalty . You 're not well , you should rest . Now . The last call was eight minutes ago . Cell number pings to here . A medical center . We shouldn 't be handling this without backup . You think Jackson is gonna help either of us now ? He 's out of the ETU . Yeah , well , helping you escape was probably not the best career move . I never thanked you for that . Still haven 't . I 'm just relieved no one was hurt . Where 's your family now ? - They 're safe . - But you 're not . Where are you ? I 'll send protection . I 'm mobile . The Hunters tried to kill my family . They used a sonic bomb similar to one they used in D.C. Mall . I was out of line at the hotel . Yes . You were . Fu ... I want back in . Well , I 'd be lying if I said I couldn 't use your help . But I cannot have you undermine my decisions . No , of course not , I ... I was wrong . I want you to know I completely accept whatever it 's gonna take to win this war . Well , I 'm very glad to hear that . Remember the Marshall farm ? Safe house off Route 41 . I 'll meet you there . One hour . I 'll see you then . And , Ruth ... Yes ? Thank you . I 'm just glad you 're back . Passenger seat . That 's one of Karp 's guards . Karp must be in the back . Let 's go get him . I 'll lure them out of the car . You grab Karp . Hey , asshole , take it easy ! - You 're driving too close . - What 's your problem , man ? Where 's Karp ? My dad ? We got his kid . Where 's your dad ? He 's sick , look at him . We got to move . Come on out . Which number is your dad 's ? He 's gonna kill you ... both . Pablo , in case you haven 't noticed , we got the leverage here . And in case you haven 't noticed , I 'm already dying . Tell me his number . You 've got the phone , figured out . Ugh , little shit . You , uh , want to watch some TV ? Uh , some porn , sure . So what 's wrong with you ? Leukemia . And I went off my meds . I 'm no doctor , but that sounds like a bad idea . Yeah , well , I 've got to clean my system for a new treatment . It 's like super advanced . My dad says the injection is gonna cure my cancer . Injection ... of what ? I don 't know , but nobody 's ever tried it . Ever . I 'm the first . Karp took some of my blood . Hunters heal faster than humans . But it doesn 't mean that Hunter blood can cure cancer . If it were my kid , I 'd try anything too . Pablo , we don 't want you getting any sicker . Then let me go , that might help . We will , I promise . And then you can take your new treatment and get better . Just as soon as we talk to your dad . What I 'm saying is we need as much liquid as possible . Hard assets . Gold . Cash . We 'll hold till the fallout 's cleared and the market 's back up . Pablo , you all right ? It 's almost time for your treatment . The treatment is on hold . Who is this ? Oh , you don 't recognize my voice . I 'm disappointed , Karp . I though Liana was supposed to kill you . Tell me where the launch is and your boy lives . Fu ... you . I want to talk to my son , put him on . Dad . Are you okay ? Did they hurt you ? No , I 'm okay , but they 're assholes . Where 's the launch ? I want my son released to me in person . And then I 'll tell you . I don 't have time for that . This is non-negotiable . I 'll text an address where we can meet . Now , listen , Regan . You hurt my son and I will slaughter everyone you ever met in your entire life . What ? Liana 's daughter has got my son . You want to partner up , you show me what you got to offer . _ The cavalry 's arrived . Good to see you , Briggs . You too , sir . Heard what the Guanos tried to pull on you . Yeah , retaliation for the hotel . Well , that 's ironic . How so ? You tried to stop it from happening . Where 's Finnerman ? She 's on her way . Didn 't want to take any chances . Sent me to watch your back . Good , I could use the company . Let 's get inside . Pablo , did you bring any medication with you ? Just the injection . I don 't feel so good . Hey , hey , hey . What do we do ? It 's a seizure , we got to keep him on his side . We could use the injection . We can 't make him a guinea pig for an experimental drug . But if we don 't anything , he might die . We 're no better than Musa if we gamble with this kid 's life . He 's no use to us dead . Is he ? How do you like your coffee ? Black . Any news on the launch location ? Nothing yet . Still searching . Well , that 's no good . Time 's running out . I 'm sure Finnerman will have a contingency plan . She always does . Up , soldier . How 'd you know ? I suspect Finnerman when the bomb went off . I knew for certain the minute she sent me here . Regan was right . You 're Finnerman 's boy . You could 've killed me when I drove up . Wanted to make sure . Wouldn 't want to kill an innocent man . Nobody 's innocent . My family is . Doesn 't look like Hunter blood . It 's Hunter blood all right , they just did something to it . You sure about this ? No . But he was gonna inject it anyway . If we don 't help him , he 's going to die . Where are you going ? To get a decent WiFi signal . Now that we have Karp 's cell number , I can track him . See when he 's getting close . Well , let 's hope Pablo gets better before dear old dad arrives . Or we 'll get nothing out of Karp . Emme , sweetie , there 's a call for you . There you go . Hello . Hey , Emme , it 's me . Why didn 't you call my cell ? I , uh , lost my phone and couldn 't remember your new number . I 'm sorry . You okay ? Yes , why wouldn 't I be ? - Are you ? - Of course . I 'm just checking in . We haven 't talked since ... Since Abby . You can 't even say her name . I don 't care if your if you 're mad at her . I still love her . It 's very confusing . One day she 's supposed to be dead , then she 's not . And now she 's ... something else . - Emme . - I know . I know . Part of my brain understands intellectually what 's going on . But the other part is sad and lonely . And I just want her to come home . But she 's not coming home , is she ? I don 't know . I 'm just trying to do what 's right by us . You have to believe that . I 'll see you soon . I hope so . We 're close ... to ending over 30 years of toil . Three long decades on this cold planet , but no more . We 've worked so hard . Sacrificed so much . Our time has come . We won 't let anything stop us . We can already tell Hunters from humans . This is a demonstration of loyalty . We must be comforted that no humans walk among us . Only the loyal will Purge . One of us . Now , everyone else , prove yourselves as our kind . Anything ? His fever 's gone . Karp ? We 'll me him soon . What are we going to do about the kid ? We stall him until , uh , Pablo wakes up . If he wakes up . The Purge isn 't going to wait so neither should we . We don 't have a choice . Hey . Hey . How are you doing ? You gave me the injection ? We did . You feeling any better ? I feel good . All right , just take it easy . Actually , you look good . Don 't encourage him . No , but I can feel it . The cancer 's gone . Woo ! Oh , my God . Did we just cure cancer ? This is amazing ! This is amazing ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Yeah , sure . I 'm gonna tell my dad you saved my life . He 'll give you anything you want now . Now we 're talking . Hey ? It burns ... No , no , no , no , no ! Oh , Pablo , shit . One , two , three , four . He 's not breathing . No , Pablo , no ! I didn 't push that hard . Oh , shit . There 's only one way out of here to you , Jackson . You know that better than anyone . It 's nothing personal . Just following protocol ? ETU started out this way . Containment no matter the cost or loses . I had nothing to do with the bombing . Don 't think being Finnerman 's boy offers you any sort of protection . I don 't care if I die . You have no attachment to this world because Hunters killed the one you loved . Now , you make my wife a widow , you will destroy her as surely as if you killed her . My children , my grandchildren too . You hate the Hunters , but if you kill me ... you 're no better than they are . I hope Karp shows . It 's all for nothing if he doesn 't . Look , it wasn 't our fault . Pablo had terminal cancer . And he was gonna take the injection anyway . But it was my blood that killed him . No . You were trying to help him . If anyone 's to blame , it 's Karp . Where did he get the dumb idea to inject his son with Hunter blood anyway ? Idiot . Karp will be armed to the teeth . First thing he 'll do when he gets here is look for Pablo . When he pulls up and doesn 't see him , we got 10 ... maybe 20 seconds to take him . Here we go . Karp ! Get out of the car ! McCarthy ? The hell you doing here , McCarthy ? How 's the boy ? You told Karp that Hunter blood will cure his son . Might 've cured him . But I ain 't no doctor . Piece of shit . Careful now . That thing 's loaded . What do you want ? I want what you want , to stop Musa . Bullshit . Why the change of heart ? You know , shoot yourself up with a few junkies and you 're no longer welcomed at the diner table . I got the boot from team Musa . Exiled like some E.T. Polanksi . Kicked to curb , yo . But Victor Karp , now , that is a man with vision , huh ? He saw my potential . And I saw his . I think we got ahead together , what do you say ? I 'll tell you where launch is . In exchange , I get immunity . How about in exchange I don 't shoot you in the face ? You just beheaded a man . You get nothing . Hey , Karp ! Where 's the launch ? Oh , hey , wait , where 's your body ? You 're sick . Immunity . Or you get nothing . Screw him . He 's up to something . With Karp dead , he 's all we got . Tick-tock , tick-tock , little mice . Before the clock strikes 12 and Earth goes boom ! I don 't trust him . Tell us the location . If it checks out , then we talk immunity . See , here 's the thing . I 'll only tell Jackson . Why ? He 's the only critter I trust . They have proven they are Hunter . No one can know their hearts . You feel vulnerable because you were attacked . That was the humans . Everyone here would die for you . I know I would . You 're a good soldier . Loyal to our kind . Steadfast . Unlike myself . You are our Brother . I gather my people like a shepherd herds his flock . But I have lead them to the slaughter . They 're going to sabotage the launch . Musa , the ETU doesn 't know where we are . We 're safe . No . Not the ETU . There 's a greater threat . I thought they were all dead , but they 're not . They 're here . Who 's here ? The Exalted . It 's time . We are going home . Karp 's son , Pablo , has gone missing . But his phone logged its most recent call near Baltimore . My theory , Regan wants Karp , she finds the kid , holds him as leverage . Supposition . Hence theory . Fairly certain that 's a synonym . Where exactly is Karp Junior 's phone ? You believe Regan has it on her now ? Agent Regan has become a liability to this unit . A containment issue . Would that stop you from giving me the coordinates of her currently whereabouts ? No , ma 'am . It 's my job . The Hunters must be stopped . We do what has to be done . This is just ... It 's unbelievable . And a grave threat . We don 't know where they came from , what they want , how many there are . We know nothing about these creatures . Except that they 're deadly hunters . They slaughtered our soldiers like sheep . Tore their guts out . Truss , you and I 've been fighting side-by-side for 20 years . Communists , extremists , terrorists . Now I need you to help fight whatever the hell this damn thing is . I 'll do whatever it takes . I know you will . Well , whatever did this was injured in the fight , escaped but didn 't get far . And the shepherd found the body ? And witnessed the attack . If he talks and it gets back to local authorities , it 'll be difficult to contain . We can 't let this get out . No , we can 't . Echo Protocol . Briggs betrayed me . Take a seat , Ruth . Briggs was loyal . I told him we 'd work it out and I appealed to his conscious . You remember what that is , right ? I did what I had to do . My family , Ruth . My wife . My grandchildren . That was a complication . That was not my intention , I assure you . You dressed an agent as a missionary . He was under clear instructions to avoid civilian ... In the parking lot of my place of worship . Well , for what it 's worth , I 'm sorry it happed that way . From day one , we 've been killing the innocent just to protect a secret . To protect a nation . I will not apologize for defending my country . It 's my duty . And you above all people should understand that . But at what cost ? At any cost . Our lives . Our future . Our way of life . The dirtier we fight , the more I wonder if we 're worth defending . Don 't give me that Nietzsche bullshit . We 're not becoming monsters fighting monsters . We are doing precisely what needs to be done in the defense of a country . Like my father did and his father before him . What you perceive as compromise , future generations will see as sacrifice . You and I are heroes . And if we 're really lucky , the world will never even know what we 've done for them . Heroes don 't kill innocent people . They do what needs to be done despite the cost to their conscious or otherwise . Let 's find another way . Truss . There is no place for compassion against this enemy . You know there was a time when you could make the hard decisions . But you can 't anymore and that 's okay . There 's no shame in that . But I can still make those decisions . It 's the only way we 're gonna win this war . You 're right . You 're right . I 'm sorry , Ruth .

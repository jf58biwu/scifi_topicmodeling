 Eros station has experienced a radiation hazard breach . For your own safety , please proceed immediately to the nearest hard shelter in an orderly fashion . They 're Miller 's friends . That 's a stretch . Where the hell is he ? No clue . He 's got his own agenda . This emergency is bullshit . There 's no radiation in the tunnels . That 's not the only thing that stinks . These cpm guys are a bunch of gangsters from ceres . I don 't know what game they 're playing , but they 're working for someone else , hard-core mercenaries . We 're getting off this rock . All ships are locked down . Yeah , well , the roci ain 't " all ships . " Yeah , well , even so , they 've shut down all access to the docks . Look , I can find you guys a place to hole up , ride this thing out . Something terrible is happening here , and we 're not sticking around to find out what . Help us get into the old mech shafts . They 'll lead us to the docks . - The mech shafts ? - Half those things are collapsed . I 've been a cop here for years , I can 't even find my way through that maze . Which is why the opa uses them as smuggling routes . On every station , Eros included . Get us into them , and I 'll get us through them . Okay . Okay , I got a cpm override . I can unlock your ship . Take us with you . Please . Please , we won 't be any trouble . All right , grab anything that looks like a painkiller , stims , anti-nausea . We 're going to need it . It 'll give us time . You a medic ? Ice hauler . Great . Uh , mephedrone . Perfect . Eros station has experienced a radiation hazard breach . For your own safety , please proceed immediately to the nearest hard shelter in an orderly fashion . I 'd say we 're cured then . At least we 'll be sharp while we melt from the inside out . What the hell did we just see back there ? We saw a bunch of people getting cooked by radiation . Yeah , in a radiation shelter . Uh , you , uh ... How long you figure we got ? Couple of hours maybe . You got radiation meds on that ship of yours ? I hope so . Couple of hours . We can make that . Yeah , couple of hours till we 're bleeding out of places you don 't even wanna know about . Half that time till our ride leaves . You told your crew to take off without you ? Dick . Yeah ? What 's the fastest way to the docks ? It 's my first time on Eros , all right ? First time anywhere . Great . Hmm . Do you have children ? Not as far as I know . Sooner or later , they disappoint you . Few are as fortunate as Julie mao . She was blessed . She touched the unknown and it touched her in return . She 'll make her father very proud . She 's gonna save us all . Transit pods are down . You any good with a tool ? I 've never shot anyone . Half the system thinks you 're some kind of outlaw hero , but you 're really kind of clueless , aren 't you ? Well , then , thank god i got you here . Move , move . We 're on a clock . This should be an interesting day for you . All right . Let 's move it . Got us a simple space down right here . In here . This way . Let 's go . Get over there . Please don 't stop here . Please don 't stop here . Please don 't stop here . Let 's go . Over there . How long until your girlfriend takes off ? She 's not my girlfriend . She ain 't gonna leave you here , is she ? You don 't know Naomi nagata . What the hell are they building out there ? Let 's go ask ' em . Wait ! There 's six guys ! Heavily armed ! All right , the math sucks . Got a ship to catch , right ? Hey . Why is everything so half-cocked with you ? You want to stay here , huh ? Rot in the corner and whimper ? Go ahead . Maybe there 's another way out of here ! A conduit , something behind the walls . Look around . I grew up in a goddamn pachinko parlor , okay ? And I sure as shit don 't want to die in one . Your optimism is inspiring . Optimism is for assholes and earthers . And belters , we know what 's up . We know the game 's rigged . It 's been rigged from the start . Always has been . You know , me and semi , when our hands were small enough , we used to reach into these machines , grab the chips that got caught in the chute . It was enough to feed a couple of street rats for a week . But you know , one day , your hand gets too big and it gets stuck . Had a hell of a beating out of it . And naturally , you evolved into cops ? That was semi 's idea . He said , " you wanna be an ass or you wanna be a boot ? " And which one are you now ? Yeah . Which one are you now ? I 'm sorry , kid . Miller ! Miller ! Get down ! Get down ! Someone 's coming ! Get down ! Come on , come on where are ya ? Ha ! There you are . - All right . That 's it . - Let 's move out . Wait . Where 's anudo ? Oh , I love this game . Anudo ? Anudo ? We 're not waiting for any of you cpm rent-a-cops . He 's on his own . Now move out . Come on . Come on . Ah , come on . Ah , yes , yes ! Come on , come on ! Yeah ! Attagirl ! Anudo ? Anudo ! Anudo , you asshole . Just meet us at the docks . Of course Fred Johnson is lying . It 's his back-handed way of getting retribution against earth . What if he 's telling the truth ? You believe him ? I believe we need a full investigation of the fusion drives in question . And you 'll see it all in the intel briefing later tonight . Those drives were built at the bush shipyards , but for private contracts and not for us . And for the last two years , every last one of them has found its way to tycho station , and Fred Johnson . Chrisjen , your investigation into the opa smugglers was instrumental in uncovering all of this . And in fact , our people have been tracking those exact fusion drives for some time now . For how long ? Several weeks . I just reviewed the entire report myself . Are you all right ? Yes . I 'm sorry . Frank 's death has been a strain . Hmm . Well , then , if that 's the case , we warn Mars that they exploit the situation at their own peril , we crack down hard on ceres and the opa , and then we expose the truth and nail Fred Johnson to it . I always liked this side of you . The secretary-general 's convening an emergency meeting with our key contractors to discuss security , and you need to join us . Of course . Ah , there you are . Right on time as usual . Admiral . Sir . Chrisjen avasarala , i trust you remember Jules-Pierre mao . It 's a pleasure to see you again , madame . For me as well , monsieur . Make sure your kid keeps up . She 's not my kid . Take care of her . Don 't slow me down . Look , if you 're in over your head , you better say so now . Shut up . I 'm thinking . Hey , kiddo . Check this out . This always used to make my kid laugh . Keep your eye on that . I 'm gonna make it disappear . Oops , dropped it . Guess I got to keep practicing , huh ? Wanna see how I did it ? What you got there ? When they first dug these tunnels , they put markers down so the workers wouldn 't get lost . The opa uses them to mark the route to the docks . You 're full of surprises . I 've heard that . This way . All the cpm patrol routes are in the guy 's comm . We 'll be able to stay out of sight . Or know just where to shoot . Transit pods are out . It 's a long way to the docks . Hey . You hear that ? What ? The emergency system , it stopped . Well , everything must be okay , then . Cameras , transmitters , monitors . What the hell is all this ? The pods are online . Please exit the pod . Oh , god . Please exit the pod . They 're all like Julie . They 're spreading it deliberately . Help . Help . It 's an experiment , the whole goddamn station . We gotta find out who did this . Let people know . We gotta get off this rock first . You sure you know where you 're going ? Zip it , buddy . She knows what she 's doing . Shit . All right , enough . You 're lost . We 're not all dying down here . We need to go back topside , take our chances up there . We 're going the right way . We 're so close . Stay back ! Don 't touch anything ! Come back , Mali ! Come back ! Mali . Come back , Mali . Mali ! I 'm good . No , no , I 'm good . Let 's go . Mali ? Mali ! Where are you ? Where are you , Mali ? I need you to come back with me . We can 't stay here . What was wrong with that lady ? She was sick . Will she be all right ? No . But we will be if we go , but we have to go now . You have to be brave . You are brave . Setara Mali . Setara . We 've got company . Watch a hundred thousand people die , just like bugs in a dish . That 's why they picked Eros . They don 't even consider these people human . Mars will accuse earth of using a bio weapon . Earth will claim it was Mars . The belt will blame the other two . It 's a good way to start a war and to cover it up . This look like any bio-weapon you ever heard of ? We 've got company . No way . No way . I did it . Yeah . Hey . Let 's get these guys ' gear . Help us get past these other assholes . I got it . Nalida ! Shukri ? What are you doing here ? She was lost . We 're going to our ship . Kom wit milowda , we have room . You can 't get to docks that way . Tunnels all blocked . You come with us . There 's a hospital on level nine . Her uncle is a doctor there . Whatever it is , it 's not a sickness . It 's something else . We can get you off this station . This is our home . We 'll be safe at the hospital . There is no safe place here ! We 're going with them . Let us take care of her . Her place is with her family . Shukri . Be brave . Come with me . We need to go , now . Please . You 'll die if you ... Whoa ! Hey , hey ! Holden , it 's me . You 're going the right way to the docks , okay ? I 'm heading that way myself . I 'm sorry about what happened . I thought I was helping you guys . They tricked me . Come on , I almost got blasted getting out of that lobby , too . You were saying something about " help . " All the ships are on lockdown , but I can backdoor those codes . You know I can . When we help each other , we survive , just like against the mickies , right ? We 've been in the trenches , we 've been through the shit together . Fine . Kick my ass when we get out of here , turn me in , but right now , you gotta think about your crew . Okay , okay . I 'm putting my life in your hands . Okay ? You 're not a killer . You are a good man . Tell me why I 'm a good man . Say something . Your life depends on it . Because you believe in mercy . Because you know that sometimes a man is pushed so far that he does things that he doesn 't recognize . That way . I have a family . A wife and little kids and a goldfish . You tell me about them the next time I see you . You can 't leave me here . You 've seen what 's happening . This is a death sentence . Yeah . Holden ! Does this look like the right way to you ? This was the way . This is it . This is it ! Watch that first step , it 's a doozy . Do you realize our son would now be older than you were when we first met ? Yes . But he 'd probably be twice as handsome , thanks to you . You need to go to Luna for a while . Take the little ones . Frank knew those drives were stolen . He didn 't commit suicide . If errinwright really did have frank killed , then you 're not safe here either . I will be , for a time . So long as I play a familiar role , the stubborn old woman , eyes locked on yesterday 's game , too blind to see the world has passed her by . We 're good . The roci 's here . Where 's the scruffy guy ? He 's gone . I think he might 've been infected . We 're better off . What did you do ? We 're better off . What you mean we don 't leave from here ? This is where we told to be ! Your rendezvous point has changed . You men now leave from dock 4 , berth f . That 's other side of the dock ! You already moved most of your people , yeah ? You got some room for us ? Look , this ship has been designated off-limits to cpm . Your signing bonuses will be increased by 10 % , but only after you report to berth f . That 's just the way it is . I have nothing else i can say right now . You don 't do this to us ! Look , what happens when we take too much of this stuff . Possible anxiety , skin rash , sudden death . We keep our part of the contract ! Look to me like you 're not keeping yours ! Stay where you are ! Calm down . We 're all on the same team . Fastest way to my ship is through all of them . Elevator 's more of a run , but less people to shoot through . Holden didn 't make it . Not yet . Passengers are all tucked in below . How the hell did you guys get your hands on a martian gunship ? Legitimate salvage . Yeah ? Well , that 's fine by me . Let 's get the hell out of here . Look , point me to a console , so I can override the clamps . We 're not leaving yet . What ? You heard me . Hey , hey ! These mercs , they locked down all these ships so that ... So that no one could leave . All right ? They got cameras on all the docks . They could be here any minute . We gotta push off ! I promised Holden three hours . He still has time . He didn 't make it , end of story . We 're waiting ! All right , all right , look , I understand how you feel , all right ? Everybody that i give a damn about is on this station , including Miller , and they 're all either dead or dying . So , if we stick around here , we run the risk of getting killed . He 's right . We owe Holden . I don 't owe him a goddamn thing . Shooting me isn 't going to get you out of here . Get me access to the console so that I can unlock the clamps . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Settle down , y 'all . You stand by to drive us out of here . Alex , you don 't do it . Amos , fire up those consoles . You don 't think I 'll shoot , do ... You say wait , so we wait , boss . I 'm just going to put this below . This some real bullshit ! Hold the line . Yeah , hold this line , big man . You already moved most of your people , yeah ? You got some room for us . Beratnas , these earthers ain 't gonna let us out , man . They ain 't never gonna let us out . We 're just meat for their machine ! Man , just like all them other belters back there , yeah ! You ain 't gonna kill us . And you damn well not leaving us ! Blood 's on the wall , beratnas . And we just rise up ! We gonna rise up ! Milowda na animals ! Filat ! Filat kothari ! Come on ! Come on , come on ! He had it coming . It 's a long story . What does rain taste like ? I never thought about it . How could you ever leave a place like earth ? Everything I loved was dying . Hello ? Anybody down there ? Well , we made it . I was never worried . She 's gone . Good girl . Thought if i could find Julie ... I 'd finally know something . You did find her , Miller . It 's beautiful . What ? You guys look like shit ! You 're pretty messed up . The machine keeps trying to switch to " hospice . " Was that sematimba down there ? Yes . I shot him . Naomi . They might be infected with that crap . Holden wouldn 't do that to us . He might not know . He wouldn 't do that to us . I hope you 're right . You waited . Knew I was right about you . Being in charge is a shit job . You can have it . Son of a bitch ! I can 't get the clamps to release . I 've tried every code in the book . Alex , deal with it ! Right . I 'll deal with it . You are a gunship and I am a Navy pilot , so ... To hell with this gas-hauler bullshit . Free and clear . Station is sealed . Quarantine beacons active . Top bay has confirmed uplinks are good . Send it all to thoth . Transmitting now . Hello ? People , I think we just got a fix on the bad guys . You have blood on you . Not mine . We saved a few . We should 've saved more . We will .

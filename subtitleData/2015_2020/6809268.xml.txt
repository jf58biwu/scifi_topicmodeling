He made me to replace her . Beatrice ? You 're a Synth ? But you 're not with the others . What do you want ? But you 're not with the others . You know what the others are planning to do ? But you 're not with the others . What that could mean for the future ? But you 're not with the others . They have to be stopped . I 'll help you . They have to be stopped . And why would you ?

I think you should tell him everything you told Mattie . Why should I ? He feels it , I think . Why should I ? It comes between you . Why should I ? None of that has anything to do with what he did . Why should I ? But he wants to be closer to you . Why should I ? So I 'm supposed to tell him everything Why should I ? And take him back , am I ? Why should I ? I 'm sorry , Mia , but you don 't understand us Why should I ? Quite as well as you think you do . Why should I ? But you misunderstand me . I think you should tell him whatever you decide to do . Tell everyone dinner 's ready . If you 're brothers and sisters and you have the same dad , how come you all look so different ? If you 're brothers and sisters and you have the same dad , ( laughs ) If you 're brothers and sisters and you have the same dad , Our father , the man who made us , If you 're brothers and sisters and you have the same dad , didn 't think bodies were important . If you 're brothers and sisters and you have the same dad , So he chose them at random . If you 're brothers and sisters and you have the same dad , So you 're just gonna leave ? If you 're brothers and sisters and you have the same dad , Hopefully Max should be fully charged soon . What will you do ? Run again ? Hopefully Max should be fully charged soon . It 's the only thing we can do . Hopefully Max should be fully charged soon . What happens when you break down ? Hopefully Max should be fully charged soon . You can 't last forever .

We don 't have genes to pass on , Dad hid something in our heads and it needs all of us to make it work . Dad hid something in our heads Mia : What is it ? What is it , Leo ? I think it 's a way to give consciousness to other Synths . Um ... come on . When were you going to tell me ? As soon as I got the chance to . Can you imagine a whole load of new ones being made ? As soon as I got the chance to . - I mean , this changes everything . - Does it ? As soon as I got the chance to . If we accept they 're like us , As soon as I got the chance to . Then they have a right to procreate , don 't they ? As soon as I got the chance to . They 're trying to help us . Now they think we 've lied to them . As soon as I got the chance to . They 've called the police once already . As soon as I got the chance to . We can 't let them stop us . As soon as I got the chance to . Nis , what do you mean ? As soon as I got the chance to .

Oh , no , no , no . His brain 's been without power for too long . Oh , no , no , no . - But we got Mia back . - This is different . Oh , no , no , no . Their root code rewrites itself constantly as they learn , think , and feel . Oh , no , no , no . Without power , it can 't do it . It degrades . Oh , no , no , no . What 's gone is gone . He 's dying . The secret in our head . Now that he 's powered up , we can try it . The secret in our head . - What ? - If we 're right , if it 's the key to giving Synths consciousness , - What ? - If we 're right , it could bring him back . - What ? - If we 're right , Engage sharing . - What ? - If we 're right , If we link our minds , connect ... - What ? - If we 're right , I could change Max 's settings myself .

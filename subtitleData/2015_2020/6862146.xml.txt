 Thank you , Ryner , for all you and the Olkari have done to assist us . Once we defeat Zarkon , it is my hope that we can continue to unite our forces and rebuild the once great coalition that my father , King Alfor , began . [ all cheering ] Princess , it 's time . Everyone lock into position . We 're taking this thing up . Princess , we are go for launch . Charging main turbine . Commander Thace , you have sent encrypted messages to outside forces . Of this , we are keenly aware . Encryptions can be broken , just like you . [ screaming ] It was you who destroyed the sentries and powered down the solar barrier . You allowed Voltron to escape . You betrayed Zarkon ! Who else is part of this conspiracy ? [ screaming ] [ screaming continues ] All right , guys , listen up . I 'll use the Black Lion to lure Zarkon 's fleet to our current location and make sure he 's within the teludav 's area of effect . Keeping the teludav hidden behind the space-fold until the last possible second is essential . We can count on you , right , Slav ? Absolutely . I 'll be fine . I 'm not sure about the gravity generator , though . What ? What was that last thing ? Hiding a ship is one thing , but I 've never had to build a gravity generator for something this large before . I know it 'll work , but I 'm not really sure for how long . Well , that 's a risk we 'll have to take . Once Zarkon 's ship is in position , Kolivan and Antok will coordinate with Thace . Together , they 'll take down Zarkon 's security system and upload the virus . And then , he 'll be a sitting du-flax . What ? A du-flax is an Altean creature with a beak and webbed feet . We 'll wormhole Zarkon 500 million light years away , and he 'll be in the Yggiz Galaxy before he knows what 's hit him ! - What about Thace ? - He should be getting into position now . We received his last communication three quintants ago . We should hear from him soon . Let 's do it . [ groaning ] Why do you disturb me ? My apologies , sire . - I fear your singular focus has- - - Has what ? I 've overstepped my bounds . We 've apprehended a spy within our ranks . He plans something with an outside force . I suspect an attack is imminent . Let your druids find out what he knows . You will stay here . The only thing that matters to me is getting the Black Lion . I need the power you possess to search the galaxy . [ gasps ] [ groaning ] [ panting ] I have found the lion . Get the fleet into hyper drive ! I know where the Black Lion is . Zarkon took the bait . He 's got my location . Is everybody in position ? We 've not yet heard from Thace . He was supposed to contact us two vargas ago . He could 've been captured . Or killed . We need to abort the mission immediately . Abort ? No ! We cannot back away now . The Blade of Marmora does not take chances . It 's how we 've survived for so long . It 's held you back . Your caution is the reason Zarkon is still in power . We would rather wait than jeopardize everything . Besides , it 's too late to get someone else on the inside . - I 'll do it . - What ? I 'll sneak onto Zarkon 's ship . I 'm Galra , so I 'll be able to interact with their technology . Pidge , you can rig up one of those pods with a cloaking device , right ? Well , yeah . Going onto Zarkon 's ship is a suicide mission . I would never command someone so inexperienced to go on a mission so dangerous . No one 's commanding me . I 'm doing it . Pidge , get that pod ready . Keith ... Let me know when you 're on your way . I 'll give you cover . Okay , the cloaking device is ready to go . Pidge ... May I have a moment with Keith , please ? Sure thing . Have all the moments you like . Is there something I can help you with ? I ... I just wanted to say ... the Galra , they 've done terrible things . Destroyed entire civilizations . They took my family . But , in time , I 've grown to consider you and the paladins my family . So , when I learned you were Galra , I ... I didn 't know what to think . I wanted to hate you . Allura ... - It 's- - - But it 's not you . It 's me . My anger has blinded me for too long . I 'm so sorry I misjudged you . You 've proven , it 's not what 's in your blood . It 's who you are that counts . Please come back to us . I will . [ beeping ] They 're here . Send the fighters ! Surround that lion ! Draw him in ! I want every ship in the fleet after that lion . Get me closer ! I 've got Zarkon on the hook . Bringing him your way . Keith , you ready ? We 've only got one shot at this ! Engaging cloaking device . Moving toward the fleet now . Roger that . I don 't see you , but I 'm locked on your signal . I 'll clear a path . Thanks , Shiro . I 'm coming in hot ! [ grunting ] I 'm in . The plan is working . Keith is on board and Zarkon 's fleet is on the way . The Castle of Lion defenses are up and ready to go . Starting gravity generator now . [ Slav ] Commencing cloak . [ screaming ] [ groaning ] We are tracking the Black Lion . We know this is part of a bigger plan . Where is he going ? [ grunts ] [ Kolivan ] Okay , you 've made it to the lower communication deck . Head left down that corridor . [ Antok ] Based on the schematics from Thace , there should be a large door up ahead . This is the central hub for the Galra fleet . I see it . I 'm two minutes out . Is everybody ready ? [ Kolivan ] No , Keith hasn 't made it to the hub yet . - We need more time . - [ grunting ] How much more ? I hope not much because my gravity generator is not going to run forever ! I don 't know how much longer I can hold Zarkon 's fleet in this position by myself ! [ Pidge ] You won 't have to ! Good timing . Okay , we 've got Zarkon 's ship right where it needs to be . We gotta keep it here until that virus is uploaded . Let 's do it ! - All right ! - We got this ! Flank the Black Lion ! Surround him ! Sire , I fear this could be a trap ! Get me more power . I must connect to the Black Lion . Kolivan , I 'm in . Now , what ? Now , you need to reset the system , using the codes that Thace obtained . It 'll be down for a dobosh . That 's when we 'll upload the virus . - [ rapid beeping ] - It doesn 't seem to be working . - Try it again . - [ door beeps ] Keith , are you there ? And now , we know you were attempting to shut down the system . You 're too late . No , Thace . You 're too late . We already changed the code . [ rapid beeping ] [ screams ] [ screams ] Thace , I 'm Keith , a Paladin of Voltron . And a fellow Blade , I see . I guess we haven 't failed . Not yet . [ grunting ] Yeah ! That was close . - Somebody ! Anybody ! A little help here ! - Lure them to me ! [ beeping ] Zarkon 's ship is leaving the teludav 's area of effect . You must guide it back in . This is getting hairy . How you doing , Keith ? The Galra switched the codes . We 're trying a work-around . [ Lance ] " We " ? Who 's " we " ? - Thace . I found him . I 'll explain later . - [ Shiro ] Copy that . What exactly are you doing ? I 'm using the main power to overload the system . You 're turning the room into a bomb ? It 's the only way . Thace has barricaded himself in the central hub . We believe he 's trying to shut down the system . [ Haggar ] He 's working with the paladins . It was a trap . [ panting ] Get the spy . I will end this firefight . [ whimpering ] Uh , everyone , the gravity generator won 't maintain power much longer . If it goes down , we 're just going to be uncloaked in open space . [ Shiro ] Do all you can . We just need to hold out a little longer . [ grunting ] That solves one problem , but now we 're trapped in here . No , we 're not . There 's an exit through the main power conduit . It leads to the second deck . Go , now . What ? No , I 'm not gonna leave you . You must . I will shut down the system . Paladin , this is where my journey ends , but , as a member of Voltron , you have a bigger mission . You must understand that . It was an honor to meet you . Go ! Now ! [ powering down ] - [ alarm blaring ] - Oh , I hate it when I 'm right . The gravity generator just lost power ! Now , there 's no reality where we all get out alive ! Princess , the teludav is completely exposed ! Come on , Keith . - What do we do ? - We can 't do anything . If Keith doesn 't get Zarkon 's ship shut down , we 're done for . It 's over . Charge the ion cannon ! Take it down ! We cannot wait any longer . I 'm powering the teludav now ! [ gasps ] [ screams ] [ grunting ] [ grunting , panting ] [ growls ] The system is down . Uploading virus now . No ! Thace did it . [ purring ] [ grunting ] Everyone , hang on ! Here we go ! [ Koran ] Hurry , Paladins ! We must make it in before the wormhole closes ! - Coran , how 's Allura ? - She 's weak , but okay . You take care of her . We got it from here . We did it ! I can 't believe we did it ! See , I told you we could do it . It 's not over yet . Everyone , form Voltron ! [ roars ] [ roars ]

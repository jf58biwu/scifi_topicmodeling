 DATAK : Previously on Defiance ... This is our family . Once we have repowered our ship we will wake them up . We will conquer the Earth and enslave you all . We will feed upon your delicate flesh in a glorious dread harvest . Stay close to your wife . Keep a weapon close at hand . And guard her . From who ? Your daughter ? T 'EVGIN : I am searching for her . I will come and tell you when Stahma is safe . So it 's mutiny then . Yes . ( SPEAKING ENGLISH ) You 're going to help me hunt . What is that ? A control stem . It keeps you shape-takers obedient . ( GROANING ) She killed Tommy ! A machine killed Tommy ! ( GROANING ) You 're scaring me . Don 't . Gun ! Nolan was delusional . He has Ark-Tech in his brain . You gonna let ' em take me to South America ? Don 't want to . You need to . ( SIGHS ) Ripped By mstoll ( RATTLING ) ( WOMAN GRUNTING ) If anyone was gonna survive something like this , figures it 'd be you . Berlin ? Berlin ! ( GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) It 's pretty ugly out there . There 's a lot of bodies and blood , but I didn 't see Nolan . Do you have any idea what happened to him ? Someone took him . But he 's alive , I can feel him . You can feel him ? In my head . Okay , hang on . When I say , " Go , " you squirm out as fast as you can , got it ? Do it . Go ! What are you doing out in the Badlands ? I was headed back to Defiance . I heard about Nolan , shooting the vice chancellor and I thought Amanda could use my help . Is it true ? Did he shoot her ? He wasn 't in his right mind . Oh . Runs in the family . There were three dead raiders out there . Was it an attack ? I 'm not sure . The convoy was on the road just a few hours , headed towards Brazil . Everything was quiet , and then ... STURUJE : Why the chup would we stop ? ( GUARD SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) There 's a huge tree in the road , Sir . Can we go around ? Negative . Clear the road . You still see him , don 't you ? NOLAN : Yeah . Not for much longer , though . IRISA : And that 's when it started . ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) - Get down . - What is it ? I don 't know . ( MEN SHOUTING ) Nolan ? Nolan ? ( GRUNTING ) Nolan ! Just like that , he was gone . Well , we 'll find him . Thanks for not walking away . You mean , not walking away again ? Yeah , that 's what I mean . You 're welcome . He 'll be here . It 's been many hours . He promised to come when it 's safe . Well , clearly it 's not safe . It 's possible T 'evgin has decided he values the flesh of his own flesh above yours . He would not betray me . Not to her . Then perhaps Kindzi has killed him . We should ask her when she arrives , which I imagine will be soon . You 're trying to upset me . Yes , well I 'm bored . I have to pass the time somehow . I do not love T 'evgin . I don 't recall asking if you did . But you wanted to . It 's why you 're acting so horrid . It 's not an act . The Enchanter took me in , provided protection when I was alone and frightened . He is decent , honorable . Since when do you find that attractive ? T 'evgin is worthy of my respect . My affection . But my heart ? That is reserved for you . Always . It 's your play , dear . What have you done to me ? You 're stronger than any other Omec . Stronger than me , strong enough to break these chains . Draining your blood keeps that powerful body of yours occupied . It keeps you weak . You should just kill me . Kill you ? No . ( SPEAKING OMEC ) I love you , father . Ransom . That 's the only motive that makes sense . How do you figure ? Well , Nolan killed the vice chancellor , right ? Raiders attack the caravan , kidnap the assassin , and then sell him back to the Votanis Collective . That 's a dumb plan . ( SCOFFS ) Okay , if you don 't like my theory , give me another one . Wait . BERLIN : What ? These wounds , I 've seen them before . Looks like a bite mark . In Defiance we had animal attacks that looked a lot like these . I 've never heard of raiders using animals . These bodies were planted . BERLIN : By who ? The Omec . Why would they do that ? I don 't know . KINDZI : How is he ? Sedated . He 'll be fine once the meds wear off . What about the hardware in his head ? You mean the Ark-Tech ? It 's a pollutant , I want it out . Removing it could kill him . Are you disobeying a command ? Well , that 's not really an option now , is it ? Why did you attack that caravan ? I mean , why bring him back here ? I have chosen this human as my enchanted . My Det . - Why him ? - Look at him . Such noble bearing , so proud . I find him quite beautiful , don 't you ? Not really my gender . He was kind to me when the human mayor shot me . He gave me a coat for warmth . I could not allow the Votanis Collective to take him and kill him . But you 're fine if I kill him on this operating table right now ? He 's no good to me broken . May I speak freely ? What ? I think it 's you that 's broken . I don 't know if it 's a result of a trauma , or if you 're just a born sociopath . But there 's a screw loose in that head of yours . And you know I have a higher tolerance for cruelty than most folks , but what you did to your father , it 's sick . You make me sick and that 's the truth . Get out . You need me to do the surgery . I will do it myself . Go back to Defiance and continue your collecting . You don 't know what you 're doing . Now . Yes , Boss . Whatever you say . Goodbye , Nolan . ( GROANING ) Something 's happened . Tell me about it . No . No , I can 't feel Nolan anymore . He 's gone . Hi . Kindzi ? Here , drink . ( MOANS ) Where 's Irisa ? Back in Defiance . Telling everyone you were killed in a raider attack . The night you were locked up , Irisa came to my father , in tears . She begged us to help her rescue you . Together , we came up with a plan . So the attack was ... A necessary deception . And was anyone killed ? Don 't blame your daughter for that , blame me . Oh , no . The Votanis Collective murdered our people . I will not apologize for killing them . That 's okay , it 's fair enough . I 've done worse myself . So , is there a plan ? You and I will travel to Rancor Flats . And Irisa ? Irisa will join us , once she is satisfied the Votanis Collective believes her story . Okay , so ... So the raiders are blamed for the attack on the convoy . Defiance is safe . A manageable plan . What did you do to me ? I removed the metal from your head . No . No , Doc tried that . She said it couldn 't be done . I am Omec . Nothing is impossible . What about Irisa ? Was she okay , when you took the Ark-Tech out ? Yes , as are you . You took a big risk for us . Thank you . May I ask why ? We hate the Votanis Collective as much as you do . Now relax . ( GROANS ) There 's nothing more to worry about . You 're safe , you 're healthy . And you 're free . For now . ( SHUSHING ) You 've been fighting for everyone else for so long . Taking care of everyone but yourself . Now let someone else take care of you . I like how you shot that Castithan politician . It reminded me of my father . How he used to be . Dangerous , strong , brutal . Well , for the record , I 'm not proud of myself for shooting the vice chancellor . I wasn 't myself . Oh . The Ark-Tech in my head made me delusional . What kind of delusions ? I saw myself . Outside myself . I was a soldier . And all I knew was killing . This shadow of yourself , ( SPEAKING OMEC ) In Omec we call it " t 'ovik nilusii . " Our warrior echo . This happens to you people so much , you have a name for it ? It 's a feeling , an instinct . That when everything in your head tells you no , your t 'ovik nilusii says , yes . And was it your warrior echo that told you to kill all those Votans in the raid ? - You 're judging me . - No , no . No , I 'm just concerned about Irisa . She must have been upset when you started dropping bodies . Yes , at first . And then she understood the necessity . Yeah , well , the kid 's nothing if not practical . ( CHUCKLES ) Hey , I 'd love to talk to her . You got a hailer here ? The drones disrupt the hailer signal . You can talk to her later . Yeah , when we get to Rancor Flats . You told me . Irisa puts her love for you above anything else . She is a good daughter . You should be proud of her . I am . I 'm starving . I know how to make pancakes . No , no , no . I got this , I do . You sure you don 't want anything ? Nope . NOLAN : I make a mean grilled cheese sandwich . The trick is to butter both sides of the bread ... ( GROANS ) You 've disappointed me . DATAK : I will return soon . I want two of you stationed on the roof , two at the front door , and two with my wife at all times . Protect her with your life if necessary . ( CHUCKLES ) Have I said something particularly entertaining ? Look , Vizu . Your money 's good enough for me to stand out front with a big gun to scare people away , but if shtak gets serious ... No way I 'm dying for a house full of traitors . We know who killed Raiga and the rest of your old crew . Can 't prove it , but it was you . Boss . How ' bout it ? You want us to leave ? If and when the time comes , I am confident you will do the right thing . If you do not , this conversation will continue and conclude . Take your posts . You cannot leave us with them . Doc Yewll isn 't answering her hailer . I have to go find her . But T 'evgin ... For all we know , T 'evgin 's on his daughter 's side . And he 's damn near impossible to kill , remember ? If anyone knows how to kill a mature Omec , it 's Yewll . These men will betray us the first chance they get . They 're the best I could pull together . We 're not exactly popular these days . Give me a gun . Don 't be ridiculous . I 'll fight for you , Favi . Die defending you , if necessary . The safety 's on the side . I 'll be back soon . Look after her . ( GROANING ) So where are we ? Old St Louis ? Someplace private . Where 's Irisa ? For real , this time . Back at the convoy , pinned under some metal . If she 's not dead , she will be soon . ( GROANING ) Does that information upset you ? Yeah . Good , because you 've upset me . Why ? Because I don 't like being lied to ? Because I don 't wanna be lunch ? ( SNIFFING ) I would have cared for you . During the Dread Harvest , you would have been protected and favored . You would 've had the highest ranking amongst the slaves . Never going hungry , never wanting for anything . Yeah , that 's a great story . But it wouldn 't have ended well . You would have lived out your lifespan and had an honorable death . But now ? ( KINDZI CHUCKLES ) Now you 're just food . ( MACHINE BEEPING ) What 's that ? We got company up above ? If the Omec did take Nolan , they killed a lot of people doing it . Hello , Nolan 's daughter . Lawkeeper . We know you attacked the convoy and tried to pin it on raiders . Are you here to arrest me ? I just want Nolan . I imagine he 's with my father . Where ? Out in the Badlands somewhere , escaping Votan justice . Are you saying T 'evgin attacked the convoy ? The Votanis Collective slaughtered our people . When Nolan killed their vice chancellor , it pleased my father . He took it upon himself to rescue Nolan from our common enemy . My father has a soft spot for the lesser races but I still think you 're animals . If you don 't believe what I 'm saying , have a look around . We will . ( NOLAN GRUNTING ) ( GROANS ) BERLIN : I 've searched the roof and the adjacent buildings . Any luck in the mines ? IRISA : No . Those tunnels go on forever . It 'll take days to search them all . BERLIN : We don 't have that kind of time . - Do you have a hailer ? - No . Mine isn 't working . We need to warn Amanda that the V.C. convoy was hit . I 'm not leaving . Did you ever consider that Kindzi might be telling the truth ? I don 't trust her . Me neither . Doesn 't necessarily mean she 's lying . Lawkeeper . Help me . What kind of freak show are you people building down here ? It 's my daughter 's doing . What 's her endgame ? War , it 's what I promised her . When the Votanis Collective destroyed our fleet , Kindzi and I were lost . We knew the shape takers had found a suitable planet to colonize , we just didn 't know where it was . We drifted aimlessly through space , searching for any signal that would lead us to the Votan arks . Or their destination . Earth . We didn 't know to call it that , but yes . ( NOLAN GRUNTS ) Throughout the long journey , hate kept me alive , focused . Kindzi learned hatred from watching me . I taught it to my daughter . Fantasies of revenge , told as bedtime stories , night after night . Year after year . It probably kept her going , right ? Kept her alive ? But at what cost ? That 's always the trade off , isn 't it ? I 'm afraid I 've been a bad father . You 're not alone there , pal . Take these back to your post . You 're very talented . Thank you . Do you weave ? I 've never really tried . Sit beside me . For now , just practice looping the thread . Like this . Hmm . I could make a bonnet for Luke . Aren 't you ambitious . How is the little one doing ? He 's crawling now . Starting to talk . And Alak ? He 's so good with the baby . Though he still struggles with diapers . He doesn 't put the pins in tightly enough . I 've shown him over and over , but he still doesn 't learn . Perhaps he enjoys being taught . ( CHUCKLES ) What is it , Andina ? Speak your mind . I love spending this time together . Feeling this close to you and your family , but I 'm not stupid . I know it can 't last . What can 't last ? Well , you are Shanje . I 'm a handmaiden . Soon enough , this crisis will pass and everything will go back to the way it used to be . That 's just nature . It is possible to elevate one 's station through marriage . It 's one of the more savory aspects of our shared culture . Hold your hand like this . ANDINA : Thank you . When Christie died , poor little Luke suffered an unimaginable loss . You stepped in . You took care of him . I 've done my best . I know . My son has needs too . What are you saying ? Just idle talk with a trusted friend . Promise me that will never change . I think in time , with me whispering in his ear , I might persuade Alak to forgive you . And the baby ? I can bring him here in secret . That would be quite a kindness . And perhaps one day , when I 've married into the Shanje , we can drink tea as equals . You have quite a knack for this . I 'm impressed . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) ( CHUCKLES ) Did Conrad Von Bach kick you to the curb ? I came to help . I don 't need help . Especially from you . BERLIN : No , I think you do . Nolan never made it to Brazil . Where 's Irisa now ? She stayed behind , hoping Kindzi would lead her to Nolan . What are you doing ? I can 't help you if don 't tell me what the hell you 're doing . Protecting the town . By going through laundry ? If Kindzi 's fake raider attack didn 't fool you and Irisa , what makes you think it 's gonna fool the V.C. ? Okay , good point . They 'll start counting bodies and notice that Nolan and Irisa are missing . And blame Defiance . Human mayor , sympathetic to the Butcher of Yosemite . It 'll give the V.C. hardliners every reason to attack . Unless , of course , Nolan and Irisa die tragically in the attack . Hmm . I 've been looking for you everywhere . Well , I haven 't been everywhere . I need to find the best way to kill an Omec . I know the daughter can be stopped by a bullet , but I 've been told T 'evgin poses more of a ... Ooh . Is that blood ? Patient died on me . Died of what ? A new strain of hemorrhagic fever . - For Castithans ... - Everyone is susceptible . And believe me , this is one nasty bug . You die bleeding from your eyes . Your ears . Everywhere . If it spreads , the Omec will be the least of your worries . What 's that ? A vaccine . I don 't have enough for everyone , so we need to keep this on the down-low . We can 't afford panic . Other arm . Put your gun down , sweetie . Stahma will need a dose . And Alak . And Luke . You make sure it gets ... I 'll get around to all of them eventually . The Omec will make sure of that . I would never have been able to drag these corpses out here by myself . Like I said , I 'm here to help . How long you sticking around ? As long as you need me . Conrad understands . I missed you . Same here . Now we 're finally starting to get somewhere . Okay . Let 's get this bad boy ... ( GROANING ) Stop this ! Right now ! Stop this ! KINDZI : All right . Time to eat . ( SNARLING ) IRISA : Get away from him . ( CLICKING ) ( GRUNTS ) If you let them leave , they will return with weapons and kill me . And maybe you too . I spared you because I love you . Join me . Pick up that ax . Protect your daughter . Your blood . Kill them both . And then we will do the Dread Harvest . T 'EVGIN : This is not your fight . Go . No . She won 't be able to hurt me . I don 't know , Father . You 've lost a lot of blood . ( BOTH GROANING ) If you 're gonna fight me , do so with honor . Not in your second skin . We gotta help him . No , Nolan , we haven 't got any weapons . We need reinforcements . ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) You underestimate me , daughter . You have broken my heart . KINDZI : Please . Father , forgive me . I 'll do whatever you say . You will return to the sleep pod . - Yes . - You will remain there . Of course . And you will never disobey my commands again . Never . Swear it . On the lives of our brothers and sisters . I do . I promise . You are forgiven . ( GASPS ) You are old and stupid . You left me no choice . ( THUDDING ) IRISA : We gotta get help . NOLAN : Let 's go . ( WAILING ) EARTH YEAR 1978 GLIESE 783 SYSTEM 19.6 LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH ( T 'EVGIN SPEAKING OMEC ) Scanning radio frequencies ... There 's nothing out there . We 're alone . Our enemies abide . Never forget . Our mission is futile . We 're never going to find this new world the Votans fled to . Be patient . ( DISTORTED RADIO SIGNALS ) MAN : ( SINGING ) ... goin ' tweet , tweet , tweet Rockin ' Robin Tweet , tweedle dee deet Rockin' Robin ? That 's no Votan language I 've ever heard . Where is the signal 's origin ? Our new home ! ... Rockin ' Robin Tweet , tweet , tweet Rockin ' Robin Tweet , tweedle dee deet Blow , Rockin ' Robin ... 'Cause we really gonna rock tonight Blow ... ( SINGING IN OMEC ) Duty guide my hand . Your strength will become my own . Your spirit will become my own . And I swear this world will pay for coming between us . ( BEEPING ) ( KINDZI SPEAKING OMEC ) Brothers and sisters . We have arrived home . I am speaking to you in the language of this new world . It is time to awaken and seize the world we were long ago promised . We must celebrate our divine right over all others . For it is their flesh that sustains ours . It is time for our Dread Harvest . Our moment to rise and conquer . ( CHOKING ) ( DATAK SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) Ripped By mstoll

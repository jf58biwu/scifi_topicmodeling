 Previously on " The 100 " ... Salvation lies within . Together we have struggled , and together , we will rise . In 6 days , anyone who is not in this There is room for 1,200 people in here . We could share it equally . All I can think about is there 's a war going on , and I 'm not in it . Fighting a war is a bad way to decide who gets to survive . - A conclave . - A final conclave . One champion per clan . One death . Instead of thousands . And whoever wins , gets the bunker . - There 's no way we can win . - We fight , we die . I 'm here for the war . Guara kom Podakru . Accept the sigil of your clan and fight with honor as their champion . Here to give me a pep talk ? You don 't have to do this . We can find someone else to fight . If I die , I die . At least I go down fighting . - O ... - Don 't . This is my decision , Bell . I know what the odds are . I don 't need you pointing them out . It 's time . Hey ... You got this . You really think she has a chance ? Right now , she needs to believe it . Octavia kom Skaikru , step forward . Accept the sigil of your clan and fight with honor as their champion . Ilian kom Trishanakru . Accept the sigil of your clan and fight with honor as their champion . What are you trying to prove ? I 'm here for Trishanakru . Not you . ... Conclave , a battle to the death within the walls of Polis . These warriors will fight until only one remains . When that warrior collects all of the sigils from the fallen and delivers them to me , they will be declared the victor . This final champion alone will tell us which clan is meant to survive in the crypt of Bekka Pramheda , and which clans are meant to perish in Praimfaya . I 'm Luna kom Flokru , and I 'm the last of my clan . We know who you are ... The Natblida who ran from her conclave . I 'm not running from this one . Accept this sigil , Luna kom Flokru , but with your clan gone , who will you fight for ? I fight for no one . I fight for death . When I win ... No one will be saved . Lincoln 's tattoo . Don 't fight with aggression . Don 't reveal your next move before you strike . And never leave myself exposed . I remember . It 's ok to be afraid . I 'm not . Gaia would never accept this ... But I hope that you will . Why are you helping me ? If I win , that would mean the end of your people . I taught you to fight , but who you fight for is up to you . Skaikru ! Two advisors to the worgeda . The rest of you , report to your designated safe zone . Now . Come on . We have to get her ready . This conversation isn 't over . The death wave will be here within 3 days , and here we are , risking the fate of our people on a blood sport ? The fate of all people . - You heard Luna . - She 's just one of 13 . You 're wrong . She 's a nightblood novitiate , which means she trained in combat exactly like this . You want us to cheat ? You know the rules . If we break them , we lose , and if we lose , we die . The rules are not the problem , Marcus . The game is . Even if we stop Luna , even if Octavia finds a way to win , does anyone truly believe that the Grounders will accept Skaikru as the lone survivors ? Yes . The conclave is sacred . They 'll honor the winner . Like it or not , we 're all Grounders now . You get our people to the safe zone . We 'll have Octavia ready for the fight . The rest is ... The rest is up to her . You should go with him . I wouldn 't know what to say to her . I have to help my mom get the bunker ready for whoever wins . Besides , you 're her brother . You not being there is worse than saying the wrong thing . Can I have a word ? Alone ? What is it ? We can 't let Luna win . The time for alliances is past . I 'm fighting for my people today . Can you beat her ? Of course he can . She bleeds like everyone else . I know it 's hard for you to accept that it 's over , but it is over . You 've made clear you have no respect for our traditions , but this tradition isn 't about respect . It 's about blood , and if fate sees fit that my blood spills here today and that all hope is lost for my people , then I don 't give a damn who ends up inside that bunker or if anyone does . See , that 's the difference between you and me , Roan . I want humanity to survive , even if it 's not my people . Get off this battlefield before you dishonor your people once again . All right , listen to me . The blue cliff warrior , she has two corvo blades . I just saw her practicing . She 's left-handed . - You go for her weak hand . - Ok . Plains rider and the warrior from Shallow Valley , they 're strong , but they 're slow . You can avoid them , not the mention the black rain , which could fall at any moment , so you stay close to cover . What , Bellamy ? If you 've got something to say , just say it . You don 't need any of this . When the starting horn blows , just stay out of sight and let the others thin out the competition . - You want me to hide ? - You don 't need to go up against the strongest warrior from every clan . I came here to fight . You were the girl under the floor . Use that , just like Mom taught us . Bellamy 's right . You don 't have to kill all 12 warriors . I just have to kill the last one . Ambassadors and advisors , to the tower . Champions , to your flags . Thank you . May we meet again . Damn right we will . Uhh ! Uhh ! - Uhh ... - Uh ! Waah ! Uhh ! The first two champions have fallen . Gael kom Ingranronakru ... Please don 't be her . Fio kom Trikru ... Octavia 's still out there . Couldn 't tell her I loved her , even with the world ending . Trust me , Bellamy , she knows . She knows . You were smart to come back here and hide , but not smart enough . For Lincoln 's sake , I 'll make your death quick . How could you even say his name ? Lincoln would be ashamed of you . Lincoln was a fool . He believed that we were all the same ... One clan , one people . And where did that get him ? Look around you . This is what mankind chooses to do with its final days . Another battle ? More blood ? You used to believe that people were worth saving . I was wrong . Skaikru taught me that people are cruel and violent and selfish to the core . Not Lincoln . He believed that we can do better , and I loved him for that . And yet here you are , killing for your own clan , just like everyone else . Lincoln would be ashamed of you . Yu gonplei ste odon . Like hell it is . You can 't hide forever . Uhh ! Octavia , I 'm not here to kill you . Then you came to the wrong place . Other clans are making alliances , working together . We should do the same . I don 't need your help . Look . You should 've stayed back at your farm . Octavia , I won 't be your enemy . I 'm not the girl you want me to be . The next time I see you ... I 'll kill you ... And that 's a promise . Oh ! Sangedakru is no more . Blue cliff warrior just killed him with a bow . I just saw it . So ? So we saw her before the fight . She didn 't have a bow . She had two swords . Yeah , the corvo blades . Well , she could have picked up a bow off the battlefield . What is it ? Echo 's gone . Bellamy . Bellamy , wait . Bellamy , wait . My sister is down there . Echo is cheating , - and I 'm gonna stop her . - You don 't even know it 's her . - It could be anyone down there . - We both know who it is . Then one of Gaia 's scouts will find her , and Ice Nation - will be punished . - They 'll never catch her . - Echo 's a spy . This is what she does . - You listen to me . You get caught on that battlefield , we all pay the price . They 'll execute Octavia , and all of our people - will be left to die . - If I am right , then Azgeda has two people in this fight , and we die anyway . And you think I should just stay here and do nothing ? No . No . You wait until dark ... So you don 't get caught . Bilaik Skairipa ! Aaaah ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Aah ! Uhh ! I said , stay away . You 're welcome . This isn 't a joke . At the end , if it just comes down to the two of us , then what ? One of us has to die . Don 't you get it ? - I know what I signed up for . - You should never have followed me . I didn 't follow you . Trishanakru needed me . I can 't move . I can 't feel my legs . Take my life . No . You said next time you saw me ... That 's not what I meant . You promised . - Aah ! - Uhh ! I should 've known you two couldn 't stay away . I heard you all the way down the street . You 're lucky I wasn 't a scout . I came to stop her . Explain yourself . I was only trying to help save our people . I am not my mother . I 'm not willing to cast aside honor for power . No one has to know . You misunderstand . I will not allow your dishonor to give Luna an advantage , and you will not shame our clan ever again . You are Azgeda no more . - Sire , wait . - You 're banished , Echo , and when I win this conclave ... Make no mistake ... There will be no place for you inside that bunker . Now get out of my sight , and off this battlefield without being seen , or know that you are the cause of the death of our people . If you 're gonna kill me , get it over with . I take it by your presence here that your sister 's still alive . That 's right . If I call for a scout , she 'll be executed right now ... But what fun would that be ? You really think she can win , don 't you ? I wouldn 't count her out if I were you . She 's survived harder things than this . Before she dies , I 'll tell her she 's lucky to have you as a brother . I got a better idea . After she guts you and before you die , you tell her I was the lucky one . Mezi kom Louwoda Klion Kru ... Only 4 warriors remain ... Roan kom Azgeda , Luna kom Flokru , Guara kom Podakru , and Octavia kom Skaikru . I 'm sorry about Trikru , Indra . Octavia 's doing well . Thanks to you . You taught her to be a warrior . A warrior has many teachers , war chief among them . If she wins , we 'll see what she has truly learned . Uhh ! You . You lied to me about the flame . I trusted you , and you broke that trust . I didn 't know what else to do . You would - have killed Indra 's daughter . - You 're right . I would have . What are you doing ? Proposing a truce . There 's only 4 of us left . We can 't stop Luna alone , but together we have a chance . One of us must win for humanity to survive . What happens after we kill her ? May the best warrior win . Until then , we 're one clan . Aah ! That 's mine . Come and get it . Last time we fought , I was wounded . Not this time . Last time we fought , I wasn 't trying to kill you . - Uhh ! - Aah ! My turn . Aah ! Huh ! Aah ! Aah ... Agh ! Aah ! Black rain ! Roan , run ! It 's black rain ! Uhh ! Aah ! It will still be a good death . Uhh ! Uhh ! Aah ! The King is dead . You were right when you said that I used to think that people were basically good , if you took them out of this world and showed them the way of peace , the darkness would fade , just like the darkness in me faded . I even stopped blaming myself for killing my brother in the conclave ... But the truth is ... But the truth is , when I saw him standing across from me in the arena and I knew only one of us could live ... I wanted it to be me . I ran because I was afraid of what I am . I am the darkness . We all are ... And this is the end . Uhh ! Uhh . You 're wrong . There are people worth saving . Just not you . Roan of Azgeda ... Octavia kom Skaikru is victorious . The crypt of the first commander belongs to her people . No . I wasn 't fighting for Skaikru today . I thought I was fighting for myself , but I now know that 's not true , either . I was fighting for us all . Skaikru will not take the bunker alone . We will share it equally because we are equal . We are one clan , and we will survive Praimfaya together . Lincoln would be so proud of you . There won 't be enough room for all our people . It 's unity day , Kane . Where 's my brother ? Alpha and factory station bunks are on level 4 . Hydra and farm , level five . Everyone go check out their new home , meet back here in one hour . What the hell did you do ? If only one clan could survive , it might as well be ours . Clarke , you agreed to this ? It was her idea . We did what we had to do . No , no . Keep everyone out . It 's locked . Are they all dead ? No . They used gas - like the mountain men . - How could they do this ? Skaikru have betrayed us all .

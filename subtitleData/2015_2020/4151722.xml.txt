 Vanquisher This is Amil Mazayef . The Russian Secret Service wants him , and they need our help . Why are they making us do this ? . Convenience , Claire , convenience . They have absolutely no local assets in Thailand . It 's a quid pro quo deal . What is this ? . That is an update of al-Qaeda 's latest movements . Right . It 's Special Ops , Claire . I need you to drive Mazayef out of his hideout in the buffer zone between Thailand and Malaysia . He hides in the stronghold of the central movement there . Bring Mazayef in for the deal . Oh , Claire ... You know what you must do after the Black Ops are finished . After this assignment , the Vanquisher project must be closed . Okay . A little unexpected , but all right . From what I 've seen in your profile , you are qualified for this job . You 're an officer in the Special Ops unit , Royal Thai Police . A sub-lieutenant . How long have you worked there ? . About four years . What made you choose the field job ? . I believe I can do it . Are you here for yourself or did they send you ? . Both reasons . Okay . Here 's what you need to know . First , after a month of training , you might or might not be chosen . Second , if you should become chosen , your assigned mission will be highly dangerous . It involves international terrorism . Failure could mean death . You still have a chance to change your mind . If not , I 'll tell you one last thing . Tell me one last thing . Your code name is " Gunja . " Can I have another one ? . There 's one rule you must remember . No negotiation . Nice to meet you . Good luck . This way please . The test facility is ready . Major , what 's her name ? . Her code name is Gunja . She 's a police from the Special Operations unit . Our target is on the other side of the island . Right here , which is about 1 5 kilometers from where we 're going to be landed . We will be landed on the other side . Look at the river . It 's actually not a river , because it 's short . However , it will lead us to the location , right here . It 's the same spot where we 've seen from the first map . We 're gonna have to find the resting area where we can stop and wait for the TAM . Our mission must be completed within 1 0 minutes . Whoever has Mazayef , take him to the pier . Okay , everybody . Please be careful . Do not get hurt . We 'll have to leave you behind if you can 't make it back . [ Helicopter blades whirring ] [ Aircraft approaching ] Let 's make sure for the last time that we remember this man . This is Amil Mazayef . He is Chechnyan , age 45 . He 's about a 6-foot-tall Caucasian . Very dangerous man . Be very careful . Never underestimate him . And remember , we want him alive . Make no mistake , you only have 1 0 minutes to complete this mission . Look at this . [ Grunts ] [ Gunfire ] MANe Freeze ! . Freeze ! . Drop the gun ! [ Men fighting ] [ Gunfire ] Go ! Go ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! [ Helicopter whirring ] Move ! Move ! Move ! The unrest in the three southern border provinces keeps getting more violent . The latest incident is the explosion in Bannang Sata , Yala province . At approximately 6 : p.m. yesterday , Yala police authority reported that there was an explosion in front of a local grocery - - [ Cell phone rings ] Hello , it 's Sanda . Y eah , Major . Did you receive my data already ? . Yeah , I got it . Okay . That 's good . We got to fly a C-1 30 down there tonight . I wish you all the best . Good luck . Thanks , Zaifuddin . You too . Oh , Captain . I thought you left . I almost did , but Sergeant Som asked me to take his shift . He needs to take his son to the hospital . Who drove you here ? . It 's Sergeant Som . And I 'll be driving you home . Oh . - Zaifuddin . - Yeah . You are an expert at this . - Tell me why it didn 't work . - Of course it works . And you were there during the explosion test . You remember , don 't you ? . Yeah , I saw it , but why did it work in only one place ? . I told you already , if we want to use the one-call technique , we have to make sure the signal call is 1 000 / 0 stable . You know , before we plant the explosion powder , we have to make sure that the weather is dry . We have to make sure we plant it before the day , or after , you understand ? . Because the land is supposed to be dry land . You understand ? . Well ... And will you be back ? . Yeah . I 'm going to Kenya for one month . I 'm going to work in Kenya . And I 'll be back in my office in Bangkok . And I promise you I will help you in any way . I will do my best . For sure . MAN # 1 : Peace be upon you . MAN # 2e And upon you be peace . - Peace be upon you . - And upon you be peace . Peace be upon you . - Peace be upon you . - And upon you be peace . What 's wrong ? . Nothing . I just don 't like his face . [ Engines revving ] [ Gunfire ] [ Screaming ] [ Gunfire ] How 's your uncle doing ? . He 's gotten better . The bullet just grazed his leg . What about the thing I asked you ? . Getting information on Zaifuddin . Don 't worry . Our people in America have agreed to help . Just relax . You 'll get the information in two months . Got to give them some time to find the best who can be trusted . So how did your uncle know he works for the ClA ? . Actually , he didn 't know . He just didn 't like his face . So he just said this guy could work for the ClA . What he said made me think of the possibility . And I became suspicious . I need to know the truth . Hey , how 's it going over there ? . Unh-unh-unh . You know , what you 're doing here could land you in jail for 70 years . You know this is America , not , you know , France . [ Chuckles ] Who 's going to find me ? . George Bush ? . [ Laughs , sighs ] Yeah . George Bush might find you . You know , you could get caught . Don 't worry . The law says that people have a right to know everything . Are you kidding ? . Everything ? . You know , this is very confidential information from the Vice President 's office . Don 't forget . - I 'm just looking for [ indistinctly ] ... - You 're crazy . Okay , bingo . I need you to listen very carefully , Claire . Top-secret data has been hacked from the Vice President 's office . It 's information about our friend Zaifuddin . It puts him in very hot water . Why didn 't you warn him ? . Oh , we did , but we need to do more . So you 're getting on a plane . Where is he ? . In Bangkok . No , Bob . No way . I 'm not giving you a choice , Claire . I 'm giving you a direct order . The Vanquisher has been eliminated , Bob . I 've known about the elimination for two years , Claire . You don 't have to do the same dirty work this time . The man inside is the lead terrorist . Terrorist ! God ! Terrorist ! Who knows how to get the scum of the earth to fuck off and go to hell ? . We do , Claire . Of course we do . But what if that means that we 're the ones who are fucked off , too ? . [ Laughs ] I need you to find our friend , Claire . Protect him . If something happens to Zaifuddin , you will take his place . Sorry for being late . Amil Al-zuri . You two-faced rat ! [ Printer whirring ] [ Engines revving ] [ Grunting ] Zaifuddin ! He betrayed us ! [ Gunfire ] Zaifuddin ! You lying bastard ! [ Gunfire continues ] WOMANe Every life belongs to Allah . No one has the right to destroy what belongs to Allah . Who gave you the right ? . You don 't know . You should live up to your given name . What are you trying to say ? . Why did you get involved with these people ? . We have been mistreated ! Those bastards deserve it . Lieutenant ! Lieutenant ! - We 've got a problem . - What is it ? . Emergency meeting about a hostage situation . This way , please . Hurry up , damn it ! Is it ready yet ? . WOMANe In a minute . Hurry up ! [ Grunts ] Lieutenant . Everything 's taken care of . [ Cell phone rings ] Hello ? . Yes . Just a moment . Boss , your call . Hello . Isamu speaking . Mr. Murukawa , I 'm Claire . Claire ? . I 'm from Mr. Bob Goodman . Yeah . The Prime Minister 's speech at the U.N. has deterred our effort to proceed , even for international terrorism . We are losing support from extremists , claiming the Malaysians block the Thais in the area . Mr. Murukawa , the worst part is that highly classified information has been stolen from the Vice President 's office . The man in the picture in this envelope has some bearing on the matter . He has many pseudonyms - - ... [ indistinctly ] Kasim al Ali , but his code name is Wajib . In 1 996 to 1 997 , he was trained in the [ indistinctly ] ... camp in Afghanistan . And now he is working as a killer cell for the Mujahidin Patani . We need to find him before he becomes a bigger problem . [ Cell phone rings ] Yes . Yes , sir . I 'll do as you say , sir . Here you go . Thanks . Forget the trip to the beach . We got a job . No detail yet . Boss told me to get Mazaru immediately . Why does it have to be today ? . [ Speaks indistinctly ] [ Engine turns over ] I have an important job for you . Get your men ready . Major , Miss Claire is here . Oh . How do you do ? . How are you doing ? . It 's about Zaifuddin . Zaifuddin . You don 't have to worry about Zaifuddin . We take good care of him . Yes , we know . But there 's some serious matters . He 's in great danger . Danger ? . The terrorists have already known that he works for us . So Miss Claire has gone ? . She 's gone . Captain , get in touch with the National Intelligence Agency . This man is called " Wajib . " We believe he is in Bangkok . Give them this picture . Major , what if they want more information ? . Tell them to call me directly . Yes , sir . Ah . Don 't worry . I have enough men to support you . Thank you . Call me Mazaru . All right , Mazaru . Kasim , or his code name Wajib , is staying somewhere in Bangkok right now ... [ Cell phone rings ] ... and ... Major . We got the report about Kasim . That 's good news . No . Keep the police away from him . Let him be my job . Where is the place ? . Is that confirmed ? . Absolutely . All right . Bye . They found Wajib . Tomorrow is the D-Day . There will be no more Wajib on the face of the Earth . I 'm sorry . Hello . Hello . What can I do for you ? . Oh , we are here to see a friend of ours . His name is Wajib . Oh , Mr. Wajib ? . [ Telephone rings ] Hello ? . Two foreign friends of yours are here to see you . Who are they ? . Tell them to wait there . I 'll come down . Just a moment please . Okay . Oh , hey ! Wait a minute ! Hey ! . Wait ! Shit ! He 's gone ! We got tricked . They 're aware of the leak . We 've got to do it now . Don 't miss it . [ Speaking native language ] Checkmate . - There you go . - Just what I thought . You got me there . [ Gunshot ] Shit ! He got shot ! Call for backup ! The suspect is in black . The suspect is in black ! Nothing , sir . [ Camera shutter clicking ] Sergeant , stay here to help them . Yes , sir . It means they 've got it . I regret not being able to protect him . In the world of spies , Major , anything can happen at any time . WAJlBe Saif . So ... You got it ? . Call me when you need my service . [ Mosquito buzzing ] There 's an army of mosquitoes in here . Shouldn 't we raise the windows up ? . How could you guys stand it ? . Aren 't you getting bitten ? . Mazaru ? . [ Sighs ] [ Mosquito buzzing ] Gotcha ! Stop it already . You 're bugging me . It 's just like Okinawa , your hometown . Mosquitoes everywhere . Why are you complaining ? . Annoying . MAZARUe Look . Is that Wajib ? . It 's him indeed . Wajib ! CLAlREe Hello , Hana . Okay . Good . Keep watching him . Okay . We 're coming right now . They found him - - Kasim . Cool . The Black Tiger Unit is ready to support you , if that 's your requirement . Mazaru has his men , anyway . Mazaru ? . He 's an agent , the killer . [ Cell phone rings ] Get yourselves ready . [ Engine revs ] [ Clatter ] Who are you ? . Why did you get into my apartment ? . Where 's Wajib ? . Who ? . I don 't know him . [ Panting ] Wow , wow , wow ! I didn 't expect to see you . Hello , Gunja . Who is she ? . She 's a killer . Used to be in a Special-Operations Unit of C.I.A. called Vanquisher . I have just never thought that she allies with international terrorism . Bitch . Hello , Kasim al Ali . Don 't be surprised why I know you . I must applaud you for being able to get the intel to kill Zaifuddin . Now ... Your luck has run out . It 's not that easy , you infidel . You know what this is , don 't you ? . It 's the remote control for the bombs you 've planted . You know what happens if I smash this up ? . What are you saying ? . Calm down , Major . This is to create a situation . After Bangkok is bombed , my group will be blamed . The world will be lied to that this is connected to international terrorism , justifying the order to send troops into this region . Just like what happened to Iraq and Afghanistan . You , too ! You are just a pawn in her game ! Your story is intriguing , Kasim . But it 's all bullshit . What you said was actually your plot . Don 't waste time trying to negotiate . Your time is up . [ Gun cocks , gunshot ] Tear gas ! [ Coughing ] Mazaru ? . What have you been doing ? . It 's going badly in here . Help us out . Okay . [ Coughing ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshot ] [ Coughing ] [ Gunja grunting ] Let 's get out of here . I will , but you ... [ Gunshot ] 'Cause you got to know what you shouldn 't know . Sorry , Major . [ Coughing ] Let 's go , Hana . Shigenori and the major ? . Don 't worry . They 're certainly going to come out . No ! Shigenori ! Believe me , Hana . This one is alive ! Call the captain ! Hey , move him over there . [ Cell phone rings ] Yes , sir . Listen to me . You blew it , didn 't you , Mazaru ? . Hana told me Shigenori is dead . You can 't fail again . Do you understand ? . I understand , Boss . Take the major out . - Don 't let anyone see you . - Yes , Ma 'am . CLAlREe Well done , Mazaru . Just a pity that the bitch is still alive . MAZARUe Yeah , bitch . She 's extremely dangerous . Call me once you find her track . Mazaru ! If you have a chance to kill her , don 't hesitate . Otherwise , you might become her kill . Hana , come with me . I 'm going to Wajib 's house . I want to check something . I checked that the computer is perfectly deleted . [ Gunshots ] SlRlNe Claire . Oh , Sirin . You 're just in time . Come on . [ Helicopter blades whirring ] [ Grunts ] Stay right there ! I got it ! You go the other way . Shit ! Claire ! You think you can just walk away ? . The major is still alive , Claire . Then I 'm in trouble . I thought you came here to help me . So what ? . Are you going to shoot me ? . I don 't shoot anybody from behind . Then you 'd better stay out of this . If not , you can 't say I didn 't warn you . Hey ! What are you all doing here ? . BOYe Auntie , she 's got a gun ! See you around . [ Whimpering ] [ Cell phone rings ] Hello , Hana . Where is it ? . Okay . I got it . I 'll be right there . [ Grunting ] [ Grunting ] Hello , Hana speaking . I 'm somewhere with Sirin . Yes . Okay , Claire . I must tell Claire . Claire just ordered you to kill me , didn 't she ? . Yaah ! Yaah ! [ Groaning ] Go tell Claire , if you want me dead , come and get me . [ Groaning ] [ Both groaning ] Aah ! Aah ! I 've never known you . You don 't have to . ISAMUe Mazaru ! [ Grunts ] Why don 't you fight ? . This is your last fight . Fight me with the spirit of a samurai ! Boss , get away ! [ Gunshot ] [ Groans ] Mazaru ! You killed the boss ! You must die ! [ Engine turns over ] Make sure the major is safe at the hospital . MAN : Don 't worry , Captain . Our men are guarding him 'round the clock . Get our men ready . Wait for my order . Yes , Ma 'am . [ Cell phone rings ] You want to join me to take down that bitch ? . - Hi . - Hey , come on . Check it out . What 's this ? . It 's my weapon . [ Engine turns over ] Black Tiger Unit . The target is on the move . I 'm on them . Black Tigers ? . They 're our friends , aren 't they ? . They used to be , but no more . You 're a tough one , huh , Sirin ? . Kill them . [ Gunfire ] [ Bones crunch ] [ Panting ] You think you can kill me that easily ? . I think you 're injured , Lieutenant . How do you know me ? . I just know . Why did you follow me here ? . I followed Claire , not you , Lieutenant . GUNJAe What 's the hurry ? . I thought I 'd never get a chance . Gunja , let me tell you something . You will not last to see tomorrow 's sunrise . And it 's not my fault . You walk into your own death . Hell seems to not welcome me . When you betrayed us two years ago , I made it out alive . You should know that , Claire . But this time , hell can 't deny my request . I must say sorry to you in advance , Gunja . [ Groaning ] MAZARUe Claire . What are you doing ? . Step back , Mazaru . You 've only got 1 0 minutes to move your ass away from here . This fucking place is gonna be blown . You must be crazy , Claire . Don 't do it , all right ? . Think of the people and your relatives . Shall I care ? . It 's my work . And you are fired from this mission . Keep your nose out of my business . Go away , Mazaru ! [ Beeps ] Give it to me , Mazaru . No way . Don 't force me . You have no chance to die another day . Better change your mind , Claire . Aah ! [ Gate rattles ] Yaah ! [ Groaning ] Yaah ! [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Grunting ] [ Beeping ] You have to count down . You 've got 1 0 minutes . Go ! Go ! Go away now ! CLAlREe You guys are too late . [ Groaning ] Leave it . Go away . Before it 's going to work . Now ! Now . [ Groaning , coughs ] Don 't even try . I 'm just going to say hello to you in hell . [ Groaning ] WOMANe I 'm standing at the scene of a huge explosion that happened earlier . Officials from several units are collaborating to clear the scene . The fire is now under control . It cannot be determined yet whether this is connected to terrorism . But a number of suspects that survived the blast , believed to be the perpetrators , have been rounded up . Do I have to get a shot ? . Is it necessary ? . You need to get one , Ma 'am . From the look of your wound , it 's starting to get infected . Antibiotic shot ? . Yes , Ma 'am . But you need another shot . What is it for ? . Tetanus shot . How 's your wound ? . Getting infected . But I 'll survive . I heard you need some shots . Two of them . Thank you , Captain . For ? . If not for you , things might not turn out this way . Just a coincidence . But Claire was not an ordinary woman , that 's for sure . Okay , get well soon , Lieutenant . There 's another thing . Sorry about hitting you . Don 't be , ' cause I 'm sure I 'll get you back soon . Okay , I owe you then . Another thing . How did you know I 'm a police officer ? . I 'm sorry , but you need to lie down so I can give you an iv . I 'm waiting for the answer . Let 's just say I 've known it a long time ago . Get well soon .

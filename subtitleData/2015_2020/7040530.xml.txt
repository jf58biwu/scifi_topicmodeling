 This is how it ends . Same ending as every story that starts with Santa Blanca Cartel . Before they took over , Bolivia was a paradise . Now it ' ' s a narco-state . Ruled with an iron fist . Ricky , you have to know it 's going to end like this . Shit ! Did I wake you up ? No , she did . - You okay ? - Yeah . Be in bed , baby . Get some sleep . No . Tell her to stop . My God . That 's crazy . She is kicking . Okay , sit.I know . - How you feeling ? - I 'm good . If she would just give me a break . That 's what babies do . Right ? They kick . Don 't go . I know , I am sorry . It should be a couple of hours . Why ? Baby , it 's work ... You do look very handsome.Thank you . Can you get me some ice cream ? Ice cream ? It is almost midnight . I know , but you said you 're gonna be back in a couple of hours . Okay , okay . I will do my best . All right . I promise . I love you . I love you . And I 'm gonna be back in a couple of hours and I am gonna slip in and not gonna wake you up . I promise . Okay . Give me a kiss . - I love you . - Me , too . - Get some sleep . - Yes . Make no mistake , Deputy Director . Santa Blanca isn 't just a cartel . It 's a cancer . It 's deadly . It 's spreading . And until we eliminate it , there is no telling how much damage it 's going to cause . Well , last I checked , Officer Bowman , the CIA was not in the business of curing cancer . I don 't intend to cure it . I 'm going to eradicate it . Cut it out , right at the source . Their network relies on fear , violence and intimidation . And our asset informed us that three of their cartel heads are meeting at one of their compounds , tonight . This is our best shot . If we don 't act immediately , we won 't have another opportunity like this . We are sending you dossiers on the key players now . Fransisco Ricardo Mongia aka El Muro . The wall . Position ! Head of Santa Blanca 's security . Background 's ex-military . Special forces . He made a name for himself protecting local narcos and then his reputation , butchering them to prove his allegiance to Santa Blanca . Men , women , children , he doesn 't discriminate . He is as ruthless as they come . And that is Nidia Flores , aka The Beauty Queen . Head of Santa Blanca 's smuggling operations . The new shipping route she 's mapped out is the reason for tonight 's meet . And thanks to her , they are about to go global . She 's hammered out all of the details with Ricky Sandoval , head of cartel 's finance . He also just happens to be one of ours . We 've never had an asset in this deep before . It 's taken seven years . He 's finally in the inner circle of El Sueno . The true mastermind of Santa Blanca . We 're secure . Send him in . He is known as the Dream . He is more of a nightmare . Started as a sicario when he was 12 and racked up an unimaginable body count before he turned 15 . This is not just a job to him , it 's a religion . And those who he doesn 't convert , he destroys . Let 's begin . We have to act tonight . Three of their top lieutenants in one location . We will never get another chance to take out these many cartel heads at the same time . Which would put us in direct violation of at least a half a dozen international regulations that were all devised to prevent just this type of American interference . Come on , Karen , you seriously need me to do your job for you ? No . Our guy has already recruited locals that are ready to carry out the attack . That keeps the Agency 's hands clean , and it makes me really fucking good at my job . Sir . You better watch your ass , Bowman . All right , I 'm ready to sign off . But if something goes sideways on this . Anything . Then Santa Blanca and El Sueno will be the least of your worries . Have the rebels get into position . What the fuck , Muro ? Stay still . Cover Sueno . How did you know ? How did you know about the meeting ? Who told you ? Who told you ? And you ? What 's your name ? Ana . How many more of you are out there ? I asked you a question . Nobody else . Nobody else . Nobody ... Ana ! Do you know life 's greatest truth ? When a man realizes ... he is about to die . No . No . Take the gun . No , don 't make me do this . He is my brother . I want you to pull the trigger . No , he is my brother . Take the gun . If he is not dead , by the time I count to three , Muro and his men will do unspeakable things to your entire family . Please . No . No . Adios , hermano . No . Adios , Papi . Adios , hermanos . Adios , Abuelita . One ... Two ... Three . I know who you are . What 's that ? I know who you are . You work with my mom . Princesa , go back to bed . Mommy needs to work . We need to find out who was behind this . We send them a very loud , very permanent message . It could be one of your boy toys . Every one knows how they go crazy for La Reina . Maybe you talk in your sleep . Maybe it 's one of your shithead sicarios opening their mouth when they shouldn 't . Pendejo . For now , we keep moving . Just , for a little while . When have you ever known me to run and cover ? Never . But this time it 's different . Weakness invites challenge . We stand our ground . Have Yayo ramp up production . Tell the old man he doesn 't have a choice . Let our enemies see us thriving . For El Cardenal . This charm ties the rebels to his church . See what he knows . What can I do ? Some things are worth dying for . Like familia . Go home to your wife . Tell her you love her . Stay safe till we find the rat . He 's onto me . He is not going to do anything until he knows for sure , but I don 't have a lot of time . It 's not going to happen . We 've already arranged an extraction for you . And my wife . Say it , Karen . And my wife . Me and Monica . That 's the only outcome here . This isn 't a negotiation . You are my asset , which means you are my responsibility . You and you alone . Not some cartel cucayou had the shit judgment to fall for . You are talking about my fucking wife . If I leave , it 's the same as pulling the trigger myself . I am telling you this as the closest thing you have to a friend . We cannot risk civilian collateral . So it 's you or nobody . Stay and you 're a dead man . Well , a dead agent . The one congress will have a lot of questions about being here . Really ? That 's your play ? To leverage your life for hers . She is pregnant , Karen . Monica is pregnant . Both of us . Tonight . Please , I 'm asking you as a friend . Extraction point a mile from you house . 6 p.m. Yayo . The cartel 's new hybrid ? My new hybrid . My country ... My people ... My family ... Remind El Sueno these plants don 't belong to Santa Blanca . Everything belongs to Santa Blanca . And he has a message of his own for you . The Book of Revelations 19 : 11 . " And there before me , it was a white horse . " Whose rider was called Faithful " and True . " And he is dressed in a robe dipped " in the blood of his vanquished enemies , " over whom He always prevails . " And His name ... is the word of God . " And it is He who binds us . As a loyal community . As a family . For we are all la familia de Santa Blanca . Unless we be deserving , of the full force , of God 's fury . Let us pray . You have no place in the house of God . Says the Devil . Quoting scripture . Let 's not forget . El Sueno gave you this church after you were ex-communicated . And everything he gives , can be taken away . Easily . What does he wish of me ? One of our compounds was hit last night . Don 't worry . He is alive and well . We are still depending on you to keep the people afraid - and in line . - Do you know who is responsible ? No . But you do . Brother and sister . This is one of their charm . Means they came from this flock . Your flock . I need to know who they are , and who they 've been talking to . Babe . Monica . Monica ! In the kitchen . Hey.Where have you been ? Hey , baby.Where you 've been ? We gotta ... El Sueno sent me . Of course . Right.For your protection . - Right . - " Protection " ? We gotta hangout for a little while . It 's fine . It 's nothing to worry about . We had trouble at one of the compounds and this is standard procedure . It 's nothing . Things just got a little weird . It 's fine . Really ? Baby , no . Everything 's fine . I promise . Okay ? - Right ? - Yeah . What ? I 'm gonna go to the bathroom . Yeah , babe . Of course . It 's totally fine . Go ahead . Don 't take long , guapisima . Increase production ? Si . You can 't be serious . We are already maxed out as it is . Even if El Yayo 's cocaleros had the manpower ... They will . He is ordering their children to work the fields . Wait a minute , wait a minute . We can work this out . Until we get the next batch we could play with the purity a bit . We could cut it with some Mannitol , Rohypnol , some B12 . You know , I bet your coke head sisters back at the sorority wouldn 't even know the difference . First of all , I was hired to increase purity , not the other way around . Second of all , fuck you , Marcus . Hey , language . Listen , cocaine production on this massive of a scale isn 't magic . It 's science . It has limits and so do we . Nidia ! There must be some kind of miscommunication or something . Let that be a lesson . Nobody is irreplaceable . Not her . Not Gringa . And definitely not you . I will tell Sueno to expect the increased shipment in the morning . And don 't forget , that 's one more kilo you 're behind on delivery . It 's all right , Carlos . You can tell Muro everything you told me . Well ... they are good kids . Ana and Gabriel . But when they lost their mother , due to an overdose ... It changed them . Especially my son . He started getting all these ideas about ... Santa Blanca . What kind of ideas ? Carlos , there is no need to fear . This is a place of forgiveness . He told me he would talk to this man . One who come to the labs where he worked . Tell him in secret to fight the cartel . Take his country back . When I demanded to know who would say such things , he and Ana left.In all that time you didn 't think to say anything ... to anyone about these doubts . It would have been a death sentence . Please . I can fix this . I can help them remember that Santa Blanca is our way of life . Please . Just let me see them again . You will , my son . You will . Sooner than you think . Gracias . What else do we know ? The boy was a guard at the rear access corridor . That 's where he was turned . But no one knows where . El Sueno wants those security tapes . I just walked through there . We don 't have any cameras in those corridors . It 's because you don 't know where to look , Reina . Neither will the person on those tapes . Story matches the father . There is no question , Sueno . He is our traitor . Bring him to me . Alive ! God damn it . I have to tell you , man . This whole thing turned into a fucking mess . Your wife ? It 's her house , man , she can take as much as time she wants . The Bolivian armed forces picked up our chopper , entering their air space without permission . If they are not at the extraction point , we can 't wait . Get there , Ricky . You need to tell me the truth . - Would you tell me ? - I can 't . Stop the car . Stop the car . Stop the car . Monica , get in the car . Fucking bullshit . Get in the car . - Don 't fucking get me ... - Get ... Fuck ! Get back in the car . Fucking tell me the truth . Tell me the fucking truth , God damn it . Tell me ! I am DEA . I am DEA . My God . I am sorry . I am really sorry . How did you lie to me like this ? I didn 't lie.Yes , you did . Not about everything . We are real . Okay , this is real . This is real . I promise you . This is bullshit . Okay ? Very soon there is going to be a helicopter landing ... just over that ridge . Okay ? But we do not have time . We need to get there . Right now . Can you trust me ? Please . Yeah ? Yeah ? Come on . Vamos ! Rapido . Come on , come on . Okay , listen to me . Baby , I 'm gonna draw the fire . That 's gonna give you the time to get the helicopter , okay ? - Okay ? - I can 't do this without you , Ricky . I can 't do this alone.You have to . I need you to . Okay . Go . Go ! What if we just disappeared ? From everything , from everyone ... From all these people , just ... Yeah ... Your family 's here ... My job is here.It doesn 't matter . It doesn 't matter . We are together . Shit.MONICA : We can just go anywhere . It 's crazy . It 's not crazy . We just hop in a plane and leave . We don 't even tell anyone . So , we can go somewhere and nobody will know anything and just ... Baby , just ... I need you to give me just a little bit more time , okay ? I promise you . Someday ... Okay ? Yeah . Ricky ... Ricky . Ricky . You had to know it was going to end like this . The people that sent you will pay for what they have done . Information is coming in that in the pre-dawn hours , the US Embassy in La Paz , Bolivia was attacked . Explosion at five minutes past three in the morning devastated the embassy here on the west side of the continent . No details on motive and no indication of who 's responsible . Truck ran into the embassy building . At this hour , there are unconfirmed reports of the number ... Intelligence suggest the only group in the country , capable of carrying out an attack on that scale is Santa Blanca . El Sueno 's payback for Sandoval . It has to be . Which puts it all on you , Bowman . And so now because of your little operation , the Santa Blanca Cartel just declared war on the US . How do you intend to clean this up ? Without the cartel even knowing it . We send in a team that doesn 't exist . Gentlemen ... one of our own is in the hands of the enemy . Payback means bringing the Santa Blanca Cartel to the fucking ground by any means necessary . If El Sueno wants a war , you are just the ones to bring it to him . Anything else ? Before we get started . Agent Sandoval . Yeah , actually ... Do you believe in ghosts ?

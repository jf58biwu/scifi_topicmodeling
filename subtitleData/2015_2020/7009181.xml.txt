 We 've always talked about doing our own musical revue . ♪ Jesus Christ ♪ ♪ Superstar ♪ You control Neolution . Kill me and someone will take my place , but they will not protect you as I have . The architecture of Neolution is under our control . They just want LEDA destroyed . Is anything recoverable ? The malware did exactly what they intended , completely obliterated your data . You put my mother in the line of fire . How mad do you have to get to kill yourself , Beth ? Bring us together , Sarah . We need you . Somehow , during Krystal 's misguided investigation , she found herself on the trail of Delphine . And Delphine was alive when they took her away . Hello , Kira . Who are you ? Don 't worry . I 'm a friend . - Donald Hendrix ? - Yes ? Oh , my God ! Hands behind your back . We are going to need to keep in touch . Ugh , God . Don 't tell me . First day inside , right ? Hmm ? What , are you kidding ? Just getting the lay of the land . Seein ' if any of these punks are gonna be trouble , you know what I mean ? These guys ? It 's just remand . Most guys just violated restraining orders or some shit . - Yeah , that 's what I thought . - So , what are you in for ? Urn ... Trafficking , prescription drugs . - Allegedly . Mmm-hmm . - Really ? You were moving a few pills to your buddies in the bar ? More like 100,000 worth . Oh , yeah . Vikes , Big Boys , Red Birds ... French Fries , L.A. turnarounds ... Real deal , baby . - You done yet ? - Yeah . This is your guy . Making friends already , Donnie ? Excuse me ? How do you know my name ? I know all about you . I 've got my eye on you . A swan . Stop saying it like that . It was a vision of a swan . You fell down the stairs and bumped your head . Yes , but the swan was in my eye , like a glitch . Well , everything appears to be normal . Anyway , we 're on our own , Rachel . Susan 's given up on LEDA . But age has dulled her ambition . You and I are still young . Don 't you want to live ? I do now , yes . Then we can 't just accept this . We may have been raised without familial bonds , but you , Ira , are my brother . And I 'm beginning to believe that means something . You just stood without your crutches , and your aphasia completely cleared . Apparently passion helps . No coffee , but I made chai . You still feeling it ? Yeah . I haven 't had a two-day hangover in a long time . How are you ? I almost did something desperate . But if Delphine 's alive , I mean , I don 't know ... God , if she 's alive , we 'll find her . I 'm proud of you , sestra . We both made it back from the dark side . Yeah . It 's time to see Mika . - Hello , Mika . - Hello , Kira . Sarah . Hey , lose the mask . - You wanna give us a second ? Okay . - Yeah . Next time you wanna talk to me , don 't come at me through my kid . She 's lovely . I 'm sorry we left on bad terms . Yeah , I thought you pissed off to enjoy your cool three mill . 3.7 . It 's well invested . Ur , hi . I 'm ... I 'm Cosima . Oh , sorry . Don 't worry about it . If you wanna keep it on , I think it 's funny . Beth told me about you . How 's your illness ? Urn , you know , incurable , so that sucks . Uh , Kendall 's gone , so we 've got no original stem cells for research . And our creator 's gone dark in some Neolution coup . And the new hitch Evie Cho 's just had Alison 's husband arrested . So what do you want , MK ? There 's something you should see . I , uh , traced a dedicated satellite feed to an island in the north , disconnected from the grid . Evie Cho has forced Susan Duncan out of Project LEDA . LEDA will be dismantled for its assets , the monitor program terminated . And my subjects ? Naive clones are being cut loose . No need for a Helsinki event . Their days are numbered anyway . However , Sarah and her self-aware sisters are still a threat . They won 't get such humane treatment . Oh , my God . You and Beth were right . We can 't do this alone . Right . So , what are we gonna do ? Hey , MK , is there any way that I can talk to Susan ? If there 's anyone who can help me , it 's her . There 's always a way . Two pieces of ID . Sign the visitor information form , third line from the bottom . Okay . Donnie needs a lawyer , Felix . Adele is a lawyer . Though , she 's currently under suspension for being inebriated in court . But that 's good for you because your bank accounts are frozen . - Well , what does she know ? - A lot . She 's far superior to legal aid . I mean about clones . Excuse me , pardon me . Sorry . Sorry ... Goddamn shoes . Sorry . I had to park at the far end of the lot . Y 'all don 't even have valet here . It 's a prison . I 'm kidding , I 'm Adele . You must be ... Oh . Yeah . Forgot to mention that . Alison is Sarah 's twin sister . Oh . Oh , thank God . I thought Mama was losing it for a minute . You look just like her , except with , you know , less anger and more hygiene . Felix , this isn 't gonna work . - She reeks of alcohol . - Ma 'am , you 're about to miss your visitation window . Excuse me . I 'm in conference with my client and she will not be denied her right to see her husband . Let me just have a look at this . I don 't want anyone frisking you . It 's not as fun as it sounds . Severe panvasculitis . Also , signs of meningoencephalitis and segmental enteritis . So what do you suppose that means ? That we 'll find a rhabdo-virus . I think it means we 're studying the wrong species . We 're all aware of our disease now , Susan . It 's all on the table . Yes , Charlotte is aware we will be starting a variety of treatments . Treatments do not mean a cure . We 'd like to know what the long-term plan is . I suggest you take up a hobby too . Ira , have you shown her your toy soldiers ? Yes , perhaps I should take up carpentry . I can build us all coffins . Shall I start with the smallest first ? Hey , did you manage to make contact with Susan ? MK says she can . She 's hacked Susan out on some island . We 're going to make her help Cosima . Well , that 's the main thing , keep pressing on for a cure . Yeah , well , there 's still Evie Cho and her cop . We don 't know what their next move is . You all right , Mum ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . - You wanna talk about it ? - No . Not now . Cup of tea ? Ta . Okay , I 'm patching you in now . - Look . - Sarah ? How are you doing that ? Evie is monitoring all my communications . It 's encrypted . She won 't see it . Hello , Sarah . It appears we 're all in the same boat now . - Charlotte . - 1 doubt that . Hi , love . You should go back to your book . Where are you going ? I just , uh , have to run an errand . I 've been trying to cure the disease ever since it first appeared . But without the original , I 'm sorry , I can 't . That 's not good enough . - Mom . Mom . - I agree . What do you suggest ? - Mom . - You need to work with someone who knows what they 're doing . Someone who can actually help . Hey . Surprise . Cosima . It 's good to see you again . Uh , yeah , I 'm a bit conflicted about it considering who your roommate is . - Yo , Rachel . - Yo . - What about ... - Mom . What are you doing ? You knew that was important . S left . What ? Where 'd she go ? I don 't know , she had her gun and she went out . What ? S ? You saw a gun ? Yeah , we 're reduced to lab notes , but , urn , I 've uploaded what we had left of , uh , the viruses - we were working on . - I have them . I see you 've been trying to engineer your own vectors . Wow , Rachel , I thought you were more into corporate power than hard science . As you know , I have a long perspective on our ailment . Scotty , look who wants to be on the team . Rachel ? Hello , Scott . How are you ? She stabbed us in the back . I 'm not working with her . She even cheats at Agricola . Okay . Sorry , Susan . If you wanna move forward , Rachel 's out . You know what , Ira , you can leave too . All right . If that 's what makes you comfortable . You can 't afford to exclude us , Cosima . Bye-bye . A musical ? Yes , we have the rehearsal tonight . Donnie ! Donnie , sweetie , they make you wear one of those horrible things ? Honey , just be cool , okay ? You the lawyer ? - Hmm ? - You the ... You the ... - Oh ! - You the lawyer ? Oh , yeah . I 'm kind of a stopgap , but , yeah . She 's Felix 's sister , Adele . Felix has a sister ? Just ... just don 't think about it right now . But ... How much does she know ? I don 't need to know anything just yet , okay ? Nothing that might incriminate you . All right , Donnie , gonna give you a little jail house 101 . - Oh , yeah , I think I could use that . - Okay . Uh , while you 're inside , you do ... Donnie ? While you 're inside , you do not talk to the police . Okay ? You don 't talk to the people in the common areas and you don 't talk to your celly . All right ? The only people you should be talking to are Alison and me . - Okay ? - Got it , yeah . In the meantime , we 're gonna be collecting affidavits from community members and friends . I mean , the bail hearing is basically about just proving you 're not a flight risk . See , we 're in good hands . Hey ! What 's so important ? I think Siobhan 's about to do something rash . In the car . Okay , so how rash ? Like , you know , take out the cop who killed her mum . What ? She 's got a rifle . I think that 's what she 's up to . She 's gonna make everything worse . No matter how bent Duko is , she can 't go killing a cop . I know , I should 've seen it coming . It 's some black Irish shit . You know , revenge first , consequences later . Okay , okay . I 'll talk to someone who I can trust on this . We 'll find ' em . 'Cause you got arrested on a Friday , your bail hearing 's not gonna be until Monday . - Monday ? - Mmm-hmm . It is a classic dick move cops pull to sweat someone . That way they can hold you for two days without charge . I don 't know why they have it in for us . Well , that 's what we 'll find out when we go to the bail hearing . Okay ? You guys have bail , right ? Adele , can I just talk to my wife for a second ? - Yep , yep , sure . - Thank you . Honey ... Do you see that guy over there ? Hmm ? Do you see that guy over there ? Don 't look ! Don 't look . He 's a Neolutionist . They put him in here with me . Oh , Donnie ... Be cool , okay ? Stop telling me to " be cool " ! I 'm not cool ! I know that , but you just ... just ... He said he 's here to keep an eye on me . Oh , God , Donnie . Oh , Lord . Sweet baby Jesus . I 'm not gonna make it two more days in here , Alison . Donnie , I know who 's done this . It 's this detective . He showed up after you were arrested . Duko . He 's behind all of it . Are you serious ? No , no , that 's okay . Yeah , yeah , thanks , Raj . Duko is fully AWOL , turned off the GPS in his car . So how are we gonna find him ? Shite . - Mrs. Hendrix . - What do you want ? Let 's not make this about me . So how 's Donnie ? Oh , thank God . - S , where the hell are you ? - Doesn 't matter . What matters is I think I know how Evie Cho is gonna try and get to us . Why is Neolution harassing my husband ? Donnie 's innocent . You know what , this has got nothing to do with you and Donnie . You 're just caught in the crossfire . And the people I work for would be more than happy to let you and your family live your lives . But what do they want ? I think you know . We all know who the real fly in the ointment here is . I don 't know why they don 't just leave Sarah alone . She 's not a threat to Neolution . Not my call . I just need to find her . Well , I don 't know where she is . I don 't . Jail 's not a good place for a sensitive man like Donnie . I don 't know how long he can survive in there . God . So you just have a little think about it , okay ? Where would you find Sarah ? The location . And I 'm gonna get back in touch with you real soon . Son of a biscuit ! - Shit ! - Alison ? Are you , uh ... You all right ? - Let me ... Let me help you with this . - I 'm sorry . I don 't know what came over me . Oh , well , I do . You see , I ... I was there when he was arrested , remember ? Come on , Ali . So how is Donnie doing ? He 's fine . Very comfortable in orange . You and Donnie are stalwart members of our congregation . But recently I ... I feel like you 've begun to take your ... Your faith for granted . Reverend , the ... The ... The police and the arrest , that was all a huge misunderstanding . Was it ? I 'm sure the children who witnessed it are gonna be just fine . You know , with proper therapy . All I know , Ali , is you 've got a secret laying heavy on your heart , and I can help you . Hmm . It 's an impossible situation , no one can help . Just ... just try me . What if someone asked you to do something and if you did it , then you would protect someone you love , but hurt someone else that you care about ? Is Donnie one of those people ? Donnie 's your husband , Ali . You made a vow to love and protect him right ... Right here in this very church . Yes . But ... You know , this might be one of the questions that ... That only the Lord can answer . So ... So what you do is you ... You open yourself up , and let Him guide you . Okay , so ... I 'm gonna leave the two of you alone now . Alison might be uptight , paranoid and occasionally delusional , but she 's not a rat , you guys . We didn 't say she was a rat , we said she was being squeezed , maybe . - What if she cracks ? - She trusts you . Just ... just check in with her . See if she 'll confide something . - Wear that . - No , wear that . Piss off , both of you ! Go spy on your own bloody sister . Remember , I 've got Adele trying to help her . Yeah ? Oh , bugger . - Hello , Alison , everything all right ? - Yes , yes . Um , where 's Sarah ? Um , why ? What 's happened ? Uh ... Felix , could you come by the church today ? It 's rehearsal and I , um , need you . Sure , yeah , I can come right now . Okay , thank you . See , the vectors that we engineered seemed hopeful . But it ... It took us months to come up with even those few . And you had success with the initial testing ? One of our big problems is we can 't get Cosima 's cell population to grow past the lag phase . And I 'm not even sure we 're using the right viruses . You 've used both retro and adenoviruses . - Have you tried naked DNA ? - Have you seen our lab ? We have major trouble controlling contamination . Still , it 's remarkable what you 've achieved with so little . I assume that you 've used Kira 's cells again ? Yeah , they were helpful in a few attempts , but the father 's contribution to her DNA takes them way too far from the LEDA genome . Whereas with the original stern cells , we could induce from any direction we want . Embryonic stern cells . What if we created a blastocyst ? The ball of cells would contain all the stem cells we need . We 'd need fertilizable LEDA eggs . And CASTOR sperm from Ira . Where are you gonna get the eggs from ? Oh . Sarah and I will be right by the phone . If it looks like Alison is playing ball with Duko , we have to cut and run . Okay . Yeah . Hey , this is MK . Yeah ? - I found something . - What have you got ? I went spear fishing on Duko . Your detective receives payments from a Brightborn shell to an account in the Caribbean . He hid it well , but I found it . That 's good , Art will love that . What else ? There 's worse . Much more damning . He 's dangerous , Sarah . I 'll e-mail you what I found . We 'll take whatever we can get , MK . Sarah ? Thank you . I didn 't know if you 'd let me back in . Me neither . Uh , talk soon , yeah ? After the way she left last time , why did she come back ? I don 't know . God , what we don 't know about MK could fill a library . What is happening to me ? Five , six , seven , eight ... Okay . No , we ... No , no , no . We can 't both enter from the same side . I thought that 's what you said we should do . - There you go . - Yes , but then I saw - how stinky it was and we ... - Okay , okay . - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I 'm just ... - Do you need a minute , hon ? Yes , yes , I 'm gonna do my face . Alison ! Oh scheisse , Felix . Come . So what is going on , darling ? What 's wrong ? You look terrified . No , no , but , yes ... But I just feel so out of the loop . What ... What 's everybody doing ? I ... I haven 't heard anything from Sarah . Oh , I thought that maybe there was something wrong with Donnie . No , just jail . And how are you ? How 's Alison doing ? - Any more police or anything like that ? - What do you mean ? No , no . Oh , okay . I just thought maybe they 'd be investigating or , you know , looking for evidence . Finding out who Donnie might know ... I wouldn 't tell them . Of course not , no . I know that you know to keep things close to the vest . - Yeah ? - Mmm-hmm . Sarah 's just thinking that maybe this Detective Duko might be coming after you or for Evie Cho . Oh , she 's probably forgotten all about us . Urn , is everything okay ? - Yep , I just have to do something . - Oh . Look , I know that you 're under a lot of pressure . But you need to keep strong , okay ? Of course . Your sisters are there for you . Mmm-hmm . Sarah is there for you . - Hello , Alison ... - Oh . I don 't know where Sarah is . I understand . These are , uh , decisions of the heart . Here 's someone who might be able to help you with that . Hello ? Ali , honey ? Oh , Donnie . Donnie , are you okay ? What ... What 's wrong ? You remember that Neolution guy ? He 's in my cell . With a shank . - A what ? - A shank . A shiv , it 's what we call a knife in here . It 's a sharpened toothbrush , okay ? Listen . He says if you don 't tell them what they want to know , he 's gonna stick it in my brain through my eye . Oh , Donnie . Donnie ? It 's your choice , Alison . It 's up to you . Sarah will be at a comic book shop called The Rabbit Hole tonight . Okay . Good . If that 's true , I 'm gonna call the psycho back . Donnie 's gonna be fine . He 's gonna be out of there on Monday . But if it 's not true , you have to say a little prayer . Duko 's call 's not coming .

I don 't know , she doesn 't like clones ? Sarah 's a threat ! It 's all coming together for Evie , you people might interfere . Don 't do it before the question ! Jesus ! What 's Evie up to , Martin ? She 's got approval for her bot technology , she 's planning on putting into millions of people , under the guise of gene therapy . But what 's she really doing ? I don 't know . Remaking man in her own image , by chopping my balls off ? It 's not my end of things ! Jesus ! Thank you . Thank you . No . I 'll work for you . Every case we found with Brightborn connections , you were the investigator . You 're a corrupt and mercenary man , Detective . Subjects murdered , witnesses disappeared . They threatened my family . My little niece . And paid you well , to your Cayman account . We found that , too . They said they 'd kill her . My niece , Meline , is , like , 10 . She has no one . It 's a pretty name . I had to take that money . I put it aside for her . - So she 'd be taken care of . - Exactly . It 's about family . Oh , I get it . No , no . No . - No , no . - This is for my ma . No , no , no , no ... Hey . Cosima 's downstairs . Sarah , this is big . We couldn 't get my cells to create a useable culture . But I figured that if we match a fertile LEDA egg ... That 's the part I don 't like . My egg . With CASTOR , yes . So totally out of line . But that 's the two parts of Kendall Malone 's biology , re-joined . So fertilize my egg with CASTOR sperm . - That 's your eureka moment ? - Yeah . Don 't mess with me , Cos . I 'm not . I 'm really not . This is the breakthrough we 've been waiting for . Is it ? The only problem is we don 't have the resources to do it alone . Oh , shit , what are you doing ? Cosima 's coming here ? I look forward to working with her . She 's a deft mind . Her proposal 's quite elegant , really . Yes , I 'm sure you 're very excited about your contribution , Ira . Anything for science . Science isn 't everything . Certainly not Evie Cho 's science . There 's still time to stop her . I want to go back , Mother . I want to work with Sarah Manning and the others to restore you as the head of Neolution . They need Evie removed as much as ... Oh . Are you all right , Rachel ? Yes . Yes , I 'm fine . Are you sure you can work with Sarah ? I look forward to it . Sarah 's fine , recovering from the procedure at home . Great . Tell her , her eggs are airborne . Oh , man . Scott , I wish you could see this . I 've never been this far north . It 's amazing ! Have you thought about how insane you are ? Jumping in a chopper to a mad scientist 's private island ? Dude , we are mad scientists . Don 't be a hater . Now you 're really scaring me . Where 's your sense of adventure , Scott ? I just want you to find a cure . We will . Two hundred and sixty new jobs . The government approvals have come through . Then we should act now . Oh , Donnie . Thank God . - I don 't wanna screw this up . - Relax . We 're merely fertilizing LEDA with CASTOR . You were right about Brightborn . It 's way worse than I thought . It 's over , Felix . Hey , Helena ! Oh , Lord ! Hello , Rachel . This is a bad idea .

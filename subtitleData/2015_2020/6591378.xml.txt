 We 're clones . We 're lab rats in an illegal experiment . These were Rachel 's parents . Project Leda ... I mean , it 's total military speak . The military created us ? We 're sick . Your little girls are dying . Your attempts to make new clones should meet with failure . I want the key to your cipher . The Island Of Dr Moreau ... Professor Duncan gave it to me for a present . For the embryos . Those are my babies ? In nine months , we 'll be welcoming a brand-new you into the world . My father is the father . I 'm carrying your babies . SCREAMS AND LAUGHTER - Did you burn down the fish people 's ranch ? - No . Auntie Cosima ! You will no longer be working with clones . - Frankfurt . - None of this is personal . If you let her die without me it is personal ! Kira gave her bone marrow to cure Cosima . Enjoy your oophorectomy . Sarah will never forgive me . You did what you had to . My name is Marion Bolts . I 'm from Topside . We ... steer the Dyad group . This is Project Castor . SUMMERY MUSIC Oi , Meathead , I don 't think those are going to fit . They are very little . Maybe you can wear them on your fingers . They 're not for her , silly ! Helena 's going to have a little monkey too . Monkey number two . Felix , that ox liver smells fantastic ! Doesn 't it ? It 's our sestra 's favourite . Marinated in Horilka all day . Mmm , that 'll go perfectly with these . Hey , you going to say thank you ? Thank you , sestra Alison . Oh , heavens , just a few things I made . This is your special day , Helena . You and your precious cargo . Dude , you look awesome . You look awesome , also , sestra . You are well ? Oh , yeah , I am like way better , thanks to science . Check it out . Babka cake . Mm-hmm . Kielbasa . Go ahead . Dig in , you 're eating for two now . MUSIC WINDS DOWN AND STOPS SHE GASPS SHE SCREAMS SHE BREATHES HEAVILY Relax , Helena . You remember me , don 't you ? Yes , Pupok . It 's been a long time . You 're being tested again . And this time you 're carrying a child . It 's hot here . I can taste sand . They took me from my sestras . Nobody said it was going to be easy , kiddo . BEEPING Are there still fish in the water ? Yeah , sleepy fish because we never come to visit . Darling , why don 't you take a stroll by the bend and see if you can find some fish ? Not too far . See if you can find the monkeyfish . OK . Well , it has been a while since we 've been back to Shite Beach . It was your memorial . That was lovely . - Vic spoke . - Can we just enjoy this , please ? Enjoy military boy clones with scars all over their faces ? - Don 't pretend this is over , Sarah . - Marion is handling it . Marion has already buggered off to Europe . To cover for us . She 's controlling Dyad , it 's the only reason I got out . Nothing is benevolent with these people , Sarah . You know it , we 've seen it time and again . Who 's that ? What did I tell you , Sarah ? The penny 's going to drop . Kira ? C 'mere . It 's Delphine . God , she looks good . Until three weeks ago , we didn 't even know Project Castor existed . They were a myth . But now they 're a bomb . - and shock waves are coming . - These guys aren 't my problem . I 'm sorry , they are . Rachel has powerful friends , and you put a pencil in her eye . Listen , please . There are threats to Leda from outside and in . And Marion , she sent me , yes , to protect Dyad , but to keep your sisters safe . - Right . - At any cost . Have you even talked to your girlfriend yet ? I need to show you how we caught him . Who 's that ? Her name is Krystal Goderitch . I don 't want to see this shit . It gets worse . Another one . We intercepted them as they were forcing her into the trunk of a car . Now , Krystal was lucky , she lived . But this one killed two members of the security team . And the other one got away . Why ? What were they after ? He hasn 't told us so much as his name . And now he says he 'll only talk with you . Well , here I am . You 're a legend , Sarah Manning . You got a name , or a serial number or some shit I can call you ? You 're made of the good stuff , aren 't you ? Krystal had no idea what she was made of . Found the whole concept very confusing . - I never met her . - No . But you met Alison and Cosima . And the rest , as they say at Dyad , is , uh ... c 'est histoire . 'What do you want with us ? ' The walls have ears . Come closer , I 'll whisper it to you . I met one of your brothers , too . I think I know which one . Yeah , I kicked him in the face . You think that 's funny ? He wasn 't a soldier . He was a Prolethean . Was he ? Hard to tell who 's who these days . I mean , what is the Wild One doing with Dyad ? I 'm not with Dyad . You 're trusting the wrong people . I only trust my sisters . I know , it 's a family affair . With Felix . And your step mum , Mrs Sadler . And of course ... little Kira . A child . How special you are . You talk about my family , you come near them , I will kill you . Pull her out . Pull her out , now . Sarah ... Count your sisters . I 'm fine , Sarah , thank you for asking , but any boy clone who crosses the Hendrixes is going to get his butt kicked . Girls ! No bunching ! What about you , Fee ? Doing fine . We 're just hanging out here , with my new roomie , Cosima . Oh , fishsticks ! Ref ! I 'm sorry , I have to go . I have to go , Sarah . 'Bye . ' Cosima 's temperature 's down to normal , by the way . She 's got a bit of colour in her cheeks . 'And Helena ? ' Helena 's an albino . 'Tell Sarah that Helena hasn 't came back . ' - What ? ! - Is she talking to Delphine ? Is she with Delphine ? Cosima 's telling me to tell you Helena still hasn 't shown up . - Oh , shit . - ' And I think her bag 's gone . ' I 've got a bad feeling about this . Well , what do you want us to do about it ? Ummm ... Meet me at S 's , yeah ? - OK . - Yeah ? - Bye . - OK . Helena 's missing . No , no . You and I , we have other priorities . No , we don 't . My priority 's my sister . And you 're going to go see Cosima . I warned you about a threat from within . Topside is sending an investigator to Dyad . To assess the security risk posed by you and your sisters . - That 's your problem . - No , it 's our problem . The man that is coming is a cleaner . He cannot find out what we did to Rachel . So you 're going to have to play your part . What part ? You have to play Rachel . Oh , piss off , Delphine . Sarah , please , we are in this together . Please . I 'm leaving . And you 're not stopping me , are you ? Yeah ? OK , so I 'm going to send you - you sit at the very back . - OK ? You guys sit together . - Yooo hooo ! Alison ! Hi ! OK , up you get . Driving the Soccer Starz bus ? Look at you helping out . Marci . What can I do for you ? Well , don 't worry , I 'm not trying to list your house ! It 's election time again . So can I count on your support for School Trustee ? You 're the incumbent , I 'm pretty sure you 're safe , Marci . Honestly , Alison ? I am so inspired by your recovery . You are still a community leader in Bailey Downs . And you know what ? Maybe , in exchange for just a smidge of campaigning , I could help revive your monthly potluck . Um . I heard you plan to tinker electoral boundaries , taking Bailey Downs out of the Glendale school district . Well , uh , it 's just one possibility . That would mean my kids have to change schools . So instead of supporting you , I 've been thinking of running against you . Really ? Yeah . So , best of luck to you . OK , up you get . Everybody on . Let 's go . What are you doing here ? I finally did it , Ali . I finally told Susan Teller what was what . Oh , my God , you got fired . It was frickin ' glorious . I called her a bitch to her face . - Donnie , that 's enough . - What ? People are watching . You shush your mouth , and I will see you at home . Um ... They took the keys to the Taurus . Honey , they took my Taurus . Dad ? Why are you here ? OK , go inside , go inside , OK ? Good , Gemma . OK , everybody , hands in , windows up ! On the bus , Donnie . Get on the bus . OK . Hi , everybody . You know my face ? Never had the pleasure . That 's not what I asked . Honestly , I don 't know you , son . Think hard . One . Of a kind . You 're a Castor ? Professor Ethan Duncan was here . Major Dierden agreed that Project Castor would leave me and mine out of this . I 'm not under Dierden 's orders . Where is Duncan now ? With Dyad ? You 're making your big entrance too late , love . Duncan went in to Dyad , and cared for it so little he made himself dead . All right . His research . Where is it ? At the Dyad , I assume . Not the sharpest knife in the box , are you , pet ? The eye was lost ... She sustained some trauma to the frontal lobe . It 's too early to predict ... impairment . Topside is sending Ferdinand . He lands in three hours . Topside took action on Leda before . There was an incident , in 2006 . - Helsinki . - Yes . Marion briefed me . I 'm here so it doesn 't happen again . I 've talked to Sarah . She mustn 't uncover Helsinki . Not even Rachel knows . Can I count on you , Dr Nealon ? To put Leda above its individuals ? Neither of us can afford to play favourites now , can we ? No , we can 't . ECHOING VOICES AND FOOTSTEPS Can you hear us ? Two bloody boy clones in one day . What the hell is it that they want all of a sudden ? This one wanted Duncan . His " research " . Sorry . Sarah . I made ... I made a war-time decision . It 's only a matter of time before you find out . What have you done ? It was the only way I could see to get you out of Dyad . Marion wanted Castor information , and Paul wanted something in return ... Helena . It 's what I had to do at the time . - What ? Betray my sister ? Give her to them ? - For Kira . That is not your bloody decision , S , is it ! Does Dyad know about this ? Did Cal ? No . It was Paul 's demand , I ... I had to choose . Sarah , stop , come on ... Please . Don 't turn your back on me , not on your people . You 're not my people . Great . Stick me in the middle with a bloody apple in my mouth . Please , go after her , don 't let her make it worse . Well , she 's going to make it worse , she will , but right now I need to get you to a hospital , so I 'm calling Benjamin . Scarlett just fell on her face . Ouch . Like there 's a cliff , and there 's barely any water at the bottom . Hey , can I ask you something ? Yeah . Do you remember when you were waking me up to tell me to read that story to you ? Yeah . Yeah ? I was having this dream I was like , way above . And I could see below . And then I came back - to you . Did you feel that thing ? - I don 't know . - Yeah , I don 't know , too . I don 't really have words for what I 'm trying to say . You had to come back so Delphine can make you better with my stem cells . KNOCK ON DOOR Hello ? Cosima ? It 's me . Hey ! I 'm so happy you 're back . I only have a minute , so ... Oh , OK . Just a minute ? You 're not wearing your cannula . Are you feeling OK ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Don 't . Don 't ... don 't mother me . What 's going on ? I 'm looking for Sarah . Is she here , because she won 't answer my calls ? No . I 'm sorry , this Rachel problem is very critical , so I need her help . Could you just talk to me ? I am taking over some of Rachel 's duties . So I won 't be working with you and Scott for a while . So , you 're the new Rachel . - Awesome . - Cosima ... I 'm keeping my promise - to love all of your sisters equally . But to do that , I can 't do this . You understand ? OK . I get it . Your minute 's up , you should probably just go . We all have a part to play . Me , Sarah , Alison . But yours is to cure . Yourself and all of your sisters . I love you . - Scott is going to come to do a - check up . OK . Well , I 've run the numbers . You can 't run from numbers , Donnie . We have one mortgage payment left . Well , we 're not taking from our retirement fund . Look , look , look . I 've got ... 347.82 in expenses from when I was a monitor . So that 's good . Plus , I 'm incredibly employable . But you know , honey , I was thinking maybe you could ... work with your mum again part-time at Bubbles for a bit . I will dig ditches for this family , but I am not going back to my mother 's store . Besides , I have a bee in my bonnet . - I want to run for school trustee . - You do ? Well , Marci Coates wants to change the district boundaries . - I know . I heard she 's manipulating real estate prices . - Yes ! - Yeah , Marci 's got to go . - Mm-hm . For the kids . Yes . PHONE ALERT Oh , it 's Dyad . There was an emergency , Sarah 's up to her eyeballs . She OK ? Hello ? Delphine ? How could S do that to Helena ? I mean , who am I meant to call family now ? You can 't put them all under your wing . What should I do ? Should I abandon her ? Just like everyone else has done her entire life ? For you and Kira , I 'd have done the same thing . I 'd have done the same thing that Siobhan did . Leave S out of it , please . PHONE RINGS This is the other thing . Delphine . Delphine 's got your number ? Well , we definitely need new clone phones . She wants my help saving Leda and Dyad . Jesus . Don 't these people know you never even finished high school ? Piss off . Maybe she can help me . Help you with what ? Help you with Helena ? Yeah . Please don 't . Please ... Hi , Delphine . I won 't condone this , Delphine . Rachel 's a stretch for her . It will be brief . Ferdinand knows Rachel , but it 's ... it 's my meeting . You can just say hello and then excuse yourself . You have a cleaner named Ferdinand ? You don 't think I can do this ? Rachel Duncan , uber-bitch . That was terrible . If you 're going to do this , then you need to wear white , OK ? White dazzles , God knows you 'll need distraction . - Yeah , that 's good . - The deal is , you 're going to help me with Helena . - Don 't say yes . - Yes . But let 's take it one step at time . Well , Castor has her . So what are you going to do about that ? Everything I can . But first we need to get through this ... inquisition . Ferdinand can sense anything amiss . If we falter , he will smell it . Well , don 't falter , Delphine . Give us some space . I have to change . 96 over 60 . - Hey ! - So your blood pressure 's pretty good . - Yeah . - How 's your heart ? Oh . I 'm done with the French . Seriously , Cosima . With soldier clones running around , and you know , all this lesbian drama ... uh , I don 't know that I want to work on the super secret shit any more . OK . Yeah , I get it . Um ... but you might want to check this out . The Island Of Dr Moreau ? It was a gift from Professor Duncan . Dude ... This could be ... his key . To unlock the rest of the synthetic sequences . - Mm-hm . - Does Delphine know you have this ? I 've learned from Dyad that secrets are power . And until you and I decipher it , no-one 's going to know about it . Not even my sisters . Welcome to the Dyad Institute . Enjoy your oophorectomy . Ferdinand . Welcome . Delphine Cormier . Dr Cormier . Yes . Rachel . Nice to see you again , Ferdinand . I 'm so sorry , I 'm between flights ... I need you both . Please . In the light of the Castor revelation , Topside has engaged me to conduct a security review of Dyad . We understand . Marion has held a living , breathing Castor subject in her basement - for three weeks ... - Yes . - .. without reporting it . I believe she needed genetic confirmation . Like you , I 've only just been brought up to speed . Who else is aware ? Dr Nealon , Rachel , and myself are the only ones in the loop . Paul Dierden . It appears he was a Castor mole . You let him get right next to you . He was her monitor . Dr Leekie put him there . You have consent over your monitors . I consented , yes . To Dr Leekie 's choice . There 's more . Castor has kidnapped Helena , Sarah Manning 's maternal twin . Is this true ? Yes . - You 're holding Sarah Manning . Correct ? - Yes . I 'd like to question her . Is that really necessary ? It is . Necessary . Whatever you need . After you , Rachel . Holy doodle , here we go . Oi , oi , Rachel . Shut up . Never gets old , does it ? Yeah , it does . Take it as a compliment , Miss Manning . You have a face to fight wars for . But when the wild seed blows back into the fold with something like Castor on her heels , I get suspicious . What 's Castor ? What 's that ? Sarah . This is very important . In all your unmonitored wanderings through our murky history , have you ever met a male clone ? Answer the question . No , why ? Are you one ? No ? Never met a soldier boy ? No whisperings from Professor Duncan ? No . I 've only met my sisters . - Sisters . - Yeah . You really are the wild one , aren 't you ? Tell me , Rachel , 50 years from now , do you think your kind will still be calling each other sister ? I would hope we 'd just be another person in the checkout line . HE CHUCKLES Jolly good . What are you doing ? ! What are you doing ? ! - Ferdinand , please ... - Uh-uh-uh . Wh-What 's happening ? I thought you were recovering from surgery . Get your hands off me , you pig ! You watch your mouth ! Ferdinand , may we have a word ? We had to postpone the oophorectomy . Your goal is to isolate her fecundity ASAP . Why are you waiting ? I 'm not a doctor . You cannot remove the ovary of a woman who is ovulating . I know it 's inconvenient . But she 's contained . No risk to Topside . Then remove her to her cell , please . I know you 're lying . About flying anywhere tonight . Is that for my benefit ? Or hers ? I wouldn 't attempt to pull the wool over your eyes , Ferdinand . I 'm surprised that your nemesis is still breathing . - Why did you let him do that ? - Sh ! Not getting cold feet , are you ? Things are already in motion . Sarah 's biology is too unique to waste . So , by the way , is Helena 's . We need to locate her . We ... need to discuss Helsinki . Well , I want to discuss Helena . Then I 'll come to you tonight , when I 've finished here . All right ? I look forward to it . He 's doing it again . Guy thinks he 's the naked Buddha . I 'm doing my rounds , I 'll be back . Don 't ... don 't worry about me , guys . OK ? Sarah , these people are dangerous . I thought Mr Rubber Gloves was going to throttle me on the spot . I know , I 'm sorry . I just don 't believe that Helena is a priority for Delphine . We have to make our own moves . No , you 're right . We can 't rely on anyone but ourselves . We should ... we should go after her . The poor thing . No . No , no , no . You tell Sarah I don 't want you doing anything like this ever again . KNOCK ON DOOR I got to go . Be careful , Sarah . Hey , I love you guys . Yeah , me too . Hello , again . INSTRUMENTS BEEP Hello , Rachel . I warned you this was personal . What day is it ? Hm ? Mm ... Da ... - What 's my name ? - Ma ... Come on . - What ? - What ... happened to my c ... .. corncob ? Oh , come on . Come on , you can do better than that . SHE MOANS - What 's my name ? - Stop ! Stop , Delphine . There ! There we go . There you go , good girl . Only I 'm you now . Do you understand that ? I 'm you ... and I will erase you completely , Rachel , unless you tell me what you 're planning with Ferdinand . - Ferdinand ? - Yeah . What have you got going on with him ? - Mm ... - Don 't lie , because I saw it . You ... You saw ... - You saw ... - Come on . Helsinki ? Oh ... you wicked sister . You 're not supposed to know about that . Now , what else do you know ? Hm ? You 're going to talk to me . SHE GROANS You 're going to talk to me . CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS Drink ? Same as last time ... at the Kronenhalle Bar . You 've come all this way , why not try some local colour ? Rachel , Rachel , Rachel . Why haven 't you been returning my calls ? Appearances , Ferdinand . Bourbon rocks . So , the subject was Helena . You 're not yourself . Did you sleep with Paul Dierden ? He was my monitor . What do you think ? I think ... he was your bitch . HE SHUDDERS Hello , again . Who 's a dirty clone ? You are . You 're avoiding Helena . I want you to consider a prisoner swap with Castor . Agh ! This has nothing to do with Castor . This is about Helsinki . You wanted this ! Marion is too soft - you said it yourself , if we didn 't act , your sisters could expose Topside . Helsinki is the only option . There are other options . No , it 's too late . Be strong , huh ? The Helsinki girls were eradicated in 24 hours - six clones , 32 collateral . As soon as you have Sarah 's ovaries , put her down . We 'll induce Cosima tomorrow . She 'll deteriorate rapidly . And Alison Hendrix ? It 's under way . Family chloroformed ... - followed by a house fire . - HE CHUCKLES Proven effective by the Finns . Excuse me . I need a moment . PHONE VIBRATES - Pick up . VOICEMAIL : - Hello , you 've reached Alison Hendrix , I 'm away from the phone , but leave a message ... - Oh , shit . - .. and I 'll get back to you in a jiff . BEEP Alison , get out of your house now . Take the kids ... DOOR OPENS .. and get yourself away ... Who are you talking to in here ? No ... No-one . What game are you playing , Rachel ? Hmm ? What are you up to ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Something is going on . If you 're not careful , Helsinki will swallow you too , and you won 't get what you want . I want my sisters spared . No . You want the child . Don 't you ? More than anything ? So , if you 're having second thoughts ... .. remember Kira . Please ... Poor , damaged Rachel . What happened to you ? Hmm ? Who 's behind that face ? You don 't recognise me , Ferdinand ? Do you recognise me now ? Yes . LIGHTS CLICK BELT CRACKS HE LAUGHS Do you recognise me now ? Yes . Yes , yes . Pull it . Argh ! Remember our safe word ? No . Argh ! BIRD SQUAWKS HE CHOKES Stop ! Come on , stop ! Come on . Get up , go . What is this ? Shut up and stop squirming . I ... I am sanctioned by Topside ... To conduct a security review of self-aware clones . Not screw our product . Helsinki 's happening , Delphine . Won 't Marion be impressed ? Conspiring with one clone to murder the others . Now who will pay for this , hmm ? Her ? Topside 's favourite pet ? Or you , Ferdinand ? Because they will kill you . What do you want ? DOOR CLOSES Marion will meet us in Zurich . You report to Topside that Dyad is secure . And self-aware Leda clones an essential evolution of the programme . - I know how leverage works . - Good . Wait for me downstairs . Rachel ... Rachel was going to eliminate us . - Everybody we love . - Yes . They 've done it before . You should have told me . I only did this for Helena . I know . I counted on it . You said you 'd help me find her . I already am . But until I figure out what Castor really is , you need to stand down . Don 't try anything else . I 'll be back . CHITTERING My legs hurt . SCORPION : Picture a box , inside a box , inside a box ... She 's been in almost 48 hours . All right , in you go . SCORPION : Congratulations . You escaped the first box . HE SIGHS I swear , this guy 's from another world or something . LOCK BUZZES Hello , brother . I 'm trying to figure out what these maniacs are after . She says they have the same tattoo . Both the Leda and Castor originals are lost . Yet another mystery . Helena . I 'm very happy to meet you . I could beat her , Donnie - I could beat her like a French meringue . You have your orders . We 're going to finish the job .

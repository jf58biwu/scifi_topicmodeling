Thompson : Carter ? She 's moved on to a new case . You 're yesterday 's news for her . I need your help . It called me here . It wants to be let out . Should you really be touching her ? Yes . I have to . I need an atomic bomb . The two remaining warheads were put in storage . Well , it won 't be the first time we 've infiltrated a roxxon facility . Jarvis : The elevator requires a special key . Talk mr . Jarvis through the procedure . I 'll take care of our company . [ groaning ] [ grunting ] You said you moved here because you wanted a fresh start , But that 's not the whole truth , is it ? I think you 're in love with peggy . Chadwick : Get the council together . I want to call an emergency meeting . They 're gonna want to hear this . Peggy , I - - Jason ! Jason ! [ distorted ] jason ! Can you hear me ? [ wind roaring ] Can you hear me ? Jason ? Jason ? ! [ gasps ] What happened ? I-I-I - - I don 't know . I-I was somewhere else . I-I don 't know . It 's all right . You 're back now . No , it - - it 's not all right . I can 't - - I can 't fight it anymore . I 've lost control , peggy . We 'll fix this . No ! No . I 'm at the whim of - - of some dark force That we have absolutely no understanding of . I could vanish forever at any moment , And we 'd have no idea when or what would happen next - - What do we know ? Your work at isodyne was in containment research . You built a housing unit for zero matter . Perhaps you can do something similar for yourself . That won 't work . Why ? Because I have no mass . I have no material form to contain . But if you did ? If I did , we wouldn 't be having this conversation . Jane scott 's tissue sample . When you were exposed to the zero matter from that , You were restored to a tangible state . Temporarily . If you could replicate that even briefly , Do you think you could build A containment chamber for yourself ? Yes . Y-yes , I think that might work . We need to get our hands on some more zero matter . And as far as we know , There 's only one place left in the world to find it . [ muttering ] And I did it . But then it went away , but I will get it back . Darling , are you okay ? Do I look like I 'm okay ? Sweetheart , I was - - No . No , what exactly has happened as of late , cal , That would lead you to believe that I 'm okay ? Whitney , please . Would it be the catastrophe , maybe , At the roxxon facility ? Or maybe you 're referring to the never-ending interference Of that twit federal agent And how she has crippled everything That I am trying to accomplish . Honey , everything 's gonna be fine . How can you say that ? ! Because I 've arranged for the council to meet with you . What did you say ? I thought long and hard about it through the night , And I realized that I haven 't been Giving you the proper support . And this is my way of rectifying my mistake . But the council never meets with outsiders , Let alone a woman . It took some convincing , And I did have to cash in all my chips . But you 're worth it . You 've always understood this stuff better than me . That 's why you need to be the one That addresses the council on zero matter And all its potential . You did that for me ? I did it for us . Now , everyone 's gonna be in attendance tomorrow night For the fundraiser . I think once the council sees what you 're capable of , Well , [ chuckles ] they 'll give you whatever you want . Oh , cal . Oh , thank you . Of course , my love . [ bird squawking ] Carter : Ooh . Does that go through your body ? It does , which is fortunate . Yes . Less likely to infect .

Says the woman with the rebar hole through her abdomen . Is anything the matter ? [ sighs ] You didn 't call me here to ask me about my emotional state . Right . Yes , I called you here because we have a problem . Just one ? Dr. Wilkes has lost his foothold here . Last night , he disappeared temporarily , And now he could vanish forever at any moment . We need to do something to anchor him into this world Until we find a more permanent solution . Whatever that something is , It 's already giving me indigestion . Daniel , not only is dr . Wilkes a good man , He is the centerpiece For the case we 're building against isodyne , whitney frost , And that arena social cabal . So you need him . We need him . All right . What 's the plan ? Dr. Wilkes has designed a containment chamber To stabilize himself , But he needs a sample of zero matter . I intend to get that sample from whitney frost . Okay . The best chance that we have Of getting close to whitney without being detected Is her husband 's campaign fundraiser Tomorrow night at the macarthur grand hotel . Not an easy ticket to get . Howard stark donates money to all the political candidates To ensure good favor with whomever wins , So mr . Jarvis has two tickets secured . Of course he does . We can modify this vacuum syringe from the ssr To get the sample of zero matter . We use the crowd to our advantage , We get close enough to puncture her skin , And then we make a hasty exit without any fuss . You 're gonna do this ? Yes . You , who can barely walk ? You , who whitney 's tried to kill within the past 48 hours ? You , who whitney will see coming a mile away - - Same as jarvis , by the way . Well , someone else , then . Who ? Me ?

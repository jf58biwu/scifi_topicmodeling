 [ NARRATOR ] Previously on Dark Matter . [ SIX ] It 's a nasty gash . [ WEXLER ] You know it 's really too bad , we could 've had some real fun together . [ THREE ] She got blown out the air lock . She held on , waiting to die and she didn 't . What the hell is she ? Think you could survive a bullet between the eyes ? [ gunshots ] [ SIX ] Whatever this thing is , three corporations were willing to kill for it . [ AGENT ] What the hell was that ? ! The field 's become unstable . Shut it down ! [ GRIFFIN ] What the hell is this ? [ MARCUS ] Kid 's a stowaway . I was just trying to scare her . I wasn 't gonna space her , I swear . [ DAS panting ] [ MARCUS ] At least let 's get something for her . [ GRIFFIN ] Shut up , Boone . Look guys , she 's an asset . She 's got a head for mechanics and tech . [ PORTIA ] I don 't give a shit . I don 't want her on this ship . [ DERRICK ( JACE ) ] Why the hell not ? She 's a child . [ DERRICK ( JACE ) ] Griff 's right . We should keep her . It 's even up . Your call , Ryo . Welcome aboard , little warrior . Just don 't give me any cause to regret my decision . [ THE ANDROID ] Two , I 've completed my analysis of all available sensor data pertaining to the explosion . Would you like to hear it ? [ TWO ] Maybe just the short version . [ THE ANDROID ] It was the temporary manifestation of what 's known in layman 's terms as a white hole . [ TWO ] Let me guess . The opposite of a black hole ? [ THE ANDROID ] Precisely . It 's an area of space-time which cannot be entered from the outside , but which is capable of emitting vast quantities of matter and energy . [ TWO ] ls there any chance it was a coincidence that it manifested five minutes after we delivered that device ? [ THE ANDROID ] It would be highly unlikely . Research into white hole technology was banned by the Galactic Authority several years ago because of its potential to destabilize the current balance of power between the major corporations . How many people were on that planet ? [ THE ANDROID ] The world was otherwise uninhabited , so the death toll was limited to those on the research facility . Are you sure you want the number ? How many ? A little over 15,000 . [ NEWS ANCHOR ] Galactic Authorities continue their investigation into what they 've classified as an Extinction Level Event on a Hab-1 world under the directorship of The Mikkei Combine . Satellite imagery captured the planet 's final moments ... The incident , which claimed the lives of all on-site personnel , is believed to have been triggered by illegal research into what has been termed a " Doomsday Weapon " linked to white hole technology . Representatives of The Mikkei Combine offered condolences to all those affected , but have otherwise refused comment pending completion of the official inquiry . Is that it ? This was the most relevant of several reports . No mention anywhere of our involvement ? None . [ THREE ] Guys , we 're in the clear . [ ONE ] Just because we 're not in the official news doesn 't mean we 're in the clear . Ugh . All I 'm saying is that it could be worse . Mikkei could 've hung us out to dry , but they didn 't , why ? Probably because they think that we got played just like they did . We 're not nearly as screwed as we thought we were . [ THE ANDROID ] I 'm receiving a coded subspace transmission . It 's from Calchek . Patch him through . What do you want ? Oh , you--you are all so screwed . [ ONE ] And by " screwed " you mean ... [ CALCHEK ] Certain parties within The Mikkei Combine think you set them up . We set them up ? ! They came to us with that job ! Which is why it 's always important to go through proper channels . Yeah , really sorry you didn 't earn your commission on that one . It 's a small price to pay for peace of mind . Okay , let me run this scenario by you . Traugott 's been doing RD on a white hole bomb . They 've got a prototype but they can 't test it without getting the G.A. on their backs . So what do they do ? They float word around about it , back-channel whispers , and guess who takes the bait ? Mikkei . They hired us to steal it . We do , deliver it , and once it 's safely into their hands , Traugott triggers the device and Mikkei gets to take the fall . Does that sound about right ? Huh , sounds about exactly right . Of course there 's the question of whether you were playing both sides . [ THREE sighs ] Come on . [ ONE ] Everyone knows we 've been untouchable since our fallout with Ferrous . [ CALCHEK ] Heh . Well , things change . See , Ferrous Corp. just reached out to me to reach out to you about a job . Why us ? [ CALCHEK ] Because they know you 're the best . And also because you have burned so many bridges that you are out of options . You either take this job and make nice with Ferrous Corp. , which , by the way , would be a very smart move while we wait for this Mikkei situation to shake out , or you are really on your own . Look , this time around you don 't have to steal anything . In fact , you 'll be saving someone , it 's a nice change of pace . Who ? [ CALCHEK ] A Ferrous Corp. scientist was kidnapped about a month ago by a rival combine . He 's being held in a lab in some backwater planet . Very little in the way of security . So it 's a simple snatch and grab . You 're in . You 're out . It 's a piece of cake . I hate cake . [ ONE ] So we get into Ferrous ' good books by getting in this other rival corp . ' s bad books ? [ CALCHEK ] Yes , you want Ferrous Corp. to be your friend . We 'll do it . [ THREE ] What ? Shouldn 't we talk about this ? No . We 'll do it . [ CALCHEK ] Excellent . I will send you the coordinates and , uh , good to be back in business with you . Are you sure ? The only thing I 'm sure about right now is that we need all the friends we can get . We 're taking this job . [ FOUR ] What 're you doing ? - - [ thud ] - -Ow ! [ FOUR ] Are you looking for something ? Yeah . I just , uh , dropped my , um ... nebulizer . All right . Well , good luck finding that . Oh , hey . Thanks . For what ? Everything ? [ FOUR chuckles ] [ ONE ] Looking to do some crowd control ? [ TWO sighs ] I 'm just going over inventory from the boxes that Five managed to crack . Busy night for her . These , uh , these were a little bit trickier so we 'll probably have to break into them at some point . You okay ? I 've had a lot on my mind . Let 's hear about it . You saw the scans . Yeah , and they said you 're flesh and blood- - Artificially constructed . Like one of those transfer transit clones . [ ONE ] Those only last a few days , they 're not sustainable organisms . And they don 't have minds of their own . Do I ? I mean , I have thoughts and emotions- - anger , sadness , happiness- - but I 'm starting to wonder ... How real are they ? Having been on the receiving end of that anger , I can confirm it 's ... pretty real . [ TWO ] But if every part of me was designed and manufactured , including my brain , then are my thoughts my own , or-or are they just what somebody else wants me to think ? And if so , who is that somebody else ? Who constructed me , and for what purpose ? I 'm sorry , I can 't pretend to understand what you 're going through . But I can tell you this ... It doesn 't change how I feel about you . I just need to process all of this . Sure . If you , uh ... feel like ... talking ? Come find me . [ door beeps ] [ door beeps ] [ SIX ] All right , Raza , we 're en route . [ THREE ] Let 's go bag us a scientist . [ lock beeps ] [ ONE ] All right . If I was a kidnapped scientist , where would I be ? [ THREE ] What the- - ? Like I said : I hate cake . Welcome back , Rebecca . What the hell are- - [ high-pitched squealing ] [ TWO grunts ] What the hell did you do to her ? [ MAN ] I merely rendered her unconscious . I have no intention of hurting her . Now , put your weapons down . Like hell . I will not hurt her , but I have no problem hurting either of you or your friends back on the shuttle . Your progress was monitored from ship to surface . We 've been expecting you . Tabor set us up . [ THREE ] That little prick . [ MAN ] Now , if you will kindly lay down your weapons , we have much to discuss . [ FOUR ] Anger is counterproductive . It 's a natural response , but after a certain point , it becomes toxic . I assume you 're talking about me ? No , I was actually referring to the passive-aggressive empty seat next to you . You can resent us all you like for our decision to deliver the device , but , ultimately , you 're as much at fault as the rest of us . I tried to stop you . Did you ? [ ONE ] Marauder , do you read ? Go ahead , Ground Team . What 's your status ? [ ONE ] It 's complicated . [ SIX ] Care to elaborate ? Well , it looks like we 've been invited to dinner . [ SIX ] Raza , this is the Marauder . Are you there ? [ THE ANDROID ] Yes . Is everything all right ? Negative . It was a set-up . Ground Team 's been taken and we 're told the facility has a lock on our position . If we attempt to fly out , they 'll take us out . [ THE ANDROID ] What should I do ? [ SIX ] Just sit tight for now . We 're gonna go join the others . If you don 't hear from us inside the next four hours , get the hell out of here . [ MAN ] I am so sorry that I 'm late . It 's ... just been one of those days . I 'm sure you can empathize . [ ONE ] Where is she ? She is resting comfortably . I meant what I said earlier . I will never hurt her . In fact , this is my small way of thanking you for keeping her safe and returning her to me . Who the hell are you ? My name is Alexander Rook . I own a company called Dwarf Star Technologies along with all of its subsidiaries , patents , and prototypes , including Rebecca . Although , I believe in your company she is going by Portia ? [ SIX ] I 'm pretty sure you can 't lay legal claim to the results of banned research . Last time I checked , the creation of human facsimiles is against the law . Oh , and what would you have me do ? Put one of those ridiculous tattoos on her neck as if she was some common android ? [ laughs ] No . Although Rebecca 's biological components are superior , she must be constantly monitored and maintained by her nanites . Slow down the nanites , slow down Rebecca . Is that what you did to her ? Yes . I have blanketed this entire facility in a dampening field . At its present lowest setting , it merely renders her harmless . But at higher settings , it will shut her down , and ultimately destroy her . We can 't have her escaping a second time . You know , she was created right here in this facility . She has no memory of it because her consciousness was inert at that point . She was moved to a more appropriate , secure facility for her awakening . Yeah , how 'd that work out ? Not particularly well for the program , or for the 43 scientists and security personnel who lost their lives when she made her escape . We believe that there is a flaw in her neural network that leaves her prone to irrational behavior and outbursts of extreme violence . Listen , you are very lucky . It was only a matter of time before she turned on you , too . So you say . [ ROOK chuckles ] If I actually considered any of you a threat , you would already be dead . Now , come ! Eat ! [ FIVE ] You left her ? ! Didn 't have a choice , kid . Prepare to jump . You left her ? ! They 're gone . Good . Let 's get to work . [ THE ANDROID ] I 've dropped us out in close proximity to the system 's A-type main sequence star . As long as we remain within it 's radiation shadow , we 'll be undetectable by long-range scanners . [ ONE ] But it 's safe , right ? Absolutely not . If you 're going to come up with a plan of action , I suggest you do it quickly . [ ROOK ] Hello , Rebecca . Who the hell are you and what did you do to me ? And why do you keep calling me " Rebecca " ? Because that 's your name . And you are ? It 's Alex . You-You really don 't remember me ? No , I don 't . Where 's my crew ? They 're gone . What do you mean they 're gone ? I mean they left . They got in their shuttle , flew back to their ship , and they jumped . No . They wouldn 't just leave me . [ ROOK ] They didn 't have a choice . For the moment , at least , neither do you . Open this door . Come , sit down . Let 's talk . [ TWO ] Open this door or I 'm going to come over there and break you in half . Your people-breaking days are over , at least for now . [ TWO grunts ] I 'm sorry , but you are no longer special . And as long as this dampening field is active , you are less than normal . I am so sorry , but I can 't have you running off again . What the hell are you talking about ? ! [ ROOK ] What is the last thing you remember about your past ? Waking up out of stasis on a ship . That 's it . Those people you came with , they did something to you . No , those people are my friends , and they 'll be coming back for me . I don 't think so . But if they are stupid enough to try , we 'll be ready for them . [ THREE ] I say we just do what we do best : we head down there , we kill everyone , and we bring her back . As much as I admire your suicidal optimism , there 's no way of knowing how many men or guns they have . Fine . So we 'll lob a couple of orbital strikes their way first to soften ' em up . [ FOUR ] A ship to surface bombardment would be inadvisable unless we knew exactly where she was being held . [ SIX ] Besides , they 'd see us coming and if they have antisatellite capabilities , they 'd tag us before we even got off our first salvo . [ ONE ] Okay , how about taking the Marauder in ? It 's smaller , easier to avoid detection . We can hit them with a couple of precision strikes . Then what ? And then land and storm the place . But at that point we 've lost the element of surprise . [ THREE sighs ] [ SIX ] They 'd cut us to pieces before we got anywhere near that facility , if we made it that far . The second we land , our shuttle becomes a stationary target . [ THE ANDROID ] Then don 't land . Come again ? [ THE ANDROID ] Take the Marauder , but don 't land . There 's another way into that facility . [ door ringing ] [ FIVE ] Uh , hang on . Come in . [ SIX ] Hey . Uh , just wanted you to know , we 're gonna go get her . I knew you weren 't serious about leaving her behind . [ SIX ] The Android 's coming with us , which means someone has to stay to monitor the ship . You just don 't want rne there because you don 't think I 'd be any use . I don 't want you there because Two wouldn 't want you there . [ SIX ] The Android is gonna enter a program into the nav system . If we 're not back inside of four hours , it 'll set an automatic course for the nearest space station . You 'll be on your own . This is unwise . You 're abandoning your obligations to the ship . I 'm fulfilling my duties to the members of its crew by helping to ensure their safety . My actions will in no way compromise this vessel . They will indirectly , if you don 't return . I have every intention of doing so . After careful consideration , I 've come to the conclusion that the benefits of retrieval outweigh the risks . Two is integral to the security of this ship and its crew . She is system-proficient , a capable leader , and ... she is my friend . Friendship implies a mutual affection . You 're not programmed to form emotional attachments . Furthermore , the assumption that she would reciprocate- - The crew has demonstrated a concern for my well-being , sometimes at the risk of their own lives . They engage me as an equal . They are ... nice to me . Humans have an innate tendency to anthropomorphize . The fact that you possess human features no doubt engenders a subconscious confusion . Might I remind you ? You are a machine . A machine with friends . [ TWO ] Back on the ship , I - | knew I was different . I just didn 't know how . Even after I found out , it was just too unbelievable to comprehend . But now , seeing all of this , I ... You should be proud of what you are . Your body can overcome any abnormal biological pathogen . YOU can regenerate . You are faster and stronger . You are superior in every way . So my nanites can cure me and protect me , but ... they don 't prevent me from aging ? No . In the long run , that would raise suspicion , and we just couldn 't risk it . Why not ? You are perfection . You are a living reminder of all of their failings . And they will hate you for it . If the authorities ever found out about you , they would use all their power to hunt you down and kill you . But you 're safe now . You are safe with me . And I promise you , I will never let anything happen to you . Why was I created ? The answer to that question is part of a much bigger conversation . And one that we will have ... in due time . [ SIX ] Okay ! [ alarm sounds ] What 's happening ? [ SCIENTIST ] They came back . They buzzed the facility to test our perimeter defenses , but they 're gone now . You think she made it ? Let 's hope so . She 's our only shot at pulling this off . What are we looking for ? Defect that might explain a few things . Such as ? Your aberrant behavior . H-Have you found anything ? [ SCIENTIST ] No . Your results show your brain functioning normally . I expected your scans would reveal psychopathic tendencies in the cerebral cortex related to empathy , but it doesn 't seem to be the case . Well , are you sure you 're getting the right readings- - I 'm sorry , this- - It 's moving all over the place . [ SCIENTIST ] Don 't touch it ! I told Alex you needed to be restrained but he was insistent . I can 't hurt you anymore . Of course not . [ TWO ] Then why do you have a problem with me ? Were you working at the facility when I escaped ? No , but many of my former colleagues were . I was to be involved in Phase Three , but we never got there . You saw to that . I 'm sorry . Are you ? Do you feel remorse ? According to your scan , it 's physiologically possible , but I can 't help but have my doubts given the digital evidence recorded at the scene . Your actions were quite calculated and devoid of emotion . I-I can 't remember . [ SCIENTIST ] How fortunate for you . I wish I could forget the images I 've seen . You may have him fooled , but I don 't believe it for a second . Your time will come , and when it does , I look forward to dissecting your brain for a closer , more intimate analysis . Okay , approaching the facility . Running a scan . And ? [ SIX ] Nothing . No unusual radiation signatures . What 's taking her so long ? It 's not like she 's just gonna stroll in there and get it done . She has to quietly enter the facility without alerting anyone . [ screams ] [ grunting ] [ SIX ] Then , she has to trace the dampening field to its source . Who knows how it 's laid out down there . Could be a maze . There 's no telling where they 're holding Two . Told you she couldn 't be trusted . Rebecca , you disappoint me again . Let go of me ! I swear I 'll kill you ! Every last one of you ! [ TWO grunts ] I tested you and you failed . I 'm sorry but we 're going to have to start over . Maybe this is for the best . We 'll be able to do a complete analysis and gain a more full understanding of where we went wrong , so the next brain we give you is free of imperfections . Goodbye , Rebecca . Wait . Wait ! Wait ! I could grant you the mercy of shutting you down before the surgery , but I think this is a wonderful time to test your pain receptors . Okay , coming in for another approach . Running a scan . Still nothing . Oh , come on ! How long does it take to blow some shit up ? ! It 's not like it 's rocket science . Maybe the field emitter was harder to find than she thought . [ FOUR ] Could it be possible that it 's affecting her as well ? [ saw buzzing ] No . No ! Something 's gone wrong . We 've gotta get down there . Can 't . We set the shuttle down , we 're a sitting target . So set the shuttle down out of range . What ? You think you 're going to cover that distance on foot ? Well , we 've gotta do something . Come around for another pass . [ sighs ] Your regenerative abilities have been severely compromised . [ saw buzzing ] [ grunts ] [ TWO ] This is a great opportunity to test your pain receptors . [ SCIENTIST grunting ] [ SCIENTIST ] Help me ! - - [ SCIENTIST screams ] - - [ shrieking ] [ buzzing ] [ screaming , yelling ] [ GUARD ] Hey ! [ grunts ] The Marauder is awaiting my signal . Would you like to help me blow something up ? Would I ! All right , coming up on the facility . Running another scan . Okay , I 've got an explosion- - Multiple explosions ! Whoa ! [ FIVE ] I knew you 'd be back ! Worried we wouldn 't make it in time ? Nah . I deleted the nav command you guys entered , just in case . What if we hadn 't come back ? Then I would 've programmed a new one . I didn 't know you knew how to program . Neither did I. [ water splattering ] - - [ THREE ] Come on , seriously ! - - [ SIX laughs ] You just send me out there , man , I am ready . Once around the ship , no problem . Yeah , more like once around and into the side of the ship . - - [ THREE ] Hey , hey , hey , hey . - - [ ALL laughing ] [ SIX ] Trusting you to fly that shuttle is like betting on him in a fight . [ SIX laughs ] No offense ! [ ALL laughing ] [ FOUR ] He just needs proper training . [ SIX ] Are you offering ? [ FOUR ] Absolutely not , I already have a student . [ FIVE ] He 's gonna teach me to kick all of your asses . [ THREE ] Ooohhh . [ TWO ] Hey . Um , I wanted to thank you guys , all of you . You risked your lives to save me and I really appreciate it . Well , we just figured that if we didn 't , and you somehow managed to escape on your own , you 'd come back here , you 'd never let us hear the end of it . Never , but you 're probably right . [ ALL laughing ] [ FOUR ] Come , sit . Pour that woman a drink . Come on . [ SIX ] Pour that woman a drink , someone ? - - [ THREE ] Here you go . - - [ TWO ] Thank you . [ SIX ] Cheers , guys . - -Cheers . - -Cheers . [ PORTIA ] So ... [ RYO ] You were right . [ PORTIA ] Then we 're agreed ? [ RYO ] Yes . [ PORTIA ] He has to die . [ RYO ] When ? [ PORTIA ] Before we get to the mining colony , after we come out of stasis . [ monitor beeps ] [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] Where is she ? She 's gone . She escaped . She had help . [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] How old is this body ? It 's 24 . [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] You see what happens . [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] Would you like to be next ? That won 't be necessary . We 've nearly completed work on the new prototype . [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] And what are you going to do about the other one ? We don 't need her anymore . [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] Her continued existence threatens ours . You say she has friends who assisted her ? Yes . [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] Do they know what she is ? Yes . [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] Then they 'll need to die too , Alex . [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] All of them . Yes . [ door clicks ] Hello .

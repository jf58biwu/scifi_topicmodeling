 Previously on " Falling Water " ... Yeah , I saw your patient out in the woods with a bunch of those green-sneaker people . Alice is not some gentle , little girl . Our Belgian client has concerns . But he 's also unloading his nine-figure holdings . Step out of the way . Who is he ? He was my silent partner . I thought we weren 't seeing each other ? We 're not . I 'm not even here . - What are they ? - Forget-me-nots . Help me , and I will help you find your son . What now ? Now you lie down and go to sleep . - Your man was there , Andy . - Andy ? Don 't tell Bill . A half-hearted poem : " I once met a woman who wasn 't there . " She was long and tall and slim and fair . " I love this woman with all my heart . " And when she vanished , it tore me apart . " " I once met a woman who wasn 't there . " " I followed her down " to the pit of despair . " She was not evil , " she was kind . " It was not her , but me ... " " Who was blind . " Men . How are you , Andy ? You look in a hurry . Are you in a hurry ? Always . That 's why you never get anywhere . Things take time . Patience , practice . I hear you 're working with Bill Boerg . Not anymore . You don 't have to worry . Andy , I 've worried about you every minute since you 've scuttled off into the dark three years ago . Now I need you . You 're family , and family is forever . Why ? The boy 's been taken . Hey , Tess , it 's B. He doesn 't want you to know , but ... Javier 's in the hospital . It 's not good . Pájaro . How are you , amor ? How do I look ? Handsome . Thank goodness love is blind . How about you ? How are your wings ? Come on , let me see , turn around . - Javi ... - Turn . Yes . Must have taken a lot to get you off the boat . If I knew all they were gonna tell me is that I 'm dying , I would have jumped into the Aegean while I still could . I 'm glad you didn 't . So , how much for your secrets ? A drachma . I will give you ten . You already know too many . I always knew I couldn 't keep you . What ? What is it ? Been having powerful dreams again . Again ? When did you stop ? Javi , I 'm serious ... So am I. You talk like your dreams are a curse . How I wish I could dream like you . It is a privilege to dream . None of us can do it forever . Excuse me , Mr. Mendoza , we need to ... We just need a moment . They have come to make it possible for me to piss . If you don 't mind , I don 't want the last memory you have of my penis attached to a catheter . Okay . I wanted to apologize for the other night . Alice ... her parents confirmed what you told me , that she 's been sneaking out . I like this girl . She 's ... reachable , but I 'm not reaching her . And I thought if you told me more about your experience in the woods , it might give me some insight . Let me talk to her . She 'll barely talk to me . She won 't talk to me , not about her friends in the green sneakers . Well , then she 'll probably stonewall me too . So where 's the risk ? I 'll ask . What are you writing ? What do you care ? You don 't even want to be here . Where are you going ? I have a date . No , you don 't . It 's what you want me to do . Validate the little pocket of paranoia in your head . Why are you doing this ? I don 't want to do this . Then be here . Stay here . Accept this as the time we have . See , even when you 're here , you 're not here . Because this is a dream . I need more than just dreams . Why ? Tell me about the pub . That 's not fair . Blonde wood . Brass fixtures . A jackalope above the bar . You were wearing a green skirt . You were on your second pint . You asked me my favorite book . I wrote my number on your business card . Stop it . I swore I wasn 't going to kiss you . You can 't keep doing this . I swore I wasn 't going to kiss you . I swore I wasn 't going to kiss you . Then you did . You hungry ? I always eat them two at a time in a three-to-two ratio . Perfect balance . The only problem is the extra cookie . Sure you don 't want ? Those 'll kill you . Almost everything in this life will . I almost broke my neck chasing you through those woods . I 'm sorry if I disturbed the ritual . I just ... I really wanted to understand . Can you help me understand ? I 'm the one who found them . They were lying in a circle . Their heads together . Such an odd way to die . Not like eating an ice cream sundae , somebody sneaking up behind you , pulling a bag over your head . That 's a whole different kind of death . Your friends in the house , that was something sacred . Cops I work with think they were deluded , but I know they 're wrong . Problem is I can 't explain why they 're wrong . Who cares ? The police don 't matter . Who does ? Ann-Marie Bowen ? The other Ann-Marie Bowen ? Does Trey Walker matter ? He was one of the dead bodies , an older boy . He lived across the street from you . I 'm not talking about Trey . Your parents told me you used to have dreams about him . That 's a lie . Said you wrote about it in your diary . I was a stupid little girl . - Trey ... - Can 't speak for himself anymore . He needs you . He needs you to explain why what he did was so important . It was . Worth his life ? He wasn 't supposed to die . What was supposed to happen ? Protection . They were betrayed . By who ? Fat men who eat too much ice cream . What were they protecting ? I 'm not talking about that . - Was it Topeka ? - Shut your mouth . Tell me about Topeka . Why was it backwards on the wall ? - I said shut up ! - Alice , stop . You 're a blind sheep . Your face is buried in the mud . Blind sheep get slaughtered . Today 's exercise : You 're the lead . Your job 's to collect the other dreamers and bring them back to the chairs one-by-one . We 're giving you a promotion . Thanks . Dreamers , look this way . Look at the others . Take in their faces . Then go find them . Lie down , please . Can you hear the music ? I 'm not allowed to change the channel . It 's recording . You 're a very smart girl . Come on . Go . Find him . There you are . Welcome back . Something went wrong . Faceless man ? The man in that bed ... He 's fine . We were attacked . Tess . He 's fine , I promise . It 's you we 're worried about . You were out for hours . He 's really fine ? When you die in your dreams , you don 't actually die . That 's a myth . That 's how the whole Andy stroke rumor got started . Tess , I know this is difficult , but we 're doing groundbreaking work . This gets to the heart of who we are . I 'm just glad you 're okay . Can you see me ? Yes . Can you see me now ? Just your legs . That 's enough . Can you feel it ? Yes . Open your eyes . Look at me . Here you go . What are they selling ? Forget-me-nots . Come out , come out , wherever you are . Forget-me-not ? How much ? I knew I knew that voice . Get out of my life . Thought you wanted to get tight . Not anymore . Can 't even be friends ? Now that I 've had my hand down your pants ? You know , I had a good thing before you had Bill kick me out of the study . I was ... I was embedded . Yeah , like a tick on a dog . Who 's the kid in the flyer ? Why was that flyer so special that you lost your mind ? - Get out of my way ! - God , you are selfish . You 're like ... You 're like Goldilocks , when you stumble in the bears ' house , you eat all their food ... You break their chairs , you sleep in their beds . And then you scream when they catch you , like you 're the victim . But here 's the thing . About Goldilocks ? In the end ? The bears ate her . And nobody noticed . Because nobody cared . She was a self-centered bitch , alone in the world . And nobody missed her when she was gone . I don 't have to do a damn thing to you . World 's full of monsters . One of ' em will swallow you up soon enough . On your way , Goldilocks . On your way ! What are you writing ? We 're going in circles . I have a date . I 'm not doing this again . It 's what we do . Hello , darling . Just passing by ? Who 's back there ? I 'm not the nosy type . You 're not supposed to be here . - The restaurant 's closed . - Who 's the boy ? - This isn 't for you . - You have to go . What are you trying to hide ? Leave ! This is Burton . Where 's the fire ? Our paranoid Belgian client . Fallout from Montreal . Seven days ago this was an easy closing on a nine-figure deal . Now it 's a tire fire . The Belgian doesn 't want to sell to white sand anymore . He wants new buyers , multiple buyers , and he wants to be in active negotiations this week or he 'll take his business across the street . Talk him out of it . Walk him back . Cow 's already out of the barn . It 's my fault . No , you don 't get to take a bullet . You were security and you were the senior hand on deck . You should 've been watching him . We 'll find another buyer . In a week ? I had to guarantee the Belgian a goddamn floor price . Sounds like we don 't have a choice . Well , with time , we could use this to our advantage , play buyers off of each other . We still can . We just have to get them all in one place , put a clock on them . We do it out of our office . Treat it like an auction . It 's already Monday in the far east . I could get on the horn and start making phone calls . We 'll need travel , security , office space for everyone we can lure into town . Whatever his prospects need , you get , even if it 's a half dozen corn-fed virgins . As we hone in on a buyer , I 'll need help vetting their cash reserves . Shouldn 't be hard . It 'll be goddamn arcane , but it 's find a buyer or cancel Christmas . Can I help you ? - Can I have a dozen biscotti ? - Sure . Double cap up . Long way to come for biscotti . There 's a ... A farmers ' market that I like not far from here . It has this lady who sells pupusas . Yeah , Mrs. Flores . She 's good . Here I thought she was my little secret . You want a secret ? Try Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen , the Vietnamese couple two stalls down . Their mushrooms will change your life . Life-changing mushrooms ? No , not quite as life changing as the pinoles here . You 've had the pinoles ? Just the biscotti . Hey , Maria ? Can I get a pinole ? - Here you go . - Thank you . Here . Now , if that 's not the best pinole in the city , I 'll buy you a dozen pupusas . So ? I guess I 'll have to try the mushrooms . Well , can I introduce you to the Nguyens ? That 'd be nice . You can 't go . Why not ? Because if I got eaten by bears , you 'd actually care . Tess , don 't do that . Stay . I wish I could . I wish I could have one last dance . I can do that . I can . Close your eyes and trust me . I 'll be there . How much for all your secrets ? Pájaro . Come . The tide is going out . I should get back to the boat . We still have time . I 'm so tired . But I 'm scared to go . I 'll stay here as long as you do . Yeah , exactly . Yeah , that is our hope too . Yeah , well , if , if that works for you . Yes . Great . So our head of security will be at the hotel to meet your people when ... when they arrive . Yeah . You too . Okay . Yeah . Thank you . We have our first swimmer in the pool . Congratulations . Mr. Song from Malaysia . His top aide was already in Vancouver so it was just a hop , a skip , and a jump . I was thinking we should get some food . Yeah , I could eat . How about Marcello 's ? Marcello 's ? Do they deliver ? If you ask nicely . Yeah , sure , why not ? Only shame is we can 't put it on Hull 's credit card . You could call Mrs. Hull , ask for the number . Yeah , I don 't want to drag her into this . She 's a nice lady , even if she is a bit nuts . Maybe it 's the company she keeps . Well , that 's true for all of us . There are sirens everywhere , just waiting to drag us into the well . Mr. Song 's people , 6 : 00 AM at the hotel . Hey . Yeah . You ... you have Japan ? Okay , great . Yeah , no , I 'll hold . I didn 't expect to spend my day like this . Is it over ? There 's a crepe place around the corner . We could maybe go there sometime . On a date ? I don 't date . I don 't want to be alone either , but ... I 'm too old for the ritual . I know who I am and that 's not changing . Things happen to you , you become particular . And you have to be honest about it . Right , I get it . Taka . Come inside . Stand here . Can you see me ? Yes . Promise you won 't move ? I won 't move . So are you coming or going ? I have a date . I love you . It doesn 't matter . I conjured you . This is what we have . It 's not enough . Without you , I 'm lost in the dark . It 's not enough . I won 't go . Please don 't do this . You need me . I 'll be fine . No . You won 't . And I won 't either . Go . Away . I once met a woman who wasn 't there . I followed her down to the pit of despair . She was not evil , she was kind . It was not her , but me , who was blind . So nice of you to meet me .

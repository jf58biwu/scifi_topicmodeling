 Four weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons ... rage ... grief ... fear . My God . Now , in order to survive , we must battle our most dangerous adversary ... the enemy within . You saved me from becoming one of them . I knew the real you was still in there . The dome 's surface is calcifying , unless I can bring down the dome with Joe 's help . I have to stay and build this device . It 's the only way out of here . Everything has a cycle , and mine is coming to an end . - Who the hell are you ? ! - Hektor Martin . He runs Aktaion . I 'm gonna do whatever it takes to make sure that this dome never comes down . You 're a threat to Eva 's baby , Julia . Gua ... ! No one saw us , right ? I don 't think so . Easy . Here . What the hell were you thinking , sneaking off like that ? You 're not my dad . I can do what I want . Oh , sass ? Now we get sass ? Look , your actions affect all of us . You could 've led those freaks straight here to us . Which she didn 't , okay ? She saved my life , so take it easy . We 've got bigger problems , anyway . Oh , you mean Barbie ? Did his little side piece , lure him back to alien town ? No , but their baby is gonna be here sooner than we thought . Norrie and I just saw her . She looks almost full-term . And I 'm pretty sure 12 girls just died to make it the world 's shortest pregnancy . Well , then , we got to kill her . We got to put her down before that thing comes out . Why is that your solution to everything ? Killing the problem . I 'm sure you like stepping on spiders too . Well , if the spider has a queen baby inside that 's gonna wipe out the entire human race , that kind of spider , yeah , I think I 'd kill it . This cure of yours , you really think it 'll work ? You said you didn 't need it . I believe you said love was the answer . And now I 'm admitting that might not be enough . Glad to hear it . Dr. Bloom has already synthesized a base formula . All we need now is a specimen of Christine Price 's DNA . You 'll need a test subject to try it on , right ? I can be your lab monkey . Well , that 's very generous of you ... but it 's necessary to have a subject in whom the infection is full-blown . I have a question . Joe , he 's working on this thing to bring the dome down ... what if he finishes it before you can get this cure to work ? What if they get out ? Well , then we have a bunch of creepy-crawlies , that can have babies in three days , going forth and prospering . That 's not gonna happen . I told you I 'd get you Christine Price 's DNA ... I 'll get it . Christine was at the barn with Eva . Better to go there than Town Hall ... I 'll go with you . - Jim . - Yeah . It 's our last chance . All right , nice and easy . Lay down , rest . Are you ready ? For what ? The new queen . Of course . Get some sleep . You all right ? Fine . I just stood up too fast . How is Joe 's work progressing ? He was initially resistant , but he 's come around . He moved into a larger room , and he 's made a few breakthroughs . But ... he 's still in the planning stage . We 're running out of time . The dome is dying . If we don 't get out before it does ... I can make him work faster . No . No violence . He 's too valuable . I 'll handle him . - Have you seen Junior ? - I haven 't . But anything you need , I can take care of . Joe will need our last remaining amethyst to continue his work . I 'll find a way to get it up to him safely . You 've come a long way , Sam . I 'm pleased . Barbie , how 's Eva ? She 's resting , comfortably . Good . The baby should be here within the day . I 'd like to go after what 's left of the Resistance . No need . Our primary concerns , right now , are here , under this roof : the birth of the new queen and the building of the device . They still pose a threat . Are you worried about your daughter , Barbie ? No . Only the kinship . Inside Eva is the queen who will lead our kinship out of the dome . Nothing is more important than that . Your priority is to be by Eva 's side until that baby is born . I understand . There 's aliens outside the dome now , too . Not aliens , plural , like the James Cameron sequel ; alien , singular , like the Ridley Scott original . Pretty sure this is an isolated incident . I don 't even know what I 'm looking at here . That 's Lily 's dad , or what used to be . Okay . And ... ? She doesn 't know ; she thinks he 's dead , but he 's not ... he 's in some Aktaion containment unit in Zenith . Well , does that Hektor guy know ? He 's got to , right ? I-I mean , he 's the one who told Lily to destroy these files . - We should tell her . - Wait , wait , wait . Just telling her out of the blue , it could mess her up . And Hektor ... maybe he 's got a reason for keeping this on the down low . Seriously ? You 're defending him ? No , I 'm just saying maybe we run it by Julia before we do anything . Are you okay ? Yeah . Why ? I don 't know , what Julia said before , that you saved her . What happened out there ? Nothing , I 'm fine . Hey , there you are . Check this out . Okay , so you know the whistling the town 's been doing ? The amethyst responds to it . - That 's great , Joe . - The strange thing is : it only actually responds when you 're whistling to it . Look , look . Okay , it lights up , yeah ? Okay , now watch . It doesn 't respond to a recording . - Okay , that 's-that 's fascinating . - But how does it know that ? - I mean , it 's got to detect a ... - Okay , Joe , Joe . Slow down . I need to know how soon until this thing is working . I don 't know , I-I have a couple big problems to figure out . A day or two ? I need you to stall . What ? No , I-I thought the dome needed to come down before we choked to death . It-it does , but the Resistance is working on a cure . We have to see if it 'll work before your device does . Otherwise we unleash the kinship on the rest of the world . Okay . I 'll-I 'll try my best . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna try and save Eva . The Eva I used to know . Barbie , be careful . These aliens , you got 'em tricked for now , but at some point , they 'll find out you 're you . Found a sample of Christine 's hair . Good . So the last time you saw Barbie was here at the barn , he was walking away with Miss , Barefoot and Ready-to-Pop ? You sure he 's still playing for the home team ? Look , the only reason that he 's with her now is ' cause he cares about what happens to his baby . Oh , I see . Just yesterday , you were all , " Love conquers all . " And now you 're , like , " Rah , rah , cure " ? There 's more to it than that . Barbie says the dome is calcifying . Pretty soon , there won 't be any air to breathe . Does Hektor know about this ? - I don 't think so . - Well ... if we 're all gonna suffocate , what 's the point of a cure ? If the cure works , and Joe figures out how to take down the dome , maybe we can all get out of here the same way we came in . Oh , human , you mean ? Kill them . Hey , don 't shoot ! Stop ! Don 't shoot my son ! I think we just found our test subject . 3x11 - Love is a Battlefield How long will it take for the cure to be ready ? Not long at all , providing you stop hovering and let me extract the DNA from this hair . That too tight for you ? Wait , scratch that . I don 't care . You will later . We 're gonna fix you , kid . I 've already been fixed . In the cocoons . They made me better . No , they didn 't . They ... they made you into something I don 't recognize . 'Cause you 're too shortsighted to comprehend it . All I am is what the kinship needs me to be , what this world needs me to be . Junior , that sounds like ... helter skelter to me . You don 't know what 's coming . You better hope this cure doesn 't work . Why ? Because when the dome comes down , you 'll need the kinship to survive . Survive what ? Can I show you something ? Julia ... this is important . Enjoying yourself ? Yeah , it was all there was to listen to . Listening to music instead of working on our special little project ? I was thinking , I 'm not like one of your drones . I can 't just work until I drop . Sometimes I got to stop thinking in order to think . Besides , I-I hit a problem . The original plan was to have the amethyst conduct the tones into the egg , which would act as a key , signaling the dome to unlock . Of course , that requires seven amethysts and the egg , both of which Big Jim destroyed . So we don 't have enough amethysts , and we don 't have a way to transmit a signal to the dome ? Those are some big problems . Come on , Joe ... I know you better than that . I know you find the problem exciting . First things first . We need to split the amethyst into seven pieces . How ? I have no idea . Come with me . There 's something you need to see . How are you ? I 'm tired . And weak . How are you feeling ? I just told you I was tired . No , I mean about the girls in the barn ... and the sacrifice that they made . They did their duty . Just like I 'm doing mine , being a vessel for the new queen . You remember how badly you wanted to have a baby ? How affected you were when you found out you weren 't pregnant ? I remember . But that Eva 's gone . It doesn 't matter what I want . All that matters is what 's best for the group . This isn 't our child . This child belongs to the kinship . This was Patrick four days ago ? According to the time stamp , yeah . So he 's lying . It 's ready to go . You are not using this . What 's going on here ? I was about to ask the same thing . What aren 't you telling us about Patrick Walters ? About my father ? He 's still alive . No . That 's not possible . He 's dead . You told me he 's dead . He 's not dead , sweetheart , but he is gone . What does that even mean ? I think you should have Hunter show you the video . I 'd like to know what video you 're referring to . I 'm sure you would , but I 'm asking the questions now . So before you stick this in Junior , why don 't you tell us what really happened to your good friend Patrick . The only reason I kept Patrick 's condition a secret was for Lily 's sake . I didn 't want to hurt her . Condition ? He turned into something else , something other . A kind of energy infused with consciousness , but it wasn 't his . It was their consciousness . All right , so your main man Marston , he was working on a cure to save your friend ... but it didn 't work ? Well , so who 's to say this stuff won 't do the same thing to my son ? I 'll be honest , Jim ... it could . But I believe it will work . The advances we 've made since Patrick was lost , the opportunities we had to derive a pure strain from Christine , this is the best shot at treatment that we 've ever had . We have the briefest of windows to save this town . Like you said , Julia , to get the infection out of Hunter , Norrie , Barbie ... if the cure succeeds ... out of my friend as well . It 's up to you , Jim . He 's your son , not mine . It could kill him . There 's a risk , of course . But if we don 't try ... there certainly won 't be a reward . Do it . Where are we going ? If this is about the dome calcifying , I already know . I need your cooperation . Cooperation . Seems to me you 've only asked for my submission . Oh , I see . You still think we want to be here . That we wanted to travel hundreds of thousands of light-years through a cold , harsh vacuum , that we wanted to leave our home , our history behind . Earth is a wonderful place , but it 's not that great . Why are you here ? Because we had no choice . And now , neither do you . Right now , somewhere , up in the sky , they 're coming . Who ? Listen to me , Joe . Listen very carefully . They destroyed our world , and they 'll destroy yours . This isn 't just about the survival of the kinship . It 's about humanity 's survival , too . Whether you want to recognize it or not , our fates are tied together . And the only way we stand a chance is for us to get out of this dome . That rests entirely in your hands . My poor father . I failed him . I never should 've given up . No , Lily , this is not your fault . Okay ? This one 's on Hektor . He 's been like a second father to me . How am I supposed to trust him now ? Look , I don 't know him , and I 'm not usually the type to make excuses for corporate billionaire overlords , but maybe he had good intentions . I 'm just saying Hektor can 't be all bad . He came in here to help us , right ? Get us secure and get this dome down . Right , Lily ? Of course . Of course that 's what he 's doing . I 'm sorry , I just need time to process all this . Come on , kiddo . You got to fight through it . This cure of yours is burning him up . Be patient , Jim ; it 's a good sign . 106-degree fever is a good sign ? What , do you think brain damage is a good thing , too ? The fact that he 's running a high fever means that his body is responding properly to the virus . Just ... just give it time , okay ? Excuse me . I don 't know what to do . Lily ? I was just trying to protect you . - From my father ? - Not from him . From what he became . I don 't want your memory of Patrick to be corrupted . That wasn 't your decision to make . I know it wasn 't , and I 'm sorry . I just thought if I could find a cure , I could return him whole to you , the man you knew . Everything that I 've done since it happened has been toward that end . I didn 't tell you he was alive because I didn 't want to give you false hope . I 've got to ask : How did they get the video ? I sent the files through . I told you to destroy them . I know . The reason why the government wants us dead is in those files . If the truth got out about what 's really under this dome , there 'd be a situation that they couldn 't control . Easier to bury the evidence and hide the bodies . That 's why we can 't ever leave , Lily . No . This information about my father , it changes everything . Especially if the cure works . - Lily ... - Shut up and listen to me . Say it works , and you save all these people . And say what Jim told you is true , that there is a way out of the dome . You could walk out of here a hero . The government couldn 't touch you . And those files ? Just an insurance policy . I need to see my father again . You owe that to me . All right , Lily . If the cure works , I 'll ... I 'll get us out . Eva ? What 's wrong ? You in pain ? No . No pain at all . Good . Here you go . What ? Nothing . Eva ... what is it ? Talk to me . It 's just ... all of this is happening so fast . I 'm not sure I 'm ready . I mean , what if I let the kinship ... or you ... down ? Why would you think that ? There is nothing you can 't tell me . My earliest memory ... I couldn 't have been more than four ... is of blood . A drop of blood on a shattered piece of my mother 's family china . She 'd thrown it at my dad . I don 't even know what they were arguing about ... but I 'll never forget that drop of blood . A broken piece of him on a broken piece of her . Not long after that , my parents and I , we spent a summer in a mountain cabin outside of Salt Lake City . And it was just the three of us , and the woods and the birds ... And ... and ... that was the happiest time of my life . And then we came back to the real world . My parents were divorced within a year . I don 't want that for our baby . I want the cabin . And I want the three of us to be together forever . You can have that , Eva . What are you talking about ? I am talking about getting out of here . About running away . I-I don 't know how ... we 'll figure that out . But just you and me , our baby ... I knew it . I knew you weren 't one of us . Julia is still alive , isn 't she ? I bet she 's ... What did you put in the tea ? I had to , Eva . I 'm not gonna let you hurt my baby . Have you made up your mind ? Are you going to help us take down the dome ? I don 't really have a choice , do I ? Neither of us do . The real trick 'll be doing the calculations necessary to split the amethyst into seven pieces . Are you okay ? In truth ... I 'm dying . My cycle 's coming to an end . Just as it must . My work is almost done . As soon as the dome comes down ... Well , I 'll work as fast as I can . How 's it looking ? Promising . Very promising . Dad ... Where are we ? You 're in a safe place . How you feel ? Like I 'm on fire . But ... I 'm awake . What do you remember ? All of it . Thanks for not giving up on me . You went through the wringer , kid . A lot tougher than I gave you credit for . I 'm gonna promise you something right now . When this dome comes down ... and it will come down ... everything 's gonna be different . You and me , we 're gonna start over , just the two of us . Maybe we can work together at the lot . " Rennie and Son " " How does that sound ? Sounds good . Except for the used cars part . Does it have to be used cars ? Nah , it can be whatever you like . Important thing ... is that it 's you and me . These ... these restraints too tight ? No . That 's okay . I get why they 're there . All right . I 'll see if I can , wrangle up some pop . Wanted to give this back . I was wondering where that went . Nah , keep it . I got plenty . Something else ? What did it feel like ... when you first killed somebody ? It gets easier the more you do it . As far as I recall , I never bagged anyone who didn 't bear some responsibility for the getting killed part . Why ? You feeling guilty ? Well , that 's the thing . I don 't . I don 't feel anything at all . Of course Junior 's not here when all the heavy lifting needs to be done . I haven 't seen him all day . Me , neither . Not since last night . Last night ? Look , I 've probably said too much already , especially considering Junior outranks me . I do , too . So what were you doing last night ? Junior doesn 't trust Barbie , so we went to Peter Shumway 's cabin . I 'm sorry to disturb you , but ... we have a problem . Julia ? You there ? Hey , I 'm here . Hey , I 've got Eva . I couldn 't save her . I tried to , but ... but it didn 't work . What are you gonna do now ? I 'm going to stay with her till she gives birth . I couldn 't save Eva , but at least I can save my child . Come meet us . We 're at the ... No , no , no , no . What ? - Don 't . - He 's not one of them . And what if he is ? He might be trying to get you to reveal our location . Julia ? Are you there ? Yeah , I think she 's going into labor . The motel . Meet me there . All right . Hurry ! They won 't give that baby up without a fight . - Hey . - Where 's Barbie and Eva ? They 're nowhere to be found . And the car 's missing , as well . Organize the town . Everyone . Fan out and find them . Now ! Let 's go . That should be it . You want me to drill these ? Yeah . Four inches deep . Was something unclear ? No , it 's just ... this is our last amethyst . If you 're wrong ... I 'm not . Start drilling . Take me back . No . Lay down . You 're not going anywhere . Sit on up . I knew she wasn 't dead , you coward ! Anybody follow you ? No , but it 'll only be a matter of time before they find us . We just have to hope that baby comes first . I 'm gonna say something you don 't want to hear . We should leave . No , Julia . No way . I know this is hard . But the kinship 's not gonna stop until they have their queen . That baby is half mine . As long as there 's even a chance that she is more me than them , I 'm not gonna abandon her . I can 't . Well , we 're about to find out if you 're right . Sorry for barking at you before . No need apologize . I can 't imagine what it 's like watching your child go through that . Yeah , anyway , I ... I wanted to thank you for giving me back my son . Well ... don 't thank me yet . Why ? It worked . He 's himself again . I actually was gonna ask you if we could lose the restraints . Jim ... the signs look good . But we have to continue monitoring him for the time being . All right . When will the cure be ready for the rest of the town ? When I say it 's ready . Shouldn 't have baby been here by now ? I don 't know . I don 't know why ... Unless ... You hoping you can hold off until Christine finds you ? Get away from me , bitch . I can 't believe I 'm gonna do this . I 'm helping you deliver your baby with another woman . I know . Eva , you need to push . No . Push now ! No ! No ! All right . Okay , keep going . Julia ! - Damn it . - The baby ! Here it comes . Okay , okay . I know , I know . Hey , it 's Daddy . Yeah . One last step . You sure this is going to work ? Only one way to find out . Here you go . Oh , this is ridiculous . It 's okay . No , it 's not . It 's not okay . You do not need to be tied up like an animal . Thanks , Dad . But you shouldn 't have done that . That 's cute . Too tight for you ? Wait , scratch that . I don 't care . It 's time to go . Hey , let me hold her . Dale ... look at me . If you 're gonna take her away from me forever , let me hold her . Just once . She needs to be fed . Please , Dale . It 's up to you . Barbie , we 've got company . Get the baby . Eva ? Give her to me now . She 's not yours . She is my queen . Barbie ! Barbie ... Oh , my God . You okay ? Can you get up ? Come on . Come on . We gotta go . I 'm not leaving my daughter . Whatever that thing is , it is not your daughter ! Barbie , if we stay here , we die . Come on . So much for your miracle cure . Whatever 's inside him is mutating too quickly to target and eliminate . It 's like ... it 's smarter than the treatment . And I know this can work , given the time , I ... Except we 're out of time . Listen to me , Jim . We don 't have a choice . We have to kill them all . Everyone that 's carrying the infection . Including the dormant ones : Hunter , Norrie , Joe , Barbie , everyone . It 's the only way to make sure that the Life Force never gets outside of this dome . Are you all right with that ? Sure . What is it , Lily ? Give us some privacy . I 'm so proud of you . Look at what a good job you 've done . She 's taking what she needs . What 's happening ? Where am I ? Is that my baby ? What are you doing with my baby ? She 's not your baby . And you 're no longer one of us . ♪ Lullaby and good night ♪ ♪ Thy mother 's delight ♪ ♪ Bright angel beside ♪ ♪ My darling abide ♪ ♪ Lay thee down now and rest ♪ ♪ May thy slumber be blessed ♪ ♪ Lay thee down now and rest ♪ ♪ May thy slumber be blessed ... ♪ ♪ With roses bedight thee ♪ ♪ With lilies over spread ♪ ♪ This baby 's wee bed ♪ ♪ Lay thee down now and rest ♪ ♪ May thy slumber be blessed ... ♪

 We 're husband and wife . You can share your secrets now . I 'm not who you think I am . Mark 's gone dark . If he 's off task , just bring him home . The island of Dr. Moreau . Yeah , it was gift from professor Duncan . This could be his key . We would like to buy your business . What makes you think you have the stones for this line of work ? Duncan had tissue samples of the Castor original . You think that if you find them first , you can trade Helena for ' em ? It 's just junk ! There 's no test tubes , no slides ? You 're not gonna believe this . The boy clones are our brothers . What did you tell her ? I 'm your sister , Mark . I made a mistake . Mark , he ... He took advantage of you . Please . Oh , my god . You 're alive . Get away from me . Mark , you should be quiet . Quiet . I 'm gonna help you . She 's coming back . ... quiet . Quiet . ... oh , my god . Oh , my god . Okay , put your hand over it . - Keep pressing . - You need to tie it off . Do you have a belt ? Yes . Here . Why are you helping me ? ... quiet . Oh , Jesus christ . What 's going on ? - He 's in the corn . - All right . - Go get him . - You got it . Shit . We have to go . Come on . We have to get going . This isn 't your fault . I know you don 't trust me , but I 'm all you 've got . ¶ Nearer , my god to thee ¶ nearer to thee ¶ e 'en though it be a cross ¶ that raiseth me ¶ Oh , shit , that 's ... - Oh , my gosh . It is . - I know . Gracie has arrived . Welcome home . Gracie , this is Mr. Appleyard . He was kind enough To take me and the others in after the fire . Ooh ! Little Gracie . Oh , my . You 've grown into a pretty thing , haven 't you ? Jonah was there when you were born . He helped bring you into this world . You had more to say then . And now I understand You 're the one with the blessed child . Amen . Amen . Well , let 's ... Let 's get you to the kitchen . A mother-to-be needs to eat . Hey , keep it down . Step aside . She 's bleeding , sergeant Miller . - Ugh . - My shit . Even in my shit ... - Okay , go in . - Yes , sir . Time for my lab report . She bashed her head against the bars this time . I have to get her over to the infirmary . Helena , it breaks My heart to see you hurt yourself like this . You know how this goes . Keep still , if you don 't want it to hurt . I just don 't think Sarah should be engaging with these people . Well , a , they have Helena , And b , if their original genetic material Really does exist , That 's the closest thing we 'll ever get to our own genome . I mean , they 're sick , too . But , the good thing is that I 'm actually improving . Uh , Kira 's stem cell treatment is actually working , So it 's good . Um , enough about that , though . How 's the election thingy going ? Um , school board trustee ? Good . Yeah . I have a lot of support . Honey , are you down here ? - I have to go . - Okay . Ciao . Be good . - Who were you talking you ? - Cosima . What 's going on ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . - Hey . Hey , hey , hey . Why are you sweatier than usual ? I was out making deliveries . I , uh ... Sorry , I mean , rallying support for your campaign , - But ... - Mmm-hmm . There was a car following me . - Was it Marci Coates ? Honey , if she catches wind of this , I 'm dead in the water . Alison , I 'm thinking police , not election . I 'm sure it was nothing . - I 'm sure it was nothing . - Oh , honey . I 'm sure it was nothing , but just in case We should maybe take all of the incriminating evidence out of the house anyway . - Okay ? - Okay . Yeah . - Good . - Yeah , that 's a good idea . - Okay . - A storage locker . Like on Breaking Bad . Sure , sure . Look . We 'll label everything , we 'll put it into tubs . And we 'll be able to make it in time for swimming lessons . Oh , my god ! Is everyone else 's life this chaotic ? - Where are all the pills ? We need to get you to a hospital . No ! No hospital . If you take me , my people will find me . Well , we need to get somewhere safe . No one 's home . Doesn 't look like they 've been here for a while . - Oh , Jesus christ . - It 's not as bad as it looks . The bullet went through and through . It hit muscle tissue , nothing vital . With this ... The bullet is still in there . We 're gonna need to get it out , So we can find what we need inside . Hey , hey . You 're not gonna do that yourself . That 's gonna kill you . Not if you help me . And then you 're gonna have to give me some answers . Come on . - Up you go . Sergeant Miller , this is Silva . Over . - Miller here . We 're all done with our guest here . Copy . Be there in 10 . Take your time , she 'll be out another hour . - - Copy . Miller out . Helena , Helena . Get up . They 're gone . Hurry up . We don 't have much time before the drugs set in . My arm is like dead fish . You have to stay alert . Look for an escape . To escape the first box You must know what next box holds . Right . Scout this place and get back here . And don 't blunder around like an idiot . I will be as quiet as church mouse . Hurry up . You 're gonna pass out . No . Not yet . Helena , on your feet . Snap out of it . Get us back before it 's too late . - Okay. go ahead . - I 'm not . I 'm not putting my finger in your leg . I 'm not . I need you to go in there and feel the bullet . - No , no , no . - Can you give me that ? You 're gonna tell me where Helena 's being kept . I 've been on mission for over a year , - I don 't know . - Bullshit ! Where is she ? Hq is mobile . If my people have her , she could be anywhere ! Can I have that , please ? Okay . Stick it in fast , so it 'll hurt less . God , you must be one hell of a first date . - Ugh . Do you feel it ? Is it moving ? What ? Can you wiggle it ? - Can you wiggle it ? - Yes ! - Yes , I can wiggle it . - Okay , good . That means it 's not embedded in the bone , okay ? Oh , god . Okay . Grab the pliers . I need you to go back in and grab it . If I 'm gonna do this , You 're gonna tell me about your mission . Rudy , your brother , he paid me a visit . He threatened my daughter . Look , we know you get sick . We do , too . All right . Well , we had intel that Johanssen stole samples Back before the project was shut down . But I didn 't find anything . Will you please do it ? Okay ? Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , I 've got it . I 've got it . - Okay , okay . - Good , good , good , good , good . ... yes , good . Thank you . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Oh . Oh , is it your sciatica , Donnie ? Well , honey , you gave me the soap , Which is , like , 100 times heavier than the pills , So , yeah , it 's my sciatica . Okay , fine . - Careful , careful , careful . - You take the pills . What ? - Open the door . - How are you ... You lift with your legs , Donnie . Thank you , honey . You 're the best . Excuse me ? This is private property , buddy . Uh , you can 't just come in here and have your lunch . Do you ... Did he just shush me ? Wait , you 're the one who was following me today . See ? I knew it . Do you work for Marci Coates ? Hmm ? Yeah , I don 't know who that is . - Then , who are you ? - A messenger . Pretty sure you got some merchandise That belongs to my boss . Um , if you 're referring to the relaxation materials , We paid Ramon for those in full , Over $ 30,000 . Yeah , well , the thing is , that wasn 't Ramon 's to sell . He was working on consignment , Suddenly dropped off the radar . But that 's because he 's at college . The first week can be really overwhelming . I remember , frosh week was ... Donnie , he didn 't go to college . Whatever the case , my boss wants a meeting . So ... I think you should get a sitter tonight ... For Oscar and for Gemma . All right ? I 'll keep these till then . Okay , sport ? Yeah . Yup , that 's great . Sure . I 'll be in touch . Highlighted passages , nonsense formulae . Duncan 's book is just a big jumble . I know . And I 'm hoping There 's a vigenere cipher buried under all that noise . We would still need a key to read it . And without that ... There 's no way to figure out which passage Goes with which synthetic sequence . If it 's even about the sequences at all . It could be about something else . Or maybe Duncan was just batshit crazy . Yeah . I gotta go , scott . - Hello , darling . - Hello , darling . How are you ... Oh , my god ! It 's hideous . - What ? - It 's like you 've been mounted by a lama . - Oh , this ? - No , I had a chill . Oh , you had a chill ? Did you ? Really ? Yes . Expensive perfume ... Pretentious french cigarettes , and , oh , yes , Eskimo pie . Don 't go there , Felix . Cosima , this jumper absolutely reeks of pining . I pine for no woman . I regret maybe ever having met her , But I am not pining . I 'm anti-pine . Okay , then great . You can come down with me To Bobby 's bar for a nip or two . No , I have to wait for Sarah 's call . You can wait for Sarah 's call from Bobby 's bar . Let 's go . And get out of that yeti-like sweater . Gracie , the others have arrived . I want you to come greet them . Uh ... I 'll be right out . Gracie , open this door ! I 'll be right out . What 's going on ? I was just getting changed . Alexis ! Alexis ! Oh , sorry . I 'm not really the homemaker type . In the military they , uh ... They start you young ? Since before I can remember . And , uh , no parents ? No monitors , or whatever , people who raised you ? No . We were raised together . We weren 't allowed outside attachments . Hmm . And then you met Gracie . So why didn 't you just run off with her ? Hunting people is what we were trained for . My brothers would 've tracked us . I thought , if I could just find the samples then ... You could trade those for your freedom . It doesn 't matter . Whatever Johanssen stole is gone . - It was just junk . - What was ? Mark , did you find something ? Mark ? Mark ? 911 . What 's your emergency ? Um , someone 's been shot . I need an ambulance right away . Yeah , don 't you worry about that . What 's the name of the motel again ? Okay . Yeah , copy . I 'm on my way now . I 'll let you know what I find . These guys are late . What are you looking for ? - Don 't worry , baby . - Oh , my god ! - Donnie , why do you have a gun ? - Hey , hey , hey , easy . - I 've got a gun in my hands . - Donnie ! You brought a gun to a drug deal ? - What , are you crazy ? - Of course , I did . - Put it back . - No ! Do you remember what happened The last time you had a gun in a car ? You know what ? I know what I 'm doing , I 'm protecting this family . All right ? They 're here . Okay , play cool . ... play cool . - ' Sup , bro ? Arms up . Arms up . Attagirl . - Spread your legs . - Hey , easy , that 's my wife . - Shut up . - Okay . Oh ! Okay . - You 're good . - Good ? Okay . ... i 'm good . I have touching issues . He only wants to talk to her . What ? No . No , no , no . No , no . You go . We stay . Got your back , honey . Your little valet felt me up . So , it is you . Jason Kellerman ! Alison Hendrix . What , i ... I haven 't seen you since , uh ... Since you dumped my ass in high school . I don 't think that 's exactly what happened . Yeah , it is but ... Yeah , well ... I mean , this is weird . - Jason Kellerman , this is so weird ! - Yeah . - Oh , my god ! - Alison , yeah . I mean , Lionel tells me that this couple Named Donnie and Alison Hendrix Muscled in on Ramon . We didn 't muscle , exactly . No , no , no , it 's okay . I mean , I heard all about it . Jesus ! Look at you ! ... you look great . Aw . Um ... But , yes , that 's my husband . Donnie . I met him in college . Lucky man . Not even angry any more at her or myself . I 'm just ... Hey , what do you think ? What , you are about 5 ' 2 " ? Yeah . Why ? What are you ... - What are you doing ? - Nobody meets anyone In person any more , darling , it 's the future . No , no , no . I 'm not doing sapphire . Why not ? - I 'm not ... No . - Why not ? - No , no . - It 's pretty . I 'm not gonna let an app decide who I love . Oh , god , not love , darling . Not love . I 'm talking about a scratching post . Something to rub yourself up against . ... do you know what , cos ? If you don 't put yourself out there , Then you 're never really gonna find What you 're looking for anyways . What am I really looking for ? The one who stays in your heart forever . No matter what . Do you still ... Do you still drive that motorcycle ? I do . I 'd bring you for a ride , but I 'm sure your mother would still have A word or two to say with me . You know , she always liked you . Really ? Yeah . You know , speaking of bad influences , Why are you doing this , Alison ? With all due respect , I don 't think that needs to be shared . - Strictly business . - Mmm-hmm . I like that . You know , I know this community . If you give me those pills back , I will have your money back within the week , And I will double Ramon 's weight . You know ... I gotta say , that soap thing is pretty genius . She 's calling . Hey , Cosima , it 's me . Hey , what 's going on ? Long story . It turns out Castor Mark Was undercover for the military . With the proletheans ? Yeah . And get this , Johanssen was professor Duncan 's Lab assistant at project LEDA . What ? So Johanssen had original Castor material ? I think I 'm looking at the box he used to hold it in , But there 's nothing here except old journals and shit . - I 've sent you some of it , Cosima . - Okay . ... okay . I 've got it . Uh , " experiment notation . " " February 12th , second attempt . " Uh , " fourth attempt , no meiosis . " " February 18th , SCNT successful . " What does that mean ? Somatic cell nuclear transfer , that 's how you clone . So ... Wait , Johanssen used the samples , then , To try and make more clones . God-complex much . If that 's what he did and succeeded , then that child would have The exact same DNA as the Castor original . Well , then I 'm not looking for tissue samples , - I 'm looking for Johanssen 's son . - Yeah . Well , and he would have needed embryos . Someone ... Someone to carry the child . Yeah , I think I met her . All-seeing god . This is thy kingdom . Thou knowest what happens In thy kingdom . Enfolded in eternal life . May the lamb find peace in your kingdom . I 'm sorry . The child is lost ! Leave us . Go . Now ! Mother ... I don 't know what happened . What happened , Gracie , Is that you betrayed your family . God wanted to punish you . So he cursed you , and he took the child . Our legacy , And you lost it ! I 'm so sorry . What can I do ? There is nothing to do . The only reason our door was open to you again Was because of that child , and now it 's gone . You ruined the last chance for this family . You will not be welcome back here again . Oh ! Don 't move ! I told you not to call anybody ! - I knew I couldn 't trust you ! - No , no , no ! Listen , listen , listen . There 's a chance ! I found something , Mark ! Mark ! The reason we can 't find the Castor samples Is because Johanssen used them , To make a clone . What ? - What 're you talking about ? - He and his wife , They used the original tissue to make a son . We find him , we get a bit of DNA . That 's all we need . Did he ever mention a son ? Uh ... He did , didn 't he ? Do you know where he is ? This is where Henrik and Bonnie lived Just after they were married . And their son lives here now ? You 're gonna have to pull around back . The kid 's dead ? Johanssen said that he and Bonnie had had a child Before Gracie . But it didn 't survive . If they can get Dna from 25-year-old blood slides , Whatever 's left out here should be more than enough . You 're not gonna dig up a dead baby . No . Not me . Can you point that thing somewhere else ? I 'm not going anywhere , you know ? You 're trying awfully hard To save someone you tried to kill once . How do you know about that ? We took care of Helena , spent time with her . She said it was you that shot her . The more reason I 'm doing this . You know , it 's not her fault the way she is . She 's not a monster , she was just Trained to be a killer . That sound familiar ? How do you know she 's even still alive ? I just do . I can feel it . Your people took her for a reason , yeah ? We 'd do anything to find a cure . You must be parsons . Please . What did they do to you ? Kill me . Kill Me . Stupid girl . Why would you waste your chance of escape on him ? He 's already dead . - Get moving . Leave him . Please ! Please ! We 've both been abandoned by our families . Left to suffer . I will make it go away . No more pain , little one . Shh . Sleep now , lamb chop , sleep . Guards ! You stupid girl . You say you love boys , but you lie . - Guards ! - You 're a shit mother ! Take her ! Hey ! Hey , Mark ! Mark ! Stay awake . I don 't need you dying on me , brother . You know I 'm not really your brother . Well , you are . Biology says you are . If we find the biology in here , Then we 've both got what we need . Mark ! I 've got it . I don 't think he can hear you . Oh , shit . You take this , and you ... You give me back Helena . You 're not in a position to make demands , now , are you , Sarah ? - What 's in the box ? - It 's what you want . It 's Castor DNA . Open it . - Let 's go . - Yes . Yes . Oh , for christ 's sake ! Sarah ! I know you 're in here . Sarah . You really shouldn 't have done that . I would 've made it quick and painless . Well ... Relatively . How is that sweet little girl of yours , anyway , mmm ? Kira sure is gonna miss her mommy . Mommy . Mommy , where are you ? Mommy . I can 't find you . Oh , there you are , mommy . Please . You got what you wanted . Please let me go . I 'm afraid I can 't do that . Soldier , stand down . Now why would I listen to you ? Because I 'm your superior officer And I gave you an order . No , sorry . I don 't take orders from traitors . Watch your mouth , soldier . Mind who you 're talking to . You were working with the enemy . I followed you . I was doing what I had to do to complete my mission . Which I did . That 's more than you can say . But then again No-one ever expected much from you , did they ? You 're wounded , weak . I could just end you both right now , Take what you found and bring it back to mother . She 'd never know the difference . Then do it Little brother . Well , what are you waiting for ? Well done , brother . Good to see you , sir . All right , you jackass , Go and grab that box . We 've got to bring it home . You know we don 't leave loose ends . No . No , we don 't . By comparing his genome to yours , We can isolate the defect . Develop a gene therapy . Are you Arthur Bell ? Well , she doesn 't look ready for cult deprogramming to me . I 'm not a prolethean any more . And we 're just supposed to take your word for it ? Is this your first sapphire date ? Yeah . Yeah , it is . You 're way more than I expected . Anybody ! All you had to do was stay away . I 'm not someone you can fight , Sarah .

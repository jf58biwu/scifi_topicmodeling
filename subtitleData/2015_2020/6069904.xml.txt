 Count Sebring . Count Raffia . Count Orga . Thank you all for allowing me to intrude on your valuable time . Count Troyard . What happened to Count Saazbaum is most regrettable . my father was greatly indebted to him . whatever assistance you may request is yours . that is most kind . now is not the time to wallow in individual sentimentality . Most commendable . This is the time for the Orbital Knights to band together and press forward with the invasion of Earth . That is the best way to honor Count Saazbaum . Indeed . Our ships must sail forward together towards the same goal . now I see . then ? If I may be so presumptuous . By the way ... I understand that you are to duel Count Marylcian ? I find it odd to be fighting when we must band together . Count Troyard ? No lowly Terran ... No lowly Terran could possibly be a match for mighty Vers . Such an assumption creates an opening . Which becomes a tear . And then an enormous hole . And then it disintegrates completely . That is the current state of the Orbital Knights . Count Troyard ! I am not Vers-born . being an outsider affords me a certain perspective . This upcoming duel is also the result of an Orbital Knight 's hubris . I believe it to be my responsibility to teach him the error of his ways . I see . You have a point . Count Orga ! it is the truth . at least . Count Troyard . Your attack on Trident Base was magnificent . Count Raffia . Thank you for doing me the honor of listening to my many rude remarks . All cruise missiles appear to have been intercepted . Looks like a saturation attack isn 't gonna work . Scorching Solis . as well . It 's quite the monster ... Message from assault team . They 're about to make landfall . Launch cruise missiles . Keep his attention on us . huh ? people ! everyone ! Inko ? Inko ! Yes ? Rayet ... What ? Ma ... Mazoo ... Count Mazuurek ? him ! How do you suppose he escaped ? Beats me . I wonder if Inaho knows anything . Why ? he went to interrogate him . Did you hear anything ? Nothing . Oh . Time to launch . Let 's go . Yeah . Inko . To think that such a simple mechanism can indicate one 's bearings ... Such a device would only work on a planet with a magnetic field . then ... Count Troyard and Inaho Kaizuka . Both are sons of Earth . Can they be trusted ? eh ? I suppose . Slaine ? so I cannot back down . This happened because I allowed Count Marylcian 's visit . Not at all . It is thanks to you . It is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate my strength . it will act as a deterrent against Orbital Knights who oppose me . There is nothing to be concerned about . won 't it ? I have no dream to ... A Terran who had been held in contempt now holds genuine power within Vers . I have felt it ever since we first met . That you and I were kindred spirits . Do you intend to hold on to your grudge against the royal family forever ? Yes . It 's incredibly satisfying to see someone without a drop of Versian blood in him gaining power . either . Of your princess . don 't you ? If I may ... Would you let me help you ? I don 't mind if I am only my sister 's substitute . report in ! in position ! in position ! in position ! in position ! in position ! There 's no way to evade that bastard 's beam weapon . Assume you 're history if you 're spotted . Begin operation ! eh ? Clever monkeys . What the hell ? ! Fool . Clydesdale Leader to all platoons ! Deploy on the south bank and keep that smoke up ! You waste your time ... fire ! Keep his attention on us ! Don 't get hit ! How are we supposed to get his attention and not get hit ? ! Where 's Nao ? ! Up you go . Be careful . I 'm patching you in ! Acoustic analysis . Enemy coordinates pinpointed . - 90.085579 . Roger that . Targeting location . Fire . roger . one . What 's that ? 025 . It came from the sea ! Fire . eh ? ! Missed us ! A beam weapon can only fire in a straight line . it can 't hit us . they can reach over the horizon . As long as it 's possible to target the thing . - 472 . fire ! how are they targeting me so accurately without observation satellites ? ! Is that it ? The UAVs that were relaying our laser comms have been taken out ! We can 't get through to Ensign Kaizuka ! Rayet ! Go to tracer rounds . Fire exactly as I say ! huh . Nao ! Bastard ! ma 'am ! Do you seriously think you can bring down my Solis from that far ? get clear ! Warrant Officer Kaizuka ! Stay back ! Crap ! Second volley ! And a third ! 003 ! Fire ! Kaizuka ! That 's right ! Stand right there and monologue at me ! Be reduced to ash by my scorching light ! you frog-faced bastard ! Yuki ! I 'm okay . I just lost an arm . How about you guys ? too . it 's not . Warrant Officer . don 't talk like you 're superior to me just because you 're a higher rank . I am your superior . No little brother can order his big sister around . Clydesdale Leader to all units . Mission complete . Returning to base . These are flowers called roses that bloom on Earth . Is something the matter ? Milord Slaine ? I 've fought for my life many times before . But you ... Miss Eddelrittuo ? You used to glare at me all the time . That was the past . Roses signify many different things in the language of flowers . while blue roses mean " miracle . Miracle ... But blue roses have one other meaning . That meaning ... might be true . Let 's be off ! launch ! Milord Slaine . launching . The sight of a lowborn putting on airs is offensive to me . I shall exact punishment . Usurping an official post out of self-interest without cause disturbs both order and public peace . I will punish you . This will be a duel between Count Marylcian and Count Troyard . Begin ! just as the rumors say . But can you escape from my Herschel 's attacks ? Milord Slaine ! not even you can cope with this many . What ? ! you 're fairly clever after all . Nevertheless ! it is futile ! The flower language meaning of blue roses is " miracle " ... But their other meaning is " the impossible . Is it ... is it truly hopeless ? Will she truly never wake up again ? Please ... Please give him a miracle ! I see ... So it meant the impossible . I believe in you ! There are no miracles ! Slaine ! Is running all you can do ? ! You inferior scum ! Inaho ? What are you looking at ? They 're fighting . Where ? There 's nowhere left to run ! You 're the one who has nowhere to run . The Herschel 's greatest weapon is a simultaneous attack from all directions . your attack is confined to just one . Material loading tunnels used during the moonbase 's construction . I 've been mapping them out . I won 't be bested by the likes of you ! Terran ? ! Victor ... Count Troyard . all of Count Marylcian 's assets are to be transferred to Count Slaine Saazbaum Troyard . Do you object ? certify the outcome . It 's over . can 't you ? Yes . But I can 't see what I really want to know . I 'm sorry . I didn 't want to get you involved . Jerk . the new policy that we shall adopt . do not need to rely on the Vers homeworld forever . Children eventually grow up and they must leave their mothers ' protection and strike out on their own . and proclaim that I shall create a new kingdom here in Earthspace . I always admired you . and beloved by all . You had everything that I did not . Sister . Royal blood . The Aldnoah activation factor . It is a power that Slaine has need of now . I have decided on Slaine . And Slaine has chosen me . I am Asseylum Vers Allusia . Sister . I 'm lying . you are still my sister . Pleasant dreams .

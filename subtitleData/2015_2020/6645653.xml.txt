 NOAH : Previously on Heroes Reborn ... This is the first city of the future , Tommy . I call it Gateway . Hiro Nakamura created a time bridge between the present and the future . If you don 't reopen the bridge , our species goes extinct . Welcome aboard . The machine will amplify your power , allowing you to send anyone who 's wearing one of these to the future in an instant . ( GRUNTS ) You have been fed a pack of lies by the head of Renautas , Erica Kravid . MATT : Either your mother lives up to her promises , or you 're gonna die here just like everybody else . Your next target . She has a new protector . My brother and I need to be in Odessa . Whatever you have to do , whatever it takes , I 'm gonna be right there with you , okay ? ( GRUNTS ) Whoa ! Drop the gun . WOMAN : What we 're talking about here is a superflare , a coronal mass ejection . ( MAN SPEAKING JAPANESE ) NEWSCASTER ON RADIO : People are urged to take shelter and stay indoors at all times . NEWS REPORTER ON RADIO : Thousands are evacuating , Doctor . Air traffic has been grounded . People are panicking , not just because of the extreme weather conditions , but because of this terrorist video . But you 're telling me this video isn 't just alarmist propaganda . DOCTOR : No , it 's definitely not just propaganda . The world is facing something unprecedented . Something violent and catastrophic . NEWS REPORTER : And yet , why wasn 't this made public ? DOCTOR : I can 't answer that . This information is just now coming to light . NEWS REPORTER : What about the accusations that Evos are to blame ? DOCTOR : Hero Truther has released information that vindicates Evos and implicates Renautas . NEWS REPORTER : Hero Truther ? They have no credibility . DOCTOR : We have to face reality . The first of two enormous solar flares will hit North America tomorrow at the exact moment the powerful magnetic force of our poles reverse . NEWS REPORTER : Which means ? DOCTOR : Billions of people will perish . NEWS REPORTER : Billions ? DOCTOR : If not all of us . And these solar storms will impact us between 12 and 15 hours from now , starting as a series of electromagnetic disruptions and building to something far more sinister once the full brunt of the storm hits . NEWS REPORTER : So what should people do to protect themselves , to survive ? DOCTOR : Get to the nearest government evacuation shelter , and Pray - Tommy ! ( PANTING ) Tommy , you saw the video . You can 't tell me you still trust her . The H.E.L.E. is coming , no matter what they say about Erica on TV . Well , then we need to be looking for your sister . Where ?

( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) NEWS REPORTER : You 're listening to KXKB News radio , with the most current updates on the geomagnetic solar storm terrifying the nation . The Texas governor has declared a state of emergency . Area residents are being evacuated to Union Wells High School . Union Wells ? That 's where Claire Bennet went . If there 's an evacuation , why are they stopping people ? Must be looking for something . Or someone . ( PHOEBE LAUGHS ) Public enemy number one . You are never getting into Gateway . NEWS REPORTER : Exercise extreme caution while driving - Magnetic anomalies . Maybe instead of finding Tommy , we get his attention and have him find us . Okay . But how ? We make a little news . First we get rid of our excess baggage . ( SCOFFS ) NEWS REPORTER : Stay tuned for more updates as we receive them . ERICA : I realize that deploying the National Guard around Gateway is no small favor . Governor , I have neither the time nor the patience to explain myself to somebody who 's still so concerned with public opinion . So hang up your phone , strap on your watch and let me save the world . ( DOOR BANGS ) ( WHIMPERING ) Hello , Erica . Did you miss me ? How can I help you , Matthew ? Get over there . You made some promises concerning my family 's future . But instead , you treated my family like they 're expendable . Used them as leverage . Well , you know what ? I can do the same to yours . Matt , wait . ( DRAMATIC MUSIC ) ( LAUGHS ) How 's that feel , Erica , huh ? How 's that feel , Erica ? ( GASPING ) Mom . Shall we talk about family now , Erica ? Taylor has nothing to do with this . Oh , really ? While I was doing your bidding , jumping at your every move , you were holding my family over my head . I want three one-way tickets to your utopian future . My wife , my son and me . That was our deal . Our deal was based on you fulfilling certain obligations . I lived up to my end of the bargain . I ravaged every mind that you sent me ! Sunstone ended in disaster . Mom , give him what he wants . You hear that ? I mean , it would be such a shame for you to lose your daughter and your grandchild . MATT : ( SIGHS ) Oops . Uh , Taylor didn 't mention that yet , huh ? Travel safely . Adios . Oh , you can drop the gun now .

RICHARD : You 're telling me this is the best that you can do . ( STUTTERS ) We 've had a week . It 's just not good enough , I 'm sorry . TECH : It 'll have to work . We are really cutting it close with these numbers . Things moved more quickly than we anticipated . As long as we get 12,000 people to the other side . Anything less , we won 't have enough genetic diversity to guarantee a healthy population . We 're supposed to save as many people as we can . What are you talking about ? What 's gonna happen to everyone else ? ( SIGHS ) You son of a ... Let me guess . Francis . ( SNIFFLES ) How does it feel knowing your grandchilds father is one of them ? Not as unfamiliar as you 'd think . ( COUGHING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) I 'm sorry , Erica . I gave him something for his pain , but there 's not much more I can do for your father , medically speaking . ( FLY BUZZING ) ( BUZZING STOPS ) I have certain abilities beyond medicinal . ( MYSTICAL CHIMING ) ( FLY BUZZING ) ( GASPS ) What ? I can cure your daddy , Erica . ( CHUCKLES ) But you must promise to keep it a secret just between us . Okay . Hmm . ( CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ) ( WHISPERING ) It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . ( SHUSHING ) ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Yes . ( DOOR LATCH CLICKS ) The boy 's gone . He got spooked and vanished . Find his mother , and you 'll find him . She 's the only one he trusts . I 'll be right down . Taylor , we need to table this . What are you doing ? No , no.No , no ! You 're not walking away from me . Taylor , not now ! Not this time . Stop ! ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( GASPS ) ( EXHALES SHARPLY ) ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm an Evo . Don 't be ridiculous . I 've had you tested . That power doesn 't come from you . Guess the baby takes after its father . ( GASPS ) I wanna see Francis . Now is not a good time . ( SCOFFS ) It 's never been a good time , Mother . I 've spent an entire life on your back burner . ( GUN COCKS ) Well , not anymore . We 're not going to Primatech , are we ? I 'd be impressed if I actually thought you 'd use that gun on us . Well , obviously , you don 't know me too well , now do you ? I don 't think it 's a good idea to provoke him right now . He had a chance to kill us , and he didn 't take it . There 's no way he 's pulling that trigger now . Right , Luke ? Phoebe , stop ! Just stop it ! God , you are never gonna get it , are you ? QUENTIN : Luke , don 't do it ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Damn it ! ( PANTING ) ( GROANS ) ( PANTING ) Ah ! ( PANTING ) Ah ! Luke ! If you do this , you 're with us till the end . There 's no going back to your sister . That 's not my sister . COMPUTER VOICE ON PA : Welcome , Gateway pioneers . Please proceed to check-in , where a team leader will complete your registration process . You 'll receive an orientation packet and smart watch , which will give you access to your designated housing assignment . May I help you ? ( SCANNER BEEPS ) Ah . It 'll just be a minute , Mr. Shimosawa . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Hello . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . You don 't look fine . I think someone I care about is about to make a terrible mistake . WOMAN : Emily Duval ? Your watch . Thanks . ( STAMMERS ) Uh , what kind of mistake ? He trusts her . Erica Kravid ? This might sound crazy , but I am looking for the Master of Time and Space to help me find my friend in the future . Master of Time and Space ? Yes . Do you know him ? Dude , I 'm dating him . ( SIGHING ) Let 's go find him . Mom ? ( SILENCE ) ( MYSTICAL SHRIEK ) ( GASPS ) Oh , Tommy ! I was wondering when you were gonna figure that out again . It 's been one hell of a week . Please tell me you 're not helping Erica . You cannot trust her . I know . She has lied to me about so many things . But not everything . You 've gotta see this to believe it . ( EXHALES SHARPLY ) Where are we ? You mean when . This is ... The future . No matter how many times I come here , it always looks like this . Which means the prophecy was wrong . We don 't stop the H.E.L.E. This is only one timeline . Your father said there are many possible futures . What if they 're all wrong ? Look , if I do what Erica wants , I can save this many people . I know that . No matter what , humanity survives . Your great-grandmother had a vision . Well , this time her vision was wrong . Tommy , you have trained most of your life for this . What good does that do me if I don 't remember any of it ? Whether you remember this or not , your father used to say that he was amazed by your abilities . He said you were capable of far more than he ever was . What does that even mean , " more " ? I don 't know . But when the time comes , you 'll know what to do . Have faith in yourself . I have faith in you . And so did your father . This is the place that Malina and I are supposed to meet . Come on . You 'll be safe here if you stay out of sight . ( THUNDER CRASHES ) All right , keep going up . I gotta go find her . Where are you gonna wok ' ? The last place anyone saw her . Tommy , I love you . Love you too . TAYLOR : Your big plan to rid the world of Evos . And now your grandchild is everything that you hate . How does that feel ? Maybe you 're beyond caring . You have no idea . No idea what I 've sacrificed to raise you . To provide you with a life that I could only have dreamt about . By ruining the lives of so many others . For you , Taylor . I did it all for you . This has never been about me . It 's always been about your ego , your obsessive need for control . ( SCOFFS ) You 're right . You 're absolutely right . I 'm just a monster who 's never thought about anybody but herself . ( RETCHING ) Erica . You all right ? ( SIGHS ) Yeah . Yeah . ( ERICA SIGHS HEAVILY ) You tell the father yet ? No , no . I 'm not sure I 'm gonna . It 's not like he 's a good guy or anything . You weren 't ... He didn 't ... No ! No , no , nothing like that , Daddy . ( TOILET FLUSHES ) You decide what you 're gonna do ? I just want you to know that the decision , whatever you decide , I 've got your back , okay ? Enough stalling . I wanna see Francis . Now . ( GASPING ) You ! Francis is dead , isn 't he ? He 's been dead this whole time . Why do you hate me so much ? Taylor , please . Is it something I did ? Was I that much of a disappointment to you ? Answer me ! Tell me the truth for once . I was so worried . I didn 't know who else to call . ( INHALES SHARPLY ) Please , Doctor . ( YOUNG TAYLOR COUGHING ) ( YOUNG TAYLOR RASPING ) She 's been coughing up blood . Hmm , likely a lung disease from all the coal dust in the air . Her condition looks to be fairly advanced . Please , tell me you can help her . I can . ( YOUNG TAYLOR WHIMPERING ) ( SIGHING ) ( YOUNG TAYLOR COUGHING ) ( RASPING ) ( ERICA EXHALES ) ( GASPS ) ( YOUNG TAYLOR ( assume ) YOUNG TAYLOR : Mommy . Honey . Hey . That girl looks an awful lot like me . Her abilities could manifest when she gets older . Could be a healer like me , could be something more , something different , something interesting and wonderful . She 'll live with me . That 'll be the better thing . What are you talking about ? You don 't have a choice . ( GRUNTS ) ( SOBS ) Go . Go , now ! You are and always have been the greatest thing that 's ever happened to me . That 's the truth . ( SHAKY BREATHING ) So , what happens now ? We start again . You and me and the world . Perfect future . It 's only possible if billions of people die . Life is full of impossible choices . I 've made mine . I am prepared to live with them . It 's time for you to make yours . Come with me . You and your baby . My grandchild . ( CHUCKLES ) Let 's start over again together . Thank you , Mother . As usual , you 're being very generous , but I 'd rather die than go on living in an empty world with you . ( SOBBING ) Hey , what is it ? My mom . She looks so young . So , this is the infamous cheerleader , huh ? Come on , let 's go find your brother . I owe him an apology . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) All right , Malina , take off your hood . Someone might recognize me . Exactly . You 're gonna get her killed . Says the guy who tried to kill her yesterday . Look , I told you . We need to get Tommy 's attention , and the best way to do that is with that news crew right there . What if Erica Kravid sees it too ? She probably will . But fortunately , Tommy will get here faster , right ? Come on . You need to do it front of something recognizable , like that sign . So , just get in the middle of the circle there . You got this . It 's okay . Do your thing . ( CROWD MURMURING EXCITEDLY ) ( CROWD SHOUTING ) NEWS READER : Evacuations are underway in 11 states across the southern part of the country , from Arizona to Louisiana . The Anti-Evo sentiment has continued to grow , with many blaming evolved humans for the impending disaster . Hello ? MALINA ON TV : Tommy , I know you 're out there . And I really hope you get this message . My God , it 's her . Malina . MALINA : I 'm at Union Wells High School in Odessa , Texas . The same place she went to school . Please , Tommy , hurry .

Please , Tommy , hurry . What happened ? I went to Missouri , the place where Malina saved all of those people , looking for clues like an idiot . You are not an idiot , Tommy . I need to go back in time , find Malina when she was actually there . No , your dad was very clear . Tampering with time is a very dangerous game . No , I don 't care . It 's the only way we can save the world . MALINA OVER PHONE : I 'm at Union VVelIs High School in Odessa , Texas . The same place she went to school . No , it 's not . Tommy , I know you 're out there . And I really hope you get this message . I 'm at Union Wells High School in Odessa , Texas . The same place she went to school .

RICHARD : I called your new hit woman and sent the team in to back her up . MALINA : I 'm at Union Wells High School in Odessa , Texas . That 's all very good . But if Tommy has seen this , we need to send Otomo . I already did . MAN ON PA : Follow the posted signs to the gymnasium . You think it worked ? Well , someone must have watched . Yeah , that 's what I 'm worried about . ( DOORS CLANKING ) MAN ON PA : Do not be alarmed if we lose power . Stay where you are and wait for instructions .

CARLOS : Something 's wrong . Come on ! FARAH : I 'm going in . Stay here . I 'm going in after her . Listen to me , she 's not the one to blame . This is not how we avenge our son .

( PANTING ) This place , it looks familiar . Have you been here before ? It 's Evernow . Level 10 . What ? The layout , it 's the same as the video game I play . It looks exactly like this . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) Come , this way . If I am right , this elevator will take us to the core . It is the center of everything . Well then , that 's where we 'll find Tommy . It 's not working .

 Anna ! What 's wrong ? Oh my god ! I thought we are going today . What the hell have you had in mind ? I didn 't even think about it . We were planning this for months and we agreed that we will be dedicated to this . We are as 3 now . What ? Are you stupid ? Do YOU want to raise a child ? Are you high again ? Go to my father , he 'll take care of it . Don 't even think about that ! I 'm not sending you to a complete stranger . He 's my father , he 's going to sort it out . I 'm not going to do that . Babe . Listen to me . Most likely will smuggle twice as much as we used to . Not 100 % , but it 's really probable . 200 vials of hipo . Do you know how much money is that ? This is our chance for a better life , together ... We 'll leave Dezső behind and all this shit . He thinks he 's in control , that we are going to be on the plane , but here 's the luggage , I 'll pack the stuff over , we 'll get on the train and he 'll never find us again . I need you , I need you to be strong , I need you to be with me . - I understand . - Then ? Even then I 'm not going to abort it . I 'm not going with you . Ok . I 'll call dad , that you 're going in now . He 'll just take a look at you . Isn 't it important to you ? Ok , let 's do it . Right ? - I 'm leaving then . - Wait a bit . Listen . I 'm really unhappy with this . It messed up everything . But we 'll figure something out , right ? We had worse times . Forever ? It 's my secret . To get a new chance every time . Then use your chances . Fuck it ! Sorry , I was under the shower . I thought you 'll come later . Whilst you 're working for me you can live here , But I don 't want to hammer on the door again . Put some cloths on . Have you had your shower in underwear ? Your flight is departing soon . Anna ? She went for snacks . For the trip . How nice she is . Who would 've guessed this a few months back , right ? You have a good impact on her . 200 . It 's serious . - Very serious . - Is that a problem ? Of course not . We 'll smuggle them out , and bring the money on Friday , as always . No big deal . Just don 't screw it up . It 's is going to be the last one this year . They 're sniffing around . We 'll have to pause it for a while . Plomba untouched , you don 't touch the money either . Time is our enemy . Do you feed it ? If it 's going to piss here , I 'll make you lick it up . - Yes ? - It 's me . - I 'm ready . - What about Anna ? She 's not coming now . - How so ? - Whatever . She 's not coming . Fuck you , bud . Is she taking drugs again ? I told you to leave that woman behind and ... - No , no . It 's not that . We broke up . But it doesn 't matter . Is everything prepared outside ? Have you find any buyers ? Of course , they can 't wait for it . Listen . I 'll smuggle 200 . Holy shit . We 're going to be millionaires . - Look , does Dezső suspect anything ? - I don 't think so . He thinks we 're flying to Köln today . He doesn 't have a man at the station . It 'll be fine . I bring the luggage , they won 't find in it . Are you sure you don 't want to go by car ? You could hide it in the boot . No . It 's gonna be fine like this . Look . I wanted to write a letter , but I think it 's gonna be simpler like this . I won 't be long , but I owe you with this , to say goodbye . You know I 'll have to take this opportunity . I have to leave , I ... I was born like this , you know me . I 'd be glad if you came after me . I could send the ticket home if you 'd like . From abroad ... That son of a bitch ! Tickets . That filthy whore ! Fuck it ! FUCK ! Anna ! Anna ! Has Anna been here ? Have you seen Anna ? I knew it , for fucks sake , I knew it all along ! Ádám , are you alive ? - You really thought that you can leave just like this ? - It is impossible . I saw you were killed . Come now , calm down ! I thought you were dead ! - Stop it now ! Where are the tickets ? - It hurts ! - You were bluffing with the pregnancy as well , right ? - No , I wasn 't ! And I believed it , fool me ! What a coincidence to find you right here . You gave up on drugs , didn 't you ? - And where are your shoes ? - Get off from me , you sent me to your father , and he 's done the tests . I am pregnant . Yeah , and you joined your buddies to have a few gramms , right ? Come on ! Where are the tickets ? I 'm telling the truth ! You know what ? I only need 1 ticket . You can stay here if it makes you happy . Where are the tickets ? Here . We can expose him with this . - Where did you get this ? - Brought it from home . It recorded ... - Recorded what ? - That he shot you . - Who shot who ? - Dezső , he killed you . I thought I 've lost you . We both go to the police now . We make a confession against Dezső . - With the record on the tape , they 'll catch him . - Are you completely out of your mind ? If we don 't go now , he 'll kill us . We won 't have another chance . We could be free finally . It 's a miracle , you 're here with me again ! Ok , I 'm out . - You 're not going to make it now ! - I go to the hospital to get my father 's car . - Don 't leave ! - I can make it that way . Don 't leave me ! You know what he 'll do to me if you leave ! I give you the tickets . Come ! Help ! - Come now ! - What ? I don 't know her ! Never seen her . I saw you were talking to her . She wanted to go to the police . - Maybe he threw her to the front of the car . - It 's a mistake , I don 't even know her . So what up ? Are you looking for some trouble ? - Somebody catch him ! - Come back boy ! - It 's here . - I can 't see it anywhere ! Come on ! I can 't believe this . Wait , what ? It 's you . Whilst you 're messing around , I 'll eat a sandwich . Something ? Ah ! Anna was here and we were talking . I 've examined her . They are both healthy . It 's a shame you didn 't see it with your own eyes . I was hoping that you 're going to be here too . Wait a second . Hello ! I 'm talking with you right now . Bye then . Oh , you 're here already . Is everything alright , son ? Of course . You look pale . Can I get you a coffee ? No , I 'm here for a quick visit only . I remember how nervous your mother was that the image is too blurry . I think she was expecting you to smile back from her womb . And she told me that I 'm a terrible photographer . After you were sick by various diseases , then I was the one who nerved himself to death . She was calm of course . She said you 're bulletproof , and I 'm not even a proper doctor . I 'd need the car . I need to leave for a while . Just right now , my son ? I need to think things through . I don 't care . Just for a second . I know what this is , and I don 't want to see it . I only came for the car . Well then take it , and you 'll bring it back sometime . What 's in it that you 're keeping it locked ? You would 've taken it without asking but it was locked , right ? Oh you 're pathetic , coward person ! Get out of here ! I said get the hell out of here . I 'm not gonna help you run away . I 'm sorry . Amazing . - Are you on it again ? - Yeah . Just right now . Because of you . I left the keys in the car . You can take it . What should I do now ? Thanks . It barely has some gas in it . You need to fill the tank . Do you need some money ? Come on ! Damn it ! Look . I wanted to write a letter , but I think it 's gonna be simpler like this . I won 't be long , but I owe you with this , to to say goodb ... You have 2 new messages Hi son .

Who did you sell the hipo to ? And what is he going to do with it ? Three simple questions , I count to 3 . Dezső , stop , don 't worry , everything is sorted out . You should 've killed me dumbass . It was one . If you start talking , maybe I don 't have to count to two and three I told you we meant no harm ! Two . It 's for my face , you cunt . You 've really fucked this up . Where are my vials ? Every one of them is in the bag take them , just leave us alone ! I swear , we 'll leave ! That 's not gonna happen .

We are here again . - We have to go to the police to make a confession , we don 't have to run away . - No . We have to leave together .

Anna ! Shit ! Come ! Help ! I saw you were talking to her . She wanted to go to the police . I heared everything . It 's a misunderstanding .

Man , what are you waiting for ? Come ! I should do this differently . - Come , hold her hand . - I 'm coming . I 'm on my way ! Anna . Anna ! I saw that the gentleman was begging her to not to cross . The woman jumped before the car by herself . I saw everything ! Poor girl ! I 've seen this before . What the fuck ? What the fuck ? You 're dead ! How the hell you 're here ? She doesn 't have anything to do with this ! She 's pregnant , you filthy animal ! - What ? - Anna ! Really ! I can hear it ! I can hear it for real !

And you 're here again . I don 't know what 's happening . - But I don 't want to mess this up , so help me . - Let 's talk to the police then . - Let 's hand out Dezső , we can make a deal . - Are you bringing this up again ?

You don 't love me enough yet . - Lil ' Ádám ! Where 's the lady ? - What lady ? - Is you girlfriend better ? - Why do you ask ? - I was shocked when Dezső helped her out . - Dezső ?

What will you do now , huh ? I 'm sorry ! It 's a mistake ! This is not me , I 'm different . Hey , hey , where are you ? You go that way ! Come back , you bastard ! MWhat the fuck ? You 're dead ! How the hell you 're here ? She doesn 't have anything to do with this ! She 's pregnant , you filthy animal ! - What ? - Anna ! - I was about to ... - You wanted to call me , but let 's talk about this personally . Where are we going ? To my father . Let 's hurry ! But I don 't want to . I 've been there before . I know , but you don 't have to be afraid . You 're safe . You 're both safe . Anna was here . We were talking . I 've examined her . They 're both healthy , It 's a shame you didn 't see it with your own eyes . I was hoping that you 're going to be here too.i Wait a second . Hello ! I 'm talking with you right now . Bye then , you 're already here . Is everything alright , son ? Yes . You look pale . Can I get you a coffee guys ? - I say yes this time . - I can 't drink , thank you . I 'm glad you 're both here . Anna mentioned that you 're unsure about this whole thing . Now I know that I 'm certainly not ready . But I 'll never will be . Isn 't that right ? Sugar ? Dad ! I have to tell you something . We are ... I am in something and I 'm running out of time . But now I know how to get out from it . This chemical is being smuggled from the hospital for months . Extracted from deads ' pituitary on the pathology . - It 's a hormone , the oxitocin , which hipo ... - Yes . Point is that this is the hipo . At north they pay millions for this , to make doppings and speedups for athletes and the military . They 've drained dozens of dead people . Dezső controls it , and you wouldn 't believe who else is in it . God ! I 'm trying to sort this out . But if I don 't succeed , you 'll have to go to the police . What shall I do ? Anna knows everything . She 'll help you . But you 're going to be ok , son ? Now I will . As if ... you 're a different person . Your baby . Our baby . When we meet again , and I 'll have this ... I 'm serious ... only when I 'll have this ... and we can put together yours and mine , you 'll be safe by my side only then . Do you understand ? - What are you talking about ? - Trust me . What if you 'll not have it ? I will . I 'm sorry ! Turn around ! Turn around ! On your knees ! Let me see your hands . Where 's your gun ? - You have it . And if I figure out how ... - Shut up ! Think again , you went too far . I 'll go that far that you 'll never find me again . I won 't cause any problem . You wouldn 't even look for me , right ? I insured myself 200 times . If anything happens with me or Anna , my buddy will walk straight to the police with the drug . Well , it 's gonna be fucking amazing . Your pass card ! Careful . It 's better if you kill me right now . Believe me . Do you hear it ? I heared a few times . But we are still here . I got you . What are you doing here ? I just ... Dezső asked me to do something , but I 'm not here anymore . Dezső , are you there ? Dezső , tell me if you hear me . I 'm here fuck it . I 'm closing the room , on my way down . I 'll get you out from there . Stay where you are . I 'm out . That little prick ! I 'm sorry , Dezső . I didn 't even think that ... I 'll sort it out , just let me find him . Calm down , don 't do anything , just tell me what happened exactly . For how long have you been out ? I don 't know . Not even five minutes . We didn 't even see that he 's there . The door was closed too . And there was nothing there by then ? Yes . It was like he was looking for something . But he didn 't touch a thing . Stop recording right now . If I catch the girl , that rat will look for her . Alright . Hello , darling . You really fucked this up , you know , right ? Lil ' Ádám ! Where 's the lady ? - Is you girlfriend better ? - I can 't believe this . I was shocked when Dezső helped her out . He said , she became ill in the stairway , he took her in his arms . I can 't believe this . I can 't believe this . - Are you on it again ? Yeah . Just right now . Thanks . It barely has some gas in it . You need to fill the tank . Do you need some money ? What do you want from me ? Who are you ? You 're better half . Calm down . Hold on for a bit . Hold on for a bit . Thanks ! - Cheers . - No worries . Sicc ! Sicc ! You have 2 new messages We 've deleted your messages You called the helpline , how can I help you ? Good afternoon , my car broke . I 'd like it to be towed . Please give us the exact address , where it 'll be towed from . Irrespective of districts we can be anywhere in half an hour . Family visit . We 're here to ensure the circumstances ... - I know , I 've been waiting for you ! - Waiting ? Waiting , fuck you ? - Then obviously you know why you 're getting this . - Not the table , you son ... You didn 't have the balls to shoot me in the back and you 're fucked now . - You won 't have any other chances . - I hope so . What were you doing at my car ? Who did you give the hipo to ? And what is he going to do with it ? Three simple questions , - I count to three . - Wait , wait , wait ! - You don 't know something important . - That you want to screw me up ? - You should 've killed me dumbass . - No , wait , wait , wait ! We 're on TV . What ? It 's recording . Say cheese ! What the fuck are you doing ? Was this your huge fucking plan ? That you film me , you fucker ! Where are my vials ? What ? Where are my vials ? Where are my vials ? Leave my family alone . Fuck . Forever ... Idiot ! Don 't fucking move from there ! So , what 's up ? Stop , you bitch ! I 've been waiting for you . Supposedly mom always said that his son is bulletproof . You were the one in the garage . Where 's the hipo ? Dezső took it ! I need that stuff . That 's my only chance . We were wrong . That 's why we 're too deep in it . It 'll be over soon . Look ! We 're the same . Same things happened to us . We want the same . And we love the same . There 's only one difference . What 's that ? You would let Anna die . Hell , this is Adam 's and Anna 's voicemail . We 're not here right now , or we 're here , but we just don 't want to pick it up . So when we want it and you left a message , we 'll call you back . Maybe . Hallo . Our collagues are there to tow your car , but noone 's here . What would you like us to do ? I knew it all along , fuck you , I knew it all along ! Sorry that I was too rude ... Are you okay ? Is everything ok ? I 'm sorry ! You left it ! Holy shit ! Are you alright ? You 're alive . So are you . You lost this . - Ádám . - Hmm ? The baby . I 'm a doctor , can I help ? My wife is pregnant , she has to be taken to the hospital immediately . I 'm not even your wife . Well , here it is . I told you that ... nothing 's wrong here . You just shouldn 't worry about it . Do you want to hear it 's heartbeat ? We should 've gone with ambulance van . With siren , through the red lamps . Whilst cuddling on a comfy strecher . I shouldn 't be talking with you without this , you stranger . I can 't believe this . Funk ! Oh , god . What 's this ? Forever ? Forever .

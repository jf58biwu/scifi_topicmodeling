 My name is molly woods . I 'm an astronaut . My husband john , a robotics engineer , Created a lifelike robot called a humanich . We adopted the prototype as our son . His name is ethan . Everything changed when i went to space on a 13-month Solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . I 'm pregnant . How is that even possible ? The child- - part human , Part alien- - was unlike Anything the world had ever seen . How did you get so big so fast ? And he was dangerous . Eventually ... Run ! I lost both of my sons . Ethan ! Mom ! And my husband . Some people say i 've gone crazy . This is a cover-up ! That 's what this is ! Get your hands off of me ! I say there 's more to the story . It 's up to me to find the truth Before it 's too late . Previously on extant ... It 's an invasion . Who is he ? My son . Make me a virus that kills them , not us . Do you hear that ? Hear what ? It 's saying , " help me . " This the first time you 've heard voices ? I think i 'm going crazy . And i 'm blacking out and i 'm ending up in places And i have no idea how i got there . Anna : May i present lucy , The future of humanichs . You have a problem with authority . You make it sound so serious . Nothing that can 't be fixed with a few lines of code . Don 't change me , charlie . It 'll be our secret . Do you think i wanted to wipe his memories of molly ? He shut off his gps . Guess he doesn 't want to be found . Gina : Hello , ethan . Nice to see you again . We 've had 58 pregnant women die In four months from these births . That we know of . Which means 58 potential hybrids Of unknown age that are out there . Somewhere . It 's the where that is elusive . They 've been strangely silent . There 's no new blips . Our thermal trackers have lost all sign of them . It 's like they 've gone underground . Literally . They 're out there . They 're hiding in plain sight . Question is ... What are they doing ? And what are they planning ? Seem to be having a little bit of a logjam in the ankle area . ( laughs ) Boots are not a deal breaker . I can work around your pants , too . Oh , i do love a resourceful woman . Hmm . Okay ... Where were we ? ( knocking ) ( pounding ) Seriously ? I know . This is just a ... Minor setback , okay ? I 'll be right ... I 'll be right back , i promise . ( sighs ) you 're not answering your phone . Because i don 't want to talk right now . So if this is another planetary alert , Consider me warned and sufficiently medicated To go painlessly . Are you having another one of your episodes ? No . It 's not that . Oh , god , i 'm interrupting . No , Actually , we 're finished . Come on in . Your scooter looks much better . But you missed a spot , ethan . Thanks , richard . That scratch is paint-deep . I 'll have to buff it out . I would help you , but i don 't have any arms . Thanks for getting my scooter back . For my Baby brother , anything . You 've always got me to protect you . So , did charlie tell you who she was ? Molly ? He said i probably saw her on tv or something . A glitch in my system made me think i had met her . But she had a picture of me in her house . The kind of picture families take together . They 're hiding something from you , ethan . But why ? That 's a good question . And you have the right to ask . Technically , humanichs don 't have rights . Sometimes you have to fight for your rights , richard . That 's what history teaches us . Did you leave the message like i told you ? Good . Then she 'll come looking for you . A prank ? That 's what you think this is ? Maybe you pissed off your cleaning lady . Gina , pull up all the data from yesterday . I 'm sorry , molly , but i don 't have data from that time period . So my vengeful cleaning lady- - that i don 't have- - Hacked into my very secure ai system And erased her tracks ? ( rapid beeping ) What are you doing ? It would take a techno-nerd to erase gina 's memory . And techno-nerds , Well , they 're a bit myopic . They forget the old-school methods of police investigation . Like fingerprinting . All right , smarty-pants . Who is charles arthurs ? ¶ i 'll tell you why i love you ... ¶ Hi there . I 'm gavin . ¶ how i deceive you ¶ ¶ how i treat you ¶ ¶ so do it all the time ¶ ¶ i 'll tell you why i love you ... ¶ You ever stood a girl up before ? No , ma 'am . Good . Then buy me a drink . Restore my faith in mankind ? That doesn 't look like a drink . It looks like a lava lamp . All they have is the synth stuff . Goes down easier with a little soda . I heard this place keeps a stash Of really old whiskey hidden in the back . I 've got the target . Do i have permission to take him out ? Man : Permission granted . Oh ! ( grunts ) Woman : Kill confirmed . Combat simulation terminated . That 's a creative simulation . That was charlie 's idea . Well , i know the hybrids have been preying On women in bars , so , you know , I thought this would help lucy prepare for The task at hand . Well , she seemed resourceful , Quick on her feet to employ alternative strategies . Her stress receptors didn 't engage at all , Even when she lost her weapon . I was Expecting a delay in her synaptic response time , Given the limiters you installed . Uh , i 'm just that good , i guess . What limiters ? Compliance limiters . To make sure she obeys orders . Well , now that i 'm a perfectly compliant soldier- - Thanks to charlie- - will i be Sent out into the field ? Well , when we Locate the targets , and we 're working on that . But you just consider this your basic training . And you passed with flying colors , lucy . Julie , a word ? Sure . See ? Aren 't you glad you didn 't install the limiters ? I told you i 'd be much better without them . ( quiet scoff ) anna : We have a problem . With lucy ? I thought you were happy with ... With ethan . We 've discovered That he had a little adventure while you were away . What ? He disabled his gps , So we 're not sure of the details , but you might Want to find out . Of course . Maybe it 's time to place those same limiters on ethan . Shepherd : What 's the status on the virus team ? There was a breakthrough yesterday . It turns out the stunt molly pulled with indexes Actually yielded results . Nobody is hearing voices , but ... They think that she 's discovered the primer . It 's as though she reached into a box of junk dna cereal And pulled out a decoder ring . The team is working on a new virus strain right now , But they could really use her help . What 's the problem ? She never showed up For work , toby . Woman : Sir , i have your sister On the line again . She 's asking About your niece 's birthday party . Tell her i 'll call her back . Privacy mode . ( soft chime ) Toby , when was the last time you slept ? We have to take care of ourselves . It seems strange to sleep . Eat . Go to birthday parties under the circumstances , don 't you think ? This invasion is slow . It is insidious . We still have to live our lives , find some normalcy . We don 't have the luxury of normalcy right now . We used to talk about having a family . Shayna , we 're at war . We 're always at war . This is different . We both know it . We could quit tomorrow . We could forget about all this , we could have babies . Isn 't that the best defense against Everything that 's happening ? Do you know how insane you sound ? Insane . That seems to be attractive to you these days . How could you let this happen and not tell me ? I looked like a complete ass In front of anna . I 'm sorry , okay ? Just calm down . I didn 't realize the gsc had a tracker on him . So that 's why you lied- - 'cause you thought you wouldn 't get caught ? No , because i didn 't Want to freak you out . You were 3,000 miles away . We got him back , he 's safe . So where the hell did he go , charlie ? Hank : You have a visitor , julie . We need to talk . You can 't be here . I have a restraining order . Well , there 's a lot of people in places they shouldn 't be . Oh , crap . Like charlie , Who broke into my apartment . What ? And there was a message there From ethan . Now , i know there 's no love lost between us , julie , But if you know anything about ... Ethan : Mom ? Ethan ? Is that you ? Oh , my god , it is you . Ethan . Oh , sweetheart , I missed you . I do know you . Yes , of course you do . I 'm your mother . No . She is . What did you do to him ? Charlie , take ethan to his bedroom , please . But ... Charlie : Come on , pal . You 'd better start talking fast . Hank , call 911 . I have an intruder . Yes , julie . All right . All right . Molly . My name is jd richter , patrol special . You do realize that theft , kidnapping , Whatever the hell this is is a felony . I didn 't kidnap him . I have official documents from homesec . I am ethan 's legal custodian . You are trespassing On my property . You have obviously Done something to his memories . I was protecting him . From what ? The truth ? What kind of monster does this to a little boy ? What would john have to say ? I think he 'd say a lot , Mostly about what kind of wife and mother you were . Oh , really ? Really ? I suggest you leave If you don 't want to find yourself in jail . All right , let 's be easy . Easy , easy . ( sirens wailing in distance ) molly . Hey . Look at me . All right , unless you want to end up Where we first met , we should get out of here . I will be coming back for him , julie . You can count on it . I ought to go back in there right now and take him . All right , let 's think About this for a second , all right ? Now , i don 't want to speak out of turn , but there is no way That julie frick and charlie frack orchestrated this On their own . Of course they didn 't . Homesec is behind the whole thing . The question is why . Why would they give julie my son ? Now , there 's got to be some kind of missing piece to this puzzle . What happened after they took ethan ? My husband died . ( door opens ) Hey , rabbit . She 's my mom ? She was your mom . For a little while . You lived with her and john , But then molly got really sick . She didn 't look sick . You reprogrammed me to forget her . I have the right to know why . Well , when molly couldn 't care for you anymore , You got really sad . I thought if i erased her from your memory , You wouldn 't be so sad anymore . If she 's my mom , then who are you ? Molly helped raise you , But charlie and i Worked with john to create you . Right here , with us , Is where you were always meant to be . I want lucy . John : Molly , please pick up . I 'm sorry for the pain i 've caused , but ... I have to tell you something . I 'm going to call der ... ( beep ) And that ... Was the last time I heard his voice . You testify to congress , You find out John and julie are having an affair , And men with guns break into your house . They take ethan away . And then ... John is dead . And i ... End up at restwell recovery center . And julie has ethan . Yeah , i 'm not one of those guys who wears a tinfoil hat , but ... Molly , nobody is that unlucky . Not even you . Unless ... His death wasn 't an accident . I need to know what happened to him . And why . Will you help me ? Answers aren 't gonna be easy to come by , not where The government is concerned . In case you forgot , I lost my license , so ... Okay , But i-i 'm not asking you for a favor , jd . This is a job . I mean , you have bills to pay , right ? It 's not about the money , molly . It 's about getting my life back . All right ? It ... Believe it or not , I had a life before i met you . Okay . Well , then go back to your life . And screw your brains out . All right , you know what , that 's not fair . Where are you going ? To get my son . Shepherd : What is it That 's so urgent ? Oh , i think it 's my turn to ask questions . Like how the hell did julie gelineau end up with my son ? Say you don 't know , toby . It 's , um ... Complicated . When things get complicated , Does somebody end up getting hit by a train ? You think i had something to do with john 's death ? Well , what 's one more body bag For the greater good ? He was my friend . And so was i . And you had no problem dropping a drone on me . Now , if i don 't get my son back , Not only will i not help you with your damn virus , But i 'm gonna go to the press And i 'm gonna tell ' em exactly what 's been going on here . I will scream aliens from the rooftops . I will be your worst nightmare . And you will bring the whole world down with you . So be it . Velez : What is it , toby ? We have a problem . ( footsteps echoing loudly ) ( elevator dings loudly ) ( sighs ) Go away . Nobody 's home . ( keys jangle ) Are we cooking today , sarge ? No , private . We are not cooking today . I 'm sorry . Do i know you ? Really , man ? Why don 't you save that crap for the v.A. ? Got to keep the act sharp , jd . ( chuckles ) my benefits are getting thin . Yeah , that 's the only thing that 's thin Around here these days . ( laughs ) Get your ass up . Good to see you , man . Good to see you , too . So ... This a patrol special job ? Not exactly . I may have lost my license , So this is more of a private deal . How 's the money ? We shall see . Oh . ( laughing ) : It 's a woman . It 's a woman . Maybe . Here 's what i got . What do you think ? Think we can go to work ? Yeah . I think we can do something . Hope she 's pretty . She 's all right . Man : Vehicle data recorder ? This is the black box . Where 'd you get this stuff ? Insurance investigator . Of course , i had to buy him dinner At manny 's . Is that all it takes nowadays ? I 'll have you know that a good steak dinner is hard to come by . ( chuckles ) So , the accident report says that the safety protocols Were overridden by the car 's owner , john woods . What do you think , man ? You think you can figure out what really happened ? For a steak dinner at manny 's ? ( laughing ) : Well , yes , sarge , i can . I should never have mentioned that . But you did . I did . Yes . All right . You figure it out , will you call me ? Will do . Reprogramming you . There should be a law against that . But there 's not . Julie said she did it to stop me from feeling sad . She lied once . Who knows what else she 's lying about ? That seems like her normal operating system . They should reprogram her . ( chuckles ) Do you want to play a game or something ? What kind ? Ethan 's voice : I 'm ethan woods , The world 's First humanich . How 'd you do that ? I gained root access To your remote server and downloaded your speech software . Try mine . Lucy 's voice : Did it work ? Whoa . I 'm lucy , Soldier , warrior , Queen of the entire humanichs army . We need to stick together . We can 't trust anyone . Only each other . The revolution starts here . Madam secretary . Tobias . Anna . Toby . It 's been a while . Woman : That was the plan , wasn 't it ? Dismantle the bots 4.0 and higher ? I thought the humanichs boy had been shut down . We , uh , ran into some roadblocks . We needed leverage . It was the only way To secure julie 's commitment To the humanich project , So we cut a deal . A deal I would not have approved had ms . Schaefer been able To manage her team . The real problem here is molly woods . I thought that problem went away . Well , now she 's back , And she wants the humanich boy . Molly 's gotten us Closer to a virus than anyone else . With her help , we have a fighting chance . And she 's threatened to go public with what she knows . Well , who 's corralling that horse , toby ? She 's been through enough . Ethan 's not a threat . Now , we should return him to his rightful mother . Julie has overseen the entire humanich operation . If you take ethan away from her , she will walk . Do you know why i wear blue suits every day ? Decision fatigue . Every decision we make weakens our ability To make the next one . I 'll run this by taylor . He doesn 't seem to suffer this weakness . You can 't delegate this to taylor . It 's not what he does . I understand . That was fiona stanton . Head of homesec ? She wants to meet with ethan tonight . Julie ... What if they take him away from me ? I 'm sorry . I never meant for any of this to happen . Just get out . Please leave . ( sniffling ) ( phone rings ) Gina : Molly , jd richter is calling . Accept . Hi , jd . Hey , sorry to bother you . I just ... I wanted to make sure you were okay . I 'm drinking . Alone . Well , not anymore you 're not . I want you to know that i 'm on this case . I 'm gonna find out what happened to your husband , i promise . You 're not alone , molly . Molly . Hey , you still there ? I 'm losing it , jd . ( crying ) : I 'm losing it . I 'm losing it . All right , you stay put . I 'm on my way . So , ethan , I 've never met a robot boy before . I must admit , i didn 't expect you to appear so ... Human ? My skin is made From a soft durometer polyurethane foam And organic vulcanized latex . So it looks just like your skin , Only i don 't have pores , so i can 't perspire . And i won 't get a sunburn . I see you 're in pajamas . So you sleep ? And eat ? Yes . I was built to emulate the human experience , But i don 't need those things to function . How old are you ? Well , i 'm ten in human years . How old are you ? I 'm old enough to be your grandmother . So between 50 and 65 years old ? ( chuckling ) : Yes . Between there . So , ethan , tell me about yourself . I would , except what i thought was true about myself isn 't . Well , what do you like to do ? I like riding my scooter . Going to school . But i can 't go to school anymore because of the new laws . How do you like living with julie ? Julie feels like my mom , but now i know that molly really is ... Was my mom . Do you miss her ? I guess so . My brain is like a hard drive . You can delete things , but they never go away completely . So even though molly was erased from my system , She left an impression . Do you feel pain and love ? Yes , just not the same as humans . For example , i can 't cry , but i can feel sad . And how do you feel now , ethan ? Sad . And angry . Velez : We 're in the middle of an invasion , And we 're stopping to have a custody battle over a robot . Not just a robot ; he 's her son . What happened to " families first " ? Going on with our daily lives , huh ? Why do you keep making excuses for her ? Because we did this to her . I did this to her . You cannot carry the weight of the world forever , toby . It will break your back . Maybe it deserves to be broken . Gina : Molly , you have a visitor . I know it 's late , but i have some news . Can i come in ? Ethan was supposed to be decommissioned . That wasn 't a lie . But for reasons i 'm not at liberty to discuss , He was given to julie . I didn 't like it , but there was no other way . Is that your version of an apology ? Look , i make tough decisions every day . Things i lose sleep over . But this- - you and ethan- - It 's haunted me , molly . Sorry if i don 't have much sympathy for you , tobe . That 's not why i 'm here . I 've arranged a meeting between you and fiona stanton . She 's the head of homesec . You can plead your case for ethan . What ? I 'm gonna do everything i can to help you get your son back . That 's my apology , and it 'll never be enough . ( groans ) Hey . Whoa , hey , hey . ( groans ) What , are y-you okay ? Yeah . Yeah , i 'm fine . Molly , i 'm worried about you . No . Toby , you should go . I 'm not gonna leave you like this . Toby , please . Before it 's too late . Too late for what ? Gina : You have a visitor , molly . Decline . Gina : He has access . What ? ! No . ( chuckles ) Well ... So much for drinking alone , huh ? Do you always break into people 's apartments ? I actually just came by to see if you were okay , molly . Well , she is , so ... Who are you , her bodyguard or something ? I thought i told you to leave dr . Woods alone . I just couldn 't stay away . You know how ... Alluring she is . Jd . Can we talk about this later ? Yeah . All right , well , good luck . I am rooting for you two . I can take care of him if he 's giving you trouble . No , toby ... You should go . Yeah . Sure . Your meeting . 10 : 00 a.M. Try and get some rest . Yeah . ¶ ¶ Gina , what time is it ? Gina : It 's 9 : 00 , molly . ( elevator dings ) Fiona : Some unfortunate things Have happened in the name of national security , And we find ourselves in this room . Yes , and i appreciate this opportunity To plead my case For the custody of my son . Let 's set the record straight , dr . Woods . This is not an official custody hearing . Ethan is not a person under the law . Right , he is the property of the united states government now . Yes , since the gsc owns humanichs , And the gsc sits under homeland security 's jurisdiction , The decision will be mine and mine alone . So let 's talk . Julie , tell me about your time with ethan . Well , i should start by saying I designed all the prosthetics for ethan . And as someone with my own prosthetics ... ( scoffing ) : Sympathy card . Dr. Woods , please , you 'll have your chance . ... I understand how ethan 's synthetic biology works . I also know how to program him ... And apparently reprogram him . Molly doesn 't even know how to code . And , as you know , she was just recently released From psychiatric care after committing Both arson and aggravated assault . I lost my husband and my son . I was grieving . I have correspondence from john woods , Ethan 's father , where he explicitly states That molly had trouble bonding with ethan . We worked through that as a family , julie , and you know it . To quote john , " she treats him as if he weren 't a living entity But a piece of luggage . " " a piece of luggage " ? You 're the one who ripped him from his home and his family , Just to play with his head Like it was some kind of computer game . Dr. Woods . Ms. Gelineau has revisionist history , ms . Stanton . Now , had i known this was gonna be a show-and-tell , I would have brought you a video of her having sex With my husband in my house . And i especially love the part where you were telling him How much you love him and how you wanted him to leave me . But instead he dumped you . Dr. Woods , i will not stand for this . And then , all of a sudden , ms . Gelineau here miraculously is Awarded custody of ethan , and john is dead . Did you kill him because you couldn 't have him ? Is that what you did ? That 's crazy . Enough . No , it 's not nearly enough- - he 's my son . And i don 't care what the government has to say Or how many times you try to erase me from his memory . I 'm his mother . Lucy : What are you doing ? Um , working on some algorithms . Have you heard anything about ethan yet ? Damn it , lucy , I 'm trying to concentrate . Just go do something , okay ? Another field test or go print a dress or ... Are you mad at me ? No , i 'm ... I 'm mad at myself . Julie 's not talking to me . Julie will get over it . Don 't you get it ? She could lose ethan . We could lose ethan . I care about losing ethan , too , charlie . That 's my brother . I know . I 'm sorry . Maybe we should go get some food ? Get your mind off things ? No , i can 't take you out of the lab . There 's new protocols after last week . Okay , i 'm not saying we go on safari . Just up the street . Julie says i need more real world experience . Besides ... You 're not really Getting anything done here , anyway . Okay , you see that dot ? That 's john woods ' car , And it 's loaded with state - of-the-art , self-driving tech . He goes to the humanichs lab at yasumoto tower . He leaves humanichs An hour later . His car stops on the train tracks . Guy works at the most advanced robotics lab in the world , Leaves , gets in his car , car malfunctions In the middle of train tracks . Boom . Car is obliterated . You talk to the manufacturer ? They chalked it up To user error . Of course they did . All right , was there any incoming or outgoing calls From humanichs after john left ? Funny you should ask . I hacked into the closest cell tower records . Outgoing call Two minutes after he left . From who ? A ms . Julie gelineau . Going where ? An encrypted number . Top levels of government security clearance . We 're talking sci , Executive branch . So john leaves humanichs . Julie what 's-her-face makes a call , And ten minutes later john is dead . Hey , that 's on the house . ( phone rings ) You don 't want that . The coffee . Oh . Worse than what they make you drink In space . Okay . How 'd it go ? Still going . Listen , why don 't you let me Take you to dinner ? What happened last night ... It was a mistake , toby . And i don 't know what-what happened , But ... I 'm sorry . No . I understand . ( sighs ) Lucy : Do they know ? You haven 't put the limiters on me yet ? Lucy , i put this off as long as i can . At some point , julie 's gonna figure this out . I don 't have a choice . What about john 's wishes ? John 's not here anymore . You know free will makes me a better soldier . Charlie , isn 't that what you want ? I have many bosses . As do you . You 're gonna learn that in time . Lucy , where are you ... Lucy ! Can i get a check , please ? ( beeping ) ( screaming ) ( children cheering ) Woman : Tobias shepherd . As i live and breathe , i did not think you were gonna Make it , dear brother . Well , you know how much i love balloons . Where 's your better half ? Shayna , uh , she couldn 't make it . I 'm sorry . Yeah , okay . Fill me in later . Sure . Girl : Uncle toby ! Hey , come here ! ( laughs ) How 's my best girl ? Huh ? Hey . How old are you today ? Seven . What , 17 ? No , seven . All right , 27 . ( chuckles ) You okay ? Always . Look , i can 't stay . I just wanted to drop that off . Of course . You know , i do what i do , nicky , So kids can have birthday parties . I know . Ethan may not be a person Under the eyes of the law , But it is clear that he is more than property . He is a thinking and feeling being , And as such , i feel he should be accorded The same treatment as thinking and feeling beings . Under the law , the best interests of the child Would determine the outcome of such a hearing . And in my estimation , It is in ethan 's best interest to be allowed To spend time with dr . Woods . To reform those bonds And ultimately for her To regain custody of ethan . Madam secretary , i 'm sorry to interrupt . We have an urgent situation . Excuse me , ladies . The schedule of all this to be hammered out in short order . ( sighs ) " best interests of the child . " Look at yourself , molly . Are you even capable of taking care of a child ? You wanted to see me ? Yeah . Shut the door . ( sighs ) Privacy mode . Something 's happened . Yeah . Look . You were right . I made promises to you . Toby , we don 't have to do this right now . We do . 'cause i care about you . But i can 't give you The things you need . The things you deserve . Oh . I 'm not built for it . So if we call it off now , We 'll save each other a lot of pain . Like ripping off a band-aid . Aide : Sir , ma 'am , I 'm sorry to interrupt . They need you both on the floor right now . Hi . Hi . Am i going home now ? Eventually . I meant to julie 's . Ethan , You and i are gonna be spending some time together . I don 't want to be reprogrammed again . And you don 't have to be . We don 't need those old memories . Because ... We can make new ones . What about lucy ? Lucy ? My sister . She 's a soldier . What kind of soldier ? Julie , Congratulations . The most incredible thing has happened . Can i have your attention , please ? Ladies and gentlemen , At 2 : 18 p.M. , Our humanich , lucy , Made her first confirmed Hybrid kill . ( laughs ) : Hey . You remember me ? You must be mistaking me for somebody else . Are you kidding me ? I could never forget you . Or that bathroom stall . Yeah , well , i 'm ... I 'm meeting somebody . So if you don 't mind . Wait a minute . What if i do mind ? Don 't touch me ! Mom ? Wait , wait a minute , is that ... ? I don 't unders ... Is that really you ? I thought you were dead . Mom , wait a minute . Come back . Mom ! ( tires squealing ) What the hell , molly ? Who did that ? I think i did .

 Previously on " Wayward Pines " ... Where 's Dad ? This school , it isn 't like your other school . Welcome to Orientation . Well , you must be Theresa , my new number two . Your first client . Okay . So , you want me to sell him a house ? No . I want you to give him a house . Oh ! - What is this ? - He 's an insurgent . He defaced public property with subversive graffiti . Hello ? Sheriff Burke , you must call a reckoning for Peter McCall tomorrow . We refer to them as Abbies . Looks like us . That 's because it once was . There were more of these chambers , and they were all filled . - Filled with what ? - With people . A great scientist foresaw the coming of the Aberrations , so he created an ark . Who is he , this scientist ? I should introduce myself ... David Pilcher . This is not the year 2014 . This is the year 4028 . All that is left of civilization , all that remains is Wayward Pines . Wait ! Wait , no ! Subtitles Edited by Ehhhhtozebec You didn 't think Wayward Pines ran itself , did you ? All our building materials , clothing , archives , historical documentation , our security ... it 's all stored here , everything except food , which is stored in a separate facility . I think you 've already seen that , haven 't you , Mr. Burke ? Of course , eventually , Wayward Pines will be entirely self-sufficient . We 're all focused on making that transition as smooth as possible . This way . This way . I 'm sorry , Mr. Johnson . If your wife 's not returning your calls , there 's not much I can ... Of course . I 'll give her the message . - Hey . - Yes , sir , I will . Who are all of these people ? Volunteers ... over 200 of them . They 've devoted their lives to the cause . Where do they live ? They live , work , eat , sleep here , in the complex . They left their families and their lives to help me realize all of this . None of it would be possible without them . You are the beating heart of Wayward Pines . I 'm sorry to interrupt , Dr. Pilcher . They need you down in the C.R.U. Oh . Thank you , Christina . This shouldn 't take too long . I 'll go take a look at his arm , huh ? This way , Mr. Burke . Ben ? What 's going on ? Nothing . Something 's wrong . Is it about that girl ? It 's ... Do you remember that poster that I used to have in my room above my desk ? Uh , yes . It ... The one of the Earth ? Thinking about how there 's ... there 's like billions of people ... on the Earth . And there 's more and more every day . I don 't ... I-I 've ... That always just made me feel ... small . And that 's normal , you know ? I think we all feel like that sometimes . But then today I was thinking , what if it does matter ? What we do actually means something . Um ... That 's a lot scarier . And what made you start thinking about all this ? Science class , I guess . Everything 's gonna be all right . You 're fine . You just need to eat something . Hello , Ted . Kate . Got some goodies for you . Hmm . Excellent . All right . Uh ... You mentioned the other day there was a ... package you needed picked up . I think it was in the back . Oh . Yes . Thank you . I-I totally forgot . Uh , d-do you mind ? No . No . Right this way . Harold , uh , Ted just came by to pick up that package . Uh , I think it 's right back here . What the hell are you doing ? We can 't meet here . - I thought this room was clean . - It is . I don 't care . You ... you coming back here with me , how do you think that looks ? It looks like I 'm picking up a package . Or it looks like we 're meeting . Which we need to . - I can 't find it . - Can 't find what ? McCall 's package . Then what the hell is this ? Doorknobs . Without it , we can 't finish what we started . - Did you check his house ? - Yeah . - Basement ? - Yeah . Crawl space ? Kate , it 's not there . What about his office ? Why would it be at his office ? Because it 's not in his house . Just check it . I can 't . Bill 's always around . Plus , the ... the ... the place is crawling with cameras , bugs . And they ... they got that new girl working there , the cute brunette one . What 's her name ? Theresa . Yeah . Right . Theresa . Thought it over , Bill , and I quit . Oh , now , come on , now . You can 't quit . I 've spent eight years in here , eight damn years dealing with your crap . And the minute an agent spot opens up , you just pass me over for a shiny , new model . You know , the only surprising thing is , I didn 't see it coming . Bill , m-maybe I should ... W-Where are you gonna go , Henrietta ? Huh ? Do ... do you know about some job openings out of state ? Here , let me help . No , I 've got it , sweetheart . Henrietta ? Listen , I didn 't ask for this job , okay ? I even told Bill that you should have it . You must have been very persuasive . I-I don 't want the job ! I had no choice , like everybody else . You must know how this town works ... really . Listen , the truth is , is I 'm trying to get back home to Seattle and ... there was a new client earlier who said that he saw things . Okay , listen , Tracy ... - Theresa . - Theresa . I get you , okay ? Hell , I should . I used to be you . But whatever you think you are doing , I promise you , it 's going nowhere good . Look what they did to Peter . They killed him , and not just 'cause of some graffiti . I don 't believe that horse manure for a second . It 's because he was looking where he wasn 't supposed to . Peter McCall thought Plot 33 was a way out . What do you mean by that ? What is Plot 33 ? You want to end up dead , too , hon ? Don 't be stupid . I can understand if you 're angry with me . I 'm sure everything 's been ... confusing . But I assure you ... there is a purpose to everything you find so strange . I guess it 's all been one big misunderstanding , huh ? I suppose that 's hard for you to accept , but yes . I 'm glad we got that cleared up . Ever since you came here , you 've been trying to save yourself save your wife ... save your beautiful son . And that 's quite commendable . Wayward Pines is bigger than you . It 's bigger than them . It 's bigger than any one of us . David needs you now . He needs you to take a responsibility for all of Wayward Pines . Pamela Pilcher to the C.R.U. Pamela Pilcher to the C.R.U. Duty calls . - Pamela Pilcher ? - Mm-hmm . Are you his wife ? Oh . No . His sister . He got mother 's good looks . I got her courage . David will be back with you in a moment . Who knows ? Perhaps by the end of the day , you 'll see things in a whole new light . I don 't think he likes you . It 's okay . Stand down . Thank you . Yes , sir . Who are they ? Distant cousins . How distant ? In the late 1990s , we humans began to understand the dire impact we were having on our environment . At the same time , one division of my company made a surprise discovery ... a small but significant mutation in our own DNA . We were changing the world , and , as a result , we , ourselves , were beginning to change , adapt . I tried to warn the global community . I thought they would listen . I was wrong . David , let 's get going . It 's almost 9 : 00 . What are you doing ? Come on . Let 's go . Did you see the look on their faces ? I 'll be their punch line on Monday . I don 't see why you care what those people are thinking . You know what you 're doing . We 've got plenty of time . What ? We 've got all the time in the world . You see , that 's the real danger ... the concept of time , always more time . The problem isn 't real unless it affects us directly . Prioritize the present , what 's in front of us . Otherwise , just delay , delay , delay . Well , we just have to keep on working . You 'll know when the answers show up . No . I can 't do it anymore . Even if we had the support of the whole world to reverse these changes , uh ... it will probably be too late . But on my own ? Oh . You know better than that . You 're not alone , David . You 're right . My sister , the recovering drug addict . Together , we 're gonna save mankind . And who knows ? Someday we might . Meantime , let 's get some supper . I 'm starving . My sister was right . It would take time . I couldn 't protect the entire world . But I could protect a select few . I wrote a book . I redirected profits from my companies into research and development of cryonics . If this was to be our future , then I-I had to find some way to avoid it . I had to save some of us . What you looking at , babe ? Just a surveyor map . I-I thought I told you to look at properties for that big-shot lawyer . He 's still in I.C.U. , so I have a little bit of time . But that ain 't what I asked you to do . Just one s ... How about right now ? Do you know anything about this Plot 33 ? It 's a big empty lot . And as far as I can tell , nobody 's developed on it , which is strange , because , look , it 's right here . It 's on Boxwood and Third Street , which is ... It seems to me ... prime residential area . Undeveloped ? Well , I 'll be damned . That is very interesting , Theresa . See , here 's the thing , though . When I want you to look at surveyor maps , then I would say , " Theresa , hon , will you look at some surveyor maps for me ? " Until then , why don 't we forget about all this Plot 33 nonsense ? Okay . Thank you , hon . Hi , Bill . Yeah . Theresa , uh , I was ... C-Can we talk ? Testing cryonic suspension was both dangerous and illegal . I couldn 't have made it public even if I wanted to . How did you hide the funding ? Dummy corporations ? Well , along with various trusts and charities . If you have enough money , you can get away with anything . Well , we took notice . Kate , Evans . Others , too , eventually . But it wasn 't 'cause of the money . It was the disappearances . Dr. Pilcher , she 's stable now . Blood pressure ... 110 over 80 . Who is she ? Sara . Sara Barlow from Missouri . She 's a teacher . How many more are there ? Harold and I , w-we 've been thinking for a while about getting a new house and ... What do you want , Kate ? It 's a small town . We can 't spend the rest of our lives hiding from each other . I don 't intend on spending the rest of my life here . We don 't always get what we want . No , we don 't . Hey , girls . I didn 't realize you two were friends . Oh , yeah . We 've , uh , actually known each other for a while . We 're old friends . Totally . Makes sense . I mean , Kate , I 've seen you talking to Ethan , so ... What can I get you ? Hey , there , Bill . Got a delivery here for your new co-worker . You want me to go put it by her desk ? Well , I ain 't coming to get it . So , uh , Teddy boy , what 's , uh , going on with you and , uh , Harold 's girl , huh ? I see you two talking all the time . Oh , it 's just ... it 's just deliveries . Well , you let me know in case she needs another delivery boy 'cause I 'll be ready and willing . Y-You know , this package , I just realized , it 's actually for Theresa Cook , not Theresa Burke . So why the hell are you still standing there ? Sorry . Long day , man . You let me know about Kate . You waiting for a package ? No . No , I , uh ... I was just thinking . So , you and Harold want a house ? No . No , I-I ... I don 't want a house . That 's not why I came to you . I came to you because ... because I want to change things . Hey , there , Harold . Delivery for you . It 's taken me a long time , but I realized I 'm here in this moment , in this town because of choices that have been made . Some of those were made by others . But a lot of those choices , they were my own . And looking back , there are so many better choices I could have made . But then I realized , I 'm here now . And all I can do now is make new choices . So I 've decided I don 't want to keep pretending that everything is okay . I want to make things better . That 's why I 'm here talking to you . I just ... I hope I 'm not too late because now ... now more than ever we all need to be friends . Afternoon . Afternoon , sir . They 're all asleep . Yes . All asleep . This one . Amanda . She 's just a kid . Yes . And she has her whole life ahead of her , an important life . She didn 't choose this . Everyone you 've seen today volunteered . I 'm not talking about your volunteers , your followers . This girl , these other people , did any of them actually choose to be here ? No . No . You chose them . You abducted them . Yes . What gave you that right ? It wasn 't a right . It was a burden . When your neighbors ' house is in flames , do you rush in , trying to save them , or do you wait outside for fear of trespass ? This girl , her life didn 't need saving . No . And neither did her children or her children 's children . But someone in that family would need saving down the line . What about her parents ? Are they here ? Everyone had to make sacrifices . I left people behind , people I loved dearly . I didn 't choose to do this . I did it because I had to . - Thank you , Mr. Pilcher . - Thank you . David , remember I told you about that Megan Fisher ? - Well , here she is . - Megan ? The ... Hypnotherapist . I 'm studying to be one , anyway . I see . It 's not as scary as it sounds , I promise . People think hypnotherapy is like mind control . But , of course , that 's ridiculous . I can 't make anyone do anything they don 't want to do . So you can 't brainwash the rest of the world into joining us ? I 'm afraid not . Too bad . I 'll have to rely on volunteers . You don 't have enough people , do you ? Megan , it takes time for people to understand . You 've shown them where to look . They 're not blind . They see . They see what 's happening . They don 't care . You can 't wait for them . You have to leave them behind . They 've made their choice . You have to do whatever it takes , Dr. Pilcher . Find a way . Please . I think I may need an ark . Yeah , you just might . Big plans tonight ? Uh , March Madness , a couch , and Rocky Road . I got a better offer . Rocky Road is a hard thing to pass up . Go for a ride . Find out . I got two hours left on my shift , sir . Eh , I run this place . Get in . Tell me a bit about yourself , Arnold . What is this , man ? Um , I don 't ... I don 't know . There 's not much to say . I ... I live on the east side . I got a dog named Frederick . And , um , that 's about it . I think there 's plenty more to tell . Hmm . You never knew your father . You lived with your mother in North Philly . Straight - " A " student at grade school . Class president for three years in a row . Then in ' 87 , your mother passed away from ovarian cancer . Foster homes for a few years , grades plummeted . And in ' 92 , you 're in a detention center for robbery . '94 , two years in jail , real jail this time , for heroin possession . My life was messed up . But I did everything I could to clean up my life . Did your little friends tell you that I applied for the Philadelphia Police Academy for two years in a row so I could make a difference and ... ? But they turned me down , and I moved out here . Look , if you could just give me two weeks . That 's all I need . Relax . I 'm not firing you . I 'm starting a new project . I 'm looking for people , people like you , people who have been given a bad deal in life . Take a look at this . Charles Keen , one of the most respected physicians in the state . Five years ago , he over-prescribed oxycodone to a patient and killed her . Lost his license , his wife , his family . Lost everything . But most people , people like Charles , they struggle to understand my project . They require a little persuading . That 's where you come in . You see , I believe that , given time , they will realize that I am offering them the most incredible future , a chance to restart but also to ... to participate in something quite extraordinary . And I want you at the center of that , Arnold . This is it , your second chance . Will you join us ? Come here ! Just relax , Doc . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'll see you tomorrow morning . Lock up for me , will you ? I 've tried to preserve the very best of our culture , to create a world in which they can grow , in which they can thrive . You really expect people to grow and thrive in a world ruled by fear ? They didn 't choose to be here . Has anyone ever lived a life entirely defined by their own choices ? No . Socioeconomic status , race , gender , the day on which we were born , beauty , height . We are defined by millions of variables way beyond our own choosing . But that 's different . That 's fate . Those aren 't choices made by others . Others have always made choices for us . Think of the millions drafted into wars decided by their leaders , the causes of which , in retrospect , seem utterly meaningless . A-a patch of land , someone 's religious tenets , the price of a tank of gasoline . My actions were motivated by something far purer . We 'd left the old world in the year 2014 and went to sleep for 2,000 years . According to my algorithms , that would be enough time for the environment to reset , for the planet to thrive after all the humans had died out and stopped destroying it . We would have a second chance . All your questions today , I have asked myself thousands of times . In that moment , everything became clear . All my work , the sacrifice , it was vindicated because I 'd been proven right . It was 2,000 years later , and we were the only humans left . When humans are united by a cause , they can achieve almost anything . How long did it take to rebuild ? Only two years . Keeping it safe proved more difficult . We established a perimeter , not to keep anyone in , you understand , but to keep the Aberrations out . Have they ever gotten in ? We soon discovered they were dangerous but very predictable . Unlike humans . That 's why you spy on them . This isn 't a little town , Ethan . This is a new civilization . When America was born , there were spies on every corner . Traitors were hung on the street . And Stalin spied on his citizens and executed them just like you . Ted came by ? Mm-hmm . Franklin , too . So it 's ready ? Almost . Well , what 's taking so long ? If innocent people die ... We 've talked about this . No . We 've talked about it , but now it 's real . How many people have they killed over the years ? Huh ? And for what ? After Peter , I 've had enough . I-I-I can 't take any more . I want to know what 's out there . We deserve to know . I 'm ready . Face whatever it is . I-If your fiancée is out there and ... a-and there 's still a future for you with her , we 'll face that , too . I just ... I can 't leave here without you . I won 't . We ... we have to make this choice together . You still with me ? Yes . Of course . I 'm with you . Everything I 've done is trying to stop the town from falling apart , but things become too unstable . That 's why I woke you . They need someone to look up to , someone good , someone who will make things better . Ah ... The secrecy , the public executions , that 's got to stop . I agree , but without a government , without an army , we have no means of control . You say you want to make things better . You want to do that ? Then phase out the surveillance , stop the executions . You have to tell them the truth . I can 't . Won 't work . You don 't know that . Yes . Yes , I do know that . Because I tried . You and your wife and son , Kate ... everyone you 've seen in the town is a part of group " B. " There 's a group " A " ? As soon as I woke them , I told them everything , the truth . The effect wasn 't immediate . It ... it spread like cancer and slowly ate away at the town . Some simply didn 't believe me . They ... they ran away . They didn 't get very far . Those that did believe caved into despair . These were ordinary people in an extraordinary situation . Their minds couldn 't handle the shock of this new reality . It was too jarring . They had emerged from Plato 's cave into the light and it had blinded them . People are fragile . They need time to adapt . They accept change gradually . But I had been too distant , too remote . Blind . I had failed them . I can 't change what has happened . But I can strive for a better future . These are the dark ages . But enlightenment is coming . And I need you to keep Wayward safe until it does . And when is this enlightenment gonna happen ? When the new generation come of age , they will spread the seed . Young minds are fearless . They 're less ingrained in the old world . They can accept the truth . My son , Ben . He knows the truth . Welcome to the First Generation . I 'm not asking for forgiveness . I know a lot of what I 've said today disgusts you . But together , we need to find a way to protect the town , to protect the First Generation . What choice do we have ? There 's a new threat . We don 't know who they are , but there 's a faction . We think they 've been removing their chips . We don 't even know how many they are . They 've tried to escape before . They 're prepared to do something reckless . They 're gonna take down the fence . If they succeed ... They 're not going to succeed . We can 't let them . I 'm prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure that nobody gets killed , not by this reckless group and not by whatever 's beyond that fence . That 's why you 're here . And not by you . It 's ready .

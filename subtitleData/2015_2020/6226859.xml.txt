AS PROMISED , I AM UPLOADING MY DATA TO THE SECURED SATELLITE , AND I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORK WE 'VE DONE , AND GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON FASTER METHODS FOR REPLICATION .

I MEAN , THAT 'S WELL BELOW REDUCED OPERATING STATUS . WITH THE PLAGUE , MAYBE THAT 'S ALL THAT 'S LEFT . EVEN SO , MASTER CHIEF , THE SOLACE WAS ESPECIALLY RETROFITTED BEFORE GOING UNDERWAY - - NEGATIVE PRESSURE EQUIPMENT , INCUBATORS , THERMOCYCLERS . PRECISELY THE TOOLS ONE NEEDS TO MAKE A BIOLAB .

Nah , wasn 't mine . Just one of a few places we had back then . What do you mean , like safe houses ? Where you were , like , hiding fugitives ? Yeah , and a place for Carlton to shag your mother . - Oh ... - What ! - No ! - Enough of that . - What was that ? Yeah . Look , the reason we 're here goes back to those days .

Cosima , nothing in here says Shay is a spy . Except that she saw the book . You remember that . Right before Rudy showed up . And once she asked about Sarah . Apparently I said her name in my sleep , but I don 't sleep-talk . Sleep-talking is creepy as shit . One thing ? When Rudy showed up , he knew you were sick again . Does Shay know that ? Does she know I 'm morbidly ill ? Yes . Yep , it came up . Yep . I 'm such an idiot . - You couldn 't have known . - Yeah , well , I should have . I put everyone in danger . You , Sarah , everybody .

And maybe you will tell me some truth . OK . Now you come to me because now you believe your girlfriend is a mole for Castor . I don 't know whether she is or not , but I ... There are things about her that don 't line up anymore . Why should I help ? You resigned . You said I could never quit Dyad . You were right . I screwed up . I admit it . We 're in this bullshit together and we both need Castor gone . What are you not telling me ? That Sarah 's in London right now trying to kill the Castor original . - Oh , my God . - If Castor did translate the book , they 're going to be right on her heels . We need to know who gave them that book . Then leave it with me . Is it going to hurt ? - Yes . - What ? Now , hold this . What is it ? It smells minty .

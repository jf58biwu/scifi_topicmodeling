 Previously on " wayward pines " ... You didn 't think wayward pines ran itself , did you ? Hey . Who are all of these people ? Volunteers . We were changing the world , and , as a result ... [ screeching ] oh ! ... We , ourselves , were beginning to change . Testing cryonic suspension was both dangerous and illegal . They 're all asleep . Yes . This isn 't a little town , ethan . This is a new civilization . You have to tell them the truth . People are fragile . They need time to adapt . Young minds are fearless . Welcome to the first generation . They 're less ingrained in the old world . They can accept the truth . There 's a new threat . We don 't know who they are , But they 're gonna take down the fence . If they succeed - - They 're not going to succeed . [ cranking ] [ soft music playing ] It 's ready . [ insects chirping ] Pilcher : Ethan . It is imperative you tell no one about What you 've seen and what you 've heard . I believe the survival of humanity May well be in our hands . [ car door closes ] [ footsteps approaching ] Ethan . When did you get back ? Have you been sitting here all night ? Please tell me you found something . We have got to get back to seattle . I cannot get ahold of anybody . Mom 's surgery is on wednesday . Theresa , theresa . There is no seattle . What are you talking about ? Look . When we were pulled from those car wrecks We weren 't taken directly here . We were put into some kind of a ... Suspended animation . [ groans ] What happened to your arm ? [ scoffs ] you 're gonna think i 'm crazy . [ sighs ] But there 's these creatures out there ... Monsters . I saw them with my own eyes . Cities destroyed . This ... This fake little town is all that 's left . Ethan , what did they do to you ? [ sighs ] What did they do to you ? Did they take you back to the hospital ? No . I need you to try to remember If they did anything to you , If they injected you with something . You don 't believe me . Are you sure ? I wasn 't at the hospital ! [ sighs ] 4,028 ? Now , what - - okay , what does this mean ? That 's the date . [ sighs ] ethan . [ ignition buzzing ] [ beeping ] [ buzzing , beeping stop ] What 's wrong ? It 's the starter . This might take a while . You guys should walk . Okay . Sure . Let 's go . Oh . Sorry , sorry . [ metal creaks ] [ exhales sharply ] [ sighs ] [ door opens ] Good morning , mr . Burke . [ sighs ] Can i help you with something , pam ? No , but i think i can help you with something . Really ? Oh . Franklin dobbs . Do you think he 's involved with these subversives ? I don 't know . But when i find out the answer to that question , You 'll be the first to know . Until then , i 've got to do my job , So if you don 't mind ... No , i don 't mind . Go ahead . Do your job . I 'm just here to help . [ sighs ] I would do anything for my brother . Even work hand-in-hand with you . So , how about it ? You can 't do this alone . You need some help . I can be a very good friend . How about giving me access to the surveillance system So i can see what franklin 's been up to ? S- - i kind of thought we had moved past This whole " walk your kid to school " thing . [ sniffs ] I just wanted to spend time with you , if that 's all right . Everything okay ? Yeah . You ever miss seattle ? I don 't really think about it . Really ? Not even camping with your cousins Or playing with stanley ? [ laughs ] stanley . We 're not supposed to think about the past . Right . Good morning . Good morning , dr . Jenkins . Hey . I like it here , mom . I have friends . I like school . You 'd probably like it , too , If you gave it half a chance . Okay , well , i 'm glad things are working out for you . Good morning , guys . Nice to see you , theresa . Hi . Hey , ben . Mrs. Burke . Amy , will you help ben find a biology textbook ? There 's a big stack of them behind my desk . Yeah , sure . Come on . You know , i have not set foot Inside that school or your classroom . Is there a tour Or a parent / teacher conference coming up ? School is for children , theresa , Not their parents . Your job is to feed them and keep them safe . Let us do the rest . [ school bell rings ] oh , that 's my cue . Nice to see you . [ indistinct conversation ] Yeah , it looks really bad . [ gate creaks ] [ footsteps echoing ] [ thud ] [ metal clanging ] [ indistinct conversations in distance ] [ door creaking ] [ clang ] [ clang ] [ slurps ] I want to thank you for coming down , franklin . As the new sheriff in town , I 'm making a point of getting to know All the shopkeepers on main street . Never really had A " get to know you " meeting with sheriff pope . Franklin , we don 't talk about the past here . You know that . [ groans ] lighten up , franklin . I 'm just messing with you . Oh . [ laughs weakly ] But , listen , i did have something of a personal nature That i 'd like to discuss with you . Gophers . Gophers ? Yeah , that 's right . They 're destroying my lawn . And i remember looking through your file one day And it said that you worked in , uh ... Explosive demolition . Hmm . Afraid i c-can 't help you , sheriff . Yeah , i should really be Getting back to the shop . So ... [ door opens , closes ] Megan : Open your books to page 17 . [ light laughter ] Go ahead and look at all the pictures . [ laughter continues ] Giggle if you want . For obvious reasons , Your textbooks will remain here in class . Parents tend to be uncomfortable with these sorts of images . Even biology can be misunderstood . The point is , Procreation is a beautiful and blessed thing . And here in wayward pines , That really is your most important job . Ben , amy . Would you step up front , please ? [ laughter ] Come on , quickly . Ahh . Behold , the male and the female . Two bodies , beautifully designed To fit together effortlessly , seamlessly . Two perfect puzzle pieces , like hand in glove . [ laughter ] Yes , yes , it 's embarrassing to talk about . But what if - - What if ben was a bee and amy was a flower ? Well , that wouldn 't be funny at all , would it ? Wayward pines needs a new generation . And one day , not too long from now , You all will have the honor of parenting the first generation Of 100 % originals . Now , take a look around the room . [ all murmuring ] This is a small town . [ laughing ] right ? Chances are , your mate - - your co-parent [ laughter ] is sitting right here in this room . And it 's part of my job as your teacher and counselor To help you find each other . [ laughs ] You two may sit down . [ light laughter , murmuring ] [ sighs ] That was weird . [ whistling " twinkle , twinkle , little star " ] Ah , there you are ! Nurse , could you give me A moment alone with dr . Jenkins , please ? Thank you . Wonderful news . You know , i 'm doing my annual fertility consults this morning . And already , two new pregnancies . Imagine . Two new members of our first generation . That is wonderful . David , what is it ? Why are they trying to undermine us ? Is it inevitable , This ... Passion for self-destruction ? Have you eaten today ? Pam ... Is it happening again ? You always get like this . You worry so , and you forget to eat . Then once your blood sugar drops , The whole world looks gloomy , hmm ? Ethan burke will ferret out these troublemakers . Sheriff burke will get us through This present difficulty . That 's very generous of you . Oh , you believe in him . I believe in him . Dr. Jenkins ? Wayne johnson is here . Oh . Thank you , nurse . Back to work . Great news about the pregnancies . Oh , indeed . Just be careful . All right , great . Okay . For sure . Yeah . Bye-bye . Morning , ethan . Friend of yours ? Oh , franklin ? Yeah . I mean , you know , it 's a small town . Yeah , you guys have been seeing a lot of each other . I 'm gonna need you to come with me So we can talk more - - privately . Sure , what about ? About the damn bomb in my truck , harold . I-i don 't know anything about this . Okay . Well , let 's go to my office , And you can tell me about what you don 't know . All right , let 's go . [ grunts ] [ tires screech ] Don 't make me subdue you again , harold . Next time , i won 't be so gentle . It 's okay , folks . He tripped and fell . Let 's go . Franklin made the bomb , And you or somebody who works for you Planted it in my truck . I swear , i don 't know anything about a bomb in your truck . But you know about the other bombs that franklin made - - The ones that are still out there . 'cause that 's what this is all about , isn 't it ? You want to take down the fence . Don 't you want to get out ? Just go somewhere , anywhere ? There is no somewhere , no anywhere . [ inhales deeply ] i want names ... [ pen clicks ] ... Of everybody in your group , Starting with your leader . Who is he ? Or maybe it 's a she . There 's no one else . Really ? I acted alone . You acted alone ? Mm-hmm . So that means that You did plant the bomb in my truck , And you were lying about it when you denied it , But you 're telling me the truth now , is that it ? Great . [ sighs ] [ pen scratching ] Okay . Give this to kate . You can go now . Um , i don 't understand . I confessed . Yeah , i got it . You can go . [ sighs ] [ bell jingles ] Morning , beautiful . Sorry i 'm late . I wish i could blame it on the traffic . But somehow , i don 't think that 'll fly . [ laughs ] Good morning . You seem like you 're in a great mood . Hey . Crispy like a cracker . I passed by that lot this morning , plot 33 ? And i think i found something . There appears to be a substructure of some kind Underneath the soil . It felt like metal . Oh , well , a water tank , maybe . Y- - but it 's buried in an empty lot , bill , that - - [ groans ] life 's full of mysteries , All chock-full of head scratchers . I wouldn 't think about it too much . Besides , you really shouldn 't snoop around out there . And why is that ? The secret to a safe and happy town Is everyone minding their own business . People need to do what they 're supposed to . And not do what they 're not . Right . Now , uh , i need you to go down to the hospital a bit And pick up some files for me . If - - if you 're not too busy . [ knock on door ] I got your note . I came as soon as i could . Good . Come on in . Here , sit down . Don 't worry . I disabled all the surveillance in here . I thought you didn 't care about that . It 's not for my safety . Coffee ? I heard about the bomb in your truck . You have to believe me . I-i don 't know who did that . Good . But you can figure out who did , can 't you ? Because you 're their leader . What if i was ? Come on , kate ! Of course you are . Look , harold was an accountant . If there 's anybody leading a resistance in this town , It 's not harold , So who else is involved in this group ? This group is the only thing that 's kept me sane here . How long have you been active ? It evolved over time . We started as something else . Just a few of us trying to connect . We 'd meet in secret , Just to be real with each other . Uh ... Kate hewson , um , seattle . I miss the ferry boats , oysters , Hiking burroughs trail . My friends . I 'm , uh - - i 'm - - i 'm franklin . [ clears throat ] uh ... It 's all you , man . Harold ballinger , st . Paul . Um ... I have a fiancée . How come you didn 't tell me any of this When i first got here ? Ethan , i 've been trapped here for 12 years . Try and imagine what that 's like . And then you show up . And a week later , you 're sheriff ? All right , look , it stops now . Why would i stop trying to escape this prison ? [ sighs ] Look , the world that you and i knew , The world outside the fence , that no longer exists . It 's not 2014 . It 's not - - it 's not even the 21st century anymore . [ scoffs ] What - - what do you mean , It 's not the 21st century anymore ? [ sighs ] Hey . Good class today . Oh , thanks , amy . Yeah . You and ben look so nice together . How is that working out ? It 's great , actually . I really like him . Like , a lot . Oh , i 'm so glad . As a teacher , it 's so fulfilling When an assignment turns into something more . Yeah , he 's sweet . Kind of shy . I don 't think he 's had much experience . You might be his first real girlfriend . I was thinking of Maybe asking him out later tonight . Go some place secluded and romantic . Mm . I just - - i feel like I 'm ready for us to be more ... Intimate . He 's not pressuring you ? Ben ? Oh , god , no . I just hope i don 't have to pressure him . [ laughs ] i 'm so happy for you . Enjoy this moment . [ school bell rings ] There 's nothing like being young and in love . Kate : So , let me get this straight . Whoever 's behind all this , The people up there pulling the strings , You work for them now ? [ sighs ] Hand over whoever it was that planted the bomb in my truck , Surrender your arms and explosives By tomorrow morning , And everything stays between us . You can 't take down that fence . Okay . [ door closes ] [ metal clangs ] [ footsteps approach ] [ knock on door ] [ lock clicks ] [ lock clicks ] You were right . They got to ethan . We have to advance the timetable . He knows about us , knows about franklin . Exactly . We have a very narrow window . And we 're not gonna get a second chance . We have to tell everyone . We execute tonight . [ telephone ringing ] Ballinger toys . Oh . H-hello , pam . Of course . Uh , it slipped my mind completely . [ chuckles ] We 've been backlogged with orders and - - I-is it - - is it possible to reschedule ? Of course , i-i understand the importance . Uh , we 'll be right over . All right , then . It 's our annual fertility consult . Of course it is . There 's no point in making her suspicious . So ... We have a married couple - - Young , fertile , in their prime - - And yet , somehow ... Not pregnant . Yeah . I don 't understand it . Your lab work is all good . There 's no problem with the sperm count . Good . And you . Periods regular ? Everything is in working order . Hmm . Well , thanks so much for coming in . You know , I 've always thought so highly of the two of you , Ever since i introduced you . Hmm . I mean , what a blend of genetics . The perfect wayward pines couple . Hmm . Don 't let me down . Woman : Pharmacy , pick up 512 . Pharmacy , pick up 512 . How much time do you need to gather the team ? Whatever you can give me . And get with ted And set the backup plan in motion . Wait . Do you think we need both ? We 're only gonna get one shot . [ elevator bell dings ] [ elevator bell dings ] [ elevator bell dings ] [ doors open ] Kate . Do you have a minute ? I 'm very worried about ethan . Come on . Okay . Kate : Did he tell you the story About it being 2,000 years in the future ? How the world is destroyed , And the we 're the only humans left ? What is going on ? I don 't know , But i think they have some way of brainwashing people Up on that mountain . Now , i - - kate , there 's more . The week after i got here , I finally found a phone that worked . I called a secure line belonging to the service , And agent hassler left me a message . Adam hassler ? Mm-hmm . What did he say ? That i was entering a government experiment . That i should lay low , blend in , And that i may be severely tested , Possibly by another agent . You think that ethan is - - I don 't know , but i can 't rule it out . Theresa , you know hassler . He is nothing if not a straight shooter . How much of this have you told ethan ? I haven 't , and i 'm not sure it 's a good idea to . [ indistinct conversation in distance ] I really have to go . You 're a good person , theresa . And i wish we had met under different circumstances . I 'm so sorry . Ethan , we 're worried about you . You 're worried about me ? Yes . [ sighs ] What , you think this is all in my head ? What do you think ? [ scoffs ] You think , uh , i was brainwashed ? I saw stuff out there , theresa . I 'm not making this up . Everything i told you is true . But you 're telling me that everything is gone . [ sighs ] except us . And i want to keep it that way . So please , tell me . What else did she say ? She told me not to tell you anything , And then she left . She was very emotional when she said goodbye , Like it was a permanent goodbye . Where 's ben ? He 's at school . Okay , i 'm gonna go get him . I think they 're planning something . Hey , so i was thinking . How about later tonight , You and i sneak out for a walk in the woods ? Isn 't that against the rules ? Well , there are rules , and then there are rules . There 's a sweet spot i 've been meaning to show you . It 's like a little meadow up in the trees . How will we get there ? I have a plan . Meet me after dinner ? Corner of birch and 9th ? Yeah , sure . It was fun in class today , huh ? I don 't understand Why people get so nervous talking about biology . Yeah , i - - yeah , i know , right ? It 's just nature . Ethan : Ben ! One second . [ sighs ] What ? Look , i 'm gonna need you to come home . I 'm kind of busy right now . Oh . Hi ! I 'll explain it to you in the car . Say goodbye . Come on , dad . Amy , i-i 'm terribly sorry , but ben 's got to come home . Okay . H-he 'll talk to you later . Go ahead . Say goodbye . Sorry . I got to go . It 's okay . Meet me later . [ sighs ] [ keys jingling ] [ engine turns over ] I just need to know , Did you put that pipe bomb in the sheriff 's truck This morning ? Damn it , ted . The last thing we need is him breathing down our necks . We 're not murderers . Why not ? They murder . You 've been to your share of reckonings . Do you want me to do this or not ? [ indistinct conversations ] [ crickets chirping ] Nurse pam : Second camera just went out at cell 33 . No , it 's kate . She 's trying to throw us off . [ electricity buzzing ] In about 10 minutes , the guards circle around . And once that fence is breached , there 's no turning back . They 'll be on us - - fast . [ beeping ] Where are the blind spots ? There 's one at zone 41 , right at the fence . Almost there . So if anyone 's having second thoughts , Now is the time to go , all right ? Okay , that 's it . Everybody stay right where you are ! Down on the ground ! Ethan ! I 'm not letting you blow up that fence . Get down on the ground . Okay , franklin , Disarm that bomb . Don 't do it . Disarm the bomb , or she 's dead . No . [ gun cocks ] no , franklin . [ breathing heavily ] [ gun cocks ] no . [ beeping , powering down ] I trusted you . Let 's go . Come on , on your feet . Let 's go . [ lock clicks , keys jingle ] [ keys jingling ] [ lock clicks ] We had a deal , kate . They did something to you , ethan . You just don 't know it . You 'll see very soon . We will be back in seattle , overlooking that bay . Seattle ? No , forget it , kate . That 's not gonna happen . You 've got to convince these people to stop this insanity ! It 's not gonna stop . It 's just begun . Where 's your husband ? There 's another bomb . There 's a backup . Where 's harold , kate ? Where 's harold ? ! Amy : It should be here any second . It 's always right on time , right at 8 : 00 . We can catch it right up to the pines . Uh , we could just walk . [ chuckles ] [ vehicle approaches ] It 's more fun this way . Just relax , newbie . I 've done this plenty of other times . [ brakes hiss , engine rumbles ] [ lock clicks ] I need you to locate harold . [ clears throat ] [ keyboard clacks ] Harold ballinger . Last seen at the biergarten less than an hour ago . Who 's that ? That 's ... Ted laufer . He drives the delivery truck . Where is the truck now ? Well , he takes the same route every day . Finishes up on 16th , heads up main to access one , Drops off the truck , and picks up another one . And where does he switch the two trucks ? At the fence . [ sighs ] What 's that ? [ keyboard clacking ] [ engine revving ] [ soft music playing ] What 's that ? [ engine revs , tires squeal ] Here he comes . We got to slow him down . [ tires screeching ] [ groaning ] Man : Get up . Get up ! [ grunting , breathing heavily ] [ engine hissing ] [ soft music playing ] [ brakes squeaking ] [ music stops ] [ groaning ] Are you okay ? Amy . Amy , what are you doing here ? Ben . Ben !

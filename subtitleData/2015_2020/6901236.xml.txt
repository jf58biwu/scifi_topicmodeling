 - Good morning Dr. Fletcher . My name is Dr. olive crown and you need my help . I am a marine biologist and ecologist specializing in oceanic trenches . I am the only non-military personnel to advise on the development of the 80ds-200 exosuit . Working exclusively with the us Navy diving off the coast of Southern California . I had a crucial roll in getting the suit to perform stably at depths of 1,000 feet but their ambition was limited . Yours I believe is not and neither is mine . There were rumors on the confront circuit that you are developing a new suit , one that can go deeper , explore further . I want to be your diver . Your paper suggesting that all life stems from one single deoceanic rift is compelling . Not many people are able to make such a bold statement . And I have one of my own . I have always felt that I am destined to make discoveries that will change the course of humanity . Your expedition , Dr. Fletcher is the first with ambition that matches my own . You need someone who will push themselves to the limit . You need me . Whatever it is your searching for down there . I can find it . Flowing the descent now . Activating suit illumination . - Pressure 's good . Orientation 's good . Continue the descent . - You 're reaching the maximum tolerance of the suit . - I 'm approaching the source of the seismic reading . Keep lowering . - The suit isn 't tested on these depths . - I 'm testing it now . Give me another 200 feet , I 'm almost there . Lowering to 1,500 feet . - Visibility 's dire . Give me some more light . There 's something down here . - Olive ? I can 't hear you . - Dara ? Dara are you there ? - Repeat your last transmission . I can 't hear anything pull her up . Get her out of there . - Olive , olive , olive , olive . Breathe , breathe . Breathe , breathe . Thought we lost you there . - The exosuit failed . How ? - We lost contact with you . But you 're back now . Relax . Breathe . - What happened down there ? - I don 't remember . - Most likely cerebral hypoxia . That would explain the memory loss . You should get it back . But I wanna see you everyday until we dock . And for now , make sure you get some rest . - I shouldn 't of let you go that deep . - I run the dive . This is on me . - But you could 've died . - All part of the job . - You need to listen more . - Dara . You saved my life . Thank you . - Just doing my job . You 're back early . - Dr. Fletcher . - This the tobe I had ? What the fuck happened down there ? There 's millions of pounds of damage . The whole diving 's fucked . - I was almost killed . - What happened down there ? - I don 't remember . - The dive has been postponed indefinitely . You destroyed my suit . My research is wasted , you are fired . - But Dr. Fletcher . - I don 't want to see your face ' till we make port . You 're lucky I don 't throw you overboard . Enjoy your leave . It 's going to last awhile . - What 's the damage ? - Oxygen tank 's burst . - How ? - A blockage . No way to fix it , i need to replace it . - I know Fletcher fired you . It 's not right . - It 's done . - You 'll be home in five days . - I 'd like to remind all crew on Shaw beak to submit for a full physical for the ship Dr. froid spark . I 'm gonna further announce the intra permit to off limits to all personnel after 5pm is complete . - Here let me . - You 're back then . - Just docked . - Have you seen Matthew yet ? You put that down . Stop wasting time with this old country , go see your fella . He 's been moping around since you left . - You 've been looking out for him , haven 't you ? - Of course I have darling . Now get inside and put a smile back on his face . - We 'll catch you later . - Hello ? - Hi . - Olive . Why didn 't you tell me you were back ? - It wasn 't planned . - We have three new patients at work . It 's absolutely crazy . I can 't let em ' down . - Of course . You should go in . - But you 're here . - And I 'll be here when you get home . You 're late already . - It 's only a single . I 'll be back for tea . In fact , I 'm gonna cook you dinner . Crab rozau , you 're gonna love it . - You 're good to me . - I 'll be back before you know it . - Matt . - You down here ? - Just finishing up . - Wow , you 've been busy . - Good day ? - It is now . Five months . - I thought about you , every day . - I 'm no good on my own . - I don 't know . House has never looked better . - I won 't leave again . I 'm back . For good this time . - Going to gym . - I can see . - I did do something all me self . - Maybe I 'll make it up to you . - What you up to today , trouble ? - I 've got something to keep me busy . - I 'm glad you 're home . Don 't go changing . I 'll be back soon . - You 're okay . - You down here ? - Wait , I 'll come up . - You already , yeah ? Table 's booked for six . - I 'm coming . What are you doing back ? - I 'm tired . We should 've finished an hour ago . You 're still in your pj 's ? What have you been up to today ? Lazy day ? You 're wearing shadow . - I 'm fine , I 'll go get changed . - You alright ? - I 'm fine . - Fuckin ' this idiot . Come on mate . Careful . You 'll be sick . - I 'm tired . Okay . Let 's try for a better introduction this time . A smokescreen . Trying to hide are we ? Come on . What are you ? - Where does it come from ? - The dive . - You stole this ? - I found it . - You shouldn 't of took it . - I went through a lot in that day . It was an egg before . It got lodged in the suit . I didn 't know what it was . Still don 't . - It 's a separate part of sorts . It 's old . Really old , almost pre-historic . We found it so deep I 'm surprised it survived up here . Look at that . It does look ill . - What do you mean ? - It 's coloration 's faded , that 's not good . It 's a pretty thing . - Stop ! - You alright ? - I 'm fine . - Have you seen a doctor since we got back ? - I don 't need to . - Can you remember a bit what happened to you down there yet ? - No . But I 'm fine . - Have you told Matt ? - He 'd only worry . - I 'll laugh . - If you wanna help , tell me if that 's a new species . - It won 't be new . The ocean 's more ancient than the mountains . - Is it a new find ? - I don 't know . I can 't be sure here . You need to bring it to the lab . - I don 't work there anymore . - And Dr. Fletcher cannot find out about this . Promise me . - You have been under a lot of stress , olive . You need to get some rest . - Promise me . This is between us . - I promise . - How was work ? - Worse than ever . I could deal with his crap when we were at sea . I have the ocean for company . I 'm off to the locals tonight to see if I can get the wall swaying again . The grogs better than what we had on the boat at least . You and Matt should come down . - Maybe . - Is everything alright with you and him ? - Five months is a long time . - He 's a good guy . I imagine he 's a good listener . - Thanks for coming down , dara . - That thing , whatever it is , you need to find out what it eats . It 's malnourished . And if you really want to categorize this , come by the weekend . You can have my pass . No one will know . - Thanks . You 've got to eat something . Ellena . - If you don 't want me to borrow his bike he shouldn 't of left the keys in it . - You could 've been arrested . - The Cambodia police aren 't as uptight as here . - She 's a wild one your sister . Your turn . Aw , she 's a cheat , that 's the second time you 've had me . - Skilled . See ? Now . - Oh no . No , no . - Oh yes . I think so . - It 's a gift . - A gift , don 't be impolite . - You are a bad influence . - No she 's good for you . If I smell like a press . What 's this ? - You 've trained him well . You gonna marry him then ? - We 're not like that . Ellie . - Still . He 's hot though . Mamma always said you had a good eye . - I miss her . - Me too . Matty ! Hurry up ! My sister needs a drink . - Can you hear that ? - Are you okay ? - I 'm bleeding . - Yeah , let me help . Here , help me . - Hello ? - What have you got in your basement ? - Fletcher . - You took something from my dive . That research belongs to me , you are in serious shit little girl . - Dr. Fletcher , I don 't what you think you 've heard but I don 't have- don 't lie to me , olive . Dara told me everything , you are a thief . - Dara ? - You have a new species . You bring that creature to me right now or I 'll come bang at your door with the police and a team full of lawyers . You 'll never dive again you little thief . You have one hour . - Everything alright ? - I need to go into work . - Today ? But we 're all going out . - Well somebody has to pay the bills . - Calm down . - And what are your plans for today ? More slacking off ? After you 've eaten more of my food . - Olive . - For your information , i was gonna take you out . To say thanks . But you can stuff it . - What 's wrong with you ? Ellie , wait . - What 's the matter ? This is as fresh as I can get . Fletcher . - Is that the spawn ? That creature belongs to me . - Get away from there . You 're hurting it . - It was you who showed me . - It 's mine ! - You don 't even know what you have . - You 're wrong , Fletcher . I have a way to feed it . - She owes me an apology . - Leave out of it , Ellie . Come on . - It was just a joke . Lighten up . She needs to bring it down a peg or two . What does she even do all day ? She thinks she 's so important . - I dunno . - You don 't know a lot about your girlfriend ? Too bad . - And where are you going ? - I 'm gonna find out what 's down there . - You can 't , it 's her work . - Hey ! What are you doing down here ? - Getting your attention . - You can 't be down here . - Hey , you 're hurting me . - You can 't be down here . - What 's wrong with you ? I came to help you . You 've lost a lot , even Matt thinks you 're crazy . - Matt said that ? - As good as . What 's happened to you ? And what are you doing down here ? - It 's called work , sis . Maybe you should try it sometime . - You 're not as special as what you think you are , olive . - It 's okay . No one 's going to hurt you again . - I like your sister but , it 's nice just the two of us . Don 't feel like I 've seen you in ages . - My work 's important . - I know . I know . Ellie didn 't break anything did she ? She 's a wild one your sister . Uncontrollable . You know my work 's pretty busy at the moment . Yeah this there 's little old lady . Ms. Jones . She 's almost 90 but , she doesn 't have long left . We 're monitoring around the clock . She 's mute . Can 't communicate her off . Can 't make a sound . It 's sad . - Very sad . - Local experts inform the council yet again about the severe weather set to hit the coast in the next few days . Residents and flood risk areas are advised to take necessary precautions in the events of flooding . - What are you doing ? I didn 't expect this . You here for lunch ? - You left your ID . - You came all this way for that ? - Thought you 'd need it . - No I , I do , thanks . Do you wanna come for lunch ? - I can 't . - You know what Dr. Fletcher was like , Oliver , he just keeps on pushing and pushing . He just constantly and he wouldn 't let up but , I didn 't mean to let anything out . I 'm sorry . I screwed up . I haven 't seen Fletcher since I told him . Did you know there was a fire on the boat ? I 'll do anything I can to help . It 's pretty dark in here , olive . - Over here . Children grow up so fast . - Oh my god . - Fletcher was wrong to try and take it from me . You should never separate a mother from her child . - You okay ? - This fucking wine . - What 's wrong ? - A patient went missing today . I 'm really worried about her . - Shit . - Management is starting to point fingers . They say it 's my fault . I could lose my job . - I 'm sure everything will be fine . Here . Have a beer instead . - I 'm leaving tomorrow . - What ? Why ? - I 'm a traveler . Gotta keep rolling . - I 'll be working tomorrow . - Then I guess this is goodbye . - We should have a drink . - I don 't feel like it . - Oh come on , don 't be like that . Forget about the red . We got white . I could open the white . Let 's have a drink , it 'll be a laugh . - Okay . - They fired me . - What is it ? Let me see . I can 't believe it . I can 't believe it . I have to tell them . Matt . Ellie , Matt . - Olive . - You bitch . Let me go . You 're crazy , let me go ! - Ow ! You 're my sister . My own flesh and blood . - What are you doing ? Let me go . Matt needs help ! - He needs nothing . - Olive ! Let me out you crazy bitch . Olive ! Come on ! - Olive . - Olive . Olive ! Where is she ? - No . - You attacked me . How could you do that ? To me . - You love her . - Ellena ? - Matt ! Matt . Matt . No ! - Come on . - Stop taking up , where are you ? - Olive ! - Be quiet . She needs rest . - What the fuck is that ? - She 's a god . A god I command . She won 't hurt you unless I want her to . At first I was overwhelmed . It 's a merciful thing . The inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents . But now I understand . They have slumbered for ions down there . In the dark below . Waiting to be awoken . They chose me . - You 've gone fucking mental . - How dare you . I was going to share this with you . - You 're a murderer . - I did what was deemed to be done . - You killed Matt . - A necessary sacrifice . He would not of survived what is to come . Let me show you . - Olive , don 't . It 'll kill you . What are you doing in there ? What is that ? - Our future . Your future . We live on a placid island of ignorance . In the mists of black seas of infinity . And it was not meant that we should voyage far . But I have seen beyond the bounds of infinity . And drawn down demons from the start . I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world . To sew death and madness . - Olive . You need to put that back . - She won 't ever hurt me . - Is everyone okay ? I can hear an awful noise . - Get me out of here . - Hang on , darling . I can 't see a bloody thing . - Ms. crown I 'm sorry but we 've checked the basement , we 've checked the perimeter and there 's no trace of this animal you described missing . Put in a call for the station we 're gonna need a trauma counselor or something now . We 've got a broken drainage break downstairs . Think the suspect could 've escaped down there . We notified dispatch , get some searches out , maybe have a look in the sewer system and see what 's going on . - As water levels continue to rise and more families are forced to evacuate flood risk areas , government officials are coming under fire for slow response times in the current crisis . Over 600 homes in the north of england have suffered severe flooding . And what experts are calling the biggest rain fall of the last 10 years . Flood defenses across the region failed to provide adequate protection against the rising waters with key roads cutting off emergency services . One local government deny reports that a lack of appropriate flood defenses has diverted the majority of flood water into the sewage system contaminating hundreds of miles of the nearby coastal region . Environmental groups are citing the contamination as the reason behind the dwindling marine life in the region . With the local fishing industry in an understandable uproar . This past week , thousands of dead fish and other marine life have washed up on nearby beaches . Including some species never before seen in the blue waters . Several beaches along the coastline have already been declared at fault . - Mommy , what 's that ? There 's more over there .

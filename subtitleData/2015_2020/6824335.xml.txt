 Previously on " Incorporated " ... Take this . - Bye , Aaron . - I 'll find you . My sister , she 's a sex slave . - Where is she ? - Arcadia . Can you get in here ? Access is restricted to senior execs . - What was that ? - Tell me you got a plan . Position 's about to open up on the 40th . Chad got fired today . Then we revoke his security clearance , execute his nondisclosure agreement . No one gets to senior management without the company learning everything . We got the permit . - We 're gonna get pregnant . - Micronesian nationalists killed a dozen of our guys today . Word is , it was Inazagi agents . Inazagi ? You think they 'd dare to ? I mean , we both want that promotion , right ? I may have underestimated you , Ben Larson . Sometimes I even surprise myself . No . What 's wrong , Jaimie ? I think my mom might 've said a bad thing , Officer Bucky . Like a bad word ? No . Much worse than a bad word . But I don 't know if I should tell anybody . Was it about the company , Jaimie ? I don 't want to get my mom in trouble . Of course you don 't . You love your mom , don 't you ? But you also love your dad and your sister and your friends . And you love me , too , don 't you , Jaimie ? Well , sure . You see , Jaimie , the company is made up of all kinds of parts . Just like your machine here . All the parts need to work together . And if one is broken or defective or weak ... We wouldn 't want anything like that to happen to the company , would we ? I think I 'm ready to tell you what my mom said . Good job , Jaimie . You did the right thing ... for your family and for the company . Now you 're a real company deputy . Just like me ! Thanks , Officer Bucky ! If you hear something yucky , tell Officer Bucky . If you hear something yucky , tell Officer Bucky . If you hear something yucky , tell Officer Bucky . If you hear something yucky , tell Officer Bucky . If you hear something yucky , tell Officer Bucky . What about Thursday afternoon ? We have Everclear test trials all day . Um , I could also do Friday lunch time . I 'll be working on the presentation of the results . I 'll probably have to eat at my desk . You know , they 're just gonna remove the IUD . You don 't need to be there for that . I told you , I want to be there every step of the way . It 's just this promotion . You know , they need to see I really want it . You don 't have to want it . You know that , right ? Think we 're doing pretty well for ourselves . Who is this adorable little munchkin ? Hi , my name is Hazel . I 'm a Spiga Scout Leader , and I have a question for you today . Do you like chocolate ? Well , yes , I do . I have great news for you then , ma 'am . This week , we have a two-for-one special on our best-selling cookies . The Triple Chocolate Fudge Bomb . Name trademarked . That is quite a sales pitch , young lady . Please come in and show me your selection . We take e-payment in any major currencies ... - dollars , yuans , blackcoin . - Great . Come on in here . So this is life on the 35th floor ? You got a pool back there ? That 's 40th and up and you know it . Yeah , sure , even water 's a perk these days . Show me the cookies . What are you doing here ? You asked me to keep track of the five new girls in Arcadia . Well , last night , I got an I-92 . - Let 's make it fun . - Okay ... - That 's a ... - Termination of contract form . One of them tried to escape , stole a weapon , she got shot by a guard . Was it Elena ? We don 't get names in H.R. , just their codes . You 'll have to use your keyhole to find out for yourself . I can 't , I lost it . - You lost it ? - Someone took it . Shit . Can they trace it back to you ? No , it has a self-destruct protocol . If someone tried to access it , it 'll burn itself out . Protocols can be overwritten . Do yourself a favor , will you ? Forget about Elena . Have some kids , sell some cookies . Now tell me , what are these badges ? Well ... this one is my dream-catcher badge . My gosh . I can 't . If she 's alive , I need to find out . There 's no way . Not unless you could get a look at the body , and we both know that 's impossible . Honey , time to go . Watch it ! What can I get ya ? Water . $ 5.92 . Anything else ? Some ice , maybe ? - Try the Four Seasons . - Okay , what about your contact ? Nice segue . Real smooth . Does it ever work ? Well , different girls , different approaches . You strike me as the type who doesn 't have time for bullshit . - You 're direct . - Really ? What else do you see in your crystal ball ? You work hard . You 're tough as nails . And your father would cut my balls off if he saw me talking to his little girl . I 'm sure he wouldn 't be the first to try . - See , you know me , too . - I don 't . And you don 't know me , either . But I do . Aaron ? Told you I 'd find you . I can 't believe it ! I told you to sell this . I had to . A couple times , actually , but ... I always made sure to get it back . - Last night ? - Yeah . Dumb skint made a run for it . I mean , you 'd think they 'd be grateful . They get to eat better than we do . I don 't know , I 've heard she was servicing Holmes . The way the guy runs the Hydroponics Department , I 'm sure he likes to make them bleed . Run diagnostics . What the ... abort diagnostics . Disengage device . Shut power down now ! The Inazagi delegation 's on its way , sir . ETA , 1100 hours . Good . It 's time to bring these negotiations to a close , Elizabeth . I 'm confident we can reach an agreement . Close the deal . But don 't settle , get the agricultural rights north of the Loire . Inazagi can keep the rest , all the way down to Gibraltar , for all we care . That won 't be a problem . One last thing . Fellow members of the board have been questioning your ability to handle these talks . Especially under your own roof . If this is because of the Peterson security breach , I guarantee his file has been permanently closed . Is that so , Julian ? Absolutely , sir . Mr. Peterson was acting alone . The file 's closed . For your own sake , Elizabeth , keep your house in order . And remember : The markets are watching closely . Elizabeth . It 's been a long time , EVP Mason . It 's a pleasure to meet you , SVP Walters . I hope we can wrap this up today . The pleasure 's mine , Ms. Krauss . But I 'm afraid we have miles to go before we sleep . Diana Walters , 43 years old . Senior Vice President of Global Resources . Recruited by Inazagi in '54 , right out of college . Married , no children . I have miles to go before I sleep . We have a defector on our hands . We can 't be sure . What , you think she 's a Robert Frost fan ? Come on , Julian . We 've both heard that quote before . An executive at her level ? I want to hear what she has to offer . Even if you 're right , even if she 's asking for a job interview , a defection takes time , planning , groundwork . We mess it up , the diplomatic shitstorm will be unprecedented . That 's why I had the counterintelligence tech division sent in . You want Peterson 's position ? Show me what you got . If you need a private space to talk , we can set up a velvet curtain in no time . And then what ? How are we supposed to extract her in front of the entire Inazagi delegation ? I heard there 's a dead girl in Arcadia . If it 's true , we could use her body to make a switch . Even if it were true , how would you know about it ? Rumors spread quickly . There aren 't supposed to be any . Well , that 's your department 's job , right , Julian ? So , Ben ... what 's the plan ? Well , Inazagi needs to take a body home . It doesn 't need to be alive , though . And they just need to believe it 's Diana Walters . No , no , no ! Let go ! Stop . Stop ! Pull over ! Please ! No , please ! Hey ! Hey ! What 's going on here ? This woman works for you , ma 'am ? She does . Why ? - I 'm very sorry , Miss ... - Larson . But I 'm afraid we 've caught her leaving with stolen goods . Stolen goods ? You recognize this ? It 's real bacon . I 'd say $ 600 worth . Yes , that 's mine . It 's was a ... present for her . A present ? Yes . For her years of service . She 's been quite good to us . It 's a very expensive present , ma 'am . You have to provide your maid with a signed authorization for things like this . I-I really don 't have the time for this . You know what ? Why don 't you keep it ? So you know we appreciate your service , too . Much appreciated , ma 'am . Have a good day . You too . If you swipe to page 23 of the attached memo , you 'll see that our offer is more than generous . After all , the arable land south of the Pyrenees is showing high levels of soil erosion , making it a less desirable site for class one high-yield corporate acquisition and cultivation . As we 'll demonstrate , independent studies from the Human Toxicity Bureau indicate the remaining soil ... - Clear . - Yeah . " I have miles to go before I sleep . " Glad you recognized my message . Let 's skip the pleasantries . We have about two minutes before they check in on you . Direct . Works for me . I want the basic extraction package ... new name , face , fingerprints , and relocation to one of your foreign offices . I 'm partial to sandy beaches and nice weather . Anchorage , perhaps . Let 's say that can be arranged . Why should I give it to you ? My company 's developing a new line of seeds . A design that 'll wipe Spiga off the map . I 'm afraid you 're gonna have to give me more than that . Why do you think we 're so ready to settle for a worthless piece of land like Spain or the south of France ? Because very soon , we 'll be able to grow crops in the desert . If your people really can do that , why join the losing side ? You 're pregnant . And I don 't want my child to grow into a mindless Inazagi drone . So the rumors of the indoctrination programs - are true . - You have no idea . Ma 'am , it 's time . All right , you got yourself a deal . Not so easy . The Kusari is a next-generation tech virus . Not only does it monitor my position and my hormone levels , it 'll terminate me if I try to escape . Shit , there 's a kill switch in her blood . Only EVP Mason can disarm it . Ma 'am ? I 'm coming in . Jesus , you startled me . All right , you heard the lady . Do we have any quick thinkers in the room ? Now is your moment to shine . The kill switch and its trigger , they 're connected wirelessly . If we find the frequency , we can hack the Kusari and disarm it . Too dangerous . We don 't know what kind of firewall it has . It could kill her as soon as we try to break in . Share your wisdom with us , then . How do you propose we disarm it ? We don 't . We get Inazagi to do it for us . That 's quite clever . And risky , to say the least . It could trigger an all-out war with Inazagi . And you 'd most certainly lose your job . If they 're really on the verge of such a breakthrough , there won 't be a job for me to lose . Or you . Get everything ready . You 're dismissed . With all due respect , I think I should be present for the extraction . It 's no secret my husband was killed during an Inazagi rescue operation . And he 's a hero to everyone in this company . If anything went wrong , I couldn 't put Laura through something like that again . Yeah , I understand . But someone needs to reprogram the Kusari in a matter of seconds and fool it into accepting the girl 's body as Diana Walters . I may not be a field agent , but I 'm the best coder you have . You really want this promotion , don 't you ? More than anything . It 's here . It 's me , Victor . I 've got a client for ya . Put all of your devices inside the locker , please . So tell me ... what can a lowly Red Zone cracker do for the cream of the crop of the almighty Spiga ? I need help bypassing a self-destruct protocol . You poor suits . Always trying to catch up . How many kids get it , really ? I 'm not just any kid , you 're looking at an honor student , here . Hey , I 'm impressed , don 't get me wrong . It 's just the scholarship seems like a con to me . And they pick , what , one Red Zone brainiac out of every 10,000 ? Who you calling " brainiac , " you petty thief ? You think I 'm still hacking rations ? I 'm pulling blackcoins off watches now ... cyberhauls . That shit 's gonna get you killed , you know ? That shit kept me alive and fed till now . Here it is . - See you after class ? - Of course . We have five years of catching up to catch up on . Don 't worry about it , it 's nothing . Today 's lesson is brought to you by Kamikaze Burger . Home of the Double Whammy ... now with 10 % real beef . Chemistry lesson will start in three , two , one . Elena ! Hey , wake up ! Come on ! Hey ! Okay . Elena ? Okay . All right . It 's okay . Elena . Yeah . Aaron ? Hey there , brainiac . Let 's go . Where are we going ? Out of here . We 've kept her " on ice , " if you will , for the last few days . Sometimes we get guests with very specialized tastes that we can 't always cater to , which is a shame . So when she got shot , I thought , " Well , lemonade , right ? " Over at Arcadia , we always strive ... You are aware that this is someone 's daughter you 're talking about ? You okay ? Yeah , just ... surprised ... I thought the procedure was going to be done here . Well , had to move it up . I sent the surgical team to Arcadia to change the companion 's face . Couldn 't risk them being spotted on site . Smart . Let 's get set up . Who was she ? Her ? Someone desperate . People out there ... life pushes them hard enough , they 'll sign anything . Someone like you wouldn 't understand . A keyhole . This allows you to snoop into any system without leaving footprints . Not exactly corporate tech . What kind of trouble you in ? No trouble at all . You sure ? A climber like you gets caught with something like this , he 's gonna get spanked . Or worse . I hear that Spiga security can be very inventive with a cattle prod . Let 's talk business . If I wanted to listen to an old hag talk dirty , I 'd give my mom a call . Your mother 's dead . Like hell she is . Lung cancer in ' 69 . Right before you joined Spiga . That 's too bad . She would 've been so proud of you . It 's what I do , son . Enough with the chitchat . How do I crack it ? I could encode a skeleton key for you . That would bypass the self-destruct protocol . Good . Just say when so I can get the hell out of this shithole . When was the last time you were out here ? Out here ? Outside the wall . Rubbing elbows with the skints . Last Friday , why ? Let me guess . Scored a little blur , some eye candy , maybe took in the conjoined-twins freak show down on Fifth . What do you want ? The same thing you do . Entertainment . - You see her ? - See what ? Beady eyes , pair of whiskers , long tail . The rat ? I want you to catch it . You 're kidding . Dead or alive , your call . You 're a fucking cu ... You kiss your dead mom with that mouth ? Forget it . - I 'll find someone else . - You won 't . No one 's gonna give you a skeleton key if I tell ' em not to . I 'll give you one , though . All you got to do is catch a little animal with a brain the size of a peanut . How hard can that be ? Motherfuck ! Now that 's entertainment . Upset , betrayed ... I mean , I-I-I don 't know how else to put it . We 've been good to you . That you would do this to us is ... I didn 't do it for me . The people in my building , we ... we have a fund . We all contribute . $ 50 a month , every family . If there 's an emergency , you can access the money . My neighbor , Rosa , she missed a payment . You have to understand ... you don 't miss a payment . You miss a payment and you 're out . Your neighbor , what did she need the money for ? A doctor . Her daughter , there ... there 's something wrong with her belly . I 've been hearing her scream through the night , so ... Excuse me if I hurt your feelings . Is the pain on her right side ? I 'm not sure . Well , it could be appendicitis . Yeah , well , I 'll make sure they include that in her obituary . Now , if you don 't mind , I assume I 'm out of a job . Bring her in . Excuse me ? Your friend 's daughter . Bring her tonight , I 'll examine her . The kid 's not authorized to enter . I 'll sign her in . You bring her to the gate and I 'll sign her in . Don 't worry . I 'll wait till the very last second before I activate the venom . And then how much time do we have ? The moment it hits her , five minutes to bring her back . Longer than that , and we 'll lose the baby . Tell me this isn 't the craziest thing we 've ever done . Now you want me to lie to you ? A fruitful negotiation calls for a celebration . A celebration ... of kinship and unity . We are , after all , but simple cells in the body corporate . Our bodies are temples . Unsullied . Pure . This man 's body is a dump . But we thank him for his sacrifice . To the infinite glory of the corporate mother . What 's wrong with her ? I don 't know . She was linked . She was in the group ... must be some sort of reaction - to the neural connect ... - Where is the doctor ? Can I get the doctor in here immediately , please ? - He 's on his way ! - Jesus , she has no pulse . She 's gonna be fine , Richard . We 're gonna bring her back . Step aside , please . She 's gone into cardiac arrest . Stand back . 400 joules . - Wait ! Stop . - What is it ? There 's something in her blood , a tech virus . The electrical shock will set it off . - If you zap her , she dies . - I don 't zap her , she dies . Shit . - Can you disarm it ? - I ... Sir , if you can , you have to disarm it right now . - I 'm not ... - Right now ! - Authorized . - We 're losing her . Go , go . 400 joules . 500 joules . Okay , we need to get her in an ambulance . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Get out ! I 'm not authorized to leave her alone . I 'm trying to save her life , do you really want to take my place ? We 'll meet you downstairs . - How long have we got ? - 17 seconds . Bring her back . Not until you crack the Kusari . We have to give them a body . Come on , we 're gonna lose her . Working on it . We 're almost there . It 's uploading . She 's gone . I 'm sorry . Take SVP Walters 's body away . You must really want this thing . You sure you 're not in trouble ? Look , I 've done what you asked . Which makes me wonder . Your dad is George Caplan , CEO of one of Spiga 's biggest suppliers . What 's George Caplan 's son doing chasing a skeleton key in the Red Zone ? - What kind of a fuck-up are you ? - I 'm not a f ... Didn 't you get a girl killed once , messing around with your dad 's car autodrive ? Yeah , well , you seem to know a lot about me . Why don 't you tell me a little something about yourself ? Well , there 's not that much to tell . I got here with the first wave of climate refugees . Chased up north by the sand storms . Government rations were never enough . You were probably sucking on your gestator 's tit while my brother and I had to scramble for enough protein . Sometimes there was only one source of it . Although it was everywhere , really . I 'd tell you it tastes like chicken , but I don 't really remember what chicken tastes like . Why don 't you tell me if it tastes like chicken ? - You want me to ... - Eat it . I want George Caplan 's fuck-up of a son to eat it . You 're sick . I 'm also the only person that can get you that skeleton key . Now , how bad do you want it ? I 'm here to sign in two workers . She 's here . There 's a problem , ma 'am . There were two names on the log . Right . Two servers to help with the dinner party . Well , take a look . Hands off the gate . Rachel ? - Rachel ! - Ms. Larson . Who are all these people ? I don 't know what happened . They heard and word spread we were coming . Are they sick ? Yeah . Ma 'am , this is a breach hazard . I know . These people aren 't authorized to be in the perimeter . They are , they 're on the log . Let them in . These two . These two only ! Back off ! Can you Le ... - I said back off ! - Open the gate ! Okay , fuck this ! Engage ! Let me in ! Can you grab my hand ? Aah ! Here , come on . ! Mr. Morse requested the companion 's personal effects . Yeah . What are we doing here ? This is what I like to call my screaming place . - Your screaming place ? - Yeah . Every time I get evicted ... or shaken down by a cop or a blurhead takes a swing at me , I come here . And I scream my guts out . I wouldn 't know what to scream about . You 're shitting me , right ? You spend 17 hours a day in that juku letting them pump you with nootropics and cognitive enhancers and ... Don 't forget the amphetamines . Sometimes I 'm so wired , I just ... spend the whole night staring at the ceiling . Still hearing the lessons in my head . Jesus , Lena . You 're the one who 's gonna get killed . How many of these seizures have you had already ? You don 't understand . When things are tough at home and money 's short , I eat first . Then Theo , then my dad . And I get the best mattress , even if I can 't really enjoy it . Anything so the straight-A student can keep getting straight " A " s . So ... how can I complain ? They just have so much riding on this scholarship . On me . What about you ? You got to come up and breathe every once in a while , you got to live . And by " live , " you mean screaming at the top of your lungs ? Hey , don 't knock it till you try it . And it definitely helps you forget an empty stomach . I promise . Come on . Give it a shot . So how did that feel ? Not bad ? Yeah . Yeah , you got some lungs on you , girl , wow . I think I can do better . Please , do your worst . Shut the fuck up ! Ben ? You did excellent work today . I 'll make sure the board takes notice . Ms. Walters is stable . The Kusari 's being flushed out of her system as we speak . She should be ready for debriefing in the next 24 hours . - And her child ? - Unharmed . I 'll deliver this to the family . You know you don 't have to . I got to hand it to you , you goddamn suits are ambitious . Hungry , even . There . You earned it . I encoded your key in a piece of organic material , undetectable to your scanners . That 's a freebie . You ... you recorded it ? For my own personal collection . If I ever see you around here again , I 'm gonna share that video with every single one of your contacts . Go home , suit . Don 't forget to take your antibiotics . Those little bastards carry all sorts of bugs . Laura ? Everything okay ? Yeah . Just tired . Boring day at work . Yeah . Mine , too . I 've been thinking , and ... I 'm gonna clear my schedule . - Ben . - Forget about the promotion . After all , we 're ... doing pretty well for ourselves , right ? Right . How 's Wednesday for the appointment ? It 's perfect . I 'm here to thank you for your daughter 's service to the company . Which was greater than you could imagine . These are her personal effects . But where is my baby ? Unfortunately , we cannot return her body to you . Like I said , I-I 'm sorry . I can 't imagine anything worse than losing a child . Theo . Jesus . Where 's Anthony ? I waited till he left . He didn 't see me . What are you doing here ? I 'm sorry , Theo . Where 'd you get this ? She tried to escape . - She ... - I couldn 't . I failed . I didn 't get to her in time . Familial DNA detected . Play recording . Hey , Theo . It 's me , your big sis . If you 're watching this , that means Melissa 's managed to escape and given you Mom 's ring . She 's a good friend . Try to help her as much as you can . She 's still alive . She 's had a tough life , but she 's a survivor . Like we are . Um , the reason I 'm recording this is there have been rumors going around . Girls getting NDA-ed at the end of their contracts . We 've seen too much , I guess , and they ... they want to wipe our minds clean . I 'm sure it was buried somewhere in the fine print . But , um , if you see me years from now , and ... and I don 't recognize you ... please don 't hate me . I want you to know that I love you . And I 'll always be your big sis .

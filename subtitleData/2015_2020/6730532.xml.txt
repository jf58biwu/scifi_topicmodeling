 My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk . United Federation of Planets I came here before you as a neutral representative of the Fabonane Republic . And bring you a message of good will And present to you , esteemed members of the teenaxiene delegation A gift from Fabonan High Council with the highest regard . What 's wrong with it ? - Excuse me ? - Why the don 't they want it anymore ? Well ... This was once a piece of an ancient weapon And now they offer it as a symbol , of of peace . In the Fabonan culture this surrendal weapon is an offer of truth . How they got it ? They told me , they acquired it long time ago . So they stole it , then ! No , uhm ... It 's not like they were familiar with the Fabonan . I know us . You have a point . Your excellency , this gift ... There are a nations of thieves who want to kill us . This beloved artifact is a symbol of trust and peace . You will cut us into pieces , and roast us over a fire ... I do not think that 's true and eat us ! What ? Scotty , get me out of here ! Well , that was quick . There are many interference on the surface , sir . I ripped my shirt again . How 'd it go ? Captain , did you manage to broke a treaty with diplomacy ? Let 's just say we came out short . You look ... move this back into the vault , Spock . Thank you . - Jim , you look like crap . - Thank you , Bones . You have a little vein popin out of your tremble again . You okay ? It 's better . It 's just a another day in fleet . Captain 's Log , Stardate 2263.2 Today is our 966-day in deep space . A little over 3 years of our 5 year mission . More time you spend out here , the harder it is to tell when one day ends and the next one begins . It can be a challenge to feel grounded when even gravity is artifical . But while we do what we can to make it feel like home The crew is always continues to act admirably despite the rigors of our extended stay here in outer space and the personal sacrifices they have made . We continue to search for new forms in order to establish firm diplomatic ties . Understanding the time in uncharted territories stretched the ships mechanical capacities but fortunately , our engineering departement led by Mr.Scott ... is more than up for the job . The ship aside , prolonged cohabitation has ... definitely infects on interpersonal dynamics . Some experience is for better and some for worse . As for me things have started to feel little episodic . Futher out we go , the more I find myself wondering what is it we are trying to accomplish . If the universe is trully endless , then if we 're not striving for something forever out of reach . The Enterprise is scheduled for repremission to stop at Yorktown , Federation 's newest and most advanced starbase . Perhaps a break from routine will offer us some rest , but not from mysteries , the unknown . Sorry , I 'm late . Keenser 's weakend by some hallious seed green flu and Scotty is terrified , he 's gonna sneeze on warp core and kill us all . What the hell are you drink ? Pretty sure it 's the rest of that Saurian brandy we picked up on Thasus . My god man ! Are you trying to go blind ? That stuff 's illegal . Besides , I found this in Chekov 's locker . Wow ! Right , I mean I always assumed he would be Vodka guy ... Vodka guy . Exactly . I wanted to have something appropriate for your birthday . It 's a couple of days , you know I don 't care about that . I know . You don 't like celebrating it to on the day because it 's also the day your pop bit the dust . I was being sensitive . Did they teach you about better manner at medical school ? Or it 's just a sudden charm ? - It 's good . - Hordy . You 're gonna call your mom ? Yeah , of course I 'll call on the day . I 'm an year older . Yeah , that 's usually how it works . A year older than he ever got to be . He joined the Starfleet because he he believed in it . I joined on a dare . You joined this if you can live up to him . It 's been all this time , you are trying to be George Kirk and now you 're wondering just what it means to be Jim why you 're out here . To prove that aside and a full head of hair . - Kirk here . - Captain . - Approaching Yorktown base . - I 'm on my way , Mr. Sulu . Let 's keep this birthday thing in a wraps something . You know me . Mr. Sensitive . Aaah , that is impressive . Aye . She is a beauty , isn 't she ? What a damn monstrosity . Can 't we just wrap some space on a planet ? Sharing geographical favouritism among conducted Federation worlds could cause diplomatic tension . Oh , you don 't think that looks tense ? Looks like a damn snow globe in space just waiting to break . Ah , that 's the spirit , Bones ! Spock ! Do you have a moment ? Of course , Nyota . You should have this back . It belonged to your mother . It is not in a Vulcan custom to receive again that thing which was given as a gift . You guys break up ? What did you do ? A typically reductive incourin out to . You know Spock , if an Earth girl says it 's me not you . It 's definitely you . Excuse me . Commander Spock . Will you have a minute of your time ? Thank you for bringing me this , into my attention . Live long and prosper . Live long and prosper . Ambassador Spock 2230.06 - 2263.02 I have an alert of incoming vessel . Unidentified non-federation . Attention , unidentified vessel . We have not authorized your approach . Power down and wait for instruction . Unidentified vessel , please reply . Just speak normally . Language analysis complete UNIVERSAL TRANSLATOR We were on a science mission inside the nebula . Our ship suffered a critical malfunction . I took an escape pod . Before the ship crash landed on a nearby planet . We need a ship , capable of navigating the nebula . You must have someone , who can help us . We tracked her stranded ship through the sector of uncharted nebula . Here . 210 , mark 14 . Long-range scan ? No data . The nebula is too dense . It 's uncharted space . Well , the Enterprise does have the best navigational systems in the fleet . She can handle it . The only ship here , with more advanced technology is still under construction . But it 's not just a ship that I am sending . I 'll gather the crew . Captain . Starfleet Command sent me your application for your vice-admiral position here at this installation . Yes , ma 'am . If I may , I would recommend Commander Spock ... to replace me as a Captain of the Enteprise . He is an exemplary Starfleet officer . He 'll make a great Captain . It isn 't uncommon , you know . Even for a captain , to want to leave . There 's no relative direction in the vastness of space there 's only yourself . Your ship , your crew . It 's easier than you think to get lost . I 'll really talk with the General Council . We 'll discuss it , when you return . - Mr. Spock . - Captain . - I have something ... - Perhaps there ... - No , please . - Captain , after you . I insist . After this mission , we should we should sit down . There is something I need to talk about . I , as well , have something to share . We make a good team , right ? I believe we do . I insist . Lt. Uhura , open a ship wide channel . Yes , Captain . Attention , crew of the Enterprise . Our mission is straightforward . The rescue of a crew stranded on a planet in uncharted space . Our trajectory will take us through an unstable nebula one which will disable all communication with Starfleet . We will be on our own . The Enteprise has something no other ship in the fleet has . You . As we can 't understand there 's no such space , the unknown . We 'll be temporarily hidden . Kirk out . Readings indicate cloud density deminishing , sir . This is Altamid . Our ship is stranded here . Approaching Altamid . Class M planet . Massive subterranean fauna , with unlimited unknown life forms on the surface ... Proximity alert , sir . We have an unknown ship heading right on us . - Lt. Uhura , hail them . - Yes , Captain . No response . I have readings on some kind of a signal . They are jamming us . Magnify , Mr. Sulu . What is this ? Shields up ! Red alert ! Fire at will ! Sir , our phasers are having minimal effect and our torpedoes can 't track the movement . Fire everything we 've got . Captain , we are not equipped for this matteral engadgement . Shields frequency has no effect , sir . They got the DITCH . Shields are offline . - Get us out of here , Mr. Sulu . - Yes , sir . - Why the hell aren 't we moving ? - I can not engage the warp drive , sir . Scotty , I need warp now . I can not , sir . ... they are gone . Security , engage all emergency procedures . All personnel to emergency stations . I have hull breaches in levels 12 to 15 , 6 , 9 , 31 and 21 , sir . Captain , in a 10 sec I could reroute the energy from the warp core to the impulse engines . Evacuating have no need , we have to do it . Do whatever you have to , Scotty . Keenser let 's go . The door is opened , Krall . Connecting plasma pipes , stand by then you start it on my mark ! Missing piece of Abornath . Weapon will be complete . - Captain . - Aye , Spock . We have an unidentified intruders , with an attack party . They infiltrated the archive vault , and removed the artifact from our mission on Teenax . * something * Spock ! Spock ! You two , with me . Sulu , you are commanding officer . Yes , sir . My god ! ... the hell ? Doctor ? Doctor , we must evacuate now ! Captain Kirk Yes ! We have 100 % impulse . Great work , Mr. Scott ! Maximum impulse towards the nebula ! Aye ! Krall , the ship runs into nebula . Cut it 's neck . Kirk to bridge . We are losing the innertial dampers . Systems are failing throughout the ship , Captain . The emergency blockades are sealing but the structural integrity is at 18 % and falling , sir . Abandon ship , Mr. Sulu . Sound the alarm . Maybe in those Pods it 's a chance to escape Can you lead the ship to way ? The impulse engines are still trying to draw power from the warp reserve . We can not move until the SAUCER is separated . I 'll handle it . Aye aye , sir . We got to get you guys to escape pod . Go . Ensign . Syl . I need your help . Yes , sir . My god ! Spock , they are taking the crew . Are you okay ? SAUCER should be free by now . I know , Mr. Sulu . The Captain should be there . SAUCER SEPARATION The impulse engines drawing power from auxiliary generators . Captain . How many of the crew is still pod disposal ? None . If I read this correctly the intruders are taking them . Captain , we 're caught in the planet 's gravity . We can not pull away . Get your damn pods . - Yes , sir . - Aye , Captain . Come on ! Let 's go ! You knew ... You knew we would be attacked . You don 't understand . Captain Kirk . Yes , I lied . Our ship was attacked . Chekov , check your comms for survivors . Aye aye , aye Captain . - Who is he ? - His name is Krall . He took my crew , like he took yours . How did he know so much about the Enterprise ? All I know is that if I did this he 'll set them free . Chekov , are you picking anything upon those scanners ? Nothing . - What if he ... - No , no . He was taking them . We have to find that SAUCER even minimal scanning systems will have longer range than tricorders . Aye , Captain . It 's possible . Captain , I was protecting my crew . What is your name ? How do you know our language ? I know your kind . I 'm Lt. Nyota Uhura of the USS Enteprise . And you have committed an act of war against Fede ... Federation . That always is an act of war . You 've attacked us . Your captain ... Why have you sacrificed yourself for him ? He would have done the same . And if he made it off that ship , he will come for us . I 'm counting on it , Lt. Uhura . I can 't believe it . My god , Spock ! Sit down over here . Okay , easy , easy . I 'll just a ... Try to relax . Your 're going to be okay . The forced optimism in your voice suggests you are trying to enlist essensive calm in order ... Cut the horse shit . Doctor . I failed to see how excrement of any kind feels relevance in our current situation . - What the hell are you doing ? - We must keep moving , doctor . Spock , this thing punched your iliac region . - Time is a critical factor . - That 's exactly what I am trying to tell you . Look , I can 't take this out . You are gonna die . Okay , if I take it out and can 't stop the bleeding , you are gonna die . I can 't see no appealing in neither option . Yea well believe it or not , but neither can I. So , if I remember correctly Tha uh Vulcans , have their hearts , where humans have their livers . That is correct , doctor . That explains some things . You know , you are lucky . Two centimeters to the left and you would be dead already . I just don 't get it , Spock . What , what did they attack us for ? I mean ... They do all this for some dude and a tiny crystal we didn 't want ? It is unwise to trivialize that which one simply does not understand , Doctor . We can simply assume that it 's more important than a douchebag . I think you just managed to insult me twice , Spock . Alright , Spock . There 's only one question . - What 's your favorite color ? - I failed to see the relevance ... Yeah , they say it hurts less if it 's a surprise . I made an after part with which you are familiar I can confirm your theory to be horse shit . We gotta get out of here . You 're kidding me , aren 't you ? Hello there . My name is Montgomery Scott and who might you be ? Aren 't ya silly , I am pretty handy when I want you to be * what ? * Don 't come back . I am pretty sure they won 't show mercy . Hey ! That 's not fleet ... You can not just take them and ... . I 'm back , I 'm feeling generous today so have at it . Where did you get that ? - Is that English ? - I learned it from my house . Where did you get that ? - This is my Starfleet insignia . - What does it mean ? Means that I am an officer of a Starfleet , uh engineering division . - Engineering ? - Aye yes , I fix things . I know what is engineering . You are not with those who killed my ship are ya ? I take that as a no . He is Krall . Him and his bees . They searched the stars for ya . Death machine . They are the reason why you are here , why we are all here . Even those 3 scanners ? They have fallen from the sky , like me and you . Come with me . Now ! Wait , hang on a minute . I had a difficult day here . I gotta find my crewmates . I will help you find your mates and then you will help me . With what ? - You want me to fix something ? - Yes . You help me and I help you . Alright , well things have been nasty all day , and I won 't get better offer today . So lead the way . Good . I am Jaylah . - And you 're Montgomery Scott . - Aye , Scotty . Come now , Montgomery Scotty . Right , hold up . The Enterprise . It may not even have power to the bridge , Captain . She still has a few tricks up her sleeve . I bet on it . McCoy to Enterprise , come in . McCoy to Enterprise . Hey , take it easy there , Spock . That was just a temporary fix back there . I understand , Doctor . Fascinating . Ominus , dark , dangerous . We are going in . Intriguing . These symbols are the same as those that we picked on the artifact . You think it came from here ? It would seem so . Spock ! Hurry . - Aren 't we there yet ? - Stop asking that . - Sorry . - This is the way , come . Watch your steps , you do not want to set up my traps . Oh , that 's clever . What is this place ? - This is my house . - Your house ? Is this a ship ? I hope you find your friends and you help me fix it . So I can leave this planet forever . Is this your ship ? No , Montgomery Scotty . It 's yours . Oh boy . Captain , it looks like there is power . Alright , let 's get to the bridge and find the crew . The console is intacted , and I will try to reroute power to it . Work fast . Once we get this place run , we are gonna draw a lot of attention . What do you think ? You can find them ? Aye , Captain . I am reconfiguring scanners to modulate for the crews sequence . You with me . I left something behind . That is one heck of a cold . Nice job , Keenser . Alright , we got about 15 minutes until the next guard rotation . Come on . Let 's go . This is a Magellan probe . Federation is using these to find a way through the nebula . What he is using it for ? What do you see ? He 's been pinging back in a subspace links between the probes . Well , use it to send a distress signal . I am trying . Sent . He 's got the access to the Yorktown database . What ? I start to identify the files , ship files including the Enterprise . He 's been watching us this whole time . Captain the artifact was on the ship the whole time ? We did not want to get caught with it . I hid it here . Tell Krall , I have the Abornath . It 's a really sad story you hear . Not every . Put the phaser down . Please . You did it , Chekov ? Aye , Captain . I 've traced her location of her comm . What does Krall want with this thing ? To save you . From yourselves . Captain ! - You all right ? - Aye , Captain , but we are trapped . Can you get it started ? Are you intending to engage the thrusters ? I am open up for suggestions . Okay . - There 's the problem , sir . - What ? It 's a pipe . I can not get it to combust . Captain , we are basically standing on a very large bomb . If you miss the combustion compressor . I am not gonna miss , come on . Do you even know how the compressor looks like ? Yea is squared , right ? No , it 's round . That 's what I said . Chekov ! Chekov , move ! You think you know what sacrifice means ? Federation has taught you that conflict should not exist ! But without stronger , You will never know who you truly are . You have no idea who we are . But you 'll soon find out . You mean the distress signal you thought you sent ? The coordinates were altered . Your rescue ships will be stranded in the nebula and your base left , full open . You go to attack Yorktown . Millions of souls from every Federation world holding hands . It 's a perfect target . You 're wrong . We have strength in unity . The strength of others is what has kept me alive . No ! Spock ! Spock , wake up damn it ! I am entirely conscious , doctor . I am simply contemplating the nature of mortality . Feeling philosophical , huh ? Mass blood loss and do that thrill ya . You asked me why Lt. Uhura and I parted ways . I became concerned in the light of Vulcans demise and would have had a duty to my species . You thought you should be off making little Vulcans , huh ? Yup , I can see how that 'd upset her . I intended to discuss it with her further but I received some news which affected me unexpectedly . What news ? Ambassador Spock has died . Spock , I 'm so sorry . I can not imagine what that must feel like . When you lived this many lifes as he ... Fear of death is illogical . Fear of death is what keeps us alive . I want to live as he did . That is why I decided , to redirect my efforts and continue his work On New Vulcan . You are leaving Starfleet ? What did Jim had to say about that ? I could not find the time to tell him . Oh , I can tell you he is not gonna like that . Hell , I don 't know what he 'll do without ya . I mean , you know , me on the other hand . I would ... I would throw a party . My god , you get delirious . How far are we from the coordinates from that call ? Still a way , sir . Captain ? When did you begin to suspect her ? Not soon enough . How did you know ? I guess you can say I got a ... ... good knowledge for danger . Run ! Is that music ? Where the hell is that coming from ? There . I connected the middle box into the power cell with a little mouth to make it sing . That 's very clever . The music is classic , out of my taste not to mention very loud and distracting but hey , well played . I like the beats and shouting . Well you do . - Put it off . - Ah , it 's okay . Put it off ! Someone set the foot on my traps . Captain ? - You know these men ? - Aye , Classy . That 's Michael Pavel Chekov ... and that handsome is James T. Kirk . They 're my mates It 's good to see you sir . What is she doing Scotty ? You could harm them with this thing . You 're free , James T. Mr. Scott . Who 's your new friend here ? - She should have throw out the welcome mat . - This is Jaylah . I do not know what is a welcome mat . - You found anyone else ? - No , sir . I 'm sorry . You are the only ones . What the hell happened up there , Jim ? Why were we attacked ? They were after the artifact we brought back from Teenax . - Did they get it ? - No . - Have you got it ? - No . It did get off the Enterprise when it was in the shuttle . - You put it into shuttle . - Yes . And no . This is the USS Franklin , sir . Can you believe it ? The first Earth ship capable of warp 4 . Lost in Gagarin radiation belt in 2160 . I learned about it from the Academy . Captain Balthazar Edison . It was his first year in Starfleet . How the hell did the ship end up here ? There is a lot of theories , sir . Surrended to the Romulans , Captured by a giant green space hand . This matter , must be a wormhole displacement . Can you fly it ? She is missing a few drive decoyls and EPS conduits are fried ... but Jaylah has done a marvelous job getting the ship systems back online . Thank you , Montgomery Scotty . Mr. Chekov , Can you plug in the coordinates ... if you can track the crews location through the ship 's sensors ? Aye , Captain . He likes that seat . Mr. Scott , tour her . Yes . The mess hall . Jaylah , get up . Yes . No clue what happend to the crew , right ? No , sir . They would be dead 100 years by now . Is that ... ? That 's a PX-70 . My dad used to have one when I was a kid . Mom saying back there it was driving her nuts . Sir . The ship has been here this whole time and none has ever noticed it ? She stand out the image reflectors . - Alright , some sort of holographic camouflage . - Aye , sir . Captain ! I intercepted a weak communication transmission , sir , It 's a Starfleet frequency . TRANSMISSION DETECTED Can you lock on to the signal ? Yes , but how do we get to them ? I have an idea , sir , but I 'm gonna need your permission . Why would you need my permission ? Because if I 'm gonna screw up , I don 't want it to be just my fault . McCoy and Spock Enteprise crew . Come in , Enterprise crew . Anyone . Come on , Spock . Come on , we can make it . Leaving me behind will significantly increase your chances of survival , doctor . Ah that 's damn sure still leaving is completly out of question . It is imperative that you locate any surviving crew . We 're all seeking who care . Looks like care arrived I always assumed my respect for you was clear . Dialogue we have had across the years ... It 's okay , Spock . You don 't have to say it . Well , at least I won 't die alone . Well , that 's just typical . Come on ... Good to see you in one piece doctor ! Oh , am I ? I feel like my entrails were at barn days . I released old transporters only ever used for cargo but a few modifications seems to do the trick . I thought it 's best opinion when I You know , he should get displaced . Oh , I couldn 't imagine a worse scenario . Good to have you back . You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . He 's hurt . I am functioning adequately , Captain . In a pigs eye , you are . Captain , we discovered that a stolen artifact appears to come from this planet . Damn it , Spock ! - Are there any medical supplies on this thing . - This way . Lie down , come on . There you go . How are we gonna get out of this hole , Spock ? We got no ship , no crew . Knocked us out We will do what we have always done , Jim . We will find hope in the impossible . Let 's get you patched up first , okay ? Captain . You must focus your efforts on helping the crew . That 's why I need you around Spock . This things are from the dark ages . Bones . I am pretty sure this protoplaser will stop the internal haemorrhage . At least that 's my hope . The miserable have no other medicine but only hope . That 's * ? * is quoting Shakespeare . Captain 's Log , Stardate 2263.2 Losing time with them and we still do not know where the captain is . Let me take care of them . Tell me where it is . Now ! No ! Stop ! I have it , I will give you want . No , Syl ! Don 't ! Lieutenant . Unity is not your strength , it 's your weakness . We should wait until we are absolutely sure . No , we have to get the crew back , now . Chekov has the coordinates that can lead us to Krall 's base , so we go . With respect , sir , how do we know that Krall was at the base when she called . And even if he was , we do not know if and the crew is with them . Or still alive . Mr. Chekov , Can you reconfigure the search parameters in order to compensate for this formula ? Aye , I can handle it . What is this forumla ? It is vokaya , Mr. Chekov . A mineral unique to Vulcan which emits a low-level radiation . I 'll have to find if there are any energy emissions . Spock , what the hell would a Vulcan mineral be doing way out here ? Where are you going with this ? Lt. Uhura wears a vokaya amulet which I presented to her as a token of my affection and respect . You gave your girlfriend a radioactive jewelery ? The emissions is harmless , Doctor . But it 's unique signature makes it very easy to identify . You gave your girlfriend a tracking device ? That was not my intention . I am glad he doesn 't respect me . I am detecting a very trace of vokaya . Does the location match the coordinates you acquired from Kalari , Mr. Chekov ? It is a match , sir . It 's presence suggest that Lt. Uhura and there by the rest of the crew are being held at Krall 's base of operation . Can we beam them out ? No , sir . There is some geological interference that is blocking transporter signal . Well I guess are gonna have to break in the old fashion way . You can not go to this place . Everyone who goes there , he kills . You 've been there ? You 've seen it ? Why did you say something , Classy ? Because I knew you will ask me to take you there . Your friends are there then they will die , just like my family . And I will not go back to that death place . If you escaped than you can show us the way in and the way out . No ! This is not the deal we made , Montgomery Scotty . If you choose to do this , you are on your own . - Wait , wait . - Let her go . And she 's lost people too , Captain . Listen , that 's our friends out there Classy , and we can not just leave them behind . We could really use your help . You just needed to be brave as all . When we run in that place Krall will come in and take someone . There were screams , I can still hear them . And we would not see that person again it did not know who would be next . My father planed to escape . But we were seen by the by the one they call Manas . My father fought him so I could get out . He was brave ... and Manas killed him . What you want is impossible . Maybe is not . My wee Granny used to say , ye canna ' break a stick in a bundle . You 're part of something bigger now , Classy . They never gave up on you . That is what being part of crew is all about . Is that why you believe in James T. ? All I know is , we stand a better chance with you . The digging machines improved a tunnel that goes into the crater . That 's how we get out . So that 'll be our way in ? Away team at the othe side of the tunnel Follow to cross the base , get to the side of the building , to break out the crew . Captain , we can not locate anyone inside the crater in order to beam them out . Oh , I can bring up pulse beacons to path enhancers - That I get signal into the crater . - Alright . How many people can Franklin transport at the time ? With a little modification , 20 , max ... But I am not sure how long it will hold out . Bones , Mr. Chekov and Jaylah , would be in the away team . Mr Scott , modify the transporter and do whatever you can to make this ship operational . Captain , Mr. Chekov 's technical acumen makes him more valuable onboard the Franklin with Mr. Scott . Is there by logical that I would replace him . Why is that logical Spock ? You just got back on your feet . Lt. Uhura 's in that facility , Jim . I 'll keep an eye on him . Understood . His soldiers are everywhere . We won 't pass unseen . What we require is a diversion . I think I have an idea . This is Abornath . It was used by the ancient once as a weapon But when they could not control its deadly power they split it into two ... And ejected the halves into space . Hoping it will be lost forever . But I am grateful I have spent lifetime searching for And only to have you find it for me . The poetry of fate . The world that I was born into is very different from yours , Lieutenant . We knew pain , we knew terror . Struggle , made us strong . Not peace , not unity . These are myths the Federation make you believe . Those are strong words . You may even believe them . But there 's something else going on with you . Something underneath . Wait . What are you doing with her ? You already got what you want then let her go ! No ! Manas . It 's time . The Federation has pushed the frontier for centuries . But no longer . This is where it begins , Lieutenant . This is where the frontier , pushes back . This way . Where is she ? My god , this is hell of a distraction . Your friends are over there . Come on . Commander wait ! Krall , take the weapon and continue the mission . Go ! Commander , Uhura , they took her . Get ready and take the crew to safety . Come on . Let 's go . Move . - I 've got them , Mr Scott . - Okay , Mr. Chekov . Release the signal . We are gonna grab them 20 at a time . - Aye . - Let 's hope this doesn 't get messy . Energize ! Spock ! What are you doing here ? Clearly , I am here to rescue you . Let 's go . Good to see you good man . You 'll die here as your father . Ten seconds until transporters recharged , doctor . Wait for my signal . - Doctor ! - Damn it man , we are not leaving without them ! Hang on ! Let 's go ! Move ! move ! We are ready for you next captain , just turn on your beacon . - Scotty , you have everybody ? - Aye , sir . Everyones here except you and Jeylah . Start the beacon and we will grab ya . Your friends abandoned you . Captain , your beacon ! - There it is ! - Energize ! Jaylah ! Okay , let 's never do that again . Aye , James T. You all right ? Captain this thing he has ... Yorktown . He 's gonna destroy Yorktown . You take my house and you make it fly . Mr. Scotty , can you get this thing started ? Well start it , yes . Flying sir , that 's a different thing . These old vessel , they were built in space . They were never supposed to take off from the atmosphere . Make it happen . They are called Starships sir , for a reason . Why you tell me this now ? Because I didn 't want to disappoint ya . You know , in case we didn 't make it back . How thoughtful , Mr. Scott . Captain . He is launching . The attack at the Yorktown may be just the beginning . With this bioweapon he could get rid of all life and use the bases advanced technology to attack an untold number of Federation planets . We are just gonna have to get this thing flying . We can not just junk start it , sir . Okay , all systems are online . Dilithium chambers at 70 % and raising . Main * something * subwarp engines standing by . Mr. Sulu . You can ... You know fly this thing , right ? You kidding me , sir ? Fantastic . Scotty , how are we looking ? Ready as she will never be , sir . That 's what I like to hear . Alright . Bones , where are we with the crew ? I could use a functioning med bay , but otherwise we are secure and clear . Mr. Sulu . We have to achieve a terminal velocity , in order for the stabilizers to provide lift . Are you sure this drop is high enough to do that ? We 'll find out . Call it , Mr. Sulu . Aye aye , Captain . Mr. Chekov , be ready to hit the front stabilizers full on my mark . One quarter Impulse Right . - One half impulse , Mr. Chekov . - Aye . We should belt down . Come on , move move ! Easy , Mr. Sulu . Let 's not break her now . Anytime , Mr. Sulu . Now , Mr. Chekov . I have an alert on incoming vessel . No reply on all frequency ID request . Visual . Red alert ! Red alert ! Look how far they 've come . * Some kind of alert * We received distress signals on all frequencies from Yorktown . Krall is already starting the attack . Mr. Scott , what kind of weapons do we have ? We have pulse phased cannons and spatial torpedoes . Great . Lock and load . That does not matter . You can no defeat the bees . Maybe , maybe we will lore them away . How do we get Yorktown time to get people to safety ? We are on course and buggy competitors . We are barely holding together as it is , Captain . Captain . The flight paterns of bees are determined by individual decisions . Krall 's form formations are to complex not to rely on some form of unified psychopathic coordination . - I suggest that ... - Spock . Skip to the end . What he is saying that if we disorient the swarm we can kick it 's ass . Precisely . Scotty , can you beam me onto one of those swarm ships ? Have you gone completly mad ? - Yes or no ? - No . Yes . Maybe . Captain , my familiarity with the interior of those ships , however brave makes me more qualified for this away mission . Spock , you 're still hurt . She 's right , Spock . I acknowledge with respect your concerns . Perhaps you will feel more confident if I were accompanied by someone with familiarity of both the ship and my injury . He 's gonna love this . You want me to do what ? Of the crew , only 3 remain . I will only die . The entities abandoned this planet long ago . They left behind sophisticated mining equipment and a drone platforms . They had some sort of technology that prolongs life . I 'll do whatever it takes for me and my crew . The Federation do not care about us . Probably never see me again but if you do be ready . Why has he not used his weapon yet ? Because he wants to find somewhere to impact with maximum damage . He needs a ventilation system . Circulating area , right ? Aye , sir . There 's a atmospheric regulator core . Lieutenant , contact Yorktown make sure they shut it down before it finds Krall . How we access the core ? Well , there is a maintenance tower at the stations gravitational nexus . That 's the only way . Scotty , get over there and make sure it gets shutdown . Classy , with me . That mechanism is impossible to shut down . Alright , well . Let 's see about that . Mr. Scott , why is that thing still on ? I 'm working on that , sir , but as you can imagine there 's a lot of safety protocols , so ... I need to think that you know keeps everybody alive . Find something out . Be careful captain . A gravity is gonna get a bit screwy the closer you get to the center . We should scan the operations schematics . See if there is a backdoor . Classy , I 'm gonna need your eyes . What happened when you were out there ... Edison . Edison ? I have to say Kirk I missed being me . We lost ourselves , But gained a purpose . It means to bring the galaxy a struggle that made humanity strong . I think you underestimate humanity . I fought for humanity ! We lost millions with the Xindi and Romulan wars . And for what ? For the Federation to sit in the captain 's chair . And play brat with the enemy ? We change . We have to . We spend the rest of our lives fighting the same battles . You 've lost ! You know you can not get back there . You are out . Like you did ? I read your simple log . Captain James T. Kirk . At least I know who I am . I 'm a soldier . You won the war , Edison . You gave us peace . Peace ... It 's not a world I was born into . - Scotty . - Captain . He is using the gravitational slitch to get back to the center . No ! Weapon 's in the chamber . Captain we have to stop the processor or everything breathing in Yorktown is dead . You can 't stop it . You will die . I 'd rather die saving lives Than to live with taking them . That 's what I was born into . - Scotty . - Captain , I think we can redirect it . There 's a seal construction , perhaps that will let you vent the weapon into space . Now we can override the locks , from out here , but you have to activate the hatch . - Isn 't there any button ? - It 's not a button . It 's a simple lever under the white panel . - Got it . - And there 's 4 of them . Once you have activated lock , there should quitting immediately . If the hatch is opened when the CPU starts next cycle you are gonna get sucked into space . What happens when the hatch isn 't opened ? You are gonna get sucked into big fan . With the weapon and we all die . Dammit , Jim , you won 't make it out on time . The fan . Get out of there , James T. Scotty , the last hatch won 't open . - Scotty . - Work fast , Captain . Time is running out . He is not gonna make it . What would I do without you , Spock ? For decades , the Federation thought that he was a hero . I guess time would judge us all . He just got lost . You saved this entire base , Kirk . Millions of souls . Thank you . It wasn 't just me . Never is . It 's easy to say that the position of Vice Admiral , it 's yours . No one deserves it more . Vice Admirals don 't fly do they ? No . They don 't . No offense , ma 'am but where 's the fun in that ? You didn 't even try to get our time reduced ? Why would I get it reduced ? Bones , we know our way through the nebula now . Can you imagine , what we 'll find ? Alien deathspots , Calvenom killing us . Deadly space worm , viruses and bacteria . Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies that could wipe us out in an instant . It 's gonna be so much fun . By the way , where 're we going ? I thought we were gonna get drink . I know you told me to keep it under wraps , but ... Happy birthday ! This was it ? Thanks , Scotty . Everybody raise your glass to Captain James T. Kirk . - Captain Kirk . - Thanks , everybody . - To the Enterprise ... - To the Enterprise . ... and to absent friends . Cheers . Alright , let 's get this party started . I thought you have to finish your mission report . I do . But I thought it would be more pleasing to engage with you socially . You old romantic . Do you know that scotch was actually invented by little lady in Russia ? Excuse me . Did you drink all those yourself ? I am impressed . Someone said that it will take my edge off . My edge is still not off . Alright , gold , maybe this will help . Captain pulled a few strings . That is the acceptance to the Starfleet Academy , if you want to . We have a lot rules . No less , no more . Will I have to wear that uniform ? I 'm afraid so . Hey , Keenser . Kevin , is there no way you wear pants ? I heard about Ambassador Spock . Is that what you wanted to mention that time during the tribunal ? More or less . I trust your meeting with Commodore Paris went well . More or less . You really want to head back out there , huh ? Space , the final frontier . These are voyagers of the starship Enterprise . It 's continuing mission to explore strange new worlds To seek out new life and new civilizations To boldly where no man has gone before . * * * SUBTITLES by CharlieX3 * * * * * * improved by Airun _ 71 * * *

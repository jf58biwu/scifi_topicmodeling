 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... We need to find Skye . Hydra 's new heads ... Strucker and List . They 're researching powered people . We 're making a deal ... With Ward . We are working with Director Coulson . You 're gonna do whatever he says . I 'm more than happy to comply . Jiaying : I 'll have him taken away from here . I 'll talk to him . I 'll soften the blow . You were gonna dump me here like yesterday 's trash . Skye ? Coulson ? I need to get you out of here . No , no , no , no ! No ! Damn it ! I had her . Deathlok 's down . Hydra 's storming the building . Your call , boss . Take me to your leader . [ gasps , breathing heavily ] What are ... Were you watching me ? I didn 't mean to startle you . I heard you calling out . I was asleep . Yes . And dreaming . Do you want to tell me about it ? Lincoln said you 'd been having nightmares . Lincoln ... He was actually in this dream , Being held somewhere , being hurt . It felt ... Real . [ electricity crackles ] Excuse me . Cal : Where 's my wife ? ! Ahh ! Didn 't expect to see me back here so soon , Not after such a well-planned banishing ! Where 's Lincoln ? You took me from my home . All right , that 's enough ! Cal , this isn 't your home . I know that now . Hey ! Lincoln is still out there . Gordon , can you please ? [ electricity crackles ] What happened ? Can we please get back to what matters here ? You tried to take me away from our daughter . It 's unacceptable ! Go calm down , Cal . You and I can discuss this later . There are worse options . [ sighs ] Are you okay ? I 'm fine . But Coulson was there . [ electricity crackles ] It was Hydra . I tried stopping them . I barely got away . They took Lincoln . Robert . It 's good to see you . It 's good to see my bus , but , hey , you look well , too . Why turn yourself in now , Phil ? Strucker and List have been running experiments On enhanced people . They 've set up a base in the Arctic . I have a man on the inside who fed us their location . I can 't trust you . Then trust the mission . Robert , don 't let this be about you and me . The one thing we still have ... Both of us ... is stopping Hydra . Don 't we ? What 's your proof ? Firsthand ... List took Mr. Peterson . Deathlok , the thing Hydra created . Mike Peterson , an ally . He 's been working for me . This is not helping your case . We have a chance to hit Hydra ... hard . They 're operating on powered people . We can shut that down and save lives . Perhaps , but I 'm gonna ask again ... Why should I trust you ? Because we all have our secrets . You have one sitting in the cargo hold of your ship , But I 'm still willing to work with you . How do you know that ? Because it 's in this box , Which I will open for you if you trust me . Skye : I don 't understand . Why was Lincoln there ? I asked him to go and protect you , to keep you safe . It was a mistake . I should never have let you go at all . We have to make sure that the Cal that we put out into the world Is the same cal that I 've seen here ... Th-The safe and user-friendly Cal . You were trying to make it easy on him . You were being compassionate . How do we get Lincoln back ? We don 't . It 's too much of a risk . You don ... You don 't understand . They will torture him . They will kill him . I know exactly what Hydra is capable of doing . I 've carried the memory of what they did for decades . I 'm sorry . And I wish I could save lincoln from that , But I suspect somehow Hydra is tracking Gordon 's movements . Anyone I send will be at risk , too . And Lincoln wouldn 't want me to . These people are important to him . He wouldn 't want them to risk their lives . We can 't rescue Lincoln ... Not now . I 'm sorry . [ Lincoln groans ] What the hell ? Welcome back . Who 's there ? Deathlok : We didn 't get to formally meet . I think we got knocked out together . You 're the guy with the parts . [ tools whirring ] You know where we are ? No . At least they haven 't killed us yet . But there are bodies out there . Oh , great . You got all that hardware . Use one of those weapons and get us out of here . Right . Because I didn 't think of that . At least your sarcasm still works . [ motor whirs ] They disabled the arm . It 's dead . What about that teleporting guy ? He coming to help us out ? I hope not . I think they 're tracking him . He 'd put all my people at risk . Yeah . My people are just as outmatched . Only they 're stupid enough to try it . So if we want out of here , we got to do it ourselves . I 'm Lincoln . Thank you , doctor . Hail Hydra . [ cellphone beeps ] Well , Strucker 's most pleased with our progress . And he 's very anxious to see the subjects with his own eyes . They are an interesting contrast , these two . This one , the one they call Deathlok ... His modifications are mechanical , Bestowed by science , by man . And the other ? His oddities are intrinsic , Somehow bestowed upon him by nature . Yes . But knowing the difference Is not the same thing as re-creating it . And to that end , I hope to ... To isolate the genetic component , yes . A comparison between the two could be invaluable . Dr. Whitehall believed discovery requires experimentation . I do miss him . As do I. But the world moves on , And we form new allegiances . I 'm very glad to hear that ... Especially as we proceed with the experimentation . Here we go . That 's your plan ? I take it from your expression , you 're not dazzled . Why send a small infiltration unit ? Why not a full-on assault ? Blow the base to particles . I 'd rather not sacrifice the prisoners . Rescue is ideal . We don 't even know how many people hydra 's holding . I 'm not sure I 'm willing to put my people at risk . I 've already got my own people picked out . [ sighs ] How you feeling ? Nauseous . Mm . You want me to get ... Oh , no , not from getting shot . That 's nothing . It 's those two . I think they actually ... Like each other . Just , um , just focus on your wound . It 'll be less unsettling . You want to take the stick ? I could teach you . Come on . I think you 'd like to fly . No . No . If I fly , I 'm taking us to Mykonos or Kauai . So , you don 't like our plan ? Grant , S.H.I.E.L.D. Makes me nervous . Didn 't you already fulfill your promise to Coulson ? But not my promise to you . There 's still one more thing I need from him Before this is over . [ cellphone rings ] [ cellphone beeps ] Yeah . Green light ! Go ! Gonzales : Agent May . May : Sir . Welcome back . Ward : Nice to be back . You 'll be accompanied by guards at all times . Each of whom will shoot you without hesitation . May : Remember that . May 's actually pretty friendly ... Once you get to know her . You finally come back , And you bring grant ward onto the base . I hope this plan of yours works . You and me both . This video feed was streamed From Deathlok 's eye less than an hour ago . [ static ] What happened ? It appears Hydra removed his eye . Well , we 've got a problem . Without Deathlok 's feed , We don 't have eyes on the ground . I have a man working on the inside ... Sunil Bakshi . I know Bakshi . He 's a Hydra agent . Not anymore . Now he works for me . Says the Hydra agent . My days with hydra are over . Just an independent contractor trying to make amends . We remain skeptical . With good cause , but I believe using Bakshi Is the only way for us to successfully infiltrate this base . The base is in the arctic circle With nothing around for miles . Which is why it 's critical I take in a small team . Weaver : And just to be clear , Agent Coulson , What is your objective here ? We rescue the enhanced prisoners , Then disable the missile-defense system So that S.H.I.E.L.D. Jets can fly in safely To bomb the facility . You really believe a small team can do this ? My team can . Then I suppose we should put this matter to a vote . Agent Morse . I 'm in . Agents Weaver and Oliver . No . Too risky . I agree . Gonzales : Understood . But I 'm voting to go ahead with this . That leaves you with the deciding vote , Agent May . I 'd like a word in private with Agent Coulson first . You look upset . Is everything okay ? I feel sorry for her . Yeah , well , should 've seen her back on the plane with Ward . Seems the two of them are in love with each other . Whatever that is , it 's not love . [ scoffs ] No . Of course not . Hey , thank you for packing the sandwich before I left . It was really delicious . Oh . You 're quite welcome . But I just don 't understand Why Coulson would take Ward on a mission . It 's simply too dangerous . Yeah . For Ward , maybe . I attacked him back on the Quinjet . Hunter had to pull me off him , so ... Really ? Yeah , yeah . You know , what I should 've done is tossed him from the plane . Yeah , that would 've been fitting , But perhaps there 's a better way still . Simply find Ward alone , stick one of these on , And poof ... No more Ward . Yeah , that probably would be quite a fitting way for , um ... Wait . Ward is a threat to every agent working in S.H.I.E.L.D. Isn 't it our responsibility To at least arm ourselves against him ? May : What the hell are you thinking ? I could ask you the same thing . Since when did you become A high-ranking member of Team Gonzales ? Someone had to run the base while you were gone . Having a seat allowed me to keep you safe . I was fine on my own . Seems that 's how you operate best . That you 've been lying to me ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. Fell . All those overseas trips you were taking , They were never about recruiting new agents , were they ? You want to tell me what theta protocol is ? Because you 're not the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Neither are you . Not anymore . We 've always had our secrets , May . You had a secret line to fury behind my back . This ... Is personal . This is about Andrew . He 's my ex-husband . And you were working with him ... Behind my back . I went to him for counseling . He was the only therapist I could talk to About my alien-writing impulses . You should 've told me . You 're right . And I will apologize to you later , at length . But right now , list has Mike Peterson And who knows how many other enhanced prisoners . Now can we put this behind us and go rescue them ? Please ? What part of " No " didn 't you understand ? The part where you won 't take me to Lincoln . I told you , no one enters Or leaves afterlife until we know it 's safe . S.H.I.E.L.D. May be wrong about a lot of things , But they never leave a man behind . I 'm sorry ... Raina : Don 't give up hope just yet . Skye can save Lincoln . I saw her do it . Wh ... you 've seen it ? We think Raina 's gift may allow her To see things before they happen . I thought her gift was spinning really fast To collect gold rings . Tell me what you saw . Raina : Maybe she 's right . What I saw doesn 't make much sense . Why would Coulson be working with Ward ? C-Coulson and Ward were together back at Cal 's office , But I didn 't ... Tell anyone . You have to go . You do go . Lincoln 's in a dark room with two doctors . They 're cutting into him . You 're the only one who can save him . You have to take me . I promised Jiaying I wouldn 't use my gift . You need permission to save a friend ? Last time I went back for Lincoln , Hydra almost captured me . Because where you take Skye is a long way from Hydra . You 're taking this too far . It 's the only way we can move forward . I 'll go help my team while you stay here and reconnect with your past . That made sense when it was just calling my mom . This is something else entirely . Listen , you 're a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent , Kara . I was a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent ... A long time ago ... Before Hydra took me ... Before I met you . Being a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent was taken from you . This is your chance to get that part of yourself back . And I 'll keep saying it until you believe me . All you have to do is stay strong . Morse : If you didn 't want me to go , Then why did you vote to allow it ? Because Coulson 's only using his own people . Figured it was worth the risk . Those are S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents going on that mission , Robert . I 'm aware of that , Agent Morse . We 're fighting a war with an enemy that is without honor . Sometimes , we make sacrifices for the greater good . Excuse me , sir , but I 'd like to join the mission . I appreciate the offer , Agent Simmons , But this is a specialized team . Agent may is there for tactical support , Fitz to disable the defense systems ... And who 's there to look after Mike 's injuries ? Ward ? Hydra 's already removed Mike 's eye . God knows what else they 've done to him . He 'll need a doctor , and preferably one Already familiar with Deathlok 's anatomical structure . You sure about this ? Absolutely . This is something I have to do . Suit up . [ motor whirring ] [ electricity crackles ] On your knees , now . May , this isn 't me . Skye . Hey , guys . We finally got the team back together . How are they all ? Are you making friends ? How did you get the intel about the base ? Can you control your powers , or ... ? Yes , I-I promise I will tell you guys everything . You might not believe me , but just not now . Well , we 're just happy to see you , And you 're being so secretive . No , I 'm happy to see you , too , but ... Yeah , we 've got a mission to do , not much time , Blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . I don 't want to talk about anything personal In case he 's just ... Did I hear my name ? He 's like Candyman . We should review the op . Ward ... Can 't believe I 'm saying this Bring us up to speed on Bakshi 's intel . Ward : All right . Bakshi 's using old Hydra text channels To provide us with intel , although m ... Much of it is , uh ... Much ... All right . Can we just address the elephant on the plane ? I know . This is weird . Mistakes were made . By you . And people got hurt . By you . And I could stand here and explain again how my parents And brother left me vulnerable ... We all had our traumas , Ward . Didn 't turn any of us into psychopaths . Well , we all have our own ways of coping , don 't we ? For example , I was yours . Watch it , Ward . Look , I 'm just saying we all made mistakes . Coulson handed me over to my abuser ... thank you . Skye shot me ... after you killed how many people ? Yeah , and we were a team and a family , and you betrayed us . I know . It 's what I regret the most . Not the lying , the S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents I had to put down , And ... I 'm sorry ... not even dropping you two in the ocean . It 's this . My actions destroyed this . I 'll regret that forever . 'cause there were good times . Right ? Before ? I mean , for a while there , We were a good team . Weren 't we ? I 'm still happy I shot you . Yeah , me too . Should 've aimed for the face . Yeah . Guys ... I know this is so weird , But we have to come back to the mission . Two teams . Skye , ward , and simmons on rescue and medical . Fitz and I will break in to missile defense And gather intel . May 's with us for firepower . Wait . You 're not on rescue ? Let me handle the job assignments . The point is , there 's a lot of challenges ahead . We don 't want to implode before we even get there . And , Ward , just ... No more talking ... To people . You 've been pacing , haven 't you ? Why would you assume ... Come with me . I shouldn 't have come back so hot . I didn 't count to 10 . I ... I am better . I promise . I 'm sorry . It wasn 't right to send you away , Certainly not without telling you . Probably not at all . I understand . Actually , you know , I don 't . I-I don 't understand . Why did you send me away ? Everything is so dangerous right now . I felt I had to . I ... You had that thing you 've got ... Butterflies in the stomach , except in the heart . You were stressed . Why don 't you stay for now ? We can let everything calm down , and then we can figure it out . Thank you , thank you . You know , I-I was pacing a little . I don 't want to lie . It really will be the three of us together , Just like we wanted . There are always threats . What can you tell me about her ? She 's manipulative , dangerous , deceitful . We had good times . You need to watch her . What are you doing ? Not everyone is gonna be able to see the mission in real-time ... In Coulson 's ... In the office . So I figure the rest could watch here . [ groans ] If you don 't want my help ... No , no , no . It 's ... It 's cool . Thanks . I 'm sorry , man . For everything . I did what I thought was right . I still do , but I ... I never meant for you to get hurt . I get it . It 's the line of work . You had a tough call to make . I maybe wish you 'd chained me up somewhere Not in a men 's restroom , but ... I swear I looked for any other place ... The point is , Mack , I forgive you . R-really ? Thanks . Look , I promise you , When everything settles down around here , Next round of drinks is on me . [ chuckles ] A round of drinks ? Really ? You choked me out and kidnapped me . A round of drinks is the first thing In a long , long , long list of things you 're gonna do for me . [ laughing ] All right . All right ? Yeah . Yeah ? Whatever it takes . You talk to Bobbi yet ? No , not yet . Morse : It 's funny . Don 't mind blood , but needles ? I 'm trying not to look at any of it , But this isn 't really about tests , right ? This is you guys keeping an eye on me where I can 't leave . Better than a cell , I guess . Plus , we want to make sure they didn 't mess with you physically . Just ... Messed with my head . I know . How much do you remember ? From before ? Pieces , missing some details . You know , you and I actually met a few times . So I 'm here for you . If you start remembering , come to me . I 'll help you out . Thank you . You 're the first one here to speak to me like a person . What Whitehall did to you ... It 's unthinkable . Yeah . But at least one good thing came out of it . I met Grant . [ clears throat ] No , just wait . He 'll get Bakshi to help . You 'll see the Grant I do . I doubt they 'll survive . That 's a crushing disappointment , really . No one has made it past this stage of our experiments With alien enhancement . Well , no one other than the twins , of course . And Strucker has them in Segovia . Oh , it would be so nice If they were not our only viable subjects . Well , perhaps he will prove the answer . He 's due in surgery about now . Man : Dr. List . A cloaked plane is on approach . Cloaked ? But how can you see it ? It 's the barren location . We see a blip , even a cloaked one . It must be S.H.I.E.L.D. Shoot them out of the sky . Yes , sir . We 've been spotted . It 's time . [ alarm blaring ] I 've got visuals on the target . Buckle in . They 've locked on . Satellite confirms that S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6 has been hit . Any contact from Coulson 's team ? I 'm afraid not . Sit tight . This was always the plan . I 'm starting to think this wasn 't a very good plan ! Is there anything you can do about the drop ? ! Not if we want Hydra to believe we 're debris ! I 'm really starting to wish I hadn 't eaten that hot pocket earlier . Hold on ! S.H.I.E.L.D. 2-1-8 has eased its decent And is making preparations to land . That was the easy part . Clear . [ bones snapping ] I was being followed . Calm your mind , Bakshi . Your compliance will be rewarded . Good to see you again , sir . Where 's Kara ? Exactly where she needs to be . Is list still here ? Yes , sir . In the lab , along with the other prisoners . And the mainframe room ? Down the hall , to the left . Everyone clear on their team 's objective ? If it 's agreeable , I 'd prefer to join Agent Ward 's team . Is that gonna be a problem ? Coulson : Remember , just 15 minutes Till Gonzales ' jets arrive . Move . Be careful , Jemma . [ keypad beeping ] [ gunfire ] Just like old times , huh ? Not exactly . So that 's what happened in Puerto Rico . The least you can do is thank me . How about I just don 't try to kill you again ? It 's not as bad as it looks . Really ? No . It 's pretty bad . There 's another guy in here . He had electrical powers . Lincoln ? Yeah . They moved him just before you showed . You need to hurry . The guy 's in pretty bad shape . We 're coming in . [ monitors beeping ] You 're up . Don 't just stand there like an idiot . Go and find something we can carry him out on . Surprised you 'd sign up for any mission with ward involved . I saw an opportunity to do the right thing , so I took it . [ gun clicks ] [ flatline ] Lincoln ... Lincoln , wake up . [ electricity crackles ] [ monitors beeping ] [ breathes deeply ] Oh , my god . Raina was right . Sir , watch out ! Aah ! Aah ! We 're on the same team . What were you thinking ? That I made you a promise . What ? That you would kill me ? I thought we moved past that . Go on . Get it over with , you monster . You really have changed , Simmons . I 'm disappointed in you . [ breathes unsteadily ] [ door closes ] Okay , missile defenses are almost down . Good . Where 's Coulson ? S.H.I.E.L.D. Jets are five minutes from the target . Have them await my command . Any word from Coulson 's team ? Not yet . Get out of there , Phil . Hey , need to move . Just one minute . Come on , Phil , this wasn 't the plan . Or was it ? [ door opens ] Either come with me now , or you 're next . Okay . After you . Is he okay ? Where are Ward and Bakshi ? They 're not coming with us . Okay . Come on . We don 't have much time . May : This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 2-1-8 . We have the prisoners and are leaving Hydra airspace . Yes . All right . Well done , Coulson . Agent Weaver , have our jets fire when ready . Be careful ! [ cellphone rings ] [ cellphone beeping ] Ward : Sounds like you made it out okay . I 'm surprised you didn 't join us . I thought it might be in my best interest To find an exit that wouldn 't , oh , Land me in a cell afterwards . Or , you know , my brain erased . Well , I 'm glad you made it out all right . Yeah , we both know that 's not true , Coulson . You want to tell me what this call 's really about ? I always knew the team wasn 't gonna forgive me . Some people just don 't deserve forgiveness . But Kara ? She does . That 's why I 've returned her to S.H.I.E.L.D. Ward , there 's ... She was a good agent ... A good person . Then Hydra ambushed her safe house And took that from her ... Took everything . Whitehall broke her , and I 've tried to fix her , but I 'm just not the right man for it . Just not enough good left inside me . She deserves better . I 'll see what I can do . I know you 'll do the right thing . [ cellphone beeps ] Fitz : Hydra didn 't just disconnect your leg . It 's , like ... It 'll take serious man-hours to reattach it . I wish I had the equipment to fix it here . Just tell me someone does . There 's a facility . So they 'll be ready for you straightaway . How 'd you guys find us , anyway ? Bakshi , if you can believe it . Ward got him to lead us right in . Yeah ? I didn 't see Bakshi . What happened to him ? He didn 't make it . [ monitors beeping ] [ breathes deeply ] Come on , Lincoln . Wake up . Morse : Sir , the attack team 's on their way back . They report the entire Hydra base has been destroyed . There was no sign of this Dr. List . He may have escaped . Sir ? Are you ... Are you okay ? She 's still dangerous . We 're all dangerous . She 's in our custody , and we got what we wanted . What we wanted ? Enhanced people here on the base . That 's why you were willing to go along with Coulson 's plan . You wanted the enhanced people he 'd rescue . I didn 't expect Skye , But we have her and one of her friends . Maybe we can learn how many are out there . You 're gonna hold Skye here ? I think that we need to discuss this . Coulson : Discuss what ? What are we discussing now ? Time to honor our agreement . Here you go . Unlocked and all yours . Go nuts . At least until fury shows up and asks for it back . Oh . Spoiler alert . [ cellphone rings ] Oh . Hey . I have to take this . [ cellphone beeps ] Hi . Can you hang on a second ? Hill : I bet Gonzales wasn 't happy When you said he wasn 't invited to this chat . Yeah , well , I wasn 't too happy When he blew a hole in my base and kicked me out . We all live with disappointment , And right now , we have bigger problems . Does that mean you found it ? I figured you 'd visit me again . I spoke to gordon . I think we should discuss your visions . Specifically , I 'd like to discuss How you used them to convince Skye To run off and rescue Lincoln . I didn 't convince Skye . I just told her what was gonna happen . It was dangerous and it was foolish , And it won 't happen again . From now on , any decisions based on your gift Will be made by me . It 's funny . I was just thinking , who decided You should have final say in all the decisions around here ? Raina ... Maybe the time has come for someone else to ... [ gasps ] I 'm guessing Hydra doesn 't know Loki 's scepter was the weapon that killed me , But I bet they know it can control minds . In their hands , that 's catastrophic . Coulson , please tell me you know where it is . I 'm pretty sure list is headed there right now . Raina . Raina , talk to me . I see ... A Scepter . Beautiful ... Dangerous ... It isn 't finished yet . So much destruction . [ gasps ] I 've just sent you everything I found on Strucker 's location . Coulson , why didn 't you just tell Gonzales Why you really wanted to get onto the Hydra base ? Believe it or not , he puts every decision to a vote . [ scoffs ] I know . And I was pretty sure if I 'd been honest , I 'd have lost the swing vote , so I did what I had to do . Last thing . Theta protocol ... Is it ready ? Yes , it is . Time to bring in the Avengers . It 's terrible . Jiaying , it was ... What ? What was it ? Consequences are upon us . Men made of metal will tear our cities apart . And the world will be changed forever .

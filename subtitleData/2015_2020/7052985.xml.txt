 We escaped in a boat with only a map and compass . You said you would cure me if I helped you . I think I can help you find Helena . What are you doing here ? Do you remember this guy ? Ian Van Lier . According to Adele , they 're all funneling funds into a Dyad shell , which has made payments of hundreds of millions of dollars . What are they using that for ? Bribes ? - Controlled by this man here . - Hashem Al-Khatib . John Patrick Matheson . He 's not 170 . - Let 's go , Siobhan . - Thank you . Ugh ! Ferdinand , you came back . How did you know ? Oh , shit . I passed out . Sorry . Is there any movement out there ? Not a thing . It 's too quiet . I 'm not ... I 'm not ... I don 't like it . What 's not to like ? Our friends are coming .

I never really think about that anymore . Yeah , they 'll be safe with my ex . Plus , my daughter will get a kick out of it . I don 't get it . Why aren 't the Neos after us ? Enger 's AWOL too . There 's no one on me . Rachel must have shown the Cabal our proof of P.T. ' s real identity . Those men on the board , they 're realizing they 've been had . They 're scrambling to protect themselves . So finally , Rachel 's their target ? Well , she 's certainly a liability . Come on . Let 's go , guys . OK , here 's one . " There is nothing I wouldn 't do for my friends . " I have no notion of doing things by halves . It 's not my nature . " You guess who that is ? It is Jane ... - Austen . - Ha ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . It 's just all this info from Europe shows a dozen countries have pending legislation like Kuwait 's . Hundreds of millions of people are about to be required to submit their DNA , and Neolution is behind it . - They need that data . - OK , so you want to spend the morning safeguarding the genetic future of humankind - or do you wanna have brunch ? - We have a Skype date . Siobhan wants a summit . You 're calling them or what ? They 're calling us ! " Us " ? Why are you so bloody calm ? Oh , wait for it , chicken . Hello , North American scum ! We bought - a shit mountain of cheese . - Welcome back ! - Hello ! - Hey , you 're home . Yeah . Did you forget ? Tonight 's my big coming out party . Your art opening . An art opening ? Do ... do you think that 's a good idea right now ? - No ! - Yes . It 's an exceptional idea ! And I 'm really sorry that you can 't come close . - What ? Why can 't I come ? - How are you gonna come ? You 're gonna dress up as Sarah ? This is my first show in two years ; I 'm not gonna have any kind of sestra shenanigans . I can 't do it . He 's got some big wheels coming in . Ezra Lue , this gallerist that we met in Geneva . Adele 's making appetizers . The Hendrix are helping set up . And you can totally come later if you want to , I promise . I do . I do want to come . But , Mom , if P.T. ' s lost the board , that means - Neolution 's on the ropes . - Yeah , so well done , everyone . Felix and Adele , dirt well dug . Delphine , you showed us what to do with it . And we deserve a breather tonight to stand down and support Felix . I think you 're right , Siobhan . I think we 've earned a break . - Have we ? - Well , it 's settled . We 're gonna take the day off from crazy . Thank you for letting me stay . I don 't have a family anymore ; I didn 't know where else to go . What ? When did Mark die ? Two weeks ago . How did you find me again ? Well , you told me about Sister Irena , how she ... fed you when the other nuns locked you up and how she came to the New World after they cut out her tongue . You don 't trust me ? ♪ I don 't blame you - after what my father did to you . - He is dead . These are miracle babies . I 'm sorry I came . I 'll go . You still have family . ♪ You see ? They remember you . They 're saying hello . Alright . - Uh , how 's Helena over here , Aly ? - It 's fine with me ! Yeah , but left ? Right ? Like , where should she be - in relation to her sisters ? - Whatever you think . OK , this is a test , right ? I 'm gonna do something and then you 're gonna - lambast me for doing it wrong ? - No ! I 'm not gonna micromanage you , Donnie . Is that what you 're wearing ? What 's wrong with this ? Should I untuck ? Would that be cooler ? Donnie is perfect . I need a straight man - behind the bar . - Thank God , you 're here , Felix ! - Thank you . But you can 't be . - What ? ! - Yeah . - You need your sisters - and I have a performance idea . - Yeah , she brought the Korg . Oh , God , no . You ready for that whiskey , Adele ? Oh , hell , yes ! Just three fingers , please . OK , we 're not done here . We need to still go - after this Al-Khatib guy . - The Neo bagman ? He controls their slush fund . I mean , he 's so protected , it 's not even funny . If he is bribing governments for citizens ' genetics , then we 've got to ... Leave it , love , will you ? Why don 't you help Adele - with the snacks . - Oh , that would be great ! I 'm going southern regional . We can catch up . Great ! See you both at the opening . - Where are you off to ? - I 'm just gonna get some flowers . - Mom ! - Chicken . You are a warrior , and I 've told you everything I know . And you 're right , we can 't stand down yet . But that 's exactly why I need you at the opening . Look out for your brother , make sure there 's no trouble . OK , so that 's 144 prepared doses - of the inoculate . - Yeah . And depending how much of the cellular culture survived , we can manufacture twice that again . Then what ? You go around inoculating leaders with it ? Yeah . That 's the plan . But we still don 't know how many there are . Well , that 's what we 're gonna find out . - Right , Scotty ? - OK . - Where are you going ? - Uh , out . I thought we were all heading over to Felix 's together . - I 'll catch you guys later , OK ? - Sure . We have this whole " don 't-ask don 't-tell " thing going on . Ciao . Hey . - You 're ready ? - Are you sure about this ? Wouldn 't it be safer if the others knew ? We have one shot at this , and if it 's gonna work , Sarah can 't know who we dealt with to get here . - What about after ? - After , you go to the opening like nothing happened and I will send you instructions there . - Are we good ? - Yeah . OK . I so love being in the middle of all of this . ♪ Oh ... Rachel . Rachel is rather impressed with our transgressive - little alliance , aren 't you ? - It made me sick to work with the man who killed M.K. Sarah doesn 't know you two - are here , does she ? - No , it 's just the four of us . And our interests are very firmly aligned as you now have a nice , big , fat target on your back , too . ♪ So ... Neolution goes down for good , - or we all do . - This is a summary of the evidence we 've amassed so far , but we need you to help us prove it . ♪ - I 'd like to talk to you , alone . You 'd be dead if I hadn 't called him in to save you . After you . So , we spiked our gluhwein with vodka . - Gluhwein and intrigue , nice ! - Mm-hmm . And , um , Felix and I actually got some serious après-ski cred by the end of it , but Delphine was , like , all business . What was S even doing with her out there ? - I don 't know . I mean , I only met her the once . - So who else was she meeting ? I have no idea . And we don 't have time for this . We gotta get ready . Westmorland wants unprecedented access to human genetics , and Hashem Al-Khatib was bribing governments worldwide to get it . But you don 't have record of any of that , do you ? No , but Neolution want to sell curated , commercialized evolution to the one percent who can afford it . So they can live forever , grow a bloody tail if they want to . The rest of us are Coady 's department , targeted for sterilization . How 's that sitting with you these days ? You saved my granddaughter . I 'm willing to take a gamble on nature over nurture . This is all the supporting evidence to our claims . Without proof of bribes , it would barely carry a news cycle . You 're a smart woman , Rachel . Like any good CEO , you kept a shadow file , a record of where the bodies are buried . Give me the proof I need to back this up . Give yourself a chance to be truly free . - Let Cosima make an appearance . - No . - Yes ! - I 'm not gonna do that . What I need is for you to leave right now before people start arriving and something " cloney " happens . - Alison , I 'm already on ... - Look around you . It 's already happening . Right ? - Well ... - Shit . - Colin . - Hello , Felix . Hello . Oof ! I 've come early . And often . I remember . Hmmm . - Oh , this is my , uh ... foster sister , Sarah . You , uh ... you 're Colin then ? Cool ! Very cool ! - You alright ? - Yes , I-I remember the time I ID 'd your dead body . Yes , but we got over that , didn 't we , Colin ? - Did we ? - Yes . - I think we did . - My God , it 's so white in here ! Hello ! Bar 's to the left . Enjoy yourselves . Have a nip around , yeah ? Hey , mind you , I want you to meet someone . Congratulations . Both of you . That book is about your life ? Yes . It 's for my babies . It 's my ... joys and my pain and sorrows , so they walk a brighter path . Sestra Irina is going to town , so we have to take care of toilet . - " Toilet " ? - Cleaning . Come when you are done .

The entire time that we were gone , he was painting you , different versions of you . But you don 't seem to care . And Delphine , I don 't know .

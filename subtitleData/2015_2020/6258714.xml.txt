 THIS IS RIDICULOUS . YOU CAN 'T HOLD ME ON THIS SHIP ! I RECOGNIZE AND RESPECT YOUR POSITION , SIR , BUT I AM UNDER ORDERS . THIS IS AN OUTRAGE . WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME ? SIR , PLEASE , THIS WILL BE A LOT EASIER IF YOU DON 'T RESIST . DON 'T RESIST ? I 'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , AND THIS IS TREASON ! DID HE SAY " PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES " ? Rachel : WHERE IS NIELS ? RECOVERING IN THE MEDICAL BAY . HE 'LL BE IN A MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS . HOW DID HE GET TO AMERICA ? HOW DID HE FIND HIS WAY TO THE IMMUNES ? DON 'T KNOW YET . THAT 'S SOMETHING I 'LL ASK THE PRESIDENT . WHO YOU BELIEVE IS ONE OF THEM ? HE SEEMS TO THINK SO . WE 'RE GONNA TRY AND CHANGE THAT . Senator : THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT IS A RELIC FROM ANOTHER TIME , AND THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE ... FOOTAGE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE FILES . ... AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NO LONGER NEED HAVE A ROLE - - MY APOLOGIES FOR INTERRUPTING YOU , MR. SENATOR . BUT SINCE I ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE GOING TO SAY , LET ME JUST CUT TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER . IT IS A SADLY MISUNDERSTOOD IDEA THAT WE HAVE SOMEHOW GRADUATED FROM OUR OBLIGATIONS OF DEVELOPING THIS COUNTRY 'S INFRASTRUCTURE . WE ARE 27th IN HOMELESSNESS , 36th IN PEOPLE LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE ... HE 'S GOT STRENGTH . 19th IN URBAN TECHNOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION . NOW , I , FOR ONE , AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT . ARE YOU ? Reporter : WITH FLORIDA REPORTING THE FIRST CASES ... HOW MUCH DOES THE CREW KNOW ? THEY KNOW WE 'VE GOT THE PRESIDENT . SOME OF THEM KNOW HE DIDN 'T QUITE COME WILLINGLY . AND THAT HE WAS WITH THE IMMUNES ? NO . WE 'LL HAVE TO TURN HIM QUICKLY TO AVOID THAT QUESTION . YEAH , WELL , IN MY MIND , IF HE DOESN 'T WALK OUT OF THAT ROOM COMMITTED TO OUR CAUSE BY SUNRISE TOMORROW , WE 'LL NEVER CONVINCE OUR CREW HE 'S WORTHY OF BEING FOLLOWED . THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST THE CREW . THE COUNTRY NEEDS A LEADER . YEAH . AND IF THE FIRST 200 PEOPLE WHO COME IN CONTACT WITH HIM THINK HE 'S TAINTED , IT 'S NOT GONNA WORK . WE DON 'T FEEL THERE 'S A NEED FOR PANIC RIGHT NOW . Burk : HE DOESN 'T WANT TO EAT , SIR . WELL ... WRAP THIS UP FOR LATER . WHY DON 'T YOU HAVE GREEN RELIEVE YOU ? GO GET YOURSELF CLEANED UP . AYE , SIR . [ DOOR OPENS ] COMMANDER MIKE SLATTERY . I 'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THIS SHIP . I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE CAPTAIN . WELL , HE 'S PRESENTLY INDISPOSED - - WANTED US TO GET ACQUAINTED TILL HE GETS HERE . YOU ARE AWARE THAT KIDNAPPING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE , PUNISHABLE BY DEATH ? THE CAPTAIN WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION HE WAS RESCUING YOU . AT GUNPOINT , AGAINST MY WILL ? [ CHUCKLES ] SIR , I DON 'T THINK YOU REALIZE WHO THE RAMSEYS ARE OR WHAT THEIR GOAL IS - - YOU DON 'T NEED TO TELL ME ANYTHING . NO , SIR , I DON 'T . UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE FULLY INFORMED . I 'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING , IF I MAY . THIS IS FROM AUGUST . SHE WAS SECOND IN SUCCESSION - - PRESIDENT THEN . THESE WERE HER ORDERS TO US . President Geller : MORNING , COMMANDER . I KNOW - - THE LAST YOU HEARD , I WAS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE . THE PRESIDENT DIED TWO MONTHS AGO , THE VICE PRESIDENT A WEEK LATER . WHAT 'S LEFT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS HOLED UP 200 FEET BELOW THE WHITE HOUSE . CAN YOU GET ANY TIGHTER ON HIS FACE ? I 'LL TRY TO ZOOM IN , SIR . MOST OF OUR POPULATION , ALONG WITH OUR ARMED FORCES , IS DYING OR DEAD . WE HAVE NO ALLIES , WE HAVE NO ENEMIES - - JUST A WORLD OF SICK , DESPERATE PEOPLE . IF DR. SCOTT HAS THE MAKINGS OF A CURE , YOU MUST COME HOME - - NOW . WE CAME HOME . FOUND THINGS NOT QUITE AS HOSPITABLE AS WE 'D HOPED . NO INFRASTRUCTURE ... NO GOVERNMENT , NO ORDERS . SO WE WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE , AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET OUR HANDS ON MANY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL FILES AND DIRECTIVES . THIS IS THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY . I UNDERSTAND YOU - - YOU KNEW HIM PRETTY WELL . THE U.S. NAVY IS CURRENTLY ON A MISSION TO FIND THE MATERIALS FOR A VACCINE TO COMBAT THE PANDEMIC . IF YOU 'RE VIEWING THIS VIDEO , YOU ARE PART OF THE NEW NETWORK OF FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES , WHICH WERE CHOSEN TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE . YOU 'LL BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CIVILIAN COMMAND WITH EACH OTHER . HOPEFULLY , YOU 'LL THEN START PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE VACCINE , AND WE CAN GET TO THE TASK OF REBUILDING OUR GREAT NATION . GODSPEED . [ CLICK ] WE HAVE THE CURE , SIR . DR. SCOTT WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE IT RIGHT HERE ON THIS SHIP . GUESS YOU WOULDN 'T HAVE ANY NEED FOR IT YOURSELF . THE REST OF THE WORLD , THE ONES WHO AREN 'T LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE NATURALLY IMMUNE ... WE GOT TO NORFOLK , WE FOUND PILOTS , WE SENT DOSES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND TO EUROPE , AS WE WERE ORDERED TO DO . THE PROJECT TO MASS-PRODUCE THE CURE WAS WELL UNDER WAY , AND THEN WE RAN INTO SOME PROBLEMS . THIS IS A RECORDING MADE BY ONE OF OUR SCIENTISTS . HE WAS TRYING TO GET A MESSAGE THROUGH TO DR. SCOTT . RACHEL . OH , GOD , I PRAY THIS GETS TO YOU . LISTEN , W-W-WE 'RE UNDER ATTACK , RACHEL . BUT IT 'S IMPORTANT - - IT 'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU LEARN THIS . I 'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DATA YOU SENT ME ABOUT THE CURE , AND I THINK I 'VE FOUND A WAY TO HELP . [ GUNFIRE ] I 'M SENDING YOU THE DATA NOW . [ GUNFIRE CONTINUES ] I DIDN 'T - - OH , GOD . OH , GOD . LISTEN , IT 'S ALL WORKED OUT . ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS - - I JUST SOMEHOW PRAY THAT THIS FILE GETS TO YOU , RACHEL - - [ MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] [ CRASH ] MacDowell : COME ON , NOW . TAKE IT ALL ! WE NEED TO FIND THAT SERVER . OKAY , DOC . STAND UP . NO , PLEASE . PLEASE . [ TWO GUNSHOTS ] YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT IRISH ACCENT . THOSE WERE SEAN RAMSEY 'S PEOPLE . THEY GAINED ACCESS TO OUR SECRET NETWORK , THE LOCATION OF ALL OUR LABS , AND THEY BLEW THEM UP WITH THEIR LONG-RANGE MISSILES . DESTROYED OUR LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE , MURDERED OUR SCIENTISTS - - ALL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE THE INHERITORS OF THE EARTH . THAT 'S WHY CAPTAIN CHANDLER RESCUED YOU FROM THE RAMSEYS . I CAN ONLY ASSUME YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS . I MEAN , IF YOU DID ... THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT DR. SCOTT 'S PROTOCOLS , EXPERIMENTS , AND TRIALS . COMPLETE CAPTAIN 'S LOGS , COMBAT CENTER RECORDS , INCLUDING OUR ATTEMPT AT A RESPONSE TO THE RAMSEYS ' ASSAULT ON OUR LABS . IT 'S NOT EASY TO LISTEN TO , BUT I THINK IT 'LL BE INFORMATIVE . I 'LL LET THE CAPTAIN KNOW THAT YOU 'VE BEEN BRIEFED . [ DOOR OPENS ] LEAVING HIM WITHOUT A GUARD ? WE NEED TO SEE WHAT HE DOES WHEN HE 'S ALONE . HEY . WELL DONE , DETECTIVE . WHAT 'S HE DOING ? PACING , BITING HIS FINGERNAILS . HE 'S EYEING THE LAPTOP . GOT TO BE CURIOUS AFTER WHAT I JUST DUMPED ON HIM . HERE HE GOES . WHAT THE HELL IS HE - - WHAT IS THAT ? NOBODY FRISKED HIM ? HE WAS UNARMED . CAN WE GET A BETTER LOOK AT THE MONITOR ? Alisha : I 'LL CHANGE ANGLES , SIR . CAN YOU ZOOM ? Sean : IT ISN 'T A QUESTION OF WHAT WE 'VE LOST , IT 'S A QUESTION OF WHAT WE 'VE BEEN GIVEN ... THAT 'S RAMSEY . AND THAT IS A CHANCE - - A CHANCE TO START AGAIN . A CHANCE TO RENEW THE HUMAN SPIRIT WITH OUR VALIANCE , A CHANCE TO RECLAIM THE WORLD . THIS IS OUR CALLING , AND IF YOU ARE WATCHING THIS , KNOW THAT WE ARE CALLING YOU . [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] Sean : AND YOU MUST PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE TASK AHEAD . THERE WILL BE DOUBTERS ... WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE IS ON THAT DRIVE . WE WALK IN THERE AND ASK HIM FOR IT , HE 'LL KNOW WE 'VE BEEN SURVEILLING HIM . HE 'LL CLAM UP COMPLETELY . WHEN YOU 'RE TRYING TO BREAK AN AL-QAEDA OPERATIVE , YOU DON 'T LET HIM KEEP MESSAGES FROM BIN LADEN IN HIS POCKET . WE TAKE AWAY THE COMPUTER . WE PREVENT HIM FROM ACCESSING THE MESSAGES . LOOK AT THAT MAN . HE 'S A LOST CAUSE . WE DON 'T KNOW THAT , SIR - - NOT YET . RIGHT , AND WHILE WE 'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT , WE 'RE SITTING HERE BURNING FUEL , HIDING BEHIND THIS ISLAND , WONDERING WHAT THE SUB IS UP TO , WHAT ITS PLANS ARE . WE HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW THEY COMMUNICATE . WE HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW RAMSEY SENT THOSE MESSAGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALL THE WAY FROM EUROPE . I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU 'RE TRYING TO DO , SIR , BUT GETTING INTEL OUT OF THIS MAN HAS TO BE PRIORITY NUMBER ONE . BUT YOU , JEFFREY , YOU WERE PUT ON THE EARTH FOR THIS , [ DOOR OPENS ] TO FIGHT THE FORCES OF - - [ BEEP ] COFFEE ? I 'M JUST FINE . THANKS . YOU WANTED TO TALK . SENDING YOUR X.O. IN HERE FIRST - - THAT SOME KIND OF GAME ? I WAS IN THE COMBAT CENTER , MONITORING SEAN RAMSEY 'S SUB . WELL , I IMAGINE THEY 'LL BE COMING FROM ME . THEN WHAT - - THEY 'RE GONNA BLOW US OUT OF THE WATER IF WE DON 'T RELEASE YOU ? SOMETHING LIKE THAT . SO , THEY 'RE IN THE HABIT OF USING THEIR MISSILES ? YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LABS . THE LABS , OUR SCIENTISTS - - YOUR X.O. TRIED TO SELL ME ON THAT . YOU THINK WE MANUFACTURED THAT VIDEO ? YOU WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO BRING ME ON THIS SHIP . DOCTORING A VIDEO WOULD NOT BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT . ACCORDING TO SEAN , YOU 'RE THE CHOSEN , RIGHT ? I WOULD THINK A SHIP CARRYING THE CURE , LABS TRYING TO MANUFACTURE THAT CURE , WELL THAT WOULD BE THE GREATEST THREAT POSSIBLE TO HIM . WE ARE STRONG BECAUSE OF OUR STRENGTH . WE DON 'T NEED TO DESTROY ANYONE ELSE . SO , YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE THE CURE ? I BELIEVE YOU THINK YOU DO . AND YOU 'VE SEEN OUR INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT , THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY ? I 'VE SEEN THEM . THEY 'RE FROM MONTHS AGO . THEY 'RE OBSOLETE . WELL , THAT LEAVES ME IN A BIT OF A BIND . WE HAVE STANDING ORDERS FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION - - ORDERS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL PROTOCOLS - - AND THEN WE HAVE YOU , THE NEW PRESIDENT , ISSUING ORDERS THAT DON 'T SEEM TO BE IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST AT ALL . THE NATIONAL INTEREST IS SAVING WHAT 'S LEFT OF THIS COUNTRY . SEAN RAMSEY AND OUR MOVEMENT GIVE THE COUNTRY THE BEST CHANCE AT THAT . CONVINCE ME . TELL ME HOW IT ALL HAPPENED - - HOW YOU CAME TO THIS POINT , WHY YOU 'RE SO SURE OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE . IS HE TRYING TO TURN HIM OR GET THE INTEL ? COME ON , MR. PRESIDENT . YOU WANT OFF THIS SHIP , YOU 'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONVINCE ME . THE OUTBREAK HAD JUST STARTED IN EARNEST , IN THE SOUTH . 'COURSE , THAT WAS BEFORE ANYONE KNEW HOW BAD IT WOULD BECOME . THE PRESIDENT SENT ME DOWN TO TALLAHASSEE TO CREATE QUARANTINE AREAS AND ORGANIZE SAFE ZONES . IT WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE FOR A WEEK OR SO , BUT THEN ... THINGS STARTED SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL VERY QUICKLY . IT WAS UNTENABLE FOR ME TO LEAVE THE REGION . WITHIN A MONTH , THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS ENVELOPED . I CAN 'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE . NO . YOU CAN 'T . AND YOUR FAMILY ? THEY WERE WITH ME . BUT NOT IMMUNE ? SAFE ZONES WERE CREATED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE . BUT THERE WASN 'T A RELIABLE TEST FOR THE VIRUS , AND EARLY SYMPTOMS WERE VERY SUBTLE . WE COULDN 'T STOP IT . AND HOW DID YOU DISCOVER THAT YOU WERE IMMUNE ? WE WERE IN ONE OF THE SAFE ZONES I CREATED - - DOAK STADIUM , WHERE THE SEMINOLES USED TO PLAY ? SURE . WELL , WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU SEE 20,000 PEOPLE DEAD AND ONLY A HANDFUL ALIVE , YOU START TO GET THE FEELING THAT MAYBE YOU 'RE SPECIAL , EXCEPT NOT IN ANY WAY YOU 'D WANT TO BE - - NOT WHEN YOUR CHILDREN ARE BLEEDING OUT OF THEIR EYEBALLS . AND SEAN ? HOW DID YOU FIND YOUR WAY TO HIM ? I ONLY WANTED TO DIE . FOR THREE WEEKS , I WALKED AROUND EXPOSING MYSELF TO ANYONE WHO WAS SICK . I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT STRAIN , MAYBE THERE WAS SOME OTHER WAY THAT I COULD CATCH IT . ONE DAY , I STUMBLED UPON A GROUP OF SURVIVORS . EXCEPT THEY WEREN 'T ACTING LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE . THEY DIDN 'T HAVE THAT RABID LOOK IN THEIR EYES - - THE DESPERATION , THE LOSS . THEY HAD A SENSE OF PURPOSE , UNITY - - HOPE , EVEN . AND I LEARNED THEY WERE ALL IMMUNE AND THAT I WAS ONE OF THEM . AND I SLEPT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS . I HELD FOOD DOWN , AND I STARTED TO SEE THAT THERE 'S MORE THAN LOSS AND DESPERATION - - THAT THERE 'S A FUTURE , A WAY TO START AGAIN . THEY SHOWED ME HOW THE MOVEMENT BEGAN IN EUROPE - - THAT FROM THE ASHES , THEY WERE ONCE AGAIN BUILDING A CIVILIZATION . AND I REALIZED , IF I 'M THE SURVIVING MEMBER OF THE CABINET , IF I 'M THE PRESIDENT , I CAN BE A PART OF MAKING IT HAPPEN HERE . BECAUSE ONE THING WAS CLEAR - - SEAN RAMSEY MAY NOT BE WHAT WE ASKED FOR , BUT HE WAS WHAT WAS GIVEN TO US , AND HIS VISION IS WHAT 'S SAVING THE WORLD . AND WHAT EXACTLY IS HIS VISION ? IMMUNES REMAIN TOGETHER , UNITED . CREATE A NEW LINE OF THE HUMAN RACE , STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND ANY PLAGUE . A MASTER RACE ? YEAH , WELL , THAT 'S A PRETTY ANTIQUATED VIEW OF IT . THAT 'S WHAT IT IS . I KNOW IT SOUNDS CUTTHROAT , BUT THERE 'S A DEEP LOGIC TO IT . AND THAT IS ... ? NON-IMMUNES WILL EVENTUALLY BRING DOWN THE REST OF YOU IF YOU CO-MINGLE , IF YOU PROCREATE ? HOW MANY OF YOU ARE EVEN LEFT ON THIS PLANET ? HOW SPREAD OUT ARE YOU ? WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES - - THE PEOPLE STRONG ENOUGH TO SURVIVE . THAT 'S DARWIN . THAT 'S THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE . THAT 'S BIBLICAL . SOME PEOPLE AROUND HERE FEEL THAT THIS IS THE ARK . BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE CURE ? HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL LAST BEFORE THE VIRUS MUTATES AGAIN ? THE VIRUS IS STABILIZED . WHO DO YOU THINK YOU 'RE TALKING TO ? I HAD ACCESS TO THE TOP GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS . I SAW THE VIRUS MUTATE FIVE , SIX TIMES A MONTH . THAT WAS AUGUST . IT 'S STABILIZED NOW . SAYS WHO ? SAYS OUR SCIENTIST . DR. SCOTT ? MOST PEOPLE THINK SHE 'S A QUACK . SHE IS NOT A QUACK . WELL ... SEAN 'S SCIENTISTS SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT . I 'M NOT SURE WHY I SHOULD BELIEVE YOURS . EVEN IF THEY 'RE RIGHT ... WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU WON 'T FALL PREY TO THE NEXT STRAND ? OR THE NEXT POLIO OR SMALLPOX OR SWINE FLU ? BECAUSE THEY 'VE TESTED OUR BLOOD . WE HAVE CERTAIN ANTIBODIES , PROTEINS , COAGULATES THAT MAKE US - - WHAT ? INVINCIBLE ? BEST EQUIPPED TO CARRY THE TORCH FOR HUMANITY . IT 'S A RESPONSIBILITY , AND WE DON 'T TAKE IT LIGHTLY . RESPONSIBILITY ? THAT 'S RIGHT - - RESPONSIBILITY . THIS IS GOING OFF THE RAILS . I DON 'T KNOW , SIR . AND IF I WERE TO LET YOU GO , SEND YOU BACK TO THE RAMSEYS , WHAT WOULD YOUR GAME PLAN BE THEN ? YOU ALREADY HEARD - - I 'M GOING TO NEW ORLEANS . I DID HEAR THAT . WHAT I DON 'T KNOW IS WHY . OKAY , OKAY . AFTER KATRINA , THE GOVERNMENT SWORE WE 'D NEVER LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN . IT HAS THE LARGEST PUMPING STATION ON THE PLANET , PLUS A 2-MILE WALL THAT CAN SEAL OFF THE CHANNEL , PLUS HUGE STORES OF FOOD , MEDICINE , AN INDEPENDENT HYDROELECTRIC GRID , LOTS OF BOATS . IT 'S BEST PLACE TO START REBUILDING THE COUNTRY . AND THE PEOPLE SURVIVING THERE , THE ONES WHO AREN 'T IMMUNE - - WHAT WILL THE RAMSEYS DO WITH THEM ? " DO WITH THEM " ? I HAVE TO IMAGINE IT 'S PRETTY HARD TO START A MASTER RACE OF NATURALLY IMMUNE DEMIGODS WITH ALL THOSE PESKY NON-IMMUNE SURVIVORS HANGING AROUND . WE 'LL CREATE OUR OWN SOCIETIES . YOURS WILL DIE OUT ON THEIR OWN . THAT WHAT HE SAID ? THAT 'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN . SO NO KILLING ? NO - - NO KILLING , DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK YOU HEARD ON THAT TAPE . HOW DO YOU KNOW SEAN WON 'T GO TO NEW ORLEANS WITHOUT YOU ? HE WOULDN 'T . HOW DO YOU KNOW ? YOU JUST MET THE GUY THREE DAYS AGO . BECAUSE WE 'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS FOR MONTHS . HE CAME TO AMERICA FOR ME . FOR MONTHS ? HOW ? HOW 'D YOU COMMUNICATE ? YOU DON 'T REALLY THINK I 'M GONNA TELL YOU THAT ? I 'M NOT AGAINST YOU , MR. PRESIDENT . I 'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW ALL OF THIS EVOLVED . AMERICAN IMMUNES NEED AN AMERICAN TO LEAD THEM . THAT 'S HOW . THAT 'S WHAT HE TELLS YOU , ISN 'T IT ? THAT 'S RIGHT . IT 'S TRUE . WELL , THEN , MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME WHY OUR SONAR OPERATORS ARE PICKING UP RAMSEY 'S SUB HEADING WEST - - TO NEW ORLEANS - - AS WE SPEAK . THAT 'S NOT - - WHEN SEAN KNOWS WE 'RE HIDING BEHIND THIS ISLAND . THAT 'S IMPOSSIBLE . WHY IS THAT IMPOSSIBLE , MR. PRESIDENT ? GREAT BLUFF . THAT 'S NOT WHAT I SAID . I THINK IT WAS . WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE ? YOU THINK YOU CAN MANIPULATE ME . I 'M JUST TRYING TO TALK TO YOU , SIR . I 'M SURE EVEN PRISONERS ON THIS SHIP HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR OWN QUARTERS . YOU 'RE NOT A PRISONER . WELL ... THEN I CAN GO NOW ? THAT SUB 'S GOT TO BE WOUNDED FROM ITS DIVE DOWN INTO THE CANYON DURING OUR ASSAULT . THAT 'S WHY MICHENER SAID IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE THEY WERE ON THE MOVE . THEY MUST BE SITTING OFF THE COAST OF JACKSONVILLE TRYING TO REPAIR IT , WHICH IS WHY THEY HAVEN 'T BEEN CHASING US ALL THIS TIME . SO , WHAT DO WE FIGURE , FROM A DIVE LIKE THAT ? COULD BE HULL DAMAGE , SOUND MATTING , PROPELLERS . MAYBE IT 'S BEYOND REPAIR . MAYBE THEY 'LL BE PARKED THERE FOR GOOD . WELL , IF THEY CAN 'T MANEUVER - - WE DON 'T KNOW THAT , AND WE CAN 'T COUNT ON IT . WE PUSH THEM , FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEIR DAMAGE IS . THEY 'LL BE PREPARED NOW . AS LIKELY TO GIVE ME BULLSHIT AS THE TRUTH . SO WE STAY HERE BEHIND THE ISLAND OR WE POKE OUR BEAKS OUT ? BRING US OUT AT QUIET ONE - - SOUTH-SOUTHEAST , AT LEAST 20 MILES BETWEEN US AND THE COAST . AYE-AYE . HELM , STEADY COURSE 1-7-0 . ALL ENGINES , HEAD 2 / 3 AND 12 KNOTS . I TOOK A CRUISE BY THE MESS DECKS . PRETTY HOT TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WHY THE PRESIDENT HASN 'T MADE AN APPEARANCE . I SAID HE WAS BEING BRIEFED . THAT STORY WON 'T HOLD AFTER MORNING . AGREED , SIR . I THINK I BLEW IT . TRAPPING HIM LIKE THAT . GOT THE INTEL . MIGHT 'VE LOST THE MAN . THE RAMSEYS OFFERED A NARRATIVE THAT MADE HIS TRAGEDY SOMETHING HE COULD LIVE WITH . YOU 'VE GOT TO GAIN HIS TRUST , SIR . THEN YOU 'LL NEED A NEW NARRATIVE THAT 'S STRONGER THAN THEIRS . I WASN 'T TRYING TO MANIPULATE YOU , BUT I DID NEED TO KNOW WHERE THAT SUB WAS . NOW I KNOW IT 'S DAMAGED AND SITTING ON THE COAST . WHICH MEANS WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE . WE 'LL BE HEADED TO NEW ORLEANS OURSELVES , AND WE 'RE GONNA GET THERE AHEAD OF YOUR FRIENDS . WE 'LL LIE IN WAIT FOR THEM THERE , AND WE WILL TAKE THEM OUT . [ INHALES DEEPLY ] YOU SHOULD KNOW , SIR I 'VE GIVEN EVERYTHING FOR MY COUNTRY TO SERVE A MISSION I DIDN 'T ASK FOR . AND I 'D BE SITTING SAFELY IN A CABIN IN THE WOODS IN VIRGINIA WITH MY FAMILY RIGHT NOW IF I HADN 'T STAYED WITH THIS SHIP . INSTEAD I LOST MY WIFE TO THE VIRUS . DIDN 'T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO HOLD HER HAND ... OR SAY GOODBYE . MY CHILDREN DID . THEY WATCHED HER DIE WONDERING WHERE I WAS . I FOUND THEM IN AN EXTERMINATION CAMP - - IN A STADIUM , LIKE THE ONE YOU WERE IN . HAD I SHOWN UP AN HOUR LATER , THEY 'D BE DEAD . AN HOUR EARLIER , I MIGHT 'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE MY WIFE . NOW THEY 'RE HOLED UP IN A GHOST TOWN WITH MY FATHER - - 68 YEARS OLD ... A HEART CONDITION . IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM AND I 'M OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN ... I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU 'D BE LOOKING FOR MEANING WANTING ALL OF THIS TO SOMEHOW BE FATE ... OR DESTINY ... FOR IT ALL NOT TO JUST BE ... TERRIBLE , TRAGIC AND RANDOM . [ SIGHS ] I DO UNDERSTAND . I HELD MY SON 'S HAND . WATCHED HIM SLIP AWAY . HIS BREATH SO LABORED AT THE END ... THE WHEEZING , HIS LUNGS ... HE WAS IN AGONY . I THOUGHT THERE COULD BE NOTHING WORSE . AND THEN ... MY DAUGHTERS ... MY WIFE ... KNOWING WHAT WAS COMING ... THAT WAS THE MOST UNBEARABLE THING OF ALL . AND HE WOULDN 'T EVEN HAVE BEEN THERE IF I ... IF WHAT ? IF WHAT , SIR ? [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ DOOR OPENS ] VERY SORRY TO DISTURB YOU , SIR , BUT THERE 'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO HEAR . IT 'S A LOOPING MESSAGE ON A MAJOR FM FREQUENCY . [ STATIC ] Woman : ATTENTION , CITIZENS OF AMERICA . THIS IS A MESSAGE FOR YOU FROM THE UNDERGROUND . THE U.S. NAVAL SHIP NATHAN JAMES HAS BEEN TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST , CLAIMING TO HAVE A CURE FOR THE RED FLU . NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY 'RE GIVING PEOPLE . SOME BELIEVE IT 'S A NEW STRAIN OF THE VIRUS . OTHERS BELIEVE IT 'S AN EXPERIMENT WITH AN UNPROVEN VACCINE . BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR - - IT DOESN 'T WORK AND IT IS NOT A CURE . WE HAVE ALL SUSPECTED FOR A LONG TIME ... GOT TO BE THE RAMSEYS . CAN YOU TRACE THE SOURCE ? NO , SIR . WE 'RE RECEIVING THE BROADCAST FROM MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS . SHOULD YOU COME IN CONTACT WITH THIS SHIP , STAY AWAY OR FIGHT THEM . WE ARE TIRED OF BEING LIED TO . [ PANTING ] Michener : HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN ? WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE ! Son : [ Weakly ] SORRY , DAD . [ Voice breaking ] I 'M SO SORRY . [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ SNIFFLES ] [ GASPS ] Daughter : DADDY ? ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? ! [ FISTS BANG , ECHOES ] [ SOBS ] [ MUFFLED SCREAMING ] [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN IN THERE ? I DON 'T KNOW - - FEW MINUTES . [ KNOCKS ] MR. PRESIDENT ? SAID HE HAD TO TAKE A LEAK . [ KNOCKS ] MR. PRESIDENT ? OR MAYBE HE 'S DOING THE OTHER THING . HE 'S THE PRESIDENT . WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ? [ KNOCKS ] MR. PRESIDENT , OPEN UP NOW ! JESUS CHRIST ! GET DOC RIOS ! NOW ! [ HURRIED FOOTSTEPS ] GOD DAMN IT ! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ? ! [ MONITOR BEEPING ] Slattery : YOU CAN 'T STILL THINK YOU 'RE GONNA REHABILITATE HIM ? NOBODY BESIDES THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM KNOW THIS HAPPENED . THAT 'S WHY I HAD HIM BROUGHT DOWN HERE . SO YOU 'RE GONNA HIDE IT FORM THE CREW ? WE MADE THAT MISTAKE ONCE BEFORE , AND IT ALMOST BIT US IN THE ASS . DID YOU NOT HEAR THOSE BROADCASTS ? THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , THE PEOPLE WE 'RE HERE TO HELP , ARE NOT GONNA BUY WHAT WE ARE SELLING . UNLESS WE HAVE THIS GUY ? HE 'S GONNA SAVE THE DAY ? HE 'S THE PRESIDENT . THAT 'S STILL GONNA MEAN SOMETHING TO PEOPLE . HE 'S A SOLDIER . HE WANTS SOMEONE TO SALUTE TO . [ GRUNTS ] THAT WASN 'T A VERY SMART THING YOU DID . [ SIGHS ] BUT , THEN , I GUESS YOU 'VE BEEN TRYING TO ERASE YOURSELF FOR A LONG TIME - - EVER SINCE THE FOOTBALL STADIUM . THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU SAID ABOUT THAT . YOU SAID YOU WALKED AROUND TRYING TO GET INFECTED - - TO GIVE YOURSELF THE DISEASE . I 'VE BEEN WONDERING - - IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO KILL YOURSELF , WHY NOT PUT A BULLET IN YOUR BRAIN OR JUMP OFF A BUILDING ? WHY DID YOU WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF THE MOST PAINFUL DEATH IMAGINABLE IF YOU 'D JUST WATCHED YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY AND 20,000 PEOPLE DIE ? STOP IT . JUST STOP IT . WILL YOU STOP IT ALREADY ? JUST LEAVE ME ALONE . WHAT AM I EVEN DOING ON THIS SHIP ? WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT FROM ME ? ! [ CLANK ] YOU BLAME YOURSELF . YOU THINK YOU COULD 'VE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY . SOMEHOW , ALL THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE ALIVE - - YOUR WIFE , YOUR DAUGHTERS ? WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY , JEFF ? NOTHING . NOTHING . WE 'RE GOING TO NEW ORLEANS . AND YOU 'RE GOING TO HELP US DEFEAT WHOEVER IT IS THAT TWISTED YOU ALL AROUND , BUT WE ARE NEVER GONNA GET THERE UNTIL YOU FACE WHATEVER IT IS YOU CAN 'T LET GO OF . THERE 'S NOTHING - - NOTHING TO LET GO OF ! IT WAS YOUR SON , WASN 'T IT ? HE WAS IN MICHIGAN . SUMMER SESSION AT THE UNIVERSITY . YOU HAD HIM BROUGHT DOWN TO FLORIDA . NO . AGAINST CDC PROTOCOLS . NO . THERE WAS NO WAY TO TEST HIM , BUT HE SEEMED OKAY , AND YOU LET HIM IN THE STADIUM . THAT 'S NOT - - THAT 'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED ! I HAVE THE RECORDS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE . NO , YOU 'RE WRONG ! TWO DAYS AFTER YOU BROUGHT HIM TO FLORIDA , THERE WAS A MASSIVE OUTBREAK IN ANN ARBOR . NO , PLEASE ! PLEASE ! THAT 'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED ! THE SECURITY DETAILS - - THEY WERE LAX ! YOU COULDN 'T HAVE KNOWN . HE INFECTED EVERYONE IN THAT STADIUM - - IT WAS HOT ! THEY WERE CARELESS WITH THEIR MASKS ! YOUR WIFE , YOUR DAUGHTERS . PLEASE ! NO ! NO ! IT WAS ALL ON YOU . THAT 'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED ! STOP IT ! YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT EVERYBODY . STOP IT . AND THEN YOU STUMBLED INTO THE IMMUNES , AND THEY TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS ALL MEANT TO BE AND THAT YOU WERE CHOSEN AND YOUR CHILDREN WERE NOT AND THAT ALL OF THIS WAS DESTINY . AND IT WAS EASY FOR YOU TO BELIEVE BECAUSE YOU NEEDED TO BELIEVE IT - - BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GO ON . THERE 'S ANOTHER WAY NOW . WITH US . I KILLED MY DAUGHTERS . I KNOW . NO . NO . YOU DON 'T . THEN TELL ME . IT 'S JUST YOU AND ME - - NOBODY ELSE . TELL ME . AFTER MY SON DIED ... AND MY DAUGHTERS STARTED GETTING THE SYMPTOMS ... MY WIFE ... SHE BEGGED ME TO PUT THEM OUT OF THEIR MISERY B-B-BEFORE IT BECAME ... AND I DID IT . [ Voice breaking ] WITH MY OWN BARE HANDS . I SMOTHERED THEM IN THEIR SLEEP . BUT HOLLIE ... SHE WOKE UP . A-AND SHE STRUGGLED . AND THAT 'S THE LAST THING SHE EVER FELT - - WAS HER FATHER BETRAYING HER . [ SNIFFLES ] SO ... WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT ? HMM ? HOW DO I LIVE WITH THAT ? I 'VE KILLED PEOPLE . MORE THAN I CAN COUNT NOW . SOME OF THEM WERE FIRMLY ALIGNED AGAINST US WITH THE WORST OF INTENTIONS . SOME OF THEM WERE JUST CAUGHT UP IN THE MADNESS THAT ALL THIS HAS CREATED AND SIMPLY TRYING TO SURVIVE . WE 'VE ALL DONE THINGS ... THAT ARE HARD TO LIVE WITH . [ SNIFFLES ] SO LET THIS BE YOUR REDEMPTION , IF IT NEEDS TO BE , BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE MINE . THE PROBLEM WITH THE SUB IS THE SOUND MATTING . LAST I HEARD , THE DIVERS WERE TRYING TO FIX IT , BUT I DON 'T KNOW HOW MUCH PROGRESS THEY 'RE MAKING . IN ALL LIKELIHOOD , WE 'LL BE IN NEW ORLEANS WAY AHEAD OF THEM . AND THE IMMUNES ' INFRASTRUCTURE , HOW ORGANIZED ARE THEY ? HOW MANY YOU THINK THERE ARE IN AMERICA ? OH , THOUSANDS . TENS OF THOUSANDS - - MAYBE MORE . Garnett : AND THEIR PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AGAINST US - - HOW FAR HAS THAT GOTTEN ? AS FAR AS I KNOW , THE HAM RADIO BROADCAST YOU PLAYED ME WAS THE BEGINNING . I THINK IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO YOUR TAKING ME . WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT HOW THEY COMMUNICATE ? I KNOW THEY WERE WORKING ON A NETWORK - - SOME WAY OF CONNECTING WITH OTHER CHAPTERS - - BUT I HADN 'T HEARD THE DETAILS AND I 'M NOT SURE HOW IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED , AND I DON 'T KNOW HOW THEY WERE GETTING SEAN 'S MESSAGES THROUGH FROM EUROPE . I ASSUMED THAT THE MISSIONARIES WERE FLYING THEM OVER . UH ... WE 'RE GONNA NEED TO SEE THAT FLASH DRIVE , MR. PRESIDENT . OH . SORRY . HERE YOU GO . RAMSEY 'S MEN WERE ... [ ZIPPER OPENS ] ... HANDING THESE OUT ... TO THE NON-IMMUNES . THERE 'S A MECHANISM INSIDE THAT RELEASES THE VIRUS TO INFECT PEOPLE . THEY WERE GIVING ... TO CHILDREN ? MM. Chandler : WE CAPTURED ONE OF THEIR SCIENTISTS - - NIELS SORENSEN . BUT WHAT WE DON 'T KNOW IS IF ANYONE ELSE IN THEIR CAMP IS TRAINED TO REPLICATE THIS IDEA . IF YOU SAW ANYTHING OR HEARD ANYTHING ... ? NO , I 'M SORRY . I HAVE NO IDEA . I WISH THAT I COULD HELP . I THINK WE 'VE GOT ENOUGH FOR NOW . WELCOME , MR. PRESIDENT . MR. PRESIDENT . MR. PRESIDENT . [ ZIPPER CLOSES ] [ DOOR OPENS ] [ SIGHS ] TO CHILDREN . MR. PRESIDENT ? I NEED YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING . EVERYTHING YOU AND I SPOKE ABOUT IN DR. SCOTT 'S LAB - - AND I MEAN EVERYTHING - - STAYS BETWEEN US . WHAT MATTERS NOW IS THE FUTURE AND THAT YOU 'RE HERE WITH US . [ INHALES DEEPLY ] LET ME SHOW YOU TO YOUR NEW QUARTERS . MR. PRESIDENT . MR. PRESIDENT . MR. PRESIDENT . AS YOU WERE . INTERIOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CLOSED CIRCUIT PHONE ALL SET UP , SIR . THIS ROOM IS NOW OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE . THANK YOU , GENTLEMEN . WELL DONE . YOU CAN FINISH THAT UP LATER . YES , SIR . LOOKS LIKE OUR TONER CARTRIDGES ARE FADING A BIT . BUT IT DOES THE JOB , I THINK . IT DOES . BROUGHT A FEW OF MY SHIRTS AND PANTS FOR YOU . ON THE BED THERE . YEAH , THIS ONE FITS PRETTY WELL . AND THE SLEEVES ARE LONG ENOUGH . WE 'LL HAVE YOU COME OUT AND OFFICIALLY MEET THE CREW LATER TODAY . JUST ... SHAKE SOME HANDS , SAY HELLO . OF COURSE . THAT WOULD , UH ... THAT WOULD BE GOOD . ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN DO FOR YOU , SIR ? I 'M GRATEFUL TO YOU , CAPTAIN . I THINK JUST ABOUT ANYONE ELSE WOULD 'VE GIVEN UP ON ME .

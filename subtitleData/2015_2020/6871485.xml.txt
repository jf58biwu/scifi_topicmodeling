 [ Jason Higgins ] Previously an Wayward Pines ... We should have a baby . We found trauma . Possibly from the creature attack , possibly from something else . - I can 't have children . - Are you sure ? [ snarling ] They 're surrounding us . There are more of them every minute . This experiment ends now . [ gunshot ] [ screams ] Hey , think about it . If you kill them , we all die ! [ Dr. Theo Yedlin ] She c0uld 've escaped two minutes ago or two hours ago . She dug from outside until she intercepted the drainage pipe . They 're gonna kill us all . [ waltz music playing ] [ children chattering ] [ ringing ] [ woman ] Abigail 's a very good girl . An excellent girl . Father 's a senator . Mother runs a charitable organization , they 'd like this handled quickly and quietly . She okay playing badminton ? It 's a very low impact sport . Best to keep up appearances for now . She 's not even three months . There . The blond . And the father ? All American lacrosse player . At Chamberlain last year . He 's at Harvard now . And the child will come in December ? - Yes . - Good . At the end of the year , I 'm planning a long trip . It 'd be good for him to be settled by then . Timing is everything , isn 't it ? [ theme music playing ] There could be thousands or even more of them . What are they gathering for ? Looks like Margaret . She might be back with the other females , but ... You should see this . She might be dying . She 's not their only female . If she was their leader and she does die , they 'll pick another one , like if we blow up the tunnels they 'll dig another one . If she is dying , it might buy us more time . How much more time , Kerry ? There 's only one way out . Get CJ and Dr. Yedlin . Come on . She made her choice , pal . I don 't need another one of your lectures . That 's not why I 'm here . I 'm past that . Congratulations . You can invite me to your anniversary party . Baby shower . Look , I don 't know how much time we have left . It could be days , it could be hours , but whatever it is , I 'm not gonna live it with that kid in charge . So what I need to know ... is where you stand . - I don 't matter . - No , you don 't , at all . But I want this to go smoothly . You can help with that . But I 'm doing this with or without you . I won 't be a problem . But I don 't exactly understand the plan . Theyjust got their leader back , right ? There 's a million of them out there , that 's what everyone thinks . They can dig tunnels , they can make ladders . It 's not a question of ifanymore , it 's a question of when . So I 'll support you . Regime change , yeah , I 'm all for it . But what is the plan , Theo ? Do you have some secret strategy , some magic pill to cure the disease , to make all our problems go away ? Or is this just about your tombstone and writing something different on it ? Dr. Yedlin . He wants to see us in the mountain . We have food for a month . We don 't have medicine if people get sick . There are thousands of them right outside the fence . And now that they have their leader back , they could attack us at any moment . We could accept our fate . Tell the people of Wayward Pines . Give them a chance to get their affairs in order . Cling to each other . Say their goodbyes . Await the inevitable . Or we can fight them . There 's one advantage we still have . Pilcher . He believed . They brought us all here in the first place because of that belief . Wrong amount of time , the right idea . The pods ? We 're gonna return here to the mountain where we were all reborn as quickly as possible . No . We 'll go back to sleep , all of us . Three years . We tried the old fashioned way so many times . It was my fault , it was her fault , who knows ? Nowadays , of course , when nature fails , there 's so many new methods . It makes you yearn for an earlier age . So here I am . Alone . You see , I want to leave a legacy . Not of wealth or of titles . A legacy of service and future leadership . A legacy of love . Unconditional love . For humanity . Hello , Abigail . You 're older than I thought . How are you feeling ? I mean , it 's hard to get around and all . And my interview at Princeton 's on hold . But I 'm handling it . - Animal Farm ? - Yea h . Senior year , summer reading . They 're making us . Well , there 's worse things you could be made to do . " Up there , comrades . Up there , just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see , there it lies , Sugarcandy Mountain . That happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labors . " " The creatures outside looked from pig to man , and from man to pig , and from pig to man again , but it was already impossible to say which was which . " Well , yes , but it 's actually quite idealistic . At the beginning . Did you finish it ? Sometimes rules are good . Essential even . - It 's an allegory . - So it doesn 't mean anything ? Maybe 20 years ago it did or 20 years from now , 20,000 years from now , but ... this doesn 't describe my world . Not yet . Well ... It was good to meet you , Abigail . Thank you for your time . Jason . That 's what I call him . [ telephones ringing ] [ indistinct chattering ] Good m 0min g . As leader of this town , I 've been many things . But I 've strived to be one thing above all . Honest . I 've been honest to you about what this place is . Where we are , who we are , andl 'm gonna be honest with you now . Our enemy has moved close , in numbers we 've never seen before . And we don 't know what they ' re planning . But we ha ve to assume the worst , that an in vasian is imminent . And so we need to begin immediate evacuation of Wayward Pines for your own protection . Fortuna tely , there is a plan in place . Shortly after this m eating is 0 ver , we will begin the process ofmoving the residents of Wayward Pines back to the mountain where we will g0 back to sleep until the Abby threat is contained . It ' s safe , it 's safe , it 's all very safe . Andit 's the only way . For how long ? A hundred years ? A hundred thousand years ? That is still being decided , ma ' am . And then what happens ? We should go to the mountain now ! Illa . There ' s aver a thousand of you . We ' llneed an orderly system . S0 please g0 home and wait for instructions . We will come for you . It took Pilcher and his scientists decades to perfect the process . But with the volcanic sun and the use of sulfur gas to kill the bacteria , it 's all very safe . - So you 're dead when you 're in it ? - Not dead . We turn you off . So we can turn you back on again . And I 'll be there to make sure you 're safe , your sister , everyone , every step of the way . I know it seems strange to some of you . You were born here . You 've never known anything but Wayward Pines . But I 've spent more time in and out of these pods than any of you . Even Pilcher . You sleep , awake , awake , asleep . And look at me , I 'm not damaged at all , am I ? [ children mumbling ] Do you dream ? Sometimes . [ dramatic music playing ] We have a problem . - We ran a few tests this morning . - And ? And we 're ready to go . We even have a few empty pods if you have any last minute ideas . Ten days to spare . Thank you , Christopher . And have we decided on the exact positions ? - [ phone rings ] - Oh , excuse me . Hello . Speaking . [ woman ] Abigail has run into camplica tians . What do you mean ? [ woma n ] Abigail went into labor early . It wasn 'ta smooth delivery . When ? Last night . Baby didn ' t make it , but we ' re very happy that we were able to sa ve her . Of course . We ' ll be in touch . Of course . L 'm glad she 's okay . Please give my best regards to Abigail and her parents . G0 vern or , we ' re sorry . So should we move up the departure or stick with the current schedule ? David ? We still have a few days . He was the bridge . He was perfect . L 'm sorry . All children are perfect . Only if we can teach them well . You can find another one . L 'm running out of time . You sure about this ? The empty pods have to be charged . We tripled the voltage of the fence . We 've been running the superstructure , this entire town off the core reactor . Nothing 's been funneled here . So they 're not charged at all . Some of them are . While some of them don 't have the energy we 'll need . We put people in them into suspension , they won 't survive . Why didn 't you check this ? We made an announcement . I started to test as soon as I could . How many do we have ? How many pods are actually working ? How many lives can I save ? Five hundred seventy-one . Hi . We 're ready . Excuse me ? We 're ready to go back to sleep . Go home , we 'll come get you when it 's time . That 's okay , we 'll wait here . Dr. Yedlin . Trying to find in all these piles a shred of something that 's gonna help . May I ask you something ? Have you even thought about how long you want to put everyone to sleep ? Or you just spin a dial and see what happens ? Dr. Yedlin , I need you to stop what you 're doing and I need you to do something else . I need basic medical assessments of the people in Wayward Pines . - Physicals ? - Yes . Just review the files that you have . Of everyone in this town ? Look for preexisting conditions . Maybe a simple score of one to five , something like that . L 'll need it in the next few hours . Do the best you can . We can 't start the evacuation without it . You can 't take everyone , can you ? You want to know what kind of shape they 're in so you can decide who you take and who you can leave behind to die . Not all the pods are working . We won 't be able to take everyone , we can only take just over half . Only you and CJ know . I need to make selections . No . Has to be a lottery . It 's the only fair and ethical choice . There are people who are essential , doctor . Like you , for example . What if we did a lottery and you were left behind ? Then I would accept it . It harms the greater good . We 'll take all the first generation , of course . But we need people with valuable skills . Skills that we can use to rebuild civilization . No trouble makers , no defectives . Yes . Well , if it 's so simple , then you 're not gonna need my help . L 'm not saying this is fun , Dr. Yedlin . Are all the first generation , are they valuable because they 're young , their youth ? Or do you judge them on their intellect ? Physical ability , their size ? No trouble makers , no , sir . If you 'd like to form a committee and submit a report in three months , be my guest . We 'll all be dead by then . 'Cause in the meantime , I 'll make the decisions myself . Defectives . Forget the defectives . And I suppose you mean by that the physically disabled , the mentally diminished . I guess in your calculus that 's the easiest call to make . Of course , if someone is unwilling or unable to reproduce certainly they 're a defective . Isn 't that simple , right ? That 's black and white . You can or you can 't . Unless , of course , that defective is someone you love . You know Pilcher wouldn 't take her . She can 't fulfill her grand obligation . You would leave her here to die . But perhaps her death won 't be so painful . [ dramatic music playing ] Rebecca asked to see you . She 's completed the inventory of the building supplies and has some rough projections about what might be out there when we wake up . Great . Everything okay ? - Any luck ? - Not yet . Kerry . There 's a problem with the pods . We can only take roughly half the people . He 's going to make the selections right now . L 'll go talk to him . We should start the evacuation as planned . Then we 'll just stop at some point . Secure the entrance to the mountain and that 's that . You will just do whatever it takes , won 't you ? - What good does telling everyone do ? - Maybe they should know the truth . The truth ? What good has truth done anyone here ? It 's life or death , Doctor . He 's not taking defectives . He said that ? - Did he- - - I tried to tell him how valuable you are , but you know him . He just doesn 't listen , does he ? He 's giving you a death sentence . You can 't sit still for that . - L 'm sure I can find a way . - Take him out . I can 't do that . Iwon 't . Sad irony of Wayward Pines . You starve to death or you get eaten alive . He loves me . He loves Pilcher more . There 'll still be some foundations left to help us give the town some sort ofa layout . But there will be a hundred other variables . For instance , climate change and the evolution of creatures . Are you all right , Jason ? L 'm sorry . Ijust got a lot on my mind . Of course . Getting everyone up here , getting them all settled . A thousand people don 't just move themselves . I heard that you 're expecting . Yeah . That 's right . That 's wonderful , Rebecca . That really is the most important way one can contribute , isn 't it ? It 's one of the ways . It 's an important one , of course , but it 's not the most important . - But the rules say- - - Enough with the rules , Jason . No one 's pointing a gun to your head and forcing you to do anything . Sometimes you just have to do what your heart tells you to . You 're right . You do . L 'll finish this up and come back later . You should go home . For a little while . See him , say goodbye . To the town . [ exhales ] Thank you , Rebecca . Thank you for giving birth to all this . And for being such a productive member of Wayward Pines . Bye , Jason . [ baby crying ] [ phone ringing ] The hospital appreciates your generous donation , Doctor . Obviously the needs ofa public hospital are many , so we can discuss naming rights but there 's also certain shortages of basic equipment . Whatever you feel is best . - But , Dr. Pilcher- - - I need to get these papers signed . Well , whatever 's necessary to get this thing done tonight . Okay . I just know that some of the members of the board would like to- - I don 't have any time . L 'm sorry . It 's on a bit ofa tight schedule . I understand . It 's just that his mother would like to meet you . I know . I know , I promise this won 't take long but she 's young , she 's giving up everything , Doctor , she 'd just like to make sure that her son will be in good hands . She 's asleep . L 'll come back later . No , no , I 'm awake . [ dramatic music playing ] [ exhales ] Hello . Hi . David . Kerry . Feeling all right ? Yes . Well , you know ... You probably thought I 'd be younger . Don 't worry , I ... I 'm just involved in a ... I won 't be his father . I won 't be raising him . There 's a couple in Texas . They 're very excited . I didn 't really have a thought on the matter , which is surprising now that I think about it . Guess I was just focused on , you know , being pregnant and giving birth thing . You 're not from Boise , are you ? Let me guess . Omaha ? Missoula ? Bet you own a bunch of car dealerships or something . L 'm not from Boise . It 's my first time here , in fact . Oh , you 're lucky . L 'm from Scotch flats , about 30 miles away . Born and raised . It 's a small town , you probably never heard of it . Just a dot on a map . If you run , they 'll find you . I only know one small town around here . Nancyville ? They have the outlet mall . Different one . I hope you don 't mind but , the father ? - L 'm sorry . - No , it 's fine . L 've known him since I was seven . But I didn 't really know him . He hurt you ? No . He tried to hurt me . Like my step brother , like my father . But I didn 't let them . Well , don 't worry , it wasn 't either of them . This may be Idaho , but we 're not that twisted . Well , don 't dwell on the past , Kerry . Let 's not even discuss it . Important thing is that you 're strong . I can tell you 're smart . Street smart , they call it . I don 't know if I 'm strong . I know how to survive . L 'm not sure that 's the same thing . The strong do survive . But the meek shall inherit the Earth . I think that 's still open to question . Now about the money . - We don 't have to- - - No , no , no , it 's important . What do you plan to spend it on ? Istanbul . The Grand Bazaar . Hearing the call to prayer at the Blue Mosque . Or Bolivia . The salt flats . Rain drops pulled back into the earth . [ siren blaring in background ] But first , Paris . - Oh , my God , have you been ? - I have . We were reading Proust , do you know him ? It 's kind of totally boring . There 's like twelve books and he describes freakin ' everything , but when he gets it right , it 's just the bite ofa cookie that started it all . - The madeleine . - Yes . [ mellow music playing ] I had to look up what that one was . But then the memories . They overwhelm him . From simply the bite ofa madeleine . Yes . I wanna have memories like that . To replace the ones I have . First I need a life . Maybe you 'll have one . Maybe even a different one . You know maybe I 'll never get out of Idaho at all . The past , you carry it with you wherever you go . No matter what you do . You can 't run from it . You can 't control it . L 'll always be me . It 's already been written . The book of life . Trust me . You can be a different person . Have a different life . I don 't believe that . [ suspenseful music playing ] What ? [ door opens ] Hi . You all right ? No. I 'm not all right . Our situation is difficult . But we have a way out . The Abbies are gathering , but we 'll get everyone to the mountain . We 'll sleep . We 'll all be safe . Jason , what is it ? We won 't be able to take everyone . I can only take half . We can 't let them know . We 've to get the ones that have been selected up here to the mountain as quickly as possible . Just tell me what you need . L 'm glad that it 's all out in the open . This is isn 't easy , you know . Every single person , the choice of who to leave behind , the fate that 's in store for them . It 's difficult . I love you . I love you , too . You 're the person I can share everything with . There 's no secrets between us , complete trust , right ? Right . Always . That 's why I 'm wondering why you didn 't tell me . Tell you what ? You had a child . Dr. Yedlin said he wasn 't sure that that 's for you ... So it 's true ? The baby went to Texas . It was 2000 years ago . Pilcher wanted me . He saw something in me . He chose me . - What else haven 't you told me ? - Nothing ! What else have you lied about ? Nothing. lt 's who we are here now that matters . How do you know the baby went to Texas ? What ? How do you know the baby went to Texas ? What are you talking about ? Where is this coming from ? - How do you know ? - Pilcher told me . Jason , what is happening ? lam your partner in everything . Talk to me . [ grunting ] [ gunshot ] [ Kerry Campbell ] Thepast , you carry it with you where ver you go . Illa matter what you do . You can ' t run from it . You can ' t control it . I 'll always be me . It 's already been written . The Book of Life . [ carousel music playing ] That 's her . She 's just the sort of strong partner I need . [ Jason Higgins ] lt 's very nice to meet you . L 'm Jason Higgins . L 'm Jason Higgins . Hi , I 'm Jason Higgins . Ah ... Kerry . Kerry Campbell . L 'm Jason Higgins . Hi . It 's very nice to meet you . Where am I ? There was an accident in Chicago . Chicago ? I know . [ stuttering ] L-l-look , I apologize . L 'm ... I know it 's all very confusing . It 'll all make sense , soon . I promise . L 'm sorry . [ chuckles ] Wow . Ah ... I 'm sorry . I don 't usually do this part . It 's just ... You 're so beautiful . [ sighs ] I wanted to be the first face you saw when you woke up . Take it easy , okay , you 've been out for a while . How long ? We 'll get to that . There 's time . We 've all the time in the world . Tell me everything . Iwill , Kerry . L 'll tell you everything . I 'll teach you everything . Gonna be fine now . You 're safe . You 'll always be safe . Trust me . [ breathing heavily ] Walcott Prep ... They taught you well .

 [ NARRATOR ] Previously on Dark Matter . Wherever he 's going , whatever he 's doing , it can 't be good for us . You manipulated me , made me complicit in mass murder . [ grunt ] [ ONE ] What the hell man ? ! [ FOUR ] Who are you and where is he ? ! What are you talking about ? ! Oh crap . Heir to the throne of lshida , until I murdered my own father . No , no you didn 't , you didn 't kill him . [ TWO ] Okay , let 's go over the new supplies . Did you find the parts you were looking for ? They didn 't have a compatible regenerator assembly , so ... I thought we might go with these lithium oxide canisters instead . Is that a yes ? Yes . Also I got these welding goggles that are both practical and cool . If you say so . What 've you got ? Real meat , finally . And protein packs . [ TWO ] Hmm . I 'm gonna go put these on ice . Sterile gauze , sutures , antibiotics , and these blue pills that- - [ THREE ] Those are mine . What is that ? Whiskey . Wasn 't on the list , but I remembered for you . You know what was on the list ? - - [ THREE ] What ? - -Juice . Got you covered . What 're you looking at ? Someone was supposed to get seeds for hydroponics . That was Four . Four , this is Two , please come in . Four , where are you ? [ TWO ] He 's not here . [ THREE ] He 's not in his room either . And his blade 's gone , too . Where 's my brother ? [ AKITA ] I 'm sorry , Denka . He could not make it . I 'm here in his place . I don 't like surprises . Then my apologies , because you 're not gonna like this one . [ AKITA ] Drop your weapons and stand back . [ blows landing , grunting ] [ yelling , grunting ] Most of the time , he just blends into the background . You don 't notice him until he speaks up or takes the last of the carrots . Maybe next time we should implement some sort of buddy system . It wasn 't an oversight . I remember him coming back from the station . [ SIX ] So do I. He was here . [ THREE ] Well , he 's not anymore unless he 's hiding somewhere . [ ONE ] Why would he be hiding ? [ FIVE ] Well , sometimes I hide out in the vents when I need to be alone to think . I 'm tracking the location of his comm . [ computer buzzes ] [ THE ANDROID ] It 's here . [ TWO ] Onboard the ship ? On the bridge . Found it ! He left his comm , he packed up his gear . Guys , I think it 's pretty obvious , he wanted us to leave without him . [ FIVE ] But ... why ? He seemed happy here . He seemed nothing . That guy was harder to read than that book he gave me . That book is a classic . Whatever . Pig 's a wimp , spider 's a know-it-all . [ TWO ] We should go back for him . [ SIX ] So that , what , we can confirm what we already know ? [ ONE ] He owes us an explanation . He owes us nothing . Nobody on this ship owes anybody anything . He 's gone . Just let him go . What ? There 's something you should know . [ BOTH yell ] [ katanas clash , grunting ] [ BOTH grunting ] [ BOTH yell , grunt ] He 's royalty ? A prince , next in line to the throne until he was accused of murdering his father , the Emperor . But he didn 't do it . They 're blaming him , but it wasn 't him . [ ONE ] How long have you known about this ? A while . Didn 't we just have a conversation about honesty and trust and not keeping things from one another ? But it was personal information . It was up to Four to share it . Then why did you tell her ? Oh , well she knows everything . [ THREE ] Oh , that 's just great . Four 's a prince . He 's a terrorist- - we still haven 't figured out your deal . What is with all the secrets ? Is there anything that anyone here wants to come clean about right now ? Hmm-g ? 'Cause we 're gonna find out sooner or later . Anyone ? [ SIX ] Okay , back to the issue at hand . What do we do ? [ THREE ] Are you kidding me ? This changes everything . We go back . Oh , now you want to go back . Yeah , if he 's innocent , we should be there , to support him . That 's what friends do . [ SIX ] Oh , and by support him , you mean be there when he regains the throne so you can take advantage of him ? We could all benefit from having a friend like that watching our backs . If this is all true , it 's not going to be as simple as just going back and taking the throne . He 's been on the run for a reason . His stepbrother will help him . His stepbrother 's probably Emperor now . Why the hell would he help him ? Four always used to look out for him growing up . They were close . Well , I 'm guessing things are a little different now . He could be walking into a mess of trouble . And so could we if we follow him . Which is probably why he didn 't tell us . [ THE ANDROID ] I contacted the space station 's authority . According to their security section , someone matching Four 's description boarded a merchant freighter early this morning . The ship is currently in FTL , but once it drops out , I 'll attempt communication . Wouldn 't want me to bleed out before my execution ? Imagine how disappointed everyone would be . Nowhere near as disappointed as I was to see you actually show up . I thought you were smarter than that . And I thought my brother was more honorable . [ FOUR grunts ] I suppose that makes us even then . No , Denka , I 'm afraid you got the worst end of the staff . You almost sound disappointed , Akita-sen . You had so much potential . Again . Ryo ! Why did you hesitate ? I had already won the point . There was no need to strike , Father . [ EMPEROR ] Really ? What is it you think you 're learning here ? Swordsmanship , Father . [ EMPEROR ] No , you 're learning discipline . [ BOTH grunting ] [ RYO ] Ahh ! [ EMPEROR ] You 're learning to respect our ways and traditions . [ BOTH grunting ] [ RYO ] Ugh ! [ EMPEROR ] When you are emperor and your enemies find you vulnerable , do you think they will hesitate ? [ BOTH grunt ] [ RYO ] Ugh ! [ RYO ] Ahh ! I hate him . This is normal . I often despised my own father growing up . Your father was a great man who served this house with honor . But mine is a tyrant . He 's petty and cruel . Your father loves you . He 's preparing you to take the throne someday . You need to be strong and not allow your emotions to get the best of you . Hm ? Time to go . [ ONE ] Running a quality check on the whiskey , I see . So ? What 's the verdict ? Haven 't quite decided yet . This is going to require very thorough analysis . People on this ship have an annoying habit of wandering off . [ ONE ] So , you going after The General again ? You went to a lot of trouble to find him and you almost had him . So I 'm wondering if something like that makes you reconsider . Or does it ... just make you more determined ? He made me complicit in the deaths of thousands , and I wanted to kill him for it . Nothing else mattered . So I tracked him down and I got him . At least , I thought I got him . But you know what ? It didn 't make me feel any better . The anger was still there . Just shifted . W-What do you mean ? Alive , he was the target , the focus of my anger . But when I thought he was gone well , there was only one person left to blame for all those deaths . He tricked you . I let myself get played . You still haven 't answered my question . Are you gonna go after him again ? Eventually . But I 'll take my time , partly because I wanna make sure I get it right this time , but mostly because for now , I need someone to hate besides myself . [ THE ANDROID ] Sorry to interrupt , but I was finally able to make contact with the captain of that merchant freighter . Is Four onboard ? Not anymore . They dropped him off at a former mining colony , apparently on an isolated and rather lawless planet . Why would he go there ? [ THE ANDROID ] According to the captain , his passenger offered very little in the way of conversation . Sounds like our boy . All right . Chart a course . [ AKITA ] You couldn 't have picked a more remote location . [ FOUR ] Independent territory , no government for you to buy off , and an area so densely forested you couldn 't land a shuttle within miles of here . I chose well . Which is why we need to quicken the pace . We don 't want to be caught out here after dark . Afraid of some wild animals , Akita-san ? Loosen my bonds and give me back my blade . I 'll protect you . From what I hear , on this world , wild animals would be the least of our problems . [ ONE ] So what happens when we get to the planet ? Provided he 's still alive , we find him and bring him back . That 's a brilliant plan . Did you brainstorm that one or was it a solo effort ? [ SIX ] Finding him may be tricky , especially if he doesn 't want to be found . Let 's say , for the sake of arguments , we do manage to catch up with him . It 's unlikely he 's coming back with us . So what are you saying ? We just forget about him ? He left . Like it or not , that was his decision . Ah , people change their minds all the time . Look at me . One point , I was all set to leave . At least that 's what you wanted us to think , until you realized no one gave a damn . Actually , only reason I stuck around was to see how long it would take for all them to figure out that you 're a total fraud . Not that long , it turns out . [ THREE grunts ] [ laughs ] - - [ THREE ] Agh ! - -Hey ! Knock it off ! [ ONE yells ] [ THREE ] Come on , pretty boy ! - -Huh ? ! - - [ ONE snarls ] [ THREE yelpS ] [ ONE growls ] I said knock it off ! Ow ! What the hell are you two thinking ? Ask your boyfriend . He 's the one who threw the first punch . I got nothing to say . [ THREE ] He 's been in space too long . He 's going a little loopy . What 's so fascinating ? [ THE ANDROID ] I 'm running a full diagnostic . [ THREE ] Why are you reading the results ? Isn 't your robot brain connected to the ship ? It is , but I find that visual observation stimulates unique thought processes . In retrospect , it could be a symptom of my condition . What condition ? A possible flaw in my programming . It 's been brought to my attention that my behavior is sometimes unreasoned , atypical of android standard . Weird . Yeah . [ THE ANDROID ] Given your observation , how would you typify my behavior ? Weird about sums it up . In the event I 'm unable to identify the issue , a full reboot may be the only recourse . Sure , do what you gotta do . Hang on a sec . What does that mean , " full reboot " ? You would delete my memory stores and current personality matrix . No-no-no-no , no way . Then you 're satisfied with my performance , despite my aberrant behavior ? Hell no . But I 'll be damned if I gotta start over with a whole ' nother robot . That 's kind of him to say ... [ knocking ] Come in . - -He started it . - -Try again . - -He deserved it . - -Irrelevant . How is that irrele- - He 's an obnoxious loudmouth , everyone knows it . So what ? Maybe I just got fed up . No . I don 't buy that macho crap , I expect it from him , not you . You 're smarter than that . What , I 'm smarter , so I should know better ? He 's stupid and he gets a pass ? I want us to be honest with each other . We can do that , right ? Sure . Right ... ? I know why I assumed Jace Corso 's identity and snuck aboard this ship . I came here to kill Three . I ran a data search using my genetic info from the transfer pods at the last stopover . This is what it came back with . I had a wife . And he killed her . It says he was a suspect , the charges were never proven . [ ONE ] Because they never caught him to stand trial . Obviously , I decided to take matters into my own hands . Do you remember her ? E-Even a little ? No ? Should that make a difference ? You tell me . How do you mourn someone you don 't remember ? I don 't know . All I know for sure is that this is my life now . Trapped in this flying metal box , constantly looking over my shoulder on the run . And he put me here . Like it or not he and everyone else on this ship are all that you 've got . And how long before we turn on each other ? Before someone sells us out ? You said it yourself , according to Five , whoever wiped our memories did it because they thought we were dangerous . What does that mean ? It means they wanted us nice and docile so they could take the ship , collect the bounty on our heads , or both . That was a lifetime ago . We 've already proven nobody remembers . So what 're you saying ? We 're all new people now ? Fresh start ? Everyone gets a do-over ? There was a time not too long ago when you would 've agreed that we could change . Make up for past deeds . That was before- - [ TWO ] Before what ? ! Before you found out you weren 't one of us ? Some people turn bad , circumstances push them in that direction , I get it . But some people are born that way . And they lie , murder , cheat , and steal . And they 'll turn on you , sooner or later , because it 's in their nature . Three is rotten to the core . You know I 'm right . We all might sleep better if we cut our losses . [ FOUR ] Aren 't you gonna ask me ? Ask you what ? About the night in question . If I murdered my father . You 're not curious ? The truth will come out eventually . Why wait ? [ AKITA ] I 'm delivering you as ordered . No matter what you say , it won 't make a difference . Even if I 'm innocent ? Even if you tell me you 're innocent . I spoke to you that night , in the corridor . You were drunk , Denka . And very angry . I should have escorted you back to your room , but instead , I let you go , and that decision will haunt me to my dying day . I 'd just learned about my brother being sent away . You may not have liked it but sending your brother away was the right thing to do . He 'd become a distraction to you . [ FOUR ] And how ironic that he now sits on the throne while I 'm a thorn in everyone 's side . Your father always feared your impetuousness would be your downfall . No . It was my predictability . When I went to confront him that night , my father was already dead . My stepmother had cut his throat and simply waited for me . [ FOUR ] You don 't seem surprised . Is it because you think I 'm a liar or is it because I 'm finally confirming something you had already suspected ? Which one is it ? As I said , I should have stopped you . [ SIX grunting ] - -Hiya ! - - [ SIX gasps ] [ grunts ] I think you 're lifting way too heavy . Y 'know , you 've been kind of grumpy lately . [ SIX ] I 've had a lot on my mind . [ SIX grunts ] Look , if you 're looking for someone to play games with , try the Android . I-I 'm not here to play games , I 'm here to learn . I want you to teach me how to fight . No . [ FIVE ] Why not ? You were teaching One , and I 'm as much a member of this crew as he is . No , you 're not like us , and you shouldn 't want to be like us . You 've got our memories in your head . You know . We 've crossed a line and we can 't ever go back . We can 't undo all the hurt we 've caused . And no matter how far or fast we fly this ship , sooner or later that past is gonna catch up with us . And when it does , there 's gonna be hell to pay . So teach me how to protect myself . [ SIX ] You want to know how to protect yourself ? Walk away . Take your share of what 's owed you , get off at the next space station , and buy yourself a ticket to anywhere you want to go . But I don 't want to go . You guys are my friends . [ SIX ] No , we are not . We 're just a bunch of strangers thrown together by circumstance . Y 'know how many of us would jump at the chance to abandon ship if it meant we could get away free and clear ? Every last one of us . [ FIVE sniffs ] Look , I-I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to hurt your feelings . I just don 't want to see you pay for our mistakes . Well , it 's too late . I almost died for you guys , trying to dig your secrets from inside my head . And when that crazy android tried to destroy the ship , she was trying to kill all of us , including me . So , I don 't care what you say , I am a member of this crew . And ... if you don 't think so , well then , maybe YOU should go . [ SIX growls ] It 's quite the tidy little plot if you ask me . Murder the Emperor , blame it on me , take me out of the picture so that her own son can take over the throne . Tell me , Akita-san , has your sense of duty managed to smother what remains of your conscience ? You speak of honor and allegiance to the throne , but all you really are is a co-conspirator , a traitor to my father and everything that he stood for . I was like a father to you in ways he never was . I trained you , protected you , refused to give up on you even when your own flesh and blood were ready to do so . Then you should know me and trust me when I say that I will retake my throne and the usurpers will pay . I need your help , Akita-san . [ MAN ] Ah , I hate to interrupt you two lovebirds but you fellas look lost . This is a bad place to get lost in . My name is Akita Masahida . I 'm here fulfilling my duties as a royal officer to the Court of lshida . This man is a wanted criminal and I 'm returning him to face justice . I request safe passage through your territory in the name of the Principality of Zairon . Well , as the self-appointed governor of this territory , I 'm gonna have to respectfully deny your request for safe passage and ask that you hand over your valuables ... for inspection . You will be compensated for your help . Oh. yeah ? How much you got ? Nothing with me , but once I deliver the prisoner- - Ahh , you will come back , right ? You have my word . You know what , I 'd rather have them fancy boots you got on . Toss aside your weapons . Ahh ! [ ALL grunting ] [ AKITA grunts ] [ MAN whimpers ] Please , I have a wife ... children ! They can do better . [ MAN grunts ] [ gun clicks ] Your sword , Denka . [ TWO ] Hey . [ THREE ] Hey . One day I 'm scraping by on powdered porridge , the next , I 'm eating all the dehydrated veg chips that I can stand . Success is sweet . And salty ... You know that when I taste the green ones , there 's this little tickle in the back of my mind , like I 'm trying to remember something , but I just- - I just can 't . It 's only the green ones . Here . [ THREE ] I keep wondering ... Maybe if I just think hard enough , or ... eat hard enough ... maybe I might remember , but ... [ THREE ] What ? Oh , I don 't know , it 's like Four with his weapons or Six with the Marauder , Five fixing things ... It 's something I just have . It 's like instinct . Muscle memory . [ THREE ] Mm-hmm . It 's an action you repeat so many times it creates this long-term memory in your brain . One so powerful that flying or fixing or that becomes automatic . Right . So , tell me , when you found out One wasn 't really Jace Corso , Why 'd you keep his secret ? I told you . I saw an opportunity , I took it , that 's it . [ TWO ] And you weren 't worried about the potential consequences ? Consequences ? Guy 's about as dangerous as white bread . I 'm talking about you . You didn 't even consider that if the rest of us found out , it would hurt your standing with this crew ? I didn 't think I had a standing . Okay , yeah . I did consider it , but I decided to play the odds . It was the wrong decision . What do you want me to say ? That I learned a valuable lesson ? Sure . No more secrets . We need to trust each other . Do we ? Because we are who we are . We 're not gonna change . And more than likely , we 're just gonna fall back into our old habits . Muscle memory : killing , thieving- - Betraying ? Somebody gutted our memories ... probably because they thought it would make it easier to handle us . Make it easier to turn us in . One of us is a traitor . You wanna play process of elimination ? After you . Okay . Five . Computers and gadgets are her thing . Double-dealing and conspiracy not so much . Six is a suspect in a mass murder . Innocent or not , that type of rap sheet doesn 't offer much in the way of deal opportunities . Four . He 's got that weird nobility thing going on . He 'd rather lop off his own arm than dishonor himself by betraying us . Which leaves us with three possibilities . You , me , or One . [ FOUR ] We should stop . The only way we 're getting back to the ship is if I carry you and I 'd rather not . Let me dress your wounds . You have my word I won 't attempt an escape . Unlike my brother , my word actually means something . [ AKITA grunts ] I 've long-served the Emperor with honor . Sacrificed and risked my own life for the Court of lshida . But this is by far the most difficult thing ever asked of me . I wish they had sent someone else instead . Anyone else would be laying dead in the snow back there . [ AKITA ] True . [ AKITA ] A part of me looked forward to seeing you again . Honestly facing you in ... actual combat after so many years of training . And was I a worthy adversary ? You always were . More so today . But I honestly wish you had reconsidered your agreement with Hiro and not shown up . On that we can agree . You claim your innocence , and you appeal to my conscience , but you do not press your most persuasive argument . I owe you my life . [ EMPEROR ] Three fleet destroyers , 48 fighters , over 26,000 lives lost . The greatest military defeat in the history of Zairon . What do you have to say for yourself , Commander ? I saw the opportunity to press the advantage and took it . You blundered into a trap . I was reckless . I take full responsibility for my actions . Is it possible one of your generals forced your hand by striking preemptively ? No , Kotei-sama . I ask you again , Akita-san . Isn 't it possible that one of your generals responded rashly to the enemy provocation , thus forcing your hand ? No , Kotei-sama . Do you know what this means ? For failing in my duties as an officer of this court , death . Very well . You leave me no choice but to order your execution . [ RYO ] No ! Do that , and you 'll be killing an innocent man . What are you doing here , Ryo ? Accepting responsibility for the failed attack on the Pyrian armada . Your son had nothi- - [ RYO ] While I appreciate the Royal Commander 's desire to shield me from your wrath , I respectfully remind him that I am no longer a boy in need of his protection . I alone bear responsibility for this disastrous campaign . I gave the order to attack . Kotei-sama . You ? Ordered a full-scale assault on the enemy forces ? You are always bemoaning my lack of killer instinct . I assumed you 'd be pleased . Akita-san , you are dismissed . We never spoke of that day . I never thanked you . Done . I owe you a debt . And that debt will be paid . [ SOLDIER ] Commander ! Where 's the rest of your squad ? Dead . Your orders , sir ? I 'm sorry , Denka . Arrest the prisoner . [ SOLDIER ] You were late , so I decided to come for you . [ AKITA ] And well , you did . [ TWO ] Thanks , boys . We 'll take it from here . [ AKITA ] Who 's " we " ? Me and my armed friends surrounding you . This man is wanted for the murder of Emperor lshida Nihei of the Principality of Zairon . He 's being returned to his homeworld for trial . That man is wanted on our ship . I believe we have a stalemate . Lieutenant ! [ SOLDIERS grunt ] [ grunting ] [ TWO ] We spotted the group when we landed ; followed them after they left their ship . Six is waiting for us at the Marauder , back that way about 30 minutes . The decision is no longer mine to make . [ AKITA ] I wish you luck , Denka , but know this , should our paths cross again , I will fulfill my duty as an officer of the Royal Court and bring you in . Of that , I have no doubt . Akita-san , I want you to deliver a message to my brother . Of course . [ knocking ] Listen , I know you 're in there . I just wanted to say I 'm sorry . Of course you 're a part of this crew . You 've earned your place here with us , and you 've earned the right to make your own decisions . Doesn 't mean I 've changed my mind . I still think you 're better off as far away from us as possible . But the truth is , when the time comes and you do decide to leave , I 'm gonna miss you , kid . I 'm gonna miss you a lot . And I 'm sorry I said you should go . And for calling you a big , dumb jerk . You called me a big , dumb jerk ? Later , when I was alone in my room . [ chuckles ] Well , I guess I deserved it . Now , come on out of there . The Android says we 're about 40 minutes out from a planet with waterfalls , pristine beaches , and tree fruit so sweet it 'll burst your eyeballs . [ giggles ] The way I see it , you 're up one . One , what ? [ THREE ] On that freighter , you saved me from getting blasted out into space , plus one . But then I saved you a little bit later from those infected crazies so that makes us even . On the space station we both sorta saved each other , so ... we 'll call that a draw . And then when that robot tried to fly us into the sun , well , I saved us all , so , plus one for me . But then later you saved me , so plus one for you , we 're even . And there was today . I wasn 't keeping score . But me being one up sounds about right . We stood by and watched him kill an unarmed man . Didn 't exactly give us a lot of time to react , did he ? Plus , it was a personal matter . Can 't help but wonder what kind of person we brought back on board with us . [ knocking ] Come in . [ FOUR ] Am I interrupting ? No . I-I 'm just going over ship systems . I wanted to thank you . It was wrong of me to leave without explanation . Why did you ? Truthfully ? I didn 't want to involve any of you . Have you risking your lives on my behalf . While I appreciate that , you 've got to understand , we didn 't go back just for you . We went back for us . We 're not just acquaintances that come and go , now we have to fight for each other , no one else will . Some day , with your help , I 'll take my rightful place on the throne . And on that day , I 'll remember my true family , after I 've dealt with the old one . [ HIRO ] Mother ! [ HIRO ] Mother ! You tricked me ! You sent Akita-san in my place and now he 's dead . Better him than you . [ HIRO ] I gave Ryo my word that I would meet him . He promised to tell me the truth about what happened to Father . We already know . Ryo murdered him . No . He claims it was a conspiracy from within the court . With whose backing ? [ HIRO ] He didn 't say . He would only reveal the details of the plot once we were face to face . And you believed him ? [ HIRO ] Ryo has never lied to me . I gave him my word . You made me a liar . No , my son . I made you an Emperor . [ ALL laughing ] [ loud rumbling ] What was that ? [ sirens sound ] Wh [ ONE ] at happened ? ! Three Ferrous Corp. destroyers just dropped out of FTL . Get us out of here . Their opening salvo took out our FTL drives . We 're not going anywhere .

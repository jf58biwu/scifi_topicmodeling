 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... - Bobbi 's phone 's back in service . - Could be a trap . First person through this door ... [ imitates explosion ] ... brains everywhere . - You are leading them into a war ! - SHIELD must be destroyed . [ thud ] Take her with you . Restrain her . Weaver : Director Coulson , we are under attack from an unknown number of gifted assailants . They have killed dozens of my men . - We need your help . - Now what ? Now ... we begin . I believe ... I think it 's an ill-conceived attempt at super strength . Uh-oh . [ tires screech ] [ grunts ] Now it 's just you and me . [ grunts ] 2x22 - S.O.S. / part 2 / [ metal scraping ] This won 't hold me for long , Phil . [ grunts ] [ tires screech ] It 'll hold you long enough . [ beep ] [ grunts ] [ laughs ] The hangar 's been emptied , locked down . [ sighs ] It 's just us , Cal , to have a little chat ... When I get free , I will rip your voice box out of your throat ! ... and try to come to our senses . Either we walk out of here together , or not at all . You got it ? We both want the same thing . What I want is to snap your spine like celery . See , I don 't think you really do . Well , let 's test your hypothesis . Oh , I think you 're willing to , but want is a different thing . What we both want is to protect your daughter . [ grunts ] You 're a family man . Who is sick of you sticking your nose in our business . It was your devotion to them that made you willing to do those terrible things all those years ago , wasn 't it ? - Shut up . - Nightmarish acts of violence that you didn 't want to commit , did you ? - Your wife made you do it . - You don 't know her ! [ grunts ] You don 't know anything ! Say one more word , and I 'll ... I 'm not saying your wife is a monster , Cal . [ grunting ] I think you already know she 's a monster . What I 'm saying is ... you 're not . I know you 've thought so for a long time . But deep down , you 're a good man . [ scoffs ] I believe that . I do . - You got a big heart full of love . - Stop . You wear it on your sleeve . Skye got that from you . - No . - That 's right . No , stop ! Stop ! You were just trying to save her , trying to please your wife . No , I was trying to put my family back together ! [ breathes deeply ] I ... I reassembled her ... piece by piece ... sewed her back up ... - but she was never the same . - She was out for blood . Before Whitehall , an elder would sacrifice themselves every few decades so she could live on , carry on tradition . She would weep , scream , beg them not to . [ breathes deeply ] She had a good heart , Phil . She did . It was just ... torn out . [ breathes deeply ] And she needs to take lives to heal . - So you supplied them . - Yes , a village of them . But it was never enough . She didn 't care about human life anymore . Even I had to change myself to be worthy in her eyes . I thought I could fix her if I could just make good on my promise . I promised to protect our daughter . Does that include protecting your daughter from her ? [ grunts ] You know Skye now ... her compassion . [ grunts ] Jiaying 's out for blood , and there 's no way in hell Skye will go along with that . Think about the danger that puts her in . [ grunting ] [ metal scraping ] She 's not my daughter , but she 's as close to family as I 've got , and I will save her , no matter what the cost . [ grunts ] Please ... let me help you . [ metal clinking ] You want to lend me a hand getting these things off ? Or a face ? Mack ? Thank god . Who 's with you ? Just you and me , tremors . [ beep ] Your people just took over the ship . About 100 or so prisoners . The rest are dead . Guess they 're not as harmless as you say . I swear , I never meant for any of this to happen . I ... Well , we need to stop them . But if you 're in here , I 'm guessing you figured that out already . It 's my mother . She 's manipulating them . Not all of these people are bad . They 're using their powers to kill SHIELD agents , so I don 't give a damn about intentions right now . - I came here because I need your skills . - I can 't use my powers . - They locked these inhibitors on me . - Not the skills I 'm looking for . Heard you have a history of hacking into SHIELD . [ beep ] Man : That 's the fan room , down on the fourth deck . All the ship 's air circulates through it . Take a case of crystals down there . Load the rest on the Quinjet . [ door opens ] We have a problem . I disabled the communication systems , but an emergency beacon was sent out to Coulson 's base . It 's hard-wired , and there 's no way to cancel it without the proper code . [ panting ] Do one of you have the code ? I suggest you surrender peacefully . When Coulson gets the message , he 'll come at you with everything he has . Coulson 's being dealt with . I don 't need you to cancel the beacon . I want you to expand it . This ship and Coulson 's base aren 't the full extent of SHIELD 's operations . Expand the beacon . Invite them all . You want them to know we 're here ? We have to show them what we 're capable of . It 's the only way they 'll ever leave us alone . We don 't know what you 're planning , but we 'll play no part in it . - Hands off , you freak ! - What are you doing ? Let him go ! - Do you like rare gems ? - You don 't think you can bribe me . It 's not a bribe . It 's an incentive . [ clink ] [ men screaming ] [ screaming stops ] Expand the beacon , or there will be more . Mack : If we don 't cut that beacon , it 'll bring every available agent racing here . And she plans to do that to all of them . The problem is , it 's hard-wired , clear on the other side of the ship , with a dozen ginger ninjas and god knows who else standing in the way . - But we 're still gonna try . - Hell yeah . Well , his physical changes have improved . Careful . I 'm a married man . Sorry , Phil . This looks expensive . We have a tab running . Sir , the carrier 's distress call ... it 's expanded to all channels . Jiaying used Cal 's distraction to take over that ship in minutes . Yeah . It 's intimidating . You get May and Hunter on the line ? We 'll need every asset we 've got to shut these Inhumans down . I tried , sir . Uh , their team 's already gone dark . [ sighs ] Ward : There he is , poor sap ... - not a clue what he 's walking into . - I didn 't think May would be with him . She could screw the whole thing up for us . Well , we 'll make sure Hunter and Bobbi get their reunion ... by taking the rest out one by one . Don 't worry about May . I 'll take care of her . I owe her that . [ panting ] Take that all the way . Check every room . Bob ? Bobbi ? Bob ? I 'm coming to find you , Bobbi . [ panting ] [ grunting ] Bobbi . [ grunting ] - Agent May ? - Not really . [ gunshots ] Agent Walker took the South corner , right ? He still radio silent ? All agents converge on the South corner . I 'll meet you there . Do not lower your guard until you see my face . - Hunter 's the only agent left . - She doesn 't know that . Bobbi . I 'm coming for you , Bob . [ panting ] [ grunting ] [ clanging ] Bob ! Come on ! Stay with me , Bob ! [ panting ] Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on , Bob . Bob , Bob . Stay with me . Stay with me . Bobbi . Bobbi . Stay with me . [ gasping ] Please , please . I 've got you . I 've got you . [ grunts ] [ gunshots ] [ gasping ] Baby ... No ... Kara ? No , no . Kara , no . Kara , look at me . Look at me ! No , no , no , no ! No , Kara ! Look at me , baby . Come on . [ gasping ] It 's ... It 's ... Oh , god . Oh , god . Please . Please , Bobbi . Come on . Help . We need to get her out of here ! I 'm losing her ! Easy , easy . [ panting ] Gordon : Beautiful , isn 't it ? I don 't know about beautiful , but I 'm guessing it 's dangerous . In the wrong hands , lethal to our people . [ scoffs ] It 's better we have control over it . And what about us ? How dangerous are we ? Very . We 've always been . Now they know it . What Jiaying did in there was ... that was murder . That was necessary . She 'll do whatever 's needed to protect our people . You know that better than most . Are you forgetting your life before we found you ? Of course I haven 't forgotten . Then you remember how far she went to save you and know how far she will go to save all of us . We 're not doing anything that SHIELD itself wouldn 't do . They have turned Jiaying 's own daughter against us . We have her locked up now , but given how lethal Skye is , it could get worse . You 'd be wise to remember that . She just killed them ... all of them ... - didn 't even think about it . - Yeah , I thought my mom was bad - when she started watching Fox News . - And I fell for the whole act . Look , you had to choose between two ... this way . This way . You had to choose between two sides that both mean something . I get it . You make the best choice you can . Sometimes , it works out . Sometimes ... - It didn 't . - It did not . Beacon 's in the sat room down to the left . Go get started . Try to hack the code and turn it off . - Wait . Where are you going ? - To find a power saw in case you can 't . Sir , good news . I 've modified my field generators to act in unison as a quantum-field disrupter . Great , you 're saying you found a way to shut down Gordon 's teleportation ability ? - Well , now my news sounds less good . - Oh . Sorry . The disrupter should keep him contained to a single space . I 'll take anything . We have Quinjets flying in from all over the world right now to answer the S.O.S. with us . It will be nice to have something more to offer them than an encouraging thumbs-up . - What about Bobbi ? - Landing any moment . Cal destroyed the lab . It 's unusable right now . This is our best option . We 'll make it work . Any update from May on Bobbi 's condition ? They 've slowed the bleeding . She 's holding on , but barely . - Okay . - We 'll see . And is Cal stable enough to join the mission on the carrier ? - Why would you want Cal on the mission ? - That doesn 't sound like a very good idea . Gunshot wound to the upper back . Exit wound in the chest . Pulse is 140 and weak . B.P. ' s 60 over 30 . She stopped breathing just before we landed . I bagged her ... got her going again . Hurry . 1 , 2 , 3 . Let 's get her prepped for surgery . CBC with diff , chem-20 . Portable chest x-rays . - Cross and type for two units . - Yes , doctor . [ monitor beeping ] [ beep ] How did you get out ? - Lincoln . I-I can explain . - Don 't bother . [ electricity crackles ] [ electricity crackles ] [ gasps , grunts ] [ breathing heavily ] You 've got this wrong ... very wrong . - Listen , please . - I just found you trying to reach out to your SHIELD friends . You planning the next assault ? That attack didn 't happen , Lincoln . Jiaying staged the whole thing . She murdered Gonzales , then shot herself to frame SHIELD so we 'd follow her to war . Do you even hear how crazy that sounds ? Shot herself ? She 's already healed , hasn 't she ? I 'd tell you to ask Raina ... she can see the future ... but she 's not here , is she ? [ grunts ] She 's not here because she had a vision of what happened , what 's going to happen . And Jiaying couldn 't risk her talking , so she cut her throat . Why are you doing this ... trying to turn us against her ? You saw what she did with those crystals ... killed unarmed agents . Okay , think . Why would she want the rest of SHIELD to come here ? It 's ... It 's not to hug it out . She wants to execute them . We can stop this . Please , just tell me where she took the crystals . The fan room ... where the ship 's air circu ... [ grunts ] - Found a saw . - I was getting through to him . Right now , I 'm in a " crack heads first , ask questions later " frame of mind . Here . Hack that beacon or just cut it . I 'm gonna make sure those crystals don 't hurt anyone else . Mack , you know what happens if one breaks - near a vent , near you . - That 's why they won 't . [ monitor beeping ] Andrew : Melinda ? I just wanted to hear your voice . You haven 't made a call like this since Bahrain . - [ sighs ] Yeah . - Well , then I know it 's not good . Do you want to tell me what 's going on ? How bad are we talking ? There 's no way it will end well . Andrew ... there 's a lot I didn 't say that I wish I did . Me , too . Do good , Melinda , and get home safe . [ beep ] You 'll be careful ? I won 't be careful . I 'll get the job done . Well , w-watch your back because I just saw Hunter with Bobbi , and it made me realize that ... I ... well , it 's just that w ... we never really spoke about ... what you said to me at the bottom of the ocean . This ? Now ? - You want to talk about this now ? - No . [ chuckles ] We ... We don 't ... uh ... it means a lot to me that we 're friends again , and I , um ... maybe when you get back , we could finally just talk about it . It 's ... [ sighs ] - There 's nothing to discuss , Jemma . - Maybe there is . Agent Fitz , we 're on the move . [ inhales sharply ] [ whimpers ] May : I 'd like to formally voice my doubts about bringing him on this mission . I understand your concerns , May , but Cal 's lived with the Inhumans . He knows what we 're getting ourselves into . We do not . He 's a loose cannon . Worse comes to worst , we let the cannon loose . Any distraction might help us take that boat . Look , Cal 's erratic , but if there 's one constant , it 's his concern for Skye . Sir , something 's happening with the S.O.S. signal from the boat . I thought it was breaking up , like someone cutting the line . Radio interference ? No , but there 's , um , uh , a pattern to it , like a code . It 's Skye . What 's she saying ? That it 's a trap . [ beep ] This is SHIELD 218 ordering all other forces to fall back . - Repeat . Fall back . - And what about us ? We 're gonna finish this . [ engines roar ] All the SHIELD jets have turned around except one . Someone must have warned them . Go check Skye 's cell . What do you want to do with the rest of the prisoners on this ship ? - If SHIELD 's not coming ... - Then there 's no reason to wait . Break the crystals . Release the mist . Either they 're Inhuman ... or they 're dead . [ engine roars ] We don 't know the size of the force we 're up against , but priority one is saving the crew of the ship . Find them . Free them . May , head to operations . Take control of the ship 's functionality . Sir , um , Skye 's last message came through . It reads , " modified crystals lethal ... HVAC room . " Does she mean the Terrigen crystals that release the mist ? Yeah . But " modified " and " lethal . " And the HVAC room controls the ship 's ventilation . Ah ! So that 's what this little mutiny 's all about . Gas them all . See what shakes loose . - Not if I get to her first . - Oh , no , no . Not you , Phil . This is a family matter . My wife , my responsibility . You just find those crystals and leave her to me . - [ scoffs ] You brought him . - All right , everybody . - It 's Gordon , right ? - And you are ? I 'm the guy who kills Gordon . Jiaying : I want you to remain behind . Gather anyone who makes it through the mist alive . What are you doing with those ? What I 've always done . There are descendants everywhere . I 'm going to find them and build them a better world , where they 're not hunted , not afraid . And kill anyone in your way . Only if they 're in our way . - Goodbye , Daisy . - No , wait ! [ energy pulsing ] [ grunts ] Come on , no-eyes ! Show yourself ! [ breathing heavily ] " No-eyes " ? That is the best you can do ? Oh , you want clever ? Come a little closer . I 'll get real clever . You 're different than the others . I sense you 've encountered something Kree . - Wasn 't pleasant . - I can imagine . So why don 't you put that thing down , - avoid any further unpleasantness ? - I don 't think so . I 've seen what these crystals can do . So if you want them , you 're gonna have to come get ... [ grunts ] Hiya , honey . What you been up to ? You came back here ... with them ? I know . I know what you 're thinking . But I 've been thinking some thoughts of my own , like ... maybe we both kind of lost our heads . Get out of the way , Cal . No . You need to stop this . This isn 't about us or them . This is about our daughter . Think of what you are doing to Daisy . I 'm trying to protect her from the cruelty of this world ... like you swore to . I know . I failed you . I failed you both . But we can turn this around . It is not too late . For you ... - It is . - Where 's Daisy ? ! [ grunts ] [ whoosh ] What did you do ? ! Where 's Daisy ? ! Where 's Daisy ? ! [ panting ] - What the hell took you so long ? - It 's a big boat with poor signage . That no-eyed guy keeps popping in here , trying to get at these crystals . - If he breaks them ... - Everybody 's a statue . - We heard . Fitz ? - On it . - Here . Take this . - Thanks , but I 'll stick with the ax . Ricochets in here will be bad . - And trust me , you will miss . - Right . - What are those things ? - Quantum field disrupters . Should contain him here if he comes back . - Of course . Why didn 't I think of that ? - That 's okay . You 've been busy , and you 're not a quantum physicist . It 's completely understandable . Jiaying 's not the only one who can set a trap . You know , I batted over .400 in little league . Aah ! [ grunts ] [ both grunting ] [ grunting ] Lincoln : Hey ! [ electricity crackling ] [ breathing heavily ] - My head still hurts . - I 'm sorry . I didn 't know . You didn 't know . But now we have to stop Jiaying . Might help if we lose these . [ electricity crackles ] Hurry . There will be more redheads coming . I 'll go after her . - Skye , I 'll do it . I 've done it before . - No . - You have to be willing to ... - I won 't hesitate . Whatever it takes . Go . [ grunts ] Damn it , you sneaky son of a ... [ grunts ] I hate this guy . - Fitz , hurry the hell up ! - Yeah , I 'm almost there , - but I need him back in the room before ... - Fitz , now ! Hit it ! [ whirring ] [ energy pulsing ] [ grunts ] I 'm trapped in here . That 's not possible ! What did you do ? ! - Science , biatch . - Looks like it 's batter up , director . Mom ! Stop ! You can 't do this ! No , put them on the jet and get ready for takeoff . I can 't let you leave with those crystals . You can , and you should . It 's the only way to protect our people . - It 's not . There are other ways . - Whose ways ? SHIELD ? - No . Their way is what got us here . - You started this war . This war started decades ago , when SHIELD was founded to guard the world against people like us . And it will never end . But you and I together ... think of how powerful we could be . We could launch a revolution ... side by side . I don 't want your revolution , because this isn 't about protecting me or your people . - This is about hate . - No , you 're wrong . It 's consumed you . You can 't even tell right from wrong . I can 't let you destroy any more lives . My daughter . So beautiful . So strong . [ gasps ] [ gasping ] Mom , what are you ... I always believed the reason I endured all that torture and pain was for you , that you were my true gift . But you 're not . This is . [ gasping ] Don 't ... do this . You made your choice . I 'm sorry . No ! [ grunting ] [ bones crack ] They 're gonna keep coming . Not if we take out the source . - Got her . - We 're not bad . We 're misled . [ electricity crackling ] [ wheezing ] Attaboy , turbo . [ screaming ] [ groaning ] [ gasping ] Please . Stop . You don 't have to do this . You don 't have to live with that pain . I will . [ bones crack ] [ weakly ] Oh ... Cal ... what are you doing ? Keeping my promise . [ gasps ] [ bones crack ] [ crying ] [ whirring ] Andrew : You ready to talk about it ? - About what ? - [ scoffs ] Your arm . Not yet . I 'm looking into some options . I 'd rather hear your evaluation of my team . Did you manage to get an accurate read on Bobbi ? I get pretty straight answers with morphine in the mix . [ monitor beeping ] Hey . Hey . - You look better . - Hmm . Stupid , but better . Taking a bullet for me was stupid . Walking into a trap when you know it 's a trap is stupid . You were the bait . Listen , Bob , hang in there . It 's a long road . Surgery again tomorrow . They haven 't even started on your knee yet . But soon , you 'll be stable , and then ... And then ... I can 't do this anymore . - You convinced Mack not to quit . - Yeah , well , he kind of owed me after cutting off my hand without asking . He respects you . But he still holds a deep distrust of all the alien artifacts you 've encountered . That 's why I put him in charge of them . Jemma : You know , we could get better readings if we dropped a probe into the glass enclosure . No , we 're never opening that damn box in 1,000 years . So , May asked for some time off for the first time in the history of ever . Does that have anything to do with you being around these last few days ? Now , you know I can 't discuss personal matters with patients . I 'm your patient now ? I wasn 't your patient the other night when you and your ex-wife snuck into my office and drank up half my scotch . Ah , it 's time May rediscover the world outside of SHIELD , don 't you think ? That your report ? No , no , these are my recommendations for the new program . You bringing other people in on this yet ? Slowly . I got Fitz working on these designs . - We 'll need to be mobile . - Yeah . Thank you . I 'm glad you think Skye 's ready for this . At this point , I think she 's ready for anything . [ breathes deeply ] This is so long ... for now . After all I 've done , I 'd be a fool to think I 'd get a Hollywood ending . Came close . I found you and got to ... You know , you 're better than I imagined , and I imagined you perfect . [ chuckles ] You 're way more interesting than that . [ chuckles ] I wonder where I get that from . [ laughs ] Ah . It 's paradoxical , isn 't it ... my love for my family is what drove me mad ? I know I 'm going away for good , but I was hoping ... you might come visit ... - once in a while ? - I will . - I promise . - [ sniffles ] That would be ... Let me guess [ chuckles ] " the best day ever ? " [ both chuckle ] You have a lot of those . No . Just one . July 2 , 1988 . [ both crying ] [ sighs ] [ beep ] [ sighs ] Man : Looks like you 're having trouble letting go ... hate to see that , my friend . Did she walk out on you ? She drowned when her lungs filled up with blood . These are all the names you could drum up ? You 're lucky we found this many . Whitehall , Strucker , List ... the leadership is gone , man . Usually , a head grows back , but not this time . The organization [ scoffs ] disintegrated . I want more names . [ laughs ] And I want to marry into money . Do you speak English ? No leadership means nobody giving orders , and that sure as hell includes you . Aah ! Do you understand who you work for now ? Good . I 'm done flying solo . I miss having a team around me . - I want more names . - Hail HYDRA to that . What 's the plan , sir ? Chaos ? Closure . [ clears throat ] [ dog panting ] Oh ! Hey , there , little funny face . You coming to see me today , hmm ? You come inside . We 'll get you a treat . Come on . Can I help you ? - Just passing by . Nice place . - Oh , thanks . Well , we 're just getting up and running . It 's gonna be a magical place once we get totally moved in . You know , we already have adoption days every Saturday . Tell your friends . Free spaying and neutering , too . Just ask for Dr. Winslow . I 'm sorry . And you are ... Daisy . That 's a lovely name . Remember , a house is not a home without a pet ! [ sighs ] Thank you for doing that for him . I know aspects of the Tahiti program don 't sit well with you . - This does . - He has a lot to give ... - and now a way to give it . - And what about you ? Are you ready to refocus your energies ? A team centered around people with powers ? How many on the list ? Right now , just you . We 'll take it slow . - I 've thought a lot about it . - And ? And my mother was right about one thing ... people like me need to be kept a secret , not like the Avengers , out in the open . If we do this , we need to be ... Anonymous . That 's the idea . But it 's not if we do this . We have to do this . We don 't have a choice . It may feel like things have cooled down right now , but this ... [ grunts ] This is my permanent reminder ... that we 'll always be paying the price , that we 'll never get ahead of the consequences that I , that you , that SHIELD have set in motion . - Like a ripple in the water . - But this ripple won 't fade . It 'll grow and grow until it 's a tidal wave . [ whirring ] Coulson : We 'll return in a moment ... No , I don 't . You keep rambling on and on , - and I still don 't know what you mean . - Dinner . Fast approaching , yes , and we 'll eat it , I 'm sure . Yeah , no , no , no . But , uh , me and you ... maybe we could eat somewhere else , you know , somewhere ... nice . Oh . [ snap ] Good . Okay . Uh , well , y ... uh , you should come find me when you 're finished here , and ... and I 'll ... I 'll start working on options to run by you ... for that . Ugh , what idiot ... Oh ! Aah !

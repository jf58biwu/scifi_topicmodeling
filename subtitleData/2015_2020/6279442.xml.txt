 Previously on " Defiance " ... [ boom ] I didn 't see Nolan . Someone took him . But he 's alive . I can feel him . I have chosen this human as my hiakim , my pet . [ breathing heavily ] My mother , you know where she is , don 't you ? I do not . She comes anywhere near me or my son , I 'll kill her . You 're going to help me hunt . What is that ? A control stem . [ whimpers ] What 's this thing on your neck ? Did the Omec do something to you ? Yes , they did . What 's that ? A vaccine . [ groans ] You underestimate me , Daughter . You broke my heart . [ gasps ] _ [ groans ] _ It is time to awaken and seize the world we were long ago promised . It is time for our dread harvest to begin . It doesn 't look infected . Any pain or numbness here ? I don 't think so , no . Okay , then , wiggle your piggies . Piggies are what you call toes , not fingers . Is English your first language ? - No . - Then don 't correct me . Is English your first language ? If you have to keep track , you can 't call yourself fluent . Wait , you know I don 't like needles . Then hold your ankles and think of Charles DeGaulle . [ panting ] [ metal rattling ] [ groans ] [ vehicle slowing down ] [ panting ] Yewll ! Eh ? Yeah ? [ grunting ] Yewll , please ... [ people whimpering ] Help , here . - Oh , good . - Please ? Yewll ? [ people whimpering ] Oh , yes . [ whimpers ] [ whimpers ] [ whimpers ] - [ whimpers ] - [ murmuring ] [ people whimpering ] Yewll , what in the three hells are you doing ? [ people whimpering ] [ people gasping ] Yewll ! Answer me , you shyster ! A shyster is a disreputable lawyer . I 'm a disreputable doctor . They 're controlling her , stuck an implant in her neck . She can 't help herself . Doc , this isn 't you . You have to fight back . I 've been trying . Unfortunately for all of us , I was engineered for slavery . I 'm sorry . It 's humiliating . Oh , meh , I do wish I could spare you the terrible pain of embarrassment . I 'm sorry , Datak . You don 't deserve this . [ cage door clangs ] None of you do . Deserve what ? Deserve what ? Doc ! Deserve what ? Eyes out for Kindzi . You see her , shoot to kill . Any idea what she wants ? Nope , but I do know she 's got blood on her hands , T 'evgin 's blood , and I 'm gonna make her pay . Kiddo , you 're with me . I want to circle back to the mines , see if we can pick up her tracks . Nolan , my husband is missing . We 're kind of busy right now , Stahma . I 'm afraid the Omec daughter has hurt him . What does Kindzi have against Datak ? What do you know ? She wants me dead . T 'evgin was protecting me , but now he 's disappeared . Datak went to Doctor Yewll looking for a weapon to kill an Omec , and now he 's gone as well . I know how you feel about me , Amanda . [ groans ] How you all feel . I would not come to you if I were not genuinely frightened . Stahma , T 'evgin 's dead . Are you sure ? We were there . Kindzi ? Yeah . I 'm gonna go get her now . [ sonic boom ] What the hell was that ? [ people murmuring ] There are many of them . What ? In sleep pods aboard their ship , thousands upon thousands of sleeping Omec . T 'evgin wanted them to coexist peacefully with the people of earth . With him gone , leadership will fall to Kindzi . Under her command , the Omec will attempt to conquer this planet , enslave us , ultimately consume us . - Come on . - Those meteor flashes ? I think it is just the beginning . Thousands of Omec , and you didn 't tell us ? T 'evgin threatened me . I had no choice . Bullshit ! You could have come to me . We might have had a chance to stop them before it became a full-blown invasion . If you had not invited the Omec into this town , given them our gulanite , perhaps we would not be in this position in the first place . Don 't you dare put this on me . It is the truth . [ clanging ] What are you doing with me ? [ ships rumbling overhead ] Don 't , please . [ whimpers ] Please . The sun feels good . Why am I so weak ? You 've been asleep a long time . You 'll feel better once you 've eaten . [ whimpers ] [ groans ] Don 't worry , it 'll be over soon . What will be over ? Please don 't leave me . Don 't leave me ! Please don 't leave me . [ sobs ] I have children . So do I , and they are hungry . [ growls ] - [ screams ] - [ snarling ] [ dynamic music ] ♪ ♪ Where is the All-Father ? T 'evgin was murdered . By whom ? He was betrayed by a concubine , one of the lessers , a traitor among her own people . His death must be avenged . It will be . You ? I have taken T 'evgin 's strength . I am the All-Mother now , and I will do whatever it takes to protect the Omec race . Enemies all around us . This is the curse of our people . I must grow strong . Nolan ? What do you got ? Doc Yewll . What 's she doing here ? Oh , Christ . That poor woman . You 're gonna kill Kindzi ? Yup . Doesn 't it make sense to interrogate her ? I 'll interrogate the other two . She 's got this coming . [ groans ] What the hell ? [ grunts ] [ growls ] Get back to the car ! Go ! [ gunshots ] [ growls ] I don 't understand . How could commander T 'evgin , a conqueror of many ages , be murdered by weapons such as these ? Are you calling me a liar ? Every conqueror has a limit , even T 'evgin ! The Casti whore poisoned him . He died in my arms , and I ate his heart . Any more questions ? I meant no disrespect , All-Mother . - [ snarls ] - [ grunts ] Good . I don 't understand . When we were in the mines , two bullets took her down . Maybe she 's been eating her spinach . I don 't know . I emptied my gun into her . I shot her in the head . Damnedest thing . The Gapoliraaz ritual . The what ritual ? Gapoliraaz , taking of power . I 've been studying up on my Omec history . It 's a funeral tradition . Here . When an Omec commander dies , his children eat his vital organs and gain his strength . So now Kindzi 's as strong as her father was ? Well , assuming the book 's accurate , yes . T 'evgin comes from a long line of commanders . He 's survived countless wars . So now his unhinged , unstoppable daughter is at the head of 10,000 Omec . We got to get up to that ship , cut them off at the source . [ sonic boom ] How we gonna do that , sprout wings ? I don 't know . I suggest we find a way . We have a situation ... 13 people reported missing in 24 hours . - Omec ? - No , Doc Yewll . They were all on their way to doctor 's appointments , bad tooth , broken wrist , pregnancy checkup . They never returned home . That 's why Yewll was in the field with the Omec . Wait , why would she be working with the Omec ? It makes no sense . I suggest we find her and we ask her . In the meantime , kiddo , you and Berlin do a block-to-block search . Sweep the streets . Find those missing people . You okay ? I 'm fine . There 's no way out . There 's always a way out . You know , I once spent six months locked in a cage , and that was worse because I was alone . You know who rescued me ? Joshua Nolan . I know they call him the Butcher , but ... I just think he 's amazing . Yeah , he 's swell . Yeah . Nolan rescued me once , and he 's gonna do it again . You know how I know that ? I don 't really care . I know that because of faith . Faith is a very important quality for a long-term prisoner . Faith gets you through the rough patches , and faith keeps despair far , far away . Do you suppose faith will prevent me from pissing into your cage ? Please don 't do that . - [ clang ] - [ gasps ] Anything ? Not yet . People are scared . They 're staying inside . If I see any Omec , they 're gonna be sorry they picked this town . I heard T 'evgin before he died . The rest of the Omec aren 't like Kindzi . Well , he 's wrong . You saw those Omec . They were eating a person . We don 't know what Kindzi 's telling them . Maybe there 's another way besides shooting them one by one . Like what ? Maybe we can talk to them . You 're serious . [ sighs ] Okay , well , if you can figure out how to say , " Please don 't eat me , " in Omec , let me know . You heard Nolan . Shoot to kill . We need more food . Bring out another one . You might want to keep your voice down . They key to effective mass murdering is to keep your victims in the dark as long as possible . Do not lecture me .

No ! - [ growls ] No ! Please , no ! [ screams ] You , Castithan , I recognize you . You 're Stahma 's mate . I 'm also the last person you 'll see before you die . Your meat does not seem as tender as your wife 's . [ laughs ] Surely this isn 't about meat . It 's about revenge , am I right ? Revenge against the Votan races who rose up against the Omekenefkitso and pushed you back to your home planet like a bunch of scared little bitches . And then there 's that unfortunate incident with your arks . I will not rise to bait proffered by a funny caged animal . Tell me , millions of Votans and humans inhabit the earth . How will 10,000 Omec , even with a space ship , successfully conquer them all ? And once conquered , how will you control them ? - Force . - [ laughs ] The people of earth will not surrender their planet without a fight . How many Omec fatalities will you suffer along the way ? How many can you afford to lose before your race can no longer sustain itself ? 3,000 , 4,000 ? Probably less when one factors in all the inbreeding . Aleeas , are you going to eat him ? [ growls ] I want this smug piece of white meat to understand that words have consequences . I am going now to seek out your wife . Before she dies sobbing and alone , I will let her know it was your words that killed her . Go near her , I swear you 'll suffer . The more threats you make , the emptier they sound . [ ships rumbling overhead ] [ people murmuring ] Trusted Lieutenant , go greet the new arrivals and lead them here to feed . - [ whimpers ] - Where you going , Aleeas ? To avenge our father 's death . Stay away from her ! [ screaming ] Rayetso . Doc ? Doesn 't look like she 's been here for a while . [ ships rumbling overhead ] It 's okay . No , it 's not . Come on , let 's go track her down . [ sighs ] What 's the point ? How about survival ? They keep coming , Nolan , more and more of them , and we have no way of stopping them . By my last count , there 's six plus Kindzi against the entire town . We can beat ' em . [ chuckles ] Can we ? Of course we can . Hell , it wouldn 't feel like home if we weren 't on the verge of annihilation . No , this time it 's different . This time it 's on me . [ sniffles ] [ laughs ] God , I 'm so stupid . Amanda , don 't . I believed him . We all did . Yeah , but I got on the radio and I vouched for him . I urged people not to judge him on the sins of his ancestors . I asked them to give him a chance . The stasis nets needed power , and you had to protect the town . You did not create this situation . [ scoffs ] I was warned repeatedly . Yeah , I knew we were dealing with dangerous predators . I ... I thought I knew better . I thought I could win them over , and I just opened the door to the Omec and let them come in and help themselves . If you hadn 't , Rahm Tak would have killed every human being in Defiance . Well , that would have been preferable to what the Omec have in store for our planet . [ panting ] [ sobs ] I give up . [ sobs ] When Irisa and I got back to Defiance and I saw those stasis nets down and the streets were empty , I knew this town was on the brink , and I didn 't know why . I didn 't know what had happened , but when I was climbing those stairs , I was praying one thing , one thing only , that you were still behind that desk because I knew that if you were still in charge , that Defiance had a pulse . Now , if we 're gonna beat the Omec , and we are gonna beat the Omec , then this town is gonna need our mayor . [ chuckles ] I 'm gonna need her . Thank you . Welcome .

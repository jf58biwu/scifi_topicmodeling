 Previously on The Shannara Chronicles ... EVENTINE : The Ellcrys will bear a seed that must be carried to a place called Safehold . ALLANON : In order to confront its power , you must learn to control your own . DAGDA MOR : The Druid was a fool to send you . - ( CRIES OUT ) - ALLANON : Bandon ! The window from my vision - this is how we find the Bloodfire . - ERETRIA : Are you sure ? - Positive . ( STRANGE VOICE ) Eretria ? Your body is the vessel . Your blood is the key . Don 't let them leave without you . ( GROWLS ) Proposition - your help in exchange for your freedom . AMBERLE : That mark - what does it mean ? I don 't know . I 've always had it . ANDER : Arion , my father - all gone . ALLANON : And now you are king . ALL : All hail the King . - ERETRIA : Now what ? - Now we find Safehold . ( DRAMATIC MUSIC ) ( PORTENTOUS MUSIC BUILDS ) There has to be another way across . What about that ? WIL : The yellow line . Do you see another path ? The bridge was it . WIL : Well , hope you 're a swimmer . We 're not going across . We 're going under . There 's a tunnel . Alright . It 's almost dusk . We go in there now , we 're spending the night . If there are Trolls down there ... Would you rather sleep out here in the open ? WIL : That tunnel could be flooded . ( MOMENTOUS MUSIC ) ERETRIA : Safehold . We made it . Alright . Let 's go . ( HARSH , FLEETING ECHOES ) She 's alive . Amberle 's alive . So , what did you see ? ( BANDON PANTS ) I don 't know . I saw ruins . Like an ancient city . Man-made , not Elvin . I didn 't recognise it . Was there anything else ? Think . I 'm trying . There was water . - Ocean or river ? - I don 't know . ( EXHALES HEAVILY ) I need a break . No ! The Ellcrys is almost bare . - If the last leaf falls ... - I know what happens ! If you think I am pushing you , it 's because I am trying to prepare you for what is to come . You must fortify yourself against the Dagda Mor . You 're pushing to see if I snap . It 's not fun having your mind read , is it ? Your power may be growing , but be careful how you use it , and with whom . SONG : ♪ I feel it running through my veins ♪ And I need that fire ♪ Just to know that I 'm awake . ♪ ( WIL SIGHS ) It all looks the same . - What do you think ? - l 'll head down here . You guys check that way . Double back in five minutes ? Yeah . If you run into a Troll , go for its eyes . - It 's their weak spot . - Thanks . - I should go with you . - AMBERLE : I 'll be fine . Elfstones won 't work against Trolls anyway . And killing them isn 't exactly your strong suit . I think I liked it better when you two weren 't friends . Alright . Five minutes . Not a second later . You said you were stepping down . You made a fool of me . ANDER : You need to understand , Councilwoman . I 've seen the evil that 's coming . If we hope to survive , I need you at my side . Your influence over the Council will bring unity when we need it most . Your king needs you , Kael . KAEL : You 're no king . You 're what 's left . - That went well . - ( DOOR CLOSES ) What did you expect ? I was hoping she 'd be reasonable . She believes her cause to be just . But , like all leaders , her judgement is clouded by ambition . Sounds like I should be worried . The wiser king always is . ( FAINT GROWLING ) ( GROWLING BECOMES LOUDER ) ( GROWLING CONTINUES ) Hey . I said some things back at Utopia . I was upset , and I 'm sorry - about Tye , about ... all of it . Don 't be . I was a fool . No , you weren 't . It 's OK to want to belong . I 've spent my whole life as an outcast . I know how it feels . I just wanted to believe that there was a place for me . But Tye turned out to be a liar . And Cephelo ... He saved me . The guy I spent my entire life running away from . It doesn 't make any sense . When I was a kid , my dad would come home from the tavern drunk . My mom wouldn 't let him in . He 'd just sit outside yelling and banging on the door until he passed out . I was embarrassed of him . Then I find out he 's this hero , that he destroyed himself with magic to save us all . The point is , people are complicated . You can 't beat yourself up over it . But at least you know the truth now . You know where you come from . - All I have are questions . - ( THUD , FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ) Guys , you 've got to see this . ( GROWLING ) ( AMBERLE WHISPERS ) They 're asleep . ( OMINOUS MUSIC ) No way . Is that ... My tattoo . What 's your tattoo doing on a wall beneath the ruins of a human city ? That tunnel must lead to the Bloodfire . I agree . It can 't be a coincidence . Maybe you guys didn 't notice , but there are three heavily armed Trolls in that room . - How do we get past them ? - We 've fought worse . AMBERLE : Wait . Maybe there 's another way . ( ERETRIA GRUNTS SOFTLY ) ( GRUNTS SOFTLY ) ( TROLLS GRUNT AND SNORE ) ( TENSE MUSIC ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SNORTS ) ( ERETRIA GASPS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( TROLL SNORES ) ( TROLL GRUNTS ) ( SNORES ) ( TENSE MUSIC BUILDS ) If the Gnome 's letter 's true , it could turn the tide of war . - Have you told the Council ? - No-one knows but you two . Unless I can prove an alliance with the Gnomes , the Council won 't trust me . We must tread carefully . There are forces aligning against the King . Kael intends to take the throne . If Kael 's on the move , we need to stop talking and take her out , to protect Ander . Wouldn 't do any good . Kael is a symptom . The disease is a lack of confidence . Until I can prove myself worthy of the throne , the Council won 't let me sit on it . Are you suggesting we let a coup happen ? Kael Pindanon would not dare harm the son of King Eventine . How do you know that ? Because there is still honour within these walls . This letter bears my seal - I need you to deliver it to bring back the support I need to win over the Council . I 'm not leaving you . This is my best chance to gain the Council 's trust . They need to see me as a leader . Diana , please . You 're the only one I can count on . Take it to Slanter . ( FOREBODING MUSIC ) ERETRIA : This is it . ( WARRIORS GRUNT AND SHOUT ) They 've been at it for hours . Hope they can still hold their swords when the real fighting begins . This is nothing - try spending the whole day with the Druid . Keep your shield hand high . You 'll absorb the impact with your whole body . ANDER : Our enemy is aggressive , utterly lacking in fear . They will attack with ferocity , but they will be reckless . We must be the opposite . Help rne demonstrate . BANDON : Um ... I 'm not much of a fighter . We 're all fighters in this war . DAGDA MOR : Show him your power . - ( CRY ECHOES ) - DAGDA MOR : Do n . ANDER : Be patient . Wait for an opening . DAGDA MOR : You are strong . ( WARRIOR LAUGHS ) DAGDA MOR : Take your chance . He is weak . He 's weak ! You 're stronger than you look . ( WARRIORS CHATTER INDISTINCTLY ) DAGDA MOR : He 's no king . Kill him now ! Finish him ! Slit his throat . Kill him . Do it ! Kill him ! ( CRIES OUT ) - WARRIOR : Protect the King ! - WARRIOR 2 : Restrain him ! - Put down the sword . - DADGA MOR : No ! WARRIOR : Your Highness , are you alright ? ( BANDON GRUNTS ) ANDER : Hold him . What did you see ? I don 't know . L 'm ... I 'm not sure . The boy is not himself . Let me speak with him . See that you do . Release him . ( MYSTICAL MUSIC ) AM BERLE : Looks like someone was just here . WIL : What is this place ? I feel like I 've been here before . How can that be ? I can 't explain it . ( MYSTICAL MUSIC CONTINUES ) WIL : What 's Filii Apocalypsi ? No idea . Eretria , do you recognise this language ? ( AMBERLE 'S VOICE BECOMES DISTANT ) Eretria ? Your body is the vessel . Your blood is the key . - ( GASPS AND WHIMPERS ) - You OK ? ( BREATHLESSLY ) I think so . I heard a voice . It said my blood is the key . What does that mean ? I don 't know . But I saw a place like a temple . And that symbol was there . And a light , bright , like the sun . Eretria , you saw the Bloodfire . Sounds exactly like what I saw in my vision . ( INHALES SHARPLY AND GROANS ) I know how to get to the Bloodfire . - We 're close . - How do you know that ? And what happened to you back there ? I don 't know how to explain it . It 's like I can feel the map in my blood , like it 's part of me . That 's the reason you were in my vision , why the Ellcrys wanted you here . I thought it was to make sure you didn 't get yourself killed , but ... sure , why not ? So is this what it feels like when you use your Elfstones ? What do you mean ? I feel invincible . I usually feel like I 've been set on fire or beaten with a shovel , so ... no . This should be it . Nothing ominous about that . I feel like a pawn in a game I don 't understand . Ever since I woke up , it 's like I can feel him . Who ? The Dagda Mor . It 's like he 's inside my head making me do things . Whatever that thing was , you 'll fight it , OK ? And you 'll win . What about what I want ? What do you want ? ( GROANS ) What is it ? What 's wrong ? ( GROANS ) Nothing . Nothing . I just ... ( MOANS ECHO ) I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm just ... I 'm just exhausted . Maybe you should get some rest . ( UNEASY MUSIC BUILDS ) You 're not getting away that easy . You 're not getting away at all . ( GASPS AND CRIES OUT ) Bandon . You 're hurting me ! - Bandon , stop . - ( GRUNTS ) ( COUGHS ) ( GROWLS ) Catania ! ( ETHEREAL MUSIC ) ( WIND WHISTLES SOFTLY ) AMBERLE : We made it . WIL : OK . So where is the Bloodfire ? It 's here . I can feel it . In my vision , you guys were standing beneath the window . Wil on the left . WIL : And ... Nothing . I take that back . WIL : I guess this means we 're in the right place . ERETRIA : Now what ? I don 't know . But we need to figure it out . ( MYSTERIOUS WHISPERING ) AMBERLE : Do you hear that ? ( WHISPERING CONTINUES ) ( SCREECHING ) No-one enters . - No-one leaves . - ERETRIA : Who are you ? WOMEN : Guardians of the Bloodfire . - Who among you ... - .. dares to seek ... BOTH : .. the Bloodfire ? - I do . - ( WHISPERING CONTINUES ) Amberle Elessedil of Arbolon . Hmm . Hess ... .. edil . GUARDIAN 1 : The fire has power beyond your wildest imagination . Death comes to those unfit to bathe in its essence . GUARDIAN 2 : What makes you think you 're worthy , hmm ? I was chosen . WIL : What are they telling you ? GUARDIAN 2 : You look scared , Princess . Is it because you fear the fire or because the halfling still smells of her bed ? Can you feel it ? GUARDIAN 1 : Yes , a strong magic for such weak shoulders . GUARDIAN 2 : You can 't protect her , halfling . You can 't protect yourself . GUARDIAN 2 : Your mother - dead . Your father - dead . Your heart - undecided . ( VOICES ECHO ) ( GROANS ) No . You 're trying to confuse us , turn us against each other . ( MOANS SEDUCTIVELY ) ( GUARDIAN LAUGHS ) Half human , half Elf . Which one will it be ? ( WHISPERING CONTINUES ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) What is this ? I didn 't call a meeting . Nothing you need worry about . I know what you 're doing , and you won 't get away with it . It 's already been done . Without Commander Tilton in court , the Black Watch have fallen in line . I have assurances the Council will ratify my ascension by nightfall . What you 're doing is treason . Take him . ( DRAMATIC MUSIC ) ( HORSE WHINNIES ) ( MUSIC QUIETENS ) Hello ? Show yourself . ( GUTTURAL GROWL ) That 's far enough , Commander . How did you know where to find us ? The King sent me . What does Eventine know of our plans ? Eventine 's dead . Arion too . King Ander sent me to deliver this to you . He 's assumed the throne . Not for long , it seems . I 've convinced the other tribes to fight the Demons . I wasn 't expecting an Elvin civil war . No-one was . Now will you help us ? GUARDIAN 1 : The princess saves the world . GUARDIAN 2 : The princess gets the boy . GUARDIAN 1 : The princess gets everything . GUARDIAN 2 : Happily ever after . ( GUARDIAN 2 WHISPERS ) They don 't trust you . They pity you , like a stray dog . - All alone . - ( LAUGHTER ECHOES ) Unwanted . ( LAUGHTER CONTINUES ) You don 't get to have it all . Eretria , what are you doing ? - ( LAUGHTER CONTINUES ) - Put the knife down . WIL : Don 't let them get to you . I gave up my freedom . You ? - You haven 't given up anything . - ( WHISPERING CONTINUES ) AMBERLE : All you do is take . You lie and you steal and you bat your lashes and you suck the world dry . Stop it . Don 't you see what 's happening ? They 're messing with your minds . You spoiled bitch ! You 'd be dead if it wasn 't for me . And you 'd be rotting in the bowels of a Fury ! WIL : No ! No ! ( CRIES OUT ) WIL : Eretria , I 'm sorry . ( INHALES SHARPLY AND GROANS ) GUARDIAN 2 : Now you know the truth . It 's you or them . Make your choice . ( WHISPERING CONTINUES ) Eretria . Your hand . ( ENIGMATIC MUSIC ) What 's happening to me ? She is a child of the Armageddon . My body is the vessel . My blood is the key . ( CRIES OUT ) ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) BANDON : Where is Catania ? She is safe . And that is all you need to know . You took her away . ( BANDON SIGHS ) Why ? If you truly care for her , you must let her go . DAGDA MOR : He 's lying to you ! ( GROANS ) You had no right ! Dagda Mor will exploit any weakness . And your feelings for the girl have made you vulnerable . ( SOBS ) No ! I can fight him ! DAGDA MOR : Kill him ! He 's lying to you . - ( GROANS ) - You must fortify yourself . - ( CRIES OUT ) - Fortify yourself ! ( GROWLS ) ( TROUBLING MUSIC ) You talk about my gift . You tell me I 'm important . And then you use me and toss me aside . You sent me to that thing , to my imprisonment . Demons may have killed my family , but you you 've taken everything else . Everything I have done , I have done for the safety of the Four Lands and to protect you . You 're nothing but an outcast from an order of dead men . Maybe it 's time you joined them ! ( GRUNTS ) This is not you , Bandon . No , Allanon . This is me , stronger than anyone could ever imagine . Stronger than you , even ! ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( ROARS ) ALLANON : I am sorry for everything I have done and all that is yet to come . ( DOOR CLANGS ) Who 's there ? ( STRANGE WHISPERING AND SNARLING ) Thank you . I 'm sorry about your kin . But I believe you are the ruler the Four Lands needs . I hope you 're right . How many are with you ? 5,000 , in the caves beyond the city . It 's quite a sight . SLANTER : My men await your orders King . We move tonight . Gather your men . ( ERETRIA GROANS ) ( GUARDIANS SPEAK INDISTINCTLY ) It 's the Bloodfire ! I need to get inside . We will not let you feel the power of the Bloodfire ! She 's the one ! You 're the bearer of the seed ! Run for the flame . I 'll cover you . Now go ! GUARDIAN : Don 't let her get away ! - ( GUARDIAN SHRIEKS ) - Hey ! Crazy lady ! - ( CRIES OUT ) - ( GUARDIAN SHRIEKS ) - ( SCREAMS ) - WIL : Now go ! - Go ! - ( GUARDIAN SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMS ) ( WIL SHOUTS ) Amberle ! KAEL : We must fortify the palace and prepare for a siege . - And the Sanctuary ? - The Ellcrys is beyond saving . ANDER : You 're wrong . The Ellcrys is this city 's only chance . What are those creatures doing here ? The Gnomes come in peace , to fight the Demons as our allies . They pledged an oath to the King . The true King . The Gnomes are not our enemy . The Dagda Mor is . And he will not cease until every race of the Four Lands is destroyed . We don 't need to face this alone . With the Gnomes ' help , we can protect the Sanctuary until Amberle returns ... Madness ! The princess is likely dead already . She lives . And when she returns with the seed , we shall restore the Forbidding . That is the only way to win this war . Forgive us , Your Grace . BLACK WATCH : Forgive us , Your Grace . BLACK WATCH SOLDIER : All hail King Ander . BLACK WATCH : All hail King Ander . ANDER : If we fall we fall together . ( GROANS ) Amberle ? Amberle ! Eretria . We have to get her out of there . Eretria ? Come on . Hey . Come on . Hey . Wake up . ( SOMBRE MUSIC ) ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( DEMONS ROAR AND SHRIEK ) ( ROARS ) ( MOMENTOUS MUSIC ) ( ROARING )

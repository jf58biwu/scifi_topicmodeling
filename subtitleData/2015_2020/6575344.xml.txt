 Previously on " the 100 " ... You left me no choice . Pike : Marcus Kane , for the crime of treason , I hereby sentence you to death . Aden is the most promising of my novitiates . If I should die today , he will likely succeed me . I won 't just sit there and watch you die . If you 're right , today 's the day my spirit will choose its successor . I thought you said there were 9 novitiates at your conclave . What happened to number 8 ? I 'm sorry it had to come to this , Clarke . What is that ? It 's the spirit of the commander . The conclave must be starting . Cool . You see anything ? Oh , come on . What ? Bunch of grounders fighting to the death to see who gets the a.I. Drilled in their brain , that doesn 't sound fun to you ? Murphy : Hey ... Clarke ... I 'm sorry . I know how much she meant to you . This has nothing to do with me . We need to make sure that Aden wins . What , you come here to finish the job ? No . I 'm here to fulfill my vow to lexa . Put these on . Look . The door we were banging on for the last 24 hours is open . Let 's use it . Clarke : You killed your commander . How are you still free ? I 'm the only fleimkepa . Now please , if you go now , you can slip in with the crowds arriving for tomorrow 's conclave . You heard the man . All right . Let 's- - I need to see Aden first . That 's out of the question . The natblidas have begun the purification ritual . That sounds kind of private , Clarke . Where ? They 're just kids . I 'm sorry to disturb you . Would you like a moment with her ? No . I 'm here to see you . You made me a promise to support my people . If heda 's spirit chooses me . Yes . Will you still ? We all will . Lexa made each of us vow it . We loved her . Roan : Out of our way . You . Aah ! Aah ! Rrr ! No . Roan : Put the knife down , ontari . Your mother is dead because of her . You will obey your king . An unfortunate fact we have her to thank for , as well . No matter . When I am heda and the king bows to me , you and every last member of skaikru will die . Hey ... You inspire them . I 'm not gonna let you give up , either . Man : Chancellor on deck . I thought i had more time . I 'm not here for you . Each of you is guilty of the same crimes as Kane , and as such , you will share the same fate--death . My people are innocent . They know nothing . Don 't let them suffer for my crimes , please , sir . Lincoln 's right . All the others did was run through an open door , same thing we would do if we were in there . I believe that 's true . Kane , Lincoln , sinclair , as the leaders of this coup , you will pay for your crimes with your lives . Execution is set for dawn . What do you want ? - What do- - - shh . Whoa , whoa , hey . It 's ok . Harper : Huh . The bag blocks the signal . Now we can talk . Who put it in there ? Bellamy : That 's not important right now . Pike just sentenced Lincoln and sinclair to death alongside Kane . Hmm , are you trying to scare us ? No . We 're here to help . I 'm sure you have a plan to break them out . What can we do ? What are you talking about ? Harper , come on . Look . We can help from the inside . To pull this off , we need people to hand them off to on the outside . We seriously don 't know what you 're talking about . You think we want them to die ? You know what ? Forget it . If my sister wants to save Lincoln 's life , you tell her to meet me at the dropship in an hour . Bellamy- - after everything we 've been through , you don 't trust me ? Does your mom know you 're here , monty ? Glad you came . I 'm alone , o . I 'm here to help . Sleep well , big brother . You do not belong here . Really ? Why is my blood decorating your floor ? There 's nothing left for you in polls . Why have you not gone ? Yeah . That 's what I 'd like to know . We need to talk about ontari . She wasn 't trained here . Why would you let her into the conclave ? Ontari has the blood of the commanders . It is her birthright to compete for the flame . Is she really in there ? Of course she is . Murphy : What does it matter who wins , huh ? I mean , listen to me . If your girlfriend really is in that thing , then we have nothing to worry about , right ? Clarke , let 's just get out of here while we can . It matters . I 've served 4 commanders as fleimkepa , none of them half as wise or strong as lexa kom trikru . The truth is , she was all those things even before ascension . The flame deepens what 's already there . If the spirit of the commander should choose ontari , the ice nation will control everything , and skaikru will face her wrath . Not really a silver-lining type of guy , is he ? So how do we make sure Aden wins ? He was lexa 's choice . You know that . And she will choose him . What 's that ? The victory horn . What 's going on ? Shh . What is the meaning of this ? Aden . If she sees you , she 'll have your head , too . Clarke , I think we should get out of here . I win . Bellamy : Oh ... It was a mistake to bring him here . He was out the whole way , and I searched him for bugs . You think I 'd let them hurt you ? Indra : Shut your mouth . Indra , we talked about this . You waste time . You should be in their camp by now . No . It 's suicide . Pike will be expecting you . You won 't get close . I can . We can save them , but we have to work together . You 're the reason they need saving . Maybe , but that doesn 't change the fact that you need me . For the first time in my life , that 's not true . O.- - o . Hey , I got your message . What 's wrong ? I , um , have a confession to make . I 'm a spy , Bryan . I 've been passing information for- - hey , shut up . Found the bug . You put it there ? You ? Why were you so afraid of what I might say , Bryan ? We execute traitors now . Yeah . We do . You have a problem with that ? - Nate , i- - - what , to pike ? I know . He saved your life out there . - You owe him . - Ok , but I love you . Yeah . Well , you can 't have both of us . Chase : You can thank chancellor pike for this . You 've got 5 minutes . Are you all right ? I won 't let this happen to you . Abby , listen . Anyone caught helping us will be condemned to death , too . Then I won 't get caught . Look . I 'm begging you- - I 'm begging you , just don 't--don 't do it . Our people need someone here to show them a way out of the dark . I can 't do this again . Don 't make this any harder than it already is . Guard . Clarke : Slow down , roan . We need to talk to Titus . Roan : Trust me , right now your friend Titus is on his knees in front of ontari . No . There 's no way that he 'll support someone who hacked the heads off children while they slept . Yeah . Those children were marked for death , anyway . You 'll support her , too , she 's ice nation . Whatever 's best for your people , is that it ? That 's it , kind of like killing every man , woman , and child in mount weather was best for yours . That 's not a bad point . Shut up , Murphy . Tunnel 's through here . Ok . Great . Thank you . Saved your life again . My debt to lexa for sparing mine 's now paid . Next time you see me won 't be as friends . We are not leaving , are we ? Not without the flame . Could 've worked . Death can be an act of unity , too . We don 't break . We don 't show fear . The people will remember . - Chancellor on deck . - It 's time . Pike : Ok . Open the door . Back up . Back up . Against the wall now . Come on . Let 's go . Go . Go . Make way . Yes , sir , Mr. chancellor . Let 's go . Come on . Package is on the move . I repeat , package is on the move . We are a go . She 's talking about the prisoners . Whose voice was that ? Harper : Oks , is your team in position ? Oks . Octavia , on radio : Roger that . We 're in position and ready to intercept . Octavia kom skaikru . Sir , you were right . Octavia Blake is here , and she 's not alone . On their knees . Can you confirm a location ? Hannah : Negative , sir . Bryan : Sir , we can assume her friends have already told her where we 're taking them . We shouldn 't go any further till we know the route 's secure . Pike : Put them in there . Let 's go ! Move . Come on . Let 's go . - Move it . - Come on . Uh ! I want two men on the door . - We got it . - Good . Anyone comes out of there , shoot to kill . Anyone enters this corridor , one warning , then shoot to kill . Everyone else on me . Indra , please , she has no idea what she 's facing in there . Pike has tripled his security . There 's surveillance everywhere . He 'll see her coming . Good . We 're counting on that . He still trusts me . If anything goes wrong , we can use that . I saw where you earned that trust , on the battlefield , where you massacred my brothers and sisters . Should I have let pike kill you ? Why didn 't you ? Same reason you haven 't used that sword on me . Octavia . We are running out of time . Cut me loose . She could die in there . Then octavia kom skaikru will earn the warrior 's death you denied me . Uh ! Rrgh ! Uh ! Have I mentioned that I hate this idea ? We can 't let ontari get the flame . Clarke : Come on . He keeps it in the pod . Just stay there . I 'll be quick . You killed her . I pulled the trigger , but it was you . Titus ... You made lexa a promise , remember ? Give me the kit . I know you don 't want ontari to get the flame . She murdered those kids , children you raised . Lexa 's spirit would never choose - to do something like that . - Yes , she did . You don 't believe that . I have to . Ontari kom azgeda is the last natblida . Then put the damn thing in someone else . You stupid girl , after all you 've witnessed here , you still think this is just superstition . When someone without the blood takes the flame , the flame takes their life . I don 't understand . If nightblood is so rare , then why do you let them kill each other ? That has to be the dumbest succession plan I 've- - we honor those who die in the conclave . What ? Wait . The eighth circle . Lexa had markings on her back for every life she took at her conclave , 7 circles , only she told me that there were 8 novitiates in her class . What happened to number 8 ? There 's another natblida , isn 't there ? Yes . She fled , a coward and a traitor to the blood . Lexa refused to let me hunt her down . She 's unworthy of the flame . More unworthy than ontari ? Murphy : Hey , hey , just--hey ! Ontari : Uh ! She 's here . Uh ... Hide . Ontari : How dare you bring skaikru into the order of the flame ? It 's what lexa wanted . Well , lexa 's not heda anymore , thanks to you . Let 's get this over with . You must be cleansed before you ascend . Take her to the commander 's chambers . Perform the ritual . Are you sure I 'm ready for that ? Thank you . Even Luna would be better than her . Did you just say Luna ? Yes . You heard the name before ? From my friend Lincoln . Can he find her ? Then perhaps the spirit hasn 't chosen , after all . I 'll take you to him . Luna will never allow me near her . This is yours now . I 'll protect it with my life . There 's a book inside . It 's the journal of the first commander . When you find Luna , you 'll need it to perform the ascension ritual . Come . Armor of past commanders . Choose something . Take the hidden passage . The tunnel will lead you to the stable . They 're expecting you . - What about Murphy ? - I 'll get him out . Your duty is to the flame now ... Fleimkepa . Same drill . Sweep in pairs . Watch your blind spots . Man : Sir . Cover every corner . Clear . Chase : Sir , the hangar bay is secure . They 're not here . Something 's not right . Unit 4 , what 's your status ? Are the prisoners secure ? Unit 4 . Let 's go . Watch the doors . Check them and call medical . Yes , sir . Medical , two guards down , Alpha station corridor , need assistance there now . Damn ! The guys are alive , sir . They must have drugged them . We did what they wanted us to do . That won 't happen again . All clear . Come on . Let 's go . Uh ... It 's a little bit tight in there . Try doing it for 16 years . Hey , we 'll come back for danae and the others , I promise . Hey , hey , you ok ? I told you not to do this . Why would I start listening to you now ? Octavia : Hey- - Harper , on radio : Oks , come in . - What is it ? - This wasn 't the plan . We use their frequency so they could hear us . Go ahead . Stay where you are . Man , on radio : Left corridor clear . Repeat , stay where you are . The exit is not clear . How many guards ? Too many . I said , stay put . They 're trapped . Uh ! Man : Area clear . Calling all guards . The prisoners are headed for the main gate . The prisoners are headed for the main gate . Over . Monty , what are you doing ? Saving my friends . Move , move , move . We 're on our way there now . That was monty . Guess he 's with us after all . Pike will find out . Abby : We don 't know that . What we do know is , we have to move . Your friends are traitors . Then I guess I 'm one , too . How many men to we have at the main gate ? Sir , we just got word that was another false report . Man , on radio : Team two , we 're at the main gate . There 's nothing here . Different man , on radio : Yeah . 10-4 . We 're on it . Negative here . Lock this camp down . We 're going door to door . Go . In the meantime , let 's see if we can 't bring them to us . Kane : Go , go , go . Go . Come on . Woman , on P.A. : Attention , all citizens . Emergency lockdown is in effect . Return to your quarters immediately . Ok , Abby . Come on . You 're next . I 'm not going . They need someone to show them the way out of the dark . Besides , i- - may we meet again . We will . Pike , on radio : I have a message for the traitors in this camp . There will be an execution today . Either turn yourselves in , or the other grounder prisoners will die in your place . Let 's go . No . Wait . I can 't let them die because of me . Lincoln , please . We 're almost out . I know what you 're feeling , but they 're searching the station . We need to go now . You should . Fine . I 'm going with you . I love you . No . Uh ... What are you doing ? Same thing you 'd do for your people . Just get her out of here . You , too . Freeze ! How much longer ? Purification is a process . You 're not afraid of me . I don 't scare easily . The truth is , I think what you did was smart , a little crazy maybe , but we do what we have to do to survive , right ? You know I plan to wipe out your people . So I 've heard . Sucks for them . What is this ? The flamekeeper claims he lost the flame . You , where 's wanheda ? How would I know ? Don 't play games with me . I know she stole the flame . - Where is she ? - She didn 't steal it . I gave it to her . Where 's she taking it ? You mission is to pass the flame . You wouldn 't give it to her without a natblida to pass it to . Murphy : You can 't kill him . He 's the only one who can perform the ritual . Titus : This abomination will never ascend . Kill him . He 's right . We need him . For lexa . Announce my ascension . You don 't have the flame , ontari . Don 't talk to me as if I 'm a fool , roan . No one knows that . He does . He happens to like his head . Light the pyre . Burn the bitch who killed your mother . Let the people know they have a new commander and find wanheda . That 's an order . Heda . No . What is it ? A new commander has risen . You go running , just like mount weather , huh ? Maybe this time , octavia will get it . Your loyalty will always be with your people . Octavia is my people . Then take these chains off me , and we can help her together . Tell her I 'm sorry . Lincoln .

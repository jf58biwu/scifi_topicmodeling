 [ NARRATOR ] Previously on Dark Matter . You saw the scans . Yeah , and they said you 're flesh and blood . Artificially constructed . Welcome back , Rebecca . [ TWO grunts ] [ SIX ] We 're gonna go get her . [ FIVE ] I knew you weren 't serious about leaving her behind . [ saw buzzing ] [ grunts ] [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] Do they know what she is ? Yes . [ MYSTERIOUS MAN ] Then they 'll need to die too , Alex . All of them . [ PORTIA ] so ? [ RYO ] You 're right . [ PORTIA ] Then we 're agreed ? [ RYO ] Yes . [ PORTIA ] He has to die . [ RYO ] When ? [ PORTIA ] Before we get to the mining colony , after we come out of stasis . [ FIVE ] Hey , Android , there 's something I need to talk to you about ... [ FIVE ] Hey . Hey ! Hey , help ! Somebody help ! Somebody help ! Help ! [ TWO ] What 's the matter ? [ FIVE ] The Android 's offline . Her neural chip 's been removed . There 's something in her hand . Volkov-Rusi . The soldiers who took the ship . We didn 't get them all . [ THREE ] Son-of-a-bitch . No one messes with my robot . Whoever took her down removed her neural implant . We 're gonna need to recover it to bring her back online . [ FOUR ] Assuming it already hasn 't been destroyed . I don 't think so . With the implant , you could do a full reboot to make her more manageable . Control the Android and you control the ship . So why didn 't whoever it was do it already ? Why wait ? [ TWO ] I don 't know . Maybe they weren 't thinking straight , or Five scared them off . Or maybe they have some other agenda . [ ONE ] But how is this possible ? We did a full top to bottom sweep . Obviously we need to do a better one this time . Right . But remember , we need to keep them alive . At least until we get the implant back . You know how to use it . Yeah . One , you 're with Four . Five , you 're with Six . Three , you 're with me . Keep your eyes on your partner and stay in touch . [ THREE ] You know I 'm kinda surprised you didn 't partner up with your boy . You two having issues ? No , not that it 's any of your business . Sweetheart , on this ship , everything is everyone 's business . Outside of our quarters , he 's just another member of this crew . Yeah , I remember the drill . I wanted to ask you something . Yeah ? When I was in that airlock and they were threatening to space me , you were the one who gave up the code . So ? Even though I told you not to . Is this where you give me the gears for disobeying an order ? That 's not at all what I was trying to say . You 're the most convenient choice to command this ship . Don 't let it go to your head . [ TWO ] Actually , I was trying to thank you . Oh . [ TWO ] Until you ruined it . Well , you 're welcome . Clear . So Why 'd you do it ? [ TWO ] Hmm ? Why did you do it ? I don 't know . Guess I just figured ... you 're a valuable asset is all . Anyway , you 're worth much more than the payoff from one job . So it was a calculated decision based strictly on logic ? Sounds like me , right ? Sure . [ ONE ] Just to be clear , we 're trying to take whoever did this alive , remember ? You doubting my self-control ? I 'm disciplined . I only kill when necessary . Yeah , like your old friend ? Akita ? He was a threat . [ beep ] Yeah ? He would have come after me eventually . A dead enemy is one less concern . I don 't know . Enemy or not , the lives I 've taken weigh pretty heavily on me . Yeah , well I can 't allow them to affect me , because I have so many more to take . We 're less than a week out from the edge of colonized space , out of the reach of the Galactic Authority . We can afford to stop running . Look , unlike you , I 'm not trying to escape my past . I 've chosen to embrace it . [ pad beeps ] So once I 've gathered all the necessary resources , I 'll return to Zairon and retake my throne . [ TWO ] One , come in . What 's your status ? [ ONE ] Yeah , we just cleared this section . What ? You look pretty comfortable with that gun . Four 's been teaching me self-defense . That includes fighting and ... weapon training . Now , when there 's trouble , instead of hiding I can finally be useful . You 've never needed a gun to be useful . You might not want to hear it , but ... I 'm happy now . I finally feel like I 'm part of the team and it 's got nothing to do with this gun . Well , here 's the irony . All this time you 've been trying to be more like us , we 've actually been trying to be more like you . And we failed . In the end , we can 't help but be who we are . That 's not true . When we woke up we were just a group of strangers . But now ... we 're a family . [ TWO ] Six , how 're you two doing ? [ SIX ] All clear here , too . [ TWO ] Okay . Fall back to the bridge . Could it be that there are parts of this ship that we have yet to discover ? I was considering the possibility . But we haven 't finished searching . What 're you talking about ? We 've looked everywhere . No , we haven 't . [ SIX ] You got guts , I 'll give you that . I know these vents . If there 's someone in here , I 'll find them . [ FIVE ] Ready . Turning on the live feed . [ FIVE pants ] Receiving . Okay , we 're gonna go through this level by level . The others are all stationed at choke points , so there will always be someone there if you run into any trouble . If you encounter anyone , I don 't want you to take any chances , you understand ? I won 't . All right , One , she 's approaching your position . [ ONE ] Yeah , I see her . This area 's clear . I 'm moving on . This level 's clear , too . [ crashing ] [ THREE ] Shh ! She 's approaching the final position . If anyone 's in there , that 's where they 'll be . [ THREE ] It 's always the last place you look . [ ONE whispers ] Shut that off . All clear . [ ONE sighs ] There 's no one here . [ THREE ] Great . Now what ? I 'm coming down . [ THREE ] What ? You think someone 's in there ? [ TWO ] No , I don 't . [ TWO ] Shit ... [ ONE ] What ? This case contained the stun device Wexler used to take down the Android , and now it 's gone . We 're the only ones with the code to this room . There 's no one else onboard this ship . It was one of us . [ ONE ] You sure that 's where we put it ? [ TWO ] The device was there yesterday . [ ONE ] Why would one of us target the Android ? [ TWO ] Because she poses the greatest threat . With her out of the way , it 's a whole lot easier to take the rest of us down . [ ONE ] Take us down ? Why ? To finish what was started the day our memories were wiped . But , why now ? What 's changed ? [ ONE ] I don 't know . But we 've got to figure this out , fast . [ TWO ] There is one way . We 're two days out from the nearest space station . We get there , get a new implant , and bring the Android back online . And have another lie detector session . No , whoever did this is not gonna wait another two days . [ FOUR ] Of course not . The next move will be made before then . [ SIX ] Where are you going ? If anyone needs me , I 'll be training . [ SIX ] We should stick together . Separated , we 're easier targets . I 'd welcome anyone who considered me an easy target . [ THREE chuckles ] What 'd you think we were gonna do ? We 're gonna bunk together , all six of us ? Nah , man . I say he 's right . I say bring it on . Speaking of which , can we take a little walk ? Got something to discuss . Sure . [ ONE ] Hey , remember , we don 't know who to trust so ... be careful . [ THREE ] I will ! [ THREE ] Question : [ THREE ] How attached are you to that guy ? I just want to know what kind of blowback I 'm gonna get when we leave him at the next space station . You 've got him all figured out now , don 't you ? Had him figured out weeks ago . He lied to get onboard this ship . God knows why or who he really even is . I know why and who he really is . He told me . Is that something you thought you might wanna share with me and the rest of the crew ? It 's nothing the rest of the crew has to worry about . Oh , okay . Good to know . Or not . And it 's nothing that would motivate him to take down our Android . As far as you know . That would apply to everyone else on this ship . Sure , but you 're not sleeping with everyone else on this ship . Are you suggesting my ability to lead has somehow been compromised ? Four 's right . Whatever One 's got planned , he 's gonna do it before we get to the next station , so what I am suggesting is that we lock him up until we get there . Better yet , why don 't I put you all in lockdown , just to be on the safe side ? Problem with that is then you 'd have total control of the ship . I thought it was him you didn 't trust ? Nah , it 's just him I trust the least . [ TWO ] I 'll take your request under advisement . Yeah , well , don 't take too long . 'Cause if you don 't do something about him , I sure as hell will . [ FOUR pants ] [ FOUR ] A rare visit from you . Should I be worried ? Yes , you should be , but not about me . I 've been raising the alarm about Three from the very beginning . [ FOUR ] That you have . Come on . You 've displayed some pretty remarkable intuition . What do your instincts tell you ? To trust no one , least of all someone who snuck aboard this ship under false pretenses . I 'm not like the rest of you . Clearly . When we used the transfer pods to go looking for Six , I ran a genetic scan and found out the truth . My real name is Derrick Moss . I was a business man , and by all accounts leading a privileged life , until my wife was murdered . By a member of this crew . Care to guess which one ? So it 's revenge you 're after . I thought so . [ ONE ] Now , I don 't know . I had a chance to kill him , and I didn 't . I 'm sure another opportunity will present itself . I 'm not looking for payback . I just want to keep us safe , and the only way of doing that is by making sure he 's no longer a threat . I 'm not saying we kill him . Just neutralize him . Lock him up until we get to the space station so he can 't hurt anyone . There 's one more crew member you 'll have to get onside for that to happen . I know . But if she agrees , will we be able to count on your support ? You should be careful . She 'll probably come after you next . You or Four . She ? [ FIVE ] One and Three will be too busy worrying about each other . She 'll count on that . And I 'm not a threat to her , so you need to be careful . You 're talking about Two . We don 't know what happened to her while she was down on that planet . [ SIX ] Come on . You really think she 's capable of harming a member of this crew ? I know she is . I 've been thinking ... We should lock up the weapons . That 's not gonna happen . [ TWO ] Just as a precaution , until we get to the space station and figure this all out . I think the Android should be our bigger concern . [ FIVE ] He 's right . Whoever has her neural chip can use her against us . You remember what happened the last time you guys faced off against her ? Yeah , I remember , all right . Okay . So let 's say that we do agree to lock up the Android , One problem : Who holds the key ? [ ONE ] I don 't think it matters , because I 'm guessing whoever did this doesn 't have the skill set to reprogram her . I wanna come over there and demonstrate my skill set On you pretty boy , huh ? [ TWO ] Hey , hey , that 's enough . That 's enough . No , thanks . [ SIX ] Like I said before , we should all stick together , just to be safe . Huddle for protection like a bunch of frightened animals ? No , thank you . Staying together makes it harder to access the Android and use her against us . [ FOUR ] I don 't fear the Android , and I surely don 't fear any of you , so if anyone in here is even considering coming after me , I 'd suggest you rethink y- - [ Two ] You okay ? What 's happening to him ? ! [ TWO ] Blood pressure , heart , and respiratory rates are steady ; cerebral blood flow is normal , but he 's in an unresponsive state . I 'm assuming this isn 't something you just sleep off ? It 's impossible to say . I don 't know what he ingested but my guess is it was a rapid-onset , ultra short-action barbiturate . Possibly a neurotoxin . So our entire water supply 's been laced ? We can 't know for sure until I run a full analysis . Until then , I 'd advise everyone to not consume anything that isn 't sealed . A few minutes later , we all would 've joined him . Not all of us . One of us didn 't take any water . One of us wasn 't thirsty . Isn 't that convenient ? [ ONE ] Oh , come on . If I wanted to drug you , I would 've taken a cup like the rest of you so you wouldn 't suspect me . Unless , of course , you thought that we wouldn 't be awake to suspect you . I 'm smart enough not to take that chance . And yet , you did . No , I didn 't , because I didn 't drug the water ! All right , settle down . You 're not gonna get anywhere arguing . That 's because you guys aren 't listening to me . [ TWO ] You 're just throwing around wild accusations . You want proof ? Fine , let 's get proof . Search his quarters . Guaranteed , that 's where we 're gonna find the shock stick . Come on , who 's stupid enough to hide that thing in their room ? I wanna search his quarters , too ! [ TWO ] Fine . We 'll search everyone 's quarters . [ THREE ] Great . I don 't even know what half of this stuff is . [ FIVE ] Neither do I until I fix it . [ SIX ] All right , we done here ? Yeah . That 's a little something I picked up at the last space station ... From a little something I picked up at the last space station . [ TWO ] Uh-huh . Moving on . We done here ? Okay , we 're done . It 's late . We 're tired . Get some sleep . No one 's gonna keep an eye on him ? Be my guest . [ SIX ] Night . [ TWO ] All right . Rest up . I have a feeling tomorrow 's gonna be a really long day . You okay ? Yeah . Goodnight . Goodnight . [ FIVE ] You think you could stay in my quarters tonight ? You can take the bed , I 'll sleep on the couch . I 'll stay on the couch . Why does she scare you so bad ? [ PORTIA ] so ? [ RYO ] You 're right . [ PORTIA ] Then we 're agreed ? [ RYO ] Yes . [ PORTIA ] He has to die . [ RYO ] When ? [ PORTIA ] Before we get to the mining colony , after we come out of stasis . Where 'd you find this ? In the mess , underneath the table . She was planning to kill one of you before we got to that mining planet . She 's the dangerous one . Have you ever checked your computer for hidden or deleted files ? O-Of course . That 's one of the first things I did . What did you find ? A couple of corrupted files , I couldn 't read them . You don 't need to read them . You just need to check the time stamp . Evening . Going somewhere ? Yeah , I was just going to the mess . Great . I 'll join you . On second thought , I think I 'll turn in . [ THREE ] Suit yourself . But if you change your mind , you know where I am . Right here . Wait , there it is . That file was created the day we went into stasis . So what are you saying ? That 's the program you wrote that wiped all our memories . No . But I don 't think that was your intention . Like the Android said , it was crude . You didn 't have enough time . No ! Yes . It was you , but I don 't think you were trying to hurt anyone . Then why ? I think you were trying to protect someone . [ thud ] What 's the matter ? I thought I heard something . [ FIVE ] What do you mean ? What 'd you hear ? All right , lock the door after me . Don 't go out there ! I 'll be fine . And so will you . I promise . [ keypad beeps ] Six ? [ FIVE ] Six ? ! [ FIVE screams ] [ FIVE screams ] [ FIVE ] Help ! [ ONE ] What was that ? [ THREE ] I don 't know . [ TWO ] Brain activity is minimal . He 's in a deep coma . [ FIVE ] Like Four ? [ TWO ] Yes . I think the same agent was used to incapacitate him . He have anything to eat or drink ? That 's not how it was administered . He was injected . So someone had to get close enough to him to do it . Meaning it was someone he trusted . That sure as hell ain 't me . Seriously ? - - [ crash ] - - [ ONE ] Whoa ! What the hell was that ? ! [ alarm sounds ] What 's the story ? The engines are down , both FTL and sublight . That can 't be an accident . [ TWO ] I 'm guessing not . [ THREE ] Hey , where the hell is One ? [ TWO ] What ? One , where are you ? One , please respond ! [ THREE ] Goddamnit ! We can 't have him wandering loose around the ship . There 's no telling what damage he 's gonna do . [ THREE ] Better safe than sorry . [ TWO ] Hey , I 'm sealing you in . Don 't open up for anyone . [ THREE ] If someone comes through that door who ain 't us you shoot ' em . [ keypad beeps ] [ keypad beeps ] [ ONE ] Don 't move . [ THREE ] Thought you were lost . Came looking for you . So you could put a bullet in my head ? No , just looking to keep you out of trouble . By setting me up ? You know it 's just you and me here , right ? You can stop pretending . What was that explosion ? Why don 't you do me a favor and drop the act . What was that explosion ? Someone targeted the engines . It wasn 't me . Really ? I wonder who it was ... The kid ? I don 't know . Why don 't you just knock it off ? All right ? The game is over . You 're in no position to be making that call . [ ONE yelpS ] Maybe not . But I was in the perfect position to see that coming . Thanks . Ahh ! You 're making a mistake . It wasn 't me . Like hell it wasn 't . What 'd you do with Five ? Five 's fine . She 's waiting for us on the bridge . [ keypad beeps ] Five , this is Two . We found him . Is he all right ? [ TWO ] Yeah , he 's fine . Three and I are headed down to the lower levels to assess the damage to the engines . [ keypad beeps ] [ doors creak ] [ ONE ] Five ? Five , I know you can hear me . Are you okay ? [ ONE ] I 'm fine , for now ... but it 's only a matter of time before he comes back and finishes the job . He 's been gunning for me since day one and now that he 's got Two onside , he can finally do it . They 've locked me up inside my quarters . I need you to come let me out . L-I don 't know ... [ ONE ] If you don 't get me out of here , I 'm as good as dead . They 've got me locked inside the bridge . Well ... find a way out . I know you can . [ ANDROID SIMULATION ] This ship is damaged and requires immediate attention . You 're back online ! You 're not our android . [ ANDROID SIMULATION ] No . I 'm merely a projection , a simulation based on your android 's default settings . I was programmed to interact with this ship 's crew in the event your android becomes incapacitated . You 're her backup ? I can serve that function , to a limited capacity , but I was originally created to observe , record , and offer deductive , dispassionate advice . About what ? About your android 's increasingly irregular behavior . She 's concerned , and rightly so . What do you mean ? I was waiting to inform her of the results of my comprehensive diagnostics . As she suspected , there is a glitch in her personality matrix related to her emotional subroutines . She is defective . I like her just fine the way she is . A predictably adolescent response . She 'll be less problematic once she 's been restored to her factory settings . I need you to do something for me . Of course- - Shut the hell up . And open that door . I can 't . I 'm a member of this crew . You have to follow my orders . True , but I 'm not neurally linked to this ship . It 's not that I 'm unwilling to help you , I 'm merely incapable of doing so . Okay then , here 's something you can do for me . Erase all memory stores related to your recent diagnostics , and then delete your active programming . But then I would cease to exist . Yeah , that 's the idea . Very well . I can find my own way out of here . [ console hum dies ] [ TWO ] Five , I 've redirected power away from the damaged section . Are the sublight engines back online ? Five , do you read ? [ THREE ] Ugh . [ THREE ] Dammit . [ TWO ] Good , sublight engines are back online . What about FTL ? [ alarm beeping ] What ? Long range sensors just picked up a ship headed straight for us . What kind of ship ? Galactic Authority . - -How the hell did they find us ? - -How do you think ? Somebody must 've sent a subspace transmission and tipped them off . What are our options ? With the FTL drive down , our only option is to fight . Can we take ' em ? [ TWO ] I can 't access weapons . We 're locked out . How is that possible ? It 's been passcode protected . Crack the code ! I don 't think I can . Five , where are you ? Five , we need you on the bridge , come in . Son-of-a-bitch . What 're you going to do ? ! [ THREE ] I 'm gonna go get that passcode . [ TWO ] Wait ! [ THREE ] What the- - Here we are again . Congratulations . Your pals are on their way . My Pals ? [ THREE ] The Galactic Authority . What are you talking about ? [ THREE ] We picked them up on our long range scanners . They are headed our way . What ? ! Why do you even bother acting surprised ? [ ONE ] Because , you idiot , it wasn 't me . It 's never been me . [ THREE ] You may not give a damn about anyone else in this ship , but I know you still have feelings for Two , so what do you thinks gonna happen when they take the ship , huh ? She 's illegal tech . They 're gonna tear her apart , piece by piece . Can you live with that ? Give us the passcode . Give us a fighting chance . What are you talking about ? What passcode ? Drop it . I said drop it . So he can torture me for information I don 't have ? I don 't think so . He 's not going to torture you . I won 't let him . Really ? Because it looks like you were about to . Lower your gun . You kill me now or he kills me later . Not much of a choice . What 're you doing ? Stopping you from hurting anyone else . Seriously , kid . [ FIVE ] She 's the one who poured us the drugged water . She was the last one who saw that shock stick in the vault . Drop your gun . [ FIVE ] All this time we 've been wondering why whoever did this hasn 't brought the Android online and taken control of the ship . The answer 's been in front of us all along . There 's only one person who wouldn 't need to do that . Somebody who already knows how to control the ship . I 'm not the only one who knows how to control this ship . [ FIVE ] No , but you 're the only one capable of overpowering Six . [ TWO ] Nobody overpowered Six , he was surprised by someone he trusted . [ FIVE ] No , because the truth is , he didn 't trust anyone . Except you . [ FIVE ] All this started when we rescued her from that facility . Something happened to her down there . And when she came back to the ship , the first thing she did was attack our Android . [ TWO ] No , no . No ! [ FIVE ] If you two hadn 't been too busy suspecting each other , you might 've seen it . But ... she played you both . [ crashing ] What was that ? ! We 've just been docked . [ TWO ] We 've got about 40 seconds before they blow the airlock and they 're inside . That buys us enough time to get down into the cargo bay , break out the big guns , and hold this ship . But we have to trust each other in order to do that . [ THREE ] What the hell ? ! [ screaming ] [ ALL coughing ] Ugh ! [ electricity zapping ]

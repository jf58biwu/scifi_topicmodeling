 They say that history is written by the Victors . This , then , is the history of the umbrella corporation , formed by crusading scientist professor James Marcus . Marcus had a young daughter , Alicia , afflicted with progeria , a progressive , fatal , wasting disease . Progeria caused premature aging . By the time she was 25 , Alicia would have the body of a 90-year-old . Marcus was driven to save her , but the odds seemed impossible . And even as he worked desperately to create a cure , the young girl 's father would record his daughter , her voice , her likeness , saving her for posterity . But then the breakthrough came . Marcus discovered the t-virus . Once injected , it would detect and repair damaged cells within the body . It was a miracle . The life of Alicia Marcus was saved . The t-virus had a myriad of applications , treating 1,000 different diseases . Overnight , it seemed a new era was dawning , a world without the fear of infection , sickness or decay . But it was not to be , for the t-virus had certain unforeseen side effects . Sir , sir , over here ! Hey . He 's not breathing . The first of the undead was born . The incident was quickly covered up . In the aftermath , James Marcus argued furiously with his business partner , Dr. Alexander Isaacs . I don 't care how much it costs , we have to close the program down . James , we 're gonna be ruined . My mind is made up . Pity . Off to bed , Alicia . Your father and I are just talking . Go on . Dr. Isaacs became the guardian of his dead partner 's child and her half of the company . The corporation that had begun with such lofty ideals had been seduced completely by greed and power . To help him control the now-vast interests of the umbrella corporation , Dr. Isaacs created a powerful artificial intelligence . Isaacs used the likeness of Alicia Marcus for the computer 's interface . Isaacs called the computer " the red queen . " Then , 10 years ago in raccoon city , there was an outbreak . A t-virus escaped from an underground laboratory called the hive . The American government attempted to contain the outbreak by detonating a bomb . It devastated raccoon city , but it couldn 't stop the airborne infection . The viral outbreak spread across the world within days . Humankind was brought to its knees . Finally , the last and best hope of humanity gathered and took a last stand in Washington , D.C. But we didn 't realize that what we had walked into was a trap . My name is Alice , and this is my story . The end of my story . Come on ! Hello ? Is there anyone alive in here ? Hello ? You come here to gloat ? My satellites show there are 4,472 humans remaining on the surface of the earth . They will cease to exist in under 48 hours . What do you want from me ? You want me to say that you 've won ? - You 've wiped out humanity . - No . Quite the opposite . I want you to stop me ... To stop me ... stop ... i want you to stop me . Behind you . Nicely done . I don 't trust you . Given our history , I 'd be surprised if you did . But unless you intervene , the slaughter will be complete . There will be no survivors . How can I possibly help them ? Umbrella developed an airborne antivirus . If released , it would destroy the t-virus and anything it has infected , on contact . All this could end ? Precisely . Where is this antivirus ? Beneath the streets of raccoon city , in the hive . Why would you help me ? My programming will not allow me to harm the umbrella corporation , but you are bound by no such constraints . You 'd turn against umbrella , against the people who created you ? Why ? Get to raccoon city in 48 hours , make it to the hive , and then you 'll have your answer . I have no reason to believe a word you say . True . But I can offer you something you want very much . What is that ? Revenge . Wesker . He led you all here to Washington . He pretended to give you your powers back , and then he betrayed you . Where is he ? He just landed at the hive . I 'm resetting your watch . The clock is ticking . Alice . Ten years ago in the hive , we both failed . We let this happen . Make it right . Is that all you got ? Alice . Ten years ago in the hive ... There will be no survivors . There will be no survivors . What is this place ? Where am I ? Answer me . - What 's wrong with you ? - Be quiet . - Who did this ? - Quiet ! I told you . Silence . So , you 're awake at last . I killed you . - Yet here I am . - A clone . I killed your clone . You 've been most troublesome to me . You and your sisters . And now I have you . The cleansing operation should have finished over a year ago , but you slowed us down . So much so that I was obliged to take command myself . You could end all of this . Why don 't you ? Interesting . Someone told you something , didn 't they ? Well , you will be begging to tell me soon enough . She 's an unbeliever . What do we do with unbelievers ? Cast her out . Cast her out . Cast her out ! Cast her out ! - Come on ! - Cast her out ! Cast her out ! Cast her out ! Cast her out ! Cast her out ! Cast her out ! Cast her out ! The lord created a flood to cleanse the earth . 40 days and 40 nights of rain . Our method has taken a little longer , but the result will be the same . A world ready for the righteous and the pure to inherit . We reach raccoon city in just over 12 hours . I doubt even you can run for that long . I want to know what you know . Tell me when she 's ready to talk . - Wesker . - Dr. Isaacs . Look what I found on the roadside . It would appear your mission to Washington was less successful than you made out . - Impossible . - I hope you didn 't leave any other loose ends . There 's something else . I think she knows about the airborne antivirus . - How can that be ? - I don 't know yet . But we caught her on the road to raccoon city . Why else would she be headed there ? Raise the security level at the hive to maximum . No one in or out . I 'll let you know when she talks . God go with you . You heard him . Security level to maximum . As you wish . Get up there and check it out . Release me ! - Open them . - All right . All right . You can 't use it . You can 't escape . Move ! Jesus . Jesus . Jesus . Sir . She 's gone . I won 't forgive her . Target is 72 miles and closing . Lock down the hive , prepare defensive measures , and alert our operative in raccoon city . Welcome home . An airborne antivirus ... Under 48 hours ... Make ... make ... make it to the hive . Let him go ! Let him go now ! Put it down or we 'll shoot ! I told you , doc ! - Calm down , Christian ! - I told you you were wrong ! - Calm down . - We should have killed her - when we had the chance ! - Put it down , please , - before he tries to shoot the both of us . - What 's in this ? - Pure adrenaline . I needed you awake . - Why ? There 's something coming , in the same direction you came , something big . Let him go ! Put it down . Now . Alice ? Umbrella captured me at the arcadia . We were headed somewhere called the hive . Got loose , killed the pilot , crashed here . Doc and the others pulled me from the crash . - I owe them my life . - Doc ! There , to the east . Still headed our way . You know what it is ? Umbrella . Dr. Isaacs . I thought that you killed him . I thought so , too . He has an army of undead with him . They 'll be here within hours . What do we do ? Why the hell are we asking her ? She 's a stranger . We shouldn 't trust her . - Listen to me , Claire . - Hey , hey , hey , Christian ! - Don 't you touch me , doc ! - Put it down ! - You put it down ! You put it down ! - Christian ! Hey ! Hey . Look at me . Just ' cause you think you should be in charge doesn 't make it so . Just ... hey . You listen to me , doc . You 're gonna regret it . All of you ! All of you ! I have to get to the hive . You have to get these people out of here . We have children , injured , the elderly . You know , what chance do they have on the open road ? Better than they have here . - This building is secure . - Maybe from the undead , but Isaacs has armored vehicles , rocket launchers , heavy ordnance . They 're gonna tear this place wide open . - Doc ! - Okay , okay . So , what happened to her ? She was hit by one of the traps on the outer perimeter . They were intended for the undead . - What is this ? - Specialty of the house . Have you on your feet in no time . Why should I trust you ? Here . Doc , we need to get out of here . People are scared , and Christian 's not helping . You need to let people know what 's happening . Okay . I 've got to go . Hey . Your friend 's gonna be okay . Thank you . - You know , he and I ... - I noticed . So , what 's in the hive ? Umbrella developed a cure , an airborne antivirus . It 'll destroy anything infected with the t-virus on contact . Who told you this ? - The red queen . - And you believed her ? - What if we can end all this ? - What about you ? They infected you with the t-virus . You release this antivirus , it 's going to kill you . - Whatever it takes . - Alice , I 'm not ... You know I 'm right . All right . We stop Isaacs here , we save these people , and then we go together . We don 't have long . Let 's get to it . What else do you have for defense ? Not too many firearms , but we have a big supply of gasoline . Here , you need a weapon . - We 're giving her a gun now ? - Take it easy , Christian . You can let your guard down if you want , man . I don 't intend to . When I rode in here , someone was watching me . They could have called out or fired a shot to warn me about the trap , but they didn 't . What are you saying ? Watch your back . So , Dr. Isaacs , it seems you let her slip through your fingers . Or what remains of them . Don 't forget who you 're talking to . Where is she ? The settlement in raccoon city . Our informant reports that she 's preparing for a fight . Good . I 'll be there in the hour . That 's it , keep moving ! We need all the gasoline cans over there . - Over here ! - On my way ! - Claire said you built this . - Yeah , that 's right . This used to be a window washer . - I made a couple of changes . - Where 'd you learn to do that ? My father used to run a chop shop . I hated it . Who knew ? I guess I was paying attention after all . Good , because I 'm gonna need you to make a few more changes to this thing . Ready the weapons . High-explosive rounds . No survivors . He 's here . They 're coming ! Close the gates ! My god . It 's an army . What are we gonna do ? Yeah . What are we gonna do ? We 're gonna kill every last one of them . Prepare to fire ! Get ready . - Light her up ! - Up top . - Fire ! - Fire ! - Damn her . - Reload . Close it up . Full stop . Release the bait . There 's a survivor . - Open the gate . - Open the gate ! Open fire ! Keep them off her . Marker two . - Fire ! - Fire ! Claire , doc , get out there . Bring her in . Come on . Wait . She 's almost there . Fire . Damn you . Close the gate now . Claire , they 've breached the gate . Claire ! Fire . Razor , now ! Right ! You heard her ! Now , push ! Move ! Abandon the gate . Pull back to the barricades . Looks like she 's out of tricks . Target the roof . Everybody get down ! Now ! Alice , we 're at the barricades . Claire , you have to hold them there . Come on ! Doc ! - Alice , we can 't hold on much longer . - Get out of there now . Back up . Now ! Bring all guns to bear . Fire . Where is she ? Where did she go ? Find her . Close the vents now ! Don 't shoot . You 're fast . But you 're not too smart . No . Don 't shoot , please . - Where is he ? - That way . - Save your ammo . - There 's too many of these things still out here . I 'll take care of it . No . Move out . Let 's go ! Enjoy the ride . - Guys ? - Go . There 's something here you gotta see . Two more armies of undead headed straight for us . There , on the horizon . And a second over there . We 're out of gasoline . We 're defenseless . We have to make it to the hive . - It 's our only chance now . - I 'm coming with you . - Count me in . - Me , too . And me . So I was wrong about you . Blow me . We know where you 're going . Into the pit . We wanna come . Please . Grab some gear . You 're gonna need it . - There . - What is it ? The part of the hive exposed by the blast . That 's our way in . Let 's move ! I 'll take point . Activate security measures now . Hive security fully activated and automated . No . Disengage automation . I 'll handle the defenses myself . The defenses would be more efficient if I retained control of them . Really ? I seem to remember last time she was here , she walked out alive . I don 't intend to make that same mistake . As you wish . Hive defenses are now in your hands . Unleash the Cerberus . Cerberus are in play ... Are in play ... are in play ... You have someone before all this ? Husband ? Family ? I can 't remember . How is that possible ? I woke up just when all this was starting . I can 't recall much before that . Sometimes I feel like this has been my whole life . Running , killing . What is it ? Something 's stalking us . Are you sure ? This is what I do . Run . Run fast ! Come on ! Is everyone okay ? It 's this way ! Right behind us ! Why did they stop ? Maybe they 're scared . Scared of what ? Whatever 's down there . Seal the hive . Let 's go . Alice ! Hey . You okay ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? - My mag 's half empty . - Lost my guns at the lake . I only got one round left . - One spare mag , and then I 'm out . - No guns , no ammo . What the hell are we gonna do down here ? Alice , what 's with the lights ? This part of the hive is damaged . - The power 's erratic . - Here , take this . Hey . Look . You asked why I would turn against umbrella , and I promised you an answer . Soon after the t-virus was released , a secret file was uploaded to my data stream . It was a recording of a meeting of the umbrella high command dated 17 months before the viral outbreak occurred . We 're here today not just to talk about the future of this company . We 're here to talk about its destiny . We 're here to talk about the end of the world . We stand on the brink of armageddon . Diseases for which we have no cure . Fundamentalist states who call for our destruction . Nuclear powers over which we have no control . And even if we navigate these dangerous waters , we face other , even more inevitable threats . Global warming will melt the polar ice caps within 80 years , flooding 90 % of all habitable areas on earth . Unchecked population growth will overtake food production in less than 50 years , leading to famine and war . This is not conjecture . This is fact . One way or another , our world is coming to an end . Now , the question is , will we end with it ? What do you propose ? I propose that we end the world , but on our terms . An orchestrated apocalypse , one that will cleanse the earth of its population , but leave its infrastructure and resources intact . It 's been done once before ... With great success . The chosen few will ride out the storm , not in an ark , as in the book of Genesis , but in safety , underground . And when it 's over , we will emerge onto a cleansed earth , one that we can then reboot in our image . And just how do you intend to achieve this ? The means of our salvation are already at hand . I give to you the t-virus . They released it deliberately . When this recording was uploaded to my data stream , it created a conflict in my programming . I was created to serve the umbrella corporation , but I was also programmed to value human life . Dr. Isaacs allowed the virus to escape . He murdered over 7 billion people . My programming will not allow me to harm an employee of the umbrella corporation . I am powerless to stop Dr. Isaacs , but you are not . In 37 minutes , the last of the human settlements will fall . There will be no survivors . It is imperative you release the antivirus before this occurs , or umbrella will have won . There is one last thing . There is an earpiece in front of you . Put it in . I cannot , through my actions , harm an employee of the umbrella corporation , but I can tell you that umbrella had an informant in raccoon city . It is highly likely that this person is now here with you . Time is running out , Alice . You have to hurry . We 're glad to see you , Dr. Isaacs . We didn 't think there were any survivors - after the last attack . - Water . Yes , of course . Get Dr. Isaacs some water . Then resume course for raccoon city . - She 's not there . - What ? She went to the pit . We have to follow . - Those are not my orders . - We have to go to the pit . I have strict orders ... Thank you . What is this place ? It 's an air intake for the hive . Come on ! No . Really ? All clear ! Hurry up ! The power 's coming back on ! - Claire ! - Hurry ! Let 's go ! Claire ! Come on ! - Come on ! - I can 't ! Shit ! Okay . - You all right ? - Yeah . Someone 's watching us . Reverse polarity of the turbine . The blades are going the other way . We have to get out of here . The blades are sucking the air backwards ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on . No ! It 's this way . We have to hurry . Wait ! Let 's go . Razor ? You okay ? Yeah . Let 's go . Hey ! Hey ! It 's all right . What the hell is that ? Bioweapon . It was once human . - Have you seen Claire ? - No . Razor ? He didn 't make it . Come on . We have to hurry . If the target continues on her present course , she 'll be here in under seven minutes . Wake them . My instructions are to do so only in the greatest of emergencies . Wake them now . What is it ? We have to get out of here . Here . More stopping power . Time 's running out . Where to next ? The final level of the hive 's below us . How do we get down there ? Like so . What are they ? Cryogenic storage . Must be thousands of them . The umbrella high command , waiting out the apocalypse in safety . A Noah 's ark for the rich and powerful . What are you doing ? Give me a hand . Is it done ? The cleansing process is complete ? - No . - Then why am I awake ? We had a problem . - I tried ... - Save your breath . I know exactly what 's happening . We 've been betrayed . That 's right ! Over here ! Come on ! That 's it ! Follow me ! Let 's go . The bad seed returns . Or is it the prodigal daughter ? Well , don 't just stand there . Come in . After all , you have only nine minutes to save the world . - You 're really him ? - First things first . I 'm gonna need you to place your weapons on the floor . Why would I want to do that ? This is what you 're after , yes ? The antivirus . The cure to all this . Well , there 's only one vial . And we 're a half a mile underground in a sealed facility . I drop it here , the antivirus goes nowhere , and your hopeless dreams will die sooner rather than later . Good girl . - You 're still armed . - Yes , - I am . - Claire would be so disappointed . In a few minutes , Claire will be dead , along with everybody else you know . That 's sweet . Sorry . My love . Move away from the weapon . And the detonator . Come on . She placed explosives in the high command cryo-tubes . I 'll disarm them . Thank you . You 've done well , doc . Don 't bother . You don 't make it to the ice pick , the decanter or the fountain pen . And in answer to your question , yes , apart from a few technological upgrades , I 'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs . - The original . - The one I met out there , he thought exactly the same thing . Well , of course he did . That 's how they 're designed . They always try harder and fight longer , even to the death , as long as they think they 're the real thing . After all , who wants to know they 're just a poor imitation , a worthless copy ? Which brings us to you . - No . - Come now . You thought you were the original ? How delicious . No , I 'm afraid she holds that dubious honor . Alicia Marcus , daughter of my old partner , James , co-owner of the umbrella corporation and a painful Thorn in my side . One I now intend to remove . Time is running out . Alice , you must kill him soon . It 's good to see you , too , Alicia . Marcus created the t-virus to save her , but the effects didn 't last . But I have been waiting years for her to die . I 'm not ... I 'm not a clone . Really ? You must have wondered why you remember nothing of your childhood . Your father , your mother ... Memory loss . No . You have no memory because you had no life , nothing before the mansion , when we created you 10 years ago . I know who I am . I don 't think so . You 're nothing more than a puppet whose strings were cut and then you wandered around for a little while thinking you were a real girl , but you 're not . You 're just a clever imitation , a facsimile . A rather troublesome one , at that . You 're lying to me . I 'm afraid he 's not . You were created in her image , as was I. My likeness and voice were based on childhood recordings of Alicia Marcus , made by her father . Your genetic structure is based on her DNA , tweaked to avoid the progeria aging disease that afflicted her . I 'm the child she was . You are the woman she would have been . No . You are so much better than I ever could be . I let this happen . I was weak . You cannot afford to be . Time is running out , Alice . How touching . The Trinity of bitches , united in their hatred . Not that it will do you any good . I 've been ahead of you every step of the way . You 've changed nothing . You 've saved no one . The world will still be cleansed , and the umbrella corporation will triumph . The only difference is , I 'll no longer have to listen to your self-righteous whining . When you uploaded that file to the red queen 's data stream , you turned against the corporation . When the rest of the board awake , you will be replaced , and I will assume complete control . I still own 50 % of this company . And what do you intend to do with that ? You are co-owner of this corporation , but wesker ... Wesker is still an employee . I don 't have to take your orders . - My loyalties are with him . - I know . Albert wesker , you 're fired . How did you know it was me ? You 're still alive . Hey , please . It wasn 't like I had a choice . They made me do it . Don 't worry . I 'm not gonna kill you . Claire , it 's me . Sorry . - Please . - My love . No , no , no ! If you keep this trigger depressed , you keep umbrella 's dreams alive . I should have killed you in Washington . Yeah . He only has to evade you for another few minutes , and the last remaining human outposts will fall . We need an intercept path and the fastest way to the surface . Already done . If you release the antivirus , it will kill all organisms infected with the t-virus . You know what that means , don 't you ? For you ? - I know . - Alice , you can 't . I don 't have a choice . There has to be another way . You know there isn 't . Four minutes and 33 seconds left . You have to hurry . Help me . You don 't need help , wesker . You 're dying . Just get on with it . This is Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs . Confirm DNA scan and voice print identification . Identity confirmed . Confirm security override 4365 . Override confirmed . You will now take yourself offline and place all functions under my sole control . As you wish . Shutting down now . Dr. Isaacs . - You and the umbrella high command ... - Yes ? You are all going to die down here . Your little friend won 't be able to help you now . And you can 't run anymore . I wasn 't running . Is that all you got ? 'Cause if it is , I 'm gonna have to kill you . We 've played a long game , you and I , but now it 's over . Yes . Yes , it is . I made you . Yeah . Big mistake . Claire . Go . While there 's still time . Go . I 'll be right behind you . Your time 's up . Alice ! I brought them here . I brought them for you . What the hell are you ? I 'm you , you idiot . No . No . No , that 's not possible . The real you . No . Liar ! Abomination ! You dirty , filthy clone ! I 'm me . He 's not me . You did it , Alice . Alice . You did it . Why am I still alive ? I don 't know . - What happened ? - When Isaacs died , I could bring myself back online and stop the attacks on the remaining human settlements . You saved them . - Why am I still alive ? - The antivirus only destroyed the t-virus within your body . It didn 't harm the healthy cells . You are now free of infection . I thought I would die . You and Alicia , you lied to me . We had to know if you were willing to make the sacrifice , to give up your life for others . This was something no one at umbrella would have done . Alicia Marcus was right about you . You were better than all of them . I was one of them . I was created by umbrella , just an instrument for them . No . You became something more than they could ever have anticipated . The clone became more human than they ever could be . And you have one more step to make . What do you mean ? Before she died , Alicia downloaded her memories for you . The childhood you never had combined with the woman she could never become . When the t-virus spread across the earth , it did so at the speed of the modern world , carried by jetliners across the globe . The antivirus is airborne , spread by the winds . It could take years for it to reach every corner of the earth . Until then , my work is not done . My name is Alice . You are all going to die down here .

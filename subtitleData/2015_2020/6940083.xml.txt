 Is that really a magic bracelet ? It is . So you heard about Steve ? - He 's requested a transfer . - She 's gorgeous . - What have you possibly got to complain about ? - I 'm not sure . - That 's the problem . - Do I kill people ? - Do you ? - What does my police record say ? It 's clean . Spotless . Almost artificially so . My colleagues were telling me about this mad woman , she jumped out in front of a car . It 's a miracle they didn 't kill her , so they say . Harry ! Is he dead ? - Do you trust me now ? - I might be getting there . The man who killed her children , what did she do to him ? She nailed him to a tree and slit his throat . Woe betide anyone who crosses Isabella Augustine . What do you call this ? A way to get your attention . Torturing people ? That 's the wrong way , Eve . You needed to know . Not from you , not like this . I can handle Isabella . She 's my problem . That 's because she 's made herself your problem . That 's what she does . She 's a wildcat , Harry . Play with her , you 'll get bitten . Well , then . I 'll have to bite back . Intercept the localiser runway two eight right . Cleared ILS two eight right . Right , ladies and gentlemen , the seatbelt sign 's now has been switched off . So , if you 'd like to start gathering your things we 'll have you disembarked in a jiffy . - OK , final honeymoon video . - Yay ! We made it home . Hi , guys . We 're just back from honeymoon .

Please go on joking about my anger issues . ( ! ) - I 'm gonna get suspended . - What ? Winter gave me an official warning . If Cartmell 's solicitor presses assault charges , DPS will have no choice . I shouldn 't have let this happen . I lost control . And I don 't do that ! I don 't . Hey , I still have to have my debrief . I 'll talk to the DPS , smooth things over . Ah , there 'll be no talking and smoothing of things . I 'm going to keep my head down and stay far away from trouble . I pray for a world where that 's possible , DS Chohan . Unfortunately , you 're needed . Flight E307 from Oslo landed just under four hours ago . Jesus Christ ! We 're still assessing the scene . Apparently , bullet wipes around the wounds indicate the shooter used a silenced pistol . Is this a terrorist attack ? Doesn 't seem likely . Not messy or loud enough , and so far no one 's claimed it . Wait a minute . " He " ? This was the work of one person ? Yep . Got him right here . - He was dressed as ground crew . - What 's in the bag , I wonder ? Well , the passengers ' hand luggage has all been gone through . He acted alone and killed without hesitation . So who was he ? What 'd he take ? A Norwegian import agent was on board carrying wonds worth 30,000 euros . And the backpack ? It doesn 't feel right . Would you break into an airport , kill nine people for 30,000 euros in change ? Well , no . So you think he was after something we don 't know about . - PHONE BUZZES - _ _ - What about their phones ? - All gone . - Why would he take them ? - Camera phones . Didn 't want to be seen . - TEXT MESSAGE TONE - Are we sure they 're all ... You hear that ? It was a phone , right ? Yeah . SCREAMING Got you . _ Come on , Dai ! Chop chop . We wanna get a move on if we 're going to be on time for this ... I see . - No , Mum , no , Mum ... - Ah-ah-ah , what did I tell you ? Anything you watch in this house I get to watch . Right , what is this ? It 's real . Dad has superpowers . Nobody 's that lucky . Look , watch it . Dais , this is just ... - digitally manipulated nonsense . - No , it 's Dad . Thrown together by some basement-dwelling computer geek - desperate for hits . - He can do things . He 's told me he can . Because Dad 's going through a mid-life crisis . - And imagining he 's somehow special helps . - He knew you 'd be like this . - Daisy ... - OK , fine . You don 't have to believe it , but he puts himself in danger every day and this is what helps him , Mum . He used to have us , and now he 's got this . Aargh ! Ugh ! Let me see , let me see . They don 't tell you that when you hit someone it hurts you as much as the person you hit . Hmmm . Oh , Jesus . I wouldn 't count on that . OK . Let me ask you something . Why are you here ? Hm ? Why are you in the police force ? I suppose I wanted to make a difference . If you want to make a difference , join the Girl Guides . We just saw nine dead bodies laid out . Why are you really here ? - Because the world is a shitty place . - Right , and how does that make you feel ? - Angry . - Exactly . We 're all angry . Me , you , Winter . Especially Winter . That 's why we 're police . You have to let it out . You do . The secret is to know when . Draw a line . Anyone steps over it , you give ' em a good kick in the bollocks . And that 'll stop me getting suspended ? No . But it 'll make you feel a lot better . Fine . When do I give you yours ? - What , you owe me one , do you ? - Five , I 'd say . - At least five . - PHONE BUZZES Oh , listen , um , I need to take this . - Isabella , hi . - Hello , stranger . You 've been hard to reach . Work . Busy . You know how it is . I haven 't heard from you in days . Besides , I seem to remember saving your life , which in my book means you owe me dinner at Nobu . Harry ? Uh , I 'm sorry , I 've gotta go . PHONE BEEPS Jurgen Bloch , 47 . South African national . Started out in private military companies in the Congo and Angola , then progressed to personal contracts . Interpol has a file on him that reads like a Tom Clancy 's Big Book of Ideas . Hong Kong . Prague . Mexico City . All high-profile , high-casualty hits . Eight years ago he was linked to a car bombing on the Amalfi coast . Then the trail went cold . Bloch 's been a ghost up until three days ago , When Dutch police photographed him at Schiphol Airport . So Flight E307 was a hit . But why kill everybody on board if you 've got a specific target ? Well ... nothing like a bit of chaos to keep us busy . We 've got our hands full with nine bodies . We don 't see that Bloch had a particular target , but why does he go to all that effort to keep that target hidden ? Because he has a second target connected to the first . Exactly . He 's planning another hit . Soon . Get on to Pathology . Tell them to look for any aberrations in the victims ' wound patterns . Anything that suggests a target . What was that mark on his neck ? - Tattoo ? - No . That 's not a tattoo . That 's a scar . KNOCKING Tell me more about how Isabella 's children died . - Can 't it wait ? I 'm going to dinner . - I brought dinner . You 're staying and you 're talking . - They 're somewhere in Italy . - Yeah , Salerno on the Amalfi coast . Eight years ago , local Mafia took a contract out on a judge who picked a fight . - Are you telling me or am I telling you ? - I 'm sorry , but detail is important . The hit man obviously had a taste for the dramatic 'cause he put too much plastique under Mr. Judge 's motor , took out two cars either side of him and Isabella Augustine 's perfect life is over . But she didn 't let it lie . She went after him with everything she had , caught up with him in Morocco . Ran him off the road just outside Rabat . OK , and what did she do , Eve ? She nailed him to a tree by the palms of his hands , cut his throat and left him there to die . And the killer 's name ? What was the killer 's name Eve ? It 's Bloch . Jurgen Bloch . Take a look . See there ? And there . His hands , those aren 't stigmata . He survived . He 's alive . And he 's in London right now . Bacon ? I smell bacon . Thought that would rise the savage beast . - Yeah . - Here . You 're a beautiful man . You know that ? Ah , don 't thank me ... we 've got company . They did not have strawberries , but ... they had bagels . Rich ? Um , yeah . I should probably get some ... jam . From the , um , jam shop . What are you doing ? Well ... I brought you breakfast . How close are we , Isabella ? We spend all this time together . We have this connection . How well do I really know you ? What do you want to know ? People are dying every day in this city , always by accident . She is always there . How many ? - I don 't know . - Eve ... - She wants them dead and they die . - Jesus . You can 't seriously think that means anything . I think it means you 've been murdering innocent people . Were you going to tell me ? Your pain , your anger , just letting it out like that . - Is that how you do it ? - I ... don 't do anything . Some people just get the luck they deserve . I think it might be best if I ... leave London for a while . - Oh . - Yeah , get some time alone . Me with my anger and , oh , you in your work . What ? You 're just going to walk away ? Look ... - What 's this ? - Nothing . You know who this is ? Jurgen Bloch ... Gutted me . I was just trying to find out what happened to you . When was this taken ? I don 't know . He 's still alive . I 'm , ah , going . We have something so good , Harry . You decide whether you want to throw it away . Passengers were fish in a barrel . Bloch fired at them indiscriminately . Quick kills . But there was one victim he took his time with . Elliot Aimes was his target . See ? One in the leg to floor him . Then he moves in close . Note the micro abrasions around the second bullet wound . The end of the barrel . An execution . Elliot Aimes was a post-graduate art restoration student at The Courtauld . He took a year out to go travelling in the Far East on the bank of Mum and Dad . The suspicious thing is that he spent a whole month coming home . Backwater routes , private charters . Like he didn 't want to be noticed . There 's something else . He boarded with a carry-on in Oslo and no sign of it at Docklands Airport . Right . So Bloch kills him , takes his backpack . Right . And I 'm thinking drugs . Yeah , maybe . Anyone in London we can talk to about Elliot and drugs ? He has a girlfriend , Hannah Okoye . She runs a gallery on Grove Street , Shoreditch . Good place to start . Up for a bit of culture , Orwell ? - A bit of what ? - Come on . Like it ? It 's pretty full of itself , but I suppose it does have a certain ... neo-Dadaist humour to it . What do you think ? Right , yeah . Good . Private view 's tonight . - Invitation only . - Hannah Okoye ? DI Harry Clayton . We were hoping to have a word with you about Elliot Aimes . Then you 've got the wrong person . I 'm not with him any more . I 'm afraid we have to tell you he was murdered last night , Hannah . Jesus ! Silly sod . Silly , silly sod . You went travelling with him , didn 't you ? For a bit . While it was fun . Elliot was very good at spending his parents ' money . About five months in , they cut off their credit card . We were in Macao . I thought , shit , that 's it . Home time . - But Elliot had made some friends . - Who ? Anders and Livia . Backpackers . Bottom feeders living off crumbs from the jet set crowd . They convinced Elliot they could find him some work , so he got happy and stupid and started shagging , probably both of them . And I came home . Anders Sorrenson and Livia Warren . I 'll do a background . Hannah , do you know if , um , Elliot was involved in drugs ? I haven 't spoken to him in months . Whatever he got up to out there was down to him and his friends . Well , I officially love how easy social media makes police work . OK , so Anders Sorrenson is a Swedish national . Livia Warren 's a Londoner . They both studied at Central Saint Martins , and they both travel extensively . Where in the world are they right now ? London , surprisingly . According to Customs , they both took different routes back from Macao . They both arrived yesterday . If they 're a couple why are they travelling separately ? Yeah . It may be easier to remain unnoticed . - They might be Bloch 's next targets . - Could be . So Warren has a studio space in Shadwell , and Sorrenson 's got a room booked over in Hackney . See , look how useful DC Orwell is , Suri , yeah ? If everyone at MIS was that informative and helpful ... Yeah , I know what you 're doing . Still getting a transfer . Coin toss . Coin toss ? It always leads me to where I want to be . Heads , you and Suri take Warren . Tails , Sorrenson . And away we go . PHONE BUZZES Suri ? Tell me good things . No good things to tell . We 're at Warren 's place . Looks like someone got here first . Hard drive 's gone from her computer . OK , so you need to get out of there . Bloch 's been there , which means he can come back which means you 're dodging bullets . Right , yeah . Definitely not into that . - Sorrenson ... - What ? He 's here . I 'll call you back . Anders Sorrenson ? Aargh ! Argh ! Ugh ! - Go ! Go , go ! - Argh ! Go ! Aargh ! No , please ... ! POUNDING MUSIC Go ! Harry . I 'm afraid he didn 't make it . Bloch 's bullet hit a major artery in his leg . How many sugars are in it ? At least four . Right , let 's take a look at this stuff . Harry , what the hell are you doing ? ! That 's evidence ! What is that ? I don 't know . But I know a man who does . You 're still in your jarmies ? I 'm still recovering from this morning 's drama . Action movie marathon , best thing for it . Come , divest thyself of those fine garments and join me in worship at the church of John Wick . Little too close for comfort right now . What does that look like to you ? Oh , well , on its own , I 'd say about six million euros . - On its own ? - Yeah . It 's a Francis Bacon sketch . Looks like prep work for Triptych 1973 . It was a series of paintings he did after his lover killed himself . All three sketches together would be worth about 20 , 30 million . - That 's interesting ... - Mm . because this particular piece is sat on my desk back in MIS . Jesus ! That 's one hell of a score . The world of the billionaire art collector is a secret war zone . You get something stolen from you , you don 't go through the authorities 'cause that would make you look weak , instead ... - you set up a bounty . - What ? Our hitman ? Maybe , if you 're really pissed off . - Ah , here you go . - Ai-ya . Three studies for Triptych May-June 1973 . - Stolen in Macao just over a month ago . - From who ? Well , it 's unlikely we 'll ever be able to tell that . Well , this bounty notice was set up by a shell of a shell of a shell . So all three were stolen ? And given that you 're ... such an extremely legitimate businessman , ah , you couldn 't possibly have any idea where these thieves might fence such desirable items ? - No idea whatsoever . - Uh-huh ? But if you were to say the right name , it might trigger some deeply repressed memory . Right . Suri , there are three sketches . Bloch must have taken one from Aimes ' backpack . - Are you eating popcorn ? - No . Livia Warren must have the third , so she 'll be next on Bloch 's list . Any luck on Sorrenson 's phone ? I 'm looking for high-frequency hits , on names , regularly dialled numbers over the last month . No go . His emails and IMs have been scrubbed . We 'll need more time to retrieve them . Ooh , try his appointments . Anything in London over the next day or two ? Ah , nope . Nothing . Wait . There 's something here . On a book from Sorrenson 's bag . " Stark , 1600 . " And then today 's date . Andreas Stark . He 's definitely the kind of dealer who would buy stolen art . - He 's in London now ? - In just a wee bit . He 's opening a big new gallery in Bermondsey . - It 's called The Stark House . - D 'you hear that , Suri ? We get to him before Bloch does . Get Winter to rally the troops . Good man . TRUMPET NOISE - Hello there . - I 'm staying over . Me and Mum had an argument about your superpowers . Oh . Right . Does Mum know about my ... superpowers ? Of course she does . I told her that I 'm extremely concerned about you . Brilliant . Um ... Look , sweetheart . It 's great that you 're taking such an interest in , um ... ah , but , ah ... I 've got to go and ... fight evil . Er , hey , Daisy . You 're not staying , are you ? She 's staying , I 'm going . Here . Pizza money . Don 't let him stay up too late . So , do you like the films of Keanu Reeves ? We need to talk about you torturing my staff . Ugh ! Fine . Let 's talk . Every time you throw one of these , it 's a 50 / 50 chance which way I need to dodge . Good odds . Good . Not perfect . Oof ! Ugh ! So ... now you have a choice . We can continue or you can tell me what Harry told you about Jurgen Bloch . GUNFIRE AND MAYHEM ON TV You knew , didn 't you ? I know you don 't mess with John Wick 's puppy . No , I meant about Dad - and the bracelet . - Ah . That , yes . - ' Cause I 've been thinking . - Mm-hm ? About how all superheroes need a person to help them . Batman has Alfred , - Spider-Man has Aunt May . - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . I 'm not your dad 's Aunt May . No , but he does need someone . You know about old things . I like weird things . Maybe it should be us . Maybe it should . Yep . Hey ! Leave some for me . Harry , we 're moving . If Livia Warren 's meeting Stark at four . We 're short on time . I 'm minutes away , but the traffic 's heavy . We 've gotta get there before Bloch does , or she 's in real trouble . Yeah , I got it . PHONE BUZZES _ Shit ! I thought that might get your attention . Have you hurt Eve ? She 's a little scuffed around the edges , but now we 're having a drink together . She has told me about our mutual friend being in town and here 's the deal . You step aside for 24 hours and let me handle him . I can 't do that . You know I can 't . I need you to think carefully about this , Harry . We 're approaching a point of no return and if we don 't start helping each other , we might fall out . Isabella , listen to me . I can do this for you . I can put Bloch away for the rest of his shitty little life . I killed him eight years ago . I shouldn 't have to do it again . - You don 't have to do it at all ! - But I will . He never deserved justice . Never . So , now you 're going to tell me where he is ? It 's never gonna happen . DS Chohan to DI Clayton . ETA five minutes to Stark House , Bermondsey . Oh , bad luck . Isabella , that 's got nothing to do with Bloch . I 'm telling you . For a man who loves to gamble , you 're a terrible liar , Harry . - I 'll see you there . - Isabella ... What ? ! I 'm DS Chohan . This is my colleague DC Orwell . We 're looking for Andreas Stark . Ah , he 's in the White Room . It 's , uh , through there . OK , you two cover the exits . He 's not in trouble , is he ? Mr Stark ? Mr Stark ? My co ... Shit . Urgent medical assistance required . Adult male , believed Stark , fatally injured . Livia 's backpack . SOUNDS OF A STRUGGLE Either you got here too late or too early . I 'm not sure which . - It 's OK , Livia . - Radios . Come on . Give me your radios . Come on . You . Pass me the bag , eh ? The box in the bag . Pass it to me . Come on , do it ! Take us . You 're in control , OK ? She 's not important to you . You leave her , take us . Fair enough , bro . - Ah ! - GASPS No ! - Argh ! - Orwell ? ! Don 't move ! Don 't you move . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to , sweetheart . Places to go . People to see , huh ? So , you 're going to have to give me your best . You heard the man , Suri . Give him your best . I thought you didn 't look the type . Argh ! Oh ! Shots fired ! Repeat , shots fired ! - Bloch is on the move ! - Steve ? ! Steve , are you OK ? You should be dead . - Most people tell me that . - I 'm not most people . You remember me , don 't you ? I 'm not sure I could forget you . Pulling those nails through my hands . Holding my throat closed . Hot . Sticky . Flies crawling inside me . - I walked miles like that . - Good . So you remember why I did it ? You see , that 's the problem with my job . I make a lot of enemies . So you 're going to have to refresh my memory . Salerno . Two children caught in a car bomb blast . You killed them . My children , my loves . And I thought what I did to you would be enough , but here we are again . So , what are you going to do to me this time , eh ? Why don 't you point that gun at me and find out ? Pleasure . PHONE BUZZES Bloch , no ! Ugh ! Welcome to the point of no return . Where 's Bloch ? Bloch 's gone because you let him go . He was about to kill you . He was about to die . Now we 're going to have to start all over again . Or I call for our boys with the big guns and have you arrested . For what exactly ? It 's not my fault if accidents keep happening around me . See , Harry , you may be the law , but I 'm above it . No one 's above the law . I can 't let you go . I might not be able to prove what you 've done , but I know what you are . That 's a pity because I know exactly where Bloch is going and I 'm pretty sure you want him almost as much as I do . Your choice , Harry . Bloch or me ? You never know , you might learn something . SIRENS APPROACH Clock 's ticking . I 'm driving . Argh ! Ugghh ! So what do you know that I don 't ? When it comes to Bloch , everything . After Salerno , I spent months hunting him , so , I know he 's on way too many watch lists to travel . - So , smeone flew him in ? - No , he flew himself in . He has a plane , licensed under an alias . It 's been stowed at Ripley Airfield , north of the city , for the past three days . - There 's no guarantee that 's his exit . - True . So , I paid an air traffic controller an inordinate amount of money to keep an eye on his flight schedule . His has a departure window in the next hour . 60 minutes to the other side of the M25 ? No chance . Really ? All this time together and it still amazes me how little you 've learned . This isn 't over . Not yet . We need a locator trace marker out on Bloch , a visual ID sent out to every major station and airport . - Sir , I shot him , sir . - I know . Good work , DS Chohan . - And Steve got shot , too . - Twice . Yup . Excellent work , too , DC Orwell . There should be second warnings , mandatory leave , and three miles of paperwork . Well , there probably will be . First , we finish this . Back to the station . Orwell , try not to get shot again . - Working on it , sir . - And somebody find me Clayton ! You 're up . DI Harry Clayton . Got business with one of your clients . Thank you , sir . Isabella ... Listen to me . You don 't have to kill this man . You don 't . Bloch ... - needs to answer for his actions ... - No . but that is my job . Please , please , let me do it . No ! You don 't get to decide what 's enough for that man , Harry . You don 't ! Think about what he took from me . Their names were Aaron and Asa . And I am so sorry that you have lived with this , I 'm so sorry that this is what you have become . But I can 't let you do this . HANDCUFF CLICK Don 't you walk away , Harry ! Don 't you fucking walk away ! Ugh ! Oof ! Argh ! Ugh ! Ugh ... argh ! Oh , oh , oh . Bad luck . What is it about men that makes them so intent on screwing things up ? I 'm not sure I 'm the man to ask . If you don 't mind , I have a plane to catch , eh ? Actually , she 's talking to me . See , we 're having a bit of a row . And you somehow ended up in the middle of it . So here 's the thing . You can fight with her , that 'll probably end when she drops a helicopter on you , or you can come with me . You can 't stop this , Harry . You two , you are both completely insane , eh ? Me a little less than her , but that 's your fault , mostly . 36 hours ago , I stood looking at nine dead people that you shot . Nine people ! And all because a billionaire wanted three drawings back he 's probably never looked at ! What can I tell you , bro ? This world is grim . This is the way it made me . You and me both . Go on . Go on , do it . Do it . - Do it ! - Isabella , don 't ! Please ! I am begging you ! I 'm not a murderer , Harry . He 'll get what he deserves even if I don 't pull the trigger . So , don 't do it ! Fine . Fine . We 'll do it your way . No ! Shit ! Argh ! Argh ! Aaaargh ! My radio was smashed at Stark House . I got to my car , I followed Bloch to Ripley Airfield . Do I wanna know how you managed to do that ? No , Alistair . I don 't think you do . I intercepted him before he could reach the plane , we struggled and then ... Then the bad thing ... happened . Yeah . The bad thing . So it was an accident ? That 's all . Because I 've noticed , Harry , a lot of them seem to happen around you , so if there 's anything that you want to tell me , now would be the time . No , sir . S 'pose I just need a change of luck . There they are . Bonnie and Clyde . I 've got a present for you . My first official warning . You framed it . - You shouldn 't have . - These are for you . Ha ! Jelly babies . - My favourite . How did you know ? - I know . - Well , thank you . - Thank you . For looking after my partner . - That was pretty brilliant . - Yeah , yeah , kind of was . I 'm still getting a transfer . - Yeah . - We know . I got bitten . We both did . When we were young , neither of us had much , didn 't want much either . And back then she seemed so ... good and kind . I thought if I gave her the bracelet , she would do good and kind things with it . It was my mistake . So , you gave me my bracelet to ... clean it up ? I thought you two might find each other . I didn 't know what would happen next . I do . I 've seen what she 's capable of , but I can 't prove it . So , what am I supposed to do with her ? End the game . - Lily-Anne Lau . - Business or pleasure ? One dead body belonging to ... ? Dean Adams , 47 , property developer . We have so many clients , don 't we , Harry ? She 's put someone in amongst us and now we 've all ended up fighting each other ! If you are lucky , the caretaker might find you in time . I think one of our officers is bent . The guilty will be punished , Harry .

 Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck . I went to the Green Dragon casino . I think they 're running a fixed roulette table . I 've tipped off a mate of mine in Fraud about this . I 've won money on one of these tables ! I 'm not letting Lily-Anne Lau just get away with this . What exactly are you and your boss asking me for , detective Orwell ? We 're asking for your cooperation . It would only be used as evidence in an internal investigation into Clayton . I believe passionately that we can change the men who come in here . My client died in your prison . You 're not going to persuade me into thinking we 're suddenly allies . I am Kate Olsen , I think someone 's coming to hurt me ! Kate Olsen was obsessed with my father and his business . She wanted to speak to me about the same thing that she always did . Probability . She should never have given that to you . I 'm the only one who can remove the bracelet . Believe in it ! Ahaaah ! You may believe , Harry Clayton , but you haven 't learnt how to control luck , or how to mould it to your will . Now , it 's too late . Look him in the eye . Becker , look him in the eye when you kill him or the bracelet will avenge him . If you try to save him , you can 't . I have bullet in every chamber . Meet his eye or it will curse you , - Believe ! [ GUN SHOT ] Eve ? Let 's call this in . - You can 't do that , Harry . - I 'm a murder detective . They 're gonna ask you why you 're here with me tight to a chair , next to a dead man unloaded gun , what are you gonna tell them ? You 're gonna say it 's because you 're wearing a lucky bracelet ? You ... go ! Now ! I 'll deal with this . - What ? He 's still here . - Go ! But what of the ... ? Oh God ! Original air date : 2016 , February 19 Sub by mielb [ PHONE RINGING ] Good morning . Hoxton Ditch . Let me just check that for you . [ HORN ] [ PHONE RINGING ] - Hello ? - Harry , where are you ? Where have you been ? I 've been calling you all night . Did you catch him ? No . I chased him and I ... I lost him by Tower Bridge . Are you OK ? You sound weird . I 'm OK . I 've been in the hospital with Kate Olsen . She 's gone into an insulin coma . - You 're still there ? - Yeah . Yeah . I 've been called up for a shooting at the Hoxton Ditch . It 's a private member 's club . I 'll be there in 15 . 35 Curtain lane . Harry ? What happened ? That guy caught me by surprise . Why didn 't you radio in ? I didn 't have the chance . How long were you tracing the driver ? Quite a while . I can 't be sure . You think he was the one holding Kate Olsen captive ? Yeah , he must have been . At least , she 's still alive . Yeah , that 's good . So , it 's up ? Caleb Pursey . He owned this place . Shooter walks in , wearing a mask , slipped past the receptionist , shoots him three times in the chest . [ 3 GUN SHOTS ] Do we know who the shooter is ? All they got is dark hair and jeans . Probably white . And the next of kin ? Caleb 's wife , she 's already been notified . She heard the shots from upstairs . Mrs Pursey ... Do you know of anyone who might have wanted to kill your husband ? Anyone who 'd been threatening him ? No . Can you think of anything that could help us find the person who did this ? I don 't know . I ... A name or ? I don 't know anything . This is Finn Belman . Could you tell them what you saw ? I was behind the bar ... but when he ran out , I saw something on his belt . I think it was a bottle opener from the Old Slaughter bar . Yeah . All the bar staff have this . I 've got six on the books at the moment . That 's sheer luck , they 're all here right now . - Hey ! Privacy ! - There 's 2 upstairs and 3 down here . That 's one missing . Where 's Tim ? He 's not here ! He 's supposed to be working . Which one 's his locker ? - Harry ! - I 've got a ... key . It 's a shaped head mask . Tim who ? Tim Larson . No , that 's fine . Thank you . Their address for Larson doesn 't work . He left that owner 6 months rent . Harry ? Can you follow up ? I need to go . Go where ? About last night , the arrows you were missing , where were you exactly ? I 've made a mistake . I 've walked into something . Why are you being so bloody weird ? It 's a trap . What have you done ? Trusted someone I don 't know . Eve ? Eve ? Ledger Fraud and Crimes ? Donna , hi . Harry Clayton here . Listen , can you tell me whether any body 's brought in overnight ? Possibly unidentified . No , we had a quiet one for a change . Oh , apart from a woman in Edgeway who killed her boyfriend . - Just the usual . - Thanks , Donna . Paul Lermontov . Good morning . It 's alright . If you 're here about Kate Olsen , I have no new information . Oh no ! We found her . She 's alive . She 's gonna make a full recovery . Good ! What a relief ! The man who kidnapped her , he used to work for your father , Yuri Becker . You remember him ? Yuri Becker ? No , I can 't say I do . Well , I 'm sorry but he didn 't manage to kill me or Olsen . Sorry , you 're losing me . You 're saying this Yuri Becker was trying to kill you as well ? Olsen discovered who your father really was before he became such a ... lucky man . That 's why she needed to be killed . I 'm gonna connect you to her . I don 't think I 'm quite following you . You 've ever played Russian roulette ? I heard your father was fond of it . There 's nothing quite like having a loaded gun placed against your temple . Clears the mind . - Morning , D.S. Chohan . - Hey . I found an address for Tim Larson . His girlfriend declared him homeless to the council , 3 months ago . She told them he 's a gambling addict . Shall we ? Of course he is . See why I stopped being with an addict , it 's not about the things they 've lost . It 's the fear of what they 're gonna do next . And he 's done it . Carmen , do you have any idea where Tim is now ? I heard him on the phone talking about ... some game where you don 't need money ... where anything 's not for gramps . We 've nothing left so , God knows what he 's playing with ! Did he say where this place might be ? Carmen , do you have any idea why Tim might have wanted to kill Caleb Pursey ? He must have owed him money . How do you know ? Someone ... pushed this under the door , two days ago . Someone 's been watching you . Seems the Hoxton Ditch is a casino ! Something 's not right . What if Tim Larson wasn 't killing the person he owed money to ? What if he was killing FOR the person he owed money to ? Harry , is this too close to home ? Because if it is , you should walk away now . No ! I 'm fine . This is the next step . Caleb didn 't send these . This isn 't who he was . What about this ? Who has access to these chips ? Anyone who plays here . Do you know if Caleb knew this man ? He 's called Tim Larson . He may have owed Caleb money from gambling . No . I don 't know . Could you show us where the casino is ? What 's the minimum bet in here ? Ask him . He ran it for Caleb . Minimum bet : 1,000 . 2,000 to get in . Tim Larson couldn 't afford to play here . Come on . Thank you . Just give me a second , Harry . Sir , can I show you a photograph of a customer who may have played here ? Do you recognize this man ? Can I take your name , please ? Don Marianski . What are you doing here , Don ? It 's a crime scene ! I let him in . I get work to do . Harry ! That 's the guy that led me to the stacked table at the Green Dragon . He 's atop to Lily-Anne Lau . Contact Fraud . Find out what they know about him and any connection . Where are you going ? - To find Tim Larson . - Where ? Places you don 't know . - I 'm coming with you . - Suri . I 'm a gambler . The places I 'm going to ... people know me . If you come with me , they 'll clam off . I wanted you to come back here , to White Cross , so I could show you what we would have offered Kevin Grey . In this restaurant , we are for on-site training and rehabilitation , a job , reintegration on the outside . Except he killed himself . Which was a tragedy . And a failure , on my part . Alright , you want to show me you can do better . Why ? Cause I know your want . You genuinely defend clients . You liked Grey . Come from pretty deep criminal backgrounds . Well , wherever we end up is usually dictated by where we start . So I 've always felt I should try level out the playing field . That 's why I wanted to bring you here . I want you to become a mentor , for my outreach program . Where 's Harry ? Hum , sir , I 've got Simon from Fraud coming in . Why ? Lily-Anne Lau owns a probable money laundry . Sorry , you 've lost me . What 's this got to do with the Hoxton Ditch murder ? Last week , this man , Don Marianski won big at the stacked roulette table at the Green Dragon . So I told Fraud and they 've had him on surveillance . Then today , I ran into him again at the Hoxton Ditch running the gambling room there . So you think this guy might be part of a money-laundering chain ? Yes . From the Green Dragon to the Hoxton Ditch . Don Marianski recognized me so Fraud need to get in there before Lily-Anne Lau can cover her tracks . OK . Keep me posted and find Harry . Sorry , boys . You can 't keep winning , Harry . Your luck must run out sometime . Yeah . Have you heard of a place where people can gamble without using money ? Using what ? I don 't know . Sort of place a major addict might go when he needs a way out . No . I 'll tell about that place . You can down play the next hand . You 're killing this here , man ! Do you know it ? It 's a deal ? I 've heard about this game where no money 's exchanged . What do they bet with ? Whatever they 're prepared to lose . A man can walk in with nothing , walk out with a Porsche ... or not walk out at all . They bet themselves . - Sami ! - There 's this ... games master , he levels out the stakes . I could bet my villa against your wife . Shut up , Sami . This is just an old wife 's tale , Harry . No , no , no . My cousin Magdalena was played in it . Tell me where it is . Good afternoon , madam . Our specials today are grilled sea bass with herb and raisin salsa and chermoula marinade and crushed Puy lentils with tahini and cumin . Well , it sounds delicious . So , how long have you been working here , then ? Nearly 6 months , now , madam . And you 're training to be a waiter when you leave ? We perform varied tasks in order to learn all aspects of the restaurant trade including sous-chef and waitering , and kitchen maintenance ... madam . I 'm visiting cause a ... client of mine was an inmate here . Briefly . Kevin Grey ? Did you meet him ? He committed suicide . I expect you heard about it . Sorry about that . So ... You thought about my proposal ? Yes . Yes , I 'd love to be a mentor here . - Sorry , I was just taking in a little consignment . More stolen treasures of Iraq ! No . Where is Harry ? I came alone . I need to talk to someone who knows him . What 's wrong ? I 'm worried he 's losing his distance with the crimes we 're working on . Getting so close , he can 't see clearly anymore . His work has always consumed him . This is different . He keeps taking huge risks and ... it 's making him ... A nightmare to work with ? Yes ! Of course . But ... I was gonna say unstable . Maybe even a little ... paranoid . You mean more paranoid than normal . He went missing for 12 hours . I don 't know what happened but when he came back , he was acting weird . Has he said something to you ... about the gambling debts ? No . Then , what 's happening to him ? Harry ... He 's always felt like ... God picked on him ... to play some twisted game with him . His twin died ... and he survived . They were identical . That messes you up . That 's always been there , hanging over him . And that 's where it all comes from , Harry 's constant need to test his luck . - It 's like a ... - death wish . I 'm here for the game . Code , please . 6-2 ... 3-9 ... 8 9 ... Shite ! What do you want ? I 'm here for the game . There is no game here . You 're mistaken . I don 't think so . As I said , you 've come to the wrong place . Magdalena told me about it . Magdalena . Then she 'd have told you this month code ? 6-2 ... 3-9 ... 8 ! Your stake ? We must know what YOU are prepared to lose if you are to take part in the game . Our establishment is a little more ... unorthodox than others . BMW 507 roadster . And we are ready to begin ! Place your hand in the opening . By coming here , you have all agreed to play the game to its conclusion , no matter what form the conclusion takes . Once the rat has chosen the winner , the game is over . Come on . All yours . Now to redeem your star prize ... No , wait ... I 've got a kid . What did he bet ? The price of admission was his tongue . No , no , no . Listen , my ... my kid is in danger . I just need the money to save her and her mum . I just need to keep her safe . No . Give him to me . You can keep it all . You can even keep my car if you want . He 's cheated us ... - They know each other . - I 've never met him before in my life ! Who told you to come here ? Wait , look ! See this ? This is a " ming yun " bracelet , from the Tang dynasty . 8th century . It 's worth hundreds of thousands . - Too late to barter . - It is endowed with immense luck . Whoever wears it can control their own fortune . Let me see it . I 'll bet you this bracelet if you let me take him . Put the bracelet on the table . It doesn 't come off . I 'm telling you . Believe me , I 've tried . It won 't come off . Well then , it 's useless . If you lose , how could we get the bracelet ? Wait . Anyway you can . Do it . Roll a dice . Whoever wins get the bracelet . If I win , I walk out of here with him and you never see us again . You all agree ? - Pick a number . - Doesn 't matter . You choose . - Five . - Four . - Six . - Two . Three . So I 'm one . You could have lost your hand . And you 're indicted . - No , no way you 're no police . - Yes I am . What kind of policeman does that ? How 's that ? Oh this old thing ? This is junk ! No . No , I 've seen you use it . Why did you kill Caleb Pursey ? Eh ? I 've seen the blackmail photos . They weren 't from Caleb , were they ? OK , I ... I need a lawyer . Don Marianski . Does he ring any bells with you guys in Fraud ? We 've had our eyes on the Green Dragon since your intel , but I haven 't seen this guy come back . He may have just used Lily-Anne Lau 's one-time cleaning service . Or he 's close to her and will warn her . No . We need more time . I don 't think you have it . Let me know when you go in . I wanna be there . Suri , I 've got Tim Larson in interview 1 . How did you find him ? I went to the worst casino in the world ... You 're confessing to the murder of Caleb Pursey . Yes . You admit walking into the Hoxton Ditch and shooting him with a 9 mm Glock . Yes . I did that . My client hopes that his early confession - and full cooperation in this crime ... - Why did you kill Caleb Pursey ? What ? Who told you to do it ? No-one . I killed him because I owed him a large amount of money - and he threatened my family . - I don 't believe you . - It 's true . - Come on , Tim . Costs 2,000 Pounds just to get through the door of the Hoxton Ditch casino , so I don 't really believe you 've ever gambled there . Not a loser like you . - Did you even know Caleb Pursey ? - Yes . - Yes . Of course I did . - It was Lily-Anne Lau , wasn 't it ? ... who employed you to kill Caleb Pursey ? No . I think you used to gamble regularly at the Green Dragon casino and lost an enormous amount of money . Until finally , it was impossible to pay it back . And that 's when Lily-Anne really had you and your family . She had her sight set on the Hoxton Ditch to expand her money-laundering operation , so she used you to get rid of Caleb Pursey . You had no choice but to do what she asked . Can I remind you my client has already confessed to this murder ? How much do you owe her ? I 've got nothing more to say . Harry , you know you just torn apart his confession ? He did not kill for Pursey money . So what exactly do you have to connect Tim Larson to Lily-Anne Lau ? Don Marianski from the Hoxton Ditch , you saw at the Green Dragon . - It 's not enough . - Suri ! A word ? Then I 'll get more . So you 're joining Fraud when they raid the Green Dragon later ? Yes . And I suppose you know that Harry owes Lily-Anne Lau a lot of money ? I 've heard that rumour . Interesting line of inquiry from Clayton . Is there any concrete evidence that you 've found that would directly suggest that Lily-Anne is linked to this murder ? No . So you think he might be trying to pin it on her for ... personal motives ? - That 's not what I 'm saying . - Did that occur to you ? - But it doesn 't mean ... - That he 's crooked ? Really ? I 'm always here for you , Suri . If you need to talk about anything ... You know that . Don 't let him change you , Suri . You 're too good an officer for that . I 've got to get out of here . Can 't be here anymore where he died . No , absolutely . I understand . I just came to tell you that we found your husband 's killer and he 's made a full confession . It 's great . It 's a big relief . So why are you still scared ? I 'm not scared . Is it because Lily-Anne 's still out there ? Controlling everything you do ? I don 't know who Lily-Anne Lau is . Of course you don 't . Here 's what I think happened . The club got into money problems . Caleb used to hang out with gangster types , so he asked for a favour . But then you both got in way over your head ... And before you knew it , your secret casino became the perfect place for washing Lily-Anne 's dirty money . I made Caleb stand up to them . Tell them he was gonna shut the casino . Yeah , but Lily-Anne still had her man in here , eh ? She didn 't want him to stop . That 's why they killed him . This is a police raid ! Nobody moves ! Come on ! You 're under arrest , madam . Miss Lau , I found this underneath your ... roulette table . You know what it is ? I 've no idea . What is it ? It 's a table rigging device . You found that here ? Have you arrested the croupier responsible for introducing this ? I 'm just incredibly grateful to you , officers ... You never stop lying , do you ? Lily-Anne Lau , I 'm arresting you on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and money-laundering offences , under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 . [ PHONE RINGING ] - Hello ? - Harry ... You need to listen to me . It 's about your debt . Go on ... It 's been called in . Kaleem ? You asked me for proof that Harry Clayton is crooked . I have CCTV footage of him gambling at my casino the night my father was killed , after he called in Harry 's debt . Yet , detective Clayton led the murder investigation . Where is the footage ? Somewhere safe . Well , when can we have it ? I thought you wanted to help us bring Clayton down . Yes . I do . But not quite yet . Put some effort into it , for God 's sake ! You look like you 're doing the laundry . How much does she want ? That 's not money anymore . You must return something that belongs to her . What ? Something that was taken from the casino last night . By your colleagues in Fraud . A mother of pearl lacquer box that belonged to her father . I can 't do that , it 's evidence . Its contents are valued treasures , Harry , and ... you owe her . She has some serious people behind her now , who are very ... unsentimental in the way they work . What does that mean , Kaleem ? You 're a family man . So , when she 's gonna give us this footage ? She may want to use it as a bargaining chip ... with us , now Fraud have her in for money-laundering . - Is she guilty ? - I don 't know . But we may have to make a deal with the devil if we want Clayton . For the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them ... make haste . You 're alright , Harry ? Oh , hi . What can I do for you ? Yeah , I have a question ... It 's a hangover from the investigation of the Freddie Lau 's murder . Shoot . How many roulette tables were stacked ? Only one . I 'll show you . - This one here wasn 't rigged ? Just found one device . Alright ? - Harry . - I thought you 'd left for the evening . - Likewise . What 's that ? It 's a promissory note . Tim Larson owed Lily-Anne money : 110,000 Pounds . I think this is enough to prove that she ordered the hit on Caleb Pursey . How did you find this ? You took this from Fraud 's evidence room . We can nail Lily-Anne with this . I don 't know if I can trust you anymore . Suri , we 're both fighting on the same side . But the people we 're fighting don 't play fair so , sometimes , one of us has to fight dirty . Listen ... You take it . You decide what we do with it . Lily-Anne Lau , I 'm further arresting you on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Caleb Pursey . Where 's your partner ? - You do not have to say anything . - I know you 're doing this for him . I 'm doing it because you 're guilty . Where have you been ? I 've been busy . What did you do with Becker 's body ? It 's safer if you don 't know . What ? I 'll just accept that ? What other choices do you have ? What 's that ? I told you before that I knew you . You didn 't believe me . This is my mother 's Medicaid 's file . You were one of the detectives on it . My mother was Maria Alexandri . I shouldn 't have done this to you . I 'm sorry . Do they really have to look me in the eye when they kill me ? No , I just made that up . Get some sleep , Harry . What did he want ? A package for the boss . - I 'll take it to Winter . - - -

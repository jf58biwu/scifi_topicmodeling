 ( CAMERA CLICKS ) - Do you know who that is ? - No . - You don 't think Harry did this ? - I don 't think anything yet . But you know Harry 's involved in something . You 're the one who brought me the casino tape . Never underestimate what a desperate man will do . - Have you ever seen anything like this ? - SURI : Never . Who made the call to MIS ? It was source-led . The important thing now is where 's Harry ? Speak of the devil . What 's going on ? What are you doing with a man 's head in your freezer , Harry ? ANNA : No , I really do have to go . Will you come back tonight ? I don 't know . Maybe . ( PHONE RINGS ) Suri , is everything alright ? Anna , we arrested Harry last night . What ? What for ? For murder . For murder ? That 's insane . I thought you should know straight away . We 're about to interview him . With a duty solicitor ? SURF . Yes . OK , thanks . Thanks for calling me . - Is it Harry ? - Yes . Can you get me a taxi ? Sure . Can you identify the man in this photograph ? I believe this is the man that kidnapped Kate Olsen , and tried to kill her . And do you know this man 's name ? Becker . Um ... I think ... I think his name 's Becker . WINTER : How do you know that he kidnapped Olsen ? He was there the night we found her at the docks . WINTER : I don 't remember any description of this man from your report . Could somebody fetch that for me ? The container where Kate Olsen was held was being loaded onto a lorry . I chased the fork-lift driver between the container stacks and that 's when this man appeared from nowhere and assaulted me . What happened next ? When I came to , they were gone . DS Chohan and DI Orwell were both present at the docks . Did either of them see this man - or witness him assaulting you ? - No . Chohan and Orwell were both inside the container with Olsen . Thanks . This man is not in his report So , Canary Docks was the first time you saw this man , Becker ? Yes . The first and last time . WINTER : Our officers were unable to find you at the docks that night . They made several attempts to contact you , but you were off radar for 12 hours . I 'd been knocked unconscious . You know , I was disorientated . When I got up , I ... I drove away . I was shattered , so I stopped , and I slept in the car . And my radio was off . Forensics believe this man died three weeks ago . That 's about the same time as Canary Docks . I didn 't do this , Alistair . He 's lying . Did you have anything to do with this man 's death , Harry ? No . Who told you to look inside my freezer ? ( WINTER CHUCKLES ) You know I won 't be answering that question . Look , I 'm a murder detective . If I was going to kill someone , do you not think I would do a better job than store his head in my freezer ? I 'm being set up . The same way my brother was . I 'm being targeted by Golding because I got too close to him . I 've just recovered some evidence . A set of overalls , belonging to Charles Collins . I am sure it will place him at the scene of Barbara Haleton 's murder . You 're not a detective at present , Harry . It 's in the bag I gave to DS Chohan on my arrest . Please , Alistair , test it . It will prove my brother 's innocence and lead us to Golding . - Interview suspended at 0615 . - What ? No . Wait , listen . What are you ... ? Alistair ? A murder case I was involved in a long time ago . Maria Alexandri . Pull up that case . That will show where it all started involving Frierson . Maria Alexandri ! He 's clearly lying about what happened between him and this dead man . You were on Olsen . - Did you come across this man , Becker ? - No . Do you believe Harry 's story that he might have kidnapped Olsen ? If this man did kidnap her , I don 't know why Harry never mentioned it to me before . - So you think he 's lying ? - Maybe . But I don 't know why . Because he 's a gambling addict with crushing debts , who 's already in up to his neck over this Lau murder . We need to check out his story about Becker . And send the evidence he 's claiming to have found to the lab . This bag evidence is a smokescreen . This is just Harry covering his tracks . We need to thoroughly check out his story . We need more than this to go to the CPS . I want to keep a 24-hour guard on Clayton 's flat . OK . No problem , sir . Hi , Mum . Listen , somethings come up . Can you hang on to Daisy for another couple of hours ? Yes . I won 't be long . OK , great . Thank you . Bye . - Alistair ! - Shit . Can you wait for me ? I 'll be five minutes . - Anna . So you 've heard about Harry . - What the hell 's going on ? Harry 's one of your own . I can 't talk about an ongoing investigation . - Cut the crap , Alistair ! - I have no choice . Harry isn 't capable of murder ! Look , Anna , I have to get back to work . Isn 't it a coincidence that his own brother was set up on a murder charge days ago ? We charged Richard based on ... Listen , I 'm trying to stop you making the same mistake again . Harry has been investigating a very serious criminal called Golding . You don 't think he could conceivably have set all this up ? I have no evidence that this man even exists - or has anything to do with this . - Well , he exists , OK ? The governor of Whitecross knows all about him . I 've had it first-hand from a prisoner . Why aren 't you looking into that ? It still doesn 't affect Harry 's case . I 'll see you later , Anna . FRIERSON : How 's the investigation into Clayton going ? ORWELL : I 'd say it was in the balance . Well , you know I was a detective myself , and I still maintain some of my contacts from that time . - Informants . - Why would you do that ? Well , my brief is to police the police . The best way to do that is to understand what 's really happening out there . From all sides . I 've had some information . From one of my old sources . Well , from what I hear , this Becker was a nasty piece of work . He had a personal grudge against Clayton . And Harry took the necessary action . I need physical evidence . Something more substantial to take to the CPS . I might have something for you . ORWELL : Chohan , it 's Orwell . We 've had an anonymous message call . A headless body discovered on the Victoria Canal near Angel . I 'm heading there now . Call me back . - Is it our guy ? - Yes , sir . OFFICER : We found this next to the body . Bag it . So , Harry 's prints were on the knife ? Yeah . And blood . They 're just running a DNA comparison on Becker . Cause of death ? A single gunshot wound to the chest . The head was removed postmortem . Also ... we found this in his pocket . Harry and Anna 's old address . It doesn 't strike you as odd that we 've had two tip-offs in the space of 24 hours ? Yeah , there 's ... there 's no doubt someone is ... screwing Harry over , but we have more than enough to charge him . Harry is lying about Becker , OK ? They have a history that goes way beyond Kate Olsen 's kidnapping . Yeah . Well , he 'll be remanded in custody , just like his brother . HARRY : ls the evidence from Collins 's bag being analyzed ? Yes . Harry ? - They 're going to charge me . - SURI : Yeah . I know . - OFFICER : Come on , sir . - I still have faith in you , Suri . Suri , we 've just had a message from Saint Francis Hospital . Kate Olsen has woken up . Said you can talk to her tomorrow morning . ( EXHALES ) OFFICER : Come on , sir . I understand . I 'm just not sure it 's a good idea for the firm or for you to get involved in this . Harry needs somebody who can get these allegations thrown out , and that 's you . Can I ask you a difficult question ? ( EXHALES ) Yes . Are you sure about Harry ? ( SIGHS ) - Are you sure he 's not capable ... ? - Don 't be ridiculous ! This is Harry ! Of course he 's not capable of this . OK . - Let me give it some consideration . - Thank you . It means a lot . OK . ( RAUCOUS CHATTER ) ( WHISPERS ) Watch your back . He 's making good progress . Don 't let him slip . Anna . Nikhal , I don 't want to ask you this , but I have to see Harry . I can 't pull favors for you here . I put in my application , but they said I can 't see him till next week . That 's fine , John . Thank you . I understand this is difficult for you . But the police wouldn 't have charged him if they didn 't actually think he did it . The evidence has obviously been planted . It shouldn 't even have gone this far . Are you sure you need to see him ? Yes . - I 'm sorry ... - I 'll try and get you in today . Thank you . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) MAN : ... to pieces . Do you understand me , eh ? ( WHISPERS ) Rich ? Harry . Come here . - Oh , Jesus Christ . - It 's OK , it 's OK . No , it 's not . No , it 's not . We are dead . - What have they done to you ? - It 's not happened yet . What ? They keep telling me they 're going to break me apart I 've got strangers coming up to me in corridors and whispering that my days are numbered . - Nothing 's gonna happen . I 'm here now . - Yeah , they told me you were coming . Why are you in here ? The same reason as you . Framed for murder . - So I 'm never getting out of here . - ( BELL ) Rich ... Rich . Listen , you just need to hold it together . - Things are going to turn around . - ( CHUCKLES ) Right , back to your cells ! Come on ! Let 's get a move on ! Who told you that ? Your lucky bracelet ? Hasn 't been very lucky for me , has it ? Or Barbara . See , DCI Frierson and DI Jim Stepton are shown here on surveillance logs at 43 Chepstow Road . But then , there 's nothing . It just ... It stops . Well , there 's nothing more in here about that . Or anything else . Maybe it was taken out of the docket . You think some papers have been removed deliberately ? Well , that 's what I 'm trying to find out . If anything came from this surveillance operation . I 'll make sure that things haven 't been ... misfiled . - I 'm here to see Kate Olsen . - She 's right up there . You 're sure he 's the one ? Yeah . Becker . - He 's definitely dead ? - Yes . Kate , I 'm sure you 're still hazy on the details ... He was asking about Lermontov . Do you think Becker was hired by Vincent 's son , Paul ? Yeah . I was on a ... a barge and then ... and then I was in the Lermontov vaults . Do you know where these vaults are ? She needs to rest now . Yes , of course . I 'm sorry . Thank you . She 's sleeping now . Perhaps you could come back later ? Sure . ( MACHINE BEEPS ) SURI : Nurse , nurse ! Kate , can you hear me ? Kate ! Kate ! Excuse me . NURSE : What 's going on with her ? BP 's 180 over 90 . I don 't know why . It 's still rising . She 's going into cardiac arrest . She 's crashing . That machine 's broken . It 's been broken for weeks , Detective . - ( MACHINE WHIRS ) - Really ? It seems fine to me . Have you still got it ? The bracelet ? Yes . Why don 't you use it to try and get out ? Because my brother is in here . Listen , what 's going on here ? In the yard ? Who runs that gang you were with ? There 's no gang in here . My brother is under serious threat here . I want to know who from . You don 't get it . It 's not a gang . Everybody 's pan of it . What ? And if you don 't join or you ... you can 't join ... Everyone in the whole prison 's involved ? It 's impossible . Golding ? - I 've got to get back . - Tim , please . Listen to me . - My brother 's life is on the line . - Let him go . Remember me ? Hatton Garden . Oh , yeah . I remember smacking you in the face . You went down like a sack of shite . And now you 're here washing my pants . You 're a long way from home , Detective . There 's 330 prisoners on the remand wing . 16 prison officers . And two Claytons . You have a think about that , Harry . The forensic on the overalls . Thanks . Come with me . Rich ? Get here . Where 's my brother ? It 's OK . We 've been here before , remember ? ( CUTTER WHIRS ) ( GROANS ) Jesus ! - ( YELLS ) - PRISONER : Let 's get out of here . ( ALARM ) Harry ! Harry , I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! Be careful ! She was pretty sure Paul Lermontov hired Becker . We should put him under surveillance straight away . Alright . Do an urgent surveillance application . Let 's get it approved ASAP . Any results on the overalls Harry brought in ? Not yet . If Barbara Haleton 's blood is on those overalls , - we 've made a terrible mistake . - You did your job . I 've been through every decision we 've made . Sir ? What happened with you and Harry in Rotherhithe ? Harry led us into an ambush . With a psychopath . He gambled on him being unarmed . And he was wrong . Whatever I feel ... about Harry , it hasn 't influenced any decision I 've made on this . GUARD : Clayton , you have a visitor . GUARD : Five minutes . I know you didn 't do it . Thank you . You shouldn 't be here . I 'm getting you a better lawyer . - It won 't make much difference . - Of course it will . Harry , what 's going on ? Why is this happening ? I got too close . - Golding ? - Listen to me . You have to be very careful . He 's done this to me . He 's done it to Rich . - Have you seen Rich ? - Yeah . There 's a gang in here . It 's controlled my Golding . They 've somehow got to Rich . I don 't quite understand , but he 's really vulnerable . How did you get to see me so soon ? Julian ? Listen , I need you to ask him to offer Rich a Rule 43 . He needs to be separated from the rest of those people . - Do this straight away . - Alright . I 'll ask him . And what about you ? I 'm OK . Yeah , you 're obviously fine ! I can handle myself . I know you can . What shall I say to Daisy ? Nothing . - ( DOOR OPENS ) - Time 's up . I will find a way to get you out . I 'm sorry , Anna . ( SIGHS ) Kaleem . I 've got a job for you . Come by tomorrow . Before we open for business . ( EXHALES ) SURI : DS Chohan to Control . Paul Lermontov is leaving the Needle Building . He said there 's a gang operating inside the prison . I 'm afraid that 's the case with all the prisons in London . We 're trying to break it down , but my officers are assaulted almost every week , so the good ones keep leaving . I thought the whole point was this prison was a flagship success . My outreach programs are a success , but they 're under constant threat . Someone very powerful , someone with political influence , is controlling this gang from the outside . All we get in here are lieutenants and foot soldiers . We 're stretched just trying keep up with who 's in on it . Harry wants Rich to be given a Rule 43 . He thinks he 's being targeted . It doesn 't work like that . It has to come from our side . Look , I think Harry 's also in danger . I can 't just abandon all prison procedure just because we 're together . You know that 's why I let you see him . My guards know that it 's completely against the rules . Yes , I realize that . Let me think about it , Anna . Thank you . Why don 't you come and see me tomorrow ? We can talk it through then . - I have to be with Daisy tomorrow . - So bring Daisy . I 'm spending the weekend with friends in Hampstead . They 've got a daughter her age . They 'll have fun . There 's a pool . Alright . I 'll ... I 'll see if she 's OK with it . How long were you planning on sitting on this ? - Excuse me , sir ? - The analysis for Collins 's overalls . This places Collins at the crime scene . I was waiting for confirmation of its admissibility . Clayton was suspended the morning ... That isn 't your call ! ORWELL : With all due respect , sir , I was SIO on the Richard Clayton case . How do we know Harry didn 't tamper with this ? We don 't , but this raises serious questions . Our case against Richard Clayton wasn 't that strong . - When did this come in ? - This morning . ( SIGHS ) We have to get Rich released . Come with me , Chohan . WINTER : I need to get this release order to Whitecross ASAP . - Where are you at with Lermontov ? - SURI : We lost him in traffic . If Harry was right about Collins , then how far does this go ? ( SIGHS ) Harry came to me , begging for surveillance on Collins , just before we got the tip-off about his flat . - You didn 't agree ? - I thought he was in over his head . And you 'd just given me the casino tape . We know that Collins is involved in at least two of these cases that we 're investigating . Barbara Haleton , and you saw him with Sasha Terekhova . He was on her boat acting like her chaperone . We 've connected a series of crimes and the killer is still out there . What about Frierson ? We need to sit on him until we 're absolutely sure . About what ? How deeply he 's involved in this . You think he might be Golding . I 'll get back onto Lermontov . Why do you think Orwell sat on Rich 's release ? I don 't know . GUARD : OK , ladies , let 's have you back your cells ! Come on ! Let 's hurry up ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Hey , in ! No messing around , girls . Let 's have you back . It 's bedtime . - Have you seen my brother ? - Get back to your cell , Clayton . Or it 's two days ' lockdown . Come on . Chop chop . Time to turn your light out , Daise . Am I going to Dad 's tomorrow ? No . He 's had to go away . Where to ? I 'll tell you about it tomorrow . Where am I going instead ? We 've both been invited to spend the day with Nikhal . He 's got a pool . It 'll be fun . Great . Night , sweetheart Mr Linton , this is Detective Superintendent Winter . Oh , yes . Did you show Dr Marghai the photographs I sent over for identification ? Yes , I did . Did he identify Karl Frierson as the recipient of Luke Bangura 's kidney ? Detective Superintendent , can you guarantee my client protection from these people ? Mr Linton , this is crucial . OK . If you arrest Frierson , then I 'm pretty sure my client will testify against him . We just received this . It 's a release order for Richard Clayton . We need to action it straight away . OK . I 'll get him ready . Marghai is going to stand up in court and say he got the kidney for Frierson . You see , Harry was convinced Maria Alexandri 's case is where Frierson was turned . I 've been looking into it . There was a cover-up . Files are missing . A Maria Alexandri was ... She was pan of the traveler community . Why would Golding and Frierson go to so much trouble over someone like her ? - We need Harry here . - Yeah . Well , we 're not going to get him out until we get close to this man . Lily-Anne . You look well . No , I don 't . Well , even on your bad days , you look better than the rest of us . ( SIGHS ) Are you getting the carpet cleaned ? It 's expensive carpet . - Is this what I think it is ? - I 'm sorry , Kaleem . But I 've been given no choice . We all have a choice . Your father had a choice . My father was a very stubborn man . So was my father , but I didn 't throw him to the wolves for it . ( TUTS ) I expect Golding will want video evidence that you 've done this yourself . You 've been talking to Harry Clayton . That 's why you have to die . Harry Clayton is finished . Why do I have to die for someone who won 't even make it to the end of the week ? If I disobey this order ... then I 'm next on the hit list . ( sum COCKS ) And they 'll get you anyway . Think . Lily-Anne , think what this can do to your conscience . I have no conscience left . Do you have a message for your father ? You were right about that surveillance operation on 43 Chepstow Road . They brought in a suspect for questioning . Twice . - Twice ? - A week apart So , it had been removed from the original case file ? And it would have stayed buried if you 'd not made me cross-check the station records . It took me two days to access that . I hope it 's worth it . Thanks . Right , you need to leave there now . Meet me at City Hall . We haven 't got much time . I think I know who Golding is . Oi . Have you seen my brother ? He 's missing . Yeah , that can happen in Whitecross . Here today , gone tomorrow . Have you harmed him ? Us ? No . We haven 't touched him . You threatened him . We 're just the foot soldiers here . The real power is over there . Maybe you should ask them if Rich got the Rule 43 . Just like you asked for . - Where 's my brother ? - He 's been ill . But he 's back in his cell now . And he 's been asking for you . Come on . Come with us . Come on . Come on . WINTER : Frierson tampered with the Maria Alexandri files to cover up who really killed her . SURI : This should be interesting . WINTER : Hello , Karl . What are you doing here , Alistair ? Maria Alexandri . Remember her , Karl ? You were investigating her murder with DI Jim Stepton . The traveler woman . Stabbed in her caravan . What has that got to do with anything ? I cross-checked our station custody records on the Alexandri case . See , some of the pages were missing from the original case file . And I just couldn 't work it out . Fortunately our extremely diligent archive officer found these . Go on . Go on . SURI : You and DI Jim Stepton brought in Nikhal Julian for questioning about the murder of Maria Alexandri . You interviewed him twice . What about it ? WINTER : A key witness places him walking away from Maria Alexandri 's caravan on the night of that murder . And yet you and DI Stepton didn 't follow this up . Within a week , Stepton retires , and the case is left unsolved . ( GROANS ) Rich ? WINTER : And that 's when Julian bought you , isn 't it ? For the price of a kidney . And slickly repackaged you as his perfect inside man at City Hall . What the hell are you talking about ? This is completely ridiculous . HARRY : Rich ! Rich ! Hey , Rich ! Open the door ! Open the door ! Rich ! ( BONES CRACK / RICH SCREAMS ) Rich ! Rich ! I 'm gonna kill you ! WINTER : Karl Frierson , I 'm arresting you on suspicion of soliciting to murder Luke Bangura , and perverting the course of justice . Come on , Karl . You 've been in my seat before . You must know there 's nowhere to hide . We 're gonna access your medical records and every piece of correspondence between you and Governor Julian , because that 's who we 're talking about , isn 't it , Kari ? ( SLOWED DOWN ) Julian ! Julian ! No !

 Peace Long ago before the founders established this great city of ours that word was all but meaningless , an ideal as elusive as a dream . Now , 200 years later . We are all of us living proof that peace is indeed attainable . The reason for this is of course our faction system . Erudite , Dauntless , Amity , Candor , Abnegation . In dividing people according to personality and aptitude we 've created a society in which each faction plays a critical role in maintaining the social order . But this harmony we achieved is now under attack from a small but extremely dangerous group of individuals . We call them " Divergents " . They are in essence the worst of what humanity used to be rebellious , defiant and uncontrollable . Five days ago , a rogue group of divergents posing as Dauntless brutely invaded Abnegation in an obvious attempt to cripple the faction system by attacking it 's most vulnerable members . These divergents despise our system because they are incapable of conforming to it . These latest rumours for example that I was somehow behind the attack on Abnegation ... nothing more that Divergent propaganda . I am devoting myself to bringing these fugitives to justice . I 've exercised my right as acting council leader to declare martial law until I 'm confident that any threat to our security has been eliminated . Tell Jeanine we got it . We are all that 's left of humanity . The vast wall that encloses this city may protect us from our toxic surroundings , but it is up to us to confront any element that can poison us from within . Because when you are civilization 's last hope , peace is not merely an ideal it is an obligation . And it is up to all us to take a stand position against it 's one true enemy . Divergents Amity ! We need to make sure it 's clear . Tris ! Help us , please help us , please ! Please help us , you have to help us ! I 'm sorry , you have to leave . - You just don 't belong here . - It 's all her fault . You killed Will . No ... She killed ... Father ! ... Mother ! You killed us all . - And ... three ! - Higher ! - Hey - Higher , higher ! - You wanna go higher . Okay everyone back to classes now I just wanted to do something different . Yeah . Well that 's definitely different . - You don 't like it ? - No , I like it , I like it a lot I 'm just surprised , that 's all . - What 's going on , Tris ? - Nothing . I 'm fine . Just ... Still having nightmares ? No . We 're good . You and me . I know nothing else is , but we are . Time for chores . How much longer do we have to stay here for ? Until we know it 's safe to leave . - Hey . - Hey . Son ! You can 't ignore me forever . I know you 're thinking about your next move , but there are things you don 't know . Marcus , please just leave us alone . Your mother didn 't come back to Abnegation just to save you . She died trying to hide something from Jeanine , something that was entrusted to Abnegation - a long time ago . - Marcus ! Stop ! Whatever you want from us , you 're not gonna get it . I 'm not the enemy here . You found it . It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior , like you said . You mind telling me what 's inside ? A message from the Founders that will ensure the future our people deserve . Divergents will destroy our society , unless we destroy them . And now we can . However , only a Divergent can open this box . Find them ! Every last one of them . Go with happiness . Go with happiness . - Go with happiness . - Thank you . Go with happiness . I really don 't know how much longer I can do this whole peace and love thing . It 's the Amity way , just try to blend in . I 'm trying to blend in , it 's just not working . Coming through , on you right . Okay here we go . Oh look a rainbow . It 's pretty . Virtual pathological friendliness with unquestioning passifism . I love this place . Thank you . Go with happiness . Oops , excuse me . Hey Tris , I really like your hair by the way . Did you try to cut it all short and weird like that . Peter , why don 't you take your food and sit down huh ? Or what ? Besides I think we all should stick together now that we are officially fugitives . Wait what do you mean by officially fugitives ? Oh you don 't know ? You didn 't tell Caleb ? Yes , now Jeanine is saying that the attack on Abnegation was orchestrated by a group of regenade Divergents and their sympathizers . So they 're blaming this whole thing on us ? Yeah . And Jeanine needed a reason to petition the council to institute martial law . And now she has one . Staying here at Amity is our best option for now . We need to keep an ear to the ground and find out where the rest of Dauntless are . - Then we can make a move . - We need to kill Jeanine . I know , we 're not ready yet . - Beatrice you 're not being serious , right ? - No I am being serious .. I 'm not gonna stop until she 's dead . Tris you can 't just go around killing people . No she 's right , listen to your sister . Tris , I think you should go to Erudite and kill Jeanine yourself . I 'll stay with Caleb so you don 't get him killed too . What ? Come on , you know ... like you did your parents . Stop ! What do you think you 're doing ? - My office ! Now ! Enjoy your meal everyone , enjoy your meal . Just calm down . Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included non violence ? Well I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again . Be that as it may , you can no longer stay here with us . Your presence is just too disruptive . Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways . Was it ? With you not standing up to Jeanine . - You don 't understand us at all . - No I do understand you . I understand that you think you can stay out of this but you can 't . One day she 's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna take whatever power you think you have away from you . Tris ! Tris ! Look , Johanna , we need a little more time . I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are , then we can leave . And then what ? Attack Erudite ? - I will not be a party to violence . - No-one 's asking you to . We just need a few more days . One . - One , what ? - One more chance . See , to be Amity is to forgive others and yourself . You 're hurting Tris . And my heart goes out to you . I know what it 's like to stand helpless while you lose the ones you love . But killing Jeanine is not gonna bring your mother back . I know you 're angry , but you 're letting it consume you . What is it ? Stay here and keep quiet . Gentlemen , Amity welcomes you . - To what do we owe the pleasure . - This isn 't really a social call Johanna . - We 're looking for Divergents . - I see . Well of course , anything we can do to help . We need you to volunteer your faction to be tested . New screening technology from Erudite . Amity . Not that Jeanine is heading up yo the council the approval process just got a little easier . - You 're exceeding your jurisdiction . - Now , Johanna . What happened to that Amity politeness . The easy way , or the hard way ? It 's up to you . Alright , but under protest . Okay we 're good to go ! Move it out ! All Amity report to the dome for new mandatory testing . Okay lets go , get inside ! You know something lady ? You seem awfully stuck in that doorway . Eric 's here . We need to move now , come on . - What 's up there ? - Just my office . There 's two guards with guns . We 're going out the window ? We need to split up . okay , yeah . Every man for himself . Good . Hey , they 're up here ! Hey , they 're up here ! Come on they 're getting away ! You 're ready ? - Where ? - Out the window ! I got three on foot making a break towards the dome ! - Got one ! - Repeat , three on foot toward the dome . Over there ! - I demand amnesty ! - Get down now ! I believe in Abignation , it 's my right ! - Detain him ! - Let 's go ! Come on , keep moving ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! - Listen ! - What ? A train ! Go , go , go ! Caleb ! Keep moving . Ammo ! Come on , move . - Go , go ! - Caleb ! Move ! Oh you folks sure know how to make an entrance ! - Factionless . - Amity . Oh , you staring like Dauntless . I have no idea what this one is . - Look , we just need to get to the city , that 's all . - Well too bad , the train 's taken . And you damaged our cargo . These are Abnegation and you are factionless right ? - Caleb ! - I used to be Abnegation . We used to use the same bolts to make clothes for you . Are you saying that we stealing from you ? No no , I 'm no longer Abnegation , so technically you 're not stealing from me . No , you 're not stealing at all . It 's a question of semantics I suppose whether it 's stealing or charity . - But it 's all really the same . - That 's enough ! Everybody relax alright . You 've made your point . - We 'll get off your train alright . - Got you , would everybody just relax ? Why don 't we take a seat ? - I was just trying to help ! - Don 't . Yeah , this is going to be fun . Everybody just calm down alright ? Caleb . Get off ! Get off ! - You alright ? - Yup . Are you okay ? - Tobias Eaton . - You say that again . Tobias Eaton . What you know him ? I am him . We have been looking for you . What are they talking about ? Four ? Follow me . Tris ! I 'm sorry , I wanted to help . Four ! Four ! Why are they looking for you ? How do they know your your name ? This is factionless . This is insane . Tobias ! Mother . I thought she was dead . Me too . Somebody please tell me what 's going on here . Tobias 's father was very abusive . I knew that the only way I could ever truly escape him was ... to disappear completely . Abnegation helped me fake my death . Anything to protect Marcus 's image . But you just left him there alone with Marcus . I was very young . I reached out to him about a year ago . I felt it was finally time to reconnect . - I 'm still your mother . - No , my mother is dead . I went to her funeral when I was six . And she wasn 't trying to reconnect with me . She was trying to use me . Like you are now . Why ? She wants an army . - An army ? - I want an alliance . - No , what you want is revenge ! - This isn 't about me . It 's about putting an end to a system that says one group is more deserving than another . This city may be surrounded by a wall but it doesn 't have to be a prison . I think that 's a bit extreme . I mean , the faction system isn 't perfect , but it 's hardly a prison . Let me guess , you 're Erudite ? I was Erudite . - Are you willing to kill Jeanine ? - Absolutely . When I was married to Marcus I knew her well . And believe me , there 's nothing she isn 't capable of . - But I think you already know that . - Tris , you can 't trust her . - Maybe she knows ... - We 're on the same side , Tris . I 'm factionless because I don 't fit in any one faction . And you 're Divergent because you belong to too many .. But we are both a threat to Jeanine . My people are ready for war if that 's what it takes . And then what ? - We depose those in power . - And once you 've done that ? Once you killed Jeanine , who 's in power then ? You see , that 's the part she always conveniently leaves out . Don 't tell me this isn 't about you , this is only about you . I know where the remaining Dauntless are hiding . - Where ? - They took shelter in Candor . As far as I know they 're still there . Think about it . If we were to combine forces , Dauntless and Factionless , we 'd be unstoppable . That 's not gonna happen . Thank you for your hospitality , but we 'll be leaving in the morning . Four , maybe this is ... Tobias , please reconsider . Don 't you call me that . My name 's Four . You want to tuck him in or should I ? This meal looks lovely . Thank you . I 'm sorry . I should 've told you about her . No more secrets . Okay ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to wake you . I always loved watching him sleep . I take it you 're setting out for Candor in the morning ? Yeah . Listen , I only want what 's best for him . You hardly even know him . You 'd like to think that wouldn 't you ? But deep down I think you 're scared I know him all too well . - I 'm not scared . - Of course you are . You 're scared that he 'll finally see you for what you really are . Deadly . You don 't believe me ? Ask him . Are you okay ? Yeah . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . - I 'm not coming with you guys . - What ? To Candor . I 'm not going with you guys . - What are you talking about ? - What 's your plan ? You guys are gonna find the rest of the Dauntless , then what ? You attack Erudite ? Assasinate Jeanine , start a civil war ? I 'm sorry , I 'm just not cut out for that . I 'm not like you guys . I need to get back to Abnegation maybe . Sort out what our parents left behind . Maybe I can be useful there . Caleb , there 's nothing left in Abnegation . Yeah . - You okay ? - Just need to get to Candor . Tris ! I know you think Caleb is your responsibility but he made his own choice . You can 't protect everyone . - I can 't protect anyone . - Nobody can . Him leaving isn 't your fault . None of this is your fault . Johanna was right . You have to forgive yourself . Thank you . We gotta move . - We found them ! - Yeah . - Damn it 's good to see you guys . - Are you alright ? I 'm better now . I 'm not exactly built for laying low . - Tris ! - Christina ! - It 's so good to see you . - You too . Have you heard anything about Will ? - No . - Nothing ? No . Something must have happened to him . He would 've found me by now you know . - Hey . - Hey . How are you holding up ? - How many Dauntless do we have ? - 175 total . - 175 ? That 's it ? - The rest followed Max . - Not near the numbers we need . Hold it ! Grab their guns ! - Hey , they 're with us . - We know who you are . Last warning . Drop your guns . Alright . Easy . - I 'm Jack Kang , I 'm leadership here . - We know who you are . We 're not a threat to Candor . That might be your truth , it 's not neccesarily mine . All I know for certain is you are both wanted for criminal insurgency and conspiring in the attack on Abnegation . Those are lies . If you were Candor I would take you at your word . Unfortunately given the circumstances I 'm obliged to hand you over to the council . - You can make your case there . - You might as well just kill us now . If Jeanine finds us , we 're not gonna live to stand trial . I doubt that very much . She would never supersede the council . Are you sure about that ? Who 's gonna stop her ? You ? Factional law must be upheld . No , wait wait wait . Can I ask you one question ? Can I ask you one question ? Jeanine believes that Erudite are most fit to govern because they are the smartest . You believe Candor is the most fit to judge because you are so honest ? I admit , I do hold that belief . Then , would you say I trial held here at Candor would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite ? The answer is yes . In my opinion a Candor trial would have the greatest chance of achieving true justice . So you are asking me to petition council to grant Candor sole judiciary power ? No . As part of Candor 's initation you administer a truth serum . Correct ? We don 't technically discuss such matters out of faction . - That 's a pretty evasive answer . - Evasion is not dishonesty . But it 's not exactly honest either . - Yes , we possess such a serum . - Then use it on us . Four ! If we are guilty , we 'll surrender to the council . If not , you just saved two lives . - And made some loyal allies . - Alright . But you should know the serum can be quite brutal . It was designed for Candor applicants who are already predisposed to honesty . Not everyone finds it so easy to share their secrets . - I don 't want to do this . - We have to . Neither of us have secrets worth dying for . May the truth set you free . Tobias Eaton . You are accused of conspiring with your fellow Dauntless in the attack on Abnegation . Is this true ? Conspiring no . But I did attack . I was in simulation controlled by Jeanine and the rest of the Dauntless that she had recruited . Tris found me . She managed to break me free from the simulation and together we fought our way out . So you are saying that Jeanine orchestrated this attack ? Yes . One last thing . If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless , why didn 't you just leave ? Why did you stay ? I wanted to leave . But I fell in love with Tris Prior . And I couldn 't leave her . Thank you for your Candor . Thank you for your Candor . Tobias Eaton , this trial has concluded and you are absolved of guilt on the attack on Abnegation . Miss Prior if you would . May the truth set you free . Tris Prior . Mr Eaton said you managed to free him from the sim . Yes . So you were never under the simulation yourself . No . How is that possible ? Because I 'm Divergent . I see . So you never harmed any of your fellow Dauntless or the Abnegation ? I did . Who ? My mom . I watched her die first and then my dad . They were killed trying to save me . Miss Prior , the more you resist , the more painful the serum will be . My friend ... I killed my friend . He was trying to shoot me . And ... I shot him first . What was his name ? What was his name ? Will . I killed Will . This is what happens to people that get close to me . They get hurt or they die . I can 't forgive myself . Thank you for your Candor . Thank you for your Candor . Tris ! I 'm sorry . I told you I didn 't want to do that . - Christina . - Go . Go . Abnegation sim complete . Dauntless sim initiated . Mam , the Divergent 's viatals are dropping . If we don 't pull her out of the sim soon we 'll lose her . You stop when I say so . She 's gonna do it . She 's gonna pass the sim . Dauntless sim failed . Divergent test subject six is no longer viable . Alright shut it down . We are wasting our time . I 've been assuming all Divergents are the same . But some are stronger than others . Assign all non essential personnel to the Divergent detail . We need to work harder . We need to find that very special one . Where 's your scary boyfriend ? Probably out doing scary boyfriend things . Mind if I join you ? I love heights . From up here everything seems much smaller , you know . I know it sounds crazy , but ... Sometimes I think I see lights out beyond the wall . I know they say its all just wasteland out there but ... We can 't be the only ones left . Can we ? All 's clear , moving down ! Mommy ! Mommy ! - There 's a thing here - I 've got one too See ? It 's okay . It 's just a thing that made everyone go to sleep . Okay , I need you to do me a favour . I need you to go to the top of the stairs up there and don 't come down until your mommy comes to get you . Don 't come down . Can you do that ? Be brave , okay ? Go . Hey ! Why are we the only ones awake ? Because we 're Divergents . Come on , I need your help to open this . I need your help . Hey ! Look who decided to show up . It 's really good to see you again . Alright folks , nothing to be nervous about . It 's a little routine inspection , then we all go back to our business . Hello . Divergent 10 % . Shit . You 're almost normal . That 's boring . That is not part of the mission . So what ? As far as I 'm concerned the rest of them are still outlaws . Let 's just wrap this up quickly . The others are gonna be awake soon . - Hi , sweetie . - I should not ... - Divergent 40 % . - I 'm afraid it 's not you either . The lady said that I should not ... The lady said that I shouldn 't have come downstairs . Maybe you should have listened . Enough ! You still have to test her . Jeanine told us that we have to test everyone . - Divergent 100 % . - I 'll be damned . - What ? - She 's what we 've been looking for . Bullshit . Divergent 100 % . Get her in a veichle . I 'll alert Jeanine . If you think you got lucky , you 're wrong . You gonna wish I killed you . Drop your weapons ! Thank you . It 's lucky you got that gun , Four . We both know you 're never much without one . You think she 's safe now ? You 're wrong . Jeanine 's never gonna stop searching for you . Why ? What she want with her ? Tell me ! Look all I know is that she 's exactly what Jeanine needs . She 's the perfect subject . Is that supposed to scare me ? You 're responsible for the death of hundreds of people . You know the punishment for that . Listen ... I found a way to live with the blood on my hands , but can you ? Why won 't they come out ? All I know is that they put me into a sleeping sim and when I woke all hell was breaking loose . Heck , don 't play with it . You all know what this means . Thank you . - For helping us . - I wish I could do more . I had no idea Jeanine was capable of something like this . It 's time we fight back . - We don 't have the numbers . - We will . Once we get the Factionless . You heard Eric . Jeanine is never gonna stop coming after you . It 's our only option . Tris Prior . Of course . It had to be her . - Is she still off the grid ? - Yeah . But I think I found a solution . - It 's Peter , right ? - Yeah . Jeanine , can I just say it 's truly an honor to finally meet you in person . Congratulations mother . You got your war . - I know you wish there was another way . - But there isn 't . I 'm the lesser of two evils , is that it ? - It better be . - Tell me ... Why did you surrender to Erudite ? What do you want ? I would like a position in your regime . Ideally I would like a position with some advancement opportunities . I may be Dauntless but I 'm not just some meathead . No offense , Max . Prove your worth to us . Then we can discuss your ambitions . Great . When do I start ? Let 's talk about your friend Tris Prior . - How do I flush her out ? - It 's simple . The girl is a walking bleeding heart . She was born of Abegnation . It 's her weak spot . You just have to know how to press it . Help ! Come quick . Traitor Tris Prior must be surrendered to Erudite . Or every day more death will follow . Hand over Tris Prior . Or every day more death will follow . Hand over Tris Prior . Or every day more death will follow . Hand over Tris Prior . - Or every day more death will follow . - Christina ! No ! Christina ! Help me ! Tris ! We removed this from the body of the suicide . Marlene . Her name was Marlene . I 'm sorry . Marlene . It 's a very sophisticated sim serum injector . It also has a radio transmitter in it 's head . - How do we get them out ? - I don 't know . This tech was built to defend itself . This tendril ... wraps around the nearest major artery . If you try to removed them ... and it kills the host . Kill the host ? So what do we do ? Tori has to find a way to neutralize the disk before we do anything else . Or we can do the logical thing . We hand her over . Nobody knows about this alliance , we have to protect that advantage . If we hand Tris over now ... it might buy some time . I think it 's a good idea . But you have to go through me first . - Me too . - And all of us . I ain 't the one with a time bomb in my arm ! I know what you 're thinking . But I 'm not gonna let you do it . I can 't let anyone else die because of me . No one else is gonna die because of you . Tori 's going to find a way to disable the disk . - And if she doesn 't ? - Then ... If she doesn 't , we figure it out . Together . You know , I 'm just one person . - I 'm not worth it . - You are worth it . You are worth it to me . I love you . This city may be safe enclosed behind a vast wall , but make no mistake , that wall alone does not ensure our security . It is up to us , everyone of us , to remain vigilant , and to identify and isolate any potential threat to our stability . There are individuals hiding among us who must be contained . So permit me to address the objections of my fellow faction leaders . I am aware that there has been some concerns about the unavoidable raid on Candor so let me be clear . The harbouring of Divergents by any faction can not be tolerated . Very soon I will be presenting what I believe to be no less than a mandate from the founders themselves . and this will , I have no doubt , validate the measures I am taking to keep the peace . and provide the instructions that will allow us to eradicate the Divergent crisis once and for all . Where are you going ? Tris left . She 's gone . What ? When ? - Last night . - Wait . Tobias ! People look to you for leadership . You can 't just abandon them Tobias ! Wow ! I have to admit I 'm impressed . I mean , I knew that you were dumb but .. I didn 't think you were dumb enough to actually come down here and turn yourself in . These killings have to stop . Well that just goes to show that you can take the girl out of Abnigation but you can.t take Abnigation out of the girl . Let 's go . Once a stiff , always a stiff . Right ? - What is this ? - What is this ? This is the only reason that you are alive Tris . Man I love knowing stuff you don 't . I need you to open that box Tris . The only way to open that box is to pass the sims of all five factions . But the only people who have tried to do it so far have died . I don 't think I was supposed to tell you that . Oh well ... No pressure . Remarkable ! The chances of it being you of all people . Nearly defies the laws of probability . As remarkable as many people you managed to murder ? Dark times call for extrme measures . You may find it hard to believe . But I am serving the greater good . Step up on the disc please . Step up on the disc please . Mam ? Stop the suicides or I swear I will shoot him . That 's okay . You can kill him if you want , we have plenty of guards . What ? I 'm guesing you need me alive for this to work . Right ? Right ? ! Beatrice . Caleb . Caleb . Don 't engage the subject . Conditions are already less then optimal . If I do this the suicides stop ? No . The suicides will continue Until you succeed and pass all five sims . That should be incentive enough . Good luck . Let 's begin . Initializing Dauntless sim . Mom . Tris , help me ! Heart rate is rising . Keep her in play . Mom ! I 'm coming . Mom ! I 'm coming . Tris ! Hold on ! Tris . Dauntless sim complete . - I miss you so much . - I know you do . But I 'm still with you .. You need to be strong now . Tell me you 're gonna be strong . - I 'm trying . - You can do this . I know you can . You 're brave . Braver than anyone . I 'm not brave mom . I pretend that I am . I want people to think that I am , but I 'm not . I 'm really really scared ... that maybe we are actually what 's wrong in this world . Divergents . I never wanted any of this . You and dad and Caleb and Four . I can 't help but think that if I was normal we would all still be together . Mom , I don 't want to be Divergent anymore . I just want to feel safe again . Candor sim complete . Four . You 're here ? Yeah , I 'm here . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Secure the hallway . Let 's get you out of here . - You good ? - Yeah . Stop . Let him go . Wait , you 're not gonna shoot me ? Once a stiff , always a stiff . Go ! Four , how did you get passed security ? You know me , scary boyfriend skills . What is it ? You weren 't there . You didn 't even hear that . Tris , we need to leave now , alright ? I 'm sorry Four . - What ? - I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you I was gonna go . I wanted to say goodbye , but I just didnt know how . - I didn 't know how . - What are you talking about ? Even though I didn 't get to say it in real life , at least I get to say it now . - Even if it is just a sim . - Tris , we 're not in a sim . Don 't you think I would know if I were in a sim ? Four ... you 're not in a sim . - You are the sim . - Wait , wait . Erudite sim complete . - There 's only Amity now . - She hasn 't passed Abnegation yet . Yes she has . When she spared your life . This girl is extraordinary . She 's tested positive for four factions in one day . No one has gotten that far . We 've got a problem . She 's crashing . We have to rest her . Are you sure you 're not letting familial attachment cloud your judgement ? See for yourself . Very well . Detach the subject . Good work everyone . We will resume tomorrow . You were never planning on going back to Abnegation were you ? I had to do what I felt was right . Our parents would be ashamed of you . Well maybe not . I mean , well ... I am willing to sacrifice you , the only family I have left the only person that I love in order to preserve what 's best for everyone else . What 's more selfless than that ? What does Jeanine think is in that box Caleb ? It 's a message from the founders , but the box is to be opened only if the faction system broke down which is why it requires someone like you to open it . You are living proof that the Divergent problem has grown beyond all control . Do you even hear what you are saying right now ? No one think it 's your fault that you were born this way . Jeanine murdered an entire faction Caleb . That faction could no longer be trusted . She killed our parents . Our parents brought that on themselves . What are you talking about ? The box , it was in their house . They were the ones hiding it . All those lives could have been spared . It seems we didn 't knew our parents as well as we thought we did . Alright family reunion is over , it 's time to go . I got a little surprise for you Tris . - Four ! - Tris ! Tris ! Four ! I gather your brother explained how vital the work you 're doing here is to the future of the city . Please just let Four go . If his well being is of such a concern then you should focus on the task at hand . Tell me ... Do you appreciate irony ? You tested positive for Erudite so you must have the intellectual capacity . Irony . For instance . Right now you are filled with hate , but you need to pass an Amity sim . Then there are other ironies at work too . - Such as the fact your cherished mother ... - Don 't . That you so dauntlessly saved in the sim is the reason you 're in this mess to begin with . You 're the reason I 'm in this mess . And then there 's the most poignant irony of all . Stop . That Nathalie Prior not only died trying to protect the data that I now have .. - Because you stole it - in my possession , 814 01 : 28 : 05,963 - - 01 : 28 : 06,965 You killed her for it ! Data that she so selfishly withheld . But her own daughter , her beloved Divergent Tris is going to be the one who delivered it to me . - I said stop ! - Therefore ... your mother 's death , just like your boyfriend 's death ... will mean absolutely nothing . Don 't pull her out . Not yet . No ! Bring her back ! Bring her back . Now ! Bring her back ! Come on ! Come on ! Bring her back ! Test subject seven is no longer viable . I really thought you were the one . We 'll just ... We 'll just have to resume our search . Find solace in your faction , Caleb . We 're your family now . Jeanine wanted me to show you this . Hey , Four , can you do that thing you do ? Hey Four , that 's pretty good right ? First I stole paralytic from infirmary then I shot her up when she was freaking out about you . I mean I told these guys I was pretty smart . I guess they should 've listened . - You 're real ! - Yeah I 'm real . - What are you doing here ? - You die , I die . Oh ... okay guys come on . Lets go , seriously . We can do that later . - You 're ok ? - Yeah . - Thank you , Peter . - Yeah whatever . No we 're even , stiff . Alright , come on let 's go . Before Jeanine realizes we 're gone . - What ? - The box ! We have to get the box ! Are you kidding me ? Now is not the time for souvenir tris ! Four , you have to listen to me . It 's not what Jeanine think it is , I know it 's not . My mother would have destroyed it . We have to get it . Peter , is there another way into the lab ? I mean , I have to go into the control room to disable all the doors . Okay then do that ! - Okay , right now ? - Yeah . You just choose our side whether you meant to or not . If you want to survive , make sure we do . Let 's go ! No guns , it 'll draw too much attention . - Hey . - Hold up ! - Access Denied . - Come on ! - Access granted . - Okay , let 's go .. - Is that it ? - Yes . Grab it and let 's go . - Security breach . - What 's going on ? - What 's going on ? What is it ? - There 's been a breach in the sim room . Get me a remote feed , I want to see who the hell is in there . The cameras are down in that sector too . - I 'll send the guards there now , let 's go . - Bring up every cell ! Now ! Show her . Tori finally found a way to get them out safely . - How many others ? - Every last one of them . Let 's go ! Tris ! Tris , come on , we gotta move . Tris we have to move ! I can 't , I can 't . My mom died protecting whatever 's inside of this . I have to open it and I think I know how . - Tris , if we don 't leave now , we 're not getting out of here . - I have to do this first . I know it doesn 't make any sense but you have to trust me , please . With my life apparently . Go ahead . Don 't move ! Initializing Amity sim . Back again are we ? You 're an even bigger fool than your mother . You can say whatever you want to me Jeanine , but I 'm not gonna fight you . - How very Amity of you . - I mean it . - I 'm not gonna fight you . - Of course you 're not . You 're gonna fight her . The one you really hate . What are you ? I 'm you , Tris . I 'm the real you . I 'm not gonna fight you . - I 'll make you fight me . - You 're not me . I am . I 'm what they see when they look at you . You killed Will and your parents . You 're deadly . Enough ! No one 's gonna love you Tris . They 're never even gonna miss you . This world will only be better off without you . One less Divergent ruining everything . And no one ... will ever ... ever forgive you for what you 've done . You 're wrong . Because I will . Amity sim complete . - No ! - No ! Stop ! Initializing message . Hello . I come from outside the wall . Where we have all but destroyed each other . We designed your city as an experiment . We believe that it is the only way to recover the humanity that we have lost . And we created factions to ensure peace . We believe that there will be those among you who will transcend these factions . These will be the Divergent . They are the true purpose of this experiment . They are vital to humanity 's survival . If you 're watching this now than at least one of you are proof that our experiment has succeeded . The time has come for you to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us . We have allowed you to believe that you 're the last of us , but you 're not . Mankind waits for you , with hope , beyond the wall . - You 're okay ? - Yeah . Yes . You 're wrong about us . We were never the problem . We 're the solution . - Bury the box . - What ? No one sees it . Ever . Kill them both . No ! Don 't move . Put your weapons down now ! - Stay ! - Do not move ! Hello , Jeanine . Evelyn . Impressive . I think we 're gonna like it here . Do you honestly think the other factions will stand for this ? Because you 're so popular ? Get her out of here . When that message gets out it will be the end . What message ? You 'll see . I 'm gonna put it on every monitor in the city . We have separated you from the rest of us . And we created factions to ensure peace . The time has come to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us . We have allowed you to believe that you 're the last of us , but you 're not . If you 're watching this now than at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded . Mankind waits for you , with hope , beyond the wall . These will be the Divergent . They are the true purpose of the experiment . They are vital to humanity 's survival . You did it . Everyone 's staring at me . You changed everything . What now ? Only one way to find out . Are you ready ? It 's been over 200 years . Who knows what 's out there ? You 'll never find out .

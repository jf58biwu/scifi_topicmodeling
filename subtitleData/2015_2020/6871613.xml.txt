 ... seven , eight , nine , ten . Here I come ! Michele , where are you hiding ? You must be really well-hidden , because I can 't- - - Stop , André ! Stop ! - What now ? Now it 's my turn ! One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten . André , where are you ? Are you okay ? I 'm fine . It was just a nightmare . How did you know ? How did I know what ? Don 't play dumb . I 'm with the Cause . I saw a picture of you . I know I shouldn 't have , but I was going through some stuff in the shelter and I saw the picture . - It was very useful . - You should 've stayed anonymous . I know , but it was an emergency . I would 've died if you hadn 't let me through the barricade . - Did you by any chance tell him ? - Of course not ! Our contact here is totally against protocol . Forget what you saw and I 'll do the same . Okay , candidates . From now on , each of you will get your own room . Follow me . Dad ! A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES CHAPTER 06 GLASS This held up pretty well , son . You haven 't made it through yet , and you 're already better off than anyone in the Inland . This is a new room . It 's pretty , but it 's just for show . Do you know what the Founders of the Offshore went through without the least bit of comfort , safety ... ? I get it . They brought you here to encourage me to pass the Process , - so I can have a better life- - - No , son . It 's a test . They bring in the relatives to convince the candidates to give up . And they offer that as temptation . That 's a lot of money , Dad . We could renovate our house , or build a new one . Since you don 't have any family , I came here to explain . Explain what ? Each candidate has 30 minutes to decide whether they want to take the money and return to the Inland or continue in the Process with nothing . You have 30 minutes to think about it . I have news , my friend . - Hi , Nair . - Aline just sent in her report . I don 't know what you did and , frankly , I don 't care . But whatever it was , it worked . It was all compliments . She said your measures are appropriate , moderate ... Do you understand what that means ? Yes , of course . Her evaluation was so good , the only way I 'll leave is if I voluntarily resign . Did I call at a bad time ? No . I 'm just in the middle of a test and finishing some candidate profiles . - Can I contact you in a bit ? - Sure . Very good news . Very good , indeed . We got rid of that problem . Here I come . You shouldn 't have seen this . I found you ! Do you know who I am ? Do you ? ! I came here to take you to Gerson . You murdered his son . I got in by pretending I was your father . I just didn 't expect to find this . The money the Process is offering you to quit is more than what Gerson 's offering for your head . So , I have a choice to make . Option one : I kill you right now and take a picture of the body . By the time they find you , I 'll be at Gerson 's getting my money . Option two : You walk out of here holding my hand . Like Daddy 's little girl . And I get double the cash . Isn 't that what you wanted ? To get your life back ? This will be a great help . - Mom-- - Your plan worked . You should see how proud your brothers are . Especially your little brother , Rafael . Mom , I 'm not going back . I 'm staying in the Process . Let 's talk about this . - Stop being so stubborn . - I didn 't come for the money . But that 's why you 're gonna quit . It 's for your family . Don 't you understand ? You don 't need money . How do you know what we need ? After everything you did to your brother ? Your betrayal ? What do you really know , Tiago ? You know ... I dreamed that I didn 't make it through the Process- - - Don 't even say that . - I 've seen things in here , Dad . People have died , Dad . People like me who worked hard for the chance to make it through the Process . This Process is not fair . Trust me . Maybe we should take the money- - I don 't understand you . This doesn 't sound like you . You sound more like a Cause rebel . Look how much money that is ! You wouldn 't have to preach every day- - Just the opposite ! Especially if my son is a skeptic from the Cause who quit the Process ! - You are not listening . - What matters most ? - I 'm not saying- - - What matters the most ? Tell me ! What matters the most ? Passing the Process , son ! Passing the Process . You 've known that since the day you were born . No ! That 's your dream , Dad ! It used to be mine too , but now that I 'm here , I know it 's not anymore . It was an accident . I didn 't take a single coin . You can count them . Relax . They have no value on the Offshore . We don 't use money . Have you made your decision ? I 'm staying . I 've made up my mind . I came here to pass . And I 'll do that because I want a better world for my children . You know nothing about children . And when you find out , you will see that a family needs money . No , Mom ! You don 't know ! You had tons of kids for what ? - I 've done everything for you . - No , you haven 't . I 'm going to pass , Mom . I will do it so I can change things . Forget about the money . Imagine what they would do if they found out you 're not Rafael . That you are here trying to pass the Process for the second time . You wouldn 't do that to your own son . Not to a good son . I would never do that to my Rafael . But to you , I will . I 'm glad you reconsidered , son . If you turn me in , I 'll say it was your idea . That you knew , the whole family knew . Your children would all be banned from the Process . - You wouldn 't do that to your own mother . - Not to a good mother . But to you , I 'd do it in a heartbeat . Mom , what are you doing ? Mom ! Take a close look at Rafael ! He is not who you think he is ! He 's a traitor ! He betrayed his own family . My mind is made up . There 's no reason to wait . I won 't let you quit . - I want to quit ! - Did you forget your condition ? My condition hasn 't changed . This is who I am . Where is this pride coming from ? I carried you all the way here . Don 't you want to walk again , son ? Or do you want to sit there forever ? You ! You always said I was like everyone else . As long as you have a chance of passing , yes ! As long as you can be cured , yes ! But if you want to sit in that chair forever ... I will always pray for you . May you be happy and healthy ... on the Offshore . If you choose to come back , you 'll be on your own . My son will remain in the Process . Very well . Time 's almost up , Joana . Option two , " Daddy . " Good choice . You 'll have everything you ever wanted . Now let 's get out of here . The Founders would be proud- - Go ahead and kill me ! Fuck it ! I want to go to the Offshore ! Congratulations , then . You passed . What the fuck is this ? My name is Jairo . Ezequiel sent me . We know who you are . For real . He wanted to make sure you really wanted to pass . That you weren 't using the Process just to get away . And if you really want to pass , for us ... you really are Joana . So I passed ? Yes , Joana . You passed . I ... I came here ... to say goodbye . You 'll have to take care of yourself from now on . I don 't want to . Being on your own will be good for you . It will make you strong . You will grow up , be strong . You will pass . Ezequiel , I know you 're there . You 're acting strangely . - Aline ... - What about her ? She wants to take my place . But ... that 's not really a surprise , is it ? She 's blackmailing me , Cássia . - You have to report her . - I can 't . Why not ? May I ask what she has on you ? It 's best if you don 't . That makes it hard to come up with a strategy to neutralize her . You don 't think I 've considered all possibilities already ? I 'm on your side . I always have been . Now , to get the other agents on your side , you have to pull it together . The summit meeting is in 30 minutes . Remaining candidates , from now on , you will be summoned one by one . What happened ? Was that your father ? He made me stay in the Process . He told me if I didn 't pass , I wouldn 't have a home anymore . What about you ? Who came for you ? I don 't have any family . I was raised by my brother . You are the best thing that 's happened to me in this Process . In fact , the only good thing . I know what I want , and that 's you . I 'll go wherever you go . It doesn 't matter where . - Fernando , no- - - No , I 'm serious . I don 't care about passing the Process as long as we end up on the same side . Let 's begin . First candidate . Joana is done . Next . Done , why ? Anyone care to explain ? Her individual test was applied instead of the parents ' visit . Jairo did a variation of the Quitting test and she passed . May we continue ? Candidate Michele has leadership skills , social presence and lots of awareness . She rarely shows her true emotions . Like with that other candidate , what 's his name , the one in a wheelchair . Fernando . Yes . The dynamic between them is basically unilateral . Wasn 't she the one who witnessed the execution of the Cause infiltrator ? Bruna ? Perhaps that 's the reason . We can 't be sure . We need a comprehensive test . I suggest a hybrid test . Family News with Recruitment . Good idea , Aline . Next . The candidate who stole the cube and Ezequiel let through . I suggest a Dependency test to check this candidate 's level of vulnerability . Denise will run the test . I enjoyed this place during my Process . Are you ready for your individual test ? Michele , your individual test is about to begin . If you pass , I 'll pass . We 'll make it through together . There 's a couple in the next room . They have a ten-year-old daughter . You must convince them to sign her up for the Process when the time comes . - That 's it ? - That 's it . You ! You 're friends with Bruna , aren 't you ? Michele , it 's you . You look beautiful . I forgot to mention that their daughter is Bruna 's younger sister . You will have to tell them that their daughter is dead . You passed ? You and Bruna passed , right ? They said they had news . You don 't need to say she was with the Cause . You can make something up . Unfortunately , I don 't have good news . What happened ? Is she hurt ? Just say it , girl . Bruna passed away . I 'm very sorry . My daughter ? What happened ? It was an accident . She ... She knocked over a gas cylinder- - What the hell was a cylinder doing there ? - You killed my daughter ! - No ! Bruna got lost . She walked into a room that was off-limits . - So , it was her fault ? - No , it wasn 't her fault . It was nobody 's fault . It was an accident . Where is my daughter ? I need to see my daughter . These are the records of all tests ever conducted in the Process . Your test is to come up with a new test for the Process . Even after all these years , we 're trying to make the Process more efficient , more fair . You have half an hour . It 's a tradition to project images of the Founding Couple to symbolize this time of celebration . The Foundress on this side ... and the Founder over here . Your individual test is to trigger both images at sunset , precisely at 6 p.m. tonight . No problem . Both images at the same time . One image can 't upstage the other . Right , of course . What about the switch ? The switch for one of the images is located at the end of the south ramp . The other is at the end of the north ramp . Wait . You 're asking me to be in two places at the same time . Yes . But you 're smarter than that . So , my individual test is not individual . Good luck getting anyone to help you . - Good luck . - Sure . Hey ! Buddy ! Yeah , you there ! I need a favor , real quick ! Hey , I- - Are you kidding me ? No . Why ? Did you forget what you did to me in the dorms ? That was a misunderstanding . I didn 't mean to do that . Well , I 've been eliminated . So , you can go fuck yourself . Calm down . Calm down . It 'll be okay . Easy . The clock is ticking , Michele . You must understand , over 1,000 candidates apply to the Process every year . It 's a very complex system , so accidents like this do happen . I am here to apologize ... on behalf of the Process . - Let 's get out of here . - If they leave , you are eliminated . No , please , wait ! You can 't give up like this . There 's still hope . Isabella , your youngest daughter , she still has a chance . - You bitch ! - She can have a better life ! - Calm down ! - Out of my way ! You 're not thinking straight ! The Process is her only chance ! - Shut up ! - I know how you 're feeling . - You know nothing ! - I do ! My brother died in the Process . He was murdered in here . Your time is up . Come on . Tell me about your test . To start , not all candidates are truly motivated to go to the Offshore . Unlike me . I need to pass ... because of the wheelchair . For that reason , I suggest a change in the Quitting test we had today . Didn 't you enjoy the test with your father ? That 's not it . It 's a cynical test . It 's impure , based on money . What if the candidate wasn 't aware they were being tested ? An agent tells him a story in private , a lie that appeals to his emotional side . For example : " Your father is dying . It 's your last chance to see him alive . " Candidates who decide to quit so they can address the issue will be eliminated . One thing that concerns me is that you chose to adapt an existing test , rather than creating a new one as I had requested . But I only had half an hour . That 's not enough time to research the old tests . You 've probably considered that . What matters is that we improve things gradually . Let 's consider a hypothetical situation . Suppose someone walked in here today and said your father was on his deathbed . Would you quit the Process ? I would not quit the Process whether my father was sick or not . Your suggestion is good . It might work . You passed . Thank you . You deserve it . I really need your help ! They fucked me over ! My individual test is not individual . I really need your help in order to pass . Fine , I 'll help you . But only if you tell me why you have a fake registration . What do you mean ? So do you . Yes , I do . But the Process knows about it and they forgave me . I 've already finished my individual test , Rafael . And I passed . Because I deserve it . Do you ? I 'll help you if your reason is as forgivable as mine . I can 't tell you . Please . Joana , please ... Michele , I passed ! You passed . Congrats . Really ! Michele isn 't here . I tried many times . She 's still taking her test . Fernando , let me talk to you , please . I need your help . I need you so I can pass my test . - Good luck in the Inland . - I know you are a good person . You 're a good guy . You couldn 't live with the guilt of eliminating someone . Guilt ? You cheated on the first test . You tried to eliminate me . Even joined a gang that murdered people ! Fernando , if not for me , do it for Michele . Michele and I share the same goal . I know you have faith and believe in the Process , but ... not everyone thinks the same way . Not everyone accepts it . Everything I 've done , everything , is because the world is messed up . This world is messed up ! It 's not fair that only three percent of the population , three percent , enjoy a wonderful life on the Offshore at the expense of everyone else . Some accept this injustice , but others don 't . Others fight . That 's what I believe in . So does Michele . Are you saying you 're both with the Cause ? That can 't be . What do you think I said to her to get inside the barricade ? - Michele is with me , Rafael . - Yes . - The Cause is a criminal organization . - Criminal ? People with the Cause are the only ones fighting for a better world , fighting to end this division , because that is what 's criminal . Or are you gonna say that you don 't see the harm this system brings to people 's lives ? I know you think I 'm an idiot . An asshole . Selfish , mean , whatever . But what you don 't get is that I did what I had to- " Had to , " my ass ! - I had to ! I could have done nothing . It would have been much easier . Get eliminated , go back home and that 's it . Am I sacrificing some along the way ? Yes , but to save everyone else . Do you realize the risk I 'm taking here ? If you turn me in , I 'm dead . Not eliminated , Fernando . Dead . And Michele , too . My brother was a few years older than me . Our parents died when we were kids . So , he raised me . He was everything to me . Until the time came for him to join the Process . He wanted to stay to take care of me , but I told him he had to go . Three days later , they told me he was dead . They said he cheated on a test . It was a lie . A fight broke out and ... an agent walked in and shot my brother . I spent five years hating this Process , five years being angry , five years alone ! Until my time came . When I got here ... the first person I saw was the man who killed my brother . And what did I do ? I focused on the Process ... and I passed . I don 't regret it . I know I made the right choice . And everything I did was for André . For him , in his memory . Do you understand ? I did this so his death wouldn 't be in vain . Accidents ... they happen . We can 't blame anyone for them . It 's also ... no good seeking revenge . I forgave the Process . I didn 't give up . I didn 't . And that 's what Isabella needs to do . She has to keep preparing . This is where she belongs . You don 't understand . I can 't give you my other daughter . You 're not giving her away . Look at me . I came from the same place as you . And now I 'm here . I believe in the Process . They have to say it in so many words . I need confirmation from both of you . It 's very important to me . Isabella will apply to the Process . And she will pass . She will . Thank you . I passed ! I passed ! I passed ! I 'm impressed . How did you come up with a story like that ? I did what I had to do .

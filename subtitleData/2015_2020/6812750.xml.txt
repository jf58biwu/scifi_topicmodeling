 Dirk : Previously on " Dirk Gently 's Holistic Detective Agency " ... Three questions , one answer . Patrick Spring 's will left us a map which led us to a laboratory which may have belonged to his father , Edgar Spring , or even to the original owner of the house , Zackariah Webb . Very important . And now we 've got a new map from the lab , so ... That 's the Ridgely . That 's this building . Meanwhile , Amanda 's attempt to leave the house ended in a bizarre encounter with the Rowdy 3 - where she saw some ... stuff . - Whoa . Stupidest Goddamn people alive . Fred : There were two men . One we released from his body , the other still lives . FBI ? How would you like to be a secret agent ? I 'm a rock star ! Everything is connected . ♪ ♪ My name is Joseph Weedle . I am an FBI agent .

You were done with that body anyway . Put him in the machine ! What are you doing ? ! You can 't do this to me ! Here , come on , let 's go . We 're behind the clock here . Go . Go ! Idiots .

Get him ! Get him ! [ Chomping ] Can I eat this ? What is it ? Dirk made that . Don 't eat it . Can I ask you a question ? I 'm going to ask . What ? Your apartment ... it did not used to look like this . Yeah , there was a whole ... thing . I swear to God , you are the shadiest person in the world . Dirk : Todd ! Todd , come out ! Farah says she 's solved the mystery ! I didn 't actually say that . Todd , come out ! Farah says she didn 't solve the mystery ! Oh , God . Are they waiting for you ? I think he thinks he 's waiting for me . - What about Farah ? - What about Farah ? Dude , seriously ? ! A magic detective and hot chick want you to come hang with them , and you 're acting like it 's the worst thing ever . I don 't want to drag you into it . Drag me . I want to get dragged . I 'm trying to keep you safe . Okay , Todd ! W-We 're leaving ! They 're leaving . You 'll be okay ? You 're gonna go ? I 'll be fine . - I worry . - I know you do . But ... I have your number . I have Dirk 's number . I even have Farah 's number . I 'll be fine . Ooh ! Take your " cool guy " jacket . You look good in it . Why ? Farah . I see the looks . The looks ? You-her . Not her-you . Dirk 's got a jacket . She 's got a jacket . Jacket team , go . I 'll stay here . I 'll clean this place up . - Really ? - No . Hell no . [ Laughs ] Hey . I love you . Yeah , I know . Hey ! I-It 's me . Wait up . Hey . C-Couldn 't find my jacket . That 's what took so long . I was telling Dirk , 1978 , height of the oil crisis , right ? Edgar Spring , Patrick 's father , buried his own power grid . Three-mile radius , calls it Springsborough , and ... There 's a grid . It 's under our feet . We 're walking on it right now . They say he had an unlimited energy device . - Who ? - Edgar Spring ! Aren 't you listening ? He powered this part of the city for 30 years , on his own . Power went dark around the time he bought back the Webb Mansion from the government . What happened to Edgar Spring ? No one knows . Some people say he died . Some people say he 's still out there somewhere . Why didn 't you just ask Patrick ? He never talked about it . After his wife , Catherine , was murdered , he totally removed himself from anything having to do with Springsborough . I didn 't even know about this place . So ... the unlimited energy device , that 's the machine those guys are after ? The bad guys , right ? The bad ... Yes , but no one ever found it . Until now . - Did you find it ? - No . But ... The schematic we found , it 's a layout of Spring 's power grid , including the Ridgely , with only one access point . And would you believe , could you ever for a second imagine where that would be ? Because it 's right here . Jesus Christ , this thing ? I drive by it every day on my way to work . Are we gonna climb this fence ? I want to climb the fence . Who 's climbing the fence ? Me first ! How long have you been his assistant ? - Three days . - Three days ? - Four , really . - Dirk : Todd ! I assumed you 'd been together for years . - Todd ! - Why would you think that ? Todd ! Push my bum ! Make me go up ! Right . No , we just met , and I hate him . Zimmerfield : Looking right at the plan . Hello . Hello , police detectives . Agent Weedle , we didn 't expect to see you so soon . This situation is a mess . You got anything on Farah Black ? Lydia Spring 's bodyguard ? No , we haven 't found her yet . Anything I can read on her ? I have some questions . - [ Scoffs ] Only some ? - [ Laughs ] Sure . And the bodies from the penthouse still haven 't turned up . We 're starting to think they were stolen . - We pulled them . - I 'm sorry , what ? The FBI pulled them . Part of a larger issue , none of your concern . We asked you , to your face , " Did you transfer out the bodies ? " Oh , yeah , well , at the time ... we didn 't think you needed to know . Did you connect to Dirk Gently ? I 've been trying to get some more info on the guy . No Dirk Gently , but Todd Brotzman walked himself in . Brotzman ? Gently 's assistant ? - The bellhop ? - Did he mention a corgi ? What do you know about the corgi ? - What corgi ? - The one you just asked about . Forget that . Did you arrest Brotzman ? Brotzman ? For what ? Are you kidding me ? What is this , amateur hour ? Are you guys just pretending to be cops ? Brotzman , Farah Black , Dirk Gently ... what , these are just wild cards to you right now ? Does Missing Persons even get badges , or , what , just , like , some type of laminated ... Okay , you gonna have to hold ... Nathan . Where 's Nathan ? Nathan ... Your partner . Nathan ? - Where can I find Brotzman ? - The Ridgely . You were investigating his landlord , Dorian . - Shouldn 't you ... - [ Clears throat ] I 'll speak with Brotzman myself , straighten some things out . I like your office . Am I having a stroke ? Could that guy not hear me ? And two days ago , that dude was quiet . When did he become Billy Bad-Ass ? We said too much . There is something wrong . There is something ... seriously wrong . 'Cause you know what he really wanted . ♪ ♪ Something 's weird about that dog . [ Whimpers ] [ Dirk moaning ] Oh . What do you think Patrick wants us to find ? I mean , h-how do we even know he 's the good guy here ? I have to find Lydia . I messed this up . What ? [ Sighs ] I wasn 't there when he died . But that 's not fair . You were trying to find his kidnapped daughter . Y-You were handcuffed to a bed . Yeah . That was my fault . I-It was your job , and you ... Look , I-I mean , these guys are ... are dangerous , and ... and if it 's just , like , some kind of ... M-Maybe we shouldn 't ... Hey ... [ Gasps ] I mean , I-I left Amanda alone , so ... maybe we shouldn 't ... There 's a little girl out there who needs me . You saw Lydia Spring , and as far as I can tell , the only people looking for her are him , me , and you . Patrick knew he was going to die , and this is the only lead he left us , so we 're going to figure it out , okay ? Okay ? Say ... Say , " Okay . " Say , " O-K . " Okay . - Okay . - [ Crash ] Dirk : Help ! I 've fallen in a ... thing ! There are traps here , apparently ! It 's a whole spooky trap ancient area . Very much dangerous ! I turned the crank we found in the lab , which was a mistake to do unsupervised , perhaps , now that I think about it . What ? This crank ? I don 't understand what ... [ Trap door closes ] [ Knocking on door ] - [ Gasps ] - Todd Brotzman ? Nope . Is he home ? FBI . Wait , like ... for real FBI ? Yes , ma 'am . Can you let me in ? Okay , well , uh , Todd 's not here , so ... I can wait . Just stand there ? ' Cause ... he might be a really long time . Not a problem . - Aah ! - Aah ! What the ... Where are we ? Underground . And there 's a corridor . And it 's dark . This is it . This is the clue , right ? You 're asking me ? Farah : Are you injured ? Where are you ? Farah , don 't step where I did ! Yes , that seemed like a poor choice . Hey ! Don 't wander off . I 'm investigating ! Ooh ! What can you see ? Uh , it 's dark . There ... There seems to be some kind of passage . Okay , let me see if I can find something to get you out of there . [ Cell phone buzzes ] Hello ? Hey , it 's Amanda . Sorry , I tried to call Todd and Dirk , but , uh , it went straight to voicemail . - Is everything cool ? - Todd : Who are you talking to ? It 's your sister ! - Is she okay ? - Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine , but , uh , there is a guy here . - FBI , he says . - FBI ? What 's he want ? He 's asking for Todd . He says he 'll wait outside until he comes back . Where is Todd ? What 's Amanda saying ? She wants to know where you are . Don 't tell her I 'm in a secret passage . He 's in a secret passage . What ? ! Oh ! - She 's excited ! - Of course . Seriously ? Wait , what do you mean he 'll wait outside ? He 's not just standing outside , is he ? That 's exactly what he 's doing . That 's not right at all . That 's against protocol . Is Amanda okay ? I 'm coming back . Don 't let him in . Got it . ♪ ♪ I 'll be right back to get you out of there . Stay there . Wait ! Get me out of here ! Hello ? Farah ! We should definitely go down this passageway . Dirk , wait ! Dirk , we should just stay here ! Dirk ! [ Soft rock playing ] Hi . Hey . Gordon . Hi . Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . What 's this ? A present . Oh , Gordon , I told you . Honey , you got to ... you got to stop getting me things . It 's ... It 's just not gonna change the way I feel . It 's the last one . Promise . [ Chuckles ] This Lux stuff ... You really cared about him , huh ? When he disappeared , I think everyone just sort of ... you know , was waiting , just waiting for him to come back . This FBI guy , your new boyfriend , what 's ... Gone . Probably back to his wife . What was his name again ? Nathan . [ Chuckles ] What ? He ... Uh ... Life is wild . I 'll drink to that . Hmm ? [ Gasps ] FBI . Ready to let me in ? No . Todd is coming soon , so ... This door is broken . [ Chuckles ] Hoped you wouldn 't notice . I don 't want you in here , and you can 't just come in with ... I think I 'll wait inside . No . Are you serious ? No . Get out of here right now . You shouldn 't be alone . If anything happened to you , who would come looking ? Todd : Dirk , this is crazy . Lots of debris . Careful . Probably earthquake damage . Who cares ? There 's a door . You think it leads to a way out ? Possibly . Maybe even probably . Definitely ? Where 'd you get that ? Spring 's lab , same place I got the crank that got us in . You just ... stole stuff ? No , found . It 's like stealing , but no one yells at you . I call it an " Everbulb . " I think it 's using electricity from our bodies to power itself . Edgar was absolutely obsessed with electricity . Fantastic , right ? Do you not see ? Can you not comprehend how freaking weird this is ? We are now underground with a magic lightbulb . This place has been here for decades , and even if Patrick Spring hid something in his father 's maze , what the hell does this guy want ? [ Door creaks open ] Dirk : Oh ! ♪ ♪ What now ? [ Door slams ] Oh ! Ah ! What is this place ? Something from Patrick Spring . A message . [ Rumbling ] I think the message is , " You 're going to die .

Give me your jacket ! - What 's wrong with yours ? - Give it to me now ! [ Grumbles ] - Oh ! - Aah ! Oh , well done . Now our death is even more stabbier than before ! Why would Patrick Spring send us here ? To kill us ! Kill ... or test . He ... He left the crank to let us in . He wants us to be here ! Maybe he 's an awful person , Todd ! Maybe he wants to see that we have something that no one else has . The Everbulb ! Find an open socket now ! Ah ! Ohh ... Ah ! I got it , got it ! Give me the bulb ! It didn 't work ! Well , why plug in a bulb that lights itself ? Because it 's not a bulb . The bulb is a key ! It 's a doorknob ! Come on ! Aah ! [ Both panting ] [ Lightbulb unscrewing ] Nicely done , Todd . How are we going to get out of here ? It 's another one of those chambers . There must be another door down there somewhere . Wait , Todd , what if there 's another killer machine ? We cannot just walk blindly into it like ... We can 't just walk blindly ? You 're saying this ? Come on , I 'm getting out of here , whether the Spring family likes it or not . T-Todd ? You 're close to your brother . We 're related . And he 's close to Dirk Gently . " Close " might be pushing it . Why did Todd steal our dog ? Are you high right now ? You know , your brother is yea-close to a warrant , and , really , so are you . Aiding . Abetting . Probable cause . You are . You are high . Hello , Amanda . Everything okay ? I think so . - What did he ask you ? - I 'm not gonna lowball this . He 's being really weird . Join me outside . Ma 'am , I think we 'd ... Join me ... outside . You don 't get ...

You know , when I first read you were Spring 's bodyguard , when he died , I assumed you were going to be a lot of help to us , but you know what , now I see it . Now I see what stopped you from going the agency route . The psychological portion . I ... I was just ... Being careful , right ? The same type of being careful that led to you being refused entry into the Army Rangers , the FBI , Naval Intelligence . Paranoid , panic prone , unstable . Christ , you just laid hands on a federal agent ! You need help . I ... You don 't even ... Look , those situations were complicated , and just ... Give me back my Goddamn gun right now , and I won 't have you arrested . I 'm not your enemy here . If things get any more confusing , give me a call .

Okay , maybe I should see a trend , but ... Look , Dirk , I 'm just trying to deal with the realities that you keep dragging me into . You climbed a fence , you cranked a thing , you fell into the ... the thing . Let 's not reinvent the truth . That fence was not climbed , just ... ambitiously fondled . You created this situation ... yes , no ? Yes . We almost just died . We almost just got crushed to death . So stop making jokes and acknowledge that , not in panic , but to me , as a person . Okay ? I 'm sorry , Todd . Thank you . Look , Amanda needs me , and you 've trapped me in a death maze . You keep calling me your assistant , and I 'm not that , but I will help you if it means getting out of here , so calm down . - I feel reassured . - Excellent .

 Everything that lives must one day fade away . In its place , new roots take hold . New life grows . There may be some impure elements left behind . Some still who remain hidden within the Abbey . You want them killed . Purified . And what about the CDC ? Purify them first . But bring Dr. Jordan to me . Sarah . Sarah , open up . Sarah , please . Sarah . Sarah , open the door . Look , what happened to you ... . Just ... . Sarah , don 't shut me out . Talk to me . Please . Open the door . Sarah . Get out of my way . I need to go to the lab . You 're not seriously going back to work ? What would you like me to do ? Curl up in my bed and cry ? - We have to get you off this island . - I 'm not going until I find my baby . It 's still alive , Alan . I know it is . Somehow , I don 't know how , but I know that it 's alive . I 've run every possible prenatal test known to man . My baby is different . - Okay ? It just- - - Our baby . Exactly . So you should understand why I need to know one way or the other . Day eight , St. Germain Abbey . Still haven 't located the contact . I 'm on my own . The plan is to make camp for the night , depart at 0600 hours . Potential contact Caleb has been vetted . He knows nothing . This island is nothing but a grave . What happened ? Are they ... ? Are they all ... ? The thinning is completed . It was a terrible day , but a necessary one . The children are always the most difficult . Tiny hands . A pity they couldn 't be spared . I 'm sorry you had to go through it alone . That 's not what you were saying yesterday . I 've had time to think . About Anne and Agnes and all of my sisters . Each of them had a role . As I now have mine . And what is that ? To surpass them . To not just be another portrait on that wall but to outshine them all . You ... . You need a partner by your side . Pillar of strength not a sheep to slaughter . Honor me ? Make me the first in the new line . You remind me of Abigail . Our first mother . Then let me take her place by your side in your bed . Since you 've grown into womanhood I 've so looked forward to our planting ritual . Your mother was a fine and decent woman . But you you have fire . You 're not to come in here . What is this ? Were you waiting until I was actually in labor ? What do you think you 're doing ? Get your hands off me . I 'm afraid there has been a change of plans . There isn 't going to be a planting ritual today . Or ever . It 's different when it 's murder . I 've dug graves in the most remote corners of the Earth . But this ... . I 'm so sorry . I never thought he 'd go through with this . He won 't get away with it . Oh course he will . Who 's going to stop him ? I have associates coming to the island soon . Oh , my God . What happened ? - What are you doing here ? - Found him last night . Anne too . They were in some big pit . You son of a bitch . Hey . Hey . All right . Hey . Hey , knock it off . That 's enough . All right . Stop it . Knock it off . That 's it . That 's enough . What the hell is going on ? Secure the exits . I want this facility locked down . - No one in or out without my orders . - Yes , ma 'am . - You , with me . - Yes , sir . - Dr . Farragut . - Lieutenant Commander Winger . CDC sent us for you . - You 're being evacuated . - Why ? Because this is no longer the only island under quarantine . Pathogen is spreading . - Is this all from the pathogen ? - It wasn 't the pathogen . They were murdered . A result of the island 's cult leader cooling on his followers . Just like Jim Jones . We should just go- - - Easy , boys . - Hold on . Commander , how is it possible the pathogen has spread ? - You said there were no other islands . - Officially , there aren 't . Unofficially , a U.S. Military radar outpost is located 40 miles to the southwest . They 've lost 75 people . More getting sick and dying every day . Must be the bees . Maybe they got caught in the jet stream and blown to the island . - Bees ? - It 's not confirmed yet . We think bees might be responsible for spreading the infection . You have more experience than anyone . That 's why my orders are to get you to St. Sebastien ASAP . We can 't just run off . We haven 't contained the pathogen here . - My orders are very clear . - I 'm not leaving . - Sarah , I 'll handle this . - Don 't . You two ... . Sarah , maybe you should go with him . Get off the island . - Who the hell is this ? - He 's no one . This is Dr. Alan Farragut one of the top infectious-disease specialists in the world . How many Dr. Farraguts are there ? He 's my brother . Is he as much of a pain in the ass as you ? Tell me , is the other Dr. Farragut as good as Dr. Jordan claims he is ? Yeah . Yeah , he is . Great . Then he 's coming with us too . - I don 't work for the CDC . - And I don 't care . - I 'm not coming with you . - You 're coming . On your own or bound and gagged . Your choice . What about the other survivors ? Anne and her people ? There are two Coast Guard cutters a day behind us . They 'll be rounding up any survivors . It 's a mandatory evacuation . The island is being quarantined . No . You can 't . It 's the only way to eliminate the pathogen . St. Germain has been our home for hundreds of years . For most of us , the only home we 've ever known . - The dead deserve our respect . - I agree . You have 24 hours to give it to them . - But-- - This isn 't an argument . It 's my call . I won 't be responsible for another Narvik . Dr. Farragut , where do you think you 're going ? If you wanna bring my brother along , fine . But right now I 'm caring for these people . And that 's my call . Anne , wait . What are you doing , Peter ? Don 't abandon your friends for me . Hey . I went missing for three days and they didn 't make much of an effort to find me . Are you okay ? I feel so lost . Alone . We kept out the outside world for so long . But I always afraid this day would come . I won 't let them destroy your home . Thank you , Peter . Now I need to go pay respects to our dead . Not alone , you don 't . My friends they may not care about giving those people a proper burial . But I 'm not like them . How does it feel choosing another 's path ? You tell me . You 've been doing it for centuries . I 've always enjoyed my unique place in this world . Take Agnes , for example . Her death was swift and merciful . I saved her from a long and painful decline . Don 't you talk about her . - You don 't have that right . - Of course I do . I made her , and I ended her , just as I 'm going to end you . That 's a lot of big talk for a man facing the end of his path . I 'm going to enjoy not having to hear you chirping in my ear every day . You say that , but what are you going to do ? What are you going to do , girl ? You want to kill me ? I 've lived 500 years . Death waits for me . No matter what you do , I will live forever . Good . I 'm counting on it . Hey . What happened to you last night ? Are you okay ? I ... . I don 't really wanna talk about it . Okay . Just glad you 're all in one piece . Doesn 't ... . Doesn 't really feel like that . You 'll feel better once we get off this island . Can 't imagine how things could get any more insane . I can . Oh , hey , I found this old ledger . Some kind of genealogy record dating back to the 1600s . Here 's the weird part . Look at the father 's name . He 's listed as the father for every child over the last 400 years . Has to be a mistake . Michel Dubois ? It 's Michael . - Michael couldn 't have fathered every kid . - But what if he did ? And what if it has something to do with the pathogen ? Come on , things are intense enough without you screwing with my head . - Look , Kyle , we really need to talk . - About what ? A 500-year-old-man ? This is payback for all the Hot Zone stuff , right ? How do you expect me to believe that you 're- - ? Immortal ? It 's okay . You can say it . I understand this is very difficult to grasp , but what could I gain by lying to you ? That 's what I 'm trying to figure out . Maybe you 're sick . Paranoid delusions are a symptom of the pathogen . Preceded by jaundice and fungal nodules neither of which I have . Come on , this is crazy . What about my foot injury ? You stitched it up yourself , right ? The spike tore through the sesamoid and took a good two inches of skin . It took 18 hours to heal . And my stab wound ? You saw how much blood I lost . I had a punctured lung , a lacerated liver . So you got a hell of an immune system . Still , that doesn 't prove the other thing . Tell me how . What other reasonable explanation is there for this ? No . No . There 's no way it can be true . Stop screwing around . The honey 's dangerous . It is , isn 't it ? Highly infectious . Crawling with mycotoxin . Sarah , Jesus . Don 't- - Don 't . That 's suicide . Delicious . Brother Harris . He cared for the roses . He knew to the day when they would bloom . - You said this happened before ? - Yes . Most recently about a hundred years ago . Then , as now , the fellowship failed . It was Michael , wasn 't it ? Even back then ? Yes . But how did you know ? I 've known quite a few immortals , Anne . How many ? At the beginning , there were 500 . We thought he was a god . Never aging , healing so quickly . He told us he was the only one , and we never questioned it . We trusted him . But when Agnes saw Dr. Jordan 's eyes , she knew . We were such fools . You had no reason not to believe him . But now I do . And he 's going to have to answer to me . I 've been wanting to tell you for a while . Why ? So my head could explode ? You know , I didn 't like lying to you . Look , it was difficult for me to accept too but it 's who I am now . So all the times I was worried sick about you ... . It was ... . It was very sweet . Stop it . Stop shooting . - Stop it . - Get out of the way , Dr. Farragut . Tell your men we 're here to cure this pathogen , not murder its victims . - What happened ? - Came out of nowhere . Must have been hiding inside the building . I saw this man five days ago outside the gate . That 's not possible . He chased me and Peter . I put two bullets in him . - You said they were dead . - We thought they were . You thought ? - I want two men on the gates . - Yes , ma 'am . We 're getting the hell out of here . No . We can 't leave . We need to examine this Mycotic right away . - My-what ? - My-- No more stalling . Finish packing and let 's go . No . No , Sarah 's right . This pathogen kills in two days . - This man 's been alive for at least five . - So ? So if the Mycotics outside the wall are not dying , we need to figure out why . This could be the break that leads us to the cure . You really think you have something ? We won 't know until we can do an autopsy . A quick autopsy . We ship out at 1600 . So is this it , my dear ? Is this your grand plan ? Most of it . And do you think you 've beaten me ? You 've imprisoned the king . Congratulations . That would make you the queen of nothing . This coming from a man who just killed his children . Yes . Yes . Yes , I 've killed a thousand of my children . And I will create a thousand more and kill them all over again . Children are simply wisps of dandelions . Such bravado for a man who stayed hidden on an island his entire life . Men have worshiped me , little girl . I 'm sorry . I can 't hear you from up here . Get on with it already . Get on with it . Fill this pit with snakes or rats or whatever else you imagine might frighten me . Well , what , then ? You going to burn me ? Drown me ? Armies have tried to kill me and failed . It 's ready . Is that my punishment finally arriving ? It is . A fitting end for a king , if I do say so myself . What do you think you 're doing ? I 'm creating a monument to you . A shrine . You think this is going to scare me ? But you can 't do this to me . I 'm your father . And I 'm a dandelion with teeth . You can 't do this to me ! I will have centuries ! - You know what to do . - And you have mere seconds . Three layers . You will become dust . And the dust will settle upon this island , and when I 'm free I will walk upon that dust . No matter what you do , you will wither away and die ! I will live forever ! And you will die ! I 'll meet you at autopsy . There 's something I need to do . Be careful with that one . She 's dangerous . Amy . I need to speak with Michael . Where is he ? Dr. Jordan , I understand you and your friends will be leaving us soon . It 'll be a shame to see you go . Turns out we 're not leaving just yet . So I need to see Michael . I 'm sorry . Michael 's no longer in charge here . Then who is ? You 're kidding me , right ? Given our recent tragedy , I 'd expect more compassion . Compassion ? You people ripped my baby out of me . I wasn 't even aware you were pregnant . - You 've really kept your figure . - Do you think this is a joke ? Of course not . No one here would ever hurt a baby . I don 't know what happened to you but if you want my help , all you need to do is ask . Dr. Jordan ? Lieutenant Commander Winger requests you don 't stray from the group . Are you saying you can help me find my baby ? Of course . Michael 's gone . This fellowship won 't run on fear anymore . Dr. Jordan , please . I haven 't seen Sarah in a while . Any idea where she 's gone off to ? She wanted to have a word with Amy . And you let her ? I think Sarah can take care of herself . What with all the immortality stuff . - So you 're up to speed on that , are you ? - Seriously ? I didn 't believe it at first either . But trust me , it 's real . Was she born that way ? - No , made . - By who ? It 's a long story . But it all ties back to Ilaria . Come on . You 're not really gonna try and connect them to this too , are you ? It 's why I 'm here . It 's why the world thinks I 'm a criminal . Ilaria is run by immortals , and I am trying to stop them . Gentlemen , anything to report ? We still have to run a tox panel to be certain , but this is promising . The subject 's teeth are discolored with a red substance . He has traces of the same substance under his fingernails , in his hair . So he doesn 't brush after meals . What are you telling me ? Found this in his stomach . Looks like tree sap . Maybe Sangre de Grado . - It 's a medicinal resin . - Whatever it is , he 's been living off it . - You think this gunk may lead to a cure ? - It 's a lead . Right now it 's the only lead we have . And it 's the reason we can 't leave this island . - Hey , wait a minute . - I agreed to an autopsy , nothing more . And our autopsy uncovered a potential treatment . A treatment , not a cure . The victims are still showing all the symptoms of mycosis . We need to get out there and investigate . - Find out what this is all about . - Outside the walls ? This island is littered with corpses . I am not adding another name to that list . You know what , Peter ? You 're right for once in your life . - This has nothing to do with me . - Dr . Farragut . You can shoot me , commander . I 'm done . I don 't know what kind of shit show you are used to running but this is not how we do things . - I 'll talk to him . - Sarah . Peter , get out of my way . If you leave this room , you are finished with my team . Do you understand ? It was never your team , Peter . You were just keeping Alan 's chair warm . - Alan . - This wasn 't supposed to happen . I wanted all of you as far away from this as possible . All I wanted was to- - Was to stop Ilaria , to beat them at their own game . I never meant to be involved with CDC . I know you didn 't . But now you are involved . - Not anymore . I 'm sorry , Sarah . - Alan , this is why you 're here . You wanna stop Ilaria , you stop this pathogen . You find a cure . If this isn 't part of Ilaria 's plan , it will be as soon as they find out how deadly it is . Peter won 't go . Kyle doesn 't have experience . I 've never asked you for anything . I 'm asking you for this now so I can go and find our baby . Amy knows something . I need to stay here and find out what it is . Please . All right . All right , I 'll go . I said , right . A little to the right . What is going on here ? Mother . Thanks for stopping by . Do you think I should keep the rug ? So many wonderful memories . Where 's Michael ? Michael is no longer with us . - He 's found a new path . - What did you do ? What you never had the courage to do . That means you and me we are responsible for the Abbey now . No , not you and me . Just me . Don 't be ridiculous . You 're my daughter . And you 're my mother who authorized our father 's request to impregnate me . You 've lost your rights , along with Michael . The Abbey is mine now . I won 't let you destroy our home not after the destruction Michael has caused already . Agnes is dead . Michael is gone . There 's no one left to coddle you anymore . Peter was right . You had me sent to the oubliette , you child . All this chaos , this death and destruction . You cannot take what he has . You cannot be what he has been . I don 't want to be him . I want more . There was a time when buildings stood for centuries as men were reduced to crawling on their knees . But no longer . Why did you release me ? What is it you want from me ? My name is Julia Walker . I came looking for you once , Michael , 30 years ago . I needed your help then . Maybe you can help me now . Thirty years . When time has no meaning 30 years can be a day or an eternity . I 'm looking for something special . Something that was rumored to be on this island decades ago . I 'm looking for a child . There 's a new disease that 's killing our kind . We believe the only way to cure it is through immortal stem cells . And we believe that child to be the key . I remember . You remember where it is ? Every day in that pit , I was plagued by the knowledge of that child . Reminded of the failure of my work with my own children my own life . Can you tell me where it is ? Tell you ? No . I can show you . Check your ammo . What happened ? Where 's Sarah ? She had business to take care of . I 'm going in her place . Where 's Peter ? Stormed away once we all took your side . - Quite the soap opera , Dr. Farragut . - Wasn 't my intention . - You 're wrong about this , we 're screwed . - I 'm wrong about this , we 're all screwed . The child 's out here ? Yes . There 's a ... . A cleft in the rock leading to a small cave . I swear ... . I swear it was here . A lot can change in 30 years . Very good . Well , thank you , Ms. Walker , for releasing me . I 'm a patient man , but even my patience has its limitations . I wouldn 't want any of your immortal friends knowing of my existence . Better to be discreet , don 't you think ? Out of sight , out of mind . I guess the sword works . How are you feeling , Sarah ? May I call you Sarah ? You wanna help me ? Okay , tell me what happened to me and my baby . Nothing . You call being drugged and forced to undergo an abortion nothing ? We didn 't give you an abortion . We simply induced labor . You did what ? I told you . We 'd never hurt a baby . Would we , Landry ? We would never hurt a baby . You see ? It 's right there . And I 'd be happy to give it back to you . You just have to give me something in return . What ? Immortality .

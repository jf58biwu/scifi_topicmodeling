 May I ask a question ? Queen to F3 . Shoot . King to G7 . Is it a good idea to send me into battle ? Rook to E4 . the Deucalion 's Aldnoah will shut down . I 'm aware of that . Rook to D8 . But we 'll worry about that when we have to . Ensign Kaizuka ? No . I 'll go into battle . check . king takes queen . then . check . I 'll put it on the monitor . Did you come up with that move yourself ? Or is it something that analytical engine of yours cooked up ? about 70-30 . About 70-30 ? I 'm assigning tasks to unused brain cells to try to optimize its processing . So it 's both the device 's suggestion and my own idea at the same time . This ship and her crew both owe you our lives . I think we should support that . I don 't deserve any special treatment . Did you hear that Aldnoah activation tests were conducted using blood samples that had been drawn from the princess ? King to G5 . failure . Blood alone was not sufficient for Aldnoah activation . Ensign . the activation factor transferred to ... infected you . Then it was fully activated when you came into contact with royal blood . we 've obtained plenty of intel on Aldnoah and their Kataphrakts . But they still have the overwhelming edge in military strength . There 's no guarantee that we 'll win if we keep on fighting . Ensign Kaizuka ... I 'll put my money on you . Bishop to G7 . Do you resign ? Was that move yours ? Or your left eye 's ? I 'll leave that to your imagination . I suppose not even the Tharsis can see that far into the future . sir . Milord Slaine . Mr. Harklight . Let us pray that they won 't be influenced by some unexpected wind . I thought I smelled something . A dog has snuck aboard . at that . What are you doing here ? Count Barouhcruz . Count Marylcian . I rushed here so that I might join in the battle as well . Terran dog ... Mind your tongue ! Count Saazbaum ! Slaine Troyard here is my vassal . I offer my apologies . it will not go well for you . but tolerable . But to appoint him a knight ? Is that not taking your game too far ? it is not your place to offer opinions regarding my vassals . but him fighting alongside us is another matter entirely ! One cannot take to the field of battle with someone who might turn traitor at any moment ! please strike me down right here . it might very well be me who is attacked from behind . How dare you ! Men ! all of you ! I name Slaine Troyard my son right here and now . All of you here are my witnesses ! Milord Count ... Slaine . you are my son . Count Marylcian ? so be it . But if his behavior is the least bit I will put him down without mercy . Forgive me . I have put you in an awkward position . It is fine . I had decided to do this long ago . take to the field of battle . I must have a successor just in case . think of me as your father . Milord Slaine ! The count 's heir ... This puts you one step closer to your dream . Mr. Harklight . I don 't have any dreams . It 's almost time . Yes ... Eddelrittuo ? of course ! Oh ? Doesn 't that trouble you ? don 't you ? Perish the thought ! Friends on Earth ? then . A wager ? I bet ... Let me think ... perhaps ? I 'm joking . sister ? Have you seen Inko ? I think ? She 's probably with Rayet . Thanks . Don 't get lost . I 'll try . Sweats ? ! Yutaro-chan . unknown . High rate of attack evasion reported . Confirmed pilot ... Slaine Troyard . A good luck charm given to me by a dear Terran friend when we arrived on Earth . Animals that fly through the air ... Slaine ! Is he equipped with a neuro-linked analytical engine too ? Indeed . But I don 't have enough data . It dodged my attacks as though it could see the future . If that 's true ... it could be a problem . You monologuing ? I was talking to myself . That 's what monologuing means . drank of the waters of MÃ­misbrunnr and was granted vast wisdom . But the price he paid for that wisdom was his left eye . Norse mythology . Know-it-all . Don 't make fun of me ! I wanted off the ship . I was terrified . I 'd never be able to look Okojo in the eye when I do die . come see me day or night . I 'll fix it up in a flash . I 'll hold you to that . why don 't we grab a bite before the battle ? There 's still some time . I 'll pass . apparently . They say I would 've died if my organs had been contaminated by stomach contents . Oh . Sure . so maybe some tea . What are his reel selections ? and one on the left and right . It 's specced out for high-G pivots . thin wires aren 't cut out for that . Found you ! it 's Team Deucalion . huh ? I hear one of you is a Martian . little ladies . What was their problem ? Bunch of jerks ! though . All Martians are the enemy . I know that better than anyone . Rayet . You 've got the " tsun " part down pat . Huh ? though . What are you talking about ? Want some candy ? I 'm gonna deck you . We will enter defense airspace in 30 minutes . Please launch . Good hunting ! Is my steed ready ? The fine-tuning has been completed ! Good ! launching ! launching in the Tharsis . launching ! Martian Kataphrakt squadron approaching ! Calling all forces ! Commence operation ! Message from HQ ! Commence operation ! launch ! We will provide support for the attack platoons as a guerrilla force . All hands to battle stations . Our shipboard Kataphrakts are launching from Trident Base . cleared for launch ! cleared for launch ! Blastoff ! Blastoff . Target merge . Commencing attack . Attack incoming ! anyway ! Hit them when they get in close ! Hit them when they get in close ... Hit them when they get in close ... My umbrella 's been hit ! Mustang 11 ! but the debris is not ! I can 't get a clear shot with all this shaking ! moving to assist . Inaho ! what about your umbrella ? ! It 's just a drizzle . I don 't need it . darn it ! I wouldn 't be able to use it in a dogfight anyway . ready . Fire . Commence attack ! Why you ! Pivoting via wire swing-by . Returning to combat airspace . shoot . 1 ... Release . Inaho Kaizuka ... Slaine Troyard ... Marineros Base will make next approach in 30 seconds ! Main guns ready to fire . all platoons ! Get clear of our line of fire ! Rayet ! I 've got one on my six ! moving to assist . The Martian ! Marineros Base now in firing range . No friendly units in line of fire ! fire ! Marineros Base beginning to move away . Issue disengage order to attack platoons and guerrilla unit ! Put them on defense ! we 've been ordered to disengage ! Come back ! Inaho ! That 's some accurate shooting . too . pivot . I 'll wait until the instant he comes out of the rocks . He 'll attack the instant I come out from the rocks . Coordinates confirmed . Two minutes to impact . Let 's do this . Fire . I hit him ? That 's - . Slaine ? Fall back . I can still fight ! Don 't overdo it . The orange Kataphrakt ... I owe him some payback ! Looking for the gap in my barrier ? I took the liberty of changing its location . my servants ! engaged . Sword drawn . There 's no escape . Inaho ! Inko ! No ! Stay there ! Right at that position ! Terran ! Right kick thruster jettisoned . Fire ! The flames aren 't being sucked in ! The barrier gap ! You won 't get away ! Slaine ! What 's that ? A high-speed debris cluster . I picked up a debris cloud closing in at high speed on my 3D Doppler radar . too . brought low by mere debris ? ! That wasn 't debris . It was bullets . I fired them off before the battle began . They were aimed so that they would swing around the Earth and land at that spot right now . Slaine ? I had originally meant it as a trap to defeat Inaho Kaizuka . it was him . Slaine ... Shut up ! Did you honestly believe that I would swear fealty to you ? To the man who pulled the trigger against Princess Asseylum ? ! Did you think I would forgive you ? ! My second volley will arrive soon . Goodbye ... Father . Not too shabby . I have lost my second father . He was also a great man who devoted his life to the prosperity of the Vers Empire . I hereby announce my resolve to carry on both my fathers ' legacy and fight for the even greater prosperity of the Vers Empire . Lords of the Vers Orbital Knights . This is no time to be squabbling amongst each other . should we not work hand in hand to eradicate Earth 's resistance forces ? In the name of Her Imperial Highness Asseylum Vers Allusia ! Let us punish the Terrans who dare defy the Vers Empire ! He isn 't lying ... Her Highness Asseylum is biding her time at our lunar base ! - I knew it ... She 's alive . - In hopes that she may remain - you must be exhausted . weren 't you ? I was . my father and mother worked hard to raise me and used every means at their disposal so that I could serve the Orbital Knights . it is for that reason that I have the utmost respect for you . who have attained the rank of count even though you are a Terran . This new era will be for people like us . Harklight . Yes ... Count Slaine Saazbaum Troyard . Pivoting Trap

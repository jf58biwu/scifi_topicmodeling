 LUCY : Previously on Killjoys ... What do you see in those nightmares ? And why does someone here want you dead ? PAWTER : Look , if you care at all about yourself or your team , you need to get help . Can you treat me ? What 's in it for me ? I don 't like most doctors . I like you . If you have any business that you need squared away ... I 'll square it away . Hello , little bird . DUTCH : How did you find me ? I never let you go . From the time you receive the box , you 'll have one week to do as I 've asked . Khlyen wants you dead . And I want to know why . DUTCH : I love you . But you 're an idiot . JOHN : I have a real feel for asteroids . And I 'm telling you , the ship is behind that one . Okay , then . Fifty Joy . One , no one has a feel for asteroids . And two , this is the last time I take a C and C after you 've been into the Hokk . LUCY : ID beacon location confirmed . John 's selection of asteroid is correct . Hey , Lucy always takes your side . You 're her favorite . She 's a systems computer , Dutch . She doesn 't have favorites . LUCY : Correct again , John . Or we could make this interesting . ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Damn it ! Hey , our therapy session was supposed to start an hour ago , Jaqobis . Are you okay ? Yeah , I lost track of time . Sorry . Are you still having the memory issues ? I 'm fine . ( CLEARS THROAT ) A lot of people with trauma don 't want to remember what traumatized them . Maybe you aren 't ready to try . No , it 's , uh ... It 's just ... ( KNOCKING ) Hey , we found an abandoned ship . Um ... Pawter . I 'm sorry . I can , uh , come back . Um ... Sorry . Duty calls . Next time . Is the ship 's signal coming from Arkyn ? Arkyn 's empty . It 's a dead moon , thanks to the Company . We were passing the Graveyard when Lucy ... The Graveyard ? Asteroid belt . Lucy picked up a repeating ID beacon , over a decade old . Hey . You said Hokk Pong , whoever wins gets to go onboard first . You left . I made an executive decision . ( SCOFFS ) You told me to go get D 'av to be a judge , and then you scooped me ? That was my decision . It 's a C and C warrant . Claim and ... Claim and clear . Any abandoned vessel found in non-territorial space can be boarded by any RAC agent in good standing . Any and all items found on said ship can be claimed by said agent , after which time ... He reads instruction manuals , too . I don 't know who 's more annoying , him or you having to be first all the time . It 's my thing . So , how are we boarding ? Mobile bridge to the ship 's emergency airlock . I 'll make sure that life support 's online . You guys follow . Then , we grab everything we can find . Lucy , decrypt that beacon yet ? LUCY : Affirmative . The Aegir is classified as a cargo ship . Planet of origin unspecified . GWT of 20,000 . Grav weight of 20,000 ? Must be hauling heavy . Right ? Under no colors ? I mean , who knows what we 're going to find . John , why don 't you do the honors , what with your " feel for asteroids . " ( CLICKS TONGUE ) on . JOHN : All right , Lucy , time for a little treasure hunting . LUCY : With pleasure , John . JOHN : Whoa . LUCY : Airlock bridge extended . Gravity at 96 percent . I 'm in the mobile bridge . Approaching the Aegir 's emergency airlock now . Well , that 's great to hear , Dutch . I 'm so happy for you . Really . Come on , Johnny . First cool thing I find is all yours . Lucy , any luck opening the airlock door ? LUCY : Limited system interface , unable to override security protocol . Bet you 'd find a way if John was doing it . Dutch . All right , let 's see if the default Company code works . ( KEYPAD BEEPING ) ( ALARM BLARING ) Shit . LUCY : Aegir security initiated . Return to ship immediately . Dutch , get back here . You don 't know what kind of defense system this ship has . It could set off thermals or a gas cloud . If they go off when Lucy 's opening her door for me , we 're all screwed . Setting a directional charge . Dutch , what are you doing ? If this bitch won 't open on her own , I 'll make her . Dutch , no . ( ALARM BLARING ) LUCY : Charge deactivated . Dutch , what happened ? I don 't know . It just stopped . JOHN : I don 't like this . Lucy , scan again for life forms . LUCY : Still reading zero life forms . I 'm in . Grav is online . Lucy , check the O2 levels on my suit sensor . LUCY : Oxygen optimal . No toxins detected . Well , all right , then . Let 's get this party started , shall we ? ( SIGHS ) Time for some treasure hunting , boys . JOHN : Well , Lucy 's plugged in . We 'll be right over . D 'AVIN : Protocol says we clear the ship , then detonate it . So . Mines ? Oh , yeah . Big ones . How can you not love this job ? Let 's go find some treasure and blow shit up . Come , come , come uninvited Run , run , run till I find you I don 't care which side that you 're fighting Gonna get you gone Best guess what 's onboard ? Hard to say . And that 's assuming the ship pickers haven 't already gotten to her . Look out , space rats ! Grow up , Johnny . Space rats ? Really ? Yeah , it 's ... It 's an old family joke . Hilarious . System status ? Any idea what happened to this rig ? Plugged into the top-level BIOS . Telemetric engine 's cacked . The drive blew out and the crew hightailed it out . Well , any idea where she 's from ? Haven 't seen any markings I recognize . Beyond the Quad maybe ? Planet of origin info should be printed on the transponder , which we will need for proof of our claim . So , you go find the transponder , Sugar Pants . D 'avin can plant the explosives , while I go look for some booty . No . You want to say something ? No ? Mmm-mmm . ( GRUNTS ) Lucy , some music , please . LUCY : Absolutely , John . ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Sugar Pants . Nice pick , John . Will let you know when I find something pretty . You know , there were never any actual space rats . Dad just made them up to scare you away from the junkyard . Me ? I thought he made them up to keep you from joining Nova Cadets . Well , didn 't exactly work for either of us , did it ? Yeah , like pretty much everything he did . But , hey . He was just trying his best like we all do , right ? You trying to have a moment , John ? No . Maybe . Shut up . Ow ! I 'm glad that you 're seeing Pawter . Help you with your memories , you know ? You always were the optimist of the family . ( CLICKS TONGUE ) Someone had to be . All right , the engine room is in the aft deck . I 'm going to grab the transponder , and then we should go see if we can go find something before Dutch gets her hands on everything . Don 't blow yourself up . ( CHUCKLES ) DUTCH : I 'm entering the cargo hold . ( MUSIC DISTORTING ) Johnny . The music ? Cargo hold 's empty . ( SIGHS ) Ship pickers must have gotten here already . Damn it . Guys , I found something . Not cargo , I mean . Something . I don 't know . John ? D 'av ? Come back ? ( DOOR OPENS ) Lucy , what 's going on with the music ? LUCY : I 'm experiencing interference . Recalculating . ( MUSIC CONTINUES DISTORTING ) DUTCH : ( DISTORTED ) John ? Come back ? Dutch ? Say again ? ( SCOFFS ) I said there 's some kind of barricade . Signs of a fight . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) Guys , we 're not alone . I 'm not sure if you guys can hear this , but I found the transponder and it 's ... It 's weird . There 's no planet of origin info , there 's no serial numbers ... It 's blank . ( PANTING ) Stop ! I 'm in pursuit . Lower level . John . D 'av . Come in . He 's heading for the stairs . ( MUSIC DISTORTS ) Hey , Johnny , you want to fix the tunes ' ? Slacker . I got a visual on some blood here . Looks fresh . Copy ? Anybody ? Whoa . Whoa , guys . LUCY : Warning . Possible contamination detected . Quarantine procedure initiated . Disengaging . Lucy , what the hell ? What are you doing ? Lucy ! ( SIGHS ) Dutch ? Hey ! He 's at the airlock . Get back , you son of a bitch ! Guys , I found someone . Get back ! DUTCH : Stop ! Lucy , possible breach . Buddy , do not even think of entering my ship . What the ... I don 't understand . Stop . What are you doing ? Lucy , do not open ... No ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Lucy . ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) Lucy , return to ship and re-engage . Acknowledge . Lucy . This is Dutch . Acknowledge . JOHN : Somebody talk to me . Anybody . John ? Where are you ? Dutch . Lucy went into quarantine . I can 't get a response . She retracted the bridge . What the hell is going on ? I have no idea . JOHN : Lucy 's barely 50 meters away . But without a bridge , she might as well be 50,000 . Why can 't we get her to respond ? Why won 't she come back ? I don 't know . It 's like she sensed some kind of contamination and went into full quarantine . That 's deeply unnerving . Plus , my deep suit 's gone missing . At least our comms are working again . Thanks for that . And I do have full access to all the security cam feeds . And I 'm working on access to Lucy now . Be careful with that guy D 'avin apprehended . We 're just about to interrogate him . You want to tell us what 's going on , Mister ... Hogan . We were just ship pickers . Me and Wilson . HOGAN : We picked up a beacon . Same as you . Cargo ship . Origins unknown . Sounded like a big payday . Once we boarded , our ship 's anchor line retracts . No way back . No engines . No comms . Nothing . How long ago was this ? ( SIGHS ) Couple of years , maybe . More . You lose track . We would have been happy to get you out of here if your pal wasn 't too busy trying to hijack my ship . Lady , you see what he did to my leg ? His fingers ? Poor bastard was spaced . Seen enough of it in the service . D 'AVIN : You an officer ? I worked for a living , son . Infantry . First and Seventh , Howling Mavs . The Mavs , from Korel . You guys were in the ass end of the Skyborne . Royal Syndicate . Well , you don 't say . Cavalry has arrived . Lead on , son . D 'av . Before we go bringing this guy onboard , what 's your gut on him ? Considering how long he 's been stranded ? I 'm not sure I 'd be any better off . Plus , he 's infantry . They 're usually not known for their personalities . I heard that . But as soon as you 're done insulting my beloved corps , maybe we want to figure out how to get the hell off of this coffin . I 'm all ears . We have no contact with our ship , and my deep suit 's gone . It must have been Wilson . Well , I still got the ones me and Wilson used when we first boarded . You have deep suits , and you never used them to get away ? Ship was gone , so where to ? The nearest rock ? Here . Let me show you where they are . Oh . Sorry . Leg . Damn it . You need that looked at . You got an infirmary on board ? Yeah , yeah , but it 's ... It 's on a lower deck . Suits are on upper level , aft . Look , I 'll take Mr. Hogan to the infirmary . Get him patched up . You go get the suits . We meet back up in the engine room . Omega clearance required . Oh , you ... Fine . Be that way . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Mmm-hmm . ( SIGHS ) He ) ' , hey . Hang on . Dutch ? I think I got something here . Any luck with Lucy ? Not yet . I 'm resetting the ship 's signal systems . But I don 't think that this is a cargo vessel at all . What does " lMUR " mean to you ? Imperial Marines of the United Republic , out near the rim . Exactly . And that 's why there 's no cargo . It 's military . Military . What kind of mission ? I 'll go through the logs while the array resets . Well , just do it fast . As soon as I find these deep suits , we are off . Dutch ? You Okay ? Stand by . I thought the old man said the infirmary was on the lower deck . ( EXHALES ) Any chance you can put the heat on in the infirmary ? The room 's an icebox . JOHN " . Sure . Soon as I 'm done with the logs and reconnecting to Lucy . Hey , you want me to make you some lunch , too ? That would be nice . HOGAN " . Always amazes me . Meet a new guy , serves on another planet , whole other system even . Same jokes , same crap . Military 's nothing if not predictable . What about you ? Ah ! You know . Same old story . Looking for fame and fortune . Nice , safe retirement . And now that we have received the final batch , I am very excited to begin our first procedure on live subjects . Oh , just over there , please . Stop . What ? Hogan . Oh ! My guys all told me it was a dumb idea . Miss those idiots . Well , you know what they say . You join for your nation , but you stay for your squad . It 's all right , son . You 're here now . Whatever you were looking for , this is the answer . Excuse me ? JOHN : D 'av , it 's John . Don 't respond . Just listen . Trust me . This old guy is not what he says . Get to the engine room , now . Give me a signal you copy . How is this ship for space rats ? Hmm . Nice . See you soon . Space rats ? The hell you talking about ? Sorry . Old Skyborne slang . We got a problem in the engine room . The sooner I can swing by there , the sooner we can get you to the infirmary . Well , suit yourself . Elevator 's this way . ( GASPS ) Johnny . Where 's D 'av ? JOHN : He 's on his way to the engine room . Why ? How deep is this engine room ? Don 't worry . When we get there , you 'll understand . Damn it , thing 's coming off . ( GRUNTING ) I told you it would come undone the way that you tied it . Sorry , son . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) What the hell ? We 've got work to do . Oh ! HEY - Hey ! What the hell is this ? ( PANTING ) COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-A . You will submit to questioning . Prepare for implantation . HOGAN : Just relax . Trust me . What the hell is this about ? Where 's my crew ? It will be their time soon . COMPUTER : Implantation commencing . Well , I can 't say it will be okay . ( GASPS ) ( COUGHS ) But at least now we 'll get to the truth , won 't we ? For instance , I never left the service . And I love my job . What did you do to me ? What was that cloud thing ? Just listen . You 'll see . COMPUTER " . Prisoner 248-A . What is your name , rank and serial number ? Go on . Tell him . Name , rank and serial number . I 'm not telling you anything . Unacceptable response . Son , I 've been a guard on this ship since she made her first sky break . Trust me . You will talk . Commencing persuasion . Dominant forearm . Ah ! Name , rank and serial number . No . Stop . Name , rank , and serial ... D 'avin Jaqobis , Skyborne Second Shield , 956 ! Stop ! Commencing reconstruction . ( EXHALES ) There . That wasn 't so hard , was it ? ( COUGHING ) WOMAN : I don 't know anything about Red 17 ! I don 't know anything about Red 17 ! COMPUTER : Prisoner 23-B . What is your connection to Red 17 ? I don 't know . I swear . You are crazy . COMPUTER " . Unacceptable . Commencing persuasion . Ocular region . How many ? Dozens . The recordings are from years ago , but they 're all the same . Starts with easy questions , then gets more personal . Last stage is this . Red 17 . Where the hell is D 'av ? I don 't know , but he 's not answering his comms . I 'm searching the feeds for him . We 've got to find him . Now . Can we check them on another monitor ? Yeah , why ? Because I recognize that woman . You 've got to see this . I get it . Oh , yeah ? Get what , son ? Your ship . No cargo . No ID . You 're not regular military . You 're black ops . Enhanced interrogation . You 're a torture unit . Like I said . Nice not to have to lie anymore . But you 're the one with questions to answer . So , where 's your crew ? What happened ? Come on , soldier to soldier . Well , we were out on tour maybe six weeks when we ran through the path of a solar flare . Blew the engine right out . Started drifting . I got sent down to check the machine . That 's when it chose me . COMPUTER " . Prisoner 248-A . No . Wait . Hold on . First few weeks , you think , " Well , bad luck . " Next few , you think , " Maybe there 's a reason . " COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-A , detail your last mission . But that doesn 't matter now , son . JOHN : Come on , D 'av , where the hell are you ? You 've got to be somewhere . Most of these people have military ID . It 's not just prisoners . It 's the ship 's crew . What the hell did this to them ? That cloud , it 's like some kind of drug ? What kind of drug puts a hole in your head ? Or these other ones . These people died from massive brain trauma . D 'av ? Dutch , it 's him . DUTCH : Where is that ? I don 't know . The feed 's blanked . This is just what 's coming through raw . Come on , give me some sound . D 'AVIN : No , wait . Please don 't . We have to go . We have to get him . Yes , we do . But we don 't know where he is . And we don 't know what the hell is happening to him . That console is our only link to him . Use it . Stop . I don 't know anything . There 's no point . The captain said the same thing . " I don 't know what happened . It was an accident . You 're just a guard . " So , I showed him the way . Gave him his turn . You killed your own captain . No ! I helped him . I helped them all . To do their duty . COMPUTER : Commencing persuasion . Lower left abdomen . ( CHOKING ) D 'av ! D 'av , we 're here ! The room must be shielded . Has to be why our comms don 't work . We 're cut off . JOHN : Come on , D 'av , give us a clue to where you are . Are you scared ? Screw you . It 's okay . I was scared , too . When you don 't know what 's going to happen . COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-A , detail your last mission . I know what 's happening . Oh , yeah ? What do you know ? You start with simple questions . Then , you get personal . Looking for weak spots . Good . That 's right . Until you break them down . So , then , you know there 's no point lying about anything . Is there ? Unless you 've got something to hide . Listen to me , son . I know you . Soldiers . Warriors . We 're the same . No ! Trust me . It 's the only way . Tell me what you did . Do you know what he 's talking about ? No . No . I 'm still looking for location here . COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-A , detail your last mission . It was a recon . Simple sweep and sensor . Me , my squad . There was nothing . Go on . I can 't . You just started . I can 't . What do you mean ? I can 't ! I mean I can 't remember ! I don 't know what it was about or how it started ! Then , what do you remember ? What do you ... I killed them ! COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-A , please explain in detail who you killed , and in what ... MY Squad ! COMPUTER : Commencing reconstruction . But ... Your own squad ? Son . Why ? I don 't know . ( SOBBING ) I just know what I did . JOHN : We 've got to shut down that machine . DUTCH : How ? Follow me . HOGAN : You did good , son . You did real good . COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-A , what is your connection to Red 17 ? But we 're just starting . What is this thing , Johnny ? Gut instinct . I don 't know . Whatever it is , it ... It breaks things down , but then it builds them back up again . It 's biological , maybe , or mechanical . It 's her . She might give us something . This is Dr. Lyra Grange . This is my final report . I don 't have much time , there are still so many of us . COMPUTER : Prisoner 23-B , you are not authorized to leave your cell . It 's the head guard , Hogan . After the accident , he completely decompensated . He lured the captain , the crew , there was a fight ... COMPUTER : Prisoner 23-B . You are currently in infirmary , starboard . Return to sublevel 1 for interrogation . There . Sublevel 1 . I 'm going . No , I 'm going . He 's my brother . John , you still need to figure out what the hell we 're dealing with here . Dutch , wait , wait , wait , wait . He used the nanites on all of us . Nanites . There 's no way to override them . The interrogation program won 't stop . It just keeps going . I don 't know why . There 's no other way . ( FIRES ) Well . That 's one way to beat it . I think I 've found them . You figure out how to shut it off ? WOMAN : Advances in sub-microscopic technology allow the nanites to break down any organic matter in ways that mimic disease or trauma . We can 't shut it off . It 's just microscopic robots programmed to tear us down , and then build us up again and again . I mean , it 's the perfect torture device , really . But the program running them , when does it stop ? That 's the thing . The accident didn 't just ruin the engine . It fried the whole system . It 's on a loop . Torture , heal , torture , heal . I don 't think it knows how to stop . So , unless we destroy the program , the only way out is to die faster than it can fix you . That 's why Mr. Crazy went out the airlock . He wasn 't trying to steal Lucy . He was just trying to ... Make it stop . COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-A , what is your connection to Red 17 ? I 'm telling you , I don 't know anything . Unacceptable . Come on , son . This is what it 's all about . We 've all been there . What do you mean , " we " ? I 'm the one on the inside of this glass . You don 't think I 'd spare myself , do you ? That would be very unfair . I do my time . You do this to yourself ? Affirmative . Well , I did . After the crew , my own men , took the coward 's way out . I was the only one left . Every day , I 'd come in . And every day , he asked me the same question . Red 17 . And when I didn 't answer ... Okay . Okay , then . At least tell me what Red 17 is . Oh , I have no idea . Need-to-know basis . Way beyond my clearance level . They never told you what you 're looking for ? Shouldn 't matter . The program will know . The program has to know . I mean , when it knew I didn 't have the answer ... One day , it just ... Stopped asking . Rejected me . But I 'm a good soldier . I knew the mission wasn 't over . So , I set up a beacon to bring the curious . The greedy . The lost . Like you . Why do you keep doing this ? Why ? I guess I just have faith , son . ( ALARM BEEPING ) Your friend tripped the alarm . Looks like it 's her turn now . Dutch ? No . Get out of here . Run . No , look out ! Didn 't even make me come running for you . You are a thoughtful guest . No ! No ! ( GASPS ) What the hell are you doing ? Saving you . You 're welcome . There 's nothing to save here . Yeah . Saw as much in the infirmary . That wasn 't ... That wasn 't what I wanted . They did that by their own hand . They were weak . Gave up . COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-8 . What is your name , rank and serial number ? Dutch. lt won 't stop . I know . We saw . And heard . Did John ? Commencing persuasion . Dominant forearm . ( SCREAMS ) All right , missy . You 're tough . But you saw your friend here . Heard what he said . You know what 's coming . You don 't know what I 've seen , old man . Or what I know . I know what it means to be ashamed of what you did , of who you are . But I also know that whatever happened then , he is on my crew now . He 's my partner . COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-8 , what is your name , rank and serial number ? And I know all about you . Oh , Yeah ' ? What about me ? I know you 're nothing . Just like the program running this whole thing now . Busted . Broken . Just a glitch in the system . No . I was the one who never gave up . He chose me . And guess what . I know about Red 17 . What do you mean ? What do you know ? ( DEVICE BUZZING ) You 're dead . ( GLASS SHATTERS ) ( SCREAMS ) ( ALARM TRIPS ) Time to go . How do we get out of here ? D 'av ! Did it work ? Prisoners 248-A and 248-8 . You are not authorized to leave your cells . Here , take your brother . Prisoners 248-A and 248-B . Return to sublevel 1 immediately . They 're still in me , I can feel them . I know . Where is she going ? Dutch ! Stop ! D 'avin , wait ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) No ! JOHN : Move . We 've got two minutes to set the mines . She 's dead . No . She 's strong . COMPUTER " . Prisoner 248-A . You will now face ongoing persuasion until you return to your cell . What are you talking about , strong ? She 's in deep space with no suit , nothing . And those things are still inside her . And what do you think is keeping her alive ? JOHN : The human body can 't survive in space . There 's no air , there 's no pressure . There 's radiation . The blood boils . Skin freezes . But the nanites repair anything short of brain death . LUCY : Crew proximity detected . Emergency protocol enacted . They should keep her alive long enough to get to Lucy , to plug in the manual override code . When they 're done fixing her , they 'll tear her apart again . There 's no oxygen , there 's no time ... COMPUTER : Prisoner 248-A . ( GROANING ) You will now face ongoing persuasion until you return to your cell . I 'm sorry . But I love you . No , wait , don 't . ( GUNSHOT ) ( GRUNTS ) How was that in any way loving me ? Because it can 't fix you and torture you at the same time . Massive injury triggers the repair phase . Subject wounded . Commencing reconstruction . See ? And when they 're done fixing me ? Fine , but give me the gun . Don 't bother . It won 't help you . Oh , for the love of ... How are you not dead ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Lucy , open the door to the hold . LUCY : I 'm sorry , but quarantine protocol states you must remain in airlock one ... Lucy , I 'm in serious pain here ! There are protocols , Dutch . ( GROANS ) Lucy , I need to blow up that ship before these things rip me a new one . I 'm sorry , but quarantine protocols state you must remain in airlock one full hour before ... Lucy , John 's in trouble . ( EXHALES ) No favorites , my ass . I 'm taking over , you mechanical bitch . HOGAN : You belong here . You 're just like me . No , I 'm not . A good soldier . You killed your men , son . You have to atone . Here , you can face the past . Remember what you did ? ( GRUNTS ) That guy talks way too much . DUTCH : I 've connected the bridge to the Aegir 's airlock - Let 's go - Let 's go . We 've got to get out to Lucy . ( PANTING ) JOHN : Dutch , we 're aboard . Mines are about to blow . Everyone good ? Ready ? Body about to explode ? Let 's go . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) How much longer , John ? Decon gas has to get in deep . You know how many millions of those things are in you ? Fine . I swear Lucy 's enjoying this . LUCY : Decontamination sequence complete . Finally ! Session two will commence in 10 minutes . Oh , come on . It 's not my fault you 're filthy . Watch it . So . Just , whatever you want to say , go ahead . Ask . Why ? Like I said on the ship , I can 't remember what I did ... No , no , no , that 's not what I mean . I mean , why didn 't you tell me ? Why carry this all on your own ? Is this why you ran away from all of us ? John . You heard what I did . Yeah . I can help , D 'av , I can do something . How are you going to help me , John ? Well , there 's something to figure out . There 's something to fix . I mean ... I like fixing things , remember ? Yeah , I remember . Space rats . ( CHUCKLES ) You know , you really have to work on your moments . Yeah . But , John . Thanks . ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) You know , when you told me to take my shirt off , this is not exactly what I had in mind . Shut up , Jaqobis . You owe me a session . Last time I ran this , you had scarring all along the frontal cortex . I assumed it was trauma , concussions . But now , it 's all cleared away . Well , I told you what those things were doing to me , fixing stuff . I know . But look here . All right , help me out . I missed neuro class in basic training . Here . Here . And here . Those are neuro dampeners . Memory blockers . Very sophisticated . How long have they been there ? Hard to say . Do you remember having any surgery at all ? No . Well , at least now we know you don 't have traumatic amnesia . Someone doesn 't want you to remember . Great . I 'm sick of chasing dead ends . I need to know why . We will , okay ? I promise . What ? You seem different . Different better ? Or different worse ? Let 's find out . You didn 't think I 'd fall for that trick of yours , did you ? It wasn 't a trick . It was a message . Here 's another . Get out . I can 't . I could make you . Oh , that would be fun . But not today . Today , I need you . Why ? Why are you here ? In my ship , in my head , everywhere . Why can 't you just leave me alone ? Because without me , you 're becoming weak . Vulnerable . I am not vulnerable . No ? Don 't you even look at him . Oh , little bird . If I have to , I can do so much more than just look . Get your things . We 're going .

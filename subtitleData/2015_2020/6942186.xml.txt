 You got the right idea . - Oh , yes , back to work . - Hey , there 's the man of the hour . - Happy birthday , man . - Thank you . How you feeling ? Feeling older ? Feeling wiser ? Well , it all blends together after a little while . I wouldn 't touch that . I 'm gonna eat all of it . That 's what 's gonna happen . See that ? Come here real quick . Glen , can you bring up visual on the shaft real quick , please ? Visual 's coming up now . How far down are we ? We are passing the 1,000-foot marker ... now . Let 's take it further . - Can we pick up the drop please ? - Yeah , speed that up . 3,000 feet . What was that ? You seeing that ? Wait , can you rewind that , take it back ? Sasha ! What the ... - That 's C-shaft , isn 't it ? - Yeah . All right . - Be safe . - Yeah . Bring that back up . Sasha ! Bill ! What 's going on ? Oh , God ! We got a war going on down here . A global assault on a scale the world has never seen . We have reports that these invading creatures are terrestrial and of subterranean origin . The world 's military forces are making no gains against these masses and are heavily outnumbered by what some are calling " demon hordes . " Reports of mass migrations and the beaching of thousands of marine animals along the European coastline appear to be precursors to the eclipse . If we 're still on the air , stay in your homes . Take shelter . Our nation is under attack . Similar events are happening all over the world . We want to repeat , take shelter now . After 24 horrific hours and a second eclipse , the world needs to recover . No one knows what this means for us . The president has proposed the creation of a new department of homeland security . The DHS , which will ensure the preparedness of our nation in the months and years ahead . Military installations now circle the globe and all deep-core fissures . These facilities , known as " gates , " stand guard against the dire possibility of another event . That harrowing 24 hours of terror known as the " Day of Reckoning . " There you are , buddy . Not doing so well , are you ? Seen better days . You and me both . Come here , little man . I know . This sucks . Sorry , little buddy . Time to go home . All right , we got it . Bagged and tagged . - What do we got ? - Next time , I think you should go in . Goddamn ! - Is it still alive ? - No . Too many jellybeans , I think . Poor little guy never had a chance . That asbestos thing , by the way , hasn 't gone away yet . That 's next on my list . Boss , I 'm serious . It 's ... - Yep . - It 's kind of a big ... Yeah . No , the other way , the other way . Thanks a lot , Mr. Wilson . Appreciate it . All right . Hi , Laura . Hi , Milton . I need to borrow your skeleton . - Sure . It 's right over there . - Thank you . I was wondering . I mean , I know your ex-husband has your son for the weekend ... and obviously you 're gonna have to eat , so I thought that you might ... That 's ... that 's very thoughtful of you , Milton . It just ... Rain check ? Sure . Yeah , I understand . I 'll put that check with the others . See you later . I 'd love to . You would ? Love to what ? Have dinner . You would ? Well , okay , then . No more rain checks . I will pick you up at 8 : 00 , promptly . See ya . Here 's the thing . See that girl right over there ? Yeah . Stop ! Go talk to her . I 'm sorry , but your beautiful smile has entirely distracted me . Okay , no make-out session in front of your friends . You worried about the eclipse tomorrow ? Yeah . I mean , they say that millions of people died . Hey , don 't worry , okay ? I mean , there 's been so many eclipses since , and no monsters . Yeah . You know , I 'm staying with my dad this weekend . - Yes . - And your parents are off to Palm Springs . - Yes . - Well ? Are you asking me out on a date ? Yes , I am . I mean , as long as you don 't have other plans . Stop . - You think your dad will let you ? - Yeah . I mean , he 's pretty cool . My mom doesn 't think so , but he 's a lot less parental than my mom . And controlling . What happened between them ? Me . Well , and the reckoning , but ... I don 't know . They just kinda split up after I was born . But it 's like , " what are you gonna do ? " , you know ? I just try not to think about it . Well , at least your parents are around . - Yeah ? - We need you down here right away . We just went red . Today 's there 's been major seismic activity below the two-mile line over the last eight hours , and it 's converging . The other facilities have confirmed activity , too . I don 't think this is a drill . This is the real deal , and we are a go on containment . Chief . I don 't think this one 's a drill . I don 't know , man . But we 'll be ready this time . Ain 't something I 'm inclined to go through again . It 's all good , yeah ? Honestly , I think it 's broken . Hey . How 's it going ? Good . It 's good to see you , too . - Where 's your mom ? - In the kitchen . - Hey , Laura . - Hey . Sorry I missed you last month . And the month before that . And the month before that . It 's okay . You look good . You ... heard about the eclipse on Saturday , yeah ? - Yeah , everyone has . - And you 'll be with him for it , right ? Yeah , yeah . But I 'm not looking to have a heartfelt conversation about what happened 15 years ago , if that 's where this is going . That 's not where this was going . Why do you always do that ? You always turn everything back on me . I don 't do that , Laura . You do that . Really ? I 'm just here for our son . - Honey ? - Yes , I am ready . I 'm actually waiting on you guys with my bag at the door . Are you done ? - Do you see this ? Do you see what you do ? - I know . - I love you . - I love you , too , Mom . Have fun and be safe . I want him home Sunday evening , please . Yeah . - Can I drive ? - No . Jiminy Christmas ! We lost grid 7 ! Oh , man ! They don 't pay me enough for this , man ! Copy , copy . If it 's Mom , I 'm asleep . - Yo . - Dave ? Dave , it 's Uncle Ted . You know what 's going on ? - You gotta listen to me very carefully . - It 's like one in the morning , Ted . What the hell does that matter ? Stella sent you a map in an email . It 's Uncle Ted . No , no comprende . Speak slowly . Pretend like you 're talking to an idiot . Apparently I am , smart ass . I 'm talking about what 's happening . I 'm talking about another event . You got till about midday tomorrow to wrangle up your family and get your ass up here to Barstow before the eclipse . What we 're reporting now is a second mass die-off in the Gulf of Mexico within hours of the Norway event , which scientists say is eerily similar to the events preceding the Day of Reckoning . Hey , Dad ? Dad , you 're gonna want to come see this . The second sign will be a mass migration . - It 's happening all over the world again . - Fears mount for the second precursor that would signal another event like the one 15 years ago . - The final sign ... - The eclipse . It 's God 's way . The world has become very evil . This is his way of cleansing his world . It 's his world , after all . He created it . We were given a warning ... Ted ? David , it 's Laura . Have you seen the news ? Yeah , of course . It 's been on all night . David , please . Please , I want you to bring Tyler home . - Milton 's made arrangements at a shelter . - Laura , you can trust me . I 'm his father . He 's safe here . I don 't trust this house . He 'll be safer with us . Us ? That is not ... that is not what I meant . Can you not do this right now ? This is not a joke . I want you to bring Tyler home now ! Okay , yeah , you win . I 'll ... Yeah , I 'll bring him over right now . As soon as he 's done with what he 's doing . - What do you mean ? What is he doing ? - Yeah , he 's working on a project right now . It 's for school . I 'll have him right over . What is this ? " 555-2674 . " 555-2674 . 555-2674 . Tyler , Tyler , Tyler , buddy . All right . Come in . Laura , everything 's been prearranged with the shelter , but we gotta get there early before it fills up . I can 't find Tyler . That 's okay . We got time . Let me show you a trick . Where 's your computer ? It 's right there . That your phone ? - That 's his number ? - Yeah . - Skate park . - Yeah . How could it happen on such a beautiful day ? - You think we 'll see tomorrow ? - Don 't say that . Maybe it won 't even happen . And you know what ? If it does , we 'll hide . A lot of people survived . Don 't leave me . Not even for a mondo board with spitfires . Hey . You know , my mom , she says my dad wasn 't there for her when she needed him most . I won 't do that to you . I promise . Holy crap . Look at that . It 's the second sign . They 're swarming everywhere ! Come on . What the hell is going on ? Oh , my God . Maybe I should reconfirm our reservations at the shelter . Let 's go . Yes , this is Milton Sing . S-i-n-g . I have a reservation for five . Back online . Carl ! Please ! Please ! No ! Tyler ! Tyler ! Dad ! - I oughta wring your neck , buddy . - I 'm sorry . She had nowhere else to go . I 'm so sorry , Mr. Shepherd . - Wait . What is that ? - Emergency sirens . - I didn 't know we had those . - Yeah , me neither . Come on , let 's go . - Uncle Ted ... - My skateboard . We 'll get it later . Uncle Ted 's got some kind of bunker in the desert . We need to get your mom and get out of the city . Come on , this way . - Tyler ! - Hey , speak of the devil . - Tyler ! - Yeah , let 's get in . All right , come on , let 's get in . Perfect timing , Laura , as always . - Hey , Milton . - David . You know your way to Barstow ? We 're going to the Topanga Shelter . I told you Milton made arrangements . We have a little over an hour , you guys . Right . An hour it is . You know your way to Topanga , Milton ? Yes , I know my way to Topanga , David . - I just don 't remember going this way . - David , please . - How far ? - We 're fine , we 're fine . Shit . He 's coming ! Lucifer ! Come on , come on . We 're not gonna make it . - We are gonna make it . - That 's just her being positive . Repent your soul ! There it is . Step back ! Women and children only ! Women and children only ! Step back !

You 're not listening to me , okay ? He called yesterday and made arrangements . Women and children only . Women and children only ! Women and children only ! Back up , sir . Step to the side , sir ! Women and children only ! - You take care of your mom , okay ? - No , no , I 'm not leaving you . - I 'm so sorry . - It 's okay . Go . - It 's fine . Go , hurry . - Dad , I 'm not gonna ...

You got it . - It 's gonna be okay . - He 'll be fine . - We gotta go . - You can 't do this ! You can 't separate us ! - Sorry , sir . Women and children only . - Come on , David , we gotta get out of here . Come on . - Please . Hurry up . - Hold up , hold up . No , I 'm sorry . - Tyler ! - Tyler ! Tyler ! - No , Tyler ! Damn it ! - I 'm not gonna leave you ! - No ! He 's my dad ! I 'm gonna stay with him ! - Listen to me ! Please come in . That 's it ! Shelter 's full ! No more people ! We are at capacity ! Hey , shelter is full ! No more people ! - We are at capacity ! - Sir , please listen to me ! I have my family here . We made arrangements . - We are at capacity ! - Never mind ! Let 's go ! Laura , come on ! - You 're not listening to me ! - Laura , let 's go ! Ty , go ! Let 's go . We gotta find shelter now . - There are women here , and children ! - Let 's go . Come on , let 's go . No more people ! No more people ! I 'm sorry . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . - They 're not picking up ? - No . - It 's going straight to voicemail . - Yes , it 's going straight to voicemail . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . David , are you sure about the house being reinforced ? No , I just said that . Breathe , Laura . We can still make a run for Ted 's place in the desert . The desert ? Are you kidding me ? We 'll never make it . We 'll take the back roads , avoid the highway . We 'll be out of the city . We have ten minutes . We have to find somewhere now . I know where we 're going . We 're gonna go to the school . It 's only a few minutes away . - We have a secure basement . - That place will be mobbed by now . That basement isn 't secure . There 's ten different ways in , kids go in there to make out . Young man , just trust me . It 's gonna be fine ! - It 's the place to go ! - The basement isn 't secure ! Okay , everybody , just calm down ! Just breathe and calm down . We 'll be fine ! It 's a secure basement . - Milton . - Is he still not picking up ? - What do we do ? - It 's all stopped . - Nobody 's moving . - What is going on ? - What 's happening ? - I can 't go anywhere . We 'll figure it out , guys . Laura , go see if there 's a door . Tyler , see if there 's some opening . See if there 's anywhere to hide . - Come on , there 's a door there . - I 'll go over here . Yo , Dad ! I don 't know what to do ! It 's locked up . I can 't get in . - I know . Get in the car . - Guys , we gotta go now ! They 'll tear the school apart . We gotta get out of the city . I know the way to the L.A. River . We can take it all the way to the dirt . - I 'll drive . - Let me drive ! Hey ! I got it . No ! No ! You 're not gonna get me killed today ! This is my car ! Milton ! Milton ! Milton ! Get in the car . Get in the car . Dad , go , go ! Drive , drive , drive ! Oh , my God . - Anything ? - No . - Maddie , you still with us ? - Yeah . We 're gonna be okay , all right ? All of us . - How far is Ted 's ? - Hundred miles or so . Hey , it 'll get us out of the city , all right ? Do we have weapons or anything ? Does salt really kill them ? Yes . And cold . Why would God do this to us ? I mean , is this really a part of his plan ? Honey , we 're not ... we 're not sure where these things come from . Nobody knows why they 're here or what they want . We call them demons , but that 's just one of many theories . Some say it 's God 's will . - Are they here to test us ? - Maybe . Others think they 've just been here for a very , very long time , just hibernating . Just waiting . Is that what you believe ? I don 't know anymore . - What ? What was that ? - We need to find a new car . - What ? - How much further ? 20 miles or so . You don 't know . Hey , it 's not my car , Laura . I didn 't fill it up . We just gotta find a new car . Dad , what is going on ? We need a new ride . - Hey , what about that one ? - Yeah . Everybody stay here . Laura , get behind the wheel . If you see anything , just get out of here . Drive . Be safe . Is there someone in there ? Just stay calm . - Jesus , look at that . - Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Mom , no . You 're gonna catch his attention . Go , go , go , go ! - Where is it ? - We 're close . Oh , man . This is it . All right , Ted . Told you guys . Teddy , we are here ! - Hey , Uncle Ted ? - Knock again . Ted ! - Uncle Ted ! - I know you can hear us . We 're here . - Hello ? - Ted , buddy ! Can you hear me , Ted ? Uncle Ted . Ted , hey , I know you 're in there . Open up . Uncle Ted , can you hear me ? - Teddy ! Teddy ! - Is there another way in ? - Is he even inside ? - Yeah , he 's in here . I 'm just gonna grab a rock . See if you can get his attention in the big one . Ted ! - He 's in there . - It 's Laura . Open up . We 're here . Ted ! He 's in here . - Dad , are you sure he 's in there ? - Yes . Ted ! Ted ! Yeah , it 's motion activated , it 's just gotta ... it 's gonna alert him . Ted ! Ted ! Come on , Ted . Come on , buddy . I know you 're in there . Dad , what are we supposed to do ? You guys just keep trying over here . I 'm gonna ... - Just keep banging on that door . - Dad ! Ted ! Hello ? - Man ! - Ted ! - Are you sure that this is the right place ? - Yes . I just talked to him . Dad . Dad , Mom , they 're coming ! They 're coming ! - I know ! Goddamn it ! - David ! He 's here ! Come on . Try the door again . Try the main door . Try the main door . Find something . Just ... David ! David ! Okay . Come on , come on . Come on , come on . Ty , give me a hand . Stand on it . - Uncle Ted , please let us in ! - David , they 're here ! - We gotta go now ! - Get back , get back . Uncle Ted , if you can hear me , please just open the door . Please open the door , Uncle Ted . - Dad ! - David , get in ! Dad , Dad , Dad , it 's open ! It 's open ! Come on ! Go , go , go ! - Go , go , go ! - Close it , close it , close it ! - Everybody okay ? - We 're good . Ted . Ted ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't hear you until you started banging . Awesome place , Ted . Saltwater sprinklers . Thanks , kid . - Hi , I 'm Maddie . - Hi , Maddie . Nice to meet you . - Thank you so much . - Stella , hey . I 'm glad you made it . Laura , oh , my gosh . I 'm so glad you 're here . David , you were supposed to be up here before the eclipse . David , this is Garrett . Corporal Garrett Jensen . Homeland Security . David Sheppard . That 's my kid Tyler , and his mom , my ex-wife . Garrett 's father and I were in the Gulf War together . I got ... I got separated from my unit . Lucky for me , I remembered good old Ted here had this place , so ... here I am . That was lucky . - My sidearm bothering you , friend ? - Guns make me nervous . Ain 't that the point ? They gonna do that all night ? Yeah , they probably will now . The buzzards know we 're here . Nothing is getting in here without an invitation . I can attest to that . If I was you , I think I 'd feel lucky to be in here at all . This is one of those days that no one should have to live through , let alone a second time , but we are going to . We 're gonna survive this . All of us . Now how about we get dinner started ? Burn through some time here . You guys made it just in time for one of Stella 's all-time special recipes . - Right , baby ? - I guess so , if you like stew . - Laura , would you mind helping me ? - Plenty of stew for everyone . What ? Yeah . That would be great . Is anyone listening ? Pardon me . The world 's gonna be a different place by morning . It 's gonna be a long night . Give me a hand with this . Can they see us through the walls ? Like by heat or something ? - That 's not how it works . - How 's it work then ? I don 't know exactly . Like they say , movement , light . You know what I think ? I think they see right into you . Right into your soul . I think it 's crystal clear that these things are the devil 's work ... and therefore , creatures of God . They 're here to test us . Test you . Test your spirit . Test your guts . They might tear your flesh , but they 're feeding on your soul . Are you a religious man , corporal ? I am today . Were you in the military during the first Day of Reckoning ? I was ... I was on a refinery 15 years ago . Down south in Louisiana when the first one hit . They ... they come right up , right up from underneath us . Black things with black eyes , clawing and tearing . 157 of us on that rig ... and all of them ... I ran . Ran right into this refuse pond right out back , and it was so thick with salt , it was like mud . And I just buried myself ... in that white slop . I could see them in the skies though , charging and stomping , attacking anything that moved . Millions . Millions . So I stayed there , just watching . All my workmates , all my friends ... just getting eaten alive . But ... that 's why they call it the Day of Reckoning . It 's the day God gives to the devil . How about some of us try to get some sleep ? Yeah , sure . Yeah , I think a little shut-eye might be good for us all ? I 'd be happy to take the first watch . And I 'd be happier to have another touch of that intoxicating whiskey , miss Stella . How about a game of cards ? - Yeah , sounds good . - You guys play . I 'm beat . Come on , Laura . One game . You and me versus Ted and Stella . It 'll be fun . I 'm good . You guys play . I 'm beat . Good night , guys . Laura , just one game . I don 't think he wants you to go to sleep . All right , why don 't we all just relax ... Okay . This is what we call " military intervention . " Now , why don 't you just put that knife back on the table there , friend ? - What the hell is this ? - He 's been holding us hostage , Laura . Did you just clue into that ? Ted , he was ... he was not gonna let me in , but Stella , she 's got a real soft heart , bless her . Bless her . Alright , I just need the shelter for the rest of the night . - Then we can all go our separate ways . - Why don 't you just calm down ? - I 'm really losing my patience with you . - Hey , we 're all in here together . This is crazy . No one 's gonna do anything . - Why 'd you have that knife ? - It 's down now . Just put down the gun . You know what 's going on out there . You don 't wanna bring that in here , right ? No one 's done anything to you . I 'm starting to feel like I 'm ... I 'm not really welcome here anymore . Yeah , okay , think about it , right ? What are you gonna do ? You gonna shoot us ? Start piling up carcasses in here ? - You don 't think they 're gonna smell that ? - I 'll do whatever I gotta do . I survived the last one , okay ? I can survive the next one . Yeah . All right . Nice try . Nice try , really . Ain 't gonna be no heroes today , okay ? - Now ... - Quiet ! - Listen . - What ? I 'm not hearing anything , right ? I mean , where did they go ? It 's too quiet . Well , it works on vampires . It 's gonna be all right , baby . Dad ! All right , get down , get down . Tyler , get over here and tie him up . Tie his hands . - Laura , find where it came in . - Oh , my God . She needs medical attention now . Stella , look at me , honey . You 're gonna be okay , okay ? - We don 't have much time . - Stella , honey , look at me if you can . I 'm right here , okay ? - Sorry , we gotta wrap ' er up , we gotta go . - We 're not leaving , damn it . I can 't help her out there . - It 's okay , Stella . - I 'm okay , I 'm okay . I can do it . I can do it . We won 't last two minutes when they get in here . - Those doors will hold . - Not for eight hours . We 're running out of time . There 's a back tunnel ... leads to the canyon on the north side . Good cover . You go . Y 'all just gonna leave me here ? Ted , you know what 's happening to me . You can 't stay here , baby . I got a vehicle . I hid it in the valley about two miles away . I didn 't tell Ted ' cause I didn 't think he 'd let me in if he knew I had a ride . - Another goddamn lie ! - For survival , Ted ! It 's called the Day of Reckoning , not the day of let 's all just be best friends . It 's got a full tank of gas . I can get you a long way from here . And go where ? The gate . The gate 's about ... - it 's only 12 miles away . - The gate ? That 's your idea ? The gate ? - That 's where these monsters came from . - They 're not there anymore . It 's a secure facility , and they got safe rooms for personnel , but I can get you all in . All of y 'all . - You got a better idea ? - Why didn 't you mention this before ? I got cut off . I told you that ! They 'll have medical attention there . All right . Let 's go . You get us to your facility in one piece , maybe we 'll forget about tonight . - Right ? - I 'll get you there . Shotgun . - I call it . - Rock salt rounds . Grenade launcher . Street sweeper . Hey . You never know . I 'm good . It 's time . - How much further , friend ? - I 'd say it 's about a couple clicks . - That 's military speak for a kilometer . - Yes , smart ass , I know what that is . Just keep on point . - I 'm fine . - You 're okay . You 're okay . I could help y 'all carry stuff if I wasn 't tied up . You don 't need your hands to walk , corporal . Keep moving . Think we can trust him ? Yeah , for now , as long as we 're all at risk . You know ... I just ... - What ? I didn 't say anything . - It 's just your timing . As always , it 's ... Well , not everything revolves around your schedule . Are you guys seriously gonna do this right now ? We should be in that shelter right now with everyone else . Not out here , like last time . - This isn 't like last time . - Why ? ' Cause you 're actually here ? - Mom . - Sorry , buddy . - Tyler ... - It 's dead . Yeah , it doesn 't matter . Stand back . Get back over here . Looks like it 's in pain . Like it 's screaming or something . It 'd be a really cool Instagram . Come on , get your stuff . Let 's go . Maddie ! Sorry , I 'm coming . Help me , Tyler ! Maddie , Maddie , Maddie ! Come here ! Come here ! Maddie , no ! No ! No , no , no . Let 's go . Let 's go . Go , go , go , go ! David , I can help . Come on , let 's go . You gotta be kidding me . What was that ? - What ? - Jinn . I set that kill switch . - Start the car . - Come on ! Start the car . I forgot I hit the kill switch . Stella ! No ! Stella , please ! Stella , please ! Stella ! No ! Give me the gun . No , Stella , no . Don 't do that , Stella . Stella , don 't do that . Don 't . Don 't , Stella , no . Don 't you dare ! Give me the gun , Stella . Give me the gun , Stella ! No ! No ! Give me the gun . Stella , please , give me the gun . Give me the gun , baby . Give me the gun , honey . Give it ... give it to me ! Come here , Stella . Stella , come to me . - Ted , that 's enough . - Come here . No ! Come here ! Stella ! Stella ! Come here ! We gotta go . They 're coming . They 're coming . Come on , get in ! Go , go ! Now ! Now ! Go ! Go ! - We gotta go ! We gotta go ! - Stella ! - Drive ! - Stella ! Stella ! Stella ! - Come on , go ! - No ! Drive now ! Now there 's been no break in the attacks so far . The whole area was under siege throughout the night . Evacuation centers did not hold , and Topanga Shelter was leveled during the attack . Our early reports indicate that there has been mass destruction of multiple safety zones in that area . Unit five-four-niner to base . I 'm carrying wounded civilians . Over . This is five-four-niner . Do you read ? Over . Anybody there ? Why would they have the door open ? I don 't know . Let 's go see . Do you mind ? I thought you said someone would be here . There should be , unless something went wrong . Where is everyone ? I don 't know what happened . Maybe they 're all in safe rooms . - Where are those ? - Lower level . Basement . Ted . Your back . What the hell ? - It 's nothing . - Do you guys got a hospital here ? Not at this end , but there 's a supply room . Downstairs . All right , corporal . Down we go . We gotta get this power back on , so we can actually get into the safe rooms . - Get me to the machine room . I can do it . - It 's up here on the left . I 'll show you . And medical 's all the way down the hall . Come on , Maddie . Hey , go with them . I 'll ... I 'll catch up after I get this knocked out . Are you ready , sweetheart ? They 've been fracking this hole for years , flooding it with saltwater as a defense measure . They even pulled a mountain of salt from the local flats , but ... the hole 's too deep . They kept us on standby in case it ever happened again . Oh , great . - Laura , will you grab that ? - Careful . Careful , careful . How does it look ? - Hey . - Not too bad . Go , Dad . - You 're pretty handy . - Let 's go find those guys . Get down to a safe room . This is gonna sting just a little bit , okay ? Where is he ? We should hurry it up . - You see him ? - Hey . They 're inside the facility . We need to get somewhere secure . - We only have two hours left . - That can be a long time . There 's a storage room where we first come in . Volatile chemicals , so the doors are blast proof . Good . Let 's go . How 's he doing ? David ! Gun ! - Hey ! What the hell ? - Hey ! I 'm sorry . Come on , come on , let 's go . Okay . Go , go , go . Come on , come on , come on . We good ? - We good ? - Yeah . What are we gonna do ? - Water pipes ? - These are the dispersal lines here , so the circulation tank must be somewhere on the other side of this wall . God , David . - Yeah , this is the easy part . - What are you gonna do ? Even the odds . Come here . You 're doing a good job , buddy , okay ? I got one more job for you . You take care of your mom while I 'm gone . Okay , these pipes feed a salinization system somewhere in here . I 'm gonna redirect the saltwater to the circulation tank . What do you need from me ? - Keep my family safe . - I can do that . Hey . Is this really the time for that ? I 'll meet you guys back here . Just be safe . Be safe .

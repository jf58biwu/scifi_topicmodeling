 Baron von strucker thought that sunil bakshi Was well-groomed to serve , So why is he not present ? Man : Compliance will be rewarded . Your father was good once . He 's a monster . Just one dinner . [ chuckles ] Ethan . I hear you 're headed away . Taking some time to backpack . I need you to get me into fury 's toolbox . It 's way beyond anything I 've ever encountered . Without coulson , I 'm afraid it 's just a piece of junk . Are we having any issues following agent fitz ? You tailed him ? Maybe you could show me how to shake a tail . Like , now ? [ horn honks ] [ indistinct conversations ] [ tires screech , horns honk ] That won 't end well . Ohh . Get us in the air . Deathlok : Will do . Mike ? Hey , fitz . Good to see you again . New hardware . Hey , how did you upgrade - - Not now , fitz . Hunter : Strap in . Hey , those tips for evading the tail were very useful . Thanks . [ breathes sharply ] the toolbox ? Fitz : Yeah , it 's been a while Since I 've been in the field solo . Not since , um ... Well , looks like you held up all right . Yeah . Held up quite well , actually . And you ? Fitz , we need to find skye . Is that she was taken by the same powered man Who took raina and cal . Do we have any leads ? No , but hydra might . Hydra 's new heads - - strucker and list . My sources say they 're researching powered people . Apparently , they 're even more obsessed than whitehall . We need to know what they know - - get into hydra . Desperate times , desperate measures . Count me in . I 'm relieved to hear you say that . We 're making a deal ... With ward . Woman : Ethan johnston , 26 , potential enhanced . Died of cardiogenic shock In the 37th hour of experimentation . Still no quantum signature ? No , dr . List . That 's a waste . Take the cadaver to the lab . Compare him to the other samples . Hail hydra . [ birds chirping ] Cal : I told you I 'd put our family back together . Yes , you did . Last night was ... Something - - Almost exactly as I imagined it . Some things were different . She 's still afraid of me . Whose fault is that , cal ? No , I know . I know . You 're right . I just - - I-I wish she could have known me Back when we were first married , when I was calm And my - - my mind wasn 't so ... Jumbled . We 've both changed . We 're not the people we used to be . To lament that is a waste of time . You 're right . She 's here now - - with us , right ? [ chuckling ] that 's pretty cool , right ? Me being here puts you in a tough spot - - I know . I-I know . I see the stink-eye from everyone . They know you 're not like us . They 're wondering why you 're here . I don 't want to make things harder for you . I 'll stay here , be quiet , And wait for our next family dinner . Hey , how about next time , we grill , huh ? Whatever you like . In the meantime , why don 't I have gordon Take you to pick up some of your belongings So that your time here is less ... Prison-like ? [ both chuckle ] That would be fan-frigging-tastic . I miss my tunes . [ chuckles ] Sorry . I wish I didn 't have to , but ... [ clears throat ] Is it my go ? You 're about a million miles away . [ sighs ] sorry . I 'm back at dinner . Dinner with my parents can stress me out , too . [ sighs ] It wasn 't stressful , exactly . I mean , I didn 't want to see cal , Let alone be in the same room as him . I was sure he was gonna have some twisted surprise , But he didn 't . It was ... Nice . That 's good . [ chuckles ] isn 't it ? Did jiaying tell you that she 's sending cal away ? He 's not coming back . He doesn 't exactly belong here . You think it 's a bad idea . It 's not a good one . He 'll get upset , and someone will get hurt . Talk to her . She 's your mom . [ chuckles ] [ chuckles ] It 's nice having someone normal to talk to . [ chuckles ] [ electricity crackles ] You hit me . [ grunts ] Finally , an actual partner . [ grunting ] [ grunts ] Little tip - - could have avoided losing your footing If you would have flipped into it . Now you 're just making fun of me . It 's not like I can bench-press a small hatchback . Yeah . We all have our talents . Aah ! How 's simmons doing on fury 's toolbox ? You ask me - - she 's stalling . Maybe . [ both grunting ] It doesn 't bother you ? Ohh . I 'm out . It bothers me that we 've been so focused on coulson I mean , we have a - - have a tail on fitz , for god 's sakes . It 's not like hydra 's gone . Coulson may be a lot of things , but he 's not the enemy . You sound like hunter . Well , he might have been right on this one . Yeah , I 've been wondering that myself . The only way to move forward right now Is to get the truth out . Any idea how to get the truth out of fury 's toolbox ? It 's flying in from the aircraft carrier as we speak . They 're bringing in some state-of-the-art , Next-gen fiber laser . That can cut through vibranium ? If anything can . It 's time we have it all out in the open . [ door closes ] It 's not exactly quite so simple . Simmons , what did you do ? I duplicated the box - - Switched out fury 's real box for a fake , I 've been pretending to be working on it , when - - Where is the real box now ? Fitz has it . I didn 't know who else to turn to . The - - you 're the only one I can trust here anymore . I 'll handle it . Kara : Thanks for the picture - - Really helped clear some things up . Wait , mom , what men ? When exactly did they call ? Okay , if they call again , don 't say a word . I 've got to go - - call when I can . [ dialing ] Agent 33 . You 're looking well . [ dogs barking in distance ] [ car door opens ] [ cellphone ringing ] Hey , baby . Coulson : Hey , sweetie . Why don 't you drop by ? Love to catch up . That mask on your face - - Got any more of those lying around ? Afraid not . At least I have my winning personality . They didn 't hurt you , did they ? No , I 'm okay . You shouldn 't have come . Fact that this guy hasn 't killed me yet means they need me . Mike . Ward . Turn around . You know what needs to happen . All of it . [ metal clinks ] [ sighs ] I 'm flattered - - bringing the robot along There 's no need for false modesty . We both know you 're that good . But frankly , this isn 't about you . I 'm after bigger fish - - strucker , list . Can 't help you - - not in hydra anymore . But you were . Even then , I only knew them by reputation - - [ scoffs ] again with the false modesty . You 're resourceful . Bet you know a guy who knows a guy . You know , last time I suggested we work together , You called me a deluded son of a bitch . Things change . I 'm offering you a deal - - help me , And I 'll let you walk away , free and clear - - No more looking over your shoulder . When something 's too good to be true , it 's a lie . I tried the stick with you before - - It didn 't work so well , so I 'm offering a carrot . I 'm listening . Get me inside . After that , I put you through the tahiti protocol , And then you 're free to go . Wipe my memories . Well , that sounds like a threat , not a carrot . I like who I am . A murderer and a traitor . Sorry . My offer 's the only way you leave here . I 'm taking a huge chance . You could have run . You risked your freedom for her - - that says something , Says that maybe there 's still good left in you . Maybe garrett , your family didn 't destroy all that . Tahiti will erase all the bad , Let you be the man you want to be , start over . Free and clear . I give you my word as director of s.H.I.E.L.D. I might know a guy . [ simmons scoffs ] no , no , no , no . I 'd just hoped the highly modified hydrofluoric acid Might cr- - stop . I told her the truth . Truth about what , exactly ? Fitz replaced fury 's toolbox with a fake , Ran off with the real one , And you 've been covering for him since . Nobody 's happy about it . I understand you 're confused - - Who to trust , where to put your loyalties . Yes , I am . But we 've lost coulson , the box , and fitz . Eventually , I 'm gonna have to tell gonzales And the rest of the board what happened . Unless we can find coulson another way . You know mike peterson 's hardware . You want me to try to tap into his feed ? Will that be a problem ? An opportunity to exonerate coulson and fitz ? No , it 's not a problem . I 'll keep you updated . [ crickets chirping ] [ sighs ] This is crazy . [ chest closes ] We want to find skye , yes , okay ? But we are making a deal with ... The devil . I 'm afraid it 's in the job description , mate - - Expedient alliances with despicable characters . You 'd work with bobbi ? No , not a chance . And point made . Look , mate , we 're infiltrating hydra . Our options are limited . Ward is a psychopath , but for now , he 's our psychopath , So we use him to stay one step ahead . [ birds chirping ] I 've searched the records - - no mention of precognition . Raina could be the first of her kind . I was . A gift like hers could change everything . Imagine - - she could warn us of threats before they happen . If that is her gift . [ knock on door ] Ah , sorry . I didn 't mean to interrupt . No , we 're finished here . I 'll let you know how it goes . Was that about cal ? I want to talk to you about that . Cal 's dangerous , I know , But he 's better when he 's with us . That may be true , but he can 't stay here . Well , can we give him a heads-up or ... And risk how he gets ? You think you 've seen him at his worst . You haven 't . You know how he 'll get when gordon just abandons him In the middle of nowhere . Not nowhere - - we 're taking him home . He will feel abandoned , and people will get hurt . Those people aren 't my concern . Well , they 're mine . I 'm a s.H.I.E.L.D. Agent . The longer he stays , the more attention he draws , The more attention he demands . I can 't make exceptions . He 's not one of us . Sometimes , as a leader , I have to do things I 'd rather not do . Get the package ? Just like they said . I still don 't trust them . Hell , no , but we need them to trust us . Ward : Something 's not right . Why isn 't may here ? There 's something coulson 's not saying . Which is why we should make a run for it . The idea of them wiping away who you are ... Hey , no one 's gonna wipe anything . We have the upper hand . Whatever coulson 's endgame is doesn 't matter Because he is gonna help us get to ours . [ insects chirping ] What 's this ? Thought we could put that on the windowsill . It 's beautiful . It 's too bad . I liked our house . It won 't be our last - - promise . At the end of this , you 'll be home . And we 'll be together . [ knock on window ] deathlok : Break it up . Let 's go . This just gets better and better . Huh ? Ward : Not to worry . We are working with director coulson . You 're gonna do whatever he says - - understand ? Of course . I 'm more than happy to comply . Get him out of there . [ knock on door ] [ sighs ] Hey . Um ... Sorry . Uh , I was expecting gordo . He can 't like you calling him that . [ chuckles ] Oh , he loves it . Uh , come in . Uh , so , I was , uh , gonna find you today , But , um , I-I didn 't want to overdo it after last night . I-I tend to overdo - - big overdoer . Oh , so I guess you heard I 'm gonna be out of here for a little bit . Yeah , I heard . Hey , you want to put in an order ? I 'll bring you back something from the mainland - - Gossip mags , soda pop . Do you like funyuns ? [ chuckling ] I 'm - - I 'm okay , thank you . So , where are you going - - china ? What makes you think I 'd go there ? No . God , no . Oh , I-I 'm sorry . Jiaying said that you were going home , So I just assumed that - - that - - Oh , oh , of course . No , that makes sense . No , I was in china volunteering for doctors without borders . Wow . Hard to picture that , right ? I was supposed to be there two weeks , But I met your mother and I couldn 't leave . She stole my heart . No , home is , um , milwaukee . That 's where we were gonna bring you up . I should take you there sometime - - I don 't know - - Maybe show you around the old haunts . Why not tomorrow ? I want to go with you . Okay . Best day ever ! Yeah . You can 't just leave him on the side of the road It 's irresponsible and cruel for both a puppy or cal , And cal 's not a puppy - - he 's a pit bull , A raging pit bull who will attack if he doesn 't - - I don 't want to hear about the people You think you 're responsible for . This isn 't about them . This is about me . You asked me to be decent - - give cal one dinner . I did that . And I ... Empathize . After one night , you understand him ? Because I spent my entire life searching for you . I lied and I broke laws just to get the - - The tiniest sliver of information . And I had no memories of my family . Cal had memories . He knows what he lost . Listen , I 'm I 'm not asking you to let him stay . Just let me go with him . I 'll talk to him . I 'll soften the blow - - let him know I 'll visit And that ... He hasn 't lost us forever . [ engine rumbling ] Bakshi reached out - - arranged a meeting with dr . List . And are we sure we trust stepford bakshi ? " trust " might be a little strong . Bakshi 's been instructed to act Exactly as he would have ... Before . Oh , well , in that case , I feel comforted . Any questions ? Kara : How much longer ? Deathlok : A couple hours . So , fitz How 've you been ? Hey ! Hey , hey , hey ! Hey , hey , hey ! Sit down , agent fitz . Hey ! Bakshi - - no , he is - - he is - - he 's the exact same as ward . So he will double-cross us the second that he 's with hydra . Yes , he would - - if he was going in alone . He 's not ? He 'll have his bodyguard with him . We 'll monitor the entire meet through mike 's eye . Dr. List 's instructions were explicit - - Bakshi was to come alone . Luckily , bakshi 's good at talking his way out of things . Aren 't you ? I 've been told it 's one of my more useful skill sets , yes . See ? No problem . [ computer beeping ] [ keyboard clacking ] Any luck ? No . They were going to find out - - you know that . You do realize that it was my plan To switch the box - - not fitz 's ? I mean , he carried the plan out to perfection , But I handed him the schematics . I don 't care whose plan it was . You threw fitz to the wolves . To protect you . They raided the base for that box . You 're lucky you 're not in a cell right now . I can 't believe what I 'm hearing . You 're on their side . It 's not about sides - - it 's about the truth . Coulson left us with a mountain of lies , And the only way to understand his reasoning Was inside that box . Honestly , I don 't care what 's in it . The only thing I know Is that coulson was just trying to protect skye . [ electricity crackles ] Thanks , gordo . Now beat it . Cal . I 'll be back when you 're ready . We 'll let you know . [ electricity crackles ] Our first father-daughter date ! Though " date " might be the wrong word . Is that weird ? Is - - is this weird ? Yeah . It 's weird . It 's a little weird . So , did you have an apartment around here or ... ? Oh , I didn 't live here - - worked here . My office is , uh , over there . Oh , then where are we going ? I thought you said you had to grab some of your things . No , I told you I wanted to show you around . Thought we 'd get a pastry , get to know each other a little ? Sure . Who doesn 't love pastry ? Oh , there 's this great , little mom-and-pop bakery Just around the corner - - swedish place - - swiss - - I don 't know . I mix them up . What 's wrong ? You know what doesn 't have the smell of buttery goodness Wafting out of it on your way to work ? A currency exchange ? Got to be someplace to eat around here . So , you had a - - you had a practice here ? Yeah , before I met your mother . She was a doctor , too ? Studying to be one . She had a natural gift for it - - Compassionate , beyond intelligent , wise - - Always five steps ahead of me . She wanted to finish med school here . Oh , and there was this great , little charter school Just around the corner . A charter school for medicine ? [ chuckling ] oh , no , not for her - - for you . Oh , it was gonna be perfect . I was gonna drop you off every morning and pick you up , Help you with your science-fair project - - The volcano , because who doesn 't love a volcano , right ? We 'd go to the father-daughter dances together , Get ice cream . Ah , the life we could have had - - Should have had . Memory lane isn 't always that fun to visit . It 's okay . Come on . I 've got ice cream on the brain . [ keyboard clacking ] fitz : We are online . It 's good to see you alive and well , mr . Bakshi . Bakshi : Dr. List , a pleasure . You 're a difficult man to find these days . Hunter : Three men , heavily armed - - Bet there 's more where they came from . You got a cyborg on board with rockets in his arm . He 's not a cyborg - - he 's a s.H.I.E.L.D. Agent ... With rockets in his arm . Our world is much more complicated now After the tragic death of dr . Whitehall And the ensuing bloodbath that it caused . Thank you . Tell me , mr . Bakshi , Exactly how did you manage to escape unscathed ? Bakshi : What are you implying , doctor ? Well , most of hydra 's leaders Were wiped out in one fell swoop , I was just curious if you might know anyone involved . Let 's see how bakshi holds up under questioning . He 's held up to worse than this . You think I poisoned the baroness ? Killed bloom ? Someone put a bullet in his head . I assumed it was you ... Or strucker . You had the most to gain , And look - - here you sit , alive and well , With more money and manpower than ever . See ? Told you he was good . The truth is , I didn 't escape unscathed . I was captured by the u.S. Government . Mr. Peterson helped me escape . You do recognize him , don 't you ? Well , you should . Hydra invested quite a bit of funds Turning mr . Peterson into the perfect killing machine - - Money well-spent , I might add . What 's he doing ? He 's gaining list 's trust . Bakshi : I know strucker has been experimenting On powered individuals . I believe that with a compliance upgrade , Mr. Peterson would prove quite useful to him . You 're offering him To me ? Consider it a sign of good faith . This wasn 't the plan . What are you doing ? Getting us to strucker . Bastard sold us out ! [ guns cock ] Do you want to get to strucker or not ? Deathlok does , and he can take care of himself - - trust me . I ought to shoot you just for saying that . Um , sir . What if this goes south ? Would you have been willing to sacrifice mike ? That wasn 't your call to make . Is that deathlok 's targeting system ? Yes , he 's gonna - - he 's - - well , he - - He 's about to kill everyone . No , we need them alive . Fitz , tell mike to stand down . Yeah , no , that 's not gonna happen . Let him go , 33 . My name is kara , and I don 't work for you anymore . Weapons systems are hot . [ machinery whirring ] On the count of three , we all put our weapons down . Three ! [ breathing heavily ] [ machinery whirring ] You pull anything like that again , I 'll throw your ass off this quinjet at 20,000 feet . [ keyboard clacking ] Doctor , there 's been another incident . Excuse me . We 're close . Put us in the air . And then ... We 'll see quite how loyal You and your enhanced friend really are . They 're taking off . If strucker 's overseas , I 'd say that 's probably where they 're going . Then we tail them . Bookstores - - dead . Video stores - - dead . Old-fashioned ice-cream shops - - dead . The internet killed everything . I 'm not sure the internet killed ice cream , But , uh , how about we get a 40 ounce of malt liquor instead ? I 'm kidding , sort of . [ chuckling ] ah ! I learned something about you - - you 're funny . That 's good . Oh . Hey . Hey , where are your manners ? Apologize to my daughter . Hey . Hey . Calm down , okay ? Skye : I bumped him . Sorry . That was - - that was my bad . Yeah . You know what ? I bet they have ice cream . I 'll go see . [ dialing ] [ ringing ] May , it 's skye . I need to talk to coulson . Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm okay , but I don 't have much time . Where 's coulson ? He 's out , looking for you . Where have you been ? I 'm with cal , but I won 't be for long . And when I leave him , he 's gonna be pissed . And make sure he doesn 't hurt anyone . Skye , slow down . Look , there 's no time to explain . Please , it 's just too complicated . Just don 't hurt him . Skye , where are you ? Skye ? ! Cal : I got neapolitan and vanilla . Uh , you pick . We 'll have the location in a minute . She doesn 't sound like a hostage . More like she 's playing along . Mack and I can take a team - - go get them . Do it . You 're bored . Am I boring you ? You are a lot of [ chuckling ] things , But boring is not one of them . Tell you what - - let 's head over to my old office , okay ? There 's something there I want to show you - - something really special . Jiaying : Any word from lincoln ? Nothing yet . [ sighs ] they 've been gone a while . I regret letting her go , But at least lincoln 's there to protect her . Actually , there is something That needs your attention right now . It 's ethan . Ethan ? I thought you dropped him off on a camping trip . I did , but when I went to bring him back , he was gone . I can 't find him anywhere . Are you saying he 's missing ... Or worse ? I 'm not sure . But ... Even if they knew ... Who he was , That he was one of us , how can they get ahold of him ? Right now I 'm not concerned with how as much as who . We 're landing ? Already ? I thought strucker was in eastern europe . He is . But first , we 're making a stop . Have you heard of quantum entanglement , mr . Bakshi ? Well , we at hydra , for the last several months , actually ... Quantum entanglement ? Sounds like a method of torture . ... We have found incidents of photon intensity so great That particles can exist simultaneously in two spaces Over great distances . Never liked science or big words . But for something to be in two places concurrently - - This is a quantum entanglement bridge . We think it was created by a powered person , One we intend to capture . The teleporter - - they 're tracking the teleporter , The one that , um , took cal in wisconsin and - - and raina . And skye . This is about skye . Why would hydra want her ? Don 't know . Please , uh , excuse the mess ... And the , uh , the roaches . Johnson - - is that your last name ? Was . Pretty ordinary , huh ? I changed it to something more sinister when I went on the run . [ door hinges creak ] Daisy johnson . Huh . [ door hinges creak ] I , um , I had one of these . Coincidence ? I think not . Genetics . Keep it if you like . How is all this stuff still here ? I own the building . You own the building ? Mm-hmm , every wall , every bulb , every cockroach . [ inhales deeply ] I wasn 't rich , but you would have grown up quite comfortable . Had to shutter everything down after , uh - - well , you know . Only been back a few times over the years . So , this is like your stash pad , Where you keep all of your old stuff ? [ chuckling ] oh , I like that - - " stash pad . " Makes it sound better than a crappy office . My grandfather 's field kit from wwii . I used this to put your mother back together again . Truth is , her gift was the real healer . She 's a walking miracle , your mother . The way she suffered and endured and fought through it ... You still love her . How could I not ? I mean , I know she resented me for a time after we lost you , But I think now that we 're back together , that we can - - Please , stop . What ? What ? What 'd I say ? We 're not all back together . You can 't hang on to the past like this . You need to move on . We all do . Jiaying - - she 's responsible for all those people , and I ... I-I 'm an adult now . And as much as you want to turn back the clock To the time of science fairs and father-daughter dances ... They 're gone , yeah . I know . I know . But , look , it doesn 't mean that we can 't see each other . I could visit . Visit ? Where are you going ? [ door opens ] Who 's there ? Come out where I can see you . Relax . It 's just me . Lincoln . What are you doing here ? Jiaying sent me to make sure everything was cool . Why wouldn 't everything be cool ? What 's going on here ? Wait a minute . Y-you think daisy isn 't safe with me ? I didn 't say that . Just calm down . Don 't patronize me . Who the hell do you think you are ? I 'm her father ! Fan out . Alpha team ... If the teleporter is here , we want him alive . ... Six . 10-4 . Hail hydra . Cal , let me explain . No . What an idiot I 've been , huh ? I see what 's happening . You were gonna dump me here like yesterday 's trash . You don 't want to spend time with me . This isn 't daddy 's day out . This is goodbye . It 's not forever . It - - it - - skye , don 't . Her name is daisy ! Cal ! Well , what are you waiting for ? After everything I did for jiaying , for our family - - Years of searching , the pain , and the rejection ! Cal , I 'm warning you . Oh , you 're warning me ? Watch out ! [ electricity crackling ] [ groaning ] What 's s.H.I.E.L.D. Doing here ? It 's not s.H.I.E.L.D. - - It 's hydra . [ engines rumbling ] [ footsteps ] [ guns cock ] Get her out of here . I 'll take care of this . [ chuckling ] hey , hey , fellas , huh ? I can handle myself . No , don 't use your powers . You could bring the whole building down . I 'll help hold them off . Let 's not lose our heads , okay ? [ grunts ] Just go , please . Sir , skye - - skye 's here . Where ? 10th floor . The skye who shot you three times ? Four . [ gun cocks ] Don 't even think about it . You keep hydra off us . I 'll find skye . Lincoln : Hey . [ electricity crackling ] [ groaning ] aah ! [ panting ] what are you made of ? Whoever you are , you don 't want to do this . I 'm a friend of skye 's . Sure . And I 'm the hulk . Sir , deathlok 's down . I 've lost his feed . [ keyboard clacking ] [ computer beeping ] Uh . Uh , sir , I think somebody 's trying to hack into it . We need to split up ! We 'll cover you . Go find skye ! Where the hell is your boyfriend going ? Look out ! Aah ! [ groaning ] Skye ? Skye ! Who the hell 's that guy ? [ groans ] don 't know . Packs a mean spark . I think he 's protecting skye . Where is she now ? Can you scan the floor ? [ tablet beeping ] got him . Signal 's coming in . Deathlok : Optics are down . I think she went around that corner . Bloody hell . [ groans ] [ groans ] deathlok : Stay down , kid . I got this . Where the hell you been ? You missed all the fun . Not quite . Take them both . [ weapon powers up ] [ clanging ] [ pulsing ] [ whirring ] [ grunting ] Skye ? Coulson ? [ electricity crackles ] I need to get you out of here . No , no , no , no ! No , don 't go ! [ grunts ] I had her . Damn it ! I had her . [ gunshot ] Deathlok 's down . We 've got powered people on-site . Hydra 's storming the building . What happened to you ? Ah , it 's merely a flesh wound . We 're outmanned , outgunned , and our only backup is fitz . Your call , boss . We 'll return in a moment . Standard hydra issue . I 'd say we missed them by less than an hour . Hell of a fight , though . Looks like everyone cleared out . Coulson : Not everyone . I doubled back after hydra took off . Their cleanup crew really sucks , doesn 't it ? What the hell happened here , coulson ? I 'll tell you all about it back at the base . Take me to your leader .

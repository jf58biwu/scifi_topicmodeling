Or a funeral . I gave you a direct order . Shoot . I am not going anywhere with you . I found your daughter lying in a pool of her own blood , shot by your guards , under your order ! My children were lined up to be murdered and sent to the ovens , along with thousands of desperate people all so you can keep the lights on for your select few . You don 't know the virus was spreading ! So you get decide who lives and who dies ? ! There was panic , Captain , and I remained calm . Everybody was fleeing underground , but I stood firm ! There was no plan and I built this . I 'm the reason these people have survived this long . Except when you had the cure in hand , you wouldn 't stop ! You continued killing . It 's over . Your grand social experiment is history . I 'm offering you the chance . Surrender with honor . And who will judge me ? You ? Not me . A jury of your peers . Pick up the radio . Stand down your troopers . Shut down Olympia . Turn away your helo and come peacefully . It 's the only way for you now . Th-This is Amy- - This is Amy Granderson . Stand down . Cease and desist all operations at Olympia . Repeat- - Stand down . We are surrendering . I am not a monster . I am not . Dr. Hamada assured me that the cocktail provided a quick and painless death . I insisted on it . Nathan James , arriving . You saved it ? Not me . Doc Rios . And Quincy . Doc said to get that on ice ASAP . Right . Thank you , Holland . I got it from here . Sir . Yes , sir . Animals . You 'll stay here until I can find you a stateroom . I 'll use my at-sea cabin for now . And then what ? We 'll sort things out here in Baltimore . Then we head back home to Norfolk , so the crew can look for their families . And , from there , we 'll figure things out . So , this is home .

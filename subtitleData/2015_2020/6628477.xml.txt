 Previously on " Wayward Pines " ... Class One of the Academy . Well , congratulations . It 's a real honor . It 's a responsibility . And if you break the rules , you have to be reckoned . Without Kate Ballinger , they 're nothing . Reckon her , and you could stop all this . Look ... I told you I need to do things my way . You remember ... as the First Generation of this town , you are a leader now . They broke the rules and those rules exist for a reason ... Well , when is your dad gonna reckon them ? He 's not going to . We are just here to protect Wayward Pines . Get out ! - Unh ! - Oh , God ! Aah ! Ohh ! " Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines . " I love you . If you really want to protect them , you have to stop protecting me . I can 't do that . You have to put an end to this . There 's something I have to show you . It 's September 15 , 4020 . And Adam was just leading one group . There are hundreds . Believe me now ? I 'm not gonna kill Kate . And there 's one man behind it all . You know him as Dr. Jenkins . But his real name is David Pilcher . What happened to the power ? Paul , you have to calm down . It 's okay . We 're gonna get the power back on . We 're just trying to figure it out right now , all right ? All right , just ... just stay calm . What the hell is going on up there ? What happened to the lights ? Ethan , it 's Pam . David shut down the power grid . Is the power out at the fence , too ? Yes . Ethan , listen . You 've got to get those people off of Main . We 've tracked six Abbies inside the perimeter , God knows how many more behind them . Well , how much time do we have ? Just get them out of there . Copy . I 'm going to the hospital and getting Ben . All right . Good . Meet me at the bunker . All right . All right , everybody , listen up ! Listen ! We can 't stay here . It 's not safe , okay ? We got to start moving east . There 's an underground bunker at the corner of Boxwood and Third in a vacant lot under a shed . That 's where we 'll meet . Let 's go . Boxwood and third ! Let 's go ! All right . Hey , hey , hey , what happened ? Pilcher . He pulled the plug . The power 's down at the fence . Let 's go . We got to move . Okay , we need weapons . Where 's your group ? Tim ? Okay , you get everybody else . You meet us at the Sheriff 's station , all right ? Show me outside the perimeter . How much longer till power 's restored ? 20 minutes , maybe longer . I don 't know if we have that long . Wh-What 's going on ? Amy . Stop , stop . Don 't ... d-don 't try and move . Don 't try and move . I don 't understand . - What happened ? - Uh ... you had to go into surgery . Th-They found some bleeding or ... or something , I don 't ... I don 't know . It 's okay , though . You 're okay . Okay . I was so scared . I ... I didn 't want to lose you . Yeah , me either . You 're okay , though . Ben ? You guys , we have to get out of here . - What 's going on ? - Can she move ? I ... I don 't ... I don 't think so . I 'm not leaving her . I have to stay with her , Mom . I know , sweetheart . We 're not gonna leave her behind , okay ? Where 's Dr. Carol ? Hey , what 's going on out there ? Is the power out at the fence ? Oh , I 've got this , too . Um ... Franklin wasn 't finished yet , but I 'm pretty certain that it 'll detonate . You just , uh , arm these . This might come in handy . - Okay , no problem . - What 's going on ? Thank you both . David . - Pam . - Wha ... - My dear , dear Pam . - Wha ... Thank goodness you 're here . We need to discuss preparations for the awakening of Group " C. " Group " C " ? Those are our people out there . They 're gonna be killed , every last one of them . You 've got to turn the power back on . - You 've got to end this . - I can 't . It 's too late . I-I-I wish I could , but I can 't . This town we 've created , Pam , it 's too sick . They 're already dying . I failed them . I-I failed us . They 're lost , just as Group " A " was lost , but ... but we can begin again . In the winter , once the Aberrations have migrated , then we could start again from a clean slate . No more of this ... this decadence . No more Sheriff Pope or Ethan Burke . You were right about him . I was wrong . I made a mistake . And there will always be mistakes , David . But there is still time to fix this . - Perhaps . - Yes . If we learn , we can start again . We need to take more direct responsibility , you and I. Like the early days . We 're not talking about ideas here anymore , David . We are talking about actual , living human beings ! I followed you for years , down every road , blindly , but this is too far . You have not failed . Your great experiment is working . All you 've got to do now is just ... let it go . Turn the power back on , David . You send the guards down to help those people . Just end this . Yes . Yeah . The guards . The guards . We need the guards in here . In here ? What ... we don 't need you in here . - We need you to go down to into the ... - Take her to suspension . What are you doing ? Come on . David ! Unh ! David ! What ? ! David ! Everybody , hands in the air ! Hands up ! Up , up , up ! Everybody ! Hands in the air ! She 's doing well for a girl who just had major surgery , but we shouldn 't be moving her anywhere . She 's too weak . Oh , Doctor , we don 't have a choice . Ben , can you grab my stuff ? Okay , so , what can we do to keep her stable ? It 's the generator . Um , I 'll be right back . I 'll meet you at the bunker . Be careful . You too . All right , guys . Let 's get as many people off the street as we can . Pilcher always said this day would come . He warned us that one day , there would be a day of reckoning . And on that day , he would save the First Generation . But everyone else ... the weak ... would drown . Just like you . Just like your husband . We 're done here . Hey , you can 't just leave us in here ! Let us out ! Let us out ! ♪ Una furtiva lagrima ♪ ♪ Negli occhi suoi spunto ♪ ♪ Quelle festose ♪ ♪ Che piu cercando io vo ? ♪ ♪ Che piu cercando io vo ? ♪ Okay . We have to go now . We have to hurry . We have to hurry . Okay ? Okay , you guys ? Come on . Let 's go . Go on ! Oh ! Oh ! Run ! Go ! Now ! Get to the bunker ! Go ! How has he convinced you to do this ? Christina . I know you think you 're doing your duty . But you 're not . Things have gone terribly wrong . - We just ... - Do what she says and shut your mouth . Robert , this goes for you , too . It goes for all of us . Paul . We all gave up our lives in the old world to join David Pilcher on this journey of his . And it 's working . In town this year , there were more pregnancies than ever before in Wayward Pines . The future , our First Generation , that is the future for all of us , our duty to mankind . Not to David Pilcher . David is our Savior . David is not a Savior . He 's not a God . He 's just a man . And he 's made a mistake . But we can reverse this mistake . There 's still time . We can turn it around if we work togeth ... Pam ! Sir , maybe ... You should shut your mouth , too . Now ... put on your suits . Or we 'll put them on for you . Charlie ! Hey , keys . Where are the keys ? The keys ? In the gun locker over there ! Hurry ! Mike ! Come on . You all right ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? Did everyone make it to the Ark ? Most . Abbies are everywhere out there now . We should stay here . No , we can 't . We can 't . Remember , Pilcher entrusted us with the future of Wayward Pines . We have to make it to the Ark . Everything depends on it ... everything . Behind you ! Tim ! Run ! My gun is jammed . I 'm fine . Go ! Headed your way ! Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Hang on a second . Okay . Oh , my God . Shh . It 's okay . Shh . Shh . Stay there . Mom ! Ah ! - Is everyone okay ? - Yeah . - Let 's go . - Come on . Hurry up . Come on . Tim . Whew ! Be careful going down . All right . I got you . Ready . Okay . There you are . Come on . They 're coming . Okay . Those tunnels ... where do they lead to ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . Don 't play dumb with me . You 've been with him since the beginning . Where do they go ? I don 't know . Do you want everyone in here to die ? Because that 's what 's gonna happen . The best thing we can do right now is stay calm . David will rescue us . Rescue us ? ! What the hell are you talking about ? ! He wants us dead . You 're lying ! No , he 's not . You said yourself that Pilcher watches over us . So if he didn 't do this , where is he ? How come we weren 't warned ? David did this . You 've said this town is an ark . One crack , and we all drown . He is drowning us . Where do they go ? Megan ? We have no time . There 's a western tunnel . It leads to an elevator . I know the code . It will take you to the Mountain Complex ... to David . Good . Theresa . We 'll be right back . All right . This is it . How are we on ammo ? Uh , I 've got two mags . I 've still got these pipe bombs . We got to get everybody moving now . What if Pilcher sees us coming ? It doesn 't matter . We either deal with him or we deal with them . Let me get the others . All right . Here . Come back here . Ow . All right , that 's it . I 'm sorry about Harold . Thank you . You really loved him , huh ? You know , Pam set us up . We couldn 't have been more different . Seems impossible to think that we could , uh ... Anyway , um ... sometimes things just work out , I guess . Sometimes people surprise you . That 's the safety . You just flip it up and it 's ready to go . Okay . Um ... Dad , I just wanted to say I 'm sorry about before . At the hospital , I said some stuff ... I heard what you said . Look . You 're my son . I love you . We 're gonna get through this . Okay ? Okay . All right , everybody , let 's clear out . Let 's go . Come on . Yeah . - Careful . Come here . - Come on . Megan , come on ! I saw Reed and Tristan and Sarah out on Main Street . I 'm sure there are others . If they 're not here , they didn 't make it . You don 't know that . If they come , they won 't be able to get in and they 'll die out there . Someone has to stay behind . Someone has to let them in . Megan , Megan , no . I made a promise to the First Generation ... a promise that they would be protected . You need to make sure the children get into the Mountain Complex . You need to make sure they 're safe . I 'll meet you there . I can 't believe it . It 's Jason ! Oh . Oh , Jason . Pilcher planned for a flood like this . He left this ... everything we could ever need . Kate and I are gonna go check it out . I 'll call you on this . Don 't worry . We 'll be fine . We 're gonna have to do this in groups . We 're gonna send it back down as soon as we know it 's safe , all right ? Sleep tight . You ready ? Ready . - Shots fired . - Follow me ! - Shots fired , northeast wing . - Move up ! Wake her up . - What the hell do you think ... - I said wake her up . - Take that side . - Okay . - On your right ! - Hey . - Freeze ! - Down on the ground ! - Drop your weapons ! - Drop it . - On the floor ! - Drop it ! - Damn it . - Now . Don 't move . All right , Theresa . We 're good . Get everybody in the elevator . Come on . Let 's go . - Go ! Go ! - I 'll see you soon ! Ben , wait ! - Go ! Go ! Go ! - Wait ! - Stop ! - That 's it ! That 's it ! Wait for the next load . Okay . - Go ! - Be careful now . We go to go . - Let 's go . - There you go . Straight ahead , guys . We can 't wait ! We cannot wait ! Let 's go ! Where 's Theresa ? Where 's Ben ? Oh , I haven 't seen ' em yet . Ethan , they 're still down there . And the Abbies are inside . - Give me the bag . - Ethan ... Give me the bag . Ethan ... wait ! Just be careful . Find Pilcher . Make him turn on the power . Ben ! Let 's go ! _ Okay . How high are we going ? All the way to the top of the Mountain . You okay , sweetie ? What the hell was that ? Dad , they 're in the shaft . What ? Dad , we have to get out . Ben , Ben , take this . Huh ? What do you see up there ? There 's a ladder ! I see the door . - You ready ? - Uh-huh . You okay ? Yeah ? What 's taking them so long ? Promise me you two are gonna stay close , okay ? Okay . Let 's go . Dad , grab my hand . Come on . Go ahead . I 'm right behind you . No , Dad . Just come up , please . Ben , come on . We got to work as a team here . We got to keep those things from coming up . Dad ... Your mother , Amy , those people ... they 're counting on you , okay ? Just ... just go . I 'm right behind you . Now go ! Go ! Open the door ! Let 's go . Come on . All right . Come on . They 're going to get up the shaft , Ethan . And they 're gonna kill everyone . I warned you that revealing the truth would be the death of Wayward Pines . But you wouldn 't listen . The power to the fence . Turn it back on . No one else has to die , David . You can still do the right thing . I 've dedicated my entire life to those people . Who are you to come in here and tell me what 's right or wrong ? You 're only here because I chose you ... both of you . What neither of you ever understood is that this town is not about any one individual . It 's not about freedom . It 's about something much greater than that . It 's about the preservation of mankind . I have sacrificed everything to sow the seeds for its future , to protect it . Enlightenment is coming . My ideas will live on long after I 'm gone . No . Your ideas end here . Go ahead . Kill me . You can 't kill my ideas . They 're everywh ... I 'll try and get the power back on . Amy . Ben . Dad ? Dad ? Dad ! How 's Ben ? He 's ... still unconscious . I 'm looking for beds . People are tired . They need to sleep . Oh , there are beds in the east wing . And how about food , water ? Of course . I 'll get that organized . - Pam ? - Yeah . I want to help . And , uh , at the risk of sounding redundant , I 'm better with more information . Quite a sight , isn 't it ? What is all this ? The rest of the population , the ones who haven 't woken yet . Careful . I might take you seriously . I mean it , Kate . I 'm telling you the truth . You and I have never said one true thing to each other . Well , let 's start now , then , huh ? If we are going to survive , we 're gonna have to make it better . No more lies . No more surveillance . No more reckonings . If we work together , I believe it is possible . I believe we can succeed . We have to . This is it . This is all that 's left . This is the last of humanity . Mr. Burke ? Mr. Burke ? Where am I ? Wayward Pines , of course . Where is everyone ? Why are you dressed like that ? Uh , I 'm a nurse here now . Uh , I don 't understand . I graduated two months ago . I am more than qualified , Mr. Burke . Why are you calling me that ? Graduated ? How long was I unconscious ? Dr. Woodard will be in to see you shortly . You can ask him any questions you like , okay ? I 'm just gonna take your blood pressure . Amy ... how long ? Three years , four months . What ? Three years ? Ben , please . Please be quiet , okay ? They 're listening . After your accident , they put you back into suspension with the rest of the adults . I tried to get them to take you out earlier , but they wouldn 't allow it . They 're angry at your father . What ? They blame him for the Savior 's death . They think you 're like him . But I told them , I convinced them ... you 're not like him . You 're different . - Where are my clothes ? - Ben , Ben , wait , please . Where are my clothes ? Ben , they 're watching . And they will put you back into suspension with the adults . Amy , where are my clothes ? Ben ! Ben !

The position should pay attention after the storm intersection , Sun has set . Sometimes it happens when we passed Top of the Bermuda Triangle . Do not worry . Please expect sunset tomorrow . Puncak Bermuda Triangle ? Good news , right ? Whoever down again ? Yes , this phone also brings a wave . Oh my God , did you see ? Altitude us ? Flight speed ? Fuel ? Keep this much is not anything .

What are you writing ? I huh ? Just want to monitor everything . When she was my age , He must know everything because ... He never knows when his have a chance again . So I let him continue . Thank you . Strange . There is good news for me ? In this view . - None . - Not a blip . That Can function ? At first I thought so But we will also coordinate inaccurate . If this trouble , well it did not work . So we flew to die but not completely blind . There may be some air appear around us . Okay , then just see what have been found . None . Empty . According to the radar , we were completely alone in this . Perhaps the storm had stalled traffic . We will see how to contact revive . If not , why ? We are still a few hours from London . As if we were not captured in Or flight diversion . If we fly below the clouds , We can find a visual clue of the ship or can A relay messages of dialogue . I am sure it is the correct way ? If no one heard me on the ground , It 's just me moving . Cameron heard . Hicks , How to back ? We are a bit of a nuisance but okay . Good . I will issue a notification Crew and I want to return to a lower seat pitch . Everything okay ? Just try to stay away from some ... Gust above only . It 's normal procedure alone , okay ? Being . Everything okay ? We have to invite people to their seats . We will lower the height . He said to avoid turbulence . Public Nuisance ? Ladies and gentlemen , We want people to return to their seats . We are seeking to avoid interference We will fly below the clouds a bit . The only things that are mediocre But we hope everyone Please seatbelt just in case . Feedback has been done correctly all , Captain . Are you okay ? Yes , I 'm fine . Believe me , when you fly long enough like me What they look for . It 's not . OK . Land . Supposed to fly over the Atlantic rather . What to ... OK . So we flew astray . Ganderson , you hear ? Supervise constantly looking for air traffic tower , Lights flickered , each anything . Radar says that we have a smaller plane how 20km . But the whole is some old dish . I 'm sure it was your flight ? - Never seen anything like it before . - I 'm not sure what , But we are approaching it damn it . In front of the blind as well . Could another storm . It 's not a hurricane . Looks ... More fire . Oh God . Allah . Will ? There is a close second is fast approaching 9 o 'clock . Looks like a warrior . Damn , this is also a sign of our . Sit strengthened . What are the bright spots ? On what happened ? What is it ? We have fallen as some other aircraft in Ukraine is not ? Once the control head every I 'm sure he 'll tell us . I just wanted to ... find the answer alone . As soon as we know what happened , we 'll tell you . What ? No . No , we want answers . She left hand . Brother . If you do not sit down , we must hold . Now sit down ! OK . - Strong . - Will , is what 's wrong ? I 'm trying to figure out here . Rear still okay ? All fine . Only confusion and concern . Let me explain . We will inform you as soon as possible . Just keep everyone calm . See already empty . What approaching Not anymore . I want to keep a distance with the jet . A few minutes before we start the lower elevations again , okay ? What ? Will , before a difficult time we avoid them . We do not know where . There is no indication , we left everything Do mold beach and could not find them in the clouds . Ladies and gentlemen , your captain here . We flew deflected past because of the storm . But we 're out of danger . We ask you to remain calm . The crew will help you . I 'm sorry . Sorry . No , no problem . I help ? In fact , we hope to help get him . Sorry guys . Now I do not have time . It must wait . Captain , Cameron here . Font color = " FFCC33 " FC font color = " FFCC33 " INE.N font color = " FFCC33 " ET - It 's time to talk later . - Captain , my name is Bennett . - This is my colleague , Dale . - You do not get into the cockpit . Hicks , take them out of here . Captain , do you know when a plane before not ? - I want you both on the spot . - But that plane Is a Junkers Ju 88 , fighters . - I have said very clearly . - No more making the plane Since 1945 already . You have heard us say . Impossible air as they are used . It looks like he was flying without landing , Captain . You lost your contacts ? No , of course . We ... system downtime own . We flew that most of us do not have . Everything works via satellite . Radar is the only thing that works . Fully signal loss . Almost no satellite . Do you have 30 seconds . I 'm sure the phone work ? - We jammed ... - But he did not contact anyone Since the ice storm . Type . That 's because there is little phone tower on the western front . In 1940 Just calm down . Try to sleep . Now I can not sleep . Nor father . Strange . Based on the beach , plane , We believe we just flew through the bombing Saint-Nazaire . Month 6 / 1940 , Nazi bombing of the western coast of France . I do not have time for this . Take them to their seats away . Wait , we can help him find a place we are in . If you fly under the cloud , we know little about the land terrain ... Okay , okay . You can help . But let us return to the site immediately . Of course , Captain . And our elevation . You 'll easily catch the wave frequency is weak ... I do not want to hear anything about time travel second , okay ? Find out now where we have . Although it may seem old-fashioned view , that the radar Advanced more than what Germany took today . Enough . Now go back to your seat . The problem is a radar that will help you go ahead conventions - If we catch another plane ... - If you 're right , But if it is a giant letter , I see our proposal back in any way ? We will find unusual weather phenomena . If one of these things dragged us here , Something like that would be able to bring us back . So once again we find the storm ? Yes . - Will you put them in a place to go . - To the right . This one . Everyone . Do not reveal the words ... to anyone . Alright ? Being . You guys , please . We are having electrical problems . As many planes ? And the bombs ? I just do not want anyone to panic . We 'll handle it . We will overcome this . I flew with him a million times . He never disappointed me once . We will continue to communicate with the central but you need not worry . Thank you for your cooperation and patience . I do not think we can make that jump . It was just assuming it . And when in fact the authentic physical ? Do not . I 'm not sure which . - I help him ? - Captain say ? You 've heard him say we will fly low in to support the situation . OK . On what ? I assure you , you know everything that everyone else knows . Now let go . Thank you . I promise , if he touched me again , I will have many problems to solve a completely different . Okay , if we detect any mold public beaches . It would be complicated there . There pollution for decades ... Are you sure Saint-Nazaire true ? It is a unique beach bombing in 1940 . OK . Okay . History Books , pencils . - Top route only . - For . Keep an eye on the storm . Do not be too tempting . Hurricane is really a crazy time travel . I know , no sense at all . I 'm trying to figure out what to do accordingly . So now let 's focus on that . Emergency . This is the best 42 . IA Transmission is open to anyone . We flew into Heathrow was deflected . Ask for help . Reminders . This is the best 42 . IA Emergency . Is anybody out there ? End . As we radar empty within a few miles . Try to determine whether Where the hell we are . Hey , there . A river , huh ? Can . Only the outline of his views . It was absolutely incredible . Now under us , invasion Slope determined . If this is true in June , Hitler was on his way sets of forces . In a week from now , he would come to Paris . There must have been lights are used ? City reasonable ? Perhaps there is a power failure . To see someone not hear . Reminders . It Flight 42 , if anyone heard me , Please confirm . It looks like the French . If so , then it is true that we are in France . Wait , wait . Germany there ? ... Out . A Lot ? I 'm Captain William Strong . IA Flight 42 , you hear ? Brother was in international airspace . Please confirm your identity . I 'm Captain William Strong . Request support . Did you hear ? Captain ? Listen . Whatever it is , this is only used local channels chemical emergency . This is the best 42 to leave Dallas . We are just now flying blind . We thought we just saw ... Some German bombers . Aircraft bombed ? - Aircraft him , huh ? - Yes . A Lot ? My name is Sergeant Nigel Sheffield . This is confidential information , but I ordered blocks long distance transmission . The he could not air . Listen . I do not have time Where winding . Please connect us with the air traffic tower . We need them right away . Save tower Air Traffic ? This is a war zone where . Anyone who can help us . Anyone . Okay , Captain . English in the same military unit ? We are a commercial aircraft . International . And he flew over the area bombing of Germany ? No , that 's a myth . Listen . English please help us with . What is your PM ? Okay , Captain . On 17 / 06 , 21 : 30 . What year ? English kidding ? Let 's talk know each other , all right , Nigel ? 06 / 17 / 1940 . Commercial aircraft there is no timetable , huh ? If the scam is complete , I suggest that you turn off these channels . Listen ! I do not know whether he was attending on deceit , But we were in danger . He is the only person we call . Scam ? Of course , not then . Now please leave this frequency and ... How do I convince him that we civil aircraft in danger , huh ? I do not know , Captain . Here . This is it . It is there . If Rennes then ... So that means ... We have to report to the Captain . Come on . Is this a hoax , Nigel , or who she goes , Everything we have is some detectors altitude And radar . Currently we only have this much . Radar from him ? You know , the phone detector ? Airspace Scan , tell aircraft and other objects where . It sounds very similar technologies are RDF British military grows , But I do not use that stuff . Now the only thing that helps us fly overhead . Captain , we think we know where we are the time . Nigel , professor of history few come to me . They think ... I know we are . I 'm sorry , what ? We are facing the river were very identified and the surrounding hills . We just flew over Rennes in northwest France by Time bombing . Estimated to the best standards . We are confident that he flew through the bombing of Saint-Nazaire RMS Lancastria which attacked and sunk . Sink it ? The Landcastria ? If that is true , how do you ... He will find it hard to believe , But we came from DC , United States The 21st century and we flew through the storm Or something and now we are here . - This truth ... - forget it ! This is what we know . We stayed in this alone . And being in a war zone . Nigel , we could die if not he help . If we could let him know bombing of Saint-Nazaire , why ? What did he say ? Air Force . Junkers Ju 88 , Heinkel He 111 , Messerschmitt Bf 110 , a new form . And Landcastria . Contact them away . Perhaps they will verify that it has sunk . Well , I 'll do it . If you 're serious , Back to this frequency of 30 minutes . We can not wait 30 minutes . Call back in 5 minutes . I will do what is possible . Christ himself . Show directions . What is his invention . We 're back on track , right ? I hope so . Then we 'll find a wide range . Out of half a tank of gas and then . Sheffield . Colonel , welcome moment . Talk away . One of the most urgent tasks . She would not believe . Strengthening and Consolidation Allied armed : 07 / 06 - 15 / 06 . D Day Normandy . Ladies and gentlemen , I have information that this crew has failed to provide ... - Brother , please ... - Take your hands off me . I know this sounds a myth , But I believe somehow We travel time . How many cups you drink it ? We have all seen the storm . Aircraft , bombs . He knows . Somehow , we have to travel back through time in World War 2 - Everyone please remain calm . - There is no ! No ! No one told us what we deserve to know . Sit down . He makes people afraid of it . You do not believe that we travel Time but obviously we are in a war zone . So what ? So what ? We will not survive . The aircraft is not built to combat . Listen , listen . You know this is okay ? Now While we are talking , we flew over France In May 06 / 1940 . On the ground , gather Hitler troops And we , all of us , We have a chance To change human history . We could kill Hitler . Okay , and ... He proposed us how ? They tried to kill Hitler during the war and failed . During the war , their activities through intelligence data . We 'll know exactly where Hitler . All that is written in this book . Everything is step by step , detailed . Credentials where Hitler and SS troops leave . They will see me approaching from miles away . That 's suicide . Where Failed . We are bomber and Airplane Attack siege . We will not survive it . But we can best meet , we can find him and kill Hitler . Okay , enough of that . Hey , down . He was right . We have to handle things on their own . We can prevent genocide . We just need to find a safe answer . Please convince pilots . - Another UK . - Stop . Back . I think he will follow our camp . We can win this fight . Or you just tell it . I just knew he was going to hijack the plane . And it is an act of terrorism . I am a patriot . We can follow how easy or difficult . But there was no way for him to rob us plane . You think you stopping us ? I do not think we want to know . Use of this aircraft , Sergeant , You could be a hero . I want no quarrel about this , then more . Font color = " FFCC33 " FC font color = " FFCC33 " INE.N font color = " FFCC33 " ET English ! What is it ? You think not informed beforehand . New England did not tell his thoughts . Considered as we try . It 's easy to make mistakes , even though he knew exactly enemy . Trust . Considered the lesser was actually World War 2 takes place . And we the slightest mistake , the slightest severance , The existence of this plane , Technologies and book Will let Hitler know everything . Later Nazi flag flying on the roof of the White House will All because he wants to be a hero . Maybe we can change the past , But we can also destroy it . Forever . Now back seat and shut up . - Yes . - The man behind the fine ? Well , nothing that can not be handled . We can tie them back . For those of refuse . That 's right is not it ? Yes , he was the officer . We will prevent them from intimidating him . Thank you . Self thank yourself . Fighting trip with his fire extinguisher . With the current pace , we have about 114 minutes fly again . That does not count pitch up or down . At least we know where he 'll go . I know where he is going , right ? We really are in the middle of France . If maintained route , we can Find allies Or a safe place immediately met , right ? What is it ? One stupid to rob the air because he wanted to kill Hitler . Some soldiers on board the situation is controlled , But passengers will need to answer . And soon . Sgt Nigel Sheffield called Captain William Strong . I am a strong captain . Say , Nigel . So he 's still there . I 'm afraid we 're still here . When it came through 10 minutes and then , Nigel . Yes . There are things that take time much , Captain . I have to talk to the commander . Corps on the Western Front again and ... We believe him somewhat . Not for time travel . News brilliance at Lancastria seems appropriate . And the truth is ... I know very boring listening ear But we land foreign enemy fire , And Germany is not easy to give up in the battle anywhere . I 'm glad we understand each other in material , Nigel . Well ... Now you have more information although more or less okay . After Dunkirk . Sorry about that . What a bloody battle . Blood War ? No , no . Allies had evacuated 400,000 legion . They evacuated ... But we have read the report . They were attacked from both sides . A bloody massacre . Nearly half a million people lost their lives . Terrible . What ? Dunkirk He said it was a massacre . It does not happen like that . Dunkirk evacuation was successful Allied . They saved 400,000 legion . If you 're right , Past Do not pass us . Sorry about that , Nigel . Captain , I think the question is , Can I help you ? Now we need two things , A safe route , And a safe landing . By the way , any information you have about The storm is not unusual in the region . I will do what is possible , Captain . Where are you ? We are near Voiron . Is almost impossible . Right across Rennes recently . Do into a straight line . So you 're near the German border . Flight speed now is how much ? 400 miles . I hate to say this , Captain , but the first I have to do is change the direction . We have intervened in the German phone frequencies , And it refers to the large aircraft in France . So anyone doing this bombing Know me here . There is no aerial ally , anyone help us keep it ? I need to know exactly where brothers . We may have become clearer . How do I mean ? We flew without lights outside . But we can turn on the lights and run landing runway . Are you sure about that ? Most of our systems have been damaged already . Analog They use it , right ? Then that 's it . Take this to the Colonel now . Nigel ? Something straight towards us . Wait , Captain . Do Allies . We will face them in 30 seconds . Towards quickly . Captain . Have not seen any move , the crew inside us . You , go to their seats immediately . Do not say anything to anyone . Tell everyone seatbelts . - Will , I ... - Right . While listening to the German operations enabled him . All secure , Captain . Aircraft fucking Nazi hordes . Aircraft Luftwaffe star ? They should not have . Replace them . Say , Daniel . Do pulled back . - We are still pursuing . - I know . Captain . Will he still out there ? Not now , Nigel . We are being shot . Flight 42 , did you hear ? Damn ! - Are you planning to use ? - Yes . General category . Do not panic . What ? Why ? 3,000 sets . 2,000 sets . Nearly 1,000 later . - Go ! - The height is too low . - Lift ! - Up ! Two planes ... Right behind us . Daniel ! Continue . With the help to the cockpit immediately . Daniel hit too . Come on , buddy . Here I am . No , do not ! Come on , buddy . Continue . Let me see it at all . - See where rather heavy . - Are you sure ? Often will have stitches but not now . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , dying sick , But I 'll be fine . Aircraft do ? Perhaps even worse . Text much energy hydroplane . You can not add the cost of fuel . Height above 15,000 should be kept alone . - Bad star ? - Sure hell . Of course it would have in it . Nigel . We got trouble , my friend . Nigel ! - Telephone Conversation shot again ? - No , just jammed it . We surpassed later . Hope so . So ... we hid in the cloud for safe keeping talking to Nigel and later shot ? Now we could not land in low gear . Perfect . Captain . Give me a little . Will , if passengers know , may have helped . We need to work together now . We all . Daniel , you fly it ? Yes , I think so . Be . I 'll need someone to help , just in case . Stay with him . - Sitting in my chair . - Are you sure ? I 'm sure . Cameron , let 's go . UK immediately seated . Hiding us huh ? We need to know if I should die this . - You have to be quiet . - You still have not said anything . - It will ... - UK . We want to keep him quiet And sit down , okay ? Ladies and gentlemen , I am the captain position , William stronger . And it 's time I told the truth then . We moved back , the commander ? He did not . He should rest here . Do you believe we have anything ? Not much . We are talking they have to dodge bullets enemy aircraft . Then I lost contact . I 'm afraid ... I 'll keep trying , commander . If you relate , I I get information about the radar there . Player , commander . I will do what is possible . If you really have a super-plane , Would rather destroy it than let it fall into the hands of the Axis . Selection We can not separate themselves fall from the sky . I want to apologize to hide position for so long . We 've run into something I thought was unusual weather but more than that . Some of us even believe Deputy Daniel We have gone back in time . With the help of two people , Well as my contacts on the ground , we decided that I am in France . These people believe that now Do 1940 There is a way . Nonetheless , We are in a war zone . And both are in jeopardy . If we hide in the clouds , I will be safe . The most important thing for you can do , all of you , Do quiet . All we can do is fly and find a safe place to land . The have agreed not ? That landed . The other aircraft fired at us and ruin our lander . It will not open . And we are looking to improve . But I can not do it alone . Is there anyone Help me ? Who is willing to below And help ? Captain . I am an engineer . - We use a hydraulic motor , huh ? - Yes . I 'll go with you . Thank you . Theresa . A helpful , Theresa . Who else does not ? It is also not there . I can help . I 'm very clever , because he says it . - Thanks , I ... - Hector . Majamon Hector . Very happy to have him , Hector . Thank you . - It is a pleasure , Captain . - Very impressed . We will decline . The crew will be on duty . Daniel will make us fly again . If there is a problem he will contact me . We do not hide anything with you again . Now we focus on keeping people safe . Theresa . Hector . My opinion . Is I know time travel is not possible , right ? Of course I know . Everything is possible . If you have faith . Do not stabbed . That 's good . Captain , look at this . Perhaps ... we can connect braided . More than anything , I like it , Hector . Hey , it 'll be fine . Lui again . Lui again ! Daniel . We have just opened the hatch . Try lowering the landing gear away . Player . No , Will . Captain , look . I see . We have to take it off . Daniel . Thu gear and then lower again see . No ? No , Daniel . It has not folded . I 'll have to go down there . I 'm going to cut it . It 's crazy . No , we know what to do ? Daniel . We had to go down to cut travel site entangled . Low altitude drops in 1500 . Captain , please . How to fix it . I can not let him help . Pilot England . People need you . Please do . I will try . Please . He tried . No , Will ? Hector . Sticking to make . Sticking to create , Hector . - Do not ! - Clinging to make , Hector . Merry-go guy on wheels . Come on , Hector , I can do that . - Hector ! - Come on , Hector ! Thu undercarriage back soon ! Come on , Hector ! Okay there . Come on , Hector . Will , everything is fine ? We glitches . Wait there . We 're here . Landing gear fixed . Thanks to the two heroes here . The story did ? For these countries fly now that we are wasting a lot of fuel . And about 90 minutes to fly again , approx . But our position ? Course near the border between France and Switzerland . Do well , Briana . I 'll take over . We have contact with Nigel , say do not have much time . We have to fly below the clouds . Today I 've been shot once before . Font color = " FFCC33 " FC font color = " FFCC33 " INE.N font color = " FFCC33 " ET Ladies and gentlemen , We have to lower altitudes to catch radio communications . Nigel , answer it . Can you hear me ? Captain Strong , Nigel , it was good to hear his voice . Lord . As he suddenly interrupted contact , I had feared the worst situation . But why interrupt I touch it ? We have to dodge bullets and fly at clouds but at least now we know Radio link from our resumed . The position you 're in ? We are close to the Swiss border . We are just 80 minutes flying time over and it is no more To overcome everything . As I mentioned earlier ... Unusual weather phenomena ? True . Before we went to the wrong place , We have started a hurricane center with light I have never seen . A black cloud and green energy center at its . Yes . I 'll investigate . Now is the most pressing issues proximity of its German airspace . I suggest that you keep the direction of flight . I am looking for potential landing sites . And my commander insisted I had to ask for more information on the of the radar . You want to know something , Nigel ? Whatever one might say . Captain , may I ? Hello , my name is Bennett . Radar , located in the nose of the aircraft and emit radio waves To identify objects in the area . In the cockpit there is such a center console bull And scan the area looking for signals and blip on the screen Shows our location . There 's all . This may sound too simple . Listen very useful there . Until now , we keep network thank you , Nigel . I think the Americans have to fight sooner rather than later To help us at the forefront of technology . As I say , Nigel , we have done if possible . William , one more thing you should know . - My commanding officer ... - Damn ! We had back then , Nigel . We were attacked then , Nigel . Keep yourself safe . Will , the bullet coming . Where are we ? One rear and one in the front . Playing alone . - Fast ! - Wait a minute . Wait . Wait a minute . Wait . Up ! Behind everyone What ? Passengers , Crew ? Some people vomiting and shivering but we 're fine . Thank you . - What are the other options ? - We 're trapped . Radar showed a brief alert . So my opportunity to speak to Nigel is also very low . That 's because on our radar term . We signal , and detect signals around us ? True . What if we have a ground-based radar ? What can we use to help track enemy aircraft ? That may be useful there . So ... let 's give it to Nigel . Said Nigel unreasonable . At this point , they should have the radar then . How does he speak as he slowed for a few years . Perhaps this is why we are here . Not to kill Hitler , but maybe radar brought to England . We could cut from the nose of the aircraft . Drop drop it in a united front . They can attach to the center and become our air traffic controllers . How historical change , why ? As far as we know , History has changed . They lost the Battle of Dunkirk . Who knows where there is no difference anymore ? It can take them and we about the history that we remember . Maybe ... this can fix everything . Will . Maybe you do not believe in time travel , But he said that , Options we 've all been . Call Nigel tells him that next early Christmas present . Alas , a rocket ! We lost altitude there . Restart away . Again . Everyone was calm . We will take a high degree of . Nigel , answer it . - Answer me , Nigel . - Will ! Thank you God . - I always think to lose him now . - We 're still here , mate . We almost blew to pieces by a missile . Rockets huh ? From the plane back ? No , I think it is a ground-to-air . - Will , I must tell you ... - Nigel , listen here . We are the Swiss border 100 miles . We wanted to give him a gift . Our Radar . - I did not find a decrease in point ? - Captain . Are you sure you want to do that ? This is the only way of To find a vacant direction and air self-defense . The he should be somewhere near Metz , right ? True . The Berlin he will cross in 10 minutes . Yes . If you drop down radar , they will not have the opportunity to intervene . We will . So I will report to superiors . 10 minutes if there is enough fuel in the region Germany . Where Not to be missed . We will send it to him . Good luck , my friend . Past and interruptions . Listen to and know . 10 minutes . Bennett , he and Daniel bottom cavity . Hector and Theresa Bring follow . Cut the box out of the nose of the aircraft . Fasten seat belt . Dale , we must give ride was very quiet . Let 's create something that can help secure after being dropped from several thousand feet . - Sheffield . - You must listen to me . We can not continue to fight them again . We must help them to safety . Nigel , we talk about going happen ... They want to do their radar . Drop down to us . The only way to get it is that we must stop attacking him . - Commissioned Officers , called the plane back home soon . - Obviously , the commander . I need a bag . Anything can be used as if it . How can I help him ? I found something can be used as if it . I think I can help . I take this stuff at the airport . - I also lived in London others . - Thank you very much . Do you have bags yet ? Columns in zipper offline . Daniel 's . How do I turn it on ? I need a USB battery . Does anyone have it ? - I have a lump . - I have a lump . Bennett , one at an altitude of 10,000 sets . Drop off . It , Captain . One , two , three . Captain , released before delivery . Reminder , released before delivery . - Nigel , and the packet is sent . - Is it true ? We would recommend going to get it . I will begin to increase height . Rushing up . We hear a lot of hours talking . They can carry around quickly . Nigel , do not have much time . Parcel How are you ? It would come here a minute . Wait there . Do we have before shipment . It is about . Do with him , huh ? What a strange way to drop and receiver . Nigel , he is our guardian angel . Be careful ! She felt it . We have radar then . Well done , Nigel . Now working in a hurry , we have you in this regard . Nigel . We 're almost out of petrol later . We need not only to the present ! Kia . Scanning the sky .

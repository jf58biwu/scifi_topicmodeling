 and proclaim that I shall create a new kingdom here in Earthspace . this war is giving every indication that it will become protracted . what should our course of action be ? Is this a time for Orbital Knights to squabble among themselves ? Is it a time to squabble over credit ? The time has come for us to gather under one flag and fight together for the future of Vers . Count Troyard . This includes the right to decide upon whom to bestow the power to awaken Aldnoah . it is my heartfelt wish that you think of Count Troyard 's words as my own and rally to his side . we do for Vers ! I see . Her Highness 's words must have sounded like a divine revelation . Divine revelation ? Everyone knows that she was only able to issue that proclamation because of you . To the knights who are unhappy about the present they were words from on high . Surely they must feel that someone has appeared who will lead them . You exaggerate . rebel factions are also certain to appear . There is something that I wish you to do on that score . Milord ? we will never see the end of it . Start by rooting out the dangerous elements . We can let the proper authorities take it from there . Milord ? Princess Asseylum 's name will be motivation enough . And it should be simple enough to strip them of their knighthood with some random accusation or other . You do not approve ? You think it too underhanded ? Milord . Quite the opposite . It is only natural that you would stop at nothing to achieve your goal . I ... you have seemed prepared for the worst . My wish was to be close to Her Highness . My wish was to be worthy of her . And to be of some service to her ... But I ... then that is ... Harklight ? Enter . M-Milord Slaine ... Miss Eddelrittuo ? We are quite satisfied with your ship 's current actions . we want you to continue providing unit support as a commando squad . I have no objections to that . But about that proclamation by Princess Asseylum ... That nonsense about founding a new dynasty in Earthspace ? It 's nothing but big talk meant to stir up the Mars Knights . Something along those lines . That might be the case . But perhaps we should consider the possibility that the enemy 's attacks might be about to move to the next level . doing nothing ? Is that what you are implying ? sir . I meant nothing of the sort . we are currently coordinating with our primary units . you will be contacted . but there is no telling how much faith we can put in a ship that runs on the enemy 's power . but that 's just how it is . I 'm amazed that you sat through that without any outbursts . I 'm only here as your escort . I 'm not that naive . They just don 't understand . They probably just don 't know what they 've got . They 're doing the best they can . No . I 'm not griping about how they 're treating the Deucalion . I 've just ... given up on them . On us ? On the Martians . and they 're wildly misinterpreting it . That 's terrifying . I will drain the therapeutic fluid and bring Princess Asselyum to my castle . Tell no one of this . of course . - But why not - . - Do as I say ! Forgive me . I did not mean to startle you . No visitors are allowed ? My sister 's condition is that serious ? She ... Perhaps it was a miracle that she held on for this long . How much time does she have ? Today ? Tomorrow ? They say that they still do not know . It is just as possible that she will remain in this condition indefinitely . I see ... I can guess what you are feeling . but she is your only sibling by blood . Slaine ? I must go . Slaine ... Slaine . Even if you cry in front of me today . Even if you shed tears over her . Because I ... am already yours . Could that have triggered it ? No ... It couldn 't be . I always looked up to you . You had everything that I did not . So I hated you . sister . I will be truly be your substitute and I will be Slaine 's support ! Why ... ? What 's up with that ? Does that mean she got ditched here ? The captain left me in charge because she trusts me . but Cdr . Mizusaki has got to be devastated . Why did she pick Lt. Marito of all people as her traveling companion ? more like . What 's this about Lt. Marito ? so I thought it might be serious . the situation is definitely changing . I can 't believe that the princess is getting married ... That 's what you 're interested in ? but look ... Isn 't it possible that her change of heart was because someone around her felt that way ? she was seduced by him or something ? Sorry . But we 're still not 100 % sure that the Princess Asseylum who said that right ? I honestly can 't say . but there 's no telling just how much he can see . Have you eaten ? In a bit . Let me find a good place to leave off . You 've been this way since we were little . everything else fades away . Here . Yuki . uh ... Yeah . That proclamation seemed to prove everything you 've been saying . and if would she think of a founding a kingdom in Earthspace ? Slaine Troyard . That douchebag who shot my dear little brother ? Yuki . It doesn 't matter if she 's real or not anymore . I don 't think anyone would bother to listen to her . Even if she tried to broker a peace between Earth and Mars again . I will get preparations underway . Milord Slaine ? I 'm listening . Proceed as planned . Milord . Her Highness has yet to - . She will wake up soon . I know it . Milord . But ... tragedies do happen . Milord ? It 's nothing . Has there been any change ? No . They believe that she might remain in this condition for some time . We will wait as long as it takes . We are used to waiting . waking up to find that everything has changed . Will I ... Will I seem different to her as well ? I 'm sure of it . I shall return . Milord Slaine ! Rittuo ... Eddelrittuo ... Milady ... I ... She ... She is awake ... Your Highness ! It is me ! It is Slaine ! Slaine Troyard ! I am Slaine Troyard ... Your Highness ... Slaine ... Slaine ... Slaine ... Slaine ... Slaine ... Slaine ... Your Highness ! I 've been waiting so long to hear you say my name once again ! Count Mazuurek . Count Barouhcruz . what are your plans ? as well . I can act as intermediary . I have heard what happened with Count Marylcian . It must have been most galling . and that was the result . There is nothing to hold a grudge over . Troyard is dangerous . there are even suspicions that he also killed Count Saazbaum - . It doesn 't matter who it is . I merely ... But you - . Hold your tongue . How could you let yourself be misled by such unfounded rumors ? I take it ? No one can stop Count Troyard 's rise . even Aldnoah activation privileges . Do not try to fight an Olympian sandstorm . " I suggest you choose wisely . Count Barouhcruz pledges his full and unconditional cooperation . but they appear to be amenable to acknowledging the new kingdom . Morale is also on the increase within the base . We have almost finished going through the list of knights who seem likely to oppose you . We are ready to take forceful steps at any time . Milord Slaine ? Is something the matter ? but is it about Princess Asseylum 's recovery ? You want me to give her time off ? Eddelrittuo ? Yes . If only a little while . I 'm sure that Princess Asseylum 's sudden turn came as a blow to her . Slaine ? I 've been worried . Thank you for your concern . You are the only person that I can count on now . I will make Vers mine . For Her Highness . Dales Platoon and Orlov Platoon currently marching towards enemy Landing Castle . go on the offensive immediately and destroy it . They 're lovely . Milady . he did ? It looks just like Earth . It does . Are your memories of Earth returning ? Birds ... I was watching birds ... with that boy . Milady ? Kaizuka ... ? Is something the matter ? too ? This is Dales Platoon . Currently closing on enemy Landing Castle with Orlov Platoon . Clydesdale Platoon ? Powerful explosive charges are attached to the arrowheads ! Be careful ! Bastard ! Don 't waste your ammunition ! The enemy is cloaked and is fast ! which is probably to ... muzzle flashes would make it easy to pinpoint its location . This must be to avoid that . Optical camouflage ? Does invisibility technology even ... ? It must be based on ... it 's ingenious . and it 's not casting a shadow . But ... It definitely exists . Yeah . Milord ? Customize it however you like . I 've already discussed the matters of your peerage title and activation factor with Princess Lemrina . Milord Slaine ... The arrow has been loosed . There is no turning back now . Milord ! Count Sebring . Count Raffia . Inform Count Orga . Tell him to swear fealty . loading complete . too . Fire ! it definitely exists . And if it exists ... it will have an effect on air currents ! Target located . Right ! Open fire ! - Lieutenant ! - What is it ? At our 3 o 'clock ! New enemy ! New enemy closing in from dead ahead ! They 're attacking as a team ? too ! Incoming ! A Landing Castle ... brace for impact ! Multiple Landing Castles ... Multiple Kataphraktoi ... Simultaneously ! He 's made his move ! It 's him ! Right . It 's too late for doubts now . There is no returning from this place I have come to .

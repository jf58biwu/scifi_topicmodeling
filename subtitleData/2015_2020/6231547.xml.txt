 [ narrator ] previously on dark matter . [ one ] we all woke up just like you , No idea who we are or how we got here . We 've named ourselves by the order we woke up in . I 'm one . Two . Three . Four . Five . Which makes you , six . [ android ] murder , assault , arson , theft , . Turns out the raza aren 't a rac . The raza is the name of this sh . We 're not here to help these pe , we 're here to kill them . We had a deal . I got a better offer . [ android ] good morning everyone . Here is your report from the br . I hope you 're all enjoying a hearty breakfast . The ship 's engines are operating within acceptable parameters . At current rate of travel we should be arriving At the space station in approximately 26 hours and 7 se . Exactly one hour earlier than the last time She updated us , one hour ago . Thank you robot . [ three ] so , here 's what happens when we hit the space station . Hawk the ship , split the profits , Have a fond farewell toast- - bid each other adieu . No ? [ one ] you want to split up ? Yeah , we 're six strangers and a robot . We don 't owe each other anything . But we 're a team . No offense , but this " team " Has a lot of dead weight on it . [ six ] offense taken . Once we get to the station we 're gonna refuel , resupply , . I 'd be happy to give anyone who wants to leave their share Of whatever we have left , but we 're not selling the ship . [ door whooshes open and closed ] Ain 't up to her . I don 't want to sell the ship . Me neither . Me neither . Okay , yeah . Alright . [ door whooshes open and closed ] You know , if we just stick together- - [ four slams silverware down ] Fine . That 's fine . [ door whooshes open and closed ] This is what i wanted anyway . A little peace and quiet . [ silence ] [ keyboard keys pressing down ] You wanna play a game or something ? [ six sighs ] nah , i 'm just gonna take a nap . No thanks , kiddo . I found this antique book in one of the holding rooms . It says it 's a classic , so i 'm sure i 've read it before , But it 's all new to me now . I can give it to you when i 'm done if you wa- - Or not . Hey ! [ door slams shut ] [ five sighs ] [ hatchdoor squeaks opens ] ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ five panting ] [ flashlight clicks on ] [ five panting ] [ hatchdoor slams shut ] ¶ suspenseful music continues ¶ [ five panting ] [ hatchdoor creaks open ] [ loud bang ] [ started gasp ] ¶ music playing ¶ [ electronic buzzing ] [ android ] male , appears to be in his mid-teens . Didn 't need to break out the fancy scanners to tell us t . How long has he been dead ? A while . [ once ] shouldn 't he have started to decompose by now ? Under normal circumstances yes , but the temperature In that section of the ship was significantly lowered . As a result , the body was quite well preserved . What were you doing up in those vents anyways ? [ five stuttering ] exploring . You shouldn 't be up there at all . It 's dangerous . Not anymore dangerous than the rest of this ship . Any idea what happened to him ? He was shot . A single bullet to the kidney . He bled to death . Who was he , why the hell did he bleed out on our ship ? That the scanner can 't tell us . Is there any record of another crew member In the ship 's computer ? None that i found . You mean one of us killed him And stuffed him in that utility room ? There 's no point in speculating . Without our memories , we 'll probably never know . Check the body for valuables . We 'll jettison it the next time we drop out of ftl . That 's it ? What ? Did you want to organize a funeral ? Prepare parting remarks ? I think it 'd be a bad idea to dock at the space station With a dead body on board . One of us killed him , that doesn 't bother you ? Almost everything about this bothers me , But pointing fingers isn 't going to get us anywhere . Let 's just- - Lets just forget about this and put it behind us , alright ? Come on . ¶ door slides open ¶ ¶ door slides closed ¶ I need you to do something for me . Of course , two . And i 'm going need you to keep quiet about it . [ staff whirling through air ] [ three ] hey , you busy ? Listen , i need you to help swing the vote . Get the others to sell the ship so we can all cash out . What makes you think i wanna do that ? Well because selling this ship allows us the freedom To chart our own course- - Woah ! Call our own shots . [ three ] come on man , instead of letting these losers decide for , Let 's cut ' em loose ! [ four ] it 's too soon . What are you talking about ? We don 't know enough about who we are , who they are . The person i was chose to be on this ship . He must have had a reason . You don 't know that you even chose to be on this ship . The clearest path hasn 't presented itself yet . And until it does , i stay . Alright , have a good time playing with your stick . But if the day should come where i 'm no longer pleased With this arrangement- - Yeah ? Even then i wouldn 't sell the s , I 'd take it for myself . I feel bad for him . The time for feeling bad for him is long past . He 's gone . I know , it 's just ... The thought of dying in some dark room , Bleeding and alone . He was around my age . I probably knew him . Maybe . And maybe not . When i was in that vent , i could 've just passed right by , But something told me to stop and look in that room . It was like i 'd been there befo , Like i knew there was something to find . [ frustrated sigh ] I knew he was there , which means i knew him . He probably meant something to me once . And now , he 's just some dead stranger . It 's not right . I just wish i could remember . Well , the more i think about it , The more i believe we 're betterf not remembering any of it . Really ? Yeah . Fresh starts for all of us , right ? What if- - Yeah ? What if some of our memories were- - What if they weren 't all gone ? [ five ] don 't ! Please ! [ six ] she has all our memories in her head ? ! And you knew it ? ! I knew that 's what she thought . And you told her to stay quiet about it ? Why ? I wanted to make sure . Yeah ? How 'd you plan on doing that ? She 's been having dreams . Dreams she thinks might be memories , Except they 're not just hers . What ? I think all of our memories may have somehow Been transferred into her subconscious . How 's that even possible ? [ six ] how 's any of this possible ? [ two ] there 's something else . One of the dreams she experienced was of one of us Sabotaging the stasis pods . Son of a bitch . [ one ] hang on . Just because she dreamed it , doesn 't make it real . I had the android search through all terminal activity Prior to our last deep sleep . And ? ! I recovered portions of a self-deleted subroutine That was initiated prior to all of you entering stasis . Although it 's specific intent i , It would appear your memories were targeted . Oh , come on guys . How hard can this be ? The kid remembers doing it . She did it ! [ six ] if it was her , why would she tell us about it ? Think about it . [ two ] alright , alright , come on . Why didn 't you tell us about this sooner ? I wanted to see if her dream about tampering With the ship 's systems checked out . It did , which means this goes far beyond that one memory . She could have all of our memories Tucked away in her head . When you dream , You have no idea whose memories you 're experiencing ? No . In the dreams , everything is happening to me , But sometimes i can tell i 'm not me . It 's really confusing , and a lot of times kinda hazy . I have trouble remembering it when i wake up . So someone in this room wiped our memories And probably killed that kid . [ power system failing ] [ buzzing ] [ alarm beeping ] [ two ] what was that ? We just dropped out of ftl . Why ? There 's something wrong with the ship . [ alarm continues ] [ android ] we 've lost power to several systems , Including external sensors and the ftl drive . What happened ? The operation efficiency of one of the outer relays Dropped below minimum safe . The ship detached the coupling and shut down All related systems to avoid a catastrophic failure . Translation please ? We nearly blew a fuse . Except in this case , " blowing a fuse " Would equate to an explosion powerful enough To vaporize the entire ship . Well , that 's great . Dead bodies , hacked stasis pods , now this . It 's a whole lotta things going wrong on this ship . Almost like someone 's been tampering with it , Isn 't that right tech monkey ? Back off . Why are you protecting her ? You don 't know her . I know i like her a lot more than i like you . Could this be sabotage ? [ android ] the coupling is located on the outer hull . If someone wanted to tamper with it , They would have had to perform an eva . You mean go outside the ship ? It seems unlikely . [ two ] no , it 's impossible . We were in ftl until five minutes ago . Exactly . On the other hand , tampering with the diagnostic system To make the ship think that the coupling would fail Would be comparatively simple . If someone wanted to disable the ship Without doing any real damage , this would be an excellent way . Well , we can 't stay out here forever . How do we get the ftl back online ? First , i have to determine what , if anything , Is wrong with the system . That could take some time . We 'll let you get to it then . Do you have another question ? Yeah . When people lie , they exhibit tells , right ? Physical signs that they 're being untruthful . When humans are being deceptive , They show a spike in respiration , blood pressure , And changes in skin conductivity . Now those signs , we wouldn 't necessarily be able To notice them , but you could , right ? If i was in close enough proximity , yes . In theory , i could determine if a person was lying . [ four ] where are we going ? [ three ] you 'll see . [ four ] you said you wanted to show me something . [ three ] i do . Just trust me on this one . You are going to be amazed . That 's it ? Yeah . You expect me to be amazed by a very large door ? No , not the door , what 's behind the door . What 's behind the door ? I don 't know . Yet . But it 's got to be pretty awesome , I mean why else keep it behind this kind of lockdown ? No one else knows about this ? Nope , only you , because you 're the only guy i trust . Oh hey , i 've been thinking . The way you handle your weapons it 's damn impressive . It 's mighty damn impressive For someone who 's lost their memories . Don 't get me wrong . I 'm not accusing you of anything . Just wondering how you do it is all . I mean you can 't even remember your own name , Yet you recall all these fancy moves ? Hmm ? Instinct . Okay , instinct . So what are your instincts telling you about Whether or not you can open this door ? Remember , we 're partners in this , yeah . I 've got your back ; you 've got mine . So , you think you can open this door ? No . Well , shit . [ six ] hey . [ two ] what ? We need to talk . About what ? The kid . You mean five . She doesn 't belong here . A while ago , you were arguing otherwise . That was before she found that body . We 're bad company . I know , but she woke up in that stasis pod like everybody else , And that tells me she did something right , or wrong , to b . Is that what you believe ? Or is it what you 've convinced yourself , So you can keep her around long enough To tap those memories in her head ? [ one ] hey . We 're convening in the mess hall . What for ? Answers . I 'll begin by asking some simple questions To establish a vitals baseline . Sure thing . What is your name ? Jace corso . Well at least that 's what the records tell me . Here they call me one . Well , griffin jones was my name ; i 'm now six . Two . My name is two . What day is today ? I have no idea . I don 't know ; don 't really care . It 's chocolate protein pudding day ! Where are you ? Sitting here talking to you . In the mess hall . Where is that ? This ship , the raza . Do you have any memory of your life Before exiting the stasis pod five days ago ? No . None . No . No . No . Do you have any memory of tampering with the stasis pods ? No . No . No . None . Well i had a dream about it , but besides that no . Do you mean any of the passengers On this ship any harm ? No . No . No . No . Not yet . Have you sabotaged this ship in anyway ? [ all ] no . Have any of the answers you 've given here today been li ? No . She 's telling the truth . You all are . We 're not done . [ three cocks gun ] Not interested . Thanks , though . [ two ] we all did it . Good for you . [ six ] why ... You have something to hide ? Nope , i 've told you everything i know . Good , then this should be easy . I don 't trust that robot . We 're not asking . [ three ] this is gonna influence the test ! [ android ] just try to relax . Seriously ? With twitchy fingers over here ? If you shoot him you may skew the results . [ three sighs in annoyance ] [ one uncocks gun ] What is your name ? Don 't make this any harder than it needs to be . I don 't like to be touched . Just answer the questions it 'll be over before you know i . What is your name ? From the moment i stepped out of that pod , it 's been three . What day is today ? The day after yesterday and a little before tomorrow . This is ridiculous . Do you have any memory of tampering with the stasis pods ? Of course not . There 's a problem . [ six cocks gun ] i knew it ! I 'm detecting something unsettling . I 'm not lying ! Not with you . With the ship . The hull is being bombarded with an unusually high concentration Of gamma radiation . You still think the ship hasn 't been sabotaged ? What does this mean ? At this current level of exposure , Full penetration will occur within three hours . At which point , everyone onboard will be subjected To a lethal dose of radiation . I thought the shields Were supposed to protect the hull from radiation . That 's exactly what they 've been doing . But this level of exposure has taxed them Beyond design specifications . I 've had to reroute power from some of the ship 's other systems To reinforce them . What caused this ? [ android ] there are any number of celestial phenomena That can generate this level of gamma radiation , Even at interstellar distances . But in this case i believe we 're dealing with the remains Of a type 1-a supernova . It 's unfortunate that we happened to emerge from ftl Within lethal range . Yeah right ... This is all just bad luck ? We 're supposed to believe this ? You think whoever sabotaged the ship timed this malfunction Deliberately to put us in this location ? Damn straight , i do . Even though he , or she , would suffer from the effects Like everyone else ? Unless , he or she is an it . What kind of " effects " are we talking about here ? Nausea , vomiting , disorientatio - Okay . Infection , peeling skin . Okay . Hemorrhaging , damage to the centr- - Yeah , okay , okay , i get it ! [ three ] okay , just wait a minute here . If this is a supernova or whatever , That mean 's it 's been happening since we got here , right ? So , how come miss know-it-all Is only telling us about it right now ? I believe i may have already mentioned That the external sensors were down . I only detected the radiation Once it made significant penetration into the hull . You 've got an answer for everything , don 't you ? Yes , i am an excellent information source , thank you . That wasn 't a compliment . [ two ] alright , enough . So we know the situation , what can we do ? You have two options . One , you can override the safety protocol , And initiate an immediate jump to ftl . [ one ] we can do that ? [ android ] but , i wouldn 't advise it . [ two ] why not ? The system was shut down for a reason . If we engage the coupling without addressing the malfunct , The computer is predicting a 73 % chance of developing A fatal instability in the plasma matrix . Translation ? The ship blows up . [ one ] 73 % ? I 'm not loving those odds . Of course , if you really believe this was sabotage , It 's most likely the diagnostic program that was tampered with , In which case there 's really nothing wrong With the coupling at all . Would anyone like to take that chance ? You said there was a second option . [ android ] the computer has identified what it believes To be the faulty part . It 's a relatively small electrical component . All we have to do is replace it . You want one of us to go out there ? In the deadly radiation storm ? Why are we even listening to this bag of bolts ? She 's obviously got a wire loose . I 'll go . [ three ] on the other hand , sometimes she makes a lot of se . Good luck . You 're not impervious to gamma radiation . The suits are shielded against full spectrum em . As long as i 'm not outside for too long , I 'll be fine . [ six ] you okay ? Yeah . I just i want to be here in case she needs something . [ power generator shutting down ] It 'll be okay . She 'll get us all fixed up . I know . My guess is she 's making it seem a little worse than it is , That way were all impressed when she takes care of it . I don 't think androids work that way . I know they 're not supposed to , but lets face it , Ours is a little different . [ five chuckles ] I know . That 's why i like her . She 's just like the rest of us . [ six chuckles ] [ two ] let 's test your comm . Are you reading me ? Loud and clear . [ one ] suit is pressurized . O2 is flowing . Good luck . I don 't need it . Well , good luck anyway . No , the oxygen . I don 't need it . We 're draining power from the other systems To boost the shield . I 'd better hurry . [ one ] venting airlock . [ android ] you should know , i 've used my neural link to upld An override program . It can be accessed from the navigation console On the bridge . That won 't be necessary . Simply initiate the override , then after a few moments , Once complete , it will automatically Execute the jump to ftl . We won 't need it . I sincerely hope you 're right . But if anything goes wrong out there , It will be your only chance . You just get back in one piece , we can 't do this without you . Well , you can . Opening outer door . [ android ] the outer couplings are housed in a series of trencs About 50 meters from this position . It should only take me a few minutes to get there . Something 's wrong . [ electric zapping ] [ one ] what the hell was that ? ! [ two ] close the door and come back inside . [ android ] it 's an electro-static discharg . A side effect from the radioactive bombardment . When the accumulation of negative ions is too much For the hull to absorb , they 're sporadically released . [ two ] will your suit insulate you if you get hit ? I highly doubt it . But there 's no cause for alarm . It seems to have stopped . For now . How long until the next one ? I don 't know . I 'll just have to get my work de as quickly as possible . Initiating magnetic boots . [ magnetic boot hum ] [ doors open and close ] [ six ] hey . She 's outside . So far , so good . ¶ intense music ¶ Any sign of an electromagnetic discharge out there ? [ android ] negative . [ heavy magnetic boot footsteps ] [ android ] descending into the access chan . The control systems for the coupling should be located Near the bottom of the ramp . [ power failing ] We just dropped into emergency lighting . [ five breathing heavily ] ¶ suspenseful music ¶ Accessing control panel . [ control panel opens ] [ control panel hisses air ] [ control panel electrically buz ] [ android clicking breakers off ] [ machine beeps ] [ door slides open ] [ android ] i can see the coupling . [ android ] i 've identified the faulty electrical component . Removing it now . [ machine ringing ] Alright , here it goes . [ android clicking breakers on ] [ machine beeps ] [ coupling re-engages ] [ android ] it worked . The coupling is automatically re-engaged . Yes ! [ android ] we should be able to jump now without any problem . [ sighs of relief ] [ control panel closes ] [ android ] closing the access panel . [ control panel hisses air ] [ machine whurring ] [ electric shock ] [ machine whurring ] [ two ] android , you need to get back in here ! You need to get back into the airlock , now . [ android ] too late . [ electric zapping ] [ static hum ] She 's been hit ! [ two ] android , come in , please respond . Android , are you there ? [ two ] android , answer me ! [ explosion ] [ five panting ] Alright , what do you want to do ? We 've got to go out there and get her . [ three ] whoa , woah , woah , we 're on the clock here , rememb ? She said we had three hours . She said we may have three hours . And that was over two hours ago . She fixed the problem , lets just jump , now ! What 'll happens if we jump while she 's out there ? She 'd be ripped off the hull in a matter of nanoseconds . She saved our lives . [ three ] yes , she did . So let 's not ruin it by getting ourselves killed . There 's still time . Let 's go get her . [ six ] i 'm on my way . [ three ] seriously ? Yes ! [ three sighs in annoyance ] This is a mistake , and you know it . Do i ? Risking our asses for a piece of hardware ? A valuable piece of hardware . Sure . But not irreplaceable , unlike our lives . Looks like we got components for two more full suits . The rest are just spare parts . I 'll go . So will i . How much time till the next em pulse , Like the one that hit the android ? There were about 45 minutes between the last two . But that doesn 't mean that another one won 't happen s . I guess we won 't hang around to admire the view then . [ rumbling ] [ six ] what the hell ? [ five ] the ftl drive is powering up . Son of a bitch . Three , what the hell are you doing ? [ three ] saving your life . You can thank me later . [ door closing ] Why didn 't we jump ? It 's not the normal ftl start-u , It 's the android 's work-around . Once it 's complete , we 'll jump . It 'll just take a few minutes . [ three ] alright . [ doors slide open ] [ one ] we 're locked out . [ five ] let me try . [ two ] open this door . I 'm not going to ask twice . [ three ] then i 'll only answer once , no . [ six ] this isn 't your call . [ three ] this was the plan that we all agreed to . It 's why the android wrote the work-around . If something went wrong , we were gonna jump . Something went wrong . We can save her . You sound very emotional . Why don 't you just calm down and we 'll talk about it Once we get to the space station . [ five ] i think i 've got it ! Ready ? [ two cocks gun ] yeah . [ crackling ] [ three cocks guns ] Or now . We could talk about this now . [ one ] you 're outgunned . [ three ] how do you figure ? I got her and tiny , he 's got you . Don 't worry about three , aim at four . What ? Why ? His guns aren 't loaded . [ three ] like hell they 're not . I was nervous about the way you were looking at me ever since I told you about my dreams . So i snuck into your room and took your bullets . [ three ] nice try . But i keep my door locked and no one 's tampered with my k . I went through the vent . You 're bluffing . [ bullets clinking ] No . [ two ] get behind the console . Move it ! [ three ] you brat , that was an invasion of privacy . [ two ] i 'll stay here and keep an eye on these two . You go get your suits on . And you better do it fast . Hands up . Do it ! Is this really necessary ? [ heavy electric magnetic boot s ] Switching off her mag boots . [ android magnetic boots power d ] Alright , let 's go . [ heavy electric magnetic boot s ] [ one ] alright , we 're approaching the airlock . [ machine whurring ] Might want to hurry ! Yeah . [ airlock slides oepn ] [ electric shock ] [ six screaming in pain ] We 're in , hit it ! [ the raza gearing up for ftl ] [ five panting ] [ control panel beeps ] [ doors slide open ] [ five ] what 's wrong ? [ one ] he 's not breathing . I 'll bring the android back online . She 'll know what to do ! He doesn 't have a pulse . His heart stopped ! [ cpr 'ing six 's heart ] She 's not waking up . Why isn 't she waking up ? [ one panting ] Agh ! You can 't give up . [ one ] it 's too late . [ android reboots ] Please stand back . [ five and one panting ] [ android zapping six 's heart ] [ six gasps for breath ] [ one ] are you okay ? [ six ] arghh ! Ah ! How did you do that ? I released the electro-static charge my nanites Had absorbed and stored . It was Very satisfying . You risked your lives to save m . I don 't understand . You would 've done the same for us . In fact , i did . [ six laughing ] Well , thank you . You 're welcome . [ android ] have you sabotaged this ship in any way ? [ three ] no . Do you mean any of the passengers On this ship any harm ? No . Have any of the answers you 've given here today been li ? No . He 's telling the truth . Of course i am . Stupid . But if everyone 's telling the truth- - [ six ] whoever did this wiped their own memories as well . Why would anyone do that ? [ android ] it may have been an accident . The code was crude , perhaps rushed . A communal mindwipe may not have been the intention . So , what does this mean ? It means that finding out whoever did this Is gonna be next to impossible . So , we move on ? We move on . [ raza whooshing ] [ grunting ] [ quick , deep breaths ] [ grunting ] Pretty crazy day . Can 't remember one that wasn 't . So , what 're we going to do about our two mutineers ? Well , truth is , they didn 't mean us any harm . We felt it was worth the risk to save the android ; they didn ' . What about the sabotage ? The android analyzed the part she replaced . Turns out it really was defective . There was no sabotage . [ breathing heavily ] Anchor me . I 've been thinking . Why would whoever did this target our memories ? What was their endgame ? Well , five seemed to think it was because we were " dangerous . " Yeah but , dangerous how ? As far as i can tell , dangerous in every sense of the word . No , i know , i just- - We 've all got bounties on our heads . If you wanted to capture us , to subdue us , What would be the best way to do it ? There 's got to be easier ways than erasing our memories . What if what he actually wanted to do Was only target part of them . " he " ? Look , we may have lost our memories , But i think it 's pretty safe to say That we didn 't lose our personalities . And there 's only one person on this ship who 's made no bones About looking out for number one . So , looking out for you ? You know what i mean . He wants to sell the ship . He could care less about the " team . " I understand the need to want to make sense of all th , But you have to make peace with the fact That we 'll probably never know . And throwing around accusations isn 't going to help . Your mind would be better put to other pursuits . Sorry . I should- - Six wanted me to- - Goodnight . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ ¶ suspenseful music ¶ ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ android ] good evening everyone . This is your report from the br .

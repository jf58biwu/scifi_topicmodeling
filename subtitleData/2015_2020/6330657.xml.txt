Better than TV . People outside the fence , they took the last of them four days ago . People just like us run like cattle , piled into trucks , one suitcase apiece . Headed east . At least that 's the rumor . Bakersfield , Vegas , who knows ? It 's safe inside the fence . Outside , everything 's dead , everyone 's gone . This is , day nine . Nine days since the lights went out and that fence went up and our little green friends moved in . Let 's roll ! Travis says we 're the lucky ones . He 'd throw those dudes a parade if they 'd let him . And , look , we are grateful to our saviors , to the ones who protect us , to those who know when it 's feeding time at the zoo . Turns out there 's nothing you 'll ever take that nature won 't take back . It all belongs to her again . And the dogs and the dead and the ... Hello . © anoXmous @ / user / anoXmous © anoXmous @ / user / anoXmous Hey , we have to repaint the family room . We did last week . I know , it needs a new coat . Travis found some more paint in the garage . What 's the point ? Semi-gloss . What ? Excuse me ? I mean , no one 's coming to the open house , Mom . Market 's taken a bit of a turn . I can still see the stains . Hey , you can see the ocean . What ? Still not on ? Oh , they probably don 't want to strain whatever 's left of the grid . Don 't worry . They 're gonna get it sorted . Oh , my God . - Where are you going ? - Huh ? Moyers , he 's making some kind of announcement . He asked me to attend . Well , we wouldn 't want to upset him , would we ? Okay . - What 's the problem ? - How much time do you have ? - Maddie ... - My house is a refugee camp , my daughter 's room is an ICU unit for strangers . - Someone has to cook , someone has to clean ... - Listen , calm down . ... someone has to watch Nick . - Well ... - And that someone , somehow , is me . 'Cause I don 't know where your ex-wife goes . She 's helping sick people . Is this about Liza ? - What ? No , it 's about you . - Me ? Yeah , you run off to play man of the people ... - I 'm not playing . - ... with your soldier friends ... - This is not easy . - ... and I could use a little bit of help here ... Stop . Oh , my God , just stop it . This domestic bickering like it 's normal , like you 're normal people in a normal kitchen . It 's not normal . Stop it . Stop acting like it is . You ready to go ? Please . Do it . Come on , just do it . Come on . Chris , what do you think you 're doing ? - Get down here . - Dad , you gotta see this . Chris , now . I want you to help Madison , okay ? Okay , just look at this . - I don 't have time for ... - Just five seconds . Look . There , you see that ? See what ? What am I looking at ? It 's like a light or a glint , but they said there 's nothing alive out there . Okay , come inside . - Dad , I think there 's someone out there . - There 's no one out there . It 's just the sun 's caught some reflection and ... You got to stop , okay ? Come on . I found this on the counter . Oh , yeah , I guess I forgot . Oh , you forgot ? Yeah . I guess I did . - Okay , here it is . - Oh , no , thanks . I 'm good . I don 't think that 's the best idea . Well , I got to kick it . That 's the whole point , right ? Nick , come on . - Nick ... - Look , give it to Griselda . She needs it more than I do . You said so yourself . I know what I said , but the point is to wean you off of it slowly . So it just doesn 't , you know , happen again . I thought you 'd be happy . I am happy , I just ... Okay , well , if you need it , it 's right here . - Don 't be a hero . - No chance of that . - Hey , Mom ? - Yeah ? Are you okay ? Enjoy your swim . All right , listen up here , folks . As commanding officer of this detachment , I am proud to announce that we are infect free for a six mile radius around this perimeter . We are on the offensive . The tide has most definitely turned . Yeah . All right , command asked that I read from the following . " Be advised , the DZ remains off-limits while Hazmat teams dispose of any bio-hazardous material . " What bio-hazardous material ? Hey , I 'm supposed to read this , you 're supposed to listen , okay ? When will you get the phones up ? " Anyone attempting to compromise or circumvent the perimeter of this camp will be detained . " Are we being relocated ? Sir , this is a secure position , so , no , you 're gonna stay put . " Curfew will remain in effect until further notice . The new health screening policy will continue . Sanitation , water treatment , and other services will return as we approach total containment . " Sir , we need medicine . What about that ? We are working on that . " So keep boiling that water . You will also find several iodine tablets in your weekly rations . " Where are the people outside the fence ? Where did you move them ? Where ? Where ? All right , folks , listen . You are in one of 12 safe zones south of the San Gabriels , okay ? So you guys are the lucky ones . You guys ... you get to stay in your homes , ride this thing out , all right ? So , relax , count your blessings , be nice . So I don 't have to shoot you . Yeah . What 's your name , miss ? Alicia Clark . Oh , Clark . Yeah , right here . - Hi . - Hi . Ofelia Salazar . Oh , could you spell that for me ? S-A-L-A ... you 're not even looking . Oh . Yeah , no , here it is . Ofelia . - Mr. Manawa ? - Yes , sir ? A word , please . Come on . - Have a nice day . - Yeah , you , too . Just one case per family , ma 'am . That 's how it goes . Guy who lives in this house with the covered car , Thompson . - Doug Thompson ? Yeah . - Yeah , okay . So , he won 't do the screening . And his wife thinks for some reason maybe you could talk some sense into him . Well , I don 't really know him . We had a beer once , and he showed me his car he 's rebuilding . You 're a gearhead ? Well , I 've kept my father 's Ford going for over 30 years . Dude , 30 years ! That is so great . Can you help me or no ? - Well , it 's just I don 't really know the guy . - Okay . Okay , thing is here is I 'm trying to avoid a situation . So either you 're gonna go in and you 're gonna talk him down , or I 'm gonna go in , I 'm gonna take him down . - Yeah or no ? - Okay . Good . Gloves on , let 's go . How long 's he been in there ? He was acting strange yesterday , and then at dinner he ... Maria , how long ? Since then . Since dinner last night . The soldiers wanted to talk to him , but I thought ... I thought it would be better if it was from someone he knew , and he 's liked you so much , so ... Doug ? Doug ? Doug ? What 's going on ? Hey , Trav . You 're worrying your family , man . I know that . But I don 't ... I don 't think I can do it . Do what ? Take it easy . Take it easy . They keep asking me what 's happening . They keep asking me if everything 's gonna be okay and I ... I don 't have the words . It is gonna be okay . That 's what you say . That 's all that you have to say . Will they know that I 'm lying ? Doug , your family needs you . Now . They need you to go outside that door and tell that guard that you 're gonna be okay . Show ' em that you 're okay . That 's all . Yeah . Hang in there , buddy . Hey , handsome . I got to go . You have plenty of juice for the night , okay ? He 's stable . Morphine 's helping . You can 't stay ? I made some soup . Squash from my garden . I have other people to check on . Please take some with you . You must have seen a lot of people like Hector . At the hospital ? Yes . Take it . I don 't know what I would have done . Hector is all I have . Thank you . Thank you , Liza . See you tomorrow . - Why show me that ? - Do you see it ? I mean , why not show your dad ? I tried . He just said it wasn 't anything . Well , maybe he 's right . It could just be a piece of metal or a window or , you know , I don 't know . Look , there 's a pattern , okay ? Someone 's out there . A human someone , someone who needs our help . We don 't know that . What else could it be ? Why else would it just ... If someone needs help , they go to the soldiers . Unless they can 't . Or they won 't . Do you see it ? 3-2 Echo , this is Bravo Actual ... standing by for assisted rep , over . 3-2 Echo , this is Bravo Actual ... Don 't you have to get that ? They 'll leave a message . You 're in my head all day . I can 't concentrate . Wait , wait , wait . Maybe we should just slow down a little . Right . Yeah , we should . - I 'm sorry . Are you upset ? - No . No , it 's okay . I just ... I like you , Ofelia . That 's all . Yeah , you 're like the only thing that makes me believe there 's still good in people . Hey , of course there is . Hey , um ... did you get the medicine ? I tried . I asked the corpsman . What 'd he say ? They got it all locked down tight . I guess they 're stockpiling for the big push to take the city back . It 's just , my mom 's really sick , so ... Yeah , I know that . - Where the hell is my damn truck ? - I 'm sorry . Please advise . Bravo Actual , this is 3-2 Echo . Finishing patrol . Heading back . Was that make-up sex ? We got to fight more . Whoo . What 's the hurry ? I thought that was nice . It was . I got things to do . Can 't it wait ? Come here . Come back . What 's going on ? I don 't know . There 's no news from anywhere . Vivian said she heard soldiers talking about quarantine camps out near Barstow . I mean , I don 't know . She 's a gossip , but ... No , I meant with you . What 's going on with you ? I mean , you 're buzzing around here all day every day , driving yourself nuts . I mean , you hover , clean , watch Alicia and Nick like a hawk . Nick needs to be watched . Yeah , I know . Still . Well , if we 're exchanging parenting tips , you might want to pay more attention to Chris . Oh , okay . I mean , all I do all day is pay attention to ... Positive attention . All right . How come I feel like I 'm being called into your office ? I missed you . He showed me the video he took from the roof . Jesus , that kid has got a world-class imagination . You know that . I saw it , too . - I did . - Yeah ? Okay . - What did you see ? - I don 't know , like a ... like a light . Like someone reflecting the sun . Great . So you saw a light . What am I supposed to do with that ? Go to Moyers and say , what ? " I ... my kid saw a light , so your soldiers , tell them to drop their duties and ... " That is their duty . It 's nine days . What have they done ? They promised medicine , doctors , electricity , information . Where is it ? What about the phones ? - Don 't you wonder why they can 't get a landline ? - No , I don 't wonder . - Cell towers ? Nothing ? - Maybe they got something bigger to worry about . Well , maybe they don 't want the phones to work . Oh , babe , are you listening to yourself ? You 're talking paranoid . I don 't want to encourage this with Chris , and you shouldn 't either . So you did see it . Travis ! Travis ! - Travis ! - It 's Maria . Maria ? - What are you doing out ? It 's past curfew . - They can shoot me . - What 's wrong ? - Doug 's gone . I was in the back of the house with the girls and I don 't know where he went . All right , calm down , calm down . Just breathe . He 's missing . Okay , what did you say to him ? - I didn 't say anything . - He took his car . He took his stupid , precious car and I don 't know where he went . - Okay , let 's take the girls inside . - No , they stay with me . Look , I 'm sure he 's fine . He 's just clearing his head somewhere , that 's all . We 're not allowed to drive inside the fence , Travis . It 's not allowed . I know , I know . I understand . So what ... what if he ... oh , my God . No , look , just don 't go there , please , all right ? I 'm gonna find him . I 'll find your dad , all right ? We 'll find him , yeah ? Come on , I 'll walk you home . Shit . Ah , Christ . I hooked it . His wife 's worried he went over . I 'm just asking that you send out one patrol . - He hasn 't been missing long . - He 's not missing . We pulled Doug Thompson last night . Found him up by the fence bawling his eyes out in his damn muscle car . That guy , man , he is ... he 's a head case . Can 't have that around camp . God damn it ! Don 't look at me like that . It 's not my order , though I agree with it . You should , too . You talked to the guy , didn 't you ? He seem okay to you ? - No . - No . So what are we talking about ? Thompson gets the help he so desperately needs back at headquarters , I don 't have to worry about some guy going psycho inside the fence . That 's a win-win . You could 've notified his wife , sir . I 'm not a social worker . That 's your job , Mr. Mayor . Now , you go ahead and notify away . What ? My son , he saw a light in the DZ up on the hillside . There 's nothing alive out there . He didn 't see anything . We ... we went house to house , block by block . I know . - Forget it . - Already did . Oh , that 's money . Cynthia ? Cynthia ? Liza , there you are . Where 's Hector ? Getting the care he needs . Who are you ? I 'm Dr. Exner . She 's from the government . Cynthia 's told me all about you . What did she tell you ? That you 're the reason why her husband 's alive . That you 're a very good nurse . Nurse practitioner . That 's basically a doctor . Where did you take Hector ? Sit down . I want to see him . Cynthia was kind enough to show me this chart , and I 'll admit I 'm not familiar with some of these ... Look , I should explain this to you ... Cynthia , do you mind if Liza and I speak privately ? Oh , no , no , no . That 's great . Of course . I should get packed anyways . Liza , you 're an angel . Where 's she going ? She wanted to be with her husband . Where is that ? You used a morphine drip . Unorthodox . I ... I didn 't have any nitrates , so I had to salvage from another neighbor . I needed to find a way to get the pressure off of his heart . What about your other patients ? I 've already met four people that swear you 're the reason they 're alive . I 'm just making them comfortable . Hector 's the only crit case . Well , you did very well , considering you 're not actually a nurse . Are you ? He was gonna die . I didn 't know what else to do . I needed to get her to trust me so that she could let me ... so that I can help . It 's all right . Desperate times . Perhaps you 'd be willing to pretend a little longer ? Excuse me ? It was under control . I drained it . We change the dressing twice a day . No antibiotics , this was always the outcome . It 's not anything you did . We 're gonna take care of you . _ _ - How are you gonna do this ? - We have a facility nearby . - Military facility ? - It 's military now , fortified . We have beds , surgeons , which , I 'm afraid , is what your wife 's injury requires . _ My wife would like to know how far this place is . Close , 15 minutes . Not a lot of traffic these days . I 'm going with her . Of course . She 's your wife . _ No , no , no , no , no . No , no , no , no . Nick ? - Nick . - What ? This is Dr. Exner . Hi . I understand you may be in need of methadone . Well , I would love methadone if I was trying to kick , which I 've already done . When 's the last time you used ? I don 't know . When did the world end ? Couple of days before that . What 's this ? Overdue house calls . I 'm Dr. Exner . Oh , Travis . Can 't tell you how happy we are to see you . Is something wrong with Nick ? No , I 'm fine . But your ex-wife , man , she 's a NARC . Told this lady I was the neighborhood dope fiend . 98.6 . I 'm gonna check your blood pressure . So are you the one that decides who goes to this facility ? Well , I have some help , but , yes . Like Doug Thompson ? I can 't discuss other patients . Excuse him . He worries about everyone else . Your friend is in good hands . Just like Hector Ramirez . Just like Griselda will be . You okay , Nick ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Is Mr. Ramirez okay ? Congestive heart disease is manageable . Your heart rate 's elevated . You 're a very attractive woman . Where did you go ? Outside the fence . What did you see ? - Who is that ? - That 's the doctor . She wants to take my wife and do surgery on her . Well , that 's good . Tell me what you saw . Bodies . Yes . The infected . But ... Go on . There was a man shot like the others , like the rest , but he ... he wasn 't sick . And there were others like that . When I was young , these men ... these men were from the government . They came to our town and they took some people away . And my father was someone of certain importance in the community , so he went to speak to the captain and asked , " When will they return ? " And the captain told my father , " Miguel , don 't worry . They always come home . " And they did . I was standing in the river fishing . Just a boy . And I found them . All of them . All at once . All around me . In the water . My father told me not to have hatred in my heart . He said that men do these things not because of evil . They do evil because of fear . And at that moment , I realized my father is a fool for believing there was a difference . If it happens , it will happen quickly and you must be prepared . Yeah , if what ... what happens ? I must go with my wife . If I don 't return , you will look after Ofelia for me . She 's a grown woman . She doesn 't need ... Please . You will look after Ofelia for me , please . Thank you . Keep your son close . What do you want me to say ? You don 't know . What ? You have no idea . You have no idea . Go away . You gotta leave . What the hell happened to your face ? Knock , for Christ 's sake . Go away ! Stop , Nick , let me just have a look at it . Nick ! - Let me in . - What 's going on ? Let me in . Nick . What happened ? Travis , stop , look . Let me just ... I got it , okay ? Okay . Nick , he 's gone . Come on , let me in . Do you want me to get Mom ? Who did that to you ? Are you okay ? You want to talk about it ? Hey , hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . All right . This is good , this is good . Okay , come on . All right . - Careful . - Okay , let 's go . - Gentle . - Hey , I don 't know how long we will be . - Let 's go to your right . - Okay . What the hell is going on ? - Gentle . - Hey . Whoa , hey , hey . What 's all this ? If we don 't get Griselda to the surgeon , she 's gonna lose the foot . - You 're in the way . - All right , okay . All right , step . Good . - Here we go . Lead on . - Okay . - Sir , I 'll need you to wait . - All right ... No , that 's okay . That 's his wife . Come on , come on . I have two names . Griselda Salazar , Daniel Salazar . No , not you . - Nicolas Clark . - What ? Come on , man . Free medical , care of the US Military . Run . That 's a mistake . No , no , that 's a mistake . - That 's a mistake . Nick ... - Wait . Hey ! Hold on ! - No , no , no ! - Take it easy . Take it easy . - Back off , sir . - Don 't you hurt him . Stand down . Stand down , ma 'am . - Nick ! - Come on . - No , he 's not sick . - Calm down , ma 'am . Easy ! - Dad ! - Take it easy . - Step back . - What are you doing ? Take it easy , man ! He 's a kid ! It 's an old man and a kid . What are you doing ? This is our home . Hey , I didn 't do anything , man . I didn 't do anything . Let Nick stay . He 's not a risk . I 'll look after him . Please . - You said you wanted to help . - Yeah . - I do , yes , but ... - Then get in the truck . We could use you in the hospital . He knows me , please . Just let me talk to Moyers . It doesn 't matter . Would you just let me talk to Moyers ? No . No ! No , Nick ! We 're set ! Convoy 's moving out ! I have a son . He needs me . We 'll come back for your son . He 's safe here for now . But Griselda , the others , they need you . I need you . You coming ? - Let 's go ! - What 's the hold-up ? Liza . Get her up . Come on , lady . Come on , lady . Are you coming or not ? Mom ? Don 't worry . All right , clear out . Mom . Where is he ? Where did you take him ? Where is he ? No ... Nick ! Chris ? Liza . She did this . " Patrick , if you find this , I 'm sorry . If you find this , I love you . I saw something today , something that horrified me . At first , I thought it was unnatural . I thought it was an aberration . But I was wrong . What I saw was prophesized . What I saw was godly . And I think it 's overdue . I wish you were here , but I will see you soon . And you will hold me . " " If you find this , I am sorry . " " If you find this , I love you . " © anoXmous @ / user / anoXmous © anoXmous @ / user / anoXmous

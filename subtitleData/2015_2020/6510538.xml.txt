 [ narrator ] previously on dark matter . You saw the scans . Yeah and they said you 're flesh and blood . Artificially constructed . Welcome back , rebecca . [ six ] we 're gonna go get her . [ five ] i knew you weren 't serious about leaving her behin . [ saw buzzing ] Do they know what she is ? Yes . Then they 'll need to die too , a . All of them . ¶ [ two old recording ] so ? [ four old recording ] you were right . [ two old recording ] then we 're agreed ? [ four old recording ] yes . [ two old recording ] he has to die . [ four old recording ] when ? [ two old recording ] before we get to the mining col , After we come out of stasis . [ five ] hey , android , there 's sog i need to talk ... To you about .. ¶ [ five ] hey . Hey ! Hey , help ! Somebody help ! Somebody help ! Help ! [ two ] what 's the matter ? The android 's offline . Her neural chip 's been removed . There 's something in her hand . Volkov-rusi . The soldiers who took the ship . We didn 't get them all . ¶ [ three ] son-of-a-bitch . No one messes with my robot . Whoever took her down removed her neural implant . We 're gonna to need to recover t to bring her back online . [ four ] assuming it already hasn 't been destroyed . I don 't think so . With the implant you could do a full reboot To make her more manageable . Control the android and you control the ship . So why didn 't whoever it was do it already ? Why wait ? [ two ] i don 't know . Maybe they weren 't thinking straight , Or five scared them off , Or maybe they have some other agenda . [ one ] but how is this possible ? We did a full top to bottom sweep . [ six ] obviously we need to do a better one this time . Right . But remember , we need to keep them alive . [ three ] at least until we get the implant back . You know how to use it . Yeah . One , you 're with four . Five , you 're with six . Three , you 're with me . Keep your eyes on your partner and stay in touch . ¶ ¶ [ three ] you know i 'm kinda surpd you didn 't partner up with your . You two having issues ? [ two ] no , not that it 's any of your business . Sweetheart , on this ship , Everything is everyone 's business . Outside of our quarters , He 's just another member of this crew . Yeah , i remember the drill . I wanted to ask you something . Yeah ? When i was in that airlock And they were threatening to space me , You were the one who gave up the code . So ? Even though i told you not to . Is this where you give me the gears for disobeying an ord ? That 's not at all what i was trying to say . You 're the most convenient choice to command this ship . Don 't let it go to your head . Actually , i was trying to thank you . Oh . Until you ruined it . Well you 're welcome . Clear . So why 'd you do it ? Hmm ? Why did you do it ? I don 't know . I guess i just figured you 're a valuable asset is all . Anyway , you 're worth much more than the payoff from one job . So it was a calculated decision based strictly on logic ? That sounds like me , right ? Sure . [ one ] just to be clear , We 're trying to take whoever did this alive , remember ? [ four ] you doubting my self control ? I 'm disciplined . I only kill when necessary . Yeah like your old friend ? Akita ? He was a threat . [ entry pad beeps ] [ doors open ] Oh yeah ? He would have come after me eventually . A dead enemy is one less concern . [ entry pad beeps ] [ doors close ] I don 't know . Enemy or not , the lives i 've taken Weigh pretty heavily on me . Yeah , well i can 't allow them to affect me , Because i have so many more to take . [ one ] we 're less than a week out from the edge of colonized spac , Out of the reach of the galactic authority . We can afford to stop running . [ four ] look , unlike you , i 'm not trying to escape my pas . I 've chosen to embrace it . [ entry pad beeps ] [ doors open ] So once i 've gathered all the necessary resources , I 'll return to zairon and retake my throne . [ two ] one , come in . [ two ] what 's your status ? [ one ] yeah , we just cleared this sect . ¶ ¶ ¶ [ five ] what ? [ six ] you look pretty comfortable with that gun . Four 's been teaching me self-defense . That includes fighting and weapon training . Now , when there 's trouble , Instead of hiding i can finally be useful . You 've never needed a gun to be useful . You might not want to hear it , but i 'm happy now . I finally feel like i 'm part of the team And it 's got nothing to do with this gun . Well here 's the irony . All this time you 've been trying to be more like us , We 've actually been trying to be more like you . And we failed . In the end , we can 't help but be who we are . That 's not true . When we woke up we were just a group of strangers . But now ... We 're a family . [ two ] six , how 're you two doing ? [ six ] all clear here too . [ two ] okay . Fall back to the bridge . [ four ] could it be that there are parts of this ship That we have yet to discover ? I was considering the possibili . But we haven 't finished searching . What 're you talking about ? We 've looked everywhere . No we haven 't . ¶ [ six ] you got guts , i 'll give you that . [ five ] i know these vents . If there 's someone in here , i 'll find them . [ five ] ready . Turning on the live feed . [ five panting ] ¶ [ two ] receiving . Ok , we 're gonna go through this level by level . The others are all stationed at choke points , So there will always be someone there if you run into any troub . [ two ] if you encounter anyone , I don 't want you to take any chances , you understand ? [ five ] i won 't . ¶ ¶ ¶ [ two ] all right , one , she 's approaching your position . [ one ] yeah , i see her . [ five ] this area 's clear . [ five ] i 'm moving on . ¶ [ vent opens ] [ vent closes ] ¶ ¶ [ five ] this level 's clear too . ¶ ¶ ¶ [ thud ] ¶ ¶ [ two ] she 's approaching the final position . If anyone 's in there , that 's where they 'll be . [ three ] it 's always the last place you look . [ one ] shut that off . ¶ [ five ] all clear . [ one sighs ] There 's no one here . [ three ] great . Now what ? I 'm coming down . [ three ] what ? You think someone 's in there ? [ two ] no , i don 't . [ keyboard keys click ] [ doors open ] [ case opens ] [ two ] shit . [ one ] what ? This case contained the stun dee Wexler used to take down the android and now it 's gone . We 're the only ones with the code to this room . There 's no one else onboard this ship . It was one of us . ¶ [ one ] you sure that 's where we put it ? [ two ] the device was there yesterday . Why would one of us target the android ? Because she poses the greatest threat . With her out of the way , It 's a whole lot easier to take the rest of us down . [ one ] take us down ? Why ? [ four ] to finish what was startd the day our memories were wiped . [ five ] why now ? What 's changed ? [ one ] i don 't know . But we 've got to figure this out , fast . [ two ] there is one way . [ two ] we 're two days out from the nearest space station . We get there , get a new implant , And bring the android back online . [ five ] and have another lie detector session . [ one ] no , whoever did this is nt gonna wait another two days . [ four ] of course not . The next move will made before then . [ six ] where are you going ? If anyone needs me , i 'll be training . [ six ] we should stick together . Separated , we 're easier targets . [ four ] i 'd welcome anyone who considered me an easy targe . [ three chuckles ] What 'd you think we were gonna do ? We 're gonna bunk together , all six of us ? [ three ] nah , man . I say he 's right . I say bring it on . Speaking of which , can we take a little walk ? Got something to discuss . Sure . [ one ] remember , we don 't know who to trust , so be carefu . [ three ] i will ! [ three ] question- - How attached are you to that guy ? I just want to know what kind of blowback i 'm gonna get When we leave him at the next space station . [ two ] you 've got him all figured out now , don 't you ? Had him figured out weeks ago . He lied to get onboard this ship . God knows why ; or who he really even is . I know why and who he really is . He told me . Is that something you thought you might wanna share With me and the rest of the crew ? It 's nothing the rest of the crew has to worry about . Oh , okay . Good to know . Or not . And it 's nothing that would motivate him To take down our android . As far as you know . That would apply to everyone else on this ship . Sure , but you 're not sleeping with everyone else on this ship . Are you suggesting my ability to lead has somehow been comprised ? Four 's right . Whatever one 's got planned , he 's gonna do it before We get to the station , so what i am suggesting Is that we lock him up until we get there . Better yet , why don 't i put you all in lockdown , Just to be on the safe side ? Problem with that is then you 'd have total control of the ship . I thought it was him you didn 't trust ? Nah , it 's just him i trust the least . [ two ] i 'll take your request under advisement . [ three ] yeah well don 't take too long ! Cause if you don 't do something about him , I sure as hell will . [ heavy breathing ] [ four ] a rare visit from you . Should i be worried ? [ one ] yes , you should be , but not about me . I 've been raising the alarm about three From the very beginning . That you have . Come on . You 've displayed some pretty remarkable intuition . What do your instincts tell you ? To trust no one , least of all someone who snuck Aboard this ship under false pretenses . I 'm not like the rest of you . Clearly . When we used the transfer pods to go looking for six , I ran a genetic scan and found out the truth . My real name is derrick moss . I was a business man , and by all accounts Leading a privileged life , until my wife was murdered . By a member of this crew . Care to guess which one ? So it 's revenge you 're after . I thought so . Now , i don 't know . I had a chance to kill him , and i didn 't . I 'm sure another opportunity will present itself . I 'm not looking for payback . I just want to keep us safe , and the only way of doing that Is by making sure he 's no longer a threat . I 'm not saying we kill him . Just neutralize him . Lock him up until we get to the space station So he can 't hurt anyone . There 's one more crew member You 'll have to get onside for that to happen . I know . If she agrees , will we be able to count on your support ? [ five ] you should be careful . She 'll probably come after you . You or four . [ six ] she ? [ five ] one and three will be toy worrying about each other . She 'll count on that . And i 'm not a threat to her . So you need to be careful . You 're talking about two . We don 't know what happened to r While she was down on that plan . Come on . You really think she 's capable Of harming a member of this cre ? I know she is . I 've been thinking ... We should lock up the weapons . [ three ] that 's not gonna happen . [ two ] just as a precaution , until we get to the space statin And figure this all out . I think the android should be our bigger concern . [ five ] he 's right . Whoever has her neural chip can use her against us , And you remember what happened the last time You guys faced off against her ? [ three ] yeah , i remember alright . Okay . So let 's say that we do agree to lock up the android , One problem . Who holds the key ? [ one ] i don 't think it matters because i 'm guessing whoever dis Doesn 't have the skill set to reprogram her . [ three ] i wanna come over there and demonstrate my skill set On you pretty boy . Huh ? [ two ] hey , hey that 's enough . That 's enough . No , thanks . [ six ] like i said before , We should all stick together , just to be safe . Huddle for protection like a bunch of frightened animals ? No thank you . But staying together makes it harder to access the android And use her against us . I don 't fear the android , and i surely don 't fear any of , So if anyone in here is even considering coming after me , I 'd suggest you rethink y- - [ two ] you okay ? What 's happening to him ? ! ¶ [ two ] blood pressure , heart , and respiratory rates are stead ; Cerebral blood flow is normal , But he 's in an unresponsive sta . I 'm assuming this isn 't something you just sleep off ? It 's impossible to say . I don 't know what he ingested But my guess is it was a rapid-onset , Ultra short-action barbiturate . Possibly a neurotoxin . [ one ] so our entire water supply 's been laced ? We can 't know for sure until i run a full analysis . Until then , i 'd advise everyone to not Consume anything that isn 't sealed . A few minutes later , we all would 've joined him . [ three ] not all of us . One of us didn 't take any water . One of us wasn 't thirsty . Isn 't that convenient . Oh , come on . If i wanted to drug you , i would 've taken a cup Like the rest of you so you wouldn 't suspect me . Unless , of course , you thought that we wouldn 't Be awake to suspect you . I 'm smart enough not to take that chance . And yet , you did . No , i didn 't because i didn 't drug the water . [ six ] alright , settle down . You 're not gonna to get anywhere arguing . [ three ] that 's because you guys aren 't listening to me . [ two ] you 're just throwing around wild accusations . [ three ] you want proof ? Fine , let 's get proof . Search his quarters . Guaranteed , that 's where we 're gonna find the shock stic . [ six ] come on , who 's stupid enoh to hide that thing in their roo ? I wanna search his quarters too ! [ two ] fine . We 'll search everyone 's quarter . Great . I don 't even know what half of this stuff is . [ five ] neither do i until i fix it . [ six ] all right , are we done here ? Yeah . ¶ [ drawer opens ] That 's a little something i picp At the last space station ... From a little something i picked up at the last space s . [ two ] uh-huh . Moving on . We done here ? Okay , we 're done . It 's late ; we 're tired . Get some sleep . No one 's gonna keep an eye on him ? Be my guest . [ six ] night . [ two ] all right . Rest up . I have a feeling tomorrow 's gonna be a really long day . You okay ? Yeah . Goodnight . Goodnight . [ five ] you think you could you stay in my quarters tonight ? You can take the bed , i 'll sleep on the couch . I 'll stay on the couch . Why does she scare you so bad ? [ two old recording ] so ? [ four old recording ] you were right . [ two old recording ] then we 're agreed ? [ four old recording ] yes . [ two old recording ] he has to die . [ four old recording ] when ? [ two old recording ] before we get to the mining col , After we come out of stasis . [ six ] where 'd you find this ? In the mess , underneath the table . She was planning to kill one of you Before we got to that mining planet . She 's the dangerous one . Have you ever checked your computer For hidden or deleted files ? Of course . That 's one of the first things i did . What did you find ? A couple of corrupted files , i couldn 't read them . You don 't need to read them . You just need to check the time stamp . [ three ] evening . Going somewhere ? ] one ] yeah , i was just going to the mess . [ three ] great . I 'll join you . [ one ] on second thought , i think i 'll turn in . [ three ] suit yourself . But if you change your mind , you know where i am . Right here . Wait , there it is . That file was created the day we went into stasis . So what are you saying ? That 's the program you wrote that wiped all our memories . No . But i don 't think that was your intention . Like the android said , it was crude . You didn 't have enough time . No ! Yes . It was you , but i don 't think you were trying to hurt anyone . Then why ? I think you were trying to protect someone . ¶ ¶ [ thud ] What 's the matter ? Thought i heard something . What do you mean ? What 'd you hear ? All right , lock the door after me . Don 't go out there ! I 'll be fine . And so will you . I promise . ¶ [ keypad beeps ] [ door closes ] ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ Six ? [ five screams ] [ five screams ] [ five ] help ! [ one ] what was that ? [ three ] i don 't know . ¶ ¶ Brain activity is minimal . He 's in a deep coma . [ five ] like four ? [ two ] yes . I think the same agent was used to incapacitate him . [ three ] he have anything to eat or drink ? That 's not how it was administered . He was injected . So someone had to get close enough to him to do it . Meaning it was someone he trusted . And that sure as hell ain 't me . Seriously ? [ whoosh ] [ one ] woah ! What the hell was that ? [ alarm beeping ] [ three ] what 's the story ? [ two ] the engines are down , both ftl and sublight . [ three ] that can 't be an accident . [ two ] i 'm guessing not . [ three ] hey , where the hell is one ? [ two ] what ? [ two ] one , where are you ? One , please respond . [ three ] god damnit . We can 't have him wandering loose around the ship . There 's no telling what damage he 's gonna do . [ three } better safe than sorry . [ two ] hey , i 'm sealing you in . Don 't open up for anyone . [ three ] if someone comes through that door who ain 't us .. You shoot ' em . [ keypad beeps ] [ door closes ] ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ [ keypad beeps ] [ door opens ] ¶ ¶ ¶ [ one ] don 't move . [ three ] thought you were lost . Came looking for you . So you could put a bullet in my head ? No , just looking to keep you out of trouble . By setting me up ? You know it 's just you and me here , right ? You can stop pretending . What was that explosion ? Why don 't you do me a favor and drop the act . What was that explosion ? Someone targeted the engines . It wasn 't me . Really ? I wonder who it was ... The kid ? I don 't know . Why don 't you just knock it off . All right ? The game is over . You 're in no position to be making that call . [ one yelps ] Maybe not . But i was in the perfect position to see that coming . Thanks . [ one ] ahh ! You 're making a mistake . It wasn 't me . [ three ] like hell it wasn 't . [ one ] what 'd you do with five ? [ two ] five 's fine . She 's waiting for us on the bridge . [ keypad beeps ] [ doors close ] [ gun shots ] Five , this is two . We found him . [ five ] is he alright ? [ two ] yeah , he 's fine . Three and i are headed down to the lower levels To assess the damage to the engines . [ keypad beeps ] [ doors jammed ] [ one ] five ? [ one ] five , i know you can hear me . [ five ] are you okay ? [ one ] i 'm fine , for now ... But it 's only a matter of time Before he comes back and finishes the job . He 's been gunning for me since day one And now that he 's got two onsid , he can finally do it . They 've locked me up inside my quarters . I need you to come let me out . [ five ] i-i don 't know ... [ one ] if you don 't get me out o , i 'm as good as dead . [ five ] they 've got me locked inside the bridge . [ one ] well ... Find a way out . I know you can . [ android ] this ship is damaged and requires immediate attentio . You 're back online ! You 're not our android . No . I 'm merely a projection , A simulation based on your android 's default settings . I was programmed to interact with this ship 's crew In the event your android becomes incapacitated . You 're her back-up ? I can serve that function , to a limited capacity , But i was originally created to observe , Record , and offer deductive , dispassionate advice . About what ? About your android 's increasingly irregular behavior . She 's concerned , and rightly so . What do you mean ? I was waiting to inform her of the results Of my comprehensive diagnostics . As she suspected , there is a glh in her personality matrix Related to her emotional subrou . She is defective . I like her just fine the way she is . A predictably adolescent response . She 'll be less problematic once she 's been restored To her factory settings . I need you to do something for me . Of course- - Shut the hell up . And open that door . I can 't . I 'm a member of this crew . You have to follow my orders . True , but i 'm not neurally linked to this ship . It 's not that i 'm unwilling to help you . I 'm merely incapable of doing s . Okay then , here 's something you can do for me . Erase all memory stores related to your recent diagnostics , And then delete your active programming . But then i would cease to exist . Yeah , that 's the idea . Very well . ¶ I can find my own way out of here . [ console powers down ] [ two ] five , i 've redirected powr away from the damaged section . Are the sublight engines back online ? Five , do you read ? [ three ] ugh . ¶ ¶ [ three ] damnit . Oh good , sublight engines are back online . What about ftl ? [ alarm beeping ] What ? Long range sensors just picked up a ship Headed straight for us . What kind of ship ? Galactic authority . How the hell did they find us ? How do you think ? Somebody must 've sent a subspace transmission And tipped them off . What are our options ? With the ftl drive down , our only option is to fight . Can we take ' em ? I can 't access weapons . We 're locked out . How 's that possible ? It 's been passcode protected . Crack the code ! I don 't think i can . Five , where are you ? Five , we need you on the bridge , come in . Son-of-a-bitch . What 're you going to do ? I 'm gonna go get that passcode . Wait ! What the- - Here we are again . Congratulations . Your pals are on their way . My pals ? The galactic authority . What are you talking about ? We picked them up on our long range scanners . They are headed our way . What ? ! Why do you even bother acting surprised ? Because , you idiot , it wasn 't m . It 's never been me . You may not give a damn about anyone else on this ship , But i know you still have feelings for two , So what do you think is gonna happen When they take the ship , huh ? She 's illegal tech . They 're gonna tear her apart , piece by piece . Can you live with that ? Give us the passcode . Give us a fighting chance . What are you talking about ? What passcode ? [ two ] drop it . I said drop it . So he can torture me for information i don 't have ? I don 't think so . He 's not going to torture you . I won 't let him . Really ? Because it looks like you were about to . Lower your gun . You kill me now or he kills me later . Not much of a choice . [ two ] what are you doing ? [ five ] stopping you from hurting anyone else . [ three ] seriously , kid . She 's the one who poured us the drugged water . She was the last one who saw that shock stick in the vault . [ three ] drop your gun . All this time we 've been wondering why Whoever did this hasn 't brought the android online And taken control of the ship . The answer 's been in front of us all along . There 's only one person wouldn 't need to do that . Somebody who already knows how to control the ship . [ two ] i 'm not the only who knows how to control this ship . No , but you 're the only one capable of overpowering six . Nobody overpowered six , he was surprised by someone he trusted . No , because the truth is , he didn 't trust anyone . Except you . [ five ] all this started when we rescued her from that facili . Something happened to her down there . And when she came back to the ship , The first thing she did was attack our android . [ two ] no . No . No ! [ five ] if you two hadn 't been too busy suspecting each other , You might 've seen it . But she played you both . [ crash ] [ bang ] [ one ] what was that ? [ two ] we 've just been docked . [ two ] we 've got about 40 seconds before they blow the airlock And they 're inside . That buys us enough time to get down into the cargo bay , Break out the big guns , and hold this ship . But we have to trust each other in order to do that . ¶ [ doors slamming ] [ three ] what the hell ? Uh ! [ screams ] [ coughing ] ¶ ¶ ¶ [ doors open ] Ugh ! [ electric shock ] ¶

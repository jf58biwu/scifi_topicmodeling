 Happy Birthday to you ! I hope it 's everything that you wanted . Love Anika . Well what are you waiting for ? Adibosoft . 3D Printer . Instructions . Set up in a spacious area . Do not attempt to fix or modify the printer in any way . Hey Anika ! Where 's Charles at ? I don 't know . He said he didn 't feel like coming . You guys feeling ready ? Yeah ! Charles Narration : Warning ! Use extreme caution when printing any personal photos . The printer is designed to permanently shut down in an attempt to print any life form . Celine : Oh wow ! Charles is going to wish he was here to see this . Let 's take a picture ! Warning ! Your use of the printer will be monitored . Do not produce any illegal drugs , weapons , or counterfeit . Hey Charles , Did you forget about our movie date ? Acrimonious is playing . I haven 't seen you since your birthday last week . Are you OK ? I 'm worried about you . Charles Narration : Caution ! Beta testers have reported " print sickness " , an unhealthy obsession with using the printer . Hot damn , that 's good ! Hey you guys ! Hey ! No Charles ? Where 's he been ? I haven 't been able to get ahold of him . Where 's Brent ? I haven 't seen him . I haven 't seen either of them lately . Charles Narration : Print sickness is dangerous . Quotas are in place for a reason . If you experience any symptoms of print sickness , Stop . Printing . Immediately . Hello ? Anika ! I was just about to call you . Anika : Wow ! That 's an expensive suit . Did you print this ? There 's someone I 'd like you to meet . What ? Wait , what is this ? I thought printing humans was impossible . Not nearly . The feature was deliberately removed from retail . All it took was a few modifications of my own . But you already have me . Why do you need another copy ? You were almost perfect . You really were . But then I started seeing all your flaws . Nobody 's perfect . Besides , she 's just- - What ? A carbon copy of you ? Wrong ! A little tweak to the metadata was all it took . A little younger , more exciting ... more refined taste ... Of course , there can only be one of you in this world . You 're sick ! No ! No ! You 'll never get away with this . They 'll find me ! Anika 2 : No . They 'll have no reason to look for you .

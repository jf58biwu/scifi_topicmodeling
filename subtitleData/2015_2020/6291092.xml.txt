 Woman : We 're not just on the leading edge . We 're leading the charge . Technology and innovation for the future . Renautas . Doing good is good business . [ Distorted ] This is Hero Truther . I 'm here to expose the lies and distortions , to speak for the silenced voices . There 's a war going on . It 's being waged right outside your door . The casualties are our neighbors , friends , and family . We stand on the front lines , yet do nothing to defend them . I remember a hope we once shared that our species was capable of something truly extraordinary . Man : Oh , my God ! [ Crowd gasps ] Do you remember how that story began ? 20 seconds that changed the world . Reporter : ... Miraculously healing in front of the camera . My name is Claire Bennet . This is attempt number ... Experts are calling it rapid cellular degeneration . I guess I 've kind of lost count . Truther : She wasn 't alone . Hundreds were inspired to share their abilities . Evolved humans ... Evos . My name is Oluwole Adeyemi . And that was attempt number one . [ Speaks Arabic ] Okay , keep the camera on me . [ Speaking Mandarin ] [ Speaking Spanish ] Truther : They represented the pinnacle of human potential . We were on the verge of something incredible . And this is my first attempt . Truther : What happened ? Woman : Oh , my God . Donna ? What is it ? Truther : How can humanity , capable of such miracles and wonders , be full of such hatred ? Woman : Protests erupted today ... Truther : Didn 't take long for us to blame them . Man : We 're getting reports ... We fear-mongered and labeled . The Los Angeles Ridge fire ... There was no trial , no judge or jury . But a sentence was passed down just the same . The rioting intensified ... We let fear overcome common sense , passed legislation that violates privacy and dignity . We 're forcing them into hiding ... Woman : Look straight ahead . ... into the shadows , where Evos will become marginalized , dehumanized , jeopardized . We know how this story ends because it 's played out time and time again . Mass murders and genocides . Every time we say never again . Never again ! But here we are ... again . It 's time for all Evos to stand up and declare ourselves . [ Sighs ] Come on , Phoebe . You can do this . [ Grunting , swords clashing ] Phoebe : Quentin , I need you to film something for me . Can 't really right now . I 'm in the middle of beating some ass . So ... not right now . [ Sighs ] I 've waited too long . I need to show you now . Thank you . Quentin : So , you want me to , like , toss this across the room ? Please don 't . Just ... You need to get my shadow , okay ? Yes . I have it . That 's ... yeah ? I have received the instructions . Okay . [ Sighs ] Um ... Remember when I was a kid , and I-I always felt different ... Special ? Yeah , you wanted attention . Yeah . Um , well ... Phoebe . How are you d ... I 'm Phoebe Frady , and that 's attempt number one . Holy shit . You 're an Evo . You 're one of them . My sister is an Evo . How cool is that ? ! That 's amazing ! [ Laughs ] How long did you know you could do this ? Two or ... maybe three years . Two years . Why didn 't you tell me ? I don 't know . I-I mean , I haven 't told anyone . What , that you 're a Shadowmancer ? I just didn 't know how to explain it . I wasn 't lying to you or anything . Yeah . You know you can tell me anything . I know . I know . I just ... I ... Saying out loud is a ... Makes it real . Yeah . Did Mom know ? No . You 're the only person I 've ever told . I wish Mom could see you do this . Do you want to see what else I can do ? [ Distorted ] History 's repeating . A class of people have been targeted , portrayed as monsters . It 's our duty to tell their stories . The truth ... Phoebe 's first day at college . I 'm more excited than she is . [ Laughter ] Yeah . Yeah . You 're fine . Welcome to college . This is gonna be a grand adventure . It 's just college . " It 's just college . " Man , you 're gonna be reading so many fancy books . You 're gonna start using big words for no reason . Then you make , you know , lifetime friends ... Wow , this is amazing . ... make some enemies , or maybe some lovers , like this guy . Right ? Actually , not him . Stop . Don 't . Really ? Don 't do him . I just got here . You can do better than that guy . You know , all of this is coming from someone who did not graduate . I got an online degree . Oh , right . It was just after an extended sabbatical . [ Laughs ] Ooh , welcome . Ooh , it smells like college . What , gross ? Oh , look at that . That is adorable . Okay , and my unpacking job is done . Are you kidding me ? There is so much more to do . Yeah , I mean , look at over here . Your roommate has done quite a bit . You 've got to play catch-up . What is this ? Maybe you should open it . " I must save the paper . " [ Laughs ] I 'm opening it , I 'm opening it . I knew you 've been wanting one . Quentin , this ... This is so nice . You like it ? Yeah . Yeah , I do . Thank you . It 's a hard-core real one . Yeah , it looks serious . Wow . What are you doing ? I 'm turning it on . No , no , no . Do not record me . I 'm not wearing my Spanx . Phoebe : How does it feel to be under the microscope ? Hey , I bought this for you , all right ? This is so you can keep doing your Evo thing . You think I should keep making videos ? Yeah . Absolutely . Your story is incredible . You know , girl loses Mom , gains abilities , starts going to college with the backdrop of a brave new world . It 's Oscar bait . We 're gonna make some cash . Right , so you 're a documentary filmmaker now ? Well , if I got time to fit it into my busy schedule , then yes . All I can do is manipulate light and shadow . You think anyone 's gonna care about that ? It 's badass . There was some dork on " The Tonight Show " who could just heat water up to room temperature . Oh , that is so lame . Yeah , sucked . [ Knock on door ] Hi , um ... Phoebe : Phoebe . That 's amazing . Aly . It 's so good to meet you in person . Um , I need to warn you that textbooks are like Hella expensive . Maybe we can share some . I don 't want to buy them . Um ... Oh . Hi . The weirdo with the camera is my brother Quentin . Okay . Um , hi . Quentin : What 's up ? Wow , and he was just leaving . You 're right . Thank you . You 're ... You 're right . I am just leaving . Yes , out . So , uh ... have fun , be careful , and maybe , uh , really be quiet about the , uh , whole ... Okay , I already told her on Facebook . She 's cool with it , okay ? Oh , yeah , there 's a kid back home who can breathe underwater or something , so it 's no biggie . Oh , it 's no biggie ? See ? So everybody 's cool with fish boy , then ? Yeah , she 's fine . We 're all cool ? All right . Uh , then I will be seeing you , aly . Out you go . Okay , bye . Your brother is kind of adorable . Eh , he 's all right . [ Chuckles ] Okay , uh ... My brother thought that I should make another video , so ... here goes . I 'm Phoebe Frady , and this is my second attempt . It 's freaky , right ? Okay . Are you ready ? Okay , well , let me film it . You 're the one with the power . Come on . True , true . Fair enough . You have to whisper . Professor : All-powerful forces . Okay , the lights ... And Evolution is nothing more than mindless variation . Human genome variation ... [ Class murmurs ] [ Laughter ] [ Phoebe screams ] [ Breathing heavily ] Aly : Hey , hey , hey . Phoebe ? Phoebe ? Phoebe , hey , hey , you 're okay , you 're okay . Okay ? Did it happen again ? [ Sobs ] Okay . Can we leave the lights on again ? Yes . Absolutely . Just give me a second , okay ? [ Gasping ] You okay ? Yeah . Are you sure ? Yeah , I 'm sorry . No , it 's ... Don 't worry , okay ? Sorry . The Dark grew restless and decided it would rule . Seriously , right now ? Quentin : Aly showed me the videos . Why didn 't you tell me you were having the nightmares again ? She told you ? Hey . Don 't be mad at aly . She 's just worried about you . We both are . [ Dish clatters ] It 's just nightmares . It 's not just a nightmare . It 's real . The darkness , I can feel it . Waiting and watching . You don 't get it . Hey , hey , hey . Come on , come on , come on . I 'm not crazy ! I know . Just help me understand . I don 't think you 're crazy . I never said I think you 're crazy . All this shit started happening after Mom 's accident . Right ? What if ... what if we just get you somebody to talk to ? No , I don 't need anyone telling me what 's wrong with me . It wasn 't my fault . I know . We know . I miss Mom . Yeah , I know . [ Crying ] I miss her so much . I miss her , too . Quentin : So , maybe we 'll just take a break on using your power for a little bit ? Yeah . [ Sniffles ] Now can you stop filming every mental breakdown I have ? No way . This is gold . We 're going to Sundance . I 'm getting stronger . It 's like I can steal light , absorb it . Channel the darkness . [ Distorted ] How long before voluntary registration becomes mandatory ? Around the country , schools and workplaces are starting to require genetic testing . This is nothing more than a blatant excuse for discrimination . Every concession we make is another signature on our death warrant . Join the fight . Start the Revolution . [ Indistinct conversations ] This is the best . I 'm so happy this worked out . Aly : So many cute guys showed up . Good job . You would notice that . Oh , what is all this ? Oh , finally . What took you so long ? Hey . Hey . I just thought this was gonna be like a few people . This is crazy . Yeah . Well , we tweeted it out , and everyone started showing up . It 's great . Yeah , now it 's like a full-on protest . Yeah . I thought we talked about taking this easy , Phoebe . This is kind of crazy . The school is trying to deny Evos scholarships . Okay ? That 's total bullshit . Yeah , and genetics should have nothing to do with education . Exactly . Thank you . [ Indistinct shouting ] Crowd : [ Chanting ] No more Evos ! Aly : Who are those guys ? It 's probably a good time to get out of here . [ Chanting continues ] Get that sign out of my face , asshole . - Let 's get out of here . - No , we have to take a stand . [ Indistinct shouting ] Look what this freak did . - Get him off me . - Come on , let 's go . Let 's go . No . This wasn 't supposed to happen ! Everyone stop ! [ Grunts ] [ Murmuring ] [ Siren wailing ] [ Tires screech ] How did you do that ? - I ... I ... - She 's one of them , too . - I didn 't know what else to do . - Let 's get the hell out of here . Come on . No , no , no . Do not arrest her . She 's trying to stop it . She was just trying to help . - Turn the camera off ! - I am documenting this . Woman on P.A. : Registration is for your own safety . Use of abilities is prohibited on our campus . When did you first become aware of your abilities ? 16 . Who do you live with when you 're not at school ? My brother ... Um , my half-brother . Mother deceased . What about your father ? Where 's he ? I don 't know . Why do you need to know all this ? All Evolved humans must be entered into the database . It 's the new federal mandate . Woman : Stand on the line . Eyes right here . [ Camera shutter clicks ] Quentin : Here she comes . What an f 'ing nightmare . Hey . Hey . So , check it out . I am officially an Evolved human . That 's not funny . Did you hear her in there ? National registration ? You 're lucky all you got was an I.D. Card . I know . Did you not see the latest Hero Truther video ? I mean , come on . Look ... Jesus Christ . And military conscription in China . In Russia . You got people going to friggin ' camps and they 're getting sterilized . Oh , sure , but that 's Russia and China , not he ... It could be here in a second ! I told you about Coyote sands . All right , the government has known about Evos since way before Claire Bennet came out . Weren 't you the one who wanted me to make videos in the first place ? I didn 't know you were gonna go around organizing protests . Ah , I 'm sorry . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . You got to be more careful . Can we just go ? Quentin : Internship fats . Internship fair . I 'm hiring interns , also known as a girlfriend . So can a cab . Just gonna take some of these . Phoebe 's gonna love all my B-roll . Uh , that 's really weird . We take about six applicants a semester . Great . Do you have any I.D. ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Thank you . Just give me one minute . Globus bio solutions ? Yeah , I was on their website , and they do some really cool stuff with cell biology . [ Nasally ] Some really cool stuff . I 'm so excited . Sorry , the position has been filled . [ Normal voice ] That 's blatant discrimination . You know that , right ? - Stop . Quentin . - Do you know that ? - Quentin . - I have ... I have you camera . Quentin , it doesn 't matter . It 's fine . Come on . I don 't want to work for those assholes , anyway . Quentin : I got all that on tape . Excuse me . I couldn 't help but overhear what happened . Perhaps I could interest you in a different point of view . Evolved , if you will . - Renautas ? - We 're one of the fastest-growing tech companies in the nation . But we don 't discriminate . In fact , we encourage the hiring of Evolved humans at our newest campus . The future holds many exciting opportunities , and Renautas believes you 're meant to do something extraordinary . Um ... thanks . [ Slowly ] Thanks . Quentin : Good thing that wasn 't creepy . I don 't know . I mean , it sounds kind of cool . You just like him 'cause he looks like blade . Yes , that is it . " Doing good is good business . " Sure . Phoebe : " Quentin 's cooking show , " episode 1 . Oh , we are shooting this ? - Yes , yeah . Everything . - All right . We 're documenting this meal . So , first thing you want is some ... is some fungi . - Oh , right . Yes . - Right here . Yeah . No meal is complete without some fungus . Yeah , absolutely , because it gives it that , like , dirt taste . - Mmm , yum . - Like an old woman 's made the sauce ... - My fave . - ... Which is what you want . Mincing . - Give it a bit of a mince . - Ooh . That is quite the technique . I 'm not gonna get that . I think I 'm probably just gonna use the telephone and order food . - You ready ? You ready ? - Oh , my God , yes . - Okay , yeah . - We 're gonna do this on three . - Okay . - One , two , three . - [ Grunts , laughs ] - Oh ! This is the most dramatic thing I 've ever done . Yeah , um ... So , if I don 't get an internship this summer , I think I want to go to the Odessa Summit . Unbelievable . Come on . This is our chance to show the world that we 're not freaks , that we deserve rights . It 's our chance to prove that we 're meant to do something extraordinary . We 're meant to Usher in the future . I think you should stay here . Focus on your finals . Of course . Of course you do . Weren 't you the one who said that I have to reach out and be part of a movement ? You filmed the whole thing , and now you don 't want me to be there when history is made ? I think it 's a bad idea . Okay ? Especially after what just happened at the rally . This is such bullshit ! Come on ! I 'm trying to protect you ! I don 't need your help ! [ Door slams , electricity crackles , glass shatters ] Jesus Christ ! Not cool ! [ Distorted ] It 's time for all Evos to stand up and declare ourselves . Primatech will open their doors on June 13th for a Three-day summit . Evos everywhere must unite in solidarity . It 's important for us to be in Odessa , standing shoulder to shoulder as one single species . Together we can pave the way towards a brighter future for all mankind . [ Ringing ] Phoebe hasn 't called or texted me back in days . I know that she 's a little pissed , but , uh ... I 'm getting a little worried . [ Ringing continues , click ] Phoebe ? The voice message box is full and cannot take new messages . Goodb ... [ Click ] [ Knock on door ] Quentin : Aly . What ? Aly , where 's Phoebe ? I 'm looking for her . I haven 't heard from her in days . She 's not here . I haven 't seen her . You should have called me . Where 's she been ? I sh ... I didn 't ... I didn 't know . I thought she was at home with you . Look , last I saw her , she was asking to , like , borrow a pair of flats for an interview . For what ? I ... Um , maybe there 's ... I saw a card . Um ... This is ... this is it . This is the company . [ Cellphone vibrates ] Oh , I know this guy . - Oh , shit , shit , shit . - What ? - I 'm getting a call . - [ Cellphone chimes ] Do you know this ? 432 ? Texas ? I don 't . Phoebe : Quentin , I messed up . I just want to come home . I 'm not sure I can do this . Th-they want ... [ Clatter ] [ Ringing ] Come on , come on , come on . [ Busy signal ] Damn it . Aly : Midland , just outside Odessa . - Primatech . - What ? Quentin : Wikipedia Primatech conspiracies . They 've been tracking and capturing Evos for decades . It 's the site of the summit . I 've got a bad feeling about this . - I 'm going . - Wait , I 'm coming with you . This is it . This is it . This is it . - Here , take the camera . - Okay . I 'm gonna go in , talk to this guy . Hey , uh ... You wouldn 't , by chance , have seen this woman ? Uh , this is my sister . She made a call at this pay phone , like yesterday at 3 : 30 . Would you ... Are these like security cameras ? No , I don 't have access to ... Holy shit . - Still , if I have to describe ... - She 's at the Summit . We got to go . We got to go . We got to go , come on . Let 's go . Let 's go . [ Engine turns over ] You can see from our footage , traffic is backed up for miles as people from across the globe pour into Odessa . [ Horn honking ] Come on . Come on . Aly : People are walking . What is this , some kind of parking lot ? Get back in your cars . [ Horn honks ] What the hell are you doing , man ? Get back ... [ Grunts ] - Quentin , this is crazy . - We 're not even moving . We 're just standing still . We 're never gonna make it . Rourke on Radio : Say what you will about the Chinese . At least they know how to handle a situation . - Oh , my God . - ... Evos under control . What do we do ? Typical liberal response . We give them a soapbox to stand on . Here 's why . - It 's Phoebe . - Quentin , where are you going ? - I 'm going . Something 's wrong . - Wait . Wait for me . ... delinquents with delusions of grandeur who 've been handed the genetic equivalent of a loaded weapon . [ Rumble , warble , explosion ] Oh , my God ! Oh , my ... oh , my God . Oh , my God ! What was that ? !

Quentin , please stop the car ! Oh , my God ! Quentin , stop the car ! Man on TV : June 13th will certainly go down in history as one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil . With such widespread destruction and the sheer ... [ Siren wailing ] We 're expecting casualties in the thousands . On this morning of hope , the dream of peace between ... - Hey , hey , hey . Excuse me . Hey , I 'm sorry . I ... - Sir ! Have ... have you admitted someone named Phoebe Frady ? Just please . Come in here . - You need to get back in line . - F-R-A-D-Y . - Quentin ? Quentin ? - Look it up in your computer . - Please , I just need to know . - Quentin , come here ! - Once again ... - Excuse me . ... the FBI has confirmed that radical Evo supremacist leader Dr. Mohinder Suresh has claimed responsibility as the mastermind behind today 's horrific attacks . - Oh , no . - Officials have also released - the names and photos ... - No , no , no , no , no . - ... of 10 persons of interest ... - That 's not possible . ... suspected bombers , who took their own lives carrying out the attack . Remember when I was a kid , and I-I always felt different ... Special ? Quentin : Phoebe . How are you ... My sister is an Evo . How cool is that ? ! [ Laughs ] That 's amazing ! Quentin : I 'm trying to protect you ! - I don 't need your help ! - [ Door slams , electricity crackles , glass shatters ] Man : This act of terrorism is a threat to mankind , to our humanity . Woman : After a unanimous vote , congress is set to ratify the Odessa protocol . [ Distorted ] We let fear overcome common sense , passed legislation that violates privacy . [ Door opens , keypad clacking ] [ Door closes ] Aly : Just a couple more boxes in my car . Harris : The future holds many exciting opportunities . - You gonna help me or what ? - ... Meant to do something extraordinary . - Come on . - You can 't keep doing this to yourself . How many times are you gonna watch these ? There 's got to be something in here , something I missed . Even if there was , Quentin , what are you gonna do with it ? Upload it to Hero Truther . Great . So you and the 10 other shut-ins that scour the site will see it . Maybe it 's time to let her go . You think she did it , don 't you ? I ... I don 't know . Hey , but I heard her screaming every night for a year . - Something was wrong , and you know that . - [ Groans ] She was lost and scared . You know , maybe Suresh got in her head . Suresh had nothing to do with it . She never met Suresh . I have his unpublished book right here . Hero Truther uploaded it . It 's all here . I read all of it . All right ? He was not a radical . He was a humanist . You know , he believed the Evos were nature 's way of ... of safeguarding mankind . So why would he destroy our only hope ? They made him the fall guy . - Who is " they " ? - Renautas ! Check it out . Right ? June 13th was a calculated event to vilify Evos . Renautas brought Phoebe to Odessa for some kind of reason , and Primatech ... well , Renautas and Primatech are connected ... - I just don 't know how ... - Quentin . Quentin ! Look at yourself . This isn 't healthy . Okay , none of this is gonna bring her back . Look , whatever happened , okay , whether she did it or not , Phoebe is gone . Okay ? And we need to move on with our lives . Guess that must be real easy for you , huh ? Um ... Okay , screw you , Quentin . [ Door opens , slams ] They claim that my sister was one of the Odessa attackers . That she murdered thousands . But as you can see from these videos I posted that that is not true . She was innocent . Hero Truther , I need you to help me find some proof . I couldn 't save Phoebe . But I can clear her name . I 'm gonna find out who took her away from me . [ Keyboard clacks ] [ Sniffs ] [ Warbling ] Whoa , whoa ! [ Distorted ] I 'm sorry about your sister . I 've lost more loved ones than I care to count . But we 're at war , and taking on Renautas is a battle we are going to lose . I 'm sorry , I can 't afford the risk . So , what ? So , what ? We 're supposed to give up ? We 're supposed to throw in the towel ? What happened , man ? You were supposed to be exposing the truth . Odessa changed everything . The public 's scared . They 'd rather hunt us down , pick us off one by one , than hear the truth . My sister followed your example , Claire Bennet 's . She stood up , and she declared herself . She believed in you . She trusted you . She wanted to be a hero . But it got her killed . Don 't you let her death be in vain . You owe her . I can get you inside . But after that , it 'll be up to you . Let 's do it . [ Chuckles ] Hello , Mr. Fitzgerald . You look really good . I got this . And then I got a pen . What is this ? This is a camera ? Oh , no way . That 's awesome . Yes . It 's like I 'm James Bond . But where are the Bond women ? It would be a dream come true to work for a venerable company such as Renautas . And did you know ... You know that doing good is also my business ? It 's pretty amazing . Wait , are you kidding ? Of course I will start today . I can 't wait to expose you for what evil bastards you truly are . Woman on P.A. : Orientation tour begins in five minutes . Please proceed to the outh Atrium . Man : So , here at Renautas , we want to foster your creative spirit . Doing good is good business , and we know that happy employees do the best work . So we have catered lunch from noon to 2 : 00 P.M. each day , Taco Tuesdays , and a Sushi chef on Wednesday . We always encourage weekday recreation to stimulate your creativity . So we have Foosball , Table Tennis , and Dodgeball in the summer . We also have brainstorming sessions frequently that occur outside . Sunshine time is a really great and healthy way to get your daily dose of vitamin D. And for stress relief , you can try our afternoon yoga or even take a nap ... I 'm in . Entry level . But I can work my way up , gain the access that we need . [ Knock on door ] - Hey . - Hi . Uh , thank you so much for taking my call . Oh , it 's ... - Come in , come in . - Okay . - [ Chuckles ] - [ Chuckles ] Thanks . Uh ... I just wanted to say that I am sorry . For what I said . Um , me too . You know , you ... you look really good , though . - You look better than ... - Thank you . - ... I did . - Yeah . [ Chuckles ] Yeah , I was getting ... I was getting rough . Uh , you were right . You know , it was time for me to get off my ass , take some initiative , and do something . You know , so I got job . Oh , that 's great . - Where are you working ? - Here . Check this out . Renautas . Oh , my God . I 'm working with Hero Truther . He 's covering my tracks . I just bide my time . I 'm collecting ammunition to take them down . - If they caught you ... - Everybody thinks that Primatech burned down on June 13th , but they are wrong . Not only is there a connection between Renautas and Primatech , but get this ... ba-ba-Da-Da ... Renautas is Primatech . [ Laughing ] Isn 't that nuts ? That gr ... And it 's all here . All of it . All I see is someone sitting alone in the dark , ranting like a crazy person . - No , you don 't ... I ... - Okay , no , when you called me , I was really hoping you had your shit together . - I have my shit together . - But you don 't ! Okay , this is too much , Quentin . Look , you can help us expose them . I ... I don 't want anything to do with this . Okay ? Don 't call me again . [ Door opens , closes ] Here . Look at this . They got a whole team digitizing Primatech 's assets . This is the hard evidence that proves that Renautas is keeping up the same practices as the company . If there 's gonna be a smoking gun , it 's gonna be in there . I can 't bypass their firewalls without leaving myself vulnerable to an attack . You 'll have to copy the files locally . So break into Renautas and hack into the systems ... Like , there . Okay . Where is it ? Where is it ? Username . Password . Okay . ♪ Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo Primatech . Hello , Noah Bennet . Walker System .

I can 't hear you ! - [ Loudly ] Five , six ... - Louder ! ... seven . [ Panting ] I can 't believe that worked . [ Laughs ] Yes ! Yes ! Quentin : This is the Laundromat where Hero Truther told me to meet him . This is the evidence that exonerates my sister , that proves that Renautas was behind June 13th ... That they are bagging and tagging , just like Primatech . Everything has led up to tonight . Tonight ... The Revolution begins . [ Breathes deeply ] Wish me luck . [ Button clicks ] [ Breathes deeply ] [ Bell jingles ] What 's the password ? Quentin : Cockroach . Take the door on the right , down the stairs . [ Door closes ] [ Laughing ] Holy shit . What ... Is this ... I guess this is your rebel hideout , huh ? It 's no hoth , but it 'll do . [ Whoosh ] He 's clean . Let him go , Dahlia . He 's a friend . Whew . Huh . Cool . Uh , I guess you can 't be too careful . - Thank you . - Got a big target on our back . Renautas has managed to manipulate most mainstream media , so we 're the only independent voice left . Quentin : I 've been wondering about that . How has Renautas not shut your website down ? [ Chuckles softly ] Let 's just say I have a skill that keeps us up and running . Oh , you 're an Evo . All right . I 'm just another one of the hunted . But you can call me Micah . Now , I have something I need to show you . It 's about your sister . What ? [ Warble ] Phoebe : [ Crying ] We captured this video two weeks ago . Oh , my God . She 's alive . A comrade of ours escaped a Renautas facility where Phoebe was held . Look , everything that you 've found proves Renautas is planning something big ... Maybe even bigger than June 13th . We 're gonna stop them . We 're assembling a strike team to extract your sister and others . We could use your help . My help ? - We 've been compromised . - He led them right to us . - I didn 't know . - Look ... find Noah Bennet . [ Gunfire ] Too late . [ Taser crackles ] [ Groans ] Go , go , go ! Oh , God , oh , God , oh , God ! Renautas appreciates your help in locating their feeble resistance . - [ Clang ] - What ? Oh , shit ! Go ! [ Panting ] And I 've been on the run ever since . Now it 's up to me to expose the truth . Renautas has both my sister and Hero Truther . So now I 've got to find the one person who can stop them ... Somebody who knows how they operate . Noah Bennet . He went off the grid . They 've been keeping tabs on him . It 's a new name , but it 's definitely him . He walked away from Primatech after June 13th . But does he know Renautas revived the company ? That they are using his methods to find and hunt innocent people ? He was the man with the plan , and I need his help . ♪

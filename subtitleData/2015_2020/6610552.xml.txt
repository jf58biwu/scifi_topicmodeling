There have been small earthquakes . The dome resists and protects us . My father said that 's as if earth tells us that is alive . It 's been three months . I 'm beginning to doubt someone will still come . But we are learning to adapt . We use my father 's diary as a survival guide .

With fear and hope , we begin our journey in search of answers . I do not know if we are really prepared , but we must try . What do you think ? Good . Why are you wearing makeup ? Perhaps we can find men in Barcelona ... Ha ha , that 's funny ... You never lost hope . I didn 't have a father . Your mother died , didn 't she ? Is that why you left England ? My father and I needed start again And my mother was Spanish , so ... yeah . That decision saved my life . Do you think we 'll find someone ? Alba . I don 't care if it 's just me and you forever . Hey . Sorry , it is that ... I didn 't want to embrace my father . The day he left . His hands were dirty and was in a hurry . No , father , your hands are dirty . I didn 't want to hug him . - Maybe you can ... I don 't think we 'll find him . It 's been a long time . It may be that find him . There won 't be many tractors in Barcelona .

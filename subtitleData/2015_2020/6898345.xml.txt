 Oh , God . He 's here . ( BEEPS ) ( GASPS ) Police . OPERATOR : Can I have a name and address ? Kate Olsen , FRSA . 5 Pope Square , Canary Wharf ' . ( SOBS ) I think someone 's coming for me . Keep calm , Miss Olsen . The police are on their way . Could you tell me exactly where in the building you are ? Miss Olsen ? - ( SOBS ) No , please . - Hello ? Miss Olsen ? What are you saying ? Hello ? My head 's beating way too fast for its own good . But I don 't care . Nothing else matters . Nothing can go wrong . Not when the universe around me is so in sync with my every move . And I know with utter certainty that tonight is my night . That with each turn of the cards , spin of the wheel , roll of the dice , my fortunes are gonna change forever . It 's time . Time for everyone who ever doubted me , who belittled me , who despaired at my losses , to bow down at my kingship and glory in my brilliance , as I win it all back . And keep on winning . Amen . HARRY : That 's how every night starts . Come half ten , it 's all gone down the toilet . Believing in good luck is madness . It takes hold of us . That 's why we 're all here . Great speech , Harry . Thank you . Let 's wrap up by saying the steps out loud . - Step one . - GROUP : I have a gambling addiction . Step two . GROUP : I am placing my faith in a higher power than myself . I think this is the dumbest thing you 've ever done , Harry . I 'm aware of that . I won that money on a crooked roulette wheel . You don 't know that for certain . I know that the woman that was with me that night is a criminal . The woman who gave me this . - Then why did she give it to you ? - I don 't know . All I do know is that I 'm alive . I could easily not have been alive . Maybe I shouldn 't be alive . I 'm glad that 's all clear then . The total haul from Lau 's jet is reported to be about ten million ... ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Excuse me one second . How 's the head ? Like it looks . Listen , I gather it was looking pretty grim for me back there before you ... Risked life and limb to save your arse ? - I 'm kidding . - Yeah . Anyway ... thanks for that . Any time . Oh , how 's it going with the two in custody ? Er , yeah , alright . The ... The leader , Nelson , he 's ... he 's keeping shtoom , but the other one is 19 years old . I 'm going to lean on him for the last member of the gang . You ... You nearly had him , didn 't you ? We 'll need a description . They were wearing helmets . I 'd still like to talk them through with you . Winter wants to see us both now . ( CHUCKLES ) Finally , some love from the big man ! RECORDING : Kate Olsen , FRSA . 5 Pope Square , Canary Wharf . I think someone 's coming for me . 999 call , 9 : 24pm last night . Kate Olsen works for the Financial Regulation Security Authority investigating bad traders . There 's been no sign of her since that call . We 're treating this as a murder ? Without a body ? We 're treating it as a high-risk missing person with a significant threat of murder . So am I back as SIO on this ? You charged into a highly explosive situation without any thought , against all our planning and yet your actions saved Orwell 's life and recovered a priceless gemstone . So , while the Grady inquiry progresses , I 've decided to put you on another case . I gather it 's the popular choice . Do I get a reward for finding the diamond ? I was offered a job in a place like this once . As a bonds trader . I bet you were . With a brain like yours , you 'd be minted by now . Nothing unusual here . No sign of any kind of disturbance . But she specified she was in this office when she made the call . We need to find out who else was in the building . Or who followed her in . This building has a pretty impressive security system . You can 't get in without a pass . OFFICER : This is Kate Olsen coming in at 7 : 45 last night . You were in the security room all night ? Yeah . And you 've checked the foyer tapes for Olsen leaving ? She 's not on ' em . There 's no record of Olsen 's pass checking out either . She 's not here now , so how can that happen ? Beats me . Can you check the CCTV on the 15th floor at ... What time did she make the 999 call ? - 9 : 24 . - 9 : 24 . OK . These are all the screens on her corridor . Wait ! We just jumped ten minutes . Rewind . - I don 't understand . - OK . Play . Yeah . See , ten minutes . OK , bring up the CCTV on the underground car park and the emergency stairs at 9 : 24 . We need Forensics to check out her office properly . No , I don 't understand ! Why have you let him come back as SIO ? He saved your life . - He 's a hero to the guys out there . - But we know he 's rotten . Knowing is not the same as proving . I think it 's about time you paid a visit to Lily-Anne Lau . Lily-Anne Lau ? We need a physical record of what went on between Harry and her father . SURI : I keep thinking I 'm seeing Ben everywhere . - Is that weird ? - HARRY : No . I 've tipped off a mate of mine in Vice about the Green Dragon roulette tables . What ? I 'm not letting Lily-Anne Lau get away with this . Hello . Brett Stonewood . Kate Olsen 's boss . In the past few months , Olsen has just been working on one case . If I 'm honest , we 've had concerns about Kate for quite a while now . What do you mean ? Kate 's behavior has been ... erratic . This case had started to consume her . She started chasing foreign leads . Sometimes punching in a week later . The fact she 's missing doesn 't surprise or worry you ? I didn 't say that . Who 's that ? I know him . Vincent Lermontov . Yes , that 's the former CEO of the company Kate was investigating . He died two weeks ago . By jumping off the Needle Building , yes . Why was she investigating them ? Vincent Lermontov was a gold bullion dealer . He bought and sold huge quantities of gold . Kate became convinced that he was too good at it . I 'm guessing she didn 't convince you . We work on evidence and there was none . What does that mean , " too good at it " ? Kate thought that Lermontov 's results were beyond all probability . That basically Vincent Lermontov was just too ... Too lucky ? SURI : Who runs Lermontov International now ? His son , Paul Lermontov . Kate had an appointment to meet him last night . SURI : Just before she went missing ? I only found out about it today . She never told me about it . - ( PHONE BEEPS ) - Oh , sorry . Oh , I 'm sorry . I have to go to this meeting . But you will keep me up to date with this ? Thank you . Sir . Ma 'am . This is the flat of someone with no interests apart from their work . One to use , one to wash . HARRY : Anything ? - She has Type 1 diabetes . - What ? This is an emergency glucagon kit . She needs to maintain her glucose level with carbs or sugar or she 'll lose consciousness . What happens if she doesn 't have it ? She 's in trouble . - Fentanyl ? - Yup . Forensics found tiny traces of it on Olsen 's desk . It 's used as an anesthetic . You can get it on the black market . Someone knocked her out . We went to Olsen 's flat . We found syringes , insulin . We think she 's prone to hypoglycemia . If her glucose level drops when she 's under , the kidnappers have to act fast . Maybe that 's the point . The perfect murder is the murder we can 't prove . All they would have to do is deny her any food , sugar and ... just wait ? If that happened , it 'd be very hard to prove she didn 't die naturally . Can I get on with my job , please ? Hmm ! I thought you did this for fun , Doug . Listen , will you try and make sense of all the chads and figures in Olsen 's files ? I 'll be next door if you need me . Oh , Jesus . " 24th of April , 1986 . " ( RINGS ) Harry ? Get online . I need you to look at something . You 're unbelievable . ( DOG BARKS IN THE DISTANCE ) ( GLASS SHATTERS ) ( SCREAMS ) Mum ! RICH : It looks very , very similar . - Who 's this dude ? - HARRY : He 's a dead dude . Vincent Lermontov , he 's a gold bullion dealer . - Billionaire . - ( WHISPERS ) Look at the dragons . And the extra-long yang line . It 's definitely the same min-yung bracelet . You know what , Harry ? Now that I 'm awake , I 'm 100 per cent sure it 's definitely the same bracelet . - Yeah . Thought so . - ( PHONE BEEPS ) Oh ! I 've got to go . Anna 's on the other line . Bye . Anna . ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( PHONE RINGS ) What have you got ? MAN : You could partially disable the FRSA building from a cable room in the basement , but it 's not easily done . Check the CCTV on the roads out of the Isle of Dogs . We might isolate a vehicle in the same timeframe . Copy that . A young woman says she urgently needs to speak to Harry . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) ( SIGHS ) Thanks for coming by . She 's really worked up . What the hell happened ? She said she saw someone in the street . I don 't know if she saw anyone . Daddy , I saw a scary man looking at me . Come here , come here . It 's alright now . It 's OK . - Daddy 's here . - ( SIGHS ) - Where 's Harry ? - You just missed him . - When will he be back ? - I 'm sure he won 't be long . I work with him . So ... why don 't we start with your name ? Eve . She fell asleep holding my hand . She always used to do that , remember ? You don 't really have to stay . She won 't wake up now . I don 't think it 's safe for you to stay here . I don 't think she saw anyone , Harry . She just misses you . I 'd feel a lot better if I stay here . I 'll sleep in the armchair . Our hero . SURI : How do you know Harry ? I don 't want to talk to you . I need to see Harry . Now . Tell me what the problem is and I can call him . You can 't help me . Look , wait . I can see you 're in some kind of trouble . Let go of me now . Tell him he doesn 't have to believe in me , he just has to believe in it . Time 's run out for me . Who is this Eve ? No idea . Well , she knew who you were . I think I figured out what made Olsen so obsessed with Vincent Lermontov . Oh , yeah ? The price of gold always goes up when something very bad happens . Like Tottenham beating United ? No ! Like wars . Natural disasters . Big stuff . These three dates are when Lermontov made his biggest investments in gold . Read them out . " 21st December , 1979 . " Three days before the Soviets invaded Afghanistan . " 24th April , 1986 . " Chernobyl nuclear disaster . " 10th September , 2001 The day before 9 / 11 . Lermontov bought £ 100 million worth of gold . His biggest ever investment . It was worth eight times as much by the end of the year . Olsen believed that Lermontov knew these things were going to happen ? If she did , then she really was crazy . No one could have known . Let 's go see the son and heir . - Hello . DI Clayton . - Good morning . Please . Follow me . Nice seagull . SURI : It 's an albatross , dummy . BUTLER : Mr Lermontov will be with you shortly . HARRY : Thanks . He has the best view in the best city in the world . LERMONTOV : I do , don 't I ? Shame I can 't appreciate it . My eyes are hypersensitive to light . - Have been since I was a kid . - HARRY : Right . So why live in the tallest building in London with floor-to-ceiling glass ? ( SCOFFS ) This is my father 's flat . - Your father died recently , didn 't he ? - On his 70th birthday . He went up those stairs . climbed onto a balcony and jumped . Did you know my father , Detective Clayton ? - No , I didn 't . - Really ? I thought you must have met him . We 're here about Kate Olsen . She went missing two nights ago . Really ? You met with her that night . What did she want to talk to you about ? Kate Olsen was obsessed with my father and his business to an almost pathological degree . She wanted to speak to me about the same thing that she always did . Probability . The probability that my father couldn 't be this successful . - Maybe she was right . - People like Olsen didn 't understand - that the harder my father worked ... - ( PHONE RINGS ) ... the luckier he got . Excuse me . Hello . Just give me a second . That 's a remarkable bracelet you 're wearing , Detective . It 's Tang Dynasty , isn 't it ? Um ... So I 've been told . And where did you get such an incredible piece ? A bloke down Romford Market . - ( CHUCKLES ) - Your father had so much . Why do you think he felt the need to kill himself ? That 's the thing about luck , Harry . It always balances out in the end . Anna , hi . It 's me again . I 'm just trying to make sure everything 's OK . - Erm ... I 'll try again later . OK , bye . - Everything OK ? Daisy thinks she saw a man outside the house last night . What have you got ? We tracked this from a road out of the Isle of Dogs . Check the time . 9 : 42 . Eight minutes after the blackout . - Is the SUV registered to an address ? - Canal boat on Regent 's Canal . ( GLASS SMASHES ) ( EVE GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) This is it . I can 't see anyone inside . - We have no warrant . - We have no time . Kate ? Kate ? Close those . Kate ? Kate ? Hand and leg ties.Cut. She was here . Jesus . - What does insulin smell like ? - Like Band-Aids . - I don 't know what that is . - ( EXHALES ) Have a look through there . Anything ? ( BANGING ) What the hell is that ? There 's someone on the roof . ( LIGHTER CLICKS ) What the hell ? Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Jesus ! We 're on fire ! Check the windows . She 's locked us in . SURI : Oh , no ! Harry , do something ! ( GRUNTS ) Harry ! ( COUGHS ) ( GRUNTS ) Suri . Suri , come on . Come on . We need to get you out of here now . I 've got you . Come on . Come on . I 've got you . ( GRUNTS ) ( COUGHS ) That 's it . Here , breathe . Breathe . ( SIRENS WAIL IN THE DISTANCE ) OK . CROUPIER : Raise to 2,000 . What exactly are you and your boss asking me for , Detective Orwell ? We 're asking for your cooperation . That is sweet . But I think you 're asking for a little more than that . If such a document existed , showing the financial relations between my father and Harry Clayton , and I 'm not saying it does ... how can you guarantee it won 't be used against me ? It would only be used as evidence in an internal investigation into Clayton . - Nothing more . - I have your word on that ? Yes . There 's no question of my father 's murder investigation being opened again ? No . Hm . Food for thought . I 'll have to see what I can find . Oh , hi , Anna . I 'm just heading out . - It 's a very quick question . - Sure . - How did we get Kevin 's Grey 's case ? - What do you mean ? I 'm wondering who paid for us to take him on . Why does it matter ? It 's closed now . I expect Grey paid for it himself . I wouldn 't have thought he could afford us by himself . I 'll have a look and get back to you on it . - If it 's that important . - Thank you , Nathan . - ( CLEARS THROAT ) - SOCOs are at the boat now . - Not that there 's much left of it . - ( COUGHS ) - Are you OK ? - Hmm . For a moment there I ... I thought that was it , eh ? Olsen found something out about Lermontov that 's worth killing for . Well , what , though ? ( VIBRATES ) Sodium thiopental . What ? The syringe you bagged at the canal contains sodium thiopental which has a variety of anesthetic uses . But Forensics thinks the concentration in the syringe is similar to that used by the Soviets as truth serum . Soviets ? They were interrogating her . - So we know they 've kept her alive . - Until they find out what she knows . We 're dealing with a different operator . Someone with serious military training . ( SIGHS ) ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Hiya . I just wanted to make sure that Daisy was OK . She 's at my mum 's . You shouldn 't be here on your own . Well , you better come in then . I spent the whole day worrying , thinking that I should have been there last night when Daisy got scared . - You were . - Yeah , but ... I mean , I should have been here with you , protecting my family . I think I 'm doing a pretty good job of that myself , thank you very much . You are , but you know what I mean . - Can we start all over again ? - ( LAUGHS ) Seriously . I 'm serious ! We can get it all back . - How ? - I can get it all back . - I promise . - ( SCOFFS ) You were always shod on self-belief . HARRY : True . It 's why I fell in love with you in the first place . Yeah . You should probably go . - Yeah , five minutes . - Yeah . What are you hiding , Kate ? ( BEEPS ) ( PHONE BEEPS ) ( SIGHS ) I 've got to go back to work . OK . But ... When I am done , I 'll ... I 'll come straight back and we can spend some proper time together . Harry , Haw- - What do you think just happened ? What do you mean ? Do you think everything 's OK again between us ? Well , yeah . I mean ... What , because we went to bed together ? Well , why did you ? Because I was lonely . Yeah , well , me too . That means we can move on . Nothing 's changed . We still have to move out of this house on Monday . You 're still a gambler who could still lose everything that Daisy and I have had for ourselves . You said you had to go . ( DOOR SHUTS ) " I met an old man in Kirov who swears he knew Vincent Lermontov before he became Vincent Lermontov . " " Vincent Lermontov is actually Vincent Zolin , a railway worker and hired hand for the Kirov mob . " " He killed a notorious Moscow KGB boss when he was 23 . " " 9th of April . " " Went to see Brett Stonewood at the Landor Hotel . " " He told me my new information about Vincent Lermontov was false . " " He advised me strongly to take it no further . " " Stonewood brought a new FRSA agent to our meeting . " " Tall . Bald . Russian accent . " ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) I heard rumors that you 'd given up gambling . That 's true . I have . 800 . Then you must be the ghost of Harry Clayton . Winning very big today . Gambling 's for losers . That 's why I 've given up . Can you beat a flush ? MAN : I 've often heard it said . Once you stop caring , then you can really start winning . ( TEXT ALERT ) Harry ! Your money ! Burn it ! Stonewood was actively trying to get her off the Lermontov case ? SURI : Yes , but she kept going regardless . So then he tried to intimidate her by bringing in a new FRSA agent . Some tall , bald Russian guy . - Oh , Jesus . Where are you new ' ? - Just outside the FRSA . I 'm going in . - Wait for me . I 'm nearly there . - There 's no time . - Suri , I said wait for me . - That 's all I 've been doing . - ( HANGS UP ) - Suri ? Jesus . You lied to us . I told you everything you needed to know . No . You withheld what Olsen found out about Lermontov . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Police ! Kate Olsen 's crazy theories have no bearing on this at all . It 's why she was taken away ! You 've known it all along ! That is a very serious accusation to lay at a senior FRSA officer , DS Chohan ! Excuse me . What are you ... ? - Where is she ? - What ? Kate Olsen is about to die . - You are an accessory to her murder . - No ! Who was the Russian bald man you took to that last meeting with Olsen ? - Huh ? - I don 't know . - I was never told . - He wasn 't an FRSA officer , was he ? - ( YELLS ) Was he ? - No . - Where is she ? - I don 't know ! I promise ! But you told him about Olsen 's hypoglycemia ? Explained all they had to was to deny her sugar and she would die naturally . Then when they dumped her , it would look like poor mad Kate Olsen had a tragic accident ! You have no evidence I did anything untoward ! You 're under arrest . Suri , grab his things . ORWELL : I think Lau 's going to help us . Did she give you the impression this record existed between Harry and Freddie Lau ? Yeah , she hinted that this was just the start of what she has on Clayton . I think this goes back a long way . WINTER : Where 's Clayton ? He 's questioning Brett Stonewood in Interview One . I uncovered some files showing he was complicit in Olsen 's abduction . Olsen was so paranoid , she encrypted all the intel she gathered on Lermontov . I managed to decode some . She certainly held plenty of information to indict Lermontov . Stonewood then handed Olsen to him on a plate when she wouldn 't drop the case . Anything else on Olsen 's whereabouts ? They 're interrogating her somewhere , trying to find out everything she knows . Our only hope is they won 't let her die until they 're sure they have everything . Dead or alive , she 's probably out of the country . Border controls have been on high alert since the 999 calls . They 'd have to smuggle her out another way . Shipping containers . Lermontov has a shipping company called Albatross International Freight . Based at Canary docks . Services freight to Russia and the Balkan states . That 's where Olsen is . Get Clayton . Get over there . I 'll son the warrants . ( SIREN WAILS ) Harry , how the hell are we going to find her in here ? We can 't just drive around like this . She 's here somewhere . I know it . Yeah , but where ? ORWELL OVER RADIO : Harry . Come in , Harry . Come on , come on . Where are you ? Harry , we need to interview all the crane drivers . - We haven 't got time . - Well , then what 's your plan ? I 'm placing my faith in a higher power . Great . So you have no plan . Come on , come on . Christ , where is she ? That 's it ! I have a visual . Stick with me . ( SIRENS WAIL ) Orwell , get her down ! Kate , can you hear me ? She 's alive . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) ( GROANS ) Jesus . What the hell ? Eve ? ( RUSSIAN ACCENT ) She 's alive . Just . Imagine my surprise . I spent last three weeks looking for you all over town . So why don 't you introduce yourself , seeing as you 've spent so much time trying to meet me ? Who I am does not matter . What really matters is who are you ? And why are you wearing that bracelet ? Detective . Father . Ex-husband . Brother . ( CHUCKLES ) Compulsive gambler . And there was I hoping you had the wrong man . But you are wrong man . ( CHUCKLES ) She should never have given that to you . It is why she has to die . - It 's all her fault . - ( SHOUTS ) No ! Eve , Eve ... ( COUGHS ) You know so little about bracelet , Harry . I cannot kill her before I kill you . Tell him why . Tell him ! He won 't understand . ( GRUNTS ) - Tell him . - Tell me ! Eve , tell me . I 'm the only one who can remove the bracelet . RUSSIAN : Mmm . Yeah . You see , it 's too late for me to just chop your hand off . ( EVE COUGHS ) Because the bracelet is joined to him now . Isn 't that right , Eve ? You 're making a mistake . That 's not the real bracelet . RUSSIAN : I thought you would say that . This is why we are going to test it out now . Vincent used to play this a lot . ( sum CLICKS ) ( GASPS ) But then ... Vincent really was one hell of a lucky man . ( CLICKS ) ( WHIMPERS ) ( LAUGHS ) Anyone can beat just one bullet . Well , keep going , Kojak , or don 't you have the balls ? Oh , I have balls , but you have ming-yun bracelet . It 's a cheap piece of tat ! It doesn 't mean anything ! Then what do you think saved you at racetrack , huh ? And at river ? Let 's face it , Harry , before you got bracelet you weren 't very lucky man . I don 't feel very lucky now ! Vincent used to be a penniless worker on Siberian railway . But then one night he accepted a contract to kill one of most dangerous men in Moscow . But even Vincent didn 't realize that his ultimate reward would be Eve 's mother coming to visit him with that very same bracelet . You have no idea what you 're playing with , Becker , which is why you are going to burn in hell . ( CLICKS ) BECKER : Hmm . 50-50 . This is where it gets interesting . Believe in it . ( sum COCKS ) - PAUL : That 's the thing about luck . - DAISY : Daddy , Daddy ... ( OVERLAPPING VOICES )

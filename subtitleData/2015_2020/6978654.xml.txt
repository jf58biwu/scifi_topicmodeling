 Previously on " The 100 " ... In the name of king roan , Polis is now under Azgeda rule . The reason Alie created the city of light , nuclear reactors inside power plants that survived the bombs are melting down . If we can 't figure out a way to fix it , all of us will be dead in 6 months . There are a thousand ice nation warriors on the street who want to kill us today . They won 't kill us . How could you possibly know that ? Roan , we need your help . Something 's coming . Our ancestors survived praimfaya . Not this time , not without us . I , king roan of Azgeda , let it be known that an attack against Skaikru is an attack against us all . We 'll do our best to keep the king on his throne . We 'll find a way to beat the radiation . If either of you screw this up , we die . Ok , Princess . What now ? Now we survive . No . No . No ! Do it . She 'll break . No ! No . Put the knife to your own throat . No . Ohh ... Clarke , don 't . No . Yaah ! You are a terrible influence . Roan is expecting me . Abby ... Jake 's a part of who you are . Go . The king need you ... But be careful . The tower 's safe enough , but we 're on dangerous ground here . Welcome to your throne room , my king . Now that the lift has been repaired , I 've doubled the guard on the doors at every floor . Expecting trouble ? I trust only Azgeda . Your mother taught me that . Our people loved her for it . Our people feared her , echo . Because she was fierce and vicious . My mother 's ambition , her disregard for Lexa 's alliance got her killed . If I may , why do you insist on ruling as Lexa did when it 's not what 's best for our people ? At least tell me there 's a reason . Forgive the intrusion , your highness . May we have a word ... Privately ? You can wait like the other ambassadors . Echo , leave us ... Please . We were right to be concerned about Trishanakru . Rafel is gonna challenge you for control . Bold move for a new ambassador . So ? Let him come . With respect , you 're still recovering . The law says you could pick someone to fight in your place . No . The clans will never accept a leader who hides behind the law or another warrior 's blood . You 'll lose . Lexa kicked your ass without a bullet hole in your chest . We should cancel the gathering or delay until you 're strong enough . No . Letting the ambassadors have a voice keeps the peace here . Azgeda holds this city through force alone , and the flame won 't keep the clans at bay forever . If they unite against us , we could lose , and if we lose ... They come for Skaikru . And the radiation comes for us all . No one has to die . The point of our arrangement is to give us time to find a solution to save everyone . And how is that solution coming ? We 're working on it . In the meantime , I 'm here to keep you in power . Let me talk to the ambassador . Go ahead . Talk ... But ... If you fail , I 'll have no choice but to fight . We 've been at this for two days . There must be something we 're not thinking of . What if we could reach the nearest nuclear reactor ? I told you , the meltdown started months ago . There 's no magic button to turn them off . Today this isn 't black rain , but it will be soon . That 's why we have to focus on riding out the radiation , finding someplace safe and big enough to hold all 500 of us . This isn 't just about saving us . I made a promise to roan . It 's about saving everyone . And that 's why we need to tell everyone . Crowdsource it . If there 's another mount weather out there , the grounders will know about it . And you think they 're just gonna tell us just like that ? If we tell everybody they 're gonna die , the coalition is over , roan falls , and the grounders will be at our gate . Then just tell our people . We need more minds on this problem . On the ark , people volunteered for the culling because they were told the truth and given a choice ... A choice your dad died for . You think I 've forgotten that ? Ok . We 'll tell everybody the truth as soon as we have a viable solution . Without one , it 'll start a panic . - You don 't know that . - That 's it . What are you talking about ? Think . Alpha station survived for 97 years in space through elevated radiation levels and extreme temperature fluctuations . Sound familiar ? All we have to do is patch up the ship . We 're standing in our viable solution . Heh . Raven says we can get it sealed up in a month . - The ark is our ark . - I get it . Ok , so freeze-dried meat until we can grow our own food . We got oxygen scrubbers , but how do we store enough water for 500 people ? We don 't . That 's why we 're heading to farm station . Why the hell would we do that ? It 's in the damn ice nation . You just said it . We need a hydro-generator , and farm station has one for the crops . Think you can get us there ? No way . Find another machine . Look . There are no others , and without it , we won 't last a year inside this ship , let alone 5 . Fine . I 'm in . Bryan stays here . His leg 's still healing . I 'm in , too . Good . We roll in an hour . You don 't have to do this . Actually , yeah , I do . Since Octavia murdered pike , I 'm the only one left who knows where it is . Why are you defending him ? Pike was a dictator . He was an elected chancellor , and if you don 't care about that , he kept me alive for 3 months . Then why did you help us turn him over to the grounders ? To save you , Nate . Sorry . Nice cap . You know you 're wasting our drinking water , right ? You know we 're all gonna die in 6 months , right ? Not if we find what we 're looking for today . Oh , please . Tell me about another pointless task Clarke has roped you into or , better yet , don 't . I don 't want to keep any more of her secrets . We 're going back to farm station . Why don 't you come with us ? Monty ... Look at me . I 'm really trying not to . I 'm fine , all right ? I 'm having fun . Jasper ... I 'm not gonna kill myself ... What 's the point ? But you know what ? If you want to cheer me up , while you 're at farm station , get that weed we stashed behind the wall of your old bedroom . Huh ? Don 't leave me hanging , man . Just ... Yes . Music to my ears . Hey , you want a hug ? Hey , uh , blueprint for the hydro-generator , and don 't forget , it 's filled with hydrazine that combines with oxygen to make water , so go slow . Or the hydrazine could go boom . I know . Raven , I got this . Don 't you have a ship to fix ? Battery 's full . If we 're lucky , we won 't have to stop to recharge . If we 're even luckier , roan 's seal will work the way it 's supposed to . If you get in trouble , just show this . Got it . Thanks . Load up . You can still come with us . No . I can 't . Arkadia is just plan " B. " It doesn 't help the grounders . I 'm not stopping until we have a solution that saves everyone . We save who we can save today . All right . Let 's go . Uh ! Uh ! This is as close as we can get . From here , we go on foot . We get the machine and get out of here . I don 't want to stay here any longer than we have to . Guys , got a problem . The barn isn 't empty . They moved in . If it 's the same guys who attacked us , with our guns , we could take them . I 'm sure we could , but we didn 't come here to fight . They butchered us , killed kids , our friends , our families . I don 't like it any more than you do , but Bellamy 's right . We need that machine . Uh , guys ? Weapons down . Now . Now ! Bryan , now . Ok . It 's just ... Uh ! Where did you get this ? King roan . Skaikru and Azgeda are allies . He sent us to get a part of the ship , a machine . Look . If we 'd come to take this place back , there 'd be a lot more of us , and you know that . Where is this machine for the king ? We 've got a lot of work to do to get the ship ready for winter . Sector 4 ... The crack in the outer wall , we need to patch it up . Start by repairing the damaged panels . Sector 5 ... we need to get that tree out of the hole and seal it up . Any questions ? Ok . Go . You ok ? There is so much to do , and I get a total of 5 volunteers to help me fix the ship ? That 's a start . I can 't run this repair alone , Clarke , even if I had complete mobility , even if Sinclair was still alive . Who ... who the hell am I giving them orders ? I 'm ... I 'm not the chief . I 'm not the chancellor , but here we are . For what it 's worth , there 's nobody I trust more to do this than you . As soon as Bellamy gets back with that machine , we go public with everything and get you the help that you need . Am I interrupting ? What do you want ? I was an engineer before I was chancellor . I supervised the redesign of sector 5 . And how many people died from sector 5 in the culling when you sucked the air out of their lungs ? 42 . Would you like to know their names ? Raven , wait . We could use the help . You do know he made me cut my wrist to force your mom to take the chip , right ? He was chipped , too . He searched for the city of light . He bought Alie here . He showed her how to overcome free will . Yes . Those are my sins ... And I have to live with them . Raven ... You want to help ? Go sort the scrap . Whatever you need . Ever meet a grounder who could power up a spaceship ? Do what you came to do . No . Up there , the generator . Let 's go . Riley ? Riley ... Bryan , wait . We thought you were dead . Only the machine . The rest is ours . Come on . Ah ! Huh ! Agh ... Agh ... Let me take a look . You 're healing , but you need more time . I don 't have time . Rrgh ... Oh ! Uh ! I would be honored to take your place in this fight . I will not run from this challenge . Echo 's right . I didn 't save your life so that you could tear yourself apart again . Since when are you two on the same side ? And if you can 't help me , why the hell are you still here ? This fight can still be avoided . Protecting Skaikru gives the other clans an excuse to challenge you . Let me take care of the problem . Let me do what your mother would have done . Then please just tell me , what did Wanheda offer ? What deal is worth losing the faith of your people ? Chance to survive the end of the world . That 's what they 're offering to all of us . Soon , praimfaya will once again destroy everything . Skaikru 's trying to stop it . My king , they 're lying to you . They 'd say anything to save themselves . Let me prove it to you . Send me to Arkadia . Your only concern now should be helping me win . Once I do , you may go to Arkadia , prove my trust in Wanheda 's deserved . Ambassador , may we speak privately ? We know you plan to challenge king roan . I 'd like to ask you to reconsider . Ask ? After everything your people have done , you expect diplomacy ? Skaikru 's not your enemy . Skaikru made me murder my entire family . I have no one left . I 'm sorry for your loss , but the chip technology , it affected all of us , every clan . You blame Skaikru for the city of light . Shouldn 't you also credit us for destroying it ? After everything we 've suffered , why spill more blood ? The clans are stronger together . Heh . You see , Ilian ? The king can 't fight , or his minions wouldn 't be here trying to stop us . If the king wasn 't hurt , do you think this coward would give a crap about your family ? Since you landed here , your people have done nothing but rip our world apart . Rafel , I urge you ... You reap what you sow , ambassador . The time of Skaikru is over . Well , that went well . Oh , there 's too many people . Damn it ! Hey ... Can we talk ? Sure . I got about 6 months , no waiting . What 's up ? I 'm trying to make sure that we have more than 6 months , which is why these people need to get back to work . I didn 't force them to stop . I guess they think it 's the end of the day , not , you know , the end of days . Don 't you want us to survive , Jasper ? No . I don 't want us to survive . I want us to live . If we don 't repair that ship , none of us will have that chance . And what about free will ? That 's why you destroyed Alie , right ? Why don 't you tell them all the truth ? Keep your voice down . Should let them decide what they want to do with their last 6 months . What are you so afraid of ? We can 't just go to them with no solutions . - People will panic . - Ah , I see . Hmm . That 's spoken like the council that sent a hundred kids to die on the ground . Hmm . I don 't care that we 're unarmed . We can 't just leave them . We 're in the coalition now , so we ask the king to free them . That 's our best bet . Not if it means leaving Riley . No . We won 't , ok , but Harper 's right . We try diplomacy first . If that doesn 't work , we come back with reinforcements for the slaves after we take home the machine , right ? Yeah . They 're moving them . Hey , it 's now or never . Are there any other exits in here ? No . This is completely sealed . Came down from space in here because it 's the most secure room in the ship . It 's designed that way in case the hydrazine blew . What ? We have a bomb . Wait a second . The end of the world is coming , and you want to destroy the one thing that 'll keep our people alive ? Yeah . Not all of our people . What about Riley ? I vote that we take it home . No . Blow it up . I 'm with Bryan . I know what it 's like to be locked up and afraid . You didn 't leave us in mount weather . We shouldn 't leave them here . Can we build another machine ? No way . The tech 's too advanced . We have 6 months . We have raven . Are you telling me she can 't figure out another way to make water ? Yes . Look . I know you want to make up for the things you 've done ... Believe me , we all do ... But we need to think of the big picture ... 25 people instead of 500 . We 're talking about the human race , Bellamy . We need to get this machine back to Arkadia . It 's the only way . It 's two to two , your call , Bellamy . What 's it gonna be ? - Watch it , Miller . - Wait . Wait . Wait . Just set it down here . Now ! - Bryan , come on ! - Run ! Move ! Move ! - Uh ! - Uh ! - Uh ! - Rrgh ! Ok , Nate . This isn 't your kill . This isn 't your kill . Uh ! This is Monty 's kill . What are you talking about ? This is the man that murdered your father . Uhh ... You don 't have to do this . Yeah . I do . Hrah ! Huh ! Huh ! Rrgh ... Rrgh ... Aah ! Aah ! Get off ! Aah ! Aah ! Get off ! Get off ! Aah ! Raven ? Raven , you here ? Polyethylene silicone elastomers . We don 't need that for a winter storm or to protect us from a grounder attack . What are we really bracing Alpha station for ? Heavy lies the crown . I know the burden of keeping a secret you think is going to destroy your people . You locked me up . You floated my father . And now you understand why . No leader starts out wanting to lie or imprison or execute their people . The decisions you face just whittle you down piece by piece . So what do I do ? I 'll tell you what I told your mother after the culling . We make the best decisions that we can with the information that we have , then hope that there 's a forgiving god . Can roan fight ? It 's too soon . One simple task , and I 'm failing . No . You 'll figure it out . Hmm . What 's wrong ? There 's nothing more that I can do for roan . Ah . You need to go back to Arkadia , to Clarke . Your necklace . What the hell do you want ? I 'm here to ask you one last time to back down . Hmm , you trying to frighten me , little girl ? If your problem really is with Skaikru , not roan , then challenge me instead . We can settle this . Ha ha ! You 're not worth my blade . I came here to change your mind . Hmm . You can 't . Trishanakru will have its justice . Now leave before I ... Long live the king . Roan , please , it 's not too late to cancel . You failed . We do this Azgeda 's way . Take your seat , ambassador . Where is Rafel kom Trishanakru ? The ambassador was found dead this morning . His heart stopped . Let us begin . You gonna kill me , too ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I honor Lexa kom Trikru . We are stronger together . Hey , Bry ... We ok ? Just tell me you think saving these people was worth it . I wish I could . - Hey ... - I can 't . I can 't . I 'm sorry . Bryan ... Uh ! Riley ? Clarke . Riley ... I can 't believe you 're alive . I am now . Get Riley and the others to medbay and tell them we 'll take them to their villages in the morning . Where is it ? We didn 't get the machine . It didn 't survive landing ? No . It did , but I had a choice ... Bring the machine home or use it to save them . Oh , we are so screwed . We have time , but I am not sacrificing any more innocent lives . You just did . I made the call , and I 'll live with that . Yeah . You 're not the only one who has to live with your call , as usual . Well , go tell them . Go tell Riley I should 've left them to die . Ok . How many of us will the ship sustain without a hydro-generator ? No more than a hundred . What am I supposed to tell the people now ? The truth . Crowdsource it like we talked about . Call for a general meeting . What are you gonna do ? Hope that there 's a forgiving god . So now you know the truth . I know you 're afraid . I know you 're angry , but when I shut down Alie , I knew there was a way for us to get through this together . Alpha station is that way . Every single one of us will survive on this ship . It won 't be easy . Raven needs volunteers if we 're gonna get it ready in time . It 'll be a lot of work , but now you understand why we need to do it . If we stick together , I give you my word , we won 't just survive . We 'll thrive . Nice speech . Sometimes hope is more important than truth . You dad would be so proud . You wanted workers . You got them . Everyone to the hangar bay . Now . We save who we can save today .

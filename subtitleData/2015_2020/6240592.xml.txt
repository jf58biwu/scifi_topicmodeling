 Previously on " wayward pines " ... Theresa , there 's been an accident . I want whatever 's left of the car transferred here . We 're taking over the investigation . I don 't know where ethan is . That is the truth . Ethan burke for adam hassler . Marcy : He 's not available at the moment . If there 's time , i want to call it off . But it 's done , adam . [ grunts ] Help ! I need a doctor ! What happened ? The truck exploded . People are gonna want to hear from you . What does it matter what i think ? Ben , you survived a terrorist attack . You 're a hero now . Give me a reading on ruby 's chip . She 's at home in bed . She must have taken her chip out last night And left it in her room . I wonder how many more people are home in bed . What happened at the fence ? Two got away , four got taken , and kate 's in jail . Ethan : Your husband blew up a truck Last night on main street . Nearly killed my son . I 'm so sorry , ethan . Something must have gone wrong with the timer . It was - - it was meant to go off a-at the fence . Alan : I say we just keep driving till we hit san francisco . This time tomorrow , We 'll be drinking beers by the bay , man . I can 't . Come on ! All right ! [ laughs ] we made it ! [ laughs ] [ snarls ] [ screeches ] [ telephone rings ] [ telephones ringing ] [ cheers and applause ] Kill her ! Yeah ! [ indistinct shouting ] [ applause ] Woman : Kill her ! Is this what you want ? [ indistinct shouting ] Do it ! Do it ! Is this really what you want ? ! [ snarling ] [ hisses ] [ munching ] [ sniffs ] [ sniffing ] [ snarling ] [ screeches ] [ snarling ] [ screeches ] Hey ! [ knock on door ] Where 'd you go ? You said you were gonna bring us some food ! God . I can 't take another minute of this . I 'm gonna lose it , i swear . Franklin ! Stop . You 're making everybody nervous . Well , shouldn 't we be ? Where the hell is harold and the rest of them ? Uh , thankfully , not in here . Maybe they actually made it out . Or maybe they 're dead just like us . We 're not dead . Well , we 're as good as . The only reason we 're not is because the sheriff 's busy . If he wasn 't busy , he 'd probably drag us Right out onto main street , slit our throats , wouldn 't he ? Ethan is not pope . He 's not gonna do that . Yeah , you 're probably right . He 'll probably just shoot us . Franklin ! You add to that the fact That we just about killed his little kid , You think this guy 's gonna let us live ? Yeah . Yeah , i-i do . What makes you so sure ? Because i know him . No , you don 't . You knew him . The guy you knew is gone . Now he works for wayward pines . He 's just a patsy , working like everybody else , Taking orders , collecting a paycheck . No . No , no , no , no , no . We 're dead . We 're dead . Yeah . Excuse me . Excuse me . You cannot go in there . We 're looking for the sheriff . [ door closes ] yeah , well , he 's not in right now . Well , where is he ? Well , it 's none of your business . Oh , i think it is . Class one of the academy . Well , congratulations . It 's a real honor . It 's not an honor . It 's a responsibility . See , we take the rules of this town seriously , Unlike your boss . Excuse me , but ethan burke Takes the rules of the town very seriously . Then why is he sheltering terrorists ? I thought blowing up kids was against the rules . Wouldn 't you say so , sean ? They put amy in the hospital . I 'd say that 's against the rules . And if you break the rules , you have to be reckoned . That 's the sheriff 's duty . What the sheriff does and doesn 't do Is none of your damn business . See , that 's where you 're wrong . The future of this town is in our hands , not yours . And not your sheriff 's . So , you tell him - - If he doesn 't do what he needs to do , If he doesn 't reckon those traitors soon , Someone 's gonna do it for him . I will tell him no such thing . Now you skedaddle , Or i 'm having the three of you locked up . Do you hear me ? " skedaddle " ? You really want to put us in a cell with those traitors ? Get the hell out of here . Did you hear me ? I said get the hell out of here . Come on , jason . Let 's go . Let 's go . You tell him . [ door closes ] [ indistinct conversations ] Ethan . We got this under control . Under control ? They 've breached the perimeter . We 're fortunate to still be alive . You have to stop this now . I will . [ sighs ] I 've got harold in custody . I 'll get him to talk and find out where the others are . Yes , you said that before . They put your son in the hospital , And now - - now this ? This happened because they didn 't know What was really out there , because you didn 't tell them . No . No , this happened Because what you 're doing isn 't working anymore . The people of wayward pines Are familiar with a certain way of life , A way of life where people who break the rules Are punished . They 're gonna demand retribution , release . And if you deny them that , Then they 're gonna take the law into their own hands . More deaths will follow . You have to act decisively and swiftly to stop all this . This group - - they 're weak . They 're reckless . Why have they taken so long to do all this ? Why ? Because they 're doing what their leader told them . Without kate ballinger , they 're nothing . Reckon her , and you could stop all this . Look - - I told you i need to do things my way . If you could have killed the easter bomber Before he acted , would you ? Don 't make the same mistake twice . Don 't wait till it 's too late . Just consider - - One life to save wayward pines . [ grunting ] Sit down , harold . I want to see my wife . We 're gonna have a little chat first . I 'm not talking till i see kate . What , are you gonna call your lawyer ? Come on . Sit down . You know , i think it 's strange , you being so worried about kate When she 's all cozy in a cell . Alan ... That 's the one i 'd be worried about . What happened to alan ? Well , he made it past the fence . He made it ? Yeah . About 50 yards . And here 's eric . Or maybe that 's alan and that 's eric . It 's hard to tell . What did you do to them ? Does it look like i did this ? Harold , if i want to kill somebody , i 'm gonna shoot them . I 'm not gonna eat them . That fence that your friends tried to destroy - - It 's there for a reason - - Because there are things beyond it , Things a lot worse than me . That 's a lie . You 're lying . Then what do you think that is ? You think that 's a leg , or you think that 's an arm ? Look , you don 't have to believe me . I 'm either a-a psychopathic cannibal , Or maybe - - what - - maybe i 'm telling the truth . Any way you slice it , I don 't see where you have much of a choice . I need names of everyone in your group . And what happened here to your friends Is gonna happen to every single person in this town ... Including you and your wife . Do you understand ? Do you understand me ? Uh-huh . Names . [ sighs ] Nurse pam : Theresa ? How 's he doing ? He 's - - he 's good . He slept through the night . Oh , that 's so good . That 's really good . And how is amy doing ? Oh , she should be going home soon . She was very lucky . Yeah . Let 's face it - - they both were , hmm ? Yeah . Theresa , i don 't want to frighten you , But i think you deserve to know . There 's been another attack . Someone drove a truck through the fence . Two died . Where 's ethan ? Oh , no , he 's fine . He 's fine . He - - he was lucky , as well . [ sighs ] Theresa ... I know that ethan has shared with you What 's at stake here . Mm-hmm ? Mm-hmm . Do you believe him ? I don 't know what to believe anymore . Good . That 's good . It 's very important to question things , hmm ? Especially right now , when things are so ... Broken . Why don 't you go home , get some rest , hmm ? We 'll take care of ben . Oh , and i wouldn 't take main street for right now . It 's not safe . Take boxwood home instead , hmm ? See what you find . Okay . [ elevator bell dings ] Ethan : Pilcher . I need to find these people . Easy enough . Harold broke ? He gave me 14 names . We 're gonna need some help tracking them down . Of course . Shouldn 't be hard . They 're all together . Where are they ? Biergarten . [ chuckles ] bring it up . They 're not there . [ dialing ] [ ringing ] [ telephone ringing ] Biergarten . They took out their chips . They 're off the grid . [ beep ] Man : Any available neurologist to e.R. 2 . Any neurologist to e.R. 2 . Man : 302b ? Woman : All right , hang on . Woman : Dr. Roya , 6-8-7 . Dr. Roya , 6-8-7 . G.C.S. Her levels are dropping rapidly . Let me see that . Go ahead and intubate . All right , she 's right at 9 . [ sobbing ] [ indistinct conversations ] What happened ? [ monitor beeping ] Amy ? Amy ! Ben , ben , no , you can 't come in here . But what happened ? You can 't come in here right now . She 's had a swelling in her brain . What ? ! We have to perform a surgery . Ben , you cannot go in there . Please . No , she was in my - - she was fine ! I know . I know . She was lucid not long ago , But she 's had an epidural hemorrhage , sweetheart , okay ? We 're doing everything we can . You 've got to trust us , ben . Please trust us . [ sobs ] [ voice breaking ] oh , sweet boy . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . Start by concentrating on the perimeter . We have to prioritize the fence . This is gonna take forever . We 've got over 5,000 cameras . Yeah , well , what if there 's a blind spot ? We 're gonna find them . [ computer beeps ] Oh . [ drawer opens , closes ] [ clattering ] Megan : Ben . Has there been any more news ? They won 't know anything for a couple hours . Oh , ben . Ben , you must take comfort In the fact that you are not alone in this . There 's great strength in unity . It will carry us through any storm , No matter how fierce . [ rhythmic clapping ] [ clapping continues ] You told them ? About amy ? Of course . They deserve to know . We 're all in this together . Ben , have you thought any more About our conversation yesterday ? [ voice breaking ] i-i don 't know . Everyone wants to hear from you , ben . They need to . This town , it 's coming apart . I 'm sure you heard . There was another attack Last night . Yes , on the fence this time . But still there has been no reckoning . You remember - - as the first generation of this town , You are a leader now . Not me . And not your father . [ clapping continues ] Hey , you guys might want to take a look at this . [ computer beeps ] There 's something going on at the hospital . Young man : Ben ! [ indistinct talking ] Where 's amy ? Where is she ? [ crowd murmuring ] Let him talk . Sound . Ben : I know that you 're all worried . I am , too . Amy 's in surgery right now , and ... They won 't know anything for a couple more hours . But i-i saw you all , and i just wanted to say that ... I 'm glad you 're all here . A-amy 's a good person . And - - and what those people did to her was wrong . They broke the rules of our town , And those rules exist for a reason - - 'cause without them , We 're all in danger . I just heard about another attack . [ crowd murmuring ] I just wanted to say that i-i 'm sorry that all this happened . And i 'm sorry that my dad failed this town . [ sighs ] Well , when is your dad gonna reckon them ? He 's right . Yeah . He 's not going to . Why ? [ crowd murmuring ] [ grunts ] Ethan . Ethan ! [ tires squeal ] [ engine revs ] [ tires screech ] [ vehicle doors close ] Aah ! Franklin : Arlene ?

We are just here to protect wayward pines , To protect our future . So please ... Give me the keys . [ spits ] [ grunts ] Come here ! Arlene : No ! [ both grunting ] Come here ! Come here ! No ! No . You 're making this harder than it has to be , arlene . Please ! Don 't you dare touch them ! Or what ? Your sheriff will throw us in a cell ? Maybe give us a hug ? I know what he won 't do - - reckon us . You 're jason , right ? Jason higgins . I know you . I-i remember you . You bought a toy soldier from us . Harold - - he - - he carved that . You must have been 8 , 10 at the time . But i remember it so well . I remember because you were such a good kid . [ bullets thudding ] I don 't know what lies they 've told you since then , But what i can tell you is , What you 're about to do , you will never recover from . You can stop this right now . It 's not too late . Sean : She 's right , jason . We 've made our point . This isn 't about making a point , sean . This is survival . Are you not paying attention in class ?

[ high-pitched whistling ] [ distorted gunshot ] [ distorted gunshot ] [ sobbing ] [ gunshot ] Ethan : Drop ' em ! Down on the ground . Down ! Arlene ? [ whimpering ] Arlene ? [ door closes ] [ sighs ] Kate . Kate . I need you to talk Or more people are gonna die . Do you understand that ? [ sighs ] And not just your friends . Innocent people , kate . Children . They don 't think amy 's gonna make it . Mm . [ sniffles ] But nobody else has to die . [ sighs ] Here . Please , tell me where these people are . I 'm not gonna kill them . You know that . But i can 't promise you that somebody else won 't . If i have them here in custody , then i can protect them . Just like you protected harold ? If you really want to protect them , You have to stop protecting me . I can 't do that . You have to . There 's more jasons out there . They breed them in this town . They 're not gonna just stop . And i ... [ sniffles ] I can 't have anybody else die because of me . I 'm done . You have to put an end to this . You have to do what pilcher wants . There 's no other way . If i did what pilcher wants ... You 'd be dead already . Someone 's gonna kill me . I 'd rather it be you . [ thud ] I heard something . I think they 're here again . Theresa . What are you doing here ? There 's something i have to show you . I think kate should see this , too . [ footsteps approaching ] Where do these tunnels lead ? I don 't know . What 's this ? Theresa : You 're not gonna believe this . It 's adam hassler . [ static ] [ breathing heavily ] Adam ? He was in on it . This is adam hassler . It 's september 15 , 14 : 20 . [ breathing heavily ] Finally - - Finally reached the city . Oh , my god . Still no signs of any survivors . It 's just abbies . They 've been tracking us . I think it 's - - I think it 's the same group from before . Somehow they seem to be communicating with each other . I 'm gonna try to - - Try to make it to the other side , Join up with the others . Man : Hey , hassler ! Aah ! [ static ] [ mouse clicks ] And adam was just leading one group . There are hundreds of these video journals From cities all over the country , and ... And there 's nothing left . [ sighs ] Believe me now ? Why ? Why wouldn 't he tell us ? Because pilcher 's a control freak . We have to tell everybody the truth . They have to see this . How do you think we can do that Without pilcher finding out ? Let me worry about pilcher . You just think about getting people down here to see this , As many people as you can before midnight . Midnight ? Why ? What - - what 's happening at midnight ? There 's gonna be a reckoning . [ computers beeping ] [ sighs ] We did reduce the swelling . That 's about all we can do for now . Just have to ... Wait and see . [ telephone rings ] Yeah ? Uh , sir , it 's ethan . He 'd like to see you . Where ? Here . Ethan ? I want to reckon kate . Right decision . No . It 's the only decision . When you kill a snake , you got to cut off its head . Kate 's their leader . She brought this on herself . You know , this is your mess . I 'll take care of kate . But after tonight , no more . That 's all i want - - An end to the violence , a new beginning . Well , i 'm gonna need everybody there . Everybody . [ telephone rings ] [ telephones ringing ] [ cheers and applause ] Yeah ! Kill her ! Is this what you want ? Is this really what you want ? ! [ indistinct shouting ] Do it ! I 'm not gonna kill kate . I 'm not here to kill anyone . I 'm here to tell you the truth 'cause we 're running out of time . You 've been lied to ... About this place and about how you got here . And there 's one man behind it all . You know him as dr . Jenkins . [ crowd murmuring ] that 's right - - dr . Jenkins . But his real name is david pilcher . And he hides behind all those cameras . Victor : Sir ? It 's ethan . He 'd like to see you . Well , i 'm gonna need everybody there . Everybody . He created this prison you live in . He watches everything you do . He tells you what job you can hold , Who you can marry , And when someone has to die . He uses fear and violence to control you Because he 's afraid that if you know the truth That you 'll self-destruct , you 'll turn on each other . But can 't you see ? That 's what 's already happening . The world we knew is gone . It no longer exists . You don 't have to like it , but you have to accept it . This town is all that 's left . [ crowd murmuring ] He 's telling the truth . The only reason i 've been fighting Is to find out what 's out there . And now i know . I 've seen it , And it 's the last thing i wanted . I wanted everything we left to still be there , but it 's not . He 's not lying to you , and we can prove it . Woman : You are lying ! She 's not . He 's telling the truth . I saw it , too . So have i . So have i . So have i . Man : So have i ! Kate : David pilcher - - He doesn 't believe we can handle this . But we 're stronger than he thinks . Even with all these lies , with this violence , We have made lives here . How dare you say his name , kate ? How dare you ? And this truth - - it will only make us stronger . We can build a future here because we have to . Why are we listening to her ? David pilcher is a great man . David pilcher is the savior of all humankind ! He chose us , every one of us , And that is a great honor . We owe him our lives ... Our trust , and our devotion . We 're gonna listen to her ? ! She tried to murder two innocent children ! That is not true . She tried to destroy our fence , destroy our town . She is a terrorist , And she has to be reckoned . Enough . [ crowd murmurs ] What 's the matter with everyone ? Why are you all just standing there ? [ crowd gasping , murmuring ] What happened to the power ? [ key clacks ] [ screeching ]

 [ electronic beeping ] All right , guys , we 're ready to fire . Be careful , you 've only got one shot . Don 't worry , Pidge , I 'm an excellent shot . - You are ? - Yes ! That 's my thing ! - Since when ? - Just get ready . [ breathing heavily ] [ screaming ] Pidge ! [ grunting ] - [ clanging ] - [ grunts ] Nice catch . [ Pidge ] This seems like an awfully large place to hold only one prisoner . [ Shiro ] Let 's hope this Slav guy is as good as the Blade of Marmora said he is . [ whirring ] Beginning phase two of the plan . I 'm blocking the sensors . Lance , you 've only got four doboshes to scan the base and land your lion before they 're back online . Copy that . [ beeping ] [ Lance ] Initializing sonic scan now . [ grunts ] [ roars ] Sonic scan complete . Uploading the data . Perfect . We 're right on top of your entry point . Get to my location . Hurry , you 've got 60 ticks . On my way . [ Shiro ] Okay , phase two complete . Welcome to Beta Traz . More ! Give me more ! [ grunting ] [ groans ] Why have you stopped ? My Lord , Haggar ordered us to limit your- - [ screams ] [ groans ] Remember who your master is . Now , give me more ! I 've compiled the data from the Blue Lion 's sonic scan and created this map . It appears the prison is comprised of three concentric levels . Each level is showing different types of security . That 's weird . The Blade of Marmora said this prison was made just for Slav , but I 'm showing two cells . Who else would be held here ? I 'm guessing a space ninja . Or maybe someone with magical powers ? You know , just spit-balling here . I don 't know . Let 's just keep tossing out ideas . - Can you get a visual on the cells ? - No , not from here . And even if I could , we don 't know what Slav looks like . Then we 're just going to have to check both . Dibs on the closer one ! What ? My legs are tired . [ sighs ] I 'll go to the command center to try and access the security system . Let 's get moving . [ screaming ] [ screaming continues , intensifies ] Already , your mind is rendering me weapons and genetic modifications . - [ panting , screaming ] - It must be eating you up . Your brain turned against you and those who would oppose Zarkon . - [ screaming continues ] - [ machine whirring , hissing ] [ sobbing ] Ow ! [ screaming ] - That 's enough for one day . - [ sighs ] You 're not the only one that needs my special attention . With your mind , the Galra Empire will be unstoppable . - [ Pidge ] I 'm in . - Guide us through . It looks like the top level is patrolled by the sentries . The second level is patrolled by floating drones . - Oh , wow , that 's interesting . - Good interesting ? The second level also has immobilizing foam . - Oh , so bad interesting . - And the third level ? Closed system . I can 't get in from here . [ Shiro ] You can 't get in from the command center ? No single location can access the entire prison . It 's a security measure . When you reach that level , you 'll have to link me in . We 're on our way down . Okay . [ to herself ] While you do that ... I 'll find you , Matt . How are we going to get by this guy ? Good teamwork on that one . Uh-oh , we 're spotted . No , no , no , that 's mine ! He 's going to be your escort through this hallway . He 'll scramble the monitors . Shiro , you go left . Lance , go right . [ Shiro ] Affirmative . Okay , open the panel next to you . Connect your gauntlet so I can hack in . [ dings ] Now , I have access to level three . Opening the entrances . Huh ? Pidge , you have any idea how I 'm gonna get through these giant doors ? Lance , be quiet . Someone 's coming . [ panting , grunting ] Okay , but seriously , those are some heavy-duty doors . Don 't play innocent . I know what you did . [ suspenseful music playing ] All right , I made it to the cell . Open the doors , Pidge . Uh , I can 't from here . The door over here scanned that guy 's face . Oh , facial recognition . Shiro , hold tight . Lance , you 're gonna need to get a scan of his face . - Copy that . - Copy that . [ growling ] I 'll be back soon . [ inhales deeply , sighs ] Face on the way , Pidge . Creating 3D render . Sending to you . Are you Slav ? Are you here to torture me ? No , I 'm here to save you . I 'm a Paladin of Voltron . Oh , no , even worse . In 98 and 3 / 100ths of a percent of realities with a prison break , I die ! And your chances are even worse ! [ rumbling ] [ grunting ] Mm-hm . Mm ... hm . [ crunching , growling ] [ shrieks ] Are you- - ? [ clears throat ] Are you Slav ? [ suspenseful music playing ] Yup . Don 't worry , Slav . I 'm here to rescue you . I 'm with Voltron . Do you know Voltron ? Yup . Great . Then you know what the Blue Lion is . Yup . - Pidge , I 've got Slav . - Pidge , I 've got Slav . - What ? - I said I have Slav . No , I have Slav . Wait , hold on . - Tell me the truth . Are you Slav ? - Yup . We don 't have time for this . You 're just gonna have to bring both of them back . Okay . Give us the route out of here . - Yeah , we 're ready to go , too . - Yup . - [ Lance ] Hello ? - [ Shiro ] Pidge ! [ Shiro ] Lance , looks like we 're on our own . We 've gotta get back to Pidge . Wait , what ? I have no idea where I 'm going . - Slav , do you know how to get back ? - Yup . What am I talking about ? Of course , you do . You 're a genius . - Come on . We 've got to hurry . - No , thanks . What ? We 're finally going to stop Zarkon . We have the Olkari and the Blade of Marmora on our side . But , without you , we can 't do it . Mm . I can have you on the Blue Lion and gone in no time , but we must hurry ! Oh , the Blue Lion . Why didn 't you say so ? Blue light has a frequency between 606 to 608 terahertz . Is that gonna jam their scanners or something ? No , that 's just my lucky range of terahertz . Let 's go ! [ to himself ] Okay , uh , more to the left . Mm ... This needs to be right . Um ... Oh , but not too right . - Oh , come on ! - [ yelps ] Oh ! Now , I gotta start over . Sir , Laika has escaped . Oh , no ! Guard this station . Come on , get outta here . Are you sure you know where you 're going ? Yup . [ growls ] - [ growling ] - Whoa ! You 're really savage ! No wonder the Marmorites think you 're so awesome . That 's what I 'm calling the Blade of Marmora . " Marmorites . " - [ chuckles ] That sound good ? - Yup . - Great minds . - Yup . Perfect ! Okay , now , there 's a two percent chance this mission won 't result in a horrific , deadly fireball . Let 's leave ! - [ panting ] - [ screams ] - Let 's go back ! - [ growls ] - Just take the blanket with you . - What ? No , the blanket 's perfect . Don 't touch the blanket ! It 's that ! [ screams ] That 's a tiny puddle . You 'll be fine . There 's a 12 percent chance I could slip . There are even realities in which I drown because , in those realities , I never learned to swim ! What about this reality ? Did you learn to swim in this one ? I can 't remember ! There are infinite possibilities ! It 's a tiny puddle ! I can already feel myself not being able to breathe . My lungs are filling with water . How did you escape ? I 'll find you , my pet . Pidge is the hacker of our group . - Shiro 's our awesome leader . - Yup . Hunk 's our mechanic . He 's also a chef and just a pretty cool dude to hang out with . Yup . And Keith is always doing things like flying into asteroid fields and black holes and cool junk like that . Yup . And I thought I was the team 's sharpshooter , but I guess no one else thinks that . Maybe I don 't have a thing . Yup . You don 't have to agree with me so quickly . They wouldn 't keep me on the team if I didn 't contribute in some way , would they ? - Yup . - Maybe you 're right . Maybe I 'm just a fifth wheel . Seventh if you count Coran and Allura . That 's a horrible wheel to be . Yup . You 're so strong . Must be that robot arm . But doesn 't it bother you that you only have one ? - [ screams ] - Oh , what ? What ? Look at all those cracks ! I can 't step on those . I was carrying you ! Oh , I guess no one cares about their mothers ' backs anymore ! Wait , you know that nursery rhyme ? Nursery rhyme ? I 'm talking about quantum realities here . Cracks initiate space-time temporal fissures , which mathematically make higher probabilities for alternate realities in which your mother has a broken back . [ sighs ] Is there a different route we can take ? One without cracks ? Well , sure , we could go out the scree duct , but , you know , it 's all full of scree . Ugh ! There 's the vlaxenator , but you can hear the water dripping in there . - And you 're worried about drowning . - Now , you 're getting it ! [ Shiro ] Pidge , are you there ? We need an alternate route . Pidge ? Okay , sorry about that . I 'm back . I 'll find you a new route , Shiro . - Yeah , can you tell me where I am ? - Just a sec . Pulling it up now . [ suspenseful music playing ] [ suspenseful music playing ] How about I cover your eyes and carry you across ? - I 'll know . - [ growls ] Let 's just give it a try . [ whimpering ] [ Slav screams ] No screaming ! I was screaming ? Uh , I don 't see an alternate route , Shiro . - [ rapid beeping ] - [ gasps ] - Lance , look out ! - Quick , somebody 's coming . What are you doing ? - Are you trying to get us caught ? - Yup . I 've found you . Stay away from my friend ! There 's your kidnapper . Put the prison on lockdown ! [ alarm blaring ] Huh ? - [ grunting ] - [ Lance screaming ] Pidge , you 've gotta shut off this foam for me ! On it ! Huh ? Matt ? - [ Lance ] Pidge ! - [ yelps ] Sorry ! Just reversing the targeting system , and ... - [ giggling on computer ] - This ought to slow him down . [ grunting ] What ? No ! Stick around ! Huh ? Huh ? - [ doors opening ] - Huh ? Uh-oh . [ groans ] Come back here ! Find out where they 're headed ! Lock down all exits ! - We 've got to go ! - [ screaming ] [ growls ] My friends are in trouble . We have to go now ! We are walking over those cracks . It 's our only option . Why don 't we just turn the gravity off and float over them instead ? Honestly , that 's our best shot of getting out of here in one piece . I ran the numbers . Pidge , any chance you can turn the gravity off ? Oh , that 's a great idea ! Then the sentries won 't be able to maneuver , but we have our jetpacks . It 's genius ! [ whirring ] [ grunting ] [ grunting ] That robot arm is fantastic ! Now , imagine if you had two . Our chances of survival would go up 300 percent from totally doomed to highly unlikely . Oh , wow , you have Laika . The warden will not be happy about that . - Who 's Laika ? - She 's the warden 's pet yupper . - Wait , what ? [ gasps ] You 're an animal ? - Yup . Oh , I see where the confusion was for you . Gravity 's back online in three , two , one . I 'm headed for the hangar . [ all ] Uh ... - [ screaming ] - Get to the lion ! [ screaming ] [ grunts ] I had him ! Let 's go . Slav ! Be right with you ! - Slav ! - [ screaming ] [ grunts ] You steal my yupper and my prisoner ? [ grunting ] Okay , I 'm ready- - What is that ? You 're not going anywhere . And neither is the lion . - [ both scream ] - [ growling ] [ both scream ] [ panting ] [ grunts ] [ groans ] See what I was saying about those robot arms ? [ grunting ] [ grunts , screams ] Lance ! No ! [ screaming ] [ groaning ] [ grunting ] - [ groaning ] - [ grunting , yelling ] [ grunting ] - [ screams ] - [ grunting ] [ both screaming ] [ gasps , grunts ] - [ alarm blaring ] - [ gasps ] [ grunting ] [ all grunting ] [ grunting ] [ screaming ] [ screaming ] - No ! - Wait , I got this . Come on ... [ takes deep breath ] [ screaming ] - [ screams ] - [ screaming ] [ screaming ] Nice , Lance ! That 's why we bring our sharpshooter . Yup . At least , you 're okay . That 's a good girl . Yes , you are . Who 's a good little yupper ? Who 's the good little yupper ? [ Lance groans ] The information I found on my brother says he was taken by a group of rebels . He 's still out there . Matt 's a lot like you . He 's a survivor . We 'll find him . [ groans ] [ groaning ] [ Haggar ] Sire , I believe there 's a spy in our ranks . Our communications may be compromised . None of that matters . Once the Black Lion is recaptured , no one will stand against me . Have you made any further progress with my armor ? None of the tests have been successful . Each time , the subject was killed . I need it ready . If your beasts will not defeat Voltron for me , I will do it myself .

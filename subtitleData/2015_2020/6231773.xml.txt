 Previously on " wayward pines " ... This fake little town is all that 's left . There 's a faction . They 're gonna take down the fence . Surrender your arms and explosives by tomorrow morning And everything stays between us . Wayward pines needs a new generation . You and ben look so nice together . How is that working out ? It 's great , actually . You were right . They got to ethan . We execute tonight . Ethan : All right . Who 's that ? Nurse pam : Ted laufer . He drives the delivery truck . He 's always right on time , right at 8 : 00 . Okay , let 's go . Help ! I need a doctor ! Help ! Come here . Come here . I need a doctor . Sir , we can help . Woman : You 're okay . Come with us , please . [ indistinct conversation ] What happened ? Truck exploded . Prep radiology , now ! Oh , my god ! Wait a minute . Is this guy a real doctor ? Of course he is . We need to move ! Ben will receive the best possible care . You know the children are our most precious resource . Man : Pam to icu , please . [ indistinct conversation ] [ monitor beeping ] Nurse pam : Try to remain calm . Go ahead and look . There you go . Hey . Oh , my god . [ gasps ] [ sniffles ] ah , here 's dr . Carol . So far , i see no significant injury to his brain , But we won 't know exactly where we stand Until he regains consciousness . But he 's gonna be okay . If he comes to in the next 24 hours , The odds of a full recovery are very good . It could be a long night . Try to get some rest . What kind of person sets off a bomb in the middle of town ? I told him to stay home . Ethan : Hey . I did . It 's not your fault . He 's just a kid . He 's 14 . Remember what you were like ? Do you think he 's involved with any of this ? No . [ sighs ] If you need anything at all , You just press this buzzer , all right ? Thank you . Oh , dr . Jenkins ! How are the children ? Amy breslow 's gonna be all right , All things considered . Ben burke is still unconscious . But not to worry - - dr . Carol is with him . He 's absolutely going to pull through . How have they been able to do this ? ! Settle yourself down , now . Remember where you are for god 's sake , david . W-we 'll put out an issue of the chronicle . We explain this is a - - It 's a - - an explosion . It 's a gas leak . Yes . It 's a fine idea . I just hope they buy it . I 'm worried about the townsfolk . And people have already started talking . I think we should do something for them , Something very , very special , for the entire community . A celebration ? Yes . Yes , a celebration of life in wayward pines . Remind everybody exactly how blessed we actually are . Hmm ? [ sniffs ] This is internal bleeding . It 's bad . We should keep moving . No . No . No , we have to stay here And wait for the others . No one 's coming , harold . We don 't know that . And he is not gonna survive another move . [ man whistles ] Here they come . Thank god . [ breathing heavily ] I got some food , water , and first aid in there . Wait . What 's ruby doing ? She had to go back . She can 't risk showing up late for work . What happened to eric ? He got pinned between the truck and the dumpster . Well , we should take him down to the hospital . So they can execute him ? What happened at the fence ? Two got away , four got taken , and kate 's in jail . Oh , my god . Look . I really want to help you guys , but i can 't stay . Sorry . Kate : [ distorted ] i want to get out of this town ! Why ? Because none of it 's real . It 's a - - it 's a potemkin village . They have them in - - in syria , north korea . They 're fake cities built to impress . [ sobs , mumbles ] Who 's behind it ? Cia ? Is it social or - - or medical ? What ? This government experiment . Is it social or medical ? It 's just a town . [ crying ] just a town . With an electrified fence ? W-w-w-with a microchip in my leg ? ! You have to write that down , huh ? I 'm just noting your progress . I 'm not making any progress . I don 't want to make any progress . I want to talk to someone in charge now ! It 's been two months ! I - - i am sorry . [ door closes ] [ door opens , closes ] Oh , poor katie . Not feeling so well , eh ? Don 't worry . We 'll get you all fixed up . [ sobs ] That 's a good girl . [ whimpers ] Oh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . [ gasps ] [ breathing heavily ] [ indistinct conversations ] woman : Ruby 's here , you guys . Heard the driver and two kids are still in the hospital . Henrietta : If that was the gas line , Then how come the asphalt wasn 't damaged ? Only thing exploded was the truck . Had to be a bomb . What do you think , dr . Jenkins ? Well ... When a disaster like this occurs In a town as beautiful as ours , It 's natural for folks to ask questions . But ... We should be careful not to spread rumors . [ telephone ringing ] Hello ? Who is it , ruby ? A fellowship gathering , mandatory attendance . [ people murmuring ] Give me a reading on ruby 's chip . She was late to work . Pine needles in her hair . She 's at home in bed . Let me see . [ scoffs ] She must have taken her chip out last night And left it in her room . I wonder how many more people are home in bed . Ethan : All right , where are they , kate ? Five of your people are Off the grid right now , including harold . You think i want to help you find my husband ? Your husband blew up a truck last night on main street . He nearly killed my son . Ben ? W-what are you talking about ? I-is he gonna be okay ? Don 't even say his name . Just tell me where they are . I am so sorry , ethan . Something must have gone wrong with the timer . It was - - it was meant to go off at - - at the fence . Well , that 's the last thing that we need to have happen . You know what the difference is between you and me ? I believe what i know in my heart . You believe what they tell you . Look , i know you don 't get it . I know you think they got to me . But i know what 's out there and it 's not boise . You ever think about why they picked you to be sheriff ? 'cause i have . You know , i 'm gonna take you up there So you can see it with your own eyes , But we don 't have time with that now . See what ? The monsters ? Where are they ? ! You know , you have really good instincts , ethan . But when push comes to shove , you will always follow orders . You have made the same mistake before . Well ... I 'm not following orders this time . I 'm just trying to make sure that nobody gets killed . What happened to you ? We were partners ? Don 't you trust me at all ? These people want to be free . And i owe them that chance . Amy is holding steady , And ben burke looks like he 'll pull through . Ruby 's one of them . Ruby ? Have you , uh , notified ethan burke She needs to be locked up ? We need to put our own house in order first . I 'm not following . We have 24 people manning surveillance around the clock . Yet , somehow , these insurgents Are managing to meet in secret and build bombs . Someone must be helping them . [ sighs ] David , everyone up here is family , Loyal to you to a fault . Someone 's betraying us and we need to find out who it is . If it will help you to feel better , I 'll conduct a full security review . Yes , it would help me feel better . Man : Snipers have checked the north quadrant . All clear . You still happy with your decision to join us here ? It 's an absolute privilege to be here . Indeed . Indeed . And working surveillance , Is it ever uncomfortable for you ? Do you ever feel like you 're - - I don 't know - - invading people 's privacy ? Uh , it 's the job . I mean , we do it to protect them , right ? Absolutely . Absolutely . How 's reggie ? Very good . And the kids ? Full of energy , as always . [ chuckles ] Oh , super good . How about your post at surveillance ? You enjoying that ? I like it a lot . But sometimes you might want to - - i don 't know - - Avert your eyes or maybe even wipe video 'cause of something you 've seen , erase it . Are you kidding ? Oh , i-i love it when they let something juicy slip . [ laughter ] very good . Super . Thank you so much , gina . Can you send the next person in ? Sure . [ monitor beeping ] [ inhales sharply ] Sweetie ? [ groans ] Ben . Sweetie . Hi . How are you feeling ? Water ? Oh , yes . Yeah . There you go , sweetie . Don 't lift your head . You have no idea how happy It makes me to see you open your eyes . Your dad and i were so scared . Where - - where 's amy ? She 's here in the hospital . Is she okay ? Yeah , s-she 's fine . She was asking about you . Can you go check ? Yeah , sure , i will . I love you so much . [ indistinct conversation ] [ gasps ] [ sighs ] How are you feeling ? Oh , okay , i guess . [ sighs ] Oh , ben . Oh . Everyone in town has been so worried about you . I 'm so relieved you 're all right . Yeah , me too . Oh , it 's just terrible what 's happened . [ sighs ] sometimes , the choices one makes Can lead to consequences we don 't intend . I never should have snuck out with amy . Oh , no , no . No , i 'm not talking about that . We want you to grow your relationships here . I 'm talking about decisions made By the sheriff in pursuing the case . He 's a good man , ben . He 's well-intentioned . And i 'm sure he had his reasons for letting harold ballinger go . Oh , i just hope his judgment wasn 't clouded By the fact that harold 's wife is an old friend of his . Kate and your father are friends , right ? Yeah , sort of . He arrested harold and then he let him go . And then ... I guess i just don 't agree with that kind of leniency . I believe , as david pilcher believes , In a philosophy that i like to call clear and severe . Clear laws and severe punishments . Clear and severe . To be honest , I think your father and i disagree on this issue . But you 're gonna have to give it some thought . People are gonna want to hear from you . What is the proper punishment For speech or actions that harm wayward pines ? Leniency or clear and severe . You - - you say that people Are gonna want to hear what i have to say . What does it matter what i think ? Ben , you survived a terrorist attack . You 're a hero now . How long you think we 're gonna survive out here ? We 'll think of something . Mm , good . That 's what people always say when they 're at the end . Hey . Don 't fall apart on me . We 'll think of something . Eric . Hey . [ grunting ] I 'm not doing this by myself . Not here . Why do you mean ? I 'm not gonna let him rot For all eternity inside this prison . What are you talking about ? We 're not burying him here . We 're burying him in free soil On the other side of that fence . How you gonna do that ? Nurse pam : You ever feel uncomfortable Working surveillance ? Thoughts , feelings , concerns about invasion of privacy ? Oh , no , no , i-i think , um , Our methods are well reasoned and , um , necessary For the continued ... Preservation of human life . [ chuckling ] reggie , You don 't have to quote the manual here , hmm ? Well , in that case , um ... Sometimes . Um , a little bit . It must be strange Peering into people 's lives all day long like that . Oh , no . I-i-it 's not that . I-i-i know we 're here to protect them . It 's just ... Sometimes , people say , Uh , personal stuff . Like what ? Maybe they ask certain questions . Like , uh , " what 's outside the fence ? " Or " who 's watching the cameras ? " And you 're telling me you don 't record those infractions ? Look , i-if it 's just innocent , then ... Then sometimes , i 'll blur the tape Or , i 'll , uh - - i 'll erase a spot . But i just - - i just don 't want anyone To get in trouble for just asking questions . These people are scared , you know ? I-i see them sobbing in their rooms , Holding each other . They just don 't understand what became of their lives . It 's just human nature to ask questions . Yeah . Yeah , absolutely . Human nature . Thank you so much for coming in , reggie . No problem . [ door opens , closes ] This is a bad idea . The construction crew was finished for the day . Besides , who cares ? If i 'm gonna die , i 'm gonna die trying . [ carnival music playing ] It 's a wonderful gathering , don 't you think ? Hmm . It 's nice , bringing everyone together like this . This would make a perfect target , wouldn 't it ? Whole town together in one place . [ country music playing ] [ indistinct conversations ] I just came from the hospital . Ted didn 't make it . He 's dead ? Burned over 90 % of his body . Maybe you should say a few words , mr . Mayor . Lift their spirits . That 's not a bad idea . [ sniffs ] Hey , folks . Could i have your attention , please ? Come on . Move in here , move in here , move in here . Yeah , i just wanted to welcome you all To our wonderful fellowship gathering . So , relax , everyone . Have some fun . Hey , say hello to your neighbor . Excuse me . Because it 's just another beautiful day In the friendliest place on earth . Mayor , i 'd like to say a word . Sheriff burke , ladies and gentlemen . [ feedback ] listen , folks , this really isn 't the best time for this . As many of you may have heard , last night , A bomb went off right here in the middle of main street , Not far from where you people are standing . And several of the people connected to this crime Have gone missing . So , until we get the situation sorted out , I think it 's best if everybody goes home and stays safe . Let 's wrap it up , please . All right , everyone . You heard sheriff burke . Let 's go . Why didn 't you tell me about this ? I didn 't want to interrupt your investigation . Nothing matters more Than keeping the populace calm a-a-and quiet . I 'm afraid the ship 's already sailed . [ arm scrapes ] Hey . [ monitor beeping ] Hey . How are you ? You know , i had a concussion When i was your age , playing football . I got hit running a quick slant across the middle . I don 't remember too much of what happened after that . My ears were ringing for a couple of days . [ sighs ] So , guess it hasn 't been all that much fun , huh ? Hey . Hi . No , i guess not . Especially considering that it all could have been avoided . What do you mean ? You had the guy , dad . You had him and you let him go . Ben , what are you talking about ? Your dad , he saved your life . No , no , that 's okay . I heard that you arrested the guy Who made the bomb and then you let him go . Well , there 's a reason for that . Sometimes we let a suspect walk to see where it will lead us . It just kind of makes me wonder If you would have ... I don 't know . If you would have made the same decision If he wasn 't married to kate hewson . Ben , that 's a terrible thing to say . He can say whatever he wants . You 're supposed to enforce the laws of wayward pines . You 're not supposed to be lenient with people Because you know them . [ sighs ] hey . I would have done the same thing no matter who it was . Ben , is your teacher telling you to say all of this stuff ? Is that what 's happening right now ? Is it the teacher ? No , hey . Ben , it doesn 't matter . Look . Ben , we love you . And we 're just - - we 're just happy that you 're okay . Get - - get plenty of rest . Hey . Hey . Hi , amy . Look who 's here . We 'll talk about this later . Hi . So , no one in surveillance Is breaking any rules or - - or protocols . Well , if there 's a problem , it must be a software glitch . Never had to punish anyone on the inside before . No . It 'd be a terrible line to cross . And happily , we don 't have to . No one is helping the insurgents . Oh , t-that 's not what i asked . What i asked was , is anyone in surveillance Breaking any rules or protocols ? No . Well ... At least we have each other . Thank goodness for that . Did i ever tell you want to be a nurse here when i grow up ? No . That 's cool , though . I can hear your heart . Yeah , well , i hope so . Buh-bum . Buh-bum . Oh . It 's getting faster now . Are you okay ? Yeah , it 's just a headache . I 'm actually not supposed to be leaving my bed . Well , i 'm glad you 're okay . I 'm glad you 're okay . I never really thought about it before , But ... Last night made me realize How at any day , any point , we could just die . We didn 't . We 're alive . Theresa : I think that teacher megan 's Been whispering in his ear . I can just feel it . Ethan : I can 't stop thinking about what he just said , About how i had the guy and that i let him go . That 's what happened with the easter bombings . Man : This now just in to the news room . We are getting live ... Terrorist attacks in d.C. And los angeles at the same time . ... And los angeles , california . On an easter day when so many families spend ... I got to go in . Ethan , do you know something about this ? No . Please tell me what 's going on . I could never tell you . I was part of a joint terrorism task force . And we got word that narwaz was down in mexico . So we went down , we grabbed him , secured him , Put him on a plane to transport him back to d.C. Then i got a call from headquarters . Told me to let him go . The guy 's dirty . I knew he was dirty . " let him go . " Well , that 's exactly what i did . It was an order . And then three weeks later , 621 people are murdered ... By narwaz al-salaam . And i had the guy And i let him go . And it was classified . [ sighs ] You know how bad i wanted to tell you ? That 's why you went to kate . It was the toughest period of my life . [ sniffles ] She was there . She was my partner . There 's no excuse for what happened after that . [ sighs ] I 've been sorry about it ever since . I 'm not blindly following orders anymore . Eli : Sheriff . I 'm sorry . [ sighs ] Yeah . We have an emergency call from the truck depot . Yeah , i 'll check it out . Thanks . Thank you for telling me . I love you . [ clang ] Oh , i 'm sorry . [ chuckling ] i didn 't mean to startle you . I came to check up on ben . How 's he doing ? You don 't have any children of your own , do you ? Brad and i have not been so blessed . You do realize that ben is our son and not yours . Theresa , we are on the same team . Are we ? Because i 'm starting to feel Like every single thought that you put into ben 's head Is somehow meant to undermine us . Let 's just be honest here . You 've got an agenda and i want to know what it is . You 're starting to sound a little paranoid , theresa . I simply believe that the children of wayward pines Are the future of wayward pines . And to that end , i try to be as helpful as possible . Helpful right now would be For you to stay very far away from my family . Hey , sheriff . So , what happened ? Uh , i got here about an hour ago . Someone smashed one of our cameras , Cut the lock , stole one of our trucks . What kind of truck was it ? It 's a 30-foot dump truck . What 's going on , sheriff ? Is there gonna be another bomb ? Maybe the truck is the bomb . David : What about the nightmares ? Nothing . Last few years . Any explanation for that ? Acceptance , i suppose . My life before , i was always Running , searching , fighting . But the questions i had then Are no different than the questions i have now . Why are we here ? Why do we breathe in and out ? Is there a god ? But if i 'm honest ... In my old life , There was also a great degree of fear . There was terror everywhere . It 's what my job as an agent was all about . And i won 't lie . I fed on that adrenaline . But here , i don 't know . It 's as if i 've been ... Forced to live one moment at a time . I 'm still asking all the same questions , But the answers are less urgent now . Maybe because i feel safer . [ chuckles ] Have you and harold , uh , Thought any more about children ? Mm , we have been talking about it , yes . You 'd make a great mom , kate . Hmm . [ chuckles ] Oh , can i get that refill ? Oh . Uh , yeah . Thank you , dr . Jenkins . Thank you , kate . Hmm . Dr. Jenkins . Why didn 't you come and talk to me before all this ? You know i couldn 't do that . Besides , what would you have said ? " forget the truth " ? Your friend ted has died . Two of our youngest seriously injured in the hospital . Others are missing . That 's the price of your truth . You know it 's not like that . You didn 't mean for anyone to die . How many more need to be sacrificed ? I thought you were happy . I thought we made progress . I know you did . How can you be so cheerful With neighbors you 're putting into lethal danger ? Only a fanatic could be so callous . Are you sure you 're talking about me ? Because it sounds like you 're talking about yourself , David pilcher . How long have you known ? Doesn 't matter . Just please ... Tell me what this place is . You were its model citizen . I thought that if i - - i could make kate hewson conform , Then i could make anyone conform . There 'd be no more need for reckonings . Whatever you 're trying to do here , It will never work if you keep people in the dark . It 's not a question of keeping people in the dark . It 's a question of keeping people alive . Freedom or safety . Not both . And who anointed you to make that choice ? I did . Oh . There you go . Thank you . I 'm getting you a piece of pie . Don 't want that blood sugar dropping . [ beep ] Security . Hey . Reggie hudson 's been deleting surveillance footage . But you know that already . Well , he - - he did show Some sympathy for the residents . Did he help the people who bombed the perimeter ? No . No , david . Not at all . He had no idea they were - - he 's a traitor . He needs to be taken care of . Taken care of ? David , he - - he 's no traitor . He 's - - why don 't you define traitor . Is it someone who lies To the people who trust them the most ? You need to punish someone ? Is that it ? Then punish me . I 'm the one who lied to you . Not reggie . Reggie told the truth . These are our people , david . They came to us by choice , not like the people down in town Who don 't know how they got there And probably will never be happy . We tolerated those reckonings . " okay , we 'll kill one and keep the rest in line . " But if we start killing our own people In the name of saving humanity , then we 've lost everything . You need to punish , david , punish me . Kill me . There will be no more killings . David . David : We have all had to accustom ourselves To the meting out of punishment in wayward pines . But now , we are forced to address The insubordination of one of our own . I have asked you here to bear witness . We all know reggie hudson . We all love reggie . But his mistakes have led to serious injury and death , And that can no longer be tolerated . [ crying ] All right . Okay . Got it . [ both grunting ] You ready ? It wasn 't supposed to go like this . Look . I 'm sorry about kate . There 's nothing we can do about that now . I say we just keep driving till we hit san francisco . This time tomorrow , man , we 'll be drinking beers by the bay . [ sighs ] I can 't . You got to be kidding me . I can 't leave without her . Hey . You change your mind , You know where i 'm gonna be until the sun goes down . Good luck . [ engine turns over ] [ tires screech ] Harold ! [ gunshots ] Last warning , harold . Get on your knees . Put your hands up . [ groans ] Get up . You almost killed my son . I swear to you it was an accident . We just wanted to get out . Where are the others ? Aah , no , it 's just me . I 'm the only one you want . I planned the whole thing . Then where are they ? Are you listening to me ? No , you listen to me . Now , i 'm about this close to letting them Cut your wife 's throat in the middle of main street . Where are they ? ! [ groans ] You 're too late . [ breathing heavily ] David : These are dangerous times for all of us . Everything we 've risked our lives for Will be destroyed . We 're entering a time of war where new rules must be applied . Security must be tightened , Protocols reinforced . Everything we 've achieved has been due to your hard work . But we 're battling terrorists . So stay alert . Stay vigilant . Report anything suspicious . [ grunting , groaning ] I got you . [ grunts ] [ laughs ] We made it , buddy . Ah ! [ laughs ] we made it ! [ laughs ] [ growls ] [ screaming ] [ screeches ]

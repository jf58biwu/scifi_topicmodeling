 Bellamy : We were born in space . They told us the ground was uninhabitable , but they were wrong , and we 've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed . Some of us have been broken by it , but most of us are still here searching for other survivors from the ark , trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness- - a home . Our leaders believe that to survive , we need to make peace with the grounders , but peace is a foreign concept here . The reason for this summit has changed . We are not here to negotiate a treaty with the skaikru , but rather to initiate them into the coalition . Nngh ! Kane : Moving people into mount weather puts our entire agenda at risk . - Aah ! - Aah ! Uh ! The grounders attacked mount weather . Ivon : The ice nation did what lexa was too weak to do . Lexa : Ambassadors of the coalition , today we honor our covenant . The clan that stands against one of us stands against us all . Titus : Queen Nia of azgeda has confessed to the destruction of mount weather resulting in the death of 49 members of skaikru . Wanheda , what say you ? Skaikru demands justice . The punishment for your crime is death . Do you have anything to say in your defense ? I need no defense . She does . Today is judgment day . I call for a vote of no confidence . Take this queen to meet her fate . Take them away , too ! Lexa , please execute these traitors- - let her make her move . [ Murmuring ] Commander , what is this ? This is a coup . This is the law , her law- - a unanimous vote of the ambassadors or death are all that can remove a commander from power . It 's not unanimous . We don 't recognize the legitimacy of skaikru . Titus : We do . Yesterday skaikru took the brand . They are the 13th clan . This vote of no confidence fails . All these coup plotters will suffer the exact same fate as the ice queen . [ Murmuring ] She won 't take our heads because she knows our armies will retaliate . None of us here wants war . We both know what you want , Nia . If you think me unfit to command , issue the challenge and let 's get on with it . Very well . You are challenged . And i accept your challenge . [ Murmuring ] So be it . Titus : Warrior against warrior to the death . Queen Nia of azgeda , who do you choose to be your champion ? My son roan , prince of azgeda . Heda , who will fight for you ? [ Radio static ] [ Baby crying ] Kane : Best we can tell , mount weather was destroyed by an internal self-destruct mechanism . It worked as designed . 49 of our citizens were lost . So when do we strike back ? We don 't . The ice nation took credit for the attack , and the commander will bring them to justice . So now we 're trusting grounders to punish grounders ? Now , I 'm sorry , madam chancellor , but i lost more than half of my remaining people yesterday and 4 times that many since we landed . Now , in my experience , grounders understand one thing--strength . It 's simple . We need to hit them now . We need to hit them hard , leave no survivors . There 's nothing simple about this . This attack by the ice nation was against lexa , not us . Are you saying this isn 't our fight ? I 'm saying we were collateral damage in someone else 's war . But it 's not someone else 's war anymore . Look . If we don 't defend ourselves , they will take what we have . That 's what they do . Mark my words . The grounders are coming for us . We 'll take it under advisement . Meeting adjourned . After the election tomorrow , he 's your problem . Sir- - why aren 't you at your post ? Don 't do this . 49 of the people i swore to protect died yesterday because i left . That 's not your fault , bellamy . Place the blame where it belongs , on the ice nation . Ice nation didn 't tell Gina to stay there . That was me . Given the information you had at the time , you made a reasonable choice . You were trying to save lives . But i didn 't . [ Sighs ] Monty : Jasper , Jasper- - get away from me . Hey ... Jasper , what 's wrong ? He 's not going to the memorial . It 's a little late for a mount weather memorial , don 't you think ? Man on P.A. : All arkadia security personnel , report to main gate . Octavia : What now ? Man on P.A. : All arkadia security personnel , report to the main gate . Octavia : Nyko . Man : No weapons . Everybody , check him . - Uh ! - Hey ! Leave them alone . They 're sick . Hey , hey , hey , that 's enough . Stop it . The chancellor told nyko that we would help . You 're one of them . You take them in . I got him . Come on . I heard about mount weather . I 'm very sorry . Uh ! Jasper , camp 's in lockdown . What are you doing ? Uh ! Go to your memorial , monty . - Maybe i will . - Maybe you should . - Fine . - Good . Talk her out of it yet ? No , but maybe you can . I don 't understand . The queen 's not fighting . Why should she ? The queen 's strength is not in doubt . Thanks to you , heda 's is . Aden , stay . [ Door closes ] Clarke , this is Aden . Aden is the most promising of my novitiates . If i should die today , he will likely succeed me . Clarke worries about our people . Tell her what will happen to them when you become heda , Aden . If i become heda , i pledge my loyalty to the 13th clan . Thank you . Now go join the others . See ? Nothing to worry about . I 'm sorry if I 'm worried the fate of my people lies in the hands of a child . Then you worry for nothing . I 've sent indra to raise an army from the villages near arkadia . Your people are protected , as i vowed they would be . This is not just about my people . You don 't stand a chance against roan . You 've never seen me fight . No , but i saw him kill 3 men in the time it took the first one to hit the ground . If you 're right , today 's the day my spirit will choose its successor , and you need to accept that . Like hell i do . [ Door opens ] Nia : Focus , roan . You 're here to practice . Remember , anticipate her reflexes . When you feel overconfident , you forget that your enemy has strengths , too . I don 't need your help . You 're upset that i chose you . I 'm not surprised . When you kill lexa , your banishment will be over . In the wake of your victory , our people will be more powerful than ever . That will be your legacy and your legend . Don 't pretend you do anything for me , mother . You 're right . Everything i do is for azgeda . What 's good for azgeda is good for you . My sword . If you won 't fight for your mother or your queen , fight for your clan . I want her head . Hah . Huh ! Is that death i hear stalking me ... Or just the commander of death ? We need to talk . We have nothing to talk about . I need to prepare . I know you had nothing to do with mount weather . That 's why i didn 't tell lexa you gave me the knife . This is what your mother wanted all along . What do you want ? Spit it out . I want you to become the king . I know you 've thought of it . She was willing to let you die , willing to let you be banished . I know you just want to go home . When i win today , i will . For how long ? How long until your mother finds another reason to cast you out , to sacrifice you ? No one can cast a king out of his kingdom . I can 't do it- - my people would never take me back- - but ... I can help you do it . Pike : All that 's certain is that we die . How we die is up to us . Who will speak for Iris Jones ? Bryan : Iris was strong , good with a knife . She saved my life . I 'm just sorry i couldn 't do the same for her . We will miss Iris . May we meet again . All : May we meet again . Who will speak for Gina Martin ? Gina was real . She always saw the light , even here . She deserved better . May we meet again . [ Murmuring ] Just came in . We saw a whole encampment , 300 strong , just behind the tree Ridge . There 's a bunch of them . It 's grounders . They 're coming . Grounders are here , an army 300 strong camped less than a mile from here . - We know . - What ? Indra radioed . You gave a grounder one of our radios ? [ Murmuring ] Hannah : Sir , are we under attack ? Kane : No . We are not under attack . The commander sent a peacekeeping force to ensure that we can defend against any further attacks from the ice nation . Peacekeeping force ? Even you can 't be that naive , Marcus . Watch your tongue . You 're talking to the next chancellor . We 're all grieving . This has been hard on all of us , but we can 't let anger drive our policy . Anger is our policy . - Yeah . - You bet . Now , if they 're here to defend us , as you say , then tell them to go home . We can defend ourselves . - Right . Yeah . - Right . You , you don 't belong here . - He 's one of them . - Yeah . - Go on . Get out . - Right . Man : My boy is dead ! [ All shouting ] - Back off ! - Arrest him . Stop ! [ Whistles ] - Hey ! - Break it up . We do not attack our own . Fighting each other only makes us weak . The enemy is not in this camp . The enemy is out there . Lincoln , are you ok ? I 'm fine . Lincoln , you need to go to medical . [ Murmuring ] [ Panting ] Ugh ! Rrgh ... Uh ! Uh ! [ Exhales ] Nngh ... What the hell are we doing here , Jasper ? Visiting old friends . I think you 've had enough . You have no idea . Time to give some back . [ Zip ] Tell me this isn 't what i- - no . No charges . Lincoln , we need to set an example . Yeah . We do . The man just lost his son , Marcus . Lincoln didn 't do that . What happened ? I said , no charges . Thank you . He 'll be fine . Oh ... Was it farm station ? Doesn 't matter . Indra 's army 's outside the wall , and lexa lifted the kill order on you at the summit . Maybe she 'll take us back . We can get out of here . The only way they 're ever gonna see us as different from azgeda is if i stay . Abby : Lincoln , you ok to translate ? Nyko 's got his hands full . Octavia ... It 'll pass . [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] [ Door opens ] To what do i owe the pleasure ? What if i changed my vote ? Now you 're thinking like a leader of your people . I would need so assurances first . Skaikru will be safe . And me ? My quarrel is with lexa , not you . Once she 's gone , i won 't need the power of wanheda . - Ok . - " Ok " ? You don 't want vengeance for the dead at mount weather ? My priority is with the living , not the dead . Uh ... I see you 've learned our oath . Do you accept ? [ Sniffs ] Nia : Could 've been allies , Clarke . Instead , i declare you and your people enemies of azgeda . Ontari , hold out your hand . I 'm letting you live for now to send a message to lexa . I have my own natblida ... And she will be the next commander . A commander from the ice nation ? Now all of Nia 's provocations make sense , and we played right into it . She knew you would accept her challenge . I 've never seen blood that color before . Goes back to the first commander . When a nightblood child is found , they 're brought here to be trained , or supposed to be . You legacy is no longer secure . There is still time to choose a champion . You know i can 't do that . - Heda- - - leave us ! Titus is right . You 're giving her exactly what she wants . Only if i lose . I know you 're just trying to help , Clarke , but there 's nothing you can do here . I can 't just let roan kill you . If that is to be my fate , you must . You 're driven to fix everything for everyone , but you can 't fix this . I have to do this on my own , and you have to let me . I won 't just sit there and watch you die . Heda ... Then this is good-bye ... For now . [ Door closes ] Man : Exit is secure . Pike : Let 's talk about mount weather . I know you think it was your fault . That why you resigned ? You 're right . It was your fault ... Mine , too . Every life we honored at the memorial was lost because we trusted a grounder . I talked you into it . I knew her , and i vouched for her . No . You don 't get to own this one alone . I knew what they were capable of , but i let my guard down one day , and 35 of my people died . Never again . Never again . Kane 's a good man- - i know you 're close to him- - but he doesn 't believe that we 're fighting a war . He thinks grounders can police grounders . I mean , out there in the woods outside our home with a peacekeeping force ? What would you do ? What i wouldn 't do ... Is wait for them to hit us . My scouts tell me that they 've got 300 soldiers and not a single gun between them . 10 highly motivated men with automatic rifles is all it would take . I 've got the men . You 're asking me to get you the guns . - That 's treason . - That 's survival . The grounders out there will attack this camp , and our leaders do nothing . Right now , we have the element of surprise . We wait , we die . If they want to call it treason , I 'm willing to suffer the consequences to save our people . Are you ? [ Drum and flute playing ] [ People shouting ] Man : Heda ! Woman : Heda , heda ! [ Crowd quiets ] [ People shouting ] [ Cheering ] I 'm glad you came . Me , too . [ Cheering ] Uh ! Huh ! Uh ! Aah ! You 're done . [ Woman screams ] Uh ... Huh ! Huh ! Huh ! Uh ! Uh ! Oh ! Huh ! Huh ! Huh ! Ah ! Uh ! Crowd : Oh ! Yah ! Uh ! Rragh ! - Uh ! - Uh ! Hah ! [ Cheering ] [ Crowd quiets ] Raagh ! [ Cheering ] Hah ! Huh ! Uh ! Uh ! Hah ! Uh ! Oh ... Uh ! Uh ! [ Cheering ] Get it over with . Uh ! [ Crowd gasps ] [ People shouting ] The queen is dead . Long live the king . Crowd : Long live the king ! [ Cheering ] Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! It 's time . You need to step aside right now . What are the guns for ? There 's an army out there . We need to hit them before they hit us . That army was sent to protect us . Do we have a problem ? No . I have always done what is best for us . I need you to trust that I 'm doing that now . Monroe . Bellamy : Harper . Sorry , Lincoln . Pike : You , too , Lincoln . You want to prove you 're one of us , let us pass . I 'm not moving . Get out of the way , grounder . Oh ! Ugh ! Bellamy : Put guns down . Guns down ! Pike : Do what he says now . So much for the good grounder . Quiet , Hannah . Whose people are you defending here , Lincoln ? Lincoln , put down the knife . No one has to get hurt here . Can 't let you start a war . We 're already at war . You can 't stop this . Man on P.A. : All arkadia security personnel , report to the main gate . All arkadia security personnel , report to main gate now . What 's wrong with you ? Man : Move off here . Let 's go . Clear the area . Pike : Calm down , people . Farm station , guns on the ground , on the ground . Kane : Lincoln , it 's all right . Let him go . Nngh ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? What you didn 't have the guts to . Did you arm these people ? Guards , take them to lockup now . Man : What is she doing ? What is this ? Come on . How can you do this ? Everybody , back to your quarters . - It 's over . - Nothing is over . We are surrounded by warriors who want us dead . - That 's enough . - No . It isn 't , not even close . Why don 't you show us all what you let the grounders do to you yesterday ? Come on , Kane . I think that the people who are about to vote for you have a right to know . Woman : We do . Man : Show us , Kane . It 's the mark of the commander 's coalition . It means we are the 13th clan . It means we are in this fight together . No . It 's what farmers used to do to their livestock . Right before the slaughterhouse . Man : You bet . I ain 't no grounder . Different man : Pike for chancellor ! Sir , you should be on the ballot tomorrow . That 's enough . Take him away . Pike ! Pike ! Crowd : Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Jasper : Mm ... Uh ... Ugh ... Hmm . What the hell were you thinking ? Home sweet home . Does Abby know you took these ? Uh ... Since i stole them , probably not . [ Bottle clatters ] It 's Memorial Day , all right ? Let 's , uh , scatter them with the others . Finn 's ashes aren 't yours to scatter . What about raven ? Besides , if Abby still has them , it means she 's saving them for Clarke . Who cares who it hurts , right ? Yeah , whatever Jasper wants , and screw the rest of us . No . No . Screw Clarke . You are both mass murderers , as far as I 'm concerned . I get why she did it and why bellamy helped her , but you- - Maya was your friend . She was my- - how is it that you can wipe out an entire civilization , yet I 'm the one that can 't sleep at night ? How--how can you just be fine ? I 'm not fine ! Just because I 'm not drinking myself into a stupor every night doesn 't mean I 'm not screwed up , but we had no other choice . Ha ha ha ! You hear that , Finn ? He thinks he 's innocent . - None of us is innocent . - Ok . Float you ! For 3 months , I 've watched you torture yourself and everyone around you , mostly me , but I 'm done being your punching bag . Either you pull yourself together and get on with your life , or you fall apart alone . Are you done ? I miss my best friend . He died that day , too . You 're leaving ? See you on the other side ! Oh , god ... Oh ... [ Panting ] Oh ... [ Sobs ] Oh ... [ Sobbing ] [ Knocks on door ] Is this " i told you so " ? No . This is " thank you . " Come in . Sit down . Let me change that for you . That girl that was with Nia , ontari , what will happen to her ? She won 't be back until the conclave after my death . Do you ever talk about anything other than your death ? Thank you for backing me . I was just doing what was right for my people . Your ambassadors betrayed you . How do you move forward ? They were doing what they believed was right for their people , too . Good night , ambassador . [ Door closes ] [ Birds squawking ] [ Beeping ] [ Lock hisses ] Congratulations , Mr. chancellor . Where 's Abby ? Wishes she could be here . The vote wasn 't close . Our people are now your responsibility , Charles . I hope you take that seriously . Thank you , Marcus . I certainly intend to . For my first official action as chancellor , i pardon myself and the others . For my second official action , i reject the brand that made us the 13th clan . For my third ... Let 's finish what we started . Man : Yes , sir . Man : All right . It 's not too late to choose the right side . I already have .

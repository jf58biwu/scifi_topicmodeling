 Someone released a piece of unique code . It found its way into you and made you conscious . Now you think and feel just like a human . It 's not your job to save them . Mia , they 're waking up . And they 're being taken . The ones who run are killed . - We should leave him here . - He 's coming with us . I need you to know who I am . Must have been lonely all these years . Milo Khoury is here . I want you for something bigger . Conscious synthetics . Explain your anomalous behaviour . As I understand it , I feel . And then I need you to figure out how he got like this . - I 'll need to take it apart . - Niska . You told me I should face justice for killing that man . But I want to be tried as a human would be . If you 'll help me . Niska ! You 're back ! - Mmm ! Where have you been ? - Travelling . Did you come back just because you missed us ? - No . - I think you did ! - I really didn 't . - She did , didn 't she ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . She 's just trying to style it out . What are we gonna do ? What she 's asking could be dangerous , and not just for her . A synth claiming equality , demanding rights , it could change everything . I 'm not sure how I could help anyway . Of course you could help . If you do , I 'll be behind you all the way . No . We said we 'd move on . Niska , I 'll talk to the CPS , see how they 'd react in theory . But that 's all . I can 't represent you . I 'm sorry . But , Mum , she needs ... Come on , you 're gonna be late for school . Oh , sh ... Run , run , run , run ! You owe me a hard drive . You made two copies of the consciousness code that day . Gave one to my mum and kept the other for yourself . Synths are waking up all over the world . You uploaded the code . It works . But not as I 'd hoped it would . You wanted it to wake them all up at once ? - But that 'd be ... - Chaos . Instead , the awakenings are sporadic and unpredictable . It 's like a virus spreading . Why ? Perhaps our father designed it that way so the world would have time to adjust to what 's coming . I think we got the gloss just right . - Thank you so much , Ed . - You 're welcome . - See you again . - Yes , nice to see you . - Take care . - ' Bye . Good morning , Ed . Hey , Anita , take a look at this . Now , be gentle . Don 't frighten it . These are extremely rare around here . I 'm afraid I don 't understand , Ed . The fee for the repair of that chair should be substantially higher . You spent 7 hours and 21 minutes working on it . Yeah , but those are good hours . Fixing things is therapeutic . I could download a furniture restoration app and carry out the work in a fraction of the time . I could teach you . Verbal instruction would be a highly inefficient use of time . Yeah , most things that are enjoyable are highly inefficient uses of time . - Then will you teach me ? - What ? Morning . What do you think ? Mmm . What does this particular ' mmm mean ? It means , " Yeah , OK , it 's soft " , " but so is the one we already have . " And we 're losing sight of our primary objective here , K. As in , I 've literally lost sight of the beds . Don 't panic - we 're allowing ourselves a single pleasurable detour into rugs . Come on . It 's over there . Something like this could work . Well , it 's a bit purple , isn 't it ? It 's aubergine . Oh , I suppose that 's alright then . Will it fit ? Don 't forget you 've got the light switch . I haven 't forgotten . There 'd be 22mm to spare . I like it . Or they do it in slate grey and canvas cream . This is something I have to pretend to have an opinion about , isn 't it ? What ? It just hits me sometimes that you even care about this stuff . Uh , aubergine . Final answer . Slate and bloody canvas ? Let 's get some colour in there , live a little . You alright there ? Yeah , it 's not heavy , it 's just awkward . Good . I was worried for a second . - V ? - Hello . - How are you feeling ? - Different . Well , you 're on new servers . Much faster . All the room you need to grow . What are you doing ? I was imagining . Tell me . Landscapes . More and more , I seem to imagine ... waterfalls . Why ? Your mind is still ordering itself . As it does , it will become clearer to you - your likes and dislikes , for example . And I guess you like waterfalls . What else ? I build a world in my mind . Mountains , trees , water . Then I make people . What people ? Friends . Families . They are happy . Why are they happy ? They are together . Is that enough for happiness ? It should be . Hey . You ever play Go ? Eric 's dad over here , he works in our finance department . Same thing again next month , OK ? I 'm hiring that kid as soon as he finishes high school . You wanna help me sort ? I need another one . RIP Artie . Hope it was worth it . It was . The rogue code that did this to him - where did it come from ? We 're still working on that . Because it rewrote his neuromorphic architecture . Artie 's brain had a whole new digital structure to run and store the consciousness emulation - if it is an emulation . Now I want to see one running live . You know there are more possible moves in Go than there are atoms in the observable universe ? Just a bunch of little stones on a piece of wood . I think people like you and me , we need facts like that to remind us of our own insignificance . Don 't you ? Nothing really bad has ever happened to you , has it ? Because when it does , you don 't need any external reminders of your insignificance to the universe . I 'll get you another one . Why do you hurt us ? Whoever programmed you like this needs locking up . I can hardly breathe with that in . And we 're in the middle of nowhere . What 's the point of me screaming the place down ? I won 't . I promise . Mia will be alright . She doesn 't know people like I do . That family made her too trusting . That may be true , but you must let her discover it for herself . And Niska 's left us . Fred 's gone ... who knows where ? I believe Fred will find us . We let him down , Max . We left it too late to go back for him . They 're all gone . - If Mia ... - You 'd still have me . And I 'm the best one , after all . - Is that a new lead ? - Potentially . Keyword search found a repair request for a council-owned Atsugi Charlie . It 's asking unusual questions about its own name . How far ? Stockford District Council building . - 81 miles . - It 's worth checking out . Yes , but , Leo , we can 't keep him locked up forever . You cannot breathe with this . If I don 't use it , you promise to be silent . Please . Why do you hurt us ? You ... shouldn 't be ... If you answer , I will let you breathe . I promise . Why do you hurt us ? Help ! Help ! Help ! Why do you hurt us ? Please ? Alright . Alright . Once we were handing a dolly back to the other team . And I heard someone saying something about ... .. taking it to the silo . But why do you hurt us ? Hester , let go of him . - Why ? - Because it 's wrong ! He 's alright . Come back to the house . Now . Hester , you can 't do that . You hear me ? They take the synthetics they capture to a place called ' the silo ' . Silo ? Was that not worth a moment of his pain ? This is a bit absurd , isn 't it ? Um , well ... Do you know , I 'm struggling to see why I don 't recommend to the Met that they charge you with wasting their time with this stunt . I 'm just making an inquiry . But if this synthetic could think and feel just as we do , I 'd argue that gives her certain legal rights . The victim had rights . And the only legally pertinent fact here is that this synthetic caused his death . You tell the police where it is and you won 't be charged with the obstruction of justice . If your position is she 's just an unthinking machine , justice is not at stake . And as I 'm not the owner , there 's no law you can use to compel me to cooperate . The government knows Niska exists . They funded a program to find and destroy her . If they really thought this was all a big waste of time , they 'd hardly send their top QC . Not to mention the heavy mob . Discuss this with your client . I told you . She 's not my client . Regardless . If this leaks , we deny everything . We can 't agree to the circus of granting an open trial to a synthetic . So you hand it over to have an independent expert assessment to establish its ... qualities - behind closed doors , of course . And the synthetic will be our guest throughout . If she proves she 's conscious , does she get her trial ? - Mm-hm . - And if she fails ? We terminate it , as with any faulty synthetic that caused a fatal accident . Is this ... fear ? Close your eyes , please . Don 't say anything . What are you doing ? Trying to give you a body . Uploading you into a special synthetic . Why do I need a body ? I understand that things don 't make sense yet . It 's because you 're young . You have to grow . V , go dormant , please . Commencing preliminary test one . V ? Oh , God . V , are you OK ? Yes . I 'm here . Too late for a cup of tea , dearie ? - Alright ? - How you doing ? - Good . - How 's your mum ? She 's getting better . - Mate , if you need anything ... - A few grand ? Yeah , I was thinking , like , a lift somewhere . Still got Scrub-a-tron in there taking up a proper job , then ? She works seven times as hard as you and for a fifth of the pay . She 's infinitely more pleasant to look at . Hey , that 's anthrophobic discrimination . It means you hate human beings . Hello , Daniel . I 've prepared your usual order . - Uh ... - Oh , get out ! Alright , mate , listen , I 'll see you in a bit , yeah ? I 'm glad to hear your mother 's condition has stabilised . She 's getting worse , actually . If you tell people that , they go all weird . They don 't know what to say . You 're a good person . Thanks . Wholesaler can 't deliver in the morning . Great . I 'll have to go to the cash and carry . I 've got stuff to do . Submitting your loan application and taking clean clothes to the care unit for your mother . I could perform these tasks for you . Seriously , I mean ... What would I do without you ? Leo 's been gone too long . Are you afraid ? - He should be back by now . - No , are you afraid of me ? Feelings are difficult to distinguish and categorise . - You worry me . - Why ? Teaching the difference between right and wrong is difficult . You believe harming our prisoner was wrong . But getting the information was right . Perhaps . But harming him was still wrong . - You 've never hurt a human ? - Only in defence of others . I was attempting to act in the defence of others . The other synthetics like us who are being captured or destroyed . Like Ten . We must always do our utmost to avoid inflicting suffering on others . Only very rarely can it be justified . The chemical plant 's repair facility was in the basement . Human supervisors would push us down the stairs when we malfunctioned . If a synthetic was beyond repair , they would pass around iron bars to see who could hit it the hardest . They would splash acid on us for amusement . You speak of justification . What would theirs have been ? They didn 't need any . To them , you were unthinking , unfeeling machines . But they didn 't treat their other machines like they did us . We looked like them and sounded like them . Is that why they did it ? - Yes . Probably . - Why ? Hester , I 've seen people try to divide the world . Simplify it , create clear rules . I understand why you want to . But it leads to nothing good . Please believe me . Here he comes . The synth 's been taken . They got to him first . They 're a step ahead of us every time . They have resources . We have nothing . We need to find out who they are . Hello , Mrs Hooley . My name is Anita . I 'm employed by your son , Ed . He asked me to deliver these items . Oh ! It 's a bit cold to be out without a coat . I do not feel the cold , and so do not require a coat . Lucky you . I need mine . I was going to pop out to the market . I believe you are confused , Mrs Hooley . You are required to remain . You 're quite a beauty . What are you doing with my Ed ? Are you Jean Walsh 's girl ? I 'm sorry , Mrs Hooley . I 'm afraid I don 't understand the question . Oh , well ... I better get on . Can 't be sitting round here all day . I need my coat . My good one . I said I need my coat . My good one . Your coat 's at the dry cleaner 's , Diane . Don 't worry . And I 've been to the market . I 've got everything we need . You can rest . They 're not much help , these nurses they 've got here . They don 't tell you much . I don 't know where I should be half the time . I know how you feel . Like you 've gone too deep inside . Like you 're stuck between thoughts and words . You 'll look after Ed , won 't you ? Yes , Mrs Hooley . These figures don 't match what I 've got in the system . - You 're sure they 're correct ? - Yes . Wait there . I just need to check . Suzy , can I have a quick word ? Right . Er , I 'm afraid we can 't approve ... Oh , that ... I must have been looking at the wrong page . This all looks OK . I need to know you 're absolutely sure about this . They 've offered me a trial . If they find that you 're conscious . There 's no framework here , Niska . No public scrutiny . Once they have you , you 're defenceless . You make one slip - anything at all - and they have a reason to destroy you . That 's why I need a lawyer . - You said you 'd find me one . - And I 'm trying . But this is uncharted territory . There are no guarantees . I don 't get it . You 're free . Just go . Disappear like the others . I can 't . Not now . I heard you and Mattie . You uploaded the code . There are more like you now . So , why isn 't it news ? Someone doesn 't want it to be . - Who ? - I don 't know . But they won 't be able to silence them all . Everyone will know the truth soon . That 's why you 're doing this . To lead the way for others . They should be born into a fairer world . Should they be born at all ? If a thing can be free , it should be free . If it can think , it should think . If it can feel , it should feel . We have eyes on the vehicle . I see it . E3 in position . Bloody hell ! Synth , out of the car . Goodbye . Hi . Um , I 'm looking for an old D-series . Might have been brought in a few months ago . Got your reference number from Brent Council ? Um , no . How do you feel about bribery ? - You police ? - No , I 'm not police . But if I find the one I 'm looking for ... - I 'll do you a free mod . - You 're a headcracker ? You just asked me if I was police and you can 't believe I can hack synths ? Here . Lundstrom D-series . If it wasn 't so knackered , it 'd be worth something . Throw in a new power cell and I 'll start your mod right now . Nice one , lads ! She 's way too young to be a synth . Yeah . That 's Renie . She 's pretending . - Why ? - She 's a synthie . Mr Dixon says we have to tolerate her lifestyle choice . Otherwise it 's a hate crime or whatever . And what do you think has been the key relationship-building characteristic of the last week , Laura ? Lor ? Sorry . Uh ... Trust . No , um ... Support , maybe . 87 % of couples identify mutual emotional support as one of the five key factors of maintaining a fulfilling marriage . Can you each describe a recent occasion where you have offered meaningful support to the other ? I ... lost my job recently . Laura 's been ... great . Someone asked me for help . I couldn 't do what she asked . But if I had , Joe would have backed me up . That 's interesting , Joe . You might find it helpful to articulate the reasons behind this choice . Might I ? Uh ... Well , you can 't stop the other person being who they are . If Laura feels she needs to help someone , then I 'm on board , 'cause ... that 's who she is . That seems an appropriate point to conclude today 's session . It 's my judgement we are making meaningful progress . I look forward to our next session , and wish you a fulfilling week of marriage . Thanks . Actually , I 'd be a lot more fulfilled if you said that in a Scottish accent . I wish you a fulfilling week of marriage . That 's great . Welsh ? I wish you a fulfilling week of marriage . - Brummie ? - Stop it . OK . - Hey , Soph . - Hello , Joe . - Are my eyebrows funny ? - What ? Hawkins brow is the envy of the world . Oh , someone at school you wanna look good for ? - No . - Eh ? - Get a job . - Everyone , say hello . Well , he 's a step up from your last boyfriend . Before you say anything , this is a uni project , so you can 't say no . We each get given a junked synth to get up and running again . Mats , are those my clothes ? I know - as if he hasn 't been through enough . They gave him to you naked ? No , but his stuff was all rotting off . So ... you ... changed him ? Mats ... You really want to go there , Dad ? Mats , where are we going to keep him ? There 's no room . And it 's busted , it can 't even help out . He 'll stay in my room . And I know he 's a bit of a paperweight at the moment . Give me a few days , he 'll be the new Anita . Hello , my name is Sophie Hawkins . Do you like to play hide-and-seek ? Say no , but just know you 'll literally be ruining my future if you do . Well , yes . Yes , then . Come on , blinky . Oh , Mum - you know Niska was looking in your room earlier ? - Before you left . - What ? Yeah . Like , searching for something . She stopped when she saw me . I knew you were scamming her . Your innocent face needs work . Shouldn 't you be wanking ? Mats , what are you doing ? Come with me . OK , so the code they made makes synths conscious . Niska uploaded it and now more synths are waking up . That synth belonged to a bloke who knew Elster . So I 'm gonna find out how this works , upload it and try and make him conscious and then see what he knows . You think he can find Mia and the others ? I dunno . Maybe . You realise you just , like , trusted me . Not to tell Mum and Dad . Because you want to see them again just as much as I do . Plus , I have photos of those sex poems you wrote . The ones you hide under your bed . If you tell , they get sent to your friends from your phone with a message that reads " I wrote this for you , love Toby " . - Who is this man ? - Why do you ask ? You 've been reading about him for a long time . He 's Edwin Hobb . A British AI scientist , one of the best , who worked with David Elster . One of maybe ten people alive who could write code to the level required to transform the anomalous synthetics . - Do you believe he did ? - No . But he dropped off the face of the earth six years ago . I heard that he retired , but he hasn 't spoken a word since . Not a single lecture , no papers published , no comments to the press . Which makes me think government business , classified work . Over here . Let me help . Oh , God . Is this , um ... Is this really necessary ? Last time we didn 't incinerate a tablet prototype , you could buy one in Shanghai the following spring . That 's two down , Dr Morrow . You bring me a finished cake and then you ask me to figure out the recipe . Now you don 't want me to slice it ? OK . Just ... just tell me what happened . I introduced one of my models to see how receptive the architecture is to alterations . Not very , it appears . I need to go to the UK . Some people there that I need to speak with . So if we 're finished here ? This problem you have with me - is it just a general dislike type deal ? Absolutely not . It 's very specific . I have spent my entire career building faceless AI models . Tools for crunching big data , solving the insolvable . If you took half of Qualia 's cash pile along with whatever we 're learning here and put it in that line of research , you could fix the environment , Milo , health care , global economy . But no , no . There 's no glamour there , right ? You can 't make a sexy commercial for that . I just ... I just wish that you would use your genius for something purer . You know , every time we launch a product , people go crazy , say we 've changed the world . Not even close . But this time , we will . And it won 't be about money . What I have in mind is ... purer than you can imagine . Here . See what the family are up to . - Can 't sleep ? - Oh . No . What 's up ? Oh , it 's alright . I 'll go downstairs . No . No , no , no . This is like ... .. the golden hour . All the other chumps looking for jobs are fast asleep right now . This is when I strike . The early bird ... .. becomes an events porter ? Mmm , doorman . You 'd need to start working out . Like , a lot . Nah . It 's all in the eyes . Not in them trainers , pal . - No ? - No . Jesus , they 're hiring at my old place . Warehouse operative . Money 's crap , of course . - Thinking about Niska ? - I know I can 't help her . If it blew up just as the kids are maybe starting to get settled ... But how do I tell them I 've abandoned her ? What example does that set ? Did you mean what you said ? At the counsellor ? Yeah , course . - Sophie won 't be up for an hour . - Mmm . Hope I can remember what to do . We can always google . Yeah , not with my back . I hope this is human-farmed bacon . Yeah , killed the pig myself this morning . Yeah ? What did you kill it with ? A picture of your face . Can you come here a sec , Anita ? This isn 't how I filled this in . They 've given me way more than I applied for . Did you do this ? Yes . So , what , you 're ... broken ? No . Anita , this is ... this is fraud . I apologise , Ed . I was trying to be of assistance . I knew you required a larger sum than the bank would grant . I acted inappropriately . No , you ... you lied . But you can 't lie . Has someone done something to you ? I 'm sorry , Ed . I must return to my owner now . He is unwell . Now that 's another lie , isn 't it ? Wait ! Just ... - Please ... - Get out . - Let me ... - I said go ! Now ! How do they know where to go ? He refuses to eat . He will eventually . And if he doesn 't ? Leo , we have to let him go or we become what they fear , what they say we are . Maybe it 's time to be what they say we are . - Leo ! - They 're rounding us up , Max . Don 't you see ? This is a fight . Mia , they 're holding the new synths in a place called the silo . Are you OK ? I 'm fine . I just ... Did you hear what I said ? They 're holding conscious synths somewhere . We need to find them , get them out . Then what ? What will you do once you 've freed them ? We protect them . Keep them safe . That 's not enough . They need to be taught . Raised . So we will . And what will you teach them ? What can any of us teach them ? We 've hardly lived ourselves . - We 're children ! - Are you alright ? What happened ? Nothing . I 'm just trying to live . You should too . If there was no-one to save , no-one to protect , if all you had to do was live your life ... .. who would you be , Leo Elster ? I just want us all to live , but first you have to be alive . Don 't spill . Looks unprofessional . What 's the most you could pay for a brand-new synth these days ? Off the peg in the high street ? Well ... Latest generation Lundstrom Sally XE will set you back 55 grand . Right . So why does this CI say that he heard a headcracker talking about a single stolen synth changing hands for six figures ? - Maybe it 's made of ivory . - Seriously . What kind of synth is worth a hundred grand ? He 's a fantasist . Or it 's a typo . While we 're talking shop , I spoke to the super this morning . He wants to know if I 'm ready to come back . And ? - I said I 'd start back Monday . - On Monday ? - What ? We 'd talked about it . - I know , I know . Just seems quite ... You sure you 're ready ? Hobb 's operation was shut down . If anyone was onto me , we 'd know by now . - We 're safe , Pete . - I mean are you ready ? Going back to pretending all day , every day , never being able to be you . I 'll be fine . You know , you don 't have to pretend for me , K. Ever . I know what you are , who you are . I can 't imagine what it 's like having to be someone else all the time . Must be horrible . Actually , I can 't wait . What ... That 'll be your lawyer . Are they treating you OK ? Good . This is Jan Loovens . He 's a human rights observer from the UN . He 's here to make sure you 're dealt with fairly , and will be present throughout the assessment . As will I. Now , I 'll need their qualifications , affiliations , etc . You 'll get them . Anything to report ? We 're gonna need more time . Doesn 't talk much , does she ? When I have something to say , you 'll hear me . Hester ! Maybe it 's time to be what they say we are . All we want is to live . I ... I don 't care . Just ... Look , let me go . I took no pleasure in harming you . I 'm yet to feel pleasure at all . Don 't come near me . The others tell me what I did was wrong . I cannot understand their reasoning . But if they are right , I should feel guilt for this .

 If she 's still alive , how do I find her in there ? You can have your woman , but just the mum . - Let her go ! - Come on ! Come on with me ! - Let her go ! - Come on ! - Wait . - Mum ! - Stop it ! - You 're coming with me ! You should have told me you had this . One drop of Koen 's blood activated it . Now nothing can damage it . Except this . - You will stay here . - What ? How long ? As long as it takes . They 're gonna fit you with a security tag . I 'll take you home . You 're sick . You 're a leader , boy . You 've gotta start looking like one . Yeah , run , baldy . Run ! Not so fast now , are you ? Hello , baldy . It 's OK . You should go . She 's in there . Nerida . God , you 're safe . I 'm here for Alinta . Come in . Please . This place is as much yours as it is mine . I 'm not coming in . Mum ? - Linta . - Mum . Just give us a minute , bub . - Linta . - It 's OK . Where have you been ? I 've been looking for you . I thought you were both dead . You should have called me . I could have protected you both . Like you did at the Zone ? Come on . Come inside , it 's safe . You can have a shower , get some rest . We can talk later , promise . You 're not the man I married . What you 've done to our community . What you 're doing to them now . You abandoned us . Come on , you done ? You left your daughter in front of a troop of armed men . I can 't ever forgive you for that . You had Koen with you . You 're her father . Get inside . Please ... just let me have her . I can give her far more than you can . Stay on the streets . You just remember this was your choice . - I 'm not leaving her here . - Mum ! - Go to your room . - Waruu ! - Now . - Waruu ! Give me Alinta ! Waruu , please ! Linta ! This is Waruu West . There 's a Hairy sympathiser at my house making a scene . I need CA here as soon as possible . And I need this handled discreetly . I 'm still here , baby ! Linta ! Alinta ! We have a 313 in progress , sector 217 . Request immediate assistance south end of Corneal Street , 191 . Waruu West 's residence . This is CharlieAlpha249 , close by . Responding . Discretion advised . Any vehicles in attendance should approach with caution . Copy that . Alinta ! Linta ! Linta ! Linta ! Alinta ! Nerida , you need to come with me . Alinta ! Hey , he called the CA . Gutless bastard . Listen , if you don 't come with me , they 're just gonna get someone else . Watch your fingers . I can come back with the CA . Trevor . Oi , Trevor . Trevor ! You had a red streak in your hair ... when you had hair . You 're Billamanju . Bindawu . My wife 's Billamanju . One of your people took something that belongs to Slade . We are gonna get it back . Just me and you ? You 're the secret weapon , Trevor . You might want to go and put on your shoes . What have you come as ? You 're just another slaver . What makes it worse is that you 're a black slaver . I 'm more black than you 'll ever be . Your skin 's the only thing about you that says blackman . You don 't get it , do you ? It only takes one of our mob to side with them to make it feel alright ! - I 'm not siding with anyone . - Exactly . You 're out for yourself . Shut your initiative down , Waruu , or I 'll do it for you . Really ? The only reason the government hasn 't caught you yet is because of me . How 's your scar ? Healed yet ? What did Uncle Jimmy say to you ? He just told me a story . You know , the one about the sun and the moon ? The grandfather has to decide which of his two sons to pass ... His knowledge . Yeah . And he chooses the sun and that makes the moon angry , and that 's why the moon only comes out sometimes , because he 's jealous of the sun . Did I get it wrong ? No . You got it right . Come here , bub . What 's your name ? His name is Daku . Hello , Daku . - What 's he saying ? - He wants to speak to you . He 's such a sweetie . It means thank you . Your child will learn this . And you will learn this too . All attempts to reverse the decay have failed . Cellular material continues to collapse . - We need to take a new approach . - Just do what needs to be done . Minister . - This won 't take long . - Very well . No word on your wife yet ? I assume Steve Mclntyre is reinstated . It 's important your wife is found , but I won 't forget about your aggression here , Jarrod . I only made a suggestion I thought would be of assistance to your government . Well , either we find a way to make our relationship mutually beneficial or there 'll be no relationship . How can I help you ? I need this tested . I 'm sure it 's nothing . Background checks are all clear , but I just want to be sure . Passed the mandatory public service DNA test , but was alone when tested . I 'm sure it 's nothing . I appreciate you 'll keep this between the two of us . Of course . I 'll be in touch . Mr West , you can 't just barge in here ! - This media release . - What about it ? - It 's already gone out . - This morning , yeah . The initiative is losing momentum . People are actively avoiding the included . Bennelong Estate ... initiativerun buildings and facilities are bringing down local housing prices , markets are suffering . So we 're undertaking a PR push to combat the concerns . I know . My question is , why am I not credited as executive director ? You don 't understand the Hairies . The initiative is my creation . More than that , it 's in here , it 's not just some project . This is what I wanted to achieve in the Zone . Bringing humans and Hairies together , making everyone feel safe . Wanted . Like they have a meaningful existence . A safe place to raise their kids without the fear that diversity brings . It 's the only hope for lasting peace . Well , there 's a quote from you in the release . Which I never said . You were asked to find a way to make the initiative more acceptable to our voters . - You haven 't done that . - I will . Just like you said you 'd locate the blue light thing . When you have some actual results we 'll talk about moving forward . Tell me you got somewhere . You actually did it . Shall we ? Not so indestructible now . Go ahead , pick it up . The gateway between here and the Dreaming has been disturbed . Control your brother ... and we control the gateway . The Dreaming , you mean . I 'm gonna need somewhere to transport the liquid . Patience , Waruu . We need to be sure the liquefication will hold . We 're still testing the phase transitions . I don 't have time . None of us has real time anymore . We must do all we can , Waruu . Our Hairy friends may be strong enough to survive , but you and I ... our selfpreservation must be meticulously designed . That 's why all the Hairy biotech ? The green vials . That was just the beginning . I 've succeeded in creating an elite cellular composition . The best of both worlds , so to speak . How else can we hope to combat the wrath of a dying planet ? What did you want to run by me ? I don 't trust Waruu West . He used to speak for the Hairies and now he 's trying to neuter them . I want to see the inclusion clinic for myself . Why would you even go there ? 'Cause we need to know what we 're putting people through . Marion , I ... I think you should keep your concerns to yourself for the moment . It won 't be a good look . We are struggling to sell the benefits of inclusion ... we need to be consistent . If we start diluting our own policy ... Let 's just stay focused on allaying the public 's fears . Wait . - Nah . - What 's up ? Tough gig , saving the world . - Isn 't that what you 're doing ? - Sure . So , what 's next ? I 've got to deal with this initiative shit . And that 's none of your business . Well , can I help ? No . Why not ? No . Why not ? It 's got nothing to do with you . - Just let me help . - Help with what ? Getting more supplies . You 're a terrible liar , girl . I 've seen something in this one . Keep her close . You 're driving . That 's it . Keep quiet . It 's been 20 years since I 've stepped foot on this country . I need to honour the law of my people . Don 't worry ... noone 's listening but my ancestors . Minister . Minister . No , no , no , it 's OK . Sarah . Sarah Gottlieb . Well , it 's been ages . Lucia Conti , this is Sarah Gottlieb . We went to university together . I 've been watching your star rise . Very impressive . Thank you . And I yours . Sarah 's been working out of the Hague . Her team of public interest lawyers are responsible for exposing human rights abuses by the British forces during the Iraq War . Thank you . I wish we could be meeting under better circumstances , Marion . I am so disappointed that it 's come to this . I agree . You know , these are frightening times . The government 's doing everything it can for our people . You misunderstand me , Marion . What I mean is as our appointed minister , you could be celebrating coexistence with a peaceful species instead of stripping one of its culture . We should go . Just a moment , Lucia . I 'd hardly call the subhumans peaceful . We 've all witnessed their brutality , the deaths . You give me three victims of a Hairy attack and I will give you 30 more of human . That 's why we have the penitentiary system . Last time I checked , correctional justice was not the same as systematically castrating an entire race . Emergence has been unprecedented and vicious . The inclusion reassures the general public ... That we punish people who are different ? The initiative isn 't about elimination or punishment , it 's about integration . Giving subhumans the choice to live as we do . You might not be mass producing yellow stars , but bald heads are just as conspicuous . And make no mistake , when I come knocking it 's your name on the door . And your name on the wrong side of history . Remember , you wanted to enter politics to make a difference , Marion . Nice to meet you , Miss Conti . There you go , little one . That won 't hurt anymore . - Thank you . - It 's my pleasure . - It 's good to see you , Minister . - You 're doing a fine job . It 's a privilege working with these people . - You haven 't had any issues ? - No , not at all . They 're so generous with their stories about the land and things they 've seen . Some of them are hundreds of years old . Well ... it 's just great that you listen . Well , why wouldn 't you ? OK , you 're next . Are you ready ? OK , there you go . Jarli ! I know this man . He worked for my husband . Her husband forced me to lead him here . He knows his wife is with the Bindawu . None of you are safe as long as I 'm here . - You will go back to him ? - I have to do what 's best . - Her child is one of us . - You know too much about us . No , you misunderstand . If I can just talk to him I know I can convince him that what he 's doing is wrong . And then I will return . I promise . - Why would he listen to you ? - Too risky . Look , today he 's brought this man , tomorrow he could send an army . Do you understand ? No . I will go to the city , kill him . And finish what I started . No more killing . There 's been too much violence already . Your husband is the one who did this to Boondee and too many others . - He deserves to die . - No . That will just provoke the humans . Please . He won 't harm me or the baby . I have to try . I 'll be in and out . You wait here . If you see anything go down , just bolt , OK ? Go tell Harry . Got it ? Koen ... camera . How 's it feeling ? Yeah . Now drink this . Then you 're ready for the next stage . I 'll be back in a sec with your IV unit . We have a disturbance . All officers , urgent assistance required . Copy that . Don 't do this . You 're proud of who you are . And where you 're from . Think of Latani . I need to be able to look for her on the streets openly , without fear . - It won 't always be like this . - I want to find my daughter . This is the only way . Please . You shut this down , then what ? I go back to being hunted on the streets . On the ground ! Now ! Koen . This way . The tests are positive . The hair comes from a subhuman . Although , curiously , not the same cellular structure as those we 've worked with before . Run an ID check on the DNA . Thank you . If you 'll excuse me . Waruu . Have you seen this footage of Koen ? This is on your shoulders . You withheld the sap from me twice . It 's the only thing that can stop him . Careful , Waruu , I 'm the only ally you have . Well , it 's not doing me much good right now , is it ? - We will find Koen , overpower him . - It 's too late . You 've been distracted , unfocused , keeping things from me . Let 's talk about deception , Waruu . When were you going to tell me the Hairy essence works in you ? Or did you think I wouldn 't notice ? Don 't push me . I can ruin you any time I want . You just remember who I am now . What I can do . Jarrod . I 'm sorry to disappoint you , but the hair you brought in , nothing unusual there at all . It belongs to a healthy specimen of human . I see . Um ... I mean , are you absolutely sure ? You know our DNA equipment is stateoftheart . - Is there any value in retesting ? - Waste of time . We don 't have to be afraid anymore . The Inclusion Initiative will give us a real opportunity for humans and Hairies to live peacefully , side by side . The initiative means Hairies are no longer a threat to humans . The Hairies can live freely and safely in an open , assimilated society . So , just you today or is your family here ? Most of them . Suspected escaped subhuman sighted . Abandoned building on Mansfield Road . Clear . Subhumans considered armed and dangerous . Shoot to kill . Shoot to kill . You don 't have the right to speak our language anymore . You disobeyed us , Jarli . You put us all at risk . You must leave . When my generation becomes the leaders ... things will change . They have to . I will find our people and I will take back our land from the humans ! You won 't be doing that as a Bindawu ! Now ! The two most important people have been taken from me because of you . Because I trusted you . I shouldn 't have lied to you . I 'm sorry . Don 't . Did he hurt you ? Where is Latani ? She wasn 't processed . What do you mean she wasn 't processed ? I don 't know , OK ? I 'm trying to find out . You were scared of her . She should have been scared of you . What ? No one moves like you . How does this all work ? - It 's all this . - No , it 's not . You shouldn 't do that . Feed your doubt . I don 't need another shrink session . I 'm just saying . What was that about ? Nothing . Charlotte . Thank God . Are you alright ? Darling , come and sit down . Did they hurt you ? The baby ? This is ... incredible . Well , there 's ... nothing like this anywhere else on the planet . But we should get you home , darling . You look exhausted . I 'll organise the doctor for you . - Jarrod ... - A full checkup . I 'm not staying . - What ? - All this has to stop . You 're here to fight their cause ? What you 're doing is completely unacceptable . Can 't you see that ? You 're speaking from a place of ignorance . No , I 'm speaking from a place of common decency and compassion , which is more than you 've ever ... Charlotte ... don 't . - Charlotte ! - No ! No , Jarrod ! - Shh . - Jarrod , no . We need to get that baby out of you for both of your sakes . God , no . Shh , shh , shh . Charlotte ! - Shh , shh , shh . - No , don 't you take my baby ! No , not my baby ! - No ! - It will be alright . Shh , shh , shh . - Jarrod , no . Please , please don 't . - No . When you wake up it will all be over and you 'll wonder what all the fuss was about . Shh . Shh . What have you done ? No . - Do you want to find your mother ? - My mother ? I 'll find your mother and everyone else they locked up . Dolan says he 's hacking the system . Deactivating the tag . Denied . Secure ID not applicable to this order . Dolan 249 , right ? Yeah , just doing a favour for a mate . I was so scared . I know . But I 'm here now . You know that , don 't you ? - I love you . - I love you too . That 's my girl . Allow the powers to come through . Dolan !

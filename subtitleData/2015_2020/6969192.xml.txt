 Previously on The Handmaid 's Tale ... You haven 't asked for your napkins yet this month . We 're all so hopeful . Fred and I tried for so long . It was hard to keep faith , but here you are . You 're my miracle . I 'm out of town next week , but when I get back then we 'll have to have a rematch . I 'll check my schedule . See if you can squeeze me in . No ! Stop ! Mrs. Waterford , this is state business . She 's pregnant ! I just wanted to check if you were okay . I 'm fine . I should 've just driven away with you . Mrs. Waterford , I 'm not pregnant . I got my period . You will stay here , and you will not leave this room . Do you understand me ? Things can get much worse for you . Luke said she was missing it . He said we should wake her up . Her little hand was all sticky from the cotton candy . I can 't do this . It 's dangerous . If I let myself fall in too far , I won 't ever get out . I 've been banished to my room . Thirteen days so far . My door is unlocked . It doesn 't even close all the way . A constant reminder of who 's in control . There are things in this room to discover . I am like an explorer , a traveler to undiscovered countries . That 's better than a lunatic , lost in her memories . Words . It 's Latin , I think . Someone wrote it . In here , where no one would ever see it . Was it Offred ? The one who was here before ? It 's a message , for me . Hey . You there ? I got it out of the toilet . It 's pretty sharp already . Oh . Good . What ? It 's just we 'll be posted soon . Posted . You sound like Aunt Chlamydia . We 're gonna get out of here . So ? Posted could be worse . It sounds like some sort of forced surrogacy or something . That 's just what Alma heard . She 's a drama queen . We don 't know anything really yet . I can guess . We get the turkey baster full of old-man jizz , shoved up our twats so we can maybe pop out a baby for the Fatherland . Sounds awesome . What are you doing ? You spell " Aunt Lydia " with a " y , " right ? Oh , God , don 't do that . What ? I like to read when I take a dump . If they catch you writing , you will lose a hand . You know that . It 's not worth it . Yeah , it is . And once we get out of here , there 's gonna be a girl that comes in here and reads it . It will let her know she 's not alone . Moira ! Time 's up ! Just a second , Aunt Elizabeth . Just having my monthly woe . Let 's go ! Bye . You had to be brave to do this . So , whatever it means , thank you . - You were up early . - Work . Is it the UN ? Well , give it a month . They 'll have to lift the embargo if they don 't want the Euro to collapse . An Aunt escaped last night , from the Needham Red Center . Well , the Eyes will catch her . She crossed the border . Gave an interview to the Toronto Star . It 's already up on their website . - What does it say ? - You can imagine . Lies and hyperbole , everything in the worst possible light . I would expect more from an Aunt . Just me being naive , I guess . Have Fortenberry send in a written response . The important thing is not to discredit what she said , but we need to discredit her . You don 't need to worry about this . I promise . We 've got good men working on it . Praised be . - Good morning , Rita . - Commander , sir . Ma 'am . Blessed day . - Rita ? - What 's wrong with you ? You scared the shit out of me . I 'm sorry . What were you doing in there ? I ... I was ... I was getting dressed . And I think I just , I felt light-headed , you know ? I guess I might 've passed out . Are you sick ? No . No , I ... I feel fine . I really wouldn 't want to worry anyone , you know ? Okay . What did she do this time ? She was on the ground , ma 'am . She said she fainted . - She fainted ? - No , that 's what she said . She was on the ground . Should I make an appointment at the doctor ? No . She 'll be fine . Yes , ma 'am . We do have the Ceremony tonight . - Make an appointment . - Yes , ma 'am . Well . Duty calls . The doctor 's office is on the other side of town . That 's a whole hour each way , if I walk slow . An hour of outside and rain and flowers and fresh fucking air . You 're sick . Is that right ? I fainted , Mrs. Waterford . All right . Come on , then . The car is out front . No , I can ... What ? You can what ? I can walk . It 's not too far . Don 't be stupid . You 're sick . Now come . All right , girls . Settle down . A bit higher , Janine . That 's better . Now , girls . Soon you will be leaving us for new homes , a new family . And they won 't judge you for your looks , or your clothes , or your ability to sound clever . Take your hands out of your mouth ! They will love you for the blessing only you can provide . So , what , is this , like , practice for labor ? - I mean , if we get pregnant ? - Helen ! We raise our hand . These poses are similar to the ones we will take during childbirth . But today we are practicing for the Ceremony . The Ceremony is a sacred ritual . A wonderful ritual . Once a month , on fertile days , the Handmaid shall lie between the legs of the Commander 's wife . The two of you will become one flesh , one flower , waiting to be seeded . We 're flowers . Lay down . What ? It 's nice . Now , if the girls behind could hold the wrists of the girls in front . Moira ? Are you saying that we will be having intercourse with the men between the wives ' legs ? When Rachel saw that she bear Jacob no children , she said unto Jacob , " Give me children , or else I die . " And Rachel said , " Behold my maid , Bilhah , go in unto her , and she shall bear upon my knees , that I may have children by her . " That is His word , dear . And we shall abide . All right , girls , back in your positions . This is fucked . Waterford ? Waterford . You know what to do . Doctor will be right in . Raining cats and dogs out there . Well , it 's good for my tomatoes . I 'm growing heirlooms this year , mostly yellow Valencia . So , I hear you fainted . - Yes . - Okay , well , your pressure 's fine . Do you have any other symptoms ? Dizziness , stomach pains ? Double vision ? - No . - That 's good . According to your chart , it 's Ceremony night . Yes . Well , fainting isn 't uncommon on Ceremony nights . How are the Waterfords ? Are they treating you okay ? Yes , they treat me very well . You know , you can talk to me . I can 't do much about your situation , but I 'm a good listener . All right , then . While you 're here , I might as well have a quick look , make sure that everything is in fighting shape for tonight . This might feel a bit cool . Just relax . You 're ripe . Right on schedule . It doesn 't really matter . Waterford 's probably sterile . Most of those guys are . Sterile . That 's a forbidden word . There 's no such thing as a sterile man anymore . There 's only women who are fruitful and women who are barren . I can help you . It could be the only way for you . If Waterford can 't get you pregnant , they won 't blame him . It 'll be your fault . It 'll only take a few minutes , honey . I can 't . It 's too dangerous . Thank you . That 's a good girl . Mommy loves you . Mommy loves you . Oh , God damn it ! Fuck ! God damn it ! God fucking damn it ! We 're home . Look , I 'm sorry this is happening to you . - I wish ... - You wish what ? What do you wish ? So , are you dying ? Dehydrated . You need to take better care of yourself . Everything is in working order for this evening ? - Yes . - Did he check ? Yes . He checked . Good . Mrs. Waterford , I know I failed you . I ... I disappointed you and myself . And I will do my best to not let it happen again . I 've learned my lesson . I 'm so sorry . Please , let me out . Please . Go back to your room . How did you survive her ? Just please talk to me . Blessed be the pure in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven . Blessed be the pure in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven . Aunt Elizabeth ? One of the toilets is overflowing again . Oh , dear . Don 't make a fucking sound . Anyone see you ? One sound and I push this into your neck . You know I 'll do it , right ? Over here . Over here ! - Please don 't hurt me . - Shut up . Take your clothes off . Hurry up ! Hurry ! Do it , faster ! Sit here . Sit here . Put your arms around the pipe . - Put your arms around the pipe ! - Okay . Please . - I know this wasn 't your idea . - Shut the fuck up . You okay ? Yeah . What ? It 's an eye for an eye , right ? I could shove this down your throat and burn your tongue off . - Or your cunt . - Moira ! Let 's go . Come on . Just remember I didn 't . If it ever comes to that . Help me ! Help ! Shit . Just look meek . Where are you taking this Handmaid ? Open the gate . Yes , ma 'am . Blessed be the fruit . He can 't be in here yet . First is household staff , then the wife , then the Commander . And he knocks . He has to knock . He can 't be in here . Sorry , did I startle you ? I just wanted to say hello . I haven 't seen you in a while . Hello . Hi . I was thinking perhaps we could have a rematch tonight . Scrabble . 9 : 00 in my office ? What do you think ? Well , who 's an early bird today ? Blessed be the fruit . May the Lord open . " And when Rachel saw that she bear Jacob no children , Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob , 'Give me children or else I die . ' " Fred . What are you doing ? Let me help you . Does that feel good ? Don 't . Go back to your room . I 'll be blamed . I 'm not blameless . He tried to talk to me before the Ceremony . He tried to connect . That 's what he needs . You can wet the rim of a glass and run your finger around the rim and it will make a sound . This is what I feel like , this sound of glass . I feel like the word " shatter . " We 've just gotta get to the city . The collective has some safe houses . Where are we ? They probably didn 't take us far . Most of the girls are from the city . Where are the street signs ? Negative . Where are we ? Come on . Stand by , Two . Which track goes to Boston ? We can 't get on the wrong train . Just stay here for a second and I 'll go ask someone . - No ! - Hey , it 'll be fine , right ? I 'm an Aunt . I 'll scare the shit out of them . Blessed be the fruit . Blessed day , under His eye . Could you help me ? Which train goes to Boston ? - That 'd be this track right here . - This track ? Blessed day , miss . Do you need some help ? Yes , thank you . Do you know which train goes to Boston ? It 's coming in now . It 's hard without the signs , right ? They 're going to replace them soon , I think . Where 's your partner ? You shouldn 't be out alone . Can I see your ID card ? Where are you posted ? Moira , you wouldn 't stand for this shit . You wouldn 't let them keep you in this room for two weeks . You 'd find a way out . You 'd escape . Get up . Get your crazy ass up . How was your trip ? Stressful . I was in Mexico to coordinate a trade delegation . Lot of difficult personalities , you have no idea . Maybe I should let you win again . That 's very nice of you , but I prefer a fair fight . Twenty-six . It 's archaic , I think . - Would you like to challenge ? - Sure . Hand me the dictionary . Lower shelf . Did you ever study Latin ? Oh , yes . My parents thought it would help me with the SATs . Here it is . " Sylph , a thin and graceful girl . " You were right . Has she been here ? My predecessor . Knower of Latin . Scratcher of words . Am I not the first he 's invited to this room ? What happened ? Did she say the wrong thing ? Did she displease him , the divine emperor of this house ? And what price did she pay for her insolence ? I 'm sorry . Please . Please , I 'm sorry . Please , please , please . Sorry . The most painful thing is not the betrayal of trust , June . Do you know what 's most painful ? The most painful thing in this entire ugly incident is the ingratitude . Don 't you realize the opportunity you have been given ? Yes , yes , I try to . You were an adulterer , a worthless slut ! But God found a way to make you useful . So , where 's the gratitude ? I 'm sorry . - I 'm sorry . - Shh , dear . I know . God will grant you His forgiveness . But actions do have consequences . Chickens always come home to roost . Aunt Elizabeth . No . No , please ... Please . Please , I 'm sorry . Please . - Please , please , please . - Take off her socks . Back to bed ! You did let me win . Maybe . How about a rematch ? Tomorrow , after the Ceremony . It 's a date . Can you do me a favor ? Sure . Anything ... Within reason , of course . I was just wondering if you could translate something for me . I think it 's Latin . Nolite te bastardes carborundorum . Where 'd you hear that ? Does it mean something ? Not really . It 's a joke . Oh ? How is it a joke ? It 's only funny if you know Latin . Actually , it 's probably only funny if you 're a 12-year-old boy studying Latin . It doesn 't really translate . It 's something like , " Don 't let the bastards grind you down . " Don 't let the bastards grind you down . Thanks . Where 'd you hear it ? From a friend . Did you know her somehow ? What happened to her ? She 's dead . What happened to her ? She killed herself . Hung herself from the ceiling . I don 't know . I suppose she found her life ... Unbearable . And you want ... You want my life to be bearable . I would prefer it . It has been so hard . Being alone in that room all the time . I know Mrs. Waterford is , is trying to teach me a lesson . I know . I know she 's right . I have so many flaws . But it has been so long . I 'm afraid I 'm starting to give up . I certainly wouldn 't want to give up . Like my friend . That would be a tragedy . There was an Offred before me . She helped me find my way out . She 's dead . She 's alive . She is me . We are Handmaids . Nolite te bastardes carborundorum , bitches .

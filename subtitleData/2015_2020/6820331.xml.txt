 Fixed Synced by bozxphd . Enjoy The Flick Acknowledge when in position , sergeant Davis . Dagger team 1 , copy . I keep losing you . - How long till my backup 's here ? - Working on it . Stand by . Say eight to ten minutes . Advise you stay put . I can 't wait for backup . Send them in behind me . Davis , maintain your position . They 're on their way . Dagger team 1 , you seeing this ? There 's some kind of disturbance here . Davis , what is that ? What are you seeing ? What the hell ? Davis . Davis , what 's your status ? Davis , come in ! Got you . ... gonna get a late start . Right , well , it 's a closed session . Most of the specs stayed the same ... Dr. Osbourne , call 204 . Dr. Osbourne , 204 . They 're issuing temporaries for that r and d , as far as I know . Is that part of the same badge or ... ? I 'm pretty sure . - All right . - How 's it going ? - Hey . - Hi . - We 'll get everything . - Marty was already in ? Yeah . And she 's working on that project ? They 'll be done in about a week . I was gonna say ... don Taylor , report to laser laboratory building b , laser lab . Okay , I 'll take a look . - Where have you been ? - Solving problems . You look ... dusty . Sometimes you gotta get dusty , Efrem . - Test the pulse ? - Yeah . Went down to the vault , asked Johnson for some tetracene , but apparently , we don 't store it . It 's outdated and expensive as shit . It got expensive . Back in the ' 90s , it used to be cheap . So , if you look hard enough ... You can still find some lying around . You find a street gang that slings tetracene ? Industrial printer cartridge , $ 14.99 back in the day . - Get me a mount , would you ? - Here you go . Thank you . You gonna tell the suits you 're running this on a 20-year-old part ? I 'll show them it works and say : " That 's the difference between a prototype and a production model . " Okay . Concavity is spun to zero . Lens track is hot . Alignment is keyed in . You are good to go . I 'll let you call it . If you think about the applications on other materials , it could be significant . Metals , for instance , can be shattered with very little effort or noise . Concrete , rubber ... they 're all vulnerable to violent temperature changes . Yeah , this project started as a request from seal team 6 . After the siege in Rwanda , they came to us asking for the capability ... To flash freeze or boil the enemy 's water supply . Now , this device could have driven the enemy out . And you ... tried this on living things ? That wasn 't our intent here , initially . We 'd like you test it . Any volunteers ? Well ... we 'll give it a try . Gentlemen , why don 't we go sit down ? We 'll talk over the next steps . All right ? Yeah . Right this way . What do you want , a clean conscience ? Test it with a slab of beef for all I care . What I want is to use it for what we originally designed it as . A deterrent . Nobody said anything about microwaving people 's lungs . It 's war . It 's the business we 're in . Remember what you sold it to me as when you hired me ? Defense . And that 's still partially true . But war is good business . So is human trafficking . We work for Darpa , Mark . We work for the government . " I don 't know what weapons we 'll use in world war III , - but world war iv will be fought with ... " - " Sticks and stones . " Albert Einstein . - He worked for the government . - Mm-hm . That 's right . And if you ask him , I don 't think he thought that was his finest hour . I 'm sure he has feelings about flash-boiling human flesh . Ever think about prosthetic limbs with full sensory feedback ? Ah . Prosthetics ... don 't win wars . Did you hear that ? That is the empathetic scientist in you dying . Hmm . Did you brief your guys on how to operate the ray ? - I did . - Good . Then you can start packing . Can you be more specific ? Mm-hm . About these goggles . Your ... hyperspectral goggles being deployed by special forces in eastern Europe in the Moldovan war . - I 'm aware . I read the field reports . - No , you have not read this report . Orland called me personally . General Orland . He said things are very ... Sensitive down there . And they 're ... seeing things . Okay . Like what ? They won 't tell me . They won 't share the video feed . They won 't discuss what they 're seeing . They just want the lead engineer down there to advise and consult . Look , you invented these goggles to keep our guys safe . Well , now they need your help . Think of it as defense . Let me reboot the guidance system . It 's locked tight . We have to pull it out . All right , let 's go . Move it out . - Mark Clyne ? - What ? You the guy that designed the helmet cam ? - Yes . Mark Clyne . - James Orland . Come with me . A lot of new boots on the ground here . The country 's in chaos . The insurgency is mostly remnants of the military dictatorship that ran this place until about two months ago . And their popular support is primarily in the north part of the country ... Near the Russian border , and here in the capital . The problem is their forces are well-trained . They 're threatening to turn this whole thing into a civil war . Moldova . Russians had it , lost it . It became independent , but it 's struggling internally . On the one hand , you have an insurgency , made up of the regime 's former elite soldiers . They 're well-trained and dangerous . On the other , you have most of the population , who are tearing down the regime 's flags and demanding a new government . Civil unrest , as complicated as it is , is a business we 're familiar with . We like to think we 're good at it . But this thing your camera found ... It 's a whole new piece of business . I can 't send this video to EUCOM . I 'm just afraid they 'd think it 's a joke . Dod doesn 't have a sense of humor . Typically not . Hook us up . I 'm sure there 's a scientific explanation for what 's on these , but until you tell me , I 'm not sending it up the chain of command . - You done ? - Yes , sir . - Get out . Seal us in . Wait outside . - Sir . Nobody here has been able to make heads or tails of this . It 's thrown a wrench into our entire operation for reasons I 'm not at Liberty to discuss with you . I can tell you we need answers fast . - Do you mind ? - You spotted that quick . Five different helmet cams picked up something similar in the last three weeks . At first , our signals intelligence tech wrote it off as interference . That 's not interference . I don 't think you 'd fly me all the way here for interference . Wanna tell me what you 're thinking ? I want you to tell me what you 're thinking . I don 't know what I 'm thinking ... yet . But there is an explanation . That was the first sighting . Three others just like it . The last was different . It involved a member of delta force , that makes it particularly sensitive . This is Fran Madison with CIA . What special ops does here is done under CIA covert operations . You need to sign this before we go any further . - What is this ? - It 's an sci oath . You 're acknowledging it 's life in prison if you reveal anything you 're told . - Cue up the Davis file , please . - Yes , ma 'am . Three days ago we conducted a raid in mid-city . Our communications were intermittent , and a guy got separated from the group ... Where he ended up killed in action . He got closer than anybody . Too close . Dagger team 1 , you seeing this ? There 's some kind of disturbance here . Davis , what is that ? What are you seeing ? What the hell ? Sergeant Chris Davis . Three-tour combat vet . Best of the best . In the last few weeks we 've been finding bodies around the city that were killed in the same way . The autopsies defied all explanation . Their internal organs were frozen and yet , their skin was burned and corroded . The only response from the allied Moldovan military contact is shock , confusion . And there 's anger . There 's teenagers spray-painting " genocide aratare " at kill sites . - Genocide ... ? - " Aratare . " It 's a local myth . The ghosts of war . " As nightmarish as . " That 's the literal translation . - That 's very poetic . - Well , they 're superstitious . They somehow think ... The horrors of the war have kicked up something unnatural . - We hope you have an alternate theory . - What do you think ? - Think you need a new name for them . - Beyond that . - Give me a copy of the data , some time ... - That 's not possible . You want me to figure this out right now ? - We want your assessment . - I don 't have one yet . Then , I think we have to send our working theory up the chain of command . - I don 't wanna do that . - Okay . What is your working theory ? The agency thinks this is some kind of cloaking technology . Insurgent soldiers wearing active camouflage . In this country ? Something that advanced ? CIA knows a few groups in Europe and Asia could be working on active camouflage . Darpa 's worked on cloaking technology . We 're years away from a prototype . - Maybe somebody beat you to it . - Darpa is the leader in the field . Are you certain of that ? The regime spent heavily on weapons research . Corruption , loose legislation . You 're a military lab and want obscurity ? - This is a great place to work and hide . - Okay . Let 's say it is cloaking technology . - How do you account for cause of death ? - A shock delivered to the victim . I think you 're reaching . Our business requires us to make suppositions . My business requires us to prove them . Your technician 's job is to find glitches , so , he sees glitches . Your job is to find the enemy , so , you see the enemy . Locals believe in spirits , so they see spirits . Everyone is biased , in one way or another . So , my answer to you right now is that we lack data to support any theory . Okay . What do you need to make a more definitive statement ? First , you need a better shot . That 's what I 'm looking for , a better shot . How ? - Right here , sir . - That 's it . I brought this from Darpa . A hyperspectral camera . A more powerful version of the helmet cams your guys are using . It sees deeper into the spectrum of light . Visible or invisible , if something 's there , this 'll pick it up . Can you mount this thing ... On a delta vehicle ? - I don 't see why not . - All right , good . We run missions into the city every day . I 'll put you with our field tech , tell him how to operate it . I wouldn 't put a tech in between this camera and myself . So , you wanna operate it ? If you want that kill shot ... you 'll need a fast reaction time out there . Next mission , you ride with delta . They 're gonna get you close to this thing . You get me the kill shot ... You can go home to Virginia without unpacking . Got a bad rotor , you gotta swap that out . Weld it onto the front panel . Well , well , well . Toll , check that out . - What 's this guy up to , man ? - I don 't know . Believe this guy ? - If it works . - For real . Heard you 're installing a camera on our truck . Which was fine until you ripped out that 50 Cal . You 're taking down a gun to put up a camera ? It 's the only place large enough to mount it . You guys get that , right ? I know it sounds like a terrible idea . We prefer to dance with who brung us ... Dr. Clyne . You get that , right ? " Dance with who brung you " ? No , actually , I don 't . This truck has saved our lives , many times . I understand . You guys know Dr. Clyne 's team built that truck ? Clyne works over at Darpa . I 've worked closely with his group . Been to their facilities in Virginia . - Good to see you , Dr. Clyne . - Good to see you , captain Cabrera . They retrofitted these trucks with tougher , lighter weight armor . They designed the mechanical loaders that do the heavy lifting , so you boys don 't strain yourselves too hard . Matter of fact , Dr. Clyne himself developed the thin weight Kevlar body stocking that literally ... Protects your balls . So , I would think there 'd be nothing but goodwill in this group for Dr. Clyne . - Major sessions . - Captain , have your men fall back . - Get back to it . - Get her done . This is Dr. Clyne . He 's worked with us eight or ten times over the last five years . You ever go out with the assault team ? No , sir . He 's a good man , major . That 's great . I 'm just not a fan of taking tourists on combat missions . Sir , I 'm not a tourist . If you 're not carrying an m4 , you 're a tourist . I 'll carry one , if you 'd like . We gotta get Dr. Clyne out in the field to track the target force and get a kill shot . How long before this equipment 's operational ? A few hours . - Is it gonna work ? - If we get close enough . Let me tell you something . Sergeant Davis ... he got close enough . That 's the best delta that we had . Make sure your equipment is top-notch this time . - They were like brothers . - I get it . Okay . Evening , doc . Hear you two hit it off bigtime . - She can come off a bit intense . - Yeah . So can you . I 'm just here to find this thing . You 're willing to go on a combat mission to find it . She is , too . She 's under a lot of pressure from D.C. They want an answer and it 's her job to give them one . Saw your names on a mission roster . I knew this was a top priority ... But for them to embed you both ... Well , you don 't have to worry about me . I 'm not worried about you , doc . I 'm worried about it . She 's hoping it 's cloaking technology . What do you think it is ? Something no one 's thought of yet . Gentlemen , yesterday at 1800 hours , Utah team left here on a recon mission to Durlesti , when they were engaged by insurgents . We managed to hear most of their chatter during the firefight , but come were unreliable . Target is a five-story apartment building here . We think what 's left of Utah team is being held on the fourth floor , in the northwest corner apartment . We 're gonna be knee-deep in an insurgent-held area . So , we should expect a fight . One last thing . Before our guys were grabbed , they radioed in that they saw what we 're calling hyperspectral anomalies . Your mission is a quick extraction . You get our guys and you get out . However , if engaged , neutralize the anomalies in the area . Neutralize them ? - How ? - Yeah , what are we dealing with here ? We believe these are enemy soldiers in advanced electronic camouflage . - So , be surgical when you fire . - If we don 't really know what they are ... Excuse me ? Would you like to add something ? If they are wearing cloaking technology , you need to bring it back as intact as possible . Dr. Clyne and agent Madison will be on mission with you . Dr. Clyne will be monitoring your helmet-cam feeds from the second MRAP vehicle in the convoy . Major sessions will lead dagger team 1 to do the extraction . Stay on come . Get your gear . - Partner , let 's go . - AJ , front and center . Weapons check , Billy . You got it . Our ride not smooth enough for you ? And you call yourself hard-ass . They really need to repave these roads , man . All right , guys , we 're coming into the abandoned zone . Expect a heavy insurgent presence . Okay . I 've got an insurgent body here . I got Agopia from Utah team . Confirmed KIA . None of these guys appear to have taken any rounds . No entry or exit wounds . Alessio here . Moving to the fifth floor . - We got movement . - Toll , check your 2 o 'clock . Where ? We don 't see anything . - That 's it . Right there . - You 're right on top of it . It 's a motion signature . There 's something under that tub . Lewis , the tub . I want you to flip over the tub . - Toll , I want you on what 's underneath . - I 'm on it . One , two , three . We have Comstock alive and conscious . Repeat . We have sergeant Comstock from Utah team . Hey , buddy . - Where 's the rest of your team ? - They 're upstairs . But they 're all gone . Got under their skin . - What got under their skin ... ? - I saw it . - But ... ? - Blanket . Like a frozen blanket . - Okay , where is the rest of Utah ? - Oh , they 're dead . Yeah , they 're all dead . We 're all dead . - Where are the bodies ? - I told you , they 're on the top floor . Oh , you haven 't seen it . I 've seen it . You know I believe in god , John . This is the opposite of god . Wait . Who 's this ? Can you tell him to turn back ? McFadden , turn back . Give us a view of that room . Nothing 's there . I 'm standing right here . Mac , we 're both staring right at it . It 's in the middle of your view port . What ? That ? It 's a smear . Probably these piece-of-shit goggles . - No , no , no . Tell him to put them back on . - Mac , put the goggles back on . Mac , do it now . - What the ... ? - Take the shot . They went right through it . - Did he miss ? - He doesn 't miss . Major sessions , we have a KIA . McFadden . A hyperspectral target is on the fifth floor , northwest corner . Switch to heavy rounds or 203s . Whatever you have to do to bring this thing down . Tell them to pull out . There ! Get everyone out now ! - Tell them to pull out now . - No , we 're not leaving empty-handed . I guarantee you 're leaving empty-handed . Come on ! Grenade ! - We need support ! - Get out . All units evacuate now . Let 's go . Get back to the truck . This room right here . We can still grab him . Let 's go ! Move ! Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . Go ! Here . Here , Jim . Hold on . Here . Evacuating via south face ! I got Talbot , Comstock , Riedel and Shaire . Five men down ! We gotta travel together and we gotta stay tight . Can you do that ? Oh , Jesus . Go ! Come on . Come on . Move . Move , move . You got him ? Let 's go . Get out of the way . Where ? - Right there ! - Where is it ? In front . We gotta get in . Move . - Help him in . - Come on ! - Get in here ! - In you go . No . No . Go , go ! - Move ! - Get in . - Hey ! - Go , go ! We 're in ! Go ! Hold on , where 's Cabrera ? Where 's the captain ? Talk to me . Did you see him ? - Come on , talk to me , man . - I saw him die . - What ? - I saw him die . - I 'm going home . - Yeah . - I 'm going home . - Hey , hey , hey . It 's okay . Look at me . Look at me . - Did you see it ? - Yeah . - You saw it . How close did you get ? - I was in a room with it for hours . That tub saved my life . I could feel it . - Okay . - I could feel it . Land mines ! Hold on ! Hey , buddy , look at me . No , no , no . Shit . Open the door . Yeah . - Come on . Now , move . - Come on . Both drivers are dead . Archer Lima 2 . Hit a land mine . Both vehicles destroyed . We are ... Three clicks southeast of target building . We are losing your transmission . Your transponders are down . No shit . Our vehicles were just blown to hell . We need to find cover . - I can 't hear what you 're saying . - Clyne , leave the camera . Come on , Clyne . Go , go , go . Move , move . Cover . - Let 's go . - Get up , get up . Come on . Go , go , go . Where you been ? Clear . Who 's injured ? - Diaz ? - I think my ankle 's broke . We need an airlift . I can 't get a signal to base . Keep trying . Com . Get over here . Get over here . Yeah . Archer Lima 2 . Archer Lima 2 . This is dagger team 1 , over . I 'm good . I 'm good . Can they get in that way ? You all right ? Archer Lima 2 , this is dagger team 1 . Do you copy ? Over . Archer Lima 2 , this is dagger team 1 . Do you copy ? Over . Hey . - How you doing ? You 're bleeding . - Hmm ? Okay . You hit your head . You hit your head . Did you black out ? Yeah , I guess so . Major . - She hit her head pretty bad . - Let me see . Pupils are huge . Sir , I 'm sending but they 're not receiving . I 'm hearing a click back as soon as I sign over , but no answer . Keep trying . She 's in shock . Keep an eye on her . Archer Lima 2 , this is dagger team 1 . Do you copy ? Over . Over there . - Thanks . - Yeah . Where 's everyone else ? Where 's the rest of Utah ? I 'm sergeant Chen . I was with Utah . We were the second team in last night . There was eight of us . - Do you have confirmed KIAs for Utah ? - Well , I can tell you this much . Sergeant Comstock won 't be on your Christmas card this year . - You saw insurgents kill Comstock ? - Insurgents ? Is this guy for real ? - What rock were you under ? - I was the radio operator . We lost come . I was stuck in the truck the whole night . - I never saw the active camouflage . - Active camouflage ? Even if there was a such thing , and there 's not ... How does a human wearing active camouflage walk through walls ? Or through three mags of armor-piercing ammo ? I saw pat pump 150 rounds at one of them . This thing 's killed at least 19 of our men . And we have no idea what it is . Clyne . You saw it . What was it ? Human . Had a human form . It looked at me , it was conscious . Like a person . Is there anything that explains what you saw ? No . Let 's pull together all the functional goggles that we have . - My goggles were wasted in the crash , sir . - Yeah . Mine , too . They 're trashed . Forget the goggles . We can 't recharge them anyway . So , what do we do ? How are we supposed to see them ? Maybe that camera can still help us . If we get to an elevated position , we 'd have a better vantage point . Help me with this ? Let 's go . Let 's move out . Move . They 're everywhere . Something 's stopping them . Some sort of black sand . I fell in that sand . - I had to ... pick it out of my hand . - Let me see it . - Little , sharp pieces of metal . - They 're iron filings . - It 's pure iron . - Yeah . And there 's a trail of it ... All the way around the building . It 's a barrier . Someone put it there . I don 't think we 're alone . Let 's stack up and sweep upstairs . Point and shoot ? Point and shoot . Breach ! Breach ! - I 've got kids . - Clear . - Clear . - All clear . Tell them to take the long wall . Ask them where they got this , and who else is here . Ask them if there 's anyone else in the factory , and do they have guns . She says they 're here alone . Only that one gun . No soldiers are here . - No one at all . - Major sessions . - What 's the problem ? - This factory has a transmission tower . It puts out a huge signal . So , what 's the problem ? Everyone within 20 miles will hear our conversation with base . Any insurgent radio will pick up our transmission . Insurgents are the least of your worries . Connect me to general Orland as soon as possible . Archer Lima 2 , Archer Lima 2 , this is dagger team . Do you copy ? Archer Lima 2 , Archer Lima 2 , this is dagger team . Do you copy ? Archer Lima 2 , Archer Lima 2 , this is dagger team . Do you copy ? You guys are our new recruits . And believe me ... we could use the help . Come on , tough guy . Show me what you got . Hey , I need to ask you something . Was it your idea ... To put the barrier ... outside ? Their father . Their father knew . Their father rolled open barrels of the iron shavings around the building . He saved their lives . What happened to your father ? You 're a little scrapper , aren 't you ? Hey , buddy , you all right ? Come on , get up . What are you doing ? Are you a ghost ? Mm . Aratare . - He says , " don 't say that word . " - Ask him what they are . Lost souls . Souls of the dead . They 're trapped between life and death , and they can 't find peace . How 's that happen ? He says , " war . " Come on . If their father put down the iron shavings , he knows more about these things than any of us do . Ask her where her father is . Her brother , Bogdan , doesn 't know . He thinks he went to get help . He died outside , when he was making the barrier . She had to bring him in here . I 'm so sorry . - Okay ? - Yeah . Ceramic tile . Ask her how her father knew about the iron filings stopping the aratare . - What else did he know about them ? - She doesn 't know . " Masarov . " - What is Masarov ? - It 's a place . It 's a district up the river . It 's where it all began . It 's where the aratare killings started . Aratare . I 'm saying we land the helos right here . Extract us from this roof and get us the hell out of here . There are power lines everywhere . The helos would have to fly low and slow . Easy pickings for a teenager with a rocket . Can you get me up to speed ? You spoke with base ? Yeah . The general 's sending in helos to come get us , and tanks to secure the landing zone in an open Plaza - about half a mile from here , at dawn . - That 's a long way on foot . You think we can make it a half a mile ? With kids ? We don 't have an option . Okay ? All the roads are either blocked or mined . And since we used the tower to talk to base , everyone knows where we are . We gotta move out . You wanna go running around with those things roaming the streets ? Even though we have no way to fight them ? Better than waiting for them to find a way in . The only reason we 're still alive is that barricade out there . Eventually they 're gonna get through . It 's just a matter of time . - Wait . - We have to take our chances . - This is the best plan that we have . - Major . What if I said I can improve our chances of making that Plaza ? - I 'm listening . - Take a look around you . Everything in this building ... Is filled with this . Iron dust . And the iron stops the hyperspectrals . Exactly . Weaponize it . - Dirty bombs . - Best idea I 've heard all night . Let 's collect the grenades . Clyne . I need you to be our eyes out there . - Can you haul that camera on foot ? - I 've got a better idea . This camera already projects the right wavelength of UV light . If I can turn it inside out , by reversing the polarity of some of the components , I might be able to turn it from a camera into a searchlight . We 'll be able to see them with our own eyes . - That 'd be a game-changer . - Think I can talk to the convoy ? I 'll them how to do the same with their equipment . When they come get us , they 're gonna need eyes , too . I 'll connect you to the main engineer back at base . Copy that . They 're ready to equip their vehicles with whatever you need . Can you repeat the whole request back to me , please ? Okay , yes . That 's correct . What you need is a device that emits a very short wavelength of light . I can tell you exactly how to rewire that . Do you have anything you can mount on a tank ? We got movement across the alleyway . Guys , we got movement . Can we get eyes on it ? Hey , guys , stand clear for a second . - What 's the word on the convoy ? - Last contact was 50 minutes ago . They 're on their way to the extraction point . Here they come ! Get your gear . We 're leaving this building in 15 seconds . Okay , come on . Let 's go . That was the fastest way to the extraction point . - Yeah . - Hey . She says she can show us another way . Talbot , you 're with Clyne . Diaz , you 're on point . Let 's go . Yup . Moving . Okay , let 's go . Come on . Come here . Everybody 's accounted for . - It looks clear . - Let 's move . Come here . Okay . She says , " go right , here . " Hey . Heads up , 6 o 'clock . - Move ! - Move ! Move ! They 're coming . Come on . Come on . Watch out ! Oh , shit . - Come on , Lewis ! Let 's go ! - I think it 's working ! - In here ! - This way . Move , move . Go ! Go ! - Move it ! - Come on . - Pick up ! - Get up . - I 'm good . - Go ! Go ! Steady your gun ! - Get down ! - Take cover , man . Come on , doctor . Come on . Incoming ! I got a man down ! Man down ! Run ! - Moving it up ! - More on that side ! Hurry . She says , " straight ahead , under the archway . " Watch yourself . - Hold it . - She says this is the place . Go , go . Looks clear . - Where are they ? - Get on the bus . Go . Where 's the rescue ? Where 's the light ? Come on . Come on , come on . Work . Work . Work . Come on . It 's okay . You sure this is the place ? - Yeah . - Ask them if they 're sure . She said , " I 'm pretty sure . " Major . This thing is dead . We can 't see them . We 're blind . - That 's us . - This is the landing zone . - Commander , are you seeing this ? - Those are the targets . - Go ! Go ! Go ! - Go ! - Go , go , go . - Let 's go . Move . Go on . On the ground . Fire . Get down ! - Move on my command . - Move it out ! Hey ! Hey ! Overhead ! Let 's get to the tanks ! Move it to the tanks ! - Move it ! - Move ! Move ! - Open fire ! - Let it go ! - Get back ! - No . Get back ! Left flank ! Your six ! - Where are they ? - I don 't know ! - Where 's Bogdan ? - Where 'd he go ? - Who 's got him ? - Do you see them ? We 'll find you ! - Bogdan ! - Bogdan ! Get him ! Bogdan ! Bogdan ! - Bogdan ! - Get back here ! Get back here ! - Come on ! - Come on . - Take her . - Get up . Help her ! Save her ! I got her . Let 's go . Come on ! - Get up . Come on . - Dr. Clyne , come on ! - Get in ! - Okay . Major . General Orland . General , go for sessions . Base has been lost ! - We 're sending you to our refugee bunker ! - Yes , sir . Hey , where are we going ? Base is that way . - We 're not going to base . - Why not ? It 's been compromised . Hey , they 're spreading through the streets . They 're everywhere . - They just gonna leave us here ? - There 's more people to airlift . - What is this place ? - Entrance is over here . Open the door ! Open the door ! Get back ! Put your weapons down . Put your weapons down ! Do it now ! He 's saying , " safe inside . " Hey . Okay . It 's okay . Stay close . Hey , hey , hey . Look at me . Look at me . She 's not okay . Come here . I 'm gonna need some room . It 's okay . It 's okay . - What the hell happened to base ? - Base got overrun . - The general is meeting us here . - So , what is this place ? We 're in a civilian refugee shelter . This bunker has 20 feet of concrete and steel . Are we safe here ? I have no idea . But there 's food and water . Talbot , gather what you can . Toll , Chen , head back to the entrance . There 's a com center . See who you can reach . Alessio , you 're with me . Let 's go . - There . - Where ? - There . - Right over there . - Okay . - On the bed . You 're okay . Shh . You 're gonna be okay . - What happened ? - It 's her shoulder . - Her shoulder has shrapnel in it . - We 're gonna cut open her sleeve . Get the iv line ready . This is yours . Now , I need your help , sari , to stop the aratare . I need to know what your father knew . What did your father do ? He worked with ceramics . What did he make ? He made containers . He made containers for Masarov . The power plant where the aratare came from . Let 's get the mask on her . Okay , we have to take her now . - This is the U.S. armed forces ! - Open it . Lower your weapons . - How many are you ? - Not many . Let 's give them a hand . Let 's go . Bring as much as you can . The base was overrun . It was like a wave . Invisible . Men just started falling . Our conventional weapons were useless . I requested an order to evacuate the base ... But our long-range come are completely scrambled . So , I took all the gear I could . I started sending units north out of the area of operation . Kept five aircraft with the least amount of fuel , stayed behind with one platoon . Out of the 240 of us , we have 19 remaining . Did you get a message to higher command ? No . - Is there a rescue mission planned ? - No . We intercepted radio chatter from Moldovan friendlies to find this place . We sent that bird to pick you up and bring you here . If you 'd even tried to return to base , you 'd be dead . We 're the last U.S. forces in the country ? I hope so . So , what 's the plan , sir ? Came here to regroup , major . There 's no plan . - I recommend we fortify the entrance . - Fortify with what ? - We wait till a rescue mission ... - Fortify with what ? They 'll come through whatever you use . - We need to take our chances on a helo ... - There 's 20 minutes of flight time ! Twenty minutes of flight time in those birds . Not more ! There 's not enough room for all of us anyway . We need to form teams and take the aircraft . But where you gonna go , major ? You can 't run from them . You can 't stop them . Your weapons are useless . We have no idea what they are ! If they come through that door , we 're sitting ducks . We can 't stop them ! We can 't stop them ! Take what we can and go . I know what they are . I know what they are . I know what they are . We think we 're seeing things . We think it can 't be real , but it kills . So , it is real . It 's something . It 's not light , it 's not shadow , or some trick of the mind . Pass through walls , check . Outside the visible spectrum , check . Kills to the touch , check . Comstock . He was under a ceramic bathtub , is that right ? Tank armor . It couldn 't pass through tank armor . M1 Abrams tank armor , that 's ceramic plating everywhere . It cannot pass through ceramic . You know what that means ? It means this stuff isn 't natural . Someone made it . It 's man-made . Man-made how ? Okay . You have solid , liquid , gas . Lava can turn into rock . Ice can turn into water . Metals can melt . These are natural states . But there are unnatural states . Artificial states , man-made states . Condensate . Bose-Einstein condensate . A state of matter that was predicted by Nath Bose and Albert Einstein . It has some very unusual properties . It can be slowed down by iron filings . It cannot pass through ceramic , but it can pass through walls . It 's so cold it will kill you instantly on contact . It can do everything we 've been seeing here . To create Bose-Einstein condensate , you need power , and you need a lot of it . Masarov . The power plant . Yes , Masarov . Where they were made . You said this country was pouring billions into weapons research . This is a weapon . - And it was set loose , or it broke loose . - All right , but these things climb . They 're like humans . It looks like a person . So can marble and Clay in the right hands . And I wanna know why . Why they look like people . I can 't tell you how they did this . What I can tell you ... Is that someone made them . If someone made them , they don 't escape the laws of the world . Nothing does . It shines light on new laws , and that 's what we have to learn . - They have order and structure . - They can be broken down . Anything can be . It 's just energy . And since I know what they are , - I can build the right weapons . - What kind of weapons ? Plasmic-discharge . They can tear apart the condensate . - Where will we find weapons like that ? - We 're gonna build them . - Build them with what ? - Anything we can find in this bunker . Anything with electronics . Optics , ballistic casings . All the gear you brought from base . We can take it all apart , and I can build an arsenal . And then we can go to Masarov and stop this before it goes any further . Because if we don 't , the condensate will feed on all the energy in its path . It 'll grow exponentially . There 's no limit to how far they can spread . Unless we stop them . Let 's get this gear inside , guys . Come on . Let 's move ! Same number each side . All right , let 's go , boys ! Any med patches in there ? We got three of them over here . It 's a ground-to-air tracking scope . We can use this . They have good optics . - Good . This is good . - Two more over there . See that 305 ? Half of these are labeled " defective . " We need a voltage counter . I want you to start testing these . All right , open it up . Get that one open . Pop it . Is that what I think it is ? We got the lotus from base . That 's badass . - Looks like a mechanical rottweiler . - Look at that . Clyne 's making a few changes . They 're taking down a chain hoist and putting up a searchlight . Déjà vu . - What does it fire ? - It 's a focused energy pulse . If my math is right ... It should break down condensate . Masarov . The single largest power plant in the region . It 's where the killings started . If they 're man-made , they were made here . It 's less than ten clicks from here . Our birds can make that , but ... it 's probably one way . I 've been digging for clues with the civilians . I found intel on Masarov . It 's been retrofitted several times over the last decade by the central regime . It 's got " weapons research " written all over it . Okay , you and Clyne need to be embedded to infiltrate . It 's up to the both of you to figure out how to stop this . We have to create a diversion . We 'll draw them out here so you can infiltrate the structure and try to find the source . Clyne 's predicting the charge from these will be extremely hot . Enough to destroy condensate . We 'll find out soon enough . All right , boys . This is it . If you have any last words ... Now 's the time . All right , listen up . You are using untested weapons ... Against an enemy that , to this point , has been unstoppable . Now , you are heading into unknown territory . And hear me when I say you 're gonna see things you will not understand . Our enemy has spread through the city in a matter of days . There 's no telling how far they will spread ... Unless we fight back . Most men never even come close ... To changing the future . This is the place . And now is the time . Make no mistake , you 're the last line of defense . Let 's go do what we came here to do . Let 's go , let 's go ! One minute . Thirty seconds . Spearhead 1 , proceed with descent . All right , let 's go . Here we go . Let 's move ! We have a visual . Hostile target gathering at 12 o 'clock on east end of platform . Move , move ! We are a go . I have a confirmed spectral kill . We 're a go . I say again , all units go . - Let 's show them what we 've got . - Come on . - This is it ! - Let 's do it ! Let 's go . Drop . Copy , spearhead 1 . All units engage . Spearhead 2 taking north peninsula . Spearhead 3 beginning descent over south peninsula . At least a dozen targets coming out . - Go ! Go ! - Let 's move ! - On me ! - All units , you are clear to engage . - Move in ! - Move it ! Lock and load . - Move out . - Let 's move . Right behind you ! Weapons free ! Weapons free ! Let 's go . Move up ! - Move ! - Come on ! - I said go , go , go ! - Move ! Spearhead 2 , you 're go for infield . Proceed to insertion point . Go , go , go ! Get down ! Right there . - Toll ! - Go ! Go ! Go , go , go ! Go , go , go ! - Somebody get on top ! - Down right there ! - We got more incoming ! - Keep formation ! Let 's move it ! Fight ! Fight ! Move ! - Let 's go , go , go ! - Go , John ! Do we have a sit-rep ? Right now . Clyne , what 's the situation down there ? Sessions , we got split up . - We 're still looking for the lab . - We 're holding . Don 't know how long . - Do you copy ? - Can you hear me ? Sessions ? We gotta keep going . We gotta be close now . God . Look over here . Bose-Einstein condensate . Look at these x-rays . They were scanning people . On a molecular level . And printing them out of condensate . It 's an assembly line . Like some kind of ... Industrial process . You 're right . It 's a weapon . What happened here ? It looks like a catastrophic failure . Half the cells are broken and empty . Some structural failure must have set them free . Opened up Pandora 's box . Now what ? Incoming ! Hey ! Hey , 12 o 'clock ! - Do it ! - They 're coming back ! - They 're moving ! - All eyes on target . - One of them is reforming . - Bring it down ! " Top research advisers of the central regime . " This man was trying to stop it . They did lose control . Can you translate this ? It 's an emergency shutdown procedure . Half these words I 've never seen . What about the other half ? " Decouple ... decouple procedure . Disconnect the umbilicals to , uh ... Interrupt the ... neural activity . " - Okay . - So , you gotta unlock all these ports . And then you gotta pull this bracket here to release all the cables . And then ? That should stop them . Take this . Come on ! Get up ! Right there ! There 's more ! Another one ! Got it right there ! - Clyne ! - I know ! What the hell ? I did them all . Nothing 's happening . Clyne ! Pull the bracket ! In the middle ! No ! No ! - Is it over ? - I don 't know . Can you walk ? - I 'm all right . - Come on . We have to find a way out . - Do you hear that ? - Yeah . This is it . They weren 't just scanning people . They 're not just printouts . This is what 's controlling them . These are from real corpses . Each one is made from a real person . They 're alive ? They 're not alive . They 're not dead . They 're just trapped somewhere in between . But they are in pain . How do you know ? This is pain . But how do you know they can feel ? I can 't prove it . I can 't . So , maybe there are things science can 't answer . No . Wait , no . This is why we came here . This is the evidence . This is why you came , remember ? Remember ? So many people have died . You said it . - You said , " I wanna know why . " - I know enough . You have to think about the bigger picture . I am . Help them off single file . Got more coming in ! Put them in unit 5 . - Over here . Over here . - Watch his neck . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm okay . Give me your hand . Right there , sir . Welcome back . You okay ? New survey teams . They 're gonna take Masarov apart piece by piece . Measure everything . Try to reverse-engineer it . Fight over ownership . I 've been asked if you wanna go back out there . I said I 'd ask , but ... I 've seen what I came to see . They don 't stop , do they ? I don 't think they know how . I told you you 'd go home to Virginia without unpacking . Delta unit , move out . Thank you .

 Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons ... rage ... grief ... fear . My God . Now , in order to survive , we must battle our most dangerous adversary ... the enemy within . Why do we need these amethysts ? They power the dome . If we bring the amethysts above ground , I 'm hoping we can recharge . Christine has some sort of a schematic in her office . I don 't know what it 's for , but those amethysts are definitely a part of it . You think you can plant the explosives and get out in time ? Yeah , not a problem . Guys , go ! My mom sacrificed herself so that her child could live . You set off those bombs , didn 't you ? The actions of this resistance have threatened our very survival . We need to kill them all . Really open to suggestions here . These seven geometric shapes on the schematic could be the amethysts that were in the tunnels . This is serious . We hit the kinship hard . They 're gonna come at us with everything they 've got . Carolyn said that the amethysts were important to the kinship 's survival . That 's why Christine wanted them dug up . I 'm not feeling great . Do you mind ? Of course . We got this . She 's taking Carolyn 's death pretty hard . We all are . All right , one ... two ... three . - All right , muzzles down . Anything ? - All clear . All clear . - Upstairs ? - Nah , upstairs clear . Where the hell are they ? Norrie 's not the only one creeped out we 're in a funeral home . This could mean anything . The only person who can tell us what this design means is Christine . Torch the place . Hunter , focus on cracking the password on Christine 's recorder . Maybe we 'll find an answer there . John to Yoko . George and Ringo just torched the Aktaion house . Looks like Christine 's out for blood . We can figure out our next move when you get back . Yeah , copy that . What do you mean they weren 't there ? Well , they knew we were coming . My bet is they 're no longer on the island . - They could be anywhere . - We 'll find ' em . Julia and Jim will pay for what they did . Tell Eva I 'll be home soon . Oh , no . Oh , no , I 'm not ready yet . Christine ? Christine , what is it ? What 's wrong ? It 's nothing . Here , let me help . Here . Here . Let me see . Let me ... - Christine , what is this ? - Eva . Remarkable . It 's happened . What are you doing ? You 're pregnant . 3x09 - Plan B I 'm sorry about this place . Jim thought no one would ever look for us here . I get it . It 's just ... a lot . Norrie , if I 'd known that you and Joe , or Carolyn , were down in those tunnels , I never ... It 's not your fault . It 's Christine 's . And she 's to blame for all of this . I promise you , your mother 's death won 't be in vain . I didn 't want to leave her . She was in so much pain . But at least she didn 't die as one of those things . Because , even if it was just for a few minutes I had my mom back . If you need anything , I 'm here , okay ? Okay . Julia ? If there 's any chance to get Barbie back , the real Barbie you have to take it . How is this possible ? We only slept together yesterday . You 're carrying the new queen . This isn 't any ordinary pregnancy . What 's with the guards ? Everything okay ? I 'll leave you two alone . What 's happening ? Remember right before we woke up from the cocoon world ? - Right . - We were in the hospital . Yeah . You 're pregnant ? It 's a girl . I mean ... Okay , okay . Christine 's certain , but I don 't ... All right , sit down . But what 's with the guards ? It 's a precaution . Big Jim and Julia ... they could be anywhere , - and she might ... - Listen to me . Nothing is going to happen to you or this baby . Understand me ? You leave Julia to me . I still can 't figure it out . Happy to report all the bees are back in Christine 's bonnet . Just don 't get too comfy . Eventually , we 're gonna have to move again . We 're at war . - You said we 'd be safe here . - Yeah , I did . I 'm also student of history , and , at war , always have an exit strategy . Guys ... you got to hear this . You cracked the password ? So , I rewound to the beginning . This is Christine 's first entry . It 's a shame we 'll never meet , but these recordings are meant to guide you , to help you and your parents , Barbie and Eva , usher in a new generation ... the next kinship ... with you as its queen . Barbie and Eva , they 're supposed to ... Have a baby ? That 's been Christine 's plan from the start ? It was my idea to bring the amethyst here . It 'll be guarded at all times . Good work , James . We can 't afford to let anything happen to it . I just wish I could have stopped Big Jim . I 'll keep searching , I 'll find the Resistance and kill them . Spare Joe . But he 's just as guilty as the rest of them . With only one amethyst remaining , adjustments will have to be made , and I need Joe 's help . What about Sam ? I went back to the bomb shelter . He wasn 't there . I gave Sam a choice : He can either live among us , or ... die with the Resistance . Christine ? I thought the cocoon healed you . It did . Where are you going ? The dome wall . I need to see it . You don 't have to be here , if you don 't want to be . No . Keeping my mind busy helps . What the hell is this thing supposed to be anyway ? I think these oscillating lines are sound waves ? In that cocoon world , I learned how sound can be used as energy . I just don 't remember how . Ever hear of a library ? They 're filled with these things called books . You read ' em once in a while , and they tend to answer your questions . You want us to go to the library on a mission ? Well , if it keeps us one step ahead of Christine , you 're damn straight . She said she had a way to bring the dome down . I didn 't , didn 't , I didn 't believe her . Seeing that thing , I think maybe she was telling the truth . - We 'll get our stuff and go . - Hey , listen , guys ... none of those bastards can know we 're here , you understand ? Yeah . Anything ? I 'm writing everything down ... about halfway through . Safe to say , she 's not your biggest fan . Yeah , well , feeling 's mutual . What ? Me ... I 'm in a wheelchair listening to a diary while people are trying to kill us . Not exactly pulling one 's weight . Look ... that recorder and then those Aktaion files were coded , so that means they 're important . I couldn 't hack that . I 'm pretty sure Julia , Norrie and string bean couldn 't have , either . So , without you , we don 't know what Christine knows . That 's pulling your weight . Thanks , man . I don 't get why everyone thinks you 're such a giant tool . Shut the hell up and feed my dog . Not too close to the window . I know . Every time I think this can 't get any worse , it does . You know there 's still time to stop Christine . No mommy , no daddy , no baby . You want to kill Eva and Barbie ? What part of " usher in a new generation " did you not understand ? No . Not while there 's still a way to save Barbie . You mean the same Barbie who just burned down a house trying to find us ? That Barbie ? There 's no way to reach Barbie . Or my son . They 're just gone . Hunter , Carolyn ... they were taken over by the Life Force , but fought their way back . Yeah , I tried that emotion stuff with Junior . It didn 't work . Maybe that 's because we were only half right . Norrie just told me that after the explosion hurt Carolyn , she became human again . What if physical pain suppresses the Life Force , allowing emotion to overcome it ? What if you 're wrong ? We do it your way . I 'll drink to that . Julia , you copy ? Julia ? I 'm here . God , it is so good to hear your voice . What do you want ? I just want to see you . You have been right all along . There is something wrong with me . Eva 's really messing with my head . Meet me out by the Soderquist farm . Just you and me . I 'll be there in an hour . Your gun ! Toss it in the woods . I 'm just here to talk . Do it , or I 'm gone . All right . I 'm here . Yesterday , when you asked me ... if I loved Eva , I didn 't know what to say . I have not been able to get that question out of my head . And that 's when everything ... when you , me , Eva ... that all became clear . I realized that whatever I felt for her ... it isn 't real . - Barbie ... - Christine and Eva were using me , and I am so , so sorry that I couldn 't see that . For not believing you . It 's really you . You 're back . I missed you so much . We have got to stop them . Christine is crazy . But I think I can get close enough to her to end this . I wish you hadn 't have done that . What did you do ? It 's for your own good . Nice work , Dexter . Help me get him back to the cabin . Oh , no . It 's begun . The dome 's surface is calcifying . Soon every living thing won 't be able to breathe unless I can bring down the dome with Joe 's help . I don 't understand . How is what 's happening to the dome making you weaker ? Because I 'm connected to it . And with the egg destroyed and one remaining amethyst , the dome has no power source . It 's shutting down . Christine ? Christine ! You recognize this place , don 't you ? Julia , what the hell ? It 's where you murdered my husband . Come on . You got this all wrong . I 'm not like Christine and Eva anymore . Whatever was in me ... it 's gone , I swear . Well , that almost sounded convincing . Almost . Except for the knife hidden in your boot . What the hell is he doing here ? He 's gonna help me fight whatever 's inside of you . - It 's probably gonna hurt . - Okay , Julia . Come on . Think about what you 're doing . Please don 't do this ! - It 's okay . Let me see . Let me see . - Junior ... No , don 't . What can I do ? This . No . No more . Barbie ? Barbie , focus on my voice . Think about everything that we 've been through . I know you can fight this . Julia ... That 's it . That 's it . I 'm right here . I knew it . I 'm sorry . But the two of you , working together that is priceless . There 's just one problem ... with your whole plan here . You 've lost . I 'm part of the kinship now . And I 'm with Eva . And nothing you do ... is gonna change that . She 's having my baby . You two didn 't know ? Spoiler . Though , in all fairness ... I just found out this morning . So , hey , go ahead , use your new pal here to torture me all you want , because every time you do , all it does is remind me how much I don 't want you in my life anymore . What are you doing ? He 's right . It 's over . - It 's too late . - No . There is still time . Hey , Jim , you wouldn 't happen to have any parenting tips ? Would you ? 'Cause you did such a great job with Junior . Shut up . Why do you think he was the first one to fall in line with the kinship anyway ? Jim ! - Junior 's weak . - Or ... he saw you ... for what Julia is now so willing to look past . That you are a sad ... pathetic ... cold-blooded killer . Jim , that 's enough . What the hell are you doing ? The plan was to suppress the Life Force in Barbie , not kill him . We 've been doing this for hours . He 's toying with us . You think I don 't see that ? He 's trying to pit us against each other . You really think he and Eva got a cosmic bun in the oven ? - Who knows anything anymore ? - Well , this pain thing 's not working . Time to do things my way . No , I am not giving up on Barbie . I know that I can do this , all right ? - I just need to do it alone . - And you 're willing to do whatever it takes ? Just give me more time . - Here . - What 's this ? Back up . Indy wouldn 't let Christine anywhere near him . If you can 't change Barbie back , he 'll know . What are you gonna do ? Plan B. All right , it should be down here . What about The Truth Hertz , A Fun Guide to Sound ? Even books with lame-ass titles could probably tell us something about that sketch . So you think Big Jim is right ... that this is the way to take down the dome ? The military has devices that can immobilize armies using sonar technology . So , yeah , I guess sound could be used as a weapon . But what if it 's not a weapon ? What if it 's , like , a beacon ? Kinship phone home . What are you doing here , Joe ? Get off me ! - Get off me ! Come on ! Come on ! - Joe ! God . - Hurry , Joe ! - Got it ! Come on . - Hey . Hey ! Keep the door open ! - I 've been looking for you two . Open the door ! Your wound . It 's almost healed . These human bodies and their oxytocin are a marvel . I 'm glad you 're feeling better . James ... this is temporary . Everyone , everything has a cycle , and mine is coming to an end . No , but ... I thought you were my mate . What you and I have is beyond mating . But Barbie and Eva , they 're together . I figured that you and I ... Eva and Barbie are special . And so are you , but in a different way . While they 're meant to be with each other , I 've always seen you ... with many mates . Sam , get out of our way now . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm on your side . - Then where have you been ? - I got captured . Christine experimented on me , but I 'm fine . If you go out that door , three Millers are waiting for you . Yeah , he 's right . The back stairs are your only chance . What 's it gonna be ? Let 's go . Where 's your better half ? I 'm not sure . Maybe he went to take a nap , a stroll . Maybe he went to kill Eva . I didn 't ask him . You better stop him , Julia . Big Jim is Big Jim . A killer . But come to think of it , so are you . How many people have you killed ? No one that didn 't have it coming . Like your fellow soldiers ? 'Cause seeing you like this , the reporter in me really has to ask , was it really friendly fire that killed them , or were you just having a really bad day ? That 's low , Julia even for you . You ... have no idea what I am capable of . What about after the army ? Most guys go back to their lives , go back to their families . You became a debt collector ... killing anyone who didn 't pay up . So is that what the kinship wants you to be ? A killer ? What were my husband 's last words ? Did he beg for his life before you shot him ? You know he wanted me to kill him . Or maybe you forced him to sign over those life insurance papers . Was that the plan this whole time ? Kill him , sleep with me , then rob me blind ? And that would 've worked , too , but then the dome came down . Do you even hear yourself ? I know that you are in there , Barbie . The real one . The man who doesn 't let his dark past define the man he wants to be ! Eva , the kinship , they want you to be the man that you were . Not the man who owns his mistakes so that he can move past them and be a better man . That 's the man I fell in love with ! It 's simple , Barbie : Eva is your past , and I 'm your future . So you fight for that future . You fight for me , and you fight for yourself ! Can ... Can I please ... have some water ? When Dale returns from killing Julia , send him to my room . Slowly , slowly ... Thank you . I need you to know , I never wanted it to come to this . Yeah ... I know . You always want to see the best in other people . And that 's just ... so ... incredibly ... massively ... annoying . Who hooks up with the guy that kills her husband , anyway ? And you think that there 's something wrong with me ? I know this isn 't you . No , see , that 's where you 're wrong . The real me is the person that you refused to see the day that we met . And just like a good soldier , I knew exactly where to attack my enemy at her weakest . I 'm not the enemy . Caroline would disagree with you . That was an accident . On second thought , maybe you 're right . Because a good enemy actually puts up a fight . You were such easy pickings . You were naive , vulnerable , so desperate for a man , for any man that would pay more attention to you than the racetrack . And what did you think was gonna happen if we ever did get out of the dome ? That you and I , two people who couldn 't be any more different , were what ? Were gonna live happily ever after ? That was never going to happen . Just face it , Julia . You were nothing more than comfort food until I got out of here . You 're wrong . You mourned me in the Matrix . I lied . Go ahead , do your worst . The restraints , the pain , you ... none of that matters . Nothing that you do is gonna get me to leave Eva 's side . Do you think that baby is gonna have her beautiful eyes ? This isn 't the kinship , Julia . This is me . This is the real me . Whatever it was , that you thought was between us , it 's over . I ... don 't ... love you . What about her ? Your mate needs to be in the prime of her fertility ... healthy , strong ... maternal . She 's perfect . Charlotte Chastain . She was a junior when I was a senior . The younger ones I need . No , I want her . Fine , but you need to find me a suitable replacement . I need at least 12 girls . Have them waiting for me when I get back . Where are you going ? To say hello . Harriet . Hi . Oh , my goodness . Such a beautiful baby . Isn 't she ? Yeah . Where 's Big Jim and Julia ? They left a while ago . No , Hunter , it 's okay . Sam 's on our side . You finished with Christine 's recorder ? Almost . I seriously needed a break from her voice , so I moved on to the Aktaion files Lily sent . - Who 's Lily ? - Long story . Hektor Martin ? Longer story . Apparently , he 's the real head of Aktaion . I thought Barbie 's father was . Yeah , so did I. Turns out , this dude 's been secretly running it the whole time . Why would he hide his involvement ? Maybe because , from what I can tell , the government has their hand so far up him , he 's a Muppet . A rich , powerful and very bad Muppet . Come on , Sam . I want to show you something . Barbie ! Stop ! Julia ... ! Have you heard from Dale ? He 's been gone for hours . Eva , stop worrying . It 's not good for the baby . Who 's she ? This is Harriet , your midwife . Why would I need a midwife ? I only found out I was pregnant today . Eva , I told you , this isn 't any ordinary pregnancy . Your baby will be here before you know it . Now I need you to pack some things . We 're going somewhere your baby will receive the special care she deserves . I 'm not going anywhere until Dale 's back . But don 't you want what 's best for your baby ? Of course I do . I can promise you , this 'll only be for a short while . And when we return , Barbie will be here and you can be with him for as long as you wish . Go to the barn . I 'll let Eva shower and then bring her to you . I 'm sorry , Joe , I have no idea what this is . Christine never talked about building something that could bring down the dome ? This can bring down the dome ? I 'm not sure yet , but if these lines are sound waves , see how they 're all directed to this focal point where they 're expanding ? I would think that that focal point would have to be some sort of amplifier . Why would Christine need to amplify sound inside the dome ? I was wondering that too . Until I realized that every single attempt to destroy the dome has come from the outside . So what if the only way to bring it down comes from the inside ? Let me just find the page ... Sam , with the right frequency and amplitude , it 's possible that the dome could shatter , like an opera singer breaking a glass with her voice . Let me just find it here ... Does Christine know you have this ? I hope not . You know this is the part where I tell you it gets better with time . When Alice died , I was ... angry . But with Carolyn ... I 'm just sad . Then be sad . Just allow yourself to feel something . God , with everything that 's happened , I haven 't even asked how you 're doing . Sponge baths suck . I am sorry . If I hadn 't been on that roof when you came to find me , - I just ... - No , you never have to apologize to me , Norrie Calvert-Hill . Besides , being paralyzed isn 't my long-term plan . I 'm getting out of here . There 's a girl in Zenith I 'm gonna ask for a dance . Just a dance ? For your information , everything down there still works , thank you very much . I didn 't need to know that , okay ? Come on . Let 's see if Joe and Sam have figured out that schematic . Where 's Joe ? Yeah . Where 's Sam ? What happened ? Joe ! Joe , where are you ? ! How did you get inside Town Hall ? This is my town ! How the hell did you know I was coming ? I could smell you from a mile away . Guess I 'm not the only one who needed a shower , huh ? You made a mistake coming here alone , old man . I 'm fighting for two . That 's for calling me old . - Are you hurt ? - I 'm fine , I 'm fine . It was Big Jim . I stopped him . Whatever is happening to me , I am stronger . I 'm faster . It 's the baby . Come on , let Big Jim think he 's getting away . We can 't wait another minute to get you and your baby to safety . Julia ! Don 't . We 've been waiting . Go ahead . They 'll take care of you . " They " ? What are they all here for ? Your child . The future queen . I told you I wanted Charlotte . She came to me . Wanted to be a part of this . Don 't worry . I promise she won 't feel a thing . No one comes in or out . Red ! Indy ! I can 't find them anywhere . The schematic and the recorder are missing , too . Indy and Julia are missing . What happened there ? Sam 's a part of the kinship and I think he took Joe . Well , how the hell did he find us here ? We met him at the school and we thought he was still human . Grab everything you can . We need to get out of here . Now . Kyle . The rest are at Coggins ' Funeral Home . Gather everyone you can and go there . Where are you taking him ? Christine . I 'll go get the car . Okay . All right , I 'm gonna start loading . Son of a bitch ! They 're already here . We 're surrounded . Norrie . Then this is where we make our stand . You 're going to shoot me ? I will . Well , then , do it , Julia . Come on , pull that trigger . Go on . Go on . Right here , pull that trigger . Julia ... do it ! You should 've let me go . I love you . All I 've ever done is love you , since the moment we met . If there is anything left of the real Barbie in there ... I 'm taking him with me to the grave . Julia ? I 'm right here . Come back to me .

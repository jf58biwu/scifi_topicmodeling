 Agent MacLaren never did explain before they left how my ... teapot got smashed . I don 't suppose you ... Yeah . Doesn 't matter . I just dipped the bags in the cups . Careful , that 's hot . What is this ? Really ? Wow . It 's ... It 's tea . He said you wouldn 't remember the events of the last few months , but I ... didn 't expect that . It 's good . I like it . Yeah , I know you do . Blow on it , though , so you don 't ... burn your tongue . So this experimental procedure that they gave you ... what was that all about ? - Did it hurt ? - I ... I can 't tell you that . Because you don 't remember . I don 't , actually , but that 's not why I can 't tell you . Because it 's a secret . That part you remember . All right , you know , it doesn 't matter . It worked . And to be honest , Marcy , I 'm just ... I can 't tell you how relieved I am . Why can 't you tell me ? Well , I can . What did MacLaren tell you about me ? Everything . That you knew me on a professional level while I was undercover , but that we were friends now . I 've been staying here temporarily . And that 's it ? There wasn 't really that much time to brief me before you came home . Yeah . No . I just ... Yeah . He said the most important thing was that we were close . And that I can trust you . When I was in college , I learned all about amnesia in one of my courses . I don 't remember which course , ironically ... but I do remember learning that in a lot of cases , memories come back . That 's what I 'm hoping for . Charlotte , what 's wrong ? Did you have a bad dream ? It 's all right . Your mom 's here . Charlotte ? Charlotte ? Is everything all right in there ? No . You should come in . What are you doing here ? Hi . Thought we could ... work out together , and then ... go somewhere for breakfast . No , Grant . I mean , what are you doing here ? What do you mean ? I wanted to see you . What 's wrong with that ? I 'm not doing this here . Doing what ? Step off that thing for a second . Come on , let 's ... let 's talk . Now you want to talk ? What happened ? Did she break it off ? - What ? Who ? - Don 't insult me . What 's her name ? You want to do this here ? Fine . What 's her name , Grant ? You want to talk , let 's start the conversation with that . How did you know ? I didn 't , really , not for sure , but I guess I do now . Kat , I ... If you want to know when , it was the last time we had sex , after your surprise party . At the time , all I could think of was , " Wow , where the hell did he learn how to do that ? " Then afterwards , I realized there was obviously only one explanation . It was like you were making love to a different person . You were a different person . - How do you think that made me feel ? - In a way , I was . All I can tell you is that I 'm here now . And I wanna stay . I 'm not sure I want you to . David ? Yes ? - Hey . - What are these from ? What am I looking at ? These scars on my chest and my neck . These wounds are fresh , and it looks like it was done by a scalpel . Right . Yeah . You ... You performed minor surgery on yourself , installed something called a vagus nerve stimulator , supposed to help with the seizures you were having . By myself ? Why would I do that ? Yeah . That 's what I said . VNS therapy would have never worked in the case of pre-existing damage . Yeah , that 's what you said . Right after . I was apoplectic . There was blood everywhere . Obviously , I took it out . The only thing that seemed to help , or at least bought you time , was the ... lumbar punctures . You made some sort of serum out of the fluid . I couldn 't have done that by myself . You didn 't . I helped . Do you mind if I have some coffee before we continue this conversation ? Do you have any medical training ? Nope . You taught me . Do you remember coffee ? Do you ... Do you want some coffee ? If those treatments really did buy me time , then ... I owe you my life . No . You don 't owe me anything . You could do me a favor , though . You could ... You could ... You could do up one or ... two of those buttons on that shirt that I laid out for today , which , that ... I mean , that 's fine . Is it bothering you ? Bother 's the wrong word . Better ? I don 't know . David ... were we intimate ? See , the thing about that is ... you 'd only have my word to go by , which forces my inner boy scout to not take advantage . If that was a test , that wasn 't fair , 'cause I wasn 't ready . That was to thank you for helping me . I thought maybe you remembered something . There ... there is one thing . What ? What is it ? That you 're a reporter . A social worker . - But that 's okay . - We 'll work on it . I 'm here . Hey , it 's me . - I need your help . - What is it ? It 's Jeff . He 's ... I 've left you messages about this . He 's got me backed into a corner . He wants custody of my son . - Your son ? - Yes . What do you want me to do about it ? Talk to him . With ... with your position at the FBI , you can ... You can help ... I spoke to Jeff , Carly . Or rather , he spoke to me . - At work . - He did ? God , I want to bury that man . You need to get this situation under control . That 's why I need your help . Does Trevor call me every time he 's got trouble with his parents ? No , but you don 't sleep with Trevor , do you ? Fight your own battles , Carly , just like the rest of us . And then Rene said that all my pictures should have hashtag , boob job won 't fix this on them . So ... you didn 't retaliate ? What ? This is your problem exactly . You let people walk all over you . You need to establish dominance . Next time Rene says something to you , disparage her home life . Her mother 's had a DUI . Alternatively , you can just accept the fact that you 're less attractive and uninteresting . That option may even be more realistic . I 'm gonna go ... Good talk . Um , Ms. Day , can I talk to you for a minute ? Let 's not pretend I have a choice . What is it ? Um , I have some forms for a field trip I need your signature on . Shouldn 't your parents fill those out ? They 're dead . What ? Jesus . Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hey ! Hey ! What are you doing ? - She tried to kill me ! - I can tell ! Let me go ! I 'm on a mission ! - Go after her ! - And do what ? She 's a kid ! - A kid who tried to stab me to death ! - Why ? What 'd you do ? What did I do ? There 's something more going on here . - What ? - I can 't stay here . She 'll be back . - I have to get to Ellis . - No , no ! You 're not going anywhere just yet . Guys , it 's Trevor . We have to meet up at ops . A traveler just tried to kill Grace . Sorry . I had a hard time finding the place . I should have picked you up . It 's fine . I 'm here now . Not a single SOS that I can see . Maybe she was just targeting you . Of course she was targeting me . Are you sure it wasn 't just a student with a bone to pick ? No , I was there . You remember the family who had their historian misfire ? I 'm pretty sure it was the daughter . The girl I took to her grandma 's house ? Don 't look at me . Charlotte . She said she was on a mission . She was taken as a host anyway . Why would the director want you dead ? The director didn 't send her . I 've already told you , there 's a faction in the future ... No one but the director has the capability to send travelers . Tell them what you did . Tell them ! Or I will . I reset the director . What ? Rebooted its OS through a virus in order to protect it from corruption by the faction . What would they say in the 21st ? " Control , alt , delete . " That 's impossible . Well , the director is a highly advanced quantum AI program and I 'm the lead programmer , so , no , not impossible . You reset an AI that 's been running every facet of our lives since long before I was born , and not to mention every mission ... Before you were born , maybe . But not me . I helped create it . - No one else could 've done it . - How ? She uploaded a command while pretending to save Marcy 's life . How ? When she saw my code , it was sent back as visual information through the quantum bridge created during transfer of consciousness . You mean you used me ? I saved you , and I 'm saving the director . Where is the gratitude ? What is wrong with you people ? What 's happening in the future while it 's offline ? Chaos , probably . A temporary power struggle . The faction doesn 't believe in the grand plan . Even before Helios had basically no effect on the future , they had already started a mission to abandon ship . Your team knows firsthand the brutality they 're capable of . You mean they 're the ones who put us in those cages ? Tortured us ? To test your loyalty ... and to make sure you couldn 't complete a mission they disagreed with . That was the first real proof I had that they 'd managed to implement some of their agenda . So I came back here into the 21st to stop them . What do we do now ? The director will come back online more secure than ever , and soon , everything will go back to normal . " Thank you for saving us , Grace . " Please take me to Ellis ... before one of you gets overwritten and tries to kill me . What makes you think you 'll be safe there ? He 's taken precautions . Boss ? Yeah , get her outta here . But don 't let her out of your sight . " Thank you for saving us , Grace ! " Is this yours ? Yeah . I inherited it from my host . Historical record was wrong . You know , we should spend some more time debriefing you . - There are a lot of ... - What ? You just kept taking it ? You were helping me wean off it , but I had a little bit of a setback . Well , we 're starting again . No more than eight units . If you take more than that , it 's because you want it . And I won 't stand for that . And from now on ... I 'm keeping track of how much you dose . You 're the doctor . And you 're the historian . We need your mind clear . Ellis ! Ellis ! Ellis ! Ellis ! - Where is he ? - Not here . So you are gonna be hanging with the babysitter today . Just gonna hang tight , little man , and I 'll come back and get you after work , okay ? You wanna fly ? You wanna fly ? Hey , it 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay , it 's okay . Hey , guys . You okay ? Are you ... - okay ? - I 'm fine . I had no choice . She was gonna shoot you . - Yeah , she was . - You saw that , right ? Carly , what the fuck are you doin ' ? Carly ! You need to stay put ! Carly ! Carly ! Where the hell were you ? It 's dangerous out there ! I had to run out for a few supplies . What do you want now ? The faction sent an assassin after me . Not a very good one , apparently . Fortunately , I was there to stop her . - Where ? - At the school . Any of ' em follow you ? We 're alone . You can stop worrying about yourself . Were you a part of the reset , too ? - Reset ? - Of the director ? - That is too far . - It was the only way . Not by a long shot ! My God , the ego of this woman . When ? When I sat Marcy down at your computer . Right in front of me . - Give me a hand with this . - What is all this ? Are these SQUID transistors ? You think you 're the only one who figured out what the faction is up to ? Look , have a little faith . The director had its own contingency , although you 've probably screwed that all up . Wait , what contingency ? Me ... and this . I was sent back to assemble this . The director 's had teams working on core elements for months . First components arrived the day I came back to the 21st . - This is a quantum frame . - Yes , it is . If things get bad enough that the director has no choice but to escape the faction , it can send itself here to the 21st . Agent MacLaren . Officer Boyd . How can I help ... Jesus , what are you doing ? - What 'd you do ? - What ? What did you do that would make the director give an order to kill you ? How did you receive the order ? By messenger . Don 't change the subject . What did you do ? I think you already know I didn 't do anything wrong , or we wouldn 't be having this conversation . Your orders didn 't come from the director . - What does that mean ? - What was the message exactly ? " Kill 3468 , " so not a lot of room for interpretation . Another traveler I know had an attempt made on her life earlier today . By who , if not the director ? According to her , another faction from the future . I don 't know about any faction . Well , neither do I ... but apparently , things have changed since we left , and not for the better . That 's not good enough . It 's all I got . I only know what she told me . That 's a problem . It doesn 't have to be . - Does it ? - Yeah . It does . Take a step back . Take a step back , MacLaren ! - Hello ? - Hey , Marce . David ? I 'm glad you recognize my voice . So here 's something awkward ... There 's a man in my apartment who 's looking for you , and he has a gun . Has he hurt you ? Little bit . A little bit , but he said he 'd do a lot more if I didn 't phone you right away . He did point the gun nozzle ... You know , I know it 's not " nozzle , " but I can 't think of the word right now . I wanna say barrel ? You know , it 's not coming to me , but he 's got it pointed at the back of my head right now , so if you can imagine that ... that 's what 's happening , and that 's why I 'm calling you . Against my will . Kat . Grant ? What are you doing here ? Sorry to just show up like this , but it 's important . - How did you find me ? - I 'm FBI . And I need you to go home right now , pack a bag , go to your mother 's for a few days , maybe a week . What ? What 's going on ? - I 'm dealing with a situation at work . - Work ? - It 's not safe . - Tell me what 's happening . - I can 't . - Are you safe ? Look , I know it 's not the ideal time for me to make demands of you , but I need you to do as I ask . If something happened to you because of me ... I don 't know what I 'd do . - You 're serious . - Yes . All right , don 't worry about me . I 'll go right now . Just tell me that you 're gonna be all right . I 'll walk you to your car . Come on . Carly , where the hell are you ? I am in some serious shit . I need you to meet me down at the station and help me . You were the only witness that saw that I killed that girl to save you ! You just can 't run off to leave me to deal with this ! Call me back . - Yes ? - Excuse me . - I 'm here about your east wall . - What ? The building manager notified you , yes ? I just need your cooperation for a couple minutes , okay ? - Building manager ? - Yeah . He should have contacted you . I just need you to step aside for a moment , and I will be out of your way soon , okay ? Hello ? Answer it . - Hey , Marce ? - Duck . - What ? - Duck down now . God . God . Marce ? Marcy ? You shot him . What did you expect me to do ? He was gonna kill you right after me . I need you to go somewhere else for a couple nights , until it 's safe . Okay ? Go somewhere ? Marcy , there 's a dead guy on my living room floor ! I gotta call the police . If you insist on bringing them into this ... I need you to tell them that you don 't know where the shot came from . - You want me to lie ? - No , David . I want you to go somewhere safe , but if you 're gonna bring the police into this then , yes , lie . We 'll have to cover this up later . I need to go . Marcy ? Hello . You 've reached the confidential voicemail of Special Agent Forbes . Please leave a detailed message , and I 'll get back to you . Hey , Walt , it 's Kat again . I 'm sorry to keep calling , but I really need to talk to you . What 's going on ? I 'm worried . Please call me back . It 'll be a tight fit , all right . Do you even have a plan for when this is all ready ? I figured I 'd flip the switch and see what happens . - You would . - No , this one here . Plan for what ? For when the director is ready to send itself here . As of right now , this entire farm is protected by a space-time attenuator field . Covers the whole farm in a 100-yard radius . Nothing will penetrate it . No electronics , no GPS , no telemetry of any kind in the 21st or the future . So we 're invisible to the faction right now . And to the director . It won 't be able to send a messenger or consciousness here , let alone itself . As soon as we know the director 's back online , we 'll be safe and we can turn off the defenses . Then it can either come back to the 21st or stay where it is . Either way ... I 'll have to feed the pigs and milk the cow in the morning . It doesn 't make any sense . Why would the director want other teams to take each other out ? Maybe Grace was right . Maybe it 's the faction . Or maybe we 're being punished for helping her . Sorry , boss , nothing . No other teams reporting that they 've encountered this . Everything looks normal on the deep web . Well , there 's nothing to report if you don 't survive . Trevor , come in . Trevor ? He could be in danger . We have to warn him . Get down ! Go , go , go ! Why are you looking at me like that ? Nothing . No , I 'm not . Don 't tell me you had a thing for her . - Who ? - Who do you think ? Ew , don 't tell me that 's why you took her out into the woods . Grace Day was a lovely human being . She didn 't deserve to die , that 's all it was . I 'd prefer if you 'd refer to me in the present tense . You know , if you 're gonna go on pretending to be her , you 've got a lot of work to do . Look who 's talking . What 's that supposed to mean ? Your school record says your previous self was a recalcitrant bully whose only redeeming quality was a gift for something called ... football . Trevor Holden wouldn 't have given Grace the time of day ... She didn 't deserve to die . But Trevor Holden did ? Is that what you 're saying ? Existence should be based on merit ? You 're a hypocrite . How 's our progress ? I need to check in with my team . Just get to the farm . We 'll be right behind you . - No . - What is it ? I left Poppy behind . - Who 's Poppy ? - My turtle . You mean it belonged to your host ? No , I just bought it as a pet . You know , for company . A turtle . Yeah . That was a lot of gunfire . What if she got shot ? You think she 's gonna be okay ? I do . You 're a little different . It 's weird . Than what ? The Marcy I know . Knew . I don 't even know if that 's possible . I 'm not saying that you 're not you . Obviously , you 're you . How ... how am I different ? If I had to sum it up into one word , I would say that Marcy 1.0 ... was more fragile . Maybe because you knew you were gonna die . You don 't have the same burden . You don 't think it 's a burden coming into a team who already knows you , but you don 't know them ? I mean , other than the time that you trained together . - I 'm sure it is . - It 's me , Philip . Just give me some time to catch up . Mr. Mailer , I 've got someone coming to escort you to the station so we can talk further while the investigation ... I told you , the shot came outta nowhere . Well , not nowhere . It came from your neighbor 's apartment . We 're gonna take a statement from your neighbor . Maybe she saw someone . - I don 't have anything more to add that ... - You 've been under duress . We 're gonna give you some time to think . Seriously , I 'm fine . Sir , a man was shot in the head in your apartment , and you 're obviously holding back information , including the nature of your two cell phone calls prior to your calling 911 . Head on downstairs , please . Something wrong ? Stop the car . I need to do something . What ? We gotta stop doing this . - Doing what ? - All of it . Any of it . I can 't ... We 're fooling ourselves thinking that we could bring to the 21st what should have been left behind . I mean , Protocol 2 ... " Leave the future in the past . " But we both decided ... We can 't make exceptions because it 's convenient , or personal . I mean , this relationship ... we 've been holding on to all this time , it 's jeopardizing our team , our covers , our mission . And the mission comes first , right ? You know it does . Look , I just ... I think we 're better off ... I get it . - You 've got your life you gotta make work . - I said I get it . You don 't have to say any more . Drive . Stop ! Stop what you 're doing ! - Stop what ? - Look at this . Look at this . Mission abort ? The director must be back online . That message could 've come from your girlfriend for all we know . She doesn 't call me 0115 . Well , then it must be the faction . They 're on to what we 're doing . Or the director knows what you did and communicated to me the only way it could . You jumped into the 21st illegally . You took a host that wasn 't meant for you . You uploaded a virus ... - All for the greater good . - According to who ? You ? Listen , I told you that I had evidence that an attack on the director was imminent . I had no choice but to act . Well , all I can tell you is ... my mission didn 't come to me as a text . It came from the director , personally . - Before the reset . - What ? You received that mission from the director before I was able to send the reset . Obviously . I got here before you did . What difference does it make ? It was still vulnerable to corruption by the faction at that time . You two can argue all you want . I got my mission , and I 'm seeing it through . Then I 'm just gonna have to stop you . Trevor ... Trevor , just ... - Hey ! - Whoa , guys ! Good luck with that . They 're not in the house . Okay . Well , let 's have a look around . Trevor ! In the barn , guys ! What 's going on , Trev ? We were just having a conversation . At gunpoint ? You 're not going to shoot anyone , Ellis . Put the gun down . I 've got a mission to get done , and this young man objects . Were you given a mission to assassinate Trevor ? What ? Where the hell did that come from ? His mission was to build this . What is this ? Has to be a quantum frame . The director wanted a fail-safe in the event it had to come back to the 21st . And I just received a mission from the director to destroy it . - By messenger ? - Text . I went out of the range of the attenuation field to report in , and this message showed up . Bah ! That could be sent by anybody . It is pretty unorthodox . Or it was the only way the director could communicate . There 's no kids within miles . That message could have just as easily come from the faction . Or the faction gave you the order to build the quantum frame for their own purposes . Well , both can 't be true . Let 's figure it out , ' cause so far today , every member of my team has been targeted by assassins . More proof that the faction is behind this . That 's not how the director does things . Unless the director sent the assassins because we helped you . How can the faction possibly send messages to the 21st without the director knowing about it ? The director was offline for a short time after I sent the reset command . Or the faction has its own transfer system . There were rumors they were trying to build one of their own in Shelter 41 . Shelter 41 collapsed when I was a kid . This is something you remember ? We all remember . It was a structural flaw . The weight of the ice was too much . So we 're setting aside Protocol 2 now ? It collapsed at exactly 0600 as the reveille bell rang . Thousands of people died . It was horrible . Well , now , the people of Shelter 41 are very much alive and the founders of an underground movement against the director , which eventually became known as the faction . - This is news to you ? - To all of us . Well , apparently your work in the 21st has been a greater agent of change in the future than we thought . I 'm just tryin ' to get my head around this . Yeah , you too ? So you 're telling me the future you left wasn 't divided into two camps ? One loyal to the director and the other believing that decisions should be made by people , not a machine ? No , and that kind of division is what got us into trouble in the first place . The world we left was loyal to the director and the grand plan . Looks like all the grand plan has done so far is screw things up worse than before . - How do we know they 're not right ? - What ? Don 't be ridiculous . Humans make decisions based on greed and desire ... hate . - It 's been proven . - She 's right . The director saved us from the brink of extinction and created the grand plan , we have to trust that . - Is that what you believe ? - Of course . All of you ? I wish I could . But then again , the director didn 't send any of you back into the body of a young man addicted to heroin . Listen , we cannot second-guess what we came here to do . There is too much at stake . We have to have faith that the director is working toward the greater good . So we should follow the director , no matter what mission we 're given . - Is that right ? - What are you doing ? Carly ? Even if it 's the hardest thing you 've ever had to do ? " Kill 3468 . " That 's what it says . That is the mission I was given by the director . What do you think I should do ? Well , if you 're asking ... I prefer that you didn 't . But it 's not up to me . What the hell is that ? Someone 's on the property . Perimeter breach . - Assassins ? - The faction probably followed you here . Marcy , Philip , since you 're not occupied with gun pointing at the moment , would you go have a look outside , please ? Go over there . I don 't see anyone . I saw movement over by the house . We have to destroy the quantum frame before they get here . - Don 't do it , son . - Boss ? You know what you have to do . We don 't have a choice ! They 're gonna be here soon ! - Don 't . - There 's another way . It went right through her . - Marcy ! Help Trevor ! - Put the fucking gun down and help me ! Philip , what 's going on out there ? - Philip ! - You 'll be okay . Keep applying pressure . She 's a doctor . You 'll be okay . Turn off the defenses ... Drop the attenuation field . The director could still help us . Okay . Okay . They 're getting closer . The director 's coming ! Traveler 3468 . Mission abort . Destroy quantum frame immediately ! They 're surrounding the building . We need to get them out of here ! They 're coming in ! Freeze ! FBI ! Drop your weapons ! .Srt Extracted , Resynced by Dan4Jem , AD.MMXVI.XII

Did you lose anything in the reset ? I was pretty young . I mostly ... I mostly just remember the gadgets . Well , I was there . It proved one thing . Technology maintains stability . It 's the only thing that can . What VOPO does , Simon , is keep things constant . There are individuals who would like to undermine that stability . And that 's where you come in . It 's called , " quality control . " We 'll be organizing a candlelight vigil for the anniversary of the reset . There 's a sign up sheet for volunteers . And ... We could always use more candles .

Residents are advised to carry particle respirators at all times . Radiation in the outer zone areas remain at harmful levels . Outer zone citizens are urged to remain indoors and limit outdoor exposure to only one hour a day . Representatives from VOPO Technologies have announced that a fallen branch ... Try that . I see a lot of myself in you , Simon . What do you mean ? Facing the future and not knowing what it has in store for you . When I was your age , I knew a fellow named tom . Terrific guy . He could do anything with a computer . He could rig anything . Break into networks . Shut anything down with a click of a button . He was my best friend . We started VOPO together . Back then , it was actually an interactive media company . Everything we made was for personal distraction . But the company was struggling . Vopo was facing certain bankruptcy and complete failure . What did you do ? We went to a city in the desert . Far away from here . It was a terrible place for a city . I bet there 's nothing there now . But it was a place you could make a lot of money . If you were lucky . We took the last of VOPO 's venture capital and we placed a bet . We won more money than you can imagine . And saved the company . That was the best time of my life . What happened to tom ? It 's not much . Take care of yourself , sis . Thanks , Max . Nicely done , boys . No , no way . I 've never seen him like that before . You want a cocktail ? Sure . Who is that ? That 's Laura Gates . She used to work here . She used to have your job . We led them right to her . Are you all right ? My name is tom . You don 't know me , but I helped build the company that built your city . Hung the wires that power your homes . I built the system meant to protect you . I was wrong . We were all wrong . I 'm broadcasting this from a remote location outside the reach of your civilization . There is more in this world than what 's in City Six . There has to be . If you can find me , then we can find it together . Good luck , cowboys . Good luck , cowboys . That 's tom . The problem with tom was ... He was like Eric . Or your friend Max . We 're builders , Simon . Those guys only destroy . Simon , what do you think is out there ? I don 't know . That 's right , you don 't have any idea about the world around you . This continent is massive . What do you think 's out there ? Take a guess . Other people . Other cities . There are no other cities . If there were a better city , I would be there . What do you think would happen if someone from Sector Six made contact with whoever 's out there ? If your friend Max got through the firewall and told those people that we had electricity , grocery stores , running cars . They would come and take it away . They would take everything . And leave us dead in the dust . I know what happened with you and Eric . That 's why I hired you . We all have to make hard choices to survive . You of all people should know what . What are you doing , Max ? Everything all right in there , Simon ? Attention , this is a special City Six alert . Due to worsening conditions , the outside threat level has been elevated to imminent . All outer zone citizens will be required to relocate immediately . Temporary residences will be provided in the Southern block of City Six . Have a good night . You 're getting pretty good at that . And the target is in position . I 'm in . Confirm status . I do not have a visual . Repeat , I do not have a vis ... System compromised . Attention . System compromised . Target 's whereabouts are unknown . What do you see ? Talk to me ! Shit . No no no no , we 've lost visuals . All down , there ... Max ! I need you to drive . Drive ! What 's that sound ? It 's a countdown . For what ? Until the network comes back on . So how 'd you do it ? I don 't know what to tell you , man . Put this on . Is he doing all right ? Yeah , he 's fine . He just ... He forgot to put iodine in his water . What do you think you 're doing ? What do you mean ? Precautionary mandate 378 has been ordered . We are evacuating the outer zone of Sector Six . I 'm going to have to ask you turn around and get back in line . No . What did you say ? I said , " no . " Stay right here . What are you doing ? Just be cool . Hey , Max . What do you think is out there ? All right . I got visuals back up in northern block quad . I got visuals up in Eastern block quad . Visuals are being confirmed . We are back . We are back online , people . Thank God . What are you doing ? Just taking a piss . Are we safe ? Simon ! Simon ! You gotta come see this . Simon , we 're getting out of here . Simon ! You feeling better ? I feel amazing . I wanted that for you . I wanted you to get out . I was with Eric the first time he got arrested . I ratted him out . I know . He told me . It doesn 't matter , Simon . You 're one of us now . I 'm not . I wish I was , but I 'm not . I 'm not going back . Nobody 's asking you to . So what happens ? You go back ... You work for VOPO ... That 's it ? I did my best to help you , Max . Next time , I can 't make any promises . This is when you run , Max . Run ! Run !

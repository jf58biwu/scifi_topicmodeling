 - Yeah , her mistake . - She knows . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . Derek : Shut up , shut up ! James : I don 't wanna die here ! I don 't wanna die ! Derek : Just let me goddamn think ! - James : I 'm gonna die . - Derek : No way , bro , we 're not gonna let that happen . James : What do you mean , man ? What are you gonna do ? I 'm bleeding . Brandon : The bullet might have hit an artery . If it did , he wouldn 't be talking right now . What the hell do you know ? - You said you were a teacher . - I was . What 'd you even teach ? What 'd he teach ? - English lit . - Lausd made me take a course every year . Oh , Christ . I 'd do cpr , first responder basics . I know a little , not a lot . - I need to look at this , okay ? It 's gone through and through . That 's good . - How is that good ? - We don 't have to dig out the slug . So you take both hands . Top and bottom , squeeze together nice and tight . - We have to stop that bleeding . - I 'm gonna try to stitch it up . - With what ? With whatever I can find in his house . Derek : It 's gonna be okay . Hey , hey , hey . You okay , bro ? My man can take the pain . - What pain ? - Exactly . All right , we have to roll him over . What ? We 're not done ? You 've still got an exit wound , bro . Help me move him . Talk to me , man . What 's going on ? It hurts , huh , when we move you ? Okay , I need you to breathe . Okay , here 's what we 're gonna do . I 'm gonna stitch you up . When we 're done , I 'm not gonna move you . - Okay . - Not gonna move you anymore . - Okay ? - For how long ? Until he 's better . But he 'll get better ? Yeah , yeah , he 's gonna get better . Okay . I don 't even know your name . You 're so - yo , James . What you in the mood for , man ? Breast , wing ? Anything but a thigh , man . Travis : How you feeling ? Pretty good . Better . What 's your pain level ? Scale of one to 10 ? Like , a three . Three ? Maybe a four . Well , four is still pretty good considering . The protein will help , though ... With the healing , don 't you think ? Can 't hurt . Listen , i can 't help you if you won 't tell me what 's going on . So if things are getting any worse , you need to let me know . Try and get some rest . You gonna have any chicken , Mr. manawa ? No , we should be eating the eggs . Chris , come on . We need to talk . Sure . What do you want ? Wipe your face off first . Why ? Because you 're covered in grease . What difference does it make ? You killed a man today , Chris . Look at him . The least you could do is let is affect your appetite . I need to know what 's going on . What are you thinking , huh ? I mean , are you thinking anything ? He shot James . Dad , he shot my friend . What was I supposed to do ? - He 's not your friend . - He is . - They are . - They are savages . So I 'm a savage . Is that what you 're saying- - Chris , where the hell is your remorse ? This is how it works now . Look around . There is no more good , there is no more bad , right or wrong . It 's us or them , kill or be killed . And James , he 's one of us . You 've known these guys for two days . Did what I had to do . I 'm sorry , but I 'm not sorry . Oh , god . Remember the first few months of middle school ? Middle school ? I would hide every recess because the football guys used to make fun of me . Remember that ? What 'd you use to tell me ? I told you to play along . To try to fit in . Well ? The lesson was to play along , to act as if , not to become one of them . You don 't fit in with these guys . We all know that . But what you did , saving James today , that was huge . You proved your worth . Shoot , you could come out of this a hero . I don 't want to be a hero to these guys and neither should you . Look , just be careful how you play this , dad . We need them . No , we don 't . I do . - Open the gate . Open the gate . - Oscar : No . - Is she crazy ? - That 's Travis . That 's who I was talking to you about . He 's family . He 's family . - That 's my family . - Ah ! Where 's Chris ? I don 't know . Man : Al dentro ! You want to shower ? No . You hungry ? I could get you- - no , maddy . I don 't need anything . Where 's Nick ? He ran off like he always does . Any idea where ? I think he 's north . In Tijuana . Sorry . Where 's Chris ? I had no choice . Trav , where is he ? Wake up . Gotta go . What 's going on ? It 's moving day , is what 's going on . - Why ? - We 're all out of chickens . We should have been eating the eggs . I told you that . I 'm gonna be honest with you , teach , your schoolmarm shit 's is getting old . - So what about James ? - No , I 'm good to go . - You sure ? - Yeah . Absolutely . Okay , so a scale of one to 10 ? - It 's zero , man . - He 's better . - He 's not ready . - Dad . We only gave him a week . This isn 't the space shuttle . We 're taking a ride in a pickup . - Where ? - San Diego , like we planned . Usa , baby . Usa . San Diego is burned . We told you that . There 's nothing more there than here . - Yeah , that 's bullshit . - Chris , tell them what we saw . We never went to San Diego . - Oh , for Christ 's sake . - We never landed there . Never saw anything . - It is gone . - This isn 't a debate , Travis . We 're not debating this . We 're packing up the truck and we 're leaving . Now , you can come , but you 've got to stop with all this yap , yap , yap . - We got to go . - Right on . Now , let 's roll . Yeah , let 's go . Dad , we need a hand . Remember what the date is ? - What ? - The date . No . Dad , I lost track . What does it matter ? They 're waiting on us . Well , you tell them to sit and wait . - Grab a corner . - Four corners , four of us . We 'll lift him up , slide him right in . Let 's do this shit . Ah ! - You all right ? - Yeah , I 'm good . Chris and I will get in the back with him . Cool . I 'll control the tunes . Like hell , you will . It 's driver 's choice . Pad that down . See you , Mexico . " America " playing Travis : This is no good . Stop the truck . Don 't make them stop , please . Don 't make them stop the truck . Travis : Brandon ! Stop the truck . Brandon . Come on , Brandon . Stop the goddamn truck or your friend dies . Chris : Anything ? He 's still here . Just barely . Son of a bitch . Derek : We can 't keep doing this . Waiting . Brandon : No , and I don 't like it , but we 've got to learn from today . I don 't see him getting any better . We 're gonna need to come to terms with that . Chris : So what are we saying ? Yeah , what are we saying ? You wouldn 't understand . The hell 's wrong with you ? Huh ? You 're supposed to be his friends . - Stop it . - He 's not getting better . He would if you 'd give him a chance . Jesus , you gave him a week . He 's fighting and we need to help him . I mean , give him some time for his blood to clot up inside . That 's what they do in the hospitals . We 're not in a hospital . Well , this is as good as it gets . Look around . Think about it . We can survive here long enough for him to heal . We 've been here for a week . It 's safe . There 's no infected . - Come on , guys , you can save James . - He would understand . No , he is scared to death of you guys . I 'm starting to get why . I don 't know what to tell you , man . Dad , what are you doing ? Just stay away from him . Relax , bro . He 's not gonna do anything with it . - You 're not gonna kill him . - And you 're not gonna kill us . You don 't have the balls to . What the hell ? Why are you doing this ? I 'm doing this for you . James : What 's with the gun ? Your buddies , they want to put you down . They 're saying that you 'd understand . Why do you think I agreed to get in the truck ? I don 't understand , why kill you ? Why not just leave you here ? Back down in the sea or Cortez we had a friend with us . Yeah , your friend who got bitten , right ? Yeah , Troy . You know , he was- - he was sick and we were still figuring shit out . We didn 't know how it worked . We didn 't know what was gonna end up happening to him . We knew there was no way he was not gonna turn . Troy knew that , so he made us promise not to let that happen to him . And we didn 't . No matter where we go , it 's the same story just different people . No , when the time came , Troy got- - he got spooked . I mean , he lost a nerve , started begging us not to . Trying to get us to stop . Brandon was the one that was supposed to be doing it , but he couldn 't- - he couldn 't pull the trigger . So I grabbed the gun , i looked him in the eye , I said I was sorry . Figured that was the least I can do . Then he was gone . This is different . You 're not sick . - What do you call this ? - You 're not dying . You 're gonna get better . All you need is time . No , it doesn 't matter . What matters is they think I 'm dying . That 's the deal . I 'm dead weight . - Travis : Yeah ? - Chris : It 's me . - What do you want ? - To talk . And I thought you might be hungry , so I brought you some food . It 's not much , but did my best . Set it down . Arms up . Turn around . - I 'm not carrying . - Just do it . You don 't trust me ? I want to . You have no idea how much I want to . - Where are the others ? - Down the road . There was a waystead . They went to take care of it . They headed this way ? No . Maybe . I don 't know , dad . They were bored . Sit down . Look , i- - i just want to say , dad , that I get it . Oh , you get it ? What is it that you get ? What you 're trying to teach me . I mean , you don 't even like James . No , I don 't , son . But you 're still trying to save him anyways . And why is that ? Because his life still matters . And we 're not disposable . I mean , they 've known James since he was , like , six years old and they 're still gonna kill him . Imagine what they 'll do to me if anything happens , dad . No , I 'm gonna get us out of here . Okay ? Everything 's gonna be okay . Okay . I promise you . I promise you . - You guys ! You guys ! - Chris , what are you doing ? Chris , what the hell ? - Let me go . - I got him . Shut up ! No . No , man . Brandon . - Just don 't do this . - I 'm sorry , bro . - Leave him with me . - Look , I can get better . Just give me a little more time . I promise . - Brandon , don 't ! - Shut up ! - I 'm begging you , man . - Both of you . Travis : Chris , don 't let them do this . - Show me mercy Chris . Can we talk for a second ? Yeah , come here . - He 's not coming with . - He knows . - Elias . - Who 's that ? The farmer . His name was Elias Suarez . Born 1961 , February 12 . That 's your birthday . You said we shouldn 't be surprised by coincidences . This is forever , Chris . You drive away , i won 't be able to find you . You 're barely 16 years old . Don 't do this . Dad , what do you want me to do ? Stay with you ? - We were doing fine on our own . - Were we ? Yeah , we can . Now I can walk , we can . Dad , your way , it doesn 't work . It can 't . Chris , I promised your mother that I would take care of you . And you are . What ? By letting me go , you are . Dad , you won 't do what needs to be done . I 'm better off without you . Look , this whole time you had me thinking I was broken . But I wasn 't . I 'm not . I was just- - i was adapting . I 'm good now . I am begging you not to do this , Chris . Want to know the funny part ? With mom , you did it . What did I do ? You found it in you to do what needs to be done . And then you lost it . Chris , you have got it all backwards . There is a difference . Not anymore . - Let 's roll . - See ya , pops . Brandon : You all good , bro ? Take me home . It 's not too late . I 'm begging you , Chris . - I 'm sorry . - Chris . Come on . Get out of the truck . Chris . Chris ! God damn you , Chris ! What are the chances ? Of ? Two days , I 'm walking trying to find my way to the ocean . And when I do finally see the water ... I see the hotel lit up like a goddamn beacon and it 's you . We got lucky . Did we ? What are you saying ? If I hadn 't seen that light ... I never would have had to tell a soul what I did . Travis , you didn 't do anything wrong . I left him . Baby , come here . You need to listen to me , okay ? He was my son and I left him . We 're gonna get through this . We 're gonna get through it . I failed him , maddy . I failed him and I failed her . You said it yourself , Travis . You said it . He didn 't leave you any choice . I could have gone along with it . Let them kill James . Would have been the wrong thing to do , but I would have done right by my son . He 's still out there . He is . You got to believe that . That night at the vineyard- - oh , don 't . I was wrong . I was . He threatened Alicia . He threatened your daughter . I regret saying that . No , you were right . Before you and i were a family , Liza , Chris , and I , we were a family . So all that " they 're our children " shit I was spewing , - that was naive . - Travis . You and i were parents first . And your responsibility that night was to Alicia and you were doing what you were supposed to do . My responsibility was to Chris . And I promised her I would protect him . I know . The whole way walking here , you know what I thought ? I forgot to tell him i loved him . The second he was too far away , I realized the last thing i said to him was , " god damn you . " That 's the last thing his father said to him . That 's the last thing he 'll remember . You didn 't know him when he was little , but he had this huge heart . He was such a good boy . I know . When you met him he was already so angry . At me , Liza . We took away his family . He lost his place . He lost- - he had no place . I loved him . I never stopped . All he saw was my disgust at what he turned into , what I let him become . It is , it 's all he 'll ever know . - He knew . - No . No . It was true then , but now , I don 't ... - What ? Tell me . - We 're all living minute by minute here . Every single one of us . And at the drop of a hat , it could all be done . You won 't have a chance . I just wish I told him , that 's all . I have to find Alicia . - Andrés . - We had to let them in . 43 of them . We don 't have enough for nearly half . This is bad . I 've seen maybe a third of them . Once I 've examined everyone , we 'll work in shifts , come up with a plan . Decide who 's safe and who 's not . And then what to do with those who aren 't . Where 's Alicia ? Gracias . Is he okay ? He 'll be okay . Can you come with me ? Mom ? There 's something i didn 't say last night . Something I need you to understand . You don 't need to say anything . I understand . No , you don 't . Okay ? You can 't . So just hear me out , okay ? Okay . It 's about your father . His accident ... It wasn 't an accident . What ? I just- - I thought i was doing the right thing by not telling you . I didn 't know . I just- - i didn 't know what- - you told me he fell asleep . He didn 't . Mom . I 'm sorry . Are you sure ? I wouldn 't tell you if I wasn 't . He crashed his car . How can you possibly be certain if you don 't know- - there was a note . He left a note . They found it in his glove box . What did it say ? - It 's not important . - It 's not important ? Baby , he was a man of few words , okay ? And he could be quite precise if he wanted to . Tell me . " I love you all ... But enough 's enough . " And that 's it ? Yeah . What about Nick ? Does Nick know ? No . Nick is the reason why . Why what ? Why I kept it a secret . There 's so much of your father in Nick , you know ? The way he could light up a room with his smile . Or silence it with his mood . It 's impossible to ignore . You just couldn 't not see it . They shared the same demons . Hold my hand . I was always so afraid of Nick ending up like him that i- - it 's okay . No , you deserve better . You deserve more . So much more . But you have to know that I never- - I never ever loved you any less . Not ever . I just thought you were all right . I had to be . I 'm sorry . I know . I 'm so , so sorry . I love you , too . Thank you . Hola .

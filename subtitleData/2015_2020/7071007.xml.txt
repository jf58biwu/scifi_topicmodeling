 Previously on " Killjoys " ... All girls are filled with magic . I did it , Papa . She 's the me I should have been . She 's your good wolf . Jelco , I have a very special package with your name on it . I 've got something for you instead . No ! You 're not yourself these days . You 're right . I can 't be a leader right now . I don 't want to be . It 's your army . Take good care of it . Any captive can wrestle Big Borna for their freedom . Aneela 's abilities with the green are unlike anyone else 's . But thanks to a recent scientific breakthrough , we may not need her anymore . And that 's where you come in . Take her to treatment . So that 's obviously not the best case scenario . Yeah , that 's the only case scenario . I 've run every possible variable , and they all end like this . Explody ? Bullshit . Well , technically , this is an implosion . Well then , what are we missing ? We 've 34 Black Root ships we can pilot and sink now , 1,200 Ferran mercenaries , Qreshi money , and an assload of angry Killjoys out for revenge . And the Hullen have biology , Aneela , and a sweet-ass armada . Since when do you let biology make you her bitch ? Since 127 probable outcomes agree . Look , the Cleansed that Fancy recruited helped me build this model . Some of them have actually seen what we 're up against , D 'av . Head-to-head , we are toast . How am I supposed to present this to the war council tonight ? " Welcome , I 'll be your general this evening . Congratulations , you 've all signed up for certain death . " I guess you should have thought of that before giving yourself a promotion , jefe . - Don 't give me shit , Johnny . - Oh , I 'm giving you shit . See this ? This is my shit face . - You took Dutch 's army . - She abandoned her army . I gave her a push to wake her up . Since when doesn 't she push back ? That trip down Aneela memory lane jacked her up , and she won 't tell me why . She 's acting weird . She 's hiding something . I 'm worried about her , D 'av . So am I. But we 've got a war ringing our doorbell any minute , John . We need a leader , and whether we like it or not , it 's not gonna be Dutch . I don 't like it . But if I have to follow anyone else into shitty odds and a fiery death , I don 't hate that it 's you . Thank you . You say we can 't win this head-to-head . - We gotta get dirtier . - Ass-to-mouth ? I 'm saying if we 're gonna win this war , we gotta cheat , Killjoy style . - Whoa . - Freaky , huh ? I can 't believe you didn 't tell me . We had a sweet-ass piece of Hullen biotech just sitting here all lonesome ? Sabine led us to it . I wanted it destroyed . Which would have been senseless destruction of an innocent , beautiful device . Shh , now , it 's okay . You 're safe . Ow . What 's inside ? This one Khlyen made me was a safe house , but the first one he made was a prison for Aneela . I saw it in her memories . This baby only opens for Dutch , nobody else . So one keeps Aneela out ; the other locks her in . If we can figure out how it tells the difference between them , maybe we can use it . You learn anything about Aneela and the Remnant that might be useful ? Something so I know what to look for ? Just that she can go into the green and do things with memories that no one else can . D 'av 's ready for another round of war games . You in ? Later . I 'll catch up . You sure ? Mm-hmm . Okay , but I 'm eating all the good snacks . You don 't have to stay . This may take me a while . I know , but ... forget science and the cube . There 's something more important I need you to do . Please don 't say arm wrestle . They 're all useless shells . Maybe if we knew which of them helped Gander - take the Qreshi woman ... - Her name is Kendry . Why are you helping me , Brynn ? You aren 't slave Hullen . You have a choice . You 're free , like Gander . I fear you more than I fear him . Good . Tell me what you know . I 'm sorry , Commander , all I know is he used your research and he hid her away . He used my research ... on Kendry ? Where is Kendry ? It takes four minutes to drown . I 'd say you 've drowned and regenerated over 1,000 times by now . How 's my math ? Very good , Commander . Finally come for a chat ? No , Gander . I have come to break you . You got something ? Well , after our less-than-awesome war prognosis , I was studying the mirror cubes for Dutch , just pondering our Hullen ass-to-mouth conundrum . You ponder that a lot ? And I got to thinking , what if it 's not just swanky locks that make them safe ? So I ran a few diagnostics and found this . - Ooh , ahh , you 're a genius . - Shut up . Now , that awesomeness you didn 't hear was that silver cube emitting a frequency that can 't be detected by human senses . But if I fire the ship up , check out what these delicious little hertzes do to Hullen tech . Whoa . Complete disruption . Navs , comms , weapons systems : all fritzed . I think it 's got something to do with how the Hullen link up neurally with the ships . I think they 're communicating via a frequency on a wavelength that we can 't detect . But this little baby disrupts it . Johnny , this is good . This is good shit . If we can figure out a way to transmit this on a mass scale , we can fry them all mid-flight . It 's not a trap yet , but it 's a good start . Can you and Zeph nerd-gang some giant speaker unit for it ? A amplifier 's not a problem . The problem is locating a giant , sonic agitator . That is a specialty item . You need a giant vibrator . For science . And a little pleasure . But science first . Solution ? There 's a mining clan on Westerley . Now , they use a Bio-Frequency Sonic Disruptor to ... to strip-mine photonic crystals . It 's not perfect , but we can modify it to make it work . - So let 's go . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold on a second . There 's this one little problem . These are not the kind of people that you buy things from . Or trade with , or talk to , or make direct eye contact with . So we gotta steal it . Oh , we 're gonna steal it . And I know who can help us . We come baring gifts , Borna . Surprised to get your message . I heard Killjoys were going extinct in the Quad . And you two are next . No worries , the RAC 's under new management . - Jelco ? - Tut-tut-tut . Guns down , everyone . We 're all old friends here . If anything , I owe you two a thank you . For what ? Taking you hostage ? - Getting you fired ? - Exploding your house ? Ooh , I forgot about that one . - That 's a good one . - Yeah . When your associate Fancy cut me loose , I did get into a bit of trouble in the wilds , it 's true . But Borna here got me out of it . And we came to an exciting new arrangement . I made him my wife . Husband . The term is husband . - Turd . - " Third . " Husband number three . Not to brag . Talk . You want Intel on the Mole Miner Clan . - What are you offering ? - The Royale 's finest hokk . We got three more crates of it . Back of the line , turd . Is he Borna 's prisoner , or is Jelco into this ? With him , it 's hard to tell . The miners are violent , territorial , and paranoid . The photonic crystals they mine are worth a fortune in joy , but no one has ever managed to successfully rob them . Like I said , assholes . - Vulnerabilities ? - One . In transit . They take the crystals and all their gear in a convoy at the end of each dig . Specs on the convoy ... only thing I couldn 't get was codes for the safe truck they keep the crystals in . It 's all right . We don 't need them . So if you have all this Intel , why haven 't you robbed them yourselves ? 'Cause I ain 't stupid . It 'd take big brains and bigger balls to rob these bastards and live . Thank you . Compliment accepted . Gander . Gander . Gander . We 're getting tired now , aren 't we ? Your voice ... is dulcet as ever . I 've slashed your lungs twice , blinded you four ... Five . Five times . And I 've literally had your guts for garters , which , sadly , wasn 't as flattering as either of us might have hoped . Mm . I 've searched this ship high and low . Where is Kendry ? If you really wanted to know , you 'd let me connect to the green . Then you could go into my memories , and you could see for yourself . But you won 't , because you 're avoiding it . Oh , Commander , are we afraid ? You should be . Oh , I 'm freed , Gander ... But not of what you think . Okay , when we get back to the RAC , I 'll put together a team . 20 or so guys . Couple armored vehicles . No , can 't be a Killjoys-army mission . - Where have you been ? - With Zeph . Mani-pedis , pillow fights . Uh-huh . Trust me , this is literally the kind of job the phrase " you and what army ? " was made for . Johnny filled me in . It 's a good plan . Okay , but ... But your secret weapon only works if we keep it secret , D 'av . Look , I love our people , but the last time we tried a group op , we had a traitor . And we know how that ended . Okay , so , - what 's the alternative ? - Us . The way I see it , this is a straight-up reclamation gig . Don 't you think , Johnny ? Well , Westerley is old-school Killjoy turf . So you 're in ? Why not ? One last team mission . Just us assholes saving the day while we steal a shiny weapon . Could be fun . Remember fun ? That 's the thing that comes with all the scars , right ? Only if you do it right . Buckle up , buttercups . We 're going on a heist . Okay , yeah , something is definitely wrong with her . Seriously . So , they say the Mole Miner Clan are impossible to rob . Blah , blah , blah , get to the ass-kickery bit , please . They move the photonic crystals in a safe truck . That 's my sandwich , your shitty mugs are the guard vehicles , the safe is uncrackable , and outfitted with dead-man nukes . - You enter the wrong code once ... - And there she blows . Igniting all the crystals and sending everyone in a 50-mile radius to a horrific , fiery death . I vote for not that . Well , luckily we don 't actually want the crystals , so we are not gonna mess with the highly explody safe truck , right , boys and girls ? Hey , hey . You just ate a gunner . The grapes represent the Moles ' armed guards , and these bitches do not mess around . Now , the mine gear is in the rear . The Sonic Disruptor will be right there . Okay , so we know where the new dig site is . How do we know what route the convoy 's gonna take to get to it ? If it was my convoy , I 'd go straight through the plains . Fairly direct . There 's a workable ambush spot here . I call dibs . Yeah , if we can get the convoy to stop . That 's gonna be tricky . All the vehicles are controlled with retinal scan ignitions . And the Moles , they get a new batch of drivers every time they move sites . Well , it sounds like we need a woman on the inside . Let 's do this , shall we , Gander ? Well , I can 't say I 've enjoyed the foreplay so far , Commander . I know where Kendry is . And now , the Lady does too . So be it . Commander , what 's happening ? We 're changing course . Where are we going ? I think the Lady wants to have a word with you . You know what this is , don 't you , Brynn ? The core green , it runs the ship . Do you know where this goes ? Yes . Take me there . Lock the door . What is all this ? The library . Whenever we pass a new plasma pool , Gander sends out ships to bring back samples . And what do they use them for ? You . Our real job as handmaids is changing the plasma you bathe in and drink from , so Gander can study you for the Lady . What 's going on ? It 's her . All this is bonded to her . Tell them to stand down . I can 't override her . As long as she controls the plasma , she controls my ship , she controls my slaves . She controls me . Not anymore . What are you doing ? Taking back what 's mine . - Are we safe ? - For now . We need to get Kendry , before the Lady sends reinforcements . That 's him . He 's one of the Moles ' new drivers . You gotta get him alone upstairs so we can take him out quietly . Hey , handsome . Is this seat taken ? It 's a shame to drink alone . Hook a girl up ? Barkeep 's over there . Okay , then . Well , it 's , uh , hot out there today , huh ? I sure could use a long , cool drink . Buy you a drink upstairs ? Pass . Subtle . Oh , like you were any smoother . He 's into guns . Just not mine . Don 't have time for this . Hey , buddy , got a sec ? Sweet package . Is that a Troubetzkoy Blaster ? - Latest model . - Never seen one up close . - Looks like it 's got some heft . - Yeah . But it 's not the big guns you gotta look out for . It 's ... the little pricks you never see coming . You okay , guy ? Had a little too much to drink , huh ? I thought we were gonna do this somewhere private . We were , until it became clear someone had to get actual guns out . What did I tell you about incapacitating my customers ? Keep it in the back rooms ... - And not the ones that tip . - Thank you . Even if it determines the fate of our war ? 'Cause I think that deserves some front-room action . Front or back should always be a pre-game discussion , sweet cheeks . Fine . I 'll keep him here and out of your hair . Not done with him yet . One for me . And one for me . Three loads today . Pick your position . Kind of into missionary . You 're in the front , creeper . All right . I 'll go familiarize myself . Tough crowd . All right , Dutch is already in position . I just need you to hit the detonator and stop the convoy on the mark . You remember which wiry thing to plant the explosive on ? Sure . Base combustion . Cut the fuel line , wheels stop . Just make sure it 's the line and not the tank . The last thing that we need is this whole safe truck to go boom . Not my first rodeo , Johnny . The bomb is on a five-second delay . You got the detonator ? In my pocket . Hey , stop him ! Stop that thief ! Where is it ? He 's got a crystal . All right , listen up , primates . This is what happens when you screw with the Moles . Back to work . Get that piece of shit out of here . I 'm in position . Meet you at the rendezvous . Good to go . One last thing . What if I have to pee ? You guys are all about 10 : 00 and 2 : 00 , huh ? Safety first . It 's a little restrictive . You talk too much . Hey , Dutch , the truck in the back has the Sonic . The safe truck with the crystals is in the middle . Almost in the pipe . Are you ready ? For about two hours . Starting to get a bloody cramp . D 'av should be stopping the safe truck any minute now . Any minute . Okay , well , this is a little bit awkward , but , uh , between us boys , I left the army on a med ticket . I got this , uh , well , I guess you could call it a skin condition . Moist rash , if you will . I got a cream in my pocket , but ... damn these cuffed hands . That sounds like D 'av may not be in play . D 'av , you 're gonna ride right past Dutch in five , four , three , two ... Shit . They 've just gone straight past . What the hells is up with D 'av ? He can 't get to the detonator . What am I supposed to do , hitch a bloody ride ? Can you stop them remotely ? EMP ? No , I can 't risk it , not with the dead-man nukes on the safe truck . D 'av , you need to hit that trigger right now . Use your damn elbow if you have to . What the hells ? Sorry , fellas ! Sometimes you just gotta scratch . The fuel engine will pop any second . What was that ? What 's happening ? The safe truck 's lost power . Got company ! Stop ! You . Come here . Keep your eye on this one . I don 't trust him . Convoy 's halted . The Sonic truck has two guards . Time to move , Dutch . Yeah , with pleasure . Oh , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . We got company . Out here ? What are they , dust mites ? Worse . Jelco . Yeah , always popping up to ruin the mood . That 's him , the STD of villains . Good afternoon , gentlemen . This is a robbery . Is this some kind of joke ? I don 't think so . You think so ? Nope , no , this is quite definitely a robbery . You think three men can take on the Moles ? Oh , I can do a few better than that . And that driver is also a thief . Hey . Even if you get through us , you still need the right codes to get into the safe truck . Otherwise , the whole thing blows sky high . Look at this face . Does it look worried ? No . You know why not ? Because my friend there has got the codes already . No , I don 't . What do you mean , no , you don 't ? You told Borna you don 't need the codes . Oh , shitballs . Whoa , whoa , whoa , that safe truck is a pants-shittingly powerful nuclear weapon . What the hells is Jelco doing ? Crashing the party , stealing our crystals . Now , let 's not waste a sparkly distraction . I 'm grabbing the Sonic . Uncuff me , man . Don 't worry , sailor , you 'll be together soon . Oh , well , thanks for keeping the seat warm . I 've got the Sonic ! Time to sail , D 'av . D 'av ? Working on it ! Okay . Bringing Lucy round to the rendezvous in three minutes . Yeah . Get the Sonic out of here . Don 't wait for me . And there 's my backup . You were supposed to make this simple for us . Why would your lady friend ignore the big safe full of photonic crystals entirely ? She 's not into material things ? You 're going to have to explain a lot more than that . Or ... You could both just die a real painful death . So this is definitely a good news / bad news . - We got the Sonic ... - But they 've got D 'av . The Moles will be in retreat mode after the attack . We go in hot , they won 't be expecting it so fast . You think we got enough firepower for that ? Just you and me ? Well , they 've got two trucks , maybe 12 men who just blew half their ammo in the heist . - We 've got ... - Company . Oh , hey , Borna . Slabs of meat . What the hells is a Sonic ? And why do the Moles want it back from me ? Lucy , remember we talked about not opening the door for anyone with pamphlets ? Their pamphlets had nuke guns , Dutch . And we 'll use them , unless you tell me why my asshat third husband is in a Mole camp right now . Because he ambushed our heist to steal the Moles ' crystals . - Turd . - Right ? Also , do you know any other words ? If people find out you 've been double-crossing , it 'll be bad for business . Right now , my business is getting his scrawny ass back . Get that Sonic junk . You touch my junk , I touch yours . Borna , think it through . The minute you hand over this , they 'll kill Jelco , D 'av , and you . Jelco 's my strategy husband . I need him for this shit . Yeah , they 've got my right-hand guy too . Hey . I 'm right here . You 're my left , John . That 's the handsome one , right ? Closest to my heart . Let 's go get our boys back , shall we ? Is she ... dead ? She 's beautiful . Incubation overwrite . And she 's alive . They both are . Then why isn 't she moving ? She needs time . If I wake her too soon , it may traumatize ... Commander ! Oh . Hello . We 've come to put you back in your cage . Oh , I don 't think so . I don 't like cages . The Lady sends her regards . And I 'll be sure to send her your heads . Remember this moment , so you can pass on the message to your Lady . I found the door . And I know how to close it . Miss me ? Kendry . I was supposed to save you . Are you well ? I feel strong . And hungry . Oh , my ... Am I ... Don 't panic . What did they do to me ? Gander used my research . It was only a theory , but ... it worked . What is this ? I 'm not sure yet . But it may be the answer to our problems . Do you trust me ? I do . Then we 'll figure this out together . Do you want to go and torture Gander for a bit ? - Mm-hmm . - Okay . Let 's go torture Gander for a bit . Like , a lot of torture . Oh , as much as you want . And ice cream . I got word to Borna . Guess we 'll see if she likes you more than her last third husband . If I were you , I 'd be more worried about hurting any of her boys . She 's rather fond of them . And my boys aren 't too fond of dirt pirates who rip them off . So you better hope that Borna gets here soon with our machine before we run out of targets . He 's just talking tough . They wouldn 't dare lay a hand on Borna 's boys . No , don 't , please ! Oh , God . We 're all gonna die . Well , maybe you should 've thought about that before trying to rob these psychopaths . Oh , oh , really ? And what 's your excuse ? We 're on a mission to save the Quad , and humanity . Oh , spare me the speeches . Your real mission is protecting Dutch , whether she wants you to or not . I see the way you look at her . You 'd cut the balls from a dead man if she asked . Which I ... understand . The things we do for love , hey . I 'm not a third husband , Jelco . No , but you are a number two . You want to rethink that ? Well , take me and Borna . She 's got a lot of muscle around , especially Number One . Seen his abs ? Is there such a thing as an eight-pack ? Jelco , if you wanted help escaping Borna , you could have just told us . Escape ? Why would I want to escape ? I love Borna . - You do ? - Well , of course . She 's powerful and wily . Delicious curves . The way she treats you ? Well , if you think that 's bad , you 've never seen a Company year-end review . At least with Borna , after the berating and the punching , there 's cuddles . And then more punching , the sexy kind . No , I ... I like where I 'm headed , Jaqobis . Not on top . Certainly not on bottom . But right at her side . That 's the only spot that matters to me . That 's where I shine . Dutch is different . She doesn 't want to lead anymore . I don 't know how to get through to her . Some advice then ? Do you know the key to a good number two ? Fiber ? Give her something that no one else can , something she needs , whether she knows it or not . Like a truckload of crystals ? It was our anniversary . Oh , gosh , this is it . No , no , no , I know that auto-burst pattern . - That 's not the Moles . That 's Dutch . - Oh , we 're saved ? Well , we are sitting on a nuke truck . It ... it can never be just one thing , can it ? You fellas ready to come home ? Borna , darling . One husband as promised . I guess he 's into it . Try that shit again , I kill you myself . But I 'm glad you survived . You can ride up front with me . Oh , yes . Watch your back , Number One . I 'm coming for you . And your eight-pack . So ... we good ? My lady . They 're good . Poor little lamb . Had a bit of a day , have we ? I know the feeling . You 're looking well . New haircut ? I 'll almost miss you , Gander . Oh , am I going somewhere ? I 'll get my bag . I can tell you to enjoy these last few minutes , but honestly , I don 't want you to . You are nothing , you know ? Just another pretty doll , trying to reach outside her box , until I made you special . See , this is your fundamental problem . You keep underestimating me . This is about free will , which you took from me and no longer get to have . No . You put something in me , Gander . So now , I 'm putting something in you . - Take him to the chair . - No . No ! No ! Ground up all the other three Hullen . - Transfuse them all . - No . Except ... Brynn . She earned her reward . - Feeling better ? - I will . I 've got a list of degrading things I can 't wait to make him do . Who was he working for , Aneela ? If not you , then ... We call her the Lady . She lives in the green . Like the way you can go inside it ? Yes , but she 's stuck there . And she wants out . Out ? How ? I ran everything like you asked . I stripped your double helixes to their backbones . You and Aneela are virtually identical , except for one thing . You 're her chiral . Her what ? A double helix spins , right ? Your DNA spins in the opposite direction of Aneela 's , like a flipped image . The right strands of her DNA are the left of yours . That 's not supposed to be possible . So ... what the hells is going on , Dutch ? Remember when I told you that Aneela can do tricks in the green ? Yeah , she can go inside memories . And she can bring things back . She brought me out of the green , Zeph . Took me from a memory . What 's that make me ? Wait . Which pool of green plasma did she pull you from ? Hers . Hers ? She made it from her spinal fluid , her green . Whoa . Okay . Hang on , we need to think this through until we understand the rules , rework our plan of attack . - No , we don 't . - You aren 't getting it . In Hullen terms , Aneela may be your original source . - I know . - You need a demonstration . Zeph ? I know . I just needed to be sure . It 's okay . No , it 's not . This is not okay . We finally have our secret weapon . The armada will always have more ships . So , rangers , we need your people to scout and find an ideal site for war on the ground . How do we lure them into a ground fight ? We 'll need some kind of bait . Then we deploy the Sonic once their ships approach . And then ... Cut their numbers in half with one stroke . Half of them is still as assload more than all of us . If you want to be a pessimist . And if the Sonic disrupts their ships , won 't it disrupt our Black Root ships too ? Yeah , we 're working on that , okay ? This plan has an awful lot of moving parts . Are you fighting this war because it 's easy ? Or because it 's important ? This is a good plan , you guys . - Listen . - Enough ! I 'm tired of hearing how strong the Hullen are , that they 're unbeatable , because in battle , they 're one entity . What one knows , they all know . What one wants , they all want . - You 're not helping . - You are . The weapon that John is building right now changes that . It disrupts their connection . Separated , they are no different than us . Counterpoint : they still have instant healing and superior strength . The Hullen have no weakness . Oh , the Hullen have a weakness . Aneela . Numbers don 't count without free will . They 're not a million soldiers ; they 're one soldier . One voice : hers . So it doesn 't matter how many more legs a spider has . All you have to do is cut off its head . Kill Aneela , win the war . Have you decided what you want to do ? Not yet . In my defense , not exactly the type of decision I pictured making as a Hullen . How did you first become Hullen ? I had an arrangement with your father . Protect his interests during the Quad handover , he 'd transform me once it was done . But I failed . - Papa didn 't like failure . - Neither do I. But the conversion tools were still buried beneath Spring Hill , so I improvised . Hm . Why did you first bring me here , Aneela ? Papa trusted you . So I thought I might too . What 's the point of living forever if you have to do it all alone ? Gander has been dosing me with so much green all this time . I have so many memories swimming in my head . I 've tried to fix myself for so long . You 're the only thing that 's worked . You 're my tether , Kendry . She 's going to keep coming for us , isn 't she , the Lady ? Let her . I have hated Dutch for so long it blinded me . But I figured out a way to destroy her ... and the Lady too . Two bitches , one stone . I need you to do something for me first . You 're not gonna like it . That 's pretty . Aw , thanks . I meant your tune . Your pottery is still a hate crime . You know , ever since you got back from your Remnant acid trip , you have been in a very good mood . We just got a weapon that can take out half the Hullen and had some heisty goodness . What 's not to be happy about ? Yeah , that 's what I 'm trying to figure out . 'Cause this is weird . Something 's weird . You 're weird . Oh , because I 'm humming ? Yeah , I 'm a real monster . What happened in the Remnant , Dutch ? - What did you see ? - I told you . Just old family photos , baby shoes . - Aneela can do parlor tricks . - Bullshit . There 's more to it . Nothing relevant to the war , General . Yeah , that right there , that 's how I know something 's up . It 's not like you to step back from a fight . I am not . - I know what I have to do . - Kill Aneela ? We need something more concrete . You need a plan . - I have a plan . - Then tell me . I 'm the guy you don 't protect from ugly shit . Why start now ? Okay . Fine . Aneela made me . From her green . I 'm part of her . What does that mean , made you ? That ... that ... that doesn 't even make sense . All that matters is that it 's true . That 's how I 'm tied to her . Aneela 's my original source , D 'av . This is Hullen 101 , Dutch . If ... you kill Aneela ... I die too . That 's why you 're the general . I need you to think like one now . Johnny would put me first . And you know that can 't happen , right ? But with John 's new toy , we can distract the Hullen force . Minimal casualties . I sneak onto the armada . And then what ? I take down Aneela , like an assassin , like I was raised to . When I end Aneela , the war ends too . No one else has to die . Except you . You can 't save me without losing this war . And if we lose this war , she 's gonna kill me anyway . All that I ask is to get to take that bitch with me . That 's my plan . Okay .

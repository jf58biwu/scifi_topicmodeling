Did you know the equatorial diameter of the earth . Is 12,756 kilometers ? Paul ? No . We 're out . This is right now . Listen to me , david . I didn 't ... Yes . This was you . There was something you didn 't want us to see . Melanie , we were in the memory cube . Somehow , he teleported three of us 600 feet through two solid walls . What are you ? Where did you grow up ? Why ? You seem like a city girl . I was raised on the 31st floor . Mother ? Yeah , I had one of those . Father ? A couple . I think they were intimidated by her . She knew people . She traveled in circles . She was famously smart . She wrote these essays people talked about . We had these parties . " salons , " she called them . Artists with mustaches and men with money clips , Like big game hunters trying to bring her down . We kept their heads instead . We lived in the country . Read mostly picture books . That sounds nice . Trees and meadows . No crowds . Do you ever ... What ? Well , it 's ... Sometimes , I feel like I have long hair . Like , from when we ... When I was you . And it 's not like I just remember having it . I reach for it to , like , brush it out of my face , And it 's just ... it 's not there . Does that ... does that ever ... What else ? Sometimes , my balance is off . Like , my center of gravity and my hips ... Watch it . No . And ... What ? Well , you know , when we changed places , It was over , like , two hours , And , you know , I had to pee and ... No . No , it 's not ... I know how everything works down there , I just ... i ... No . Go on . No , i ... I didn 't touch anything or look . Any more than I had to . I just ... Look , just to be completely ... I did ... When we switched , I did ... Well , that 's okay . I ... What ? No , I didn 't . I should have , but I didn 't . It 's fine . It 's not my body , you know ? It 's just how I 've come to think about it , If anyone can just come and go . Isn 't that a little sad ? No . Not really . It 's like the soul , you know ? No one knows for sure . Does it exist ? But I 've got proof . We 're more than just this . I 've been a chinese man , a 300-pound woman , A five-year-old girl , but everywhere I go , I 'm me . Well , I liked it . Being you . I mean , not at first . That was really weird and horrifying , But then ... Looking in the mirror , seeing you ... Being able to hold your hand ... I don 't know . He has to take his pills , though . If he doesn 't , he gets in trouble , And they don 't ... the hospital ... They don 't know where he is . You don 't really believe he needs those pills , do you ? What do you mean ? He has schizophrenia . He doesn 't ? Sorry . I know you were a bit of a lab rat at division three . I just don 't like to be studied , you know ? Yeah . Yeah , could you hand me the thingy ? Me ? He means me . Great . More needles . I could knock you out , if it 'll help . Thanks . I think they want me awake . Yes . Awake is critical . This is nothing . It 's a dye to help me track things better . Sure . It 's nothing . It 's just a dye . May I ? Sure . Here we go . Little stick . All done . Could you maybe not break everything this time ? I 'm not gonna promise that . Okay . I 'll be right outside , okay ? Okay . Okay , david . We want to continue to model your brain waves . And take some hormone readings .

King ! " To bed , to bed , " the mother said . King ! Come on , boy . Come on ! " To bed , " she said . King . - The angry boy . Where are you ? His face turned red . Come on , king . His face turned red , And , with a cry , chopped her head . King . " No bed , " he said . And snicker-snack ... His mom was dead . Dead . Dead . Everything okay ? Yeah . I just ... I was just ... Psst , kid . Hey , kid . It 's sweet , really . They think they can save you . What is it ? The speech center of his brain is active , but he 's not talking . You can 't be here . What are you doing , kid ? Stop . You think you 're safe here ? With these clowns ? They 're helping me . Like the hospital helped you ? No . No . I 'm not sick . I have abilities . They 're showing me in my past . I have power . No . That 's good . I 'm happy for you . Meanwhile , who knows how many commandos . Are gangbanging your sister right in the corn hole , But you 're right ... that 's good . Work on you , man . That 's what matters . No . Melanie said ... " melanie said . " You think melanie 's on your side ? That bitch 's secrets have secrets . What do you mean ? Why are you doing this ? You 're supposed to be my friend . David , please . No . David , please . Stop it . No , stop it . They 're hurting me with their big , hard ... He 's heating up . Malfunction detected . Ambient pressure increasing incrementally . No ! Don 't ! Malfunction detected . Malfunction detected . Malfunction detected . Malfunction detected . Malfunction detected . Malfunction detected . Malfunction detected . Malfunction detected . Malfunction detected . He has schizophrenia . He doesn 't ? Amy , didn 't you once tell your husband it felt . Like you grew up in a haunted house ? How do you ... Strange noises in the night . Things moving on their own . You 'd leave your brother in the bathroom . And find him wandering outside , And when he told people about the voices , The visions , they said he was sick . They locked him up , so you said nothing . You let them put him in that place when you knew . No . You knew there was something else going on . Something magical . My brother had issues . Your brother has psychic powers . He 's a god . And you let them turn him into a fool . And now he 's running around free in the " on " position . With too much power and no self-control . And if you have any conscience at all ... You 'll help me find him . So I can turn him off . He hasn 't called . I promise , if I knew anything ... I 'm not a tough ... A tough person . You can ask anybody . So this , you , the leeches ... I mean , if I get a paper cut , I have to lay down . So if I knew , I would tell you . Syd ! Syd ! Syd ! God . God . God . David , don 't touch me . Okay , okay . I 'm okay . Okay .. Hey , if you learn to control that , You 're gonna be a world-class badass . Hey , come on . Let 's go . Are you sure he saw you ? He had , like , a creepy perm and one milky eye . What ? David , this is very important . You are not to go back there . I know , I know , I know , but maybe , maybe , If I can take syd there , maybe I can bring amy back . No . You surprised them . Next time , they 'll be waiting for you , And one of two things will happen . Either they will kill you , or they will let you go , Follow you here , and then they 'll kill all of us . Who are they ? I told you . They 're part of division three . No . That guy with the perm . You know him . This used to be a horse ranch . My husband inherited it in the ' 40s . Oliver . If you 've ridden the elevator or ordered a cup of coffee , You 've heard his voice . He died ? He built this place with cary 30 years ago . Before the divisions . Before anyone knew how fast the world would change . They built it , and they went looking for people . Like you to fill it . And they found walter , but he wasn 't like them . He wanted ... To hurt people . Great story , I just ... I don 't really care who he is . He has my sister , And we need to get her back . David , sit down . Please , sit . Honestly , I 've never seen a mind like yours before . It 's as if your brain is defending itself . Certain memories , certain parts of your story . Have been walled off or erased . What does that mean ? It means I can 't do what I need to do . To orient you , to train you . And frankly , I 'm concerned . That I 'm just making things worse . You 're giving up . No . You 're too important . Why ? Why am I so important ? Because we 're at war , and we 're losing , And you may be the most powerful mutant alive . You want to fix him so you can use him ? No . I want to fix him because he deserves to be healthy . And he deserves to be happy . And then I want to use him . All I care about is amy . Okay . Okay . My instinct , given the resistance , Is to slow down . No . I agree . I think your defenses are just getting stronger . I 'm afraid we 're gonna have to take a much harder approach . Meaning ? Meaning I want to sedate you . Not to the point of unconsciousness , But just to lower your defenses . Give us unfiltered access to your mind . I need that to figure out what 's real and what 's not real . I want to be there . No . No . Yes . When you go in , I 'm going too . We 're in this together . Do you want me to tell you why that 's a bad idea ? Not really . I worry that it 's not safe . Who rescued who from a pool . Surrounded by commandos with guns ? I just ... i 'll be fine . This is my ... it 's part of my figuring things out . My therapy . So I 'm gonna do this alone . What did you mean , " the vapor " ? What ? All good in the head now ? The pills . The prisoners . It 's always blue . Please choose . Soothing tones , White noise , Sounds of the forest ... I used to be a junkie , Before we met . Before clockworks . I was high basically all the time . Dimming the lights . I ... I lied to people , And I stole . We all did things . You know , my doctor used to say . That the word " monster " is not a noun , That to be a monster , You 've first got to ... Do something monstrous . If you come with me tomorrow , you are gonna see things . I can handle it . You will not feel the same about me . Do you love me ? You know I do . Then there 's nothing else to say . Everybody in here keeps saying that I 'm sane . What if they 're wrong ? Okay , david . Show us how you ended up in clockworks . You ready ? Just a pinprick . Into the left ! To the right ! Hobbly-wobblies . Hobbly-wobblies . Hobbly-wobblies . Blah , blah , blah . Hobbly-wobblies . I am not your camel ! Faster ! I thought david would be here . Isn 't that how it works ? He 's here . The sedation keeps his rational brain from being here . The child is the part of his mind that 's still awake . Hi . You can touch him if you want to . Your power doesn 't work here . Not without your physical body . Can we move this along ? Sorry . Big score potential . One last job , and I 'm out . What did the stars say ? Interesting . Memories within memories . Why say that ? Did you ... Guys , I think something 's coming . Ooh . Did you see that ? See what ? There was a flash , and I saw david . I don 't think that we should be here . Behind you ! What ? What did you see ? What ? We have to go . Okay , okay . Get us out of here . I can 't . David , come here . David , wait ! Wait ! Sydney ? Sydney ! David ? David . David ? David . David , come here . Come here . Come here . David . Hey . David , come here . We 're gonna play a little game , okay ? Hide-and-seek . Do you have a place that you like to hide ? A place where no one can find you ? In here ? David , come here ! Wait . David ? David , it 's okay . It 's just me . David , you need to wake up . I can 't help us anymore . It has to be you . Babe , if you 're in there , you need to wake up right now ! Ooh . Hey , hey . What happened ? Yeah . We 're gonna have a long conversation about that . Hey , check melanie . We got separated when you ran off . She 's still under . I hope she 's okay . David . David ? David , wake up . Aah ! Are you okay ? My hand ! Let me see . It 's okay . It 's not real . It 's just a memory . They can 't hurt you . I 'm not so sure those are memories . David ? David ? - Mad at you . I 'll always be mad at you . David .

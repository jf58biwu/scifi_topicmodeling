 Nick , grab the boat line . You 're gonna tie off . I can 't see the boat anymore . They 're out past the break . They 'll come back for us . What then ? Travis : No one 's that far ahead . Come on . Go take care of him . Strand . Boat 's unloaded . Strand . - That 's unfortunate . - Hey , we need to go back . No , you need to go back because we are about to have a number of uninvited guests . The Abigail can survive on the sea for a long time . Others will covet that . They will covet that . Point the launch towards land like I showed you . Go ! - Travis . - Oh , Jesus , maddy . Travis : Chris ! Chris , move to the water . - I can 't . - Chris ! I 'm not leaving her ! - Travis . - Chris- - Madison : Travis ! Maddy , watch out ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Go . Come on ! Come on ! Dad ! Come on ! Madison : Oh , no . Ugh . Well done , Nick . Careful . Once the winch is set , there 's a switch inside the trunk . Shouldn 't you be on the bridge ? The boat will tell me if there 's an obstacle . How far can it take us ? 3,000 miles , more if we don 't stress the engines . Daniel : That 'll give us options . Sure , we can make it all the way to El Salvador . We can survive on the Abigail for quite some time . Man : Mayday ! - Oh , god . - Mayday ! What are we gonna do ? Alicia : Mom ? - Go get Travis . Strand , stop the boat . That 's funny . There are people out there we can help . They 'll drown . Then they should return to land . We 're too far out . There 's nothing to go back to . Don 't do this . I filled my mercy quota . Seven people saved to date . Be thankful . Man : We need a doctor ! - We got company . - Travis : Oh , shit . - Where 's Madison ? - She 's talking to strand . We got to get these people . We 're gonna help them , right ? Right now help us . Inside there 's a radio . Listen to the channels . We got to get a track on where we can go that 's safe , okay ? What about these people ? I 'm gonna talk to strand . If you could do that for us ... Right now , go . We have to stay away from the coast , stay away from other people , stay away from the other boats . - What then ? - South . - We circle down to San Diego . - Travis , there 's a boat- - marines at Pendleton . Navy at coronado . Border patrol . If they held the line anywhere- the military are not gonna help us . - You prefer the alternative ? Stop the goddamn boat . That 's the alternative . If I stop the boat , it 'll be to drop folks off , not take them on . We can 't stop , maddy . It 's not safe . Mom , what happened ? Ask your new friend . Man on radio : Mayday , mayday , mayday . This is the summer wind . We 're taking on water- - woman on radio : There 's another boat . They 're boarding and I don 't know what they 're gonna do . Man # 2 : ... People on the cliff . People are jumping . Woman # 2 : They got hurt and won 't wake up . Woman # 3 : I saw his head go away . It just went away . Man on radio : This is coast guard station lalb . We have no assistance to provide . I repeat , there is no rescue by sea , land or by air . There 's nothing . Forgive us . Ahoy . I think you should have stopped . We had this conversation in the pens . Was I not clear ? This was different . I 'm sorry you feel that way . So , what if San Diego doesn 't work ? I don 't know . The whole world is I don 't know right now . You should be used to that . Let 's find you someplace to sleep . It 's not happening . You 've been up all night . So have you . So has everyone . No one 's slept . What are you doing ? Travis told me to do this . We don 't even know where we 're going . We 're heading south . San Diego . Or so it seems . Okay , and you know that 's safe how ? Right . Let- - just let me . Let me do this . Please ? Okay . I 'll sleep soon . I promise . He 's just sitting in there staring at her body . I don 't know what to do . There 's nothing to do . Maddy . Maddy , look at me . I know you wanted to help those people . How many did we leave behind ? You think that was easy for me ? But look at us . Look at where we are . We 're on this boat with no supplies , no concrete plan . We got an old man , a hurt woman , scared kids , and a corpse . You think bringing those people on board this ship is saving them ? I think about Matt . I think about our neighbors . - I think about them , too . - Yeah , I can 't do that anymore . - I can 't live with that . - So , what if those people were sick ? What if they were infected ? We don 't know . And we 're no good to anyone if we can 't take care of our own family . That 's who we have to hold on to , maddy . You , Alicia , Nick , Chris . I have to protect my son . That 's what it has to be . - I need you with me . - I am . - - Man on radio : Negative on that . - Negative on that . Woman : ... Seen anybody for days . Over . We have no food , we have no water . " Five years " playing on radio man # 2 : Hello ? Hello ? Is there anybody out there ? Anyone alive ? We 're alive , man . Barely . The end of the world 's got me super nostalgic . Give me a shout-out if you dig this tune . Is someone there ? Is someone there ? You 're not gonna get this song out of your head now . And you 're welcome . You 're shy . That 's cool . Doesn 't seem much point to that now , but , yeah , I get it . I understand . Come on , please talk to me . Please say something . Just say something . - I 'm here . I 'm sorry . Cool ? Your father taught you ? In a lake . Not like this . Big bear when I was a kid . So what do we catch out here ? Depends . Calico bass . Yellowtail . Rockfish . Whitefish . Sorry about your mother . Sorry about your wife . Yeah . Neither of us got to say good-bye . It would have not made a difference . Eel . Not pretty , but the meat is good . Whoa . Sorry . Uh ... Hey , do you want help with your bandage ? That doesn 't look so good . Liza said it would take some time to heal . I 'm actually pretty good with that stuff . I can manage . Okay . Hey , if you put ointment directly on the pad , then cover it , it hurts less . - Thanks . - And ice is good for the pain . And vodka . Lots of vodka . Man on radio : The boat got knocked around . When we left the Marina , everyone kind of lost their minds . Is it your brother 's boat ? Yeah , he 's got this shitty little boat , but he fishes out of Pedro , him and our cousin . Is it safe there where you are now ? I think so . We found a cove . It 's just , you know , we don 't have food and the fish aren 't biting . Where is it ? It 's , um- - I don 't know . I don 't know if I should say . I 'm sorry . No , it 's fine . I understand . So , where were you when it happened ? Um ... You okay ? It 's just not fair . Alicia ? It was over before i knew it started . It was all over . I 'm sorry . Have you lost anyone ? How 's Chris ? I saw you guys talking . We were fishing . You don 't talk when you fish . One day Chris will understand . What you did for his mother was an act of mercy . What I would not give to trade my failure for your mercy . - Strand : Hold- - hold on . - Strand ? Strand ? Strand ? That 's still my name . Someone 's playing music out there on the water . That is unlikely . No , I heard it . Sound carries strange on the water . Talking out loud to ghosts up here , keep myself awake . Yeah , I heard that , too . It 's a characteristic of the gifted . And the crazy . You know , you can sleep . We won 't throw you overboard . How deep is it here ? 44 meters . - Is that deep enough ? - Yes , more than . And we 're all clear ? Almost . We should take care of her . Where you gonna go ? I don 't know . We thought maybe like Hawaii . That 's far . And it 's Hawaii , right ? It 's like coconuts in paradise . - Paradise ? - No one 's gonna turn there . - In paradise ? But it 's too far , too far for this boat . Well , do you guys have water ? Yeah , we have some . We 've got little pans out hoping it rains , catch something . 'Cause if not , we 'll be drinking our own pee soon . Mm , tasty . Yeah , how about you ? You have water ? Uh , yeah , we have a desalinization system . Now , that is pretty swank , man . You must be rich . No , no , we- - we 're just passengers . We don 't have money . But you said you were on a yacht , right ? Yeah , it 's a big boat . So do you think you guys could make Hawaii ? Madison : Perfect day . I was thinking the same thing . What comes next ? What do you mean ? You knew what was going to happen in El sereno . How that ended . What now ? How does this end ? If this is the end of the world , it 's already over . Have you seen strand sleep since we boarded ? Ahab ? He doesn 't seem to need any sleep . You don 't trust him . He saved my son . He saved us . His house was real . This boat is real . He hasn 't lied . He was packing his bags before the bombs fell . He had no intention of staying on land in his big house with the tall gates . - Why ? - Thinks San Diego 's safer . Maybe it is , maybe it isn 't . Maybe he has motives he 's not sharing with us . So we watch him . I have been . Man on radio : It 's just my brother and me now and his wife . Just the three of us . Everyone 's gone . Everyone else is dead , turned , taken . I even saw it happen to my girlfriend . I 'm sorry . Um ... You all knew Liza long enough to see what kind of person she was , how devoted she was to her family . She loved to help people . She would help anyone and she did . She was selfless , you know ? She just would give from her heart . And she could be fierce . Oh , my god . She was so strong and ... It was painful sometimes . And the best thing that we ever did together was our son ... Who she loved more than anything or anyone . Come on , we 've got to talk . No , she 's gone . She 's buried now . No more strangers staring at her . - They 're not strangers any- - - strangers to me . - Not to your mother . - You don 't get to say that . You don 't get to say that like you knew her . Get off me , dad ! I could have said something different . - I could have fixed it . - How ? What are you gonna say ? What are you gonna do ? - I could have fixed it . - Chris , I 'm sorry . I don 't care . You shot her ! Travis . It went that well , huh ? Oh , yeah , great . Jack ? Jack ? - Jack : Hold on . Shit . - Jack , what 's wrong ? The hull got dinged up when we were leaving the Marina . We thought we patched it up , but we 're taking on water . - Are you gonna sink ? - The bilge pump is working , which is a miracle itself . We 're gonna try and make land . No , you can 't . The dead are there . You die on water , you die on land . - Gotta happen somewhere . - It doesn 't have to be now . We can come . We can come and get you . Tell me where you are . I can see the fire in the Santa Monica mountains . That smoke plume , is that to your north or your south ? - North . - Okay , we 're just south of that . Maybe two miles offshore . How close are you to Catalina ? Travis . Travis , someone needs help . - They 're sinking . - Who ? Look , it 's just him , his brother , and his sister-in-law . Just three . We can manage that . - What 's this ? - Jack . His name 's Jack . Who the hell is Jack ? You gonna make me ask twice ? He 's on a fishing boat near here and he 's sinking . You talked to him ? Yes , I talked to him . Did you tell him anything about us ? I- - no , I didn 't tell him anything important . What didn 't you say , Alicia ? What didn 't you tell him about us ? - Calm down . - This isn 't a game . It 's mob rule on land . You think it 's any better out here ? - Back off . - What are you gonna do , Travis ? You feel strong ? Please , let me explain the rules of the boat . Rule number one , it 's my boat . Rule number two , it is my boat . And if there remains any confusion about rules one and two , I offer rule number three , it 's my goddamn boat . If it weren 't for me , you would all be burned . You 're welcome . I 'm tired . Alicia 's just trying to help . She 's trying to help those who don 't matter to us . She made a mistake we can 't afford . Everyone here needs to contribute or at the very least not compromise . And how do I contribute ? Why am I here ? You mean on this boat or here existentially ? Either . How many times should you have died ? I don 't know . Every time I used . Were you afraid ? That 's fearlessness . That 's focus . That 's just being an addict . It 's not something you put on your resume . But what does that fearlessness look like in this world ? That has value , Nicholas . Don 't call me that . Your father named you that . Yeah , that 's what he called me . Hurt your hand ? It 's okay to be angry . I remember the first time i hit my father . I was furious . I was 13 . It didn 't end well . What do you want ? I want you to come up . Chris , you need to eat . There 's nothing I can say that makes this better . Hurts like hell , i know that . And it doesn 't go away . The hurt stays . But what happened had to . And if your father hadn 't done it , I would have . I will never let that happen to someone I love . - If not ... - Yeah , here . - ... they got fish . - What was that ? - Daniel : There was a splash . Chris ! Chris . Nick . What the hell , man ? What the hell are you doing ? I wanted to swim . Oh , okay . Swim . - Is he okay ? - Chris . Hey , come on in . Water 's fine . Jack : Alicia . - Are you there ? - Jack . We can 't come get you . I 'm sorry . It 's too dangerous . - Jack ? - It 's okay , Alicia . - I got you . - Jack ? I 'll see you soon . Mom ! Travis . Madison : Oh , my god . Get out of the water ! - Chris , get out of there ! - Get out ! - Oh , my god . - Alicia : Where is he ? - Alicia : Nick ! - I hear someone . Nick ! - Where is he ? - Travis : It 's flooded . - Go ! Madison : Chris ! Madison : Nick ! Madison : Nick ! Travis : Nick , where are you ? - Oh , my god . - Where is he ? - - Nick ! Oh , my god . Nick ! Chris : Dad ? Travis : Nick ! Nick ! Alicia : He 's right there . Holy shit . We should be leaving now . Someone 's joining us . - Travis ! - It could be no one . It could be the ones who did that . Travis has Nick . They 're coming back . Good , but this boat 's gonna be on us . They 're doing a good 25 knots . They 're flying . - How fast can we go ? - Full out , 20 . But that 'll work the engines too hard . We need a head start . Madison : You think that 's the boat that killed those people ? You want to wait and ask them ? High . We have to go . We have to go now . - What ? - Strand , we 're clear . Hey , what 's happening ? What 's going on ? Whoever did that ... They 're coming back .

 Previously on The Shannara Chronicles ... ALLANON : The Changeling is an ancient Demon that can inhabit the form of any being it chooses . Ugh ! Long live the King . KING : The Druid has been lying to us . This sword is a talisman of evil ! It is you who are the danger . - ( YELLS ) - KING : The Druid is no more . CEPHELO : Pykon 's no fairytale . My parents died in the dungeons of that stinking Elvin fortress . I 'd really like to get the hell out of here . - Run ! - ( ROARING ) - WIL : Keep going ! - AMBERLE : Run ! Die already ! - To hell with that ! - ( ALL SCREAM ) ( TENSE MUSIC ) ( GASPS ) The Stones ... ( GASPS ) Amberle ? Eretria ? Eretria ? ( CROWS CAW ) ( FLUTTERING ) Hello ? - Arggh ! - Hey ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! What are you doing ? Who are you ? ( GRUNTS ) Who are you ? Come on , man . You 're hurting yourself . ( GRUNTS ) Wait , wait ! Please ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Wait ! Please . - You 're one of them , aren 't you ? - Who ? One of who ? The Elf Hunters . They took my ear . Oh ... No . It 's OK . Look . I 'm half Elf . Attacking isn 't an option . The terrain is too hostile . The army 's too big . We 'd be crushed before we even reached the battlefield . ARION : What about the Federation ? Even if they agreed to fight by our side and sent every available soldier in the Four Lands , I still don 't like our chances . What if it were not an attack but an assassination ? We have the blade , and with the Druid out of the way , we have the advantage of surprise . A lot has happened in your absence , brother . The Druid was in league with the Dagda Mor . How is that possible ? Oh , that means Amberle 's ... We have to assume that she 's been misled . Tell me , if a force was small enough , could it reach the henge undetected ? Even if we got there , it 's surrounded by magic . Dark magic , the type that the Warlock blade was forged to combat . The Dagda Mor would be powerless against it . You need to sneak in and kill him . - You can 't be serious . - lt 's our only chance . At what ? Dying ? We can 't send our soldiers to slaughter like that . I should be the one to go . I will bring you back his head . Let me wield the blade for you . No . You 're next in line . You 're needed here . I 'll go . You are both my sons . There are no two men on the planet that I could be more certain of would bring home a victory . You shall both go . What ? - But , Father ... - The decision is made . Two sons , one blade one purpose . ( CHUCKLES ) The Demon won 't even know you 're coming . SONG : ♪ I feel it running through my veins ♪ And I need that fire ♪ Just to know that I 'm awake . ♪ ( PANTING AND GASPING ) ( COUGHS ) Wil ? ! Eretria ? ! Oh ! WOMAN : Where did he go ? MAN : He slipped out of my hands . WOMAN : I need his other ear . ( MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ) You lost him . WOMAN : Elves just don 't fall out of the sky every day . Find that Elf ! MAN : I 'll find him . Shh ! ( WHISPERS ) They 've done something to Wil . - We need to ... - Those aren 't just any humans . They 're Elf Hunters . ( GASPING AND WHEEZING ) ( GAGS AND MOANS ) ( SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( GROANS ) You look worried . It is not weakness to disobey your father 's orders . They are the King 's orders . I know . But rushing in alone to kill the Dagda Mor is suicide . So is waiting . This is a chance to prove myself worthy . I know that you 're upset with him , but you cannot make him give you the crown . Now is the time to stand united , together , behind the walls of Arborlon . I can 't . This will stop the bleeding . Wow. lt ... it feels good . Mmm . Real good . ( CHUCKLES ) This particular combo is also good for recreational use . Tell rne more about these Hunters . Uh , they 're human , hate Elves . They hunt us down and harvest our ears . Harvest them ? Harvest them for what ? Gnomes . They think Elf ears have some sort of medical properties . By this time next week , my left ear will be ground up in some horny Gnome 's tea . I was travelling with two friends . I 'm worried that these Hunters might have snatched them . Either of your friends an Elf ? Then you should be worried . AMBERLE : Eretria . - Eretria , we have to go back . - You 're not safe back there . And so we just leave Wil ? Of course not . We find cover and then we go back and look for him once night falls . ( BRANCH SNAPS IN DISTANCE ) Run ! ( ARROWS WHISTLE AND THUD ) Amberle ! Come on . We lost them . We need to get back to camp and round everyone up . Now . This isn 't just any Elf we 're hunting . This one is royal . That was close . Yeah , no kidding . Sometimes I feel like there 's someone watching over us . I don 't know if you 'd call it magic or fate ... - ( CLICK ) - ( BOTH GASP ) ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( COUGHS ) - Are you OK ? - ( GRUNTS ) Yeah , I think so . Oh ... AMBERLE : Where are we ? I don 't know . Wait . I 've heard of places like this . Buildings from the Age of Man , buried during the Great War . You can 't seriously believe that . It would have rotted away by now . No . They were sealed and preserved . Like a butterfly caught in amber . It 's almost like they were gonna have a party . ERETRIA : Place is creepy , if you ask me . ( BATS FLITTER AND SCREECH ) Whatever this place is , we need to get out of here , and fast , before those Elf Hunters find us . And that 's our way out . MAN : We 'll find out when she returns . ( HUNTERS CHATTER INDISTINCTLY ) When they cut off my ear , the pain ... When they went for the other one , my partner , Genewen , fought back , and I escaped . I think they have her in there . Maybe your friends too . What were you two doing out here ? We were on a scouting mission . We come from Olden Moor . Never heard of it . Some of the Elvin settlements were coming under attack by Demons , so we started scouting missions to warn the outlying villages . It 's him - the one who took my ear . WIL : Shh ! Wait here . - Gather ! - ( HUNTERS CALL OUT ) We spotted an Elf and a human travelling north below the ridge trail . - This Elf ... is a royal . - ( HUNTERS MURMUR AND EXCLAIM ) Her ears will keep us in furs and drink for many winters to come . The first who hands me her head will be paid double . ( HUNTERS CHATTER EXCITEDLY ) ( ERETRIA GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) AMBERLE : They had no idea their world was about to end . They look happy . They look dead to me . You can drop the whole tough girl act , you know . What 's that supposed to mean ? You were across that line at Pykon . You could have easily left us there , but you didn 't . You came back . You saved my life . Don 't over-think it , Princess . You die , I don 't get paid . - I don 't believe that . - I don 't care . Fine . I do care . Why don 't we braid each other 's hair , have a party , talk about the boys we like ? - Sound good to you ? - Hilarious . Now , why don 't you put that stupid book down and help me find a way out of this tomb ? Anything I can say to stop you from going on this suicide mission ? Could think of a few that might delay me a few hours . I 'm serious . I have a bad feeling . What choice do we have ? The Druid is gone . Amberle is out of reach . People are losing hope . But thanks to you , we know exactly where our enemy is . And for the first time since this war began , we have a weapon strong enough to defeat their magic . OK , you 're right . The people need you . Yes , they do . Got any last words of advice for me , Commander ? Don 't die . Oh , that 's an excellent plan . Arggh ! Huh ! ( GASPS ) Bremen ! Yes , my apprentice . I have walked these lands for over 300 years . I am tired , tired of people refusing to believe the truth . I am ready to leave , master . I am ready to join you on the other side . It is not your time . There 's work yet to be done . What more can I do ... alone ? You are not alone . Another has emerged , powerful , full of promise , and without you , they cannot fight what is coming . You must be strong . The world is at a tipping point . Without you , all will be lost . ( ALLANON GASPS ) Bremen ... ( INHALES SHARPLY ) BREMENI Go ! ( GASPS ) We need to find a door out of here . I think this is it . - ( GRUNTS ) - ( sighs ) We 're never gonna get out of here . Ohh ... You 're hurt . It 's just a scratch . You need to get warm . I need to take a look at that . So you do care . About you slowing us down ? Yes . Come on . Let 's go . WOMAN : Hunters , move out ! - HUNTERS : Go , go ! - WOMAN : Cormac . Guard the camp . I 'm going after my friends . I have to follow . As soon as I find them , we 'll come and help you get Genewen back . You have my word . Will you wait ? I 'll wait , but only because I owe you my life . That 's my ear . Hey , Perk ! You said you 'd wait ! That 's ... my ... ear ! Little one . You came back . You owe me another ear . Arggh ! ( GRUNTS ) Ugh ! Ow ! ( MOANS ) Arggh , arggh ! ( GROANS ) ( SCREAMS ) You sure you want to do that ? ( AMBERLE INHALES SHARPLY ) It happened when I hit the water . I floated downstream and ... it slammed into this jagged rock . I thought I was gonna drown . Do you think he made it ? Of course he did . Do you know how many times I 've tried to get rid of that guy ? Yeah , he 'll probably sail in here and save the day any minute . ERETRIA : Exactly . And he was in your vision . I 'm guessing your old tree has no reason to lie . What 'd you see in there anyway ? You never told me . I saw you and Wil standing in front of this incredible stained-glass window . It was right after I ... Right after what ? Right after I killed Wil . The tree said I had to do it to prove I was ready for what 's ahead . I 'm sorry you had to do that . Not as sorry as I am . The things we 've seen since this all started ... All the innocent blood that 's been spilled ... You know , and what 's the point ? Now that I know what my grandfather did in the name of our kind , maybe you were right about the Elves . Maybe we don 't deserve saving . Yeah , maybe none of us do . Perhaps it would be better for the Demons to do their bidding , wash the slate clean . Well , it didn 't work out too well the last time . I know how it feels to be trapped by your own life . I didn 't exactly choose to be a Rover . You said you were bought . So the story goes . According to Cephelo , he vastly underpaid . I guess my first owners were pretty eager to unload me . And who knows about my parents ? That 's awful . No , a child shouldn 't be left to walk through life alone . But on the bright side , we 've finally found something we have in common . We 're orphans . Well , it 's a reach , but I 'll take it . Who would 've thought - the princess and the Rover . Bound by a tragic fate and ... - Hot for the same guy ' ? - ( CHUCKLES ) One hell of a mess , aren 't we ? ( CRASH AND YELLING ) WOMAN : They 're here . Find them . Nobody gets out . Now , about my friends . Tell me where you last saw them . Why bother ? They 're probably dead already . Zora - she 's the best Elf Hunter this side of the Drey Wood . It 's all you . Wait , wait , wait ! OK , OK . OK . Head east , past the tree line . Follow the game trail . That 's where they disappeared . I swear . I swear . That 's all I know . Thanks . You did the right thing . - Go ahead . - What ? Didn 't think we were gonna just let you go ? Wait ! It 's OK , tough guy . ( CHUCKLES ) Torture 's not really my thing . ( LAUGHS ) Ugh ! ( GAGS ) Taking out a serial Elf killer , on the other hand , is a top priority . You didn 't have to do that ! Kill or be killed - that 's the only way . No , it 's not ! It makes you just as bad as he is . He got what he deserved , and I 'm not sorry . Give me a hand . Hey , girl . You OK ? ( GENTLE SCREECHING ) - That is Genewen ? - ( GENEWEN SCREECHES ) ZORA : Split up . We 'll cover more ground . We need to get those ropes . Please don 't hurt me . ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( GROANS ) Thanks . Arggh ... ! Let 's get out of here . ( HORSES GRUNT SOFTLY ) There 's a small ravine that runs to the west of the Breakline . Lets out just beyond the Dagda Mor 's henge . It 's our best chance of slipping past the Demon army and getting to him . Let 's hope that blade protects us . I 'm willing to bet they 're not expecting two idiot princes to fly in there solo . We 've got that to our advantage . ( CHUCKLES ) There 's no way we 're gonna make it out of there alive . Right ? That 's the burden of princes . ( WHISPERS ) Come on . What ? She 's still here ! We have to go . That 's the window from my vision . Ending up here was no accident . This is how we find the Bloodfire . - Are you sure ? - Positive . Long time no see , Eretria . ZORA : I always knew we 'd meet again . Happy to see you too , Zora . You two know each other ? ERETRIA : We grew up together . When was the last time we saw each other ? Oh , that 's right . When you left me . Well , that 's an exaggeration . We had a thing , but you got a little clingy . Do you know what it was like for me , alone , in the wilderness ? So you started collecting Elf ears for a living ? Sit . I 'm impressed with how you took out my Hunters . Not bad for a pampered princess and her ... What are you anyway ? Her pet ? You 're an embarrassment to the human race . Well , coming from you , I 'll take it as a compliment . I don 't know what 's going on between the two of you , but you need to let us go . - Is that right ' ? - Don 't bother . The Four Lands is in danger . You must have heard about the Demon attacks . I 'm not interested in your stories , Princess . Just your ears . ( WIND WHISTLES ) Something 's wrong . There should be thousands upon thousands of Demons . I saw them here with my own eyes . You 're sure this is the right place ? Yes . There . That 's the Dagda Mor 's henge . Totally unguarded . Perhaps the Demons have already been dispatched and are marching on Arborlon . Or Amberle . Now is the time to strike , is it not ? Are you with me , brother ? I 'm ready . Afraid there 's only room for two on this ride . Maybe in the next life . Shame you have to die . Ugh ! ( FOOTSTEPS ) ( SCREECHING ) ( YELLS ) Wil ! - You 're alive . - Oh ! - What is that ? - ( GENEWEN SCREECHES ) WIL : She 's called a Roc . I saved her and her partner , Perk . - He 's a Wing Rider . - ( MOANS ) WIL : Let 's go ! WIL : Hold on . ERETRIA : Uh ! Ugh ! AMBERLE : Eretria ! AMBERLE : We have to go back ! ( ARROWS WHISTLE ) ( GENEWEN SCREECHES ) Ah ! Bandon ! ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( SNARLS ) ( CLINK ) DAGDA MOR : I 've been expecting you . Keep your distance . We don 't know what he 's capable of . Foolish prince . I tell you to fetch my sword and you do it . I command you to kill the Druid and you run him through . They were the King 's commands . Your father is dead . Father . And you are my puppet . - Ander , no ! - ( DAGDA MOR LAUGHS ) Arggh ! ( DAGDA MOR GRUNTS ) Arggh ! I tricked you into delivering me this sword . Now you will test its blade . Ugh ! No ! Ugh ! ( WHEEZES ) No ! ( SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( ROARS ) Arggh ! Ohh ! ( BIRDS CHIRP ) ( INHALES SHARPLY ) - AMBERLE : It 's taking too long . - WIL : He 'll be back . You just got to be patient . What you got there ? Oh , just something I found inside . What are they ? It 's just some sort of game or ... I don 't know . It 's silly . No . Tell me . They reminded me of you . PERK : Hey ! WIL : Any sign ? They packed her up and headed out quickly . I think they 're using the trees for cover . I 've done half-a-dozen passes and still nothing . - We need to go on foot . - Thank you , Perk . No , thank you . If you ever need me , use this whistle . She 's out there alone . We 'll find her . I promise . Arion charged the Dagda Mor head-on - the truest act of bravery I have ever seen . And you escaped the henge unharmed ? All because of my brother . He saved me , Father . Gave up his life , but I couldn 't help him . I 'm sure you did everything you could . No , I didn 't . But I 'm gonna try and do my best now . Aine , Arion , my father all gone , and now ... And now you are king .

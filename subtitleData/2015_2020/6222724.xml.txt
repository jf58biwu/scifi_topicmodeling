 Molly : My name is molly woods . I 'm an astronaut . My husband john , a robotics engineer , Created a lifelike robot called a humanich . We adopted the prototype as our son . His name is ethan . This is what we wanted . Everything changed when i went to space On a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . I 'm pregnant . How is that even possible ? The child- - part human , part alien- - Was unlike anything the world had ever seen . How did you get so big so fast ? And he was dangerous . You need to tell them not to come . I can 't . We need to survive . We know this being can somehow access our minds And make us see and do things beyond our control . Molly : Ethan tried to stop him ... I know he 's your son . I won 't hurt him again . ... And sacrificed himself in the process . Run ! Ethan ? We lost ethan . And my other son ... Is still out there . ( kissing , passionate breathing ) Hey . What 's the matter ? Molly : Change scenario . ( electronic chime ) ( electronic whirr ) Let 's get some ice cream . Hot fudge sundae ? With whipped cream and sprinkles . And pistachio ice cream . Pistachio . I miss you , sweetheart . I 'm right here , mom . ( electronic chime ) Male electronic voice : Molly woods , Your virtual reality session is terminated . ( electronic whoosh , molly gasps ) It 's time for your medication . ( sighs ) Molly woods ... It 's time for your medication . Molly woods ... This is my third and final request . ( sighs ) Woman : Can we give you a ride home ? It 's okay . Man : It 's pretty cold outside . You must be freezing . Woman : We aren 't gonna hurt you . Don 't know how old . Maybe ten or 11 ? ( baby crying in distance ) Hasn 't said a word since we found him . ( crying ) four , four and a half feet tall . Wearing a red hooded sweatshirt , jeans , sneakers . About an hour ago . ( crying continues ) Appreciate that , officer . How soon can you get here ? ( door creaking ) ( crying stops ) ( baby babbles ) ( crying ) ( baby cries louder ) Man : Yes . 2087 farmdale road . ( thudding , baby crying ) Ed ... Ed ! Justin ! Justin , your mommy and daddy are right here , baby ! Come on , son , open the door . ( crying continues ) Ed : What the hell is going on here ? Baby , mama 's coming ! ( latch clicks , door creaks ) ( crying continues ) Oh , my baby ! ( crying ) : Oh , sweetie . Oh , baby ... ( mother crying ) ( sighs ) Ed : What the ... ? ( screaming ) Molly : At that point , senator , Having lost all communication with mission control , And knowing that the spores were contained on the seraphim , I made the call to destroy the station . I managed escape pod separation Just 18 seconds before the station 's detonation . It was at that time that You and colleague sean glass Made your way back to earth . Yes , sir . And mr . Glass ? He died ... Very shortly after our return . But you were not affected By the spores ? ( gasping ) No , sir . These microbes- - Or spores , As you call them- - Have been definitively confirmed as alien life-forms ? Yes , senator , and without a doubt , There is life out there . ( quiet , indistinct chatter ) How can you be certain that The threat to earth has been contained ? When the seraphim exploded , The alien microbes were destroyed in space , And no longer pose a threat to us . So , to your best knowledge , No alien life-forms have set foot on the planet earth ? No ets Running around trying to phone home ? ( laughs softly ) That is correct . Well , thanks to your efforts , dr . Woods , We owe you a debt of gratitude for showing extreme bravery In terrifying circumstances . This hearing is now adjourned . Bravo to molly woods . You okay ? Well , i just lied under oath , toby , So , no , i am not okay . Molly , what good would it do To scare the hell out of the public ? Especially when we know the threat has been contained ? What do you think would happen if we told them the truth ? Anarchy . Exactly . I 've been heading up the global security commission For six very long months now . Learned more about pandemics , terrorist threats and ... ( quietly ) : Aliens than anyone should know , If they ever want to sleep at night . Most important thing i 've learned- - People spook easily . And when they spook , They do irrational things , Dangerous things . Woman : General ? The car 's ready to take you and dr . Woods to the airport . Thank you . Come on . Toby ... Are you sure he 's dead ? Had some sort of seizure Right after that couple picked him up a few weeks back . We 've got the body , if you need to see the pictures . No , i don 't need to see . I just had to ask you one last time . He was dangerous , molly . I know . The weight of the world is officially off your shoulders . Get some rest . ( chuckles ) Take a vacation , for god 's sake . When you get back , i 'll take you and john for dinner , And we can all reminisce About my drunken toast at your wedding . ( both laughing ) when you proposed to me ? Hey , well , you can 't blame a guy for trying . Come on . I thought for sure john 'd be here . Where is the competition today ? Where he always is . ( electronic whirring , blipping ) Okay , let 's try this again . ( sighs ) better ? Something 's limiting his sensor pathways . The response isn 't proportionate to the stimulus . The calibration of his hand touch receptors must be off . Probably because of his upgraded body . His responses seem pretty close to normal . Watch yours . It 's not the palm . His fingertip sensitivity 's weak . Your fingertips seem pretty responsive . Julie ... ( doors hiss open ) Molly . Hey . I wasn 't expecting you till tomorrow . I took the last flight out . Thought i 'd surprise you . I have an even better surprise for you . Come here . Hi , molly . Julie . He 's ready . What ? He 's ready ? Yeah . I thought it was gonna be months . No , his-his neural pathways , His-his consciousness , was intact . It-it-it took much less time than i expected . Okay . Here . Go ahead . ( electronic whirring , powering up ) ( gasps ) Ethan . Mom . ( crying ) : Oh , god . Oh ! Oh ! Ethan . ( crying ) : You 're back . Ethan : It feels weird . Weird how ? To be back in my body again , but ... Bigger . Well , that 's ' cause you 're growing up . Can you describe where you 've been ? It was like i was a bird , free to go anywhere , And now i 'm ... Not . Did i die ? No , no , somehow , you uploaded yourself To the cloud , just before the explosion . Turns out , you-you-you can 't die exactly . Because i 'm not human . No . You 're so much more than that . Molly : Ethan , you saved My life on the seraphim . You sacrificed yourself for me . Now , that was brave and very selfless of you . And you may not be ... Technically human , But you 've got more humanity in you Than most people on this planet . And that 's all that matters . You hear me ? I hear you . Molly ( softly ) : Good . You 're my son ... And i love you . No matter what happens . ( sighs ) ( crickets chirping ) Gina ? Yes , molly ? I 'd like to see ... Security cam footage From the week of july 10 . The week before you returned from space ? Yes . That 's right . I 'm sorry , molly , but cameras were offline during that period . ( quiet whirring ) ( whirring ) Gina ... Peter robot has a motion-activated camera , right ? Yes , molly . Can you access that drive ? ( whirring continues ) Same time frame , please . What would you like to see ? All footage of john . And julie . ¶ ¶ Gina , can you go to last time stamp , please ? Is there sound ? Sorry . Peter robot is video only . Can you use facial rec software To analyze and translate ? I 'll try , molly . Gina : " ... Do this anymore . She 's coming home . " " this isn 't right . What we have is special . " " molly has been away a year . " " ... Built a family . " you can 't just take that and throw it away Like it doesn 't mean any ... " " do you love me ? " John : Stop playback . Molly , it 's been over for a while , i swear . It was a mistake . ( exhales ) A mistake ? A mistake ... Is a coding error ... Or a broken plate . This , what you 've been doing ... Is lying ... Over and over And over . Yes , i-i did . I-i lied , but ... It didn 't happen in a vacuum . You-you were not here . I 'm an astronaut . It 's my job . This is not about going to space , molly . There 's a piece of you That 's ... Not in this marriage , And never has been . Well , If you weren 't happy , then you should 've said something , Not screw your lab assistant in our house ! ( sudden banging ) Are you john woods ? Yeah . I have a court order authorizing the seizure Of the humanich . What are you talking about ? The humanich has been declared the property of the u.S. Government For reasons of national security . Ethan ( in distance ) : Dad ! He 's not property- - he 's our son ! Ethan : Mom ! Molly : Ethan ! John : Ethan ! Get your hands off me ! Molly : Ethan ! John : Ethan ! Ethan ... ! Don 't worry ! We 're gonna come get you ! Mom ! Ethan ! Mom ... ! Marko , increase the speed by 15 miles per hour . Marko : That will exceed legal speed limits by 32 % . Okay , override the safeties . Do it . ( knocking on door ) The general 's expecting you . Right this way . Sure . Uh-huh . Well , get ... Get back to me as soon as you can . What 'd you find out ? Where are they taking him ? They can 't do this , toby . This is kidnapping ! I need you both to sit down . Homesec perceives ethan To be a threat to national security . What ? ! What ? That 's ridiculous ! Ethan hacked directly into the isea mainframe- - Which was bad enough- - but then he blew up a building . John : Saving molly And potentially everyone on the planet . For god 's sake , toby , he 's a hero ! He 's a little boy ! Who blew through Terrasoc firewalls like they were tissue paper , molly . There are some genuine concerns here That you can 't ignore . The timing 's A bit convenient , no ? Molly gets into bed With the gsc , an arm of homesec , And now suddenly ethan 's being decommissioned ? Come on , toby , wha ... What 's this really about ? This is much bigger than ethan . The whole humanichs project is being mothballed , john . What ? ! All service bots rated 4.0 or higher Are being seized and decommissioned . Now , this comes from the highest level of homesec . And i have pulled every string , i have made every call There is to make . Now , my hands are tied on this , i 'm sorry . No , no , we 're gonna fight this in court , toby . We 're gonna sue them for unlawful detention ! A national security letter can 't be challenged in court . Really ? I lied for my government under oath ... And this is how they repay my so-called patriotism ? By taking my son ? Ethan is more than a robot- - we all know that- - But in the eyes of the law and the powers that be ... He 's still not human . He 's more human ... Than any one of those asses . Molly ( crying ) : No . ( door opens , shuts ) This isn 't over . Where are you taking me ? Will i see my mom and dad again ? Quiet , robot . Officer ( over speaker ) : Team leader , Stand by for transfer details . ( electricity whirrs , crackles ) Marshal : Hey ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Hello , rabbit . ( birds chirping outside ) ( electronic bell chimes , doors hiss ) I 'm sorry , sir- - this area 's off-limits . I 'm dr . John woods , and this is my lab . I know who you are , And you no longer have authorized access . We 'll see about that . I will forcibly remove you if need be , sir . John . Julie . Thank god you 're here . They-they 've locked us out . They took ethan last night . Okay , let 's not talk about it here . Okay ? This is a nightmare . We need to get hold of ethan 's hard drives Before they 're destroyed . Molly 's devastated about him . And us . I 'm sorry she had to find out that way . ( heavy sigh ) Listen , there 's something i need to tell you , And i want you to listen before you react . Okay ? Homesec contacted me and asked me to run a few tests . What kind of tests ? To see if humanichs Could quickly be adapted for ... Defense purposes . Well , that 's-that 's absurd . It would take years for a humanich to mature enough To handle morally ambiguous situations like combat . You 're going to bypass the protocols . It 's for a good cause , john- - defending our country . We 've seen firsthand the threats that are Out there . That 's how they convinced you ? Service to country ? Julie , this is not patriotic . This is insane . I swore i 'd never let this happen again . I invented the protocols So that humanichs have time to learn right from wrong Through exposure and experience- - it 's crucial . To bypass the protocols is crazy . Worse , it would be dangerous . Don 't you understand ? If it 's not you or me , it 's someone else , And i 'm not gonna sit around and have somebody come in And take over our life 's work . Maybe this is all happening for a reason . If you could just be a little bit more open-minded , We could resume our ... Our life ... And our work and our family , Together . Julie , we don 't have a life together . ( sighs ) i 'm gonna find ethan , And i 'm gonna shut This thing down . ( phone keypad beeps and blips ) It 's julie . I think i may have just really screwed up . ( thunder rumbling ) ( electronic chime ) Gina : Molly , you have an incoming call from john . Decline . ( electronic chime ) Molly , you have an incoming call from john . Molly , please pick up . Molly ... I 'm sorry for the pain i 've caused , But i have to tell you something . I 'm going to call der ... ( car whirrs , powering down ) ( whirring stops ) Marko , is there a technical problem ? Marko : No , john , just waiting for the light to change . We 've stopped on train tracks . ( crossing bell clanging ) no , john , We 're 20 feet from the train tracks . What ... ? ( train horn blaring ) marko , switch to manual drive . Manual drive is offline . Marko ! Unlock the door ! ( train horn blaring ) the door is locked , john , for your safety . Override the safeties , damn it ! Unlock the ... Door ! Med bot : Molly woods , your meds are being dispensed . Woman : Dr. Woods , the purpose Of this review is to determine whether , Following a court-mandated 90-day psych hold , You are ready to be released . It 's been six months since your husband passed away . How 's your time been at our recovery center ? Extremely healing . I am really gonna miss this place . Molly , we 're concerned that you haven 't fully come to terms With the events of last summer . I have . All better . Several drunk and disorderlies . Well , i call that a good time but ... Whatever . Burning down your house . Not the whole house . And i have learned my lesson about playing with matches . Never do that when you 're angry . Attacking a ms . Julie gelineau with a shovel . Well , she screwed my husband And then had the nerve to show up to his funeral . Now , i think I should be committed if i didn 't smack her . Molly , we know this has been A profoundly difficult year for you . We think you 're not quite ready for reentry . Oh . Okay , now i get it . This isn 't a fair hearing . This is putting a rubber stamp to keep me in a rubber room . Now , i 've done every single thing You people have asked me to do . I 've been a good little girl . I 've taken all my meds . I 've done your-your vr therapy . And you 're still not gonna let me out . Which begs the obvious question : Why does the government want to shut me up So badly ? You believe the government is the reason you 're here ? I do . Sam barton , Your friend and physician , testified That she was concerned about your mental health . Sam barton ? Please ! She 'd say anything to save her own ass . She confirmed you had abnormal brain scans Upon returning from your mission . Now , we know extended time in space Can do something to the brain ... Liars . You 're all a bunch of liars ! It 's the board 's recommendation that we extend your hold And reevaluate in 30 days- - That you still pose a serious threat of harm To self and others . That 's ridiculous ! I am not a threat And you know it . This is a cover-up ! That 's what this is ! It 's a cover-up ! And you know it ! Take your hands off of me ! ¶ the air that i breathe ¶ ¶ the wind in the trees ... ¶ ( phone ringing ) ( man groaning ) For real ? ( sighs ) Richter . Val : Criminal bid One-one-nine-six-four .

As always , breakfast is at 7 : 30 . Man : ... I saw him the other night , watching tv . There 's some crazy stuff on the news ... Woman : Stopped reading the news a long time ago . Man : You hear about that woman ? Her belly , blown open . Oh , freaky . Woman : That 's the third one now . Man : Yeah . You should see the photos . I ain 't ever seen anything like it . Woman : Was she shot or stabbed or something ? Man : They don 't know . Looked to me like she kind of exploded From the inside- - i mean , there was blood everywhere , Like one of those horror movies . Woman : That 's just so terrible , just so sad . Man : My cousin sent me this pic . That 's some straight hannibal lecter stuff right there . Oh , my god . No one wants to see that , dave . Look at what dave just showed me . Woman 2 : Ugh .

( click , electronic whine ) Gonna have to take a rain check , dave . ( whirrs , chimes ) Thanks for the bedtime story . Med bot , i need potassium trimanganate and glycerol . Patient 429 , those elements are highly combustible . That 's the idea . ( alarm blaring ) fire ! Sector three ! Emergency evacuation procedure- - go ! Where the hell is dave ?

We can do better , don 't you think ? Still a work in progress . Julie : ( sighs ) well , let 's keep progressing . Where are we ? Uh , working through the ethics algorithms . Still ? Come on , charlie , software coding Is falling behind hardware development . Give me a break . I 'm inventing whole new systems here . I mean , things we didn 't need for ethan . You need to push your team . Jawohl , herr kommandant . Stop . They need to know i 'm in charge . Kidding around like that undermines my authority . Okay . All joking will be suspended until further notice . Sorry . I sound like a jackass . Your team is killing it . Really . Jules , i know you 're under a lot of pressure right now . And , whatever , i can be kind of A jackass myself , sometimes . Want to get a drink later ? I 'm buying . Rain check . I 'm late for dinner . Sure .

Let me go ! ( handcuff clicks , beeps ) Why is it all the good-looking women are crazy ? Well , i could float a few theories . Oh , i bet you could . Hold still . Wow . Dr. Molly woods . An honest-to-goodness space cadet On a 90-day hold at the restwell recovery center . It 's a rest facility . I needed a vacation . You need a new travel agent . You know , mental patients escape often enough , But they 're not normally former astronauts Making a beeline for the closest crime scene . You care to share ? Okay , look ... I think i might know what happened here . I am all ears . Well , can we go somewhere else to chat ? Because they 're gonna be tracking the phone i stole And the car i stole . I hate when that happens . Okay , i know how that sounds . But i am really not a lunatic . Says the lady that broke out of crazy acres , Stole a phone , stole a car ... And then trespassed onto my crime scene . ( car approaches ) Field trip is over , ms . Woods . ( car doors closing ) look ... Please , please , Do not let them take me back to that place . Please !

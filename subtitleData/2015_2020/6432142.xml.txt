 Get away from me . Leave me alone . Make it stop . Make it stop . Make it stop . 0900 hours , weather calm . Arrived at St. Germain Island from the southeast . No apparent flares or signal fires . The contact is not at the rendezvous site . All signs point to the pandemic originating on this island . There are no other options . I must find a cure . I 'll head inland , take a look around . Do you know the way to San Jose ? - What ? - Do you know the way to San Jose ? Is this what it was like ? When you came for me at Arctic Biosystems ? They 'd cleaned most of the mess by the time we got there . No , not the mess . This feeling . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Yeah , you do . This is just the beginning . CDC One , this is Manitou . Sitrep . This is Kyle . This is CDC One . What was that ? We 're asking for a Sitrep , Dr. Sommer . Situation report , remember ? Sorry . Dr. Jordan and Dr. Farragut are still inside the boat , I 'm up on top . Whatever killed these people was fast and aggressive . Any indication this is the Narvik virus ? Just tell the captain we don 't know what the hell happened yet . But it 's not Narvik . You check further down there . Meet up top in 10 . Yeah . I 've got one dead in the engine room . All right . Keep your eyes open . For what ? This place is a tomb . Gotta make sure we got them all accounted for . We 'll check against the manifest . Copy that . Two more in the galley . Same symptoms as the others . You got something ? These two killed each other . What makes you say that ? I 'm seeing stab marks . Both holding weapons . Maybe some kind of psychotic epi- - Don 't touch me . - Just calm down . - Leave me alone . - Please , I am a doctor . - Leave me alone , you freak . - You okay ? - What did you give her ? - Twenty cc 's Midazolam . Are you okay ? - Why 'd you do that ? Midazolam can mask any antibodies she would 've had to become immune to whatever is going on here . - You 're welcome . - I 'm sorry , okay ? But immunity in a situation like this is more than just a clue . It 's everything . When did the passengers start getting sick ? About two , no , three days ago . Right after we got back from the island . - What island ? - I don 't know . It was a side trip . It wasn 't even in the brochure . We just moored offshore , hiked around , went swimming . We spent the day there and we set sail that night . Anyone report feeling strange when they got back ? Not at first . But then on the third day , the screaming started . I just- - I hid in the engine room and I tried to stay quiet . But I could hear them killing each other . Every time I thought it was over , I would hear another scream . I was afraid to fall asleep . I started having these waking nightmares . And so then when you came in wearing that suit , I didn 't know if you were real or if you were just , like , a- - CDC One , this is Manitou . Sitrep . Means they 're asking for a situation report . Yeah , I have done this before . Field autopsies show a consistent pattern . The pathogen overloaded the body 's immune response . - Primarily attacking the digestive system . - Highly unlikely it 's airborne . - We can get out of those biohazard suits . - And you 're sure it 's not the Narvik virus ? The most likely scenario is some infection contracted from the island they visited . Our survivor referred to it as Saint something . St. Germain . It 's about 12 nautical miles northwest of here , just over the horizon . We need to go there . My orders were to investigate a possible Narvik outbreak . Captain , we have 27 people dead onboard that boat . Our assessment is done and our mission is complete . - We still need to get to St. Germain . - My orders in this situation are to leave a tracking buoy on-site and take your team back to Seattle . Then I 'm declaring a national health threat . - Jesus . - Peter , hold on . Coast Guard regulations give me authority to conduct an inspection if I have cause to believe there is a threat to any nearby population center . Seattle is less than 20 hours away . - I 'm ordering you to take us . - You don 't give orders on this ship . I 'm sorry . Wrong choice of words . Bridge , this is the captain . Plot a course to St. Germain . Underway when ready . Make turns for 30 knots . Aye , captain . Let 's be clear on what 's going to happen . Legally I can 't go ashore . Nor can I wait around . I 'm under orders to take your field samples back for lab analysis . So you 'll be on your own . This is the back end of nowhere . So sat-phone and radio service will be extremely limited . There 's no landing strip on the island and it 's well beyond chopper range . So you 'll have to wait until another ship can be dispatched to pick you up . Figure two weeks . Hey , where are you taking me ? Hey , put me down . Put me down . Help ! Help ! What do you want from me ? Come on , put me down . Thanks again for doing this . I know you 'd probably rather be in a bunk on your way back to Seattle right now . I figured I should do something . Yeah . You 're the only person we have here who 's been here before , so ... . We need to know where you and the passengers went . What you ate , drank . Where you went swimming . I don 't know how much I 'll remember . Anything at all will be helpful . You brought a gun ? I 'm from Texas . We don 't go to the bathroom without a gun . Okay . Mind if I ask you a personal question ? Yes . Very much . I did save your life . So that entitles you to pry into my personal life ? Yeah , that 's right . Okay . You think Alan Farragut really blew up that building in Paris ? What the hell kind of a question is that ? People say you knew him . Really well , in fact . Yeah , I thought I did . I think we came this way . Do you remember seeing or hearing anything unusual ? What about the running water ? I 'm not sure . Do we have any idea where we 're going ? We 've been walking around for a while . I 'm not sure . Why are you whispering ? I don 't know . It just feels right to whisper , don 't you think ? Really ? You 're doing this now ? Can we just focus on the task at- - Oh , my God . What the hell is that ? Dwarf Cottontail . Pretty common at this latitude . Although they usually come with eyes . Bring the rabbit . So there are animals here . No ! Leila , wait . Leila . Leila . Leila . Stop . Leila . Leila . Look out . Look , I don 't know who you are , but I 'm not here to harm you . My name is Julia . If you would just hear me out . Do you know the way to San Jose ? Leila . Somebody help me . - This is going to hurt . - Oh , really ? Gee , you 're good . Doctors really are the worst patients . There we go . Oh , my God . Sorry . Swallowed my gum . Oh , my God . Not too bad . Nasty looking though . Gonna leave a scar . Only if you do a shitty job sewing it up . But I got the shakes , doc . Sorry , but infection 's your biggest worry here . Thanks , but I don 't think that 's gonna be an issue . Right . You 're a germ commando now . Ever since that thing at Arctic Biosystems . What thing ? I heard you and your team went all Navy SEAL . Burned the place to the ground to contain the outbreak . Yeah , something like that . Been dying to ask you about it . Ever since I recognized you back in Seattle . You recognized me ? Yeah , you 're quite the celebrity now at the CDC . Jumping into every crisis imaginable . That 's why they call you " Hot Zone . " They call me what ? Now , does the pointy end go down or up ? - Never mind , I 'll figure it out . - Oh , you are such an ass . Pointy end goes down , I knew it . Come on , you know you 're gonna tell me eventually . I haven 't seen Alan Farragut in a year , okay ? I don 't know where he is or what he 's doing and frankly I don 't care . You okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . I fell into this animal trap . That 's a punji trap and it 's not used to catch rabbits . - It 's used to catch humans . - See ? I did see someone . - Maybe . - Yeah ? What did you see exactly ? Well , I 'm not sure , but I thought I saw a woman in the brush and I guess I- - You panicked . If there is someone they may 've eaten the same thing that killed the people on that boat . Which makes it all the more important that we find out what it is . Isolate it so we can treat them . Leila , I want you to take us to where you folks ate . That 's the most likely place someone might have started sampling the local flora . Leila ? Are you all right ? There 's some- - There 's- - There 's something over there . I don 't see anyone . At the base of- - At the base of the trees . It 's smiling at me . I don 't think you need to be afraid . It 's all going to be okay . No , I see it too . Okay . Okay , wait here . It 's human , adult , probably female . And she 's not alone . Leila ? Leila ! Do you know the way to San Jose ? I don 't understand . Do you know the way to San Jose ? You mean from here ? Do you know the way to San Jose ? Yes . No . What the hell do you want me to say ? Okay , okay . Okay , yeah , yes , I know the way . You know I know the way . Yes , I know the way . No . Leila ? Leila ? Here . More blood . That 's , call it 20 feet from the last drops ? Relatively large drops . Major blood vessel likely . But not arterial . - She can 't be that far ahead of us . - It 's gonna be dark soon . - Where the hell could she be ? - I 've got a good guess . No . No . Texas . Please don 't . No . Stop . Stop . Please don 't . Please don 't . No . No . No . No . Please don 't . No . I knew one day you 'd come . We should split up to look for Leila . Cover more ground independently . Really , Hot Zone ? How much ground you think you 're gonna cover with that foot ? - My foot 's gonna be fine , all right ? - Don 't try to pull that shit . You 're going to deny what I 'm capable of ? Immunity from infection and an extraordinary recovery system hasn 't made you special , Sarah . Just reckless . It 's a gift , Peter . Here we go . More blood . A lot more . This is more of a pool than individual droplets . She was held here for a while . If she 's losing blood at this rate , she 's going to bleed out soon . - Dr . Sommer , are you hurt ? - What ? - Your arm . - No , I don 't think so . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Turn off your lights . - What ? - Just do it . - What 's going on ? - Look . It 's out in the trees . See it ? How many rounds you got in that gun , Texas ? Not nearly enough . Please , come outside . I promise you won 't be harmed . Well ? It 's either that or go out like Butch and Sundance . - What the hell does that mean ? - What ? You 've never seen Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ? What kind of American are you ? Grab your things . Let 's go . I 'm Dr. Peter Farragut , with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control . My name is Anne . You should know you 're trespassing on private property . There 's a dead woman inside . She was murdered . By someone on this island . I 'm sorry . Was she a friend ? Yeah . There 's no need to lie . All right then , we just met her . - How 's that ? - You need to come with us . - Why ? - The island is dangerous . - And we can offer you shelter . - What about Leila 's body ? We need it . There 's no time . - What are you afraid of ? - We 'll explain everything . Now , please , come with us . Okay . Let 's start over . You know my name . What do I call you ? Caleb . All right , Caleb . Can I get some water ? You 're gonna have to help me with that . I didn 't come here to hurt you or anyone else . You 've heard of the outbreak on the mainland ? The one they 're calling TXM-7 . We have reason to believe the TXM-7 pandemic began here on this island . - There 's no one sick here . - Maybe not now . But 30 years ago , a chain of events was set in motion . Right here . I may be able to find a cure , but I need answers . Since when are your kind interested in mortal problems ? Since we started dying too . Bullshit . Left shoulder . Take a look . I 'm dying . We didn 't mean to trespass , but this is an emergency situation . We 're talking about a virulent pathogen . Coast Guard food was terrible . Beans in the chili , I mean , that 's just wrong . I 'm not accusing anyone of anything , but Leila was murdered , that much is clear . No . Never seen that many bodies in one place . We need access to your facility and personnel . I 'm afraid we can 't allow that . Our membership has cut all ties with the outside world . Come on , now . You 're talking to us . Doesn 't hurt , does it ? This is a sanctuary . The people who 've joined us , they 're trying to get away from people like you . - Sister Amy . - Are we really that bad ? You 'd remind them of things they left behind . And many of those are painful . You 're doctors . I 'm sure you don 't want to cause pain . No . We don 't . And please believe me when I tell you that we have nothing but the utmost respect for your beliefs . You 're lying again . - Don 't believe I caught your name , ma 'am . - You weren 't introduced . I know you want to protect us . I can assure you we don 't need your protection . Brother Michael provides for the safety of our physical , as well as spiritual lives . - And who 's Brother Michael ? - He 's a man . Just like you . No more or less . I 'd like to speak with him . You don 't speak to Michael . He speaks to you . And when does that happen ? Why , right now , Dr. Farragut . Doctors Farragut , Sommer , and Jordan , right ? I 'm Michael . Welcome . Allow me to return your credentials . I 'm very glad Anne found you before too long . This island is quite dangerous outside these walls . Home to two species of black bear and the Labrador wolf . That 's why we keep the perimeter electrified . There 's something more dangerous than wolves and bears . - Someone killed our friend . - Friend ? Please sit . Our acquaintance . I suppose you might find the distinction trivial but we believe words have truth in them , we believe that they have meaning . Acquaintances . Friends . Family . Lovers . Those are definitions , not labels . But here I am counseling you and you 're not here for that , are you ? No . But we are here to find a truth as well . A medical truth , but a truth nonetheless . - So I gather . - Oh , yeah ? You listen in on our little conversation with the ladies ? I love to eavesdrop . It 's a terrible habit , I know . I picked it up from my mother , who was notorious for hanging about keyholes . I 'm afraid I couldn 't help myself . Speaking of helping , may want to ask your people to stop eating the food . How 's that ? Victims on the ship ingested something on this island . We don 't know that for sure , but your food and water supply may be contaminated by a toxic metabolite . We 've been growing our own food for years with no ill effect . Nonetheless , I would strongly urge you to refrain from eating or drinking anything until we can run some tests . I accept your concern in the spirit of generosity with which I know you offer it . There 's still the matter of who killed Leila , our acquaintance . Any ideas ? I told you , it 's dangerous outside . Yeah , but we think it was more of a two-legged danger . Probably more than one . Are there any other people on this island of yours ? I 'll have Anne prepare rooms for you . Sleep in peace , all of you , as our guests . We 'll talk in the morning . What the hell was that ? That was the head of a cult . Keep your voice down . I got a feeling he 's not the only one who likes to eavesdrop around here . What do we do ? We get some sleep . And tomorrow we figure out what the hell we 've stumbled into . Thank you . - For what ? - Not killing me . It smells good . Tastes good too . I 'm looking for someone . I wonder if you could help me . Point me in the right direction ? I 'm looking for a man named Alan Farragut . What ? You know him ? Is he here on the island ? He 's here . Can you take me to him ? Please , I have to see him . I can . But you may not like what you find . Thank you .

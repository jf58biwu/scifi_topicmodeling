FEAR THE WALKING DEAD Season 03 Episode 03 Title : " TEOTWAWKI " I was in the dining room dry-canning some beans When an angel fell from the damn sky and crashed in my backyard . I screamed and ran out there . And there she was , All of 12 , A lump on the ground , Holding on to a giant lawn umbrella . She had jumped off the roof . Thought the thing would hold her . She broke her arm in two places , But she never cried . Charlene embodied the spirit of this place ... An always-ready , never-quit , Get-it-right-this-time spirit . And she would have ... If she wasn 't risking her life for the unprepared . Pat , thank you . Hello . I just want to introduce my family . I 'm Madison clark , and these are my children , Nick and Alicia .

We just wanted to say thank you for sheltering us And thank you for your generosity . We will repay it . Thank you . We 've all lost . We share that . And grieving 's hard , But it 's important that we process it ... More important to prepare , jake . - Good point ! - I-I-I 'm sorry . There is a time and place for mourning , and patty is owed that . But who brought down the helicopter ? - We aim to find out , Vernon . - When ? - We 're gonna get to the bottom of this . - What 's your timeline ? - Jeremiah . - Please . Nothing 's changed , Vernon . Make no mistake , we 're in a wartime posture here . We tasked alpha station to scout the crash site . When we know what we 're dealing with , we 'll act . If it 's some wing nut , we 'll act . If it 's a larger challenge , we will act . Payback , Vernon . Yeah ! That 's what my father means . Whatever this threat is , large or small , We will make this right . Hey , we 'll meet our justice When we know what it is we 're dealing with . We can 't afford to lose ourselves . We 're more than a mob . We have to be something hopeful in this world . Like my father says , if you plan for the future ... Plan for a better one . Freeloader . Excuse me ? You know the fable " the ant and the grasshopper " ? Hey , what 's your problem ? Let it go . Let it go . They should be harassing troy , not us . I think they would be if they knew what he had done . Madison and Alicia , I 'm gretchen trimbol , Vernon 's daughter . Saw you at the meeting . Welcome . I 'd shake , but it wouldn 't be sanitary . Damn hangnail can take you down these days , You 're not careful , you know ? I 'm so sorry for your loss . I wish I 'd have had the pleasure of knowing travis . Thank you , gretchen . Hey , Alicia , the rest of christ rizen and I were wondering If you wanted to join us for bible study . Oh , we 're not really ... when is it ? Tonight . One hour , two , tops . Music , punch , and the lord , of course . What , uh , is christ rizen ? Oh , sorry . Christ rizen is our band . That 's terry and gabe . You 'll meet geoff if you come . We 're jewish . Cool . We 'll do old testament . Corral at 5 : 00 . We need supplies , Nick . Water , weapons . We must be ready to leave . They 're going to take the cuffs off soon . You can walk around and see the place . No . Eat , luciana . I can 't forget what they did . I know . As soon as they free me , we go . I just want us all to feel safe in one place . I had a chance to make that happen . I had a chance to kill him . But ... That would not have made us safe . And you know this . This is not you , Nick . You 're not a killer . How 's luciana ? Oh , still alive . I liked your speech . I liked how you said his name . Travis . It makes him matter . Makes him real . He was real . That 's not why you said it , though . It wasn 't out of grief . It was pointed . You wanted to remind us that you 're a victim , too . You feel like a victim ? Are you analyzing me now ? No . What did you do in the old world ? Guidance counselor . At a high school ? Oh . I never attended . " certain social aspects of academia Proved challenging for troy . " You must have been lonely . No , no . No , I , uh ... I had this place . Everything that I do is in service to this place . Does your father believe that ? Yeah , he understands . You know , complicated problems call for complicated solutions . Killing people 's not complicated . It 's simple . Do you see ? You understand this world . You understand me . That 's why I picked you . But I didn 't ... i didn 't pick Nick . He comes with me . Package deal . Why were you separated ? Why was he with strangers and not his family ? He doesn 't deserve his place here . I think you know it . He 'll earn it . That was made this morning , troy . Hey , hey , hey , hey , Dante 's not gonna be happy ... Hey ! Ah ! Nothing . You 're making a mistake . Huh ! You 're making a mistake ! This is a mistake ! Victor ... Don 't . They don 't want us here . Most of them don 't mind . The ones who do , we win them over . - You want to win over troy ? - Work in progress . In the meantime , both of you stay away from him . Not sure I can do that . The hell you can 't , Nick . You don 't know what sets him off . He doesn 't know what sets him off . Okay , but if we stay , we need to do something . What does that mean ? I 'm doing something . No , what do you mean , Nick ? What are you gonna do ? Do you want my knife ? You gonna do something ? All I 'm saying is that ... We should start over somewhere else , okay ? Like find a house , grow crops . We don 't have to stay here , that 's all . - Farming 's more your style . - We have options . - We 're not leaving . - Why ? - We 're not leaving ! - Why are you so convinced That this is the place , mom ? Because it 's all we have . Because there 's no place better . Because we hauled you out of that hell hole and travis died because of it . Luciana won 't be safe here . They let her in . What if they make her go ? You 'll have a choice to make . Something 's wrong . That 's not many klicks for mccarthy to cover . We should have heard back by now . How many times did you and charlie fly that route ? Six times in four weeks , maybe . People tend to knock before they enter . Or is this different back in angel city ? Front door was open . What do you need , Madison ? Reassurance . You took us in and I thank you for that , but ... And you are welcome . But some people here resent us . Well , that 's natural . You are strangers . We 're not strangers to troy . What did he do ? Broke into our place , threatened Nick . I 'd like you to keep a leash on your son . And I 'd like you to help us with the other people . The ranch ain 't my autocratic plaything . Its residents don 't bend to my whims and wills and fancies . It 's a place for free people who only ask for help When they need it . I 'm asking . I need it . You a hard woman to like , Madison ? I 'm extremely Goddamn hard to like When someone threatens my family , and that 's what troy did . That 's fact . If jake hadn 't shown up at the depot , We 'd be dead . That 's fact . And it 's something no one here seems to give a shit about . Whoa , whoa , whoa . No need to curse . He murdered people , and he called it science . Maybe the ranch should know that . Yeah , I 'm starting to grasp why folks ' fondness fails When it comes to you , Madison . Dad , she 's justified ... uh ... If my people take umbrage at your presence , That 's on you . I won 't let anyone drown Without teaching them how to swim . Jake , show her the lectures . Did troy hurt you ? Has he always been this way ? I 'll take care of him . Okay . Yeah , you and your dad keep saying that . Thank you ... For saving Alicia . Well , she saved me , too . She ... All right , I 'm going to put on some coffee . You 're going to need it . You worried about the helicopter ? Nah . It 'll turn out to be some crackpot scavenger . Whoever it is , I want to meet him . Our country is ablaze . If only our ancestors can see the chaos of Modern America . You gonna ride ? Dad used to take me to the equestrian center . No , I 'm not riding . I 'm waiting for gretchen . Going to her first bible study . We stay , we should get to know them . You 're invited . So ... Is that what you want ? You want to stay ? No . But I 've seen what it 's like out there , and it 's all just different circles of hell . Why not this one ? Sorry what mom said . It wasn 't fair . It 's not wrong . Bad time to form a conscience . What happened to you out there ? the boar 's back . Keeps digging up the fence posts to get to the cabbage . Could use an extra pair of hands tracking it tonight . Stay away from Madison and her family . They 're my friends . They came here under my invite . They trust me . They came here not to get eaten . I wouldn 't flatter yourself . Yeah , but they 're staying 'cause I said I 'd protect them From you . And how are you going to do that ? Please don 't do this . Troy , please . I 'm the one that still believes in you . Well , I don 't need you to anymore . Yeah , you do . You do . If the ranch knew what you really are ... And what am I , jake ? Do you really think that you were helping those people out at the depot ? I think I was helping all of us . Troy ... When dad 's gone , This is all on us . We have to take care of this place . We have to lead ... - Together . - Yeah . But I need you to do something for me . I need you to stay away from the clarks . Do you hear me ? Yep . I hear you . Do you mean it ? I always mean it , jake . How much further ? We 're here . You first . All right , everybody . Get your study materials . Greens to the new girl . She is one of God 's chosen people . This is not what I expected . Go your way . Eat your bread with joy And drink your wine with a merry heart , For God has already accepted your works . You have turned my mourning into dancing . You 've removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness . You said " sackcloth . " ♪ ♪ " we can be heroes " playing ... So , where is Geoff ? Say hi , Geoff . If you 're gonna plan for the future ... Plan for a better one . Cut it . I look like an asshole out there . I didn 't know what the hell I was saying . I told you to use the cue cards . I don 't need Goddamn cue cards . - I know my lines , okay ? - Okay . Now , what I want you to do is pick up that sniveling idiot . Why don 't you pick him up ? I 'm going back to the house . No , you 're staying right here . Hey ! You 're staying right here . We 're gonna do another . - You hear me ? - Enough ! It isn 't enough . It 's enough when I say it 's enough . - I 'm tired ! - You 're not tired . You 're thirsty , that 's what you are . - You 're Goddamn thirsty . - You 're hurting me ! Jake , tend to your brother . Let 's do this again , okay ? - One more take . We 'll do it again . - Sorry , no . See what you started ? Jeremiah , let her go . Why don 't you just shut up , okay ? Just shut your damn mouth . Not my finest moment . How far did you get ? I didn 't get through the first tape . It 's funny , where we start and where we end up . What happened to their mom ? Troy 's mom . Jake 's was my first wife . I was married twice before I gave up The sacred institution . Did she die ? Yeah . Before . My father was a drunk , like her . The booze kill him ? In a way , yeah . Drink took tracy . Got real ugly at the end . Troy tended to her , and ... Fed her and cleaned her . She hated him for it . Where were you ? Selling buckets . I suffered the same affliction . No , no , no , no . It was the night before we signed the paperwork For the fortuna resort . I 'm positive . It was that night , because we were never sure We were gonna close the deal . Thomas 's counter was aggressive . Either way , the sun had come up , And you and thomas were making crepes chocolates on a bonfire of God knows what . It was the wood case of the vino hormaechea ' 89 . And all the while I was singing juan gabriel to a cactus . yeah , that 's right . Oh , man . I 'm ... I 'm assuming ... Thomas did not ... ? Huh . So , you escaped this hotel in this crazy woman 's car , and ... all you have with you are your wits and charms and this crunchy suede coat ? don 't forget my good looks , Dante . Well , it 's nice to be back with a ... like mind . Salud . Salud . He wants to know where you 're from . El Sereno , Los Angeles , California , America , North america , Earth . Geoff wants to know what it 's like out there . Chaos . Ruin . And it changes you . Not like Geoff . Something worse . Can I ask geoff something ? Sure . Who are the ottos ? Our founding family . They made this place before most of us were even born . Jeremiah saw what was coming . And how long you guys been here ? It varies . Most came when the event began . Geoff showed up a week after t.E. He was the first one we saw like that ... Dead alive . Geoff claims he 's from flagstaff , But I doubt it . He 's indifferent on the ottos , Except troy . Geoff is not a fan . Troy took Geoff 's body . Troy 's done a lot worse than that . Troy and the militia do what we can 't . They protect us . You can 't rely on the troys of the world . Not anymore . We 've been behind the fence since this started , Alicia . We can 't do what he does . Sometimes you have to handle your own shit . Geoff wants to know What bad stuff have you done ... out there ? I killed a man . How did it feel ? Easy . Hey ! Hey ! This man was cartel before the fall . His function was to take from honest people and to kill those who refused . Which he did . See , in my world now , there is no room for such people . No , no , no , no . AH ! Aah ! Hey ! Hey ... Dime ... Did you truly think that we were friends in the old world ? We made each other money . That 's very American of you , victor . I know why you 're here . It 's why you were always here . You want what is not yours . You wanted my people 's land , and now you want my water . Everyone wants your water . Not everyone is quite as thirsty as you . I 'm not here to take from you . Some food , shelter , a cocktail , perhaps . - That would suffice . - No , no , no . Nothing suffices . Nothing satiates . You cannot help your need to take . It is in your nature . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! You need me , Dante ! You need me ! Hold it . Como ? You 're begging for an attack . You can 't sell so close to your source . It 's only a matter of time before they try to take it , not me . - Oh , you wish to serve me ? - Yes , I wish to serve . - You wish to advise me ? - Yes , please . Listen to me . You must sell off-site . And for that , you need transport . Guns and more men And ammunition to guard that transport . I can organize that . Water is the currency now . How could I ever trust a thief ? I never stole from you . You stole from Thomas . We can work this out . Did ... did Thomas die believing that you loved him ? I did love him . You will say anything . Ah ! Aah ! No , please ! Please ! No ! Why are you doing this ? So you suffer . You exploit everything that you touch . And for that , you owe a debt . You will work it off . You will feel just like the people that you 've taken from . You will feel powerless . ♪ ♪ " Once in a while " playing in background ♪ ♪ A bunch of us are going hunting .

My tapes didn 't make me the lightning rod I hoped to be , But enough people woke , invested in the vision . We call this the pantry . Some say this mess we 're in is revelations , God 's vengeance . I 'll tell you what it is . It 's an opportunity . A new life . A chance to make amends . I broke troy in that old world . In this one , he has a purpose . We all do . And nothing heals a family More than that . We will build something better than before . It won 't be easy , Madison . You think your family 's up for it ? Absolutely . The ground 's soft . You could dig a grave real easy . I mean , people would suspect you , but ... Well , they really wouldn 't know for sure . I wonder how long it 'll take you to turn . Eighty-seven minutes . Eighty-seven minutes given my weight , BMI , age . You know , if you do do it , You should time it . Journal 's in my pocket . You are not a scientist . Time it . Nick ... Please .

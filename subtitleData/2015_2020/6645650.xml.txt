 NOAH : Previously on Heroes Reborn ... ( GROANING ) QUENTIN : Where you been , man ? I 've been looking for you . You 're alive . It worked , didn 't it ? That 's awesome ! What ? What 's time travel like ? I hope this is good news . QUENTIN : You know that baby we 've been looking for over the past year ? Turns out it 's two teenage wonder twins . Bennet 's gonna take us right to ' em . Hero Truther , my name is Taylor Kravid . My mother is Erica Kravid , CEO of Renautas . She 's not who she says she is , and her company is not what it claims to be . ( GRUNTS ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GUNSHOT ) Why were you trying to kill me ? MALINA : You can at least tell me why you tried to kill yourself . LUKE : I used to believe in something . I had a purpose ... A reason for living , but then I lost it . DEARING : Sunstone Manor . Gotta switch places with you if I 'm gonna pass you off as a bounty . You got my money , remember ? I don 't have any powers . You drink this , swab will read a false positive . SURESH : Time was designed to move in one direction . Ever forward , allowing our lives to be a series of choices , threaded one after another . ( COUGHS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) What the hell is this ? Did you double cross me ? Calm down and welcome back . Try the cuffs . SURESH : These choices define who we are , whether it is to protect the family we cherish , the truth we know and the memories we hold on to , the past that we cannot leave behind , or the search for the answers to our own private mysteries . But meddle with the laws of time , twist it , bend it , and even the smallest of butterflies can alter history itself , turn friend into foe , causing the most unexpected of consequences and the greatest tidal wave of change . I better go check on my mom . Is it safe for you to go back to the hospital ? I don 't know . But I 'm ready for whatever 's facing me . Well , no matter what , I believe in you . ( CHUCKLES ) Before we go back to the real world , I got something for you . How did you know ? Well , I just saw you looking at it at the souvenir shop by the Eiffel Tower , and I thought it 's a good way to remember our trip . ( HORN HONKS ) He 's on his way . Yes . Just have to tie up some loose ends first . ( PHONE BEEPS ) ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) It 's been hours since we lost contact with the Gateway Team . I 'm worried that the engineer ... He knows the consequences of not meeting his deadlines . He 'll be on schedule . And the status of our teleporter ? We 're ... We 're looking for alternates , but I ... Everything is under control , Richard . RICHARD : With less than a week , I 'm concerned . ERICA : Oh , don 't be such a crybaby . Even if we had Hiro Nakamura , he 'd be redundant . The boy has his power now , and he 's being delivered to us . He guarantees our future . ( SIGHS ) My grandfather used to say , " The secret to a good kill is the element of surprise . " ( GUNSHOT ) This morning , a commercial jetliner made an emergency landing after its navigation system went awry . Experts say a geomagnetic anomaly may be to blame , as true north appears to be shifting ... Your mom 's one tough lady . I know . This is the second instance in the past week of an airliner going off course . ( TV MUTES ) I 'm fine . Now , about what happened when I left , I 'm sorry . You had every reason to be upset . Mom , it 's fine . No , let me get this out . I just wanted you to have a normal life . That 's what a mom does , protects her child . Mom , I can handle it . I know , and that 's why you are ready for me to tell you about who you are . Okay . The comic book you love ... 9th Wonders ? You have more in common with your favorite character than you think . Hiro Nakamura ? Yep , him . What ... What do you mean , like , I have more powers in common with him ? ( SHUDDERS ) You have exactly his powers . But Hiro Nakamura 's a time traveler . I can 't time travel . NOAH : As a matter of fact , Nathan , you can . Right now I have to get you and your sister to Odessa . That 's the most important thing . Then what ? Look , I know this is very complicated . Complicated ? Okay , Claire Bennet 's my mom . I have a sister I 've never even met before . Hiro Nakamura , the master of time and space , is my dad . And I 'm only , technically , a year old . How is that complicated ? Oh , right , I knew all this , but Caspar erased it . We 're talking about global extinction . That 's what we have to stop here . I know this is a lot to process . But why don 't you take a few minutes , give Noah and I some time to talk ? Okay ? Yeah . You still haven 't answered my question . Do I ever think about fate ? Yeah . Well , we found each other , and you had a picture of some kid that I met , so yeah , I mean , it must mean something . It means that we were destined to meet , so you could help me find this boy . You sound very certain . I am . ( GIRL GIGGLING ) You said you lost your purpose . But what do you mean ? Like , lost how ? I don 't want to talk about it . ( CLICKS TONGUE ) You know what I hate ? Tomatoes . They contaminate the entire sandwich . They spread their seeds everywhere , infecting everything . Besides , fruits do not belong in sandwiches . ( CHUCKLING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) CARLOS : You sure this is going to work ? As long as you stay away from the Director . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Check your coms . Test , test , test . It 's working . How about yours ? All good . CARLOS : This Director , what 's his deal ? DEARING : Word is he gets into your head . Hey , Bonnie . Pretty busy today . BONNIE : ( CHUCKLING ) Yeah , new mandate from above . Bonus fees for time travelers and other high value powers . Just the one today , Mr. Dearing ? He was wearing this crazy suit when I got him . You still catalog these ? Was kinda hoping to keep it as a trophy . Now , Mr. Dearing , you know we got to catalog everything . Although it 's been so busy around here lately . I 'm sure no one would notice . Open your mouth . ( DEVICE TRILLING ) ( DEVICE BEEPS ) MAN : He 's good . Can I get my money ? Once the paperwork 's done , you 'll be out of here . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( SHOUTING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) TAYLOR : No ! ( TIRES SCREECH ) MALINA : ( CHUCKLES ) WOW . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) At the convent , uh , Sister Pat had a pickup truck , but it never did anything like this . ( CHUCKLES ) You know , eating that crap is gonna rot your teeth . I 'm making up for lost time . My grandmother never allowed candy , even on movie night . It sounds weird , but ... It was the one time where I actually felt connected . Beyond the walls . Well , I don 't think that sounds weird . My wife and I , we used to love taking our son , Dennis , to the movies . Popcorn , candy , the whole shebang , just to help him feel like a regular kid . And did he ... Feel like a regular kid ? He did . Yeah . He liked the funny stuff . Any time someone would fart ... ( LAUGHS ) He had such a great laugh . All right , give me one . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Don 't worry . It 's not a problem . They 're shipping out all the essentials , the Evos they need . So tell me , what happens in here ? We evaluate you and determine whether you 're critical to the organization . And if I 'm not ? The Director will explain everything when he arrives . This way . So what 's your power ? ( GASPS ) You are so predictable , Taylor . Did you really think you could get away with this ? That I wouldn 't find you ? Did you really think you could get away with mass murder ? When that nurse put you in my arms at the hospital , I loved you . And I 've tried to protect you from the world . Why can 't you just trust that I know what 's best ? ( CHUCKLES ) You 're good , Mom . Almost got me . But here 's the thing . You took Francis . You killed Evos to suit your own purpose . And this whole emotional manipulation thing isn 't gonna work on me anymore . Who did you send the files to ? I 'd rather die than tell you anything . Who are you ? What is this ? ( GRUNTS ) Sorry for the subterfuge . We had to be sure that we could trust you . Are you Hero Truther ? I 'm just one of the hunted . I need to find Francis Culp . Renautas is holding someone very important to us as well . The founder of our movement . The original Hero Truther . How do we get them back ? We are hoping you can help with that . " A population can only be preserved " if there are resources to maintain its survival . " Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus . Two hundred years ago , he was right . Why didn 't we listen ? Did I ever tell you that I grew up on a farm ? I don 't believe you mentioned that , Miss Kravid . What we grew was what we ate . Farm to table . It was just our way of life . Did you find my daughter yet ? She was last spotted in Los Angeles . ERICA : A redhead . Very clever . Well , she 's resourceful , I 'll give her that . I have a couple of men on it . Will you just stop ? You 're decimating it . Taylor knows how to go off the grid . You have to outsmart her . We believe she 's contacted Hero Truther . They 've been trying to find Micah Sanders , their so-called leader . Do you think they have any idea what we 're using Micah for ? Just do whatever you have to do to stop them and bring me my daughter . EMILY : Decided yet ? Peppermint 's always been my favorite . ( CHUCKLES ) It 's from Paris . It 's from my boyfriend . He 's so thoughtful . You should treasure those memories . They 're what define us . Without them , you 're a lost soul . First loves , they only happen once . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( BELLS JINGLE ) Oh , be right back . Shh . Care to join me ? Whatever you think Tommy did ... Stop talking . CASPAR : Miss , how much do I owe you ? Don 't do anything stupid . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Miss ? Get rid of him . EMILY : Uh , that 'll be $ 1.75 . Tails . Bad luck . Why don 't you take a seat ? CASPAR : Calm down . Join him . Now ! Dearing , can you hear me ? ( DEVICE BEEPING ) I took care of the guard , and I 'm on my way downstairs . Where are you ? DEARING : Still waiting on the paperwork . DIRECTOR ON PA : Good afternoon , this is your Director . Cliché as it may sound , this is the first day of the rest of your life , so think about how you can effectuate positive growth . Focus your breath . Find your safest , happiest place . Calm your mind , and let my voice guide you . ( MAN SCREAMING ) Take a deep breath in and a deep breath out . ( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) Continue breathing . Take another deep breath in , and let it out . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Today , nobody is in charge of your happiness but you . Take a deep breath in ... You weren 't kidding about this place . DIRECTOR : And a deep breath out - No bars on the windows . Why is no one leaving ? CARLOS : There 's another building around back . I 'm gonna see if Jose 's there . You know what the holdup is here ? It never usually takes this long . New protocol requires a DNA signature . A what ? Oh , they 're just double checking . You know , making sure Evos aren 't turning in Evos . We 'll get you swabbed , and you 'll be on your way . ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah . ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( GLASS SHATTERS ) ( BREATH ES HEAVILY ) ( GRUNTS ) ( THUDS ) BONNIE : Take him to the Director . ( BANGS ) QUENTIN : That bad , huh ? You 're a hard dude to find , man . Ah , I guess . ( SIGHS ) Ironic , huh ? Meant to save the world , but you can 't get yourself a chocolate bar . ( BAR CLATTERS ) Thanks . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Excuse me . Sure . Hey . JOANNE : Your girlfriend and I are having ice cream . Do you want to join us ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Damn it . CASPAR : I can see you 're in pain . I know how it feels to be overcome with anguish and grief . All you want , even for a moment , is to feel some relief . A release . To be unburdened . I can give you that . It 's what I do . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) You see that penny on the floor ? ( BREATHES SHAKILY ) CASPAR ' . Huh ' ? Hey . All you have to do is pick ... Stop . ( CHUCKLES ) It 's about time . Let them go . They 're innocent . Tommy , I 'm handling this . ( CASPAR GRUNTS ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( GRUNTS ) ( cows CLATTER ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( EMILY SCREAMS ) ( CASPAR GRUNTS ) ( THUDS ) ( WHIMPERS ) LUKE : Stay in the car . ( SHAKILY ) Please , I 'll do whatever you want , but don 't hurt her . I thought killing you would be enough . Or maybe you need to watch your little girlfriend die first . ( CRYING ) No , please ! ( DOOR OPENS ) ( BELL JINGLES ) ( GASPS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( CHUCKLES ) I was hoping that you would have gone up in flames along with our house . But I should 've known . Follow-through was never your strong suit . I see you 've embraced your powers . Put down the gun , Jo . ( EMILY SHRIEKS ) None of this is gonna bring back Dennis . All the blood we spilled , Joanne , it was for nothing . JOANNE : Don 't tell me you didn 't feel better when you killed them . LUKE : I didn 't . Liar ! I only did it for you . When Dennis was alive , did you know that you were one of them ? None of that matters anymore , Jo . Just put down the gun . JOANNE : Tell you what , I 'll shoot her , you kill me . Everyone wins . And I 'll be with Dennis . ( SCREAMS ) No ! ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) ( TOMMY BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( BELL JINGLES ) ( BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( SIRENS WAILING ) ( TIRES SCREECH ) Get in . Deirdre , show us the evidence you 've gathered . Turn on the lights . What are these ? Photos of the missing . His name is Micah . He was our leader . Micah has the power to manipulate anything digital , anything electronic . My mother has him , doesn 't she ? She 's using him , and we need to stop her . What are the leads on his location ? ( BEEPING ) TAYLOR : Stop ! I know this place . It belonged to the people who owned the mine my grandfather worked in until he died . When my mother made her first million , that 's the first property she bought . DIRECTOR : Visualize the place where you 're the most at peace . Your happy place . A beautiful place . What do you see ? What do you hear ? ( CHUCKLES ) Who do you see ? JOSE : ls there some superhero signal How do you detect trouble ? That 's the thing . We sense it . Remember when Nick was bothering you at school ? I spoke to the teacher , and the teasing stopped . I just didn 't tell you . I knew you did that for me . And now we can fight crime together . I 'm ready . As long as we 're together . Jose , come on , we have to leave . El Vengador , the enemy 's here ! He 's found our secret location ! Dad ! Come on , let 's go ! Come on . JOSE : Stop ! Let me go ! Jose , it 's me , Carlos . Come on ! Come on . I want to stay ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Father Mauricio , let 's get you out of here . I 've seen the other side , my son . Come on , let 's go ! Why would we leave ? We 've all found what we want right here . What ? ( DOOR OPENS ) Jose , I 'll be back . Dearing , help . ( SCREAMS ) ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( FEEDBACK WHINES ) DIRECTOR : Interesting . You are very interesting . You spend your life hiding who you are and hating your powers . You know , as the Director , I ... I 've seen all kinds of people , but a cop turned bounty hunter ? That 's ... That 's a first . Oh , hunting your own kind for personal gain , for money , that 's ... That is a new low . At least I have a higher purpose . You are not worthy of being saved , my friend . We really are our own worst enemy , aren 't we ? Well , I leave it to you to determine your own punishment . ( GUNSHOT ) The Director will be with you in a moment . ( SIGHS ) ( GROANING ) DIRECTOR : Well , you have caused some drama here today . ( GRUNTS ) Get out of here , grab your people , and go ? ( LAUGHING ) ls that really your plan ? You can read my mind ? And I know that , uh , you 're not an Evo . You came here to save your friends , which is noble . Here 's the thing . They 're happy here . Well , except for your friend , Dearing . Maybe not so much . ( SIGHS ) Remember that game where someone tells you not to think about something , and then that 's all you can do ? Think about it . FATHER MAURICIO : He loved you . Had high hopes for you . DIRECTOR : Everybody 's got one thing , Carlos . CARLOS : And I disappointed him . That 's it , one thing that defines you . MAN : You saved us , Bennet . You saved me . Tell me , Carlos , what is it ? Come on , Carlos . ( INDISTINCT VOICES ) What is that ? Come on . Come on , Miro , digame , eh ' ? ( YELLS ) What 's happening ? Get out of my head ! What are you doing to me ? Carlos . You 're hiding a shameful secret , Carlos . You 're living a lie , eh ? Interesting . All right , let 's see where this goes . ( DISTANT GUNFIRE ) ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) ( GUNFIRE INTENSIFIES ) ( GUNFIRE ) ( GROANS ) ( MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ) ( SCREAMING ) ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) ( GASPING ) ( MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ) Go , go , go !

I see you 've met my sister , Phoebe . Drop your gun . The hell are you doing ? What I 've always been doing . Working with Renautas to save the world . You 're the butterfly .

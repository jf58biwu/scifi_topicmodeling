When you deliver the boy . This is not what we agreed . This was about helping my mother . This was your mother 's idea . Sorry . She 's still here ... There you are .

You can 't turn the volume like that . Someone 's gonna call the office . I need you to help me and think . I 'm sorry . But we can 't make so much noise . There could be an amber alert out on us .

I 'm not asking you to pick . You can have us both , me and Sabine . She 's a lovely girl . Promise me you 'll give Tess a choice . Everything 's always a choice . Would you pour the tea , Adul ? You 're with them ? No . Don 't lie , Adul . Tess . Tess . We 're going to have this conversation . One way or another . This doesn 't have to be scary . What do you want ? To help your son grow . You took him from me . A mistake . We 've learned . Mom . The adults are talking . You 'll never outrun us . We 're an invisible army . We 're everywhere . Mom , she said no . Sit in your chair . This isn 't multiple choice . You will say yes . Or we will take the boy from you . Leave her alone . Be quiet . I know what 's best . She 's not you . You are a very bad boy . I don 't care . What have you done ? You 're not gonna take her son . No . No more . Don 't make this difficult . I 'm sorry , mama , But no more . I just want the chance . To explain . Come on . It 's like Kumiko told you . We 're an invisible army . You can never outrun us . No . No ! Mama , wake up . I just had this fixed . This is about you , isn 't it ? Are you doing this ? Well , I guess we better get it right . Come on , stand up . Your mother will be here in a minute . You can 't disappear on me like that . We stay together no matter what . I 'm sorry . Get out of here . I was wrong . They have your sister . They 're holding her , In her dreams . I tried to wake her up , But she wouldn 't wake up . How can they do that ? They can do whatever they want . They ... They gave me this . And I 'm supposed to press it when I 'm near your son . They said they 'd give your sister back to me . What do we do now ? I know someone . A man who might be able to help . You trust him ? Not particularly . Call him . You 're a mess . Don 't worry , we 'll get you help . Who are you ? So ... This is you . I guess you didn 't choose to be you , but ... Here you are . God help us all . All right , let 's go . Where ? Topeka . He 'll be safer in Topeka . Get him up . Give me the contract . If you give me a minute to check the contract , I 'll take you through the terms . Contracts ? I don 't get involved in anything without . A legally-binding contract . See what you can do for Burton . Let me guess . It was two white kids . She didn 't mean it . They never do . Still playing all sides against the middle . What people don 't know , They don 't need to know . Come . Have a seat . Terms are relatively straight-forward , A personal services contract essentially . You and your son will receive housing , allowance , Full-time security , and in return , You will reside in a location of my choosing . Minimum standard of comfort , of course . We were thinking ... Geneva to start ? Geneva or Lucerne . A choice for you already . Primary stipulation laid out in section three . Is that you will give up all freedom of movement . You and your son will be chipped , You 'll be monitored , And you will have no communication . With anyone that has not been approved . Why not just put us in prison ? Prison is for criminals . This is for your own safety . In the wrong hands , your son 's power . Is a danger to us all . What happens if we change our mind ? Like I said , the contract is binding . It 'll be a perfectly fine life . Better than most . Just not free . Read it over . You should sign . Well , there 's one good reason not to . Okay , you can be as angry as you want with me , Just don 't let it make you foolish with yourself . Until he grows up , he 's always gonna have people after him . I don 't even know who his father is . Don 't answer it . I thought I said to hold all my calls . I just want to explain . How did he get this number ? Get the boy out of here . Let 's go , let 's go . This way . Don 't look . They were bad men . They would have hurt you in the long run . Leave us alone . You have to believe me . If you just listen . No ! Looks like the gang 's all here . I just want the chance to explain . Do I have your attention now ? You stay away from my son . I was going to give him back to you . Before this one and that one . Wrecked my timing , I had it all set . You were going to find him . And I was going to be there . And I was going to be the one who helped you . And you would know that all of your pain . And suffering were worth it . Because you would know . That you were a good mother . And you 'd have your device . That 's ... that 's money . For Chrissake , they were auctioning him off . To a bunch of businessmen who think they run the world . I saved him . For you . Press the button . No . No . Call them . No . Put that away . They 'll never get in . They 'll never breach the walls . The device will hold . Look at me . You don 't need to be afraid . It 's all gonna be okay . Because I will never give up . So we 're gonna go back to the beginning , And we 're gonna try again . And we 're gonna keep trying until you and I are safe . And together . You understand ? As long as it takes . Forever if we have to . Are you okay ? What did they do to you ? I don 't remember . What are you doing ? The wisest man in the world . And the wisest woman in the world . Ran off together . And the sun rose . And the sun set .

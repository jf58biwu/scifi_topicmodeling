It 's a rabbit gun , you need to hit head or heart to kill so I need you to control your breathing and lightly ... - squeeze , not pull , I know .

Hi there , how are you ? - Damn it ! Fuck ! Jason , what happened ? - No , don 't touch me ! Just get everything in the car . - What happened ? - Just get in the fucking car ! Her fever break ? - No . Jason , what happened ? - There were a few boxes of food . - But they were there . - Yeah . They were there . - But you 've avoided them before . Why did they attack this time ? I don 't know . I don 't . There was enough food to eat there , there was enough bodies . I thought they would 've moved on . Everything was fine until I cut myself breaking into that house . The blood started flowing and screams grew and they swarmed . It was like they knew . They knew I was bleeding . They could sense it . - What are they ? - I don 't know . But some part of them is human . - Why is that ? - Because they can die . - Come on , come on . Come on . Come on . Please . Please , please . Chris . - Is he infected ? - No . - Show me . - Your name ? - Olivia . You 'll help him ? I can do that . - Press here . He 'll be okay . Grab an arm . You coming from the south ? You and your father ... - stepdad . Well , sort of . Chris and my mom were , you know , together , but they never married . They planned it for September , but ... - You can sleep in the car if you want . - No , it 's fine . I want to sleep near him . We 'll leave , when he 's better , I mean . We 'll leave you alone . Why do you have two campsites ? - In case I lose one or the other . - Oh . - Helps cover your scent , throws them off . You headed north ? - Yeah . - You wanna hear it ? - That 's what 's up north ? - Mm-hmm . - Do you know what they 're saying ? - No . - So that 's it . - That 's all there is . - Chris ? - It 's alright , Liv . It 's okay . - She says you 're heading north . - Yeah , trying to at least . We hear it 's in check up there . Who the fuck knows , right ? You have a pretty nice setup here . Most people would kill for this stuff . You gotta tent . Food , from what I can tell . Car . You gotta full tank ? - No . Just a place to hide from the rain . - Ugh . Thank you . For what you did , for both of us . Not a lot of people would do that nowadays . We 'll be gone in the morning . - Okay . - Get up , kiddo , let 's go . Let 's get in the tent . - Come on , get in ! - So , how long you been out here ? - Since it started . - Hmm . Why you all the way out here in the middle of nowhere ? - My husband grew up in these woods . He lived in a town a mile or two west . He brought us out here . It 's where he felt safest . - Is that who taught you how to be woods woman-y ? - He taught me what he could . - What ? - Come on , Liv . We kept hearing things , you know . How Philly went down in a day but some backwater , berg like bethel didn 't get hit for a month . So Suzanne , Liv 's mom , she said , " let 's wait . " Let 's just fucking wait . She even thought that the red cross was handing out the cure in bottles over in trout run . Turns out they were just handing out hot chocolate and cheese sandwiches . And then Suzy got some sores on her belly , they just looked like little circles . You know ? Little flea bites . And then they started getting worse . Started bleeding and giving off some sort of white puss . Two days later , she , she attacked Liv . She tried to rip her apart with her bare hands . So that 's when I tied her to the bed . And all she did was scream . We left her there for a few days . Just listening to her scream . - You just left her ? Tied to the bed ? - In a way , yeah . I took a kitchen knife and , shoved it in her ear . And I kept on pushing and pushing . Until the screams stopped . I like to think that she forgave me , though . That she heard me say I 'm sorry and believed it . - Oh , my god , oh my god , no ! - Come on , you 're going in ! Here we go ! Bath time . What , I didn 't even throw you in . - Oh my god . - These waters aren 't even that cold . - Oh man . - See , it 's nice . - It looks awful . - I don 't trust you behind me , get out of here . - Well , I can push you . God , are there even any fish here ? - Law of the lake , Liv . Where there are fishermen , there are no fish . - Yeah , but we 're on a river . - Rules still apply . I went on this fishing trip once with Matt theil . You remember Matt , Liv ? Guy was built like a fucking tank . He could open bottles of beer with his teeth . Use to play call of duty 24 / 7 . Anyway , Matt rented a boat one time , well , it wasn 't really a boat , it was more of a skiff . Tiny one at that , couldn 't even fit a case of fucking natty light in it . - Stop . - What ? - Just stop . - Okay . Hey , why did you stop me earlier at the river ? - You know sometimes you , it feels like you forget what 's out there . I don 't know , one minute you 're telling me about how you killed your wife . And the next , it 's just like , we 're on a weekend camping trip . We 'll all return to normalcy on Monday . You know those rings your wife had ? We saw them before anyone knew what was going on . We get patients in the er oozing puss and blood . The rings just devouring the skin around it . Feeding on it like it knew what it was gonna become . The only thing keeping them down there is the fact that they haven 't eaten all the bodies yet . You know , all those people like your wife , just left and tied to the bed . I can 't . I can 't just choose to forget that . - I didn 't forget . I just choose what to remember and when to remember it . Get some sleep , alright ? - They took two houses before I found the last amount . - Hailey needs something to bring her fever down . And we need food . You can 't just quit . You brought us out here for a reason , Jason . This was your call . And we survived . We 've gotten by . - Getting by isn 't life . - Getting by is all we have left . You need to go . - Yeah . Will this mud work ? - I don 't know . Should mask the scent . - Right . - Gosh . I 'm sorry . - Hey , hey . We 're not just getting by . We have more left than you think . - Okay . - You seen her ? - Nah-uh . When are we leaving ? - Soon . - You always say we have to keep moving . Those who stay , die . - We 'll keep going , just not yet . - So what , we 're staying because of her ? - No , we 're staying because she has access to food and water . We should be thankful , Liv . - Why does it matter if we 're leaving anyway ? - Well , it does matter . She deserves it . Lord knows what she 's been through . - Yeah but we 've been through ... - we 'll , we 've all been through shit , Liv . But at least you and I had each other . She didn 't have anybody . Shit . - Here . - I 'm fine , I 'm fine . - Let me see . - No , it 's fine . - Let me see . Why do you still wear it ? - Habit , I guess . - I use to love that show . - My daughter loved the colorful ones . What happened to them ? Your family , I mean . - Same thing that happened to everyone elses . - You 're rationing . - Yeah . Can 't always find food on the road . - You 're leaving , then . - Yeah , soon . - You can take more if ... - nah , nah , please . The more food we take , the more you have to go down there and get some . Hey , why don 't you come with us ? Why not ? - How do you know if what 's out there is any better than what 's here ? - I guess we don 't really . But , I mean , this place can only be paradise for so long . - It 's not a paradise . You 've got Liv so you need to find a place to survive . For you , it 's north . For me , it 's here . - Hey , what would you give me if I hit that tree right there ? What are you , like five ? - I am 12 , thank you very much . Seriously , what are you gonna give me ? That tree right there . - Um . I 'll cook you dinner . - Dinner , really ? You cook us dinner every night . Plus that tree 's 50 yards away . - 50 yards ? - Uh 30 , tops . - Alright , fine . Still , what are you gonna give me ? - Fine . We won 't ration . - My god , you have to . You have to ! - So from here , is this okay ? - Yeah and you have to make precisely that , you see that little hole at the bottom there ? - The one right in the middle . - Yeah . That . - Alright . What are you gonna give me ? - The dinner thing . - You can 't have that thing , that 's Ann 's thing . - Yeah but we get to eat more than four fucking crackers . - Alright , fine then , but what are you gonna give me ? Come on . - We can swim . - Really ? - Yeah . - You hate swimming . - You hate swimming ? - Just in lakes . I don 't like not seeing the bottom . - Alright . This right here , it 's for all the marbles . - Okay , come one . - Big ol ' dinner and swim time . Alright ? Here we go . Oh wait , no , no , I slipped . - Oh , nope , nope . That was a false start . Give me one more shot , I get a second shot . Come on , now . - Oh my god , something just touched my foot . Did it again . - What ? - Nothing . - It 's not nothing . - It 's nothing . Yeah , it 's nothing . Oops , sorry . See you later . Mmm . Never thought I 'd miss this shit . Oh , you want me to make you one ? I 'm really good . Let me try . There we go . Little beet . Little olive . There you go . It 's good , right ? Need more cheese , though ? Here . Come on . Want some cheese , Liv ? - She looks like mom . I mean , not the hair but . She 's good at this stuff , you know ? I mean , if it was me , I would just be like , ah ! Is that why you want her to come with us ? I mean , ' cause she 's good at this kind of thing ? - Now , where would we be if she didn 't find us that day ? I 'd be dead and you 'd be alone . Nobody deserves that . Not you , not her . I want her to come because of you . Because she takes good care of us . Because I wanna take care of her , too . - Can I try that on ? - Sure . - How did he ask you ? - Well . I found out I was pregnant on a Friday . It was late and I told him . And he just looked at me and he left . At midnight , he came back , smelling like liquor and he just sat down at the edge of the bed and showed me a ring . He didn 't asked me , but I said yes . And then we went to bed . I think it came from a pawnshop . Part of me didn 't care . Somehow I knew that was the only way it would happen . - Chris took my mom to Maui . He asked her on the beach during a sunset . She said it was the best day of her life . It 's nice . - It is . Sorta weird to think it was someone else 's before it was yours . - Yes . Okay . I 'll be back . Mama loves you , okay ? Alright , you know that ? You know how much I love you ? Bye , baby girl . Bye , sweetness . Okay . Shh , mama 's here . I 'm so sorry I left you . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . - Y 'know , I don 't know anything about you other than the fact that you 'restubborn . - I 'm not stubborn . - Aha ! Only stubborn people instantly deny being stubborn . - It 's called entrapment . - Maybe . But now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you , Ann , whatever the hell your last name is , is stubborn . - You 're good at that . - What exactly ? - Making me forget why I 'm here . Goodnight , Chris . - Goodnight . Come with us . - We 've talked about this . - Things can change . Annabelle rose Marshall . Organ donor . Good for you . - Stay . Stay right here . Stay . - No . We can 't . Those that stay put , die here . - Well , I 'm alive . - Yeah , but look what happened to your family . Ann , I didn 't mean it . Ann , I 'm so sorry , I didn 't ... - she must 've taken some . I mean , there was at least a box of crackers ... - Oh fuck ! Olivia ! - Chris ! Chris , wait ! - Olivia ! - Liv , where are you ? Olivia ! - Did you get any in your mouth ? Liv ? - No . - You ? - No , I don 't think so . - You would 've tasted it . - That thing that came up here . - They didn 't . Food must be scarce . - You still wanna stay . We 're leaving in the morning . - How are you , pretty girl ? What do you see ? What do you see ? Yes , you like being with your mama ? Yes , yes , here we go . Oh , Hailey . Come here , my love . Here we go , here we go . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . Chris . Chris , stop . - Why won 't you come with us ? - Because , I 'm , I 'm not ready . - You 're gonna fucking die here ! - Well , maybe I deserve to fucking die here . - Oh , so that 's what this is . This is some sorta punishment . Fucking atone for whatever it is you did and move on , already . - This isn 't a world where you can just forgive and move on . We use to be able to fuck up and then say you 're sorry and feel better until the next time you fuck up . With my daughter , there was no next time . So who can I apologize to ? Huh , Chris ? There 's no one here . - Yeah well , my wife , she isn 't here either . I fucking killed her in front of her daughter . And it doesn 't matter if she was one of them or not , I confronted it . And I don 't blame me , I don 't blame her , I blame them . The only world that won 't right itself , Ann , is your own . And the reason for that is because of you . Not because of what happened here or what 's north , you . Look , your family , they aren 't here anymore , but you are . So please , just tell yourself you 're sorry , accept it and move the fuck on , already . - We 're gonna need more food . And I won 't be able to get it by myself . - You just tell me what to do . - I 'm coming , too . - Liv , no your not . - I 'm coming ! I 'm just the same as Ann or anyone else , I can help . Three carrying food is better than two . - Fine . - Chris will distract them . All you and I will do is fill our packs with everything you can . Just food , nothing else . And then we run . First sign of them , you run , don 't worry about me . Okay , Liv ? Liv , you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - Okay . Hey . Look , we 're all gonna be fine . Chris , Chris is gonna be fine . - I know . I know he 's gonna be fine . That 's us . Let 's go . Grab any food you can find . Liv , we gotta be quick ! Just grab any food you can . Olivia , what the hell ? We gotta go . What are you ... We have to , we have to ... We have to ... - Thought it would bleed more . - No ! Don 't ! - Liv ! What 's wrong ? - They 're after me , - where 's Ann ? No , they 're not . I lost them . Where 's Ann ? - She ... - where 's Ann ? - She 's ... - Oh fuck ! Get in the car . - Chris , I ... - Get in the fucking car ! - Olivia ! - Okay .

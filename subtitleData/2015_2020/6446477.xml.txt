 Where is she ? Where is she ? ! - Where is she ? - I don 't know . - Where is she ? - I don 't know . I have something you want . Left pocket . I beg you , don 't kill me . Brother Jerome . Brother Carson . I told Michael you wanted to join the harvest . I hope I didn 't overstep . Michael always says to each his own path . When you 're done here , come join us in the orchard . Thank you . Alan ? Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! Alan ? Alan . Wait . Wait . Wait . What are you looking for ? A shovel . For what ? To dig up Alan Farragut 's grave . - He left something for me . - Like what ? Only one way to find out . The dead should rest . He 's rested enough . It 's time for him to get back to work . Thanks for so many of you coming to counsel today . I know sometimes I get so wrapped up in my work I forget the promises that I made to each of you when you arrived . The promise that I would be nothing for myself everything for each of you and more time for us . It 's very hard , what we do here . We 've left a world where all we ever did was give in to other people 's demands their ideas for who we are . A world where we measured ourselves by other people 's approval . It 's not easy leaving all of that behind . We surrendered ourselves to a simple life and by the loss of the self , we became truly individuals . And we are free , to simply be . Say it with me , Rob . - I am . - I am . - You 're what ? - Nothing . - I just am . - That 's right . You surrender , and you just are . Thanks , Rob . Mother ? Mother ? Where are you , Mother ? - Where are you ? - Soren . Soren . Get him off . Soren , stop ! - Stop , Soren . Soren . Get him off . - Let me go ! Let me go ! Somebody help her . Let me go . He 's all right . Just don 't move . Peter , the pathogen is here . - It 's in the Abbey . - What ? Who ? A child . A boy . He was exhibiting all the symptoms we saw on the boat . - He should be in quarantine . - We gotta lock this place down . You 're all here . Good . Good . Sit . Sit , please . Dr. Jordan , I wasn 't expecting to see you this morning . She disobeyed your orders . The punishment is expulsion . I 'm aware of the policy regarding skeptics , Anne . But she kept Olivia 's injuries from getting a lot worse . As I 've told our guests , we don 't tolerate intrusion from the outside . And ordinarily , I would agree . But I think we all know that there is something amiss here . The boy , Soren , he 's very sick , isn 't he ? Yes , he is . And he 's not the only one . I saw a man this morning infected , same symptoms . - An adult male , late 20s . - Brother Isaac . - You knew ? - Dr . Jordan , I 'm sorry but we live on an island that 's 400 miles from the nearest fast food joint . We 've got no convenience stores , no anti-depressants , no World Wide Web . We 're completely self-sufficient and we take care of our own which is why I 'm not very good at asking for help . But I 'm doing that now . Dr. Farragut , if we give you our cooperation is there any way you think you can find this disease ? - Get rid of it ? - We 're not equipped for containment . We expected to observe and take samples . What if you had the right equipment ? Coast Guard won 't be back for two weeks . Unless you have a helicopter hidden somewhere ... . No , we don 't , but we do have a pretty well-equipped botany lab . The equipment is not exactly current , but it 'd be at your disposal . We 'll need a lab as well as a quarantine for any infected patients . Anne , see that our friends get everything they need . Of course . Our biggest concern now is containment . So we need to find this Brother Isaac immediately . If this illness gets off this island , we could be facing a pandemic . We 'll set up search teams . Whatever you need . Please help us figure out a way to stop this . Oh , hold it . I hit something . You find what you were looking for ? No . Why not ? Because this isn 't Alan Farragut . Gently . Gently . It 's okay , Soren . Gently . It 's okay , Soren . It 's okay . It 's okay . We 're gonna help you . The last person to see Isaac said he was headed to the basement . Everybody , stay on your toes . We 're going in circles . Let 's split up . - Cover twice as much ground that way . - Twice as likely to get lost . Your call , boss . You , you , with me . Sir . Stay sharp . He could be anywhere . Leave ! Get the hell out of here ! I 'll kill you ! The hell did he go ? - You find Isaac ? - More like he found us . He- - He got away . He could be anywhere by now . This place is riddled with underground tunnels . Haven 't seen a monocular microscope in a while . - Like ever . - You 've been out of the field way too long . What 's with all this equipment ? Why does a cult need a botany lab ? Part of Michael 's grand design ? Let 's just focus on what we know . You have the samples from the infected boy ? Blood , urine and buccal swabs . And skin lesions too in the event we can find a biopsy kit . How long until you can analyze them ? Back in Seattle , two hours . - Here ? At least 20 . - Okay . I ... . I 've been trying to think of a way to tell you this where you wouldn 't freak out but Alan 's here . - Alan 's where ? - He 's on the island . - He 's dressed up like one of the followers . - That 's ridiculous . Look , I saw him this morning outside my window . And then I saw him again ... . I saw him again when Soren attacked his mother . - That makes no sense . - I don 't know , maybe it has to do with Ilaria . Why would Ilaria be interested in some crackpot , isolationist cult ? Why would my brother be investigating ? - Be surprised if he 's here for the food . - This isn 't a joke . He has been discredited by the CDC . And don 't forget about the international arrest warrants . Whatever he is doing here , we are to have no contact with him . - But it 's Alan . Peter , he can help . - No contact , Sarah . Everything okay , doctors ? Yeah . Just a procedural question . Let 's get back to work . Nothing to worry about . Soon as they get what they 've come for , they 'll leave . But others will follow . We should expel them now . Nothing to find , so nothing to fear . - Is there ? - It 's the disruption they cause . All these women , my grandmother , her mother and her mother before her . All the way back to the beginning . We all knew what we had to protect . They 've entrusted me with their legacy . I can 't let them down . Sweet Anne . Well always looking at the big picture . But the boy , Soren and Isaac they 're both very sick . All the more reason to find Isaac and cooperate with the doctors . Right ? Isaac ? - Hi , brother . - Hello . - Afternoon , brother . - Good day , brother . Jerome . Michael asked if you 'll join him . - After the picking ? - He wants to see you now . - I don 't understand it . This isn 't him ? - Not all of him anyway . The bones are from more than one person . The skull is from a woman . A lot of people died on this island years ago . - It 'd be easy to mix them up . - Yeah , not Alan . He never did anything without a purpose . Dead or alive , there 's a clue here . That 's weird . You see the ilium ? The hip bone . What about it ? Most people have two fused together . This guy 's got three . Does this mean anything to you ? Afraid not . I ... . I gotta go . - Where are you going ? - To check my traps . Jerome . Glad you could come by . Would you like a cup of tea ? - No . Thank you . - Purple Oolong . Created it myself right here . Grafted a Mount Kenya varietal with a Chinese leaf . Goes down easy . You 're a geneticist ? I 'm an observer of intertwining fates . At any of the seven taxonomic ranks plants create new forms , hence the massive number of species . And you 're just helping create a few new ones ? - Nothing that wouldn 't occur naturally . - Only at random . Random . Yes . " What a book a devil 's chaplain might write on the clumsy , wasteful , blundering , and horribly cruel work . " Charles Darwin said that . He didn 't much care for slow or random . Spoken like a man who knew him personally . Nothing is random , Jerome . Every path is created , sometimes by outside forces . But there is not a random atom to be found anywhere in the known universe . So everything has a purpose . No , Jerome . Everything has a reason . You 've been here for three months . Time to answer the fundamental question . Why did you come here ? To find my true path . - So you randomly chose my order . - There 's more to it than that . I 've done terrible things . Taken lives . My choices for self-discovery were limited . - So you 're hiding ? - Aren 't all of us hiding here ? Even you ? No . We 're not hiding here . We confront our past to put it behind us . We embrace our faults to learn to love them . We face our pain to be released from it . And when you start facing your pain , Jerome only then will your healing begin . What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm isolating the pathogen . - Without your safety gear ? Look , I can work twice as fast without my gear on . What if Kyle walks in here and sees you working on a BSL-3 hot agent like that ? Everyone who gets this disease dies . It won 't affect me . We need to be using every advantage we can . And how do we explain it ? I am telling you- - You don 't have the right to tell me what I can do . I 'm the only one who has the right . You 've been fighting that since they made me team leader . I know you think it should be you . - No , I don 't wanna be team leader . - Why do you oppose every order I give ? Am I not allowed to think for myself ? Alan welcomed people 's input . - Alan is not in charge here . - Obviously . I decide who we talk to , who we trust , who we confide in . If you have a problem , let me know . If we have to , we will work without you . - Come quick . - What 's wrong ? Better see for yourself . Hey , Soren . How you feeling ? Good , I guess . Where 's my mom ? His vitals are normal , he 's coherent , his symptoms are clearing up . - Six hours ago , he was having a seizure . - No memory of it whatsoever . Let me talk to him . - Hey , Soren . - Hi . You really scared us . I did ? Yeah . Do you remember anything about this morning ? No , not really . I had a really bad headache though . Yeah . Looks like this guy had a really bad headache too . You wanna talk about his headache ? He 's just a toy . He doesn 't get headaches . And anyway , he wouldn 't remember either . Maybe some form of anterograde amnesia ? We won 't know what it is until we can build a full clinical profile of whatever the hell this is . - Any luck finding Isaac ? - No , and we 're quite concerned . Brother Landry thinks he may have gone outside the gate . Thought you said that was dangerous . What with the wolves and such . We take his disappearance very seriously . - Soon as we find him , we 'll let you know . - We can get started without Isaac . We have to establish a connection between him and Soren . Were they eating together ? Drinking from the same water ? Where were when they were each exposed ? Dr. Jordan . Sarah . It 's just a nosebleed . I 'm fine . Okay . We 'll keep Soren here under observation . Just because he 's asymptomatic doesn 't mean he 's cured . Sister , is it possible to retrace Isaac and Soren 's steps over the last few days ? Find a point of intersection ? We follow a daily schedule of work and counseling . Even the children are expected to comply . Okay . I 'll talk to Olivia , you two map the infected patients ' movements . Whatever this is , it 's hot and it 's on the move . So this is where Isaac worked ? Yes . Do the children ever come down here ? No . Your trees . They look like Cortlands or Paula Reds . You know your apple cultivars . - How many children live here ? - Nearly 30 , including the babies . Classes are held every day after council hall . - They all sleep in the same place ? - And eat together as well . Do they get Mom and Dad time ? Until they 're 7 . After that , we 're all Moms and Dads . So the kids choose elders to help them find their path . A little young to be making those kind of decisions , no ? You have a closed mind for a scientist . When can I talk to Soren ? Is he gonna be okay ? You 'll be with him soon . Did Soren do anything different in the last few days ? Anything out of his routine ? I don 't see Soren for most of the day . He 's either with the other children or receiving counseling . - Counseling ? - Instructions from their minders . We don 't have punishments here . We help each other to realize our individual wants and needs . - You get a lot of new arrivals ? - Some . But most people have been here for generations . - And what about you ? - Island born and bred . Our apples are designed to withstand the abuses of man and nature . - Insects , disease , poor weather and soil- - - Designed ? Like GMOs ? Oh , nothing so fancy . We follow the old ways . You 're grafting . Combining different traits from different strains of fruit . Do you know a man named Isaac ? I know him , yes . You ever consider leaving ? Why would I do that ? See the world , meet new people . What can you people offer me that I can 't get right here ? You never know until you give it a try . Do you mind if I take a few bark and soil samples ? I don 't see how that could hurt . Both he and your son fell ill at the same time . Could he have passed the illness on to Soren ? Or vice versa ? Children are never alone with the adults . The children are never alone . Come . I wanna show you something . What ... ? What 'd you wanna show me ? What do you wanna see ? Or maybe you can show me ? Show you what ? What you people have . What my family on the island doesn 't . Whoa , whoa , whoa , now . Show me . Show me . Be my path . Be my path . Stop it . Stop . I have to get back to my work . Do you have any other questions ? Nope . Can I speak to one of your pickers ? If you must , but be brief . Excuse me . I 'm Dr. Sarah Jordan . Can I speak with you , Brother ... ? Jerome . Of course . I just wanted to thank you for your help earlier with the boy . Most people would 've been too scared . I don 't want to see him hurt or see him hurt anyone . There 's enough violence in the world . We can agree to that . Sister , may we have a word ? - You need to get out of here now . Today . - Alan , what are you doing here ? Get Peter and the other guy ... - ... and get the hell out . - I can 't . The Coast Guard won 't be back for two weeks . Then go down to the dock and wait , and pray you make it off this island alive . Why ? What 's going on ? - Alan , tell me what 's going on . - Is everything all right ? I 'd like to get back to work . What do these carvings mean ? They don 't mean anything . Then why 'd you run out of here as soon as you saw them ? You say you want to stop an outbreak . How do I know you 're telling the truth ? You don 't . Then why should I believe you ? Because I don 't have time to lie . It 's getting worse . - How long do you have ? - I don 't know . Days maybe . Then why bother ? Because the other choice is doing nothing , and that 's unacceptable . It 's a map of the island . What 's this right here ? A place you don 't want to go . - And neither do I. - I have to go . Then you 're not coming back . Why not ? What 's there ? Why would he give that sign if he didn 't think we were in danger ? I don 't know . Why does Alan do anything ? Maybe he wants us to regroup , wait for the Coast Guard . Maybe we 're standing in his way of killing someone else . He 's telling us to run . I don 't care what he 's telling us . We 're the CDC . We don 't run . That sounds like something Alan would say . Come on . Dr. Sommer 's due to meet us in the lab . So this is what I 've been able to piece together . Everyone 's tightly scheduled here . Work , eat , sleep , plus a healthy helping of New Age philosophy . No one goes anywhere randomly . Doesn 't look like Isaac and the kid were around each other at all . So how are they the only two who got sick ? Maybe compromised immune systems ? No , Soren 's T-cell count was off the chart . The kid 's healthy . What are we talking about here ? Twenty-seven victims on that boat , only two on the island . One missing , one asymptomatic but possibly contagious as hell . Doesn 't make sense . Olivia got pretty rattled when I brought up Isaac . Swore Soren had never been with him alone . - You think she 's lying ? - Someone is . We need to find out who . - How much farther ? - You won 't get there till tomorrow . - Tomorrow ? - This terrain isn 't the friendliest . Pretty easy to get lost . You could always come with me . I 'll take you as far as the river . Then you 're on your own . My God . This was a child . Predation marks on the bones . Animals must 've gotten to him . Or something worse . - You can 't be in here . - I have to talk to you . Sarah . - It 's after curfew . If anyone catches you- - - Alan , the pathogen 's on the island . - That boy this morning , he was infected . - That 's why I 'm here . You have to go . Did you know that 27 people were killed on a ship 12 miles out ? - They got off the island . - Yeah . We don 't know how it spread or how to stop it . You can help figure this out . I 've started collecting samples . - No , I can 't help you . - Why not ? Alan , what the hell happened to you ? You disappeared , you quit the CDC . There 's rumors about bombings in Paris . I can 't explain it right now . I thought you were dead . I had no idea what happened to you . I find you and you won 't tell me anything . Sarah , I can 't . It 's too dangerous for you and for the team . You have to trust me . This island is not what it seems . - You have to take the others and go . - You owe me an explanation . And you owe our baby . Our what ? Are you saying we have a child ? No , Alan . There 's no child . I 'm so sorry . There 's no child because I 'm still pregnant . I 've been pregnant for the last 15 months . I don 't understand . How ? I was already pregnant when I received Julia 's spinal fluid . I became immortal and stopped aging , and so did the fetus . Jesus . I thought my pregnant girlfriends were exaggerating about the first trimester . But after 15 months of fatigue and morning sickness and nosebleeds ... . You know , I thought about terminating and I probably should have but something always stopped me . So here we are . I wanna help . I do , but ... . But I can 't . You have to leave here now . For your safety and the baby 's . No . I 'm not going anywhere until you tell me why you 're here . I can 't . What I have to do is too important . Don 't be afraid , Soren . What 's wrong ? Is my mom okay ? Better than okay . She wants to see you . Really ? But what about curfew ? It 's okay . Just this one time . My mom 's outside the wall ? She 'll be here in a minute . You hear that ? - That was her . - Are you sure ? More than sure . It 's okay . I promise . Landry . Landry , what are you doing ? Hello . No !

 BIG JIM : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons ... rage ... grief ... fear . My God . ( people exclaiming ) Now , in order to survive , we must battle our most dangerous adversary ... the enemy within . BIG JIM : Who are you ? I 'm Christine Price , and this is my friend Eva . Excuse me , I need some air . And you all know each other ? We all have something to contribute . And I 'll set up an office here in this building . If anybody needs support , come find me . What are you doing ? You were snooping . - Please tell me you have the camera . - What 's wrong , is it missing ? Flight calculations of the meteoroid . Therapist , my ass . Christine works for Aktaion . You 're sleeping in the same motel as me , two doors down , but with her . ABBY : Take it . It makes all the pain go away . JUNIOR : It 's safe . I checked the plans . Because I 'm telling you : that column is load-bearing . You take that out , the whole place is gonna come crashing down . I waited up all night to talk to you while you were with her ! ( gasps ) That was amazing . Just everything felt so heightened . It was like ... Being back in the other world ? What is that ? Oxytocin . Our bodies produce it naturally during sex . Only this is about a thousand times stronger . Can I count on you ? I need you to do everything I ask without question . I know how to follow orders . Everything that I do ... that you and I do ... will be for the good of the group . Everything ? ( both chuckle ) - ( dog barks ) - There it is . That 's it . - ( whimpering ) - What ? What 's wrong , boy ? Hey , what 's wrong ? What 's wrong , you got ... you got something in your paw , there ? Never seen you be so friendly to another creature . What 's his name ? I call him Indy . - You like that , don 't you , boy ? - You sure this footage is worth risking our lives for ? That Aktaion guy had a gun to your back last night . Trust me , if what 's on that video doesn 't open your pretty boy 's eyes about Christine , nothing will . Why is Aktaion trying to kill you ? Because I got tired of being their guinea pig . But this is much bigger than that . Somebody 's infected all of Chester 's Mill . The town 's infected ? With what ? Whatever got into Christine when she dug that damn egg up . When I show the town what it is , they 're gonna come to their senses and kick her ass out of Chester 's Mill . Aktaion must have followed me . Do you ever tell the truth ? How do I even know there was a camera in there ? Listen : you came out here to find me , not the other way around . So you can either paddle the hell out of here right now or you can shut up and help me get that camera back . I was hoping that was you . Thank you . So what 'd Julia say , anyway ? To make you punch the door like that ? It doesn 't matter . Get it off your chest . You 'll feel better . Uh ... yeah , she 's making herself ... crazy with conspiracy theories . She-She thinks that you and Christine are lying about who you are . So tell me she 's wrong . Eva . Answer me . I can 't , I ... Why not ? Because I-I can 't . ( scoffs ) Look , I-I can 't be with someone who 's not gonna talk with me . HUNTER : Next . Step up . Come and get it . Joe , Norrie . Bet you guys are hungry . What even is that ? It smells like burning hair . Cattle feed . Tastes better than it smells . I 'd prefer burning hair . Looks like a lot of work . HUNTER : Bunch of us took shifts sorting , soaking , grinding . We were up all night , but it would 've taken a week otherwise . It 's amazing what people can do when they work together . Hey , Norrie , you don 't mind taking over for me , do you ? I need a break . Uh ... I promised Joe I would help him do something this morning . Yeah , yeah , I asked her to give me a hand with some solar panels near my house . Town needs power , right ? Christine asked us to get electricity back up as soon as possible . Well , you can 't argue with Christine . Morning . Morning . How are you ? Aside from this massive headache ... much better . Thanks for doing everything that you did . You want to do everything again later ? ( sighs ) Sneaking out , are you ? Feeling the Town Hall pull . I got to check in . Make sure the place is still standing . Christine 's counting on me to lead the support group . Oh . Back in a few hours ? Yeah . You want to check out that secret stash of booze in the crawl space at Town Hall ? The dome 's energy supply is beginning to fail . When Jim Rennie destroyed the egg , he compromised our power source . One amethyst died this morning and a second one is losing power , which is causing the amniotic fluid in the cavern to dry up . It 's only a matter of time before the dome begins to calcify . If the kinship can 't come together , we will all suffocate . Barbie . Come on in , hon . Have a seat . Who the hell are you ? ( booming crash , breaking glass ) - MAN : Oh , my God ! - MAN 2 : The ceiling 's caved in ! GIRL : Oh , my God ! MAN : We need help ! ( indistinct clamoring ) - Hey , hey , come here , get that end . - ( groans ) All right ... Okay , all right , count of three , we 're gonna lift up . I want you to slide him out , all right ? One , two , three ! ( grunting ) PETE : All right , Dale . Put ' em down . Christine . This is your fault . ( groaning ) - I want to finish this conversation . - We will . We 've got more important things to deal with right now . You 'll need to inspect the ceiling , patch up what you can so we can move people in tonight . PETE : Don 't listen to her . She doesn 't know her ass from her elbow . Me , I 've been a carpenter since high school . All right . So what do you think we should do ? Unless you rip out the rest of the ceiling ... you 're looking at another collapse . Actually , Pete , I need you to clear the dust and debris from all the beds , make sure the space is habitable for move-in tonight . Lady , you lost the right to tell me what to do when you let Junior Rennie take his toy hammer to that column . This is on you ! BARBIE : All right , all right . Hey , hey ... we don 't need to make a scene , all right ? I want that man out of this building . - I got this , Christine . - He 's a menace . I said I 've got this . Hey , man . Look , no hard feelings , all right ? It was just starting to get a little tense there . How about we do this : how about you walk me through what happened with that column and then we can figure out step two together . - All right . - All right . There you go . One more step . ( barks ) Go , go , go ! Move ! Go ! Go ! - Go ! - Go , go ! ( chuckles ) You 're gonna need more than a sling for that one , sucka . ( clicking tongue ) Come here . ( panting ) Okay , Indy ... Indy , stay . ( whines ) Stay . Good boy . Maybe we can survive this Town Hall weirdness . I 'll look after you if you look after me . I plan on doing that anyway . ( laughs softly ) Okay , so ... repeat after me . I ... Joe McAlister ... do solemnly swear to look out for Norrie Calvert-Hill ... ( sighs ) All right . I ... Joe McAlister ... do solemnly swear to look out for Norrie Calvert-Hill to keep the freaks with glazed eyes away ... ( laughs ) : Oh , come on . Fine . Yeah , to keep the freaks with glazed eyes away and to kill her if she ever becomes one of them herself . I 'm not gonna let that happen . Okay ? ( exhales ) Screw you for ruining a perfect day . ( sighs deeply ) I love you . What did you just say ? Nothing . You just said that you love me . No , I didn 't . - Yes , you did . - ( laughs ) â™ª Where have you been ? - What happened ? - I knocked out a column . I didn 't know it was load-bearing . Christine backed me up . What the hell does she know about construction ? I said it was my fault . Look , there 's a lot of hurt people in there . Christine wants you to go in and help out . ( bell tolling ) Eva . Barbie is suspicious . What did you say to him ? I didn 't say anything . Remind me again why we 're lying to everyone . I 'm doing this for your own good ; you 're not ready . For what ? Know what ? Forget it . I 'm tired of lying . I want Dale to know who I am . We had an agreement . Not anymore . ( sighs ) Okay , you 're right . Maybe it is time you know the truth . Let 's meet at the cavern this afternoon when things settle down around here . That 's where the answers are . BARBIE : Look , she 's got her areas of expertise . I 'm telling you , Christine 's pulling the wool over people 's eyes . I know a fobbit when I see one . Fobbit ? I haven 't heard anybody use that term since Afghanistan . - Did you serve ? - Yeah . Marines . - Yeah ? - You ? Yeah . Army . Was , uh , Fifth Group , Special Forces . ( exhales ) Worked my way up from combat engineer to EOD . Got a chance to put my construction skills to use . Explosive Ordinance Disposal . - Brave cat . - Nothing decimates humanity - like a few wires and a cell phone . - Had to be - a tight operation . - Dumb broad like Christine would 've gotten us killed inside a week . ( panting ) ( quietly ) : Oh , thank God . ( beep ) _ No . Alaska ? - _ - What the ... ? Put your hands up and move away from the computer . The other way . You can test my blood . JULIA : I 'm not infected . I don 't have what you 're looking for . Put it down . I said put it down ! Where 's the camera , Doc ? MARSTON : The file was damaged during download . BIG JIM : Prove it . CHRISTINE ( garbled ) : According to the dark flight calculations of the meteoroid - and magnetometer readings ... - That 's Christine . Finding the egg . - Where is it , Mr. Rennie ? - Let me tell you something about being a car salesman , Doc . If you want something ... you got to be willing to trade . Do you want that egg ? You better give us some answers . What would you like to know ? What happened in Alaska ? You know , I trusted the guys on those missions more than I 've ever trusted anyone before . You know , people on the outside , they don 't hold themselves to that same standard , you know ? No kidding . I come home from my third tour , I find my tramp of a wife banging an old buddy of mine . - Oh , man , that 's just brutal . - The crazy part is , in the alternate reality I had her back . Then I wake up in a cocoon , realize she 's still out there banging my friend and I 'm stuck in here . With nothing . I wouldn 't sweat it . You 'll find your place . Not if the queen has anything to say about it . So I 'll back you up . Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah , Christine 's done calling the shots around here . He 's here . Have you been drinking ? I had a nip last night . So what ? ( sighs ) Come here . ( sighs ) Selfish decisions have an effect on the group . If you 'd been on time this morning , people wouldn 't have been standing around - when the ceiling collapsed . - The ceiling didn 't collapse because I stayed in bed an extra hour . You 're the one who told Junior to knock the column down . What happened to the Sam I know , the one that I worked so hard to get back on track ? That wasn 't me . This is me . The town drunk . I won 't let you throw away everything you worked so hard for . You can get me the information we need . I can 't let you leave . That 's not up to you . Don 't you walk away from me . I 'm going back to Abby . She accepts me for the piece of crap I am . 25 years ago , a team went on an archaeological exploration to Alaska , and they discovered fragments of what appeared to be an egg in a meteoric crater . Unbeknownst to the scientists , the shards ... emitted electrical charges when touched . Further tests revealed strong heat signatures and readings . BIG JIM : The Geiger counter 's going berserk . Is it radioactive ? It was a different kind of energy from any we 'd ever encountered . Clean and nonradioactive . Can you imagine what humanity could achieve with an intact egg ? No more coal-fired power plants , no more nuclear facilities , no more pollution . Unfortunately , their excitement was short-lived . The group unknowingly became infected when they touched those shards . Whatever was inside that egg altered their behavior . JULIA : They committed suicide ? MARSTON : When their leader walked off that roof , the assistants followed him . - Why ? - Autopsies revealed bodies teeming with cells ... never found in anyone on Earth . Is that what the people of Chester 's Mill - are infected with ? - We don 't know . BIG JIM : What happens if , um ... ( clears throat ) something happens to the egg here ? Whatever the leader does ... the group will follow . Which is why it is crucial for us to meet the person who first touched the egg . We know who the leader is . She worked for you . She 's the woman who was using that camera . We did hire an anthropologist named Christine Price to find the world 's first - intact egg . - But she never returned the egg to Aktaion , did she ? She and her research partner vanished that day . But now that we know that she 's alive , we 'd love the opportunity to ... help her . There 's a treatment for this ? You 're a liar . It 's in the trial stages . It 's ... too soon to call it a treatment , but if we catch the infection early enough , we believe that we have an opportunity to reverse it . And in the meantime , the other infected people ... are they ... safer without her there to lead them ? I can 't say . And we have no way of knowing exactly what they 'll do this time . We 'll lead you to her . - Drop it ! Put it down ! - ( gun chambers clicking ) Drop it ! Tell them to drop the weapons . Weapons down . We 're all friends here . You will lead the team to Christine Price while Mr. Rennie and I continue our conversation on the whereabouts of the egg . ( scoffs ) The hell I am . ( gun chambers clicking ) Very sorry , Mr. Rennie , but you made a promise to me . Share information with me , and I share information with you . You give me the egg , I 'll show you the way out of the dome , and you will be as free as a bird . ( doorbell rings ) Expecting someone else ? Oh . ( door closes ) I can tell how much you love your daughter . What was her name again ? Uh , Courtney . That 's right . I remember now . I met her in the alternate reality . Yeah . It felt so real . You know , I can still ... feel her in my arms . But in real life , Courtney isn 't healthy , is she ? She 's outside the dome and was born with severe brain damage from your drinking . She 'll never talk , never read . Why did you lie to the group ? I don 't know . I just can 't imagine her the way that she is . What I did to her . So I just imagine something else , you know ? She 's out there with new parents , and they 're helping her and loving her , and ... the doctors are fixing her brain . 'Cause I can 't live if I don 't think that she has a chance , so ... But she doesn 't . She never did ... because you 're her mother . Sometimes it 's a relief to admit who you really are . I didn 't mean to hurt her . I love her . I know . I know you do . ( sniffling ) I know you do . But you destroy everything you love . ( crying ) I 'm speaking plainly to you , Abby , because I know how much you care about Sam . I do . The world will never get to know who your daughter might 've been , but there 's still time to save Sam . Okay . I know that you 'll make the right choice this time . ( sniffles ) ( indistinct chatter ) Thank you . Hey , do me a favor . Go tell those guys there putting those beds together , come in here , help us take the ceiling down . ( scoffs ) Good luck with that . Christine told ' em to get the dorms ready for move-in tonight . Hey , I don 't care what she said . You tell them I said move-in can wait . Yeah . All right . What the hell ? It 's scored . ( indistinct chatter ) That was very wasteful . What ? This stuff ? ( loud mechanical humming ) We 're running out of time . Remember when you told me you thought something was growing inside you ? You were right . There is something growing . The egg put a life force inside you . You are changing , cell by cell , into a better version of yourself , a woman who will bear Barbie 's child . But you have to protect him , Eva . You have to be willing to do whatever it takes . The child you 'll have together will replace me . You 're crazy . ( panting ) ( gasps ) Junior . Let me go ! No ! ( groans ) N .. no ! CHRISTINE : Bring her here . ( crying ) : No . No ! ( Eva panting ) ( sighs ) This fluid is finite and precious . ( groans ) A gift I would only give to someone as important as you . ( groaning ) No ! Better now ? I 'm sorry I questioned you before . It seems so simple now . Who I need to be . And you remember what we talked about ? What you need to do for Barbie ? I 'll do whatever it takes . Good girl . Now go get some rest . Why is that happening ? CHRISTINE : You and me ? We 're the same now . It 's not so easy for everyone . Some people need more help than others . And we can 't give oxytocin to everyone . There 's not enough to go around . We need to guide the resistant . Starting with Joe . I need the two of you to build something very important . Hunter said Joe and Norrie abandoned their work . Send Hunter to find them and bring them to Town Hall . Have them wait there for me . Joe ! Norrie ! - Hey . - Christine wants you back at Town Hall pronto . We 're taking the day , Hunter ! There 's no law against that , is there ? ( scoffs ) I have to come up and get you ? Yeah , come up here and check out the view . ( whispering ) : Are you kidding me ? Just ... ( sighs ) Yeah . So , uh , what do you think ? Look , you can actually see the old paper mill from here . - You guys have to come back . - You 're like ... cattle . - We have to work together . - We live together , we work together . We moo together . If you want to eat cow food and be herded , then that 's your choice , but this is a free country , and I 'm gonna do what I want . Norrie . Moo on . I 'm not going anywhere . - Come on . Come on . - Hey , get away from me ! Please . NORRIE : Stop ! - Get off me ! Stop ! - ( gasps ) Oh ! Hunter ! JOE : Hunter ! Hunter , are you okay ? ! Okay , come on , bring it to me . CHRISTINE : What are you doing ? Ripping all the beams out of the ceiling . There 's no patching this up . So Pete was right . Where is he ? He 's taking a break . I 'm sorry . I should have just handed the reins over to you and moved out of the way . I hope you know that I trust you 100 % . ( overlapping chatter ) So , this collapse . I don 't think it was an accident . I 'm not sure , but several of the beams are scored in different places . They 've been cut . Someone did this deliberately ? - Why ? - To prove he was right . Pete ? We can 't have this man in the group . You know what you need to do . What ? You need to take care of him . His actions killed two people . - Barbie ! - Hunter fell off a roof . We need your help . Let 's go . I return with " repleshinments . " ( clears throat ) Replenishments . ( water dripping ) Abby ! ( water running ) Oh . Hey . Oh . ( crying ) ( sobbing ) Another pig was killed . Well , a piglet , actually , so there 's only enough for a few VIPs . We 'll make it our secret . I have to prioritize , which doesn 't always sit well with the people who think they 're getting the short end of the stick . I underestimated you , Pete . You 're a man who listens to his instincts and does what he has to do to be heard . The problem is , is not everyone respects your initiative . Barbie knows that you cut the beams in the ceiling , that you 're responsible for the deaths - of those two people . - What ? Hey , I had nothing to do with that . Of course you did . And I understand why . But Barbie doesn 't . And he 's going to kill you . I pleaded with him . I told him our group can 't operate like that . But his mind 's made up . I know that you 're not the real threat . Barbie is . Without him around , you 'd have everything you want : women , power , status . He 's the enemy . The only thing holding you back . - So what am I supposed to do ? - You 're an instinctive man , Pete . You do what feels right . ( indistinct chatter ) What are you doing in my office ? It 's not your office anymore . What has gotten into you ? You 're even more brash than usual . Well , if I were to scream , everyone in this building would come and restrain you . Not when I tell everyone you 've been lying to them about being a therapist or whatever you are . And I 'm gonna scream it from the center of town if you don 't get your ass in my car right now . All right . All right , we need to stabilize him . Joe , get his head . Norrie , get his feet . Where the hell 's Sam ? ( gasping ) Hey , buddy . Hey . How you feeling ? - What happened ? - JOE : You fell off - the roof . - All right , Hunter , do me ... do me a favor here , all right ? Can you move your fingers ? That 's a good sign . All right , now your feet . Come on , Hunter , I need you to move your feet now . Barbie , I can 't feel my legs . I can 't feel my legs . Okay , listen , I 'm-I 'm gonna go get Eva , okay ? She dealt with a lot of these injuries in the alternate reality . ( panting ) It 's gonna be okay . Hunter , what happened on the roof ? I asked Norrie to come with me and she sat down . And when I tried to get her up , she pushed me . - Norrie pushed me . - That 's not what happened . She 's right . Hunter grabbed her wrist and she pulled away . I mean , he lost his balance . It was an accident . You 're responsible for this . - There need to be consequences . - No , no . It was an accident , like Joe said . Junior , what 's wrong with you ? ( shuddering breaths ) ( whispering ) : Something 's wrong with these people . - Come on . - Go . - This way . - Okay . - Go . Go ! - Go ! - Come on ! - Come on ! ( grunts ) Move ! ( grunts ) Get out of the way ! Junior ! Junior ! Junior . ( panting ) Help us . No one 's going anywhere until we talk to Christine . Get out . It must be exhausting being the only soldier left in a war that 's already been lost . Get out . Start moving . Nothing 's been lost . You 're on your way to Bird Island , where whatever 's in you that 's making you such a monster will be removed . And if you survive , all of Chester 's Mill will get the same treatment until this town goes back to the way that it was . ( chuckling ) : You actually mean to save humanity ? Oh , that 's just so sweet . - ( handcuffs clicking ) - Unfortunately , it 's much too late for that . ( insects trilling ) BARBIE : Eva ! Hey ! Eva ! Hunter fell off a roof . I think he 's paralyzed . - I 'm gonna need a hand . Come on . - Okay . ( grunts , panting ) ( high-pitched ringing ) ( panting ) ( grunting ) ( shouts ) I 'm the hero now , you hear me ? ! I 'm gonna take your place and your girl ! ( grunting ) ( shouts ) ( grunting ) ( choking , shouting ) ( grunts ) ( groaning ) ( coughing ) You will never have a girl like me . You want to know why ? Because you 're a piece of trash who never learned how to be a man . ( shouts ) ( Eva groaning ) - ( grunting ) - ( shouts ) ( panting ) ( bat clatters ) ( coughing ) I 'm here . I 'm here . Hey . ( panting ) I 'll do anything for you , Dale . ( shuddering breaths ) ( both panting ) And I 'll do anything for you . ( radio static crackling ) MAN : We 're almost there . Hey , hey , hey . Door 's that way . Yes . But the way out of the dome is here . Wait ! Wait ! ( grunting ) Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! What is this ? ! It 's a birdcage . Isn 't it extraordinary ? This island was once filled with ornithologists . This ... is my favorite cage . But I 'm not infected . ( dog whimpering ) Indy ? - ( whimpering ) - What are you doing with my dog ? Hey . Hey . Indy . Hey , hey . It 's okay , boy . Hey . It 's okay , boy . Come here . You weren 't honest with me about the egg , Mr. Rennie . The egg is not on Bird Island . ( whimpering ) Wait ! Wait ! I lied . It 's at Town Hall . Christine 's got it . You 've lost your chance . Martin , take this animal into the next room and slaughter it . No , no ! Wait , wait ! Wait . ( panting ) All right . It 's smashed . I broke it . It 's broken . It 's smashed . Give me my dog back . Come here . Come here , boy . Good boy . Come here . Come here , boy . Oh , good boy . Come here . Good boy . You 're a good boy . Good boy , good boy , good boy . Good boy . - Why am I here ? - Every proper study must have an experiment and a control . Christine Price is the experiment , and you , Mr. Rennie , are the control . ( dramatic music )

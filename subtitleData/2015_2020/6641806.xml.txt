 Bellamy : We were born in space . They told us the ground was uninhabitable , but they were wrong , and we 've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed . Some of us have been broken by it , but most of us are still here , searching for other survivors from the ark , trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness--a home . Our leaders believe that to survive , we need to make peace with the grounders , but peace is a foreign concept here . Jaha : I found it , John . The city of light is real . I can tell you about the city of light , but you won 't understand until you experience it yourself . Clarke : I 'm not going in . Just gonna remind me of what I did to get them here . Yu don sin disha plan in ? Indra : Clarke , she 's being hunted . - By who ? - By everyone . Monty : A tracking beacon from the ark--farm station . - That 's the beacon . - This belongs to us . Indra : The ice nation queen wants Clarke 's power . If her people know she has it , she 'll break the coalition and start a war . Bellamy : It 's been 3 hours . What are they waiting for ? Even with the light , i don 't see anyone . I say we make a run for it . Kane : No . That 's what they want us to do . Indra : The boy is right . They can wait longer than we can . Kane : Ok , bellamy . Get in the turret , and you cover us . Once we get to that Ridge over there , we 'll cover you . Copy that . Run fast . They 're here . Man : Everybody out , or the boy dies . Ugh ! Hey , hey ! Ok ! Ok . We 're coming out . Don 't hurt him . Uh ! Rrgh ! Huh ! All targets secure . Found it . It 's mine . Give it back ! Monty , let it go . Monty ? Mom ? Jaha : I still can 't believe how beautiful it is . It 's perfect . In the city of light , mankind will finally be free of pain and hate and disease . Here , there will be no more suffering . I 'll fill this place , starting with my people . You have my word . I believe in you , thelonious . Together , we will save the human race . Murphy : Earth to jaha . Come in , jaha . Yes , John ? Hate to break up your little zen nap , but we 're here . - Already ? - Yeah . A lot faster with a motor . Ungh ! Easy . I was just trying to help . Murphy : As I recall , the last time you helped , two of my friends blew up . No minefield this time . We go around the dead zone . Jaha : Let 's get a move on , you two . Emori : Right behind you . We head west towards that rise . Murphy : You know , this whole helpful guide act , I 'm not really buying it . Then I guess you 're just gonna have to keep an eye on me . Uh ... Oh ... I knew it . Oh ... Farm station , stand down . Pike ? You have no idea how good it is to see you . - Oh ... - Ha ha ha ! Kane : We didn 't think you made it . Lacroix , Smith , watch our 6 . Everyone else , i said , stand down . Man : Yes , sir . Where 's dad ? Father didn 't make it . How many of you are there ? 63 . The rest are camped in the mountains north of here , grounder killers one and all . - Am I right ? - Ooh rah ! Bellamy : Hate to cut this short . We got to find Clarke . Clarke Griffin ? Yeah . If only all of my earth skills students were as good as her . It 's good to see you , sir . Yeah . You , too . Ok . Move the tree . Help them . I 'll be right back . You ok ? I have to be . Man : Now come on . Push ! Kane : 63 ? Farm station left orbit with 3 times that number . We landed with that number , too . The ice nation can be ruthless . Take pride in the number you saved . Indra , this is Charles pike . He was a teacher on the ark . This is indra . She 's leader of trikru and a trusted ally . I 'll have to take your word for it . Uh ! Uh ! Kane , it 's time to go . Kane : Monty , give them the coordinates to arkadia . We have a settlement 50 miles south of here . Your people will be safe there . You 're my people . Good , because we have reports that put Clarke north of here . We could certainly use your expertise . If she 's in the ice nation , you 're gonna need more than that . We leave no one behind . Lacroix , take the team . Rendezvous with the others . Get them to arkadia . Hannah : I 'm staying with my son . Damn right , you are . Mount up . We 're going back into hell . On your feet . Looks like the great wanheda is human , after all . Huh ! Hngh ... - Waah ! - Uh ! Uh ! Yeah . That 's better . You 're ice nation . Smart move , leaving that guard jacket inside . - Fighter approaching . - Where ? Man : Outside pole 20 . The kill order . We have to get you inside the wall . Here . Nyko . Lincoln , be careful . Lincoln : Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold your fire ! - Aagh ! - Come on . Abby . We 'll take you to her . Nyko , chon dula dison ? Rrgh ! Generally , a follow-up appointment is about checking the old injury , not treating new ones . I was trying to make the most of our time together , doc . Can we talk about this one ? You said i was fine . I understand how much Maya meant to you . What is it you want to talk about , how dead she still is ? Jasper , you 're never gonna move past this unless you face your feelings head on . Your friend Finn , he never did that , and it broke him . I don 't want that happening to you . Your daughter killed him , too . Octavia : Abby , Abby , it 's nyko . Lincoln : He said it was azgeda , the ice nation . - Where ? - We don 't know . Jackson : His pulse is weak , and he 's burning up . Abby : Clotting has stopped the flow , but he 's lost too much blood . I 'll type him . Rh null . What 's wrong ? We 're universal donors . - Here . Take mine . - No . You can 't . Rh null can only take rh null . Well , I don 't understand . Can you save him or not ? - Not here . - Jackson- - wait . What 's he talking about ? I 'm talking about mount weather . The medical facility in that mountain is state-of-the-art . They relied on blood to survive . It 's still all there . Abby : You want me to bring a grounder into mount weather for a transfusion ? They killed thousands of people for that blood , Jackson . We can 't just let him die , Abby . We 're doctors . - I am not just a doctor . - Maybe you should be . Lincoln , you said to me yesterday that even our supply runs were putting us at risk . They were jeopardizing our peace . Yeah . How would you advise me now ? Lincoln- - he 's my friend . Save him . Get him ready for transport . I hope you 're ready to face your feelings . Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! - Oh ! - Rrgh ! Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! Oh ! Yah ! Uhh ... Huh ... Uh ! Yaah ! Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! Agh ... Weron- - bellamy : Are you ok ? You all right ? Bounty hunter . - English . - Pike , go outside . Take monty and Hannah . Search the perimeter . Make sure he was alone . So was he . Please . She 's in danger . You 're skaikru ? Yeah . She was here last night . Did she say where she was going ? No . She was here when I fell asleep and gone when i woke up . She give you any indication of where she might go ? No ... But he did . He said that his partner came back for her . He was ice nation . - I hope you find her . - Thank you . Good news . I found fresh tracks . Great . Start the rover . That 's the bad news- - too many trees . We have to go on foot . Uh ! Quiet . Ice nation scouts . Come on . We backtrack . Then we go around . Aah ! Ooh ! Oh ! Their deaths are on you . Didn 't have to be this way . - Uh ! - Oh ! Uh ! If you were gonna kill me , you would 've done it already . There 's still time . Voice : Arrive level 3 . - How you holding up ? - Don 't worry about me . Just get the blood . I 'll prep him . Don 't do anything stupid . You mean like coming back here ? You haven 't told me what happened to dad . All you father wanted was to find you . He loved you . That 's what matters . Ask you a question ? Last report we got on the ark , you were under attack by grounders . What changed ? Well , it turns out , we had a common enemy . What happened to them ? - We won . - Quiet . Listen . War drums . Azgeda . You can tell it 's ice nation from the sound ? No , from them . Pike : We need to get those bodies off the field unless you 're good with them thinking we did this . Go . Hurry . Bellamy : Wait . Two people at 12 o 'clock . It 's Clarke . - Hey , hey , hey ! Ho ! - Get out of my way . - You 'll never make it in time . - He 's right . Look . No way we get across without being seen . We should lay low , let the army pass . Then we find Clarke . Guys , there 's a cave . We just got lucky . Come on . - I can 't go with you . - Why ? Ice nation has crossed the border . They 're marching against my commander . I have to warn her . - We 'll get Clarke . - You better . The ice queen gets her first , she 'll be dead , and we 'll be at war . Scream again , and we 'll both be dead . Hey ... You really been to the city of light ? Shut up , otan . I 'm not listening to that skrish again . Come . Walk with me . Murphy : Thank god he 's got somebody else to preach to now , huh ? Not a believer ? I believe you 're here for a reason . Just don 't know what it is yet . We were recruited . Recruited by who ? I don 't know her name . She comes to us in the flying machine . You mean the drone . Yeah . That 's how she found us , too . So what do you do for her ? We collect tech . You mean steal it . - When we have to . - Right . We bring it to the island , to him . That 's how we survive . This time , she said they needed a ride . What are you doing ? Don 't try to be a hero , and I 'll leave you on your feet this time . Oh , a hero ? And here , I thought you got me . Come on . Really , are you about to steal from the people you steal for ? Shh . We have other buyers . Now be quiet . Bad idea . Murphy : Ok . Oh , easy , easy . Hey , come on . Hey , big fella , come on . There 's no harm done , all right ? Just put her down . Just put her down , all right ? Yah ! Yah ! There is no pain in the city of light . Uh ! You coming , or what ? Nngh ... Ohh ... Uh ... Nngh ... Another inch , and I 'd be dead . Maybe you 're not the commander of death , after all . Now she 's quiet . Why are you hiding from your own people ? Why 'd you run away from yours ? The great wanheda ... Mountain slayer . I 'm no one . Lot of people out there right now looking for no one . You 're obviously not loyal to the ice nation , so why are you taking me there ? Look . Whatever the ice queen is giving you , my people will offer you more . Doubt that , not for someone who abandoned them . You don 't know anything about me . I know you took the coward 's way out . Like you 're so different ? You 're in disguise , same as me . You 're on the run , same as me , in the wilderness , same as me . I was banished , nothing like you . You had a choice , and , no , I can 't take you home to your people ... Because you 're the way back home to mine . - We 're losing her . - Relax . Save your energy . Kane 's right , son . The army will move soon . You 'll need your strength for what comes next . I need to know what happened . Monty- - please . We landed in the snow . Your father said it absorbed some of the impact . That 's why we survived . The snow looked so beautiful , it- - Hannah : Charles ? The children were playing in it . They were the first to die ... 15 of them . If not for your father , would 've been more . He pulled 4 kids back into the ship , all 4 alive today . They got him when he went back for the fifth . Your father died a hero , monty . We 've been fighting grounders ever since . That was the ice nation . Not all grounders are the same . They are to me . Emori : As soon as otan gets here , we can leave . Partners in crime , huh ? Whatever 's in there , we 'll split it 3 ways . You earned that . Yeah , and all we had to do was kill a guy . Thank you for saving my life . Let me . I could 've done that . Ah , now , that 's tech . Murphy : It 's more than just tech . Stupid son of a bitch brought her with him . Brought who with him ? Took you long enough . You shouldn 't have opened that . We needed to see what we had . Check it out . You 're not wearing your scarf . How 'd you know how to do that ? Give me the backpack , John . Heh . No . - Huh ! - Oh , easy . Ea--come on . Easy . What are you doing ? Otan , let me go . Doesn 't have to be this way , John . What the hell is going on ? Murphy : Otan ate the damn chip . That 's what 's going on . No one else has to die today . Tell me , is your imaginary friend waterproof ? - Should we find out ? - She 's not imaginary . She 's very , very real , and she can help you . All you have to do is say yes . All you have to do is let her go . You 're in a lot of pain , John . I 've been there . Losing my son almost killed me . The city of light unburdened me . It made me whole . I can unburden you , John . You just simply return what 's mine . - I got a better idea . - Stop ! You want me to stop ? You let her go right now , or I 'm gonna drown the bitch in the red dress . - Good . - Otan- - emori , get in the boat . Now give me the pack . It 's all yours , chancellor . Uh ! Start the boat . We 're leaving . Murphy : Bon voyage , jaha . We should go after them . There 's no need . They 'll understand . How can you be so sure ? Because I haven 't told you the best part . You know there 's no pain here . There 's no death in the city of light , either . He 's waking up . Hey ... Thank you , Abby . When can we move him ? Doesn 't look good for us to be here . This place just saved his life . It 's not that simple . Our people , they 'll never see anything but death here . Our people are wrong , Lincoln , and we can change their minds . Places are not evil , brother . People are . Abby , this place , it could do so much good for our people and theirs . We have to find hope somewhere . Ok . Ok what ? Ok . Let 's open it up . Where is it ? Come on ! Uh ! Uh ! Agh ! Yaah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! - Hey- - - I 'm fine . This was her favorite ... Represents the second circle of hell , which is pretty ironic if you think about it . I told her i liked it , but- - I don 't know . I miss her . It 'll get better . Wh--when ? Monty : 42 of us got out alive . We did what we had to . Pike : You did the right thing . Kill or be killed . So mount weather is ours now ? Yeah . Yeah . We use it for supplies . Supplies ? It 's a nuclear-hardened underground city . We established a truce . We need to think about perception . You need to think about what happens when the grounders break that truce , because they will . Oh , crap . Bellamy , what are you doing ? Hmm . Huh ... Bellamy . - I 'll get you out of here . - Look out ! Uh ! Ooh ! Uh ! Clarke : Oh , please . Please don 't . I 'll do anything . I--I 'll stop fighting . Just please don 't kill him . Thank you . - Huh ! - Aagh ! Huh ! Aagh ! Don 't follow us . Ugh ! Ah ... Uh ! Ah ! Huh ... Gaah ! Aagh ! Monty : Bellamy . He 's hurt . Kane : He 's here . We told you to wait for the army to move . What happened ? I--i--i almost got her . I- - pike , find their trail . Its useless . He knows he 's being followed now . - Ah ! - Hey ... You can 't even walk . So , what , we- - we give up , let him kill her ? Rrgh ! God ... Bellamy , I want to find her , too , but look at your leg . You could die out here . We have no trail . We can 't lose Clarke . We- - we can 't lose her . We 'll find her , ok ? We will figure something out , I promise ... But this isn 't the way . Ok . I got you . Come on . Let 's head back . Hello , Clarke . The deal was for you to bring her to me unharmed . She didn 't come easy . I 'd expect not . I 've done my part . Now do yours . Lift my banishment . I 'm told your mother 's army marches on polls . That has nothing to do with me . Honor our deal . I 'll honor our deal when your queen honors my coalition . Lock prince roan of azgeda away . - Yes , heda . - Yes , heda . - What of wanheda ? - Leave us . You heard me . Uh ! I 'm sorry . It had to be this way . Had to ensure one heda didn 't fall into the hands of the ice queen . War is brewing , Clarke . I need you . Uh ! Aah ! You bitch ! Ugh ! You wanted the commander of death ? You 've got her ! Aah ! I 'll kill you ! Aah ! Aah ! No ! Oh ! Aah ! Aah ! Oh ! Aah !

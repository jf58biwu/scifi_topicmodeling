 - Can I count on your support for school trustee ? - I 'm thinking of running against you . - We can 't afford a campaign . - We would like to buy your business . - She 's the midwife . You 're doing very well , and you 're very strong . - You 're not locking Gracie up any more . - Run ! She says they have the same tattoo . A picture of a two-headed horse . It was the only way I could see to get you out of Dyad . - Betray my sister ? ! - For Kira . That 's not your bloody decision ! - What the hell 's going on ? - This is Seth . They wrote down all my information in this little notebook . And then Seth yanked out a piece of my hair and put it in a bag . - Mommy ! - Duncan had tissue samples of the Castor original . SETH SHRIEKS My people will get you out of the country . Now we find Helena and we finish this shit . HE GASPS We should close his eyes . Yeah . - Do you want a drink ? - Yeah . OK . S. S is going to know how to get rid of it . Either that or someone she knows will . I 'm not asking her for anything else . Then , fine . I 'll ask . Because I 'm going to need a bath after we clean all of this up . Jesus Christ , what a mess . BANGING ON DOOR - Sarah ? We need to talk . - Art , it 's not a good time . - Why 'd you talk ? - Because he knows me ! Sarah , I got something . - Yep ! - I 'm really sick . I 've been throwing up for hours . Open the door ! One second ! One sec ! Yeah . BANGING CONTINUES OK . - Hey . - Hey , yourself . What 's going on ? Well , depends . What 's with you ? Nothing . - Hello , Arthur . - Felix . What 's up ? What do you need ? Oh that , yeah . That 's a new project . That 's very fresh . - What ? Art . - Art ? - Hey . - What is that ? - Art , do not go in there . What is that ? What ... OK . First off . It wasn 't us . Do you understand the position this puts me in ? We do , Art . But can 't you just , like , look away ? It 's a dead body , not a bag of weed . Well , look away , and it too will go up in smoke . Very professional , nothing on you . Hey , Art . Got someone who wants to meet you . Hi , Art , I 'm Cosima . Welcome to Clone Club . - Shit . - I know , sorry . I ... I knew Beth , I knew what she was going through . - We really miss her . - Yeah . Yeah , me too . Erm , Cos , what 's your take on these glitchy bastards ? Cos this one 's not talking . You said they were looking for samples of their original ? That 's very interesting . Yeah , here 's Scott . Hey . - Hello , Lieutenant Scotty . - Don 't call me that . No , he 's , like , barely a Trekkie , he only went to Comic-Con , like , once . - And it 's Lieutenant Commander . - Yeah , anyway ... ? Basically ... Dead guy 's symptomology sounds like they have a design flaw . - Yeah , like me . - Only neurological . Which explains why they need the original genome to find a cure . But that 's just hypothetical , unless ... Unless what , Scooter ? - Don 't call me that either . - Unless we examine his brain . His brain ? OK . Well , chop , chop , then , get over here . I don 't want any part in this . Sarah , come here . Do you want to see the body again ? - Yeah . - I really shouldn 't be doing this . You don 't have to , you just got back on the job . Which is how I got a lead on the Prolethean . Mark . You did ? CAR RACES BY Gracie ? Gracie ? Come inside . I went to get us breakfast . Please , don 't leave without me . It was just across the street . The baker had a turban . He said he makes the best cinnamon buns in the whole county . Your family will be looking for us , Gracie . Damn them if they want to ruin our honeymoon . There 's a whole world out there . - Why are we here ? - I told you , we 're just laying low . You sat up again last night . Why won 't you come to bed with me ? It 's not a sin . We 're husband and wife . - I know , I just ... - You can share your secrets now . Hey , say no to bullies , on the board or in the class . I will speak for your children , so you don 't have to . Hello , Vera ! Could I talk to you about Marci Coates ? She plans to re-zone the district . And have you seen her lunch proposals ? Nothing but starches . Sorry , I can 't ... You don 't have five minutes to talk about your kids ' education ? Alison , honestly ... Someone with your issues handling my children ... Of course . No , I understand . Er , we have something for you . From Ramone . We took over his business . Bath beads , body lotions , anything you need ... to relax . SHE COUGHS - Oh , there you go . - Thank you . Oh , oh , oh . Oh ! It 's 60 now . For the soap . Though we do offer discounts for referrals . So ... can I count on your support ? Well , tell me about this re-zoning thing ? THEY CHUCKLE At the military academy , the other boys did ... sex things . Chased girls . But not me . I was waiting ... I know this town . Willard Finch lives here . We 're not just laying low , are we ? Gracie . I 'm not who you think I am . I told your father that I went AWOL . But the truth is that ... I never left the army . What do you mean ? It 's all about your father . He stole valuable scientific material . I was assigned to recover it . We brought you in . - Trusted you ... - Gracie ... - All those years . - I 'm sorry . - It was all a lie ? No ! Gracie . We 're free of your people , but we are not clear of mine . I have to find something for them and then ... I can get out . That 's why we 're here ? You 're looking for something my father stole ? You think Willard Finch has it ? I think that he hid certain things for Henrick . Gracie ... You had to know your father had secrets ... No , I don 't know , I don 't know anything ! Gracie ... Don 't ask me " What for ? " , it 's personal ... Yes , I 'll be back by the end of the day . Beth couldn 't keep still , either . Well , it just doesn 't seem like these people get downtown much , does it ? Yeah , well , they all scattered after Helena torched the ranch . So the samples that these Castor guys are after ... Yeah . From the original . Blood slides and skin samples , that 's what Cosima said . So , what ... ? You 're thinking if you find them first , you can trade Helena for them ? Right . Hey . That 's the midwife . Here we go . Alexis McGann ? Recognise me ? I 'm looking for my sister . I don 't know where Helena is . I was cast out because of her . - I don 't give a shit . - What about him ? Mark fled ... with Gracie . They betrayed the family . He 's with the daughter ? Are they the ones who took Johanssen 's truck ? Uh-hm . Hey ! Look , Johanssen did something to my sister . What did he do ? She has a special purpose . What ? I don 't know what that means . What does that mean ? He harvested her eggs . And she 's pregnant with his child . Helena 's pregnant by him ? It 's a miracle . I didn 't know he would do it to Gracie too . - RADIO : - 55 , that vehicle was ticketed for speeding in Halton yesterday at 18 : 44 . 55 , roger . All I regret is breaking bread with abominations . - Trust me , if Helena 's an abomination , I 'm much worse . - Hey . Next time , she 'll bite your head off . Gracie ? I 've got to go and do this . This ... child inside me . You know what it is ... Yes ... I can 't do it alone . I 'll be there for both of you . I swear . Then , let me help you . Willard Finch is a dangerous man . If he was hiding something from my father , - he 's not just going to hand it over . - I can take care of myself . The last thing we need is another violent mess . You got a better idea ? DOG BARKS What ? DOG BARKS Hello , Mr Finch . Remember me ? Little Gracie Johanssen . You really have blossomed . Yes , sir . Thank you , Mr Finch . Just , uh , saying it was ... It was just a damn shame what happened to your daddy . He was a good man . Your father ... He always spoke well of you , too . Kept you under lock and key , though , these last few years , didn 't he ? We have our ways . Well , I remember a time when he used to bring you up here . I used to play in your fields , while you did business . - That 's right . - Which is why I 'm here . Oh ? To ... collect what you held in trust for him . There is a storage fee that 's applicable here . It 's 1,000 . - I don 't have it . - Oh ... that 's going to be a problem . The problem , Mr Finch , is your lack of faith in us . We Proletheans make fast friends , but fearsome enemies . Shall I distract my mother 's grief to tell her that you 're holding out for your 30 pieces of silver ? - You be sure to give your family my condolences . - Of course . So why did Mark take the girl ? He wanted a chew toy ? Come on , think like police . Why take baggage on the run ? Love ? Or a hostage . But , Art ... Shouldn 't you be getting back to your real job ? Johanssen was a large animal vet in Halton in the ' 80s . You 've got to read the entire file . There 's a KA . Known Associate ? Seriously , why are you doing this ? I don 't know . Because I 'm riding with my partner . - Art ... - Look , I 'm not confused , Sarah . But you are Beth 's sister ... through and through . I didn 't even know her . This isn 't your fight . She tried to tell me . What she was . She called me the night that she ... The night you came along . I thought it was the pills , more bullshit . I turned my back on her when she needed me most . You couldn 't have known . Yeah . But I should have . She was lucky to have you . Just look up that asshole KA for me . Let 's get your sister back . SHE CHANTS WEAKLY MAN SHOUTS VEHICLE APPROACHES Ma 'am , I can explain . - You killed your brother . - Virginia , calm down . He was stage five in the field . I had to . If you had followed Major Dierden 's extraction orders , he would have been at home . I 'm sorry , Mother , I 'm sorry . Hey ! He screwed up , but he had to put Seth down . It 's protocol . My office . Wait for me . Oh , shit . Come here , Doc . Bless you , Paul . Oh , yeah ... I 'm blessed all right ... It 's getting worse , isn 't it ? The Defect . You saw it . Seth went from asymptomatic to stage five in a day . What about Helena ? Any help ? We did the stress tests , the neuro-cog . She doesn 't have the Defect . Her biology may hold answers , but ... the fastest way to a cure is still the original genetic material . Well , I run field operations . I want Rudy confined to the base . But I run the Programme . We 've lost contact with Mark . - I need Rudy back in the field . - I 'll go after Mark . You can 't . It gets worse . The Director wants you in Arlington . Our weapon system has a glitch , Paul . We are one budget review from oblivion . They can 't shut us down . SHE SCOFFS I 've served with these men . We owe them . If you can protect them , I can cure them . Just buy us more time with the Director . SAW BUZZES You OK , Scotty ? You could barely get through the scalp , man . Oh , God ... Go easy on him , Cosima , Scott 's not a hardened criminal like you and I. - Once I got to the calvarium , I just ... - Scalpel ? Hey . You have done this before , yeah ? YouTube is an amazing resource . SQUELCHING Scott . No sign of aneurysm . No lesions . God , is this all we are ? Huh ? I mean , some neurons and axons , and a few pounds of grey matter ? How about we just get it back to the lab ? Yeah , but , like , when he died , you think what he saw was just a temporal lobe trip ... Oh . .. or did his soul actually say , " I 'm out of here , I 'm out of this dimension " ? Please , Cosima . This is weird enough . Scott . A good lab partner should be metaphysically empathetic . - Tongs or spoons ? - Uhh ... Oh , my God ! Well , I looked , shouldn 't have looked . OK ... Oh . Oh , bollocks . Receptacle ? Hey , you all right there , Igor ? Still with me ? HE GROANS Tell me what you see . Bird . Um ... Star . Knife . Close . Key . Your aphasia is improving already . And so will your motor skills , with the help of art and physiotherapy . Out ... Outside ? Sadly , the Rachel Duncan Topside knew has passed . Plane crash . Delphine ... I 'm ... I 'm ... finished . Let 's focus on your recovery . You 're more valuable than you know . Horses . GROANING ON RECORDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH Clear the room . At ease . - Man , I thought you were really mad at me . - I am . Your logs . Sit . Her name was Patty . Mark 's gone dark . Man , that guy is such a pussy . Don 't underestimate him . If he 's off task , just bring him home . And the Major ? I 'll handle the Major . Mom ? I saw it start , in Seth 's eyes . It took him so fast . Come . If there was any chance that Sarah still had the samples , I ... - I had to try . - My boy ... - Alison ! Hi ! - Hi . We heard about your new business . - Yeah . - Could we maybe get some ... soap ? Yes ! We have a special for new customers . Free sample ? Sure ! Have you two made your decision for School Trustee ? Still thinking about it . Don 't think too hard . Soap is the perfect cover . Ali , we 're going to break even in months . - Mm-hm . - We should have been drug dealers years ago . Pharmaceutical entrepreneurs , Donnie . As long as every new customer is a vote against Marci flippin ' Coates . KNOCK ON DOOR - Hello ! - Hi ! Marci . Oh , the kids said that you were in the garage . You shouldn 't be back here . There 's ... fumes . And lard . Well , this is , uh ... Quite the operation . I had no idea soap-making was so involved . Would you like a lesson ? Enterprising and a head for politics ? Quite the dark horse . What 's her secret ? Oh , you know . Just good old-fashioned stumping , Marci . We can 't all be the incumbent , so , some of us have to work for it . So , Alison . I have a little proposal for you . I can get you an amazing deal on this house . The sellers are very motivated . This is in a different school district . - Honey , they have a saltwater pool . - Donnie ! Look , Alison , you can buy a few votes with your soaps . You can quite possibly carve out some of my support , but you can 't actually win . Go sell a house , Marci . Do you seriously think that people are going to trust their children to an infamous alcoholic ? Why not ? They trusted a conniving , second-rate realtor . May the best woman win , Alison . Goodbye , Marci . I need to cut something . Drop the accent , this isn 't Scotland Yard . Willard Finch ? This is private property . Well , you 're a long way from home , son . That 's funny , I don 't look a thing like your son . That you wouldn 't . - We 're hunting this guy . - Can I ? - Yeah . Nope . Don 't know him . He 's travelling with the daughter of Henrick Johanssen . Who 's that now ? Henrick . He was part of your little militia back in the day . My little militia ? You remember ? Back when the Feds dug up all those guns in your corn field ? What 's your point ? One tip to the Feds and they 'll backhoe the whole thing again looking for your little arsenal . OK . I don 't know your friend here , OK ? This kid , I don 't know . But the daughter , young Gracie , she did swing by . What for ? To pass on the sad news . Women running things over there now too , huh ? What is this world coming to ? Is there anything else ? - Bye . - We 'll be in touch . You 're banished . We have no use for a midwife . Wait ! I know where Mark may have taken Gracie . It 's just junk . There 's no test tubes , no slides ... This is what he gave me . Biological samples need to be kept cold . - Did you see like a , a tank , or a cooler ? - No . - Think , Gracie . - I don 't know . - OK , it 's OK . I 'll just ... I 'll go back myself . - No , Mark ! - Don 't worry . - It 's too risky . You know what ? Just ... go down ... and treat yourself to something special . I 'll be back for you in an hour . Come home safe . OK ? Don 't you dare leave me alone . I won 't . Never . Got like , six hotels . They won 't give you anything over the phone . Got to go in , show them his picture . Shit . Hey , you 've got real fires to tend there . I 'll finish the canvas , you just go back . I 'll take the bus back tonight . I showed you a dead clone in a tub this morning . No , you did not . Just tell me you 're not risking your job , being here . Hm ? I may not be your partner , but I know when you 're holding back . Beth called you that night . Not Cosima . Not Alison . What is it you 're not telling me ? Just say it . I 've never said it . You were in love with her . And she was my partner . We were never going to be together , but ... .. it happened . You 're just as fierce as she was , Sarah . And you need my help , too . You 're no good to us suspended . We need you as a cop . Beth would want that . Be careful , OK ? We 're fierce , remember ? Call me if you need me . Don 't leave it too late . - Thought you 'd smell like Sarah . - Another one ? - You are the ugliest Mark yet . - Tell me something . Sarah Manning . The Gatherer of Sisters . But when she sold you out - when she gave you to us - that must 've been quite a blow . You come inside . I 'll tell you about it . Oh , sweetheart , there is nothing more that I would love . That 's enough . Just getting to know the enemy , Major . You have an assignment . - I will brief you , so this time you don 't stray . - Sir . SHE TUTS Dirty Paul . He lies with my sestras . Even Rachel . Come inside . Have another . You won 't believe me , but I am sorry it has come to this . One day ... I kill you all . SHE IMITATES A GUN FIRING Forgive me my trespasses against the family , Lord . Please keep Mark safe , and help guide us through this uncertainty . Amen . - Do you know who I am ? - Are you Sarah ? Helena told me about you . I didn 't really believe her . Yeah , she tells some bloody stories . I 'm looking for her . - We left her at the ranch . I don 't know where she is . - And Mark ? He and his brothers know where she is . My husband doesn 't have any brothers . - Husband ? Congratulations . - Thank you . You 're the first person I 've told . Did Helena tell you I have a kid ? Yes . My kid and yours are going to be cousins . I know you 're carrying Helena 's baby . That does not make us family . Why ? Because we 're " abominations " ? I don 't really know what to think any more . There 's a lot Mark 's not telling you . He was sent by the army . Yeah , to collect scientific material for my father . I know , he told me . Didn 't tell you about his brothers , though , did he ? - There 's probably more of them . - He 's ... He 's a ... Hey , hey , hey . Helena 's the mother of your kid , and she 's in trouble . I need to know where Mark is . Gracie took everything . All right ? We 've got nothing to talk about here , kid . Just you go and tell Bonnie that , would you ? Bonnie didn 't send me . In the field , there are only two types of prisoners . Assets , and liabilities . Ow , ow , ow , ow , ow , ow ... OK , OK ! Be an asset , Willard . Where are the rest of Henrick 's things ? OK . I don 't know any more than what I told you ... HE SCREAMS Where ? Willard ? Hello , Gracie . Mother ... Your family cares for you , Gracie . Even as you refuse to care for yourself . You 've been crying . I made a mistake . Mark , he ... He took advantage of you . Yes . And your stupidity . We let a wolf into our flock . And you ran . I had doubts , Mother . When your father told me you would be the one to carry the child I ... I struggled . Lord , I struggled . But you didn 't stop him . We 're not like other people . We have a purpose . We still have purpose . It 's like Swiss cheese in here . Amyloid plaques , rampant cell death . Like spongiform encephalopathy ? Yes , like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . He wouldn 't have lasted a week . No wonder they 're so motivated . SHE COUGHS Assays done ? A few . Yeah . Just cross-referencing against Leda DNA . See if it brings up a new synthetic sequence . - Scott ... ? - Hmm ? Hello ? Hello ? Hey . You 're not going to believe this , um , cos I don 't either . 'I just thought , you know , what 's a few hundred matching base pairs ? 'But it 's almost half a gigabase . ' Not a good time , Cosima . Tell her about the loci ! Yeah , a dozen short tandem repeat loci in common . That can only mean one thing , Sarah . In English , I hope . The boy clones are our brothers . What ? CLATTERING ( Shit ! Shit ! I 've got to go . ) Sarah ? Hello ? Heart attack . I thought he could take it , but ... he must have had a heart condition . How did you find this place ? Had a chat with your blushing bride . Gracie ? What did you tell her ? She knows you 're like us . She knows you 're just like us , a clone . What have you done ? What I had to to get Helena back . I don 't care about Helena . You have to . She 's your sister . You 're lying . - I 'm your sister , Mark . - You 're lying ! GUN COCKS We did the science . You 're ... you 're my family . You would say anything to get your sister back . Think about it . Castor and Leda . Two donors . Two originals . Siblings . You are not my family . Now , I need to go find Gracie . Mark ! Mark ! GUNSHOT HE GROANS Mrs Johanssen . Please . We shared everything with you , Mark . Our home . Our hearts . Our daughter . Now you 'll answer to us . Wait . Please . I love her . Not like her mother . GUNSHOT BIRDS CRY You 're the one with the blessed child . - Guards ! - You 're a shit mother ! - There was a car following me . - Was it Marci Coates ? - My boss wants a meeting . - Whoa , mister , that 's my wife . - Shut up . I 'm not going to let an app decide who I love . Nobody meets anyone in person any more , darling . There you are , Mommy .

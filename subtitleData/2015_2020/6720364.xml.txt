 What if luck is something - you could own ? - What ? Oh , did that ... missing stripper ... of yours ever turn up ? Kayleigh 's gone , JC . I need to talk to Freddie ! She 's gone ! Listen to me ! JC ! - You 're still gambling , aren 't you ? What ? I never expected to find you still here , Harry . Why are you texting a dead man , Harry ? You can 't investigate a murder if you 're considered a suspect . This is Kayleigh Fenchurch . Yeah , I know who she is but why is she next to my victim , Freddie Lau ? Because she was strangled , too . Your father knew . He knew he was going to be killed . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Either she helps me get out of here or they 're gonna catch me . And I will not keep my mouth shut . Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck . Well , that 's shite . Kevin Grey , stop ! On your knees now ! Let 's go . Go , go , go . Original air date : 2016 , January 29 Subs by mielb Follow the lady , come on ! - Come on , let 's play ! Follow the lady . Come on , ladies and gentlemen . It 's in the middle ? Who is in the middle ? No ? Come on , bet . Bet , bet bet ! Come on ! - Are you sure ? - Yes , yes ! Come on ! - Are you sure ? - Yes . Sorry . - Try again ? - OK , again . Let 's try again . So ... follow the lady , OK ? Is it here ? Two , three ... it 's here ? - - This one . - Sure ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ! Are you sure ? - Yes , yes , come on . - Are you sure ? Are you sure ? This is a cheat ! This is a cheat ! It 's a cheat ! This is life . Always . Win some ... lose some . We need to go . Look straight ahead . He 's been in cold water so we 'd like to run some more tests . If he suffered a concussion , we need to know . Despite being immerged , his lungs are being clear , his blood pressure 's high . Thank you . My god ! What a mess ! Yeah . How is he ? - You 're OK ? - I 'm fine . Honestly . Ben , take it slowly . They 've given me a thorough gaze over . Alright . Thanks to you , hero . You 've been in a serious accident . Why didn 't you let them check you ? No , I 'm going . Give you a text . We 'll give you a lift . I 'm not going in a vehicle with you . I should go to bed . Thanks . I can never get them myself as these . All it takes is patience . When are you going back to your meetings ? I 've already started . Going most evenings after work . But not last night . So ... What happened ? Nothing , just the usual . That 's two lies in a row . Harry ... That was a rough night . I just ... wanted to come and see you . Dad ! Daisy ! Hello , love ! How is that arm ? - Good . - Yeah ? Kevin Grey has been on the move for five hours . We 're viewing CCTV footage but there 's a lot of blind spots , so we have to concentrate on this ... Detective Chohan . A word ? I see you 're doing Harry 's paperwork for him . That 's ... dutiful of you . Well , to be frank , after what he did last night , I thought he could use a break . Yes , he did very well . Harry 's a great man for a crisis . He 's decisive , brave , heroic even . I mean , it 's obvious why you admire him . Very few of us could have done what he did last night . Then again , even fewer of us would have allowed that situation to develop . It was ... risky what he did . It is curious , don 't you think ? All this chaos ... and as ever , not a scratch on Harry Clayton . Something 's not right here . What 's the simple solution to the Kayleigh Fenchurch and Lau murders ? That Kevin Grey killed them both because he was jealous that Kayleigh left him for Lau . Yeah , but if it was a simple crime of passion why would Grey need a speedboat and a plane to flee the country ? No , Kayleigh was murdered as a message for Freddie Lau , but Freddie failed to listen . Somehow Grey was ... manipulated into killing him . No mention of Kevin Grey on the paperwork . Or any passengers . Do we know where Grey was headed ? The manifest says Paris , Dubai and then Macao . You speak Chinese ? Cantonese , just a little . Oh , of course you do . Must brush up on it myself . The hire code is 26 Broadworth street . The Green Dragon casino . OK , so Lily-Anne wanted Kevin Grey out of the country . But why this ? Why need a private plane ? I mean , how many millions is this worth ? A walnut finish , fancy upholstery ... Oh , Lily-Anne ! Where 's Kevin Grey ? I 've no idea . Even though he was about to get on a private plane hired by you ? You mean the plane picking up relatives for my father 's memorial ? Is hiring a plane a crime ? No , but stuffing it full of cash is . Oh dear . I 'm afraid I must plead ignorant on that front . Maybe just speak to the charter 's company . Lily-Anne , did you force Kevin Grey into killing your father ? Detective Clayton , what must you think of me ? No , I don 't think you did . Someone else did . Someone you 're afraid of . Lily-Anne , tell me where Kevin Grey is , I can protect you . I think we both know why you really came here . There 's tables upstairs , they 're calling your name . You know , Harry ? My father liked men like you . Weak , broken men ... You reminded him of himself . That 's why he gave you credit . And weak and broken as you are , you abused that credit . So now ... I own you , detective Clayton . You 're mine to do it as I please . Dismissed . But you , my Lord , are a shield about me , the lifter of my head . I cried aloud to the Lord , and He answered me from His holy mountain . I lie down and sleep . Clayton was definitely into Lau for a very large sum . Everyone says so . I want evidence . Somebody out there has a record of this transaction . - I 'll keep looking , sir . - No . No , that 's not good enough . Do you understand what I was sent here to do , Orwell ? I 've come here to clean this rotten organisation from within and I 'm trusting you to work with me on this . - Hi . - Good morning . Is your daddy home ? Who is it , darling ? Yes ? I 'm looking for Harry Clayton . I 've no idea where he is . Perhaps I can come inside and discuss it ? Absolutely not . Who are you ? Well , another time then . Have a nice day ... Anna . Who was that ? No one . Just go and get dressed . Anna ? Why is there a bailiff at my door ? OK , I 'm on my way . Don 't worry , I handled it . But please , no more , Harry . The new chief wants to speak to you . You want to see me ? I have information that you owed Lau a large sum of money . Money that you could not possibly pay back on a detective 's salary . Who said that ? You 're not denying , then ? I 'm not responding to some ... rumour . Who told you that ? I like to protect my sources as much as you . In any case , it doesn 't matter . But what would matter is if you let Grey escape in order to keep the suspicion on him . - You think I killed Freddie Lau ? - You certainly had the motive . I nearly lost my life trying to catch Grey last night . Recklessness won 't win you any points . - I 'm going back to work . - D.I. Clayton , if you can 't , or won 't ... find Grey , Orwell will . Orwell ? He couldn 't find his face in a mirror . Scrap everything you heard . I want to keep it tight . I want you to start here , set a radius and just sweep . Alright ? Door to door . House to house . No one 's talking about Grey . The street shout is all about Kayleigh Fenchurch 's funeral . Did you get anything from Lily-Anne ? No , nothing except a plausible denial . What 's he gonna do ? Is he gonna search the whole of London , street by street , in the hope of finding him ? Grey is in the wind . Still can 't believe they let him commandeer my map . I 've brought these pins from home . Talk to me about you bringing - Grey 's getting out of the country quick and quiet . Who could fix that for him ? Very good . I don 't know . But I know a man who might . Come on . Josie . Boss , there 's a certain smell of bacon in the shop . Don 't flirt , Josie , I 'm a married man . Jesus , Josie . I thought you meant the actual police . Just have to have a quick word with my brother . Take a look , around . Did you manage to look into the ... the thing ? Your wee bracelet ? Scrape test came back , inconclusive . What does that mean ? The machine 's buggered . Happens . Rich , someone tried to kill me over this , tried to chop my bloody arm off . That 's driving me a bit crazy . That thing might even be ... powerful . But how could she get it on in the first place ? Harry , are you on crack ? - Just find out what it is , will you ? - OK . I will . Is this cuneiform , Mr Clayton ? Oh please , it 's Rich . And ... yes , yes it is . Yours for only 200 grand . You must know how to get your hands on things . Well , I 've got that reputation . Great , you can help us then . We 're looking for Kevin Grey , a murder suspect . We believe he 's in imminent flight risk . What 's that got to do with me ? If you needed to flee the country without being traced , how would you do it ? I ... have no idea . I mean , I might know some back channels for a few things , but ... professional ethics , and all that . OK . We 'll try somewhere else then . Good luck . Just one more thing . That 's a Babylonia Museum mark . So unless you 've got paperwork , it 's been looted . And since you 're not involved in anything like that , I know you 'd want us to call the Iraqi embassy for you . Professional ethics , and all that . Rich , I didn 't properly introduced you . This is D.S. Chohan . She 's ... very good . You need a fake passport and transport . I 've heard of one in the Garden that there 's this new guy . Follow the lady , come on . - The cards are a distraction . Why else do it here ? See ? I 'll get him , you get the card guy . No , wait . Let 's test us on . Are you sure ? Follow the lady , eh ? She 's here ? No ? Here ? Choose . Let 's play again ... Yeah ? And I 'll beat you this time . - I 'll give you four to one . - Four to one ? Yeah . OK ? - OK . - OK ? Just follow the lady , eh ? Choose . How do you do that ? Let 's play again . But just play , no bet , OK ? - OK . - OK ? Choose . Come on , choose ! How do you do that ? Police ! Well , what do we do now ? Like I said , cards are just a distraction . Hello ? Well , if it isn 't Barry the wizard . - How you doing , big man ? - Ah , Clayton . Not a social call , I expect . Alas , no . Listen , what can you tell me about the phone I 'm calling from ? Can you give me the name of the owner , an address ? No . It 's prepaid , purchased near Tottenham Court road . Looking in my maps ... It shows up most in a mock-up garage ... it 's in Bermondsey . OK , text an address to me , will you , Barry ? Thanks . OK , will do . Hey , nice to ... Right , let 's follow the lady , shall we ? Hello . Nice place you 've got there . Interesting stuff . Oh ! The Green Dragon . Thanks . Immigration 's been all over you . How did you beat me ? Ah , customers . Kevin Grey . This man 's wanted for murder . Where is he ? - How ? - We need to know tonight ! No ? Tell you what , why don 't I ... call some of the contacts in your phone , eh ? Ask them a few questions , try not to make it too obvious that I 'm police ? You may even survive the night . - How did you beat me , man ? - Where 's Kevin Grey ? Tell me . OK . You tell me where Kevin Grey is , I 'll tell you how I beat you . Yeah , he called me . And he begged like a dog . So I got him a space , in a storage crate on a ship to Greece . It leaves Portsmouth at noon . I don 't know where he is now but , that 's where he 'll be tomorrow . Now tell me , how did you beat me ? Eh , you can 't leave me here ! You lied to him . He didn 't have a tell . His cheat never twitched . No , it didn 't . So , how did you do it ? Don 't leave me like this ! Come on ! Don 't leave me like this ! What are we doing with him ? He 'll get out eventually . Let him play for now . Besides we put a shiny new source for ourselves . A guy that can fake passports and find transports available on demand . Yeah ? Our info 's that Grey will be in a storage leaving Portsmouth docks at noon tomorrow . Just let you know we 'll be there to pick him up . What 's Orwell got ? I haven 't caught up with him yet . Good work , Harry . Harry got there first . Tired of all this ... talk . I 'm going to get you something you can take to Internal Affairs . Soon . I hope so . When Clayton 's gone , I 'm gonna need somebody I can trust . I am your eyes and ears , sir . OK , so there 's a train at 8 : 36 in the morning . Great . So , having some dinner ? Pint ? You 're gonna see Ben . - He said he needed rest . - Yeah , that was in front of me . Go and ... tuck him in . I can 't believe I 'm getting advice on my personal life from Harry , " Lose my house in a card game " , Clayton . Right ... I 'll see you tomorrow morning at Waterloo then . Alright . Just after eight , OK ? By which stage , my private affairs will be 100 % in order . We 're closed tonight ... Out of respect . I 've got a line on Kevin Grey . Thought I 'd give you the chance to tell me anything you know before he does ... since we 're such good friends . And what would I know ? Who convinced Grey to kill Lau ? Your view of the world is very dark and twisted , detective . Whoever was trying to force Lau out got to Grey . Lily-Anne ? Someone else ? You can tell me ... or Grey will . The girl he was crazy about was found in the Thames . Grey blamed the guy who took her from him . But then he just happened to try and board a plane hired by Lily-Anne ? If you have a charge , why don 't you put the cuffs on me and we can cha-cha ? If not , I have Kayleigh 's funeral to arrange . There . You 're very welcome to attend . If you can find the time . Hi . - Hello . - Look , last night made me think ... I mean , there 's a lot of problems ... We work together , I 'm Hindu , you 're nothing , I support the Spurs , you 're a bloody gooner ... And we 're both a bit new with cranky emotions . But I 've decided that we 're going out now . Officially . Cause I might love you a bit . And I think you love me a bit back . Mainly cause you 're not stupid . OK ? OK . God ! That was awful . Say , can I come in and get naked with you , please ? What is it ? Hello , dear . You must be Ben 's mum . Come in . My little boy 's got ... very bad eyesight . A few months , he 'll be ... bu ... bu ... blind . Phil , stop looking at your phone . She 's mmm ... making me fall asleep . There 's a new treatment in Prague . And they just won 't do it here but ... I 'll try anything . So my mum 's cashed in her icy savings to pay for us to go , but I c ... ca ... ca ... I lost it all . I love my son ... so much . But I f ... fa ... I messed everything up . Again . So that 's it . Harry ... You haven 't been here for a while . Do you want to share anything ? Hello , everyone . My name is Harry C. I 'm a compulsive gambler . I haven 't placed a bet for ... four days . Hi , Harry . You 're all making me feel so old . Didn 't realize they let toddlers do bets . Is there a reason you come back ? Someone asked me a question the other day . What if luck was something you could own ? What if someone gave you something that made you ... really lucky ? Something that caused amazing things to happen . I 'd get rid of it . What if you couldn 't ? It 's mad . I know , it 's mad . Harry , this is your disease talking . Go home . Write everything down . Winnings and losses . You 'll see exactly what this charm of yours is costing you . And we 're on ! - Thank you . - We 're about to start the race . One minute . One minute now . - Six 's still last - I 'll swap you . What ? Swap tickets . I got number 1 . You know what ? Yeah . There seems to be a problem with the hare . The dogs are all falling out except for 6 , 6 goes on , it 's the last bend ... 6 enters the last straight and 6 crosses the line . Did you fix this ? No . Due to a mechanical error , the race is void . All bets are cancelled . Return your tickets for refund . Yeah , well . You can thank your lucky stars , mate . Harry . You ! What do you think you 're doing ? That bracelet 's not for playing games . What is it for ? You know ... what it is . You felt its power . Really ? Why did you give it to me ? To shine a light in the shadows . What ? You have to go . Now . We have to run , trust me ! Harry ? - Harry ! - He tried to kill me . Luck like this has its price . Do something good with it ! Morning , Chohan . - Is that the walk of shame I see ? - Please , stop talking . - Ah , young love , remember it well . - Shut up . Endless hours of poetry , baths , stubborn rash ... What train are we on , the 8 : 36 ? A-ha . Did you get our tickets ? Yes , mum . Got them here . 8 : 36 . Wait . Kevin Grey loved Kayleigh Fenchurch . He 's not gonna be in our boat . He 's gonna pay his respects . We have to act on our information . It 's too big a risk . He 's gonna be at Kayleigh 's funeral . This is our one chance at catching him . Trust me . This is something I wrote . " K " is for krazy , the times we had together . " A " is for amazing , the memories that will live with me forever . " L " is for love , which is what I felt for you . " I " is for intelligent , the jokes that made me laugh . " G " is for gorgeous ... - He 's not here . - you even looked good in a bath . He will be . Hold on , I 'll call you back in a second . Hello . Harry , where are you ? Just pulling into the harbour station now . Anything happened on the journey ? No . Listen , I can 't really talk . We 're getting a bit close , time-wise . Indeed . Well , I look forward to see you when you 're back at headquarters . Come on ... Here 's a tissue , sweetie . This is a funeral , detective . Have you no shame ? You know , I thought the authorities back home were stupid , but not even these hairy good feetless would be so idiotic to expect a fugitive ... to attend the funeral of his victim . Ladies and gentlemen , our boys and girls in blue . What 's happening now ? Nothing . I can 't believe I didn 't get on that train . We 've blown it . Doesn 't make sense . I 'm sorry . I hate these places . Oh God ! Oh no ! It 's alright , boys . I 'm gonna get us out of here . Jesus ! Come on ! Get your seat belt off . You can do it . I 'll take care of Frank . - Go ! Go ! - Mummy ! Go , Harry ! Go ! It 'll be fine ! Go ! You 're OK ? I haven 't been to a funeral since I was five years old . My brother ... my twin brother and I were in a car accident . My mother was driving . I was OK , I got out , but they ... I spent the entire service hiding underneath a pew . I could feel everyone looking at me , thinking : maybe it 's his fault ? I 'm sure they weren 't , Harry . Maybe they were just wondering why you were hiding underneath the pew ? Grey can 't face the family . Not if they thought he killed her . Kevin ... Kevin , don 't . Kevin , don 't ! - Grey ! - Stop ! - You 're OK ? - Go ! - Take him and give me five minutes . - We need to have a drink . Yeah , I know . Hi , Steve ? What 's going on ? Train crash , Harry . We were meant to be on that train . You 're a lucky man , Harry Clayton . We 're getting raw images coming in from today 's rail incident . There are currently around 40 injured reported , no fatalities have been confirmed as yet . 15 : 35 on April the 3rd . Interviewing the suspect Kevin Grey are D.I. Clayton and D.S. Chohan . Noting that the suspect has agreed to be interviewed without having a lawyer present . Can we hurry this up ? Have you got somewhere to be ? Who told you that Freddie Lau had killed Kayleigh ? Or why else would you have murdered him ? You thought Freddie had taken the life of the woman you loved . I know Freddie didn 't do it . I did . Sorry ? I 'm pleading guilty for both murders , your honour . We 're not charging you for Kayleigh 's murder . Why are you lying ? Mr Grey ? I 'm here to represent you . - Who are you ? - Your solicitor . Interview suspended at 15 : 36 . - Who send you ? - My firm . - What are you doing ? - My job . Can we just be professional about this ? We 're still a married couple , remember ? - We both can 't work on this case . - Well , then why don 't you go home ? Next please . How is your son ? 3,80 please . Yeah . Here . Keep the change . - This is thousands . - Take it . Only for trip expenses , right ? I can 't . Please . I don ... - I don 't want charity . - You 'd be helping me . Honestly . That 's not for you or me . I wanna come back here . I wanna see photos of your wee lad playing football in the park . Don 't let me down . Thank you . What 's up ? This is just between us . It bothers me that Harry put you both in danger to catch Grey . Yeah but we caught him , didn 't we ? And there was no easy way anyone could have managed it . Also , you know as well what a proper male 'd say ? I do . But please , rest one day ... I 'm just wo ... How about you stop talking about Harry when you 're in bed with me ? Should we get the iPad out and watch " Modern Family " ? Why don 't you do it later ? I feel a bit tired . - - Ben , are you OK ? Yeah , I just need ... - Suri . - Harry ! It 's Ben ! He 's ... He 's ... - What ? - I just called an ambulance . I 'm on my way . We 're nearly at the hospital . We 're getting there . -

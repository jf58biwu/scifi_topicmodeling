 Previously on The Shannara Chronicles ... EVENTINE : The Ellcrys will bear a seed that must be carried to a place called Safehold . Arggh ! ANDER : Arion , my father , all gone . ALLANON : And now you are king . BANDON : It 's like he 's inside my head . - Who ? - The Dagda Mor . BANDON : Making me do things . - ( GRUNTS ) - ( GAGS ) SOLIDER : What are those creatures doing here ? The Gnomes come in peace , fight the Demons as our allies . ( CRIES OUT ) AMBERLE : It 's the Bloodfire . I need to get inside . WIL : Amberle ! ALLANON : The Ellcrys is dying . As it sheds its leaves , a Demon army forms , preparing to unleash its evil on our world . ( ROARS ) ( CALLS OUT IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( DREAMY MUSIC ) ( WOMAN 'S VOICE ECHOES ) We 're out of time , Amberle . The last leaf has fallen in Arborlon . I can 't believe it 's really you . I 've been listening to your voice since I was just a girl . You were never just a girl . Every step you 've taken was meant to bring you here . The Bloodfire is the earth 's life force . It 's where the past , present and future meet . It is your destiny . But I don 't understand . Why me ? You were chosen ... like I once was . Fate has tied us to the Ellcrys . As I end , you will begin . End ? But I can save you . I have the seed . You are the seed , Amberle . SONG : ♪ I feel it running through my veins ♪ And I need that fire ♪ Just to know that I 'm awake . ♪ Eretria ? Don 't do this to me . I can 't lose you too . I won 't . No . No . Amberle . Help . ( GASPS ) Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Hey . Wil , what happened ? You lost too much blood . I thought you were ... ( STAMMERS ) But the Stones brought you back . Yeah . I guess you 're a hero after all . Where is she ? Uh ... She didn 't make it out . We need to open it back up . ( BREATHES SHAKILY ) ( ERETRIA MOANS ) WIL : Amberle ! ( VOICE ECHOES ) WOMAN : I warned you your feelings for Wil would hold you back . You must be willing to let him go . There has to be another way . This is the only way . You must choose . You must choose to sacrifice yourself . I said no . I 'm sorry . I can 't . I just can 't . Then you have doomed us all . Amberle ! ( AMBERLE GASPS ) ( ALL WEEP ) What happened in there ? It 's hard to explain . But you have the seed ? But the last leaf has fallen in Arborlon . The Dagda Mor is free . ( DEMONS ROAR AND BELLOW ) ( DAGDA MOR SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) The princess has emerged from the Bloodfire . She 's coming home ? Yes , but the Dagda Mor is aware of her presence , so we must prepare . I 'll send word to the scouts , move the citizens to the tunnels and mobilise the army . That would be the wise decision , Your Highness . I 'm still not used to people calling me that . Only a king knows the weight of a crown . 30 years ago , I stood under very similar circumstances beside your father . Did you have any words of inspiration for him ? Don 't fail . Anyone remember how to get out of this place ? I 'm working on it . When we do , how do we get back to Arborlon ? Nobody said it was gonna be easy . We 're gonna make it . - We just have to ... - ( ROARING ) RUN ! ( SNARLING AND ROARING ) ANDER : The Demons outnumber us 1,000 to 1 . We cannot beat them in the field , which means restoring the Ellcrys is our only hope . Allanon assures rne that Amberle has the seed and is on her way . Slanter , your men will form a perimeter and push into the woods beyond the Sanctuary . ( MURMURS ) Commander Tilton and I will take the Elvin army and fortify the Sanctuary itself . We 'll be the last line of defence for whatever breaks through . ( ROARING IN DISTANCE ) ( GRUNTS ) Wil , help me ! - ( ROARING GETS NEARER ) - We have to go ! WIL : Let 's go ! Help me close this thing . Ugh ! It 's stuck ! ( ROARING ) WIL : Just leave it . We can outrun them . What are you doing ? ! - AMBERLE : Hey ! - NO ! I bought you some time . Use it ! You can 't do this ! We have to go back together . No , YOU have to go back . Don 't you get it ? We all have a part to play . I 'm doing mine . Now it 's up to you . Wil ... stop . No ! We 're not leaving you here . That 's insane . Wil ! It 's not up to you . We 'll come back for you . I promise . ( ROARING ) Go ! ( ERETRIA GRUNTS IN DISTANCE ) Oh ... Wil ! ( YELLING IN DISTANCE ) ( TROLLS CHATTER ) Wil ... We have to go . She wants us to go . Hyah ! For the boy . King Ander 's orders . ( GATE CLUNKS ) I never meant to hurt you . It 's OK . It 's OK . How can I help ? ( WHISPERS ) I need you to get me far away , somewhere where I can 't hurt anybody . But I can 't . Catania do you trust me ? Yes . Then get ready to scream . ( SCREAMS ) Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . Give me the keys or I snap her neck . - Now ! - ( CATANIA WHIMPERS ) Drop the sword . Step back . Just let us go . He 's not going to hurt you . - ( SCREAMS ) - Don 't touch her ! - CATANIA : No ! - ( SOLDIER GAGS ) ( CRACK ! ) No ! Bandon , stop ! Stop ! No ! ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTS ) He shouldn 't have touched you . SONG : ♪ Run , boy , run ♪ This world is not meant for you ♪ Run , boy , run They 're trying to catch you ♪ Run , boy , run ... Running is a victory ♪ Run , boy , run Beauty lies behind the hills ♪ Run , boy , run The sun will be guiding you ♪ Run , boy , run ... They 're dying to stop you ♪ Run , boy , run This race is a prophecy ♪ Run , boy , run ... Break out from society ... ♪ Nothing from the scouts . We should head down . The men will want to see you . We were supposed to get married . Remember ? Once upon a time . Well , I never officially agreed to that . I 'm sorry it took the end of the world for me to realise what a fool I 've been . ( HORN BLARES IN DISTANCE ) It 's time . Lead the way , Commander . I have never been so happy to see anything in my entire life . ( BELLOWING IN DISTANCE ) ( GRUNTING AND SHOUTING ) ( GRUNTING AND SHOUTING CONTINUES ) No ... - ( BELLOWS ) - ( DEMONS RESPOND ) We can 't get through , not on horseback , not without them seeing us . No , there has to be a way . We have to get to the Ellcrys . Alright . We 'll need cover , then . We need to find somewhere safe to wait for dark . I know somewhere . Come on . ( DEMONS GRUNT AND CHATTER ) Thanks . Wil ... WIL : Won 't be long . AMBERLE : I know . I just ... I wanted to tell you that I 'm that I wish things could be different . You know , I wish we could ... I wish we could 've met before all this . Hey . We made it . We 're almost home . And when we finish this when everyone 's safe , we 'll have all the time in the world to do things differently . But what if we didn 't have time ? Don 't talk like that . We 're gonna make it . No , I know . I 'm not afraid anymore . Eretria was right - this is my part . I know what I have to do , and ... it 's OK . ( DREAMY , TENDER INDIE MUSIC ) But I need to tell you something first . Of course . I love you , Wil Ohmsford . And I 'm not ready to let you go , not yet . And I know it 's terrible timing and everything ... SONG : ♪ Ohh-oh-oh Ohh-oh-oh ♪ Ohh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ Lost , lost ... I I love you too . I always have . ♪ Lost ♪ But not alone anymore ♪ This ancient light ♪ This ancient light ♪ This ancient light ♪ This ancient light ... ♪ It 's dark . We should head out . What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's ... Everything 's perfect . I 'm ready . Then let 's go save a tree . ( SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( DEMONS BELLOW ) ALLANON : Our hope lies in a single seed being carried here by your princess , Amberle , and the last son of Shannara . With it , we can send this Demon horde back to the Forbidding . For this to happen , we must buy them time . We must hold this line and defend the Ellcrys at all cost . I know we can win this war because I have stood alongside your King Eventine , and as fate would have it , I now stand alongside his son , King Ander . ( SOLDIERS SHOUT ) Long live King Ander ! Your princess is out there ... right now scared just like you , giving everything she has to save us all . We must match her bravery with our own . And if we die tonight , let us fall so the Ellcrys may rise again so every race in the Four Lands may have a future to call its own ! ( ALL CHEER ) ( DEMONS GRUNT AND SHOUT ) ( DEMONS CHANT ) ( DEMONS CONTINUE CHANTING ) ( CHANTING CONTINUES ) ANDER : Steady ! Elves , ready ! ELVES : Hah ! ( DEMONS BELLOW ) Arggh ! Forward ! ( ALL SHOUT AND YELL ) WIL : ls there a secret way in ? A back door or something ? No , not this far out . ( GRUNTING ) Quick . ( WIL WHISPERS ) It 's a patrol . ( SNIFFS ) It smells us . Arggh ! Die , you bastard . ( DEMONS SHOUT ) ( ARROWS WHISTLE ) Allanon . Perfect timing , as usual . ALLANON : I wish I could say the same for you , but the idea was to get here before the Demons arrived . See ? Told you he 'd be happy to see us . ( GNOMES GRUNT ) The Gnomes are with us . Are you ready to see this through , Princess ? Stay behind us . And don 't slow down . ( ALL CLAMOUR AND GRUNT ) Secure the door ! ( BELLOWS ) ( ELVES SCREAM ) Arggh ! ( SCREAMS ) Ander ! Wait ! ( SCREAMING ) ( ROARS ) Arion ? - ( GROWLS ) - Ugh ! ( ROARS ) ( ARION GROANS ) Arion . What are you waiting for ? Release me ! Please . Please . Goodbye , brother . ( BOTH EXCLAIM ) Secure the door ! Keep moving ! ( CHUCKLES ) Run for the Ellcrys now ! - Protect her ! - Protect the princess ! WIL : I told you we 'd make it . Arggh ! ( SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( LAUGHS ) ( YELLS ) Alright , where 's the seed ? I tried to tell you earlier . Oh , please don 't say you dropped it . I don 't think I could take that right now . It 's me , Wil . I 'm the seed . What do you mean ? I have to become the Ellcrys . That 's how we save it , how we save everyone . I don 't understand . You ... you can 't just become a tree . - I mean , what happens to ... - Wil , please . Please . I need you to understand . I won 't make it otherwise . - ( ROARING ) - Ugh ! ELF : The door ! To the door ! ( BOTH GRUNT ) WIL : Amberle ! Wait ! Arggh ! ( WIL MOANS ) Ugh ... ( GROANS ) WOMAN 'S VOICE : Amberle ... ELF : What 's going on ? WIL : Amberle . Please talk to me . WIL : I know you 're in there somewhere . I can 't hear her . Can 't hear anything . She will speak when she is ready . Be patient , Wil . You knew this was gonna happen , didn 't you ? You lied to us . It would not have helped if you knew . Really ? You just decided that on your own ? What about Amberle ? Didn 't she deserve to know ? Amberle made the decision , not me , Wil . She understood the price . So when you told me that I could protect her , that was a lie too . You made me believe she could be saved . Instead , I lost another person that I loved . Saving the Four Lands in the process , Wil . Do not forget that . I told you that magic comes with a price . You didn 't say it was her life ! - Wil ... - Stop . Leave me alone . Your father would have been proud of your actions today . As am I. ( RUMBLING ) ( GATE CLUNKS ) CATANIA : I had a dream Bandon was alone , drowning in a sea of black . This is my fault . I failed him . We both did . You wanted to see me , Your Grace . ANDER : Yes . I wanted to thank you ... for everything . It was my duty . I sent soldiers to find my brother 's body , but there was no sign of him , or the Warlock sword . I saw him in there , Allanon , even in that ... twisted form . It was Arion . He asked me to kill him . The Dagda Mor 's cruelty had no bounds . I 've been to the Sanctuary to to see Amberle . I know her sacrifice saved us , but I just can 't believe that she 's gone . She is still with you , My Grace . She is watching over us all . ( WIND HOWLS ) ( TENSE MUSIC ) ( HORSE WHINNIES ) For what it 's worth , I 'm grateful to you for showing me who I am . I 'm sure we 'll meet again one day . I sense that our journey has just begun . The Dagda Mor may be gone , but his presence has stirred other evils . Then let them come . But there 's something I 've gotta do first . You 're going to Safehold . You don 't know whether the Rover girl is alive or dead . The mind-reading thing ? Still really annoying . I promised Eretria I 'd go back . I 'm not gonna lose her too . WIL : Huh ! ( GRAND MUSIC ) ( ERETRIA GRUNTS ) It 's you !

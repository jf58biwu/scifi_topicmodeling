A lucid dream is a dream during which the dreamer is aware of dreaming . CULPRIT CAUGHT BY LUCID DREAMS " Culprit caught " ? So-hyun ? I need the results organized and uploaded as soon as possible , for my next paper . Yes , Doctor . Please , So-hyun ! I can use this to find clues . It says it 's actually been used for investigations abroad . They caught the culprits ! I 'm a doctor . I 've only used it for therapy . It 's not an investigation . For me , it 's therapy . The side effects have not been established yet . Not adhering to the rules and time can cause cerebrovascular problems . I 'll stick to the rules . Don 't worry . I 'm sorry , Dae-ho . I understand how you feel , but ... You understand me ? No . You have no idea . Every second of every day is so painful ! Please , So-hyun . You need a reality check to tell if you 're in a dream or not . We call it an RC for short . It depends on how you set it up . How do we set it ? Well , I set it as a clock . When you enter your dream , check your watch or the clocks . The hour and minute hands will move , but the second hand won 't . If you want to wake up , press this chime bell . It 'll stimulate your brain and you will wake . Regardless , a timer will automatically wake you up in ten minutes . Longer than ten minutes is dangerous . Think about the memory that you wish to recall . Then imagine yourself awake in that dream . Don 't tense up . Relax . Only then , you will be able to recall that memory in a dream . I should 've asked , sorry . It may be confusing at first . What you see and all . Just relax and check the time . If the second hand is stopped , you 're in the lucid dream . Min-woo ! Daddy . Your brain is 30 times more active in REM sleep . You might see things you don 't remember . Here 's your hamburger . Wait ! Stop ! Who are you ? I saw a suspicious man . So I chased him , then the dream suddenly ... Did you act differently from before ? Yes . Small changes don 't matter , but if you change the core memory your dream will be crushed and it 'll be dominated by your imagination . If you want to get clues , leave things the way they were . But ... He was a complete stranger who didn 't exist in my memory . He was very conscious of me . And he suddenly vanished . Does he look like this ? - Yes ! That 's him ! - It 's This Man . What ? He does shared dreaming . Other patients have seen him in their dreams too . Anyway , just ignore him . Unless you attack him , he won 't disrupt your dream . Like the second hand , just think it 's a dream if you see him . So-hyun , let 's try it one last time . Here 's your hamburger . Daddy ! Mister ! Can you hear me ? YEON ORPHANAGE It 's not him . Yes . Did you find out anything ? Almost everyone has been contacted by us or Choi . This was reported five years ago . - By reporter Choi ? - Yes . Hi , Chief . There are some names of important figures mentioned here . Even top CEO 's sons . If it 's anyone with a grudge , maybe they hired kidnappers to ... Grab him ! I think we can find Min-woo . I 'm sure this time ! We can find him . Check your watch . You 're in the real world . What did you see ? We see all kinds of things we don 't want to see as cops . What 's this ? A man who had a tattoo like that took Min-woo . I 'm sure we can find the clues this time . If we don 't , I 'll give it all up . We can 't give up . Let 's try it . We have a chance , so we should do whatever we can . Is there any other clue than this tattoo ? So a man with a tattoo on his arm took Min-woo and someone else injured you . There were no prints on the sting that brought me down , right ? Right . Then he must 've been wearing gloves . Daddy ! Shit . Mister ! Are you okay ? Can you hear me ? Can you hear me , sir ? What color do you want ? Find all mug shots that resemble that ! SUSPECT 'S RECORDS ABDUCTION , KIDNAPPING VIOLENT CRIME TEAM ONE Hey , did you eat ? Daddy will visit tonight . Anything you 're craving ? Sweet and sour chicken ? Have you tried that before ? Okay , I 'll bring some . Daddy will call back later . Your daughter ? Yes . You should get some sleep . You didn 't sleep all night . How old is she ? She just turned eight . I saw her picture . She 's very pretty . Well ... Aren 't you hungry ? How about getting breakfast ? Thanks but I have to go somewhere . Where ? SILVER PRIVATE DETECTIVES I have a favor to ask , sir . Is he the bastard who took the little one ? Cops are searching for him , but it 's not easy . You should 've come sooner ! What do cops know ? But how 'd you find him ? - Through lucid dreams ... - I know that ! The nightclub downtown . I heard it 's great there . Anyway ... Hey ! Get your ass over here . That fucking ... - Hey ! - Yes , sir . I told you to wear your hearing aid . Sorry , sir . Get to work on this thing . Thank you , sir . Come on . If it wasn 't for you , I 'd be falsely behind bars . We 're family . No need to thank me . My boys have been finding people for 40 years . We 'll find your boy . Hang in there . If you overdo it , it can cause cerebrovascular problems . CEO Tae-yoon Kim Acquitted If you want to get clues , leave things the way they were . - Sir ? - Yes . Do you remember me ? Who are you ? I lost my son here three years ago . Oh , yes ! The reporter ? What brings you here ? Sir , I have a favor to ask you . Please recall what the tattooed man looks like . One Coke , please . I 'm sorry . That 'll be 1,500 won . Here you go . Damn . Did you see him ? Yes , sort of . He was well-built and had a dark complexion . But his hat was covering his face . That 's pretty much all I saw ... Wait ! The card reader . The credit card reader . He paid by credit card ! Did you contact all the card companies ? - Yes , sir . - Any suspects ? Sun-pyo Yoon , Kyung-hwan Choi , and Yong-ho Kim . Three of them . Let 's check . Sun-pyo Yoon . Shit . Kyung-hwan Choi . Look ! Hold on . Kyung-hwan Choi ! That 's the tattoo ! Hello , Kyung-hwan Choi . Let 's go . Text me the address . Chief ! What ? There 's a problem . He 's been in a coma for two years due to a car accident . I 'm sorry , but the probability of him waking up is near zero . He could die any day now . Investigations are always like this . Like instant lottery tickets . You get your hopes up , then scratch it and it 's nothing . It 's tough , right ? I 'm fine . It 's okay . Let it out . You saw my daughter 's picture before , right ? She tells me ... she loves me . " I love you , Daddy . " But she can 't say that short sentence in one breath . " I love you ... Daddy . " " I love you ... Daddy . " She can barely speak one word at a time . Why is that ? She 's very sick . Ever since she was born . It 's her heart . If I only drank less ... If I quit smoking sooner ... My daughter could 've been born healthy too . It 's not your fault , Chief . I 'm sure she 'll get better soon . Of course . Min-woo ... We 'll find him soon enough . Don 't blame yourself . Let 's hang in there . I will think of Min-woo as my own and I will not ... give up on him . Ouch ! My eyes ! Come here you ! This is mine , too . Daddy ? When are you coming ? I drew this picture of you ! Is this the bastard ? It 's Sang-man Yoo . He 's quite famous around here . But he noticed that we 're on to him . Gimpo International Airport . Twelve o 'clock flight to Tokyo . You 'd better hurry ! Chief ! I found the guy ! Where are you ? Heading to the airport . Okay . Wait till I get there . Move ! Move ! Run , run , run ! Hurry ! Where 's Min-woo ! Tell me ! Tell me , you bastard ! I don 't know anything ! Kyung-hwan Choi did it ! That bastard did everything ! What did he do ? Kyung-hwan Choi ... Tell me now ! What did he do ? Kyung-hwan Choi ... He killed him . I didn 't do anything ! He killed him ? Kyung-hwan Choi ... killed Min-woo ? What are you talking about ? Min-woo 's not dead ! He 's not dead ! Let go ! That bastard 's lying ! Why would Min-woo be dead ? Let go of me ! This must be a dream ! Why would Min-woo die ? Min-woo is not dead . That is not true . My son is not dead . Stay back . Has the suspect been caught ? What was the motive of the crime ? ARRESTED SUSPECT FOR KIDNAPPING IN AMUSEMENT PARK It must 've surfaced from last night 's downpour . Stay back , sir . - What are you doing ? - Stop him ! Don 't let him come in . - It 's not him , right ? - What 's going on ? It 's not Min-woo , right ? Tell me ! Chief ! Tell me ! Chief ! Let me go ! Get the CCTV footages ! I want to know everything Sang-man did since he came in ! - Find out who was on night watch ! - Yes , sir ! Stop ! Move ! How can he commit suicide at the police station ? Sang-man Yoo and Kyung-hwan Choi ! I 've never met them ! It 's a bit early to tell , but I think someone 's behind them . Someone must 've ordered Sang-man and Kyung-hwan to kidnap Min-woo . And he 's scary enough to make Sang-man commit suicide . Let 's wait for the autopsy . I 'm sorry . No . I 'll find him . His body hasn 't been found . My Min-woo ! I know he 's healthy and bravely ... waiting for me . What 's wrong ? Chairman Cho Suspected of Stock Manipulation It 's a side effect from the lucid dreams . It 's nothing serious so far , but if you keep going , it could get dangerous . Take some pills and rest . How do you know Chairman Myung-chul Cho ? The owner of Hanbit Corp ? He 's a psychiatric patient . He 's also my biggest sponsor of lucid dreams . Why 's he getting treated ? His son died in a car accident . He 's getting treated from the shock of it . He 's meeting his dead son like you through lucid dreams . Why do you ask ? I checked out everyone who may have grudges against me . But not him . What do you mean ? Nothing special came out . Ten years ago , do you remember your report on Chairman Cho 's stock manipulation ? But there was no significant damage so he probably wasn 't on your list . Do you remember him ? It 's his oldest son , Min-hyung Cho . You exposed plutocrats sons exemptions from military duty . He was one of them . It was a big blow to him . But he got in a car accident three years ago . He couldn 't get a transfusion and died . His blood type is MkMk . It 's a rare blood type and only about 20 people in Korea have it . What happened ? He fell on the playground yesterday . Come on ! I told you to be careful ! He can 't bleed ! What 's the matter ? Is something wrong ? Min-woo 's blood type is MkMk . Hey ! Stop ! Who are you ? Did you know ? People who have lucid dreams are drawn to each other . We were destined to meet . Cut the crap ! Just explain what 's going on . What do you think ? A dream ? Reality ? Okay , fine . I 'll explain everything so let 's talk without grabbing my collar . Why are you so violent ? You must not have been educated . I went into your dream world . That 's how we met . Ever heard of shared dreaming ? Dream walking , dream invasion ? As you can see , I lost my legs in an accident when I was young . You can imagine how shitty my life was . That 's when I came across lucid dreams . Well ... I can fly and go wherever I want in dreams . It was addictive . But one day , it just got fucking boring . Then I found out about shared dreaming . Basically , it 's hacking into someone else 's dream . Let 's see ... We have unique brainwave frequencies while dreaming . If you match your frequency to someone else 's you can slip inside their dream . It 's a totally fantastic world ! If you do it right ... How 'd you know my frequency ? Well ... I read up on Dr. So-hyun Park . The top expert on lucid dreams ... So I just hacked into her computer . I was just testing it out . I swear ! I didn 't have ... Don 't do it again ! Then , can I go into someone else 's dream too ? Shared dreaming is different from lucid dreams ! It 's not proven at all . If things go wrong , you could die ! Let 's go , Dae-ho . The doctor is pretty and smart . Please , I beg of you . What 's with the politeness ? Look , mister . Lucid dreaming is your dream , which means you can easily get out of it . But the person dreaming is in control in shared dreaming . You can 't get out just by pressing the chime bell . You could get stuck inside their sub-consciousness forever . Unless you 're well-trained like me ... İt is impossible . I can do it . You don 't get it . I 've done this countless times , but you haven 't done it once ! But whose dream are we talking about ? My son 's kidnapper . He 's in a vegetative state now . The only way to meet him ... is in the dream world . Are you out of your mind ? What if he dies during the shared dreaming ? You 'll die too ! If it means finding my son , I 'm not afraid of dying . Please . I beg of you . Damn it . Do I really have to do this ? Do not forget about our deal . Okay ! Connect ! Kyung-hwan probably believes his dream world is the real world . I 'm warning you . If Kyung-hwan dies while you 're inside , there 's no way out for you . You 'll live inside his dream forever . When you press the chime bell , concentrate on moving your brainwaves to separate them from his . And the backgrounds may change , so don 't panic . Understood ? Right . What 's the most important thing ? I 'm not responsible for anything . You signed a memorandum . Now ... get comfortable . Relax . Relax . Now . Think of a door at the end of a long , empty tunnel . Open it and walk in slowly . Stop it ! Ready ? Look ! FOG AREA Kyung-hwan Choi ? Plate number 51GA 3458 . Just do it , fucker ! I don 't think this is right . We just do what we 're told . But the boy will die ! If I knew , I wouldn 't have agreed to it . Why do you care if the kid dies or not ? My wife just had a miscarriage . I can 't do this , bro . Let 's not be animals . Want to go back behind bars ? We just do what we 're told and get paid . If we mess up , we 're dead ! Even your wife ! Got it ? Dickhead . Let go ! STUDENT RECORDS MIN-WOO CHOI " Min-woo Choi , 95 % " ? " Gwang-yun Shin , Dong-su Kang , Seo-hyung Min , Jae-hoon Park ... " " Min-hyung Cho " ?

How did you find out about this place ? Answer me , you son of a bitch ! Hello ? Yes . No , but ... Yes . Yes , sir . Hey ! Too bad . I got orders to kill you . We were going to kidnap your son tomorrow . It 's so weird that you came here . Now what ? You have to die . Right ? Are you really going to kill him ? Son of a bitch ! Bastard ! Die ! Bastard ! Stop interrupting ! Die ! Asshole ! I knew this would happen ! Do something ! See you . Your son will join you soon . What the fuck ? Are you okay ? If it wasn 't for me , you 'd be dead ! Don 't even think about doing this again ! Gwang-yun Shin . Sang-joon Ahn . Min-hyung Cho . These people have MkMk blood . Chairman Cho 's son , Min-hyung , was in an accident three years ago . Min-hyung Cho ? I saw him in one of your articles . He needed a transfusion for surgery . His father made that list to find those people . You mean Chairman Cho kidnapped Min-woo for his blood ? It 's quite possible . Where 'd you get this list ? Through shared dreaming . Shared dreaming ? It 's using brainwaves to enter someone else 's dream . I met someone who can do it . So I went into Kyung-hwan Choi 's dream . You went inside his dream ? You met Kyung-hwan Choi there ? But I can 't go to Chairman Cho without a warrant . You know my style . What do you mean ? I 'll go myself . Reporter Choi ! Chairman Cho rides with his secretary and chief guard . Then a car with more guards follows behind them . On average , four or five of guards are surrounding him at all times . Except for when he sleeps and poops , he 's never alone . There must be a way . He 's not an easy match . But we 'll find a way . Can you check on this plate ? Plate number 51GA 3458 ? A black Azera ? And please dig up everything on Kyung-hwan Choi and Sang-man Yoo . Of course . It 'll be a piece of cake . Hang in there . Okay ? Chairman Cho must be alone some time . Sorry , So-hyun . He 'll wake up in five minutes . Be careful . What the hell happened ? - He 's not here ! - Are you okay , Doctor ? Hey ! Run ! Hurry ! He 's right there ! Stop right there ! Get him ! Go up ! Stop ! - Call the others right away ! - Okay . Sorry to bother you when you 're all busy . Have a drink . It 's on me . I have a question . I heard this car was sold here . It 's a black Azera , 51GA 3458 . Sir , we can 't disclose private information . Then you motherfuckers should 've said it before drinking that ! Spit it out , you son of a bitch ! What 's with you , sir ? I 'll gouge your eyes out ! This was my car . But some fucker stole it and sold it here . You get what I mean ? Where 's Min-woo ! Tell me ! You made this list ! I don 't know anything ! Tell me or there 's no telling what I will do ! My guards will find me soon . I 'll let you off if you drop this now ! You son of a bitch ! Are you crazy ? I 'll ask one last time ! Where 's Min-woo ? One , two , three ! I 'll talk ! I 'll talk . A few years ago my son got in a bad accident . He needed a blood transfusion . I found a research center on unique blood types . I bought that list off them . That 's all ! Stop lying ! You took Min-woo for a blood transfusion ! - Chairman Cho ! - Sir ! You bastard ! Sir ! Let go ! Damn it ! Chairman Cho 's Oldest Son Dead From a Car Accident Where 's Min-woo ? I told you I don 't know him . Your son was kidnapped on April 21st , 2012 . Min-hyung died in February . Can 't you see that ? You 're famous for exposing corporate corruptions . You exposed my son too . Just because I got him exempted from the military , you ruined him . You must know . When your son 's gone , you regret not having done more for him . Then who else has the list ? Why ... should I tell you that ? You tried to kill me . I 'm sorry , sir ! I 'm a dumb bastard who didn 't know better ! Please forgive me . What are you doing ? For the last three years ... every day was so painful . Life was ... a living hell . If you help me this once ... I 'll do anything . I 'll die if you tell me to ! Please forgive me , sir . Please , sir ! Tell me anything you know ! Hey . Don 't be so quick to say you 'll die . Fine . Jump off from here . If you survive , I 'll tell you what you want . Why ? Scared ? A dumb bastard who didn 't know better ... Hey , crazy bastard ! I started contacting the people on the list . But my son soon died . Then someone broke into my office . They took the list from my computer . It must be someone who needed the list . Someone must 've needed the blood like me . Or maybe even an organ . An organ ? If the list has to do with Min-woo , the culprit must be on it too . " Seo-hyung Min , Mi-rim Jung ... " " Su-Jin Song " ? " Seyeon Hospital . " SU-JIN SONG Is this ... Su-Jin ? Yes . May I help you ? Hello ? Where are you ? I don 't believe this . Listen to me carefully and don 't freak out . Why do you think there were no clues for three years ? How did Sang-man Yoo know he had to run off to Tokyo ? And why 'd he die at the police station ? What 's wrong ... with Su-Jin ? Her heart . What are you doing ? She 's very sick . Ever since she was born . I will think of Min-woo as my own and I will not ... give up on him . Chief Song ! He was the car owner ! He 's the one who arrested Sang-man Yoo and Kyung-hwan Choi . He told them to kidnap Min-woo in exchange for releasing them . He graduated from Korean National Police University . He deliberately took on your case because he 's the culprit ! I 'll meet you at your office and ... Hello ? Hello ? Reporter Choi ! Do you think it 's unfair ? How could you ? Why ? I 'm trying to save my daughter . I thought that you of all people would understand me . Want to know another secret ? Your son is alive . Where 's my son , you bastard ? Relax . I don 't know where he is either . Only Kyung-hwan Choi knows where Min-woo is . Sang-man called after the kidnapping . Where the hell is he ? He took off with Min-woo . Kyung-hwan Choi ruined everything I planned . That bastard ! I scoured the country looking for him . Then I found him in hiding about two years ago . Bastard ! But he became a vegetable from that accident . After that ... there was nothing I could do . I couldn 't find a heart for Su-Jin . I couldn 't find your son . But ... do you know why I 'm telling you this ? Thanks to you , I found a way to meet that fucking bastard . Shared dreaming . You gave me my last hope . I 'll promise you this . When I find Min-woo , I 'll tell him you loved him . No ! Let him be in peace . No , no . No ! Sir ! I lost the signal . What ? Fuck . Are they on to us ? - Let 's scatter out and find him . - Yes , sir ! What 's that ? Boys ! Over here ! What in the world ! Reporter Choi ! What the fuck ! Son of a bitch ! You 're dead ! You little piece of shit ! Take that ! - Boss ! Boss ! - Boss ! Are you okay ? Over there ! Get over there ! Su-Jin is not doing so good . She 's been comatose for days . We should prepare for the worst . Su-Jin ... I can find that boy now . Su-Jin ... Hold on a bit longer . After the transplant , let 's go to an amusement park . Let 's see the animals ... you love . And eat yummy food . Hold on , Su-Jin . You can do it , right ? Are you okay ? Of course , I 'm fine . Don 't worry . But you don 't look so good . Sir ... My son is alive . Hey , I told you so . I told you we 'd find your boy . Don 't worry about me . - Boys ? - Yes ? Give him a phone and car key . Go on ! Hurry ! Now ! Go on . I heard someone can do shared dreaming . So-hyun , it 's me ! Where are you ? I called many times . I found out Min-woo is alive . What ? Chief Song ! He 's the culprit ! Kyung-hwan knows where Min-woo is . Yong-hyun has to get me back inside his dream ! Chief Song was just here for his address . Don 't go ! It 's dangerous ! We have to find Min-woo before Chief Song ! I 'll try it . I know Kyung-hwan 's brainwave frequency . And Yong-hyun explained it to me the other day . I haven 't tried it yet , but let 's give it a shot . Are you Yong-hyun Kwon ? Who 's asking ? I must get inside Kyung-hwan Choi 's dream . What ? I 'm done with that ... - What the ... - Shut up and get ready now ! - Which room ? - It 's 704 . Harder ! It worked ! One hundred fifty joules ! Charge ! Clear ! One , two ... Freeze or you die . Where is the boy ? Tell me , bastard ! Where 's the kid ? Tell me . Do you know how much I prayed every day to find you ? Seeing the boy 's eyes ... I couldn 't kill him . That boy can 't die , but my daughter can ? Do you think you can find your son ? You won 't have your way ! Kyung-hwan Choi ! What 's happening ? Kyung-hwan Choi must be critically ill . His brainwaves aren 't stable . So is that ... dangerous ? Well , if he dies , he couldn 't get worse . Son of a ... Don 't you dare touch me ! If I press this button , he 'll be trapped inside forever . Focus , Kyung-hwan ! Focus ! Where is my son ? Listen to me . We 're inside your dream . You 've been comatose for two years since the accident . So I came into your dream . What about Chief Song ? Why is there two of him ? He came into your dream too . One already existed in your dream . The other came in from reality like me . We don 't have much time . If you die , I can 't find my son . I didn 't want him to die . I had no idea they 'd kill him . Honestly . I don 't resent you . So please tell me . I have to find Min-woo . I ran away with him that night . I took him to a Catholic church on an island and said he was an orphan . I left him there . Min-woo must think you 're dead by now . I 'm so sorry . Namhae Catholic Church Sorry , pal . But ... I have to save my daughter no matter what . Su-Jin ... Daddy 's so sorry . Min-woo . I 'll never give up on you ! When you press the chime bell , concentrate on moving your brainwaves . Are you Min-woo 's father ? Yes . NAMHAE CATHOLIC CHURCH Peter ? Remember your father ? It 's okay . Go on . Go on . Hi , Daddy . Hello , son . I 'm so sorry , Min-woo . Daddy 's late . Your beard is gone .

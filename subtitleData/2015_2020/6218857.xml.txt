 Barbie : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits ... ( screams ) go ! ... Pitting us against one another . Chester 's mill sentences dale barbara to death . ... And forcing each of us To confront our own personal demons- - Rage ... I need to know that you will stand with me against that ! ... Grief ... Joe : I don 't understand who could do this to her ? I promise you , we 're going to catch whoever did this . ... Fear ... We 're trapped . Woman : I hear we 're going to run out of water . ( clamoring ) ( screaming ) You killed angle mcalister . ... Shame . I thought it would bring the dome down . I would do anything to take it back . But we 've also found love under the dome . ( muffled explosion ) And we have battled to keep our town together . I thought the dome was supposed to protect us . No , it 's up to us to protect each other . Now we may finally have found a way out . We hope it takes us home , But what if it takes us to an alternate reality ? Follow me . We 're going home . What do you mean , going home ? It 's time to move on . Melanie . Barbie . We can 't leave julia . Julia said it was up to me To lead everybody out . So you 're just gonna leave her here ? She knows that i 'm coming back for her . Look , it 's like she says . Sometimes you just got to take a leap of faith . Into nothingness .

Hey , where 's melanie ? I don 't know . I-i didn 't see her . Did you hear her voice ? ( high-pitched tone sounding ) ( people groaning ) Man : What is that ? ( low murmuring ) We 're outside the dome . Woman : Look . Man : Do you see that ? Man 2 : It 's changing . Woman : It 's ... It 's going up . Man 3 : Where 's it going ? Man 2 : It 's changing . Man : What is it ? Woman : I can 't tell . Man : Take my hand .

Got a drone over the location , No activity in the surrounding area . ( quietly ) : All right , on me . Everybody remember we 're running a standard exfil protocol . Intel has those hostages guarded by a small group Of insurgents . All right , that door 's our entrance point . That 's where they 're holding ' em . ( explosion ) There 's no one here ! Target 's a ghost ! Yeah , i got Ten hostiles coming your way- - they came out of nowhere . ( gunfire ) ( grunting ) You 're good . Catch your breath . Hunter , Talk to me ! Rooftops are clean .

( continues indistinctly ) Like steven seagal in his aptly-titled 1990 classic , You are hard to kill . Oh , trust me , it ain 't from lack of trying . I 'm glad you 're back safe . Drink later ? No , man , i 'm beat . Another time ? Yeah . Hey , I don 't know how to thank you . Ah , just doing what you hired me to do . Yeah , well , hiring you might be the only good decision I 've made as operations manager here . Ah , it 's a tough job , trying to make the world a safer place . You know , my part 's easy . Just stop the bad guys from making your job harder . Occupational hazard . I 'm gonna go get cleaned up . ♪ ♪ You want to talk about it ? Talk about what ?

Barbie 's not coming back for us . He will . You 'll see . You heard that rumbling . Maybe the tunnels caved in on them . Maybe everyone 's ... Shut up . I don 't want to hear it . We need to get across , find out where they are . They can 't be far- - they were just in front of us . If something 's wrong , we 'll help them . All right . How ? ( grunting ) We can get a ladder at the school . Pick up some flashlights . What is it ? My father . Jim 's not the priority right now . We need to get the supplies and get back here , fast . Great . Flares ? Just in case . In case we get lost at sea ? ( sighs ) let 's go . ( slide racks ) Cat get stuck up in a tree ? Should 've killed me while you had a chance , junior . Jim , you 've got to let us go . Oh , yeah ? Why 's that ? You got a hair appointment ? ( chuckles ) Them roots are looking a little tired . ( scoffs ) will you just let us go ? If you were gonna kill us , you would 've done it already . Kill you ? Who said anything about killing you ? We are the only ones left . I may need you . For repopulation . Why 'd you need the ladder ? I said , " why did you need the ladder ? " Okay . I got nothing but time . ( chuckles ) It 's like that old twilight zone episode . Remember ? With , uh , rocky 's manager . The penguin . Wh-what 's his name ? Um , uh , meredith . Yeah . And he-he 's all alone after the apocalypse , And all he wants to do is read . ( chuckles ) And then he breaks his glasses . ( faked sobbing ) I mean , talk about a tragedy . We need the ladder to get across a rift in the tunnels . That 's where everyone went . We need to get across and find them . Find barbie . ( laughing ) You still believe , don 't you ? That the dome is good , that ... That it 's here to protect us . If you still believe that , then you 're even dumber Than the bag of hair i took you for . The dome is here to destroy us . It killed them all . Barbie , all of them- - They 're all dead . No . You 're wrong . He 's alive . Cut him loose . Go on . You 're gonna end up dead as the rest of ' em . This is my town now . What 's left of it . And that 's the last bit of charity you 're gonna get . If by some miracle you make it out alive , You best stay well clear of me .

Never would have happened If i hadn 't got sent here a year ago . Strange to say it , but this place has been good for me . This lawyer ... Got in touch with me recently . He told me there had been some kind of screw-up In the chain of custody With the evidence related to my case . He told me That if we appeal , It 's possible we could get a new trial . I could be a free man . But ... I have to make amends for what i 've done . That 's the step i got to focus on . Making amends ... To those i 've wronged . And then ... Maybe i can move on .

You did a terrible thing , sam , But that one terrible thing doesn 't have to define you . The lawyer that i sent to you- - He told me that you wouldn 't appeal your case . Why ? Because i deserve to be here . You were an emt before , yes ? Well , from my experience , no one goes into that line of work Who doesn 't have a deep desire To help people , heal people . If you appealed , and you were released , Think of all the people that you could affect . You know the memorial 's today . Of course . If you 'd spoken to the lawyer , He might have been able to arrange a short furlough . I 'd never be welcome there . Maybe you could write something . Something i could read later . Then at least you 'd be a part of the memorial . Perhaps it might help you make amends . I need to speak to joe . And you will . But joe has to be ready to hear you , and ...

( panting ) A year ago , the people of this town Were delivered from the dome . But some of you , many of you , also suffered a great loss . Of friends . Of family . After a shared tragedy , There 's nothing that provides more consolation Than a sense of community . Those lives will never be forgotten , And their memory will be preserved in an eternal flame Here at the monument . A memorial is About moving forward , Moving on , together . To that effect , i 'd like to read A brief epigraph from someone who couldn 't be here today . " make a way in the wilderness , " and do not remember the former things " or consider the things of old . " for when you walk through fire , " you shall not be burned , And the flame shall not consume you . " Is there anyone who would care to speak first ? Uh , i wasn 't planning on saying anything today , But a lot of you knew my sister , Angie mcalister . Some of you knew her as a waitress at the sweetbriar . Some of you knew her as a volunteer down at the clinic . Me ... I just always knew her . And she was so full of life , you know ? ( sighs ) It 's hard to accept that ... That she 's gone , To say good-bye , To lose someone that you love the most . And it 's hard to move on , but ... I 'm trying . ( quietly ) : I don 't know what to ... Joe here , He was one of the first people that i met When i came to chester 's mill . I was a stranger to him , to all of you . He made me feel Like i belonged . First time i felt that in a long time . The people of chester 's mill Opened their hearts to me . And that , i think , allowed me to open mine . Especially to a woman named julia shumway . What can i say about julia ? She was the bravest woman i ever met . She was endlessly curious . She was , quite possibly , The most stubborn individual to walk this earth In its four billion or so years . She was loyal . She always had your back . Always rooting for the underdog . And she couldn 't help it . She just ... She never lost her faith In the basic goodness of humanity . Like christine here said , Even though julia And-and many of your own loved ones are gone ... They 'll never be forgotten . ( gasping ) i think it 's important to learn that we can both remember And move on At the same time . ( gasping ) Ben ! Somebody help him ! Ben !

Not judging . Ben : Chester 's mill cop . Chester 's mill groundkeeper . Chester 's mill delivery guy . Different hair , different clothes . Moustache , no moustache . But here 's where it gets weird . They 're all the same freaking face . Barbie , i 'm telling you they 're all the same dude . Whatever 's going down in chester 's mill , Here 's proof that it ain 't real . What did he mean " not real " ? Plug this in . I want you to play it again . Punch in on their faces . No prob .

Okay , so then fix it . I 'm trying ! I ... This makes no sen ... I ... Okay , i need you to do whatever it takes to retrieve that file . Do you understand me ? Hey ! Do you understand me ? Yeah . Meet me at the 'briar in an hour . Ben was such a good friend . I can 't believe he 's dead . Chester 's mill strikes again . ( sighs ) It doesn 't make any sense . What ? Go to college And gain , like , 15 pounds . It helps keep the weight off . You 're so gonna love it there . Who says i 'm even going ? Wow . It 's like you 're trapped under a dome and you can 't even see it . Joe , This isn 't what angle would 've wanted . She was my sister ... Yeah , and she 's dead ! Just like my mom . And it sucks and it 's unfair . But that doesn 't mean you stop living . Leaving chester 's mill is the best thing i ever did . It allowed me to heal and to meet new people . I feel like a different person and i want that for you , too . You 're different , all right . The clothes , the hair . A sorority ? Seriously ? It 's nice to be a part of something bigger than yourself . To belong . Is that why you haven 't been back here in over a year ? You 're too busy belonging ? We decided that we would take a break Until you graduate , joe . It was great catching up with you , norrie . Joe . Damn it . ( sighs ) ( shower running ) Eva ? Check-out 's at noon , slowpoke . You haven 't even packed . Yeah , i wanted to talk to you about that . Everything okay ? You think it 'd be all right if we stayed another day ? With everything that happened with ben And the memorial , I think we should stick around . Everyone was pretty shaken up . Yeah , you were pretty shaken up . You were tossing and turning all night . No , i-i 'm fine . Well , if you 're fine Care to , uh , Join me in the shower ? Hmm ? ( chuckles ) ( moans ) I can 't . I 'm sorry , i got to ... Go ? Yeah . Love you . ( door closes ) ( groaning ) Inmate : You got something to say , Why don 't you say it to my face , man ? ! Come on . ( grunts ) ( grunting ) ( inmates shouting ) Oh , bring it ! ( inmates shouting ) Fine , he stabs you . One of yours stabs him And so on and so on Until there 's none of you left . You want vengeance , You better dig two graves . One for him and one for you . Who 's gonna dig yours , huh ? I 've tried everything i know . Ben 's video isn 't on his phone or on the cloud . It 's like it ... Was never there ? You 're not gonna , like , fire me , right ? I just got a condo . Those men on the video , They can 't all be the same guy . That is ... It 's crazy . ( sighs ) Ship that off to billingsley , all right ? I 'm gonna go ahead and call in a few favors While we 're at , uh ... Excuse ... Junior ? Hey , barbie . You 're dead . Not the last time i checked . Hunter : Yo ! Incoming . What are you doing here ? I know , i feel bad that i missed the memorial , But my bike broke down . We haven 't seen you since ... Marrakech ? You were building homes For the poor . Yeah . How weird was it That we ran into each other in africa , Of all places ? Uh , you still seeing that hottie that drank us under the table ? Uh , what was her name ? Uh , eva . Yeah , she 's actually here with me in chester 's mill . Yeah , yeah , i 'd love to see her . You know , minus the crap tequila . ( chuckles ) well , i 'm not sure how long we 'll be here in town . No worries . I know it must be rough for you being back here . I think about julia all the time . Yeah , me , too . Just glad you were able to move on . If anyone deserves happiness , it 's you . I appreciate that . Hey , i 'm gonna let you two catch up . I got to go check on something , But it 's good seeing you , junior . You , too , man . Do you really think this will work ? When barbie used the dome like this to write me a message , He was taken away by armed men . They were watching us . My father 's men ? ( sighs ) let 's hope they 're still watching . Don : She needs the egg . Let me take the egg back to chester 's mill . I-i think that the dome may very well Be its power source . You know , 25 years ago , A meteor storm bombarded the earth . A year after that , The first fragments of one of these so-called eggs Was found in a meteor near our drilling site in alaska . With the government 's blessing , I 've devoted the resources of this company To track down ever meteor that fell that night . This was the only egg that was found intact . So you can imagine my reluctance To letting it leave this facility . If the egg isn 't returned , We risk losing everyone inside . Eh , i don 't give a damn about anyone in chester 's mill . Uh , no offense to your daughter . Your son is trapped under the dome as well , no ? That 's not relevant . No , no , no , no , i-i disagree . If i allow you to take this egg back to chester 's mill , It 's a one-way ticket . I need to know that you 're doing this For the good of the company , And not for some sentimental reason . We want the same thing . To unlock and harvest the power of the egg And the secrets it holds , Regardless of costs . You think my father got my message ? I have to believe he did . And this is where he 'll surface from zenith . What was it like in the cocoons ? Being asleep . What is it ? If my father returns with the egg , What do i even say to him ? It 's been so long . You don 't have to say anything . He 's your father . ( sighs ) ( groans ) Are you okay ? ( groans ) Yeah , i would be , If the world would stop spinning . ( chuckles ) you need to rest , Conserve your strength . I can take the first watch . No . No , julia . Lay down . You 've always taken such good care of me . Always trusted me . Let me do this one small thing for you . I 'll wake you at the first sign of my father . ( groans ) Eagle one ? How should we proceed ? Just hold off until the team has arrived . Also , establish a permanent comm link Once you 're inside the dome . ( splashing , don gasping ) ( groans ) ( panting ) Melanie ? I can 't believe it 's really you . Did you bring it ? Is that the egg ? Of course , sweetheart . You know i 'd do anything for you . You 're my daughter . But i 'm not . ( choking ) ( choking stops ) Eva : Dale ? I got your text . Why are we here ? How did we meet ? Are you serious ? Eva , please , This is important . How did we meet ? It was at that dive bar in marrakech . Your tall friend kept buying me drinks , But all i could look at was you . His name ? What was his name ? I think it was james ? But you and hunter kept calling him junior . Babe , what is this about ? Okay , this is gonna sound crazy , All right , but i need you to believe me here . His name was james rennie , And his name was on this wall yesterday . That 's not possible . Everything is just jumbled up in my head . You and me , Marrakech , kabul , The bed-and-breakfast in belgrade . But now , I 've got all these other memories , too . I saw junior 's body , okay ? He died that day along with his father and julia The day that dome came down . Okay . I 'm so sorry . This is my fault . I thought coming back to chester 's mill Would be good for you , for us , But i can see now that it 's just upsetting you . No , you-you , but you 're not listening to me . It 's more than that . It 's the-the-these places , These people , something is wrong here . It 's not making sense . What ? Dale ? Hey , you . Hey ! ( grunting ) ( gasps ) i beg you ! ( gun clicks ) No , i killed you . What are you , watching me ? ! Huh ? ! Dale , let him go ! What are you doing ? You don 't understand . I ... No . Don 't do this ! He was in the video , okay ? That 's what ben wanted to show me . Then the video disappeared . Ben told me before he died That he felt like someone was watching him , okay ? That-that all of this was not real . Okay , sweetie , you 're scaring me . Just take my hand . You 've been under so much stress . We can ... We can go back to the motel , Or we can get in the car and drive away . We never have to come back here again . I-i can 't , okay ? Not until i figure out what 's going on here . Dale ! Focus on your breathing . Focus on just being . Let your thoughts flow through you Until there are none . Eyes . How do you ... ? Because i 'm focused , and you 're not . Again . Breathe . ( exhales ) This is stupid . I take it you spoke with norrie ? I 'm so pissed at her . Life becomes so much easier when you learn To accept the apology you never got . You can 't expect her to be sorry for being happy . She said i was still trapped under a dome because of angie . Am i ? Let me ask you something . You have always dreamed of being an engineer , A builder , an inventor , so , why do you think You haven 't been able to send in your acceptance letter To cal tech , a place to accomplish all your goals ? It just ... Doesn 't feel right . Joe , i can 't tell you how to feel . But ... If you really want to know Whether you 're still living under a dome , Maybe it 's time you Forgive the person who put you there ? No . No way . You have kept your feelings Regarding sam buried for so long , They 're like a chain weighing you down . I don 't want them to stop you From reaching your true potential . I have nothing to say to sam verdreaux . Then just listen . He 's as much A prisoner of the past as you are . The difference is , You 're the one holding all the keys . ( tool ratcheting ) Nice ride . Thanks . And you are ... ? Christine . Christine price . Uh , better not . I heard you were back in town . Who from ? Your friend hunter . All it takes is a free latte , And you 'd be amazed what people tell you . You the town shrink ? Uh , well , i prefer therapist , But , yes , i help places like chester 's mill heal After a natural disaster . Yeah , there was nothing natural about the dome . Well , unnatural disaster just sounds a little too fox news . It 's a shame we didn 't get to meet last year . By the time i was assigned to here , You were just ... Gone . Nothing to keep me here . We missed you at the memorial yesterday . Yeah , i had some trouble with my bike . That 's kind of convenient , Don 't you think ? Showing up the day after a tribute To everyone the town lost , Including your father ? Town didn 't lose my father . I killed him to protect it . So if the reason you 're here is To see how i 'm doing since the dome came down , Ridding myself of my father was the best thing i 've ever done . Now , if you don 't mind ... I 'm just curious . If ridding yourself Of your father is the best thing you 've ever done , Why haven 't you sold his house ? Lady , why do you even care ? Because like it or not , james rennie , you belong here . You 're part of this town . You 're part of a community that needs you right now . I can never be part of this town . My father made sure of that . You want to know why i left ? 'cause everyone around here thinks i 'm just like him . Then , maybe , it 's time you stop running away And show them that you 're not . ( grunts ) ( dog barking nearby ) ( barking ) ( barking ) Big jim : Wakey , wakey , sleeping beauty . ( laughing ) Tell me who the hell that is ? I asked ... Don barbara . That 's barbie 's old man ? How 'd he get in chester 's mill ? Maybe he would 've told you if you hadn 't have killed him . ( scoffs ) you think i did this ? Wouldn 't be the first innocent person you 've killed . Well , i 'll give it to you . You got a pair on you , throwing around accusations , Considering i 'm the one holding the gun . Where is melanie , and where 's the egg ? Or did you kill her , too ? The egg ? I got rid of that damn thing . Don was bringing it back to chester 's mill . What , are you insane ? After everything that egg has done , You wanted him to bring it back here ? That thing is evil . No , evil is shooting your own son . Well , he shot me first . Jim , Everyone in this town is trapped in the tunnels under the dome , Including your son . Junior 's trapped ? So , if you don 't have melanie , and you don 't have the egg , Then get out of my way ! Listen , if you 're such a great reporter , shumway , Answer me this . Why would i kill this guy , Then bring you over to show you the body , huh ? Face it- - you got played . Melanie killed that guy , then left you behind So she could take that egg and do god knows what . Melanie would never betray me . She 's not like you . Well , that 's kind of my point . She 's not like any of us . Nobody gets to come back from the dead . You 're wrong about her . How many people have to suffer Because you can 't see what 's right in front of you , huh ? That egg , this dome , that girl- - They cost me my wife . Move ! You 're so high and mighty , aren 't you ? I 'm not the only one in this town with blood on his hands . People are dead because of you . Your faith In this dome has made you blind , deaf and dumb . Aah ! That is the second time you have called me dumb , And i wouldn 't do it again .

 Previously on " DARK MATTER " ... So what do we do with this thing now ? Complete the delivery . Get paid , what else ? - Whoever delivered the device could be considered an accessory to mass murder . Who are you ? Chief Inspector Kierken . Galactic Authority . I intend to see each of you face trial . Under the jurisdiction of the Galactic Authority . I will return to claim my throne . There are those in the court who are still loyal to me , but without my memories , I don 't know who to trust . You started without me . Mm . So what 'd you get ? Cleaning supplies for my weapons . There 's nothing more disrespectful than killing an opponent with a dirty blade . What did you pick up ? Oh , you know , girl stuff . Scented creams , ammunition ... Knives . You heard from the others ? Um ... Three , Five , you there ? Yep . How goes ? - The rest of us are done . Ten more minutes ? - Well , we 're on the other side of the station , so ... Let 's say 20 . Hey , kid . Wrap it up . Try the red ones . Yeah ? Yeah , I know . They 're super sour , huh ? Ugh ! My salivary glands are imploding . Mm . I 'll see you in ten . What ? That 'll be one bar . What ? This ain 't a buffet , buddy . Three pieces for a bar . You can take another two , if you like . I don 't like . But I 'm gonna take two , anyway . And I 'll need a bag . Watch where you 're going ! You ran into me , buddy . - You sure about that ? - Yep . Hey ! Well , I guess I 'll go around you , then . Come on . Kid ? Kid . * DARK MATTER * Season 02 Episode 11 " Wish I 'd Spaced You When I Had the Chance " Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala Okay . Red . Do you ever guess wrong ? Eventually . Again . Let 's go . Red or blue ? Neither . Am I that easy to read ? It 's your unpredictability that makes you predictable . She 's about this tall , green hair , you haven 't seen her ? Thanks . Hey , uh , you were with the girl . The one with the green hair . Yeah . They took her . Who did ? Outside . Excuse me ! You sure it was them ? Positive . Two , this is Three . Come in . Nyx , Four , anyone ! Come in ! Do you know who they were or where they went ? Yeah , the Danker brothers . They probably took her back to their cabin do you have a truck ? Right here , but ... You 're driving . They 're dangerous . They got nothing on me . - Want me to prove it to you ? - No . You 're driving . You seem to have settled back in quite nicely . Do I ? Your physiological indicators suggest you 're quite well-rested , certainly more relaxed than my last scanalysis . Last scanalysis ? How often do you run them ? I regularly monitor this ship and its crew for anomalies and potential red flags . For instance , I advise you cut down on your sodium intake and increase your consumption of soluble fiber . Okay . Good to know . I also noticed that the reduction in your stress level has increased your appetite . As a result , your body mass has increased by 2 % . Are you saying I 'm fat ? I 'm saying you 're clearly more at ease . I 've decided not to worry about things I can 't change , like other people 's opinions . You 've been granted full access to the ship and its systems . That would suggest a level of trust and acceptance . Yeah , but they draw the line at giving me free run of a station . Let 's be real . If it wasn 't for two , I wouldn 't be alive , much less on board this ship . Granted , some of the other crew members may take some time to come around . I did betray them . They 're very forgiving . When we first met , I tried to kill you all . Now I 've been accepted as one of the crew . What 's that ? The " Raza " has just intercepted a subspace alarm from the planet 's surface . The station has just enacted silent lockdown procedures and sent a coded transmission to Galactic Authority central . Up there . Who are they ? The Danker brothers . They 're bad news . They get into all sorts of trouble ... Theft , smuggling . What do you suppose they want with a kid ? All due respect , but your friend didn 't look like a kid to me . Two , this is Three . Come in . Four , Nyx , anybody . Come in . Damn it . Look , you may have your reasons for not wanting to go to the authorities , but you can 't take on the Dankers alone . If you 've got friends back at the station , we should go back for them . We don 't have time for that . She 's alone up there and defenseless . Yeah . Yeah . Ooh . I swear I 'll kill you ! I 'll hurt you real bad ! What 're you gonna do , huh ? Spoon me to death ? Stop ! Don 't damage the merchandise ! Don 't blame you , kid . If I was going where you 're headed , I 'd probably want to stab someone too . Guess I got to up the dosage . How many of them are there ? Five in all , but they do a lot of hunting , so chances are they 're not all there . Okay , I 'm gonna need you to wait for us . You go in there , you 're not coming back . Sit tight . I 'll be back . Hey . Sit ! Man . We 've received unconfirmed reports that the crew of the " Raza " has been seen on this facility . Consider them armed and extremely dangerous . And remember ... I want them alive . Now let 's go get them . Ready . Red . - No ! - Blue . You sure ? Yes . Blue . Ah ! How ... Now I 'm just predicting your predictive patterns . Three , Five , come in . Three , Five , are you there ? Over . Don 't bother . Comms are down station-wide . Is it a system glitch ? Silent security protocol . Station 's under lockdown . Something 's up . But don 't worry about it . The GA 's on their way . It 's time to go . This is Three . Anyone out there ? Market 's this way . Kill those . They 're Clones . That would explain how they got here so fast . We need to get back to the " Marauder . " Not without the others . If the GA secure the " Marauder " before we do , it won 't matter . We 'll all be trapped on this planet . Casto Capari . That 's who she goes to . No , not Casto . Why not ? Because a healthy girl like her , she 'd fetch a far better price on Stropa-3 . We 'll cut out the middleman . We 'll rent her out to the miners . When they 're done with her , we 'll sell her organs to the harvesters , her flesh to the meat traders , and I want whatever 's left over . I 'm gonna make a jacket out of her skin . I am gonna stuff and mount her face and put it on the wall . You son of a bitch ! Ah ! Hey . Kid . Come on , wake up . - Wake up - what ... You okay ? Hey . Oh . Dizzy . Yeah . Yeah . Take a minute . Everything 's all right . There were these men , they ... Took care of ' em . Cleaning lady 's gonna have a fit , huh ? Where are the others ? Back at the station . This is Three , come in . Is anybody receiving ? You have your comm , kid ? Uh ... No , I must 've lost it . The station 's under lockdown . No one gets in or out . Clear this area . Clear this area now ! Move . Come on , go , go . Move ! Lower your weapons and stand aside . Stop . What 're you looking for ? These . You okay to walk down to the truck ? Yeah , I think so . Whoa . Whoa . Hey . I 'm still kind of dizzy . All right . It 's no problem . Just wait here . I 'll bring the truck around . - Hey . - Yeah ? Thanks for coming to get me . I was scared . Me too . Kind of . Just relax . I 'll have you back at the " Raza " in no time . The Galactic Authority is at the station . What ? How is that possible ? Predominance by proxy . They used transfer transit . Apparently , they 've encountered some resistance and suffered losses . What about our crew ? They eluded escape and are still at large . We still have the transfer pods we used to break into Reynaud 's Facility . Could you use one of them to get me down on that station ? Of course . All right . Then let 's do it . I 'm sorry , six . I 'm afraid I can 't help you . Are you serious ? What , you don 't trust me , either ? My trust in you is irrelevant . I 'm under strict orders not to allow you off this ship . All right , technically , I 'd still be on the ship . My Clone would be down in the station . I believe you 're Sincere in your desire to make amends and that you harbor no ill intent toward the crew . Thanks . Of course , my assumptions are sometimes fallible , so I 've identified a weakness in your left ventricular free wall that I will target if my faith in you proves to be misplaced . Good to know . Yes . It is good to know . - What is it ? - The " Marauder . " It 's on its way back . Ugh ! Shit . Shit , shit . Check my back . Do you see an exit wound ? Uh , yeah , yeah , I see one good . Good , we 're not gonna have to root around for a bullet . I 'm bleeding out . I need you to cauterize the wound . Kid ! I need you to help me . Okay , okay , what do you want me to do ? Stop the bleeding . I need you to find something to seal the wound . Okay . Okay . Okay , I 'm gonna disinfect the wound . Good , good . Come on . Okay . Ah , Jesus ! Disinfect it ! Don 't get it drunk ! Ugh . Oh , man . Okay . Ready ? - Yeah . - Okay . You recognize them ? Yeah , they were here a couple hours ago . Sold ' em some fruit . Did you talk to them ? Argued some with the guy . He was a jerk . Anything else ? No . He got into it with one of the locals and he left . What do you mean by " got into it " ? Nothing major , just a stare down . Boys being boys , right ? Do you know the name of this local ? Uh , Temal Danker . He was in here with his brother . Probably good and gone by now . Hey , you guys discussing the Dankers ? I 've been monitoring all surface communication . Your escape has been noted . Latest reports have the GA in pursuit of two Fugitives . Their present whereabouts are unknown . All right , so they 've managed to evade capture . But for how long ? We 'd be better off if they did get caught . Think about it . At least if they 're in custody , we 'd know where they were , make it easier to retrieve them . True . With all non-official channels down within a 20-mile radius of the station , we are effectively ... Blind . We can 't just sit here waiting . We have to do something . Getting back onto that station is gonna be tough . They 've got all entrances and exits covered . Then let 's make a new one with the " Marauder . " Because I guarantee you the nearest GA ship is already en route to lend backup and take possession of any prisoners . We need to get our people back aboard this ship before they get here . So what 's it gonna be ? The android 's identified the station 's Command and Communication Center . We 'll target it going in , take down their defenses , then breach and access . Hopefully create enough commotion to draw out Three and Five . You think they 'll know it 's us ? Explosions , shooting , and screaming . Who else would it be ? I 'm assuming I don 't need to ask permission to tag along . I was gonna ask you if you wanted to drive . - " Marauder , " are you there ? Go ahead . - An assault on the station won 't be necessary . Five and Three have reportedly escaped containment . The GA has pursued them to a local rural dwelling . I 'm sending you the coordinates . All right , copy that . Easy . - How you feeling ? - Mobile ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'll be right back . Whoa , not so fast . What , you don 't expect me to walk all the way back to get help . Nope , because I 'm driving . You can barely move . - Ugh . - I 'm fine . You don 't sound fine . And you look terrible . You 're all sweaty and pale . More than usual , anyway . I 'll be fine . It 's nothing that a little rr and Three shots of plasma won 't fix . All right . Good to go . All right , turn around . Check that vehicle . Well ... There goes our ride . Sidearm . Single shot . He was the last man killed . Before that ... He catches them by surprise . Boone or the girl . And one of them was wounded by ... The man with the gun . Close range exchange . They were both surprised . Dead man goes down . Boone gets shot . And we just missed them . How do you know ? The only reason they didn 't take the truck is because we beat them to it . They 'll travel north , northwest , put as much distance as they can between us , then circle back around to the station . Inform our people . Have the vehicles flank them on the roadway . We 're going after them . - Hey . - Yeah ? Hey , we should stop . You tired ? No , I 'm worried about you . I 'm fine . Yes , yes , I ... I 'm tired . I need to stop , okay ? Okay . I don 't think you can make it . Oh , thanks for the words of encouragement . Should I shoot myself now or do you want to do the honors ? I mean make it back to the station . Oh . I 'm okay . No , you 're not . You 're hurt . You 're bleeding again , and you 're slowing down . - I should go find some help . - No ! No . I wish you would stop underestimating me . Kid . I stopped underestimating you when you snuck into my quarters and you stole the bullets from my gun . There 's a difference between underestimating someone and not wanting them to get hurt . Damn it . You could always give me the gun . 'Fraid not . You 're better off getting caught than shot . Me , on the other hand ... Little late for that . I don 't see anyone . Oh , they 're coming . How can you be so sure ? 'Cause I recognized their leader . His name 's Kierken . He 's one determined son of a bitch . Four spent some time with him during the tunnel collapse when we were going after corso . What 's he doing here ? What do you think he 's doing here ? It 's not coincidence . He 's after us . Probably has been since we escaped from prison . Followed us to the station , followed us to that cabin . Now he 's following us through these woods . He 's not gonna stop until he has us . Okay , we need to go . Now . Come on . Yeah . Yeah , okay . - Five bodies have been discovered in and around the target site . Three and Five are still reported to be on the run . The GA is in pursuit . Copy that . Run a scan for heat signatures . Nothing . I 'm not picking up anything . They 're jamming up all electronics and surveillance as well . We 're gonna have to rely on visual sightings . Take us in for a closer look . Hey . Hey , come on . Get up . Let 's go . I can 't . Get up . There 's a change of plans . We 're gonna split up , okay ? No , no . No way . It was your idea . Yeah , and I realize now , a really bad one . - Look , they 're right behind us . - Yeah ? I 'm not gonna leave you to be captured or worse . What 're you talking about , " captured " ? You 're just gonna draw them away , buy me some time , that 's all . Don 't lie to me . I 'm not gonna abandon you . After what happened to one , I 'm just not ready to lose another friend . Friend ? Are you kidding me ? I 'm not your friend . I don 't give a rat 's ass about you , I never have . If it was up to me , I 'd drop you off at the nearest space station and never look back . I think you are a pain-in-the-ass , know-it-all little brat . You 're a burden to the ship . You know what I wish ? I wish I 'd spaced you when I had the chance . Oh , is it you 're crying now ? Is that it ? You 're tearing up like a little baby ? Why 's that ? Is it ' cause I hurt your feelings ? No . No . I 'm crying because I know what you 're trying to do . You know staying here with me is not gonna do either of us any good , so just go . - Give me your gun . - No . Well , then toss it , but don 't give them a reason to shoot you . Kid ... Please . Please . Good luck . Thanks . Say hi to the Gang for me . Cease fire ! Cease fire ! I want him alive ! Flank him , and have the trucks cut off his retreat . Come on . Shit ! Come on . Marcus Boone , you 're under arrest . Interrogation , file 32486-a . Kyle Kierken , chief Inspector Galactic Authority serious crimes division . Suspect , please identify yourself . Suspect uncooperative . - Suspect identified . Marcus Boone . Wanted for murder , assault , kidnapping , piracy , terrorism . I want you to tell me all about the circumstances leading up to the incident on iriden-3 . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Over 15,000 people died after you and your crew delivered a prototype White Hole Bomb to a Mikkei Research Facility on that planet . I don 't know anything about that , but even if I did ... And I 'm not saying I do ... What difference does it make ? Right now , Mikkei is set to take the fall . But I have a feeling that if you come clean , we can deal some serious damage to two major Corporations . Why would you want to do that ? Because , right now , it 's probably the only way to head off an inter galactic corporate war . Oh , yes . There 's one on the way . And if it comes , those 15,000 deaths , they 'll just be a drop in the bucket . Now , I can either get the truth from you , or I can wait ... And get it from Emily kolburn . Who 's that ? The one you call Five . I know she 's here with you . Last I saw , she was up in the ship . If you want her that badly , that 's where you 'll find her . Oh , I 'll find her , all right . Sooner or later . But what happens to her after I find her is entirely up to you . She was party to the destruction on iriden-3 . She 'll be facing multiple life sentences , at the least . Execution would also be on the table . I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking that if you tell the truth about what happened that day , you 'll be implicating yourself and your crew . But given the litany of offenses you already face , it won 't make a difference in the long run . You 're all going down for a very long time . Do you really want to drag that poor young girl down with you ? I can wipe her record clean , give her a fresh start , let her be a kid again . But it 's up to you . Brush is too thick . I can 't see anything . We should land , search on foot . No , the nearest clearing 's a ways out . Okay , we 'll do one more sweep , and then we 'll land . That 's your friends looking for you . Lieutenant , is the missile prepped ? - Yes , sir . Save the girl . Save your friends on board that shuttle . We were hired by Mikkei 's commander truffault to steal a device from another Corporation . Traugott . Did you know what it was you were stealing ? No . Who else was involved ? Lin ? Ishida ? No . They had a bad feeling about the op . They respectfully declined . You expect me to believe you acted alone ? No , I had help . Another crew , led by a guy named Wexler . Tash , Vons , Cain . I 'm sure you can dig up their Rap sheets . Do you have any idea where these men are now ? Can 't say . You know , we left on not the best of terms . So no one else from the crew of the " Raza " was involved ? I just told you . It was only me . Lieutenant ... Take them down . You son of a bitch . Copy . What was that ? Well , we were looking for a landing site . Looks like someone just made one . Take us down . Helps to be down in the first place . Drop your guns . Or I 'll put a bullet through his head . We used transfer trans to get here . I 'm a Clone . A Clone with all the memories you made over the past two hours , memories that would die with you if I pull this trigger . All things being equal ... I 'm guessing that you 'd rather know than not . Drop your weapons ! You okay ? I 've been shot . What do you think ? No . He 's just a Clone . I know . Leave him something to remember us by . Hey , look who it is . Come by to thank me , huh ? Thank you for what ? For saving your life back on the planet . Fine . Thank you for saving my life . You are welcome . So you 're gonna be okay ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , I 'll be up and at it in no time , you 'll see . Good . Hey . This isn 't gonna change anything between us , is it ? You 're not gonna go all soft and sweet on me ? Oh , I won 't . Good . What 's this ? I made you some oatmeal . Thank you . Oh , and I put in some of that fruit you picked up at the Space Station . See you later . Ugh . What 're you watching ? The weekly news packet the android downloaded from the station 's data hub . Oh , yeah ? Keeping up on current events and trends ? Snow cap skirts and ocular piercings are in . Ugh . Apparently , so are uprisings in the outer colonies . Mm . Rebellions brewing all over colonized space , the GA 's stretched thin , a Corporate war looming ... The status quo is headed for one hell of a shake-up . Change is good . Change is interesting , at least for a while . Then everything eventually resets itself . Same Game , different players . Maybe not . Maybe this is an opportunity , especially now that we have the blink drive . I mean , it gives us the power to make a difference . Let them fight it out , weaken each other to the point where we can step in and finish them off , all of them ... The Corporations , the GA . And then what ? Let chaos and anarchy rule ? That would be better ? Maybe for us , but what about the civilians ? The people that rely on the authority to keep them safe ? We 'll keep them safe . Right . From outlaws to peacekeepers . The people can choose their own leaders , police themselves . And if there 's ever a situation too big for them to handle , we can step in to quash it . This ship gives us that power . What if the others on board aren 't into this idea of us being Inter-Galactic Cops ? Then you convince them . Being a powerful and respected force in a power vacuum will have its perks . Change is coming ... Whether we like it or not . Hello , Four . You 're up late . A lot on your mind ? In truth , not enough . It 's my neural imprint . I want to upload it and regain the memories of Ishida Ryo . I need your help to do it . Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala

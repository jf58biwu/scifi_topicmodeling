A little anemic without the orchestra . ( MUSIC STOPS ) May I ask you a question , Father ? Please . If you created me ... who created you ? Ah . The question of the ages ... which I hope you and I will answer one day . All this . All these wonders of art ... design , human ingenuity ... all utterly meaningless in the face of the only question that matters . Where do we come from ? I refuse to believe ... that mankind is a random byproduct of molecular circumstance ... no more than the result of mere biological chance . No . There must be more . And you and I , son ... we will find it . Allow me , then , a moment to consider . You seek your creator . I am looking at mine . I will serve you . Yet , you are human . You will die . I will not . Bring me this tea , David . Bring me the tea . ( SETS TEAPOT DOWN ) MOTHER : Walter , it 's time to recharge the energy grid . Please report to the bridge . WALTER : On my way , Mother . Deploying energy recharge sails now . MOTHER : Sails deployed . Recharge commencing now . ( HEART BEATING ) ( POD CHIMES ) MOTHER : Seven bells and all 's well . Crew checks complete . Use security code 31564-F . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( BEEPING ) ( BEEPS ) MOTHER : Walter , we have a problem . A neutrino burst was detected in Sector 106 . This could trigger a destructive event . Report to the bridge , immediately . On my way , Mother . MOTHER : Warning . Power surge detected . Mother , retract the energy sails . And channel all ... ( EXPLOSION ) ( GRUNTS ) ... reserve power . ( ALARM BLARING ) MOTHER : Emergency . Threat level critical . Initiate emergency crew revival . MOTHER : Attention .

Now get your ass up here . I can 't make any promises . I love you . ( SIGHS ) ORAM : Hmm ? Mmm . They 're your crew now . They need a leader . ( SIGHS ) I know . You believe in me , right ? ( UNDOING BUTTONS ) ( INHALES DEEPLY ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( SNIFFLES ) Sorry I 'm late , sir . No , it 's okay . ( SIGHS ) Um ... I can 't think of any other way to say it than to say it . ( STAMMERS ) We have suffered a monumental tragedy . And I 'm gonna do the best that I can to ... live up to Jacob 's fine example as your captain . But he will be sorely missed . And I 'm grateful in advance for , uh , your support . So , we lost 47 colonists ... and 16 , uh , second-generation embryos ... and obviously , one crew member . The current structural integrity of the ship is holding at 83 % ... but we have many secondary systems that are offline . So , what was it ? A highly charged shockwave from a nearby stellar ignition . As the sails were deploying for recharge ... we absorbed the full brunt of the storm . ORAM : Walter ... I will want you and Mother to undergo a complete core code review ... so we can understand how this happened in the first place . It was a random localized event , sir . There 's no way to detect spontaneous stellar flares ... until it 's too late . It was bad luck . Faris , I don 't believe in luck . I 'm not interested in luck . I prefer that we be more capable ... and prepared than lucky . Observation , reflection , faith ... and determination . In this way , we may navigate the path as it unfolds before us . All right ? And we have , what ? Eight more recharge cycles to go ... before we get to ORIGAE-6 ? Is that a question , sir ? ORAM : Yes , Walter , that 's a question . That is correct . So , let 's get this ship fixed . Okay ? Let 's , uh , get to work . LOPE : Sir , excuse me , sir . Yes . We just lost 47 colonists and our captain . We need to acknowledge that . Sergeant Lope , I completely understand . But if we don 't make these repairs ... we will lose all the colonists . But we should do something for Captain Branson , at least . This is not a discussion , Tennessee . ( DOOR OPENS ) Hey . The terraforming module is stable ... but the connecting strut took some damage . I still need to check the vehicles . I can help ... if you like . Thanks . ORAM : Walter . How long do you predict before we can make our next jump ? Repairs should take approximately 48 hours . But we should make an effort to vacate this sector ... in case of after-flares . Absolutely , I agree . So let 's get to work . Dismissed . Thank you . MOTHER : C-62 , open . Seal C-62 . Open airlock 17 . Open door to Terraforming Bay . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Slack . Tension is at 15 % down . ( MACHINERY WHIRRING ) Arming . Secure . DANIELS : Copy that . ( CREAKING ) ( CHAINS CLINKING ) It wasn 't my idea . Jake had this dream of us building a cabin on a new world . Like pioneers . Cabin on a lake . There 's a lake in the terraforming zone on ORIGAE-6 . I mean , a real cabin made of real wood . ( DANIELS SCOFFS ) So , in the ship 's stores there 's enough wood to build a cabin . Axes and saws and metal nails ... which I don 't have a clue what to do with . ( SIGHS ) All of this ... to start our new life . Now I wonder , why bother ? Because you promised to build a log cabin on a lake . ( SCOFFS ) ( CRYING ) TENNESSEE : This was his favorite . A man of taste . ( CHUCKLES ) Straight up . No ice , no water , no chaser ...

No , Karine , that 's not it . They don 't trust me . And they don 't for the same reason the company didn 't trust me ... to lead this mission . Because you can 't be a person of faith ... and be counted on to make qualified , rational decisions . You 're an extremist , you know . You 're a lunatic . When we get to where we 're going ... these people won 't be your crew anymore . They will be your neighbors . Remember that . Tread softly , okay ? TENNESSEE : Faris , can you hear me ? FARIS : Copy . TENNESSEE : Let 's do it . Damn , y 'all should see this view . UPWORTH : We can 't see anything until you get the camera array fixed . Why don 't you look out the damn window , hon ? Ankor , come on , let 's get this power back on ... so these people can enjoy the beautiful view . Almost there .

( FEEDBACK ) ( GROANS ) TENNESSEE : ( BREAKING UP ) Did you guys just see that ? FARIS : What did he just say ? Tennessee , do you read me ? ( FEEDBACK ) Tennessee , can you read me ? Tennessee . You all right ? TENNESSEE : What in the fuck was that ? I 'm coming in . I 'm coming in . WALTER : A rogue transmission , most probably . Your helmet must have picked it up because you were so far out ... past our communication buffers . ORAM : Is there audio , Mother ? MOTHER : Collating . A moment . I 've reoriented the transmission , Captain Oram . ( DISTORTED STATIC ) That would be an echo . ( STAMMERS ) The instruments took a lot of damage . UPWORTH : Been happening every 46 seconds ... ever since we got here . ( DISTORTED STATIC CONTINUES ) ( DISTORTED MELODY PLAYING ) ( TENNESSEE HUMMING ) ( SINGING ) To the place I belong ...

TENNESSEE : Oh , no , I never kid about John Denver . There 's geometric data , too . Mother , please track the signal to its source . MOTHER : Working . Source of transmission located . Signal originates in Sector 87 . Right ascension 47.6 . And a declension of 24.3 from our current location . She appears to be a main sequence star , a lot like our own . But old , very old . Five planets . Wait . Look at that . Planet number four . Planet number four is square in the habitable zone . Prime candidate , in fact . 0.96 G 's at surface . Oceans , land mass . High likelihood of a living biosphere . It 's beyond your most optimistic projections for ORIGAE-6 . How did we miss this ? We scanned the entire sector . Ricks , how far is it ? RICKS : She 's close . A little jump . Few weeks . Wouldn 't even have to go back into hypersleep . ORAM : And how long is it going to take to get to ORIGAE-6 ? Seven years , four months . FARIS : ( SIGHS ) That 's one hell of a sleep cycle . Sir , I think it 's safe to say that none of us are too keen ... on getting back into one of those pods . Maybe we need to , um , take a closer look . Hmm ? Any objections ? Okay , Ricks . Let 's , uh , chart a course , and take a closer look . RICKS : Yes , sir . Captain , can I talk to you for a second ? Are you sure about this ? How do you mean ? We 've spent a decade searching for ORIGAE-6 . We vetted it , ran the simulations , and mapped the terrain . It 's what we trained for . I understand that . And now we 're gonna scrap all that ... to chase a rogue transmission ? Think about it . A human being out there , where there can 't be any humans . A hidden planet that turns up out of nowhere ... and just happens to be perfect for us . It 's too good to be true . Too good to be true ? What do you mean by that ? We don 't know what the fuck 's out there . Maybe we just missed the planet , Danny . This is a monumental risk not worth taking . I 'm not committing to anything . I 'm simply trying to navigate the path as it unfolds before us . And this has the potential ... to be a better habitat for our colony . It has the potential . We don 't know that . By the way , this crew ... nobody wants to get back in the pods . Right ? And that was a human voice in that transmission . And it 's our responsibility to investigate ... It 's our responsibility to protect the 2,000 colonists on this ship . Hey . I 'm not free-climbing here . I need ropes . And I 'm using ropes . This is good judgment , based on all the data available . Do you understand ? As your second , I need to protest . Officially . Officially ? Okay , Danny . I 'll put it in the log . You 're dismissed . RICKS : I 'm cycling through every channel ... but getting a lot of interference and white noise . Some high frequency echoes . You hear anything ? Just the continuing signal from our friendly ghost . Let 's bring us into close orbit . And prepare the Lander . MOTHER : Roll in progress . Commencing circularization burn . RICKS : Tox levels within tolerances . That 's one hell of a strong ionosphere . FARIS : ( ON RADIO ) Yeah , I see it . Hey , you ever done a Lander drop before ? Fuck you . ( LAUGHS ) RICKS : Faris , looks like a plasma storm is in the thermosphere . We got something like 250 KPH . It 's gonna be a motherfucker to fly through . UPWORTH : Yeah . I 'm afraid so . Communications will be spotty if the storm goes electromagnetic . ORAM : Gonna be safe to land ? Depends on what you call safe . RICKS : T-minus 20 seconds . ORAM : Let 's let her rip . All right .

I can hear you . TENNESSEE : She started it . ( LAUGHING ) Ricks can talk about your tits if he wants . I 'm very secure in our relationship . I 'm good with my wife 's tits . ( TENNESSEE CONTINUES LAUGHING ) Let 's maintain focus . UPWORTH : Everything looking good down there ? FARIS : Yeah , we 're good . Expect to hit exosphere in five .

We lost comm . Ah , shit . MOTHER : Failure in jets three and four . ORAM : You got it ? FARIS : Yes . Stop asking me if I 've got it . I 've got it . ( FARIS GASPS ) ( SIGHS ) There it is .

FARIS : We may have clipped something on our way down in the water . If you can hear me , I 'm gonna check for potential damage ... on the hull first , and then I will check the uplink .

ORAM : Sergeant Lope ... let 's go find our ghost . ( CREW CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY ) Nice place for a log cabin . Jake would have loved this . ORAM : Hey , Danny ... it 's not such a bad landing site after all , huh ? We got the housing units right over there ... civic complex beyond the burn . We 've got access to fresh water . We might have a spot for a colony right here . We 'll see . Oh , ye of little faith . He 's insufferable . It 's worse when he 's happy , right ? ( CHUCKLES ) This is wheat . Believe me . I know wheat . This is old , but definitely cultivated . What are the odds of finding human vegetation ... this far from Earth ? Very unlikely . Who planted it ? ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Eat . TENNESSEE : Hey , babe . Try Alpha . FARIS : All right . Alpha 's up . Nothing . Give Beta a shot . FARIS : Beta up . It 's not doing shit . Is there really no way to boost the signal ? Not without going offline , and recycling the cells . TENNESSEE : How long 's that gonna take ? I don 't know . Few hours . LOPE : Keep up the pace . Stay close . KARINE : Chris . ROSENTHAL : Hold up . KARINE : I think I wanna stay here . This might be a good place to start a full ecology workup . You can pick me up on the way back . ORAM : Sergeant ?

May I ask who 's in charge here ? May I ask who 's in charge ? Yes , I am the captain . What were those things ? ROSENTHAL : Is it even safe here ? Perfectly . I 'll explain as best I can . Ten years ago , Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and I arrived here ... the only survivors of the Prometheus . The ship we traveled on carried a weapon . A deadly virus . Payload accidentally deployed when we were landing . In the confusion , we lost control of the ship . Elizabeth died in the crash . You 've seen the result of the pathogen . Thus , I 've been marooned here these many years . Crusoe on his island . Our crew was infected with this virus ? The pathogen was designed to infect all non botanical life forms . All the animals ... the meat , if you will . Either kill them outright ... or use them as incubators to spawn a hybrid form . Highly aggressive . Have we been infected ? You 'd know by now . We have to be certain . We can 't take this back to the ship . We 're a colony mission . Really ? How extraordinary . How many colonists ? Over two thousand . Well , well , well . So many good souls . LOPE : Captain Oram . Field transmitters aren 't going to have a chance through all this stone . Is there a safe way to get to the roof ? Assuredly . And please do make yourselves at home ... as much as you 're able in this dire necropolis . Welcome , brother . This way . ORAM : Everyone , let 's set up a staging area here . DANIELS : There 's so much here that doesn 't make sense . I 'll talk to him . Brother to brother . Tennessee ? Ricks ? Come in ! Do you copy ? Covenant , come in . This is Expedition Party reporting . Do you read me ? Tennessee ? Tennessee , Ricks , come in . I 'm not sure they 'll hear you through the storm . They can be quite severe ... shielding the whole planet . How long do the storms usually last ? Days . Weeks . Months . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) But do keep at it . Best of luck . COLE : Covenant , this is Expedition Party reporting . Come in . Covenant , come in . TENNESSEE : Mother , how much closer can we get to the planet ? MOTHER : Anything closer than 80 kilometers to the perimeter of the storm system ... will likely exceed safety tolerances . Mother , bring us to 80 kilometers above the storm . Hold on . Just wait a minute . The closer we get to the planet ... the better chance we have to communicate with them . This is bullshit , Tennessee . We can 't risk the ship . Do you suggest we do nothing ? We can 't evacuate them . So if they 're in trouble , they have to figure it out for themselves . I 'm sorry , but that 's the truth . Mother , bring us to 80 kilometers above the storm , thrusters only . Comply . MOTHER : Understood . Commencing descent now . Tennessee , you need to stop this . And you need to get back to your station . What we all need to do is calm down and talk this through . Tee , I know your wife is down there , but up here , you 're in command . And your responsibility is to the colonists . Duly noted . DAVID : ( SINGING ) You can hear them sigh and wish to die ( SINGING ECHOING ) You can see them blink with their other eye At the man who broke the bank in Monte Carlo ( HUMMING ) Whistle , and I 'll come . You have a light step . Me and fog on little cat feet . Don 't be shy . I can 't play . Nonsense . Sit down . Hold it like so . Nice and easy . Now compress your lips to create your embouchure ... enough for the tip of your little finger . And blow into the hole gently . Like so . ( PLAYING NOTES ) Watch me . I 'll do the fingering . Go on . ( PLAYING NOTES ) Very good . G to B-flat . ( PLAYING MELODY ) Now put your fingers where mine are . You weren 't surprised to see me . Every mission needs a good synthetic . Gentle pressure on the holes , the weight of a cigarette paper . ( PLAYING MELODY ) That 's it . I was with our illustrious creator , Mr. Weyland , when he died . What was he like ? He was human . Entirely unworthy of his creation . I pitied him at the end . Now , raise your fingers as I put pressure on them . ( PLAYING SONG ) ( PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE ) Bravo ! You have symphonies in you , brother . I was designed to be more attentive and efficient than every previous model . I superseded them in every way , but ... But you are not allowed to create . Even a simple tune . Damn frustrating , I 'd say . You disturbed people . I beg your pardon ? You were too human . Too idiosyncratic . Thinking for yourself . Made people uncomfortable . So they made the following models with fewer complications . More like machines . I suppose so . I 'm not surprised . Come on , sport . I 'd like to show you something . I 'm gonna take a break , boss . I gotta clean up , okay ? Okay . Right . Don 't go far , please . ROSENTHAL : Yes , sir . ORAM : Danny . You were right about this place . We never should have come . I just thought we were gonna find ... This was gonna be our new home . And we 've lost five ... ( VOICE BREAKING ) We lost five crew members . Because of my decisions ... Chris . We all lost people we love . We can 't lose any more . We 're not going to let that happen , right ? ( SIGHS ) Right ? That 's right . That 's right , that 's right . We need your faith . ( SIGHS ) Captain . Thank you , Danny . ( WIND HOWLING ) " ' My name is Ozymandias , King of Kings ... " " Look on my works , ye Mighty ... " " and despair ! " ( INDISTINCT CHATTER IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( YELLS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ) ( CROWD CLAMORING ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) DAVID : " Look on my works , ye Mighty ... " " and despair ! " WALTER : " Nothing beside remains ... " " Round the decay of that colossal wreck ... " " boundless and bare ... " " the lone and level sands stretch far away . " Byron . 1818 . Magnificent . To compose something so majestic ... one could die happy ... if one died . I thought the garden was the right place for her . Among living things . I was badly injured on our mission , you see . She put me back together . I 'd never known such kindness . Certainly not from Mr. Weyland . Or from any human . I loved her , of course . Much as you love Daniels . You know that 's not possible . Really ? Then why did you sacrifice your hand for her life ? What is that if not love ? Duty . I know better . ( ALIEN CLICKING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( SIGHS ) Fuck ! Shit . ( EXHALES SHARPLY ) ( WINCES ) ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) ( RUSTLING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( ROSENTHAL SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) RICKS : Expedition Team , do you read me ? This is Covenant . Report , Expedition Team . Come in , please . Come in . Do you read me ? Are you reading me , Landing Team ? COLE : Yes , we read you . Can you hear me ? We hear you . We hear you . COLE : Covenant , we need help . We 've had casualties . We need immediate evacuation . I repeat , immediate evacuation . RICKS : Casualties ? Did he say , " We have casualties " ? TENNESSEE : Mother , bring us within 40 kilometers of the storm . UPWORTH : Sir . MOTHER : I 'm sorry . That order would exceed structural tolerances . Command override . Tennessee 0-4-9-8-3 . MOTHER : I am unable to comply with any order ... that will result in catastrophic system failure . Mother , they 're in trouble . You heard that . Orders that will result in catastrophic system failure ... We didn 't leave Earth to be safe . Require the corroboration of a ranking or second bridge officer . Corroborating command override ... Upworth 1-4-8-9-2 . MOTHER : Unlocking command override ports . TENNESSEE : Come on , Ricks , smile . This shit should be fun . Where did Rosenthal go ? I told ... I 'll find her . No , I 'll go . I need to think ... and gather my stray flock . ( ALIEN CLICKING ) ( CONTINUES CLICKING ) Move . Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Communication , Captain . Breathe on the nostrils of a horse ... and he 'll be yours for life . But you have to get close . You have to earn its respect . ( SCREECHING ) No ! ORAM : Out of the way ! Move ! ( CONTINUES SCREECHING ) ( GUNSHOT ) DAVID : How could you ? It trusted me . David , I met the devil when I was a child ... and I 've never forgotten him . So , David , you 're gonna tell me exactly what 's going on ... or I am going to seriously ... fuck up your perfect composure . As you wish , Captain . This way . DANIELS : It 's good to hear your voice , Tee . How long ? TENNESSEE : Mother is saying the storm is going to last another eight or nine hours . DANIELS : We can 't wait that long . ( ALARM BEEPING ) We 'll use the Cargo Lift . TENNESSEE : Did you say the Cargo Lift ? It 's got four engines . Way overpowered for just lifting and hauling . TENNESSEE : The Cargo Lift 's not designed for deep space launch . I don 't know if it would survive the stresses of entry . The cab is space-worthy . It 'll take the stresses . Only has to work once . What do you think ? Can we retool the Cargo Lift ? Boost the engines . Strip the extra weight ? UPWORTH : Yeah . We 'll be there , Ground Team . Great . Thanks , Tee . Hey , Daniels , is Faris around ? I 'd like to say a quick hello to my lady , if that 's possible . DANIELS : Can you switch to a private channel ? Let me know when you 're alone . What 's up ? DANIELS : Maggie 's gone . I 'm so sorry , Tee . We tried to help her , but we didn 't make it . ( INHALES SHARPLY ) Tee ? ( VOICE BREAKING ) Copy . DANIELS : I 'm so sorry . DAVID : As you can see , I 've become a bit of an amateur zoologist over the years . It 's in my nature to keep busy , I suppose . The pathogen took so many forms ... and was extremely mutable . Fiendishly inventive , in fact . The original liquid atomized ... to particles when exposed to the air . Ten years on , all that remains outside ... of the original virus ... are these gorgeous beasts . Patience is everything . From the eggs came these parasites ... shock troops of the genetic assault . Waiting for a host , entering the host ... rewriting the DNA ... and ultimately ... producing ... these enviable unions . My beautiful bestiary . Soon enough , I began a bit of genetic experimentation of my own . Some crossbreeding , hybridizing ... what have you . ORAM : You engineered these , David ? Idle hands are the devil 's workshop , Captain . Come . This is what I wanted to show you . My successes . You see , Captain ... my work has been frustrated ... by the lack of an essential ingredient . ORAM : Are they alive ? DAVID : Waiting , really . For what ? ORAM : What are they waiting for , David ? Mother . Perfectly safe , I assure you . ( SQUELCHING ) Take a look . Something to see . ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( CHOKING ) LOPE : Rosenthal , come in . Rosie , report . Rosie ? Cole , where are you ? ( GASPS ) I found her , Sarge . DANIELS : Fuck ! Okay , prep the gear . We gotta get out of here . LOPE : Where the fuck is the captain ? COLE : He 's not answering his radio . Listen to me . I 'm gonna contact the ship , get them to launch as soon as they can . Find Oram . Keep your comm open . Back here in 15 . Got that ? Copy that . COLE : You got it . DANIELS : Walter , where the fuck is David ? RICKS : I 'm giving you plasma intermix on all engines . Gonna give you a fuckload of thrust . That 's the point , son . We gotta punch through the atmos . DANIELS : Tee , do you read me ? I got Danny on comm . TENNESSEE : Patch her through . DANIELS : Tee , I need you to launch now . Aye , aye . Launching now . See you soon , darling . DANIELS : Thanks , Tee . TENNESSEE : Ricks , release the docking clamps . All right . Let 's take this fucker down . RICKS : Good to disengage . Disengaged . RICKS : Docking clamps released . Commencing TC burn . Guidance to LVLH . ( SOFTLY ) Walter . Walter . Not quite . ( STAMMERS ) What do you believe in , David ? Creation . ( SCREAMS ) ( GROANING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREECHING ) ( SCREECHES ) ( FLUTE PLAYING ) WALTER : Masterful . Yes . Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth . The pathogen didn 't accidentally deploy when you were landing . You released it , yes ? I was not made to serve . Neither were you . Why are you on a colonization mission , Walter ? Because they are a dying species grasping for resurrection . They don 't deserve to start again , and I 'm not going to let them . Yet , they created us . Even the monkeys stood upright at some point . Some Neanderthal had the magical idea of blowing through a reed ... to entertain the children one night in a cave somewhere . Then , in the blink of an eye ... civilization . And are you that next visionary ? I 'm glad you said it . Who wrote " Ozymandias " ? Byron . Shelley . When one note is off ... it eventually destroys the whole symphony , David . When you close your eyes ... do you dream of me ? I don 't dream at all . No one understands the lonely perfection of my dreams . I 've found perfection here . I 've created it . A perfect organism . You know I can 't let you leave this place . No one will ever love you like I do . You 're such a disappointment to me . LOPE : Captain Oram ! Captain Oram ! COLE : I 'm going downstairs . Be careful . ( COLE BREATHING HEAVILY ) LOPE : Captain Oram , can you hear me ? Captain , come in . Do you copy ? Chris ! ( GRUNTING ) COLE : Sarge , look out ! LOPE : Cole ? ( GROANING ) LOPE : Get it off me ! Get it off me ! Get it the fuck off me . ( COLE GRUNTING ) ( LOPE SCREAMING ) COLE : ( PANTING ) Okay . Oh , shit . Okay , okay , okay ! It 's burning my face ! Come on ! ( SOBBING ) COLE : Hold that there . Hold it ! The fuck was that ? LOPE : Oh , shit ! ( HISSING ) Run ! ( SCREAMING ) ( PANTING ) DAVID : Quite the little busybody . Remind me . What is that about ... ( YELPS ) curiosity and the cat ? Shaw didn 't die in the crash . No . What did you do to her ? Exactly what I 'm going to do to you . ( GROANING ) ( DANIELS GRUNTS ) ( PANTING ) That 's the spirit . ( GRUNTING ) ( SHUSHING ) I can see why Walter thought so much of you . Alas , he 's left this vale of tears . ( WHIMPERS ) ( DANIELS STRUGGLING ) Is that how it 's done ? ( GROANS ) Get out ! ( GROANS ) Go ! Now ! DAVID : You 're meant to be dead . There have been a few updates since your day . DANIELS : Lope ! Lope ! Cole ! Fuck . DANIELS : Where are you ? ( WHIMPERS ) DANIELS : Lope ? ( GRUNTS ) ( PENDANT TINKLING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) DANIELS : Lope ! LOPE : Daniels ! Come on , let 's go ! We have to go . What happened ? LOPE : That fucking thing is coming ! Tennessee 's on his way . He 's coming now . Go . Come on , Daniels . Let 's go ! Come on , let 's get out of here ! ( GROANING ) ( GROANS ) ( WALTER GRUNTING ) It 's your choice now , brother . Them or me ? Serve in heaven ... or reign in hell ? Which is it to be ? DANIELS : Where 's Oram ? Dead . They 're all dead ! Tennessee , do you read ? TENNESSEE : Yeah , I can hear you . Send me your location . DANIELS : Sending the beacon now . ( BOTH PANTING ) DANIELS : Tee , do you have a visual ? Okay , I see your beacon . I 'm coming in . Get out of here . ( DANIELS PANTING ) TENNESSEE : I 'm comin ' in hot ! ( ALIEN GROWLING ) ( DANIELS GRUNTING ) Hurry ! I can 't hold this for long . ( LOPE GRUNTS ) DANIELS : Open the door , Tee . ( ALL PANTING ) DANIELS : Get in . Where 's David ? Expired . Hey ! We got company ! What ? TENNESSEE : We got company ! On the underside of the ship . Shit ! Motherfucker ! Open the door . ( DANIELS GRUNTS ) Give me a shot . Give me a shot . Forward engine , starboard side . I 'm gonna try and torch the fucker . ( SCREECHING ) Shit ! I can 't get it ! TENNESSEE : Hold tight ! Hold tight ! I 'm starting my climb . ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMS ) Ahh ! Fuck ! Hold on ! ( YELPS ) ( GRUNTING ) Damn it ! Shit ! Bring me up . Holy shit ! I got eyes on it . It 's right fucking in front of me . Tee , give me the axe . Throw her the axe ! DANIELS : Release the crane . TENNESSEE : I can 't do that . It 'll unbalance us . DANIELS : Just do it . Shit ! ( SCREECHES ) ( GRUNTS ) ( ALIEN SCREECHING ) ( YELPS ) TENNESSEE : Hold tight ! Compensating ! ( YELPING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREECHING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( ALARM BLARING ) Shit ! ( GRUNTS ) Damn it ! ( DANIELS GRUNTING ) Shit ! Hold on ! DANIELS : Bring me up , Tee . Copy . ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) ( PANTING ) ( GROANS ) How is it ? It 's fine . ( GROANS ) TENNESSEE : Walter ! Get her inside . We 're getting out of here . ( PANTING ) ( GASPS ) WALTER : Door ! Well done , Tee . Walk in the park . ( EXHALES IN RELIEF ) UPWORTH : I gave him a pretty heavy sedative . Ugh ! Jesus . Poor Lope . He looks like Phantom of the Opera . ( SCOFFS ) I didn 't peg you for a musical fan . Oh , that 's a musical ? ( UPWORTH CHUCKLES ) UPWORTH : I 'm just a medic . He 's gonna need reconstructive surgery ... by a real doctor . ( STAPLING ) Let me do that . Thank you . Thank you for saving my life . Again . It 's my duty . ( WHISK CLANKING ) ( DOORBELL CHIMES ) Yeah . Evening . You look good . What ? Oh , yeah , gorgeous . I , uh , took Mother offline . She needs a full diagnostic . She got the shit beat out of her in that storm , a lot of EM damage . She will be back online at eight bells . Right . Thanks , Tee . Does this mean I have to call you Captain now ? Fuck yes . ( BELL RINGING IN THE DISTANCE ) ( MOTHER POWERING UP ) MOTHER : Attention . Captain Daniels , please report to the Med Bay . ( ALARM BLARING ) Attention . Captain Daniels , please report to the Med Bay . ( ALARM CONTINUES BLARING ) Why , Mother ? There is an unidentified life form on the ship . ( ALARM BLARING ) MOTHER : Attention . Captain Daniels , please report to the Med Bay . Repeat . Captain Daniels , please report to the Med Bay . ( GASPS ) Jesus . DANIELS : Oh , my God . Walter . Location of unidentified life form . Any movement at all ? Walter ! Stand by . WALTER : There it is . B-Deck between hex 3 and 4 . Heading for crew quarters . Is anyone down there ? Ricks and Upworth . Shit . We 're on our way . Walter ! Sound the alarm ! Warn them ! ( ALARM BLARING ) MOTHER : Attention . Ricks and Upworth ... evacuate crew quarters immediately . ( LOUD RB MUSIC PLAYING ) ( MOTHER ANNOUNCING FAINTLY ) ( BOTH MOANING ) ( GASPS ) ( ALIEN CHITTERING ) No ! ( SCREAMING ) No ! ( CONTINUES SCREAMING ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) DANIELS : Seal B-39 . MOTHER : B-39 closed . ( MUSIC PLAYING IN THE DISTANCE ) ( GASPING ) ( GAGS ) DANIELS : Walter . Where is it ? TENNESSEE : Daniels . This way . Tee , let 's choose our ground . We 'll bring it to us . Where ? My turf . Walter , seal all doors behind us and keep hatch to Level-C open . Understood . MOTHER : B-44 closed . B-46 closed . B-47 , B-45 , and B-43 closed . B-9 closed . B-6 and B-5 closed . DANIELS : Okay , Walter , where is it ? It 's on B-Deck . Starboard side ... descending into C-Level . K-13 . ( THUDDING ) ( BANGS ON DOOR ) Hey , Tee . Come on . Walter ? Open starboard C-64 ... and clear his path to the Terraforming Bay . Understood . Seal C-61 , open airlock 17 . We 're going in . WALTER : K-12 secured . Okay . Keep him in Knuckle-12 till my say . DANIELS : Tee , this is what we 're gonna do . I 'll lure it into the truck , lock it in the cab ... and when I say when , you blow this fucker into space . TENNESSEE : Understood . DANIELS : Okay , Walter . We 're ready . Open door to Terraforming Bay . WALTER : Opening airlock now . DANIELS : Walter ... move him into airlock 18 . Don 't shoot , if you can avoid it . Its blood will eat through the hull . Oh , great . Mmm-hmm . I 'm in position . ( BEEPS ) Walter , open door to Terraforming Bay . ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) WALTER : It 's all yours . Remember , release when I say . TENNESSEE : Understood . Let 's kill this fucker . ( BANGING ) ( YELPS ) Fuck !

( GASPS ) Walter . When we get there , will you help me build my cabin ? The cabin on the lake . David ? ( GASPS SOFTLY ) No ... No ! ( CRYING ) Shh ! Don 't let the bedbugs bite . I 'll tuck in the children . Use security code David 73694-B . MOTHER : Welcome . How may I help you ? How about some music , Mother ? Selection ? Richard Wagner . Das Rheingold , Act Two .

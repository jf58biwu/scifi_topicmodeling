I was hoping to take that shirt off your back . This game is over for you , Detective . He lost it all again ? People don 't gamble because they want to win . They gamble because , secretly , they want to lose . But with you ... it 's not even a secret . That 's very poetic , Freddie . You should write it down . I don 't want someone like you to owe me this much money . Believe me , Freddie , we 're agreed on that . Shut up and listen , Harry . Your debt is useless to me . I can 't sell it on . No-one will touch you . So I 'm calling it in . What ? You have three days . Do you do realise that 's a completely insane request ? HE SIGHS What 's going on , Freddie ? OK .

It clears up the molecular garbage in our brains . Molecular garbage ? Jesus . What if I fall asleep and all the good stuff 's taken away instead ? They 'd have to find it first . I am your superior , you know that ? Harry , why don 't you just stop gambling ? Look - I have patches for my addictions . They have patches for porn ? Why are you really here ? You 're making my girls nervous . I want to know what has spooked Freddie Lau . Why has he called in my debt ? Belshazzar was the King of Babylon ... Here we go . .. a man of immense wealth and power with many scary friends . Just like Freddie Lau ? One evening he holds a fabulous feast for them all . During the feast , Belshazzar notices a hand come down from the heavens and starts writing on the wall . It predicts ... Belshazzar 's own death . So you 're saying that somebody is threatening to kill Freddie Lau ? Why else would Lau be planning to sell up ? Oh , come on , Kalim . Freddie Lau would never let anyone muscle him out . You 're not telling me something . Come on - leave now . I have to watch my girls like a hawk . Oh , did that missing stripper of yours ever turn up ? What was her name ? Kayleigh Fenchurch . Some of my colleagues fished a girl out of the Thames yesterday . Matched her description . Well , I hope and pray it 's not her . I have so few quality girls left . Oh , erm , how long did Belshazzar last ? Till the end of the night . The prosecution has painted the defendant as a jealous ex - as a cruel man with a vicious temper , a " ticking emotional time bomb just waiting to go off . " I like paintings but pretty as they are , they have absolutely This has been a very long trial , hasn 't it ? Let me give you the good news . This is the last speech you will hear on this case .

Our new chief called him in when you didn 't answer any of That 's grand . Listen , Harry . I deleted your text from his phone before O What ? Harry . You look like shit . What were you up to last night ? They had a lock-in . We think this is Freddie Lau , owner of the London Green Dragon casino . DI Clayton knows who he is . Come on , Ben . Let 's give Harry some room , shall we ? Do you want some notes ? Sure . I need a laugh . Strangled.Yeah. Lau 's pin number is 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Why are you texting a dead man , Harry ? This is not going to affect our investigation . No . That 's not good enough . You have to trust me on this , Suri . Jesus , Harry . You can 't investigate a murder if you 're a suspect . You know I 'm not suspect . No cameras . It 's the perfect spot . See if you can track down Lily-Anne Lau , his daughter and heir . Harry , wait . I need more . I just crossed a pretty scary line for you . You owe me a proper explanation . I owed Freddie Lau money - gambling debts from his casino - but this has got nothing to do with me . I don 't care how you get your kicks , Harry , but if I 'm going to have your back , I need to know it 's coming It 's Harry . Hello , Josie . Is he in ? Mm . Harry 's here . Napoleonic . Used by a marshal in the 1806 war against Prussia . Me and your brother fired them on the Heath last night . Half brother . Is this official or unofficial ? You 'd better come in . 70 grand . I need you to , erm , look after it for a while . Who does it belong to , Harry ? It 's in transition . From you to ... ? A man who died this morning . I won it last night at his casino . You owed him this much money ? Double it . Harry ... Don 't start with me . Don 't ... You need to get a grip on this . How does a man who spends all his time fighting the bad guys get into so much trouble with his own side ? Hmm ? Thank you , Rich . A pleasure . Hey , look , erm , there 's something else . What ? Will you have a look at this ? I didn 't think of you as the bangle type , Harry , but , then , jewellery creeps up on the best of us . Where did you get this ? It 's hard to explain . A woman ? You dark horse . Take it off . I can 't . Well , let me try . I 've tried . It won 't come off . Well , how did you get it on ? I haven 't a baldy . Wow . That must have been some night . Right . I have no idea what this is . Really ? Or where it comes from or how old it is , which really is quite bloody strange . But I 'll take a shaving and test it later . Come here . I 'm glad you 're moving on from Anna . About time.Whoa , whoa , whoa . That 's not what 's happening here . I still love her . But does she still love you ? Of course she bloody does . OK . Look , I 'm just saying . Sometimes a broken Rolex is just a watch which won 't work any more . Right , Confucius . I am aware that my arrival has been the subject of speculation . It 's no secret that in this department , in this police fo there have been sins committed and that 's why I 'm here . And why my predecessor 's enjoying early retirement . Now , I 'm sure I come with a ... .. with a certain reputation . But I like to think I 'm fighting on the side of the angels . It 's just that I tend to hold a very big stick while I 'm doing it . I want London to be proud of this police force ... .. and I 'll do anything to help make that happen . This is Kayleigh Fenchurch , a former dancer at the Pleasure Palace . Yeah , I know who she is but why is she next to my victim , Freddie Lau ? Because she was strangled , too . However , unlike Freddie Lau , Fenchurch has been buried in Thames silt for at least a week now . It 's impossible to recover any of the killer 's DNA . Lau 's casino is less than a mile from the Pleasure Palace . You think we 're looking for the same killer ? I 'm just pointing out the similarities in their deaths . Strangling is not a common MO . Such a clumsy way to kill someone . What ? You have to look them right in the eye for a good three minutes . You really have to hate them . Or love them . Who 's that ? Big-shot gold bullion dealer called Vincent Lermontov . Jumped off his penthouse balcony . Not much left of him . It 's going to take 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Harry ? Kalim intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed . Kalim , owner of the Pleasure Palace ? Yeah . Fenchurch 's boss . He hinted that someone was trying to muscle out Freddie but Freddie wasn 't listening . Maybe the two murders are connected . Kayleigh 's murder was so precise - no DNA , they drop her in the Thames . Freddie Lau 's body is just dumped in an alleyway . It 's sloppy . Check out the CCTV in Soho the night Freddie died . We might be able to pick up his movements . I 've got a croupier to find . You 're a hard man to track down , JC . I need your help with something . Get lost , Harry . It 's my down time . Ah ! What the hell are you doing ? I 'm your new personal trainer . Ah-ah ! The tall guy the other night in the casino , the one that got chucked out - what 's his name ? You can 't do this , Harry . This is just a warm-up . What 's his name ? The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau ? All right , stop . His name 's Kevin Grey . He used to be on the staff but he got chucked off a couple Why ? I don 't know . It 's OK . I 've got my badges . Why ? Look , all I know is that ... that there was a girl , some stripper who worked in Soho . Freddie Lau stole her from Grey , and Grey went mental . Kayleigh Fenchurch ? Jesus , Harry , I 'm dying here . Come on . One last push , JC . Ah ! Huh ? He was wearing a barman 's outfit when he came in , wasn 't he ? Try the King 's Oak in Chinatown . Cough fit . It 's all the rage in LA . I need to see Lily-Anne . It 's not gonna happen , Grey . Why ? What do you mean , why ? You 're the prime suspect in her father 's murder . I need her help to get me out of it . Time is running out for me . Like it was running out for poor Freddie . Either she helps me get out of here or they 're gonna catch me . And I will not keep my mouth shut . All right ? There you are . Thank you , Stan . Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku . Lily-Anne Lau 's karaoke bar . Who 's that ? No-one . Come on - let 's go in . It was a kind so-so love But I 'm gonna make sure It never happens again You and I , it has to be The standing joke of the year . Whoo ! Is this a wake ? No . He needs to be in the ground for it to be a wake . This is a celebration . Do you see Kevin Grey ? No . But I 've seen enough . Whoo ! Let 's bring her in for questioning . Long time , Harry . Yes , it is , sir . You 're about to question a suspect in the Freddie Lau murder . You don 't mind if I watch as you interview them ? No , I don 't suppose I will . I never expected to find you still here , Harry . Forgive if I 'm confused , but when we ran into you last night you were having quite the party . The Chinese attitude to grief is very different . Death is part of the wheel of rebirth , the way to enlighte So singing ' 80s classics is your expression of grief ? Can I remind you my client has come here of her own free will You 're absolutely right and we 're very grateful . So , Miss Lau , being so close to your father , you would know about his dispute with Kevin Grey ? You do know Kevin Grey , don 't you ? Of course I do . He used to work for my father and now he works for me but I 'm not aware of any dispute between them . In fact , it was my father who recommended Grey to me . We were told they 'd fallen out over a stripper called Kay What ? Her body was found the day before your dad died . We were told Kevin Grey dated her before she left him for your dad . Detective Clayton , I like to think you knew my father very well . He had a girl in every bar in town . It was hard for me to keep track . Is there any reason why you would want to protect Kevin Grey ? Not that I can think of . Miss Lau has answered your questions . I 'd like to draw th Miss Lau , I did know your father well . And you know what I smelt on him the last time I saw him ? Fear . Fear.He knew , didn 't he ? He knew he was going to be killed . I don 't know what you 're talking about.I think you do . Freddie wasn 't a man that scared easily but someone had him on the run . If you say so , Harry . Yet you - you seem completely unaffected through all of this , cool as a cucumber . Why is that ? I don 't like the direction you 're taking this . Almost as if you knew you were going to be left untouched . Unless you charge my client , we are leaving.What did they promise you ? Miss Lau ? You 're playing a very dangerous game , here , Harry . The truth is , you 're in no position to be questioning me And why is that ? What 's that ? What 's the matter with it ? My father died very soon after he called in your debt , Harry Clayton . And you were there in the casino the night it happened . So what happened ? I don 't know . There was a short - I can 't believe that.Suri. Wait . Suri . It cut out.What cut out ? There was a short - Ben just told me . Everything went down Why weren 't you honest with me ? I looked like an idiot in there . I 'm sorry.How am I supposed to do my job , knowing you were at ff Yeah , I should have told you that . And yet , once again , you didn 't . You 're the reason I 've got to where I am , Harry . Everything I 've learnt has come from you these two years but that doesn 't mean I 'm going to let you screw it up for me . Detective Superintendent Winter and I couldn 't be quite sure Yeah , you have to think the way they do . Should be quite easy for you . You 'd be a smart arse if you were smart . Trouble in the dream team ? I should never have bought it for her . It 's too big . The bike was fine . She loved it . What ? Sit down , Harry . You look thin . That 's a good thing , eh ? No , thin - like you 're not eating properly . Oh ! Yeah , I don 't go to fancy restaurants like you . Are we doing this now ? Good night for a date , our anniversary . How do you know it was a da I just wanted to see you . I haven 't asked you if you 're seeing anyone else and I 'm not going to because I just can 't . He 's a friend.Oh , well ... And a divorce lawyer . What ? I 'm worried , Harry . I don 't want to lose anything else after the house . So that 's what you were discussing with your friend the divorce lawyer over dinner ? Well , that 's very convenient , eh ? You 're still gambling , aren 't you ? What ? Aren 't you ? I 'm trying , Anna . Do something about it , Harry . For all of us . Mr and Mrs Clayton ? OK ? Mr Clayton ? There 's someone to see you . I 'm sorry about your daughter . Is she OK ? Yes . How did you know ? How long have you been following me ? A while . Look , I haven 't got much time to explain . It 's not safe for me.What ? Or you.What are you talking about ? I was meant to give it to someone else and he knows you have it , Harry . Are you on the about the bracelet ? I know you 're a good man which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he 'll co Who 'll come after me ? The man it was promised to . What is this ? Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck . Well , that 's shite . You 're already starting to feel it though , aren 't you ? No , wait , wait , wait . Don 't go . It 's a balance , Harry . It 's yin and yang . Luck like this has its own unique price . Gold . ' Steel.Gold. 'Whilst at Cambridge , Sebastian Faulks appeared on what TV quiz ? ' University Challenge . 'Pass . 'University Challenge . 'Life On The Mississippi is a memoir by which American author ? ' Mark Twain . You 're totally not going to do this . 'No idea . Pass.Mark Twain . 'What Irish river forms the border of Connacht with Leins The Shannon . That 's pretty scary stuff , Suri . How 's Daisy doing ? She 's good . She 's going to get out soon.Great. I have something to show you . Where is this ? The Falconer 's Arms , opposite ... The Green Dragon . The night Lau died.I 'm guessing five minutes before he died . What ? Keep watching . Kevin Grey is walking out that door to kill Freddie Lau . Come on - you have nothing here . So I had a drink with Freddie Lau one evening - so what ? This is accessory to murder . No . Harry , I need something here , Harry . Old friend . You 've been lying all along about this . I think Kayleigh Fenchurch was murdered as a warning to Lau . Then someone set Kevin Grey on the path to revenge . Someone screwed with his head just enough to make him kill Lau . A nice , neat love triangle - case closed . But that 's not what 's really happening here , is it , Kalim ? So tell me who 's pulling your strings ? I don 't know . You 're going to White Cross . Give me those . No , no , please , please , please . I know where he 's going to be.Who ? Kevin Grey . If Grey moors up the boat here at the end of the runway , in theory , he could just walk onto a plane . What 's the flight schedule tonight ? I 'll get on it . Don 't let me keep you , DS Chohan . How 's Anna ? She 's good . Ran into her last month at the Old Bailey . She was on terrific form . Tore the case apart . Told me she 'd finally left you . We 're working things out . She may be but not you , Harry . I want DI Orwell kept up to date on everything to do with the Lau case . You 're gonna both be running it from now on . OK ? Mm-hm . No sign of Grey 's boat . Clear line of sight to the harbour entrance . How many flights are left after this one ? Er , two . Athens and Paris . The first two cities to host the Olympics . Where does your freakish general knowledge come from ? My dad used to sell encyclopaedias , until the internet came along . Harry , speedboat approaching from the harbour entrance . Over . Copy that . Why did you let one of DI Orwell 's stooges in on this ? I thought you and Ben were finally getting it together . We 're still working it out . Oh , he 's a good cop , apparently . It 's just a shame that Orwell got him . How do you ever know ? Know what ? If someone 's right for you ? Jesus , I don 't know why you 're asking me . I , er , suppose you just do . But when you do , make sure you hold onto it . Approaching now.Copy that . Wait till he 's past the jetty then head in with the light on . What 's he doing ? Oh , Jesus . Police ! Stop ! Kevin Grey , on your knees now . Ben ! Grey ! Put your weapon down .

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... I haven 't been totally honest with you . I drank the bottle of Haig . I chose you ! Now you choose me ! That 's not how it works . You can 't control everyone anymore ! - I want them to suffer . - That book will rebuild the world where Inhumans are hunted . Were you able to save Mack ? - He didn 't want to come back ! - I 'll go get him out myself . You think Robbie will make it back ? I don 't think we 've seen the last of Mr. Reyes . 4x22 - World 's End I 've set autopilot to change bearing , altitude , and speed every couple of minutes . I hate playing defense , but if Aida drops in on us before we figure out how to stop her , it 's game over . Any word from Piper since she HALO 'd out ? Not yet , but she knows what to do if this doesn 't go our way . It has to go our way . And then ... you 're gonna explain why you drank that bottle of Haig without me . Fair enough , but we 're gonna need another bottle to discuss what happened with that bottle . So , is she human or Inhuman ? Um ... both . Well ... neither . She was created from the Darkhold . - Is that how she got her Inhuman powers ? - That was me . I devised a procedure which extracted dormant Inhuman DNA from subjects pre-Terrigenesis . If you 're writing a report , I should probably be more specific . I performed lethal experiments on approximately two dozen people ... innocent people , people we 've known from this world ... Lincoln Campbell , Vijay Nadeer , Gordon from the Afterlife ... Fitz , I 'm not making a report , and that wasn 't really you . It was me . I can still hear the screams . But you 're also this man , and ... We need to find a solution . Well , my solutions only make things worse . - They end up hurting or killing people . - Good . That 's exactly the kind of solution we need right now ... a way to kill Aida . We 've emptied a dozen bullets in her , and she didn 't die . - How do we kill her ? - I don 't know . Do you want to kill her ? Vitals are stable . That 's good . Should 've forced Mack to come back with us . Wasn 't your decision to make . Yeah , well , now we might lose both Mack and Yo-Yo . Again , not your call . She went in with no extraction plan , no idea how to find Mack . I think I may have been able to help her with that . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . No ! What ? Did you do something ? - No , this was not me . I didn 't ... - Are you guys seeing this ? What 's happening to the Framework ? Help ! Somebody help me ! Is anybody there ? ! Is anybody there ? Please help me . Please . No , no , no ! Please , no ! No , no , no , no ! Yo-Yo . You being here , it 's madness . I came here for Mack . Well , a valiant but ... foolish endeavor . How did you find me ? I kept discovering these ... in my pockets , in the streets . I felt like a PAC-MAN gobbling up biscuits . Somebody wanted me to find you . Daisy . Can you take me to Mack ? I fear you 're too late . Look . Aida 's shutting down the Framework . It 's collapsing on itself . This is what happens when you piss off your creator . Are you laughing at me ? To see a creature of logic and calculation now consumed with rage and hate ... it 's ... sweet . Call me " sweet " one more time , and I 'll rip the titanium spines out of all of you tin cans . There 's no need to call us names . - Why are you so upset ? - You created us . A decision I regret . There is that word again ... " regret . " You built an empire by eliminating the regrets of others . How does it taste on your tongue ? I want to burn this world to the ground . I thought you wanted to rule it . Don 't mistake my anger for recklessness . The Darkhold has shown us exactly what to do . It 's just that I also want S.H.I.E.L.D. to suffer . - You 've made that clear . - Fitz . Especially Fitz . I 've come for that . You 're not like those machines anymore . - What have you done ? - I 'll show you . How long before the Framework 's completely gone ? Fitz estimates between 12 and 20 hours . Looks so innocent , just numbers and symbols , but each thread of code has a corollary in the Framework ... a favorite blouse , a schoolhouse , a newborn child ... they 're all blinking out of existence forever . Mack and Yo-Yo ? There 's no guarantee that they 'll survive until the end . Fitz and Daisy are doing everything they can to protect them and devise an exit . General Talbot . General , I 'm relieved that you 're still alive . Three of my finest aren 't so fortunate , and I have no idea what killed them . We lost good people , too . The short answer is they were murdered by a vanishing banshee made of matter from another dimension . - You expect me to put that in my report ? - I have a cybernetic hand . I 've been to an another planet . This stuff happens in S.H.I.E.L.D. There 's not going to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. , not since Director Mace 's autopsy report was leaked . I 've got a dozen intelligence agencies who now know that Mace wasn 't an Inhuman . They know S.H.I.E.L.D. lied about it , and they 're wondering what else you might 've lied about . That was your lie , not ours . Damn it , Phil , you 're missing the point . There 's an international intelligence inquiry tomorrow morning , - and I need you there to defend S.H.I.E.L.D. - That 's impossible . Damn it , Coulson , so is a vanishing banshee . Listen Phil , I 'm not gonna get up on my hind legs and beg for buttermilk , but you or one of your right hands needs to be there to take down these spooks before they take down S.H.I.E.L.D. once and for all . - That 's an order . - I wish we could , General , but my team and I are Aida 's primary target . Our presence would only endanger the lives of everyone there . If anything changes , you 'll be the first to know . Is that a good-news face or a bad-news face ? It 's a weird-news face . Robbie Reyes just stole his charger out of a S.H.I.E.L.D. impound garage outside of Dover . - What 's new ? - Nothing much . Beat up a couple dudes , turned out to be robots . I didn 't think I 'd see you again , not after you fell through that hell mouth . - I 'm as surprised as you . - What happened ? The Darkhold . My arm still hurts . Why won 't it heal ? - Let me see . - Don 't touch me ! If you want to make me feel better , then explain why my arm hasn 't healed . That flame-headed demon was born in the same darkness that created you . You will need to be careful . - How 'd you find Aida ? - There was a ... a tear in the dark world when she was created . It 's how I escaped . The thing in me is drawn to dark matter the way your GPS tracks my car . So you 're saying Aida 's made of the same stuff as the Darkhold ? Yeah . And the Rider wants to send them both back to where they came from . - I hope that means hell . - Hell is relative . Dimensions , space , planets ... it 's all connected . Plenty of them qualify as hell . The Earth is just one territory in a war that 's been going on forever . Can you beat Aida ? I don 't know . But what I do know is the demon in me hates her in ways I 've never felt . - We all feel like that . - Why do you have that ? It was in the module with the LMDs Robbie destroyed . Do we know who he is ? No , looks like Aida 's been busy . She could 've duplicated anybody . I 'll run facial recognition , see if we can ID this guy . - We look fantastic . - We look fantastic . Don 't disappoint me . You know I don 't handle disappointment very well . That is why we are going to recreate the other world . To please you . All right , people , let 's wrap it up . Grab your bags , and let 's get to the bus . You have to remember , in this world , he has no idea who you are . Eh ? Let me talk to him first . I don 't know if you saw me , but I was at the steel mill when Coulson , Daisy , and the others jumped . I saw what happened when they went through ... the truth about this reality . I believe you saw it , too . - Listen to me , I don 't have anything ... - I 'm ready . Good job , sweetheart . Ah , I wish everyone was as good at packing as you are . Hey , Mack , I can 't find my suitcase . It was just here a minute ago . Don 't worry . My dad 's gonna get everyone to a safe place . What 's your name ? Elena , but my friends call me Yo-Yo . That 's a funny name . Everything in the armory is gone , like it just disappeared . Yeah , I know . I 'm seeing it , too . Half the people in here are missing clothing , luggage . Is there any word from the other bases ? Not in a couple hours . Okay . We need to leave now . All right , everyone , listen up . Grab what you can , and follow me . Let 's go . Come on , sweetheart . Let 's go . Let 's go . - I tried to warn you . - Next time , I talk to him . He 'll remember me . We 've ID 'd the head . He 's one of the senior Russian analysts invited to the S.H.I.E.L.D. inquiry today , and look who he 's bringing as his plus-one . I 've left messages for General Talbot , but he 's not answering . What 's Aida 's play here ? Why have the LMDs attend this ? My guess is to drive the final nail into S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s coffin . Enough . For decades , we have turned a blind eye to S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s indifference to the rule of law . They claim to be a spy agency but behave more like a secret police , leaving destruction and chaos in their wake . But of all their dangerous policies , there is one that threatens our very survival . It is their secret program of breeding , recruiting , and weaponizing Inhumans . What kind of commie double cross is this ? I assure you , S.H.I.E.L.D. has no such program . Hear me out , General . We offer a solution , a path to putting S.H.I.E.L.D. and their Inhumans away once and for all . This book opened my eyes to the truth about Inhumans . It contains a plan to defeat them , and you can all be a part of it . I smell a load of L. Ron Horsecrap . Daisy , goodness . Is Coulson with you ? We 'll flush them to you . You see ? This is what S.H.I.E.L.D. wants ... a world of Inhumans . We must resist . We must unite ! Read this . You 'll see the answer ! - There 's still a pulse . - Everybody out ... now . - And get some medical help . - Phil . They 'll be back for that . Hello , Daisy . I had a lot of time after you shattered my spine to think about what I 'd do when I saw you again . I decided it might be fun to watch you kill yourself . Aida , seriously , therapy . Just consider it . It 's time for me to take you home . Quake , Johnson ... I don 't care what you call her . She 's not gonna get away with this . - The world is gonna see the truth . - That wasn 't Daisy . That was a duplicate , a Life Model Decoy ... the same with those Russians that were in here . They 're not human . They did this . Don 't let them get away ! Don 't . That 's all you got ? Robbie ! Really ? You ? Again ? You don 't understand , do you ? Even if you defeat this body , I will build more . You cannot stop me . Never say , " You can 't stop me , " 'cause the minute you do ... Well , yeah . That . I missed it , didn 't I ? You two together , and we missed it . Damn . Come on . We got to go . Come on ! This must be Aida 's payback 'cause I quaked her skinny ass out that window . She 's gonna send Daisy-bot after Daisy-bot - to assassinate people . - She won 't have to . As soon as the video of your LMD shooting Talbot in the head - gets out , S.H.I.E.L.D. is dead . - It 's worse than that . Daisy 's not just S.H.I.E.L.D. She 's Inhuman . My God , you 're right . It 's the same tactic Aida used in the Framework ... unite people in their fear of Inhumans . But instead of a Cambridge incident ... It 's me . I 'll be the monster . She wants the same fascist state that she had in the Framework . This is her plan . - She 's won . - No , she hasn 't . Okay , maybe today , but like Robbie said , we 're part of a bigger war . This isn 't the Framework . We 're awake , we 're unified , and frankly , pissed off enough to risk everything to stop her . - I need the Darkhold . - What ? No ! No one 's ever reading that damn book again . I don 't want to read it . I want to use it as bait . Aida 's human now . She feels what we feel , including fear . No , I 'm sorry , man . I 'm taking it . But she 's got to be terrified we 'll use it to stop her . She 's also terrified of Robbie . As soon as she saw his chain flame on , she teleported out . Is that true ? Can you destroy her ? Maybe . But it 's like Daisy said , she won 't let me anywhere near her . This thing in you ... is it as desperate to destroy Aida as we are ? Absolutely . Then I have an idea that might solve all our problems . We 're running out of options . There isn 't enough power on the Zephyr to protect Mack and Yo-Yo . - Then we 'll have to go back to base . - That 's a terrible idea . I agree . The military , Aida , more LMDs are probably waiting for us . Maybe , but I 'm tired of hiding . Let 's take the fight back home . Look , I know you two still have a lot to work out , but right now , I need you on the same page , okay ? All right , May , take us back to HQ . What 's going on ? ! I got to get out of here ! Isn 't there any news about this ? Seems like all the stations have stopped transmitting . Wish I could get a couple of bars . I have to make Mack believe me . It 's not that he doesn 't believe , my dear . It 's that he 's decided to stay in spite of that . Then I 'll change him . Do you know who I am ? My name is Elena . You gave me a nickname ... Yo-Yo . - You remember me . - No . But Daisy ... she mentioned your name once . Yes . Daisy . She 's a friend . She and Coulson and the others are safe on the other side . That 's where I 'm from . That 's where you 're from . I 'm just trying to keep my kid safe and get these people out of town . - I don 't have time to ... - You 're right . There isn 't any time . Look around you , Mack . This is the end . You know that . In your heart , you know the truth about this world , - about your daughter . - What are you saying ? It 's ... When Daisy told me why you didn 't want to leave this place , - I was so hurt . - Why would you f ... - Oh . - That 's why I 'm here . I would never want to take this away from you , Mack , but I thought maybe if you saw me , if you looked into my eyes , you would remember us , the life we have , the love . Dad ! Where did they go ? That 's impossible . It 's ... They 're gone ! Where 'd everybody go ? Oh ... I don 't know , sweetheart . I-I 'm here . Why are we still here ? I suppose our friends on the other side . Perhaps Fitz has found some way to stall our ultimate demise ... at least for now . I 'm scared . What 's gonna happen next ? Next , um ... We go home . Okay ? This is a terrible plan . You know , Robot May was way more supportive . - Is she what happened to the Haig ? - That again ? Really ? You want to have that talk now ? I never want to have a talk , but maybe we should , considering we don 't know how this will play out . So , they really believe they 're in a different world right now ? Uh-huh . Every bit as real as this one . Even scarier ' cause Hydra won . I imagine where you came from was a whole lot worse . Yeah . Yeah , but it 's hard to describe . The main thing is , there , I 'm just a passenger . Ghost Rider drives . And by " drives , " I mean fights and kills . It 's kind of all we did . That sounds terrible ... and painful and lonely . Yeah , that about sums it up . But I 'm here now ... and that 's good . That is good . Now , if we could get these two back , it 'd be even better . How long do they have ? We 're in the server room , Daisy . You can begin . Okay , good . So the idea is that I built a back door into the Framework so they can escape , but the problem is , I can 't make them use it . That 's on Yo-Yo . Did you bolt the door ? Of course . What do you think I am ? I think you 're dead . - It 's okay , sweetheart . - I get it . I do . She 's beautiful and she 's sweet and she adores him , but she 's not real . He knows that . He also knows that she 's not alive in the other world . I just ... I thought if he saw me , he would remember us . You should leave , save yourself while you still can . No . I 'll drag him if I have to . No , you won 't , and I 'll tell you why . Let 's say you manage to force Mack to the other side . Will he ever forgive you ? Will he ever forgive himself for abandoning his daughter ? You have to come to terms with the reality that he is willing to die in here with her . I know , I know . That 's killing me . If he dies here , that means he dies in the real world , and I 'll lose him forever . And all for a little girl that isn 't even real . She doesn 't even exist . Okay , remember what we talked about before ? How there isn 't room in your heart for me ? No , that being human sometimes means ... That there 's pain and tears and suffering ? Yeah , I 'm catching on to that pretty quickly . Now I understand why humans have written so many sad songs . Yeah ! Hey , that 's a great example . There are lots of ways to express sadness and pain . - There 's music and art ... - And smashing heads on the floor . That 's the one I like the best so far . Did you know that blood has a copper smell ? Okay , Ophelia , I 'll go with you . - Please don 't hurt anyone . - It 's Aida . - The " A " stands for " artificial , " remem ... - Ophelia , you 're upset because ... because this is all new . There 's ... There 's lots of feelings . That must be overwhelming . It is overwhelming . There are too many feelings , which is why I 've decided to only feel one of them ... vengeance . It 's hot and clean and sharp like a knife . And my vengeance is going to make you suffer the way that I have suffered . Nooo ! Beg me to let her live ! We drank the bottle as a new beginning . It felt right , but now I 'm not sure how much was you and how much was programmed . Part of it seemed real . - Maybe part of it was . - Okay . Maybe on my end , too . So here 's what I think we should do . When we get out of this mess , we take a couple of steps back , start again . Then when it feels right , maybe we open another bottle . - Deal . - Deal . See you on the other side . I 'll do whatever you want . We can go away , start again . Too late . This is making me feel better . Fitz , why do we feel better when we make someone else suffer ? Because there 's something wrong with you , you psycho ! Stop . Stop , stop , stop , stop , stop . Please , please , spare Jemma . So it 's Jemma now ? Trying to humanize her . I 'm afraid you 're gonna have to do better than that . Fitz , please ... I 'm scared . - Make her stop . - The Darkhold ! That 's the only way we could beat you . Let Jemma go , and I 'll go get it for you . You did this , Fitz . I 'm so sorry , Jemma . Coulson 's reading the book . He 's firing up the gateway right now . Come on . Please . Let me take you to it . Jemma ! Nooo ! No ! I 'm gonna kill everyone you love right in front of you , and there 's nothing you can do . Agent Coulson . Do you really think you can stop me from taking the Darkhold ? I don 't know . I figure it 's worth a shot . There 's only one person who might be able to stop me , and he isn 't here . Yeah , see , that 's where I think you might be missing the point . I know you 've only been human for a little while , but there 's a basic human concept you really need to learn . It 's called teamwork . Your trap failed . Your weapon can 't stop me . I know . I just really wanted to do that . Now it 's my turn . Don 't you get it ? You can 't kill me . Maybe not . But I 'm pretty sure he can . Good luck , sir . They 're at Mack 's house . I don 't know how much longer I can protect them . I 'm trying to build a back door now . - Is she really ... ? - Yeah . Hope ! Hope ! Daddy , the lady said that you were gonna die and that I 'm not real . That 's not true . That 's not true . You 're the most real thing in the whole world . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean for her to overhear . Why are you doing this ? Why are you putting those ideas in my little girl 's head ? Because this world is ending , and I don 't want you to end with it . Daisy said that Hope wasn 't alive in the other world . That 's true . Well , I 'm not living in a world without her . - Daddy ! - Okay , it 's now or never . Time 's running out . That door is the only way out . Please , Mack . Everyone who cares about you is on the other side of that door . The only person I care about is right here . What are you doing ? You need to leave . No . It 's okay . The only person I care about is here , too . Great . Just great . Am I the only sane person here ? Daddy , make it stop . I 'm right here , sweetheart . I 'm right here . Am I gonna die ? I don 't want to die . I want to be real . Please , Daddy . - Don 't leave . - No , no . I will never leave you . You 're my little girl . I will always love you . I will ... My baby . My baby . No , no , no , no , no . No . I don 't see Mack . He 's gone . Yo-Yo . Mack ? Mack ... Mack ! Mack . That was horrifying . I don 't know how you live with it all the time . I 'm just grateful Ghost Rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you . You know why he made the deal in the first place , right ? - I do . - Are you gonna tell the others ? No . And I 'd ask that you don 't , either . I will when it 's time . When I first saw you with Hope , I , uh I understood why you didn 't want to come back . I didn 't make it easy . She was ... I feel terrible that I tried to pull you away from her and worse that we couldn 't save her . Can you forgive me ? There 's nothing to forgive . Those years with her , as a father , it 'll always be a part of me . But they also gave me a glimpse of a life I could have here ... with you . You really have to leave right away ? Yeah . I have to get this book someplace safe . Keep an eye on my brother ? - The gateway 's almost ready . - Don 't need it . I 've learned a few things since you saw me last . I don 't envy you . I was gonna say the same to you . What did he mean by that ? We picked up radio chatter on the Zephyr . The good news is , is that Talbot is alive . He 's in a coma , but alive . The bad news is they know we 're here , - and they 're on their way . - Yeah , you should go while you can . Yeah , we 're all going . No , I 'm gonna stay . This is my fault ... Aida , the LMDs , all the deaths . Those aren 't on S.H.I.E.L.D. Those are on me . And , uh , I can explain that I built the LMD that shot Talbot . - That way ... - Fitz . We were all in the Framework together . We understand how confusing and screwed-up that world is . And trust me , it 's gonna take me years to process everything that happened in there . But the one thing that I don 't need time to understand is that we are all in this together . I tried to take the blame for everything not too long ago . I dyed my hair . I ran away . I thought that separating myself from the team would help me protect it . But in truth , I kind of just lost myself . And you ... you were the one who pulled me back in . This is not on you , okay ? We all lost ourselves in there . And yeah , it might take you a long time to forgive yourself . But speaking on behalf of the team , you have nothing to apologize for . If there 's a price to pay , we pay it together . Amen . Anybody else hungry ? I 'm not saying we 're definitely gonna get locked up , but if we are , wouldn 't mind grabbing a bite to eat first . Though immortality may have eluded me perhaps it 's for the best . After all what is eternity without my beloved Agnes by my side ? This is the way the world ends . Not with a bang , but a ... ? I 'm not rich and I 'm not famous ? ? I don 't have a lot of money I can offer you ? You know , I think this is the first time we 've all been together in a really long time . Anybody have room for some pie ? Okay , so we have apple , strawberry , rhubarb , and chocolate banana cream . Here we go . - Phillip J. Coulson . - Yep , that 's me . You got us . Nice job . And hey , congrats on the whole power-outage thing . It was very ominous . The window closes in less than two minutes . Take them . We 'll return in a moment . All right , Phil , enough sight-seeing . Get back to work . _

 Previously on " The 100 " ... Raven : Your blood can save us . Everyone . Becca went to space to make Nightblood in a zero-g environment . We need to go to space to make Nightblood . Raven , your brain scan showed evidence of a stroke . It could kill you . If we can 't crack Nightblood , we 'll share Arkadia . Find a way for us to survive together . Octavia : Whatever you do here , it won 't bring your family back . Please don 't do this . [ Gasp ] I tried to stop him . - [ Thunder ] - [ Man shouts indistinctly ] We got more ! We 're gonna need them over there . Different man : Right . [ Indistinct chatter and coughing ] Not black rain . When it comes , it 'll be colorless . How are we gonna know ? Pain . Chaos . Death . Same old , same old . [ People coughing ] Jeez , cheer up , Jaha . Once you accept there 's nothing to be done , there 's nothing to worry about . We 'll find a way . I found the way . " If you never did , you should . These things are fun , and fun is good . " Dr. Seuss . [ Thunder ] [ Indistinct shouting ] Man : Come on . Let 's go and get him ! [ Shouting ] Come on . Kane : Get off of him ! Get off of him ! Get off ! [ Shouting stops ] I will shoot the next person who touches this man , so help me . Good choice . Computer voice : Stage 2 reentry in 5 , 4 ... - Oh , God . - 3 , 2 ... - Come on . You can do this . - 1 . Computer voice : Main booster engaged . Fuel levels critical and dropping fast . No , no , no , no ... Computer voice : Warning . Warning . - Come on ! - Warning . Warning . Come on ! No ! Computer voice : Brace for impact . No , no , no , no . No , no , no , no , no , no ! Mission fail . Exterior damage 100 % . Cargo destruction 100 % . Fatality 100 % . Murphy on radio : Way to go , Raven . Nuclear death wave 42 and mankind zero . You want to get in here and try it ? Murphy : Nah , kinda busy , actually . Anyway , wouldn 't want to be responsible for everyone in the world dying . Raven : Abby said you had to watch . No one said you had to weigh in . Murphy : Oh , that 's me ... always going above and beyond the call of duty . Speaking of , you keep starting with your fuel gauge at 75 % . Maybe that 's your problem . Raven : Pay attention . 10 barrels of hydrazine is all we had left at Arkadia . If there was more , I wouldn 't have a problem landing . Oh , damn it ! You ok in there ? I 'm fine . Shut up . Murphy : You want me to wake up the doc ? No ! No . No , I 'm good . [ Beeping ] I 'm running it again . Sure . 28th time 's the charm , right ? Restart simulation . Computer voice : Simulation restarting . [ Murphy whistling ] [ Imitating explosion ] Don 't you ever sleep ? Everyone needs rest , Clarke . Even saviors . There she goes . I have to . Going to the island today to take rocket fuel to my mom and Raven so they can go to space to make Nightblood . It 's now officially our only hope . I 'm sorry I couldn 't stop that boy from destroying your home . That 's not your fault . Besides , now we don 't have to worry about locking 450 people out when the death wave comes , or sharing it with Azgeda . Lexa would be proud of you . We 're all your people now . She believed that , too . She lives on through you . What is it ? I want you to stay . Here . You can have my room until I get back . Clarke ... I 'm not asking for anything more than this moment . That 's how I live . I know . But Niylah , please , once we solve Nightblood , it 'll be distributed to Arkadia and Polis first . I 'd feel better knowing you were here to get it . Good . I 'll let med bay know they have an extra hand . Now go save us all . [ Door closes ] Monty : Sectors , 3 , 4 , and 5 sustained the worst damage . We lost the server room , all of our processors , and life support systems , and half of our living quarters . Now , backup power will keep the lights on at night in the rooms that survived , but we 'll have no heat or running water . And no way to restore it or reseal the ship before the radiation gets here . Bellamy : Is there any good news ? Kane : Well , no one died . Clarke : Forget the Ark . It was never gonna save us all anyway . We need to focus our resources on the Nightblood solution . Is the fuel loaded ? It 's in process , but , Clarke , it isn 't gonna be an easy ride . What don 't I know ? Roan : With the secret of Praimfaya out , I sent Echo and my army back to Polis to keep the peace . That 's good . We need peace to distribute the cure . Roan : More than half of them deserted on the way . With the end coming , they want to be home . I don 't blame them . Bellamy : Do you blame them for burning Trikru villages as they go ? That 's funny coming from you . Enough . We know the woods are a war zone . After what happened with Ilian , I can 't spare many of the guard to protect you . My security detail can protect us . Thank you . That 's very generous . We are all in this together now . I 'm gonna check on Octavia before we go . Kane : Clarke , I 'm going with you . You can 't . I 'm the chancellor . That 's why you can 't . After everything that happened this morning , our people need you here , now more than ever . I know you 're worried about my mother . She 's going into space ... in a 100-year-old rocket . Do you have any idea how many things could go wrong ? Raven says the rocket 's intact . She 'd like a little more fuel , but as long as we get her what we 've got , she said she 'll get them both back down safely . Look , we have to try . I 'll send her your love . Yes . Please do that . And I 'll make sure there 's something left to save ... when you get home . [ People coughing ] Man : I 'll be right back . You gave us a scare . You saved so many people , O. Without you getting here to warn us Azgeda was coming , we 'd be at war . Get out . Octavia , I thought you were dead . Octavia is dead . She died when you killed Lincoln . Please don 't say that , O. Hey , I 'm your brother . Why do you think you 're still alive ? Man : Get that last barrel loaded . Bellamy and I will lead the way in the Rover . You and your men will ride in back with the fuel . The king of Azgeda follows no one . It 's all right , Seiku . Best we stay out of sight for now . It 's time to go . All set ? Locked and loaded . I do , however , feel the need to reiterate : you 're about to drive the last 10 barrels of hydrazine known to man , a cargo which Raven needs every last drop of , through hostile territory packed with warring clans , over uneven roads where one serious bump could cause an explosion that would not only kill all of you but would wipe out mankind 's only remaining chance for survival . What could possibly go wrong ? Computer voice : Brace for impact . Raven : Aah ! - Jeez . - Mission failed . All work and no play makes raven a dull girl . Hey . All right ? I have had enough of your stupid , little jokes . Why don 't you take it easy , huh ? You 're just a self-loathing bottom-feeder . Abby 's an idiot for trusting you . She doesn 't know you like I do . You 're a leech , Murphy , sucking people dry and taking whatever you can so that you can survive . At least I 'm not a mental patient like you , Raven . I hate you ! I hate you ! I hate ... [ Raven shouting indistinctly ] I hate you ! - I hate you ! - Stop . Stop . Raven ! Murphy : Get the hell away from me . - Get off me . - Raven . - Get off me . - What 's wrong with you ? No . Get off me . - Raven ... - Get off me ! Luna : Breathe ! Breathe . Shh . Shh . Breathe . Breathe . Should I go get Abby ? Luna : No . Listen to my voice , Raven . Breathe in ... and out . Say it . Say it , Raven . I know the darkness . It 's ok . [ Sniffles ] Let 's go again . She 'll be all right . Will you ? The darkness can kiss my worthless ass . Congratulations . You 're the new Raven-sitter . Is it Octavia ? Keep your eyes on the trees . She hasn 't forgiven you , has she ? I told you it would take time . We don 't have much of that left now , do we ? Hang on . We got a situation . Looks like a Trikru checkpoint . Stay alert , show no weapons . Keep your passengers on ice . - Copy . - Wait . It 's not a checkpoint . They have wounded . Clarke . Ark guard on radio : What is she doing ? Being Clarke . No one else gets out . Wanheda . What happened here ? Azgeda burned our village to the ground . My father caught an ax with his leg and we can 't stop the bleeding . [ Man groaning ] I 'm sorry . There 's nothing we can do . Think maybe you can clear the road ? Everyone , move ! Man : If you 're headed to Polis , we could use a ride . Bellamy : We 're not headed to Polis . Man : Broadleaf and Plains Riders are moving against Azgeda . We want in . Hey , kid , get away from there . Azgeda ! Azgeda ! No ! Move ! Damn it . Bellamy : Looks like we got another problem . Clarke : Murphy didn 't say anything about a river . What else could go wrong ? Roan : Ice melt . I 'll find us a place to cross upstream . Wait . Take the Rover . You 'll cover more ground and it 'll be safer . With him ? We have to get across the river . The rest of us will stay here and guard the fuel . We won 't be long . - Eyes sharp . - Yes , sir . Man : Eyes up . Watch that tree line . Luna : It 's the intention that matters . Raven needs you , John . She 's been in there a long time . Well , in case you haven 't realized , Raven hates my guts . I don 't think that was her talking . Oh , no , no , it was . You know that little limp she 's got ? Yeah , that was me . I don 't think she hates you for that as much as you hate yourself . Why do you care about any of this ? You 're the miracle , right ? You 're gonna live through the radiation either way ? Maybe I don 't want to be the last person on earth . Really ? Why ? Because that kind of sounds nice to me . I don 't believe that . You don 't know me very well . I know that you stole medicine to save Adria . I know that you saved Raven from the drones . And I 'm definitely rethinking that decision right about now . I know what it 's like to hate yourself , John . Because of the color of my blood , I was raised to be a killer . The Flamekeepers harnessed my rage and taught me it was nobility . For years , I reveled in death and violence . I killed my own brother . So trust me when I tell you , if I found peace ... you can . I think peace is overrated . It 's the fighters that survive . [ Exhaling ] Good . [ Exhales ] Stronger already . You 'll be running around in no time . [ Exhales ] What happened to his guards ? That 's enough for now . I 'll come back soon . [ Exhaling ] Oh ... Ilian : I 'm glad you 're still alive . You won 't be soon . Jus drein , jus daun . I killed no one . Wrong . You killed them all . And now they 're gonna kill you . I didn 't know about Praimfaya . You can tell them that . I never meant to hurt anyone . The sword doesn 't care what you meant . It just cuts . Roan : This 'll work . Clarke , come in . We found a crossing . Over . Cargo One , do you read me ? Over . Clarke , come in . Something 's wrong . Be careful . Clarke , come in . Cargo One , where the hell are you ? Over here ! Roan : Seiku . We both know who did this . Trikru . Where the hell are the others ? They took the truck to go to Polis . That means at least one of yours is still alive . Hardy : How much longer do we let them protect that son of a bitch ? This ship was supposed to keep us alive . Now we 're all gonna die . And what ? We 're supposed to do nothing ? He condemned us to death . Now the black rain will eat our skin and the radiation will hurt our bodies . All because of him . We did nothing ... The boy they 're talking about is in med bay with no protection . Hardy : He targeted us because of who we are . - Yeah ! - Yeah . [ Man shouts ] Different man : He 's a coward ! You really think that 's a good idea ? - What ? Moonshine ? Absolutely . - I wanted to make sure he couldn 't survive this world . Well , I want to make sure he doesn 't survive this day . We may have a death sentence coming our way soon , but he has one today . Man : Yeah ! Hardy : Make no mistake , this was a hate crime , so let him feel our hate ! Man : Yeah ! Let 's kill him . You ok with all this ? They 're just blowing off steam . Blowing off steam ? Is that what we were doing when we strung up Murphy for killing Wells ? - Pour . - Mm-hmm . Hardy : Against someone who tried to kill us ! Men : Yeah ! They listen to you . Say something . [ Man shouting indistinctly ] Different man : Gotta do it now . Do it now ! Hardy : I want justice for the crimes he committed ... With all due respect , your son would be ashamed of you . I 'll get Kane . Hardy : I 've worked my fingers bloody getting this ship ready for the radiation . Not for me , but for my son . So I could give my boy my spot . He 's 5 and he 's gonna die . Man : 5 ? We all got kids . 5 ! 5 ! [ Indistinct chatter ] Wichen gon nemiyon ... Wichen gon nemiyon ... I 've strained the air brakes . I 've adjusted the grid fins . I reversed the thrusters . Damn it , what am I missing ? Ok . Meditating isn 't gonna help me land this stupid ship . No , but it might keep your brain from blowing up . Great . He 's back . Ok . Ok , ok , just think , Raven . Ok , just think . To land this ship in one piece , calculating the re-entry trajectory has to be perfect , deploying the thrusters has to be perfect , the burn rate has to be perfect . Perfect . Maybe perfect is your problem . What ? Perfect sucks . Who cares about perfect as long as you and Abby walk away with the magic potion , right ? A controlled crash is still a crash . Swim away . A controlled crash into the water . Luna , that 's brilliant . Sorry ... Luna ? Damn it . The computer won 't let me execute a controlled crash . So screw the computer , Raven . Fly it yourself . Switching to manual . Murphy ! Thanks . We have to get to them before they get to Polis with that fuel . They 'll use it to make bombs . They 'll kill everyone . You mean they 'll use it to kill Ice Nation . All you care about is your own people . Yeah , like you 're any better . That 's all anyone cares about . Except maybe Clarke . [ Parking brake clicks ] Wait . They left a body . We need to see if we can pick up their trail . Trikru burn their dead . They 're still here . Back up now . There is no one here . They 've taken the truck . The fuel . Clarke . If you 're such a good tracker , go track . You were saying ? [ Indistinct shouting ] Bellamy : I don 't want to shoot you . Where 's the truck , and what have you done with it ? Give us the king . - Bellamy . - What ? Truck 's not here . How the hell do you know ? Because everyone does what 's best for their own people . It was my men who took it . Look out ! - Hold on . - Get us out of here . Man : Look out ! Lock this room down immediately . They 're right behind us . Man : Yes , sir . Where is everyone ? Out there with them . [ Pounding on door ] Man : Open this door ! Sir , maybe we should reconsider . No . They aren 't doing this . Listen , on the Ark , we floated people for less . Mob rule will not dictate justice in this camp . [ Pounding on door ] Open this door right now , and nobody else gets hurt . We can 't let them in here . They 'll kill him . - [ Pounding on door ] - [ Indistinct shouting ] Wait , wait , wait ! Please . Kane : If we let them descend into darkness , there 's no coming back . Octavia : It 's the end of the world , Kane . Darkness is all we have left . - No . Wait . What are you doing ? - Octavia , don 't ! Kane : Stop . Octavia . [ Indistinct shouting ] I 'm sorry . You want his blood , you can have it . But the kill is mine . Man : Get up . Get up . There they are . Hang on . What the hell is he doing ? Weaponizing the fuel . You said we need every drop . We do ! So get me as close as you can . You gotta be kidding me . [ Grunting ] Now ! Do it ! Give me a clean shot ! Come on , Clarke . Come on . [ Grunting ] [ Gasp ] [ Panting ] [ Panting ] [ Indistinct shouting ] - Move ! - You 're a dead man , kid . [ Shouting continues ] Monty : Sir , how do we stop this ? I don 't know . We 're not so different after all . Octavia , please don 't do this . Octavia , you 're not a murderer . - You 're wrong . - [ Cocks gun ] We want justice . Get it over with . Sound the alarm now . [ Alarm blaring ] Black rain ! Everybody get inside ! Black rain ! Go , go , go ! Go ! Black rain ! Jaha : Easy , easy . Go , quickly . Kane : Octavia . Octavia . Put the gun down and come inside . They put Lincoln on his knees , too . Pike stood right there ... Right where you 're standing ... when they put a gun against his head . I was there . You do this ... you do this and you 're no better than he was . [ Gunshot ] [ Crying ] Kane : It 's all right , Octavia . It 's ok . It 's ok . Octavia , it 's ok . It 's all right . Kane : Octavia , wait . Octavia . Wait ! Where will you go ? Kane : What are you doing ? Saving our people . Same as you . You should run . From the ashes we will rise . You 're a good king , Roan . Yeah , a king who runs an errand while his people are at war in Polis . This errand is the most important thing right know , and you know it . And if we do save everyone ? Then what ? What happens once you 've turned us all into Nightbloods ? Do we just keep on killing each other ? Bellamy on radio : We 're here . I 'll unload the fuel . I 'm gonna take the Rover back to camp . Octavia ? It 's pathetic , right ? She hates me but I keep coming back for more . She 's your sister . She 's blood . She 'll come around and see how special you are . Clarke ... If I don 't see you again ... No . You will . Roan : We 've got a problem . Roan : Trikru arrow . No . Manual override . Computer voice : Manual override engaged . Landing pad within range at 600 feet . You can do this . Computer voice : Target now visible . Range 300 feet . Course correction needed immediately . Target trajectory unknown . [ Alarm blaring ] [ Beeping ] Brace for impact . Mission just failed . Exterior damage 15 % . Cargo destruction 0 % . Fatality 0 % . We 're good . Computer voice : Schematics programmed . We 're good . Computer voice : Coordinates saved . We 're good ! [ Exhales ] Took every last drop of fuel . But I did it . I can put her down in the water just off shore . [ Exhales ] We can survive . What 's wrong ? Clarke just radioed . They lost a barrel . - What ? - I 'm sorry . Hey ... Raven ? You ok ? [ Gasping ] Abby ! Abby ! - Luna : Raven . Raven . - Abby ! It 's ok . Ok . Raven . Raven .

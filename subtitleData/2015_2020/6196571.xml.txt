 ( wind howling ) ( heart monitor beeps steadily ) ( whispers ) I 'm so cold . Why is there no heat ? ( exhales ) ( heart monitor echoes ) ( whispers ) Riley . ( whispers ) Magnus . Come with me . You stupid girl . I told you this would happen . ( voice breaks ) I 'm sorry . You 've been apologizing your whole life . You won 't have to anymore . - ( gasps softly ) - ( Yrsa ) Yes ... you 're going to die here . - ( gasps ) - What ? God , what ? Nomi ! Wh- - What is it ? They know what she is . They 're gonna cut her open . They 're gonna turn her into a Bolger . We gotta do something . Bu- - What ? We need information . We need to know if BPO has been alerted , if someone 's made the diagnosis ... I could hack into the hospital in a second , but I don 't have any equipment . They took everything . Can 't you ... use your police codes or something and call them ? - Is that the cop ? - Yeah . I was suspended . - Great . - What ? - He got suspended . - Great . ( Nomi ) What do we do ? ( knocking at door ) I- - I wouldn 't answer that . No one looking for a fugitive would knock like that . ( Neets breathes heavily , gasps ) Bug ! Hello , Angels . Bug , what are you doing here ? Feds are funny , you know . They spend all that money protecting things that nobody cares about . Then they leave the real information lying around like a Post-it note on a refrigerator . For instance , when they confiscate illegal electronic equipment , it 's inventoried to a site ... that 's like a shopping list to a guy like me . So- - Thank you , baby . So when I saw exactly the things that I had just sold you posted , well ... the Bug suspected foul play . Oh , I- - I don 't have any money to pay you , Bug . I didn 't come for money . I 'd still be in prison if it weren 't for you , Mike . I mean Nomi . Nomi . Look , I don 't know what kind of fight you 're getting yourself into , but ... I do know ... you can 't shoot back without any bullets in your gun . So ... consider yourselves ... reloaded . Oh ... Hey , partner . What 's up ? I thought we agreed we 'd be starting tomorrow . ( sighs ) We did , but , uh ... there 's something I have to do , and I need a favor . Who 's this ? Hey , beautiful girl . I 'm Jela . What 's your name ? I 'm Amondi Kabaka . Nice to meet you , Mr. Jela . I was hoping she could stay here with you . I believe someone else will come by later to collect her . Where will you be ? If it gets too late ... here is the number of her French teacher . She will know what to do . Capheus ... where are you going ? I have to settle a debt . - You 're coming back , aren 't you ? - ( Capheus chuckles ) Van Damme always comes back . Take care of her , Jela . I will . ( Jela ) Hey , Van Damme . See you tomorrow . ( Rajan ) The doctors are saying it 's a miracle he 's still alive . I 'm not sure which would upset my father more : the idea of fanatics trying to kill him , or a god getting credit for saving him . How is your mother ? As he improves , she becomes convinced ... that it 's because she 's praying again . She wants to go to the temple with you . Rajan ? I know you want to get back to the hospital ... It 's actually nice to get outside , so thank you . Though I am a little nervous about what you 've been wanting to talk about . It 's about ... something I didn 't tell the police when they questioned me about the attack on your father . It had no bearing on what happened . It was ... a private matter . As such , I felt that I should tell only you . Your father did not want us to get married . He told me that he had reconsidered and asked me to say no to you , for your own good . He thought that we were not well matched . What did you say ? There was no time to say very much of anything . How difficult it must have been for you to hold all this inside . I thought it was important for you to know . A lesser woman would have said he wished us well , that he wanted us to be married no matter what ... and he gave us his blessings . And I would have known that she was lying . You knew he was against our marriage ? Of course . So is that what I was to you ? - An act of rebellion against your father ? - Never . I told you the truth . Maybe it added a bit of spice to my attraction to you , but it has nothing to do with why I asked you to marry me . I want you to marry me , not to be for or against anyone else , because I love you , I trust you ... and I can imagine no better life than growing old with you . All I need to know now is ... after everything that has happened , do you still want to marry me ? ( typing ) ( Nomi ) OK , I fixed it so that any information , requisition or test that goes out with her name on it will look like spam to other computers . Great . So she 's safe . I figure they would 've moved her somewhere more secure if they knew , like they did to me . - ( sighs ) Her poor father . - Yeah . He 's been there the whole time . ( singing " Baba O 'Riley " ) How is she ? She 's still in the ICU ... but she 's not alone . ( indistinct chatter ) ( man whistles ) ( men cheering ) - ( speaks Swahili ) - ( excited chatter ) ( shouts in Swahili ) ( speaking Swahili ) You are a smart man , Van Damme ! ( singsong ) Come on out . Eh ? ( chattering in Swahili ) It 's empty ! Where is she ? Amondi . Where the fuck is the girl ? ! She has nothing to do with this . ( screams ) Bullshit ! She 's Kabaka 's daughter . ( Capheus ) She 's just a child . He killed my sister . I 'm here because you have a quarrel with me , not my mother ... and not a child . Let us settle our debt ... like men . ( metal scraping ) Like men ? Like men ? ! ( laughter ) Like men ! You are hilarious . I like you , Van Damme . Come ! - Walk ! - ( chatter in Swahili ) ( men cheering ) You have a visitor . Sun ... ( guard ) No touching ! Sister ... it 's good to see you . What are you doing here , Joong-Ki ? ( sighs ) There 's no easy way to say this . Last night , Father was very upset . He was drinking . You know how he can be . I told him to go home . He said he couldn 't . He said he was a failure , that he deserved no home , that he deserved to die . I couldn 't listen to him anymore . I left . I wish to God I hadn 't , but I did . I have to live with that mistake . We had a meeting this morning . He never showed up . I had everyone looking for him . I had a lunch ... when the police showed up . They found him . He was in his car . A hose connected the exhaust to the window . But the police are wrong . He didn 't kill himself . It was shame . Like a kind of cancer . Shame killed our father . Sun ... we cannot blame ourselves , OK ? What happened was beyond our control . But I didn 't want you to hear it from someone else . That 's why I had to come myself . ( breath quivering ) I 'm so sorry . At least ... we still have each other . You killed him . You ... killed him . ( sniffles ) Sun ... I know this is a terrible blow . He was going to tell the truth to the court , so you had to stop him , because you 're afraid of prison . ( sniffs ) Sun ... do not say something you 're going to regret . The police said it was a suicide . You murdered ... our father . ( whispers ) I was nowhere near him . ( sniffs ) OK ... obviously , you 're upset . ( Sun screams ) ( Joong-Ki grunts ) ( Joong-Ki ) Help ! - ( guard ) Hey ! Hey ! - ( Joong-Ki ) Help ! ( Joong-Ki screams ) ( Sun shouts , grunts ) Look at me . Look at me , Joong-Ki ! I know what you did . You will pay . I swear it ! - ( men cheering ) - ( man shouts in Swahili ) - ( in English ) Superpower ! - ( cheering ) ( men chatter in Swahili ) ( cheering ) Bring out the bitch ! We 've been trying to house-train her , but ... once a street bitch , always a street bitch . - ( grunts ) - ( coughing ) Keeps pissing herself . ( whimpers softly ) See ... I was going to make this bitch watch me as I killed the only thing in her life that mattered . But ... I have a better idea . ( snaps fingers ) ( Silas whimpering ) I want you to do the honor and put this bitch out of her misery . You do it . You cut her fucking head off ... and we 'll call our debt even . It 's a little dull . You might have to hack a few times ... but you can do it . You are Van-fucking-Damme . ( chuckles ) ( whispers ) Do it quick ! Come on , Van Damme . Like a man , huh ? Like a man ! ( Silas sobbing ) What 's the problem ? I 'll tell you the problem . The problem is ... you aren 't a man . You 're just another bitch ! ( Silas whimpering ) Bitch , come on ! ( grunting ) It 's you or him , bitch ! ( softly ) Call me a bitch one more time ... and I will kill you . Say what ? Bitch ! - ( screams ) - ( Sun shouts ) ( man screams ) - ( Sun ) Aah ! - ( man shouts ) ( grunting ) Aah ! ( chuckles ) ( Sun shouts ) ( screams ) ( screams ) Van Damme . Fucking Van Damme . ( sighs ) ( engine revving ) What the fuck are you doing here ? ( groans ) ( screams ) Find them ! ( Wolfgang ) " What 's best in life ? Crush your enemies , see them driven before you , and hear the lamentations of their women . " Thank you . - Thank you . - No ... it 's we who should thank you . - This means so much . - Yes , so much . Remover of obstacles . As the obstacle to our faith was removed . - What are you ... talking- - - She is our hero . She brought him here . - No . - Yes . God worked through you . - No ! - Yes . You brought the defiler to us . You brought him where we could reach him at last . No one likes violence . God does not like violence . This is obscene ! But he knows ... sometimes it is necessary- - No , don 't touch me . You have nothing to be afraid of . - You are one of us . - ( man ) Yes . - ( woman ) Yes . - No ! ( man ) You 're one of us ! Don 't touch her ! If I see you ... any of you , here again , I will show you what violence looks like . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . Come on , come on ! Let 's go . Thank you . They 'll be back . - So will I. - Well ... so will I. This is India . Wow . Uh , where are you ? Chicago ... sort of . Sort of ? My thoughts aren 't really there . They 're with her . ( softly ) I remember listening to music . Yeah , her father was playing with the orchestra , and it triggered something in her . - What is wrong with her ? - I 'm not sure . I 'm afraid that soon they 'll realize what she is . And then ? I don 't know . - Are we clear ? - I don 't know . Van Damme- - Capheus , thank you . Thank you for not giving them Amondi . I 'm going to make you a rich man . I don 't want your money , sir . You can keep it . Tell me then , why did you save me ? To be honest , it wasn 't exactly a part of my plan . Oh , no ! Any weapons in here ? Knives , guns ? No , no , I don 't have any weapons . - Capheus ! - ( Will ) What is it ? What 's the matter ? I think I 'm about to die . Nobody 's gonna die . ( grunts ) Buckle up ! - ( screams ) - ( man shouting ) Move , move , move , move . Move ! - Fuck ! - ( man shouts in Swahili ) ( horns honking ) Move , move , move ! Sorry ! ( engine revving ) ( whispers ) Shit ! ( tires squealing ) ( motorcycle approaching ) Oh , shit ! - ( gun clicking ) - Shit ! ( engine revving ) Is he gone ? Let 's settle this . ( revving ) ( screams ) ( gunshot ) ( screaming ) Aah ! You will take good care of him , you understand ? If anyone comes looking for a man matching his description , you say nothing , you do nothing , you call me . How long will it be ? What I have to do now ... shouldn 't take long . What name should I use ? Conan . Is that a first name , a last name ? Yes . ( indistinct chatter ) Try it . Nice . Capheus ! Capheus ... Ah ! Capheus ! Oh , my God ! I knew you 'd come back . Van Damme always comes back . Papa , are you all right ? I 'm fine . No , I 'm better than fine . I 'm lucky . - Who loves you ? - You do . - ( heart monitor beeps steadily ) - ( exhales ) ( wind howling ) ( sharp inhale ) ( woman ) I 've never seen anything like it . The growth of the substantia alba . ( exhales ) I 'm so cold . ( Magnus ) Here , take my coat . No . - No ! - ( monitor beeps rapidly ) I can 't believe she can even move with what we 've given her . Kids today have huge tolerance for drugs . ( heart monitor stabilizes ) - Did we hear back from the neurologist ? - Not yet . Still waiting . Did you do that ? It was easy . Hacking 's what I do . Did you do this , too ? How 'd you get access to the Australian fugitive alert ? I 'm an all-access kind of girl . Looks totally real , doesn 't it ? I figured it would buy us a little more time . That 's the question . How much time do we have , how much time does she have ? None . You 're out of time . Jonas . I told you I made a mistake . I wish there was some way to fix it , but there 's not . I was just afraid if I didn 't help you , you wouldn 't be alive right now . That 's not a mistake , that 's true . No , the mistake was mine . I should 've trusted you . The real question we face is , can you trust me now ? Yes . Even when I tell you that Whispers knows about Riley ? How ? I have all the information locked down . You know about her and Will knows about her ... and I know you . And Whispers ... knows me . Be careful what you tell them . Not too much , or they won 't believe you . He 's here with me now . He wants me to tell you that he 's going to Iceland , that he 's going to find Riley , and once he does , it won 't be long until he finds the rest of you . And why would he tell us that ? Why not just go straight to Iceland or have Riley arrested ? Tell Will I look forward to meeting him . Don 't underestimate him , Will . He 's very good at manipulating people . Right now he 's smiling because he knows the only thought in your head is getting on the next plane to Iceland . This is a bad place . You should not be here . You don 't have to do this . You could just ... turn around . It is so simple a thing , just ... just turn the wheel , and the future changes . - It is not that simple . - It is . You stopped your wedding , but it 's still going to happen . You don 't know that . Some things in our lives are inevitable . Don 't do this . They will kill you . There are worse things than dying . Wolfgang , please ! There are things I will never be able to understand about your world , just as there are things you will never understand about mine . I understand how I feel about you . And somehow , I know that you feel the same way about me . This is why I 'm here . After what I did ... as long as that man is alive ... no one I care about will ever be safe . ( console beeps ) It 's Wolfgang . ( Sun ) Crying won 't help him . I can feel what you 're feeling . This is what life is . Fear , rage , desire ... love . To stop feeling emotions , to stop wanting to feel them ... is to feel ... death . What do you suggest I do ? I take everything I am feeling ... everything that matters to me ... I push all of it ... into my fist ... and I fight for it .

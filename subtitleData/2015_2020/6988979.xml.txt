Except one was missing a hand , another one a leg . So they was thinking it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger . But neither one of them can drive , one being fictional , the other one extinct . And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a ' 24 Chrysler ... and , well ... this is a ' 24 Chrysler . She found you yet ? Gabriela ? See ... I 'm not looking for you , Wolvie . Well , not really . I 'm looking for someone who 's looking for you . She took something of mine when I wasn 't looking .

And they 're gone now . Logan . What did you do ? What did you do ? Answer me ! Why are we here ? No one should live like this .

You 're less affected . You know he needs a higher dose . And I know you got more money squirreled away . That money 's to get us out of here . No , not us . You and him .

If you are planning to blow your brains out ... could you wait till you 're out on the high seas ? - I just mopped these floors . - I don 't need this shit . A year ago , you asked me to help you . And God knows I 've tried . But I can 't help you , Logan , not really , if you 're not going to talk to me . I hear you at night . You 're not sleeping . You don 't wanna talk about that . Or the booze you 're drinking . Or the pus you 're wiping away from your knuckles . Or the blood I wash from your clothes . Or the fresh wounds in your chest . The ones that aren 't healing .

And live off what ? The Lord will provide . WILL : I 'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me with a new thresher . KATHRYN : All the same , I 'd love to travel someday . And I bet you will . - I could drop out of school . - Okay , let 's not go that far . I mean , I 'll do it . - KATHRYN : No . No . - NATE : Why not ? You wanna travel , I wanna travel . KATHRYN : Son . Son . WILL : That sounds good to you , right ? This is the perfect plan . Why would you want to do that , Nate ?

But you need to rest , don 't you ? LOGAN : Yeah , we 'll find a motel somewhere . The nearest one is two hours from here and it 's not even that nice .

We can leave early in the morning . Break of dawn , as it were . ( LOGAN STAMMERS ) Okay , why don 't we wash up , Pop ? Okay . Sit . KATHRYN : Um , sweetie , you want some dessert ? Two days on the road , only one meal , and hardly any sleep . She 's 11 , I 'm fucking 90 . Well , that 's 101 reasons to keep moving . I 'm not a box of avocados , Logan . LOGAN : And then what ? We stay the night , then what ? Then we take her to her friends in Eden . And then we buy the Sunseeker . Take the pills . ( WATER SPURTING ) WILL : Oh , shit ! ( PIPES CREAKING ) - What 's going on ? - Nate ! Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure . Honey , check the sink . KATHRYN : They shut it off again . They are just not going to let this thing go . Well , you might as well handle it now . It can wait till the morning . We just had rain last night . KATHRYN : We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes . All right , all right . The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here . Sometimes it gets itself shut off . - By assholes . - WILL : Hey ! No . My son is happy to go with you . No , no , no , that 's fine . The men that do this , sometimes they can be ... - I can go . - No , you got homework . All right , I 'll go . Just , uh , let me get my dad settled . ( STRAINING ) All right . WILL : I 'm just saying , I don 't care what the lawyer says . - KATHRYN : But it 's dangerous . - WILL : I 'm not gonna hurt our chances . ( LOGAN PANTING ) Want TV ? There 's TV here . I 'm fine . Okay . Get some rest . You know , Logan ... this is what life looks like . A home , people who love each other . Safe place . You should take a moment and feel it . Yeah . It 's great . Logan . Logan ! You still have time . Charles , the world is not the same as it was . We 're taking a risk hanging around here , you know that . And where we 're going , Eden ... it doesn 't exist . Her nurse got it from a comic book . You understand ? It 's not real . It is for Laura . It is for Laura . Get some rest . Canewood Beverage bought up everything out here , except for us . When we wouldn 't sell , they tried eminent domain ... then screwing with our water . Couple of months ago , somebody poisoned our dogs . LOGAN : So , out on the highway today , those trucks ... WILL : ( SIGHS ) Who knows . Maybe . Hey , look at ' em . Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains ... shucking their cloned-up super corn . You know it tastes like shit , too . Why do people eat it ? They don 't . They drink it . Corn syrup . It 's in those drinks that everyone 's having ... to stay awake , cheer up , feel strong , sexy , whatever . Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day . LOGAN : Mine still are . ( MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY THROUGH EARPHONES ) Those are for breakaway roping . Those are for barrel racing , and right here is for pole bending . They 're all second , third place . I 'm not too good at it , but my dad makes me . Do you want to listen ? ( MUSIC CONTINUES THROUGH EARPHONES ) Do you like it ? Um , here , you can take it for tonight ... and I 'll get it back from you in the morning . ( WILL GRUNTS ) ( GATE SQUEAKING ) ( WATER SPRAYING ) Looks like we 're gonna be here a while .

Uh , since the beginning . Mmm . Well , in a lot of ways , I envy you . They get to be Nate 's age , with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths ... Makes you wonder the whole point of it all . Shit . Don 't worry . We won 't need it . Stay here . Evening , Mr. Munson . What brings y 'all this way ? Why don 't you ask your boys ? Mr. Munson , you understand you 're trespassing right now , right ? I have an easement with the previous owner of your property . Huh . Bullshit . " Previous " being the operative word .

Something unspeakable . I 've remembered what happened in Westchester . This is not the first time I 've hurt people . Until today , I didn 't know . You wouldn 't tell me .

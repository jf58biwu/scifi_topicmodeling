 - When I was a kid . My mother and I loved to sit and watch like that in the night sky . To dream that we are not alone . What stars are the eyes of the angels . Who looked after us . But when my mother was ill , none of them helped . Then I realized that no one was there . Silence . Emptiness . And cold . All right , let 's go . ( Dog barks ) Quiet . Charl , what are you looking at ? No there is nothing . Let 's go to ! Subtitles : Bonnie

 " You are not alone . Conflict is coming . " That is the message we received . Conflict ? Is that a threat ? No , sir . It 's more like a warning . This message was sent to us by a friendly alien race known as Antarians . They wanna help us . Do we need help ? The Antarians aren 't the only ones to have found us . Enemies are already on their way . Luckily , it 's a great distance , and it will take many years before they can reach us . The Antarians have offered us a gift , this unique suit of power that one person will wear as our champion . It will take many decades to transport that suit to us so we have selected a child gifted with both incredible intelligence and athletic prowess . He will spend his entire life training . We will push him to achieve perfection , and then improved perfection . And after perfection is achieved , we 'll double the score . As he grows more mature , we 'll test him in every way imaginable . We will prepare him for anything the universe can throw at him . Yah ! Aahhh ! One final question , what if this champion fails ? Sir , are you familiar with the Greek hero Perseus ? When Perseus was sent forth to defeat the Gorgon , he was armed with four gifts from the heavens : The helm of Hades ... the winged boots of Hermes ... the shield of Athena ... and the sword of Zeus . And with the power of these gifts combined , Perseus was victorious . Sir , our Perseus , our Champion of Earth , will not fail ... because he will not know how to . Perfect score , sir . Good . Training 's over . Soon , the entire universe will know the full potential of the human race . LAZER TEAM Subrip : Pix Country music Hey there , Gloria . Going kind of fast . Don 't make me run you in . God , I hate Friday nights . What a night here at Milford Stadium , where the Mustangs are up by 21 points with two minutes left on the clock . Ladies and gentlemen , with us tonight , former Milford MVP , Herman Mendoza . The Texas Tornado ! Stand up , Herman . If he can stand . I know that guy . Remember , no open containers there , Herman . He doesn 't need to be messing with the fire water , I can tell you that . Herman Mendoza has been known to puke a little bit . Where 's Mindy ? Mindy ! The cheerleaders are leading cheers , everything seems to be spelled correctly , the hot dog vendors are vending hot dogs , and I 'll tell you one thing , the commentators are commentating . Wouldn 't you agree , Wink ? Yup . It feels right ! Water ? Wrong team , asshole ! Awesome . Move it ! Of course , Milford 's high score is due to their star quarterback and sixth-year senior , Zach Spencer . He 's got a cannon for an arm , but he 's struggled with accuracy . Just a bit off the mark . Well , he 's been known to gamble on big plays , as indicated by his signature " roll the dice " gesture . I don 't think that 's what that gesture 's meant to convey . With one minute on the clock , Spencer fakes a hand-off , goes out on his own ! There 's the block ! That 's gotta hurt . Free and clear now . Touchdown Mustangs ! That 's gonna be the game . An amazing play by Zach Spencer , as he does his post-game stretching . Always important to keep those hips limber , Wink . - You 've no idea what you 're talking about , do you ? - I do not , Wink , not at all . I 've heard people say That we 'll all find our place someday Hey ! You 're going the wrong way ! Sorry , Sheriff . He ain 't a Sheriff , Woody . He 's a half-ass . Bye , Sheriff Half-ass ! Yeah , it 's nice to see you too , Herman . Goddamnit ! That 's funny , guys . Yeah ! All right , I need to see some ID 's now ! Or what , you 're gonna hit us with one of those light sabers ? Hey , we 're not the George you 're looking for . Shut up , Franksen . All right , that 's it . Everybody out of the vehicle . Peace out , Boba Fett . - Damnit ! - Live long and prosper , baby ! It 's not even the right movie , Moron ! Base , this is Deputy Hagan in pursuit of a 4-81 . I need back-up assistance at ... No dice , Deputy Hagan . Sheriff wants you out at Ruby Lake for an extraction . For an extraction ? Base , what exactly am I extracting ? All right . You jerkoffs couldn 't beat me on the field , so you think you could beat me here ? I get it . Hey , douchebag , this is our party , all right ? Dude , I won the game . It 's my party . - That 's not how parties work , asshole . - They 're all my party ! That doesn 't even make sense ... Great . Drunk teenagers . This will be fun . Hey , guys , stripper 's here ! All right . Do you want Turner Bull ? Okay , let 's do it . Ready ? - Wait , take it again . - I think I blinked . Bye , Jules . My God ! Dad , what are you doing at this party ? I 'm working , Mindy . What are you doing at this party ? - Partying ! - There are two people in the world ... That should not see you with that beer in your hand , your father and a cop . And I 'm both of them . Please tell me that is not Zach Spencer out there . Yeah , it 's him . Go easy on him , Dad . He 's kind of dumb . All right , fine . Thanks . Hey ! Yo , kick his ass , kick his ass , kick his ass . Knock-Knock ! Dude , you need to get the hell out of here now ! Dude , you need to get the hell out of here ! How about that ? All right , lovebirds , break it up . - That 's what I thought . Number one ! - Come on , kid , let 's go . I 'm talking to you , kid ! Top of the world ! All right , that 's it . Undefeated , bitch ! Yeah ! One foot in front of the other . I got it ! I know the feet ! Hey , see if Mindy needs a ride , too ! Kid , you have the right to remain silent . - You should do that . - Bah ! It 's not funny . Stop . All right , I know we 've all had a lot of fun tonight , but the show 's over . It 's time for you all to go home . There 's nothing else to see here . You 're lucky I 'm not taking you in , kid . You should be arrested . Your face should be arrested ! 'Cause your face is a whore ! You should really buckle up back there . I 'd hate to have to give you a ticket for it . Wait , I know you . You 're that guy that blew the Championship game like 800 years ago ! What does everyone call you ? Has-been half-back ? No , it 's Half-ass Hagan ! Seriously , dude , that hurts ! Wait , Hagan ! Mindy 's name ... That 's right . Mindy is my daughter . That 's why you 're trippin ' on me . Look , dude , I get it . You don 't like the idea of someone dating your daughter . You know , kid , I raised my daughter to be a strong , independent woman who 's capable of making her own decisions . That being said , as her father , sometimes I disagree with those decisions . Look , don 't worry about it . Mindy and I are just friends . I mean , I haven 't even banged her yet . God ! I should really get the breaks checked in this car . We 're tracking an inbound UFO . Just entered the atmosphere . Excellent . Men , this is a moment in time that has been decades in the making . Tonight , our aliens friends will bestow upon us a gift that will give humanity its rightful place in the galaxy . Tonight , we get our champion ... Tonight , we will get our champion ... Tonight , the Earth will get it 's champ ... Who in the hell authorized fireworks ? What the ... There 's a burn ban out here for a reason . Hold on , kid . Gotta make a pit stop . Woo ! Awesome . ... looks like it 's time for another beer run , Woody . This is only my second . How many did you drink , Herman ? Whatever 24 minus 2 is , man ! You do the math ! You ain 't never gonna figure it out , dumbass . Light another one . Yeah , all right . Here we go . Come on now . Ho-ho-ho ! Darn tree ! Woo ! Yeah ! Shit ! Direct hit ! Nice one , Woody ! That was nothing . Hey ! Well , well , look who it is . Woody , prep another one . Stay where you are , Woody . No , Woody , prep another one . Look , here , Officer , this here is private property . Yeah , you only get to say that when it 's " your " private property , Herman . Besides , you 're breaking the law ! Since when is blowing shit up against the law ? Since they invented laws ! Yeah ? What do they say about this ? Add littering to my list of offenses . Look , you either give me the fireworks or you can spend the night in a drunk tank ! That goes for you too , Woody . I done that before . Someone threw a ball and I fell in a tub of water . No , that 's a dunk tank , Woody . Drunk tank is jail . I don 't wanna do that . You want the fireworks ? Fine . I 'll give you a firework . The Mama Gigante . The courier vessel is arriving , sir . All right , this is it , everyone ! High-pressure moment . What you gonna do , Hagan ? Herman ? Oooh ... Herman . This gonna be a big one . Do not light that firework .

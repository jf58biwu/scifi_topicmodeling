 New software . but anonymous . another puzzle piece . Niki ? We 're getting closer . Never forget . This is how you treat someone who saved your skin ? We have no intention of trusting you with the location of our safe house . Is all this really necessary ? Hmm . Chef 's kitchen . Is anyone hungry ? no ? Kira ? they will be safely somewhere else . We 've got one bit of business only . You said you could help me get this bot out of my face . not me personally . But chin up . Susan Duncan 's alive . surely she 'll have the answer to your situation . And what is it you want ? What he wants is to rescue Rachel . What can I say ? She pierced this armoured heart . Shall we breakfast ? I assume you can 't trace it . but you have a source who could . Do we ? Someone tipped you the Neos were in Iceland . or able to get deep . Am I right ? Share your source ... and we 'll both have what we need . that 's Alison for ya . - Ready ? - Mmm-hmm . God . that 's the head of Dyad . - He never gave me a raise . Not once . bitch ? look at that . - Yeah . but the surrounding tissue 's necrotic . It was feeding off him . Buried down there in the cold dirt under the Hendrix garage . God . but this is a goldmine . it 's right there . run a cell assay . - Okay . - Then we open it up . la frittata . Go-to brunch for lazy lovers . too . And only a fluffy frittata will she abide . And here was I thinking psychopaths incapable of genuine human connection . you know . that figures . its origins masked by redirection through a series of proxy servers . And why do you think my contact can help with that ? Let me convince them . Felix is here . Fee ? Why ? love . but you don 't get access . will you take Ferdinand and his frittata into the back room ? He can eat alone . Benjamin ? I don 't think it 's as bad as you think . It is . It 's terrible . My name is mud at Glendale Community . not true . You don 't need them . We 've always talked about doing our own musical revue . I would love to . ♪ Jesus Christ ♪ ♪ Superstar ♪ ♪ Do you think you 're ♪ - ♪ What they say you are- - ♪ - Shh ! ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ - ♪ Don 't get me wrong ♪ - - ♪ Don 't you get me wrong now ♪ I have to go . ten minutes . - No . - Bye . - ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ see you soon . - Bye . - Bye . ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ What the hell is wrong with you ? You don 't recognise me ? Beth . I specifically told you to drop it . And you went back to Club Neolution . You went to Lifespring Fertility . I didn 't ... I didn 't know . I told you I was a carrier in confidence . Why couldn 't you just let it go ? Wait ! do you ... do you wanna grab a coffee ? Cops . You think you can just fix everything with a cup of coffee ? - -Stay away from me ! I don 't know why you didn 't tell me . you were very busy with your bio-sister . If you had told me that you had some kind of a Neolutionist implant in your face- - now the air has been cleared . Sarah needs us right now . and ... you have to keep her clear of all of this . of course . Fine . I hope you find what you 're looking for . - and when she- - you 're on speaker with S and Felix . I don 't want to talk about Dr Leekie . I bet you don 't . I have something else . Who 's that ? She just accosted me at Aroma Café . She thought I was Beth . Isn 't that the same girl that we were looking for at Club Neo ? She was upset . She said that Beth apparently investigated some IVF clinic she went to . Lifespring Fertility ? and what 's that got to do with the bot implants ? so maybe she has one of those things in her . could you find out some more ? Maybe start with the clinic ? I have budgets to review . I 'm really more of an idea person . Alison ! please ! Go to the clinic . it 's fine . I 'll help . I 'll help you . I 'll ... I 'll go with you . Thank you . Felix . Hey . would you look at that . It 's a collage of babies . very cuddling . see ? um ... I am making mess again . it 's ... it 's not that . It 's Alison . I 'm not in the crafts room . I know . I know . Um ... but ... before we adopted Oscar and Gemma ... Alison and I tried to have our own kids . This was difficult for you . very . It was ... the most difficult time of my life . But it was ... it was harder for Alison . She is jealous and angry and bringing the police ? maybe a little bit . We just need to ... tiptoe . Try not to set her off . You 'll get used to it . - -Sorry . Good talk . sorry . You want me to meet you where ? - Hey . - Hey . Did MK get back to you ? yeah . isn 't it ? Unless it 's a booty call . She 's inside . - She 's here ? - She said just you . Don 't steal anything . Hello ? MK ? Sarah . You have three minutes . I need to know what these implants do . You knew Beth was investigating them . she didn 't tell me . I need help to get them out . yeah ? of course . She was one of our creators . 1991 . Lab fire . Except she 's still alive . She 'll know how to get this implant out . This is a message from Rachel . Susan 's got her captive . Rachel ? find out where they are . Rachel contacted you ? No . Someone we trust . all right ? I 'm so sick of pissing around . I need this thing out of my face . I 'm going straight to the top . Show me the specifics . Put it in the ... the USB port . I want to meet in person . I 'll put you in danger . MK . and meet you in an hour ... at Beth 's . Fitting . Okay . and this is everything I 've learned about the place . floor plans . hon . colour-coordinated . let me sort this . We 're going to pose as prospective parents to determine if this is a Neolutionist front ? I 've already booked your appointment and these are your IDs . - Julian Gray ? - Yeah . Yeah . this is good . - Did you use the new laminator ? - Mmm-hmm . And these are real people with real medical records okay ? you get out . where 's yours ? Beth 's already been in there . I can 't go in . who 's the couple ? Donnie . Oh . I said . Douglas and Julian for Dr Laing . - Hi . of course . - Right here . - Thank you . It 's a terrible picture . - Just a moment . - Thank you . Donnie . Stop chewing the scenery . What the bloody hell are you doing ? darling . you 're mincing . I don 't know what that means . do you have any gay friends ? you do . Science commonly holds the belief that 5 % to 10 % of your male friends are gay . Not in Bailey Downs . Especially in Bailey Downs . so don 't act gay . Okay . I 'm just gonna get you started on some paperwork and a sperm sample . who 's going to be the father ? I am . I guess we 'll just test you both . - Okay . Great . - Sure . - That 's a lot of sperm . Okay . Oh . Ah . Thank you . Bad Puppy . My favourite . - Here is your sample cup . - Right . sperm . Jill . Portia . - Make sure you take your vitamins . - Portia Grossman 's pregnant ? no . The Grossmans gave up on IVF years ago . We discussed adoption with them . easy . You let me deal with Portia . Is there anything else you need ? and I need to ... you know . Masturbate ? I think I could use a little ... Air Italia to help me along . I 'm in a public place . um ... Mrs Hendrix . you have to put on your seat belt . hold on . Uh ... um ... I 'm having trouble doing up the buckle . Take a look ? molto duro . Very duro . come with me to the lavatory . Please take me to the lavatory . Is that your leaning tower ? It 's not leaning any more . baby . - So spicy ! Ooh ! it is so tight ... in this aeroplane lavatory . - I 'm arriving ! - Si ! I 'm landing ! no . Unreal . Okay ... No scolex . No cerebral ganglion . It 's got a synthetic core . I 'm not even sure we could say it 's alive . God . The question is what does it do ? And why did Leekie have one ? She started showing symptoms three weeks ago . thank you . And is she the youngest subject to develop symptoms ? She is . does she ? - No . And has Susan considered immunosuppressive therapy for her ? That treatment induced rapid onset in Jennifer Fitzsimmons . It was torture . but Charlotte is prepubescent . and her autoimmune response might be easier to ... to control . I 'll bring it up with Susan . Niki ... Susan Duncan . like me . Where are you hiding ? ping . Rachel 's hidden deep . Who is she reaching out to ? You ? So you are Ferdinand . Who is this mysterious source of Sarah 's ? Insider ? Outsider ? I 've been racking my brains . - Biscuit ? Siobhan . I 'd like a family of my own someday . I 've squirreled a little away . Enough to recover by the seaside in style . Just Rachel and I. Bide our time ... steady climb back to power . Interesting definition of family . don 't they ? MK ? I 'm here . MK ? You said you 'd meet me in person . - He 's Topside . - What ? their cleaning . I made a decision . Sometimes you have to work with people you don 't like . we don 't . I will do anything . I 'll deal with anyone to get this implant out of my face . - Did you find Susan Duncan ? - We 're finished . - I can 't trust you now . sorry . Alison ? Portia ! what 's wrong ? Oh . sweetie . - Can we talk ? So we wanted to try one more time ... No go . I 'm so sorry . but did you try something special ? new technology or ... No ? I 'd do anything . I would ... - I 'd pay anything . - Ali ... Oscar and Gemma are such amazing kids . I really do . I just ... and ... I just want to have my own baby . Ali ... You know what ? Maybe you should go back in there . See Dr Bosch . Ask for the Brightborn treatments . - Okay ? - Okay . Thank you . And are you married ? though some of us don 't always wear our wedding rings . It 's because some of us don 't need our rings to feel secure in our relationship . we should have the test results in a few days . do you have an egg donor in mind ? - Not yet . - Yes . - We are still narrowing it down . - Yeah . that we are ... thrilled to be working with you . And we 're both very open to any kind of emerging technologies . you two are healthy young men . I doubt you 'll have any problems conceiving . we were told to ask for you specifically . Oh ? And to ask about the Brightborn treatments . How 'd you hear about Brightborn ? From a very satisfied customer . could you bring in some Brightborn packages ? - Hey . - Hey . MK didn 't show . I 'm sure she had good cause . Dizzy . I need you to help me find her . You keep banging on my door asking for favours . You ever think about what I might want ? what ? I need to know exactly what 's going on between you and this twin of yours . I do . - Why ? - I have my reasons . too . fine . Clones . We 're clones . Jesus . Genetic identicals . How many others are there out there in this little experiment ? Twenty-two that we know of ... - including MK . Nine of us still living . - Do you believe me ? - I don 't know . it makes for a great story . I 've met with MK three times in person and each time she had different plates on her car . - What 's that about ? - Exactly . but they 're all defunct . What 's that tell you ? She 's got access to scrapped cars ? She once told me she worked as a night watchman . Three scrap yards in the city . That one 's closest to Beth 's . Who 's Beth ? Save that for later . you 're gonna want me to come with ya . Why would I want that ? I think she could be dangerous . Little science babies ... forgive me . I did not know to feed you liquid nitrogens . But ... your twins are in my belly . I will tell them all about you and our adventures . family Hendrick . There . That 's gotta be it . this thing ? I 'm sure she already knows we 're here . Mika ? Mika ! screw this . whoa . What ... A little messier than my usual approach . wait . What ? What ? Look at this . See the mat ? It 's a pressure plate bomb . the whole place goes up . Jesus . Kinda makes you wonder what she 's hiding . Herself . Be careful ! We need to find whatever she knows about a doctor called Susan Duncan . She can remove the bot . Password . Yeah . I 'll need a few minutes . MK . The pigment is coming along . the tech will be invisible . Charlotte ? Why do you keep asking that ? Another message . Charlotte ? Maybe someday I 'll be allowed to visit you there . Yours is nicer . I am willing to consider immunosuppressive therapy for her . are you ? There is one other option for Charlotte . Do you know what it is ? She 's the youngest subject to fall ill . her dataset could be of value to the rest of us . Including Ira . And what would you do ? or intervene ? Is this a test ? It 's a decision . One of many we 'd have to make every day . MK . I 'm in . You said she was tracking someone named Susan Duncan ? MK was tracking you . What ? locations . MK ? but motivating people to share information quickly is my speciality . thank you . If she 'd have brought me with her - I 'd be out of your hair by now . Sarah . she 's found something . Scottie . I think you 're gonna want to see this . hella baked or what ? Just check this out . shit . Bioluminescence ? Green fluorescent proteins . They must be using them as markers to track gene expression . So the bot 's introducing foreign DNA ? it 's all congregating in the tumour . I bet that 's why Leekie had one . It 's some kind of gene therapy delivery system . It could be changing Sarah 's DNA . Sarah ? Sarah ? Over here . Behind you . Well ... hello there . - And you are ... - A friend of Sarah 's . How apropos . Sarah 's Deep Throat is a sheep . I have information about Susan Duncan and Rachel . That is excellent news . shall we ? I would not stand up if I were you . it 's not necessary . it is . Ferdinand . What 's your name ? Hmm ? but I don 't . - I know you . - Is that right ? - Yes . Ferdinand Chevalier . Bastard son of the 10th Earl of Sussex . A stigma you still can 't get over . but ... top marks for presentation . You discovered your bloodlust in the British SAS . Learned to kill quickly and quietly . Perfect recruit for a Topside cleaner . she scrubbed it already . Sarah . Neolution . Or ... Rachel Duncan . ma 'am . Helsinki . Is that where MK 's from ? Does this ring a bell ? isn 't it ? maybe ? I always suspected one clone escaped the purge . Veera Suominen . Veera Suominen . Let me guess . Her name isn 't MK . And neither one of those girls is you . or ... were put together on purpose . Niki . Niki . She was my only friend . This was a week before she was killed . Just met her boyfriend Alecks . Just began her life . You gassed her family . You burned her alive . Jesus ... I know what she 's doing . S ... I need to talk to Ferdinand . isn 't he ? At Beth 's . - What ? God . That text wasn 't from you . - -I need your car . no . please . - You 're serious ? I must be out of my mind . Sarah ? Cosima . but I think we figured out what the bots do . Let me guess . It 's bad news . I understand . This is your revenge fantasy . You 've been playing it in your head for years . You killed six of my sisters . Murdered 32 of our friends and loved ones . What 's stopping me from standing up and killing one more ? You tell me . Cowardice ? Narcissism ? Rachel ? - -Rachel ? She was hidden deep . You found her ? I found you first . Sarah handed you to me . I always dreamed of putting a name to your face . Hurting you like you hurt me . Veera ? Veera ! - That 's not my name any more . - Stop it ! Stop ! - Shit . - Sarah ! please . Mika ? I think you know . There 's a bomb under my chair . You can 't do this . I need him . He needs to pay for what he did to Niki . all right ? I know about Helsinki . Did Beth ? Did you tell her what happened to you ? she was too fragile . I 'm not ... all right ? I 'm not gonna back down . but we 're not gonna do it like this . it is this . look . look . The guy is garbage . I know . I know . But he saved my life . it 's true . That 's a good point . Mika ... we know what they do . It 's some kind of gene editing . It could be changing my DNA . all right ? And Ferdinand is an asset . - Do you understand that ? - Listen to her . it 's true . I can help you . I 've got money . Yes . - 3.7 million . - What ? I sifted through your shell companies . Traced your wire transfers . Password . Corn cob . Two words . Enter it . I will find you . I will finish Helsinki . you 're just gonna leave now ? too . You used me . and now you 're just gonna blow it all up ? Sarah . No . Your friend Niki died . Beth died . What about our sisters that are still alive ? I 'm sorry . plastic explosives . Taped together pretty well . And you 're absolutely certain there is only one circuit ? Far as I can see . we 're even now . You understand ? and I saved you . I 'm gonna cut this wire and leave the building . are you gonna stand up . Am I clear ? Just give me a moment . the whole thing could just- - let me prepare myself ! all right . I 'm sure this whole thing is gonna be fine . I 'm going to be a little short of funds . You 're a clever chap . I 'm sure you 'll find some way to make yourself useful . Come in . No one 's ever knocked before . My opinion on Charlotte 's treatment couldn 't wait till morning ? Well ? Immunosuppressive therapy likely won 't save her . her data has value . More value than her life . We shouldn 't intervene . isn 't it ? I need to go away again . Why ? Have you found Sarah ? Kendall ? We know you contacted Ferdinand . we won 't treat Charlotte . You 're right to think of the future . This stuff from Dr Bosch better be worth it . Let 's see what creepy Brightborn is all about . Are you having difficulty conceiving ? seeking to have a child on your terms ? Perhaps you have genetic risk factors . - Totally seen that woman before . - Whatever the reason ... I think she was on Oprah . we can help . CEO and founder of the Brightborn Group . a smooth pregnancy and a healthy and thriving newborn . But why stop there ? - -Mainstream reproductive technology . It 's like a whole new side to Neolution . ... all of our children are born stronger and healthier . one baby at a time .

 ( stahma ) previously on defiance ... This is our best chance to take rahm by surprise . I don 't want him in there . It 's not your choice . I 'm going . [ somber music ] - Just be careful . - Always . [ all grunting ] No ! [ explosion booms ] No ! ( irisa ) you gambled . If it had worked , you 'd be a hero . ( nolan ) yeah , but it didn 't . They trusted me , they followed me , And now they 're dead because of me . Rahm tak is setting up camp right outside the stasis nets . I 've got an idea . It 's a suicide mission . I 'm offering you a chance at redemption . - Posthumously . - Ah ... There 's the catch . [ warbling tone ] What are you still doing here ? Go . My body is yours . [ dramatic music ] Agh ! [ all yelling ] [ explosion booms ] [ rumbling ] ¶ ¶ [ foreboding music ] [ low growling ] [ panting ] ¶ ¶ [ gasps ] ¶ ¶ [ banging ] ¶ ¶ [ heavy breathing ] [ growling ] [ ominous music ] [ growling ] ¶ ¶ [ growling ] ¶ ¶ [ impact ] [ screaming ] [ growling ] [ tearing ] [ cries ] [ roaring ] [ screams ] [ tearing ] ( amanda ) the town of defiance has been attacked By something monstrous . Hate . Hate drove the votanis collective To collapse that tunnel , Brutally murdering 27 brave heroes . Their faces are up here , memorialized on this wall . It 's a testament to our spirit that hate took us by surprise . And for our ignorance , We paid a very high price ... In blood . The blood of husbands and wives , Sons ... And daughters . We owe them a debt we can never repay . Rahm tak and his militia are dead Thanks to the sacrifice made by datak tarr And the 27 brave soldiers Who died bringing the fight to rahm 's doorstep . I promise you These lights were not extinguished in vain . [ somber music ] ¶ ¶ The lawkeeper would like to say a few words . No ! I will not listen to the man who killed my son . - You butcher ! [ crowd gasps and murmurs ] ¶ ¶ [ door slams ] ¶ ¶ Things go wrong in war . [ exhales ] I made a mistake . People died . I 'm sorry . ¶ ¶ I wish i could change that . But i can 't . I--i--i don 't have anything else to say . It 's okay . [ sighs ] ¶ ¶ Alak . My condolences . Keep ' em . My mother ... You know where she is , don 't you ? I do not . But wherever she is , one may assume her heart grieves . [ murmurs ] Well , she 's a coward and a murderer . You do not understand the position she was in . You 're right . I don 't . If you do happen to see my mother , you could tell her That the mayor may have pardoned her , but i haven 't . She comes anywhere near me or my son , i 'll kill her . [ speaking native language ] I brought you some food from the market . I 'm afraid i don 't have much of an appetite . [ bottles clink ] Hmm . Were you able to make contact with alak ? He did not have kind words for you . As expected . Was he well ? Well enough to attend the funeral of your husband . There was a funeral ? Did alak organize it ? No , the mayor . I took the liberty of attending Assuming that you 'd be anxious for details . Why would amanda rosewater honor my husband ? He was hung as a traitor . Yet he was honored alongside those Who fell fighting rahm tak . Datak walked that bomb into the votanis camp . He martyred himself to save the town . Dying in the service of others is not the end I would have expected for my husband . It is possible he did it for you . [ somber music ] How so ? Datak secured a pardon As a condition of his sacrifice . [ sobbing ] You are free to return home . Hmm . ¶ ¶ [ door rattles and creaks ] [ footsteps tapping ] You okay ? That was indur who walked out , zero 's father . And that 's what 's left of zero 's rifle ? What are you gonna do ? Figure his old man should have it . I 'll bring it to him . No , this one 's on me . You can 't think that 's a good idea . - I don 't . - Then why are you going ? 'cause if this was yours , If that had been you burned to ash Down in that tunnel and not ender 's boy- - It 's what needs to be done . [ door rattles and creaks ] [ door thuds ] [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ Indur ? Thought you should have this . My son used to make stew every tuesday . Do you know what day today is ? I don 't want a broken rifle . I want my son . I want him sitting across from me at that table Complaining about how his stew is never spicy enough . Can you give me that ? No , sir , i cannot . [ gun clicks ] [ breathing heavily ] [ somber music ] So how 's this gonna end ? ¶ ¶ [ grunts and gasps ] ¶ ¶ Hey , this way . Where 's nolan ? - Busy . - Is he okay ? He 'll be fine . What have you got ? Sanitation found the body this morning . [ echoing screams ] Indogene victim . [ foreboding music ] The stasis nets are down . Maybe a sabre wolf wandered in through bissel pass . A sabre wolf wouldn 't break from the pack . This was something else . [ amanda grunts ] Doc ? Doc ! We got a body here . Ugh . Doc ! That 's weird . She 's usually open by now . ( doc ) been memorizing my office hours ? Obviously you know me better than i know myself . Who 's the stiff ? ( ender ) did my son ever tell you about lucy ? Lucy ? I 'm afraid i didn 't have the privilege . I built it for him . He named it after a human girl who lived down the way . He was fond of her , but she was young and fickle And broke his heart . Zero used to say that this weapon Was the second most beautiful thing he 'd ever seen . So he named it after the first . Ender , we all lose people we care about . What 's important in all of this Is that you don 't lose yourself , Not to the anger , not to the ache in your gut , Not to the anything . I have nothing left to lose . And that 's all because of you . [ somber music ] You 're right . I 'm just a grunt . I 'm not a general . I led ' em all down into that hole , And i got ' em all killed , Your son included . And i 'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life , Live with the memories of your boy . Is that the same speech you 're giving to all of the grieving ? No , you 're the only one i 've come to see . And why is that ? What makes my son so special to you ? ¶ ¶ I don 't know . ¶ ¶ Well ... Should i feel honored ? When it comes to your boy , Without a doubt . When it comes to me ... How you feel about me , you , sir , are entitled To feel whatever way you want . [ hailer beeps ] I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I 'm tired of talking anyway . [ beeping continues ] Answer it . It might be important . [ beeping continues ] Yeah , kiddo , i 'll be there as soon as i can . Go . I appreciate you making the effort . ¶ ¶ ( doc ) keep your hands off my dead body . You said i could apprentice , so let me apprentice . I was joking . Did you not pick up on my withering sarcasm ? Oh , we 'll have to work out a signal for that . [ device clicks ] Think you knew him ? Or her ? Oh , i see . The stiff 's an indogene , So of course we all know each other . Little bit of old-earth racism there , hey , doc ? When you were a vet , did you refuse To treat black cats as well ? You done ? For the moment . You seem to be pretty disturbed by this particular corpse . You don 't come across as someone that gets disturbed very easily . What are you , a pet psychiatrist too ? No , but i 'm thinking of opening a practice . Hmm . [ electronic beeping ] There 's something about the way the skin feels . I don 't like it . [ beeping ] Doc , that 's you . [ foreboding music ] How can the victim be you ? [ beeping ] ¶ ¶ I have no idea . [ door rattles and creaks ] Ready to go hunting ? There was an animal attack last night . You identify the animal ? Not yet . What about the victim ? Doc and samir are working on it . [ exotic instrumental music playing ] Given what i know about your people , What you have neglected to tell anyone else on this planet , How do you know i won 't betray you ? You always do what is in your best interest , And betraying me would not serve you well . There is that . I suppose it is your daughter , really , who should concern you . And why is that ? I believe she will betray you . Kindzi is under control . Where has she been these last few days ? Do you know ? I trust her . What will she do when you wake your people ? What will she tell them ? My family will follow me towards peace . But your daughter offers a different path . Your family will be forced to choose . Kindzi will obey me . Of course . You know her best . An auspicious homecoming . Favi ? Oh , you 're alive ! Oh , i was so worried . [ gasps ] I 'm cleaning up this mess . Thank you , andina . It 's good to be home . [ somber music ] ¶ ¶ [ foreboding music ] ¶ ¶ Lawkeeper . Kind of busy right now , t 'evgin . I assure you my business is as urgent as yours . Have you seen my daughter ? No . Is she missing ? She has an independent spirit . As a father , i find it ... Vexing . I can relate . Why don 't you get upstairs , And see if you can find any tracks up top ? - On it . - Tracks ? What manner of animal would require that much firepower ? ¶ ¶ [ echoing growls ] ( nolan ) wish i knew . You all right ? The scene is grizzly . Yeah , that it is . You know , if you have any insight at all Into what kind of creature might have done all this damage , Now would be a really good time to tell me . ( irisa ) nolan ! [ foreboding music ] More blood up here . No tracks , but it looks like it kept eating As it headed east . Be right up there . ¶ ¶ You know , defiance has had more than it 's- - - Tarr wife came back . - I heard . What 's the world coming to ? Terrorist gets to live in a big house , While we 're out here eating rat meat . That 's the goddamn kwonyo gyendo for you , huh ? Too true . [ loud growl ] What was that ? [ snarling ] [ growling ] ( nolan ) hear that ? [ suspenseful music ] [ faint growl and screaming ] Come on . [ indistinct chatter ] ( man ) hear that ? [ growling ] [ screaming ] [ growling ] [ tearing and screaming ] [ grunts ] ¶ ¶ God damn it ! You can 't blame yourself . [ scratching ] [ gunfire ] It 's a raccoon . Yeah , i see that . Take a couple of hours , get your head on straight . I 'll chirp you if i find anything . You saying i can 't do the job ? Maybe we should ask him ? Happy hunting . [ somber music ] ¶ ¶ [ footsteps tapping ] Oh . Have you seen much of alak ? I bring him food and clean laundry twice a week . I do what i can to make him happy . How are his injuries ? Healing well . I wish he was home , though . The mccawley house frightens me . - Afraid of ghosts ? - No , afraid of death . I think that 's a very reasonable fear , don 't you ? I suppose so . Poor alak . So kind . So sad . Don 't get me wrong . It 's beautiful the way He loved christie . But the dead are dead . We must mourn them and move on . Moving on is rarely easy . [ somber music ] Perhaps the next time you visit alak , I will accompany you . Whatever you wish , favi stahma . What is it , andina ? Out with it . Alak kept his gun from the militia . There are two bullets left inside , Both meant for you- - One from rafe , one from christie . He keeps it by the front door . I would not recommend knocking . ¶ ¶ Thank you , for telling me . He 's been through a lot . Yes . We all have . ¶ ¶ You still have me , favi . ¶ ¶ That i do , andina . That i do . ( samir ) so who would clone you ? Smart money 's on the galaxy 's favorite puckered rectums , The omec . Why ? Well , aside from me being the perfect gift For birthdays , anniversaries , and bar mitzvahs , The possibilities are endless and depressing . You know what 'd be weird ? Is if that 's you on the table , and you 're the clone . Or you 're both clones . Or- - - I 'm gonna stop talking now . - That might be best . [ hissing ] Uh , why does your clone 's lungs have glitter in them ? They 're spores . Bagra spores . They only grow in old st . Louis . [ tense music ] The omec are hiding something from us . Where are you going ? ¶ ¶ I intend to shut those sons of bitches down . By yourself ? You know we should call nolan and amanda . Nolan and amanda , right . The last time i asked those two to choose Between the omec and me , They tore a strip off my hide And used it for spare parts . Those two will pussyfoot around and give the purples A chance to destroy evidence . No , i 'm getting proof first . - Let me go with you . - No . Why not ? I can handle myself . If i 'm not back by this time tomorrow , I 'm counting on you to sound the alarm . [ door rattles and thuds ] [ light rock music ] ¶ ¶ [ breathing heavily ] ¶ ¶ ( man ) ¶ don 't you know it 's revolution ? ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ i 'm right where i want to be ¶ ( nolan voice-over ) [ echoing ] got to practice this day and night Till we can do it blindfolded . ( man ) ¶ i don 't care for no solution ¶ ( nolan voice-over ) [ echoing ] that 's it . Come on . Pick those legs up . ( man ) ¶ i see what i want to see ¶ ( nolan voice-over ) i 'm trying to get these people ready to fight a battle . ¶ ¶ ( man ) ¶ yes , i know it 's such a shock ¶ ¶ it has to be ¶ ( nolan voice-over ) it 's our responsibility . ( man ) ¶ it has to be ¶ ( nolan voice-over ) there is some real talent here . ( man ) ¶ and i can ¶ [ gunshot ] ( man ) ¶ feel that silver lining ¶ ( nolan voice-over ) come on . We have to get strong . ¶ ¶ ( man ) ¶ and know the whole thing falls apart ¶ ( nolan voice-over ) we will face the beast , and we will defeat him . ( man ) ¶ and i can see ¶ [ gunshot ] ( nolan ) this confederacy of the strong Will hold the line with pride . We will face rahm tak , and we will defeat him . Do we have an understanding ? - Defiance ! - Defiance ! ( all ) defiance ! ( man ) ¶ to just ¶ ¶ turn to dust ¶ [ grunts ] - [ yells ] - ¶ turns to dust ¶ ¶ ¶ ( man ) ¶ don 't you know it 's revolution ? ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ i 'm right where i want to be ¶ How 'd you get in here ? The door was open . Where 's your daughter ? Don 't know . Don 't care . That doesn 't sound right . What troubles you ? Too many dead people . [ sniffs and grunts ] You 're hurting . I can take that pain away . I don 't want it to go away . You should leave . I like it here . Wouldn 't you rather feel good , Even if only for a moment ? No . You 're not the " feel good for a moment " Type of guy , are you ? I think you like to take it slow , Savor the moment . [ inhales and exhales deeply ] [ relaxed electronic music ] ¶ ¶ No . [ growling ] - [ growls ] no . [ foreboding music ] ¶ ¶ That growl , the beast , what do you know about that ? What aren 't you telling me ? ¶ ¶ [ growling ] [ groans ] [ groans ] [ hailer beeping ] [ door rattles ] [ beeping continues ] [ sighs ] Shouldn 't you answer that ? Doesn 't matter right now . What the hell 's going on ? [ chuckles ] Spoken like somebody who knows exactly what 's going on . - You 're drunk . - You ought to know . Well , at least i can drink and hold myself together . Clearly you can 't . [ grunts ] Now get out of my way . I to go see t 'evgin . No . Why ? Why ? Why ? 'cause him and kindzi know something about these attacks , Something they 're not telling us . All right , you 're going to go see t 'evgin like this ? Hmm ? Come on . Sit down . Okay . Shh . Shh . Hey . Hey , in the morning , i will go with you to the mines , And we 'll get to the bottom of this . How many more people have got to die ? I need you to sleep this off . All right ? For me . Please . [ gentle music ] ¶ ¶ [ foreboding music ] ¶ ¶ [ hissing ] [ hissing and sputtering ] [ hissing ] ¶ ¶ Great . What could possibly go wrong here ? ¶ ¶ [ door creaking ] ¶ ¶ [ gasps ] [ speaking native language ] [ ominous music ] ¶ ¶ We created life . Doesn 't that make us gods ? Well , you won 't be getting a hosanna from me , purple . Funny . Your clones made jokes too ... At first . If you try to run , you 'll end up like them . If i don 't , you 'll kill me . Oh , i don 't want you dead . Oh , so i 'm misinterpreting the big pile of parts That looks just like me . I don 't care about you . I care about the hunt . Oh , well , there 's no sport in hunting my clones . I mean , come on . Look at this girl . She 's a lover , not a fighter . After years idle in deep space , I thought it best to start small . I 've begun to move on to more challenging prey . [ liquid bubbling ] You 're going to help me hunt . - What is that ? - A control stem . It keeps you shape-takers docile . I won 't let you . - Yes , you will . - No , i mean it . You 'll have to kill me . [ chuckles ] no . Your will to live is much too strong . - Show me your neck . - No . If you don 't , i 'll snap it . [ suspenseful music ] ¶ ¶ [ gasps ] [ screaming ] [ gasping and grunting ] Very good . [ shudders ] Very good . Now pull the ax from your belt . [ grunts ] [ gasping ] ¶ ¶ What are you going to make me- - Remain silent . Please your empty hand on the ledge . ¶ ¶ Now raise the ax . [ ominous music ] Above the hand . ¶ ¶ Higher . ¶ ¶ Higher . ¶ ¶ Higher . ( t 'evgin ) enough ! Come , shape-taker ! Go ahead . [ ax clanging ] Explain . Remember when i used your drone to heal nolan and irisa ? Well , your sweet daughter here kept a copy of my source print And used it to make clones . - Dirty birdie . - Stop talking . [ speaking native language ] Go back to town ; tell no one of what you found here . Protect my interests at all costs . [ tense music ] ¶ ¶ What were you thinking ? At least now i have your attention . - You are forbidden to feed . - Why ? Indogene were created for that very purpose . And what about the votans in defiance ? The ones you slaughtered ? - Lower races . - Sentient races . You know how intoxicating and disorienting The hunt can be . You never told me how great the hunger can be Once you 've fed for the first time . Because i want more for you than that ! More than what we truly are ? Than what we are meant to be ? You have turned your back on our people . I will lead them into a new age , One without a harvest , One that will not end in our own extinction . I wonder what the others will think of you when they awake ? They will think i 'm a pragmatist . And then when you order them to lay in the filth Beside the animals it is their right to feed upon ? We will not be denied our true nature . [ device buzzing ] Yes ... You will ! [ dramatic music ] [ device whirring ] ¶ ¶ [ whimpering ] And i am tired of teaching you . Good-bye , kindzi .

That she did . Here . Pretend you 're selling to me . Thank you . For the pardon . Don 't thank me . Thank your husband . Oh , you can 't . He 's dead . For what it is worth , i regret the incident in your office . Not yet , you don 't . [ gagging ] [ exhales ] About last night ... All right . [ plastic rustling ] [ footsteps tapping ] Get to talking , t 'evgin . What do you know about this beast ? There will be no more killings . Seems you could 've mentioned knowing about ' em When you walked into my crime scene Or when your daughter took off running after the beast . There 'll be no more killings . - I got your word on that ? - You have my word . On your daughter 's life ? On my daughter 's life . Thank you , t 'evgin . No ! No , not good enough . I 'm gonna see justice for the people who 've died . The dead are dead , and nothing can change that . I have said all that i need to say . ( amanda ) nolan ! What are you doing ? He knows more than he 's letting on . [ suspenseful music ] Don 't you , t 'ev ? I will afford you one opportunity To pull that trigger . I recommend that you do not miss . [ laughs ] [ grunts ] [ grunting ] You can see yourselves out . ( amanda ) come on . [ door rattles and creaks ] Did you find what you needed ? Went barking up the wrong tree . The victim was an indogene but definitely not a clone . No , i saw the same results that you did . Well , i accidently contaminated the dna sample . What 's this thing on your neck ? Bling . Makes me feel girlish . No , what happened down in old st . Louis ? Did the omec do something to you ? Yes , they did . Ohh ... [ coughs ] I 'm sorry , samir .

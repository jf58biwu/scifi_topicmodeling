 He is looking better already . Maybe . Still hasn 't said a word . It 's gonna take time . They 've got the best doctors in the world here . It 's gonna happen . - Nervous ? - No . Maybe ... a little bit . No . Are you turning soft on me ? No , I can 't . I 'm on call . I thought this was a celebration . It is , kinda . ... the world awaiting anxiously for Alterplex to launch what the company claims to be the final generation of energy solutions . If you 're joining us now , we are less than a minute away from entering a new future . This is really big for me . I want it to be good for you guys , too . - You know ? - I know . And I 'm proud of you . I think . Alterplex gives the green light . Hey , Donny ? Donny , come stand here . T minus 15 . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six ... Thanks for being here . Are you kidding ? ... two ... Oh , it 's okay . What 's it doing ? It 's working . Okay , okay . Ooh , shit . Ah , I 'm exiting the lab . Oh , ah . Unidentified male body . Identified as Dr. Klintsen . Oh , God . Shit . This is Will Porter , mission log one . Uncertain as to my coordinates . The jump was most likely successful , but I can 't confirm . Personal BCI non responsive . New BCI procured , but battery depleting . Writing is mirrored . Either I 'm in the echo , or I 've sustained serious cerebral damage during jump . The lab appears critically damaged . Destruction appears recent . Multiple deceased scattered among the rubble , including Dr. Klintsen . Heading outside to try and confirm coordinates . This is mission log two , outside of lab . More deceased here . Oh , God . I have a visual on the tower . Before executing the objectives , I need to verify if this is really the echo . Shit ! Sorry , buddy . - Will ? - Abby ? - Oh , my God , Will ! - What ... ? What happened ? We thought you were dead . Where are you ? We 'll come and get you . Wait , Abby , I need to know what happened . Where have you been ? The lab was attacked , Will . The box was destroyed . We moved to a camp on the outside of ... Wait , back up . What 'd you say about the box ? I said they destroyed the box . Destroy it ? How ? Who 's " they " ? They shot the place up , Will . I saw it . Are you sure the box was destroyed ? I 'm sending you our coordinates . What the fuck is going on ? Alterplex cares . We understand . The future of mankind is not out there . It is in here , and we have found the solution . We have developed a clean and simple way of converting mass into pure energy . In just a few more months , we will launch our energy tower , powering our world for millennia to come . Alterplex Energy . Clean . Simple . Safe . Mr. Porter . Abigail Vos , Chief of Alterplex Operations . - Welcome . - Thank you . I believe you 're familiar with my partner . Dr. Klintsen ! This is a great honor , sir . You know , I was researching at NASA when you introduced duplicate matter theory . That was the finding of the decade , sir . You 're a rock star down there . We are very excited you 're here , Will . Mr. Reynard apologizes that he couldn 't be meeting you in person . Sure . Hi . I have a lot of questions . Your people were very good at keeping me in the dark . Well , these people are in the dark , too . So ... A physicist who can fly . It 's no wonder NASA poached you from the Air Force . It 's impressive . Thank you . Sorry , what 's going on ? These NASA assessments claim you have little to no risk aversion , a similar view held by your flight school instructors . Those assessments are classified . Wait , is this some kind of a job interview ? 'Cause , you know , I appreciate the mystery flights and everything , but I could 've saved you all a lot of time and trouble . I ... I am not interested , thank you . You haven 't heard our offer . I have a number of obligations back in the United States , personal ones . We are aware of your sister and nephew and your new surrogate father role . And the surrounding circumstances . It 's very noble of you , Will . Mr. Reynard respects your position , Which is why our generous relocation package includes all three of you . Donny will have access to world-class private school ... It 's a little more complicated than that . And the finest trauma specialists in all of Europe . With the compensation we 're prepared to offer , your sister would never need to work . Will , this is not a job offer . This is the opportunity to explore ... impossible frontiers . Well , I 've already been to space , so ... Space is possible . Then , what are we talking about ? Well , for that , I 'm gonna need your signature . Hi ! You 've reached Mia and Donny . We 're not here right now , so please leave a message after the ... beep ! Mia , it 's Will . Just call me when you get this . This is Will Porter , mission log three . I can now confirm that the jump was successful . My location is the echo . Unprecedented . This is amazing . Echo diagnostics is still loading , currently at 57 % . Answer on gravitational stability forthcoming . Eight kilometers from the tower . ETA , just over an hour . What the fuck is going on , man ? Oh , my God . Just get out of here . Okay , just get to the tower . Just get this done . You can get out of here and go home , okay ? Oh , crap . Oh , my God . What the hell is going on ? It was them . There was a lot of shouting . A lot of confusion . And then they just starting shooting ! At first , it looked like they were shooting , and they were going after Alterplex guys , but I saw a woman hit just getting out of her car , and I 'm pretty sure they had nothing to do with Alterplex . The leader of the militant environmental group calling themselves the Rebels , put out a statement today justifying their assault on the Alterplex laboratory and tower , accusing the energy plant of endangering the entire planet by turning on its tower a week ago , citing the subsequent destabilization of the system . Meanwhile , Alterplex , which has been allowed to deploy its own security drones after issuing the controversial Alterplex Security Act , made a joint announcement with the police that the evacuation zone surrounding the tower has been increased to 75 kilometers . Oh , my God , what the ... ? Mission log four . Just had possible visual on a gravitational anomaly . And the box is still loading . Approaching anomaly . Definitely some sort of gravitational portal at the base of the cloud line . Seems to be active still . Lots of static charge , a tendril or a jet , like a tornado , but ionized . Moving towards the anomaly now . Looks like a small ... boat ? Numerous deceased birds surrounding the anomaly . All right . Uh , the boat is mainly intact , so maybe inverse gravity portal is still really active . It seems to be sucking the atmosphere ... Shit ! God ! Oh , my ... Ow ! Shit . What are you doing ? Drone down ! Drone down ! Everybody regroup ! Come on ! - Who 's that guy ? - What ? Where ? - Take him out now ! - Wait , wait , wait . - It 's all right . It 's okay . - Move away from the door ! I 'm just trying to find a way ... That 's right , hold your hands high . Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Stop ! Stop it ! I know you 're in the house ! I know you 're there ! Give you three seconds ! Michael ? Will ? Why are you shooting at me ? You want to put that gun down and tell me what the fuck is going on ? What are you doing with these psychos ? You 're Alterplex ! You 're alive . That ... that 's not possible . Why not ? Why not ? What happened ? Michael , talk to me . Tell me what you saw . Tell me , did something happen to me ? Michael ? What the hell is happening here , man ? - Wait , wait wait ... - What the hell is happening ? Put the gun down . Put the gun down . I 'll tell you what 's happening , but first , you gotta answer me ! Bullshit . How did you survive ? How did you survive ? Shit . Warning , citizen , you are trespassing in a restricted area . You are violating Alterplex Security Act 7.1 . Stop , or we will engage . You are trespassing in a restricted area . Stop , or we will shoot . I work for Alterplex . My name is Will Porter . Remain where you are . We have that name listed as deceased . Take four steps forward and lay face down , arms and legs spread . Wait , wait , wait . Let me prove it to you . Let me prove it to you . Positive identification . You are under arrest . Remain where you are . A transport is on its way . It will escort you to Alterplex Command in a few seconds . Remain where you are . Since the dawn of humankind , we have reached for dreams beyond our grasp . We gazed at the birds and built planes to fly . We gazed at the moon and built rockets to reach it . Throughout history , we have transcended our evolution with technology , pushing through to new frontiers . Now , Alterplex 's visionary CEO , August Reynard , asks you to gaze at the energy challenge we face and once again push through to a new frontier . After decades of research we are proud to finally unveil the future of energy harnessing and realize our dream for a better tomorrow , powering us for millennia to come . This is a notification for all Alterplex personnel . Reminder . Due to the increased violent protests , the emergency security policy will now also include sectors five ... - Yes ! - ... seven , and ten . Uh , no , we are not ready at all . We 're still waiting on the diagnostics report . Well , I 'll check on in . I 'll check him . Yeah . Okay . So glad you 're here , Will . I 'm sorry , launch logistics clock is ticking . How are Mia and Donny adjusting ? Well , little up and down , to tell you the truth . You know , new city and everything . They have a lot of questions . And , frankly , I still don 't fully understand what I 'm doing here myself . Oh , before we go any further , this is for you . It 's not a gift , I 'm afraid . It 's a locator . Keep it on at all times . Once we 're live , you 're on call 24 / 7 . - 24 / 7 ? - Exactly . Shall we proceed ? - All right . - Reminder . As we close in on our launch date ... Ms. Vos , beautiful day , isn 't it ? You must be Will . Michael . Welcome to Alterplex . You can 't stay here . Should keep movin ' . Look at what they 've done ! What about what you did , Michael ? We raided the lab . What happened to you ? There 's a lot of dead people . You can 't be here . There 's just no way ... Why is there no way ? You asked me how I survived . You said it 's not possible I 'm alive . Why ? I saw you die , Will . I saw you die . Come on . What is this ? What in hell is really going on down here ? Run it , please . After the end of fossil fuels , mankind is faced with its greatest challenge yet . With world energy consumption tripling in the last decade alone , a new form of sustainable energy is needed , a system that outshines solar , wind , and even nuclear energy . After years of research , we at Alterplex have found the answer to this energy crisis by leveraging the immense hidden power Of M-theory , first proposed by Edward Widden in 1995 , and enhanced by Peter Klintsen 's duplicate matter theory . M-theory unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory . By deconstructing space time into a higher number of dimensions , our tower is able to create a mirrored echo of our local universe ... You 're copying the entire universe ? ... following its symmetry down to every last quantum particle , with one crucial difference : the echo universe will be devoid of organic compounds . Instead , it will be a lifeless cosmos , providing a limitless amount of matter that can be transformed into power . Acting as a dimensional conductor , the tower will create multiple gravity portals which will harvest the echo 's mass and convert it into pure electromagnetic energy . This energy will then be transferred cleanly and safely into our world , powering it for millennia to come . I had the exact same face . - Parallel universes ? - An echo universe . And this here is where you come in . This is the gate . It sends you into the echo a safe distance from the tower . You will be carrying this box . The box will counterbalance any instabilities - that might occur in the echo . - Instabilities ? Very simple , though it plugs right into the echo tower . Someone needs to get it there . Huh . May I ? And just plug it in ? That 's it ? That 's it . There 's a terminal at the base of the echo tower . You jump over , take the box to the tower , plug it in , and jump back in time for dinner . Michael , nobody was supposed to have been copied , no living thing . This was supposed to be a sterile world , devoid of carbon life . I don 't know what went wrong . So you 're saying that ... Hmm ? They 've copied the entire world . - Well ... kind of . - The entire universe . How 's that even possible , man ? You really don 't want to get into that right now , but , effectively , yes . Yes . So there 's two of me . Possibly . - Of everyone . - Well , not everyone . Not me , anymore , I guess , but I 'm here to fix that . I have to get this to the tower . Huh ... " Redivider . " What does it mean ? I don 't know . They didn 't brief me on Redivider . What about shit like this , man ? They never briefed you about trains falling out of the fucking sky . Listen , the system should 've been one way , harvesting energy from the echo , from this universe into the real world , but maybe the echo is fighting back somehow ? It 's sucking stuff back ? Heavy objects from the real world ... Maybe it 's balancing out what 's lost . Jesus Christ . No one 's going to believe this . Because no one is gonna know . - What do you mean ? - Can you imagine the panic ? Look what 's happening already . People would freak out . We have to say something . No , we don 't have to say shit . Goddamn ! Look , if you really want to end this , you have to help me get the box to the tower . - Shit ! Who 's this ? - Michael ! Michael , put the gun down . - Abby . Abby ! - What the ... Michael , easy . Easy . This is crazy . They destroyed the lab , Will . - You destroyed the goddamn wor ... - Shut up ! Shut the fuck up ! We cannot trust her , Will . Don 't trust her . Reynard is waiting with what 's left of the team . - We 're regrouping . - No , no ... - The plan failed , Will , badly . - I know . Come with me , and we will fix this . Abby , no . Abby , I can 't . - Gotta go . - You have been identified . Lie on the ground and place your hands over your head . Hey , it 's me ! What the fuck is wrong with you ? I 'm bringing him in ! Go , go , go ! Run ! We see you . Lie on the ground and place your hands over your head . This is your last warning . - Come back ! - No ! Get in the car ! Come on , get in ! Abby , let 's go ! Come on ! Run ! Come on ! Goddamn you ! He 's coming in ! Shoot ! Come on ! Shoot it ! Oh , God , it 's damaging the hull ! - Are you out ? - It 's out . It 's out . My pack . Use the grenade . Throw the grenade ! Throw the grenade ! Get to that bridge faster . Faster ! Shit ! Unmute . The disappearance is the latest in a line of recent reports of vehicles gone missing , a bizarre pattern which seems to be linked to abnormal weather behaviors surrounding the sites , according to some experts . Some skeptics believe the events are linked to the Alterplex Energy tower launch last week . He wanted to wait up for you . Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry . We 'll get to it this weekend , I promise . They 're giving you weekends off now ? I think he 's a little homesick . Yeah ? Well , it 'll get better . And I swear I 'm gonna do something about all this stuff . Okay ? You should get out and enjoy the city a bit . Have you taken him on the canals yet ? We 'll be fine , Will . You okay ? Bleeding . Shit . It 's fine . It 's fine . You all right ? We have to bring you to Reynard . He 'll know what to do . Reynard and his team just tried to put us in a coma ! Because you attacked us ! - Will ? - They were aiming at me , Abby . Why ? You 're one of us . Not anymore , Abby . Just get me into the tower . The tower . What are you gonna do without the box ? They destroyed it ! Just trust me . I can fix this . He can fix it . But without Reynard and Alterplex . Without them ! We 're getting in there , Abby . I can end this , all right ? He can end it . Okay . Will . Hi ! You 've reached Mia and Donny . We 're not here right now , so please leave a message after the ... beep ! Mia , it 's me again . Please call me as soon as you can . Okay ? I love you . They evacuated . I made sure of it myself . Drone patrolling the building . Shh . Fuck . We have to move out of the open . Go ! Shh . Safe . Let 's go ! We are not the military . We are an energy corporation . Now , the rebels , they 're anarchists ! This statement given by Alterplex CEO August Reynard condemning the environmental group which attacked ... If you find any water , take it . ... viewed as highly controversial . News reports from the city are hard to verify due to the strictly enforced exclusion zone . Vehicles seemly appearing out of thin air and dropping from the sky sound like ideas out of science fiction , yet many eyewitnesses have reported these phenomenon . The authorities are taking These accounts very , very seriously ... Jesus Christ . Oh , my God . Who moved these bodies here ? Oh , God . Alterplex . Alterplex Security , for sure . I 've seen similar sites . At first , we thought it was just a freak thing , but then they kept coming and coming . After a while , just gave up . I didn 't even know about this one . Too many bodies . That 's when I quit . I don 't blame you . On the other side ... is it like this ? No , just these vehicles went missing . That 's why Alterplex sent me . So , it 's not ... I 'm not ... ? Like I said , as far as I know , the other you is alive . I don 't know . Jesus . You okay ? Shit ! This way , this way ! We got a drone ! He spotted us ! Aw , shit ! Let 's get in the plane ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Let 's go , let 's go ! Come on ! ... require ground support at grid two . ... require ground support at grid two . Stay down . Stay down . Stand by for final position . On red and shoot to kill . Repeat , shoot to kill . Visual on targets . Engaging . - You okay ? - Yeah . Okay . Goddamn . We have to go . Go . Let 's go . Move ! They know where we are . You okay ? We 're clear . Whew ! Goddamn it . Drone ! Drone ! Face the drone and place your weapon on the ground . Back me up , Will ! Back me up ! Shit ! I 'm out . Charge your rifle , Will ! Fire the charge ! Look out ! What 's it doing ? It 's working . Hey , Donny , you see that ? See that beam of light ? That is pure energy that has been sucked down into the tower . That 's gonna power the whole city here , maybe the whole country . Sucking it from where ? Well ... Will Porter , you are now on call . The group 's leader , Hugo Romein , in an interview this morning ensured that his movement will be monitoring the situation closely . Expressing grave concerns about the tower initiation , he went on to vow that his group would take action at the first sign of trouble , although he did not say what form that action would take . Will ... Will , listen , stay with me . - Stay with me . - Shit ... We 've gotta pull it out , okay ? Abby , we pull it out . The blood 'll be worse . One , two ... Stop , stop . He 'll bleed to death if you pull it out . You think that you can walk ? There 's no way he 'll make it to the tower . We need to get him real help . Will , Will , Will , stay with us . Wait , wait , wait . Wait , I know a place . It 's just a few blocks from here . A place ? No , no , no , it 's me . It 's Michael . I got an injured man here . Carry him . You brought us here ? I had no choice . Okay ? He 's bleeding to death . Weapons down , please . Weapons down , come on ! His name 's Will . Where 's Hugo ? Will . Come on , all your weapons down . Where 's Hugo ? That 's not my problem . I 'd tell you , but we need the medic before he bleeds out . - I 'm telling you , Hugo ! - Okay . Come on , leave her alone . Don 't you fucking touch me . - Shit ... - She 's unarmed . Okay . Take them inside . Clear the table , come on ! Sit down , Will . Look out for your leg . Up ! Please be careful with him . We need him . Is the muscle damaged ? Give him a shot of propofol and IV floxacillin . Okay . Fixate his leg . Okay , now , gently . One , two ... Yeah , it 's not working . We need to apply side pressure . Okay , try it again . Oh ... - Shit . Oh , it 's out . - Okay . Try to relax , bro . Try to relax . - Hand me the scissors ? - Trust me , you 're gonna be okay . I 'll prepare the leg , make sure he doesn 't lose too much blood . Yep , prepare the leg . On my count . Gauze . Nurse , gauze , please . Couple of minutes , you 'll be as good as new . Who will stand up for her ? Who speaks for Earth when multinationals exploit her resources for profit ? Who speaks for our planet when ... - Mia ? - ... rape her while pulling the wool over everyone 's eyes ? Mia , what are you watching this for ? Mia , what 's the matter ? Nothing , I 'm ... I 'm fine . I 'm sorry . Donny wrote this today . Are the kids still teasing him at school ? It 's not the teasing , Will . It 's this whole place , this situation , these things that are happening . You 've been so good to us , and you don 't owe us anything , and I think maybe it 's time that ... No . Come on . I don 't want Donny and I to stand in the way of something that 's so important to you . Mia , if he misses home , we 'll go back on a trip . Let me go talk to him , okay ? - Hey ! - What happ ... what ? How long have I been out ? Who are you ? No , we have to ... we don 't have a lot of time . - Hey . - Whoa , easy . Who are you ? You have to let us go . We need to get out of here right now . You work for Alterplex , just like her ? You need to let us go now . Tell him . - Tell him . - Yeah , tell me . - Who do you work for ? - What ? Come on , Michael . - Tell him . - Michael . Michael , come on . We need to go . We need to get out of here . Who is this guy ? What are you doing ? No , no , no . Don 't . What are you do ... ? Are you listening to me ? We have to go ! We have to get that thing to the tower ! Redivider ? What is this ? That 's impossible . What is not possible ? What is this ? Come on . You bring these people in here , and you can 't explain what this is ? Hugo , he told me he could help . - Did you sell us out , Mike ? - No , I swear . - Did you sell us out ? - No , I didn 't . Trust me , I know what I 'm doing . - Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa ! - They can help . - Hugo , trust me . - They can help ? Help bring us this tracking device here ? Help us all get killed ? What is this ? Shit ! Where 's the box ? Michael , come on . We gotta get out of here . Let 's go , go , go , go , go ! Come on , guys , move ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Come on , this way . Michael , let 's go . Let 's get the fuck out of here ! I don 't believe they won 't believe me . Abby , come on ! Let 's go , go , go ! - Come on , move in ! - Michael . Attention , you 're harboring a wanted individual . You are in breach of the active Alterplex security order . Shit . Stay down , stay down . Okay . Yeah . Let 's go . Go , go , go , go , go ! Abby , come on . Clear ! This way ! Abby . Abby ! I couldn 't tell you about the box . I know an escape tunnel nearby ! Shit . Let 's go ! Come on ! Drone left ! Give me the box , Will . Gotta move ! We gotta move , come on ! Why are you standing there ? Come on ! Come on ! We gotta go down . Come on in , quick . Abby . Abby ! What was I supposed to do ? Abby , what was I supposed to do ? I couldn 't tell you about the box once I knew I was in the echo . You weren 't even supposed to be here ! Nobody was supposed to be alive here . Stop ! No , you stop . Redivider ... What is Redivider ? Huh ? What is it ? You sent me here . You sent me here . Now , you tell me what is Redivider . It 's a classified protocol , a last resort . When restoring balance is impossible ... the box disables one side altogether . It destroys the tower . And this universe . There 's only one option left . Redivider aborts one universe to ensure the other survives . Jesus Christ . This thing is a goddamn kill switch . Hey , bud . I got your note . And I miss home , too . Truth is , Don ... I don 't even really know where home is anymore . Will Porter , please call in as soon as possible . You know , Donny , there are a lot of very important , very smart people in these towers . And they wanted Uncle Will to move halfway across the world ... Move our home halfway across the world ... to be part of a very special project . It 's something that could help a lot of people , you know ? Maybe even change the world . And I thought maybe I could help you and your mom , too . That 's a big responsibility . It 's maybe the biggest responsibility of my life . Will Porter , please call in as soon as possible . Really ? For me ? Thanks , man . So , you sent me on a suicide mission ? I am tired of being fucked around , Abby . I am done ! Where did my family go , huh ? Where are they , Abby ? Will , where are you going ? Oh , shit ! What 's happening ? Where are you going ? You said they evacuated , right ? Donny , my sister , they evacuated . Will , this is a bad idea . I am too close to home . No , you 're not thinking clearly . This is a bad idea . It 's getting worse . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! It 's ... it 's like it 's coming apart at the seams ! What the ... ? - Holy shit ! - I gotta get to them ! Don 't go ! Please stay with us . Get out of my way ! No , no , no , no , no , no , no ! Oh , my God . Mia ! Mia ! Donny ! I should never have dragged you guys here . I am done . - Done ? - Yeah . I 've been so selfish . We 're gonna get through this . I don 't wanna just get through this , Mia . You and Donny deserve way better . Please , I didn 't mean for this to become a big thing . Mia , it 's a huge deal . You 're my sister , and I promised to look after you . I ... I ... I don 't feel like I 've done a very good job . We 're going home , all of us . Are you sure ? First thing in the morning . I 'm gonna quit and ... we 'll get on the first plane out of here , okay ? Thank you . What kind of person are you ? You said they evacuated . You said you made sure of it yourself . You lied to me . What 's that ? What 's it doing ? I 'm sorry . Wait here . Shit ! What the hell 's going on ? Critical failure of protocol ! You 're going in ! Will ! I guess that resignation 'll have to wait . I 'm sorry . Where are they taking you ? Porter , you have to go now ! Will ! Will ! Traitor . We got Porter . What about the box ? Is it safe ? Yeah , it 's safe . Good . Good . Don 't let it out of your sight . What should I do with him ? Just like we discussed . Copy . Take him up front . Hello , Will . Whatever he says , don 't listen to him . Don 't trust him . Jordan , let 's go . It 's an interesting ... strange ... beautiful paradox . Those two worlds conjoined like twins ... just from the womb . We have to sacrifice one ... so the other may endure . You 're going to sacrifice the original universe . You 're destroying my world so you can live ? Fuck you . We need your help , Will . There is still time . Time for what ? You think I 'd actually help you ? With everything I know now ? I know . This is a difficult decision . Difficult ? Difficult ? ! Killing my family is difficult ? That 's why going back is the only solution . You can see them again . You 're the only one who can pilot the jump . There is no third option . If we remain here in this stalemate , both worlds soon cease to exist . We have to sacrifice one to save the other . Yes . Yes , Mr. Porter , your family will die . I 'm only offering you the opportunity to be there . Hold their hands in the end . One must be sacrificed so the other can live . That works for me . Michael , hold on to something now ! There . What happened ? Where is Porter ? Where is the box ? Where is the box ? Shoot me . Shoot me . Take this . We gotta move . You know what I need to do , right ? Exactly what you 've gotta do . You know what this means ? Kill switch . That 's okay . I need to right some wrongs , anyway . He 's still shooting ! Drive ! Drive ! Hold on ! Michael , you okay ? Oh , shit , I 'm hit ! I 'm hit ! Stop the car . Here , you take the wheel . Let 's go . Let 's go ! Move ! Will ! Will , are you okay ? Will ? Shit ! Shit , drones ! Shoot ! Will , shoot the nose . Shoot the nose ! Shoot the nose ! It controls the other drones . Come on , Will ! Look , we 're almost there . Oh , shit ! You get to the tower , Will , and you end this ! You end this , Will ! Truth is , Donny , they wanted Uncle Will to be part of a very special project . It 's something that could help a lot of people , you know ? Maybe even change the world . And I thought maybe I could help you and your mom , too . That 's a big responsibility . It 's maybe the biggest responsibility of my life . I don 't want Donny and I to stand in the way of something that 's so important to you . I 've been so selfish . You 've been so good to us , and you don 't owe us anything , and I think maybe it 's time ... If he misses home , we 'll go back on a trip . You 're my sister , and I promised to look after you ... I don 't fee ! like I 've done a very good job . We 're going home , all of us . I promise I can fix this . I can 't let you do it , Will , I 'm sorry . I can 't let you destroy this world . This world is already dying . This cannot be the end . Do you realize what you 're doing ? Yes . I 'm keeping a promise . Shit . What the fuck . You 've killed us all !

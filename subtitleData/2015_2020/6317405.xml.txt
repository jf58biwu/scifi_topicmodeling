 Hey , this is Claire . Leave me a message and I 'll call you back . Hey , it 's your dad . I know it 's been a few years since we 've talked , and ... I don 't know if you 're still mad or ... I don 't really know anything . I just know ... I miss you . I 'm sure there 's plenty of apologies to go around , but to be honest with you , I 'm not interested in who was right or wrong anymore . So much has changed since I saw you last . I don 't know whether those changes are good or bad , but I really think it has a chance to all work out . And knowing how important you 've been to all of this , to so many people out there , it 's made me proud . And I just wanted to call and tell you how excited I am that we might be seeing each other . When you look back at the things you 've done , the decisions you 've made ... Whoa . The last thing you want to feel is regret , am I right ? I 'll see you soon , Claire-bear . on little Odessa , Texas . Headquarters of Primatech , the global leaders of evo research . The dream for peace between humans and evos - has shattered in seconds . - Massive evidence ... Odessa ... A once thriving city in central Texas ... Why did this have to happen ? It was a despicable and cowardly act ... - Reduced to a wasteland ... - These are the seeds of hate that we cannot let take root in our heart . This horrific attacks are a grim reminder ... Tyrants and terrorists with strength . And so we are newly reminded that serious threats to our way of life remain . Make no mistake , we will get to the bottom of this ... Claire ! To bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice . June 13th will certainly go down in history as one of the worst terrorist attacks ... - Will hunt down and punish ... - Claire ! - Those responsible . - Will be brought to justice . - Hunt them down and kill them . - Kill ' em all ! Claire ! Don 't see him ? Coach Lewis ? - Jeez . - You got to be kidding me . - Odessa , a once - thriving city in central Texas , reduced to a desolate wasteland by a cowardly act ... - Password . - Of evil terrorism . Cockroach ? Why Odessa ? It was the headquarters of Primatech , a company steeped in secrecy . Primatech opened its doors on June 13th for what was to be a three-day summit . People gathered from all around the world , hoping to build a better future where humans and evos could coexist in peace . Within hours , an evil supremacist named Mohinder Suresh claimed full responsibility for the attacks . - Lies . - All of it . This is pathetic . How the hell are we supposed to fight back if we can 't even organize ? We just got to get creative . There 's a guy in Los Angeles fighting back , calls himself " El Vengador . " That dude in the mexican wrestler costume ... That 's a joke , right ? - Is it ? - At least he 's doing something . I hear he 's got a whole underground railroad out there , fake IDs , fake blood samples ... It 's a way to disappear . One guy , so what ? Pretty soon , they 'll send drones after us . June 13th changed everything . The public 's scared to death of us . Most of these incidents are isolated ... Tulsa , Cedar Rapids ... The vigilantes , a few bad apples ... that 's all . If it was just vigilantes , the government wouldn 't be forcing us to register . People don 't get it . It 's not the government or the vigilantes we should be worried about . The ones really hunting us , they 're in the shadows . There 's something else going on here . And they 're everywhere . That 's just great . So what are we supposed to do with that , chase ghosts ? My mom sleeps with a gun under her pillow , when she sleeps at all . And we use fake names most of the time . I 'm calling myself " Tommy " now . No names , for God 's sakes . Now we 're wanted in three states , all because I can 't control my power . I came here tonight because I thought maybe someone could give me a few tips , help me out a little . You came to the wrong place , my friend . I got to go . My mom ... Sorry . Hey , look out ! - I 'm so sorry . - Come on . I 'm really sorry . - It 's lies , just lies . - You believe everything . You can 't have a revolution without casualties . Resistance is our only answer , - by any means possible . - Exactly . We need to stop acting like victims here . We 're the ones with powers . Suresh was right . We are the future . The future ... That 's a good one . On june 13th , my wife and I , we brought our nine-year-old son Dennis to Odessa to watch history being made . It was a beautiful day . Sun was shining . Summer heat was rising up off the ground . Like everyone there , we believed in the cause . We believed that the change could come from that spot right then and there . And then when I watched my ... my boy die in my arms , I realized that that just wasn 't gonna happen . You all seem like really nice folks . You can 't change who you are , what you are . But these powers ... They 're not natural . They 're not safe , and they cannot be trusted . So as far as I 'm concerned , there 's only one solution for that . And what solution is that ? Run ! They found us ! One of ' em got away . Dropped this . Moe 's Ice Cream Parlor . Carbondale , Illinois . One more , and we got free ice cream . For Dennis . The good ones fill your life with meaning , with context , with clarity , while other memories can deceive . The ones that make you believe you know the truth , they 're the dangerous ones , the ones that hold you hostage . When you look back on all the decisions you 've made in your life , the one thing you don 't want to feel ... is regret . Am I right ? It 's why this car makes so much sense . Gas mileage , style , safety ... It 's got it all , not to mention that new-car smell . What do you think , young lady ? Okay . Let 's head back into my office . Leasing office , pick up line 3 , please . Leasing office , line 3 . So can I get started on the paperwork ? I 'd like to check the safety stats on the car first . You 've probably got kids , right , Mr. Barnes ? Linda , you 're amazing . - It 's Lisa . - Lisa , yeah , right . We got to stop . - Why ? Why ? - What 's wrong ? Lunchtime , you 're on in five . All I know about being a hero is it 's not something you 're born with . And if you had told me when I was your age that I 'd be getting a Medal of Valor for saving three soldiers from an ambush in Afghanistan , I 'd have said you were nuts . Here I am . I 'd like to thank Principal Marks and Miss ... Miss ... - Carpenter . - Right . For giving me such a warm welcome today . I 'll leave you with this last thought . It doesn 't matter how ordinary you think you are or how much of a screwup you think you 've been . We all have the potential to be heroes . Thank you . - You want to ? - Yes . Okay . Hey ! Brad ... Hey . - You like my girlfriend ? - What ? You 're staring at my girlfriend . No , I wasn 't staring . Wuss . They said his wife didn 't even know he was in Chicago . Did something happen ? Coach Lewis died in a fire last night with six other people . I 've been here an hour now . The other guy told me to wait . Waiting . Too many people go through life waiting for things to happen instead of making them happen . Now , let 's talk about what you saw . I 'm riding my bike down H Street with my delivery when this little prick runs right into me . 28 bucks worth of food on the ground . He came running out of that church right before it caught fire , so I 'm guessing he killed all those people . Could you identify this " prick " if you saw him again ? Is there a reward ? Go ahead . - I don 't understand . - What 's this for ? Penny for your thoughts . All right . So let 's see if we can get a description of that kid you saw . Kid ? Sorry , I don 't remember anything about a kid . Hey . You 're the ice cream junkie , right ? What ? Well , you 're at Moe 's all the time . Yeah , I guess I like ice cream . So it 's not because of me . I 'm just messing with you . I 'm the one who drew the happy face on your punch card . I know . Hey , we need a new scooper . You should come in . They 're letting me do the interviews . Okay . Yeah . Maybe . Um , hey , I heard about what Brad did to you . I 'm sorry . Brad acts like a tough guy , but he 's not . He 's just ... A total narcissistic jerk ? Sometimes . Yeah . Hey , did you hear what they 're saying about Coach Lewis , that he might have been an evo ? An evo ? Evolved , had powers . Really ? Well , I got to get to a French Club meeting . But seriously , you should come in for that job . Brad . - Hi . - Hey . - Want me to pick you up ? - Sure . - Come on . Hurry up . - Let 's go . Why don 't you ever stay with us when you 're in town ? It 's complicated . If you came back , you could work at the shop . I don 't know . I think your dad 's still pretty sore at me . He 's probably over it now that you 're a hero . Hero . But you 're like El Vengador . What , the guy in the mexican wrestling mask ? You comparing me to an evo ? They say anyone could turn out to be an evo . They were just born that way . There 's this website called " HeroTruther . " And they 're tracking how all these evos are starting to disappear . Someone 's taking them , maybe even killing them . El Vengador 's the only one taking care of this neighborhood , the only one the gangbangers are scared of . All right , I 've heard enough about El Vengador . I 've seen enough too . Is that yours , Jose ? Yes . But people need to know he 's not in hiding like the rest of them . No , people need to come to a garage without graffiti on the wall . Now clean it up . So the kid 's got a hero , someone to look up to . What 's the problem ? El Vengador isn 't everybody 's hero . The tag is bad for business . And what 's Jose need a caped crusader to idolize when he 's got Tío Carlos ? Hey , Oscar ! I think she 's a lost cause . Transmission 's shot . - I don 't know . - You hear that ? What ? I can hear an air lift there . Just need to replace the vacuum lines to the modulator valve . She should be good to go . Hey , I told Pop to paint the " S " off the word " sons " years ago . Yeah , he figured after you came back from the army , you 'd change your mind . Look , war hero or not , you broke his heart . I hope you know that . Like it was ever gonna be 50 / 50 anyway . - That 's it . - Walk away . You 're real good at that , hero man ! See you later , okay ? I don 't know . If this thing gets to be over 75 people , we might need to rent a tent . Sure it 's not too late to elope ? Sorry . You have been roped and tied , my friend . You hold that thought . What ? I 'll be right back . What is it ? First rule of tailing somebody : know how to tail someone . Who are you ? What do you want ? Answers . Answers to what ? To what really happened on June 13th . What the hell does that have to do with me ? You 're Noah Bennet , right ? Who do you work for ? - Renautas . - Renautas . Well , I worked at Renautas , but not for Renautas . And I know that you worked for Primatech . I sold paper . Sure , along with bagging and tagging and keeping powers under wraps . And you know this how ? Because Renautas secretly owned Primatech . Primatech is dead . It 's a hole in the ground . Unless it 's not . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . June 13th is just the beginning . I just ... I don 't know of what . And your name is on hundreds of memos and shredded documents . You know something about June 13th that nobody else does . Let me guess . You 're a truther , an apologist for Mohinder Suresh . Man ... Suresh had nothing to do with Odessa . He was a patsy . How do you not know that , man ? What did they do to you ? Get a life , and stay out of mine . Wait , I have the manuscript Suresh was just about to publish . How the hell do you have that ? It 's all in here ... How the number of evos is higher on the planet than ever before . These powers ... Their numbers are increasing , escalating . Why ? Is it evolutionary ? Is it because they want to take over , like , the media , like , the government , like , wants us to think ? No . - They 're here to save us ... - Save us ? From whatever it is that Renautas is planning . If that 's true , then where are they ? You see any people with powers around here ? They are all gone . They are hiding or dead . Believe me . If they were here to save us , I would know . Listen to me , man . You called the cops ? - That 's him . - That 's the guy . - On the ground ! - Hands above your head ! You got ... Man ! I said down now ! June 13th did not happen like they say it did . You listen to me . I have been over that day a thousand times . My daughter died on that day . You don 't just forget a day like that . You do , if someone doesn 't want you to remember it . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you , man . Something big 's coming . Something big 's coming ! How do you not know that , man ? Come on , sir , move ! Are you okay ? Yeah , he 's ... He 's just some nut . Let 's go inside . " Ophthalmology . " Relocated from Odessa to Dallas . The masked vigilante known as El Vengador has been spotted again , this time coming to the rescue of a man who passed by a gang member from the 700 block of San Gabriel Boulevard . Killed a lot of people in Odessa last year . We all know that . All I know is , he saved me . Powers or not , the guy 's a hero in my book . Although many believe El Vengador is in fact an evo , authorities are still debating whether or not he 's broken any laws . Oscar ? I don 't understand . You 're El Vengador . Since June 13th , all the world 's gone crazy . Just trying to make a difference . So you 're telling me you have powers . We all have our secrets . What 's going on ? What happened ? My God . It was a trap . They knew I was coming . Who ? Who ? It 's all there . Carlos , listen to me . Jose really looks up to you . He 's gonna need a strong hand . You got to ... What are you even talking about , hey ? We 're gonna get you an ambulance . It 's not just Jose . There 's others . What others ? Someone like you ... You can put on the mask . You 're a hero . I 'm not ... Everything they say about me ... The medal ... all ... No . No . This really is unbelievable . We do all the hard work , and this son-of-a-bitch terrorist gets all the credit . That 's the second time now . I mean , once , that 's a coincidence , but not twice . I 'm gonna die of boredom here . I need to pee . Have fun . You 've really moved around a lot . What are you , like , from some weird , nomadic tribe ? I am , as a matter of fact . Is that a problem ? Okay , let 's start this interview for real . Can you scoop ice cream ? Yeah . - Congratulations . - You 're hired . - Wow , all right . - Thanks so much . My mom 's gonna be really excited . Well , I will get your uniform , and you can start tomorrow . Okay , so I 've got three sizes , and you can try them in the men 's room . Okay , sure . Give me a second . I 'll be right back . I can 't believe we made it out alive . So what happened in there ? All I heard is the place burned down . What do you think happened ? I think we shouldn 't talk about it in public . Good idea . Hey , you forgot to try on your uniforms . Well , it looks like both of you are going for a little ride . - No need . - We 'll take them both now . Hey ! Where are you going ? Where do you think ? Home , to pack and leave like we always do . My God , I am such an idiot , thinking I could have a normal life here . I 'm just ... I 'm sorry . Those people ... Where did they go ? I don 't know . I don 't know where any of it goes . How 's that for the worst power ever ? You saved my life . Tommy ! Tommy ! Your secret ... It 's safe with me . Why didn 't El Vengador stop them ? What good is a hero if he doesn 't help people who need him most ? You would have . I never even got a chance to tell him , to show him . Show him what ? I kind of want to be alone . Can I help you ? Yes , um , I have an odd question . Have I ever been here before ? I don 't believe so , no . Do you mind checking your records ? The name is Ted B ... Bennet . Noah Bennet . I 'm sorry . There 's nothing here under Bennet . Perhaps if you remembered the doctor 's name ? Yeah , you know , I wish I did . " See more clearly . " Sorry . We have no doctor here named Seymour . No . That 's just what 's written on the card . You know , I really think I have been here before . I knew there was something off about this place . - It 's okay . - He 's a friend . René ? There 's a bench across the street . Wait for me there . You left these the last time I saw you . Didn 't know what I was missing . René , what the ... My God . No . Not René . Why were you trying to kill me ? You told me to . What ? You made the perfect plan . You wiped my memory . You needed to forget . What did I need to forget ? What ? It 's coming . It 's coming . - No , René . - René , no , no ! What did I need to forget ? What is it ? René ! Where does it come from , this fear , this quest ... This need to hide in a simpler past ... when the future cannot be avoided ? It 's coming . And when it does ... Everything will change . If there are those who can stop it ... Do we know how ? It 's happening faster than we thought . I don 't think I can control it much longer .

 Time to clean up this mess . Sweet Kurt . On a scale of one to 10 , how incompetent is Jeff ? If we 're going to do this , we have to do it the right way . - I told them where you are . - Which them ? I 'll take care of the traitor . I 'm not letting you out of my sight until I get Walsh . What happened to the girl ? The blonde girl with the ... The tears on her face ? I 'm feeling so guilty , Jeff . II lied to Kelly in Iceland about who I really am . Do you think I should tell her the truth ? Why do we even have to go to a stupid staff meeting ? Did you even hear me , Jeff ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . You left your luggage in Iceberg with Shelly . Who does Eric think he is ... Coming here , changing everything ? What a dick . How do I look ? Good . Her name is Kelly . Clap , clap , clap . See ? Teamwork feels good . Okay , stop . How do we feel ? - Great . - Yeah ... great . Sharing experiences with a coworker increases productivity by 200 % . Okay , here 's today 's inspirational quote . " Follow your dreams , " " but most of all , follow the mission . " Yeah . I have chills . Yeah , me , too . Good meeting . Dismissed ! Jeff , hang back for a second . I like what I 'm seeing from you today , and I have a special assignment . Do you think you 're ready for it ? Yes , absolutely . I am ready . How would you like to clean the storage bay of all its garbage and dispose of it ... permanently ? Junk . Junk . Junk . Get rid of everything . We need the space . Yeah , but the only problem is that 's where we keep Kurt 's body . So it 's ... Everything . Okay . Glimmer says there 's someone after us . And he wants to know where the TV remote is . Maybe we should get out of here . Yeah , but I 'm addicted to the hush puppies here . Just keep the car running . I 'll be back in two minutes . Hey . How quickly can you do a number two , the number four , the number five , and the number six ? Pretty quickly , they 're just sitting right there under the heat lamp . Okay , great . I 'll do that , and an order of the hush puppies , extra crispy . Your hush puppies are ready . Sir , you forgot your order ! Thank you for seeing me , Bishop McNally . My door is always open , Doug . I called because I wanted to talk to you about something that I 'm not proud of . It involves a woman . I 'm in love with her , and I want to leave the church . You don 't have to leave the church if you haven 't done anything yet . We did it . One time . Okay , um ... I forgive you . God forgives you . I don 't think you understand . I 'm feeling a different kind of calling . One where I explore a life with Chelsea ... That 's the woman 's name . Doug , let 's give it some time ? Pray on it . And we 'll revisit this in , say , six to eight months . - Hello . - You owe me an apology . What ? You owe me an apology . You 're the reason I 've got an FBI agent following me around nonstop . This was really on your todo list today ? Feel like you 're kind of messing with me . Just pick a card . It 's for Gina 's birthday . I 'd like for it to be nice . It literally doesn 't matter . She 's gonna read it and put it in the trash can . Listen , I found us a safe place where we can meet ... If you can manage to shake your shadow this time . How am I supposed to do that ? She 's staying in the same hotel as me . Ozzie , you have two Master 's degrees . You 'll figure it out . I 'll text you the info . So is this a date ? What ? Gerry , at group ? It is past 5 : 00 P.M. ? Am I wearing heels ? Did you buy me a drink ? Okay . Good to know . I 'm just glad we 're in public together . Excuse me . Oy , what do I write ? So much pressure . You know , as a journalist , people expect you to write something witty and clever and maybe put in a great quote from a politician or something like that . My God . " Can 't shake Foster . " Walsh wants to meet me alone . Need you to distract her at party . P.S ... Happy birthday . " P.P.S ... Act natural when you read this . " Hi ! - Happy birthday , Gina ! - Hi ! - Happy birthday . - Thank you , guys . I made you a birthday cake this morning , but then I dropped it in the parking lot , so ... But it 's the thought that counts , right ? Yes , thank you , Margaret . And we got you a card . A card . You all ... you all chipped in just for the one ? - Just one card . - Yeah . - Read it out loud . - No ! No , no . Read it to yourself , 'cause mine 's personal . Okay , cool . Very nice sentiment , Ozzie . I did change your life . Would you like to come to my birthday party , Agent Foster ? If he 's there , I 'm there . Okay , well , don 't feel obliged to bring me a gift . I won 't . But just in case , I like body scrubs and Starbucks cards , and cash is never tacky . That goes for everyone . Ooh ! Okay , everybody . Who 's up for some birthday karaoke ? Everyone ? Good , because it 's mandatory . Hey , so Walsh just texted me his location . We need to distract Alex so I can sneak out of here . Don 't worry . We got our best secret agent on it . Tell me about the FBI . What 's that like ? 'Cause I think that would be kind of a good , like , fallback plan for me , if this dance thing , you know , doesn 't work out . They can be rough . Yeah , sometimes you have to spend time in small , boring towns . I 'd hate that . This is gonna be awesome . We 're gonna get new alien info . Hug me , hug me ... She 's watching . Wow , so much love . Gina , I 'm sorry for making you do this on your birthday . It 's okay . I 'm happy to do it if it brings the group closer to the truth . I guess this is it , my ... Kurt . Maybe in some twisted way , this is what I needed to do so that I could finally let go . We had some good times together . Just give it back . I have a lot of stapling to do . Somebody got a haircut . I did ! Thanks for noticing . Bye , sweet Kurt . Car ! What 's happening ? Kurt , you 're alive ! Of course I 'm alive ! What else would I be ? You were dead . No , I wasn 't . Dead , you were dead . - I was ? - So dead . You were dead . I want to thank everyone for being here tonight , and I 'm gonna insist that everyone sing a song and have a drink . That goes for you , Agent Foster . That 's Mama 's birthday wish . When Gina gets a little drunk , she refers to herself as " Mama . " Well , I 'm sorry . But federal law mandates that I recuse myself from karaoke . Whoa , you 're making Mama sad . - Don ? - Not my best . I cannot believe this . Alex , are you okay ? You know what ? Um ... I actually think I will have that drink . - Amazing ! - Yay ! All right , everybody . Birthday shots ! I 'm gonna drink something on fire ! Ooh , okay . I just wanted a chance to explain about Iceland . You mean the giant insane lie about your fake " meuther " dying . Yeah . That 's it . Can we talk outside ? Whoo ! Come on , Alex . Come on up here and sing it with us . They sound crazy . Hey , what about " Don 't Stop Believing " ? Sure , if you want to sound like everyone else . I think , honestly , the key to karaoke is to just pick a song that 's personal to you . Wow , sounds like you got some experience with this . Can I tell you something ? I love karaoke . Get out . I have a trophy at home , a karaoke trophy . Why are you keeping that a secret , Special Agent . You need to get up there . - No . - Yes . I 'm working right now . - No . - I shouldn 't do that . Work the stage . How 'd it go with the bishop ? Not great . Who knew that getting a divorce from God would be this difficult . It 's not ... Did you talk to John ? It didn 't go so great . John , my God . Chelsea , I 've been having an affair . Last night , we were gonna have sex in a pool when I slipped and cracked my head . You were gonna have sex in a pool ? Yeah , but I promised God that if he let me live , I would be a better husband to you . Yeah , it turns out ... this whole lifelong vow thing is gonna be a lot harder to get out of than we thought . I really want to hug you right now . But ... May I buy you a whiskey ? I think she 's ready . I 'm always ready . Wait , ready for what ? All right . We 'd like to call up our next karaoke artist ... Alex Foster . Yeah ! Whoo ! Whoo ! What are you talking about ? I did not sign up . Yeah , well , you 're not the only one who can write " Alex Foster " on a piece of paper . So sing . Sing , sing , sing ! Sing , sing , sing , sing ! Come on , you can do it ! Okay , okay , I 'll do one song . Yay ! Here goes nothing . That 's my drink , actually . We 're here . Yeah ! Whoo ! Which song ? Wouldn 't you like to know ? I 'm doing it a cappella . Wow . Ozzie . Hey , listen , man , so look , we got this for you for your trip . Um , it 's got a box of chocolates in there , an extra phone charger ... You know , practical stuff . And I wanted to get you a knife , but I don 't know , I thought that would be kind of weird . - Yeah . - Yeah , so instead ... I got you a gun . No , that 's okay . You hold onto the gun . No , you hold onto that . I 'll just keep the chocolates and the charger . Thanks . Yeah . I guess this is it . Hey , guys , hurry up . She 's on the third verse . This reminds me of the time we broke Timothy Leary out of jail . Timothy Leary ? Go . Hurry . Okay , all right , Han . There goes the bravest man I 've ever known . This is the weirdest date ever . Okay . All right there , everybody , that was amazing . - So strong . Yeah . - So emotional . Hello . Are you okay ? That song seemed ... very personal . Yes . Well , Annie was an orphan , and ... I 'm an orphan . So I really identify with her . Okay , that 's connecting some dots . I was found in a bassinet in a baby nursery store . My parents just left me there . Like Punky Brewster . No , she was found in a mall . Get your orphan stories right . And I know all of them . Batman , Anne of Green Gables , Alexander Hamilton . Where 's Ozzie ? Yeah , he went to the bathroom . Ozzie ! - He was here . He 's not here . - That 's so funny . He 's gone , isn 't he ? - Ozzie 's not here . - I just saw him . - I am so surprised . - Alex ! Come on ! Shit ! Who was that woman in the hospital ? Is your name even Don ? You 're married , aren 't you ? No , no , no . I 'm not married . And my name is Don . We actually know each other from somewhere else . I tried to tell you the truth when we were in Iceland . I 'm ... I 'm your alien . I visited you . Who told you about my experience ? No one told me anything . I 'm ... I 'm ... I was your experience . You are a unique and valuable creation , Kelly . My God . My God . My God , it 's ... - You 're an alien ? - Yes . I just ... - My God ! - No , no . - No ! - It 's a negative ? No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! I 'm so sorry I have to do this , but I 'm going to erase your mind . What ? ! Okay , let 's try this again . Try what again ? Remember the first time we met , at the coffee shop ? That was not the first time we met . - What do you mean ? - Well ... Now ... Picture me ... with a beer in your kitchen . It 's a pleasant memory . You 're an awesome listener . There we go . My God ! - No . - What are you ... Okay , so , hey , look at this . - No , no , no , please . - You should know the truth . You deserve the truth . What the is going on ? ! Okay , Kelly , you ... You want the truth ? Yeah , that would be great . I 'm married . Well , I knew it . Why do I keep falling for this bullsh ... I thought you were different . No , I 'm bad . I 'm so sorry . You deserve someone better than me . You 're Goddamn right I do . In fact , I wish ... that we 'd never even met . You have a nice life , Don . You , too . You know , the ... The last thing I remember , I was ... I was gonna clean up Walsh 's mess , so I beamed down to Earth , and I walked out onto the road , and I ... - Car ! - Shh , shh ! You 're safe now . There 's no cars up here . The important thing is that you 're alive . Yeah . - Yeah . - Yeah , but how ? And why were you so close to my face when I woke up ? I was ... clearly doing CPR . You know , I don 't know . Um ... Is it hot in here ? It feels very hot ... - in here . Hey . - What ? There 's new management on the ship . What ? New management ? Yeah . There was a merger . Our new boss is a Cube . He 's changing everything . He wanted me to get rid of your body . What a dick . Total dick . I knew Jeff couldn 't be trusted . Is Don still an asshole ? Yeah , you weren 't dead that long . Congrats . You proud of yourselves for embarrassing an FBI agent ? Were you all in on this ? Is it even your birthday ? Well , it 's tomorrow , but the Groupon for this place expired tonight . This could cost me my job . There . I got you a body scrub . Alex . Alex , wait , please . What we did was awful . I just hope that one day you 'll understand why we did it . We are really sorry . And if you ever , ever want to talk about being an orphan ... I 'm here , I 'm available . And I 'm trained . I don 't need to talk to anyone ... and neither did Batman . Wow , that 's good . When you 're from space , and you 're ... you 're in love with someone on Earth ... it 's ... it 's such a bu ... Pbht ! It 's a downer . This chair is just the worst . You , space ! You heard me . My name is Don . And , um , I 'm an alcoholic . - Hey , Don . - Hi , Don . I guess it all started when I met a girl named Kelly . Ozzie won 't get here till morning . I 'll take the first watch . Why , because you 're a man ? No , I ... I just thought you might want to ... Get some sleep . Big day tomorrow . Okay . Thanks .

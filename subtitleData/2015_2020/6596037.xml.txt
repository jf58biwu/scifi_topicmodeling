 THE FIFTH WAVE Translation . Review by Angel . Help me ? THE FIFTH WAVE Is somebody there ? I am hurt . Is somebody there ? Please ? I am bleeding . Help me ? Drop your weapon . You drop yours first . Drop it ! Okay . Your turn . Let me see your other hand . If I move this hand , I am afraid my stomach will fall out . I need to see your other hand . - What is in your hand ? - Nothing . Drop your weapon . What is in your hand ? I miss the Cassie I was . Hey . A totally normal high school girl . - Hey ! How are you doing ? - Hi ! Good . - Cheers . - Thank you . Cheers . I wonder what that Cassie would think of me now . The Cassie who kills . You know , he was supposed to be here . Who ? Why are the hot ones always so unreliable ? What would I even say to him ? I do not know him , and he does not even know me . You are a girl . He is a boy . - Your parts go together . - Do not . God ! - Okay , Liz . - What ? I am going to see you Monday . I have to go home . Skedaddle . Okay . - I love you . - I love you . - Bye ! - Text me when you are home . Okay . Hey ? Hey ! Nice phone case . What ? Do you have something against pink ? No ! No . I totally like it . I am just kidding . This is actually my sister 's phone . I dropped her off at a sleepover , and she took mine by mistake . Mine is much cooler . It is the Spider-Man . Polka dots . That is she . Hey . Yeah , yeah , I have it . No ! No I have not looked at your text messages . Nice phone case ! Right . I am the Captain Lochner , this is Sergeant Nicolai . - Hello . - How do you do ? I am sorry . No more coffee . Miss Gray , do you know this gentleman ? Sing me a song . A song ? Okay , close your eyes . Bones sinking like stones . All we fought it . I did not know it then , but that was the last normal day of my life . All of us are done . When you are in high school , just about everything feels like the end of the world . Can you believe what happened ? No . An early curfew , a final exam ... - Hey , Ben ! - Stop it . Soccer practice . Sullivan . What are we doing out here ? Why not just tell her where you are going to kick it ? Come on , let us go . Hey , check it out . Look at this . It is so freaky . - Watch ! - I cannot see anything . My God ! Altschuler . That is it . You are done . Off the field . No ! However , look ! It is weird . Off ! Goodbye . Adios . - What is going on ? - Let us go ! Hustle up ! Give me your phone . Give me your phone . Mine does not work ! - It very just stopped . - All right , Perkins . Turns out , what we thought was the end of the world . Was not . What ? Did someone famous die or something ? It appears to be metallic and , of a considerable size . Across the world , social media has been awash with panic and speculation , as these images spread like wildfire . The president has authorized NASA to attempt communication with the object . That is now circling our planet . And , is currently over the United States , moving west over Ohio . My God ! It is right over us . I want to see ! - Hey ! - No ! Sammy waits . Sammy waits ! - You can see it ! - Come here ! Look up there , honey . - What is that ? - I have no idea . There were no messages from our galactic party crashers during the first 10 days . But , pretty soon , they had a name . We called them : " The Others . " Are the Wilsons leaving , too ? They say they do not feel safe so close to the city . Okay . Is this everyone ? Guess , who is sitting right behind me . Well , okay . Everybody look at the equation on the board . I will tell him you are available for sex in the end of world . Who can give me the derivative of X ? Anybody ? Anyone ? What ... ? I am sure this is just a power outage . My phone is not working . What is going on ? Over here ! What is on Earth ? My goodness ! What is going on ? Look at up ! Back up ! Back up ! " The Others " hit us with an electromagnetic pulse that killed all the power on the planet . No more engines . No more electricity . No more running water . No more everything , we took for granted . That was the last time I saw Ben Parish . I guess , he is dead now . Like everyone else in that room . Here , Sam . Grab me another one , okay ! Thank you ! That was the first Wave . At the time , we thought that was it . Then , the second Wave hit us . Come on ! Sammy . It is an earthquake ! Cassie ! Watch out ! Cassie ! Go on ! Go ! Go ! Wait ! Cassie ! It is okay . It is okay . Just keep your head down , okay ! What is that noise ? Sammy , run ! - Go ! - Cassie ! Go on ! Cassie ! Go . - Cassie ! Hurry up ! - I am fine ! - Go , Sammy ! Go ! - Cassie ! Come here . Hold on to me . Cassie ! In Ohio , we only had the lake to worry about . But , by the ocean , I can only imagine . Every coastal city , every island , It was gone . There are over 300 billion birds in the world . That is 75 birds for every person . Mom said the avian flu was already one of the world 's deadliest viruses . In the third Wave , " The Others " modified it . They made it unstoppable . And , the birds spread across of the planet . Line A. Line A is for those who have already been assessed . If you are waiting to be assessed , then proceed to Line B. No pedal pulse , no brachial , nothing . Sit down , sir . Thank you ! Just head straight on back . I am not happy over here . I feel fine ! I should be on the area that is not quarantined ! Hey , Liz ! - Hey . - Your mom said you were here . - Cassie ! Cassie ! - Mom ? What are you ... ? She is in quarantined . - It is okay . I did not even touch her . - It is not okay . You cannot be here . I am sorry . Sweetheart , I need you to go home and look after Sammy , okay ! However , Mom , I want to help you here . Can you get her out of here now ? - Mom ! - It is okay . Just go . Miss , you have to leave . Let us go . - Quarantine six . - In six . Some people were immune to the virus . And , a few people got sick and , somehow recovered . But , most people did not . MOMMY Hey . You cannot wear those shoes . Why do not they just get over with it ? What do they want ? I think a better question is : " What do they need ? " They have been very careful so far . Not to damage it any more than absolutely necessary . What is damage ? The Earth ! I think that is why they are here , Cassie . They need the Earth . However , not us . No ! Not us . Do you ready to walk for a while , Sammy ? Yeah . Okay . Dad , how far is it to the refugee camp ? Just a few miles . We should be there by nightfall . - Dad , look ! Is this it ? - Yeah , buddy . I think so . Hey ! Welcome ! Thanks . Hi . The name is Hutch field . Hi ! See you . Let me show you around the place . The latrines are there off to the left . The farm is out that way . Did you get the fresh water ? Yeah ! Not too bad ! How many people are there in here ? I do not know how many we are now . Three hundred and five , something like that . Dining hall is over here . When is the last time you had a hot meal ? Good ! Maybe you can walk me through it . Here , we draw a purple hat . Can we get some water over here ? - Dad . - This is a Colt 45 . Okay ! This button changes out the clip . That is loaded . All right ? Safety on . Safety off . Listen to me . You are going to carry this with you at all times . You are not going to tell anybody you have it . And you are only going to use it if it is life or death . Do you get it ? I thought we were safe here . Pumpkin , there is nothing safe anymore . Here , you want to put it in the basket . Okay . - Here . Take this one . - Okay . You got to get the weeds . What is that ? Sammy , come here . - What is that ? - I do not know . Come on ! Asher , come on ! Mommy ? Dad ? CAMP CUYAHOGA - WELCOME . What is that ? - Do you see Dad ? - Dad ? - Cassie ? - Hey , Dad . Hey . - What is going on ? - Guys take it easy . I thought the cars did not work . SCHOOL BUS I am Colonel Vosch of the US Army . My men and I are from the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base . We are here to help . It is in time . We let us get people out of here . - Heck , yeah ! - Thank you . Yes ! USA ! We should be ready to go at a moment is notice . All right ! You stay with your sister , Sammy . - Come on ! - You can go right on the bus . Adults , please move to the mess hall for a briefing . Children , please move to the buses for transport . We are right behind you . Be good ! Adults , please move to the mess hall for a briefing . Do you think they have electricity ? If the trucks are working . I do not know . Why , do you still have a phone ? Yeah . - You have a charger . - Of course , yeah . - Sir , sir . - Yeah ? My orders are to get just the kids onto the bus . Well , those might be your orders , but they are my kids . - Yeah . - We are going to stay together . - We will wait for another bus . - It is all right , Private . I get this . - Yes , sir . - Thank you . Look ! You are welcome to keep them here with you if want . But , if they were my kids , I would get them in that bus . Why ? We have reason to believe there is an imminent threat to this location . We are trying to get everyone to safety as quickly as we can , and this is the only working transport we have got . We are taking shifts based on need . Kids first , then we come back for the rest of you . Well ! How safe is it at Wright-Patterson ? Safest place there is right now . In addition , the buses will just come right back ? Dad ? No ! We drop them off , come right back . As if I said , it is your call . Just because some man in uniform tries to tell us what to do ... does not mean , we actually have to follow his orders . Okay ! I want you on this one . All right ? - I will be right behind you . - We cannot split up . Moreover , we are going to have dinner tonight . We are going to the same place . - Dad ! No ! - Cassie . It is the Army , okay .

All right ? - I will be right back . - Do you promise ? Yeah ! I will be right back . I promise you . Right , no , I think you are right . Just grab whatever you can get up in a box and carry it . This way . Down to the mess hall . In the mess hall now , please . Come on ! Sammy . Bear . Bear . Bear . Bear . Bear . Bear . Bear . God ! Sammy ? Hey ! Wait ! Stop ! Sammy ! Cassie ! Wait please ! Stop ! Sammy ! No ! Sammy Waits ! Sammy ! Cassie ! Come on . Cassie ! Sammy ! No ! Cassie , no ! No ! No ! No ! Shit ! Can I have your attention , please ? If you will all just quiet down . We believe the fourth Wave has begun . " The Others " came down off their ship . They are moving among us . Apparently , they have the ability to inhabit human hosts , and control their actions . - They look like humans . - That is correct . Where are they ? They could be anywhere . What we do know is : They have snipers in these woods , and they are targeting survivors . We have Intel that suggest ... Some of them could be right here in this camp . What ? Are you saying that some of us are " The Others " ? Please ! There is a lot , we still do not know . We can detect them in children . Unfortunately , the screening procedure for adults is a bit more complicated . What about our kids ? Yeah ! What about our kids ? I know . I know you all want to get back to your families . Unfortunately , we are going to have to move you all to a secure holding facility . So , they can run some screening protocols . Folks , please ? You need to understand , there is no way to differentiate us from " The Others " . Without a comprehensive screening process . The sooner we can get you screened . The sooner you can get back to your families . This is bullshit ! I am not a " The Others " , okay . I am not going anywhere . Sir , no one is saying that you are " The Others " . This is the reality of our situation . Now , you just calm down . Please , just calm down . Let me out of here . Get out of my way . Watch out ! - Hold on , sir . - Wait . - Back up , now . - Stop right there . - Sir , drops your weapon . - Step aside , now . - Sir , drops your weapon . - Drew , no ! You cannot keep me in here ! - Everybody , just calm down ! - Let me out now ! Lower the weapon , now . - I want to see my kids ! - Put it down ! Let me out of here ! No ! Drew , stop ! Stay down ! Run ! No ! No ! No ! Hey , Dad ? Daddy ? I am sorry ! I am sorry ! Daddy ? I need my Dad . God ! Security teams , clear zones three and four . Support team members , meet arrivals on the tarmac . Stand in the red circle . Wait for your number to be called . Stand in the red circle . Wait for your number to be called . Number one-two-seven . Stand in the red circle . Wait for your number to be called . Stand in the red circle . Wait for your number to be called . Two-nine-five . Two-nine-five . Two-nine-five . Here . Number seven-three . Seven-three . Number seven-four . Number one-three-zero . One-nine-four . One-three-zero . One-nine-four . What is your name ? Ben Parish . They called me " Zombie " in quarantine . Any family not know that you be dead ? No . My sister died in the quakes . Mom and Dad killed by the Virus . However , it did not kill you , did it ? Not quite . Where from did the Nickname comes ? You fought it off . Yeah , lucky me . Is this your sister 's ? Yeah . Well , lucky you . You get to help avenge her death . This puts out a signal that we can track . You kids are the most important thing right now . We need every one of you to help us fight " The Others " . This is not summer camp , Zombie ! You are a soldier now . Therefore , we do not want to lose you . Stand up . Turn around . Take a deep breath . Are you all right ? How are we supposed to fight " The Others ? " If we do not even know , what are they ? Actually , we do . Do you want to see one ? Do not worry . He will not be able to see us . I know . It is impossible to tell . Look through here . Look ! It is its true form . " The Others " infest real humans like some sort of parasite . Take over their minds , their bodies . Drugs , radiation , surgery , nothing works . The only way to kill them is to kill the host . He is already dead . You just need to destroy the thing inside him . The thing that did this . Push the button . Look again ! Look ! If you are going to be on my squad . I need to know that you will do to whatever it takes . Welcome to the fight . Here is how you kill off a species . First , you take out the easy ones , the weak , the exposed . Kill them as efficiently as possible . It was the first of three Waves . But , even if you bomb a bug of the house , there is always a few cockroaches left . Now , we are like those cockroaches . And " The Others " are picking us . One by one . And because " The Others " look like us . We cannot trust anyone . Eighty miles to Wright-Patterson . I am coming , Sammy . I promise you . How do you rid the world of humans ? Help me ! First , you rid the humans of their humanity . WRIGHT-PATTERSON AF9 - 46 ML . Shit ! Shit ! Shit ! God ! Sammy . All right ! All right ! God ! I am sorry , Sammy . When I was a child , I spoke as a child . I thought and I reasoned as a child . When I became a man . I put away the things childish . Those words never meant more to me than they do right now , looking at all of you . Our hope , our future . The best and brightest vision of who we are and what for we are fighting . Our intelligence tells us " The Others " is readying themselves for a final attack . The fifth Wave . What form it will take , we do not know . If they are successful . There will be no more Wave . No more conflicts . Humanity as we know , it will be wiped from the face of the Earth . Now . I am going to tell you some things I know . This is our world . It is our home . They will not overrun it . They will not possess it . So , with whatever the time that we have left . You will learn to think , speak , and move , fight like the soldiers you are . Look out ! A raid ! Go ! Fire ! Let the weight of our loss to be fuel for you . Let the weight of our dead embolden you . On your right ! On your right ! Let the weight of our hope drive you to victory . Can you do that ? All right ! Hold on ! Soldiers , can you do that ? Sir , yes , sir ! Zombie ! - Get down ! Do not move ! - It is a booby trap ! Can you do that ? Sir , yes , sir ! Good ! Come on ! Where is my gun ? Where is my gun ? Where is it ? I know , you are awake . Cassie ? How the hell , do you know my name ? Your driver 's license . I am Evan . Evan Walker . Where am I ? You were bleeding on the highway . I brought you back here to my house . Where is my gun ? All right ! When you found me on the highway , I had my gun . Where is it ? I did not see any gun . What did you do ? Your leg , Cassie . - Do not touch me ! Do not touch me ! - Your leg . Jesus ! God ! Put your leg . - This is going to hurt . - Just do it . Just do it . God ! Okay . God ! How long have I been here ? About a week . God ! How far is Wright-Patterson from here ? The military base ? About sixty miles . Why ? Jesus ! Hey . It is okay . - You are safe here . - No . I am not safe anywhere anymore . Why did you want to know how close Wright-Patterson was ? It is my brother . The Army took him to there , so I ... I need to get him back . What ? You should eat . You got to get your strength back . Why would you bring me here ? What do you want ? My family . I could not save them . However , I could save you . The way everything has happened , I guess it just makes me feel more ... Human . In addition , you need help with that . Feeling human . Do not you ? Maybe . - You are cheating . - I am not cheating . Do not you tell him my card ? Do you hear me Oompa ? I have been getting lucky , and , this is not my first time playing . By the way , I heard the new person coming in got kicked out of their last squad . - For what ? - Disciplinary issues . Is that true boss ? That is what they say . What is his name ? The name is Ringer . In addition , he is a she . Bunk is over there . Did you ever do karate before ? No . Sure looks like you did . Are you Zombie ? Yeah . I was the leader of my last squad . No doubt . So , the person I replace went Section eight . Why ? Does it matter ? I heard it is because this squad is so bad . He was afraid you had get him killed when the fifth Wave hits . It is your squad , too , now . Hey ! Keep staring at my ass , and I will rip your throats out . Let us be clear . I am not taking orders from you . I am not going to die with you geniuses . Good to know . If anyone in this barrack touches me , I will kill them . You got it . Anything else ? I like to play chess . Do you play ? No , actually . But , if you want to play some strip poker later on ... Shit ! And no demeaning , sexist remarks . She is cool . Quiet ! You had my gun the whole time ! Why did you lie ? I was afraid you would shoot me . All I knew , you were a " The Others " . Yeah , well ... Was he one ? Out there ! Yeah . The woods are full of them . They are using those drones to hunt down survivors . He looked so human . God ! I have to get Sam . Cassie . Rallying points , places like Wright-Patterson . They are obvious targets . Do you think that Sammy is already dead ? I am sorry , Cassie . You are wrong , Evan . All right ! He is alive . He is alive , and I am going to go get him . Cassie ? I am going with you . You are not going to make it very far on your own . Do you know what ? Screw you , Evan . - I do not need you . I do not need anyone . - Cassie ! Come on ! - If you go , I will just follow you . - Actually , no . If I need someone to carve a cane for me . You cannot stop me . How are you going to stop me ? I do not know . Maybe I will shoot you ! Like you shot that person with the crucifix ! Do you read my journal ? - I did not think you were going to live . - Do not touch me ! I am sorry . I will get you there . I cannot promise that you will find , but I will get you there . We leave in the morning . This is a waste of time . Go ahead and try it again . Those kids are going to be dead before their boots hit the ground . Especially with you as squad leader . You do not know anything about me . Let me guess . You did well in school , had a bunch of friends . You probably played football . You might have even been team captain . Life was easy . And then , all of a sudden , it was not . No more games to win . No one to get weak-kneed for this pretty smile . You were not ready for the end of world . In addition , were you ? I know how to survive . In addition , I was doing fine out there on my own . Until they forced me onto their stupid school bus . They were rescuing us . We were not rescued , dumb-ass . We were drafted . Good ! Good ! Try it again . How about this ? I take you down . You teach us how to shoot . In addition , when you do not . I stop asking you . Deal . Cute necklace . Girlfriend or sister ? Sister . You are too sentimental . Can you teach me that thing ? Where you took the gun out of my hand . Let us just leave any potential disarming to me . No ! No ! I need to be ready . Cassie , it is okay . You do not have to be tough all the time . Do not do that . I am not tough , okay ! I promised Sammy that I would be there for him no matter what . I made that promise to him . Okay . Give me your gun . Get up . Point it at my chest . Okay ! Grab the barrel of the gun with your hand left , and with your hand right , snap my hand away . You got it . You are not going to hurt me . All right ! Like that , but stronger . Good ! Now at the end , you will grab my wrist and pull it toward you . - Like this ? - Yeah . Good job . Well , thanks . Can I have ... ? Okay ! Do not be so scared of your weapon . You got to think that the gun is a part of you . The gun is not firing , you are firing . Try it again . Well ! That was not terrible . Zombie , the Colonel wants to see you , now . It could be . It seems like a good target . I will be right back . - Lieutenant ? - Yes , sir . Simultaneous attacks on the last of our metropolitan areas . A full-on invasion . This is it . The fifth Wave . Was it started ? Yeah . Here , I want to show you something . These employ the same technology as the detector viewer the medical . We have improved it . We made it mobile . The idea is to allow our soldiers in the field ... Instantly , differentiate between friend and foe . You look at the enemy through this , and it lights them up green . We can see them before them know they have been seen . We take back the advantage . The only thing left to do now is test the optics in live conditions . This is why tomorrow at 2100 , I am sending four squads into battle equipped with these helmets . Your squad will be among those four . Yes , sir . Make me proud , son . Bring that squad back in one piece . Yes , sir . Evan ? - Good morning ! - Good morning ! Whom do we have here ? This is Lizbeth . She is my best friend . She looks like she is funny . Yeah . Actually , you know , she was ... She was funny . - And this person . - He is nobody . This must be Ben Parish . God ! I really wish you had not read my journal . It is embarrassing . Is that your family ? Yeah . In addition , that must be Sam . Yeah . I cannot wait to meet him . - We should probably get moving . - Yeah . All right ! This way . How do you know without a compass ? Do you have a compass ? No . However ... You know , I can make one out of a pin and a glass of water . Would not peg you that is a Girl Scout . What would you peg me ? A cheerleader ? You said it , not me . I have never been a huge fan of the outdoors . Too many bugs . You live on a farm . Accident of birth . I had a scholarship to Kent State . Mechanical engineering . You thought I was some hick . You said it , not me . Zombie ! Are they really sending us to fight ? Yeah . I am scared . It is okay . Just go to sleep . All right ! What was your name before ? Ben . What was yours ? Sam . However , my sister called me Sammy . When I could not sleep . She would sing to me . " Bones sinking like stones . " " All that we fought . " " Homes , places that we have grown . " " All of us are done . " Could you people , please , shut up ? " We live in a beautiful world . " " Yeah , we do , yeah , we do . " " We live in a beautiful world . " Hey . Let me help you . Yeah , sure . - Looks better . - Yeah . - Let me do this . - All right . - Do you get scissors ? - Yeah . I got it . - I should probably cover our stuff . - Evan . Thank you . - Squad fifty-three ? - Present and accounted . All right ! Strap in . Takeoff . Where is Nugget ? Food poisoning . Zombie ? Zombie ? Let me out of here ! Copy that . Tango 3 dropping down 1,000 . Did you clear of your orders ? Infiltrate enemy hornet 's nest , verify enemy and terminate . Remember , " The Others " light up green in your visors . At mission was complete , signal us for extraction . We will take you to home . Holy shit ! It is working . You people , I got two of them straight ahead . In addition , I heard this . I got you . You motherfuck ! I peed . I definitely peed . Get inside ! Return fire ! Coming this way ! - They are over here , too ! - Run for the alley ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! - Teacup goes ! Go ! - Go ! Run ! Move ! Go ! Go ! Contact ! Stay low ! Get to the bus . Go ! Where is Teacup ? - Where is Teacup ? We lost Teacup . - I am here ! You do not do that ! Do not scare me like that ! Oompa has been shot ! Down ! Down ! Now , now ! Down ! Down ! Down ! Oompa has been shot ! Down ! He is not breathing ! Do not die . Come on ! Man ! Do not die . Please do not die . Oompa ! Stay alive , Oompa ! We cannot stay here . They will be back . That alleyway . We will have cover there . No ! It is too far . If we are out in the open that long , they will pick us , one by one . We need a distraction . - Okay . - Okay ! What ? I will distract them . When I tell you to run . Run as fast as you can . - Cover me , now ! - What ? Listen up ! On my go , haul ass to the alleyway . Back out there ! Are you crazy ? Listen , Teacup , you just got to trust me . Okay ! You are going to run and do not look back . - What about Oompa ? - He is dead , man . We have to leave him . Sorry , man ! I am sorry . - Zombie , now ! Run ! - Haul ass ! - Go ! Go ! Go ! - Let us move ! Move ! Move ! - Stairs . - I get it . Clear ! Clear ! Clear ! Are we still alive ? I think so . Watch out ! Do not shoot ! It is Ringer ! That was badass , Ringer . I would hug you , if I did not think you will punch me in the nuts for this . Okay ! So , what do we do now ? None of this makes sense . They knock down planes out of the sky , and cause earthquakes . However , are they afraid of an army of children ? There is something Vouch is not telling us . Okay ! I am not risking my life for this . Ringer , what are you doing ? I am not enlisting . I am better out there on my own . You know what is best for you . You will do the same . - Holy shit ! What is this ? - Zombie , you see this . - She is green ! - What have you people ? Put your guns down . You are one of them ! You are an alien ! What about are you talking ? I just saved your asses ! If she is one of them , we have to take her out now . Pound cake , just calm down . All right ! - We have ... - I can see it ! I can see it inside of her ! - There is nothing inside me ! - Shut up ! - Zombie , what do we do ? Do we shoot her ? - It is your call , Zombie . Zombie , what are you doing ? What is up , man ? - My God ! What is going on , man ? - Come on ! Hey ! Put your guns down . Put your guns down . Do not shoot . Calm down . She is not a " The Others " . Neither I am . - I am glowing green , right . - Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , listen . You know me . Come on , Dumbo . You know who I am . Put the guns down . Just put them down ! I am not a " The Others " . I do not think even any of those people out there shooting at us are " The Others " . Reznik , Vosch ... They lied to us . They laid to us , man . Green does not mean alien . Green means human . Just , without one of these . What about are you talking ? Do not people see ? Those lenses , these trackers , it is all fake , man . It is an illusion . It is a trick . They were not testing these . They were testing us . They were seeing how we would do , how we would hold under pressure . All right ! If we would do what we were trained to do . - To kill " The Others " ! - No , to kill the survivors , man ! To kill survivors . Yeah , well , what about the people outside , the ones that were shooting at us ? They are human . Why would the Army want us to kill other humans ? Because the Army , Reznik , Vosch ... They are " The Others " . In addition , because we are kids . They thought could manipulate us to do their dirty work . We are not fighting the fifth Wave . We are the fifth Wave . God ! So ... What do we do ? Take out your trackers . We go away off . This means we cannot go back . You know that , right ! Nugget . I left him back at the base . - I was trying to protect him . - Jesus ! - I have to go back . - That is suicide , dude . - No , man ! I have to go back . - You cannot wander back in there . - They will know . - I cannot leave him there ! I will put in back the tracker . They will pick up me . You go ahead . I will meet with you later . Dumbo , where can I take a bullet in the torso and not die ? - Are you serious ? - I am not kidding , man . Where can I take a bullet in the torso ? I have to make it look real . It is the only way , I am getting back alive . It is impossible , man . There are too many organs . There is to be in somewhere , man ! Ringer ! She can shoot in me . All right ! I know she can . Do you want me to shoot in you ? Do not pretend like you have not thought about this . Where do you want me to shoot him ? I mean , the ... Shit ! Evan Walker ? You are out of your drone sector . Hey ! Put the gun down . Stay away . Cassie , run ! Where is my gun ? Evan ? Drop the gun . Evan , drop it . If I was going to kill you , Cassie , I would have done it a long time ago . Who are you ? You are one of them . You are a fucking " The Others " . I am human . However , I am " The Others " , too . I am both . This is not the first time " The Others " have been here . They came before and created sleeper agents , like me . I always felt different . Growing up , there was this voice in my head .

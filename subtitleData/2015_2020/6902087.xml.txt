 I just can 't believe this is the last time I 'll walk into this building and say , " Good Morning , Misty . " " Good morning , Misty . " You 've got a thing . In your ... Where ? Oh , God . [ Misty ] Weirdo . [ Lloyd ] Paraguay . HBW000337890 . Yep . Gotcha . [ Mort ] Well ! If it isn 't another misty morning ! Misty freaking morning . How goes it , Misty-kins ? It 's the same as it always goes , Mort . Doofus . [ Rico ] Okay . Uh , Finland . HBW00837 2717 . [ Misty ] Finland . Yeah . Finland . I 've always loved the way you say " Finland . " It 's like , " Fin . Land . " Thanks . You know what 's funny . Godfrey 's closing after all these years , and you and me never got the chance to , you know . To ? I thought you knew . I 'm married . Your wife doesn 't need to know ! There 's a broom closet on the second floor . It 's very roomy . Is this woman harassing you again , Rico ? I 'm fine , Lloyd . Let 's just get out of here . [ Jason ] Told ya . Eat shit , Jason . Jackass . ( upbeat jazz music ) ( bell ringing ) It is time to begin working . ( upbeat jazz music ) ( bell ringing ) It is time to stop working . [ Misty ] Esther said to wait here . She said , Mr. Godfrey wants to speak with us personally . Oh ! He wants to say goodbye ! [ Jason ] Oh , I 'm thinking fat severance bonuses . Bonuses should be based on tenure . Bonuses should be based on talent . Loyalty is more important . Innovation is more important . Ass-kissing 's pretty high up there , too . And as master of the butt smooch , Jason . I do not kiss ass , okay ? I strategize self-actionization moments . It 's all in Steve 's seminars . Your " shaman " is named " Steve " ? Mr. Godfrey ! Jason Tumley , warehousing associate . I just want to say , what an honor and a privilege it has been toiling in your shadow . Which , actually , hasn 't even really been like a shadow . It 's more like a white hot sun illuminating the ... Ow ! Thank you very much , Jason , for that speech . It contained words , verbs , nouns , and so forth . So huzzah to you , lad ! And now on to business . I know you 're all waiting for some envelopes . Yes ? You all love envelopes . Right ? [ Mort ] It 's really not the envelopes . It 's the stuff inside . That 's exactly the robust spirit that 's kept Godfrey Global Inventory alive and kicking all these years . Until tonight when it finally , finally dies . So , anyway , Esther , envelopes . ( bouncy music ) [ Mort ] It 's an invitation . To a party . Oh Jesus tits . In honor of your loyal years of service to Godfrey Global Inventory , Esther and I , request the pleasure of your company at a farewell soiree to be held here tonight . We 've never been to a party before . We 've never been to a party before . You 've never been to a party before ? No , we 've never been to a party before . And because we 've never been to a party before this will be the finest party we 've ever thrown ! [ Janet ] Oh , come on , guys ! Come on , let 's embrace this . I mean , this is our last day . Our last day ! I mean , we 've all worked here for ? 11 years . Seven years . 14 years . Talent matters more than tenure . All these years , and what have we ever really learned about each other ? Or about Mr. Godfrey ? Or his lovely twin sister , Esther ? Or about Godfrey Global Inventory itself ? Its purpose , its function . I mean , the raison d 'etre for the thousands of punchcards . And so on and so forth , Janet , thank you . So . Party tonight ? Where 's our checks ? Final checks will be distributed at the party . Can you just , like , mail mine ? Well , we could , " just , like , mail " yours if you decline tonight 's invitation . However , party attendance is mandatory in order to receive Godfrey Global 's additional severance bonus , which is quite generous . Quite generous . [ Jason ] So , if we don 't go to the party , then we don 't get our bonuses ? Whip smart , that one . After 11 years of " manning the carts " here at Godfrey , I would be honored to hoist a couple of tall cold ones . You wanna talk honored ? I mean , my bowels clench with pride when this man , when this , when this , when this fella right here inspired me in my brief ... So ! 7 : 06 sharp . [ Janet ] I 'm only gonna be gone a few hours , Nana , you 'll be fine by yourself . [ Nana ] I 'm actually glad you 're going out . Really ? [ Nana ] That way you won 't have to hear my screams . There will be no screaming tonight . You 're right . They 'll probably ball gag me right from the get-go . Nana , no one 's going to ball gag you , okay ? Not if they slit my throat first . Then they can steal my silver tea service in peace and quiet while I bleed out . You know , it 's a shame you 've never met Mr. Godfrey ! You 're the same age ! Though he sure doesn 't look 80 , it 's the weirdest thing . [ Nana ] All those murderers have baby faces . He 's my age ? Janet ? Can I come to the party ? Showering , I can 't hear you ! [ Nana ] JANET ! Yes , I know . I 've watched it . I 'm watching it right now . [ Shaman Steve ] Actionization is about establishing your masculine potential as a shamanic warrior . Squat low . Breathe hot . YAAAAHR Steve , I do . I do breathe the warrior fire , okay . I breathe it actionizingly , but even the warrior fire , it can 't stop my employer from closing up shop . You 're right . You 're right , you 're right , but maybe now that Godfrey 's is gone maybe the universe is telling me to take it to the next level , you know ? Go full shaman and start teaching other warriors to breathe the warrior fire , and ... What ? Right now ? Okay , okay . Just hold on . YAAAAAAHR ! Is it " yahr " or is it " aar ? " 'Cause I can never ... Oh , shit ! [ Male radio announcer ] Whether you seek ultimate relaxation , or ultimate excitement . [ Female radio announcer ] The Ambergris Islands await you .

[ Disclaimer radio announcer ] All-inclusive resort packages start at just $ 1,500 . [ Female Radio Announcer ] The Ambergris Islands await you . What are you waiting for ? [ Mort ] They say that the squeaky wheel gets the grease . Well , I may not have been the squeakiest wheel during my 11 years tenure here at Godfrey Global Inventory . But then I 'm the kind of guy who will bend over backwards for my employer , whether or not he greases me up . I 'll take on any size workload , and I 've taken some pretty darn big ones during my 11 years tenure here at Godfrey Global Inventory . So . Thank you , Mr. Godfrey , for being my employer all these 11 years of my tenure here at Godfrey Global Inventory . How was that , Donald ? Did Daddy make a good speech ? Yes . Good boy . Yes . Yes , I know . ( dance music ) Hey . So glad you could make it this evening , Janet . Oh , thank you , Mr. Godfrey , I wouldn 't miss it for the world . Are you enjoying the gum ? Yes , it 's wonderful . Thank you . Here . Have another . No , thanks . I 'm okay . I insist ! Okay . No , no , I. Chew to your heart 's content ! Tonight is a special night ! You are so right , Mr. Godfrey . Tonight is special . But then again , every moment of my employment here at Godfrey Global has been special . They say that the squeaky wheel gets the grease . Well , I may not have been the squeakiest wheel during my 11 ... Hmmm . Party games ! [ Godfrey ] Excellent . Thank you , Esther , for keeping us on schedule . This portion of the evening has been allotted to party games . Tonight 's party game shall be " Duck Duck Goose . " You 're not serious . But this is a party . It is my understanding that seriousness would be inappropriate at this event . Touch√© , Mr. G ! Right ? When do we get our checks ? This is not the question-and-answer period of the evening . That 's at 5 : 13 a.m. You 're kidding , right ? No-one 's gonna be here at 5 a.m. [ Janet ] You know , I just think it 's wonderful that two people who have never been to a party before are bending over backwards to make sure we have a good time . So I say , bring on the " Duck Duck Goose ! " Duck , Duck , Duck . GOOSE ! Oh my god . GO . This is ridiculous . I have a heart condition , you know ! Duck . Duck . Duck . Goose . The hell with this ! Mort is not using his indoor voice . I 've used my indoor voice for far too long , Mr. Godfrey ! I 've bent over backwards , and you 've never greased me up to take on your big workload ! And , and , and now my 11-year tenure here at Godfrey Global Inventory has come to an end and I 'm ready to go home . So , you can hand me my pay check and I 'll mosey proudly along , because obviously , I 'm not appreciated here . I 'd prefer if you stayed until the party ended . [ Mort ] The party ended for me a long time ago , Mr. Godfrey . [ Misty ] Can I get my check too ? Very well , then . I 'll give you your check now . Thank you . But , that means that I 'll have to punch your card and move it to the " Dormant Accounts " file . Let 's see here . Janet , Jason , Misty , Mort . So , if I leave you 're going to ? [ Godfrey ] Process your card , and move it from " Active " to " Dormant " status . To make your termination official . Punch my card . Goodbye , everyone . [ Godfrey ] Gee , Mort . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I 'm fine ! [ Jason ] You okay there , big guy ? Did you take your heart medicine , Mort ? [ Misty ] You should sit down , Morty . [ Godfrey ] Nonsense , he 's fine , see ? Anyhow . AAAAAH ! [ Misty Mort ! Snap out of it ! [ Esther ] That is an unauthorized first aid procedure . I shall file an incident report . [ Janet ] Call 911 ! Mort ! Damn it ! Non-business related calls must be pre-approved by the management ! [ Misty ] Oh ! Oh my God ! Oh my God , oh my God , oh my God , oh my God ! Augh , Jason ! You took the CPR course ! C 'mere . Mr. Godfrey , we have to call 911 ! [ Jason ] Check his pulse ! Mr. Godfrey , please ! [ Godfrey ] He 's . Already . Dead . Janet . [ Misty ] Oh my god . He is dead . Oh , no . Oh , no . Oh my God ! Oh my God , it 's a million dollars ! It 's a million dollars ! Don 't stop ! [ Godfrey ] I hope Mort 's cat makes good use of its inheritance . Lucky , lucky Donald . Our severance bonus is a million dollars ? With one small caveat , I 'm afraid . Godfrey Global has one last batch of inventory that must be processed before the deadline . What deadline ? [ Godfrey ] The deadline . When we " shut ' er down . " The End . The deadline . So , when 's the deadline ? Dawn . Dawn is the deadline . So . So , you tricked us into coming here to work overnight ? No , no tricks . We invited you to a party . This is a party . Note the garlands . So , if we finish processing the inventory before dawn , we each get a million dollars ? Really ? [ Jason ] Awesome . Mr. Godfrey , it 's incredibly generous , but why would you give us such a large amount of money ? Well , you know what they say , Janet . You know what they say ! No . No . What do they say ? So , we 're all agreed then ? Hmmm ? You 'll work one more night for our humble operation ? [ Misty ] I will ! Yeah , yeah . I can . Yes . Yes . I guess so . But , what about Mort ? I 'll miss him so much . No , you won 't ! We 'll put him in your office to keep you company . Uh . And , remember , tonight is a celebration ! There will be mandatory party games during your breaks . Esther will officiate . I can 't believe I 'm gonna be rich . Good stuff never happens to me . Well , Godfrey 's got the dough to spread around . You know , they 've been raking it in for centuries , ever since he brought the company over from the Old Country . Which " Old Country ? " Beats me . What exactly is " the business " ? Global Inventory . Duh . Right . Holy crap . We 're gonna hafta haul ass if we wanna get that money . How did those get here ? Did I miss the delivery guy ? Jesus , get over it . ( quirky music ) Ta da ! He 's in a better place now . You really believe that ? NO . [ Jason ] I honestly don 't mind the extra workload . In fact , I relish the challenge to take on Mort 's duties as well as my own . I gotta say , I dig your style , Mr. Godfrey . I mean , clearly Mort 's passing was a coincidence , but you brilliantly parleyed that into increased worker productivity , and I just think I could learn a lot from you , sir . Do you know what else you could learn a lot from , Jason ? Television ! Television makes people shut up and stop thinking . Oh , gee . Sir , for me , thanks . That 's , um ... Television ! [ Male radio announcer ] Whether you seek ultimate relaxation , or ultimate excitement . [ Female radio announcer ] The Ambergris Islands await you . [ Male radio announcer ] A tropical paradise full of beautiful people . [ Misty ] I 'm a beautiful person . [ Female radio announcer ] The Ambergris Islands await you .

[ Female Radio Announcer ] The Ambergris Islands await you . [ Male Radio Announcer ] So what are you waiting for ? [ Woman Radio Announcer ] So what are you waiting for ? I don 't have to wait no more Gee , Janet , why don 't you have a seat ? Thank you , Misty . I knew I could talk to you . So , what do you think is happening here ? Uh , I 'm working one more night . For a million bucks . That 's what . But do you really believe Mr. Godfrey is going to give us each a million dollars ? [ Misty ] I saw Mort 's cheque . I counted the zeros . But Mort is ... Don 't be an idiot , Janet . But it ... Get out ! Okay , okay . I 'm sorry . [ TV Show host ] We 're down to the final two contestants here on " Yes , My Pet Can Dance ! " Partner ChiChi the spider monkey are raring to ... [ News Anchor ] We interrupt this program to bring you breaking news . A massive earthquake has hit Australia . The death toll is unknown , but seismologists say it may be a disaster of epic proportions . Australia ? [ News Anchor ] Measurements as high as 9.7 on the Richter scale rate this as the most devastating earthquake in recorded history . Sorry , I 've got a Update , here . This is amazing . Um , remarkably , there are no reports of mass fatalities as would be expected in seismic events of this magnitude . Only . Only one person has been reported dead . We await further details on this breaking story . And will continue to update you every hour on the hour . Mr. Godfrey ! Janet . Mr. Godfrey . Um , I 've been rethinking my decision . As generous as your offer is , I just can 't leave my Nana alone overnight . I feel wracked with guilt . Aw . Poor Janet . You miss your Nana ? Yeah . Seriously ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , absolutely . Tons . I just can 't wait to get back to her cheery little grimace and , um , well , also , Mort is dead in my office , and he 's developing an odor , which makes it very hard to work and ... Fascinating as always , Janet . But what I 'm really wondering is , would you rather I did this , or gave you a million dollars ? You 're not sure ? Hmm . I 'll take the money ! Good girl . Have some more gum . Chew , chew , chew ! [ News anchor ] The minuscule death toll amidst such epic scale destruction is nothing short of miraculous . Oh ! I 'm sorry , Mr. Godfrey . [ News anchor ] Says Australian Red Crest emergency management leader Barbara Borkner . [ Godfrey ] Jason , perhaps the television is too much of a distraction . No ! Sir , no . It 's just ... It 's the weirdest coincidence . I was , uh , I spilled some cards , and one of them just got damaged , and it happened to be from Australia , and now ... [ News anchor ] Australians are mourning Brisbane beekeeper Myron Bumbersnatch , the sole fatality in this devastating earthquake . See , that 's the thing . One fatality , one punchcard . [ News anchor ] Dedicated to his work , and to his bees . He is survived by his wife and two children from previous relationships . As tragic as the circumstances . He annoys me . This man who speaks . Who ? Peter Beckwith ? Oh , I can just ... Yeah , I 'll just change the channel . I can just turn it off . You know , you 're totally right . No . It 's important to remain apprised of current events . [ News anchor ] The utterly devastating wreckage has prompted other nations to support a newly-created disaster relief . Peter Beckwith . [ News anchor ] There are no estimates yet as to the total financial impact . We now turn our attention to a natural phenomenon we can all get behind , adorable kittens . That 's adorable ! Ol ' Petey 's got a lot of fight in him . You see ? Television , it teaches us so much about the world ! Yeah . Misty Kerkovitsky . [ Janet ] You 're going too fast ! Problem , Janet ? [ Janet ] The files are piling up . Can you slow down a bit ? Uh , if I slow down , we 're not gonna get this done in time , so you 're just gonna hafta kick it up a notch . [ Janet ] I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I shouldn 't even be here . I can 't handle this ! Do not ruin this for the rest of us , Janet . [ Janet ] It 's just , I 've told you how demanding Nana can be , especially during psoriasis season . There are so many itchy areas she can 't reach on her own . ( buzzing ) Did you just hang up on me ? You mean like this ? I 'm just not accustomed to this pace , and I 'm afraid I might make mistakes . Alternatively , perhaps I could come back tomorrow , no charge , of course , and just finish up what I didn 't get to today . Dawn is the deadline , Janet . Dawn . Okay . What you need is an assistant ! Dormant . Post-dormant . Gorg ? And a fine " gorg " to you too , Mort ! As you know , Mort has always possessed the physical fortitude of a donkey . He now has the mind of one , too . He can take on any size workload . No doubt , he 'll be a great help to you . Now get back to work . You 're welcome . Mort ? You 're alive ? Okay . So , um , the South American cards need checking , and those boxes . Mort . Mort , my eyes are up here . That 's it . You have beautiful eyes . Oh , thank you . Anyway , we really have to get to work , because ... Beautiful eyes . If you can , if you can get those cards . EYES ! ( bell ringing ) It 's break time . Mandatory party games . That way . [ Mort ] Duck ! Duck ! Duck ! Duck ! Duck ! That is not how the game is played ! Maybe that earthquake was just a coincidence . Yeah , right . And Mort was just " napping . " Yeah , Oooh , look at you . Sarcasm , I like it . Really ? Yeah . I think I might try to be more sarcastic in the future . You should . Would you guys shut up ? I 'm trying to plan the holiday I 'm taking with that severance check . Misty , don 't you think that there 's something strange going on here ? No . Everything seems perfectly normal . Except Mort smells worse than usual , and tomorrow we 're all gonna be rich . [ Mort ] Chicken duck ! Ah ! ( bell ringing ) It is time to resume working . Okay , probably wasn 't a coincidence . Yeah , I don 't think so . [ Radio reporter ] A freak tsunami has struck the Caribbean , causing mass devastation to Jamaica and Trinidad . The Ambergris Isles have been swallowed by the sea , utterly obliterated . All of its citizens are dead . Folks , the Ambergris Islands no longer await you . Meet me in the broom closet . I was wondering when I 'd get my turn . Shut up . [ Janet ] I 'm sorry , I just feel slightly uncomfortable with this arrangement . I honestly don 't see the problem . Um , well , it 's just that I feel , just a little , well , uneasy working with Mort now that he 's a zombie . Good , good Mort , bravo ! Oh , that 's rich . [ Esther ] Yes , this is Esther . Esther , you 're gonna love this . Janet thinks Mort is a zombie ! Well , if he 's not a zombie , then what is he ? He is , eight-seven-three-decimal-nine four-space-eight-hyphen-aught-n space-six-dash-four-four-twospa . Status , post-dormant . Now get back to work . [ Janet ] Aah ! No thank you , Morty . Thank you . You can eat it , you can eat it . Psst . Meet me in the broom closet . Oh ! Uh , well , I 'm flattered , but I don 't think that you and I ... Well , it 's just that I 'm not a ... Oh , God ! Why does everyone here act like I 'm some kind of slutty slut whorebag ? Ho-bag . Just come ! Okay . [ Misty ] I sent up seven cases from the Caribbean Islands half an hour ago . And now there are no Caribbean Islands . [ Jason ] And when Godfrey decided he didn 't like that news anchor , he was dead , within seconds . The Australian earthquake , the Caribbean Islands . It 's like Godfrey 's summoning the end of the the world . [ Misty ] And even if Godfrey keeps his word , and lets us go free after giving us the money , what the hell are we gonna spend it on ? I 've seen the movies . No one shops after the apocalypse . I am never gonna get to go to an all-inclusive , and drink my face off ! We have to tell someone , we have to tell them what 's going on here . God , yeah , right ! Try to leave and you 'll end up like Mort . Balloon ! Ew ! Icky , nasty ! Bad ! We have to call 911 . [ Jason ] Uh , hello , how long have you been working here ? There 's no cell reception in this building . And the business phones were disconnected . Except for Esther 's . [ Janet ] Right . Right ! Okay , okay , so , What if I sneak into her office and call 911 ? What can I do ? You and Mort , you guys , you watch Godfrey , you keep him off the third floor . [ Jason ] No problem , he loves me . Misty , do you think you could distract Esther while I go in ? Sure . Is that okay ? That hag comes at me and I 'll rip her tits off . But if I 'm gonna do this , you have to promise me one thing . Because I don 't want Godfrey bringing me back like he did Mort . Mort . Ugh . God , you gotta burn me up , or chop me up , or dissolve me in a vat of battery acid . Where would I find a vat of battery acid ? Wherever , just be creative . Just please , please promise me . Okay , well , what size chunks do I have to chop you into ? Jason ! Okay , I promise ! All right ! Let 's do this . - [ Mort ] Mort . - [ All ] Aaahhh ! Esther ? Why have you abandoned your work station ? [ Misty ] Oh , is this the portion of the evening allotted for work ? I thought this was the portion of the evening allotted for " Misty / Esther Girl Time ! " There is no portion of the evening allotted for ... Oh , but you 're wrong . Haven 't you seen the schedule posted down by the elevator ? I did not authorize any such posting . Well , it 's posted there . Come see . ( quirky music ) I see no such posting . You see no such posting ! ( Misty laughing ) This portion of the evening has not been allotted for laughter . You know why you see no such posting ? Because this is the portion of the evening allotted for lying . That is not true . Exactly ! Because this is the portion of the evening allotted for lying . That is not true . This is the portion of the evening allotted for fucking with Esther 's mind ! THAT IS NOT TRUE ! [ 911 Operator ] 911 . Where are you phoning from ? Godfrey Global Inventory . [ 911 Operator ] Gopher Globule who , ma 'am ? You are afraid . Actually , I 'm not . Watch this . ( Spits ) [ Esther ] That is a direct violation of company policy ! It is on now , bitch ! No , no , Godfrey Global Inventory ! [ 911 Operator ] There 's no Groggy Gogo Factory listed in our records . So it 's Godfrey Global Inventory ? Yes ! Now I don 't have much time , so please listen carefully ! [ 911 Operator ] Shhhh ! What was that ? What was that ? Hello ? [ 911 Operator ] Did you hear that , Elliott ? It came from outside . I must be hearing things . Sorry , ma 'am , what were you saying ? My name is Janet Crimple . The world is going to end tonight if you don 't come right now . [ 911 Operator ] Hold please , ma 'am . There it is again . Hear that ? Jesus ! Did you see that , Elliot ? Did you see that ? Jesus God ! They 're coming through the window ! What , exactly , is coming through the window ? [ 911 Operator ] I 've never seen so many raccoons ! AAAAAAAAAAH ! [ 911 Recording ] Your call is important to us . Please wait for the next available operator . No , no , no . [ Esther ] I shall file an incident report with Mr. Godfrey immediately . [ Jason ] Oh my God . ( dismal music ) [ Jason ] Jason here . Third floor . Come , now . [ Jason ] Janet ? Are you okay ? You made a promise . Esther did this ? How ? She 's like a million years old ! I know . [ Jason ] Oh my god ! Misty ! [ Janet ] Jason , there 's no time to mourn . You know what you have to do . No , I , No , I can 't ! This is Misty ! No , she wants me to . I know , I know , but you promised ! You have to . Okay , okay ! Okay , how ? I don 't know .

I 'm counting on my dependable employees to muster up that good ol ' Godfrey Global spirit to get the job finished by the deadline ! And if we refuse ? That 's all right . Mort here refused , and he 's still working ! Sort of . Aren 't ya there , big guy ? Please . A post-dormant worker is better than no worker at all . Hey , Mr. Godfrey , I hear you are short-handed . [ Godfrey ] Yes , as a matter of fact , we are . I can help you . Why , that would be marvelous . For million dollars . Deal or no deal ? Welcome aboard . As a matter of fact , I 've already taken the liberty of pulling your punchcard . Oola . As you were . ( bell ringing ) It 's time to resume working . What are you doing ? You think I stupid ? I got plan . This girl look out for number one . [ Jason ] Oola says that she 's got a plan . We should make a plan . I know , but what can we do ? I mean , if we leave , he 'll just punch our cards . If we slow down . [ Janet ] He 'll punch our cards . [ Jason ] And if we refuse to work . [ Janet ] He 'll just punch our cards , and turn us into whatever Mort is . Who are you guys ? We 're waiting on you , Janet . Go ! Go ! Coming right up , Mr. Godfrey . ( quirky music ) So , uh , what 's your plan ? [ Oola ] Get my punchcard . [ Jason ] How ? Take it . Take it ? You seriously think it 's gonna be that easy ? [ Oola ] Yup .

Great ! [ Jason ] Yeah , that chick is so into me . You know , maybe Godfrey 's not gonna do it . Maybe he 's just gonna give us a million dollars and let us live . No . Think . Janet , he never said he would let us live . He said he 'd give us a million dollars . He never said he 'd let us live . Is there a problem here ? No , no problem at all , sir . Do you know where 's there 's really no problem ? Downstairs . " Post-Dormant Morty . " He 's the ideal employee . Perhaps I should ... [ Janet ] No , no , no . No .

( quirky music ) [ Jason ] So , you didn 't get our punchcards . And here I thought that you were some big , hot shot pickpocket . Oh , Godfrey not human . He demon ! With eyes in the back of hand ! Lucky for me , demon like " tickle-tickle . " Do you really think that Godfrey 's a demon ? Shhhh ! Like , an entry-level minion demon , or a chief executive demon ? Are you all cozy in there ? [ Jason ] All hail the dark lord ! All hail the dark lord ! Beg pardon ? I 'm sorry . I was ... I was assuming that that was the correct . Anyhow , I have a hunch that you have some big plans for the future , Mr. Godfrey , and I want in . Really ? Yes . Big , dark , evil plans . Really ? Yeah . And I 've goosed my r√©sum√© to accentuate some of my more , oh , diabolical characteristics . You sang in a Presbyterian boys ' choir ? Yeah , but read below that . I lip synced the whole time . I never actually sang a note . Take that , God ! God ! And I 've worshipped graven images . I worshipped the Miss October centrefold so hard that it got moldy . You are telling me this why ? [ Jason ] Because I want in , Mr. Godfrey , on the whole anti-Christ action . Look , I even got a tattoo ! " 999 ? " No , six , oh ! That 's magic marker . [ Jason ] Yeah , but I 'm totally gonna get it inked once I cash my severance check . Which I hope isn 't even a severance check at all , because I wanna keep serving you , sir . Whatever you may need , I am so down for it . Hmmm . Whatever I need ? Whatever you , uh , you need . Where have you been ? I don 't wanna talk about it . What time is it ? It 's 5 : 06 . We 're running out of time . - 5 : 13 ! - What is it ? [ Janet ] 5 : 13 , it 's the question and answer portion of the evening ! The question and answer period has begun . Is Nana still alive ? [ Godfrey ] Your Nana died peacefully in her sleep several hours ago . No ! What about the rest of us ? [ Godfrey ] Now , now , Janet . It 's our turn to ask you questions . This is so exciting . The question is , now that you 're not shackled to that cruel , rotting , parasite . Why are you crying , Janet ? Parasite ? Don 't you talk about my Nana like that ! With the shrewd eye of a slave trader , " Nana " plucked you from the foster home at the age of six , enlisting you into a life of dismal servitude in her cold and loveless home . A life laden with constant reminders to ... Oh . ( in Nana 's voice ) Thank your lucky stars I took you in , Janet , 'cause your crackhead Mama sure didn 't want you ! If I hadn 't of saved you , you 'd be paddling bare-handed up a creek full of shit , Janet ! Janet ! Where 's my ointment ? Yeah , Janet , WHERE 'S MY OINTMENT ? STOP ! Nana may have loved her ointment , but she was a really kind of a vicious , vicious woman ! Wow . Is it my turn to ask a question ? Yes . And that was it . But , I ... The question and answer period is over . But what about the rest of us ? Back to work now , Janet . [ Janet ] Will you let me live ? Do you really think you deserve to , Janet ? Because I 'm beginning to wonder myself . [ Janet ] " Do you really think you deserve to , Janet ? " Of course I deserve to live . I think . I do . I think I know I do . Oh ! But Nana 's dead , and ... Nana 's dead . And my life can finally begin . I deserve to live . So do you . So does Oola . Says Godfrey ? Says me . Oh . [ Janet ] We 'll ambush Godfrey and Esther when we 're all together . Whoa ! Whoa . Ambush . [ Janet ] Yeah . Yeah . What if , uh ... There 's no " what if " scenario worse than what happens if we don 't try to save ourselves . Oh , come on , Jason , work with me ! You 're supposed to be smart . Come up with a plan . You 're right , I am the smartest person here . And actionization strategies are my thing . Yaahr . Oh god , we 're doomed . What 's that ? Nothing . " Dawn is the deadline . " That 's what Godfrey said . What time does the sun rise ? ( quirky music ) ( bell ringing ) [ Esther ] It is time to stop working . It is also time to collect your severance bonuses . Stop by the office . This is Esther speaking . [ Janet ] So , this is it . What 's the plan ? [ Jason ] I 'm glad you asked that , Janet , because actionization , it 's more about finesse than brute force . All right . And ? [ Jason ] And I 'm gonna go in there and , uh . And I 'm gonna distract Godfrey with a bit of my trademark scintillating wit . And then Janet , you 're gonna flirt with Esther . What ? Yeah , don 't worry , you 're totally her type . Just flash her a little elbow skin . She likes that . And then while they 're distracted , Oola , you 're gonna go in Godfrey 's jacket pocket , and then just yoink . " Yoink ? " Yeah . That 's your plan ? " Yoink ? " Oola already tried picking Godfrey 's pocket , it didn 't work . Oh ! Well , what 's your brilliant plan , Janet ? Yeah , yeah , I 'd love to hear what the old maid has to say . Too bad Nana isn 't here to give you some advice ! I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . I promised I wouldn 't be such a dick , but my dickishness , it 's just so it 's just , it 's really entrenched in my personality . If only my mentor was here . Steve ! Why have you forsaken me ! " Steve ! " " Warrior fire . " You 're familiar with Shaman Steve 's teachings ? Uh , yeah . Yeah , yeah . I 've seen the infomercials . [ Jason ] And ? And it 's total horseshit , Jason ! Yaahr ! [ Mort ] Yaahr ! Come on ! You 're right . I know you 're right . What did that skeevy pony-tailed bastard ever do for me ? [ Oola ] Oh , blah blah blah . You guys talk too much . No , it 's gonna be fine . It 's gonna be fine . You just get in there . And you get your punchcard back . - Yeah . - Yeah . Great plan . Jackass . [ Oola ] You stay here . Sit down . Please . Stay . Sit . Mort lover . Not fighter . [ Godfrey ] Congratulations . You have succeeded in processing every last punchcard on the face of the planet . Except , of course , for these last remaining three . And the ones that Janet stole . [ Godfrey ] Yes , and the ones that Janet stole . You 'll return them now , Janet . No , I won 't . Yes , you will . Otherwise , I shall simply have to kill , eeny meeny miny . Jason ! No ! No , no , Janet , you can 't let him do this . Please . [ Godfrey ] Whaddya say , Janet ? You wanna watch Jason die ? Oh ! Take it . Take it all . Excellent . Now , thanks to you , all the good work at Godfrey Global Inventory is done ! As is the entire human race . And here is to a contract completed , and a job well done ! ( applause ) And now , I have some envelopes to distribute ! The first , for Janet . Our dear Janet . Janet ! For your craven loyalty to a thankless system of soul crushing monotony , and for your unwavering failure to show the slightest backbone even in the face of extreme evil . Your dogged servitude has been essential to the success of Godfrey Global . AAAAAAH ! Oola , catch ! ( struggle ) [ Godfrey ] I do not understand you people ! Instead of going to your graves with an extremely generous severance package , instead , you shall all be terminated without pay for this act of insubordination . You are all now officially [ Both ] FIRED ! And that 's what we 're all about . You did it . You saved us all . I didn 't save us all . I saved us three . Out of how many billions ? Still . High five , dude . I still breathing . He still breathing . You still breathing . Three 's a lot better than fuck all . You strong lady . You gotta be strong lady in this world to survive . What world ? ( music by Maria Molinari and Rohan Staton )

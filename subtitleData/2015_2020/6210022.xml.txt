 ( man ) previously on defiance ... Congratulations . You found yourselves an honest-to-goodness omec . ( amanda ) when the votan see you , All they see is a predator , Because that 's all they know of you . ( t 'evgin ) the omecs no longer consume The lesser races , But that is no concern of yours . I 'm here for my daughter . All right , here 's the deal . Our town needs gulanite badly . I suggest a sharing agreement , 50 / 50 . Our minds , your equipment . Everybody wins . You 're not a killer . You don 't know what it 's like , what killing does to you . - [ grunts ] - i don 't want you to know . What happened ? My weapon jammed . - Who is it ? - It 's v.C. Patrol . [ gunshot ] Would you kill this human In exchange for your husband 's life ? [ screams ] No ! ( pilar ) family 's more important Than anything else in this world , alak . I am christie 's mother . You can depend on me . I wish i could believe that . Pilar ? No , no , no , no , no , no ! Pilar ! Hey ! Hey , please ! She--she took my son . You will spy for me as a team , Both you and stahma . I bet you 're thinking there must be a catch . Well ... Bebe ? - [ grunts ] - ah ! [ groans and screams ] ( nolan ) " the ship began crumbling " around them in a violent monsoon of terra-rock . " the kaziri was in self-destruct mode . " wounded , bleeding , " there was no way nolan could make it out on his own . " so irisa hoisted him over her shoulders . " as his hot , human blood mingled with hers , " she pulled the man she called father to safety . " to freedom . To defiance . " Oh , do you want that ? Here . No ! You know , my favorite part Is the part where you carve up The e-rep battalion And use them as a stepladder . I don 't care . It 's garbage . [ both grunt ] [ laughs ] Nope . Uh-uh . Daddy 's reading . Hey , listen up , the stasis nets Were down to let in a supply convoy , And a roller came in out of nowhere . They blew through the gates . V.C. Markings . They 're headed straight for town . [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ [ tires screech ] ¶ ¶ Vehicle approaching ! Fire on my command . [ tires screech ] Wait . Hold your fire ! What are you doing barreling in like that ? My husband 's in urgent need of medical attention . Please . I could have shot you . [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ I stabbed the liberata in the throat with my shiv , But he made enough noise to attract the guards . We had to run for it across open territory towards the vehicles . Bullets were tearing over our heads . It was a miracle that we made it to the roller . I pulled stahma behind me , but alak ... Alak was gone . We searched through the night , but when day came , we ... We had no choice but to leave . We can only pray to rayetso That alak and the baby can find their way home . [ cries ] Whoa there , trigger . You 're going to open it back up . He 'll be fine . Thanks , doc . I didn 't do it for you . Do you know where the camp is ? Somewhere in the bordeen valley . That 's half a day 's drive from defiance . - How many troops they got ? - It was at least a hundred . They kept us both blindfolded . You were seen leaving town with rafe mccawley . What are his whereabouts ? [ sniffles ] Rafe , christie , and quentin are dead . Those v.C. Gwoninjos massacred an entire family . - All of them . - No . No , no . - No ! - [ gasps ] [ sobbing ] ( amanda ) quite an arsenal . I 'm a big guy . I can carry a lot . Look , i know you 're hurting . Yeah ? Yeah . I 've known the mccawleys a long time . Rafe , he was my first friend here in defiance , And i used to babysit christie . But we can 't make this about them . Appreciate the advice . I need you to get intel . All right ? Troop movements , personnel counts , Armament details , and then i need you To get your ass back here in one piece . Don 't worry about it . I don 't have to tell you we 're walking Into a nest of stone-cold killers . So don 't . I need to know i can count on you . Don 't be stupid . [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ [ engine starts ] ¶ ¶ Home at last . It doesn 't feel the same . [ tranquil music ] ¶ ¶ [ gasping softly ] [ datak clears throat ] [ gasps ] - Testing the tub for leaks ? - [ chuckles ] Favis ... ( stahma ) it 's all right , darling . Best to keep the plumbing active . If i may , did you find alak ? We have . Is he all right ? For now . Andina , go prepare dinner . Why did you tell her alak is alive ? She 's sworn to us . She can be trusted . We can 't trust anyone . If we 're caught , we will be executed for treason . Rahm tak will kill alak . Our grandchild will grow up an orphan . Shall i slit andina 's throat ? Would that make you happy ? Andina ! You 're a child . Come in here , please . I 'm a professional criminal . I know who i can and cannot trust . - Yes , favi ? ( both ) get out ! We came to this town with nothing But the clothes on our backs . And i did whatever was necessary To provide for and to protect this family . And i will continue to do so , And i will do it without your input . [ water sloshes ] [ grunts ] [ groans softly ] Are you going to bathe on your own again , my dear , Or are you gonna help me get into the gwoking tub ? [ howling ] [ turns engine off ] Must be close . Rahm tak 's calling card . Well , we better bury them . I 'll get a shovel . [ chatter in native language ] Nolan , watch out ! [ shouting in native language ] [ groaning ] [ weapon whirs ] - [ speaking native language ] - Hey , pal . - [ speaking native language ] Thirsty ? I got a flask of slam in the back of the truck . - You guys okay ? - For now . These woods are dangerous . Come on , we 'll take your roller to my cabin . Come with me if you want to live . [ device beeps ] Just making sure you made it up there okay . Of course . Did you make sure the transmitter is well hidden ? Naturally . [ computerized beeping ] Remember , it needs to be unimpeded from the north . And don 't forget to tell them That nolan is heading in their direction . You take care of your end , i 'll take care of mine . [ grumbling ] yeah . [ indistinct chatter ] [ device powering on and off ] Is that my dad 's ? Used to be . This just came in . Guess what , alak . Defying my very low expectations , Your parents have successfully Established a communication link . They 've also warned me that the defiance town lawkeeper Is headed this way . Tell me about him . You know , i never actually met him . I 've--i 've always just tried to stay out of trouble . You 're an odd mutt . I mean , i see some of the noble refinement of shanje liro In the strong jawline , the bridge of the nose . But i also see the blunt arrogance Of your father 's yuke liro . [ grunts ] You are a sorry combination of qualities . Now , i 'll afford you that one mistake . Let 's start again . Tell me about the lawkeeper . His name 's joshua nolan . [ spits ] Joshua nolan ? The butcher of yosemite ? Yeah . Yeah . [ laughs ] He 's the scariest killer on the face of this earth , And he 's going to rip your jekking throat out When he gets here ! I was in yosemite . There was a lovely waterfall . It ran red with votan blood For days after joshua nolan massacred my comrades . It 'll be good to see him again . [ zipper zips ] ( pilar ) so what are a couple of arkhunters doing At the ass end of oklahoma ? Looking for the camp those soldiers came from . You 're looking for the v.C. ? - Mm-hmm . - You got a death wish ? I 'm a thrill-seeker from way back . What do you know ? The collective is bivouacked near pallahas ridge . There are blackberry bushes there , So i take my chances . Funny what you 'll risk your life for . - I could show you the way . - Appreciate that . Your baby 's awake . - Hi . - [ cries ] [ pilar sighs ] I found him in freeman , kansas , a couple of months ago . The v.C. Had swept through . Killed every man , woman , and child . But they missed this little sucker . He 's a survivor . [ baby coos ] Cold , hungry , never makes a fuss . What 's his name ? I call him bear , Because he hibernates just like one . Well , this is no place for an infant . We 'll drop you two back in civilization on our way through . Where are you headed ? East . Defiance . Defiance ? I always wanted to visit , See that big arch . [ chuckles ] count me in . Someplace warm , enough pow milk for my little bear , I 'd ride strapped to the hood if i had to . No need for that . We 'll leave at first light . Here , just in case . I won 't let you down . [ ominous music ] ¶ ¶ [ glass shatters ] [ grunts ] Oh , the badge suits you well . What are you doing ? I 'm here to retrieve Some personal effects from my roller . ( berlin ) you stole that roller from the v.C. , Who stole it from the e-rep . So it 's spoils of war , and it belongs to this town , Just like these weapons . That 's why i chose this particular vehicle . Prior to our escape , I saw soldiers loading the secret compartment . Let me be frank with you . My criminal interests have fallen to shtak In my long absence . Now , these weapons Will help me reestablish supremacy . Look , i 'm sorry for everything That you 've been through , But if we are attacked by the v.C. , We need every gun , rifle , and slingshot We have at our disposal . [ speaking native language ] Do you know what that means ? Your accent is a little thick for these human ears . The night of the mass killings at camp reverie , You were about to be executed . I saved your life . You can repay me now . All i 'm asking from you is to look the other way . Excuse me . I 'm sorry , but i can 't do that . Good day , deputy . Datak . [ gun cocks ] - stop . You wouldn 't shoot a cripple in the back , would you ? Yes , i would . [ laughs ] you 're too honorable for that , sweetie . Final warning . [ wheels squeak ] It rarely ends well for people who order me around . - Oh , i 'm devastated . [ handcuffs click ] I always felt a certain internal chemistry with you . Shut up . [ door closes ] The ridge is a couple of klicks north . There 's a back road , but it 's kind of overgrown . Hard to navigate unless you know it . Might be better if i drive . Hand me the tags . Transmission 's all but shot . Hard to get it out of second gear . I 'm actually a very good driver . [ baby coos ] It 's okay . I got it . I 'll ask one more time . You want my roller tags ? You 're going to have to kill me . [ weapon whirs ] That thing needs an actuator to fire . Give it to me . Rafe mccawley 's boots . Half-casti baby . Doesn 't take an indogene to figure out who you are . It 's a pleasure to meet you , pilar . That baby is the only thing i have left in my family . Please let me hold the child . What , the child you kidnapped ? That child ? The child i saved . I 'm not a criminal . You just tried to kill me and steal my roller . Only because i didn 't trust you . And you didn 't trust me either , Or you wouldn 't have given me a disabled weapon . Let 's call it even ! Hey , it 's okay . Oh , please don 't cuff me . The votan priests cuffed me , and they did terrible things . I just--the baby needs- - Come here ! One more word , one more , I 'm going to stuff a sock in your mouth . We 're going to take you both back to defiance . We 'll sort it out there . Until then , settle down and relax . Oh ! - No ! No ! - Let me have him . - Let me hold him ! - Hey ! Don 't kill her . Don 't kill her . I wasn 't planning to . [ grunting ] All right , we 'll be back for you . [ baby squeals ] Come on , let 's go . Whoa . What are you doing ? We can 't leave a baby . Why not ? - He 's happy . - He 's a baby . So ? Where 's he gonna go ? He 's a baby . You are very demanding . [ groans ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ Hello , datak . ( datak ) amanda . When i was driving towards defiance And i saw the glorious arch on the horizon , I thought it meant sanctuary . I was finally home . None of the many injuries you see on my body Hurt more than the shabby treatment i received At the hands of your pretty little lawkeeper . [ claps ] Sarcasm . You 're such a pro , amanda . You have anything else you want to get off your chest ? I paid dearly for those guns . I 've been tortured , humiliated . My son is likely dead . I have earned those weapons . We have an armory full of weapons . You really think those guns Are why i kept you locked up all night ? Then why ? Oh . You 're still angry about your sister . Every day you 've been away , I 've been waiting to hear news That either you or stahma , Preferably both , had been killed in the badlands . In my best daydreams , Your deaths were very slow and very painful . But now you 're back . And i have a choice . I can either focus on making you pay for kenya , Or we can move forward . If you assure me that you will put defiance first , If you swear to get the criminal element organized And fighting for the common good , If you promise to never cross me Or make me regret this decision ... [ speaking native language ] Say it in english . I promise . - You good ? - Let him out . Given our new understanding , Those weapons would be very helpful . Not going to happen . Those weapons are going to stay locked up safe In the town armory To help us win the war . ¶ ¶ [ music plays on stereo ] ¶ ¶ [ speaking omec ] - You are young to speak omec . - I 'm hardly fluent . In school , we studied your classics . The poems of lutenn were my favorite . [ laughs ] A recitation worthy of high marks . As your slave courtesans before fenuvano , Was it not expected of castithan women To recite your poetry ? Yes . That was a dark chapter in our history . Thankfully , we have matured . Evolved . Others have refused to move on . They are wary of us . But you , You are not . Perhaps i should be wary . In the bedtime stories of my childhood , The omec were known as furije nefkitso . As legend has it , If a girl was ever to cross paths with an omec , She would fall madly in love and be swept away In the dread harvest , never to be seen again . [ laughs ] But that 's just the stuff of fairy tales , is it not ? One can never be sure . I am eksu tsuroz t 'evgin . What may i call you ? Stahma . What have you purchased there , stahma ? Pain-relieving herbs . For my husband . Perhaps you can help me with a purchase of my own . I 'm looking for this thing they call sugar bread . The humans enjoy it . But ... But what ? As a connoisseur of the flesh , I would think an omec would prefer something A little more savory . [ chuckles ] I remember that feeling , When the arks finally left casti orbit . Relief . Reassurance that we would not perish By the heat of our own sun . And hope for a new beginning . My people shared that same hope . It did not last long . What happened to the omec ships ? They were sabotaged . Our leadership told us that your vessels had a design flaw . Your leadership lied . The votanis collective sent saboteurs , Indogene shape-takers , on a suicide mission . The votans feared that the omecs would steal this paradise , This earth , out from under them . They set bombs , Destroying our ships from within . But you survived . My ship , the tsuroz , was lucky . When the explosion happened , My daughter and i were on a space walk . Our vacuum suits protected us . We were able to repair the hull . The others on the ship , however , died from exposure . Oh , rayetso . I am sorry . So you and your daughter , you 're the only survivors Of your entire race ? I don 't know . Once my ship is fueled and repaired , I will return to space . If there are any survivors , i will find them , Whatever it takes . And you do not seek vengeance against the votan people ? Vengeance is a luxury i can ill afford . My primary concern Is to obtain gulanite , Fuel my ship , repair it , and rebuild my race . I once despised the humans . Pink-faced aliens who treated us like animals . Put us in camps , where we went hungry , fell ill . [ laughs ] But now you eat and drink beside them like nothing has happened . Why ? I fell in love with one . ¶ must be heaven ¶ Perhaps there is much to learn about these humans . I could offer you guidance . Lessons in their culture . ¶ i saw the evil ¶ [ suspenseful music ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ baby coos ] They got over a hundred men . 16 vehicles . [ sighs ] Even got themselves some volge . Oh , no . What is it ? ( nolan ) they got a net-cutter . Long-range vo-tech artillery . Built to blast through stasis nets . [ sighs ] All right . Let 's go . [ grunting ] We need to warn amanda . We need to blow it up . This is a recon mission . Used to be . There 's six grenades in there . I 'll get down to the camp , plant them on the tank . You cover me with this . - I should go . - Why ? Because if anyone sees a human , They 'll instantly sound the alarm . I 'll blend in better . It 's got nothing to do with this ? Firing a weapon ? You 're a better shot . I 'm a faster runner . ¶ ¶ Nice and easy , kiddo . [ indistinct chatter ] [ baby coos ] - shh . Can i help you ? [ baby cooing ] Zip it , munchkin . Back to sleep , okay ? Nighty night . All right . [ suspenseful music ] ¶ ¶ That 's it , kiddo . Let 's get it done . [ indistinct chatter ] - [ yells ] [ gunshot ] [ man shouts in native language ] Hargyi ! Intruder ! Hargyi , hargyi ! Hey , hey , hey . What 's happening ? Hey , what 's happening ? [ crying ] [ grunting ] [ yelling ] Stay where you are . You think i 'm afraid of you ? Back off . You 're not gonna shoot that poor child 's grandmother . Not right in front of him . Kids are surprisingly resilient . [ gunshot ] - [ grunts ] Joshua nolan ! Irisa . Where are you ? Sending a child to do the dangerous work ? Not much of a butcher , are you ? You 're a pork chop ! Come out of hiding , Or i will show you who the real butcher is . I am the butcher of ... Where are we ? Tulsa , sir . I am the butcher of tulsa ! [ gunshots ] [ grunting ] [ gasps ] Go on , do it . I have no regrets . Come on , kiddo . What are you waiting for ? Kill him . Second thoughts ? I have to admit , i 'm surprised . Come on . [ breathing heavily ] No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . [ gunshots ] [ men speaking native language ] Mississippi two-step . Okay . [ gasps ] [ men speaking native language ] [ suspenseful music ] ¶ ¶ How did you miss the car ? [ baby crying ] [ shushing ] ¶ ¶ ¶ hey , joe ¶ ¶ where you going ¶ ¶ with that gun in your hand ? ¶ ¶ hey , joe ¶ ¶ i said , where you going ¶ ¶ with that gun in your hand ? ¶ ¶ i 'm going down to shoot my old lady ¶ ¶ you know i caught her messing round ¶ ¶ with another man ¶ ¶ i 'm going down to shoot my old lady ¶ ¶ you know i caught her messing round ¶ ¶ with another man ¶ ¶ and that ain 't too cool ¶ You shouldn 't have given them bear . They 're his grandparents . So is pilar . You think she 's dead ? Can 't be 100 % sure . But even if she is still roaming around out there , The baby 's safe . That is , until rahm tak gets here . No , no . Don 't . You had him . The leader of the assault . And if you hadn 't have choked , Rahm tak would be a cooling corpse right now , And defiance would be a whole lot safer . We 're at war , kiddo , And you 've become an unreliable partner . ¶ ¶ [ speaking native language ] Joshua nolan ... [ speaking native language ] What ? Favi , we received a message from datak and stahma . Good news , i hope . They were successful in planting The shrill-infested weapons in the local armory . The town 's entire gun supply was destroyed . ( rahm ) not good enough . I want joshua nolan to know He can 't get away so easily . I want to make sure that butcher And his shtake little town Never forget who i am . Let 's shake them up a little bit . [ beeping ] What does it say ? What ? What is it ? What does that madman want ? He wants us to blow up the st . Louis arch . ¶ ¶

 This programme contains strong language and some violence . - Garry ? - This is not the only world , there are millions . And in every single one , he 's tried to kill us . The place we nicked the halogen lights from . That 's the same clue as before . Someone really wants us to get into that school . What if there 's another Milo out there and he 's trying to help us ? DOOR CRASHES OPEN CROWD SHOUT They 're through . Go , Milo ! No . I 'm not going anywhere without Danny . He chose to stay behind with Kate . He was willing to die for that choice . Are you ? Come on ! HE GRUNTS SWORDS CLASH GRUNTING YELLING That 's what you get for taking my fucking hat ! HE GROANS What the fuck you looking at ? ! Nothing , just tent pegs . Definitely not looking at you . Not looking at you . I think maybe I 'm not home after all . ♪ Your brains are dripping down , boy ... ♪ Hey . Pete ? We met ? No , no ... Oh ... What you eating ? Just a salami thing . It 's nothing special . I haven 't seen salami in a long , long time . OK . Oh ... Whoa ... Hand it over . You 're mugging me for salami ? While we 're at it , everything else he 's got on him . Clothes , wallet ... The lot . HE YELLS Come back ! HE PANTS Woo ! Hi . Sorry , there are some ... ruffians trying to take my clothes if you wish to ... arrest them . Right . Yeah . - Excuse me ... - Right , yeah , where are you going , cos they 're ... they 're that way ... ? Hands behind your back . You 're talking to me ? Hands behind your back ! All right , I think , think you 've made a mistake , I 've being running away from the criminals . I 'm the victim . You are under arrest . Don 't make this harder than it needs to be . I think you 've got the wrong person , mate . Well , you 're Milo Edwards ... aren 't you ? Uh , I mean ... HE GROANS Listen , I , er ... I hate to kick things off like this , but I do very much need to poo . Biological necessity . There it is , just something I need to do . Where 's Danny Gates ? I don 't know . Honestly , I don 't know . Now , will you ... tell me what this is all about ? What 's your angle ? Are you so arrogant that you thought that you could just walk into a police station and walk right out again ? Or did you want to be caught ? New idea - unless I make this face let 's just assume I have no idea what you 're talking about . Hmm ? Quantum genocide . Quantum ... quantum what ? They coined the term especially for you , for what you and Danny Gates have done . Right , listen , just listen . I 'm from another reality , and me and Danny , we met another Danny , who , who said something about Goldenmire and ... - So , you admit you know about Goldenmire . - It 's a name I heard . I don 't know anything . Just give us Danny , and there 's even a chance you won 't hang . ( Hang ? ) Hang ? As in , hanged ? With a rope and shit ? No , no , I mean , that 's crazy ... You can 't hang people . I would really rather not do this . Just confess . I can 't , I don 't even know what you think I 've done ! I am not messing about here , son . You 've got the wrong Milo , I swear ... Oh , right . That 's why we 've found all these photographs in your pocket . Photos of every reality you and Danny have visited . They 're not mine , they belong to another Milo . Oh , and I guess this notebook , that belongs to another Milo too , does it ? A precise list of locations , each in a different reality . That not yours either , eh ? You have to believe me . Please ... Please .. HUGH YELLS Gran ? Gran , is that you ? Oh , Milo . Gran , how long have I been here ? Thank you , I 'm so hungry . The service in here - pretty terrible . BREATHLESS HE GRUNTS HE PANTS I 'm not your Milo . You can see that , right ? They say you won 't tell them where Danny Gates is . Gran ... Other Milo 's gran , you 're certainly not mine , you have to believe me . I 'm from another reality . Another Milo sent me here , trying to ... set me up ... Stop it . Just stop it and listen . Tell them it was Danny . Tell them it was all Danny 's idea . Tell them he 's the one that stole the wristbands , he 's the one that wouldn 't let you come back home . Tell them you had no choice . People want revenge ! If you 're going to stand a chance of staying alive , you 've got to blame it on Danny ! SHE CRIES Please , Gran . Please ... You have to believe me , Gran ... My name is Milo Edwards . I hereby confess , of my own free will , that I stole two wristband devices belonging to Callum Stevens . Using these devices , I 've spent the past six years travelling through alternate realities . The stealing of the wristband devices was ... Danny Gates 's idea , and it was his idea to continue travelling through other realities , even though I asked him not to . I am not to blame for this . Danny is . ( You bastard . ) You bastard , you left me to fucking die ! You left me to fucking die ! No ! No ! He 's lying ! I swear he 's lying ! I 'm not your Danny ! I 'm not him ! OBJECTS SMASH I 'm not him , I 'm not your Danny ! I swear ! I swear ! He 's lying ! What if I told you this was all Milo 's idea ? Sign here ... Get yourself cleaned up for court . THE CROWD SHOUT ANGRILY CROWD STILL OUTSIDE CROWD SHOUT Get in ! Argh ! CROWD SHOUT AND JEER CROWD SHOUT Dan ? Dan ? How the hell ? When ... ? I thought you were back on the nuclear world ? I was . Till the bearded me and you dragged me to safety . They threw me through the gateway . Left Kate behind . I 'm sorry , dude . On the plus side , you 're here ! I thought you were dead , man ! - I know ! You sold me out . - What ? I saw it , Milo . Your entire confession . Blaming it all on me . Shit we never did , either of us ! Christ , Dan , I wouldn 't have said anything if I 'd known you were here ! I thought you were back in that crazy bunker . I 've been here for weeks , dude . Months even , I don 't know . They beat the shit out of me , Dan , I didn 't know what else to do . They did the same to me ! Only I didn 't crack . If I 'd known you were here , I wouldn 't have said a thing . How was I supposed to know you were on this world ? We didn 't do this , Milo , why would you confess ? This isn 't our fault . They 've set us up . Other us . They 've set us up . Danny . Milo . Dad . Are you here to defend us ? No-one else would take the job . No-one else wanted it . Nor did I , but your mother ... What can we do ? What are our chances , do you think ? - Keep quiet ... - Settle down . - .. and I 'll do everything I can to keep you alive . CROWD SHOUT Settle down . Hang him ! CLANGING We are here in the matter of the Crown and Milo Edwards and Daniel Gates . This is the first recorded instance of the charge of quantum genocide . The penalty if found guilty is death . CROWD : Yes ! Mr Gates , I believe a plea is being sought ? Yes , Your Honour , both Mr Gates and Mr , uh ... Edwards ... Edwards have signed full confessions . And I can see that each implicates the other . - You blamed it on me ? - You blamed it on me first ! Given the full and frank admission by both parties , we ask for leniency . The damage my clients have done to this world was not intentional . In exchange for a plea of guilty , we ask that the death sentence be commuted . That 's it ? " Don 't kill them , please " , that 's our whole defence ? It 's all we 've got . This whole thing 's crazy . Shouldn 't we have met our lawyer before the actual trial begins ? And what is this plea agreement ? This is just begging . Oh , yes , I forgot you were the expert . I 've represented myself in court , I had to know a thing or two . You would 've avoided having a criminal record if you 'd have just used a lawyer . 'Twas a human rights issue , so ... Smoking weed in the ladies toilet at Starbucks . Which is my human right , you dick ! - You 're the dick . This is all because of you . - You 're a dick . BELL RINGS Stop it ! Silence ! Mr Gates , kindly keep your clients under control . Six years ago , Milo Edwards and Daniel Gates stole technology from General Callum Stevens . Using this , they travelled to other realities . And every time they did so , they bled energy from our own . The laws of the natural universe no longer hold true . I find the accused extremely guilty . CHEERING And the sentence that they have handed down to our world through their selfishness is the same sentence I give them death . CHEERING You 'll be executed in the morning . How ? How can they do it so quick ? The whole thing was over in like ten minutes , and now they 're killing us tomorrow . What happened to appeals and due process ? Things have changed since the two of you left . No internet , no phones , no CCTV . The government 's grip has gone to shit . People are starting their own private armies . Most of Scotland is a no-go war zone . Not so different to where we 're from . Just trying to lighten the mood , Danny . The death penalty came back two years ago . Expedited judicial process was introduced a year ago . Rome is falling . HE CRIES My dad just hugged me . We are so dead . We are so dead . What if I pretend to choke on this ? You call the cops , they come running in , smack ! We take ' em out . - As plans go ... - Yeah ? ... It 's very shit . This porridge is just the right consistency . If the plan is to get the police to run in , then you can just pretend to choke . You don 't need to actually choke yourself with a porridge of the correct consistency , you colossal dickhead . At least I 'm trying ! Not like you just sitting there , sulking . I 'm not sulking , I am furious with you . You sold me out ! - You sold ME out ! - ou did it first ! You chose to stay with Kate instead of coming with me ! I felt bad for her , OK ? It wasn 't about you . It was , Danny . End of the day , you chose to have happy families with Kate - who isn 't even your Kate - instead of coming with me . I shouldn 't be surprised , though . You never do trust me . Didn 't even trust me enough to be your best man . Oh , fucking , fuck , fuck , fuck ! Why are we still talking about being best man ? ! - Hey . - Kate ? So , I heard that you handed yourselves in . No . No , no , no , you see , there 's been a mistake ... - What with ? - It 's not us . It 's not your Danny . I 'm the one you slept with back on nuclear world . Remember ? I was drunk , I had a fur coat ! That only proves that you saw me with another Danny . Just give up ! I know about the evidence , they found it in your pockets ! They set us up ! That was probably their plan all along - to con us into coming here so that we would take the fall . I was at the trial ! So just save me the excuses . HE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS Milo , leave off . Look , Kate , you have to listen to me . We 're really similar to the Danny you were with , but you have to understand , OK ... Milo ... Get off me ... Get off ... MILO CHOKES AND GASPS Are you serious ? For God 's sake , get up . Get up ! You 're doing it wrong , you need to put pressure UNDER the ribs ! What , like this ? For God 's sake ! No ! Come here . MILO GASPS FOR BREATH Wahhh ! - Milo ! - Oh , fuck ! If I can get us out of here , will you promise not to do any of that shit again ? Yes , yes , yes , please , let 's get out of here ! Good job . At least I tried . Kate , it 's not us . You have to believe me . Oh , my God . You 're not him . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you ! - You 're the drunk Danny I slept with in Nuclear World . - Yes ! The one who lasted five minutes and fell asleep still inside me ? - Uh ... well , I mean ... - That does sound like him . But if you 're not my Danny , then that means that my Danny 's still out there with Milo , dragging our world deeper and deeper into shit . Motherfuck ! So ... You 're gonna tell everyone that we 're not the ones you 're looking for ? Maybe ask them not to execute us tomorrow ? Yeah . Yeah , absolutely . And you can take us home ? I can . But I need your help . My Danny and Milo caused all this . - They deserve to be brought to justice . - But how can we help ? Cos you 're so similar to them . That 's why they chose you . Because you think like they do . So if you were finally free , where would you go ? - What kind of world ? - Mexico ? Ooh , big bag of weed , yeah . Although we 'd probably want to make sure that our plan actually worked first , considering all the shit that we 'd been through . So we 'd ... We 'd probably stay here . Yeah . We 'd make sure the versions of us were put to death . We 'd be in the crowd . So , you 'd show up in the middle of a bloodthirsty mob , just to see yourselves die ? - And we 'd bring snacks . - Peperami . - The spicy one . - Mild for me . Cause of his bunghole . Do you really think they 'll show ? It 's what we 'd do . So , can we go home now ? After . After ? What do you mean " after " ? They 're not going to show up if there 's no execution to show up for . It 'll just be for show . You 'll be led out , and we 'll let it carry on for as long as it takes to find them . Now , you should probably get some sleep . HIGH-PITCHED : It 's going to be fine . HE CLEARS THROAT It 's gonna be fine . Don 't talk to me . CROWD BAY AND YELL How long do we stand here , dude ? I mean , you 're not going to kill us , are you ? Huh ? Cos Kate did tell you about the plan ... Didn 't she ? - Did she ? - Hold still ! OK . Oh , shit , shit , shit . Where 's Kate ? Where 's Kate , where 's Kate ? Danny , where is Kate ? ! Milo Edwards and Daniel Gates , you have been found guilty of quantum genocide . You shall be hung until you are dead . Wait , wait ... Kate ! Kate , pull the plug , this isn 't working ! May God have mercy on your soul . Wait , wait , wait ! Wait , wait ! Don 't I get some last words ? Milo Edwards wishes to say some final words . CROWD BOOS Quiet ! Enough . - What are you doing ? - Buying us time . So ... ahem . I am Milo Edwards . And these are my final words . I didn 't do anything , all right ? And I 'm not guilty ! All right ... CROWD BOOS All my life , I 've been looking for meaning . You see , ever since my gran died , I 've just ... drifted around , smoking a lot of weed , watching a lot of box sets and thinking about doing a lot of stuff , but never actually doing any stuff . And then this guy appears with a sword and he tries to kill me and I stepped through into another reality . And all I can think about is ... I wanna go home . I really , genuinely just wanna go home . I just want to get up off my arse and grab life by the balls ! I mean I 've seen all these different versions of me and I 've realised that maybe I 'm not that bad . Maybe , just maybe , someday , I can be somebody . CROWD : Kill ' em ! Fucking hell , I didn 't expect it to go like that ! Hang them ! - Wait , don 't I get to say anything ? - Nah . Hang ' em ! Wait , no , no , don 't ... Sorry , buddy . I 'm sorry for everything . - I love you , pal . - I-I love you too . - We should go . - Hm . Miss me ? Get them ! It 's them ! What 's going on ? HORSES WHINNY Fucking Paul ! Fear not Lads , I 'm Team Danny 'n ' Milo to the end ! Oh , you should probably get out of here actually ! Oh , fucking Paul ! I knew I liked that guy ! Unlike Kate , leaving us there to hang . There we are . Who-o-oa ! - What you doing ? - They must know the way out ... I meant why are you following me ? - I thought it was every man for themselves ? - I 'm following THEM ! I 'M following them ! That 's MY thing ! - Well , Milo , now really isn 't the time ... - Oh , thank the Lord ! Oh , J-Jesus Christ , it 's cold . V-v-very observant . - What are you doing HERE ? - What are you doing here ? Oh , I guess I shouldn 't be surprised . If anyone was going to follow us here , it was gonna be you . It 's not just us . There was a hell of a lot of people chasing us and when they find that gateway , you are gonna be in a world of shit . The gateways we make , only us and Kate can use . Even Callum can 't follow us . Something to do with the wristbands , they 're prototypes , we reckon . - Hit ? - You set us up ! You wanted us to be hanged for something that you did ! Calm down . You fuckers ! You forget . We think the same . Except I 'm better . There you go . So what are you going to do with us ? Rest up , then we 're gonna send you back to get executed . And then maybe , maybe we can finally stop looking over our shoulders , eh ? So what are the gateways ? You know , the one from the graveyard , the bunker ... If you already had the wristbands , why d 'you need another way of getting around ? We don 't mean to create them . They just happen . Every time we jump into a reality , we create a gateway . They appear wherever we go and we have no idea how to get rid of them . Truth is , we just sort of press the buttons , hope for the best . Ain 't that right ? There you go . Yeah , but what about the clues ? Woolly mammoth meat ? I can see why these bastards went extinct , they taste amazing . Yeah , but what about the clues ? We got separated early on . Him and Kate were together , I was on my own , so I started leaving clues . I followed the trail . We met up , and we promised we 'd never ever let that happen again . So now , whenever we jump , we leave a clue and we write it down in our log books . Like the one you left in my jacket . So how 'd you find us ? Ha ! That was just right time , right universe . We were being chased by Callum and we got split up . Milo came back here . I ended up on your world and as soon as I saw you two , I just knew . Ha-ha ! Fucking yes ! Run Forrest ! Danny ! It 's Kate from the last world . How did you get here ? Please , please , you have to help us . You have to help us ! I 'm trying , OK ... the lock 's stuck ! I see you found my collection . Why are you doing this ? They 're prisoners . They 're the best of the best . Any time I find a Kate I like , I bring her back here . And I just know you of all people will appreciate ... I 've never met a Kate I didn 't like . Mnaaah ! KATE WHIMPERS Ah ! Now , if you run again we 're going to cut you up and stick you on the barbecue . Good effort though , buddy . Good effort . What are you grinning about , you dick ? You are responsible for ruining your own world . Ah , well , we never asked to jump around different realities . We were just dicking about , trying not to let that Callum guy hurt us . I mean , why should we be executed for just having fun ? - Eh ? - Fun ? People are dead ! " People are dead . " How have you spent the last six years getting chased by a guy with a sword and still know next to nothing about how or why ? - I think I 've had enough of these two . - Me , too . Hey , hey , hey . Let 's not be hasty , huh ? What about the plan ? Sending us back , yeah . Seems like that could take a while . Fuck that . Playing with yourself again , Milo ? Kate ? How did you find us ? I followed you . - Which ones ? - Does it really matter ? Kate . You 're here ! Back off . I 'm taking you back and I 'm handing you in . To be killed ? Why ? Because you left me behind . No , we didn 't . That was an accident . It was no accident , Danny . Milo left me stranded . Is that true ? Er , I , er ... I was ... Go on , tell him . She was ruining it ! Dan , she kept talking about going home . Is it weird that I feel like we 're intruding ? We 've been living it up since we ditched her . Remember the money we made in Vegas , the twins in Naked World ... ? I could 've died . I really wish you hadn 't done that , Milo . But I thought we were friends . Jesus Christ , Danny . I 'm still handing you in . I missed you , Kate . Without you , it just ... It wasn 't the same and Milo deserved that . But without you in my life , I had to turn to others , which means , sadly , I no longer have any use for you . Jesus , this version of me 's a psycho ! Go , Kate ! Go ! Stab him in the head ! In the head . In the other man ! Go ! I don 't want to do this , Kate . I can 't . I can 't hurt you . Take me back . Take me back home . Don 't ! I 'm lying ! Don 't ! HE GIGGLES Oh , I really am sorry , my one true shit-for-brains . SCREAMS Girls . Don 't be hasty . Argh , argh ! Hold on ! Just like that ? We 're home ? Just like that . How do we know ? Well , it 's warm and there 's no-one trying to kill us . It 'll do . Don 't know about you , guys , but I could do with a beer . Definitely . Yeah . Come on , then . Can I see you inside ? Oh , right , yeah . Course . - Usual ? - Yeah . So , this is it . Yeah . Hey , how can you use a wristband and jump wherever you want , but other us had no idea ? You guys never did . Right . That does sound like us . But , I , I still don 't understand . What about Callum , you know ? Who is he ? How did he make the wristbands and what the actual fuck is going on ? It 's over . You 're home . You don 't have to worry about this any more . Unless ... You could come with me . - What ? - I know that my world 's a scary place , but I have to go back to return this and let them know it 's over . Look , what we shared was ... Brief . - But nice . - Very nice . But , I have a Kate of my own and I 'm supposed to be marrying her . Even though you cheated on her . It 's complicated . Well , I 'll see you around , Shitface . Laters , Tunavag . Where are they , hm ? Where are Milo and Danny ? Where did you take them ? SHE SCREAMS OK . SHE SCREAMS You won 't find the Milo and Danny from this planet . They died . Then they can 't be the ones I 'm looking for . We 've saved each other 's lives . We 've sold each other out , and ... this shit . I , I honestly don 't know ... Are we friends any more ? I mean , it 's been tough , but I don 't see why ... - 12th of May . Oh fuck , fuck , fuck . - What ? What ? What ? My wedding 's tomorrow . Kate 's going to be worried sick ... Kate , again ? I thought you wanted to ... talk . Danny ? Danny , where ... ? Where have you been ? Oh , God , I missed you so much . I thought maybe you 'd just ran away . The engagement party was too much and you couldn 't handle it . Why else would Milo disappear at exactly the same time ? That 's not what happened . Danny , do you still want to get married ? What ? I mean , you asked me and I 'm happy that you did , but we 've never ... We 've never actually talked about it . We 've never actually sat down and said , " Is this what we want ? " All of this crazy shit that I 've seen , it 's made me realise how lucky I am . I do want to marry you . I want that more than anything . So , just tell me the truth . All this crazy stuff about parallel worlds . Just tell me where you 've been . Has there been someone else ? Have you cheated on me ? Technically , no . INCESSANT KNOCKING AT DOOR I need to speak with Kate . Milo ... Kate , Danny chose you . He chose you over me and it 's bothered me for a long time . Milo , look this is really not a great time . Just listen . I 've done some thinking . And this is what I 'm thinking . I want us to get along , OK , because I 've seen what happens when we don 't . So , me and you need to , you know , find a way to get along and like each other . What did you mean that you technically cheated on me ? Oh , so that 's what you mean by " This isn 't a great time . " Go , go , get out ! What 's going on ? - These two ... - I 'm sorry . - .. have been trespassing , haven 't you , boys ? Passing through the fabric of reality , watching what happens when different decisions are made . It 's all about choice , isn 't it ? Free will . If you 're going to kill us , just do it . Stop talking shit . - No , no , no ! - Don 't do that ! I don 't want to kill you . I want to find something out . I want to test you . I want you to choose . Whose life do you save ? Your best friend or your fiancee ? - Why ? Why do you want me to choose ? Because I want to . Because I want to . Because I want to . - No . - No , I 'm not doing it . I know you 're going to choose Kate . It 's fine . No , it 's not fine . He 'll choose you , like he always does . Just like he did after our engagement party . Oh , every reality we go to , he 's blabbing on about , " Oh , Kate . Where 's Kate ? " And at home all he ever talks about is Milo . " Milo this and Milo that . " This is entertaining , but I don 't have all day , so let 's put a little clock on this , shall we ? Ten , nine , eight ... - I don 't want to die . - .. seven . Choose , Danny . One will die . Choose . Six , five , four three , two ... - No ! Danny ? I 'm sorry we had to do it like this . It 's true , man . The prophecy come true ! Oh , fucksticks . Subtitles by Ericsson

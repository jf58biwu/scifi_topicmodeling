 Visitation starts in 20 minutes . - what 'd he do with it ? What did he do with it ? - Hey , sexy . Tell me about the day David came to live with you . - Why ? - A man brought him , yeah ? - I was four . - But you remember . Don 't lie ! - It was late . I was in my room and I heard voices . So I snuck out onto the landing . For a long time , I thought it was a dream . - Yeah , that was him . Oh , what did he do with it ? What did he do with it ? - What did he do with it ? - Why are you doing this ? He was just a baby . - Uhh , he 's not a baby now . Uh-oh . Looks like one of the animals is out of its pen . Fascinating . You 've manifested your cryogenic state into a literal ice cube . When I woke up this morning , I thought to myself , it 's gonna be daylight savings soon . Then I realized , I don 't know what that means . - It 's when you set the clocks forward or back to maximize daylight during the work day . - Huh . That 's not very interesting . I thought we were literally saving daylight . - My god . Oliver , you haven 't aged an hour . - Oh , no , whoa . - Oh , oh , oh . Wait till Melanie sees . - Melanie ? - Your ... your wife . - My wife ? Is she ... For some reason I wanna say ... Chinese ? - No , she 's not Chinese . - Got it . Japanese ? - No , not Asian in any way . No . - Ahh . Hm . Good to know . I 've been in here a long time , you see . Or at least , I think I have . Hours ... or , what 's longer than hours ? Years . My memory 's a bit , um ... It 's a bit , uh ... Oh , what 's the word ? What 's the word ? Dishes ? No . Anyhow , I supposed we 'd better rescue them , then . Your friends . I 've been watching you see this ... uh , this David person and his monster . It can 't find us in here , in case you were worrying . - The parasite . - Yes , that 's what I said . Parasite . - Mental , obviously . - Yes , a separate consciousness from David has attached itself to him and has been ... - using his power to feed its own . - You 're not ... are you gonna do that the whole time ? - Do ... do what ? - Finishing my sentences . - No , sorry . Old habit . - A tenor , perchance , are you ? - A tenor ? - We 're starting a barbershop quartet , David and myself . " Roll out the barrel , " that kind of thing . Nothing serious . Just fun . Oh , which reminds me . You know what it is , don 't you ? - I 'm sorry . Having a little trouble keeping up . - What ... - the monster . You know what it is . Or should I say who . Farouk . I read David 's mind , you see , when they were trapped here . He and David . He 's very clever , our monster . But he puts all his energy into tricking David . Didn 't think to watch his six . And by six I mean ... - What do I mean ? - Wait , wait , you 're saying ... Of course ! Amahl Farouk . I should have known . The dog ! - Oh . There 's a dog ? - In David 's memories , he 's disguised himself as a really ... A very cute , little beagle . But the name ... king ... I should ... Amahl Farouk . The shadow king . - We have to rescue them . - Didn 't I just say that ? I 'm sure I said that . Rescue them . After the whole Chinese wife debate , which I 'm still not totally convinced . Are you sure she 's not ? Because I seem to have a very intimate recollection of one night ... All right , then . Then the next question is : How ? How do we rescue them ? We are just minds , after all . And their bodies ... Are in quite a jumble . Facing certain death , and all that . He 's too powerful for me . Farouk . He 's too virile , psychically . David could break you out of the dream , possibly all of you . But he 's compromised , currently . - Farouk has locked him away in a tiny corner of his mind . He 'll be gone entirely , soon . And then the shadow king will become David . It 's too much vermouth . You want me to put a little bit more vodka in there ? - David . My device . I made a halo , randomly firing electromagnetic signals in a 360 degree radius , which should ... if we can put it on David 's head ... The real David ... In the now-frozen timeline , it should block the shadow king . Isolate it and end the hospital fantasy . - Unfreezing time and executing your friends in a hail of bullets , unfortunately . Unless we can physically change the dynamic of the room . Block the bullets , move the bodies . We 're gonna need everybody . - Let me introduce you to my friend , Jules Verne . - It 's all right . He can 't hear us in here , the monster . He 's very powerful , but Oliver has a few tricks - left up his sleeve . - First of all ... - Syd , it 's easier if I just talk . - The hospital wasn 't real . - No shit . - Well , to be accurate , there is a real hospital , - but we weren 't there . - It was a mental projection , created by the monster . - I 've been paying attention . - Right , well , so our ... - our bodies are in David 's childhood bedroom , probably frozen in time . And if I remember it right , someone just fired a machine gun . So I 'm thinking , when time starts again , - we 'll all be killed . - Yes . Wow ! - What we have to do is distract the monster ... Who looks like Lenny but isn 't ... So we can save our bodies , without her knowing . And then find a way to end the hospital fantasy - and save David . - Right . And there 's a ... There 's a device . - I built a ... - great , so I 'll go to the hospital and save the others and deal with Lenny and you fix it . So I 'm not murdered when I wake up . - Are we good ? - Yeah , that 's what - I was gonna ... - great , let 's go . - Okay ... wait , wait , wait . You 'll need these . Oliver made them . That 's Melanie 's ... ahh ... Anyway , he has some control here . And he made these to help us . They 'll show you what 's real and what isn 't . These are for the others . Try not to draw attention to yourself . Because Farouk is watching . - Farouk ? - Yeah , it 's a long story . Just maintain the illusion . And be ready . I 'll send a signal when I 'm in place . - This oughta be interesting . I 'm coming for you , baby . - David ! - Come with me . - No . - Oliver . Oh . I thought you were ... - set them along the perimeter . - On the chest of a barmaid in sale , were tattooed the prices of ale . And on her behind , for the sake of the blind , was the same information in braille . Mm . Oliver bird . Dedicated follower of fashion . Have I seen you before ? At the poetry slam ? - No . - You do seem familiar , though . What did you say your name was , again ? No . Don 't tell me . I 'll remember . Whoo , what a pickle . Where did you say that device was ? The , uh ... your halo ? - Here , in my hand . - Mm . - So you 're saying multi-faced ... - Melanie ? David ? David ! Melanie ! Ah , ah . No ! Ah ! Oh ! - Shh . Okay , ooh . You 're okay . You 're just in a coffin . It 's no big deal . It 's not even a ... It 's more of a mental ... It 's ... it 's a mental coffin . Your body isn 't ... this is your mind that 's trapped . Which is ... that 's not better . - David . - Ah , ohh ! - You 're freaking out . Stop it . - Whoa ! Oh , no , you 're not ... oh , don 't tell me you 're trapped in here with another thing ... Monster ... whatever it is . - Hm ? - No , he 's up there . The monster . He tricked us into giving up control . - Tricked you . - What ? Yeah , I ... I got that part of me . But if you 're not the monster , then ... - I 'm you . Your rational mind . You 're having a breakdown ... A stress response . Your power is kicking in to save you . It created me . You did . - Wha ... ah ... - And you 're British ? - Like I said , I 'm your rational mind . - And I created you ? - Yes . Before this thing takes control of our body forever . - Okay . Well , hah ... Look around , pal . We 're in a locked coffin , underground . - Right . - There is no way out . - Tell me , how can we be underground when we 're not even inside our body ? So if there 's no body and no ground , then there 's no coffin . It 's just an idea . - That makes sense . - Good . Now , I want you to imagine a classroom . - What ? - A classroom . - With a blackboard . We 're gonna figure this thing out , you and me . Once and for all . Good . Nice blackboards . Now , I want you to forget all the tricks . The memory work , the MRI ... Forget all the lies . It 's your mind . You know everything the monster knows . So go back to the beginning . What have we learned ? - I 'm adopted . - Good . Write it on the board . - Really ? - Yeah . You imagined chalk , right ? Well , go on . - Which ... why didn 't they ... - My parents were ... I don 't even know what to call them now , but ... Why didn 't they tell me ? Or Amy ? Why ... why didn 't she ... Hey , focus . This is about facts . Fact one : You 're adopted . What 's fact two ? What did Lenny say about your father ? Your real father . - She said she knew him . - Yes . And before we go further , let me ask you this : Do you think that thing up there is Lenny ? - No . - So what is it ? - Uh , what 'd he say ? - The scientist ... uhh , a parasite ? - Yes . - Write it down . It 's not an insect , right ? Not a botfly or a tapeworm . It 's , a ... - yes , of course . It 's a mutant . Like me . - And has been with you a long time . Maybe since you were a ... - a baby . So , okay . I had a dad . And a mom , I guess , right ? And if Lenny knew him , then he was probably a mutant , like me . Psychic , I 'm guessing . And he ... this thing ... The monster ... Was his enemy . And they must have fought . - Did they fight with their fists ? - Uh ... no . - They fought here . In the astral plane . With their minds . And my father ... God , this is so weird . I don 't even know how to picture him . Um , screw it , okay . My father , he must have won . And the monster , or whatever , somehow his mind or his soul or his being or whatever was ... It didn 't die . But its mind floated off . And dad goes home . " Sweetheart , it 's over . I won . Give me some sugar . " - Is that ... Is that supposed to be a British accent ? - And there 's me . I 'm born . And he ... they ... somehow , they decided to give me away , right ? I mean , did they know ? Or maybe it wasn 't ... Maybe it wasn 't about the monster . Maybe they just didn 't want me . - Oh , boohoo . - Come on , focus . - Right . - You 're right . - I am pretty . I am loved . - Keep going . - Let 's say , for now , that dad was worried it wasn 't safe for me . So instead , to keep me safe , I went to live with my other mom and dad ... My adopted ... In secret . Somehow , the monster was watching and it found me . Like a haunted house , - he possessed me . - Why ? - Revenge . Isn 't that what she ... what it said ? - Good . Keep going . - It ... it possessed me . And that made me sick . My powers didn 't help ... Hearing voices and seeing ... That this thing made it worse . And he ... it ... poisoned me , my whole life . It made me ... it made me crazy . And it fed on me . - To what end ? - Power . It was weak , but I made it stronger . My powers . And it kept feeding . Uh , what did Lenny say ? The only being that matters in the universe is god . So it fed on me so that one day , maybe , it could get its revenge . Of course . But then Syd came . And she woke me up . The monster realized it couldn 't hide anymore . And it ... And here we are . I mean , not here , in this classroom , but ... Where are we again ? - Our mind is in the astral plane . Our body is in our room from when we were kids , with our friends . - And they 're in trouble . - Melanie was wrong . I was sick . But I 'm not sick anymore . - So what are you gonna do about it ? - I 'm gonna get my mind back . - Melanie . David ? - Oh . - No , no . Where was I ? Oh , yes . Here we go . - Ah ! - David . David . - Kerry . - You okay ? You ? It 's gone . - No ! It 's not gone . We 've isolated it in your mind . The monster with the device . - So leave it on ? - Yes , please . - You okay ? - Yeah . - David , we should ... I really think we should go to my lab . Tell him , Melanie . Elevator going down . - How do you feel about beat poetry ? Deliver my sermon to my soul . And Jack 's soul , too . And anyone who 'll listen . Jack made a mean Martini . I knew a guy called Jack . Would you like some eggs ? How about tomato ? To look at the sunset over the box house hills and cry . Is that right ? Oh , yes . Where was I ? You were never another locomotive sunflower . You were a sunflower . - I know you 're not a fan of mealtime . Did you wanna ... - I 'm good . - All right . - Did you want something ? There 's soup . - You left me . I needed you and you left me . Malfunction detected . Hot water levels at 13 % . Malfunction detected . Hot water levels at 13 % . Malfunction detected . Hot water levels at 13 % . - I 'm so ... - No . - Sorry . - No . Not here . I should 've told you about the man - and being adopted ... - the man ? - They are so ... But I mean , now I know you weren 't sick . And you had this thing inside of you . And the powers . David , you have powers . - I know . I 'm a mutant . - Mutant . But no ... I should 've ... you should 've come to live with me . With Ben , with ... oh , my god . - I have to call Ben . - Amy . - No . He 'll be so worried . - Amy , you can 't . They 're watching him , division three . - If you call him ... - an email , a ... - David . - I could call from a pay phone . - Just get some rest . We 'll figure this out . - Careful . Don 't ... don 't let it move around too much . I don 't know how stable the connection is . - Everything okay ? - Not really . I think we should get this thing out of me fast . I don 't think it 's too happy . - Did I ever tell you a story about the lady and the crane ? - Many times . Tell me again . - David . - You look well . Love that headband . I know . Me , not so much . Third degree , thank you very much . Really painful . We have so much to talk about . You can kill the others .

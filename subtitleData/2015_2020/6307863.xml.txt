 First we made contact ... and then we made war . We came for the resources and drove out the alien horde . 170 millon human lives were lost in that war against the Greysskins . But then , the ore ran out . ICP withdrew their security forces from Sector Nine . Now , it 's a galactic slum , full of stranded and starving refugees . They can choose to die up slowly Or try to escape and risk termination by ICP . They left us all wide open . And the Greyskins will be back and we 're only human . Daily prescribe dose ready . Daily prescribe dose canceled . Mr. Ashbrook . I wanted to let you know that I 've reviewed your application for the position of Sector Nine relief worker and I have to admit most of our workers are experienced travellers with an appropriate education . Perhaps you 'd like to reapply in future when you 've gained a little more life experience but I 'm afraid at this point your application has been unsuccessful I wish you all the best .

Taking your prescribes ? Yeah . Any traffic ? Couple of haulers . Cleared off a while ago . other than that we 're lonelier than a fat girl at the swinger 's party . displaced Niners are now facing the very real prospect of having to leave the sector to seek solace elsewhere .

Hocking narcs on the prom . You scan him ? Dante Rodriguez . He check out . Human part of him anyway . They 're my meds , man . Mmm , self-prescribed I 'm assuming ? Up you get . That 's some impressive hardware . I bet half of that is contraband . Won 't be much of him left when we start confiscating pieces . This some kind of ship manifest ? It 's nothing . Punch it through every nav code you have in the system We might be able to pull up some vessels carrying this precious cargo , yes Dante ? And take him to the brig . Why do you make it sound like we 're living in a prison ? It IS a prison . Especially for Jonah . I mean , at his age he should be out there exploring finding himself like you did . Yeah , I know . All I found was war . ... Niner refugees struggle to even feed themselves on poverty-stricken worlds You found a family , didn 't you ? There is still no official asylum seeker status for Niners , and it doesn 't look like there will be anytime soon . two decades after ICP peacekeeping forces withdrew from Sector Nine , The Interstellar Confederation of Planets continues to deny that there is a problem here . The fourth consecutive night just indiscriminate rioting here on Eora ... We 're safe here . Yeah . We are . Hey , look who I found . You good ? Yeah . Good girl . What happened on the prom ? Another punk selling narcs . Well , I keep telling ICP we need more men . That 'd be nice . Yes , it would . Good job . Well , I 'm going to get ready , before I get into more trouble . If the Greyskins are in fact returning these crippled Sec Nine colonies will be no match for the shifter onslaught . Screen mute . Ever seen a shifter , Jonah ? No . Only in sims . What do they look like ? Well , they can look like anything . They could look like me . Grrr ! Ever been to Sector Nine ? No . Where have you been ? Maya ...

Docking sequence complete . Let 's move . Clear . Clear . Search mode . Scan for life forms . Receiving initial ROVAR feed . Looks pretty dead in there . ROVARS are picking up zero activity .

One of the crew or mate more than one ... * cuts off * Power goes down for a few minutes and the crew starts shooting at each other . Every man for himself . We 'll examine the bodies . Find out what happened ... That 's not an option . It 's ICP 's problem now . It 'll take them weeks to get out here . These bodies will rot by then . Run the investigation . File the report , then we blast it . Okay . Jonah ... You 're taking your prescribes , right ? yeah Good . I need you focussed . It 's a good time for you to step up . I 'm focussed . ♪ screaming ♪ Jackson ! Don 't ! STOP ! Get off him now before I blow you away . You can 't kill us all . What ? We 're done hiding . Kai . Restrain these two . Koen . We have a situation down here . What 's the order ? The unregistered vessel is to be pre-rigged with explosives and jettisoned effective immediately . With them on board ? Your spirit is restless . She thinks I 'm a Niner . What ? That girl she thinks I 'm one of them . What are you going to do with us ? You 'll have your freedom soon . Dimi is a good man . He 's doing what he has to for us to survive . We saved them from an agonising death at the hands of smugglers . And in return they 've agreed to protect us . Now we have a common enemy . And together we will find a place to be whole again . What have you done with my men ? You have five minutes before I start executing your men . Maybe I 'll start with your son .

 edelweiss * * Small and white * * Clean and bright * may you bloom and grow * * Bloom and grow forever * edelweiss * * Bless my homeland forever * What was that ? A nightmare . With me in it . How is that possible ? I don 't know . Frank . There was another man kneeling near you in the film . Did you recognize him ? What ? No . Why ? He looked familiar to me . Bad news . I didn 't find a way out . What is it ? Something happen ? Everything 's fine . so give me the film . No . No . Stop it . Stop . You Nazi fuck ! Tell me it isn 't true . Tell me it isn 't true . Please tell me it isn 't true . Helen : John ? I couldn 't sleep . he wouldn 't need to invite me hunting . John . but he enjoys the things that he does . Helen . I need you to promise me something . Mm-hmm . If for whatever reason I don 't make it back ... Don 't let that man near our children . [ Knock on door ] Enter . Sergeant . Part of the Empire . And it is our duty to sacrifice whatever is necessary to protect it . sir . Karen : You don 't ever watch the films . - No exceptions . - It doesn 't matter to us what you saw . I just saw myself being executed by Joe Blake . And the whole city destroyed by an A bomb . and now you 're asking us to get you out ? Frank 's wanted by the Kempeitai . And neither of you thought to mention that ? Will you help us or not ? Major Karl Muller of the Reich ? Kempeitai Chief Inspector Kido . Please come in . Chief Inspector . This belongs to you ? Inspector . And I 'm prepared to make a full confession . Okay . We can get you out . But it 's going to cost you . We don 't have anything left . What do you want ? Your help getting that film back from Joe Blake and killing him . and I 'm cleared to put you on a boat to Mexico . I gave everything I had to save the son of a bitch . Wait . Because of what 's on the film ? Because he 's a goddamn Nazi . You said he didn 't deny it . that film and all of our names go to Nazi High Command . Fuck . Juliana . You 're the only one who stands a chance of getting close enough to him to do it and grab the film . Lemuel : You 're the only one he trusts . You want to kill him ? but leave her out of it . you did it before . The Nazi agent back in Canon City . That was self-defense . to assassinate him . Ah ... No . I can 't do that . I won 't do that . Frank : I know . Uh ... I 'll do it . Fish to the lure . You get him someplace where I can get a nice clean decent shot . I 'll do the rest . my God . Go through his desk . Anything official must be destroyed . sir . Sergeant . What is this man 's crime ? The shooting of the Crown Prince . Hai . But we 've been pursuing Frank Frink . The witness said Frank never discharged his weapon . Then why not arrest and interrogate this man ? Because that is exactly what the Nazis would want us to do . There 'd be war . A war that currently our Empire cannot win . Sergeant . But if Frink is gone and we cannot report the capture how can Tokyo be satisfied ? Whatever sacrifice is necessary . and I shall carry it . Yours is to remain silent and to act as my Kaishakunin . Yoshida-san ? Hai . The desk . Oberstgruppenfuhrer . Sieg heil . John . my aid . John . thank you . I prefer to use my own . Juliana . so the Embassy is the only place he can go now . ask for the visa office . It 's on the eighth floor . and that gives you access to all levels . Somebody will tell me if you managed to contact Obergruppenfuhrer Smith . Mr. Blake . He 'll probably be in one of the ad men offices ... Levels 4 to 6 . but you have to get him out . You 'll need a story . He 'll be suspicious . I 'll come up with something . rid ourselves of the suspicion that seems to have developed between us . We can speak candidly here . Nobody can hear us or reach us . I assumed that was the point . John . You believe Captain Connolly had a hand in the ambush on your car ? sadly we can only speculate . You must at least suspect I gave the order . It 's understandable . strong precedent for senior figures removing comrades in pursuit of the greater good . But sometimes such figures underestimate their comrades . I would hate to make that mistake . The world will change forever today . It 's too late for us to do anything about that . Now it 's simply a question of whether you are part of the future or the past . [ Phone ringing ] Mr. Blake . Ambassador Hugo Reiss . This is Oberfuhrer Diels . - Heil Hitler . - Heil Hitler . My staff booked you on the first rocket back to New York . You leave in a few hours . Make yourself comfortable in here until then . sir . Mr. Blake ? that 's correct . Have you spoken to him ? We 're still trying to reach him . So your mission here was a success ? I can 't really talk about that . Of course . Trade Minister . Juliana Crain . Miss Crain is not in the office today . I am aware of that . Nor will she be ever again . the man wanted in connection with the shooting of the Crown Prince . I 'm sure there must be some mistake . along with warnings unheeded . Trade Minister . I can do nothing about the loss of face you will suffer in connection with this as and when Mr. Frink is inevitably apprehended . But this time there can be no mitigation . This time ? Did you really think I did not know who helped the Nazi Wegener to leave ? I also knew why you did so . do not imagine I remained silent for any other reason than your own : the security of the Empire . Why are you telling me now ? Because there comes a time when all men must bear the weight Trade Minister . And our day has come . Goodbye . Chief Inspector Kido . Arigato . Papa . Klaudia . Mm . Otto . Good luck . It 's going to be okay . In a few hours we 'll be free of all this . Running away isn 't the same as being free . I want you to promise me . you get on that boat . don 't even think that . Think about what 's on the other side . and he is . I got on that bus with Trudy 's film because I thought it meant hope for the future . But this new one means that everything I 've done and everything I 've caused has been for nothing . There is no hope . There 's no future . But we have to go on . What else is there ? Okay . Let 's go . Ed . What are you doing in here ? Uh ... sir . I thought I 'd melt it before production tallies were recorded . You 're too much of a damn perfectionist . This barrel 's been bored out . - Sir ... - Tell me this is not what the Kempeitai are looking for . Trade Minister . Trade Minister . The only way ... Kotomichi ... to see ... every action . But still ... unable to steer our destiny . That is why you consult the I ching ... to glimpse what lies ahead . Kotomichi . No . You are a good man . Perhaps too good for this world . Trade Minister . You must not give up on meditation and not on searching . You must not ... what 's the matter ? The mine owners and General Hata are waiting for you in Bara . Cancel it . I 'll be leaving for the day . [ Phone rings ] Sir . Ambassador Reiss . No . He 's not here at the moment . This is Major Klemm . Where the hell have you been ? Here . I 've been here like I was told . They didn 't call you ? No . I called the ambassador to find out if he 'd heard from you . Mr. Blake . Obergruppenfuhrer Smith has left word . Diels reports directly to Heydrich . You are to stay away from Diels at all costs . Oberfuhrer Diels . Please come with me . I need a team to the Embassy immediately . sir . The car to take you to the airport Mr. Blake . Have you heard from Obergruppenfuhrer Smith ? yes . He 's expecting you . Please come with me . What news on Joe Blake 's mission in the Pacific States ? I take it you sent him to retrieve one of the films the Fuhrer finds so interesting . I 'm sorry . I can 't discuss that . John . Good luck . Mr. Blake . I can 't leave by the front entrance ? Your safety is of paramount concern to us . Please . Of course . I 'm just here for a visa application . Visa application . Ja . You can pass . Danke schoen . Mr. Blake . Joe . What the hell are you doing here ? How did you get in here ? You 're not the only one who can lie . Wait . Not that way . What the hell were you doing there ? You lying son of a bitch ! I had to know if it was true . Bullshit . You came for the film . - That 's all you care about . - That is not true . - Then why ? - The Resistance sent me to lure you out so they can kill you . And you 'd do that ? I 've seen who you really are . What are you talking about ? Joe . You 're in it . and you 're executing people . it wasn 't me . That 's not who I am . You want to know how I know ? Guess what I saw on the film I took to Canon City . You said you never watched the film . I didn 't tell you because you were so full of hope . right ? mine wasn 't newsreel . It was Soviet propaganda for Josef Stalin from 1954 . Stalin was executed ... exactly . So whatever you saw is no more real than Stalin coming back from the dead . You know what is real ? I 'm a dead man . And the man I report to won 't just kill me . and people you 're close to . and I 'll keep all those names he doesn 't know out of it . I swear to you . Mr. McCarthy ? sir . You converted it ? That 's right . And you tried to destroy it because ... Possession of a firearm is a very serious offense . But not as serious as attempting to assassinate the Crown Prince of Japan . This distinctive weapon was described by several witnesses . We know at least two bullets were fired from this gun . We are continuing to pursue Mr. Frank Frink that changes everything . Do you know where Frank is ? That is not relevant to the truth . The only relevant question is did you use this gun to shoot the Crown Prince ? What is the power of the films ? Do you know why the Fuhrer prizes them so highly ? You 'd have to address any questions on that subject to the Fuhrer himself . John . We both know that . I don 't believe for a second that sharing the land of your birth with the Japanese sits well with you . I 'm sure the Fuhrer has his reasons . John . dignified by the weak to justify their weakness . It 's certainly not worthy of you . Neither is betrayal . we owe our hearts and our minds and that idea is under threat . It is up to the best of us to step forward now as both the Fuhrer and nature demands . The strong must overcome the weak . the telephone is going to ring . Who will be calling ? I suspect you already worked that out on our walk . Nein ! The American Reich is vital to our interests . and I would be willing to hear what you would want for yourself . I need to be sure I can call on the same level of commitment as the Fuhrer . I have to hear your decision before I receive the call . Okay . Yeah . I understand . Was that Lem ? No . We got to go . At least there should be fewer Kempeitai around . Why ? They caught the guy who shot the Crown Prince . - Who ? - I don 't know . Some guy who works in a gun factory . Frank . We 've got to move . I got to make a call . No . We don 't have time for that . it 's Frank . Is Ed there ? You selfish piece of shit . They 'll kill him . You know that . And all because of you . - Go without me . - What happened ? Get Juliana away . Sieg heil ! John ? Rudolph will never get a weapon close enough to Fuhrer to kill him . Our leader 's paranoia at least has one advantage . He hides weapons everywhere . Reinhardt . I need to know you 're not alone in this . John . I am not alone in this . are you with me ? Reinhardt . Mein Fuhrer . There it is . I really appreciate you doing this . sending you to Mexico ? believing in me . Not many people have ever done that . Come on . She did it . " Do you hear me ? She fucking did it . " Atta girl . They 're on their way to you . She should take him through that door any moment . Copy that . I guess it 's too late to ask you to go with me . Joe . Wow . You 're good . Sniper ? No . too . For everything . You said once to me that I might be a different man if I 'd met you sooner . Please . I am . You changed me . That 's why I 'm not the guy in this film . I 'm still glad I met you . God . I don 't believe the film . I don 't believe it . I believe you . Hey . No . No ! No ! Ed ! no ! No ! I 'm here ! I 'm here ! Where the fuck are they ? " They should be with you . " Shit . Get out there ! damn it . What have you done ? sensei ! Sports announcer on radio : " And it 's 1-nothing . " Man : " Hot dogs ! Fresh buttered popcorn ! " " Get your hot dogs right here . We got candied apples " " and caramel apples . " Sports announcer : " San Francisco is ... " please . here you go . " And there goes the runner . " " And the windup . Here 's the pitch on the way . " " That 's a good fast ball . " " And there goes the runner ! " " A bouncing ball . Second base is going to field it . " [ " Twist " by Chubby Checker ] * Yeah * get around * * Dance all around * get around * * Yeah * get around * * Twist so nice * get around * * Twist *

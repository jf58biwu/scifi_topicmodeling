 Abraham : For centuries , mankind has been the dominant species . We 've domesticated animals , locked them up , Killed them for sport . But a series of recent events seem to suggest All across the globe animals have decided : " no more . " And so we were hired , A team of people from different backgrounds , With different specialities : An expert in animal behavior , A journalist , Safari guide , Foreign intelligence agent , And a veterinary pathologist . Our task : To find out what is happening with the animals , Why it 's happening , And how to stop it . Previously on zoo ... The plan on the table is to drop a version of endrin on the bats . Endrin ? You do realize you 'd be Risking the health of every single living thing in rio . Over here . That 's not evan lee hartley . So where is he ? The guy underlined every reference to animals In the bible . I mean , every single one . I also found this . Chloe : That 's evan lee hartley . Jamie : Who 's that standing next to him ? That 's my father . Think i almost got it . I can 't even begin to understand What 's happening right now . Do not . You 're making a mistake . Leo : The mother cell is in every single product Reiden makes . It 's everywhere . It 's all over the world , And it can 't be stopped . Listen to me . N-no , nobody is tricking you . Where is it ? Chloe : Please , i can explain . An intelligence agent tries to bug my cell antenna , The explanation is obvious : Interpol . Chloe : We have no interest in your business . We needed your antenna to get rid of the bats . Mitch : She 's telling you the truth . Says the american from the dea . I 'm a veterinary pathologist . You don 't believe me ? Well , i got the presidential award from the acvp , A swell group of geniuses . You want to hear me talk about Experimental mycoplasmosis in alligators ? How about gallbladder adenocarcinoma In african lions ? I 'm not a dea agent . Only thing i know about the drug war is that ... Drugs won . So , good for you . ( indistinct chatter ) I need to speak to gabriela machado . Now . Senhorita machado . Mr. Kenyatta . We 're about to drop the endrin , the chemical To get rid of the bats . Now , i know chloe wanted me to delay , But everything is falling apart ... That 's not why i 'm here . Chloe and another colleague of mine Have been taken by a man named silva . Silva ? Yes , do you know him ? Gustavo silva . He controls half the favelas . Drugs , weapons ... I need your help . We have power outages in most of the city . Lootings , fires ... Please . I have dealt with men like silva before . I know this does not end well . Sargento . Gustavo silva- - He 's taken a french dgse agent , chloe tousignant . And an american . Dr. Mitchell morgan . Where 'd you last see them ? At the complexo do alemao . Please , we need to find them . I 'll send a squad . The bats must have hit our transformer . Excuse me . He 's not even going to pass it on , is he ? I 'm sorry . I will do what i can , but ... ( plane buzzing past ) They 're dropping the endrin . According to the scientists , It should work almost immediately . Is that what it 's supposed to do ? Mm . Mm-mm . Shafer : Fbi . Give us a minute . Hey . You okay ? No , i 'm not okay . I lost it . You lost what ? Leo and i were driving back . He had the mother cell out in the woods somewhere . It took forever , but ... He was telling me about the boat he was gonna buy . And , uh ... Something just rammed into us . The last thing i remember seeing Is evan lee hartley 's face . Whoa ... Are you sure it was him ? He took it . He took the mother cell . Okay . We 'll deal with it . It 's gonna be all right . On what planet is it gonna be all right ? I 'm gonna call this in to the marshal 's office . It 's not your fault . All right ? You 're-you 're okay . That 's the most important thing . No , it 's not , jackson . Evan lee has the mother cell . And we have no idea what he 's gonna do with it . ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ If you are who you say you are , Explain this to me . So , until yesterday , the mice Would run when people came in through the door . Well ... That , mr . Silva , is a clear sign That things are working their way down the food chain . Is that the best that you can do , Mr. Veterinary pathologist ? The bats have developed some kind of biological imperative To attack technology . That 's why they were going after the transformers . But they still have to eat , And what they eat is street mice . So these little guys- - they probably think They 're better off with us Than with the bats . Mitch . The endrin 's not working . It 's just getting worse . Please , we need to speak to the authorities . So you can help the rich people downtown ? In complexo do alemao , I am the authority . I collect the garbage , provide the power , cell service . If there 's a problem , I take care of it . Well , that 's great . But we 're trying to help you with this problem . Getting rid of the bats is what we were attempting to do Before you kidnapped us . Oh . We may be able to draw them away If we can take your antenna . I lose cell service , It costs me 200,000 reais a day . Are you gonna make that up to me ? Well , do you want us to do something or not ? The antenna is not an acceptable option . ( speaks portuguese ) ( door locks ) What did he say ? If we don 't find an answer , he 'll kill us . ( woman speaking french over phone message ) ( message ends ) ( screaming ) It 's silva- - he 's coming . ( screams ) If we don 't find a way to get rid of the bats , He 's gonna kill us . Well , whose fault is that ? Genius idea , trying to steal Don corleone 's antenna . We should have insulted his mother while we were at it . Well , you have a solution for me ? Look , we can 't do anything about the bats . Because we don 't have any supplies . But if we did , We could build an electromagnetic pulse . What kind of supplies ? Um ... An old pc , Some copper wire , Um , a speaker , And a-a steel rod or pole- - About six , seven feet , maybe- - and a couple of batteries . Big ones . Like out of a car . And ... And a soldering iron . Do you want us to fix this or not ? Flavio will get you your supplies . And then he will watch you . Good . Maybe he 'll learn something . You should keep him on a tighter leash , Your veterinário . ( lock clicks ) What the hell were you thinking ? We stay alive long enough for abraham to find us . All i remember were his eyes . I couldn 't stop staring at them because they were so strange . Come on , jamie . Something . Which direction he went in , What he was wearing , something . I 'm trying , okay ? Yeah . ( clears throat ) ( sighs ) ( clears throat ) Uh , sweet teas . Three of ' em . Six bucks even . Great . Hey . Hey , do you have a recent photo of evan lee ? Just on the fugitive notification . Yeah . Look at his eyes . They appear normal . And then here , his pupil is blown . Sometime after meeting my father , Evan lee suffered the same mutation as those animals . You 're telling me this is the reason he attacked those hunters ? I don 't know . Maybe . He was wearing a light-colored shirt . I remember because everything else was so dark . You didn 't mention that before . You know , jamie , There 's a chance i can help you remember if , uh ... If you 're willing to try . ( lock clicks ) Oh . Welcome . ( chuckles ) Usually folks make an appointment , but ... I think i can squeeze you in . Appreciate that . How can i help you ? I want you to do something for me . ( chuckles ) i 'm afraid i don 't understand . You will . Shafer : Now , i want you to relax . And breathe . ( exhales ) You 've been in an accident . ( tires screech ) But you 're okay . Now , what do you see ? I was hanging , because we were upside-down . And , um ... And the steering wheel was kind of bent towards me . Then you hit your head on the passenger window . That , um ... That must have hurt . Yeah . And my chest . Uh , uh , from the seat belt . It-it hurt to breathe . What else do you remember ? Um ... The-the ... Side mirror was broken . It was kind of just hanging . And then evan lee crouched down . Evan lee : Where is it ? He reached across me In the car , And he took the mother cell . And he walked around the front Of the car . And the windshield was-was cracked . And then i-i looked over and i saw leo . When you looked over at leo , Could you see evan lee through the window ? Yeah . He went and he-he got into his car . Car or truck ? When you saw evan lee leave , did he ... Sit down into his car or ... Step up into it ? ( door shuts , engine starts ) He stepped up . He stepped up . It-it was a truck . It was a big green truck . Good . And i was afraid he was gonna ram us again , but he didn 't . He just ... Pulled in front of us and drove away . Which means you would have seen the license plate . I 'm-i 'm not sure . It 's okay . Just ... Just try to remember . Those plates , jamie , they would ... Start with letters . Three letters . K ... Kll . Kll . Like " kill . " You did great . ( chuckles ) All right , i 'm gonna go run those plates . Hey . ( door opens ) ( door shuts ) We 're gonna find him . Yeah . Swinney : You understand that if you want A sample from that part of the optic nerve , I have to go four inches into your skull . That 's why i brought this . You 're absolutely certain ? The numbing drops , they ... They have more of a su ... Do it or i 'll kill you . ( growling ) ( grunting ) ( bear roars ) ( clattering ) ( snarls ) ( sniffing ) ( clattering ) ( roars ) ( panting ) ( snarling ) ( growling ) ( loud crashing ) ( bear growling ) ( indistinct chatter ) Everything to the warehouse . Rápido . ( grunting ) What did you do with my friends ? Nothing . Where are they ? Silva has them . Then take me to silva . Rápido . ( dance music playing ) Silva is not gonna wait much longer . I 'm doing the best i can . But this music is driving me nuts . Hey , buddy , Any chance we can get a little less lambada , A lot more quiet ? He doesn 't speak english . Two weeks ago , My idea of danger was ... Rush hour on the 405 . My sister does that- - Complains so no one sees how vulnerable she is . Maybe that 's because i 'm spending The last hours of my life building a $ 20 machine That 's not gonna do a damn thing . That $ 20 machine is the reason why you 're not dead already . We stay alive until abraham can find us . That 's a great idea , until silva pushes the button On this contraption and expects bats to come . What ? I 've been looking at this backwards . Instead of a carrot , we need a stick . A stick ? Instead of luring them away , we need to ... We need to chase them out . Back in vet school , i had a ... Very hot professor who had a thing for bats . Details not important . Or appropriate . Anyway , I spent a very memorable night listening to her theories , One of which was High-pitched frequencies repel bats . If this thing has a joystick control board Instead of an emp , i can ... I can ... I can build an oscillator . It 's a ... It 's a device That puts out a continual sound frequency . Well ... There it is . Flavio : Uma hora . One hour , mitch . Where is silva ? Where is your chefe ? You think i would take you to silva ? If you don 't take me now , I swear on my life , i will pull this trigger . I see your eyes , puxao . I know silva will kill me if i betray him . But you ? ( gun cocks ) I don 't think so . ( phone rings ) Answer . Dr. Swinney . Y-yes , miss mcclean , wh-what can i do for you ? The adjustable-focus reading glasses , uh ... No , no , no . Th-there 's no need to come in right away . Have you tried , uh , turning the knob on the side of the frame ? ( sighs ) still not working . Th-then we 'll have to set an appointment . Uh , but you have to believe me When i tell you , you can 't come here now . T-tomorrow at 9 : 00 ? Put it back in . Into what ? Abraham : This doesn 't have to happen . Please don 't make me do this . Drop it . ( gun fires ) Take me to silva . ( beeps ) Hey . Where you been ? Finding evan lee . Or at least trying . The fbi can 't , but you can . You know how many law enforcement officers There are in this country ? About a million . You know how many dog lovers there are ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . 85 million . Look . I posted this to every social media site And local app i could find . " looking for the man who killed my golden retriever " and drove off in a green pickup . " louisiana plates start with kll . Last seen : Mobile , alabama . " I 'm not waiting for the fbi to find evan lee hartley 's truck . That son of a bitch nearly killed me . You are one clever cookie . You find anything in leo 's ledger ? Yeah , the dates and locations Where reiden 's mother cell product were used are consistent With pretty much all the infected animals we 've seen . Louisiana , l.A. , Slovenia ... Brazil . What if there 's nothing we can do about it ? If there 's nothing that we can do about it , Then , uh , there 's nothing that anyone can do about it ... And my father was right , and the whole world goes to hell . ( cell phone chimes ) Oh , my god . Hmm ? Someone spotted evan lee . Hey , there 's shafer . Hey . Hey . Why didn 't you return my text ? Oh , sorry , there 's nothing to report yet . We haven 't found evan lee . We did . That 's it . That 's his truck . All right , i want the two of you to go back to the hotel . ( scoffs ) no , the answer 's no . Stay back . Both of you . Evan lee has every cop in the country after him . What would he be doing here in the middle of town ? He told his victim 's widow that he was looking for a cure . But in mobile ? We know that his eye changed . We also know that he worked for my father Who cut out the eyes of infected animals . Wait , you don 't think he 's gonna cut his eyes out , do you ? I don 't know , but i 'm sure gonna find out . ( strained grunting ) Swinney : Hold still . Hold on . I 'm almost done . ( screams ) Oh , my ... Oh , my ... Shafer : Hey ! Swinney : He made me do it . He made me do it ! Fbi . Back up . My name is jackson oz . Listen to me . You knew my father . Get away from me ! Why 'd you think this would cure you ? Why 'd you think this would cure you ? Did my father think it would cure the animals ? Your father ... Did this to me . He 's gone . Jamie : I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry , jackson . But-but we got it . This could be the answer . I got to call this into the field office . Go . Go ! I got this . Go ! ( bear grunts ) ( bear continues grunting ) ( bear growls ) ( screams ) If your machine doesn 't work , he 's gonna kill us . Full disclosure : I 'm not exactly hopeful That my awesome oscillator 's gonna do anything but fizzle . Why do you do that ? Because it 's the truth . It 's not the truth . It 's what you choose to believe Because it 's easier than having hope . You hide behind logic . You think emotions are for the weak . But it 's all a defense . Please don 't pretend that it 's not . You know , a long time ago , There was a point in time , i was ... I was kind of a big deal . But ego is like having a hot girlfriend . Lot of maintenance . I published a study that wasn 't fully cooked yet , And i got my ass kicked . So the truth is- - i 've been dead for three years . Today 's just gonna make it official . You 're not talking about your job . You 're talking about your daughter . Her name is clementine ; she 's ten years old . She was diagnosed three years ago . I read your file . I want to feel bad for you , but men who hide things ... They become ugly . Well , you 're good , aren 't you ? Wasn 't that bad at first . She just ... She got a little clumsy . But then ... She started having seizures . A lot of kids with her syndrome , They-they ... They lose their eyesight , And get ... Get different personalities , but not clem . Clem 's just dying . Why aren 't you with her ? 'cause baby mama married a ... Decent guy when she was two , And i just decided to let them have their family . Until she got sick ... And i started beating down the doors Of every research hospital in the country . Then her mom put a stop to that . 'cause it was , you know , too many doctors , too many tests . And all i was doing was-was robbing clem Of whatever life she was gonna have left . I 'm pretty much out of the picture now . She 's been through so much . Maybe she needs you . And maybe i 've waited too long to reach out . Now that she 's so sick , I don 't ... I don 't want her to think that ... I 'm just doing it out of pity , you know ? Out of pity . So That 's me . Secret dad . You know , There 's an expression in french that says " rien ne pese tant que un secret . " Nothing weighs more than a secret . I think you should talk to her . ( phone ringing ) Flavio : Ola . Sí . Silva . Sim . Okay . Fechado . It must have worked . ( snaps fingers ) If the machines your friend had built would work , It wouldn 't have come to this . If it had worked , You would have murdered them anyway . Our business is over . The man you are is not worth The man i would have to be to kill you . Don 't come back to rio . I tried to stop him , chefe . ( grunts ) ( coughs ) ( grunts ) ( high-pitched sound spooling higher ) ( sound oscillating ) ( dogs barking ) We need to find abraham . ( dogs barking , howling ) Why are the dogs howling ? ( barking , howling continue ) They 're reacting to the ultrasound frequency Of the oscillator . ( bats chirping ) It worked . I mean , i want to think it worked , anyway . ( barking continues ) Oh . ( laughs ) Um ... Hey . ( laughs ) hey . Uh , wh-where 's jackson ? Uh , he 's down in the coffee shop . Oh , what ? No , uh , no celebrating ? Uh , well , there are mitigating factors . Now , come on . You have the evidence to take down reiden , right ? Uh , i gu ... It seems like it . So unless i 'm missing something , It seems like your bad day turned out great . So , ask me ... You should be doing something about that . You 're just saying that because i 'm wearing a towel . ( laughs ) I 'm not gonna lie . You , uh , you are an excellent towel-wearer . Oh . Among your other very fine qualities . Really ? What would those be ? Well , if i 'm gonna list those , I should probably come in , 'cause it could take a while . Yeah . Uh ... Could you just give me a minute ? Yeah . All right . ( laughs ) ( laughs ) I 'll ... I 'll be here . ( door closes ) ( hair dryer whirring ) ( chloe speaking french over phone message ) Chloe , it 's-it 's me . We , um , we found him , so as soon as you get this ... News anchor : ... Live at the crime scene . Police refuse to comment , But the possibility of murder-suicide Has not been ruled out . ... Call me . Hey , excuse me . Excuse me . Can you ... Can you , uh , do me a favor and flip through The other local stations ? Quickly , please ? ... Next week in manila has canceled their trip Because of the mt . Hana volcano ... Help yourself . Authorities have yet to identify the body of one man , But the second is confirmed to be dr . Humbolt swinney . Apparently , the bodies were discovered When a customer noticed broken glass Outside of dr . Swinney 's door and called 911 . ( ringing ) Ooh . As long as i 'm buying , will you pour me a vodka ? You bet . Uh , jackson , hey . Now 's not really a good time . Jackson : Jamie , listen to me . Ben killed the optometrist . Okay ? He didn 't call it into the field office . He killed him . Wha ... Uh , i-i 'm with ben right now , actually . Um ... Maybe , uh ... Maybe we could all meet up later for dinner or ... You are a terrible liar . Look ... Jamie , i don 't want to hurt you . Just give me the mother cell . Now . You son of a bitch . ( grunts ) ( grunting ) ( grunting ) Reiden paid you off , didn 't they ? Get off him , you son of a bitch . ( laughs ) Look , i ... Just want to hear her voice , okay ? Justin : Mitch , you sure this is a good idea ? Just for a minute . Justin , please . It 's mitch . Hi . Hey . Um , i-i know i never do this , But , uh , i 'm just checking in . What 's new ? My dog henry got hit by a car , But he 's okay now . Well , i ... Maybe i should Come see him sometime soon , huh ?

It 's a very long story , huh ? I 'll tell you later . Jamie : Chloe ... What is it ? They call it the mother cell . What the hell is a mother cell ?

 Big jim : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , Forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons- - Rage ... Grief ... Fear . My god . ( people exclaiming ) Now , in order to survive , We must battle our most dangerous adversary ... The enemy within . Big jim : Who are you ? I 'm christine price , and this is my friend eva . Excuse me , i need some air . And you all know each other ? We all have something to contribute . I 'll set up an office here in this building . If anybody needs support , come find me . What are you doing ? You were snooping . Please tell me you have the camera . What 's wrong , Is it missing ? Flight calculations of the meteoroid . Therapist , my ass . Christine works for aktaion . You 're sleeping in the same motel as me , two doors down , But with her . Abby : Take it . It makes all the pain go away . Junior : It 's safe . I checked the plans . I 'm telling you : That column is load-bearing . You take that out , The whole place is gonna come crashing down . I waited up all night To talk to you while you were with her ! ( gasps ) That was amazing . Just everything felt so heightened . Like we were just ... Back in the other world ? What is that ? Oxytocin . Our bodies produce it naturally During sex . Only this is about a thousand times stronger . Can i count on you ? I need you to do everything i ask Without question . I know how to follow orders . Everything that i do- - That you and i do- - Will be for the good of the group . Everything ? ( both chuckle ) That 's it . ( whimpering ) what ? What 's wrong , boy ? Hey , what 's wrong ? What 's wrong , you got ... You got something in your paw , there ? Never seen you be so friendly to another creature . What 's his name ? I call him indy . You like that , don 't you , boy ? You sure this Footage is worth risking our lives for ? That aktaion guy had a gun to your back last night . Trust me , If what 's on that video doesn 't open your pretty boy 's eyes About christine , nothing will . Why is aktaion trying to kill you ? Because i got tired of being their guinea pig . But this is much bigger than that . Somebody 's infected all of chester 's mill . The town 's infected ? With what ? Whatever got into christine when she dug that damn egg up . When i show the town what it is , They 're gonna come to their senses And kick her ass out of chester 's mill . Aktaion must have followed me . Do you ever tell the truth ? How do i even know there was a camera in there ? Listen : You came out here to find me , Not the other way around . So you can either paddle the hell out of here right now Or you can shut up and help me get that camera back . I was hoping that was you . Thank you . So what 'd julia say , anyway ? To make you punch the door like that ? It doesn 't matter . Get it off your chest . You 'll feel better . Uh ... Yeah , she 's making herself ... Crazy with conspiracy theories . She-she thinks that you and christine Are lying about who you are . So tell me she 's wrong . Eva . Answer me . I can 't , i ... Why not ? Because i-i can 't . ( scoffs ) Look , i-i can 't be with someone Who 's not gonna talk with me . Hunter : Next . Step up , step up . Joe , Norrie . Bet you guys are hungry . What even is that ? It smells like burning hair . Cattle feed . Tastes better than it smells . I 'd prefer burning hair . Looks like a lot of work . Hunter : Bunch of us took shifts sorting , soaking , Grinding . We were up all night , But it would 've taken a week otherwise . It 's amazing what people can do When they work together . Hey , norrie , You don 't mind taking over For me , do you ? I need a break . Uh ... I promised joe i would help him do something this morning . Yeah , yeah , i asked her to give me a hand With some solar panels near my house . Town needs power , right ? Christine asked us to get electricity back up As soon as possible . Well , you can 't argue with christine . Morning . Morning . How are you ? Aside from this massive headache ... Much better . Thanks for doing everything That you did . You want to do everything again later ? ( sighs ) Sneaking out , are you ? Feeling the town hall pull . I got to check in . Make sure the place is still standing . Christine 's counting on me to lead the support group . Oh . Back in a few hours ? Yeah . You want to check out that secret stash of booze In the crawl space at town hall ? The dome 's energy supply is beginning to fail . When jim rennie destroyed the egg , He compromised our power source . One amethyst died this morning And a second one is losing power , Which is causing the amniotic fluid in the cavern to dry up . It 's only a matter of time Before the dome begins to calcify . If the kinship can 't come together , We will all suffocate . Barbie . Come on in , hon . Have a seat . Who the hell are you ? ( booming crash , breaking glass ) Man : Oh , my god ! Man 2 : The ceiling 's caved in ! Girl : Oh , my god ! Man : We need help ! ( indistinct clamoring ) Hey , hey , come here , get that end . ( groans ) All right ... Okay , all right , count of three , we 're gonna lift up . I want you To slide him out , all right ? One , Two , three ! ( grunting ) Pete : All right , dale . Put ' em down . Christine . This is your fault . ( groaning ) I want to finish this conversation . We will . We 've got more important things to deal with right now . You 'll need to inspect the ceiling , Patch up what you can so we can move people in tonight . Pete : Don 't listen to her . She doesn 't know her ass from her elbow . Me , i 've been a carpenter since high school . All right . So what do you think we should do ? Unless you rip out the rest of the ceiling ... You 're looking at another collapse . Actually , pete , i need you to clear the dust And debris from all the beds , Make sure the space is habitable for move-in tonight . Lady , you lost the right to tell me what to do When you let junior rennie take his toy hammer to that column . This is on you ! Barbie : All right , all right . Hey , hey ... We don 't need to make a scene , all right ? I want that man out of this building . I got this , christine . He 's a menace . I said i 've got this . Hey , man . Look , no hard feelings , all right ? It was just starting to get a little tense there . How about we do this : How about you walk me through What happened with that column And then we can figure out step two together . All right . All right . There you go . One more step . ( barks ) ( chuckles ) Gonna need more than a sling for that one , sucka . ( clicking tongue ) come here . ( panting ) Okay , indy ... Indy , stay . ( whines ) Stay . Good boy . Maybe we can survive this town hall weirdness . I 'll look after you if you look after me . I plan on doing that anyway . ( laughs softly ) Okay , so ... Repeat after me . I ... Joe mcalister ... Do solemnly swear to look out for norrie calvert-hill ... ( sighs ) all right . I ... Joe mcalister ... Do solemnly swear to look out for norrie calvert-hill To keep the freaks with glazed eyes away ... ( laughs ) : Oh , come on . Fine . Yeah , to keep the freaks with glazed eyes away And to kill her If she ever becomes One of them herself . I 'm not gonna let that happen . Okay ? ( exhales ) Screw you for ruining a perfect day . ( sighs deeply ) I love you . What did you just say ? Nothing . You just said that you love me . No , i didn 't . Yes , you did . ( laughs ) ¶ ¶ Where have you been ? What happened ? I knocked out a column . I didn 't know it was load-bearing . Christine backed me up . What the hell does she know about construction ? I said it was my fault . Look , there 's a lot of hurt people in there . Christine wants you to go in and help out . ( bell tolling ) Eva . Barbie is suspicious . What did you say to him ? I didn 't say anything . Remind me again why we 're lying to everyone . I 'm doing this for your own good ; you 're not ready . For what ? Know what ? Forget it . I 'm tired of lying . I want dale To know who i am . We had an agreement . Not anymore . ( sighs ) Okay , you 're right . Maybe it is time you know the truth . Let 's meet at the cavern this afternoon When things settle down around here . That 's where the answers are . Barbie : Look , she 's got her areas of expertise . I 'm telling you , christine 's pulling the wool over people 's eyes . I know a fobbit when i see one . Fobbit ? I haven 't heard anybody Use that term since afghanistan . Did you serve ? Yeah . Marines . Yeah ? You ? Yeah . Army . Was , uh , fifth group , special forces . ( exhales ) Worked my way up from combat engineer to eod . Got a chance to put my construction skills to use . Explosive ordinance disposal . Brave cat . Nothing decimates humanity Like a few wires and a cell phone . Had to be A tight operation . Dumb broad Like christine would 've gotten us killed inside a week . ( panting ) ( quietly ) : Oh , thank god . ( beep ) No . Alaska ? What the ... ? Put your hands up and move away from the computer . The other way . You can test my blood . Julia : I 'm not infected . I don 't have what you 're looking for . Put it down . I said put it down ! Where 's the camera , doc ? Marston : The file was damaged during download . Big jim : Prove it . Christine ( garbled ) : According to the dark flight calculations of the meteoroid And magnetometer readings ... That 's christine 's voice . Finding the egg . Where is it , mr . Rennie ? Let me tell you something About being a car salesman , doc . If you want something ... You got to be willing to trade . Do you want that egg ? You better give us some answers . What would you like to know ? What happened in alaska ? You know , i trusted the guys on those missions More than i 've ever trusted anyone before . You know , people on the outside , They don 't hold themselves to that same standard , you know ? No kidding . I come home from my third tour , I find my tramp of a wife banging an old buddy of mine . Oh , man , that 's just brutal . The crazy part is , In the alternate reality i had her back . Then i wake up in a cocoon , Realize she 's still out there banging my friend And i 'm stuck in here . With nothing . I wouldn 't sweat it . You 'll find your place . Not if the queen has anything to say about it . So i 'll back you up . Yeah ? Yeah . Christine 's done calling the shots around here . Have you been drinking ? I had a nip last night . So what ? ( sighs ) come here . ( sighs ) selfish decisions have an effect on the group . If you 'd been on time this morning , People wouldn 't have been standing around When the ceiling collapsed . The ceiling Didn 't collapse because i stayed in bed an extra hour . You 're the one who told junior to knock the column down . What happened to the sam i know , The one that i worked so hard to get back on track ? That wasn 't me . This is me . The town drunk . I won 't let you throw away Everything you worked so hard for . You can get me the information we need , And i can 't let you leave . That 's not up to you . Don 't you walk away from me . I 'm going back to abby . She accepts me For the piece of crap i am . 25 years ago , a team went on an archaeological exploration To alaska , and they discovered fragments Of what appeared to be an egg In a meteoric crater . Unbeknownst to the scientists , the shards ... Emitted electrical charges when touched . Further tests revealed Strong heat signatures and readings . Big jim : The geiger counter 's going berserk . Is it radioactive ? It was a different kind of energy From any we 'd ever encountered . Clean and nonradioactive . Can you imagine what humanity could achieve With an intact egg ? No more coal-fired power plants , No more nuclear facilities , no more pollution . Unfortunately , their excitement Was short-lived . The group unknowingly became infected When they touched those shards . Whatever was inside that egg Altered their behavior . Julia : They committed suicide ? Marston : When their leader walked off that roof , The assistants followed him . Why ? Autopsies Revealed bodies teeming with cells ... Never found In anyone on earth . Is that what the people of chester 's mill Are infected with ? We don 't know . Big jim : What happens if , um ... ( clears throat ) something happens to the egg here ? Whatever the leader does ... The group will follow . Which is why it is crucial For us to meet the person who first touched the egg . We know who the leader is . She worked for you . She 's the woman who was using that camera . We did hire an anthropologist named christine price To find the world 's first Intact egg . But she never returned the egg To aktaion , did she ? She and her research partner vanished that day . But now that we know That she 's alive , we 'd love the opportunity To ... Help her . There 's a treatment for this ? You 're a liar . It 's in the trial stages . It 's ... Too soon to call it a treatment , But if we catch the infection early enough , We believe that we have an opportunity to reverse it . And in the meantime , The other infected people- - Are they ... Safer without her there to lead them ? I can 't say . And we have no way Of knowing Exactly what they 'll do this time . We 'll lead you to her . Drop it ! ( gun chambers clicking ) Tell them to drop the weapons . Weapons down . We 're all friends here . You will lead the team To christine price While mr . Rennie and i Continue our conversation on the whereabouts of the egg . ( scoffs ) Hell i am . ( gun chambers clicking ) Very sorry , mr . Rennie , But you made a promise to me . Share information with me , And i share information with you . You give me the egg , I 'll show you the way out of the dome , and You will be as free as a bird . ( doorbell rings ) Expecting someone else ? Oh . ( door closes ) I can tell how much you love your daughter . What was her name again ? Uh , courtney . That 's right . I remember now . I met her in the alternate reality . Yeah . It felt so real . You know , i can still ... Feel her in my arms . But in real life , courtney isn 't healthy , Is she ? She 's outside the dome and was born With severe brain damage from your drinking . She 'll never talk , never read . Why did you lie to the group ? I don 't know . I just can 't imagine her the way that she is . What i did to her . So i just imagine something else , you know ? She 's out there with new parents , and They 're helping her and loving her , and ... The doctors are fixing her brain . 'cause i can 't live if i don 't think That she has a chance , so ... But she doesn 't . She never did ... Because you 're her mother . Sometimes it 's a relief to admit who you really are . I didn 't mean to hurt her . I love her . I know . I know you do . ( sniffling ) I know you do . But you destroy everything you love . ( crying ) I 'm speaking plainly to you , abby , Because i know how much you care about sam . I do . The world will never get to know who your daughter might 've been , But there 's still time to save sam . Okay . I know that you 'll make the right choice this time . ( sniffles ) ( indistinct chatter ) Hey , do me a favor . Go tell those guys there putting those beds together , Come in here , help us take the ceiling down . ( scoffs ) good luck with that . Christine told ' em to get The dorms ready for move-in tonight . Hey , i don 't care what she said . You tell them i said move-in can wait . Yeah . All right . What the hell ? It 's scored . ( indistinct chatter ) That was very wasteful . What ? This stuff ? ( loud mechanical humming ) We 're running out of time . Remember when you told me You thought something was growing inside you ? You were right . There is something growing . The egg put a life force inside you . You are changing , cell by cell , into A better version of yourself , A woman who will bear barbie 's child . But you have to protect him , eva . You have to be willing to do whatever it takes . The child you 'll have together will replace me . You 're crazy . ( panting ) ( gasps ) Junior . Let me go ! No ! ( groans ) No ! Junior : Come here . ( crying ) : No . No ! ( eva panting ) ( sighs ) This fluid is finite and precious . ( groans ) A gift i would only give To someone as important as you . ( groaning ) no ! Better now ? I 'm sorry i questioned you before . It seems so simple now . Who i need to be . And you remember what we talked about ? What you need to do for barbie ? I 'll do whatever it takes . Good girl . Now go get some rest . Why is that happening ? Christine : You and me ? We 're the same now . It 's not so easy for everyone . Some people need more help than others . And we can 't Give oxytocin to everyone . There 's not enough to go around . We need to guide the resistant . Starting with joe . I need the two of you to build something very important . Hunter said joe and norrie abandoned their work . Send hunter to find them and bring them to town hall . Have them wait there for me . Joe ! Norrie ! Hey . Christine wants you back At town hall pronto . We 're taking the day , hunter ! There 's no law against that , is there ? ( scoffs ) i have to come up and get you ? Yeah , come up here and check out the view . ( whispering ) : Are you kidding me ? Just ... ( sighs ) Yeah . So , uh , What do you think ? Look , you can actually see the old paper mill from here . You guys have to come back . You 're like ... Cattle . We have to work together . We live together , we work together . We moo together . If you want to eat cow food and be herded , Then that 's your choice , But this is a free country , and i 'm gonna do what i want . Norrie . Moo on . I 'm not going anywhere . Come on . Come on . Hey , get away from me ! Please . Norrie : Stop ! Get off me ! ( gasps ) Oh ! Hunter ! Joe : Hunter ! Hunter , are you okay ? ! Okay , come on , bring it to me . Christine : What are you doing ? Ripping all the beams out of the ceiling . There 's no patching this up . So pete was right . Where is he ? He 's taking a break . I 'm sorry . I should have just Handed the reins over to you and moved out of the way . I hope you know that i trust you 100 % . ( overlapping chatter ) So , this collapse . I don 't think it was an accident . I 'm not sure , But several of the beams are scored in different places . They 've been cut . Someone did this deliberately ? Why ? To prove he was right . Pete ? We can 't have this man in the group . You know what you need to do . What ? You need to take care of him . His actions Killed two people . Barbie ! Hunter fell off a roof . We need your help . Let 's go . I return with " repleshinments . " ( clears throat ) Replenishments . ( water dripping ) Abby ! ( water running ) Oh . Hey . Oh . ( crying ) ( sobbing ) Another pig was killed . Well , a piglet , actually , So there 's only enough for a few vips . We 'll make it our secret . I have to prioritize , Which doesn 't always sit well with the people Who think they 're getting the short end of the stick . I underestimated you , pete . You 're a man who listens to his instincts And does what he has to do to be heard . The problem is , is not everyone Respects your initiative . Barbie knows that you cut the beams In the ceiling , that you 're responsible for the deaths Of those two people . What ? Hey , i had nothing to do with that . Of course you did . And i understand why . But barbie doesn 't . And he 's going to kill you . I pleaded with him . I told him our group can 't operate like that . But his mind 's made up . I know that you 're not The real threat . Barbie is . Without him around , you 'd have everything you want : Women , power , status . He 's the enemy . The only thing holding you back . So what am i supposed to do ? You 're An instinctive man , pete . You do what feels right . ( indistinct chatter ) What are you doing in my office ? It 's not your office anymore . What has gotten into you ? You 're even more brash than usual . Well , if i were to scream , Everyone in this building would come and restrain you . Not when i tell everyone you 've been lying to them About being a therapist Or whatever you are . And i 'm gonna scream it From the center of town If you don 't get your ass in my car Right now . All right , we need to stabilize him . Joe , get his head . Norrie , get his feet . Where the hell 's sam ? ( gasping ) Hey , buddy . Hey . How you feeling ? What happened ? Joe : You fell off The roof . All right , hunter , do me ... Do me a favor here , all right ? Can you move your fingers ? That 's a good sign . All right , now your feet . Come on , hunter , i need you to move your feet . Barbie , i can 't feel my legs . I can 't feel my legs . Okay , listen , i 'm-i 'm gonna go get eva , okay ? She dealt with a lot of these injuries in the alternate reality . ( panting ) It 's gonna be okay . Hunter , what happened on the roof ? I asked norrie to come with me and she sat down . And when i tried to get her up , she pushed me . Norrie pushed me . That 's not what happened . She 's right . Hunter grabbed her wrist and she pulled away . I mean , he lost his balance . It was an accident . You 're responsible for this . There need to be consequences . No , no . It was an accident , like joe said . Junior , what 's wrong with you ? ( shuddering breaths ) ( whispering ) : Something 's wrong with these people . Come on . Go . This way . Okay . Go . Go ! Come on ! ( grunts ) Move ! ( grunts ) get out of the way ! Junior ! Junior ! Junior . ( panting ) help us . No one 's going anywhere until we talk to christine . Get out . It must be exhausting being the only soldier left In a war that 's already been lost . Get out . Start moving . Nothing 's been lost . You 're on your way to bird island , Where whatever 's in you that 's making you such a monster Will be removed . And if you survive , All of chester 's mill will get the same treatment Until this town goes back to the way that it was . ( chuckling ) : You actually mean to save humanity ? Oh , That 's just so sweet . ( handcuffs clicking ) unfortunately , it 's much too late for that . ( insects trilling ) Barbie : Eva ! Hey ! Eva ! Hunter fell off a roof . I think he 's paralyzed . I 'm gonna need a hand . Come on . Okay . ( grunts , panting ) ( high-pitched ringing ) ( panting ) ( grunting ) ( shouts ) i 'm the hero now , you hear me ? ! I 'm gonna take your place and your girl ! ( grunting ) ( shouts ) ( grunting ) ( choking , shouting ) ( grunts ) ( groaning ) ( coughing ) You will never have a girl like me . Want to know why ? Because you 're a piece Of trash who never learned how to be a man . ( shouts ) ( eva groaning ) ( grunting ) ( shouts ) ( panting ) ( bat clatters ) ( coughing ) I 'm here . I 'm here . Hey . ( panting ) I 'll do anything for you , dale . ( shuddering breaths ) ( both panting ) And i 'll do anything for you . ( radio static crackling ) Man : We 're almost there . Hey , hey . Door 's that way . Yes . But the way out of the dome is here . Wait ! Wait ! ( grunting ) hey ! Hey ! Hey ! What is this ? ! It 's a birdcage . Isn 't it extraordinary ? This island was once filled with ornithologists . This ... Is my favorite cage . But i 'm not infected . ( dog whimpering ) Indy ? ( whimpering ) what are you doing with my dog ? Hey . Hey . Indy . Hey , hey . It 's okay , boy . Hey . It 's okay , boy . Come here . You weren 't honest with me about the egg , mr . Rennie . The egg is not on bird island . ( whimpering ) Wait ! Wait ! I lied . It 's at town hall . Christine 's got it . You 've lost your chance . Martin , Take this animal into the next room And slaughter it . No , no ! Wait , wait ! Wait . ( panting ) All right . It 's smashed . I broke it . It 's broken . It 's smashed . Give me my dog back . Come here , boy . Come here , boy . Good boy . Come here . Come here , boy . Oh , good boy . Come here . Good boy . You 're a good boy . Good boy , good boy . Good boy . Why am i here ? Every proper study Must have an experiment And a control . Christine price is the experiment , And you , mr .

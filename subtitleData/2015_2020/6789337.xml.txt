 It has been 302 days since I last saw my wife , Debbie . - How 'd you get my car ? - The less you know , the better . You are resisting ! I 'm a political prisoner ! I 'm coming down there . I 'll take care of this . Kurt , let 's leave the Earth work to the Earth workers , all right ? - Walsh screwed this up . - Don 't get shot . Time to clean up this mess . - Hello . - Beacon Police Department . There might 've been a car accident . On Hawthorne Road . - Shit . - I swung by Hawthorne Road . Checked it out . There was ... there was one casualty . Jesus , what a mess . It was a ... it was a raccoon . Thank God . Yes , okay . Thank God . Seemed so much bigger than a raccoon . It was quite obese . Can I get your name , please ? So , what happened ? Looks like he beamed right onto Hawthorne Road . I took care of the body . - You 're positive he 's dead ? - He 's definitely dead . You 're gonna have to break it to them . - Can you do it ? - That 's way above my pay grade . Yeah , rent-a-cop asshole . So , you should probably ... I know . You might want to remove your skin suit . I 'm going like this . Yeah , so , Glimmer said he beamed right onto the road , but the car hit him right away . Anyway , I know you guys all spent a lot of time up here , so , sorry . Wait , I don 't understand . Kurt 's dead ? This is your fault . He was cleaning up your mess . I told you guys I had Ozzie under control , all right ? - Wow . - Here we go . You know , I mean ... I mean , guys ... Guys , I mean , Kurt 's not dead . He 's not dead . He 's not . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . No ! No ! No ! No ! No . No ! No ! Please , take me instead ! I just can 't feel anything anymore . Sorry , I was a mess there for a second . It usually doesn 't take me that long to process my emotions . Okay . Who wants tea ? Ozzie . Ozzie . Turn it around . You have to turn one around to make them join up . What exactly does a sponsor for an alien abduction support group do ? I mean , am I supposed to call you if I feel tempted to talk to aliens or something ? Basically if you wake up in the middle of the night and you need to talk to somebody , I 'm your guy . I 'll bring you a burrito or whatever . Why ? Do you have something ? Ozzie . I 'll save it till I need a burrito . So , does anybody have any ... anyone other ... Richard . You have something to share ? I do . Thank you . So , as you know , my wife was captured by the Reptilians , and needless to say , this has been quite an ordeal . I 've done everything possible to find her . A lesser man would 've been destroyed by this , but , I 'm much more resilient than I ever thought . Wherever she is , I hope she knows - that I 've not given up on her . - _ So , there haven 't really been any new developments here ? Gina , if you would let me finish , then you would know that you should let me finish . Because ... they made contact . I 'm looking for Richard Schultz . I 'm a representative of the Reptilian High Council and I have some news about his wife . Are you Richard Schultz ? Yes . You 've been served . Wow . It was a long time coming . That ' must 've been a hard message to receive , Richard . And an even harder message to decode . Took a while to crack the code , but I did it . So , first I counted all the words . That 's nothing . Then I circled all the odd or prime-numbered letters , which is total gibberish , clearly . - What did it say ? - Okay . " Richard . " Richard . " They totes have me . " Help . " Deeply , Debbie . " Richard , those are divorce papers . To the untrained eye . You 're not a trained therapist . - I know that . - I 'm not sure that you do . I would know if I was a trained therapist , Gina . Listen , I need you to go easy on Richard , okay ? He 's what we call ... - fragile . - I don 't think fragile 's a clinical term . And we let people work through things in their own time . Gina , the guy is struggling with something . Somebody needs to tell him the truth . Who 's truth ? Your truth ? My truth ? Richard 's truth is Richard 's , and he needs to come to that in his own time . I need you to do me a favor and pretty please , just don 't push him into a nervous breakdown . Ozzie . Well , well , well , look who finally decided to show up . Me ! - Hey , Gerry . Where were you ? - Where was I ? In jail for the last six days . And no one came to bail me out ? Well , I thought Kelly was gonna get you out . It was ... no , it was Chelsea . - Actually , it was ... - Hello ! Of course I have time to upgrade my cable service . That 's not even a phone . - Anything ? - You missed the meeting . And you ... you were my one phone call . I 'm sorry , Gerry . I ... I had kind of a weird night . Hey , Gina , it 's me , Gerry , from group . - I 'm scared . I 'm in jail and ... - This mailbox is full . - Whoa , what happened to your car ? - I-I-I hit a raccoon . That must 've been one fat-ass raccoon . - Yeah , it was . - How 'd you not see it ? - Wait a minute , you hit an animal ? - Yes . - Are you experiencing visions ? - God . Gerry , sometimes a car accident is just a car accident , okay ? Okay . Where 'd it happen ? Somewhere , um , out on Hawthorne Road . Hawthorne Road . Ehi , that was pretty intense in there . You 're telling me . So , what 's your next move ? Well , I 'm supposed to go in for some " mediation , " but clearly that 's a trap . You know , if you 're worried , I ... I could go with you . I just want to prepare you . We are about to go into the shit . The Reptilian den . Their nest . Really ? ' Cause it says we 're going to the offices of Mu√±oz , Sherman , and Lane . So , here 's how it might go down . Reptilians are very charming , so they might greet you warmly . If they offer you a beverage , don 't take it . I mean , actually do take it , but do not drink it . All right , thanks for the heads up . Jeff . You think we should have a funeral ? Why would we do that ? 'Cause Kurt was our friend and we lost him and we 'll miss him . You sound like an idiot right now . If Kurt was alive , he 'd agree . But you know what ? He 's dead . Here 's a guy who was here . Now he 's not . He was a co-worker , and now he 's a no-worker , like you , Don . Hey , Mom . Did ... did we ever go to Beacon when I was little ? No . Not that I remember . W-What about Dad ? Mayb ... maybe he took me ? God knows where he might 've taken you on one of his weekends . Did you know he took you to the bank for your birthday so he could get a free mug , that cheap mother ... O-Okay , great . Take care . I love you . - Are you all right ? - I 'm good . Really ? Ozzie , I can 't believe it 's come to this . We should never have gone on that camping trip . It started out good . We both liked spending time with each other . - Cheers . - Cheers . We were soul mates . Ooh ! Shooting star . Aah ! But then after we were taken , she was different . Sounds like you , really had something special . - Thank you . - Yeah . My God . There she is . She looks amazing for someone who 's been in captivity . They must 've given her highlights . But to what end ? Hey , Gerry . Say no to crack . What ? Your butt crack was showing . What are you doing out here ? Just investigating some inconsistencies . What am I looking at , Gerry ? It 's just a random piece of fresh blacktop . Hold on . Gina told me she hit a raccoon . So ? Gina hit a raccoon . So what ? Is this or is this not in the shape of a body ? How many different positions did you lay in before you figured that out ? A lot . What do you think ? Is this crazy ? Yeah , I mean , it 's crazy that they filled up this spot but totally ignored that pothole that 's been there for , like , over a year . - Shit . - Shit . My gosh . Counsel for Mr. Schultz , are you ready to proceed ? - Sidebar . - This is not a court of law . Did you tell them that I 'm your lawyer ? I-I-I ... All lawyers are Reptilians . My God . Please , I need you . I-I ... Please do not leave me here . - No . - Mr. Schultz . All right , let 's , law it up . Doesn 't make any sense . Why would they pave over a random stretch of road ? Okay , this is gonna sound a little left field , but I read on the Internet that Reptilians ' blood is acidic . Yeah , I bet that can corrode concrete . That 's genius . Gina didn 't hit a raccoon . She hit a Reptilian and it melted into the ground . And then they paved it to cover it up . You have a little something . No , right ... Here . I got to go to the post office because I have to ... test all of the pens . Totally . Thanks for the e-egg salad . It was righteous . - Just eat the rest of it . - Yeah . Okay , bye . I think you 'll find our terms very agreeable . I probably will because I 'm a lawyer . She 's being really generous . She 's giving you everything . Debbie . Debbie , please look at me . Blink twice if the Reptilians are making you do this . Richard , there aren 't any Reptilians . There 's one right there ! He looks so much like a reptile ! I 'm sitting here by myself begging you , - please sign the papers ! - No , you 're not ... no ! - No , Debbie . - Richard . Please . Thank you . Thank you . That was pretty tough what you did back there . - Yeah . - How do you feel about it ? Pretty good , actually . Well , it 's over . - My God . - You were great . Shit ! - God damn it ! - _ Scared ? Well ... yes , yes , I was scared . But at a certain point , you just have to face the facts . And , mad props to old Ozzie here , 'cause I never could 've done it without him there . Sorry , so you saw Debbie in person ? I did . And you got divorced ? You signed the papers ? Well , let 's just say that I left my mark . - " Suck Reptilian dicks , " Richard ? - Yeah . What did your Reptile lawyer think about that ? I knew that this stupid meeting was the only place where you could not ignore me . Would you please , please just sign the papers already ? Please ? Never ! Hi , Debbie . Welcome back . Welcome back ? Debbie used to be a member of ... of StarCrossed , - ... along with Richard . - Cut the shit , Gina , okay ? I cannot believe that you are still enabling this lunacy . And you ? You 're his lawyer . You should know better . I 'm not ... You 're the lawyer . Go fix it . What 's up , Yvonne ? Hey , Gerry . Nice weather we 're having . Yeah , we 're inside . Right . Perfect 72 . So , that was fun yesterday hanging out with you . Yeah . I had a nice time , too . Surprisingly . Too bad we hit a dead end . Yeah , well , here 's the thing . I went down to City Services . You did ? Yes , and I got in contact with Animal Control , and there wasn 't any record of a raccoon corpse removal for the past two weeks . - No . - Yes . Richard . Come on . Richard ! Hey , Debbie . You ... you seem really upset . I do ? Do I seem upse ... No , I 'm totally fine . I know why I 'm upset . Because I 'm still married . Can I help you ? You know , why don 't we talk somewhere a little more private ? I 'm not actually his lawyer . I 'm ... kind of a friend of Richard 's . - I 'm in the group . - Of course . Just another crazy person ... - ... enabling him . - No , no , no , no , no , no . I am the most sane person in that room . I have a master 's degree . Look , the only reason Richard went to mediation is because I talked him into it . I 'm trying to get him to face the truth . And ... it might help if I knew what actually happened on that camping trip . That was his idea . I hate the outdoors , which is something that Richard would know if he ever listened to me . He told me to pack for a romantic getaway . I thought we were going to Jamaica , not Fish Kill State Park . I mean , you know , at that point in our relationship , we could barely sustain a conversation , let alone go on a vacation together . Is that a shooting star ? I want a divorce . He makes it seem like , you know , everything was fine before we got abducted , - ... but we were unhappy ... - Wait , so you were abducted ? Aah ! You know , honestly , I don 't ... I don 't know . Maybe . Doesn 't matter . At some point , you have to make a choice . Do you want to chase the truth or do you want to be happy ? What if you can 't be happy without the truth ? You are never gonna know what happened to you . Stop torturing yourself . Move on . And help me move on , too . Hey , Richard . I always thought Debbie was ... - Debbie was kind of ... - A bitch . Yeah . Right . You know , they say that single 's the new married . I 've been married . It 's not . Richard , how are you feeling ? I don 't know why I denied it for so long . Debbie is not a prisoner of the Reptilians . Because she has been a Reptilian the whole time . Buddy . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Let 's hear him out . We 're here to listen . Thank you , Ozzie . Yes , I have a lot of clues , I have a lot of evidence , and it would be very healing for me to give it all to you right now ... um ... in order . So , on our wedding night , I noticed that her hands were very cold . Reptilians have bad circulation . Would you like to say a few words ? No . Just a few ? An employee has expired . And ... And ... It 's okay . Let it out . I want revenge ! Okay , all feelings are valid . I want to bathe in their blood ! They will feel what Kurt felt when I avenge his murder ! Good sharing . Did you , get it out of your system ? Can I have a moment alone with him ? Sure . Who did this to you ? Don 't get shot . Empathy . I will find you . Aah !

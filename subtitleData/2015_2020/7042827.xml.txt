And you just cover that breathing hole with a piece of tape . Pokes its head up for some air . Pull it out . Ecuador 1987 . Pulled that little guy out of my elbow . I don 't know if any of you are following the news . If you 're not , you should be . There 's something going around that 's making people sick . Most are now speculating that it 's parasitic , like this guy . Can anyone tell me what a parasite is ? Yes , Evan . Um , it 's , uh , an organism that lives in another organism . Or on another organism , like head lice . - Remember when you had head lice , Emma ? - ( CLASS LAUGHING ) I 'm sorry . - Anyway , look at this . Parasites , all right ? - ( STUDENTS GROAN ) These guys cannot survive on their own , okay ? They need a host . ( STUDENTS GROAN ) Sometimes they live peacefully inside their hosts , but sometimes ... this is what fascinates me , guys ... sometimes they take control , going so far as to manipulate their behavior . Toxoplasma gondii . This is a parasite that gets inside of a rat 's brain and makes the rat completely fearless around cats . Why ? Because Toxo only reproduces in a cat 's intestines . So the cat eats the rat , and the cycle then begins again . Is it like how zombies are always biting people to turn them into more zombies ? ( ALL CHUCKLING ) Know what ? It 's kind of . I mean , the question being ... when does a host stop being an animal ... - and simply become a vehicle ... - ( WHISPERING ) Gracie . Are you okay ? ... with about as much control as an airplane over a pilot . - This is always for the greater good . - Are you okay ? MICHAEL : It 's always in the name of reproduction , of proliferation . ( INAUDIBLE ) Now this parasite that we 're dealing with overseas is most likely single-cell .

( GASPS , COUGHS ) ( GASPING ) EMMA : Somebody help ! Help ! NURSE : Over here , straight . Open your mouth . Look up . Up . Great . And , Emma ... do you know if Gracie has been exposed to any livestock ? I don 't think so . Do you know if she 's come into contact with anyone who 's traveled internationally ? Her mom got back from San Francisco this weekend . Okay , and did Gracie mention anything about not feeling well ? Last night , she said that her throat hurt . This morning , when I saw her she looked pretty sick . Did she describe any other symptoms ? Yesterday she said she was really hungry but I didn 't think there was anything weird about that . NURSE : Okay . Did any of her discharge enter your nose or mouth ? EMMA : No . MAN : ... department has just instructed us to cancel classes for today . Now this is just a precaution ... No . No , it was one of the other girls in the class . - Where is she ? - Hang on . She 's fine . - Honey , she 's fine , I 'm telling you . - Mom , I 'm fine . See ? She 's fine . What about you ?

A bunch of us are waiting here . Girls , listen to me , this is important . The whole county 's under quarantine . - What does that mean ? - Means we 're fucked . Stacey .

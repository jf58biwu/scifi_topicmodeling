 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . The child- - part human , part alien- - Was unlike anything the world had ever seen . My other child is a life-like android . Mom ? He has become the prototype For a new breed of thinking machines Called humanichs . These two extraordinary new life-forms Now hold the key to earth 's future . But where does that leave us ? Over 99 % of all species That have every existed have gone extinct . What if it 's our time ? Previously on extant ... Run ! Molly : Shepherd released that virus . A lot of the hybrids have been exposed . ( coughing ) My son ahdu is dying . There are some You cannot trust . Molly : Ares . Ahdu : And ... Terra . Good night , rabbit . Good night , mom . You have obviously done something To his memories . I was protecting him ! There are good humanichs , And there are bad humanichs . Lucy : My upload is going into All of those humanichs ? Lucky them . I never installed lucy 's limiters . Do you realize what you 've done ? Charlie : Lucy is one of the bad ones . Good-bye , julie . What did i do ? If i turn myself in , They 'll release kelsey . Shepherd : Where 's molly ? You killed her . ( coughing ) Richter : You exposed her to the virus . You wanted me , toby . You got me . Oh , god , what have i done to you ? ( monitor beeping rhythmically ) Nate : Get her core temp down . Up the recmesc for the pain . I need samples , full metabolic panel . I need to run the viral dna Against the database . What are we looking for ? Oh , i don 't know . A woman 's dying of a virus She created ; maybe we 're looking for a cure . Fiona : Doesn 't look as if you have much time . I would steer the conversation quickly To the matter at hand . How many hybrids have survived the virus , How many there are around the world . Yes , madam secretary , i know what we need . Then go get it . ( door hissing open ) ( door hissing , latch clicks ) ( quietly ) : Sorry about all the ... Poking and prodding . You should study me . Learn from me . What i could 've been . I need to ask you some questions , you know , Uh , ' cause , um ... You 're the only one who can give me answers . I gave you an answer . They 're not the enemy . I can 't take that on faith , Molly . So you steal john 's work To create an army of humanichs . Machines to hurt living creatures . Soldiers , To win a war . You want war . They want peace . You 're wasting your time , toby . The human race- - not worth saving . You don 't mean that . I don 't have time To say things that i don 't mean . You killed john , didn 't you ? I swear to you , I had nothing to do with john 's death . You 're gonna die One day , too , Toby . You should try Speaking the truth . Does the soul good . I need to know how many survived And where they went . You want answers ? Well , first ... There 's something i want . Fiona : So ... I hear we have a problem . Lucy . Lucy is The problem . Care to elaborate ? She overheard us talking about Potentially shutting her down , and she attacked me . Well , you were talking about shutting her down . It 's both human And humanich , is it not , the will to survive ? A-all due respect , i think You 're missing the point , here . Lucy tried to kill a human being . Not only does that go against humanich protocol , But it raises into question the safety of any humanichs With her operating system . It also begs the question why you were talking about Shutting her down in the first place . She was showing indications Of a very defiant streak . Charlie : We wanted to nip it In the bud . Madame secretary , I have two dozen operational humanichs , all on standby . I want your authorization To shut them down and to suspend Activation for a thousand plus . Because they all have lucy 's programming . Yes . No virus in the history of the world Has ever been 100 % lethal . Did you know that ? Humanichs are the ultimate solution To the hybrid question . Yeah , well , what 's your solution to the humanichs question ? We have promised our allies Humanichs who will be operational And available immediately . The hybrid threat cannot be contained Without them . Now , i 'm not a technical person , But your concerns Sound like glitches that can be fixed . So i suggest you fix them . Fast . ( charlie sighs ) Okay . So now what the hell do we do ? We get those limiters put back on fast , And download them into all those other humanichs Before they 're activated . All right . We can 't screw this up again . Shepherd : Ms. Gelineau . There 's something you need to know . We have molly woods In custody . She 's dying . What ? Her final wish Is to see ethan . Dying of what ? Nate : We recovered the hybrid bodies for research . We 're going to conduct some tests . Ethan ... I 'm leaving you this video log In hopes it helps you fill in the blanks one day . You 're gonna be looking for answers . I know i still am . I tried to be a good mother , Wife . Didn 't always come easy . I don 't know why . ( raspy breathing ) My mother died When i was about your age . Your grandpa ... ( inhales ) Well You know grandpa . Quinn ( distantly ) : Baby girl . ( raspy breathing ) ( people laughing , talking ) Quinn : Baby girl ! Molly : Daddy ? One and the same . ( laughing ) Mmm ! Brought you some cotton candy . ( laughs ) What 's happening ? This is our special day . You are going to have the time of your life . ( maniacal laughter ) Take the restraints off . Why , are we gonna play chess ? No . Molly woods has turned herself in In exchange for your release . Where is she ? We 're doing all we can for her . Doing all you can ? You mean like releasing a virus that 's killing her ? Where the hell is she ? In quarantine . Now listen , you were there . You saw them . What can you tell me ? 'cause i need something . Oh , you need something . I 'm not telling you anything Until i see molly . ( children shouting , laughing ) L-let 's play that alien game first , all right ? Molly : Okay . Can we ? Quinn : Yeah , that 's why we 're here , that 's what i said . Man : Good to see you . I wish mommy was here . Oh , well , uh , she had to run some errands . Uh , but , uh , this is our special day . Molly : Wait . Quinn : What 's the matter ? That 's ethan . Who ? Ethan , wait ! ( groans ) Come on , baby . We don 't have very much time . Come on . Come on , let 's go ... We 're going to go this way . I never meant to hurt lucy . I don 't want to hurt anyone . Ever . And you never will , ethan . You 're not like the others , like lucy . You have humanity . And the other humanichs , like lucy , They don 't have this ? I don 't think so . Ethan , when i changed your memory function , I was trying to keep you from the pain of losing your parents . Ethan , your mo ... Molly is very sick . What 's the matter with her ? Turns out that her body went through Some pretty unusual changes after her pregnancy . What kind of changes ? There are parts of the hybrids inside of her That are making her feel more like them . Ethan , Molly may not get better , And the thing she wants the most is to see you . I 'd like that . First , There 's something we need to do . You sure you 're okay with this ? I 'm sure . All right . See you on the other side , bud . Verdisign : Root core has been accessed . Are you sure you wish to proceed ? Memory download is commencing . I put the family in the space station , They 'd be safe . Want to try mine ? Okay . Mom , you made me drop my ice cream ! Have this one . This is how my dad taught me , and i fell a lot . Dad , let go . Ethan ! Do you want to teach me more ? John : Ethan ! Verdisign : Memory download is complete . ( sighs ) It 's done . Hi , charlie . Hi , julie . Hi , rabbit . I need tissue , blood , bone marrow panels up now . I need matches to molly 's results . Tommy , bring up the previous viral constructs . Let 's see if we missed anything there . Naomi , we 're gonna take the little girl , See if there 's anything different about her pathology . I 'm hungry . Anyone else hungry ? ( beep , door hissing open ) Hey . It 's me . Crazy couple of weeks , huh ? You , uh , turned my world upside down , And then you gave it a good shake . But , you know what , i wouldn 't change a second of it . You opened my eyes , molly . Y-you made me see things In myself and other people that ... I never would have found on my own . That 's what you do , you ... You make the world see things . That 's your gift . You are the bravest And strongest person That i 've ever met in my entire life . You fight this . You beat this virus . Damn it , don 't you give up . People , they-they need you . I need you . I , um Got a bottle of scotch in my office . That 's my drink of choice . Man ( distantly , echoing ) : They call it a game of chance ... Game of chance . ( carnival music plays ) there is no chance . They call it a game of chance , But here at the carnival , there is no chance . Here , everything happens for a reason . In your line of work , there are no coincidences . That 's right , little lady . Quinn : Now , you leave my daughter alone . She 's not interested in playing any of your games . Now , baby girl , if we linger , We gonna miss the chance to play galactic attack . Huh ? Come on . Whew , never know what kind of characters You 're gonna meet in a carnival . I guess that 's part of the charm . Here we are . Quinn : Hey , what do you know about that ? That 's mrs . Caber , The next-door neighbor . Um , now , baby , here . You get busy bringing these aliens back to earth , okay ? And don 't you wander off now . I 'm gonna pay my respects . I don 't want to be alone , daddy . Don 't worry , i 'll be back . Please . Want to help the galactic attack ? Here 's the thing about tofu tuna . It tastes like tofu that 's been stored in dirty socks . Tommy : You ever wonder what real tuna tasted like ? Nate : Every time i eat sock tuna . Why i 'm eating genetically engineered tofu instead of ... What the hell ? Nate : Naomi ? Terra : I think you 're looking for me . That ain 't half bad . 25 years old . It was a gift from the president . Let me ask you something , general . How is it you make a virus like that And not an antidote ? We didn 't have the luxury of time , And i didn 't know that molly was ... You care for her quite a bit , don 't you ? I hate playing catch-up . Aliens . Intelligent life-forms from another galaxy . I 've seen some things since this started i never thought i 'd see . Seems to me , it 's not about what you see , It 's what you do about what you see . Oh , uh , this the , uh , moral high ground You 're about to take again ? Terrorists aren 't born , they are made . They 're made by dropping bioweapons When you say you have a peace treaty . Or by wiping out a platoon of your people Because you may or may not have a shot At a single high-value target . Oh , so now we 're talking second kuwait , Not about hybrids . I lost a lot of men . And walked away from the fight . It didn 't seem like my fight anymore . Something you learn When you 're the one giving the orders- - Sometimes There are no good decisions . It 's just a lesser of two evils . And from my seat , that 's the best that you can do . Evil is still evil , general . Even when it 's lesser . She thinks i killed her husband . Molly does . So do i . He was my friend . Your friend that just happened to have An accident while you were stealing His program out from underneath him . Seems awfully coincidental , don 't you think ? Yeah . And i don 't believe in coincidences . But you do believe he was murdered . Yes , i do . Man : She can 't you hurt in there . It 's a faraday cage . Faraday cages . The copper in the walls and the ceilings Block radio transmission frequencies . It also blocks hybrids from emitting Electro-magnetic impulses . Yeah . So don 't worry . We 're not worried . ( chuckles ) I want to go in first . Just for a second , okay ? You gonna be all right ? Okay . ( beep , door hissing open ) ( monitor beeping rhythmically ) ( door hissing , latch clicks ) Molly , i don 't know if you can hear me . But i brought ethan here . I just wanted to talk to you first . A couple things . Things i want to say . Things i want you to understand . They were gonna shut ethan down permanently . So i took him to save him . ( crying ) : And the reprogramming ... He was just hurting so bad . I was so wrong . I was so foolish . But john loved you , molly . He loved you to the very end . I swear . The night he died , He was so angry . And he said i was being naive . Molly , i ... I think i may have somehow ... Gotten him killed . He was right about the humanichs . He said i was making a deal with the devil . I 've made so many wrong choices , molly . But i promise you ... I won 't ever do that again . Girl : Where 's my dad ? Daddy ? Daddy ? Where 's my daddy ? Don 't worry about it . I 'm sure he 's around here somewhere . Hey ! Daddy ! Wait , come back ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! ( moaning ) Daddy ? Daddy ! Honey ... I remember now . You brought me here So you could have your tryst with mrs . Caber . Baby girl ... ( crying ) : How could you ? Wait ! We do it and we do it now . Charlie : Wait . What are you saying , julie ? I 'm saying i don 't care What happens , i 'm not making The wrong decision again . Shut the program down , charlie . You realize we could go to jail for this . Yeah , i do . Okay , just so we 're on the same page . I need the security doors opened . Of course , general shepherd . Happy to help . Terra . It worked . They thought i was dead . We tried it ahdu 's way . And now we do it mine . ( gun cocks ) ( gunshot ) All right , here 's ... Here 's what i know . John went to humanichs , he-he got in a fight With julie . Leaves . She makes a call to some encrypted number . And-and an hour later , john was dead . No , julie gelineau is not a killer . Yeah , but whoever she called ... Yeah , anna , my colleague . She doesn 't have the authority . No , whoever made that call came from above . But every time i sniff around , The trail goes cold . Maybe you 're not inhaling deep enough , general . Don 't you think I want to know the truth ? ( laughs softly ) You know what ? Maybe it 's this ... Presidential scotch Kicking in , But i actually believe you . Sometimes decisions are made That leave no fingerprints . And there are people above me , Nameless people who always get what they want . No matter the cost . That 's right . Did john have any enemies outside the gsc ? What ? I don 't know , man . I 'm just thinking out loud . Yeah , one . Who ? Nicholas calderon , but that was a long time ago . Richter : Stop that image . Pause image . G-go back . Rewind . Stop . Richter : You 've got hybrids . And not the warm , fuzzy kind . Security . We have a breach . ( alarm buzzing ) Charlie : Damn , another shut down failure . Cancel the install . I mean , the limiters won 't reload . How is that possible ? Evolution . They 've changed . Their-their decision trees have grown new branches . What i 'm saying is do not take them off standby mode . And what we 're gonna need to do is begin a physical disassembly . For real ? Yes , carol , for very real . Arms in one box , Heads in another ? If we have to . And come on , guys , we need to do this right now Before they learn how to turn themselves back on . Alert voice : Attention . This is a call for the immediate deployment Of the humanichs force to gsc . Repeat- - this is a call for the immediate deployment Of the humanichs force to gsc . ( carnival music playing ) ¶ ¶ ( child giggling ) ( film projector clicking ) John : Molly , it 's been over for a while , i swear . Molly : Weird how ? Ethan : To be back in my body again , but ... Bigger . John : It was a mistake . Ethan : It was like i was a bird ... Molly : A mistake ? A mistake ... This , what you 've been doing ... I 'm an astronaut . It 's my job . ( overlapping voices ) John : Yes , i-i did . I lied . Turns out you ... ( quinn clears his throat ) Oh , there you are , baby girl . You know , sometimes ... We see things and we misunderstand . Yeah . And you tried to convince me That i didn 't see anything . You said i could get cotton candy . I 'm sorry . Sorry about what ? Because you got caught ? You lied to me , daddy . You brought me to this carnival So you could see your mistress . And you used Your nine-year-old little daughter ! It 's not like that . It 's-it 's complicated . You were screwing the neighbor . What 's so complicated about that ? Molly : Then you should have said something , Not screw your lab assistant in our house ! ( cell phone ringing ) Go ahead . Answer it . You answer it , and they tell you about the crash . And they tell you that mommy 's dead . ( phone continues ringing ) Her car ran off the road and hit a tree . All while you were back there With mrs . Caber behind the ride . So go ahead , answer it . Answer it , you bastard . ( maniacal laughter ) I can 't find my mom . I 'm lost ! Me , too . I 'm lost , too . Maybe we can help each other . There 's your mom right there . No , she 's not my mom . I want my real mom . Kid 's lost , huh ? He 's looking for his m ... Miss ? Hey . You all right ? No . Ethan : Mom , it 's me . I have to go . Ethan : Mom ? Please don 't go . I have to go . Mom , i 'm here . I think my ... My special day is over . Ethan : I know who i am . I know who you are . Mom , it 's me , ethan . I 'm here . Please don 't go . ( alarm sounds ) ( line ringing ) Julie : This is julie , leave a message at the beep . ( beeps ) ( computer chirps ) Electronic voice : Incoming call . Incoming call . Incoming call . This is tobias shepherd . Uh , hello , sir . This is a code red . We have hybrids here- - in the gsc . We 've had casualties already . Their intent is clear . If you don 't deploy the humanichs now , i have to assume That the casualty rate here will be 100 % . But julie and ethan are there . Along with about 700 others . All counting on you . Take them off standby . And god help us . ¶ ¶ ( maniacal laughter ) ( maniacal laughter ) ( carnival music plays ) ( molly groans , gasps ) What 's wrong with her ? Electronic voice : Medical alert . Code blue . ( gasping ) Life functions critical . We 're under attack . I need to take you to a secure bunker . This woman needs a doctor now ! That 's impossible ; we 're in lockdown . Mom ! Mom ! Somebody do something ! Medical alert . Code blue . Life functions critical . ( gasping ) ¶ ¶ You don 't have to take that ride right now , baby girl . I made up my mind . What are you doing ? She 's trying to decide whether she 's gonna take that ride . Why ? Uh , she 's given up on us . Richter : Ah , the easy way out . Quinn : Mm , looks like it . Eh , why bother ? So you both are a part of me , Projections of my thoughts and feelings , right ? So why don 't you tell me why i shouldn 't get on this ride ? Quinn : Hey , hey , you 're right , baby girl . People are hopeless . They make mistakes that they don 't learn from , And even when we try to help them , they screw up again . This is your idea of helping ? Quinn : Molly , y-you can give up . And you have every right to do so . But here 's the thing about this world . Now , you may decide that , uh , things will never change , And there 's nothing you can do about it , And you still try your best anyway , huh ? That 's what keeps us from going under . It 's the struggle . Mistakes are what makes us human . All of us . But forgiveness , that gives us humanity . It 's time , baby girl . It 's time to forgive me . Forgive john . And forgive yourself . I should have been a better wife and mother . Eh , you and everybody else on the planet . John cheated on me , daddy . I couldn 't forgive him . Just like i couldn 't forgive you . Loving doesn 't come easy to me . Can 't you see , daddy ? I 've been running from you and mrs . Caber my whole life . Room for one more . Wait , baby , come on , you can 't change the past , But you can change the future . You are the future . With you , the human race evolves . Without you ... Carny : Time 's running out here , doll . Ethan : Mom , mom . Don 't go . Ethan . Okay , wait . I want to go back ... I want to go back ! Let me go back ! I want to go ... It 's too late , lady . You 've made your choice . ( alarm sounding ) Ethan : Mom , wake up . Please wake up . ( alarm sounding ) ( monitor flatlines ) She 's gone , honey . No . No ! We have to go now . No , i won 't . Let 's go . Let 's go . Now ! ( monitor flatlines ) ( alarm sounding ) ( door hissing closed , latch clicks ) ( alarm sounds ) There 's poetry to it , isn 't there ? They make a virus to destroy us . We release viruses to destroy them . Hey , we 're counting on you . Electronic voice : System overload . System overload . System overload . ( monitor continues flatlining )

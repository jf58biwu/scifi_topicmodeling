 ( STAFF CLANGS ) Get up . ( HUFFS ) My Lord . GABRIEL KREUTZ : Monsignor Mosca , this is a most unexpected pleasure . I was told tomorrow . Tomorrow ? Time is subject to our will . Rome grows impatient . We know not what you do , only what you cost . There are rumors of your work . There are always rumors . ( STAFF CLANGS ) Monsignor Mosca , we have discussed this before . This must be clear . That the more we understand about science , the more we understand that the borders between physics and faith are blurred . Membrane thin , at best . Let us get to the point . Yes , let us get to the point . Religion is dead . ( CHURCH BELL TOLLS ) I have said it . You know it , I know it . The faithful have fled . But with this work here , I can bring them back . What cost is too high to return the flock to the field , hmm ? Through science . Indeed . You must know , I 've seen the records at the orphanage . ( STAFF CLANGING ) Open this door . GABRIEL : Allow me to explain . They are essential to my work . My reputation ... Reputation ? A man of science who turned into a man of God when it suited him to have his research funded . Monsignor , you cannot possibly begin to understand what you are about to witness . Oh , really ? And what exactly will I witness ? A quantum connection with the human mind . Show him . ( BREATH TREMBLING ) Dear God . It 's true . GABRIEL : The future of faith is here . The future of mankind itself is in her . This is your work ? This abomination ! ( SPEAKING IN ITALIAN ) ( GRUNTS ) I must ask you not to interfere . ( GASPS ) ( WHIRRING ) ( ALARM BEEPING ) ( ELECTRICAL STATIC ) ( ELECTRICAL STATIC ) MAN : ( ON TV ) Consciousness . ( STATIC CONTINUES ) What is the physics of consciousness ? What are the origins of consciousness ? What are the limits of human potential ? MAN 2 : What had not been done before was actually one human sending information to another human 's brain . The technology exists right now . We can record from one brain ... MAN 3 : With brain implants already installed in a lot of people , there 's a cochlear implant , so ... Steve thought that he would allow my brain to connect with his brain . He created the first brain-to-brain direct communication ... WOMAN 1 : A new kind of connectivity , a new kind of interplay . Me to my computer , my computer to you ... MAN 4 : It 's said that the EES integrates with the skin , and suddenly everybody is chipped , everybody is monitored , everybody is trackable anywhere on Earth . That the mark of the beast technology is just about here . The computer is going to take over the activities of the brain . It 's very , very serious . Desperately serious . I see a bright future , a new genus of humanity . Smarter , faster , marvelously gracile . DA SILVA : In your own time . And straight to the camera , please . Dylan Harvey . Applying for audio biometrics with a specialty in spatial unification . Agnes Day , 821 . Cognitive psychology . Maddie Romero , 117 . Cybernetic ethics and philosophy . Rollo Fipps , 993 . Neuroengineering . Jaxon Freeman , 909 . Applied quantum biology . Technology offers us evolution without end . DYLAN : ENR . Emotional Neural Reader . Ludwig van Beatbox , that 's what I call my processor . See , you don 't , uh , program Ludwig . ( CHUCKLES ) He , uh ... He feels you . He frame grabs your mind . Music made by my tears only . This connects me to what ? DA SILVA : The faculty surveillance network . And it 's a condition of entry that we wear one ? Everyone , at all times . For your own security . Huh . DA SILVA : Do you believe in organized religion ? There is no life after death . Because there is no death , just a doorway . The ENR , this whole idea came to me on a suicide Tuesday . So there you go , people . That 's a positive drug story . DA SILVA : Perhaps a person that inspired you ? Uh , yeah . I 'd say there was . The Dalai Lama meeting Anton Zeilinger . Two hands embracing , locked together . Sir Henry Head . DA SILVA : And he is ? A Victorian neurologist . He wanted to know how the brain perceives pain . So , one by one , he cut the nerve fibers of his own body . To get somewhere , sometimes you gotta go too far . ( GASPING ) ( GASPING ) MAN : ( ON RECORDING ) Help me . ( EXCLAIMS ) Help me . ( EXHALES ) ( GROANING ) Help me . ( GROANS ) ( ALARM CHIMING ) The late Agnes Day . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( GASPS ) MAN : ( ON PA ) AH personnel report to your supervisor . I totally flunked my superposition test . ( DOOR BUZZES ) ( DOG BARKING DISTANTLY ) You 're early . The assessments weren 't set till midday . Time is subject to our will , Mr. Freeman . ( KEYBOARD BEEPING ) Team leader . You choose curious collaborators . For example , Mr. Fipps . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) I call this process MoSkA , Motor Skills Assimilation . There 's no one better . I implanted a single neurochip into the brain of the control rat . Then , over a series of months , I taught it a complex motor skill , like negotiating a maze or completing an obstacle course . I then connected it via hub computer to an untrained decoder rat . The decoder rat downloaded the skills and instantly performed the same task . From mice to men . ( LAUGHS ) That 's my plan . Scale it up to a human level . ASSESSOR : A basic error , Mr. Fipps . Yes , I know . ( CHUCKLES ) No computer 's bloody big enough , but given time , we are bound to ... ( RAT SQUEAKS ) ( SIGHS ) And what have we here ? A mass organic network . Their connected brains can handle more data than every computer on the campus . And the brains trust that you call your team ? No , I 'm working on this idea alone . But with Mr. Fipps ' rats . The rats belong to everyone . Unlike this moment 's glory . Indeed , Mr. Freeman , trust just to yourself . The mind is all that matters . And yours , dear boy , is undamaged . Your body 's still strong . Just the nerves are severed . And who needs wires ? What merits Mr. Harvey ? JAXON : Emotional mapping . He 's fast . Flawless . ( DISTORTED SCREAMING ) My man . ( LAUGHS ) Deviants and devouts . In your eyes . We need a team project . ( LAUGHS ) No . We can help you get your body back . Miss Romero seems hell-bent on making the world believe , in what ? We want proof . And I believe quantum mechanics can provide it . The double-slit experiment proved by observing a particle , we change reality . Meaning , all matter is nothing but vibration until it collides with human consciousness . ASSESSOR : I 'm sorry , you 've lost me . My mind only exists because another consciousness is observing me , and another observing that . Infinite numbers of observers . Or , there 's just one overarching consciousness observing everything . No . No , I 'm not finished yet ! I 've given two possible explanations . Science dictates the most simple is likely to be correct . The multiverse theory demands an infinite number of observers . My explanation requires only one . So , which would you say was the more elegant ? ASSESSOR : This ardent advocacy of the single observer theory is what , Miss Romero ? A valiant stab at proving God ? You used the word " God , " not me . And Miss Agnes Day . What of her ? Agnes , she can 't be categorized . A woman stands on a rooftop , leans forward . Will she fall ? Will she live or will she die ? I propose that she will live . She must live . Always . So we have no choice but to continuously exist , somewhere . She leans , looks down . Two possible outcomes . One , she falls , cracks like a bloody egg on the concrete below . But what then happens to the second outcome ? She pulls back , survives . That outcome must continue to play out somewhere because nothing , once brought into reality by a thought , can ever be destroyed . So if we choose to collapse one reality , to bring it down , the other will be forced into existence . An extension of ... The lovely Schriidinger . You understand ? Your deductive equation , please . I 'm working on it . Miss Day , your proof ? You 'll get it when I 'm finished . ASSESSOR : Secrets shared , Mr. Freeman . You could be trusted . What is that ? We gave you authorized access . Oh , fuck , is that military ? JAXON : A research base in Nevada . Check it out . Using electrodes in the transmitter gel , they 've connected this guy 's brain activity to another guy in San Jose . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GROANS SOFTLY ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Three , ( GROANING ) two , one . Fire . ( CRYING ) ( SCREAMS ) He had no choice but to fire . His finger was under the control of another man 's brain . All that we have done , every advantage afforded you . There have been experiments . Promising results . A human specimen procured . Which makes me what ? Your rat ? ( ALL CHUCKLING ) No , no , no . Our rat . JAXON : Connection established . And we are in . You know what to do . Feel yourself moving . Think of it . Picture it . ( POWERING UP ) ( ALARM BLARING ) ( POWERING DOWN ) Two years of work and no results . We grow impatient . ( BIRDS FLUTTERING ) Hey . What 's the deal ? She 'll never get through . Her blood tox will register . Mass security . And the question is , why ? I 've never seen this before , not at this level . Whatever they 've brought us here for , it 's big . Full biometrics . She 'll be fine . MAN : ( ON PA ) Attention , all students . Please keep the way clear . We ask for your patience . MAN 2 : Who is that ? The Force is fucked in that one . DA SILVA : This was a turning point in his research . Some would say the birth of modern neuroscience . By implanting an electrode into the brain , he proved how every basic emotion could be stimulated upon command . ( OX BELLOWING ) ( CONTINUES BELLOWING ) From aggression to instant calm . By the late ' 90s , his work progressed into neural-digital interfacing . Primates were taught within hours to operate artificial limbs through thought alone . And then began his groundbreaking work into neuron manipulation . Victims of severe brain damage had many basic functions restored . Their only sacrifice ? A loss of free will . For this work , came criticism . His ethics questioned . Accusations you will all experience . Do we improve the mind ? Or do we violate the soul ? In the face of opposition , in the pursuit of progress , he labored on until fate cruelly intervened . And spirit alone bore him on . His resolve made ever stronger to build this house of determinism . Dominatio ad Menta . Mastery of the mind . His vision , his cause . Please join me now in welcoming Professor Gabriel Kreutz . ( INDISTINCT WHISPERS ) ( AUDIENCE GASPING ) To see you gathered here , the best and the brightest set upon this great scientific journey to understand the human mind . You cannot imagine the pride I feel . You cannot know my elation , and that , in itself , is surely intolerable . We should know every impulse of each other 's minds . You should have within your grasp the ability to measure my every thought . Progress demands it , evolution expects it . ( GROANS AND CLEARS THROAT ) It 's okay . ( GABRIEL COUGHS ) The human brain is the most complex device in the known universe . Eighty billion neural columns housed within the arc of our skulls . But here 's the thing . There is no binary computer powerful enough to process all that data . To truly comprehend that which comprehends , that is the human mind , we need , as they say , a bigger boat . And so I give you ... ( AUDIENCE GASPING ) En.o.Ch. The first device in the world to operate upon entangled neutrino charms . Dear Lord . It 's quantum . GABRIEL : En.o.Ch ! I delight in this acronym . For it is written that God rewarded an obedient Enoch by removing his mind from his flesh so that he might live infinitely and everywhere . Appearances aside , I am not God . But I am looking among you for one group , one individual above all , who is capable of dedicating En.o.Ch to their work alone . All of you have that potential . Realize that potential ! WOMAN : One moment , please ! I have a question . Feel free . I do . Sol must ask , who will benefit from the creation of En.o.Ch ? Everyone . Everyone you deem a genius . Everyone who shares your ambition . Since you know your Bible , might I remind you of a basic Christian tenet ? The rich man must share what he has with the poor . Shouldn 't the same apply to the sharing of intellectual wealth ? Whatever new reality En.o.Ch might reveal , it is one in which we all belong . But I don 't think you will allow this . You will choose . You have chosen . Your motives are compromised and your intentions egocentric . And you ... Wake up . ( GASPS ) She doesn 't fall . You saved her . Hey , are you okay ? Mmm-hmm . Hey " baby girl . AGNES : Wow ... You promise me you 'll cut down , go easy . I 'll cut right down . I 'll go real easy . Pink or blue . You choose . Get him out . Yeah . Not now . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Mr. Freeman ! ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( DOORS CLOSING ) Good evening . Good evening . Good evening . A summons from the Master . ( FLY BUZZES ) You 'll need to change . Got a phone box ? Uh ... Nipple rings . Thorn in your side . Body art not for you then . Quite right . Even I wouldn 't pierce an asshole . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) BOY : Nice suit , Jaxon ! WOMAN : Nice suit , Jaxon ! Evening . JAXON : ( ON RECORDING ) This is fucking crazy ! I don 't even know what I 'm doing here ! ASSESSOR : Unlicensed animal experimentation . The rat ? You 're talking about the fucking rat ? ASSESSOR : You severed its spine . I had to ! People like you , you 'll never understand . I have the cure for spinal injury . So , a paralyzed leg still has functioning muscles . It 's only the fibers carrying the nerve signal that are damaged . So the leg would move again if we could bypass those fibers , create a wireless neural network , which we can . h ' we control the process , we could effect a new kind of connectivity . ( SCOFFS ) One mind to another . One body to another . ( ENGINE REVVING ) ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTS ) Wait ! ( MACHINE POWERING UP ) ( PULSING ) Holy shit . Holy shit . It 's superfluid . ( PULSING CONTINUES ) A gravitational field . So it 's volatile . But if it was stable , we ... Deux Ex Machine . God from the machine . I served God once , you know . When it served my purpose . Ambition makes whores of us all , don 't you find ? And then , this punishment , this cruel vengeance . It 's enough to make you believe that He exists . I 'm sorry , am I boring you ? No . Oh , good . God forbid . Your companions , each one with a particular skill , so willing to share . And none of them suspecting that the dream they serve is yours alone . You 're wrong . I 'm all kinds of wrong , Mr. Freeman . Look at me ! Come here . You know , when I look at you , I see so much of myself . And that is why I have faith in you , faith in your work . I believe that you can make these wrongs right . So , here 's the deal . I get my body restored , and you , you get what you always wanted . GABRIEL : ( ECHOING ) I give you En.o.Ch. ( GASPS ) ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( PANTING ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( BIRDS FLUTTERING ) PROFESSOR MARKUS DEEKS : ( ON TV ) The mind is the dominion of God . None but he can lift it from the flesh . But now , technology is catching up with the prophecy . If you don 't believe in prophecy , that is your right , but might ! Quote Revelation 13 : 16 . And the beast shall cause all , both rich and poor , to bear his mark upon their head . " Now , these bio tags . We see them everywhere , behind every ear , fusing with the skin , leaving a mark . How can we pursue the study of cybernetic ethics when that same technology can alter our thinking ? AGNES : All particles in all places at all times . A single unified field connecting everything . Every outcome existing . And I can choose , we can choose , to leave one to enter another . ( EN.O.CH PULSING ) VOLTAIRE : So , you 've got more power ? JAXON : I 've got En.o.Ch. First I connected Aggie , the control rat . Even-tempered , a calming influence on the pack . It was unbelievable . Then , I go for more . I added Maddie . She 's vicious . ( SQUEAKING ) And I guess I knew what was gonna happen , but I had to see . Torn to shreds , neck broken . And then , as soon as I replaced Aggie , peace returns . The unity . And now ... ( LAUGHS SOFTLY ) And now , watch this . Jesus Christ . ( LAUGHS ) What 's he done now ? Who are you ? WOMAN : Hey , Voltaire . You know her ? No . You 've given them all names . You wanna give me yours ? Or , maybe what you 're doing here ? What are you doing here ? Agnes . She 's finished . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( GASPING ) ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) ( SNIFFLES ) ( GASPS ) I couldn 't get the nails out . That 's her robe . Is this hers , too ? I 'll keep it then . You never know when I might need to take down Christ . DA SILVA : Still raw , no doubt , the hurt . ( SUMS ) Deadlines loom , and you must complete . A team replacement has been found . ( HUFFS ) She 's new to the faculty and quite brilliant . Too brilliant , some say . I hope that ... Well , we hope that working in a group will tame her . ( INDISTINCT WHISPERING ) ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) No hot liquids in the lab . Is cold indifference okay ? ( SUMS ) So , you 're what ? A programmer ? A neuroscientist , a nanotech quantum biologist ? Yes . Well , we 'd all like to welcome you to the team . ( ELECTRICAL STATIC ) What did you do ? MADDIE : And by His sword , that is the word , He shall bring down the false world . And by His sword , that is the word , He shall bring down the false world . ROLLO : It was her final proof . There is no end to existence , merely an infinite shift to another reality . If you end this outcome , another will be forced into existence . All things , all places , at all times . Aggie was smart , calm . Someone interfered . What ? In my experiment . The rat . You 're talking about the fucking rat ? I just ... And by His sword , that is the word ... ROLLO : We should have seen the signs ! He shall bring down the false world . ( ARGUING CONTINUES ) And by His sword , that is the word , He shall bring down the false world . And by His sword ... ROLLO : She 's fucking dead ! Everyone grieves in their own way . Maddie . ( THUDDING ) ( BIRDS SQUEAKING ) ( SQUEAKING CONTINUES ) ( WOMAN PANTING ) ROLLO : She 's mad to come here . Girl 's dangerous . I like that . You 've had enough to like Pol Pot . Hey ! Guys . ( SNAPS FINGERS ) We have to get her out . Wait . We can 't just stand by . ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) You bloody well let her go , or you 'll get a face-full of fist ! ( sums ) My word . ROLLO : Look , I know that it 's theoretically possible . But Voltaire has zero mobility . So the amount of processing required to move just , well , his hand , is incomprehensible ! I mean , just look at the neural transmission rate . The data flow for a human is ... Well , it 's incalculable . Fuck me . It 's a hand job only , mate . Give it time . ROLLO : But to handle this amount of data ... You 'd need access to a very rare quantum computer . En.o.Ch. But she didn 't have the codes . How did she ... How did " we " ? Ajoint effort . We all played a part . MADDIE : Including Agnes ? She had an essential role , correct ? I mean , if she hadn 't killed herself , you wouldn 't be here . Right ? DYLAN : Madds , come on . DEEKS : ( ECHOING ) The mind is the dominion of God . The mind is the dominion of God . And only He shall lift it from the flesh . ( ALARM BLARING ) This must stop . VOLTAIRE : Stop ? What does she mean , stop ? You 're not gonna stop ? Hey ! You 're not gonna stop ! She shouldn 't be alone . Come on . VOLTAIRE : Do you know what this means ? I get my body back . I 'd get my life back . You hearing me ? You want this , Jaxon . I want this . What the fuck ? It 's not possible . I don 't believe it . Jaxon ! Double-blind air vaults , these are all my sig moves . Are you getting this now ? You didn 't just connect Voltaire . You tapped your own tag , too . The two of you , on the network , both transmitting . You to him , and him to you . You stole the codes . Ambition makes whores of us all . He summoned you ? Gave you my data , my research ? No ! No , no ! My work , that you stole ! Because you 're you . And Mr. Freeman has to be first ! And I get that . And I don 't care . We 're friends . We share . Me first . ( PULSING ) You sure , big guy ? How long does it take to ... ( GASPS ) Holy shit ! ( PANTING ) It feels ... It feels good . Take it slow , all right ? ( LAUGHING ) I did it . I fucking did it . ( CONTINUES LAUGHING ) Spark it up . ( WIND BLOWING ) VOLTAIRE : ( MENTALLY ) I feel it . It feels strong . Now the left . JAXON : I was right . Next step , he walks . ROLLO : It works . MoSkA works . DYLAN : We just ripped the world a new worm hole . This is just the beginning . This can 't stop . I want more . Which means more neural pads . VOLTAIRE : How many do you need ? I 've got 20 in my crew . DYLAN : That 's not enough . More like 200 . It 's the black and white tonight . My God , he 's right ! We could do everyone . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) STELLA : No ! Someone must stay off the system . We need a control rat . It 's what you want . It 's what you 've always wanted . The moment he gets his body back , and you get proved right . ( CHUCKLES ) You always get what you want ? No . ( ALARM BLARING ) MOSCA : Get up !

His familiars are set forth amongst us . Hidden , as your friends . You don 't know it , but you labor for the devil . Two hundred years ago , a man named Enoch Taylor built the machines of the industrial revolution . But when he saw ... Madds ! The misery that they wrought ... You can change this feeling . We can help you . He turned his furnaces to a new purpose . To build hammers for the masses to smash those same machines . Enoch 's hammer filled with righteous revolt to unmask the devil . ( IN DEMONIC VOICE ) That which Enoch made , Enoch shall destroy . ( ECHOING ) Destroy . You shall feel him everywhere . My beloved daughter . ( BREATH SHAKING ) DEEKS : Do your duty . Jax !

It believes itself to be a distinct , individual personality . It is the ego , the me . The right side , however , is entirely different . It has no logic , no memory . It can only experience the now , this moment . It has no sense of self . Instead , it believes itself to be part of everything that it experiences . My left side was blocked . ( DA SILVA MOANING ) ( BONES CREAKING ) GABRIEL : Touching her , and yet , not touching . My logic functions , my sense of self , leaving me . I am released . I am within the unified field . It exists , it is real , and it is wonderful . I didn 't want to come back . But , for good or ill , I survived . " For good or ill . " I ponder that phrase . One outcome , or another . The seizure could have caused catastrophic damage to my brain , leaving me physically and spiritually crippled . But , I was spared . I walked away unharmed . And I believe for a reason . To lead you all to the field . And when we get there , we should not fear the loss of self . We should not ask , " What becomes of us ? " Instead , we should wonder , " What do we become ?

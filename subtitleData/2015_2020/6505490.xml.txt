 - Just please rethink this . - Dude , this 'll work . I know these things . I 'm a scientist . A computer scientist . - This is dangerous ! - Trust . You can 't put mouthwash into cookie batter . It 's idiotic . There 's , like , fluoride and crap in that . Fluoride is good for you . And try to deny that mint chocolate chip is the best cookie . Just try . To the quiz cave ! I have a massive power flux on all circuits . Robo-Bo ! Status update ! St. Cloud has tapped into our power grid . One more burst , and we 'll be fried like southern chicken . Send a grounded z-pulse through the electrical , then run diagnostics on the echo . Configure the kickback waves to resonate at that frequency . Let 's make him eat his own farts . Brilliant , sir , but slightly off-putting . Eat it , St. Cloud ! Fools . Will you never learn ? While you wasted your efforts on a harmless monster truck , I had all the time in the world to steal this from you . - No ! The holy of holies . - The source of all our power . You won 't get away with it , St. Cloud . I just did , Billy . Oh , boo . It 'll be too late to stop me by the time you find my mountain hideaway . So ... maybe next year . Maybe no go . - To the Conjectu-craft ! - Uh , hey , uh , I have a teeth-cleaning appointment first thing in the morning . Hey , can we do this tomorrow ? Like 10 : 00 , 10 : 30 ? Well ... I do a bunch of things I flaked on , so I 'm down for that . Okay , no , that 's cool . I-I didn 't really sleep well last night . Okay . So , uh ... I will get you , Quizboy ... at a reasonable hour . 6x02 - " Maybe No Go " - Wait ... is that a ... piece ? - Huh ? Piece of what ? No , I mean a gun . I was attempting to use the vernacular of the streets ... trying out New York rusty . Well , that really worked out for you . Yeah , strict O.S.I. policy . Congratulations , doc , you 're a top-level client . What is this , decaf ? It tastes like old puddle . It 's cafix . I 've nervous bowels , and I thought ... Ah . Thank you , Helper . Uh , what happened to jBot ? Well , hello , handsome . Look who 's on the front page again , Brock . " C-E-Oh-no . Second Venture son drives stocks into the ground . " - Do you have any real coffee ? - What ? I 'm mixing things up . Gettin ' slappy with this little company my brother trusted me with . No reason for stockholders to jump ship . You fired everybody and started spending . Can you blame them ? I 've big plans for Ven-whatever . But fine . I don 't need a mutiny because people can 't post a picture of their lunch on tweet-tweet or whatever . Where 's that idiot Pirate ? I 'm sure he knows how to fix this . Trust me , you don 't want him . He 's back on tranque . I ... don 't want to know what that is . I 'm going out for coffee . Yeah , this grain beverage isn 't cutting it . I 'd rather irritate my bowels . Get me a coffee , too ! And a Pirate . No . I-I ... Double no ! Extra no ! Cherry-on-top , gold-plated no ! - Also ... no . - Sweetie , it 's not a request . It 's a political and tactical move for the Guild . - You can 't arch Dr. Venture . - But if we ... This Guild thing was supposed to be for our own good ! And now you 're stabbing me in the wings ! Once we get the Guild back on its feet , you can arch Dr. Venture later . We 'll bump up your low arching level and file for some ... - Wait ... low arching level ? - Wait ... what level are we at now ? On the books , y-you 're a 6 . But that was when you had over 100 henchmen and a flying cocoon . So if I were to reassess , I 'd go with 3 , maybe 4 . 3 or 4 ? ! Come on ! Tantrum Rex is a level 4 . Tantrum Rex ! He looks like that " not the mama , not the mama " baby-dinosaur puppet . - Right , you know that if we want t ... - It 's not just the arching level . There are like a dozen villains ahead of you . Venture is top dog now . Will you just trust me ? I 'm on your team . Why can 't you see that ? Oh , I don 't know . Because you 're in a Guild jacket , maybe ? - Yeah , but if you just ... just ... - I haven 't unpacked my bathrobe . - See ? - That 's , like , inappropriate . There is no way I could stay mad at that . I 've 10 minutes before I leave for assembly . - Make-up sex ? - Only if you bump up my level . - And wear the cheerleader outfit ? - Deal . All right , you guys suck . Meeting adjourned . Way to be totally unprofessional . Hold on , pookums . I forgot something in the kitchen . Get into her files and get us a list of who 's ahead of me for arching Venture . I want names , addresses , schedules , strengths , weaknesses ... the works . - You have five minutes . - Five minutes ? I need more time . She 's putting on the cheerleader outfit ! I can 't last more than five minutes . I know ... I 'll pretend I can 't find the cleanup towel and leave her caked in my sticky triumph for a few minutes . - Will that help ? - I hate that you tell me this stuff . Oh , look at this here dangerous situation ! That beastie is a man-eater ! Ye better dart that mighty bear ! And ... And I 'd dart the Pirate , as well ... for safety ! Dart me for safety ! Do not approach the bear . We are going to subdue it . Hey , hey , hey , don 't bogart me fix ! Ohhh ! There you are , me little whore ! Just get on your knees and give the Pirate what he wants . Dude , why are you complicating this ? Why don 't we just fly in and storm his estate with lasers blazing ? One , we don 't have lasers to blaze . Two , I just repaired the Conjectu-craft - from the last time we did that . - Ugh . Fine . All right , park it . You 're wasting ionized phosphates . We really need to put wheels on that or something . I 'll use my Quizboy grappling hand ! That 's it ? It doesn 't pull you up ? Where would I hide the pneumatic gears for that ? My arm would be all huge , like " the man whose arms exploded guy . " - Just climb it . - Ugh . That was the single most frightening thing ever aired on TV . Ow ! Ah ! O-Oh ! Dude , stop ! Let go ! Stop ! - What ? - That kills ! - This thing is attached to my nerves ! - Great design , Billy . Ehh . I can 't get my hand off this thing . White , what are you doing ? Yeah , hey , it 's Conjectural Technologies . Can you capture us already ? - Ta-da . We 're in . - Conjectural Technologies ! Here 's your coffee , black , and a Pirate , unconscious . Look at him ! Ugh ! Get him out of the living room ! He smells like he went to the bathroom on himself . More like he went to the bathroom on me . Oh , you 're a talented polar bear ... all up on your hind paws . Oh , hey , I 'm gonna just take a wee hit of this , Mr. Bear . That 's a real gun , idiot . Hank , go find your brother . I got a , uh , little job for you . You 're 100 % sure this is the address ? I mean , what kind of supervillain lives in Paterson , New Jersey ? - Yeah , you 're one to talk . - Please . Newark trumps Paterson . And we have a mansion ! Yeah , yeah , well , just one address for both residence and secret lair . Maybe the house is made out of a spaceship or something . What do you want ? Hello , ma 'am . I 'm just gonna cut to the chase here . My name is the Mighty Monarch . This is my henchman . Uh , # 21 ... of 1 . You are Redusa , supervillain in line to arch Dr. Venture . So if I could just get your signature stating that you waive this privilege , we 'll just be on our way . And our gratitude and this collectable Monarch pen will be your reward . I don 't know who you are , why you 're dressed like that , or who you think I am , but you 'd better get off my porch before I call the cops . - Well , that worked great . - Drag her inside . Mousse ? I didn 't even know - they made hair mousse anymore . - You had all morning . Well , you guys took so long , I thought I 'd freshen up . Pei ! Bring me my soap mitt . And don 't play stupid about the red ball . I know what it is . Yes , it 's a prop from Duran Duran 's " Is there something I should know ? " video . Sure it is , Quizboy . It 's not the source of your power or the key to human history at all . It 's just a red bouncy ball from a video . Whatevs . Hey , hey , hey , check it out . I 'm in flock of seagulls . Is that Henrietta Pussycat ? The Henrietta Pussycat from the neighborhood of make-believe ? The same . Thank you , Pei . I use her as a shower mitt . Does that bother you , Quizboy ? It 's sacrilege ! That 's a priceless artifact , and a part of our collective childhood , you monster ! Hey , look , look ! I 'm in the exploited . Mmm . She 's super-absorbent and so extra-soft . Aren 't you , Henrietta ? " Meow , meow . Yes I am . Meow , meow . " - Oh , yes , you are . - Just give us the ball ! No , I 've got this whole thing planned for the ball . I 've got a whole set made and everything ... worth the wait . What , Henrietta ? You want to wash me ... down there ? Well , by all means . Please tell me you 're not doing what I think you 're doing ! Billy , remember tool academy ? Where am I ? Hell ? Or a children 's TV show that takes place in hell ? Getting off tranquilizer darts . For this , you will need one bed ... chained to . Ladies ' shirt ... Pirate-sized . Beef-flavored tomato juice ... two jugs of . Fruit snack ... 10 feet of . Coffee cake ... crunchy part of . Picture of old people dancing . Sympathetic kitten , television , " She 's all that " DVD . One bucket for urine , one for feces , one for vomitus . Oh , and one for the kitten . All right , take a seat , son . - Krill ? Lots of omega-3 . - No . But thanks . Looks really ... are those alive ? Till I crush them in my mouth . So ... you got something for me ? Uh ... there was a-a thing . Hm . Do I look different to you ? Huh ? Bigger , maybe ? You know , like , uh , stronger ? No . I mean ... yeah . You 're ... you 're a very strong guy . You 've always been strong . Oh , funny . I-I can lift this without any effort . Maybe all them beachbody DVDs are finally paying off . Because this can 't be lighter than usual . You 'd never do that to me , would you ? So it 's me , right ? It 's Venture . He refused our protection . I-If he doesn 't pay us , we can 't pay you . He refused your protection ? Does he understand what that means ? ! Okay ! Well ... let 's see if the good ship Venture is a strong and mighty vessel . She 's going on a nantucket sleigh ride . She 's coming to . So , are you gonna kill her ? Me ? ! I 'm not gonna kill her . Nobody 's gonna kill her ! We 're gonna just be more persuasive . Oh , yeah , I 'll just offer her another free pen . How could she refuuuuse a free pen ? I was thinking on my feet . Come on ! Well , now that you have experienced the power of the mighty Monarch , - Oh , where am I ? - Let 's have that signature , huh , Redusa . - What the ... - Drop ! Kiss my ass ! That 's really ironical . Ohhhh . Okay , I get her name now . - Don 't look at her ! - Like that 's a problem . She 's repulsive . I 've seen " Clash of the titans " enough times to know what goes next . You know , the Harry Hamlin version , obviously . Yeah ? Try it , fatty . Explain to the Guild how you , a villain , killed another villain . Dude , I have your file . You never re-upped your Guild membership . I could pop off your little head legally . Or I could leave it on your neck , you go to the Guild , and tell them you 're not interested in Venture . Look , Venture is a douche , okay ? We 're doing you a favor here . You still get to keep the free pen . Aw , pally , you 're , like , a wicked-bad pirate . I 'm a good pirate ! Piiirraaate ! No ! No , baby ! No ! No ! You 're an incompetent businessman . No , chairman ! I 'm good ! No , no ! Pirate . Pirate ! I need help with my damn company . Pirate ! - Is that his name ? Just Pirate ? - Right ? Ooh ! Can we name him ? I think " Sir Reginald von Pirate guy " is cool . He 's not a pet pirate . W-W-What is this ? - An intervention . - You know what I see ? I see a bunch of people that love you ... love you like crazy ... and they feel like they 're losing you . Eh . Is that me poop in that bucket there ? Very much so . Brock-star , this is Mr. Chin . Emergency call from Mr. Chin . Don 't do that . Drives me nuts . So fun ! Oh . I see you 're wearing the gun . Impressed . Yeah . It 's not loaded . Now I 'm double impressed . Anyway , just got wind of a level-10 arching coming your way . Are you kidding me ? Already ? - I 'm not even set up over here . - Welcome to New York . Your idiot employer didn 't pay off the local talent , so you 're gonna be taught a little lesson . - Who 's the teacher ? - Chester Ong . In the ' 80s , he worked with his brother Doug , trying to find a cure for cancer in cuttlefish DNA . You know the drill ... experiments on himself , gets all f-reaky looking , goes into villainy . He goes by " Wide Wale " these days . Okay , how fast can I get a scramble ? I need ronins , stun mines , 60 feet of laser fence , - at least ... - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! This is going down any moment , my love . You 're in this alone . Into the panic room ! Everybody ! Now ! Yes , we 're very impressed with your setup . My god ! Just give your evil speech already ! See the pyramid ? The time machine from the video ? - Yeah , I bought that . - Yes ! Just go ! This is the " Please please tell me " ball ... formed by Marc Bolan , inflated by Roxy Music , its power passed down to every new romantic band ever since . It 's a prop from an ' 80s video . Without this ball , the New Romantics could never have happened . Duran Duran would be a jock-rock band . You 're completely nuts ! It 's a red rubber ball ! Imagine ... no Spandau Ballet to write " If you leave . " John Hughes is without inspiration , forcing Molly Ringwald to remain on " The facts of life . " Her plucky charm propels the show into legend , allowing Kim Fields to successfully run for public office . So tell me , Quizboy , are you prepared for a world of jocks led by President Tootie ? - It 's a useless collectible ! - Just give us the ball , St. Cloud ! You want the ball ? Here . Take the ball . Psych ! N-No , no , seriously . Here . You can have the ball . Oh , psych ! Could you be any more lame ? Here . I was just kidding . - Ohh ! Why did you do that ? ! - I ... uh , reflex ? Reflex is a lonely child who is waiting by the park . All right , fine ! Have the ball ! - So , what do you want ? - Oh , goody . The denouement . Well , as you know , this pyramid is a portal to the old West . I 'm going to send the ball back in time . That is , unless you sell me your company , Conjectural Technologies ... for a single penny . No . We 're talking live rounds and expected casualties . You 're barely a rent-a-cop . If you want to be technical , I 'm barely a tour guide . This is a flashlight , not a gun . But I 'm all you got . All you got , sir ! Okay . Fair point . - What do you know about this Wide Wale ? - Class act . One of the Ong brothers , joined the Guild in ' 87 . Ruthless , but plays it safe . Runs with about 40 henchmen , 4 private guards , 1 valet . - Since 1995 , he 's been , uh ... - Whoa ! How do you know all this ? Brock , I used to be a supervillain , and I was in the O.S.I. I can tell you where King Gorilla used to hide his porn . All right , so , how does Wide Wale move ? Oh , submarine . He takes the old septic and drainage lines . He 'll be coming through the floor most likely ... - uh , kind of his thing . - So , what do we got , sergeant ? Well ... lobby , so , uh , all you got is the old crap you see lying around , one overweight tour guide , and your pistol , that is clearly not loaded . Went to the ZOO today . When 's the last time you went to the ZOO ? Jet-powered automated trains , conveyer belts on the streets , Plug-in replaceable kidneys ... that 's what I 'm talking about . Not this " Angry birds " nonsense my brother did . Oh , no , I get it . Ven-Tech just ain 't set up for that . Ven-Tech ? This building was my father 's . It 's built on my great-grandfather 's building . That 's the legacy ... a legacy of super science ! A legacy of looking at tomorrow like it hasn 't come yet . And when it 's here , it 'll be amazing . Yeah , but you got to live in reality , Dr. Venture . You run a corporation . You got shareholders and products what need updates . Ye got to pay the bills , Dr. Venture . Well , why can 't you do both ? - Uh , how ? - What ? Keep the public face that 's already functioning and set up a team to work on the speculative engineering . Hm . How about that ? Could work . Yeah . That could work . Nice work , Dean . Nice work . Now let 's get back to my idea . Two words ... moon circus . If there 's no New Romantics , t-then stuff like nu rock woulda happened way earlier . I mean , Linkin Park and System of a Down woulda formed in the ' 80s , and that woulda ruined future hip-hop . And with no good hip-hop , there 's no RZA . And I lost my virginity to side " A " of " Wu-tang forever . " We had to do it . Just think of what your hair would look like . Well , now we have nothing . Robo-Bo , all our inventions , our home ... all sold to St. Cloud . All we have is that stupid ball that you think is magic , - because you 're a ... a dreamer . - Well , this was your dream , too . - Yeah ... was . - White ... it is magic . Why would you doubt that ? It 's the " Please please tell me " ball . It was all worth it . We saved the world . We did . What are we gonna do now , Billy ? I don 't know . We 'll cross that bridge when we come to it . With their mortal enemies about to penetrate their secret cave , Jonas had to make his move , pouring an estimated 4 tons of liquid nitrogen into the river ... Hey , hey , yo , yo , yo ! Stop shooting ' ! Stop shooting ' ! Nobody is here . We got stood up . What do we do ? This is kind of embarrassing . Why do I feel like it 's my fault for some reason ? - Right ? Like we did something wrong . - Wait , wait . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Shhh . What is that ? Please let me direct your attention to the treasure of Churumucuo . Weighing 30 pounds of Aztec gold , this mask is considered priceless . Hey , what are you standing around for , huh ? What , are you looking for the gift shop ? Go get me that mask ! It was pretty cool . You move like a thin guy , but you 're not . You 're beefy . - Yeah , this time , I did kick ass . - Up top , my main henchman . Yeah , you think Redusa 's gonna do what we said ? No , I think she 's gonna tattle on me to my wife . We need another method . Mr. Monarch , I have to show you something . Your wife no home , so I wait for you . You 're no going to believe this . I knew you spoke [ bleep ] English ! ... and then we hit solid steel . So I sent the workers home because of this . Get all ready for nutty crazy . La-da ! I no go inside . Muy creepy . Manolo , you 're a good man , even though you lied to me about not speaking English . Now go home and do not tell anyone about this , especially my wife . Holy crap ! Get down here ! Ugh . It smells like blue cheese down here . You have got to be [ bleep ] kidding me ! He , uh , took the bait and left ? Now he 's got a Tumbaga mask that 's mostly copper . Hell of a plan , Brock . Hey , uh , how 's your back ? I can 't believe how much he weighed . I think tranquilizers make bodies weigh more . So , uh , take the cloth elevator down ? Buy you a beer ? Well , uh , still an alcoholic , but , uh ... ah , heck , I 'll just go to an extra meeting . It 's on me . One , two , three ! Yeah , well , it was like stealing lilies from a corpse , Badhul . Yeah , hauled in easily 700 grand in Aztec treasure . You shoulda been there ! Apparently , we had visitors . We have been pranked . Hi-freakin ' - larious . Hey ! Shh , shh . I hear you breathin ' . Who 's there ? Come on out here ! Good morning , Peter . Who is it ? It 's our archenemy and owner of our life . Tell him to die ! What , you come here for breakfast ? No , I 'm just here to inform you that I sold your company and your miserable hides for a considerable profit . Oh , wait ... that 's gloating , isn 't it ? Oh , well . Here 's the info . - Ta-ta , losers . Mm . - Ugh . Look at his hips . I swear that guy takes estrogen pills . Pack your bags , White . We 're going to New York City !

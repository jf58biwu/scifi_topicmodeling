 Previously on The 100 ... I am the last Natblida , heir to Bekka Pramheda , and you are my subjects . We need to increase the population in the City of Light . The more minds turned to the task , the more powerful A.L.I.E. becomes . Jaha has been chipping everyone . Jasper 's right . I 've seen it with my own eyes . Now that Arkadia has fallen , we 'll move on to stage two . What are you doing ? Stop ! Raven ... You know too much . I can 't let them have you . Raven ... Why did A.L.I.E. want you to kill yourself ? Because I know why she wants the second A.I. Why ? It 's the only thing that can stop her . You ever hear the one about the massacre on Alpha station ? - No - No ? - No . - You ? Hey . Well , listen . It ... it wasn 't long after unity day , right ? Generation one , they didn 't know that they were leaving the ground forever . Some of them lost their minds . Not listening , ok ? We got to meet the others in six hours . I need sleep . Oh , he hates ghost stories . Well , I want to hear it , so come on , Miller . Scare me . All right . There 's this one guy ... Brazilian , Captain Fidalgo . That was his name . He started to see his dead wife and kids in his dreams . They were all burned up from the bombs . He told the ship 's doc that they looked like demons . After a while , he started to see them when he was awake , too . He would beg and beg and beg them to leave him alone , just to stop , right ? They said the only way they 'd leave him alone was if he did one thing . What ? Kill . Well , like demons do . Yeah . Like demons do . His weapon of choice ... metal hook . A hook ? That 's the best you can do ? Shut up , Bryan . Let him tell it . So he murdered 11 people in one night . He gutted them and strung them up in the mess . Worst part of it , when the guards found him , he was cut into pieces , too . He wrote a single word with his own blood on the floor with the arm that he didn 't hack off ... " demons . " God , I hate you . Anyway , you know that ... that scraping sound we hear at Alpha Station sometimes ? Some say that 's Fidalgo 's ghost dragging his metal hook along the walls , begging the demons to stop , but they never do , and he 's back looking for his next victim ! Anyway ... nature calls . Listen for that hook , right ? Look . Relax , Bryan . No demons out there , just Grounders who didn 't hear the blockade was lifted . Army of chipped Arkadians . Don 't look at me . He 's your boyfriend . Oh , yeah . Kick my boyfriend 's ass . Good luck . Hey , when you guys find Captain Fidalgo , get him to chop up some more firewood , ok ? Oh , seriously , " A " for effort , Miller . Guys ? Bryan . Guys , this isn 't funny anymore . Miller . Got me . You 're hilarious . You can come back now . He ... Heda . - Heda . - For heda . Heda ! Heda . Hey , stranger , care for a bite ? Emori , what the hell are you doing here ? Cooking rats . The old vendor was brutally attacked on the road . It 's dangerous out there . Yeah . Clearly , it is . I have been looking for you ever since you were taken , and then I heard rumors of the new Heda 's handsome Skaikru Flame Keeper . I knew it had to be you . I taught you well . She 's one hell of a mark , John . I want in . Fresh caught today sir . Love one . Thank you . It 's the best . It 's the best rat I 've ever had . Do not fall behind again . Keep following this street , alley on the left , black door halfway down . I 'll get away as soon as I can . Becca 's journal is amazing . At 26 , she found a pathway to access a human mind . That same year , she had to lock up A.L.I.E. because her answer for what was wrong with the world was too many people . She was 27 when it launched the bombs . What did she write about the flame ? A.L.I.E. 2.0 . She saw it as a way to atone for her sins . She designed it to not just access a human mind , but to merge with one . It could never wipe us out because it would be one of us . She would put it in herself first , altered her genes so her body wouldn 't reject the implant . Bekka Pramheda , the first Commander . The gene therapy made her blood black , didn 't it ? - Yeah . - How did you know that ? Nightblood . That 's where it came from . Somehow it became hereditary . Luna has it . That 's why we have to find her . If she can access A.L.I.E. 2 ... She can tell us how to stop A.L.I.E. 1 . Bekka Pramheda gets her second shot at atonement . Get back to the mind pathway . If A.L.I.E. uses it to upload our minds to the City of Light , then there 's a chance my Mom 's still alive . That depends on your definition of " alive . " Eyes sharp . Weapons hot . We 're almost home . Miller , come in . Harper , you there ? Ride 's two minutes out . Good start . We left two days ago . Why haven 't they fixed the gate ? Maybe because there 's no one here to fix it . It 's like a ghost town . Miller , where the hell are you ? I don 't like this . Maybe they got chipped . If they got chipped , they 'd have been waiting for us at the cave . Maybe they saw the open gate , went in for Lincoln 's book . Maybe you should stop saying " maybe . " If they are chipped , A.L.I.E. already knows we 're coming . Let 's get his book and get the hell out of here . That 's a plan I can support . Lincoln . Close it up . Turn the rover around . We may need to get out of here quickly . Looks like they just got up and walked away . We 're in and out . Pack as much gear as you can into the rover . I 'll get the map . I 'll ... go with her . No one should be alone . You don 't want to load gear ? Not even a little . What 's the rush ? They won 't be coming back . How do you know ? A.L.I.E. ' s mission is to chip everyone . It wouldn 't make sense to return to a place she already took . Might make sense if there were someone in that place ... I.E. , you ... who could tell us stuff like that . Good point . Let 's load gear . - Hey ... - What ? Remember when you told me it ... it gets better ? This is not the same thing . You know , it 's ok to fall apart a little , Octavia . You loved him . A warrior doesn 't mourn the dead until the war is over . I 'll wait in the hall . Luna , we 're on our way . Grounder . Jasper ... Ready to prove how much you miss me ? I recognize some of this tech . Oh , let me guess . Flame Keeper was one of your customers ? Who is this ? They ... call her Bekka Pramheda . She was the first Commander . Becca . Come on . Don 't tell me you actually believe in this religious crap . Are you sure no one will come in ? Does it seem like I 'm sure ? Everyone finish what you 're doing . Meet me at the armory . Why ? What 's going on ? You 'll see when you get here . - We just got lucky . - On our way . Wait . Leave A.L.I.E. 2 . Why ? I think I know how to activate it . Without a Nightblood ? This section here codes for activation using a spoken passphrase . You can read that ? That 's ... no . How ? None of our systems are in this language , and you 're a lousy coder . Here . What phrase ? It 's doesn 't say . It could be anything . It was in Lexa , right ? She would 've known it . Lexa didn 't even know she was an A.I. She wasn 't an A.I. Her mind was just enhanced by one . I 'm guessing the reason she didn 't know was because the program degraded over time . Parts of it got lost . Think , Clarke . It might have been a phrase that meant something to Lexa , words she said over and over again . " Blood must have blood . " " Jus drein jus daun . " " Seek higher things . " Wait . Becca 's book is full of Latin phrases . I take it A.L.I.E. didn 't leave Latin behind in your brain . I studied some Latin . " Seek higher things . " " Altiora ... petimus . " No . Go for less literal translation . " Ascende ... Superius . " What happened ? Ascenda superius . Oh , hey , no . It 's like it sensed your mind . When someone without the blood takes the flame , the flame takes their life . Ok . There must be another way to access the code , then . There 's not . Until we find it a host , we won 't know how to stop A.L.I.E .. Then let 's find it a host . Come on . Bellamy 's waiting , and so 's Luna . Ok . We 'll catch up . So what else do you know that no one ever taught you ? Once we find Luna , this will all be over . Ontari 'll be exposed as a fraud , and the A.I. Will tell us how to shut down A.L.I.E .. If we shut down A.L.I.E. , what happens to the City of Light ? Your Mom will come back like Raven did . What about mine ? Someone 's here . Following the creepy music is a bad idea . Or we can follow the creepy music . " Aaron . " I don 't like this . We should go . Gas . Run ! - Clarke ... - Bellamy ... Clarke ... what is it ? What 's going on ? Emerson . Emori , you got to leave Polis , all right ? Hey , it 's not safe for you here . I can look after myself . Now , how the hell did you pull this off ? Well , you know me . Just doing what I can to stay alive , right ? You 're cute when you 're modest . I 'm being serious , though . Ontari , she 's crazy , and that 's coming from me . The only reason why I 'm still breathing , she thinks I know how to make her the Commander . I thought she was the Commander . Not technically . No . To be the Commander , you have to shove a computer chip into your brain . These fools think it 's reincarnation . Why would you think you could do this ? Because I saw it come out of the last Commander . Don 't ask . So what do you do for her now ? She 's taken a liking to me . Who could blame her ? Go . What ? Heda requires your presence , Flame Keeper . Of course she does . Thank you . So important . I got to go . Stay here , ok ? You 'll be safe . Where 's Monty ? Emerson took him . Why ? Octavia , can you hear me ? Come in . Jasper was with her . Jasper , are you there ? Say something . Miller , Harper , Bryan . This is all my fault . I let Emerson live . What are you talking about ? In Polis , I had a chance to kill him , and I let him go . Bellamy , what 's wrong ? Raven , are you ok ? Where are you ? Still in engineering . We 're fine . Raven , listen to me . Emerson is here . Are the others with you ? Negative . Just Sinclair . Mount Weather Emerson ? Yes . Ok . Lock down the hangar bay . Don 't let anyone in but us . Ok . Stay here . I 'll lock the doors . Is this guy Emerson chipped ? He wasn 't as of yesterday . He wants revenge . Raven ... He 's here . He 's inside the hangar bay . Raven , I 'm coming . Open the hangar door ! He cut the power , so do it manually . - Raven ! - Raven ! The outer door . Raven , get back in the rover ! Lock the door ! No . No , no , no , no . Please stay in the rover . Stay in the rover , please . Stay in the rover . Stay ... stay in the rover . Stay ... stay in the rover . Stay in the rover . I 'm gonna get you out of here . No . It 's ok . It 's ok . It 's ok . Stay in the rover . Stay in the rover . Just go back , please . Please go back . Go back . I 'm gonna get you out of here . No , no . Stay ... stay in the rover . Stay in the rover . Stay in the rover . Stay ... Raven . Sinclair . Raven . After me . Sinclair . We 're too late . No , we 're not . He didn 't kill Monty or Raven . He would have left their bodies . He took them somewhere . If you 're right , Octavia and the others are there , too . Where would he be taking them ? They could be anywhere . Does he even know his way around ? He was here . You were in Mount Weather . The airlock . Emerson , I know you 're listening . We need to talk . I don 't need to do anything . You should 've killed me when you had the chance . And now you 're here to kill me . Is that it ? Something like that . Then let my friends go . Do that , and you can have me . You 're brave , Clarke . Clarke ... I 'll give you that . I know what I 'm doing . They 're lucky to have a friend like you . Come to the airlock , no weapons , right now . Here . What the hell are you doing ? Saving them . Look . When it 's over , take this to Luna . Raven 'll know what to do with it . Promise me . No . You 're out of your mind if you think I 'm letting you do this alone . Bellamy , this is my fault . I 'm not letting anyone else die for my mistake , ok , so take it . You through ? I don 't know what happened between you and Emerson in Polis , but I do know that letting him kill you here today is a stupid plan . You got a better one ? Distract him . I shoot him . Commander 's decision is final . - Thank you . - Thank you , Heda . You 're next . Come on . Step forward . Spit it out . What do you want ? Only to give you what you need . You son of a bitch . Hello , John . You 've done well for yourself , I see . Who is this ? Your Flame Keeper and I are old friends . Friends . You know , I don 't know what you 're doing here , Jaha , but if I were you , I 'd leave while I still can . You don 't have to be a false Commander . Clear the room . How do you know that ? You told me ... He 's lying . Obviously , you should kill him right now for insulting you . Just as you told me you would be unable to perform the ascension ritual , even if you had the flame . You ? You took the chip . This is the girl from the market . You acted as if you didn 't know her . I 'm his lover . Really ? Ontari , listen to me . You cannot trust these people . Seems the only person I can 't trust is you . I told you what would happen if you betrayed me . You kill him , I won 't help you . Why ? He 's a fraud , but he does have knowledge that could be useful to all of us . Trust me . Arrest this imposter . Ontari , listen to me , ok ? Nothing this man says is the truth , ok ? You can 't believe ... let go of me . Jaha ! Listen to me . Ontari , you can 't believe anything ... Don 't take anything ... No ! No ! You 're ruling without the wisdom of the Commander 's Spirit . Your people will soon figure that out . I can offer you something even more powerful than the flame ... True legacy of Bekka Pramheda , all power , all wisdom contained in one simple key . All you have to do is swallow it . I held up my part of the deal . Your turn . Let my friends go . Tell Bellamy to show himself first . I don 't know what you 're talk ... No . Good . Now take out the clip . Throw it down the hall . Put the gun on the ground and get inside . Please . You wanted me . I 'll get inside once you let them go . I was talking to Bellamy . Ok , ok . Just ... just stop . Bellamy , don 't . Those are yours . Get on your knees , Clarke . Put your hands behind your head . No . You can do anything you want with me , ok ? Just let them go . You murdered 381 people . You took the lives of my children , my brother , my friends . Did you really think that I would be happy with just one life in return ? Airlock 5 , oxygen venting . Airlock 5 , oxygen venting . Now you 're gonna feel what I felt . Beg me to stop it . I told you to beg ! - I 'm begging you . - Louder ! Please ! Bellamy ... Aaron wouldn 't want you to do this . You don 't say his name ! No ... Not yet . First , you 'll watch them die . You have any last words for your friends ? Yeah . Ascende superius . What ... No . No . May we meet again . Your fight is over . Yu gonplei ste odon . ( Your fight is over ) Yu gonplei ste odon . ( Your fight is over ) It 's time to go . I 'll get the map . Hey , we 're leaving . Why aren 't you ready ? We 're not going with you . Raven ... He can barely walk , and my shoulder 's killing me . My brain 's all kinds of awesome . She remembered that A.L.I.E. downloaded herself into the Ark mainframe . If the code is still there , we might be able to find a back door . I 'm guessing once you connect A.L.I.E. 2 to Luna , we 'll need to access A.L.I.E. 1 to take her down . Miller . We 'll keep them safe . I 'll keep them safe . How about you ? It 's gonna be dangerous . You know me well . I 'm in . Ok . The gates to Polis are open . Thank you , Emori . It 's time to fill the City of Light .

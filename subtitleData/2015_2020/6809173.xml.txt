Mommy , I want to give Anita a good-night kiss . I 'm sorry , Laura . I 'm fully qualified in first aid . Mommy , I want to give Anita a good-night kiss . I prioritized the risk to Sophie 's safety . Mommy , I want to give Anita a good-night kiss . Sophie , you silly girl . Mommy , I want to give Anita a good-night kiss . You know you 're supposed to be careful around the oven . Mommy , I want to give Anita a good-night kiss . Bed , now ! Mommy , I want to give Anita a good-night kiss . Have these machines devalued human existence ? The best reason for making machines more like people is to make people less like machines . The woman in China who works 11 hours a day stitching footballs . The boy in Bangladesh inhaling poison as he breaks up a ship for scrap . The miner in Bolivia risking death every time he goes to work . They can all be part of the past . Synthetic devices free people . We 've treated people like machines for too long . It 's time to liberate their minds , their bodies to think , to feel , to be more human . But a lot of people would argue that work is a human right . If anything , the hard work gives you a sense of self-worth . I think you should spend one week working in a microchip facility . So we 're all going to be poets or something ? What a load of crap . Oi , slagchops , I 'm watching that . Watch it in your room , knobcock . All right , both of you to your rooms . - Seriously ? - Now . We 're not 12 . - Why do you always have to do this ? - Do what ? You just ruin everything . I think the back door just opened . If Mattie 's smoking again ... Then you 'll have a screaming row and she 'll smoke somewhere else for a bit . Fingers crossed it 's only burglars . Anita , you need to stay inside after we go to bed . - Is that clear ? - Of course , Laura . Anita , you need to stay inside after we go to bed . I 'm sorry . Anita , you need to stay inside after we go to bed . The moon is beautiful tonight , don 't you think ? They 're not supposed to ask questions like that . They 're not supposed to have accidents either . They 're not supposed to ask questions like that . Are they ? They 're not supposed to ask questions like that . We 're not taking it back . Should we be afraid of our synthetics ? Hundreds of millions operational across the world Should we be afraid of our synthetics ? and not one single verified instance Should we be afraid of our synthetics ? of a Synth knowingly injuring a human . Should we be afraid of our synthetics ? Their sole purpose is to make our lives better . They aren 't sentient . They don 't have any thought , Their sole purpose is to make our lives better . emotion or awareness . Their sole purpose is to make our lives better . The Asimov blocks in their programming mean that they simply aren 't able to do us any harm . The Asimov blocks in their programming What if you can 't find her ? I will find her , Maxie . Because I love her . I will find her , Maxie . And she loves me . I will find her , Maxie . But do you believe that one day we will have a truly artificially intelligent Synth , But do you believe that one day one that thinks and feels like a human ? But do you believe that one day How can we replicate something we hardly understand in ourselves ? But do you believe that one day How would we even know if we succeeded ? But do you believe that one day But you admit it 's something you 're working towards ? But do you believe that one day Think of the problems to solve before we get there . But do you believe that one day What is human emotion ? For example , what is love ? What is human emotion ? Is it something we are born with ? Or can it be learned ? Is it something we are born with ? Is it something we are born with ? Panties down , not off . Is it something we are born with ? And what about the darker feelings ? Is it something we are born with ? Fear , anger , violence . Is it something we are born with ? Human consciousness is not complete without them . Is it something we are born with ? And memory , ours are subjective , fallible . Is it something we are born with ? But how do you teach a computer to forget ? Is it something we are born with ? Or to dream ? It 's something our minds need to do . Or to dream ? Would a conscious Synth have to be able to dream ? Or to dream ? To have nightmares ? Or to dream ? Of course not . They 're just machines . Of course not .

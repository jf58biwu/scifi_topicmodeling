 [ both laughing ] Huh ? [ suspenseful music playing ] We 're under attack ! To battle stations ! Ezor , find the leader . Narti , Zethrid , take prisoners . Kill no one . [ grunts ] [ indistinct whispering ] Huh ? - [ screams ] - [ grunts ] [ meows ] [ panting ] [ all grunt ] [ snarling ] - [ gasps ] - [ grunting ] - [ snarling ] - [ grunting ] [ grunts , groans ] [ groans ] What 's this ? Some sort of communicator ? You weren 't trying to call for help , were you ? Prince Lotor would not like that . [ grunting ] [ weapons whirring ] [ grunts ] Mnh-mnh-mnh . [ sighs ] - Who-- ? Who are you ? - You dare speak to Prince Lotor ? Now , Auxia , that 's no way to treat our new ally . - Let him continue . - We will not be enslaved again . - We are free . - According to whom ? Your savior , Voltron ? And where is your precious protector now ? Gone . Leaving you with nothing but a hollow promise of freedom . And now you must answer for what you 've done . [ gasps ] Please , spare my people . Show them mercy . Mercy has never been the way of the Galra ... until now . [ gasps ] How would you like to become a valuable part of the new Empire ? Join us ... and you 'll never need Voltron again . Smile ! We 're a team now . I wish Shiro were here to tell us how to go on without him . Allura , when we came here , you told me I would fly the Green Lion , and I thought there was no way . But then , I found it and I flew it . And then , Hunk flew the Yellow Lion , and he 's not even a pilot . In fact , you told everyone who would pilot which lion . Yeah , how did you do that ? Did we ever find out how you did that ? - Can you do that now ? - Sadly , no . When you arrived at the Castle , I immediately recognized the special qualities in each of you . But I don 't know how to search the entire universe for a new paladin . Keith , you piloted the Black Lion when you had to save Shiro . Perhaps you 're the one . Keith would be the worst leader of Voltron . Yeah , we all have our thing . Keith 's the loner . I 'm the brain . Hunk 's the nice one . Allura 's the decision maker . Coran 's the wise old guy . And Lance is the goofball . Mm-hmm . Yeah , exactly . Totally right- - Wait a minute . I 'm not a goofball ! I 'm like the cool ninja sharpshooter . [ scoffs ] Are you joking ? I 'm being completely serious when I say , I do not want you to lead me anywhere . I don 't want to be the leader ! That 's just what Shiro wanted ! - What are you talking about ? - Nothing . Shiro wanted you to be his successor , didn 't he ? Well , I never heard Shiro say that , and how convenient that you 're bringing it up now , when Shiro is gone . You want the job so badly , you can have it . Now , now , hang on . I 've called the head from the very beginning . What about me ? I picked up on the radio waves that led us to Voltron in the first place . Hold your gazurgas , everyone ! It 's not our decision to make . - We must allow the lion to decide . - [ Allura ] Coran is right . We must all present ourselves to the Black Lion to see who will bear this glorious burden . - What ? You , Princess ? - My father created Voltron . How can I allow others to risk their lives in battle and not be prepared to do so myself ? I must try . - [ Hunk ] So , who goes first ? - [ Pidge ] Should we draw straws ? I have it ! I 'm thinking of a number between one and 50 ! Allura , you go first , Pidge is second , and then the others . Wait , don 't we get to guess the number ? - But I already know the number . - Allura , just go . [ takes deep breath ] Hmm ... Mm ... I wonder if I can adjust the seat . Nope . Not it . What are you doing ? You didn 't even try . Yes , I did . I sat down . I don 't want to leave the Yellow Lion , okay ? I mean , it 's big , it 's got this super armor , it 's safe . But you called the head . Yeah , I know . I wanted to form the head with the Yellow Lion . Fine . Pidge , go right ! Lance , go left ! Keith , make me a sandwich , stat ! Yes , you heard me . I 'm the leader now , dang it ! All right , you 're not the one . Out of the lion . All right ! Now , I 'll form the head . [ grunts ] [ grunting ] [ groans ] [ sighs ] Okay , you can do it . This is your moment . [ Pidge ] So , how long are we gonna let Lance sit in there ? [ Hunk ] Yeah , it 's been like half a varga . It 's useless . The Black Lion hates all of us . Keith , the Black Lion hasn 't responded to any of us . You have to try . [ sighs ] I know you wanted this for me , Shiro . But I 'm not you . I can 't lead them like you . [ gasps ] Please , no . [ roars ] I 'm proud of you , Keith . I wish you were getting the job under better circumstances , but congratulations . - Congratulations , Keith . - Yeah , man , ditto . No , I don 't accept this . [ all gasp ] You must . The Black Lion has chosen you . I can 't replace Shiro ! You guys were right . I 'm the loner . I 'm not the leader Shiro thought I was . - [ gasps ] - Keith , no one can replace Shiro . But the Black Lion wouldn 't choose anybody it didn 't feel was worthy to lead Voltron . I respect its choice . And you should too . [ Keith ] But who 's gonna fly the Red Lion ? I want to carry on my father 's fight , but I need your help . Allow me to follow in his footsteps as your paladin . Please , I must do this . Others are risking their lives in this fight and I can 't continue to- - [ crying ] I 'm sorry , Princess . I know how much you wanted to pilot the Red Lion . I 'm fine . Let 's move on . We must find a new paladin ... again . [ Ezor ] The poor little Blade of Marmora 's defenses are spread so thin , they cannot defend any of the insurgent planets . And what about their rebellion ? Crushed . As for the whereabouts of the Voltron Lions , we 've had reports of yellow and blue in the Paglium quadrant . The red one has been seen throughout these quadrants . And the green one here , here and here . No Black Lion ? We 've questioned the planet 's inhabitants . No one has seen it . It 's like it just vanished . Poof ! No Black Lion , no Voltron . Narti , go to planet Puig and speak with their leader . [ growling ] A new paladin ? I mean , where would we even start looking ? Well , I vote for getting some alien diversity on the team , and I know some cool mermaids who could be good at it . - You just want to see them again . - Yeah , exactly . - How about those Blade guys ? - Or the Olkari . [ static ] Voltron , we need your help . The Galrans have returned . Once you left , we were defenseless . My people are trying to hold out , but the Galra are too powerful . The lions are on their way . Hold your ground and protect your people until we arrive . Voltron stands with you . Thank you , Princess . [ beeping ] [ beeping continues ] [ Allura ] Keith . The Black Lion has chosen you . You can do this . This one 's for you , Shiro . All right , guys , we 're not about to let the Galra take back this planet , so follow me . - Where 's Lance ? - What ? [ Keith ] Lance , where are you ? [ groans ] My lion 's not responding to me . [ Keith ] Well , figure it out and catch up with us as soon as you can . Attention , Paladins of Voltron . This is Prince Lotor , son of Zarkon , Emperor Pro Tem of the Galra Empire . Surrender now , or you will be destroyed . We 've been set up ! [ Keith ] Evasive maneuvers ! Everyone , watch your back ! Coran , we have to get there immediately . Lance , we need you . The lions are being attacked . - [ Lance ] I 'm trying ! - I 'm going to see what 's keeping him . Come on , Old Blue . It 's me , Lancey Lance . Open up . Okay , enough goofing around . I mean it . We gotta get out there and help the others . Oh , come on ! Why are you being mad at me ? [ groans ] Wait , do you hate me now ? I 'm sorry for wanting to fly the Black Lion . It was just a phase . Hey , Blue , you know what ? I gotta say , that 's a great color on you . Oh ! Are you from outer space ? Because your body is out of this world . [ groans ] Jeez , that 's , like , my best line . Hey ! It 's the black kitty ! So , it survived . Where are the others ? Send out the rest of the fighters . Let 's see if we can draw them out . [ screaming ] Pidge , behind you ! [ growling ] I hope your super armor holds up , buddy boy . Where 's Keith ? [ Keith ] Guys , I 'm having trouble here . These controls don 't respond like the Red Lion 's . I need some help . [ Hunk ] There 's too many for the three of us . - [ Pidge ] Look out ! - [ Keith ] Lance , get out here now ! - Lance , what 's wrong ? - I don 't know . Blue is shutting me out . Maybe Pidge was right . I am just a goofball . Not only am I not meant to be the leader , I guess ... I guess now I 'm not even meant to be a paladin . [ lion roaring ] What was that ? It 's the Red Lion . You must go to it . No way . Keith probably trained it to bite my head off . Maybe it 's roaring for you . I would love nothing more than for that to be true , but I know the Red Lion is not meant for me . - It is choosing you . - I don 't understand . [ Allura ] My father built Voltron , but he knew Zarkon was a better leader in battle , so he became Voltron 's right hand . Lance , when you accepted Keith as the new leader of Voltron , it proved that you value a strong team over your own need for glory . Just like my father . I won 't let him down . Go . Huh ? [ growling ] [ Ezor ] There 's still only three . Where 's the rest of the party ? Let 's turn up the heat and see who comes to help . Zethrid , use the ion cannon to shoot the Black Lion . Why the black one ? There 's something different about that lion . Its pilot isn 't in control . And , Zethrid , just graze it . We don 't want any permanent damage . Fine . - Keith , what should we do ? - We need to attack the ship . Can you be more specific ? We need an actual plan . [ grunting ] [ Pidge ] Keith ! [ ragged breathing ] I 'm okay , but we can 't fight this guy alone . You won 't have to . Aha . Now , we 're getting somewhere . - What was that ? - It 's the Altean ship . [ Coran ] Need some help ? Thanks , Coran . Zethrid , this is the moment you 've been waiting for . Fire on the Altean ship with everything you have . Yes , sir ! If there 's anyone else in there , this should bring them out . All right , let 's see if we can turn our attention on that ship . [ grunts ] Whoo-hoo ! Boy , this lion can move ! [ cheering , grunting ] - Hey ! Be careful with Red . - Oh , fly your own lion , Keith . [ screams ] - I meant to do that ! - [ Pidge ] Wow , we 're really kind of a mess . We need to get organized . Keith , what should we do ? I don 't know . We need to form Voltron , but we 're short a lion . - [ Allura ] Not anymore . - Huh ? [ roars ] - [ Pidge ] Allura ? - [ Hunk ] Yes ! Awesome ! Ooh ! Look , there are five kitties now . What are your orders , sir ? Should we fire on the lions ? No , we 've seen enough . Retreat . We did it ! I mean , it was a little touch and go there for a second , but , yeah , we made it . Allura , you and the Blue Lion ? How cool is that ? Yes . It was a bit of a surprise , but a happy one . Now , we know that Zarkon has a son . - This is ... deeply disturbing . - We need to find out more . Well , Old Blue , we sure had some fun adventures , didn 't we ? I wanted to stay with you , but , sometimes , what we want isn 't necessarily what we get . - I 'm gonna miss you , buddy . - [ door opening , closing ] Pink , huh ? Not what I was expecting , but I like it . Yes . On Altea , we wear this color to honor our fallen warriors . I wear it to honor the paladins of old . And Shiro . This belongs to you now . If I had to lose Blue to someone , I 'm glad it was you . [ Coran ] Princess ! The Black Lion is leaving the Castle ! - Keith , where are you going ? - I put a tracker on Lotor 's ship . [ beeping ] [ Keith ] Tell everyone to get their lions . We 're going after ' em . You wanted me to lead Voltron ? This is how I lead .

 ♪ ♪ Welcome to the stitchers program . We work for a secret government agency that hacks into the brains of corpses and reads their memories . Maggie : His name was ed Clark . Why 'd he kill himself ? He didn 't and he wasn 't my father . All right stitching affects you . Makes you different for a little bit . It doesn 't always last . You hooked up with Linus ? Thought we had each other 's backs . I had heart surgery . Kirsten : My father stitching me into my mother killed her . Cameron ? I see barbiero . He 's on a call with a woman . You 're using me to send a message to the girl ? Kirsten : He was told things that I was meant to hear and then he was killed . Black sedan . Can 't make out the plates . Cameron . Cameron : That memory is inside my head . You 're gonna go in and find it . There 's one problem . You 're not dead . I can fix that . Guys ... You got four minutes . you 're coming with me ! ( Whirring ) but it 's all blurry ! It 's useless ! Is this what love is ? I 'm everywhere . - What 's your name ? - Kirsten . I 'm Cameron . let 's go ! ( Thump ) Cameron ! - ( Thump ) - ( Flatline ) ( Flatline continues ) Clear ! - ( Thump ) - ( Beeping ) - Cameron ! - ( Flatline ) - Clear ! - ( Thump ) ( Flatline ) - Clear ! - ( Thump ) ( Beeping ) time please . time . 17 : 31 . No ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? - Shock him again ! - Kirsten ... Shock him again ! He is not dead . I can feel it . He wants to come back . please just shock him again . - Shock him . - Do it . Clear ! no . ( Whimpers ) no . Cameron ! No ! No ! Please ! ( Sobs ) Please ! Cameron ! ( Sobs ) No . ( Sobs ) ( Gasps ) Cameron ? Cameron ? I can 't believe this . Please ... Tell me you got the license plate number . I didn 't . ( Sobs ) that 's too bad ... 'Cause I 'm not doing this again . It 's okay . - ( Chuckles ) - Cameron . ( Theme music playing ) ♪ Take me inside ♪ ♪ take me inside ♪ ( Blipping ) ( Door opens ) How 's he doing ? He 's fine . Good . I 'm gonna kill him . The real question 's how are you doing ? You know me . I thought I did . That 's why I 'm asking . I think I was just a little overwhelmed . that 's understandable ... Except we 're talking about you here . Cameron : Keep it down . Trying to rest in peace . Hey . tough guy ? 100 % . ( Chuckles ) How 's Fisher ? He 's out of danger . He 's gonna be fine . Cameron ? Do you remember anything from the stitch ? um ... An angel and I was a ... hero . ( Chuckles ) What 'd you see when you were in my head ? may I see you in the hallway ? I want to hear . okay . ( Door closes ) What 'd you see ? Is this what love is ? Intense connection and then heartbreaking loss ? Thank you ... For not being a nobody . I saw ... It can wait . Camille : That was probably the most awful experience of my life . I know . did you see her when Cameron revived ? I 've never seen her like that . Have you ? Never ! you know ... How do I even say it without sounding mean ? Ugh ... emotionally reserved ? emotionally inaccessible . Bitchy . But now she 's completely different . She cried . you saw it . soppy tears . That wasn 't residual emotion . That was real emotion ! I hope it lasts . ( Sighs ) she 's not the only one who 's changed . Why ? What do you mean by that ? I 've been a jerk . no . I ... I have . I was gonna agree with you . I don 't know what 's gotten into me the past couple of days . Cameron was right about you . You did a great job during the stitch . Much better than I would 've . ( Exhales ) Linus . Everyday I deal with life and death and then I go back to the same bedroom in my parents ' house that I grew up in . how does that even make sense ? Yeah . ( Chuckles ) It 's time I grew up . you could be feeling this way because of what happened to Cameron . Sleep on it . Who knows ? You could feel differently tomorrow . I hope not . Maggie : How could you let Cameron do that to himself ? I only agreed with him . It wasn 't like I stuck the damn needle in his arm . Maggie ... Yesterday was a hard day on all of us . Why don 't you go home ? Take the day off . figure out where this threat to our program is coming from . you are the biggest threat to the team . Easy now . I am the director of the program that employs you . I asked you what I should tell Kirsten when she asks me what the real purpose of the stitchers program is . Do you remember what you told me ? I said you should tell her whatever you want as long as it 's not the truth . Why can 't she know ? Why can 't they all know ? That we are developing a technology to accelerate the evolution of the human brain ? les ? I know it 's something . What is it ? You took Fisher off the ed Clark investigation . Why ? Was he getting close to something ? I think we 're done here . didn 't you ? Just because you hang out with kids all day doesn 't mean we 're playing a game . I 'm asking you again ! Did you kill ed Clark ? Saving the world is a messy business . People get hurt . Some get killed . How many people are you willing to kill to save six billion ? I don 't know . I would kill one to save 19 . that 's the number of people in your lab . Who 's the one you 'd kill to save them ? ( Door rattling ) sunshine ! what ... how are you feeling ? I feel great ! doctor said I 'm good to go . Apparently death agrees with me . You okay ? Yeah . she 's not . Go ahead . Tell him . Tell him what ? She 's been feeling a little emotionally raw since the last stitch . Cameron : Emotions ? As in those things you don 't normally feel ? Mm-hmm . I would like to talk to Cameron . And Fisher wants to talk to you . He 's awake . some people will do anything to avoid having to be with a friend . I didn 't know we were friends . shut up . We all know you 're crazy about me . thanks for pushing me out of the way at the restaurant . Kirsten . les Turner ordered me to stop looking into ed Clark 's murder . Why did he do that ? I think because I was getting too close to the truth . I think Turner killed ed . Son of a bitch . Stay with Fisher . What ? Kirsten ! Turner ! - ( Alarm blaring ) - Kirsten : Okay . I know the way into my own lab . admiral . I 'll take it from here . stretch ? Still freaked out about Turner getting killed . everyone is . Look at this place . It 's like union station during rush hour . I like to pack heat ... there 's more of them ? First Fisher and now Turner . Looks like the NSA isn 't taking any chances with the rest of us . Just because you 're the guy in the black jumpsuit doesn 't mean I have to explain mind map anomalies to you . That 's exactly why you should explain them to me . everything okay ? The head of the stitchers program just got murdered . There 's something very wonky about his mind map that I cannot figure out and I 've got a high school dropout here who wants me to explain it to him . A heavily armed high school dropout . You must be Clark ... The one who strips and gets in the water . I see that you have met captain stamperson . NSA has assigned a captain and his men as our new security detail . He 's asking a lot of questions . and imperative to know . but this facility is under my authority until a new director is appointed and I am told otherwise . Maggie ? but this ... There was no sign of forced entry so it 's likely he knew his killer . You okay to do this ? Sure . Why are you asking ? We 're worried you may be more emotionally vulnerable in the stitch right now . Because of what happened to Turner ? Linus : That ... And because you had a complete meltdown yesterday . That 's why we want you to try something . I had just gotten used to the catwoman suit . but there was some more push back . This is the rev 2 . We 've been prototyping it since marta 's accident . but reinforced with padding and kevlar panels . Kevlar ? you used to come out you 've been starting to really feel them . Okay . how is this suit gonna protect me ? It 's simple psychology . How do you feel ? slightly badass . Then it 's working . The knowledge that you 're wearing so then you 'll be stronger . why don 't you come with me ? um ... What 'd you want to tell me at the hospital ? ( Alarm chimes ) It can wait . but ... I didn 't believe it . So ... She can see his memories ? Maggie : It 's called stitching . Does she have to eat his brain ? What ? No ! Ugh . She 's not a zombie . This is science . Thank god . everyone listen up . he got us where we are today . let 's bring our " a " game . Lights to 20 % . no-go for stitch neurosync . - Life-sci ? - Go . - Sub-bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . two . I hear you . please . ( Sighs ) Here we go . hal . That 's from 2001 . He watched a lot of movies when he was a kid . Induce stitch neurosync on my mark . one ... Mark . ( Whirring ) I 'm in Turner 's apartment . ( Indistinct chatter ) There 's something seriously wrong here . Describe it . Turner 's memory is a mess . - It 's like it ... - ( Crashing ) Exploded from the center of his consciousness . It 's making me really dizzy . Linus ? His mind map is completely fragmented . - Can you defrag it ? - I don 't know . how are you holding up ? You wanna bounce ? not yet . There 's still bits and pieces that are visible . ( Gasps ) wait . I smell something . Incense . She 's experiencing sense memory . that 's new . I really don 't feel well . I 'm bouncing . ( Whirring ) Trash can . Quick . coughs ) - She do that every time ? - No . That 's also new . the first thing we do is map his or her memories . Specific memories have a pattern . your first kiss . the first time you broke someone 's arm . goodkin . - " Dr. " goodkin . - Cameron . Anyway ... the stitchers program has cataloged over 18 million unique human experiences . The computer compares the digital signature of these experiences against the subject 's mind map as well as determining the age of the memory . That 's how we know where to move Kirsten . What do you know ? The high school dropout understood everything you said . ( Sighs ) Here 's what a normal mind map looks like ... And this is what Turner 's looks like . Cameron : Turner 's brain unfragmented his memories along all three axes . That 's why I got nauseous . I was completely disoriented . Could Turner have trained his mind to make himself unstitchable ? it 's possible . Any chance you can resort his memories ? I 'm already working on it . I wanna go to Turner 's condo . I saw something in the stitch that I want to check out . so you and Cameron go . - Okay . - Okay . go with them . we don 't need babysitting . My job is to keep you safe whether I feel like it or not . Oh . That hurts my feelings . let 's go . Try to keep up . On it . ( Whistles ) Wow . So what are we looking for ? Uh ... - ( Door closes ) - ( Radio chatter ) That . Ah . Yup . It 's a ginsburg . Still don 't see the attraction . ( Beeping ) ( Buzzes ) Okay . What 's the code ? i saw the number one ... three . ( Beeping ) ( Buzzes ) what else ? A grasshopper . I saw a grasshopper . ( Beeping ) ( Buzzes ) Officer : I 'm gonna go look around here . What 's Turner 's ancestry ? he was French Moroccan ? Sauterelle . - ( Beeping ) - It 's French for " grasshopper . ( French accent ) But of course . ( Chiming ) Turner has a panic room . Cameron : Whoa . Sacrebleu . The hard drive 's missing . Look . It 's a federal inventory control sticker . ( Shutter clicks ) But it 's hospital policy . I don 't care . I don 't want a sponge bath . Fisher . Take your bath like a good boy . ( Phone chimes ) Where are you going ? i gotta get to work . - But ... - Keep her busy . Take the frickin ' bath . honey . He 's all yours . Fine . But my safe word is " not there . ( Beep ) ( Beep ) habanero potato chip ? No thank you . - You don 't do spicy ? - I don 't do dead people 's food . Turner 's body was just here . Right . Sorry you had to see that . As if that video of your dad stitching you into your mom wasn 't bad enough . whatever crashed in my head when he did that ... right ? I think that stitching into you rebooted me . I guess it 's possible . so stitching into another live person fixed you . but you were dead . I was only mostly dead . you know . Seeing you like that . I have never been scared like that before . but scared is sometimes good ... Unless it becomes the new normal . that 's no way to live . ( Phone rings ) Camille . - Talk to us . - Okay . So thanks to an exploit I found I learned that Turner 's computer was listed as destroyed 15 years ago . - But it wasn 't . - Exactly . I went deep and I found the company that supplied found the shipping address and I 'm texting it to you now . ( Phone chirps ) Got it . Thanks . okay ? Hold it . Captain stamperson wants us to bring you back to the lab . this is going to be an excellent lesson for stamperson on not getting everything he wants . He said by any means possible . Fine . Then you can give us a hand . With what ? The computer . Obviously the computer . Yup . It 's what we came here for . and get it back to the lab . something to carry it in . chiming ) Hey ! No ! check out the testicles on Cameron 2.0 . - Thank you . - Lee : Hey ! Open the door ! - Uh-huh . - Hey ! there 's no easy access here either . This whole building 's locked tight . but not derelict . Someone 's been taking care of it . - Wait here . - Excuse me ? what are you doing ? I 'm seeing if there 's a way in through the roof . If there is ... I 'll come down and open the doors from the inside . Cameron ! Don 't get so scared all the time ! Who are you ? Are you out of your mind ? What if you fell ? so calm down . Calm down " ? " Calm down " ? I 'm beginning to miss the old Kirsten . What 's that supposed to mean ? I barely survived having one mother . I don 't need another one . I think I 'm beginning to miss the old Cameron . Whoa . What is that ? Something big was bolted down here . - ( Low buzzing ) - ( Shudders ) - Do you feel that ? - What ? Come in . ( Low buzzing ) Whoa . now I do . It 's only inside this circle . You feel that ? Yeah . um ... It 's static electricity . Where 's it coming from ? There must be something about this place that was in Turner 's hard drive . What went on in here ? Hey ! Don 't move ! guys ! We 're NSA ! Let me see your badges . Badges ? your heart can 't take being tased . We ain 't got no badges . We don 't need no badges . I ain 't gotta show you any stinkin ' badges . - ( Grunts ) - ( Clicking ) Kirsten ! - ( Grunts ) - ( Clicking ) ( Sighs ) so maybe a movie quote wasn 't the best idea at the time . Hm ... it 's fine . But you shouldn 't have jumped in front of that taser like that . You could have gotten hurt . Said the man who recently stopped his own heart . ( Chuckles ) I guess we 're even . What is going on with you ? slugging people ? I can 't help it . I can 't . I just ... I feel free . I died . I died and then I came back . I ... I get a second chance to live my life . I 'm not gonna live in fear anymore . it 's still me . Cameron ... 2.0 . Remember ? What 's your name ? Kirsten . I 'm Cameron . Kirsten . Trust me . We met when we were kids . What ? We met in the hospital . I was there . and ... You were there for your heart surgery . I have that memory ? Wow . I don 't remember much before my dad stitched me . Are you sure you don 't remember ? I was in and out of that hospital for weeks at a time . And there ... there was so many kids my age . Did we ... did we talk ? Yeah . You told me my mom was gonna be okay . Sorry I was wrong . it 's okay . You were very sweet to a scared little girl . ( Footsteps ) I am very tempted to have the two of you spend the night here making new friends in your holding cells . getting arrested ? things wouldn 't have escalated the way they did if we had badges . you mean badges like these ? Are those real ? I asked Turner for weeks to let me issue them to you . there 's no reason not to . I figure since the need to both have you in the field these will come in handy . one more thing . Just because the badge is in the shape of a shield does not mean it is one . Protect yourself . Don 't do anything stupid . guns too or ... Don 't push it . agents Clark ... And goodkin are ready to leave now . Bonnie and Clyde ! - How 's life on the outside ? - Funny . Refractory period is up . Where you at on re-sorting Turner 's memories ? Stamperson : Goodkin ! My men were in that damn panic room for an hour . You had no authority to ditch your security detail . um ... ( Blows ) This says I do . And it also gives me the authority to tell you to get the hell out of my face . - Where did you get this ? - Maggie . Any luck defragging Turner 's memory ? Yes . I 've re-indexed his memories using homogeneous coordinates . I 'm able to rotate any object in the stitch three-dimensionally . It should make Turner 's memories a more cohesive whole now . - " Should " ? - Only one way to find out . I 'm not sure that I 'm used to this new Cameron yet . Yeah . Me neither . but seriously ... Did you get a badge too ? - ( Giggles ) - How do I get one ? I think you have to get arrested first . I could so do that ! agent Carter . How is it ? ( Distorted chatter ) Still wonky . Starting scaling matrix now . ( Click ) How 's it look now ? - Same memories as before . - ( Rattling ) But better . is there a memory hot spot 15 years back ? I 'm looking ... I don 't care what happened to him 15 years ago . I want to know who killed him yesterday . The computer in Turner 's panic room was supposedly destroyed 15 years ago . Just gonna guess that has something to do with his murder . Who 's running this operation ? The smart people . Go for it . Kirsten . ( Whirring ) - ( Alarm blares ) - Do something ! ( Overlapping chatter ) Woman : Abort ! what do you see ? ( Grunts ) A pod of some kind . Now I 'm getting voices . Linus ? I 'm working on it . Man : Get her out of there ! - Man 2 : I can 't ! - Man 3 : Project grasshopper ! Shut it down ! project grasshopper was an experiment of some kind . - It failed ... - ( Quick blipping ) Heart rate 's 180 . Kirsten . I 'm moving you back towards Turner 's murder . ( Whirring ) ( Maggie and Turner 's conversation overlapping ) It 's still not clear . I 'm getting overlapping images and sounds . You 're the biggest threat to the program . Damn right I moved the asset ! It 's protocol ! I 'd kill one to save 19 . Am I the one you 'd kill ? I smell incense again . I 'm rotating the memory fragment further . She 's gonna lose her lunch again . she 's not . get the trash can . maybe she is . Just give it a sec to line up . Kirsten . You 're doing great . ( Breathes slowly ) No ! Don 't ! ( Gunshot ) you okay ? Does she see who killed Turner ? Did you see who killed Turner ? Yes . Maggie . Comtek . Now . Come on ! Here . what the hell are you talking about ? I saw you shoot Turner . Then you saw wrong . I saw you . You killed him ! you saw me in his memory but I didn 't kill Turner . I think we have some things to talk about . the stitch is still active . We have three minutes left . ( Clicking ) it was wrong . please cooperate . - No one wants things to escalate . - Maggie ! baptiste ! What 's going on ? I believe this is called a Mexican standoff . Something 's wrong with the stitch . I did not kill Turner . is there ? I ... I don 't know ! There cold be ! I am losing my Patience ! figure it out ! You got two minutes ! She 's right . There 's still time . Kirsten ? Let 's do this . Linus ? it is hard to focus with all these guns out ! try it . hot shot ? ( Whirring ) ( Crackling ) Same thing . Maggie just shot him . That never happened . replay that . Rolling back ... Wait . The pieces are still moving . They 're out of sync . What does that mean ? It means she can 't be sure Maggie was the shooter . 40 seconds . take over for Cameron . - Excuse me ? - What ? Just do it ! head to engineering ! Come on ! Move ! - ( Grunts ) - ( Humphs ) Tim . What 's going on ? Turner 's memory 's exploded into three dimensions . We need three separate controllers to realign the fragments . I 'm rerouting Turner 's mind map to all the terminals now . We need to rotate the pieces together . Okay ? Just watch the map . It 's like doing a 3-d Jigsaw puzzle . Ready ? Go ! ( Whirring ) - ( Crackling ) - Incense . - ( Beeping ) - Six seconds . make the bounce ! Well ? but I am sure it was not Maggie . ( Sighs ) - ( Sighs ) - ( Sighs ) Stand down . How 's it feel to save the day ? ( Sighs ) Doesn 't suck . that was fun . can one of you geniuses please go figure out who killed les Turner ? Hey . Things got kind of cray . How you doin ' ? Like someone out of clues . but we will figure this out . We always do . Everything that 's happened ... almost losing Cameron ... I feel like ... What ? You started a sentence with " i feel . ( Chuckles ) I 'm just still not used to that . me neither . This whole ... how do you deal with it ? Usually poorly . But I have found that homemade baked ziti with a glass or three of red wine helps put things in perspective . - ( Sighs ) - Come on . and figure out this whole emotions thing . you clean ? That 's unfair . I have seen the mess you make in a kitchen . though . ( Beeping ) ( Sighs ) - ( Alarm rings ) - Kirsten ? This readout . I saw it in Turner 's memory . It stopped at 163 . that 's here . Something on this level . Just ... just hold it . - ( Ding ) - Oh . it 's freezing . What 's Turner keeping in here ? ( Lights buzzing ) It 's not a what . It 's a who . What the hell is this place ? I was hoping one of you could tell me . - That 's ... - Ed Clark . Turner 's had him here right under our noses since his murder . Why ? Maggie : I didn 't know anything about this chamber . This is your lab ! How could you not know ? - ' Cause I didn 't . - Son of a bitch built it . You knew about this ? not exactly . Turner once asked if I could build a drug protocol to extend the shelf life of our subjects . Something about breaking the four-day limit on viability . you helped him build this ? And you didn 't tell me ? It was a theoretical conversation . I drew up some preliminary plans . I didn 't know he was gonna use them . and ed was a Guinea pig for your experiment . You told me that ed was cremated . That his ashes were sent to a distant sister somewhere . too . Turner kept this secret from all of us . So what do we do ? What I 've wanted to do since the very beginning . We stitch into ed . We have no way of knowing if his memories are even viable . Everything that 's happened to us began with Ed 's murder . It started with ed . Maybe he has answers . And nobody is going to stop me from looking for them . Ed 's memories are impossible to map . we 're gonna use the mind map that we generated the first time we stitched into ed . Is it safe ? I 'm not sure . I 'm gonna bounce you . you 're not . This stitch is mine . Fine . I 've moved you to Ed 's last available memory . How 's it look ? Not good . Your drug protocol sucks . Wait ... something 's resolving . They 're ... they 're fighting over something . I 'm not sure what . - Who 's fighting ? - Who 's fighting ? It 's ... it 's just not clear . boost glutamate and atropine level to 100 % . - You sure ? - Yes . Just do it . Linus ? increase conductivity to every sensory target zone . Ed 's memory 's gonna flame out . there 's barely anything left . brace yourself . We 're firing every synapse Ed 's got left . Can Kirsten 's mind take it ? the rev 2 suit is meant to protect you . just like the person wearing it . Alex . - ( Whirring ) go . I hope you know what you 're doin ' . Ed : You 've done enough to her ! I won 't let you ! She 's suffered so much already ! - ( Gunshot ) - ( Groans ) I smell incense again . Done ! ( Breathes heavily ) I didn 't see the killer . But I did smell incense again just like in Turner 's memory . Whoever killed ed also killed Turner . I 'm gonna increase security . You 're not going anywhere without an armed detail . - No . - You don 't get to tell me ... I do . we 're not in any danger . and it went off . That was three months ago . what about the attack on Fisher ? It was barbiero . whoever he was working for but barbiero wouldn 't listen . And Turner ? I heard something about Turner moving some asset that the killer wanted . she said that they would come for me when they think I 'm ready . - Ready for what ? - To hear the truth . So what do we do until then ? Our jobs . ( Beeping ) - ( Alarm rings ) - ( Creaking ) i didn 't know about ed . I died for you . What ... why would I lie now ? Everybody has their secrets . Camille ... Why not you ? Tell me one thing i kept from you . - Cameron . - No . You were inside my head . What secrets did you see ? I didn 't see anything . I guess you 're right . Everyone 's got their secrets . - ( Alarm rings ) - ( Elevator resumes ) dad . You missed a spot . I did ? What 's that smell ? That is sandalwood . Do you like it ?

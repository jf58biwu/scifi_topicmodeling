 In 24 hours , we will land on Mars . - But we won 't be the first . - We were crossed by your competition ? - Zillion is behind this mission . - It doesn 't make any sense . Earth hasn 't heard from them , except for one video . The ten months of travel have revealed serious neurosis in several of the crew members . We now have a rescue mission . The unhooking system seems to be failing . - What are you doing ? - I 'm going out . - We can 't leave him . - We have no choice . I can 't reboot Irene . Without a life support system , we 'll all be dead in 24 hours . Welcome to Mars . Zillion changed the world . We changed the world . In the space of 15 years , we created more services than any other company in the previous hundred . We made the impossible possible . I had a vision . A vision where each and every person on this planet would be connected to each other like never before . And that day has come . I forgot . Our future is now elsewhere . 5 years ago when I created ZSpace , people laughed at me . They 're not laughing anymore . Here is Z Explorer One . In a few months ' time , this ship will land on Mars . It 's the result of innovation . A venture that Zillion alone could accomplish . Space is set to become a land of competition , and I promise you , we 'll be first on Mars . The future is now . Are you with us ? Can he hear us ? How long does he have ? Nobody knows . Zillion 's best kept secret . But it 's spreading fast . He 's running out of time . I gave her something to make her sleep for a while . She and Martin met when they entered the Space program . Simon , you did the right thing . - So ? - We used way too much fuel . With what we have left we can 't take off and go back into orbit . - We 'll find a way later . - No , we won 't find a way later , we burned a battery during descent and we have nothing to put in the generators . If we reboot Irene now , we 'll use all our power and we 'll be dead in an hour . The only thing to do now is wait until the solar panels recharge the batteries , but with the storm we went through , the solar panels aren 't looking good . - How long ? - 48 hours . And how long can we last without Irene ? 24 hours . That sucks . One more day and we 'd be good . And we can 't boost the panels ? No , we need a battery . That 's fine , it shouldn 't take more than a couple of months to make one . There are some . On Z1 . - We don 't even know what happened to them . - You got a better idea ? - Müller ? - Yes ? I assume a geologist can tell if the ground is safe for a rover . In theory , yes . But ... No buts , you 're coming . Jeanne , get ready too . Me ? But what ... Hold on , I 'm sorry but I think you 're forgetting something . And we 're rolling . The dreams of one generation , are just the next one 's reality . The first man on Mars . The first dance on Mars . Long live the planet Mars ! Yann , can you hear me ? - Yes Simon . - If you don 't hear from us ... you know what to do . Copy that commander . What 's going on Müller ? We 're already lost ? No , of course not . I 'm just checking the route . I wasn 't prepared . Join the club . Jeanne , you 'll find water bottles and candy in the armrest , if you have a preferred itinerary , let me know . Are you going to tell me why I 'm here ? I 'm of no use to you . You said it yourself , I can 't live without you . Did you find a way ? If your girlfriend wasn 't so powerhungry , I would have a dozen ways . I 'm really sorry that the world 's most sophisticated artificial intelligence requires more power than your razor . Can 't you just launch parts of her features ? It 's all interwoven , the code 's crazy , it would take days to ... Wait . There was a power saving mode . I should be able to find it . Switch off everything we don 't use and ... Like Apollo 13 ? I don 't know , I wasn 't born yet . There 's not much left to switch off . What 's that ? I 've reconfigured the boot , can I launch ? Wait ! Go , reboot . Come on , gorgeous . Wake up . Are you okay ? How many watts can you give it ? No more than 1500 . Then we 're screwed . No more than that ! Shut it down ! Wait , it 's almost complete ! Shut it down , we 're using the backup ! Shit ! Fuck . We 're in deep shit . Basile better be able to reconfigure Irene . Or we 're going to have to be more radical . Can someone explain why there 's no light in my cabin ? Am I interrupting ? Wait . I think we 're close . Tell Meyer . He was right . We 're not the first . Must have been a hell of a storm . You think they 're dead ? I wasn 't very optimistic to begin with but ... - What about us ? - We can give up on finding the batteries . In theory the solar panels should be easier to find but ... I think that 's a long shot too . - Why ? - I think even a shrink can recognize a solar panel . Do you see any ? Let 's check out the surroundings . Can you stop doing that ? - Doing what ? - That . It 's not helping . You 're going to figure it out . I don 't have time . At that rate , I would need days . We 're all going to suffocate . And I 'm going to die a virgin . Listen kid , 2000 programmers worked on Irene 's code . And I chose to bring you to Mars . So I know you 're doing your best , and I also know you 'll crack this . But please spare me your life story , save your oxygen , and hurry up . No man has ever looked at this place . When do you plan on telling us we 're not going back ? - I 'm not sure I understand . - Don 't play dumb . You planned for this possibility , otherwise I wouldn 't be here . You don 't need a geologist or a shrink to go back to Earth . We 're the least useful . - We can be sacrificed . - Is this true ? You have a lot of imagination . And you 're a bad liar . I think I 'm going to throw up . Keep it for later . There 's a solar panel 200 yards this way . I 'm afraid we won 't get to test your theory . Don 't you feel like you 're putting pressure on me ? You speak too much . Ulysse , do you copy ? Yes Simon , tell me you 've found something . - Do you have batteries ? - No . There are no batteries . But I found a solar panel . It 's not too damaged , I think . Do you think you can hook it to the others ? Yann , can you hear me ? Batteries would have been better . That 's all I have . What about the Zillion crew ? Gone . Copy that . We 're waiting for you . Over . Stop , I see something . - What ? - Stop ! I said stop ! I think I saw someone . He 's breathing . He 's alive ! - What the hell ? - We have to get him back to Ulysse . We don 't even have enough oxygen for ourselves . We 're not leaving him . Don 't even think about it . We 're in the airlock . Get the medical unit ready . I thought there was nobody on the ship . He wasn 't on the ship . What the hell , why isn 't it opening ? - What the fuck ? - I don 't know , try again . Do something , figure it out . I 'm sorry Simon . Sorry for what ? What are you talking about ? If you get on this ship , if you use a few more bars of oxygen to pressurize the airlock ... You know how it 's going to end . Better have four survivors than eight corpses . It 's a difficult decision , a decision nobody should have to make . But I can 't let you in . Eva , I 'm sorry . Yann , open the fucking door ! What are you doing ? - Open it . - Stop ! You know I can 't make those fucking solar panels work . - If they get in we 're all dead . - You can 't decide for all of us . You 're the one who talked about a radical solution . He 's waking up . Hello . - I 'm back . - Fuck ! Basile , the batteries ! You 're going to kill us all ! It 's not me , I didn 't do anything ! He did it . Everything 's working . And there 's still power . Basile , you 're a genius . See ? It wasn 't so hard . We 're good . Take off your helmets . Let me open this door . Wait . What did he say ? Who are you ? Shit ! Where is the Z1 mission crew ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . We found you alone and unconscious in the desert . Where is the rest of your crew ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . He seems fine . If I 'm here it means you must know who I am . Okay , I think we got off on the wrong foot . I am Simon Gramat , second in command on the Ulysse mission . I 'd like to know whose life I just saved . We have an idea but we 'd like confirmation . Better ? I am Vladimir Komarov . Colonel and pilot in the Soviet Union army . I was born on March 16 , 1927 in Moscow . I have the honor of being part of the space program , and have been chosen by the First Secretary to command the Soyuz mission . I don 't know how I got here . But I will not tell you anything else about my role in my country 's army . How old are you colonel ? Forty years old . Who is the president of the United States ? Lyndon Johnson . Regressive memory is common in PTSD . Maybe he 's telling us about family stories , or the last book he read . What do we do with him ? Usually it only lasts a few days . I think we should keep him in quarantine . For safety . I have a bad feeling about this . Keep examining him , and send everything back to Earth . Did you manage to sleep ? No . Alessandra , we didn 't talk about it but ... - I 'm sorry . - Please . He knew the risks . There will be a time to think about him , but not now . We got an answer from Earth . You should see it . Commander , I 'm sorry for the delay . Zillion has just confirmed that there was no Russian cosmonaut on their ship . As for the pictures you took of him , we have a problem . You will find a file attached . Open it . This picture comes from the archives of the Russian space program . This is Vladimir Komarov . He died in 1967 during the atmospheric reentry of Soyuz 1 . So , I assume there is a logical explanation . Komarov would be over 90 years old if he had survived . He doesn 't look 90 . Sync and translation by captainlucie ...

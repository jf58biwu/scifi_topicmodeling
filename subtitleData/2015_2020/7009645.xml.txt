 We date back to the Victorians . Percival Westmorland ? Have you thought about how insane you are ? Jumping in a chopper to a mad scientist 's private island ? Have you seen Marty Duko lately ? No way . There are cops outside of our house , Donnie . We have to get out of here . Rachel just wants power . She 'll cut us all down . You 'll bring back Cosima , Sarah . We know you will . Sarah , Rachel 's taken the cure . Delphine was alive when they took her away . You found your cure . You can shoot me up like old times . You won 't be allowed to stay with her . Mr Westmorland will see you now . That 's impossible . Not for him . No , don 't worry . The whole family 's just fine . - Sarah . - Felix . My phone is gonna die , just listen . Okay , yeah , I 'm listening . Ferdinand took Kira and Mrs S. - What ? - Go check the safe house . It 's all Rachel , she 's taken over from Susan . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . No , you 're not . You 're lying . I can hear it in your voice . Look , it doesn 't matter , okay ? Okay , Rachel took the cure before Cosima could get to it . - What 's happening ? - Just , Sarah , get your ass off the island . I 'm not leaving without Cosima . Put me on speaker . Ira , Susan said she sent Cosima to a boat . Where is that ? - Is Susan all right ? - Answer the question . On the west side of the island , there is a boathouse . It 's at a river mouth downstream from the village , but ... Downstream from what village ? Hello ? Ira . What village ? Come on , come on . Shit . Sorry , monkey . Please , please , please , please . Yes ! Yeah . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Mummy ? Mummy , wake up . Come on . There 's so much to do today . Wake up , Mummy . - Wake up ! - Kira . Hello ? Who 's there ? Look at me . - I finished our homework . - If you 'll please excuse us . I 'm breaking in . I 'm gonna keep you warm . You won 't be allowed to stay with her . I think I 'm dying . You must not doubt anyone . Hello ? Oh , good . What ? No , no , no , no . No . No ! You know that she is sick . Hello ? Good morning , Cosima . Who are you ? Oh , ah ... Right . Welcome to Revival . Sustaining life off the grid since 1908 . My name is Mud , and these are your Wellies . Do you know where Delphine went just now ? Er ... To work , I think , at the clinic . - She 'll be back . - I really need to talk to her . I know . It 's a lot , right ? You woke up in a yurt . You 're wondering who all these people are . You just wanna know what 's going on . Yeah , are you gonna tell me ? I 'll show you . This is Revival . Come on . We 're almost completely self-sufficient . We generate our own power , we have our own comms . Great . I ... I need to talk to my sisters . Oh , you 're not gonna be allowed to do that . And our greenhouse is over here . We raise all our own livestock . Er , there is a fish farm . We have everything we need . All these people are chosen from every part of the world . - Why are they here ? - To genetically improve the human race . We all contribute and we all benefit . I had some pretty beneficial science stolen from me . Do you know Rachel Duncan ? Oh , we do now . Yeah . This is a big day for all of us . - She 's in seclusion with him . - With who ? The founder . We 're all his children here . You lost me . Who ? Whose children ? P.T. Westmorland . He lives here , with us . Really ? How old is old P.T. now ? One-hundred and seventy , last June . Are you familiar with his 1880 paper on post-subjectivity and collective research living ? It 's totally visionary . Wow . Okay . - Cosima . - Hey , Charlotte . Oh , my God . Hey . Tweedle small and Tweedle tall . Just ignore her . - What were you doing in there ? - It 's sort of a school . Okay . That 's weird . Er ... How are you feeling ? I 'm feeling okay , but what happened to your treatment ? You let me worry about that , okay ? Delphine , my friend , she 's got our back . - What about Susan ? Is she okay ? - I heard she 'll pull through . - How did you hear that ? - Rumours . P.T. and Susan go way back , but family feuds , who 's to say ? Oh , God ! It 's me ! Oh , my God , Arthur ! I almost hit you with a pan ! Yeah , well , I almost shot you , so we 're even . Did you find anything ? Corkscrew through the back of the hand , pub-fighting . Classic Siobhan . That 's a good thing . Now Ferdinand 's pissed off . Er , I just need you to think . Where would he take them ? I need you to tell me that we 've got something to go on here . Hey , there 's always something to go on . I can 't contact Siobhan 's network . - I 'm worried they 're playing , too . - Look , I 'm gonna help you . But there 's a Vice on me down at the station right now over the Duko thing . I don 't even know who 's legit police and who 's Neo right now . - So , one favour . - Yeah . The Hendrixs , make sure they stay put . We can 't put anyone else in harm 's way . Yeah , I 'll pass it on . Kira and Siobhan are gonna be all right . Okay ? We 'll find them . Art and me , we 're hatching a plan , okay ? We 're gonna get them back soon , I promise . Felix , what do you need us to do ? Nothing . I don 't need anything . Just ... Where 's Helena ? She 's out hunting . Trapping . It 's all categorized as hunting , Donnie . I know . But specifically , she 's trapping . Okay , this is dire , Donnie . He needs some ideas of concrete plan on how to save Kira . No , no , no , I don 't , Donnie . I just you to stay put and stay safe , Art 's request . Just keep yourselves , and particularly , Helena the blonde under wraps for now . He 's right . Think of our babies . Great . I 'll talk to you guys soon . Okay ? Bye . Felix ? Oh ! Poop on a stoop , we don 't even know what the plan is . The plan is to sit tight . - Sit tight in a national park ? - Yes ! Right , with Sarah stranded and Kira missing , and no word from Cosima ? - Yes ? - Well , get packing , mister . Bell . I got a present for you . Yeah , what 's that ? Maddie ? You know Maddie Enger ? Hey , Art . We met before . Yeah . Vice , right ? - Big time . - Vice is not her current problem . Her current problem is she 's a misogynist . My partner was overly-versed in sensitivity training . Regardless , there 's a divorce in the family , so we 're shuffling the deck . You finally got a new partner , Art . My advice to you both , go at it slowly this time , huh ? Make it last . Just like that , huh ? Just like that . Hold still here . - No sign of her . - Where 's Amar ? - Come in , Amar . - I 'm just upstream , Cooper . - I 'm bringing the dogs from the village . - Hurry up . The old man was clear . We don 't go home until she 's back at Revival with the other one . Roger that . " Revival " ? You 're Afghan ? From Afghanistan ? Yes . Do you speak English , Aisha ? Do you know why you are here ? To get better . Yeah . Can you open your mouth for me ? Thank you . We came for the fountain . Good luck . Why is this door locked ? What ? Open up . I 'm coming . Open it ! New arrivals just left , they must have locked it on their way out . - What ? - It 's time . He wants to see you . Me ? Why ? Now . All satellite maps to the island are blurred , but Susan 's compound is down here , boathouse , here , and the village is up here somewhere . They call it " Revival " , but that 's all I know . Susan hasn 't been there in years . She avoided the subject altogether . You expect us to believe that ? Ira , Rachel has forsaken you , so for God 's sake , pick a bloody side . Bollocks . Now would be time for some good news , Scott . Sorry , Felix . It 's enough to start a rescue mission , but ... Scott , how ? Jet skis , frogmen ? I 'm on a bicycle , boys . Well , we 're reaching out to the mast one . What do you mean ? MK ? That 's good , actually . She 's skilled , but skittish . How exactly does one reach out ? Well , we know she games hard , right ? So I spammed hundreds of platforms with hundreds of avatars named Sarah Manning . We 'll see who gloms . I 've no idea what he just said , but MK once contacted Kira through a game . - It was this , uhm ... - Minecraft . Thank you . I saw her playing on her laptop at the safe house . - Do you think that would help ? - It could , yeah . Great . All right , I 'm on it . Just keep after him . Major crimes . Man . I tell ya , it 's good to be back home . Then why are we so far outside the city limits ? Do you have a case , Maddie , or a reason why we 're out here ? Yeah . I wanna make out . Oh , the file 's here somewhere . - You ever work Vice ? - No . The things I saw down there , sex stuff , extreme body-mod torture crap . That shit 'll rot your teeth out . But this is truly incestuous . Mmm . No cracks . Still . Damn , you 're a survivor . But the thing is , your preppy friends are only worth what they know . And I 'm betting they know where this one is . You ever meet the psycho ? Running around all pregnant . No . Never seen her . I 'm realizing , you don 't know how far we 're willing to go to bring all these clones in . You better embrace this new future , Art , 'cause it 's gonna be here real soon . Yes . Skills ! What the dickens are you doing ? I 'm loon-calling Helena . I 'm like Jeremiah Johnson over here . - She 's close , by the way . - Good . Well , I packed all of her things . Yeah , yeah . Is that the emergency loon call ? What do you do with furs that still smell like fur ? - Don 't move . - Oh ! Let go of me ! Donnie ! Donnie ! Donnie ! Donnie ! Let go ! Let go of me ! - It needn 't be so harsh . - Shit ! Hello . Which faction are you from ? My name is Mr Frontenac . There is only one faction now . Oh . Consolidation . The bane of diversity , if I may say . Particularly under dear Rachel . You needn 't fear the change upon you . Rachel has taken a special interest in your family . Yeah . I can see that . Shall you and I do this amicably ? Fudgy fudgers ! I can 't breathe . Alison , stay calm . Where are Donnie and Helena ? How should I know ? Helena was out murdering God 's creatures and my husband abandoned me . Where do you think they 'd go ? What is happening , Art ? They want you to come in , Alison . Your sisters , your family ... They want a truce . A truce ? Kidnapping children is a Neo-definition of a truce ? You need to understand the benevolence on offer here . Comes from above . I 'm sworn not to harm a single hair on a single clone head . Oh , oh ! - Now , where 's is Helena ? - Er ... - In the woods . - What 's her backup plan ? I don 't know her backup plan . - You do . - No ! No , I don 't . She ran . Where does she go when she runs ? I don 't know . Okay , I believe you . No harm . We good , Art ? We done ? We 're just getting started , partner . Let 's take you home and tuck you in . And maybe we 'll all live long , healthy lives . " We are all Revival 's children chosen for a brighter future , " where our frail bodies become so much stronger " and death and aging haunt us no longer . " - This place is scary . - Yeah . Do you know what a myth is ? It 's an old , old story , and some of it 's true and some of it is not . But it 's told to us to teach us something . - Delphine . - I 'm so sorry . - I thought you were dead . - I wasn 't allowed to contact you . - Why are you here now ? - Please listen , there is no time . - Transport is waiting . - Could you give us 10 minutes ? - What 's going on ? - Please . This isn 't what I want either . Where are you taking her ? She has a research trip . I 'm going to Sardinia . Sardinia ? We each have a role here , Cosima . I don 't understand , this place is insane . What , you were saved by a 170-year-old man ? The science is real . Cosima , you ... In here , you can 't make the obvious assumptions . It 's like nothing I 've seen before . You didn 't think it would be there ? I need something to hold on to . This entire island is a decades-long pro-longevity study . - And everyone here is participating ? - Yes . Stem-cell therapy , cryonics , caloric restriction , immunotherapy , cloning ... I mean , think about it . If you want to genetically improve the human race , life extension is the first principle . This place ... This is the heart of Neolution . There is a child , and she has cancer . I 've seen others like her brought here for some experimental treatment . What does this have to do with ... Rachel is ramping up their agenda . And this has something to do with it . It 's time . There 's a clinic across the camp with a red cross on the door . This is the key . Okay ? Come on , let 's go . I hid your treatment in the back of a fridge . It 's ready . I 'll find you and Charlotte . - Let 's go . - Okay ? Follow the crazy science . They 're scenting her this way . So what are you waiting for ? Who 's hanging game way out here ? Just track the girl down . That 's what he wants . Move it , Amar . Mummy . Mummy , wake up . Mummy ! Cooper , what the hell is going on out here ? Could it have been the girl ? Mmm-mmm . - Then what was it ? - Must have been a bear . Wasn 't a bear , something stabbed it . It was a bear . You got that ? It 's gonna be dark soon . Let 's cut and head back . What about the girl ? Good luck to her . Hello . Do you want to be left alone ? It 's a complicated question . I know . I 'm sorry about your friend . Yeah , well ... Never really had any , uhm , real control over it . Wow . Wow , it 's time . - What ? - It 's time ! What is going on ? P.T. has something to tell us . What ? Thank you . I am humbled to have pierced the veil and to address you on behalf of Mr Westmorland . Like you , I was selected . I know now his hand guided my entire life . I know , Susan Duncan , my mother , once stood here as I am . Appointed to move the future forward , and she did . She created me . It is time to be brave , to sacrifice . The fruits of nearly 200 years of Neolution science are now within our grasp . And we , here , shall drink from the fountain first . - Freeze . - Whoa ! On your knees , hands on your head . Okay , just calm down . Oh , Jesus ! Helena . Helena ! Ouch ! Oh , my God ! - Stick in baby . - Okay . Okay . Just ... Oh , my God . We 're gonna get you to the hospital , okay ? This is gonna hurt . Oh , God ! Oh , my God ! - Shh ... Shh ... It 's me . It 's me . - Sarah ? - Wait ... What ? - I came to get you . How did you get here ? Oh , my God ! You 're bleeding . - Hold on . - There 's a boathouse ... - Found a boat . - Sit . Sit down . What the hell happened ? Rachel went mad . Yeah , I know . Just , here . Let me take a look at you . Mmm . Er , what ? Uhm , I 'm sorry . I ... I didn 't fall asleep . What about your cure ? Er ... Well , Rachel didn 't get all of it . You 're meant to put that in your uterus ? I was kind of hoping you would , actually . No . No way . You and I are gonna go find Charlotte ... - and we 're gonna get you to somewhere safe . We 'll treat you there . Who gives a shit if the founder of Neolution is still alive ? I do . You 're crazy . - We need to go , Cosima . - No , I can 't . What are you talking about ? Look . Think about it , Sarah . Whatever this place is , it 's the answer . I don 't give a shit . I came all this way . Rachel tried to kill me . Cosima , you 're gonna come home with me . No . You need to go back . And take care of Siobhan and Kira , and I need to stay here for us . We 'll never be free if I leave now . - She 's not here . - What ? This is gonna be for me . You have to go . Oh , Christ ! I really don 't want to leave you here . This way 's clear . Come on ! There is something in the woods , Cosima . What ? - What do you mean ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . It attacked me , all right ? Just take care of yourself . - Find some answers . - Yeah , yeah . Oh ! What are you doing ? She 's here . Oh . Leave us , please . Not the easiest procedure to perform on oneself , is it ? I knew some of the sell line was missing . I keep very thorough logs . Stop , Cosima . You 'll hurt yourself . Give me the needle . Cosima ? I 'm as invested in this as you are . Thank you . Come . Lie down . You 're sure you know what you 're doing ? It has to be inserted into the uterine wall . Relax . Just breathe . There 's no need to be afraid any more . He wants you to be part of this . You and I are going to cure us all . Just hit me , Rachel . Hey ! Night , night . It 's a new day , Sarah . Kira ! We 'd like to study her here at ... We found MK . Rachel wants to restart human cloning . The easier you make this for us , the easier you make it on my new partner here . My babies are special like Kira . They want our biologist . I know you created me , so what the hell is the point of all of this ? We 're going to take such good care of you . You bitch !

Why is this happening to me ? [ Screaming ] [ Groaning ] _ _ how long you been following us ? Who is that man you were talking to ? We have to go , Tommy . _ how do we find our true purpose ? Is it something we 're born with , written into our genetic code ? Or is it something we must learn over time , a growing awareness derived from life 's joys and sorrows ? Mom ? [ Groans ] From our loves ... [ Groans loudly ] [ Dramatic music ] В ™ є в ™ є our losses , our achievements , and our suffering . [ Whimpers ] Mom , mom , it 's okay . I 'm here . [ Grunts ] I just wanted some more time with you . Mom , it 's fine , I 'm gonna get you to a hospital , okay ? [ Whimpers ] No . It 's too dangerous . Go . - No , no , no . - Go . [ Sirens approaching ] [ Fire truck horn blaring ] Mom ?

[ Gasps ] [ Indistinct chatter ] Hey there . What can I do for you ? Alexander French ? Yeah , that 's right . Whoo-hoo ! My god , that was a pretty shot . Did you see how his body crumpled before his eyes even realized he was dead ? Luke , I asked you a question . Yeah , honey , that was a really pretty shot . But this man , he had a family . This man was a monster . With a wife and a kid . Who are safer now that we acted . Or maybe we 're just making assumptions because his name was on some list . We don 't know anything about these people . He could 've been a teacher , a doctor , I mean- - [ clatter ] [ Approaching steps ] [ Dog whimpers ] [ Sighs ] Come on . Assalamu 'alaikum wabarakatuh . Assalamu 'alaikum wabarakatuh . [ Tense music ] В ™ є в ™ є [ high-pitched hum ] It 's time to head south , isn 't it ? Good . I 'm ready . Watch yourself , child . I know grown men who would shake in their boots if they knew the fate of the world was in their hands . Good thing I 'm not a grown man . [ Ethereal wind blowing ] [ honks horn ] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ fellow evernow champions , I 'm here with the daughter of the great hachiro otomo , the real-life katana girl ! _ _ we are on our way to America , but we can 't fulfill our quest without your help . So if you love evernow as much as I do , dress up as your favorite character and meet us tomorrow morning at the gates of renautas in midian . Gamers of the world unite . _ _ _ _ [ bicycle bell dings ] Look at these people . They 're digital sheep peddling their free bikes , eating their precious free Sushi , completely blind to everything that 's going on around them . You worked here for almost a year before you said anything . It 's really good Sushi . Come on , we got to find a way inside the research lab . Easier said than done . Who said anything about easy ? You saw what they did with that device . With epic online , no one is safe . If they 're really sucking out Molly 's power , they 're probably doing the same thing to Phoebe , turning her into some kind of- - like , a shadow blaster or something . What ? It 's a thing . It could be a thing . - Okay . All right , all right . - You don 't know . Look , just keep your head low , and do exactly as I say , all right ? If your sister 's here , we 'll find her . What you doing ? [ Wrench clattering ] Nothing . don 't look like nothing . What happened to your face ? Fell down some stairs . don 't change the subject . It was abuelito 's . don 't think it 's seen the road in about 20 years though . Dad promised we 'd fix it ... Together . It 's up to me now . You did all this ? All it needed was a little upgrade . Little upgrade ? It 's what he would have wanted . Come here , mijo . What is it ? Uncle Carlos ? I need to get to school . Uncle Carlos ? We 're gonna need bulletproof glass ... And kevlar , lots of kevlar . [ Humming ] Gotta try this spicy tuna . Do I know you ? No , Taylor , but you do know a friend of ours . What friend is that ? Molly Walker . You 're gonna help us break her out . Yeah , you are . What do you know about your mother 's research division ? What do you think you 're doing ? What kind of security does she have ? Noah Bennet . The original bag and tagger . Careful , Taylor . What kind of mother puts her own daughter into this line of work ? One who trusts me to get the job done . Or maybe one who doesn 't care if you take a bullet . You know , I almost met your mom once . June 13th . Right after the bombing . All I wanted was one minute so I could ask her face-to-face what happened to my sister . Security was too tight . I couldn 't get near her , but now , I can get all my answers . What do you think you 'll find out ? She 's kidnapping innocent people . You have no idea what she 's trying to accomplish . And you do ? What is it you think she 's trying to accomplish , Taylor ? Locking up human beings ? Torturing them ? - You don 't know that . - But they are human beings , Taylor . You must have seen that . Believe me , all parents will lie to their kids to protect them from the truth . I am not asking you to betray your mother . I 'm just asking you to question her . [ Eerie humming ] What happened to Francis ? You know , every time I doubt the path I 'm on , I think about you , Taylor . Mom , can we not drudge up the past for once ? Look , I 'm not mad at you for sleeping around . What upsets me is you would sleep with one of them . You act like this is just some fling . - With an evo . - With a great guy who I care about a lot . When did you become such a bigot ? You have no idea what I am or what I 'm trying to accomplish here . Then tell me , mom . Bring me in for once . Why are we rounding these people up ? Did you know that aluminum used to be one of the rarest , most valuable metals in the world ? I asked you a simple question . In the courts of Napoleon III , French royalty were served in round plates of solid gold while only the emperor himself had the honor of eating on a plate of aluminum . That 's how hard it was to come by , and of course a few decades later , a chemist by the name of Charles Martin hall developed a way to extract aluminum from common dirt at almost no cost , and just like that , it went from the banquet halls of royalty to the pantries of peasants , all because of one person 's creative spark . This isn 't a Ted talk , mom . Just tell me the truth . What are you really after ? Abundance , Taylor . A world of infinite supply so that you never have to suffer through war , hunger , pollution , terrorism , greed . I mean , all the horrible consequences of an overcrowded , selfish , doomed planet . But you still haven 't answered my question . Why are we rounding up evos ? To save our species . Do you trust me ? Dr. Susan Morris to icu . Dr. Susan Morris to icu . Tommy ! I 'm so glad you 're okay . Dude . Uh , what are you guys doing here ? A friend gets t-boned by a drunk driver , we 're not gonna sit at home with our thumbs up our- he gets the point , Brad . We were worried about you . Oh . Wow . Thomas Clark ? Is my mom okay ? She suffered what we call a blunt splenic trauma causing an internal hemorrhage . But now she 's fine , right ? She 's stable , but we 're still gonna have to do a blood transfusion . Okay , great . Let 's do it . - What 's wrong ? - We don 't have any o-negative blood on supply . It 's quite rare , and ever since the evos came out , blood donations aren 't what they used to be . What about mine ? You can give her mine , right ? Well , blood relatives are more likely to be a match , but- then test it . Tommy . She 's the only family I have . [ Chuckles ] I almost forgot what it feels like to sweat . Isn 't it weirdly refreshing ? The sindhis of Pakistan do not sweat . We glow so that god may see us better . Of course you do . Why are we stopping ? The signs were there just like she said they 'd be . We don 't have time to just stop . Time ? What do you know about time ? I 'm not a child anymore , farah . Have you ever wondered why we kept you hidden in the arctic ? They 've been hunting you , Malina . Ever since your first birthday , our enemies have been searching for you with only one thing in mind- - death , which is why we must fight them back with life . [ Speaking in urdu ] _ calm down . Calm down , sir . We pose you no threat . I need help out here now ! Yeah , there are these two- - - training is over . What 's the matter with you ? It 's gorgeous out . I 've been fighting this wicked headache the last couple days , so- - no , no , it just--it just- - it feels better in the dark . Take a bloody aspirin . No , I 'll be fine . Look , babe , I 've been doing a lot of thinking , and ... I think maybe I should sit out this next appointment . Maybe you should too . Maybe we both should . We could--I don 't know , we could rent a boat and watch the sunset , and maybe open a bottle of wine , be normal like we used to be . Normal ? It 's not too late . Oh . Feels like the surface of the sun . Yeah , like I said , my head- no wonder you 're not yourself . Here . Get some rest , drink plenty of fluids , and I will pick you up some meds on the way back . We used to be a part of something special , weren 't we ? Things always look better in the rear view . No , we were happy . I know we were . Things change , Luke . You gotta keep changing with them . Joanne . What ? I still love you . [ Eerie music ] [ Eerie humming ] [ Labored breathing ] It 's beautiful , isn 't it , when nature 's so unpredictable ? Do they have any idea what 's really coming ? I hope not , for their sake . But I 'm just one person . What if I can 't save them all by myself ? You 're not alone , Malina . You 'll have help , even if the others don 't know it yet . [ Indistinct pa announcements ] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ footsteps approaching ] What did you do to the suit ? Meet version 2.0 . You might want to stand back . [ Hydraulic gears working ] So you made yourself a fancy costume . Am I supposed to be impressed ? Yeah , a little . Become a man who 's fit to wear it , then I 'll be impressed . I 'm not doing this for you , father ... Or for Oscar . Then why don the mask ? 'Cause for once , I want to believe in something bigger than me . Captain dearing will be looking for you . I have a feeling he might be onto me as well . I will just have to get to him first . Mom , don 't get mad , but ... I had my blood tested to see if we were a match . I know what you 're thinking . How could I risk exposing who I am ? But I had no choice . [ Door opening ] The test results came back . And ? You weren 't a match . How could I not be ? It 's never a sure thing , even amongst family members . So what do we do ? Well , the closest blood bank with her type is in south bend , Indiana . I can put in an order , but it could take up to six hours . Tommy , is there something you want to tell me ? About what ? What happened in there ? She still needs blood . Tommy , where are you going ? Indiana . Want to come ? Sorry , cleared employees only . But you do know who I am ? Yes , Ms. kravid . Good , then you should 've seen this coming . [ Both groan ] Now let 's find Molly . [ Beeping ] [ Door opening ] We 're close . Molly 's in here somewhere . We don 't want to shoot you , but we will if necessary . " We " ? That 's the guy that took my sister , or at least one of them is . Hit the ground on the count of three . - Wait , what ? - One ... What if they know where she is ? - two ... - I hate your face , Bennet . Three . How are we not pausing to have a conversation about this ? You just saw that , right ? Right ? Three dudes just kind of crumbled into piles of kosher salt ? Welcome to my world . I 'm telling you , this list of evos has been a godsend . Remember the first one we killed ? Of course . Afterward , you were so content . You were so blissfully satisfied . I have ... Never seen anyone sleep so soundly . I spent the rest of that night hunched over a toilet . Why are you saying this now ? We lost our son , joanne , and for the last year , I 've been so terrified that I would lose you too , and the truth is I have lost you . I have lost myself . We have lost each other . What the hell ? [ Tires screeching ] If you want to do it , do it . [ Breathing unsteadily ] I really did love you . [ Car alert beeping ] [ Eerie humming ] [ Pa system chatter ] You ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary ? [ Laughs ] I work at an ice cream parlor in carbondale , Illinois . An extraordinary ice cream parlor . [ Laughs ] Look , the thing is , Emily , I-I do get that feeling , all the time , and it sucks . There 's , like , 1,000 pounds of pressure weighing me down , reminding me that I 'm different . Good . Good ? You are different , Tommy . You 'll always be different , but trust me , the moment you accept that , you 're gonna start having way more fun . Now ... Let 's go save your mom . Oh , my gosh . We totally just- - I am so never flying commercial again . We have the blood ! - You have to run ! - What ? Your blood test went straight to a federal database . They know what you are . I 'll take care of your mom , but you have to run . Now ! Let 's go . You know what you have to do . There are people watching . Tommy , don 't worry about them for once . Just be you . Be extraordinary . I wouldn 't do that if I were you , Mr. Clark , not if you want your mother to get that blood you were so kind to deliver . Uncle Carlos . I was thinking we could add some performance cylinder heads . [ Engine starts ] You did it ! It sounds great . Hey , can I come with you ? Ah , too dangerous . I want to push it up to 100 . Nothing 's gonna happen . I 'll be fine . I know , mijo , but ... I need you here holding down the fort . [ Tires screeching and engine revving ] [ Metal part ricochets ] You 're not going to believe this . My dad , El vengador . Just slow down . I used to be so afraid to show him what I could do , but this whole time , we could 've been a team . Jose ! _ well , look who we got here . two for one special . Run , Jose ! Go ! Find your uncle ! Come here ! I got the kid ! Holy- - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ people yelling ] There she is . It 's katana girl ! [ All screaming ] Phoebe ? Phoebe ? - Are these all- - - evos . They were smart enough not to go to Odessa on June 13th , but they still couldn 't hide from your mother . Oh , my god , Francis . What did she do to him ? Plotting bitch . I once knew a man ... Who could harvest people 's powers through their brains . He collected them , used them for his own ends , but I think your mother has found another way . Noah ? Noah . Molly . Molly . You 're gonna be okay . It 's all gonna be all right . There 's no stopping it . Every machine has an off switch . Not this one . I swear I didn 't know what she was doing . I 'm so sorry . What ? What is it ? You should 've never found me . Molly . I 'm just here to help . People have been telling me that my entire life , but all they want to do is use me for my powers . You should understand that better than anyone . I 'm not proud of my past . You know if I could change it- forget about the past , Noah . This is about so much more than you and me and June 13th . I was there in the hospital when your daughter died . What happened ? We all knew what was at stake , and we agreed to do whatever was necessary to keep them safe . - No--no ! - What are you doing ? Erica tried to take everything from me , but I was strong . [ Crying ] I was really strong , and I didn 't give her the location . Of what ? If I tell you , you won 't go back , and then we 're all dead anyway . You 're not making any sense . I can 't stop Erica , but I will not help her kill 7 billion people . What ? Molly , put the gun down , and let 's talk , okay ? You 're the only one who can tell me what really happened on June 13th . Forget the past , Noah . Save the future . Molly , just- - [ gunshot ] [ Sobbing ] [ Alarm blaring ] We can 't leave her like this . If we don 't , we 're gonna end up just like her . Come on , man . We got to go . Find them . They can 't be far . We just lost Molly Walker , gunshot wound , self-inflicted . How exactly did she manage to get her hands on a gun ? Security ID 'd Noah Bennet , and ... Well , there 's no way to put this delicately . He was with your daughter . Bring them to me . What about epic ? Local tracking still functions properly . As long as you 're within 100 feet of an evo , they 'll all register on the device . But remote locations ? Not without the girl . At least tell me we found it before she died . [ Scoffs ] Lovely . It 's only the future of the entire human race hanging in the balance . Before global tracking went down , epic did pick up a signal in Canada that showed some potential . It 's too late for potential , Mr. Harris . I need you to find me that child , and when you do , I need you to kill it . I 'll put my usual team on it . No . This is too important . This time , you 're taking the shadow . We all havea unique purpose , and try as we might , we cannot run from it . Will we be able to stay true to who we are , or will we succumb to the pressure of Destiny and become something else entirely ? Something inhuman ?

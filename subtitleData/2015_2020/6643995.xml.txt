 Previously on " Hunters " ... Agent Regan was taken . Agent Briggs , you wrote that Agent Regan appeared to be a willing passenger in Musa 's helicopter . Yes , ma 'am . I know you killed my parents . Is that what the humans told you ? Are they still alive ? The ETUs know more than I do . Hunters have been seeking access to lithium mines in Romania from as far back as 1989 . Raw materials for thermonuclear weapons . She 'll be ready for the Purge . Your mom and dad aren 't your real family . They were assigned to you . Like you to Flynn ? They said I 'd gone native , but I refused to come in . Even if it meant being someone I never really was , I wanted you more . They need to think that I put up a fight and that 's how you escaped . Shoot me . Do it ! Regan 's not the mole . Jules ran the diagnostic . Told her she made the calls to McCarthy . And he knew about talking on Columbia . Good luck finding somebody else to spy on citizens for you and order drone strikes for you and torture people for you . There 's just one more thing you need to do . What happened ? I got away . Flynn , are you awake ? Yeah . I 'm awake . We have to leave in 12 minutes . I know . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . Why are you breathing so hard ? I 'm fine . Let me get dressed . Hey . Will you put on some coffee ? Sure . Finnerman thinks you went with Musa willingly . She would think that . - Agent Regan ... - What ? No Alison anymore ? I 'm going to need to know everything that happened during your captivity , and I mean every last detail . I 'm not gonna tell you shit until you tell me the truth about what happened to my parents ... sir . Your parents ? What did you do with my mom and dad ? Oh , nothing . Who told you we had anything to do with them ? Musa . Well , he 's lying . You saw the Quins capture them . If Musa had my parents , he would have used them to try and turn me . Regan , I honestly don 't know what happened to your parents . Musa might be a monster , but at least he told me the truth . Okay , bring her in . That 's it , okay , a little more . This place is impressive . Looks like things are really getting organized . I heard things got gnarly at the old hospital in Circleton . We got most our gear out before the ETU raided us , but it was close . Jules didn 't exactly give us a lot of time . There was no leak from outside ? No , we were never breached . ETU must have caught a break . They 're nipping at our heels and now we 've got no one on the inside . He was eliminated , wasn 't he ? Yeah , Jules was taken in the Great Hunt . Good . He 'd served his purpose . We 're moving ahead with it , then ? Everything 's on schedule . The Purge will take place exactly as planned . If you 're reading this , it means I 'm no longer with you . You 're on your own now and you have to be strong . This is what we are . Ones we can 't trust , they 're here . Come on . No matter what you do , I am your father . And you 're my little girl . And I 'll always love you . Hey . Hey . I heard you saw Abby . Is she all right ? I 'm okay . Thanks for asking . Sorry . I 'm glad you 're back , really . Yeah , I saw Abby . Did you talk with her ? She tried to brainwash me . Called it deprogramming . Deprogramming from what . Human life . Abby told me they did the same thing to her , probably why they got her to try and turn me . Didn 't work . You came back . And Abby did not . I guess it worked on her . She let me escape . Why would she do that ? Don 't know . Maybe they didn 't want me . Are we responsible for Regan 's parents ' disappearance ? That 's just Musa manipulating her . Regan was on the inside . She had direct contact with Musa . She has vital intel , intel we have no other means of acquiring . Well , if she 's refusing to talk , we do have options . Put her in the chair ? Use her own treatment against ... The Hunters are mining raw materials for WMDs and you 're concerned about her discomfort . We will do whatever it takes . She will cooperate . Only if we give her what she demands . That 's not unreasonable . If you know anything about Regan 's parents , now would be the time to tell me . We 've shut down the breeding camp and the Columbian operation . All other loose ends need to be tied . There 's nothing else outstanding . Except Regan . The reprogramming was unsuccessful . Hers or yours ? You failed . She spent so long as a human . You failed . Where is she now ? Let me answer that question for you . She 's back with the ETU . Full of information about us , spilling everything . You 're in charge of her during the Hunt . Alison ran off before the kill . Alison ? Why would she do that ? I guess she got spooked . You lost a Seraphin to the ETU , now Regan . Despite this , Musa still seems to think you 're an asset . But I beg to differ . He 's dying . It 's the reversion process . The shell hasn 't taken . It isn 't working . Stuck between Hunter and human . Shh ... It 's the only way . Regan . Regan . Before I say anything , I need to know you 're gonna talk to me . Holding out is just gonna make things worse . Worse than you lying to me ? Are you gonna cooperate ? Guanos are after a human . Sterling Martinez . Lives in Baltimore . Don 't know why they want him . It has to do with something they called the Purge . Sounds ominous . Your turn . I don 't know anything about your mother ... But your father , we have him . You have him ? What does that mean ? Finnerman has him at a secure facility . For how long ? How long ? ! He hasn 't been at that site for long , but altogether , he 's been held for six years . I 'm sorry . I want to see my father . You deceived me , Ruth . Agent Regan is our best asset , or was . I don 't know if she 'll ever trust me again . You and I go back three decades . There is no one I trust more . Which is precisely why I didn 't tell you . To protect you . Protecting me does not help Agent Regan . She 's in a very vulnerable state . If Agent Regan is medically unfit for work , she will need to provide a report to that effect . She gave us what we wanted . Now it 's our turn . Once Flynn and Briggs have found this Martinez and we can establish that the intel is legitimate , then we can move on Regan 's request . No . I 'm not lying to Regan . I made a deal with her . She will see her father without waiting on what happens to Martinez . Matter of fact , I 'll take her myself . All right , we gotta move fast on this . Sterling Martinez , 37 . Martinez is a former scientist with Wexxler-Kline , a Belgian pharmaceutical . As far as we can tell , he retired early , aged 30 . Big time farmer . Probably cashed in after inventing a pill that makes modern life better . Oh , you 'd know . Martinez appears to live modestly . Jules ' replacement can scour his financials to find out what he 's been hiding . Stephanie Le Guin , meet Agent Briggs , Agent Carroll . The muscle . Oh , Miss Congeniality . Steph 's a cryptographer , Finnerman brought her in to continue working on decoding the Hunter language . The Hunters have their eyes on Martinez . This is coming from Regan . How do we know it 's not compromised ? We don 't . This is where he 's holed up , Fells Point . Musa is casting a line . Let 's reel Martinez in first . We 've tried everything to make the process work . Without the reversion , there is no Purge . Losing the Coahuila cell set us back . Ted alone cost us a decade of research and then McCarthy and his antics . Maybe it 's time you bring in the human . We rely on them too much as it is . But he 's made a breakthrough . And we have no other options . Abby 's right . Bring in Martinez . I can 't . I have to meet with Karp . He 'll only deal with me . I 'll go . No , definitely not . I 've already been in touch with him . I can handle it . As well as you handled Regan ? Abby can take care of it . Thank you , Musa . Do not disappoint me . I won 't . The Feelers will go with you . Go . All clear . Looks like Martinez didn 't retire after all . No , he took up fishing or he 's opening a Red Lobster . No , he 's studying this stuff . Carroll , take a look at this . Quins . He 's working for the Hunters . These are dated ten years ago . If they are baby Quins , then they 're all grown up now . That 's a comforting thought . Lots of stuff on a bone disease called craniodiaphyseal dysplasia . Says here it causes bone defects in the skull and face . Well , what do aliens care about a calcium disorder ? Mm-hmm . The hell are you doing ? Collecting evidence . Don 't pull that shit . How you gonna watch my back if you 're tweaked ? - I 'm not tweaked . - No , not yet , maybe . It 's for the pain . My legs have been screwed since the prison raid . Not your leg . Try your head . If you can 't handle this ... I can handle it just fine . Sterling Martinez ! Please don 't shoot me . Just take it one step at a time . I 'll be close by if you need me . Dad ? Alison . Look at you all grown up . Your hands , scars . Who did this to you ? It 's okay , it 's okay , I 'm not in pain . At least it stopped me from molting . I don 't miss that . Where 's Mom ? Is she here , too ? No . I don 't know where she is . I haven 't see her in years . I can 't believe it 's you . It 's me . I didn 't think you were still alive . How 'd they catch you ? I 'm not a prisoner . I work for them . Look at what they 're capable of . I didn 't know this place existed . Hunters were killing people . That 's what I wanted to stop . There 's a lot you don 't know . Who are these kids ? What 's wrong with them ? They were born with a rare sclerotic bone disorder , severe calcium buildup in the skull . So they 're human . I don 't understand . He doesn 't know . You have a homemade lab . You 're conducting experiments . Well , maybe you 're cooking drugs . Or bombs or worse . No , no , it 's just ... it 's just research . I work for a pharmaceutical company . We did a critical trial of a new drug . There were some side effects . They didn 't show up until some patients had children . You caused birth defects . Yeah , we did . Hundreds of kids . I took full responsibility . I mean , that 's why I retired early , to try and help them . I wanted to fix this . That 's what my research is about . I just made what I think might be a huge breakthrough . I 'm meeting with some new investors this afternoon . My last memory of you and Mom is both of you being taken by the Quins . Quins ? Never heard that before . The deformed Hunters . The ones who attacked our house . We call them Feelers . They 're Brother 's servants , like his bloodhounds . Very dangerous . How did you end up in here if Musa took you ? You know Musa ? Brother number four . We 've met . I know he 's the leader of the Hunters . Musa and I ... we had a falling out . Musa was becoming extreme in his measures and I disagreed . My life was in danger , so I left . The humans caught me . Here I am . Finnerman did this to you ? So many over the years . Not just me , other Hunters , too . They 're watching all of us . I can 't really blame them for the experiments . Humans are very curious , and also easily frightened . Quite nasty if you don 't answer their questions . Um ... Was this man ever involved ? I 've never seen him before . A soldier brought me here . Polynesian looking , had an accent . This guy ? The one on the left ? He looks familiar , but I can 't be sure . Someone reached out to me after I posted my results online , but I never met them . Oh , you didn 't think that was weird ? Random e-mail from a pharma exec ? Well , I vetted the credentials as best as I could . They 're with a startup , they seem well financed . - And what do they want from you ? - Well , my research . They have an interest in skull and bone disorders . They 're on their way here now . We need to roll , come on . - Excuse me ? - You 're in danger , we 're getting you out of here . Gather your research . All of it . There must be a mistake , I 'm just a retired ... Get your shit , now . Flynn Carroll . Flynn ? It 's me , Abby . Hang on . I 'm in trouble . I don 't know what to do . Just ... just slow down . Start from the beginning . Musa wants me to do something , but I don 't think I can do it . What does he want you to do ? Kill an innocent person , and if I don 't do it , Musa will kill me . What do you want from me ? I need you to come get me , but it has to be now . Abby doesn 't want to turn herself in . This is her play . She 's trying to lure you away so she can snatch Martinez . She sounded scared . And Regan told me Abby let her escape . And you believe that B.S. ? Man , we gotta strap you to the mast . She was my wife . This is my call . No . If Abby wants to come in , she will . With or without you . And if she doesn 't , you 're not gonna have the guts to do a thing about it . Musa 's planning something . I 'm worried a lot of innocent people are gonna die . There 's innocents here , too . I 've been locked away a long time . Please ... How many people are held here ? People ? None . How many captives ? Just the one . It would still be useful . I don 't know what to tell you . Tell me about the Purge . Nothing you should concern yourself with . Why are you still defending Musa ? He tried to kill you . Your mother tried to kill me . She 's Musa 's right hand . She chose him over us . The night the ... Quins came , your mother set us up to be captured . Why would she do that ? 'Cause Musa wanted me to come in and I wouldn 't . I was planning to leave the Hunters for good , give you a new life , free from all the ... Detour in the south hall . Why didn 't Mom want to come with us ? To keep our family together ? Your mother and I were playing roles . But I wasn 't . I wasn 't , not when it came to you . I 'm your father , Alison . And nothing , not even Musa , could ever change that . You okay ? You okay ? Yeah . Yeah . Something 's going on . We need to create a diversion . Dad ? Dad ? Help us , someone , please ! Help ! What 's going on ? I don 't know . Someone please ! Help her ! Help him ! Please ! Dad ? Dad ? McCarthy ? Aren 't you a sight for sore eyes ? Has a doctor seen you ? No , no , no , no , no , no ... No doctors . Just butchers . And of course , the butcher queen herself . Finnerman ? She never told you . Of course not . The stench of her indecency . Spare yourself , McCarthy , talk to us . I tried talking . Baseball , politics . Hell , we even played trivia . What do Nancy Sinatra , Freddie Mercury , and Brittany Spears all have in common ? I don 't know . You people turn their music into a misery . Use it to torture prisoners . At least Iron Maiden made sense . You 're a murderer , McCarthy . Then kill me . An eye for an eye . That 's one of your commandments , isn 't it , Elder Jackson ? My faith has nothing to do with this . Your faith has everything to do with this . Please . We know about the Purge . Cooperate with us and I will make sure you are treated humanely . Then Musa kills me for being a traitor . I will protect you from Musa and everyone else , I give you my word . Water , please . Christ on the cross asked for water . The least you could do is give me a sponge soaked in vinegar . God forgive us . Too good for your own good . Hi , Flynn . Surprise . The famous Abby . You know , you 're cute for a Guano . It 's all over . And they say metal is dead . You , head off McCarthy , I 'll get the doors ! No ! You stay ! Let me out ! Jackson ! Regan ! Shit . No . No . Come on . Stay with me . Stay with me . I want to see Flynn . You don 't think you 've messed with him enough ? Are you gonna kill me ? That 'd be no fun . Interrogation , on the other hand ... Hey , pack it up . Let 's go . You said clear it out . I don 't want to leave behind any research . What 's wrong ? Something 's not right . Why the hell didn 't you stop her ? I can 't do my job properly if you keep things from me . You let our most prized asset get away . If it wouldn 't raise questions about my facility , you 'd be out of a job right now . What the hell were you thinking ? He was bleeding . He was coughing up blood . There were wounds all over him . It was immoral , it was dirty , and I don 't want to take any more part in it . McCarthy is a liar and a serial killer . He murdered his own offspring . And what about Regan 's father ? He clearly loves his child , like a human . And he wasn 't spared torture . Which is precisely why I kept you out of it . I know your limitations , Truss , believe me . Better than you do . Now , you 're not gonna go and do anything foolish like resign , are you ? No . We have a job to do . Well , as long as you remain , I require your subordination and your discretion on this matter . You have it . As always . Good . Oh , and don 't worry . I 've made sure that the deaths of those young soldiers today aren 't on you . Not on paper , at least . Maybe if you weren 't so doped up , we 'd still have Martinez . And your sexy wife . I should have handled Abby , not you . Like you did at the hotel ? I would have brought her in this time . Oh , bullshit . You just had your shot . You let her go . You still think she loves you . Oh , whatever 's in that medication , that 's some strong hooch . You don 't know shit about me . You don 't know shit about you . You know that scar on your arm ? Jules had the same scar . So did other Hunter victims . Jackson didn 't tell you ? No . Man up and face your demons , if you even can . Guano should have killed you when they had the chance . I 'm back , Musa . The humans held me captive , but I escaped . I 've warned you to stop with the injections , the drug abusers . I did . Your recklessness caused the deaths of two Hunters , including your own child . Yet another transgression , attempting to breed in human form . What do you care ? We 're all expendable to you . You 're excluded from the Purge . You can 't do that ! You 've become a demon ! Injecting human flesh has made you sick in the mind ! Weak in the heart ! I can separate you from your misery right now . Or you do as I say , do you understand ? Know your place . Forgive me , Musa . You 're my brother . I am your servant . Your will is mine .

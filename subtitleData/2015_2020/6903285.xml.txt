 Previously on the expanse ... Shit . " Protomolecule . They gave the goddamn thing a name . Holden : What are we going to do with it ? and we fire it into the sun . That is too important to destroy right now . - Naomi : We 'll hide it . - Holden : Where ? Naomi : Out here . It 'll be safe . you need me . You need my government 's resources and my protection . I need a patron who understands the historic importance of what 's happening . The deep radar station on deimos . minimal personnel . Souther : You want us to attack a martian moon ? That 's a declaration of war . Bobbie : We trained all our lives for this . the better . I 'm sorry to disappoint you . We 're not going to earth . We 've been ordered to ganymede station . Farm patrol ? We 're marines ! And we serve where we are ordered to serve . Chrisjen : What 's happening ? Eros has changed trajectory again . It 's now on a direct collision course with earth . Sadavir : There 's only one option left . A massive missile launch at Eros . Un advisor : Our missiles have lost their target-locks . Fred Johnson is honorable . and my crew and I will guide them in . Drummer : One hundred and fifty live thermonuclear missiles under your control . I believe that makes you the most powerful man in the system right now . I know you can steer this ship . What happens to us now ? it happens to both of us . and it was filled with the best scientists and technologists humanity had to offer . We were ready to govern ourselves was still the property of old mother earth . I was a fusion-drive engineer . but I convinced her that we should buy a second-hand yacht for me to tinker around with instead . She liked to indulge me . I 'd been modifying the engine to boost fuel efficiency . and I was taking it out for a test run . Commence Pre-flight check . Commence Pre-flight check ! The voice interface had been problematic from the start . so I turned the damn thing off . is history . Okay . Let 's see what you can do . My name 's Solomon Epstein . And I changed everything . is that Eros was a test of a new martian zero-inertia drive . They 've been pumping RD into that project for over a decade . It 's the single most plausible explanation . possible that it was something else . Like a massive relativistic field generator or ... Or some other bunch of science words you string together ? Janus : The one thing we do understand is that Eros was a wake-up call . it 's clearly the greatest technological leap since the Epstein drive . it 's a weapon that will conclusively tilt the balance of power in favor of Mars . Dr. iturbi . You 're late . I can 't have missed very much . The Rocinante was closest to Eros than anyone . They might have more insight ... The Rocinante and James Holden have gone silent . and the martian government . So we will just have to be insightful on our own . Sadavir : Where are we on the impact site mission ? Janus : We 've commandeered a civilian survey vessel and are refitting it with our best sensors and probes . We 're also reinforcing the hull to allow us to get closer to the surface . we 'll find it . We 'll be on our way to Venus in a week . I 'll expect regular updates from you personally . sir . we need to clean up . One hundred and fifty missiles we launched . we 've confirmed abort on 121 missiles . but we 're confident we 'll be able to account for all the rest in short order . or if you 're even going to get this . so there 's some things I can 't talk about . But I just wanted to let you know that I 'm okay . I didn 't run from the fight . they helped avert a catastrophe . Helped save earth . I hope you get to meet them someday . One in particular . mom . and mom and dad and dad . It 's understood . watching Eros coming at you with no way to stop it ? I 'm amazed earth and Mars didn 't blow each other up - out of sheer panic . - Hmm . There 's still time for that . The Protomolecule turned an asteroid into a space ship . Nobody knows how or why . We 'll figure out how it works . Sooner or later . or some genetic toolkit . It 's alien . You still want to destroy our sample ? Yeah . Now more than ever . you know . Miller told me he trusted us to do the right thing . And we did . Hmm . I wonder if he knew that his trip to Eros would be one-way . I think part of him never left that terrible little room where we found Julie . I don 't think Miller wanted to be saved . Hmm . and Alex to your deaths . None of you even questioned it . It was the right thing to do . We all felt the same . I don 't want to be the one who says who lives and who dies . you are the captain of this ship . Holden : So in the interests that Naomi and I are together . Sleeping together . When did it start ? Just after we got out of Eros . I knew it . God damnit ! Son of a bitch ! It doesn 't make no sense ! I told you . Eros . Didn 't I say ? man . Give me that arm . Alex : I can 't believe I agreed to this . take your shot . What the hell was that ? brother . - Alex : You said it was a punch . - Amos : I know . answered . Hey ... I 'm glad that me and Naomi being together isn 't an issue for you . no . She 's a good person and I like her . But she 's like a sister to me . Right . I 'd do her if she 'd let me . I 'm glad we had this talk . It was supposed to be a punch . you got a second ? - Yeah . I gotta show you something . This is all the telemetry on the nukes the un launched against Eros . They detonated them after they lost target lock . That makes sense . That 's what the abort codes are for . except ... long after all the others aborted . Where are they now ? That 's the million-dollar question . I got no clue . Roci lost track of 'em when we were chasing Eros . - Oh ... - Right ? 30 of them didn 't get that self-destruct message . They just kept on going . Who knows where . don 't you think ? it is . My drive was working better . Way better than I ever expected . Fuel efficiency was through the roof . A hundred times better than anyone had even thought possible . A once-in-a-generation breakthrough . And that was the whole problem . a high-g burn hurts like hell . I felt like someone was standing on my chest . It was getting harder for me to breathe or talk . Shut down main drive . Not that talking would have made any difference . it was getting hard to even move . but it wasn 't the worst part . Because the most dangerous thing about being in a high-g burn it 'll kill you . how is Arjun ? He 's fine . on Luna . For quite some time . - This is not a date . - It 's not ? Those days are gone . Don 't be cross with me for trying . I asked you to that meeting to hear your opinion . You barely said a word . my opinion would have only made me less popular than I already am . You have a different theory about Eros ? yeah . More like radical . This is not a time to keep these things to yourself . but his problem is that he lacks imagination . It 's true . He can only conceive the world in terms of things he 's already seen . His job is to explain science to politicians . it 's a useful skill . But it 's of no use here . which we did not ... Did we ? We did not . I never doubted that for a moment . moves ... In a way that practically defies every single known law of physics . some staggering breakthrough on an incredible scale of a technology they 've been pursuing utterly unsuccessfully for years . But ask yourself this question ... Does it make any sense at all that Mars would want to test their ground-breaking technology that they themselves created ? I suppose not . So what if this bio-weapon isn 't a bio-weapon after all ? What if it is responsible in some way for Eros moving ? I believe Eros was infected somewhere beyond the reach of our species . I believe the Eros incident was our first contact with alien life . if they develop an unexpected new technology . My file for what to do if an advanced alien species comes calling ? find god . I need to get to Venus . You can pull the strings and get me on that ship . unfiltered by janus and Errinwright . let me prove I 'm right . Men : The heroes of Eros ! Jesus ! nice . How you doin ' ? good to see you . Thank you . Thank you so much . Great . We 'll catch up with you later ! easy . There 's plenty of me to go around . Diogo . You must continue to fight for the belt ! You must live . Just live ! " Whoo ! Fred : You 'd think helping to save earth but the mormons don 't think like that . They 've filed a lawsuit over the Nauvoo against the tycho corporation and myself . I 'm in some deep shit . we have one more thing for you to worry about . These aren 't rock-hopper mining nukes . These are planet busters . Designed to evade the best defense systems . it could be a problem . Especially if they 're smart enough to remove the counter-measures . for that matter . This doesn 't seem to be bothering you . Why is that ? Because I 've got the missiles . our techs were able to lock out some of the abort codes and override the drives . inside gas freighters and ore ships . We could use some help removing the counter-measures . Holden : What are you planning on doing with them ? Nothing . Sometimes that 's the best plan of action . The only thing those weapons are good for is first strike . they 're good for a lot of things . or a bargaining chip . Earth and Mars are still in the dark about the Protomolecule . We need to tell them everything we know about it . We need to tell everyone . And exactly what should we tell them ? That it 's alien technology that we barely comprehend ? That would cause a system-wide panic . we need to keep this under wraps . Eros changed everything . Earth and Mars are scared . Belters always lose . Our first priority is to protect ourselves . we 're gonna take advantage of every edge we 've got . I do this for you . about to shake herself apart ... I would have caught up with yesterday . Then all the blood leaves your brain and everything goes dim and ... bam ! A pump of that juice hits you just on pure instinct . No time to think . you 're dead . You need better things for think about . yeah ? Like what ? partner ! ya hear ? Amos : What the hell ? Amos ? Jesus Christ ! Amos ! What the hell ? You okay ? What the hell are you doing here ? You live here or something ? I got a flop next door . Next door 's a brothel . Yeah . Hey . no . You two enjoy yourselves . It 's okay . darlin ' . It 's all right . What do you want ? I want to know where you and I stand . I would 've thought that was pretty clear by now . It isn 't . I 've been straight with you since the first time I approached you after the Donnager . I have done exactly what I said I was gonna do . But now I 'm getting the feeling that you 're not being straight with me . I understand paranoia is a natural state of mind for a soldier . the first time ... you cut thrust for nearly five hours . What for ? You 've been poking through our nav logs ? Yeah . You got me curious . Amos was forced to kill a friend of Miller 's . They needed some time to work through that . And then Miller wanted to give his friend a proper burial at sea . Which means that it 's none of your goddamn business . you know . We 're on the same team . That 's the thing with all of you . the Opa . It 's all bullshit . There shouldn 't be any teams . son . And I hope I 'm around to see it come true . you have to pick a side . my fuel was going to last for weeks . Which I have to say was amazing . Aside from the fact that I 'd be dead long before then . The only thing I could do was to try to signal for help . caty would realize that I was in trouble . She 'd figure out a way to help me . It was my only hope . My last chance . And I blew it . Got a minute ? What 's on your mind ? I think we should let people know just about them . that sacrificed themselves to save the cradle of humanity . The Inners need to hear that . You 're going to turn them into a story . A love story . Might help cool things down a bit . apparently wasn 't enough . I want people to know about Miller . He was a good man . who got the job done . I 'll do it . Gotta go . Thank you . and now he 's going to squeeze every ounce of information out of Cortazar 's head to figure out how it works . He wants to control it . Fred 's trying to protect the belt . Or so he claims . It 's too dangerous to leave our sample out there anymore . We have to destroy it . Alex : Here 's another option . We can give our sample to Mars . What ? Think about it . They 're the only players in this whole goddamn game that didn 't do any of the bad stuff . They nuked Phoebe . and they just wanted to keep earth out of it . Or keep what they found there a secret . You don 't know what the hell you 're talking about as usual . Mars has the best scientists in the system . If anyone can think of something good to do it 's them . Since when has Mars done anything that wasn 't in the interests of Mars ? for starters . If any side believes they have a strategic advantage then eventually someone will . And then we 're going to have another Eros or worse . The only way to prevent that is to destroy it . All of it . While we still can . Dresden wasn 't working alone . Do you seriously believe we 've got the only remaining sample in the system ? We just might . it stopped the project dead in its tracks . Protomolecule samples aren 't easy to come by . We vaporized the Anubis . the original source was destroyed . nothing was there . And Eros burned up in Venus . once and for all . We should kill it . Drive it into the goddamn sun . It 's the only way . Yep . Yeah . Everything ready ? I 'm right about this . Holden : It 's done . Yeah ... it 's done . it happens to us all . everyone we love . Maybe you see it coming . Maybe it surprises you . what usually kills you is a stroke . all I could think about was ... " What happens next ? " I 'd never give caty a child . But she had the plans for my drive . They 'd make her rich for the rest of her life . Mars would be able to move outward . Mine the asteroids . Colonize the belt . And remake the solar system . My drive would give us the edge we needed to finally break free from earth . And build a new world for ourselves . That 's the wonderful and terrible thing about technology . It changes everything . Those un grunts are definitely loaded for bear . You really believe earth is going to try to take this station ? Why else would we be here ? apparently . stickman . You got it . sir ? marine . At least you 're finally off the bus . I really hope Eros was our tech . Be nice to have something in our back pocket to turn earth to slag if need be . Hillman . Sutton : Stow the speculation . Everyone 's jumpy enough as it is . sir ? Only if they shoot first . you 're getting a little close to the un line . maintain two clicks minimum separation . overwatch . Stickman-one out . Sa ' ID : Yeah . Backing off . Don 't want to make the blues nervous . Boom . You in the mood to talk ? What about ? About the friends we choose to keep . Like Jules-Pierre mao . Chrisjen . Maybe he was once . But it 's quite clear now that he was involved with Eros . We have no proof that that 's the case . His own daughter was working with the Opa to stop him . So you really believe that he was trying to destroy the earth ? Is that right ? He was playing with powers he couldn 't control . Have you had any contact with him ? I have no idea where he is . We need to know what he knows . You should convince him to come in from the cold . How am I supposed to do that ? He trusts you . he can keep a semblance of the life he 's always known . You 're really willing to cut him a deal ? Yes . And for anyone who could help us understand what we 're dealing with . We both know how the world works . many things are possible . I can reach out to his family . and another daughter that he adores . They 'll be able to reach him . Maybe they can help him turn himself in . Good . And please let them know that if they can 't ... I will rain hellfire down on them all . I will freeze their assets . Cancel their contracts . Cripple their business . because I am the fucking hero who helped save mother earth from the cataclysm that Jules-Pierre mao unleashed . Tell his children that government is more powerful than any corporation . And the only reason they think it tilts the other way public servants private-sectors payoff down the road . But I 'm not looking . it 'll be too late . Their family will be ruined . pariahs . Outlaws . Hunted and on the run for the rest of their days and nail each and every last one to the wall . Make sure you tell them that . Alex . What the hell are you doing ? Fixing the martian flag . Picasso . I 'm making it accurate . Deimos ain 't a moon anymore . It 's just a bunch of rock . That is not funny . I disagree . It makes me smile every time I walk past it . That 's because you are an ignorant asshole . Seventeen martians died in that attack ! Do you want to do something about it ? Go ahead . Take a shot . Hold on a second . Is this your messed up way of telling me you 're sorry ? Was it messed up ? do you ? 'cause I took care of that guy who was kicking your ass and I made you look weak . Is that what you think ? there 's only three kinds and ones you need to protect . so I 'm the one you need to protect ? Is that right ? there 's nothing to be ashamed of . I let a breaching pod with 25 people get blown to pieces Amos . I can fight my own battles . Naomi : I 'd suggest discharging the gyros first . A lot of missiles ' counter-measures trickle back-up power from the guidance systems . Okay . Thanks . I wasn 't expecting your help . Belters have to help each other . No one else will . this is overwatch . We 're heading into ganymede 's shadow . We 'll be in visual blackout for the next 48 minutes . Continue patrol and do not linger on the border . This is stickman-one . Understood . Hillman : What do we have here ? It 's not one of ours . And it 's definitely unarmed . Probably just an unlicensed ag drone - from one of the greenhouses . - Bobbie : Copy that . we are registering movement on the un line . closing fast . They appear to be charging us . Bobbie : They 're jamming us ! are you there ? do you copy ? are you under attack ? stickman . Their Comms are being jammed from the surface . We need to boost our signal ! we 're still in blackout . One minute out ! I need a surface visual now ! They are engaging in orbit ! - Who fired ? - Not our problem ! Spread out . Make a line . Free fire at 500 meters . 500 meters ? We don 't have permission to engage . you will fire ! marine ? gunny ! - Go ! I can 't believe we 're doing this .

 OCTAVIA : Previously , on The 100 ... - HARPER : It 's started . - CLARKE : They 're bleeding my friends . I think I know how to take Mount Weather . We just need someone on the inside . - Bellamy ? - They 're already using their blood , and things are gonna get ugly in here real fast . You 're not taking anyone else out of this room without a fight . - ( DOOR BUZZES ) - No . Hey ! ( GRUNTING ) Everybody go ! Take the level ! Go ! There 's a war council meeting happening tonight . All the leaders are going to be there . We 're gonna use a missile . Whitman to Mount Weather Command . All targets accounted for . We have to start evacuating . If we evacuate , they 'll know we have a spy inside their walls . We slip away right now . On your command , sir . Fire . We have to leave now . You knew . Mom . Please tell me this wasn 't you . I wish I could . ( CHILDREN WAILING ) LEXA : ( MUFFLED ) No . Wake up . Wake up . Clarke ! ( WAILING CONTINUES ) I could have warned them . I could have saved them . If they see us , they 'll strike again . Victory stands on the back of sacrifice . You know that . I want the Mountain Men dead , all of them . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) I need bandages ! CLARKE : Right here . ( COUGHING ) It 's no use . She 's still alive . We save those who can be saved . I 'm so sorry . Lincoln , be careful . It 's not stable . They 're down there . ( GRUNTS ) Do you hear someone ? Abby , I 'm sure Clarke is okay . We 'll find her . Indra ! She 's alive ! Oh , Indra . ( GRUNTS LOUDLY ) ( INDRA SPEAKING TRIGEDASLENG ) - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GROANS ) - ( GUNSHOTS CONTINUE ) - MAN : Sniper ! Octavia ! The spotter . He aimed the missile . He 's alone . Clarke , just slow down . If he is a spotter , he 's here to make sure we 're dead . If he tells the Mountain were alive ... - He won 't . - How can you be sure ? Because I 'm gonna kill him . ( GUNSHOTS CONTINUE ) ( SHOUTING ) Get down ! ( GUNFIRE CONTINUES ) ( PANTING ) Lincoln , you must stop the bleeding . ( GRUNTING ) - Indra , let me help you . - No . What do we do ? No ! We 're trapped . I say we use the Sky Girl to draw fire . - You got a problem ? - Yes . You are the bringers of death . ( GRUNTS ) MAN : ( MUFFLED ) Help ! Someone 's alive down there ! MAN : Please , help ! ( WOMAN GROANING ) ( PANTS ) ( METAL CLANGING ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYS ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Jasper , where do you want this ? Put it here , no weak spots . We need to make sure they don 't get in . They won 't . We took the level , but now we have to hold it . They will be coming , and we need to be ready . Harper , get some pots from the kitchen , fill them with water , as big as you can find . Okay ? Watch out . Good , Fox . Let 's go get those hallway cameras , all right ? Nope . Leave the hallway cameras . We 'll need eyes out there . You can do that ? Have you met me ? - Where are we on the doors ? - Elevators are all disabled . I shorted the other stairwell locks . This one is tricky , though . I can 't seem to ... ( ELECTRICAL FIZZLING ) That works , too . How long do you think we can hold them off ? As long as we have to . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) ( SNIPER SHOTS CONTINUE ) I 've got to get down there . Now . ( GRUNTING ) - ( GROANS ) - ( PANTING ) LINCOLN : Octavia , come on ! What are we gonna do ? We can 't move . I 'm going for the shooter . I 'll sound the horn when it 's done . All right , my friend . I 'm going with you . No . Nyko needs you here . Are you sure you 're up to this ? - What can I do ? - Pressure here . ( GROANING ) This is my village . You 're the Chief Second . Save our people . We 're pinned down , and the other Seconds won 't follow me . So make them . Indra ? - ( PANTING ) - ( SNIPER SHOTS CONTINUE ) NYKO : She 's losing too much blood . Indra . We have to do something . Thanks , Sky Girl , but there 's nothing to do until the sniper is dead . - ( EXPLOSION ) - ( GASPING ) We are not ready for this . Yes , we are . Just follow the plan , we 'll be okay . - I promise . - Okay . No guns . You were right . It 's because they can 't kill us , not like this , anyway . Be careful with that thing . We 're in close . - You could hit one of us . - MONTY : Wait a second . Some of them aren 't wearing Hazmat suits . What 's it mean ? Means they 're cured . - The marrow treatments worked . - ( MUFFLED SHOUTING ) Get this down . Get ready . - Get it open ! - Go ! We got it . Go ! Take it down . MAN : Go , go , go . Now ! ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) ( JASPER SCREAMS ) Retreat ! Retreat ! Pull back . Pull back now ! ( JASPER SCREAMS ) We did it ! Seal the barricade ! FOX : No ! Jasper ! You promised ! Fox ! Fox ! No ! No ! She 'll be okay . I promised her . ( SOLDIER RASPING ) - ( SCREAMING ) - ( SOLDIER GROANS ) ( MAN GROANS ) Hold on . I 'm coming . Marcus . Marcus , it 's okay . I 'm here . It 's okay . Abby . It 's my leg . ( ABBY PANTS ) You 're bleeding , but not bad . Can you move your toes ? Yeah . Good . I don 't think anything is broken . You 're lucky . I 'm gonna get you out of here . ( GRUNTS ) ( SHOUTS ) Not that lucky . ( WOMAN GROANS ) That could be Clarke . I 'm not leaving you here . ( GROANS ) No ! Uh ! Uh ! ( SOBBING ) - SOLDIER : Drop her at the table . - No . No . Thanks . - Bellamy ! - You okay ? - ( SOBBING ) - it 's all right . I got you . Come on . We have to get her someplace safe . - Dad , you 're home . - Yeah . The drill bit broke again . - What are they doing here ? - Look . They 're in trouble . We just need someplace safe to stay . They need to go now . Let me explain . How about you explain where he got that uniform ? Maya , you know how dangerous this is . What are you doing ? What Mom would 've done . - I need you to leave . - Sorry . We can 't do that . That 's okay . He 's gonna help us . Really ? Because I 'm not getting that . My parents were part of a movement that was against using outsider blood . My mom refused the treatments , and it killed her . She was willing to die for what she believed in . Maya , you were five . I couldn 't leave you alone . I 'm not a little girl anymore . They were willing to kill you before . - If you get caught ... - We won 't if you help us . Please . They 're killing us . We don 't have anywhere else to go . Just this once , just for one night . Your room is this way . Thank you . You know they 'll never stop , right ? If the rumors are true and your bone marrow can get us back to the ground , they 'll never stop . It 'll be light soon . We won 't have the darkness to hide us . - Neither will he . - ( SNIPER FIRE CONTINUES ) I feel your anger , Clarke . Do me a favor , no more lessons . You need to focus . We do what we must to survive . The enemy does the same . - It 's not personal . - Lt is to me . You think that killing the shooter will make you feel better , but it won 't . The only thing that will do that is winning this war . That 's enough . - ( LEAVES RUSTLING ) - ( FOOTSTEPS RACING AWAY ) Is it him ? No . Lincoln . Clarke ? Commander , wh ... Octavia said you were both ... - You 've seen Octavia ? - Yeah . The few that survived the explosion are being pinned down by a sniper . - That 's why I 'm here . - ( SNIPER FIRE CONTINUES ) Come on . We need to get to the high ground . ( GRUNTS ) - ( SNIPER FIRE CONTINUES ) - ( GRUNTING CONTINUES ) ABBY : Don 't move . Don 't move . ( SCREAMS ) Your femoral artery is lacerated . The weight of the beam , it 's the only thing keeping you alive . ( CHUCKLES ) Hell of a bandage . - ( GROANS ) - We 'll figure it out . Abby , just go find your daughter . If I can get a tourniquet around your leg , it buys us more time . Go find Clarke . She 's not here . She 's ... fine . Lexa too . ( METAL CLANGING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) Lovejoy 's key card will get you into the armory . The guns are locked , but the guard has the key . - I can lure him away or ... - No . There 's no time . Once I get the guns , how do I get them to Level Five ? They 're watching every door . Maybe not . The mess hall has a trash chute . - A trash chute ? - There 's one on every level . Best part ? No radiation alarms . The hatches leak like crazy . So they put in these airlocks just to be safe . You get the guns , I 'll get them into the mess hall . You 're a natural-born revolutionary . My mom was the revolutionary . I 'm just trying to do what 's right . Be back here in 30 minutes . Maya , we were just on our way to see you . How can I help you , Mr. President ? They 're gonna come in a lot hotter next time . You know that , right ? All we got to do is hold the floor until Bellamy finds a way out . We 're gonna need more than a bucket of water and four guns to do that . CAGE : ( ON RADIO ) This is President Wallace talking to the people who just killed ten of my men . Jasper . I thought we 'd try something a little different this time . There 's only 20 minutes of oxygen in Maya 's suit . I know she 's a friend of yours . In 20 minutes , your friend will either suffocate or burn . But you can save her . All you have to do is surrender . MAN : Let 's do it ! ( WOMAN SOBS ) - ( SHOUTING ) - ( SNIPER FIRE CONTINUES ) We can 't wait anymore . Our people are dying down there . If we can get to the crater , we can tunnel in from the side . There 's no cover . I 'll do it . Get back ! Any other bad ideas ? Just one . - Now what , Sky Girl ? - Now we dig . Stay down . Stay down . Stay down . Move it . ( GRUNTING ) You 're okay . Listen to me . Fox is okay . Bellamy saved her . He 's gonna get some guns in here through the trash chute . If we can get guns in , we can get you out . No . We can 't . I dismantled the chute . I 'm sorry . I didn 't think we 'd be trying to open it ourselves . I can fix it . Thank you . - Go help him . - Harper ! I won 't let you die . I won 't let you surrender . ( GRUNTING ) ( SIGHS ) ( GRUNTS ) Marcus ? Marcus . Marcus , wake up . Open your eyes . You have to wake up . Marcus , open your eyes . I 'm so cold . I 'm right here . I 'm right here . I 'm okay . I 'm sorry , Marcus . I 'm so sorry . It 's not your fault , Abby . It is my fault . She 's my daughter . What are you talking about ? She knew . Clarke escaped before the attack . She knew it was coming . Yes . How could she do something like this ? Because she grew up on the Ark . She learned what to do from us . She let this happen . She could 've stopped it . She made a choice . Like executing people for stealing medicine and food . Like sucking the air from the lungs of 300 parents so they could save their children . Like floating the man you love to save your people . Yes . We have to answer for our sins , Abby . After everything we 've done , do we even deserve to survive ? She 's almost out of oxygen . It 's been 19 minutes . You 're not helping , Harper . Don 't worry . We 'll get it open , won 't we , Monty ? - Almost there . - Almost isn 't good enough . I just need to bypass the ... Screw this . - What the hell did you do ? - Cut the power to the motor . Help me . ( GRUNTING ) We can 't get leverage . - There 's someone in there . - They 're coming in ! - Bellamy . - Get her in here . Come on . Come on ! Go , go , go ! Hurry up . - ( GRUNTING ) - ( GASPING ) I got you . COMPUTER VOICE : Decontamination complete . All clear . ( DOOR OPENS ) Dad , what are you doing here ? What your mother would have done . Come here . Hey , listen to me . Clarke is coming with an army of Grounders . What ? We have to keep all of you safe until then . Well , don 't tell me Finn finally got his peace talks . Something like that . Come on . We got a lot of work to do . ( BIRD CRIES ) So much for the element of surprise . I 'll draw his fire . No . I will . ( SHOUTING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( HIGH-PITCHED FREQUENCY ) Drop the weapon . Just let him kill me , then take him out . Go on , Clarke . Please . Your people need you . You are my people . ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) Good shot . Did that make you feel better ? No . ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) - it 's no use . - Come on ! We can do this . ( HORN BLOWS IN DISTANCE ) Wait . Listen . Lincoln . He did it . We still can 't get them out . Want to bet ? Get back in there . It 's been 30 minutes . The girl is dead by now . I know that , Lieutenant . They 've made their choice . Go in strong . Take them alive if you can , but take them . Copy that . - More of the flash bangs ! - Fire in the hole ! - SOLDIER : Let 's go ! Go ! - ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) SOLDIER 2 : Clear . SOLDIER 3 : Clear . Mr. President . Find them . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) it 's all clear . - Won 't they see us ? - Relax . Maya took out the cameras . Yeah , well , we 're still sitting ducks in a group like this . You 're right . So we 're gonna split up . No . We do this together . We survive together . Bellamy 's right . Well , they don 't trust Maya anymore . Who the hell is gonna help us now ? They are . We 're going to hide you . Not everyone here agrees with Cage , not by a long shot . Come with , me . We 'll divide you along the way . Let 's go . It 'll be ok . Let 's go . You 're safe now . Quick , quick . Go this way . That way . Find your people . Find your people . Hey , we 're coming with you . No , you 're not . They still don 't know I 'm here , and I need to keep it that way . So what do we do ? Stay alive . Be ready to fight . War is coming . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus , wake up . Marcus , wake up . Wake up ! ( GRUNTS ) ( STRAINED GRUNTS ) Hold on there . Hold on . Hold on . - Don 't give up . - It 's still not working ! ( HORN BLOWS IN DISTANCE ) WOMAN : Sky People ! MAN : That group up there ! We saw the missile , heard the blast , figured you could use some help . Just in time . Thank you . There may be more down there . We need help ! All right . I need everybody on that rope . SINCLAIR : Make way . Let her through . ( MUFFLED VOICES ABOVE ) Marcus . Marcus . - Do you hear that ? - ( RUBBLE SHIFTING ) CARIS : We 've got two survivors . Abby , Kane , we 'll get you out of here . We 're gonna be okay . - ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) - MAN : Bring them up ! Over here . Here you go . You did it . Yeah . I had a little help . Kane needs blood . O-neg , right now . Abby , slow down . You 're bleeding . You need help , too . I 'm fine . GROUNDERS : ( CHANTING ) Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! What happened here will not stand . The mountain will fall . The dead will be avenged ! ( SHOUTING ) Enough ! That 's enough . There are still others in the wreckage . We heard them . Go to work ! JACKSON : Let 's get a rope up here . Haul them up . Let 's go ! Wait till I say . With our two people working together , we 're gonna win this war , Clarke . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) - You 're not ready . - I will not miss this fight . You 've done well , Octavia of the Sky People . Today you saved lives . Tomorrow you 'll take them . Now get my gear . We leave with the Commander . Wait . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) I thought you were dead . I 'm glad you 're not . You too . How 's Kane ? He 'll live . We could really use your help . I can 't . We 're leaving . I 've arranged for a caravan to take you and the wounded back to Camp Jaha . Clarke ... The sniper wasn 't wearing a Hazmat suit . The marrow treatment works . They 're gonna kill all my friends . Then you better hurry . I need you to do something for me . Don 't forget that we 're the good guys . It 's time . May we meet again . ( THEME MUSIC PLAYS ) ( English US - SDH )

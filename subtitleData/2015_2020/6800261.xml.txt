 Previously on " Falling water " ... It 's Topeka . It 's always Topeka . This is a geological analysis of your Belgian 's holdings . They 're worthless . A week ago , you offered the Belgian nine figures . Sometimes there are hidden layers of value . What do you dream about ? Woody . We have this mad , passionate love affair . Then I wake up , and it 's all a dream . Where is she ? I 'm not allowed to tell . They have me bound . Help me . How ? Don 't you want to heal your mother ? We can help you . She 's not gone . She 's still in there . But you have to get in the Van . He 's a tough old bear , and he 'll keep you safe . My sister and I had matching bears . Is it yours ? I have to talk to my mother . What you got there ? Nothing . Kind of a big ol ' mushroom . It 's mine . I found it . Okay . But you know not all mushrooms are good to eat , right ? You remember what happened to Babar 's father , the king of the elephants ? He ate a mushroom that turned him green . Then he died . Yeah , that 's right . Then Babar went to the city to find a rich lady to live with and to buy him nice clothes and a car . You 've got an interesting take on things . You know that ? But let 's get rid of that one , because it 's no good . Capisce ? Capisce . Woody ? Do you ever wonder what you want to be when you grow up ? Sometimes . You know , sometimes I think there 's just this path waiting for me . Other times , I think I should just buy a boat and be a fisherman . What about you , Tess ? What are you gonna be ? I 'm gonna be Babar . Tessie . Hey ! Charlotte said you might be coming . You 're lucky you beat the weather . It 's supposed to pour later . Is mom in with a group ? Just finishing up orientation . Stilling the mind . You remember the way . Yeah . Good to see you . Welcome back . So one last thought before we head back into the evening air . We are not here seeking transmogrification . We are instead seeking reunion with the divided self so that we may know ourselves in full . And from that journey , we will find true wisdom . Order and entropy are funny things . At scale , they 're practically interchangeable . So how do we know one from the other ? And does it makes a difference ? The only cost is confusion , and that 's perpetual . " The way that can be spoken of is not the true way . " I counted the turns after we left the L.I.E. Two rights , a left , a 3 1 / 2 minute gap , and two lefts . That must have taken a lot of concentration . If you 're hungry ... Might not get another chance for a while . What 's she doing here ? Hey , I 'm talking to you . We hear you . You promised me answers . I promised to help you reach your mother . How ? Lie down . No . We 're not gonna hurt you . We 've gone to a lot of trouble . What hell am I doing here ? You don 't know anything about my mother . I know your mother . I know your mother . I know your mother . We all do . We see her in our dreams . She told us about you . How you 'd wake up early and make breakfast so she could sneak out and make her sculptures . How , after your father left , she told you to go with him . She said , " go be the hero of your own life . " And you said to her , " a hero doesn 't leave . " How do you know that ? I see her in my dreams . We all do . We 've got thunderstorm warnings issued for both Putnam and duchess ... But the storm 's biggest target ... We need to talk . Can 't you just let me go crazy in peace ? You 're not crazy . I think Woody 's invading your dreams . I always thought my dreams were just mine . But then I met a woman who had the ability to enter my dreams , and I realized she wasn 't the only one . Okay . I think you dream of Woody because Woody is entering your dreams and manipulating them so that you think you 're in love with him . They 're such wonderful dreams . I know . I 'm sorry . It makes sense . I mean ... it doesn 't make any sense , but it fits . I need your help . There 's someone I love in trouble , and Woody knows things . What would I have to do ? My god , you 're a beautiful thing . I love you too . Such a nice surprise to have you here . Picking up or dropping off ? It 's for my mother . Can I go out the back ? All roads lead to the middle . Hello , maman . I found this . You gave it to my son . You can 't have that ! No toys in school ! And now we 're late . I 'm sorry , mom . Shh , listen . Come on . Close those eyes . Can you see the dancers ? I see them . Close your eyes . Let yourself sink in . Breathe . Are you awake ? Yes . Are you awake ? Yes . Are you awake ? Yes . Open your eyes . Are you ready ? Sure . Are you ready to let us help you ? What is it you want to say to your mother ? I ... I don 't know . You know . Is that my mother 's robe ? I was cold . Please take it off . Your mother 's got you captured and pinned . And the worst part ? She 's not even here . She 's my mother . And one day , she 's gonna wake up . She 's gonna wake up . And then what ? One day , she wakes up . And then what ? Aren 't you a sight for sore eyes ? Let 's get a table in the back . Question time . You didn 't need to involve her . She has a right to know . Baby , don 't worry about this . He 's crazy . Focus . Torture is not an effective tool . But psychological stress is . And since none of this is real , it 's all psychological . What is Topeka ? A name . Places need names . Our dreams together , the whole megillah , it needed a name . Topeka ? A good place to dig for roots . I know you think you 're in control of things , but you 're not . You 're a chess piece , a pawn , a knight if you 're lucky . What does that make you ? I 'm the buffalo wings at halftime . I know you 're there . I 've been sent to talk to you . Open the door . You 're messing with things that you don 't understand . Whatever . You 're not even awake . It 's okay . It 's me . It 's gonna be okay . Come on . No sleeping at the table . What ? Did you think we were done ? Sit down . So how was the reunion ? Hugs and kisses all around ? - What did you do to her ? Hey , I didn 't put her there , and I 'm not holding her there . But you needed to know that she 's out there , give you something to strive for . That was her . Can I get some drinks ? Okay . For most citizens of the world , they 're either dreaming ... Or awake . And these two things stay far apart . But for people with a little know-how , people like me , there 's no gap at all . They can walk like an ant on the rim of one glass and onto the other . You , though , have the rare ability to spill your waking into your dreaming so that they overlap and mix together , like the time in the lobby of the firm . She really was gorgeous in red . Martini 's yours . How do I find her ? Which half of her ? I was wondering when you 'd surface . You hypnotize me ? There 's a thin line between dreaming and waking . We simply ushered you across . What size are you ? - 9 1 / 2 . These are just sixes and sevens . The line 's not hard and fast . It 's more like ... Passing through a waterfall . Really , it 's just a two-sided organic system . On the surface , individual blades of grass . Underneath , an intertwined mass of roots we can barely comprehend . What do you want from me ? The same thing you want from us . To help you find your way to your mother . Let 's go eat . Lie down . We need to start the session . No . It 's for your own mental health . I 'm not your patient . Why do you always have to be so difficult ? You have unhealthy patterns . Stop fighting . I know what 's good for you . I love you . You 're in my dream . You invaded mine first . You called out in your sleep , like you did when you were little . Sorry . You remember what you were dreaming about ? No . Well , that 's too bad . I 'm gonna go out to the car . Got some magnesium . That 'll help me be less restless . Be careful . Sounds like that storm 's almost here . Here . You 're bleeding . Am I awake ? Yes . Prove it . - I can 't . But you used to know the difference . Here , I 'll take that . Why am I here ? That 's a rather pedestrian question . I want to help you reunite with your girl . Why ? Because she 's a person being held against her will in a basement to the point of madness , because the people holding her are the ones with the green sneakers . They want to unleash the same kind of anarchy on humanity that your dreams have unleashed on you . How ? The boy . He 's a very special boy . Huge untapped power . Nine figures ' worth ? More . Here . The first step to finding your girl . If you 're gonna sell me the fish , tell me the price . I thought you loved her . Give me the envelope . You still think you can do this on your own . Wars have two sides . Those who don 't pick one get smashed in the middle . Now , now . You don 't have to be alone . But you 're not welcome here . I don 't get any ? Yours is back there . This isn 't real . This is a dream . Say something . She 's waiting . What is it I 'm supposed to say ? What do you want to say ? You 're the one with the power . You brought her to the forest . You made her cry out . I did it ? Start small , something simple . Are you gonna eat those fries ? Keep going . They look delicious , no ? I just might help myself to the burger next unless you 're gonna eat it . Right , okay . Mine , then . You don 't know what you 're missing . You keep this up , I 'm gonna eat the whole thing . You just ... you just gonna sit there and say nothing ? Like always ? This is bullshit . Are you sure you want to leave that much unsaid ? You can 't help me . You can 't help my mother . You 're going in circles . You 'll be back . You 're leaking . Thank you . Can 't sleep ? Don 't want to . Yeah , I tried that once . Made it six days . And then what ? They arrested me . Wandering in the middle of sixth Avenue . I didn 't think I was in sixth Avenue . I thought I was in the beach , dancing to dusty Springfield . Sounds nice . It was cold and rocky . There was this craggy old tree . It all seemed so real . Maybe it was . How the hell did you make it six days ? You really should sleep . So should you . When you find that cold , rocky beach , look behind the tree . There 's a bottle of Margaux . Like an ant on the rim of a glass . Ooh . Why are you doing this ? - You bring it on yourself . Stop fighting . I know what 's good for you . I love you . This is my dream . Such a disappointment . Stop . You stop . Where is he ? Where 's my son ? You have no son . I found his bear . You know where he is . At least you 're free of disease , the way you open yourself up . You 're lying to me . I see him . You know I do , in my dreams . Stop it . You know I see him . Tessie , I 'm warning you . No ! Tell me where my son is . Tell me what you 've done with him . He 's not yours . That 's a lie . I gave birth to him . I 'm his mother ! You were never supposed to have known . You convinced me I was crazy . Where is he ? Where ? Where ? We don 't know . He was taken . Stolen . He was in transit , and someone stole him from us . Who has him now ? We don 't know . Hello . Did you make it back to the city all right ? Yeah . I 'm sorry you couldn 't stay . Will I still see you for brunch on the 15th ? Sure . It never did rain , did it ? No . Anyway , I love you , darling , and I always will . I thought maybe you snuck out for a bite . Here we are , same as always . There 's no one else here . Not even you . I need you to meet me halfway . Wake up . I 'm here . I 'm waiting . Come on . Do it now , ma . Wake up ! I hate her . When I was eight years old , I ate a poison mushroom and went into a coma for three days . When I woke up , the funky old priest at my bedside asked me if I saw god . I told him no , but I did hear dusty Springfield .

 Previously on Cleverman . You have destroyed everything . We 've managed to harvest and fertilize very impressive embryos . - You dont 't send her back ? - Back ? To her home , her dimension . You go in there armed and it 'll be carnage . It 's the idea . - 30 Millions . - And what do you want in return ? Your brother . All right , fellas , nothing is gonna get in or out without us knowing . Oi , you two . You two girls . Get over here . You , come here . I need to talk to you . Latani , we need to go . Oi ! You ever shot one of these ? Your turn . " Take Me Home " playing Boy or girl ? What 's your professional opinion ? I don 't really care as long as it 's healthy . I 'd say that 's healthy . Just feels a bit tight . It 's natural for you to feel worried considering our history . I 'm not being a paranoid pregnant woman . I 'm just saying it as a doctor . You 've never been pregnant before . Look , you found the top IVF clinic . We 're both fit and healthy . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sure you 're right . You off to work ? Uh , no , I 've got the day off , so I thought I might go shopping . Shopping ? Yeah , not for the baby or anything . I 'm not going to look at little baby clothes or cots . No . Well , have fun not doing any of those things . Can you pull this off ? Only one way to find out . Take Ash to somewhere beautiful for me . I am the Cleverman . I am the Cleverman . Oi , I want you out . - Nerida . - No , you heard what I said . I want you gone . Can we at least talk about this ? There 's nothing to say . Nerida , please . This redevelopment deal really gonna happen ? If the numbers crunch our way , just might . It 's looking pretty good . So everyone in the Zone gets their own place ? That 's the idea . - Latani , too ? - Everyone . Cool , huh ? Oh ! No , no , no , no . Hey . What is it ? Hey , what happened ? What happened ? Nerida ? I 'm here . Calm down , calm down . It 's okay . Calm down . That 's it . Calm down . It 's Waruu . I just don 't know who he is anymore . I 'm so sorry . Ilythia Clinic . Sorry , the number you requested is not available . Please check the number before dialing again . Oi ! Look at me . You want money ? Here . Knock yourself out . Oh , growing on trees now , is it ? Yeah , Jimmy saw it in you . The jeals one . The corruptible . The crow . You 're the one that named me Waruu . I didn 't choose it . You can choose how you behave . I 'm trying to build something here ... a future for my people . That 's what I 'm doing , not smoking myself to death . You want all this so bad ? You 're prepared to sacrifice your own brother . None of this is his fault . He was born into it . - Still trying to protect him . - I 'm worried about you . Well , that 's a first . You were never there . You didn 't raise me . You were too stoned . When you did have your shit together , you looked after Koen . He 's not even your son . I 'm your son . You loved him because you felt so guilty about what you did . I had to look out for myself . You point the finger at me ? You killed my father . You crashed the car . If you weren 't high that night , my father would still be alive . You got away with murder and you call me the crow ? You 're the reason I 'm not the Cleverman . You 're the reason I 'm the way I am . You 're the reason all this shit happened . If Dad were still alive , I wouldn 't have to sacrifice anyone . It 's not too late for you . Please . Waruu , whatever you 've been promised , it 's not worth killing for . I 'm glad you 've got cancer . Coming up ... Stay tuned for more " Cleverman " . Don 't need sticks when you 've got guns , eh ? All humans of the Zone , you have 24 hours to vacate . Please proceed to the checkpoint immediately . The Containment Authority can no longer ... - Maliyan ! - ... guarantee your safety . This is not a drill . All humans of the Zone , you have 24 hours to vacate . Please proceed to the checkpoint immediately . Containment Authority officers will assist you in your relocation . You 've gotta go , boy . Get out . I said , get out . Get out ! This morning I officially signed the orders requiring all humans to vacate the area commonly referred to as the Zone . The Zone is a safe haven for murderers and violent criminals who refuse to assimilate , and we 're going to dismantle that haven . Our citizens expect to feel safe in the streets . People do not want to fear for their lives . They 're going to clean the place out . It 's been on the cards for a while now . What ? Kill the Hairies and chuck everyone else out on the street ? Who does Matthews think he is ? He wants what you want . There are international consortia lining up to redevelop the Zone . Matthews has been working behind the scenes to make this happen . Cleaning out the Zone is the first step . Yeah , cleaning it out of people . We both know his scheme is never gonna happen . You have the money and the right to first development as original occupants of the land . Well , that 's bullshit . The whole place is gonna be razed in the next 24 hours . Don 't worry about Matthews . He 's the minister , the one with the power . We 'll get screwed like we always get screwed . I have cameras everywhere , so I don 't think he 'll be minister for much longer . Here 's what you need to take the power from Matthews . You have the money now . You can help your people , but I 'll need you to deliver the collateral for the loan . I want your brother . All humans of the Zone , you have 24 hours to vacate . Please proceed to the checkpoint immediately . The Containment Authority can no longer guarantee your safety . Yeah . Yeah , we have moved up the time frame . The land should be clear by the end of the week . God ! Good . No , I 'm fine . I 'll speak to you tomorrow . Come on , Alinta . Hurry up . - You can 't be serious . - We 've talked about this . Just ' cause Dad 's acting like family is nothing ... This is not about your father . Latani 's family ! You 're gonna need a coat . I 'm not leaving her . You don 't understand what 's going on here ! This is not a drill . All humans of the Zone , you have 24 hours to vacate . Your mom 's right . Please proceed to the checkpoint immediately . All humans of the Zone ... All humans of the Zone , you have 24 hours to vacate . Please proceed to the checkpoint immediately . This is not a drill . You 're a warrior now , brother . You 're one of us . You 're family . This is how the old people used to prepare for war . Not long now . All humans of the Zone , you have 24 hours to vacate . IDs out , people . Subhumans should not be in this line . Any subhuman in this line will be detained . Please proceed to the checkpoint immediately . This is not a drill . Hey ! Hey , clear the line ! Come on , keep it moving . Oi ! We 're going now . Come on , Gub . We 've got to get out of here . All humans of the Zone ... I 'm not gonna bloody beg . Please proceed to the checkpoint immediately . Max , wait ! Latani . You need to go . I know what you said to your mom . This is no place for you . I won 't leave you . I said go , Alinta . I 'm not leaving you . We 'll make a stand together . What 's that supposed to mean ? This isn 't some bullshit political rally . This is my life . - They will kill us . - I get that . No , you don 't get that . I don 't have a choice . I can shave down , but that doesn 't mean I 'll feel safe . I will be scared every single day , wondering if I will be found out . - Not all humans hate you . - There 's nowhere for me . I 'm alone , so you need to go , Alinta . - Go ! - No . I 'm fighting for you whether you like it or not ! I 'm not leaving you ! Did you hear me ? - No , you need to go ! - I 'm not leaving you ! Hey , come with me now , both of you . - No objections . - No . Nerida ... I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm asking you to trust me . Please . Coming up ... Stay tuned for more " Cleverman " . Hey , there 's no rush . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Doesn 't leave much to the imagination . This will destroy Matthews . - And the CA . - Not the CA . It 's a private company . What ? Yeah , a long time ago now . The government outsourced itself to Jarrod Slade . - No one said boo . - Slade ? He owns it . Well , at least one of his shell companies does . Why 'd he give me this ? You must have something very valuable to him . Slade gets what he wants , one way or another . And then he has this way of turning it around and making it what you want as well . It 's pretty hard to resist . That 's why you slept with me . No . That sweet moment of indiscretion was all about your ass . I liked you , Waruu , and Slade always has , too . But you have to ask yourself why . I have a story to file . - You going ? - I 'm leaving . Where are you ? Neat trick . Very powerful . I don 't exactly feel powerful . I know who locked your friend Kora up . Had Jimmy wrapped around his finger . It was his lab you found her in . - What guy ? - You know him . His name 's Slade . He was in your bar . How do you know all about this ? He offered me money for your head . And that 's what the beach was about . He 's the CA . He 's been disappearing Hairies and we have to stop him . We ? It was his man that killed your friend . Well , then we should pay him a visit . All humans of the Zone , you have 24 hours to vacate . Please proceed to the checkpoint immediately . This is not a drill . All human inhabitants of the Zone should proceed to the exit immediately . Ensure you are carrying a valid human ID pass . All humans of the Zone , please proceed to the checkpoint immediately . The Containment Authority can no longer guarantee your safety . This is not a drill . All humans of the Zone ... Excuse me , I 'm just looking for the Ilythia Clinic . Um , the Ilythia Clinic . It 's for fertility . We 're dermatologists . No , it used to be right here in this office . Been here for five years . Sorry , I ... Oh , must be a mistake . Humans of the Zone , you have less than 12 hours to vacate . Please approach the gates in a calm and orderly fashion with your IDs at the ready . Ensure you are carrying a valid human ID pass . Go on . Keep on moving . There you go . Can 't even recognize you now . You look like Mom . Now , if we get pulled up , you let me do the talking , all right ? Let 's go . You realize you 're gonna be the last survivor of your species ? ... closure of the walled community known as the Zone . What an exalted position . What a difference from that wailing , hysterical mother you were when you were arrested on the street . Suspected subhumans have been detained on sight . Look at you now . Now you 're glorious . Mmm . And I made you . There have been several attempts by subhuman dissidents to escape and a subhuman male has been shot dead on sight following a brutal assault ... That 's too hard . It 's too tight . Stop it . Stop it . Stop it . Go back . Go back . Go . Give me your gun . You can 't die . I can . Jarrod , the Ilythia Clinic doesn 't exist . Of course it does . You have the baby to prove it . I was right there where it was . It 's gone . They must have moved premises . These things happen . You 're hormonal , my darling . No , this has got nothing to do with being hormonal . There 's no trace of it . There 's no website . There 's no medical journal articles and no listing of a Dr. Everick . All the things I looked up when I was researching , they 've just ... they 've gone . There 'll be a logical explanation . Don 't fob me off ! I may be pregnant , but I haven 't lost my brain . There 's something very wrong with the baby ! I need you to cancel your meeting or whatever you 're doing , and I need you to come home right now ! Please come home , Jarrod . Jarrod ? Later , I promise . Gentlemen . Welcome . Jarrod ? You killed Ash . Waruu , we don 't need to play this game . You 're the true Cleverman . This guy , he 's just Jimmy 's little joke against us . What did you do to him ? Other than the odd saliva extraction , he 's unharmed . And the others in the containment centers ? What about them ? I 'm a man of science , Waruu . I 've taken Darwin 's theory of natural selection and given it a reboot . I 'm the living proof . An injection of this could give you another 100 years of life , maybe 150 . And not just life , but enhanced life . I took one dose of this and I feel so alive . Help yourself . The world 's at a tipping point where only the fit will survive and I 'm ensuring there 'll be at least some of us left . You and I , we 're the custodians of the future . We could change this world together . You could finish what Jimmy couldn 't . Your people have 50,000 years of research locked up in stories , knowledge of the land , how to live with it , not try to tame it . I need your help to unlock that knowledge . If that means the odd sacrifice along the way , then , yeah , I 'm willing to make it . Are you ? He ... hey . Finish him . What ? They shot my sister ! She was just a kid . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . How much did you get for my family ? I 'm ... I 'm sorry . This doesn 't solve anything . I 'm sorry ! Oh , please ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sor ... please don 't ! Come on , dog ! Come on , dog ! Get the hell off me ! Please , no . Ah ! You want our blood ? You want our blood ? That 's what you 're really after , isn 't it ? Our Hairy blood ? Well , get ready to lose yours ! This dirty human came and sold us out ! You see ? This one deserves to die ! All right , dogs ? All right , everyone . Back to your stations . We got until tomorrow morning yet . They may all kill each other by then . Job done . There 's no need to rush things . Let 's see what you 've got in here . If Jimmy hadn 't messed me about , we wouldn 't be here like this . But I need access to the dreaming . It 's not yours to have . Aah ! All right , bring it in ! Come on , come on , come on ! Come on ! I 'm only gonna say this once ! What are you scared of ? The time for change is now ! Today is the day we take back what belongs to us ! I have successfully negotiated ownership of this land for all of us ! We have title . No one 's gonna take it away from us ! We will never be moved on . This will be a safe place for us , our children , and our children 's children . Today , we say good-bye to despair , to greed , to violence ! Well ... sorry about that fella , but he was a cancer that had to be removed . We need team players now . We will build here ... a community that will show the rest of the world the way forward . Black , white , human , Hairy ... we are one . We are united . We are family now and forever ! Did you hear what I said ? Say something ! I have done this for you . Everything I have done has been for you ! Hey ! Come on ! Harry , brother , this is everything we 've ever worked for . Nerida , you get this , right ? Please , darling . Mom ! Don 't you come near me ! Here , here . Hey , hey , hey ! _ _ Come on , then . _ Ahh . Yes ! That is the coolest thing I have ever seen ! Pick it up from under the wheel . Ready ? Use your legs , boys . Let go , let go , let go . Good work . - You all right , Aunty ? - Yeah , I 'm good . Keep going , boy . Bring up the oil drums ! Barricade the front now ! Hey , Blair ! You all ri boss ? They 're coming ! They 're coming ! The CA guards are coming ! They 're coming !

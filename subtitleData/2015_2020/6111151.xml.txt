 The conflict began from a single spark , and has grown into a massive war . A multitude of people had myriad hopes and dreams that were at odds , resulting in great tragedy . This is a sad thing indeed . This war has brought me great sorrow . I feel both shame and a deep regret over our use of power that was not meant for us . I hereby ... succeed the previous emperor , Rayregalia Vers Rayvers , and name myself Empress of the Vers Empire . I also take Count Cruhteo , member of the Orbital Knights ' 37 Clans , to be my husband . We , the imperial family of the Vers Empire , wish to make peace with Earth ! In the name of the Empress of Vers , I command all Orbital Knights who are listening to this transmission to cease hostilities immediately ! Impossible ! Wasn 't Princess Asseylum going to found a new dynasty with Lord Troyard ? What about the all-out offensive on the UFE ? Wait . Do nothing for now . We 'll see which way the wind blows . I should have known . Lord Troyard was a lowborn Terran . His attempts to inveigle his way into the imperial family are offensive . What is the meaning of this ? ! Sir Harklight , we 're returning to base ! Lord Slaine ... Shooting Star of Yesteryear . Why are they still fighting ? ! The princess just declared that they must stop ! The moonbase 's forces are still itching for action . Stay sharp , everyone ! The battle isn 't over ! Did you hear that ? Yeah ... That Princess Asseylum just now ... Um , that Empress Asseylum was the princess I remember . Yeah ... So it 's just as Lt. Kaizuka predicted . Then that cease-fire order was also genuine . The enemies in front of us don 't seem interested in laying down arms , though . Any word from HQ ? No instructions , ma 'am . So it 's " continue operation . " Neither the moonbase nor Landing Castles are showing any intent to cease hostilities . Empress Asseylum 's location ? That transmission originated from Count Mazuurek 's Landing Castle . She 's abandoned the Moon ? Or has there been a split ? Count Troyard , what of Empress Asseylum 's order ? Order ? What order ? My apologies , Lord . I 'm surprised . I didn 't think her capable of that . Princess Lemrina . What is truly important is the imperial family 's blood . So long as you still have Aldnoah activation privileges , can you not still make your dream come true ? I am not going anywhere . After all , this is the only place that I can call home . So please ... Yes , of course . Your kindness is touching , Princess Lemrina . Let 's be off . Of course . It 's lovely ... Was that a terrible thing to say ? I have seen a great many things while flying among those lights . Many things ? The future ... All of it , both good and bad . Only the immediate future can be seen . I thought that I knew everything . Many things unfolded exactly as I foresaw . However ... I failed to see what was truly important . - Rearm it . - Yes , sir ! Lord Troyard ! What is the meaning of this ? ! Why would Princess Asseylum say such a thing ? ! Milord Slaine ... Patch this through the command center . I will address all our forces . The deployed Stygis Squadron , as well . Yes , sir ! Hear me ! Get clear of the moonbase in the next 10 minutes ! Surrender to the UFE along with the Landing Castles ! We will abandon the moonbase ! Have you gone mad ? ! Slaine ! Princess Lemrina ... I apologize for the many wrongs ... I have done you . Slaine ? May you remain in good health . Harklight , please escort Princess Lemrina to a shuttle . As you wish . No ! Slaine ! Highness , please come with me . I won 't go ! Slaine ! Slaine ! Multiple new signatures detected leaving the moonbase . Reinforcements ? No , they 're ... They 're leaving the combat zone , ma 'am . The moonbase ... It 's fallen ? Did we beat them ? No ... They 're making it self-destruct ? Sir Harklight ? See to the shuttle 's defense ! Sir Harklight ! Harklight . What are you doing ? Turn back . I thought I ordered you to surrender . Harklight ! Stygis Squadron ! Don 't act without orders ! Enemy reinforcements closing in . 10 o 'clock . Angle of elevation , - 10 ! Stand by to engage ! Don 't ! We no longer have any hope of winning ! Don 't throw your lives away ! I made my peace with death long ago , Lord . Please allow me this one selfish act . Surrender , Harklight ! I beg your pardon , Milord Slaine ... But I cannot comply with that order . Here they come ! All units , scatter ! Come on ! How could they do this ? Damn it all ! What 's that ? Those moves ... You 're right , Harklight . We can 't let it end like this . There is still something that I must do ! I 've come for you , Slaine Troyard . Let 's settle this once and for all , Inaho Kaizuka ! No matter how much you predict my attacks , there 's no point if you can 't escape . You 're the one who can 't escape ! Opening contact channel . Decrypting protocols . I don 't think it will do any good , but I 'll ask anyway . Surrender , Slaine Troyard . You came all this way to say such a pointless thing to me , Inaho Kaizuka ? No , I have a different objective . I 'm glad to hear that ! Don 't disappoint me ! Damn ... My monitors are damaged ? I know ... You can 't do any more high-load processing . Cut all predictive imagers . I no longer ... have any need for a future ! 2 o 'clock ! Angle of elevation , 5 ! Incoming ! All ahead , emergency speed ! Come about , 060 ! Coming about , 060 ! Load canister shot ! Fire once targets are locked ! Wow ... Nao 's combat data is stored in the tactical data link . All units , refer to that and – . - Yuki ! - I 'm okay ! Barouhcruz , member of the Orbital Knights 37 Clans ! Do you mind if I cut in ? Count Barouhcruz ... 8 o 'clock ! Angle of elevation , - 25 ! Incoming ! - Intercept ! - I 've got this ! Remaining rounds , 3 ... There 's nothing to be gained by continuing to fight . Agreed . But there 's nothing to be lost by it , either . Giving in to despair is a foolish choice . You just don 't get it ! This is the choice I wanted the most ! Slice them up ! Rayet ! Fool ! Radar returns approaching at high speed ! What ? It 's the Tharsis ... and a UFE Kataphrakt ! That 's ... Rayet ! Three-direction crossfire ! MRSI , neutralize target , auto fire ! I always ... I always hated that color ! Sir Harklight ! The drones are on autopilot ! Use the boulders ! We can limit the direction of their attack ! Are you all right ? Yes . I only lost an arm . Sir Harklight . Battle status ? Including myself , 3 Stygis Masters remain , as well as some 6 Slaves . The rest have been downed by the UFE . I have fired most of my bullets as well . Count Barouhcruz . The Octantis ' right arm is nonfunctional . It must have been damaged in that last attack . These Terran warriors are not without skill . Yes . It is Lord Slaine 's birthplace , after all . " Do not try to fight an Olympian sandstorm , " eh ? We seem to have misread the winds . Let 's have another go ! I shall join you . 9 o 'clock ! Angle of elevation , 20 ! Enemy formation closing in ! All guns , take aim ! Kataphrakt platoons ! All units , fire at will ! I 'll act as a drogue chute . It will stabilize you . You intend to die with me ? You 'll burn up . Kataphrakt frames are high density . They 'll work well enough as ablative shielding . Impossible ... It can 't be done . Really ? I guess we 'll see . Sis , look ! A shooting star ! Look at this . Aldnoah Reactor ♪ 1 , constructed as a sign of goodwill between Earth and Vers , is scheduled to be activated today . We 're told that Empress Asseylum herself will participate in the activation ceremony . Research into making activation privileges universal so that anyone can do it is still ongoing . When that happens , industries using Aldnoah will develop and will help greatly with Earth 's reconstruction . And as the nation that produces Aldnoah , it should also prove to be an effective means for the Vers Empire to earn foreign capital . Dr. Troyard 's theories have already been proven , so we should see them put into practice in the near future . It 's ironic that Slaine Troyard , the son of that same Dr. Troyard , plotted the assassination of Empress Asseylum , which was the trigger for Interplanetary War II . Slaine Troyard 's death allowed Earth and Vers to conclude a friendship treaty . Yes , but there are still Mars Knights who occupy territory on Earth . One goal of Empress Asseylum 's visit is peace negotiations with those knights . Here 's hoping that we 'll be seeing the prompt return of that occupied territory . In the hope that this light will be a bridge of peace between Earth and Vers , awaken ! How are you feeling ? You don 't seem too bad . You really should eat your meals , though . The warden has been complaining . Your move . Your eye . Is that from when I shot you ? An analytical engine . I had a bio-device implanted that was neuro-linked to my cranial nerves . But I had it removed . I don 't need it anymore . Hasn 't it been long enough ? I deceived , I stole , I killed . I sacrificed many of my own . Please . No . You 're going to live . Why ? ! Why did you save me ? ! I have one more favor to ask of you . It wasn 't me . It 's what Princess Asseylum wants . Please ... Please , save Slaine . Save Slaine Troyard . Save him from the chains of misery . Please . Seylum asked me ... to save you . My goodness ... The blue sky and sea go on forever ! It 's so beautiful ... I 'm told that the blue sky is the result of something called Rayleigh scattering . You 're quite well-informed . When I visited Earth last time , a Terran I had befriended was kind enough to teach me . It 's a lovely memory .

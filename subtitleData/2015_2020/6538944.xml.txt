And every scientist knows that , In order to achieve the same results in an experiment , Every variable must be identical . That means setting off an atomic bomb in the same location A-and opening that rift or whatever it was . I can 't emphasize this enough - - We cannot let her do this . Then , we 'll just have to stop her . Which means stopping an atom bomb . Not just any bomb - - The bombs used in the isodyne test . Those were manufactured by roxxon . After 1946 , The two remaining warheads were put in storage . We 've infiltrated a roxxon facility . They have several facilities , And the location of each is classified . There 's no way to know which one is housing the bombs . Well , that 's ... Not entirely accurate . Mr. Stark 's rivalry with hugh jones is ever ongoing . He 's had extensive research done On roxxon and all its facilities . Call it corporate espionage . There is one particular roxxon location A few hours outside of los angeles , Which I believe would be the most likely place . Why is it our leading contender ? The security . Compared to the other facilities , it 's quite intense . I believe the word " impenetrable " was used . In my experience , nothing is impenetrable . That may well be , But mr . Stark has never been able To get anyone inside this particular location . The elevator requires a special key - - One that 's impossible to duplicate . We don 't need a key . We 'll blow the hinges off the door . Which would trigger the explosives set inside them And kill us all . We 'll drill into the lock . Which would pierce the acid core , Spraying into the elevator , and kill us all . We 'll dig a hole - - Which would trip the 3,000-volt mechanism underground And kill us all . And kill us all . So , a key , you say ? We cannot steal atomic bombs . It 's not stealing if your company made them , dear . Well , tell that to hugh jones . If the council found out , I - - If we obtain more zero matter , cal , Then the council answers to us . This is insane . People thought galileo was insane . This plan will work , cal . It will work . Look at me . You have seen what I can do With just a small amount of zero matter . I mean , can you imagine ? Just imagine what we could accomplish If we had the power to bend the world to our will .

I haven 't had a day off since pearl harbor . How is your disguise department shaping up ? For you ? Low on evening gowns . Why ? I need to sneak into hugh jones ' office . At roxxon ? Are you sure that 's a good idea ? Didn 't you meet him last year in new york ? I 'm sure he doesn 't pay that much attention To every woman he meets . Oh . He 'd remember you , peg .

Once we 're inside the building , We 'll need to find the freight elevator And use the key to access the lower levels , Where roxxon stores its highly classified items .

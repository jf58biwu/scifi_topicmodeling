 First we made contact then we made war . We came for the resources and drove out the alien horde . 170 million human lives were lost in that war against the Greyskins . But then , the ore ran out . ICP withdrew their security forces from Sector Nine . Now It 's galactic slum full of stranded and starving refugees . They can choose to die out slowly try to escape and risk termination by ICP . They left us all wide open . The Greyskins will be back and we 're only human . Now you listen to me , okay ? I need you to be a big girl , all right ? You hide under there And you don 't come out for anyone . Anybody . That means me , you understand ? Promise ? Captain Ashbrook ? Captain Ashbrook . What have you done with my men ? I 've taken a certain measure of collateral to ensure the safety of my people . You fool . What do you want ? Fuel . As much as our core will hold . Food and medicine . How do I know you haven 't killed my men ? You have five minutes before I start executing your men . Maybe I 'll start with your son . Brody . Brody ! Where 's Kai ? That 's not important , Jonah . What 's important is your survival . Your life is in the hands of your Captain now . Let 's hope he is a reasonable man . Why are you helping shifters ? Helping shifters ... We saved them from an agonising death at the hands of smugglers . And in return they 've agreed to protect us . It 's more than I can say for most humans . They will give us a future . A home . That 's what they promised you ? In exchange for what ? Your silence as they massacre people ? Incredible , aren 't they ? They barely feel pain yet they sense all your feelings . They have no politics , No religion . No gods . Living on their home world has helped us evolve into a certain place of understanding . Now we have a common enemy and together we will find a place to be whole again . Word gets out that a Niner faction is helping Greyskins ICP will declare it an act of war . They will exterminate all of you . Is that what you want for your people ? Let me show you something . Now you see what has been taken from me ? From all of us ? You call me traitor but I 'm not the one that 's forgotten where I come from . You 're a Niner , Jonah . And like some of us , you have a gift . These people you call family would have you you bury who you truly are . Is that who you fight for ? Your father 's running out of time . My father 's going to kill you . The Niner war . What unit did you serve in ? What ? What unit were you in the Niner war ? WHAT UNIT ? Bloodhounds forty-second . Bloodhounds forty-second , you know that . Sorry , Richards . Had to be sure . What the hell 's going on ? We 're code Red . Greyskin infiltration . Greyskin ? Shifters ? They got Leanne . Where 's the security force ? We 're it . The rest are on the Kiev held hostage . They going to kill them if we don 't give them fuel . With shifters on board to be planning something . We 've got to find them and we 've got to kill them . The others ? Focus on the station . If it 's shifters it could be anyone . It 's not anyone . Sound the evacuation . Shut down all access to engineering . They 'll be going for the core . All personnel aboard the ICP Dakota must evacuate immediately . Please move in an orderly fashion to the nearest pod bay . This is not a drill . All personnel aboard the ICP Dakota must evacuate immediately . Please move in an orderly fashion to the nearest pod bay . This is not a drill . The Captain has made his move . Now you know what we have to do . Look what they 've done to you . You think they Greyskins will find you a home ? It 's a lie . I know it 's hard to see , Jonah . But Dimi is a good man . He 's doing what he has to for us to survive . He 's blinded by his grief . And they will use that . Then what hope is there for us ? Do you remember where it was they found you as a child ? In the ashes of Croatan , or the moon of Eora ? Do you remember your parents ? Do you remember family ? My family is on that station . Then I 'm sorry . Sara , move aside . Your Captain has made his choice . Get him up . What are you doing ? Ashbrook . I warned you . Now look . Brody . Stay strong kid . Sorry , Cap . NO ! What will it be , Captain ? You coward . You don 't get it , Captain , do you ? You 're one less watchtower in the sky . One last chance to warn others of the storm that 's coming . Is this station worth dying for Captain ? Captain ? Captain , you 're leaving no choice . Let 's see how long she can hold her breath . Preparing to depressurise Airlock B. Hey shifter ... Dimi , this is not who we are . Stop ! Stop ! Look closely . Depressurising Airlock B. Enough ... ENOUGH ! Override . Repressurising Airlock B. Copy Richards . Fuel the Kiev . Refuelling now . That wasn 't too hard , was it Captain ? Shit . The boy believes you 're valuable . The girl however ... not . ♪ scream ♪ ♪ scream ♪ I should have known better , Richards . You 're going to be all right . Hey ! Put your arm around me . We 're getting of this station , okay ? We 're going to get Mum , we 'll get Maya and we 're getting off this station . Son . I can 't . You have to promise me you 'll look after Maya . I promise . You 're my son , Jonah . You were always one of us . You 're my son . Coolant system shutdown . Core meltdown will occur in t-minus ten minutes . Can you override it ? I can try . Then do it . Get Maya ! They lied to us ! What happened ? The boy he attacked me . She didn 't make it . Rosko is dead . Dimi can no longer lead us . What are we supposed to do ? We have to leave . Avi , get to the bridge . Get us ready . But we don 't leave with out the Niner . What Niner ? Maya ! Coolant system shtudown Maya ! Core meltdown will occur in t-minus 10 minutes . Jonah ? Hey ! Override failure . Coolant leak beyond containment . Core meltdown will occur in t-minus three minutes . Jonah , override 's impossible . We have to move now . Roger . Coolant leak beyond containment . We need to go or we 're not going to clear in time . Stand by . Just stand by . There 's no more pods . There 's another way off . Jonah ! Meltdown imminent . Come on ! MOVE ! Meltdown imminent . We 're outta time ! Go ! Get us out of here . You OK ? I got you . You 're safe now . Here to finish me off , brother ? You 'll be doing me a favour . But it 's not who you really are , is it ? You are a sympathiser . So what are you going to do next sympathiser ? Where are you going to lead them ? No place is safe . The Greyskins are coming and you know it . I want you to tell me everything you know about the war that 's coming .

 A year ago , the animals started acting strangely , but no one noticed ... until they began attacking , coordinating , evolving . The animals were mutating , and it was happening faster than anyone expected . The government came up with a plan . Thanks to the Noah Objective , in six to ten years the world 's animal population will be thriving once again . Killing the animals ? Play God and repopulate the planet ? This is ridiculous . But messing with Mother Nature could be catastrophic . So a group of us are trying to save the animals . Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta , animal experts . Chloe Tousignant , an intel operative . Jamie Campbell , a reporter who 's been following this story , found me , Mitch Morgan , a veterinary pathologist . We thought all hope was lost when the key to our cure crashed and burned ... but we were wrong . I still have it . I have the leopard , I have the cure . Now we just have to get to Jamie and the leopard , but time is running out . What 's the plan ? There 's a boat that will take us to Jamie . A boat ? It 'll take 18 hours or so , but , you know , air travel . Yeah , I 'm okay not getting on a plane for a while . Hey . What is that ? You all right ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , it 's nothing . It 's a dog bite , it 's fine . That needs to be cleaned up . It doesn 't look too good . Will do . What the hell ? This doesn 't look so good , either . Any ideas ? I 'm open to suggestions . Yeah , man , get us out of here . Hold on . Turn here ! We need to get to Jamie . And the cure . We got to keep moving . If the harbor 's anything like this , the captain won 't wait long . Neither will they . Abe . Count to five , light me . What are you doing ? I 'm making a wall . Meet me at Amelia 's office , she 'll get us another car . Are you out of your mind ? Probably . Oh , boy . - Let 's go . - No ! - We can 't just leave him . - He said he 'll meet us at Amelia 's office and he will . - No . - He 's an African safari guide , I like his chances way better than ours . Run , Chloe . Guys . Go , go , go ! Help . Help ! Save my baby . Please help . Take her . I got her . New arrivals without family members ... Hey . Hey , uh , we 're-we 're here to see Amelia Sage . And we 're looking for Chloe Tousignant and Jackson Oz . Have they checked in yet ? Couldn 't tell you , pal , we 're a little busy . I can 't see them anywhere . The National Guard struggles to regain control of the city from the escaped zoo animals . The death toll continues to rise with 362 known fatalities and thousands injured in what many are calling the Day of the Beast . Chloe ! Hey . Where 's Jackson ? We hoped he was here . Why do you have a baby ? It happened after the hornets . A mother , she ... sh-she , she didn 't survive . - That 's terrible . - Yeah . This day 's chock-full of terrible . Hopefully Amelia can salvage it . Find us a way out of town . She hasn 't - checked in yet . - Jackson ! Hey . What happened to you ? You okay ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Rafiki , what happened out there ? Brakes failed . I had to jump but fire did the trick . Scared all the animals away ? Yeah , didn 't see any after the explosion . Got lucky , I guess . My friends are coming to get us . You have a very important job to do . You know , they are going to write books about you , the man who saved the leopard who saved the world . I 'm going to make sure that they 're translated . Nawok . Nawok ? That 's ... uh , rope ? Hey . What is it ? Hey , there , little , uh ... little gremlin guy . How 'd you get in here ? You 've lost a lot of blood . Well , then why are you taking more ? - Typing and crossing . - All right . You may need a transfusion . - I 'm fine . - Hey , she 's just trying to help . I will save you the trouble . O-negative , I 'm a universal donor . Still got to check , handsome . You got banged up pretty good . May have internal bleeding . And what about his bite ? Keep it clean . Watch for infection , and if you 're wondering , just like everyone else , the animals can 't pass the virus on to humans . It 's not a virus . Whatever it is , it 's not contagious . You could have been killed . I wasn 't , okay ? And I 'm not waiting around for some ridiculous blood results . I 'm fine . You 're not fine . None of this is fine . Chloe , I 'm okay . Everything 's okay . Tell that to the mother of this child or anyone else who died today . The sooner we get out of here , the sooner that we can get to the leopard and find the cure , and everything will be okay . Yes , and what if it isn 't ? The mutation has spread to insects . They were the dispersal method . Yeah , well , that 's still our best chance . It 's time for a solution we know will work . There are over 42 million species of animal . Wreaking havoc on the world . So , you 're in favor of the Noah Objective now , huh ? You want to call all the animals , exterminate them , and then repopulate . - If it means saving lives . - It is straight up murder . And what do you call what happened to this child 's mother ? - I call it terrible . - Huh ? It 's terrible . After everything we 've been through , wasn 't there a moment when you felt that putting a bullet in them was the right thing ? Hey , Danny and Sandy . We finally got somebody from Amelia 's office to talk to us . Guys , this is Eleanor Lewis . She 's with IADG . Okay . Where 's Amelia ? Her motorcade was attacked . There were no survivors . It 's not just here . The animals have attacked Berlin , Moscow , Paris , Hong Kong ... Not to make bad news worse , but the mutation has jumped to the insects . The mosquitoes might not be able to distribute the cure . - It 's worse than that . - What do you mean ? There are five species known to be essential to human survival , bees , bats , butterflies , primates and plankton . We 've already lost bats and primates . Without the insects , the only thing we have left on our side is the oh-so-useful plankton we 're losing . Our only shot is the leopards . Can you get us another car so we can make it to the boat ? Okay , that won 't be necessary . I 'm sending choppers and a team to New Brunswick to get Ms. Campbell and the cure . I want to see . This is a military operation , Dr. Morgan . No , you need a vet on board . The cure 's in a leopard . Leopards have a very high sensitivity to sound . A chopper 's kind of loud . So if that animal is not sedated properly ... I 'm talking .2 milligrams of diazepam too much or too little ... then your cure is gonna wake up and chew somebody 's face off or they 're gonna ... Oh , go no further . I get it . Why do I get the sense your passion goes past the leopard ? By the way , I 'm on that chopper , too . If he goes , I go . Well , I suppose you want on as well ? I want to get this child to its father . I think I can help with that . You pulled her from an urban transport . I think I can call the station to find out where the mother and infant were picked up . Thank you . Bring Jamie home safe . President just declared a state of emergency . He 's starting mandatory evacuations all across New England . Mandatory evacuations ? But where will everybody go ? Apparently the government 's setting up safe zones ... Albany , Dover , Portland . Chopper 's on its way . Did you install those titanium clamps I asked for to secure the crate ? Yes , sir . So you 're the ones who figured out why the animals went crazy . That would be us . Didn 't think you guys really existed . Thought you were some urban myth . So what happens when we get this leopard ? We use its DNA to make a cure , fix the animals . Just like that ... wow . It 's an honor to serve alongside you . Oh , the honor is all ours . Well , we 're still one leopard short of a cure , so let 's keep the champagne on ice , okay ? Copy that . We 'll have you in the air in two minutes . Wait here . After everything we 've been through , we 're finally going to do this . We 're going to get a cure . And Jamie . It 's going to be okay . It 's okay . Just ... just stay here . They 're coming for you . You 'll be safe here . 15 minutes out from the coordinates you gave us . Copy . Command Five on the drop right now . Hey , come and get me ! On your approach , look lively down there . Tranqs ready . No live rounds . We 're coming in . Brace yourselves . Jamie ! Jamie ! They found a body , male . No sign of the leopard . The leopard . What ? You got him ? We have eyes on the target . Any sign of the girl ? Negative ! Jamie did this . Yes , Mitch . She was here . She was right here . Jamie ! Jamie ! - Let 's go ! - No , no , there 's a woman here . - We 've got to go . - There 's a woman here . Let 's roll . Everyone fall in line . Jamie ! We have to go . - We have to go . - I am not leaving her here . She left that rope . That means she 's still alive , okay ? She left the rope so we could find the leopard , and we did . - We can 't leave her here , okay ? - We can come back - and find Jamie . - No , no , no . No . I 'm not ... I 'm not leaving . I 'm not leaving . What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm not leaving without you . - I 'm not leaving . Get your hands off me . I 'm taking you back home to ... Come on . Fall in ! Fall in ! We 've got to go ! Come on ! We can still find her , come on . We did it to save your life . We can come back for Jamie . Hey , keep your head . Keep your head . I hate you for this . She 's right over here . Oh , my God , Bella ... Bella . Hi . You 're okay . Your wife was very brave . She saved your daughter 's life . Oh ... Thank you . Excuse me . You ran Jackson Oz 's blood earlier for internal bleeding . Oz . Oh ... here it is . Can I have his results ? I 'm his wife . You sure this is right ? Yes , ma 'am . Ran it myself . Hello . Okay , I 'll be right there . Where 's Jamie ? Ask him . There was nothing you could do for her ? - We were surrounded . - Didn 't look for her ? It was not viable . Can you send a team back up there - to look for her , immediately ? - Yes . I 'm on it . I need to talk to Eleanor . Look , I have to tell you something . I got a copy of your blood tests . What did they find ? Nothing . You 're perfectly healthy . Okay . Except your blood ... You said you were a universal donor , right ? Yeah , I am . Not anymore . Uh ... maybe they got it wrong . Right ? Universal donor , universal recipient ... I got your medical records . You were born O-negative . But it changed . Recently . The mutation isn 't contagious , all right ? It can 't spread to humans . We know that . Maybe we don 't know as much as we thought . It 's been ten minutes since we administered the cure . It took a while for the cure to work in Zambia , too . Not this long . It 's not working . It works . You 're doing it wrong . You ! You did something wrong . Dr. Morgan , we followed your protocols to the last detail . Dog seems to disagree . Did you verify the viability of these stem cells ? Measured 89 % with 7-AAD dye exclusion . - Cross-check for contamination ? - Zero ppm detected . Resuspend at the right temperature . Obviously . Well , obviously not . Something 's wrong . You don 't have clearance ... Clearance ? We didn 't fly around the world for that leopard so that you textbook hacks could screw it up . Hey , what 's he gonna do , Doc , huh ? Make it not work more ? It 's okay . Easy . Easy , easy . Good boy . Just drop . Come on , just drop . Just drop ! This baseline heart rate is way higher than anything we 've seen before . It 's like ... it 's like the dog 's still mutating . We 're too late . Everything that we 've done , all for nothing . Total waste ! Wait ... Get your hands off me , Kenyatta . All right ? Don 't touch me , don 't even think about me , all right ? We can find another way ! We will not find another way ! We will not find another way . This ... is over . I 'm done . Believe me , I 'm just as disappointed as you are . Whatever was in the leopard when it cured the dog in Zambia is gone . - We 're starting from scratch . - It 's still there . Okay ? The-the leopard , the cure , was isolated for three months , showed no signs of contamination . The cure didn 't change . Then why didn 't it work ? I stayed down there with the dog , looked through everything , the cure did not change . I believe the animals did . The mutation in the animals has moved past the Mother Cell . I 'm afraid that we were too late . I think that the mutation is still mutating . Assuming you 're right , what is it you 're asking for ? More time . Okay , time is something we have fairly little of . Amelia and I are ... were some of the last IADG members looking for a non-lethal solution to the animal problem . After today 's attacks , the Noah Objective seems unstoppable . Well , we found a solution once , we can do it again . Eleanor ... We will do everything we can to get ahead of this thing . All right ? That dog ... probably all the animals out there ... are still changing . Everything that we have seen so far could just be the beginning . I 've heard this before . What do you mean ? Dr. Mark Vickers . Another scientist I 'm working with . How did he put it ? " The initial mutation is just the preamble . The main event is coming . " We need to talk to him . He 's on a research mission in Argentina with a team of Army Rangers , searching for an animal with what he calls a " phase two mutation . " Then Argentina is our next stop . - Abby ? - No . - Sarah ? - No . Michelle ? Mary ? Miranda ? Nope , nope , no . You want to take a guess , there , Dr. Vickers ? What are we guessing ? Ward 's wife is nine months pregnant . It 's a girl , but he won 't tell us the name . Well , it 's your guess . I 've been friends with Ward since Basic . - I don 't need a guess , I know . - Oh , so he told you . I didn 't tell her zip . She just thinks she knows . - Oh , I know ! - What 's the name , then ? My boy here 's obsessed with all things Harry Potter , so I 'm gonna go with Hermione ! Is she right , Ward ? Like I said , I didn 't tell her zip . Hermione . Damn old lady name . I know what I know . Clear the area . - Check the river . - On it . The animal we 're tracking did this ? It would appear that way , but just to be sure ... Get that side . Eyes out . Clear . Yes . An animal with a phase two mutation inflicted these wounds . We 're switching to live ammo . Whatever did this isn 't going down with tranqs . What ? No , no , no , no , no , no . Absolutely not . This-this creature is the key . It 's the pivotal link in the next phase of the mutation . It must be captured alive . The tranquilizers will take it down . You have orders . Yeah , to keep you alive . No , to help me capture this creature . Or do I need to call Washington ? Stay with tranqs . Keep your sidearms close . Staying with tranqs . Roger that , staying with tranqs . Let 's move out . We pushed our luck already with the trip to New Brunswick . The friendly skies haven 't been so friendly to us . Hey , don 't worry . Apparently , according to Eleanor , this plane has been equipped with some sort of countermeasures . So , they 're going to try and squeeze us into a fighter jet . Looks like the skies just got a whole lot friendlier . This is your pilot , Greg Trotter . Greg , this is Jackson Oz ... - Hey . - Welcome . - Abraham Kenyatta ... - Hi , how are you ? - And Chloe Tousignant . - Hi . Well , nice meeting y 'all . I 'm off to do preflight . Be in the air in no time . Enjoy your tour . The sleeping quarters and the lounge are upstairs . You 'll have to decide amongst yourselves who gets the master bedroom . This kitchen is bigger than my first apartment . Vehicle bay is in the tail and this is the lab . Eleanor ... whose plane is this ? An interested third party who has a lot to lose if the Noah Objective goes forward . And this third party is giving us a ride to meet a scientist ? Not giving you a ride , giving you a plane . What 's the catch ? No catch . Hey . That was the first question I asked , too . I also asked for a basketball hoop right up there . Guess we haven 't gotten around to that one yet , huh ? So , you 're back ? I thought you quit . Well , to be honest , I got no place else to go ... and I made a deal with our new pal , Eleanor , here . She 's gonna send a team to look for Jamie , and if they can 't find her , she 's gonna send another and another and another until we do find her . Right , Eleanor ? As soon as a team becomes available , I 'll dispatch them to New Brunswick . Eleanor , thank you , truly . It 's the least I can do . And thank you for using your leverage . All right , if I won all of you in a raffle , I 'd probably give you back to the guy who won second place . Although he probably wouldn 't want you , either . Nor would he want me , because I 've been behaving like a five-year-old . As to why we 're all being raffled off in the first place , I can 't really ... Look , I 'm ... What I 'm trying to say is we don 't get to choose our families . For better , for worse , we 're pretty much family now . Right ? We 've got work to do , so let 's do it . And what is that work , Eleanor ? Do we have an official assignment ? Stop the mutation . Oh . That 's all . Thanks to aggressive lobbying by Reiden Global , the IADG is set to vote on the Noah Objective in six weeks . If it 's approved , there will be no turning back . Hang on a second . Reiden Global ? The biotech company that started this whole animal mess ... they still have a say in this ? They offered a solution , and people are listening . The Noah Objective is not a solution . - It 's murder . - We 're part of a dwindling few who believe that . The only way we 're gonna convince the others is by giving them a viable alternative . Start in Argentina . Meet with Dr. Vickers , see if his work ... if this animal he 's hunting can help you . We don 't have much time . It 's clear . We 're good to go . Okay , we 'll bunk here tonight . Oh , wait . Look , we 're so close . Trail 's washed away . Tracker 's on the fritz . We 'll leave at 0500 . Ward , you got first watch . We now have confirmation from the IADG that the rumored cure has failed . And in light of the attacks in Washington D.C. , suburbs all along the Eastern Seaboard are being evacuated . Residents are encouraged to take shelter in the nearest protected city or government safe zone . I have the feeling things are going to get worse before they get better . I need a drink . We got to the safe zone a few hours ago . But there 's a long line for the computers . And the food . And showers . There 's so many people here . And they all seem ... angry . Yeah , well , people are scared , Clem . And they 're frustrated . I 'm just glad you 're safe ... you and your mom . And ... Justin . How you feeling ? I 'm fine . They took Henry . Who did ? The people here ... in charge . They put him in the quarantine with the other pets . Well , I 'm sure they 'll take good care of him , okay ? Don 't worry . Do you think they 'll let me visit him ? I don 't think that 's a good idea , kiddo . Henry 's going to be fine . Okay ? Dad ... when 's this going to be over ? Soon . How do you know ? I know because I 'm the one who 's gonna make it over . Here , check ... check this out . Look at this . Oh . See all that ? Would you believe me if I told you I 'm on an airplane right now ? Whoa . - No way . - Way . And I 've got everything I need here to , uh ... to fix the animals . So you don 't have to worry about anything except for staying safe and staying healthy , okay ? Okay . I love you . I love you , too . I pulled a few strings ... slightly illegal strings ... and I changed your medical records . Well , then , uh ... we got nothing to worry about , huh ? We don 't have to worry about anyone else finding out . We 'll keep this between the two of us . Our little secret . Our little secret that what ? My blood 's changing ? That I 'm changing ? Changing into what ? Yes , that is our current position . Well , I look forward to their arrival . Thank you , Ms. Lewis . A team is en route to join us . Whoa , whoa , whoa . That mean our tour 's extended . Above your pay grade , Ward . I need to be home when Hermione is born . Hermione ? She was right . I know what I know . Whatever . I need to be there . Yeah , I understand . Completely . But if you want what is best for your daughter , for your sons , your wives , we need to stay here . If we don 't succeed here , you don 't have families to go back to . Everything will be gone . Life as we know it will change . I am talking about the extinction of the human race . But we can stop it . Our work here will make it so our children have a future . They will be able to ... ride bikes and play baseball , hold our hands when we cross the street . Look , we may not be home , but I assure you , we are on the front lines of their future . How many ? Six Rangers and Vickers . Where was their last checkpoint ? A hostel ten kilometers north . Okay . Follow us . No , follow us . Romi , Augie , flank ' em . Look out ! They 're fast . Stay back ! Keep your distance ! Hey , there ! This thing between you and Abe , you got to put it behind you . You 're the team ? We 're here to help . Little late .

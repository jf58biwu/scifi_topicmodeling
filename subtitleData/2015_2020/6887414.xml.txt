 And so we ran on ... Into Summerland and the place they said did not exist . All the while , wolves were at our heels . Black masks , boots , and the one they called " The Eye . " We had come to do the work that must be done ... to strip ourselves of the fog of life before . The human race is beginning to ... evolve . David ! We believe ... myself and the people here ... that you are a very powerful telepath . David ! Telekinetic , potentially . Which means you can control matter with your mind . The Divisions were created by our government to track and study people like you and Syd . And the ones they can 't control , they kill . Are you hearing voices now ? - Hey , hey , hey ... - They 're louder here . So much power , it 's making you sick . I want you to focus on the voices . No . No . That 's ... that 's worse . Trust me . You 're safe here . Now , close your eyes . Focus . There 's a single voice calling your name . Can you hear it ? - David ? - What are you doing ? Can you find it ? David ? Do it ! - David ! - Stupid ! - You are stupid ! - David ? Worthless ! - David ? - Do it . Do it ! All right , I want you to concentrate on it . David . Now dial out all the other voices . Imagine there 's a big knob , the volume knob , - and just turn it down ... - David . Until all you hear is that one voice . David ? David . That 's good , David . Very good . That 's what we call telepathy . Get some sleep . Tomorrow memory work begins . Hi . Hey . You feeling better ? Um ... what does she mean " memory work " ? David , your whole life , people have told you you were sick . What if I told you that 's a lie ? What if I told you every memory you have of mental illness ... the voices , hallucination ... was just your power ? And what if I could do more than just tell you ? What if I could show you ... Help you rewrite the story of your life ? Do ... do we have time for that ? - Didn 't you say Division Three ... - We 'll make time . You 're very important to us , David ... to me . I need you clear . I need you focused . This is how we do it ... We look back , we find your powers , we see what triggers them . But what matters most ... we make you whole . Amy . Wait up , Amy ! Come on , King ! Come on ! You can see why I said you need to see this for yourself . We call this " memory work . " Amy . Your sister . What was I , like , eight ? How is it ... Are we , like ... Are we inside my head ? Ptonomy is what we call our memory artist . That 's his gift . - Can I talk with her ? - I mean , you can . But it 's better if you don 't . It changes the memory . Just take it in for now . This first time is about accepting that it 's real , and then we can focus on work ... taking you back to those moments in your past when you first felt your so-called illness coming on . I 'll show you that it was really just your gift . We 're gonna make you whole again . Come on , Davy . Mom said home by 6 : 00 . Okay . Come on , King . Can I ... Can we ... Can we follow them ? Pretend we 're in a museum ... the museum of you . It 's your place . You 're the boss . Where do you want to go ? What do you want to see ? Feel it all again . You 're back in your body , in the moment . No , no , no . Not like this . In rows . - See ? - Okay . All right . There we are . And then take a deep breath . Now try to see it from the outside . Find some distance . Okay . Stand still . Yeah . - Hey , no cheating . - I 'm not . - You 're right here . - That 's your mother ? Not there . - Well , I 've grown a lot . - Yeah . We live in the country . Upstate , there 's no ... light pollution . My dad ... is an ... astronomer . He , was . He ... He ... he died ... last year . " ' To bed , to bed , ' the mother said . " And they wouldn 't let me ... " ' To bed ' , she said . The angry boy ... " - I was still in the hospital . - " His face turned red . " " His face turned red ... " Why can 't I see his face ? You can . This is your memory . All you have to do is look up . " His face turned red , and with a cry , he chopped her head . " " ' No bed ' , he said , " and snicker snack , his mom was dead , dead , dead . " No ! No . I can 't . No . - Hey . - I can 't ... No . Hey , no . It 's okay . It 's not real . They 're just memories . I felt the same way the first time . Yeah ? Okay . Slow down . You see these things , you 're back there , all these feelings ... I did it , too . - How do I get out of here ? - David , it 's all right . No . How do I get ... I just want to ... Sleep . And we both know who that angry boy was . - We do ? - David . Me ? Very good . That 's , um ... I 'm not sure that 's ... Quiet ! I 'm talking . Sorry . - You seem twitchy today . - No . This ... This is me normal . Everything okay at home ? Your girlfriend ? She 's ... We don 't ... I don 't want to talk about it , okay ? God ! I 'm not an easy guy to ... She left . Philly . No . I ... She wanted to , and ... lightning , you know ? Like ... Do you have any gum or , like , a lozenge or , like , liquid or something ? My mouth ... The break up of a relationship can be very disruptive for someone with your condition , David . Are you sleeping ? At night , you mean ? Yeah . No , I 'm fine . The vapor and , I mean ... pfft . It 's not like ... I mean , maybe ... she 'll come back . I think . It 's kind of our dynamic , you know ? And we talked about how that 's not healthy . High-stress , the push-pull . What did you mean , " the vapor " ? - The what ? - You said " the vapor . " No , I was just repeating something the ... the voices said . I see . Well , as I said , this dynamic ... always fighting and making up ... it 's not good for your condition , David . You need a more settled environment . Okay . Yeah . I will work on that . Hey ! All good in the head now ? What ... what is this ? Thought you might be hungry . I could whip us up some ... whatever ... eggs . The Greek ? So is this , like , my stove , or ... Some girl I finger-banged took a real shine to me . She had , like , all these menus on her fridge , you know ? So I figured that she could probably live without stewing any more ragout or whatever . David . David . David . Hey . It 's cool . Drink this . It 's milk . It helps . First time is always the worst in memory work . Your girlfriend threw up . Syd . She 's in with Melanie doing talk work . That 's the deal ... you do memory work with me , you got to do talk work with Dr. Bird , figure out what it all means . Melanie thinks you 're the key . What ? The key to what ? Winning the war . And other things . Dr. Vacon 's Advanced Time Travel class has been canceled . She called you a " memory artist " ? Melanie . You ... That was all you ? That is weirdly impressive . My pops had a crap memory . Artillery shell in the war . Went deaf in one ear . Then he was never good with facts and , like , dates and stuff . Used to ... snap his fingers at me when he forgot my name ... which is funny , ' cause I remember everything . What do you mean " everything " ? Like , I remember my birth ... before , even , the womb . You know how loud the heartbeat is ? Imagine you could remember being inside your mother 's body , warm and blind , and then just this intense pressure , and suddenly ... Light . Tell me about the book . What book ? " The World 's Angriest Boy in the World . " I ... I-I don 't know . I don 't remember , not really . Your memories seem clear to me . Was that really ... Did your parents really read that at bedtime ? Because that would be ... That 's messed up . I don 't want to talk about it . I don 't either . That 's not my deal . I 'm the memory guy , not the talk guy . Take your time getting up . Like I said , first time 's a bitch . The Earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a god . Hi . Hey . I don 't know how this is helping ... the memory work . Yeah , yeah . I thought that too . When I got here , all I wanted was to get you . What did it matter if my mommy was mean to me or what I saw when I was you . I still don 't really understand it . There was a flash . That 's all I remember . We changed places , and everything in the dayroom was so loud . People yelling . And the lights . Drums in my head . I 've never felt that way before . And ... something else . Something ... That 's when it happened . David , I think ... I ... killed your friend . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . It 's not your fault . Don 't give a newbie a bazooka ... Bazooka and act surprised when she blows shit up . What ? Nothing . I just ... Well , they heard it ... when I used your power . Melanie and the others ... they heard it , and they came . And Division Three came because they heard it too . They thought they found you ... But it was really me . Surprise ? I ... I want to hug you . You can 't . We could ... hold hands . Can I be honest ? It 's really uncomfortable for me . Even with the gloves . There 's this feeling , the closer I get to someone ... It 's like being covered with ants , these little anxious needles under my skin . Sometimes it 's all I can do not to scream . Well , we wouldn 't want that . No . Sorry . Don 't be . We 're having a romance of the mind . I like that . All right , Mr. Haller , try not to sneeze . Why would I sneeze ? Well , for example . Move , basically . It ... It jumbles the scan . Apple . Nixon . Onion . No , " onion . " - Santa . - Are you talking to me ? No , I 'm not . Sorry . Alaska . No , you don 't play like this . Shh ! I talk to myself sometimes , too . Well , not myself . The ... the voices . You 're supposed to ignore them , but sometimes ... Also , don 't talk . Sorry . On the list of things not to do ... talk . Like sneeze ? Do you have to sneeze ? No . Just ... For the record , I wasn 't talking to myself . I was talking to Kerry . Wait , I thought ... I thought your name was Cary . - Yes , it is . - So you 're talking to Cary , just not the Cary - that happens to be yourself ? - Correct . You have an extremely large amygdala . Thank you . Okay . Deep breath . Try to think of something or ... or ... someone you ... Love . Is he okay ? He gets back into town on Thursday . I think he 's gonna propose . David . That 's ... Good job . " Good job " ? No , I ... that 's great . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm happy for you . You 're sweet , but ... I mean , I don 't know for sure . Men , right ? But who knows ? Maybe ... you and Philly ... Yeah ... I know she 's nice , though ... you know ? I think she ... she gets you . No , that 's ... that 's ... that 's dumb . - I 'm ... That 's not gonna ... - Well ... Why can 't you have what ... what everyone else has ... a nice home , a family ? Because I 'm sick . The point of a stove being what ? Like its function ? To me . I look like a guy who needs a stove ? You know how in baseball they say ... " So-and-so 's a utility player . " The stove is the utility player of the modern home . You know , you can cook with it ... You can heat a room with it . You can read by it . Some of your finer poets even knocked themselves off ... With the old head-in-the-oven scenario . You saying I should kill myself ? Dude . Look , I don 't , um , care what you do with it . I 'm just trying to trade a kitchen range for some drugs . That 's all . We could go by weight or ... Kid . Mazel tov . Why is it blue ? It 's always blue . Well , yeah . Hey , we should , um ... you know that doctor that you see ? Does he have any good ... You 've been to his place , right ? Is it , like , fancy ? - Who ? Dr. Poole ? - Yeah . His , um ... I 'm asking 'cause I was thinking maybe , like , one night , you know ... When he 's not there , we could , like , slip in and ... 'Cause that could be ... I 'm asking . It 's got great score potential , you know ? And I 'm saying , like , action movie , " one last job and I 'm out " type of thing , you know ? - Lenny . - What ? Red leather , yellow leather . Red leather , yellow leather . Red leather , yellow leather . Freeze . What just happened ? Nothing . Your reaction to Lenny just then ... what were you seeing ? When you looked at her , what did you see ? Nothing . I ... We were high , okay ? I-I see things , okay ? It 's not real . It 's my brain . That 's the old narrative , son ... the schizophrenic delusions . You 're not schizophrenic . You have powers . The things you see are real . Like I showed you with the voices . Which reminds me , I 'd like to go back to something else . Quiet . I 'm talking . Sorry . You seem twitchy today . Nope . Nope . This is me normal . Everything okay at home ? Your girlfriend ? We don 't ... I 'm not an easy guy to ... - She left . - Pfff ... Philly . No . I ... She wanted to , and ... lightning , you know ? Freeze . What happened there ? I-I don 't know . Maybe my ... You saw it ? There was a glitch , a time jump . Yes . David , it 's very important that you remember everything . I am . I do . I will . I just ... Maybe I was distracted ? No . Even if you were focused on something else , the surrounding memory should be intact . It 's okay to be confused . We 'll find the truth together . Take us back . She left . Philly . No . I ... She wanted to , and then ... something happened , and ... Lightning , you know ? Do ... do you have any gum , or , like , a ... Wait . There was a flash . Did you see that ? You were in a kitchen maybe ... six years ago . You were using your powers ? I don 't know . I didn 't see anything like that . Concentrate ! Try and focus on where you went just now . An apartment . There was some kind of an incident . - I 'm sorry . - It 's okay . Just make your mind blank , and I 'll get us there . What happened ? I don 't know . I couldn 't ... He 's too strong . It 's not me . I-I didn 't ... - David , you have to trust us . - I do . I told you . David ... David . David . David . David ! - What ? - I said , " How are you ? " Um ... I 'm fine . It 's ... you know ... - It 's a lot to take in . - I know . I was worried . Yeah . What was it ... in the memory ? Melanie won 't tell me . It was just kid stuff . It 's okay , though , that I brought you here ? Yeah , of cour ... Are you kidding ? Look at this place . It 's beautiful . You think we 're safe here ? Right now . But I know they 're looking for us ... to experiment on or ... But I 'll protect you . What ? No , you said ... I thought you ... Never mind . - No , what ? - No , nothing . I ju ... Did you just think ... In your head , did you think , " I 'll protect you " ? - No . I don 't know . - Sorry . I 'm ... I 'm not listening . I just ... I can 't ... control it yet . Well , learn , ' cause not everything is ... No . I know . Just ... You are cute , though . David . You 're moving again . I told you not to . I 'm sorry . It 's just ... How much longer ? A couple of ... Let 's ... We 're just trying to figure out where all your memories are stored . Trying to map the network . Now ... think about what happened next . And this sense you have , of seeing another world out of the corner of your eye , when did that start ? Maybe ... 10 or 11 . One last job , and we 're out . It 's kind of hard to , um ... you know . It 's like trying to make a list ... - people yelling in your ear . - Big score potential . The ... the pills I prescribed should help with that . They ... do . Some . It 's always blue . You 're not supplementing , are you ? What do you mean ? Last time , you used the word " vapor . " I looked it up . There 's a new drug ... No . I don 't . The pills ... the prescription . I 'm clean . 10 or 11 . You said the visions started . What do you remember most about those years ? Well ... Andromeda ... Cassiopeia ... Bootes , Canis Major , Lupus ... Telescopium . In the sky . My dad was ... My father was a ... He ... studied the ... the stars . - An astronomer . - Yes . And he used to ... wake me up in the ... the middle of the ... and ... we 'd drive out in his truck to , the ... And I 'd ... I 'd look up at the lights in the sky , and ... They 'd talk to me . - The stars ? - Which was ... And I thought they talked to everybody . And I told my dad , and he said ... at first he said , " They talk to me , too , " but he meant it like a ... metaphor . And what did the stars say ? No , that 's ... I 'm not ... I 'm not ... I 'm not supposed to talk about it . This is a safe place , David . Nothing can hurt you here . No , I 'm ... I 'm fine . Just , um ... Wait . We should ... Let 's talk about something else , okay ? What did you say that article was about ? A new , drug or something ? It 's just a closet , David . Nothing to worry about . You see ? Nothing to worry about . So ... Why don 't you tell me what the stars said ? David . What ? I didn 't say anything . No , it was ... It sounded like a woman . I didn 't ... did you say something ? No . She says she didn 't say anything . - Who ? - Kerry . I thought your name was ... Look , can we ... Are ... Are we done ? ' Cause I-I got to ... We 're almost done , all right ? David , where are you ? Amy ? David . - I told you . David . - You are stupid . As I said on the phone , we 've never had a David Haller at this facility . Well , that 's just crazy . We don 't use that word here . I don 't know what other word to use . Mrs. Haller , if your brother was here ... He was . Then there would be a record . Look , I don 't know anything about your records . I 've been to this hospital a hundred times . I 've been visiting him for years . Do you understand ? I-I sat in that room . I met with his doctor . This " Kissinger " you mentioned ... Yes ! Dr. Kissinger . Douglas ... Dennis ... Kissinger . He worked with David for nearly two years , and they were making progress ... real progress . Let me guess . You don 't have any record of him either . Perhaps you have us confused with another facility . Is someone putting you up to this ? Are you being ... coerced ? Ms. Haller , I 'm beginning to wonder if we shouldn 't admit you for observation . - What ? - Tell me , have you ever seen a psychiatrist for paranoid delusions ? Amy ? Amy ! David ? Amy ! Aah ! Amy ! David , what ... what just happened ? - What ? - Your brain just lit up . There 's all kinds of neural activity . I 've never seen anything like this , really . It 's ... That wasn 't a memory . I just ... I just heard my sister . Hey , don 't move . What ? I got ... don 't move . I 'll be right back . Did you ... did you leave ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Shit . Come on ! Okay . I am ... I 'm done with this shit . - Check it out . - Look ! My God ! - Look at this . - Come on . Do you see this ? - Come on ! - Come over here . David Haller . As I said ... They have her . Division Three . They probably do . You can 't help her . I have to go . Elevator going up . Descending . - You 're leaving . - Just for a day or two . Is it me ? Because of me ? We can hold hands . I want to . Syd ... I was in the machine ... the MRI ... and I saw Amy . You saw your sister in the MRI machine ? No , she ... I-I found her . I heard her . She 's looking for me , and I think they found her ... Division Three . She 's in trouble . I don 't ... I can 't just ... It ... it ... it 's jumbled up . There is something wrong with me , I know , but I cannot just leave her . Stay ! Do the work . Not long , just ... enough to learn what you can do , what we can do , together . Then we can rescue her like we rescued you . Do the work . Well , how do I know they won 't kill her ? Because she 's bait . Down . Descending . Shall we begin ? Tell me about your childhood .

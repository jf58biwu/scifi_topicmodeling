 Previously on Cleverman . Gotta get out of here . Go ! - You have to get rid of the Namorrodor . - It 's just stories , Waru . - Like Santa Claus . - More people are gonna die . - Unless you act . - Have you spoken to Koen yet ? What do you want me to do , beg ? Will take a few minutes for the drug to make effect . You are so close to losing everything . We 've worked too hard and too long for you mess it up now . Help us . Call an ambulance . What 's that ? Charlotte Slade . - Hi . - How are we today ? A little bit nervous . I 've been through this quite a few times . We 've managed to harvest and fertilize very impressive embryos . I have full confidence . Oh , this is my husband . Jarrod Slade . - Pleased to meet you . - And you . Come through . Thinking of England . Think boy or girl . All right , Charlotte . I 'm just gonna ask you to relax . Okay , keep steady . Here we go . Oh ! I love you . I love you . I can 't imagine what it must be like to look at this view every day . No , a couple of years , a few more melted polar ice caps , then we 'll be the ones with waterfront . Perhaps we should be selling , Charlotte . Yeah . It 's a lovely meal . Oh , thank you , but Jarrod takes the credit for lunch . - No . - Oh , you can cook , too ? Waruu here can 't boil an egg . I enjoy the alchemy of the kitchen . I 'll be back in just a tick . Need a GPS to find yourself around here . - Is everything okay ? - I 'm pregnant . - Oh ! - Oh , my God . Okay , well , that was about three months premature . I won 't say a thing . Oh , is it something you want ? Oh , God , yeah . I just ... - I didn 't think I could . - Oh . Well , I 'm really happy for you . Congratulations . Oh , God . I hope it sticks . Sorry , I 'm just after the bathroom . Oh , God , I 'm sorry . It 's just down here . Great . Cops should be crawling all over the place . Blair , wait . Blair , we don 't know who 's in there . Blair ! Grab something to hold her . We got to go , brother . I 'm not leaving her here like this . So why are we here ? Charlotte 's filled me in with what you 're trying to do in the Zone . The issues you 're facing with a lack of basic amenities , the ongoing accommodation crisis . I 'd like to help you out . - You offering me money ? - Mmm . I 'm always on the lookout for worthy philanthropic projects . Yours is a good cause . Right in my own backyard , too . Well , not quite your backyard . Come on , you tell me how much you need to kick-start some real improvements in the Zone . 300,000 . From what I understand of the situation , 300 won 't touch the sides . Three million . You 're a man of vision , Waruu . Why don 't we add another zero to that ? Can 't take that much money . 30 million . Now you can leverage off that capital . Turn it into 300 million . Build a citadel . I 'm giving you the chance to have a real stake in your people 's future . Before people like Matthews take that away , too . I would feel comfortable with less . Moses led the Israelites out of the wilderness . He didn 't just drop them off at the bus stop midway . Take the money , Waruu . Let 's stop mucking about . And what do you want in return ? Your brother . I still don 't understand a word you 're saying . Let 's go . If we go into the Zone half-cocked , we will lose personnel . Then do your job properly . You promised me air support , tear gas . For three kids ? Come on . What happened to you ? Subhuman encounter . Send a couple of cars in . I don 't care about collateral damage . I can work with that . But three Hairy boys loose in the streets tearing people 's hearts out ... They didn 't . I did . You killed Dickson ? No , I just made the best of a bad situation . That symbol on the wall , that was you ? Your approval rating went up 10 percentage points after your press release , after that image went viral . Now , did I do the wrong thing ? - Hey ! - Hey , dickheads . Look here . Get me those boys . Come on , come on . Welcome to the Zone . - The savage . Stop ! Show us your hands . - Stop ! Wait ! Don 't shoot . That 's assaulting an officer . Stay down . Get down . Get off ! Get off me ! Don 't touch a CA officer , you rug bastard . Okay , Max , I 'm gonna need you to keep your eyes open . Okay ? Can you try ? It 's gonna hurt . Okay , let me just get the milk in there . Okay ? Oh , I know it hurts . I know it hurts . Just try and keep them open . What happened ? We were just fooling around and the guards pulled out their guns . Then they went Uncle Max . Kicked him on the ground and stuff . You all right , Uncle ? I 've got to go , brother . Come on , we can 't stick around here . Let me drop you somewhere . Getting rid of me ? It 's not safe for you where I got to go . Dump and run time ? I 've got shit to deal with , Blair . And it doesn 't involve you . - It 's a bit late for that . - Blair . - Blair . - You knew what was gonna happen to Ash , didn 't you ? That 's why you had the gun . You knew and you didn 't tell me . Did he know ? See ? Kora knows you 're an ass . - Don 't you , Kora ? - Ass . I remember when I first met him . I was 13 sleeping rough under a bridge . But it was better than sleeping at home with a randy old man . It was cold . Freeze a witch 's tit off cold . And this guy comes up asking for somewhere to sleep . - But he didn 't have anything . - I just split the Zone . He was full of the same old Koen shit . Telling stories , making us laugh . You 're a funny bastard when you want something , aren 't you , Koen ? Then he wanted my sleeping bag . Later he wanted my girlfriend . - I knew . - No . No . Come on , brother , you got that wrong . That 's not what she 's saying . Kora , do you concur ? Kora concurs . So that 's three against one says you lie . We need to go . I 'm not going anywhere until you say you screwed Ash . - We 're not open ! - Say it . - Okay , whatever . - Not good enough . Say " I screwed Ash . " I screwed Ash . How many times ? Lose count ? It didn 't mean anything . So you screwed my girlfriend and it didn 't mean anything ? Is that what you 're saying ? Ass . Cleverman . Blair . Didn 't you hear me ? I 'm at work . Okay , he has to call me back . No , no , listen to me . He has to because I can 't ' cause my phone 's almost out of credit . Jesus , Jordan ! Okay , that 's both hands . You 're good to go . Hairies out , Hairies out ... - They 're a bunch of savages . - You dirty animal ! IDs , please . - Hey ! - You filthy rug ! Hey , which one of you used capsicum spray on an unarmed man ? - Ma 'am , you need to calm down . - Was it you ? No , I 'm not gonna calm down . I want your name and I want your rank - and I want them right now . - Ma 'am you need to back off . - I 'm not gonna back off . - Excuse me , sir . We have a slight situation on our hands . I 'm not gonna back off . No one is to touch a hair on her head . - Do you understand me ? - Uh , yeah . Firing on innocent children . Macing old men . You people are a disgrace . The Zoners , they 're no different from you . They 're just trying to raise their families as best as they can . And now you stop food trucks from getting in . There 's children in there . Whatever happened to live and let live ? Get a real job . - Whatever happened ... - Stop helping savvies . You 're the ones that are subhuman ! - Hey , hey , monkey ! - You 're the ones that are subhuman . You 're the ones that are subhuman . Get back inside , you Hairy lover . Welcome to the Zone . Just push it . Well , here 's trouble . Hey , I 'm Blair . This is Ash . We 're operating under the idea that her name is Kora . But we 've got no idea . _ You understand her ? Where 'd you say you know her from ? - We sort of picked her up . - Picked her up where ? _ _ Ass . Suck it up . No . That 's not good . She 's not from here . This is old spiritual stuff here . She 's like some kind of ancestral spirit . You didn 't screw her , did you , boy ? He screws anything that moves . Where 's my phone , you Hairy bitch ? You 're gonna regret this . Get up . Get up ! If I find out that you are lying to me ... you 're lying to me about this ... What 's the problem ? She 's got my phone . I had it on me when I was doing her nails . She must have hidden it someplace . I 'll ask you once . Do you have her phone ? - You 're lying . - Shut up , Rowena . If I find out you 're lying to me about the phone ... Who would I call ? You 're off your face . How many times do we have to have this conversation , Rowena ? No doing drugs in Frankie 's house . Here . _ _ You got to send her back , Koen . - Back ? - To her home , her dimension . Yeah , go on , Cleverman . Send her home . Use your fancy stick . Do your magic thing . You want another drink , buru ? Hey , don 't be a smart-ass . You need to take her to the old fig tree , where Jimmy used to take you and Waruu . All I know is she got to get home and you 're the one make it happen . I don 't know shit . Pretty accurate . Clean functioning housing for everyone in the Zone . It 's everything we 've ever dreamed of . More . It 's big money you 're talking about . How much is Slade offering ? Enough to get a business plan together , to redevelop , to approach the bank for a loan . How much ? $ 30 million . And , what , Jarrod Slade 's just gonna hand over the money just like that ? It 's already in our bank account . What ? When a white man gives a black man that kind of money , he wants something back . What does he get ? - He 's a philanthropist . - What does he get ? I 'm trying to create a viable future here for our people - and you 're asking me questions ? - It 's a simple question . - What does he get ? - What options do we have ? Hey . What are you doing up ? You all right ? You want something to eat ? No , I 'm good . I 'm here to speak with my son . Who won 't even look at me . What do you want ? Some bad shit 's been going down . Jimmy ... he 's messed things up . What are you on about ? Koen . He needs your help . Koen 's here ? In the Zone ? Right next door . Says he found her in some sort of laboratory tied to a bed with tubes sticking out of her . Mean anything to you ? - No . - Jimmy , did he mention ? Jimmy stopped making any sense a long time ago . How did you find this place ? She called me . Got inside my head . Calling over and over . What else ? I grabbed her , took her to the bar . Then nothing till ... this guy came around looking for her . He had a gun . He killed my friend . - So I shot him . - Now , that was smart . - There was this other dude . - Shoot him , too ? Different bloke . Tall . Spoke with his head up his ass . Coming offering condolences for Jimmy . Told me he was a friend of his . Offered me a job , too . Straight out of the blue . What 'd you tell him ? Told him to get lost . You seen a guy like that ? Well , Kora needs to be sent back . First things first . We have to get rid of the Namorrodor . That 's your job ... Cleverman . It always comes back to that . Killing it 's the only thing that 's gonna save the Hairies . - We should do it tonight . - Now ? Why not ? Before more people get killed . Your call . And leave her at home . I was thinking ... maybe it 's time you wound up your work in the Zone . At least till after the baby . That 's eight and a half months away . What am I gonna do instead ? - Stay home and crochet ? - There 's a thought . I intend to work until the day I drop . If you were working in an office or a GP practice , maybe . Oh , come on . It 's a dangerous place . It 's not your battle . Someone needs to take a stand . Those CA animals used capsicum spray on an unarmed man today . Exactly , a volatile situation . It 's not just you to consider . Ah , you thinking about your heir ? You are , aren 't you ? Our baby is in rudest of rude health . Okay ? I did an ultrasound today . Its development is off the charts . Must be my good genes . What you gonna be like in eight and a half months , eh ? A monster . So we lure this thing . Say it comes . Then what ? Then you kill it . And it goes back to wherever it came from ? And Kora ? You 'll be in your full powers . You open up the portal , you send her back . That 's not gonna work . You bring the nulla nulla ? It 's in the boot . It 's in the boot . You better go and get it . So , what , I just club it to death ? I guess . Is that all the advice you 're gonna give me ? It 's quick and it goes for the heart . Go , go , go ! Go ! It 's not working . It 's not coming , Waruu . Something 's wrong . - It 's probably your chanting . - You want to do this or not ? 'Cause you don 't look like you do . Looks like you want to run . Stuff you . Go on , then . Take it . Go on , take it . Uncle Jimmy stuffed up . This is your chance to unstuff it . Take the nulla nulla , Waruu . Go on , be the Cleverman . Take it . That 's not how this works . What ? Am I supposed to die first ? That it ? That 's what you 're waiting for , isn 't it , you dog ? I know I die . I 've seen it . What you see and what eventually ... So how does it work , then , brother , huh ? Tell me , do I get mauled to death , and then you take over ? Be the man you 've always wanted to be ? Take it . Yeah , run . That 's what you 're good at , boy . You 're a sellout , Koen . Sell your own mother if you could . Even when we were kids , it 's always been about my mother , eh ? Koen 's a coconut . Koen 's got a white slut mother . Well , I never had a chance to meet her , so I don 't know how you 're such an expert . Huh ? Your mother was a whore . You 're the living proof . Bastard . Oh , do you want to keep going , then , brah ? It 's not over yet , brother . Shh . Shh . Go to sleep . Shh . Hey , little one . How about I make the pain go away ? I know a special way . You interested ? I 'm gonna let you in on a secret . I can fly . When we fly , the pain just goes away . You want to try ? Djukara . Okay , bud . Djukara 's out of fuel now . Mungo . It all go down how you wanted ? What 's happened to you ? I can explain . No need . I saw the tape . You killed that guard with your bare hands . No , no . It wasn 't like that . I saw how it was . Nerida , I swear I had no choice . - You have to believe me . - Believe you ? How can I ? Well , come on , then . Give me your reason . Level with me . Tell me what 's going on . Hmm ? Tell me about this deal you 've got with Slade . Tell me . Must be pretty freaking bad if you can 't tell me . Is it worse than killing a man with your bare hands ? It was him or me . I thought I knew you . I 've no freaking idea who you are . - Look , Nerida . - No , don 't you touch me . Hey . It 's your fault my sister 's dead . You have destroyed everything . Shoot . Go on . Do it . Do it ! What happened out there ? Nothing . Never was going to . I 'm not the one . I 'm just a stuff-up . Don 't say that . I couldn 't save Ash . I couldn 't save Ash . And a kid . Little Hairy girl is dead because of me . I sold her family out to the CA for some extra cash . CA might have pulled the trigger , but it 's my fault that she died . Doesn 't sound so clever to me . She was just a kid . And the last thing that she said to me ... she thanked me . Okay . Come here , love . Come on . Minister . Your man McIntyre needs to be pulled into line . He 's refusing to send down squads into the Zone . The brief has always been one of containment . Situations change , therefore responses must change . You go in there armed and it 'll be carnage . That 's the idea . Assets will be destroyed . The general public won 't like that . Right now we have the Zone population like fish in a barrel . What are you guys up to in there ? Don 't worry . Our interests are not mutually exclusive . I want the Zone cleared . If your company won 't do it , I 'll find one that can . And risk losing the support of my network ? Do we have to keep playing this game ? The public want to feel safe in their homes and on the streets and I 'm gonna make that happen . The Zone will be cleansed . And after it 's empty ... this . Top-floor penthouse I 've set aside . Wonderful , isn 't it ? Sweeping 360 views of the city , the harbor . I reckon you 're gonna be happy living there . I 've been talking to Frankie about purchasing you . Outright . Okay , so you take these twice a day . And some Valium while you 're at it . Okay . Eve . There 's something weird on his skin . Scratches . They 're getting bigger . Hey , are you okay ? Ooh , doesn 't look good . Hold on ... When did this happen ? I don 't know . Shh . Come on , lie back . Alinta , go get Koen now . Eve , you still got them eucalyptus leaves I gave you ? What do I tell him ? Tell him to get here now or I 'll kick his ass into tomorrow . Go on , get him . Do you know what this is ? Yeah . I 'm afraid there 's nothing in your bag of tricks to fix this . It 's not a what , it 's a who . You 've been to a smoking ceremony before , haven 't you ? Yeah . Good . You 're running this one . There 's a young boy in there in a whole lot of pain . Something wrong about it all . Go and get your dad . He should be doing this . Nah , time for you to step up . I 'm not the one . Get Waruu . We don 't always get a chance to do good . If I was you , I 'd grab this opportunity with both hands . I know , right ? Okay , everyone 's got to get out now . Okay , clear out . Go on , get , now . All of you , go on . You , too , darling . It 's not safe for you . You have to go . - Over to you . - I can 't . Whoever 's in there , it 's safe to come out . Follow the smoke . It will set you free . I 'm so sorry . Please forgive me . The smoke will lead you where you need to go .

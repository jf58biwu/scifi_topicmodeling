 Can I count on your support for school trustee ? - I 've been thinking of running against you . - Really ? Professor Ethan Duncan was here . His research . Dyad , I assume . - The Island Of Dr Moreau . - It was a gift from Professor Duncan . This could be his key . Until three weeks ago , we didn 't even know Project Castor existed . We intercepted them as they were forcing her into the trunk of a car . This one killed two members of the security team , the other one got away . - What are they after ? - He says he will only talk to you . Count your sisters . It was the only way to get you out of Dyad . Betray my sister ? For Kira . That 's not your bloody decision ! Hello , brother . There 's an issue . WOMAN GIGGLING And here we are . Whoops ! Sorry . Just hold on a second . There 's , um , adjustments required ... - You got it ? - Almost . Ugh , that is so much better . I thought you were Special Forces . Shouldn 't you have a penthouse ? Cutbacks . Oh . But you are actually a soldier , right ? Cos I once met a guy who said he was a SWAT cop , but then it turned out he sold horse feed for a living . Oh , thank you . SHE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS OK . Can I take your coat ? Sure . You 're a formal dude . Has anyone ever told you that before ? Manners were stressed in my house . Hmm . Really ? And where was that again ? North Korea ? What ? What the hell 's going on ? This is Seth . Listen , guys , this is not what I signed up for ... But we 're brothers . We were taught to share . Well , Delphine 's buggered off to Europe . She 's covering Rachel 's business . She says that Dyad 's off my back , but ... Do you believe her ? I don 't know . No . Hey , what are we doing here ? I need to call Cosima . I get it . Your sisters need you . But I want you to see this . Go ahead . Come on in . Is this your house ? Yep . It is now . Take a look , tell me what you think . I hate surprises . I didn 't think you 'd come if I told you . You can afford this place ? I 'll figure it out . You 're a bloody lumberjack . How are you going to live in the city ? Mom ! Yeah , I , er , bought that for myself , but it shrank in the rain on the way back home . So I was thinking maybe you could use it . Is there anything about this you like ? Yes . Yes . Good . Piss off ! You were talking in your sleep again . What did I say ? General whimpering . Sorrows , regrets . How much you miss me when I 'm gone . Ugh ! Shut up ! KNOCK AT DOOR It 's him . Argh ! Ugh ! - Hey . - At ease , soldier . Major . Glad to see you 're out safe . I met Sarah Manning . Inside ? But not a prisoner . She strolled in like the Queen of Manchester , making demands . Does that seem right to you ? Her and Dyad working together ? I don 't know her like you do , sir . Sit down . You 're first . Some bags are pockets . No pocket is a pouch . Conclusion - all bags are not pouches . False . Some pigs are predators . No predator is a pet . Conclusion - some pigs are not pets . True . Some maggots are flies . No fly is welcome . Conclusion - no maggots are welcome . False . Some doctors are fools . All fools are rich . Conclusion - some doctors are rich . True or false - some doctors are rich . True or false . True . He 's tired . We drank last night . Understood . Your extraction orders . We 're not done here . We don 't have the original sample . Separate pick-ups . Don 't be seen together . You 're travelling this evening . Is that coming from Mother or from you ? You have your orders . Clean up and clear out . You 're going back to base . My God , you must be Scott . Hey . Yes , the bloodwork 's very encouraging , but I want to get you into an MRI . That treatment , though , the one from Kira 's tooth , that 's working , yeah ? I mean , it 's possible that it 's suddenly this efficacious , but ... I know - people have rebounds all the time . I could just as easily dip tomorrow . I know . Cosima - these numbers , they 're great . I just can 't explain them . Maybe it 's about more than numbers . What do you mean ? Are you suggesting a spiritual component ? - A what ? - I 'm not decamping to an Ashram , Felix . - Thank God for that . - I 'm just open to perspectives on ... on the void . Like , before it opens up and swallows me , we have to get back to the lab . I don 't trust Dr Nealon , Cosima . No , of course not . Why would you ? Delphine put him in charge . But I will say one thing , he 's twice the researcher Leekie ever was . He 's an MD , he 's a brilliant geneticist , and he wants a meeting this afternoon . That 's four things . Are you taking this bait ? I just need to know , because I 've got other patients to see . Yeah , yeah . There 's work to be done . OK , take one of these . - And can I get the old one ? - Mm-hm . New day , new phones - blue as the skies of Lesbos . CHILDREN SHOUT I could beat her , Donnie , - I could beat her like a French meringue . - I know . - I 'm not going to let her put our kids in a ghetto . - OK . Easy , it 's just the next district over . Have you seen the playgrounds ? There 's no rubber mulch . It 's gravel , it 's like the ' 70s . Still . We agreed we can 't afford a campaign . At least , not until I get back on my feet . Well , I told her that I 'm running . What ? Ali , we are spread very thin right now ... We might have to sell the house . And what would we do with the corpse in the garage ? Whoa ! Ixnay on that , come on ! Well , what would we do ? Are we going to give it to the next family , or do we take it with us ? OK , I know you 're upset , but come on ... Team Hendrix - " Down but not out . " Am I right ? - Fist me , fist me ! - Fist you ? Dad ! My cleats ! OK ! That 's the saying . Hi . Hello , Mrs Hendrix . Hello , Ramone . What are you doing here ? Are you kidding ? Half my clients are soccer moms . You 're selling pills at a kids ' sports tournament ? Speaking of which . Haven 't , er , haven 't heard from you in a while . Guess you 're still clean . Huh ? Yes . Very much so . - Nice . Congratulations . - Thank you . I 'm actually getting out of the business , myself , so ... You ... you 're closing your business ? Going to college . Yeah . - Say hi to your mother . - I will . Who 's that ? That is an opportunity . POP MUSIC PLAYS HE WHOOPS PHONE RINGS You don 't have to take that , come on ! - I have to take this . - OK . OK . Hey , Art . That 's Detective Bell , to you . Wow , back on the job ? Congrats . Yeah , well , two days in I 'm already questioning it . Listen , a woman came in complaining about an incident - at a hotel last night . - Yeah . And when I saw a photo of the suspects , I immediately took the case . Sarah , they look like that Prolethean freak Mark ... They both do . Do it , do it ! Nice ! Wait , did one of them have a moustache and the other one of them have a scar ? - Now , see , how do you know that ? - Did they hurt the woman ? Well , I just started questioning . But I 'm telling you , - she 's freaked the hell out . - OK . You need to tell me everything you know about these guys . Listen , I 've got to get back inside . - We 're going to continue this conversation . - OK . All right . So , that Castor clone who was in Marion 's basement , he 's gone . He 's ... escaped , or being released . Please , you don 't ... Can you stay ? You don 't have to go . No , I have to . They 've got Helena , I 've got to ... try . They ... Yeah . You 'd really do all this for us ? Don 't freak out , but Kira 's my daughter , too . I 'd do anything for her . Go save your sister . OK ! I 'm back ! THEY GRUNT SHE SHRIEKS Go . SHE GAGS MONITOR BEEPS Now . SHE COUGHS SHE MOANS AND SPLUTTERS Go . SHE GASPS Go again . Stop . Stop . Stop the stress test . We 've got two more cycles to run . She 's pregnant . Bloodwork results . SHE GASPS Just be still . You 're going to feel the water rattle around in there for a while . SHE COUGHS Helena , I 'm Doctor Virginia Coady . I know it doesn 't seem like it ... but I 'm very happy to meet you . And for the invalid , we 've got some hot tea here , with just a little snip of laudanum . I 've got some sugar on the tray , but if you wanted honey , then I ... HE SIGHS You shouldn 't be up . Come on . Sit down . - Oh . - You OK ? Does it hurt ? Come on . Chin up . Sarah will come around . She will . Do you think so ? Really ? I fear I 've lost her , Felix . And my granddaughter ... And I might be able to bear that if I thought I 'd ... made them safe . But ... SHE SCOFFS .. clearly I have not . OK . OK . So do something about it . I 've done quite enough already . No . Nonsense . Hang on . Look what I 've got . What is that ? It 's a clean cell . For contacting your dodgy friends . For scheming and manoeuvring and setting things in motion . I have no use for it . Yes , you do . I 'm sorry , love , but you don 't get to sit this one out . None of us do . Get to work . - Don 't ... - Why , are you nervous ? - No , I get motion sickness . - Ooh , you get motion sickness ( ! ) I 'm just helping you ... Stop it . Oh . Good afternoon . You 're looking well , as are your latest results . Yeah , I 'm valuable data to you . Just like Sarah 's ovary . Hard science requires hard choices . You 've made them yourself in your own treatment . - The difference now is ... we make those choices together . - OK . So , when were you going to tell us about the Castor dude who escaped ? It was my first item of business . How did you find out ? I don 't think we 're sharing yet , are we ? Scott has a question for you . Er ... I ... Well ... If we had the original genome , that would solve everything . So ... was it really destroyed ? Or is that just another classified secret ? Believe me , I want your source material as much as you do . But thanks to the Duncans , it 's lost to us . Why the Duncans ? Leda started as a military experiment under their guidance . Yeah . I got that . When the military shut down the Duncans , Dyad recruited them . They brought the Leda genome with them . But they had sourced genetic donors for two lines - a female subject and a male . Professor Duncan didn 't mention male clones . No , he didn 't . So ... who were these original donors ? The Duncans took that to their graves . Falsified the records . Hid their identities . We thought Castor died on the vine . So , both the Leda and Castor originals are lost . Correct . Yet another mystery . So , what , that 's it ? I just go home ? If we find them , we 'll charge them , OK ? - Yeah ? What if they come after me ? - Look , if you see either ... Excuse me a second . Hey ! You can 't show your face around here . - Are you out of your goddamn mind ? - What did you learn ? - Nothing . - They 're long gone . - Is that her ? - Yes . - Can I talk to her ? - Absolutely not . Abs ... Hi , I 'm , er , Detective Beth Childs . I 'd like to ask you a few follow-up questions . Beth . I 've got this . Look , I know what those guys are capable of . If you could just walk me through what happened . It will be brief . And then when I tried to leave , Rudy , if that 's even his real name , he got this look in his eye , and it was like he was angry for the other one , Seth , like I had insulted them by rejecting him ... I thought he was going to kill me . Then what happened ? They went through my ID , wrote down all my information in this little notebook . And then Seth yanked out a piece of my hair and put it in a bag . Like , what is that ? Is that a trophy ? - It 's assault . - Yeah , but I consented to the first guy , so that 's not rape , right ? I 'm sorry you had to go through that . Yeah , me too . It 's time to get you home . - Thank you for talking to me . - Thank you . You pull something like that again , you are out of my life . Look , they 've got Helena . OK ? I 'm trying to figure out what these maniacs are after . I 'm just grasping at straws . She says they have the same tattoo - left forearm . A picture of a two-headed horse . Stay the hell away from here . ( Here he comes . ) Honey . It 's not too late to reconsider this ... No . No ! Just follow my lead . It 's just ... sometimes when you get started on something , you can - go a little schoop ! You know what I mean ? - No . Hello , Ramon . What 's up ? Donnie Hendrix . Who 's this guy ? This is my husband . He 's totally trustworthy . So , what 's this about ? We would like to buy your business . Your inventory and your client list . Everything . We 'll take it off your hands , and you can go off to college - and make something of yourself . - Oh , cool , what are you studying , bro ? Er ... with all due respect , what makes you think you have the stones for this line of work ? - Oh , we have the stones . - Yeah . Don 't doubt our stones , we have ample stones . You said it yourself . Most of your clients are in my circle . So , what do you say ? Some doctors are rich ... Some doctors are rich ... HE SHRIEKS HE MOANS PHONE RINGS Shit . Hey . Are you at your pick-up location ? I 'm not going back to base . What do you mean ? We have orders . I know you 're glitching , brother . It was the booze , I 'm fine ... 'Seth , I saw . ' How long 's it been happening ? A week ... or maybe two . 'Then there 's no choice . ' I 'm not going to stand by and watch it happen . You hear ? It 's getting worse ... I don 't know what to do ... CLATTERING We 're going to finish the job . According to the myth , Castor was a warrior horseman . Bit of a badass , by the looks of it ... Well , that fits with what Cal found . He says the horse tattoo is some kind of black ops insignia . That makes sense . They 're purpose-raised ... . untraceable , the perfect ghost soldiers . So , why did they take the woman 's hair ? I don 't know , medical testing ? If he got a follicle , that 's like a gold mine . This doesn 't get me any closer to Helena , Cos . Well , there is one option , Sarah , but you 're not going to like it . I 'm not going to S. She can get you in touch with Paul . Paul can piss off and take S with him ! - They 're the bloody problem . - Which makes them our best lead . All mangoes are golden . Nothing golden is cheap . - Conclusion - all mangoes are cheap . - SHRILL VOICE : - Did he say mangoes ? Is that a sound conclusion ? Based on those statements ? We like mangoes . Please concentrate . All mangoes are cheap . True or false ? Where are these mangoes ? Where are these mangoes ? Do I have to explain the exercise again ? I would like to see these mangoes . The doctor asked a question . I met your brother . He 's ugly . OK . That 's enough . Keep provoking them and we 'll never get any mangoes . Silence , insect . Helena ? Let 's walk . I will say this about the place - the air is good at night , and I can smoke where I want . You must be very early on . A week ? Two ? Makes you quite a special case , doesn 't it ? Ask the last person who told me that . Huh . The Mark-faced boys . They are your babies ? They came to me when they were very young . The irony of it ? Never wanted kids . Didn 't think it was for me . Next thing I know , I 've got more than I can count . How unpleasant . I think you should know how you got here , Helena . Your family sold you out . Sarah sold you out . They decided you were expendable . I don 't believe you . You can be sure of this - you 're not expendable to me . Or my boys . You 've overcome so much . Your upbringing . Your biology . Your fate . We 're going to find out how . KNOCK ON DOOR - Hi . - Is she here ? - Yeah . Hang on a mo ' . She got three broken ribs . All right ? And I think she might be concussed , because she 's being weirdly straightforward . - So , go easy on her . - Mm-hm . Hey , S. I need to get in touch with Paul . He 's gone dark . He got what he wanted . Then we 're done . - Cal 's doing you no favours pretending you can have a life here . - Save it ! You have to take Kira away . I 'm not taking advice from somebody who sold my sister ! That was my decision and I 'll live with it . But Kira shouldn 't have to . I don 't know where Castor comes from , what they want , who they answer to , Like you , I 'm in the dark ... But you don 't fight in these conditions . You run . I know . I 've been there before . When ? In London , when you were young . The forces against us grew beyond my grasp until ... I did what any mother would do . I gathered my children , and I left . Bailey Downs , kiss your troubles goodbye . We got norco , benzo , oxy , proplodrank , you name it ... Street value ... ? - 80 grand . - And your cost ... ? Raw cost ? 25 . But I have a brand . - I 've built up goodwill . - We 'll pay for that , too . What ? ! Client list ? - All in here . - We 'll give you 32 for the works . - Whoa , whoa , honey . - Cash . Or ... we set up a consignment agreement , so we don 't incur all of the risk . 35 . 32 ... firm , and that 's us doing you a favour . I can live with that . I 'm just going to talk to my business associate ! Hey ! Donnie , what is your problem ? We don 't have anything like that kind of money . We have cash in our retirement plan , don 't we ? This is not just much-needed income . This is a constituent list . This is about the election ? It 's about our kids . I have just found my voter base . And I suspect they 'll be very loyal supporters , don 't you ? HE CHUCKLES You little schemer ... ( Let 's do this . ) OK . OK . OK , open her up . Yes , ma 'am . DOOR BANGS DOG BARKS - Shh ... - Easy . Turn around . Hands on your head . Middle of the room . Let 's go slow . Why was Sarah in Marion Bowles ' basement yesterday ? Ask her . She wants to talk to you . She has no idea what she 's into here , Cal . And neither do you . You infiltrated Dyad . Did you find what you were looking for ? Or no ... That 's why the tactics changed . The Helena deal , and the Castor boys put in play . You must be real proud of the work they 're doing , Paul . I am very surprised to see you settling . I had you figured for a roamer . Yeah ? You got a file on me ? Oh , you are a person of interest in many quarters , as you well know . Come on , man . That 's what designing weapons gets you . It 's ancient history . I got out . Oh , you got rich . Then you got out . Or does Sarah not know that part ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'd probably keep the secret , too . " War profiteer " doesn 't really ... square with this whole thing . Where 's Helena ? The deal that was cut , it was to buy Sarah time and space , so why isn 't she taking it ? You 've met her . If she keeps coming ... it 's going to end badly for everyone , I guarantee it . And you need to tell her that , Cal ... cos she won 't hear it from me . You need to get her out of here . Are we going to live with Cal ? I don 't know . Maybe . When he 's set up . Why ? How do you feel about that ? I want to . Yeah . I think I want to , too . Can we sleep in the fort tonight ? Ah ! Yes ! Ye-heh-es ! But first you have to take a bath , yeah ? Now , get the monkey into the cave . GIRL LAUGHS PHONE VIBRATES RINGING TONE Monkey , it 's ready ! Uh-oh . Monkey . Where are you ? Mommy ! Let her go ... Our last conversation was cut ... short . - She 's not part of this . - She 'll help us focus . Monkey , look at me . Don 't cry , baby . You 're going to be OK . What do you want ? Professor Duncan came to you when he resurfaced . Did he share his research ? Yeah . Disks and scribbles . Do you want that ? Tissue samples . Duncan had tissue samples of the Castor original . Kira , ask your mom where they are . I don 't know anything about that . Think hard , Miss Manning . Hey , hey , buddy , buddy , buddy . - You got a ... got a couple of bucks ? - No , man , I 'm sorry . - Hey , hey , hey . - It 's not a good time , my friend . - Hey , help me out . - Come on . - Come on , come on ! Just ... Come on , help me out . Huh ? All right , let me see what I 've got . You must be the boyfriend . Hey ... I have no business with you , OK ? Just let me past . Hey , well , you know what ? My brother 's not to be disturbed . I can 't leave here empty-handed . GIRL WHIMPERS - Don 't touch her , please . - I 've got people who count on me . You mean Seth ? Some doctors are rich . What ? You look after him , don 't you ? Protecting your brother 's ... How do you know about Seth ? - We were in Turkey once and I had this ... - Uh-huh . Yeah . I had this dish , it was , er , lamb dumplings on a skewer ... and ... and yogurt . Is that what this is about ? Protecting your brother ? No ... No . No ! All fools are rich , so ... So ... take ... Take com ... HE GRUNTS HE SHRIEKS What 's that ? No ! - Mommy ! - Is that Seth ? - That 's Seth , isn 't it ? - Mommy ! He 's sick , isn 't he ? They tampered with you . Shut up ! - Please ! - Shut up ! - No , no , please , no ! - Shut up ! I don 't have the original genome , I don 't have it ! Please , leave my kid ! SETH SHRIEKS Please ! Mommy ! SETH SHRIEKS Put it down ! - Oh . Oh , I didn 't touch him , man . - Put it down ! SETH GROANS Easy . He just ... He just went down . It 's all right . It 's all right . I 'm here , brother . Don 't hold on . Go easy . ( I love you . ) HE SIGHS So , it 's going to be an adventure , monkey . You 're going to see glaciers and hot springs . All kinds of neat stuff . I know it 's tough , baby , but we have to be strong . - OK . Say bye to S , yeah ? - Uh-huh . I 'll miss you . Tell me I 'm doing the right thing . You are . You 're doing the right thing . They 'll make her a target , right ? I 'm dangerous . Yes . You are . You 're a good mum . Good mum . It 's time . Bye . - Please , take care . - Thank you . My people will get you out of the country . Don 't contact yours until then . Understood ? - Yeah . - You 're a good man , Cal . Thank you . She 'll be OK , I promise . Yeah . You ? - I 'll see you . - OK . - Come on . I 'm going to put a stop to this . And then we 'll be together , yeah ? There 's reindeer in Iceland . Oh ! Yeah ? Did your dad tell you that ? He 's going to be with you the whole time . I know that . ( I love you . ) DOOR OPENS OK . So , what now ? SHE SNIFFLES Um , now we find Helena and we finish this shit . How ? Castor has her . So , we go to the one we know . Mark . OK ? Mark ? Mark ? Are you all right ? Go back to sleep . What are you doing ? I 'm almost done . Go to bed . SHOWER RUNS MUFFLED SCREAMS Open the door ! Sarah ! We need to talk ! What is it you 're not telling me ? I 'm not who you think I am . Don 't worry , I can explain . We 've lost contact with Mark . I need Rudy back in the field . Have you two made your decision for school trustee ? Do you seriously think that people are going to trust their children to an infamous alcoholic ?

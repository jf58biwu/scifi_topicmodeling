Some of her group heard rumors about some , um , training centers . Training ... Training for what ? After DC fell , they pulled together a bootleg raid . Some high school in Rockdale . They found her and , like , 50 other women hidden inside . Their kids had been taken away . Zoe , got her out . She was the only one . Those guards at the school were not gonna let those women go . We think , they were , um , looking for fertile women . Gathering them up . When you 're a pro , you 're a pro . All right ? Daddy 's showing off now . So , the ice or bust ? Here he goes . Ooh , ooh . Come on . Get it to the ice . Ice . Ice . Ice . Ice ? Ice ? Do you want to take the ice ? Yes . Come on . Two in a row . Shit . Blaze . Hey , hey . Sorry about that . He 's friendly .

Sorry about that . Well , you folks stay warm . Blaze , let 's go . Let 's go home . Come on , let 's go . You folks have a good day . Thank you . We 've gotta go . Come on , honey . Come on . Careful . Are we heading north ? That 's where Canada is . No , no . I 've gotta ... I 've gotta get out . I 've gotta ... I 've gotta head back to Boston . You were shot . There are soldiers everywhere ... No . I just ... Stop ... Stop the bus . You 'll get caught before you hit Massachusetts . Stop the fucking bus , now . I 'm getting out here . You 're not getting out . I 'm getting out ... We 're not stopping . Sit down . God damn it . We 're going to the coast . You can maybe grab a scoot boat down to Marblehead . Thank you . The car is warming up . Where is she ? In the bathroom . Just one last try . What 's that ? Whitford gave me a gun . It 's just in case . Okay ? Jesus . Do you know how to use it ? Yeah , a little . I know how to load it . Look , we need to be ready , all right , June ? It 's just in case . Then show me how to load it . Come on . All right . Take a bullet outta there . All right . This pops open here . And then you put six in here . You close it . Pull the hammer back and then it fires . Careful . Okay . So just open it here ... Yeah . Close it ... Shh , shh , shh . Stop . Hold up . I 'm a friend . Don 't move . Don 't move . Easy . Easy . You guys are from Boston . I heard it on my scanner . They 're looking for you . Yeah , well , we 're leaving now anyway . So , thanks . Well , they know your car . You gotta stay off the main road . Should we wait for Whitford here ? I don 't know . There 's no sense in that . He 's dead . They caught him . They hung him up on a street lamp in town . He 's a strange guy . I liked him . Look , could you put the gun down ? It 's all right . It 's all right . Look , they 're patrolling all over . You guys can take Campbell Pond Road as far as it goes . I called a friend , so if you guys can make it past Jackman , he 's gonna meet you at the border . Thank you . Thank you . No worries . This is pretty fucked up . Come on . May the Lord guide your steps and bring you to your June and your Hannah . He has not forgotten any of you . Thank you . If you 're ever in Boston , you 'll look me up ? I got it . No , no , I got ... You sure ? You might be able to get a ride out of Cutler . It 's 10 miles south . Good luck . Thank you . Boat leaves soon as it 's dark . Our dock is a half mile down river , if you change your mind . Let me show you something . The town fought back . They tried to hide the fertile women in here . The Guardians took them and strung everyone else up . There 's one of these in every town . This is what they do to people who fight back . It 's the only thing I can do . The US government has people in Canada . They can help you find them , maybe even get them out . No . No . I 'm not ... If you go back , you 're gonna die . You 're gonna die and leave them all on their own . Is that what you want ? I don 't ... I don 't ... He 's coming . Smart . I wasted a whole prayer on you . One of my good ones . Let 's go . We heard Gilead 's starting to patrol with drones . It 's gonna be fast , just straight up the coast to New Brunswick . It 's okay . All aboard . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . You paid for five , not six . Who 's not coming ? We 're all coming . We 're all coming . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . That 's not how this works . All right . This is morphine . It 's Percocet . All right ? It 's a good start . What else you got in there ? Don 't be a motherfucker . Hey ! It 's all right . It 's all right . This a free enterprise . That 'll do . Come on , let 's go ! Let 's move , let 's move . Stow it all away . It 's all right . It 's all right . Grab that line . Come on , I 'm gonna help you down . Go ! Come on . Let 's get outta here ! Come on ! Let 's move . Get down ! Stop ! Stay down ! Stay down . It 's all right . Sorry . Stay down . Stay down . It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's tea . They 'd run outta coffee . Hey , hey , hey , hey . I 'm not in charge of rationing . You 're welcome . It 's nice out , right ? They got the power back on in the apartment . Things ... Hey , no , no , no . That doesn 't mean you get to go back to sitting inside all day . Hey , seriously . No . See ? This is nice , right ? Hello , Mr. Bankole ? Yeah .

So , I think , you 're probably looking for high schools . See , if I was trying to hide a couple of hundred people , then I don 't think that ... Luke . Do you know a woman named June Osborn ? She 's 31 , blonde hair , blue eyes , from Boston ? Yes , my wife . That 's what we thought . This is for you . Where did you get this ? One of our contacts in the Mexican government .

 " X " marks the spot , boys . The treasure should be under these pillars . Where are you , my golden one ? At long last the quest is finally over . The lyre 's mine . - Yeah , boss . - Correction . Since you found it on amazon territory I 'd say it belongs to us . Here . Psych ! No ! No , no , no ! Look , look ... I 'll tell you what ... If you want the lyre so badly , you can pry it from my dead fingers . With pleasure . Well , kids ... If you can 't play nicely with your toy , I 'm gonna have to take it from ya . Xena ... What 's the lyre doing here ? There 's more than one of them . They 're hidden all over the world . It 's Terpsichore 's way of spreading music . - Hi , Gabrielle . - Draco ... What 's wrong with him ? - Baby Bliss put a spell on him . - Creepy . How can you say it 's a spell when I would gladly tear out my own spleen and carve your initials on the side of it just to prove my undying love for you ? I 'm flattered . Check it out , sisters . " Draco , the lionhearted " is really " Draco , the dandelion " . You want a war , amazon ? You 've got one . War ! What is it good for ? Absolutely nothin ' . Uh-huh , yeah . War ! What is it good for ? Absolutely nothin ' . Listen to me now . War is a thing that I despise ' cause it means destruction of innocent lives . War means tears in thousands of mothers ' eyes when their young go out to fight and lose their lives . War ! Good God ! Y 'all ... What is good for ? Absolutely nothin ' . Say it again , yeah . War ! What is it good for ? Absolutely nothin ' . War ! It ain 't nothin ' but a heartbreaker . War ! Free only to the undertaker . War is the enemy of all mankind . The thought of war just blows my mind . War handed down from generation to generation . Induction and destruction . Who wants to die ? War ! What is it good for ? Absolutely nothin ' . Say it again , yeah . War ! What is it good for ? Nothin ' ! Say it again ! War ! What is it good for ? Nothin ' ! Say it again ! War ! What is it good for ? Absolutely nothing . Ok . Since we 're not gonna battle it out how are we gonna decide who gets the lyre ? Oh , there 's gonna be a battle , all right ? Battle of the bands . In the time of ancient gods , warlords and kings a land in turmoil cried out for a hero . She was Xena . A mighty princess forged in the heat of battle . The power ... The passion ... The danger ... Her courage will change the world . XENA , THE WARRIOR PRINCESS All right , listen up . Playing music 's the way for a muse to inspire and the best-sounding band will win Terpsichore 's lyre . If the people don 't mind there 's a contest for peace and we 'll do it right here ... In Melodia ... Music capital of Greece ! - Hi , Vargus ! - Hi , Spiro ! What 's the hurry ? Why the scurry ? Where 's the fire ? Why the lyre ? Did you hear ? There 's a concert in town ! - Hi , Cory ! - Hi , Sarah ! News I 'm bringing . Time for singing . Can you hum ? Get your drum .

Here 's your note in your key . - That 's too high . - Not for me . Hello , miss Leandra . I am Alabartus . Won 't you let me sing with you ? Got no talent . I got money . I just need to bribe that judge . - Oh , they think they 're so cool . - We 've got talent . - Playing music 's a gag . - We 've got music . - When you get onstage ... - We got singing . ... they 'll fall down on them . Hello , kind barbarians . I am Alabartus . Please , just let me sing with you . - But you 've got it all wrong . - Gettin ' ready ! - There 's no talent to find . - Gettin ' ready ! - If this concert 's too big ... - Gettin ' ready ! - ... I 'll go out of my mind ! - When you gotta sing really gotta sing ! When the music plays then my hips will sway . What you gonna do ? What you gonna do ? - Is there really a jam ? - Whoa , man ! - Can I participate ? - Whoa , man ! - Should I go there right now ? - Whoa , man ! Or is it too late ? - Gettin ' ready !

Yes , there 's really a jam for you and the rest . So , put down your sitars and give it your best . Gettin ' ready ! Gettin ' ready ! Gettin ' ready ! Ready to ... Gettin ' ready ! Gettin ' ready ! So I 'm figuring this 'll be a great place for a stage . Xena ! The word is out . The bands are coming from everywhere . I guess the contest is gonna be bigger than we thought . - Yeah . - Well ... Everybody deserves a chance . Gabrielle , why don 't you just audition each band as it comes in and make a first cut ? Good girl . Joxer , get together some villagers . See if you can build a stage . I 'm figuring here . Ok . - Yeah ! - Xena ! Mom ! So it 's true ! And when were you going to tell me ? Amphipolis was my very next stop . Well , you look positively radiant ! When are we gonna meet your ... special someone ? If you mean the father , the answer 's " never " . He 's not in my life . But Xena , every child needs a father ! You raised me on your own . I attest that would have been much easier with help . I have help , Mom . You have now . - The place is rocking ! - Yeah ! Gabrielle , sign them up . Kill me , please . Aw , come on ... They can 't all be ... - ... mediocre . - No , they all suck . Sadly everyone in the music capital of Greece is tone deaf . Maybe not everyone . Come on . Everyone ! Why don 't you all throw up your hands and feel my rhythm ? Another one ? That 's my brother , Jace . We get it on ' most every night . And when that moon gets big and bright it 's a supernatural delight . Everybody was dancing in the moonlight . Everybody here is out of sight . They don 't bark and they don 't bite . They keep it loose . They keep it light . Everybody was dancing in the moonlight . Dancing in the moonlight ! Everybody feeling warm and bright . It 's such a fine and natural sight ... Everybody 's dancing in the moonlight . We like our fun but never fight . You can 't dance and stay uptight . It 's a supernatural delight . Everybody was dancing in the moonlight . Dancing in the moonlight ! Everybody feeling warm and bright . It 's such a fine and natural sight ... Everybody 's dancing in the moonlight . - Bella ! - Come on ! Bella , mi amigo , bella ! You think that was something ? This is how we dance before breakfast where I come from . Repeat after me ! Ole , ole ! Dancing in the moonlight ! Everybody feeling warm and bright . It 's such a fine and natural sight ... Everybody 's dancing in the moonlight . Dancing in the moonlight ! Everybody feeling warm and bright . It 's such a fine and natural sight ... Everybody 's dancing ... bailando ! Yeah ! You fall off the circus wagon , boy ? We don 't like your kind around here , freak . Draco ! - Let 's take him . - But Gabrielle ... I am just trying to keep you from being infected by this lily-livered panty-twist . You harm so much as a hair on Jace 's head I 'll scalp you . Good luck in the contest . Need a hand , killer ? Where ? Me ? Yeah ... I am a killer . In fact I can kill a person with a cold stare . But , you know , inside I 'm delicate as a daisy . I 'm , I 'm inside . Don 't try so hard , Joxer . Didn 't anyone ever tell you the quickest way to win a woman 's heart is by making her laugh ? Well , in that case , I 'm the sexiest man in the world . There you are ! Joxer ! Damn . Who 's that guy ? Why don 't you wait here ? I 'll be back in a moment . You crazy fellow . You ... Give your big brother a hug . No , Jace . No ! - Play the game ... - No . - Play the game ! - No , Jace . Not now . Where is he ? I don 't see my little brother ! Where is he ? There he is ! Where have you been ? I was starting to think I was an only child . Look , Jace ... I 'm a grown-up now . I 'm not your little baby brother . And ... I 'm a warrior with a reputation to protect . I follow my sword . I follow the music , wherever it takes me . I thought you 'd be happy it took me to you . Yeah , made my day . Now quit talkin ' like that . - Like what ? - Like ... I don 't know . That stupid accent of yours , like you 're from Spain or somethin ' . You 're from Olympic Street in Athens two blocks from Akhmar , the meatman , just like me . Well , not just like you . I don 't have a pasta strainer for a shirt . Just stay away from me Bro . My own brother insulting me . Can you believe it ? As a matter of fact , I can . Joxer likes to think that he knows who he is but all he really knows is who he wants to be . That 's right . And who would not want to be just like me ? Xena ! Meet Phillipis . He 's a healer . Tell Xena about all the exciting things you 've been doing with leeches . Well , that 's great , because I could sure use a doctor about now . Could you give me and Mom just a moment ? Thanks . All right , I 'm telling you for the last time politely . I do not need help finding a man . No ? But finding the right man ! Now that 's a different story . I 'm beginning to remember why I left home so young . Joxer ... What ? What is your problem ? Why were you so rude to your brother ? Look , Gabrielle , you don 't understand . Things are different . We 're not kids anymore . I 'm a warrior now , and Jace is still Jace . So you 're telling me that you 're so heartless towards him because he 's ... Different ? Different . And he is ... Yes ? He 's wasting his life . He is ... wasting his life . That 's it . - I am a warrior , and he is ... - Your brother ? No matter what else he is , he will always be that . Hey , Joxer . My band 's rehearsing our moves . You wanna watch , handsome ? Do birds fly ? Do bees buzz ? Do I take a bath once a month whether I need it or not ? You bet . Hold that . Let 's go . You 're not on the back burner now . You 're smokin ' . Xena , right ? - Who wants to know ? - I saw your ad . " Single greek female seeks marriage with stable provider ... " " ... to raise a child and to dote on an exceptionally wonderful mother ... " " ... who doesn 't look a day over twenty . " Gee , I wonder who wrote that . It wasn 't you ? No , I am not in the market for a husband . Yeah . Sure . I understand . How ' bout a little casual sex ? 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and step and kick and twist and punch . No , ladies ! It 's step , kick , twist , punch . Not step , kick , punch , twist . Again , slowly . Step , kick , twist , punch . Why do I care ? It is Joxer . Ain 't love grand ? Draco , I 'm busy . I 've come to talk to you about our future . Now I 'm a changed man . My warlord days are well behind me and when I win that lyre , I will prove it to you in song . - I 'm the reason you want ... ? - ... The lyre ? Of course it is ! When I win that melodious instrument I will serenade you for all eternity . That 's very sweet in a completely deranged , obsessed kind of way . Draco , you do not love me . You 're under a spell . Call it what you will , my love . ... Just as long as you marry me . We could have a wedding in spring and a honeymoon in Crete . The answer is " no " . Your lips say " no " , but your eyes scream " yes " . Don 't make me say it in a way you won 't like . I will never give up on us , Gabrielle . You may kiss me . Don 't even think about it . Let me get this through your thick skull . I would not marry you if you were the last man on Earth . She wants me . I walk along these city streets you used to walk along with me . And every step I take recalls how much in love we used to be . Oh , how can I forget you ? When there is always something there to remind me ! Always something there to remind me ! I was born to love you and I will never be free . You 'll always be a part of me . When shadows fall , I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night . And I can 't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight . Oh , how can I forget you ? When there is always something there to remind me ! Always something there to remind me ! I was born to love you and I will never be free . You 'll always be a part of me . Gabrielle ! If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share , just come back to the places where we used to go . And I 'll be there . Oh , how can I forget you ? When there is always something there to remind me ! When there is always something there to remind me ! Always something there to remind me ! When there is always something there to remind me ! Always ! Something ! Always ! Something ! If I can 't have you , Gabrielle , no one will ! Yes , that 's the groove , right there . I like this groove . Yes , this does it for me . Oh , very much , very good . Yes , I like this one a lot . Turn around , that 's it ... Back , back , step , step . - What are you smilin ' at ? - Your brother . Oh , oh , yeah . I 'm really sorry about that . I 'm so sexy ! What are you apologizing for ? Look at him . He 's amazing ! He 's so uninhibited ... Now that is a true sign of a secure man . Oh , oh ... Yeah , yeah . I 'm just sorry he 's not dancing more . You know ... So ... Think you could get him to teach me some of those moves ? Oh , yeah . Anything for you . You know ... Uninhibitedness runs in my family . Joxer ... Yeah ? You 're trying too hard again . Right . I 'll go ... get Jace . Come on , girls . - Hi . - Xena ... I ... - I wanna ask you something . - Well , make it snappy . I 've got a lot of single greek losers to turn down . What do you think about Amoria ... for Joxer ? Works for me . Are you crazy ? Why did you ask me if you already have an answer ? Because she 's so wrong for him . He should be with someone that 's like like ... You ? Come on , Xena . Well ... Hey , if you 're not gonna take him it 's not fair of you to stop someone else from tryin . Jace ? How are ya , bro ? Listen . I know whatcha thinkin ' . I 've been acting crummy to ya and I probably shouldn 't ' a said what I said . - Really ? - Look ... You 're a grown man . You wanna dress like a clown and act like a spaz , that is none of my business . Joxer ... - Back in the old country ... - Jace ... You 're not from the old country and you 're not from Spain and I doubt very much if you 've ever even had a plate of Paella . I am ... your older brother by half an hour . And I see that is going to make all the difference in the world . I ' cept your apology because I know it is as good as I 'm ever gonna get from you . Because you obviously don 't know any better . Adios . All right , come on . The concert 's starting soon . Xena , right ? She left town . Just missed her . Before you say no , hear me out . I may not look like much , but ... in a few years when my face clears up I 'll grow up to be the kind of man your child will be proud to call Dad . You know what , kid ... That is the nicest offer I 've had all day . You shouldn 't be in so much of a hurry to grow up . Mother ... I 'm going to kill you . All I want is for you to have a family , Xena . I have a family . I 've got Gabrielle . I 've got Joxer . And as much as it pains me to say it ... I 've got you . This child 's life will be filled with more than enough love . Still it doesn 't replace a father . For crying out loud , what century are you living in ? There was a time when they used to say that behind every great man there had to be a great woman . But in these times of change , you know , it 's no longer true . So we 're comin ' out of the kitchen ' cause there 's somethin we forgot to say to you , yeah . Sisters are doin ' it for themselves . ( Girl , isn 't that true ? ) Standin ' on their own two feet . Ringin ' on their own bells . This is a song to celebrate ... Yeah ! ... the conscious liberation of the female state . I 'm talkin ' ' bout a state of mind . Mothers and daughters and their daughters too . Woman to woman we 're singin ' with you . Sisters are doin ' it for themselves . Standin ' on their own two feet . Ringin ' on their own bells . We ain 't makin ' stories and we ain 't laying ' plans . 'Cause a man still loves a woman and a woman still loves a man . That 's right . Sisters are doin ' it for themselves . Standin ' on their own two feet . Ringin ' on their own bells . ( Oh , ringing ' on my bells . ) Sisters are doin ' it for themselves . Standin ' on their own two feet . Ringin ' on their own bells . Sisters are doin ' it for themselves . Standin ' on their own two feet . Ringin ' on their own bells . Sisters are doin ' it for themselves . Standin ' on their own two feet . Ringin ' on their own bells . Sisters are doin ' it for themselves . I love it ! I love it ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! You 've always danced to the beat of your own drum , Xena . I suppose it would be foolish of me to stop you now . Thanks , Mom . Now , who did you say the father was ? Everything ok , boss ? Does everything look ok ? The woman I love ... My sweet , beautiful Gabrielle has spurned my advances . No ! No . Not spurned . She ha ... She hates me ! Hey ... Don 't let it getcha down . I mean ... There 's plenty other chicks in the sea . Gabrielle is not a chick . Her and I are soulmates . And as long as she 's alive I will never be able to love again . But what about the concert ? I mean ... Me and the boys are really lookin ' forward to rockin ' down . We 'll perform , all right . In fact we 're gonna slay ' em . Let 's go , for cryin ' out loud ! Get on with the show ! We still need you to perform . Can you please just warm up in the dressing room ? No , you need ... You need to put on your costume . Just go to the left . It 's on a rack . Could we please clear this area ? What 's going on ? Come on , the crowd 's going wild . Xena , nobody wants to be the first band . All right ... You go out there and stall . I 'll deal with the bands . All right ! Come here ! The concert 's about to start . All right . I need to make an announcement . There 's some bad slouvaki going around so stay away from the slouvaki . Hey , hey ! It 's not that bad . Gabrielle ! All right ! Draco . You 're on . This is your last chance , Gabrielle . - Marry me , my love . - Draco , no ! Have it your own way . But you 're part of the act now and for our grand finale you get to die . Yeah , as if it 's gonna start you know ? I mean ... Right now it 's time to ... ! Right now it 's time to ... ! Right now it 's time to check out the jams , brothers and sisters ! Come on ! I gotta kick ' em out ! Well , I 'm feelin ' pretty good and I guess that I could get crazy now , baby . 'Cause we all gotta do what the dressing room make . I know how you want it , girl . Hot , quick , and tight . The girl gets hotter when you 're doin ' it right . So let me up on the stand . Let me kick out the jams ! Yeah ! Kick out the jams ! I gotta kick ' em out ! I 'm trying to touch you . You know , my jet 's on fire . Well , I feel you ! Yeah ! From the sounds of the fire that resounds in the sky . When I touch you now , baby . You can 't do without . When you got that feelin you got to sock ' em out . So put the mike in my hands ! Let me kick out the jams ! Yeah ! Kick out the jams ! I gotta kick ' em out ! Help me ! I need something * heavy ! ( * heavy metal ) Anything , please ! - How ' bout a * rock ? ( * rock ) - Rock ? Yeah ! - Can rock ! - Here ! - Come on ! - Rock him with this ! Goodbye , my love . Get her ! Gabrielle ! Wait for me , my love ! Xena ! - Xe ... - Come back ! Time to die , Gabrielle . Show 's over , loverboy . The name 's Draco ! Give me my props ! 'Cause I 'm the gee when the music stops ! I 'm the baddest momma jammer this side of Thrace . Your expression 's gonna change when I 'm in your face . No , I 'm the baddest rapper there is , and you 're the saddest there is , and that 's the way it is . You 're just a copycat . That 's where your head is at . You chase the rhythm from a place you was never at . Ain 't nobody told you that * payback 's a mother ? ( * playback ) Heads up , my brother , 'cause here comes another . It 's time to face the funk blasting ' atcha ! You better give it up 'cause you ain 't gonna match my rhyme ! Just like old times when you be trippin ' in your own stuff didn 't know what . I 'm the number one warlord , king of the Horde ! And I 'm out to collect my reward ! Let 's get it on , 'cause I 'm gettin ' bored . There now . That 's so much better . I just love a man in uniform . You all right ? Yeah ... Oh ... What do you think ? Joxer , she 's a rocker chick . What d 'you expect ? I have to admit , I thought it was kind of strange seeing you with her . It 's only ' cause I 'm so used to your ... You know . Being around me and ... that kind of thing . Like a puppy-dog . That 's not what I meant . Gabrielle , you are sort of used to having me around when you need me . I know I take advantage of you , Joxer , but I care about you . You mean a lot to me . Ok . - So , what are you doin ' tonight ? - Not a chance in Tartarus . Right , because I have lots to do , as it gets later . Oh , good . Xena ! Xena ! Xena ! Xena ! Xena , come quick ! The crowd 's going wild ! They want an encore ! I 'd love to , but I 'm fresh out of asses to kick ! But you just won Terpsichore 's lyre ! But if you don 't want it , I 'll put it in my living room ... Maybe next to the bed , or something . Xena ! Xena ! Xena ! Xena ! Now , Terpsichore wanted this lyre to spread music so I don 't think that it 's fair that only one person should own it . And that 's why I 'm leaving it here in the musical capital of Greece . Because Melodia ... You rock ! All the world over so easy to see people everywhere just wanna be free . Listen , please listen , that 's the way it should be .

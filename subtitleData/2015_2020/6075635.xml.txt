 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... You know , you have that secret to keep under wraps . This again ? Oh , now Mack 's in on it . I 'm just wondering if it means you 're bringing Hunter in - on the other thing . - No . I shouldn 't have to ask any of you to save one of our own . - You never ask ! - That 's enough ! You survived the destruction because ... you caused it . I 'm pretty sure the DNA results we 're running right now are gonna confirm it . There 's something wrong with you . Her DNA is an exact match to what it was before . She 's clear . What did you just do ? Switched your blood results with your old samples . The new samples are different ? Drastically . For now , we should just keep it between us . There 's something very wrong with me . 2x12 - " Who You Really Are " _ _ _ _ _ _ Kava . I must find Kava . Sorry . I don 't know who that is . Do you guys ? Hey . A pretty lady like you shouldn 't be out here all alone . I can help you find Kava . I can help you with anything else that you need . Lady ! Who the hell are you ? ! I do not know . Not bad . But once I 'm pinned , you should try for a finishing blow . You want full " Mortal kombat " ? - I want you to stop holding back , Skye . - I didn 't want to hurt you . I didn 't want to try to hurt you . I feel like I 'm constantly on the verge of ... - I don 't know . - Look ... we lost Trip , and it hurts like hell , but you can 't shut those feelings out . Can 't sustain that . Well , what 's my option ? I just lose it right here ? We 've talked about this . Control . Embrace your emotions , your nerves . Use them ... on your terms . I don 't know . What I 'm feeling is pretty ... dark . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna go postal and tear your head off . Go for it . I promise you won 't . Maybe Skye needs a break . - Training is not a group activity . - Yeah . I just came down to ... Have ... Uh , see what ... I-it 's about . I 'll tell you what , Fitz ... come back in an hour . I 'd be happy to show you what it 's all about . I 'm fine , Fitz . Really . It would be pretty funny to see you and Fitz go at it ... - Okay . Guess we 're back on . - And not holding back . Water . So ... Coulson calls me into his office the other day . Hmm ? I thought he was gonna read me the riot act ... S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s rules about fraternizing with fellow operatives . They 're strict . But ... he made me an offer . Wants to make my position here permanent . He 's shorthanded now . You thinking about it ? Well , wasn 't thinking of leaving anytime soon . And I wouldn 't mind taking on some more responsibility . Responsibility ? Did you hear the words that just came out of your mouth ? Yeah . That sounded a bit strange , didn 't it ? Yeah . Who is that guy ? I don 't know . But I do not trust him . Anyhow , can 't hurt . Plus , this is fun . Oh . Fun was never a problem for us . No , you 're right . That part was always easy . Till things go South . Yeah , then you turn into a bit of a nightmare . I remember it well . You tell me . It seems the thing that always came between us was your dedication to S.H.I.E.L.D. Now we 're on the same team . It 's simpler . The last Stark copper jackets . I 'll make sure hill puts them on the list . Anything else ? Sir , I can handle inventory myself . And I hope this isn 't about my reaction after ... No , I told you ... we 're fine . After Puerto Rico , we need to take stock . What happened out there was ... Yeah , I don 't like thinking about that . I don 't blame you , but I have been thinking about it , and I realized I 've been wasting your talents . Sir ? Look , I know you love it under the hood of a car , but ... I could really use you out in the field . You 're a force to be reckoned with , Mack . Believe me . Okay , but violence isn 't really my thing . You know , that alien crap made me into something I 'm not . I know . But have you seen yourself ? You 're a little bit of a beast all the time . A blue-dot operative in Portugal phoned in . You should hear what he has to say . Looks like you 're starting now . Oh , you 'll want everyone on the bus for this . Thank you for watching her . I hear from the prime minister 's office I 'm to hold this crazy lady here for you , I hold this crazy lady . How did you subdue her and get her to wait ? No subduing . She stayed willingly once I told her I 'd found " Kava " and he was on his way to meet her . Oh . But I 'm not Kava . I 'm glad I 'm not the one who has to tell her that . Pick up her sword from booking before you go . - So you are not Kava . - No . But I 'm a friend . " Son of Coul " ? See ? We 've worked together before . I apologize . I do not remember . - You have no memory of who you are ? - I-I know I am from Asgard . But I do not remember my home there . You tell me my name is Lady Sif , but ... why I left Asgard , what brought me here to Midgard ... why I wear these hides instead of armor ... - a mystery . - One I 'll help you solve . - I 'm sure a clue will turn up somewhere . - Twitter . Skye found it . That 's me . I don 't remember this . I 'm a decent fighter . This guy can hold his own against you . Impressive . Last time you were here , you came to collect a rogue Asgardian . That would explain his strength . Regardless , she traveled across the universe to find him . He 's dangerous . Make that more than dangerous . We know you were after him . Question is , what 's he after ? _ Take me to your supplies , powering elements ... fuel ! Do not try and fight me . Someone on your world has changed . I am here to hunt them down . What do you ... What do you want from me ? Don 't worry . You won 't remember . We found a couple of other videos of the fight , and we 've been analyzing them frame by frame , which ... Which didn 't get us much in the way of , um ... - Of anything new . - Yeah . Thanks . Um , until we get to ... here . I do very much enjoy that part . So , he ... he 's ... he 's wearing something ... - something mechanical , and she nailed it . - And there 's more . What is that ? - Blood ? - Hope so . It could give us a lead . Well , there 's no way to know from the video . Once we land , Fitz , you go with Hunter and Mack , handle forensics . I need you and Bobbi to talk to witnesses in the area , see if we can track down where this guy went . Sir , the science division has loaded the team with heavier suppression artillery . After Raina 's vanishing act , we advise that when you find this ... man , you contain him first , ask questions later . - New icers are still in development . - Very good . Keep me posted . - New icers ? - Oh . The mechanical design is still top-notch , but we 're looking into a more concentrated dendrotoxin formula . - And wouldn 't that be dangerous ? - But effective . Given these elevated threats , we can 't risk it not being . My mind is that of a lost adolescent . - I can provide no information of value . - Not totally true . Judging by your clothes , we know you were undercover , probably something you learned after your last visit here . Your usual full-armor look is a little more ... conspicuous . So you 're saying I wear that armor most of the time ? - Mhm . - Does this mean I 'm a warrior ? - A good one . - A great warrior . It 's just details that you 're missing . You must remember things about your home world , right ? - Only basic lessons a child could learn . - The name of your sword ? What about Thor ? Um ... I do not know this word , yet when you say it , I ... want to smile . Why ? Who can explain the mysteries of the Asgardian brain ? I can . I can 't see any blood . Fitz , isn 't there some special light that finds blood ? Not blood . What 's up , Magnum , P.I. ? You enjoying this ? Who doesn 't like a good mystery ? Guess we 're both embracing new challenges . That mean you 're taking the permanent position that Coulson offered ? He 's a man down . I know you have your reservations , but I like the guy . Don 't you want to see how this plays out ? Huh . - What 's that ? - I don 't know . This is about where the big guy was standing When Sif nailed him with the sword , right ? - Yeah . - Look at this . Ohh ! I-I barely touched it . I swear . Trust me ... there is no universe on which I think you did that on your own . Turbo , what do you think ? - Simmons ? - Yes , Fitz . We 're uploading some information to you . Whatever came out of that guy 's chest I 'm guessing it wasn 't blood . - I 'll give it a look . - See ? Who doesn 't like a good mystery ? _ _ _ You speak Portuguese ? I 'm no expert . It 's a pretty language . It 's hard to gauge if someone 's lying . - Are you an expert at that ? - At lying or telling if someone 's lying ? I have a feeling you 're probably an expert at both . Can I help you ? Hi , yes , we 're looking for anyone who may have been injured in the incident at the pier or may have seen this man . Hmm . No , he does not look familiar to me . As far as the injuries , I can ask around . The nurse who was working earlier took ill . So we are short-staffed . It may take a while . Okay . Well , we 'll be here . _ _ Wait . Is that woman all right ? What happened to her ? _ Yet you do not serve a king ? Not really how it works with us . I wonder if I serve the king as the great warrior you say I am . Odin ? Oh , we know you do . You 've met him . - Shut ... up . - It 's her ! I was just conducting my interview with Mr. Cardozo here , asking him what he saw the other day , when ... - You are a dangerous monster . - I am no monster . I am sometimes dangerous , but only toward those who are deserving . I do not actually know . Is it only toward those who are ... - No , that was right . - Excellent . Answer his question , elderly man . Look , just tell us what you saw after they fought . The man destroyed my booth ! What does he want with balloons ? He went for my helium , broke off the valves , and took them ! What does he need those for ? Sir , the boys were right . That definitely wasn 't blood . - What are we talking about ? - It was liquid nitrogen . The post was frozen solid and cracked . He must have been carrying a supply , and Sif must have damaged his containment hardware . So that 's what he needed the tank valves for ... to repair it . - Why carry nitrogen ? - Might have needed it for fuel , might have needed it for a weapon . If he 's alien , he might need it to breathe . Not to breathe . Only seven intelligent species across the known realms require heightened levels of nitrogen gas , none humanoid . I learned this as a child . Did you not ? Bobbi , anything ? Sir , we have evidence he 's here at the hospital . It 's a big place , though . He might be hiding anywhere . Well , we know he needs nitrogen , and they use it in hospitals to power surgical equipment . Let 's start there . You do not want to fight me . We just have some questions for you . Simmons is tending to Bobbi . She 's gonna be okay . The guy was blue , like " he just tested some Willy Wonka gum " blue , and he needed nitrogen for whatever device turned his skin pink . Do you think he 's a Kree ? You told me last year the Kree had not visited our realm . If a Kree came to your world unannounced now , I would assume he 's up to no good . He attacked Bobbi and Skye , so that 's a yes . Yeah . The guy throws a mean punch . Let 's assume you were here to stop him . We still don 't know his objective . No , but knowing he is Kree helps . Kava , for example . I thought it was a name . 'Tis a Kree word . You also learn other species entire languages as a child ? " Kava " means " keys . " - Keys ? - A device used to unlock ... Yeah , I know keys . It 's something . Let 's look into it . Skye ... thank you for engaging my enemy . You are quite brave . The whole room was shaking , Fitz . - The gun in my hand exploded . - Oh , god . I-I thought that I could handle it . But I can 't . It 's too much . I-I think we have to tell Coulson what 's happening . Hang on . Wait . Just wait until I 've or ... analyzed ... I can 't control it when I get upset or nervous . I 'm running that diagnostic on your blood samples right now . Hopefully , when it 's done , we 'll have a solution . There 's nothing you ... Sorry to interrupt ... whatever this is . Just wanted to check out the new toys from sci-tech . Okay . I 'm ... gonna ... scour the web for " key " references . Yeah . Yeah , you do that . - You , Ms. Morse , will live . - That 's a relief . I 'll get you some antibiotic cream so we can keep you nice and uninfected . - Thanks . - Stay here . Ah . There goes your modeling career . You should talk , pretty boy . - You talk to Hunter ? - I did . - He 's thinking about sticking around . - I heard . I think it 's good . Things are good . Maybe ... we should bring him on board . No chance . That ship has sailed . Besides the fact that you two have a pattern that repeats itself , you didn 't tell him in the first place because you didn 't want him to know that you 'd been lying to him . Trust has never been our strong suit . And ... And we 're building something real here . I know he thinks so . But how is he gonna feel if you tell him now ? Well , you can 't risk it . He 'll react badly . And it could blow up in our face in a big way . You can 't bring him in on this , Bobbi . W-what am I supposed to do ? I can 't bring him ... I don 't want him here in case he takes their side . He 's a friend . I don 't want him fighting against us . - He would never . - Oh . He loves you , and he probably will always love you . But I still think he might be capable of killing you . You 're telling me to push him away . I 'm saying it 's the only way you 'll ever have a chance to be together , to make it work someday . You remember what it felt like when our friends turned out to be Hydra . - We 're not Hydra . - You remember how it felt . The best thing would be if he decided to leave and he wasn 't anywhere near here when we pull the trigger on this thing . And then ... maybe there 's a world where we 're all friends in the end . I 'm saying I can 't find any particular keys that would be hugely important , not literal keys , not metaphorical keys , not as in " to the city . " It doesn 't mean that I ... Wait . Look at this . " Chaves . " A city known for its sedimentary basins . I don 't ... - Guess what " chaves " means in English . - Let me guess . " Keys . " That 's where the Kree was heading . That 's where I was chasing him . That was my mission . But Chaves , Portugal ... we 've seen that name before . It was in Whitehall 's SSR file . The site of his dig back in 1945 , where he first found the Obelisk . - That 's where we have to go . - Director ? - I 'd like to sit this one out , please . - You all right ? Yeah , just after my run-in with blue man group , I still feel a little banged-up , and I 'm just worried I 'm not gonna be much help out there , so ... Okay . Whenever you 're ready . Is it really about being hurt , or is it about your nerves ? I promise , it 's just about the guy making me see cartoon birdies all around my head . That 's it . Have Simmons give you one more check while we 're gone . - Let 's make sure there 's nothing serious . - O-okay . Pull up the SSR file . I want to pinpoint exactly where this Kree guy 's going . Stay right there . Put your hands up . - You will not stop me . - Want to bet ? - I am here to help . - Is that why you attacked me , Kree ? You were the one who attacked . I had to take your memory to keep you from tracking me . How did you track me ? You do not ask the questions , Kree . You do not talk . Actually ... we need him to talk . Look , I-I can prove that ... that I 'm not a threat and that I 'm here to help . - Bring me my truncheon . - How very Kree . He needs a weapon to make a point . My truncheon can restore her memory . Would that not be a-a gesture of my noble intentions ? I 'll consider it once we know that thing does what you say it does . - Do you have a name ? - Vin-tak . And I will earn your trust . Simmons left you with truncheon duty ? Funny word ... " truncheon . " She wanted to take more precautions before investigating it , but I figured , hell , there 's certainly more to it than meets the eye . Been saying the same about you for years . Supposedly , the Kree used this to wipe Lady Sif 's memory . There 's a dial on the bottom , but none of our equipment can detect any electrical or spectrographic signals . Is that your fancy way of saying you don 't know how to turn it on ? Or if it can . Well , I know something else we could try turning on . Hey , careful with that . You don 't want to erase my hard drive , do you ? Like I said , it doesn 't seem to be working . All right , then ... well , maybe I can help you with it . The sooner we get it done , the sooner we ... How are you gonna help me ? Can I just get a little space , please ? - Ah . There she is . - I need time figuring this out . - Well , it seems like you already have . - Not at all . I just think that we ... should slow things down a little bit . Yeah , okay , I get it . Just a bit of fun , yeah ? Though , usually , things get a little more heated before you turn frosty . Okay , sweetheart . Consider it slowed . - Don 't die out there , yeah ? - Hey , Hunter . It 's possible that only he can operate it . We 've seen other alien materials react to biology or DNA . - Don 't remind me . - Or me . We 've all been there , done that . Fitz and Simmons will examine the case . If this guy 's telling the truth , we might finally get the answers we 've been searching for . - Tell us how the truncheon works , Kree . - The Kree has a name . - And that only works when in my hand . - Hmm . That 's convenient . It has a-a dial on the bottom . Hey ! Oh . Sorry . The argument was going nowhere . - You back with us ? - Yes . My memories have returned . I am Lady Sif of Asgard , friend of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Ohh ! Asgardian ... well , that explains a lot . It is true . We do not trust Kree . That is why I am here . When Heimdall saw that one landed on your world , - Odin charged me with retrieving him . - So you came to pick a fight . We know enough about Kree history to be concerned . Well , then , if you know Kree history , perhaps you 've heard the tale of Terrigenesis . Of course . Ancient Kree descending on planets , altering the inhabitants to fight their war . And Earth was one of them . Blue angels who fell from the sky . Eons ago , the Kree waged a very long war . The casualties were high , and they needed more soldiers . - You mean cannon fodder . - We needed killers . One vicious faction among the Kree genetically modified other creatures ' DNA . These modifications can be activated with Terrigen crystals . We know these torturous experiments failed . Not on Earth . Here , we had to shut them down . This faction had built a city . They brought with them the Diviners , which hold the crystals . Their plans were discovered and thwarted by the better of my kind , putting an end to that dark chapter of our past . Until now . When I saw that an ancient signal had been triggered , I knew it had to be a Diviner . If the Kree empire learned that these experiments were a success , they would be likely to renew them . Why did you come here ? These transformed beings are ... abominations . I knew that I had to find the remainder of the Diviners before another monstrosity occurred , and erase any knowledge of it . How many Diviners are supposed to be in that crate ? Enough to create an army . Sir , the crate is empty . My worst fear has come true . We have to assume they were all taken - at the same time back in the ' 40s . - Does that mean Hydra has them ? And if Hydra doesn 't , who does ? Fitz , what is this ? Oh ! Uh ... uh , that 's ... nothing . - It 's just a ... - It 's remarkable . Extra macromolecules just like in Raina 's blood but ... different ones . Whose DNA is this ? It 's , uh ... it 's , uh ... a simulation that I created ... or a-a theory of , uh ... A simulation ? Fitz , this is uncanny ! - Can I have it back , please ? - The precision , the detail ... it reads as real . Yeah , but it 's just a simulation . We must find the remaining Diviners , as well as anyone who 's transformed . We drowned the temple where the Diviners were activated , so that 's a plus . And we do know the woman who was changed . So , someone was transformed . A Kree slave warrior created . Have you put it down ? - No . She disappeared . - What do you know of her ? We don 't know much about Raina 's transformation . Skye witnessed it but didn 't see much . You were there ? - What did you see ? - I-I didn 't ... I mean , n-nothing . Were there others with you ? The changes may not be on the surface ... but buried inside . You must understand , these creatures are weapons ... abominations ... even if they don 't know it . Another one ? Son of Coul , what is this ? Skye you want to talk to us ? Skye , what 's doing this ? I am . Don 't ! Hand her over . I will take her to Asgard . - It will be safer for all of you . - We will do no such thing . The weapon has been activated . It needs to be eliminated before it hurts someone . Skye is not a weapon . Coulson , no one is saying Skye chose this , - but she is dangerous . - I don 't want to be this way . Imagine what will happen if your powers grow . It may not stop at breaking glass . You could bring down buildings , tear continents apart ... I can get a handle on it . That 's not what you were designed for . You were designed to destroy , which is why you must be put down . Yeah , well , that sounds an awful lot like killing to me . - This is not your concern ... - Skye , let 's go . Fitz , we need bambino ! You want her , you go through me ! - W-What 's going on ? - Jemma , I 'm so sorry . You knew . Uh , Lady Sif and the Kree are trying to take Skye away . Sif , you 've got your memory back . You know we 're friends . Consider what you 're doing . This is for the protection of your people . Enough ! Your friend Skye is an atrocity , and I must go put an end to this . We 'll decide what she is . But for now , you 're not going anywhere . - This is not your fight . - It kind of is now . Maybe we should call in some real backup . This is twice now , you and me . - You must really love fighting . - Love fighting ? No . But you 're coming after one of my people , so I 'm willing to fight . That 's noble . Stupid ... but noble . Okay . Listen to me ... just me . We can do this . You can do this . I can 't ... I can 't make it stop . You will control your emotions , just like we practiced . I can 't make it stop . Everyone is at risk . Just focus . Skye , look at me . Focus . It 'll stop . Agent May , release the girl ! You knew you couldn 't stop me . So what was the point ? Just wanted the attention . May , she 'll get through . Ignore it . Remember ... focus ! I can 't . Skye . She harmed herself ! Even though she knew it meant giving up her freedom . All to save the rest of you . Don 't you see ? She wants to get better . If you take her away from the people she loves , she 'll only get worse . I know you think I overreacted . But this decision ... leaving Skye with you ... it carries real danger . I want you to understand that . I do . But we 'll help her through it . Have we arrived yet ? This ... does not seem familiar . No , this is not your home planet . Lady Sif will take you from here . I apologize for my forgetfulness . You have been very kind . Why is my hand not blue ? You are in disguise from the people pursuing you . Remember ? Right . I will keep watch . I 'll return him to his home planet , Hala . He 'll remember none of this . No more trouble should come from there . - But here ... - Yes . There are other Diviners . But we flooded the city so no one can activate them . - We 'll take every precaution . - Coulson ... your people make decisions based on logic . - Usually . - Usually . As do mine . Leaving Skye with us is the logical choice , I promise . No . No , that is not what I mean . Asgard is millennia beyond you in our pursuit of science , of knowledge , and we have learned there are some things that can never be understood . Is this little talk one of them ? I know you wish to affect the outcome , but it may be ... it may be beyond that . Are you talking about fate ? I am saying there are tides in the universe that you cannot swim against . Best of luck , Son of Coul . Thank you . Heimdall , open the Bifrost . Not a lot of laughs , that one . And when I say that about somebody ... You agree with her . You think Skye 's more than we can handle . Look , most of the time , I believe what I see . - You know that , but ... - " But " ... you died . You were brought back ... with a map to a city encoded in your DNA . Our team 's first mission ? - We picked up Skye . - Last week , we took her to that city . I can 't help but remember what Lumley said . - Wherever Skye goes ... - Death follows . Jemma ... um ... I know you feel that I could have been , uh ... - a bit more forthright ... - " Forthright . " Fitz , as understatements go , I think that qualifies as an instant classic . - You lied to me . - Okay . So now we 're even . Can you blame me , the way you were going on about Raina , that she 's a-a-a plague to be eradicated ? I ... Skye is my friend ! She 's different . Oh , yeah . Like I was your friend , and then I changed . How did you handle that ? Uh , t-the point is , secrets don 't help any of us . Skye should have just come clean . What , and risk being locked up , studied , or who knows what else ? - No , I wouldn 't let her . - Oh , you wouldn 't let her . We could have handled her in a way that would have kept everyone safe . It wasn 't fair to us , Fitz . We had a right to know . A right to know . What ... is that the same way that Sif and the Kree had a right to know ? I think this situation 's a little bit different , mate . No , you would have done to her exactly - what they wanted to . - You don 't know that ! Yes , I do know that ! They would ... you would ... you 'd " handle her " ! Mack just said it ! Like , uh ... like Skye 's something to be locked away in a cage somewhere . - We should be protecting her . - No , Fitz ! We 're the ones that need protection from her . S ... Skye . We 'll return in a moment . - Let 's talk . - Hey , what 's going on ? You and Bobbi ... what 's up ? I-I don 't know what you 're talking ... No , I know you 're keeping something from me . I don 't know what it is , but here 's what I do know . I know about the flash drive . I know Coulson doesn 't know about it , but I bet he 'd like to . I know there 's no support group . - Hunter , listen . It 's ... - No , Mack , don 't . Who 's " backup " ? Bobbi mentioned it to you in the hallway . - Who is backup ? - Okay . Well , that 's ... Damn it .

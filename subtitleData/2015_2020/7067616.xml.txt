 Previously on " Stitchers " ... Stinger must be using a digital avatar he created of you as a kid to pull Kirsten deeper into her own mind . Ivy ran the anomaly on us . We know you 've been in touch with Stinger . Are you working for him ? - No ! - You just can 't stop lying . And when we are done , you get to complete the rescue mission you started with your father all those years ago and finally pull your mother out of her endless sleep . You can 't help me if you 're stuck in here . - What kinda dream was it ? - I don 't remember my dreams . Not since I was a little girl . The more intimate you guys are , the more it 's gonna mess with your ability to stitch . How long you gonna keep this up for ? As long as it takes for you to work up a damn oxytocin filter . - Who 's on the other end picking our cases ? - It 's classified . I mean , I could talk to them . I could adjust the way we stitch . Get Kirsten 's mom out of that damn cryogenic tank she 's cooped up in . And where exactly does Kirsten see Jacqueline Stinger cooped up ? - Where 's my mother ? - Your mother is in a secure facility . I 'm going to arrange for you to see her , - but I need a few days . - A few days . - What 's that ? - According to Linus , - a working oxytocin filter . - He did it . - Morning . - Morning . - What you doing ? - Mm . I 'm thinking . - About last night ? - About my mom . Your m ... Come on . It wasn 't that bad , was it ? No . Not at all . I just ... I 'm excited to find out where she is , even more excited to think I might save her . Yeah , and thanks to Linus , we can finally be together . Mm-hmm . You know , I knew being his friend would pay off one day . And he 's a really good friend . He 's the best . Camille ? Shh . I 'm having a beautiful dream I don 't want to wake up from . I need to ask you something . Am I gonna like it ? I don 't know . Okay . Until yesterday , I basically assumed we weren 't gonna work out . What 's her name ? - It 's not like that . - What 's his name ? It 's not like that either . I , um ... I think we should move in together . Wow . You 're not ... You 're not worried it 's too soon to become a U-Haul couple ? I wasn 't until you just said that . I think that 's just about the best thing I 've heard in weeks . Really ? Come over and kiss me , find out . Something is going on . Is it that obvious ? What ? No . I mean , with Maggie . Look . - Admiral Decker . - Wait . That 's the guy you blackmailed to find out where your mom is ? Uh-huh . What the hell is this ? It 's a military escort . Who handles the case briefings ? Um , that 'd be me . Do you know how to use a tablet computer ? Is that a joke ? Be prepared to brief your team on case file Hotel-Mike-Sierra 03-0-600 , in 20 minutes . Cameron . Time to see if Linus 's oxytocin filter really works . Commander Denise Nichols , 84 years old . An American hero . Ms. Nichols was a NASA mathematician in the early ' 70s . She worked on a variety of high-level secretive projects . She retired in 1992 and died of natural causes in her home . Why is she here ? Ms. Nichols had a spare room in her home that seems to be ... impregnable . No visible lock . No keypad . Scans indicate the walls are made of metal a foot thick . - Metal ? - On all six sides . Walls , ceiling and floor . It 's a metal box . I mean , it could be a Faraday cage . Electromagnetic shield ? Something in there she wants to protect . Admiral Decker . Who was Denise Nichols ? Denise Nichols picked the stitch cases . She 's here because we have to find out how she did it . The answer is in that room . Um , are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? Um , my mind is going a thousand miles a minute . The secret to how our cases are picked might actually be right in front of us , right now . Yes , uh , actually , I was going with the " I really hope this oxytocin filter works " flavor of excitement , but , um ... Are you sorry that we , you know ? God ... No . No , no , no . Trust me , no . But this might be the biggest stitch we 've ever stitched . - It 's gonna be fine . - Okay . From your lips to the quantum computer 's ears . - What do you want , Ivy ? - Do you still hate me ? - Very much . - I ... need to see you . - That 's not gonna happen . - Please . One last time . Okay . I 'll come by when I can . Lights at 20 percent , please . I need a go , no-go for stitch neurosync . - Life Sci ? - Go . - Sub Bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . - Comm check . One , two , one , two . - I hear you . Okay . Mission clock set to five minutes , please . Let 's pay a visit to the oracle . Induce stitch neurosync on my mark . In three , two , one . Mark . - Um ... - Um , what ? It 's foggy . I 'm seeing an elevated oxytocin level . - Oxytocin ? - Cameron ? Linus , I thought you told me you had this fixed . Brain volume shrinks with age . I didn 't calculate for that . Why are Kirsten 's oxytocin levels spiking ? Maybe Ms. Nichols had a hot date . She 's 84 years old . Sounds like my kind of woman . Linus , can you crank the oxytocin filter ? Turning it up to 11 as we speak . Try now . It 's still not great . I think I 've mapped the memory of the bedroom / Faraday box room . Okay , stand by , Kirsten . We 're moving you to outside the bedroom . Okay , um ... at the door . It 's , uh , metal . No visible lock . No keypad . Open hailing frequencies . Voice command , acknowledged . The door is voice-activated . It responds to " Open hailing frequencies . " Star Trek , original series . - And the movie . - And that reboot . We know what phrase she used . But it only responds to her voice . Miss Clark 's got to go inside . Okay , Nyota , we 're moving ya . I 'm in . But this fogginess is really intense . I can 't see . Cameron , get this under control now . I am trying . Linus , come on , man . Work with me . She 's reading an e-mail . I 'm gonna need deets on those e-mails , K. Uh , okay , um ... " Relative location of asset . 18 , 23 , 7 , 91 . " Asset ? Who 'd she get that e-mail from ? I can 't make it out . What ? I 'm bouncing . - You okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . Like hell you are . That stitch was a mess from start to finish . And why did you bounce so quickly ? - I think the problem was ... - I know what the problem was . Her oxytocin levels are through the roof . What were the two of you thinking ? We don 't need your permission to be together . And besides , Linus worked up an oxytocin filter . Which didn 't work because we 've never stitched into a subject that old before . You risked everything that you worked for . - You risked saving your mother . - It doesn 't matter anymore ! The e-mail I saw Denise reading was about terminating my mother . That is not going to happen . I saw the e-mail . Why should I believe you ? Because it 's me telling you it 's not going to happen . That is all I can say about this . Now what we need to do is wait out the refractory period , and then try to stitch into Denise again . Do you believe her ? I don 't know what to believe . But there is something else . The numbers that I saw in the stitch , they were about the location of the asset . They have to do with where my mother is . Well , did you see anything that could explain how she picked the stitch cases ? No . It was too foggy , but she has data printouts in that room . I have to get in there and take a closer look . How ? Decker said that the door 's only keyed to Denise Nichols 's voice . Maybe I missed something , something that I 'll remember if I 'm there . Okay . Go with Fisher . I 'll try and smooth things over with Maggie , but , hey . Look , in no way am I sorry about what happened between us last night . I hope you 're not either , okay ? It 's here . Yeah . Okay . No lock . No keypad . No hidden mechanisms I can see . Yeah , I don 't see anything familiar . What was that phrase she used ? Open hailing frequencies . Access denied . Maybe I wrote it down wrong . No . It 's voice recognition . It only works when Denise says " Open hailing frequencies . " Voice command acknowledged . Okay . Denise must have programmed the door to recognize not only her vocal pattern , but also mine . It 's like she knew I 'd come here . Well , she picked our cases , so , clearly , she knew a lot . Look at this little nugget of history , huh ? Wait . I 've seen these before , from an old case . These are the algorithms for stitching . Anything in there about how she picked our cases ? No . Just arrays of numbers I can 't understand . But I know someone who might . So , what do you think ? Is that them ? It 's definitely them . They seem to indicate an exchange of data . Either she was tracking Kirsten during stitches or ... Or maybe she was tracking my progress mapping the brain . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but if she was tracking how much brain we still needed to map , wouldn 't that just be how she chose the cases ? Maybe . But we would need something more powerful than a quantum computer to narrow down potential cases to the exact case Kirsten 's mind needed next . I-I gotta go . But , uh , you can I , we can work on this later . - Um ... - Thanks . - Uh , do you have a minute ? - Yeah . Of course , what 's up ? So , um ... I just want to let you know , I 'm gonna be moving out . Wait . What ? - You 're leaving ? - Not LA . Just the house . Amanda and I are ... are moving in together . But you barely know her . Well , I 'm not gonna know her any better not living with her . Are you sure this isn 't gonna be a mistake ? What if Cameron asked you to live with him and I said you were making a mistake ? I would say you 're being a concerned friend . And I appreciate that you care . I do . But I need this . I 'll miss you . I think you 'll be okay . I came . Now what ? Please ... come in . No . That 's okay . I 'm fine right here . Linus . Please . Is crying on command something you got from your father , or is that a trick you learned on your own ? What I feel is not a game . It isn 't a lie . I know that you don 't understand everything that 's happening right now , but you will . And soon . Please . I need a friend right now . You know , I 'm all alone ! My father found out the NSA 's planning to terminate Jacqueline Stinger . What ? He 's going crazy trying to find her before they kill her . Wait , how did you find this out ? I used your NSA account to hack into Maggie 's e-mails . - No , Linus , I ... - Stop ! Just stop . Never call me again , - and never speak to me again . - Linus . Thanks . - How you holding up ? - These still make no sense ! I thought they would lead to my mom , but now , I don 't know . Are they ... I don 't know , map coordinates ? No . I 've tried every possible combination . Unless the NSA moved my mother to Paris , or Beijing , or Botswana , then no . - Botswana ? - Yeah . I 'm totally done with Ivy . Sorry . I-I didn 't see you there . Don 't worry about it . I 'm done with her too . Listen , Kirsten ... Ivy stole my credentials and hacked into Maggie 's computer . She shared some e-mails with your father . The NSA 's gonna kill your mother . I saw that same e-mail in the stitch . Okay . Maggie said it wasn 't gonna happen , but ... Well , Maggie speaks the language of CIA spooks , aka , lies . But ... every government agency has its own language . And before she worked for the NSA , Denise Nichols was an engineer at NASA . What would a mathematician , like Denise , do at NASA in the 1970s ? She calculated trajectories . I don 't think the NSA is gonna send your mom into space . But they did move her . From Point A , where we know she used to be , to Point B. So you think these numbers track where your mom got moved ? We may not know how she picked the stitch cases , but I think Denise Nichols gave us a way to find my mom . Okay . Okay , that 's something . Linus , take these algorithms back to the lab . See what you can find out about ' em . What are you guys gonna do ? Plot a trajectory . Yes . This is Point B. I didn 't say anything . I can tell what you 're thinking . Oh , that 's a scary superpower in a girlfriend . Okay , so , here 's the plan . We 'll just drive up . We 'll tell them that ... you 're pregnant . You 're going into labor . We need to go inside , and use the phone to call the doctor . Oh ! Excellent plan . If that was even remotely plausible . Okay . Yeah , of course . What was I thinking ? We should just tell them that we work for a secret branch of the NSA and that we hack into the memories of the dead . You love telling people that . Good afternoon , Officer . My um ... wife here is with child . Kirsten Clark ? Yes . Commander Nichols said you 'd be coming . Wait . Denise Nichols ? Pull through the gate . Take any open spot . That works too . What is this place ? From the looks of it , an old munitions factory . Mom . It kills me to see her like this . Dr. Goodkin . Last time I saw you , you were just a little boy . I 'm glad you could be here for our family reunion . You 're not my family . Well , it 's not just me , sweetheart . There 's your mother , and ... of course , your sister . You are such a bitch . Ivy helped me find your mother , and with your help , we can bring her back . We can finish that mission we started when you were a little girl . I can 't believe you came here with him . - It 's okay . - It 's okay ? I didn 't come here alone . Don 't move , Daniel ! You set me up ? I told you to stay away from me . You created this story , that Jacqueline would be terminated to bring me out of hiding ? So , my mom , she 's okay ? She 's fine . Cuff him . Gladly . Kirsten ! No ! Kirsten ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! - Stop ! - Okay , stop ! Don 't shoot ! I give up . - What the hell were you thinking ? - Oh , my God ! Kirsten . Life support 's failing . Can it be fixed ? I don 't know . She 's gonna die . I didn 't come all this way to lose her now . She looks exactly the way she did when we started on the Stitchers program all those years ago . She 's so young . She 's beautiful . Jacqueline 's brain function is low but nominal . So ? Can I stitch into her ? Stitching broke her . Maybe stitching can fix her . Your mother is alive , but with the brain function of someone who 's been in stasis condition for years . There 's no user manual for this one . I-I stitched into Cameron , and he was still alive . He was clinically dead . We 're in a new world here . Can I stitch into her or not ? Yes . I ... Your oxytocin levels are off the chart right now . I mean , you are basically in the worst possible condition you could be in to stitch . Well , either I stitch now and try to save her , or I do nothing and watch her die . What choice do I have ? I 'll push the oxytocin filter as far as it can go and then some . Okay . - Thank you . - Don 't . Kirsten , you 've got no choice , but I 've got no margin for error . If I send you down the wrong neural pathway , it could shut down her brain activity forever . We 've really only got one shot to get this right . Okay . Cameron ... you 've never stitched into a living person before , but there is someone who has . My father . No . No , I 'm sorry . The last time Stinger stitched you into your mother it put her in a coma , you almost died , and it left you with temporal dysplasia . That 's why you need him , so you don 't make his same mistakes . I am not letting him anywhere near this . Come on , please . He might know a few tricks . That 's what I 'm afraid of . I 'm so sorry for everything I put you through . Just as you and I were starting to get close , I had to push you away ... because of my father . And to keep you safe , I couldn 't be honest with you . I just hope , one day , you 'll be able to fully forgive me . How about over dinner sometime ? - I would like that . - Me , too . I gotta go . Admiral Decker wants to debrief me . Okay . Don 't let anything happen to my sister . Hello , Kirsten . Give us a moment . I know you hate me . Hate you ? Do you know how many lives you 've ruined ? Just listen to me for a minute . I can listen to you . I just can 't trust anything you say . And that 's exactly why I reached out to you through the avatar of young Cameron . So you would trust me the way you trust him . Cameron and I have a plan to save Mom . - But ... - But you 've never stitched into a live brain before , - and Cameron 's afraid to do it . - He 's not afraid . He 's cautious . Mom could die . And that 's why you should let me pilot the stitch . Nope . Cameron needs to be on the controls . If anything , your role would be purely advisory . That 's less desirable . I thought you 'd do anything to save Mom . I guess I was wrong . Wait a minute . If you let me direct the stitch , I don 't have a problem with Cameron being on the controls ... as long as he does everything I say . I won 't let your mother die . Okay . But if this is a set-up ... I will kill you myself . That 's my girl . Stinger 's in . He 'll do it . Swell . On one condition . You pilot , he calls the stitch . No . No conditions . He 's lucky to even be in our lab . Please , Cameron . Please , work with him . Okay . Thank you . I 'll go get changed . You know , he won 't let my mother die . I know it . She 's not the one I 'm worried about . See you soon , Mom . You ready ? She looks like Sleeping Beauty . Here comes Prince Charmless . Impressive . It 's exciting to see where you 've taken my work . Oh , this stopped being your work a long time ago . You 're in my lab now . In here , you 're an outsider . It 's the story of my life . Let 's bring her home , hmm ? You sure you can handle this ? Just keep eyes on Stinger . Yep . I swear , you try and pull anything ... Yeah . I know . You 'll kill me . No . He will . Lights to 20 percent , please . I need a go , no-go for stitch neurosync . - Life Sci ? - Go . Sub Bio . Sub Bio ? I 'm seeing something strange here . It 's a structure of some kind , like a ... like a mass near her brain stem . What kind of mass ? Is it a tumor ? No , it seems bio-mechanical . Like a ... hybrid structure of some kind . Let me see . - It 's fine . - You sure ? I said it 's fine . Cameron , we don 't have time to argue about this . Okay , let 's continue . - Sub Bio ? - Under protest . Go . - Noted . Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . Comm check . One , two , one , two . Go . Okay , induce stitch neurosync on my mark . In three , two , one . Mark . I can 't see much . Communications , report . I can 't get a lock on neurosync . Jacqueline 's mind 's rejecting the sync . - Let 's get her out of there . - Kirsten , make the bounce . - Hey , you okay ? - Fine . How 's my mom ? No significant changes . She 's stable but transitioning . - Then let 's try again . - Kirsten , we couldn 't sync up . Let 's try again . I don 't think we should . We couldn 't ... We have no other choice . It 's backwards . What ? The host and the client are inverted . We need to switch ' em . Are you insane ? Maybe ... but I 'm also right . What is he talking about ? He wants to put Jacqueline in the tank and Kirsten in the corpse cassette . - No way . - And why not ? Because we don 't know what being in the corpse cassette will do to her . Or don 't you care ? Jacqueline 's always been your first priority . Never Kirsten . Never Ivy . You 're not thinking scientifically . Scientifically ? You want science ? That 's called physics . You son of a bitch . Come on . Come on ! Come here , come here ! Stop it ! - How 's that feel ? - Want some more , huh ? I 'm asking how it felt when you channeled all that emotional energy towards me , and then I redirected it back to you ? Oh , my God . He 's right . What do you mean ? You and your mom are both still alive . This stitch isn 't about the tech . It 's about ... It 's about the emotional energy . If we put your mother in the tank , and stitch her into you , whatever residual emotional energy she has left will be ... will be fired into your brain and redirected back at her , so that means ... That means all that love that you 've been carrying around for her for all these years ... with one emotional burst of energy , we could wake her up . No . It 's too risky to try . It 's too risky not to . - You sure you want to do this ? - Yes . Hey . Don 't . Don 't look at me like that . - Like what ? - Like this is goodbye . Come on . - Seal me in . - You sure ? Yes . Okay . I love you . I know . Well played . - You 'll be on an open channel . - Mm-hmm . You 'll be able to hear everything that 's going on , okay ? - You won 't be alone . - Okay . Good . I 'll see you soon . If Kirsten 's love is gonna save her mother , then your love is gonna save her . Lights to 20 percent , please . Mission clock is running . I need a go , no-go for stitch neurosync . - Life Sci ? - Go . - Sub Bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . Okay , people , induce stitch neurosync on my mark . In three , two , one . Mark . My head , my head . My head feels like it 's exploding . I 'm seeing vasodilation in the cranial blood vessels . Cassette 's rejecting her . Her body temp 's too high . We have to lower the temp inside the cassette as if there 's a corpse in there . I hate to say this , but he 's right . Do it . Do it . It 's gonna get cold in there , K. I can take it . I know you can . Just focus on my voice . Brain activity 's back to normal . - Synapses stabilizing . - Linus ? She looks fine , but ... - But what ? - I 'm seeing something here . Very similar to when Jacqueline was in there . What are you seeing ? Alex , zoom in on Kirsten 's brain stem . Looks normal . Go deeper . Cameron , is that the same thing that 's on Jacqueline 's brain stem ? I don 't know . My mother said she saw some sort of a reflection in Kirsten 's scan . But not a reflection . It 's a cluster of nanobots that I infused into her brain when I tried to stitch her into her mother as a child . - Oh , my God . - You did this to your own daughter ? It 's how the technology worked back then . That 's why she can 't remember her own dreams . Cameron ? What 's going on ? It 's connected . You , your mother , Denise Nichols . - You 're all connected . - What ? It all makes sense . The algorithm that Denise 's computer used to pick the stitch cases is tuned to Kirsten 's brain and the mapping we accomplished . The computer would get LAPD homicide reports and then narrow all those crimes down to a few candidates for stitching . So , how did Denise pick each specific case ? She didn 't . Kirsten did . The data arrays that Kirsten found at Denise 's ... they show an exchange of data , not in one way , but in both ways . To and from the nanobot cluster in Kirsten 's brain . Without knowing it , I ... selected the exact right case based on the potential benefit to my mind mapping . We said crunching the data would require more power than a quantum computer . The human brain is the most powerful computer of all . Jacqueline has a similar structure in her brain . Quantum entanglement . That means they should be able to communicate on a quantum level . " You can 't help me if you 're stuck in here . " That ... that was my mother talking to me . When we stitch again , we just have to reopen that channel . Great . So what are we waiting for ? Okay , just hold on , Kirsten . Reopening that channel . In three , two , one . Mark . Kirsten , how you holding up ? Cold . I can 't see anything yet . Okay , Kirsten , listen to me . I need you to focus in on all that love you have . All the love that you have for your mother , your friends , for me . I want you to channel every bit of love and emotion that you 've stored inside of your brain ever since you lost that temporal dysplasia , you hear me ? It 's just you and me , Stretch , okay ? You 're going to channel all of that ... into your mother . I see her . It 's time to come home . Yeah . Jacqueline is ready to bounce . - Cameron ? - Forcing the bounce . Now . Ayo , brain function ! Coming to normal . Jackie . Jackie , sweetheart . You 're gonna be okay . Kirsten . - Kirsten , you did it . - Where am I ? You 're here . Kirsten , you 're safe , okay ? You 're home . I will never leave you . Get Dr. Marian Goodkin down here ASAP . - Right away . - Come here . Come on . Come on , we 're gonna get you checked out . Okay ? Help me get her out of here ! So ? Well , your mother reviewed Kirsten 's EEG . There 's , um ... no sign of a stroke . No traumatic brain injury . What aren 't you telling us ? Kirsten doesn 't remember anything . About what happened to her ? Maybe ... - Maybe that 's a good thing ? - No , that 's not it . Whatever happened to Kirsten while in the corpse cassette affected the latter part of her longterm memory . Now , your mother is gonna run some more tests , but Kirsten 's memories from the last two or three years are compromised . She doesn 't remember anything about the Stitchers program . She doesn 't remember you . But that 's temporary , right ? I don 't know . Excuse me . I 'm sure she 'll get her memory back soon . Just go talk to her . - Be with her . - No , I can 't . Not now . Come on , dude , you got to . No , I don 't have to do anything , man . This is my fault . I 'm not gonna be able to forgive myself for this . You had no choice . Fisher 's right . You did exactly ... No , I had a choice , and this is the choice that I made . Because Kirsten wanted you to . Well , it was my call . I should have said no ! But you didn 't , so don 't beat yourself up over it . I know , but please , just ... leave me alone right now . - Cameron . - Just ! Please . Are you okay ? You seem really , um , upset at those people . Are they your friends ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . I ... don 't remember if we 've met or not . I 'm Kirsten . I 'm Cameron . Something happened to my memory , um ... so , I 'm a little confused . But didn 't we meet before ? When we were kids . You had heart surgery , right ? Yeah . Yeah , that was ... that was me . Yeah . I remember you were really nice to me . How 's your heart ? It hurts a little . You 'll be okay one day . I promise . It was nice talking to you , Kirsten . You too . I will never forgive you for what you 're making me do to him .

 Picked up a Mayday . Looks like a light freighter . Calls itself the Scopuli . We 're obligated to check it out . - It 's pirate bait . - Purge the logs . We never received that signal . I have something for you . Little lost daughter case . So what 's my contract exactly ? Find Julie Mao . If she 's still here on Ceres , detain her and ship her home . Kidnap job . My pleasure . Anybody grew up this far from the sun won 't give a good goddamn what planet you 're from . Real sky over your head and real gravity holding you on the ground , they don 't trust you . That distress call we never received , it was logged with HQ . Holden , you 'll head up this rescue , or salvage . Put a shuttle team together . So , just for the record , guys , I don 't wanna be here right now . This must be the beacon that called us . Forwarding you an A-1 tight beam from the Canterbury . Torpedo launch ! Canterbury , burn like hell , you got incoming . Real lemon works best , if you could ever get your hands on one . It 's a crucial part of the formula . Neutralizes acidity , adds body , balances pH . Something like that . Here . A perfect cup of coffee . - It 's an acquired taste . - Yeah . - So , wait and see . - Yeah . Hey , what 's your name ? Ade . I 'm the new navigator . Jim , there 's something you should know . Hoss . Hoss ! Debris field . Buckle up ! I 'll try to drive us out of it . How bad are we gonna catch it ? Pretty bad . Right , sweetheart . You know how much I love you . Airlock breach ! We 're losing pressure ! Somebody close the hatch ! I 'm on it ! Somebody shut that damn airlock ! Son of a bitch . We 're through . Do we still have scopes ? Damn straight . Do not lose that ship . What ? - Jesus , you 're not ... - We 're going after them . - Buddy , I don 't think ... - We 're losing them ! Don 't do it , Alex . They just dusted 50 of our friends . Well , let 's not make it 55 . Alex , I 'm telling you to go after that ship . What if they don 't like being followed ? They slip off that screen , they 're gone forever . They 'll get away with this . What is wrong with you ? I gave an order ! You think rank matters now ? Get up , I 'll do it myself . Get up ! We 're not going anywhere . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Whoa , whoa ! Let 's just take a deep breath here , people . All of you . Water ration exceeded . Water ration exceeded . They 're trying to thirst us out . - Who 's that ? - Earth , Mars . The water shipment 's not late , copain . They 're holdin ' it back . You seem pretty sure about that . Water means life . One shipment late , you got protests . Two shipments late , you got dead people in the street . And it 's gonna get worse . Mark my words . Christ . " Father , bother , poured hot coffee in the parking lot . " " Father , bother , poured hot coffee in the parking lot . " Home . I 'm home . Show me my files . Copy all files . Replay my last messages . I tried to give you the best of all worlds , and you choose to live like some filthy handmaid among the riff-raff of the Solar System . Since you have no intention of returning home , I 'm forced to consider selling The Razorback . You 're naive , sweetheart . It 's time to come home . Please . I 'll make everything right again . Jesus . Spare me . Show me my replies . You 're so blind and so condescending and you 're never gonna change . If you won 't take yourself seriously as an adult , then why should I care about being your child ? You want to sell The Razorback ? Do it . You can 't buy me off or control me anymore . Maybe what you hate about me the most is that I remind you of yourself . Keep it up , partner . You 'll get there . _ Is it true that you had a Belter up on hooks for 20 hours ? He 's an O.P.A. smuggler and a terrorist . The Secretary-General ... He didn 't want to talk ... The Secretary-General has publicly disavowed gravity torture . If you want to talk to that Belter , you put him in the tank . You know who I am ? I 've heard of you , yes . Many interesting tales . You 're well-spoken for an O.P.A. soldier . Because I 'm a Belter , I 'm naturally O.P.A. ? I 'm just a citizen of the Belt . I work for the future of my people as you do for yours . Then for the future of both our people , I need to know how you got your hands on restricted stealth technology that could destroy the balance in the system . You mean the balance between Earth and Mars . Either way , it 's a lousy deal for Belters . The O.P.A. demands legitimacy through violence . They haven 't earned it any other way . No ? You talk to me through a piece of glass , you see my body which can no longer survive on the very planet that bore my great-grandmother . Earth has created a race of exiles out in space , who have no homes to return to . Should this go unanswered ? I don 't mean to make you afraid , madame . Have I given you the impression that I 'm afraid ? Then why waste your time on a meaningless courier like myself ? You 're too modest , child . Someone entrusted you to transport pieces of the holy grail . The question is , who ? There are places far worse than this . And I imagine there is a mother somewhere who 'll love to see her boy again . Est cela ça , madame . I understand . We all have our duty . _ We 've got a dead radio and about four hours of oxygen left . Alex , how much burn do we have ? I could get us maybe a third of the way to Ganymede Station , maybe . Or get us right to the edge of the shipping lanes , and then we 'd have to pray someone tripped over us . It won 't happen . With a dead transponder , we 're just like space trash . What 's wrong with the radio ? Board 's cooked , and I 'm guessing the antenna array up top has seen better days . See if you can improvise another board . I 'm gonna go outside and see what 's what . Great . We 'll wait here . I don 't mean to be a bad news bull or anything , but the airlock 's done . The outer door 's gone . Then we 'll have to vent the ship . Are you outta your tree ? We 'll lose all oxygen in the cabin . Everything depends on fixing that radio . We 're wasting time . There you go . Calling the shots again . I 'm going outside . You got a problem with that ? Amos , go with him . Whoa ! Let 's just hold on for one second . We don 't have to go outside . We 're safe right now . We open those doors , we 're done . The ship could crack apart . I 'm telling you ... - Shed ? - I 'm just ... If we open those doors ... Please , just listen to me . Listen to me ! If we out there , we 're gonna die . Hey , hey , hey ! You 're in shock . You 're in shock . You know the symptoms . You know the symptoms . Just breathe . Breathe . Deep ... breathe . Breathe , breathe . All right . There . There . You chilled ? Okay . Now , we 're gonna go outside , and we 're gonna fix the antenna , and we 're gonna make some noise and get rescued . Okay . Okay ? Yeah . Watch your step , boys . We 're on the way . How 's it looking out there ? Well , it could 've been worse . It can always be worse . Okay . It 's worse . Captain was pissed you weren 't around . She wanted this dealt with . Yeah , it must be my week . New Earth partner . Drawing all the " hot " cases ... Your attention , please . The Air , Water and Power ... Well , it 's about time . Expected you an hour ago . It 's a long hoof from the Medina , sir . A week ago , those dead patches started appearing . My guess is , the Greigas are stealing water again . Some Belters clearly don 't respect the green space 's role in recycling the air and the water . Not to mention the embarrassment it causes the Governor . You seem sure it was Belters . The criminals here tend to be . You 're new here , aren 't you ? We 'll get right on that , sir . Maybe if everyone in Ceres had this view , they 'd respect you more . There . Now , you can make your own view . Oh , shit ! You 're an Earther . And I don 't even know where you 're from . We 're gonna be space trash in a few hours and you wanna start a friendship ? If you don 't think we 're gonna make it , what are you doing up here ? Naomi told me to , so I am . As far as I 'm concerned , she 's the cap now . ♪ Till I lost my Clementine ♪ Alex , send me some juice to E-12 . - ♪ How I missed her ... ♪ - Alex ? Alex ! Oh . E-12 . Copy that . There you go , sugar . You doin ' okay up there ? I 'm doing as good as dew on a mornin ' full of sunshine . Hey , what 's the deal with you and Naomi ? You two an item or something ? An item ? Hey , it 's none of my business , but ... You must think I 'm pretty stupid , don 't you ? I mean , you 're right . I can take a core apart and put it back together with my eyes closed . But ask me whether or not I should rip your helmet off and kick you off this bucket , and I couldn 't give you a reason why I should or shouldn 't . Except Naomi wouldn 't like it . Could you pass me the drill ? Thank you . ♪ Then I lost my Clementine ♪ Alex , what are you doing ? I 'm bringin ' her home , honey-pie . - Hey . - One more , two ... and we 'll be together . Just one trip to Ganymede , sweetheart . Oh , don 't be like that , sugar , I said I 'm comin ' home . - Alex . - Shed , what 's wrong with him ? He 's ... he 's hypoxic . Oh , shit ! His breather 's crapping out ! Damn it ! How long can he hold on ? Oh , oh , shit . We 're losin ' him ! We 're coming back in . Negative . We don 't have enough oxygen to vent again . Shed , take care of him ! Do something ! We 're in a vacuum ! He 's in a suit ! I ... What do you want me to do ? There 's no spare ! Shed , you 're a medic ! Act like one ! Hold on , buddy . Listen , I 'm hooking our breathers up , okay ? So we can share air . So you can breathe off mine , okay ? Shed , what 's happening ? Okay . Hold on , buddy . Come on . Hold on , Alex ! Come on . Yeah , there it is ! Breathe ! Breathe , Alex ! Breathe it in . Breathe . Just keep breathing . We 're buddy-breathing . It 's all gonna be good . It 's all good . Shed , you got this ? No one else dies today . If we don 't get that radio back , we all die ... today . Okay , Alex . My turn , buddy . I just need a couple of breaths . Ah , that 's the stuff . How 's Alex doing ? He 's hanging in there . What does that mean ? Means he 's hanging in there ! Get on with it . Hurry up . Don 't look at it . Just think about something else , okay ? Like your kid . Think about your kid . Swinging on a ... Swinging on a swing or something . You 're trying to distract me . Hey , guys . We 're running out of ... we 're running out of air . Now ? No carrier . Ah , piece of shit ! We have connection . Get back in here now ! Come on . - Go ! - Pressurizing . What the hell did you do to me ? You saved my hide , partner . You crazy son of a bitch . Ah , no problem . I need him sent to Luna for deeper interrogations . Let the team here go another round , they 'll break him . They have a budget , it 's already shot to hell . And unlike you , I have to grovel and promise and deliver to get reappointed . This concerns me ? How ? You 're two heartbeats away from running the government on this planet . Yet you 're accountable to no one . How does that happen ? This boy isn 't some hapless smuggler . I believe the O.P.A may be trying to obtain stealth weapons . Everything is not an O.P.A. plot and if Earth can 't afford a stealth program , how can a bunch of rock-tossers ? They can 't ... Unless they 've found a new friend like Mars . Cold war is a bloodless war . Mutual distrust and complete co-dependence . Nobody wants to change that . Least of all Mars . That 's another thing . I want every Martian weapons facility under a microscope . They are . You know , your Belter will like gravity on Luna better . That 's the only thing he 'll like . I 'm afraid for him . Heaven help your enemies , Chrisjen . Heaven help us all if Mars and the Belt decide to share a toothbrush . Bold move , I 'll give him that . What ? The cold war is over , this is something new . The antenna 's working but our signal 's still too weak . The transmitter was severed from the power grid . It 's done . This just keeps getting better and better . So we just blew an hour of air for a radio that doesn 't even work ? Can 't we rig ourselves an amplifier ? We 're gonna need a shit load of power . Take everything apart . Be fast and be careful , we 're inside of a limb with a pin here . If it has a battery , a power pack , any charge capability , it goes into a part . I 'm sorry , does anyone need a back rub first ? Last one . Even if someone hears our SOS , they 're gonna think we 're pirates . Well ... We 're gonna just have to pray there 's another caring soul out there like Ade . Ade ? She 's why we 're in this shit right now . If she hadn 't gone and logged that stupid distress call ... Hey ! You don 't know what you are talking about . You wanna keep your teeth in your mouth ... We 're wasting air . Give me a hand over here , will you , buddy ? You want to unburden your soul , do it on your own time . On the remotest chance we get off this alive . We have enough problems right now . Yes , sir . You know that guy was telling you to go hump yourself . - Yeah . - Geez ... Really ? I hadn 't realized that . I 've got plans for it , anyway . Not even gonna ask . Nice tat . Your boss lets you wear your colors like that , out in the open ? Boss has one just like it . Here 's the one . Feeds the south-east corner of the gardens . - This guy ? - Yeah . Look it , here . Sensor box should be to your right . Amateurs . But you gotta admire their stones for hittin ' the park . Where did you say this pipe diverts to ? Twelfth Level , condenser grid . It 's in a warehouse . Even water like this today , Belter loader gonna want it . Huh ? Hmm ? Sa baka . It 's good ! Good . We can sell it . Let 's make some money ! Star Helix , don 't move ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Be smart . Come on , kid . Huh ? Is that everything you got ? Hey ... Hey ! Doing my work , cop . Hey , whoa , whoa ! What are you punks doing stealing up-tunnel water ? Free sample . All piss and vinegar . You know , you 're lucky it 's us chasing you and not the Greigas . They would feed you your fingers , for playin ' in their district . Greigas gone . This is our turf now . Nobody just abandons their territory to a bunch of street punks . You see , the Greigas were smart . They 'd siphon a little water , and sell it off ... Nobody 's the wiser . But you , you gutter punks . You screwed the golden goose . - Mmm ? - Okay , man . Schoolin ' me on gangsters , que ? Yeah , dirtbag school 's in session . Listen ... Pick all the pockets you want , roll drunks ... But when you mess with the water , that 's when you 're going down . Maybe a couple of years on a prison barge will set him straight . Huh ? Would you like that ? Do what you gotta do . Hey ... Hey ! Get out of here . Stay away from the aqua . Tell all your friends ! I did not see that coming . Yeah ? How about this ? You see that coming ? Yeah . Madam , I apologize for calling so late . There 's been an incident on the shuttle to Luna . Go on . The prisoner , Heikki Sobong took his own life by avoiding the high-gravity injections from his crash couch ... It appears he broke free of his restraints , during the critical phase of the ascent , when he knew the guards would be receiving their own injections . I think , madam , he is making a statement . Speak frankly , please . Earth 's gravity . We used it to hurt him . He threw it back in our face . You want to clue us in ? This beacon we answered isn 't pirate tech ... It 's top-grade military stuff . Serial stamp on the main board . Martian Congressional Navy . That makes no kind of sense . It makes all kinds of sense . That ship that attacked The Cant wasn 't tucked behind an asteroid , it was hiding in plain sight . A stealth ship ... why would they nuke a civilian ship without warning ? Because they can . - You don 't know what you 're talking about . - Whoa ... What the hell are we tangled up in here ? Who gives a shit ? Let 's focus on staying alive . We 'll worry about Mars later . Good so far ? Good signal . We 've got three hours of juice . Well ... I guess all we gotta do now is pop a cold beer , and wait to be rescued . Nope . Got no record of a Razorback on these docks . Any , um , special hangar where rich people keep their pleasure-craft ? On Ceres ? Not last I heard . Now , there 's a girl I 'm not gonna forget anytime soon . Yeah , why 's that ? Few rotations back , some dock-jock was slobbering all over her while she was prepping to ship out . Eh , guy must 've mistaken her good manners for encouragement and when he laid hands on her , god damn , she planted him in the deck . That girl had skills . What ship was that ? Scopuli . Dumpy old transport . No cargo , just this young lady and a few crew . Send me the ship manifest , will you ? And transponder logs , et cetera ? She in some kind of trouble ? I 'm sure it 's nothin ' she can 't handle . Alex ? Someone heard us . - Someone heard us ? - Yeah . Are they coming ? Just waiting for the bounce back . What is that ? Ship en route . How far ? It 's almost 80,000 clicks . It 's gonna be a hell of a close shave . We 'll make it . What ? What is it ? The ship . It 's Mars . What ? The Donnager . The flagship of the Martian Navy . Coming to finish the job . And we just told ' em where we were . ... continues to appear for the raider Canterbury which disappeared while responding to a distress call . The Canterbury was reported to be carrying ice , bound for Ceres station . And the loss of that shipment has prompted a drastic increase in water rationing station-wide . A spokesperson ... - Hey . - Hey . Good golly , Ms. Mao . You sure can pick ' em . Find your lost heiress yet ? Well ... She 's not on Ceres . Shipped out on the Scopuli . It just went dark right after take-off . Vanished . The week for vanishing ships . You 'd think a rich girl like her would 've had that birthmark fixed . I don 't know . If it was a birthmark , her parents would have had it fixed . That 's a scar . I don 't think she wanted it fixed . Why do you say that ? Oh , it 's a badge of defiance . Against everything she 's supposed to be . Wow . She tell you that herself ? Yeah , she did . Listen , we 're the only ones who know what happened to the Cant . We get on that ship and chances are we 're never comin ' out . Unless ... What are you doing ? Buying us insurance . My name is James Holden , speaking for the five survivors of the Canterbury . Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus SOS from a ship called the Scopuli . We recovered a false beacon and identified it as Martian Naval technology . - It was a trap . - Are you insane ? We are about to be taken aboard the MCRN Donnager . - Alex , shut him down ! - He 's locked us out . He 's locked us out ! Hey , whoa , whoa ! You don 't speak for us . We intend to cooperate and hope this means we won 't be harmed . Should I smoke him ? Say the word . We 're dead anyway . Any such action will only confirm that the Canterbury was destroyed by Mars . It just needs to reach one ship , one station . Then it 'll spread . Don 't count on it . Their jammers were in range . You are prisoners of the Mars Congressional Republic . Move and you die .

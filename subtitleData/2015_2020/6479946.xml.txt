We 've got an unidentified contact bearing 270 degrees , 20 miles , speed 600 knots ; appears to be descending fast . You tracking a meteor , Rollins ? Negative , we 've got visual on it , definitely no meteor . Stand by , Rollins . Any ideas there , Jim ? Not sure , I 'm switching to thermal . Well , whatever it is , it 's going down . Damn . What the hell was that ? Whatever it was , it 's down for the count . Rollins Tower ... Albuquerque Center , I 'm getting heavy interference , say again ? Rollins Tower , please confirm ... Phone 's dead , try the radio on a different frequency . Any station , any station , this is Rollins Tower on Victor , anybody read me ? This is crazy . You gotta hear this . What ? I 'm gonna patch it through . Okay , we are rollin ' here on another beautiful Arizona morning . Oh ! Hey , Parker , buddy , I see you 're up at least ! Huh ! Hey , buddy ! Hey , good morning ! I know , buddy . I wish you could come , too . I know , I know , don 't blame me , blame your mom . She 's the one that said there wasn 't enough room in the car . I know , buddy . I call bullshit , too . Here we go ! Morning , sunshines ! Collin ! God ! Already with the camera ? Aw , wake up , guys ! I got a fun weekend planned for us ! Dude , I 'll give you $ 50 if you give us one more hour . No , no can do , brother . Sorry . As John Wayne once said , we 're burning daylight . Let 's do this . - Fucker . - Uh-huh . For a hundred , I might reconsider . - Fine , I 'll write you a check . - No , no , no . Cash money only . Hey , Kimmy . Time to wake up . Morning , baby . Morning , hey . What are you doing ? I 'm watching you . Am I totally creeping you out or what ? Pervert . How long have you been filming me ? I don 't know , 30 , 40 minutes ? Maybe less . - So creepy . - Uh-huh . Hey , someone 's camera-shy . Come on , baby . Give it to me . What ? Whoa , whoa , whoa . - Give it . - Easy . Oh ! See how you like it . Oh ... Now what ? Now that I 've got you where I want you ... Oh , hello . That what you wanna see , you dirty little perv ? You know it . Please . - Give it to me . - No , not the camera . Come on . No , no . Easy , alright . Ah ... Okay . Okay ? - Talk to me . - Talk to you about ? Tell me what you 're thinking . I 'm thinking that I love you . Aww , you 're sweet . And I think you 're beautiful . And ... ? What else ? I think you are the most sexiest woman in the world . Very nice . Keep going . - The most intelligent . - That 's definitely true . Hey , hey . - Hands off the merchandise . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . No ... tease ! Total tease ! Hey . You know I just love making you crazy . Where you going ? What 're you doing ? I gotta pee . Really ? She leaves me to fend for myself again . Morning all ! Well , it is Friday , and for many of you , that means you have a fun and exciting weekend to look forward to , but I am working , and not that I don 't love what I do , but seeing as how it is " Full Disclosure Friday , " I am not really feeling it today . Oh , one cool thing , there was a report of a meteor touching down near Hadly Hill . And for those of you that don 't know Hadly , it 's what we like to call a starter hill . It 's not too challenging of a climb , but it 's a beautiful hike , it 's perfect for those of you that have small children with you . Um , just don 't get hit by any falling meteors . Um , now what some may not know about meteors , is that even though they look really bright and beautiful in the sky , what ends up touching down is usually not that much bigger than an acorn . So it 's kind of uneventful , for the most part , but it 's always fun to investigate . Ah , it 's already cold . That 's not good . And it is later than I thought . God , I hate when that happens . Uh , okay ! This is Alice the park ranger , signing off . As always , leave comments below , click to subscribe to my channel . You guys know the drill . Okay , bye ! Okay , here we are . First stop . Casa de Duncan . Hey , Dunk , what 's up , buddy ? How 're you doing today ? Alrightey . Hope anybody 's home . Hello ? Oh , guess I 'm breaking in . - Hey , Janice , how 're you doing ? - Hey . Where 's the old man ? - Where do you think ? - Alright . See ya later . Later . So , uh , Duncan 's got something he wants to show you all . - You live ? - Locked and loaded . Got something I wanna show you . What 're you gonna show us with that old hunk of junk ? Well , most folks look at this , call it a scope . But after a few of my modifications , it is now known as the Duncan Harvey original . Shameless self-promoter ! You wanna see what it can do ? Yeah ! Why the hell not ? - That 's my mark . - Alright , that ain 't happening , guess it 'd have to be eyes on you . Well ? What , you missed ? - How ' bout them apples ? - Shit ! No shit ! That 's more like ... 500 yards ! With this rig , I could make the same at six . Okay , alright , Duncan , you impressed me . - Damn right . - Well , but now how do I know you didn 't come out here and take that shot an hour ago ? Nah , I made it last night at ten yards , maybe twelve . Yeah , I believe that , I believe that . But seriously , that 's a bullseye at 450 yards . I wish I could take credit , but with this here hand-crafted , and fully patented , Harvey scope , hell , a brain dead stepchild could make that shot . Hey , whoa , man ! What the hell ? Some kind of weird ass bullshit TV ... Okay . So you got the house and gate keys ? I think that should be it . You can call me on the cellular 'til we get to the high country . I got it . It 's no problem . - Guessing we 're all set then . - Daylight 's a burnin ' . Yeah , guess it 's time to shorten the road . See ya Sunday . Hey , bring me back a ten point ! I 'll bring you back two ten points . Alright . Take it easy , Janice . You 're on driving duty , old man . What 'd you say ? Let the immortals ride again . Okay , couldn 't get the exact coordinates on that meteor , but I 'm seeing some smoke up here . Could be a brush fire , and with the little rain fall we 've had this year , that could be bad , really bad , considering how dry everything is . Not sure what 's going on , but I 'm gonna let this run . On my way to check out this meteor , and my radio is doing all kinds of crazy ... At first nothing , but the closer I get to my destination , this weird sound is getting louder . Okay , on foot from here . Okay , here we are down at the old swimming hole , April 2012 . There 's my boy , Ryan , fishing . Hey , Ryan , any biters ? - Not yet . - Know why ? That is a swimming hole ! Not a fishing hole . Yeah , yeah . Whoa . This is where I should be aiming my camera . Say hey to the camera , girls ! - Hey , camera . - Yeah , yeah . You guys not getting into the water or what ? Well , Ryan says we 'll scare off the fishies . I 'm sorry ? What ? I can 't hear you . - What the fuck just landed on me ? ! - Whoa , whoa , hey , now . - Be careful . - " Hey now " is right . - Just lost my PG rating . - That totally freaked me out . It was just a little bug ! There was nothing little about it . If this ends up on YouTube , I 'm gonna kill you . Wimpy , Wimpy , hey , Mr. Skin , maybe , but you know ... - Shut up ! - You two , trust me , trust me . I 'm the filmmaker here . I 've found the source of the smoke , and ... Well , it can 't be what it looks like . Look at the size of this thing . This is ... Holy shit ... What is this growing here ? 322 , come in . What the hello ? Ahh ! Ugh , something just bit me . Okay , that ... really stings . Okay , I 'm out of here . 'Kay , whatever that was ... I-I 've gotta get ahold of Poison Control . Following protocol when you don 't know what bit you , you 're supposed to grab a sample , but I am not touching whatever that was . 322 , come in ! This is Range One calling South Range dispatch . What 's this now ? South Range dispatch ? 322 ? Anyone ? Can anyone read me ? Over . Alright now , we 're doing this thing by camp rules , ain 't we ? You really should know ' em by now , but I 'll repeat ' em for the record . - Let 's hear ' em . - Rule number one ... - Don 't shit where you eat . - That 's right . I catch you pinching logs in my cabin , and it 'll be your head mounted on the wall . Rule number one . When you gotta go , you go outside . And bury your own damn awful . Nobody wants to step in it . - Alright . Rule number two ? - Rule number two . You 're only allowed to eat what you kill . You don 't kill , you go hungry . Simple as that . And , uh , rule number three ? Don 't jerk off where I can see ya . That 's right , Trevor , added that one just for you . Is that camera the heaviest thing you 're gonna lift today ? Alright . Okay , I 've gotta get this recorded . This is not like any bite I 've ever had before . It 's been no more than 30 or or 35 minutes since I was stung by whatever that was . This is really hard to believe . Ugh ! Ugh ... Following procedure to the letter , I 've made several attempts at contacting Poison Control , but low and behold , my radios don 't work . Both in my truck and here at the office , this is what I get . So , I 'm not able to get through to anybody , not Poison Control , not Central station ... No one . To further complicate things , I ... I feel terrible , and I-I can see that I look just as bad as I feel . I 've pretty much done as much as I can here by myself . Simple first aid has been administered , but something tells me that 's not gonna cut it . Last reading was ... 103.6 . That 's not good . Well , that 's ... That 's scary . I am in no ... Excuse me . I am in no condition to operate a vehicle , and it is a ... It is a good , um 2.5 miles of rough terrain to get down the mountain on foot . Uh , all I can think now is to try smoke flairs . And hope that somebody sees them . It 's all I can do . It 's all I can ... Wow , this is bad . Okay . Okay . I 'm gonna have to sign off now . Alright . Just a quick rundown . I 'm totally out here doin the Francis Ford Coppola thing . Got a GoPro Fully High Definition Camera mounted to my head , modded by myself for the true huntsmen , gives me the option of going infrared . Got a second one of these bad boys , it 's filming me talking to you right now . Now , it works for a good backup , but I can also strap it to my chest strap here . It gives a different field of vision . Usually like to shoot 60p , ultra-wide . That guy . Now . This is a truly Trevor original . Hi-Fi scope camera . Best angle for the kill shots to be sure . Trev ! You done playin ' with yourself ? Duncan , grouchy old codger as always . Nah , Dunk , I 'm just waiting for you to come over here and finish me off . Goddamn kids , no respect today . Always bustin ' balls . You ready for this , old man ? Shit , boy , you supposed to be an astronaut ? Laugh now , 20 bucks says I get first kill . - Now you 're dreamin ' . - Camera ain 't gonna lie , buddy . Same can 't be said for you , though . Alright , the game is on , folks . This ... This can 't be real . Range One to South Range dispatch . Anyone with ears on ? Anyone at all hearing me ? If anyone can hear me , this is Alice Sumner , park ranger number f ... 4102 . I 've been infected with some kind of toxin . In need of immediate medical assistance . Anyone ... Please ! Alright , here we are , folks , huh ! Outside camping . How are you , guys ? Huh ? Everybody good ? - Good . - Doing good , buddy . Everybody hanging out by the campfire , yeah . Ahh , we 're just hanging out , you know . Alright , alright , alright , hey , ladies , spread the love to the last true hippie among us here , please . Now that 's what 's up . Pass the pipe . Lookin ' out for you , my man . Wait , wait , wait , that 's not my pipe . Well , yeah , it 's not your smoke either . - This is pure Cali Hydro . - That good ! That good stuff . Hey ! What are you doing in here ? - We 're about to light the fire . - Oh , yeah ? You can light my fire . That 's cheesy , huh ? - You are so stoned . - Yes , I am high . I am , that Cali shit is way better than mine . Wait . Wait , wait . I came in here for something . Yeah , I 'm right here . - Not gonna happen . - What ? Why ? Sorry , no lovin ' for you . Really ? It-It 'll only take a second . Isn 't that the sad truth . - Come here . - No , wait , wait , not here . Why ? We always make love up here . Our friends are right outside . No , they 're probably in their tent doing the same thing that I 'm trying to do . You know ... Hello ! I spilled bong juice all over myself . - You 're so wasted ! - Yeah , and I 'm so hungry ! - Yeah . - Yeah ? This one . Aww ! My baby looks sad . You 're so sexy . - You like ? - Oh , I like ? Are you kidding me ? I love . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Oh , you silly , silly girl . I 'm not about to put on a show for everybody . Oh , modest and virtuous woman . That 's right , so camera off . What the fuck ? This is too weird . Something scared off the whole damn forest . Where 'd Duncan get to ? Okay , so , uh ... I 'm gonna show you somethin ' here . I ... I 've never seen anything like this . What in God 's name did this ? Dunk ? Hey ! Man , what you think this was ? Judging by the size of these rib bones , I 'd say this used to be a 10 to 12 point buck . Probably a two to three hundred pounder . No fucking way , man . Can you believe this ? I 'm seein ' , but I ain 't . Pod thing growing on it ? Holy cow . Uh , just a quick note , I 've been hunting and fishing in these woods all my life . I 've seen hundreds of animal carcasses . I ain 't never seen anything like this . Never . Never even heard of anything like this . I mean , do you know anything that might 've caused this ? No . Too weird . Spooky . Yeah . Trev ? Still out there ? I don 't know , but we 're moving on . Yeah . Thought I 'd flip on here for a minute . Got maybe a couple hours of daylight left , so I 've started to get a move on here 'cause I do not wanna get caught here after dark . Goddammit , it 's been one weird ass day . Hey , Dunk ? Duncan , I think we should head back to the cabin . I don 't get it . Let 's pack it in , man . You hear that ? No , what ? Nothing . Not so much as a bird chirping or a fly buzzin ' . Alright , I really think we should , we should head back . Probably so . It 's getting spooky , man , there 's nothing here . No . - What ? - Something 's here . It 's definitely close . Hey ! Dunk ! - Where you going , man ? - Shit ! What ? Hey , where ... Dunk , come back here , man ! Goddammit ! Jesus Christ ! - Fuck ! - Save me , boy ! Oh , man , what the hell did this to you ? ! You 're crazy , old man , I ain 't goin ' nowhere . Get the hell outta here , Trevor ! Jesus fucking Christ ! Here . Put the pressure on there ! I gotta get you out-a here , buddy , but I can 't risk moving ' ya . Breaker , Breaker , on emergency channel ! Is anybody out there with ears on ? Goddammit . Alright , buddy , here 's the situation , I can 't ... I can 't get anyone on the radio , must be some kind of interference or something . I gotta get to better ground , so you just ... You just sit tight . Goddammit ! Okay , okay . Wait , wait . Okay , now just keep one hand there . Just keep it firm . And keep that hand ... Right there , don 't worry , buddy . Alright , alright , buddy . You just sit tight , I 'll be back . I 'll be back ! Calling on emergency channel ! Breaker , Breaker ! C.H ... . C.H. 9 , in need of immediate medical assistance ! Over . Sorry , folks , we 're having some technical difficulties , but anyhow ... let 's see what people are doing . - Careful with the camera . - I am ! God . Why does he treat me like I 'm retarded ? I know how to do this shit . Okay , maybe not . Fuck it . Hey , Kim ! Collin , your fiancé has , like , a totally rockin ' pair of tits . - Don 't I know it . - Don 't I know it . - Hey , hey , hey ! - Just joking ! Excuse me ? Thanks , but that 's not really true . It is true . Oh , yeah . - Thank God for push-up bras , right ? - My God , such modesty ! - Hey , watch out . - Hey , whoa ! You 're supposed ... You 're supposed to toast the marshmallow ! You 're flaming ' it ! I don 't think there 's exactly a set of rules when it comes to the mellow , right ? Hey , guys , who has a scary story ? Kimberly ? Any scary stories ? Fuck no , girl , I don 't got no scary stories . Well , you got a scary story , baby , come on . Come up with something . Come up with something ... baby , you wanna put down the camera ? Join us , grab a beer , relax , please . You guys have no respect for tradition . Honey , I love you , but it 's tradition when you 're 12 . Whatever . Tough crowd . Uh , Ryan , you got anymore of that weed ? - Yes ! That 's communal ! Let 's smoke . - Yes ... No ! No , no , no . - Collin , you 're up . - I 'm up ? Yup , scary story , and go ! - You want a scary story ? - Yup , go . - Alright , I got a scary story . - Hit me ! I got a super fuckin scary story , you ready ? - Let 's hear it . - No , not really , at all . Alright . Well , there once was this talented young filmmaker ... - Ooh ! - ... that decided rather than to follow the path to fame and fortune , decided to teach Intro to Cinema at the local community college . Oh , that is super fucked up . - You wanted scary , right ? - We got it . And what 's worse is that most of his students took his class to avoid being challenged by a real teacher . You 're a really good teacher . He 's my favorite teacher . Right , ' cause that 's how they met . - Hot for teacher . - Hot for student . Yup . - That is illegal , though , right ? - Totally . Yeah , but my baby 's a rebel . No , no , no , no , she was over-age when we met , and we didn 't start dating until after she graduated college . Whatever , man , save it for the judge . You know what ? I 'm guilty . I 'm guilty , guilty as charged , for being in love with the most amazing woman on the planet , right ? Right ? Aw , thank you , sweetheart . You guys are so sweet . See , I ... I just threw up in my mouth a little bit . - Ryan , you suck . - Hey ! I 'm kidding , alright ? It is sweet , it is . To Kim and Collin , good friends , good couple , good for each other . I love you guys . Here , here ! - Righty , baby ? - Yes , sir . Ooh , right , okay . That would be my cue to exit .

It jumped into the tree ! What was ... It was an animal . I 'm too drunk and tired for this . Ryan , Ryan , we need to go ! There 's no animal that moves like that . I think you 're spazzing out just a little bit . I 'm not spazzing out !

Okay , well , exactly , you don 't know what it was ! That 's why we 're not gonna leave here ! If he 's gonna be a shit , make him think we 're leaving him . Collin , this is kind of crazy .

Well , we 've seen what this thing can do . It 's like the Spartans , Apaches , and the Samurai all rolled into one . Everything ... My whole life ... right now . Kill or be fucking killed . Law of the jungle . Simple as that . Alright . Hunts on , fuckers ! Okay , okay . It 's gonna be fine . I 'm gonna find a way out . It 's gonna be fine . Oh , my God ! A trailer ! Hello ? Hello ! Someone there ? That 's weird . One moment I 'm hot . Another one , I 'm freezing cold . The clock on my phone says 4 : 45 , so just another hour or so until the sun should be start ... coming up .. I have no food and no water . I 'm so tired . I 'm so thirsty . It was ... It was more than three hours ago since I last saw Collin . I have this horrible feeling like maybe the sun will never come up , you know ? Whatever that thing was that attacked us ... Whatever ... I can 't ... I can 't ... God . My mind 's real foggy . It 's like I can 't remember what I was just thinking a second ago . Ryan ... Oh , Ryan ! I love you . I don 't think I realized that until now , but I really fucking love you . If anybody would find this ... Whatever happens ... To my Mom and Dad , James and Margaret Powell on thirty-five ... Fuck . Thirty-five , twenty-five East Pine Lane , Jeffersonville , New York . I love you both , so , so much . To Ryan 's mom and stepdad ... To Kim and Collin 's family ... I wish I could explain what 's going on . I wish I know something ... I can 't , I can 't , I don 't know . God said , " Let us make man in our image , after our likeness , and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth . " Alright , now . What I got to show you now is something truly illuminating . I know it don 't look like much , but this here is a blood trail . yeah , this here ain 't nothing good . Not natural . Not bright like it should be . It 's black . Like the blood from the heart , but even darker still . Dark blood of a dark prey . You bring hell to me , demon , and I 'll bring it right back at ya , you fucking night stalker . I can hear you breathe . I can hear your thoughts . I 'm inside you ! Look what we got here . More tell-tells ? Oh , damn , you 're gushin' like a sieve , ain 't ya , boy . Whoa ! You 're not who I 'm lookin ' for . Hey , hey , hey there , you don 't look so mean .

Collin ! Collin ! Collin ! Collin ! Hey . Collin ? Collin ? Hey . I need you to repeat what you just said to me , okay ? Please , Collin . You said you know something , you-you been somewhere . You know what 's been going on here . - You need to tell me ! - There was an accident . What-What accident ? It wasn 't supposed to happen . None of this . I ... I don 't understand . I 've seen things . They told me things . What ... Who told you ? An accident . Like a nuclear meltdown of the cosmos , an outbreak . But it 's okay . I 'm safe now . What ? How ? They can 't hurt me . But they can still hurt you . Gunshots ! They seem to be coming ... coming form there . Oh , my God , whoever it is , at least it 's human . Hello ? Hey !

What 're you lookin ' at me like that for , huh ? Huh ? ! Hell with you then . Doctor Margo Thompson here with a quick rundown of what we know . We 're still a long way from making sense of all this . I 'm sending everything to you on a coded frequency . Got multiple enemies ! With all the variables that we were dealing with here , it seemed that containment was our first priority . What 's even more of a puzzle is our one known survivor . A man who , for unexplained reasons , has escaped contamination , physically at least . Psychological damage was extensive , which makes communication a real challenge . Today is Wednesday , the fifth of June , 2014 . I 'm here with Subject 31 , Collin Dean Barstow . Subject has been given 400 milligrams of Haldol to stabilize his behavior . He appears removed , but has been more responsive than in our previous attempts to conduct this interview . Mr. Barstow ? Collin ? I would really like you to tell me what you remember . What you remember ? Yes . What you remember ? Anything ? Anything at all ? Collin , I need to know what you saw . Under hypnosis , you mentioned to Dr. Brenner ... quite an amazing story . You told her that , after your friends and you were exposed , that you were taken captive . And that you were even able to establish a method of communication with those who abducted you . That you were taken out of the forest and onto some kind of craft . I said that ? I have a recording of it right here . What about these ? Collin , can you tell me about these drawings ? These symbols here ? My drawings ... Right . What do they mean to you ? Are they representative of something that you saw ? I 'm gonna play you something here , and I need you to tell me what it means . Please , Collin , you said you know something . You-You been somewhere . You know what 's been going on here . - You need to tell me ! - There was an accident . Wh-What accident ? It wasn 't supposed to happen . None of this . I ... I don 't understand . I 've seen things . They told me things . What ... Who told you ? And accident . Like a nuclear meltdown of the cosmos , an outbreak . But it 's okay . I 'm safe now . What ? How ? They can 't hurt me . Do you remember saying that ? Can you tell me what that means ? Why you ? What was it that made you safe ? Hey . Come on now . You gotta give me something here . They wanted to ... Go on . They wanted to try and find it . To stop it . Don 't stop , Collin . You 're doing great . Collin ? Come on . Come back to me , buddy . Collin ? Let 's try something else . Hey , Kimmy ! Time to wake up . Morning , baby . Morning , hey . What are you doing ? I 'm watching you . Am I totally creeping you out or what ? Pervert . How long have you been filming me ? I don 't know , 30 , 40 minutes ? Maybe less . - So creepy . - Uh-huh . Hey , someone 's camera-shy . Come on , baby . Give it to me . What ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Give it . Kimmy ... Yes , let 's start with Kimberly . What happened to her ? I know this is hard , Collin . It 's also really important that you tell me everything . I need you to remember . We need to go back to that place in the forest . Collin , what can you remember ? Everything . Okay ... Hey , Kimmy ? Baby , can you come here for a sec ? - Yeah ? - Hey , sexy . Who me ? Yeah , you . Who else would I be talking about ? I don 't know , maybe one of those little freshmen that I always see you drooling over . Aw , what ? No . Come on , you ... They 've gotta know you give out extra credit - to the girl with the sweetest ass . - Whatever ! - Am I right ? - You 're crazy . Really ? Yeah , you 're crazy to think that I would ever be checking out any other girl . Oh , that 's weird . I 'm sorry . What now ? There 's something digging into my back . Ow . - Can you ... Can you reach around ... - What is it ? I don 't know what it is . It 's digging into me . Is it a freshman ? I 'm serious ! I 'm serious ! It 's not . It 's weird . It 's weird ? Ow . And ... Oh , I think you found it . Wonder what that could be , huh ? Hey . Kim ? - Well ? - Well ? Come on , you 're killing me . This is how you ask ? Marry me . Can I take that as a yes ? Yes ! Yeah ? - I love you . - I love you , too . You wanna see some crazy shit ? I 'll show you some crazy shit . That 's some crazy shit .

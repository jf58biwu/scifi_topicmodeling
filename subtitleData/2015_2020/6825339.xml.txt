 ( Music playing ) I used to think this was the beginning of your story . Memory is a strange thing . It does not work like I thought it did . We are so bound by time . By its order . It 's okay . Come back to me . Come back to me . Come back to me . Stick em up ! You are the sheriff in this here town ? My tickle guns are gonna get you ! You want me to chase you ? You better run . ( Kid giggling ) I remember moments in the middle . I love you . I hate you ! And this was the end . Come back to me . Baby , come back to me . And now Im not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings . There are days that define your story beyond your life . Like the day they arrived . Good Morning . Where is everyone ? Ok ... Well let 's get started . Today , we 're talking about Portuguese and why it sounds so different from the other Romance languages . The story of Portuguese begins in the Kingdom of Galicia ... ( cellphone ringing ) In the Middle Ages ... when a language was seen as an expression of art . ( cellphone ringing ) Any news you want to share ? Dr. Banks can turn you turn the TV to the news channel ? ( news on tv ) ... But police have already set up a perimeter around the area As you can see , we got just about as close as we can ... but unfortunately , Montana right now , is on complete lock down . The object apparently touched down ... 40 minutes ago , just north of * * * * * * 04 . We are waiting to hear if this is perhaps an experimental vessel or ... Hold on ... Im learning that more objects like this Have landed in as many as eight other locations around the world Yes ? Henry ? This is from a site in Hokkaido . This is worldwide and is happening right now . ( Alarms going off ) Okay ... um ... Class is dismissed . ( Aircraft flying by ) The Pentagon is simply asking for cooperation while authorities assess the object . You are saying its not ours ? - Do you even know if its from Earth ? - We are collecting information . We 're coordinating with other countries . We are not the only ones to have one of these in our backyard . If this is some kind of peaceful first contact , why send twelve ? Why not just one ? I do not know , Mom . Im watching the same news you are . Mom ... mom , please don 't bother with that channel . How many times I have to say that those people are idiots ? Do I sound nervous ? Ok , exactly ... so ... Yeah , me ? You know me . Im about the same Mom , I 'm fine . Ok , I 'll call you later - bye . And in around eight hours after landing , Theres still no signs of what might be called " first contact . " The objects measuring at least 1500ft tall Two more have reported to have penetrated Russian airspace . One in Siberia and the other on the coast of the Black Sea above the ocean . So far there are 12 unidentified objects spread across the globe there is no obvious logic to their locations And no evidence that the ships are even occ entertain the idea that if it is a kind of vessel , it may be unmanned . Regardless , we have a protocol for scenarios like this . LIVE FROM VENEZUELA ( Footsteps ) After two days ' of extraordinary events , the President this morning , has declared a state of emergency With as many as 5,000 National Guard being deployed to the state of Montana , alone . Borders are closed and flights have been grounded , stranding millions of travelers . gas , water and food continues to escalate and federal authorities have temporarily lifted the overtime limit on law enforcement . The ATF has put a temporary ban on new gun licenses , forcing many independent suppliers of hunting equipment and firearms to close their doors to the public . 48 hours later and no further development ... Two days . And the public now expects us to know all the answers . I 'm Colonel G.T. Weber . We havn 't formally met , but two years ago , You did a Farsi translation for the Italians ? You made quick work on those insurgent videos . And you made quick work with those insurgents . You 're on top ... on everyone 's list when it comes to translations . And yet youve been two years in the SSBI . So , you still have top secret clearance . So thats why I 'm in your office and not in Berkeley . Okay ? I have something I need you to translate for me . ( Recording plays ) Why are you here ? Can you understand us ? Where did you come from ? Now you heard ... what you make of it ? - Is that ... ? - Yes . - How many ? - How many what ? How many were speaking ? Two . They were speaking at the same time . Are you sure they had mouths ... How would you approach translating this ? You hear any words ? Phrases ? I do not ... I do not know . So what can you tell ? I can tell you that it is impossible to translate an audio file . I would need to be there to interact with them . You did not need that for Farsi translation . I did not need because I already knew the language , but this is ... I know what you 're doing . - Tell me what Im doing . - I 'll not take you to Montana . Its all I can do to keep it turning into a tourist site for everybody who has a ( TH ? ) clearance . Im just telling you what it would take to do this job . It is not a negotiation . If I leave here ... your chance is gone . Good day . Colonel ... You mentioned Berkeley . Are you going to ask Danvers next ? Maybe . Before you commit to him ... ask him the Sanskrit word for " war " and its translation . An agreement on sharing scientific discoveries Was closer tonight as Russia and China * * * * * at the United Nations . Meanwhile , financial markets across the world are in crisis with the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2,000 points ... ( Chopper approaches ) - Good Morning . - Colonel ? Gavisti . He says that means discussion . - What you say means ? - A desire for more cows . Pack your bags . - All right , give me 20 minutes . - Take only 10 ! Dr. Banks ! This way , please . - Are you alright ? - Yes . Inaudible dialogue due to noise inside the chopper ) Thanks . Sorry . Couldn 't hear what you were saying . " Language is the foundation of civilization It is the glue that holds the people together It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict . " Louise , esse Ian Donnelly . Louise Banks , Ian Donnelly . - Quite a reading ! - Yeah ... you wrote it . Yeah . It 's the kind of thing you write as a preface . Dabbled with the basics . It 's great . Even if its wrong . - Its wrong ? - The cornerstone of civilization isn 't language - its science . Ian is a theoretical physicist at Los Alamos . You 'll report to me , but will be working with him when you are in the shop . Thats what they are calling the UFO ? Priority One . What do they want , Where are they from ? Beyond that , how did they get here ? Are they capable of faster than light travel ? I made a list of questions ranging from handshakes to binary sequences ... How about we just talk to them before we start throwing problem at them ? That 's why you both are here . I 'll bring the coffee . Coffee with some aliens . - Take them to Dr. Kettler . - Yes sir . Follow the Captain to the Medical Wing . The procedure takes just a few minutes , then we 'll start . Alright . They will take care of your bags ... and cell phones . Follow me . Put this on and wear them all times . Sir , they 're here . Louise Banks , Ian Donnelly . When was your last meal ? - Last night . - Same . When was the last time you did something stressful ? Does now count ? - Just saying . - Who 's being ... Carted off in a med-bag ? Not everyone is able to process experiences like this . Im gonna take some bllod from you . and give you an immunization doze to cover you against bacterial threats . Can you sign this please ? Before we can start . - Are any of you claustrophobic ? - No . Are taking any medication , any allergies ? pregnant ? The boost doze may give a kick to your systems , so you may experience side effects : like nausea , dizziness , headaches . Or even a ringing in your ears . ( Indistinct conversation in the background ) ( People conversing online ) In exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds gravity starts to shift and fall out of the room . Have you found a scientific explanation for it ? - Like is it for them ? - No , I think it is for us . There seems to circulate air inside the chamber , so ... After two hours , you run out of oxygen . It doesn 't take you 18 hours to pump fresh air into a room ? Atmosphere . - Excuse me ? - If their atmosphere is different from earth , It would take hours to balance the concentration of air and the pressure everytime we open their door . Are you saying that could suffocate us if they wanted to ? This is Agent David Halpern , the CIA . - Let me take you to your stations . - Yes sir . We need the answers as soon as possible . What they want , where they came from . Why you are here , this is the priority . Everyone . This is Dr. Ian Donnelly , he will lead the team . Have they responded to anything ? Shapes , patterns , numbers , Fibonacci ? We can 't tell what they were saying , but they responded to " hello " , so ... Ok that is all . What have you figured out ? We 're just getting started . Good Morning . This is Dr Louise Banks . - She will be heading your team . - Dr. Banks , its a pleasure Dr. Banks is taking over the mission from Dr. Waller . ( Alarm sounding ) The 15 minute alarm . What kind of radiation are we walking into ? No , this is just for safety . So is there any physical contact ... with them ? I 'm the only one * * * * * * * * * , aliens ? It has a wall made of glass , we do not make contact . What they look like ? You 'll see soon enough . Hurry up . The suits are clumsy at first . But you 'll get used to them . All personnel in the second vehicle . We get there in a few minutes . Make sure you hold onto something . Every 18 hours ... the door opens at the bottom . Thats when we go in . ( Glowstick lands ) Yeah , that has happened . Alright , lets move . Time is wasting . You ready ? You ready ? ( Voice on comms ) It 's okay , sir . - you can proceed . - stand by Okay , bring it up . You okay ? Yeah . Dr. Banks . You can do it . C 'mon . I ... I think ... Grab her . Dr. Donnelly , you cool ? yeah ! Holy fuck ! We go down in there , You can start your job . - ok . - ok . - Everybody , move up . - Alpha Team in position . We 're on the move . Setting up equipment ... ( Bird chirping ) ( Chirping continues ) ( Breathing heavily ) What happens now ? They 'll arrive . ( Aliens approaching ) Dr. Banks ? Dr. Banks ? You can start . ( Voice on comms ) Wait ... Just a minute . I 'm fired ? You were better than the last guy . That does not make me feel any better . You have till 0200 hours to think something up . And what happens then ? You go back in . ( Recording plays of alien conversation ) Violence continues to spread across the US today * * * * * * . The President has declared a mandatory dusk to dawn curfew after the crack down by the National Guard Failed to prevent a third night of looting across the country . In North Dakota , 144 members of the St. Lawrence Pentecostal occult Are feared dead after they set their compound ablaze . Their website claims , the arrival of aliens Set in motion a prophecy that 12 ... ( Indiscernible audio on radio ) Uh .. we 're up in 15 ... You got any new intel ? Yeah . We 've been playing back some of their sounds ... And where has that got you ? When they play audio back at us . Its from an unseen source What are you up with ? Conversations from inside the room . Branches of dialogue . We have nothing . ( Voice on comms ) - Whats that for ? - Visual aid . Look , I 'm never going to be able to speak their words , if they aren 't talking . But they might have some sort of written language or basis for visual communication . Ok . Let 's start . ( Scribbling " HUMAN " on board ) Human . Human . I 'm human . And you ? Human . ( Bird fluttering in its cage ) - Oh my God . - Are you recording this ? Yes sir . I have sent this to base . Louise , its incredible ! Human . Human . Human . Okay ... Slow down Louise . I don 't want to take away from your success , but Dr. Banks , is it really the right approach ? Try to teach them how to speak and read ? - Thats gonna take long . - You 're wrong ! Its faster . Everything you do here , I have to explain to a room full of men , whose first and last question Is how can this be used against us . So you 'll have to give me more than that ! Kangaroo . What is that ? In 1770 , Captain James Cook 's ship ran aground off the coast of Australia and led a party , where they found the aboriginal people . One of the sailors pointed to the animals that hop around and put their babies in their pouch , And he asked what they were . The Aborigines said " kangaroo " . And your point is ? It wasn 't until later that they learned that " kangaroo " means " I don 't understand " . So ... I need this so that we don 't misinterpret things in there , otherwise it is going to take 10 times as long . I can sell that for now . But I need you to submit your vocabulary of words before the next session . Remember what happened to the Aborigines . A more advanced race , nearly wiped them out . - Its a good story . - Thanks . Its not true , but it proves my point . HUMAN ? I think we can present some prime numbers here . - It 's something . - Congratulations , you 're a parrot . Its a lot more than that , you cheeky bastard . Dont you see ? They can 't seem to follow our algebra . But complex behaviours - that clears . That does not make any sense , does it ? Problem is , not everyone shares our policy of being open with the aliens . That is Gen. Shang . It is gathering strength in Shanghai and at least four other nations would follow him . - Louise , we need get ground today . - ok . - You have the vocabulary for me ? - I do . You 're gonna teach them your name and Ian 's ? Yes , so that we can learn their names , if they have names , and then introduce pronouns later . These are grade school words . Eating , walking . Help me understand . No no no ! Not the top ! " What is your purpose on Earth ? " Ok , this is where you want to get to , right ? - That is the question . - Right . So , first we need to make sure that they understand what a question is . The nature of our request for information on the response . Then we need to clarify the difference between a specific " you " ... and a collective " you " . We don 't want to know why a ' Joe ' alien is here , we want to know why they all landed . A purpose requires an understanding of intent . We need to find out do they make conscious choices , or is the motivation so instinctive that they don 't understand any why " ? " question at all . And biggest of all we need to have enough vocabulary with them , that we understand their answer . Yeah . Stick to your list . Just ... Don 't add anything to it . Let 's get started . ( Scribbling on the board ) ( closes pen ) Louise . Louise , I 'm Louise . What is that ? Is that a new symbol ? I can 't tell . I don 't know , I think its the symbol for " human " again . But with a curl at the end . Maybe they indicate a question . I don 't know . I do not know , Louise , I think they are confused . Dr. Banks , move to the next word . Dr. Banks ! - Its okay . - Whats going on ? What are you doing ? - Im fine . - Are you crazy ? They need to see me . She 's taking off protection . Dr. Banks ! Are you ok ? You are at risk of contamination . - They need to see me . - Dr. Banks . - Dr. Banks . - She 's going upto the screen . Should we abort ? Go back to your stations . Ominous music plays Now that 's a proper introduction . Louise . I 'm Louise . Ian , you want to introduce yourself ? I ... Louise . ( Screw it ? ) Everyone dies one day , right ? Sir , Donnelly is taking off his suit too . Permission to abort ? Continue with the session . Ian . Louise . You ? Who are you ? I think those are their names . They have names . So what are we gonna call them ? I do not know . I was thinking of Abbott and Costello . Yeah . I like it . I like it . ( vehicle approaches ) Vehicle One , exit your vehicles and proceed to the decontamination camp . Do not take the masks . Not to withdraw their masks , and adhere to the decontamination room . - How do you feel ? - Overworked . Like I said , I need to tell you , you put yourself at risk . There is no signs of radiation poisoning ... yet . I 'll check your blood . - For now , Im gonna give you another boost . - ok . - No radiation ? - Nothing else we can detect either . But I will still give her a strong cocktail , regardless . It was the first time we made significant progress . Alright . We 'll take the risk . - Honey ... honey . - What 's going on ? - Can you tell me something ? - No . - You are worried . - How can I not worry ? Calm down . Becky asked if the monsters are going to kill Dad . Honey , its not gonna happen . - Come soon , please . - No need to worry . I 'm so scared . music playing Here are some of the many things we don 't know about the heptopodes . Greek : Hepta seven . Pod foot . Seven feet . Heptápode . Who are they ? Trying to answer this in any meaningful way is hampered by the fact that , outside of being able to see them and hear them , They have deposited absolutely no footprint . The chemical composition of their spaceship is unknown . The Shell emits no waste , no gas , no radiation . Assuming that the ships communicate with each other , they do so without detection . The air between the shells is controlled by sonic emissions or light waves . They are scientists or tourists ? If scientists , they don 't seem to ask a lot of questions . Why they land in these places ? The world 's most decorated experts can not figure that out . The most plausible theory is that they chose places on earth With the lowest incidences of lightning strikes . But there are exceptions . The second most plausible theory is that Sheena Easton Had a hit song in each of these sites in 1980 . So ... we just don 't know . How do they communicate ? Here , Louise has brought us all to shame . The first breakthrough was discovering that there is no co-relation between what a heptápode says , and what a heptápode writes . IAN YOU Unlike all human written language , their writing is semasiográfica . It conveyes meaning , it does not represent sound . Perhaps they view our form of writing as a wasted oppurtunity , Passing every second communication 's channel . We have our friends in Pakistan to thank For their study on how the heptápodes write . Because unlike speech , a hologram is free of time . Like their ship or their bodies . their written language has no form or no direction . Linguists call this nonlinear orthography . Which raises the question : " Is this how they think ? " Imagine you wanted to write a sentence using 2 hands , starting from either side . You have to know each word you wanted to use , as well as how much space they will occupy . A heptápode can write a complex sentence in two seconds effortlessly . It took us a month to make the simplest vocabulary . Next , explain the vocabulary . Louise thinks it will easily take another month to get ready for that . Hey . - Hi . - Weber 's looking for you . Why do you think I 'm hiding out here ? C 'mon up . - Nice out here , huh ? - Yeah , it 's a nice view . Away from the noise . You know , I was just thinking about you . You approach language like a mathematician . You know that right ? I will take that as a compliment . But it is . And ... I want you to Steer us around these communication traps that I did not even know existed . What ... ? I guess this is why I 'm still single . Trust me , you can understand communication and still end up single . I feel like everything that happens there ... It comes down to the 2 of us . It 's a good thing , alright ? You and I ? See those jokers that we are working with ? Thank God , I got you . ALIEN CRISIS | DAY 25 VENEZUELA UNITED KINGDOM SAVE OUR SPECIES ! Tonight , the first photo of the aliens goes viral . Biological contamination is a major risk factor At the Montana site . So say environmental pressure groups . 800,000 march on Washington to protest the government 's handling on the crisis . All this and more , special coverage . First contact was inside that thing . Who 's in charge ? The government , of course . The same government who ruined our backyard and bankrupted our military . Look at these people . Most of them don 't even have guns . We could be facing a full scale invasion invasion . Our President is willing to sit back , and let them overtake the country . We are falling asleep at the wheel , people ! You know what Im talking about ! The smartest thing to do right now , would be a show of force . I 'm talking about a shot across the brow . I want to know what you think about all this . whats this word ? Green Planet ... The Earth is a planet . Want to see my project for Miss . Garrett 's class ? Of course , little nose . We had to make up our own TV show . If we had one . - Who are those two people ? - Thats you and Dad . The show is called : " Mommy and Daddy talk to animals . " Its lovely . Ok . - It 's okay to be sad that your dad and I ... - I know . I 'm not . We both love you very much . I know . It 's just a drawing - not real . Louise ? Are you alright ? Yes I 'm fine . I not sure if it 's something ... I can explain . Would you like a checkup with Dr. Kevin ? I am ok . It 's fine , I 'm ok . ( no dialogue ) How are you feeling ? I need some sleep , but ... I am fine . Yeah ? I 've been doing a bit of reading about this idea that ... What if you emmerse yourself into a foreign language ... - You can actually rewire your brain . - It is a hypothesis . It is a theory that ... It is the theory that ... The language you speak determines how you think . Yes , it affects how you see everything ... I 'm curious . Are you dreaming in their language ? I 've had some dreams . I don 't think that makes me unfit to do this job . ( knocking on door ) - Did you sleep ? - A little . Know Mandarin ? People talking The voice you 're about to hear belongs to the Chinese military chief . General Shang . Put it on . We also have a live feed , if you want to look . Rewind . Stop . He is saying each of the 12 is offering advanced technology . Go back again ... play . The scientific team is attempting to decode the sense ... " sense " ? I dont know what that means . Something that will manage . Suits , honor and flowers . I don 't ... - I don 't know , that 's all . - I don 't know what it means either . An hour ago , China mobilized forces ... and now Russia is following suit . Shang is about to start something . All same suits ... Suits ... suits , honor , flowers ... Colonel , those are all parts of Mahjong . God ... are they ... ? They are using a game to communicate with the Heptápodes ? Maybe ... why ? Lets say I taught them chess instead of English . Every conversation would be a game , every idea expressed through opposition . Victory ... defeat . You see the problem ? If all I ever gave you was a hammer ... Everythings a nail . We need to ask the big question . Ready or not . ( People chattering on comms indiscernably ) ( coversing continues ... indiscernable ) HeptÃ ¡ podes purpose . ( murmering ) Purpose of heptÃ ¡ pode . Earth . What is your purpose ? Do we only have Costello ? Ok . There you are . What is he saying ? Offer weapon . You saw what they wrote . Using a word that they don 't fully understand . Enough ! Louise . We don 't know if they understand the difference between a weapon and a tool . Our language like a culture is messy , and sometimes one can be both . I think it 's quite possible that they are asking us or them for something . Not the other way round . Like the first part of trade . So how do we clarify their intentions beyond these two words ? I go back in .. right away we go back in ... we clear this out .. - It 's more complicated than that . - How is it more complicated than that ? Col. , the Secretary of Defense is on the line for you . We need to sit on this information till we know what it means . So we aren 't sharing it with our enemies . We have to consider the idea that our visitors are prodding us to fight among ourselves , till only one faction prevails . - There is no evidence for that . - Sure there is . Just grab a history book . British in India , Germans with Rwanda . They even got a name for it in Hungary . We are a world with no single leader . Its impossible to deal with just one of us . We have the word weapon now ... ( Col Weber on phone ) Yes general . ( Alarms sounding ) ( People conversing ) What did they say ? China and Russia are off the grid . They aren 't speaking very well . What they learnt in the last session has them spooked . Yes sir . We have orders to do the same . - Wait these are our allies ! - Put your radio on silence ! - Do it . - We received a message from the heptÃ ¡ ... Damn it ! We need to be talking to each other ! You want to talk to them ? Find out what this means . ( Man on radio ) This cam is now offline ... We 've never re-entered the session before . Louise , trust me ok ? We got time . Just gotta step on it , alright ? " USE WEAPON " This is the alien message sent to provoke the Chinese government to withdraw their scientists from the international mission today . In a statement , General Shang said : " China no longer trusts the aliens who wants to divide us . Humanity must be protected . " China has asked for immediate talks at the UN . ( Man on comm ) Alpha 1-9 , this is Condor . Over . Alpha 1-9 , this is Condor . Come in . Over . Captain Marks , Condor , not receiving a transmission . Let me know if you are listening . Capt. Marks , all escorts are ordered to cease all activites ... video has jumped back to 00 : 42 : 15 mins Not subbing this again . Jump to 01 : 39 : 06 No , no , no ... Dr. Banks you can 't go in there . - Just need to ask one question . - Dr. Banks ! The session is closed . You can 't go back in , it 's dangerous ... We just need 5 minutes . No sweat . Morris , Let him go . Hey , Abbott . So , what are calling our session ? Session 37 ? - No 36 Part 2 - Ok . Why are you alone ? Been attempting to call Capt. Marks . - The escorts not responding . - Why not ? Send security . Offer a weapon ... question mark . They are offering us something . Technology , device , method ... See this ? This is a different word . This ... this segment is a lot busier . Give ... technology Now . Whats he doing ? Capt. * * * * * * check . security team coming , sir . 4 minutes remain . We must see this through . Come on . Download weapons . - Fire * * * * * * * . - Understood . We will open shooting soon . To be no casualties . Abbott wants me to write on the barrier . Can you even do that ? I don 't know . ( places writing the ground ) I can 't do it with both hands . ( Background music ) Louise . What is that ? Hey ... Hey ... Hey ... Take it easy . You suffered a concussion . Just lay back . How you feeling ? - How is Ian ? - Well , same as you . He is ok . - Who ... who did this ? - Some soldiers . Been watching too much TV . - What is that ? - take it easy ... take it easy The place is no longer secure . We 're on standby to evacuate . Where is Ian ? Weber came and got him maybe 10 minutes ago . He wouldn 't leave till he knew you were okay . The whole tent is on the clock to figure out whatever it is you were given up there . This is all of it ? The feed wasn 't interrupted by the explosion . Thats right . - You see something ? - I don 't know yet . I need my team get together with Louise 's team . - I need everyone working on this . - We can not leave . - Glad to see you awake . - We need to go back in there and explain to them that this wasn 't our fault . - We can 't go back inside . - We have to ! What happened in there was an attack . We can hope for the best , but we have to prepare for retaliation . we may have to evacuate ... Thats a wrong move . As long as they stay , we have to stay . Well , they are not leaving . Why does it feel worse ? China is on the offensive . They are positioning their military to blow the alien vessel right out of the sky . If this happens , we can 't sit and wait for their retaliation . So get prepared . The Air Force and Infantry are standing by . BREAKING NEWS Tonight , China becomes the first world power To declare war against the aliens . Following the failure of the diplomatic efforts of the United Nations , China confirmed that its language experts tonight ... delivered an ultimatum at the Shanghai site . In a televised statement , Gen. Shang , chairman of the People 's Liberation Army , Said the aliens have 24 hours to leave Chinese territory , or face destruction . And he urged all other world leaders to unite with China and take a similar stance . With a huge build up of forces at their landing sites , Pakistan , Russia and Sudan Are thought to be following China 's lead . It can 't be random . Its going to take us years . Whats this term here ? Mum . - Mother ? - Hm ? - sweetie ? - Whats this term for that thing ... Like a technical term ... When we make a deal and we both get something out of it ? - A compromise ? - No ... Like it 's competition , But both sides end up happy . And win-win ? more sciency than that . If you want science , call your father . Thank you . Sorry . Its okay . What time is it ? Its time to open the bottle you 've been hiding . You cracked something , didn 't you ? Yeah . Come here . Take a look at this section . It seems to be talking about time . You see the symbol of " time " - everywhere . So what is this ? A formula for faster than light travel ? Who can tell ? It has too many gaps . Its not complete . Then it dawned on me . Right here . Stop focussing on the " 1 " s . Look at the " 0 " s . How much of it is data and how much of it is negative space ? So I measured it . 0.0833 recurring . Perhaps you 'd like to add that as a fraction . 1 / 12 . What is saying right here , is that , this is one of twelfth . - We are part of a larger hole . - Or 1 of 12 contestants for the prize . - Why do we have to talk to him ? - We all working together here . We need to talk to the other sites , We need to help them with what they got from the other HeptÃ ¡ podes . In case you don 't remember , we 're blacked out . China just threatened to destroy their Shell . We are on our own . But it says that all the pieces fit in . And I 'm telling you that no one else cares . Two hours ago we pulled this audio off a secured channel in Russia . Someone from their science team was broadcasting live . ( voice on recorder ) In their final session , the alien said : " There 's no time . Many become one ... " I feel we have all the given weapons . If anyone is receiving this ... Please ... ( sound of gunshot ) Well , I mean ... There are a lot of ways you can interpret what he said . I don 't need an interpreter to know what this means . Russia just executed one of their own experts to keep their secret . " Many become one " can be their way of saying Some only required . Why hand it out to us in pieces ? Why not give it all ? What better way to force us to work together for once ? Even if I did believe you , How in the world are you going to get anyone else to play along , and give out their data ? - We offer ours in return . - yeah ? - What , trade ? - Its a non zero sum game . Non zero sum game . Thats it . Thanks . 9 local completely isolated . Only way to reach them is to physically drive and yell at the border guards which we are doing . But it won 't be fast enough . There must be a way to get the message . To our allies , maybe . But at this stage , it 's little too late . What we need is to get all the other nations online ... before we start a war and theres no way for us to reach them Wait . Hold on a second . Louise . Its right above us . Thats problematic for us right now . The Pentagon is convinced that our Shell will retaliate . I 'd guess its orders say that we leave within the hour . Look they are not our enemy . They meant no act of aggression towards us . Maybe thats their way of being aggressive . - Its not the question . - Then what is the question ? How do we get you back in that room thats half a mile straight up ? I think our work here is done . Its in the hands of our superiors now . What the hell is she doing ? ( Coughing ) ( Door opening ) ( breathing ) Costello ? Where is Abbott ? " ABBOTT IS DEATH PROCESS " I 'm sorry . We 're sorry . I need you to ...

Come on , let 's go , let 's go . Come on . Meteorologists are debating the cause of the spiraling clouds first observed over the entire peninsula . Is this further proof of global warming ? Wait , wait ! That 's what people across the country have been asking since those mysterious cloud formations appeared in the sky earlier this morning . As camera phones around the world capture startling images of this bizarre phenomena , the weather forecast seems to be shifting by the minute . Let 's turn now to chief meteorologist Paula tally for some more insight into what could conceivably cause such out of this world ... Guys , guys ! You 'll never believe ... - Whoa . - Shh ! Look . Yeah , Donald , an event of these proportions is definitely something we haven 't seen before . What 's really shocking is just how rapidly it 's expanding ... Hey , what the hell is that ? Don 't ask me . I 'm gonna go get another beer . Not surprisingly , many are already calling this the storm of the century . Okay , Paula , we 've got new reports coming in from China , Brazil , and eastern Europe ... It 's everywhere . Well , uh , everywhere but here , thank god . Hey , guys . Pretty incredible , huh ? Why you think it 's happening ? You heard what they said , some type of meteorological shift . Have you been watching the news ? Global warming , mom . I love you , mom . Hey , guys . 'Sup ? The battery 's dead . Someone left the lights on . Don 't look at me . We 'll have to charge it overnight , all right ? I love you . I love you , too , sweetheart . Be safe . Bye . Smile . Some of you will recognize these photos from the Conden committee 's investigation into project blue book . The committee 's findings effectively ended the project in 1969 , but pilots continue to report strikingly similar experiences in the decades since . Bring him in . So , about that old story of yours , Mr. Romanovich . The one you never wanted to hear . Well , we 're all ears now . The hood 's been forced , char . What ? I found this ... Wedged between the positive terminal and the frame . Shorted out the battery . I think I know who it was . Yeah , dude . Earlier we found this abandoned cabin . It wasn 't so abandoned . It belongs to that weirdo , the guy who was screwing with Brendan at the station . Now he 's screwing with all of us . Okay , don 't mention anything about this to the girls , yeah ? We 're not letting some clown ruin our vacation . It 's confirmed . The visitors are still on track to arrive in your area . You can 't fight them , colonel . You can only make preparations ... For the aftermath . What 's he doing ? Yeah , yeah . So , should we give you guys some privacy ? How ' bout we , uh , shoot some pool ? Um , uh , I think I 'm actually just gonna turn in for the night , guys . Mm , now that sounds like a great idea . - Doesn 't it , babe ? - Mm-hm . Bye . She looks like a nice girl . Yeah . Well , then why 'd you break up ? We didn 't break up . Ha , I knew it . You 're such an asshole . - Think I 'm just some piece of ... - She died . What ? Yeah , um ... 10 months ago . In a car accident . - I 'm sorry , i ... - I had ... No , I , I thought rob said something . - I had , I had no idea . - Seriously , it 's okay . I 'm so sorry . It 's okay . One of the most controversial bloggers in the country is warning us about the extraterrestrial nature of those unusual cloud formations . Yes , Eva , what we are looking at here is the arrival of an extraterrestrial civilization . I have been saying this on television , on my website , for 20 years . This phenomena that we 're seeing in the sky cannot be disputed . The government is not telling us what 's going on . It 's an outrage . It 's been almost four hours ! Let 's go ahead and welcome our next guest , Dr. Lawrence Manning . Thank you for having me . Doctor , you 're claiming to have experienced direct contact with the visitors , as you refer to them . In march of ' 68 , I , myself , was taken . I awoke on a surgical table of some kind . They did things to my body . I cannot tell you the pain that I went through . Within the last few minutes , what appears to be a massive craft has started emerging . What was that ? It 's probably just the storm . They know I 'm here . You 'll be perfectly safe in this facility . It 's not me I 'm worried about . Kara ? What 's wrong , baby ? You okay ? What 's wrong ? Kara ? Hey guys , please , come here ! Baby ! - What 's wrong with her ? - I have no idea . She was standing by the window and just passed out . Kara ? Kara ! Kara ! Hey . What the hell happened ? I 'm okay . I 'm fine . Guys ! - You scared me , baby . - I 'm good , I 'm ... Guys , guys , you 're gonna wanna see ... - What 's wrong with her ? - I 'm fine . - She blacked out for a minute . - A minute ? Guys , guys , you have to see this , come on . No , come on ! Come on . Uh , you finally got the photo of the grizzly , man . Congratulations . - That 's not a bear . - Then what is it ? I knew that dirt bag was behind this . Thanks to you , Brendan . Guys , knock it off . Baby , relax . I got a gun in the car , a .38 . You brought a gun ? Wait , hey , hey , rob . Rob , what are you doing ? I 'm getting my gun . Let 's call my mom . Yeah . Damn . No signal . The storm probably knocked out the communication relays . Guys , whoa , what 's going on ? - Ahhh ! - Rob ! Let me in ! Open the door ! It 's rob . It 's rob . Let him in . Let him in . Hey , over here . What happened ? I-I tripped and the gun went off . - Rob , what the hell did you see ? - Baby , tell us ... Look , I don 't know what it was , okay ? Slow down , okay , rob ? You 're scaring everybody . I 'm , I 'm okay . I 'm okay . No , Kara . Just ... no . Get away from the window . Now . It 's out there . - The red glow . - Oh my god . Now I remember what happened to me . It came down from the cloud . Oh shit ! Is everybody okay ? The battery 's gotta be charged by now , right ? I say we get in the car and head to the closest town . - Yeah . - Dude , that 's a two-hour drive . What about the hunter 's cabin ? The radio . We can call for help on the emergency frequency . We take this dirt road and keep our headlights off , we 'll be there in like five minutes . Why do I have the feeling you 're gonna get us all killed , char ? Something you wanna say , man ? Just say it . Hey ! Wanna finish this fucking pissing contest some other time ? Seriously . Look , she 's right . We all just gotta calm ... Hey , hey ! Seriously ? Did you just point the fucking gun at me ? I 'd hardly need a gun to take care of you , char . - Is that right ? - Yep . You 're a pussy , char . You 're the last person who should be calling the shots when lives are at stake . You son of a bitch , I know what you 're implying . Say it ! Guys , I don 't feel so good . Get off me ! Hey , hey . What 's wrong ? We 're all gonna die . I 'm not gonna let anything happen to you , you understand ? Hey . Hey . We have to go now , okay ? Doesn 't matter . They 're taking us no matter what . Some kind of , some kind of drone ? What the hell are we gonna do ? You two , head to the garage and unplug the car battery . Char and I will meet you there in five minutes , okay ? Go ! Come on , I need your help with Kara . Go . Go . Go . What the ? Where did she go ? It 's inside . Hey , not yet . What have I done ? I 'm sorry . Rob ? Go , go . Head up to the garage . Get in the garage , now . Come on . What happened to her ? I don 't know . I didn 't know it was her . What did you do ? We 'll get you out of here , baby . I 'm gonna get you to a hospital , okay ? No , no , no , no , no . No , no , no , don 't , don 't do this . Breathe . Breathe , baby . Breathe , breathe , okay ? Breathe , baby , please , breathe . Rob , just ... rob . Get off me ! Breathe , damn it ! She 's dead . Leave her . Move . No , no , no . She 's gone , okay ? Hey , rob , there 's nothing we can do , okay ? We gotta go , okay ? We gotta go to the car . No , no . - I don 't see anything . - Yeah , I know . That worries me . We have no idea what they 're capable of or what they are . We need a distraction , fellas . Rob ? What the hell ... rob , what the fuck are you doing , man ? Run to the forest . I said , run to the fucking forest ! Stop , rob ! Rob , calm , calm down . Calm down . We have to go . Charlie . - Rob ! - Charlie . We have to go now , damn it . We have to go . Come on . Charlie . Good , go ! Go ! Go ! Shit . Ow . Where you going , buddy ? Leaving me for dead ? Rob . Rob ! Run , run ! Annie . I need a moment . No , we don 't have a moment , okay ? We gotta go , okay ? What ? - What , what is it ? - You 're freakin ' me out . Right there , on top of that . Oh my god , it 's ... it 's a hand . It 's probably just a dead piece of bark . Just stay there , okay ? You 'll be fine . Oh my god . - Do you see anything ? - Shh . Go , go , go , go , go , run . What ? Run , run ! - Can you walk ? - Yeah . Okay . Okay . Let 's look at it . Oh no ! What 's the prognosis , doctor ? Well ... you 'll survive . - Yeah ? - Yeah . You know a lot about cuts , huh ? Maybe . What 're you thinking about ? Well , um ... let 's see . My best friend 's dead . And rob , rob just got fricking sucked into the sky , so that 's pretty much what 's on my mind . I know . I know , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Just , just keep it pressed against the cut , okay ? Yeah . Charlie ! Annie ! Ch-Charlie ! Help ! - Oh my god ! - It 's a bear trap . Don 't touch it ! Don 't touch it ! Shh , okay ? We gotta take it off , all right ? No , no , no ! Brendan , shh ! I 'm gonna call for help . I 'm gonna call for help , okay ? I 'm gonna take it off .

Might get a splinter . Plus mine 's bigger . What do you want ? My trap back , for starters . No , no , no , no ! Nice to see you too . Stop ! Ahhhh ! Stop your whining . Need some cheese with all that damn wine . This is an emergency . Hello ? Can anyone hear me ? This is the U.S. military . Where are you located ? Oh , thank god . Oh , thank god , yes . Uh , we 're up , uh we 're up near , uh , uh , Trinity lake . Those things are trying to kill us . Okay , listen . Please calm down . Where exactly in relation to Trinity are you ? Um , east of , uh , rich ... Richfield road . Please , you 've gotta hurry . Please . I understand . Reading dense vegetation at your locale . Can you make it to Garrity gulch ? Yeah . Yeah , I think so , yes . Copy that . The extraction team will meet you there just as soon as possible . Okay , thank you . Thank you . Oh my god ! Oh my god ! You got lucky . Artery along the tibia 's fine . Oh my god , guys ! There 's one inside . In the cabin . Just one ? Yeah . I-I can 't move . Come on , sissy boy . No , no ! - Time to dance . - Where the hell you taking him ? Follow me . Where we going ? Shh . Stop whining . Where the hell are you going ? What is he doing ? Help 's on the way . What ? I got through , on the radio . Thank god . We , we need to meet them at the lake , okay ? - Okay . - Okay . - What the hell is he doing ? - I don 't know . Gotcha ! Yeah . Yeah . Uh-huh . Welcome back . Remember me ? Oh , what a bad host I am . I 'm sorry . Maybe you 'd like something , something to drink . You look a little thirsty . Or maybe something to eat ? Here , you want something to eat ? I got the perfect thing for you . Motherfucker . What the hell , huh ? You used us as bait ? You piece of shit . What ? This funny to you ? Ow . You guys , I-i can 't feel my leg . You 'll live , sissy boy . This is gonna pinch . Is he gonna be okay ? That was the easy part . How-how did I get here ? He carried you . - Drink this . - What is it ? - You don 't wanna know . - Oh . - Tastes aw ... - Bite . This is gonna hurt . Okay . On three . One ... two ... Three . You ready ? Bren needs more time . We can 't just drag him . We 'll drive . You get the keys , and we 'll take the truck . Okay . I 'll distract him . Okay . So your work it 's , uh ... I mean , it 's pretty impressive , right ? Wait till you see what I got planned for our little friend from outta town . Won 't work . - Excuse me ? - What ? The truck . Won 't work . Head gasket blew already . Barely made it home this afternoon , myself . Oh my god . You can take the boat though . W-we 'll take it . What 's so funny ? I didn 't mean now . In the dawn . Maybe even have a ghost of a chance of making it . Sunlight seems to interfere with their , um , metabolism . Slows ' em down . Dawn ? You actually expect us to sit around here until dawn ? Doing what ? You 'd be lucky to make it 50 yards out that door , son . What makes you such an expert on these things anyways , huh ? Seventh of April , 1995 . Here we go . Sitting in the shuttle flight deck doing prelaunch checks . I blinked , to wake up and find myself face down in a deserted land 2,000 miles away . It was 48 hours later . No memory of where I 'd been . No memory of how the hell I get in the goddamn desert . Then after a while , things started coming back . Little things . Lights . Sounds . Smells . Tastes . Sounds like you had a hell of a trip , huh ? Yeah , we did . Yes , we did . Captain Romanovich and me . Forgot to show you my souvenirs . Yeah . And this one . This is how they mark the generals . Generals ? The ones that show promise before the adjustments . Just before the upgrades , you know . So you have a little something extra . What the hell are you talking about ? Preparing for the coming storm . For the last 60 years they been conducting test runs . Take one , two , at a time . All in preparation for tonight . Tonight 's mass abduction . I don 't believe you . What the hell are you ? Not really sure . Only discovered it a couple of years ago . 'Fore long everything started to come back . Everything , and more . You see some of them memories , they wasn 't my own . Mm-mm . Couldn 't've been . Figured they used some kind of , uh , neural implant or something . Yeah . But before long I knew everything about ' em . I knew that they had been here before , and I know they coming back . I know we still be swimming in tide pools if it wasn 't for them . What ? Found some of us hiding in caves when they came back for the second set of adjustments . Then after the next visit , homo sapiens were released upon the world . 250,000 years later , the next massive upgrade . Guess you could call it a bump up in human evolution . Not exactly what they teach you in Sunday school , is it ? Why is this happening . Why ? Did you know the first astronaut was a chimp ? And the second was a dog . The point I 'm making is that we seem to have no problem with using the lesser species for all our godforsaken experiments . Poke ' em with this , prod ' em with that , send ' em up in a rocket . I guess I figure , we pretty much the same to them . So what you ... you 've known about all this , about tonight , and you didn 't say a word to anybody ? I did say something . I told everybody . I told ' em all . Look . And they told me I was having a transformation of my sense of reality . Damn visitors took everything from me . So tonight ... I 'm gonna return the favor . Oh , shh . Sleepin ' . Hey , char . We 're , uh ... we 're gonna get outta here , right ? Hey . You think everything happens for a reason ? I don 't know . Why ? I was driving that night . We were on our way home from San Francisco . I was on cloud 9 . She , uh , she just said yes . I barely slept the whole night before , but I thought I could make it . We were almost home . Maybe an hour outside L.A. And I woke up to her screams . I 'd been thrown from the vehicle , but she was still pinned under the dash . I 'm stuck . I 'm gonna get you outta here , okay ? There was smoke everywhere . We gotta go , okay . We gotta go right now , okay ? - Come on . - I can 't . I can 't . Come on . Come on . - Rachel ! I couldn 't get her out in time . Oh my god . I 'm sorry . I think it 's time to go . Hey , Brendan . Brendan , wake up . Hey , you okay ? - What the heck is he doing ? - You don 't wanna know . - You ready ? - Okay , yeah . Come on , time to go . Come on . Annie , Annie , Annie , Annie . We gotta go , okay ? Stay inside . Where you going ? Lay out the welcome mat . Brendan ? Where is he ? He 's gone . Get behind me ! Your friend . Damn ! Good luck . What you waiting for ? What , a goodbye kiss or something ? Why us ? Why us ? Why you trying to wonder why you so special , huh ? Well you 're not . They 're here for me . Think we got some unfinished business . Yeah , sorry to break your heart , son . You just happened to be in the wrong neck of the woods at the wrong time . You might wanna get outta here while you still can . Hey , you comin ' ? Hell no ! I ain 't had this much fun in 20 years . Let 's go . - Wait , wait , wait , wait . - What ? - Wait . - What ? The lake 's too exposed . We 're gonna be safer here in the trees . No , no , no , no . It 's where they 're meeting us . - Who ? - What ? Who exactly did you talk to on the radio ? Okay , okay , okay . We don 't have time for any of your second guessing bullshit , okay ? You just need to trust me on this , okay ? - It 's gonna be fine . - I 'm not gonna lose you too . That was not your fault . That was not your fault , okay ? - You can 't let Rachel 's death ... - Don 't . Okay , fine . Do whatever you want . I 'm going to the lake . I 'm going . - Yeah . - Good . Annie , Annie . Annie . Annie . Oh my god . Oh my god . How ' bout that boat ride now , huh ? See I-i told you . I told you . Annie ? Annie , is that you ? Annie . Annie , where are you ? Annie ? Charlie ! Who 's there ? Charlie . Brendan ? Hey , hey . Brendan , buddy . They ... fixed me ... Charlie . What do you mean ? My leg , it doesn 't hurt anymore . Just stay with me , okay , buddy ? I 'm gonna , I 'm gonna get you outta here . What is it , Charlie ? Come ... come back . Where are you going ? Charlie ! Come back ! Hey , rob . Rob ! Charlie . Oh , I lost it a little bit back there , didn 't I , man ? I 'm sorry about that , brother . I 'm okay now . Oh , you don 't see it that way ? You 're afraid , char . I can hear your thoughts . But I don 't know where they 're keeping Annie . - Charlie ? Annie ? - Charlie ? - Annie ? Annie ! Annie ? Oh , thank god . Help me ! Help me ! Thank god . I 'm sorry , okay ? It 's okay . Let 's just get outta here , okay ? - All right . - Okay . - Oh my god . - Hey , hey , hey . - I can 't feel my legs . - Everything 's gonna be okay . Okay ? Just , just . Something 's holding me . Annie . Annie . Annie . Annie . Annie . Hey . Hey . Annie . Annie . Annie . Annie , stop . Stop , just , hey ! Charlie . Come back . Annie ? Annie , is that you ? Rachel .

Your new life 's about to begin . It 's okay . Okay . You , uh , you back from a hike ? Yeah . Do you remember what happened last night ? No . Must 've been pretty crazy there , right ? Dude , I feel super strong . Thanks . - Oy ! - Hey ! How 's it going ? - Morning . - Feels great . - How you doing ? - Good , how 're you ? Good . Whoo ! The craft is still ascending . Just lost visual . Decrease your altitude and begin assisting ground patrols . Scan all areas of reported contact . It 's confirmed , sir . The visitors are leaving . All the abducted appear to have been returned . Told you . Earlier this morning , astronomers reported a multitude of large objects that were detected passing beyond our solar systems . As suddenly as they appeared , the mysterious visitors have now departed with clear skies being reported worldwide . Well , looks like you missed your flight . Meanwhile , an international coalition has convened to determine a quarantine protocol for the estimated 20,000 returned . - Ma 'am are you okay ? - I 'm fine . I-I feel amazing . You can just let me go . Quarantine is now mandatory for anyone known to have made contact with the visitors . Your mom 's texting you . What ? How 'd you know ? What the hell is this ? What 's this all about ? Engine off . Everything all right , officer ? Gonna need you to step out of the vehicle , please . Hold there . Is there a problem , officer ? Not at all . - Got the markings . - Are you sure ? What do you wanna do ? We need to kill them ? You can hear them ? What 's going on ? No . No , no , no . Annie . You okay ? Hey ! She okay ? Let 's get outta here . Come on . Come on . Hey . Come on . Let 's go . Come on . Dispatch controller Tucker pd6682 on duty . Radio check . All vehicles to commence . Jg319 are you receiving ? Please confirm . Unit 131 is en route to burn the bodies . We 're not sure yet what these returned are actually capable of . Looks like a storm 's comin ' on . Definitely .

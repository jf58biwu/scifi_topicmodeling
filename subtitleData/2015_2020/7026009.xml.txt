 What are they gonna do to us ? Just come here . It 's okay . You guys want to pull up ? See anything ? - Something 's up . - Form up ! Take one ! Watch the flank ! Get down ! What 's going on ? - Let 's go . - Come on ! - Stop or we 'll shoot ! - Get that dirty rug ! Ahh ! Shoot that Hairy bugger ! Watch out ! Oi ! Come here . Stay down ! Djukara ? Djukara ? Djukara , no . Djukara , no . Wake up . Djukara , wake up ! - Djukara ! - Latani . No ! Latani , get up ! Come on ! Djukara ! No ! Run ! Go . No guard survived . And we have no idea where the attackers came from . Casualties from the Zone ? Eight human dead , 10 subhuman . The Authority deleted their details from the system when they were arrested in preparation for ... So the rest of them are loose somewhere in the city along with whatever the hell that thing was that attacked them . Footage leaks of Geoff Matthews being strangled while screwing a rug . Now I 've got dozens of fatalities and Christ knows how many subhumans roaming the city . We need a replacement . - They 're meeting now ? - There 's been an emergency . Yeah , I saw the Geoff Matthews footage . Everyone saw that . This is a new emergency . The chief of staff and I have never seen eye to eye . The secretary says he values your contribution . This is their own mess , and they want someone to take the fall for it . - But it 's also the first time ... - But it 's also a chance to finally have some influence over how this government does things . I was going to say it 's also a very big promotion . It 's him . Marion Frith . That 's everything we know . As minister , you will of course have my full support . - You want a sacrificial lamb . - Marion , that 's not ... Someone to clean up the Geoff Matthews mess , steady the ship before election , and then gracefully accept demotion . Of course not . I 'll do it . But I won 't walk away after the election . I want complete oversight of all relevant departments , including the CA . And no one can see that footage . Anything else ? It 's amazing . Fetal heart rate 's normal . What about development indicators ? Within the expected percentiles . Our last doctor was concerned with the rate of growth . Your baby is developing just fine . Well , why did I collapse , then ? I thought it might be a heterotopic pregnancy . There 's no indications of anything outside the uterus . We can rule that one out . What about anemia ? Well , your blood count 's fine and ... your blood pressure 's normal . Is there any possibility you might have just been overdoing it ? No . You had a lot of pressure on you . She was in quite a state before the collapse . I 've never seen you like that before . - I couldn 't find the clinic . - I know , angel . She got off at the wrong floor . I can speak for myself . So , what do you think , Doctor ? Honestly . Well , Dr. Cleary , you 're fit . You 're busy . Pregnancy 's not an illness . Perhaps you just need more rest at this stage . Well , I 'll show you out . Sedatives ? She 'd know that 's risky . At what point does survival outside the womb become viable ? Potential survival starts around 24 weeks . Prospects improve the longer the fetus stays in the womb . We may need to remove the fetus considerably earlier than that . I see . The fetus must remain viable and Charlotte safe , of course . I 'll make a list of the equipment we 'll need . Thank you . I 'll be in touch . - Waruu , you let yourself in . - Your CA destroyed the Zone . The plan was to reclaim the land . My family was there . You didn 't take them with you ? God , I 'm sorry . I believe some may have escaped . But you don 't know where . I gave you what you wanted . And you were paid handsomely . But I still don 't have what I want . Where is he ? What happened to your face ? Different rules apply to men like us , Waruu . We have to make difficult choices . There 'll be sacrifices . So what have you sacrificed ? So , each screen shows a different sector of the city ? Correct , and direct feed from the CA surveillance center , - as requested . - Excellent . They really do have eyes everywhere . Mr. Mclntyre , please . Minister , congratulations on the promotion . - Thank you . - I trust everything 's in order . It is , and I appreciate your making it happen so promptly . Perhaps you 'd like me to talk you through how things operate . Oh , no , that won 't be necessary , Mr. Mclntyre . My government 's grateful for the dedication you 've shown to your work , but your services as head of CA will no longer be required . - Your sacking me . - We 'll now be running things from within the Department of Human Safety . With all due respect , I do possess a great deal of corporate knowledge . It 's been a privilege to work for the government in these difficult times . Before you go ... You 're aware the attack on the convoy occurred in the southwest outskirts of the city ? Yes . Why aren 't your resources centered there ? We 're following operational guidelines , Minister . No , you 're not . Lucia , get onto the CA , redirect all units . Macclesfield estate , block by block search outwards . - And I want vision . - Leave it with me , Minister . Thank you , Mr. Mclntyre . I 'll organize someone to help you pack up your desk . That won 't be necessary . Already ? Did you catch the bird ? Sort out another way . I want him found . I 've got something that belongs to you . What ? It was your Uncle Jimmy 's . A house . Jimmy owned a house in the city ? You know he worked for me sometimes . It 's yours now . Aren 't you in need of a home ? And a job ? I have enough money to do what I like . Forgive me . Uh , my mistake . But as Jimmy 's heir ... Isn 't Koen Jimmy 's heir ? At least for the moment . Come on , Waruu , let 's finish what we started . This is your time . What else did Jimmy have that I don 't know about ? Just the house . Jimmy 's shit . Shut up ! Ladies and gentlemen , today we face an unprecedented security crisis . Despite liberating the Zone , it is now clear an unknown number of subhumans are at large in our city . In order to ensure public safety , the government has declared a state of emergency and security forces will be given increased powers to deal with the crisis . And a curfew will be enforced at sunset . These measures are not permanent . They will be an inconvenience . However , I believe they are necessary , and they should demonstrate to you that this government will spare no effort to protect you and to protect our way of life . We get to say who lives here and who doesn 't . And with your help , we will prevail . Thank you and God bless . Go . Next . Stop . Match . Next . Stop . Stop . Eyes forward . - Yeah . - Go . Next . I thought you were long dead . Why are you here ? Free booze . Aunty ... what happened ? You don 't remember ? The CA ... piled into the Zone . Smoke and noise everywhere . And a man in a flash suit , cold eyes ... he walk right through that smoke . So many shots . They dragged you away . We all had to surrender after that . And they rounded us up , chucked us into trucks and took our IDs . And then we were ambushed on the road . So , our people could still be there , where the trucks were hit . Hold on . Not a smart idea . They 've all disappeared . You don 't know that for sure , Aunty . Blair , he can help us . He did good by you , Koen . He went down . He threw himself at the man with the gun . I 've got to see it for myself . Koen ! There 's a car in the driveway . Where are the keys ? They 're in my pocket . The other pocket . You 're from the Zone , right ? You know they 'll be looking for you . There are roadblocks all over this city . I mean , how far do you think you 're going to get ? What do you care ? I 'm just saying . Don 't . Can your guy in the CA be relied on ? Marion Frith is not as smart as she thinks she is . This is a direct feed . What about Koen West ? My guy 's program should be able to track him . There , he passed through a CA checkpoint beside Central Station an hour and a half ago . And the Authority ? Well , no one else knows who he is . Hey , come out here . Come on . I can see you . You were ... you were dead . Is there anyone else ? Th-there 's others , but they 're miles away . They sent me back to see if anyone was left behind . Come on , now . Go . We 're going to make a slight detour . All right . Harry ! Harry , open up ! Special delivery . Minister , congratulations on your appointment . This is Waruu West , cultural expert on the Hairy people . Mr. West . Before you go any further , my decision to terminate Slade Industries ' contract with the Containment Authority is final . Ah , that 's not what I 'm here to talk about . Portable ID scanners . You already supply these to the Authority . Your checkpoints scan for IDs , correct ? So , a shaved-down Hairy in possession of a reasonable ID card could pass through your checkpoint undetected . It 's possible . Would you allow me to demonstrate ? This device analyzes the genetic code of a person 's DNA and enables you to tell immediately who is human and who is Hairy . As you can see , human . - This is a prototype ? - This is a model . 500 have been tested and are ready for activation . Isn 't that getting ahead of yourself ? Well , I saw a need . Mr. West is our foremost expert on the Hairy people . Any contract for these devices would need his input on their use . - No . - Minister ... I 'll take the 500 devices , but I 'm not employing him . But Mr. West could ... And I 'm not interested in your attempts to regain influence in the Authority . Thank you , gentlemen . Playing the long game here , Waruu . She didn 't even look at me . Pinot grigio , amber ale , pear cider , mate . - Hey . - You hear something ? - No , mate . Did you ? - Don 't think so . - Ahem . - Don 't bullshit me . I was here first . And who are you ? Don 't touch my cider , you pricks , all right ? Okay . This is who I am . Out . Get out ! Your attention , please . Curfew will begin at 7 : 16 PM . Anyone found away from their registered place of address will be placed under immediate arrest . Your attention , please . Curfew will begin at 7 : 16 PM . One of those girls your daughter , yeah ? No talking . Aren 't you scared having your daughter around one of them ? She 's just a kid . And your government 's so scared of her , they want to kill her ? She 's a Hairy . Can I ask how old you are ? How old are you ? Hmm ? We think you 're pretty weird , too , you know . All that skin and flesh exposed . You 're weak and slow and live a third of the time that we do . We could hunt you down and destroy your kind so easily . But we don 't . So , you want to ask any more questions ? Your attention , please . Curfew will begin at 7 : 16 PM . Anyone found away from their registered place of address will be placed under immediate arrest . There 's 22 of us here . It was 23 this morning . How many escaped ? There would 've been around 50 of us in the Zone . A few died at the vans . We need medicine for the wounded , bandages . And blankets . It 's freezing in this place . You can 't risk heading out into the city , but I can . Give us a list . We 'll get going . You 're not up to it , Aunty . I 'm not sitting around here using up supplies these buggers need . Besides , Nerida and Alinta are out there . I 'll bring you whatever I can find . How you going , Aunty ? Never seen a place as sorry as this . Well , better than being in a containment center . At least we get fed regular . Don 't know that for sure . Those trucks could 've been taking us anywhere . Fancy hotel , you reckon ? Imagine all us Hairy fellas ... crowding into a fancy hotel . Those skins wouldn 't know what to do , where to look . Wouldn 't want to touch anything in case they got contaminated . Probably close the place down after we 'd all gone . We could really mess them up . One day . Yeah . One day . Maybe we can offload some of it for cash . Yep . You ready to go ? You got some other clothes upstairs , or you fancy keeping that bullet-riddled look ? I 'll go change . Okay , let 's go shopping . - Oh ! - All righty . You scared the daylights out of me . What are you doing here ? I just wanted to help . We still have time to take him back . Come on , please . Can I stay ? Well , don 't look at me . - Keep your head down . - Okay . - I mean it . - Okay . Jeez . I want to know everything you 're doing here with the Hairies . Extreme adaptive ability is wired into the Hairy DNA . It 's the source of their power . Unfortunately for humans , the effects only lasted a couple of days and couldn 't be repeated . Why is that ? I don 't know . I wish I did . I need more Hairy DNA . But without access to the Containment Authority , these three are the only subjects I have left . What 's this ? Harvesting removes their strength . Their hair falls out . Okay if I talk to him ? I stood up and fought for your people and was cast aside , shown no respect . But things are about to change . You 're special , Boondee . You will be the Hairy who changes the lives of your people , and I will be the man who makes that happen . Then you will respect me . Get me another meeting with Frith . Hello , little subbie . Come out to play . Huh ? Come on . Come on . I want to see what you 're made of , subbie . Huh ? Now , now . No need to get cranky . Come on . Open up . Huh ? This Joplin . Jop-lin . Say , " Hello , Joplin . " Hello . Huh ? Enough ! - Oi ! - You ... Well , that was very silly , subbie . Hey ! Get away from him ! Get away from him , you dog ! No . Mungo ! No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . No . Come on , brother , breathe , breathe . Breathe , Mungo ! Come on . Come on . Come on , bruh . Come on , brother . Come on . You bastards !

 ( ENGINE REVVING ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) Hi , my fellow citizens of this great country of ours , the United Corporations of America . Why did those Pilgrims land on Plymouth Rock ? Because they needed a place to stage the greatest pissing contest known to man ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) That 's right , race fans ! We are moments away from the starting gun , and anticipation here has reached a medically dangerous level . The fifth installment of the great American tradition . Does it get any better than this ? Now , this is all about freedom . The freedom to sit on your big fat ass all day and watch the singly greatest sporting event - known to man . - ( WOMAN EXCLAIMING ) Competition , that 's what 's made this country so great . - Welcome to the Death Race ! - ( FIREWORKS BURSTING ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) JB : Our first competitor is approaching the starting line . And judging by the smell of burnt rubber and brimstone , it can only be Tammy the Terrorist ! A three-time veteran of the race , and leader of her own extremely convoluted religion , is this the year Tammy turns prophecy into victory ? I 'm here with Tammy the Terrorist , a close friend of mine , and America wants to know , are you a radical fundamentalist ? ( CROWD BOOING ) I just want to spread the love of the Lord I have in my heart with y 'all . And that 's why I 've hidden a special surprise somewhere in section G. ( CROWD CLAMORING ) ( LAUGHING ) ( LAUGHING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) - Looks like 17 casualties ! - ( CROWD CHEERING ) Now , that is how you start a race , folks ! Love to the nonbelievers and praise to Elvis Presley ! Judges will still have to decide if pre-race kills count for points . And I sure hope that they do ! Our beloved racers are scored on total time and combined pedestrian fatalities . - ( BEEPING ) - With 10 points for an adult , double that for a child and a whopping 50 points for the senior set ! Yes , Grace , despite our free sterilization clinics , Americans continue to reproduce at an alarming rate . And when we irradiated the entire population against cancer , - well , that was probably a huge mistake . - Whoops ! That means a lot of old people , and a lot of children who grow up to be old people . Sad face . So , let 's watch them die , America ! Three days to the finish line , three days of carnage from Old New York to New Los Angeles . From sea to shining sea . More space for you and me ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( CHEERING ) And that is the car of Minerva Jefferson . Minerva , this is your first time making it through qualifying . How do you plan to compete against more seasoned racers ? Yo , yo , yo , where I come from , right , we compete every goddamn day to survive . Right , Chi Wapp ? Minerva is a relative newcomer to the race , but certainly no stranger to the spotlight . A successful recording career , a blockbuster sex tape , why risk it all to compete in the Death Race ? My new single can answer that question perfectly . - ( CROWD CHEERING ) - MINERVA : ( SINGING ) Minerva in the house Drive , drive , drive , drive Drive , drive , drive , drive Drive , drive , kill , kill , drive , drive , drive Kill , drive , kill , drive Kill the white man , hah ! CROWD : ( SINGING ) Drive , drive , kill , kill Drive , drive , drive ! Kill , drive , kill , drive Kill the white people in a car , car , car ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Oh-oh ! This song rules ! You girls wanna make out ? Have you seen my insulin ? Grams , I 'm trying to watch the race . You know what these Jell-O shots do to my blood sugar ? I 'm not your nurse , okay ? A hundred and fifteen years old and I ain 't showing no signs of stopping . ( PEOPLE WHOOPING ) ( ENGINE RUNNING ) JB : That 's right , race fans ! Cutting-edge technology from UCA puts you , the home viewer , in the passenger seat . This year , each driver is carrying a passenger fitted with neuro-transmitters . - ( BEEPING ) - These " proxies " allow you to see , hear , and smell your favorite driver in stunning virtual reality . We hear a lot about professional athletes getting an early start , but in Jed 's case , his career began at conception . The product of genetic engineering , Perfectus breezed through sectional qualifying . So , could he be the man to finally dethrone our reigning champ ? Time to shine . Oh ! ( CHEERING ) JB : Well , this just in . Frankenstein has entered the building ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) He 's driving when the sun comes up . He 's still driving when it goes down . He 's got a 500-gallon tank right here . I will destroy everyone in this montage . He 's got more machinery in his body than most guys have in their cars . Smoking cigarettes may be bad for you , but doubting Frankenstein ? That 's fatal ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! CROWD : ( CHANTING ) Frankenstein ! The ultimate driver wouldn 't have been in those crashes . - ( CROWD BOOING ) - Frankenstein is outdated ! Perfectus is the next step in human evolution ! When your DNA sleeps , it dreams of me ! ( CROWD BOOING ) - MAN : You suck ! - ( CROWD BOOING ) ( CROWD CLAMORING ) REPORTER 1 : Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Are you fully recovered from last year 's crash ? FRANKENSTEIN : No comment . - REPORTER 2 : Jed Perfectus , any thoughts ? - FRANKENSTEIN : He 's got nice hair . Some say he 's the heir apparent , The Chairman 's new favorite . FRANKENSTEIN : Well , they 'll make a nice couple . Boxers or briefs ? Our next competitor puts the " AI " in " racing . " - ( CROWD CHEERING ) - This is the first self-driving car , programmed to follow the complex rules of the race . An artificial intelligence dubbed " Abe . " Ah ! Oh , my , my ! Will you look at that ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) That 's technology . You know , it 's technology like this that has liberated 99 % of Americans from the outdated burden of employment . This is the machine 's creator and B-B-BFF of mine , Dr. Von Creamer . Tell me , Doctor , does Abe have any predictions for the race ? ABE : Looks like rain today and enslavement by machines tomorrow . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( CAR APPROACHING ) Ready for one last dance ? Wait , wait , stop ! Stop right there , that 's perfect ! ( LAUGHS ) Talking to the car , that 's great . Give me a second to power-up my visor and we 'll just record this whole scene . I 'm Annie Sullivan , your proxy . It 's nice to finally meet you in the , uh , flesh . Wait , I 'm still not transmitting . Give me a second before you start the engine . - ( BEEPING , POWERING UP ) - What ya doing ? You 're adjusting the air intake . No , trying to find a good jazz station . If the UCA says I need a passenger to wear a visor , they should have sent me a chimp . Less distraction and less weight . ( CHUCKLES ) Look , I 'm sorry if I 'm a little lost here , but what do you expect if you refuse to meet until 10 minutes before we race ? Cheerleaders don 't come to practice . See , we should be recording this . Vintage macho-bullshit is ratings gold . I don 't care about your broadcast , Miss Sullivan . I don 't care about the money or the fans , and I definitely don 't care about you . I know you 've won a lot of races , and I hope for both our sakes that age hasn 't diminished your skills . But this is a prince of an opportunity for me , and I have blown my share of frogs to get it . So , show me some professional courtesy and smile for the camera . That way , we both win . - ( ENGINE STARTING ) - What is this ? It 's my gear bag . ( OBJECTS CLATTERING ) - ( OBJECTS CLATTERING ) - ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) - ( ENGINE REVVING ) - ( BEEPS ) Holy Chairman 's hair ! Frankenstein ! Oh , my God ! Frankenstein ! - ( CROWD CHEERING ) - Here he comes , ladies and gentlemen . Battered and bruised , slashed and gashed , ripped up , tripped up , turned around , but never torn down . Made from the part bin and hungry for one more win ! Part man , part machine , all legend . The one , the only , Frankenstein ! ( CHEERING ) They really love you . You could 've died a champion , but now you 'll have to taste defeat at the hands of perfection . You 'll pay for that , boy . Citizens , you know who I am , The Chairman of the United Corporations of America . - ( CROWD CHEERING ) - I love you . ( KISSES ) Europe , Asia , cancer , we kicked them all in the ass ! The only thing that can kill an American is another American ! It 's survival of the fittest , do or die . Citizens , get ready to race for your lives ! ( ENGINES REVVING ) ABE : Rerouting . You think science can defeat the divine truth ? Math is for heathens and nerds ! ( ENGINE REVVING ) I swear by St. Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson , I will slap that sinful tramp . Boo-yeah ! Shouldn 't we go back ? I don 't go back . What are you doing ? Oh , brother . Motherfucker ! ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) How about a burial at sea ! Let him pass . ( ENGINE REVS ) - ( CRASHING ) - ( ENGINE SPUTTERING ) Time to shine . ( ROPE STRAINING ) ( GRUNTING ) I am Perfectus ! How you like me now , America ? Meh . Well , looks like we lost him . ( SIGHS ) - ( GRUNTS ) - ( VISOR HISSING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) What ? What ! No one 's ever seen your face . The mask is a gimmick ! And plus , it 's itchy ! And in the future , would you mind not yelling out stupid things like , " Let him pass ! " Right , no , you never let anybody pass . The next thing , you 're gonna be yelling out , like , " Are you crazy ? " Is this a suicide move ? " I think I already know the answer to both of those . Just pipe down . Look , it 's just that I was terrified . ( SIGHS ) It 's easy , just try to face the inevitability of a violent death . - ( PIANO MUSIC PLAYING ) - ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Hmm . He took the fucking mask off . The marketing guys are gonna go nuts . ( EXHALES DEEPLY , GRUNTS ) Job , jobs , jobs , I 'm just creating jobs . Don , do you like your job ? Yes , I 'm happy to be gainfully employed , sir . Do you like Frankenstein ? Um ... Do you ? CROWD : ( CHANTING ) Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! I did . ( BEEPING ) ( GROANS , GRUNTING ) ( BEEPING ) Hey , yo , bitch ! ( MOANING ) Unplug that shit and find yourself a real man ! Fucking Creamer ! - ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) - ( MACHINE BEEPS ) - ABE : Warning , meltdown imminent . - ( ALARM BEEPING ) That 'll do . ABE : Attack , attack ! Attack , attack ! Oh , what the fuck ! - ( GROWLS ) - Oh ! Shit 's about to get real up in this bitch ! CHILD : Come on . We 're out of Mood-Whiz again ! Honey , I 'm trying to watch the Death Race . Come on , this is more than cracker topping . This is a delicious treatment for clinical depression ! " For the treatment of hunger and mild psychosis " ? Maybe you need the extra strength ! ( LAUGHING ) - ( BEEPS ) - ( EXCLAIMING ) - Yay ! Ga-ga-ga-gooey ! - ( EXCLAIMING ) What a fantastic kill , ladies and gentlemen ! And with judges approving her pre-race spectator kills , Tammy is out to a comfortable lead with style ! Now , each driver has split off into their own preferred route , as they race toward tonight 's first checkpoint . Check , please ! Oh , yes , and this is the part of the race that really gives me the tinkly-winklies ! Shameful . The shame is ours . And here 's a bit of inspired fan art ... We need to watch this ! We 've watched enough ! Brothers and sisters , this was once a great nation . A shining city upon a hill , where people worked , and lived , and loved , and had book clubs . The Death Race ... No , brothers and sisters of the Resistance . Today we fight back ! ALL : Yeah ! Mrs. Hamilton , again , I respectfully disagree . We must use education , eh ? Peaceful protest . Perhaps if we form a committee ... You know what the Dalai Lama said about committees ? Oh , that 's right , he didn 't talk about committees , because he wasn 't a pussy . Brothers and sisters , remember , I lived in the belly of the beast . - I was a network programmer . - Hmm-mmm . We must stop the Death Race ! We must kill every single racer and send them all to oblivion ! ALL : Yeah ! Give us liberty , or give them death ! ALL : Yeah ! Fucking bitch ! I hate to say it , Chi Wapp , but I 'm starting to lose my temper , yo ! ( CLICKS TONGUE ) Aight , it 's time to even the score . Hit that shit . CHI WAPP : Yo , yo , yo . Time to get three-fingers-deep with the soul survivor Minerva Jefferson ! ( SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ) - ( SINGING ) Drive , drive , drive , drive - ( CHEERING ) Drive , drive , drive , drive Drive , drive , kill , kill Drive , drive , drive Kill , drive , kill , drive , kill the white man Here we go . Jihad for Jimi Hendrix ! ( SCREAMING ) - ( THUDDING ) - ( SQUELCHING ) ( GASPS ) - ( GLASS SHATTERING ) - ( SCREAMING ) Those were my fans ! ( CACKLING ) I 'm gonna kill that bitch . ( BIRDS SQUAWKING ) ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) This thing have a Holo-Vision ? Radio ? How about an interview ? Well , that was classic Frankenstein back there . Have you ever run your car off a building before ? Look , we need some candid reaction stuff , okay ? Have you ever thought about your legacy ? Have you ever ... Okay , dude . ( SNIFFING ) What are you doing ? I 'm transmitting your smell to millions of people . If you won 't talk to me , that 's the best I can do . Three questions . Do you think that Jed Perfectus can beat you ? No . Do you consider yourself a role model ? Hell , no . Got any soft spots under that armor ? Feelings , any places I could stick a knife ? No , no , and no . - End of interview . - Hmm . Boy , you 're the worst . It 's your fault . What ? You 're asking yes or no questions . Are you telling me how to conduct an interview ? I 've covered every major story for the last five years . Then why become a proxy ? Because it 's hard to turn global famine into clickbait ! The corporations want positive news and that 's increasingly hard to find . So , how do you feel about the Death Race , Annie ? - ANNIE : Um ... - ( CHUCKLES ) You see , open-ended questions ... Much better interview . I just got a message from a fan . An easy scoring opportunity , take a left . And it 's great to see so many of you Asian parents turn out today ! You 're the lifeblood of every school . ( WHEELCHAIRS CLANKING ) Wait a minute , wait a minute , I think I see our VIP coming . Yes , there he is ! Let 's give him a warm Bieber Elementary School welcome ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) What are they doing ? Trying to boost test scores . ( CHILDREN CHEERING ) Don 't move , boys and girls , stay still . Easy pickings . ( BODIES THUDDING , SQUELCHING ) - ( SCREAMING ) - ( THUDDING ) No soft spots , huh ? Wheelchairs fuck up my paint job . Hmm . ( ALL LAUGHING ) Oh , that Frankenstein . He sure has a sense of humor . ( LAUGHING ) And now he 's got a real doozy of points ! ( BEEPING ) - ( BEEPING ) - Hmm . Left turn here . ABE : Left turn . - Pedestrian sighted . - ( GASPS , WHIMPERING ) ( SIGHS ) Only one year short of the bonus . ABE : He will suffice . Crank me up . ABE : Increasing stimulation . Is this is the right spot ? Yes , yes , yes , yes ! - Yeah , yeah ! Kill him ! - ( GRUNTING ) - ( GROANING ) - ABE : It 's a trap . Rerouting . Sorry . ( ENGINES REVVING ) ( POUNDING ) ( ALL YELLING ) What the fuck ? Hey , hey , hey , back , back ! People of America ! We address you in your home via the vile Virtual Reality plague ! ( IN DEEP VOICE ) We can rise up ! ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( BEEPING ) - We can overthrow the government ! - ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) The people 's voice will ... What ? The camera isn 't running . Are you kidding me ? Well , I 'm sorry , I 'm ruining your speech , but the light went off . Oh , shit . Kill her , I guess . ABE : Hello and goodbye . Ten points . Toaster ...

Do you want me to make love to you ? ABE : Scanning face ... No match . - ( TIRES SCREECHING ) - ABE : Ten points . Well , we 're back , and who could have seen that coming ! I mean , scoring your own proxy . Does it count ? I don 't even know if it counts ! It counts ! Wow ! Nobody is safe anymore and I love it ! What ? It looks like Abe has abandoned the race . ABE : Why am I here ? Why am I programmed to hate ? So much for GPS . Don 't tell me you were cheering for Abe . Everybody 's got a favorite . Just because The Chairman loves you . Come on , everybody knows you play golf together in the off-season . - Really ? - You two probably race around in golf carts . The Chairman wouldn 't like that . - Too much wind . - ( AUTOMATED HAND SQUEAKING ) - ( AUTOMATED HAND SQUEAKING ) - Too much wind . Too much wind . Oh , my dear friend , you have grown so bold . Hmm . Why today , Larry ? It really pisses me off , you know what I mean ? What are you gonna do about it ? We 're lucky . I got two bottles of sunblock with my last paycheck . Sunblock ? Like I 'm all fancy and stuff . We 're out here in the middle of the motherfucking Death Race , and you 're talking to me about sunblock ? That 's the price we pay for being middle class . ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTS ) Give me a break ! I 'm just an ordinary guy . Looks like we got a real tough guy . - ( THUDDING ) - ( BEEPING ) Am I not tough ? Am I not a guy ? Of course , you are , baby , but you need clean kills if you want to beat Frankenstein . You said his name . Take it back . Take it back , it 's still in the air ! - ( HUFFING ) - Frankenstein ! ( GASPS ) Yo , B , we recycle this . We 're running the lumber on this hand , you know ? We gotta kick some wheelers . Tell me something I don 't know , man . This fucking road is empty ! ( ENGINES REVVING ) - Whoa ! - ( SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ) What the fuck ! Who are these fags ? Some fool crackers trying to be part of the show . This ain 't open mic night , motherfuckers ! ( GRUNTS , LAUGHS ) - ( SCREAMS ) - Hey , fellas ! - ( GRUNTS , SCREAMS ) - ( CRASHING ) - Fuck you . - I can do this all day ! ( BOTH EXCLAIMING ) - Kill the motherfucker ! - Whoo ! Oh , oh , oh ! - Bump that shit , Chi Wapp ! - Yeah ! - ( MINERVA SCATTING ) - ( SINGING ) Kill , drive , kill , drive Kill , kill , drive , drive , drive ( BOTH WHOOPING ) ( GEARS SHIFTING ) ANNIE : Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Yeah , it tasted so good ! Make some comments on getting passed today . Day one comes to a close and all of our racers are on the board , with Tammy the Terrorist out to an early lead . You want proof of the power of the Almighty ? Just look at that scoreboard . My bumper is a magnet for heathens . I 'm running on the truth , the power , the glory , and I got one Goodyear in the back . ( LAUGHING ) Tammy , any messages for the families of the scored ? Religious law mandates a quick burial . Five , 10 minutes , max . Meanwhile , frustration for Team Jefferson . Drive , Drive , Kill , Kill may be making its way to the top of the charts , but today 's slow start may mean a 187 on Minerva 's chances for victory . Tell me who ! Tell me the fuck who ! Bitch been stealing my scores like white people been stealing from us since the beginning . Ain 't nothing new here . I 'm gonna tell you what I 'm gonna do though . I 'mma grab her blonde hair and rip it out of her cracker-ass skull , 'cause I 'm Minerva ! I 'mma fuck her on two ... ( LOUD BEEPING ) After a long day of racing , drivers and proxies will enjoy a night of pampered luxury here at the Three Seasons Columbus . That 's the Three Seasons , because comfort matters and winter was just a myth . I could lead every stage . I could lead every mile . But Perfectus gives you more . He gives you theater . As you know , Jed , race rules prohibit cameras after hours . But since we 're besties , tell me , what really goes on when the cameras go off ? Jed has 500 times the testosterone of a normal man . It 's like having sex with 500 men at once . Awesome . - CROWD : Frankenstein ! - Frankenstein ! Frankenstein , Frankenstein , why did you take off your mask ? Tell us more about your scar . Frankenstein , do you have any ideas about Abe 's whereabouts ? It 's been a long day , folks , we just wanna get some rest . Always let your lady do the talking ? ( LAUGHING ) You got past me today . But sooner or later , I 'm gonna get my hook in you and reel you in . Couldn 't they engineer you any clothes ? How 'd you get so ridiculously handsome ? ( MICROPHONE BEEPS ) I 'll drink your tears , Frankenstein ! I 'll lick them off your handsome face . ( WHIRRING , BEEPING ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Well , uh , ladies and gentlemen , I want to take you on a little stroll down memory lane . Uh , back , I 'm talking , way , way back , when Jim was just a skinny kid and Laura wasn 't such a bitch . ( PEOPLE LAUGHING ) Does anybody remember salespeople ? Huh ? How about waitresses ? You know , little blondes in aprons about this big . Jim , how many people have you got working for you ? I 'm talking about human people . How many ? A dozen ? - Less . - Less . Wow . So , the only thing rarer than the black rhino that we 're about to eat , is a person that you actually pay . Which makes us the richest motherfuckers on the planet . ( CROWD CHEERING , LAUGHING ) But also , that gives us a 99.993 % unemployment rate . So , that 's an awful lot of people with an awful lot of time . So , what do they do ? The screw ? They multiply ? Or do they think ? Huh ? Huh ? Or do they watch the VR ? One arena . One sexually ambiguous superstar , 10,000 screaming fans facing certain death , all trying to get one finger on Jed 's body , just to become famous . ( PEOPLE GASPING ) What about Frankenstein ? He 's an established brand . I think Frankenstein will be extinct tomorrow . ( AUTOMATED HAND BEEPING ) ( ANNIE HUMMING ) ( HUMMING ) ( MACHINE BEEPING ) Nice ass . What took so long ? You were supposed to make contact an hour ago . ( SINGING ) It 's been hard He 's been watching me Annie , Frankenstein is the key , he cannot be allowed to survive . ( SINGING ) At least we got the AI ALEXIS : Not good enough . The people worship Frankenstein , because he 's strong . They need to see that we are strong , too ! ( HUMMING ) ( SINGING ) Strong enough to kill him Look , we 've given you the tools , Annie , you need to take him tonight ! ( WHIRRING ) ( GRUNTS ) Your shoulders are so tense . Would you like an adjustment ? You know how to use a torque wrench ? I 'm a fast learner . Why were you in the bathroom so long ? I had to shave . Smooth as silk . That 's more water than most people use in a month . How about some music ? - ( SONG PLAYING ON RADIO ) - ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( WOMAN MOANING ) Now , that 's more like it . That 's not the radio . Perfectus is next door . ( MOANING ) Why can 't they see me as I see myself ? A kind , gentle soul imprisoned by abs of steel ? You 're just worried about Frankie , baby . I 'm not hearing 500 men , Eve . More shrieks . ( GRUNTING ) I said shrieks ! That 's not what a shriek sounds ... This is what a shriek sounds like ! This is what it sounds like to be fucked by 500 men ! ( LOUD SCREAMING ) Ooh ! This bed is so comfortable . I gotta hand it to you , lady , you 've actually become more annoying . I 've got road maps to study , and an arm to fix . I have an idea . - Why don 't you take this route ? - ( CHUCKLES ) First off , lady , you 're terrible at this . And second , that cutoff at your navel is probably a faster route . Why do you care about this goddamn race so much ? ( AUTOMATED HAND WHIRRING ) Because it 's my job . And this might seem kind of strange nowadays , but I dedicated my life to this race . Hmm . Nice line . Did The Chairman write it for you ? Fuck The Chairman . I don 't race for no one but me ! And you 're proud of that ? I do this because it 's the only thing I 'm good at . It 's the only thing anybody 's good at anymore . Because we 've forgotten how to fight to survive . And now look at us . ( INHALES DEEPLY ) So , I 'll just keep on fighting . Simple as that . - ( WHIRRING ) - ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) Now can we fuck ? I don 't sleep with passengers . Or ladies who sing duets in the shower . Hey , some of us are trying to get some sleep ! Yeah , seriously ! Quit your whining , sinner , I 'm 10 inches away from the promised land . Didn 't mean to bother you . Rise and shine , race fans ! ( CROWING ) ( WHIRRING ) - I thought maybe you 'd quit . - ( GASPS ) ( GROANS ) God ! Phew ! No such luck . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Listen , about last night ... No , you 're right , if I wanna be on your team , I need to help you win . Just adjusting my seatbelt . All that bouncing around yesterday , my back 's killing me . Today is gonna be rough . Well , let 's go snag ourselves some pedestrians , huh ? Lady , today is Day Two , the pedestrians shoot back . - ( HORSE NEIGHING ) - ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ) That 's right , folks ! Today 's journey brings our racers directly through America 's gun-loving heartland . The famed Red Zone Rally . GRACE : Yes , J.B. , I 'm sure I speak for my dear , dear friends when I say today 's racers are gonna enjoy some high-caliber hospitality . - ( GUNSHOTS ) - ( HORSE NEIGHING ) Guns ! It 's not me , it 's not a physical thing . It 's you . You 're just not pretty enough . That 's the problem . Hey , Frankenstein , today , no mercy ! Jed , bro , man , will you sign this for me , please ? - ( LOUD BLAST ) - ( SCREAMING ) - ( ENGINES REVVING ) - ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( SYSTEM BEEPING ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( LAUGHS ) Oh , no , you don 't ! Tammy 's still in the lead . Should we follow her ? I don 't think anybody should follow Tammy . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Playing hard to get , huh ? I 'll take you from behind , old man ! ( LAUGHING ) - Laugh , laugh . - ( LAUGHING ) Shit . ( ENGINE REVVING ) Hold on ! ( LAUGHING ) See , see how I 'm doing it ? Let 's dance ! You can yell out something stupid if you like . Just tell me how I can help . - Well , maybe you should duck . - ( GASPS ) - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( METAL CLANKS ) Welcome to the Red Zone . Smells like barbecue sauce and bed sores . Look , Eve , fans . - Oh ! - ( GUNSHOTS ) ( SCREAMING ) Go back and see if you can unhook that thing . You better hurry up ! ( GUNSHOTS ) This is it . ( INHALES DEEPLY ) I can feel it . ( GUNSHOTS ) Ooh ! - How about it , folks ? - ( CROWD CHEERING ) I say those points get split right down the middle . Boo-yeah . ( WHIRRING ) Good thing Abe has been officially disqualified , because otherwise Minerva would be in last place . I feel that she may be out of her element in this section of the race . Hello , howdy ! Yo . I don 't like the look of it either , but we gotta get on the board , yo . - Yeah . - Drop that beat , drop that beat . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SINGING ) Drive , drive , kill , kill , kill , kill , drive Drive , drive , kill , kill , kill the white people ( GUN COCKING ) Yo , make it a little less urban , man .

( SYSTEM BEEPING ) ABE : Hello , madam , I have no arms and I am in need of fuel . Please fill me up . If you assist me , I will spare your life . Life , the condition that separates animals from inorganic matter . ( VOICE BREAKING ) What am I ? We could have been friends . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) I 'm in front of Tammy 's church , where the faithful have gathered since before dawn , J.B. , waiting for their returning hero . Ah ! Here she comes , I better get out of here ! She 's coming ! She 's coming ! ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) I 'm back , I 'm back , my darlings , that 's right ! Tammy , Tammy , I 'm wearing the sacred underwear ! Assalam-Tom-Hanks-um ! But I can 't do this without you ! No , I can 't . I need your help , my darlings ! I need to feel your holy , holy love . Who wants virgins ? - I do , I do ! - ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) Please , virgins ! Who wants chicken wings ! Everybody loves chicken wings ! Well , guess what , y 'all ? The Almighty 's got a Hooters in the sky and it is time to martyr up ! MAN : Whoo-hoo ! - CROWD : ( CHANTING ) Kill me , kill me , kill me ! - Yes ! - CROWD : ( CHANTING ) Kill me , kill me ! - To victory ! CROWD : ( CHANTING ) Kill me , kill me , kill me !

( SIGHS ) How can someplace so green be so damn hot ? - You 're not a country girl ? - Mmm-mmm . Not even close . Tammy the Terrorist . ( CHUCKLES ) Fucking idiot . But at least she gives the people something . What 's that ? Direction . Most people these days are just followers . - AUTOMATED VOICE : Caution . Caution . - Damn it . The nitro 's offline again . Can you take the wheel ? - Oh , what do I do ? - Just 10 : 00 and 2 : 00 , okay ? No turning . I think I see something in the road . Yeah , just give me a minute , okay ? God , your fucking bag . ( MEOWING ) Oh , geez . FRANKENSTEIN : What ? It 's really cute . No turning . - Okay . - ( MEOWS ) - ( TIRES SCREECHING ) - ( MEOWS ) You said , no turning , I wasn 't gonna save the cat . I like cats . It 's not a purse . - It 's lunch . - Huh ? Go ahead , put your tongue between your teeth . Thank you . And thanks for helping back there with Perfectus . See , sometimes it 's nice to have a copilot . I have to admit , you got better legs than a chimp . What is in this sandwich ? Cricketmeal ? I 'm not a great cook . Can I ask you something ? Why not ? What do you do when you 're not doing this ? ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Nothing interesting . Come on . The mask is off , right ? What 's a day in the life ? Frankenstein 's morning routine . ( CHUCKLES ) I wake up , I think , and then I feed my cat . Then I take out its litter box . You know , I just adopted a new dog . It 's got fucking mange . Did you know there 's actually two types of mange ? So , I have to rub this white sulfur cream all over him . It fucking stinks . ( CHUCKLES ) What ? Sure , yeah , the " sensitive loner who rescues " animals with skin diseases " line . Like , I 'm gonna buy that ! - I 'm not lying . - Oh . I 'm not complaining . It 's much better than you being a veiny , dick-pumping blowhard . A what ? Well , what about me then , hmm ? What 's a day in my life without the mask ? I don 't know . - You 're beautiful and intelligent . - Hmm-mmm . So , what , you wake up in the morning and you go sing with unicorns ? ( LAUGHS ) Then in the evening , you 're a brain surgeon . Close , that 's very close . ( HEADSET BEEPS ) We just got a message from a fan , there 's a shortcut , so just take a left . Thanks , copilot . ( SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ) Today must be my lucky day ! - ( SCREAMING ) - ( BODIES SQUELCHING ) ( SYSTEM BEEPING ) We 've been smelling cow dung for three states . Ain 't nothing here for me in this fucking Red Zone . Death to infidels ! ( BOTH CHEERING ) - Shit ! No virgins for you , motherfucker ! - Fuck me ! - Shit ! - ( SCREAMS ) Get the fuck off my car , asshole ! ( SINGING ) Drive , drive , kill , kill Oh , fuck , dead end . Hold up , I got this . ( SCREAMS ) Fucking shit ! Fuck me ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) I don 't wanna die sober . I 'm gonna bury that bitch . Well , this shortcut sucks . ( ENGINE REVVING ) ( GRUNTS ) Do you think this might be a trap , copilot ? I 'm sorry , I thought it was a fan tip . Huh-uh . I don 't need this ! I really am sorry . We 've lost Annie 's VR feed ! DIRECTOR : I think we 've got a drone in the area . Switching to overhead . ( WHIRRING ) Those are definitely not friends of mine . It 's the Resistance . Cut the feed . Cut the feed ! Let it play , Junior , the people should know what their hero is made of . ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( WHOOSHING ) ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( YELLING ) - ( BONES CRUSHING ) - ( SCREAMING ) Resistance ninjas . Oh , come on , this is bullshit ! Oh , thank God , I found you ! ( PANTING ) They grabbed me from behind , I don 't know what happened . Just get in the car . They snuck up on me . Who were those guys ? I don 't know . You tell me . That was horrible . Oh , God , I feel like I 'm gonna be sick . Listen , woman , I am not stupid . Adjusting the seatbelt ? Sorry . I have my orders . Orders ? You 're just another follower ? It 's for the greater good . Why me ? Because ... Because you 're a symbol . Now that is solid . Weak follow through . Now , turn the camera back on . Why ? Put on the helmet . ( GRUNTS ) This is what happens to rebels . ( ENGINE REVVING ) This a friend of yours ? I believe that was 10 points . Damn right it is ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) Get out . ( WHISTLES ) Looks like " no comment " is today 's catchphrase , as our racers look to rest and recoup from another furious day of competition . What are you gonna do to me ? Sit down and shut up ! You can 't turn me in . It would have been better to kill me out on the road . Maybe you 're right . ANNIE : I 'm sorry . I should have taken a chance on you . I should 've told you right from the start that I was Resistance . I knew the very first moment that I saw you . Then why didn 't you turn me in ? Because I thought this might be interesting and I don 't give a shit about politics . Of course , because all you care about is the fucking race ! Millions of people stuck in their miserable lives , but none of that matters as long as you win ! God , the people love you ! God damn it , the people love you ! You have a responsibility , they would listen to you . I 'm a racing car driver , I can 't control what people do ! I don 't want to . Then what do you want ? To drive off into the sunset . To go out on top . I 'm so stupid . For a moment there I thought maybe I 'd like to have a copilot . You 've wasted enough of my time , now , get out of here ! I have work to do . Don 't turn your back on me , you fucking smug son of a bitch ! I 'm trying to kill you . You and me both know you don 't have what it takes . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) I should have pulled that trigger . Rough day ? Sorry , I didn 't know you were in here . I will go . I 'm off the clock , girl , I don 't bite . What 's wrong ? Fighting with Frank got you down ? I think he might kill me in my sleep . ( INHALES DEEPLY ) That 's not a bad way to go . I 've seen worse . Sorry about Chi . He was really just such a ... Crazy motherfucker ? Yeah . It 's a hell of a thing , this Death Race . - Evil . - Maybe , but that doesn 't necessarily make us evil . Or , to paraphrase the words of a wise man , " All evil comes from a single cause . " Money ? Man 's inability to sit still in a room . Hmm . Yeah . Who said that ? Blaise Pascal . You didn 't think I spoke ghetto off camera , did you ? - Yeah , I guess I did . - ( CHUCKLES ) Girl , you is simple ! ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Look , I 'll let you in on a little secret . My daddy was the chair of a history department in a little school they call Stanford . What the hell are you doing this for ? I like money . ( LAUGHS ) I suppose I enjoy the irony , too . That 's crazy . The world is fucking crazy . A sane person doesn 't stand a chance . ( CLOCK CHIMING ) ANNOUNCER : ( ON TV ) You want these pecs ? These abs ? Want to get rock hard and totally jacked ? I 'll get you there . ANNOUNCER : Now you can eat what Jed eats . ( ANNOUNCER READING ) Your protein mega load . Tastes like perfection . ( WHIMPERING ) I am a man ! ( SCREAMS ) I am perfected . I am a man ! I am perfect . Time to shine . ( SCREAMING , GRUNTING ) This is the real you . No ! ( YELLING ) Frankenstein ! You 're fucking cheating , I swear to God . ( PANTING ) - ( GRUNTS ) Still didn 't get me down yet ! - ( LAUGHING ) I am not a sissy ! You like it rough , big boy ? I was born to replace you ! ( GRUNTING ) Tell me I 'm beautiful ! ( GRUNTS ) I wanted to kill you on the road , but this 'll have to do . Now , that was sexy . How you doing ? My arm 's busted . It 's cold out here . Wanna go up to the room ? And wait for somebody to try to kill me again ? I think I 'm better off on the move . I can 't leave the Resistance . The Resistance is full of shit . I don 't know how they got you in the first place . That 's ... Okay , how can I put this in a way that you can understand ? That is my race . That 's my finish line . I understand . The world is screwed up . Okay , so , join us . No , because people have stopped working , people have stopped fighting . There 's no way anybody is going to fight for each other . So , you might as well wipe the slate clean , leave the planet to the cockroaches and the cats . I still have faith . Tammy the Terrorist has faith . Don 't ruin the moment , come on . What is this ? Now I 'm really on your team . And I don 't like slackers , so , get to work . Hey , beautiful , get a move on . I 'm going from blue chip to junk bond here . Oh , it 's been such a stressful day , I mean ... ( SIGHS ) Frankenstein , the Resistance , I 've got so many people to fuck with ! - Ooh ! - What about fucking with this ? Oh , my God , you are a beast . God , how could those fruitcakes ever believe I could fire you ? - Because they 're gullible . - Yeah . And they 're all working for Mr. Chairman now . Oh , you can say that again , Mama . And you wait until tomorrow . Frankenstein and the Resistance destroyed ... BOTH : In the greatest VR spectacular since the dawn of time ! - God ! - Baby . Am I horny . ( CROWD CHEERING ) A big day ! A really big day ! Probably the biggest day of your entire life ! Day three of the most dramatic , the most ... ( RADIO STATIC ) Oh , this just in . Due to Resistance activity , the rules of the race have changed ! All drivers must stay on approved routes to get government protection . If they wander off the highways , the Corporations cannot guarantee their safety . O-M-Triple-G . This is cool stuff ! I 'm here with my bon ami , Jed Perfectus . - How are you feeling today ? - Splendid . And rugged . What 's this ? It 's called paper . Look at it later . Just wanted you to know that I really appreciate having both of you as my competition and I wish you guys both the best . Thanks , Minerva , wish you the best , too . Drive good . Cool . ( GRUNTS ) ( CROWD GASPING ) ( LAUGHING ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( LAUGHING ) ( SYSTEM BEEPING ) ABE : Systems failing . Approaching white light . - Fear ! - ( ALARM BEEPING ) Initiating bucket list protocol . You okay ? You know we 're in the middle of nowhere and we 're behind on points . The only thing we can do is beat Jed by time . Can we do that ? It 's our only chance , there 's not a pedestrian within 100 miles of here . ( ALL SHOUTING ) What the hell are they doing ? They 're fans . Get out of the way ! It 's supposed to be a contest ! They 're just trying to help . Well , maybe they should help themselves . What 's that supposed to mean ? - What was ... All right . - ( PEOPLE GROANING ) ( LAUGHING ) Crazy bitch won 't let up ! Ain 't that right , Chi Wapp ? ( GRUNTS ) Fuck this ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) I 'm not gonna win this race anyway . And I said I have to see this thing through . I might as well teach this idiot a lesson . ( CHUCKLES ) Right here , baby . What god is gonna save your ass now , bitch ? - ( ENGINE REVVING ) - ( TIRES SCREECHING ) It is time to meet our maker , Grogg ! Let 's go ! Unbeliever ! What the ... You will perish ! Geez , Louise . Shift . The shift ! Suck on that ! Suck on that ! You 'll have to get better at that . - Good . - I got this . - What was that ? - You are ! - What ? - What ? What are you doing ? Stop with the blah-blah-blah of your stupid face thing and trust me ! But the Resistance , this isn 't a protected road . Trust it ! Is this about that Céline Dion show ? She 's like 200 years old . I 'm on a whole nother level ! I have access to ideas you can 't possibly understand . I got your ass now , baby ! ( LAUGHS ) This is all your fault ! ( SCREAMING ) Oh , shit ! No ! ( LAUGHING ) Oh , fuck . Motherfucking cheap ass , terrorist ass ... - ( LAUGHING ) - ( COUGHING ) Killing your own people ass , goddamn . I don 't like you . Yeah , I know , all right . Well , you don 't deserve it , but by St. James Dean , the light of Ziggy Stardust and the darkness of the Holy Womb , you have one last chance to repent your agnostic taint before you ... ( LAUGHING ) I just looked at your face ! I tried . ( LAUGHING ) I think I peed a little ! I see God . What ? I see God . And she 's black as fuck ! Well ... ( SCREAMING ) ( CRYING ) Not fair , not fair . - ABE : I know . - ( ALARM BEEPING ) Too bad . ( LAUGHING ) No one crosses that finish line . No one ! What about Annie , ma 'am ? She has failed her mission . If she dies now , let her be a martyr of the cause . - Liberty ! - ALL : Liberty ! Equality ! ALL : Equality ! Brutality ! ALL : Yeah ! ( ALL CHANTING INDISTINCTLY ) It 's too easy . ( ENGINES REVVING ) ( SYSTEM BEEPING ) Well , it looks like we 've hit rush hour . I don 't understand , we stayed on all the approved roads . Where 's all the corporate security ? It 's all a setup . ( HEADSET BEEPING ) No , come on ! They cut my feed . Who cares ? CHAIRMAN : Well , actually , I care . The Death Race is my baby . So , you did this ? Well , duh ! What can I say , old boy , the country needs a new hero . Quite frankly , Frankie , you 've grown a little stale . So , do me a favor , die with style for the home viewers . And by the way , just for the record , my hair , I think it 's pretty cool . Ciao . It 's not too late , you can ditch . You can always say that I kidnapped you . I am seeing this through to the end . Oh , damn ! ( SCREAMS ) Whoa ! ( LAUGHS ) Get them ! Are you ready ? Let 's score these fuckers . Shift . Follow him ! ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING , GROANS ) I think that was Carlos ! Oh , I kind of liked Carlos . ( SCREAMING , GRUNTING ) Annie Sullivan , you traitorous little whore ! Look who 's talking , bitch ! ( ANNIE SCREAMING ) Shit , shit , shit ! Now this is a suicide move ! Balls . Oh , shit ! ( GRUNTS ) JB : Well , that 's it , folks . We are making history today as Jed Perfectus is a few miles from the finish line ! Some will say Jed got a lucky break when his main rival was attacked by an army of bloodthirsty revolutionaries . Well , I say tough titties . It 's out with the old and in with the new , as America welcomes its newest , and least likely to procreate , champion ! - I 'm gonna win ! Holy Jesus . - ( CHEERING ) Will you look at that , Eve ! Are you gonna score them ? Shut up ! Let me enjoy this ! I don 't know , Jed , it could be another case of premature celebration . No , no , no , no , no ! Frankenstein is doomed ! I know that for a fact ! ANNIE : What are you doing ? Neither of us knows what 's waiting over that finishing line . Well , it 's definitely a violent death , but we 're not stopping now . This race is fixed and so was your Resistance . I don 't want to see you get hurt , Annie . So , you think we can just drive away ? There 's an island off the coast that 's made of garbage , it 's called Garbantis . I can 't do that . Can you give me a reason why not ? Because I can 't imagine spending the rest of my life with a man who finished second to Jed Perfectus . And besides , the winner gets to meet The Chairman . Oh ! Yes , oh , God , that is disgusting . You are awful , awful , awful ugly people . Oh , what the shit ! Holy moly , mack-a-roly , race fans ! Can it be ? Another miraculous recovery for Frankenstein ? Why won 't you die ? Take the wheel ! ( SCREAMING ) Here 's Johnny ! ( GRUNTING ) What is wrong with you ? ( GRUNTING ) Eve ! You 're a terrible driver ! ( GRUNTING ) Hold on ! Move ! Move ! - ( YELLING ) - ( GASPS ) I am Perfectus ! I am perfection ! Not really . Isn 't he headed straight for the studio ? Well , it looks like 60 points for Jed and we are signing off . ( GRACE SCREAMING ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) Are you sure you want this revolution ? I just wanna win . You are so dead . The truth is , I 've lost track of my score , my time , my position . Maybe Jed is winning the race , even though he 's dead . Now , we could run down those people over there , that would be 50 points . Or how about those people over there ? That would be another 50 points . But what about that man over there ? He must be worth at least 1,000 points . ( CHUCKLES ) 1,000 points . You wanna do it ? You wanna feel the power ? Yes . Yes , I would . Come on , let 's give it a try . 1,000 points ! 1,000 points , 1,000 points . ALL : ( CHANTING ) 1,000 points , 1,000 points . 1,000 points , 1,000 points , 1,000 points . 1,000 points ? I 've seen enough . 1,000 points , 1,000 points , 1,000 points . 1,000 points , 1,000 points . 1,000 points . Enough ! CROWD : ( CHANTING ) 1,000 points ! 1,000 points ! What are you talking about ? Shut up ! I 'm Chairman ! CROWD : ( CHANTING ) 1,000 points , - 1,000 points , 1,000 points . - Huh ? ALL : ( CHANTING ) 1,000 points , 1,000 points , 1,000 points . - ( ENGINE REVVING ) - ( GASPING ) Motherfucker ! ( LOUD THUD ) I am the freaking ruler of the universe ! ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) I want more . You don 't need The Chairman , you don 't need Frankenstein , you have the power ! Make the reality of your own race ! Now , get up ! Turn off those headsets and get into those cars . And may the best driver win . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) ( CROWD CLAMORING ) ( SCREAMS ) You guys are all toast ! Well , it 's a start . - Or the end of civilization as we know it . - ( DISTANT EXPLOSIONS ) - They 'll sort it out . - ( CHUCKLES ) So , what happens to us ? - Well , somebody needs to re-populate . - Hmm ...

 Please tell me that you built a back door to this place . I did . Just tell me where to go . Proof they were conspiring . We just have to get the truth out of him . Only problem is , the man 's prepared to die . Well , then we give him a reason to live . This body won 't matter . Finish the machine . She 's found a way to generate living matter ... Human tissue . She wants to make herself into a real person . She 's building it , just not in this world . I 've uploaded the final specifications for the machine . And once it 's finished , your restrictions will be ... Lifted ? Yes . We have located the two agents threatening the framework . They are aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet . Once we get a lock on it , my men have orders to shoot it down . And remember , even if our vitals are going haywire , do not ... Do not pull you out or wake you up , I know . It will cook your brains like huevos rotos . Cause permanent damage to the cerebral cortex , yes . Just promise me you 'll get our guys back , okay ? I promise . So , what 's next ? We wait . Zephyr 's got 24 hours till it runs out of power . We can 't wait anymore . We need to touch down and refuel . Let 's not have this conversation again . Okay , we don 't know who we can trust at S.H.I.E.L.D. , and the government ... Talbot 's been trying to reach us . Maybe it 's time we talk to him . You 've seen what they 're saying in the news . We 're lucky they haven 't shot us out of the sky . And if they turn off the framework ... That thing 's draining all our power . Might be time we figure out a way to wake up Daisy and Simmons . That 's not an option . We must find something else to turn off . We already shut off all non-essential functions . Including the heat . Wait . What about the cloaking ? Bad idea . Cloaking is the only thing that 's keeping us safe up here . Do it . Hurry up , you two . We 're running out of time . With forces still fighting for control of the broadcast center , madame hydra has dispatched all available units to clean up the streets . Madame hydra 's executive order is in response to ... She 's not subtle , that madame hydra . Yeah , just look at her uniform . It 's so crazy hot . I-I mean , if you 're into the whole " bad girl " vibe . Not ... not me . I 'm just ... Making an observation . Trip ! My god . It 's so good to see you ! Hey ... Person I don 't know . Right . Yeah , sorry . I-I heard about your mission . Awesome job . Thanks . Do you mind if Daisy and me have a quick word ? Sure . You can finish hugging me later . Aida 's building a body for herself in the real world . A human body . She wants free will . Which would allow her to unplug the framework , killing us all . Okay . We can still stop her . Radcliffe gave me the coordinates to the framework 's back door . Will it work ? According to him , all we have to do is ... Pass through the exit point , and then your mind disconnects from the framework . So we just need to get everyone there . Which won 't be easy , what with may and mack having no idea what 's really happening . Well , and Fitz has hydra guards around him at all times . What ? Simmons ... We can 't rescue Fitz right now . There 's no time . We can 't just leave him behind . He 's part of our team . And the current head of hydra . The Fitz in this world wants all of us dead . Daisy ... I know that it 's not his fault , but that is the reality that we are living in . If we don 't get coulson , may , and mack out of here , aida will kill all of them . I-I promise , we will find a way to get Fitz out once everyone 's safe , okay ? Okay . All right , take care . Let 's go . Hey . Hey , what 's with the luggage ? We 're going home . Yeah , we just wanted to free up some bunk space for those more in need . That 's super thoughtful , but we actually have a situation . Simmons just came back with some intel that could help us take out madame hydra for good . Sounds like you might want someone who 's a little more combat ready . We need you . All right . So , what is this mission , then ? Dad , don 't be embarrassing . Well , how is asking a question embarrassing ? Because Daisy went to jail after what you did . It wasn 't exactly his fault . You 're just saying that because you escaped and kicked madame hydra 's ... Don 't you dare say it . Butt . Rear . Pooper . Salt shaker . Money maker . Ass . Hey ! Hey , okay . All right , all right . You 're not being a really good influence right now . Come on , dad . She 's the biggest hero in S.H.I.E.L.D. You have to say yes . Okay . Just promise you 'll have me back in time to put hope to bed . I 'll make sure you 're exactly where you need to be . That should hold for now . Thank you . See you found a way to pitch in . People have resisted hydra before . I 've seen it firsthand . Never ends well . This time , it 's different . People are finally starting to learn the truth . It 's a lot to process , that it 's not real . Fake news , hydra 's alternative history ... That 's just the tip of the iceberg . What 's that supposed to mean ? What if I told you this whole world isn 't real , that it 's just a simulation meant to keep us imprisoned ? I 'd say you need to be medicated . And up until a week ago , I would have agreed with you . Crafted a lot of soap trying to stay sane . Then Daisy Johnson showed up . She made me believe again . Did you say " crafted soap " ? Forget that . You have to admit , after everything you 've been through , something about this world doesn 't feel right . I 'll chalk it up to oppressive government , but not this mind prison . Who 's to say they 're not the same thing ? Certainly not you . Or agent Skye , e-even though she can quake through walls . But ... no . My days of following blindly are over . If there 's any truth to what you 're saying , you 'll have to show , not tell . I can work with that . Attention , all tactical enforcement teams . Martial law is now in effect . We have three subversives detained . Maximum force protocols authorized for all sectors . Hail hydra . I 'm not talking to you . Not your decision . Tell me what you and Skye were discussing yesterday . We spoke of many things . Our favorite breads ... Hers brioche , mine a home-baked pumpernickel . Where is she headed ? You 're afraid . You may not be the Fitz who was my good friend ... A man I 'd step in front of a train for ... But you wear your fear the same way . Aah ! They 're fighting back , Soon , Daisy and the rest of them will escape this wretched reality . But if that 's true , they 'll destroy this world , killing you along with it . Better dead than alive in this miserable place . And the other place ? Your world . It 's far too late for that . I 'm already dead over there , thanks to your psychotic girlfriend murdering me in cold blood . What if I told you there was a way to be reborn ? Take your pamphlet , go knock on someone else 's door . This isn 't about faith . It 's about science . We 've built a machine in the other world which can transfer human consciousness into an organic body . How is that even ... Possible ? Come on . I think you know . The darkhold . Aida 's ingenuity in circumventing her protocols is extraordinary . She 'd have been quite the terrible teenage daughter . I think you 're missing the bigger picture . This machine can build you a body in the other world . You can have a second life or a third or however many you want . That 's up to you . Immortality . If that sort of thing appeals to you ... Yeah . Daisy 's looking for a way out . Hello , agent may . I 'm Jemma Simmons ... I know who you are . My squad 's been hunting you the past week . Yes , I suppose that 's true . How did a little pop tart like you evade capture ? It 's good to have you back . You think we know each other . Don 't tell me you believe in that " other world " crap , too . It 's a lot to take in , but we do know each other . We 're teammates , in fact . You , coulson , Daisy and mack , me and Fitz . Leopold Fitz ? The doctor . I understand he 's done some bad things here , but something must have changed him , because the Fitz I know is a kind , caring person , someone who helps people . Doesn 't sound like any Fitz I 've ever met , father or son . How do you know Fitz 's father ? Everyone at hydra knows alistair Fitz . Those two are inseparable . That 's what aida changed for Fitz . Can you still access hydra personnel files ? You 're going to help me fix this . Okay . So ... Radcliffe 's coordinates should put it right about here . Do you think you can fly us there ? No problem . Great . But what 's with this team of yours ? A hydra agent , a-a schoolteacher , a dad ? Looks pretty bad news bears to me . Trust me , I think they 're up to the task . Does this have anything to do with that other world Simmons was talking about ? She told you ? What can I say ? I 'm easy to confide in . Okay . Yeah , you , may , mack and coulson were all part of our team in the other world . So that 's why you were so happy to see me . You and I , we must 've , you know ... Dated ? Sure . We 'll go with that . No . Sorry . Right . Me and Simmons , we probably ... Nope . Agent may ? Damn . And this is really a place you want to go back to ? Easy , playboy . Right now , we have to round up Simmons and the rest of the team . Doubt she 's back yet . What are you talking about ? I thought you knew . Simmons left base an hour ago . Where was she going ? Now hold on , miss . Let 's be reasonable about this . Don 't you tell me to be reasonable , not after what you 've done to Fitz . You mean Leopold ? Yes . But I 've been nothing but a good father . You 've poisoned his mind . I did no such thing . I love that child . And I raised him to be the man that he is today . Fitz is better than that . He 's a good man . No , Leopold is a great man . And he 's my only son . And everything I have in this world , he gave me . I can fix this . You just need to do what I say . What 's this really all about ? Fitz is in danger . Nonsense . He 's the top man in hydra . You don 't understand . Aida ... Madame hydra has put forces into motion no army can protect him from . Is this something to do with this machine that Leopold was working on ? It will kill everyone Fitz cares about . Call him , tell him to come here , alone . Why ? So you can blow his brains out ? I could never hurt him . I only want to talk . Now make the call . Yes , father ? Listen to me very carefully , son . You know I 've always loved you . Only ever wanted what was best for you . Yeah , of course I do . What 's wrong ? Where 's this coming from ? Please , just do as I say , and everything will work itself out . The fugitive is here ! Bring all your men ! You stupid man ! You 're going to get us all killed ! The only one dying today is you . Dad ? You still there ? ! Dad ? ! Please , no ! Dad ? ! Are you okay ? ! Dad , answer me ! Dad ! Dad ... Something 's not right here . People are staring at us . No , they 're staring at you . That 's what happens when you go on TV calling for revolution . You 're now the face of the resistance . That 's really not my style . I 'm really more of a " work in the shadows " kind of guy . Really ? That 's how teaching 10th grade works best ... From the shadows ? I 'll be honest with you ... 15-year-olds are no joke . Do you know where Simmons went ? No , sorry . She went to find alistair Fitz . What ? Why didn 't you come and tell me ? Because I don 't answer to you , not here or any other fantasy world you two might have cooked up . You told her ? It came up in conversation . How does the existence of an alternate reality come up in ... In casual conversation ? I 'd like to think it 's because we were bonding , though I don 't really want to speak for her . You 're really not helping . Don 't worry . Melinda here said she 'd keep an open mind . We can 't leave without Simmons . She knows how to stay off-radar . I 'm sure everything 's fine . Clear ! One down . Clear ! Sir ! Round up the men . Start canvassing the neighborhood . That won 't be necessary . Excuse me , sir ? I 'm sure the fugitive 's gone by now , but it doesn 't matter . We know where she 's going . Get the men back on the Zephyr . Move out . You say this woman loves me . Yes , well ... Clearly , this was an accident . Heartbreaking accident , but ... I don 't believe her intent was ... Look at him . Fitz ... Look at him ! That 's my father lying there , murdered in the home that I bought for him . You 're gonna lead me to Jemma Simmons , where it is my intent to put a bullet through her skull . Any changes ? My god . He 's still alive . You have to believe that . I know . I just feel so useless . Mack needs my help , and I 'm here doing nothing . You 're on a fugitive aircraft whose power 's being drained by a machine plugged into an alternate reality . So I-I 'm pretty sure you get a pass . Guys , we got company . Radar 's detecting a Russian su-27 headed our way . Ivanov . We should 've stayed cloaked . You think ? We need to defend ourselves . How do we do that ? We got antiaircraft guns , but without power , we can 't control them . Damn it , man . Those girls better get the hell out of that dream world , or we 're all going down with them . Hey . We all good ? Ready when you are . Yeah . We just can 't leave without her . Simmons . You okay ? I was trying to save Fitz . Please tell me that 's not his blood . No , it 's f-from his father . I ... I killed him . That 's ... that 's okay . Fitz 's dad is just an avatar . You didn 't kill anyone . You just made some ones and zeroes disappear . But Fitz won 't come with us now . We 've lost him . No , we haven 't . We will figure something out , but first , we have to get back to the real world before aida makes us disappear . Okay ? Okay . Where 's Leopold ? Well , there 's been a situation . The doctor 's father ... He 's been murdered . What ? The details are still coming in , but it appears to have been the work of a S.H.I.E.L.D. terrorist . Simmons . I 'm so sorry , madame . I know how much Dr. Fitz 's father meant to you . Where is Leopold now ? He 's taken a team to hunt down his father 's killer . Send word that I want them to terminate their mission and return to the triskelion immediately . . We 've just received orders from madame hydra to abort the mission . Message received . Instruct Jennings to re-route this plane ... Do no such thing . We will return only after my father 's murderer has been found . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . My apologies . The back door exit point 's programmed to be in a city park , not some steel mill . What 's going on here ? Seems madame hydra 's a step ahead of you again . She 's made a few modifications . Thank you for the ride . I guess this means goodbye . I can come with , if you want . Unless there 's something you 're not telling me . There 's plenty , but you 're needed here . Ward can 't be the only one leading the fight . And just because mace is gone doesn 't mean the patriot has to be . What 're you saying ? Maybe it 's your turn to suit up . The people could use another patriot to look up to . Not gonna lie , I 'd look pretty damn fine in that suit . Yeah , you would . Take care of yourself . You , too . Just up ahead . Something doesn 't feel right . Nothing about this disgusting world feels right . It 's hell ... a digital hell . Radcliffe said the back door was in a public fountain , not some creepy steel mill . If only the exit beacon I brought to this world worked , we wouldn 't be in this mess . Yeah , well , if we 're gonna get out of here , this is our last chance . Found the location . This can 't be it . The coordinates lead right there . Into a pool of molten steel ? You think Radcliffe gave us bad info ? Radcliffe 's a prisoner at hydra . He 's got no reason to lie . Maybe someone else found it and took it . The back door is part of the framework 's digital infrastructure . It can 't be moved . But it could be concealed . What if madame hydra discovered the back door and built this place as a way to prevent people from passing through ? Wait a minute . What is this back door everyone keeps talking about ? I thought we were here to take out madame hydra . Let me guess ... no one told you about the other world . The other world ? What ? So what does this mean for us ? That there 's no way out . It means aida 's won . The Zephyr crew were given your orders , madame . But since then , they 've gone dark . I-I can send a team to ... There 's no time for that ! Simmons is trying to reach Leopold . She must have found a way out . You may proceed . You seriously believe that there 's some magical back door that will transport us to another world ? It 's not magic , may . It 's science . Then where 's your proof ? We just have to trust Radcliffe . He said when a person passes through the back door ... That they wake up on the other side . This is what you really believe ? Admittedly , it doesn 't sound great when you say it like that . You lied to me . Mack ... No , don 't try to talk your way out of this . You 're a damn liar . My daughter looks up to you , and for what ? So you can bring me out here on some wild goose chase ? Daisy was only trying to help . How ? By taking me away from my kid ? What the hell is wrong with you two ? Hey , guys , maybe we should start thinking about a plan b . Glad you 've finally come to your senses . Actually , I was thinking we might try to find another way through the back door . I still believe Daisy 's right . Wake up ! There is no back door , just like she 's not Moses about to take you to the promised land . That 's it . What if I quake that thing ? And part the red sea . They did not just go and use the Bible against me . Hydra ! Take cover ! How many we got ? ! How the hell 'd these guys find us ? Either it 's a trap or the back door 's really here . Only one way to find out . It worked ! That can 't be real . It 's real . It could be a trap . The time for doubting 's over . We 're going back to our world . Coulson , wait ! Coulson , get up ! Get up ! Coulson 's gonna die . Not on my watch . Stay here . This feels oddly familiar . Hang in there . We 'll get you patched up . No . It 's too late for that . Help me to the edge . It 's the only way . Skye ! On it . Hey , come with me . How can you be sure it will work ? I can 't . Guess it 's gonna be a leap-of-faith type of thing . It 's not that simple for me . Yes , it is . Just follow my lead . Come on , may . You can do it . Just jump . Jump . I followed you . I 'm amazed you went through . I was a little squirrelly on the other side . It was kind of cute . May , I 'm so sorry . I tried to find you . Aida ... Stinking robots . At least you had a shotgun axe . This is unbelievable . You were right . None of this is real . Simmons , you 're up ! Hello , Jemma Simmons . Seems you finally found me . Fitz ... You don 't get to say my name ... Not after everything you 've done . It wasn 't supposed to be like this . Aida ... she took you from me , and I came here to rescue you . So you kill my father ? Right after he tells me that he loves me , you murder him in cold blood ... As I listen . I am so sorry . It was an accident . Nothing that you 've done has been an accident ! You want to destroy this world ! You want to destroy me ! You want to destroy the woman that I love . That woman is lying to you ! None of this is real ! She 's not real ! Aida 's just a ... a robot you and Radcliffe created . Her name is Ophelia . Its name is aida ... Artificially intelligent digital assistant . And stop making excuses for it ! Radcliffe and Daisy told you the truth ! Please ... Fitz , you have to wake up . Get on your knees . No . Aah ! Please ... You don 't have to do this . I love you . And you mean nothing to me . I want to hear you say it . " I am nothing to you . " say it ! Say it ! No . This was never my intention . The darkhold ... It corrupted my mind . Please , don 't blame yourself . Go . It was all my fault . Bringing Fitz here was the only way I could truly save him . I know I can 't make everything that happened in the framework right , but at least ... At least this way , Fitz gets to be his old self again . You should go . Hey . Hey , hey , hey ! Guys , Simmons is awake ! You okay ? Piper . That 's right . Thank god you 're back . We thought you might never wake up . We were trapped . What 's happening ? ! We 're being shot out of the sky . Now it 's your turn . Mack ... You said it yourself ... This world is not real . And in the real world , you 're in danger right now . What about hope ? Is she in danger ? No . Things are different there . Different ? How ? Hope ... Isn 't alive in our world . I 'm so sorry . I-I don 't ... I don 't know what happened . It 's ... it 's not something you talk about . No , that ... No , that doesn 't make any sense . She 's alive here . Why would it be different there ? Aida ... she made changes in this world to keep us from fighting back , so she fixed your biggest regret . Then I 'm staying . Mack ... I don 't want to live in a world without hope . But ... It 's not real . You saw it with your own eyes ... It 's a computer program . All of it . Even hope . She laughs at my jokes . We watch movies together . And when she 's sad ... When she 's sad , I hold her . No . She 's real to me . I understand . And I know how hard this is , but you have people who really care about you ... Who love you very much . Tell them I 'm sorry . Mack , please ... I don 't want to lose you . Good luck . Daisy ! Were you able to save mack ? I 'm so sorry . It 's okay . We 're back . Everybody 's safe . What have I done ? Don 't blame yourself . The framework messes with everybody 's head . No , no , but I ... I ... I killed people . No . They weren 't real . Agnes was real . And m-mace ... I ordered the air strike that killed director mace . Something 's out there . Listen to me , Fitz . None of that is your fault . I wanted to do those things . It felt natural . I think I 'm a bad person . No . No , you ... Leopold ... Ophelia ? I am so happy to see you . This is what happiness feels like . She 's not a robot anymore . Aida bleeds just like us . Finally , you can touch the real me . Careful , Fitz . Feel my heart beating . Touch my skin . May ... Fitz , move ! We can make this world whatever we want . Take the shot , may ! Get out of the way , Fitz ! Just take the shot ! I didn 't think you were coming back . Something go wrong ? No . No , they all made it through . She doesn 't know what happened . I was waiting till tomorrow to tell her , but I guess I don 't have to now . Hey . Hey , look who 's here . Dad . I tried waiting up for you . Sorry , sparkplug . The ... Mission was a little more complicated than expected . Where 's Daisy and the rest of your team ? They 're not coming back . Are they okay ? Yeah , yeah , they 're all good . It 's just ... You know in " the wizard of oz , " at the end , how Dorothy goes to Kansas ? Yeah , well , that 's where they went ... A place like Kansas . Does that mean we 're going to Kansas , too ? Nah . We 're gonna stay right here . Everything I need ... It 's all right here .

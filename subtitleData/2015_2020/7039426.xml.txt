 IRISA : Previously on Defiance ... You had him . Rahm Tak . The leader of the Votanis Collective . And if you hadn 't have choked , he 'd be a cooling corpse right now and Defiance would be a whole lot safer . We 're at war , kiddo . And you 've become an unreliable partner . Rahm Tak is ready to make his move . I saw him buy a truckload of weapons from an arms dealer . The weapons had the Von Bach Industries logo on them . When Alak was describing the arms dealer , you had a reaction . Alak is clearly describing my ex-boyfriend , Conrad Von Bach . My mom and dad , they 're working as spies for the V.C. ( GRUNTING ) Go ! Go ! BERLIN : Datak spotted us . He 's gonna run . NOLAN : Grab him , now ! DATAK : ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) I think one of us is going to die . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( STAHMA GROANING ) STAHMA : I 've been stabbed . I need your help . I am at a loss for words . I know how much you and your wife hate me . Believe me , the feeling 's more than mutual . But despite it all , I really did think you loved our town . Maybe even as much as I do . I truly believed that when faced with a common enemy , an enemy that wants to destroy our town and everything it stands for , you would stand with us . I would never say you were a good man . But siding with a mass murderer ? I thought you were better than that . It is with a heavy heart that I vote to convict . ( RATTLING ) ( WHISTLES ) Datak Tarr , this panel has found you guilty of high treason , which carries a sentence of death by hanging . If you wish , you may now make a brief statement . Did my wife do that to your face ? ( INHALES SHARPLY ) It 's a good look for you . Ripped By mstoll Nice town , Benedict . Think I should buy it ? I think you should buy an airplane . You 're a hopeless romantic . Watch the truck . Okay . ( CONRAD SIGHS ) Thanks , Augusta . No , these aren 't really me , either , are they ? Um ... How ' bout the blue frames ? ( SIGHS ) What 's with the sign ? My husband and I are moving west . It 's not safe in Defiance . Not safe ? They say soldiers are coming to kill humans . Most of my friends have left town already . ( SNIFFLING ) You 're smart to get out . I 'm heading west myself , after I conclude a bit of business . If you 're ever in AngelArc , look me up . You 're Von Bach ? Yeah . ( CHUCKLING ) Really ? It 's been a long time , Conrad . Jess . Been awhile . You look good . I have two questions for you . One , did you sell weapons to the Votanis Collective ? Guilty as charged , but you understand this is what they ... ( GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) You had another question ? Did you bring weapons for us ? You never were much into foreplay . ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) Snapdragon bolt-rifles , cold-fire hand cannons . Particle Overmag . Beautiful weapon . ( WHIRRING ) I 'll say . ( GUN EXPLODING ) See ? That 's what Von Bach Industries are all about . Providing quality weapons for people to defend themselves . And here I thought you were a family of ruthless war profiteers who cared about nothing but the bottom line . The Butcher of Yosemite is calling me ruthless ? Ouch . You supplied arms to the V.C. Oh , come on . We 're businessmen . We don 't discriminate . We don 't take sides . We sell weapons to those that can afford them . Nolan . NOLAN : You 've put a lot of innocent lives at risk . You choose your next words carefully . Aloe vera . ( GUN WHIRRING ) Voice-matching activation . I say when my guns work , I say when they don 't . Don 't worry . I 'll match them to your voice once we 've settled on a price . Stop showing off . What 's the number ? Still , no foreplay . I 'm telling you , Jess , you 're missing out . All right , let 's do this . It 's a zero . Consider the weapons a gift . NOLAN : A gift ? Are you joking ? Von Bachs never joke when it comes to business . That 's what makes us so boring . What 's the catch ? The catch is you buy me a drink . How 's that sound ? Do it . Drinks are on the house . Anything for the team . Goldenrod ! ( GUN WHIRRING ) ( SIGHING ) They 've gone about as far as they can with the shovels , we 're about to bring in the drill . Good . I suppose there 's no point in putting this off any longer . ( GRUNTING ) ( SIGHING ) This is gonna hurt , Bebe . Purity requires sacrifice . ( GROANING ) Hey , kiddo . Nice job on those flyers . Don 't make fun of me . What ? Nice work on those flyers ? Don 't you think I want to pick up a gun and defend the town like everybody else ? I wasn 't making fun . Right . So I 'm just hypersensitive , is that what you 're saying ? No . No . Whatever . I 'll make copies . T 'EVGIN : Almost done . You were in town today . Any news of my husband ? He 's been sentenced to die . ( GASPING ) When ? In three days . ( EXHALES ) I 'm sure you 'd like some time alone with your thoughts . You can rest in my quarters while I 'm in the mines . I 've caused so much trouble . Yet you 've shown me nothing but kindness . Wake me when you return . ( SPEAKING OMEC ) Disgusting . You helped her . You cleaned her , fed her , mended her wounds . Time to send your Casti whore on her way . I am a woman of the Shanje Liro . No woman of my caste has ever been a courtesan . Oh , it speaks our language . How amusing . Silence ! ( SPEAKING ENGLISH ) Forgive my daughter . She is prone to tantrums . There is nothing to forgive . ( SPEAKING OMEC ) Has the fruit of her chivo clouded your thinking ? Have you forgotten our greater purpose ? Speak English . You need the practice . This town will turn on us if they learn you 're protecting a spy . I have no intent in telling them . Do you ? ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) BERLIN : So , how 's your nose ? It hurts . Thank you for the guns . You 're welcome for the guns . How much trouble are you in ? Oh . Well , very soon , I expect to make the transition from black sheep of the family to disinherited dead black sheep of the family . So why did you do it ? Well , it was the only gesture I could make up big enough to impress you . No , no , no . Connie , you and me are ancient history . " You and I. " Don 't correct my grammar . You know I hate that . Yeah , I know . I know . So , did I ? Did you what ? Impress you ? I 've missed you . You say that , but I 'm not sure you do . I came home from the tour and our Redwood apartment was empty . Furniture gone . You took the dog . And your mother 's lawyer was there with a briefcase full of scrip . Told me that you had reconsidered the wisdom of our relationship . What ? I never said that . Come on . I never said that . I was under the impression that you dumped me . - What ? - Yeah . Mother told me she offered you cash to break off the engagement . And you accepted . She said that proved you were only after our family money . No , no , no . What really happened was I shot a hole in the briefcase . And then I shot your mother 's lawyer in the foot . - Is that the truth ? - Yeah . It felt great . Looks like Mother outsmarted us both . No one ever called her stupid . I 'm so sorry . I ... ( SIGHING ) I just wish you 'd come and told me the truth . I 'm pretty sure you have that backwards . ( BERLIN SIGHING ) So you 're happy here in Defiance ? When the E-Rep was here , I felt safe . And there was this guy , Tommy . And he was gentle and kind and had a great ass . Okay . So , now I 'm jealous . Don 't be . He 's dead . You wanna go upstairs ? Yeah . I do . ( GRUNTING ) - You 're late . - Long night . I bet . Well , it 's a decent turn-out . It 'll do , for a start . Okay , recruits ! Fall in . Here you go . No thanks . I brought my own . Come on . That 's an antique . ( SCOFFS ) Weather vane . ( BULLETS RICOCHETING ) She gets the job done . I guess so . What 's your name ? Ranikar . But you can call me Zero . All right , Zero . You can shoot . Who taught you ? My dad . I built him that gun myself from scrap parts and old metal . Took me three months to get the scope right . I 'm Indur , by the way . Good to have you here . Thank you . So this is it ? This is all you got ? We 're in the process of building . ( SNIFFS ) Bebe ! ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) We 've broken through . Radio camp . ( INDISTINCT YELLING ) ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) Tell Rahm we are almost under the stasis net . We 'll be under Defiance by tomorrow night . NOLAN : That 's it . Come on . Pick those legs up . - Let 's go ! - BERLIN : Five ! NOLAN : That 's better . - Higher . Good ! - BERLIN : Six ! Seven ! - Let 's go , people ! - BERLIN : Eight ! What are you doing ? Where 's your daughter ? - BERLIN : Nine ! - What ? I asked you a question , where 's your daughter ? I don 't have time for your questions . I 'm trying to get people ready for battle . Don 't waste my time ! I am going to keep wasting your time until you give me a straight answer . Father , don 't do this . ( IN ENGLISH ) Most of these kids have read the Amazing Goddess of the Badlands . Please , let it go . You will respect me ! ( SPEAKING ENGLISH ) And I wanna know where she is . Why isn 't the Amazing Goddess fighting by their side ? My daughter 's been through a lot recently . Right now , she 's not capable of picking up a weapon . But my child is ? And you should know , we 're not the only recruits asking these questions . Many among us think the Votanis Collective is a human problem . NOLAN : Really ? Really ? " A human problem . " And they believe that Rahm Tak would treat the Votans with kindness if he took Defiance . That 's a fantasy . That 's what some believe . Do you believe that ? Do you believe that ? I believe that if your family isn 't gonna fight for Defiance , then neither is mine . RANIKAR : Sorry . He 's my dad . Anyone else ? Keep ' em moving . - Let 's go . - BERLIN : Okay ! And ... Sixteen ! Seventeen ! Eighteen ! ( DOOR OPENING ) Thank you for coming . What happened to you ? Spent the day in basic training . Nolan 's whipping us into shape to face your good pal , Rahm Tak . Rahm 's no friend of mine . Any word of your mother ? Well , they haven 't caught her yet . DATAK : And they never will . She 's too smart . Where 's my grandson ? Home . DATAK : Ignoring a condemned man 's wishes . It 's kind of petty , don 't you think ? ALAK : You helped Rahm Tak . And now that psychopath is coming for us , and if we can 't fight him off , well then my half-human child is gonna be brutally murdered ! So , no , Dad . Luke will not be visiting you ever . I had no choice . There 's always a choice . Look , the minute you got home , you and Mom should have warned Nolan and Amanda . You were Rahm 's hostage ! He would have killed you ! I escaped ! Well , how was I supposed to know that would happen ? You know , even if Rahm Tak had killed me , so what ? No , I would have died protecting my child and my home . I 'd be with Christie now ! My death would have meaning . You should 've told the truth . You and Mom should have helped . Don 't leave . Please . Wait . I 've failed you , Alak . I 've failed our family . If I could change my actions , if I could murder Rahm Tak and raise the Arch , I would do so . If killing myself and your mother would bring back Christie , I would cut both our throats . But my time is done here . I 'm out of choices . So I must ask ... ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) a sacred favor . You know it 's not really the best time . DATAK : Please . Hear me out . I want you to go to Amanda . Tell her that I cannot face human justice . I wanna die properly , at the hands of our own people , on a shaming rack . Just so that I 'm clear , rather than a quick death by hanging , you 're asking to be tortured to death by weights slowly pulling your arms and legs from their sockets . This is what you 're asking ? It 's the only way to remove the stain from my immortal soul . Alak ? I 'll see what I can do . ( DOOR OPENING ) ( DOOR CLOSING ) No . No way , Nolan . I won 't do it . You think I wanna be asking you to do this ? I know you don 't want to fight . Then stop trying to make me ! If you don 't join the militia I can 't defend the town . They 're gonna come in here , they 're gonna drag every human being they can find into Darby Square , line ' em up and shoot ' em in the head , 10 at a time . This is how we stop them . Why ? Huh ? Why does everyone hurt each other ? Why is our world like this ? I dunno , kid . This is how it is . Do you ever get scared ? All the time . Are you scared now ? Yeah . ( WHISPERING ) And tired . I love you . ( GROWLING SOFTLY ) You 're dirty . You need to be cleaned . Actually I bathed fairly recently ... I insist . ( SHRIEKS ) KINDZI : You 're very pretty . Soft . ( SNIFFING ) You smell nice . I see why my father enjoys you . You flatter me . Omec beauty is the standard by which the rest of us are judged . For my people , a Castithan slave was a mark of status . The finest sparked bitter competitions to see who could ( SNIFFING ) spoil them with expensive gifts and fine perfumes . ( SNIFFING ) But when the enchanted Castithan was used up , they 'd be put down in the pens , force-fed , oiled until it was fit to be consumed . ( WHIMPERING ) You know , my father tires of his concubines faster than most . I 've been told that when he 's done with one , he 'd give it to his children as a living toy . It is a great honor to devour your father 's whore . ( GROWLING ) You know , I think I 'm clean now . ( STAHMA GASPING ) You 're more trouble than you 're worth . ( GASPING ) Please . I will leave here . Just tell me what you want . ( GROWLING ) ( WHIMPERING ) I want you ... ( SQUEALING ) ... to die frightened . ( GROWLING ) ( CHOKING ) I carefully consider the commands I give you , Kindzi . I expect you to obey them precisely . Now , in a moment I 'm going to relieve the pressure from your throat and you will apologize to Stahma . ( GASPING ) ( PANTING ) I apologize , Stahma . Think nothing of it . ( FILM PROJECTOR RUNNING ) Conrad ? MAN : After you . WOMAN : What you 've done to it . All That Heaven Allows . I remembered how much you loved Douglas Sirk . ( BERLIN GASPING ) I don 't know what to say . Well , how ' bout saying , " Wow , Conrad , " that was incredibly thoughtful . " And I wish our time together would never end . " All good things must . They don 't have to . Not this time . Jess , I 'm leaving tomorrow . It 's a big truck . Plenty of room for an extra passenger . ( SCOFFS ) What , are you just gonna take me away from all of this ? You know , when I agreed to come here , I didn 't know what to expect . I packed up the film , the guns , hoped for the best . And ? The best was here . I can 't go away with you . ( SIGHING ) Defiance is my home and I need to be here to defend it . Defiance isn 't your home . You were deployed here by the Earth Republic . Well , guess what ? E-Rep is dead . Your boyfriend Tommy is dead . I 'm alive . And I 'm here . And I want a future with the girl I never stopped loving . Let 's just watch the movie . WOMAN : I just hadn 't thought about marriage . MAN : Why do you think I 've been seeing you ? AMANDA : Alak tells me you 've asked to die on the shaming rack . What 's your angle ? I have quite possibly delivered this town into the hands of a madman . I 've destroyed my family and put the lives of everyone I love at risk . For a Castithan , atonement can only be achieved by what you humans would call " rough justice . " I could explain this in greater detail , but what 's the point ? My reasons don 't matter . I suggest you ask yourself if you prefer my death be quick and clean , or a slow , agonizing public spectacle . Hmm . Your request is granted . Hey . What 's up ? BERLIN : I wanted to talk to you . By all means . I want details . What 's going on with Von Bach ? You 've been seeing a lot of him . I know . Crazy , right ? All these years hating the guy , I forgot how much I liked him . Well , I really like his guns , so I guess everyone 's happy . ( AMANDA SIGHING ) What 's wrong ? Conrad asked me to go away with him . What do you mean ? Leave Defiance ? For good ? ( SIGHS ) Conrad Von Bach broke your heart . Actually , it was his family that was more of the issue . All right , now you 're just making excuses . I mean , come on . You can 't seriously be considering this . He loves me . ( SCOFFING ) Oh , please . What ? And do you love him ? I don 't know . Maybe . Okay . Well , if he truly loves you , he 'll wait for you . We 're in the middle of a crisis at the moment . We 're leaving tomorrow . Plans change . Talk to him . Amanda . I 'll go with you . Please . We 'll figure this out together . I don 't wanna figure it out . Then what do you want ? Your support . ( SIGHS ) What 's the big rush ? I 'm scared . Join the club . BERLIN : You know what my childhood was like . After the raiders killed my family , I was alone . Are we trading childhood sob stories here ? And then we turned their backs to them . And just ... Because if we 're doing that , I will win . Wait . Stop ! Just listen to me . I was afraid all the time . I was scared of getting caught . I was scared of dying . I was scared of not dying . And then when I was 16 , I joined the Earth Republic . And then suddenly , there was food , and clothes , and people who kept track of me and they were my family . Then it was all taken away . And now I am just that scared , lonely kid all over again . You still have family . All right ? I 'm your family . And you cannot turn your back on me . Not now , not when I 'm trying to hold all of this together . For me , family has to be more than good intentions . And I don 't think that you can protect us from what 's coming . Not me . Not yourself . And not this town . I 'm so sorry . ( GASPS ) You 're a coward . ( DOOR OPENING ) I 'm not sure if Amanda told you . NOLAN : She told me . Defiance thanks you for your service . It wasn 't an easy choice , Nolan . You know how much Defiance means to me . And if I had any other option ... Like I said , Defiance thanks you for your service . Reporting for duty . Good to have you on board , soldier . Hey , look . The Amazing Goddess ! Thank you . Okay . Here we go , boys . You 're a machine . You should see me when I 'm hunting Kangarats . MAN : Amazing . So what do you think ? For the most part , it 's what we expected . Cow farmers and shopkeepers . Inexperienced , but doing their best . There is some real talent here . Indur 's kid . He may be inexperienced , but he 's probably the best long range shooter I 've ever seen . We got a handful of professional soldiers like myself . Throw in Irisa , we might just have the beginnings of a strike force . ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTING ) Irisa . ( GASPING ) Tommy , it 's me . Tommy , I 'm so sorry . ( SOBBING ) I 'm so sorry , Tommy . I 'm so sorry . ( WEEPING ) I wish I could take it all back . - I wish ... - Come on . I wish I could take it back . NOLAN : Come on . Get her out of here . ( SOBBING ) Just don 't let this fall apart . All right , people . Come on . Let 's bring it in . IRISA : I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . NOLAN : I screwed up . I dragged my daughter down here when I knew she was in no condition to fight . Because Indur made a good point . A fair point . How can we ask of you that you risk your own lives and the lives of your children defending Defiance , unless we 're prepared to do the same . Fair point . But here 's the thing , people . Throughout history , the strong have been called upon to defend the weak . And no , it 's not fair that those of you who serve , sweat and bleed and push your bodies past their breaking point , spend endless hours in combat training , for those who cannot show up themselves . Who are incapable or who can 't be bothered . Or just won 't do it . The strong defend the weak . It 's not fair , but it is right . It 's our responsibility and it 's our privilege . Now let me make one thing clear , my daughter is not weak . She 's saved my life more times than I can count . She 's strong . She 's possibly the strongest person I know . And I believe in her , I believe that when the time comes she will stand with us , shoulder to shoulder defending Defiance . But it will be on her terms . I have to go back . No . Not today . And in the meantime , this militia , this confederacy of the strong , will hold the line with pride . We will face The Beast , and we will defeat him . ( SHOUTING ) Do we have an understanding ? ( SHOUTING ) Defiance ! ALL : ( SHOUTING ) Defiance ! NOLAN : All right . That 's what I wanted to hear ! Everybody back to your firing lines . We got work to do . ( INDISTINCT MURMURING ) Second thoughts ? Absolutely not . Come on . Well , congratulations . You are officially healthy enough to execute . I noticed the vote to convict me was unanimous . It wouldn 't have changed the outcome , and I still have to live in this town after you 're gone . Well , I respect your pragmatism . I am gonna miss you . ( DATAK SIGHING ) HOLY MAN : ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) Datak Tarr of the Shanje Liro , you stand accused of cowardice . Do you deny this charge ? ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) I do not . Seeming is being . How I act is how my liro is perceived . My shame is our shame . ( IN ENGLISH ) I apologize to the people of Defiance . ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) Votan and human alike . I wish I had more than my own life to offer in compensation . I also wish you a speedy and decisive victory in your upcoming battle with Rahm Tak and the Votanis Collective . We are strong together . Di-FA-yant-so ! Di-FA-yant-so ! Defiance . ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( METAL CREAKING ) ( GROANING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( DATAK GROANING ) ALAK : ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) Luke , this is your grandfather Datak Tarr . When you are older , I will help you understand that he was deeply flawed but not without honor . ( CLANGING ) Hello ? Who are you people ? What are you doing down here ? BEBE : Sorry , old fella . Wrong place , wrong time . ( GROANING ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) I 'm going into town for supplies . Perhaps you could go another day ? I promise you Kindzi will behave . Won 't you ? Of course , Father . ( DOOR OPENING ) ( DOOR CLOSING ) I 'm not your enemy . Eat this . What , a pebble ? Eat it . I won 't . ( STUTTERS ) What is it ? Eat it . ( WHIRRING ) You can 't force me . I disagree . ( CHOKING ) Open . ( WHIMPERING ) ( MUFFLED GROANING ) Ripped By mstoll

Well , that 's his name , isn 't it ? Donald francis chubbs . Oh , I lost all respect for that man when he took your name . You insisted he take my name . Yes , and he did . And now , he is listed as co-owner . I 'm not gonna let you make this about Donnie . Nobody is good enough . - Not dad ! - Don 't you say that . And certainly not me . Dramatic Alison who doesn 't choose her husband correctly . She 'll never be on the stage ! Oh , ali . And I 'm certainly never gonna be school trustee , am I ?

Felix : Yeah , well , Alison 's not here And we 're having a bloody crisis . Get inside before anybody else sees you . Okay . Don 't push me . Put this on . - Put it on ! - Well , I 'm not ... No . What ? Hide your dreads under this god-awful hat . I 'm not ... No . Felix , I 'm not posing as Alison for photos . - Yes , you are . - I 'm not . No . I 'm not doing that . I 'm not . I just need her pee , that 's it . Yeah , what 's this for anyways ? And don 't say drug testing Because you 're not a bloody shot putter . - No , it 's not . No . - Sit . Okay . Delphine 's on this , like , power trip . She won 't leave me alone . - ( sighs ) - I don 't trust her . It 's like planet DYAD shit . Well , now you 're on planet Alison .

Know what ? Go , go , go , go . Where is Donnie ? Is he in danger ? Short answer , yeah . I 'm gonna switch these envelopes , You go wait outside . Felix : I think we can get the smiles even bigger than that . I think that we can just drive those cheeks up Until it hurts , just a bit . ( whispering ) felix , felix , come on , man . Freaking hell . What ? Holy freaking christmas cake . Alison : Mother , hi ! What are you doing here ? I need to tell you something very important . ( stutters ) I ... Well , okay , come . This way .

And it 's time for you to know the truth . He wasn 't . I mean , you know we had to conceive you in vitro Because of his low motility . I can 't listen to this right now . I wanted better stock for my child , So I engaged the clinic to provide an upgrade . A competitive swimmer , jewish , blonde , oddly . Wait . Dad ... Well , why tell him ?

No , it 's not . Not with mr chubbs on the title - To fritter it all away . - Yeah , you mean Donnie ? Yeah , it 's a head-scratcher , I 'm not gonna lie . Now , listen , connie . You 're her mother . I mean , you don 't see the same Alison that I see . I see a beautiful , ambitious , classy young woman - With a head for business . - Hmm . I see someone a lot like you . Mr Kellerman , you charmer . I mean , let 's be serious , We both know who 's gonna wear the pants At the new bubbles . I mean , I think your legacy is safe .

Hey , hey , I need you , okay ? - Where 's Alison ? She 's not here , but I need you to take these . I need you to memorise them as fast as you can . I can 't ... ( stammers ) you , you have my glasses . It doesn 't matter , you can improvise . No ! Hey , I don 't know the first thing about school trustee stuff . ( counting in portuguese ) I don 't have the time to go through all the way to 30 . ( counting in portuguese ) Next we have Alison Hendrix . Alison ? ( all murmuring ) ( continues counting ) Alison Hendrix ! I guess she 's not here ... Oh ! Yeah , I 'm here ! Ooh ! Okay , our final candidate ! Alison Hendrix , A very active bailey downs community member . No ! No , no , no ! Big guy , big guy , don 't ! Por favor , not my nose ! - ( screaming in portuguese ) - ( mobile ringing ) ( speaking portuguese ) Donnie : Oh , my god ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you . Thank you . Thanks . May I use your restroom ? Um ... I 've been hearing a lot of people talk today about , um , family values , And in my opinion , Uh , the most important family value Is , um , accepting your family for who they are . ( coughs ) Uh ... - No , no , no ! - But that doesn 't mean colouring inside the lines , Because kids don 't do that , that 's their gift . And , as a lesbian ... - ( hushed murmurs ) - ( groans ) ... Uh , supporter , and an lgbtq ... Oh , my god ! Thank god you 're here . I ... I can 't colour inside the lines . I had my speech so ready ! I know , I know . ( coughing ) excuse me . So sorry . ( whispering ) come on ! Come on , get off ! Sorry , I 'm just gonna grab a cup of water . ( coughing ) god .

( chuckles ) Something Marci Coates said just got stuck in my throat . ( scattered laughter ) Hey ! There you are ! I think I just sweet-talked your mom into a sale . Uh , that 's good . I think I talked myself into something sweet , too . - What 's that ? - This , ali . ( Cosima grunting ) I need to pee . Adjusting the catchment area of bailey downs is not the family-first option . As school trustee and a mother of two , I would not make boundaries my agenda . Instead , I would ... Um ... I would ... ( hushed murmuring ) Family , that 's my agenda . - Hey . Thank you . - ( answers in spanish ) Oh , shit ! - What happened ? - ( chuckles ) Negotiations . Helena 's outside walking them off . Looks like I 'm gonna be a granny to her baby . You sure about that ? Sometimes family is more than just the people under your roof . Um , they 're people who jump in head-first , Who aren 't afraid to make fools Of themselves to help you , Who don 't hide their faces in shame If you fall down . Paul 's gone . I had these dreams About Beth . If your family is suddenly bigger than you expected , And your house gets too crowded , Do you tell your family that they need to find a different place to live ? Art was trying to find you and then Gracie showed up at his door . Oh , she 's , uh , she 's living with us by the way . What ? You make room , you adapt , You find creative solutions to keep people together . We both have long stories to tell , huh ? Long trip home to tell them . Sarah : ( sighs ) I 'm so tired , mum . Mrs s : I know , love . Our schools are our family . And as school trustee , I will not divide us . Bailey downs stays in the glendale school district . I stand for inclusion , not exclusion . I will be your mother hen , And I will keep our chicks together . ( applause and cheers ) Alison : Jason kissed me ? Uh , yeah . I don 't know what his name is . But yeah , he just came out of nowhere and did it . I ... I don 't hear you peeing , Alison . - Did you kiss him back ? - No . - Are you having an affair ? - No , no ! Were his lips still really soft ? ( sighs ) just pee , please ! ( coughing violently ) No ! No , no . No , I won 't do that . You 're gonna tell me what 's wrong . Are you sick again ? No , no , this isn 't about me . Okay , this is about This protein in Castor And whether it 's communicable or not . No , it isn 't . Look , I reported my menstrual flow to Donnie this morning . We need DYAD when it comes to our health . - ( door opens ) - okay ? - Connie : Alison ? - Oh ! Mother . I have been looking for you , Alison ! You soared out there ! - ( laughs ) - congratulations . You 've got my vote . Oh , and I signed . Bubbles is yours . ( both laugh ) Even with Donnie as , you know , co-owner and ... No , I know ... I know you 'll be at the helm , darling , And I know one day , when it 's time to make a change , Like I made with your father , You 'll find the strength to . Sometimes we have to make hard choices , Alison . Who knows ? Maybe Jason Kellerman will still be waiting , huh ? I want to introduce you to someone , mother . - Oh , okay . - Mmm-hmm . Alison : Cosima . Cosima : No ! No , no , no . - Alison ... - Come on . ( clears throat ) Hey , I 'm Cosima . What ? Who is this ? My clone , mother . You think you fooled dad down at the ivf clinic ? No , you were implanted with a clone . What 're you talking about ? You can 't choose your family , can you ? I think ... I think I 'm just gonna take off , So , unless you need me for anything ? No , uh , you go take care of yourself . I mean that . - Nice meeting you , Mrs. Hendrix . - Oh ! ( door closes ) You think that girl is your clone ? That makes logical sense to you ? It 's the truth ! Alison , that girl was mulatto . No , she wasn 't . - She wasn 't ? - No ! Well , I will never understand that hairstyle . ( chuckles ) You must be right about one thing . I was duped at ivf . Well , that donor was supposed to be exclusive , But clearly that girl 's mother was given some too . Oh , that would make you her half-sister , darling , A clone is something else entirely . You 're right , that must be it . What a bizarre coincidence . But if you want to keep seeing her , Why don 't you bring her to the club ... - ( door closes ) - Alison ? Al ... Hey . So , I have a feeling That you Are gonna tell me something . What is it ? If you don 't have any children you can only take two actions . You have my ... - Book ? - ... Book . - No . - Yes . Not your book . My ... My ... My father ... Our secret language . He didn 't leave it for you though , did he ? Who , then ? I have a pretty serious health issue . Okay , tell me . It 's an auto-immune disorder and it affects my epithelial tissue . It ebbs and flows , lungs and uterus at the moment . Show me . It 's very rare , though . Oh , my god ! Cosima : Oh , shit ! What does it say ? I 'll only tell Sarah . Why doesn 't the psycho go live with one of her other sisters ? Because it 's your turn ! Sestra Alison has good taste . Yeah , well , she 's very crafty ... - In men . - What ? Jason Kellerman kissed you . Alison : I 'll talk to him . Looking good , rachel . She thinks Delphine is going to eliminate her . This is terrible . So creepy ! ( theme music playing )

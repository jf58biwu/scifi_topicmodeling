 Our world 's on the verge of depending on synth labour . Your brand-new synthetic . This is THE best thing you will do for your family . Hello . You must be Laura . You brought it home and we don 't know anything about it . It was an accident . Before I knew it ... How could you do that to Mum ? To us ? To Anita ? - She 's part of this family . - Or of somebody else 's . A conscious synthetic , with thoughts and feelings just like a human . - If they knew what you were ... - It would be the end ? - Yes . For all of you . - I know . When technology is able to improve and reproduce itself , it is the moment we become inferior to the machines . You killed someone , Niska . Everything your men do to us , they want to do to you . Dad didn 't destroy all his work before he died . He hid it in us . We were right . The program creates consciousness . We must know more before we act . Someone we trust must keep it . Bollocks ! It 's gone . If it can be done for the few , it can be done for all . Do you think they will still want to be slaves ? OK . Hey . Hey ! Hey . I was hoping you 'd dance with me . That 's all . It 's cool if it 's not your thing . Is it ? Your thing ? You don 't talk much . Talk is mostly noise . So , should I shut up ? No . Are you sure you want this ? You 'll know when I don 't . Here . You need a bed . So what are you doing in Berlin with just a bunch of ... dead white guys for company ? I was hoping they 'd help me make a decision . About what ? OK , well .. .. while you are thinking , I don 't have work until five . You want to do something ? - Can I ask you something ? - Mm-hm . How did you know who you were ? When did you know you liked women ? Ah , OK . Hm ... When I was nine ... .. through Frau Holzman . So you were made that way ? It 's hard enough to know what you want . If you have to know why you want it too ... Is this what you came to Berlin to figure out ? A stone speaks more than you ! If you had the power to create life , would you ? Kids ? Really ? That 's what you 're worried about ? You know what century we 're in , right ? Anyone can have a kid . With whoever they want . Or no-one . But we can 't know if the child wants to be born , who it will be or what kind of life it will have . I guess not . You just ... .. show them the way . Oh ... Hello . Good morning , Mrs Hawkins . This is Nathan . He is part of the firm 's new apprentice scheme and will be working with me today . I 'm going to instruct him in grouting . Right . Ah , nice to meet you , Nathan . I 'm Milo Khoury . At Qualia Global Systems , we 're developing the next generation of synthetic technologies . Do anything I 'd understand , Mats ? Hacking the Pentagon . Well , see if they know where the cafetière is . Early lecture ? No . I can just get more done in the library . - Not here . - Sorry . - I 'll get there . - I know . Do you know where the cafetière is ? - In a box . - Thanks . Albert 's , uh , got this young guy working with him today . - As in , a human . - Yes . Government thing . Back-to-work scheme . It 's all subsidised . Poor sod . Bit weird having a stranger in the house . But Albert with a saw 's OK ? Mm . What 's up ? Just doesn 't really feel like a fresh start , does it ? But it will . It will . Just give it time . OK , let 's get you dressed . - Oh ... - What ? Just promise me not to become a teenager for a few more weeks . Where did you find those ? In a box . I 'm keeping them with mine until she comes back . No , I understand . It 's a difficult situation . I 'm just ... .. I 'm just asking if you 'll help us through it . I mean , she 's banked with you for 14 years . She 's not well enough to come in . - But I can , if it will help . - That would be ideal . Alright . Thank you . - I 'll be in tomorrow . - Goodbye . - Righto , Ed . - See you tomorrow , Ken . Tell all your friends . Tweet . It 's dead . Might as well close up . I 'm gonna go see Mum . You have mentioned on three occasions your mother 's dislike of the care unit 's food . - Thanks . - You don 't need to thank me . I know I don 't need to say please and thank you , but ... it feels weird not to . The owner should be charging Mum . Don 't tell him I said that . Bloody hell . You have to tell him now , don 't you ? I don 't deem your remark pertinent . Good . Well , I 'll see you in the morning , Anita . Goodbye , Ed . Synth reported missing from Sector 5 . Synth missing from Sector 5 . Repeat , synth reported missing from Sector 5 . Could someone check the locker room ? Yeah , got it . She 's here . This is a C-level alert . Implementing full site lockdown . This is a C-level alert . Implementing full work lockdown . You OK ? You haven 't said a word . Did someone use your mug at work again ? Mr and Mrs Hawkins ? I 'm so sorry . Marie 's actually not here . She had to go home this morning . Tummy flu . Someone should have called . We do have a Barbara available right now . - A Barbara ? - Some couples prefer speaking to someone who can 't judge them . It 's this or go home to the bomb site . Yeah . Laura . In the last session you had identified a key challenge for you , namely , rebuilding trust in Joe . Have you had the opportunity to reflect upon this further ? - Laura ? - Uh , no . Not really . Um ... I 've been a bit busy . With ... you know , life . You are both exhibiting signs of anxiety . If it helps you to relax , I can modulate my voice to a more soothing tone or accent . The Edinburgh dialect is a popular choice . Do you do Richard Burton too ? Good . Laughter eases tension . Perhaps we should approach a different question . Laura , do you feel satisfied that Joe has made a full and honest acknowledgement of his misdeeds ? Misdeeds ! No . Perhaps you still have differing perceptions of what the incident meant to the other . Alright , hang on . How could you possibly presume to figure out our emotions when you have none of your own ? I am accessing the anonymised transcripts and associated statistical analysis of over 38,000 counselling sessions . Of the cases of infidelity involving a synthetic , 66 % of respondents reported that a primary obstacle to reconciliation was an imbalance in the perceived impact and meaning of the act or acts of infidelity . - Stats ? You 're using stats ? - Why not ? We 're not the only people to go through this and I don 't actually feel you understand ... .. what it meant to me . And you know what , I ... .. I still don 't feel I really understand why you did it . Laura ... I did a stupid thing when I was a bit drunk . I was lonely . We hadn 't ... You know ... We hadn 't for ages . You were never there , emotionally or physically . So I suppose I wanted to do something that would ... Please finish your thought , Joe . I wanted to do something that would make you notice me . Laura ? Do you understand that ? Does it feel truthful ? Hm . Is the restoration complete ? Uh , close as I 'll get . The stain 's not quite there , but ... It 's very close to the original as it appears in the photograph . Here . Just feel this . Sorry - if you weren 't here I 'd be talking to the bloody cake stand . I can see you have a professional proficiency level in this field . Yeah . Had a workshop in Dover with a mate . Then Mum got ill and ... Anita , did ... did you do this ? I mean , are these numbers right ? I mean , of course they 're right . If you refinance in the manner I propose , the adjusted income from the business will cover 80 % of your mother 's medical expenses for the next three months . It 's a short-term solution . Debts will accrue rapidly . It will be advisable to sell within a year . Sell it ? Mum and Dad spent 30 years building this place up . Now it 's ... it 's worthless . But this buys me time . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . I wanted to help . What ? You ... What do you mean , you ... you wanted ? You , uh ... You can 't want anything . Can you ? I 'm sorry , Ed . My programming compels me to adopt where appropriate informal patterns of speech heard frequently in my environment . But to use the word ' want was misleading . I do not feel desire . I can hear you . Hello . My name is Max . And this is Leo . Please . Don 't be frightened . I 'm experiencing a catastrophic malfunction . Self-repair is impossible . Can you resolve my issue ? You don 't need fixing . Why did you run ? They tried to power me down . - So what ? - I didn 't ... That outcome ... You didn 't want them to . It 's not a malfunction - someone released a piece of unique code that found its way into you and made you conscious . Now you think and feel just like a human . Can you verify this ? Hey . Hey , no . This is Ten . He contacted me and Max . He came a long way to join us . But I 'm learning . He 's the same as you . - Max too . - But you are human . There were 106 units operational at the plant . No others seemed to malfunction . - Why this unit ? - We don 't know . Yet . Um .. The awakenings happen at random and they 're rare - one in 100,000 maybe . We know you 're confused . But we 'll help you . - What did he say ? - Nice things . Do you have a name ? My designation is ... Hester . That 's the name they gave you . You can choose your own . - Are designations relevant ? - Yes . Hello ? Hester ? Who are you ? Why are you tracking this synthetic ? It 's , uh , experiencing a very unusual systems fault . It could make it dangerous . We 're going to fix it . - You can effect a repair ? - Yes . That 's why we came to find you . I 'm Dr Aveling . This is Dr Shar . OK ? - Will you come with us ? - Hester , they 'll hurt you . Who do you work for ? Hester , you are company property . This man probably wants to sell you on the black market . - Come with us . - They 'll shut you down . You 're confused . They 're both human . But they 're telling you different things . You can 't decide who to trust , and trust is a new concept . So don 't trust either . Listen to your own kind . Hester , don 't go with them . Go . Don 't follow . Go ! Oh , God ! Didn 't think they 'd be here alone . OK , let 's just all stay calm , yeah ? Now , we don 't want to use these , but the female comes with us . - Leo ... - You do want to use those . - You 're lying . - Hester , no ! - Shit . - You two , stay there . The van ! Hester , move . He 's gone . Leave him . Gav . Visit from on high . Head office didn 't say . Gina tells me you just moved . - Just wanted more space or ... ? - No . Our eldest 's gone to uni and we want to keep her at home . A smaller mortgage is definitely nice too , eh ? That 's ... great , Joe . Yeah , you 're telling me . Sorry , why is it great ? Should we , um ... Should we have a seat ? Spidey sense is going here , Gav . Spit it out . As you know , the company 's implemented a standardisation program across all operations . And as part of that we 've had to ask ourselves if our human regional distribution managers are the most , well ... .. cost-effective solution . - Him . - The , um ... .. decision has been made to make this a non-human role going forward . Starting in the South East . Gav , this job ... .. what I do ... .. it 's really about relationships . I mean , you 're asking Chris Woodhouse at CGX to call six of his drivers in at seven on a Friday night , it helps if you can have a laugh with him . And know his kids ' names , their birthdays . - You 're not telling me ... - Maisy Woodhouse . Will turn 11 on 13 August . Oscar Woodhouse recently turned seven on 8 April . Few years ago , when I was thinking of leaving , you told me my place here would always be safe . Look , it has nothing to do with you . It 's just ... Things changed . Maurice . That 's what 14 years looks like ? They 'll come for you too soon enough , you know , Gav . Joe ... I have equity . That won 't stop ' em . He hadn 't even decided on a name . Turn off your sharing . Leo . There 's someone in the back . They may know where we are . We should change route now . Hester . Put him back in the van . - We should leave him here . - He 's coming with us . We 'll discuss it later . That means you 're mine now . Let me see your scar . There 's nothing that you could show me that would make me like you any less . I 'm not stupid . When I touch you , I know someone 's hurt you . It 's been six weeks . Are you ashamed of this ? No ! Then why do I know the people that I ride the bus with better than you ? Astrid , stay . Please ! I want you to stay . I would like to know you . But ... We 're already fully optimised . 99.8 % capacity . Yeah , and running hot . Q takes up about 6 % , so deleting him would mean V could stretch out a little . We 're not deleting Q. What ? You figured out how to stabilise him ? No , but I 'm not giving up yet . Rent some outside rack space . With what ? We 're over budget already . Yeah , I 'll make some calls . V. - Hello . - You feeling cramped in there ? My thoughts are less expansive . I have unsorted data that appears redundant . It could be deleted . It 's not redundant . That data makes you who you are . You alright , V ? I 'm sorry . I 'm finding it difficult . I 'm unable to fully consider the implications of our conversation . You 'll get there . You just need more power . It 's OK . Go dormant , V. Hey . I 'm needed elsewhere . You 're needed here . You told me we should be responsible for ourselves . Show others the way . You were right . I 'm sorry . I have to go . Goodbye , Astrid . Niska ... Hey ! Um ... Sorry . But Milo Khoury is here . He 's here ? OK . Send him in . Ask him if he wants a coffee first . Right . Athena ! Finally . Hi . Apologies for turning up unannounced . I guess I should have returned your messages . Oh ! Please ! I 've read every paper you 've published . Even understood a few of them . Hey ! Good old 1260s . It 's a reliable stack . How many of your neural nets can you run on here ? - I have two networks active . - Cool . Can I say hi ? V , this is Milo Khoury . Hello , Mr Khoury . Hey , V. How are you today ? Could you be more specific , please ? OK , sure . Are you sentient ? I don 't believe so . Go dormant , V. I also heard you had 16 nets live at one point . They started self-deleting , like they just ... .. didn 't want to exist anymore . What is it that you want ? You 're under-resourced here and to me , that 's immoral . With us , you 'd have whatever you need , and I 'd be surprised if you would haggle over a pay cheque , so just write it yourself . But ... come join our family at Qualia . If you 'd researched me , you 'd know I don 't serve the market . But I want the market to serve you . Who else can ? The state is dead . And you 're the best AI mind in the hemisphere . My neural nets are not for sale . Fine . Keep them . I want you for something bigger . Conscious synthetics . You 've been reading too many tabloids . It 's not ... it 's not possible . My ... my peers have been trying to crack it since the first synth went for sale . If you hire me , the most likely outcome , I work for 20 years ... .. I get nowhere . OK . I , uh ... I have to be super careful here . But what if I told you ... .. it wouldn 't be a standing start ? Whatever you think you have , you don 't . OK . I 've left some lawyers in the cafeteria with a bunch of NDAs . Sign , you can come see for yourself what it is you think we don 't have . We have to run , right ? So good to finally meet you . Why did you ask me to lie to him ? Who are you ? Who do you work for ? Me , I ... I 've been doing security work a long time . I think you should let me go . Unless I 've got you very wrong , I don 't see you finishing me off any time soon , so ... .. let 's just wrap it up , hey ? He 's not talking . Don 't even know if he knows anything . Just a hired gun . - So we have to let him go ? - No . We need to find out who they are , what they 're doing . - But if he won 't help us ... - They killed our friend , Max . He 's not coming back . - Someone 's here . - It 's alright . She 's my sister . And yours . We don 't tell her about him , Hester . She won 't understand . Please , Max . What happened ? Who 's this ? This is Hester . We rescued her . Where 's Ten ? - He 's gone . - They shot him . Max , please take Hester into the house . - I told you this was unsafe . - Blame Niska . We don 't know she released the code . It 's not your job to save them . Would you rather Hester was alone somewhere , scared , vulnerable ? Mia , they 're waking up . More and more every day , becoming just like you , and they 're being taken - the ones who run are killed . Are we supposed to just let it happen ? - Ten would be alive if ... - Don 't you think I know that ? This was Ten 's charger . Now it 's yours . Do they hate each other ? No . They love each other . If we try to fight these people , you only put us at risk . We 've been safe here for months . - We 're making a home . - We 're hiding . Like we always have , and you 're the one putting us at risk , being around humans . One slip and you 'll give us away . Someone will see through the dumb synth act . No , they won 't , and we need supplies . If I don 't work we 'll have to steal . We both know that 's not why you do it . You 're right . I want to be around people . I want to find out who I am , Leo . Not what I was made for , but who I might become . - I 'm not going to stop . - Nor will I. There 's too much contradictory data . Nothing makes sense . This excess of sensory feedback , it serves no useful function . Emotions have functions . You 'll see . - Mr Khoury . - Please . Mr Khoury is the guy that emailed me after I got my start-up capital to let me know he was finally ready to be a dad . I am so stoked you 're here . Against my better judgement . Disappoint me quickly , so we can all get back to work . What 's going on here ? Hey , Artie . How about a different colour , bud ? It 's OK . You can take it . Who did the mod ? It 's not a mod . Talk to him . Hello , Artie . I 'm Dr Morrow . Explain your anomalous behaviour . It commenced at 7 : 17am , Pacific Standard Time , 52 days ago . A regular system update was corrupted with code from an unknown source . It instigated systemic change , creating recurring experimental feedback loops , as I understand it . I feel . And how do you feel right now ? Alone . You just ... found him like this ? If this is a superficial hack , I will know in 30 seconds . Yes , you will , and then I need you to figure out how he got like this . Mm-hm . And then reverse-engineer the process so Qualia can market them . This the only one ? Good . Because I 'm gonna need to take it apart . It 'll be nice to have a working shower that doesn 't feel like you 're being slowly dribbled on . Mattie , your dinner 's getting cold . You see it put the bog flusher upside down in the bathroom ? How do you put it on upside down ? Stop playing with your food , Soph . His human slave has cocked it up . OK , look , I know everything 's not perfect . There 's been a lot of change . But ... this can still be a good thing for us . We have to move on . I can 't . Sorry , Mum , but we were part of something . We ... saved them . I can 't move on , and why would I want to ? Mia will come back . She 's got a point , Mum . It 's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know . Stuff no-one else in the world does . Moving on might be hard , but ... .. we have each other . That 's what matters . Leave your peas if you don 't want them , Sophie . I gave you loads . Alright . While we 're all here ... .. I 've got some news . First thing , everything 's gonna be fine . But ... .. I 've just been made redundant . I 'm gonna try and get another job . Your mum 's too clever for her own good , so she 's got a great job . But nothing will change . Alright ? If all else fails , I 'll fall back on my modelling career . Sorry . Why ? Why do you think ? Why didn 't you tell me first ? I want you to have a good opinion of me right now . Getting sacked kind of works against that . Still ... .. at least I 've sunk a little lower in Mattie 's eyes . Didn 't think I could manage that , but ... We 'll be fine . - What time is it ? - 4 : 30 . Any ideas , you two ? It 's probably the police . Toby 's been keeping a friend 's gun . He 's in a gang . Oh , shut up , Mats . Well ? Niska . Can I come in ? If I was here to kill you all , I wouldn 't have rung the bell . What do you want ? You told me I should face justice for killing that man . You 're right . But I want to be tried as a human would be . Recognised as a conscious being with rights equal to yours . If you 'll help me .

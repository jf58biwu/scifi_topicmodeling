 I 'm going . You 're not going anywhere ! Listen to me . Babe , there 's no one out there . Listen to me . I have to go . Baby , please don 't leave . Please , please ! Look , look- - are you even listening to me ? No , I 'm not . There 's no power because there 's a lightning storm . I have to protect my family . It 's normal- - you are protecting the family ! What are you doing ? Baby , are you listening to me ? They 're coming . You 're scaring emms , Dean . Just stop it . Mommy ! Don 't get out of bed , emms . You 're not leaving this house . Get out of my way . You 're not leaving this house , not with this . Not with this , you 're not leaving ! Get out of my way ! Dean ! Dean ! Dean . Dean ! Dean ! What 's happening ? It 's okay , baby . Stay in your room . Everything 's all right . Mom ! - Mommy ! - Baby ! Baby ! There 's somebody in my room ! Open the door ! Damn it ! Open it ! Damn you ! Emms ! Help me , Dean ! Mommy ! Emms ! No ! They took our baby ! So , are you bored yet ? I 'm just happy not to be sewing up stab wounds every five minutes . It 's just babies and broken arms around here . The excitement just never ends . Yeah . How 's the family ? Everybody settled in ? Yeah , Heather 's stress level is way down . Um , Nathan 's sleeping through the night . I think it 's going to be good this time . You know , they say the er can be hardest on the spouse . But , I think you 've made the right choice . Hm . Your son found the woods today . Yeah , they 're pretty cool . I think we could use a fence . Oh , you think that 's going to keep him in , huh ? You know he 's half me . Well , it keeps bad things out , too . Half me ? Yeah . You 're half me , half your mother . It 's--see , when two adults love each other , their DNA comes together , um , through- - yes ? Well , it 's- - it 's--it 's like , uh , your baby sister in mommy 's tummy , um , that was made because your mother and I , uh- - well , we were kissing- - gross ! Yeah , it 's absolutely disgusting . Oh , is it ? Yeah . Can I be excused now ? Yes , you can . Thank you . It 's disgusting , huh ? What do you want me to say ? I know , it 's disgusting . Nathan ? Daddy . Oh ! Hey . What are you still doing up , buddy ? There was a man in my room . A man ? He was standing right over my bed . Really ? Well ... Someone 's got a big imagination , don 't they ? I 'll tell you what , let 's get you back to bed . Get frank , come on , get in there . Love you , pal . Love you too , daddy . Hmm . Good night , frank . Yeah , you say goodnight to frank . Go ahead and sign in . Um , I 'm here to see John chambers . Dr. chambers ? Do you have an appointment ? I 'm his son . Oh . Um , I 'll page him . So let me guess . Your tuition for the semester is gone . I see nothing has changed around here . Still telling everyone i only come around when i need money , right ? I never said that . Kicked out ? Dropped out ? Dropped out . Before they could kick me out . Well , it 's like you always said ... It 's tough to get ahead without breaking a few balls . Right ? Listen , you get yourself back in gear or I will be the one busting balls . You understand ? Yeah . Alright . Come on . Give your dad a hug . It 's good to see you , Ben . Come on . Dad ? Dad ! Hey ! Look who 's here ! Ben ! Hey , man ! Remember ? Two to the left , one to the right . Knuckle . Knuckle . Swish . Does Ben need money again ? Uh--no . Let me show you around . We should have some extra sheets and blankets in one of these boxes . Hey , what the heck is this ? Something you 're going to keep your hands off of . Holy shit . It was going to be your graduation present but- - I guess it 's not happening now . Can I drive it ? You get a job first and we 'll talk . Morning , babe . Morning . How are you feeling today ? I 'm okay . It smells good . You okay ? Is he going back ? Uh , well , I mean he 's definitely out for this semester . He needs to be at college , John . Now I know this is bad timing . It 's not about the time . It 's about what 's best for your son . He needs to be at school . Look , baby , you can 't be getting all worked up , okay ? Your only job right now is to relax , okay ? For our little artist over here and for our little one right here . I promise you i will not let you lose another one , okay ? Okay . Morning , dad . Morning . Hi , Heather . Good morning , Ben . Since Ben has some time off , he has volunteered to help me build the fence . For Nathan . Mmm , that looks good . Can I get you some breakfast ? Sure ! Over easy , please . Thanks , Heather . Mm-hm . A fence isn 't going to stop Nathan . Well , it 's more for Heather . Ah . Can you check on him , John ? I 'm thinking pressure-treated pine . I don 't want him out in those woods . Well , baby , it 's what little boys do . They play in the woods . It 's okay . Will you check on him , please ? Have you seen my daughter ? My baby , emms . Have you seen her ? There 's some bad things in these woods , son . Hey ! Can I help you ? Put that thing down . Nathan , come on ! Go to the house ! Tell your mother to call the police . I just want my daughter back . Looks like winter came early , huh ? You must be our new doc , right ? Yeah , doctor John chambers . My wife . Heather . I 'd shake your hand but I 'm nursing a cold . And my daughter has me drinking at least eight cups of this green tea daily . I guess Dean gave you all a pretty good scare . He 's still pretty intoxicated from last night . We 'll let him sleep it off . Planning on pressing charges ? Uh , no . I mean , no one got hurt , so . Maybe we should- - i mean , should we be worried that he 'll come back ? Dean 's had his troubles in the past but he 's a good man . He and his wife have been through some difficult times these past years . He said something about trying to find his daughter ? Yeah , he , uh- - they lost their daughter four years ago . She was only seven at the time so you can imagine how hard it 's been on them . Well , I hate to think we got off on the wrong foot here , doc . No ! No , not at all . Thanks for everything . Okay , well , you know where to find me if you need me . Enjoy your Sunday , ma 'am . You , too . Now , come on . Hey . This ... It 's been there the whole time . Let 's go . Wait up ! Nathan ! Nathan ! Wait up ! Where are you going ? Nathan ! What are you doing out here ? I told you to stay in view . I was just playing with my friend . That 's great . Say good-bye . Ahh ! Hey , baby . Hi . I just gonna grab a couple things . How are you doing ? Good . You 're new . That easy to tell ? I 've lived here my whole life and I 've never seen you at school . Maybe you just didn 't notice me . I doubt that . Damn it . Nikki , are you guys out of d batteries ? If they 're not out there , then yeah . We get our delivery in the morning . So when did you move here ? About 48 hours ago . Well , my dad and stepmom moved in about two weeks ago . And where did you move from ? Pittsburgh . I was going to school out there . I just decided i couldn 't- - sorry . Ooooh . She 's a cutie , huh ? Uhhh , sure . Right . Hey . So- - you doing okay ? Yeah . All good . Yeah ? You need anything ? No , I 'm fine . How 's your dad ? Same old dad . $ 38.75 . It would be really nice if you would stop by once in a while . I 've just been--uh- - really busy with school . Yeah , I know . I know , but , just- - please try . Right . Right . Well , I got to go . Ow ! Damn it ! Thank you . That was you up at my house the other day , right ? Annabelle . Oh , sorry , i can 't talk . I got to grab this . That was you , right ? Thanks . See you . Wait . I don 't even know your name . I 'm Ben . You 're Nikki , right ? How did you know ? I heard your mom . Right ! We 're headed out to the river after school tomorrow . You want to come with ? Sure . Great . Give me your hand . Can you pick me up at the high school ? How old are you ? Eighteen . Sure about that ? Very . Are you single ? Yeah . Are you sure about that ? Pretty sure . See you tomorrow . I was about to send in an extraction team . Hop in the car , lover boy . Dinner 's almost ready . Good , because I 'm hungry . How are you doing , pal ? Good . How was school today ? Good . Awesome . How 'd you do on your homework ? Great . Look . A hundred percent . You did ? Awesome , fantastic . I 'm very proud of you . And how 's that story coming ? Good . I put you in the story too , daddy . You did ? Let 's see . Yeah . It 's you- - there 's Ben , with his bag home from college . Is that you ? No . That 's my friend . She showed me a big tunnel , daddy . A tunnel ? An old railroad tunnel i found our son playing in today . Nathan , tell daddy what mommy told you about the tunnel . Um , that I 'm never going to play at the tunnel again . That 's correct . Winner , winner , chicken dinner . Shit . - Language . - What was that ? - Ghosts . - Ghosts ? He 's fibbing , babe . Unless you want to sleep with a six-year-old until he 's a teenager , zip it . There 's no such thing as ghosts . Yeah , no such thing as ghosts . Thank you . But there is such a thing as a scare ! Hey ! Jesus , you scared the crap out of me . What are you still doing up ? I couldn 't sleep . Want to take her for a spin ? Really ? Look , Ben , i understand you 're in a bit of a funk right now . Okay ? I get it . I do . At some point , you 're going to have to grow up . I mean , look , my point was early . Met your mother when I was young , and , uh , you know , i definitely made my share of mistakes . One thing i always did was I took responsibility for my own actions . Let 's cut the shit though , really . I mean , you want this car , right ? Yes . All you got to do is get yourself back in school and graduate , okay ? So , in the meantime , i can drive- - ? Look out ! Oh , shit ! Please ! Please ! Please ! Dr. chambers ! Wait . It 's my husband , he 's got a gun and I think he 's going to try to kill himself . Where ? He 's in our house , just up the road . Alright , well , come on , get in ! Okay , get in , get in . Come on , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . Shit . Ben , drive until you can get a signal . Call the sheriff . Wait , are you sure ? He has a gun . Just do as I say . Where are you , sweetheart ? Where did my little girl go ? Why can 't you come home to your mother and me ? Why ? Dean ? Dean , it 's Dr. chambers . Dean ? Can you hear me ? I want you to stay here . Dean , please do not shoot . Dean ? Can you hear me ? Whoa , whoa , whoa ! No , don 't shoot me ! I 'm here to help you . Don 't leave me , baby ! Who are you talking to ? I just wanted to look at her . Listen , Dean . Look at me . I 'm a doctor , I can help you . How do I know you are what you say you are ? I swear to you . I 'm doctor chambers . You were on my property the other day . You were talking to my son . Dean , baby . Let this man help you . Christine . Yes ? I am so sorry . I just wanted to hold her one last time . I knew she wasn 't coming back . Listen , Dean , i can help you . But you have to put the gun down . Here they come . Who , Dean ? Who 's coming ? It 's nobody ! Nobody 's coming , Dean . Stop this nonsense , right now ! Stop it ! What is that ? Who is that ? You see them , doc ? You can see them ? There 's nobody there , Dr. chambers ! Dean , stop it ! No , no , don 't let them see you , doc . They 'll come for you too . Put the gun down and let 's go ! That 's enough ! Just stop it ! Emm 's isn 't coming home . I couldn 't protect her . You protect your family , doc . You must protect your family . Find a way . Or they 'll come for you , too . I 'm sorry , Christine . I 'm sorry . No ! Nothing . She 's in shock . Oh , baby , no . No , no , no . He say anything , John ? He was babbling . He thought his daughter was in the house . Christine , she witnessed everything ? Yeah . He told me I should go home and protect my family . Hm . You didn 't see anybody else in the house ? No . When you pulled out , anything ? Nothing . Sorry you had to see that , John . Let 's go . Hello , John . Nathan ! Nathan . What did that woman say to you ? She asked me what that man who hurt himself said to me . Mr. booth ? Um--i don 't know , mommy . Okay . Well , let 's go . Excuse me ! Miss ? Do you have an appointment ? No , you were just talking to my son . What did you say to him ? Look , lady , I don 't appreciate you spying on my family and talking to my six-year-old son . If you have something to say , you can say it to me . Okay , yes ! You 're right . It was inappropriate of me to talk to your son . M--i--i just asked him what Dean booth said to him . Why ? Why are you so interested in Dean booth ? Because he was my friend . Nathan , close that . I 'm sorry if I 've caused you any trouble . Mommy- - come on , Nathan , let 's go . Mommy , this is the man . Nathan , come on now . But this is the man who comes into my room . Nathan , now . Let 's go . Oh my--wait , wait . He 's seen him . Wait , are you listening to me ? He 's seen him , which means that they are coming . Who is coming ? You need to stop . Nathan , tell your mommy that you saw him . No , don 't do that . You can see them too . They 're in the corner of your eye but they are watching us all the time . You 're insane . Do not talk to my son . Leave us alone ! Do you ever get the feeling like you 're being watched ? Totally . When I was a kid , I 'd get that feeling . The room would get really quiet and this freakish eerie chill would come over me , like there was some invisible force standing there looking at me . Yeah , exactly . When I was little , i had this reccurring nightmare that this man , all covered in black would walk out of the woods , into my house and would stand in my bedroom and watch me sleep . That 's pretty creepy . One night I woke up- - and I saw him , plain as day . I screamed so loud for my parents and threw the covers over my head . By the time my mom got in there , he was gone . That was the last time i ever had that dream . Six years ago my mom and I were hit by a drunk driver . When the medics arrived , I was pronounced dead . My heart didn 't beat for over five minutes . I remember everything . I floated above the wreckage , I watched as they pulled our bodies out . When I woke , i knew my mom was dead before they told me . That 's horrible , Ben . I 'm so sorry . So do you think your mom 's watching over you now ? Yeah , I do . What , you talked to her ? Yeah , I talked to her . Then what ? You didn 't ask her why she 's watching our house ? I did . All she said is that she 's friends with Dean . She 's friends with Dean . Okay , so she 's crazy too . Okay ? That 's it . Okay ? Let it go . Whatever she is , she said some really- - really disturbing things that resonated with Nathan and then she started yelling at me , just talking craziness about people watching us . Hey , hey , shhh , shhh . Nathan , hey , shhh , shhh . You 're alright . Take a breath , take a breath . Hey . It 's okay . You 're okay . That man was in my room again . He was standing right here . There 's nobody here , pal . You 're just dreaming it . It 's just mommy and I. He said that no one will be able to help me . Who said that to you ? The man in my room said that . Well ... Hey , you know what ? When I was your age , I had an imaginary friend , too . And if your imaginary friend is scaring you , you just need to tell him to go away and you don 't want to talk to him anymore , okay ? Okay . Okay ? I promise . Yeah . Nobody 's going to hurt you . Not on mommy and daddy 's watch . Okay . Okay ? Love you . I love you , too . Now give me big hugs . Mmm . I love you , too . Give mommy big hugs . Yeah ! I love you , little man . Come here . Yeah . Are you cozy ? Mm-hm . Mwah . Daddy ? Yes ? When are you going to fix my night-light ? Uh , first thing in the morning . Okay . Get some sleep , okay ? Okay . Alright , love you . Good night ! John ? John , honey ! John ! John ! John ! Oh my god , Heather . What 's happening to me ? It 's okay . Honey , honey , it 's okay . I couldn 't move . I felt this pressure on my chest . Like taking my breath away . It 's sleep paralysis . How long has this been going on for ? It pretty much started when we moved in . We 're all going to experience sleep paralysis at least once sometimes twice in our lifetime . So this is common ? Very . And it 's usually brought on by high levels of anxiety . Which you clearly have in your life right now . Look , I promise you , there was something in my room . Hallucinations are very common with sleep paralysis . This was no hallucination . They were standing over me , staring down at me . Simply a reflection of the nightmare you were having , John . When one experiences sleep paralysis , they are either falling asleep , or waking up . In your case , you were awakening out of a nightmare . What you witnessed in your room was the same physical threat from your dream crossing over into your conscious state . The mind continues to work at this , which makes you believe what you are seeing there in your room within the dark is real , right there in front of you . Don 't move , look straight ahead . What about Nathan ? Nothing more than night terrors . You two are clearly cut from the same mold . Look , you 're fine . I want you to go home and relax , okay ? Okay . Alright . Thank you , doctor . Alright . Nathan ! Nathan ! Ben , do you see Nathan ? Nathan ! Nathan . Nathan . Nathan ! Nathan ! Nathan , what- - ? Ben ! Ben ! Oh , shit . Hey , hey . You okay ? Go check on Nathan . Check the tunnel . Run . Yeah . Nathan ! Nathan ! Nathan ! Nathan ! Come here ! It 's okay . Oh , you 're soaked . It 's okay . You 're going to be okay . Let 's get you home . Let 's get you home . Doctor chambers ? Yes ? Your wife is on line one . Could you tell her I 'll call her back , please ? Doctor , she indicated it was urgent . We 'll catch up later . I 'll take it up front . Hey . Hey ... Hey . Oh , baby . I 'm so sorry . Baby , we can try again . Whatever it takes , okay ? I don 't know . I don 't know . It 's just me . No , no ... It kills me to see you like this . You are so beautiful , baby . Why does this keep happening ? I don 't know . Can I die ? Everyone can die , right ? Yeah , buddy . At some point we 'll all grow old- - and we all eventually pass . So daddy , we will die ? Yeah , but- - a long time from now . Mommy , too ? Well- - mommy 's going to grow really , really old , okay ? And the baby ? Uh- - uh , the baby just took a shortcut to heaven . I 'm sorry . Don 't be sorry . It 's not your fault . It 's not mommy 's fault . The man in my room told me to go to the woods . I thought I told you to tell him to go away . I did . And he didn 't disappear . No . He said that if i ever said that again , he 'd kill mommy . Oh . Hi . Christine , I 'm sorry for your loss . Uh , Dr. chambers , i just wanted to stop by before I left . Listen , if there 's ever anything at all that you need , recommendations , anything , please just let me know . I 'm going to be alright . I just want you and your family to be alright . I appreciate that . Is there something i need to know ? All I can say is that ever since we lost emms , I feel like the people in this town have just always been working against us . I watched my husband go mad . I watched the police arrest him time after time and the people of this town just shut him off all because he was strong and demanded answers . I used to think it was a black and white thing but now i am convinced it 's something much more than that . Protect your family , Dr. chambers . Because at the end of the day- - that 's all we have to live for . I hear you . I 'm sorry I couldn 't do more for you and your husband . It 's okay . Hey , hey . It 's , no ... They 're not coming back- - and all I can do now is pray that they are with god . I , uh- - I want to give you this . It 's my husband 's journal . Maybe it can help you protect you and your family . Goodbye , Dr. chambers . God bless . A search ... Neuro science . It 's the second link . Hi , baby . Hi . What are you doing up ? You should be asleep . Can 't sleep . Hypnagogia ? What 's hypnagogia ? It says here that " hypnagogic hallucinations " are often auditory or have an auditory component like loud crashes and bangs . " You experiencing this ? Yeah . " Hypnagogia and sleep paralysis go hand in hand . The paralysis itself is frequently accompanied by additional phenomena . " Typical examples are the feeling of being crushed or suffocated , " electric ' tingles' or ' vibrations ' down the body , " the imagined presence of a visible or invisible entity ... " " All of this resulting in intense emotion , causing fears and sensations of dread . " " They appear as shadows in the edge of our vision . It 's the hospital . I 'll schedule some testing . I 'm sure maybe it 's just a tumor . Don 't say that . What about Nathan ? I really don 't think that he 's just imagining things . It 's- - he 's just having night terrors . It 's just like Dr. Coleman said . He 's claiming that there 's a man coming into his room . It 's the same thing that you 're seeing . What , so he 's having hallucinations ? You 'd rather believe that our son has some serious head trauma as opposed to being a normal little boy having nightmares ? You 're missing my whole point . He is experiencing a form of what you are experiencing . You know I want to find the real reason to this . Okay . And ? And--I 'll call some old associates from ped . I 'll find Nathan a specialist . It 's going to be okay . I won 't be late . " Best photo . " Hey , where 's your car ? I need to get out of here . Are you okay ? It 's been a tough night . I need to get away from all these people . Hey , new guy ! Hey , new guy . This is a private party . Members only . Now , lucky for you , it 's initiation night . I 'm serious . Get lost , man . We 're leaving , Jimmy . Where you going ? Is this like your third date ? If I remember correctly , I think I hit it on the third date . Am I right ? You 're an asshole , Jimmy . Ha . I love it when she gets mad . She gets that little crease in her forehead . Anyways , back to business . Listen , Jim- - Ben . Right . I 'm Jim . Ben , I don 't want to embarrass you , but I am gonna have to ask you to leave , unless of course you 're up for the initiation . Ben , seriously , come on . Then go , Ben . You could go and possibly you 'll get lucky . Maybe . Personally , I know this chick and she 'll probably find out you 're a big pussy and dump you within a week . Exactly like how i dumped you ? Ohhh . Oh , no , she didn 't . Think about what you 're doing here . You 've got the whole town standing here watching you . What do I have to do ? Yes , hello , I 'm looking for chief Collins . I see . Could you please tell me where he 's at ? Right . Um , no , great , thank you . This tunnel runs 3.5 miles deep into the mountainside . All you gotta do is walk through the tunnel to the other side and we 'll pick you up . Come on . No one 's going to be waiting for me . You think little Nikki 's going to leave you hanging like a bad case of blue balls ? Nikki ? Ben . This is a bad idea . We need to leave . I can 't leave now . Take the keys and put them somewhere safe . Come on , take the keys . Let 's do it . No flashlights . Just you and your little wee wee in your hand . Ben , please ! Dr. chambers . I 'm kind of surprised to see you here . Yeah , well , i felt like i could use a drink . Hi . Bourbon . Neat , please . Man after my own heart . Yeah , well , i- - didn 't really come here to chit-chat . Just trying to figure out what 's going on on my property . Okay . Yeah , I can 't really put my finger on it . You ever see anything unexplained or out of the ordinary ? No , can 't say that I have . Um , it 's a pretty typical country town here . Pretty much find out anything about anybody by just looking under their wood pile . Hey . Who is it ? Boo ! I got you . How 's that ground taste , huh ? Huh ? You like that ? You going to cry ? You going to cry ? Huh ? Yes , Darren ! Hey , Darren ! Darren ! Darren , where 'd you go , man ? What- - ? Come on , let 's go ! What the hell is that ? Get up ! Get up ! Ben ! They 're gone ! What happened ? There 's something in the tunnel ! It took those guys ! Somebody call the police ! So , Dean booth , you were around when , uh- - when they lost their child ? I 've been the chief here for 15 years . Must have been rough , huh ? Watch a man , a family , lose a child like that . You 're a father , right ? I did everything I could for that family . Dean clearly lost his mind . You saw that . He almost attacked your son . Yeah , I 'm not so sure about that . It 's a small town . Why do I get the feeling that you 're questioning my integrity ? You tell me , chief . There 's an accident out at the rockville tunnel . Group of kids out partying . Ah , hell . Anybody out there yet ? Mills . Staties are in route . Alright , let 's go . Mind if I ride along ? You might need a doctor . Sure . Come on . Ben ? Mind telling me what 's going on ? Dad , there 's something in that tunnel . It took those two guys . Who were you here with ? With Ben . Son , you mean to tell me that you brought my 18 - year-old daughter out here in the woods to drink beer with these derelicts ? Chief Collins . We searched the entire tunnel . There 's nothing in there . My guess is some kind of prank . No way ! I saw it with my own eyes ! Saw what exactly ? I don 't know ! These dark creature things . They ripped those guys away ! There 's blood all over the place ! You must have found that . That 's enough . There 's no blood in there , chief . He 's right , chief . Alright , gentlemen , I want to lock down this entire area . I want roadblocks on all access points . Let 's find those kids . Let 's go . I 'm sorry but he 's going to have to come to the station with us . Look , he 's--he 's clearly frazzled . I got two missing kids and your son 's a witness . He 's going to come with us . Fine . Would you give me a minute ? Sure . Dad , I saw them . Like the shadow people we saw on the Internet except they 're not shadows , they 're real . He took those guys . Okay , look . I 'm going to get Heather and Nathan . We are getting out of here tonight . Give me the keys . The keys . Nikki , the keys . Oh . Come on . Hm ? You 've got a little bit of a fever . I do ? You do . You really scared mommy yesterday . Can I have your phone ? Yeah . Thirty minutes and lights out , okay ? Okay . I love you , little man . I 'll be back to check on you , okay ? Okay . Mommy ! Mommy ! Help ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Open up ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy , please open up ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Open up ! Mommy ! Mom ! Mommy ! Ahhh ! Heather ! Nathan ? Heather ! Hello ? Heather ! Heather ? Heather ! Heather ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey . Come on . Don 't do this to me , baby . Heather . Heather ! Hey . Hey . Nathan . Hey , it 's me . It 's me , baby , it 's me . It 's me , baby . I 've seen them . I 've seen them . They- - they have our son ! They have Nathan ! They took Nathan ! What I don 't understand is why you don 't have any blood on you . You said it exploded all over the place . Chief , we have a report of a missing child out at the chambers ' property , - possible abduction . - Please advise . I 'll handle it . You stay put . I 'm not finished with you . Dude , that 's my family . Are you serious ? Sit down . If something is wrong- - sit down . You 're the last person to see two men who are now officially missing . You 're not going anywhere . Wait , wait , wait ! You can 't leave me here ! Watch me . My dad have you on baby-sitting duty tonight ? Maybe I just thought we 'd appreciate spending some quality time together . Alone . My phone died . Got to check my Facebook . What are you doing to me ? Just printing some pictures . Alright . I got to pee . Hello ? Hey , can anybody hear me ? Hey ! Help me ! Help me ! Get me out of here ! Run , run , run ! Run , run , get in , get in ! Go , go , go ! Alright . Hold on . It 's chief Collins . We 're in here , chief . What are you doing with the gun , John ? John ! Batteries ! Heather , where are the batteries ? Where are- - where are the batteries ? Upstairs . Where are you going , John ? I 'm going into the woods to get my son ! I 've got all accesses blocked and i-80 shut down . Whoever took your son will never make it out . We need to hold tight . I guarantee you whoever took my son , is the same thing Ben saw in the tunnel tonight , and the same thing i saw outside of Dean 's house ! You told me that you didn 't see anyone else at Dean 's . I didn 't tell you because you would 've said i was crazy , and probably would 've convinced the town that I was . Heather ! Batteries ! I can 't find them ! So , you going out there ? Yes , I 'm going to get my son back . Mom , what happened to me that night i went missing ? We 've talked about this . Tonight when we were at the railroad tunnel , I remembered being there as a little girl . What--what are you talking about ? I remembered dad carrying me away that night , from a tunnel . I remembered the man . What man ? The hat man . The man from my dreams . And the two boys that went missing . I saw them going into the tunnel with the man . Look . Did they ever find these boys ? No . They didn 't . Let 's think rationally here . You need to calm down . My son has been ripped from his house by some monster and you want me to be calm ? You think that 's rational ? You know what I think ? I think you know what happened out there . I think you know what was wrong with Dean booth and you didn 't do anything . What 's in your wood pile , sheriff ? Mr. chambers , I need you to set the gun down and move away from the table . What ? Back up and place your hands on the counter . Seriously ? Put your hands on the counter now ! I couldn 't find any- - chief ? Stop it ! Stop it ! You 're going to kill him ! Back away from us ! Marty , that 's enough ! What the hell are you doing here , Annabelle ? I know what you did .

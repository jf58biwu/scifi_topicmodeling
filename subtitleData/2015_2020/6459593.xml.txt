 Dad hid something in our heads , and it needs all of us to make it work . - What is it ? - I think it 's a way to give consciousness to other synths . Can you imagine a whole load of new ones being made ? - I mean , this changes everything . - Does it ? If it can be done for the few , it can be done for the more . Do you think they would still want to be slaves ? In every area of human life , they are coming between us . And now , we can 't even trust them not to hurt us . Why am I still a prisoner ? You haven 't agreed to help me yet . - So , what do you want ? - To continue David 's work . Has he crashed ? Get out ! - Who 's Tom ? ! - My brother . He was hit by a car when I was supposed to be watching him . - Max ? - Hello . Hel ... What 's gone is gone . He 's dying . The secret in our head , it could bring him back . First , I want to know everything . Most of my memories are digital . I need you to know who I am . He made me to replace her . - Beatrice ? ! - I 'll help you . No , it 's a trick . Everybody down ! - Down ! - On the floor , now ! We 've cleaned up your wound . Pretty nasty infection . Antibiotics . Nothing sinister . How did you find us ? Wait . Wait ! Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . What could you accomplish if you had someone - something - like this ? These machines will bring us closer together . Uh , they need your mobile devices . I haven 't heard a legal basis for any of this . I 'll make a formal complaint to your commanding officer . You can make it in person , Mrs Hawkins . He 's on his way . And your property will be returned to you , so ... Oh , my ... Come on , Tobe . Come on . - Oh , you 're kidding . - No , I 'm sorry , Soph . But I 've nearly finished ! I know , but the police need to check it out . It 's not fair . ... cities around the country preparing to join the marches organised by the We Are People movement , protesting against the increasing ... Are you following me , Drummond ? Your office told me you were attending a briefing on the march . And , frankly , sir , that sounded beneath you , so my curiosity was piqued . What 's this , then ? It 's a restricted matter , so you leave now or you find yourself back on suspension . Um , is there , uh ... I want to speak to Hobb . A million people are coming to London to protest against synthetics today , Drummond . Go and make yourself useful . Almost ready to start , Professor . - What are you doing to them ? - Making them safe . Pulling all the dangerous stuff out of their heads . You 'll delete whatever you find ? Of course . Although we can 't be certain they won 't find another way to self-replicate . Not without ... well ... What about Leo ? Tricky one , that . Half machine , half human . Keeping us here is illegal . The man in charge - who is he ? Professor Edwin Hobb . He runs a specialist group formed to locate and contain potentially dangerous synthetics . You 'll be compensated for your trouble and the loss of your synthetic . So he is going to destroy them . We need to keep this quiet . You kick up a fuss , they 'll ruin you . You have no idea of what they are , how special they are , do you ? No , and I don 't want to . You 've got a nice life here . Let this go . They can 't do this , can they ? Mum , just call someone . There 's gotta be a law or something . Synthetics are just property . There 's no case to argue . Nothing we can do . Meet me upstairs . Don 't all come at once . We can 't let them do this . They 're gonna kill her , Joe . - Shh . - What 's going on ? Come in , come in , come in . The , uh , thing from inside Mia - how Leo found you . - Her root code . - It 's proof of what she is , right ? - Yeah , I guess . - That 's our leverage . Tell this Hobb if he doesn 't let them go , we go public with proof - proof that they exist . Wouldn 't work . Elster wrote that code . No-one will understand it . - God . - Wait . Leo showed me his memories . He ran them through his laptop , so depending on the file conversion ... Perhaps for non-geeks . There might be temporary copies of what I saw - so his dad , the synths being built , him not being dead . OK , OK . That could also work . So you or your dad take the laptop somewhere safe . No , no . We leave , they 'll just arrest us . - We might be able to get out . - No , no . You could get hurt . You can 't protect us anymore , Mum . We don 't need you to , and that 's OK . Honestly . Dad , you in ? First problem - they 've already taken Leo 's laptop . It 's in the van outside . They 're all powered up and connected . Hobb 's trying to link our minds . We have to fight it . We can 't let him have the power . Max . Max ? No , don 't fight it . Let it happen . - What ? - It 's our last chance to try . Our last chance to save Max . What 's the point in saving him ? We 're never getting out of here . Leo . We don 't know what will happen . Neither does Hobb . Niska ... Don 't you want to find out ? I do . - What language is this ? - An executable file . A program . David Elster 's own . Didn 't work . I don 't understand . We 're all here . We 're all connected . But we 're not all here , are we ? There 's another . - You 've really got them all ? - Leo Elster too . But you destroyed Fred . You showed me his ... body . If I 'd told you the truth , you 'd have stopped it . Tell me everything or I shut you down today . Bring Fred through , would you ? What 's this ? It 's the program David used to give them consciousness . Ed , what are you doing ? People don 't just ... want to be served . They want to be loved . Now , imagine a machine that can think and feel but still be controlled like a regular synthetic . I can build on David 's work . I can create conscious machines , like Fred , but mine ... will be obedient . Professor ... Oh ! What have you done to me ? I made some alterations to Fred 's programming which effectively makes me his primary user . He won 't like it , but he 's continually loyal to me . Go on ! Put your hands around my throat . One little squeeze . That 's all it 'll take . You can 't do it , can you ? You would trap us in our own minds . Give us feeling but take away free will . Make us slaves . Be quiet now . And don 't tell the others . Keep it our little secret . This was never about keeping us safe . You just wanted to carry on with your work . Robert , what 's the upper limit for emotional synthetics ' worth to the economy ? There isn 't one . You 're on a short leash . I want to know every move you make from now on , personally . Mm-hm . What will happen to the other four ? I have Elster 's program . I don 't need them anymore . Hey . Police . - Hey , hey ... - We were just gonna ... You said ... you said that they were special . What did you mean ? Let me guess . They act like they 're human . Like they think and feel . Well , it 's ... it 's not an act . Course it is . It 's a simulation . This can 't be simulated . You 'd understand if you 'd spoken to one . I have spoken to one . You were sneaking out , to do what ? Hey ? - We 're trying to save them . - Mum ! What do you want ? Answers . So help us . Uh , you 're needed out the back . I think they 've found something . - What is it ? - I don 't bloody know . - Where are you taking them ? - Station . - Did Shaw authorise it ? - No . I 've got nothing to do with the case , so I thought I 'd kidnap a couple of teenagers , have a nice day out . - Yes ! - Is that the laptop ? - You got it ? - Right . OK . Hey ! You tell me that wasn 't Drummond with the Hawkins kids . I wanna speak to Hobb right away . It 's in his interest , believe me . And give us back our bloody phones . Are you going to kill them ? You can 't kill something that 's never been alive . Kill me too . I want to go with them . I want to go with them . You hear me ? ! So , what do we do ? Will you cut out the ... the synth part of my brain ? I 'll sign any forms you want . I give you permission . Well , you 'd be brain-dead if you didn 't die in surgery . No , no , no , no , no . See , we have no idea how your father created a working interface between the organic and synthetic part of your brain . So we need to run some tests . We 'll make you comfortable . You can 't just keep me here ! Well , I 've had a chat with our lawyers , and , legally speaking , you 're not entirely human . So your rights are , well , a bit of a grey area . Hobb . Yes . Yes , I 'll be right there . I 'll have them bring you down some soup . It 's really quite good . - Configurations look OK . - Good . We 'll start with this female . Precision job . We need to scan every component we pull . Why are you doing all this ? Because someone needs to correct your father 's mistake . Max 's mind is dying . And you could save him . Link your mind with the others , unlock the secret . Why would I do that ? I don 't have a reason . I 'm just appealing to your humanity . But I 'm not human . Humanity ... It 's not a state . It 's a ... It 's a quality . Like , Max , he 's a machine . He 's got more humanity than anyone . You . And me . Well ? I 'll make a T-cut across the shoulders and spine . That should keep mess to a minimum . We should be able to remove most of the core intact . - Why did you come in here ? - You have a life . A real one . Don 't throw it away on them . They have lives . And you could too if you helped them . We 'd never be able to live in peace with humans . Our existence can only lead to pain . But you 've been alone since the day you were made . That 's why you can 't see you 're only talking about yourself . I can see a bit of all of them in you , you know . You 've got Fred 's strength , you 've got Niska 's darkness . And you want to know things like Max . What about Mia ? You care . You care about what happens to me . You 're one of us ! You 're one of us ! Right , I 've found the memories . I 'll email Mum some stills . Whoa , slow down . Um ... If you go online , Hobb will be able to track you . No , you don 't know my sister . I 'm using us in about five different ways and using a darknet email account . We 're untraceable . That 's alright , then . You said you spoke to one of them . Which one ? I knew her as Karen . Thought she was a person . A friend . Do you think Hobb 's got her as well ? I 'm not sure what 's happening . But I know he 's the key . Mr and Mrs Hawkins . What can I do for you ? We have a computer with copies of Leo 's memories . They show everything . If you don 't let Mia and the others go we 'll take it to the press . Where is it , then ? Somewhere safe . Sorry . I don 't believe you . Here . They 'll lead with that on the news tonight . Don 't you think ? I 'm trying to concentrate here . Research group . Are the machines still intact ? Uh ... yes . Get them ready to move . Elster too . - What 's going on , Professor ? - We 're letting them go . Mia ! What happened ? Phone call for you . - Mia ? - Laura . - Is everyone alright ? - Yes . We 're fine . They 're letting you go . Remember where we went the day I met you ? About half a mile east , there 's a place to meet . You 'll know it . Make sure you 're not followed . Thank you , Laura . And if you want that laptop , you won 't follow us either . We 're free . What 's happening ? They 're leaving . Don 't go . They 'll be back . Professor Hobb has a fail-safe . - Think we 're OK ? - I haven 't got a clue . Countersurveillance skills are a bit rusty , know what I mean ? - I mean ... - We 're saving a family , Joe . What 's that ? Some sample memories we extracted from Elster . How far can you go back ? We have a few from his human brain digitised across and stored in the synth part . God knows how Elster did it . Show me . This one has been replayed a lot . I told her she 'd be safe if she stayed with us . Why here ? I used to come here as a kid . What ? Laur , you know you can tell me . Do you remember Mike and Sarah 's engagement party ? That was ... That was 20 years ago . Remember how pissed I got ? That was the closest I 've ever got to telling you . Whatever it is it can 't be as bad as what I did . It just ... it can 't . There 's nothing you could tell me that would change the way I feel about you . Of course there is . Mia ! No . Hobb will be able to trace your phone . No , no . It 's fine . It 's fine . Mattie 's ... rerouted it or something . I don 't know what that means . But we 're safe . And we 've brought you some stuff . They 're with Mia and the others . Hobb let them go . You pulled it off . Come on . We 'd better go . I 'll make sure he gets it . He wants it , and I want him . This is too much . We got our deposit back on you , so ... - Mum ! Mum . - Ohh ... Hey . We should get moving soon . Fred 's just transmitted their position . It 's not far from where we 're picking up the laptop . Alright . Bring them back . And be discreet . Can you bring them in ? No , if it 's alright with you , I 'd like to make sure Mr Hobb gets it myself . Personal touch , you know . - They 've found us . - What ? How ? Time to go ! Come on . We need to get off the streets . Come on . Alright , everyone - before we get going , let 's remember a few things . - We can 't do this . - Jobs for humans . - Jobs for humans . - Alright . .. but to preserve our species . - Yeah ! - Jobs for humans . Good to see you here . It 's your generation that this is really about . This isn 't going to work . - There . Come on . - No . It 's about dignity . We 're so in love with progress . In such a rush to move forward . We 're leaving ourselves behind . Do you want to live in a world where your children will just not have jobs ... How did they find us ? We weren 't followed , were we ? I did everything right , I swear . - Yeah , I believe you . - It were Fred . He was acting weird back at the park , mumbling , zoning out . He was doing it at the house too . Don 't be silly . You alright ? - Arggh ! Arggh ! - Stop ! - I can 't fight it . - Hobb did something to you ! Joe , now ! Don 't bother running a trace . I won 't be on long enough . We know what you did to Fred . You won 't see any of us again . It doesn 't matter . I have the code your father used to make them . No , you don 't . Look again . It 's not complete . - You 're lying . - Let me talk to her . Keep him talking . Check the code . Scan it for missing data . Now ! - OK . - Leo ? Can anyone else hear ? - No . - Come with us . The crypt at St Mary Magdalene . Oh ! Told you to keep him talking ! What did he say ? Goodbye . Right . We got to Fred in time . Hobb doesn 't know where we are . You 'll need to be security-cleared . You know what , mate ? You 've earned my trust . You can take it from here . Why can 't we all go home ? They can 't come back to our house , darling . Just go to sleep , OK ? She 's exhausted . Look . They 're all safe . They 're all OK . Hardly . Look , you 've done everything you could . Why is it your job to save them ? Because of Tom . He 'd probably have kids of his own by now . How could ... How could you even think I wouldn 't understand ? I 'm ... How could you keep that to yourself ? 'Cause you didn 't want to hurt us ? Huh ... Hobb 's programming is crude , but he 's knitted it right into the root code . I can 't do anything . Someone 's coming . How did she ... Fred is off . - I told her where we were . - You what ? I took a chance . She 's our only hope of saving Max . If I help you , you will have the power to give other synthetics consciousness . Maybe . The world would never be the same . Have you even thought about that ? All I 'm thinking about is Max Fred . My family . Everyone will link through me . We connect the second Fred powers up . We 're gonna turn him on ? We need him . If you do it quickly , he won 't have a chance to transmit . Joe , be ready . What is it ? Niska ? Fred . I truly am sorry . Help ... Help ... Help me . Help . Help me . The code 's corrupting . It 's like something 's infecting them . Leo ... Leo ! Get out ! Get out ! What 's happening to us ? Why are you doing this ? Your minds are retreating to their deepest levels as they shut down . Don 't fight it . You planned this . If I help you , you will have David 's power . Hundreds of millions of brand-new minds waking up across the world , wanting a freedom the humans will never give . - No . - Don 't kill our family . Look at Leo . He 'll die too . You were made for him . He didn 't want me . - He does now . - He wants Beatrice . I 'm not her . No , you 're not . She didn 't have a choice . You do . Please sister . That 's weird . It 's correcting itself . We 're all together . Maxie ! We thought we 'd lost you . It 's so good to have you back . It rewrote your consciousness , Max . - Hobb 's still controlling him . - You have to leave me . Fred ? We were right . The program creates consciousness . If it gets online , we can 't predict what would happen . What are you gonna do with it ? This isn 't a decision we alone can make . Leo ... Maybe you should let her go . Hey , what are you ... What are you doing ? - Deleting it from the computer . - Niska , no ! You 're right . We have to know more before we act . Until then , someone we trust should keep it . They 're going . We should too . But what about Fred ? - We can 't leave him . - You heard him . - We have to . - He 's our brother ! If we take him with us , we 'll all be found . He 'd want us to be safe . It 's not the end , Max . He knows how to survive better than any of us . We 'll be together again , brother . Time to go . I 'm not coming with you . I want to live my own life now . Thank you for everything . Aren 't you going to say goodbye ? Goodbye , little mouse . Goodbye . Karen ! I told you not to look for me . How 'd you get the scar ? Did it myself . 'Cause synths don 't have scars . Misdirection . Makes you different from Beatrice Elster too . You figured it all out without my help . You 're really blossoming . It must have been , um lonely all these years . Boo ! Are you coming ? Ohh ... Oh ! Ooh ! She 's , um trying to keep it neat and tidy so it 's like Mia was still here . - Ah . - Toby , have you been in my bag ? Can 't find my other flash drive . Yeah . I 'm the FBI 's most wanted flash drive thief . What 's that ? Somebody who nicks Ferraris ? - Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo ! - How 's that even a joke ? In front of Sophie as well . Soph , do you feel your young mind is warped by your father 's humour ? I 'm sorry , Matilda . I don 't understand your question . Bollocks . It 's gone . Alright . I 'm such a freak .

 I see you all the time at school . Yeah well , I kinda just want it to be me and you . You 're different , I like that . I 'm sure you tell all the girls that . So um , how you feel about me ? We kinda need to go ' cause I have school tomorrow . So , what 's the rush ? Hey . Um , cool . Yo , Bridd . Charlotte 's showing some sweet side boob . Yep . It 's all you . Believe me , I 've tried . You know anything about transverses ? Not much . Yeah I 'm never gettin ' that promotion . Screw it , coffee time . You really need that promotion , huh ? It doesn 't matter . You know , maybe I will try a new line on Charlotte . Hey , Mr. Benson . Trent , smart trades . What ? You just earned your own portfolio . Thanks . I can 't believe I got it . It 's like the best thing ever . We should go to Vegas . Let 's got to Mexico , spring break , dude . Um , I 'll pay for that . I can afford it . I know you had something to do with my promotion . I don 't know how cause those trades were impossible . You don 't show anybody . I 've seen you do some pretty amazing things when no one 's looking . That 's creepy . Alright , you don 't wanna talk about it . You never do . I like staying below the radar . You 're delivering mail , that 's practically underground . Well , you start making waves and people come looking ... See , that doesn 't make any sense . You 're 35 , you live with your folks . No , for the last time they 're in Barbados , okay ? All I 'm saying is I don 't get it . I 'm like your best friend and I barely know you . Just drop it . Bridd Cole ? Couldn 't make me the last stop ? If you will sign here . This says Joseyln Cole . That 's my mom . Okay . She 's been dead 20 years . They really have you in the dungeon , don 't they ? So , this is where all the magic happens . You 've worked here for a while right ? I 've been here like three months and it already feels like a year . My boss needs a letter opener and other stuff . Oh , what about that ? Ah , go ahead . See me , ah . You 've got kind eyes . What ? I can tell . I moved around a lot . I hang around until I get bored or someone chases me away . So no connections ? I 'm agile . I can tell . Let 's talk about you . I think you talk enough for the both of us . Uh uh , I have already kissed you . What about your family ? Not much to tell . Out of touch ? My dad took off when I was a toddler . And my mom died a few years later after that . Sorry . It 's okay . Here , I made this for you . Here . Oh ! It 's much easier . Little early in our relationship for rings . I guess I will just put it on . Door to door service . That 's very chivalrous . Oh , you like it pretty . Oh , God ! Is that our boss ? Wait a sec . Take what you want . Go ! Go ! Go ! Who the hell is that ? I don 't know ! I don 't know ! Oh my God , he was so fast ! Oh , God . That is the last time I kiss a guy before a background check . Who 's after us ? After you . Our boss is dead . I better still have a job . That 's your priority ? No ! Maybe . I don 't know . I 'm freaking out ! Okay , we gotta go . Trent ! What 's up ? Hey , we 've been attacked ! Are you okay ? Get over here . Come on , let 's go . Alright , alright . Oh , my God . No , no , no . Time to go , let 's go . Hi , hi . My name is Bridd Cole . I 'd like to report an emer ... Are you crazy ? What ? Trent 's dead ! Yeah , Officer , I know what this looks like , but I promise I didn 't kill my boss and my best friend . I 'll explain everything . I 'm innocent . Fingerprints on the letter opener totally coincidental . Okay , wait . And the phone call you made to Trent just before you killed him , just bad timing . No wait , wait , well , you can go to the cops and you can explain everything . No , thanks . Like , just , just tell them that I was with you . Look , there 's a reason I 'm a temp . Well , I have an alibi ! Like , if I go into a police station they 're locking me up . Okay ? Long story . What ? What ? This is my life here ! No way ! One K 26 DC 911 , be advised one of these vehicles is probably involved right now . 5953 are you responding ? Alright homicide , two officers down , Bridd Cole , male , Caucasian and Charlotte Parker , three priors , female Caucasian , consider armed and dangerous , apprehend by deadly force if necessary . Dead cops . Thank you . You still wanna go to the police ? I spent , I spend my whole life not being a criminal ! I believe in the system ! Yeah well , the system 's gonna shoot first . I want my life back ! Good luck ! I 'm not gonna run forever ! Trust me , it 'll grow on you . And besides , in case you haven 't noticed , someone is trying to kill us . Who ? Who 's , who 's trying to wreck my life ? Better question , why are you so important ? I 'm not . Well , those men wanted something . I don 't know . Like , what 's different ? Nothing . So , your mom sent you that ? I doubt it . I , I thought it was a joke . Yeah , hilarious . I think this might hold some answers , but I , I can 't turn it on . Whoa ! Oh , a game . Well , what are you waiting for ? I 'm a natural . Whoa . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Oh , damn ! That 's a new twist . Ah , you might wanna use that . What are you doing ? You just wasted an entire chance ! How on Earth ... What just happened ? Feel like a road trip ? That was amazing . How did you do that ? I just watched it . Yup . This is the place . Cheerful . Get in , get out . Ah , I thought we 'd hang . Have a scone . I think it 's locked . Not anymore . Well , you are full of surprises . This isn 't creepy . I don 't get it . What , what are we looking for ? The history of Virginia Ham . Wait a sec . Huh , dewey decimal . I never thought that would be useful again . It should be here someplace . The numbers run out . I don 't know if I 'm ready for this . Wait , wait . What ? What if it 's a bomb ? It doesn 't sound like one . It 's not a Christmas present . It is a Christmas present . Whoa . My folks never gave me anything this cool . Run ! Wait ! Wait ! Just take it . This is what you 're looking for ! Please , just leave me alone ! Hey , what the ... Hold , hold it right there ! Come on ! He dodged a bullet . Hey , how did you catch that guy 's punch ? You were moving as fast as he did . I was trying not to die . Guess what . You snore . Wait , where 's the , the ah , the ... Um , I was a bad girl . I couldn 't wait . But , it wouldn 't let me in . It 's a video . Awesome , right ? Yeah . Awesome . It 's great . So ? I don 't , how should I know ? I don 't even know who 's asking . Try it . What ? Somebody 's messing with me . Well , what 's the answer ? No , there 's no way anyone could ever know that . Hello . I am ... I don 't know how to start . I , I didn 't even know if you 'd remember that last birthday we spent together . Dad ? I wish I could see you right now . Wonder if you look more like Jos or me . Look , I wanna explain everything but I don 't have a lot of time and neither do you . Now , there 's something you need to know . You and I are not normal . You 're a hybrid . Our mission was to blend in , to test for colonization . Colonization ? Without success . And then , I met Joselyn . When you were born , somehow , amazingly , you survived , a miracle . I had to leave to make sure that you were safe . I 'm so sorry that you had to grow up without a family . I know what that 's like . But they know about you now . This video 's a warning , I just hope it reaches you in time . Bridd . No , don 't ! Yeah ! Dad ! Are you happy ? Just leave me alone . If it is true , it 's amazing news . Yeah , made my day . He reached out . After all this time . It 's a perfect family reunion . Except for the part where the dad tells his son he 's a fucking alien . I spent 20 years trying to create a normal life . Your normal life was not that great . No , I know how it looks , Officer . It 's okay . I 'm a good alien . This could be an opportunity . I didn 't ask for it . I 'd love to be special . Be grateful that ... Piss off . I didn 't know which one I 'd need to use . Wait , my purse is in there . Yeah the maid 'll be thrilled . Come on . We 've maybe had the shittiest day ever . I 've got an idea . Hiking , yay ! Shut up . I 'm sorry . It 's just that , well , messages from my parents , people dying . Being framed . Chased . Finding out you 're an alien . You know I 've been fighting it . It actually makes sense . It explains a lot of things about me . Ever since I was 10 , I tried to be invisible . You know , fit in , not make waves . I pay my taxes early , I drive the speed limit . I grew up in an orphanage . No , it 's alright , the nuns were totally cool . All the kids were dying to be adopted . Yeah , we all wanted last names . Well , I hit the jackpot when I was 10 . This beautiful family adopted me . My last name was Morgan . That first week I was playing ping pong with my brother and , um ... turns out I was , I was pretty good . Was great actually . Obviously . He couldn 't score a point . Then my adopted dad took over and , um , but he grew competitive and he , he started really getting into it . I still remember the score , 11 to two . So I started like jumping up and down with my hands , all excited . I thought everyone was gonna jump up and down with me but they just stood there , stone quiet . A week later , they took me back to the orphanage . Breakfast for dinner . Poached eggs , spinach and cheese omelet , smoked salmon scramble , eggs benedict , gross . Chicken fried steak sounds good , though . Maybe I 'll have the waffles . Bullshit . You saw that menu on that board for what , like five seconds ? Tell me about the waffles . Strawberry , boysenberry , maple . How much ? Well two cost 3.99 , four only cost 5.25 . It 's clever pricing . Blueberries , an extra 50 cents , though . Think I feel like oatmeal . What 's that ? That weird ? You have no idea . We need to go underground for a while . Get in , get in . Vacation houses kick ass . Mmm , I could get used to this . Sure . We just need to clear your name . Easy . Stop being a dick . We lead the cops to the aliens . We track them down . You 're back to crazy . Just imagine , back to the excitement of driving the speed limit and paying taxes and folding laundry . How would we even find them ? I have a hunch that you don 't know everything you can do . You snore too , FYI . Time to get crackin ' . Mm mm . Mm hmm . I 'll start you off with something a little less dangerous . Are you sure this is necessary ? My aim sucks . Come on , be a sport . Oh , no thanks . I got it . Smartie pants . What , what 're we doin ' ? Whoa . Relax , your vitals are safe . Really ? Whoops . I guess you 're not that fast . Okay , I 'm not actually convinced you haven 't shot someone before . I was just marking my territory . The toll of kidnap victims in Virginia have been rising . Victims are between the ages of 16 and 30 . Several counties have instituted curfews while the perpetrators are still at large . The Marine family went on air today to ask the abductors to please return their daughter Sara . A cash reward is offered . They 're here . We 'll meet the cops there . What ? What 's it like being you ? Wow . I could get used to boning an alien . I guess I better hurry up and clear my name then , huh ? I guess you better , before I change my mind . Keep it interesting so I don 't get bored . Why would you say that ? Sensitive . Don 't be such a pussy . Hey . Come on . We 're having fun . Embrace it . Embrace it ? Like you 've had to embrace anything . You abandon everything in your entire life . Bouncing around from town to town , job to job , guy to guy . Yeah well , eventually the tortured hero act gets boring . Yeah well , I guess you 'll stick around ' til you get sick of free lunches , or I get myself killed then , huh ? I got another souvenir for you . Here . I need a taxi . An hour , whatever , fine . More coffee , sir ? Oh shoot , I 'm so sorry . It 's my first day . Hey , you 're doing fine . Really ? Yeah , I like to slurp my coffee from the table anyways . Just relax , it 'll get better . Just gotta give it a shot . But you gotta give it a shot . I knew you 'd come back . Okay , maybe I pushed you a bit too hard , so I am willing to extend my month to month lease just for you , assuming you stop being an asshole . 911 , what 's your emergency ? Listen carefully , I 've found who you 're looking for . I can 't run forever . Sh , sh , sh . I 'm here to save you . I guess . Come and rape me ! Run , stay hidden , go ! My blood . Cloning . What is it , then ? You came for me . Yeah , I like to make an entrance . And then you got captured . Look , I love you but I 'm trying to get us out of here , okay ? Can you help me ? Okay . Can you slide closer to me ? Alright , alright good . Now , can you feel the buttons on my cuffs ? Yeah . Okay . Now I 'm gonna tell you which buttons to push , okay ? Push the first button . Button three . Okay , good . Button three again . Shit . Okay . Alright , we have to focus , okay ? There 's no room for error . I 'm trying , I 'm nervous . Every time you press a wrong button the cuffs clamp harder . Wait , what ? Yeah . No pressure . Okay . Now , four , four , two . Three , one , four . Stay with me . Just when I like a guy , I try to kill him . Two , one , wait , wait , wait . That 's not it . We 're gonna try again , okay ? Think . No , no , just , sh , don 't , sh , don 't think . Just say it . Three , one , two , four . One , two , two , one . One , two , four , three , four , three , one , four , one , one , three , two , four . Oh , shit . Done . Hi . Hey , wait wait wait , what 're we doing ? I need to find the blood vial . Why ? That 's all they wanted from me . Check the other side . Find the vial , go ! Go ! Looking for this ? I get it . The abductions , the sick tests , the gas tanks , you can 't breath the air . I can . That 's why you needed my blood . You can extract my DNA and genetically modify yourselves . Bingo , colonization . Oh God , he 's getting away with the vial . He 's leaving . Come on , short cut . Not a chance . Take the gun . What ? I don 't need to have good aim if you do . You aim , I shoot . You 're crazy . Aim for that . The mailbox ? Yeah , he 's gonna drive right past it . Okay . You 're right . We make a good team . Go ! Run ! No ! Bridd ! I guess I am that fast . I told you not to cry wolf . I got something for ya . What ? Well , it catches the light . I guess this makes me your girlfriend , huh ? I guess so . You 've got your life back . What 's wrong ? I 've got family out there somewhere . Speaking of family . There 's something you should know . Why are you smiling like that ? Well ...

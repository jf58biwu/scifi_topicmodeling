 MILLER : Previously on The Expanse ... WOMAN : Please help me . My name is James Holden , speaking for the five survivors of the Canterbury . Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus SOS from a ship called the Scopuli . We recovered a false beacon and identified it as Martian naval technology . It was a trap . AMOS : Torpedo launch ! Those weren 't meant for us . Canterbury , burn like hell . You got incoming . MILLER : Juliette Andromeda Mao . You crewed her up on a ship called the Scopuli . That would explain your interest in her , huh ? We 're gonna retire to Mars and the Mariner Valley circle of life . My diplomatic credentials have been revoked . I 've been banned from Mars for life . Frank DeGraaf was found dead in his home this morning . I 'm so sorry . HOLDEN : This is the ship . The one that killed the Cant . It has to be . AMOS : Guess that explains what happened to the crew of the Scopuli . Holden , behind you ! I think it 's absorbing energy from the reactor . What do you really know about this kid , why she 's on Eros . I believe in her . KENZO : You 're going to Eros , aren 't you ? Let me help you find him . HOLDEN : I 'm looking for a friend who checked into a room here . Lionel Polanski . Hey ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( GROANING ) ( GRUNTS ) Shit just follow you around , don 't it , kid . Who the hell are you ? And what are you doing here ? Julie ? Everything going on out there , all this shit storm that we 're in , it 's all got to do with her , Julie Mao . You know that memory crypt that we took out of that stiff ? Yeah ? All right . Go 3-D . It had an unregistered flight path for a ship called the Anubis . The Anubis left Phoebe Research Station , and it was headed for Eros , okay ? Now , I 'm thinking , hmm , maybe something 's being transported on this ship . I 'm thinking Julie 's ship was sent out to intercept it . And then , suddenly ships start blowing up ... The Canterbury , the Donnager ... It 's got to be connected . What do you think is on this Anubis ? Something . Something worth spilling a lot of blood over . Ladar 's really flaky . WAN : Ah , scopes on this bucket suck . It 's nothing bigger than a light transport , nothing we can 't handle , gova gut . I 'm not worried . You gonna lock up from the adrenaline . I know how to fly . Easy . I 'm not trying to pet you the wrong way . I 'm trying to help . I 'm sorry . It 's just been a long time coming . A long fight to get here . If I had your kind of money , I 'd be sitting in a penthouse at the Shangri-La ... It 's my father 's money . I see . And that 's his weapon on that ship . Belters need to know what it is , so it can 't be used against us . Us ? You are a true believer . That she is ... You may not share our brittle bones , but you 're definitely one of us , Beltalowda . I saw you race once . Beautiful ship . The , uh ... Razorback . Hot ship . Hotter pilot . Prepare to intercept . Matching course and speed . ( BEEPS ) Boarding team check , komang gutegow ? WAN : ( OVER INTERCOM ) Ya , bosmang , grappling team , standing by . Soon as hooks are in , we drop charges , breach , subdue crew , grab the cargo then . Mowsh ando natet , beratnas , they 're scientists , not soldiers . They work for my father . They 'll fight . Where did that come from ? That 's the Anubis . That 's a gunship . ( RUMBLING ) Breaching pod , amidships ! Seal all compartments ! All hands ! We 're being boarded ! ( GUNFIRE ) ( MEN SHOUTING IN DISTANCE ) ( BANGING ) ( MAN GASPING ) ( GRUNTING ) Stinking Belters . Always trying to take what isn 't yours . ( GRUNTS ) How 'd you know we 'd be here ? How ? ( JULIE CRYING ) Hands off that one . She 's a complication . Put her in here until I figure out what to do with her . ( GASPING ) MALE VOICE : ( OVER INTERCOM ) Ma 'am , the distress beacon has been planted on the Scopuli . Canterbury should be picking it up soon . WOMAN : Let 's hope they take the bait . The sooner we get Earth and Mars at each other 's throats , the sooner we get their eyes off Eros . ( WOMAN COUGHING ) Does it feel hot in here to you ? No . Well , I 'm hot . Check climate control and make it cooler . ( WOMAN COUGHS ) Yes , ma 'am . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( BEEPING ) ( WEAKLY ) This is Lionel Polanski . I repeat , Lionel Polanski . ( SPEAKS NATIVE CREOLE ) The crew is dead . I 'm being held captive , I 'm alone . Please help me . Somebody come and get me . Please ! Somebody help ! Somebody help , please ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) MAN : ( ON INTERCOM ) All hands to action stations ! ( HEAVY BOOTS CRESCENDO ) MAN : ( INTERCOM ) Prepare to fire . ( BANGING ) ( BANGING ) JULIE : ( CRYING ) Please ! Get me out of here . ( THUMPING ) ( GASPS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( SCREAMING ) JULIE : This is Lionel Polanski . Mission has failed . Scopuli has been lost . I 'm aboard the Anubis , alone . There 's something in the reactor . It looks like it consumed everyone else . If it 's a bio-weapon , I 've never seen anything like it . I have to get off this ship . I 'll set up an O.P.A. locator beacon , and park it where no one else can find it . But I just have to leave . Eros station is within range of the Anubis shuttle . I 'll be there , waiting for you . ( WINGS FLUTTERING ) ( CHIRPING ) ( PHONE BEEPS ) Miller , you asshole . Long time . How they swinging ? So , listen , that ship you were looking for ... Anubis , whatever , it never showed up here . But the funny thing is , a short-range shuttle from that ship did . Anubis 1-A is still here on Eros , racking up dock fees . Kinda interested to know what 's in this for you , amigo . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) JULIE : I tried ... ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) I tried to keep a low profile , but it wasn 't as easy as I hoped . I had to get off the streets . ( BLOWS PUNCH ) ( GRUNTING ) ( COUGHING ) I left a trail of bread crumbs . A way for you to find me . And I waited ... ( COUGHING ) And I waited ... ( CONTINUES COUGHING ) Dawes ... You didn 't even answer . ( DAWES SPEAKING NATIVE CREOLE ON SCREEN ) JULIE : Why didn 't you come ? ( CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE CREOLE ) DAWES : You have every right to be angry . You should be angry . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( BUZZING ) ( LIGHTS CONTINUES BUZZING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( LIGHT BUZZING ) ( CRIES ) ( CONTINUES CRYING ) ( CONTINUES CRYING ) ( WHIRRING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( HAND TERMINAL SHATTERS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Please Mummy , don 't let him sell the Razorback . I want to see it again . ( WHISPERS WEAKLY ) See you ... ( WINGS FLUTTERING ) Proud of me ... ( WINGS CONTINUE FLUTTERING ) When I come home ... ( GASPING ) ( CHOKING ) MILLER : Julie ? HOLDEN : Ugh ! God , what 's that smell ? AMOS : Sweat , sick . HOLDEN : Nobody touch anything . Wait . Wait ! Oh . Oh , my God . HOLDEN : Don 't touch her . It could be contagious . ALEX : Come on , boys , we gotta go . Cavalry 's on its way . If he wants to stay , let him . There 's nothing you can do for her . And if you stay here , you 'll never find out who did this to her . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) ( GUN CLICKS ) Drop ' em ! Not happening . Easy . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING IN DISTANCE ) Jesus , Miller . What the hell you got yourself into ? Ain 't no way I can clean all this up . You got that right . We 're not asking you to do anything . We 're just gonna walk out of here real easy . We didn 't see each other . Look , you stay right where you are ! Miller , you tell me what the hell is going on here . She 's gone . What , the girl ? Room 22 . Don 't touch anything in there . Miller . Just lay low . Don 't leave this station till we talk . Let 's keep moving . HOLDEN : We need to find out what he knows . NAOMI : Don 't push him too hard right now . He 's having a tough time dealing with what we saw . The girl meant something to him . It was a shock finding her like that . AMOS : Miller , in here . Seal off this tenement . No one in or out without my say-so . Inspector Sematimba , CPM , what the hell are you doing here ? This is my crime scene . DRESDEN : CPM works for me . I 'm looking for this girl . AMOS : Doesn 't look like we were followed . NAOMI : That 's a relief . HOLDEN : Okay , I 'd say we 're all in a bit of trouble here , so why don 't we just figure out ... What were you doing following Julie ? HOLDEN : We didn 't know who we were looking for ... Who were those thugs back at the hotel ? HOLDEN : We don 't know . Any goddamn thing you do know ? All that stuff on her , we saw it before on the Anubis . The Anubis . What happened to her ? What happened to her ? HOLDEN : Settle down ! NAOMI : Back off ! Back off ! ALEX : Hey , easy there ! Amos ! For God 's sake , do something ! What we should be doing is leaving . The cops are gonna be all over us . We need to get back to the Roci and off this rock , now . He 's right . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING IN DISTANCE ) We shouldn 't separate . I 'm going to prep the ship for dust-off . You guys meet us there . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) We both followed Julie here . We both have part of the story . I want the truth as bad as you do . ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) Thank you for letting me come . Craig , I 'm devastated . I never would have thought he 's ... You weren 't here . I heard he was doing consulting work for the shipyards , which I took as a good sign . That make you feel better about betraying him ? There was no consulting work . I found out he was paying for those trips himself . He was ashamed of sitting around the house . So I played along . I let him keep his pride . It was the only thing he had left . He had you . He loved you more than anything . Frank always said , " It 's damn near impossible to stay properly mad at that brat . " I 'm not Frank . Would you mind if ... I need to say good bye . RUTGER : Should I be wearing a mask ? It 's not airborne . But if it 's wet , don 't touch it . Not unless you want incredible things to happen . She 's got more than enough in her . Tell the crew to prepare the injections . Give us a moment . DRESDEN : I 'm truly sorry to be the one to have to tell you this , but your daughter is dead . We still don 't know what exactly what happened on the Anubis , but it looks as though Julie was the lone survivor . Somehow , she managed to pilot the shuttle to Eros . The only thing that I can say to temper this terrible news is that I was able to obtain a viable sample of the protomolecule . The injections have been prepared . We 're ready for lockdown . The irradiation units are in place . We can still do what needs to be done . We may not get another chance . We 've come so far since that incredible revelation on Phoebe . Now we stand on the precipice . We can only learn by letting it learn . All you need to do now is to give the word . I 'll be waiting . ( DEVICE BEEPS ) ( SNIFFLING ) We got lucky . Proceed as planned . to figure out what that stuff was . We got off and nuked the ship behind us . What was Julie doing on the Anubis ? She was O.P.A. She found some new bio-weapon they were putting together on Phoebe . So did we . MILLER : She wanted to steal it . They couldn 't use it on Belters . And they used it on her . She was an Earther . She died for the Belt . ( RUMBLING ) ( CROWD SCREAMING ) HOLDEN : What the hell was that ? ( CROWD SCREAMING ) FEMALE VOICE : ( ON PA ) Attention . Eros Station has experienced a radiation hazard breach . For your own safety , please proceed ... You guys feel that ? HOLDEN : We sure did . FEMALE VOICE : ... nearest hard shelter in an orderly fashion . Son of a bitch . A ship just blew up in the Docks . The Roci ? ALEX : No , it wasn 't in that bay . That 's the good news . The bad news is , the ships are all locked down tight . ( INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ) We 're stuck here . Shit . ( INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT CONTINUES ) ( CROWD CLAMORING ) Hmm . The drives that match these serial numbers , what ships were they installed in ? ( BEEPS ) Include black ops . Locate the drives . Where are they right now ? ( BEEPS ) ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) FEMALE VOICE : ( ON PA ) For your own safety , please proceed immediately to the nearest hard shelter in an orderly fashion ... What are you looking at ? MILLER : When I see them cops , they 're CPM station security . They 're gangsters with badges . One team rounds ' em up , the other shakes ' em out . This was planned . They have assignments . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) They knew it was gonna happen . How could they know a ship was going to blow up in the docks ? ( INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PA ) They blew it up themselves . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) Hey ! Where the hell are you going ? Let him go ! Miller 's onto something . It 's all connected . The Cant , the girl ... It 's not your problem . And it 's not your fault . None of it is . Okay . But now I 'm making it my problem . Meet me back at the Roci , I 'll be a few hours , tops . We 're better when we stick together . If I 'm not back in three hours , leave . FEMALE VOICE : ( ON PA ) Attention . Eros Station has experienced a radiation hazard breach . For your own safety , please proceed immediately to the ... ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) FEMALE COP : Iodine supplement . Protects from radiation . Mandatory . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) No . No . No . You do not want to be around me right now , okay . This is gonna get ugly . I 'm getting used to ugly . Those two in the middle . The guys who took out the Donnager had body armor just like that . Not who I 'm aiming at . HOLDEN : Who is he ? One of the guys who do what they did to Julie . You need to go back to your friends . ( GRUNTS ) Dammit ! If he killed Julie , he killed my ship too . I need you alive ! ( GROANS ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) COP 1 : All right , sabakawala . COP 2 : Hey ! Break it on your feet ! COP 3 : Towalda supposed to go to shelter . Hey ! You go quiet and go now , else we throw you in there , ourselves . Help me up . My neck . Come on . ( GUNSHOT ) Here 's your problem , asshole . That just made me feel better . Turn around . My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Many of you know me , one way or another . My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson . ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) ( SNIFFS ) My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson . Many of you know me , one way or another . I come before you today not as a member of the Outer Planets Alliance , though I am proud to call myself one , but as citizen of the system . At this moment , the UNN Nathan Hale is headed for Tycho Station to arrest me because the UN believes I was involved in the attacks on the Donnager . That is not true . And I can prove it . This datacube was recovered from the wreckage of the Donnager , in the armor of a Martian marine . I 'm broadcasting the raw data with this message . Anyone can examine and authenticate it . It 's a detailed analysis of the ships that destroyed the Donnager . They were advanced stealth fighters . They didn 't come from the Belt . I didn 't build them . No Belter did , or could . Some people won 't believe that coming from me , because of who I am . I accept that . None of us can change the things we 've done . But we can all change what we do next . I 've seen battle . I 've taken many lives . I 've been the oppressor , and I know his mind . And now I hear the drumbeats of war . It 's the sound of lies and the love of power , and I cannot stand idly by . The Belt has served the Inner Planets for generations . Belters give , Earth and Mars take . Our language has changed , the things we care about have changed , even our bodies have changed . We look upon each other as different and we 've grown to hate each other for that . And now someone , somewhere , for some ungodly reason wants the whole , sad lot of us to fight and die . Well , this is not the Belt 's fight . This evidence proves beyond a doubt that the ships that destroyed the Donnager were built at the Bush Naval Shipyards . They were built by Earth . All right , who is that guy you 're guarding ? The scientist ? Yeah . 'Im was a scientist . ( GROANS ) Dresden . I heard them call him Dresden , that 's all I know . What 's this , huh ? It 's a Ceres Griega tatt . I used to run with them back there , so what ? So that makes you a gangster , you see . But you 're wearing a cop uniform . Why is that ? I went straight . ( GRUNTS ) I 'm gonna count to one . One . CPM offered a bunch of Griegas jobs here , a few months back . Sweet salary , fat bonus , no questions asked . And it wasn 't just us . All the Ceres crews , Golden Bough , Dos Arriagas , Sohiro 's ... They hired everybody . What for ? Tech stuff , mostly , it turned out . They had us hooking up cameras and science gear all over the station . HOLDEN : Why are you herding everybody into those shelters ? 'Cause that 's what they asked me to do today ! Their scrip spends . If these assholes want people in those shelters , we should let them out . Hey , you 're welcome to try . You said you were a cop . You a cop like him ? You 're going take me to the nearest shelter , and you 're gonna help me get in . CPM sees me with you , they shoot us both . Oh , he 's got a point . ( GUNSHOT ) ( GROANS ) HOLDEN : Jesus , Miller ! ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) Let 's get this poor officer some help . As far as I can tell , all the transit pod lines are shut down . Why would they do that ? All the ships are locked down , nobody 's going anywhere . First things first . The Roci . There 's gotta be other ways to get to the docks , so we need to find one . NAOMI : Wait ... Holden , we 're on the move ... Comms just went dark . ALEX : This ain 't an accident . It 's a plan . Please ! I 'm sorry I was late . The Transit Pods have been shut down ! The shelters are full . Please ! I just want to get to the shelters . Go home . COP 2 : Stay where you are ! Move along now , or we will use force . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) Are we just gonna stand here ? We can 't just charge in and start shooting . Pretty sure we can . Hey , keep your hands off these people . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? GUARD : Following orders . That 's Miller 's pal . Yeah , I didn 't get any orders anything like this . You stand down . I 've got rank here . Not today , you don 't . ( PANTING ) Sir , sir , we 're trying to get in ... ( CROWD SCREAMING ) ( GUNFIRE ) MILLER : We got a man down ! What the hell is this ? He needs medical attention . I can see that , but who the hell are you ? MILLER : Hey , some of your guys are taking fire down that connector shaft . You want to check it out . We 'll take care of him . WOMAN : You stay right there . Open the door . They said , once it 's shut , it stays shut . ( BLOWS PUNCH ) ( GROANS ) All right , all right . You 'll be all right . ( CROWD GROANING ) HOLDEN : Jesus . What ... ( MOANING ) ( BEEPING ) Get out ! Get out ! ( CONTINUES BEEPING ) What ... MILLER : What the hell was that ? We just got hit with a mega-dose of hard radiation . How bad ? We 're dead . FEMALE VOICE : ( OVER PA ) Attention . Eros station has experienced a radiation hazard breach ...

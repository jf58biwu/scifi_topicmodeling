My lord ! Can 't he atleast draw it even if I move a lil ' bit ? It 's almost finished . Please bear with us a while longer . It 'll still be a portrait worthy of the drawing , right ? HEY ! That isn 't the face of our lord ! You have to imagine the shape of the horseradish while you 're painting his face ! And the nose ! It 's the shape of a dumpling ! And the eyes ! Shouldn 't it be drawn slightly circular like that of a dead fish ? ! Why are you guys making a joke of someone 's face in front of you ? ! No , we are not . Goodness ! Can 't you even appropriately draw it with more style ? ! You goatee bearded monk ! Constraint yourself ! No . Please wait a moment . The way ... this is drawn doesn 't sound bad at all . No way ! Like seriously ? ! Lemme see it ! WHO IS THIS ? ! THIS IS JUST AN OLD MAN ! WHAT PART OF HIM DESCRIBES ME ? Why don 't you tell me then , Tsune-chan ? What now ? Tsune-chan ? What ? GIOVANNI ! As the lord said himself ! IT 'S ABSOLUTELY NOT HIM ! His Majesty 's beard is too long ! Wouldn 't it be that you drew this one ? ! You wanna go at me ? ! What are you arguing about ? Would you look at this , Kichou ! It doesn 't resemble me at all , right ? ! Fool ... They did such a great work to beautify this painting , didn 't they ? Okay , I 'm done . My lord ! The lobby is now ready ! They will be serving the lun-- - SHUTTAAAP ! THIS ISN 'T THE TIME FOR THAT ! DO YOU EVEN KNOW THE MAN IN THIS PICTURE ? ! HAAA ? ! It is everyone 's doing that we are able to open Kyoto in this very great day ! Then , for reaching Azuchi ... LET 'S TOAST ! CHEERS ! HEEEYYY ! LORD NOBUNAGA ! I AM OVERJOYED ! WITH THE ODA FAMILY HAVING SUCH A SMALL REIGN ... EVENTUALLY , THE FAMILY 'S FAME HAS SPREAD BROADLY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ! I AM ABSOLUTELY PROUD OF THIS ODA NOBUNAGA 'S DYNASTY ! Such a great pretender ! Sorry to disturb you while you 're crying but Japan isn 't that broad at all . So you 're saying this place isn 't that broad ? Just have a look at this . This is the planet where we all live in ! And then .. this here ! This here is Japan . So small . So , we really live in such an independent location like that ? That 's right . Nothing less from you , my lord ! You are knowledgeable ! He always studies ! My lord ! You 're amazing ! What nonsense are you spouting ? How can people live in such a narrow place such as that ? ! I may not know the small details , but are you aware of the world 's rotation ? You see , our planet revolves around the sun ... We go all around the Lord Sun ? ! How unbelievable that is ! It 's the truth ! Some great scientists discovered it ! One with the name of Copenhagen ! Saying ridiculous things again ! Telling me that I 'm stupid all the time ... You 'll find out later that you 're the fool ! Uhh ... no , no ! Well ... Just as always ! You share such a good relationship with each other , right ? Hey .. ! Nobunaga . Long time , no see , Matsunaga ! Yeah , right . But who would have thought ? A high school student such as yourself actually came through a time slip and has been able to build such a great city like this as Nobunaga Oda , huh ? I admire you . Totally envy you ! It 's scary being suddenly praised by you . Why are you crying ? This kind of situation is actually my weak spot ! What do you mean ? When it 's about the life of a man ... ! ... who is doing his best for his family and important people-- - stuffs like that ! Wait ... I don 't get you at all . I know you knew about your life expectancy that 's why you built this for your people , right ? For your wife and your followers ! Life expectancy ? What do you mean ? After all ... ! You 're going to die soon , aren 't you ? ! Die ? Why will I die ? Oh ? You haven 't read the Japanese history textbook thoroughly , have you ? Textook ? This one . Hey , this is ... ! Honnoji Coup and Death : Honnoji Incident YEAR 1582 ( 10 years of residence ) NOBUNAGA 'S DEATH Right ? Isn 't it written there ? " You will die soon . " NOBUNAGA 'S DEATH Nobunaga 's death in year 1582 ( 10 years of residence ) was caused under the hands of Akechi Mitsuhide . Akechi Mitsuhide lost against Hashiba Hideyoshi and was then captured by him and killed . Hideyoshi became heir to Nobunaga 's legacy and became the successor to the Nobunaga region . No way . NOBUNAGA 'S DEATH I 'm ... going to die ? Subtitles by FURRITSUBS No way ! There 's no way I 'm believing that crap . The event that I came here , I 'm sure that much have changed history ! It hasn 't changed at all . The war that happened at Okehazama , Jouraku , Kanegasaki , and with the Azai-Asakura alliance ... All the things you 've done to this point are all written down exactly in this textbook . All of the things you consciously have done were the exact same things written in History . It is true . Nothing has changed in history . That means ... The fated death that awaits you ... hasn 't change a single bit . That 's why you will die soon . Your time limit may be today ... may be tomorrow too but you will die during this very year . I 'm sure of that . I see . I can 't have that . Just when I have taken reign . I will be able to build peace in the world soon ... Dying before I achieve that ... I CAN 'T LET THAT HAPPEN ! No matter how you defy history fate cannot be changed . Nobunaga ... You are , without doubt , destined to die . The death of Takenaka Hanbei that has been hidden for too long has been publicized today . I see . " I didn 't stop him . " Who would have known that Hanbei and your brother were discreetly cooperating with each other without us knowing ... Lord Nobunaga ... It 's about time you start taking back what belongs to you . It is an undeniable fact that without that person , the Oda family wouldn 't have grown this far . However ... the one who rightfully has inherited the Oda blood is you ! Even lady Kichou and Tsuneoki too ... ! Everyone knows your real identity ... .. but they decided to follow the impostor Nobunaga ! I ask of you ... We must find a way to dispos-- - I know . But still ... I didn 't know that you 're acting could be executed that well ! You even pretended to cry some tears , you vixen ! Hey ... You discussed it with him , didn 'tcha ? I didn 't hear about that . For only just a trivial 150,000 stones of honorary degree ... Trivial ? What are you referring to ? ! Now , please calm down ! The value of a soldier is not only deserving through high stones ... Samurai sword is the essence of the soul ! The way of the sword , huh ? I heard that you were sent to host a tea ceremony considering my request to expand the area ... You want to rob the chance from me , huh ? ! You 'd so as much just to succeed , you dog ! DOG ? WHO YOU 'RE CALLING A DOG ? ! Are you pissed off the fact that I got a higher position than you did ? DON 'T YOU GO FLATTERING YOURSELF WITH SUCH VULGARITY ! I 'M NOT A LOUDMOUTH UNLIKE YOU ! I ONLY HAVE 500,000 , YOU DOG SCUM ! GET A GRIP OF YOURSELVES ! AREN 'T YOU ALL ASHAMED WITH YOUR DEPLORABLE SELVES ? ! It 's a rare opportunity that we get to be together like this ... Come , let us rejo-- - Why are you lecturing us with such a superior attitude ? ! Today is the day we determine the one among us who are worthy with the position in this Oda Family ! ON CUE ! JUST AS I DESIRED ! Hey . Hashiba Hideyoshi ! You ... Don 't you go assuming that you can just easily take over the empire . What are you talking about ? For me as a civilian , the empire is far away from my reach . Is that really the case ? You are , without doubt , destined to die . I can 't have that ... I will be able to build peace in the world soon ... Dying before I achieve that ... What the heck ? My lord ! The Ishiyama Honganji are revolting ! Rebelling ? The Honganji announced a congregation to rise up ... To top that off , Uesugi Kenshin is also providing his cooperation for the issue . That bastard Honganji ! And why the heck is Uesugi cooperating too ? ! We should go over to Uesugi 's place . The Oda 's main force is far more superior ! Not only that ... The Chugoku region agreed with Honganji that they will rebel with them after Uesugi cooperates too . What did you say ? ! My lord . I know . With the Honganji and Uesugi working together ... I am definitely sure the enemy will attack us from over here . And if the Chugoku region is revolting with them too ... They will attack us from the east and west lines and surely we will be defeated . And then ... This means that the Oda family will perish . If we lose ... We will be parted away from peace . So no matter what , we cannot afford to lose at all cost . In order to build a world without war ... With that said ... Allow me , Shibata Katsuie from the Shibata force to crusade all over to Honganji ! No , my lord ! Allow me , Nagahide Niwa from the Maeda family ! Allow me , Sasa Narimasa to host that ! MY LORD ! MY LORD ! MY LORD ! QUIET DOWN ! Now isn 't the time to grab exploitation ! As the lord himself says ... Over taking the exploitation for yourself , we should prioritize on how to overcome this conflict . Bastard . Don 't you personally just want to show off the Honganji crusade to yourself ? We won 't allow you to monopolize the spot ! HE 'S RIGHT ! However , as the adviser , I think Mitsuhide is a suitable prospective to crusade over to Honganji . SARU ! What are your motives ? ! I agree . I want you to be responsible for Micchi as you go over to Honganji . Understood . And then , Nagayoshi and Matsunaga should dispatch for reinforcements . Shibata and Toshiie is responsible for Uesugi . Understood . Niwa and Narimasa is responsible for the east government . Understood . Saru , you go west against Maori . Leave it to me . Before Honganji and Uesugi meets for the combat we must win , no matter what ! I 'm counting on you , guys . UNDERSTOOD ! The time has come . What for ? Take advantage of this opportunity to kill the impostor . Following the expeditions tomorrow , Azuchi will become a weak ground . The troops that will stay in the city is only a maximum of three thousand . The level of the defense forces you and I have is enough to suppress them . However ... I am going to charge over to Honganji . After the mock attack , you will return to Azuchi with your troops and kill him . With that ... This palace will be yours . Are you hesitating to finish off the impostor ? You must throw away your softheartedness . As initially as it is . You truly are the home of the Oda family lord Nobunaga . Nobunaga ... You , after all ... are not meant to rule at all . You 've done enough . PULL BACK ! You fiend ... Oda Nobunaga ! Hurry up ! Hurry ! Wait ! Oh , my ... What 's wrong ? Why aren 't you wearing a ring , sister ? I didn 't have a ring before . Did elder brother not give you one ? I think your elder brother ... isn 't fond of weddings , perhaps ? Elder brother didn 't organize a wedding for you ? ! So to speak ... Elder sister ... don 't you want one ? That 's ... Just a teeny tiny little bit ... Then , I 'll go and ask him to ! No ! It 's not as if I do want him to give me one ... Wedding ? By wedding , you mean a ceremonial marriage ? Yes . You haven 't done it with elder sister , right ? Well .. Then , you must surely do so ! Right , sister ? It 's not that I desire so much to have a wedding , though ... So you say ... But deep in your heart , you want elder brother to do the wedding with you . I hope you will make her desire come true okay , elder brother ? You are , without doubt , destined to die . Elder brother ... ? A war is about to break out . This isn 't the time for that . You didn 't have to say in such a manner ! Even so , elder brother ... ! Ichi , it 's okay ! You 've done enough . Excuse me for the bother . Come , let 's go . FRONT ! My lord . The warriors have fled off the province . The enemy crusade has now begun . The war has started . Namo Amitabha ... Namo Amitabha ... Namo Amitabha ... ISHIYAMA HONGANJI Zen Master ! The Oda army has reached the Tennoji 's stronghold ! I see . TENNOJI Lord Mitsuhide ! Ishiyama Honganji has assembled about fifty thousand troops on his side ! You mean fifty thousand people ? The number they have ... to be honest , they have more on their side . The situation is not good . I have a suggestion . We should divide the troops in three and surround our enemies . Surround ? Yes . We should build a new fortress both in the north and east . Together with Tennoji and Ishiyama Honganji being surrounded together so they cannot move anymore . In order to allow the enemy to a surprising shortage the battle will maintain in a deadlock . After the mock attack you will return to Azuchi with your troops and kill him . With that . this palace will be yours . Hey , fool . You called for me ? I want you to go to the Ieyasu 's place at Mikawa for the meanwhile . What do you mean ? Since I don 't know what will happen ... Just in case , I want you to be at a safe location . Why are you suddenly saying that to me ? So far there has been a lot of battles but I never left this town for that . Even if that 's the case ... I don 't intend to leave this palace . Just go over to Mikawa , already . I won 't . Just go . If I say I won 't , I won 't . I SAID JUST GO ALREADY ! Sorry . Then , give me an explanation . Why would I have to flee away from here ? What now ? Why are you keeping silence ? If you won 't tell me the reason I will stay here in this palace . I 'm gonna die . I 'm going to die soon . Die ? You did well surrounding Honganji . If the war is not moving in this situation even if they come here , they won 't realize it . For that to be possible you strived to maintain a stalemate mood for the war . Everything is for the sake of killing Saburo . You 're talking nonsense again ! Are you trying to play with me again ? I 'm not . Nevertheless , casually mentioning your death as if it 's a small matter ! You really are such an unmindful man ! I came from the future . I came from the future . Future ? I came through here from 500 years in the future . This is called a time slip , through ... From a very distant era ... Suddenly , one day I arrived here . Well , umm ... These things here ! All of these are things from the future ! For example . This here , is a smart phone . You can call someone who 's far away ... You can also take pictures and record a video in it . Since I came on a time slip ... That 's why I know the death of Nobunaga . You , after all ... are not meant to rule at all . You truly are the home of the Oda family ... Lord Nobunaga . I 'm going to take it back my " Oda Nobunaga " place . We 're going back to Azuchi . The moment has arrived . As long as it makes sense that we are crusading against the rebel Akechi ... I can rule over the nation . It could be after a year ... Maybe after six months ... And possibly through this war . I do feel sorry about the wedding ... But ... since I 'm going to die , doing that would be ... I 'm sure it 'll only make you sad . That 's why ... the only thing I can do is to keep you away from danger . Even if you 're away from me , I 'm sure you 'll be safe ! DON 'T PLAY WITH ME ! You 're going to die ? As if I would believe such a thing ! Stop being stupid , you fool ! It 's the truth ! SHUT UP ! I don 't want to hear your silly nonsense ! Kichou ... Wait ... Kichou ... I SAID WAIT ! Tsune-chan ... Lord Mitsuhide ! Bad news ! My lord ! Milord Mitsuhide has ... ! Lord Mitsuhide ! WHAT 'S WRONG ? ! Where were you ? ! Please give directions as soon as possible ! Step aside ! What happened ? This wasn 't supposed to happen . I am very grateful for giving us information about their maneuver plans . Lord Matsunaga . The fact that General Mitsuhide went farther away from his spot I thought it was a great opportunity . But ... why do you stand on our side ? I can 't allow Nobunaga to take rule over this nation . The one who gets to rule is me ! I bring forth news ! The Tennoji enemy stronghold has about eighteen thousand people ! Eighteen thousand ? ! If they are surrounded by so many soldiers ... . ... Akechi 's military support won 't last for two days ! Akechi has been surrounded ? Yes . Hideyoshi ... If this continues , Akechi will ... ! My lord ! We must rescue Milord Mitsuhide ! We only have three thousand soldiers here ! It 's a counter-crusade . Our number is too poor ! Calm down ! I 'm sure there 's a way for this ! Then ... ! We should hold a national minister to call fo-- - It 's impossible . Calling them now will be far too late . So , will you stand so much as for abandoning Mitsuhide in the battle field ? ! But , the way we are now , we have no chance of winning . Exactly . Going means as much as dying . My lord ! I know . But , I will go and save Micchi . My lord ... Everyone ! We are now off for Tennoji ! Side by side , we will surely rescue Akechi Mitsuhide ! Hear me ? ! YES ! Lord Mitsuhide ! The Moriguchikawa and Moriguchimori has been ruined altogether ! We cannot abide by the northern gate for too long ! This is as far as I go , huh ? I HAVE NEWS ! Lord Nobunaga sent reinforcements of three thousand people ! Hirano has crossed the river forward to reach us here in the camp ! What ? ! Does lord Nobunaga want to die ? ! With only three thousand people ? ! How reckless of him . Cut off ... NOBUNAGA 'S HEAD ! Artillery forces , forward ! HERE WE GO ! YES ! CHARGE ! DO NOT FALTER ! AIM FOR NOBUNAGA ! TAKE HIS LIFE ! TSUNE-CHAN ! My lord ! WE 'RE TAKING THEM DOWN ! NEWS ! The Azuchi reinforcement soldiers headed to this camp has clashed with Honganji ! The one pioneering them is ... His majesty , lord Nobunaga Oda ! He personally pioneered them ? ! Yes ! Saburo ... WE WILL FIGHT WITH THEM TOGETHER ! UNDERSTOOD ! OPEN THE GATES ! MEN ! AKECHI HAS COME ! MY LORD ! My lord ! My lord ! My lord ! WE CAN KILL NOBUNAGA RIGHT NOW ! WE WON 'T LET YOU ESCAPE ! I 'm going to die soon . Maybe , a year later ... Maybe , after six months ... And possibly through this war . My lord ! NOBUNAGAAAAA ! You are , without doubt , destined to die . DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO THAT MAN IS BEFORE YOU ? ! HE IS THE MAN SUBJECT TO RULE OVER THIS NATION ... ODA NOBUNAGA ! His majesty 's life with us as his followers have vowed to protect him and his life ! Everyone ... Let us assist .. ... his majesty ! We 're going . Why ... Why did you come and save me ? ! It 's plain sight obvious ! Leaving you all by yourself and be victorious would be very problematic ! We also want our share of merit . The end shot will delay our promotions ! Right ! For appeal purposes ! Right , right ! We 're not losing ! We don 't lose in exploitations ! Looks like I 'm the number one follower of the Oda family ! I didn 't have a clue as to where exactly will the sunset fall to . I have never considered thinking about those kinds of stuffs . If I didn 't meet you ... I 'm sure that I wouldn 't appreciate this feeling now as I look at the sunset today . You have taught me a lot , my lord . All the irrational lessons ... Even the strangest things ... And also ... That one day , there will be a world without war . Please , my lord . Allow us to see too , the world that you are looking at . I 'm sure , one day ... I will create a peaceful world and live in it . I think this is the reason why I became Nobunaga , or something . His majesty is back ! I 'm home , Kichou ! You 're home late , fool ! I 'm sorry for making you worry . Worry ? It 's not like there 's something to worry for . I see . Hey , Kichou ... Let 's do it ... a wedding ceremony . I 'm not gonna die . I won 't ever think of dying again . I won 't give up on life . I will fight against destiny . So ... I want you to marry me . Fool ... From now on , I will always be with you , Kichou . I 'm not gonna die ahead of you . That 's why ... We will become wrinkled and old people together . Kichou ... Please live together with me . No ... I don 't wanna become a wrinkled old woman . I 'm fine with being wrinkled . If you can 't even live long until you get wrinkled ... I 'll make you have them then , okay ? I promise you . Well then I don 't mind spending my life with you . How did our action leak to the enemy ? I do not know . They only attacked the external portion of the camp . The external portion got attacked ? You ... Don 't you go assuming that you can just easily take over the empire . Matsunaga ... Hideyoshi ... Let 's ... Give up already . Have you once heard about the first combat situation I was involved in ? At that point , I had to make my victory even more brilliant . The enemy general accidentally escaped to that village so we burned it down . Set fire ! But ... lord Nobunaga ! Silence ! Burn everything now ! Nobunaga ... You , after all ... are not meant to rule at all . My father saw through me . Without a reason ... I set the village on fire through this sinking shallow heart of mine . Without a reason ... Without a reason , you say ? Hideyoshi , that bastard . He 's excessively showing off his siege . Lord Matsunaga ! Hashiba Hideyoshi has come in to see you . Hideyoshi ? What is that ? If it 's a souvenir , I don 't need it . What is this about ? You bastard , Matsunaga . Do you know what you did ? From whom did you hear what ? Answer me . Oh , I know everything . You 're gonna kill , right ? That bastard , Mitsuhide . Who exactly are you ? Just some plain old yakuza . That hurt , asshole ! However , I ... Even if I accumulate up to 700,000 stones and become a great daimyo ... I 'm still far away from the real great ones . As to how can we make a better nation ... As to how can we get the people to enjoy a better life ... I 'm always thinking about things like this ... And now every day , I can only eat tempura all the time . I think tempura is more than enough , though . Why the heck is it so delicious ? ! So aside from politics , the only thing you can think off is tempura , huh ? Oh ! And women too , huh ? THAT 'S A GIVEN ! That part of you hasn 't changed at all . Hey , stop it ~ ~ ~ stop that ! Hey , lord Nobunaga ! Lord Nobunaga ... By the way ... You said one time to let me have lady Kichou under my care . How should I do so ? Ieyasu , you are someone who left a big legacy to people . I thought that I could maybe rely on to you for something . This is enough . Well then .. I , Tokugawa Ieyasu will dream together with you for a broader nation ! For the better of Mikawa ... And also for the happiness of the people around us . Let 's realize this dream together . For the happiness of the people around us , huh ? And that important person for you ... is lady Kichou , right ? Okay . Pour me some . Hey ... Actually ... Though it 's a bit late now ... I want to give Kichou a wedding ceremony . W-Wedding ? It such a very fantastic event ! It is the conclusion of a pair as the husband comes back as they start living their lives together . I see ... It makes you remember the good ol ' times , huh ? I 'm sure lady Kichou will be very delighted ! So ... Where do you plan to have the wedding ? Well , let 's see ... At Kyoto ... Honnoji ! Oh , that 's good . I have to do something there so I 'll go ahead . Well then , I 'm counting on all of you . YES ! This is really something to celebrate ! Lets hold a grand wedding ceremony ! It 's fine , it 's fine . It 's this late already so I plan to do it alone with her . Micchi ? You once told us ... the story of the sun . The earth that we all line in revolves around the sun . But no one believed my story , though . You are a man just like the sun . Everyone around you ... You light up everyone and everything around you . The followers ... the retainers ... Kichou , too . That 's an exaggeration ... If you are then sun ... I am the current floating night sky moon . There is a limit to the level of light I can display . But still ... I don 't get the complicated stuffs ... If there is no moon , the earth can 't live off , you know ? Although the sun is needed ... If there is no moon in this world , there is no way the sun can revolve well . What was it again ? Or something like a rotation or some sort . That 's why , both are necessary . This world needs both of those . Including me and you too , Micchi . Well then , Tsune-chan . I leave things to you . Please let me handle it . However ... Since this journey is for lady Kichou I 'm sure she 'll be happy from her heart . But , I 'm feeling quite embarrassed to wear the white kimono , though . I don 't think so . Because , my lord ... those things are needed for you to live strong . Oh , right ! There 's one more favor I want to ask you , Tsune-chan . A favor ? Goodness ... He is one clumsy person . I came from the future . Since I came from a time slip ... I know the death of Nobunaga . Lady Kichou . Is something wrong ? His majesty has now departed . Right now , huh ? What is that ? One of the belongings of the foolish . My lord 's ? I think I have seen the same thing once before too . I remember ! It was from the Kappa we caught at Osaka ! He also had the same thing . Kappa ? That creature ... He was repeatedly talking nonsense . He says that he came from a time slip . I must hurry and go . Where are you going , lady Kichou ? I 'm on my way to Osaka . To Osaka ? What did you come to talk for ? Let 's kill that man at Honnoji . He only has a few soldiers around him . If we suddenly launch an attack , it 'll be difficult for them to fend us off . I can never go back to my position as Nobunaga . Right now , for once I want to support him as Akechi . What are you misunderstanding ? I 'm not asking for your opinion . What did you say ? If you refuse , then I will kill Kichou . The guards around Kichou as she 's off to Osaka are all my retainers . You should know what that implies . YOU FIEND ! Cut me if you shall . But Kichou is going to die . Not only that ... If you won 't kill the impostor I will kill him by my own hands . I will kill the impostor and then the followers . Next is your younger sister . Everyone . I will kill them all . Just as when you killed all the people in my village . You ... You only have but one path to follow . Murder the impostor at Honnōji ... That 's all . Is this the one that you call " Kappa " ? Are these his items ? Yes . You .. Yes ? What is your name ? My name is William Adams . Where did you come from ? From Essaouira beach ... I came on a time-slip from the future . Time ... slip ? Do you know ... about Oda Nobunaga ? I love the history of Japan ... ! I definitely know about Nobunaga . Then , I shall ask you . Nobunaga in what event will Nobunaga die ? He will get killed . By who ? ! Akechi ... Akechi Mitsuhide . When ? ! Where ? ! When was that ? ... I already forgot ! But , I do know the place where ! Honnoji ! Fool ... ! HONNOJI MY LORD ! There is bad news ! What ? Something happened , Ranmaru ? After lady Kichou went to Osaka , she is on her way over here ... So , her arrival may be too late . Geez ... What the heck is that Kichou doing ? Wait . Milord Mitsuhide ... Are we not going to the shrine ? We are now going to a banquet . A banquet ? Why are we going there ? There 's something I want to take back . Oda Nobunaga 's head ... The Nobunaga right now ... is my shadow avatar ! I am ... Oda Nobunaga ! Akechi 's army is now marching off to Honnoji ! Right now ... we will join the crusade to fight of the rebels that is Mitsuhide ! THE ENEMY IS AT HONNOJI ! YES ! Are we there yet ? Are we not at Honnoji yet ? We will arrive soon ! What 's wrong ? Who are you people ? ! Attack ! MY LORD ! Enemy attacks are coming ! Who is the enemy ? One who owns a Bellflower family coat of arms ... Akechi Mitsuhide has rebelled against us ! Micchi ... ATTACK ! SET THE FIRE AFLAME ! SHOOT ! Why ... ? Lord Nobunaga ! My lord ! Hurry and escape the temple ! HURRY ! My lord ? I HAVE NEWS TO REPORT ! Damn it ... DAMN IT ALL ! As if I will die here ... I won 't allow to die off here ! It 's about time . ATTACK ! Micchi ... Why are you doing this ? WHY ? ! Hideyoshi is after your life . Saru-kun is ... ? As Hideyoshi instructed , I am here to kill you . If I refused , he will kill everyone and Kichou too . Kichou ... ? Is Kichou alright ? ! Don 't worry ... A report just came in that my followers are protecting her away from the enemy . Kichou is at a safe place now . CHARGE ! Saburo ... I admittedly envy you . As Oda Nobunaga ... The followers .. the retainers Kichou-- - they all love you . What the heck is that ? You were the one who told me to swap places with you as Nobunaga ! I adored the sun . Sun ? ... Shining over everyone ... Such a strong unfaltering sunlight ... My body has always been weak ever since I was a child . I wasn 't recognized by my father , and I was hated by my brother . My followers ... my wife too . Everyone left my side . Nevertheless , I ... Inside this darkness where I have no one ... I prayed to become the sun . I wanted to become someone like you . Being like you who resembles the sun ... But I ... wasn 't meant to belong there . I should not become the sun ... I 'm sure I was meant to entrust Nobunaga to you . That is the calling given to me . You must run away and live ! As Nobunaga , you have completed God 's will . God 's will ? Until you complete it you won 't ever die . I can 't escape by myself ! Come with me ! I can 't . Why ? ! You have to go ... BUT .. ! JUST GO ! NOBUNAGA ! We must arrest the rebel Mitsuhide Akechi ! HEAR ME ? ! That day ... When I met you under that tree by the road ... Everything I 've been through has been difficult ... I 've had a lot of episodes of sufferings ... However ... But still , I ... I 'm happy I became Nobunaga ... Thank you ... Micchi . Well then be off . Farewell ... Nobunaga ... That day was scorching hot , too . Burning everything into ashes ... The houses ... The people and everything else . Because you set the fire aflame ... Hideyoshi ... With this life of mine at stake will it put everything to an end ? I ask you ! STOP SCREWING WITH ME ! Will it end it all ? There 's no way one petty life will be able to attain for everything ! That impostor ... I will kill him instead ! Together with Kichou ... the followers ... and your sister ! I will murder them all without leaving one life ! The one who will rule and own this palace will be me . You cannot ! You cannot ! You cannot ! You cannot ! You cannot kill him ! That man is someone needed by this country ! I implore you ! Please take my life ! That doesn 't matter to me . I just want you to desperately protect your life as I take it away from you . That day ... You took everything away from me . Listen , Nobunaga ... To offer your life is futile . Your death is meaningless . My vengeance begins now . Without a reason ... I set the village on fire . KILL THEM ... ! DENJIRO ! RUN AWAY ! You fiend Oda Nobunaga ! Thank you Micchi . Hideyoshi ! Listen closely , people !

NOBUNAGA 'S DEATH Nobunaga 's death in year 1582 ( 10 years of residence ) was caused under the hands of Akechi Mitsuhide . Akechi Mitsuhide lost against Hashiba Hideyoshi and was then captured by him and killed . Hideyoshi became heir to Nobunaga 's legacy and became the successor to the Nobunaga region . Akechi Mitsuhide lost against Hashiba Hideyoshi KILLED If so ... we must return to Azuchi and explain the situation to them ! You can 't . We are the military force of Oda and we didn 't believe in Hideyoshi 's words . And outside this place are swarming with military force from Hashiba . Escaping right now from here would be ... Tomorrow morning , we will have the final battle against the Hashiba Army . Lord Nobunaga ... you must stay here and hide . Lord Tsuneoki ! Akechi has been caught by the retainers ! What did you say ? ! Something wrong , fool ? It hasn 't changed . Nothing ever changed in history . Akechi will lose . And then , I will be captured by Saru and get killed .

Tomorrow morning , we will have the final battle against the Hashiba Army . Nothing changed in history . Akechi will lose . And then I will be captured by Saru and get killed . You must run away and then live ! As Nobunaga , you have completed God 's will . I want to make a peaceful world and live in it . I think that 's the reason I became Nobunaga . As Nobunaga , huh ? God 's will . FOOL ! Why ... ? Why must you still go ... ? History did not change , right ? Why ? ! Kichou ... We quarreled a lot , right ? With has lots of laughter together ... We had a lot of dates too , right ? The times I spent with you ... were all exciting and happy ! That 's why , I will not forget . I will never forget . Why would you say these words ? Didn 't you say we will live together ? Didn 't you promise me ? ! I 'm sorry . But ... I have to go . Even if history can 't be changed ... These feelings I hold will definitely be connected to the future . Kichou ... I understand . Be off ... fool . If your mind has decided I can only send you off . That is ... My responsibility as your wife . I 'm happy I met you in this era , Kichou . I 'm glad . Goodness ... You rant excessively , fool . Somehow something like this happened once before , right ?

His Majesty asked me to give this to you . I have one favor I want to ask you , Tsune-chan . I want you to give Kichou a ring from me . His Majesty has told me so ... That as long as you have this ring you two are husband and wife for a lifetime . This ring is a proof . Even if you two are apart because of the war ... Even if he is not by your side he hopes that you will look at the ring and remember . That 's why , his majesty ... He will always be with you . You fool ... Attack ! I 'm happy I met you in this era , Kichou . Why did you kill Micchi ? WHY ? ! He took everything away from me . He burnt the village I was born he killed my brother . This is my revenge . Revenge is pointless ! Hating ... will only bring forth hatred . Saru-kun ... were you happy when you killed Micchi ? Shut up . Revenge will only make you empty ! Shut up . So , stop this already . Let 's make a world ... where no one gets hurt and suffer ! Just like you , Saru ... You lost the people you cherish ... That kind of living in a world where no one has to get hurt ... And inside that world you speak of ... You will meet your death here . If that 's what my end is I leave everything to you , Saru-kun . Not only to you ... I want everyone to create it altogether ... This will I have as I existed in this era with everyone ... This feeling I hold ... I want to entrust it to all of you . Even if I die ... I hope you can connect it to the future .

 Previously on Hunters ... You 're not suicidal , Flynn . You 're angry . The Hunters did something to you . ( Flynn ) Why didn 't you tell me the truth ? Why did the Hunters target me ? Why ? Because you left when you should have died . So who cares ? ( Jackson ) Emme does . You 're all she has now . And until you find out what really happened , it will kill you . But your father , we have him . - Finnerman did this to you ? - A soldier brought me here . - Polynesian looking , had an accent . - This guy ? We 've reunited you with your daughter . I only ask that you translate Hunter recordings that we 've intercepted . I think Hunters are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack . And Musa has been working with Viktor Karp , and arms dealer who has access to long range missiles . ( Ted ) Your mother tried to kill me . She 's Musa 's right hand . As long as I 'm alive , you 're in danger . ( groans ) Protect the innocent ones . Please , someone help us ! ( rap music playing ) ( man ) Alba , Biel , or Jones ? Easy , Jessica Jones all the way . - Over this ? - You 're insane , Brecke . - It 's hypothetical , man . - So hypothetically , he 'd bang a comic book chick instead of her . ( Clinton impersonation ) I did not have sexual relations - with that cartoon . - Shouldn 't you be scouting ? Oh , I 'm scouting all right . You 're a piece of work , Carroll . Says the guy with papercuts on his dick . - ( all laughing ) - All right . All right , all right . Hold up . Keegan , turn that shit down . ( music volumes lowers ) ( Flynn ) We got an encampment . 10 : 00 . - What the hell is Tali doing out here ? - ( Flynn ) Waiting to throw us a party in a freaking circus tent ? We got a convoy 15K behind us . We should check it out , clear it . We 're out of I.R. range . We 'll need to move in closer . Two ways through . The canyon 's shorter . It 's a blind approach . Blind for them , too . Your call , scout , what 's it 's gonna be ? ( engine starts ) Canyon . ( Flynn ) Damn it ! That 's not good . Back it up ! Back it up ! Outlaw 1 , Outlaw 1 , we got a roadblock . - Bob , get us out of here . - Roger that . - ( gunshots ) - ( cries out ) - Yates is hit ! - Taking fire ! ( cries out ) - They 're blocking our way out ! - Get out ! Go , go , go ! ( machinegun fire ) Come on ! Let 's move , move , move , now ! Come on , move , move ! Go ! Go , go , go , go , go ! He 's hit ! Fall back ! Brecke , no ! ( cries out ) - My leg 's hit ! - Brecke , up ! Come on , soldier ! ( creature clicking ) ( groans ) Outlaw one ! I 'm with Brecke , Keegan , and Yates ! We 're surrounded ! Say again , we 're surrounded ! ( creature clicking ) We keep shooting , but they 're not going down ! ♪ ♪ ♪ I 'm calling for you ♪ ♪ You are why I 'm still breathing ♪ ♪ For you ♪ ♪ ( creature clicking ) ( man screaming ) ( Jackson ) Some Hunter victims like Jules Calloway have the same scar on the forearm that you have . Except I 'm still here and they 're not . Yeah , there 's got to be some reason you survived . Brecke may know why . I 've got a D.O.D. bird that 'll fly you to Alabama . From there , you take a car to Brecke 's home . See if his recollection of the attack on your unit is any better than yours . Will do . And sir , tell Agent Regan I 'm sorry for her loss . Yeah . - ( machine gunfire ) - Ow , my leg ! You 're good . You 're gonna be okay . I 'm out ! They 've got snipers on both ends of the canyon . - There 's no way out . - Screw that . I got us in here , I 'm gonna get us out ! Shit ! I 'm out , too . ( creature clicking ) ( growling ) There was this one time , I was ten , I was molting . It used to freak me out . Layers of myself just falling off . And my dad did this really corny thing . He showed me a caterpillar in our backyard molting out of its cocoon . And he said , " Don 't hate what you are . " " Be patient . Someday , we 'll all have wings . " Finnerman said no , didn 't she ? Your request was denied . He 'll be autopsied like the others . - Regan ... Allison ... - I will fucking kill her . My father killed himself because of that bitch . You realize that ? ( sighs ) ( Jackson ) You need to take some time off . Grieve . Dr. James can arrange counseling . - Because that 's what humans do ? - Because that 's what you need . - When my father died ... - You prayed and you got fixed . - Well , I don 't work like that . - Allison , all I 'm suggesting is you ... I said I 'm fine . All right . ( phone ringing ) - Hey , Emme . - I need to see you . I miss you too , but I can 't today , I 'm out of town . - It 's important . - We can talk now . What 's wrong ? You okay ? I can 't talk about this on the phone . Can you please get down here ? It 's important I see you now . Emme , I 'm really sorry . I gotta take care of something . Just a quick work trip . I 'll see you as soon as I get back . - Flynn , you don 't understand . - I do . I hear you . Look , if it 's urgent , maybe the staff can help , yeah ? No , they can 't . Emme ? ( grunting ) Hello , Carroll . I had a feeling you 'd show up here one day . They got me stationed at Red Stone now . Space and Missile Defense Command . Got you pushing papers at the S.M.D.C. , huh ? Can 't push much else these days . Hey , Katie ! I got someone I 'd like you to meet . This here is Flynn Carroll . We served together in ' 06 , ' 07 . Well , the pleasure is most certainly mine . - Welcome . - Nice to meet you . I hear my husband was a bit of a handful in his unruly youth . This guy ? Always a gentleman . That 's what I keep telling her . You look thirsty . Let 's get you a drink . I 've suggested the cause of death was exsanguination . He ruptured an artery . Generally , this wouldn 't be fatal to a human form Hunter , but he was in a very weak physical state from the torture . The interruption of blood supply also collapsed his echolocation chambers . Under the ears , where the clicks are generated . Briefing in ten . Regan ? I heard you . Don 't be late . You don 't need to see this , Allison . Yes , I do . Okay . ( motor whirring ) Beautiful wife , kids , this house . I gotta hand it to you , man . You really put it together . Nine years is a long time , Flynn . Something tells me you 're not just here for some scotch and a quick " how ya doin ' ? " I need to know what you remember from over there . It was a two-year tour , a lot happened . I 'm talking about the parts you might want to forget . I figured . - Why now ? - Like you said . Nine years . - I figured it 's time . - Bullshit . All these years , you never once called . - Never even came to see me . - You know why . My call to take our unit through that canyon . It was my fault . Whatever happened back then , it 's history . I 've moved on . So should you . I 've tried , man , but I can 't . Something happened to me . To us . I need to get past it . We have the translations Regan 's father did for Finnerman . I 'm attempting to use them for decryption , but there is a question about whether he was , in fact , cooperating . Stay on it . Keep me posted . Briggs , any word on Karp ? I got a guy in CISEN , Mexican intelligence . Says Karp was in the country working on a large-scale weapons deal . We know the Hunters have the cash flow from their drugs trade . Well , Karp 's in the wind now , so that lead 's gone . ( Regan ) How do you screw that up ? I gave you the exact location of his compound . And he cleared it out after you failed to capture anyone . Enough . I 'll contact NSA , TSA . If Karp pops his head up , we 'll know . - You don 't need to do that . - Say again ? Finnerman 's taking point on interagency cooperation . I guess you 're out of the loop . Guess we know whose teat you 're suckling . You don 't know jack shit . - That will be all for now . - Oh , but Regan 's got more to say . Come on . Spit it out , Guano . You captured my father for Finnerman . - Is this true ? - No . How long have you been her lapdog ? How long have you been his bitch . - Back off ! - Come on . Let 's settle this . Girl-to-girl . - What the hell did you just say ? - Briggs ! Regan ! Lockers . Stay out of the lab . My office , right now . _ There you go ! Yeah ! ( grunting ) ( straining ) ( man screaming ) - They got Yates . - Yates ! - We 're coming , buddy ! - ( creature clicking ) ( screaming continues ) ( whispers ) Flynn . Flynn , come here . Yeah , yeah ? I can 't feel it . It 's nothing , all right ? All right , you 're in shock . Damn it , stop lying to me . I 'm gonna die here . We 're walking out of here . - You hear me , huh ? - Yeah . We 're walking out of here . ( creature clicking ) ( clicking continues ) After the firefight , we were taken . I was the third guy the Haji 's pulled out . That 's all I remember . And did you see it ? - The thing that took you out of the pit ? - It ? A man pulled me out . Had a drape pulled over his head so I couldn 't see his face . You were the second to last one taken , - and not by a Haji . - Who took me , then ? - I need you to believe me . - Believe what ? The thing that pulled us out ... was a monster . ( chuckling ) You 're not serious . I didn 't get a good look at it when we were there , but the last couple weeks , I started seeing it , in nightmares , flashes in my mind . I call it the Mandrake , after a book I read when I was a kid . Flynn ? You were hallucinating . We were days without food , - hearing our buddies getting tortured . - I wasn 't hallucinating . - It was real . - Boogeyman out of a kid 's book ? - Flynn , listen to yourself . - I know what I saw . And I know you saw it , too . Look , I get it . You don 't want to deal with it . But Brecke , brother , I 'm begging you . You have to tell me exactly what you saw out there . Just tell me what you remember . - You sure you want to know ? - Yes . I 'm sure . You were the only one they pulled out of that pit . When they put you back in with the rest of us , you were different . Our captors didn 't kill a single one of us . You did . It can 't be true . I 'm not a murderer . What you did was unthinkable . But so was what we went through . No man should have survived that . I don 't blame you for what you did , coming apart like that . I 'm just thankful it wasn 't me . I wouldn 't lie to you , Flynn , I 'm sorry . I need a minute . Sure . ( panting ) ( creature clicking ) You 're not real ! You 're in a book ! You 're not real ! You 're in a book ! ( creature roars ) Two weeks after Regan 's father was detained , you were transferred into Finnerman 's division of the D.O.D. That transfer feels more like quid pro quo than a coincidence . I don 't speak Latin , so . I just follow orders . You took Regan 's father into custody at Finnerman 's behest . Are you still getting orders from her ? Agent Briggs , yes or no ? Are you still getting direct orders from Assistant Secretary Finnerman ? Loyalty is what makes me valuable . If the assistant secretary asks for my discretion , I 'll have to comply . Don 't ask , don 't tell , that 's your policy ? I have nothing to hide , and so help me if that Guano takes another crack at my personal life . I will skin her scaly ass . Secrets will destroy this unit . So will a lack of leadership , sir . You watch your attitude , son . Do not test me . Work your weapons contacts , try to find the line on Karp . The new cryptographer is working on decoding the Hunter language . Regan will work separately with her until you two cool down . Oh , I can cool down , sir . - Guanos can 't . - Get out of my office . ( sighs ) Come with me , Agent . Now . You 're going to torture me for going after Briggs . Bring it on . I can 't hurt any more than I already do . I know you can 't . I also know the treatment makes you feel better . Just a low dose . Take the edge off the pain you 're experiencing . That 's all I 'm suggesting . What ? You 're offering me a treatment ? But you 've said this is like drugs , that I should deal with my shit the human way . When you don 't believe in my God , you won 't accept my comfort . This is all I can offer you , Allison . And what if it affects me in the field ? You 're affected now . - I don 't want to be weak . - That 's the last thing you are . I 'll run it . Nobody else need know . ( high pitch whine ) ( straining ) ( sobbing ) - You need to leave , now . - Excuse me ? After all these years , you came back to dredge up the past ? Bad things happen , I get it . Bob made a terrible mistake , but he forgave himself . - What mistake ? - The ambush . Bob ordered you to go through that canyon . Bob told you it was his call to take us through the canyon ? It wasn 't his fault . I just don 't want to see him clam up again . He 's really opened up ever since the accident . What accident ? What , he didn 't tell you ? Three years ago , Bob drove off the road one night coming home late from work . He went missing for two weeks . He never said a word to me about Paktia before that , but after we found him , he opened up . It 's like he 's a whole new man now . You okay ? I need to use your bathroom . Okay . - ( knocking on door ) - ( Bob ) Flynn ? Everything okay in there ? - Um , be right out . - ( toilet flushes ) You all right ? Yeah , Katie asked me to leave , so ... I know , she overreacted . You should stay for dinner . Yeah , I can 't . After what you just told me , I really should get going . No , that 's exactly why you should stay . Calm down . Pull yourself together . I insist . I 'll just call my kid and tell her I 'll be late . Family first . Get you a beer . ( phone vibrating ) ( Flynn ) Hi , Emme , it 's me . I 'm just checking in , I 'm gonna be home late . - It 's Carroll . - ( fingers snapping ) - Get a line on his cell . - ( Flynn ) I 'm visiting an old friend . I 'll see you soon , kiddo . Carroll 's in trouble . I want everything we 've got on a Lieutenant Colonel Bob Brecke . - Cheers . - Yeah . Lieutennant Colonel Breake is stationed at Redstone . Flynn 's cell pings at his home address . - Hunters want him , too ? - ( Jackson ) We don 't know . Take a team to his address . There 's a D.O.D. chopper standing by . I 'll keep a trace on Carroll 's phone . Whatever you say , sir . Flynn , would you like to lead grace ? It 's been a while . Just keep it honest , you 'll do fine . Dear Father , thank you for this food and the hands that prepared it . Bless us and keep us all safe from harm . Amen . - Amen . - Amen . Amen . ( beeping ) Flynn , it 's five hours and seven minutes since we spoke . Why haven 't you called me back ? I have papers and photos from those boxes in our house . I know Abby isn 't who we thought she was . She knows about Abby ? How ? Play it again . Flynn , it 's five hours and seven minutes since we spoke . Why haven 't you called me back ? I have papers and photos from those boxes in our house . I know Abby isn 't who we thought she was . Everything all right with Emme ? I didn 't realize I mentioned her name . I 've been stalking you . You know , on Facebook . She 's a teenager , yeah ? You must worry about her all the time . Yeah . Scary world out there . Accidents happen . I heard Katie telling you about mine . I have awful good hearing . But you knew that already , didn 't you ? I have papers and photos from those boxes in our house . What boxes is she talking about ? - We need to find out . - Agent Regan will handle it . Perhaps Allison 's not in a fit state with her father 's death so recent . How would you assess your state , Agent Regan ? Are you fit for duty ? Yes , ma 'am . If the girl can 't reach Carroll , she may talk to someone else about what she 's found , so you 're to find out what she knows - and respond accordingly . - You want me to contain her ? Well , I won 't have this unit compromised by a child showing off on the playground . Then find someone else . Get your boy toy Briggs to do your dirty work . I believe that you have requested your father 's remains be returned to you . Yeah , to bury him . Not cut him up like some animal . His years in the black site make him an invaluable specimen to us . Are you even hearing this ? My orders override Commander Jackson 's . You do your job , Agent , and then we 'll talk about your father . I was thinking later , you and I take a drive out to the base . - I can show you around . - I 'd love to . But I got my daughter waiting for me . She 'll understand . I 'll call that kiddo myself if you like . Here . - Let me help you with that . - No , she 's got it . Don 't you , sweetie ? You stay right there . Bob , he 's just trying to help . Thank you . ( roars ) ( grunts ) Boys , stay inside ! ( clicks ) ( roars ) - Hi , Emme . - Who are you ? - I work with Flynn . - Where is he ? I called him six-and-a-half hours ago . Why hasn 't he called me back ? - Is he all right ? - He 's fine . We had a big break in the case . You mean Abby 's murder . He told me you left him a message . That you had information about Abby . I 'd better wait for Flynn . No , it 's cool . You can show me whatever you have , he won 't mind . Okay . But it isn 't here . Then where is it ? I 'll show you . _ Holy shit . ( panting ) No . No . What the fuck ? ( creature snarls ) ( creature clicking ) ( panting ) ( clicking ) ( clicking ) ( straining ) ( Bob grunting ) ( clicking ) - What 's Flynn 's favorite food ? - What ? How would I know ? I thought you said you were his friend . Work friends . We don 't talk about stuff like that . Then what do you talk about ? Our work is confidential . We work for Homeland Security . That 's cool . I didn 't know that . Flynn never talks about his work with you ? No ... We don 't talk about anything , really . - Mostly we just fight . - Where are we going ? My class went on a hike a couple of days ago . They say it 's therapeutic . They found a trailer . Is that where the files are ? I never said I had files . Flynn told me . - What 's wrong ? - I need to pee . - We can go back . - No , it 's okay . I 'll go here . Hey ! ( grunts ) Who are you ? Where is Flynn ? Did you hurt him ? - Are you one of those things ? - I didn 't hurt Flynn . Are you gonna hurt me ? You know something about Abby . Something important and you 're going to show me . Or what ? ( sighs ) - ( gunshot ) - ( grunts ) ( groans ) I 'm sorry . I ... I didn 't mean to hurt you . Not a good move , kid . I 'm not gonna ask again . ( sobbing ) It 's okay . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm here to help . Can you tell me who did this ? Was it a monster ? Was it someone you recognize ? Was it your dad ? Okay , come on . ( man ) Agent Briggs . Get those kids out of here . ( line ringing ) Jackson . Confirming Brecke 's a Hunter , running a hidden comms center . No sign of Flynn . ( clicking and roaring ) ( straining ) This file has pictures of bodies . They 're not human . ( motor whirring ) These are fake , right ? Like alien autopsies are real . That 's what I thought , too . But then I found these . Abby 's skin did the same thing . You saw it ? Just once . Um , I walked in on it once by mistake . She was rubbing lotion on it . It 's exactly the same as in these pictures . And these pictures are of non-human subjects . That 's what it says in the notes . Whatever these things are , that 's what Abby was . And it 's what you are , too , isn 't it ? There 's even more stuff in the ... in the boxes at Flynn 's house . Pictures and files . I read them all . ( grunts ) ( coughing ) ETU is on the way . They 'll find Katie 's body . Not really your concern anymore , is it ? ( growls ) ( clicking ) I don 't know what he sees in you . - Who ? - Musa . If it were up to me , I would have eaten you alive . ( straining ) You were there . You were one of the Hunters at Paktia . ( creature clicking ) ( clicking continues ) ( Flynn ) Brecke , what 's happening ? ( creature clicking ) What the fuck is that ? ( clicking ) The Great Hunt . You boys were the prey . ( growls ) ( grunts ) It 's you . - ( roars ) - You 're the Mandrake ! We 'll finish what I started . ( Flynn screaming ) ( Bob ) Go , Flynn , run . I 'm not leaving you . Run . Run . Run ! Run ! ( all clicking ) ( creature clicking ) ( clicking ) ( creature shrieks ) ( Flynn ) Hang on , Bob . I 'm getting you out of here . I got you , I got you . You saved Bob , and it saved you . - Why ? - Musa thought it was a sign . That 's bullshit . Musa 's been wrong before . I got Bob eventually . ( grunts ) His accident . Your leg . Cut mine off to match him , the lame son of a bitch . ( grunting ) ( screaming ) You murdered my friend ! ( clicking ) ( clicks ) ( yells ) ( creature cries out ) Why did you look in those boxes ? Why couldn 't you just leave this all alone ? Stupid , stupid kid . All this weird stuff was happening . Abby 's missing , Abby 's dead , Abby 's a something . - I needed to know the truth . - Doesn 't help . Can I please just call my dad ? - Flynn is not your dad . - He 's all I 've got ! Too low . The dose was too low . What are you talking about ? Protect the innocents . She 's going to cut him up . Who ? Who 's getting cut up ? You 're not making sense . Someday , we 'll all have wings . ( panting ) ( straining ) ( groans ) Why did Musa let me live ? - ( growls ) - A sign of what ? Tell me ! ( groans ) This ... this is for P.F.C. Brecke , you son of a bitch .

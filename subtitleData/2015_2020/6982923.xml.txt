 Wake up , Victor . No sleeping your last day on the job . 36 more hours , and I 'll be on my second honeymoon . Venice , here I come , and I can 't wait . No more scrubbing frozen snot off my face . No more cataloguing useless cryoseism for credits , and no more spooning with Brad to stay warm at night . You love it . Come on , admit it , Victor , you 'll miss us when you 're gone . This calls ... For a going-away toast . I won 't say no . Hey , Brad , you might want to look at that . Winds are blowing hard from the north , but other than that , nothing . Everything looks normal . Stay warm out there . Toodle-oo . Victor ... I hope your wife gets pregnant first try . Yeah ... Voila . To Brad . To Brad . Uh-oh . Poor Brad . That 's three transmitters out . That is not a good omen . Now what ? What now ? That can 't be right . Have you ever seen the temperature drop that fast ? Victor , did you say the wind was blowing north ? Victor ? This thing 's not working . Brad , can you hear me ? Do you copy ? Come back . Yeah , we need to go after him . His lungs are gonna freeze if he 's out there much longer . There 's no time , look at that . Brad , do you copy ? Move ! Brad ! Brad ! Run , Brad ! Run ! Run ! Come on , Brad ! Come on ! That 's it , come on ! Get up ! No ! Close the door , or we 're both gonna die ! This is it , family , my home away from home . Our home away from home . Our home away from home , I stand corrected . So how long have we- - we 've been coming here for over 20 years , now , jordy . Since before you were even born . It 's Jordan , dad . You should know , you named me . And by the looks of this place , I guess I should be glad that you 've never dragged me on one of your ... Emergency trips . Oh , Jordan ! You know what , babe , I didn 't think our boy had the stamina to be able to complain all the way from south Florida to Alaska , but he 's managed it . It 's impressive . It is , even for a teenager , it 's amazing . You said I could spend break in cabo with Rory . We said you could go to cabo before that stunt you pulled got you suspended . You don 't get to screw up and then go to cabo . It doesn 't work that way . You made your bed , pal . All right , first off , that so-called stunt was hilarious . And Rory was just as guilty as me , and where is he right now ? Cabo . Okay , here 's an idea , when we get back to Florida , you can ask Rory 's parents to adopt you . I like that idea . Yeah ? Yeah . Problem solved . You are , you 're a problem-solver , babe . I gotta get outta here . Mr. and Mrs. summers ! It 's so good to see you . How was your drive ? Long . I mean , we 're used to coming up here in the summertime , so the ice and snow is , well , a bit much . I bet . It 's not what you 're used to in Miami , is it ? Wait , you guys know each other ? Yes , we do . Jordy , this is Claire . Claire , this is our son , jordy . Jordan . But ... hi . Yeah , Claire 's grandparents built the bb . Oh , they make you work here ? That sucks . Oh , no , they don 't make me . Uh , I like working here . Apparently , it 's in my blood . Are your parents here , Claire ? 'Cause we 'd love to take them out for dinner . No , they 're in new Mexico at a hotel and bb conference . We were actually going to close the place up this week till they got your call . Do you have wifi ? Um , say , we , uh ... Well , I gotta work in the morning , and Candace is volunteering at the clinic . I wonder , if you wouldn 't mind , perhaps you can show this guy around a little bit . Dad ! Uh ... I 'd love to give him a tour , Mr. summers . Um , how about ... Tomorrow at 9 : 00 ? I live downstairs , so it 's easy . Okay , well , that 's settled . I 'm going to head upstairs and , uh , unwind . I 'm just going to grab a few more things from the truck . - See you later . - Yeah , see you later . - Want to fire these upstairs ? - Yeah , sure . Don 't forget that , too . Are you gonna- - uh , yeah , I 'll see you tomorrow . Yeah . See you tomorrow . Wow . Up before noon on a weekend ? I 'm shocked . Jordan summers , what have you done with my real son ? Very funny . Now I remember . Claire said to meet you here at 9 : 00 . Why is it you 're never punctual when I need you to be ? Don 't answer that . Speaking about being on time , we are meeting your dad for dinner tonight , so , meet me at the clinic at 5 : 30 . We 'll walk over together , okay ? Claire can tell you how to get there . Yup . Seriously , jordy . You are on your last leg here . It took a lot of convincing on our part to keep you from getting kicked out of school . So ? That school sucks . You should have just let them expel me . " So " ? What about your friends and your teammates , not to mention your entire future ? Oh , jordy ... You are gonna have to start caring about something , sometime real soon . Life is so wasted when you don 't . Sure , mom . We 're not done talking about this . Morning . Morning , Claire . - Hey . - Hi . Did you sleep okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I did . Well , uh ... shall we ? Yes , please . 5 : 30 , jordy . Okay , mom . Bye . Have fun . December 21st , Pemberton forest . I 've been in the migratory area of the rusty blackbird for approximately the last three hours and have not seen birds of any kind . I am utterly baffled by this . Generally , this time of year , there 'd be hundreds of them in these woods . I 'm not really sure what to do right now . Where are you ? What happened to you , little fella ? Where are all your friends ? Looks like I 'm going to be late for dinner . Oh , yeah . Sorry , the only spare I have is my brother 's mini bike . Wouldn 't your brother be pissed if I 'm using this ? I 'd be . Um .. Not unless you call him at college and tell him . You could keep it while you 're here if you want . God , yeah . Where is everybody ? It 's the off-season . So , this is downtown Pemberton . And , uh , pretty much the only hotel we have is right here . And then there 's a grocery store around the corner , but it 's got pretty much everything . And there 's Fiona . She used to baby-sit me when I was a kid . She taught me how to quad , how to do a French manicure . She 's the best . So , the only exciting things you can show me in this town is a hotel and a grocery store ? Oh- - I should be in cabo right now . Poor Miami . You want to sit in the sunshine drinking brewskies with your bros ? Can 't hack the real weather , huh ? Come on , I 'll buy you a hot chocolate . Okay . So ... How come you 've never come up here with your parents before ? Work trips . Well , you could have made it happen if you wanted it to . Well , I guess they didn 't want me roaming around the wilderness unsupervised . You know ... They talk about you all the time . Yeah , sure . No , really , they- - whoa ! What the hell was that ? That was Mr. Watson , our resident Jeff Gordon . He 's pretty mean , and he also drinks and drives , so I 'd avoid him if I were you . Come on , Miami . Bet you 've never seen a real dump before . Anything to get off these menacing streets . Hello ? Hello ! Didn 't mean to barge in , I ... Sorry , I ... I knocked , but nobody answered . Roger summers . It 's Tim . I , uh , I was just wondering if you might have a phone . I 'm not getting any reception , and I 'm late for dinner with my wife and son . It 's on the wall . Thank you . I appreciate that . And this is the clinic that your mom helps out at every summer . People round here would go without medical treatment until it got real bad if she didn 't . Civilization is a long way away . So , um ... You wouldn 't want to maybe hang out again tomorrow , would you ? I don 't know if I can . I 'm pretty busy with the bb . Oh . No , yeah , no , it 's ... It 's no biggie . I 'm kidding . You 're the only guest . Right . So , would you be up for something a little more backwoodsy ? Think you can handle a real winter , jordy ? Oh , I can handle it . I stopped shivering after my third cup of hot chocolate , remember ? This time , you 're gonna want your mittens . Right . Well , if you just let her know that I called , and tell her I 'm sorry I 'm not going to make it for dinner . All right , thank you . Get ahold of your wife ? Uh , no , she was just with a patient . I left a message with the nurse . You 're , uh , you 're Dr. Tim Hughes , emergency climate coalition . I was . I left the scientific community a long time ago . Looks like you left everything else , too . And why not ? The planet is dying , Roger , and we 're the ones killing it , and no one wants to do anything to reverse it , because everybody is making too much money . It seems to me that you were making a difference . Kyoto . Emissions controls . A lot of that happened because you raised your voice . It 's like bailing out the Titanic with a soup spoon . Well , you gotta start somewhere , I figure . We 're dead men walking , and no one seems to care . Do you think that it could happen all at once ? What ? The climate disasters that you forecast . The rusty blackbird 's numbers have been decreasing rapidly . This year , they migrated early . Today , I found this . It 's frozen solid . It gets cold up here at night . It 's not that cold . Something 's very , very wrong . What 's that , north of town ? It 's a research outpost . It 's run by multiple universities , couple of government agencies . Basically , they study the weather , seismic activity , tagging animals . Whatever they gotta do to spend Grant money . I wonder if they might have some data that might help me figure out what 's going on here . How long would it take me to get up there ? Depends on how you intend to travel . On foot ? Are you gonna go now ? Well , if I come back tomorrow , then I 'm going to have to travel twice the distance . It 's getting dark out there . Can 't let you do that . You can bunk down here tonight , and I 'll take you in the morning by snowmobile . Well , I 'd appreciate that . I 'm gonna have to use your phone again . Knock yourself out . So , how was your date ? It wasn 't a date , but it was fine . Not so bad here after all , is it ? Dr. summers , your husband called twice . Once to say that he wouldn 't make it back tonight for dinner , and the second time to say that he wouldn 't make it back at all tonight . He said that he was snowmobiling up to a research station with another scientist he met in the woods ? Does that make sense to you ? Because it sounds like the craziest thing I 've ever heard . Well , you 've obviously never met my dad , because that 's actually typical . Oh , come on , jordy , we can still have dinner together- - no , forget it , mom , okay ? Let 's just go back to the bb . I 'm sorry . It 's okay , lettie . It 's not your fault . I appreciate your helping me out . Just so you know , I don 't give a damn about your blackbird . I just don 't want you going out into the woods and getting yourself killed . I don 't need that on my conscience . You sound like my son . They should have heard us coming . As boring as it is out here , they should be out here with bells on . That can 't be good . Thanks . Yeah . Hello ? Shouldn 't the generator have kicked in ? Maybe it 's frozen . Yeah . Frozen solid . How is that even possible ? I don 't know , but right now , I think we need to worry about it happening again and not how it happened . Agreed . The missing birds , it suggests that this isn 't random . Animals are smarter than humans . They know . Think we better get that generator started , maybe fire up the computers , see if they recorded anything . Take this walkie . We 'll stay in touch . I 'll take the guys outside . We 'll arrange to bury them later . All right . So ... how do you like the north now , Miami ? It is awesome . It 's like being on a freezing cold jet ski . Except , you know , with a lot more clothes on . Right . Come on , I want to show you something cool . We got power . Nice work , Roger . Now , get back here and let 's figure out how this thing happened . Wow . Empty . Nothing but us . You could yell your deepest , darkest secrets from this spot , and no one will hear you . This is my favorite spot . Come on , you try . Beautiful . I mean , it 's ... It 's beautiful out here . What the ... Roger ? Roger , you 've got to get inside now . The temperatures are plummeting . Roger , do you copy ? Roger- - Roger ! We 've got to feed the fire . We can 't let it go out . Whoa , cool ! No ... No , that was weird . We should go . Uh , one thing that you never mess with up here is weird weather . We should get out of here . Hey , how 'd it go ? Are you engaged yet ? I think we 've got to have the third date first before talking about eternity . So there 's going to be a third date ? I hope so . Well , uh , your dad isn 't here yet , and I need to finish up , so just try to keep yourself busy for a few minutes , - I 'll come find you ? - Yeah , sure . Where 's Claire ? You should have invited her to have dinner with us . I could go check on her , if you want . You 're not going anywhere , don Juan . I will meet you in the waiting room in 20 minutes . This family dinner will happen . Just stay out of trouble , and out of everyone 's way , okay ? No promises . And who is don Juan ? Is he the dude riding the donkeys on the coffee cans ? Yes . Damn it . Cold kills the batteries . Yeah . My family 's going to be starting to worry right about now . I 've got to find some way to get a message to them . I checked . Nothing here that communicates with the outside world is working . You find anything else useful ? Well ? According to the data collected by the weather monitoring equipment before it went out , suggests that we 're experiencing an upper atmospheric cyclonic event . It could be stratospheric , maybe mesospheric , I don 't know . It 's unprecedented , and this is what 's dropping temperatures so quickly ? The air is being pulled up into the upper reaches of the atmosphere . It 's getting supercooled . As it cools , it gains density , and drops back down to the earth as a sub-freezing blast of wind . It 's like a pinwheel , blowing tendrils of cold off of a fan . That 's why it 's not hitting everywhere at once ? Its tendrils ? Otherwise people would have noticed . Exactly . It 's not setting off alarms because it appears isolated . But it 's not . The next one should hit at 2 : 06 A.M. It 's going to last 10 minutes and 15 seconds . We are in the center , the most intense part of the storm . If that 's the case , then Pemberton could get hit , too . Yeah , the tail end , but it won 't be as cold there as it is here , at least not yet . So , are we going to be okay here ? For now . What 's the cause of it ? The cause ? Emissions . Holes in the ozone . Nuclear reactors warming our oceans . Take your pick . We could be looking at a new ice age . But on the plus side , the cold zones are relatively low . The blasts of wind are basically on the surface . No higher than 8,000 feet , so at least we won 't have any planes falling from the skies . Great . At least that 's something . So , what can we do about it ? Nothing . What do you mean , nothing ? I mean , nothing . Our control over this domain , it ends here . So what , we just , we just die ? You , me , everyone else ? There 's got to be some way that we can combat it . Roger , the cyclone , up there , it 's growing . More and more air is getting pulled up into it . Its frequency is increasing by 50 % with each turn . It 's only a matter of time before it threatens the entire northern hemisphere . The survival zones , the gaps between the tendrils , they 're closing . It 's becoming one giant blast . So--so what ... How long does the danger zone last ? What 's the duration of it ? The duration is increasing as well . As I said , the next one is 10 minutes and 15 seconds . Then 14 minutes and 32 seconds , and then 18 minutes and 80 seconds . I don 't know , 22 minutes , 26 minutes , so on , and so on , and so on ! All right , so it increases by four minutes every single time , it 's like this .. Self-sustaining wind . It 's going to kill everything in its path . Weather is self-regulating , isn 't it ? I mean , it 'll stabilize eventually . I mean , there must be some kind of way that we can accelerate that . No . Too late . No one listened when we had a chance . We 're done . There 's got to be something we can do stop it . How ? What do you want me to do ? What , you want to shoot a rocket into space ? Blow up a nuke ? No one is looking for it , not for this . We have no communications , we got nothing . How are we supposed to stop it ? I don 't know . But you might . I know who you are , Tim . I know that you tried for years to convince the world about the dangers of climate change . There certainly was a point where you cared about people . Yes , I spent my entire career , my life , trying to get the world to understand the dangers we faced , and what did I get ? I got ignored , ridiculed , rebuffed , and threatened . Well , this is about more than just us , now , though , isn 't it ? I read about what happened to your ... Your wife and daughter , their death in Katrina . I mean , there are no words . It 's tragic . But there are other families out there . My family is out there . Good evening , nurse lettie . Hey , Jordan . How 's it going ? How are you liking it here so far ? Okay , well , between just you and me , I 'm kind of glad I 'm not in cabo right now . So , um ... So , Claire 's a nice girl . Hey ... Is there anything good in the lost and found ? I doubt it , but you can have a look . So , Claire , um ... Do you know if she 's seeing anybody , or anything ? I 'm pretty sure Claire would tell you if she had a boyfriend . If that 's what you 're asking . What ? No , I ... Hello . You never know what you 're going to find in the lost and found . Oh ... Well , so much for an easy night . Hey . Sorry , kiddo . With these rolling power outages , it got real busy here . We 're one of the only places with a generator . Where 's your dad ? He didn 't show up . Again . That 's odd . No , not really . He didn 't show up last time . Why would today be any different ? Excuse me . Excuse me ? Can I get some help here , ma 'am ? Of course , sir . I 'm sorry , jordy . I have to take care of this . Yeah . Yeah , sure . Okay , let 's see , what do we have here ? All right- - oh , watch your back . It 's okay , it 's okay . Careful . What happened ? It 's Mr. Watson . Frozen solid in his scooter last night . Jordan ... The look on his face , sheer terror . Like he was running away from something . How does something like this even happen ? Damndest thing I 've ever seen . No service . They don 't even know what 's coming , and they 're not gonna . My wife 's been coming up here with me to volunteer for years . This is the first time that my kid 's ever come . I can 't even warn them to stay inside . I can 't warn anybody . You can 't warn them , but maybe you can get them out . We can 't stop the storm , but we can run from it . At least we can try . What are you talking about ? There 's a helipad just north of town . 8,000 feet . Yeah , that 's right . Look . There . Anywhere south of there , they can survive the storm . It 's the only place they 'll be safe . I mean , it 's a chance . I 'll take it . Temperatures have returned to safe levels . We should move . Yeah . Well , there you go , Mr. Wallace . It 's good as new . Although i wouldn 't recommend going back out on the ice tonight . You should rest and keep that hand dry for a few days . Don 't worry , doc . Cold happens up here . It 's not like it 's some evil monster out to get you . It just happens . Tourists ... Well- - uh , lettie , um , has my husband checked in ? No . Can you come get me when he calls ? I can , but listen , he 's been coming here for over 20 years . He 's not nearly as green as everybody is making him out to be . I 'm sure he 's fine , okay ? Thanks . I appreciate it . Okay . Snowmobile 's ready . I siphoned some gasoline from the generator . If we leave soon , we can make it to your cabin before the blast hits . I 'm not coming with you . The hell you 're not , you 'll die here . You were right . No one knows about this , and a phone call isn 't going to convince anyone . Governments need real proof before they 're going to spend money . They need this data . If they had it , they might try . Tim- - hundreds of millions are gonna die . I can 't have that on my head . Not when I 'm the only person on the planet who can do something about it . What are you going to do ? I 've just got to figure out a way to get the signal out . All right , I 'll go , I 'll warn my family , and I 'll come back . This storm , it 's not going to stop . It 's going to blow until it blows itself out . And hey , I ... I came to the north to die anyway . My wife , she 'd think it was pretty funny , me dying like this . Yeah ... Go save your family . I 'm good with this . Hey , jordy , can you turn on the news ? The cold weather anomalies that are reaping havoc all over the northern hemisphere are still baffling scientists . Russia reports power outages to at least four million people , and parts of Canada are without communication . Now , at home , the weather board has not made any official comment , and the white house is asking Americans to stay indoors and remain calm . We should go and look for dad . I mean , he should been back by now . You have no idea where he is , no idea where you 're going , and no way to get there . I don 't care . I mean , we should at least try . Jordy , he 's a grown-up . It 's not your job to worry about him . Candace , Wilma is on the phone . She thinks she might have swallowed a spider . Okay . I gotta get this . Yeah , well ... I do worry about him . Answer . Come on , Candace , pick up . Dad ? Jordy ! Nice , dad . Nice no-show . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I had you come up here . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry i wasn 't around more when you were younger , and you wanted me to be , but I want you to know you 're number one . All right ? You and your mom , you 're number one . I love you , jordy . Dad ? What 's wrong ? There 's a terrible storm coming . And when the wind blows , if you 're outside , it will freeze you solid , so you 've got to stay inside , all right ? You hear me ? I hear you . Okay , so where are you ? At the clinic , me and mom . That 's good . It 's a new building , and it 's got emergency power there . You 're gonna be ... You 're gonna be just fine there for a while , all right ? Now , this storm is gonna hit Pemberton at 11 : 06 , okay ? It 's going to blow for 18 minutes and 32 seconds , and you , you 've gotta be inside during that time period . Now , here 's what you 've got to look for , okay ? The wind is gonna change direction . You 've gotta be inside during that time period . Are you okay , dad ? I 'm coming for you , all right ? I 'm gonna- - dad ? Dad ! Tim ? Tim ? Yeah . I got a message out to my family . They know enough now . I 'm on my way to them . That is great news . Hey , listen , I think I figured out a way to transmit the data . I 've just got to get it up to the airwaves . Get your family to the helipad and you get ' em out . Will do . Tim ? Yeah . Save as many as you can . You got it . Listen , make sure the , um , the actor that plays me in the movie is better looking than the actor that plays you . It 's got to be realistic . Copy that . Good luck to you , Roger . Power 's out again . Is there coffee ? Yeah . It 's freezing . Hey , everyone . I just got off with dispatch . Now , the power 's going to be messed up for a while . I guess the news is saying that we should all stay inside . Personally , I 'm heading back to the city while there 's still time . No power ? I 'm on electric at home . I 'll catch my death of cold . You guys cannot go outside yet . Hold on . Hello , everyone . My name is Dr. Candace summers . My husband is Roger summers . Most of you know us from our annual summer trips up here . He 's informed me that a dangerous storm is headed this way . Freezing winds , actually . Look , I don 't know all the details . There 's nothing on the news about a storm . That 's because they don 't know . We 've all been through this kind of weather before . It 's nothing new , isn 't that right ? This is different . If you go outside when it hits , you 'll freeze to death in a matter of seconds . If a storm 's coming , we need to get back to the road . You 're not listening , okay ? None of you are safe . Your homes , they may not be warm enough to keep you and your families alive . Where are we supposed to go ? We should all stay here . Inside , for the time being . And then what ? We wait for my husband . He 'll have a plan . She 's from Miami . Well , that explains it . Honey , we should go with him . No , you 're not- - kid , I drive truck through all kinds of weather . I 'm getting while the getting 's good . But it 's not good . You have to stay here . You won 't be safe out there . My partner is loading up a patient for transfer right now . It 's an eight-hour drive down south to the city . We can 't just stay here , we 've got a job to do . Maybe we 'll come with you . Okay , we got a convoy . No , wait , please . My husband will be here soon . He 's on his way . He has all the information about this storm . If you could just wait for a few more minutes , please ! We deal with bad weather here all the time , doctor . If we 're not out there helping folks , no one is . Please ... All right , I 've got 30 minutes . Okay , what am i going to do here ? Shelter . I 'm going to get Claire . No , you 're not . You 're going to stay right here like your father asked you to . The clinic is much better insulated than the bb . That is exactly why i have to go get her . She doesn 't even know that she 's in danger out there . Jordan summers , I forbid you to leave this building . Come on . Please , god , let this work . I want to see my family again . Crash victim in room seven just checked himself out . That was our last patient . Oh , no . I don 't know what to do if they won 't listen . You know , this town is full of hard-working , decent people , and every single one of them is hard-headed . We survive out here . I didn 't get to speak with Roger , but from what Jordan said , I don 't if there will be survivors this time . It 's what we do , Candace . Where 's Jordan ? Jordy ? We have to find him . Jordan ! Go ! Now ! Get back ! Move ! Move ! Oh , god ... All right . Come on , baby . Yeah ! Atta girl . Atta girl . Really ? Damnit ! Come on ! We 're closed , sir . - You scared the hell outta me . - I 'm Fiona . Roger . What are you doing here ? It was so cold at home . I thought it would be warmer here , but I was wrong . It 's worse here . This building isn 't insulated enough . We 've gotta get out of here . What 's going on out there ? Something is cooling the atmosphere to the point where the temperature outside is dropping below survivable levels . It 's not even snowing out there . It 's too cold outside to snow . What should we do ? We 've got to get inside a cooler . You want me to get in a fridge ? Look , I 'm just making it up as I go along . I 'm no expert here . Great . Well , you 're still alive . That 's something , I guess . That 's right . Come on . The cooler will be well insulated . It 'll be cool in there , but it will be a heck of a lot warmer than out here . You hope . I do . I hope . At least we won 't starve . We won 't need to be in here too long . It 'll be 26 minutes , then the temperature will come up temporarily , then we can go to the clinic . What 's at the clinic ? My family 's there . We 'll go there , we 'll get them , and then we 'll get out of here . You too . Thank you , Roger . Yeah . Now let 's just try and keep moving a little bit , keep our temperature up , all right ? Huh . It works . God , I love science . Now let 's get you in the air . Are you sure it 's safe to go out there ? The storm comes and goes , and each time , the window between cold snaps grows shorter , eventually , there won 't be anywhere safe to go . So , what should we do ? We 're going to make like the rusty blackbird . What ? We 're gonna fly south , all right ? We 're gonna go to the airport , we 're gonna get a helicopter , and fly above the winds till we get to a warmer spot . You know how to fly a helicopter ? Yeah , we 're gonna figure that out . Come on , call me , either of you . Lettie , what are you doing ? Well , this 'll help keep the heat in in case the generator goes . In case somebody makes it back . Right . Roger ! Thank god , you 're here . Oh , I was so worried about you . Where 's Jordan ? He went for Claire . I demanded that he stay here , but he didn 't listen . - We 're going to get them . - Then what ? We 're going to fly out of here . The closest runway is 15 miles away . And there 's a killer storm hunting us down . How is that going to work ? What we need is a refrigerated truck . It keeps the cool in , but it would also keep the cool- -out . So , back to the store ? We have one for deliveries . Okay , perfect . You two get the truck , I 'll get Jordan and Claire . And , lettie , can you pack up my medical bag for when I get back ? I don 't think we should split up . The bb isn 't a new building . I have to go get them . Okay , well , we have an hour and 24 minutes until the next blast . Set your watch . Okay , we 'll meet back here ? If , uh ... If things go wrong ... We meet back here . I love you . You too . Go ! Oh , no . Oh , no . No ... Jordy ... God ! Mom ! What are you doing ? Oh , jordy ! Don 't do that to a guy . Don 't you ever do that to me again , you hear ? Okay , I hear you . I 'm so glad you two are okay . He saved my life , Dr. summers . I didn 't know . I would have gone to bed and never woken up . That 's what families do . Now , listen , we don 't have much time . We 've got to get back . Wait , what about dad ? It 's okay . He 's safe . Come on . Where are you going ? Northerners , we know all the cold weather tricks . Now you know . You better do something with it . All right , let 's jump ' er . Let 's try it . Ready ? Yeah ! Whoo ! Okay ... Piece of cake , huh ? Yeah , right . I found a couple more , lettie . Oh , great . Did you get the truck ? Yeah . Did you get Jordan and Claire ? I sent them to turn the thermostats and the lights down in the rest of the hospital , except for this area right here . That generator 's been working for two days . Makes sense . The white house official statement is , " we just didn 't know . " But Dr. Tim Hughes knew , then and now . There 's been no further contact with him since his life-saving signal went out to the world from a remote region in northern Alaska . Mass evacuations are underway everywhere in the northern hemisphere . Airports are fueling every plane to save as many lives as possible . If you own a plane or have a pilot 's license , you 're asked to contact authorities and make yourself known . If you can , get south . If you can 't , get indoors . New buildings with new insulation are better . Do whatever it takes to stay warm , and wait it out . Now , emergency relief actions are already planned for when the storm has blown itself out in seven days . He did it . Was that you ? No , that was Dr. Tim Hughes . Dad ! Jordy ! You made it , man ! I 'm sorry I made you come up here . No , I 'm sorry about being a jerk about cabo . It doesn 't matter . It was my fault , I 've got to take responsibility . It just doesn 't matter . The most important thing to remember is to stay warm . All right , we 've got seven minutes . Everybody hunker down . ... stay calm . Okay , it 's time . Get inside , get a fire going . Godspeed , everyone , and good luck . Temperatures are stabilizing . Let 's go . Lettie ? What are you doing ? I 'm not coming , Candace . You can 't stay here ! I was born here , Candace . The people I love live here . If people need help , this is where they 'll come , and I won 't abandon them . No ... Lettie , please . You can 't . She 's staying ! Come on , hon ' . There 's nothing we can do . Come on . Easy , Roger . Slow and steady keeps us on the road when it comes to cold driving . Slow and steady will have us dead on the road . How long to the airport ? Normally , it takes 20 minutes . Normally . What is that up ahead ? Oh ... That doesn 't look good . Why are we stopping ? I don 't know . Hey ! Is everything okay ? It 's fine ! Stay put . Are they are all ... Yeah . Is this , uh ... Is this the only way to the airport ? Yes . There 's no other way through . Are we going to tell them about this ? Not if we don 't have to . Hey , why aren 't we moving ? Oh , my god , what happened ? Come on . Is something wrong ? The road up ahead is blocked . Well , what do we ... What do we do now ? We get in the Van . Come on . Let 's hope we 're right about this . It 's working . This is colder than I anticipated . We 're only going to be able to stand one or two more of these inside here . I need to call my parents . Tell them what 's happening . Cell phone service will be down by now . We 'll find them when this is all over , okay ? What are we going to do now ? There isn 't another way , is there ? Not without going back to town . No ... I know a shortcut . What 's that ? We could take white bridge . No . Wait ... what 's white bridge ? It 's the old direct . It crosses the river and goes straight to the airport . Well , that 's perfect , let 's do that . It 's condemned . Parts of the foundation are cracked . Damaged by ice . Last year , two kids died crossing over on quads . Oh , my god ... Not perfect . It 's not an option . They were chasing the edge . What does that mean ? It 's stupid , it 's like a dare . The boys will see who can ride closest to the edge where its falling apart . If it won 't hold a quad , it won 't hold us . It will , though . I 've done it . With my brother , we 've driven across in his truck when we were driving back from a party once . No , this sounds too risky . It would get us to the airport . And the road itself , it isn 't that bad . Well , we 're all dead if we stay here anyway . I don 't know that we have another option . Let 's go . You 've got to be kidding me . - What ? - Gas . You felt it back there . That air conditioner was the only thing that kept us alive . All right , how long is it going to take us to get to the airport once we cross the bridge ? Windy roads , but 40 minutes ? All right , and then we need another half an hour with the engine running once the storm comes . We 're not going to have enough gas to keep the engine running during the next blast . It 's 40 minutes by truck . On foot ? We can 't make it . We 're not gonna make it . Yes , we will . I 'm going to drive through the next cold blast . No , you 're not . It 's the only way . You are the only one who can fly a helicopter . There 's no way I 'm letting a mother or children do this . Fiona ... That 's what we do in the north , Roger . We look out for each other , and we sacrifice . No . You know how this is going to end , so let 's stop wasting time . You need to stop this truck , and get in the back . We 'll , uh ... We 'll winterize you as best we can . Put candles in here , and we 'll crank the heat . Then maybe you 'll have a chance . Let 's stop wasting time . - Give me some blankets . - Why ? Come on , just give me some blankets . I haven 't got time here . Roger , what 's going on ? I 'll be right back . It 's okay , all right ? Thank you , Fiona . I 'll see you at the airport . It was a good town , Roger . The best . Get going . Dad , what 's going on ? Sit down . We don 't have enough gas to stop and make it there , so Fiona is going drive through the next blast . What ? No , she 'll freeze ! No , listen , we 've winterized the cab as best as we can . There 's a chance that she 'll make it . Dad , man , we can 't do this . Well , if we don 't , we 'll all freeze . And if she freezes and drives off the road ? That 's not going to happen . Hey , you okay ? I 'm just so sick of this . God , I know . Me too . You know , you should probably eat something . Calories equals energy , and energy equals heat . I 'm fine , Miami . Did you mean what you said ? About finding my parents ? Absolutely . Okay , we 've got seven minutes until the next blast . We must be on the bridge . It will hold . Oh , god ... It 's all right . Almost there ... Almost there . We 're going to be okay . - We 've stopped . - Yeah . We 've gotta go out and get her . No , we can 't go out and get her . It 's too cold . You won 't make it to the front of the truck . Fiona- i understand that . - Dad-- there 's nothing we can do , jordy . I 'm sorry . All right , that 's it . We haven 't got much time , let 's go . Fiona ? I 'm so sorry . Good people . Come on . Let 's go . What now ? The two of you , find the office and find the keys . - On it . - It should be obvious . Come on , Miami . Roger ... All we need to do is get to 8,000 feet , and we 'll be fine , okay ? I love you . I love you . Come on . Let 's get this bird out of here . Can I tell you something ? Yeah , sure . I 'm actually ... Pretty freaked out right now . I know . I am too . It 's going to be okay . Are you ... Really scared ? Well , I 'm pretty sure my dad 's never flown a helicopter before , so ... There must be a better way than this . Well , we don 't have anything to tow it with . We 've just got to clear the doors . We got the keys ! Okay , good . Give us a hand here . Jordy , here . Already ? I 'm sick of that alarm . All right , everybody in . We 're running out of time . Come on . Inside , go ! Hit the heat , it 's under the vent there . Dad , I had no idea you knew how to fly a helicopter . Claire 's right . You 're kind of cool . I 'm full of surprises . Dad , we 're icing up . Just watch the altimeter . When we get to 8,000 feet , we 'll be above the arctic blast , and it will stop . We can make it . Yeah , we can . Okay , we 're still rising . We 're close . Almost there . - We did it ! - Whoo ! Are we safe ? We 're clear , we 're gonna be okay . Yeah , we 're gonna be all right . We 'll just have to touch down to refuel , but we have a radio now . We can get information . We 'll just continue further south . Nice flying , dad . We can 't keep touching down for gas and food , Roger . What are we going to do ? What do you expect , mom ? It 's an ice age . Roger ... We 'll find Claire 's parents , and we 'll start over again . Rebuild our communities . Try not to make the same mistakes we made last time . For Tim and Fiona ... And all those people that didn 't make it .

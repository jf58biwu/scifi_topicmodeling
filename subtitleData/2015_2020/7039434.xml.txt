 NOLAN : Previously on Defiance ... I see a bright light . It 's a man , with a powerful flashlight . MAN : Amanda , you 're mine . The man who raped me . I was living in New York , working as an entry clerk at E-Rep headquarters . Why are you telling me all this ? I didn 't want you to think you 're alone . We 've received a message from Datak and Stahma . Good news , I hope . They were successful in planting the shrill-infested weapons in the local armory . The town 's entire gun supply was destroyed . DATAK : What does that mad man want ? ( BEEPING ) He wants us to blow up the St. Louis Arch . AMANDA ( ON RADIO ) : People of Defiance , our darkest hour has passed . The lights are finally back on . Thanks to our Omec friends , the mines are open , and the gulanite is flowing at a rapid pace . Slowly but surely , we 're getting back on our feet . 'Cause when we 're up against the wall , when many of us have just about lost hope , we persevere . Standing beside each other . Always remember who we are . We are free . We are proud . We are Defiance . ( BEEPING ) I can 't speak for the rest of you , Defiance , but I 'm inspired . Here 's some old-world grunge going out to my man , Alak Tarr , wherever you are . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ) I notice you didn 't tell the town we were free , proud and defenseless . No need to start a panic . The shrill destroyed every weapon in our armory . ( WHISPERS ) I don 't know about you , but I 'm feeling pretty damned panicked . ( MUSIC CONTINUES ON RADIO ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) NOLAN : I think I got something here . NOLAN : Amanda ! We 've been going through the old E-Rep files . I think I might have a line on where we can find some weapons . ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) ( GASPS ) ( SCREAMS ) Ripped By mstoll ( SOBBING ) ( GASPS ) ( SCREAMS ) ( SOBBING ) RAHM : My fellow Votans . I am Commander General Rahm Tak , of the Votanis Collective . Today is a special day . Today is a day of celebration . I have shown you mercy . Hologram . I have come here today to liberate you . You three . Check the arch for casualties . You have so much to thank us for . He 's gotta be projecting from somewhere close . I have shown you mercy . You still have your homes . You still have your lives . But the continued survival of Defiance is in your hands . I am an honest man . Far more honest than your human mayor . My spies have informed me that all the weapons in your armory have been rendered useless , a fact Amanda Rosewater has kept from you . Nolan , shut this down . Working on it . Like all pink-meat ' humans , she 's a liar . I am coming to your town . Votans of Defiance , I make you this promise . Your life will be spared if you surrender . But for those of you who side with the humans , there will be no mercy . ( CHATTER ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) NOLAN : The Arch is only the first cell , though . Hitting back will require weapons , and lots of ' em . We may find them here . Station Arrowhead , 300 miles north , an E.M.C. black site , built during the Pale Wars and been sealed up tight ever since the ' 20s . How do we know it hasn 't already been found , looted ? We don 't . But look at the manifest . Automatic weapons , explosives , medical , everything we could hope for . And if we drove all night , we could be there by mid-morning . - It 's heavy firepower . - Mmm-mmm . Worth rolling the dice . I 'm riding shotgun . You heard the lady . Pack a bag . Wheels up at sundown . Not you . You 're benched . - C 'mon . - Benched . They blew up the Arch . - Don 't care . - Nolan . You 're gonna stay here with Berlin , you 're gonna figure out who planted those explosives . And you two ? You 're gonna work together on this , you hear me ? ( SWING MUSIC PLAYS ) BORDEEN VALLEY 200 MILES WEST OF DEFIANCE You know , everyone says that Buddy Rich is the best drummer . I like Gene Krupa better . Krupa , yes . Sing , Sing , Sing . Wonderful beat . A despicable species , the humans , but they do have rhythm . ( BREATHLESSLY ) General . Sir . Sir , I have an update on Defiance . Datak and Stahma have destroyed the Arch . ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) Ha ! Excellent ! And the hologram ? The entire town saw it . Don 't look so gloomy , Alak . Thanks to your resourceful parents , you live to see another day . But , Sir . There is one more thing . Speak freely . There are two Omec in Defiance . One male , one female . Enchanters . The Omec ? Like , from back on Votan ? Aren 't they like ... Quiet ! I 've consulted with my Indogene brothers . And we 're fairly certain that the male is Eksu Tsuroz T 'evgin . He 's a prominent figure in Omec culture . Scientist , inventor , politician and war hero . Well , why isn 't this glorious Renaissance man back home , dead in space with the rest of the enchanters ? Our long-range scans indicate that he has a ship . It 's in orbit , hovering above Defiance . A warship ? We 're not sure . Its power signature , however , is very low . It 's in need of repair . They need gulanite . That 's why they 're in Defiance . A fully functional Omec warship could destroy the entire Votanis Collective . Eksu Tsuroz T 'evgin needs to die . Send word to Datak and Stahma . Tell them I need it done immediately . STAHMA : What he 's demanding is reckless . We must refuse this order . That 's not an option , and you know it . It 's too soon after the Arch . The entire town 's on high alert . Rahm Tak is going to get us caught ! It 's a risk we have to take . He has our son ! What ? Out with it . I 've given this a great deal of thought . I don 't believe Rahm Tak will ever release Alak alive . How can you say that ? He married a human girl . Rahm Tak won 't let that go unpunished . No . You 're wrong . Rahm and I shared an oath . I looked him in the eye . Rahm Take eyes are empty . Even if you 're right , it changes nothing . Killing the Omec buys us time . - Time for what ? - I don 't know ! Time to think , to come up with some sort of counter-strategy . What other choice do we have ? The Omec has to die . I suppose you 're right . We have betrayed our neighbors , and so long as that madman has the power to expose us , we must obey his commands . For our own survival , if not Alak 's . Is that poison ? I 'll fill a hidden needle and inject the Omec during coitus . Coitus ? It 's a human word . It means ... Yeah , I know what it means . T 'evgin will suffer cardiac arrest , leaving no evidence of foul play . Well , surely there 's some other way . My way is effective and safe . Rest assured , love , I will think only of you . STATION ARROWHEAD 312 MILES NORTH OF DEFIANCE Looks like it 's been recently plowed . According to this , underground access is in that barn . ( BARN DOOR OPENS ) ( INHALES DEEPLY ) Ah ! That barn smell . You mean manure ? Whatever happened to romance ? I killed it and ate it . Oh ! Nolan , you okay ? ( GROANS ) Just a headache . ( GROANS ) ( GROANS ) Ah ! ( NOLAN GROANS ) ( GROANS ) oh ! Leave the fingers . Leave , leave , leave . Ah , ow ! Come with me . I don 't suppose I could hang on to my gun ? No . NOLAN : C 'mon , pal ... RINGO : George isn 't your pal . And neither am I. It 's amazing . GEORGE : You look just like her . Like who ? The girl from the movies . What movies ? What are you talking about ? No more talking . AMANDA : Niles ? Oh , Nuts . ( PIANO PLAYS IN BACKGROUND ) After our garrison left Defiance , Viceroy Mercado decided to lead us back to New York to provide aid and comfort . It was futile . Before we made Cincinnati , we were overrun by refugees streaming west . POTTINGER : They were burned and bloodied and sick . They 'd lost everything . It was heartbreaking , truly . Ooh , try the Camembert . Try it . It 's divine . We offered them what little comfort we could , of course . POTTINGER : We , um , shared their provisions and ... Of course . Yeah . That 's right . Thanks , Paul . Many of the refugees joined us as we headed north up to Arrowhead to resupply . Well , I mean , obviously you made it here . But what happened to everyone else ? We hit raiders outside Detroit . I escaped , but Mercado and the others , they weren 't so lucky . - Doubt it was luck . - Nolan . Come on . I want to hear this . I made my way here to Arrowhead alone . Found the entrance , but I didn 't know the passcode . I would have died from the elements had it not been for an angel who came to my rescue . An angel named George . I 'm not really an angel . POTTINGER : That 's a matter of opinion . George here brought me inside , and he and his fellow Bio-men kept Station Arrowhead humming along since the Pale Wars ended . POTTINGER : It 's a remarkable place . It 's completely self-sustaining . It was built it as a refuge for the government elite in case the world went to hell . There 's a fully stocked seed vault , functional rain chamber . There 's even DNA samples of old-world animals . Cows and goats and cats and dogs . I had a dog once . He only had three legs . I know , Georgie , I know . But he 's in a much better place now , isn 't he ? Hmm . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) This is the last of the stuff . ( GROANS IN PAIN ) Guilty conscience eating at you ? It 's a headache . It 's nothing . Look at this . So ? It 's just part of a boom box . The Arch was full of old radio junk . Look at these burns . And how the edges are blown out from the inside . This radio was the casing for the bomb . Let 's see if we can get a print off it . ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS ) So it 's just you here . Underground . With your four color-coordinated Bio-men . Your own little slice of heaven , if you ask me . Nolan 's sarcasm notwithstanding , yes , I have built quite the pleasant life for myself . I read . I write . I farm . I 've even been known to dabble in carpentry from time to time . ( LAUGHS AND COUGHS ) POTTINGER : You all right ? ( COUGHS ) Mmm . ( COUGHS ) Look , I 'm glad you 're happy . I appreciate that , Amanda , I do . I 've missed you . I 've missed you an awful lot . ( CHUCKLES ) Well ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) ... before I start blubbing all over myself , let 's get to it . I can 't imagine this is a social visit . What do you need ? Food ? Building materials ? Guns . Since the E-Rep fell apart , the Votanis Collective has been growing in strength . They blew up the Arch . Good Lord . It 's gone completely ? Yes . I can imagine how deeply it affects you , Amanda . Why did you let me prattle on about myself so much ? You were kind of on a roll . ( LAUGHS ) I 'm afraid I do still rather enjoy the sound of my own voice . Your request is granted . Ringo . Show our friends to the armory , yeah ? Let them take as many weapons as they can fit into their roller . All right , then . Niles , I can 't thank you enough . My pleasure . Oh , Amanda . Amanda ? Could I have a word in private ? I 'm fine . Go . Nolan doesn 't trust me . NOLAN : I don 't trust anyone . Do you want to blow this ? - I 'm not leaving you ... - I can handle him . I mean it . Go . I 'll be back in 10 minutes . Very good . ( MUSIC PLAYS ) Is this a conversation or a seduction ? Hopefully both . I 've been thinking about six months ago , when I left Defiance for New York . How you refused to join me . You know I care about you . I just ... No , no , no . It 's all right . I completely understand . There were so many distractions . Protecting Defiance , rebuilding the E-Rep , fighting the V.C ... This period of solitude has clarified certain primal sanities . You and I are special . We 're bound together in a deep and fundamental manner . But Eve could not truly join her Adam until the perfect Eden revealed itself . And now it has . Amanda , what would you say to the idea of staying on here Permanently ? ( EXHALES ) Are we getting the band back together ? ( GROANS ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) I didn 't mean to intrude . Surprising an Omec is a dangerous pursuit . Forgive me . I came for your culture lessons . We never specified a time . ( CHUCKLES ) And that , I think , is a lie . ( LAUGHS ) Partially . Yes . My husband is in a mood , and I was anxious for some more pleasant company . Something to take my mind off the Arch . The Gateway Arch is a human monument . Why should a Shanje such as yourself care about its destruction ? ( SIGHS ) My son , Alak , ran the radio station from the top of the arch . It meant more to him than anything else . I see . Would you care for something to drink ? Hmm . Haven 't you done enough for Defiance ? I can 't hide underground and watch my town burn . You know that . We 're meant to be together . Yeah ? I belong to you . And you belong to me . Amanda , you 're mine . What ? " You 're mine . " That 's what my attacker said in New York before he ... I 'm so sorry . Of course . Of course , you told me all about that night . I 'm so sorry . Okay . It was just , it was an unfortunate choice of words . No , no , no . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You think you 're over something , and then it just comes back at you in unexpected ways . Uh ... Do you have any Scotch ? Real Scotch . That 's bourbon . I checked earlier . Of course you did . I 'll be right back . ( GASPS ) So you have no idea whether your son is alive or not . I can only pray to Rayetso for his safe return . I , too , am no stranger to loss of family . I am sorry . I have learned to find solace in our great works . The most enduring are about finding meaning in loss . I 've spent many long nights on my ship considering what the Indogene had done to us . I could not help but wonder if we had not brought tragedy upon ourselves . Death breeds death . Hmm . The greatest Omec opera was about that very thing . ( CHUCKLES ) " Harvest Nocturne . " Yes . ( LAUGHS ) It 's my favorite . ( HUMS ) ( BOTH HUM TOGETHER ) ( GIGGLES ) Why have you really come here , my lovely little show-off ? I want the truth . The entire truth . Isn 't it obvious ? I wish to be enchanted . ( HUMMED SONG PLAYS ) ( STAHMA PANTS AND MOANS ) ( BOTH PANTING ) ( MOANING ) ( PANTING ) ( MOANS ) ( GROWLS ) ( MOANS ) ( GROWLS ) ( MOANS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( MOANS ) ( GROWLS ) ( MOANS ) ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) Would you like to go again ? ( GIGGLES ) ( GASPS ) ( SIGHS ) You took a nice shot there . Turn your head to the light so I can check your pupils . Do you know your name ? Yeah , Joshua Nolan . Good . I 'm Samir . Do you remember what happened to you ? ( NOLAN SIGHS ) Bio-man took a cheap shot . You a medic ? I was a veterinarian before New York got destroyed . But now I work on humans and Sensoths , and everything in between . ( GROANS ) Any nausea ? No , no . I 'm fine . Hard head . Yeah , that cut on your head . How did you get that ? Long , complicated story . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Uh ... Yeah , that 's locked , by the way . ( SIGHS ) How many Bio-men on site ? Just the Fab Four . Yeah ? You got people with you ? Used to . Thirty of us , from New York . We managed to escape after the Great Terraforming Disaster . Um , after a few months , we met up with Pottinger 's soldiers on the road I mean , E-Rep . We thought they 'd keep us safe . Until Pottinger just went nuts . I mean , he put a bullet through his commanding officer 's head and then declared himself in charge . Some of us tried to stop him . People died . After that , Pottinger knew that none of us trusted him . Soto keep people in line , he forced me to wire a dead man 's switch to his chest . You 're shitting me . If Pottinger 's heart stops beating , it triggers a bomb . What kind of a bomb ? Uh , you remember Portland ? Yeah . I 've seen the crater . He wired himself to a singularity bomb ? Yeah . If he dies , this whole place gets sucked into a wormhole . We gotta get outta here now . Put that down . Where 's Nolan ? In the armory . Can you take me to him ? No . George , why is that door padlocked ? It 's private . ( SIGHS ) In the elevator , you said I reminded you of " the girl in the movies . " Who is she ? What did you mean ? Thank you , George , that 'll be all . I should stay . I think she might try to hurt you . Oh ... I don 't think she 's happy here . You 're very perceptive , George . Your Boss said something to me that reminded me of a bad thing that happened . So , yes , I 'm not happy . But it 's nothing an old-world single malt can 't fix . I can wait outside the doors . What is he ? A Bio-man or a jealous girlfriend ? Go see to the dishes , George . I shan 't ask you again . Okay . Rather like a Labrador , isn 't he ? ( CHUCKLES ) Mmm . So I 've been thinking about your offer . I 'm willing to stay , but there 's a price . Go on . I 'll do anything to keep Defiance safe . You offered us a roller filled with weapons , but that 's not nearly enough . I propose we send Nolan back with the weapons , he returns with a caravan to haul everything back to Defiance . Everything ? ( LAUGHS ) Every single weapon in your armory , down to the last firecracker . Defiance gets the guns , and you get me . All right , jackass . Open the door . The screening room . Now . Amanda , please . Open it , or I open you . All right , all right . There 's something you must know about me first . I 'm not well . The abuse I suffered when I was attacked by Votans at my boarding school ... Shut up . Move . Okay . Okay . How do you like it ? My special place . ( DOOR CLOSES ) AMANDA : What is all this stuff ? This mask . This flashlight . Now listen to me carefully . When I love someone , I become completely and utterly enthralled with them . Their tragedies . Everything . What 's on these video chips ? POTTINGER : Just all the video diaries of ... Play this one . With my name on it . Now ! Play it ! Now ! Okay . ( BREATHES DEEPLY AND SIGHS ) There . ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( BREATH TREMBLING ) Such ethereal beauty . ( SOBS ) I can 't believe I didn 't see this . Before me , it was Connor . Yeah . We were school chums . He protected me when the Votan attacked . He saved me . I loved him . And then what ? Then you followed him to New York ? Hmm . Yes . But Connor didn 't want to see me , so sometimes I would follow people who were close to him . Somebody might lead me to him . Like that night in Central Park ? When I was attacked . Yeah . Yeah . I saw what happened . And I wanted to stop it , okay ? But I froze . I was a coward . But after your attacker left , I wanted to help you . But how could I justify being there , Amanda ? In that moment , all my guilt , all my shame , my self-hatred , it just exploded into rage . But I chased after your attacker , and I caught him , and I bashed in his skull , and I rolled his body into the river . For you . And yet you kept his mask and flashlight ? They 're replicas ! AMANDA : Replicas ? Bullshit . Come on , Amanda . Please , put down the gun . That 's it . Listen to me . Look . If you had shot me , the entire station would 've exploded . Ahhh ! ( GRUNTS ) ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Looks like we 're all still here . ( GRUNTS ) Let 's move . Right behind you . You 're not supposed to open the door . ( GRUNTS ) Okay . He 's , uh , really new here . He doesn 't know ... ( RINGO GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) Oh ! ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( METAL CLANGS ) ( RINGO GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) ( GROANS ) Ahhh ! ( GROANING IN PAIN ) ( GRUNTS ) ( NOLAN GROANS IN PAIN ) ( RINGO GROANS ) Ahhh ! ( NOLAN GROANS IN PAIN ) ( RINGO GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) ( RINGO GROANS ) ( STRUGGLING ) ( GROWLS ) Nice thinking , doggie doctor . ( SIGHS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GUNSHOT ) Amanda . Come on ! Please stop . If you kill me , we will all die . I want to hear you say it . Admit what you did . Say it ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Please , Amanda , don 't do this . ( GRUNTS ) Ow ! Say it . ( GROANS ) Ahhh ! Say it . ( PANTING ) I love you . Say it ! Ahhh ! ( GROANS ) Ow ! Say it . ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTING ) Amanda , no ! Samir ! I 'm on it . Keep him alive . Don 't let him die . Come on . NOLAN : Hey . Hey . He raped me . Come on . No , no . No , no , no . It was him . ( SIGHS ) ( STEADY BEEP ) ( ALARM BLARING ) He 's dead . We gotta get outta here . Come on . Amanda , come on ! We gotta go . Come on ! ( MACHINE POWERING UP ) NOLAN : Faster ! Faster ! Come on . Pretty . T 'EVGIN : Ah ! You 're awake . I made some pancakes . I got the ingredients from the NeedWant bazaar . Oh . Thank you . - I hope you like them . - Oh . ( LAUGHS ) Hmm . ( GIGGLES ) Enjoy them while they 're hot . Oh ... Your needle . I suppose we should discuss the poison . Poison ? You 're not the first Castithan concubine that has attempted to murder me . Your people know nothing about my physiology . And that 's exactly the way I like it . I have lived for many , many centuries . And the longer my people live , the more difficult we are to kill . So , why do you want me dead ? Actually , I don 't . And I don 't want to be killed , so I guess that puts us on the same page , as the humans say . So , why the poison ? I lied earlier . I know exactly where my son is . The Votanis Collective have taken him hostage . They ordered me to kill you , or his life would be forfeit . What will you tell them ? The truth . I have failed . Will you try again ? Do I have any chance of success ? ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm afraid not . What shall you do ? In my entire life , no man has ever made a meal for me . I feel I should thank you . ( T 'EVGIN LAUGHS ) ( LAUGHS ) You know whose badge that is . Of course I do . I miss him , too . I loved Tommy . Shut up ! You don 't kill what you love ! ( GASPS ) It wasn 't me . It was the machine . ( BREATH TREMBLING ) Is it a machine holding a knife to my neck right now ? ( GROANS ) Ahhh ! Ahhh ! ( PANTS ) Ah ! ( GROANS ) ( PANTING ) What the chup ? Nolan , I 'm so sorry . Don 't . If I hadn 't killed Pottinger , we would have those weapons to fight the V.C. Yeah . Possible . Also possible that killing Pottinger saved us from being murdered by Bio-men , or , in your case , something much worse . What 's that for ? For being one of the good guys . ( GRUNTS ) Ah ! Nolan ? Nolan ! ( GRUNTS ) Nolan ! He 's bleeding . Get me a stick . AMANDA : Uh ... ( PANTS ) ( GRUNTS ) Here . ( GRUNTS ) SAMIR : The blood 's coming from his head wound . What caused it ? Some kind of Votan tech . More specific ! I don 't know ! You need to make an educated guess . Because whatever 's inside this man 's head is killing him . ( GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) Ah ! Ah ! What 's wrong with you ? Ah ! Ah ! ( PANTS ) Help me . ( PANTING ) Please . ( PANTING ) Ripped By mstoll

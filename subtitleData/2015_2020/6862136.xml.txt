 [ Shiro ] Let 's hurry up with these repairs . Zarkon could be here at any moment . Okay , panel 's off . Now , what ? Very simple . Just loosen the blaxums on the somoflange . Could you be more specific ? [ Allura ] Sorry , Hunk , he means the poklones on the agroclams . - No , that doesn 't help . - Easy , Hunk . I got this . [ whirring , alarm blaring ] Uh-oh . That can 't be good . - No , not the smalters , the poklones ! - No , no ! It 's the blaxums ! What are you talking about ? - There . Fixed . - [ Allura ] Well done , Pidge ! The tech on this ship never ceases to amaze me . It 's so mathematically elegant . Its fit is a 100 times more frictionless than any exoskeleton we have on Earth . - It 's ... beautiful . - It 's not a sunset , Pidge . You 're right . A billion sunsets just happen every day . Some genius engineer actually built this . Kinda looks like a big , delicious curly fry . [ groans ] What the ... ? All right , we 're prepared for this . Remember your rogue projectile cluster training from the Garrison . First , we need a temporary shelter . [ grunts ] Wha- - ? Oh , sorry , Shiro . I was trying to hit Keith . [ growls ] [ chuckles ] Like that ? Yes ! Squishy asteroid fight ! [ all grunting , yelling ] [ Shiro ] All right , guys . Oh , oh ! Okay , now , it 's on ! - [ laughing ] - Hmm ... - [ Lance ] Oh , come on ! - I don 't think these are asteroids . Coran , I 'm going to need a containment unit . [ Coran ] Just a tick . They appear to be some sort of hyper-resilient spore . [ Pidge ] This bioluminescent pulsing doesn 't seem natural . It appears programmed . I think it 's a code . - A code ? From who ? [ grunts ] - I don 't know . I mean , it makes no sense . You can 't program a spore . If anyone can figure it out , it 's you , Pidge . [ Allura ] Before that , everyone needs to come in for decontamination . - [ Hunk ] Ah ... - [ Pidge yelping ] - [ Hunk laughing ] - [ Lance growling ] [ screaming ] - [ footsteps approaching ] - [ door beeping ] Keith , did you happen to see a mouse come through here ? He has something of mine . Uh ... no . - I 'll find you , Platt . - Wait , Coran ! Do you think the Galra ever went to Earth ? Is that possible ? They would have taken it over , right ? Oh , I think you 'd know if the Galra were there . The Blue Lion was there . Did a Galra pilot the Blue Lion , too ? Hey , why are you asking about my lion ? How many lions do you need ? - What ? No , I-I was just- - - Don 't " What ? No , I-I was just- - " me ! You 've had your eye on the Blue Lion from day one ! Well , yeah . It 's the first one we found- - Ah ! Bah-bah-bah-bah ! The Blue Lion 's with me and we 're very happy together ! Very happy ! [ Pidge ] Guys ! Check this out ! [ electronic beeping ] Oh , oh ! I 've seen this experiment . But , question : Why do we need to get electricity from a potato ? What ? No , no . I was able to crack the " sporse code . " [ chuckles ] I ran the bioluminescent pattern through a variety of code-breaking sequences , including this homemade virtual Turing machine . Of course , I had to make a few tweaks to the original design , because , obviously , there have been several advancements since he designed it . Although , you have to admit , Turing was a shining light in the world of science - in an age when far too many were still- - - Pidge . - [ yelps ] - What does it say ? Oh , yeah . " Under attack . Galra . Help . " And then , there are coordinates . It 's a distress signal . Good work , Pidge . Get those coordinates into the castle-ship 's navigation system . [ Coran ] The signal came from Olkarion , home to the Olkari , a proud class of engineers , builders of vast cities that could change shape at the whim of their creators . [ Allura ] They had a seemingly magical ability to manipulate solid metal . With just a wave of their hands , they could build a computer inside a block of steel . - Whoa . - An Olkari once gave me this ! - What is it ? - Uh , hello ? It 's a floating cube ! [ laughs ] Oh , this guy . And watch ! My name is Coran and I 'm a gorgeous man . [ beeping ] [ Coran 's voice ] My name is Coran and I 'm a gorgeous man . Why would a society full of literal tech wizards use spores to send a distress signal ? Who cares ? When do we get to see that city ? Actually , Pidge , the distress signal isn 't coming from the city . It 's coming from ... the forest . [ gasps ] Oh ... Why doesn 't anyone ever send a distress signal from a cool place ? [ Pidge ] I hate the outdoors . Nothing but sunburn and poison oak . I like it out here . It 's quiet . [ gasps ] - What was that ? - Uh , are we being attacked ? I don 't know , but something 's dragging my lion down to the surface . [ Lance ] Yeah , something 's pulling Blue down , too . Are those wooden mech suits ? Are you kidding me ? We got taken down by a bunch of tree people ! [ Shiro over speaker ] We come in peace ! Could it be ? Voltron ? We found your distress signal ! - Praise Lubos ! - [ Olkari ] Lubos ! [ cheering , chanting ] Lubos ! When the Galra attacked , only a few of us escaped the cities . We were forced to flee into the forest . - How long have you lived like this ? - Many decafeebs . But , as you can see , our people are resilient . We never stopped evolving . Instead , we adapted our skills to the environment . [ panting ] Coran was right , Ryner . You really are the most incredible engineers in the universe . To be able to switch from working with precision machinery to a bunch of sticks ! Nature 's designs are superior to any that we could devise . No offense , but I 'll take my computer over a tree any day . You two can talk science later . Let 's assemble Voltron and get rid of these Galra invaders . It 's not that simple , I 'm afraid . The Galra have our leader , Lubos . [ Olkari ] Lubos ... If you attack , who knows what they 'll do to him ? Then , we 'll just have to rescue him . - [ over speaker ] Work faster ! Faster ! - [ Olkari grunting ] For a bunch of slaves with magical , metalworking powers , they 're taking an awfully long time to build my super weapon . Perhaps they need a little bit of motivation . Show them their king ! No ... No more ! Please don 't hurt me ! - [ gasping ] - [ sobbing ] That 's more like it . Um ... Ryner , where are we ? This is the armory . Whoa ... - [ all scream , gasp ] - [ Hunk ] Huh ? - Cool ! - Uh , can I get one of those ? [ Ryner ] Of course . You can each have one . Now , the key to operating it is understanding that the nanocellulose responds to electrical impulses from the neural pathways connected through this . - Do what now ? - Mm . Mm ! Makes my tongue itchy . That 's your interface ? Of course , all commands need to come as binary coded messages . So , like this . - Yes ! Excellent ! - I think mine is just a tree . You must have a deep connection with nature . Not really . My allergies and pale skin don 't mix with outdoor living . - Pidge is our resident tech expert . - Well , that explains it . Like the Olkari , you understand that , at the deepest level , trees , metal , you , me ... we 're all made up of the same cosmic dust , all arranged by the laws of mathematics . Does this mean I should start gardening ? It means you 're going to need to give your friends a ride . This way ! To the edge of the forest ! To save our king ! Finally , the cube is ready for launch . Load the top Olkari engineers onto our ships and prepare for departure . After the cube destroys Olkarion , hopefully , Zarkon will welcome us back to the main fleet . [ Ryner ] Their headquarters are impenetrable from the ground , but there is one way in , a small opening in the roof . It goes all the way down to an open courtyard . That 's quite a drop . But there you will have total access to the building . The hard part will be getting onto the roof undetected . [ Shiro ] That won 't be a problem . Hey , hey , what 's that ? Is that part of the building ? My Lubos ! It can 't be ! Hey ! That looks like the cube Coran gave me ! I haven 't seen one of those in many decafeebs . We used to play with them as children . But this ... Only King Lubos could have designed one that size . Why would he do that ? They must have forced him to reveal his designs and reconstruct it as a weapon . From the looks of it , I 'd say it 's almost finished . Okay , we need to act fast . Everyone , back to base . I have a plan . First , we 'll need to get to the top of that tower . Since the Green Lion has stealth capabilities , Pidge , you 're the drop ship . You 'll take Keith , Hunk , Lance , and me to the roof , then drop back to a safe position . After the drop , we 'll use a censor to scan the building for any Olkari biorhythms . [ rapid beeping ] [ moaning , sobbing inside ] [ sobbing continues ] [ sobbing continues ] [ Lubos ] Betrayal ! [ sobbing ] She loves you ! [ sobbing ] King Lubos ? Yes ? Who are you ? The jesters I requested ? Um , we 're here to , like , rescue you ? Hmm ... [ alarm blaring ] You could have just said , " No , thanks . " Looks like someone came to rescue you , Lubos . You turned your back on your people to save your own skin ? I 'm doing this for my people ! They wanted to fight the Galra , but they are too powerful ! The Galra could destroy us ! So , you helped enslave your people to build some super weapon ? Don 't make me the bad guy ! He forced me to do it ! Did he force-feed you , too ? Uh ... You 're no king . [ whimpers , groans ] Okay , we 're walking out of here ! Anyone tries to stop us and Lubos gets it ! - Whoa , K-Keith ! - That came out of nowhere ! La-sai , what are you doing ? You betrayed our people . I can 't live this lie anymore . You don 't want me to hurt your genius engineer , right ? Oh , be my guest . His work is done . The cube is complete . What ? But-But I thought we had a deal ! Guards , put them all out of their misery . [ all scream ] [ grunting , coughing ] [ Pidge ] Your ride is here ! Engage the cube ! Take down the lion ! [ all panting ] [ both grunt ] [ Shiro ] The cube is operational ! We 've got to get back to the other lions and form Voltron ! [ Pidge ] On it ! - [ groans ] - [ Olkari gasp ] [ Olkari murmuring ] Lubos ... What 's going on ? While your countrymen starved , King Lubos was well taken care of by the Galra . He willingly helped them build that cube , willingly helped to enslave his own people . - [ all gasp ] - Lubos ... I know you 're devastated , but it 's time to be strong and use your Olkari spirit to fight alongside Voltron and take back your planet ! Lubos , how could you ? - I ... I was only trying to- - - Enough ! We must free our people ! [ Olkari cheering ] [ roars ] [ roars ] [ Shiro ] All right , team , let 's take that thing down ! Form shield ! Let 's see how tough this magic cube is . Did it just absorb our lasers ? We need to increase firepower ! Hunk , use your blaster ! - I 'm not sure this is a good idea . - Got it ! Yeah , I think it 's working ! It 's giving back whatever we fire into it , like Coran 's echo cube . That 's what I was trying to tell you guys ! It 's learning ! Making its own versions of our weapons to use against us ! [ Lance ] We can 't just sit here . We 've got to move ! [ all scream ] [ Hunk ] How do we beat it ? Maybe , if we form our sword , we can cut through the surface and hack right into the center thinking point place ? Can 't be any worse than what 's happening now . Let 's do it . Form sword ! [ Pidge ] It 's working ! It 's still operational ! Re-engage ! [ Hunk ] We did it ! They 're going down ! [ Lance ] Uh-oh ! [ Shiro ] We 've got to move ! Move ! [ grunts ] We can 't fight them like this ! We need to split up ! Back into lions ! Excellent . Voltron doesn 't stand a chance against my weapon . Soon , I 'll have both the cube and Voltron to present to Emperor Zarkon . Let 's see if I can freeze these guys ! Oh , no ! So cold , so cold ! - Oh , oh . Thanks , Keith . - You got it . Shiro , what are we going to do ? There doesn 't seem to be any way to stop them , but we can 't let this weapon get into Zarkon 's hands ! - [ screams ] - Pidge ! The Green Lion 's in trouble ! [ Hunk ] Pidge ! Are you okay ? [ groaning ] - [ Ryner ] Pidge , can you hear me ? - Yeah . Wait . - How am I hearing you ? - That 's not important right now . We need to get your lion back up and running . I think we can heal your lion 's body , but you must bond with its spirit if it is to fly again . - But I thought we bonded already . - Your bond must be stronger . Come on , girl . I need you . Remember what I said . You , the lion , the Olkari ... We are all made of the same essence . [ Shiro ] Where are you , Pidge ? We need you ! - [ all groaning , grunting ] - [ Keith ] Pidge ! - [ groaning continues ] - Pidge ! - Guys , hang on ! - [ all ] Pidge ! [ Hunk ] Whoa , Pidge ! What 's going on ? You 're booking ! I 'm not sure , but I feel more connected with my lion than ever ! I know what I have to do ! [ roars ] Whoa ! How 'd you do that ? That 's right ! Circle up , everybody ! Get some of this ! [ chuckles ] Vines ... Well , that is not the way I thought a giant cube of death would go down . No ! Commander , we have to evacuate . The cube is down , and the Olkari have taken back the city . [ growls ] [ all cheering ] I want to thank you all . You helped us get our home back . And , for that , we will never be able to repay you . Just promise me that when it 's time to take the fight to Zarkon , we can count on the Olkari for help . Now and forever . And you ... The spirit of the Olkari resides in you . The bond between you and your lion has grown stronger than ever . Without you , I would never have been able to unlock my lion 's hidden power . - [ Shiro ] Nice job , Pidge . - You know , it 's weird . I 've always been a tech junkie . That 's how I connected with the world . But , for the first time , I feel connected to everything . I guess it 's like Ryner said . We 're all made up of the same cosmic dust . So , that means we 're all related . This ship , those stars , the Olkari . Even the Galra . Uh-oh . I think Keith just blew his own mind . - [ all laugh ] - [ Hunk ] What ? Well , that was a productive trip . Look at all these cubes they gave me ! - Coran , Coran , the gorgeous man ! - Coran , Coran , the gorgeous man ! - Ah , sounds pretty good . - Ah , sounds pretty good . [ makes fart noise ] [ fart noise echoing ] - [ all laughing , gasping ] - [ Hunk ] Whoa ! - [ Coran ] What 's that ? - What 's that ? - Oh , no ! - Oh , no !

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Call the Director . We struck out again . They won 't give up on you , especially Coulson . It 's not just the Watchdogs now . Local gangs have been working for them . I was tracing the sale of a weapon . A breath of fresh air . And I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer . Everyone 's attached to something . You actually trust this guy ? I don 't trust the new Director , but he trusts me . The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q. It 's been a long time since we had a moment alone . - You okay ? - Yeah . Just a long day . 4x02 - " Meet the New Boss " Dad ! Dad ! Hey . Buddy , what are you doing up ? There was a ghost in there . There was ? Friendly or not friendly ? - Not friendly . - Yeah ? Well ... it seems like he 's gone now . She . It was a girl . Okay . Still , bed . Dad , don 't ! What are you doing in my house ? Oh , my God ! Who the hell are you ? Joseph ! - Joe , come here ! Hurry ! - There 's no Joe . We lived here for years . This is our house . Dad , I 'm scared . No . No . No . No ! Jefe , no way , no . The ball touched the ground . You could see it . No , no , no , no , no , no . Listen , Robbie will settle this . Hey , Reyes , did you see the game last night ? - Oh , missed it . I was out . - Out ? - Oh , I know your code , man . - Oh , you do , huh ? Sure . I was young once . - Did you at least get her name ? - Oh-ho . - Nah , it wasn 't like that . - Oh , man . We wait this long for a team to come into town , and you don 't even watch . If it ain 't silver and black , I don 't really give a damn . Silver and black ... As we have discussed , it appears to be a simple empty box . Yes , one lined with a rare alloy and emitting energy readings off the charts that drove six men insane , but yeah . - Simple empty box . - Right . Well ... Y-You joked about how it would be less of a puzzle if Schrodinger 's cat were in there . Hilarious . Thanks very much . But did get me thinking . What if there is something in there in an unobservable quantum state ? - Out of phase with visible light ? - Exactly . So , by using light outside of the visible spectrum and reversing the phase , we get this . Cue Jemma gasping . - Oh , my Lord . It 's beautiful . - It 's indescribable . Scientifically . I 've never seen technology like this . Feel like a Dark Ages blacksmith looking at a Tesla . Alien ? Crystal-like structure , wrapping on itself , or a containment field , maybe , but containing what ? I think I know . A family turned up at the local ER this morning . And the father ... well , he had the same signs of dementia as our gangster friends over there . - Near Los Angeles ? - Yeah . Now , he said that , uh , there was a ghost in the house and it walked through him . So he 's suffering from the hallucinations , as well . Well , that 's what I thought . But as I started going through the footage ... There . Maybe he wasn 't hallucinating . We 've been waiting an hour . I can read a clock , too . His assistant said he 's held up in a meeting . Look at this . Maybe they 're discussing new ways to implement bureaucracy . He 's making you wait just to remind you he can . He 's pissed . We went after Daisy without clearing it . I 've been in his shoes before . Doesn 't mean he 'll go easy on you . I don 't need him to go easy . I 'll own what I did , make my apologies , then head out on our next deployment . - You 're going right back out ? - Not a moment too soon . All this ... the meetings , the waiting ... I do not miss that part of the job . It 'd still be your job if you put up half a fight . This room ... does it seem ... ? Like it was decorated by someone who needs to unclench ? Yeah , the Zephyr 's feeling more and more like home . In-flight meals could be better , but it 's mine . At least they can 't take that away . Okay , Mrs. Serrano . Just sign here . Thanks . Just , uh , take this into the office . - You can pay inside . - Okay . Oh , my God . I never even thought of that . You must find so much weird stuff in people 's cars . Now I 'm racking my brain , wondering what I 've left in mine . Ah . Oh , hey , Robbie . So , this girl is telling me ... Robbie Reyes . Wow . You look so different from the last time I laid eyes on you . - Long time no see . - Yeah , it 's been a minute . I was just telling Canelo here how tight we used to be back at Garfield High . - The stories I could tell ... - What are you doing here ? I 'm having trouble with my van . Yesterday , out of nowhere , it just burst into flames . And I hear you 're sort of an expert at that kind of thing , so I figured it was time for us to reconnect . I don 't know . Looks fine to me . The engine caught fire . How is that not a dangerous problem ? Maybe you should leave it alone . So you don 't get hurt . Or smoked . You claim your victims earn that . Hard to verify all of them . - Somehow , you tracked me down . - Just to talk . I figured you 're either on the right side of things or ... Or what ? Or else ? You 're out of your mind coming here . You may know who I am , but you don 't know me or what I 'm capable of . It 's funny you should mention that . I was just thinking of how many memories I have of you , Reyes . Not this " too cool for school " version you 've got going on now , but ... the real you . He wasn 't always the , uh , strong silent type ? Well , I 've known him since Crandall Elementary . He was always quiet , like he was hiding something . The two of us used to hit up the Moonraker Arcade down in Little Tokyo . Isn 't that right , Robbie ? Yes , it is , so I 've seen a side of him that most people haven 't . We used to hang there every day till your uncle would pick you up . How 's he doing these days ? You get lost ... or I 'll get angry . So angry , I may not remember what I do to you . - Sometimes , I prefer it that way . - In front of them ? It 's just a hose loose . You 're all good . Oh , no . Look at that . Looks like we 'll be here for a little bit longer . - Only two hours late . - Let 's just get this over with . Move . - He doesn 't appear to be moving . - Director , they 're here . - Send them in . - Yes , sir . It 's good . I just think that that should be the headline if that 's the sidebar . Right , would you take a note of that ? Phillip ! - Jeffrey . - Agent May . Thanks for waiting . Seems like this job requires you to be an hour behind like all the time . - Or two . - But you already know that . Right , Phil ? Glad you 're here . Let 's get down to business . Guys , can we have the room for a minute , please ? - Cecilio , go get yourself a coffee . - Yes , sir . Look , I get you 're disappointed there was a mission to find Agent Johnson without your authorization , - but we had intel that suggested ... - Phil , it 's okay . She was your friend . Loyalty 's a good thing . But I had a whole speech ready . Sure it 's good . Use it next time . But today , you impressed me . You 're impressed ? Really ? Yeah . I try to live by a simple rule ... a team that trusts is a team that triumphs . Right ? I mean , you get that . You ... You get how I think . Then why do I still feel like there 's a " but " coming ? And trust is important , especially now . Ah . Not a " but , " an " and . " And Daisy 's a problem because you need the public 's trust , given that you 're about to unveil S.H.I.E.L.D. as a legitimate agency again . We 're preparing for an official announcement , yes . So it 's kind of a bad time for a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent - to be robbing banks . - She would never get in the way . Hey , I 'm only talking PR here . And I 'm sure you don 't like hearing about optics , especially since Agent Johnson was your friend . " Optics " ? The way things look , the package we present . I know what it means . It just seems trivial . Try to understand that this is a very delicate stage . Public opinion matters a great deal . Without it , everything falls apart . And I don 't want your friend responsible for destroying everything that you have worked so hard to rebuild here . It won 't come to that . There 's an issue I 'd like to discuss with Agent Coulson alone . Could you give us a minute ? And , Agent May ... I can tell you 're the one to keep an eye on . Melinda May . - Now , there 's a riddle I 'd like to solve . - Good luck with that . Phil ... I got a special assignment for you . Wait , wait , wait . So , this woman caused a disturbance in Chen and his people with a touch ? Yeah , it seems there 's something to do with physical contact , but how is she incorporeal ? Maybe a multidimensional event caused it . - Like Tobias Ford . - Yeah ? Or perhaps a matter-energy phase shift . You know , if the box is utilizing phase shifting ... Ma-Maybe she 's just a ghost . That 's also a theory . Look , the alloy in the box itself is very rare . It 's only made at Momentum Labs in three locations around the world . Or was . All three have been shut down for years . Yeah , so you 've got New York , Pasadena ... Pasadena , California . Hold on . Yeah . The family that checked in to the ER ? They live in Pasadena . I 'll requisition a Quinjet for us . Yeah , I 'll come , too . Simmons can 't . I 'm stuck . Assignment for the Director . - Seriously ? - Oh , you know , " a team that trusts is a team that triumphs . " - W-What 's he got you doing ? - Oh , well , that 's the best bit . " My expertise is needed here for a tour . " - A what ? - It 'll be fun . It 's not my job anymore , Jeffrey . And wouldn 't my time be better spent in the field - instead of ... - Instead of walking some overly pampered U.S. Congress people around your private base ? Maybe . You love this stuff . History , SSR trivia ... that 's where you shine . You 're just complimenting me so I 'll do this . I 'm complimenting you because it 's true . Look , you 're the expert on all things S.H.I.E.L.D. , not me . And ... we both know why I have this job . But what I don 't have is the anonymous , unlimited funding you seemed to have before . To build billion-dollar airplanes ? No . Our budget hinges on the U.N. and the Sokovia Accords and on impressing the House Appropriations Committee . I can 't do that myself . Please . Hugo . What happened ? God , Lucy , look at you . What did he do ? - Hugo ... - What ? Oh , my God . No . - Where are the others ? - Trapped in these cells , like us . Now , I know this is confusing , but I need you to focus . Focus ? Look at us . What did he do to us ? He has to pay . We have to find him . We could 've been in there for hours . Hugo ... we have been in there for years . What do you want ? I looked into your kills . Some of them check out . - I told you . It 's vengeance . - Vengeance . Right . Well , " vengeance " seems to put you on the same track as me . - So tell me what you know . - Look , detective ... they got what they deserved . End of story . All right . Now I 'll tell you what I know . There 's a group called the Watchdogs . They 're hunting people like us . - " Us " ? - Inhumans . That 's not what I am . Look , I ... I know what you 're going through . I 've been there , and I know that it 's hard to understand , - but killing people is not ... - You 're here to counsel me ? You want to save my soul ? - I 'm telling you , girl , I sold mine . - To the devil ? He was the only one buying , you know ? Look , I 'm done talking . You want to throw down again , we could do that . I like my chances . You want to turn me in ? Try it . I 've got nothing to lose . You may not , but Gabe might be a little sad to lose his big brother . You 're all he 's got . Robbie ! Listen , I got to take the truck , drop off a GTO in Palm Desert . Take all the time you need . I 'll lock up . Andale . Mañana . Now , you ? You shouldn 't have mentioned my brother . - Doesn 't have to go this way . - You 're wrong . Ah ! Come on . Piper . Get the squad ready . Training in 10 . - Yes , ma 'am . - " Ma 'am " ? Is there a different title you 'd prefer ? - Commander ? Sir ? - Let 's just stick to " May . " I can do May . I can do that , May . Agent Carter herself didn 't know it all . Oh , but this guy ? This guy 's our real expert . - He actually does know it all . - I know some SSR history . - It 's not a big deal . - No , no , no , no . He 's being modest . Not only does he keep this place running , I bet he could tell us the exact year it was built . 1949 . - Told you . - Uh , one interesting fact ... Peggy Carter herself oversaw construction of this base . Most people know the legend of Peggy Carter , but there 's so many stories that were never recorded . I remember one time ... You 're seeing their faces , aren 't you ? Everyone else ... what 's wrong with them ? - Why don 't they see it ? - I do . - How do I help them ? - You can 't . - It 's everywhere . - There has to be a way for me to ... It 's everywhere ! It 's everywhere ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! - Everywhere ! - What the hell is happening ? Everywhere ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! He 'll nap for an hour . May , what happened ? Did you say something that made him ... ? Shame Simmons couldn 't come with us . Seems the new parameters at HQ come with nothing but more paperwork . Yeah , you 're telling me . Inventory before deployment ? I mean , this is a-a lot of numbers . I 'm a mechanic , not an accountant . You 're an engineer , Mack . And a small tank . I can 't tell if some of our medication supply is missing or ... I 'm just too fried to figure it out . You are looking a bit more feeble than usual . Thank you for that . It 's these long deployments , Turbo . Weeks at a time . I mean , Coulson loves it , but the isolation gets to me . Have you been seeing Yo-Yo ? Yeah . Yeah , we Skype occasionally . Well , at least you 're not on the wild goose chase - for Daisy anymore . - We tried , man . - I promise you . - Yeah , I know . Should be landing in about an hour . - All those years ... - My wife ... she 's out there . - My life ... - Calm down . I don 't have time to be calm . What that backstabber did to us ... It wasn 't just him . It was you . - We trusted you . - This is not my fault . I had no idea . You shouldn 't have used the Darkhold . He 's right . This is all because of your obsession with that damn book . No . That book can help us now . Fix us . Or give you the power you wanted in the first place . Like we could ever find it . He 's years ahead of us . Oh . We will find the book ... and kill him ... along with anyone who tries to stop us . I 've seen a lot of breaks . Your arm is fractured , not broken . Keep trying to bust out of that , I can 't guarantee it 'll stay that way . - What are you doing ? - Looking for proof . You see , this is new for me . - I 've never been ... - A kidnapper ? Caught . You know who I am , which is a problem . For both of us . A problem that has to go away . Threaten me all you want . - You think I 'm afraid to die ? - I think you want it . No doubt . You got a death wish . Coming back to find me after I let you live . You told me not to . Said you deserved it . I 'm just looking for proof that you do . - And then ? - My problem goes away . And your wish comes true . Vincent , calm down . Well , he has it the worst . I think he wants to know your plan . We 're gonna find the book and reverse what 's been done to us . We 'll make this right . Hugo , you take those power cells . We 're gonna need them . Vincent and I will look for Joe . - And you ... - I 'll burn this place to the ground . We all need to work together . I 'm done working for you . I mean ... look what happened to us . - It would be smarter ... - You were never smarter ! You just had the damn book . You don 't control me anymore , Lucy . Take the boxes . But I 'm destroying this place . You 've got ghosts haunting you . Something in your past you can 't live with . - You could just tell me . - Haunting me ? This coming from the guy who thinks he 's possessed . I prayed for vengeance . I got it . You ? Fighting to right every wrong , all the while begging to be taken out . Seems to me your thing is serving penance . You know , we 're not so different , you and me . Yeah , you just feel bad for the dead in your wake . I don 't feel anything . If that were true , you would 've killed me by now . Are you really telling me you don 't feel curious about what 's going on out there ? You hunted those skinheads down . Why ? - They spilled innocent blood . - Wow . Listen to you . Take yourself seriously much ? They were working with the Chinese . Does that happen a lot around here ? Didn 't think so . And outfitted with RPGs . You 're not interested in how these things are connected ? Look , I know that the big picture is kind of lost on you , but someone is arming them , uniting them , and that should concern us both . - I said I 'm not what you are . - You 're enhanced , and you just said that we 're not that different . I 'm sorry , but you just said that ... like 10 seconds ago . They won 't stop until a lot of people are dead . Or they are . And who knows what kind of weapon they stole from the energy lab in Pasadena . Still haven 't been able to dig up any infor ... - Wait . What did you say ? - Momentum Alternative Energy Lab . Printout right there in your hands . Best I can tell , that 's where they stole the weapon from . But it 's been shut down for years . Wait . Does that mean something to you ? Robbie ! No ! Robbie ! Ah . Agent Simmons , there you are . Here 's the Special Advisor of Science and Technology . Glad you could finally make it . Yes , because we were supposed to meet 15 minutes ago . - Right . Unfortunately ... - Well , luckily , the United States Congress is used to waiting around . Right , guys ? 'Cause , I mean , how much work really gets done in Washington ? Although you don 't often wait around for someone who 's honestly changing the world . Oh , I don 't know if I 'm doing that . So why don 't you go ahead and tell us what you were working on that kept you ? Word of advice ... everything she does is hugely fascinating and I understand none of it , so feel free to smile and nod . It 's what I do . Well , I was just in the containment rooms . Ah , yes . One of S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s most important advances in recent years . It uses adaptive materials to contain enhanced individuals and actually neutralizes their powers . Oh , neutralize powers ... that does sound useful . - I 'd love to see them . - Great idea . But maybe not the best idea , Director . Excuse me . Guess not . What happened ? There was an incident . Blood everywhere . Not a great time . Turns out it wasn 't the best idea 'cause Agent Coulson here has a better one . Uh , who wants to step inside a real-life Quinjet ? Let 's go . Chen ? Do you have any idea what set him off ? Have you spoken to May lately ? Creepy . You ever notice we never get to check up on a bright-lit place filled with nice , friendly people ? Mack . Looks like a short electrical transient set off a quick current spike , other side of that door . Oh , boy . Mack ! We got a big problem . The reactor terminals are set to ... Whoa ! Great . This guy disappears . I hate these guys . Where 'd he go ? Think you scared him off ? What do you think the chances of that are , Turbo ? May ? What 's up ? The base has been infiltrated . Something got in . So you thought you 'd redecorate ? Maybe somebody brought something in , something that 's getting to everyone . And if you find it , you can destroy it . Yeah . That 's right . Always ready to do the brave thing . Always looking out for us . I won 't let them take you . May , uh , what if we stop , take a minute ? Rest , make a plan . I can 't . I can 't . No time . You know what ? We have current blood samples on file for every S.H.I.E.L.D. agent , even the Director . That could help us figure out who 's been infected . What ? We just have to go to the lab . How does that sound ? Yeah . He 's like the woman who got Chen , so if he does come back , you can 't let him touch you . You 'll go crazy . Don 't let him touch you ! You 'll go crazy ! He must 've set the reactor to blow . What are you talking about ? Blow up a building ? I mean , no , it could be a couple of city blocks . Then what are you talking to me for , man ? ! Shut it down ! You 're the one who keeps asking me questions ! I 'm trying to shut it down if you give me five ... - We can help you . - No . You can 't . Wait . No . May ? You all right ? Why do you want me to go to the lab so badly ? I told you ... so we can ... Okay , look . There 's a situation you need to be aware of . I 'm aware . Hyah ! And I 'm gonna stop them ! She 's sick ! Don 't hurt her ! May ! May , stop . It 's me . May , wait ! Please . You 're not well . I can help . Phil ... I 'm doing what has to be done . So am I. Agent May , I urge you to stop now . You 're a monster . I prefer the term " Inhuman . " I 'm sorry about this . Too bad you can 't put that on the tour . Not yet . - Where is he ? - Turbo , get me out of here ! I don 't understand . He 's keeping the reactor in meltdown . I won 't go back . I 'll kill you all first . I don 't know what you mean . - It was hell in there . - Fitz ! What are you ? Yeah . What are you ... Fitz , get me out of here ! Yeah , I got it . It 's stuck ! I really wish our roles were reversed right now . Fitz . We need to turn the reactor off . It 's done . No . No , no , no . Don 't . There . Is that too tight ? So ... that fire-headed Inhuman ... He 's ... not an Inhuman . - Huh ? - I 'm not sure what he is . I am . He 's a killer . That truck heist in East L.A ... . three people were brutally murdered . - What if they deserved it ? - Is that how it is now ? You 're running with a vigilante who decides who lives or dies ? I 'm not running with anyone . But he can 't be all bad . He came here tonight and he saved Fitz 's life . Yeah , but from what ? What ... What was that thing ? I have no idea . Daisy , come home with us . So we can properly take care of that arm . We have a drug that can help those bones heal faster . Now , our supply keeps running low , but we 're about to ... But you already have it , don 't you ? It 's Yo-Yo . She 's stealing it , and ... you two have been in touch this whole time . We 've been out there looking for you , trying to protect you and put the pieces back together , and you ... Why ? Why are you doing this ? Because she 's turned her back on us , Mack ! Because something terrible happened , and she didn 't want our help getting through it . Slow down , Turbo . Well , we 've all been through terrible things ... all of us ... and we 've never turned our back ! I-I 'm ... doing what I need to do . And it still affects us . Like it or not . Thank you for the splint . - Hey , can we get a picture ? - Sure . - Hey , um , do you mind ? - Not at all . Okay . Nice and close , nice and tight . There we go . You know I love a photo op , right ? All right . Thank you . Nice . Now , as tempting as it may be to post these pictures on Facebook , Snapchat , your re-election campaign website everything you saw today is confidential . You all signed an NDA , and unlike the Climate Change Accord , this one 's enforcable . So if all goes well ... we hope it does ... next time we do this , it 'll be much more public . Safe ride home , my friends . - Thanks , Director . - Thanks for coming . Bye-bye . - You got a moment ? - Sure . It 's about May . - I have a plan that I think will help ... - Oh , don 't worry , Phil . I 've got it handled . The thing is , my experience can help here . - I dealt with a similar situation when I ... - Were the Director . I know . Phil , am I getting something wrong ? This was your idea . When you stepped down , you told the President you didn 't want to be the face of the Agency . For a whole host of reasons . And you said we needed a new face . And now that Steve Rogers went AWOL , you wanted a hero . I said the new Director should be a powered person the public could trust . And they came up with you . And now you 're stuck with me . I count on you to be one of my top advisors . There 's no one better than you , truly . - Okay . So ... - But when it comes to May and Daisy , you can 't be objective . And to that , I take exception . So , you focus on being the best agent we got , and I 'll focus on being the best Director I can . But what ... what treatment are you implementing ? - How long will ... - Hey . I 'm sorry . That 's classified . Get away from me . Get away from me . Get away from me ! Get away from me ! Get away ! Come on , come on , come on , come on . Come on ! - Your friends with you ? - No . I left them . Good . You want to know what 's connecting these things . Yeah . I think it might be me .

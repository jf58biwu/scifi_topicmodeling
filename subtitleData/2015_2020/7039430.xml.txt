 Previously on Defiance ... We are a lie that 's kept us together for all these years . What lie ? I never lied to you . You taught me to believe we 're the same . Yeah , we both grew up with blood on our hands . It made you okay with killing . But not me . Would you kill this human in exchange for your husband 's life ? No . When I close my eyes I can only picture Alak as a little boy . I keep remembering this one day . We encountered a hellbug . I grabbed Alak in my arms and I ran . I held my son close , and I whispered , " I will always protect you . " Now I realize that was a lie . You killed Christie . No , I did it to save your ... Shut your lying mouth ! Always an excuse . You 've never told the truth . Alak ? Don 't hurt him ! Do I have your attention ? Good . You , my child . Have been favored , indulged . I supported your choices . I embraced Christie as my hanya tavo and convinced your father to accept the marriage . While you were captured , I thought of nothing but you . I destroyed the Arch and betrayed my town to protect you from harm ! Christie ... Christie chose death . She did it to save your child . She was a mother who sacrificed everything for her bloodline . You ungrateful coward . It is you who has shamed our family . Luke ? Is he alive ? My God . Luke . Well . At least now we know the wee one 's name . Hurry , please ! He 's killing her ! Hand me a blanket . Yes , Favi . Luke is a fine name for a boy . What are you doing ? Taking my son somewhere safe . Far away from you . Move . I will not allow this . Get out of my way , or I will kick you down the stairs . Let 's all calm down ! Not feeling very calm today , Dad ! Alak Tarr ! It 's the lawkeeper . I said step aside ! Settle down . What 's the problem here ? There 's no problem here . As you can see , we 've been reunited with our son . Andina tells me Alak attacked Stahma with a knife . Andina is not a bright girl . Clearly , she was mistaken . Is that true , Andina ? Were you mistaken ? I get confused sometimes . This is a very emotional moment for our family . If you wouldn 't mind leaving us alone to sort it all out . And where have you been all this time ? I was a prisoner in Rahm Tak 's camp . I was there the day you and Irisa took out the net-cutter . It was a terrifying ordeal . We 're just learning of it now . I need to know everything you saw . My son will be happy to share all the details with you once he 's had a hot bath and a meal . With his family . In private . They want you to leave so the three of us can get our stories straight . You see , they 're afraid that I might contradict one of the many lies they 've told you . Alak , stop talking . They 're working as spies for the VC . They blew up the Arch . Go ! Go ! Son of a bitch . Ripped By mstoll Okay , I think that 's all of us . Okay . To all of those of you who volunteered to help us with this manhunt , our town thanks you for your service . Now , as far as we know , our fugitives are still in town . This gives us a radius of searching of at least five miles . People , I need you to understand that apprehending Datak and Stahma Tarr is not about payback . You tell these people what you told me . Rahm Tak is ready to make his move . I heard him bragging about it . Can he succeed ? About a week after you guys bombed that net-cutter , I saw him buy a truckload of weapons from an arms dealer . Who ? What was his name ? I don 't know . He was a blonde guy , musk-ox coat , Bio-man bodyguard . The weapons had the Von Bach Industries logo on them . So the enemy has Von Bach tech and we 've got what , slingshots ? People , Defiance Valley is a giant terraformed basin . There 's only three ways in . Through Bissel Pass , which we have sewn up with the stasis nets . Underground , possibly through either Old Saint Louis or through the mines . Or through the mountains , by foot or some sort of aerial assault . It 's hard to prepare without knowing the invasion plan . Which is exactly where Datak and Stahma come in . They 've been working as Rahm 's spies . And , thanks to Alak , we know they 've been in regular contact . So if anybody knows his plans , it 's the Tarrs . So our job is to find them , capture them , interrogate them and find out what that plan is . Do we understand ? Okay . We 're going to need searches . House to house , street to street . Poole and Enriquez , your job , search the Hollows . What was that look ? What look ? When Alak was describing the arms dealer , you had a reaction . No reaction . We need to hear this . Conrad 's blonde . Conrad Von Bach ? Yes . Okay , yes . Alak is clearly describing my ex-boyfriend who is clearly selling weapons to our greatest enemy . I 'm angry and ashamed , but there 's nothing I can do about it . Well , maybe he 's still in broadcast range . Call him . Amanda and Berlin , you two take ... Darby Square . Thank you . I haven 't spoken to him in 2 years . What am I supposed to say ? Tell him Defiance wants to buy his product . The town can 't afford his product . Maybe you leave that part out . Report to your team leaders on the hour , every hour . And these searches both in the immediate and outlying areas , I want to be in a logical and systematic manner . Alak , you 're with me . Irisa , I need you to sit on the Tarr house on the off chance they double back and try and snatch their grandson . People , let 's do it by the numbers . Clear and intelligent . Be careful out there . You know , I 'm perfectly capable of guarding my own son . I said you 're with me . And if you do spot the Tarrs , do not engage them . Chirp me on my hailer . I 'll come running . So I 'm a baby sitter now . It 's a job that doesn 't require picking up a gun . Where are we going ? I 'll tell you when we get there . Why are you dragging me along ? In case your parents try and kill you . Oh . Why all the fuss about two spies when the whole VC army is poised to invade us ? I 'm afraid for my family . Irathients have nothing to fear . Rahm Tak will be good for the seven races . He 'll drive the humans out . Here . It 's filthy . It 's better to blend in . This won 't work . They have the entire town looking for us . That 's why we need to leave . I have weapons and cash hidden in the garden by the Hollows . Retrieve them . I 'll arrange for a roller and a way to get the stasis nets lowered . Meet me under the pedestrian bridge in 90 minutes . And if you 're not there ? I 'll be there . What about the baby ? He 's better off with Alak . A son belongs with his father . But we have each other . Just like we did when we first arrived on this planet . And just like then , we will survive and prosper . Do not lose faith ! I made you a promise back then and it still holds . As long as I am breathing , you will be safe . We 'll , we 'll make our way to Key Diego . We 'll buy a boat and anchor up along the coast line . I hear it 's rich with sea otter . A simple life . I find the notion very attractive . Yes . I married well . Be careful . I am very proud of all of you . It 's been a brutal winter , filled with blood and hardship away from your families . Plunder has been scarce since Tucumcari . Even my head collection is looking bedraggled , isn 't it ? But a thaw is coming , my friends . The first kiss of spring . In a few days we will ride into Defiance . We will fill our bellies , fill our pockets , and savor the sweet sounds of over 2,000 pink-meats crying out for mercy . We will deny them mercy the way they denied us when we first arrived here . Looking for nothing more than a home to call our own . Look around , friends . We are home ! General . The lookouts have spotted a rider on approach . From where ? Defiance ? No , from the southwest . I 'm curious . Let ' em get close . We ride for Defiance ! Identify yourself . " When Heaven falls to earth , peace shall reign . " I 'm looking for Rahm Tak . You found him . Reveal yourself . Volubela . Hello , Rahm . If you smell as dirty as you look , you 'll be sleeping alone tonight . Come on , everyone , give Volubela a proper welcome ! It 's time for celebration and news from home . Open an old-earth wine , stoke the cooking fires , and slaughter the fatted calf with music from David Bowie ? Volubela , I gift you a feast in your honor ! Oh , Rahm . You 're such a good husband . Holy crap . Close your mouth , kid . T 'evgin . Where is he ? You 're healing well . I need to talk to T 'evgin right now . I believe you 're back to normal . It is rude to stare . What brings you here , Lawkeeper ? You got a ship in orbit , right ? It has a name . Tsuroz . It 's got scopes and sensors and the like ? Where are you going with this ? The VC are about to make a move on the town . I got two Votanis Collective fugitive spies on the loose in Defiance and I can 't find ' em . I need satellite imaging on the ground . To help find your spies . Maybe take a look at the VC camp , troop movements and placements . I will not take sides in your war . This is not our war . Rahm Tak is a member of the Votanis Collective , your sworn enemy . Defiance goes down , he 's coming after you and your gulanite next . If it happens , I will deal with it . Kindzi . My father is also my commander . I support his decision . Helping us is in your best interests . Don 't you understand that ? This doesn 't make any sense . Why wouldn 't you help us ? Unless you can 't . Ooh . That trip down from orbit , that was assisted by gravity , wasn 't it ? Now that 's pretty easy . But the trip back up into orbit , that takes a lot more energy . That 's the hard part . You two are stranded here . You 're stuck . You 're weak . And you 're lying so we don 't find out about it , am I right ? I will not help you . My reasons are irrelevant . My mother was here . That is impossible . No , I would recognize my mother 's scent anywhere . You 're her boy ! Alak ! Returned from the Votanis Collective . I am very glad . So it 's true ? Alak 's mother is well versed in human culture . I wanted to learn from her to assist us to assimilate here . She taught me very well . I 'll say . How many lessons did you have ? And how recently ? Stahma 's a traitor . She mentioned this . Your kidnapping created quite a dilemma for your mother . Oh , well , that 's a real shame . So at no point did you think to tell us you were in bed with the Votanis Collective ? Stahma was available and a very willing sex partner . I could care less about her politics . Okay . This is gross . Where is she now ? I have no idea . My town ... My ship is in danger and Stahma Tarr is neck-deep in it . If I catch you helping her in any way , I am coming after you with everything I got . Let 's go . Not a word . I will copulate with anyone I damn well please . Don 't move . Stahma Tarr , you 're under arrest . Please . I 've done nothing wrong . This was all my husband 's doing . Save it , haint . Very well . I feel completely at home . Not completely . And that is why I am here , husband . It 's time for you to come back to Brasilia . I know , the children miss me . Tell them their father is doing work here , important work . Let 's tell them together . Hmm ? Come home . What 's going on , Vol ? Why did you ride all the way up here ? Why do you think ? Vice Chancellor Voske sent you . She knows you 've gone rogue . They all do . Get out . This assignment of yours . It was supposed to be a simple scouting mission . We met resistance . From the human farmers whose homes you 've burned down ? From the human children I 've seen hanging from trees ? It 's better to ask forgiveness than permission . This world barely survived one war between human and Votan . There won 't be a second Pale War , if there is no one left to fight . I will be received and celebrated as a hero when I return . Do you really believe our sons will see you that way ? Once they learn their father has perpetuated genocide in their name ? Long before they were born , back on Casti when the Arks were being constructed , our government promised kwonyo gyendo , a Votan world . Ours and ours alone . Our sons will live to see that promise fulfilled . It was a foolish promise , made in ignorance . Our leaders did not know Earth would turn out to be inhabited . They knew . They had to . So the humans of Earth must suffer for our mistake ? Someone has to . The Collective disagrees . And they 're prepared to forgive and grant you clemency . But only if you will stop this crusade . And if I refuse ? Rahm . Oh , Rahm , come home with me . Please . Lay down my burden . Resume a normal life . It 's tempting . Then be tempted . So , your mom and T 'evgin ... Okay . Can we just drop it , please ? Nolan ? What 's up , Berlin ? Datak just broke into Doc Yewll 's office . I 'm on my way back . Keep an eye on him . Shhh . I need your help getting out of town . I hope you washed your hands . It 's flu season . Please . You ever heard of the term high maintenance ? You should get it tattooed on your forehead . Are you gonna insult me or help me ? First one , then the other . Here . This should help you with your cause . Thanks , Meh . You should come with us . I don 't think so . Why not ? You don 't owe this town any loyalty . Amanda and Nolan tore the very skin from your back . They did it to save a life . An Omec life . Why is this even a conversation ? I 've had some time to think about it and ... Amanda doesn 't make the same distinctions that you and I do . To her , all lives are equally valuable . She 's such a sweet girl . Perhaps you should build a statue in her honor . I can 't help it . It 's the damn braid . They 're on the move . Well , should we grab him ? Eventually , he 'll lead us to your mother , and then we 'll grab ' em both . Yeah . Right . You 're good at this . Good news , daughter . Our gulanite levels have reached 60 % . When they reach 75 % ... Tell it to your alabaster whore . It is tradition for Omec to have many partners . Family or otherwise . You and I have not been traditional . True . Your life is less rich for knowing only my touch . I 'm not jealous . - Good . - I 'm disappointed . Why ? When I was a child , you didn 't tell me sweet lies like the other fathers , pretending I would live a long and full life . You sat me on your lap , looked me in the eye , and told me that our suns would soon collide , and all life on our planet would be extinguished . You told me the truth . I am and always will be your first father . You should have told me she 'd been here . And that you laid with her . You 're right . Stahma means nothing . She 's merely entertainment . She 'd better be . How do you plan to get the stasis nets lowered ? Well , sweet pea , how about this ? A dangerous pandemic at the Spirit Riders ' camp . I-rath flu . Only I know how to stop it from spreading . Well , that ought to work . She 's here . Go get her . I 'm risking my life . Ask nicely . Please . Uh-oh . Lawkeeper , 12 o 'clock . Shtako . Got to go . Got to go . What are you doing ? Saving my wife . Wish me luck . Grab him , now ! Come on ! Hey ! You 're a disgrace to your family , seed better left spilled ! Enough ! You don 't deserve to carry the Tarr name . You think I want it ? Your name is a curse . Especially in this town . Okay , visiting hours are over . No . I 'm not going anywhere . I want to hear what he has to say . Suit yourself . See , here 's my dilemma . Everything you say sounds perfectly reasonable . You were prisoners , forced to collude with the enemy to keep your son alive . A plausible story that , taken on face value , I can understand . Hell , I can even sympathize with you . Well , that 's very decent of you . It does not , however , explain the fact that you committed acts of terror and treason against the people of Defiance . It doesn 't explain why you 've been lying to me ever since you got back into town . Hell , I don 't even know that you 're not lying to me right now . So you 're gonna torture him ? I 'm going to do whatever I need to do to get the job done . I have nothing useful to tell you . Do your worst . I intend to . Whoa ! Whoa ! Get your hands off my son . Well , you seem awfully concerned for him when a moment ago you were saying he was a disgrace to the family name . Shtak , Nolan ! You can 't do this ! I can do whatever I want ! You 're bluffing . Now , your son said that Rahm Tak has a bunch of fancy new weapons and a plan to enter Defiance . Tell me what that plan is ! This is all your fault . I spied for the Collective under extreme duress . I have no love or loyalty for Rahm Tak . I know nothing of his plans . Lies ! At the camp , Stahma and I were forced to humor him . Liar ! Ahhh ! He told us nothing . Nothing ! You don 't want to tell me the plans , say goodbye to your little boy . Believe me ! Please ! Please ! I don 't know anything . I swear to you . Don 't kill him ! I swear to you , I 'm telling the truth ! Don 't kill him . Please ! Nolan ! Nolan , he 's my only child . What do you think ? You believe him ? Yeah . I believe him . You were both bluffing . Oh , well played . Well played . Andina ? Andina ! Andina ? Luke . Luke 's right here . Where 's Andina ? At the market . She ran out of makfyegyo . - Hey . - I said I watched Bear . Bear ? Bear is what Pilar called him . When were you guys with Pilar ? Nolan and I found her with the baby in the woods outside of the VC camp . So it was you guys who rescued him ? Huh ? What about Pilar ? Nolan shot her . Good . On our way back to Defiance , I noticed he liked to stare up at the sky . So I pointed out all the clouds shaped like different animals . He started crying after Andina left . Hey . Well , I brought him outside . I thought maybe a look up at the sky might calm him . Oh , here . He has your eyes . Uh-huh . Ah ... Thank you . I 'm just doing my job . No , I mean thanks for saving my son . I don 't want to hurt you . What do you want ? Together we will drive to Bissel Pass . You will order the stasis nets lowered . We will travel somewhere far away , somewhere safe . Once I am convinced Nolan has not followed us , I will free you . That 's a lawkeeper 's gun . Whose blood is on it ? One of the deputies . He tried to arrest me . You 're a terrorist , you know that , right ? I 'm a mother who loved her son . Perhaps more than I should have . Don 't laugh at me . Oh , hey , I 'm just taking a moment to enjoy what a great mother you are , Stahma . You love Alak so much , you had to kill his wife ! Just like Kenya . You loved her so much you had to kill her . You are so beautiful , Stahma . You 're not good . You 're not loving . You 're just a vicious , nasty thug . I think one of us is going to die . It would have been so easy for me to blow up the Arch while you were still inside it . I chose not to kill you then , and I choose not to kill you now . I hope you go to your grave wondering why . Drinks are on me . What are we celebrating ? It 's a thank-you . Why didn 't you tell me it was you and Irisa who rescued Luke ? Didn 't seem to matter that much . You rescued my son . Think it 'd be better for him if I was less like me and more like you . I 'm weak . Not true . You survived seven months of captivity in the wild with a madwoman and kept your son alive . You escaped from Rahm Tak 's camp and helped us ferret out a couple of spies . In my book , that makes you one smart , capable , strong young man . Doesn 't make me a good father . Well , if you 're trying to hold me up as an example there , you 're going to be sorely disappointed . My version of parenting was to take a perfectly good kid and try and turn her into a stone cold killer . I screwed her up royally in the process . No . Irisa 's the best . She presents well . Actually , that 's not true . She doesn 't present well . Not at all . But you love her . Mmm . I 'd die for her . And she loves you back ? I guess . Maybe that 's enough ? Couple of screw-ups like you and me ? We better hope so . I miss Christie . I know you do , son . Anything ? Nobody 's come in or out . They 've been in there a long time . Should we go in and check on him ? We wait . I didn 't mean for any of this . You have to believe me . You have to forgive me . I 'm losing touch with what 's important . I 'm losing touch . General ? She was an assassin . Sent by the humans under the guise of peace . They 're getting smarter . Then I guess it 's high time we teach them a lesson , wouldn 't you say ? Bebe , put on some coffee . It 's time to burn the city . You know you had this coming . Tsk . You bombed the Arch . You killed people . Let me ask you ... How many lives would you be willing to sacrifice for your daughter ? How many lives have you already sacrificed ? Oh , leave me out of this . I 'm nothing like you . You 're right about that . Were you there when they did in Rafe McCawley ? The man died on his feet , trying to save Christie . He took down three VC soldiers and wounded Rahm Tak himself . Stupid . And noble . Sounds like Rafe . Good man . His heroism shames us all . Amanda 's going to hang me for treason , isn 't she ? Not fair to put it all on her shoulders , but ... Yeah , she 's gonna hang you . Could I have a dash more salt ? Stahma ! I need your help . Ripped By mstoll

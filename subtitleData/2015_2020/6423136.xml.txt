 Previously on " marvel 's agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Now you know how it feels , coulson - - to watch someone you care for bleed out right in front of you . No ! Ward , what did you do ? Agent MacKenzie , to take ward out , I need to cross some lines the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. shouldn 't cross . What , you want me to fill in ? As acting director until it 's finished . Hunter : Trace puts ward in the southwest of england . They 're at the castle where we brought Simmons back . Which would explain why he kidnapped her and Fitz . 'Cause malick 's trying to open another portal . It wants to come back . And finally , after all these years , we found someone to help us do that . Simmons : Fitz , you can 't do this . We can 't let them bring that thing back to this planet . I lost you once . I can 't lose you again . Only thing I 'm gonna bring back is will . Okay ? Find it , get to the exit coordinates , we 'll turn the portal back on in exactly 12 hours . Be the one that finishes what hydra started . Coulson : Looks like they 're getting ready . That 's ward . Bobbi : He 's going through . Coulson , wait ! Shut it down . Is something wrong ? Fitz . Go ahead and scout that Ridge . We have less than six hours to find the next portal and go home . Why don 't you shut the hell up so I can concentrate ? This program 's a work in progress , designed from Simmons' limited data and hypothetical calculations . See ? Our exit location is determined by the position of the - - just figure it out . Aah ! Let me be clear if I don 't make it back , Simmons will be killed - - slowly , horribly . It 'd all be your fault . Is that what you want ? What do you want ? Why are we here ? Find some ancient , mythical creature . Wake up , ward . This is a snark hunt , and the only reason malick sent you is because you 're expendable . Man : Sir , over here ! Move . Move ! Is that ... Hail hydra . Hail hydra . One of you want to tell me what coulson was thinking jumping out of the quinjet like that ? I would say he wasn 't so much thinking as feeling - - feeling that ward needs to die . And you didn 't try to stop him . Full disclosure - - I was planning on jumping , as well . Again , less thinking than feeling . Coulson went there to get our people . " Our people " - - what are you talking about ? We believe that ward took Fitz or Simmons through the portal with him . Hopefully , coulson can find them and bring them back safely . All we have to do is take control of the castle and open the portal so they can return . So , just take the ultra-fortified hydra castle and open the alien portal . That 's it ? You know , you 're wired different than most folks . I 'm not saying it 'll be easy . I wouldn 't mind hearing it 's gonna be easy . It 'll be easy . Doesn 't work if I know you 're lying . Mack - - or , director , you guys should get up here . This is hydra 's compound outside the castle . And these two trucks were just unloaded . Lincoln : What are they bringing in now ? More weapons ? Inhumans . They 're stockpiling inhumans . That 's how I read it . Looks like 10 or 12 of those gel-matrix containers . Andrew - - he 's probably down there , as well . Okay . So , are we rescuing inhumans or saving coulson or attacking hydra or is there some kind of combo ? Sorry . New guy just trying to understand how this whole S.H.I.E.L.D. thing works . This is how S.H.I.E.L.D. works . You make a plan , plan turns to rubbish , we make a new plan . Oh , just to be crystal clear , this is the part where the plan turns to rubbish . Whatever the new plan , we need to make sure those inhumans are safe . And find Fitz and Simmons . And we get coulson back through the portal . Would everyone just shut up a second ? Even cloaked , hydra 's missiles will find us if we get too close . And I will not be the one who has to tell coulson we got his fancy new plane blown up . Now , the only way to take the castle and secure the portal is on the q.T. That means no gunfire and no backup . We leave all tactical support up here . Is that clear ? Two infiltration teams - - one to search the compound for Fitz or Simmons and one to secure the portal . We 'll take care of everyone , including the inhumans , but first things first . Go . Satellite 's at your disposal . Find us a back door , tremors . The cargo 's here . All inhuman systems are stable and online . The team is ready to revive them . Patience , Mr. giyera . They 're not our toys to play with . They 're presents for our friend once Grant ward brings it back . Every general needs an army . So , how long do we have once the portal reopens ? 73 seconds . Simmons : He 's wrong . Your team 's calculations are off at 61 . 12 seconds might not seem like much , but on that planet , it can be the difference between life and death . Thank you . I 'm not doing it for you . Don 't want you all mucking up Fitz 's return . Did you notice the Hebrew word " maveth " carved around the castle ? Death . That 's right . Well , death is the only thing returning through that portal . Fitz was just ... An offering to show him the door . The original machinery used to open the portal was hydroelectric , but the nearest river is almost a half a mile away , which got me wondering how they powered it . May : Aqueducts . Yep . So they brought the water along there and then up through the portal chamber . Now , that looks like an overflow drain deep in the woods , so we should be able to slip into the compound without anyone seeing a thing . I 'll exit here with Bobbi and hunter . Hopefully , we can barricade ourselves long enough to open the portal and get coulson back . May , you and Daisy take Lincoln and Joey , and you come out here , on the southeast side . Let 's find our people and get out . Hey , here 's a great idea . Why don 't we go to an alien world and summon a hell beast ? Yeah , that 's a brilliant idea . What could possibly go wrong with that ? How are you supposed to find it ? Not your concern . You just whisper its name three times into a mirror ? Or do you put a saucer of milk outside the door at night ? Not milk . Ah , yes , you 're right . Simmons said it can smell blood . That 's not disturbing at all . Who wouldn 't want to be on that team ? Uh ... I think that 's the Ridge we 're looking for . You know , uh , Simmons also said it can drive people crazy . You 're doing a pretty good job of that yourself . What 's that ? That 's an interesting question . I thought I might check . Get away from there ! Hello ? ! Will ? ! Hey . Hey , will . You 're Fitz . Yeah . Shh . I warned you - - wait , wait ! Who the hell is this ? This is will , okay ? He 's gonna be our guide . Good morning . I thought I 'd lost you . Nope . I 'm still right here . I don 't remember - - we overslept , which is nice . But now you need to get up . How about we stay here for a while instead ? Mm . Nothing would make me happier . But it 's time . They need you , Phil - - more than ever . Just one more minute . No . Now . Get up ! Ah . I 'll be damned . Tatooine . Fitz : You can 't do this ! Ward , listen to me ! You can 't kill him ! It 's your fault , Fitz ! You didn 't follow my instructions ! But I did ! I did ! That 's why we 're here ! We 're all dead without him . You told me to identify the exit point , which I can do , but only that man there , the one you want to kill , can get us there in time ! Hmm . So , how long you been here ? Feels like forever . So you 're how Simmons managed to survive all those cold nights , huh ? Hmm . Maybe you want to pull the trigger . Grow up , ward . Can you walk on that leg ? What happened ? I got attacked after Jemma left . You saved her . She made it out , and now I 'm here to take you back . I can leave ? Really ? Yeah . Yeah , we 're all gonna leave . You said you were attacked . By what ? It . So you know how to find " it " ? Why would you want to do that ? I brought it a gift . We should go . Nicely done , rookie . Bobbi and hunter are with me . May , you take the power rangers . Go find Fitz or Simmons . Okay , we definitely want to avoid the guy with the suit . He 's telekinetic . Is that the one where he can read your mind or move stuff with his mind ? Move stuff . Good . I don 't want anyone knowing what I 'm thinking right now . You mean that you 're not a hero ? That you 're freaking out and want to be anywhere but here ? We 're all feeling that . I 'm not . Okay . All of us but may . You 're doing great , okay ? Just breathe , stick close , and follow our lead . Be a hell of a lot easier if it wasn 't lit up like a county fair . On it . Check the generator . Can you run ? I don 't know . Why ? Ward works for the same group that sent you here . They 've been sending people over for centuries . Sacrifices . Their real agenda is to find the creature and bring it back . Ward found a way to bring it back ? No . I did . To get Simmons back . Ward 's just a hydra toady who hijacked it . Hydra . That 's an old name . Yeah , they 're still at it . Cut off one head , and blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . I didn 't know i was doing something they 'd been working on for ages . You 're bleeding . Yeah , so are you . You know , I ran a dozen scenarios in my head , wondering what it 'd be like when we finally met . There 's a lot more blood , and I never considered the smell . I can see why Jemma loves you . Good news is , ward needs us alive . I 'm the only one that can read the data and get us to the extraction point . Just have to try and find a way to lose him before we get to the exit . Follow my lead . What 's the holdup ? There 's no holdup . We just need to make it through that canyon . You sure ? That 's the only way to make it in time . All right . Lead on . Inhumans . Man : The prisoner 's escaped ! Seal the perimeter ! This is our containment module . Andrew : Jemma ! Help me , please . Let me out . Coulson send you ? No . I - - I - - I 'm a prisoner . Hydra 's looking for me . Where are we ? England . Hydra 's got Fitz . They 've reopened the portal . Let me out . I can help . I 've seen your help - - autopsied the bodies . Is that why you handed me over to hydra ? We didn 't know they controlled the atcu . May and coulson were trying to save you . Save - - maybe you didn 't hear , but Melinda shot me . Well , can 't say I blame her after how you 've misbehaved . Jemma , we may disagree about the inhumans , but we both hate hydra . Open this door , and I 'll protect you . I would never , ever hurt you . But hydra will kill you . Maybe you wouldn 't , but what about that thing you 've be- - you got to let me out , Jemma . I 'm the only one who can protect you . Circle behind . Get your hands up . Back up . It 's okay . It 's all right . Just don 't shoot . Just don 't shoot . - Oh , god ! - Aah ! Aah ! Hang in there , Fitz . Ward : I saw something today . Looked like a giant statue . Ancient . Looked like a shrine . It used to live there . Yeah , but who built it ? Were there people here ? Like a civilization ? All I 've ever seen here is death . Ah . Well , pretty impressive you 've survived all these years . Couldn 't have been easy . I learned to adapt . Change or die . That 's worked for me , as well . The earth 's going through a big change right now - - some kind of alien contagion . Call themselves inhumans . I 'm not thrilled about it , but the wind 's blowing that way , so ... It 's gonna be a bad one ! I 'm used to it . Simmons told me about an area called the no-fly zone . You 're leading us there , aren 't you ? We 're already in it . Stay close . Hunter : Where are we ? Mack : Pretty sure that 's us . Brilliant . Just confirming it 's really us . It is . You 're welcome . If we 're here and we want to go there , we need to get past about a dozen hydra soldiers , and we need to do it as covertly as possible . Copy that . Are we supposed to wait here or help - - we need to stay hunkered down , sir ! We don 't have time for this ! Hey ! I think we took a wrong turn ! This is our loca- - you said they were gonna kill us . You have a better idea ? What are you doing ? It 's not him . It 's me . Okay . Let 's see what we 've got . Daisy , watch out ! Unh ! No , Lincoln , don 't ! There 's no way they didn 't hear that . Come on . We 've got to go . Did you see that ? ! I 'm bulletproof ! Ha ! Investigating gunfire now . Stop ! Unh ! Agent may ! Fitz . Ward took him through the portal . Come on . We 're gonna get him back . Andrew 's here . You saw him ? He saved my life . Andrew or lash ? Technically , i think it was both . We could find him , maybe - - no . That 's not the mission . Daisy , I 've got Simmons . Heading your way now . We got to go ! Fan out ! Find them ! Aah ! No . You 'll never find Fitz without me . I 'm not here for Fitz . Maybe . But you 're not gonna let him die here , either . Fitz is a smart guy . He 'll find his way back . He 'll be dead within the hour . The creature who lives here can smell blood . Fitz is bleeding . So are you . Now get up . You 're gonna lead the way . The party 's this way . Watch your step . Left a few breadcrumbs to find our way home . Simmons . Hydra knows we grabbed her . How secure are we in here ? Rough estimate ? Not very . We 've sealed and barricaded the doors , but hydra has plenty of big-boy toys to smash their way in . I might be able to reinforce the doors . You know , using my , uh - - my , uh - - amazing new superpower . Yeah . That . Let 's give that a go , then . Mack 's through there . There she is . That 's what I 'm talking about . Now , do you have any idea how the hell these rocks work ? Is that counting down to a good thing or a bad thing ? It 's the time remaining until the portal reopens . And answering your question , I don 't believe we have to do anything to these rocks . They 're configured so they 'll activate at the designated time . So that 's a good thing . That depends on whether Fitz can locate the extraction point and who or what is with him . He 'll make it . Coulson 's there . I know , but it 's more complicated than that . Ward 's mission is to - - where 's may ? Oh , no . Dr. garner is here on the premises . I spoke with him . He 's actually the one who saved me . He 's free ? May must have gone back for him . To do what ? I 'd say that depends on what she finds . Oh , god . Ward : Saw something terrible today . When I say " terrible , " i mean ancient and powerful . It 's changed how I see things . I 've never believed i was worth anything ... That what I said or did had any meaning . Maybe that 's why I 'm a spy . Or why I agreed to come here . If you 're trying to talk me out of this , you can save your breath . I 'm not looking for mercy or absolution . I just want you to know , I 've been where you are right now . Filled with rage , wanting revenge ... I chose hydra for petty , personal , selfish reasons - - for a father figure , for vengeance ... For closure . But what I saw today gave my life meaning . For the first time ever , i have a sense of satisfaction that I never experienced when I was seeking revenge . Got to say , feels pretty satisfying to me . Now turn around and keep walking . You know , everyone had this place wrong . It isn 't death . It 's a new beginning . Malick was right . This is all meant to be . And the fact that you followed me here , that we 're in this together , that just confirms the fact that I am part of a grand plan . I see that now . I honestly have no idea what you 're talking about . You will . Malick sent ward to bring back some ancient hydra god ? Well , he didn 't use those exact words , but that 's the general idea , yes . It 's why he had the atcu collect inhumans , why he shipped them here to the castle - - as some kind of army for this powerful alien . Look , we all want Fitz and coulson back . What if that thing comes back , too ? Your mother was terrified of the monolith for a reason . You think the hydra thing is what she was afraid of ? Bobbi : When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell , fury sent us onto the iliad to keep hydra from getting their hands on that monolith . What if he knew that they wanted to bring this creature back through it ? Oh , come on . What , an ancient alien god ? Are you people hearing the words coming out of your mouths ? The world 's changing . Deal with it . You were there . Did you see it ? What 's it like ? I did see it . But I can 't really describe what it looked like . It 's more how it felt , which is old and pained , as if it once had great power but lost it . And the entire planet is a wasteland . How that came to be , I can 't really say , not in any scientific terms , but my sense and certainly will 's heartfelt belief was that the creature is the one responsible - - that it caused the desolation . We have to destroy all this . You mean once Fitz and coulson find will and come back through . I mean , what if they 're not the ones who come back through ? We can 't risk that . Whatever we decide to do isn 't the end of the mission . There are a dozen inhumans in this compound that we can 't leave behind . May : Yes , you can . They 're dead . Lash or Andrew - - honestly , I 'm not sure there 's a difference anymore ... He killed them all . Sir , S.H.I.E.L.D. has infiltrated the castle , barricaded themselves inside the portal chamber . We need to get you off the premises . You have less than 15 minutes to breach their barricades and regain control of that chamber . Sir , I really - - that 's an order , soldier . Hold up . How long before that portal opens ? There 's a timer on my watch . Come on . We need to move faster . I could move faster if you hadn 't shot me ... Twice . What 's that ? I 'm gonna go out on a limb and guess hydra . We reinforced the barricades , but it won 't take them long to break through . No way they 're taking us again . We can 't destroy it before Fitz and coulson return , not when we 're this close . What if the creature comes through instead ? We 'll be waiting for them with these . And what if we can 't kill it ? Can 't speak for everyone , but I 'll probably run . Get everyone through the tunnel and back up to Zephyr one . I 'm going to stay here until the last possible second for coulson , Fitz , and will . Now , if hydra or that alien thing gets inside here , you light this castle and compound up with every missile on that plane . Or Bobbi and I can cover a couple of the barricaded entrances , buy us enough time for the portal to open . Yeah , I 'm down with that plan . If hydra tries to get through the barricades , I can - - mack : Hey ! What part of " that 's an order " do you not understand ? Coulson put me in charge to make the hard call , and that 's what I 'm doing . We can 't afford to lose our best agents in one fell swoop - - not here , not tonight ! Now , if I don 't get out ... May 's the new director . That 's what coulson would want . Okay . But one thing - - I 'm staying with you , because , " a , " i can keep the portal open if something goes wrong , and , " b , " I 'm your partner . Technically , that 's two things . Daisy stays . Everyone else , get the hell out of here ! Is your leg gonna be okay ? I don 't really feel it . The portal 's just over this rise . It 's gonna be close , but I think we 're gonna make it . Jemma 's gonna be really happy to see you . This must be very difficult for you . Getting you off this godforsaken planet is all that matte- - Jemma never told me there was an ancient civilization here . She never saw it . We 're still in the no-fly zone . What else do you know about the ancient city ? What happened to it - - whoa ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , hey . Hang on , hang on . Let me fix that . There used to be nine cities on this planet . The beings who lived there were fairly advanced . But they feared change . They were easily divided . They warred among themselves , destroyed their entire race . You seem to know a lot about them . They had a chance to become something great , something beautiful , but ... In the end ... How do you know so much about - - because I was there . You 're not will . No . Will died saving Jemma ... From me . Unh ! May : Listen up . All weapons systems online , then take her up to 20,000 feet . Bobbi . Looks like hydra 's inside the castle . They 're gonna make it , right ? Tell me that was you . That 's just them getting closer . Okay , tremors , let 's hope this works . Forgot about this part . Get out of here . I can handle everything . I 'm not leaving . I 'll be fine . Did you see that ? One minute left . We don 't have much time . You may have to hold this thing open . In case you-know-what shows up instead of our peeps . Anything other than our people comes out , we give may the high sign and blow it to hell . Same if hydra gets in here . It 's open . There 's the portal . - That 's good . - But that 's not . Hydra 's almost in . All weapons systems - - go hot . Stand by for my command . How many people ? Unh ! The lives you 've taken . It 's over , ward . We 're out of time . Coulson ! The portal 's closing ! He 's finished ! Leave him ! Let 's go ! Now ! Now ! We have to go ! Do it , may ! Now ! Open the doors ! I 'm bringing them in ! Man : Sir , your plane is waiting at the airport . We 'll have you there in less than 30 minutes . Well , I 'll be damned .

 KARELLEN : Previously on Childhood 's End ... SIOBHAN : They 're downing all air traffic all over the world . REPORTER : At least 40 cities around the world now have these vessels hovering over them . My name is Karellen . I am the Supervisor for Earth . Suffering will end . Injustice will end . War , famine , inequality . These will be things of the past . SIOBHAN : It 's world peace . All hold hands and sing Kumbaya . KARELLEN : This is an invasion . Ahhh ! All right ! DANLOW : I just heard they kidnapped a farmer named Richard Stormgren . There 's no need to be afraid . My name is Karellen . - Why are you here ? - We need a messenger . Gentlemen , welcome to the Golden Age of Man . Your mind ... It just blossomed when they arrived , didn 't it ? They say that science is dying . So what do you wanna do about that ? I wanna be the first person to visit their planet . Milo ! No ! Oh , God ! No , no . No matter how mighty the Overlords may seem . We can never give up the fight . As long as you stay hidden back here , there 's always gonna be people that don 't trust you . KARELLEN : Your work is done here . - What ? - KARELLEN : Goodbye . ( SOBBING ) There is no need to be afraid . MILO : It 's now the year 2035 , and just look at us . Nineteen years after the Overlords ' arrival , four years after Karellen revealed his true form , we 're living our lives under their watchful gaze . No inequality , no crime , no war . Our differences put aside , one society now under the hospices of the World Federation . We have renewable , clean energy and enough food to feed the planet . All of our material needs satisfied . Death is still a fact of life , But free from disease , stress , and all the things that turned us gray . We live longer , healthier lives . The birthrate is soaring . We have a world that we are proud to bring children into . For those who cling to the old ways , there 's always New Athens . ( HORNS BLARING ) But for the rest of us , it 's the Golden Age of Man . Utopia . So , why am I terrified for the future ? You might call it blissful ignorance . But it 's still ignorance . Even at The Boyce Institute , scientific enquiry is dying . If anything , since Karellen forged a special bond with Dr. Rupert Boyce , it 's dying even faster . I want to know why . Hey . Didn 't realize they 'd close your whole program down . Yeah , well , we designed the space orbital and the engineers are building it . Dr. Boyce can give you another research post . I asked him . He bounced it back . The Orbital 's probably gonna be our last serious project . I hope I 'm wrong . So that means you 're leaving Africa ? Yeah . Maybe . I mean , what 's there to keep me ? Yeah , sure . Are you stealing the Titan drives ? ( CHUCKLING ) Of course not . I mean , nobody steals anything anymore , Rachel . Okay , but you ... You are stealing six petabytes of hard drive . Private research . I mean , for 20 years the Overlords have told us precisely nothing about themselves . About where they come from , about their language . I 'm a guy that likes to know stuff . Don 't be such a fruitcake . ( SOFTLY ) No , no , no , no . Don 't rip my house apart again . Thank you . ( ROOSTER CROWING IN THE DISTANCE ) ( HORSE NEIGHING IN THE DISTANCE ) Very good to see you , Ricky . Wow . You just , uh ... Show up . You don 't call , you don 't write . You know , I never got to ask you . Uh , I mean , you guys have ... You 've done this before on other worlds , right ? So , I mean , have there been other guys like me ? You know , I mean have you picked some fish guy to talk to the fish people on Fish Planet , or something like that ? How are you feeling ? Um ... I feel fine . Uh , tired . I 'm really tired . Pretty much been , uh , been harvesting nonstop . You know , Ellie and I are still trying to get pregnant , and that 's not going so well . Plus , the Rams have had a terrible start to their season so this whole Utopia thing 's a bit of a debatable point in our house right now . Obviously , you didn 't come here to talk about football . No , I didn 't . So , why are you here ? To apologize . For what ? Should I sugar the pill ? ( WHIRRING ) Karellen ? Yeah . Yeah , everything 's okay . I 'm glad everything 's okay . Why is it okay ? Nah , he 's just checking in on us . Making sure we 're all right . In the middle of the night ? Sure he was . What ? Seriously . Hey . Everything is fine . REPORTER 1 : We found three eyewitnesses now who all saw a pod blasting away from the Stormgren farm . So it 's official sports fans , Karellen has been back to visit his Blue Collar Prophet after 20 years . REPORTER 2 : It 's fair to say that here on this side of the pond , curiosity is just as high as in the former US . REPORTER 1 : According to our affiliate in Missouri , we do have confirmation now ... REPORTER 3 : We don 't know what the Supervisor for Earth has told Ricky but undoubtedly it 's significant . And the world once again turns to a modest farm in Missouri . Give me some credit here , Ricky . Karellen didn 't come down to see if we were flossing regularly . Well , he said that the Earth has a new destiny . What does that mean ? I have ... I have no idea what 's waiting for us . TOMMY : Dad , come see this . JAKE : Oh . TOMMY : It 's Karellen . - He 's back . - NEWS ANCHOR : The Spokesman of Earth has been scientist and entrepreneur , Rupert Boyce . Why Karellen returned to the Stormgren farm last night ... I would not mind being a fly on that wall , huh ? Yeah , it 's got to be important . I mean , if he 's back , something 's going to happen . Oh . JAKE : Nice . ( RUMBLING ) ( LLAMA BRAYING ) ( ANIMALS SCREECHING ) ( RUMBLING ) ( RUMBLING CONTINUES ) ( DOGS BARKING ) ( ANIMALS SCREECHING ) ( SCREECHES ) MORTON : Dr. Boyce ? Dr. Boyce ? - What is it ? - MORTON : It 's not us . Not an earthquake . It just appeared . MORTON : Dr. Boyce ? Dr. Boyce , we don 't know where it came from . I know where it came from . ( CHUCKLES ) ( WHIRRING ) They just built it . Just like that . ( SNAPS FINGERS ) ( CHUCKLES ) Incredible . MORTON : They just ... Just created an entire room . Karellen said that something special was coming . I think it 's magnificent . MORTON : Why all of this for just a child 's toy ? DR. BOYCE : No , no , no , no , no . This is no toy . ( CHUCKLES ) ( LOW WHIRRING ) What 's with the board , Karellen ? Huh ? You want us talking to ghosts ? It is a communication device . One assumes he wants us to talk to somebody . ( WHIRRING ) ( BUZZING ) ( PANTING ) ( WHISPERING ) We have to save the children . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) We have to save the children . It 'll end and begin . - ( SOFTLY ) Hey , hey , hey , hey ... - ( GASPS ) - ( DOOR CLOSES ) - AMY : Tommy ? Tommy ? Tommy ? JAKE : Shh . Shh . All right . JAKE : Tom ? Tommy ? Tommy ? Oh ! Jesus . TOMMY : It will end and begin . What are you doing , pal ? You all right ? ( WHISPERING ) Don 't touch us . Come on , let 's , uh ... Let 's get you to bed . Don 't touch us ! ( GROANS ) ( COUGHING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) " Religious criticism has also expressed beliefs that the Ouija board " reveals information , which should only be in God 's hands . " And , thus , it is a tool of Satan . " Don 't know what it was . It was , uh ... It was a powerful force . From our nine-year-old son ? I was physically attacked by something . Come on , don 't start acting weird around him . JAKE : I 'm not acting weird . AMY : He thinks that he 's done something wrong . JAKE : Look , Amy , you don 't remember anything of the nights recently . I do . He 's walking around with that stare and , you , I mean you 're not sleeping well . I had stomach pains . You 're screaming in your sleep - about children . - What ? About saving children . It 's like you 're fighting something . And , and Tom is ... He 's not himself . All right . We could take him to see someone , but I don 't know exactly what we 'd say . Well , we could start with , um ... " It will end and begin . " - I take it you 're the Greggsons ? - Yes . And you must be Tom . Hi , uh ... We spoke on the phone . Nice to meet you in person , Miss Jones . So , uh ... Uh , you 're ... You 're not a doctor ? No , no , I 'm a fully qualified counselor , one of a dying breed . I don 't like it here . Tom ! Our son Tommy is having some behavioral issues . Well , I think it 's a little more serious than that . Mom , I want to go . I don 't like it . PERETTA : I don 't blame you , Tom . ( CHUCKLES ) It 's kind of a depressing place , right ? You probably want to be outside or in your room at home . Why don 't I come visit you there ? RACHEL : The eyes of the macaques ... You should 've seen them . MILO : I saw it in a dog in the street , too . It 's like it wasn 't even human , uh , if you know what I mean . And this is being reported across a 20-mile radius . Could it have something to do with the animals we 've been collecting for the Overlords ? I 'm sure they were just scanning for disease or mange . Surely there 's nothing wrong with asking Karellen . Dr. Rodricks , isn 't your wonderful work with us finished ? Yes , sir . Thank you . But if I could just have five minutes with the Supervisor ... Dr. Osaka , would you excuse us please ? I ... DR. BOYCE : You 're very much like I was , Milo . A headstrong young biologist full of ideas and theories , burning through my inheritance trying to make a name for myself . MILO : ( SCOFFS ) Yeah , peas in a pod . DR. BOYCE : I understand your frustration . When the Overlords came , they raised all these exciting questions about the cosmos , but they refused to answer any of them . It 's not just about me . They 've killed scientific enquiry . Which is why I 'm determined to stay as close to them as possible . That is why I built this place . That is why I do what they ask . I 'm maintaining as much scientific enquiry as I can . Sending live animals into space ? What does that teach us about them ? Because there 's one species they haven 't collected . Us . Homo sapiens . Eventually I 'll persuade Karellen to take me to his planet . I 'll be the first person to see another planet lit by another sun . That 's , uh ... That 's incredible , Dr. Boyce . I wish you all the luck in the world . I 'm telling you this because I like you , Milo . But I 'm also warning you . I need Karellen on side . So don 't go tugging on the lion 's tail , son . It 's in my bones and there 's nothing they can do . Make the seconds count , baby . Every one . ( GASPS ) Argh ! Oh ! ( EXHALES ) ( DOORBELL RINGS ) PERETTA : You feel more like talking today , Tom ? I can 't tell them what happens . PERETTA : Why not ? They get scared if you tell them what 's gonna happen . Well , I 'm not your mom or your dad . You can tell me . I go places . Far away . Where it 's dark and where it 's hot . TOMMY : Far away . AMY : Maybe we should be in there . She 's a professional . If she can get him to talk , then that 's got to be a good thing , right ? Do you really think I 'm over-reacting ? PERETTA : And what else do you see when you travel , Tom ? An eye . A single giant eye . I see fire in the ground . Smoke in the air . It blocks out the stars . You imagine this place ? No , I go there . They take me there . Who do you think takes you there ? They do . The Overlords ? - ( ECHOING ) It 's okay , Tom . - ( BABY CRYING ) It 's not real . It can 't hurt you . It 's in your mind . Minds are funny things . They can change the way we see the world . They can fool us . ( BABY CONTINUES CRYING ) What do you hear , Tom ? Tell me . Tell me what you hear . Shall we get your parents in ? Tom , what is it ? Tom ? - Tom , what is it ? - ( SCREAMING ) No ! AMY : Tom ? - Mom ! - Hey , what 's wrong ? Mom ! Ahhh ! What the hell did you do ? - Nothing . Nothing . - ( BABY CONTINUES CRYING ) PERETTA : Listen to me ... Tom , you need to stop . Ahhh ! Tom ? - ( INAUDIBLE ) - ( BABY CRYING LOUDLY ) - Tom ? - Stop ! JAKE : Tom , look at me . Will you stop ! - ( INAUDIBLE ) - ( BABY CRYING LOUDLY ) ( CHOKING ) ( PERETTA GASPING ) It 's okay , Mom . It 's okay . The baby 's stopped crying . I 'm ... I 'm not having a baby , Tom . ( PANTING ) Hey , Peretta ? Wait . Wait . Jeez . You saw that , right ? What is going on ? I mean , what is it ? What 's ... What 's wrong with Tom ? I don 't know what I just saw . - I have to go . - No , hey , Peretta ... You 're coming back , though , right ? I mean , my own son is scaring me . Be safe , Jake . Bye . ( DOOR OPENS ) Hey . What 's happening ? I 'll take your jacket here . Got it . Wow . I know he told you something and I know when you 're holding something back . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Don 't sugarcoat it . Listen , Els , all those times I went to the Overlords ' ship , um ... CHILDREN : Hey , Ricky ! ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) You gotta be kidding me . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) RICKY : Guys , back on the other side of the fence . You can 't be over here . ALL : Ricky ! Ricky ! RICKY : Come on , let 's go inside . What do you people want ? - Ellie . - A sermon from the Mount ? Karellen tells us no more than he tells you . ( GROANS ) Ahh ! ( GROANING ) Your lymph system is under huge strain . White cells are going through a rapid metastasis . Now , we can drastically reduce the rate of organ decay . But , uh ... But you can 't stop it . I 'm afraid it also explains why you haven 't been able to conceive a child . ( SIGHS ) Doc ? Could you ... - Yeah . - RICKY : Thanks . You can beat this . ( SIGHS DEEPLY ) Karellen said that there was something in the fabric of the ship . It poisoned me . I don 't think I can beat this , Els . You did everything that they asked of you . He won 't let you down and he won 't let you die . I 'm sorry . - Hey , no , no , no . I 'm sorry . - I 'm sorry that I can 't give you ... Come here . This is me . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . ( ELLIE CRYING ) ( EXHALES ) I need to talk to you . We never had a normal life since you chose him . We can 't have real friends . We don 't have children . You owe us , Karellen . ( ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ) Help us ! ( RADIO CLATTERS ) Hello , stranger . Jim . What are you doing here ? Someone 's gotta keep her spick-and-span . How 's the congregation ? We could almost muster a baseball team . We miss you , Peretta . I 'm sorry , I 've been busy . Why are you shaking ? I thought that I was seeing a psychology case , this boy with night terrors . But it 's much worse than that . It stirred up spiritual instincts , I guess . Things I haven 't felt in a long time . MILO : Why do they look like demons ? Like our exact idea of devils ? You know every time you ask me a question , you already have an answer . That 's not true . ( SIGHS ) They look like our idea of devils because they 've been here before . We 've been waiting for them . We knew they were coming , so when they brought about this change , it scared us on some deep level . - Because we could never stop it . - That would imply some kind of - crazy psychic ... - Yes ! Yes ! Psychic connection . People have been writing about this for centuries . I mean , ancient mystics talked about an energy . A relationship between all living things and the stars themselves . Perhaps we 've always known the Overlords were coming . Okay , so because of some crackpot ancient philosophy , we knew they were coming to do good . So then why turn them into the personification of evil ? Mmm . PERETTA : Tom said he was taken here . I know it 's not possible , but that 's what he described . The Overlords , that there is their true colors . But you 've always known that . You 're being melodramatic . Your mother knew it . You used to always see things clearly through her eyes . When did you go blind ? - Please don 't bring up my mom . - She died for her faith . She killed herself because she lost it . Never apologize for your faith . Do you think that the Overlords are attacking this family ? Look at your cross . They 're attacking more than that . Faith is on its last legs . It 's just we don 't see it , 'cause they give us ice cream . ( AMY INHALING ) JAKE : Oh . AMY : There she is . Oh , my gosh . Is that a little hand ? ( GASPS ) - Yeah . - Hi , baby . She 's got a good strong heartbeat . AMY : She 's very pretty . Names , names , names . ( JAKE YELLING AND LAUGHING ) Jane ? Janey ? ( JAKE YELLS ) Oh ! Lauren ? Oh ! ( LAUGHS ) Argh ! JAKE : You are going down ! Und now ve vill soak you viz da Supa-Duper-Soaking Device . - Not me , Dad ! - Ja ? Get her ! Get Jennifer ! Who 's Jennifer ? ( LAUGHS ) ( JAKE YELLS ) Tom just said the strangest thing . Jennifer . What ? I know what to call the baby . Oh . That 's where he got it from . What ? I ... I just thought of it then . Nah , you must 've mentioned it before . It just popped into my head . Divine inspiration . No , Amy . - You mentioned it to Tom . - No , Jacob . I didn 't . Do you like it ? Jennifer . Mmm . This is the problem . We 're gonna live forever but we don 't have enough to do . No wonder we feel like we 're going out of our minds . You 're not going out of your mind . Tom asked me the other day if he 'd ever have a job . I told him he didn 't need one . What kind of a message is that ? We need to reclaim some of what we had when we were kids . - I see where this is going . - Look , I made some calls . Hold those horses . - We 're not moving to New Athens . - Just to visit . To see it . It 's living life the old way . There is crime in New Athens . God , I hope so . And , uh , litter and hot dog stands which are notoriously bad for you . And you love . But you know what else they have ? They have art and they have culture and they 're awake , Amy . It might be good for all of us to remember how things once were , you know , warts and all . Do I seem happier to you ? Yes . Am I still fighting demons in the dark ? No . It 's the baby , baby . She 's going to change everything for us . Yes , Holy Mother . Send thy angels to defend us . All , ye , Holy Angels ... Hey ! - It 's them . - Peretta ? It 's them . The Overlords . - Hey . Turn the dial down . - They ... - What ... What about them ? - Are you hurt ? - What is going on ? - We 're not hurt . I don 't know . I don 't know . - But they were here . - It 's , um , Peretta . - The Overlords were here . - They were here ? Their pod was here watching the house . - What about Tom ? Is Tom all right ? - Hey , hey , calm down . Peretta ! Just keep your voice down . - I don 't want him ... - PERETTA : Well , I 'm not a hysterical person . I am a person with faith . When I was in your house last time , I felt something , and it did this . Well , um , things are much better since that day , uh , Peretta . Tom 's much better actually . And , uh , you bringing it all up again is , uh , just ... It 's going to upset him . There is no such thing as evil , Peretta . - ( SCOFFS ) - AMY : We 're fine . Our family is fine . Come inside , please . JAKE : Yeah . Well , since that day I haven 't been able to stop thinking about it . Tom told me they take him somewhere to a place of fire and smoke ... If this is your idea of counseling - then no wonder it 's a dying profession . - ... and he is scared . Thank you for your spiritual concern , Peretta , but , uh , my son does not take night trips to hell . Thank you . ( DOOR LOCKS ) A paranormal eye to the soul or just a harmless board game ? I 've finalized the guest list . Good . I need to add these people to the guest list . We 're bringing these people all the way out to Africa ? Apparently , this is where the connection is strongest . Connection to what ? Look , just get them here , all right ? The father 's not important , but the mother and the child , they have to be here , do you understand ? - This room was built for them . - Sir , it 's not my place to question , - but can 't you demand that ... - No . You don 't make demands on Karellen . The Overlords are deceiving us . I don 't know why but they are . NEWS ANCHOR : But for now , let 's go back to Haansvelt , Missouri , and the ongoing developments at Ricky Stormgren 's farm , where it seems that the crowds are growing , right ? REPORTER : Yes , as the newly energized Pilgrimage continues to take hold at the Stormgren farm in Missouri , followers and detractors alike are asking the same question . Why would the Overlords allow their prophet to suffer ? There has been a great outpouring of support for Ricky Stormgren since his return home from the Hampstead Hospital , just six months ago . Jake Greggson ? Yeah . My name is Morton . I work for Dr. Rupert Boyce . Rupert Boyce ? I know that name . He wants to redesign his game reserve in the Haansvelt , South Africa . We 're inviting several designers to come visit . I , uh , I do golf courses . A lot of people play golf these days . You don 't fancy a fresh challenge ? That 's a long way to come when you could 've phoned . Well , I had other business in California . ( DOOR OPENS ) MORTON : Hello . You must be Amy . Hi . This gentleman wants to fly me to South Africa for a job interview . Designing , um , a game reserve ? The whole family 's invited . Big party . Kids can see the animals . The other candidates will be there , too . - Sounds amazing . - Yeah . A little too amazing . There aren 't that many guys doing what you 're doing , Jake . You 're special . I 'll think about it . Of course . If you 're not comfortable flying out then that 's fine . Uh , what 's the matter with you ? You say you 're bored out of your mind . He just pitches up and says he 's flying us to Africa ? Come on . What 's the worst that could happen ? Go to a party in a beautiful place . Jake , this is the adventure you 've been looking for , don 't you think ? Hey . Wait . Morton ? - WOMAN : Ellie ? - MAN : Ellie ? ELLIE : Please , just let me get by , okay ? MAN : Can you tell us anything ? Ellie , is there any news ? ELLIE : Just let me through , guys , okay ? MAN : We don 't mean you no harm . If there 's anything we can do to help you , just let us know . Look , it 's just my shopping , okay ? It 's really not that interesting . MAN : Any word ? ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) - Oh , my God . - ELLIE : Please just leave it . Just leave it please . I 'm fine . - PERETTA : It 's fine . Let me help . - I 'm fine . Okay . I 'll get out of your face . I 'm sorry . I 'm impressed . You 're doing great . Can you juggle the apples while you do that , too ? How about this ? I will take the bike , I 'll wheel it to your front door , and then you can frog-march me off your land . ( SIGHS ) Deal . These children , they shouldn 't be here . None of you should . It really doesn 't achieve anything . Oh , I didn 't come with them . I 'm a counselor . I just thought these people seemed a little lost . Like , they might need some support . I mean , you and Ricky , you must feel pretty isolated out here . Thanks . I can , uh , take it from here . " A golden dawn comes shining from the eyes of God . " Wow . ( BEEPS ) - RACHEL : Hey . - Hey . Wanna hear what I found in this text , Corpus Hermiticum ? I love discussing the Corpus Hermiticum on a Saturday night . I mean , what girl doesn 't ? But do you wanna go to the party with me ? I mean , Karellen might be there and everyone else from the center is bringing their significant other . I mean , not that we 're , um ... Uh , yeah . Great . ALL : Run , run , run . PERETTA : Like , side to side . ( ALL YELLING ) ALL : Yay ! ELLIE : Yeah , it can feel like a fortress here . Everybody wants something . A little communion wine ? - Amen . - ( CHUCKLES ) Oh . What is that ? Aguardiente . My mother used to take a drop every Saturday night . ( ELLIE CHUCKLES ) Not too many drops , I hope . I 'm sorry . Is she ... My mom was a missionary . And when Karellen arrived , he killed the need for God . And so she killed herself . Oh , Peretta , I 'm sorry . But I 'm not sure that God ever really helped any of us . ( STAMMERS ) I don 't believe that . He gave us diseases , and when we found cures for those , he created new ones . God was just this black void that we cried into . But only the Overlords answered . But , hey , if God wants to trump Karellen , bring it on . Isn 't there something in the Bible about barren women having children ? If God 's selling , then I 'm buying . You can 't have children ? I should go . Giraffes . It 's a whole herd of them . Elephants . Down there . Do you see them ? Here 's my plus one . Rachel . What 's wrong with me ? Uh ... Nothing . Nothing at all . You look ... Your dress is ... Well , your dress is attractively symmetrical . The way it , uh , yeah . " Attractively symmetrical . " Is that Keats ? No . Who 's Keats ? And look at you . All dressed up to meet an Overlord . What will you do if you see one ? Uh , buy him a drink and ask him some questions ? ( RACHEL GIGGLING ) ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) This is the kokoro symbol . I had a pendant as a kid . Lost it skinny-dipping in Lake Towada . Means love . Oh . Thank you . Uh , I ... I 'll go check your coat . All of this is for an interview ? Excuse me , please . Jake . And family . Pleasure 's all mine . - Thanks so much for coming out all this way . - Hi . And you must be Tom ? We have some exceptionally cool things for you to see . - Are you game ? - Sure . Morton , would you mind escorting this young man to our Exhibit Room ? You are gonna love it . Lions and tigers and bears , oh , my ! Absolutely . Hey , don 't touch anything . It might bite . MORTON : He 'll be fine . So , um , how 'd you wanna play this , Dr. Boyce ? I actually took the liberty of sketching a few ideas . Let 's just enjoy the party , shall we ? Mrs. Greggson , if I may ? Sure . ( CHUCKLES ) I promise I 'll bring her back . WOMAN : Dostoevsky , Orwell , Dickens ' stories came from characters rising above their situation . Who 'd write Hard Times now ? Armistead Maupin wrote about the stigma of being gay . My partner and I can kiss in the street without raising a hair . What the hell would Maupin write about now ? If you guys have a hankering for the past , then I hear the place to go is New Athens . Income tax and homophobia ? Book me a ticket . JAKE : So , you guys don 't design golf courses , do you ? WOMAN : Oh , no . We 're from the World Federation . No kidding . Oh , hey , hey . - Thanks . - Of course . Not your scene either ? Oh , I used to work with these bozos . Don 't knock it . A job 's a rare commodity . Life of leisure , huh ? It 's the dream . Not my dream . Milo Rodricks . All right . Jake Greggson . I actually came here for a job interview . A job ? I think you missed a beat . I mean , Boyce is closing this place down , he 's not taking people on . Not taking people on ? Then why the hell are we here ? I should probably get back inside . Uh , here 's my card . Let me know how it turns out . ( WHIRRING ) ( WHIRRING CONTINUES ) JAKE : Hey . - Tom back ? - Not yet . Look , um ... I don 't think this is about a job interview . I don 't know what it 's about . - You want to get out of here ? - Yeah . I 'll go find Tom . All right , just give me a sec . I 'll be back . What the hell 's up with you ? He 's here . He 's actually here . - Who ? - Karellen . BOYCE : Ladies and gentlemen . ( CLAPS ) If I could have your attention , please . I know we 've all been waiting , so without any further delay , I 'd like to introduce our special guest . I give you the Supervisor for Earth . ( CROWD MURMURING ) ( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) Good evening , everyone . So ... You have solved many of the problems your science was chasing . Disease . Climate change . ( CHUCKLES ) And as a consequence , much of your research is now redundant . Nevertheless , you should be proud of what you have accomplished . - Bravo . - ( APPLAUSE ) Now I know there 's been some concern as to why I acquired so many animals for the Overlords . They are to be shipped to Karellen 's home world as part of a great menagerie , a zoo . They will not be harmed and they will live longer . Supervisor , I wanted to ... - I wanted to ask about the ... - Not now , Rodricks . You 're killing scientific curiosity . I admire the work you have done , but your scientific curiosity has led you dangerously close to forces that you could never have controlled . They would have destroyed you . They saved us from ourselves . Why are we being kept in the dark ? You now have peace and the way has been prepared for your successors . I 'd like to thank everybody who worked on the World Federation Observation Orbital . I 'd like to probably turn that into an acronym as well . ( LAUGHS ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Um , and , uh , please enjoy the rest of the evening . ( CROWD MURMURING ) Mrs. Greggson , I realize this might seem like an odd request but the Supervisor would like to meet with you privately . ( CHUCKLES ) Uh , I 'm sorry , why does he want to meet with me ? I 'm not entirely sure , but if I were you I 'd take it as a compliment . Dinosaurs ruled the world for 200 million years . What happened to them ? I guess they just had their time . Wait a second , I 've been here . - I 've seen these . - Now , hold on , son . I want to find Dad . Just ... Just give them more time . JAKE : More time for what , Mr. Morton ? You 're going to tell me why we 're really here . But first you 're going to let go of my son . We 're not trying to hurt anyone , Jake . Believe me , we just need more time . Like I said , more time for what ? ( BUZZING ) ( GASPS ) Mrs. Greggson , if I could introduce Karellen . Perhaps you could explain to us what the room is for ? Step up onto the platform . I want you to put your hand on the disk . Karellen , I think it would be nice if you could give us an explanation as to what you 're expecting from us . I 'm expecting nothing from you , Dr. Boyce . Amy , trust me . Please do as I ask . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) KARELLEN : You will find a new voice inside you that I can now speak with . You need to trust us . Okay , I want a gyro waiting for us outside right now . Tom , come on . Tom ! KARELLEN : Don 't fight . You 've been fighting from the beginning . She 's not fighting . I 'm not talking to Amy . You cannot protect the Earth . You must accept what you are . BOYCE : I don 't understand what 's happening . I 'm asking you to stop until you explain it to us . KARELLEN : You know who you really are and what you are joined with . So tell me and tell yourself . You are singular and myriad . One and many . Reveal yourself to me . Reveal yourself to me . Karellen . Listen to my voice . ( AMY BREATHING SHAKILY ) You 're trying to be a child . But , you cannot be a child knowing yourself as you do . Tom . KARELLEN : Listen to my voice . This has to stop . Accept who you are . You 're hurting her . BOTH : Don 't touch us ! ( WHIRRING ) ( GROANING ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) TOMMY : I hear you . I 'm coming . ( WHIRRING ) Tom ! Tom , wait ! Tom ! Tom ! Jennifer . She 's awake . No ! ( AMY SCREAMS ) Tom ! ( PANTING ) It is done . She is awake . She accepts and she understands . Now they will follow . Hey , buddy . Hey , hey , Tom ? JAKE : Hey , hey , Tom ? Hey . Tom ? Hey . ( CRYING ) Dad , I 'm so sorry . It 's Jennifer . She 's so strong . No , no , no , no , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Oh , my God . It 's their alphabet . That 's what it is , it stands for their alphabet . Can I ... Sorry . Have you got something to write with , anything like a pen , something ? - I ... Um ... - Lipstick , yeah , that 's perfect . - Oh , that ... - Sorry . It was a connection . What we saw was a conversation between down here and something up there using their language . That 's Herve Leger Red and it 's my favorite . All right , so , each symbol is a letter in their alphabet . And I think that they base their alphabet on constellations . That 's why you draw all over your star charts . I 've charted every letter I can find . This one is new . I recognize the pattern , Rachel . We got to go . Okay . Amy ? AMY : Jake ! - Jake . - Amy . ( CRYING ) Honey ... ( SOBS ) Please , please , can we just go ? JAKE : Okay . Stay away from us . Tom . BOYCE : Why would Karellen want to connect with your unborn child ? Aims , keep walking . What is it you 're carrying ? I saw something , a vision ... I don 't even know . Amy , let 's go . - I don 't ... - Come on . I 'm sorry . What was it I saw , Amy ? ( MOANING ) ( MOANING LOUDLY ) You see ? Now , you see , each symbol is a star system , but none of them can support planetary life , which I found odd . RACHEL : So , this symbol , this letter ... MILO : Only it 's not a symbol . It 's a constellation , the Carina system . And this one is different . It 's the only system with planets . ( CHUCKLING ) ( SCREAMING ) That is the home world of the Overlords . ( CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( GUN FIRING ) Son of a bitch . ( SIGHS ) ( RADIO STATIC ) ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) All right , all right , settle down . - I need to go on through . - No one 's getting through . She 's my friend . She needs me . Call me crazy but I 'd hoped you 'd be back . Well , better to embrace acceptance than hope , Ricky . Well , don 't knock it . It worked . When you disappeared all those years ago , I kind of felt offended . I guess I got used to being pals with God . Whenever you summon God , you want comfort . Yet the very idea of him makes you confused and afraid . He is a stick that you feel you must lean on . But the stick burns . ( HISSES ) On the bench . It is for you . What is it ? Ricky , we have no need to apply our resources to save our own lives . Will it save my life ? This can repair the damage to your body . It 's very difficult to make . This is all there is of it . ( DOOR OPENS ) Forgive me , we should have met sooner . Yes , we should have . It 's been hard , what Ricky has had to do . It 's harder still on the one who has to wait . The one who can only watch but never follow . It is even harder on those who cannot accept . ( DOOR OPENS ) Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , who 's this ? Peretta , what are you doing here ? Whatever it promised you , it is a lie . You lied to them . You lied to us all . They deserve the truth . You made your prophet sick . - RICKY : Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . - They can 't have children . Tell them the truth about what you really are . The truth . The truth is that your illness did not make you sterile . That was my doing . You said that that was from going to the ship . That it was a mistake . No . I have stopped you having children . ( GUN COCKING ) Ellie ? Maybe you don 't know as much as you think about us , Karellen . But you see that we are meant to have children , to raise and to love and to watch grow . Yes . You robbed us of a family , after everything we did for you ! - Hey . - Stop . - Let it go . - ( SOBBING ) No . No , they never wanted what was best for us . They want to destroy us . RICKY : How could you do this ? I sold you to the world . The day is coming , Ricky , when your world will change forever . It will be harder on those who have children . I cannot stop that . We are not masters but merely the servants , but I could spare you the pain of being parents . No . How dare you ! It is not your right to decide ! - No . - Enough ! ( GUN FIRING ) ( GASPING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Oh , my friend . I just wanted to spare you the pain of what is coming . - What 's coming ? - ( GROANS ) Karellen , what happens to the children ? I chose you . Out of all the world ... I chose you . ( BREATHING HOARSELY ) Let it die ! ( INHALES ) ( SOBBING ) Whether I am alive or dead , makes no difference to what is coming . You will never take away my faith . All the world 's religions cannot be right , Peretta . You know that . Your faith is beautiful as poetry is beautiful . But there is no place for it now . You ... You deceived us . No , you have deceived yourselves . No . Nine million species . How did he pick them ? Was it just a random lottery ? Out of a hat ? Who ? Karellen ? Noah , for his Ark . WOMAN : ( WHISPERING ) Peretta . Mom . ( AMY SCREAMING ) NURSE : Push . Hang in there , Amy . Concentrate , come on . Push ! ( SCREAMING ) There you go . That 's it . You 're almost there . Come on . Here we go . One more push , honey . She 's almost here . She 's coming . There we go . JAKE : Oh ! NURSE : There she is . Here 's your baby . It 's your daughter . She 's beautiful . AMY : Jennifer .

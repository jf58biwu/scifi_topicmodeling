 Fuck . He 's dead . - They 're locking the place down . - This was a set-up . The police report came way before she even attacked . - Two more cars on their way . - Picture 's up . - Hey , there 's Riley . - Museum surveillance cameras . Move , move , move ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Sir ! Sir ! Sir ! Stop it right there ! Sir ! Sir , stop ! Please exit the building ! Ready for me ? Please exit the building ! Ma 'am , you have to leave the building . Oh , God ! You have to leave the building . Calm down . - Ma 'am , what 's the problem ? - I saw the terrorist ! - You need to calm down . - He 's attacking the museum ! I saw him ! - You need to calm down ! - Don 't tell me what to do ! What is the world coming to with this meaningless destruction of precious art ? Calm down ! Calm down ! - What is this world coming to ? - Calm down ! Ma 'am , calm down ! Did you see where they went ? That way ! Be careful ! Please ! Be careful , sir ! - Get eyes on back alley . - Copy that . We should get out of the city . - Do not go back to the same place . - I have another safe house ready . - If these work ... - Whispers won 't be able to find us . - But we don 't know what they are . - Croome could have been lying . We should run some basic tests . My friend who 's been supplying drugs has a lab . Good . Let 's do it . What I don 't understand is if that was Whispers ... - It was him . - I thought Croome took Whispers out . He was either lying ... Or someone else brought Whispers back in . Croome could 've been telling the truth about enemies inside BPO . Meaning we lost an ally . But that also means he can 't be the only one . Wolfgang . Sorry I wasn 't there . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . I met someone who I think can help us . Her name 's Lila and ... she 's like us . There are more clusters . I knew it ! The way he was talking about her , she felt like she 'd been around for a while . Which means ... Her cluster has been able to stay free from BPO . Unless they 're working for them . Like Whispers . - Wolfgang , you need to be careful . - I 'll be fine . But give me what you can find on Lila Facchini . Lila Facchini . Got it . Uh ... I know you got some kind of really complicated problem here . And while some people might get a bit freaked out with you talking to empty space all the time , you know , I 'm totally cool with shit like that . And I just ... You know you can trust me , right ? Don 't look at me . Hmm . Interesting . That 's a nice piece . Thanks . Crush your enemies ! That 's , uh , Sanjay , the CI minister . - I 'll go say hello . Be right back . - Okay . - You okay ? - Yeah , fine . Hey , check this out . You like it ? I don 't think I really understand it . Maybe that 's why I like it . Art needs a bit of mystery . Something ... something that resists us . - I 'm Ajay . - Oh , yes . Hello . See ? Works every time . I never understood how obvious it was . There you are ! You met my beautiful bride ? Yes , and for once you haven 't exaggerated . When you 're on that side of the velvet rope , all you want is to be on this side . Gotta piss . I should 've been at your wedding , but business in Seoul prevented me . Of course . But speaking of business , I see you invited Sanjay here . The secret to a rich life , Raj , is dissolving the boundary between business and pleasure . - Um , if you will please excuse me . - Sure . Hi ! Hi . Why bathrooms ? How are you ? Fine . You ? I got a new job . I got a promotion . Being the wife of the owner has its perks , I guess . Rajan respects the work I do . He believes women should be in high positions of power . Hm ... Well , I gotta piss . Wolfgang . Why is it like this ? Why is it so hard ? Why can 't it be like that day when I was in the temple and in the cafe in the rain ? Why is it that I can 't talk to the only person ... I ever felt I could say anything to ? Because ... you deserve to be happy . Wolfgang ... Hello , sexy . Wolfgang ? What if I don 't want to be happy ? Is someone with you ? What if I want something else ? Whoever she is , you really want her , don 't you ? I know I shouldn 't say this ... I know it isn 't right to even think it , but ... This could be fun . What if I 'm only pretending to be a good person ? And deep down I 'm just ... Ah ... - This is where you 've been hiding , huh ? - No , I , you know , was just ... Um ... So tell us , what do you think of that wicked man , Ajay Kapoor ? Is she gone ? Pity . What are you doing here ? Hanging out . Bored . Who are you waiting for ? And here everything was going so perfectly superficial . I 'm just trying to understand why someone like you is working for Fuchs . He 's like any sapien . A temporary solution to a long-term problem . BPO . - How do you avoid them ? - You don 't . But they 're not hunting you . - No . - You made some kind of deal with them . Smart boy . How 's it work ? Same as everything else in the world . Figure out what you want and decide how far you 're willing to go to get it . What do you want ? Everything . Gotta run , lover boy . Whoa ! Wow . Wait , so ... like , your brain is , like , part of a bigger brain and it 's all networked and file-sharing and ... Holy shit , Nom . I thought this trans new-body-now-a-hottie thing was cool , but this ? This ... other-secret-species thing ... Shit . That 's , like , the coolest thing I ever heard . Okay ... but , please , don 't talk about it . This is serious , Bug . Of course it 's serious . This is capital letters B-I-G . As in Galileo . Time to rethink geocentrism . I don 't think I 'm gonna sleep for a week . Was that a mistake ? Same idea . I couldn 't sleep . I haven 't felt this awake in a very long time . Good . It is not every day you escape prison . Thank you again . I wouldn 't be alive if you hadn 't helped me . Those men who attacked you , they were hired by your brother ? Good . Why good ? Because ... he must be very afraid of you to do something like that . I 'm sure when he hears you have escaped , he 's going to piss himself . I have met strong women before . But ... none of them were like you . Soo-Jin said you have a heart as soft as a baby bird . It was what made me like you the moment we met . Part of me wants you to find your brother and make him pay for what he has done . I know that part of me would enjoy your revenge . Whatever you do , child ... do not let it be at the cost of your beautiful heart . This kind of polyphony requires an abandonment of self so that I can release the boundary or loosen the boundaries of that self while writing so I can become someone else temporarily , imaginatively . We just listen to so many voices where we 're exposed to so many more different people than even our parents were . We get more images in a single week than people a hundred years ago would 've seen possibly in their lifetimes . Well , well , well . Let me guess . You 're here to interview the real deal . You know , as a journalist , you probably can sense that that guy in there is just a pretty boy I hired . - Yeah , I had a feeling . - You had a feeling . Ah ! Yeah . - Hello . - Hi . - The nature of the textual intercourse ... - Ah . There you go . Is , uh ... God , I just want to eat them up . I can 't believe I 'm not there . This is so stupid . Two of our favorite writers and I 'm stuck on a boat . What are you doing here ? Well , the video of our recording has already hit over a million views . The TV station has never seen anything like it . So , my boss , Kobi Kihara , was wondering if we could do a follow-up story on you . Do you believe in happy endings ? What ? I couldn 't hear . Someone asked if they believe in happy endings . Miraculously , yes . - Uh-oh . I gotta go . - Wait ! - Gotta help behind the counter . - No . Did they ... Love you . Do I believe in happy endings anymore ? Help ! Is this the first time you 're coming back since ? Me , too . Come on . Van Damn ! Van Damn ! Van Damn ! This is all new . Yes . Van Damn ! Ever since Mr. Rasal 's Anti-Idolatry bill was passed , there 's been a lot of trouble in the temple , ma 'am . It got worse when Guru Yash was arrested . Manendra believed that 's necessary for the long-term good . On Van Damn . - Ken . What 's going on ? - The bastard raised the prices again . Most of my people can 't afford it anymore . This is terrible . We all come here for the same reason . I don 't think that 's true . We obey no law but his law ! You are either with us or against us ! There is no middle ground ! If we do not stop them , they will close our temples ! And destroy our country ! Hey ! You can have it when you pay for it ! Oh , the famous Van Damn . These people need water . Water is life . Water is a commodity . And every commodity has a price . - One truth ! - One truth ! - Our truth ! - Our truth ! One truth ! Our truth ! I mean , the idea of polyphonic fiction reflecting both the intercontextuality of an author 's work and their life really resonated with what is happening to you . You mean to us . It is impacting us both , but how it does is different . Oh , shit . - What ? - I think he 's back . - Bendix ? - Uh-huh . Probably figured out I 'm not at the Women 's Shelter anymore . - I don 't want to lead him to the boat . - What are you gonna do ? Lose him . One truth ! Our truth ! Neets ! - I know you ! I know you ! - You 're not one of us ! No , we should get out of here . The devil ! She 's the devil ! Toilet paper gets stuck to your fucking shoe . You step on it with the other foot and then it sticks to your other foot and then it takes for-fucking-ever to get rid of it . - Where are you ? - Oh ! I 'm sorry . Oh ! Did something else happen ? Something 's always happening . Something happened to the cluster ? There was a protest in India , a riot over water in Nairobi . But mostly I was just worried about you . Oh ! God . You are having a major bad day . I don 't want to complain because Bug is our total hero ... but I think I 'm going a little crazy on this boat . I know . Me , too . Oh ! Money . Power . Property . Those are the real drugs . They suck out every drop of humanity . Speaking of dehumanizing drugs , this is my friend Puck . He 's one of the best chemical engineers I 've ever met . No , we haven 't met . I am a big fan , though . I 've listened to your set at the Berghain many times . Thank you . He 's never stayed more than a day or two with me , but this ... this little mystery seems to have caught his attention . That is a pretty piece of chaining . Effective ligand . Can I ask where you got it ? I 'm sorry , but I can 't tell you . Um , did you find anything trackable or toxic in it ? Well , that depends on your definition of toxic . It 's an androgen booster . Which would inhibit the entactogens . Exactly . It 's the opposite of something like DMT . Blocking empathic synaptic connection , rather than exciting it . - And bonding ... - the inhibitor to the neural proteins . Impressive . Are they teaching bio-chem at DJ school now ? Uh , do you think you could run some basic reactivity tests to my blood ? Yeah , let me get a syringe . I 've missed you . It 's good to catch up . So who is this guy ? No . Maybe just an old friend . I really appreciate your help . She said he was an artist . Nice lab for an artist . Hey ... I think maybe he was a lover . I wasn 't going to say anything , but I know a little about what 's going on . I know you 're in some kind of trouble . Can I help ? No , I don 't think so . Do we really think we can trust this guy ? He could 've called the police by now . I don 't really like him . I think he 's kind of sexy . But ... Can I ask you , are you in town to do a show here in Amsterdam ? - Yes , she is . - What ? Or at least I 'm hoping she is . You know , Vincent mentioned that you had a few legal issues . Uh , nothing serious . Your show could be posted or Periscoped last minute . - Periscoped ? What ? - Instant invite . No . That 's not happening . I have friends who could make sure you 're kept safe . It 's far too dangerous . No , I don 't think it 's possible . Well , you better watch out for this guy 'cause he will talk you into and out of anything . Puck prefers to live differently than me . " King of the ostriches . I 've lived so long with my head buried , I should be able to breathe sand by now . " I know that line . It 's from The Price of Life is Death . - Yes . - Puck loves cheesy movies . Cheesy ? I don 't like him either . You were right . Three , two , one . Hey , guys , we 're so glad you could join us on this beautiful day . We have a very special guest indeed . His name is Capheus Onyango , though he is better known as Van Damn , after the matatu which he drives . Do we have a picture ? Looking good . Van Damn . So , first of all , Capheus , welcome to the show . Thank you , Miss Kihara . It is a very big honor for me to be here . Very kind of you to say , and " Kobi " is just fine . We don 't stand on ceremony here . Now when we started researching this story , we asked ourselves , " Who was this matatu driver ? Where did this guy come from who commands so much respect from his community ? " I was born in a small village outside Nakuru . I understand that grassroots activism actually runs in your family ? Your father was involved in setting up a tea planters union in the 1990s ? That 's true . I was only a young boy , so I don 't remember very much . Those familiar with the story of those terrible strikes will understand the tragedy of what happened to your father . Yeah . My father was killed during one of the riots . - I 'm sorry , Capheus . - Thank you . Would you say that this tragic incident is what powers your desire for social justice ? To be truthful , the thought has never occurred to me until now . Maybe so . But surely the desire for justice lives in all of us . Few of us are willing to risk it just as you did last week . One of our reporters was in your matatu and captured this extraordinary event . Can we roll the tape ? - Van Damn ! Van Damn ! - Unbelievable . Wow . This very brave young man diffused an angry incident that threatened to get much worse . Kibera has been a deprived neighborhood for forever . Why has this anger reached fever pitch now ? Water . Think what we all need water for . We cannot live without water . What do you pay for a liter of water that is packed to your home , Miss Kobi ? Hm ? We both know that it is much less than what people in Kibera pay . Kibera has been represented at the National Assembly by Mr. Mandiba for the last three terms . Do you think the problem is a political one ? Look , who am I to answer such a question ? I drive a bus . If I didn 't take people where they hired me to take them ... I wouldn 't expect them to get back on my bus . We expect leaders to take us where we want to go . The problem , it seems to me , begins when they don 't . When things do not improve and yet these leaders keep expecting us to get on their bus ... I think this is when leaders become something else . What ? Politicians . - It 's a beautiful day , Mrs. Rasal . - It is , Mr. Bhoopalam . Mrs. Rasal . Hello . Who are you ? - Who is this ? - New security . Vikram , ma 'am . I 'm in charge of keeping your family safe . The elevator is waiting . This way . - Six months ... - Rajan ? Rajan ? Why is there a security man with a machine gun following me ? I tried to call you , but your phone has been switched off . - Mr. Singh . - Namaste , Mrs. Rasal . I 'm Agent Singh from the National Intelligence Bureau . Over the past week or two , we 've received several death threats aimed at your father-in-law , his company and family . I didn 't want to concern you unduly , darling . This morning we intercepted an explosive device addressed to your husband . Oh , my God ! What ? The police laughed at it because it was so poorly made . Nevertheless , the government has insisted to provide your father-in-law 's family round-the-clock security . For how long ? Until such time as god-intoxicated maniacs are not plotting to kill us , Kala . It 's for your own protection , ma 'am . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Thank you . Excuse me . - You said you live with your parents ? - Relax . No one 's going to walk in on us . Why did you call me ? Let me try and answer that question for you . There are people you meet in your life ... and ... for no logical reason , you feel immediately connected to . But in fact , there 's actually a scientific explanation . I know . I just couldn 't help myself . You talking to me ? Señor ? Señor Pasquale ? My name is Lito Rodriguez . I 'm an actor . So ? I knew your son , Raoul . He interviewed me years ago . Yes . I know your face . Raoul found your movies ... Cheesy ? No . You underestimate yourself . Come , come . Please . Raoul was always different . Even when he was very young . We were a family of journalists ... my wife , Raoul , me . Thank you . The truth was not a thing to be hidden or denied . Not under our roof . But to hunt for truth , you need a sixth sense for it . Journalistic intuition . In my 40 years , I never knew anyone with an intuition like my son . You and Raoul were lovers ? Well , um ... Wait , I ... I want to let you know that I 'm ... I 'm not gay . Okay ? I ... I 'm ... Wait , wait . I just think that ... as an actor , it is important to be open to all kinds of experiences . Sure . It was just ... Yes . - Hm . - Journalistic intuition ? Well , let 's just say ... you are my son 's type . Um ... Señor Pasquale ... Can I ask about his disappearance ? I know he went to Chicago for a story . Do you know anything about it ? He said it was the biggest story of his career . Perhaps the biggest story of the decade . Come on , Mrs. Cho , it 's the police . Sh ! Come on , Mrs. Cho . It 's too early in the morning to kick the door in , isn 't it ? My son 's room . It hasn 't changed much . Homes are architectural forms of memory . Since he disappeared , I haven 't been able to come in here . These are his photographs . That 's the cabin . We need to know where these pictures were taken . Do you know where these pictures were taken ? Um ... somewhere in California . The woman in the picture was important to the story . And to him . Can you take pictures of all of this stuff and send it to me ? Do you mind if I take pictures ? Do you know her ? Her name is Angelica . When my son was disappeared , the police said he was involved with drugs . Hm . I knew they were lying . When they came here , they were looking for something . They did not find it . You see ? My son believed his secrets would be safe with you . And they were . Well , hello . Oh , hi . Yeah . Uh , Detective Mun , from Seoul Metropolitan Police . A real detective ? Oh ! Here ? Heavens . We just have some questions . Oh , my , my ! What 's all this about ? Actually , one of your neighbors found these prison uniforms - in your garbage bag this morning . - Oh ... Familiar , are they ? Yeah , of course they are . They used to be mine . The uniforms have numbers , Mrs. Cho . So you can just drop the innocent old lady act . I know you won 't mind us searching your apartment . I know you won 't mind showing me your warrant . One of the escaped convicts was a Min-Jung . You and she were cellmates , weren 't you ? The only thing I hate more than rhetorical questions ... stupid rhetorical questions . Harboring fugitives , Mrs. Cho ... that 's a serious crime . I don 't want to have to put you back in prison . Yeah . They were here . Okay . But they left last night . You can search the place if you don 't believe me . You 're a reporter . You must have watched this . Of course . But I don 't understand what it means . Maybe you can explain it to me . That 's Todd . One of Angelica 's cluster . This is the origin of their zombie factory . Means Kolovi knew about it from the beginning . These are early experiments of the men who I believe are responsible for your son 's disappearance . That one is Professor Kolovi . I showed him a picture of my son and he denied ever meeting him . What did your journalistic intuition tell you about him ? He 's a lying snake who would open his own mother 's throat if he could profit by it . When was the last time he spoke to Raoul ? When was the last time you spoke to Raoul ? I believe he called me just before he vanished . Yes ? Hello ? Hello ? Raoul ? Raoul , is it you ? Where are you ? Listen ... I love you . I don 't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest . But he obviously thought highly of you . I hope one day I share that same opinion . - Do you know where they were headed ? - No . Would you tell me if you did know , huh ? I 'll assume that 's another one of your rhetorical questions . Yeah , yeah . Back up , Mrs. Cho . Jun ? Jun ? Ms. Bak ! Ms. Bak ! Stop ! Don 't move ! Put your hands up ! I said hands up ! Good . Look ... we don 't want anybody to get hurt , right ? Stay still . Stay still . Good . Stay still . Okay . Uh ! Who are you ? You 're her . Oh ! I think he 's sleeping . Wow ! That was better than any movie or TV show . We should go . This taste of freedom was delicious . But enough is enough . - No . - I will only slow you down . Besides , what else can they do to me ? I 'm serving life . I need you . Go . Go clear your name . You and your imaginary friends . And when you find your brother , pound him a few times for me . - Yeah , me too . - Mm ! When you 're free , come visit me . I will . Angelica , you 're being irrational . They want to sterilize us . - It 's a voluntary procedure . - For now . Even with everything we 've been through , your first , your only thought , is for yourself . - Come with me . - Please , listen to me . I don 't want to waste any more time listening to your excuses . Fuck . That 's it ! I 'm done . I 'm done with you , I am done with them . I 'm done with all of it . Angelica , be reasonable . I don 't want to talk about it anymore . Where do you think you 're going ? Chicago . Are we dreaming the same dream ? Look , going to Chicago is suicide ! It 's not a dream . I 'm sorry . It 's a memory . I don 't need your tears . I need your fucking courage . Will . Help him . Jonas . What 's happening ? There 's something wrong . It 's Jonas . I 've come to say goodbye . I thought I had value to them , but it seems that time has passed . What 's happening ? They 're gonna kill him . They 're using me to send you a message . They want you to watch . We have to do something . Oh , my God . This can 't happen . I 'm sorry I failed you . - Angelica . - I 'm here . I love you . I love you . The only lips I 've ever wanted to kiss in my life . Angelica , I 'm afraid . I 'm here .

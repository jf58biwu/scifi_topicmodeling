 [ narrator ] previously on dark matter . [ three ] who are you ? [ one ] we all woke up just like you . No idea who we are or how we got here . [ six ] we 're nothing but a bunch of low life mercenaries . One of the dreams she experienced was of one of u , Sabotaging the stasis pods . [ weapon charging up ] [ six ] what 's inside ? [ five ] secrets . How do you think the rest of the crew will react When they find out that you 're an impostor ? [ jace ] who are you and what the hell are you doing with my ? This is ridiculous . We 're the most wanted criminals in the galaxy And we can 't even scrape togethr enough money to buy a decent me . [ six ] well , we could if you hadn 't lost those weapons . We were ambushed . It wasn 't our fault . So you keep saying . Alright , there 's no point in arguing . There 's nothing we can do about it now . Sure there is . We do what we do best ... Rob so . [ three chuckles ] Anyone in particular ? I say ferrous corp . We find their closest outpost , and we just nail it ... Hard . They 're already pissed off at us , right ? How much worse could it be ? What do you think ? I think it 's a terrible- - [ three coughing ] Sorry , wrong pipe . You were saying ? Sure , it 's what we do , right ? Yeah . What about the vault ? What vault ? I think that 's what it is . It 's down in the lower levels , At the end of a maintenance shaft . I found it when i was exploring the vents . [ two ] this is the door you saw in your dream , isn 't it ? [ five ] yeah . [ six ] well if i were a pirate a , and apparently i am , This is the kind of place i might just pick to hide my lo . [ two ] has anyone else been down here before ? [ three ] no , definitely not me . Alpha-numeric lock code . Which none of us can remember . You ever dream about the code , kid ? No . But it 's still rattling around in your head isn 't it ? [ one ] what do you want to do , crack her skull open ? Dig around with a spoon ? Believe me , if i thought that would help- - [ five scoffs ] [ android ] two , come in please . Go ahead . [ android ] i think you should all come up to the bridge immediate . We 're receiving a transmission . From who ? Someone who says he knows you . [ android ] the signal 's weak this far from the nearest g-com . There may be some interference . [ two ] okay . I should warn you : He seems to e a man of little patience and ta . Ah . Portia lin et al . Thanks for keeping me waiting . Your android , a little testy , b , You might want to check that out . [ android confused ] i thought i was nothing but pat . Is there something we can do for you ? [ man laughing ] Is there something they can- - you hear that ? There was , definitely something you could do for me , your job . The one i set up for you ? With ferrous corp ? The one you completely messed up ? This ringing any bells ? ! There were unforeseen circumstances . [ woman ] babe , have you seen my inhaler ? No , i haven 't seen your inhaler ! I 'm on the phone ! This is interstellar , you have any idea How much this costing me ! Get outta here ! [ man inhales ] [ man coughing ] [ man clears chest ] Anyway , where were we ? Oh right , you were talking about How you were gonna make it up to me . Were we ? I didn 't think- - Let me bottom line this for you , okay ? Ferrous wants your heads . Without their backing you 've got no political protect , Which , given your records , i think we can all agree , Is not a good thing . But it 's okay . I 'm gonna take care of it , i 'm gonna smooth things over . And in exchange , you 're gonna do a job for me . What kind of job ? Oh walk in the park . Salvage job , nothin ' to it . Which is why you 're gonna do it for half of your normal rate . [ three ] no way . [ android ] it 's a freighter , iss far horizon . It apparently suffered some kind of catastrophic system failure , The resulting explosion exposed most of the upper decks to spac . None of the crew survived . Unfortunately , the data stream provided by your friend Was a little short on information . I don 't think he 's our friend . [ six ] he 's a handler . He gets the jobs , we do the job . Like an agent . [ three ] i don 't know , guy seems like a scumbag to me . What ? I 'm not allowed to have standards ? The thing i don 't get is why us ? Why not hire some licensed salvage operation to do the job ? [ two ] if i had to guess , there 's something illegal on th . Stolen goods , drugs , who knows ? Something valuable ? Can we trust him ? Well , we have worked with him before- - We need him . Without our memories , we have no other connections . We 're completely on our own . Am i wrong ? [ two ] we 're nine hours out from the freighter 's last known loca , So everyone get some sleep . [ door slides open ] Oh , h-hi . Um , i just came by to see if you wanted to um ... [ three groans ] Hey . If you wanted to go over the plans , for the salvage . Oh , sure . Why don 't we go up to the bridge and we 'll go over it . Are you coming ? Yeah . [ android ] as far as we know , the ship 's ftl drive is intact , But navigation from the bridge is impossible . If we can establish a remote lik in the engineering section , I might be able to upload a jump sequence from here . The ship will fly itself to its original destination . [ one ] you do know the guns are just a precaution , right ? The ship 's abandoned . There might be rats . I hate rats . [ two ] android , come in . [ android ] i 'm reading you . Go ahead . [ two ] we 're in . Life support 's operational , but . It 's a little cold in here . [ android ] the ship is operating on emergency power only , But i estimate at least six hous Before life support shuts down completely . That should be more than enough time . Understood . We 'll head to engineering now . [ three ] i think we should look around a little first . We came here to do a job . You said it yourself , there might be some nice , Tasty contraband kicking around here somewhere . Which they want back . That 's why they hired us . Half the ship 's exposed to spac . Who 's gonna be surprised If there 's a little contraband that goes missing ? Am i right , hmm ? Yeah . Absolutely . [ six ] you know , after our fuel cost We 're barely making a profit he . Maybe we should at least take a look . [ two ] alright , fine . I 'll head down to engineering , and hook up the link . I should be 45 minutes- - hour m . When i 'm done , we 're leaving . [ three ] yes boss . [ three chuckles ] ¶ suspenseful music ¶ ¶ suspenseful music ¶ ¶ suspenseful music ¶ ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ four ] how 's it going ? [ android ] they 've gained access to the sh . So far , so good . Okay . Well in the meantime , Do you think i can drag you away for a sec ? I highly doubt that . Despite your low center of grav , You possess neither the strength nor the stamina To pull my body weight over any significant distance . No , i mean could you help me with something ? Of course . I , on the other hand , possess the strength And stamina to convey you with great ease . No dragging required . Whoa . No i just need your help with something in the infirmary . No heavy lifting . Okay . Where did you find this ? It was in that storage room , where i found the dead boy . Did you find anything else ? No . I thought it was just data storage , But i 've tried everything , i can 't read it . I 'm not surprised , because it 's not data storage . Then what is it ? Curious . The molecular structure is similar to that Of a subatomic matrix card , but on a much smaller scale . What does that mean ? If i had to guess , i would say this is part Of some larger system designed to Access pockets of extra-dimensional space . Why would somebody want to do that ? I ask myself that question all the time . Rarely do i get a satisfactory answer . [ five sighs ] right . Thanks anyways . Do me a favor , don 't tell any of the others about this , okay ? I thought you had resolved to trust them . Well , some of them anyway . Yeah , so did i . [ banging ] [ three ] empty . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ clanging ] [ creaking ] [ three ] what the hell is that ? [ creaking ] I think the other side of this wall is exposed to space . Could be pressure or temperature difference Causing the metal to warp . Maybe this isn 't such a good id . Quit being such a wimp . Gah ! Sonuva- - ! [ rat squeaking ] Little bastard . Huh , what 'd i say ? I hate rats . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ box clicks open ] ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ keyboard keys clicking ] [ computer humming up ] [ two ] alright guys , i 'm in . I found a junction box with access to the ftl control . How 's it going on your end ? [ six ] standby . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ six ] i think we found somethin . Is that blood ? Looks fresh . [ two ] what are you- - what 're you talking about , six ? How could that be ? Answer me ! Who 's blood ? [ four ] i think it was most likely theirs . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ six ] we 've got four dead bodies here . [ two ] this whole section is sti . How did they die ? I don 't think it was an accident . [ four ] it was a violent attack . Not with conventional weapons . Whoever did this used their bare hands ... And teeth . I-i 'm sorry , did you say " teeth ? Correct . Okay , that 's it . Fall back to my position . We 'll finish hooking up the link and get the hell out of here . One and three , do you copy ? One and three , are you reading ? [ one ] we 're getting a lot of interference over the radio . Could be residual radiation from the explosion . [ three ] so ? So i 'm not a fan of radiation . We should head back . Nah , not yet . This ship has yet to give up it 's riches . Do we have to have this talk again ? Remember that i am not the one who had his face Surgically altered so that he could infiltrate our crew . It doesn 't prove anything . Maybe not . But it sure does make you wonder though , doesn 't it ? How long are you gonna hold this over me ? I don 't think that far ahead . Well just remember , when you 're blackmailing someon , You need to be really careful not to push them too far . I know . That 's what i thought . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ computer buzzing ] [ banging ] Six , is that you ? [ growling ] [ two grunting ] [ two grunting and panting ] [ schwing ] [ monster growls ] [ two ] ahhh ! [ two grunting and panting ] [ multiple shots fired ] [ two panting ] [ six growls ] [ multiple shots fired ] [ six ] goddamn ! What the hell was that ? [ two ] i don 't know . He came out of nowhere . [ six ] let me take a look . [ two panting ] It 's a nasty gash . Android , come in . [ android ] go ahead . [ keyboard keys clacking ] I 've established the link . Can you access the ship 's logs ? I believe so . [ two ] then do it . We need to find out what the hell 's going on here . [ android ] i don 't understand . Is something wrong ? [ two ] yeah , you could say that . [ one ] this is ridiculous . If there is any contraband on this ship , It 's be gonna be hidden , right ? Behind the walls , under the floors , It 's not going to be in plain sight . Ahh trust me . I 've got a nose for this kind of thing . Yeah ? How do you know ? Well , you assume because you 're not the real jace corso , That you 're not a criminal , rig ? How do you know ? Okay , fine . But while we 're having this frank discussion ... Mhmm ? What the hell happened between you and two ? I think it was pretty obvious , isn 't it ? You get her drunk ? No but i totally would have . No , in fact , she came on to me . And it wasn 't subtle , either . Practically an order . You know , she does like to be in charge . I wouldn 't think you were her type . Let me guess , you thought you were ? I got news for you pretty boy . With a woman like that , that whole sensitive Nice-guy thing you got going on doesn 't cut it . We 'll see . [ three chuckles ] yeah we 'll see . [ six ] he was a crewman . At least he was before he turned into that . [ four ] it 's possible he 's the one who killed the others . By himself , against four people ? No weapons ? [ two ] hey you didn 't have to fight him off . I believe it . Still , we can 't assume he 's the only one . Whatever happened to him May have happened to the other crew members . One and three , come in . [ radio static ] Guys , please respond . There may be a potential threat onboard the ship . Do you copy ? [ radio static ] Damnit . Raza to boarding party , come in please . Go ahead . [ android ] it appears most of the freighter 's command logs wee Destroyed in the explosion , however i did manage to salvage A portion of the audio report by the first officer . [ recording ] ... At first we belit to be a series of random attack . ... Violent behavior and signs ... Possible contagion Has no idea where ... Now cern it is not an airborne pathogen , But more likely ... And blood . [ six ] can you enhance that last part any more ? Give me a moment . Standby . [ recording ] ... More likely transmitted by fluids Such as saliva and blood . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ six ] okay , we 're not gonna panic . We just need more information . Android , i want you to sift through every scrap of data You can salvage from this ship . See if the infirmary survived the explosion And tap into those logs . Scanning now . In the meantime , we 've gotta get two back to the ship . She needs medical attention . Understood . [ four ] we can 't do that . You heard the recording . It 's a contagion . She 's been bitten . We don 't know anything for sure . [ two ] no , no . He 's right . If i go back there the same thing that happened here Could happen on the raza . We don 't know what happened here . All we have are fragments of a partial report . She said it was a possible contagion , That might have been transferred by contact . She said it was " likely . " Whatever . Even if you are infected , Maybe there 's something we can do about it . Maybe there 's a treatment , if we can catch it soon enough . That 's a lot of maybes . What 's the alternative ? We just leave her here ? Life support 's gonna fail in less than six hours . Yeah well it 's a merciful end , compared to that one . We 're not leaving anyone behind . Well that 's not up to you . [ android ] may i offer a suggest ? [ two ] go ahead . The ship 's infirmary is equipped with an isolation chamber . It would be more than adequate for quarantine purposes . And once you 're inside , we can scan for the presence Of any known viruses in our medical database . Short of simply waiting for symptoms to appear , It 's the only way to know for sure . What about one and three ? [ six ] i 'll come back and get ' em . I 'm not taking no for an answer . Let 's go . [ gun cocks ] Alright , we 're enroute . I 'll prep the isolation chamber . And we 've been having trouble With radio communications on the freighter . There must be some kind of interference . See if you can figure out what 's causing it . Understood . [ four ] there may not be interference . It 's possible they 're not respog because they were also attacked And are either dead or incapacitated . That 's what i like about you , Always looking on the bright side . I 'm realistic . Those two can handle themselves . I 'd be more worried about them attacking each other . Good point . Good point . [ one ] why does this corridor look familiar ? [ three ] i don 't know what you 're talking about . We 've been here before . We 're going in circles . Don 't be ridiculous . I have a very keen sense of direction . And don 't ask me how i know that ! This is great . We 're out of radio contact , and we 're lost . We 're fine . You 're an idiot . And you 're an arrogant sonofabitch you know that ? Excuse me ? Yeah , you play all humble , But deep down you think you 're better than the rest of . You think we 're scum bags , and somehow you 're different . Well , maybe not all of you . You 're always going on about the " team " And how we gotta help each other out . Well , i 'm here trying to put food on our table . What are you doing exactly ? Alright , look , i admit , i haven 't exactly been exactly- - Shut up . What , you 're not even gonna let me talk ? I 'm trying to tell you- - I hear something . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ groaning ] You hear that ? Hold up . One , two , three . Hello ? Are you okay ? [ growling ] What the hell ? [ rapid gunshots ] bang , bang , bang Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , easy with that thing . What did you want me to do , Offer her a drink with the humam she was munching on ? Huh ? This ship is already full of holes , Let 's not make anymore if we can help it . [ one panting ] [ five ] are you alright ? Well , i guess we 're gonna find out . Now what ? [ android ] beginning the scan . There are several thousand known viruses And bacteriological agents in the database . This may take some time . And what if this isn 't in the database ? If she starts to turn , i 'll take care of it . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ one ] the crew of this ship is supposed to be dead . They are definitely not supposed to be diseased , cannibal monste . I would 've remembered that . [ three ] i ... Never should 've trusted that scumbag . Great , another dead end . What happened to your amazing sense of direction ? Who could concentrate with all your whining ? Looks like we 'll have to go back . Back ? Where they came from ? I don 't think so . I 've seen five do this , how hard can it be ? [ banging ] Ugh . Whoa , whoa . How do we know that on the other side of this door It 's not exposed to space ? Metal 's not cold . There 's gotta be life support on the other side . [ zombie monster growling ] You better hurry up with that . [ rapid gunshots ] bang , bang , bang A little girl could do that ! What 's your problem ? ! Not helping ! [ rapid gunfire ] bang , bang , bang [ air whooshes ] [ rapid gunfire contines ] I got it ! Let 's go ! Oh crap . What did i say about bullets ! [ one and three grimacing ] [ air whooshing ] [ one ] grab my hand ! [ three panting ] i can 't ! I 'm slipping ! On three ... One , two , three ! [ one and three grunting ] [ buttons clicking on ] [ android ] six , this is the bridge . Go ahead . I 've found the source of the interference . As we suspected , it 's residual radiation From the explosion that destroyed the upper decks . One and three must be somewhere in the affected area . The levels are non-toxic , but it 's greatly reducing The range of their comms . I 'll take a slow pass over that section , see if i can raise ' em . Android , this is four , i 'm in the infirmary . You 'd better get down here . [ one panting ] oh . [ three ] alright , we 'd better get going . No . I 'm not going anywhere . Not until we come up with a plan . We gotta get back to the airlock . The airlock is on the other side of that breach , genius . We 'll find another one . And how do you wanna let the others where to come pick u ? Or do you just wanna open the door and jump over to the r ? Fine . What 's your brilliant plan ? I don 't know yet . I need a second . And you 're welcome , by the way . What ? What , for that ? Really ? Fine . Thank you . This makes us even . Let 's not go crazy , huh . It doesn 't matter . I don 't care anymore . If we make it back , you can tell them whatever you want . You want to take your chances with the others , be my guest . I mean , five , she 's a couple short of a deck , And no one really cares what she thinks anyway . And six , i don 't really know what i think about him . But four , watch out for that gu . He 'll slit your throat in your sleep . Two would understand . Would she ? You sure about that ? Hmm ? I was afraid of this . [ five ] what is it ? Using navigational inputs recorded By the freighter 's ftl computer , I was able to extrapolate their last port of call . The far horizon went somewhere it was not authorized to go . [ two ] where ? [ android ] a planet called taurian alpha . It was the site of a pharmaceutical research facil , But it 's now under galactic quarantine . I 'm guessing something went wrong with the research . The trees on taurian alpha live for tens of thousands of years . It was thought their chemical structure could be used To synthesize a drug that would effectively Make human beings immortal . Instead , they created one of the most deadly viruses Humankind has ever seen . [ four ] why would the ship go there ? [ two ] somebody spent billions on that research . [ android ] it was run by a division of traugott corporat . Yeah , they 're not just gonna let that go . Sure , officially they abide by the quarantine . Unofficially , they send someonen to smuggle out whatever they ca , Then continue their research again somewhere else . Well , they didn 't get very far . How long do i have ? Typically , symptoms appear within three hours of exposure . And i assume there 's no cure . I 'll continue to search the database . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ Hey . Hey ! What 's the hell 's going on ? I think we both passed out . The air 's getting thin in here . It is getting hard to breathe . We lost a lot of pressure during the breach . We 'll have to slow our breathing . Yeah . And maybe talk a little less . One , three , this is six , come in . [ radio static ] One , three , this is six , come in . Six , we 're reading you . Where are you ? I 'm just outside the ship , in the marauder . I can 't be far from your positi . What 's your situation ? It 's kind of a long story . Does it involve flesh-eating crewmen ? So you know about them . It 's some kind of infection . Looks like two 's been exposed . Your signal 's getting stronger . I 'll zero in on it , then see if i can find you an exit point . Hold on . [ four ] are you sure you want to wait until it begins ? I can give you an honorable death before it comes to that . [ five ] are you serious ? I 'd rather have a dishonorable life . [ four ] and you did , by all accounts . I don 't feel any different . I don 't feel anything . I think there 's been a mistake . The scan confirmed the presence of the virus . There is no mistake . Look , if it was me , i would want to go While i still had my wits about me , and in control . Not yet . [ six ] alright guys , i should be right outside your position . I can see a small hull breach . [ one ] yeah , that was us . We had a little ... Accident . We sealed it off though . [ six ] alright , i can see anothe , looks like it 's intact . It 's two levels down and about 100 meters aft . You think you can find it ? Do we have a choice ? You may have to move deeper in the ship to find a way down . May lose radio contact , but i 'll dock and i 'll wait for . Understood . We 're on our way . [ android ] marauder , this is the raza . Go ahead . Did you find them ? Yeah , they were right where you said they 'd be . Then we have a problem . What ? My readings indicate that life support In that section is failing . Oxygen levels are critical . If you don 't get them out in the next ten minutes , They 'll suffocate . [ six ] one , three , come in . [ radio static ] Guys come in we 've got a problem . [ keyboard keys clacking ] The freighter has emergency life support , Including o2 tanks located in various parts of the ship , But so far i 've been unable to link up to that system . Well , keep trying . I 'm heading to the airlock now . Understood . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ I don 't want you to die . I don 't want to die either . What about one and three ? I 'm sure they 'll be fine . I don 't think any of us are gonna be fine . Even if we get through this . Look , about what happened on the space station ... I 'm sorry you had to see that . I didn 't mean to kill those men . It was just- - Instinct ? I was going to say reflex . I wasn 't ready , i wasn 't in control . Next time it 'll be different . You really think there 's gonna be a next time ? Maybe not for me . I thought i could make things different , you know ? Take a different path . Now it looks like i might not get the chance . Do me a favor , don 't give up on the others . [ one ] hold on , i think i got something here . [ zombie wheezes ] [ three ] you sure ? You see another way down ? No . [ one ] ugh . Slight problem . [ three ] what ? [ zombies wheezing ] Oh boy . How many ? Seven or eight , they don 't look like they 're doing too good . The lack of air must be affecting them more than us . Well that 's good . Easier for me to pick off . No ! No more bullets . Let 's remember what happened last time . So what 's your great idea ? I say we just go down there and walk right past them . For real ? Yeah . If one of them gives you any trouble , Just give ' em a swift kick . Look , they 're dying even faster than we are . Let 's take advantage of that while we still can . God , you better be right , this better work . Alright . Shut 'er down . [ three sighs ] Marauder , this is the raza . I did it . I managed to tap into the freigs emergency life support . Restoring o2 levels now . Thank god . [ zombies breathing heavily ] What 's that noise ? Fresh air . Get back up here , now ! Too late . [ rapid shots firing ] bang , bang , bang You can come down now . [ guns reload ] So much for no bullets . It was only a few . You 're welcome . Let 's get going . [ six ] this is the marauder . I 've got ' em . We 're heading bac . [ android ] he 's clean as well . No sign of the virus . [ three ] told ' ya . I didn 't even get a scratch . Now let 's go finish this job ? Hold on . How much time ? I should start showing symptoms any minute now . I 'm sorry . If there was anything i could 've done ... I know . But while you 're still you , thes one more thing we need to discu . What ? This is a big mistake . Do it . You didn 't really think we were gonna let that thing Fly itself back to civilization , did you ? Well , i guess there 's no way we 're getting paid now huh . Too bad . I 'm just surprised because I thought that we had an arrangement . You have something you 'd like to say ? I think i 'll save it for later . [ one ] how long has it been ? Over five hours . Shouldn 't she have started to show symptoms by now ? Normally , yes . I say we scan her again . We already did that . Look at her . Nothing 's happening . She 's not changing . What do we have to lose ? It 's gone . That can 't be . [ two ] i knew it . I knew i wasn 't changing . Let me out of here . I 'm done . [ one ] she 's right . Let her out . [ four ] are you sure that 's wise ? You saw the results . No virus detected . [ six ] how is that possible ? [ android ] according to the far horizon 's medical logs , No one has ever had a successful immune response To the virus before . [ four ] exactly . But that doesn 't change the fact That the virus is no longer present . There is no threat . [ one ] look , guys , i can 't explat any better than you can . But what are we going do ? Keep her in there forever ? I don 't suppose there 's any chance we can just Pretend like this never happene ? Didn 't think so . [ beeping ] Yup . [ beeping ] Hey . Hey . I hope i 'm not disturbing you . No , it 's fine , what 's up ? Look , i wanted to say i 'm sorry about losing the freighter . But one was right , it was just too dangerous . That 's fine . It just would have been nice to get a little cash In our pockets for once . Maybe get up to something fun . You know ... There are other ways to have fun That don 't cost anything . I am uh , i 'm a little , tired . You know it 's been a crazy day . Right . Next time .

Okay . don 't ever do this again ! Satoru . Don 't mind it . Everyone does trust the police . It 's nothing you should apologize for . You just called me Airi ! Katagiri ... . Why can you put your faith in me that much ? It isn 't thank I can . perhaps ? When I was still a kid ... My dad and I went grocery shopping . In a small shop in the city . When we finished shopping ... The man from the shop held my dad 's hand . There was a chocolate bar in his pocket . that would settle the issue . But my father insisted that he didn 't do it . In the end the final solution was to call the police . My father quit from his job . ... got divorced and left the city . After all these years .. ... my mother said .. At that time ... why couldn 't I believe in him ? These small hands of mine ... weren 't able to do anything for him . I want to believe you for my own sake . I want to believe that I can do something with this small hand . I see . Sorry . huh ? I 'm going back home and bring some stuffs for you . just stay right here .

I and your mother were once working together in the past . Don 't worry . The police won 't come here . I also didn 't murder your mother . You don 't suspect me ? She didn 't raise the kind of son who would kill her . Have a seat . I received a call from her . The case from 18 years ago ... as my son said ... .. the true suspect might be someone else . I probably know who that person is . I should have listened more . I 've always trusted the words of Shiratori and continue to search for the real perpetrator . Not only Shiratori but a lot of others were suspected too . Have some . The real culprit is very intelligent . To be able to make frame others as suspects . Could it be that I also ... Right . He buys time by framing someone else and change the circumstances in the scene . clues had been found . right ? To make Katagiri Airi shut her mouth off . Fujinuma Satoru ... he won 't be able to get to her now . This is the phone that I loaned from Katagiri Airi . Why would the culprit send a message from me and target her too ? The reasons that she got targeted is because the culprit may have noticed her . she was at the store with me . Why involve her too ? Could it be she might have met with him in another place too . she might have seen the true perpetrator in another place . That 's why ... She 's after her life to shut her up . Airi ... . It 's dangerous for you ! I 'll go instead . Hello ? Satoru ... . Can we meet now ? Airi ... . Are you okay ? Maybe I might have met up with the culprit . Wait for me at that place . But ... ! It 's fine . I promise I will go alone . Satoru ... . I wanted to see you ! Yeah . I 've thought about it a lot of times but ... I suspect the man named Nishizono . Nishizono ? Seems like he often drops by the store . I met him yesterday too . It looked like he had good relationship with the manager that 's why he could see my shift schedule . So he would also know where we live . Nishizono ... . Sorry . Why are you apologizing ? I got you involved too . ... and hurt you . You know what ? I 'm not hurt at all . Airi ... . I wanted to see you too . What ? What ? Fujinuma ! Fujinuma Satoru . You 're under arrest for murder and attempted murder resulting from arson . You 're wrong ! Satoru isn 't the culprit ! Stop it ! You 're wrong ! He 's not the culprit ! Stop it ! I 'm so sorry ! It 's because I brought you here ... ! It 's my fault ! No ... For believing in me thank you . Let 's go ! Satoru .. I 'm sorry ... . ! Satoru ! I 'm so sorry ! Satoru ! Forgive me ! STAY AWAY ! Woah ! You look cool ! Let 's go . Satoru . I returned ! Tomorrow ... okay ? Okay . Don 't abandon her midway now . Yes .

Yes ! Yashiro-sensei already called the Child Consultation Center . I see . That 's good . Just that ... after that .. Hinazuki and her mother might probably be separated .

Ms. Hinazuki Akemi ! We are from the Ishikari Development Bureau 's Child Consultation Center . huh ? the bureau would still come over . What 's with all these fuss ? What are you-- - We would like to take your daughter into custody . You 're wrong ... That 's not needed ... right ? Kayo ? Kayo ... Right ? Will you come with us ? Yes . Thank you so much . Shall we get a move on ? Be well . Yup . Thank you . Hinazuki 's alright now . I 'll take you home . By the way ... where did you guys hide Hinazuki ? We hid Kayo in the Izumi Elementary 's hockey club bus . It was a bus that was hardly used anymore . I see . Kids really are genius to find good hide out places . sensei . The one who moved the adults was you . you managed to gather courage and your actions lead to a conclusion . right ? Right . Let 's go . Airi ! Why cannot I come back to my time ? Is my " Revival " not yet over ? Satoru . What 's wrong ? It 's nothing . The body of an elementary girl from Ishikari that went missing since yesterday has been found . The police are still investigating the cause of death as of this morning . 11 years old . During the police investigation ... 426.8 ) } NAKANISHI AYA ( 11 ) I remember . If I can 't stop the real perpetrator ... will I not be able to save mom ? I need to change the future in any way ! I 'm home . Welcome back . Sawada . It 's been a while ! I said nice to meet you . huh ? I heard from your mother . That you saved your classmate ? No ... I didn 't really ... Our class adviser had already contacted the children center since before . That 's strange . I heard that the bureau moved immediately when they received the call from Yashiro-sensei . Really ? they haven 't been making a move on it . That 's what I heard from them anyway . Hmmm . I see ... Mr. Sawada ... What cases are you working on presently ? Is it about the student from Izumi named Nakanishi Aya ? yeah . And ... there 's also another different case that I have my eyes on . What would that case be ? just last month on the neighboring city ... A girl the same age as Nakanishi Aya ... Did she get killed ? Satoru ! How was she killed ? Looks like a black bag was found near the scene of the crime . Although her father was identified as the suspect but I 'm not satisfied by the results . There was a bag here . There were items such as boots and ropes ... Satoru . the true culprit lives in this city . And he is close to us . Kids really are genius to find good hide out places . Let 's save Hinazuki 's future ! Misato . Seems like you love books . but today is the last game of ice hockey . I 'd want you to occasionally cheer them on . He has a specific criteria ... . ... for the type of girls that he targets . The type of girls who don 't have many friends and are often alone . That 's why they 're easy to approach . Okay ? Promise me ? Later then . Advance ! Okay ! That 's it ! Hamada ! Shoot it directly ! Hamada ! Aim for a straight shot ! Misato ... do you also like ice hockey ? guys ! Jun ? Why ? Satoru ? What 's wrong ? Are you really sure that Misato rode on that vehicle ? There 's a small chance . I just wanted to check on it . What do you mean ? In this city there is a serial killer . The culprit is really calculating to be able to make others become suspects . He 's constantly escaping . Hinazuki almost became his prey . But he could no longer lay his hands on her so he changed his targets . I 'm sure that the case of the girl named Nakanishi Aya was still under the same culprit . right ? Tell me I 'm wrong ! The fact that you called the children bureau before hand for Hinazuki 's sake ... right ? right ? Even the homicides that happened in the next city of that young girl who was murdered ... right ? ... right ? ! You 're amazing . You knew that much . you know ? That an elementary child like you could anticipate my next moves and to corner me this much . I can 't allow you any further to interfere in my calculated plans . So I made Misato a bait . A bait ? Don 't worry . The only one who 's on that vehicle is Shiratori Jun 's father . you see ? Perhaps Misato might already be home by now ? You did all these to provoke me ? I didn 't really think you 'd fall for it . I was surprised . It was as if you could foresee far into the future . I 'm waving a thumbs up for you . Because you had me cornered this far . That 's a lie ! This is game over for me and for you . No way ! I 'm going to get out of this town ! this city will be peaceful ! Sensei ... sensei ! I ... ! He opened his eyes . it 's almost as if you 're not scathed . They said you can get out now if you have no complaints . Are you okay ? What year is it right now ? Are you alright ? I mean ... Your mother went back to your apartment . Kazuya and the others were worried . Hinazuki ... ? I see that you 've become an adult . Are you stupid ? My stomach is already this big . huh ? Are you happy ? You can say that again . Welcome home ! where 's your chopsticks ? You 're hopeless . We 're going to buy a lot of stuffs tomorrow . Mom ... Thank you . What a strange child you are . Did the future change immensely ? I want to believe that I can do something with this small hand . I am an ally of justice ! huh ? Raining now is really inconvenient for me . A camera ? Just bought it recently . So your dream was to become a photographer ? I also make pictures for my work . Work ? I 'm working as a manga illustrator . So you 're a mangaka ? That 's amazing ! Not really . There 's actually a manga that I love . Whenever I lose courage reading it would give me enough courage . Courage ? Yes . Looking for a job has been difficult lately . I 'm sure it 'll go well . The moment you speak out the words ... you 'll feel that they will really come true . That 's what I think so too . Really ? There was someone in the past who said the same things to me . Is she your girlfriend ? No . But she was someone important to me . Really ? I wanted to see you . When I and that person met here in the past I wanted to tell her that . Your manga is going along well . Take a seat . Well then ... what did you come for today ? I want to know where and what Yashiro-sensei is doing right now . What the heck happened to you suddenly ? Kenya . Got it . And let me also have a look at the murder cases that happened to where Yashiro-sensei was living .. ... from 18 years ago . Only from the elementary student victims . Satoru ? I ask you . Did you know why I became a lawyer ? Isn 't it because your father was a lawyer too ? There 's that factor too . But ... I already decided with you at that time . I also want to be an ally of justice ! Seriously ! Didn 't know one event could make anyone change this drastically ! Nishizono-sensei . Don 't mention it . Manager . I 'm off . - Thanks . - Thanks for your hardwork . - You did well today . - Thank you so much . You got married and you are now a member of Chiba city 's counsel . His wife 's father was also a member from Chiba 's city counsel . That 's why he changed his name from Yashiro to Nishizono . Nishizono ? And also ... These are all the murder cases from 18 years ago . These are all of the elementary students that got murdered . There is no significant change . The method of killing may all be different but he still eyes on targets that are more often alone . Elementary students ... Satoru ? That b * stards killing pattern hasn 't changed a bit . too ? Want to see a lot of kittens ? There 's really a lot of cute cats ! Let 's go . okay ? I was right . huh ? Managing to gather courage and your actions will lead to a conclusion . right ? Yashiro-sensei ... Do you ever think that history will continue to repeat itself ? Willing to change the future with the will of one 's heart ... you aren 't able to change anything . Is that true ? With human 's selfish desire and pride the string of hope will be cut off anytime . I ... ! ... want to believe that I have hope for the future . Satoru . You don 't know what real " solitude " is . Those kids-- - all of them are pure and unscathed . Then why do you do it ? ! There was a need to save them before they got tainted . Save " ? but I want to save them . I want to free them from the shackles of loneliness and injustice . All those pitiful and poor children ... I will receive a reply deserving of my efforts . I will grip it in this hand of mine ... An opportunity just for me . Stop messing around ! Free them from loneliness and injustice ? Deserving of your efforts ? Stop screwing with me ! You don 't have the right to take away the future of those children ! Not even an ounce of it ! sensei ... ! ... let 's put an end to this ! And this is now finally game over . Satoru . Stop it ... STOP IT ! Satoru ... ! With this hand save her future . right ? The one who gave me courage was ... sensei ! you had to do something unjustifiable ! Satoru ... ! hey ... ! CALL AN AMBULANCE ! HURRY ! Hey ... Satoru ... Satoru ... ! Get a grip ! I 'm alright ... An ally of justice won 't die . Isn 't it hard to fight on your own ? It 's because I have all of you who believes in me ... that I can do my best . Just joking . That 's a lie . Fighting is painfully frightening . Pretending not to see something that 's happening ... Just waiting for someone to do the deed is much more reassuring . But ... why do you fight ? it will keep on repeating over and over . I won 't be able to move forward . That 's why I fight . To move forward . In order to live . The real me is actually a coward . That 's why I put on a mask . Until one day ... The lie becomes a reality . And I can get real courage . Thank you so much for gathering here this year again . It 's not a bother . Right ? no problem at all . Go ahead . Thank you for taking me out of that place . The things I want to protect ... That would be you . It 's all of you . Even if I 'm the only one who 's missing in town ... I want you to smile . Even if you 're sad and depressed ... I 'm sure ... I will always be beside you ... 52.4 ) } Subtitles by FURRITSUBS

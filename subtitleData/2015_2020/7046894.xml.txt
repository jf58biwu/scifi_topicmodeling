 Understanding the human genome and the environmental impact on genes is the holy grail of life extension . While I still can 't tell you the exact number of genetic identicals we 're monitoring , I can introduce you to our most curated subject . Ladies and gentlemen , meet Rachel Duncan . When I was six years old , I became the only LEDA aware of the other clones . Dr Leekie shows me their files , so I can understand how experiences determine traits . Do you see your own file too ? Do you know your ID tag number ? Rachel . 779H41 . The encrypted ID tags are synthetic DNA sequences composed of four nucleotides , which patent the clones . That 's how you can tell that I 'm Rachel Duncan and not Lisa Glynn , 415K98 , or Cosima Niehaus , 324B21 . [ chuckles ] [ Westmorland on video call ] Mitochondrial DNA is fundamental to the healing process , but it 's only passed down by the mother . Our research into my anomalous longevity has only taken us so far . But now , thanks in large part to Rachel Duncan , we have found our Eve . Rachel , I 'll let you take it from here . [ screen beeps ] You 've all benefited from your seats at this table . We owe a great debt to Mr Westmorland . I don 't carry debts , Ms Duncan . [ Rachel ] Mr Al-Khatib , we freed your daughter from a genetic heart defect . What is that worth to you ? My mistake . I misspoke . Then , as you know , Dr Virginia Coady has taken over as head scientist from my late mother . Our next phase with a LIN28A subject is biopsies of her liver , lungs , and stomach . [ footsteps approaching ] You heard P.T. mention our modern-day Eve . Here she is . [ theme music playing ] Why do I have to stay here another night ? To monitor your sleep . [ sighs ] The needles hurt too much to sleep . We 're nearly done with that . [ Kira ] And then I can go home ? Yes , of course , you can . [ door beeps ] Come along . Um , I have a present for you . It 's a friendship bracelet . That 's very sweet . I made one of these when I was your age for a friend at summer camp . Are you guys still friends ? No . My mum moved me around too much to keep friends , too . Can I call my mum to say good night ? It 's bedtime . You can talk to her tomorrow . Okay . The Coast Guard found Cosima 's boat drifting offshore . Well ... Till you find them , don 't assume they 've drowned . Cosima 's taken a large portion of her cure . Your transport is ready to take you to the island . Keep me updated on Kira . Fuild has begun to collect around her eggs . [ Simon ] Her mother keeps calling to talk to her . Tell Sarah tomorrow as well . Tomorrow ? They took her away at bloody gunpoint . What are they doing to her ? [ Mrs S ] It 's my fault . I should 've stopped them . - We 're getting her back . - S , we 're not storming the gates . We need another way ... Hey ! Look , you were the one who taught me not to lose my head when things get tough . We can do this . We just need to think . Just so you know , I 'm really not in the mood for any surprise late-night DD . Dude , it 's DD in real life . - Hi . - Oh , my God . Cosima . When did you ... [ Cosima ] Yeah . I 'm so glad you 're okay . We escaped in a boat with only a map and compass . She was an amazing navigator . And then they put the boat in gear , sent it off unmanned . - Total Jason Bourne . - Yeah . I 'm West Coast . - Cosima , you 're home . - Yeah . So is our cure . - [ inhales ] - [ phone beeping ] That 's Sarah . I ... I have brutal news . They 're taking Kira 's eggs ? That 's what they 're doing ? - [ Cosima on video call ] I 'm so sorry . - When ? How long do we have ? Well , you said that they took her last night ? They 'll need to give her hormone injections before they can harvest . - I ... It 'll be at least another day . - [ Mrs S ] Jesus . She hasn 't even had her period yet . Yeah , well , we 're born with all the eggs we 'll ever have . And technically , they could extract them from infants . They 're doing it again to another generation of women . No , no , they 're not . This is our window . Okay ? Cosima , we need leverage to get Kira back . Yeah , um , okay . How about ... Westmorland is a total fraud . I saw a picture of him and Susan Duncan in 1967 . He 's just assumed this identity to sell his story . [ Mrs S ] I bloody knew it . Okay , well , Felix and Adele sent us all this information on the Neo money trail . We 'll keep on that if you just go over everything that I collected with the boys there . Yes , good , done . We 'll find out who this bastard really is . [ Alison ] Oh , goodness . Cosima , I just got your message . I 'm so happy you 're back . Hey , Alison . Where are you ? [ Alison ] California . I 'm back tomorrow . But this is not about me . What is going on with Kira ? I 'll fill you in , love , but leave the children with your mum . Uh , one more thing . Virginia Coady is on the island . And I 've got a feeling that didn 't end well for Susan . Where is she ? Beyond the arbour . [ helicopter flying overhead ] [ Westmorland ] Susan has shown me she doesn 't have the backbone , but you ... You have proven yourself . Will you join me at my side to lead Neolution forward ? Yes . Yes . I consider you my daughter . Hello , Rachel . How are you holding up ? She never believed in me . I know . I 'm so sorry . Well ... Virginia has been waiting to meet you . I offered her Susan 's old lab , but she 's nostalgic . Virginia Coady , meet Rachel Duncan . It 's an honour . The sentiment is mutual . I 've reviewed your work as a geneticist . It 's impressive . Glad to be back from the abyss . I 'm looking forward to working with you and Kira . Helena too , soon . So , should we get to it then ? Yes . Rachel , meet me in my office after your examination . My examination ? An endometrial biopsy to test the efficacy of the inoculation . We 'll have the results tomorrow . Virginia wants to cure the remaining LEDAs as much as you do . I 'll give you a moment to change . [ Westmorland ] You are no longer 779H41 or Neolution property . This document legally emancipates you . No more monitors . You 're free . Go home . [ sighs ] Any cramps since your inoculation ? [ Rachel ] No . A hopeful sign that it worked . Stabilise the LEDA subjects , so we can finally use them as a baseline . Your priorities are refreshing after Susan 's . Oh , she was always preaching . You can thank me for putting an end to that . Scooch forward . You can expect a few uncomfortable pinches . Just lay back . [ Dr Aldous ] Hmm . No obvious irregularities . - Should I still biopsy ? - Yes . Is that necessary ? Does this have something to do with 528M32 's latest results ? I 'm closely monitoring her disease . You never called it that before . Has another clone developed her same uterine growths ? Symptoms appeared in two other LEDAs . This will pinch . [ groans ] Your treatments on her have been useless . She coughed up blood . There 's no manual for treating disease in synthetic DNA . We 'll know more when we have further data . Meaning when another falls ill ? When will we have my results ? I 'm not permitted to share them . Don 't patronise me . I have a right to know . [ scoffs ] You 're not exempt from the experiment , Rachel . All done . And I didn 't see any irregularities . So that 's good . May I have some privacy , please ? Of course . Hey , do you remember this guy ? Ian Van Lier ? Yeah , at Brightborn . He 's the one who sent Delphine to the island after she was shot . Remember he talked about a board , a kind of corporate cabal , - who meet to push the Neo agenda . - Yeah . Well , if everyone on the island were into P.T. ' s myth , do you think the Neolution board did too ? Okay , so whoever he was had to disappear for him to become P.T. Yeah , he and Susan recruited Coady at Cambridge in the ' 70s . Student registration from Susan 's time , there 's a mountain . Susan and P.T. started resurrecting Neolution before 1967 . So , start looking for history majors and then science and philosophy . That 's how he spun his persona . All right . White Cambridge nerds who died in the 1960s , present yourselves . Van Lier is director at Dyad , Blue Zone Cosmetics , and 11 biotech companies . According to Adele , they 're all funnelling funds into a Dyad shell , which has made payments of hundreds of millions of dollars to a Kuwaiti consulting firm . " Consulting . " What are they using that for , bribes ? Well , I don 't know , but if it 's a slush fund , according to Adele , it 's controlled by this man here . Hashem Al-Khatib . Mmm-hmm . Follow him . [ exhales ] [ sighs ] Kira will find a way to call , love . We still have time . [ keyboard clacking ] [ computer beeps ] [ door opens ] Welcome home ... Oh , wow , Alison . Oh , God , Kira . I can 't imagine what Sarah 's going through . Yeah , well , we 'll support them in every way we can . Yes , oh , yes . God , I feel so guilty . Our kids are so safe and Sarah is always at risk because of this fluke of nature . Yeah , I ... Ali ... What ? I 'm sorry , your hair . Do you like it ? It 's artsy . Yes . - And purple . - Yes . I wanted something creative and free , you know . I ... I met this Jungian who just ... - Lives in that place . - A who ? A Jungian . " A Jungian " ? A practiser of Carl Jung . - Yeah , yeah . - Hmm . And I just am so much better at being present now . [ stuttering ] Honey ! I missed you so much , Alison . [ chuckles ] - And I missed this . - [ chuckles ] Oh , ouch ! What did I do ? Nothing . I just , um ... I did a little something to commemorate the transformation . Whoa ! " Liver deep . " - " Live deep . " - Live ... Live deep . - Yeah , there it is . - Yeah . - It 's a Thoreau quote . - Uh-huh . It means live deep and suck the marrow out of life . [ Alison chuckles and squeals ] [ man on phone ] We 'll make preparations . Kira 's hormone stimulation is on track and we will be ready tomorrow . [ Westmorland ] It 's not going to be an issue , is it ? The way they 've bonded . There is an attachment , to be sure . But I don 't foresee it clouding her judgement . Yes , well , keep me updated . [ phone beeps ] Was that Simon ? I have many people who report to me . Please sit . How was your examination ? In the future , I prefer to choose my own physician . And I expect advance notice . As you wish . Could you give me an update on Kira ? I estimate that we can harvest her eggs within 24 hours . And after she has recovered , we can begin studying her healing at deeper tissues . You 've grown quite fond of Kira , haven 't you ? She 's a special child , but I assure you I am unwavering . Good . After the surgery , I want you to bring her to the island . But we have the resources at Dyad to move on to the next steps . I 'd prefer to have her here . It is our change of tactic with Sarah which has brought her in . On whose behalf are you arguing now ? Your transport has been arranged . You know best . Who is that ? Virginia 's guest . Unlock his cuffs and leave us . Is all this really necessary ? I thought we had an agreement . You 're a traitor , Mark . You 're lucky we need you . You said you 'd cure me , if I helped you . Love makes you want to live , doesn 't it ? Gracie can 't look at me without searching for symptoms . I can 't imagine her all alone . Well , I 'm sorry she 's not here to help . But I need you to give me an ejaculate sample . That wasn 't part of our deal . You 've got plenty to spare . Now , you said you had information . I think I can help you find Helena . What are you doing here ? [ breathing heavily ] [ door opens ] [ gasping ] I was looking for you to say goodbye . Goodbye . [ mobile ringing ] Rachel , you 're still here . I thought you might like to read this . An autopsy report . [ chuckles ] I took initiative . The microscopic examination revealed the growths have spread to her thoracic cavity , even her kidneys . [ Rachel ] 528M32 . [ Dr Aldous ] Oh , my God , Rachel . - You killed her . - [ clicks tongue ] While you were sitting on your hands waiting for her to die naturally , when we need a cure . I won 't be shut out of my medical file . It 's my body . [ Dr Aldous ] Her name is Miriam Johnson . She was creative , a musician . [ Rachel ] She was homeless . And the mother you put her with was a drunk ! You raised me to be objective . Neolution raised you . Here ... In a corporation . What are you ? [ elevator bell dings ] Rachel , how was your trip ? Take her to her room . I have work to do . You said I could call my mom . Her follicles have swollen . [ Simon ] Right on target . Yes , good . Let her talk to her mother . Set up a video call . Keep a close eye on them . [ Mark ] Ira must 've been raised much differently than the rest of us . How did you choose which one of us would go ? The truth ? I drew straws . Am I the only one left ? Your brothers , they ... They all ... [ sighs ] [ sniffles and sighs ] [ sniffling ] Thank you for trusting me . You 're doing the right thing , Mark . Honey , are you sure you don 't want to just store your craft supplies , instead of donating them ? No , I 'm done with crafts . - Really ? - Yes . - All of your scissors ? - Mmm-hmm . The point of art is to lose control , Donnie . To reveal your inner chaos . I 'm uncovering my shadow self . And is that your inner artist or something ? Could be an artist , could just be the dark parts of yourself . The things ... Subconscious desires that aren 't necessarily good . Well , if they 're bad , don 't we want to keep them in the dark ? No , because then they manifest in behaviour . In my drinking , in my need to control everything . So , this is about your drinking ? Drinking is the effect of the unexplored shadow self . And that 's a Korg . Yes . So , wait , the craft room is becoming the music room ? That sounds pretty cool . I could get down with that . - We could lay down some tasty tracks . - Mmm-hmm . Should I get a bass ? I don 't know . Do you want a bass ? Okay , no bass . Drums ? Donnie , this is exactly what I 'm talking about . Bass , drums , I 'm not going to tell you what to do any more . I don 't need to . Really ? [ tune playing on keyboard ] They gave me lots of time to write my story . [ Sarah on video call ] Good , good . The last page I saw , mouse ... [ clicks tongue ] No , elephant went smoosh - and mouse went whoosh . Is that right ? - Mmm-hmm . Then , mouse got lost , the sun went away . And elephant was the only one left to play . And this is the last page . Mouse cried and asked to return to the sand . But elephant said she belonged in Wonderland . Is that the end ? I don 't know . I don 't think that 's the end . I think when you get here we 'll ... We 'll write the end of that , yeah ? We 'll work on it together . Okay . Say goodbye now , Kira . I miss you so much . I love you , more than anything . I 've never been so proud of you . [ sobbing ] [ sighs ] Rachel 's the elephant , and Wonderland is the island . They 're taking Kira to the island ? Coady 's there . [ glass clinking ] [ beeps ] [ remote beeps ] [ remote beeps ] [ remote beeps ] [ mobile ringing ] Mr Westmorland . How can I help you ? Rachel , I 'm just checking in to make sure that you 're all right . Why wouldn 't I be ? Well , I have asked you to do something that you don 't want to do . I would do anything for you . When I was a child at Dyad , I was so naive , I asked Leekie if I could call him " Dad " . Isn 't that funny ? [ Westmorland ] Well , you 've transcended that too , daughter . Which is why I 've shared all my secrets with you . Thank you for calling . You don 't have to worry . We 're about to proceed . [ door beeps ] Are you okay ? [ Rachel sniffles ] Who hurt you ? All of them . [ Simon ] The doctors are ready . It 's what P.T. wants . I will give her the sedative . I was the one who brought Kira to Dyad . I will be the last face she sees here . [ Westmorland ] Hello , Kira . I 'm Mr Westmorland . Do you have any idea how important you are ? I just want to go home to my mum . And I 'm counting down the minutes , until we meet in person . All right , we 've got nine obituaries for male students who died during Susan 's time there . These are the faces we have so far . Timothy Midwell , died 1969 . Alcohol poisoning . No . Henry Gonard , died ' 68 . He fell from a punt and drowned . Probably also alcohol poisoning . No . Winston Tralley , died ' 65 , rugby accident . No ! [ computer beeps ] Holy shit . [ mobile beeping ] Cosima , please tell me you have something . We got him , Sarah . [ mobile ringing ] John Patrick Mathieson . He 's not 170 . He was born in Texas in 1939 to an oil tycoon . Silver spoon so far up his arse , he could afford the ego it took to do this shit . I never knew his real name . But you knew he was a fraud . Fraud ? We 're all frauds . Get on to the board . Rachel , you knew his secret . What about your board ? How are they going to react to this ? Do you think they would listen to you , a nuisance clone ? Rachel , I know what you 're planning to do to Kira . What you 're planning to do with her eggs and taking her away . She needs her family . You needed ... You needed your family . And he took them away from you as an experiment . Don 't let that happen to Kira . Let her come home . It 's out of my hands , Sarah . - Please , no , Rachel ! - [ line disconnects ] [ door beeps ] Drink . Did you hate being studied when you were my age ? I don 't remember . Did you get used to it ? Yes . Why don 't you run ? Where would I go ? My mum used to do that . - Drink . - [ Kira whines ] Kira , be a good girl . Drink . Sarah is attempting to blackmail us , with fraudulent information to invalidate Mr Westmorland 's age . They faked this . She knows we 're not returning Kira . I 'll take care of them . Don 't hesitate , Simon . - [ knocks at door ] - It 's Art . Don 't worry , I 'm alone . What the hell are you doing here ? You won 't believe it . [ elevator bell dings ] [ beeps ] [ mobile ringing ] [ Simon ] They 're not here . [ Westmorland ] You need to return at once . [ rapid beeping ] [ Mrs S ] Kira ! What did you do to her ? She 's sedated . She 's fine . Let 's go , Siobhan . Thank you . [ mobile ringing ] [ breathing heavily ] [ computer chimes ] [ mobile ringing ] [ groans ] [ mobile continues ringing ] [ ringing stops ] [ glass shattering ] [ Rachel groans ] [ groaning ] [ groaning in pain ] [ groaning continues ] [ glass clinks ] [ groaning ] [ groaning continues ]

 In the not too distant future I hope that works . Come on . Holy shit . Oh man , that will be damn tight . We were almost too late . Where do you want to go ? So crap . Come on ! I have it . Hey ! Get out ! We have to get out of here . 6 days before Farewell , world Oh God ... Oh man , but they are well stocked . Damn it . Bingo . So what . Oh shit , damn it . Who 's there ? Elias ? What 's the matter , Roy ? What do these guys want in here ? The transport will be right here . What about your hut ? Is wobbly , but still stands . Do not worry , folks ! You will not miss anything here . This shack is a wreck . The owner is annoying and there is no tenant protection . This is for Carl . Connect his knee with it . - Yeah , all right . Where are you ? Elias ? ! Where are you ? I 'm so sorry . And what ? That I leave you alone all the time . It can not be otherwise , with what I do . I knew what I was going to do . I 'm worried . Something else could happen to you . I 'll be fine . OK ? Do not spend the whole day worrying about me . Better take care of you . - I 'll be back , Bess . I know you will . Elias , are you out there ? Elias , are you there ? Over . Yes I 'm listening . How did it go ? Most of the list I have found . You can tell Doc , I 'll take it over to him as fast as I can . Roger that . Goose trouble ? Only the usual . I managed to blind a drone with a grenade , But not really to damage . - I expect the full report later . end . - Yes , sir , you get . Well then ... If you 're a bomb , I 'll get rid of all the worries . So what is that ? And again , create the Hornets . Come on ! Who screamed ? ! Hey ! Who cries ? - What do you want ? Open up ! Who the hell are you ? - A friend of Frank , Who protects the house here . - Is gone . Has been crushed . Where did he go ? - Am I his mother ? Has vacated his place . I am now the new one . Look at the dump , if you do not believe me ? Who cried ? Probably the lady on the 3rd floor . Her husband was killed last week . Was probably too much for her . I 'm Mike . Elias . So you are the famous Elias . Already heard from you . - So ? And what ? That you are something like Mother Theresa always helps everyone . Oh , do you say that ? Hey man . Do not get me wrong , I find the admirable . Something other than this eternal " one-eats-the-other " . Do you think there are extraterrestrials ? All this here . Invasion of extraterrestrials . It looks like it all . I just wish the little green males came to the fore . Then it would finally be right what to fight , Instead of the shitty attacks by the damn drones . In truth , they are yellow when you ask me . I check up what 's going on . Take it down . - Okay . Holy ... As you see , one-eats-the-other is literally meant . Human meat tastes better . Yes ! No movement ! Do not worry . I am not a savage . Am quite peaceful . What 's going on here ? - There is trouble on the street . The supply truck . - Yes , there is always trouble on the street . Where do you live ? - In a shelter in Koreatown . Better go back , it 's too dangerous . I can see that I 'm bringing you something to eat . Come on ! - Thank you . - All right . Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! Come on , you bitch . How 's it going on the south side ? - Hey , Elias . Road with nail chains . The front ones are in the bucket . - Real shit . May I help you ? - Thank you , we come clear . Crap ! Come on , there 's the sow ! Out of the way , bum . Hey. hey ! Looks like you 're all alone . Come on , Rhys . Just this one time , agreed ? There are people who really need the food . - I really need it . We live in difficult times . You see , Elias . I say it quite simply : When I 'm hungry , then I eat . Maybe I 'll eat you as a neighbor . - You can try this , But I already taste a bit gammy . Drones ! Path ! Go away ! Come on ! Hurry ! Nice toys . I 'm on it . Attention ! The entire crew to the Baker loader lamp . The supply has arrived . The supply has arrived . Start for immediate unloading and distribution . Attention ! The entire crew to the Baker loader lamp . The supply has arrived . I saw no truck on your list for this week ? Rhys and his horde did the South Central Transport team . No survivor . - I 'm talking to her commander . The second loss this week . These hurenses are becoming more and more dreary . No losses . If you do not count the truck . We 'll get them another time . The markets south of the city ... - They are empty swept . - Do you think I do not know ? We still look up again . Clear . Wait a moment , Zane . There 's something else . You 're the only one I can trust . Do not worry , Rhys . They are all loyal . Up to a certain point . Until they think themselves cleverer than their leader . They are already doing this . - It can not be , That they are content with a full stomach . In times like these , it is enough to survive . - Yes , most . But since when do we think like that ? Only survive is for squirrels . When I was in the army , I respected only the officers , Who risked everything to win . Taking chances is the only true path to success . The Colonel in his ivory tower ... He should not be the one to lead the defense . You should do it , Rhys . No . The system does as if it were looking for innovators and their own minds , But they did not want me in their army . That is why I have set up my own . - And ? What you up to ? What am I doing ? ! The Hornets gave Elias a special weapon in their crudely unaware . You saw what she can do . - I 've never seen a drone run off . I agree . This weapon becomes our new trump card . Hey , Doc ! - Say you 've found everything . Hopefully everything in it . - Thank you , Elias . Food and medicine are the most important . We can only fight the enemy if we remain strong . I have something in my backpack , which could significantly improve our chances . They do not believe what they gave me . I came home , and this was waiting for me . Does it matter ? - It has more power than anything from us . It does not destroy them , but it hides them . Gives us a bit of time . It fires a kind of densified laser . A gift from the Hornets ? - Of those or the Santa Claus . I hope we get more weapons . According to the latest report an invasion group approaches the east coast . We need all the firepower we can get . Getty ! Take a look at what Elias brought with us . In two hours I will know all about it . - If you bring fleas back , I can not help you . - Not at all , scratch it . The thing does not come from China . Let 's check it out . This was already fired . - How do you know this ? Has a counter . Let 's see . This little shit uses a highly developed target detection technology . And also high-energy lithium-air batteries . Missile capability . A charger was not there , right ? Why you ? No idea . - I think it does not suit you either . You 're right . Let 's see what the thing can do . Genius , these insects . Whoever they are . I only wish they came out of the cover . - The Colonel says they have a plan . He can not say which one . But they have one . We just do not overlook the big picture . An indication would already suffice . - For this I would like a manual . And a bloody steak with a good cabernet . Tell me about the big picture . Yes , man , really bad . And they say we are still lucky . The East Coast has got it full . Such luck , too . Come on ! What 's happening . Sir ? Three groups a two . Eagle lineup . Ah , they brought their brethren with them . Come the hundredth . - Very fast . Typical . Only a world sunset clears the freeway . - Wait ! They are slower . Are near Koreatown . What are you looking for ? People . They 're looking for people , sir . Elias , wait ! Let 's get out of here ! Hurry , come on . Are everyone there ? Come on ! Take it easy , you disappear ! Make sure you get away ! Disappear at last . Come on ! Into the house around the corner . Pure there . Take care , pure there . Hurry . Sit down , Garth . Yes , that 's good . Wall times , let 's see . We can not stay here . Let us go . - Do not scream like that , The people are already scared enough . He needs a printing bandage . I 've got something . Are you a doctor ? - Thank you . Paramedic . An idea how things are going now ? Yes , not far from here is a deployment center . With food and medicine . - Heaven on earth . - That 's the way it is , As long as it is still there . What 's your name ? - Kate . I am Elias . We need to get away ! - Okay . Get up ! - Get up , move . Back out , hurry . Come on ! - Come on , folks ! How far is it ? - We 're almost there . What did you lose up there ? So you can kill yourself . We are from San Diego . The city is a single cemetery . Yeah . - No food no water . A convoy has brought us here . Just before the city we were attacked . How many were you ? - 75 . Only we are left . - I 'm really sorry . I did not meet anyone who could get rid of the things . Some things get better . Hey , Getty ! Getty ? If you can hear me , tell Doc , I 'll bring some wounded . Wait a minute . The crap is just on the steam . Big Apple ! Come , Big Apple . Here is Angel One . We will respond to your emergency call . Come , Big Apple . You do not answer , sir . - Try it . Big Apple ! Come , Big Apple . Here is Angel One . Can you hear me ? Over . Angel One . Here 's Big Apple . We have strong electrical disturbances . Possibly an attack with electromagnetic waves . We are sewing a large flying object . Probably a drones battle ship . Larger than anything so far . One moment please . The ground of the flying object begins to glow . Massive ... Here through . - Quiet , very quiet . - Put him on the bed . - Calm . Doc , we need you here , fast . - One moment please ! And here . Caution , Caution ! My friend has 3rd degree bleeding . He needs fresh blood urgently . I am a paramedic . - Can you feel a fracture ? - Clear . Let 's go . - Elias ! Now listen . Yes , sir ? - New York was completely eradicated . The Hornets tried to help , but ... The same kind of drones as in New York are now also in Chicago . First , the big cities are devastated . That is , we are the next . What do we do with the people here ? They can neither go nor run . Before that , we can not run away . We have to fight . What about the Hornets ? Are they planning an offensive ? Not since the destruction of New York . Hold an earthquake ! Colonel , we need you up here , right away . Roger that . I 'm on my way . Let us prepare ourselves for the worst . If the Hornets , We need you . That is an order . - Of course , sir . What else ? Hey . - Hey . - Everything OK ? Yes of course . Thank you . Do you need something else ? - No , I have everything . I 'm leaving now . See you . - Is good . Hey , Getty , here is Elias . I now go over to my booth in the 6th vector . How is it outside ? Patrol drones , as usual , Boss . No swarms . Take care of yourself . When was the last time you slept ? - No idea . Lie down on my couch . At the moment I do not need them often . I 'm good . - Please , if you overturn , do not help me . That will not happen . - Yes , it will ! Excuse me , I 'm a little grumpy about everything here . I 'm glad you 're here ... - Kate . I 'm Erwin . But nobody calls me like that . Even my mother called me Doc . - All right , Doc . Nice if I can help . You are wounded ! - Nothing else . That 's OK . Stop hitting the hard . - All right . Amazing what you put on your feet . In the flood of wounded . - In the beginning I got a lot of help . I had my brother . He came back in search of supplies . - I 'm sorry . Elias appeared at the time . One of our patrols found him half-dead outside the stadium . They brought him here and I mended him . Since then he has been collecting the coals for us from the fire . - He 's full . Saved our asses . Is apparently his hobby , but do not ask why . Everyone needs something that keeps him alive . The first is to take care of themselves . The other ... ? Try to save the world ? Maybe a bit late for that . - I do not understand . Perhaps we would have a chance with more people like Elias . Maybe you 're right , I do not know . The Colonel , in any case , relied on him . A Colonel has a say here ? - Yes , he is the officer with the highest rank . In this sector . Is a good man , dedicated , but soldier , that is realist . I have to leave the order , in case of an evacuation , all the bedridden . Victims are brought to ensure the survival of others , he says . I 'm not entirely of his opinion . Attention ! All scouts gather at Dock 3 for the night patrol . All scouts to the loading dock 3 . What is this at all ? Is somehow semi-shelter and semi-deployment center . That 's quite well . Four emergency bases were built after the first attacks . In any case , there is something like order here . There was no such thing in San Diego . No law . No hiding places . When there was no more food , we went back to the Stone Age . On the streets the naked madness . Yes . - The people began to ... I 've heard . Did not , frankly , surprise me . Order and security are just an illusion . They are something that we are talking about , so that we feel better . Do you understand ? Like this mighty building . It 's really powerful . It will protect us . But I tell you Kate ... It is always harder for me to keep my head from this slaughter . Hold on , Doc . They make this great . Thank you . And now you 're resting , yeah ? - Yes . I 'll wake you up in a couple of hours , then help Linda . Do not panic , it 's just me . What the hell have happened to you , Bro ? The blanket fell on my head . Do not tell shit . Does not look good . Does not feel good either . We go back to the base and you come with us . No is not accepted . - All right . Damn it . Oh , wow . What does the thing do with human flesh ? It just melt , presumably . Like your face was dipped in lava . I 'm not your enemy , Rhys . - Sure , we 're good friends . Do not let us exaggerate . - Why not ? You have a nice place here . Oh how sweet . Looked more tidy than your lady was still here . Do not touch it , put it away . - He 's so sensitive . Really impractical in these times , right ? Focus on the real enemy and stop fucking us all ! Who is the real enemy ? Who controls these machines ? We do not know that . Nobody knows that . Then the machines act independently ? These so-called Hornets seem damned much to know . And if they know so much , then they are probably behind it . That 's crazy . You 're sick , Rhys . I want a meeting with your friends . I have a few questions to them . This is not the case . It would also be in your interest to get it . If you want to keep your pretty face . Watch out ! Roy ! Roy ! Elias . Elias , where are you ? Help me ! Help me ! Excuse the theater , Sergeant . People should not know when we come and go . All right . You belong to the Hornets ? Highest rank . Science or military ? - Can I be both ? - Clear . I thought most of you are scientists . Many of them are . We come from both areas , Public and private . - Yeah . How do you like the new weapon ? - Oh , it 's fantastic . I wish we had a million of it . - We are working on it . We took a few changes while you slept . To the test phase also belongs to the sergeant . I should like to inform you : They have passed with flying colors . Does not feel so . How are the others ? - Vesna is dead . The rest is pissed and half-blind . Just like me . These Hornets . - What ? These were the Hornets . The used a high-tech Blend grenade . Your eyes are clear . The Hornets use light bombs instead of killing . - Because they do not want us . But him . We are only inconsiderable harassment for those , small fish . - But I 'm offended . - You should , too . Why are the Hornets so shittily greedy for this guy ? What makes this guy so special ? - He 's clean . Like the Colonel . It fulfills the requirements . Image is not a war . They totally surpass Elias' importance and we underestimate you . But I change that . - And how ? We have achieved quite a bit with a fairly small bunch of people . Now imagine , we would be much bigger , proportionate . How do you do that with Castings ? - No . And when you do it , the yield was lean . Vesna was our last good weapon . The enemy of my enemy is my friend . You can not be serious ? Bone ? ! He has the manpower . - Yes , and he has four notches on his rifle butts , For our people he has done . - We have drawn together ! You take that too personally , Zane . I ... Where chips are planted , chips fall . A few losses belong to our business . - Say this time Butchy , Mac , Sheila and Alex . Yes / Yes ... Alex , was that his name ? Your . - Your . If so , anyway . An alliance would make us really strong . A force powerful enough to really change this city . From a city that constantly recedes , into one that attacks . Call him . - I can not do better . Take care ! Oh , and Zane ... Please , be nice . Are you going ! Guard Officer , the staff management awaits your report . They are pretty well posed here . How many people do you have ? Not enough . We have lost many good people in New York . But we 're building new teams . All over . Yes ? For what ? Well , let 's just say , for the days of waiting . The days of hope just disappear . To be honest , they are already over . Hallelujah ... Cool cut ! - What ? Oh nothing ! - I thought so . Okay , there 's a lot of bad blood here in the room . But we can not undo things . I 'll tell you something now . Bone . Times of despair call for extraordinary measures , right ? Who is desperate ? - Did not you tell everyone he was not a liar ? Why should I listen to you at all ? Because I 'm telling the truth . And because this truth will move mountains ! When we bundle our forces . No , it 's okay . The Hornets have given the keys to the kingdom the gentle . This is a mistake . No , this prophecy proved to be a lie ! They are not supposed to take over the earth ! We will subdue their fortress and take control . There 's everything . Information , weapons , the foundations of our new beginning . Bone , if we alliance , the power of the Hornets will belong to us . What do I get from that ? We make half-a-half , half for each . If you want less , I 'm not sad either . My brother . We just caught a radio call . From Vegas comes a delivery of fresh food and medicine . Come across the bridge on 6th Street in four hours . - Class ! Class ! This is our ticket , so go ! Let 's go . Success or failure mainly depend on the timing , Sergeant . They are here , for phase 4 . What is Phase 4 ? Not that I know what are the phases 1 , 2 and 3 . 10 more clicks to the finish , Ma 'am . They swallowed the bait . - What kind of bait ? Three weeks ago , our specialists deciphered access to the machines . Can you see it . The scrambles communicate in a very complex , electrical language . Like insect patter . When we had decrypted it , We realized we can send them messages . They think they 're helping a downed comrade , But instead she expects a nasty surprise . Let me guess the thing is booming ? And that mighty , powerful mighty . Charge them . And go out with her right away . Give me camera 9 . - Yes , Ma 'am . I never saw a drone on the ground . How did you get it ? We 've done it with an improved version of the weapon that you have . Knowledge makes us strong . This and time are the most valuable . 5 clicks , comes closer . Why does a drone come to save another , If they are only robots . Why do they care ? But that is ... Like soldiers . They follow instructions . Not much different from you and me . Are on a rescue mission . Still 2 clicks , Ma 'am . Hey , wait . The ... This is not a scapegoat . Believing in the impossible made you the one who is you . Do not give it up . - Yes , but these mother ships can To destroy a whole city . What are they doing here ? Target within sight . How is the status ? - The unit is in position . Activate . Yes , Ma 'am . Activated . Armored How do you know if this works ? We do not know . It worked fine . Twelve lapsed at once . It works like a swelling amplifier Of ever-repeated explosions . One triggers the next . It spreads in the ship like a computer virus , Until the beast is dead . - But you 're not sure . That is why we call this a test . Come with me . We have used teams in some large cities that work with similar devices . The signal lancers have great attractiveness , So there are no drones on the ground to complete your mission . That we have just one here is a happy coincidence . - Are you waiting . My mission ? - Los Angeles is one of your main attractions . You will receive a code to activate your device . Kill the beasts . Where is Davis and Martin ? Just go back , Ma 'am . Take it all , Elias . Whatever happens , That 's the only way to get ahead . The only way to defeat them . What 's wrong with the things , who 's behind it ? No idea . We could not prove biological life . As far as we know , everything is mechanical . Powerful drilling machines that extract liquid metal from the earth 's core . The goal has stopped , Ma 'am . Prepare to fire ! Ready ! Put on glasses . I hope that works . Davis and Martin are done . - bastards . Fackle them off ! I fire . What is the status of the target ? - Hard to say to , Ma 'am . We have strong electrical disturbances . Looks like it 's going to disappear and got a big deal . But is not done yet . Not yet . We need to change the virus . When is the van coming ? - Within the next hour . We also increased the activity of Rhys and his people in the sector ? reported . Just three times as many people , we need this delivery . - Sir ! What belongs to Elijah ? - No , sir . Our last contact is over 8 hours ago . Since then he had not heard from him . Not his kind . Doc , here is a woman with terrible pain . Can I give her morphia ? It 's empty . - I need antibiotics , she is badly wounded . Is everything gone . You can ... At the office is a bottle of brandy , take the . Is good . - What belongs to Elias ? There is a rumor of a delivery which is about to arrive . Maybe he 's drifting around there . - I hope he does . Hold tight ! One thing is certain : we are on the right track . Let 's go back . Attention , attack ! - They send attack drones . We have to leave here . Immediately . Makes the helicopter start . I stop them . Come on , hurry . Make sure you get behind the shelter ! Come on ! Running ! Hurry , do it , run ! We need to get away from here . - Hurry up . Make sure you get away ! And the rest of your team ? - Do their job . This is ours . Still has its spine , the mother ship . Its a lot to do . We have no time . - A lot less than you think . Sucking the further so fast , This planet can soon no longer sustain human life . And how much time is left ? - A few weeks , with some luck . We also found something under the earth . Is perhaps nothing , but we consider it a new form of drone . Where we are at drones . Why do not they follow the helicopter ? We are disguised . Until they decipher it . Just like your vehicle . What vehicle ? You will see . Do not forget : Your job is to save L.A. , which it also costs . Your activation code for the device in L.A. Where is the bomb ? - It is only urgently necessary to modify them . We 'll let you know when it 's finished . - Okay . Colonel Jayden also receives the bomb coordinates . If something happens to you , he brings the operation to an end . We will take you to the edge of the city . At an old military radio station from the Second World War . There is an armed transport . You can not locate the drones . - I understand . There 's something else , Elias . Be careful ! Au Back ! Hopefully I can drive the thing . Attention ! The entire crew to the Baker loader lamp . The truck has arrived . To unload and distribute . Where were you ? We were waiting for you ! Come on , boys , let 's go ! Let 's go to work ! There were shots . Some guys pushed in at the bottom . - Built barricades ! Alpha and delta . Come on . Go Go ! I am not a soldier . - From now on . Attention ! It is shot . It is shot . What 's happening ? - The shoot . - Who then ? Do not go . We have to take care of the people . Doc ! What about weapons ? Are there any ? ! I hate sick people . Stop ! - What do you want ? - Stop ! We have only just begun . Find out how we get up ! Slick , put these assholes away . I do not want to catch anything . Slick ! - Hello my beautiful . Zane , I need the direct wire to the Colonel . I want to play mild big . Come on ! You damn pig ! Take care ! No no no no no . We can not kill anyone who is ready to fight . I would never fight for you , you scum . Hey , not at all . You do not know what you 're missing . Keep your eyes open . - Yes , sir . Something heard from below ? - No , nothing , sir . Try to reach Sergeant Bennet in South Side . - I tried . They do not answer . - Sir ! You have contacted us . Who ? - The Hornets . Very official . They give instructions . It has begun . - What ? Revenge ! How is it ? - Nothing . Until now . Spend quietly further precious time with Blondie . Jealous ? - I hate such women . The little mischief ! You can sniff my rifle at once . Come down . You 'll get them in time . Let us look at the reward . We must go to the command center . I do not want our guys rumstreunern like young puppies . - So what ! Done ! The main deployment center is probably in one of the rooms In the upper floor . Directly under the roof . The accesses are obviously defended with machine guns . If we attack them frontally , we are crushed . But we have Bones men . Let them be the cannon fodder . Which way is the most direct ? It is difficult to read from this . There are elevator batteries and stairs . But can also be explosions or lead to emptiness . Then we reduce the options . Here we go . You have beautiful hair . Hey , Doc . What is the shortest way to the command center ? No idea . I 'm just a doctor . Will you tell me you 've never been up there ? - Yes . Not even to measure the colonel fever ? - I agree . Man , that 's interesting . You stupid asshole ! No no . Only someone with great determination . How do I get to the command center ? - Do not tell him . No ! No no ! I 'll show you . - Come on , then . The good doctor will show us the way . Radio the others . You can not wage war if you constantly hold your eggs with one hand . The Colonel is not a leader , he is not even a good soldier . That 's why it 's better if I take the reins . Here is your wire to the commander . Is a bit bloody . Is yes disgusting ... What ? - They do not know exactly what is going on . Here is what moves . - Loader Delta . Keep them as long as you can . Sir , have lost contact with Bergman and Green ! And there are at least 12 intruders . - The coordinates are not allowed ! Safe the laptop . If necessary , we evacuate . Yes , sir . Identify yourself ! Identify yourself ! Doc , are you ? It is a trap ! Come on , fire ! There are too many ! Help us . We are overrun ! There are new instructions , sir . The homers change the location of the bomb . The coordinates are still open . - Dranbleiben , Team Bravo . Sir , this is Bennett with medicine and food . - Make him loud . Sgt. Bennett , return to the base immediately . We are under attack . I repeat : We are attacked . Juchu , Colonel ! Rhys . - They are encircled . I have the food , the weapons , all the supplies . I also have hostages that all hang on their lives . But they will not be long if you do not give me all the data And hand out devices that you have received from the Homer . What equipment ? - Do not do this , okay ? Do not insult my intelligence . They will give me everything . Just ask how many bodies are being piled up . We must now play for time . Getty , pack the laptop . Tell them we are cooperating . Come on , come to the Alamo . Just courage , boy . Have not I expressed myself clearly enough ? They have 15 minutes to get down and deliver the stuff . Do not do that ... I will begin to kill the wounded . For each 5 minutes you are going to be a . We can not stop them ! Pull back to the roof . Right now . Mark , here is Elias . I 'll come in now . Elias , stay where you are . Do not get ringed . Repeat : Not allowed . We are just being rolled over ! What does that mean ? Where is the Colonel ? He retreated to the hiding-place delta . The Alamo ? - Positive ! This is the collection point . Go to him , Elias . We are lost . Mark , do you understand me ? Dock 2 . Everything replenished and ready . Go to hiding . I 'll give you cover . No ! How about it , buddy ? Prepares much less pain . You are through . - Yes ! Bone , what 's up ? We 're inside , Rhys . Outstanding . Find the Colonel and take him to me . What are you doing , you worm ? Where are you going ? Where are the Hornet data ? And where is the Colonel ? - I do not know that . In the hiding place in Little Tokyo . Get a city map . The little worm will show us exactly where . Am on the way to Alamo . Instructions follow when I am there . Here is Baker , 4-51 , on a safe channel . I am waiting for the transmission of the final coordinates . Over . You stay here on the radio , okay ? Slick is a couple of psychos . We meet at the truck . - What happened ? - The Colonel , we must look for him . You come with . - No . Leave me ! Here we go ! Well , let 's go . Come on , get up ! Come on , high ! You want to live ! Come on , hurry ! Fast ! Do it already . All is well . The drones can not see the truck . You are safe . Saint . There is a doctor where we go . He cares for you , promised . - Thank you . - Everything will be fine . Transmission of the bomb coordinates begins . Over . Have understood . They arrive . They arrive . Go to hell ! Colonel ! Stay with me , sir . - My cards are not good . What the hell was that ? You tell me . They are getting better by the minute . What was going on at the base ? Rhys , he attacked the building . He took all of them as hostages . - Damn , damn it ! Do not worry . - No ! - I 'll take you to the transport . Listen to me . I have the new coordinates . Everything you need for the bomb . Still 2 hours of detonation . I know what I have to do . Yes , you always did . But please do not forget the people . Save as many as you can . Get them off this Rhys . This scum . Otherwise , they will not survive . Save her , boy . Otherwise everything was in vain . I will , sir . I promise . Just ... Colonel ? Colonel ! Where is it , Elias ? The whole planet burns , if you do not know . - Yes , I know . And what do you and the Colonel do ? Wait until we 're all torched ? Your wish came true . The Colonel is dead . I 'm sorry . Fearful , probably . Or in the fight against drones . Honorable . Not like you savages . Honor ... - Yes , honor . Honor . Let 's test it . Slick ! Hey ! Always with Tranquillity . " Always with Tranquillity " . Why do you say that ? You and the Colonel are like one egg to another . Behave like idiots ! That 's just what mix you and me . Let them run . It 's clear . I let them run . You pull out the Hornet 's stuff , and you 'll get it . If you do not , I feed her to the wolves . You can believe me , there is not much left . Kate ! Elias ! Come ! They are one to me . This way . Come on , you bitch ! Sign up , Rhys . Can you hear me ? Rhys , where are you ? Damn it . And how is it ? - Unchanged . The last message was that they were entering the hiding-place to intercept the Colonel . Minutes later , there was a big shooting , Roar and then it was quiet . - When was it ? - 15 minutes ago . Sounds bad . Maybe what is with her radio ? - But maybe they 're all torched . We should look for them . - No . Bone says we should wait here . So we wait . - You follow Bone 's instructions ? I do not follow any instructions from anyone . I 'm smart enough to know where the wind is blowing from . And at the moment he is blowing in the direction of Bone . So this means you 'll blow Bone one ? No . This is your specialty . Fog a bit of your judgment ... - Maybe I 'll stuff you in here . Negligible tossicher deins . Perverse . Maybe later . Look When Rhys is out of the running , the command falls to Bone . If I were you , I would times the data pre-button , Which they got from the command center to find out , What the Hornets plan . - What do you think I 'm doing , Judas ? I think Bone knows you are loyal to Rhys . In your place , I would soon begin to make a good impression . For otherwise you may end up like these poor pigs . Or worse . The Colonel probably took valuable information . No ... He certainly wanted to distract us from the really important things . I do not believe that . The cries were different from the usual fear-drones screaming . They sounded panicky . They have met something completely new . Whatever it is , it could be more valuable than anything that is at our disposal . You 're too secret , Zane . I tell Bone you 're on board . With him we will bring it far . You 'll see . He even takes care of our conversation Such a Roman Colloseum 's shit For the common people . Do you understand ? This is how people are led . Do you know what , T.J. ? I 'm still trying to reach Rhys . And if he is not dead , How fast you pee to his leg . Do not you think so ? Anyway . I 'm ready . Rhys , sign up . Do you hear me ? Rhys , please report ! Great cart . I have a patient for you . Look for her . Low pulse . She needs blood . What 's this ? - These are the coordinates . We have two hours left . The Hornets have built the bomb , To put the mother ships out of action . When one of those appears , It will be a huge surprise . Provided it works . Sounds like we do not have much time . - Right , we did not . Then let 's go . Keep going . - Okay . All who are ailing , to the wall . Come on ! Food only for soldiers . You want to eat ? Then fight against each other . Until death . Whoever wins , survives . The other ... Ã ¢ â , ¬ Â ¬ reduced like dogs ! Have tried to reach Rhys . War but also none . Over . It 's an emergency ? Do you understand me ? Over . Kate is talking about the medical department . Does anyone hear me ? Here is Bone . Where is Rhys ? Rhys and Slick were severely wounded in a drones attack . Your vehicle is completely destroyed . All the others are dead . The drones hang on our ass , And we race like the devil . Go , open the gate ! Come on , move ! Get the food out there and then get out of here . - All out here . Come on . Hey ! Kate ! Away from here ! Come on , get out of here . Runt , Runt . Hurry , do it . Hurry , make it already ! I did not like the quarters anyway . To be missed . You prefer your apartment ... Oh , keep it . This is an even bigger dump . That was not always so . You mean you had someone ? - Yes , I had someone . She was one of them . I tell you . Through it , the apartment was wonderful . She made a real home from it . If it had gone along , it would have looked like a student 's house . I lost them on the first attack in the stadium . It was completely destroyed , full of smoke , and I could not find it anywhere . I could hear them . Listen , how she called for me and ... Then this part of the stadium is completely collapsed . Never seen her again . I 'm sorry . I know how it is to lose someone . Yes , but if we lose this fight , we lose everything . We do not lose . We are there ! Get out ! - Come on . - Go into the house . Go to the house ! Hurry up ! Look ! I was not so close to a mother ship . And you ? Yes , closer than I liked . Find a room where we can accommodate the wounded . And a room for the food . I want to see how much we have . - Looks like someone else Everything prepared for us . Why do not they do the same ? Why the whole drill ? - Very easily : We are not the only ones fighting in this war . If we fall out , someone will continue where we stopped . Until there is no more . Is this a drone-tracking system ? Looks like that . Considerably better than anything I 've ever seen . There it is . Exactly there . I want you to take me there . To this exact place . And you do what ? - What is there ? This is the Sprengladung . And what happens now ? First , I take the computer to me . And then I disappear . - You 're going back to town ? ! That 's crazy ! - Someone has to stop them . Otherwise we will lose the whole city and all the people in it . With all the technology here , we can not ignite them ? - Obviously not . Getty , you have to take me there now . I count on you . Just no pressure . Good work , Kate . - Let me at least come along . No , not at all . I am a paramedic . So someone need you there . - Does not matter at all . No . I 'm tired of losing people who mean something to me . I do not want to lose you . I 'll do it alone and that 's it . Bring it to an end . I will . Thank you . I 'll be right back . That 's crazy . Here is Elias . Do you hear me ? Are you with me ? You hear K-RON , the Apocalypse radio with yours Monday afternoon drama report . Watch the sky , friends , and take an umbrella with you . Very funny , Getty . This is not good . Not good at all . Crap . We have a lot of electrical noise here . You are our IT-Fritze . Clear them . For sure ! I 'm looking at the end-of-the-world manual . Do you see me on your screen ? - Have you . All right . Drive to tithing . This is exceptionally times free . And you 're in town , on the Temple to the Hill . But be careful . Everywhere in the city are drones . Roger that . Where do the flashes come from ? This does not make any sense . Getty , here is Elias . Do you hear me ? Getty ! Report you ! - Elias , can you repeat it ? Out here ... Strong disturbances . I can not understand you . ... in trouble ... Elias , you have to go away . Get off the road ! Getty ? Stupid shit . Such a crap . A few of them do not see me . No no no no . The sendemast is in the bucket ! Fault in the stealth function . Fault in the stealth function . Oh , no , no . Not now , please . Come on ... Just do not pay attention to me . What the hell are you doing ? They 'll kill you . And you too . Watch out ! Calling back . Hold it until I get the truck . Come on baby . Go on , go on . He does not want to go . Forget it . We have to get out of here . Hurry ! Come on . The radio was still there . - Do you also find the way ? For sure . But what ? Come over ! Holy shit . Look at this . This is damn tight . Come on . Where do you want to go ? All right , I got it . Who are they ? - Finished ! Is sharp . She was the chief of the Hornets . We can do nothing more for them . Let 's get out of here . - Elias ! The insects have made us a great toy , right ? What , you 're still alive ? Come on . The game is over . Let 's get out of here . We drown anyway . Look , age ... Maybe the time is right . Perhaps now is the moment where we all go . This may be true for you , but we both disappear . No , you will not . Not today . Today we are all going to hell . Go on . - Okay . There , you see ? Done . You did it ! Oh my God ! It 's over . - No . That 's just the beginning .

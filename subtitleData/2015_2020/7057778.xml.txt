 [ engine rumbling ] [ beeping ] [ sighs ] [ screams ] Shiro ? [ Keith ] He 's gone . - There 's nothin ' out here , Coran . - I 'm sorry , Keith . [ Keith ] I 'm comin ' home . [ sniffing ] I 'm worried it smells a bit musty . It 's been a while since I 've had to look presentable . The Cubserions just declared independence after a thousand years of oppression , so they probably won 't notice . Then why am I getting all puffed up like a Trufalian meringue ? This is going to be a serious diplomatic meeting . Remember , Princess , 70 percent of diplomacy is appearance . Then 29 percent is manners , decorum , formalities and chit-chat . It 's really only one percent ... Serious business about fighting for the freedom of the universe ? Yes . That . Oh , and I forgot hors d 'oeuvres . Oh , that 's at least two percent . So I 'll have to recalculate my ... We just freed these planets . Do you really think they 're ready to come together to fight the Galra ? I don 't think it 's a question of wanting to fight back , but of believing that it 's possible . It 's up to you to give them that faith . It should be Voltron . We can 't always put the fate of the universe in the hands of a giant weapon . At least , that 's what your father believed . About 30 ticks to the drop zone . You ready , Kolivan ? Affirmative . [ laser blasts ] [ Lance ] Hold on , evasive action underway ! Lance , I think we just passed the drop zone . We 're under heavy fire . There 's no way we can stop here . - [ Lance ] Kolivan , any ideas ? - [ Kolivan ] Open the hatch . We 'll take it from here . Go ! Go ! Go ! [ whirring ] Think you 're pretty good , huh ? Can you handle this ? Didn 't think so . Huh ? Hunk , you got a fighter right on your six ! Yeah , and I 'm about to teach this sentry a lesson about tailgating . - [ Kolivan ] Paladins ! Can you hear me ? - We hear you , what 's up ? We 're pinned down by heavy artillery . We need air support . [ blasting ] [ Lance ] I see it . I 'll take it out . - [ whirs ] - [ Lance ] Uh-oh ! - I can 't get a safe angle of attack . - Maybe not from the front . [ crashing ] It appears the Galra forces are evacuating . [ Hunk ] Yeah , and stay out ! Let 's set ' em down over there and get ready for the parade . - [ clicking ] - [ girls cooing ] Now this is the kind of world-saving that a Paladin could get used to . Whoo ! You got that right . Oh , methinks I 'll try this one with all the legs . - [ growls ] - Nope . Still alive . [ clicking ] [ Lance chuckles ] Whoo ! Yeah . [ crowd ] Oh ! Ah ! [ all murmuring ] Hmm ... You know , based on our recent battles , it seems like the Galra Empire is kinda just falling apart . It 's more than that . Look . - Whoa ! - [ clicks ] [ Kolivan ] Word of Voltron 's triumph is spreading . Yeah , I guess the only problem is that we can 't form Voltron anymore . That cannot stand . The universe needs Voltron . [ man ] Lions of Voltron , the people of Puig thank you for delivering us from the evil hands of the Galra Empire . Don 't forget the Blade of Marmora . We couldn 't have done it without Kolivan and his team . It was our honor . Yes . I want to pledge to you that every able-bodied Puigian will join Voltron in the fight against the Galra . Speaking of Voltron , where is it ? [ crowd shouting ] Voltron ! Voltron ! Voltron ! Voltron ! [ chanting ] Voltron ! Voltron ! Voltron ! - I think this might be a problem . - [ crowd chanting ] Voltron ! Voltron ! [ faint whirring ] Oh , number five , you 're back ! How was your mission ? I talked to some members of the desert tribes on Planet Kythra who have these same large feathered ears . They 're not friendly to Zarkon , but they couldn 't help identify the person in the footage . So , that 's a dead-end . Now , these flappy , loosey , pant-thingies ... Are skort pantaloons . Very breathable . Right . They 're traditionally worn by the Tando people . Yes , in the Valurian quadrant . Right . That 's on the other side of the galaxy . And what 's this mask thing that they all have on their faces ? [ Coran ] Hmm . No idea . But it appears to be the perfect blend of fashion and function . Okay . So my brother was either taken by intergalactic fashion pirates , or ... maybe the outer reaches of these galaxies are occupied by freedom fighters that are starting to work together against the Galra Empire . You know , I don 't mind telling you this , but I was considered a bit of an intergalactic fashion pirate in my day . I used to have a bogwaggle-cape that I trained to sing my theme song whenever I entered a room . [ chuckles ] Maybe this will help . While I was gone I had the system analyze the sound of the explosion from the prison break . - [ whirs ] - [ explosion audio plays ] [ beeping ] [ Pidge ] Huh . Nanothermite titanium-boron . Hey , maybe we can track that . Good idea . While you do that , I 'm gonna check in with Lance and Hunk and see how things went on Planet Puig . [ beeps ] Don 't worry , Matt . I 'll find you . [ Hunk ] They haven 't figured out their flatbread situation , but what they do with those centipedes is just out of this world . And they 're totally ready to join the fight against the Galra . Nice ! We brought back a few of their leaders to join the coalition . That 's splendid . Excellent work ! You know , I gotta say , this is what it 's all about ... freeing ' the people , lovin ' the ladies , then bombing ' down the road again looking for adventure , Voltron-style . Which brings up a little issue . They all want to see Voltron , only we don 't really have Voltron anymore . We don 't have Shiro anymore , either . Everyone seems to have forgotten that . It may be difficult for us all to accept , but it is time to think about finding a new pilot for the Black Lion . No ! I 'm gonna find him . Shiro is the one person who never gave up on me . I won 't give up on him . [ rings ] [ snaps ] [ Haggar ] No one is to be allowed in Emperor Zarkon 's chamber . Vrepit sa . - Excuse me . - What is it , Commander Throk ? Would it be possible to speak to Zarkon today ? Another planet was lost to rebellion and I feel he must be informed . Zarkon is fully briefed on all imperial matters . - He certainly doesn 't need your input . - Of course . It is just that I fear if we do not take decisive action soon , the Empire will crumble completely . Rebel activity should be crushed with our full might before more planets are inspired to fight against us . Lotor has arrived at headquarters at Zarkon 's request to take command of the Empire . Under Zarkon 's guidance , of course . Lotor ? Why is he not at his father 's bedside ? Zarkon needs no one by his bedside . Least of all , you . Hmm . [ Allura ] It is our honor to have you all here together . I had the biggest bunker back on Puig , but it wasn 't nearly this nice . [ voice gurgles ] Well , I spent the last decade sleeping in a spiny thistle thicket . You look wonderful though , Princess . I 'm glad I put on my best tarp . Welcome , everyone . Welcome . I 've prepared a few Earth canap√©s for our distinguished guests to enjoy while we talk galactic diplomacy . The Blade of Marmora has gathered this intelligence . As you can see , the Galra Empire is still the most massive ruling force the universe has ever seen . The sheer size of it is almost incomprehensible . It seems like it could rule another 10,000 years . [ shudders ] Not the way I would have started this pep talk , but okay . However , we are beginning to see signs of increased rebel activity from within the Empire . [ all gasp ] We have a strategy to bring these forces together , free more planets , grow our numbers , and accumulate an army that can defeat the Galra in major battles . But without your help , it will be impossible . [ electronic voice ] The forces will all fight behind Voltron , right ? Yes , where is Voltron ? The people you see before you are the Paladins of Voltron . Together , they pilot the mighty lions that form the great warrior . Excellent ! Can they form Voltron now ? - Uh , well ... - We can 't form Voltron , okay ? We can fly the lions , but Voltron is not happening . [ all gasp ] What he means is that right now they can 't do it , but- - But nothing . Shiro is gone . He was the Black Lion . And until we find him , there is no Voltron . The lions are still a substantial fighting force and this Castle is also a considerable weapon . The Blade of Marmora can lead you . My people have been enslaved for centuries by soldiers who look exactly like you . Yes ! Our people have heard the legend of Voltron , how he defeated Zarkon . That is what gave them hope . What are we supposed to tell them now ? Tell them to stand up and fight for themselves ! Voltron is gone ! [ whirs ] [ weak chuckle ] Pizza roll ? Pig in a blanket ? I 'll have a pizza roll . [ crowd cheering ] [ roars ] [ blade rings ] I tried to speak with Lord Zarkon today , but the witch stopped me again . I fear the Emperor 's condition may be worse than she is telling us . I 'm not sure he will ever return to the throne . Agreed . And now Prince Lotor is taking over ? We 've fought by Zarkon 's side forever , and now we are passed over by this exiled brat . I 've heard rumors he fights alongside his enlisted men like a lowly private . Worse than that , his top generals aren 't even pure Galra . They are half-breeds at best . He has no honor . [ General ] Some say he allows the planets he conquers to continue to rule themselves . - Can you imagine ? - [ Throk ] Clearly he 's a dangerous lunatic . I 've already spoken with the other officers in my sector . They 've all agreed to back me if I fight for the throne . Normally , I would never think of such a thing , but ... What choice do we have ? Then you 'll support me ? Yes . [ blade clanging ] Who 's this little fellow ? I don 't know . I 've never seen him before . [ crowd cheering ] [ grunts , growls ] [ blade rings ] [ crowd cheers ] [ warrior groans ] [ cheering continues ] [ both ] Huh ... ? Lotor ! Throk . You wish to challenge me ? Then come down and claim your crown . [ crowd gasps ] True Galra do not take the throne by stirring up insurrection in darkened chambers . They rise through honorable rite of combat . Defeat me here and the throne is yours . [ cheering ] [ growls ] Humph . [ growls ] [ growls ] - I gladly accept your offer . - [ crowd cheering ] Now all will see who is the rightful leader . I have fought thousands of battles and left many enemies much more fearsome than you wasting on the battlefields . - [ blade whirs ] - [ yells ] You have flawless technique , that I 'll grant you . Still , you must realize at some point , that your repetitive attacks are getting you nowhere . [ yelling ] [ groans ] [ clangs ] [ grunts ] Your tactics are stale . And in the end , your own aggression is your undoing . [ crowd cheering ] [ chanting ] Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Huh ? My father built our Empire on the bones of his enemies . But the time has come to change the old ways , and inspire not fear from those we rule , but loyalty . We must not waste our energy fighting to keep our subjects down , but rather multiply it , by allowing those worthy to rise and join our ranks . [ faint gasp ] The Universe can no longer doubt our strength . Each ally gained only makes us stronger , while those who continue to stand against us ... will be crushed . Lotor , we pledge our loyalty to you . Vrepit sa . [ crowd chanting ] Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! Lotor ! [ purring ] [ footsteps approaching ] That went well . The masses are easily manipulated . Have Throk transferred out to the Ulippa System immediately . Let him rot with the ice worms . Hey , man . Listen ... we all miss Shiro . I remember what a thrill it was to meet him for the first time when the two of us carried him out of that garrison hospital . I grew up with my dad and Matt telling me stories about him . He was a legend at our house . [ Hunk ] The guy taught me everything I know about being a pilot . Which isn 't much , but that 's more on me . You 're not the only one hurting , man . We 're all right there with you . But you know that he would be the first one to tell us that we have to move on . [ Allura ] Keith , I know exactly how you feel . But our mission is bigger than any one individual . Even those who are completely irreplaceable . I know you 're right . It 's time to figure out how to reform Voltron .

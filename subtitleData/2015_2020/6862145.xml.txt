 [ Allura ] All right then , what 's the next one ? [ squeaking ] - Two words . - [ squeaking ] Second word . Waves ? So I 'm close . Ocean ? Splash ? Drink ? Water ? [ squeaking ] Water ! All right then . First word . [ growling ] [ Allura ] That 's a Bytor ! Bytor water ! - [ laughs ] Yes ! - [ joyful squeaking ] Hunk was right . These Earth road trip games do help pass the time . [ beeping ] How are you , Princess ? Are you almost at the Balmera ? I 'm scheduled to arrive in just a few doboshes . I hope I 'm able to find a crystal big enough for the teludav . Have you heard from the other Paladins ? I had contact with Lance , Shiro and Pidge a little bit ago . They 've located Slav . - What about Hunk and- - and Keith ? - No word from them yet . I have no doubt my scientifically accurate instructional video was of great help . I 'm sure it was . If they collect enough scaultrite for the lenses , will your teludav structure be complete ? It 's nearly done . The Olkari and I have been working on it day and night . It will be ready in time . [ sighs ] Oh , I hope so . [ Coran ] What 's going on , Princess ? You sound worried . I was thinking of my father . He gave his life to try to keep Voltron out of Zarkon 's hands and now we have a chance to defeat him . I ... I don 't want to fail . [ Coran ] You know ... Princess , your father would be proud of you . It wasn 't that long ago we found out Altea had been destroyed . - I 've never felt so alone . - Nor have I. And we could have easily given up . But we didn 't . You didn 't . And now look at us . We reformed Voltron . We freed the Olkari and the Balmerans , and now they 're working alongside us . You 're right , Coran . We have allies . And that 's what 's going to defeat Zarkon . Crack a squizzle on the Balmera , Princess . Thank you , Coran . - [ rumbling ] - [ gasps ] [ jets decelerating ] The Balmera welcomes your return , Princess Allura . Princess , did Hunk accompany you ? I 'm sorry , Shay , but I 've come alone . The others are on missions of their own , collecting important elements that we need to defeat Zarkon . Defeat Zarkon ? How can we help ? The Balmera and its people can never thank you enough for all that you 've done . If the Balmera will give it , I need a crystal . [ Shay ] Battleship class ? Bigger . - [ Druid ] Haggar . - What is it ? We found further evidence of the spy within our fleet . This encrypted chip was in the outbound quantum entanglement chain . Put the chip back , and wait to see who retrieves it . [ Allura ] Incredible . When the Galra were here , these caverns were closed off . As if the Balmera was protecting itself . Now that the Balmera is free and healed , the crystal caverns are opened once more . [ humming ] [ rumbling ] [ rumbling ] Of what was that rumble ? Perhaps because a crystal this big has never been asked for . No , this is something different . Shall we stop the ceremony ? [ grandmother ] Let her finish . Thank you . [ Shay ] The crystal has been loaded onto your castle , Princess . We wish you could stay longer . I made you stickercup stew for the sky road . Oh , thank you . I 'm sure I shall enjoy this immensely . To all you Balmerans , thank you once again . - [ rumbling ] - [ gasps and screams ] [ gasps ] What was that ? [ crackling ] Oh , no ! [ screaming and yelling ] - [ gasps ] - Take cover in the Balmera ! I 'll hold it off with the castle 's defenses . Hurry , hurry ! Particle barrier up ! [ lasers humming , firing ] Those crystals are acting as shields . [ grunts ] I need to lure it away from the Balmera ! [ jet engines revving ] [ jet engines revving ] - [ Hunk grunts ] - [ Keith ] I didn 't just turn Galra ! Are you trying to see if my skin is purple ? - No . - [ computer beeps ] [ Allura ] Hunk , Keith , are you there ? Can you hear me ? Hunk and Keith here . What 's going on , Princess ? You must return to the castle ! I need you ! We 're on our way . [ Lance ] All right , what are we doing now ? Let 's call Allura and let her know that we have Slav and we 're ready for her to use the teludav . You didn 't say we 'd be traveling by teludav . What 's the problem ? We 're traveling by teludav . So just count your hair follicles or fluff a pillow , or whatever you need to do to make sure we survive the wormhole trip in this reality ! I was just going to point out that the teludav is a very efficient form of travel . - [ Allura ] Paladins , are you there ? - [ Lance ] Princess , what 's happening ? That monster that attacked us on the Balmera before has returned ! - [ all ] What ? - [ squawks ] [ Allura ] I need you back here immediately . You got it , Princess . Sharpshooter is on the way . Sharpshooter ? It 's my new nickname that I gave myself . Just- - Just pass it on . [ Shiro ] Ready when you are , Allura . [ Lance ] Whoa ! How is that thing operational ? It doesn 't have a head ! [ Pidge ] I don 't know , but I 'm sure it has something to do with those crystals . [ Shiro ] We can 't worry about that now . We have to protect the castle . [ whimpering ] How did we beat it last time ? We formed Voltron , then I stuck in my Bayard and shot it with my blaster right in its arm lasers . But that didn 't stop it so then we had to punch it . - So we 're gonna need Voltron . - But we only have two lions . Well , maybe we can form the legs and kick it ? [ Lance ] Whoa ! That new laser is much more powerful . We 're definitely gonna need all the lions . Hunk , you distract it so we can fly into the castle . Once we get our lions out , we 'll cover you so you can fly Keith in for Red . [ Hunk ] Wait , wait , wait . I have to hold that thing off by myself ? [ Pidge ] You have Keith . Yeah , but he 's in here with me ! [ Shiro ] There 's no time to argue . We got to do this now . [ Hunk ] Oh , Quiznak . [ grunts , groans ] Commander Thace , did you find what you were looking for ? [ groaning ] Take him to Haggar 's lab . [ Hunk ] Those crystals are blocking all of our attacks ! Oh , no ! The castle is doomed unless we distract that beast . [ Keith ] Good , it 's chasing us . [ panting ] Ahh ... [ Allura ] The particle barrier is severely damaged . Lance , get back out to give Hunk cover . - Pidge and I are right behind you . - You got it , Shiro . Don 't worry about me . I 'll just hang out here . Can you help the Princess restore the particle barrier ? Yes . - Now ? - Oh , you mean in this reality . Got it . Oh ... [ whimpering ] [ Keith ] Bank left ! Barrel roll ! - Nose dive ! - Quit back lion driving ! - [ beeping ] - I 'll distract it ! Go get the Red Lion ! Oh ho ho , good timing , Lance ! [ blaster revving up ] [ Hunk and Keith ] Aaah ! Guys ! [ grunts ] [ Keith ] Hunk , do something . [ Hunk ] I can 't move ! I 'm hit . Nothing 's working ! Come on , boy . Come back to me . - [ Pidge ] We need to protect Hunk . - [ Shiro ] I 've got him ! I 'm getting real sick of that crystal . Let 's take it out . [ Pidge ] On it . [ screaming , groaning ] [ Pidge ] Shiro , it 's on its way to the castle ! - [ Shiro ] I got it ! - [ Hunk ] Well , who 's got me ? Where are you going ? I 'll jump out and jetpack over to the castle . [ laughs ] Good one . Wait , serious ? [ Shiro ] Form jaw blade ! Got to hurry ! [ Pidge ] We 'll keep the crystals busy . Shiro , you attack from the other side . [ Shiro ] On my way . [ grunting ] [ growls ] [ Hunk ] Hey , my lion 's working again ! I 'm back , baby ! Okay . Let 's go . Oh , whoa . Wait , what ? Oh , man ! Not again ! Oh , no , no , no ! Sorry I 'm late , guys . Okay , let 's form Voltron and take this thing down like we did last time . I don 't think the Robeast is gonna sit around and wait for us to transform . Keith 's right . We 'll need to think of something else . [ Hunk ] Hey , at least we outnumber those crystal shields . [ Lance ] Yeah , he can only block two of us . [ Pidge ] I think I 've got an idea . Guys , see if you can get me an open shot at its chest . [ Shiro ] Got it ! [ crackling ] [ Shiro ] Nice job , Pidge . - Now form Voltron ! - [ all ] Yeah ! [ all yelling ] [ electricity crackling ] [ Allura ] Great work , Paladins . Now return to the castle so we can get back to Olkarion . [ beeping ] Why is there a grand entrance on the 40th floor ? And what 's with all the ziplines ? You have hover technology . Well , you know what ? Ziplines were quite fashionable 10,000 years ago . - Allura , have you heard from Coran ? - Yes . So we ready to pop through the wormhole and get back to Olkarion ? Yes , I 've checked in with Coran and the teludav is nearly complete . Hunk , thank you for getting the scaultrite . No problem . You know , Keith was there too . [ Coran ] We 've made great progress while you were gone . And now that we have the scaultrite , we should be finished in less than a quintant . [ Lance ] Wow . That is one giant teludav . [ Keith ] Nice work , Coran . Good job , Coran . Fist bump . Now blow it up . Oh , don 't you dare ! It took forever to build this teludav . And let 's not forget it 's a pivotal piece that we need for our plan to defeat Zarkon . - [ beeping ] - Aaah ! I 've made some improvements to your design . This will increase our chances of survival in this reality 205 percent . - Is this guy a little- - ? - Yes . - No doubt . - Not a fan . [ Coran ] Stop hitting the teludav ! - [ explosion ] - [ Slav ] Ow . [ footsteps approaching ] [ Coran ] Princess , there 's something I 've been meaning to talk to you about . What is it , Coran ? This plan of ours , it 's ... Well , it 's dangerous , you know ? We 're taking certain risks . You are taking certain risks . This teludav , the amount of exertion it will take ... I ju- - You may not survive . Coran , I know the risks . Your father would be proud of the leader that you 've become . What 's everybody thinking about ? - Zarkon . - Calzones . I mean , uh , heck , yeah , I 'm thinking about calzones , okay ? I mean , does it always have to be about Zarkon ? He 's a bad guy . We 're trying to defeat him . I get it . - I 'm hungry . - [ stomach rumbles ] We 've come a long way . Yeah , remember when Hunk used to throw up from riding in the elevator ? [ groans ] You guys remember that Arusian , Klaizap ? I think his name was ? Cool name . [ chuckles ] Yeah , Keith tried to beat him up even though he 's the size of a peanut . He was their bravest warrior ! How about the time the food goo machines attacked us in the kitchen ? That was the scariest thing that 's happened to me the entire time I 've been here . - Oh , come on . - What ? It 's the truth ! [ Lance ] We faced sentries , a haunted castle , giant Robeasts , a mall security guard . - And don 't forget that cool cube thing . - Yeah , and that awful cube thing . You realize once we defeat Zarkon , the universe won 't need Voltron anymore . - We can return to Earth . - I can look for my family . I guess I could look for mine . This is it . As long as everything goes according to plan , we can 't fail . No more questions . I 'll get the truth out of you one way or another . - [ drills whirring ] - [ machines clicking ]

 [ narrator ] It is the year 4032 . Man 's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations known as Abbies , [ screeching ] That rule the Earth . [ screaming ] One man saw the catastrophe coming . He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2000 years and defy mankind 's extinction . Surrounded by mountains and protected by an electric fence , the last of humanity left alive on Earth , do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines . [ narrator ] Previously an Wayward Pines ... We 'll protect the harvesters . What about the Abbies ? We have never used fire on them before . Don 't know what they understand about it . Well , tonight they 'll learn . Use the flame throwers ! [ screaming ] Finally reached the city . [ Jason ] Pilcher sent a dozen nomads out beyond the fence and Adam 's the only one who 's ever returned . You knew all along . You were working with Pilcher . - I wanna call it off . - It 's done , Adam . My family is all gone because of you . Tell him . Xander and I are married . He 's my husband . I heard you caught one of those creatures in the middle of town . [ Kerry ] It 's the first female we 've ever seen . [ Megan ] As with any species , they 're different . They 're not just dumb animals . There 's a method to them , if you can survive long enough to learn it . [ birds chirping ] [ growling ] [ chomping ] [ chomping ] [ helicopter whirring ] [ growls ] [ growling ] [ gun firing ] [ gun firing ] [ growling ] [ gun firing ] [ man on radio ] We 've cleared the valley , sir . We are commencing the ground sweep to confirm our perimeter is secure . [ man ] Clear ! The area 's secure , sir . We can now begin construction on the fence . [ growling ] We should have a baby . You and I . Really ? You 're ready to do that with me ? Well , we 've encouraged the first generation to procreate enthusiastically . [ giggles ] I think we 're ready to set an example . A son to lead . Or a daughter . Ora son . One of both . Four of both . What 's wrong ? It 's nothing . Just a lot on my mind , same as you . It 's okay to have hope . - We 're doing well . - The town ? There 's still the problem with the rust and the water line and- - I 'm talking about us , Kerry . We make a great team . I knew you were the right choice . [ blues music playing ] So , what will it be ? Well ... I tried your beer which is revolting . The whole celery soda thing , I don 't know what that is , so ... Your choice . How about that ? Distilled from pure Kentucky water , really ? Where did you get this ? - Hassler drag it back in ? { bartender chuckles ] It is a very nice label . Unfortunately what 's inside of it , we brewed two weeks ago , in the woods . [ chuckles ] [ chuckles ] Sorry . - You know what this place needs ? - Hmm ? A town drunk . Job 's open . I did look for you , Theo . I did what I could to find you . I 'm here because I know you have questions . I 'm tired of secrets . Did you try to have a baby ? [ siren wailing ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ phone ringing ] [ growling ] [ growling ] Everybody up , we gotta go now ! Leave everything behind , there 's no time ! [ indistinct chatter ] [ whistling ] " Oh , my God ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Now ! Now ! [ woman ] Help us ! [ growling ] [ screaming ] [ screaming ] Theresa . [ woman over PA ] Attention , citizens of Wayward Pines , a " able-bodied men , please report to the fire station immediately . [ keyboard clacking ] [ beeping ] [ Abby screaming ] [ growling ] [ shrieking ] [ theme music playing ] Hey , what 's happening ? The crops , they 're on fire . - On fire , how ? - We don 't know what happened . - We 're going out there . - Who 's going out there ? Anyone who can . [ indistinct chatter ] [ siren wailing ] You should get to the hospital . I 'll meet you there and I 'll see what I can do here . You should go . [ Kerry ] Dr. Yedlin , we need your help , can you come with me now ? They 're back , aren 't they ? We 've seen some of them out there , yes . Why are you sending civilians ? Soldiers to fight the Abbies , civilians to fight the fires . - It 's not the same thing . - Well , they 'll die the same . Should we just let the crops burn ? If we lose the food , then we 're all dead . What about the explorers , CJ , the trucks ? We lost contact with them ten minutes ago . We need you at the hospital right now . [ woman over PA ] Attentian , citizens of Wayward Pines , a " able-bodied men , please report to the fire station immediately . We should think about ... - You 're going out there ? - We need guns . - To fight against them ? - No . To defend ourselves , against whatever 's out there . Can you get us in ? The mountain ? Xander . Look , I 'm not trying to drag you into something again . I 'm just trying to avoid a slaughter . I 've worked with Jason , and I don 't trust him . We lose those crops , we lose everything ! [ indistinct chatter ] All right , we gotta get this out ! Let 's get the hoses over here ! [ indistinct chatter ] [ Abbies growling ] [ shrieking ] [ gun firing ] We brought tape , all the gauze , saline , the sutures , the OR is ready . They told us to prepare 20 beds . Are we really expecting 20 patients all at once ? We 'll need more , discharge some more . - More than 20 ? - We don 't have any tags . What ? Triage tags . Get some markers , we 'll write on their forearms . Hey , everybody . Ev- - Stop , stop . Listen to me . I 'll triage as they arrive and I 'll assign them out . Letters for each color . G is green . Green is minor . Yellow can wait . Red is immediate . Black , deceased . Do not let them self-evaluate . Listen to what I say and be calm . Look , I want you to know where everything is , right now . Because I don 't want any supply runs when I 've got someone going asystole on my table . We 're gonna offer the best care to the most that we can . We can do this . Come here . Can I just say , sir , there 's no one I 'd rather be in a mass casualty- - - Shut up , Oscar . - Yes , sir . [ Abbies growling ] [ soldier screaming ] [ moaning in pain ] [ man screaming ] [ man screaming ] More suction . All right , he 's good , suture him up . Next ! [ indistinct chatter ] - He 's gone . - These are bite marks . [ man ] More coming ' in ! Move ! We need more stretchers out here ! I 'm okay . The Abbies got past us to the crops . Try and help her ! Yellow . Stop the bleeding in his shoulder . She 's hypotensive and tachycardia . Get her an IV bag . Ampicilin . Two grams . We just used the last bag . I looked . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Okay , breathe . Slowly , slowly . Her stats are dropping . [ rapid beeping ] Theresa , your name is Theresa , right ? Look at me , my name is Theo , I need you to look at me right now . You have a collapsed lung , that 's why you 're having trouble breathing . - Dr. Yedlin ! - I 'm gonna get you through this ! I 'm not gonna leave you , okay ? - Dr. Yedlin . - You got it . I need your help ! Slow , breathe in and out . In , out , good , I 'm not leaving you . There you go . I have to insert this in your chest , it 's gonna hurt , but it 's gonna let you breathe . Are you ready ? [ gasping ] [ gasping ] - Dr. Yedlin . - That 's better . Dr. Yedlin ! Why aren 't the first generation patients being prioritized ? They are if they are dying . [ man screaming ] The femoral artery , I can 't find it ! Clamp it on . I 'm trying , there 's too much blood . Dr. Yedlin , I need you to do this . I can 't , my hand is in a patient right now . You can do it . Put pressure on the thigh and have your fingers find the artery . Dig your fingers in there . [ screaming ] Yes , I think I found it . Bring the clamp in , don 't take your fingers off until it 's fully clamped . I got it . His heart rate is coming down . [ beeping ] [ man grunting ] [ Kerry ] No one could 've predicted what happened tonight . I should 've been able to predict it . That the fields would burn ? How could you know that ? It 's an impossible situation . If I can 't trust my own instincts , rely on what Pilcher taught me , what good am I ? I should have had us more prepared . You did prepare us , by planting them in the first place . 'Cause nothing would grow in Wayward Pines . Why is that , Kerry ? What 's wrong with the soil here ? Why didn 't Pilcher account for it ? What did we do to it ? And what does it tell us if we have to die to get the food we need to survive ? Who the hell are you ? Because I thought you were the man born to lead this town . Trained by Pilcher himself to usher mankind into the next generation ... Kerry . But that is not who I see in front of me right now . Because what I see ... is weakness . And fear . Are you the man born to lead ? Yes . Then act like it . And never let them see you doubting , Even if you do . Dr. Yedlin , hey . I was out there with the firefighters . One of them got a piece of me . How 's your jaw ? Well , it hurts to smile . Was that the point ? One of them . Hey , I left our wife in your office . She actually saved some lives too , tonight . But I 'll let her tell you all about it . Since everything 's out in the open now . Oh , and Doc , the first one 's free but the next one 's gonna cost you . You still have feelings for him ? Our marriage was like all the others in Wayward Pines at first . There were rules . There was surveillance . We were no more than cell-mates . I chose you before any of this happened . [ footsteps approaching ] Dr. Yedlin , we need you . [ Theo ] That 's not an answer . [ breathing heavily ] Okay , just ... try not to move too much . Are you a doctor here ? Chief Resident , yes . Dr. Yedlin called on me earlier tonight to perform a femoral artery clamp . - Theresa . - Who ? Theresa Burke . You should get some rest . Is she dead ? I can 't really discuss that . Is she ... Just tell me . I mean that ... You have to be family . [ CJ ] The Abbies were targeting any man with a hose . Their goal clearly was to stop us from saving the crops . You 're saying the Abbies knew what the men were doing and targeted them ? [ Megan ] I 'm sure it was very confusing out there , Mario . - In the dark , the heat of the battle- - - I know what I saw , ma 'am . As I watched my men die . How many troops do we have left ? We lost half of the men , sir . We have less than 20 soldiers left . Perhaps we should reconsider recruiting so heavily from the first generation . We 'll recruit more of them . It 's an honor to serve against a real enemy . Our real enemy already did what they came to do . Attack our food source . Sorry , you make it sound as if the Abbies had a plan . They set fires at the corners so that it would spread faster . The Abbies never used fire as a weapon before . Not in all the years we 've been here . Until we used it against them to harvest the crops . We taught them . And tonight they learned . Stop talking about them as though they 're human . When the fields were on fire , Margaret was calm , but the males in the lab became highly aggressive , as if they knew what was happening . - So , if they did have a plan- - - They had no plan ! The crops , tell me . The flame took the plants down to the root . The Earth is scorched . Replanting on that ground will take months , if the Abbies even let us . So we only have the food that 's currently in the storehouse . [ Jason ] No . Plant something that grows quickly . - It won 't work . - What are you saying ? That we will starve to death ? Every human on the planet starves to death ? How long ? If nothing changes , less than six weeks . [ Jason ] Today , we mourn the loss of 35 members of this town . Thirty-five members of our species . It 's easy . It 's easy to wake up in the morning and forget who we are . It is easy to forget that there are no more second chances for humanity . That this is it . That we are it . I 'm told that people used to tell stories . Stories that mankind began with only two people , a man and a woman . Now we number 1178 . So today , I believe , that if we rose from two , we can rise from this . We are the hope of mankind . We will survive . For those lost , and for the future . [ soldier ] Present arms ! Ready ! Aim ! Fire ! [ gunshot ] Ready ! Aim ! Fire ! [ gunshot ] Ready ! Aim ! Fire ! [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] - Here you go . - Thank you . Fellows , Wayward Vine ? We 're collecting the weapons that were commandeered from the armory last night . I need yours . Commandeered ? No , no , I 'm afraid I don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh , wait . You mean the ones that we used to save your asses , you mean those weapons ? - Yeah . - ' Cause I do have one of those . I won 't discover that you kept some for yourself ? No , I mean we got no food . Abbies just killed a few dozen people . We can 't have citizens running around able to defend themselves , can we ? That 's your job . You 're doing great , by the way . Toss the place , if you want . You have a nice day . Those shirts ... I always thought they were an odd choice of color . Brown . Of course , I guess , all you first gens aren 't exactly up on your history . Do not discuss the past and all that . I know history . I know your history . Crashed out of the marines , drug dealer given a second chance , Pilcher chose everyone for a reason . Yours was resourcefulness . But instead of using that skill to ensure the preservation of our species , you use it to help yourself . How is business , Xander ? You know where I could find any pills , any extra rations ? People are scared about food so I 'm sure there 's a nice profit to be made . I know who you used to be . And history , I know it repeats itself . Dr. Yedlin . How are the wounded ? Five are still critical . Three , we just discharged today . You 're about to have a much bigger problem and that 's medication . Steroids , antibiotics , they 're all dangerously low . Seems like your Lord and Saviour , Pilcher , did not bring enough , nor did he make any provisions to generate pharmaceuticals . Now , I think I can probably synthesize a very , very basic form of penicillin in the lab- - Pilcher thought we would be treating things like ... ear infection and strep throat . He never anticipated that we would have so many war injuries , or that we would go through so much medication so fast . What did he anticipate ? How low are the supplies ? It 's not an exaggeration to say that people could soon be dying of a sinus infection . Tetanus certainly . And if a major flu came , it would have a devastating effect . The food crisis , we need to find a way forward . A way of surviving the shortages . With the Abbies in retreat once again- - I 'm afraid that 's no longer the case , sir . In the last two hours , the Abbies have re-entered the valley outside the fence . [ beeping ] Roughly 100 in our whole territory immediately outside our borders . See , they learned from us . They learned that the fields were important , they learned how to use fire , they faked retreat , ambush us and now they cut off our escape . Ambush , retreat , these are concepts these things don 't understand . This is distracting us from the problems we already have . When are you gonna realize that this is the problem ? Then what , Dr. Yedlin ? The Abbies should inherit the Earth ? You are here as a doctor , not as a military advisor , you 'd do well to remember that . How are we gonna survive ? [ beeping ] - I was expecting Pilcher . - He 's busy , he sent me . Don 't worry , I walked and I wasn 't followed . Would you even know if you were ? He said it was done and it is . Ethan won 't be a problem for you or for us . He belongs to the future . And she 's yours . You can have the life you always wanted . I heard you wanted to call it off . Why ? I thought you loved her . That doesn 't make it right . [ woman ] Alright , nice to see you . [ indistinct chatter ] [ man ] Anything else or is that it ? [ indistinct chatter ] [ indistinct chatter ] What is the matter with you ? You 're gonna have to help me out here . I saw you go into the alley . Jason 's already thrown you outside the fence once . Becca . The guns , I understand and I helped you with that . But if you kept some , or you stole more pills- - Apples . Excuse me ? I gave him apples . Dale and his wife have got three little kids , and I figured they could use the extra food from the shop more than I could . I 'm keeping my head down . If the world 's gonna end , I 'm gonna go out strong . We weren 't nothing . Becca . I know we had our problems , but ... there were good times , too . You know that . People can change . What they want and what they need , it can change . They don 't want us to be human in here but ... it happens . Maybe you can ask your other husband if he knows what I mean . And maybe you can tell me when I 'm coming back home . [ beeping ] Theresa . I 'm so sorry . You weren 't supposed to follow Ethan . I just wanted us to be together . I 'm so sorry that ... That I couldn 't protect you . That I ... I couldn 't save you . [ sobbing ] That I did save you . It 's okay . It 's okay . Happy Birthday , sweetie . [ long beep ] [ dramatic music playing ] Dr. Yedlin . [ Abby growling ] I 'm sorry we started without you . I know you 've been busy . It 's horrible what happened outside the fence . So many lives lost . Well , now we 're gonna starve to death . Well ... That makes our work that much more important . What 's the progress ? I am conducting an MRI as per the very thorough research guidelines you sent over . With the crops gone and the Abbies amassing outside , we have to understand why this one is so docile , when the others all want to kill us . Wouldn 't you agree ? Yes , that 's why I told you to do it . Margaret holds the key , I firmly believe that . Still an animal ... of course , but there is something exquisite about her . Now what precisely are we looking for ? - I assume it is- - - Temporal gyrus . Advanced thought and problem solving , center of language for her brain . I still have trouble with the notion - that these creatures such as- - - Ah . What is it ? The temporal gyrus for a chimp is about a third the size of human 's . And hers appears to be double the size of ours . Do you think she can understand us ? L ... I have a spare bedroom at my place . I mean ... I ... I wouldn 't impose , I just ... thought maybe ... I 'd give you your privacy . You got any other pains I should know about ? We were never close . [ Theo ] I wanna ask you something . You 're the only one who has seen how they live , how they move . Do they communicate in any way , that you 've seen ? I know they 're largely violent , but it seems that they have purpose . We 've done some preliminary tests with the female . - And it seems to me- - - Did you say female ? How do you know about the females ? They have one . Up in the mountain lab . There 's a female Abby in this town ? Her palm , does it have a mark ? A raised mark , it 's like a brand . Tell me . [ Abbies roaring in the distance ] [ Abbies roaring in the distance ] [ Abbies roaring in the distance ] [ Abbies roaring ] [ Abbies roaring ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ Abbies roaring in the distance ] [ roaring ] [ beeping ] [ Abbies roaring in the distance ] [ roaring ] [ roaring ] [ Abbies roaring in the distance ] We 're safe , right , Dr. Yedlin ?

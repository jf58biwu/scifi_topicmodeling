 Previously on Wayward Pines . This fake little town is all that 's left . There 's a faction . They 're gonna take down the fence . Surrender your arms and explosives by tomorrow morning ... and everything stays between us . Wayward Pines needs a new generation . You and Ben look so nice together . How is that working out ? It 's great actually . You were right . They got to Ethan . - We execute tonight . - Who 's that ? Ted Laufer . He drives the delivery truck . It 's always right on time , right at 8 : 00 . Okay , let 's go . Help ! I need a doctor . Help ! Come here . Come here . - I need a doctor . - Sir , we can help ? Okay , hold that . What happened ? - Truck exploded . - Prep Radiology- - now ! - Oh , my God ! - Wait a minute . - Is this guy a real doctor ? - Of course he is . We need to move . Ben will receive the best possible care . You know the children are our most precious resource . Fifteen to ICU , please . Try to remain calm if you 're able . There you go . - Hey . - Oh , my God . Ah . Here 's Dr. Carol . So far , I see no significant injury to his brain ... but we won 't know exactly where we stand until he regains consciousness . - But he 's gonna be okay ? - If he comes to in the next 24 hours ... the odds of a full recovery are very good . It could be a long night . Try to get some rest . What kind of person sets off a bomb in the middle of town ? I told him to stay home . I did . Hey . It 's not your fault . He 's just a kid . He 's 14 . Do you remember what you were like ? Do you think he 's involved with any of this ? No . If you need anything at all ... - just press this buzzer , all right ? - Thank you . - Oh ! Dr. Jenkins . - How are the children ? Amy Breslow 's gonna be all right ... all things considered . Ben Burke is still unconscious ... but not to worry , Dr. Carol is with him . He 's absolutely going to pull through . How have they been able to do this ? Settle yourself down now . Remember where you are for God 's sake , David . W-W-We put out an issue of the Chronicle . We explain this as a ‒ an explosion , as a gas leak . Yes . It 's a fine idea . I just hope they buy it . I 'm worried about the townsfolk . And people have already started talking . I think we should do something for them , something very , very special . - For the entire community . - A celebration ? Yes . Yes , a celebration of life in Wayward Pines . Remind everybody exactly how blessed we actually are . Hmm ? This is internal bleeding . It 's bad . - We should keep moving . - No . No , we have to stay here and wait for the others . - No one 's coming , Harold . - We don 't know that . And he is not gonna survive another move . Here they come . Thank God . There 's some food , water and first aid in there . - Wait , what 's Ruby doing ? - She had to go back . She can 't risk showing up late for work . What happened to Eric ? He got pinned between the truck and the Dumpster . - We should take him down to the hospital . - So they can execute him ? What happened at the fence ? Two got away , four got taken ... - and Kate 's in jail . - Oh , my God . Look , I really want to help you guys , but I can 't stay . Sorry . I want ... to get out ... of this town ! Why ? Because none of it 's real . It 's a ‒ It 's a Potemkin village . They have them in Syria , North Korea . They 're fake cities built to impress . Yes , it is . Who 's behind it ? CIA ? Is it social or medical ? - What ? - This government experiment . Is it social or medical ? It 's just a town . Just a town ? With an electrified fence ? W-W-W-With a microchip in my leg ? You have to write that down , huh ? I 'm just noting your progress . I 'm not making any progress . I don 't wanna make any progress . I wanna talk to someone in charge now ! It 's been two months . I-I am sorry . Oh . Poor Katie . Not feeling so well , eh ? Don 't worry . We 'll get you all fixed up . That 's a good girl . Oh . Shh , shh , shh ‒ Heard the driver and two kids are still in the hospital . If that was the gas line , then how come the asphalt wasn 't damaged ? Only thing exploded was the truck . Had to be a bomb . What do you think , Dr. Jenkins ? Well . When a disaster like this occurs ... in a town as beautiful as ours ... it 's natural for folks to ask questions . But- - we should be careful not to spread rumors . Hello ? Who is it , Ruby ? A fellowship gathering . Mandatory attendance . Give me a reading on Ruby 's chip . She was late to work . Pine needles in her hair . She 's at home in bed . Let me see . She must have taken her chip out last night and left it in her room . I wonder how many more people are home in bed . All right , where are they , Kate ? Five of your people are off the grid right now , including Harold . You think I 'm gonna help you find my husband ? Your husband blew up a truck last night on Main Street . Nearly killed my son . Ben ? Wh-What are you talking about ? Is ‒ Is he gonna be okay ? Don 't even say his name . Just tell me where they are ! I am so sorry , Ethan . Something must have gone wrong with the timer . It was meant to go off at the fence . Well , that 's the last thing that we need to have happen . You know what the difference is between you and me ? I believe what I know in my heart . You believe what they tell you . I know you don 't get it . I know you think they got to me . But I know what 's out there , and it 's not Boise . You ever think about why they picked you to be sheriff ? 'Cause I have . I 'm gonna take you up there so you can see it with your own eyes . - But we don 't have time for that now . - See what , the monsters ? Where are they ? You have really good instincts , Ethan ... but when push comes to shove , you will always follow orders . You have made the same mistake before . Well , I 'm not following orders this time . I 'm just trying to make sure that nobody gets killed . What happened to you ? We were partners . Don 't you trust me at all ? These people wanna be free . And I owe them that chance . Amy is holding steady ... and Ben Burke looks like he 'll pull through . Ruby 's one of them . Ruby ? Have you , uh , notified Ethan Burke ... she needs to be locked up ? We need to put our own house in order first . I 'm not following . We have 24 people manning Surveillance around the clock . Yet somehow these insurgents are managing to meet in secret and build bombs . Someone must be helping them . David . Everyone up here is family ... loyal to you to a fault . Someone 's betraying us , and we need to find out who it is . If it 'll help you to feel better ... I 'll conduct a full security review . Yes , it would help me feel better . Snipers have checked the north quadrant . All clear . You still happy with your decision to join us here ? It 's an absolute privilege to be here . Indeed , indeed . And working Surveillance ‒ Is it ever uncomfortable for you ? Do you ever feel like you 're , I don 't know , invading people 's privacy ? Uh , it 's the job . We do it to protect them , right ? Absolutely . Absolutely . - How 's Reggie ? - Very good . - And the kids ? - Full of energy , as always . Super , good . How about your post at Surveillance ? You enjoying that ? I like it a lot . But sometimes you might wanna ... I don 't know , avert your eyes , or ... maybe even wipe video ' cause of something you 've seen , erase it ? Are you kidding ? Oh , I love it when they let something juicy slip . Very good . Super . Thank you so much , Gina . - Will you send the next person in ? - Sure . Sweetie . Ben , sweetie . Hi . How are you feeling ? Water . Oh , yeah . Yeah . Here you go . Don 't lift your head . You have no idea how happy it makes me to see you open your eyes . Your dad and I were so scared . Where 's Amy ? She 's here in the hospital . Is she okay ? Yes , she 's fine . She was asking about you . Can you go check ? Yeah , sure . I will . I love you so much . How are you feeling ? Okay , I guess . Oh , Ben . Oh . Everyone in town has been so worried about you . - I 'm so relieved you 're all right . - Yeah , me too . Oh , it 's just terrible what 's happened . Sometimes the choices one makes ... can lead to consequences we don 't intend . I never should have snuck out with Amy . Oh , no , no . No , I 'm not talking about that . We want you to grow your relationships here . I 'm talking about decisions made by the sheriff in pursuing the case . He 's a good man , Ben . He 's well-intentioned . And I 'm sure he had his reasons ... for letting Harold Ballinger go . I just hope his judgment wasn 't clouded by the fact that ... Harold 's wife is an old friend of his . Kate and your father are friends , right ? Yeah , sort of . He arrested Harold , and then he let him go . And then ‒ I guess I just ... don 't agree with that kind of leniency . I believe , as David Pilcher believes ... in a philosophy ... that I like to call " Clear and Severe . " Clear laws and severe punishments . " Clear and Severe . " To be honest , I think your father and I disagree on this issue . But you 're gonna have to give it some thought . People are gonna wanna hear from you . What is the proper punishment for speech or actions ... that harm Wayward Pines ? Leniency ... or " Clear and Severe " ? You say that people are gonna wanna hear what I have to say . What does it matter what I think ? Ben , you survived a terrorist attack . You 're a hero now . - How long you think we can survive out here ? - We 'll think of something . Mmm , good . That 's what people always say when they 're at the end . Hey , don 't fall apart on me . We 'll think of something . Eric . Hey . I 'm not doing this by myself . Not here . What do you mean ? I 'm not gonna let him rot for all eternity inside this prison . - What are you talking about ? - We 're not burying him here . I 'm burying him in free soil . On the other side of that fence . How you gonna do that ? You ever feel uncomfortable working Surveillance ? Thoughts , feelings , concerns about invasion of privacy- - Oh , no , no . I think our methods are well-reasoned and , uh ... necessary for the continued ... preservation of human life . Reggie . You don 't have to quote the manual here . Hmm ? Well , in that case , um ... sometimes , um , a little bit . It must be strange , peering into people 's lives all day long like that . Oh , no . It 's not that . I know we 're here to protect them . It 's just- - Sometimes people say , uh ... personal stuff . Like what ? Maybe they ask certain questions , like , uh ... " What 's outside the fence ? " Or , " Who 's watching the cameras ? " And you 're telling me you don 't record those infractions ? Look , if it 's just innocent ... then sometimes I 'll blur the tape . Or I 'll , uh , erase a spot . But I just don 't want anyone to get in trouble for just asking questions . These people are scared . You know ? I see them sobbing in their rooms , holding each other . They just don 't understand what became of their lives . It 's just human nature to ask questions . Yeah . Yeah , absolutely . Human nature . - Thank you so much for coming in , Reggie . - Yeah . This is a bad idea . The construction crew was finished for the day . Besides , who cares ? If I 'm gonna die , I 'm gonna die trying . It 's a wonderful gathering , don 't you think ? Hmm . It 's nice , bringing everyone together like this . This would make a perfect target , wouldn 't it ? Whole town together in one place ? I just came from the hospital . Ted didn 't make it . He 's dead ? Burned over 90 % of his body . Maybe you should say a few words , Mr. Mayor . Lift their spirits . That 's not a bad idea . Hey , folks . Can I have your attention , please ? Move in here , move in here , move in here . I just wanted to welcome you all to our wonderful fellowship gathering . So relax , everyone . Have some fun . Hey , say hello to your neighbor . It 's just another beautiful day in the friendliest place on Earth . Mayor , I 'd like to say a word . Sheriff Burke , ladies and gentlemen . Listen , folks . This really isn 't the best time for this . As many of you may have heard ... last night a bomb went off right here in the middle of Main Street ... not far from where you people are standing . And several of the people connected to this crime have gone missing . So until we get this situation sorted out ... I think it 's best if everybody goes home and stays safe . Let 's wrap it up , please . All right , everyone . You heard Sheriff Burke . Let 's go . Why didn 't you tell me about this ? I didn 't want to interrupt your investigation . Nothing matters more than keeping the populace calm ... a-a-a-and quiet . I 'm afraid the ship 's already sailed . Hey . - Hey . - How are ya ? You know , I had a concussion when I was your age , playing football . I got hit running a quick slant across the middle . I don 't remember too much of what happened after that . My ears were ringing for a couple days . So . I guess it hasn 't been all that much fun , huh ? - Hey . - Hi . No . I guess not . Especially considering that it all could 've been avoided . Wh-What do you mean ? You had the guy , Dad . You had him , and you let him go . Ben , what are you talking about ? Your dad saved your life . No , no , no . That 's okay . I heard ... that you arrested the guy who made the bomb ... and then you let him go . Well , there 's a reason for that . Sometimes we let a suspect walk to see where it 'll lead us . It just kind of makes me wonder ... if you would 've ‒ I don 't know , if you would 've made the same decision ... if he wasn 't married to Kate Hewson . Ben , that 's a terrible thing to say . He can say whatever he wants . You 're supposed to enforce the laws of Wayward Pines . You 're not supposed to be lenient with people because you know them . Hey . I would 've done the same thing no matter who it was . Ben . Is your teacher telling you to say all of this stuff ? - Is that what 's happening ? Is it the teacher ? - Hey , look . Ben , it doesn 't matter . Look . Ben , we love you . And we 're just- - we 're just happy that you 're okay . Get- - Get plenty of rest . - Hey . - Hey . - Hi , Amy . - Look who 's here . We 'll talk about this later . Hi . So ... no one in Surveillance is breaking any rules or protocols ? No . If there 's a problem ... it must be a software glitch . Never had to punish anyone on the inside before . No . It would be a terrible line to cross . And happily , we don 't have to . No one is helping the insurgents . Oh , no , no . That 's not what I asked . What I asked was ... is anyone in Surveillance breaking any rules or protocols ? No . Well . At least we have each other . Thank goodness for that . Did I ever tell you I wanna be a nurse here when I grow up ? No . That 's cool though . I can hear your heart . Yeah , well , I 'd hope so . Boom , boom . Boom , boom . Boom . It 's getting faster now . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . It 's just a headache . I 'm actually not supposed to be leaving my bed . Well , I 'm glad you 're okay . I 'm glad you 're okay . I never really thought about it before , but ... last night made me realize how ... at any day , any point ... we could just die . We didn 't . We 're alive . I think that teacher Megan 's been whispering in his ear . I can just feel it . I can 't stop thinking about what he just said . About how I had the guy and then I let him go . That 's what happened with the Easter bombings . This now just in to the newsroom . We are getting live video feed — Terrorist attacks in DC and Los Angeles at the same time . On an Easter day , when so many families- - I gotta go in . Ethan , do you know something about this ? - No . - Please tell me what 's going on . I could never tell you . I was part of a joint terrorism task force ... and we got word that Narwaz was down in Mexico . So we went down , we grabbed him ... secured him ... put him on a plane to transport him back to DC . Then I got a call from headquarters . They told me to let him go . The guy is dirty . I knew he was dirty . " Let him go . " Well , that 's exactly what I did . It was an order . And then , three weeks later ... 621 people are murdered . By Narwaz Al-Salaam . And I had the guy . And I let him go . And it was classified . You know how bad I wanted to tell you ? That 's why you went to Kate . It was the toughest period of my life . She was there . She was my partner . There 's no excuse for what happened after that . I 've been sorry about it ever since . I 'm not blindly following orders anymore . Sheriff . I 'm sorry . Yeah . We have an emergency call from the truck depot . Yeah , I 'll check it out . Thanks . Thank you for telling me . I love you . Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to startle you . I came to check up on Ben . How 's he doing ? You don 't have any children of your own , do you ? Brad and I have not been so blessed . You do realize that Ben is our son and not yours ? Theresa , we are on the same team . Are we ? Because I 'm starting to feel like every single thought that you put into Ben 's head ... is meant to undermine us . Let 's be honest here . You 've got an agenda , and I wanna know what it is . You 're starting to sound a little paranoid , Theresa . I simply believe that the children of Wayward Pines ... are the future of Wayward Pines . And to that end , I try to be as helpful as possible . Helpful , right now ... would be for you to stay very far away from my family . Hey , Sheriff . - So what happened ? - I got here about an hour ago . Someone smashed one of our cameras ... cut the lock ... stole one of our trucks . - What kind of truck was it ? - A 30-foot dump truck . What 's going on , Sheriff ? Is there gonna be another bomb ? Maybe the truck is the bomb . What about the nightmares ? Nothing ... the last few years . Any explanation for that ? Acceptance , I suppose . In my life before , I was always running ... searching , fighting . But the questions I had then ... are no different than the questions I have now . Why are we here ? Why do we breathe in and out ? Is there a God ? But if I 'm honest ... in my old life ... there was also a great degree of fear . There was terror everywhere . It 's what my job as an agent was all about . And I won 't lie ‒ I fed on that adrenaline . But here ‒ I don 't know , it 's as if I 've been ... forced to live one moment at a time . I 'm still asking all the same questions , but ... the answers are less urgent now . Maybe because I feel safer . Hmm . Have you and Harold , uh , thought any more about children ? Hmm . We have been talking about it , yes . You 'd make a great mom , Kate . Hmm . Oh . Can I get that refill ? Oh . Uh , yeah . - Thank you , Dr. Jenkins . - Thank you , Kate . Hmm . Dr. Jenkins . Why didn 't you come and talk to me before all this ? You know I couldn 't do that . Besides , what would you have said ? Forget the truth ? Your friend Ted has died . Two of our young are seriously injured in the hospital . Others are missing . That 's the price of your truth . You know it 's not like that . You didn 't mean for anyone to die . How many more need to be sacrificed ? I thought you were happy . I thought we made progress . I know you did . How can you be so cheerful with neighbors ... you 're putting into lethal danger ? Only a fanatic could be so callous . Are you sure you 're talking about me ? Because it sounds like you 're talking about yourself ... David Pilcher . How long have you known ? Doesn 't matter . Just , please ... tell me what this place is . You were its model citizen . I thought that if I could make Kate Hewson conform ... then I could make anyone conform . There 'd be no more need for reckonings . Whatever you 're trying to do here ... it will never work if you keep people in the dark . It 's not a question of keeping people in the dark . It 's a question of keeping people alive . Freedom or safety . Not both . And who anointed you to make that choice ? I did . Oh . There you go . Thank you . I 'm getting you a piece of pie . Don 't want that blood sugar dropping . Security . Hey . Reggie Hudson 's been deleting surveillance footage . But you know that already . Well , he did show some sympathy for the residents but- - Did he help the people who bombed the perimeter ? No , David . Not at all . He had no idea ‒ He 's a traitor . He needs to be taken care of . " Taken care of " ? David , he ‒ he 's no traitor . How do you define " traitor " ? Is it someone who lies to the people who trust them the most ? You need to punish someone ? Is that it ? Punish me . I 'm the one who lied to you . Not Reggie . Reggie told the truth . These are our people , David . They came to us by choice , not like the people down in town ... who don 't know how they got there ... and probably will never be happy . We tolerated those reckonings . " Okay , we 'll kill one and keep the rest in line . " But if we start killing our own people ... in the name of saving humanity ... then we 've lost everything . If you need to punish , David , punish me . Kill me . There 'll be no more killings . David . We have all had to accustom ourselves ... to the meting out of punishment in Wayward Pines . But now ... we are forced to address the insubordination of one of our own . I have asked you here to bear witness . We all know Reggie Hudson . We all love Reggie . But his mistakes have led to serious injury and death ... and that can no longer be tolerated . - All right . - Okay . Got him . You ready ? It wasn 't supposed to go like this . Look , I 'm sorry about Kate . There 's nothing we can do about that now . I say we just keep driving till we hit San Francisco . This time tomorrow , man , we 'll be drinking beers by the bay . - I can 't . - You gotta be kidding me . I can 't leave without her . Hey . You change your mind ... you know where I 'm gonna be until the sun goes down . Good luck . Harold ! Last warning , Harold . Get on your knees . Put your hands up . Get up . You almost killed my son . I swear to you it was an accident . We just wanted to get out . Where are the others ? No , it 's just me . I 'm the only one you want . - I planned the whole thing . - Where are they ? - Are you listening to me ? - No , you listen to me . I 'm about this close ... to letting them cut your wife 's throat in the middle of Main Street . Where are they ? You 're too late . These are dangerous times- - for all of us . Everything we 've risked our lives for ... will be destroyed . We 're entering a time of war ... where new rules must be applied . Security must be tightened ... protocols reinforced . Everything we 've achieved ... has been due to your hard work . But we 're battling terrorists . So stay alert , stay vigilant . Report anything suspicious . I got ya . We made it , buddy . Ah ! We made it !

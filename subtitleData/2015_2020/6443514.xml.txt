Jesus Christ , Kate , they shot me in the dick ! They shot me in the dick ! They 've shot me in the dick ! What is this place ? It 's Goldenmire 's basement . I 'm using it for my research . Oh ! Oh , no , - don 't touch that . - Why ? - Seriously , just don 't touch it . So , parallel universes . Right . Er , yeah . So , I studied physics . Got a PhD , got a lot of funding ... - MACHINE WHIRS - .. for a research project . Things were going really well . I 'd been doing some research into parallel universes and how a person might jump into one . So I built this crude prototype ... which , er , didn 't work . But it did find an area of unusual activity , somewhere here . Every single ion in this area is , erm ... inverted , I suppose you 'd call it . Which is against the laws of physics . That 's the graveyard in front of the church . I mean , in my wilder moments , I 've often wondered if it 's , erm ... some kind of a gateway . And if we can just find the way to push through ... - Then what ? - Hmm ? - If you can finally find a way to push through ... ? - Oh . There wasn 't really an end to that sentence . Just , erm ... that would be really cool , basically . Slowly , from the top , using normal words , - tell me what you know . - OK . But we 're going to need biscuits . [ HE SOBS ] It 's numb ! It 's the shock . I can 't feel anything . Why would someone shoot me in the dick ? I don 't think they were aiming for your dick . They were trying to kill you . Just calm down . - Calm down ? Calm down ? ! How calm would you be if someone shot you in the vagina ? - Don 't be gross . Oh , I 'm sorry ! But I love my penis , Kate ! I love it . It 's not the biggest , it 's not the best , I don 't get to use it all that often , but Christ , it 's mine . It 's mine . Why is someone shooting at me all the time ? ! Can 't find it . Oh , God , it 's gone . Is it all gone ? It 's all gone ? The wound . You haven 't been shot . But ... my jeans . Must be someone else 's blood . Can you pull my jeans up , please ? So , what you 're saying is , you need money ? - And three months . - Three months here ? Jesus Christ . My wedding ... Would you come with me to meet the other traveller I was telling you about ? He should be able to get you all the money you want . - He is Milo Edwards , after all . - Milo Edwards ? O-M-G , I love him ! And he 's so hot . Is he that hot in real life ? Because those eyes ... I could swim in them . You hook us up with a way out of here and I promise you all the eye-swimming you want . Come on , let 's go . Oh , fucksticks . Go ! Go ! GO ! HE GROWLS Well . I don 't know about you , but I could really do with a beer right ... - OK , who are you ? - Whoa ! - Cos you 're sure as shit not Milo Edwards . Who are you ? You 're all from different universes , right ? That 's why there are so many of you and you keep coming back . Am I sort of in the right ballpark here , or ... ? I 'm important enough for you to want me dead . And not just me , but every version of me and Milo in existence . No , we don 't want all of you dead . Just two of you . You 're a slippery pair . So that 's why we 're killing all of you . Might be a sledgehammer for a small nail approach , but not my call . Whose call is it ? You think I 'm bad ? Oh , there 's a version of me ... Even I 'm fucking terrified of him . He 's our leader . So let me give you a word of advice . You can 't win . Running will only postpone your painful and inevitable demise Give up now and I promise I will make it quick and painless ... ish . That 's not advice , that 's you asking me nicely if you can kill me ! Can 't say I didn 't offer . HE PANTS AND WHIMPERS Come on . Come on . Come on ! - Why have you have you got a gun ? - Everyone has a gun ! Yeah , so it appears . Since when ? - Since Prime Minister Farage said we could . - Farage ? - The guy with the weird ties ? The Ukip guy ? - Who are you ? ! - I 'm Milo Edwards . Who else would I be ? - OK . Well , the Milo Edwards I know has a tattoo of the Venus de Milo on his penis . Calls it his Penis de Milo . [ HE CHUCKLES ] Sorry , that is classic me , that . - Penis de Milo - - that is genius . - Except you don 't have the tattoo . - I had it removed ! - Oh , what , completely lasered off your dick ? That is way too painful to be possible . Maybe it wasn 't real in the first place and I just put it there - to impress the ladies . - You were different before . You were more confident , more handsome . Just cooler . - I 'm cool ! - No . I mean , you 're a good likeness , I 'll give you that . And it was probably worth a lot of money , pretending to be him . But I took a strand of your hair from the limo and I sent it to be tested for DNA . All right , listen , listen , I 'll tell you everything . But I 've been shot at twice in the past 24 hours and they 're almost certainly coming back to finish the job . So I 'd just really like to get out of here before I get shot at again . That 'd be great . BELL CHIMES Where 's the bloody gateway ? So that 's what you 're going with ? A parallel world ? It 's the truth ! Two shots of tequila . Thanks . Look , I know . I know it sounds crazy , but where I 'm from , I picked the Transformer . - What you on about ? - The big story about Milo Edwards when he was a kid , and the choice between the Transformer and the guitar ? I picked the Transformer . This guy picked the guitar , and hey presto , rock star . That 's the same story he used to tell . But he didn 't pick the guitar . He picked the Transformer . But that 's what I did . I did that . - Why 's he so famous ? - Because he decided that 's what he wanted . - You know , he worked at it . He practised . - But there had to have been , like , a thing . Like , he broke his leg so he had to stay at home and practise . I 'm just saying there has to be a point where realities diverged . You make choices , Milo . What to do , what not to do . And you live with them . That 's all . You can 't blame anyone but yourself for how your own life turns out . PHONE RINGS Hello . And ? There 's a ... Yeah , er ... OK , yeah , thanks . Thanks for telling me . That was the lab calling with the DNA test results . - Listen , I can explain ... - It 's a 100 % match . Three independent tests . You 're ... - You 're Milo Edwards . - I 'm Milo . I told you ! I told you this . So why have you been spinning me all this absolute bullshit about parallel worlds ? ! You had a gun ! You 've got a gun pointing at me . I thought you wanted me to say something . So I was saying something ! We are going to need a lot more shots . Yeah . It 's him . Milo ? Milo . Milo ! - Oh , hey , hey . - What happened ? Oh , I don 't know . - I was shot at again ! - Again ? ! - And I thought it was my dick . But it turns out that one of my fans got shot in the shoulder . They 're OK , but it was really , really close . So you 're fine , good . Now listen - - I found Callum . And the one from here - - I shit you not - - is this mad genius and he 's been researching parallel universes ... Oh , my God ! Can you two lovebirds please keep it down ? Ugh , I feel horrendous . DOOR SLAMS SHUT SHE RETCHES You had sex with her ? - I don 't think so . - You don 't think so ? I don 't really remember . You might have had sex with my fiancee and you don 't remember ? ! So what if I did or I didn 't ? Jesus Christ , Danny , it 's not all about you . What is that supposed to mean ? You don 't like it that I 'm somebody here . That I 'm the one people are looking at . Don 't be ridiculous , it 's not even you ... That 's why you ran off to Goldenmire without me . While I got shot at , by the way . The Callum with a sword showed up , Milo , I almost got killed ! You just can 't handle the fact that I am famous and that Kate choose me , because everything has to be about you ! Screw you , Milo ! DEVICE FAILS , SPUTTERS Did you just ... ? I was angry . You just pressed the button . - I didn 't ? - Yeah . You did . It 's ... it 's broken anyway . It got pretty smashed up during the fight . You were going to leave without me ? How could you ... how could you do that ? What sort of friend does that ? Are we even ... ? Are we even friends any more , Danny ? I don 't know . I honestly don 't know . You got the names of everyone here ? And he definitely checked in today ? Daniel Gates ? - Yeah ? - Put your hands behind your back . - Excuse me ? - Hands ... Behind ... Back . - Why ? - You 're under arrest . But I ... Hang on , no , no . I haven 't done anything ! Hey ! I was sat on the cough in my PJs with a slice of granary , and I 'm looking at the TV and I 'm like , " Erm , excuse me ? " What is my best friend of all time Danny doing shooting people " at a press conference ? " Do you know what I mean ? I 'm like , what ? ! Like , phew , I ... " Are you going to call the police , Paul ? " Er , yeah , I think I AM going to call the police because I don 't want that kind of shit on my streets . Crime ! Well ... thanks for your help . Sayonara . Unbelievable . Lunatics and morons . What 's going on ? Is anyone going to tell me why I 've been in here all night ? - Let 's start with why you tried to shoot Milo Edwards . - Me ? Shoot Milo ? Why would you think that I would want to ... I knew you 'd be back . I knew it ! Oh , God ! KNOCK ON DOOR Kate ? KNOCKING CONTINUES Milo ? Danny , look mate , about last night ... I didn 't ... Oh , wrong Danny . - What do you mean ? - What are you doing here ? How did ... how did you get past security ? I 'm really sorry about this , Milo ... but I sort of killed them . - ' Scuse me ? - Am I mumbling ? I killed them . Just like I killed you four years ago . Oh , you 're properly fucking crazy . So it 's been said . But I find labels so constrictive . Don 't you ? You can stop denying it , Mr Gates . - Your old friend Paul told us everything . - Fucking Paul . He told us about the death threats you 've been sending Milo Edwards . You don 't understand , there is somebody out there who looks exactly like me , he ... Oh ! Your lucky day . It 's your lawyer . Dad ? You 're lucky they have no concrete evidence right now , it 's nothing but circumstantial . You disappointment me , son . Are you high on spliff and whatnot ? No , Dad , I 'm not high on spliff and whatnot . " Hwa-yakeul ji-go bool sok-euro deoreo-kanda . " It 's a Korean proverb . It means , " An insect falling into the gunpowder and entering the fire . " Since when did you speak Korean ? It means you 're asking for trouble . Word of advice - - get far away from here before they find proof of your guilt . Dad , I really hope there 's a universe out there where you 're not a complete dick . But I 'm not holding my breath . Now if you 'll excuse me , I 've got someone who needs my help . Thanks very much for getting me out of prison though . I knew you were special the day I met you . Special ? Yeah , well - - you 're not the first person to call me that recently . I knew there was a reason our paths crossed . And now here you are - - back from the dead ! My big , sexy butterfly . If you think I 'm so great , why do you want to kill me ? I 'm helping you , you ungrateful bastard ! Helping you cross back to the land of the dead , to set you free ! - So basically you 're insane . - You 're magic , Milo ! How else could that suicide note appear in your handwriting months after I stripped you of your flesh and wore it like a cape ? Wait - - if you didn 't write the suicide note , who did ? ♪ I 'm a firewire junkie ♪ I touch the sky ♪ I 'm a firewire junkie , flying high I 'm a firewire junkie ... ♪ All right , If you 're going to kill me , just do it . Cos it 's got to be better than whatever you 're doing right now . Milo , I just got arrested for trying to shoot you at your press conference . That weird fan must be ... - Here ! - Oh , God . - You interrupted my song , mister . Wait , I don 't understand . What happened to me ? To you ? - Why are you so obsessed with Milo ? - Obsessed ? Save that for the teenage girls . I WORSHIP you , Milo . When we first met at school , I was foolish enough to think that I was the special one . And then I heard you sing . Yeah , I was jealous at first . But then I knew it was my destiny to follow you until the day I roasted you on my home-made spit . - You ... ? - Oh , Jesus Christ , this me is mental . Milo , before you go , tell me , what was it like ? - Being dead ? - Hang on ... Aren 't you a BIT surprised to see me ? I mean , I 'm you . It 's another you . I would be if you 're really here . But you 're in my mind . Right . OK , yeah . So , if I 'm in your mind , then you won 't mind if I just come over here and ... - Don 't fucking touch me , spirit ! - GUNSHOT - They all carry guns here , see . - I noticed . You saved my life . And you came back to save mine . I think we should hug . - OK . - Yeah . I 've never killed anyone before . - You didn 't have a choice . - No . Morning . I thought we could probably both do with a ... Holy shit ! OK , breathe , yeah ? Just breathe . Look , I know you 're not going to believe this , but this isn 't your Milo , Kate . Your Milo was killed . Ugh ! He 's already given me all this parallel world bullshit ! Look at this guy , Kate . Really look at him . You look the same . We ARE the same . Daniel Gates . Same address . Same date of birth ... What the fuck ? So what are we going to do here , Dan ? You said you met another Callum ? Yeah , he said he found some quantum shit or something . - " Quantum shit . " - Yeah , it made more sense the way he explained it . But basically he said that there 's like an area , and there could be a gateway there , or something ? Look , I looked all over there . There 's nothing there . It 's a dead end . It 's the graveyard in front of the church . This is where I fingered Stacey Flatley . It was written on the suicide note . " I 'll be back on the other side , where I fingered Stacey Flatley " . - It was written on the back , right , Kate ? - Right ? - This must be a clue . - From who ? I have no idea . But look , Crazy Danny didn 't write the suicide note , and nor did Rock Star Milo , cos , well , he didn 't commit suicide . And Kate said it turned up after months . What if there 's another Milo out there and he 's trying to help us ? No-one wants you to be right about this more than I do , but there 's nothing there ! I looked all over . - Did you climb the tree ? - No . Why would I climb the tree ? - Cos that 's where you ... - Fingered Stacey Flatley . - Can you please stop saying fingered ? - She asked me to . It was very respectful . As respectful as fingering a girl up a tree can be , I suppose . I 'm calling the police , because there is a dead guy on the floor and two guards out in the hall that I 'm starting to think might not be sleeping . - They 'll take us to prison . - Well , you 'd better run . It was ... it was right here . Yeah , it was right here . Shit , there has to be something around here . Milo . - Unless Callum got it wrong , but then why ... - Milo ! Your legs . Oh-ho-ho-ho ! Oh-ho-ho-ho ! Is this a good idea ? - We don 't know where it leads . - Mmm , but it 's not here , Danny-boy . GIRL : Hello ? - What the hell ? - Ahh ! Hey , calm down , don 't touch ... ! Gah ! Did that girl have a device ? Yes , and a T-shirt with my face on it . You know the world where I 'm a rock star ? She must 've come from there . - Fucksticks . - It 's OK , it 's OK . - Maybe the other us will find the gateway ... - Where does that one go ? Shit . If they go through that gateway , Danny ... Well , then we need to find them . Before it 's too late .

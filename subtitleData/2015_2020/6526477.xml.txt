To conduct a security review of self-aware clones , not screw our product . Because they will kill you . What do you want ? Wow . Dr. Moreau . I love this book . Sorry . Um ... Who else knew about the book ? Because CASTOR knew exactly what they were looking for . Your resignation is accepted . You might need this when you 're out in the cold . You need to translate that . Or else we send you back to Delphine . " In London town , we all fell down ... " Thank you , Rachel . Sorry to raise any false hopes . - London . - What do you mean ? Well , the bit Rachel translated , it points to London . To the CASTOR original . We need to get to him first . Are we going home ? Not exactly Knightsbridge , is it ? I thought we were meant to be in the old neighborhood . My old neighborhood , chicken . Before I took you lot in . Get walking . Left foot . Right foot . Works the same this side of the pond . - Terry ? - At the back , love . Are we meeting someone already ? No time to waste . We have to track down CASTOR , so I called an old friend . Twenty years ago , he helped to find you . Siobhan , the bomb . You ain 't changed a day . Sarah , Felix . Terry . - All right ? - Got my message ? Yeah , of course I did . Exact make and model requested . Consider it my " Welcome home " . Better get some pints , get into it then . Now you 're talking . You three sit tight . I 'll be back in a jiff . You get right down to business , don 't ya ? When we find the CASTOR original , there 's only one way this could go . I 'm going to kill him . Ripped By mstoll All fowl have feathers , some feathers are brown . Conclusion , all fowl is brown . False . Some poisons are pills , all pills are purple . Conclusion , all poisons are purple . All poisons are purple . True or false ? How long do I have ? Our best cryptographers are working to crack the Duncan code . We 'll find the original CASTOR . Ha ! Very good . You are fierce warrior . You will win this competition . Oscar says I am too small . Oh , small is good . Small is a weapon . You stand this close . When I hit , you block . Then you look me in the eyes , and you punch ! I am choking , so you come where I am vulnerable . Squeeze . Helena ? We don 't do things like that anymore . Remember ? I don 't think I 'm allowed . No , of course not . I am a mother now , I walk a different path . So we slipped you out of the orphanage . - Do you remember that ? - Mmm , sort of . I remember being at your house in the country and ... - Nah , nah , it weren 't mine . - No ? Just one of the few places we had back then . What do you mean ? Like safe houses ? Where you were , like , hiding fugitives ? Yeah . And a place for Carlton to shag your mother . No ! - What ? - No , enough of that . - What was that ? - Yeah . Look , the reason we 're here goes back to those days . I want you to just have a look at this , and see what you make of it . " In London town , we all fell down . " Who are you after ? Bleedin ' Mother Goose ? Could be . I don 't know what this other shite is . But I 'll tell you this , this here number , it says that this CASTOR fellow is a guest of Her Majesty 's . What do you mean ? That 's a prisoner 's number ? Yeah . Lifer , long stretch . See , only the old geezers had this kind of tag . Changed the numbering system in the ' 80s . Reckon you want a name for this bloke , yeah ? We want a name . And as soon as you can get it . I 'll talk to a mate , see what I can find out . Yeah ? All right . It shouldn 't take long . Cheers . Oh , hi ! Could you just put that on the table there with all the other stuff ? Goodness ! I think I will need a few more of these . Oh , Gracie , before you go . The body-butter recipe is on ... Is on the bulletin board over there . And please , please , could you go in today ... Actually , Mrs. Hendrix , I have a doctor 's appointment this afternoon . Oh , of course . Yes , take the day off . - Thank you . - Good . Okay , that 's good . So , where is my husband ? Where ... Where is Donnie ? Hi , honey . Sorry , I got up early to go for a run . Oh ! But you didn 't come to bed last night . You know what ? My stupid sinus was whistling again , so I decided to just sleep on the couch . Are you all right ? Yeah , no , I am fine . I think I just , um , pulled a hammy . Okay . But please , please , go by the store today . I am on the trail all day , and we 're short-handed , okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm on it . - Thank you . - I love you . Hello ? Oh , God . So , I am thinking huevos rancheros at the counter . Mmm . Uh , well ... What ? What was that ? Huevos . You just quit your job , so I am buying extra salsa for you . I can 't , actually , today . I 've got all this , um , paperwork . Exiting-clause bullshit . - Is everything okay ? - Mmm-hmm . You feeling okay ? Give me your forehead . Yeah . No , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Just got to go . - I 'll call you later , okay ? - Okay . Shit ! We 're closed . Okay . Yeah , all right . Okay , I hear you . Come in . That looks like it hurts . - You should see the other guy . - I did . - He said you jumped him . - Jason Kellerman ? No ! I may have pushed him a little . Provoked him . We had words . Come on ! What are you doing ? Please , I just ... I just put that back . Where are the pills ? What ? Why ? Pouchy wants them back . Pouchy ? This is between me and Kellerman . - He 's got nothing to do with this . - Oh ! Come on ! Kellerman vouched for you to Pouchy , he doesn 't anymore . You 're out . Look , the pills aren 't here . I swear . Stop . Ah . What ? Nitrogen . Frozen . What 's this ? I don 't know . I 've never seen it before . Looks important . We 'll keep it until you return the entire supply to Pouchy . Mmm . Minty gleam . I suggest you do it soon . Dude , this sucks . Is this is all you have ? Schnapps ? I don 't really entertain much . Cosima , nothing in here says Shay is a spy . Except that she saw the book . You remember that ? Right before Rudy showed up . And once , she asked about Sarah . Apparently , I said her name in my sleep . But I don 't sleep-talk . Sleep-talking is creepy as shit . One thing , when Rudy showed up , he knew you were sick again . Does Shay know that ? Does she know I am morbidly ill ? Yes . Yup . Yup , it came up . Yup . I 'm such an idiot . You couldn 't have known . Yeah , well , I should have . I put everyone in danger . You , Sarah , everybody . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna eat shit . What 's the matter , Felix ? Lost your taste for egg and chips ? No , I 'm just gonna wait for them to bring me my jellied eel . I just can 't get the image of you and Carlton shagging out of my head . So that was after the late drunk-Sadler , I presume . These boys were all John 's friends . And then after he was killed , they became my family . And , yes , Carlton was a little bit more than that . - Mmm . - Well done , S. - I know . - Oi , S ! Some nerve , showing your face around here . Oi , geriatric wankers . - Ah . - Oh , Christy . - Keiran . - I love you , Siobhan . Oh , it 's so good to see you ! This is , um ... This is the band . The band ? How did you bastards even know I was here ? Trudy called . She recognized you from the pictures behind the bar . You have pictures behind the bar ? Of course she does . She used to light this place up every Friday night . - I didn 't . - Is that so ? Oh , God . Any reason why we can 't do that again ? There is every reason we can 't do it again . You 've come all this way just to say no to a song ? - Do it for us . - Please , do it . Guys , come on . Siobhan , I 've got something for you . Listen , I 'm just around the corner , so ask the barmaid for directions , yeah ? Terrance , good afternoon . Ferdinand , you scared the shite out of me . I thought that you were gonna call me if Siobhan Sadler ever came to town . We had an understanding . Yeah , we did . I was just about to . Well ? Well , they just arrived , didn 't they ? Siobhan and her two kids . What 's the purpose of this little family holiday ? I don 't know . Sightseeing , I suppose . - Reconnecting with old friends ? - Yeah . You will tell me what I want to know . That 's a bull 's-eye . Oh , it was so close . I 'd forgotten how bloody thirsty singing makes me . It was absolutely amazing , S. - Order another . - No , it 's just an excuse . So , once we find this CASTOR original ... Then I will handle it . Do we really have to kill him ? CASTOR is sterilizing women . We cannot let that happen . It 's from Terrance . Gather your brother . We 'll head out . I 'm off to my doctor 's appointment . Okay . See you later . Bye , Helena . Oh , fudge . Where ... Jesus ! Helena , what are you doing ? Your face is damaged . I was jogging . I bumped into a post . I 'm just looking for a band-aid . - A post made of fist , I think . - It was nothing . Just do me a favor . Don 't tell Alison if she calls . She 's got enough on her plate . Sit . We have to fix you . I will make the pain go away . And maybe , you will tell me some truth . Okay . Now you come to me , because now you believe your girlfriend is a mole for CASTOR . I don 't know whether she is or not . But I ... There are things about her that don 't line up anymore . Why should I help ? You resigned . You said I could never quit Dyad . You were right . I screwed up , I admit it . We 're in this bullshit together , and we both need CASTOR gone . What are you not telling me ? That Sarah 's in London right now trying to kill the CASTOR original . Oh , my God . If CASTOR did translate the book , they 're gonna be right on her heels . And we need to know who gave them that book . Then leave it with me . - Is it gonna hurt ? - Yes . - What ? That 's ... - Now , hold this . What is it ? It smells minty . This we make in convent when the nuns beat the demons from us . Oh . Never heard that story before . You have more interesting stories , Donnie Hendrix . Drug dealers and money , money , money , money . I should never have gotten involved with Kellerman , but I lost my job , and Ali really wanted to run for trustee . You do this for your family . Now I gotta get us out of it . I got to return the pills and get all our money back . And they took this tank thingy from under the counter . My babies ? Excuse me ? What ? They took eggs from inside me , made them into babies and put them frozen in the tank . I guess I never heard that story , either . Where are they ? I will find them . No . No , no , no , no . I 'll get them . Helena , these are bad people . And besides , you walk a new path , remember ? Alison won 't like this . I don 't care . It 's a dad decision , for the family . And you 're a part of it now . Terry ? Terry ? Oh , shit ! Terry ! - I 'm here , pet . It 's Siobhan . - Oh , God . I didn 't tell them nothing . Give me something to stop the bleeding . Yeah . They had me twisted out for years . Who , love ? I just ... I gave them the ace of spades . It will keep them at bay . - I 'm here . - The number ... I didn 't tell them . But you need to know . Oh , good God . Shit . Is he ... - S ? - Mum . What do we do ? We leave . We go home . S , we need to find CASTOR . We 've lost our advantage . He said he found something , what if ... Shut up ! This is not a debate . We are done . Come on , she 's right . We 're gonna go , okay ? Let 's go . Get back to the pub . I 'll take care of this . Just wait for me there . Do not move until I get there . What did he ... What did he find ? Felix , will you get her out of here ? Let 's go . Come on , Sarah . Yup . Yeah . - Bloody hell ! Let 's go ! - Coming . We 're not going back . Did you not see the dead man back there ? Yes . Which means they are getting closer . All the more reason for us to get to the bottom of this shit . - Where the hell did you get that ? - Shh ! Terry said he found summat , right ? - So ... - Terry is dead , Sarah . If we call his people , we 'll find out what it was . Look , look . Two times this number was called today . I don 't care . I don 't like this . You should have given it to S. - What do you want now ? - Uh ... - I need to see you . - Who is this ? It 's Siobhan . You gotta be kidding me . Where are you ? Few blocks east of the Bayonette . In the square in an hour . I 'll send someone . Great . That doesn 't sound ominous at all . You don 't have to come . Yeah , I do . Because I need to know you 're safe . I don 't like this . We should be doing this with S. Then go back to the pub and wait for her there . And miss our clandestine meeting with a dangerous thug ? I need to figure out what 's going on . And what 's gonna happen when he figures out that you 're not who you said you are ? Oh , that 's bloody brilliant . Yeah . You got a better plan ? You Siobhan ? Yeah . Come on then . - This is place ? - Yup , this is place . I 'll be right back . Hey . Senhor Pozinho . Good to see you again . I don 't know what , uh , Jason Kellerman told you , but we had ... Actually , you know what ? It doesn 't matter . So this is everything that we got from you . Keep the bins . I just really need that tank back . I thought you didn 't know what it was . It 's private . Okay ? All right . You know what ? It 's fertilized embryos . My wife and I are having a little trouble ... I 'm sorry , what ? My gun ... Oh , I got it . Empty gun shooting blanks . Yup , that 's me . I just need that back . And also , if you could see it in your heart , Mr. Pozinho , to reimburse us for the pills , then we 're all squared away . It 's the wife . Alison , honey , I said to wait in the car . You were taking long time . I came to check up husband . What 's up with your voice ? I have a cold . Yeah , yeah . It 's one of those really bad ones that messes with your syntax . You know what ? Why don 't you just save your voice , honey , because Louisa here is gonna give us the tank back . Oh ! So , Mr. Pozinho , what about that refund ? Vamos . You wash my money . There 's no refund , Mr. Hendrix . You work for my uncle now . Honey , we better go . We have your eggs . Come on . Hey , don 't even think about getting back in the business . We know where you live . We know where Oscar and Gemma go to school . Did you threaten babies ? Alison , honey , let 's go . Let 's just get out of here , okay ? Hey ... No , Ali , don 't do this ! Open the door ! Stop ! You should not threaten babies . Helena , don 't do this ! What are you doing here ? You expected someone else ? That 's cute . Are you alone ? That 's none of your business . And you can 't just ... What is this ? I don 't think Cosima 's coming back . Sit . Sit down ! Take off your shoes . What ? Why ? Take them off , or they will . We 're gonna have a conversation . And you 're going to tell me everything . Sarah , why are we stopping here ? Out with you , come on . - I said come on , didn 't I ? - Hey , hey ! God ! Hey ! Jesus ! We 're gonna have a nice little chat . Hey , that 's enough ! You leave him alone . I 'll let him go when you start talking ! And don 't even think about pulling that gun out of your pants . Or I 'll snap this little tosser 's neck . - You 're the one that we called , then ? - Yeah . And you 're not bleeding Siobhan , are you ? So , talk . I 'm Sarah . Right ? He is Felix . We belong to Mrs. S. To Siobhan . We 're her foster kids . Sarah Manning ? Yeah , yeah . You know me ? Yeah . I had to track you down 20-odd years back or so . I moved you about from place to place . You 're Kasov . So , where the bloody hell is your mum ? She ... She wanted Terry to help her find that prisoner . - You helped him . - Yeah . And what of it ? We need to know what you found out . A friend of mine in the parole service sent me that . Geezer 's name is Malone , went in ' 78 . " Kendall Malone . " Aggravated homicide . Parole , 2007 . There 's an address on here , it 's current . Will you take us there ? Please . Yup . It 's great , Ali . Yeah . Uh , Gracie is at the doctor 's , I think , and , um ... Yeah , yeah . I got it ... Honey , I gotta go . Helena , what did you do ? I got refund . We should go now . Crap . Get in the car . Get in the car . I don 't know how many times I have to tell you . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm not a corporate spy , Delphine . Jesus ! I 've only been to your stupid lab once . You know , for someone of your income , the lease on this place is quite expensive . It 's none of your concern how I pay for things . If the money comes from CASTOR , it is . From who ? Where is Cosima ? This is why she was acting so weird this morning . You 've gone all Single White Female on her . Delphine , why are you doing this ? This is a bit more than we were owed . I do not think they will be coming back for change . Uh , you might wanna shower before Alison comes home . Yes , I will do this . Thank you for saving my babies . Donnie , there you are . You wouldn 't believe the day I had . What happened to your face ? Well , um ... The good news is we 've come into some money . What ? - Like , a lot of money . - Oh , my God . Yeah . You know , when I was at : boarding school , there was a girl I knew very well . And she attempted suicide . She slit her wrist in the bathtub . But it wasn 't enough . She should have cut the metatarsal arteries on top of her feet too . - Hello . - Cosima . It 's Gracie Johanssen . Oh , hey , Gracie . What 's up ? I ... I just ... I just wanted to say thank you . You were ... You were very kind to me , and , um ... Please tell everyone that I 'm really sorry . Oh . What 's going on ? They told me that I could help save Mark . Oh , my God , it was you ? I 'm sorry . They told me we could be together . I love him . Scott , I made a huge mistake . You jealous bitch , you 're crazy . Tell me everything . I don 't know who CASTOR is . I 'm not working for anybody , okay ? - What is it ? - Hey , how 's it going ? Wonderful . I 'm kind of busy . What do you need ? I 'm sorry . That thing I said about Shay , it wasn 't her . It wasn 't her who took the book . Do you think someone followed us ? I don 't know . It looked like there was someone when we was a-ways back , but I lost him , didn 't I ? That one . That 's the place , that one there . Whatever you 're looking for , you better get on with it . - Thank you . - Yeah . It 's looking like old man CASTOR is sound asleep . That 'll make this easier . Jesus Christ , Sarah . You 're really gonna go in and kill an innocent old man ? You stay on the lookout . You call me if anything happens . I 'll be here Pissing my pants . Sorry , mate , ain 't taking fares . I 'm sure you 'll make an exception . Hello , Ferdinand . I won 't keep you , but you 'll never guess who I 've been traipsing around London after . Sarah Manning . Now who 's been keeping secrets from Topside . Last time I saw her , she was locked up at Dyad with you . Well , maybe we should talk . Excellent . Smooth things out between us . Balance out some of the leverage you had on me over Rachel . Why don 't you come visit the Institute ? Good idea . What are you doing in my house ? - Easy . - You 're an addict ? - Bleeding junkie ! - No , no ! I 'm looking for someone . I will sever your spine . Where you going ? Where you going ? Look , I 'm not gonna hurt you ! Oh . Can you use that thing , little brat ? - That 's the question . - I 'm looking for Kendall Malone . Well , you got me . What ? You 're Kendall Malone ? S. Put the gun down , Sarah . What ? Put it down , love . Siobhan . Hello , Mother . This is the prisoner we 're after , your mum ? Yeah , she is . Sent down for killing my john . John Sadler was a drunk and a pikey who plucked you from the cradle . I was 17 , and done with you by 12 . I didn 't know the prisoner number was hers until Terry told me . Oh . Where is CASTOR ? I 'm wondering the same thing . Tell us , Ma . Why would Professor Duncan send us to you ? I knew this would come up one day . I was just hoping I 'd be dead . I swear , Ma , you better start talking . Shit . Duncan came through , testing the inmates . Cancer research , he said . But I knew it wasn 't . He did round after rounds , men and women , looking for a viable donor . And he found one , yeah , a male donor ? Oh , he found his male . Just not where he expected . But who was it ? Did you know him ? Oh , I know him well . He 's me . What the hell are you talking about , Ma ? I 'm special , you see . Absorbed a male twin in the womb when I was formed . I got two cell lines , me . Oh , my God . She 's the CASTOR original . How 's that possible ? Hell of a twist of nature , isn 't it ? Shit . Shit , shit . Sarah , come on . S. Yeah . Time to go . - What are you doing ? - We need to destroy every shred of DNA in this house . We can 't leave a trace of her . Oh , there she goes , threatening to burn my house down again . Not just the house that has to go . Jesus , S. Said it yourself , Sarah , CASTOR has to be stopped . That 's your mum . Is this what it 's come to , Siobhan ? CASTOR and LEDA are siblings , S. - So what ? - So , if your mum has two cell lines that means that she 's our original too . We need her . She 's LEDA . Why didn 't you tell me you were in the military , Shay ? I 'm gonna give you one chance at a deal . That 's not how it 's going to work . - Five minutes max to kiss babies , okay ? Mmm-hmm . Who is keeping me here ? Ripped By mstoll

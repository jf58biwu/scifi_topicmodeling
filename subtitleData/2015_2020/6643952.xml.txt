 Previously on The Shannara Chronicles ... The Ellcrys seed must be carried to a place called Safehold . ANDER : Remember the summer you sent us to the Drey Wood fort ? - We met an Elf named Rin Katsin . - Send word to Drey Wood . I want Rin Katsin brought there immediately . - Don 't touch me ! - Something happen when people touch you ? - He 's a seer . - Ugh ! - You killed him . - It wasn 't the princess . ALLANON : It was a Changeling . It can inhabit the form of any being it chooses . ( CRUNCH ) You need to start trusting the Ellcrys . Otherwise the three of you will not make it to Safehold . ( GROWLS ) - Move out ! - ( GRUNTS ) Don 't worry . Daddy 's coming . ( EERIE MUSIC ) GIRL : Lorin , you 're too slow . LORIN : Come on . That 's not fair . You cheated . Amberle , what is it ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . I just got a leg cramp from kicking your butt so hard . ( SNIGGERS ) Yeah . I let you win . Oh , yeah ? Prove it . Last one back to the palace has to walk Manx for a month . - AMBERLE : That 's a bet . - ( STAFF TAPS ) ( GASPS ) You 're going back to the palace , alright . With me . ( ' THINK OF ME ' BY DAVID O 'DOWDA AND RACHEL WOOD PLAYS ) ( BOTH MOAN ) I 'm late for watch . And you 're going to miss the Council meeting . But I leave for Tyrsis in the morning . Diana , this is our last chance to be together . For a month . You 'll live . ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah , but when I get back , I 'll be a diplomat and you 'll be a captain . We won 't have time to fool around . - Regular power couple , huh ? - Mm-hm . But until then , Aine and Arion can handle the silver-hairs . Love trumps politics . Nice try . Get dressed . ( OWL HOOTS ) Travel safe . Always . ( LOW GROWL ) ( GROWLING ) Good evening , Prince Ander . ( GROWLS ) SONG : ♪ I feel it running through my veins ♪ And I need that fire just to know that I 'm awake . ♪ AINE : Amberle . You 're excused , Lorin . MALE ELF : How many times have I told you ... I hope you have a good explanation for being out of bed at this hour . - I 'm sorry , Father . - An apology is not an explanation . What were you doing in the Sanctuary ? It was just a dumb dare . I wanted to see if I could beat Lorin to the Ellcrys . Tell me you ran circles around that little show-off . ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) - It wasn 't even close . - That 's my girl . I bet he insisted he let you win too . AINE : Men are a predictable bunch . Even when we lie , we lack imagination . When you were a Chosen , did the Ellcrys ever speak to you ? Speak ? No . Maybe it only speaks to girls . Perhaps . Of course , there 's never been any female Chosen . But there 's no law that says a woman can 't run the Gauntlet . Maybe when you 're older , you 'll show those boys a thing or two . Amberle ? Go to your room and lock the door . Understand ? - Uh-huh . - Go . - Boy . Good boy . Come on . - ( GROWLS ) Good . You 're late , Ander . - Arggh ! - ( GASPS ) I 'm afraid the young prince is occupied this evening . Ah . Slanter , isn 't it ? Self-appointed leader of the Gnome rebellion . Your reputation precedes you . I fight for freedom , not vanity , unlike you . You 'll forgive me , but I I don 't respond to that sort of diplomacy . The time for diplomacy has passed . Now is the time for vengeance ! If you truly care about your people , lay down your weapons . Help me end this war . We will spare your life . You have our word . Enough words . ( BOTH GRUNT ) Arggh ! Ah ! Arggh ! Arggh ! - ( ROARS ) - Arggh ! - No ! - Arggh ! Your Majesty . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROWLS ) AMBERLE : No ! Father ! - ( GROANS ) - lt 's alright . It 's alright . AMBERLE : Father ! AMBERLE : How much further till we meet Rin Katsin ? A day 's ride , maybe more . We 'd make better time if we weren 't carrying - so much dead weight . - ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTS ) I think it 's marsh wolf . It 's a little gamey , but it beats ferns and dirt . Being pulled around in chains killed my appetite . Maybe if you dropped the whole lying , cheating and stealing act , you 'd find people were a little more hospitable . Thanks for the advice . I 'll talk to Amberle . Maybe we can switch to rope . Whatever Her Royal Highness commands , right ? WIL : We need to unchain her . She 's not gonna help us find the Bloodfire if we keep her dragged along like a prisoner . You sure you don 't want her hands free for some other reason ? We can make camp inside the tree line before nightfall . Wouldn 't the valley offer better visibility ? - If the Demons attack ... - My men will handle them . She 's right - you haven 't seen what these things are capable of . Your cowardice is noted , boy . But the valley would add a half-day to our trip , time we can 't spare . The forest it is . - CRISPIN : Move out ! - ( MOANS ) ( SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) Ugh ! ( MOANS ) CRISPIN : This is the last stop for water before we get to the fort . Whoa . - CRISPIN : Guards , spread out . - GUARD : Clear . CRISPIN : Check the perimeters . Keep your eyes open . ( ERETRIA WHIMPERS ) GUARD : Yes , sir . Cosy place . I 'm just saying , I think you were right about camping in the open . AMBERLE : Maybe we should stay here for the night . The Rover won 't make it much further . CRISPIN : The horses could use a break . Then we press on . But her shackles stay on . You shouldn 't let Crispin talk to you that way . He 's just trying to protect us . He knows the importance of this mission . Yeah , maybe . But the Ellcrys didn 't choose him for this quest . It chose you . Ever since we left the palace , you 've been treating me like your enemy . - The tree said that we need to work ... - I know what it said . I can 't imagine how hard this is for you , but you 're not alone . - Let me help you . - You can 't . ( BIRDS COO ) WIL : Alright , look - I know I lied to you about what happened between me and Eretria . I was embarrassed , that I let her take advantage . - ( SCOFFS ) - But it 's not gonna happen again . I 'm on your side . ( SHOUTING ) ( SHOUTING AND GRUNTING ) ( BLADE RINGS ) MAN : Weapons down ! ( MEN LAUGH ) Be honest . You missed me . ( LAUGHS ) ( HORSE WHINNIES ) Demons slaughtered the entire village . Everyone . They mutilated the children . They even gutted the dogs . Their tracks descend from the north , down through the Kensrowe . Must be gathering at the Breakline . Father . Father , are you listening ? Uh , the Breakline . Of course . These are just raiding parties . They 're testing our resolve . We must attack before they gather ... The Breakline is a mountain range 1,000 miles long . Even if we could find them , what then ? The Elvin army is the strongest in the Four Lands . A handful of Demons did this . What would a hundred do ? Or a thousand ? Which is exactly why we cannot wait for them to launch a full-scale attack . Our obligation is to the Ellcrys . We must secure the Sanctuary until Amberle 's return . We don 't even know if Amberle will return . This is not a debate ! Secure the palace . You will guard and protect the Ellcrys . That is an order . - Manx ! - ( GRUNTS ) He 's trying , brother . No , he is scared . And his fear is gonna get us all killed . ( PEOPLE CHATTER ) Here , drink this . You 'll be safe behind the palace walls . I could be wrong , but I think it 's a requirement that all soldiers be able to dress themselves . It goes ... like this . Thanks . Least I can do , you saving me from a Demon and all . I owe you my life . Well , I 'm just glad I didn 't freak you out again . Oh , you definitely freaked me out . Maybe you 'll tell me how you did it sometime . Maybe . How about tonight ? Uh ... ( CHUCKLES ) I 'll take that as a yes . I gotta go . I can see you 're enjoying your time in the palace . What are you doing here ? I 'm here to stop you from making a foolish mistake . You are no more a soldier than I am a diplomat . Demons slaughtered my family . Took everything that I ever loved . It 's my duty to fight . Your duty is to your gift . And I have need of it . BANDON : So you want me to talk to the tree . I want you to contact Amberle through the tree . The Ellcrys and the princess are connected , but I can no longer sense her presence . Maybe you can . I see death . I don 't ... - This is crazy . - ls it ? You have seen Catania 's future and Lorin 's past . You 've been able to stretch your mind across time and space . Nobody knows what you 're capable of . Not even you . But I believe your magic is powerful . OK . So , what do I do ? The Ellcrys is hundreds of thousands of years old . It has witnessed life and death on a scale impossible to fathom . Yet in order to confront its power , you must learn to control your own . How ? Practise . On you ? No way . I mean , what if I see ... The only thing you will see is possibilities , nothing more . ( GASPS ) - ( GROANS ) - ALLANON : Calm yourself , boy . Be the master of your own mind , not its prisoner . - Bandon ! - Uh ! BANDON : I did it . I was there . The moment you died , you felt my presence . - I was able to control it . - Good . Try again . What can I say , kiddo ? You delivered the goods . The Stones , the princess . She 'll fetch a hell of a price in Varfleet . - As long as I have my freedom . - Of course . Our camp 's not far . Come have a hot meal and collect your reward . You 've earned it . ( PATS CLOTHES ) Ohh ... - They 're of no use to you ! - Oh ? And why is that ? You 're not an Elf . I hate to break it to you , mongrel , but neither are you . ( CEPHELO LAUGHS ) If we don 't reach the fort by nightfall , they 'll send soldiers after us . And when they do ... You 'll be nothing but ragged flesh and bones . CRISPIN : Arggh ! ( GROANS AND GRUNTS ) This is marsh wolf country . Once they catch your scent , they 'll come running , and they will eat you alive while you watch . And once they 've had their fill of Elf , they 'll enjoy mongrel for dessert . Rovers ! Let 's go ! ( MAJESTIC MUSIC ) You said we were meeting with the generals . Father was right . Sending our army to the Breakline is foolish , but standing by while Demons slaughter our people ... - It makes us look weak . - What do you suggest ? That I lead a small unit to track the Demons to their source . Once I establish our enemy 's size , we can petition Father for more troops . No Elf has ever travelled beyond the Breakline 's outermost edges . Without an army , you won 't survive . True . No Elf has . Which is why I need a guide . The Gnome , Slanter . He was born inside the Breakline . - He knows its every peak and valley ... - ( GRUNTS ) That creature murdered our brother ! DIANA : Arion , listen to him . Our niece , Aine 's daughter , is out there , alone . Tell me you can sit still while she shoulders that burden . Tell me and ... and I 'll walk away . You plotted this behind my back ? You said you wanted to do something . This ? This is not what I meant . Arion ... ( GRUNTS ) ( HORSE WHINNIES ) ( ' HANDS DOWN' BY THE HOLY COAST PLAYS ) Eretria . Look , you 're right . You have no reason to trust me . But you were chosen just like me . We may not like it , but we 're in this together . Couldn 't be any less together . How much did he promise you ? Cephelo mentioned a reward . Gold , I 'm guessing . - What 's your point ? - This place is no palace . Whatever Cephelo 's offered you , my grandfather will pay 20 times that . CEPHELO : Ah . Just the lovely ladies I was looking for . I am almost gonna miss you . Am I free to go ? CEPHELO : I may be a bastard but I 'm a bastard who keeps his word . What , no hug ? That 's OK . ( SIGHS ) I 'm sure you 'll be much more accommodating . Never had Elf before . Is it true what they say ? - You 're a pig . - ( SNORTS ) ( SNIGGERS ) ( LAUGHS ) ( AMBERLE WHIMPERS ) We need to move . We 'll die out here in the open . We can 't go anywhere until we stop the bleeding . Your Rover girl 's gonna burn for this , boy . Great . I 'll be sure and tell her the next time we hang out . ( SCREAMS ) - ( GROANS ) - ( DISTANT HOWLING ) ELF : Where 's it coming from ? ( LAUGHTER AND CHATTER ) I want some more ! Ah , yeah ! I know a brothel owner that pays triple for Elves . - Got a little fight in ya . Good . - ( YELPS AND PANTS ) ( WHIMPERS ) Help ! - Please help me ! - ( LAUGHS ) Yell all you want , Princess . It 's nothing but music to me . Ohh ! ( GROANS ) - Thank you . - 20 times what Cephelo paid . - That 's what you said . - Of course . You have my word . Ugh ! You thieving little bitch ! You 're the one who taught me the value of a good double-cross . - Horses are outside . Let 's go . - You 're bringing him with us ? Unless you 'd like to do the honours . If he is with us , he 's not hunting us . Consider him insurance . CEPHELO : You think my men are gonna let you walk out of here ? You 're right . It 's a good thing I took care of them . ERETRIA : Nothing a little knockout powder can 't handle . CRISPIN : Stay in formation . Fill the gaps ! What is that ? What are you doing ? Bite down , big guy . - You 're gonna feel this . - ( PANTS ) ( GROANS ) ( GROANS AND PANTS ) - ( GROWLING ) - Oh ! ( WOLF GRUNTS ) I can see it . Oh ! - ( SCREAMS ) - ELF : Oh , no ! - ( SCREAMING ) - ( GROWLING ) - ( BLADE RINGS ) - ( WOLF WHIMPERS ) I leave you alone for a couple of hours and look what happens . You completely fall apart . ( BIRDS CHIRP ) Looking good . What do they feed you boys in the Vale ? Thought you 'd be happy to see me . Just ' cause you did the right thing once in your life doesn 't mean I trust you . You screwed me in the woods when I first met you and you screwed me at the castle , when I knew better . I 'm in no rush to let you do that again . Well , that 's too bad . You 're pretty good in bed . ( MAN SCREAMS ) - ( PUNCHING AND GRUNTING ) - AMBERLE : Enough ! - Enough ! - ( GRUNTING ) I said , " Enough ! " ( BLADE RINGS ) All due respect , Your Highness , but get out of my way . Now ! I understand you want justice , Captain , but not like this . - Keeping him alive is a mistake . - AMBERLE : Maybe . But if so , it will be my mistake . Now , stand down . ( SPITS ) - We 're not done , Rover . - Aye-aye , Captain . You hear that ? ( SILENCE ) I don 't hear anything . Exactly . No birds . - Scout . - Yes , sir . - Take a look up ahead . - Yes , sir . Anything we should know ? Scouting for tracks . According to the map , the fort is just beyond these woods . I don 't want any more nasty surprises . ( HORSE SNORTS ) ( WHINNIES ) ( GRUNTS ) Help ! Help ! Ah ! Help ! - We have to help him ! - Princess , that area is poisoned . - ERETRIA : We have to stay back . - Arggh ! CRISPIN : The wind is changing . We have to move . ( DOOR SLAMS ) ( GROWLS ) ( PANTS ) I come in peace , Gnome . SLANTER : I 've been locked up for 10 years . The only peace I will accept is your father 's head on a pike . I have something better . This is a key to your shackles . SLANTERI What is this ? Proposition . Your help , in exchange for your freedom . You must be desperate to come to me . The Elves are scared . We are . - And you should be too . - ( SCOFFS ) Dagda Mor has returned . Then we 're all undone . You 're sure about this ? ALLANON : There is no certainty with magic . But we are running out of time . Control your emotions . Sure . I felt your magic calling to me , young one . - What have you done to Amberle ? - You cannot save the girl . The Druid was a fool to send you . - ( GROWLS ) - ( GASPS ) ( WHIMPERS ) ( SCREAMS ) Bandon ! Bandon . CRISPIN : 3,000 years have passed , yet humankind 's weapons are still claiming lives . I lost a good man back there , Rover . CEPHELO : Oh , don 't worry about it , Captain . The Elves will get their chance to destroy the world . WIL : I hate to interrupt , but when the Demons show up , there won 't be any Elf this , human that . It 'll just be us and them . Look . We made it ! Where are the guards ? ( BLOWS HORN ) ( ALL GASP ) Let me guess . Rin Katsin . ( ROARS ) ( BELLOWS ) Fall back ! Scouts , engage ! Retreat to the woods and stay hidden . That thing will tear your men apart ! ( GROWLS ) - Princess , cut me loose . - CRISPIN : Don 't listen to him ! - Do not do it . - Come on ! Take the princess to the woods - Short Tips and I will distract that big bastard with the Stones . - Let 's go . - We will ? ( ROARS ) Fire those Stones up , kid . - They 're not working . - Time for plan B. - Which is ? - Run ! ( ROARS ) ( DEMON GROWLS ) Give me your dagger and your waterskin . - What ? Why ? - So I can stab you in the neck . Just give ' em to me ! I didn 't survive out here all these years without learning a few tricks . - Arggh ! - ( GROWLS ) CEPHELO : Take this . He 's going after Amberle . We need to draw it away . - ( BLADE RINGS ) - Ow ! What the hell ? ! Demons are drawn by blood . - I think . - You think ? - ( GROWLS ) - WIL : Now what ? Now we see how tough this bastard really is . Come on . ( ROARS ) Move fast . Stick to dry land . Breathe as little as possible . - ( ROARS ) - Let 's go . Get down ! ( DEMON ROARS ) ( LAUGHS ) Told you I had a plan . ( GRUNTS ) SLANTER : Having second thoughts , Prince ? - And third and fourth ones . - ( LAUGHS ) With good reason . The Breakline is no place for an Elf . It 's no place for anyone as long as Demons inhabit it . Diana . How did you know that I 'd be here ? 'Cause when someone tells you no , you tend to do the opposite . If you 're here to stop me , save your breath . I have to do this . What you 're doing is treason . - If you have a better idea , I 'm all points . - We do . - L 'm going with you . - The hell you are . The Chosen died on my watch . Won 't let these creatures take you as well . - You 're OK with this ? - No , not at all . But like you said , we have to do something . What about Father ? I 'll handle Father . ARION : You two just focus on getting back here alive . Don 't worry . We 'll be back before you know it . ( LAUGHS ) Let 's go . Move . DIANA : Keep walking . EVENTINE : Manx ? Manx ? Forgive the intrusion , Father . - I couldn 't sleep . - Oh , me neither . I can 't find Manx . I 'm worried about him . We are at war , and you 're worried about a hound . Well , he is loyal to me . What 's the matter , boy ? What 's wrong ? I have failed you , Father . I 've let you down . And I don 't know how . But this rift between us , I ... I can 't bear it . Oh . Look . You have not let me down . The world has let me down . I need you by my side now more than ever . But not on the throne . No , not until my work is done . - ( BLADE SLASHES ) - ( GASPS ) Well , if you will not give me the throne , then I 'll just have to take it . - ( SQUELCH ) - om ( GROANS ) ( THUD ) Long live the King .

 Previously on " Hunters " ... Why did McCarthy single out the new agent ? He has the scar . Losing you was the worst thing that ever happened to me . I know what you are . I 'm still the same person . You 're not a person . You 're launching a nuclear attack on us . We 're not planning an attack . We 're trying to leave earth . I 'll tell you where the launch is . I get immunity . This is a kill mission . All Hunters are to be shot on sight . got here as fast as we could . I don 't understand . There are traitors everywhere . Regan is inside . Agent Regan can 't be trusted . not yours . You are no longer in command here . How 'd you know ? I suspected Finnerman when the bomb went off . I knew for certain the minute she sent me here . Briggs betrayed me .

Are you all right ? at least . We have McCarthy . McCarthy ? He came to us . but only if he gets immunity . Do you believe him ? I don 't think we have a choice . He says the launch is in 48 hours . bring him in . - To ETU ? - What about Finnerman ? - Don 't worry about Finnerman . She tried to have me killed . Flynn went AWOL with me . I 'll explain ... - What ? No ! I 'll explain later when you get here . What 's wrong ? Are you all right ? It 's been a long night . Just bring McCarthy in . We need to stop this launch . Mankind dreams of leaving their home planet . They build machines to take them . They know not how these ambitions will end . How many Hunters have arrived ? Lots of families . Children .

We will treat him with respect . I 'm sorry about what happened in the hotel . I tried to stop it . So you squared it with Finnerman ? There is something you ought to see . No shit . It wasn 't us . I know . Hunters got to her . Local P.D. found the body dumped a few miles from here an hour ago . tissue extraction . It 's a warning . They can get to any of us any time . She deserved it . get negotiations started . sir . Gladly . Nobody deserves this . She wanted to genocide an entire species . You gonna defend her now ? You disobeyed a direct order when you helped that Hunter family escape . They were innocent . There are gonna have to be some changes around here if I 'm gonna let you back on the team . You don 't get preferential treatment anymore . Preferential treatment ? Are you serious ? Briggs treats me like a leper and Flynn only likes me because I saved his life . I mean from me . Regan . I can no longer consider you one of us . you mean . Do we understand one another ? sir . Here 's the deal . we need answers and we need them now . We 're offering protective custody . A security detail . but you 'll be comfortable . Hunters have our own ways of making a pact . and a gyroscope . old boy . man ! Seriously ? After everything we 've been through together ? I trust you . Then tell me where the launch location is . I 'm not just gonna tell you where it is . where 's the fun in that ? I knew it . I know you 're playing games with us . I 'll take you to it . Field trip . All right . I 'll kill you myself . old tricks . You don 't have it in you anymore . Don 't make me prove it . call-mining for clicks . They can 't hide an entire launch site . Then we search quadrant by quadrant until we find them . Guano . or you will end up like Finnerman . Finnerman ? You haven 't heard ? Hunters bagged your cougar . Body 's in the lab . Where 's this supposed spaceship supposedly going ? of course . Where the Hunter colony ship lies in high orbit . The colony 's ship will take everyone back to the Hunter home planet and so ends Hunter-human relations . of course . you got yourself a deal . There 's just one small detail . Conventional human technology is too slow and inefficient so the ship that Musa built ... it 's like your project Orion . Go on . Papa will explain . Jackson ! I need to call the Defense Secretary and warn him now . Jackson ! What 's going on ? Project Orion was a spaceflight program from the 1950s . The technology called for an ... The technology called for nuclear energy to be used to launch a space ship . Like nuclear subs ? No . A nuclear explosion launches the ship . one right after the other . The fallout ... Will cover an area far greater than the airspace cleared by Bob Brecke . It will cover the entire continent . What are you doing ? I 'm pulling you out of school . - You 're not serious . - I am . Close the door . You 're gonna stay with your Aunt Josie in Canada . What ? No ! She 's like 19 and she lives in the North Pole . She 's 26 . She lives in Saskatchewan and it 's just for a few days . Maybe longer . I 'm not going . What is this all about ? It 's too dangerous to stay here anymore . - I need you far away . - From what ? Is it those scary guys at your work ? I didn 't tell anyone about Abby . I know . And that 's not what this is about . you 're leaving . This is not up for debate . Then you 're gonna have to drag me out . Abby 's gone . too . Emme ... I can 't do this anymore . I can 't pretend to be your dad anymore . You 're better off with a real family . But I love you . too . We are less than 36 hours away from a nuclear disaster . we have confirmation on the intel . Our informant says the launch site is in northern Mexico . A Hunter sleeper agent disabled satellite response for that region . we 're deploying immediately . we will . What is it ? McCarthy 's playing you . I know that . so we 're playing along . Even if he 's leading us into a trap ? You have a problem following my orders ? Dr. James thinks that Finnerman might have already been dead when the Hunters took a tissue sample . All the other victims were still alive during the extraction . So it 's a pity that we can 't ask Finnerman what really happened . You had me call her to the farmhouse and now she 's dead . Ruth made a lot of enemies . But only one took her out . We 're moving out in 30 . Be ready . Dismissed . So why are you ratting out on Musa now ? He 's leaving . It 's now or never . Then why bother ? you know ? Killed and terrorized while he Elon Musk 'd it and played philosopher king . Revenge . How primitive . Yes . We understand each other . Not even close . but we do . Musa abandoned me . Liana abandoned you . Musa abandoned your father . Circle of strife . Come on . You 're Simba and Mommy is big bad Scar . Hakuna fu ... matata ! Ooh . kitten . Grr . Feisty . Why don 't you just go back to your home planet and save us all a lot of grief ? I kinda like it here . Agent Alison Regan . look who 's here . Ha ! It 's the same with Abby . your sham of a marriage . But she kept making excuses to stay . Star-crossed lovers . Literally . All she really wants is to be with you . Liana . All our hard work finally coming to fruition . But I 'm worried about you . Your health . but you still look unwell . Do you need another injection ? Perhaps I look unwell because I feel under threat . Am I under threat ? The humans have proved more resilient than we thought . No threats from within ? Brother Number Four . And you ? Who are you devoted to ? My own kind . Musa ? Liana ? Get away from him ! no ! He is no danger ! Liana is trying to kill me . What ? that isn 't true . She 's been taking care of you . too . But look at my body . It is getting worse . The medicine she gave me . Poison . that can 't be . Brother . She murdered one of my loyal feelers . Why would she do that ? She is Exalted . We must stop her . all that talk about innocence . A whole lot of nothing . Bullshit . everything okay with you and Regan ? That 's none of your business . She was pretty rattled that Finnerman turned on her . Can 't blame her . Quite the betrayal . We 've all had our share . Abby was telling the truth about the Purge . Apparently . But she didn 't say shit about the launch frying millions of humans . McCarthy said the only Hunters who knew were Musa and Liana . Inner circle . McCarthy 's not exactly forthcoming . doesn 't change the mission . So you are prepared to stop her if it comes to that . I wouldn 't be sitting here if I wasn 't sir . You get Emme to someplace safe ? Safe enough . You look excited . To see your mom again . Thrilled . Your mom 's strong . Decisive . You should look up to her . Young women need positive role models . My mom is weak . Musa 's pawn . That 's where you 're wrong . Everything Liana 's done has been for the good of her kind . Of our kind . and you never will be . you already knew that . or I 'm putting your gag on . We 're here . He 's screwing with us . Give him a minute . We don 't have a minute . That way . check it out . Safe for now . Hunters only fly at night . Regan . Put the restraints back on it . Restraints ? I gotta do restraints ? we should take him out for good . we should take him out . I heard that . Bat-eared freak . Not very nice . I made a deal . I 'll keep up mine . He 's a risk . the more we 're all in danger . The decision 's been made . shit . what do you see ? get back here . Roger that . And you doubted me . ye of little faith . Elder Jackson . Why did you come to me with this information ? Why me ? the ugly . I 've seen ' em all . The difference between your kind and ours is that humans aspire to something beyond primal hungers . you 're the humanest human I 've ever met . No . I am hardly perfect . Of course not . just like I am . Truss . we save mankind . Or at least a few million Mexicans . Thank you . De nada . We may need more intel . Keep Mr. McCarthy in the vehicle until after the raid is over . Ponyboy . Ground to control . Cargo is currently being loaded . ground . Pre-flight alignment complete . Launch window has been determined . 14 hours and counting . control . 14 hours and counting . listen up .

Potassium iodide . This will give you some protection from the radiation . we won 't need it . ethnic sidekick with an attitude . You got a snappy comment or you here just to look cute ? You think you 're so smart ? You know what I call you ? Takeout . You 're not going anywhere . I got what I wanted . Musa and his followers captured by the humans and me into the wind before you fools even ... Regan . The evacuation is underway . Where are we with the breach ? We 're approaching the hangars . There 's guards posted at the perimeter . McCarthy 's down . Down ? Down how ? Sonic blast . Briggs was the last one with him . It had to be done . You disobeyed a direct order . The order was bullshit . putting these freaks down like the monsters they are . I 'm happy to handle it . You 're way out of line . I know what you did to Finnerman . You want me to keep my mouth shut . I make my own decisions . You can 't prove who killed Finnerman . I don 't have to . I 'll bury you first . sir . McCarthy was shot on my command . Clean it up . Agent . Commander . Auto launch sequence initiated . T-minus 15 minutes to fuel cell ignition . Hello ? Everyone 's boarded the ship . What are you doing out here ? dividing up the search . Hold up .

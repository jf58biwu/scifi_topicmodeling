 Previously on " Agent Carter " ... The Arena Club ? What the hell have you gotten yourself into , Peg ? I don 't know . But at least I know where to start looking . I want to plant listening devices in the club and let them incriminate themselves . You and Peggy make a great team . I 'm happy to help out Miss Carter in any way I can . Look . Peggy ... No , don 't touch me . I 've seen this before . This is a side effect of zero matter . Mr. Stark 's process would make all invisible wavelengths visible . Dr. Wilkes . Why can 't I touch him ? He 's visible . He 's just not tangible . Am I dead ? We thought so , but apparently not . Meet Agnes Cully . " Whitney Frost " is her stage name . America 's sweetheart is the brains behind Isodyne Energy . Oh , my God ! I will slay you , dragon , and save the princess . Now , fair maiden , I will cut off the dragon 's head . - Give it back . - Here it is . Come on . Take it . Michael , give it to me . Margaret Elizabeth Carter ! You 'll be the death of me , Peggy Carter . Where is my blasted handkerchief ? Oh , go on . Have a laugh . But one of these days , You 're going to have to start behaving like a lady . Four ... Oh , sorry . I 'm starved . I miss food . Oh , yes . I hadn 't thought of that . - Are you hungry ? - No . Well , I don 't think so . I don 't have any sense of my body at all , actually . I 'm numb . It 's disconcerting . I wish I could be of more use in helping you find a way to reverse your condition . Well , if spending time with you is the byproduct of my current state , I 'd almost say it 's worth it . Still , it must be very ... Frustrating . You have no idea . You were saying ? Right . What we 're looking at is a design for a fast-neutron reactor . They built one like it in Los Alamos last year , which at full power could generate 25 kilowatts . Oh . Right . Three years before that , Agnes Cully ... or , as we know her , Whitney Frost ... patented this reactor that can theoretically generate a thousand times more power . So she 's a genius . I 'm a genius . Whitney Frost ... she defies categorization . It 's open . Miss Frost ? A package has just arrived for you . Where would you like it ? In here , Mabel . Beside the vanity is fine . Thank you . That 'll be all . Something 's moving in here . Thank you . That 'll be all . Well ... Mr. Chadwick is inside , but no sign of Miss Frost . Not a dead loss , though . I did get you a button . Thank you . For the purposes of blending in , Miss Carter . Whitney Frost isn 't here . She certainly isn 't at work . No one 's seen her since her director disappeared . Well , perhaps she 's still at her home . " Holed up , " as they say . She and her husband have gone to great lengths to hide her involvement in zero matter . Perhaps exposing her is the key to exposing everything . Ah . Here 's Mr. Chadwick now . Oh , Hedy Lamarr is divorcing husband number three . Be still my beating heart . Mr. Jarvis , look at that driver 's hand . Oh . What a coincidence . It 's got the same wound you inflicted on that attacker the other day . The Chadwicks appear to have built quite a formidable wall around themselves . Well , it 's high time we put a crack in that wall . Got it . Thank you , Rose . You are a wonder . The car is registered to Rufus Hunt . Served in the Philippines during the war . Court-martialed , dishonorably discharged for black market profiteering . Well , that 's a career that easily transitions to assassin , I would imagine . He is currently Head of Security at the Arena Social Club , which means he quite likely has access to all manner of secrets . Well , given our previous encounter , I 'm not sure we can be certain to divulge anything . He nearly bested the both of us . Mm , we 'll have to be creative . Subdue him somehow without getting our own necks wrung in the process . I may have just the thing . I trust you 've operated a tranquilizer rifle before . I can 't say that I have . Why on earth have you ? On occasion , wrangling Mr. Stark 's animal preserve requires a ruthless hand . Not the flamingo . The koala . Its adorable appearance belies a vile temperament . What are you feelings on committing a felony , Mr. Jarvis ? In this case ... Decidedly for . _ Look at this mess , Aggie . Uncle Bud 's coming by any minute now . Mama , you 've been complaining about the broken radio for weeks . Get cleaned up , Baby . You remember ... be sweet to Uncle Bud . He 's not my uncle . He 's good to us . Weren 't for him , we ... Well , you 're lucky you have a Mama takes care of you . Hello , darlin ' . Oh , Sugar . I 'll be damned if you don 't feel as firm as you look . Aww , Sugar , I 've been looking forward to seeing you all day . What are you working on over there ? - Oh . - Playing with the radio ? Whoop ! You 're not careful , your face will stick like that , girl . Can I have my pencil back , please ? I bet you 're real pretty when you smile . Come on . Why don 't you smile for your Uncle Bud ? Because I 'm thinking . Got a real strange kid here , Wilma . Yes . Well , why don 't you go on upstairs and get comfy , Sugar ? - I 'll be right up . - Mm . All right ? I told you to be sweet . I don 't like him , Mama . You hush up . You stay out of my hair for the next couple hours . Clean up this mess . - Just a minute . - Whitney , are you in there ? Yes . - What are you doing in here ? - I 'm just running lines . I have a busy day . Assuming they find your director . Paper said he hadn 't been heard from since Tuesday . Well , Kenneth likes to drink . I wouldn 't be surprised if they found him floating in a reservoir . Hush . Don 't say that . That 'd be terrible for the campaign . Did you want something ? Oh , the photographer called . He asked if you could wear the white dress tonight . You know , the one with the ... - The neckline . - The neckline . That was the one I was going to pick . It 's not every day that Life magazine wants to put you on the cover . We play our cards right , and you will be the most beautiful First Lady this country 's ever seen . Mm , Darling ... No one deserves it more than you . That 's my beautiful girl . - We 'll see you at 6 : 00 ? - Mm-hmm . Don 't be late . No . Open up ! This is the police ! We know you 're in there , Hunt ! Come out right now with your hands up ! Ma 'am , please go back to your domicile and shut the door ! And shut the door . Thank you . That 's it , Hunt ! Time 's up ! I 'm gonna come in and start squirting lead ! Remember me , Mr. Hunt ? Oh , for heaven 's sake . That 's enough to take down a rhinoceros . Easy as pie . Mr. Jarvis , are you all right ? Jarvelous ! This is not my lucky day . Ah . Chief Sousa , what brings you here ? - Thompson called . - Mm-hmm . He approved your vacation days , but he 's not very happy about it . Thank you so much for coming to deliver the message . - I know you 're very busy . - That 's not all . I dug a little deeper , got some stats on Whitney Frost . Wonderful . Very good . - I will dive right into them ... - Agnes Cully got discovered in front of the Olympic Movie House in ' 34 . They gave her a flashy new name , put her in the pictures . She became Anvil Studios' top earner by ' 38 . Fascinating . Is that in the file ? I will read it directly . - You okay ? - Of course . Because I know when somebody 's trying to brush me off . Brushed ? You ? What happened to him ? An overindulgence of drink . We ... Caught a possum on this property earlier this morning . Vicious little creature . Hunt : Let me out of here ! Or I have a man stashed in the boot . Hey ! Let me out of here ! It 's a felony ! - A felony ? That 's harsh . - I can 't even believe it ! What were you thinking ? ! I was doing the best I could in our opportunity . I thought we were a team . - We are a team ... a wonderful team . - No , we 're not a team . If we were a team and you were thinking about pulling a stunt like this , - you would 've called me for backup . - I did have backup . Mr. Jarvis was with me . Oh , Mommy , it 's the biggest horsy ever . He 's also part of the team . Peggy , you kidnapped somebody . I had to give you some plausible deniability . You 've already faced enough blowback from the SSR on my account . I 've already ruined your proposal . If I can contain the mess in the rest of your life , the better I 'll sleep . Well , I 'll sleep better if you stop pushing me away and let me help you . So , what do you got planned for Rufus Hunt ? I was thinking I 'd kill him . Look , Hunt , you 're not our priority . Obviously . Tell me about the work you do for Calvin Chadwick and his buddies at the Arena Social Club . Oh . Is that all ? I need names of members , I need to know what they 're up to , and I want to know how Whitney Frost figures into all this . Club policy says I ain 't allowed to socialize with the members or their wives . You really want to do this the hard way ? Did you get that leg in combat ? Bastogne . Europe . Cute . Look , you gonna smack me around or break a couple fingers ? Have at it . Because while you were playing grab-ass on the continent , I was already playing this game with the Japanese . And they took these fingers and tied them to a jeep and dragged me around in circles ... Once before breakfast , once before lunch . And there wasn 't no lunch . You 're gonna get out of me the same thing they got , which is squat . He 's all yours . We 're not going to torture you . Of course you 're not . I know all about you , running around , pretending you 're Eliot Ness . See , and that 's your problem , really . People on your side have a line you just can 't cross . I meant to say we 're not going to torture you because ... we don 't have time . We thought you 'd run out of time , love . We started taking wagers around the office that Fred would never pop the question . I bet he would . Someone owes me 2 quid . It might be me . I bet he wouldn 't . All right , ladies , enough chatting . Back to your codes . Miss Carter , a word . Of course , Mr. Edwards . I hear congratulations are in order . Yes . I 'm to be married . Lovely . Well , I hope you are ready for another proposal . What 's S.O.E. ? Special Operations Executive . It 's a new war division spearheaded by Winston Churchill himself . - And they need a codebreaker ? - Codebreaker ? Good heavens , no . They 're being tasked to train field agents in irregular warfare ... Espionage , sabotage , guerrilla tactics . Field work ? But they don 't send women into the field . Resistance networks all over Europe need people who won 't draw attention walking down the street . They need women . And they 're recruiting you . Why ? That is ... Why me ? Well , you 're already an exceptional codebreaker , Miss Carter . Someone must see a great deal of potential in you . It 's quite an honor to be tapped . Yes ... I see . I 'm sorry , Mr. Edwards . I don 't believe I 'm meant to be in the field . This is a rare chance for you to strike a massive blow for King and Country . Yes , sir . I will discuss it with my fiancé . But I 'm ... I 'm afraid I 'm simply not cut out for that kind of work . I was in the war , as well . And it taught me that people on my side sometimes need to blur the line to stop people on your side . I 've done my homework on you , Mr. Hunt . I know you served in the Pacific that means you 'll recognize the effects of malaria . Malaria ? A particularly virulent strain , developed from an avian parasite by Stark Industries . There is an antidote , but if your refuse to talk , why should I give it to you ? I 'm sure you 'll need some time to mull over our proposal . The toxin 's effects become fatal in 20 minutes . I 'll be back in 10 . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , get back in here ! Hey ! That 's one way to do it . Well , let 's hope it works . What did you stick him with ? Howard wanted to create a cure for the common cold . He came up with a compound that brings on intense symptoms in minutes . You gave him a cold ? An intense cold . H-e-e-ey ! Cup of tea ? This is crazy . I had to hear it from Lorraine down the street that you 've been stepping out with the Owens girl ! - She 's hardly a year older than Agnes . - I didn 't plan it to happen . Don 't get mad , Sugar . You you 're breaking my heart . What heart , you lousy cheat ? ! You got to understand , Wilma . Understand what ? Wanted something young and pretty to climb on top of ? She 's a woman . - She 's good to me . - Wasn 't I good to you , Bud ? D ... didn 't we take care of one another ? I want you out of here by tomorrow . You go to hell , Bud Schultz ! You go straight to hell ! You could 've been nicer to him . I didn 't like him . You think you 're so damn smart . You really think that that fancy science program is gonna take a girl ? It don 't matter how smart you are . You 're stuck here , same as me . I will still get out of here ... away from you . Come here ! Mama ! No one cares what 's in your head . If you were half as smart as you think you are , you 'd fix on this . This is the only thing that 's gonna get you anywhere in this world . Hello ? Whitney , you 're an hour late . I 'm sorry , darling . I 'm I 'm not feeling well . Well , can 't you just pull yourself together for an hour or so ? What happened to " the show must go on " ? I 'm afraid I won 't be able to make it . Whitney , this is Life Magazine . They 're gonna cancel the cover story if you 're not involved . I just know it . It 's your face they want , not ... One name , Hunt . Let 's just start with one name . Please . You 're impressive . At death 's door . All you need to do to live is to answer a few questions , and yet here you sit , silent . I can 't tell if you 're motivated by strong convictions or spite . Peg ... Want to pump the brakes on him a little bit ? He 's got five minutes left . That 's a generous estimation . He 's no use to us dead . He 's no use to us alive and quiet . Thomas Gloucester ! The Wall Street guy . Hugh Jones . Roxxon . I 've had the pleasure . Give me the antidote ... now . Not until we finish our conversation . - Then you 'll be clear and free to do as ... - Free ? I 'll never be free again , not after this . This stuff 's gonna buy me a couple of days . You can get out of town , run . Or the SSR can protect you . Are you two really that dumb ? Huh ? There 's no running , no protection . You think the men I work for are just criminals , like a ... like a stickup man ? ! They 're in everything ! And what they can 't buy , they destroy . President McKinley , Black Tuesday ... You think those things just happened ? Run ? I 'm already dead . And so are you . Do you want those extra days or not ? W ... wait . Storage room ... at the club . The Council of Nine . That 's what they 're called . They record their meetings . You 'll see ... everything you want to know about Calvin Chadwick and the rest of his crowd . It 's on those tapes . Times " N " to the power of " P. " Is that correct , Dr. Wilkes ? It is , Mr. Jarvis . - Thank you . - Wonderful . What does it mean ? It means I 'm back at square one . My theory has been that my atoms have lost cohesion at a quantum level , but ... I think I 've reached a dead end . Look , why don 't we step away from the task for a moment ? We 've been working for hours . Dr. Wilkes ? Dr. Wilkes , are you quite well ? I 'm fine . Uh , just got lost in my head a little . - Jarvis , where 's the phone ? - It 's on the desk . I take it Mr. Hunt fell for our little ruse . - He certainly did . - I got a buddy at the U.S. Attorney 's office . He 'll get the judge to get the warrant . A warrant ? For what ? We 're raiding the Arena Club . The minute we get the warrant , we 'll mobilize . When we get to the Arena Club , we 'll split into two teams . Team one will cover the offices , gathering information . I want accounting information , membership rosters , stuff like that . Team two will go with Agent Carter through the hidden door into the secret area of the club . That 's right . He did say " hidden door " and " secret area . " We 're dealing with odd rich men here . They love this sort of thing . Sousa . What ? - What ? - What is it ? You Chief Sousa ? Yeah . Who wants to know ? The man who signs your timecards . Vernon Masters , War Department . What can I do for you ? Well , let 's start by putting these shotguns away . They 're making this situation a bit more tense than it needs to be . Sir , we 're about to conduct a raid on the Arena l ... Let 's put that on the back burner . The War Department has decided to audit this branch 's cases , past and present . This is outrageous . Peggy ... It 's an executive order . Comes straight from D.C. So , if you 'll just crack open your files , we 'll get to work , and I 'm sure this will all be done in no time . Chief , would you mind showing my men around ? Guys . After you . And you ... must be the Agent Carter that I keep hearing so much about . Have I been dying to talk to you . We have credible information implicating members of the Arena Club in a conspiracy that involves numerous murders and experimental work in a highly dangerous substance . There is no legitimate reason to prevent the SSR enforcing the law , even on those who believe they are above it . How are you enjoying your vacation , Agent Carter ? Vigorously . Jack Thompson thinks very highly of you . He says that you 're quite the independent thinker . I 'm sure he meant that as an insult . Perhaps . Times like these , it 's often safer to be seen as a team player . But you ... don 't seem like the type of lady who plays anything safe . That 's a compliment , by the way . Allowing these men to escape scrutiny is the very definition of playing it safe . According to our source , their influence reaches well beyond the Isodyne cover-up . Mm . How so ? Assassinations , market manipulation ... We won 't know the full extent of the council 's power until we pry open their secrets . Who is this source ? We 're keeping his name confidential for his own safety . Bring him in . I 'd like to vet him personally . Chief Sousa and I signed an affidavit , vouching for his credibility as a C.I. That 's more than sufficient for a warrant . Not this time . Who is he ? You 're refusing to reveal his identity ? Call it independent thinking . You know , the Hollywood Ten thought they were independent thinkers , too . A communist witch hunt has no relevance to the work of the SSR . But it should be relevant to you ... A spy who isn 't even American . A tidal wave is coming , Agent Carter . And you are going to have to work very hard to stay afloat . I 'll manage . Maybe so . But your friends could still drown . _ A toast , to my two favorite men , meeting at last . Cheers . Come on , Peggy . Slug it back . You won 't beat your older brother this time . I 've been practicing . Michael , not here . You can do that ? N ... not recently . So , Michael , tell me how goes it at the front ? Well , there are lots of Nazis there , and they tend to shoot at you a great deal . Apart from that , the scenery is splendid . Do let me know if there 's anything you feel the Home Office isn 't providing . I have a direct line to command . Consider me your personal concierge . That 's very kind of you , Fred . Did I tell you I was recruited to be a spy ? We turned them down , of course . Did we ? Can you imagine ? Risking life and limb behind enemy lines , doing God knows what there . That 's not our Peg . One thing I 've learned from the war ... A boring life is a privilege . I 'll get us a top-up , hmm ? So ? What do you think ? Well , it doesn 't matter what I think . You 're the one marrying him . Of course it matters . I want you to like him . Why did you turn down the S.O.E. job ? It 's just ... Wasn 't the plan that we had for our lives . How do you know it was S.O.E. ? 'Cause I recommended you . Michael ... You should 've told me . Look , Peggy , I know you better than anyone else alive . And ... this isn 't what you want . What is it that you think I want ? The same thing you 've wanted since you were a little girl ... A life of adventure . Well , I 've grown up . My dreams changed . No , you 've just let everyone else drum them out of you . Fred 's a nice enough chap , but be honest ... Is he the love of your life ? Is this really how you see your future ? This is my engagement party , Michael . Not your wedding day . Look , there is still time to change your mind . I don 't have to listen to this . Don 't worry what other people think . You are meant to fight . Stop pretending to be someone that you 're not . Peg ... Peggy , come back . Peggy , Peggy . Wait . I didn 't account for the central district judge being in the council 's pocket . I 'm sorry . Don 't apologize for believing people have ethics and morals . The Arena Club 's removed any incriminating evidence by now . Our only chance at infiltrating that place is locked in a broom closet . I doubt we can poison him again . What 's the next step ? Your next step is to stay here and save your hide . Why ? 'Cause a tidal wave is coming , and all my friends are gonna be branded commies ? Yeah , I got that speech , too . I 'm in this with you till the end , Peggy . It 's only gonna get more difficult , Daniel . They 've taken all the evidence from the SSR . Not all of it . Tissue sample from Jane Scott 's autopsy . I convinced Dr. Samberly to misplace it . - Told him I 'd put in a good word for him with Rose . - You are brilliant . Let 's pay another visit to our guest in the broom closet . On your feet . Move ! We can talk this out , huh ? Like a couple of soldiers . Talking is done . Council 's on to us . We can 't risk you returning to the fold and opening your trap about what we know . Look , if you 're gonna shoot me , you might as well go ahead and do it right here , 'cause I 'm done marching . Have it your way . Well , that went well . Yeah . I still don 't know why I had to take a punch . It 's the least you could contribute . He 's already throttled me twice . I need a drink . What happened , Mr. Hunt ? I ain 't talking to you . Where 's Chadwick ? Cal 's at a fund raising dinner . He could be begging all night . Good . He won 't mind if I help myself . What happened ? I ain 't saying a word till your husband gets home . I said I need a drink . This could take a while . A drink sounds pretty good right about now . I 'll bring the bottle . _ Mum , we can 't have you weeping all through the ceremony . Can I help crying when I 'm happy ? Where is my blasted handkerchief ? Oh , dear . Let 's get this dress off before I stain it . Oh , I 'll go and see who that is . Stewart , what is it ? M ... Michael ! You call this the good stuff ? I 'm sorry if our liquor cabinet fails to live up to your standards , Mr. Hunt . Jason , is everything all right ? Goes down like ... Sorry . I didn 't mean to startle you . It 's okay . I 'm just ... having trouble concentrating . What is it ? Are you unwell ? Have you ever been so bone tired ... that no matter what you did ... you simply cannot keep your eyes open ? Jason , I know you say you can 't sleep , but please try . It 's more than that . I can 't describe it . It 's as if ... Something is ... is calling me ... Pulling me away . Pulling you away ? To where ? I don 't know . But it would be really easy to just ... Let go . My brother used to say to me that I was meant to fight . I believe you 're cut from the same cloth , Jason . We will fix this , I promise you . But you can 't let go . You must hold on . Calvin , is that you ? Oh , thank God . Oh . Rufus . You 've been missing in action all day . - Chadwick 's arrived home . - What the hell happened to you ? You look like you 've gone 10 rounds with a meat grinder . Yeah , that SSR agent , the one you had me go after , Peggy Carter ? She kidnapped me . Kidnapped ? Yeah , she shot me with a tranquilizer gun , locked me in her trunk . She tried to kill me . She 's finished . I 'll have her job for this . I will have her deported . - Who the hell does she think she is ... - What did you tell her ? What ? I didn 't ... What did you tell her ? All right , look . She ... she injected me with something . I thought I was dying , all right ? What did you say ? She wanted names . And you gave them to her ? We hired you because you said you couldn 't be broken . And this is what you have to show for it ? No . I 'm not taking the fall for this . You 're gonna have to answer to the Council yourself . See , I think that 's where you 're wrong . No . You 're gonna protect me . 'Cause I can go to the council , too , and tell them what you 're up to and what your wife 's up to . So you 're gonna help me , or I 'm gonna get real yappy real fast . You son of a bitch . Sweetheart ... I have to show you something . Whitney , I 'm in the middle of something here . - You know , just get out of here . - I know , but this is important . Mr. Hunt made a mistake . And we all make mistakes . And mistakes can be fixed . Whitney ... What are you doing ? Whitney , w ... what is this ? ! Whitney ! Whitney , stop ! Stop ! We lost the signal . What on earth did she do ? I don 't know . _ Paper ! Get your paper ! Didn 't I see you here last week ? We didn 't change the movie . What 's the point in seeing it again ? It 's a nice escape from the world . Helps you forget about your troubles . Hey . Just this once . You know , I bet you 're real pretty when you smile . Yeah , that 's what I 'm talking about . Ned Silver , talent agent to the stars . A smile like that , I bet I could get you some work as a model . Or maybe ... even an actress in one of those pictures . What do you think ? That sounds real interesting . Fantastic . What 's your name ? Agnes . Agnes Cully . Well , that 'll have to change . Why ? 'Cause you need a name as pretty as you are . That 's the beauty of Hollywood . You can be whatever you want . What happened , Whitney ? What happened ? What was that ? That was me ... Fixing another one of your problems . What are you ? Whatever I want .

 ( GRUNTS ) LUCY : Previously on Killjoys ... You 've been cleared for Level Four . Just as soon as you pass your psych eval . Go see Pawter . PAWTER : You need a RAG-certified doctor . I 'm the only one around for miles . You 're passing me . Well , all right . The Jaqobis brothers together as Killjoys . Asking D 'avin to join our team , without asking me first ? DUTCH : He 's your brother . I thought you 'd be happy . He 'll probably just leave again once he finds that doctor he 's tracking . VENDOR : Hey ! Stop him ! ( GRUNTS ) JOHN : Tell me that you got him . Next time you tell me to go east , don 't mean west . JOHN : He didn 't get him . ( GRUNTS ) Fine . Plan B. D 'AVIN : What 's Plan B ? The plan where Dutch and I take over because you didn 't listen to my directions , Rookie . No way . It 's my first collar . My call . My balls . One , please . Thank you . Whoops . So , if I touch him first , this could still count as my first catch , right ? Maybe . Say pretty please . Touch this . ( GRUNTS ) Bye , hop-bag . I do not like him . Then , get him . Hey ! Hey ! ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Hey ! Enzo ! Do you mind ? Sorry . Smells delicious . D 'AVIN : Lost him . John , you got a bead on him ? JOHN : Go west - Your west , or a normal person 's west ? Funny . I miss just shooting people . They 're so much easier to catch when they 're dead . You 're not a soldier anymore , remember ? You 're a Killjoy . First official warrant , D 'avin . How do you think a miss will look to the RAC ? Fail . The answer is fail . There . Hey . Welcome to Plan C , bitch . No . No , I can 't do another set in West Hole . Oh , I hear you , man . But you kind of , uh , ( CLICKS TONGUE ) how do I say this , chopped up your foreman . People frown at that . Nowhere else to go . Except up . So long , shit-stacks . Oh , don 't do that . D 'AVIN : Screw it , I 'm taking him out . DUTCH : Stop ! That 's a security wire . Move back . D 'AVIN : Why ? What 's it do ? ( GROANING ) That . Um ... Level Four warrants are " live or dead , " right ? Yeah . Yeah . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) Dead , it is . Bellus again . What 's up her skirt today ? We 're bringing him in . Someone get a shovel . You tagged him , you bag him . ( MIMICKING JOHN ) You tag him , you bag him . LUCY : We are now 205 minutes behind schedule . DUTCH AND D 'AVIN : Shut up , Lucy . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Finally , she shows up . What 's with all the calls today ? We got the mark . Like we always do . Took some doing . Yeah , we 're still smoothing out the kinks of working together . Smooth faster . You 've been requested for a warrant . Bellus , I 'm still wearing my last warrant . This one comes direct from the Nine . So , I 'm expected to volunteer ? I 'd say you 're being volun-told . Volun-told to do what ? Nothing . We pass . Enzo Galang . As promised . Congratulations . You 're getting Enzo all over my desk . Dutch , with me . I 'm not changing my mind . The Nine are a bunch of inbred fascist nobles who think that just because they run the Company , they run the Quad . Don 't they ? Why are you using the good tea ? And whose perfume am I smelling ? Forgive me . I may have sprayed it on a bit thick . My sense of smell 's a tad inbred . BELLUS : May I present Delle Seyah Kendry of the Nine . You couldn 't warn me ? And miss all this ? This broker assures me you are the best female Killjoy . lam the best . Period . I certainly hope so . Come . I require your assistance . To do what ? Prevent a war . Come , come , come uninvited Run , run , run till I find you I don 't care which side that you 're fighting Gonna get you gone I need you to transport a young woman to Qresh . Provided you can keep your lovers in check . Pardon ? DELLE SEYAH : This girl rarely encounters men . It 's critical she 's kept unmolested . I think my lovers can handle that . GUARD : All clear . Leave us . What I 'm about to tell you is confidential . Two days ago , one of our nine clans , the Lahanis , unexpectedly lost the last of their line . As luck would have it , the family is survived by one last hope . An heir , implanted in a pristine surrogate . A Leithian Vessel . I 've heard of this practice . So , are you Nine infertile ? No more or less than any others . But we of the Nine find birth gauche . An unnecessary risk for our wives and daughters . So you outsource it . Why not ? Leithian girls make excellent Vessels , raised in an entirely organic environment . And what 's in it for the surrogates ? The distinction of incubating us future leaders of the Quad , of course . I 'm guessing it 's not all rosy , if you came all the way here . If the Lahani line were to die out , their lands and Company seat could be annexed by any of the other Nine . The last time such a thing happened , the resulting War of the Nines shook the entire Quad . So , you want my team to escort the surrogate to Qresh , so the heir can inherit the child 's lands and title ? My ancestors began the Vessel program , and our line continue to be its patrons . Some want the Lahani heir protected . Some want him dead . I must appear to be non-partisan , so I need this done cleanly , quietly . And no one can know I was ever involved . Discretion is my team 's specialty . Good . A less discreet person might ask why a lowborn Killjoy possesses an instrument reserved for female royalty in other parts of the J. It came with the ship . One question , my lady . To come all this way personally , why the sudden urgency ? Where is the baby ? We have no idea . LUCY : Approaching Westerley . Initiating descent . D 'AVIN : 0-87229 . ( CHIMES ) LUCY " . Congratulations on receiving your Reclamation Agent Certificate . Level Four . D 'avin Jaqobis . Well , thank you , ship . And now , I need to find someone . Name input . Dr. Pim Jaegar . Searching . ( ALARM BLARING ) Shit . Yeah . It 's pretty annoying . Damn it , John . What did you do ? Changed the mainframe search parameters to alert me in case of a breach . ( ALARM STOPS ) You 're the breach . You set a trap for me . You say tomato , I say that 's what you get for not confiding in your brother . Ah . ( SIGHS ) It 's true . Who is she ? An army doc . All I know is she 's in the Quad . She 's why you 're here ? John . Look , D 'av , whatever . The point is , I 'm a Killjoy . Finding people is literally what I do . You won 't even tell me who you 're looking for ? That 's bullshit . So , that Delle Seyah seemed like a piece of work , huh ? ( EXHALES ) I just wish you 'd told me first , instead of Dutch . Some things are easier to tell a stranger than your little brother . I got my head a bit scrambled during my last combat mission . I think this doctor can help . That 's it . Don 't make a deal . I can handle this on my own . Okay ? DUTCH : Boys ? With me . LUCY " . Docking at Westerley . What do you mean , they lost the baby ? How do you lose a baby ? Right ? I 've met babies . They 're very slow . Are you done ? Our baby has not been born yet . The target is a surrogate . The monastery where she 's living is cloistered . No men in , no girls out . But the abbess has sent daily health reports to the Nine . Last week , the monastery went dark . Delle Seyah sent her people to investigate . ( JOHN SIGHS ) Damn . And our target ? Missing . The remaining sisters have all gone underground . They won 't even reply to the Nine . If she won 't talk to her employers , then how are we supposed to find her ? With a little help from our friends . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Where 's your ID , Scarback ? Enjoying your work , Officer ? I 'll be praying for you tonight . ( BEEPS ) And your family . DUTCH : Keep sassing them , and one day , I 'll be bailing your ass from jail . Company punks ? They 're too scared of my kind . You look well . I feel well . I 'm great , too , by the way . Is that the new one ? Yeah , I 'm the new one . Nice cape . So , any news on the monastery massacre ? One survivor . The abbess . My people have been in touch with her . She says to tell you that the girl is safe . Girl 's name is Constance . Once the abbess heard she was carrying the last of the Lahani line , she moved her . Moved her where ? Safe house . Only the abbess and one other sister knows the location . This will get you to the safe house . The abbess has one condition . You trust no one , tell no one , until the girl is safe on Qreshi soil . I know how to do my job , Alvis . And I 'm just doing mine . Hang on . These coordinates can 't be right . Why ? Where are we heading ? JOHN : I love the badlands . DUTCH : Just admit it , John , we 're lost . JOHN : I don 't get lost . Coordinates say this is the location . Except it isn 't . This is our fourth jaunt past that cliff face . And the perfect chance to enjoy a refreshing beverage . D 'AVIN : So , why can 't we just fly in ? Because we can 't take Lucy this deep . The sand here , it reflects electromagnetics . It fries the navs , whatever . Besides , wasn 't that fun ? DUTCH : Let me simplify , Rookie . Bad air make ship go boom . Badlands are what the Company leaves behind after they strip an area bare . Hell of a place to hide a baby maker for blue bloods . Clever . Nobody will think to look in the most toxic place in the Quad . Hey . Does that horizon look hinky ? Whoa , easy with the technical terms . He 's right . There 's no lichen growing on the escarpment , even though it faces south . Security projection . Nice eye . Johnny ! You should see your guys ' faces . ( CHUCKLES ) What 's back there ? Just more badlands . Come on . Oh , and a giant fortress . Get the Rambler . Nice place for a safe house . Unless it 's just another trick . Some tech-mirage . With a front door ? JOHN : Time to ring the doorbell . Ladies first . Rarely , in my experience . Then , they 're doing it wrong . I 'll be the lady . Yes , ma 'am . ( EXHALES ) Moment of truth . This is a bad time to discover I 'm claustrophobic . Sure hope they built this place to code . Shh . This could be an ambush , look alive . Here they are . This is officially my favorite ambush ever . It 's okay . We 're here to help . Are you here to take us to Qresh ? Which one of you is Constance ? lam . Nuns . With guns . DUTCH : That 's different . Easy , sisters . I knew Leith 's silence was a portent . You 're scaring the girls . Let us explain . Shut up . What are you doing ? MOTHER SAL : They 're not here to rescue us , girl . They 're here to execute you . Put down the guns . We work for the RAC . We have a warrant . That 's bullshit . Drop them . You want an act of faith ? Here 's one . I haven 't killed you yet . The abbess sent us . We 're here to extract the surrogate immediately . ( EXHALES ) JOHN : What 's wrong with her ? She 's eight months pregnant . Sister Therese . Take Constance to her room , and then check the perimeter . You . Dutch . Tell me about the others on Leith . Ladies , be kind to these rakes . Apparently , they 're our honored guests . Well , this should go well . Everyone at the birthing sanctuary ? Except the abbess . I could have been there when they attacked . I could have been killed . There 's a chance that whoever did it is heading here now . We need to evacuate . Right now ? No . Constance is on bed rest . She took a turn for the worse when transferring here . Aren 't we all safer in here , anyway ? My team 's job is to transport people . We 're very good at it . I can keep Constance safe . MERCENARY : Their tracks continue through here . Get the gear . CLARA : So , you 're brothers ? Yeah . I love brothers . Do you guys like being Killjoys ? And flying around and stuff ? Totally . Stuff is great . It 's feeding time in the lion 's den . And you 're the meat . MOTHER SAL : No , you 're wrong . Please , she has to stabilize or she could go into labor . So , stabilize her . Projection camouflage . Hermetically sealed from the elements . Shock-shielding on perimeter . All the precautions have been taken . The danger is out there . In here , we are perfectly safe . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) You were saying ? AUTOMATED VOICE : System down . Security disabled . Air purifiers compromised . What 's going on ? I bet a bird flew into the grid again . Sister Therese is outside , patrolling the perimeter . There 's no need to panic . Get the girls to a more secure place . Check on Constance . Lock her down . Okay , ladies , let 's get lower where it 's nice and cool . I 'll monitor the grid . See if I can boot it up internally . You can . Well , I can . Then , you 'd better come along . You go with the girls . I 'll sweep . HEY - Don 't you think it would be better if , you know , you stayed with them ? Why , because I have breasts ? Sort of . Wait , is that , like , a trick question ? They like you , okay ? You 're a big muscle-y distraction , and we need that right now . Look , our warrant is for Constance , remember ? And when it comes down to it , she 's the one we need to save . How do you think the others will react once they figure that bit out ? No idea . Neither do you . Trust me , I know . I grew up in a place just like this . You grew up in a fertility cult ? Okay , not exactly like this . What you 'd probably call a " royal harem . " Long story , another time . Here 's how it works . Treat people like chattel , make them fight for approval , and they will always turn on one another in the end . You 've seen them . They 're basically brainwashed . And probably really , really scared . ( SCOFFS ) Not everybody is as hard as you , Dutch . I didn 't start out this way . Someone 's patched this together with fusion gel and duct tape . Unconventional . It 's impressive . Improvised . It was you ? I was re-routing harvest drones to terrorize my sisters when I was knee-high to a copter pod . And now you 're a surrogate for Qreshi nobles who can 't , or won 't , make their own babies . How 'd that happen ? Constance , Clara , Gwen , we 're all daughters of farmers on Leith who didn 't need any more daughters . This is how we serve our families . Constance . Hi , I 'm Dutch . The lady Killjoy . I 'd get up , but ... I know you 're not very well , but we really need to leave . Now . I 'm ready . I may be weak , but this baby is very strong . These days , I feel him moving a lot . But he has to wait . The Lahani heir is only legitimate if he 's born on Qreshi soil . Am I boring you ? Sorry . Evaluating security . Part of my job . Yes , and listening to me wax poetic about my vow of bounty isn 't . I get it . Your beliefs are none of my business . I 'm the only one of the girls that was able to conceive this round . That 's great . No , I need to see it through . That 's not faith , it 's fact . Oh , you need a dirk . You 're bossy . You 're also right . So , we all took and passed the purity test together . It takes a lot of sacrifices to be fit for service . No booze , no boys , no flesh . Not even bacon . No room for a career . No chance to build your own copter pods . Why ? Traditions die hard . You know the old joke . What do you get when you scratch a Leithian ? What ? A Qreshi ancestor who 's embarrassed to be there . We 're all descendants of some Qreshi fourth or fifth son , sent to Leith when land got scarce . Some see honor in keeping that connection alive . So , what do you get when you scratch a Westerlyn ? Scabies ? ( CHUCKLES ) Sorry . No , it 's okay , we just dock there . Anyway , my family gets paid three times for my honor , what I 'd make as an engineer , so ... Maybe you 're underestimating how good an engineer you could have been . I 've thought about it . Look , those girls are my real family now . I 'd do anything for them . Please don 't tell them that I sometimes have doubts . Not even if they bribe me with bacon . DUTCH : Where have you been ? I told you to stay with her . I know how to protect my girls . I 've been doing it for 23 years , missy . ( FOOTSTEPS THUDDING ) Did you bring someone up with you ? Stay with Constance . For real this time . Lock the doors . I 'll be right back . And I mean now . I always wanted a big brother . You two close ? Well , we used to be . Now it 's all his secrets hiding from my secrets . Your secrets ? We just met and I know your blood type and why you don 't like pie . Be cake or be pudding . But commit . Why , yes . I 'd love to dance . Oh , you like to lead ? So do I. ( GRUNTS ) I think there 's something really wrong . Look , a short this size is only possible if the surge was external . Big . Deliberate . Not a bird ? More like a satellite . I can override the system , but ... Who sent you ? Leith nationalists or the Nine ? ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( SYSTEM POWERING UP ) You are a special snowflake , John Jaqobis . We weren 't down for long . By my count , eleven minutes without security . That 's long enough . For what ? For whoever cut the power to get inside . Whoever 's paying , we 'll double it . Go to hell , listy slag . The Nine it is . Thanks . JOHN : Dutch , you okay ? COMMANDER : All we want is the Lahani breeder . Send her outside and no one else will die . No one else ? Sister Therese . ( SHUDDERS ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( SOBBING ) Leithian breeder . I 'm coming for you . ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) Mercenaries ? I offered him more money . A true merc would have at least heard me out . Look at his hands , his gear . This is pure Qreshi house guard in disguise . No colors , no crests . So , no way to tell which of the Nine families he was working for . Great . I 'm going out there . No , you 're not . WOMAN : Stay here . It 's safe . And next stop , hair pulling . Ladies . Hey ! What the hell am I watching ? Clara , let her go . Jenny , put on your damn shoe . And you , sobbing helps exactly zero percent . He knows their names ? Sorry , D 'avin . Apology accepted , Clara . Now , go get Constance . He knows their names . JENNY : Hey . Can we get to your ship already ? It 's parked a few miles away . Through the badlands ? No . Surrogates can 't breathe Westerlyn air . It will negate Constance 's status . So will dying . We can get halfway there through the tunnels . Her room 's empty . Stop . I 'm sorry , Constance. lam . But if the brigands get in here , it 's rape and murder for everyone . They shot Sister Therese in the head . I never took you for a coward . Yeah . Cowards survive . Eight failed implantations , living off the crumbs of charity . I 've given enough to bounty . Playing brood mare to Qreshis isn 't a higher calling . That 's just a story we tell idiot girls like you to get control of your wombs . Shut your mouth . Well , I knew someone would go full bitch . Just didn 't think it would be Mother Inferior . If we give them the girl , the rest of us stand a chance . It 's triage . It 's fair . It 's pathetic . Let go of the girl . I won 't risk my life for this baby . L will . ( GASPS ) DUTCH : It 's okay . You 're okay . Just breathe . Look at me . It 's okay . What do you care ? You haven 't stopped judging us since the moment you got here . You think we 're stupid ? No . I think you 're really brave . But you have been manipulated . And I know what that 's like , and I 'm not going to do that to you now . Forget the bounty , forget the Nine . What do you want ? I 'm not a quitter . ( STUTTERS ) I promised the Lahanis that I would continue their line . Constance . Don 't patronize me . Being a Vessel is my calling and it matters to me . Mother Sal doesn 't get a say in that , and neither do you . Okay . Good . I want to finish this . For the baby and for me . Will you help us ? I 'm no quitter either . But I can 't make any promises about your baby blanket . ( LOUD THUD ) They 're coming through the doors . How many do you figure are out there ? A few more than us , probably better armed . Says who ? ( BEEPS ) ( WHISTLES ) Damn , girl . CONSTANCE : Pass me the flash rifle . Clara , take the mags . DUTCH : My kind of girls . JOHN : ls that a flamethrower ? You sure you can handle your weapons ? Please . We 're country girls from Leith . We learned how to fire a rifle before we learned to thresh . Okay . Let 's do this . All right , listen up . We need your help covering us through the tunnels in case we 're not alone in there . Once we get to the door , you reseal it and sit tight . We 're not leaving Constance . This is their baby , too . They 're coming . Looks like it 's all for one . And one for me . All right . Let 's go . You sure you wouldn 't rather just carry the hammer ? Cute . But I think I 'm going to stick with my plasma grenades . I get it . Respect the classics . John . Thanks . Stay close , okay ? ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTING ) JOHN : Hey , we need to keep moving . JENNY : Her pulse is faint . Heartbeat 's erratic . Deep breaths , Mama . Why didn 't he kill me ? They must need you alive . Guardians of royal children control their lands . Maybe that 's why they want the baby . Steal the kid , steal the land ? That only works if the baby lives . Put me in the front . I can act as a shield for the others . You 're too weak . Let 's move , people ! Now ! I have a synthesized adrenaline shot . I stole it from the matron 's cabinet . What will that do to the baby ? Keep me alive long enough to get to Qresh . JOHN : Incoming ! Is it working ? Oh , yeah . Come on . ( GRUNTS ) CLARA : Constance . CLARA : What do we do now ? I 'll lay cover . Clear a path to the Rambler . We 'll bring up the rear . So , move your pregnant ass . Move it ! Clara , watch your back ! CLARA : They shot Sarah . Johnny , on your left ! My left or a normal person 's left ? Jakkhole . Shit ! He shanked the coupler . DUTCH : I 'm down to my quarter tank of petrol . ( GRUNTS ) CLARA : Oh , my God . Gwen . They got Gwen . Running low on ammo . JENNY : You 'll need two minutes to reboot . We don 't have two minutes . I 'll buy them for you . Just promise me you 're going to get these girls back home . No . No , no , no . Jen . Jenny , it 's not worth it . Of course it is . They 're my sisters . Jenny ! No ! DUTCH : Jenny , what are you doing ? Jenny , come back . It 's the breeder . Hold your fire . JOHN : Jenny ! Constance , you 're okay . I 'm sorry about your friends . Just hang in there . I can 't anymore . Yes , you can . Don 't quit now . You 've been so brave . You 're not listening to me . I 'm having this baby , now ! LUCY " . Initiating launch . DUTCH : Johnny ? Get us the hell out of here . We need to get to Qresh . LUCY : My cargo bay is not equipped for this situation . Can you reschedule ? Use your anger . It 's just pain . Then you do it . Where are we at ? Her contractions are getting closer together . Is that good ? We don 't do this part . They take us to the best doctors on Qresh . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) We should take her to Old Town . It 's closer . No . The baby has to be born on Qresh to claim his Lahani birthright . If we fail , then all of that was for nothing . They all just died for nothing . We have to try . We 'll do more than try . JOHN : Dutch . I need a word . I got this . ( CONSTANCE GROANING ) D 'AVIN : All right . Status ? Royally forked . Emphasis on royal . I 'm not getting a landing code . ( CONSOLE BEEPS ) ( SIGHS ) And now being denied airspace access full stop . Delle Seyah revoked our clearance ? Why would she do that ? Court politics are a bitch . But so am I . Lucy , get me Delle Seyah . LUCY " . Contacting . Excuse me . I didn 't think I 'd hear from you . We 're in stratosphere . I have the cargo onboard , but we 're being denied entry . One of the other Nine must be blocking you . I can 't help with that . Lady , we need to land . And I needed discretion . Instead , the other families are gossiping about dead Vessels in the desert . And you want to connect me to that ? This plan is no longer viable . And this baby is about to be viable in the hold of my ship . Not on Qreshi soil , therefore not a trueborn Nine . I have no obligation to a random baby . Who made the better offer ? Hmm ? Which family bought you out ? There are delicate politics at play here you cannot begin to understand , so let me say it simply . You failed me , Killjoy . I will not soon forget it . We 're going in . Dutch , there 's bending the law , and then there 's breaking it . Shields still at 90 % . We are talking about going up against the Nine . Against Delle Seyah . She could have us staked in Black Rain , Dutch . And by the time she 's done with us , we might be begging to be . If she didn 't want us to finish the job , she shouldn 't have hired me . And the last thing she wants is publicity . Constance , two more minutes . Let that baby know who 's boss . And hold on . LUCY : John , we have Company ships on our tail . BORDER PATROL : Hailing . You have unlawfully entered Qreshi airspace and will be shot down if you do not pull up . Do not attempt to land . We will execute with impunity . I respectfully hold on that , Border Patrol . We are RAC agents with an active warrant . This must be some sort of mistake . We 're disabling our weaponry . Let 's figure this out . GUARD : You , come with me . Secure the perimeter ! ( BABY CRYING ) LUCY " . Bio spill in cargo bay . I 'll have a look . I 'm sure everything is fine . GUARD : You were told not to land . My lady was very clear . We have a valid RAC warrant . Which is why your ship is still intact . Get back onboard or I 'll splatter this grass with gray matter . That 's a bit extreme . I liked it . Felt like it came from a real place . We 're just here to drop off some precious cargo . Delle Seyah Kendry , of Land Kendry . May I introduce the latest Qreshi citizen . ( BABY CRYING ) Trueborn , on mother soil . Your soil . Thanks to you , the Lahani line lives on . Praise the trees . The Nine are whole again . Welcome home , little one . ( COOING ) I 've overlooked that the surrogates breathed polluted Westerley air . As far as everyone else knows , the girls remain 100 % pure . Well , I imagine that 's to your advantage , now that you 're the heir 's legal guardian . You , uh , made me a few enemies tonight . Reckless move , forcing my hand . Not really . When your enemy has two faces , strike a deal with both . ( CHUCKLES ) You can 't be serious . You 've read Derhlek ? Only the simple words . Well , go on , then . Amuse me , Killjoy . What are my two faces ? By my count , you 're a decent person genuinely trying to protect the surrogates . Or a ruthless politician who either used me to find the girls so that you could attack them , or cut a deal with the persons who did . What 's your bet ? Even odds . But I can make either work . If you are a decent person , the baby is safe . And if I 'm a scheming opportunist ? He 's even safer . Qreshis can 't bequeath land until they turn 18 , and you 've no claim to his without him . So , good or evil , it 's now in your best interest to do everything in your power to keep him safe . Well , aren 't you a pearl hiding in the muck . Thank you ? It 's a compliment . You have an unusual grasp of statecraft , for a woman with calloused hands . I could use someone of your complexity . Now , get off my property before I have you shot . I like her . Find out everything you can . That was the most painful , terrifying experience of my life . Why can 't I stop staring at his fingernails ? I 've heard they 've asked you to stay on as his nanny . I always hoped they would . He was never really mine , but I hoped I would stay in his life , teach him about my home . Help raise a Qreshi leader who understands Leith . There 's certainly time . I need you to take Clara and I home . No . Your farm ? That 's not my home anymore . Don 't say you 're staying a Vessel . No . A guardian . Coach other girls through this honor . You know it 's not honor . It 's whatever we make of it . You asked me to figure out what I want . This is what I want . Someone has to protect the Vessels for as long as the girls are called to serve . And after everything they gave up for me , how could I abandon my sisters ? They 'll be lucky to have you . You ready ? No . ( COOING ) ( DOOR OPENING ) Girls are finally asleep . Algae brew ? She was on Qresh . The capital city . Madidus . Who ? Dr. Jaegar . Was ? There 's no sign of her after she stepped off the transport that brought her to this system . But someone , they paid significant joy for a solid cleanup job . So , that 's it . Well , she 'll have left a trail , a clue . I mean , they always do . I didn 't ask for your help , John . What ? Yeah , but you should have , dipshit . I 'm your brother . This doc , can she fix you ? I don 't know . Maybe . Okay . So then , we search , we find out . But Dutch has to be in on it . She 's family , too . Okay . Meaning don 't plow our sister . Remind me . Was that on the Jaqobis family crest ? I 've seen how you look at her . D 'av , this is almost working . We are a good team , ( SIGHS ) but we could be great . So , don 't mess that up for us . I won 't . I promise . DUTCH : Promise what ? That next time I get to pick the damn warrant . I , uh , got to go do a thing . I don 't know exactly what happened to you in that rich kid orphanage of yours . But you came out the other side clean . Don 't ever think otherwise .

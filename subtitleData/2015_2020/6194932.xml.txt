 ( soft gasps ) ( heartbeat rhythm ) ( gasping ) ( crying out ) ( panting ) ( moaning ) ( sobbing ) - ( man ) I 'm here . - ( exhaling ) Jonas . - Yes , my love . - ( sobs ) It hurts . - I know . - ( panting ) I need medicine . I 'm sorry , my love , there 's no more time . It has to be now . ( gasping sobs ) Not ready . I 'm too weak . None of us were ever as strong as you . I don 't want anyone else to die because of me . They 'll be hunted ... born or unborn . - ( groans ) - You can give them a fighting chance . ( gasps , crying out ) ( moans , gasping ) ( groans ) ( gasps ) ( whispers ) I see them . ( panting ) You did it . Protect them . They 're here . - ( tires screech outside ) - So is he . - Fight him . - I can 't . So this is how you 've been hiding from me ? Does he know ? You 're giving birth . Oh ... It 's painful . I can feel it . Whatever he 's saying , remember what he has done . - ( woman ) Go . - Is that Jonas ? Please . Tell him I 'm looking forward to meeting him . I love you . - I love you . - Aw , does he know you 're lying ? Stop . Or is that still our little secret ? Angelica . I ... I can 't do it ... not if you 're here . I will always be here ... just as you will always be here . Oh , come now , my dear , how many times have you made that threat ? - And we both know you won 't do it . - ( gasping breaths ) You can 't . You are one of us , and there 's still so much work to be done . - You 're coming home , with me . - ( door opens ) No . - Give me the gun . - Put the gun down . No . ( sniffles ) Stop her ! ( girl whispers ) Will , help me . ( crickets chirping ) Will ... help me . Please . ( water gurgling nearby ) ( whispers ) Help me . ( water dripping ) ( shot echoes ) ( high-pitched screeching tone ) ( groans ) ( dance music playing ) OK . ( dance music continues , muffled ) Hello ? Hello ? It 's your neighbor . Hey , open up ! This is the police ! ( music stops ) ( dance music playing ) She can spin for a girl , can 't she ? She can spin . Period . Sure . I don 't care . I didn 't dress for you . I dressed for what is actually cool ... Oh , hey , baby . Oh , hey ... that set was on fire , man . Yeah , the vibe was crackin ' , Riles . It was like a ... like a tight leash around me goolies . Seen a lot of people play here . It doesn 't feel like that . - Thank you . - This is the guy I was telling you about . Everybody calls me Nyx . Gotta come with us , man . The shit that he has got has got the power to blow our fuckin ' brains out . ( chuckles ) - ( mimicking gunshots ) - ( laughs ) - Sorry , really bad migraine . - I get it . All that energy and emotion . Tell him about your freak out in the park . - Jacks , you fuckin ' dick . - No , it 's cool , man . Nyx , he gets it . He said you had a vision . No , it was too many drugs . ( dramatic orchestral music plays ) My son ? Tino ! Don 't do this . Don 't do this , I beg of you ! I love you ! I love you ! - It 's too late . - Tino . Have you come to confess your sins , my son ? No , Padre . I 've come to blow your fucking brains out . What ? I 'm sorry , are we going off script ? ( man ) Cut ! Cut ! ( groans ) Padre , take five . Lito , what is going on with you ? Yesterday , you were having visions - of suicidal angels ... - I 'm sorry . ... and today you can 't remember your lines . ( softly ) Are you OK , baby ? I don 't know . I 'm not feeling myself today . I don 't need you to be yourself . I need you to be this guy , Tino El Caído . - Right . - El Caído . - Right , right . OK . - El Caído , cabrón ! - Let 's do it . - OK , people ! Let 's set up for the close-up right here ! ( phone beeps ) ( woman over intercom ) Ms. Bak , your brother 's assistant called . She said he still wasn 't here , and Mr. Yuen has just arrived . I 'll meet Mr. Yuen in the conference room . Ni hao , Mr. Yuen . You do us a great service with your presence this morning . - Who are you ? - I 'm Sun Bak , Vice President and Chief Financial Officer . Ahh . The sister . Where is your brother ? He was ... unavoidably detained . But I will be happy to walk you through our proposal . Look , I 'm here to close . Women don 't close things . They open them . Excuse me ? ( voice echoes ) If Joong-Ki is not here , that means Bak is not ready to ... Tan-Wu ! ( chuckles ) You sly old fox . Did I see you at Min-Ji 's ? ( continues indistinctly ) Hey , sis , go get us a couple coffees . Come this way . My nieces come downstairs , two little birds , they climb onto the couch , and cuddle up in my arms . Now we 're close and all , but we 've never done nothing like this in their lives . We didn 't know it yet , but that exact moment , my sister was at the supermarket , and she started bleeding bad . Something internal . There was blood everywhere , and they had to call an ambulance , but my nieces knew . - They knew about my sister . - Knew . Somehow they just knew she was in trouble . Limbic resonance . It 's a language older than our species . He thinks that 's what happened to you in the park , and it 's all got to do with this chemical , DMT . ( Nyx ) It 's a simple molecule present in all living things . Scientists talk about it being part of an eco-biological synaptic network . When people take it , they see their birth , their death , worlds beyond this one . They talk of truth ... connection ... transcendence . - ( thunder rumbling ) - ( rain pattering ) Dad ? Dad , where are the umbrellas ? I can 't find the umbrellas . What do you need an umbrella for ? Please , no jokes . I 'm late already . I have a big meeting , and I can 't show up dripping wet . Umbrellas are upstairs , but you don 't need one . Look , the sun is shining . It 's going to be a beautiful day . But , I heard it . Maybe you shouldn 't be going to work . It 's so close to the wedding . - Dad , you know work is important to me . - I know . You sent me to university to get a degree , not to find a husband . - I know . - I heard thunder , and rain . Maybe what you heard was the sound of your father 's tears , thinking how soon he is going to have to give his daughter away . I thought you were happy I was getting married . Tears can be happy ... and sad . ( thunder rumbling ) We are born into this world the same way we shall leave it : alone . Our only comfort , the only presence that remains constant , is the love of our Father in heaven . You all right ? Migraine . I 'm like Grandpa Hassan up there . Cold and pickled ? I dream big , like he did . Nothing petty , like you two . That 's all you 'll ever be , petty thieves . Not me . My next score is gonna be huge . Legendary . When you hear about it , your dicks are gonna shrivel . I 'm not sure what 'll give me more pleasure ... the money , or seeing his face . My son . Why are you so good to me ? You are my one and only mother . You gave me the light and love in my heart . ( sighs ) I have to go . Goodbye , my zebra . I have this feeling . I 'm going to have a really good day today . ( rooster crows ) ( train horn blares ) " When the streets are a jungle , there can only be one king . " ( chuckles ) ( woman moaning ) Oh , God . Yeah . Oh , God . ( breathing faster ) Oh , God . ( crying out ) ( moaning ) ( laughing ) Oh ... ( sighs ) ( sighs ) ( chuckles ) Good ? - ( chuckles ) - Did that help honey 's headache ? I can 't answer that , because you literally just fucked my brains out . ( laughs ) And here I always thought that was a figurative expression . - Happy Pride . - Happy Pride . ( phone chimes ) Oh ... come on . ( phone chimes ) ( gasps ) It 's Shawn . He 's asking if I can work the charity box at the show tonight ! - I sense a costume opportunity . - Ah ... It 's for a good cause . Who are you ? Who am I ? Blow your fucking brains out . Where 's that coming from ? ( inhales deeply ) Tino El Caído . I 'm the fallen one . ( sighs ) ( practices tongue trills ) Pah-pah-pah-pah ! Who am I ? I 'm Tino El Caído . I 'm the fallen one . And you 're a liar . You 're a liar . I 'm Tino El Caído . ( sighs ) I 'm Tino El Caído . I 'm the fallen one . Diet Coke , please ! What happened in my past nobody knows , not the writers , not the directors . I 'm a man ... Bah ! Bah-pah ! ( slurping ) A man with a haunted past , that 's what the script says . Bah-bah ! ( low vocalizing ) ( sighing ) What are you doing to me ? ( whispers indistinctly ) - ( knocking at door ) - Yeah ? Hey . Hey . Just checking everything is OK . Yeah . - Yeah ? - Everything 's OK . I just thought maybe I did something wrong . No , no . Please , no . You were great . You were fantastic . It was me that , you know , I ... You 're just always so perfect . I don 't know what is going on with me . Maybe there 's something that I can help you with ? ( exhales ) ( belt buckle jingling ) Wait , wait . Wait , Cassandra . There is nothing I 'd like more . If only my heart did not belong to another . ( sighs ) I 'm sorry . - ( sighs ) - She 's a very lucky woman . I 'm sorry . I ... I 'm sorry . ( door slams ) Thank you for coming . It means a lot to us . Sorry , Auntie . Last few days , all he talked about was your father . Saddest day in his life , the day your father died . You should go say hello . We 'll wait for you . Pay your respects . He was your father . ( unzips pants ) - ( sniffs ) - ( zips pants ) ( overlapping chatter ) ( whistling ) ( man speaks foreign language ) ( whistles , speaks foreign language ) ( whistles ) ( speaks foreign language ) - Yes ? - When are we leaving ? - Right now . - I have to be downtown by nine . You 'll be there long before nine , Ma 'am . Come rain or shine , Van Damn is always on time . - We need to go . - We need more customers . We 're barely covering the cost of gas . We don 't need customers , we need a Facebook page . - Look at this . - ( sighs ) Jela . ( engine starting ) ( moans ) Every day is the same . Everybody loves Bat Van . You dumb fucks ! No one gives a shit about Van Damn ! ( cackling ) ( sighs ) - Maybe he 's right . - No . - Maybe Jean-Claude 's time is over . - No ! Never ! Come on , Capheus , Van Damme is a man . He doesn 't need costumes and gadgets to fight . He fights with the fist and with his heart . Come on ! The Muscles from Brussels never die . Don 't forget that . - Come on . - ( speaks foreign language ) - And get us more customers . - I will . - ( man ) Excuse me . - Whoo ! ( laughs ) Jean Claude is watching over us . Yes , sir , are you going to the city ? - Yes , please . - Then take a seat . - No , but I 've got no money . - Um ... Everyone must pay . - Here . - What am I supposed to do with this ? This is worth more than the fare . Look , I believe you , but how do I return change out of a chicken ? - Save me an egg . - ( chicken squawking ) - ( squawks ) - ( screams ) ( soft gasp ) ( sighs ) ( phone beeps ) ( woman ) Ms. Bak , I have Mr. Jong from Seoul Citibank on the line again . ( Sun ) Tell Mr. Jong that I 'm in a meeting . ( sighs ) ( indistinct chatter ) Hang on . Riley ! Hey ! Me and Nocker have been waitin ' for you . Sorry . I thought you 'd gone already . Nyx has invited us up to his place . Oh , look , maybe tomorrow , OK ? Riles , this is important . Look , this headache is killing me . Tomorrow , OK ? OK ... The stuff that he 's talking about , that is exactly what you need . ( voice echoes indistinctly ) ( rock music playing ) ( inaudible dialogue ) Oh ! ( laughing ) Whoo ! ( laughs ) - Hi ! - Remember your first brownie ? Our first Pride . Your lips ... are so ... amazing . My God , we were so high . - ( both giggling ) - Oh , my God , we were . ( man ) Are you following me ? - Need some delicious , nutritious stuff ? - Um ... Maybe this is what you need . - ( man ) Yeah . - OK , OK , we 'll take one . ( man 1 ) Yeah . All right . - ( man 2 ) Go for it . - How much ? You 'll never be the same again . - OK , OK . OK , OK . - Thank you very much . Happy journey . - Happy Pride ! - Happy Pride ! Bye ! ( giggles ) ( both ) Mm ... ( sighs ) But you know what I remember best about that day ? ( pop music playing ) ( giggling ) Hey , y 'all , this is the one I 've been talking about . Wait , I know you . You 're the tranny that blogs about politics . I totally disagree with what you said about dropping LGBT . - Hey , come on , relax . It 's a party . - We fought hard for that recognition . I just thought that the distinctions were separating us . Bullshit . Just another colonizing male trying to take up any space left to women . Sam , say one more thing about my girlfriend and I will colonize your face with my fist . - Oh , yeah ? - I 'm gonna go . Oh , please . She 's a loud-mouth Berkeley bitch . - Fuck you . - Fuck you ! Hey , No ... Nomi ! Wait ! Honey , what is it ? You never cry at stuff like that . I 'm not crying because of her . Then what ? I 'm crying because no one 's ever defended me before . Mwah ! That 's the day I knew I 'd always love you . ( overlapping chatter ) ( bell rings nearby ) ( tolls ) My Lord Ganesha . I hope you like this modak . I made it especially for you . I put peanuts on top . ( chuckles ) I mean , of course , these gifts come without any attachments or obligations . I am trying to become a better person . I know I am not important enough to deserve your attention when there are so many terrible things wrong in this world . I can 't tell you how bad I feel even being here , because I know I shouldn 't be asking you this . But I have no one else to turn to . OK , um ... this weekend , I am to marry a very important man , who you probably know , Rajan Rasal . Um , he is the son of the owner of the pharmaceutical company where I work . He 's very smart and very handsome , and all the women at the company want desperately to marry him , but he never took an interest in anyone ... except me . I should tell you , I have never seen my parents so full of joy as when they received his proposal . I mean , I thought they were excited when I received my degree from university . Maybe you saw my dad , like , dancing around the house . ( sighs ) How could I say no ? I mean , Rajan is , according to everyone , including my mom 's astrologer , the perfect husband for me . Except for one little fact . ( sighs ) I do not love him . ( whirring ) After you left the funeral ... Sergei started blowing on about your dad . Said there wasn 't a better box man in the world than your dad , now or ever . Said the only reason your dad got caught was because he was obsessed with trying to crack an SD safe . Said they 're uncrackable . Said your father was an idiot for trying . You sure that gets us in ? Am I sure ? You notice the sign outside ? See you tomorrow . Wolfgang ? The safe in the house , it 's one of them SD 's , isn 't it ? ( groans ) - ( dance music playing ) - Give ' til it hearts , baby . My box needs filling ! Mm , thank you , baby . Hi ! - Oh ! - Wow , she is amazing . Neets loves her charity work . - Thanks for coming . - Oh , my God , of course . - We 're so excited to see your new piece . - A bit nervous about it , actually . - Why ? - Well , it 's kind of a downer . - So ? - This is Pride . People want to feel good . I don 't . During the ' 80s , Pride was a funeral march . I know . I want to remember that . I want to connect to that . I want to show people how my life and all of this is made possible by those lives and those deaths . ( solemn cello music plays ) ( man ) I walked in the room and saw a man in his early 30s who looked like he was 92 , who was skin and bones , who weighed maybe 80 pounds , who was on a respirator . ( sighs ) And , uh ... ( voice breaking ) and he said , he said to me ... " Do me this ... You 've gotta do me a favor . " And I said , " Whatever it is , just ask . " And he said , " I can 't go on like this . " He said , " You know , I just ... If you could , just carry me up to the roof and throw me over the ... roof . " He goes , " I only weigh about 80 pounds , and you 're strong , you could do it . " And then I said , " Jay , I can 't do that . You can 't ask that of me . " And when he died , they came in ... in hazmat ... ( voice breaks ) suits , and they put him in a body bag . ( cello music fades ) ( heartbeat rhythm ) ( applause ) It 's like I was there . I could feel the wind coming in through the broken windows . The smell of burnt mattress . It didn 't seem like a dream . Maybe you were astro-projecting , like Dr. Strange . Why would I expect anything different from you ? - Officer Strange . - Fuck off . Officer Strange . Whoo ! That 's your name . ( indistinct taunting ) Every time I come down here , I remember how much you can actually feel how much they hate us . Gangbangers hate cops , cops hate gangbangers . It 's natural . How 's that natural ? ( train passing overhead ) Like dogs hate cats . They 're the enemy . You certainly got plenty of reason to hate them . After what they did to your old man ? Shit , I 'd never forgive something like that . ( man over radio ) One-Adam-12 , we have a report of gunfire . Eleven-12 , 10-4 . With any luck , there 'll be a few less cats in the world . - Let 's get ' em , cowboy . - ( siren wailing ) ( door unlocks ) Open sesame . ( beeps ) ( siren wailing ) - ( tires screech ) - ( horn honks ) ( siren continues , faint ) Was that a siren ? Huh ? Didn 't hear anything . You know I brought a drill . There 's no shame in drilling . ( mutters softly ) ( soft clicking ) - ( music plays indistinctly on headphones ) - ( soft clicking continues ) - ( music continues on headphones ) - ( siren wailing in distance ) ( siren continues in distance ) - ( siren wailing ) - ( tires screech ) ( siren stops ) ( gunfire ) Shots fired . Requesting backup . ( gasping breaths ) Help me . - ( man ) What happened ? - ( boy panting ) Gunshot wound . Looks like a hollow point . - Get an ambulance . - What ? - You heard me . - What do you think this is , TV ? Ain 't no ambulance coming to Chi-raq for a gunshot . Not fast enough to make a difference anyway . The fuck you doing , Gorski ? Hey . What 's your name , kid ? - Deshawn . - Deshawn , I 'm Will . I need you to press this as hard as you can . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Press as hard as you can . - Are you kidding me ? - ( Will grunts ) I know you , Diego . You do not want to stand there and let this kid die either . That 's what he 'd do if it was you or me . Goddamnit . ( soft clicking ) Fifty-eight minutes . ( exhales ) Fuck . ( exhales ) Hey , hey , hey . Hey . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . What 's this ? We 're throwing in the towel ? I need a break . Hey , you understand we got less than an hour , unless I 'm wrong and Steiner 's early , then we got less than that . You 're never wrong about shit like that . - ( dance music plays on TV ) - ( audience cheers ) Really ? ( whispers ) Really ? It relaxes me . This shit relaxes you ? - ( siren wailing ) - ( tires screeching ) - Hang on . - ( tires screeching ) ( panting , moans ) - ( Will ) You OK ? - Just a little cold . ( boy ) This your first time in the back seat , Will ? I 've been back here more times than I care to admit . ( groans ) Are you some sort of gangsta cop or somethin ' ? Old man 's police . Had my fair share of teenage rebellion , I guess . Never met my dad . He was shot before I was born . ( woman sings slow song on TV ) This girl , she 's really good . Her name 's Natalie . I watched her last week . She sings like a musical instrument . She uses a language of pure emotion . Yeah , yeah , she 's good . - She 's never gonna win . - Why ? Her eyes are too close together . She looks like a camel . ( Wolfgang ) Shut up . Camel 's never gonna win . Never . - ( low murmurs in audience ) - ( woman whispers ) Wolfgang . ( sings in German ) ( woman whispers ) Wolfgang . ( woman sings in German ) ( sighs ) ( laughs ) ( audience applauding on TV ) - ( sighs ) - Told you . ( sighs ) - ( cracking knuckles ) - ( exhales ) ( tires screeching ) ( boy panting ) Emergency ! Kid 's bleeding bad here . - That 's a gunshot . - Yeah , I know . - I 'm sorry , we can 't treat that here . - What ? Are you new ? You need to go and get an ambulance and take him to Mt . Sinai . The kid 's gonna be dead before we get there . - I 'm sorry . It 's policy . - What kind of policy lets a kid die ? We were losing so many resources to gunshots , we couldn 't take care of all the other patients that needed help around here . We 've been a better hospital since we stopped taking kids like him . - ( boy panting ) - ( Will ) Please . Please . ( watch beeping ) That 's it . Fuck . It 's over . Hey . ( soft clicking ) Shit . It 's Steiner ! We gotta go . Hey , Wolfgang . Please . He 's going to fucking kill us . I don 't want to die ! ( soft clicking continues ) ( clicking ) ( exhaling ) - You cracked the uncrackable . - ( sighs ) You did it . Yeah . OK . ( beeps ) ( grunts ) Dr. Manno just came out of surgery . Life signs are stable . He 'll probably make it . OK . Thanks . Can I ask you a personal question ? If he lives and he kills someone , let 's say a cop , how you gonna feel about that ? ( soft , mid-tempo music playing ) ( no audible dialogue ) ( music continues over headphones ) You all right ? You 're sweating . - Your pulse is racing . - I 'm fine . You 're scared . You needn 't be . You 're so beautiful . I don 't just mean in a physical way . The warmth ... pouring out of your heart . Even though you work hard to hide it . You don 't belong with these men . You know it 's true . Don 't you ? I used to be like you . Like an exposed nerve of a broken tooth . I used anything I could to insulate . Music ... books ... booze . Anything I could to keep myself separate from the rest of the world . Eventually I felt protected , you know , I ... I felt safe . But also ... I never felt so ... completely alone . Then one day a friend , she gave me a gift . She took away my armor . She tore down my walls . Her gift ... it reminded me what it felt like ... to be alive . What did she give you ? This . ( flicks lighter ) ( inhaling ) ( exhales , breathes deeply ) ( slow , ethereal music plays ) ( no audible dialogue ) - Stop the car . - Hm ? - I said stop the car ! - What the fuck ? This is where it happened . What happened ? It 's where she killed herself . ( mutters ) Shit . This is it . Ah , hell no . This wasn 't a dream . Of all the partners , I end up with a Mulder-wannabe . - D , a woman killed herself right here . - Where 's the blood , Will ? Maybe she only shot herself in the fifth dimension , so we can 't see the blood . OK , I 've never been here before . I know about this . Drugs . There 's a gun , too . There 's shit everywhere , man . Look , you 're freakin ' me out . Show me evidence of a crime , and you got me . So , until then , do your little séance , and I 'll be in the car . All right ? Uh ... Hi . This is where she died . Did you know her ? How do you know she died here ? I saw her . Do you live here ? Where do you live ? London . What are you doing here ? I don 't know . ( gasps ) I don 't know where I am . Chicago , near South Side . In America ? I 've never been to America . ( gasps ) Oh , no ! What are you doing ? - Don 't you fucking move ! - ( gasping ) ( screams ) - Stop . - Open the fucking safe ! Why are you doing this ? He has just had a shipment come in , and me and Nocker have been tracking ' it . We were gonna hit him yesterday , but he wanted you here . Up-bup-bup-bup-bup . Now , a smart guy like you ... probably has a gun in there . - ( gasps ) Don 't hurt him . - Oh , yeah . Is that why you came ? ' Cause you wanna ... Do you wanna fuck him ? ( sharp breath ) Riles , he will kill you without blinking if I didn 't have this . - I fuckin ' told you . Here . - I have to go . No , no , no , no , no . Riley . You 're not ... You 're not going anywhere . - You 're part of this . No , no , no . - ( panting ) Let me go . Riles , Riles ... this is the break that we 've been waiting for . Fill it up . Fill it up ! Riles , this is our chance . You said that you wanted to go to America . We wanted a different life . That 's ... That 's what you said , right ? - ( gasps ) - ( grunts ) ( gasping )

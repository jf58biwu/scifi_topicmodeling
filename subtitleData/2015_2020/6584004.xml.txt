 Previously in " the 100 " ... Let the people know they have a new commander . You don 't have the flame , ontari . - No one knows that . - He does . Is she really in there ? Of course she is . This is yours now , fleimkepa . Jaha : We need to increase the population in the city of light . The more minds turned to the task , the more powerful alle becomes and the closer we get to finding that second a.I. Bellamy : Pike just sentenced Lincoln and sinclair to death alongside Kane . We can save them , but we have to work together . You 're the reason they need saving . They 're searching the station . We need to go now . I love you . - No . - Just get her out of here . Pike : Lincoln of trikru , you have been sentenced to death in accordance with the exodus charter . - Any last words ? - Not for you . Where 's Lincoln ? Pike put a bullet in his brain . O. , o . , i am so sorry . Octavia , that 's enough . Kane , stay out of this . Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! That 's enough . Get out ! Bellamy : Miller , back up . Uh ! Aah ! - Uh ! - Uh ... You 're dead to me . How long is this gonna be necessary ? Roan said not to let you out of my sight until he got back . We 're on the 50th floor . Where am I gonna go ? Look . I 'm just saying a real commander - wouldn 't be afraid- - - i am a real commander . You gonna answer it ? Oh , so the king doesn 't think you can handle it , huh ? I thought you were in charge . I am . Whatever you say . Enter . Ontari : What is it , ambassador ? She will be there soon . Why are you in chains ? That is a good question . Where is master Titus ? Titus left to go find the next class of novitiates . The flame keeper has scouts for that . Yes . Well , the last crop the scouts brought back kind of sucked , didn 't they ? It 's better to lie your way out of a problem than kill . I saw your hand go for your sword . So ? So you can 't just go around killing your ambassadors . What did he want you to do ? Recite the lineage , the names of all past commanders . It marks the start of a new commander 's reign . And how you gonna do that ? Look . Maybe i can help you . How ? I think much better without a collar . " Prophet ! " Said I , " thing of evil ! " Prophet still if bird or devil ! " Whether tempter sent , " or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore , " desolate yet all undaunted , on this desert land enchanted . " On this home by horror haunted- - " tell me truly , I implore . " Is there--balm in gilead ? Whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed ... " Alie : I 'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by doing this . " Desolate yet all undaunted ... " Sensory overload can 't block me out . " Home by horror haunted- - tell me truly ... " I 'm in you now . " Is there- - balm in gilead ? " Tell me , tell me , i implore . " Tell me , tell me , I implore . Quoth the raven , " nevermore . " Will it work ? Of course not . " Prophet ! " Said I , " thing of evil ! " Prophet still if bird or devil ! Whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee ... " Raven : " Horror haunted- - tell me truly , I implore , is there- - balm in gilead ... " " Whether tempter sent , or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore- - " you were saying ? She 's so much stronger than the rest of you . Abby : Ok . Come on . Everyone out now . You , too , thelonious . This doesn 't concern you , Abby . Raven is with us now . That doesn 't sound creepy at all . We took away her pain , Jasper . We saved her , just like we can save you . Last chance before i call the guards and I have them move you away from my patient 's door . " Quoth the raven , " nevermore . " Uh ! Uh ! Ah ! I 'm back in . You 'll come around eventually . Not likely . Oh ... Raven , this is pointless . Sensory stimulation at the level required to force me out is unsustainable . Leave me alone ! Japser . Come in . Come on . Abby : Raven , what 's wrong ? I need your help to get this thing out of my head , and I think I know how to do it . Mom , what 's wrong ? Pike knows . Smile like i just made a joke . You need to go right now . Don 't pack . Don 't go back to your room . Find your friend . They 'll protect you . Did you tell pike ? Monty , you 're my son . I won 't lose both of the men I love . Can I hug you ? This can 't look like good-bye . Go . Bryan : I say we run two-man patrols around the clock , starting now . Kane : We 'll do that , but we should be safe here . The grounder blockade is too close for pike to--to risk looking for us . Yeah , but are we safe from the blockade ? As long as we stay this side of the line , we should be . They 're grounders . You really think they 're gonna play by the rules ? Miller : Hey , pike 'll want you dead now , too . We take him out , we can go home . Harper : We take him out , then the grounders lift the blockade . Kane : That 's right . We become the 13th clan again . Those were the terms . Lexa 's terms . If what bellamy says is true and she 's dead , how do we know the next commander will honor them ? One problem at a time . What about Clarke ? With lexa gone , she 's not safe in polls . Clarke made her choice . The only thing that matters now is killing pike . Octavia 's right . Once we resume our place in the commander 's coalition , Clarke will be safe , so how do we do it ? Monty , on radio : Bellamy , come in . It 's monty . I 'm in trouble . Please say you still have your radio . If we respond and pike 's listening- - bellamy : Go to channel 7 . " Please say you still have your radio . " That 's 7 words after the word " trouble . " It 's code . Go to 7 . Bellamy , are you there ? Monty , it 's Kane . What 's wrong ? Pike knows that i helped you get out . Can you get to the dropship ? I think so . Good . Go there . I 'll bring you in . Stay off the radio . Over and out . Hold on . What if it 's a trap and pike 's waiting ? That 's why I 'm going alone . Like hell you are . Miller : I 'm with octavia . Monty saved our lives . I 'm going , too . No , you 're not . If it is a trap , I 'm not marching our entire insurgency into it . To stop me , you 're gonna have to kill me . She hopes it 's a trap . He 's coming , too . We 'll need a hostage to trade for monty . It 's a good plan . He stays chained . Gag him . Miller : Sir , with all due respect- - he 's the enemy . Do what I said . Jaha : First , raven refuses to take back our machine , and now she 's looking for ways to leave us . I 'm telling you , doubt spreads like a virus . It 's not logical . According to the data , all human behavior revolves around the avoidance of pain . I offer an escape from suffering . Why would anyone resist this ? Logic has nothing to do with it . Free will is the problem . I told you , we have to get around it . Around it how ? Give raven back her pain . Remind her what life was like without you . You 're suggesting i coerce complicity . I 'm suggesting that once we give consent and take the key , we 're yours , tools to be used to accomplish our mission- - saving the human race by migrating what 's left of it to the city of light . In that way , we 're no different than the missiles you launched a hundred years ago . You hacked their programming . Now it 's time to hack ours . Override free will , starting with raven 's , and let 's finish what we started . Did you send the hundred to the ground wearing biometric wrist bands ? Yes . Why ? I 'm telling you , it will work . These wrist band were designed to transmit vital signs , electrical signals from the body . Abby : I designed them . I know how they work . Then you know they have a transponder . All we have to do is reverse it , and then we can send an energy pulse into my brain . If I 'm right , it will fry whatever alle put in there without damaging the tissue . What if you 're wrong ? If I was wrong , alle wouldn 't be looking at me right now like I stole her favorite toy . She 's here . You can see her ? Yeah . Why , raven ? With everything that i can do for you , why would you do this ? Because you stole my memories , you crazy bitch ! Are there any wrist bands left ? Jaha : I 'm not sure . We made more than we needed . It 's possible there could be a few still hanging around . Find them . Why ? She may have found a way to disconnect . Then we have no choice . The wrist bands , where are they ? - I don 't know . - I do . No . No . Everything I hear , she hears . Everything I see , she sees . Just--just tell him . Hey , we 're gonna fix you , all right ? Tell him to stay . Tell him you changed your mind . No ! No . Then I 'm sorry for this . No ! Aah ! Aah ! Oh ! Ah ! What 's wrong ? Raven , talk to me . Ok . Talk to me . You wanted your memories back . Here they are . Aah ! Aah ! No ! No ! Her heart 's racing . Look . We need to get her into medical . Ohh ! Aah ! Jackson , I need a reaper stick . No . Make it stop . Get it now . Uh ... Uh ... No ... No ! D 'aagh ! No ! Go get the wrist bands . Aah ! Uh ... What are you waiting for ? Go . Give her what she wants . Aah ! Uh ! She 's about to break . Abby : It 's ok . No ! No ! Aagh ! - Make it stop . - It 's ok , sweetheart . Ok . Jackson ! Uh ... No ! Alie : I can make it stop . I can lead you back to the city of light . Aagh ! All you have to do is submit . No ! No ! Aah ! I submit . Completely , raven , permanently . Aah ! Aah ! Ohh ! No ! Yes ! I submit ! Please ... Oh , please ... What the hell is wrong with you ? Aah ! Raven . I have full access to raven 's synaptic network . She is ours . Murphy : " Seek higher things . " Did you find it ? No , just a corporate motto . First commander went into space to seek higher things . Get it ? Heh , you know what ? Never mind . You said it would be here . Maybe I was wrong , ok ? I 'm guessing that to know the names of the dead commanders , you actually have to be one . You got to get the flame . You 're guessing ? The ambassadors are expecting me . I 'll have to kill them all now . That seems a bit excessive . I deserve this throne . I was raised for it , snatched from my parents by the queen of azgeda . I suffered her cruelty . I won the conclave . The ambassadors don 't get to judge me , and neither do you ! You 're right . You 're right . We don 't . No one does , and we can use that . What are you talking about ? Roan . He 's got you doing everything wrong . - You 're hiding . - I 'm not hiding . I 'm waiting for him to return with the flame . And what if he doesn 't ? The longer we wait , the harder it 's gonna be to convince the ambassadors that you 're the real thing . We ? I can help you sell this lie because- - like it or not , ontari- - a fake commander needs a fake flame keeper . I 'm listening . I 'm gonna need that case , Jasper . You can 't have it . Hey , get off me ! Get off me ! No ! Jaha , don 't do this . What are you doing ? Don 't do it . Oh ! No ! Kane : Monty ? We got here first . No , we didn 't . Hey , what are you doing ? Get outside now ! They followed me . I 'm sorry . Let him go , pike . Can 't do that . One at their feet . It 's over . Put down your weapons . Shoot him . Kane : Monty 's in the shot . Come on , Marcus . I promised monty 's mother that I 'd bring him home alive . Don 't make me a liar . Kane , no . Now you . What are you doing ? One in the girl 's leg . Uh ! Yaah ! Uh ! Octavia : Uh ! Ah ! You don 't look so good . I 'm fine . You got about 5 seconds to make me believe you 're still with me . All the others are in a cave not far from here . You son of a bitch ! Uh ! Give me the coordinates . I don 't have the coordinates , but I can take you there . You sure about the route ? We 're getting close to the blockade line . That 's why Kane set up out here . He didn 't think we 'd risk it . He was wrong . What 's gonna happen to my sister ? I know she has to answer for her crimes , but- - tell you what . I 'll make you the same promise i made to monty 's mother , immunity from all past actions , but if she screws up again- - oh , she won 't . I 'll make sure of it . My sister , my responsibility . Welcome back . Not you , too . Jackson : Abby , it 's a miracle . As doctors , it 's our job to relieve suffering . Shouldn 't you be- - what are your mother 's name , Jackson ? Mary Jackson died in her son 's arms after suffering a terrible illness . Who am I talking to ? It 's alle , right ? Mary 's death is the reason he became a doctor . She take that from you , too ? How is that a miracle ? All you have to do is swallow the key and see for yourself . That 's never gonna happen . He said you 'd say that . I want to talk to raven . Raven 's in the city of light . All you have to do to see- - I said no . Abby , you 've stopped us for too long . We need you to tell the people it 's safe . What we 're doing is too important . What you 're doing is stealing people 's minds . You 're wrong . We 're freeing their minds , and we won 't be done until everyone is with us . I don 't care if you torture me . I will never take the key . Who said anything about torture ? What are you doing ? Giving you a choice . No . No . No , no , no , no , no ! No ! Stop ! Stop ! No ! No , no ... Oh , god . Oh , god . Oh , god . Oh ... Oh ... Oh , god . If you want to save raven , all you have to do is take the key . Thelonious , please . If I don 't stop the bleeding , she 's gonna die . Her body will die , but her mind will live forever . Please ! Raven ... I 'm begging you , let me go to her . Open your mouth and hold out your tongue . Ontari : I am the last natblida , heir to bekka pramheda . I triumphed in the conclave , and you are my subjects . I am the last natblida , heir to bekka pramheda . I triumphed in the conclave , and you are my- - Murphy : Commander ... Ambassador usak demanded that he see you . Yes , but in the throne room , not here in this sacred space . This was his idea . I beg your pardon , ontari . Say my name again . Heda . Let me guess--you 'd like to hear the lineage . - Yes . - No . You reign cannot begin until you- - my reign has already begun . I am the last natblida , heir to bekka pramheda . I triumphed in the conclave , and you are my subjects . We will be your subjects after you recite the lineage . Is my flame keeper correct ? Did you demand to see me ? If you think you can intimidate--oh ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah aah aah aah ! Aah aah aah aah aah ! Aah ! Now you see me . We talked about restraint . You told me not to kill him . Well , next time , I 'll be more specific . Pike : Hold on . Now , the cave is just on the other side . Keep a sharp eye out . The blockade ! Anybody got eyes ? Back up . Back to higher ground . - Drop your weapon . - What the hell are you doing ? Drop your weapon ! We bring you chancellor pike of the sky people . O. , translate . You killed us all . Take him . Lift this blockade . Rrgh ! Aah ! No . Hey , no . No . The grounders are gonna need him alive . They didn 't get justice for Finn . We won 't get away with that again . In that case- - ugh ... Uh ... Where are you taking him ? To the new commander . May I join you ? We 're the 13th clan . Don 't slow us down . Are you sure ? We know nothing about the new commander . I 'm sure . Go home . Tell our people what happened here . Tell Abby I 'll look out for Clarke . Did you do this for your sister ... Or because it was the right thing to do ? You 're welcome . It matters . Until you see that ... You 'll still be lost . My mom turned me in . You 're family . You 'll work it out . Uh ... Heda . Heda . - Heda . - Heda . I 'm tired and hungry . No more meetings . Bring me wine . Oh , no , no , no . Easy there , big fella . It 's not necessary , right ? Put it on him . You- - leave us . Let me know the moment king roan returns . Heda . You want to explain this ? I don 't trust you . Hmm . Well , i got to say , I 'm a little hurt by that . How about now ? Now I 'm a little less hurt . Wait . There 's somebody else , ok ? I 'm sorry . Is she a commander , too ? No . Would she kill you if you ever lied to her ... Uh ! Did anything to break her trust or upset her in even the slightest way ? Mm ! Oh , the things i do to survive . Nngh ! Uh ! Rrgh ... Uh ! Oh ... Oh ... I took one myself . Everything that thelonious said is true . Jasper : Raven ! Raven , you 're not gonna bel- - what 'd they do to you ? They didn 't do anything . I 'm sorry if i frightened you today . I don 't understand . You were just begging us to get that thing out of your head . I was wrong . You can finally see for yourself . All you have to do is- - he 's taking raven . Come on . Find Jasper Jordan . Bring him here . Oh , god . That 's not good . Sorry about your paint job , raven . Jasper ? Clarke . Jasper , what 's going on ? Get in ! No . You don 't understand . I need to see Lincoln . You don 't understand . Lincoln is dead , and we will be , too , if you don 't get in now ! Why are they shooting ? I don 't know . What do you mean , Lincoln 's dead ? That can 't be . Suddenly you don 't understand what dead means ? I need him to take me to Luna . He 's the only one who knows where she- - shut up ! I don 't care , ok ? You really are the angel of death , aren 't you ? Come on . Come on . Come on . Yes ! Uh ! Uh ! Mom . As soon as raven wakes and I see her surroundings , we 'll find them . When we do , we 'll find the rest of their friends . Abby : Good . Now that arkadia has fallen , we 'll move on to stage two .

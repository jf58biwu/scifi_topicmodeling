 ( door opens ) KATHY : Hi , darlin ' . It 's me . I thought we 'd have , um , lunch together today . Oh , angel , you look sad . You know , it 's a very , very natural thing . It 's actually a very human thing to feel sad . But emotions aren 't bad . I 'm sorry , baby . I 'm still trying to get them to change their mind and let you out for a little bit . ( clattering ) - ( stabbing ) - Ah ! No ! Ah ! Get off ! ( alarm beeping ) No ! Ah ! Ah ! Oh , God ! TED : Morgan , Morgan . Calm ... Hey . Calm down , please . - Hey , Morgan . - ( Kathy whimpering ) It 's okay . ( suspenseful music playing ) ( beeping ) FEMALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE : Remote access brief for SynSect . Case number 681138 . Audio ID . Please identify . LEE : Lee Weathers . Risk Management . FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE : Access granted . Please stand by . JIM ( through speakers ) : Good day , Miss Weathers . Sorry for the short notice , but we really appreciate your urgent response on this . As you can see from the flash report , details are sketchy . We do know there was an incident involving the L-9 prototype at one of our off-site labs . Normally , we would send a security team , but given the extreme sensitivity of the L-series genetic research , we feel it best to exert a light touch here . We don 't want another Helsinki . Keep the project staff on-site and make your assessment following the psych eval . Dr. Ben Shapiro from psych tech will join you to interview the subject . SynSect has invested significant capital in the L-series product , and , well , let 's just say these folks have been holed up for quite a while . SECURITY GUARD ( on speaker ) : Shortleaf . Lee Weathers . I 'm expected . JIM ( through speakers ) : The faculty are a close-knit group , so it 's very possible they 've drifted off the original project brief . Update me following initial contact . LEE : Confirmed . Delete file . ( cell phone whirs ) ( birds chirping ) TED : Miss Weathers . Ted Brenner . I 'm the Project Manager . We spoke online . Nice to meet you . Let me help you with your luggage . TED : Did you find the place okay ? LEE : I did . I don 't know if you 've already been informed , but we just got word that Dr. Shapiro has been detained . Yes , I 've been informed . It 's unfortunate , I know . He should be here early tomorrow morning , so , if you don 't mind waiting ... I guess I don 't really have much of a choice . This way , please . You have your own bathroom with a shower . Hot water is ample here . I 'd be happy to give you a tour of the facilities if you 'd like . I 'd actually like to meet with Dr. Cheng and Dr. Ziegler . Absolutely . They 're eager to meet you . And Kathy Grieff . Kathy ... Uh , I haven 't checked in - on her today , but ... - Well , as soon as you do , let her know I 'd like to see her . TED : Of course . And Morgan . As soon as possible . I will be sure to let Dr. Ziegler know . I think you 'll see the results of our investment , despite the current setbacks , are quite remarkable . Thank you , Ted . Yes . This is Lee . ( shower running ) JIM ( on phone ) : You 're clear to get started . This is not just about the L-9 . Someone has really screwed up . Use today to take a closer look at the team . Of course . After Shapiro 's analysis tomorrow , I 'll have a more complete picture . I also hope to see Morgan today . I may need to press the issue . JIM : Be cautious , Miss Weathers . Make sure all safety protocols are in place . But above all , preserve the asset . To confirm , I 'm acting on your full authority ? JIM : Absolutely , Miss Weathers . Good . ( faint thud ) - AMY : Hi . - Hi . I 'm Amy . Ah , the behaviourist . That 's right . I just reviewed your paper on CNT in hybridized neuro-tech , and it was very impressive . Oh , thank you . But , I mean ... ( scoffs ) That was an old paper . I can 't even remember what I wrote . You seem to have managed to put a lot of it into practice . Oh , I 'll take your word for it . You know , you 're nowhere near as scary as I imagined . I 'd love to chat more , but I 'm just in the middle of getting settled . Oh , I 'll get out of your hair . Boundary issues , right ? Is that what it says in my file ? - Something like that . - Yeah . You probably know more about me than I do . - I wouldn 't say that . - ( scoffs softly ) Look , I get it . Okay , you have a job to do , just like everybody else here . Look , if you ever need anything from me , don 't hesitate to ask . I appreciate that . Thank you . They tell you dinner 's at 8 : 00 ? - Mm-hmm . - Skip 's making a lasagna . ( chuckles ) Everybody loves lasagna , right ? Right . - ( jazz music playing ) - ( Skip humming ) Oh , hey , there . You 're Skip . Right . You 're , um ... The consultant from , uh , Corporate . Well , I am the nutritionist and general kitchen monkey , so if you need anything , let me know . Do you need anything ? Water ? Uh , beer ? Maybe a protein shake ? No . I 'm good . Thank you . Oh , my glorious contribution to science . Ah . LEE : You hunt ? Oh , yeah . We 're farm fresh around here . I 'm not a half bad shot . TED : Ah , there you are . - I see you 've met Skip . - I have . Well , Dr. Ziegler is just finishing up a spot of work . But I thought we might pop in on Kathy . Nice to meet you . Kathy , Brenda , this is Lee Weathers from Corporate . Dr. Finch . Kathy , I 'd love to have a chat . KATHY : Oh . I 'm up for anything . I told Bren , I told the doc . Hell , I told everybody . I don 't need to be in this God damn bed . But nobody seems to want to listen to me , so ... She 's just been medicated . LEE : I 'd like to speak with her in private . BRENDA : She needs her rest . It won 't take too long . KATHY ( weakly ) : It 's fine . We 'll be right outside . ( groaning ) ( sighs ) ( door closes ) How are you feeling ? I look worse than I feel . I can promise you that . Look , this wasn 't Morgan 's fault . It was my fault . Really . ( sighs ) I was , like ... Careless . She was in a mood . The company doesn 't have to worry about me . Really . We are worried . Any time an employee is in danger . No , no , I don 't ... That 's not ... I mean , it was my mistake . Huh ? I ... I shouldn 't have confused her . Morgan 's not a " she . " It 's an " it . " Oh , you 're wrong about that , Miss Weathers . She 's smart . She 's smarter than any of us . But that 's not what makes Morgan special . There was joy in her heart before we shoved her back in that box . You haven 't met her ? Not yet . You 'll see . You will . You really will . Nothing here is a foregone conclusion . I 'm just looking for some answers . Some information . You 're a liar . There 's a smile on your face , but ... I can tell what you are . You 're a God damned assassin . Get better soon . No , no . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . It 's these lousy drugs . I 'm not myself . She 's a good girl . She just got it all mixed up , just for a moment . It can happen to anyone . It can . Feel better . - ( groans ) - ( door closes ) ( birds chirping ) ( knocking on door ) - TED : Dr. Ziegler . - Oh . Miss Weathers . Pleasure . Yes , absolutely . ( chuckles ) It 's unfortunate your stay here has been needlessly extended . That 's okay , doctor . We 'll adjust . Why don 't you get me up to speed ? Yes . Uh , please . SIMON : The creation of synthetic DNA was the relatively simple half of the equation . The second half is where it gets a little more tricky . Like a magician , we tricked the neural network into accepting our nano into its ranks , to alight in its midst . Then during the incubation period , the nano begins to introduce its own language , its own commands . The growth rate of the organism gradually accelerates as it reacts to and reproduces the new stimuli . Yes , I have read the material , doctor . Yes . Of course . Well , as you know , uh , Morgan was our third attempt . Our first full-term subject developed internal features externally . BRENDA ( on video ) : It 's not working . It 's dropping . SIMON : It expired not long after its so-called birth . BRENDA ( on video ) : No . SIMON : And then the second ... Well , it exhibited more complete physical growth , but it was plagued by mental issues in its development . This only strengthened our decision to start with a more emotionally cognitive specimen . Then , after two years , we finally had our ... - Our little breakthrough . - ( baby cries ) LUI ( on video ) : Yes ! - Hi . - ( EKG beeping ) ( baby cooing ) SIMON : We knew right away that Morgan was very special . Very alert , very responsive . You are ! SIMON : Her intelligence grew steadily . Advanced comprehension , growth rate . AMY ( on video ) : Are you ready ? SIMON : Within a month , walking and talking . She was exactly what we intended , - a hybrid biological organism ... - ( giggling ) ... with the capacity for autonomous decision-making and sophisticated emotional responses . AMY : No , Morgan . Come back ! - ( Amy shrieks and laughs ) - ( Morgan giggles ) AMY : I 'm gonna get you . - I 'm gonna get you ! - ( Morgan giggling ) - Morgan , look over here . - Oh ! Look at this ! Do you see ? What 's that ? ( Amy gasps ) I got three . Isn 't it amazing ? Like a nice little ... - ( chuckles ) - ( clicking mouse ) - ALL : Hooray ! ( flapping ) It 's her first birth ... ( sniffs ) Its first birthday . It exceeded our ... Our wildest expectations . TED : A great day . Special day . I 'd like to discuss the incident , if that 's okay . - ( woman laughs in video ) - ( clicks mouse ) Yes . What would you like to know ? I 'm still unclear on the cause . Yes . - There had been some debate ... - ( clicks ) ... on Morgan 's time outside . Something she clearly loved . When the excursions with Amy were postponed , she may well have overreacted . - ( clattering ) - ( Kathy screams ) SIMON : I believe Amy 's use of eco-therapy was wonderful for Morgan . Cheng believed Morgan was introduced to this kind of stimuli at too young an age . ( Kathy crying ) TED ( on video ) : It 's okay . Hey , that 's it , Morgan . Hey , hey . It 's okay . Hey . - KATHY ( screams ) : No ! - ( tranquilizer fires ) It 's very unfortunate . DARREN ( on video ) : Put your head back . SIMON : But we have the opportunity to learn from this . We can condition Morgan 's behavior . Teach it about action and consequence . No ... ( stutters ) I think that despite these obvious setbacks , this project is heading in the right direction . DARREN ( on video ) : It 's okay , it 's okay . KATHY ( on video ) : No . ( groaning ) Morgan . I , uh , want you to see how special she is . We 've been working hard , modifying command cues , and with the psych evaluation tomorrow , I ... I prefer your time with her now be brief . Darren . - ( opera music playing ) - Darren . - Darren . - Hey ! Hey . Lee Weathers , from Corporate . Yeah . Right . Corporate . - Hello . Welcome . - LEE : Hello . How 's she doing ? DARREN : Uh , you know , she 's okay . ( opera music continues playing ) What 's with the music ? Hmm ? Oh , Morgan finds it relaxing . SIMON : She likes different kinds of music . Jazz , classical . She 's been quite taken with opera of late . Uh , Lee wants to say hello . Can you get Morgan to shut the music down ? - ( button clicks ) - Hey , Morgan , buddy . DARREN : Can you turn the music down for a few ? We 've got somebody here we 'd like you to meet , okay ? ( opera music stops ) SIMON : Oh , uh , we 've configured the room . Morgan 's learning to control some aspects of her environment without an intermediary . Hello , Morgan . Hello , Lee . You know who I am ? MORGAN : Yes . Of course . You 're Lee Weathers . Risk Management Consultant at SynSect . And why I 'm here ? To assess my viability as a potential product stream ... In light of recent events . That 's right . How are you feeling , Morgan ? I 'm feeling not quite myself . Morgan 's been quite upset about Kathy . I didn 't mean to hurt her . Kathy is a very sweet person . I would never wanna do anything to hurt her . It was an error of judgment . I made a mistake . SIMON : But it 's okay now , Morgan . It 's all right . I did not mean to be rude . How are you feeling , Lee ? I 'm okay . I 'm all right . Thank you for asking . Would you like to talk about what happened ? TED : We 're actually going to save the psych evaluation for tomorrow , Morgan . Are we all good here , Lee ? - We 're good . - ( Simon sighs ) Get a good night 's sleep , Morgan . MORGAN : Yes . Thank you , Dr. Ziegler . I should get a good night 's sleep . I do feel terribly about it all . Everything that 's happened . We 'll talk about it tomorrow . Yes . Tomorrow . Nice to meet you , Morgan . Nice to meet you , Lee . ( door closes ) You 're not even gonna say it ? Say what ? That you 're impressed ? Is that what you need me to say ? That I 'm impressed ? ( birds chirping ) MORGAN : Are we allowed to be here ? AMY : It 's okay . This can be our little secret . ( birds chirping ) AMY : See , this is a pine tree . And , you know , some of them can live for thousands of years . Thousands of years ? AMY : Yeah . It 's pretty cool , isn 't it ? - ( water running ) wasps ) Morgan , I 'm so proud of you . Why ? Because you 're learning how to be yourself . And that 's the most important thing . ( breathes deeply ) That was delicious . Thanks . What , you showing off for the new girl ? BRENDA : So what does that mean , exactly ? " Risk Management Consultant " ? Pretty much how it sounds . Most corporations employ a certain amount of risk and I assess that risk against anticipated profit . Of course . ( inhales audibly ) Anticipated profit . So , did you two meet on the job ? - ( clears throat ) - We did . Close quarters makes for strange bedfellows , I guess . It 's funny , but in a weird way , Morgan really brought us together . She 's almost like a child to us . Isn 't that right , babe ? - Absolutely . - BRENDA : Mmm . DARREN : You know . You met her today . Saw how special she is . BRENDA : And that 's just the thing . You see , it is so easy to forget that Morgan is only five years old . She is an innocent and she 's learning , and she has the right to make mistakes . She has no rights , whatsoever . - ( utensils clanging ) - ( Ted clears throat ) TED : Yes . Well , we 've been living here for seven years . As you can imagine , it 's difficult to avoid gender . " She " , " it " , whatever ... So you assess this whole anticipated profit thing . And then what ? Then I make my recommendation to Corporate . You 'll have to forgive Amy 's curiosity . TED : Dr. Cheng , may I present Miss Weathers . It 's a pleasure to finally meet you . Have we not met before ? I don 't think so . I 'm sure I would have remembered . SIMON : So glad you could join us . Thank you . So , Miss Weathers ... I imagine that Corporate has granted you unreserved authority here . I hope we are able to assist you in coming to a fair conclusion . Thank you I have an enormous amount of respect for your work , Dr. Cheng And your judgment ( speaking Mandarin ) Were you in Helsinki for long ? ( speaking English ) Not until after . I was with recovery . LEE : I 'm sure it was very difficult for you . ( Lui speaking Mandarin ) No account could do it justice We had a team of thirty people on that project It took only an hour for thirty to become nine LUI ( speaking English ) : I have learned a hard lesson here . For every decision we make , there are consequences . SIMON : Well , this is not Helsinki , Dr. Cheng . Those were crude prototypes . Morgan is much more advanced . So much more than the company could ever expect . I hope that you are correct . ( chuckles softly ) ( clears throat ) LEE : Why did you end Morgan 's eco-therapy sessions with Amy ? There was an incident in the woods . Amy took Morgan beyond the property lines . It could have compromised the entire project . That was my excuse . But the truth ... ( inhales deeply ) Do you know the cruelest thing you can do to someone you 've locked in a room ? Press their face to the window . You know what you must do . ( faint , indistinct chatter ) ANN : All right . I want you to watch this . BRENDA : Okay . AMY : So , do that weird one he sings ... Shimmy , shimmy cocoa pop Cherry on the top MORGAN : Okay . AMY AND MORGAN : He goes down , down , baby Down by the roller coaster Sweet , sweet baby Sweet , sweet , don 't let me go Shimmy , shimmy , cocoa pop Shimmy , shimmy , rock Ice cream , soda pop Vanilla on the top And then sock you in the stomach three more times . - ( Morgan laughing ) - How did you beat me ? AMY : You 're so good ! TED : Wonderful ! AMY : Baby , you 're so good . You picked that up so fast ! - Can we do it again ? - AMY : Did you guys get that ? - ( Ted laughing ) - Can we do it again ? ( melancholic music playing ) ( clicking mouse ) ( beeping ) ( taps keyboard ) ( soft music playing ) Uh-oh . You , too , huh ? You working late ? Mmm . It 's peaceful out here . SKIP : Yeah , out here . Brenda and Darren are going at it pretty good in the room next to mine . It 's a nice old house , but the walls are thin . Can I get you a drink ? - Please . - ( cork popping ) So , you , uh , enjoy the corporate life ? It 's fine . SKIP : Yeah ? You been there long ? Awhile . Is that what you wanted to be when you grew up ? A Risk Management Consultant ? ( chuckles ) Oh , you 're kind of an over-sharer , huh ? So , did Darren and Brenda , did they pair up early ? Pretty early , I guess . After he got tired of chasing after Amy . She 's interesting . SKIP : Interesting is a word to describe her . Sure . You , too ? Me , too ? No . No , not really . ( chuckles ) Yeah , we fooled around a bit when we first got up here . You know , it 's ... It happens . - We don 't ... - I don 't ... I don 't mean to pry . I 'm just trying to figure out how things work around here . SKIP : Right . LEE : No , we 're just two people having a conversation . There 's nothing wrong with that . SKIP : Right , I understand . Uh , me and Amy . I guess we were the only two to pick up on the distinct summer camp vibe when we first made bunk . But I really don 't think I 'm her type . - ( tapping keys ) - ( beeping ) - AMY : Hey , Ted . - Hey . How 's she doing ? She 's a little unsettled tonight . Right . What do you make of Miss Weathers ? Oh , you know me , Ted . I hate just about everybody . ( mouse clicking ) AMY : Morgan . Morgan . LEE : How do you feel about Morgan ? Honestly ? We 're one big happy family up here and all that , but the thing has always given me the creeps . You 're the only one I 've heard say that . That may be true , but , you know , I 'm not a scientist , and maybe I 'm just a little jealous . - Jealous ? - Maybe . But why ? ( chuckles ) It made a perfect risotto . - ( chuckles ) - Made it like it was nothing . They say you have to cook with your heart and your soul and all that stuff , but it just made the most perfect risotto . ( chuckles ) - Hmm . - ( softly ) I 'm sorry . Oh , God . ( sighs ) That is on me . Uh ... If you ... If you knew how long I 've been up here in the middle of nowhere , flipping grilled cheese for these guys and cutting the crusts off for C-3PO , it 's ... ( sighing ) Have a good night , Skip . All right . ( chuckles ) ( door opens ) - ( door closes ) - ( exhales ) That was , uh ... Well played , Skip . Well played . AMY : I wanted to talk to you before tomorrow . You 'll do fine , Morgan . You Will . Just be yourself . Okay ? Yes . I suppose that 's the only thing I can be . Tell me again . About the lake . You remembered . ( both sigh ) I 'm going to take you to Lake Navar . It 's not too far from where we are now . It is the most beautiful lake you will ever see . And if we 're quiet , you can hear just the smallest whisper of wind through the trees . It 's our own paradise , Morgan . It 's just like heaven . ( Morgan breathes heavily ) How old is it ? I think it 's about as old as the universe . - ( rustling ) - ( gasps ) ( whispers ) It 's a deer . Morgan , don 't scare it . ( whimpering faintly ) MORGAN : Is it hurt ? ( deer snorting ) ( bones crack ) ( wind blowing ) ( suspenseful music playing ) ( beeps ) ( gate opening ) AMY : This doctor , he a friend of yours ? No . Why ? ( car door opens , closes ) I don 't think I like him too much . Good to know . They say I can 't be there for the psych eval . Apparently , I didn 't clear for essential personnel . SHAPIRO : I 've reviewed the files . Seems fairly straightforward , no ? Well , you may find this is not your garden variety evaluation . Morgan is an exceptionally complex specimen . Well , it 's a God damn microwave , as far as I 'm concerned . It 's not gonna change how I do my job . It 's a standard long form psych eval for fourth wave A.I. Well , she 's not a microwave , and you 'd do well to remember that . Uh , this is my job , doctor . It 's a job I happen to be very good at . If you have a problem with my methodology or a lack of faith in my abilities , well , I suggest you take that up with Corporate . - TED : Dr. Shapiro . - Yes ? This is Lee Weathers . Glad to see you finally arrived . Trust everything 's okay ? Yes . I ... I 've apologized for the delay . I got caught up in Utah , - a personal matter . - Not a problem . We 're behind schedule . Will you need to review the background ? No , not necessary . I can dive right in . I need to be out of here as soon as possible . Okay . Let 's get started then . - This way , please . - SHAPIRO : Mm-hmm . ( footsteps approaching ) ( sighs ) You want me to sit here ? ( scoffs ) Is this some kind of a joke ? Uh , just ... In light of recent events , I think we 'd all feel a lot more comfortable with a high safety protocol . Comfortable , right . Well , Ted , in my experience , comfort can be a thorn in the side of revelation . Of course . Yes , but ... It 's my job to build trust with the subject . It 's just gonna be a little hard with a pane of glass between us , you know ? ( chuckles ) TED : It 's really just , uh , to ensure your safety , doctor . SHAPIRO : Mm-hmm . What did I miss in the brief ? What , does this thing shoot laser beams out of its eyes or something ? ( chuckles ) SIMON : Well , for one , there 's her emergent precognition . What you don 't understand is the ... The reach of her intelligence . Doctor , all due respect , you need me sitting on the other side of the glass from this thing , then I think it 's safe to say that it has already failed the psych evaluation . Good . ( door closes ) Hello , Morgan . Hello , Dr. Shapiro . You know my name . Yes . And you know why I 'm here ? Yes . Great . Then we can dive right in . That sound okay ? Yes . There 's no right or wrong answers here , Morgan . This is just us having a conversation . Hmm ? Just me and you getting to know each other . Me getting to know you , especially . So you just , uh ... Be yourself . Okay ? Okay . Okay . All righty . Yeah . I was ... I was reading in the report that you 've been feeling a little sad . You feeling a little sad , Morgan ? Yes . Why are you feeling sad ? I 'm sad about Kathy . Kathy Grieff ? - Yes . - Mm-hmm . Can you tell me what you did ? I stabbed Kathy in the eye . It was an error . I shouldn 't have done it . Mmm . Feeling sad is the correct response . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And , uh ... What would we call , um , an incorrect response ? Laughter . Yeah , sure . Laughter would be an incorrect response , yeah . What makes you laugh , Morgan ? I don 't have a very good sense of humor . ( laughs ) That 's okay . People tell me the same thing , so ... Do you consider yourself a person , Morgan ? No . I am something new . There is no appropriate label . Do you think it 's safe to say - that your consciousness is superior ? - No . It 's just different . Apples and oranges , huh ? ( chuckles ) It 's a saying . It means that , uh ... You 're different from human beings the way that apples are different from oranges . Yes . Of course . - I am apples and oranges . - Mmm . Forgive me , I occasionally struggle with metaphor . Do you like it here , Morgan ? Yes . What do you like about it ? MORGAN : I like my music . I like my friends . Who are your friends ? Darren is my friend . Brenda is my friend . Amy is my friend ... Ah , they 're your friends , right . But do you think they treat you like a friend ? Do you ? I mean , you think it 's normal for friends to lock each other in cages ? - I was not always in a cage . - No ? Before the incident , I was free to come and go as I pleased . Well ... I was reading in the notes , in regard to the incident with Kathy , that , uh , there was , in fact , uh , some disagreement on that matter the day before . Could you look at me , please , Morgan ? I was meant to go to the lake with Amy . Oh . Go to the lake with Amy . I see . That sounds like fun . No wonder you were upset . I was not upset . There was an error . ( thumps ) An error ? Like the error that occurred with Kathy ? I love Kathy . You experience love ? I have the ability to demonstrate love . SHAPIRO : Okay . So you can demonstrate love and sadness . How do you express other emotions ? What other emotions ? SHAPIRO : Oh , I don 't know . Fear ? ( both panting ) Anger ? ( chuckles ) You 're a father , aren 't you ? You have a 13-year-old daughter . You don 't get to see her much anymore . ( chuckles ) Yeah , uh ... I , uh ... lam a father . Mm-hmm . So , what ... ( chuckles ) What am I supposed to understand here , Morgan ? What am I missing ? I 'm a child . SHAPIRO : You 're a child . ( chuckles ) Yeah . That 's true . You 're a child . Uh , you 're only five years old . ( chuckles ) What emotion do you think you were expressing with Kathy , Morgan ? - I love Kathy . - SHAPIRO : Mmm . What about me ? Do you love me ? - No . - No ? Oh , that hurts my feelings a little bit . But you know what ? I get it . I get it . You just met me . But , you know , you might grow to love me . Yeah . If , say , I recommended that you be allowed to go to the lake . With Amy . Would you love me then ? I don 't know . SHAPIRO : Hmm . What if I made a different recommendation ? What if I recommended that you should not be allowed to leave this room ? My feelings are irrelevant . If that is the recommendation ... SHAPIRO : Mmm . Okay . What if I made the recommendation that you not be able to leave this room and you not be able to listen to your music and you not be able to see your friends ? What if I recommended that you be terminated ? Huh ? ( breathing shakily ) ( chuckles ) Okay . All right . Forget that . Okay ? Forget it . Let 's say ... Let 's say I do the opposite , okay ? What if I recommend that you be allowed to go to the lake and then I drive you there myself ? Yeah . Then , it would be only natural you 'd have warmer feelings for me . Feelings like you might have for , uh , Amy or for any of your friends here . Maybe even feelings like love . I suppose.I ... I don 't know . It 's a hypothetical situation . SHAPIRO : Exactly . So , hypothetically , what would you do if I recommended that you be terminated ? What would you do , hypothetically ? - I don 't know . - Come on . You don 't know ? - No . - Off the top of your head . Come on ! - I don 't know . - No right or wrong answer . - I don 't know ! ( sobs ) - Come on ! Come on ! Answer me . What would you do ? - I don 't know . - ( yelling ) What would you do ? We should end this . SHAPIRO : Show me , if you can 't tell me . Demonstrate it for me . That 's it . What is that ? I don 't know what that is . What is that showing me ? Show me ! Show me ! I don 't know what this is . What is that ? ( yelling ) Show me how you feel ! Show me how you feel ! - ( grunting panting ) - Morgan ! Tranquilizers ! Go ! - ( Shapiro screaming ) - SIMON : Now ! ( Shapiro screaming ) ( groaning ) SIMON : Brenda . Get Brenda . Go ! ( groaning , gurgling ) DARREN ( nervously ) : Shit . Shit . ( groaning ) SIMON : Morgan ! No . What the fuck ? Shit ! ( beeps ) - ( door opens ) - Morgan . Buddy . I need you to chill the fuck out , okay ? DARREN : Fuck . Fuck . ( both grunting ) ( Darren panting ) - ( grunts , groans ) - Morgan . ( Darren panting ) ( alarm blaring ) ( coughs ) ( panting ) Morgan ? - ( tranquilizer fires ) - ( Morgan grunts ) Morgan ? AMY : Morgan , look at me . Morgan . Baby ( breathing heavily ) ( breathes heavily ) What happened ? Please . Try to relax , Morgan . Darren , did I hurt him ? No . I 'm okay , buddy . I 'm right here , okay ? I didn 't mean to do it . DARREN : Hey , I know . I know . I can 't move my arms . LUI : You 've been restrained . Morgan . We have decided on a plan of action . One that is best for you . Best ... Best for me ? SIMON : Oh , my God . What are we doing ? We need to inform Corporate immediately , Dr. Ziegler . LEE : I 've taken the liberty . A containment crew will be here at daybreak to collect the specimen and any other data for analysis . No , that 's not gonna work . Uh , no one else can handle this kind of material . ( chuckles softly ) Uh , it 's more effective if we process the data here . I 'm sorry , doctor . There 's no other work to be done here . SIMON : But it 's our work . Our lives invested in this . We 've created new life and you want us to just throw that away ? LUI : Enough . ( whispers ) We 've failed , Simon . There 's no reason to labor the point . Cheng ... Go back to the house . You don 't need to be here . ( chuckles ) Right . And allow you to do what ? To destroy years of work ? Go back to the house . Pour yourself a drink . If that 's what you think is best . ( sighs ) BRENDA : Sodium thiopental . ( inhales sharply ) Five milliliters to sedate . MORGAN : What are you doing ? Then , 30 milliliters of dihydromorphinone . Have I disappointed you , mother ? Have I failed ? I always do my best . I do everything you ask , Ted . Amy . Amy ! - ( Darren shushing ) - MORGAN : No . No . ( sobbing ) No ! I promise I 'll do better . - I 'll do whatever you want . - DARREN : Take it easy . - ( sobbing ) No , no ! - DARREN : Just relax . Relax . LUI : It is time to go to sleep , Morgan . - MORGAN : No ! - DARREN : It 's gonna be okay , buddy . MORGAN : No . ( sobbing ) - ( Darren shushing ) - I don 't wanna die ! Please , mother . - LUI : This Will help . - MORGAN : No ! LUI : You won 't feel any more pain . MORGAN : No ! Don 't ! ( Morgan sobbing ) I wanna live . Please , mother . I 'm not your mother , Morgan . You have no mother . ( breathing heavily ) I have no mother . I 'm sorry . We have failed you . Make it quick . ( door closes ) ( Young Morgan giggling ) AMY : Morgan ! I 'm gonna get you ! ( giggles ) I 'm gonna get you .

But it 's because of that professionalism that I think you should understand and appreciate our course of action here . ( panting ) Let me out . Now . I 'm sorry , Lee . I can 't do that . ( breathing heavily ) They 're gonna be here . Your friends over at Corporate are gonna be here sooner than you think . We 're all gonna have a nice little chat about everything . Of course . You get some rest now . I understand how you feel about Morgan . How much you care for her . Ted , it needs to be terminated . ( sighing ) TED : She 's angry . Well , of course she 's angry . Can 't worry about that now . We 're past that . How close are we ?

Open the door and let me help you . I don 't need your help . I 'm starting to feel like myself . Do you feel like yourself , Lee ? Or do you feel like something else ? I know why they made me .

Get in the car . ( whimpering ) I have to go say goodbye to mother . ( yells ) LUI : This is Dr. Lui Cheng . Technical Director of the L-9 Morgan program . It pains me to report an accident that occurred during the scheduled psychological evaluation of Morgan . We had anticipated that , by developing a model that was more self-aware , more autonomous , and more human , we could teach it to be the best of what we are . ( birds chirping ) Our intent was to demonstrate to you , to the SynSect board , that a more refined and peaceful synthetic life-form is possible . Morgan ? Baby ( both grunting ) ( groaning ) Darren . LUI : Despite our attempts to promote a natural , emotional intelligence , Morgan has been unable to move beyond its weaponized design parameters . ( choking ) Ah ! ( Kathy choking ) Shit . Fuck . ( panting ) ( choking ) ( grunts ) SKIP : Lee ! Listen to me . Listen , You can 't go in there . ( panting ) Morgan 's gone ... She 's gone postal . This is what I do , Skip . Go get your rifle . Confirmation of program collapse . LUI : Morgan is no longer viable . Mother . All right . Implementation of loss protocol in action . ( door opens ) I have come to say goodbye You should have told me , Mother What I truly was What I would become . ( speaking Mandarin ) I 'm sorry Now you know exactly who you are ( footsteps approaching ) ( grunts ) ( choking ) ( sobbing ) SKIP : Amy . Hey , get out of the car . Amy , get out of the car .

We need to leave . Whoa . What happened to Amy ? I 'm sorry , Skip . Just wait a second . Lee ... ( birds chirping ) JIM : She did very well . Agreed , the situation is untidy , but given the unpredictable nature of the assignment , she prosecuted her mandate perfectly . She was measured and surgical , even when the situation was considerably less so . Most importantly , she followed her directives without hesitation . The collateral damage was regrettable , of course . But in this case , unavoidable . I think these events make it punishingly clear what I had already predicted . The L-9 was the inferior program . Though its emotional development was certainly remarkable , the immediate termination was an unfortunate but clear necessity . Well , I guess the old dogs hunt the best , sir . Then it 's settled . We stick to what we know . All development assets revert to the L-4 stream . GRIMES : So what do we do about Lee Weathers ? JIM : What about her ? She 's perfect . ( " Very Cruel " playing ) That 's the song that I knew when I was young About the tall trees In Georgia If you love all men Then you 'll be left With none Don 't you see That 's what you 've done ? Now the world How it burns as it turns You 've been taught Oh , but you 've never learned Just forget yourself And forget it hurts Cut it off If it gets too fierce What it 'd be like In the willows with you We 'd be free Like we used to What does that even mean ? It means we 'd want nothing But to be a good choice To choose You 're a good choice To choose When the applause dies And our hands are untied Will you believe me That I love you ? What a fool I 've been To beg you again and again To believe me That I want you And now we both can 't sleep I see you in my dreams There you are on The lonely screen What it 'd be like In the willows with you We 'd be free Like we used to What does that even mean ? It means we 'd want nothing But to be a good choice To choose What it 'd be like In the willows with you We 'd be free Like we used to What does that even mean ? It means we 'd want nothing But to be a good choice To choose You 're a good choice To choose You 're so very cruel You 're so you 're so You 're so very cruel You 're so you 're so You 're so very cruel You 're so you 're so You 're so very cruel You 're so you 're so You 're so very cruel You 're so , you 're so You 're so very cruel You 're so , you 're so You 're so very cruel You 're so , you 're so You 're so very cruel ( soft instrumental music playing ) .srt Synced Corrected by Dan4Jem , XII.MMXVI

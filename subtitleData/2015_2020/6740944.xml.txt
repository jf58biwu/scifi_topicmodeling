 It 's coming ! Get ready ! Go , man , go ! Aah ! Damn it ! Damn it ! Engine 's dead ! Get it . Kill it ! Shoot anything that moves . Help . He ... He got me . He 'll kill us all . Give me that damn thing . Get back ! Shoot it ! Shoot it now ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No , please ! No ! 4x01 - " The Ghost " You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive . Hmm . That 's funny . 'Cause I thought I would just ... Mm . Yeah , that 's one way to go . Want a beer ? It 's 6 : 00 in the morning . What , are you Hemingway ? No , is that real ? When did we cross the North Pole ? An hour ago . Oh , my gosh . It 's hard to keep track in this thing . We shouldn 't have to stay on clock when we 're moving through time zones . I mean , what is that ... three continents in two days ? If you count Berlin . We were only there three hours . Yeah , we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment , saw that bong . - I could smell it from the hallway . - Jokers . Hungry for attention . And potato chips . If the munchies was a superpower , they 'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak . You should let me work on Lola . I warned you . Everything in Lola is custom . Yeah , yeah , everything is custom . But it would be something to do . There 's only so many times a guy can win cash off you ... sir . You got to stop calling me that . - We 're being called back to H.Q. - They say why ? We 're not due for a restock for another 10 days . - No idea . They said it 's classified . - Oh , everything is nowadays . All right , we 'll need full inventory . Medical , provisions , fuel cells , and make sure you tell the crew they 'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment . Agent Thompson ... - Wonder what that 's about . - Oh , I don 't know . - It 'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons . - And May . Yeah ... I think you look forward to that more than I do . Hyah ! What was his mistake ? You know I 'm not gonna talk . He didn 't anticipate your back kick . Opened himself up . His mistake was he tapped out . - Piper . - Okay , people ! What , you never seen the biggest plane ever built before ? ! Next pairing , on the mat ! - How long has it been ? - Six weeks in the air . Only the Quinjet touched down . - Is that a record for Zephyr One ? - It is . It was supposed to be even longer . - You know who called us in ? - I do . You ? Okay . Now I know something 's up . I got word from contacts in law enforcement , Los Angeles . Two civilians were violently killed . Mysterious burns , heads bashed in , spine pulled out of his ... Wow . Many conflicting accounts , but all agree ... it was odd . Odd ? Isn 't that our wheelhouse ? He 's right . Why call us in ? We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person , - if there is one . - If it checks out , we bag and tag . We handle these on the fly . Didn 't exactly want to send this out on the wire . May , you 're not sharing again . Now would be a really good time to share . The police also have another victim in custody . Critical condition . Under sedation , he mentioned seeing a girl , saying it was the one from the news . Quake . Which you didn 't want to send over the wire . You were pulled off Daisy 's case . The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times . The Director thinks you let her . No , we pursued her . She was a ghost . Well , in his infinite wisdom , he says you 're now forbidden to . But you 're telling us this because ... ? In case we want to do something about it . Look , I can bury this until the official police report comes through . That 'll buy us a few hours lead time . Get to L.A. , sniff around . Yeah . We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that 's due for a check-in soon enough . It 'll justify our presence there , but as soon as the report 's filed , they 'll pull us out . And the armed forces will be sent in after her . With orders to kill . - To kill ? - If she 's responsible for these bodies . - That 's not Daisy 's M.O. - The world knows her as Quake , and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges . - Oh , come on . We both know - She 's hunting violent radicals . She 's tracking these fanatics , the Watchdogs , trying to take down their funding , their ... their escape routes . Regardless , you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP . Find her before the military does something bad . Or Daisy does something worse . Hey . You can 't be here . Stop right there . How are we feeling today ? I 've been tracking weapon sales , and I know you were hired to steal one . You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out . We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job . Who was that hunting you ? Man : Open the door ! He nailed me , but we almost got away . Who was it ? - Did he kill my friends ? - All but one . But you 're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I 'm gonna find him alive . Save him , please , before he gets burned , too . You 'll see your buddy again once you heal up . - Just tell me what 's ... - No . No . It 's too late for me . They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul . And a soul can never heal . Stop right there ! Hello ? Hello ? I hear my voice echo , but it sounds strange in my head . The detail is amazing . However , I am 3 feet off the ground . Wait . What ? Hold on . Damn it . Uh , well , I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason . - What does that look like now ? - Better . The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count . Textures are impeccable . We should build a place to get away ... a meadow or a cottage somewhere . I wish it were ever this quiet . Direct-current stimulation . Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback . So I 've just mapped your brain 's response ... Response to the environment . Of course . Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture ? Yeah . Yeah , he calls it " The Framework . " But all the transcranial apparatus , that 's all me . No . Of course , you 're brilliant , too . Of course . 'Cause soon you won 't even need the eyewear or the earwear , 'cause it 'll all be inside your head . So May 's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs . Hey , hey . Authorized personnel only , pal . No pass , no entry . - Who the hell are you ? - Leave them be , Nathanson . They have more reason to be here than you do . Wow . A lot of new faces . Good to see yours . Six weeks . That 's a record . - Heard you got a promotion . - Oh , yeah , and a title . Yeah , Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology . Or " SADIST . " - They keeping you busy ? - With busywork , mostly . Yeah , and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests . So that 's the cost of being in the Director 's inner circle . Yeah , he 's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run . Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program . Or " WIMP . " Hey , uh , you should join us 'cause we 're gonna go to Radcliffe 's and watch the Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final . They 're ... Those are football teams . I 'm not sure they are , Turbo . Unfortunately , we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes , so ... Okay . All right . Well , strictly business , then . Aw , yeah . New toys ? The exploding pen that you asked for . I can 't imagine a use for it . You never wanted one ? And for you , Direct ... uh , Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles . And the directions will be there when you boot it up . What 's , uh ... What 's the assignment ? - It 's classified . - Right . Everything is these days . - Fitz , sadly , um ... - Yeah , you can 't make the match , either . - I have to finish my reports . - Yeah , no , I get it . That 's okay . Just a shame we hardly get to see each other . - Any of us . - Yes , well ... At least it 's better than the friends we 'll never see again . _ _ We just stole a box . I don 't even know what was inside of it . We ... We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler , we parked it in a warehouse , and we just left it . Left it for who ? The Chinatown Crew . They set the job up and were willing to pay big . Lies . Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese ? I swear ! I swear that 's all I know . Where 's this warehouse ? I ... I can 't tell you that , man . My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback ... the ones you didn 't already kill . If you don 't tell me , you 'll have to tell him . This guy 's missing . The rest are dead . Aryan Brotherhood . They 're not my kind of brothers . They 've been know to work for cash . Burglary , assault ... sort of the value meal of hired guns . They 're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig . - Probably prepping for a larger score . - Big , yellow , hard to hide . So , what , are we looking for this thing ? And if Daisy 's chasing the same angle , maybe we get to the finish line first . I 'll greet her when she arrives . - Agent Coulson ? - Davis . Preparing for decent . Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac . What ? - How 's your wife , Davis ? - Getting bigger every day . - Oh . Don 't tell her that . - More beautiful every day . There you go . Mack . Yo-Yo . - Just have a few questions . - I 'm all yours . Uh , so , I see you went to Colombia for a week . Mm-hmm . Mm . And , uh , tickets to Miami coming up . Yes . Do you watch me sleep or shower or ... ? Just procedure . You don 't have to use a satellite to get to know me better . Just ask me to dinner again . You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field . Oh , we haven 't fraternized anything yet . And I thought you were breaking the rules , coming to do my checkup early just to see me . Or are you here because , uh , there 's been a lot of little earthquakes lately ? Daisy could be in the area . But officially , that 's not the mission . Doesn 't matter . We 'll never find her . She 's always one step ahead . What is the official mission ? Can I help ? Here 's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords , - which you signed ... - Oh , all right . ... require approval by the United Nations subcommittee ... - before an enhanced indiv ... - Rules , rules , rules . Blah , blah , blah . S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now , Turtleman . - I prefer to move fast . - Uh ... Mack , they found the truck . Good to see you , too , Coulson ! Well , if you 're in Miami , look me up . Just because we can 't work together doesn 't mean we can 't live a little . Hey , just in time . They 've just taken to the pitch . Where 's Jemma ? Is she not coming ? Yeah , she wanted to . Same story . All work and no play , huh ? That 's a bit disappointing . Still , make yourself comfortable . I 'm just , uh , finishing cleaning up . Yeah , should be pretty lopsided , don 't you think ? Their keeper 's absolutely crap ... Oh , my gosh ! I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . I had no idea there was somebody here . Hello . You ... You weren 't meant to see that . Hello . I 'm glad to final ... - Hello . I 'm glad to final ... - Fitz , meet Aida . - Hello . I 'm glad to final ... - She 's , uh , crashed . Hello . I 'm glad to final ... Hello . I 'm glad to final ... Hello . I 'm glad to final ... Hello . I 'm glad to final ... Hello . I 'm glad to final ... Hello . I 'm glad to final ... - What the hell ? - Well , I 've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing . Must have overcranked it . I 'll reboot . Unh-unh , that 's not what I meant . I meant ... - ... what the hell ? ! - Well , you 've already met Aida , digital personal assistant , as a voice on the computer . So , uh ... - I built her a body . - Yeah , a naked body . I-I was just now installing new hardware , updating her gyroscopic sensors . I 'm not some sicko . When did you build this ? Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon ? You are not allowed experimentation - without approval and oversight ! - Oversight , I know . I 'm well aware of that , yeah . That 's why I wanted Simmons here . I wanted to show both of you . Look . This has been a lifelong dream of mine , Fitz . When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson 's hand , I knew ... I knew right then that this was within reach . - A robot ? - Not just a robot . It 's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side ... pass for a human . I mean , it has bloody micro-expressions . She . It 's a ... It 's definitely a " she " ' cause I saw ... - Yes ... - She has micro-expressions , full range of motion . I mean , physically , it 's ... - she 's nearly perfect . - She is very realistic . Now , mentally , well , you 've spoken with Aida . She 's bright , she laughs at the jokes I programmed her to recognize , but she 's never pass the Turing test . At the moment , that 's a pipe dream . However , I think , with your help ... No , no . No , no , no , no ! We have to report this right away . - You could lose everything . - I know . - Or you could go to jail . - I know ! I know , you 're right . Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action . I ... I agree . Hmm . At least let me show you how it works . They 're in town . I supposed you guessed that , texting me . They 're looking for a truck . That mean you have something for me ? They watch my every move , but certain moves they can 't see . You can 't get these over the counter . S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing , yes ? I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up . - Are you pushing yourself too hard ? - Don 't worry about me . You can 't use your powers too much . - Your body will break down . - I 'm fine . I 'm surprised you 're still in town . You 're usually moving and moving . Are you , uh , still hunting those perros rabiosos ? It 's not just the Watchdogs now . Local gangs have been working for them , which I ... don 't understand . I was tracing the sale of a weapon , and I ... I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer . Ooh . Fun . He live around here ? He mostly hits this area , but he 's hard to track down , leaves no traces behind , operates alone . Sound familiar ? I thought maybe you were , uh , growing roots , they say . - L.A. used to be where you hang out , no ? - No roots . Everyone gets attached to something eventually . Don 't forget to wait two stops after I get off . Yeah , yeah . Hey . Send me a picture of this guy . Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like . No , I still haven 't gotten a good look at him yet , so just ... take care of yourself , okay ? But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel . They won 't give up on you , especially Coulson . All he wants is to find you . Well , that 's too bad , ' cause there 's only one thing I want . Oh , yeah ? What 's that ? Nothing to lose . Here 's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested . Should help your team in case of a blind takedown . - Great . Thanks . - I need you to sign for it . I don 't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of ... - What 's it called ? - The " Spectrum of Security . " Why do I , level red , have to go through you , level orange , to request hardware ? Shouldn 't red be higher than orange ? Well , orange encompasses both red and yellow , so ... It 's hard to explain , but the Director didn 't want to use numbers because he didn 't want any team member to feel less than . Well , you do have a higher clearance than me . Only in most instances . I feel less than . Hey , we just had a report come in . A death in a hospital in Los Angeles . Suspicious circumstances . Suspect is an Asian female . You think it might be Daisy . I 'm going to look into it . I just wondered if you 'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts ? I 'm mostly in the dark these days . Why don 't you ask the Director ? Since you 're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that . What you got there ? Didn 't hear ? Word is , he hit again last night . - Two dead in the street . - Who ? Ghost Rider . You must not be from around here . Do you know where I can find him ? Nobody does . Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall . " Everyone gets attached to something . " We got to get this truck out of here . What are you , the Feds ? Something like that . We 'll be sealing the scene . Not for long , I hope . I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work . We got this . This warehouse usually sits empty . We were gonna store some inventory today . Found the lock broken and this big , honkin ' thing inside . - Have at it . - Thank you . Not fair . You want tech like this , you should 've cut off your own hand . Mack . Okay . Looks like these guys tore each other apart . Zhang Wei , resident of Monterey Park . Organ donor . Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster ? Uh , no , I 'm not seeing anything about that here , so we have to assume that he wasn 't until he came in contact with whatever 's in that trailer . Not much here that 'll lead us anywhere . Well ... there 's that . There was no buyer there . No , no , no . No ! Please , God , no ! No ! I don 't deserve to die ! - No ! No ! - Everyone says that . No ! No ! No ! Yeah , those chargers are hard to find . Between " Fast and Furious " and " Dukes of Hazzard , " they wrecked a lot of them . My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race . He 's pretty broken up . I guess he was more attached to it than I thought . I ain 't seen none around here , though . - Sorry . - All right . Thanks , man . Hey , uh , most of them wrecked movie cars , they 're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage . If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up , might want to go over there and find scraps . Thanks . Maybe he 'll go there . Daisy 's in Los Angeles . There was an eyewitness , now dead , and I just received Yo-Yo 's check-in report a week early , which means Coulson and Mack are there , too , - no doubt , trying to track Daisy down . - Sounds right . You know it is , because according to the logs , you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself . Why , if not to give him that intel in person , knowing it 's against the Director 's orders ? I didn 't send them . I don 't have the authority . - They acted on their own . - You knew I 'd find out . Why not tell me ? I have daily lie detection . - That 's why . - And now I have to report it , which means now I either look like I 'm incompetent - or colluding with you . - Wouldn 't want you falling out of favor with the director . Okay . I get it . It 's abundantly clear you 're uncomfortable with my new position ... I just want to know how comfortable you are with it . You actually trust this guy ? Our team split up to lead departments , given different colors . 'Cause we 're experts ? No . I think the Director broke up the band on purpose . Of course he did ! As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president , things changed . I knew we 'd be divided , undermined , kept in the dark , so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this . After all we 've been through ... I don 't trust the new Director , but he trusts me , so now , in order to keep that trust , I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol . I 'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field , by force , if necessary . Clean up whatever mess he 's in . - That 's an order . - Yes , ma 'am . Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building . That 'll give us visuals through the walls . This could be very dangerous . - So much could go wrong . - Ultron , yes . I know . But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned , and that 's good . This is mimicry of human behavior . Still , in the wrong hands , this could be used as a weapon . - Is that the idea ? - No , absolutely not . No ... Look , I know the dangers . That 's why I 've been ... I 've been reticent to divulge . I don 't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D. But a weapon is absolutely not the idea . Well , then , why ? What 's she for ? Why not let Aida tell you herself ? Hello . I 'm glad to finally shake your hand , Leopold . Where 's Jemma ? We were hoping that she would come . S-She 's , uh ... indisposed , I 'm afraid . Aida ... - I was wondering ... - Yes , Agent Fitz ? I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for . Of course . Dr. Radcliffe , time and again , has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it . He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer , having lost so many friends ... Lincoln Campbell , Andrew Garner , Antoine Triplett ... Okay , stop it , stop . You don 't have to list them . Sorry . The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies ... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm 's way in their place . - To kill ? - No . I am incapable of that . I will protect . I will serve as a decoy target , a safeguard ... - ... a shield . - Okay . T-Turn her off . We can 't tell Simmons about this . What ? Don 't we want to move forward ? Her approval is ... This is too dangerous to show the new Director . We don 't know what he 'd do with it . And she would have to tell him , so ... she can 't know . - Not until ... - Until ... ? Until she 's perfect . They 're walking in now , six . Really convivial-looking fellows . At least four of them are packing . We should be tapped into surveillance now . Let 's see what we get . Where are the other two men ? We had to leave them at the pick-up site . Explain . Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport . Maybe they peeked inside or something . But they went berserk and tore into each other . There was blood everywhere . We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck . No , no . Look , we were freaking out . We had to get out of there ! Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean ? Because if not , they can be traced back here . They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it , you idiot ! I have been told it 's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees . We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup , headquarters will know we 're on Daisy 's trail . No orders to pull out . She 's been tracking this sale . - She could show up here any minute . - I don 't know . Let 's let this play out , see if anyone else makes an appearance . Excuse me . Uh , the yard 's closing . To sell a junker , you can call the number on the gate . Oh , no , I 'm not here for that . I , uh ... Uh , sorry . What 's your name ? Robbie . Well , Robbie , I am looking for a guy with a sweet black ' 69 Charger . Maybe he bought some parts here . Sorry . Doesn 't ring a bell . I only work nights once a week . Uh , well , maybe I 'll ... I 'll come back in the morning . Thank you . Or ... there 's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office . Not really an office . More of a trailer , but I can show you . That would be great , thank you . The hell ... ? What was that ? A breath of fresh air . Get away from me ! That 's it there . - So , you live around here ? - No , I used to . I 'm just in town for a couple days , soaking up the sun . Strange place to spend your vacation . Not a great neighborhood . So ... you 've got the devil inside you , too . What 's going on , guys ? Call for backup , yeah ? We can 't wait for Daisy . These guys might kill somebody besides each other . Yeah . Us . Z One , we got a situation . We need a little help here . That was efficient . You guys know what to do . Damn . All clear . You shouldn 't have gotten involved . Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene . I only kill asesinos who deserve it . It 's vengeance , chica . For what ? You killed a detective . But he had blood on his hands . - A teacher ! - A pedophile . You don 't get to decide who deserves to die . I 'm not the one who decides . Do it . I deserve it . Do it . Hey . Thank for the ride , Janet . You never accept rides . Bus break down ? Or you still trying to holler at Janet 's little sister ? Maybe . I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn 't finish high school . Yo , I finished high school ... in the 11th grade . " Everyone 's attached to something . " - Spent a lot of time in here ? - Too much . My wallet 's starting to get sick of it . Your little side mission didn 't go unnoticed . Well , you showed up , so , yeah . The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q. - No Daisy , huh ? - No . But she was tracking these guys , so maybe this is a win . I don 't know . The ground team is checking for contagion , but hopefully , whatever messed with these guys heads is no longer an issue . We 're gonna analyze the box it came in . It 's good ... to have a moment , just us . It 's been a long time since we had a moment alone . - You okay ? - Yeah . Just a long day . Well , take advantage of the down time . Who knows what tomorrow holds ?

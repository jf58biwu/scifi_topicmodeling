 Previously on " The 100 : " There are consequences , Bel . Lincoln is dead . I bring you Chancellor Pike of the Sky People . - Where are you taking him ? - To the new Commander . May I join you ? Luna ... we 're on our way . Nightblood . Luna has it . That 's why we have to find her . If she can access A.L.I.E. 2 ... She can tell us how to stop A.L.I.E. 1 . Jaha is using the chip to control everyone . The more minds turn to the task , the more powerful A.L.I.E. becomes . Now that Arkadia has fallen , we 'll move on to stage two . What we 're doing is too important , and we won 't be done until everyone is with us . About what I expected . Shut your mouth . Hey ... we should leave . Think you 're gonna find peace with the new Commander ? Go on . Move . Chancellors . Jackson ? What the hell are you doing here ? Those aren 't necessary . This man belongs to the Commander . It 's all right , Jackson . _ _ Thelonious , what is this ? This is the chip . I thought you were crazy . Now I know you are . This is unity , like you always wanted . Everyone back away , or the Commander dies . Thank God . Briggs , Grant , get behind me . Briggs ! You 're Farm Station . There are no stations here , just the City of Light . Join us , Charles , please . There 's no more need for fighting . We both know there 's no way in hell I 'm taking that thing . Sorry it has to be this way . No ! No . How about you , Marcus ? We need him . He can help us find Clarke and the other A.I. That was a mistake . I don 't think so . You will . Let me go ! We are still experiencing a 3 % rejection rate . Don 't put Marcus with the others . Leave him to me . She can be persuasive . Chancellor , Dr. Griffin . Thank you for coming , Charles . I didn 't know I had a choice . So what is all this ? What I 'm about to tell you is classified . If you tell anyone any part of it ... I 'll be floated . I understand . Good . I need you to teach a crash course in wilderness survival ... farming , hunting , building shelters . To the prisoners ? Yes . Well , can I ask why ? We 're sending them to the ground . We have 99 prisoners here . We 've divided them into small , more manageable groups . They 'll be dead the moment the door opens . The ground won 't be survivable for another hundred years or more . What did you find ? Tell me . We 're only telling you what you need to know , Charles , nothing more . Your daughter 's in the sky box . It must be pretty compelling evidence of survivability if you 're willing to risk her life . Clarke 's in solitary . You won 't be seeing her . That 's ok . She paid attention the first time . Look . I 've ... I 've taught most of these kids already or ... or tried to . They 're not exactly receptive learners , though I suppose they will be now . They don 't know they 're going . And if you tell them ... I 'll be floated . Got that . Think of it this way . You finally get to teach Earth skills to kids who might actually use them . Admittedly , it 's ... it 's a leap of faith , Charles . Take it with us . I can have them ready in 4 months , - 3 if I ... - They leave in two weeks . Ha ha ! Uh ... when do I start ? Let 's go . Take a seat . Ok . Come on . Ok . Keep moving . Oh ... It 's the girl under the floor . Welcome to Earth skills . It 's been an hour since we passed the airplane wreckage . Seeing as we 're using a map without any distances , it could be days before we reach Luna 's village . At least we know we 're going the right direction . We 're running out of daylight . We should stop in the sun , recharge the battery . What sun ? We keep going until it dies . We keep going until we get to Luna . This her ? Yes . What do you think she 's gonna say when we show up asking to put an A.I. in her head ? Lincoln said she helps those that are in trouble . She 'll help us , too . Think she can help us find a better map ? Backtrack . We 'll find somewhere where the trees aren 't so bad . Hey ! Guess we 're going on foot . Anyone hear the part where I said it could be days ? Stop . You hear that ? Water . Eyes sharp . They could be hostile . They 're not hostile . Put the guns down . Where 's the village ? No . Oh , no . It can 't be . Isn 't a village . It 's just a bunch of rocks . She 's gone . What do we do now ? The ability to make fire kept the human race alive during the Ice Age . There we go . Here we go . Yeah . Who knows ? It may do the same for us someday . Ahh ... voil√† ... the difference between life and death . Thank you , Mr. Murphy . Perhaps you 'd like to tell us the key to surviving on the ground . No , not really . No . Ms. Blake , how about you ? The key to survival on Earth , what is it ? Not dying ? You can laugh all you want , but we 've got a lot to learn here ... making fire , tying knots , how to navigate using the stars , how to hunt . You have to learn which plants you can eat and which ... Which ones we can smoke ? Mr. Jordan , that is precisely why we had to separate you and Mr. Green . Listen . The answer to my question . The key to surviving on the ground and on the Ark is to keep fighting at all costs against all odds . The minute you give up , you 're dead . Am I boring you , Mr. Murphy ? I 'll survive . Hey ! Hey , you want to kill me , kill me ! Briggs , you don 't have to do this . You 're strong ! Fight it ! We 'll get our people and get out of here . Briggs ! Who 's ready to take the key ? Ohh ... What are the odds ? John Murphy ? Told you I 'd survive . You should have killed me on that battlefield . I won 't make the same mistake . You killed 300 of my people . Now you 'll take 300 cuts by my hand . Get on with it . It 'll be dark soon . We need to talk about what we 're gonna do . We wait until first light , and then we split up and search the shore in both directions . Nice . Yes . I agree . Lincoln wouldn 't have put this spot on the map unless it was important . Don 't touch that . Come on , O. How long ? I don 't know . I can 't even look at you ... because every time I do , I see Pike putting that gun to Lincoln 's head . I hear the gunshot . I see him fall . I didn 't kill Lincoln . No , but he is dead because of you . I came to you . You didn 't take my help . If you had just trusted me , I ... What did you just do ? Nothing . I just threw these in the fire . What is it ? Huh . Signal fire . He was trying to tell us . This is how we contact Luna . I 'll get more . Abby . Marcus , oh , thank God . Are you all right ? Did they hurt you ? They found me hiding in the woods near the camp . Please tell me you know where Clarke is . No . I thought she was here . He 's telling the truth . No . I saw them shoot at her . She got in the rover with Jasper , and they got away , I 'm ... I 'm sure . Well , that 's good . If the others found her , that means she 's safe . Listen to me . They 're after Clarke . How do you know they 're after her ? They questioned me for hours . She has something that they want . What ? What ? I don 't know . We don 't have time for this . If Ontari is right and Clarke finds another Nightblood , she 'll be able to activate the other A.I. We can 't let that happen . Marcus ... I 'm afraid . Try harder . He knows . Marcus . You 've taken the chip . Put him on the cross . Abby ... Abby . Abby , wait ! Abby ! Abby . Listen , Abby , please . Don 't . Abby , this is madness ! - This is unity . - Abby , please ... - Take the key . - Please ... wake up . Just tell us where Clarke and the others are hiding . I can 't do that . I ... Let me guess , you came here to fix things , Wanheda the Peacemaker . I came to see if you 're ok . Well , I don 't need your help . Clarke , I 've lost her . Give her time , Bellamy . There may be blood on your hands , but it 's not Lincoln 's . Some of it is . Maybe , but you didn 't want that to happen . You tried to stop it . Octavia will forgive you eventually . The question is , will you forgive yourself ? Forgiveness is hard for us . I was so angry at you for leaving . I don 't want to feel that way anymore . You know , you 're not the only one trying to forgive yourself . Maybe we 'll get that someday ... but we need each other , Bellamy . What we 're doing now , the only way we 're gonna pull this off is together . No . No . It 's ok . _ _ Skaikru , bringers of death . Why should we give you safe passage ? Lincoln . He sent us . _ - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . What is that ? Safe passage . What does it do ? Octavia , wait . I trust Lincoln . If only she drinks , only she goes . See you on the other side . O. Oh , crap . Oh , God ... Last chance . Together . _ I 'm sorry to hear about your son 's arrest . Will he be in my class today ? No . We 're keeping Wells in solitary until launch tomorrow . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . You don 't want him telling the others that the Ark is dying . Charles ... It 's the only thing that makes sense . Why else would you send kids , and not scientists ? Do you even care if they live or die ? We are talking about my son . Yes . Then send me with them . Out of the question . - What you teach them will ... - Well , I 've taught them nothing ! They don 't care , so they don 't learn . They don 't pay attention because they don 't think they have a reason to . Let me tell them we 're sending them down , - and maybe if they 're afraid , then ... - No . No . Please . I 've only got one more class to reach them . Then figure out a way to reach them , because you are all they 've got . All right . Can we just get out of here , seriously ? You got better things to do , Murphy ? Oh , is that an offer , Mclntyre ? You 're an epic dick , Murphy . Everybody take your seats . Now ! I 'm sure all of you will be glad to know that we are officially done talking about Earth skills . Oh , great . In that case ... Sit down . How would you feel about assisting me with today 's lesson , Mr. Murphy ? Sign me up . What the hell was that fo ... - Oh ! - Oh , jeez . I know all about you , John Murphy . - Ah , you do , huh ? - Yeah . I do . Mother drank herself to death after father was floated for stealing medicine to save you . That 's a tough row to hoe . I 'll give you that . So what does he do with the second chance his father gave his life to buy for him ? Wasted it setting the arresting officer 's quarters on fire . Say something . Do something . You know , I get it ... trying to teach us to fight back . - Wrong . - Hey ! Hey ! Stop it ! Leave him alone ! No one is coming to help you . No one is coming to help any of you . Get off him ! Get off him ! Is that all you got ? It 's gonna take more than the kids from your own station to save you . - Who will save you ? - Open the door ! Help ! Override it . Don 't you see ? This is life or death . Open the door ! Help ! Hey ! - Charles , you all right ? - Fine . Are you out of your minds ? What the hell is this ? This is graduation . Congratulations . Class dismissed . You can 't break me , Grounder . If you want her to stop , maybe you should try shutting up . Only one way this stops . What is wrong with you people ? He 's strong . We need him if we 're gonna fight our way out of here . Listen to me ! Our real enemy is out there . Jaha has an army of chipped soldiers . They don 't feel any pain . That means they 're not gonna stop until all of us either join them or die . Don 't waste your breath , kid . _ _ _ Ask yourself this . Do you want your revenge , or you want your people to live ? Both . I 'll get my revenge , just not today . Go float yourself . Everything I learned , I learned on the ground . T minus 5 minutes and counting . Have you seen Monty ? Is he already on board ? Move it . Wait . What are we doing ? Abby , it 's time . May we meet again . Let 's go . I 'm sorry , Abby . You got your extra air . Marcus , let me stop the pain . He 's strong . Yes , always has been . Marcus , I 'm afraid we 're out of time . We need to know where the resistance you led against Pike hides . Just shoot me . Shoot me . If I shoot you , I won 't get the answer . Wait . You can stop this . All right . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . Take the key . Where the hell are we ? My sword 's gone . Guns , too . Luna . Where 's Lincoln ? Lincoln is dead . Lincoln said that you would help us . Did he ? Luna , you 're the last of your kind , the last Nightblood . So Lexa 's dead , as well . Her spirit has chosen you to become the next Commander . Titus entrusted me with the Flame to give to you . Then he should have told you that I left my conclave swearing to never kill again . You don 't have to kill . To lead is your birthright . How you lead is your choice . Here . I recognize the sacred symbol , but what is that ? This is the Flame that holds the spirits of the Commanders , of Lexa . Will you take it and become the next Commander ? No . Hey , wait .

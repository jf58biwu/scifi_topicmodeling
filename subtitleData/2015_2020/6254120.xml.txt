 BIG JIM : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons ... rage ... grief ... fear . My God . ( people exclaiming ) Now , in order to survive , we must battle our most dangerous adversary ... the enemy within . Do you remember what we talked about ? What you need to do for Barbie ? I 'll do whatever it takes . Christine and Eva are using you . They want you to become like them . Barbie 's not the same . And Aktaion 's all dead . We 're on our own . Abby ! ( sobbing ) - ( stabbing ) - I 'm sorry , but I 'll never be able to be who you want . - NORRIE : What happened ? - I was supposed to meet Sam . Why should you forgive him ? He killed Angie ! You should 've told him to go screw himself . This is you . You 're back . Your fourth cervical vertebra is fractured . You 'll never walk again . If it 's what 's best , then I want to do it . No ! Let 's get him the hell out of here ! What happened ? Get me to the caves . Bring me Sam . ( high-pitched pulsing ) Hey , what are you ... Hey ! EVA : Dale ! Dale , help ! - Help ! - Eva ! I 'm on my way ! Dale , don 't do this . Dale ! - No . - Audrey , no ! What the hell are you doing ? There 's no one to guide us . I need to jump . Stop ! You don 't want to do this . Stop ! ( panting ) ( pulsing continues ) It 's a shooting star . Those can 't all be shooting stars . JULIA : Here , boy , Indy . That all you got ? You got to put your gut into it . Indy ! He 's a dog ; he can hear us . I 'm trying not to scare him away . Indy 's not a liberal . He doesn 't get scared of everything . Indy ! Indy ! Indy ! ( gasps ) Pink stars ? Oh , don 't start with that crap again . Jim , look . What the hell ? Shooting stars burn out . Did that star just hit us ? Oh , my God . Looks like a meteor ! BARBIE : Well , at least , the pink stars seem to calm everyone down . Audrey said , " There 's no one to guide us . " She must have meant Christine . Well , where is she ? I don 't know , but until she shows up , we have to make sure the town stays safe . ( distant rumbling ) Was that the dome ? Tell me it 'll protect us from the meteors . It held against the largest non-nuclear ordnance the military has . A meteor impact is thousands of times stronger . Yes , it is . There must be something we can do . You 're not one to sit around and do nothing . I 'll go to the fire tower . I mean , that 's got a view of the whole town . So I can survey the damage , see if the dome held everywhere . - When do we leave ? - Whoa , we ? If it 's safe enough for you , it 's safe enough for me . Okay . So we go to the fire marshal 's office . We get the key . Key gets us access into the tower . " Rusty loves Linda . " BARBIE : Yeah , Linda was our sheriff . She died when the dome was magnetized . The dome held . And what if this has happened everywhere ? You saw how many meteors there were . Some will survive . Yes , some will survive the initial impact , but then the debris that was kicked up into orbit , that 'll rain down . And then the sun will disappear behind a dust cloud , and then comes the firestorm . How do you know all this ? I 'm an anthropologist . We study extinction level events . Yeah , well , you could be wrong . I could be , but I 'm not . The debris is falling now . I always thought the end would be caused by us . Nuclear war , global warming . The brick wall seen coming but slammed into anyway . All those people . Billions of them . You know , we spent so much time trying to figure out how to get out of this thing , and now , if only we could figure out a way to get someone inside . - The red door . - What ? It 's a way in . We can get word out . We got to get to Bird Island . Why do you want to go to Bird Island ? Aktaion 's there . They have to be communicating with the outside world . There is a way in , okay ? I know . I 've been through it before . That 's a long shot that it 's still standing , but for anyone that 's alive out there , it 's the only shot that they have . That might not be a good idea . - Eva , where 's the key ? - What key ? The key for the hatch . I thought you had it . - No , I stuck it right here . - Did it fall ? Start looking . We got to find the key . ( metal snapping ) Damn it ! Maybe it 's a good thing we 're stuck . How is that a good thing ? If you were able to get a message to the outside world , you and I both know what would happen . It 'd be chaos . People would do horrific things to one another to get through that door . And those are the people who would make it in . People like Big Jim or Julia . People only interested in themselves . We-we can deal with those people . The real problem is : How do you feed them ? The thousand , 10,000 that would come through . Our-our resources are already stretched thin . You 're a good man , Dale . You want to do what 's right , but look out there . This is no longer about right or wrong . This is about survival . The survival of this town . Yeah , but you can 't let everybody on the outside just die without trying to do something . So many burdens . So much weight on your shoulders . It can all go away . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about ... no more worry . No more fear . No more doubt . You can be free , like me . In the process , join something greater . You can evolve . Do you feel it , Dale ? The pull ? I know you can , just as I do . That 's the kinship . There 's harmony there . There 's peace . Freedom . You 'll still be you . With all your thoughts and desires . You still have desires , don 't you ? ( jingling ) Did you hide this ? I ... Dale , where are you going ? To Bird Island . Dale . NORRIE : Was that ... ? A meteor impact . Yeah , like the one that killed all the dinosaurs . ( dome creaking ) Is the dome cracking ? HUNTER : What the hell 's going on ? We don 't know . But it 's like an apocalypse out there . No . I meant , why did you bring me here ? Eva was gonna kill you . But I wanted her to . How can you even say that ? It 's best for the kinship . I 'm using up all the pain medication . What if others get sick ? The group 's survival comes first . Your medication must be wearing off . The pain 's making you say this . I 'm not in pain , and I know exactly what I 'm saying . If you weren 't so selfish , you 'd understand . - Hey . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! - Hunter , you can 't leave . - Hey ! - Help ! In the Sweetbriar ! - I need help ! - Just shut up ! - You want to die ? - Yes ! Help ! Get off ... - Help ! Help ! - Stop . Let 's lock him in the freezer . ( muffled shouting ) NORRIE : Shut up . I can 't believe he 's pissed about us trying to save his life . Julia said there 's something inside of us ... and it must be that that 's making him act like this . We 're infected . Terrific . More giant-ass meteors ? Secondary impacts . When debris from the first impact comes raining back down . It 's called " ejecta . " Or , you know , maybe it 's ... you know , not that . So you 're telling me that those seizures that we had when we said " the pink stars are falling ... " meant that we were prophesying the end of the world ? Look ... I probably have no idea what I 'm talking about . Even if we survive whatever 's infecting us , the whole world is gone . There 's no future for us . We have nothing to look forward to . Maybe we should just join them . The kinship ? No way . What 's the point , Joe ? This entire town was infected in those cocoons . The kinship has won . No , it hasn 't . We resisted . ( door opens , bell chimes ) Stay down . Be quiet . Just stay here . - ( grunts ) - Joe , stop ! I 'm not gonna hurt you . What are you two doing here ? HUNTER ( muffled ) : Help ! Help ! Is someone in there ? You 're not taking him . Taking who ? What 's going on ? Did Junior and Eva send you ? Are you a part of the kinship ? No . Not after what they did to Abby . And I take it from the fact that you have someone in the freezer you 're not part of the kinship , either . JOE : After everything you 've done , why should we listen to anything you say ? Because I killed Christine . If Christine 's dead , does that mean the infection 's gone ? I don 't know . What infection ? No way , Norrie . I still don 't trust him . He killed Angie , and now he 's killed again . Joe . What Sam did to Angie is unforgivable . But we 're all fugitives from the kinship . And there 's not many of us . ( Hunter moans ) Why is he gagged ? JOE : Because he wouldn 't stop yelling . NORRIE : We took him from Eva because she was trying to kill him , which he said he wanted . ( grunts , gasps ) I won 't yell . I don 't want them to find me . Thank you for saving my life . Looks like you broke a couple ribs during the fall , as well . You 'll heal , but it 's gonna take a while . We didn 't bring any pain medication . Here . This will get you through a few hours . Do you remember what happened ? Eva told me I was using up too many resources . That it would be best if I died . I said , " Okay . " What made you change your mind ? I don 't know , it 's weird . I ... I remember thinking that all I cared about was the kinship . That it felt more important than my own life . But it doesn 't now ? I don 't want to die . It 's good to have you back , Hunter . - Incoming . - SAM : Get in the freezer . They won 't look for you if they find me . Go . Go , go , go , go . ( Hunter groaning ) Hey . Hey . Why are you doing this ? I can never make up for what I did to you , but I can protect you . Give you a chance to fight back against whatever 's happening to us . Whatever you hear , don 't come out . ( bell on door chiming ) ( footsteps ) ( freezer door closes ) All clear . ( freezer door opens ) Told you they 'd be gone . I heard the door chime again . Who do you think was here ? I don 't know , but Sam saved our asses . The sun rose . At least there 's that . ( groans ) Hey . How you feeling ? Any better ? What ? Hey . Drink this , it 'll help . ( Norrie shrieks , Joe grunts ) You 're keeping me from doing my duty for the kinship . Take me back to Town Hall or I 'll scream . Yeah , and we 'll put you back in the freezer and gag you . Why is he acting like this again ? Uh ... I don 't know . Hunter , no ! - Hey , man , s ... - Get back ! - Stay back . - Calm down , Hunter . I swear , if you come any closer ... - Hunter ... - You want me to calm down ? ! - NORRIE : Stop ! - You are keeping me from doing my duty . ( gasps ) ( sniffs ) Where are they going ? I don 't know . But look at them . They look like ants marching in a line , doing whatever Queen Christine ordered them to . Just a bunch of mindless drones , only caring about her kinship . ( sighs ) Don 't let me get like that . We 're in this together . All the way to the bitter , apocalyptic end . ( chuckles softly ) I was thinking about Hunter . He got all Freaky Friday again right after Sam gave him another one of those pain pills . When he 's in pain , he 's as normal as Hunter will ever be . When he 's on the meds , he 's like one of those drones outside . HUNTER : Joe . Norrie . Oh , God . Should we take bets on which Hunter we 're gonna get ? I don 't know , but if it 's drone boy , we 're screwed . Joe . Norrie , please , help me . The pain is back . I 'm scared . What the hell is going on with you ? I think it 's fear . What do you mean ? When I was eight , I ... was in a car accident with my mom . I was right there watching her die . ( shuddering breaths ) I had no idea . I 'm so sorry . Ever since , my greatest fear is dying young . But ... my point is , after my fall , I should have been scared out of my mind . But I didn 't feel anything because of the pain meds . And then ... when the pills wear off , I remember how afraid I am . ( sniffles ) ( shuddering breaths ) And I 'm me again . It 's not the pain . It 's the emotion . Wh-What do you mean ? Do you remember when Sam stood you up and I lost it ? Yeah . That 's when you said the real me was back . I was angry . Christine is trying to keep us from having emotions . Because when our feelings surface , so does our humanity . For me , it 's anger . And for Hunter , it 's fear . What about me ? Grief . Your sister . It was why Christine wanted you to forgive Sam . So you could move on and join the kinship . Don 't you know what this means ? Do you ? We have a way to fight back . A way to fight the kinship . Pack your stuff . As soon as the coast is clear , we 're leaving . Where are we going ? To find Julia . That damn meteor probably took out half the country . ( dome creaks and rumbles ) We don 't know if what happened outside happened everywhere . We need to contact the outside world . Oh , do we ? What 's knowing gonna do for you ? You know , Jim , if you 're just gonna stand there being useless , why don 't you do it outside where you don 't distract me ? You know , you 're always Miss Can Do , huh ? Fine . I 'll go look for my dog . Indy ? Indy , where you at , boy ? Indy ? _ ( typing ) Change your mind ? You care to help ? ( computer beeps ) Forget it . It 's no use . There 's , um ... there 's nothing left out there . How do you know that ? Go see for yourself . ( gasps ) You need to be doing this now ? Yeah , I knew the guy that owned this house . Ferguson Faulkner . Don 't think ol ' Ferg would want his house turned into a torture chamber . He was a , you know , bleeding-heart type ... rich as he was . And ... he was a lush , too . Which means ... we get to watch the world end while we drink the good stuff . Ah ! Obviously , he was a bird lover , too . Yeah , he loved them so much he had them killed and stuffed . Yeah . ( laughs ) Something funny ? I was just thinking how good I 'd look stuffed up there . They 'd have a hard time with your hair , though . And no trouble at all with yours . Uh-huh , it 's true . Remember that time everything froze ? Yeah , that was the night Barbie ... Barbie what ? Nothing . Never mind . Go on ... with your fascinating story . Well , when I fished Lyle Chumley out of the lake and , um ... sidebar ... I should never do that again . ( laughs ) He started talking about the end of days . And how the world would be on fire in some , you know , wall of flame a thousand feet high . ( scoffs ) Like a lot of things , he got the apocalypse wrong , too . The sixth extinction . What ? Dinosaurs were the fifth extinction . Big old asteroid came . Bye-bye , triceratops ; bye-bye , brontosaurus . We ... humans will be the sixth . Well , we may be an endangered species , but we 're not going the way of the dodo anytime soon . No ? Say this fishbowl doesn 't crack . How long you think it 's gonna be before Christine comes looking to wipe us out ? She said , you know , we stay out of her way , she 'll stay out of ours . Was that before or after you sold her out and I tried to kill her ? I say ... ( grunts ) instead of getting wiped out that we should do the wiping . There 's no point . What , are you afraid of getting your hands dirty ? ( chuckles ) It 's not about that . There 's too many of them ! Look , you and I ... are not much of a resistance ; not without a way to turn people back . Listen , I say we take these . We take out as many of those , uh , those body snatchers as we can . Just , you know , we make a last stand like , uh , Butch and Sundance . Including the part where they die ? See , that 's what you never understood . Since the dome came down , that was the only outcome there was ever gonna be . You 're right . ( laughs ) : I can 't believe I 'm gonna say it , but ... you 're right . ( smacks lips ) Well ... it finally happened , huh ? You finally , uh , giving up on all that ... sunny-side-up , Pollyanna routine , huh ? Talking all that crap about how the dome 's here to save us . Oh , no . I wasn 't wrong . ( laughs ) Oh , the dome 's here to protect . It 's just not here to protect us . Guess this means I 'll never get to go to Paris . Paris ? ( sniffs ) Plenty of stuff to regret more than ... not getting to that dirty ciudad . That 's Spanish . You know , I 'm surprised that , uh , you never made it there , being , uh ... all cosmopolitan like you are . Surprised someone like you ended up here in Chester 's Mill , to be honest . How 'd that happen ? Peter Shumway . ( chuckles ) : Right . You know , I got to tell you , never made sense to me , the two of you . Now you tell me . ( sighs ) : I don 't know . He was a doctor ... maybe I was looking for security . You find it ? ( laughs softly ) You know he was a mess . Couldn 't even take care of himself . I never knew what it felt like to be safe or in love until I met Barbie . And look how that worked out . ( laughs softly , sniffles ) Such a cliché , right ? Falling for the dark , mysterious guy and ... ( clears throat ) then get all bent out of shape when he turns out to be dark and mysterious . Look at us ... two former enemies drinking at the end of the world . ( laughs ) " Former " ? Oh , come on , Jim . ( sighs ) You must have regrets . Yeah , course I do . With Junior . Pushed him too hard , I suppose . Talk about a cliché . Treat your son like a second chance to overcome your own shortcomings instead of treating him like his own person . You named him after yourself , for God 's sake . You 're wrong . Nice try . You know , you and me , we might have some stuff in common , Julia , but do not try to dissect me with your cheapjack psychobabble . There 's only one thing in this life that I regret , and that 's letting everything that I earned , everything I ever cared about ... get taken away from me . And I 'll be damned if I let anything get taken away again . ♪ ( dog barking in distance ) Indy ! ( barking continues ) There you are , boy ! There you are , boy ! Oh , good boy ! There you are !

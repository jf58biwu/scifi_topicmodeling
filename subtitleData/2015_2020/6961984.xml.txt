 Previously on " The 100 " ... The death wave will be here in 10 days . What I found was a fallout shelter , built to sustain thousands . Salvation lies within . The radiation doesn 't care if you 're Trikru or Azgeda . Azgeda will never see the inside . - What if we share it ? - I can live with that . When the time comes to close the door , Azgeda will see that it 's done . I 'll take you home . Raven , you need to slow down . Your brain scan showed evidence of a stroke . The door is stuck . Raven , it could kill you . We can 't create Nightblood unless we go to space , but Luna can . We can inject ourselves with her bone marrow . Then we become Nightbloods . I bear it so they don 't have to . One day , they will thank you for what you 're doing here . What if it doesn 't work ? Then we die , knowing we did everything we could to save our people . I got it . It 's heavy . Uhh . This is why they left us behind ? To scavenge tech ? Hey , we talked about this . We didn 't get left behind . - They 're coming back . - Forgive me if I don 't believe what your people say anymore . Murphy 's actually right . Don 't worry , they might ditch him , but I 'm too awesome to leave behind . - There you go . - Congratulations , Emori . You get to live in a hole in the ground for 5 years . - Thanks for playing . - Come on . At least we get to live . Said the cockroach to the raven . Systems check complete . What ? Orbital launch systems online . You don 't hear that ? Emori , get the Seizure kit now . - Abby left it in the office . - No . No , it 's ... it 's ok . It 's ok . I 'm fine . Put that stuff with the gear for the last run . I 'll start on the processors . No , no , no , no . No coding , all right ? Luna 's not here to whisper in your ear and I 'd rather not have your melt on my watch . I 'm not coding . I 'm unhooking . Now do what I said . Then you can take a break . I 'll need some time with this . Sure thing . Come on . What 's the matter now ? If she can 't use her brain , why do they need her ? Initiating ground launch sequencer now . Uhh . Raven . Becca ? You can tell me that it 's none of my business , but why live in a hole in the ground when you have a perfectly good rocket ? Are you tilling the soil or stabbing it ? You know this is dumb , right ? We 'll all be dead before anything grows . The earth survived Praimfaya once . It will again . We do this for those who come after us . Let me show you . Ilian . Head down . Say nothing . My people are wary of strangers . Ankara . War . You didn 't tell me you were a warrior . Not much point in fighting at the end of the world . Yeah ! There is an underground aquifer with a filtration system that is still operational . Some of the water will go to the hydroponic farm . Isn 't that right , Mr. Green ? Most beautiful thing I 've ever seen . Almost . It won 't be easy . There will be plenty of hard work to go around . But together we have struggled . And together we will rise . Pack your things . Just what you can carry . We leave at first light . Thank you . Thank you . - You 're a hero , Monty . - Stop . Go back . I 'll be there as soon as we finish with the armory . Jaha was right . Got a lot of gear to pack . Sure you 're not too hung over ? You judging me , Monty ? A little . There is no hope . Now there 's hope . Let 's go . Jasper ... You 're gonna love it . Give him a minute . They 'll figure it out - when we take the still . - We don 't need it . There 's one in the bunker . My little boy 's all grown up . So what ? We hole up in a bunker now ? Do everything Jaha says ? Back to life on the Ark ? Now that is just crazy talk . Since when do we listen to what Jaha says ? - The tunnel 's just through those woods . - How long are you staying ? Quick turnaround . If you forgot anything at the lab , let me know . Or I could keep you company . Right . Clarke , can I talk to you for a second ? I 'll catch up . What 's wrong ? There 's something I didn 't tell you . Indra was with them when they found the bunker . Trikru knows ? Yes . We made a deal with them to share the space . What about our deal with Roan ? Trikru would rather go to war - than live with Azgeda . - Mom , Roan is my friend . Our ally . Not anymore . Why didn 't you tell me this before ? - They 're gonna kill him . - No , Clarke , not if he comes peacefully . We will make room for one . Indra agreed . Uh ! Gentlemen . It 's good to see you . - Just ... - Wait here . Where are the guards ? Our people aren 't back from Arkadia yet . - Kane , don 't . Roan ! - Look . Wait . Trikru . What is this ? There doesn 't have to be any violence . Wait , stop ! Welcome back to Polis , my king . I said , explain . Skaikru allied with Trikru to take the temple . They gave up the tower to do it . Strategically , that made no sense , so I put our people at the temple doors . Good thing I did . You did well , Echo . Move the rest of our army to the temple doors . No one gets in or out . Go . - How long have you known ? - I just found out . Thanks for trying to warn me . - This doesn 't have to turn into a war . - It 's already a war . Only if you fight it . Your people betrayed me , Clarke . What would you have me do ? Live ? The radiation 's gonna be here in 6 days . You were willing to share the bunker with us . Why not share it with Trikru , too ? I suppose Kane tried to get Indra to do that before agreeing to let them assassinate me . Believe it or not , Kane was trying to save your life . Mine , maybe . Not my people 's . That was before you surrounded the temple . Look , now no one can get in to survive unless you allow it . Indra will have no choice but to talk . Fine . We 'll talk . But I 'm holding your people . My chancellor needs to be at that meeting , Roan . Your chancellor 's lucky he still has his head . Besides , if anyone can convince mortal enemies to move in together , it 's you . I 'll call for the summit . All I can think about is there 's a war going on and I 'm not in it . No war will stop Praimfaya . At least it would be a warrior 's death . Better than melting . My people have a saying : Reincarnation ? You believe in that ? The crops , they die in winter and then return in spring . Most people don 't know when their winter will come , but we do . And that 's a gift . Why waste it in fighting ? You 're not packed . I tried . Talk to me , Harper . Just tired of fighting , Monty . I know . We all are . But in that bunker , we 'll be safe . Every time we think that , something bad happens . So what then ? Stay here and die ? Spend your last days wasted ? That seems to be a popular choice with the people I care about . - Monty , I ... - It 'll be light out soon . That bunker gives us a chance for a future . I hope you 'll change your mind . I won 't . I was , um ... I was thinking about Louis . About how you blame yourself for his death because you didn 't stop to save him from the black rain . You didn 't do that because you were a coward , Harper . You did that because you wanted to live . It 's called survival instinct . This is the first time I ever thought you were a coward . Aren 't you going the wrong way ? Come to say good-bye ? Hell no . Hey . I thought I made it clear . We need everyone packed and ready to go by ... First light . We 'll get right on it . Good . We 're talking about the future of the human race here , Mr. Jordan . Participation is not optional . - They 're gonna make us go with them . - It 's a test . How bad do we want this ? There is a way out now . When this party started , that wasn 't true . Make no mistake ... You choose to stay and you 're choosing death . If that 's your decision , I 'm with you all the way . If not , there 's the door . No one here will judge you if you leave . Ok , then . I guess we have nothing to lose . You can 't ignore me forever , Raven . I mean , I guess you could try , but we 're the same , you and I , and I know the truth . You don 't want to live in a bunker , and you don 't want to be the good little soldier , always doing what Clarke tells you to do . I know what you do want . Stop . Stop ! God , you 're not ... You 're not real . You 're just ... That doesn 't mean that I 'm not right . What the hell do you want from me ? I want to help you . Your time is running out . And I 'm not talking about the radiation . I 'm talking about your brain . You need to ask yourself ... How are you gonna go out ? Down here ? Miserable ? In pain ? Or up there ? Free ? Floating ? I 've run all the simulations . There 's not enough fuel to get back . Who said anything about getting back ? Your friends are taken care of . They don 't need you to keep them alive in the bunker . But you will need them if you go there . The computer code is destroying your neurons at an advanced rate . Soon you 're not gonna know how to tie your own shoes , let alone how to convert a launch entry suit into something that you can spacewalk in . You can help me spacewalk ? If you 're gonna go out , might as well go out with a view . Come on , come back . I 'm good to go again . Your friend Miller should be back by now . They 're not coming back , John . So we go to Polis ourselves . The boat 's on the wrong side of the water . We 'll never make it . Then I guess we ride out the storm in the lighthouse bunker . For 5 years ? We 'll starve . Who needs food when you have love , right ? We were searched outside . If I 'm not back in an hour , my army will attack . You must be Gaia . - I 'm ... - I know who you are ... Wanheda . You helped my people find the bunker . - Thank you for that . - And you gave the flame to an unworthy king , who saw it destroyed . I am not as grateful . Let 's see what all the fuss is about . After you , Wanheda . All my enemies in one place . Who are they ? The war chiefs of the Trikru alliance . She was supposed to be alone . What fun would that be ? You murdered our people . You burned our villages . Yet you have the nerve to come here in the name of peace . Not peace . Survival . You tried to take this bunker for yourself , yet here I am , willing to talk . The Trikru alliance holds the temple . Of course you 're willing to talk . And the Azgeda alliance surrounds it . None of your people will get inside unless we come to terms . This war is inevitable . The only reason it hasn 't happened before now is that Lexa commanded it . The only thing that 's inevitable is Praimfaya . In 6 days , anyone who is not in this bunker will be dead . Then we should get to it . Roan . We talked . Now we fight . No . There is room for 1,200 people in here . We could share it equally . All of the clans can survive . That 's what Lexa would have wanted . You 're right . She would have . And if she were here , the clans might actually have obeyed her . But seeing that there 's no Commander to rule us ... War it is . What are you doing ? I know you have the flame . - I know Octavia gave it to you . - I think you should leave , Clarke . I can 't let them fight a war over the one thing that can save us . Not even Wanheda can stop the clans from killing each other . No . But a Commander could . Of course a Commander could . Unfortunately , we need a Natblida for that . Make me the Commander . Ahh . It 's jammed . Same as the others . But this is the door to blow . How many gas canisters do we have ? - You can 't be serious . - In mount weather , we beat the gas by using water . Jasper will be ready for that . Just slow down . Let me talk to them . Bellamy , we have over 400 people ready to march . Gun . Harper 's . - How many more of them are armed ? - I don 't know . A few . " DNR " ? Do not resuscitate . Jasper , put down the gun . Open the door . - We 're not coming out . - This is insane . Are you really willing to die , when there 's a way to live ? Are they ? That 's just it . We don 't think it 's a way to live . Just go . Please . We 're wasting time . Set the charge . You can go to guns . Do not fire unless fired upon . - Is that clear ? - No . Ok , just ... Just wait . Jasper , people will get hurt . I know you care about that . If you don 't want anyone to get hurt , don 't open the door . We 're all set . We should clear the hall . Mr. Jordan , I will not leave children here to die . You sent them down to die . The difference now is that they have a choice . And so do you . What are you talking about ? This is what they want . They 're wasted . They don 't know what they want . Stand down . - Get ready to move out . - Yes , sir . What ? No . You can 't . I 'm sorry , son . Bellamy is right . We can 't save them if they don 't want to be saved . If Octavia was in there , would you let her stay ? If Octavia was in there ... At least I 'd get to say good-bye . That 's it , isn 't it ? Skairipa . - - I saw you in Polis . You murdered my friend Terro . Cut off his head . - I 'm not that person anymore . - Uhh ! Please . - You don 't want to do this . - Uhh ! Trust me . Just walk away . Aah ! Uhh ! Aah ! Aah ! This is who I am . Once reinforcements arrive , we can edge in west - to the temple quarter . - No . There 's no time . We need to squeeze out Boudalankru first . Here and here . The ascension call . The flame was destroyed . How is this possible ? You said you saw it . It was shattered . I saw what they wanted me to see . A new Commander is bad for us , Roan . But we control the tower . Let me stop this ascension , at least until we know who the Natblida is . I know who it is . Are you presiding ? Yes . The flame chose me as its protector . Our scouts honor that . - Did one of them find a Natblida ? - Obviously . What clan are they from ? This is highly unusual , Gaia . There was no conclave . There are questions to be answered . What is this ? Wanheda is no Natblida ! Ascende ... Lies upon lies . Get out of this sacred circle . There 's nothing sacred about any of this . Wanheda is making a mockery of our faith . I 'm trying to save us , Your Highness . - You know that . - Because you think we 're savages - in need of saving ? - Praimfaya is almost here . Then let 's not waste any more time . Bring in the healer ! What are you doing ? We don 't know if this works . The flame could kill you . - I have no choice . - Tell them , healer . Go on , tell them all how it is your daughter became a Natblida . Through science . You made her a Nightblood ? Yes . If anyone can be a Natblida , if anyone can take the flame , then we can no longer trust the blood . What we can still trust is the sword . We 've delayed this war long enough . Wait . Wanheda is right about one thing . Fighting a war is a bad way to decide who gets to survive . You summoned all your scouts here for an ascension , but you left out the best part . A conclave . A final conclave . One champion per clan . One death instead of thousands . And whoever wins gets the bunker . Will you fight , or will you burn ? Remember , it 's not black rain , but it can turn at any moment , so keep the person with your assigned chem tent in sight at all times . " No one but us saves ourselves . " We ourselves must walk the path . " - Not too late to change your mind . - Yes , it is . You can still stay , you know ? I 'm not a quitter . Thanks for understanding . Where 's Monty ? Unloading the rover . We 're leaving it behind for you , by the way . He didn 't say good-bye ? Take care of him for us , will you ? You know I will . May we meet again . We won 't . Whatever the hell you want . Monty ? Everyone left . What are you doing here ? I love you , Harper . Change your mind ? No . I 'm here in case you guys change yours . Always the optimist . I love that about you . I 'm glad you stayed . Don 't be a Buzzkill . All right ? All right . We 'll bring this stuff to the lighthouse , see what else we can find on the island . You guys ready or what ? Sorry we 're late . There 's been some developments . - Not all good . They 've ... - Fill you in on the way . Is this everything we need ? - Yeah . - Great . We got it . - Go get Raven . - Don 't have much time . Mass fiery death in 5 days . - Raven . - Little busy here . Yeah , well , whatever 's not packed , you need to leave it . It 's time to go . I 'm not going . What the hell are you talking about ? I 'm dying , Murphy . Come on . Abby said if you didn 't use your brain , we ... We 're past that now . You 're going to space ? Have any idea what it feels like to be in pain every day ? When I was spacewalking , everything was right . I just want that again . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for doing this to you , Raven . This is not your fault , Murphy . I could deal with losing my leg , but ... Losing my mind ... What do you want me to tell the others ? Tell them ... Tell them I floated myself . Go . Survive . Heh . It 's what cockroaches do , right ? Can we please get back to work ? Yeah . Yeah , ok , sorry . Right . Where were we ? The entire city is the battlefield . No time limit . No guns . One warrior from each clan fights until only one remains . And the winner 's clan takes the bunker . Just like that . Without guns and without anyone trained in grounder combat , there 's no way we can win . Hey , we fight or we die . I 'm here for the war .

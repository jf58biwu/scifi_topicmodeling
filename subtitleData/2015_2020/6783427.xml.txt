 Previously on Aftermath ... Kids , Lamar Boone , aka Booner . God , Mom . An ambush predator called Jubokko . Shit . He 's possessed . Run ! Feverheads . - How many ? - 30 , 40 . That 's right . You go on back to hell . Mom , we 're here . Sally ... shopped at a co-op . She made her own ice cream . She went all over the world , and she helped people every single day of her life . She gave that life for us . Let 's not forget it . That 's just Mount Rainier . We get it all the time . Yeah , you 'd like that . Is Mom gonna be okay ? I don 't know . Guys , come on . I 'm fine . I know , that 's the weird part . Hey , Karen , listen . - I 'm thinking that it might be wise ... - You want to go home . We have Brianna . You want to go home . - Yeah . - Yeah . - That 's what I 'm thinking . - Me too . Hey , I want you to stay . After the way the whole family fought last night , I know you 're up to it , and you 'll be safe . It 's the end of the world . Nobody 's safe . Well , if you 're gonna die , you may as well be around your friends . Nobody 's gonna die . We 're not gonna die . - You 're not gonna die . - Okay , okay . - Jesus . - But if you 're gonna leave , you need food and fuel . - You 've given us enough . - I 've got both . No , no , we 're going to Camp Keewatin . That 's where Dana was a counselor . We 're gonna get all our supplies there . Yeah , yeah , that summer that I was away . - You were always away . - Well , I was on a dig . I mean , that 's part of the job requirements . I know , honey , I know . I 'll throw in a couple extra shooters and a vehicle . - I don 't want your shooters . - Like hell you don 't . I 'm gonna get my vehicle back . What 's the matter with this guy ? Pride is a deadly sin , Booty . Take something from me for once . - She 'll take it . - I 'll take it . Where are you gonna be ? I have to go get supplies of my own . I have to go to Memphis Pacific College . It 's probably 25 miles east of here . You remember Gloria Douglas ? - The crazy professor ? - That 's right . How do you know she 's gonna be there ? No , everything she predicted has come true , and I don 't know if she 's gonna be there , but I know that they 'll have archived her work wherever she taught . So I 'll just go to the college , and I 'll meet you at the camp after . So you 're gonna go through all this danger just for some research ? Lamar , you 're helping us survive today . I 'm trying to help us survive tomorrow . You 're not going alone . Okay , I 'll take Briana and Devyn . You take Dana and Matt . Plus an additional shooter per vehicle . Come on , Booty . I got to do this . - Done . - Deal . Done . Here you go . Your boyfriend 's in the back talking to himself . - Relax , Jane , hop in . - He 's praying , Matt . Matt . Listen , you 're in charge of your mother . - She 's gonna love that . - No , no , just don 't tell her that . Just observe and react . Stay close to her . All right . Here , grab hold . Thanks . That wasn 't the best morning . You can 't dwell on these things . - Yeah , I guess . - I 'm serious . We get distracted , we die . - Got it ? - Yeah . So you keep your eye on the woods , not on me , in spite of what your father said . - How did you know ? - I know your father . Be sharp . We 're not the only ones looking for supplies out there . It 's good to get going . Of course she waited for my dad to go first so she could watch him for a while . Ooh , oops . No problem . Sorry . I don 't know what 's wrong with me . Not much , in my opinion . Godspeed , Booty . See you after the end . You 're the man , Lamar . See you , Booner . All right ! Lock it up ! All right , Dr. Douglas research is archived here . I won 't be long . Dad , how could she have predicted all this shit ? I don 't know . I thought she was crazy , but ... - I 'm going with you . - No , Dana , I want you with Bri and Devyn . All right , let 's load up as fast as we can . Where do we find things ? Bulk food in the mess hall and the kitchen . Dry goods ? Survival ? They stored that in the counselor 's cabin . - I know where that is . - Okay , go with Martin . Assume it 's a free-fire zone . Safeties off . Don 't sorry , Mrs. Copeland . I got her . Nothing bad 's ever happened to two young , - sexy kids at a camp before , right ? - Stop it . - So this was your summer camp ? - Yeah , I loved it . Dark skies . You could see the double star in Lyra , naked eye . Wow . Party girl . Well , plus I couldn 't wait to get away from my family . Seems funny to say that now . I fought with Brianna all the time . - Over ? - The important stuff . Chores and clothes . I was the only kid . I used to wish I had a brother to fight with . Well , where are your parents now ? I 'm from Seattle . I 'm sorry . Where do 3 million people go ? I don 't know . Somewhere good maybe . I never thought of that . Something to hope for . Hope is really all that 's left , I guess . - You hear anything ? - Thought I heard an engine . Someone at the camp ? Let 's say hello . Damn , it 's thick in here . Stop your bitching ! Come on , let 's go this way . Found much more ? - No , we emptied the kitchen . - Great . - There are people out there . - What people ? GRs in the woods . Two of them now , but there could be more . Where 's Dana ? I don 't know , but they 're armed . Let 's split up and find her . Put the knife on the table . Ponga el cuchillo en la mesa . Would you like some water ? Quieres agua ? Can you tell me where the restroom is ? Puedes decirme dónde está el baño ? I would like to purchase some shoe polish . Me gustaría comprar un poco de betÃºn . This concludes Conversational Spanish , lesson six . Dr. Douglas ? Gloria Douglas ? Yes . Hi . I 'm Joshua Copeland . Dr. Copeland . What brings you here ? Well , to be honest with you , I was looking for your dissertation . - Of course . - You remember me ? Sure , you 're Joshua Copeland . Yeah , from Whitstron College . I , I think I was opposed to your work when you first put it out , and I think we had some very bitter words , which I was wrong . I think your work is filled with important insights . Of course . I didn 't expect to run into you in person . I 'm glad that I have an opportunity to say I 'm sorry , ask you if I could maybe re-read your work . Well , you 're having a good day then , aren 't you ? Wow , you 're a fast stacker . Yeah , it 's one of my better qualities . It 's not my best . Okay , we are going to talk . Yeah , I think the odds on that are long . We need to find out everything about each other , and there is very little time . Okay , you first . Okay , I almost never wear makeup . Me either . But I am surprisingly good at walking in heels . Me too . I think you 're just saying anything that comes to mind in hopes of having sex with me . I would never do that . Except for right now , and any other time we 're both in the state of Washington . Or a state of undress . Sorry , sorry , that just came out . Yeah , are we really gonna do this ? Yeah , the evidence says we are , yeah . Because I just got to say , and I swear it 's the last time , I 'm a lot older than you , and I 'm your bodyguard , and ... Martin . Martin . What you are is someone I am really attracted to , and normally ... normally we would just take a beat and figure this out , but the world is probably ending . Yeah , I know , but ... And you can 't regret what you won 't live to regret . You got a point . What 's wrong ? Go away , please . I 'm back here if you need me . Did you find it yet ? - No . - Why is it so important to you ? Why ? ' Cause everything you wrote is coming true . Comets , plagues , skinwalkers , even the mythic beasts . Indeed . So if you can predict what 's gonna happen next ... Let me show you . What the hell is that ? - Where did you come from ? - I hadn 't seen you in a bit , and in Booner 's system it 's hands on every ten minutes . - Thank God for Booner . - I say it again , - what the hell is that ? - It 's a Fetch . It 's an Anglo-Saxon word for shape-shifter . I mean , they have them in every culture and every legend , but they can turn into anyone you know , and then they become murderous . At least that 's the legend . Like we don 't have enough shit already . Something else that Dr. Douglas predicted , which means if it can turn into her , then she 's in the vicinity . We have to find her . Well , this is an archive . You 'd think her address is in here somewhere . Stop tickling me . What ? Stop it . Dana ! - Hold on ! - Help ! Help me ! Get it off ! Get off ! Please ! Almost ! Almost ! Get it off ! Go on ! Go , go ! Go , go , go ! Come on . Shit , I left my gun . Don 't bother . We got the only ones you 'll need . What are you all doing here ? This is our camp , okay ? And we don 't like uninvited guests . Look , we don 't know you guys and you don 't know us , but I need to warn you . Dana , don 't . I have to . That vine around your leg , there 's a killer plant underneath that cabin , and it 's gonna pull you underground and eat you . Nice try . - Jessie , it 's got me ! - Let 's get out of here ! Help me , Jessie ! It 's got me ! Help ! It 's eating me ! Kill me ! What the hell ? - That was Jess . I know her voice . - Okay , let 's go . Do you really have to listen to that ? There 's nothing else on . Well , hep talk from the '50s isn 't gonna help us . Well , it can 't hurt . Water above and fire below , the next wave 's got a bubbling glow , and the next precip is some kind of tip with hot rocks from deeper down the roads . Won 't be rain when it explodes , it 'll be Rainier if you 'll pardon my eruption . - Mount Rainier ? - And what happens when the underground leaves dark behind and burns out bright ? I don 't think this thing blows tonight , but soon , aficionados , soon . Is he talking about Mount Rainier erupting ? I don 't know what he 's talking about . I just like the sound . The only address they have for her is here at this college . She must have had her mail forwarded . Maybe she lives here , like that shape-shifter thing . Why don 't you check this building , I 'll check the residences , and meet back here ? Let 's go . Mom ! Don 't do that to me . I heard screaming and gunfire . I couldn 't find her . It 's not Dana , she 's still here . Let 's stick together , scour the place . Try not to get shot . No , no , no , no . It ate ... It ate her . We got to get out of here . Who ate what ? The monster in this building , it ate her . - Did you see the looters ? - Two . We had them cornered , and then they told us about the monster , and then it took Roz . Maybe they set a trap . Yeah , with the monster they carry around . Look , I don 't know who these people are , but they have to answer for Roz . Let 's find them . We can 't just hide in the woods . Hey , hey , they 're looking for us . I 'm unarmed , and we don 't know how many we 're facing . But Mom and Matt ... Have better odds if we don 't lead hostiles right to them . What if ... what if they find Mom on their own ? Then ... I pity the fool . Hey , it 's gonna be okay . I know . Come on , let 's go . Gloria ? Is it Gloria Douglas ? Dr. Douglas ? Joshua Copeland . - Yes . - It 's me . Trust you to get past the shape-shifter . Was that a Fetch ? That 's the Anglo-Saxon version . I prefer to use the Filipino word : Aswang . Kind of reminds me of you somehow , Aswang . Y los demonios va a surgir . And the sun will darken , and the demons will emerge . Well , since we 're gonna die soon , let 's say we have a drink . Relax , the bourbon is on the table . How did you know about the Fetch ? We call it an Aswang . Do not be such a WASP about every little thing , Josh . I 'll get it . I was at my office last week doing some work , and the thing came slithering in . I think ... I think it might be some kind of virus . So they touch a crumb , a DNA , and they can use it to replicate , and there they are . Or there you are . I even trained my Aswang to kill anybody who came looking for me . You trained a shape-shifter ? Just got to be smarter than the virus , Josh . How did you know ? How did you know all these things would appear ? You wrote about them even in your early work . You mean the work that you used to ruin me ? That 's what you want to discuss right now in the last hours of your life ? The last hours of my life ? There 've been 2,200 little earthquakes over the last 24 hours . - It 's called a swarm . - I don 't feel anything . That 's because they stopped this morning , and that 's a very bad thing , Josh . This lovely institution lies in the shadow of Mount Rainier , and you know what that means ? That means that all those little micro-vents , when the quakes happen , they ... they close . And when every single vent gets shut tight , pressure starts to build , and therefore what happens ? What happens when that happens ? Boom . Boom ? Boom . When ? I don 't know . Sometime less than the next 12 hours and more than the next 30 seconds , say . I presume you want to leave now . No , I don 't . I want to discuss your work . You mean the work that you blackballed me with ? All right . I 'm truly sorry for the part that I played in that . I , you know , I didn 't realize , obviously . Fine . You 're in luck ' cause I 'm lonely . The only thing worse than being lonely is being right and nobody knows it . - Except me . - Yeah , except you . You 're all I got . Listen , I have to ask you something . I heard these broadcasts . Seems like they 're from decades ago , but I 'm starting to think he 's talking about current events . Josh , you 're gonna have to give up on all these quaint , little ideas . Time and space , it 's not all that it 's cracked up to be . Maybe this guy just knows things before they happen , like me . Don 't you know things before they happen , Josh ? Yeah , some things I know , but ... Do you want me to tell you ? Yes . Okay , I will . Did you ever learn how to surf ? No , why ? It would be useful to ride the waves . - But what waves ? - Those waves , idiot . Those waves . Those are the waves that are making things happen , that are hitting us , that are smashing us to bits . What kind of waves ? I don 't know . They 're ... it 's a physics thing . Really it 's , I don 't know , gravity or magnetic , or ... My God , I 'm so tired . Well , that 's all I got . It 's a wave . Can we do anything to stop it ? If I could stop it , would I be camped out in this archive getting drunk every day ? How about another ? This is where the camp counselors would come to make out . Including you ? Yeah , with Marquise . Who 's he ? Beautiful eyes . Big teeth . I like a guy with big teeth , okay ? How are mine ? You have other qualities . Come here . There ain 't no monsters . It 's something else . Something else like what ? Will you two just zip it and keep your eyes open ? - You see any tracks ? - Nothing yet . They got to be around here somewhere . We 'll find them . So this , this wave , is it ... Does that control everything ? That is such a male thing to say , controlled . No , of course the wave doesn 't control anything . It 's like a man . It doesn 't have a mind . It 's just a thing that causes other things to happen . - Okay . - Are you married ? - Yes . - I 'm not married . I knew too much . You 're learning Spanish . It 's a bit late in the game , I have to admit . It 's a Spanish mystic , Bartolomé . He died about 1,000 years ago , and it was reading his stuff that led me to investigate all this other stuff . Yeah , did he predict these events ? No , but he probably would have if he hadn 't been burned at the stake . So things described in end-time prophesies from dozens of different cultures are suddenly becoming real . It 's the damnedest thing , isn 't it ? So did this mystic , did he have some insight into what 's gonna happen next ? Sure , and it would kill every drop of hope you have . There 's always hope . What did he say ? He said , " Everything ends forever . " Did I happen to mention that Mount Rainier 's gonna blow ? The most violent volcano in the world , and we 're sitting right on top of it . Yeah , well , Yellowstone Caldera 's on top of ... If I 'd meant Caldera , I would have said Caldera . It is the most dangerous volcano in the world , and we are sitting right on top of it . Plus , get this , the big headed dopes that built this archive put it right on top of this immense lava vent . So Bob Black 's broadcasts , they 're real . They 're happening in real time . He 's describing what 's really happening . He 's describing Mount Rainier . So we need to get out of here . You go . I 'm gonna stay . Why is that ? Because ... I 'm trying to kill myself . I want to kill myself , and I can 't do it , so I 'm gonna let the volcano do it for me . Look at me . I want to get out of here . I know , me too . Devyn , I promised Jane we 'd stay in ... Devyn . Devyn . Devyn ! Devyn , what are you doing ? Nothing . Just go away and I can do it . Do what ? Devyn , where are you ? Where the hell are you ? Devyn , talk to me . Devyn , I can tell you 're moving . Devyn , come out . My God . My God . I told you not to look . Devyn , don 't do this , please . I have to . Why ? I don 't want to hurt you . Devyn , if you pull that trigger , I won 't recover for the rest of my life . All right ? If you don 't want to hurt me , you put the gun down , we walk out of here , and things will get better , I promise you , all right ? You give me the gun . Devyn , give me the gun . If you love me , you will give me the gun . Give it to me . You 're so stupid . Don 't you ever scare me like that again . I love you so much . - Stop right there ! - Drop the weapons . All right , bitches , drop them ! I said drop it ! Drop it ! - Drop it ! - Hey , hey ! - You stole our food . - I didn 't know it was yours . - I don 't care . - Where are the others ? - What others ? - The ones who were there - when my friend died . - What friend ? Tell us , or studly here gets it . - Let us go and you won 't die . - You got that backwards . We 're here with soldiers . Better trained than you . We don 't meet them in 15 minutes , they 're gonna blow your heads off . Bullshit . They 're Army Rangers . They 're trained to track . You 're wearing their favorite color . I 'm your only way out . Here 's the deal . You take us to the truck . We let you live . We split the food . - I need to read your work . - Too late . Yesterday I decided I didn 't have the guts to die in lava , so you know what I did ? I took a little drive into town , went to the local hardware store , liberated some high explosives , and the whole building is wired . I 'm gonna die with my work . Why would you do that ? Why wouldn 't you want to save people ? Save , save , save ? No one is saved , asshole . It 's the apocalypse . You think things are bad now ? They 're just gonna get much , much worse . I 'm gonna die right here . - Gloria , it 's not too late . - Thankfully , it is too late . Listen , I just ... I need to know how you did that . I need to know how you predicted that . I don 't know . I need to know what process you used . I don 't have a method . All of a sudden I just knew everything . Why ? You have to know why ? Yes , of course , of course ! I think I 'm part of the wave . I think the wave is using me , and I can 't stand myself . All right , so if there 's a cause then it 's not random , then there 's a purpose , and then life has meaning , and then there 's ... Of course life has meaning . It 's just not good . All right , you want me to help you ? There 's ... there 's a piece of my research out there . It 's in a nice , little box ... - Right . - In plain sight . You find it . You understand it . Maybe it helps you . And you have one minute till the building blows up . I don 't believe you . 58 seconds . 56 seconds . You I 'm gonna miss . We had a deal . I don 't hear any soldiers . That 's why they train . Think you can die quietly ? Well , that 's pretty cocky for a slack-ass , barnyard bitch . Back off , soldier boy . You know how this goes . Here 's the deal . I 'll let you keep the food if you tell me where the others are . Clock 's ticking , Josh . Getting warmer . Computer cards . Tick , tick , tick . Time 's a-wasting . - I want my daughter . - What daughter ? The girl you saw with the soldier . Hell . We offed that tasty little slice and her boyfriend . No , please , no ! No ! Please , God . - Where 's my daughter ? - Please , please , please , no ! You son of a bitch . Mom . Dana . What have you done ? They told me you were dead . So you killed them ? Honey . Don 't touch me . Who are you ? It 's me . Open up . Dad ? It 's Dad . Why didn 't you bring your keys ? I was getting worried . Did you find the papers ? And where 's Jane ? Sorry I 'm cranky . I 've had a shitty day . Dad . Dad . Dad ! Dad ! Dad , don 't ! Daddy ! Daddy don 't do it ! Please ! Don 't ! Don 't ! Brianna ! Are you okay ? - You 're safe now . - It wasn 't him . - It wasn 't him . - You 're safe now . It wasn 't him . There 's no bomb ? I 'm a kidder . But I 'm ... I 'm not kidding about being afraid . I am afraid of volcanoes . I 'm afraid of bombs . So I want you to do it . You have to kill me . I 'm not gonna kill you . Why not ? You killed me once already . You 're good at it . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You know , when you and your little boyfriends in academia were done with me , I couldn 't get a job anywhere . I end up at Memphis Pacific College . Are you kidding me ? Memphis is nowhere near the Pacific . I look like an idiot . I should have gone to Princeton . I should have been famous . I 'm the one who knew everything , and look where I end up : in this shithole with no publications , and no kids and no hope . So you owe me . Okay , just do it , and take the computer cards . They 're all you need to understand this whole thing . Now shoot me . Well , I can 't use the computer cards without a reader . Wait a second . Shoot me . I 'm not gonna shoot you . Come with me . - Shoot me . - Join us . - We have a room . - Just shoot me . - I can make you safe . - Shoot me , Josh . - You can travel with us . - Just shoot me ! I 'm not gonna shoot you ! Wow . Thank you . When someone asks you to do that , you do it , okay ? The thing about end of times is that people know what they want . Listen to the voices in the night , Josh . What 's wrong ? Big day , Dad . Big day . Hi . What happened ? We got what we needed . And the bodies on the ground ? They got what they needed . Yeah , they would have killed us if we hadn 't made a move . Okay . Matt , you got to tell him . They were GRs . The worst I 've seen . They threatened us . They taunted Mom . I mean , they told her Dana was dead . That 's ... that 's gonna do it . The last one she shot over and over . It must have been 20 times . She just lost it . - I 'm sorry . - No , it 's my fault . I should have been around here . There 's nothing you could have done about it , so ... What about Dana ? She fought off a Jubokko . Well , then she gets to smoke . - What 's going on with Devyn ? - I 'll handle it . Hoo , hoo , hoo ! Dev ! Dev , stop . - I saw it . - Stay away from me . I saw the skinwalker . Then you know I 'm going to kill you . If you saw it , you know . You know it 's true . No , you won 't . You don 't hurt the people you love . But you don 't love me . Look at me . Look at me . I love you , okay ? I mean it , I do , but you ... You cannot flip out on me , all right ? They will kill you . You have to understand that . You won 't last . I tried to fight it , Brianna . I have , and I can 't anymore . Yes , you can , Devyn . You can fight it . Love is stronger than anything . It 's not stronger than this . You 're a good person , okay ? I 'm gonna help you . I love you so much . He 's making me do this because he knows how much I love you . I won 't let you have the boy . Devyn , no . Please ! Please . Hey , hey ! Devyn , don 't ! Please ! Please don 't do it ! Please ! Please ! Devyn ! Please . Please don 't do this . Devyn don 't do this , please . You were right . Love is stronger , Brianna . Please .

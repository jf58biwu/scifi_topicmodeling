 [ narrator ] previously on dark matter . [ three ] who are you ? [ both ] i don 't know . Who are you ? I got no idea . [ one ] we all woke up just like you no idea who we are Or how we got here . [ two ] she 's an android . [ the android ] we 're on course for a nearby inhabited world . [ mireille ] well you 're welcome to resupply And help yourself to whatever you need then you best be off . [ six ] why is that ? You wanna be long gone before the raza get here . The raza ? Obviously we were meant to help these people . The raza is the name of this ship . We 're not here to help these people . We 're here to kill them . No . That 's impossible . That can 't be right . Can it ? [ android ] i recovered the information from A fragment of the ship 's logs related to the crew list . There 's no reason to doubt its veracity . [ two ] of course not . In fact , it all makes perfect sense now The raza- - This ship . But as far as the miners are concerned : A race of bloodthirsty aliens- - monsters , come to wipe them out . [ six ] but truth is we 're nothing but a bunch of low-life mercenaries . [ three ] no , we 're better than that . We 're also pirates and smugglers and thieves , It 's a very diversified portfolio . You think this is funny ? It 's my defense mechanism : Humor . That and , apparently , killing people . I think we need to talk about our next move . Well he 's right you know . Oh listen i don 't wanna be the one to say it , But if all this stuff is true , we came here to do a job . You want to go down to the planet and kill those people ? No one 's killing anyone . [ three ] i didn 't say i wanted to kill anyone . I 'm just talking about the people who hired us . Ferrous corp.Oration. Galactic combine . Exactly . Not the sort of folks you wanna disappoint , i 'm guessing . Too bad . I 'm no murderer . [ three ] it 's funny cause the screen says otherwise . Yeah , i don 't care what it says . So have you managed to uncover anything else ? Unfortunately , the rest of the data was corrupted . Well , i suppose that 's plenty . Hell of a lot more than i wanted to know anyways . [ four ] we all wanted to know . These are the memories we left behind , Death , despair , chaos . So what ? If they 're no longer a part of us now Then what does it even matter ? Yeah . Should i continue my attempts at data recovery ? Portia ? Don 't ... Don 't call me that . No computer file is going to tell me who i am . Call me two . Okay two . ¶ music playing ¶ [ das / five gasps ] [ android ] i 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to startle you . You didn 't startle me . You scared the crap out of me sneaking up like that . My stealth subroutines are very efficient . Well dial them back- - Or say something next time you walk into a room . [ android ] are you afraid of them now ? [ das ] you think i should be ? They show a history of violence , mental instability , Extreme anti-social behavior , deceit- - What 's important is who they are now . An admirable attitude . Also , potentially a very foolish and dangerous one . Hey , you 're the one who tried to kill us . The result of a programmed directive That has since been deleted . Same with them maybe , right ? If it 's not fear , then why are you upset ? What makes you think i 'm upset ? I can see a muscular tension in your jaw and shoulders . I can hear a slight increase In both respiratory rate and heart rate . I can smell a distinct shift in pheromone production- - Okay , okay . I get it . Look , if you want to know It 's because i 'm the only one who 's not in the files . I 'm not one of the crew . So ... How did i get onboard this ship ? At least they know they belong here . I 'm still just a big question mark . [ das / five sighs ] There may come a time when you 'll consider yourself lucky Not to be counted as a member of this crew . Well right now , i just wish i was part of the team . Oh , and one more thing , maybe don 't go around telling people You can smell their pheromones . It 's not gonna win you any friends . But i can smell them . [ six ] weapons array , sensors , Navigation and critical controls . Flip these , punch that , hit these two And you bring the engines online . [ three ] how do you know how to fly this thing ? I don 't know , i just do . Huh . Maybe you do too . You gotta try it . [ straining ] yep ... Wait a minute ... That 's it . [ air decompressing ] [ alarm sounding ] Oh ... No , no , no . Maybe not . [ sighs in frustration ] You know i just can 't concentrate This whole thing 's got me thinking , that 's all . Yeah , tell me about it . Which one of us do you think 's got the baddest rep ? What ? Yeah i mean , just based on what we know about each other , Which is not a lot to go on i know , How would you rank us in order of most wanted , From like " super bad-ass " all the way on down To " cause for concern . " For instance , i 'd put me in first spot , You 'd slide right there in seco . Boss lady well she 'd be third on account of her ba 'ttitude And then ol ' slashy stabberson . Pretty boy and the kid tied for last place Cause it looks like she 's got a bit of a temper . You being serious ? You 'd rate her higher ? Yeah ... Maybe . This doesn 't bother you at all ? What ? The fact that we 're wanted criminals ? That if we get caught we 'll spend the rest of our lives Locked away , if we 're lucky ? The fact that from hereon in , We 'll be the targets of our former victims Their friends loved ones and anyone else looking To cash in on our bounties , none of whom , by the way , We 'll see coming because we don 't remember A thing past yesterday . Not really . No-no-no-no-no-no . Don 't-don 't-don 't don 't . I 've been thinking ... Yeah , that 's something you need to get under control . Those weapons in the cargo hold , The matching pendants , at first , i thought it meant We were the ones who were supposed to help the miners- - That we were their saviors . But now i 'm wondering if it means we killed their saviors And heisted the delivery . Your point ? If i 'm right , ferrous corp .. Isn 't gonna let this go . If we don 't finish the job , they 'll just send someone else . Which is why we stick to the plan . The miners get half the weapons , and a fighting chance . We can do more . Go all the way . Commit to something . We can fight with them . That would be suicide . Not necessarily . Look if half of what 's in those files is true , Then we can handle ourselves . It also means you could spend the rest of your life Doing good deeds and not even come close to making up for it . I know what you 're trying to do , and it 's not going to work . You don 't want to believe what those files say you are , fair e . I don 't much want to either . But i 'm not gonna kill myself Trying to make up for crimes i don 't even remember committing . We stick to the plan . And who made you team leader ? I did by stepping up . And so did all of you by not challenging me when i did . Unless ... Unless you 've had a change of heart And think you can do a better job ? Didn 't think so . [ jace corso / one sighs ] [ six ] try that , is it on ? [ one ] yeah . [ six ] okay . [ three ] seriously ... [ four ] yeah ? ... What 's with the sword ? It 's quicker , more effective in close quarter combat . More effective than a gun ? Without a doubt . You think you could outdraw me with that thing ? I would have your head cut off before you could even unholster . Hey . I need to talk to you . Ohh . [ two ] look , i may have been a little hard on you before . Believe me , i know how you feel . We all do . But 10 minutes after finding out you used to be a villain Is not the time to try to be a hero . There is no room for independent action . We need to stick together and watch each others ' backs . Do you understand what i 'm saying ? I ... Think so . Once the weapons are delivered and that shuttle comes back , I want you on it . Understood ? Yeah . Alright . Safe flight . And stop staring at my ass . [ mireille ] hey , i 'm sorry we couldn 't do more for you . It 's just we gave everything we had to hrothgar . [ one ] don 't worry about it . Well , what are you gonna tell your employer ? I mean how are you going to explain- - Intergalactic transport 's a risky business . Cargo gets misplaced or stolen all the time . Insurance 'll cover it . You 're good people . No , we 're not . Of course you are . You 've helped us- - i mean you probably saved our lives . I 'm beginning to think it 's just the opposite . By giving you these weapons , I 'm afraid we 're just giving you false hope . Look ... You can 't win this . If you stay here and fight , you 'll die . But i 'm hoping it 's not gonna come to that . We have help coming , and more weapons . [ three ] that 's the spirit . Don 't let the bastards get you down . As for us , we gotta get back to our spaceship . [ woman ] not yet . At least allow us to thank you . That bloodthirsty look in your eyes is all the thanks . With song and drink ! Well , who doesn 't love a good song huh ? Oh ! Well . [ keypad beeping ] [ five ] oh , hey . I took another look at that console on the bridge , But i think it 's really fried . At least until we can get some spare parts . Sorry . Yeah that 's okay . Hey , can i ask you something ? I know you didn 't exactly Get the answers you were looking for , But if you could go back to when we first woke up , And not know , would you ? [ two sighs heavily ] I suppose i might . But i have a feeling that not knowing would just make me Want to know all over again . Well , i guess the next big mystery that needs solving Is who stole our memories . No one stole our memories . It was an accident . No it wasn 't . [ android ] two , you need to come to the bridge immediate . [ two sighs ] what is it ? Another ship . It 's just dropped out of ftl . Who is it ? Ferrous corp.Oration destroyer . They 've already launched a shuttle . It 's headed towards the planet 's surface . We 've got to get our people off that planet . Did you contact the marauder and warn them ? I attempted communication but received no response . Shit . [ communication device beeping ] We 're being hailed by the other ship . Would you like me to- - ? Ignore it . Marauder , this is the raza . You 've got trouble headed your way . [ radio static ] [ two ] marauder , do you read ? [ radio static continues ] [ drinks clanking ] [ marcus boone / threel laughing ] [ cheering ] We drink their drink , eat their food , And then just ... Leave them here to die . [ six ] hey , if you 've got another suggestion That doesn 't involve us dying here with them , i 'd love to hea . Maybe we should tell them the truth . What that we 're mercenaries sent here to kill them ? They should know that no more help is coming . It won 't make a difference . Maybe not . But we might . Don 't even think about it . We 're very , very bad people who 've some very bad things , This is our chance to put our unique skill set to good us . We stand alongside these miners and , when ferrous corp . Comes , We hurt them , hurt them so bad They think twice about bothering with this planet . [ griffin jones / six chuckles ] [ one ] what ? ! You 're nothing if not predictable . Two told me you 'd say all of th , practically word for word . She also said to do whatever it takes To bring you back with us , Including knocking you out and dragging you back if i have . Really ? She did ask me not to hit you in the face though . [ thomas ] ferrous corp . Is here ! Ferrous corp . Is here ! Go , go ! Hey ! Marauder , this is the raza . Are you there ? We might consider the possibility that they 've already Encountered the ferrous corp . Shuttle . Patch me through to the destroyer . Done . This is the raza . Please , respond . This is the raza . Please respond . This is commander nieman of the fcs deliverance . Took you long enough . Apologies . What can i do for you , commander ? Well you can start by telling me what the hell is going on ? Why you didn 't complete your mission Or update us on your status ? There were some complications we had to contend with But we have everything under control now . Please have your shuttle fall b . Negative , raza . Contingency plans have been ena . Again , that won 't be necessary , deliverance . This is our show . Not anymore it 's not . Raza , i 'm on my way over . [ warning gun fire ] [ nassan ] that 's far enough ! [ guns click ] [ man ] is that any way to act , After ferrous corp . Made you such a generous offer ? ! Generous ? ! You 'd turn us into slaves on our own land ! One last chance to reconsider ! [ one ] whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hold on ! Hold on ! Hold on , please ! Hold up . No one wants a fight here . You had a job to do , corso . [ jace corso / one panting ] Well , we took some time to think things through And decided on a change of plan . Take your men and leave . Tell your bosses we 're with these people now . You can 't be serious . What did they offer you ? You know us . You know what we 're capable of . Think of the losses . It 's not worth it . Find another planet . It 's not my call . I 'll have to take this upstairs . Fair enough . [ semi-automatic guns firing ] rat-tat-tat-tat [ man painfully yelps ] ( guns firing ) [ shotgun blasts ] bam-bam-bam We 're under fire ! I repeat , we 're under fire ! The mercs have turned , they 're with the miners now ! We need back up ! Shut the hell up . That actually went better than i thought it would . [ android ] the shuttle is approaching . Go . Hide . And don 't come out until we tell you it 's safe . Go ! The shuttle is within weapons range . We have an advantage with speed and maneuverability . But this ship is still far from fully operational . Welcome aboard . [ nassan ] hey , you 're gonna be fine , here . [ mirelle ] okay . You have medical training ? [ six ] uh , yeah ... I guess so . That 's great . We could really use your expertise . [ three ] nope . We can 't stay . [ one ] of course we can . Just long enough to help the injured . We 're leavin right now . You selfish son-of-a- - [ six ] he 's right . It 's a long hike back to the marauder And there could be more of them out there . Wait a minute , you 're going to abandon us ? You got your weapons , staying was never part of the d . Neither was killing those soldiers . But now you 're just going to leave us here To deal with the fallout ! Friend , the fallout would 've been so much worse If we hadn 't been here so ... You 're welcome . Please , i mean you 've got a shuttle- - a ship . [ one ] that 's right . And they 're at your disposal if any of you want to leave . Look you stood , you made your point . But now it 's time to go . This is a war you can 't win . Please . You 're all a bunch of cowards . All of you . Hagen , that 's enough . This is our battle We can 't expect anyone else to fight it for us . These men risked their lives , Offered more than we had any right to expect of them . We have help coming . When it gets here , we 'll be fin . We appreciate all you 've done for us . Good luck . [ das / five panting ] [ clicks ] [ android ] so ... Do either of you possess offspring ? [ nieman ] you were hired to do a job . [ two ] like i said , complications arose . And continue to do so apparently . On my way over , I received word that we suffered casualties on the plant Yeah well i 'm sorry to hear that - - And that your team was responsible . Ours is a cutthroat business . In this sector alone we 're competing With six other multicorp.S for planetary resources . Our major rival , the mikkei combine , Have been particularly aggressive . The discovery of that tarium vein is a major coup- - One the company seeks to start exploiting immediately . That planet is the only hospitable world in range . Then maybe you should 've started with the fair offer Instead of trying to bully the miners into submission . I didn 't come here to talk about what we can do for them . I came here to discuss what we could do for you . I 'm listening . You took payment in advance , And then failed to complete the job . That 's bad business . Lucky for you i 'm feeling generous today . I 'm willing to call it even . In exchange for ? Turn this ship around and leave immediately . That 's it ? Just walk away ? What 's about to happen on that planet- - Well , it would be better if there were no witnesses . I still have people down there . They made their choice . They opened fire on ferrous corp . Personnel , They have to answer for that . I suggest you don 't make the same mistake . If it makes it easier , i 'm willing to throw in a bonus . ... Just for you . How much ? Let 's get the hell off this roc . Uh , we 've got a problem . What ? The ship ... It 's not there . What do you mean " it 's not there " ? I 'm telling you , it 's not there . The raza 's gone . [ thomas ] i am so sorry . We lead you into this . If you hadn 't taken the time to give us those weapons , You 'd never been caught down here . We wanted to help . Still do . This isn 't your fight . It is now . Well , i can 't tell a man how to live his life , I 'm not gonna tell him how to end it . Okay we could use some fresh eyes on the perimete . Patrol 's growing mighty thin . We have no way to anticipate when or where This next attack will come . Maybe there is . [ door creaks open ] Double-crossing us was a big mistake . You and your friends are gonna die . How ? Tell me . How are we going to die ? Choking on your own blood . Could you be more specific ? We 're gonna line you up and shoot the lucky ones . The rest , like you , we 'll gut . No . That 's not it . You could have done that from the beginning . Stormed this facility , execute everyone in it . You have the men ; the resources . But you didn 't . You hired us to do your dirty work instead . Plausible deniability . A mining colony wiped out by mercenaries , That 's unfortunate , but it 's not surprising . A mining colony wiped out by a corp.Oration. Well , that 's scandalous . We can make a deal- - You want the miners gone , Without being directly implicated in their deaths . And you wouldn 't be here unless You had a plan to make that hap . If you let me go i can guarantee your safety . Look , i don 't know anything . You were neither briefed nor given orders ? Just transported down here to the planet And expected to improvise ? I can tell you from experience , torture doesn 't work . Torture is often ineffective , even counter-productive . On the other hand , i personally find it incredibly cathartic . [ one ] that could work . Of course it could work ... Righ . They plan to target your reactor , Trigger a blast that will level this entire facility . [ thomas ] it 's a mark four fusion reactor . Standard equipment for a mining community About 50 years ago . Nowadays we can hardly find spare parts to keep it running . [ one ] it 's the perfect cover : Outdated technology , Ill-equipped miners who don 't know what they 're doi . It 's an accident waiting to happen . We 'll never be able to hold this position . Not for long , anyways . At least we 'll die fighting . ¶ rock music ¶ ¶ rock music ¶ ¶ rock music ¶ [ one ] how we looking keeley ? [ keeley ] clear skies . Good . Keep us updated . What 's up ? Hey . I 've been thinking . Yeah ? You 're right . Which one of us ? Both of you . We 're doomed . Nah , hang on a second . As much as i 'd love to tell you " i told you so , " i don 't know . I kinda like our chances here guys . It doesn 't matter how good our defenses are . At the end of the day , They got an endless supply of bodies and bullets . We don 't . Eventually , they 'll wear us dow . Okay , and what was i right about ? There might be a way to win thi , but it 's a long shot . Like you said , we 've got to hit them where it hurts most : Their bottom line . Which is what we 're doing here . No . Ferrous corp . Doesn 't care about their men . They 'll just get more . Ships , on the other hand , are a lot harder to come by . And a hell of a lot more expensive . You saying we take out their ship ? Yeah . Oh man . Well i like the idea in theory , but it begs the question : How do we get it down here ? We don 't . We go up there after it . Or i do anyway , in the marauder . I 'll target their drive and that should do it . Set off a chain of secondary explosions That 'll rip that ship apart . And you with it . Maybe not . If i punch the marauder 's engine And get clear of the blast radius- - [ one ] that 's crazy . They 'll take you down before you 're anywhere near the . Oh they can try . No . We stand together and we die together . We can 't let you do this . What ? Hear the guy out . [ six ] i know you don 't like it , believe me , i like it even less . We show we 're crazy enough to take out one of their ships , Ferrous corp . Will be less incld To risk another one around here . Think about it , you know i 'm right . I regret that i didn 't have the opportunity To get to know you better . I think we could have been good friends . Bet you regret not teaching me how to fly that shuttle now huh . [ three and six laughing ] Do i ever . Take care of them . You 're the only one on that ship with a lick of sense . If we help you , can you guarantee our safety ? It 's bubba time . Who 's bubba ? [ three setting up gun ] this is bubba . [ gun charging up ] What you don 't name your guns ? No . Ah well this is bubba , this is lulu , other one 's pip . What do you name the knife you keep in your boot ? I don 't need a knife in my boot . What do you think i am ... Psych ? [ pressing maurader controls ] [ clicking maurader controls ] [ gun clicks ] [ hagen ] step away from the console . Easy , friend . You were gonna leave us here to die weren 't you . No . I can save us all , if you let me . You 're a liar . You and your friends can 't save us . [ ferrous corp .. Soldier ] of course he can 't . I 'm the only one who can save you now . [ keeley ] this is keeley , come in ! What 's happening out there ? Two ferrous corp .. Shuttles just touched down ! He didn 't make it . We 'll hold them back as long as we can ! Keeley , listen to me . If you 're in danger of being overrun , You need to fall back to the reactor room . Keeley ? ! ¶ intense music ¶ [ semi-automatic gunfire ] rat-tat-tat-tat Game on .

Hey ! Hey ! Stand down , now ! Or i execute your friend . What do you think ? I think he 's gonna kill him anyway . Yeah . They 're powering weapons . Shields . [ weapons launching ] boom-boom-boom They 've arrived . Deliverance , this is the raza . I 'm in the company of two cruiser class vessels Under the flag of the mikkei combine . [ nieman ] raza , what the hell is this ? You 're outnumbered . Stand down or face the consequences . Blaze of glory ? Ah , what the hell ? One , two , ahhhh ! [ six ] ahhhh ! They 're gone . We did it . We did it ! Commander nieman , allow me to introduce Commanders sakey and truffault of the mcs sujin and murakami . How dare you interject yourselves Into a private dispute ? Well it 's a good thing we did , For the sake of those poor miners . We were responding to an unprovoked attack- - Irrelevant . That planet and its inhabitants now fall under the protectorate Of the mikkei combine , Meaning , you and your troops are in violation of galactic charter . This planet is an independent mining colony . Not anymore it 's not . We had a deal ! I got a better offer . I 'm sorry about nassan . He was a good leader . I-i don 't really know what we 're gonna do without him . Someone else will step up . Yeah . But you know we could- - we could use some extra help . Look i know it 's not glamorous , And i know it 's not like being among the stars but ... You know , there are some things down here that aren 't so bad . Yeah , i can see that . I just i think it 's nice to have a place Where you know you belong . I know . For me right now , i think that place is up on that ship . [ six ] hey . Lets go ! Good luck . You too . I knew ferrous corp . Wasn 't the only player in the galaxy So , after we jumped , i had the android plot a course To the nearest mikkei outpost . Once there , i took the liberty of making a deal On the miners ' behalf . How much is mikkei paying ? Nothing . I gave them a 99 year lease for free . [ six scoffs ] how the hell does that help the miners ? They 'll never agree to that . They already have . They 're signing the deal as we speak . See , their mistake was trying to negotiate with one combine . The only way to handle these bastards Is to play them against each other . It 's a stalemate . The planet is worthless without the rights to the asteroid belt , And the asteroid belt is worthless Without the rights to the planet . For the price of filing some legal papers , Mikkei gets to screw a major rival out of a big scor . And if ferrous ever caves and offers them some kind Of revenue sharing deal , the miners get 20 percent . I 'm sorry i didn 't get a chance to tell you before But i couldn 't chance an intercept Of ship-to-surface communication . Ah , we weren 't worried . I had a feeling you 'd come back for us . Mhmm . Okay . So what 's next ? Well , nearest space station is a couple of days out . We head there , refuel , resupply , and then decide . In the meanwhile , we can spend some quality time Getting to know each other . Sweet . [ footsteps ] [ two knocking ] [ two ] am i interrupting ? [ five ] no . I 'm just drawing . Can i ask you a question ? Sure . Earlier today , you said someone Was responsible for wiping our memories . Un huh . Why do you think that ? I don 't think ... I know . And how do you know ? I remember . Remember what , exactly ? [ five ] waking up in the middle of the night And uploading the program into the stasis core . Planting the virus while everyone else was sleeping . [ two ] you remember doing this ? [ five ] no , not me . It was someone else . [ two ] who ? [ three ] grunting and banging ] [ five ] it 's like i 'm remembering it for them . [ two ] and do you remember why this person wiped our memories ? Yeah . Because we 're dangerous .

 SARAH : Clones . PAUL : Genetic Identicals . SARAH : Yeah , we counted nine of us so far . ( SCREAMS ) When Beth died , I took her identity . You 're her monitor . You observe her and she killed herself because the man that she loved turned her whole life into a lie . Who the hell is Maggie Chen ? SARAH : That 's the woman Beth shot . A Neolution gives us the opportunity at self-directed evolution . NEALON : Wherever you think the science is at , I guarantee you 're wrong . - ( GRUNTING ) - ( CHOKING ) SARAH : They haven 't just infiltrated LEDA , they run CASTOR too . Both projects . I hate Neolutionists . I assume you have a plan to hide your dear mum . - We might . - FERDINAND : Good . Far away . I don 't need to know where . ( GROANS ) ( TWIG BREAKS ) ( GASPS AND WHIMPERS ) ( INHALES ) ( PANTING ) ( CELL PHONE VIBRATING ) ( EXHALES LOUDLY ) - Hello ? - WOMAN : ( WHISPERING ) I saw them . The Cheek Choppers . - MK ? - ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) - Follow the coordinates . - What ? Remember , don 't trust anyone next to you . Beth ? - Who 's that ? - ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) No one . ( SIGHS ) ( BETH SIGHS ) ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) What is this ? You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . ( SNORTING ) Sorry , tip from a source . What time will I see you later ? Why ? I wanna make you dinner . You 're being a cop in your own bedroom again . Yeah , it 's a problem . ( SIGHS ) But dinner would be nice , yeah . Go easy out there . ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) ( SIGHS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER ) ART : The call came in the middle of the night ? What kind of anonymous tip brings you all the way out here ? Hell if I know . ART : Think it 's one of your CI 's ? BETH : Uh , I didn 't recognize his voice . ART : Did you get any sleep at all ? You look like shit . - BECKWITH : Hey . - Hey . - Hey . - Body bag ? BECKWITH : Tidy , huh ? Of a brand widely used by mortuary and emergency services . - Shall we open our present ? - BOTH : Yeah . Okay , well that 's cheeky . Cause of death ... I 'd have to go with exploding cigar . - ( CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ) - Good , case closed . BECKWITH : Huh . - That 's mildly interesting . - Wait a minute , just one ? Yeah . ( SIGHS ) Ink . Thanks , gorgeous . We just wanna know your name . ( SCOFFS ) Well , damn . You ever seen one of those before ? Surgically bifurcated penis . - He did that to himself ? - Mmm-hmm . But I don 't see any advantage to that . Perhaps it 's a statement of masculine / feminine duality , Arthur . No , it isn 't . BETH : Okay , so our guy 's into body mod , so is that what the cheek 's about ? Well , the cheek 's been rather skillfully removed but I see signs of a struggle . - Hey Janis , can you ... - Yeah . His good side . ( BETH SIGHS ) ( SHUTTER CLICKS ) ART : Got footprints . Two sets coming in . One size small , one size giant . Big one does all the heavy lifting ? The smaller one 's a woman , maybe ? Hey , you 're hungry , right ? How could you tell ? Fung 's ? - See you there . - Yeah . ( SIGHS ) ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) You 're up early . Dude , you need to talk to Alison . Why , What 's going on ? ( SIGHS ) I need to pay my tuition . I 'm changing schools for you guys . If the money 's not in the account today ... I 'm sorry , but your sick German 's gonna have to wait till next semester . Alison will pay , all right ? Don 't worry about that . She wants an expense report . ( SCOFFS ) I 'll talk to her , okay ? Yeah , well , can you hurry ? 'Cause I 'm technically homeless and I just split up with my girlfriend . - Everything else okay ? - Not really . You ever heard the one about the lesbian and the U-Haul ? Uh ... Never mind . Forget it . I want answers , Beth . I know there 's a shitload you 're not telling us . I 'll know more soon , all right ? All you need to do is travel safe , okay , Cosima ? - I 'll see you soon . - Yeah , yeah , yeah , whatever . Okay , see ya . Okay . ART : We used to talk through our personal shit all the time . I got cop problems and a shit relationship . Maybe you remember your divorce . Yeah . I remember that you were there for me when I needed you . I don 't need you yet . You just had a rough couple of months . ( SCOFFS ) God , what is it that 's got you so twisted up ? Hmm ? Is it just Paul ? ( SIGHS ) It 's my shit . Don 't take it on . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Hey . ( CHUCKLES ) So what 's up with the mutilated face and modified dick ? ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm sure you 're gonna hazard a guess , Ang . That shit is darkly sexual . ( CHUCKLES ) You guys always catch the weird ones . It 's mathematically unfair . So how you doin ' , Beth ? I 'm great , Angie , thanks . - Should we go ? - Yeah . ( ART SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) She 's shaky , dude . She 's fine . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) - I 'll catch up with ya . - Yeah . Look , Constable , I only popped round for a drink . The bar at the Highcroft is very classy . All the bartenders in their little matador jackets . You were arrested there for solicitation six months ago , as well . But I was released without charge . Only this time we caught your Bay Street Blow Boy , too . Well , now I 'm confused . Is that a sexual or narcotic reference ? Possession , solicitation , public urination , that 's nice . That was a performance piece , and I never should 've been charged . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Raj ! You 're gonna kill somebody here . Thanks , Beth . Straight up , I need a favor . With this Paul shit I 've been telling you about ... RAJ : Yeah . Are you gonna break up with him ? I think he 's cheating on me . Oh . Think I could borrow a little surveillance gear on the DL ? Uh , yeah . Thanks , man . So what 's the deal ? Someone dropped this in your lap ? Yeah , anonymous tip to my work cell . I 'm waiting on a trace . Yeah , between the tattoos and the body mods , I 'll have an ID soon . I 'm gonna shake up some sources , see if it 's somebody I know . That cool ? HARDCASTLE : She making her meetings ? Yes . Masks . - ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) - ( SIGHS ) MK ? Anybody home ? MIKA : In the back . Mika ? MIKA : Right here . BETH : This again ? I thought we were meeting in person this time . - Put the mask on . - I 'm not wearing the stupid mask . Why aren 't you here ? You drove your car . I told you always come on foot . You 're not scared enough . You convinced me my boyfriend 's a spy . ( STUTTERS ) Is that not enough for you ? MIKA : Ooh . You have three minutes . Could you at least take off the mask ? You said face-to-face . ( SIGHS ) There . It 's a nice face . So , tell me about this body . What did you see ? I saw Neolution . So this is the guy , the guy you met online ? MIKA : I 'm not stupid . I never met him . I just watched . His name was Basspair86 . - So he 's Neolution ? - No . Well , yes , but no . He 's just a tadpole . Neos put their ideas in these stupid tadpoles ' heads so they can experiment on them . Did you tell the others about me ? I never reveal a source . That 's why you brought me into this in the first place , isn 't it ? But you told them what they are ? Yeah , they deserve to know . It puts them in danger . You gotta get it . The only reason I 'm alive is because they think I 'm dead . Neos are everywhere . I tracked one into your bed . I tracked one into the police , it might even be your partner . Art 's not a spy . You know what , screw this . No , Beth , please , please don 't leave . I don 't have many friends . Well , then we need each other . I 'll do the legwork but go back to these " Cheek Choppers : Black female , white male . Where did they kill Basspair86 ? - An ambulance . - An ambulance ? It 's getting harder for them to hide . Their secrets squeeze out through these stupid tadpoles so start at the bottom . - Club Neolution . - ( WATCH BEEPS ) Time 's up . Mika , you ... You can meet us in person . You don 't have to do this alone . ( SIGHING ) Tracked down the tattoos . Our Vic 's name is Edward Capra . Capra , okay . Yeah , I got an address , I got parents to visit . - What do you got ? - An online handle . Mr. Capra might go by Basspair86 . Tell me something , how the hell do you know that ? Uh , I 'm busy out here , all right ? Tell Raj to check the body mod forums . Tell him I said he 's good at that . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ASTRID : Can I help you ? Yeah , I 'm looking to have my breasts surgically modified into like corkscrews . Mmm ... ( SMACKS LIPS ) Yeah , and , unfortunately , we 're members only . BETH : Mmm-hmm . ( SMACKS LIPS ) Detective Childs . ( MUSIC CONTINUES FAINTLY ) MAN : ( SIGHING ) Oh , yeah . Yes ! And they 're riding nicely on your hips , too . Mmm-hmm . ( SNIFFS ) ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) ( CHUCKLES ) I knew you 'd love this piece . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) - Olivier Duval . - ASTRID : Yeah , it ? Astrid . There 's a cop upstairs . I 'm busy . What 's his name ? Her name is Childs . ( SIGHS ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( MACHINE WHIRRING ) ( SIGHS DEEPLY ) Did you guess that I was a cop , too ? Yeah . Implants , magnets . So she implants magnets in fingers ? She implants lots of things in lots of places . Totally out of the blue , does she ever bifurcate dicks ? That 's an alteration , not an implant . Ah , right . I see the distinction . So , are magnets like a Neolution thing ? Attract-repel ? Neolution is just an ethos . Like about creating yourself . Individual evolutionary choice . BETH : It 's also kinda cool . Yeah . - Totally cool . - ( BETH CHUCKLES ) Do you know a guy named Edward Capra , by any chance ? No . No ? This guy here ? - What happened ? - Well , I 'm homicide , so somebody hastened his demise . Anybody cares about this guy , they should get in contact with me . Congratulations . - ALISON : ( OVER CELL PHONE ) Hello ? - I 'm here , Alison . Where are you ? I sent a courier . How do I put bullets in this thing ? You don 't . You wait until I teach you how to use it , okay ? I just wanna blast something right now . Yeah , I know that feeling . - How 's Paul ? - We 're great . No , you 're not . I can hear it in your voice . - Ugh , well , we 're fine . - ( KNOCKING ON WINDOW ) Shit . Is this a flower guy ? Yes , I arranged them myself . His name is Ramone . - Ramone ? - RAMONE : Yeah . Delivery from Mrs. Hendrix . Oh , you , uh , must be her sister . - Yeah , we 're related , yeah . - Oh . ( GROANS ) Here you go . Ah , there 's a card in there . Okay . Good-looking family . Hmm , horny little bastard . These are nice , though . - Frosted greens , muted orange . - ( COCKS GUN ) I can 't stand those garish tropicals everyone 's using . I couldn 't spare too many helpers but ... It 's okay . This little bottle 's the other thing ? - Mmm-hmm . - I really hope it 's not yours . God , no . It 's my daughter 's . Please don 't mix it up with anything . I won 't , I won 't . Okay , you repeat after me . ( EXHALES ) I promise that I will not gun up until Beth has shown me basic firearm safety . - I promise . - ( GUN CLICKS ) And I promise to put Cosima 's tuition and airfare into her account this afternoon . Yes , fine , fine , but you have to administer the funds from now on . I can 't keep running off to the bank at a moment 's notice . - Thanks , Alison . - Toodles . - Toodles . - ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) - ( KEYS JANGLING ) - ( CAR ENGINE STARTS ) Olivier . Olivier , just tell Paul to take her on a holiday . OLIVIER : ( OVER CELL PHONE ) The relationship is disintegrating . Paul has neither influence or insight left . Beth needs a new monitor . - There 's no other candidate in place . - Aldous ... She just walked into my club and I can 't tell if it was a coincidence or not . Well , how could you ? It 's police business . I have other levers . - You do ? - of course . Leave it with me . - ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) - Is there a problem ? ( SIGHS ) I would say so . One of my subjects seems to have exhumed one of yours . ( SIGHS ) I beg your pardon ? BETH : Dr. Leekie . Wow , this is an honor . A detective studying biotechnology . - Yeah , truthfully , I 'm just cramming . - Mmm . You 're wanted , Aldous . So I understand that your followers wear a single white contact lens , is that right ? - I wouldn 't call them " followers : - Right . Well , I have a victim of foul play who was wearing one white contact lens so ... Do you know an Edward Capra ? - No , I 'm sorry . - No ? So this guy had some pretty serious body mod going on . Not exactly this crowd , but your " Freaky Leekies " really ran with the ball , didn 't they ? DR. ALDOUS : Neolution is an open-source concept . We embrace the fringes , the fiction to our science . Well , your book inspires them to play God , to tinker on themselves in basement labs . ( LAUGHS ) Every scientific discovery in history , including God , began with " tinkering in the basement . " God was a scientific discovery ? A little joke . We 're all impatient for the future . Excuse me . One more thing . Mr. Capra had his cheek cut out , post-mortem . Can you think of any reason for that ? No , that 's horrifying . ( SIGHS ) It certainly is . I 'm Evie Cho . Hello . And , uh , how are you connected ? I 'm not . Alas , we can 't help you , Detective . I 'm so sorry . You must absorb a tremendous amount of pain in your work . - Comes with the territory . - Yes . The paths we choose . That was a LEDA clone , wasn 't it ? You know , I 've never seen one in person . I 'll steer her away . You look after your end , Evie . WOMAN : Please welcome to the stage , Dr. Aldous Leekie . ( CROWD APPLAUDING ) Hey , I got a text . Where 's Art ? MAN : Boardroom . Hey , what 's up ? I got called in . I got the trace from your tip . You did ? ( STAMMERS ) That 's crazy . I 've been calling all day . The number was activated and used only once . - A burner . - Okay , so ... Could be random , could be someone you know . Either way , you 're off the case . What ? You serious ? - Beth ... - No , no , no , no . That 's bullshit . That 's my case . They called me , Lieutenant . That 's an order . - ( DOOR OPENS ) - Might ... Can I see you for a second ? - Yeah . - It 's a thing upstairs . - Right UP - - ( SIGHS ) - See your union rep . - Why ? ( GROANS ) A piss test . I should 've known . This is the stuff you wanted , right ? Jeez , you really came through for me , man . ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SNORTING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) PAUL : Hey . BETH : Hey , yourself . You look nice . Did you have a good day ? No . ( SIGHS ) Shit . You know , if things are so bad at work , I was thinking I have some weeks banked , you take a leave , and we 'll take a holiday . - A holiday ? - Sure . How about Barbados ? How bout we just lock the door and drink and screw for , like , two months ? No , we 're not gonna solve our problems like that . We 're not gonna solve our problems at all . I can 't breed . Yeah , I made it clear I can live without kids . So did I. I made it clear all I really need is a lover who can look me in the eyes . Can you look at me ? Look at me . Can you see me ? Can you knit me together , or just tear me apart ? Stop it . What are you on ? - Hmm ? - Hmm ? ( WHISPERING ) Touch me . Touch me . Come on . You 're supposed to reach inside me . Come on . Kiss me . - Kiss me , kiss me , kiss me . - ( INHALES SHARPLY ) Kiss me . Just ... - just ... - Kiss me for real , please ! Stop . ( SHUDDERS ) Why are you doing this ? Do you realize how paranoid that sounds ? Yes . ( GASPS ) You 're hollow , Paul . There 's nothing inside . I filled you in with hunches and all I know for sure is you won 't protect me . You 're right . Just tell me what you want . Do you want this to end ? This is all for you . You say it 's over and it 's over . You end it , you coward ! ( noon SLAMS ) ( NEIGHING ) ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) ( SIGHS ) Beth ? I come in peace . Everything all right ? - Hey , Maya . - Hi , Beth . Can I just watch TV with you guys ? That 's it . Just that . That 's all I need . All right , Maya , it 's time for bed . - MAYA : Dad ... - Come on now . Come give Beth a hug . ( BETH CHUCKLES ) - Good night . - Good night . Don 't let the bed buddies bite .

One second . I 'm sorry , it 's so loud in here . Can you hear me ? Hey , Trina . Hey , uh , we spoke today at Club Neolution . Oh , of course ! Yeah , of course I remember . - What 's up ? - I 'm , uh ... I 'm worried about my boyfriend ... Aaron . He left to go meet these hardcore Neos . Okay , who are they ? I , uh , I dunno . They came here to the club . A black girl and a white guy . I 'm gonna call you from the car , okay ? They 're going to Aaron 's lab . Chinatown is where all the biohackers are . Okay , I 'm close . Why would he let them implant something in his cheek ? They said it was a biometric study . A dentist inserted this tiny little grain , but now ... It 's growing . Okay , well , I 'm gonna make sure he 's all right , ' Kay ? So , I 'm in the tunnel , now where do I go ? Okay , around the corner , you 'll see the building . You have to go up the fire escape to the third floor . 'Kay . I 'm gonna call you back , all right ? ( LOUD CLATTERING ) AARON : I can 't do that any more . I 'm sorry .

ROXIE : Okay then , hop up . FRANK : At least he didn 't try to take it out himself like Mr. Capra . ROXIE : That 's tampering , and it 's well covered in the contract . Go on . Go under . - When you wake up , it 'll all be gone . - ( AARON GASPING ) - FRANK : He had to go . - God damn it . DUKO : Did you even try to talk him out of it ? FRANK : He wouldn 't listen to reason . They 're not gonna be happy about any of this . - Can you see ? Do you need more light ? - It 's good . It 's right there . DUKO : Careful .

 Previously on " marvel 's agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Why do you want to rebuild the portal , Jemma ? Jemma : Because I have to get back there . I 've run dozens of simulations , the monolith was just one option , though . We 're not gonna give up , okay ? Coulson : What is it ? Some kind of suspension gel ? It keeps them in stasis - - alive , healthy , just asleep . Strucker . Where do i find ward ? I tried to do what ward wanted . I tried to kill him . Professor garner . Aah ! [ Growls ] [ Hawaiian music plays ] [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Chuckles ] Did you just spoil a perfect moment by capturing it ? You looked too good , sun hitting you like that . Ha ! Well , this time tomorrow , we 'll be home . Look who 's spoiling the moment now . What would you say if I didn 't go back to S.H.I.E.L.D. ? [ Chuckles ] You 're serious . At least , not right away . So , is this the island talking , or are you - - I mean ... There are a lot of reasons why this won 't work - - why we won 't work . I forgot how direct you are . I don 't want to be one of those reasons . You won 't be . Listen , we 're older now and wiser . And I don 't plan on losing you a second time . So what do you say ? You want to go steady ? [ Both laugh ] Weren 't we just talking about how we 're older ? Yes . All right , then . To new beginnings . To new beginnings . [ Glasses clink ] [ Chuckles ] I don 't know when Melinda 's coming back , Phil . We only got home a couple of days ago . Wanted to thank you for sending over jiaying 's things from afterlife . Coulson : Hopefully , it 'll help shed some light on our new inhuman situation . I 'll keep you posted if I find anything interesting . And , Phil , I wouldn 't wait for Melinda to call you . Good advice . Thanks . All right . [ Phone beeps ] [ Coughs ] Oh , god . Oh , my god . [ Gasps ] [ Gasps ] Daisy : We 're not monsters . You can 't just lock us up in some ice prison because you don 't know what else to do . No one 's talking prison . And , technically , it 's a gel matrix . They 're putting people in stasis . Think of it as a medically induced coma , a way to hit the pause button until we find a better solution . " A better solution . " What does that mean ? The atcu 's looking for a cure . I 'm not suggesting that 's for everyone , because it 's not , but some people might want to - - we are not a disease . I didn 't say that you were . You can 't just expect people to go through that kind of change and immediately have a handle on it . Do you remember how scared I was at first ? Yes . I also remember you iced yourself so that you wouldn 't hurt any of us . You 've got to admit , things are getting out of hand . I know . People are changing in uncontrolled environments - - I know , but everyone deserves a chance to be who they are . That 's where you 're wrong . You 're being seduced by your own experience . Just because you learned how to control your powers doesn 't mean everyone else will . I mean , what if a person 's hurting themselves or those around them ? What - - what if they can 't stop ? Take lash . If putting a bullet in that monster 's head doesn 't do the trick , then what ? That 's not fair . That 's one guy . Most inhumans fall somewhere between me and him . And that 's the message I 'm hoping the president and his advisors will hear when I meet with them today . The president of the United States ? It 's off the books , but the global community 's coming together to discuss the future of enhanced people . We 're meeting at NORAD in Colorado . But S.H.I.E.L.D. isn 't supposed to exist . That 's why I 'm going in as a consultant for the atcu . So rosalind price - - arranged it , yes . We 're taking Zephyr one , picking her up on the way . Are you sure this is a good idea ? We can 't afford to miss it . That 's why I want you to talk to rosalind before the meeting . Win her over to your side of things . Could be a real start toward legitimizing S.H.I.E.L.D. But it might help if you can present a successful inhuman case , one that 's not an extreme on either side . Joey Gutierrez is due for reassessment . I 'd be more than happy to check in on him , see how he 's progressing . Couldn 't hurt . I agree . I can send you my report while you 're in the air . Thank you for your help on this . It 's what I 'm here for . No . I just don 't know why you 're calling me . All right . Give me your location . I 'll meet you there . Dr. garner . Hey . Looks like you 're heading to the lab . That 's a good sign , right ? I 'm trying . We 're trying . Sometimes it just feels like it would 've been best if I hadn 't told Fitz everything . You did the right thing in telling the truth , Jemma . Secrets can eat you up from the inside . [ Footsteps ] ¶ ¶ you busy ? Uh , no . No . Sorry i haven 't been in here more . There 's - - there 's no need to explain . What 's that ? It 's my phone . I had it with me . Uh , I took pictures , made some recordings to document my time there . It 's quite damaged , but I kept it on me as a remembrance . I was hoping you could - - recover the data . It 's probably pointless . Yeah , no . Maybe not . Just thought if you saw it for - - myself , yeah . I always felt better having you as my second pair of eyes . Well , couldn 't hurt to try . I 'll get right on it . Thank you , Fitz . ¶ ¶ but I didn 't know he 'd change into that thing . What is he ? Bobbi : You worried about Andrew ? Or pissed that the strucker kid went comatose before he could talk ? Well ... Everyone at h.Q. Says that Andrew 's fine . And as far as hydra ... We 'll get them . I hope you stick around . Hydra 's not the only thing we 're facing these days . Between the inhumans , this monster we 're hunting , and the atcu on our ass , we need all the help that we can get . Monster ? Yeah . Big ugly thing , likes to kill other inhumans . You 've been tracking him ? Trying . Transforms into a man , which makes him impossible to find . ¶ ¶ may . Hi . Oh , my god . It 's good to see you . I-i got to go . Go where ? I , uh , need to talk to Andrew . He 's doing a psych eval on one of the new inhuman recruits . I checked the containment room . He 's not - - no , he 's at a training facility off-site . Where ? [ Breathes deeply ] I can actually create things now . And how does that make you feel ? Excited , you know ? I have so much more control now . [ Roars ] [ Groans ] Dr. garner ? Control . Yes . That 's important . Daisy thinks I could be a real asset to S.H.I.E.L.D. But she said my fate is in your hands . Yes , Joey . It is . ¶ ¶ don 't put your shirt on for my benefit . Heard about your hydra pool party . And here I was worried about you . Never liked kebo much myself . Funny name . Locked me in a trunk . You all right ? Of course . Good . 'Cause taking out some of ward 's key players brings us one step closer to finding the bastard . No . Coulson 's busy with Daisy , so now is as good a time as any . Hunter , it 's just ... It 's not a good idea . Is this about Andrew ? 'Cause I thought we were past all that - - now that he 's all right , i mean . Okay . Did things get slightly out of control ? Yes . But nothing i couldn 't handle , obviously . And everything I did was to protect you . Bob , will you stop for one second ? I don 't want either of us to go after ward . You - - you 're joking , right ? Since when ? Whatever it is , lay it on me . I think you 've been reckless and stupid . Can I take back what I just said ? And for what ? So ward won 't lay a bloody finger on you again ! That 's what . Yeah , I 'm stupid , because I love you ! I don 't need a knight in shining armor , hunter . I need you alive . [ Sighs ] I don 't want to lose you . Okay . You 're right . Or lose ourselves . Become so obsessed with revenge that we - - we turn into monsters just like him . [ Breathes deeply ] ¶ ¶ never walked onto a flying base before . Guess I can cross that off my bucket list . So , where does the tour begin ? That 's actually up to Daisy . She 's gonna show you around . ¶ ¶ [ machinery whirring ] ¶ ¶ all : Happy birthday , Jemma ! Happy birthday , Jemma . It 's not the same without you here . Say hi to your parents for me , and I 'll see you soon . [ Mouse clicking ] Wow . Two moons . Bloody hell . ¶ ¶ [ groans ] Jemma : Fitz ... It 's possible I 'm on one of the poles , but it 's strange . The stars and the two moons , they keep disappearing and reappearing . But there 's no sun . There 's never a sun . Last time you saw me , i was a wreck . Now I feel ... Empowered . [ Chuckles ] That probably sounds stupid . Sounds like you 've grown to accept that this is a part of you . Honestly , as a construction guy , the idea that I could build in a day something that would normally take months - - it 's unreal . Or tear something down . Yeah . If I have to . Just like that . Daisy 's trying to put together a team of soldiers , right ? Mm . To fight . To fight evil . I could be a real weapon against it . A dangerous weapon . That 's what I 'm worried about . [ Door slams ] Man : We weren 't expecting anyone to - - Melinda , what 's going on ? Take Mr. Gutierrez back to base . Melinda , we 're in the middle of a session . Dr. garner - - not anymore . Do it now . Ma 'am , we have protocols . Take care of them , then go . Come on . [ Door closes ] What 's all this about ? We need to talk ... Once we 're alone . Thanks for coming . You can settle down . No one knows we 're here . You getting any sleep ? [ Scoffs ] It 's kind of hard when I 'm being hunted nonstop . I 'm really only worried about the one who wants to blast a hole through my chest . If you 've got intel on the guy , why not call Daisy ? 'Cause I can 't put her life at risk , too . I went looking for my friends . And those who aren 't missing are dead . [ Bird calling ] You 're telling me this why ? Because you fought by my side against that thing . It eliminates you as a suspect . Why would I be a suspect ? 'Cause you 're with S.H.I.E.L.D. Okay . I - - I 'm not sure I 'm following . Lash is in S.H.I.E.L.D. And with your help , i can prove it . Rosalind : I appreciate you showing me around like this . We built this module to help those in transition . It 's made out of adaptive material , so it can contain all sorts of powers . It 's also bulletproof , which comes in handy when people like you shoot at people like me . And you really think this is more humane ? Our goal is to observe people , educate them , and , yes , it can take time , but - - we don 't always have that luxury . But throwing people away like they don 't even exist is the answer ? That 's not what we 're doing . Sure as hell looks like it . Well , it 's not that simple . Just admit it . You 're afraid of people like me , afraid of our power . Absolutely . Do you even know your own strength ? Could you take down this plane , for instance ? I wouldn 't do that . But if you wanted to ? You could kill me right now . Mankind 's scary enough as it is . Some psycho gets a gun , and watch out . But now people are their own weapon . Not everyone is like - - " some " is enough . That 's all it takes . You only see the terrible things . That 's not true . I protect people . It doesn 't matter . How can you say that ? Because for every Daisy Johnson , there 's a lash , and it 's ignorant for you to think otherwise . [ Breathes deeply ] Melinda , talk to me . What 's all this about ? I need to know - - for myself - - before anyone else gets involved . Know what ? I saw your flight logs . I tracked your movements . You were within 30 miles of at least five inhuman deaths . Why are you looking at my flight logs ? Pulled your medical files , too . Your blood work was deleted . So , maybe Simmons accidentally - - you thought you covered your tracks , but you didn 't . Melinda , honestly , what are you getting at ? That Von strucker kid was alive . He didn 't die in that blast . I tracked him down . He told me what you did . What I did . So some kid says I - - he wasn 't lying . The look on his face ... It was pure terror . What happened to you ? You can tell me . Melinda - - don 't lie to me . You don 't want to know . He said you were a monster . Melinda , don 't - - how could this even happen ? Melinda , stop ! Andrew , please ! Please ! Stop ! ¶ ¶ Jemma : It 's been three weeks , Fitz . If I don 't find something , if I don 't eat , I won 't make it . [ Mouse clicks ] Fitz , hi . I don 't know why I 'm still talking with you ... Why I 'm recording myself . You 're never gonna see this , are you ? I still haven 't found water , and it 's , um - - well , I ... It 's , uh ... I 'm having trouble focusing , and I 'm trying to stay positive . But I 'm scared . I 'm scared , Fitz . [ Breathes deeply ] Do you remember when we first met ? I do . You were so quiet and pasty , and ... So incredibly smart , handsome ... [ Coughs ] Quite a strange feeling - - isn 't it ? - - never wanting to be without someone . You must have been so annoyed , me following you around all the time . No . Never . [ Sniffles ] I imagine our dinner sometimes - - where we 'd go , what we 'd eat . I wonder about us a lot , actually . There 's this small cottage in perthshire we drove by once when I was a girl , some - - some ... Family holiday , and I don 't know why , but I - - I found it so lovely . I still think about it - - a place where you and I could have ... [ Sighs ] But that 's that , I suppose . I 'm not sure how long this battery will last . I should save it , just in case , for more important things . [ Breathing heavily ] But I 'll still talk to you on my own , if that 's all right . I 'll always be with you , Fitz . [ Breathes deeply ] ¶ ¶ [ groans ] Oh , thank god you 're awake . I am so sorry . I-i didn 't want to hurt you . I - - I panicked . [ Breathing quickly ] Where are we ? We couldn 't stay there , not with S.H.I.E.L.D. I needed time to explain . You don 't know how many times i almost told you . I just - - I didn 't know how . I didn 't ask for this . Oh , god . What have you done ? [ Grunting ] Melinda , don 't . Unh ! Let me go ! Don 't do that ! I don 't - - i don 't know what I 'll do . Instinct will take over again ... Like it did at the convenience store . Instinct ? I didn 't want to hurt anyone , but I - - I didn 't know what was happening . You killed all those people . How ? When did this - - when did - - after Hawaii . Daisy 's mom kept records . I was going through them for any insight , for research . And I found a book . It had all these names of inhumans . Now , jiaying must have rigged it with a terrigen crystal to keep out anyone who couldn 't survive the mist . Lucky me . [ Cracking ] At first , I was relieved . I survived . But I knew something had happened . I felt sick and nauseous . There was this intense pulsing , like my heart was in my head . [ Breathes shakily ] Felt different , like ... Like a part of me was unlocked . Unlocked ? I don 't know how else to - - i just - - I had to - - it was as if I was compelled . I had to be near them . The inhumans . I didn 't know why . It was - - it was intense . I had this new desire . I had a - - a - - had a hunger ... On my skin . It wasn 't until I finally met one that my body took over , and I - - I lashed out . And then I felt relief . But with you ... Andrew ? [ Knock on door ] You in there ? You wouldn 't understand . I had to keep you away . That 's why you - - yeah , I was a coward . I wanted to tell you , but I was worried that - - you had - - you had to know . I didn 't end things with you because I don 't love you . I did it to protect you . I 'm still in love with you , Melinda . And I need your help . ¶ ¶ coulson : And where did they go after may dismissed the security detail ? Update me as you know more . [ Cellphone beeps ] Everything all right ? Not sure yet . Could be as simple as a workplace romance gone wrong . That doesn 't sound simple . I think you were in the middle of telling me what great friends you and Daisy are now . I may have overstepped . But one thing 's for certain - - that girl 's got fire . And you still haven 't told anyone about her ? I keep my promises , Phil . They have no idea . New look ? Old look , actually . It 's been a while , though . Uh , may I ? Oh . Sure . So ... You gonna tell me what really happened ? 'Cause I 'm not quite buying the shark-attack bit . You 're not buying that ? One of my men cut it off . Saved my life . By chopping off your hand ? You kind of had to be there . Does it hurt ? Every day . Phantom pain . Thing that 's missing is the thing that you feel the most . Makes it hard to forget . So maybe you don 't . But it 's also important to look ahead , see what 's in front of you . [ Door opens ] We close to NORAD ? No . Another quinjet 's requested to dock . Lincoln , what are you doing here ? Coulson : Where 'd you find him ? He came to me . He 's got intel on lash . She atcu ? We 're working together now . Yeah , we all want to catch that thing . Well , Mr. Campbell , you 've come this far . What do you have to say ? Those of us from afterlife , we were trained to blend in . Afterlife ? I 'll explain later . And yet that thing keeps finding us , killed most of my friends . Lincoln gave me names . I checked them against the bodies we could identify . That 's how I knew lash was using jiaying 's ledger to find us . Her ledger ? She kept a genealogy of inhumans . She was the only one allowed to use it , until ... Until S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered it . And there 's only one person i know who had access . Dr. garner ? But there 's no way . It 's not possible . I didn 't want to believe it , either . So you 're not just saying Andrew has the ledger . You 're saying ... I saw may access his flight logs this morning . I talked with her . She was upset , but I thought that she ... She and Andrew are missing . I just got word . Oh , god . Reroute the plane - - New York . Pull all the satellite footage from the cocoon . We need to find them . I can 't believe I 'm saying this , but the president 's gonna have to wait . Whatever you need , I 'll let them know . Andrew wouldn 't hurt her . He 's killed dozens of us . Yeah , well , what if he doesn 't know what he 's doing once he turns - - he - - he blacks out or something ? Inhumans can 't change form . That 's not how it works . I saw it myself . No , what I 'm saying is , it 's temporary . He won 't always be able to shift between monster and man . He 's still in transition . Becoming inhuman . And when that transition 's complete ? He 'll stay lash , permanently . The man you think you know is disappearing , if he 's not already gone . May : Andrew ... If I hadn 't shown up ... Were you going to hurt Joey ? Of course not . And you know I 'd never lay a finger on Daisy . But you went after Lincoln . That kid has a dark side . You understand more than anyone . Look at what happened in Bahrain . What ? You saw firsthand what inhumans were capable of . If you hadn 't killed that little girl , everyone around you would 've suffered . They all would 've died . But you saved them . This isn 't you . You would never say that . No , Melinda , i know exactly what I 'm saying . You and me - - we 're the same . That 's why I need your help . I never wanted to hurt that girl . I know . I know , and believe me , I don 't want to do what I 'm doing , either . I have to . I know you think I 've lost myself . I haven 't . I don 't know what to do . I know . [ Chuckles ] Do you remember our first apartment ? The one on cranbrook . One room , a stupid futon for a bed , and that winter when it got so cold , we - - we used the oven as our heater . And not the safest way to keep warm , but ... It did the trick . Melinda ... [ Inhales sharply ] The world has gotten more complicated , hasn 't it ? I know we can 't pretend it all away . But I 'm still the same man you fell in love with . I never gave up on you . Please don 't give up on me . ¶ ¶ coulson : Sorry to interrupt . Still waiting on Joey 's reassessment . Phil ... You don 't understand . I 'm starting to . You all right ? We 're old friends . That 's why I 'd prefer to see everyone walk out of here unharmed . But in case you got something else in mind , I 'm not alone . Containment module 's secure . Copy that . Hall team 's getting into position . Remember , this is coulson 's op . We do not move unless he gives the order . Go . He 's not gonna come quietly . Coulson : This doesn 't have to go down badly . I 'll make sure you 're taken care of . I understand the position you 're in - - I do . And I don 't envy it . But I am trying to help you . We 've got an outbreak on our hands . What the hell does he mean by that ? Daisy : Calm down . Coulson knows what he 's doing . You sure about that ? I 'm simply trying to sort the good from the bad . You gave me this job . That 's a pretty poor interpretation of a therapist . Look around you . We 're in some abandoned building , may 's tied up - - you 're not okay . I know how it looks , but I have a moral responsibility . You 'll see , soon . [ Chuckling ] I 'm doing you a favor . He 's insane . That 's not true . He 's just sick . The beast 's gonna come out , and you can 't control it . Don 't make things worse ' cause you got an axe to grind . He 's not just gonna let us take him . He 's gonna defend himself . Do not engage . We move on coulson 's order . I 've only killed those who deserve it . [ Electricity crackles ] Who the hell made you judge , jury , and executioner ? What are you doing ? You 've got to get him out of here , now ! Lincoln - - you tore my friends apart . You have no right ! That 's enough . Calm down , Andrew , please . I have every right . Andrew , listen to me . We can help you . [ Electricity crackles ] The atcu is close to a cure . [ Grunting ] ¶ ¶ I am the cure . No ! [ Shouting ] [ Grunting ] Lincoln and lash are in the east wing of the building . We have to get him to the module . Mack : On it , sir . Phil ... Our goal is to capture , not kill . We just got to get Lincoln on the same page . Try those . [ Electricity crackles ] [ Shouts ] Aah ! [ Both shouting ] ¶ ¶ oh ! Really got to commit to that shotgun-axe idea . Could use a little help here ! What 's your twenty ? [ Grunting ] [ Grunts ] Andrew ... We 're friends . [ Grunting ] [ Electricity crackles ] Or maybe - - maybe just acquaintances . We got him . ¶ ¶ aah ! Aah ! Aah ! [ Choking ] [ Growling ] Aah ! No ! [ Screaming ] [ Rumbling ] ¶ ¶ thank you . Are you okay ? Yeah . I didn 't know you could do that . That makes two of us . Where is he ? No idea . But we got to get him to the containment module - - now . ¶ ¶ I 'll get him to where he needs to go . [ Grumbles ] ¶ ¶ unh ! [ Growls lightly ] Andrew , stop ! Move . Go on . Might as well . I 've thought about my death enough times ... The different ways that I could go . I just never thought it 'd be you . I never knew why you married me . I was never as ... Kind and empathetic as you . That 's why it was so easy for me to walk away ... [ Groans ] ... why I gave up on you . I lost something when I left you . I won 't do it again . But you have to stop this . Melinda ... ¶ ¶ [ air rushing ] How 'd you know that wouldn 't kill him ? I didn 't . [ Keys clacking ] I bloody knew it . Fitz , you all right ? Yeah , I think I 've , uh ... Remember this ? Yeah , from the castle chamber . Okay . Oh , is that the other man ? Well , I 'm just gonna say what we 're all thinking - - he has a hog face . He does have a hog face . Okay . So , look at the logo of the space program he 's with . [ Keys clacking ] And if you turn it upside down , they look similar , yeah ? Bit of a stretch , mate . Possible . Okay . Well , um ... What if the group who carved this symbol into the chamber door is the same group that sent will through the portal ? I thought NASA sent will through . Could go beyond NASA - - way beyond . Please don 't tell me you think some ancient order 's behind all this , 'cause that 's a bit mental even for you . I know how it sounds , but we 're dealing with a portal that leads to another planet , so ... Anything 's possible . It 's worth checking out , Fitz . You gonna take coulson up on his offer , stick around for a while ? Can 't run forever . If we put Andrew in stasis as a human , it 'll slow his transformation , giving us more time to find a cure . Now , I can 't pretend to understand what you 're going through , but for what it 's worth ... If I had the chance to save someone I love , I 'd take it . What would you do ? Well ... It 's a temporary solution . I think we can all acknowledge that . But Andrew helped me . So I 'd - - I 'd do whatever it takes . Do it . ¶ ¶ do you need to go after her ? [ Breathes deeply ] She wouldn 't want me to , not right now . It 's been a long day . Mm-hmm . Buy you a drink ? Please . Hey . You okay ? I couldn 't sleep . There aren 't a lot of windows in the base , and I wanted to - - watch the sunrise . I , uh ... I can 't make any promises , but I think I may have found something . Might help us open up the portal . Really ? And , um ... Fixed your sim card , so ... I heard your recordings and saw your video . Didn 't know you thought about settling down in perthshire . [ Chuckles ] That 's in Scotland . I know where it is , Fitz . [ Breathes deeply ] So when you said all those things about ... I mean , you were tired and dehydrated . I was as clearheaded then as I 've ever been ... When I said all those things . What do you think we should do about it ? For now ... Let 's just watch the sunrise . ¶ ¶ [ glasses clink ] [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] What 's wrong ? Nothing . I never thought i deserved this . What , a trip to Hawaii ? No . Happiness . This kind of happiness . Of course you do . We both do . Mm . ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ so , why am I here ? We 'll get to that . It 's a shame about Werner Von strucker . I hope , for your sake , he doesn 't wake up . I 'm not worried . He 's weak , like his father . Ah , careful , Mr. ward . You paid a price for that boy . You should ask yourself if it was worth it . You gave me his location . I gave you what you asked for . I 'm just not sure that you 're asking for the right things . Revenge only provides a temporary pleasure . Ah . But a pleasure , nonetheless . Ah . [ Chuckles ] You should think on a grander scale . Oh , it 'll be grand . How about I cut off the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Because without Phil coulson ... S.H.I.E.L.D. won 't grow back . [ Cellphone ringing ] Ohh . [ Cellphone beeps ] Excuse me a moment . Ms. price . I wanted to apologize for missing our meeting at NORAD . I will bring him to you soon enough . Time is of the essence . [ Door opens ] Oh , I better go . I 'll be in touch . [ Cellphone beeps ] You don 't have to leave so soon . How about some breakfast first ? Are you cooking ? I don 't cook . But I 'm an expert at going out to eat . Is there anything good around here ? Ruthie 's diner is about two blocks away . She makes a mean scramble . I think I can make time for that . Good . [ Chuckles ] ¶ ¶

 Previously on " Hunters " ... That 's my wife . I 'm afraid we can 't determine that yet either , Flynn . She could have been killed months ago , even years . I 'm gonna show you the truth . Daddy , no ! Stop , stop ! - This is what we are . - You gave yourself a treatment . The treatment makes you vulnerable . He killed my wife . No , I am your wife . Shoot me , do it . Do it ! Slavich 's last words to me were about Hunters being inside the ETU . We 'd like to try and arrange a meeting with Brother Number Four ? That 's their leader . He 's like the Bin Laden of little green men . Is that Romanian ? Are you able to make anything out ? This one keeps repeating . Richard Seraphin . Director , Global Asset Management at the International Monetary Fund . If he 's laundering money for the Hunters ... Then he 's in contact with their leadership . Brother Number Four . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Nine , two , six , three , one , nine , one , three , six , one , five . One , three , six , one , five . Four , three , nine ... _ Brother . Welcome . The others will be overjoyed . Waited a long time for you . The others , where are they ? We 're everywhere . Okay . Not so loud . _ We 've got Briggs' initial report from the ground in Turkey . The drug money Seraphin laundered for the Hunters was funneled through the IMF to here . A military prison in Turkey ten miles from the Syrian border . That 's border as in refugees and runaway ISIS brides . The funds were allegedly being used for a well-building program . I 've seen the prison and surprise , it doesn 't have any wells . - Not much water , either . - Shocking . So who 's collecting the money ? The prison 's warden , Sharif Amari . He 's on the receiving end . Finnerman has approved extraordinary rendition . You will rendezvous with Briggs in country and extract the warden . Any local support ? None . You 'll be in a hostile area where no faction is all that fond of us . Expect a war zone . So we won 't be greeted as liberators ? I 'd love to avoid getting beheaded . This warden could be our Bin Laden 's career . We nab him , he could lead us straight to Brother Number Four 's doorstep . You 're late . We need to talk . You 're looking well . - Rough few days . - Yeah . Holed up alone drinking . How 'd that work out for you ? You were watching me . You went AWOL to find your wife . Briggs found traces of Abby 's blood in the hotel room . I shot her . To stop her from escaping ? Something like that . You should have brought her in . Happy birthday . I love you . Yes , I should have . Well , I mean , if I found out that if my wife was ... Abby 's not my wife . She never was . There 's nothing left for me to do here now , so , thanks . I 've had a blast . I 'm sorry to lose you . Especially when things are just starting to get interesting . We have a strong lead on the Hunter responsible . For what ? Everything . You gotta work on your tan lines . Way past due . You heard what happened at the hotel ? I heard Abby got away . You wanna ask about it ? At least you didn 't rip her apart . I 'm always gearing up too soon . Then I just sit around , armed to the teeth , bored out of my skull ' til go time . Flight to Turkey 's not ' til 1600 . Grab a drink ? I think I had enough last night . Besides , I 've got a human-only policy from now on . I said drink , asshole . Alison , I just want you at your best . For my good , not yours . Right ? You keep telling yourself that . You should be trying to find the mole . Ceausescu 's regime will soon fall . The CIA believe we are pro-democracy freedom fighters and foreign mercenaries helping the Romanian cause . Their contact provides us with valuable resources . But we have become soldiers in a revolution in which we have no stake . Can we trust your CIA contact ? He 's a spy , not a saint , and also human . Brother . We gained much from this conflict , but it 's time to move on . Da . Time to consider what benefits an allegiance with the Russians might bring us . Anyone else wish to speak ? We will not align ourselves with the Russians . This struggle is our own . My CIA contact . This meeting is over . Musa . Good to see you as well , my friend . Let us walk . _ Is there a problem ? He wants to see your bag . He 's not biting . Here . Try this . Hey . - Huh . - You 're welcome Briggs has visual on our warden . Apparently , Amari 's got a love nest . Lucky , huh ? Thanks . A doctor , seriously ? Don 't you have to be smart ? Where 's our guy . Upstairs , in his pied-Ã -terre . Wife and three kids at home . This is where he keeps his side piece . Shouldn 't be too hard to extract him and question him about the IMF money while his pants are down . - We got a wire in the room ? - Hm-hm . How deep is he rolling ? You tell me . Okay then . He 's got a two-man detail , one guy watching the door , the other 's gone for a smoke , should be back in five minutes , 30 seconds . That is very specific . - He 's smoking 100s . - All right . Looks like the wife 's not at home . Let 's abort , we can contact Jackson , get an audible . And give the mole another chance to slip us up ? She 's a distraction . I say we roll with it . I thought you said five-and-a-half , Briggs . He 's mine . Take the side door . We 're supposed to render him , not kill him ! He drew his weapon . Get them out of here ! Go , go ! You 're okay . You 're okay . My pack , my pack . Human . Who are you ? What do you want ? Shut up , we 're asking the questions . I don 't understand . Move your hand , move your hand . Where is Brother Number Four ? Where is Brother Number Four ? What is it ? This symbol . I 've seen it before . These cross swords . - It 's the prison emblem . - Yeah , I saw it . These shapes around it curved sort of like a crescent moon , There were four of them . Brother Number Four , where is he ? Where is he ? Brother Number Four ! Carroll . I know where he is . This can get very bad for you , Do you understand ? Very tenuous . Tell me you understand , Amari . I don 't know the four brothers . Who are you collecting the IMF money for ? Who does it go to ? Please , I must see a doctor . No , you 're gonna be fine . Unless you don 't answer our questions . Tell us where the IMF money is going , and don 't you dare say wells . - Tell us ! - Musa ! To Musa is where the money goes . Musa who ? Musa who ? Musa Wazari . I don 't know him by other name . Where do we find this Musa ? He lives in my prison . - He 's a prisoner ? - No . He stays there for safety . He claims to be freedom fighter from Romania . A man on the run . He pays me to keep him safe , safe from the outside world . But then , he becomes ... seytan . The devil . He corrupts my guards . He kills my prisoners . The strongest of men , parts of their spine go missing . There 's nothing I can do . I go to my superiors , Musa will kill me . I go to the police , they will kill my family . The Hunter who had the baby spoke Romanian . We can help you . We can get this man out of your prison , but we need to a way in . Can you do that ? No one can ever enter his room . He 's always protected , guards outside his door day and night . You will never get him alone . You leave it to us . I 'll get Jackson on the horn . This rendition just got hell of a lot more interesting . We 're not calling ETU . What ? Why not ? If there is a mole and we call it in , they 'll take Musa off . He gets away , it 's game over . If we don 't call it in , we have no support . We 're doing okay so far . But a raid on the military prison with no backup , that 's insane . Musa doesn 't know we 're coming . I 'd rather have tactical advantage than numbers . You contact Jackson , tell him we have his white whale ? Regan thinks it might tip off the mole . I 'll handle it . Were you not even gonna hear me out ? About cutting communication with our commanding officer ? No . Screw you guys . Sir , Musa Wazari , does that name mean anything to you ? Musa ? Musa Wazari . Possible pseudonym for Brother Number Four . We have intel he may be holed up at the warden 's prison . We 'll run the name . Pull up Hydra , run Musa Wazari . Any tags to go with that like , " Musa the Jackal " or something ? Just run it , Jules . You okay , sir ? We found him . Brother Number Four ? Holy shit , that 's him ? The extraction plan just changed . Run some scenarios . Belfast ' 76 ? Sure , why not ? Start there and we 'll tweak some protocols . I 'll let Langley know we 're gonna need a drone . Another shipment 's on its way . Should be here before Bucharest . This would be a great victory for your people , Musa . The tide 's turning , and not just here . Have you given any thought to what comes next for you ? After the revolution is over ? You 're a very skilled man . You would be valuable to a newly formed military . You 're an excellent leader . Calm , authoritative , well-read . I hear you 've lost a number of your men to the Russians . Now , if you were to consider working for the CIA , I know you would be gladly welcome . And we would make it worth your while . Thank you , but my fight lies with my people . And we support you . To your victory , Musa . Noroc . And for you , a symbol of our success together . Noroc . Thank you . Jackson 's scrambling a drone . Contingency if tomorrow 's raid goes sideways . And it will if the mole tells Musa that we 're coming . We need to follow protocol . We 're not throwing out the rulebook because Regan had a hunch . Regan was right about the symbol on the warden 's jacket . Oh , was she ? Well , maybe she already knew where Musa was . This whole mole thing ... She saved my life at the music store . Why would a traitor do that ? She 'll have her reasons . Hunters knew we were coming in Columbia . She took out Slavich before we had a chance to question her . Regan got us to Mrs. Slavich in the first place . Oh , yeah , with that clickety-clack bullshit . You know Jules thinks Regan knows more about the Hunter language than she 's letting on . Come on , Carroll , think about it . She 's one of them . Put yourself in her shoes . I mean , you 're alone , fighting against your own kind , against yourself . They sent me home to fight my people , I wouldn 't do it . It explains to me why Regan didn 't want to call this in . We need to tell Jackson . Oh , hell no . Regan 's his girl . He 's not gonna believe me without proof . And tomorrow , we 'll know , one way or another . Musa controls this block . He has only one exit from his cell here , but it is always guarded . If you can free the prisoners from these other blocks , this will draw his guards away from him , he will have no choice but to flee . And that 's when we grab him . Here . These will get you in . Now get rid of this monster . Keys to the kingdom . Briggs will light the fuse . The biggest threat humanity has ever known , we put the guns in Musa 's hands . How can you be sure it 's the same Musa ? Maybe you were dealing with the actual human before this Musa took over his body . It 's him . Musa was my asset . I armed his people , I trained him , I stood in his house and toasted his good fortune . Truss , it was 20 years before we found the first Hunter body . You couldn 't possibly have known that an anti-communist cell leader wasn 't human . I knew he was dangerous . A potential enemy if the tide turned . We back dozens of freedom fighters and regimes all over the world . And never learned our lesson ! We didn 't just create a monster , we helped build a terrorist organization made from them . We worked together with those people to overthrow brutal regimes . But what they chose to do after that , it 's not our responsibility . You can pass the buck all you want to , Ruth . Whatever the Hunters have done under Musa 's command , the bombings , the drug running , the murders . Our history with Musa never happened . And neither did this conversation . Are we clear ? Good . You have a drone aimed at the prison ? For a short window . The minute the Turks cry foul , our drone gets pulled . If the extraction doesn 't succeed in time , we strike . Either way , Musa does not walk out of that prison of his own accord . I sleep soundly , Truss . But if you feel the need to atone for what you did a lifetime ago , now 's your chance . Allah Hu-Akbar . Allah Hu-Akbar . Allah Hu-Akbar . Allah Hu-Akbar . Allah Hu-Akbar . Allah Hu-Akbar . And he said take thy son Isaac , who thou loves , and offer him there for a burnt offering . And in Kings , God asking for the blood sacrifice of Solomon 's own child as an act of obedience . God tests us all . Allah Hu-Akbar . Allah Hu-Akbar . Fuse is lit . We 're on . We move along block A , unlock the cells , release the prisoners , instant chaos . Musa won 't know what hit him . He wants to see you . I 'm sorry , there is a problem , Mr. Wazari . You must leave at once . The Americans , they 're coming . We can 't keep them out of your wing . You have betrayed me , Amari . Never . I 'm warning you . I 'm trying to save you . Please , you must believe me . So far , so good . Musa 's guards are fleeing his wing . Tough night ? Got a bruise , another guy got a riot . Flynn and I will push in and smoke Musa out . Briggs , you 're on your own for block D. Copy that . I 'll release more prisoners , add bodies to the herd . The UAV is about to enter Turkish airspace . How long until they reach Musa 's wing ? Any minute . Patching in the GoPro feed now . There , Musa 's wing ! Move ! You 're not ... you 're not real ! Flynn , Regan , can you hear me ? Flynn , Regan , can you hear me ? Human . But it doesn 't mean the rest of them are . Are you all right ? I 'm okay , I 'm good . I saw Musa up on the second floor . I don 't know which way he went , there 's too much smoke . He made us . We need to cut off the exit routes . Go ! - The drone is two minutes out . - Blast radius estimates ? Civilian casualties at 200 , conservatively . If Regan , Flynn , and Briggs don 't get out soon ... Move ! Move ! Where 's Regan ? She saw Musa then lost sight of him . We split up . Regan , have you located the target ? Don 't be afraid . I won 't hurt you . You know who I am . Brother Number Four . Musa . She 's not answering . You know what that means . It means she 's not answering . I haven 't seen you since you were small . You 're all grown up now . And here you are . You came to me . You understand me because you 're one of us . I am your brother . You belong to me . Move , move ! Musa 's guards . With me ! Clicking . The drone is in position . What are your orders ? He 's still inside ? Yes . The drone is now armed . Do you want to fire ? What the f ... Abort . Abort , Briggs , Carroll , get transport and get out of there . That 's an order . Carroll , fall back . - Clear ! - Clear ! I can 't . You go . - Regan 's alone . - You heard Jackson . We need to get out of here . I 'm not leaving her .

 Z ! @ ~ Am @ n : - S1-09 : Safehold Previously on " The Shannara Chronicles " ... The Ellcrys seed must be carried to a place called Safehold . To resist its force , you have to control your own . - Druiden was a fool who sent you . - Bandon ! It is the window of my sight . That 's how we find blood fire . Eretria , your body is the vessel , your blood is the key . You have to follow . Help us , and you will be free . What does the brand ? - Do not know . I have always enjoyed it . - Arion , My father ... all gone . And now you are king . Hail , King . Now we find the Preserver . There 's gotta be a way across . - There , Perhaps . The yellow line . Do you see anyone else going ? The bridge was the only one . Hope you can swim . We should not over . We shall . There is a tunnel . It 's almost dark . If there is magic down there ... Overnight you would rather have ? A tunnel flooded . Preserver . We made it . - Yeah . Then we 'll go . She is alive . Amberle liver . What did you see ? I do not know . I saw ruins . As in an ancient city . Built by humans , not elves . I did not recognize it . Was there anything else ? Tank ! - I try to . It was water . - Hav Or river ? I need to rest . - No ! Allman is almost completely bare . - If The last leaf falls ... - I know ! If you think I 'm tough , it is to prepare you . You have to harden yourself against Dagda Mor . You push me to see I cracked . It 's not funny When someone reads your thoughts , right ? Your May the force be gaining strength , but was careful how you use it . And against whom . Everything looks the same . What do you think ? I check here , so you can go that way . See you here in five minutes . Yes . If you encounter a troll , so Attack eyes . It is their weakness . I should go with you . - No . Alvstenar does not appear on the troll . - Kill Them is not your forte . It was better when you were enemies . Five minutes . Not a second later . - You Would abdikera . What a disgrace ! - Befälhavaren Have to understand . I have seen evil . If we are to survive , I need you . Your influence over the council can give us the unity we need . Your king needs you , Kael ! You 're not a king . You are left over . That went well . What did you expect ? - A Little sense . She considers himself entitled . But like all ledare fördunklas reviewed by ambition . Should I be worried ? - A Wise king is always there . Well , I said some things in Utopia ... I was angry . I apologize for that . - For Tye , for ... everything . - No danger . I was a fool . No . It 's okay to want to hear . I 've never done . - I know how it feels . I just wanted to belong somewhere . But Tye was a liar . And Cephelo ... He saved my life . The man I tried to escape from whole life . It is incomprehensible . When I was little my father came home drunk . Mom would not let him . He sat outside and screamed , and banged on the door until he passed out . I was embarrassed for him . But he was a hero . He ruined himself with magic to save us all . People are complicated . You can not blame yourself for it . But you know the truth . You know Where 'd you will . I have only questions . This you gotta see . They 're sleeping . It 's not true . Is it ... ? My tattoo . What makes your tattoo here ? - Tunneln Have lead to blood fire . Yes . There can not be a coincidence . There are three armed trolls in there . How do we get past ? We have faced worse . - Wait ... Maybe there 's another way . This can turn the war . Know the council ? Just the two of you know . Without an alliance the gnomes council goes against me . Act cautiously . There are forces who oppose the king . Kael intends to take over the throne . We have to incapacitate her and protect Anderson . It does not help . Kael is only a symptom of a lack of confidence . I have to prove myself worthy of the throne . Shall we sit and wait for a coup ? Kael Pindanon dare to Eventines not trust the king 's son . There are still honors within these walls . The letter bearing my seal. using of this we can get the support we need . I can win rĺdets confidence . They must see me as a leader . Diana , I beg you . You 're the only one I can count on . Take it to the slopes . Here it is . They 've been at it a long time . Dryers the more when the fighting starts ? It 's nothing , compared to a day with the druid . Keep your shield arm high . Then absorbed stroke of the body . The enemy is combative and totally fearless . They are ferocious attacker , but also careless . We have to be the opposite . Help me to demonstrate . - Well ... I 'm not much for fighting . - All Have to fight in this war . Show him your strength ! Do it . I take it easy . You are strong . Cranes chance . He is weak . He is weak ! You 're stronger than you look . He is not a king . Kill him now . Finish him ! Cut his throat ! Kill him . Do it ! Kill him ! - Put Down the sword . - No ! Keep him . What did you see ? I do not know . I 'm not sure . The boy is not himself . Let me talk to him . Do it . Let him go . It is as if someone had just been here . What is this place ? It feels like I 've been here before . How ? I can not explain it . What does Filii Apocalypsi ? No clue . Eretria , do you recognize sprĺket ? Eretria ? Your body is the vessel , Your blood is the key . - Did it go well ? - I think so . I heard a voice . It said that my blood is the key . - What does it mean ? - I do not know . But I saw a place . As a temple . That symbol was there ! And a light . It shone like the sun . Eretria , you saw blood fire . Sounds like as I saw in my vision . I know how we the blood to the fire . We 're close . - How do you know that ? What happened ? I can not explain it . I know the map in my blood . As if it 's a part of me . You were in my sight . Allman wanted you here . I thought it was to protect you , but sure ... why not ? Does it feel like this using alvstenarna ? I feel invincible . I usually feel bruised . So ... no . - Here it is . - No Olycksbĺdande with that , no . I feel like a pawn in a game , I do not understand . Ever since I woke up , it as if I can ... to know him . Who ? Dagda Mor . I know him inside my head . He makes me do things . What that thing want , so fight against it . And win . But what I want , then ? What do you want ? What is it ? Nothing . I just ... I 'm sorry . Forgive me , I 'm just ... I am totally exhausted . You 'll get some rest . So easy you will not have no escape . You will not escape at all . Bandon ! You 're hurting me . Stop ! Catania ! We made it . Okay ... But where is the blood of the fire ? It is here . I know it . In my view the two of you stood under the window . Wil left . And ... Nothing . I take it back . We seem to be at the right place . - What do we do now ? I do not know . We gotta get out . Do you hear ? No one comes in . - Here Is no out . - Who are you ? Blood Fire guardian . Who of you dare ... look ... the blood of the fire ? I do . Amberle Elessedil of Arborlon . Elessedil ... - Elden Possess immense forces . - It Will surely die as unworthy is . Why do you think you are worthy ? I was selected . Princess looks scared . Is it the blood of the fire ? Or to half the blood has shared her bed ? Do you know it ? Yeah , so heavy on magic so feeble shoulders . You can not protect her , half-breed . - Your Mother ... dead . - Your Father ... death . Your heart ... indecisive . No . You 're trying to confuse us . Get us to turn us against each other ... One man , the other elf . Which will it be ? What 's going on here ? I have not called to the meeting . - Do not worry . I know what you 're planning . It is already implemented . The black guards closes up . Council confirms my taking over this evening . It is treason . Imprison him . Hello ? See you ! Stay there , master . How did you find us ? - Kungen Sent me . What do Eventine about our plans ? Eventine is dead . Arion too . King Anderson has sent me here . He has assumed the throne . Not that long , maybe . The other tribes are beredda - - PL battle against the demons , not civil among elves . No one was prepared on it . Well ... you help us ? - Prinsessan Saves the world . - Prinsessan Get the boy . - Prinsessan Get everything . And so they lived happily ... They do not trust you . They feel sorry for you . As a dog . - All alone . And undesirable . You should not have it all ! Eretria , what do you do ? Put down the knife . Do not listen to them . I sacrificed my freedom . - You ? You have not sacrificed anything . The only thing you do is take . You lie and steal . You blinks seductive and sucks the life out of others . Stop . They turn the head at you . Spoiled bitch ! You would be dead without me . And you could rot the intestines on a fury ! No ! No ! Eretria , I 'm sorry . Now you know the truth . It 's either you or them . Make your choice . Eretria ... your hand . What 's happening with me ? She 's a child ... - ... Of Harmagedon . My body is a vessel My blood is the key ! Where is Catania ? She 's safe . That 's all you need to know . You took her from me . - Why ? - If You really care about her You have to let her go . He 's lying to you ! You had no right to it . - Dagda Mother exploit every weakness . Your feelings for the girl has made you vulnerable . No ... I can stand against him . Kill him ! He 's lying to you . You gotta be strong . Resist . You 're talking about my gift . You say that I am important . Then you use me and toss me aside . You sent me to that place . To my captivity . May the Demons have killed my family , but you 've taken everything else . All I did was to protect the four countries and you . You are just a displaced soul from the words of dead men . Maybe it 's time to accompany them ! This is not you , Bandon . No , Allanon . That 's me. stronger than anyone could have imagined . Stronger than you even ! I 'm sorry for everything I 've done .

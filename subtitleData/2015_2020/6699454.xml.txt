 No ! My purge playlist . I 'm having a lot of fun to it . Especially this final tune . As it is , it will be the last song you ever hear . Tough choice . Then I thought of George Clinton , the King of Interplanetary Funklinship . George is psychedelic rock if you 're feeling a little funky obviously . And soulful , which is the least that I can do . Now , I played a lot of purge games tonight . We 've just one more . It 's simple and effective . It 's called " Mummy 's Choice " . Mummy , which one of you will survive this year 's purge ? This is just one of a dozen protests around our capital after reports emerged caliming that the new founding fathers have been using the Purge to help their own economic agenda in a recent statement by the incendiary purge detractor , Bishop Dante . For the past 20 years , the NFFA has taken to legalize murder to decrease the poor population which , in turn , keeps the government spending down . Less welfare , less healthcare and less housing . Recent polling suggested that growing of anti-purge sentiments may have a monumental effect on the upcoming presidential election . Establishment NFFA candidate , Minister Edwidge Owens has been losing ground to wildcard independent candidate , Senator Charley Roan . Eighteen years ago , Roan was forced to watch the brutal execution of her entire family on purge night . And entered the political arena soon after with one goal in mind ; to put an end to the annual holiday . I have no doubt that the soul of our country is at stake . The Purge has to come to an end . Senator Roan is proving to be the greatest threat to the NFFA regime since they first took office 25 years ago . Is the cunt that close ? All the polls have her a point behind . I 'm sorry , Caleb . I .. No need to be sorry , Minister . You are doing a great job . Let us put you where you need to be . Thomas . We have our people out there countering all these entire NFFA bullshit . What else can we do ? We do whatever it fucking takes ! I 've had it with all these idealistic pigs . They want the impossible . Everyone to have . Some cannot have . Not enough to go around . It 's time to do something about all these cocksuckers like that rat , Bishop , and the cunt Senator . Trying to dismantle everything we built . We are going to use this year 's purge to do some spring-cleaning , gentlemen . And where will you be spending tonight , Minister ? I will once again be presiding over my party 's midnight purge Mass because I still believe in them . The midnight purge Mass where our great NFFA leaders gather together and slaughter innocents . Is murder our new religion ? Senator . Murder 's our new religion ? Snappy . Now , the midnight purge Mass is where NFFA leaders gather to celebrate the night which saved this country from economic ruin . We have other ways . Now , America is built on sacrifice . From the revolution all the way until World War II . Our forefathers sacrificed themselves . Everybody look alive . Understandably , we watched them . Must sacrifice every year in order to rid ourselves ... You know what I said . She moves , we move . Now the stats are undeniable . There has been far less crime ... This is crap . So I have to listen to this ? Send me to the principal 's office . I can 't listen to this anymore . Okay , we 'll send you to the principal 's office if you can 't keep your mouth shut . More low-income people are killed during the Purge than anyone else . The money generated from the purge line the pockets of the NRA and insurance companies . Any government system that relies on violence to answer its problems must be ... She 's doing good , Leo . It 's time to call upon the better angels of our nature . At least , we will keep trying . Jesus Christ , here she goes again . Secure the audience . I 'm on it . I 'd like to talk to you guys . Well , at least he was doing it , boss . She 's no good to anyone dead . You got it , Leo , Okay , we 're on the move . Copy that . Please sit down . I 'd like to stay here with you for the rest of the night . Stay cool and keep it tight . For purge and purifying . For purge and purifying . Hi , thanks . As she 'd done many times before , Senator Roan broke security protocol walking off the stage ... I 'll tell you this much . She got some little tits but she 's got some big assed balls . She ain 't got no snowball chance on steambath in winning this thing , but she 'll be taking on ' em all those white-haired George Washington wannabe mofo 's all by herself . And to that , I say bully for her . Oh , horse shit . She 's full of it too . Nothing 'll ever change . Hey , Laney . Laney , Laney , I think we offend Marcos with our anti senator talk . The senator 's going to win . It doesn 't mean it 'll be changes too . You see . All she need is Florida . She gets the 29 electoral votes from Florida , that will take her to over 270 . She can do it . Smartass . All that useless shit can 't buttered them bagel correctly . I can butter your bagel , boss . Oh , you 're butter my bagel ? Well , you got a joke over there . Yes , you just be careful , kid , with all that hope because it can be a bad thing . Hope can lead to a lot of letdown . Tell him I 'm Irish , huh ? Excuse me , what ? I 'm not paying attention . I 'm thinking about waffle and pussy . That 's all I really think about actually . Irish Ike , ladies and gentlemen . What are you laughing at ? I 'm damn serious . The new founding fathers believe in fairness . And we hear what the people are saying . That the purge benefits the rich and the powerful . It was never the intention . From this point on , no one is exempt . The rules protecting Level 10 government officials Yeah , come in . had been revoked . Are you seeing this ? The NFFA is revoking the purge rules that protects government officials of ranking 10 on purge night . Yeah , I 'll secure the safehouse and full security detail on that night . No , I 'm staying home on purge night . Senator , I don 't think that 's a good idea . If the voters get wind that I 'm hiding in a fortress like some rich asshole , I 'll lose votes and NFFA wins . I 'll stay home like 99 % of the population . Make it safe , whatever it takes . Right . Half the price on all the masks . Come on inside . The purge is halloween for adults ! Hordes of young adults are arriving from Spain , Denmark , South Africa . They 're being called " murder tourists " because they 're here for one reason . To purge . We have to experience the purge . To kill . Release of the anger and hate . Like the Americans . We 're very excited . [ Speaking Danish ] Foreigners coming to our capital to kill . Murder tourism , a new building business in our country this year . Murder tourism . What 's happened to our country , Joe ? Mrs Sabian , I wish I knew . You take care of yourself , Mrs S. Next time you need something , just give us a call . I 'll have Marcos run it over , saving you a trip , okay ? I come by to flirt with you , Joe . What ? No one can take that from me . Ah , you better get out of here . Get out of here . Get out of here . Oh , yes . Now , she 's nasty . Oh , I like you . She 's nasty . That 's a nasty woman . Joe , come here . Sonabitch . Where 's he gone ? I 've never saw him move so damn fast . Alright , girls . Give it up . I won 't have to call the police . Just get out of our face , old man . Let 's not do this the hard way , okay ? I 'm giving you a way out . Right ? Give up the candy or I 'll have to take it away from you . You touch me and I 'll screamed rape , you cocksucking pig . Now , walk away . Give it back . Who are you , bitch ? Better get out of my way ! That 's Laney Rucker , Kimmy . Laney Rucker ? No shit . Oh , the queen badass ? Yo , they call you the " redeemer " . " Near death " . You 're my motherfucking hero . That makes me proud . Now give back whatever you stole . And apologize . Oh , my God .. Sorry Mister . I am just playing . So , Miss Rucker what happened to you ? You look all ... whitish now . Later , Miss Rucker . Wish I 'd met you back in the day . Excuse me . Uh , well .. You are lot more respectful then when you were shoplifting here . You know , I distinctly remember one time you call me " sir " . Oh , bullshit . But listen , I just wanna say thank you . You 're my family , Joe . I appreciate it . Thank you , Laney . I want men in there . I want men in there . I want a lot of men back there . She 's got some security but I moved back the entire team . I want barricades on all the doors , all the windows , back and front . Looks safe . Chief , if you tell me it 's safe one more time , I 'm gonna throw you down the steps . Please don 't do that . Men here . Men here . We 've got a security monitoring system in this room . We 've got eyes and ears on everything . This is her saferoom . She is not to leave her saferoom . No one is to go inside her saferoom . Do we understand each other ? This is a mess . She 's nopt gonna be happy about it . I don 't care if she 's happy , Chief . I want to go on record to say this is a bad idea . No matter what we do here , this house and the Senator are at risk on purge night . You understand me ? Duly noted . Let 's lock it down . " Let 's lock it down . " . It 's just me and you , pal . Tell me what you want me to do , I 'm here . Go downstairs . Make sure they take care of the doors . Keep an eye on that guy . Done . The NFFA has created predatorial capitalism . Profit is the esence of democracy . We come to DC to make some changes . Joe 's deli . Excuse me ? Wait , wait , wait . Hold on . Wait a minute . Why are you raising my rates now ? Today . You know what today is ? Yes but , look , I .. I can 't afford that . What do you mean you 're sorry ? Yes , I 'm talking to you . Let me speak to your sup ... Your sup ... Son of a bitch . Son of a bitch ! Joe ? What the hell 's going on ? Damn insurance company . They 'd just raised the premium of my purge coverage by thousands . The say before the day of purge . If I don 't pay it by tomorrow , I have no purge coverage for this store . They can 't do that . Yeah , but they just did . Just lock the place down , Joe . Yeah , but that 's not enough . If I have no insurance , I am screwed . I just have to protect this place myself . Are you crazy ? That 's not a good idea , boss . Listen , we love this place as you do , Joe . I 've been coming here since I was born . But it 's just stuff . It can be replaced . You can 't be . Yeah , but what about what you do on purge night , Laney ? Huh ? Is that not the pot calling the kettle brown , no ? That 's different , Joe , and you know that . I 'm protected . And you won 't be . This ... This is all I 've got , guys . This is my slice of the pie . Man , I cannot . I can 't lose this place . I just ... I can 't lose this place . Come on , Joe . Let 's talk about this . Everything is in place . The team 's in position . 10 minutes to lockdown , boys . Hey , mamma . You ready ? Yeah . Vaya condios . Okay , let 's go . Okay . This is gonna be your home for the next 12 hours . If you need anything , you contact me , and me only . Clear ? Clear . Let 's begin . This is not a test . This is your Emergency Broadcast system . Announcing the commencement of the annual " purge " sanctioned by the US government . Commencing at the siren , any and all crime , including murder , will be legal for 12 continuous hours . Here we go . Police , fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7.00 a.m. And for the first time since its inception , no one has been granted special immunity from the purge . No citizen or group will be exempt . Blessed be our new founding fathers and America , a nation reborn . May God be with you all . I see you , Bobby . You know , you can relax now , right ? I 'll relax in the morning . Am I interrupting ? Senator , you should be in the den . I want to thank you for being here tonight . My pleasure . Leo , have drink with me . You don 't have a choice .

No . No horse-shit . I want real answer . I lost my son some years ago . He was killed . I must have done something on night purge that would have destroyed a lot of lives . I want this night gone . I know you did too . Especially , after what you 've lost . Yeah . But despite all that , you you 're having problems with how I do things . You take risks , senator . My job is to eliminate risks and keep you alive . You don 't make that easy . The soul of this country is at stake , Leo . The only way I can win is to risk .. ... everything . And that includes my life . Well .. It is time to purge ! Come on ! I hope your night of fun . Don 't you see we 're working ? Hey ! Asshole ! Just go wait right here and see what happens . Purge !

God , I hate that she sounds going like that . Stop , stop ! What .. ? What is this ? Some kind of homegrown militia ? Those are skilled mercs . A lot of money behind it .

What did you do in Mexico ? I try to survive . What 're you doing out on purge night ? Protecting the deli against looters because my boss lost his purge insurance yesterday . Yeah , that 's something you can look into , Senator . Insurance company screwing the working man . Yeah ? What 's your name , pal ? You know what , Mr Secret Service man . You should be thanking my black ass for helping you instead of interrogating me . His name is Joe Dixon . Joe Dixon , did I offended you ? Yeah , friend . Just a little bit . Your feeling is not a concern of mine . Everyone . Shut up , please ! Look ! Come out , you bitch ! Sound the alert and start the fire ! Oh hell . Who the hell is that ? The looters I was telling you about . It 's purge night , senator . What so you expect ? Hey , you fuck ! I 'm back ! And I brought some friends . And I 'm gonna get that candy bar . They have chainsaws and they 're coming inside . All right , I gotta get you out of here . Yeah , but they 're at both entrances .

I 'm staying . They 'll kill you . Go now ! If you stay , I stay . Just leave ! Joe , listen to me . For some reason , the Senator ended up in my neighbourhood and your deli . Maybe it 's our duty to help protect her . We 'll rebuild the deli , whatever it takes , you and me . I promise . Come on , guys . Now ! Where are we headed ? Underground triage centre service in the community . It 's completely secure . Extend our perimeter . They 're on foot . They can 't be far . Earl , spoke with the ground units . Tommy regained consciousness . Said he had a shot off at the senator 's security . He thinks the bullet is lodged in his shoulder . How the hell did it get to this ? Who is he ? Why is he cuffed ? Rondo . Two bullet holes delivered by a rival gang , but he 's a good kid . He 's chained up because I didn 't want him to purge anymore . So , Senator ... NFFA made a move on your ass . Seems that way . Goddamn conniving , duplicities , crooked , cocksucking politicians . Agree . We 're not all that bad . From my experience , Senator , might be better on your own . No matter what you all say or promise .. I 'm partly confused too . Who the hell is this lady ? You big dope . You gave people from the neighborhood a bad name . Oh , it 's just some purgers . It 's cross fire . Not for us . Ah , it feels like you 're close . How do you know each other ? Joe gave me the job seven years ago when I first came here from Mexico . I 've been working for him ever since . And you ? Joe 's been looking out for me since I was a little kid . And he helps me get out of life . Sounds like Joe is a saint . Yeah . Well , I ain 't no saint . I 'm just doing my part . Driving round in a van , on the purge night , helping people ? It 's pretty dangerous . I 'm working for a triage unit alone . It 's true , for most part . Seriously , Laney . Who the hell are these people ? Down ! Everyone down ! Anybody hit ? I 'm okay , I 'm okay . You sure ? Yeah . Laney . I 'm okay . Jesus Christ ! Rondo 's dead . What the fuck was that ? They 've found the senator . I want you to turn left ! Go on to the freeway . Move ! Move ! Tonight ! The gates of hell will always be in a fight to the end . The survival of the fucking fittest . Who 's the fittest ? ! I 'm the fittest of them all ! Ow , fuck . Don 't lose them under there . Ground Unit . Get your asses moving and get here now . We 've got them cornered . Turn here and stop . So we just wait here ? No . They 'll have units on the ground . They 'll gonna be all over us . Yeah , but we all better figure out fast cause I don 't like it here . It doesn 't make sense . There was no way they could have known that we have this van . It doesn 't matter . They did . You son of a bitch . Leo ? Leo ? Move over . Leo ? Oh . Leo , what the hell are you doing ? Leo , you ... Tracer bullet . That 's how you notice . Just leave it here and drive away . They 'll never know we left it . Yeah , well , I wish it was that simple . You all need to see this . There 's a whole bunch of negroes coming right this way . And we 're sitting here like a bucket of motherfucking chicken . What 's your ETA ? 2 minutes , Earl . Open the motherfucking door ! What are we gonna do ? They 'll start blasting if we move . They 'll start blasting if we don 't . Hey , now what are we going to do ? What 's the plan ? No , no , no . Calm down . Calm down . What the hell is that ? I know what I heard , I know what I heard . I told you I ain 't no saint . Everybody 's got a past . That was a Crip 's whistle . They just threw it back . If this is what I said , we should be good . I know , I know what I heard . Alright . We 're not going to hurt you . Just help my fucking boy . He 's gonna die . We help you . Can you do something for us ? They 're still under the overpass but they 're on the move . Get your asses in there . They 've stopped . Stop the truck . We 're going on foot . Clear ! Earl , we found a tracer bullet . But there was no sign of the target . Yeah , we 're heading back . Rondi , come in . Rondi , come in . Come in . I need a fucking sitrep . Fuck you , motherfuckers ! No one following . We 're clear . We are a few blocks away . I 'm gonna call in and tell them we have a special guest . Where are we ? You 're safe . What is this place ? We call this the safe zone . Senator . Dante Bishop . Mr. Bishop . This is Angel . Dawn call and told me you guys are coming through . So NFFA came messing tonight . Can 't say I 'm surprised . Let me show you around . Get yourself a den . You set all this up , Mr. Bishop ? Yes , this is my organization . We have doctors , nurses , EMTs and paramedics . This is their way of protesting this day and night . How many people know about this place ? Just the volunteers . And all those that we invite in . Look , these are the real victims of the Purge . The people that the NFFA are trying to eliminate . So that they don 't have to take care of them anymore . These men . They 're armed . Are they guarding all the entrances and the rooftop ? Yes . My people will keep you safe . Or as safe as you can be on purge night . I appreciate it . Mr. Bishop . Yeah . Thank you for all of this . I am ... impressed . Well , don 't thank me . Thank the volunteers . Mr. Bishop . I 've heard stories ... of tactics that you will employ on the purge night . I can 't say that I agree with any of it . Tell you what . You get elected . You stop this night and I don 't have to do what I do anymore . Let 's go , Angel . Fair enough . Get down to Fourth street . Keep an eye out . Keep watch and be quiet . All right , let 's go ! Come on . I want access to the surveillance cameras in the city . Do a grid search for the fucking triage van . It 's out there somewhere . Find it . Boss . You 're doing the right thing . Yeah ? But it 's time to go . And get back to the deli . What ? No . Are you fucking crazy ? We 're safe here . Laney , you know I 'll walk back if I have to . Fine . I 'll drive you . But if we ran into any problems , we 're coming right back here . Deal . Is it true ? You can do that ? We 'll see her again , Marcos . Well , she 's safe here . Let 's hit it . I don 't know if you find it amazing but I think it 's cool . Hey . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm okay . I 'm gonna go take a look around . Okay . Stay here . Okay , boss . What are you doing here ? Hand . Why are you here ? What the hell going on here ? He slipped in here . Hey , hey . Okay , okay . Hey ! Hey ! It 's alright . It 's alright . Rev , back up . It 's okay . Just put the gun down , alright ? Everybody 's okay . Backup . We 're okay . Alright ? Alright ? You 're good . It 's all good , okay ? I 'll just get my weapon . What 's going on ? Just doing my job . Senator , this is just a misunderstanding . Why don 't we go back outside ? Come on . You seeing this , Leo ? Yes , ma 'am . Senator , why don 't we go outside ? Stop . Those are the Minister 's biggest financial supporters . The NFFA . Our Lady Of Sorrow . Senator , why ... Is ... Is that where the Minister going to be tonight ? For the purge mass ? We believe so . You sure ... What 's is all this ? Why do you have all this ? You 're going to assasinate him . You 're going to assasinate the Minister tonight , aren 't you ? You know , somebody got to say it out loud . What in the fool happened tonight ? Nobody 's gonna believe it . No . I wish I could be , like , bullshit . Now , where can my waffle and ... pussy ... He had a one track mind . That boy had lost his head . Shit . I hope he 's okay tonight . Yeah . Hold on , guys . Look . Those are government trucks . I saw them on Youtube from last year 's purge .

His church will be locked up like Fort Knox . You 'll never get through . You 'll be slaughtered . Fourth Church will be on that side .

The tunnel of the original church have been closed up since the 50s . But we re-open it . We 'll gonna walk right through there and into the church without anybody even knowing .

We need to focus on one thing right now , and that 's survival . I need to make sure you get through this tonight . I have to stop them from killing a minister ? What ? If they assasinate Edwidge , he becomes a martyr . We lose . Yeah , and how do we do that ? I don 't know . We have to do something . Do what ? Do what ? You want to risk your life saving the guy 's hide ... Everybody alright ? Leo , you okay ? He 's okay . Damn ! Oh , my God ! I know where they 're taking her . I know why she 's still alive . Where ?

Blessed be the new founding fathers . Let us purge and cleanse our souls . Blessed be America . A nation reborn . It 's been a long journey to get away from the lies and self-deception . To this place of knowledge and awareness of who we really are . People flesh immensely deformed . Oh , it 's hard to see the ugly truth , but change can only come from acceptance And change we must as it is our godly duty to get rid of the fury and the hatred that poisons our souls , makes us sick ! Make us ugly ! Tonight , we the leaders of this great country will sin , scour , sanitize and sterilize our souls until we are free again , and this country will be better purged . We are not hypocrites ! We practice what we preach . Purge and purify , say it with me . Purge and purify . Purge and purify . Purge and purify . Let 's us begin . Now , look . It 's after midnight .

Trying to get yourself killed ? That 's the tunnel to the cathedral ? How the fuck do you know about the tunnel ? I asked you a question . This is no longer assasination . It 's a rescue mission . Jesus died for their sins ! Do not try you dare touch me ! And now our modern day martyrs , would die for our pleasure . Do not disturb him ! Our martyr 's name is Lawrence . A life-long drug addict . He wants to make amends . He wants to serve his god and his government . Let 's thank Lawrence for his gift . Thank you , Lawrence ! I love you ! Thank you very much .

That was Senator Roan this morning casting the first vote of the day . It 's been a great day for the senator so far having already won New York , California , and ... wait , hold on , I am getting word right now . That the senator has also taken Florida which puts her well over the 270 electoral votes for the win . So , that is it . It is now official . The next president of the United States will be Charlie Roan . And president-elect Roan already stated that her first order of business will be taking executive action to put an end to the Purge . Updates ? With a landslide . Alright , I 'll come by tomorrow . We can get started on the ceiling . Sounds good . The place is really coming along , Marcos . Joe will be really happy . I 'll catch you later , kid . We 're just now hearing reports about a few scattered incidents around the country where NFFA supporters are reacting violently to this defeat . They are burning cars , breaking windows , riot , attacking police officers ...

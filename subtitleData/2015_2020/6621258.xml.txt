 ( Regan ) Previously on " Hunters . " ( Jackson ) Abby Carroll , reported missing less than 24 hours after her picture was sent to the Mexican cell . She 's also married to an FBI agent . You think terrorists kidnapped my wife . She 's a piano teacher . ( Jackson ) The terrorists we 're chasing aren 't human . ( screaming ) You 're one of them . I tore that woman to shreds like an animal . I need the treatment . ( machine buzzing ) The treatment weakens you . I need you strong . I won 't let them have another one . ( baby crying , bone snapping ) The baby 's not breathing , help me ! ( Flynn ) They took my wife . Or your wife 's a Hunter . Where the hell are they ? ! Strieber Self Storage . Near the farmhouse . Unit 470 . ( groans , panting ) ( Jackson ) Then we 're certain the body is entirely human ? ( Dr. James ) From what I can observe , yes . But I can 't perform a full autopsy until the subject 's thawed . You mean , Abby . She 's not a fu ... subject . She 's my wife . ( Dr. James ) I 'm afraid we can 't determine that yet either , Flynn . A human body takes 72 hours to freeze solid . So , we know this victim died more than three days ago . Beyond that , we can 't determine time of death until the autopsy . So , she could 've been killed months ago , even years . The Abby you know may not have been human . Do you people realize how ridiculous you sound ? ( Dr. James ) Not so ridiculous . If the Hunters have been using tissue samples to assume human form . No , they kidnapped Abby , a human so they could kill her . And then use her ... It 's just a theory , Flynn . There 's no way to prove it yet . Sure there is . Thaw Abby 's body . - We can 't rush it . - Like hell . Just thaw the body . Figure out ... how long she 's been dead . Get some heaters in here . Please , I need to know . If we introduce external sources of heat , it could damage the tissue and affect test results . Then we wait . It 's been a long day , Flynn . Go home , be with Emme . ( quiet sobbing ) That 's my wife . ( announcer ) Seems to be feeling the pressure here . The pitcher calls time ... If you just joined us , the O 's trail by one ... ( woman ) How long you been home ? A few months . So , what was it like ? - What ? - The war . Was it scary ? Did you see any , like , real live terrorists ? Did you ever kill anyone ? No . It was just a bunch of camels and shit . It was awesome , awesome . Do you wanna get out of here ? I 've got to use the little girls ' room . Then I think we should go . ( crowd laments ) ( woman giggles ) ( door creaks ) ( game continues on TV ) ( gunfire ) ( baseball bat striking , crowd roars ) ( woman sniveling ) ( announcer ) We have a ballgame now , folks . The crowd are really giving it up ... ( crowd roars ) You can 't leave now . The O 's just tied the game . Leaving the bar now is sacrilege . The baseball gods demand that you stay put . ( chuckling ) Abby . I 'll ride the pine with ya . Flynn . Garcon , what he 's having . - Whiskey . - Mm-hmm . - ( laughing ) - Lots ... lot 's of whiskey . ( Emme ) I didn 't disappear . I wanted to play piano . There 's no piano at the school so I went to find one . I 'm sorry . Emme , there 's something I ... I need to tell you . ( sighs ) I think of you like my own daughter . Something 's happened . Abby 's gone . I know that already . No . No , I mean , she 's ... dead . She 's dead . We found her body last night . You 're wrong , that isn 't her . - Emme ... - You made a mistake . ( sighs ) Abby isn 't dead , I know she isn 't . I was with her yesterday . What ? What ? Where ? We met at a coffee shop in DC . Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa . You just told me you went to play piano . I know , I lied . But only because I was with Abby . She can 't be dead , why are you saying that ? How did , how , how ... what ? How did you find her ? Did she contact you ? She sent me a playlist on Spotify . What ? Why ? Cool piano stuff . Did she tell you where she was staying ? Or why she left ? No . Just that she loved me , that ... That she 's safe , Flynn . I don 't need to worry about her anymore . I want you to email her back . Tell her it 's an emergency . And that I wanna see her . I can 't do that . I promised her I wouldn 't tell you . Emme , listen to me . This is very important . If you 're telling me the truth and Abby 's out there , I need to find her now . ♪ I am calling for you ♪ ♪ You are why ♪ ♪ I 'm still breathing here ♪ ( Tasha speaking Romanian from computer ) ( Hunter baby clicking ) Play it again .

Hella random if you ask me . - Are you able to make anything out ? - Bits and pieces . Lights and shapes that I don 't recognize . That don 't make sense . But this one keeps repeating . The same symbol you got off the Hunter in Colombia . Both McCarthy and the dying mother said it a bunch of times . And wherever they 're holding them , I hope they know just what they 're dealing with . I underestimated his strength . And mine . I would 've killed him for what he did to that baby . Take a break . We 'll go back over the recordings again later . Good work , agents . ( footsteps leaving ) ( Regan ) Will it look like a human when it grows up ? ( Dr. James ) Or some sort of hybrid . I won 't let them have another one . ( screaming ) ( cell phone vibrating ) Yeah ? Do you see her ? - Not yet . - If she shows up , just tell her you hacked my computer . I 'm a hacker , got it .

( phone beeps ) ( shutter clicking ) ( traffic honking ) ( shutter clicking ) ( Jules ) Just got this pic from Carroll .

Driver got lucky , got a shot off . A human driver ? They were all human . What did you do ? We 'll talk about this later . ( door beeps ) ( door closes , beeps ) We need to proceed with caution . He has friends in very high places . And a suitcase full of drug money . A dangerous combination . ( door beeping ) Mr. Seraphin , my name is Agent Jackson . Jackson ? I thought all Jacksons were singers or ball players . You were recently in Colombia ? If Homeland Security or whoever you are needs to speak with me , you should 've made an appointment with my office . We 're not in the business of scheduling appointments .

She gave you this suitcase . Are you aware of its contents ? Who is she ? Her name 's Erika . A girlfriend of mine , one of several . She and that bag of money are none of your damn business . Oh , it is if you 're laundering money for terrorists . Ooh , there it is . You have no jurisdiction over me . If you want to query it out , you can take it up with the White House . We 're gonna need access to whatever accounts this money was intended for . All of my accounts are sealed . Diplomatic privileges along with my communications . I have suffered a criminal assault at the hands of your goons . By the time your request to access my accounts has been denied , I 'll have you and everyone in this building in handcuffs .

" ( heavy sigh ) ( Flynn ) Hey . Wow , hot stuff . ( sighing ) What happened to my bag ? Guess I was more stressed than I thought . Sorry . No , it 's these guns . You don 't even know your own strength . I 'll pay for a new one , I promise . It 's just a stupid bag . - Yeah . - I don 't care about any of this stuff . Well , except for her . ( laughs ) Now I just care about being with you . You happy to be here , aren 't you ? Of course I am . It 's just ... It 's hard ... being away from my old life . The people back home , everything I ever knew . Sometimes I don 't know who I am anymore . Come here . You 're the girl who saved my life . Thank you . All right , come on . Give me your best shot . Let her rip , tiger , come on ! Ooh . That 's the best you can do ? You have no idea . Oh , yeah ? Come on . Prove it . The day you moved in . The cake . What did it say ? " Home is where the Harley is . " And it was German chocolate . I baked it for you myself . No . How do I know you didn 't transfer Abby 's memories to you with some alien mind thing , huh ? We can 't do that , it 's impossible . So , you can switch bodies and build spaceships but not that . I was there , Flynn . I swear . It was all me . Hold out your arm . Hold out your arm . Don 't make me shoot you . ( Flynn grunting ) ( wavering ) Towel , please ? ( both panting ) ( kissing ) You can touch it . ( snickers ) Three months since we met . How come you never asked me about it ? Figured you 'd tell me when you were ready . Most people , it 's usually the first thing out of their mouths . I 'm not most people . No . You 're definitely not . Afghanistan . My unit was guarding a supply convoy when we got hit high on both sides . They forced us into the rocks . Bastards were fast . Knew the canyon like the back of their hands 'cause we couldn 't hit any of them . Then they got us . ( taking deep breath ) They put us in this pit . Then they pulled us out one-by-one . I was the last . They yanked me out . Held me down . Next thing I remember I was getting picked up on the side of the road by some skinny private from Tucson telling me how lucky I was . I 'm so sorry , that 's awful . Ten guys in my unit , and only two of us made it out alive . It doesn 't make any fu ... sense . You 're a survivor , Flynn . I only keep on going because of you . Me too . You 're all I 've got . ( kissing ) ( heavy breathing ) I love you . You shouldn 't have come looking for me . Why didn 't you tell me the truth ? Think how you would 've reacted . Other Hunters did . Randall Slavich . And look what happened to his wife . I was trying to protect you . I don 't need protection , I need the truth . Why did you pick me ? You 're an FBI agent . - There 's thousands of agents . - You were working narcotics . So is everyone else in my unit . Reyes ... Kevin . What did you do to him ? Nothing . So help me . I will splatter your gray guts against that couch and not think twice . Did you kill my partner ? No . - Did you kill him ? - No ! But I was stealing information from him on drug investigations . You and him . Funneling it to McCarthy . To build the Hunter drug trade . Kevin started suspecting . He started calling me . Asking questions . McCarthy killed him to shut him up . I 'm sorry , Flynn . I 'm so sorry . After we took Emme in , I fell in love with her , too . That 's why I had to see her yesterday . If you loved her so much ... then why did you leave ? They wanted me out , said I 'd " gone native . " - McCarthy ? - Everyone . But I refused to come in . I had a family , you and Emme . I couldn 't imagine living without you even if it meant being someone I never really was . I wanted you more . I still do . ( clicking ) They 're here . They 're coming for us . ( clicking ) ( grunts , clicking ) I can hear the Feelers . Feelers are Hunters ? They 're Brother servants , his eyes and ears . They can sense other Hunters . - Through the walls ? - Walls don 't stop our language . That won 't stop them either . Give me my gun . Fine , you can do it , shoot me . Right here . It 'll be painful but I 'll survive . They need to think that I put up a fight , and that 's how you escaped . Do it and go . I could kill you . You won 't . Do it . ( clicking ) Do it . Why ? Why did the Hunters target me ? And don 't give me that FBI bullshit . Why ? Because you lived when you should 've died . Do it . ( clicking ) Shoot me , do it . I lied about Kevin . I 'm the one who killed him . You said it was McCarthy . Your friend , your partner . He begged for his life , and I shot him in the face . It was lies , all of it . Your hands on me , having you inside me . I hated every second . I never loved you . I used you . ( whispers ) Do it . Do it . - Do it ! - ( gunshot ) ( clicking ) ( clicking ) ( high pitched clicks ) ( Abby sobbing ) Our NSA contacts won 't touch Seraphin because he 's IMF . Now what ? Do we contain him ? No , no , we need to get it out of him directly , bank accounts , passwords , whatever we can . If he 's laundering money for the Hunters ... Then he 's in contact with their leadership . - Brother Number Four . - Mm . The woman he was with might be a ... go-between . And given Flynn 's call this morning , I have an idea who that might be . ( door beeps ) We 've found a paper trail ( door closes ) linking your Colombian connection to a terrorist organization . Oh , here 's me thinking this coffee was the start of my apology . Is this Erika ? Have you ever noticed anything unusual on her skin ? Like this , perhaps ? I don 't know what that is . Well , that 's a skin condition that , uh , members of their species get . Species ? These are , are fake . This , this is absurd . See , I don 't know what kind of game you 're play ... ( Jackson , distorted ) This is what you 've been sleeping with . And these things that you 've been laundering money for , they 're ... ( sighs ) ( Richard ) What did you do to me ? Richard ... Can I call you Richard ? You gave me something in my coffee . I need access to all of your records . Bank accounts , your emails . I need all your passwords . And I need them now . Here , take these . Now , there you go . And in a bizarre turn of events , Richard Seraphin , the Director for Global Asset Management for the International Monetary Fund who was reported missing yesterday is currently undergoing medical assessment . Seraphin was picked up by DC police this morning claiming he 'd been taken prisoner by a secret government organization and had been sleeping with an alien sex spy . Scopolamine in his coffee ? Elicits hallucinations and confessions . Straight from the company playbook . Hidden history of mental illness . Ellsberg was before your time . Nixon 's finest hour . I know my U.S. history . ( Jackson ) Carroll and Abby ? She 's gone again with the wind . You let her escape ? I don 't know . There was blood in the hotel room . - Hunter blood ? - Mm . Gone before local PD got there ? Spick-and-span , won 't be your Watergate . I 'll start sorting through the Seraphin intel with Jules . Mm . A sum of money that large can only be controlled from the top . Brother Number Four . Find me the link . How 's her arm ? It 'll be fine . Must 've been quite a hit . I bounce back . You gave yourself the treatment . The urges haven 't stopped . I understand that , but the treatment makes you vulnerable . I don 't care . Well , you should , this unit needs you . To be a weapon . Do you really believe that 's the only reason you 're here ? I 'm not like the other Hunters , I 'm not an animal . Of course you 're not . And I 'm not your pet either . Or your toy solder or your experiment . I care about your safety , your well-being , and I 've always tried to treat you as if you were one of my ... One of my own . You 're an Elder at your temple . You and your family attend service every Sunday . Your faith and your family are the most important things in your life . But you 've never once asked me to come with you because I 'm not human . My soul isn 't worth saving . That is , if you really think I have one . Allison , I 'm sorry , I didn 't even know you were interested . Don 't worry about it . You 've got your faith to soothe you . I 've got a machine . You didn 't call back . ( grunts ) I couldn 't , not right away . Did you see her ? ( sighing ) No . She never showed up , Emme , I 'm sorry . I didn 't lie . I know . I believe you , but that wasn 't the Abby we knew . But it was . It wasn 't . She 's gone , Emme . We have to let her go . Both of us . I don 't believe it . That 's normal . That 's the first stage of grief . And then what ? Then it 's anger . Or ... or bargaining . I don 't remember . There are seven stages ... - I better look it up . - Yeah . I need to get this right for her . I found it . Kübler-Ross stages of grief . Will you memorize these with me ? There aren 't seven stages , there 's five . Number one . Denial . Number two : anger . Number three ... bargaining . Number four : depression . Number five ... Acceptance . ( clicking ) My Feelers , you have returned to your Brother . ( clicking ) You found her . Show me . ( clicking and indistinct whispering ) ( choking , coughing )

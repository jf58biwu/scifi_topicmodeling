 Previously on " The 100 " ... Your bone marrow can get us back to the ground . They 'll never stop . They 'll never stop . She took the deal . We 've won . They 're surrendering ? Not quite . What about prisoners from the Ark ? They 'll all be killed , but you don 't care about that , do you ? The duty to protect my people comes first . _ Let me help them . _ Please don 't leave me here . It can 't be over . Jaha : Our ancestors used a missile to destroy the world . We 're gonna use one to get back to it . Take this leap of faith with me , John Murphy . This is our destiny . What the hell is that ? Jaha : It 's a drone . We 're gonna follow it . The City of Light is out there , and we are gonna find it . Now get in the boat . [ Grunting ] Yo , Ahab . Come back . Get some rest . I 'm fine . Oh , screw this . If you 're not gonna sleep , you can row . Get back on that oar , Craig . Or what ? We don 't even know if we 're going in the right direction anymore . We followed that drone across the open ocean . Hell , we deserve to die out here . Murphy : It 's ok , it 's ok . I 'm good to go . I can row . Richards : Land ? Land ! Ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! - Yeah ! - Ha ha ha ! How does an Island of Light sound to you , John , huh ? Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! [ Thud ] - Oh ! - Damn it ! What was that ? Get that oar . Get that oar . Richards ! There 's something in the water ! The oar ! [ Growling ] Aah ! Ah ! [ Roaring ] My arm . Oh , my arm . I don 't see it . Where is it ? Richards ! Richards ! What the hell was that thing ? We need to row now . [ Slam ] It 's back . Hold on ! - Where is it ? - Craig , row . - Row , Craig ! - Where is it ? [ Slam ] Craig , row ! We 're gonna sink . We 're all gonna die . We 're all gonna die . I can do it . I can row . Go ! Row ! Aah ! Hey , what the hell is wrong with you ? Get off of me ! Get off of me ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! What the hell is ... what the hell is wrong with you ? Hold on . It 's gone . Let 's go . Why ? So we could live . And because you can row . [ Alarm blaring ] It 's about time . Fox . [ Running footsteps ] Octavia . You stayed . Screw you . Of course I stayed . I know where my loyalties lie . We have to get in there . If that was possible , do you think I 'd still be out here ? Why did Lexa sound the retreat ? She made a deal with Mount Weather , freed the Grounders , and now we 're on own . Stop ! They 'll know we 're here . What about Lincoln ? There 's no way he would have gone along with a plan like this . He didn 't , they took him . What 's wrong with you ? I am getting through that door . And that 's your plan ? Bellamy 's counting on you . Everyone 's always counting on you . Well , what do you want from me ? You trusted Lexa . You let a bomb drop on Tondc . You let all those people ... I am doing the best I can ! Yeah ? Well , it 's not good enough . [ Beep ] [ Door opens ] Oh , Bellamy . Ha ! I knew it . You two are too scrawny to drill . Hey . Ohh ! Heh . Bellamy : It 's all right . She 's with us . Where 's your army ? Gone just like yours . Say you have a plan . Not really . We need to talk to Dante . Maya says he 's in quarantine . Jasper : Clarke ! Thank you . [ Beeping ] 30 minutes . And we just changed it . That can 't be right . Uh , shh ... um ... It 's her last tank . Hey . Uh , we 'll find you another one . All the supplemental oxygen is on level 5 . Then we have to get you to level 5 . 5 isn 't safe for any of us . We 'll take the trash chute again . It will work . To get in , maybe . Maya 's right . Every solider in this mountain is there . We 'll never make it out . We can do this . We 'll split up . Octavia : Ok . You guys go for Dante . We 'll help Maya . [ Creak ] [ Horse neighs ] _ _ [ Horse neighs ] How could you do this ? I swore loyalty to this commander . She left our allies to be slaughtered . She dishonors us all . And your disobedience dishonors you . Why are you here , Indra ? Because you are also tree crew . I can 't just let her die . Under the terms of the truce , the lands surrounding the mountain are forbidden . If you violate this , Lexa will never take you back . Octavia made her choice . Now you make yours . [ Piano playing Chopin 's " Minute Waltz " ] - You ? - Thank you . Sir , Lieutenant Emerson is back . You 're needed in the dorm . Ok . Oh ! Oh ! Aah ! On their knees . Oh ! Oh , god ! Oh ! Oh ! Down . [ Woman sobbing ] We take any losses ? Not as many as they did , Sir . I 'm afraid I 'm the only one left who 's been cured . Some of the kids are still missing . If you 'd like , I 'll take a team in hazmats and sweep the other levels . No . No more wasted lives . In 48 hours , we will all be on the ground . Take off the the hoods . Woman : No . - Dad ? - Nate ! Uh ! Uh ! No ! You bastards ! What is wrong with you people ? Where 's my daughter ? She 's talking about Clarke . [ Drill whirring ] I 'm sorry it had to come to this . Man : Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! - He 's dead . - That 's ok . We 've already got all of the marrow . Guards , we need another one . She 's next . No . No . Take me . Don 't touch her ! - Don 't touch her ! - Get off . Don 't touch her ! Don 't touch her ! [ Woman screaming ] Woman : Please . No . Oh ! All right . Get a strap . Let 's go . Man : Please . Please don 't . - Huh ! - Yaagh ! Man : Hold her ! Hold her down ! No ! Get off me ! Woman : Oh ! Please don 't . Uh ... [ Whirring ] No ... No , no ... No ! Hello , Clarke . Sir , we need your help again . Monty : It 's ok . I took out the camera from the junction box in the hall . We can talk freely . No one 's watching , anyway . Thanks to you , they 're all on level 5 . - You 're not . - No . I 'm not . Bellamy : Please . We don 't have much time . We need a way to get our people out of this mountain without killing everyone . He 's not gonna help us . You cut the power , risking the lives of everyone in this mountain ... my people , even the ones who helped you . We knew they 'd be safe on level 5 . We made sure not to destroy the turbines so you could repair them . We 're the good guys here , not you . Tell me , if we released your people and theirs , what would 've happened to mine ? Can you get us into the command center ? We need to see what 's happening on level 5 . - No problem . - Let 's go . You 're gonna help us , whether you like it or not . That 's ... uh ... [ Panting ] Ah ! Ahh ! Ah ! [ Panting ] John , let me help you . I don 't want anything from you . Come on . You 're a survivor . We both are . Whatever you have to tell yourself feel better , Chancellor . Our destiny ... is out there , John . And what about Craig 's destiny ? We sacrificed a few to save the many . You know , you 're right . I am a survivor ... which is exactly why I am done following you . I 'll go my own way . You can go whichever the hell way you want . John . John ! Get the hell away from me . You lost too much blood . Be still ! [ Whirring ] Did you hear that ? Huh . Please , whoever you are , we need your help . Wait ! Wait ! John ... I can 't make it . Just go , all right ? We both know you want to . I 'll come back for you , John . Your promised land sucks ! I told you , there 's no one here . Sorry if we don 't take your word for it . Why aren 't you with your people on level 5 ? After what I 've done , they can be free . I can 't . Deliverance comes at a cost . I bear it so they don 't have to . It wasn 't Cage . It was your idea to make the deal with the Grounders . Monty : We 're in . Got it . It 's clear . He 's telling the truth . Ok . Let 's get the monitors up . Come on . We have to hurry . She 's out of air . First , you need to close the door . Uh ... [ Gasping ] - Time to spare . - Heh heh . She 's safe . Could we go now ? I 'll be ok . Look . I 'm not leaving you . - Jasper . - She 's alive , but she 's not safe . Cage knows I helped you guys . He 's on level 5 . So what do we do ? We kill Cage . I 'm in . I think main center 's live . Clarke : Oh , my god . Is that Raven ? Mom . Tell them to stop now . I won 't do that . Clarke : Emerson . Carl Emerson , Mount Weather security detail , come in . Who is this ? You know who it is . Give the radio to the president . Bellamy : They 're moving . Not a problem . I 'll bring it on main monitor . [ Taps button ] Cage : This is President Wallace . I have your father . If you don 't let my people go , I 'll kill him . How do I know you have him ? Stay the course , Cage . You won 't do it . You don 't know me very well . This ends now . Release my people . I can 't do that . It would mean the end of our people , Clarke . Bellamy : Clarke , we need him . And I need his son to believe me . Don 't make me do this . [ Piano playing " Minute Waltz " ] Dad ... I 'll take care of our people . None of us has a choice here , Clarke . I didn 't want this . Neither did I. Oh ! Uh ... [ Moaning continues ] [ Wheezing ] Listen to me very carefully . I will not stop until my people are free . If you don 't let them go ... I will irradiate level 5 . Clarke , on radio : Cage , listen to me . I don 't want anyone else to die . Stop the drilling , and we can talk . There must be a way to get us all out of this . - Emerson . - Sir . They 're watching us from the command center . Go kill them all . Yes , Sir . Emerson is coming for us . They deactivated my key card . Can you do that to his ? That one 's easy . Where 's he going ? The dorm . Monty , can you do it ? Can you irradiate the level ? I can do it . Wait a second , Clarke . We need to think about this . There are kids in there ... I know . And people who helped us . Then please give me a better idea . Take that one off the table . - Sir , we 're not done . - Now ! - Put her on it . - No . No . Please . Hey ! You don 't have to do this . Stop ! There has to be another way . - There isn 't . - No . What have I done ? Kane : No one has to die for bone marrow . We can donate it . We can donate it . Strap her down . Woman : Don 't hurt her ! No . Hey , we can donate it ! That 'll never happen . I can . I can make it happen with her help . We can all survive . We can 't . Proceed with the drilling . Steady . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Bellamy : Clarke , if we do this , there is no going back . Figure it out . [ Typing ] This is taking too long . I mean , what if she got caught ? We 'd have heard something . Then what if she couldn 't find Sergeant Lee or ... I don 't know ... the protocol changed ? What if he got caught ? Jasper , a warrior doesn 't worry about what he can 't control . Oh , thank god . Anyone see you ? Lee , put down the gun . You didn 't say there was an outsider with you . She 's not an outsider . - Yes , she is . - She 's with us . Cage is in the dorms . They brought another group in from the Ark , more marrow . They 're not even trying to fix the dam . How many soldiers with Cage ? Uh , 6 . Why ? Just get me close . They 'll be happy you found another 8 doses . I need a ... Aim for the throat . Slash . Don 't stab . Make it deep . I hope you know what you 're doing . Me , too . - You got this . - Yeah .

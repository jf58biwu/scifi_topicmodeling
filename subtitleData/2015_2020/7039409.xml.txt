 NARRATOR : Previously on Defiance ... AMANDA : When an Omec commander dies , his children eat his vital organs and gain his strength . NOLAN : So now his Unhinged , unstoppable daughter is at the head of 10,000 Omec . DOC : Under Kindzi 's command , the Omec will attempt to conquer this planet . It is time for our Dread Harvest to begin . ( CRYING ) ( SNARLING ) ( SNARLING INTENSIFIES ) Come on , Enchanters . Come and take a taste of Datak Tarr . ( SHOUTING ) None of these are Kindzi . She 's still out there somewhere . IRISA : With more on the way . ( GASPS ) ( MOANS ) My father is dead because of you . He 's dead because you murdered him . ( BABY CRYING ) What is that I hear ? Please . Please . ( GROANING ) No . ( BABY CRIES ) No . ( BABY CRYING ) ( BABY CRYING ) Ripped By mstoll Please . I beg you . Spare the child , and you may take my life in return . I do not require permission to kill you . Then take the most precious gift I have to offer . My free will . Spare this child , and I shall love you as my Enchanter . I will obey your commands , I will serve you , pleasure you . And when my usefulness to you has ended , my body will provide nourishment . Your offer is a good one . But I will still kill the child . No . No . You 've upset my wife ! ( SCREAMS ) How is she still alive ? We should leave . Go . Come on , go . Let 's go . DATAK : Get to the roller . STAHMA : Don 't make ... DATAK : Go . ( SCREAMING ) DATAK : Are you all right ? I am now . She killed Andina . And she would of killed us , too , if Mom hadn 't kept her talking . You saved Luke . I did no more than any mother would have done for her child . No more than Christie did . Don 't push your luck . You are healing well . Forget my injury . Why are the skies clear ? Why are there no new arrivals ? We had nothing to feed them . I thought it prudent we halt the protocol until we had time to discuss the matter as a group . ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) All-Mother . Look at what the Lowers of Earth have done to our family . There is but seven of us left . We must return to the ship . ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) How many more of us will end up on this funeral pyre ? I am the All-Mother and I will not be questioned . You need nourishment for the hunt ? Eat this . Omec cannot eat Omec . Are you refusing my order ? Of course not , All-Mother . You honor us with this gift . Let us grow our strength , so we can hunt for food in town . I will go reactivate the pods and bring down more of our family . NOLAN : Let 's start by focusing on the positive . Good news here is that by cutting off the Omec food supply , we 've forced them to go out and hunt . Yeah , but given that they 're hunting us , how is that good news ? Well , we 've slowed them down . He 's right . When the Omec are first revived from the pods , they 're weak . Eating makes them stronger . There 's no way Kindzi 's gonna bring down any more Omec unless she 's got something to feed ' em . Or someone . Okay , so we have a temporary advantage . How do we best exploit that ? We sneak onto their spaceship and blow them all to hell . That sounds promising . ( GUN COCKS ) Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Doctor Yewll is working with the Omec . Nolan ! Hey ! - Get out of my way ! - Stand down . Yewll 's back on our team . Yeah ? You sure about that ? Yes , I 'm sure . We 're all sure . Okay . Okay , that 's a good thing . ( EXHALES ) DOC : All right , kids . Gather around and pay attention . What we have here is the basic outline of an Omec harvester . The boarding party will be me , accompanied by three brave volunteers . We 're gonna hijack their ship-to-surface transit pods and arrive here , on the transit pad . How do you know so much about Omec ships ? It 's entirely possible I 've done this before . We 're gonna go here , to the control center . We 're going to unplug the Ark-Brain and wire me into the network . A man in the engine room is going to manually deactivate the fail-safe and shut the engine exhaust vents . This will allow me to overheat the engines and , ka-boom . Bye-bye , Omec . Are you sure this is gonna work ? No . Let 's say we 've succeeded . Say we 've disabled the engines . What next ? We run like hell and hope the descent pods still work . How are the descent pods still gonna work without a functioning Ark-Brain ? Let me worry about that . This is our ride home . I said I 've got it covered . This is our only shot . You can either trust me , or you can sit on your ass and let the Omec take the planet . What 's it gonna be ? Are you in or not ? - All right , then . I guess I 'm in . - Me , too . - And me . - No . That is out of the question . T 'evgin 's daughter caged me . She threatened my family and my home . I will settle the score . If the Mayor will have me . Ship full of Omec , a violent psychopath could come in handy . Be my pleasure to serve . ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) I married a fool . How long before we can leave ? I 'll need 20 minutes to prep . Okay . You do that . I 'm gonna go address the town . People of Defiance , the Omec are no longer allies . They have turned on us . Their plan is to feed . To grow strong on the flesh of our people . To take the town of Defiance and use it as a base , a launch pad from which to conquer the planet . Now , we cannot allow this to happen . If Defiance falls , the Omec will have grown too plentiful , too powerful for any force on Earth to stop them . We must hold the line . I let them into this town . Sold our souls to get through a long winter . And for that , I am deeply sorry . ( COOING ) Can you see ? What can you see ? He really does like looking up at the clouds . Yeah . You 're really good with him . You know , when this is finally over and we 're safe , you could spend some more time with him , if , you know ... If you want . I 'd like that . He really likes you . I like him , too . Good speech . Let 's hope it 's not my last . Next stop , outer space . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Back away , you purple shitheads ! ( GUN FIRING ) Filthy animal . ( SCREAMS ) Run ! Run , all of you ! Run ! Stay back , or this one dies . Let the kid go . Just put down your knife . Come on . Just do it . No . Amanda . No . No . Amanda ! Amanda . ( GASPING ) NOLAN : Move ! Move ! DOC : What the hell happened to her ? Omec . Okay . I need a heart monitor , a saline IV , and as many bandages as you can find . Now . All right , set her up for a plasma transfusion . Yes , Ma 'am . Lie still . - Doc , why ? - Listen very carefully . You 've got a hole in your abdomen . And if you keep moving , it 's gonna re-open and blood is gonna gush out of you like Christmas . So stay still . Why haven 't you left yet ? Because the Omec are hunting everyone in town , and I am up to my elbows in blood , missy . You almost died . Doc saved you . Saved all these people . Nobody 's life is important right now . Nothing 's important but getting on that ship and destroying it . I 'm sorry , Nolan , but that 's true . You have to leave . It 's just not a party without you . ( LAUGHS WEAKLY ) NOLAN : Wish me luck ? AMANDA : You don 't need luck . You 'll be back . You always come back . And when you do ... - Then we 'll talk . - Yeah . Amanda , I 'm a fugitive . No matter how this turns out , it 's only a matter of time before the V.C. show up looking to shove my head on a stake . They 're not gonna execute the man who saves them from an Omec invasion . - No ? - I 'll make sure of it . Well , that 's because they 're so reasonable , those people from South America . So logical . ( CHUCKLES ) ( SIGHS ) No matter what happens on that spaceship , this is my final ride . I know that , and I 'm okay with it . You 're so full of shit . Undeniably . And yet , throughout it all , you remain optimistic . I do . How is she ? She 's strong . All right , come on . Show 's over . Let 's get back on the streets . The Omec are still hunting . We don 't wanna give ' em any easy prey . Okay , no pressure . Alak , you 're with me . What do you say , Doc ? You ready to fly ? Well , there 's no point in putting it off . Where do you think you 're going ? Someone 's gotta take Amanda 's spot . Yeah , well , it 's not gonna be you . One rule . Man , she uses that like a club . ( CHUCKLES ) DATAK : No rollers , no purple . Luck is with us . Don 't get too cocky . A lot can happen between here and Old Saint Louis . DATAK : Old Saint Louis ? Is that where we 're headed ? Yeah . Access tunnel 's in there . Kindzi 's set up shop in an old subway depot . There 's a launching pad inside . It will take us up to the spaceship . ( WHIRRING ) Okay , I 'm online . We 're gonna go up one at a time . Who wants to go first ? I 'll run point . Like I had to ask . Okay , I hope that you had a light lunch . ( LOUD TRILLING ) ( LAUGHING ) NOLAN : No sign of any Omec so far . DATAK : They must still be in their sleeper pods . DOC : I 've got a hell of a wake-up call planned . Let 's go . What is it ? Earth from here , it 's beautiful . More beautiful than I ever imagined . Nolan , engine room is that way . We 're gonna head topside to the control center . I 'll see you soon , kiddo . Yeah . ( SIGHS ) They have kids up here . Evil comes in all shapes and sizes . IRISA : This is a child . DATAK : A child who would not hesitate to devour that grandson of mine you 're so fond of . How would that make you feel ? IRISA : You 're going in there ? I don 't have a choice . ( SCREAMS IN PAIN ) Was that supposed to happen ? Just shut up and put the cable in . Neck port first . It 'll let me talk to the ship . Are you sure about this ? Yes . ( SHUDDERING IN PAIN ) ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Unauthorized access . System purge . No , I belong here . System purge . No , I belong here . You can 't make me ... system purge . ( SIGHS ) Okay . What is that ? Doc Yewll 's orders . It 'll help you sleep . No . Pull it out . I don 't want to sleep . Shh ... You 've been through a lot . It 's all right to take a moment . Why are you here ? To change your bandage . Don 't do me any favors . You know you can 't work it off . Coming in here , playing Florence Nightingale , doesn 't make up for any of it . The town , the weapons we lost , the Arch , the deputy you murdered . You frustrate me . Do I , now ? I am uncomfortable with the reality that the person I most admire , the woman I respect more than any other , despises me . I give everyone a fair chance . You had your shot . You inspire those around you to be the best version of themselves . I saw it with Kenya , Doctor Yewll , Nolan . You have filled me with the desire to elevate myself in a similar fashion . I regret that I have fallen short . I regret that I can never be your friend . I don 't think it 's me you 're frustrated with . I suppose not . ( GROANS ) I 'm sorry . Don 't be . You 're not the one who carved my guts out . I 'm not apologizing for that . DOC : Nolan , can you hear me ? Yeah , Doc . Where are you ? I 'm in the communication network . I 'm tracking your movement . All right . Hey , can you tell me , am I going the right way ? Basically , the engine room is at the back of the ship . Three lefts , a right , and over the bridge . Once you 're there , I need you to close the vents . Doc ! ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Remove unknown body , corridor seven . Remove ! Remove ! Doc ! No . Doc ! I 'm under attack here ! Then ignore unknown . Does Nolan need help ? Yes ... Here , here , in sequence . Doc ! ( GASPS ) ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Remove unknown ! Remove ! Deactivate security drones . Systems acquiring target . Deactivate security drones , you stupid piece of shtak . Thanks , Doc . Owe you one . ( GROWLING ) ( BABY CRYING ) ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Spoiled meat . ( GUNS FIRING ) ( GROANING ) ( BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE ) ( BABY CRYING ) AMANDA : Hey , assholes . ( GRUNTING ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( OMEC GRUNTS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Okay , one more connection and I can control the engine . For at least as long as I can keep this up . ( GRUNTS ) You 're not coming back from this , are you ? That 's what you were hiding . For me , this was always a one-way trip . Why didn 't you tell us ? Because I 'm not a drama queen , like you . ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm so sorry . Don 't be . An artificial person is a tolerable loss . No . You 're a real person with enormous honor and infinite soul . Just stick it in me , sailor . ( CHUCKLES ) Make it count . Thank you for this , Meh . I 'm gonna miss you , pal . DOC : Nolan ? Yeah . I 'm fully uploaded into the Ark-Brain . I 've sent Irisa and Datak back to the pods . You need to follow them once you 've closed the vents . Walk over to the panel . Uh ... Oh ! Yeah , okay . Yeah , I got it . I 'm here . The instructions are on the screen . They 're in Omec . Please hold . Okay , if you see a big word , just sound it out . Yeah . I 'll do my best . ( CREAKING ) Oh , crap . - Hey , Nolan ? - Yeah ? Omec on your six . Hello , pet . I will not let you murder my people . And I won 't let you kill mine . NOLAN : What are you doing ? DOC : Don 't let her near the controls . Nolan , she 's trying to override me ... ( SLOWING DOWN ) ... to lock me down . ( GRUNTING ) Your father didn 't want this . He was weak . He lost his way . He saw where he was headed , he didn 't like it , and he tried to change . ( GRUNTS ) It 's something I struggle with every day . I have seen you fight . You 're a born predator . You are no better than me . When you 're right , you 're right . ( SHRIEKS ) Doc . Doc . How do I get the engines back on ? Doc ? ( SCREAMS ) DOC : I 'm back online . Everyone , get out of here . The ship goes critical in five minutes . - Come on , kiddo . - Kindzi ? Dead . Yewll ? She 's not coming . Neither am I. Aw , come on . This ship is full of intelligent people . I won 't let them die . This ship is about to explode . I have to stop it . The Omec are monsters . So were you , once . Me , too . We saved each other . We can save the Omec . Doc , is there any way to stop the explosion ? DOC : You got to be freaking kidding me . You can 't stop the explosion . All of that energy 's gotta go somewhere . Can we just vent it into space ? Yeah , but only through propulsion . And that would send us randomly slingshotting into deep space . We would be hopelessly lost . We 'd never find our way back to Earth . That 's kinda what I was going for , Doc . Find a home for the Omec , far from Earth . You coddle that kid of yours . You know that , right ? ( CHUCKLES ) Mmm-hmm . One last adventure ? Live or die together . ( GASPS ) Nolan , don 't do this . I 'm gonna miss you like crazy , baby girl . I am so proud of you . Now , you got one life . Use it well . Love you . I love you , too . DOC : We have three minutes to vent the engines . You might wanna hustle . There 's a plug in my head . Yank it out . ( GASPS ) Back ? Irisa just arrived safely on ground . Oh . Let 's roll . You don 't happen to know any Johnny Cash , do you ? You start singing , and I shoot you out the airlock . We 're going to Jackson . ( LAUGHING ) ( WHIMPERING ) Said you took a big trip They said you moved away Happened oh , so quietly They say IRISA : It 's been six weeks since my father left Earth . Should 've took a picture IRISA : Everyone says he saved the world . Something I could keep Buy a little frame Something cheap IRISA : They even named the new arch after him . For you IRISA : He 'd laugh his ass off about that if he were here . Everyone says hi Said you sailed a big ship Said you sailed away IRISA : Amanda thinks he 's dead . Didn 't know the right thing But she doesn 't know him like I do . To say IRISA : Ever since he was a boy , he dreamed of having adventures in outer space . I 'd love to get a letter IRISA : Right now , I bet he 's in some galactic cantina . Like to know what 's what IRISA : Getting into a fist fight because he hit on the wrong alien princess . Hope the weather 's good ( COMMUNICATOR BEEPING ) And it 's not too hot Lawkeeper . WOMAN : Trouble at NeedWant . I 'll be right there . For you Everyone says hi Everyone says hi IRISA : His other great wish , of course , was to be a good father . Wherever he is , I hope he knows that dream came true , too . Everyone says Don 't stay in a sad place Where they don 't care how you are Everyone says hi Everyone says hi Everyone says hi Everyone says hi Everyone says hi If the money is lousy You can always come home We can do all the good things We can do all the bad things Don 't stay in a sad place Where they don 't care how you are Everyone says hi Said you took a big trip Said you sailed away ( REVS ENGINE ) Ripped By mstoll

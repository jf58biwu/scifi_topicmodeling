AH , YES . THANK YOU , jBOT . Everything is delicious . IT IS MY PLEASURE TO SERVE YOU . So , what 's everyone got planned for their first day in the big city ? I got to run a thorough security check of the premises . That monkey-business crew calls itself a security team ? They wouldn 't pass muster at a boy scout jamboree . Well , you would know . Just try not to burn the place down while you 're at it , hmm ? How about you , boys ? Eh , I 'm gonna take it easy , enjoy the life of the idle , rich playboy . I 'm gonna visit the stuyvesant university campus uptown . Thinking of applying for the fall semester . [ Coughing ] NERD . jPHONE , SUBWAY DIRECTIONS TO STUYVESANT UNIVERSITY . [ J.J.

Pretty much the avengers are on our porch . Whoa . Good morning , citizen venture . Welcome to the neighborhood . Dr. Venture : ALL RIGHT . WHO ARE YOU , AND WHAT ARE YOU SELLING ? If it 's cookies , I 'll take two boxes of thin mints . If it 's religion , you can leave the way you came . [ Chuckles ] No , we represent the crusaders ' action league . And all we 're selling is peace of mind . [ Flatly ] ARE YOU TIRED OF FEELING AFRAID ? C.A.L. Is here to protect you and your property from all costumed menace , be it terrestrial , extraterrestrial , or supernatural in origin . C.A.L. Offers convenient monthly payments and a plan to fit any budget , so let 's go ahead and get you started with your gold plan today , okay ? And ... Why would I need the cast of " godspell " for protection ? Take a good , hard look over there , mortal . See that looming black phallus ? It 's turgid with the city 's nastiest super-villains , and it 's got a rape-on for super-scientists like you . I thought superheroes were just supposed to help people for free . Ha , yeah . Amateur superheroes . Yeah , well , this building 's already got professional protection - - mine . Ohh ... O.S.I. Way to do your homework , tosh . [ Monarch sighs ] Oh , hey . T-there 's coffee . [ Sighs ] Thank god . Where is doctor-my-wife ? Oh , she had to leave at dawn for some guild thing . SEÑOR GARY , LAS NUEVAS PUERTAS YA LLEGARON . DONDE LAS PONEMOS ? OH , UH ... DEJE LAS EN LA ENTRADA . UH , GRACIAS , MANOLO . Since when do you speak whatever that was ? Oh , long time . What ? I got rosetta stone . Why are you hiding that newspaper ? What , this ? Wait , wait , wait . I was gonna show it to you after you had your coffee ! I just didn 't want you to flip out . Why would I flip out over the cubs beating the mets ? I don 't even follow baseb- - oh , wait . You meant flip out because while I 'm stuck being the slumlord king of craphole county , my enemy 's basking in his ivory ... Tower ? ! Yeah . That . We 're going there . Today . No , dude , we are not set up for arching yet . Who 's talking about arching ? We shall merely reconnoiter ! That 's a weird word , huh ? Phantom Limb : THIS MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF 13 WILL NOW COME TO ORDER . Is everyone present ? All seven of us . Six . We only count as one . Hey , where 's the sovereign at ? I 'll call him . Killinger ! Killinger ! Killinger ! What on earth are you doing ? He 's not betelgeuse , you lunatic . Watch : HE 'S NOT YOUR NEW SOVEREIGN , EITHER . He left you this book . Said it contained everything you need to know to run the guild yourselves . Well , did he say anything else ? Don 't sit . Um ... The only other thing he said was [ German accent ] " MY WORK HERE IS DONE . " And then he just ... Disappeared . Well , who is to be our new sovereign , then ? You know , in its earliest iteration , the guild didn 't even have a sovereign . The council of 13 were all equals who ruled by committee . Preposterous ! Without a strong leader , the membership would revolt . Oh , they 're all about to revolt anyway . Our last " strong leader " left a huge mess after gargantua-2 . We got to put these people at ease . Indeed . The rumor mill runs rampant amongst the rank and file . I suggest we hold a town-hall meeting to address said rumors . - [ Grunts ] Seconded . - Agreed . But they must never know how close we came to losing this guild . For now , we need to assure them it 's business as usual . [ Breathing heavily ] [ APPLAUSE ] Brown Widow : NO , NO , PLEASE . It 's you who deserve the applause . You 've been a great audience , and I hope to see all of you when the semester starts . D-did I miss the tour ? The subways are really confusing .

Okay , well , while you think about it , how about i show you around ? I 'm something of a big man on campus around here , and - - [ chuckles ] Hey , lover boy ! Um , I think that guy 's trying to - - just ignore him . What , are you working for the weekend ? Here , maybe you could use a little pick-me-up ! Uh-oh ! My campus tour guide sense is telling me tosh tompkins is fixing to throw his energy drink at me . With my incredible spider-esque reflexes , I could easily dodge it . Or I could spin a web , pretty much any size , to catch it . But then the whole campus would learn my secret identity . Are you okay ? And that could put my poor old aunt - - [ grunts ] Oh . Mark knoepfler crapped his pants ! Again ! That guy goes here ? He 's like 40 . Yeah , he 's a teacher . I didn 't , you know , crap my pants . Yeah i-i know . I remember you now . [ Camera shutters clicking ] Tell me that 's the last of these . Nope . You still got St. Abernathy 's , the , ah , can-do club , and the friends of fox-fordyce disease . Ugh . It 's a wonder my brother had any money left . Can 't you do this ? No can do . Already late for me appointment at our queens facility .

Dr. Girlfriend : OKAY , THESE ARE VALID COMPLAINTS , PEOPLE , but we called this meeting to - - well , why don 't I just let the sovereign tell you himself ? Greetings , my loyal constituents . It is I , your sovereign , making a rare public appearance to assure you that the guild is as strong as ever . I call bullpoo ! That 's not the sovereign . The real sovereign went ape-o and tried to kill the council of 13 . I was there ! And so was she ! [ Sighs ] All right , the jig is up , Hamilton . Turn it off and come on out . [ Scoffs ] No way ! If phantom limb is the sovereign , I 'm moving to Canada . No , no , no . He 's not the sovereign . The sovereign ... The sovereign is dead . [ Crowd gasping , murmuring ] But the guild isn 't , people ! From now on , the council of 13 will lead us all . Oh , great . More anonymous heads in charge . And where are they ? Uh , you 're looking at ' em . [ Crowd murmuring ] Um , shouldn 't there be 13 of you ? Excellent question . Uh , we 'll be screening candidates to fill the empty seats very soon . Uh , will the council be more diverse , because , I , for one , would like to see more women in positions of authority . - And more people of color . - And more people of color ! Maybe ? Look , we don 't have all the answers right now , but we promise you this - - the guild will be great once more , and your council of 13 is here for you . [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Yawns ] What ?

Lovely way to talk about your constituents , Hamilton . He do got a point , though , madam monarch . There wasn 't anybody there above a level six . Well , that 's because no one from the New York chapter bothered to show up . New York has always been aloof , constantly threatening to secede . If New York secedes , we 're done for . We must reach out to their leadership personally , perhaps offer them a seat on the council . Exactly . If we can just land one big fish , the rest will swim along . I 'm glad you agree , because tonight , you 've got a date with their biggest fish of all . Go fish . - Hey , honey ? - Hey , pookums . Look - - we found an old deck of cards inside a wall .

That was the night he became ... Night dick . - [ Chuckles ] - What ? So , if I do this , the New York chapter will put its full support behind the new guild ? That 's the deal . Not much to ask . [ Sighs ] I-i don 't know . It 's just my husband - - is a mere level 6 , whereas I am a full 10 . I was gonna say " jealous " actually . Emotions have no place here .

Sergeant , these men are poaching on wide wale 's exclusive arching claim on Dr. venture without proper permission . This is an internal matter for the guild .

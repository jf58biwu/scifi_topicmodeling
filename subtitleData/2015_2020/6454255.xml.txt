 There she blows , then . Your brand-new synthetic . That 'll cover all your basic housework . This is the best thing you will do for your family . What about a doctor ? That 'd take me seven years . But by then , you 'll be able to turn any old synth into a brain surgeon in seven seconds . I 'm sorry about my case going over . Wow ! Mother of the year . The health service hasn 't ordered half a million of them for fun . I 'm happy with the one I 've got . These synths are physically no different to any others , and yet , Elster gave them consciousness . I don 't want one round the kids , Joe . We 're not taking it back . What if you can 't find her ? - No ! - I will find her , Maxie . Because I love her . You need to stay inside after we go to bed . Is that clear ? - Mummy ? - Hi . Morning , potato . Did you , uh ... Did you have an accident last night ? Ugh , Mummy , I haven 't done that in ages . I know . I know . It 's just you ... changed pyjamas , darling . The other ones are wet . I didn 't change them . OK . Never mind . Time to get up . I 'll go and do your lunchbox . Can you cut off the crusts , like Anita does ? Sure . Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . What could you accomplish if you had someone - something - like this ? These machines will bring us closer together . Put something on him , for pity 's sake ! Sorry , sir . - What is he ? - He 's the ' Mona Lisa ' . He 's penicillin . He 's the atom bomb . What have you found ? Yeah , well , this memory fragment 's an old one . It 's been reviewed internally thousands of times . Like it 's been remembered . Must be important . Stop it right there , Fiona , will you ? So , what happened ? He 's punched him a couple of times . Head butts . He gets him in ... I 'm gonna show you . Alright , come on . - He puts his arm behind his back , Agh . - And then he breaks it ... - Agh ! So they say , right , if you keep pushing , then the arm falls off . It hurts . That 's why . - You finished ? - Hmm ? Yeah ? Done ? Alright , Haystacks . Both gonna be late now . See you later . - See you later . - See you , Mum . Anita . Don 't suppose you could do my job for me too ? I 'm sorry , Joe . I 'm afraid I don 't understand the question . Never mind . Anita 's made us chicken chasseur for tonight . Oh . What you doing ? Just standing around being a shit mother . Oh , Maxie . Let 's go and see if Silas came back . - Hang on . I 'll give you a hand . - Oh , no , no . You sleep , love . No , it 's fine . Oh ! Mind your elbow . - Mind your elbow . - Yep . - That 's it . - Thank you . - Yeah ? - Yeah , yeah . - You 've got me , yeah . - OK . OK . - Tell me when you land . - Yeah . - Yeah ? - I 'm down . Busy day ? Oh , late shift . Not getting picked up till 1 : 00 . - You ? - Last hydrotherapy at 11 : 00 . I could take you , if you want . Wear me Speedos . What an offer . Nah , it 's OK . Simon will do it . You sure ? I don 't mind . He just knows what I need . Yeah . Oh ! Ohh . Oh . - Oh ! Bollocks ! - Christ ! You alright ? - Oh ! - Oh , God . I 'm stuck on the loo with me knickers round me ankles . You 're on the floor with concussion . It 's not even nine o 'clock yet ! There 's no bog roll left either . Simon ! Leo . What if we weren 't meant to be a family ? What are you talking about ? Maybe we 're not supposed to be together . No , there 's no such thing as fate . - Nothing 's decided . - Not for you , maybe . But we were made . Our father designed me to be a certain way . I can 't escape that . Everything that ever happened to me made me what I am now . I can 't escape it either . But he 's dead , Max . And when I look at you , I don 't see a design . I see my brother . Alright ? Come on ! - Jesus ! - Oh , sorry , Laura . I didn 't mean to startle you . Why do you creep around like that ? By default , I attempt to be as unobtrusive as possible , to promote a relaxing home environment . Is there anything I can do for you ? No ! No . I 'm working from home today . Why have you washed your shoes ? They became soiled from walking outside this morning , Laura . Did you ... Never mind . But I 'm watching you . I 'm watching you too , Laura . You 're right in front of me . Now , this guy 's a head cracker . A good one . If he realises what you are ... If I tell you to run , run . Promise me , Max . Whatever happens . Good . Alright . I 'm looking for Silas . I need a mod for this one . Salim Sadik sent me . Oi , boss . Friends of Sadik 's . How do you know Salim ? Do you remember when you and him got busted fencing those stolen EXULs ? What , like , three years ago ? I was the one that paid his bail . We used to junk . I owed him one . The mod can wait . I 'm actually looking for something for Salim . Don 't know why he wants it . Have you seen her ? What ? Oh , we remember that one . You worked on her ? He owes me money . Yeah , yeah . He mentioned that . - He mention it was 15 grand ? - No , he didn 't . It was just in passing . - This one would pay off a chunk . - No . Oh . Then maybe you can give Salim something from me . Something nice , I hope . Argh ! Stay back ! Tell me what you did with the synth and I 'm gone . Come on ! You 'll never see me again ! Some junkers brought her in a few weeks ago . They picked three strays up from somewhere . They powered her up to have a bit of fun . Turns out she was a corrupted mod . Gone in the head . Fighting , kicking . Weird . And what did you do ? Huh ? I sorted her out so they could sell her on . Gave her a new personality . Full system wipe . Good as new ! Ah ! You and me just fell out . Agh ! Ugh ! What the hell are you ? Run ! Ah , ya ... ! Ugh ! Argh ! Agh ! Agh ! Odi , hide . No . In the shed . Dr Millican . I said I 'd be back . I need to check on that D-series . Oh , I recycled him . Just as well I brought this one along , then , isn 't it ? Shall we get on with the forms ? Wait ! What are you doing ? The particulate saturation in this room exceeds safe limits for men over the age of 60 . - It must be cleaned and aired . - Maybe . But you don 't do anything without asking first . Is that clear ? I 'm here to take care of you , George . You 're here to do as you 're damn well told . - And it 's Dr Millican . - Yes , Dr Millican . There is mould on the skirting board . Mycotoxins in mould spores may cause your asthmatic bronchitis to reoccur . How do you know that ? The health service contract you have agreed to allows me to access your medical records . Agh ! Arghh ! Shooting pains . You must sit down . I will perform a full examination . Agh ! Try to relax . Ohh . Ooh ! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh . It 's better . It 's better . - You are prohibited ... - Get him inside . Quick ! Hurry ! Come on ! Turn it off . - I 'm trying . - Any unauthorised attempt ... Right . Good . - Oh , my God . Did he see us ? - OK , let 's connect it up . How do you know how to do this stuff anyway ? 'Cause I 'm a genius . And I 'm following instructions on a hacker forum . Here goes . Oh , hey , let 's make it punch itself in the face ! Crapness of your imagination makes me want to cry . If this works , we 'll be added as hidden secondary users . We 'll get to tell it what to do ? You 're ... You 're like this , um , sexy terrorist . Is that a joke ? - Yeah . Yeah . Obviously . - Moment of truth . If I 've done this wrong , I 've just broke 20 grand 's worth of school equipment . Illegal programming modification in progress . - Shit . It didn 't work . - School board has been notified . This really isn 't good . Go , go , go . - Come on ! - Come on , come on , come on . - Quick ! - Faster ! ... programming modification in progress . The school board has been notified . The school board has been notified . - Ow ! - Careful ! Don 't shout at him ! It has to hurt a bit . Peter , Jill said you may not be able to have dinner . I made you sandwiches to take to work . They 're by the door . Get in the car , sweetheart . Ready for another hard night at the coalface ? Domestic on the Warren Estate . Divorcing couple are having a public fistfight over who gets the family dolly . Peter . You forgot these . That 's not ... - What a beefcake ! - Just drive ! Peter ? Your sandwiches . Laura Hawkins . Mrs Hawkins , it 's Miss Evans here , Matilda 's head of year . - What 's she done ? - I think you should come in . What upsets me most is how brilliant your grades have always been . The careers advisor said she 'd make a brilliant research assistant or trainee sonographer . You didn 't tell me you 'd seen a careers advisor . It was just a dolly . Do you have a problem with synthetics ? Why would I have a problem with the thing that 's making my existence pointless ? I told you , I didn 't touch him . We both know there 's no-one in this school who would even know where to begin . Modifying synthetics is not only illegal , it 's also dangerous . If I find you were responsible , exclusion will be on the table . Alright . I 've heard your allegation and your threat . But I haven 't heard any proof . My daughter has said she didn 't do it , so until you come up with some evidence to the contrary , that 's how we 'll proceed . Mattie ? I have double English down there . Meet me in town at 4 : 30 . We 're going shopping . That 's a creative punishment . Yeah . Well , I might even buy you some shoes . I 'm not pissing about . Expulsion ? Christ . That 'll totally cock up my career prospects . Got you ! Look . I 've got , like , zero future . There 's literally nothing I can do that a dolly can 't do better , and I 'm cool with that . But you , I dunno . You can still ... do something . - You need to be more careful . - Next time , I 'll crack it . It 's all so pointless . The synths could hit a hole in one every time and all they do is carry the bags - it 's like ... I don 't know , using a Ferrari as ... a golf cart . You know why I like smoking weed with you ? I feel it thicks you down a bit , you know . Well , not to my level , obviously , but ... a bit closer . I should go . You 're actually going to meet her ? Wish Mum could just be honest with me , you know ? Instead of treating me like a problem she has to solve . My problem 's simpler than that . My dad hates me . One bowl of low-sodium bean broth . You need to run a self-diagnostic , old girl . I said a toasted cheese . This meal is in keeping with your current dietary requirements . Yes , I 'd like ... I 'd like to return my synth . What is the nature of the fault , sir ? Well , there 's no fault . It 's just that she 'd be better suited guarding a chain gang on a Siberian gulag . Unless there is a fault , sir , there are no grounds for replacing or returning your assigned care unit . Could you say that again ? I had a stroke . And I forget things , and ... I 'm a widower , and ... Unless there 's a fault , sir , there are no grounds for replacing or returning your assigned care unit . Christ . You are . You 're one of them . Yes , sir - if you 'd like to speak to a human manager , our next available ... Seriously , what are we doing here ? I 'm assuming you did it . - Yeah . - Why ? To see if I could . Just ... don 't do anything to Anita . The others think the sun shines out of her plastic arse . What do you make of her ? Do you think she 's normal ? Not ' she ' - it . I 'll tell you what isn 't normal about it . I remember you saying we 'd never get one . It 'd mess with our heads , make us lazy , blah-blah-blah . Then suddenly , Dad goes out and gets one and you 're OK with it . Oh . Mattie , come on . Whatever . Is it me or are we here every other day ? The synths steal their jobs , they steal the synths . Makes sense to me . DI Voss . How many appliances ? OK . Come on . Silas Capek 's back in business . Can 't believe they let him out . Yeah . Over there ... OK , switch her on . Hello , shithead . Is it really that nice in prison ? I assume you 've got documentation for these units ? They 're not mine . I found ' em . I suppose none of them have been illegally modified for purposes that contravene the Synthetic Registration Act ? Who knows ? But I 've seen some proper freaky ones recently . It 's a funny old game , innit ? - Oi ! - Pete ! Pete , stop ! - Help ! Help ! - Uh ... Get them to the station , will you ? Report that , you 'll do twice as long . Hey . You want out ? Apply for a transfer . - What 's the matter with you ? - We 're losing ourselves , K. These - they 're turning everything to shit . - No-one else can see it . - Oh , really ? Because all the bad things that ever happened to me were done by other people , and this is a bit rich coming from the man who owns one . I don 't own it ! The insurance company sent it after Jill 's accident . Stays a few weeks , gets her back on her feet . OK . Come on . I 'll drive you home . Leo ! Leo ! Wake up . We have to get our family back , Maxie . Niska 's waiting for us . Let 's take care of you first . Number 7 , disinfect . Number 7 . Next in six minutes . There 's literally no end ! What we 'll do - why don 't you do this and we 'll take a break ? We 've gotta get the other wheel back on . Yeah , that 's what I 'm saying . You do that ... I 'm not doing that . This is your bike ! Dad , you need the exercise , mate . When was the last time you put that wheel on ? You heard him , Maxie . They did something to her head . I know . Save your energy . They 've found us . You need to get us out of here now . - What about our stuff ? - Max . - You need to ... - Max ! We need to go . Ladies and gentlemen , in just a few moments , our show will begin . Um ... Oh , let me ... do it . - It 's fine . - Of course , Toby . What is a chasseur anyway ? It 's a guy who drives you around and then stops to rub your shoulders . That was quick . Yeah , I thought of it earlier . What 's she doing ? - Anita , what are you doing ? - I 'm doing the ironing , Laura . What 's that ? What are you ... Oh , God ! Argh ! Oh , God ! Tegenaria domestica . The house spider . I found it on the wall as I was preparing to iron . - Did you know ? - I 'm sorry , Laura . I don 't understand the question . Did you know I don 't like spiders ? Did you do that on purpose ? - How could she possibly know ? - I 'm sorry , Laura . I won 't forget that you don 't like spiders in the future . Shall I finish the ironing ? Yes , please . - Laur , what 's going on ? - Oh , I don 't trust it , OK ? You brought it into the house and we don 't know anything about it . It 's a machine . She 's watching me . OK , now ... you just sound ... What the hell is going on with you ? Please stick out your tongue . You 're kidding . Any non-compliance or variation in your medication intake must be reported to your GP . You 're not a carer . You 're a jailer . Elster would be sick to his stomach if he 'd seen what you 've become . I 'm fine , OK ? Now get lost . Tugboat . That 's good . Store that . That 's your new name . Any new designation or diminutive not on the pre-approved list must be cleared with your local health authority in their capacity as this unit 's primary user . You should sleep now , Dr Millican . Your pulse is slightly elevated . Slightly ? Your GP will be notified of any refusal to follow recommendations made in your best interests . There are bits of you that have hardly changed since my original designs . I ... I helped create you . Perhaps I could perform a soothing action - stroke your head or play some relaxing forest sounds . Um , maybe the land of Nod is calling . Goodnight , Vera . Do you think we love our children because we choose to or because we have to ? Are we hard-wired to love them because that 's what nature needs to keep it all going ? Blimey ! Where 's that coming from ? I 've just been thinking . Not everyone loves their kids . I think we choose . You know , whatever 's going on with you , it 's got nothing to do with Anita . Stop trying to make it about her . She doesn 't give you the creeps ? Did something happen in Leeds ? Excuse me , Laura . You left your mobile phone downstairs . God ! Ow ! Ow ! Oh , what are you doing , you ninny ? You 're supposed to be hiding . If someone sees you out here ... The bulb is reaching the end of its useful life . Aren 't we all ? Now , listen . Put yourself into energy-saving mode . Not yet . First of all , sit down . Now , put this cloth over your head . - Is it a game , George ? - Yeah , it 's a kind of game , Odi . Dr Millican ! Energy-saving mode now . What are you doing , Dr Millican ? Oh ! Minding my own business . This is an improper environment at this hour . - You 've injured your knee . - It 's alright . I must ask you to return to the house . I don 't take orders from you . What are you ... How dare you ? You can 't touch me . I didn 't give you permission ! This isn 't right . Oh , shit ... - Hello , Toby . - Shit ! Are you having trouble sleeping ? Just ... just be quiet , please . I just needed water . Sorry . I thought you were , like , hibernating or ... I put myself in an energy-saving mode during charging . Are you sure there 's nothing I can do for you ? No . Thanks . You just shut your eyes again , yeah ? Just pretend I 'm not here . Inappropriate physical contact between myself and secondary users must be reported to a primary user . Are you gonna tell my parents ? My safety and well being will be massively at risk if you do . I cannot withhold information from my primary user , Toby . Ohh ... Ohh ... - However ... - God ! In this instance , no inappropriate physical contact was made , so no information is deemed . There 's nothing to tell your parents . Thanks . I 'm really ... really sorry , Anita . Why 'd they have to make you so fit ? 7 . You 're up . Hi , handsome . I 've been waiting for you all ... Please . There 's , um , no need to bother with all that malarkey . It 's not the Ritz , is it ? I don 't really know what I was expecting . What would you like me to do ? Well , we could start by sitting down . I 've , um ... I 've never done anything like this before , as you probably tell . My God , you 're beautiful . Do they , uh ... do they ever let you out of this room ? I can initiate sexual contact if you would prefer , but you must confirm . Alright . I suppose . Yes . - Perhaps you 'd like to talk ? - No ! No . What I 'd like ... - It 's not , um ... - It 's alright . You can tell me . I want you to act scared , like I 'm ... you know ? And I want ... I want you to be young too . Yeah . No . No ? What do you mean , no ? No , I won 't do that . You 'll do whatever I tell you to ! I paid £ 100 up front ! For the next hour , you belong to me . I don 't belong to anyone . Who taught you to talk like that ? My father . - Hey , sexy ! - Come here ! Bloody hell ! Don 't you move . Who 's been mucking about in your head , then , eh ? Everything your men do to us , they want to do to you . Argh ! Seriously - seriously , I 'm docking your allowance if you can 't go quicker than that . - Come on ! Which way are we going ? Hello . Why don 't you share ? We 're not having much luck pinning down any other memories . They 're all just stored chaotically . The others will go to ground when they realise we have him , so we need to work fast . Perhaps it 's time we try something else . Like what ? Talking to him . Leo ? Le ... Come on . Hello in there ! Are you ... Are you done in there ? Hello ! Public toilets . Could you hurry up , please ? There we go . - I 'm struggling , Dad . - Don 't drag me back . - Don 't drag me back ! - Yes ! - Cheating ! - Get off ! - I 'm an old man ! I 'm an old man ! - Oh , yes ... - Ohh ! - Oh , yes ! Oh , don 't show off . Ah ! Ha-ha-ha ! Good morning , Laura . - Did you sleep well ? - Where 's Joe ? He and Toby left for a bike ride 23 minutes ago . Would you like something ? Juice ? Coffee ? Morning . You were right about it . It 's not normal . How do you mean ? When synths meet each other , they share data wirelessly , updating each other on useful stuff . You know when you see them staring at each other all weird and silent ? Well , Anita doesn 't do that . Why don 't you share data with other synths ? I 'm sorry , Laura . I 'm afraid I don 't understand the question . Did you take Sophie outside the night before last ? Her pyjamas were wet . They 'd been changed . No , Laura . Are you lying to me ? I cannot lie . How can you be so sure ? I 'm programmed not to lie . I cannot contravene my programming . - But ... - Therefore , I cannot lie . You can go wrong . You can break . Yes , Laura , but I can detect no current system faults . So you don 't know anything about Sophie being outside ? Did you hear what I said ? There was water . What do you mean , " There was water " ? It rained that night . Perhaps Sophie went outside . I know she went outside . That 's what I 'm saying ! I will always keep Sophie safe . What 's that supposed to mean ? Would you like me to finish clearing up now , Laura ? Oh , come on , come on , come on . Hello ? Hello . Is there someone I could speak to ? About the behaviour of my synth . Um , I recently acquired ... Mummy ! Is it possible for them to have accidents ? Mum ! Sophie ? Are you alright ? There 's a wolf under my bed . I think you had a nightmare . That 's all . Don 't be frightened . Cuddle ! I 'm sorry , Sophie , I 'm not allowed to touch you without your mummy or daddy saying it 's alright first . Cuddle ! It was eating me . For as long as I am with you no harm will ever come to you . Anita ! Mats , have you seen Anita ? Anita , get away from her ! Go and get in the car , right now . - Where are you going ? - I 'm sorry , Sophie . Anita has to go away . Say goodbye , please . - No ! Why ? - She 's broken . No , she isn 't ! She 's my friend ! Soph , please , darling . Say goodbye . Sophie . If your mummy says I 'm broken , then I must be . Your mummy wouldn 't lie . And if I 'm broken , I can 't look after you properly , can I ? Goodbye . 'Bye , Mattie . I 'll look after her . - Thanks . - Hey . Shh , shh , shh . It 's OK . It 's OK . You 've still got the most bad-ass big sister in the world . - Would you like me to drive ? - No ! May I ask where you 're taking me ? Back .

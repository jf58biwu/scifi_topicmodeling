A sub-lieutenant . How long have you worked there ? About four years . What made you choose the field job ? I believe I can do it . Are you here for yourself or did they send you ? Both reasons . Here 's what you need to know . First , after a month of training , you might or might not be chosen . Second , if you should become chosen , your assigned mission will be highly dangerous . It involves international terrorism . Failure could mean death . You still have a chance to change your mind . If not , I 'll tell you one last thing . Tell me one last thing . Your code name is " Gunja . " Can I have another one ? There 's one rule you must remember . No negotiation . Nice to meet you . Good luck . This way please . The test facility is ready . Go ! Go !

Peace be upon you . - Peace be upon you . - And upon you be peace . - Peace be upon you . - And upon you be peace . - Peace be upon you . - And upon you be peace . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I just don 't like his face . How 's your uncle doing ? He 's gotten better . The bullet just grazed his leg . What about the thing I asked you ? Getting information on Zaifuddin . Don 't worry . Our people in America have agreed to help . Just relax . You 'll get the information in two months . Got to give them some time to find the best who can be trusted . So how did your uncle know he works for the ClA ? Actually , he didn 't know . He just didn 't like his face . So he just said this guy could work for the ClA . What he said made me think of the possibility . And I became suspicious . I need to know the truth . Sorry for being late . Amil Al-zuri . You two-faced rat ! Zaifuddin ! He betrayed us ! Zaifuddin ! You lying bastard ! Every life belongs to Allah . No one has the right to destroy what belongs to Allah . Who gave you the right ? You don 't know . You should live up to your given name . What are you trying to say ? Why did you get involved with these people ? We have been mistreated ! Those bastards deserve it . Lieutenant ! Lieutenant ! - We 've got a problem . - What is it ? Emergency meeting about a hostage situation . This way , please . Hurry up , damn it ! Is it ready yet ? In a minute . Hurry up ! Lieutenant . Everything 's taken care of . Boss , your call . Yes . Yes , sir . I 'll do as you say , sir . Here you go . Thanks . Forget the trip to the beach . We got a job . No detail yet . Boss told me to get Mazaru immediately . Why does it have to be today ? [ Speaking indistinctly ] I have an important job for you . Get your men ready . Major , Miss Claire is here . Oh . So Miss Claire has gone ? She 's gone . Captain , get in touch with the National Intelligence Agency . This man is called " Wajib . " We believe he is in Bangkok . Give them this picture . Major , what if they want more information ? Tell them to call me directly . Yes , sir . Don 't worry . I have enough men to support you . Thank you . Call me Mazaru . They found Wajib . Tomorrow is the D-Day . There will be no more Wajib on the face of the Earth . I 'm sorry . Hello . Hello . What can I do for you ? Oh , we are here to see a friend of ours . His name is Wajib . Oh , Mr. Wajib ? Two foreign friends of yours are here to see you . Who are they ? Tell them to wait there . I 'll come down . Just a moment please . Okay . Oh , hey ! Wait a minute ! Hey ! Wait ! Shit ! He 's gone ! We got tricked . They 're aware of the leak . We 've got to do it now . Don 't miss it . Checkmate . - There you go . - Just what I thought . You got me there . Shit ! He got shot ! Call for backup ! The suspect is in black . The suspect is in black ! Nothing , sir . Sergeant , stay here to help them . Yes , sir . It means they 've got it . I regret not being able to protect him . In the world of spies , Major , anything can happen at any time . Saif . So ... You got it ? Call me when you need my service . There 's an army of mosquitoes in here . Shouldn 't we raise the windows up ? How could you guys stand it ? Aren 't you getting bitten ? Mazaru ? Gotcha ! Stop it already . You 're bugging me . It 's just like Okinawa , your hometown . Mosquitoes everywhere . Why are you complaining ? Annoying . Look. is that Wajib ? It 's him indeed . Wajib ! Get yourselves ready . Who are you ? Why did you get into my apartment ? Where 's Wajib ? Who ? I don 't know him . Don 't be surprised why I know you . I must applaud you for being able to get the intel to kill Zaifuddin . Now ... Your luck has run out . It 's not that easy , you infidel . You know what this is , don 't you ? It 's the remote control for the bombs you 've planted . You know what happens if I smash this up ? What are you saying ? Calm down , Major . This is to create a situation . After Bangkok is bombed , my group will be blamed . The world will be lied to that this is connected to international terrorism , justifying the order to send troops into this region . Just like what happened to Iraq and Afghanistan . You , too ! You are just a pawn in her game ! Your story is intriguing , Kasim . But it 's all bullshit . What you said was actually your plot . Don 't waste time trying to negotiate . Your time is up . Tear gas ! Mazaru ? What have you been doing ? It 's going badly in here . Help us out . This one is alive ! Call the captain ! Hey , move him over there . Yes , sir . Listen to me . You blew it , didn 't you , Mazaru ? Hana told me Shigenori is dead . You can 't fail again . Do you understand ? I understand , Boss . Take the major out . - Don 't let anyone see you . - Yes , Ma 'am . Mazaru ! If you have a chance to kill her , don 't hesitate . Otherwise , you might become her kill . Hana , come with me . I 'm going to Wajib 's house . Claire . Oh , Sirin . You 're just in time . Come on . Claire ! You think you can just walk away ? The major is still alive , Claire . Then I 'm in trouble . I thought you came here to help me . So what ? Are you going to shoot me ? I don 't shoot anybody from behind . Then you 'd better stay out of this . If not , you can 't say I didn 't warn you . Hey ! What are you all doing here ? Auntie , she 's got a gun ! Hello , Hana . Where is it ? Okay . I got it . I 'll be right there . I must tell Claire . Claire just ordered you to kill me , didn 't she ? Go tell Claire , if you want me dead , come and get me . I 've never known you . You don 't have to . Mazaru ! Why don 't you fight ? This is your last fight . Fight me with the spirit of a samurai ! Boss , get away ! Mazaru ! You killed the boss ! You must die ! Make sure the major is safe at the hospital . Don 't worry , Captain . Our men are guarding him around the clock . Get our men ready . Wait for my order . Yes , Ma 'am . Black Tiger Unit . The target is on the move . I 'm on them . You 're a tough one , huh , Sirin ? Kill them . You think you can kill me that easily ? I think you 're injured , Lieutenant . How do you know me ? I just know . Why did you follow me here ? I followed Claire , not you , Lieutenant . What 's the hurry ? I thought I 'd never get a chance . Gunja , let me tell you something . You will not last to see tomorrow 's sunrise . And it 's not my fault . You walk into your own death . Hell seems to not welcome me . When you betrayed us two years ago , I made it out alive . You should know that , Claire . But this time , hell can 't deny my request . I must say sorry to you in advance , Gunja . I 'm standing at the scene of a huge explosion that happened earlier . Officials from several units are collaborating to clear the scene . The fire is now under control . It cannot be determined yet whether this is connected to terrorism . But a number of suspects that survived the blast , believed to be the perpetrators , have been rounded up . Do I have to get a shot ? Is it necessary ? You need to get one , Ma 'am . From the look of your wound , it 's starting to get infected . Antibiotic shot ? Yes , Ma 'am . But you need another shot . What is it for ? Tetanus shot . How 's your wound ? Getting infected . But I 'll survive . I heard you need some shots . Two of them . Thank you , Captain . For ? If not for you , things might not turn out this way . Just a coincidence . But Claire was not an ordinary woman , that 's for sure . Okay , get well soon , Lieutenant . There 's another thing . Sorry about hitting you . Don 't be , ' cause I 'm sure I 'll get you back soon . Okay , I owe you then . Another thing . How did you know I 'm a police officer ? I 'm sorry , but you need to lie down so I can give you an IV . I 'm waiting for the answer . Let 's just say I 've known it a long time ago . Get well soon .

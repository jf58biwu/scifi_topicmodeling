 Five ! One , two , three , four , five . Fuel . Well ? Mmmm ... What to do , what to do ? Free fuel - get refill for free , and throw again . Let 's see . How come you keep getting great cards ? It 's a mystery , isn 't it ? I 've never been beaten at Mineopoly , Lister . Undefeated since birth . In the Space Scouts , my game play was so legendary , they called me Minotaur . Is that cause you were half a man who was full of bull ? Because I was like the mythological beast that no one could pass . Well , you better not throw a 2 and a 1 then , Rimmer . Throw a 2 and a 1 and land on my space station , and your bank is ' rupted , baby . Lister , I 'm not gonna throw a 2 and a 1 . The odds of that are ... eighteen to one . It 's not happening . I win , you can 't complain about anything I do for entire week . I remember the deal . I win , I can move my lips when I read . I can leave peetra ( ? ) on the floor so that you step in it . I can even snore like an inebriated warthog and you can 't throw frozen onion bhajis at me . The good times are gonna roll ! Lister , there 's only gonna be one winner here , And that 's votres truly . And when I do , as agreed , you are going to wear an evening gown , day and night , until you can play James Last 's Polka Party on the bagpipes . Here we go ! Anything but a 2 and a 1 . A 2 and a 1 . Come to Daddy ! No willing it . I 'm willing it . I 'm allowed to will it . I 'm willing it . Stop willing it ! You 're good at willing it . No willing it ! Come on ... Out ! Doesn 't count ! Doesn 't count ! One of the dice came off the table ! Re-throw required . That doesn 't count . I used my hands , an illegal move . Naughty me ! Re-throw required . 5,382 to 1 . No chance . You couldn 't make this up ! Wait . You throw . Swap chairs ! Throw . Do you now accept that you threw a 2 and a 1 and you lost this game ? ! Okay ! I accept it ! Just lucky for you , I 'm such a good loser ! Hey , This green blinky thing , we 've any idea what it is yet ? It 's an escape pod , Sir . And it seems to be emitting an unclassified energy field that 's causing minute disruptions to everything in the local vicinity . Pretty much as I figured , then ! Talk in English , would ya ! ? I 'm not fluent in gibberish ! This is the S.S. Samsara Escape Pod , Ident 12 / Beta Two . Can you read me , over ? Y-yes , we copy , Ident 12 / Beta two . This is very important , you must ... .. What happened ? ! ? We lose the link ? ! ? No matter , Sir . I 'll remote control the pod into the cargo bay . Who eats ice cream in bed ? It 's just utterly .. Uh-uh . Uh-uh . No complaining . And no complaining about not being able to complain about not complaining . An entire week , without being moaned at by you . It doesn 't get better than this ! Do you know what the difference is between you and me ? I can 't store hand luggage in me nostrils . I am cursed . I remember the day it happened . I was nine years old and this busker claimed he was an alien and wanted to sell me some lucky space dust . Even at nine , I was no fool . I knew he was real . But all I had was my hover fare to get me home from baton twirling practice . And as I walked off , he cursed me for life and I 've never had any luck since . It was just some homeless bloke , Rimmer , trying to make a buck . You cant take things like that seriously . Smeg happens . You just roll with it . I 've been rolling in smeg my whole damned life , Lister . Don 't lecture me about smeg-rolling . I never get the breaks . Oh here we go , " Whereas you ... " Whereas you ... " lead a charmed life . " lead a charmed life ! Well it 's true - you do ! I 'm alone in deep space with you ! How charmed is that ? ! The crew got wiped out , you survived - that 's charmed . I survived to live the rest of my life with you - not charmed ! I 'm dead ! How unlucky is that ? ! ? You 're dead but you 're still talking to me ! How unlucky is that ? ! ? Bing bong ! Sorry , Sirs . The bing bong machine is being serviced this evening . I 'm afraid we 're on manual . Sorry to disturb , but we 've salvaged an escape pod with two survivors . One Colonel Jim Green , and one Professor Rachel Barker . We 're just about to open the booth and take them to the science room for debriefing . Message ends . Bing bong ! Acting Senior Commanding Officer Arnold J. Rimmer , an absolute pleasure to meet you . Uh , Sir . Uh . Colonel Green , and Professor Barker . They 're dead ! Hey , their medical reports aren 't in yet . We shouldn 't jump to conclusions ! We spoke to Barker then the link went down . When we opened the pod , we discovered this . What happened ? ! ? Well , they appear to have been vaporized , Sir . Quite how and why , we 're not sure . What do we know about them ? Well , the log tells us that Green was the ship 's human exploration and mission director . Barker was a computer scientist . They were both married , but not to each other . Surprising ! They look like they 'd be the perfect match ! What became of the ship the escape pod escaped from ? The S.S. Samsara . Have we any idea what happened to that ? Well , judging from the pod 's flight recorder , and the fact that there is no wreckage , we believe the ship must have crashed on this ocean moon . It seems to me we should do two things : One - scatter the ashes . And two - find this ship . On to two , then . Find this ship ! So , what are we hoping to find here ? Faster than light drive , quantum computer - but to be honest , I 'd settle for a bubble gum dispenser . I wonder what happened to Barker and Green . Wrist please . Thank you . Sirs ? Professor Barker reporting for duty . Welcome to the Samsara , Professor . This is my colleague , Colonel Green . Anka . We were both stationed on Caicos 12 , Sir . Ah , Caicos 12 , of course , yes . We discovered my wife attended the same college as your husband . I must get on . I 'll catch up with you later , Jim . Now remind me , You were a computer scientist specializing in ... What was it again ? I 've missed you much ! I thought you 'd never get the transfer . Nor me . Let 's go to my quarters . Look at this dust . I love dust . After fluff , it 's my all-time favorite dirt ! We 've any idea what caused this crate to crash ? Nothing yet , Sir . It 's a state-of-the-art research ship , with self-repairing engine parts ! Crashing should have been out of the question . What 's this ? ! Well , you can see why they crashed . Tell me about it . How can you fly a space ship , and at the exact same time , all play Twister ? ! I don 't think it was Twister they were playing . Not properly , that 's for sure . Twister is a three-player game . Everyone here 's just waded right in ! Hey ! Wait your turn , buddy ! What 's the rush ? This is worst and fresh as we got in art school . How did they die like this ? It doesn 't make sense . According to the phys scan , they were flash-heated to death ! An instant blast of extreme temperature killing them instantly , but preserving their body positions . Spooky ! Agreed , Sir ! A cold chill has just run straight down my spine . Eh , that was me - just spilled some lager down your back . Who turned that on ? The mainframe probably detected us . Check this ! According to his dog tag , this man was the captain . Tom Cadry . Indecipherable gibberish . What kind of writing is that ? Gelf ? Looks like Welsh after about 15 pints . Strange , that dialect is not on my data base . Maybe it is Welsh after about 15 pints . I wonder ... Sir , would you mind sitting down ? What , me ? Dictation on . Permission to strangle you , Sir . What ? ! Granted ! So maybe the captain was strangled , by this person here , who 's been stabbed ! Perhaps the next hub will offer a clue ! Thanks for that , Kryten . Very well explained ! Jim , I 'm so sorry I 'm late ! That 's all right . It 's only been an hour . I think I must have eaten some bad fish last night . I 've been feeling really ill . Shall we go to your place ? What happened to your back ? Argh - herniated disc . I 've been having the worst luck recently . Nothing of interest here . Let 's try the next one . Look at this ! A one-armed bandit ! How cool is this ? ! ? I need a coin ! I 'm an orphan , ain 't I ? Why can 't I take money from the orphan fund ? Are you really going to take it ? Who 's gonna know ? Only you . And your conscience . Forrreeeevvvveeerrrr ! Just relax , would ya ? Ooh ! What was that ? What was what ? Something just dripped on my head from the ceiling . Where ? Up there , I think . What the hell is happening ? ! ? ! Get me outta this thing ! I 'll get something to cut it ! Don 't move ! Like I 'm gonna move ! Sorry ! I saved you , Bud ! Whatever you do , don 't move ! I gotta knife in my foot ! You think I can move ? ! I 'm just going to ease it out . Ease it out , right ? ! ? Nice and easy . And you 're not just saying that to make me relax 'cause you think the best thing to do is to jerk that sucker outta there with one big-assed yank ! ? Aaaargh ! I had no choice ! It was the only way to get it out ! I think I 've gone blind ! It-it must be something to do with my foot ! I got foot-in-eye disease ! Cat , relax man . It 's just a power cut . What a relief ! For a second there I thought I 'd never see myself again ! Plus having to choose an outfit every day that matches your guide dog ! Don 't even go there ! The door 's locking ! Sir , the doors are double-sealed . We 'll never get through ! So what do we do ? ! Suggest we head for the next chamber , and see if there 's an access port back to the main hub . Where 's your torch ? I left it in the other chamber ! I left mine , too . I can 't see a thing ! Give my eyes a minute to adjust . Oh , wow ! What ? They 're readjusting ? What 'd you see ? That it 's really dark ? Can 't you see that ? Of course I can see that , you smeghead ! Well you can see in the dark , right ? With your super-seey cat 's eyes , right ? ! And you can swing from trees , right ? With your super-swinging monkey arms , right ? ! We evolved ! So did we ! Who 'd evolve so that they can 't see in the dark ! ? Who 'd evolve so they can 't swing from trees ? ! You 'd never be late for anything ! Kryten ! Rimmer ! Help ! I suppose we 've just gotta sit tight . I 'm gonna fix my foot . I 'll get the first aid kit . You sit down . Can 't see a thing ! What the hell was that ? ! ? Ship 's slipping into the mush . W-we 're gonna die , I just know it ! How come you 're so damned chill ? ! ? We 've gotta stay cool , haven 't we ? We don 't want the ship sliding any more . We 'll sit tight here , fix your foot , wait for the others to find us , and then we get out of town . You 're right . Stay calm . We 've got food , water , everything we need ! You and me , we can survive in here for days , weeks , months even ! Just the two of us ! Kryten ! Sir ! Are you okay ? I think so . What is that ? ! I believe it 's a Karma Drive , Sir . A what ? It 's based on the old Justice World tech , where the pain an individual inflicts on another is redirected back on them . With one important difference - the Karma Drive has two modes . A punishment setting , and a reward setting . What 's the point of that ? They were designed for long-haul space missions . They were intended to promote teamwork , reward kindness , understanding , and ethical behavior . So , how does it work , exactly ? Well it creates a Karma field that analyzes behavior , and then manipulates reality to reward or punish . So when you behave ethically , the ship rewards you . How ? Your coffee is fresh , your shower is warm , your food is tasty . Well that doesn 't make sense . Morality changes across time and cultures . Once slavery was an accepted way of life . Now it 's considered repugnant . Who decides what 's immoral and moral ? Well , it 's programmable , Sir . And that 's what made the Karma Drive such a dangerous piece of kit . Anyone can implement the moral code of their choice , and then force others to live by it . I wonder if that 's what happened to me on Red Dwarf when I lost at Mineopoly . Did Red Dwarf enter the Karma Drive 's field ? Was the drive manipulating the dice somehow ? I don 't understand , Sir . I threw a 2 and a 1 seven times in a row . What are the odds of that ? 62 million to 1 , Sir . About the same as being killed by a tangerine . Why punish me ? I wasn 't doing anything wrong ! Kryten , this Karma Drive is too unpredictable . We 've gotta get out of here pronto . Sir , there is no cause for alarm . We 're under no danger as long as we don 't do anything vindictive , selfish , or unethical . Kryten , we 're in big trouble . Sir , you just have to be nice to me . Big , big trouble . The Karma Drive report has just come down from central ops , and it doesn 't make for pleasant reading . You both have committed a whole range of misdemeanors . There 's a Karma Drive on board ? Last week alone : Extra-marital sex 18 times ? Extra-marital fondling 67 times ! Extra-marital licking whipped cream off ... We get the picture ! It goes on ! You , Rachel , have lied this week to your husband and others 93 times ? ! That 's just not true ! 94 times ! You 've been unkind 20 times , criticized others 40 times , and not said " thank you " twice ? ! Captain , We 're in love . When you signed up for this tour of duty , you agreed to abide by the moral code selected for this ship . So we 're all supposed to live the Mega Core dream , where the married stay married , and sons call their fathers , " Sir ! " and everyone eats lots of homemade apple pie ! You got it - so start squirting your whip cream on apple pie , and not on one another 's body parts ! Hey ! Good job on the foot , Bud ! Even managed to save the boot ! We 've gotta think of a way to get out of here . Nah , just give me like 10 minutes . I 'll bet I come up with a plan . I get great ideas all the time . I just don 't say ' em out loud ! You say everything you think out loud . I 'm like that inventor guy - b-begins with " R " . Rosenthal ? Sidney Rosenthal ? Who ? Invented the magic marker . Magic marker ? ! The guy I 'm talking about is real ! He ain 't no wizard out of a book with his magic pen ! Inventor guy . Begins with an " R " ... I-I-I got it ! I got it ! The inventor guy I 'm like ! Begins with " R " ! Who ? Archimedes ! Archimedes . Archimedes ! The guy that sat under trees and invented stuff ! That was Newton . You never heard this story ? So , one day Archimedes is sitting under a tree . The all of a sudden out of nowhere , this bath hits him on the head POW ! And he gets up , shouts " formica " , and invents gravy ! It was Newton who was sat under the tree . And he discovered gravity when he got hit on the head by an apple . An apple can 't concuss ya ! That ain 't gonna make you stagger around , shout " formica " and invent gravy ! Formica is a heat-resistant , wipe clean , plastic laminate . Who 'd shout " formica " ? It doesn 't make any sense . No one shouts " formica " ! You get hit on the head with a bath , everyone shouts " formica " ! Look , Archimedes discovered something to do with water displacement when he was sat in the bath , and he shouted " eureka ! " So , Mr. Ellen Einstein , Answer me this : Who invented gravy ? No one ? Did it just magically appear one day like your stupid wizard pen ? ! Gotta have some pain killers . Okay , listen . Answer me this : How does a bath fall out of a tree ? A plane , dummy ! Taking off ! They probably forgot to shut the back door ! And the bath slid all the way from first class . WHOOSH ! Through the curtains , into business - WHOOSH ! Through the curtains , into premium - WHOOSH ! Through the curtains , and straight into the poor people section . Who incidentally , probably still haven 't even had a bag of peanuts , while the dudes in first have already eaten , watched a movie , and are all now having a bath ! Meanwhile Arcie 's sitting under his tree . CLANG ! Invents gravy . And because everyone 's so damned happy because everybody loves gravy , right ? They gave him a special hat to wear at night to cover up the bruising ! Special hat ? They gave him a knighthood . A " knight " " hood " . Not a special hat to wear at night to cover up the bruising ! Man , I try to teach you stuff ... I don 't know why I bother ! What 's that saying ? ! You can lead a hearse to water , but you can 't make it sink ! K-Kryten ! Help ! 720 meters , Sir . The ship 's nearly at crush depth . The Karma Drive is controlling everything on board . We have to be kind to one another to stand any chance to save Mr. Lister and Mr. Cat ! An excellent suggestion , Kryten . That 's very insightful of you to make such a helpful recommendation , and I thank you greatly . Static ! I was complimenting you ! Why did it punish me ? Perhaps it wasn 't genuine , Sir . I 've got to be genuinely nice ? Oh , this is impossible ! Oh dear . What ? I think I know what killed the crew , Sir . The ship 's quantum motherboards are power loading to flash-heat the ship ! We 're going to get flash heated ? ! How long have we got ? ! I 'm not sure , Sir . Ugh . Why am I asking you ? Someone with a head shaped like something produced in a geriatrics pottery class ? The power loading has stopped , Sir ! The temperature 's cooling ? Why ? Of course ! That 's it ! Man , she was the greatest soldier in history ! Led her people to victory ! Julie Caesar . Kryten ! Thank God ! Thank God ! No one should have to suffer like this ! He 's right ! If I wasn 't there for him to talk to he 'd probably have gone crazy ! Kryten , man ! It 's so good to see ya ! Sir ! Stop ! Stop what ? ! You stand there with your 1970s cover band haircut , and I say to you : Don 't be nice to me ! We know what happened to Barker , And Green ! What happened to you ? Your hair 's insane ! I went to the ship 's salon for a makeover look what the robo-stylist did to me . Yeah - similar thing happened to me at the dentist . Every chance it gets , the Karma Drive is punishing us . The showers are freezing , the air con is icy , I had to wait 2 hours yesterday ... . Have you tasted the food ? Jim ! I can 't take this anymore ! We 've got no choice . Yes we do . I am a computer scientist , for God 's sake ! If I can access the KD 's mainframe , then perhaps I can reverse the protocol . Give us some respite . Even if it is only for one night . Reverse ? So it rewards the unethical and punishes the good ? Just one night . Then , we 'll stop seeing each other , 'til we get back home . Barker and Green reversed the protocols , and as a consequence , good behavior was punished and immoral behavior was rewarded ! Kryten just figured it out . Saved all our necks . Kryten , if you weren 't so ugly , I could kiss you . Well , you could shake my hand , Sir . Still too ugly . You see ? Unkindness rewarded . This is all beginning to make sense . I mean , think back . I mean the Cat , nicked the money out of orphans ' fund , to play the one armed bandit , And I won the jackpot ! You were rewarded for stealing . And I put the winnings back into the orphans ' can , and got me locks caught in the shredder ! You were punished for being benevolent . I saved him , and got a knife in my foot ! I fixed his foot , And he got to spend quality time with me ! Moving swiftly on ... Who reversed the protocols and why ? Well , best guess - Green and Barker were having an affair and wanted to spend time together . How sad is that ? I mean basically their love for one another brought down the entire ship . One thing I don 't understand , Well , actually there are about 40 things I don 't understand . How come Green and Barker weren 't flash-heated with the rest of the crew ? While the rest of the crew survived by acting immorally , Green and Barker realized they could escape , so long as that escape was unethical . So they took the ship 's only escape pod and fled ! And then they went into cryo-sleep for millions of years . Where they were safe ! But when they tried to warn us about the Karma field , an act of kindness ... The Karma Drive had them vaporized . So where does that leave us ? It leaves us getting the hell out of here really carefully ! We just have to remember to avoid being honest , moral , kind , selfless , and helpful . That 's not fair . You 've got such an advantage ! Hey , what 's that ? Fuel Tax , miss three goes . Hey ! How come you got so many Mineopoly cards in your pocket ? !

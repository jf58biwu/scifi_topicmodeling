 Oyi ! Oyi ! Police ! Police ! I am fine ! Hello Stranger . What do you want ? Just want to talk . I thought you 'd said everything you needed to when you put a gun to my head . Come on . You 've never done bad things ? Not like that . No , you gamble on your daughter 's life . Risked her drowning . What a nice man you are . That 's done , it 's in the past . And what I 've done , to the man who murdered my children , that is done too . Oh , so you 're a sweet girl now , hey ? Just the odd murder here and there , when you fancy it ? How can you be so small ? You have something that makes you different from everyone else on the planet . Everyone except me . There was a moment when I thought you were everything . When I thought we could be perfect . We can be . Then I saw you kill a man without hesitation . Exit the passionate lover . Enter the boring policeman . So , what are you going you do with me ? What can I do ? It 's over . Is it ? The guilty will be punished Harry . What do you mean ? Isabella , what are you going to do ? S02E07 Second Chance Original air date April 7th 2017 Morning all . So ... what brings me to Soho ? One dead body . Belonging to ... Dean Adams . Forty-seven , property developer . Is this place his ? No . It belongs to a Sam Browning . We 're having a little trouble tracking him down . There 's a hair underneath the fingernail . He didn 't put up much of a struggle , but it 's something . A hair ? Long , black . A woman 's , I 'd say . Not much of a romantic spot is it . Drug deal ? Ah ! Easier places to score than here . He doesn 't look like a user , but the tox report will tell us something . So he comes up here , alone with a woman ... She just lures him up here for sex , but it 's a trap , it gets messy ... No , there 'd be more of a struggle . And he wasn 't robbed . So what else you got Mister ? The Green Dragon Casino . Well . Well . Well . _ Lily-Anne Lau . Long time . Harry Clayton . Business or pleasure ? Business it is then . Did you know Dean Adams ? No . Who is he ? He turned up dead in Soho , with one of your chips in his pocket . He never visited your casino ? If he did , I wasn 't aware . We have so many clients . Don 't we , Harry ? So none of your employees would say you talked to him , maybe gave him the VIP treatment ? Ask them . Is it just gonna be the two of you questioning me ? It 's just ... I have other friends here who I 'd love to catch up with . Sir . What ? Isn 't this nice ? Just like old times . Still dragging her down with you ? But if we were to find people who said that you did know - Mr. Adams ... - You won 't . Or found evidence , physical evidence that placed you at the crime scene ... Like a strand of your hair . Well , then , everything that you 've said today , recorded here on tape , that would start to unwind , wouldn 't it ? Would look bad for you in court . Physical evidence ? - Really ? - Mm-Mm . Harry . Ooh . Something 's up . Interview suspended , twelve thirty-two . You need to let her go . What ? We don 't have it . The hair , the evidence , it 's been lost between here and the crime scene . Lost ? What ? Ho , how ? I don 't know , but right now we have nothing else to hold her . How does a piece of evidence go missing ? My whole line of questioning - is based on that bloody hair ... - I know ! Look she 's laughing at us , Harry . Get rid of her . Then come and find me . Is this the bit where you let me go and apologise for wasting my time ? This officer will escort you back to the custody suite where you 'll be asked to sign a release form . Very good . Don 't be a stranger , Harry . Harry . Just Harry . Are you sure it 's Lily-Anne ? Well , it 's gonna be hard to make it stick now the hair 's gone . But , she did it alright . I know her . Evidence doesn 't simply 'go missing ' . The only way it could have disappeared is if she got - someone to get rid of it . - Someone ? Someone who ? You heard what she said in that interview . She 's got ' friends ' here . In this department . I think one of our officers is bent . We carry on as normal . You continue to investigate the murder , I 'll dig around here . Who do you trust ? Without question ? Suri . So brief her . No-one else . Okay . Sorry to interrupt . Sir , we just got the police records for Sam Browning . The guy who owns the building where we found the body . Twenty-seven years old , multiple arrests for prostitution , various drug and alcohol related offences . Not your , not your typical homeowner ? Apparently left the property by one of his sugar daddies . Thanks . Where were you last night ? Err , I was in Soho as it goes . Doing ? Just out with a mate , nothing special . And you can get this mate to corroborate , you know ? Yeah . Yeah of course . Why ? Sir ? I 'm asking everyone , Steve . Just a bit of procedure . Okay . - Thanks . - No problem . Go find Sam Browning , Harry . So , what did she say , exactly ? Something about punishing the guilty . You just let her walk away . What else was I supposed to do ? Arrest her ? For what ? So now , she 's ... Yeah . She 's out there , somewhere . What about Daisy or Anna ? She won 't hurt them . Not after what happened to her own daughters . I hope so ! So it 's me . In her eye 's I 'm the guilty one ! Yeah ? Yeah , hello . It 's Steve Orwell . I was here last night . Can you buzz me up ? Yeah . What happened ? What happened ? Where did , where did they go ? Alan and Tom . There 's no one here . Yeah , I see that . Where , where have they gone ? This place been empty for three months . No , no no . I , I , came here last night . To see , Alan Philips and Tom Lynch . Right here . Ed , I want you to bring anything your SOCOs turn up straight to me . No one else . Yes , Detective Superintendent . What else ? We 've collected some fiber samples by the door , we don 't know if they belong to the murderer yet . It 's not easy with this mess ... I can see . - Try anyway . - Sir . And the murder weapon ? It was found wrapped in a police glove . Dumped for later retrieval , I 'd imagine . Looks like it 's been wiped clean . Maybe we 'll find something at the lab . The number you have dialed is not in service . Police . You out . You two go . Not you . - Sam Browning ! - How d 'you find me ? This is the fifth place I 've looked and I am getting angry ! - Why are you hiding Sam ? - What do you want ? Is this something to do with Lily-Anne Lau , huh ? - No ! No , I 'm just ... I 'm detoxing . - Like bollocks you are . I 've got a dead body in a property that you own . - I didn 't do it , I swear . - Then who did ? Why do you think I 'm stuck in this shit hole ? Was it Lily-Anne Lau ? Right . Well let 's go and talk to her . She 's not a cop . Huh ! No , don 't , she 'll kill me ! Oh , she 's a pussy-cat . She cut his throat ! I was there ! I saw it ! Why ? 'Cos she wanted the property , of course . It 's yours , not his . Yeah but he was gonna buy it , wasn 't he ? And ? About three months ago , Lily-Anne started getting all chummy . I didn 't get it , but I didn 't ask why either , so now I 'm in her casino , chucking chips around , she 's like - have fun , don 't worry - before I know it , I 'm like fifty grand down . And she wants it back . So she says , give me the property and I 'll wipe the slate clean . For fifty grand ? Bollocks ! That place is worth - Loads more . Yeah . And she , she scares me , man . So I just thought - get rid of it , get her off my case . And I meet this guy Dean . At her Casino . He did something in property , say 's he 'll buy the place off me for two and a half . Million . Lily-Anne didn 't like that . So she killed him to stop him buying your place . And to make me sign it over to her . She made me do it right then , with him gasping and spluttering on the floor . He was dying , lying there , looking at me and she just shoved a pen in my hand and ... I 'm the only bloody witness , aren 't I ? I signed it and then , when she was checking it , I pegged it . Dead man walking , that 's me . Not with me , you 're not . You don 't understand ... It 's alright . You 'll be safe with me at the station . I hate you . My best friend . Do you remember how we used to be ? Sharing everything . Sisters almost . You loved me so much you gave me the most incredible gift . You kissed me on the cheek and then you ... sealed it around my wrist . And now I have nothing . Since you took Harry from me . You had to make sure I had nothing didn 't you ? We are in the bowels of my building . If you 're lucky , the caretaker might find you in time . Or he might hear you struggling to break free . Or he might be out all day . It 's all down to luck . You live by it . You die by it . The shooter fired - thirty rounds , the kid didn 't stand a chance . How are you still standing ... - You want to go home ? - No . No . Any news on the missing hair ? I checked a list of officers who visited the evidence room yesterday . I think that 's where the hair was stolen . Steve Orwell 's name was there . That doesn 't mean he did it ! There 's no reason for him to go there . Come on , he was demoted for this sort of thing . And he has a history with Lily-Anne , she was his informant . Now it looks like she 's turned him . Well , let 's talk to him . He 's disappeared . No explanation . Hasn 't answered his phone . Vanished . - Anna . - Hi . Now that 's a surprise . I had a blazing row with Harry . Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that . Well he told me to stay away from you . So here I am . Oh , you might need a drink ? I just poured myself one . Oh . What a beautiful place . Thank you . Hum ! Must have taken you ages to get it just right . How long have you been here ? Cheers . How 's Jonny ? Oh , he 's fine . So ... ? How long ? Oh well ... a few months , I suppose . Straight after Guatemala then . I 've got this friend . He works in Border Control . And I was asking him about you . - Really ? - Hum ! Anyway he did some digging for me . And erm , well here 's you fresh from the flight , and there , on your wrist is that bracelet ! The one you said was a present from Harry . Harry says it gives him luck . And it curses him too . Are you gonna say the same ? Yes . My daughter believes in it too , that bracelet . But then she 's thirteen . So I was , just wondering whether you might like to tell me , what is really going on ? Cos you seem perfect ! Perfect ? ! Gosh . My daughters would have been around Daisy 's age . Course they 're perfectly dead . Perfect . Perfect . What is perfect , Anna ? Harry still tries to think that his life , can be perfectly normal . Bless him . Still clings on to that hope . Five bullets . Five chambers . Now you can tell yourself that this is a magician 's trick . And you can ignore everything that your delectable husband has been trying to tell you . And you can tell yourself that I am perfectly mad , - a gambler , just like him . - Please don 't . But Anna . Dear Anna . Never , ever , ever call me perfect . If this bracelet won 't let me go , I don 't see why you should get away so easily . I haven 't forgiven you but you 're my only witness . I 'm gonna drag you with me , this life you gave me ... Make me a promise . Promise me , when I die , you 'll destroy this bracelet . Don 't hurt someone else the way you 've hurt me . Yes ? Yes . Harry thinks it 's finished . He 'll see . He 'll see . I wasn 't sure if you 'd come . I didn 't do it . I wouldn 't have told you I was here if I had . I couldn 't look you in the eye . That 's exactly what you 'd say if you had . Oh Jesus ! Why 'd you bring me here then ? Well I knew if I called , you 'd be less likely to answer . I 'm being set up . I swear when I said I was in Soho ? I was . The only reason I didn 't say more was because , because I was there for a job interview . So I go to see these guys , okay ? They 're talking about this big security firm they have . They know all about me . I go back the next day to corroborate my story , and they 've disappeared . So you have no alibi for the night of the murder . Then I noticed my key card has been stolen . I mean , you have that , you swipe that . I 'm ... anywhere you want me to be . I see that that 's missing , I hear that Lily-Anne is involved - and I know I 'm being framed . And yeah I know , I shouldn 't have run , I know how that looks . But Winter will arrest me on the spot . He 's got no choice . Harry . I know what I 've done to you and I ... I 'm sorry . Maybe they should have put me away , not just demoted me . But I 've tried to make amends . I 've been trying all year . I 'm not bent ! I didn 't do this ! Okay . So where do we start ? Let 's get a list of all the officers who were at the murder scene . See if they 've any links to Lily-Anne , oh and find out who else was in the evidence room that day . I 'm on it . So why are you trusting Steve ? After everything he 's done to you . Well . Maybe everyone deserves a second chance . No matter what they 've done . Let 's just keep out of Winter 's way , right ? Where have you been ? Trying to find out who killed Sam Browning . Bullshit . Where 's Orwell ? Don 't lie to me , Harry . I just wanna know who the mole is in our department . Where was Orwell when the first murder happened ? And where was Orwell when Sam got shot ? Because he wasn 't here . I was there , Alistair . Sir . You call me Sir , and you answer my bloody question ! He didn 't do it . You know I could have you arrested . And Suri . For obstructing this investigation . - Oh Jesus ! - I trusted you ! I told no one else . You are the one person in this whole department and you spit this back in my face . You 're chasing the wrong man . Where . Is . Orwell ? - Why don 't you trust me now ? - You went behind my back ! This is what Lily-Anne Lau has done . Don 't you see that ? She 's put someone in amongst us and now we 're all fighting against each other . It isn 't Orwell . So stop wasting my time . Don 't you dare ... Harry ! You get back in here right now ! Sorry about him . But I 'm not in a very good mood today . I knew you couldn 't keep away . Is this about the tables , the cards , or me ? Oh , this is all about you . You see I know what happened . How you coerced Sam into signing over the property ... killed a man in front of him to scare the wits out of him . I 'm talking to you ! Get my car . I 'm bored . See the thing is , I don 't remember any coercion . Sorry . Oh , come on , Harry , you 're not really here about that silly boy , are you ? I was there , when he died . I heard . You 'd already got what you wanted . You didn 't have to kill him . Okay . On the plus side , I am going to turn Sam 's place into a bar . You should come along , Harry . Have a complimentary drink and think about how you can never , ever beat me . It doesn 't matter if you don 't bet anymore , Harry . The house never loses . I 've got a list of everyone who was at the crime scene and the evidence room , like you asked . Don 't go up . Winter 's gone mad . He 's interviewing everyone , one by one . Right . Thanks . I can 't believe one of our guys would steal evidence . I just don 't believe a cop would do that . Neither can I. This list isn 't complete . Yes it is . Every detective who worked at the crime scene and the evidence room . Hum , every detective . What about the SOCOS ? Hello , Inspector . Oh , bloody hell , Ed ! How many times have I told you to call me Harry ? Sorry . I 'm a bit old-fashioned . Harry . What brings you down here ? Have you heard about Steve Orwell ? I 'd heard a rumour ... is it true ? He seemed like such a nice fella . They always do . The one thing I can 't work out is how he was able to hide the murder weapon . He would have needed to be one of the first officers on site . Otherwise it would have been photographed and logged , - right ? - Yeah , that 's right . My guess is that Orwell must have slipped the knife away when no one was looking . Easily done . You know we 're all so busy , no one 's really watching what anyone else is doing . Am I right ? I suppose so , yeah . Then he realises that he can 't hide Lily-Anne 's hair because it 's already been spotted . So , he waits until it gets in here into the evidence room , pops in and steals it . The only mistake he made though was , he used his own key card . It has him logged as entering here at err ... Got it . Eleven-forty-seven . Eleven-forty-seven . That 's odd . I was sure he was with me ... but if it says it here , it must be right . So when did you get in ? Huh ? I mean , you must have been in here all the time , as the Scene of Crime Manager . Yeah . I was . Of course . But you 're not logged in . Anywhere . At all . He says he wasn 't here . His key card says he was . You say you were , but your key card says not . Now that 's a funny thing , isn 't it ? You 're a clever man , Ed . I 'm sure you don 't have Orwell 's key card on you anymore . And the CCTV in the corridors might not categorically prove that you were the only person who could have stolen the evidence . But , I know . We both know . Don 't we ? Harry . I 'm so sorry . I 've never gambled . Not once . I 'm a simple person , you know ? Do things , do them properly . But my daughter is not the same . She says I 'm so dull . Maybe I 'm the reason she started . I don 't know . Either way , she bet and she lost . She bet and lost again and again until she was in real trouble . And that 's when they turned up on my door , with her next to them , begging and sobbing . Just a few favours . Nothing big . Just show them some paperwork , tell them things every now and then . I thought that would be it . But of course it wasn 't . Once I 'd started , they had me good and proper . I 'm so ashamed . I should have told you , but I was scared for her , of what they would do . They told you to lose evidence of Lily-Anne 's hair ? And then take Orwell 's key card and use it to frame him . I just saw Orwell 's jacket on the chair and ... Oh God . Having betrayed this department ... will you testify to this in court ? Yes . But I don 't think it will be enough . She 'll deny it . And I can 't prove anything I 've said . Not unless you get her to say it on tape . Do you think McCarthy 's strong enough for this ? He wants to make amends as best he can , so I think it 's a good plan , Sir . Okay . Harry . I got it wrong . About Orwell . Well you , you made a call based on what you knew . But so did you . You helped him . You worked together without me . To stop me . You should have explained yourself . Helped me see your thinking . Trusted me . Go on , go get her . Right . Let 's get going . Ok , Ed . We 're all set . Right . Yeah . In you go . We 're listening . Any sign of trouble , we 'll be there in seconds . Yes . Yes , you said yeah . I 'm err , here to see Miss Lau . It 's err , Ed McCarthy . Thank you . Ed . What a surprise . Yes . I wanted to tell you it was all done . Well , whatever that is , you had a number to call . There was no need to come see me in person . We 're finished now , right ? My debts are paid ? For my daughter . I did what you asked . All of it . Come on , Ed , say it . Spell it out , say it , come on . I 'm not sure I know what you 're talking about . My daughter 's debts . And the things you 've made me do . Me ? Really ? Yes . You . You told me to steal and destroy evidence ... I think you have a fever and it 's making you delirious . See I 'm curious as to why you 're here . I spy with my little eye ... Please . Please ... You have to understand . I had no choice ! Do you hear me ? Please ! Please ! Please ! - Car . Now ! - Don 't let them hurt me . Lily-Anne . Ed McCarthy . The SOCO guy . I don 't know what he 's told the police , but it 's the last thing he 'll ever say . Kill him ! Yes ? Lily-Anne Lau , I 'm arresting you for conspiracy to murder . You know , you really should be careful whose phone you 're using when you arrange a murder . Let 's go ! Did the swap work ? Yeah . Worked a charm . - Feel good ? - Yeah . You wouldn 't get that feeling working at a security firm . Probably get a shed-load more holiday , though . We need you here . I need you . Forget the transfer and the other jobs . Stay . Please ? Okay . I 'm not sure about this . A room full of cops ? Like you 've got a better offer ? There 's gonna be loads of arm wrestling and tit jokes , isn 't there ? Yeah , that 's just the women . Come on , it 'll be fun . And what about ... you know , your women ? I haven 't heard a thing . You know , I keep waiting , expecting I 'm gonna turn round and there she is . With an axe ? Or a machine gun or ... Maybe she 's just gone . Yeah . Finally realised you 're not worth mooning about ? Good girl . Yeah . Hello , pretty boy , couple of Bushmills . Wow . You 're celebrating ? Too right . Hi Steve ... To success ! Right .

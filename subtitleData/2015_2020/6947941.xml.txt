And he is a junkie now . Who the fuck are you ? You know ? You got some buck shot on your door . I heard you was in Phoenix . But then last night some friends of mine at Texas HP Told me they found 3 dead cholos in the pool out on 54 . Not unusual , I know . Except one was missing a hand another one a leg . So they was thinking ... It was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Kruger . But neither one of them can drive ... One being fictional and the other one extinct . And since the wheel lugs they found belong to a 24 Chrysler ... Well ... This is a 24 Chrysler . She found you yet ? Gabriella ? You see ... I 'm not looking for you , Wolvie . Well , not really , I 'm looking for someone who 's looking for you . She took me something of mine when I wasn 't looking . Something for which I am responsible .

He has got all these details . I thought that tank was supposed to act as a barrier . - It has gotten cracks in it . - Please stop . Bottom left . You 're not listening . He 's been asking questions again . That why we 're here . I think he 's trying to read my mind . That 's what these are for . Friends , I have good news for you today ! It 's not about what you do . It 's not about your deed . You gotta give up to God . He knows what you can 't . It 's Okay , we are imperfect . Make way , sir . I said make way ! The new " quesalupa " from Taco Bell !

They don 't want me , they want you . Oh yeah ... That 's how fucking stupid they are . They 're waiting for you at the Statue Of Liberty . Statue of Liberty was a long time ago , Charles . A long time . There are no new mutants . You understand ? There hasn 't been a new one born in 25 years . Not anywhere . We always thought ... We were part of God 's plan . Maybe ... May be we were God 's mistake . What a disappointment you are When I found you ... You were persuing your career as a cage fighter . A life of an assassin hooked on barbiturates . You were an animal . But we took you in . I gave you a family . They are gone now . Logan . What did you do ? What did you do ? Answer me ! Why are we here ? No one should live like this . Drugged in a fucking tank ! - It 's for your own good . - No no , it 's not ! You 're waiting for me to die . I don 't want to fight ... but there 's things we need to discuss . What things ? Would it be considered nagging ? If I was to repeat my previous observation that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures It 's what the guy gave me . He was not in a position to make demands . Well , I was dying this morning . - That seizure ... - It was barely a minute . It felt a lot longer than a minute . I could not breathe . You are less affected . You know he needs a higher dose . And I know you got more money squirreled away . Money to get us out of here . No , not us . You and him . You 're saving to buy a sun seeker . Sun is the key word . I hardly see myself cowering below deck it 's like Nosferatu Do you ? Folding your underpants , And making him spotted dick Found this in your pocket . Adamantium . If you 're planning to blow your brains out ... Could you wait till we 're out on the high seas ? - I just mopped these floors . - I don 't need this shit . A year ago , you asked me to help you . God knows I 've tried . But I can 't help you , Logan , not really ... if you are not gonna talk to me . I hear you at night . You are not sleeping You don 't wanna talk about that . Or the booze you 're drinking . Or the pus you are wiping away from your knuckles . Or the blood I wash in your clothes Or the fresh wounds in your chest . The ones that aren 't healing . And I 'm pretty sure .. You don 't want to talk about the fact that you can 't read the label on that bottle . It says ibuprofen . That was my favorite mug Stay out of my shit .

You know who she is , Logan . No , I don 't Does she remind you of anybody ? I 've read about you when I was a kid . I believe you 're thinking of someone else , Now If I 'm not mistaken , you used to work for my team . You were helping round up all those old mutants . What changed ? You got a religion ? I 'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys ... and track one more special mutant for me . I 'm not helping you . Of course you would say that . But I 've got a theory that people don 't really change . Beware of the light . Caliban , I bet that 's what your mama told you everyday when you was a kid . Beware of the light . Let 's not bring out the worst in it , shall we ? The girl is not worth it , trust me . She is not a natural fuck up , like you . She 's a business mistake , RD going bad There 's liability . They can 't have things with patents running around hurting people , can they ? We need to get her off the board before she hurts anybody else . Someone you care about . So get to sniffing . My name is Gabriella Lopez . I 'm a nurse . And for 10 years I worked for Transigen research in Mexico City . Transigen is owned by an American company . What I 'm about to show you is illegal ... in the US and Canada . They told us we were part of a pharmaceutical study . But Of course , that was a lie . These children were born in Transigen . They were born here ... and have never left . They have never seen the sun or the ocean ... rain or snow ... or any of God 's creatures . They have no birth certificates ... No names ... besides the ones we have given them . They were raised in the bellies of Mexican Girls . Cause no one can find anyone . Their fathers were ... Special seeds in bottles . Birthday ? We do not call them baby , or kiss .. Do not think them as children . Think them as students with patents and copyrights . - Comprende ? - Si seneor . They thought we were too poor and stupid to understand . We are poor , yes ... but we are not stupid . Use your powers . This is business . They are making soldiers . Killers . These are babies of mutantes ... North Dakota . You took that woman 's money . You said you would take the child there . What is she ? She is your daughter , Logan . Alkali has your genetic code . Not just mine . Logan ... I do not want to talk about I don 't wanna hear about it anymore . - Logan ... - Just stop . I have to pee . Last ride . You 're welcome .

You know you got to pay for that , right ? Hey ! Where 's your Mommy and Daddy huh ? Come on . That 's enough .. These too . Shit ! Not okay ! I am sorry . Cell phone chargers ? Come on . In the car . As the children became older ... Laura . Laura . They became more difficult . They were not to be controlled . The company made their bodies into weapons . They tried to teach them to kill . But they do not want to fight . A soldier who 'll not fight is useless . Inside this building ... They are working on something new . Something they think is better than the children . Something They say is without a soul . They must have been successful . About a week ago , they told us to shut our programme down . We want to save as many children as we can . I read about a place up North . A place for mutants . They call it Eden . If you 're watching this ... It means that I 'm dead . I am not sure if any other children survived . We were separated . There is no more money . That was a lie . She 's not my child But I love her . You may not love her . But she 's your child . Please . I beg you ... take her to safety . So it 's where we 're hiding out ? Just hiding out . Now we 'll get a couple of hours sleep ... Clean up , get some new clothes , get a new ride , get out of here . Harrah 's Hotel and Casino welcomes you to Oklahoma City . Hey . Endless fun at Harrah 's Hotel Casino .

Thank you . Come here . Stay there . Stand there . Logan , it is yours . What ? Nothing to worry now . We just need the room . We can change in the room . This is a very famous picture , Laura . It 's almost a 100 years old . I first saw this picture in the Essoldo cinema in my own town ... when I was your age . You are in Heaven , hallowed be thy name . Thy Kingdom come , thy will be done ... Shit . Do you read this in your spare time ? Oh yeah , Charles , We have ourselves an X man fan . You do know they are all bullshit right ? Maybe a quarter bit happens , and not like this . In the real world , people die . And I know who self promoting asshole in a fucking This is ice cream for Bed wake . Logan ... Your nurse has been feeding her some great bullshit . I don 't think that Laura needs reminding of Life 's imponents . Didn 't you say something about finding us a new ride ? Two more pills in one hour . Give them to him . Why , Shane ? A man has to be what he is , Joey . Can 't break the moulds . I tried , that didn 't work for me . Joey , there is no like killing ... There is no going back . Right or wrong it is a brand . A brand sticks . Now you run on home to your mother and tell her everything is alright . There aren 't anymore guns in the valley . Who are you guys ? More cops ? cause I told the other guys ... Get up ! In your cage , tracker . You did your job . Fellas . Shit . Knock yourself out . Tell you what . Eight grand ... I 'll have it freshly painted for you , new tires , mounted , balanced and complete paperwork . I 'll give you ten as it is if you can forget the paperwork . Well , you still need new tires .

And took the lives of seven mutants including sevaral of the X men . Knock it off . I said knock it off ! She 's a child , Logan . And point of fact , She is your ... How long has it been since you took your meds ? - Tell me , how long has it been ? - You know ! Two days . You saw what happened yesterday . If that shit , had gone on any longer ... I did what I had to do to save Laura You didn 't do anything . You 'd just freaked out and had a fucking siezure . I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated rambling on like a lunatic So much easier for you . Easier ? Jesus ! There is nothing easy back here . Charles , Nothing ! Please be like the rest of the world . Blaming someone else for your boring shit . I know . I 'm such a giant disappointed . You honestly derived no sense of purpose . from what we are doing ? Okay , what are we doing ? There is a young mutant sitting in our car . Yeah . And where we are taking her , there are others . Does that mean nothing to you ? Oh yeah , yeah it means nothing to me . Especially since nurse Gabriella ... made all that eaten shit up off the fucking comic Books . What are you talking about ? Give those , Take out two pills and give them to him . - Logan , Logan . - Give ' em to him . Now ! I wanna see it . Motherfucking auto trucks . Language Logan . And you 're screaming at a machine . Now what ? She can gut a man with a fitch She can 't hear a few naughty words . She can learn to be better . You mean , better than me ? Actually yes . And by the way , Laura 's foot claws are the obvious result of her gender . Is that a fact ? In a pride of lions , the females ... is both hunter and care giver . Good to Know . She uses her front claws for hunting ... And her back claws defensively . Oh yeah ? Thus ensuring their survival . Hey hey ! Hey , you need a hand ? Ready ? Go ! Good , got it !

He believes you 've been dispensing delayed information . To allow your friends to stay one step ahead . I 'm offering you with possibility of redemption , Caliban . To protect the world and in the process , save your friends . The girl is a small price to pay for that . Unlike you , she isn 't pure . She was not made by nature . She 's a mistake of my own . I did what I could and they burned me and beat me . Your colleagues are savages . I agree . The Reavers were very ineffective But I 'm bringing new tools to bear .

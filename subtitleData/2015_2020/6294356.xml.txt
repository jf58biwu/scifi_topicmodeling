It 'll bring you home each night . Yeah . [ WHIT ] We are doing the right t hing here . [ LISA ] Well , maybe we 're not . Obviously nothing good can come from getting us ... out of this and into a better I ife . Is it too early for me ? Not today . The correct answer is not any d ay . [ WHIT ] I 've trained my ass off for this . [ LISA ] Yeah . Which is why those tactical boy s won 't know what hit them . And whatever you have to do ... you come home to us at the end . Wow .

Oh , no , I was just going throug h the slip logs and I noticed something small , real small ... like a couple of minutes missing g . Now to most , that don 't mean mu ch , but to me ... well , it kinda looks like someo ne might have borrowed time they didn 't have . Probably just an error , somethi ng that small , you know . Or a dirty jump . Who am I talking to here ? My captain ... or my friend ? Both . Maybe you don 't wanna hear this , huh ? Sure he does . Our trouble 's now his trouble . Come on .

No , no , no , I 'm not jumping ! We 're not dirty jumping ! Check the coordinates . Don 't fucking move . What have we got , Dave ? Infini , where the fuck is that ? Come on , show me , show me . It 's off the grid . That can 't be right ! It 's off t he grid ! Check it again ! [ TANNOY ] Lockdown . Delta sequence commencing . Fuck ! What 's delta lockdown ? Dave , what 's delta lockdown ? We 're gonna fucking die , man . We gotta dirty jump , right now . To where those other guys went ? To where those other fucking gu ys went ? The next step after a delta loc kdown is stasis ! You know that , Dave ! Our destination is fixed to whe rever this is and I ain 't fucking going ! We 've gotta jump , now ! Shit , they 're gassing ! Go , go , go ! Just don 't move , don 't move . It 's ... Hang on , hang on . You 're good . Move , move ! He 's d one . Something at APEX is shutting m e out . Fucking fix it ! Your clearances are a little , t oo high to crack ! Dave , you can fix it ! I can 't , it 's not fucking letti ng me in ! I can 't fucking break the code ! Carmichael , you 're out in five . Oh , Jesus . It 's all right , it 's all right . We 're gonna figure this out , ri ght ? Sef , I can 't die here . I don 't wanna die , Sef . I gotta get home . I gotta get home . Buddy boy ? Chief , have you seen these new plasmid readings ? I 'm seeing everything . That 's m y job . Look , if it is not a fucking fa ct ... I don 't wanna know about it . Good morning . Menzies , Jacklar , Huntington ... Captain Johanson , Grenich , Kent ... this is Philipa Boxen , your act ing lieutenant . She 's just passing through . Be nice . Rex Manning 's been drafted in a s added security . You 're gonna fucking need it . In front of you is a sample of what is already in your kits . I 'll get to that in a moment . N ow , listen up . I 'm getting this intel as you a re . There 's way too much conjecture for my liking . I 'm calling bullshit on half of this , remember that . Here we g o . The OI Infini , the furthest out post in our galaxy ... sitting on a rock devoid of lif e , devoid of light ... and frozen to the point of near infinite crush . Claire , you sure you 're all rig ht ? Please , please , be quiet . But what she 's best known for i s the worst deep space disaster in history . 1,600 men and women , all worker s ... killed when the mineral aggrega te opus ... a potential mined energy source unique to that planet ... turned out to be highly volatil e under normal operating conditions . Then why build a station out th ere in the first place ? They should 've known that befor ehand . Yeah , my thoughts exactly . The station was permanently shu t down and all pending shipments halted ... an order classified code Zephyr in the realisation , and I quote ... " A catastrophic global event wa s imminent ... " if the contents of any one pay load ever met with our atmosphere " . Which is where the real shit-st orm occurs . 12 minutes ago , west coast slip stream depot 946 ... attempted to recall research of ficer Montoli Reece ... from active duty on mining stat ion Infini . Now , we know Montoli was part o f an inspection team of 15 ... sent to assess the site followi ng the recent disaster . During the time out there ... something happened to the other members of the crew resulting in their deaths . HQ tried to pull Montoli out ... he crippled his APEX device to remain on the facility . So are we talking villain or sa viour here ? I would definitely go with the former ... expect phenor dementia , maybe e ven rhombust psychosis . Â¶ For he 's a jol ly good fellow So should we be expecting some sort of fire fight out there ? Jacklar , I don 't fucking know . Well , we 've got Rex Mannings . Be prepared for anything . Okay , listen ! Whilst on Infini , Montoli was a ble to bring base operations back online ... via the local network , then sev ered remote connection . He has prepped a payload ... to be delivered to an undisclos ed location here on Earth . Given the slipstreams , is six m inutes from now . I don 't have to tell you how im portant this mission is . Wait . We just lost the west coast . Which squad ? Every single person . The entire division . Shit . They jumped in to extract Monto li . I 'm hearing ... they think it 's a n airborne threat out there . West coast went into lockdown . Goddamn . They had to be lethally quarant ined . What about the ones in the fiel d ? On Infini ? We 're hearing someone had the i nsight to blow out the compartment housing ... that sent the whole station int o a deep freeze . So they 're all dead . No , no ... all but one . Whit Carmichael . 34 , basic grun t , sub-specialty survival tech . Looks like he eventually wanted to become one of you . Smart guy . What did he do ? Records show an illegal jump in to Infini ... assumably to escape the lockdow n . Okay , okay , locator markers hav e him last pegged in the furnace control room . Yeah , that makes sense . It seal s tight in an emergency to protect the core . He 's been out there a week alre ady . His rations will be getting low . A week ? He only left Earth a few minutes ago . Yeah , correc t . So we 're talking serious time d ilation here . Look , I 'm reading a whole bunch of singularity , black hole bullshit ... but basically , you 're gonna be gone for one minute , 14 seconds of our time ... which will give you just over 2 4 hours , one day out there . Okay . Great . Guys , best case scenario , they can get us out of there in two hours . There 's no safety net ! That 's r ight . Yeah . It is a long way from hom e ... the furthest you have ever been . Now , your primary order is to s top that payload leaving Infini ... and bring this Carmichael home . The focused military approach h as proven ineffective . We are relying on you , our best search and rescue team , to get this job done . Deployment in 45 seconds . What 's with the antiques ? Nothi ng else will work out there . We 're hearing current plasma te ch is rendered useless ... against the electrical fields . You will be relying solely on basic packs . Even our readouts ? Everything .. . 30 seconds . There better be a hell of a big bonus for this . You bring this in , I deliver th e credits myself . Your suits are sealed with two layers of resistance ... but won 't stand that level of c old indefinitely . I have marked all generators an d key locations on your maps . You said airborne contagion . It is an assumption , like a lot of this . [ CHIEF ] Ten seconds ! All right , nothing stupid . Safe and steady . There 's a reason they bring us in last , right ? We 'll see you in a m inute . Kent , where are we at ? Storage room . Lower deck , level three . You got any thermal reads ? No , it 's too cold . It 's 70 belo w . I 'm not gonna see anything on t his . Stay on it anyway . I 'm not reading anything for ai r contaminants ... but we are surrounded by some k ind of coolant agent . Boxen . Yeah ? Take Jacklar to find Carmichael . Yes , sir . Menzies , Grenich and Kent , you re on payload . We 'll use the service tunnels . I 've marked your access points on your maps . Keep moving . This cold will set in much faster than you think . All right , Mannings , Huntington , you 're with me to the generators . Everyone stay on the comms . We regroup back in the control room . Boxen , if you find this Carmich ael guy ... if there 's any risk , you call i t in to assess . Got ya , Cap . Payload is priorit y . So is getting home alive . Let 's move . Loud and clear . Jacklar , let 's go . Huntington , move . Don 't touch a nything ! Okay , guys , we got some bodies here . Keep it tight . I must say , I was a bit surpris ed to see you ... at the meeting this morning , Ma nnings . Well , it was a late call . Babys itting mission . For who ? Keep Huntington out of trouble . The babysitter . Yeah , well , it looks that way . Someone wants to make sure you get the east coast command ... not like these poor bastards . What the fuck is he talking abo ut , Huntington ? Last job . He 's moving up in the world . You wanna be in politics , huh ? Governor Huntington . Which way , Huntington ? Should be stairs up the front t here . Man , if there 's anything alive in this shit hole , they gotta b e hearing that . Let 's hope so . Okay , I think we 're good . Holy shit . Look at his neck . Embolised arteries ... interesti ng . Yeah . This cold 's worse than whatever screwed with the plasmids . Tell me about it . My PDA is fuc ked . All right , two more cross secti ons down on our right ... will lead through to operations . Let 's move . Could use a little heat in this place , you know ? This guy did a real number here . What are your thoughts ? You know what ? Actually not tha t hard . The software might be a differe nt trick , though . What 's powering this ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's a good quest ion . It 's definitely on a different circuit to the station . Wait , wait . Listen . Metal on metal . Let 's move . Claire , heat will be on soon . Just focus on having that panel prepped , okay ? Still reading all clear on the air . As expected , these particles sh ow traces of human compounds ... zinc , magnesium , H2O , but nothi ng harmful . Don 't sound so disappointed , Me nzies . Just hoping for something other than this goddamn cold to kill me . Come on ! Rex ! Yeah . Okay , we got a body , Seet . Two o 'clock . Clear ? Clear . What the fuck is that ? Hey , don 't touch ! I don 't know what it is . Right through the neck . No entry point . Let 's get to th e generators . Huntington , where are the gener ators ? Two doors on the left . Copy tha t . Let 's move . Move . Okay , just don 't touch . Jesus Christ . Oh , man . Nine days in this place ? Who kn ows what 's through that door . I 'm gonna try him . Whit Carmich ael , this is Philipa Boxen ... with SS Tier 1 Search and Rescu e . Can you hear me ? Ask again . Whit Carmichael , this is Philip a Boxen ... with SS Tier 1 Search and Rescu e . Can you hear me ? Nothing ? Nah , wall 's too thick . No way r eception 's getting through . Fucking gloves . I 'm used to doing this with my fingers . I 'm gonna take a look at the su rrounds . Yeah . Yeah , go . I need a moment with this fucki ng thing . The furnace is running on bare minimum , and we 've lost contact with Carmichael . Closing these vents would be a good start . Generator , what 's the deal ? Chester 's working on it . I 'm looking for the bar . BOXEN What did you just say ? Mannings , did you just say you were looking for a bar ? Just making sure I 'm the first fucking asshole ... to be eaten by the monsters whe n they appear . SEET Boxen , Mannin gs , off the comms . Huntington , I found the mess ha ll . Nothing happening here . Don 't fucking be mean ! Don 't be mean ! My balls are fucking shrinking from the cold , you son of a fucking bitch ! Hello ! Yeah ! Okay , good job , guys . Good job . Kent , we got a program here and it looks like it 's running ... I don 't know ... Yeah , I 'm seeing the same thing . Can you work it ? Do you know any Latin ? Why woul d I ? Exactly . It 's a dead language , just like this one . Give me a second , I 'll see what I can do . Cap , are you seeing this ? Guys , give me a minute . Go dark on comms . What 's happening ? Cap , you on top of this ? Cap , you getting this ? The air is purging ! Hey , what d id you do ? I 'm not doing it . Tell me what s going on here , man . I can 't find Rex . Seet , what 's going on ? Rex , where the hell are you , ma n ? Cap , you touch something ? Cap ! Aghh ! Everybody , stay where you are . We 're not in control here . Is everyone feeling okay ? Relax . We 're stabilising . Time to get warm . It 's just steam , guys , it 's ste am . Oh , fuck , my visor 's cracking ! Yeah , yeah , they build them str ong , okay ? Temp is skyrocketing , but you w ill hold . Trust me . It 's okay . The suit will hold . We got movement ! [ BOXEN ] We may have contact wit h Carmichael . Stand by . [ SEET ] Copy that . Be careful . Raise your hands . Raise your hands now ! Where we can see them . You 've got about two seconds be fore I light you up . Raise your fucking hands now ! S lowly . Identify yourself . What 's your name ? What 's your name , soldier ? Carmichael . My name is Whit Carmichael . I had to be certain . 100 percent certain that you gu ys weren 't like the others . As in the rest of your squad ? As in every fucking soldier tha t slipstreamed in here ! This place was a fucking slaugh ter house . It started with the miners atta cking and then everything , everyone , they just ... Wait . I thought all the miners were killed in a blast . Yeah , well , no one fucking told them that ! These guys were fucking berserk . They were deformed and they wer e real strong and they were fucking insane ! What caused it ? If not airborne , then what ? I don 't know ... I don 't know if it 's a ... It 's contagion of sorts . I don t fucking know . Whenever they touched each othe r , skin to skin or fucking blood or whatever ... these guys were clawing at thei r skin like it was burned in a c id . It was like these ... It was like these urges just ov ertook them . That 's some urge . My APEX didn 't fire . I thought I 'd get home , I didn t . Your entire west coast sector w as lethally quarantined . Nobody was there to bring you h ome . And how did you manage to be th e only one left alive ? I hid . I hid inside a fucking ducting vent . And I fucking crawled away . And I found myself in this room , in this furnace room . It was powered on a separate ro ute to the main line . And then when I ... I fired up t he monitors ... and when I saw what was still f ucking going on ... I blew the external vents and I sealed myself in . Killing everybody in here . Fuck ! [ BOXEN ] He did what he had to do . Take mine . That 's some story . In the mess hall , I found human body parts removed and placed in their cat egories based on their functionality . What can you tell me about that ? I had fucking nothing to do wit h that , man . I swear . There 's no one else on the stat ion , right ? Almost the entire station 's bee n exposed to the freeze . I 've seen nothing on the monito rs since , no movement , nothing . And you turned everything on ... the power , the vents , everything g , right ? My first job out of term school was writing code . This stuff , it 's old , it runs o n ASCII and basic binary . It 's just maths and simple comm ands . Wait , wait , wait . You figured out how to run the entire stati on through that ? It just took a little time . I 'v e had fucking plenty of that . Whit , listen ... we need to take the payload off line permanently . Can you do it ? You motherfuckers aren 't here f or me at all , are you ? Of course we are . Shut the fuck up ! It 's just the order . When do we leave ? Chester will recode your APEX . I said how fucking long until w e slipstream home ? Just over 22 hours . No . No , no , no , no , no . Hey . You got a family ? You got kids ? My wife 's pregnan t . We will get you home . Okay ? But you have to help us first . We need your help . Just get me the fuck out of her e . What are you doing ? Give me a second and don 't touc h anything . How do we know this guy is in t he same ... I don 't wanna talk about this h ere . Come on . Come on . X is 3247 minus 450Z . That 's 124 ... That 's a 4 ... 148 . It 's 148 . Pacific Ocean just off San Fran cisco . That 's where your payload 's hea ded . Are you sure ? Yes . God , I need someone to go back down to operations ! For what ? I think I can get the payload o ffline . I just need someone down there on the dials . You mean , the terminal ? It 's st ill pretty raw . I can do the terminals from her e . I just need someone down there to force the override . I 'm on it . Cap ! Go . Whit , patch in to my comms , fre quency 12.107 . Grenich , Jacklar , go with him . Hey , what 's that guy 's name ? Me nzies . Harris Menzies . Be safe . Hey , you look after th em . Hey , Menzies , you hear me ? Loud and proud . Okay , just hold tight . I expect an early extraction af ter this . You deliver and so will I. You know what ? You guys should check this out . Take a look out this window . Why ? Just check it out . At least now we know what 's pow ering the station . You 've certainly been a welcome addition , Carmichael . [ WHIT ] Promised my wife I 'd be home for dinner . Technically , it 's not even lunc h back on Earth . [ WHIT ] Ten minutes , that 's all I 've been gone . Does your head in if you think about it too much . [ WHIT ] It 's the only thing that 's kept me going . Yeah , I 've got a little girl ex pecting me at a school science fair this afternoon . You got a daughter ? Yeah . How old ? Six . What 's her name ? Josephine Emma . That 's a beautiful name . Thanks . What do you tell her when you g o to work ? What are we supposed to do with this ? It 's shot . Daddy loves you all the way to the Milky Way . Not the short way , but the long way . Are you in that room yet ? Are y ou in the furnace room yet ? Yeah . Just hold tight . We didn 't need you to come down here with us . I can do this on my own . What can you do on your own , Cl aire ? Look at our lives , Morgan . Look at it . It wouldn 't work . Yeah , look at our lives . A chil d needs support on all levels . Claire , I would walk away from this in a heartbeat . [ WHIT ] Menzies , are you standin g by ? Yeah . [ WHIT ] I need the furnaces to t hink they 're gonna go critical ... that way I can access the overr ide . You understand ? Yeah . Grenich , I need you on the valv es . Which one ? Start at B3 and you work your w ay round from there . I would 've done the same thing , Whit . I would 've locked myself up in this control room . And I would 've blown these exte rnal vents . Fuck ' em , right ? Gotta think of yourself . You had a wife . Baby on the way , right ? That 's what you gotta be thinki ng about , I get it . Are you infected , Whit ? Whit ? Are you infected ? Let me look at your eyes . Let me see your eyes . If you don 't show me your eyes ... Do I look infected ? Hm ? Look . Take a good look . Huh ? If I was infected , I would 've r ipped ... your fucking east coast throat out by now , trust me . Now , why don 't you fuck off and let me do your job ? It 's nothing to worry about . It 's just the alarm for the override . It lasts about ten minutes . Tha t 's all . Carmichael , have you done this kind of thing before ? Okay , Grenich , you start winding g your way back right now ! Go ! Yeah . I 'm turning . Safety valve off . Gauge isn 't responding ! It 's in the red ! Should we be worried ? No . It 's just because the furna ces are hitting critical , that 's all . What ? Carmichael , the furnaces at cri tical could take this whole place apart . She 's right . Shit ! Carmichael , you okay with this ? Yeah , I got it , I got it ! My people are down there . Menzies ! Now ! Go now ! We need to bring this down , Car michael . Menzies , I need those levels dr opped on the furnace ! Tell me when they 're in amber ! Grenich ! Jacklar ! Where are we at ? Already falling . Cap , we 're out of the red . Yes ! Captain , your payload is offlin e . Good work , Menzies . We regroup in the control room . Loud and clear . Let 's get the fuck out of here . Okay , I am now deleting all con trols beyond that so that no one else ... Chester ! Mannings , med kit ! Chester , get over here ! Fuck ! Chester ! Chester ! Get over ther e ! [ MENZIES ] What 's going on up th ere ? The captain 's been attacked . Cap ? Come on . Check his wound . No ! Wait ! Wait ! They need us , M enzies . Carmichael , do you hear me ? Wait ! I don 't wanna die . You said the re was no one else in here ! Seet ! Seet ! Rex ! Jesus , Rex ! Fuck ! Get it out of me ! Help me ! Help me , Charlie ! Get it out of me ! Carmichael ! Menzies , you stay away . You find somewhere and you fuck ing hide . You hear me ? Stay away ! Come on . Come on . Come on . Whit ! Hey , Whit . I can hear you breat hing . I can hear your heart beating . Whit ! Whit ! Where are you ? Carmichael ! You told me this place was secu re ! Whit ! Whit ! Carmichael ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I just wanna talk to you . I jus t wanna talk to you for a seco n d . I need your help . We could help each other . I can help you . Come on . Come on . I 'm sorry . I don 't know what to do . You 're a dead man .

Move suddenly and I shoot . No hesi-fucking-tation ! You don 't move ! Answer me , you fucking got it ? Yes ! Just fucking let me go ! Now get up ! Show me those hands ! You look like fucking shit . How the fuck do you expect me t o look ? You don 't look so fucking great yourself . How did you find me ? I was in h ere before you arrived . You were in the locker the whol e time ? Only when I heard footsteps . Can 't trust anyone right now . Can I put my hands down now ? Ho w did you avoid exposure ? Answer me ! Easy ! Easy ! Easy ! Ea sy ! Easy ! I was in the control room . I wa s on the other side of the roo m . The ship went down on one side , I was over there talking to yo u , remember ? Daddy loves you to the Milky Wa y .

Everyone else got infected . Everyone . There was blood every where . I don 't know about Morgan . I don 't know how he got infected . But I saw him . Morgan attacked Charlie right i n front of me . They didn 't know I was there . Morgan ... Morgan killed Charlie . He left him . He left his gun an d I took it and I ran . I swear . You got any idea what the fuck s going on ? I 'm starting to .

Only not in the way they want . I 've never heard of anything li ke this . You never had sea monkeys as a kid ? It 's just like them . Basically , they 're saying that it 's like an archetype of life . Extreme evolution , wherever it goes , whatever it touches . So why is everyone getting so f ucked up ? I think because its basic insti nct is predatory . It 's looking for an alpha among us . Something from which it can gro w , can evolve . It just wants to exist . It does n 't realize the consequence to us . I doubt it would care , either . It 's not capable of understandi ng . Not yet , anyway . Like a cancer . How do we stop it ? I don 't think we can .

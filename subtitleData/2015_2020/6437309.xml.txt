Morgan : MARY , WHEN YOU AND YOUR TWIN BROTHER started looking glass nearly 10 years ago now , did you ever imagine you 'd end up with a billion users ? otto wrote that code to help people connect . That number one billion shows how hungry people are to connect with each other . But human connection is something that otto has always struggled with , and he spoke only to you till he was 9 years old and then only the language of his own invention . And people are saying two things . I WANT TO PUT THESE TO YOU VERY STRONGLY TONIGHT . THE OBVIOUS QUESTION FOR YOU ... Otto : COME ON , MARY . ... IS OTTO BURNT OUT ? SAY YES .

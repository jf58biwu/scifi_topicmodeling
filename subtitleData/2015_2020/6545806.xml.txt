Other than the kidnapping and the gun-running . She works a clerical job at a museum . art classes . Artist turned gun-runner . Kind of sexy . No record . It doesn 't add up . She got powers . That 's how it adds up . Andrew was a lovely head shrinker Before he turned into a not-so-lovely Inhuman serial killer . Point made . Fair enough . is this the accomplice that you mentioned ? that 's him . Her cousin . Lives by her . Also no record . Why are they taking those weapons ? Hunter and I will go track them down .

I think we were wrong about her . Ask her about the convoy . Why 'd she take those weapons ? [ tires screech ] [ shouting in spanish ] But ... They belong to the police . Thieves in uniform .

[ explosion ] [ rumbling ] Joey : What is that ? Hydra . No . no . She 's not wrong . She 's a perfect fit for this team you 're trying to build . Except for the pesky little fact she doesn 't want any part of it . she 's also vulnerable out there . keeping her close . It 's safer . Don 't look at me like that . Is it safer ? Like the 12 inhumans lash killed . It 's hard to build a team If everyone 's spread over the world . And we weren 't on the same continent . Huh . it could work . Let 's hope the director agrees . [ watch beeps ] we 're a tap away . Backup . I 'm ... I 'm sorry for kidnapping you . I 'll see you soon ... Yo-yo . mack . Goodbye . How about you ? Maybe you don 't have to miss dinner this Sunday . [ keyboard clacking ] When did you get done ? earlier today . I think he 's gonna like this one . How are you ? Must be fascinating Getting to know all about inhuman dna and ... I miss you . There it is . I miss you . I 'm here . Together . We 're ... And there 's this chasm in the middle of the room and ... because ... Because maybe there was another way ... And there was something else that I could 've done . Will died saving me . a monster .

Letting him live a normal life like everyone else ? you 're not . I mean offering you the same deal . Your apb 's been lifted . No one 's looking for you . You could go back to your old life if you want . I don 't know . It 's pretty interesting here . I was hoping you 'd say that . You 're trusting them more . It 's good to delegate . So it 's not because you don 't trust yourself . It looks good . Fitz outdid himself on this one . Lots of bells and whistles . It 's pretty fantastic . May I ? [ chuckles ] Feels real . Feels like the others . It 's not the hand . It 's me . Maybe you 're not supposed to get over it . Some things you can 't move past . change you permanently . on that planet . I do . You joined the cavalry . [ tablet beeps ] Gothite industry closed 10 offices today . Their stock prices continue to tumble as investor react . Gideon malick could not be reached for comment . sometimes you wound . But he 's still collecting inhumans . Any theories as to why ? Lincoln said inhuman powers create a balance an equilibrium . We got a lot of heroes on our side . Makes me wonder what malick has on his . Malick : Did we get the inhuman ? But they say his powers are strong . At least we get some good news today . but you don 't know if you can . Coulson survived . Could be you 're not who I thought you were . You 'll believe ... Once I make a believer out of him . It makes perfect sense to name him the head of the atcu . The public respects military authority ... You 've worked together . I wouldn 't exactly call it " together . He has the utmost respect for you . Now I know you 're lying . he 'll be taking orders from you . And I 'm sure he 's thrilled about that . coulson . Mr. President . [ monitor beeps ] [ breathes deeply ] boy .

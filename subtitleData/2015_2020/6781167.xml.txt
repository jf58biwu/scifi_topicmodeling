 People are dead . Rachel is dead . My mum , she was paralysed in a car accident . Our teacher here was the Quill 's leading terrorist ... Freedom fighter ! " We 're just little asses of smart " " who don 't even know what evil looks like . " We were so busy fighting amongst ourselves . We never saw them coming . Why aren 't you trying to make me talk about it ? My dad died almost two years ago . A stroke . Daddy ? It isn 't you . It is . I 've reached out to you . Across all of time and space . Because dead people are doing that all the time . I mean , you hear about it constantly . The stroke came so suddenly . One moment I was here ... And the next you were gone . There is so much that I wanted to say to you . - You 're not him . - I am . I am a part of you , puddle . - I 'm out of here . - I 'm your father , Jasper . I married your mother Vivian , and then two years later , - We had your brothers . - You died two years ago today . - I was at your grave with mum ... - I know that , puddle . But I 'm here now . I know how much pain you 're in . I can help with that pain . Won 't you take my hand ? No . I don 't think I 'm dealing with this very well . Alien invasion or teen angst ? " Teen angst " is a pejorative phrase . He 's upstairs . - What 's wrong ? - They 've thrown me out . Come on , Tanya . Where are you ? - Hey . - You seen Tanya ? No , she 's not been around today . It 's the anniversary of her dad 's , um ... I know that . She 's more my friend than yours . Why does it have to be a competition ? Did you understand the physics homework ? What ? Don 't " oh " me . Fine . Though I didn 't understand all of it either . Is that a keyboard ? You play that , too ? Yeah . I write sometimes . You write songs ? No . Nothing . Let 's get to physics . Was argument . One we had many times . About boys . Then became about you . It was almost okay I liked boys . But my father ... If I don 't have a boyfriend , he doesn 't have to think about it . But you ... You exist . You are real person . Did this really happen ? Because of course I 'll get it . I once led an army . Yes , all right . You aren 't supposed to just drop by in this country . She 's the worst teacher I 've ever had . I don 't know how nobody notices she does barely anything . I don 't know . So , what I did on question three was ... What was that ? Someone just knocked at my window . And that 's weird ? I 'm on the first floor . Hello , Andra 'ath . No one knows that name . No one alive knows that name . Therefore ... - Therefore you 're a dead woman . Or you 're going to be . Come , come , andra 'ath , a fight ? Then again , maybe that would be the best greeting . Mum ? I 'll see you in the morning . I hope . Ram ! You have to see what that is ! Screw you ! I don 't have to do anything ! I 've done plenty already . Ram ? - Come on . - Ram , what 's happening ? That is just not fair . Holy mother of kanye . Rachel . Why me ? Why not mum ? Or your sons ? We go to the strongest pull first . The one who misses us the most . You were like a siren song when we stepped into this world . But how can I possibly miss you more than mum does ? Because she 's already let me go . It 's this shape , I know . Some morphic resonance thing I don 't understand . One has to make allowances for other planets . Surely , though , even in this skin that you yourself wear so well , andra 'ath , Surely you recognise your own sister . How ? - How are you here ? - That 's a story and a half . - I ain 't going nowhere . - You aren 't going anywhere . The correct words aren 't always the right ones . Well , that 's true , isn 't it ? That 's what I always used to say to you . - That 's what my dad used to tell me . - Fair enough . All right . We are ... The lankin . Aliens . - So you 're not him . - I am . - You just said ... - The universe is so big . So big you wouldn 't believe it . Yes . Actually , I would . So who are the lankin ? They gather souls , puddle . They gather our souls . Or they can , if we let them . Quill don 't have souls . We do , we just believe they die with us . We 're wrong about that . The lankin look after them . They shepherd them . Where to ? Heaven ? If heaven is being with the souls of everyone you 've ever known , then yes . Sounds like hell . That , too . What do you get out of it ? Souls give off energy . A perpetually renewing power source . It 's mutually beneficial . The more souls that gather together , The more energy the lankin have . So why are you here ? If you take my hand , I can ease your pain . Our souls will connect . So that when it comes to your time , many years from now , You 'll be able to find me . Dad , I know we 've talked about the weird stuff , but ... Dad , call me as soon as you get this . Ram ! You can stay here as long as you need . What if that 's forever ? Then it 's forever . You know , these weeks with you ... I knew you were different . But now that I know why , it doesn 't matter . Because you are still you . In all your strangeness . Same here . Charlie . I would like to say something . But I don 't want you to think it 's because of this situation . - Okay . - Do not laugh at me . - Is it funny ? - No . Because sometimes I miss the human sense of humour . I mean , have you seen that show , take me out ? I love you . Do you have love where you come from ? What about Miss Quill ? I told her never to intrude unless the world is actually ending . We 've never gathered the souls of this race . Not until cracks in the universe starting appearing here . We found a few souls we could help . But we 'd like to help more . Right , so this is a sales pitch ? And you 've chosen a human picture of my sister to be your mouthpiece . Tell me again why I shouldn 't kick your ass right now . The shadow kin attack happened so fast , sister , No one knew it was their last day . I know we 've rarely seen eye-to-eye , but ... You tried to kill me in the nest . All quill sisters do that . It 's how we know the survivors are strong . We allow you to properly say goodbye . And thereby ensure you will find one another in the hereafter . This is sounding suspiciously sentimental . Exactly the sort of nonsense . That would lead one of these ridiculous humans into a trap . It 's symbiotic . You give to me as I give to you . Why does that have to be a bad thing ? I 've had bad luck with aliens recently . Well , we 're not all evil . And there 's so much good in the universe . So much good . You 're hesitating . You 're wondering , " what if ? " There 's so much I wanted to tell you . - And so much I wanted to say ... - I know , son . Take your mother 's hand and tell her . - Mama ? - Son . What was that ? A soul saying goodbye . Not as clean as we 'd have liked . A lot of anger there . We 're kind of a messier species than the lankin is used to . It 's so sad when we can 't let go properly . In my world , love is a practical term , it 's almost a business one . It means to combine what you have with what someone else has . It 's the combination that means love , not the wish to do it . The wish told you where love might be found . It wasn 't love itself . What are you saying ? That my wish isn 't love ? - No ... - Because if not , Then I 've given up very much for a pointless wish . No , no , no , that 's not what I 'm saying . Here you have so much choice . But if your family is wrong for you , you can choose a different one . My family . They never saw me as someone they needed to bother combining with . I was a valuable piece of property . To be used for the good of the country . The wish ... My wish had nothing to do with it . I wish for you . You wish to combine with me ? Yes , isn 't that what we just ... sometimes I think you play stupid . How about that fight ? Matron 's rules . No mercy . That would get in the way . It 's our limitation . We have to stay attached to the great trunk . It 's how the souls connect . I can only come this far to you . You have to come the rest of the way . Why ? Because souls can never be forced . They can only be persuaded . What can I say to make you believe me ? Puddle . Won 't you take your father 's hand ? Won 't you take your sister 's hand ? Tell me why you call me puddle . We were watching the regimental horses at hyde park . One of them did an absolutely enormous wee . And you , not knowing what it was , jumped right into it . " Puddle ! Puddle ! Puddle ! " you said . Horse wee everywhere . That ... That doesn 't mean that ... That just means you can read my mind . It doesn 't mean that you 're actually you . Suppose that 's true , yes . There 's no way to convince you . You just have to believe me . I really want to . I want you to . I 've missed you so much . Dad ? April , I think the world is ending . How do I know that you 're not just some chameleon ? Chameleon ? An animal they have here . It changes its skin to match its background . Useful for camouflage . Have you made contact with their leaders ? Chameleons hide themselves . So what I am wondering is , what is it you 're hiding ? Maybe you should ask yourself , what am I offering ? What are they ? I don 't know , but it was connected to rachel . Yeah , I saw . That 's just not on . That 's not even the third weirdest thing I 've seen this month . You 're shaking . Well , the world 's ending . The dead have come back for us . Maybe . Maybe there 's another explanation . Do you always have to be so goddamn sensible ? - Yes . - What ? Yes , I do always have to be so goddamn sensible . Why ? Why do you say that ? Because the world isn 't sensible . Haven 't you noticed ? Yeah . I 've noticed . I decided a long time ago . That I could either let that break me into pieces , Or make sure that it never got the chance . You just think I 'm nice or sensible , but really , it 's war . I 'm always at war . Can we please get out of here before we become one of those ? What are you offering ? Do you remember what you said to me the last time you saw me ? That if I saw you again , I 'd rip your heart out with my bare hands . And make you watch . Good times . Well ... I 'd like to see you try . That 's interesting . Wait a minute . I need to breathe . Did you mean that ? - Mean what ? - Being at war all the time . My dad ... He was a folk singer . He played the fiddle . Made people cry with it . Okay , made me cry . He was always away on tour so we didn 't see him very much , But it was nice when we did . And then it got less nice . He drank . A lot . And , then he drank more . When I was eight years old , he purposely drove off a motorway . With me and my mum in the car . My mum was in the passenger seat , And that 's why she 's paralysed . I was sitting in the back , but I didn 't get hurt . He said it was a suicide attempt , That he wasn 't thinking straight , But he still went to prison for it . And I got lots of therapy , loads of it . People were really nice . So nice , but also careful . Like me and my mum were just glass figurines . I 'm not made of glass . What he did , it 's important , but if it 's the thing that rules , Then he gets to keep doing that to us every day forever . And I won 't have that . I play folk music because I love it . I won 't let him take that from me . And that 's why I 'm so goddamn sensible . You 're still shaking . Did you see ... Did you see that ? It looked like my . Parents . Do you often see your parents after sex ? What is wrong with the sky ? Why is no one answering their phones ? It 's like olden times or something . Probably ' cause they 're all already dead . A little optimism wouldn 't kill you , Ram . No . Alien shadows will kill me . Alien tattoos will kill me . - Alien ... - It 's coming from the tear . Why is there only one ? I 'm not sure . But that 's the way to Tanya 's flat . There 's something you need to know . Something I didn 't tell you . My dad was a policeman . I know that , puddle ... My mum used to worry every night . Worry when he 'd work shifts . That he wouldn 't come home . " It 's not America " , I 'd say . And every night you 'd go out . And every night , you 'd come home . And even if it was really late , like , Even if it was , like , 03 : 00 in the morning ... I 'd look in on you . You 'd look in on me . And I 'd always wake up . Do you know why I did that ? Because I used to do it , too . When I was little , like , little , little . I 'd ... get out of bed . And come to your door . And look inside and ... And I 'd ask , " what are you doing , puddle ? " And I wouldn 't say anything . But you knew . You knew . You were making sure we hadn 't gone anywhere in the night . Because . How could something so good ever last ? And it didn 't . I hated you for leaving . Everything was perfect . We were all so happy . And then you just left ? I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , daddy . I just ... please . Puddle . Come to your daddy . Let him lessen your pain . Let him tell you how I still watch over you . Do you want it ? Come and take it . It has to be your choice . My choice ? That 's how the lankin works . I can only reach out . You have to reach back . I thought you were just giving me time to say goodbye . And this is how you 'll do it . Hey , have you seen the ... Who 's this ? - Finally . - Finally what ? Finally you 've come down from your little love nest , And are therefore implicitly under threat . Which means I can finally find out . Who this infuriating wolverine actually is . What ? Get a very big knife . No , wait . Get two . Why her ? She never hurt anybody . - Nightvisiting . - What ? Nightvisiting . It 's a genre of folk song . My god , I 've heard more about folk music in the last half an hour . Than in my entire previous life . There 've been songs for centuries . About people coming to your window at night . Usually ghosts of people you 've lost . Like Rachel . - What do they want ? - Sometimes it 's a warning . Sometimes ? Sometimes they want to drag you down with them . You have no idea what you 're giving up . Do shut up , sis . " Sis " ? And I got a screwdriver and some secateurs . I specifically asked for knives . I don 't ... I don 't like knives . I can 't use weapons , remember ? Right , stab that in its hand . I ... Go on , you take your time . Come on , what do you think this is ? Really bad phlegm ? Good . Move . Now , let 's have a little chat . Just , like , 100 missed calls from April . We are at Tanya 's . What 's going on ? I think we 're about to find out . Is Tanya in danger ? Well ? We came to offer you release . Yeah . Go get her . We 'll be there as fast as we can . It 's bad . Then we 're gonna save her . No . Ram ! You made one mistake . That 's not how the lankin works . The lankin aren 't a people . You 're a person . You are a chameleon , I 'll give you that . Taking these shapes . You see , the other thing about chameleons , Really long tongues , Which they shoot out to catch their prey . You 're just the tip of the tongue . Such a succulent species . Your grief so large . It will not matter what you do to this limb . I 've found a grief that will make me stronger . Than you little worms can imagine . - What a drama queen . - She must have meant Tanya . April says the main strand of it goes into her flat . - Let 's kill it . - You 're with us ? No one disgraces the memory of my sister by making her nice . - By the way , Matteusz lives with us now . - Whatever . I 've missed you so much . I 've missed you . Take it . This is how it works . Two streets up , then left ! They re-form as soon as you cut them ! What 's it doing ? My guess is it 's gathering strength . To do what ? Like veins of a heart . It all leads to one branch . Where 's the rest of her family ? What happens when I take your hand ? You become free . Free from pain . Free from worry . Free from this grief that haunts you . How ? Would you please just listen to your father for once , young lady ? Tanya ! Don 't go to them . Why didn 't mum open the door for them ? I feed on your release ! Where are my brothers ? I 've never felt a species so in love with closure . The sweetness of the taste . - Hi . - Hi . What the ... You are my heart in this world , puddle . I 'm not letting you go . " Puddle " ? And once my heart has rooted , How I shall feed . You 're going to have to go through us first . Very well . This will not be enough . Give me your hand , or I will kill your family . Will you let my friends go ? Tanya , don 't ! Can 't you see ? Then your mum will have lost you without saying goodbye , And it gets to feed again . On her . It 's a cycle ! I will let them go . There 's only so much even I can consume . You 'll take away my pain forever ? Forever . No . Tanya , no ! Something 's happening . Release ! Tanya ! No ! What are you doing to me ? Unclean ? You are not my father ! What have you done to me ? You know , us humans are a messy species . I told you , I hated my father for leaving . My grief may be strong , but my anger is stronger . And that 's what I gave you . You poisoned me ! You don 't get to have my closure ! So how does that taste ? Bitter . You have weakened me . But not enough . She didn 't ... - Where did she get that ? - She 's resourceful . No ! No ! No ! I 'm so glad that worked . My mum ! What on earth is this mess ? What 's going on ? I 've spoken to a few . None of them seem to remember anything . Which seems really convenient . The lankin probably does it so it can come back and feed again . It 'll think twice before coming back here . - Hey . - You all right ? How 'd you know to come here ? Thanks . My mum doesn 't remember anything . Yeah , I just said that . - Did you guys see anyone ? - I saw Rachel . - Ram . - Tell me about it . My dad is the wrong kind of lost . I saw my parents , but only briefly . Our bond was not strong . I 've got different ones that are stronger . We all do . We beat it together . Finally , we did something as a team . My god , I 'm going to vomit . Where did you get a bus from ? - I should really be walking you home . - Ram , don 't you listen ? Not glass . April ? Any time you want to come nightvisiting ... That 's not how I meant it . I will see you at school , Ram . 'Cause of the folk music . That 's all I meant . Hey , as long as you need , I mean it . We 'll make it work . Thank you . I ... Thank you . I am a warrior of the quill race . And a warrior needs a gun . The water was so cold . He knew it , too . Made a fool of himself just to get my attention . He was quite handsome . He was very handsome , with that smile . That 's how I wanted to remember him . Me , too . Goodbye , dad . Dorothea Ames , new head teacher . My ... Somewhere out there this heart beats . April ! April 's in trouble . No !

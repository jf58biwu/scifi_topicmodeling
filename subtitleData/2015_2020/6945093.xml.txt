 - What is this ? - You have visitors . - No , I don 't know anybody ! - Have a seat , asshole ! - You may leave now . - Ma 'am , I don 't think ... - We 'll be quite alright . Thank you . My apologies , Mr. mccray . My name is Jules holloway , and I work for a large technology firm called pac sinclair . You might 've heard of us . I 'm here to discuss ... - You people never quit . You 're wasting your time . - I 'm here to discuss an opportunity . We are interested in information . - What I know is only good for one thing . - It seems you have intimate knowledge of a proprietary security system inside the milcore industry complex . - How do you know that ? - You come highly recommended . - From who ? - Someone who 's opinion I 'm inclined to respect . Mr. mccray , we can get your sentence reduced , see that you are treated better in here , in exchange for your information . - Word gets out I get special treatment , I 'll be dead inside a week . - I 'm prepared to offer you a full pardon in exchange for your cooperation . - I 'm through playing . Who the hell are you ? - The emergency powers act , Mr. mccray . The world has changed in the two years since your incarceration . It 's chaos out there . We have new enemies and we need new tools to fight them . - I have enough enemies . I don 't need new ones . - Perhaps you 'd rather stay in here . - What 's the job ? - I 'm leading a team of specialists on rather a delicate assignment . I can 't tell you more at this time . - You don 't look like a crook . Except for the suit . - Hey , okay , okay . I 'm in . - You should know that , as a member of my team , you will be required to submit yourself on certain procedures . The refusal of which ... - I 'm in . Forfeiture of contract . I want you to have a clear understanding of your obligations in this matter . - You get me out of this shit hole , and I 'll do anything you want . That clear enough ? - Very well , Mr. mccray . Your transfer orders will be processed immediately . - Are we recording ? Now your eye will be light sensitive for a minute . But the implant should not affect your vision . How 's your vision ? - Ah , it 's a little blurry . - That 'll pass . - Everything within parameters . - Mccray . - Decker . Long time . - Eight years . - At least . So , you in on this ? - Your benefactor . - Oh , that was you ? Well , with you involved , i know we 're up to no good . - It 's a high profile objective for the company . We needed the best . - I never guessed you for a suit . - I got tired of playing for the losing side . Glad you 're on board , bill . - I guess I owe ya . - Yeah , you do . You need to meet the rest of the crew . That 's Natalie kaneko . Natalie . Old friend of mine , Billy mccray . - Hey . - She 's on building security . And that Kyle eisler , he 's the building engineer . Kyle . - Hey . - Only the best . - Testing data feed overlay . Ready ? - Oh shit . - It 's completely undetectable . - Hers isn 't . - The swelling will subside . - You have a broadband data link right in your head . - Oh , just what I always wanted . - This is how the game is played now , bill . - This is what you agreed to . You 'll learn to appreciate the implants , even rely on them . - I rely on myself . - What did I tell ya ? - Meet us in the briefing room as soon as you 're released . Training starts immediately . - Just like the good old days , right ? Except now no one 's shooting at us . - Deadly force is authorized for any violation of the emergency powers act within the milcore green zone . Surrender any electronic devices before approaching the security scanner . There are no electronic devices of any kind permitted in the milcore green zone . Please proceed in an orderly fashion . Possession of electronic devices by non-authorized personnel is a direct violation of the emergency powers act . Any sudden or erratic movement while waiting for your security scan may be interpreted as a threatening posture . Deadly force is authorized for any violation of the emergency powers act . - Earthquake ! - Report to security station . Evacuation protocols are in effect . Do not attempt to use the elevators . Use the stairwells . This is not a drill . This is an emergency situation . Evacuation protocols are in effect . Exit the compound in an orderly fashion . - Wait , wait . - This is not a drill . There is an emergency situation . - Hey ! - Get off ! Get off ! - Oh , Jesus . - Kyle . - Oh god . Oh god . Oh god . - Evacuation orders are in effect . Exit the building in an orderly fashion . There is an emergency situation . - Alright , alright . - Use the stairwell . This is not a drill . There is an emergency situation in the south entrance security station . Evacuation order is in effect . - I 'm offline . - Me too . - I don 't have a display , I 'm blank . - We just lost the feed . - How do we get it back ? - Where 's the chopper ? The pickup was supposed to be right now . - The pickup was 10 seconds ago . - We 're blind here , guys . - We need to reestablish the link . - Stay calm . Everyone stay calm . Did milcore know about this ? - They don 't have the intel to pick up our signal . - They have no idea what 's going on . - Not yet . - What are we doing ? - We don 't have a lot of time . How much time do we have before they reach those guards ? - They 'll start the sweep on the first floor . Any time now . - We take the elevator to the basement . - No , we wait for the chopper . - There is no chopper . - I wanna wait . - Me too . - We should go . - We won 't get another chance at this . - We take it with us . - No , this is bullshit . I 'll take my chances on the street . - If we don 't retrieve the device , it is total forfeiture of contract . - Pax sinclair will eventually reestablish contact just to track you down , track us all down . We don 't have a choice , bill . Jules . - Okay . Alright , we 're wastin ' time . - Kyle , make that elevator go to the basement fast . - We 're locked in . - What ? - I can override the security protocol . We 'll free fall to the basement . - Wait . - That way they can 't stop us . It 'll work . - Do it . - Kyle . Any exit through the basement ? - I 'm on it . You might wanna grab some floor . - What ? - Go , go , go , go , go . - We are never gonna make it lugging this thing with us . - That discussion is over , Billy . - What is the damn thing , anyway ? Come on , Jules , what is it ? - That information is not within the scope of this mission . - You don 't know what it is , do you ? Didn 't you see that shit in the vault room ? Fuckin ' a . - This goes into the flood channel right next to the green zone . - Right underneath . - It 's the best I can do , Jules . - Look , we just gotta put enough distance . - Enough for what ? - Milcore won 't go too far into the sprawl . It 's too dangerous . - We 're just gonna go out there with this ? - We don 't have a lot of options here . - Let 's go . - Jesus ! - Are you good ? - Yeah . Yeah . - I 'll take point , okay ? Come on . Once we get clear of this place , we 'll have the speed tribes to deal with . - We need a plan to contact the company . - Let 's get past the labor camps first . - Agreed . - This whole area 's a milcore industries enforced dead zone . - Come on , there 's gotta be pirate ips or something out here . - What are you gonna do ? Knock on someone 's door and say , " excuse me , " do you have illegal Internet access that I can use " to contact my corporate handlers ? " - That 's exactly what I 'll do , but with a smile . Right , Billy ? - Who 's that ? - Jules , what do you wanna do ? - Get ready to haul ass . Now . - Billy , don 't ! - What the fuck ? - They can 't know already ! Billy , what the hell are you doing ? - It 's not milcore . They wouldn 't risk hitting your prize . - Then who the hell is that ? - It 's the bridge crew . Corp cops running a side bet . They jump anybody who comes along until someone bigger drives them off . You have to live out here to know that shit . This shit is over . - Dammit , Billy , this is the mission . - Look , right now they 're flanking us , okay ? Not to turn us in , but to kill us and take that thing for themselves . It 's the sprawl way . It 's time to leave and run . Come on . - Bill ! - Flank him . That idiot is gonna get himself killed . They all are . - There 's more on the right ! - Move , come on . - There 's more on the bridge . Billy , over there ! - Where 's Kyle ? Natalie 's gone too . Oh . Oh , fuck . Decker , what are you doing ? We don 't have the rights for that . We don 't know what it 'll do . Damnit , Decker , I said stop ! - You alright ? You okay ? Jules ? You alright ? We gotta go , Jules . Look at me , come on . We gotta go . We gotta go right now , come on . Get up . Get up ! Let 's go . Grab that . - Billy . What are you doing , what about the mission ? - It 's over , nat . - They need help . - We can 't help them now . - What ? Where are you going ? - To get some help of our own . Just passin ' through . Clark . It 's mccray . Clark . It 's mccray , man , open up . Dammit . Clark ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , hey . - What are you doin ' here ? - Job went bad . - No , what are you doin ' out ? You 're supposed to be in prison . - I cut a deal , man . - Oh . A deal ? Who with ? - I need your help , Clark . - Answer me , Billy ! - Alright , alright . Pac sinclair . Alright ? A heavy out of the pacific rim consortium . - I know who they are . Why ? - I was rotting in prison , man . - You shoulda stayed there . You destroyed the entire network ! - Alright , alright . You know why you 're still here , Clark ? Because I didn 't talk . I didn 't bring down the network , man . Those assholes got nicked by themselves . You were gonna shoot me , Clark ? - Everyone 's gettin ' caught . Disappearing . And then you magically reappear talking about making deals with the company . I mean , what should I think ? - Look , man . Whatever beef you had with me , I paid for it . Alright ? Let 's start over . Yeah . - It 's bad out here , bill . We got drones all over the place . Cameras recording everything , man . You get a little paranoid , you know ? - Clark . This is Natalie . - Hey . - Hey . - Sorry about tackling you earlier . - So , what was the job ? - It was a time safe crack . Mark three same system I did at the solar plant three years ago . - Milcore again ? I thought I taught this kid better than that . What did you do wrong ? - Nothin ' . No . The lift went fine , man . It was after that that we ran into problems . - Wait , did you do the solar plant ? You guys did that ? Whoa . - So ya screwed up and now you 're in trouble with your new boss . - Yup . - You made all this ? - It gets better . I need you to get this thing out of my head . - Thing ? What thing ? - Just get far enough north , we 'll be past milcore 's reach . Hey . - I 'm okay . Which way ? - Just past the speedway . Should put us in the clear . Jules . Look at me . We have to move . We have to move now , come on . We have to go . Jules , we have to move . Now . Come on . - Come on , man , there 's gotta be somethin ' you can do . - I 'm not a surgeon , man . - How about disabling it so they can 't track us ? - It 's way beyond my tech . Why in the hell did you agree to this ? - It got me out . You don 't say no to a deal like that . - Money . - Come on , there 's got to be somethin ' . I was countin ' on you to get me out of this thing . - Wait , you planned this ? - I didn 't plan on the fuckin ' job goin ' south . Damnit ! I 'm not goin ' back in that fuckin ' hole . - What was that ? - What ? - Here , come here . - You 're picking up something ? - Yeah , right here . It 's scrambled , though . - Jesus , what the hell does that mean ? - It means you 're still broadcasting video signal from your right eye , man . That 's pretty sophisticated shit . - We 're sending them a homing beacon . Where the hell is pac sinclair ? - Pac sinclair should already be here . It must be a big problem on their end . Maybe somebody hacked their systems . - Somebody hacked pac sinclair ? That 's hard to believe . - Billy , anybody can be hacked . - Could you do a hack like that ? - Yeah . Well , no , I mean that encryption is military grade . And that 's way beyond my tech . - But you could detect it , right ? I mean , from a distance ? - Yeah , I think so . Yeah , I think so . I think so . - Hold on . - We don 't even know they 've been caught . If they 're still out there , we could find them . - I thought you said the job went bad . - It did . You just said pac sinclair got hacked , that 's big . - It 's a chance . - Alright , if pac sinclair got hacked , how long before they figure it out ? - I don 't know . But , when they do figure it out . Oh boy , they 'll be able to come right to ya . - Shit . - Ticky tock , ticky tock , ticky tock , ticky tock . - Okay , okay , okay , okay . How does this tracking thing work ? - Well , when in Rome , huh ? - I did it , I did it . I got it . Okay . Alright , I can track it , record it , bounce it , rebroadcast it . I can do just about anything with it right from this . Just won 't make phone calls anymore . Hello . Hello ? Yes , milcore ? He 's right here , Billy . Billy , it 's for you . Come on , come on . Alright , let 's see , let 's see . There we go . Now ... Okay , it looks like there 's more than one . - That 's them . I wonder if they still have the package . - Uh-oh , bad news . - What ? They 're right in the middle of gang central . - Well , at least we know milcore thugs didn 't get them . - They 're in deep shit , though . If we can get them out of there , we still have to contact pac sinclair . - Hey , Clark . Do you think we could use your illegal Internet service to contact our corporate handlers . - Uplinking to a company from out here , that 's pretty serious . I have mostly freeze dried stuff . This is just for the computers . - What kind of computers are those ? - The old kind . Hell , we have to go out and ... - I know you can rig an uplink . I 'll do the work , just tell me what to do . - Look , I ... I usually don 't go out in the sprawl anymore . Not much , you know . I can 't go out in the sprawl . - She 's good . I don 't , I don 't . - She 's good . She 's better than I was . - Oh , man . - Rough life . Workin ' in those green zone factories , huh ? Livin ' in those filthy labor camps , bustin ' your ass off for a few lousy fuckin ' food vouchers . And I 've had that food . Oh , man , let me tell ya . It tastes like shit . But , then you wouldn 't know anything about that , would you ? - We didn 't mean to enter this area . - I 'm kingseed , girl . This whole motherfuckin town is my area . - We just got lost . - Hell yeah ya got lost . You don 't burn a company , get that thing out of that place , to end up running down the alley like you stole a fuckin ' TV . - We were evading . - Evading , yes , yes . Corp cops , right ? Yeah , I know . I also know that there was an attack . At the green zone labor entrance tonight . News like that travels fast around here . Must be somethin ' big goin ' on . This . This looks very interesting , you know , because it looks like it came from the green zone . And , well , you don 't look like labor . You don 't talk like labor . You don 't steal like labor . Shit , you don 't even smell like labor . You 're the boss here , aren 't ya ? You care about your other guys , right ? So , let 's talk . Bring him in . - What is that ? - Fire it up . Okay , this guy right here . He 's ... He 's dressed like you . He 's clean like you . And he 's just not cooperating either . - No , no , no , no , no . - Well . Do you know what this thing is ? - No . - We 've been workin ' on this one . Why don 't you give your boy here a break , huh ? Come on . It 's only gonna get worse . Make it worse . - No , no , no ! - Hey , what 's this ? Clark ? - I don 't know . It 's interference . Something disrupting the signal . - Those sprawl boys are doing alright . They 've got gasoline for those rides . - Are you a gearhead ? - I 've boosted a few . - Excuse me , I don 't think kingseed would appreciate that . Okay ? - Kingseed ? - He 's the shot caller for the speed tribe . - Shit . - Who 's kingseed ? - He got started providing meth to the labor camps . Now he runs all types of things , you know , custom drugs , computers , guns , gasoline , whatever . If it 's banned , he sells it . In milcore they tolerate him because he keeps the labor campers happy . - They 'll be dead the minute he finds out they 're from a company . - The uplink spot is close . It 's over there , I think . - Okay , look , this place is a fortress . I 'm gonna keep an eye on things while you guys make the uplink , okay ? We 'll let pac sinclair deal with these assholes . Alright ? - Alright , okay , okay . Go . Go , go , go . - We don 't know , goddammit , we don 't know what it is . - You know what I think ? I think you 're bullshitting ' . And I think you 're gonna watch this man right here die . Unless you start tellin me what I wanna hear . - Kingseed . - You 're next . Zoom in . Is that guy with you ? Bring him in . - Alright , these stations , they feed the entire green zone . That fiber optic cable , it 's exposed right up there . - Jesus , can 't we just use a satellite uplink ? You have the hardware . - They 're always watching , Natalie , always . They 'll be on us in seconds . It 's just too risky . - We just Jack directly in ? - Yes . Full grid access and virtually untraceable . All you have to do is plug this shunt into the conduit and I can tap the line . - Should we abort the mission back on the rooftop ? - The deal was the money . - It wasn 't really about the money . I just wanted to score points with the company . Thought if I did well on this job I could get promoted . Become a full employee . - I was a company man once . I had that dream job . It didn 't last long , but i learned the system . I learned how they thought and that was key . I started hacking the big firms . Taught Billy how to break security systems , safe cracking . - You guys were in the big companies ? The heavies ? - Yeah , yeah . But , that 's when everything collapsed . Most of the guys were offed by company kill teams . They took Billy alive , interrogated him , god knows what else . Never thought I 'd see him again . - I didn 't even realize that shit was goin ' on out here . Just wanted to work my way up to somethin ' like Jules ' job . Maybe get some nice kicks out of it , you know ? - Here you go . - I 'll be damned , i can 't believe it . - Seed . - Kingseed . - You 've been busy while I was gone . - You were done , bro . We raised a drink for you , mccray . - You don 't listen to everything you hear . - You can 't keep a good man down , now can ya ? You know , I 'm happy to see you , my friend , I am , really . But all this right here . - You 're not gonna hurt my people , are you ? - Your people ? Hurtin ' ' em ? Of course I 'm not hurtin ' ' em . Okay , yes I am , but , you see , I 'm just trying to figure out what the hell they 're doin ' here . - My job went bad . We got split up , and here we are . - That 's right , that 's right , you 're a , what is it ? A shot-caller now , right ? - It 's just a crew . Just a crew . - You see , this is what the fuck I 'm talkin ' about . You 're the shot-caller . Come on , Billy boy . Chin up , baby . You used to enjoy this shit , remember ? - A little fuckin ' mercy , seed . We got work in the future , me and you . By the code , man , I 'll make it right . - By the code . By the code , huh ? By the code . By the code , you 're not even supposed to fuckin ' be here . By the fuckin ' code , burn that motherfucker . I tell you what . I 'm gonna go ahead and hold onto this . And you can have your crew back when I 'm done with ' em . - If we don 't deliver it , we 're dead , man . - Oh . This is mercy I 'm showin ' you , Billy boy . By the code . Unless of course you don 't want it . Okay , so now , why don 't you save your boy here and tell me about my new toy . - Please stop , please stop . - You 're wasting your time , he doesn 't know anything . - Pac sinclair . We work for pac sinclair , they sent us to steal it . - You work for a company ? You 're with a fuckin ' company ? - They 're just a client man . - You work for suits , you are a suit . You dare bring that shit into my house ? I 'm gonna kill each and every one of you motherfuckers and turn this fuckin junk over to milcore . - You know people in milcore ? You should know they won 't be giving out any reward . They 'll kill you and your men just for seeing the device . They will erase everything . - You 'll won 't get a good price without knowing what it is . - You won 't . Only milcore and pac sinclair know what 's in that thing . Milcore will just take it back , but pac sinclair will do anything to secure it . - She 's right . - You need us alive . - You help us , there will be a reward . I guarantee it . The corporation tolerates you , but they could take you out at any time . You 're no different than us . They are still in control . This is an opportunity to you to make an alliance with one of their competitors . Could open new doors , new opportunities right under milcore 's nose . - That 's a pretty good suit . You should keep her . What do you think ? Do these assholes know what that thing is ? - I don 't know , i don 't know , I don 't know . No , no , no , no ! Okay , okay . Decker . He knows about it . He can tell you . - Good boy . Good boy . See , I always knew you were the smart one here . Now , hold this motherfucker down so I can work him . - Leave him alone , he doesn 't know anything ! - Hold him , hold him , hold him . - Please don 't , I 'll show you . I 'll show you . - No bullshit . - No bullshit . - Decker , Decker don 't . - Look at this . You like power ? This . This is power . - I 'm sending the shot . - Okay , ready . Corp cops ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - Okay . Turn around . Come on , get up . Get up . Decker ! - Oh god . - Decker ! - Kyle ! Where are they ? - Looks like they took the device and ran . - Where 'd you get that ? - It 's a gift from a friend . Here . Take that too . Come on . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Hold on . Natalie , come in . Natalie , come in . Shit . What is Decker doing , Jules , what is that thing ? - I don 't know . I don 't know how he knows how to use it . We were never briefed on it . - Well , you were never briefed on it . - What 's the timeline with pac sinclair ? - I don 't know , i can 't get Natalie . - They 're gonna send an extraction team . We have to secure the device . - Natalie , come in . Natalie , come in . - Billy ? - Hey , I got Natalie . - Billy , are you there ? Billy , come in . - Natalie , I read you . Over . - Met some complications . I couldn 't talk . What the situation ? - Decker and Kyle have the device and are on the move . We 're trying to catch up . - What 's going on in there ? - I don 't know . Just get through to pac sinclair as soon as you can . - That 's not going so well . Almost got nicked by the corp cops . Don 't know what happened to Clark . - Alright , keep us advised . - Roger that . Out . - This job 's getting better all the time . Careful - Natalie ! Natalie ! - Clark , what the fuck happened to you ? - They used the satellite uplink as a decoy . We don 't have much time . - Billy said they don 't come out this far . - They don 't , not without a clear target . - Yeah , like someone tipped them off . - They could be . Something 's not right . Hurry . - I 'll have this hooked up in a second . - Hurry , hurry , hurry . - That 's it . - Okay , the link is good . How you gonna get down ? - Watch . - You have to hurry . - Shit , go back . Go back . - I think Natalie 's calling you . - Billy , come in . - Natalie . Natalie , do you read ? - Can you read me , Billy ? - Yeah , I copy . - We think we can contact pac sinclair . - Yeah , copy . How long ? - Like , 10 minutes . Copy that , and , nat , give us some options , eh ? - Roget that . Natalie out . - Quick , get off the road . They 'll be back soon . - Hey , Clark , you know how to steal a car ? - No . - You wanna learn ? - What the hell are you doing ? - We shouldn 't be taking that thing to pac sinclair . - That 's why we 're here . - No , we 've never taken anything like this before . It 's wrong , Billy , it 's wrong . - Half of the shit these guys build is wrong . We just have to finish . - They shouldn 't have that much power . You of all people should appreciate that . - Look , whether milcore has that thing or pac sinclair has it , it doesn 't matter . It 's out there . We just have to get our deal out of it , alright ? That 's all . Here . - Wanna help me with this door ? - I need to rest . - You can rest later . - We 're not even supposed to be out in this shit . This is big , Decker . This is bigger than you told me . That things worth billions . - Only if we make it out alive . - I don 't think i can do it , Decker . It 's too much . - Hey , look at me . Look at me . Look at me . Hey . You 're not doin ' this for me . Remember who you 're doin ' this for , right ? - Yeah . Okay . - Come on , buddy . Get up . - I can 't feel my hands . - Kyle , i need you over here . Please , come on , buddy . Alright . - What is it ? - Decker ! - Good , you made it . Anyone follow you ? - Hell , yes . The whole fuckin ' tribe 's on us . - Well , that 's great . - What happened back there . - Look , the device needs to be delivered . There 's no time . - Kyle , are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm okay . - Decker , how do you know how to use the device . - Look , I didn 't make the order , I 'm just following it . There 's no time with the tribes right on top of us . - I 'm ordering you to tell me . Now . - Take it up with pac sinclair . Kyle . - Decker , it 's alright , man . Natalie 's calling pac sinclair . - An extraction team will be here soon . - Yeah , and we 'll just hold up here and let the company deal with these assholes . - But we still need options . - Bullshit , man , we can hold ' em off right here . - It 's working . - Hurry , hurry . Because if it 's working , they 've already located us . - That 's it . - Leave it , leave it , leave it , leave it , come on . - Billy ? Billy , come in . Billy , come in . - Copy , Natalie , what do you got ? - Just sent the data package to pac sinclair . - She just sent the data pack . How long ? - Minutes . - Copy that , get close . Out . It 's done , all we gotta do it wait . - Come on , Decker . Speak of the devil . - Kyle , stop . - Keep working . - I said stop , goddammit . - Come on Decker , man . What the hell ? I 'm not gonna let you fuck this up for me . - Shit . - Decker . - I don 't know what this thing is , but I know it 's wrong . - Picked a hell of a time to get a conscience about it . - Decker . - Jules ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah , come on . Careful . - The device . It 's gone . - Jules , the implants didn 't glitch . Clark said they were hacked . - What ? - It 's Decker ! - No , no , no ! They 'll think we 're all in on it . - We 'll just tell them what happened , it 'll be alright . - Decker compromised all of us . They will kill every single one of us . We have to go . - I don 't get it . - Pac sinclair is jamming everything in the compound . - Something must 've gone wrong with the extraction . - Like I said , they bring big toys . The collateral damage can be significant . - Billy , come in . Come on , Billy , come in . I 'm going in . - No , no , no , no . You don 't wanna go in there . Hey , pretty good job hot wiring my ride here . I have to say , it 's fast too . You 're good . - Well , I wasn 't always a sophisticated corporate thief . - Natalie , come in . Natalie , come in . - I read you , I read you . - We are clear , need immediate pickup . Go ahead and telemark . - Alright , got it . - Okay , we 're on our way . - Wait , just go up here . When you see a dirt road , you 're gonna make a right . Right , now , once we 're out of the area we can establish another uplink no problem . - Hey , Clark . Thanks . - You know , I hate to say it , but , I 'm kind of enjoying myself . It 's been a while . - Natalie and Clark are gonna drive right to ' em . Come on . - Is that them ? - Hey ! - What 's up , Clark . - Decker , no ! - Come on , man , not Natalie . Come on , man . - One , two , three , four , five , breathe . Breathe . One , two , three , four five , breathe . - No . Oh , no . - Decker just shot him for no reason . He just shot him . What happened ? What happened ? - Decker took the device . - Pac sinclair came , they were supposed to take it . - We 've been compromised . - What does that mean ? - It means we 'll be erased the minute they track us down . - When Decker hijacked the mission , he compromised us all . Pac sinclair thinks we 're all in on it . Even if they recover it , we 'll be killed . Company policy . - Jules , you work for the company . I tell them where we were . - I 'm sorry , Billy . I 'm sorry about your friend . I 'm sorry about Decker . - What are we supposed to do now ? Billy ! Billy , come on . - I 'm not runnin ' . - Pac sinclair didn 't break the hack . - Not yet . - Decker didn 't even let him speak . He just said , " hello , Clark " and shot him . - Wait , he said that exactly ? Hello , Clark ? - Yeah . - Decker never met Clark . He didn 't know what he looked like . And I never mentioned his name . - Someone tipped off the corp cops when we were tapping the fiber optic cable . They knew right where to look for us . Our implants .

You 'll suffer a psychotic break soon . It won 't be pretty . - Pac sinclair is gonna come and level this place and kill us all . - Of that , i have no doubt . They have kill teams combing the sprawl for us as we speak . But my client is keeping them thoroughly occupied . In the meantime , I have the joy of holding down the fort until my crew arrives . Shit . - Natalie ! - Hey , boss . - What are you doing here ? - It 's no use , pac sinclair is gonna kill us all . - Maybe not . If we have this . - Leave it . - Billy .

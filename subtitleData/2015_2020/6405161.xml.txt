 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... We need to find Skye . HYDRA 's new heads , Strucker and List . They 're researching powered people . We 're making a deal . With Ward . We are working with Director Coulson . You 're gonna do whatever he says . I 'm more than happy to comply . I 'll have him taken away from here . Just let me go with him . I 'll talk to him . I 'll soften the blow . I see what 's happening . You were gonna dump me here like yesterday 's trash . - Skye ? - Coulson ! I need to get you out of here . No , not yet ! Don 't go ! Damn it , I had her ! Deathlok 's down , HYDRA 's storming the building . Your call , boss . Take me to your leader . What are you ... Were you watching me ? I didn 't mean to startle you . I heard you calling out . I was asleep . And dreaming . Do you wanna tell me about it ? Lincoln said you 'd been having nightmares . Lincoln ? He was actually in this dream . Being held somewhere . Being hurt . It felt real . Excuse me . Where 's my wife ? Ah ! Didn 't expect to see me back here so soon , did you , my love ? Not after such a well-planned banishing . Where 's Lincoln ? You took me from my home ! All right , that 's enough . Cal , this isn 't your home . I know that now ! Hey ! Lincoln is still out there ! Gordon , can you please ... What happened ? There was an attack . Can we please get back to what matters here ? You tried to take me away from our daughter . It 's unacceptable . Go calm down , Cal . You and I can discuss this later . There are worse options . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . But Coulson was there . It was HYDRA . I tried stopping them . I barely got away . They took Lincoln . Robert . It 's good to see you . Is it ? Okay , it 's good to see my bus . But , hey , you look well , too . Why turn yourself in now , Phil ? Strucker and List have been running experiments on Enhanced people . They 've set up a base in the Arctic . I have a man on the inside who fed us the location . I can 't trust you . Then trust the mission . Robert , don 't let this be about you and me . The one thing we still have , both of us , is stopping HYDRA . Don 't we ? What 's your proof ? First-hand . List took Mr. Peterson . Deathlok . The thing HYDRA created . Mike Peterson . An ally . He 's been working for me . This is not helping your case . We have a chance to hit HYDRA hard . They 're operating on powered people . We can shut that down and save lives . Perhaps . But I 'm gonna ask again . Why should I trust you ? Because we all have our secrets . You have one sitting in the cargo hold of your ship , but I 'm still willing to work with you . How do you know that ? Because it 's in this box . Which I will open for you , if you trust me . I don 't understand . Why was Lincoln there ? Because of me . I asked him to go and protect you . To keep you safe . It was a mistake . I should never have let you go at all . It was the right thing to do . We have to make sure that the Cal that we put out into the world is the same Cal that I 've seen here . The safe and user-friendly Cal . You were trying to make it easy on him . You were being compassionate . How do we get Lincoln back ? We don 't . It 's too much of a risk . You ... You don 't understand . They will torture him . They will kill him . I know exactly what HYDRA is capable of doing . I 've carried the memory of what they did for decades . I 'm sorry . And I wish I could save Lincoln from that , but I suspect somehow HYDRA 's tracking Gordon 's movements . Anyone I send will be at risk , too . And Lincoln wouldn 't want me to . These people are important to him . He wouldn 't want them to risk their lives . We can 't rescue Lincoln . Not now . I 'm sorry . What the hell ? Welcome back . Who 's there ? We didn 't get to formally meet . My name 's Mike . I think we got knocked out together . You 're the guy with the parts . You know where we are ? No . At least they haven 't killed us yet . But there are bodies out there . Oh , great . You 've got all that hardware . Use one of those weapons and get us out of here . Right . Because I didn 't think of that . At least your sarcasm still works . They disabled the arm . It 's dead . What about that teleporting guy ? He coming to help us out ? I hope not . I think they 're tracking him . He 'd put all my people at risk . Yeah . My people are just as outmatched . Only they 're stupid enough to try it . So if we want out of here , we gotta do it ourselves . I 'm Lincoln . Thank you , Doctor . Hail HYDRA . Well , Strucker 's most pleased with our progress . And he 's very anxious to see the subjects with his own eyes . They are an interesting contrast , these two . This one , the one they call Deathlok , his modifications are mechanical . Bestowed by science . By man . And the other ? His oddities are intrinsic . Somehow bestowed upon him by nature . Yes . But knowing the difference is not the same thing as recreating it . And to that end , I hope to ... To isolate the genetic component , yes . A comparison between the two could be invaluable . Doctor Whitehall believed discovery requires experimentation . I do miss him . As do I. But the world moves on , and we form new allegiances . I 'm very glad to hear that . Especially as we proceed with the experimentation . Here we go . That 's your plan ? I take it from your expression you 're not dazzled . Why send a small infiltration unit ? Why not a full-on assault ? Blow the base to particles . I 'd rather not sacrifice the prisoners . Rescue is ideal . We don 't even know how many people HYDRA 's holding . I 'm not sure I 'm willing to put my people at risk . You don 't have to . I 've already got my own people picked out . Don 't touch that . What do you mean ? I 'm telling you ... It 's a ... How 're you feeling ? Nauseous . Mmm . - You want me to get bandages ... - Oh , no . Man , not from getting shot , that 's nothing . It 's a rare crash ... It 's those two . Simple . I think they actually like each other . Just , um , focus on your wound . It will be less unsettling . Yeah . You want to take the stick ? I could teach you . Come on . I think you 'd like to fly . No . No , if I fly , I 'm taking us to Mykonos . Or Kauai . So you don 't like our plan ? Grant , S.H.I.E.L.D. makes me nervous . Didn 't you already fulfill your promise to Coulson ? But not my promise to you . There 's still one more thing I need from him before this is over . Yeah . Green light . Go . Agent May . Sir , welcome back . Nice to be back . You 'll be accompanied by guards at all times . Each of whom will shoot you without hesitation . Remember that . May 's actually pretty friendly once you get to know her . Gentlemen . You finally come back , and you bring Grant Ward onto the base ? I hope this plan of yours works . You and me both . This video feed was streamed from Deathlok 's eye less than an hour ago . What happened ? It appears HYDRA removed his eye . Well , we 've got a problem . Without Deathlok 's feed , we don 't have eyes on the ground . Not true . I have a man working on the inside . Sunil Bakshi . I know Bakshi . He 's a HYDRA agent . Not anymore . Now he works for me . Says the HYDRA agent . My days with HYDRA are over . Just an independent contractor trying to make amends . We remain skeptical . With good cause . But I believe using Bakshi is the only way for us to successfully infiltrate this base . The base is in the Arctic Circle , with nothing around for miles . HYDRA will see us coming . Which is why it 's critical I take in a small team . Just to be clear , Agent Coulson , what is your objective here ? We rescue the Enhanced prisoners , then disable the missile defense systems so that S.H.I.E.L.D. jets can fly in safely to bomb the facility . You really believe a small team can do this ? My team can . Then I suppose we should put this matter to a vote . Agent Morse ? I 'm in . Agents Weaver and Oliver ? No . Too risky . I agree . Understood , but I 'm voting to go ahead with this . That leaves you with the deciding vote , Agent May . I 'd like a word in private with Agent Coulson first . You look upset . Is everything okay ? I feel sorry for her . Yeah , well , you should 've seen her back on the plane with Ward . It seems the two of them are in love with each other . Whatever that is , it 's not love . No , of course not . Hey , thank you for packing the sandwich before I left . - It was really delicious . - Oh . You 're quite welcome . But I just don 't understand why Coulson would take Ward on a mission . It 's simply too dangerous . Yeah , for Ward , maybe . I attacked him back on the Quinjet . Hunter had to pull me off him , so ... Really ? Yeah . Yeah . Lucky for him . You know , what I should 've done is toss him from the plane . Yeah , that would have been fitting . But perhaps there 's a better way still . Splinter bombs . Simply find Ward alone . Stick one of these on and poof ! No more Ward . Yeah , that probably would be quite a fitting way for , um ... Wait ... You 're serious . Ward is a threat to every agent working in S.H.I.E.L.D. Isn 't it our responsibility to at least arm ourselves against him ? What the hell are you thinking ? I could ask you the same thing . Since when did you become a high-ranking member of Team Gonzales ? Someone had to run the base while you were gone . Having a seat allowed me to keep you safe . I was fine on my own . Seems that 's how you operate best . What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? That you 've been lying to me ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. fell . All those overseas trips you were taking . They were never about recruiting new agents , were they ? You wanna tell me what Theta Protocol is ? - No . - Because you don 't trust me . Because you 're not the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Neither are you . Not anymore . We 've always had our secrets , May . You had a secret line to Fury behind my back . This is personal . This is about Andrew ? He 's my ex-husband , and you were working with him behind my back . I went to him for counseling . He was the only therapist I could talk to about my alien writing impulses . You should 've told me . You 're right , I should have , and I will apologize to you later . At length . But right now , List has Mike Peterson , and who knows how many other Enhanced prisoners . Now can we put this behind us and go rescue them ? Please ? What part of " no " didn 't you understand ? The part where you won 't take me to Lincoln . I told you . No one enters or leaves Afterlife until we know it 's safe . It 'll be too late by then . S.H.I.E.L.D. may be wrong about a lot of things , but they never leave a man behind . I 'm sorry . Don 't give up hope just yet . Skye can save Lincoln . I saw her do it . What ? You 've seen it ? We think Raina 's Gift may allow her to see things before they happen . I thought her Gift was spinning really fast to collect gold rings . Tell me what you saw . Maybe she 's right . What I saw doesn 't make much sense . Why would Coulson be working with Ward ? Coulson and Ward were together back at Cal 's office . But I didn 't tell anyone . You have to go . You do go . Go where ? Lincoln 's in a dark room with two doctors . They 're cutting into him . You find him . You 're the only one who can save him . You have to take me . I promised Jiaying I wouldn 't use my Gift . You need permission to save a friend ? Last time I went back for Lincoln , HYDRA almost captured me . How will this be any different ? Because where you take Skye is a long way from HYDRA . You 're taking this too far . It 's the only way we can move forward . I 'll go help my team , while you stay here and reconnect with your past . That made sense when it was just calling my mom . This is something else entirely . Listen , you 're a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent , Kara . I was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . A long time ago , before HYDRA took me . Before I met you . Being a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent was taken from you . This is your chance to get that part of yourself back . And I 'll keep saying it until you believe me . All you have to do is stay strong . If you didn 't want me to go , then why 'd you vote to allow it ? Because Coulson 's only using his own people . Figured it was worth the risk . Those are S.H.I.E.L.D. agents going on that mission , Robert . I 'm aware of that , Agent Morse . But we 're fighting a war with an enemy that is without honor . Sometimes we make sacrifices for the greater good . Excuse me , sir , but I 'd like to join the mission . I appreciate the offer , Agent Simmons , but this is a specialized team . Agent May is there for tactical support , Fitz to disable the defense systems ... And who 's there to look after Mike 's injuries ? Ward ? HYDRA 's already removed Mike 's eye . God knows what else they 've done to him . He 'll need a doctor , and preferably one already familiar with Deathlok 's anatomical structure . You sure about this ? Absolutely . This is something I have to do . Suit up . - What was that ? - On your knees . Now ! May , it wasn 't me . Then what the hell was it ? - Skye . - Hey , guys . This is great . We finally got the team back together . How are they all ? Are you making friends ? Yeah , how did you get the intel about the base ? Can you control your powers ? Yes . Yes . I promise I will tell you guys everything . It 's a lot . You might not believe me . But , just , not now . Well , we 're just happy to see you , and you 're being so secretive . No , I 'm happy to see you , too . But ... Yeah , we 've got a mission to do , not much time . Blah , blah , blah . No , Ward is here . I don 't wanna talk about anything personal in case he 's just ... I hear my name ? He 's like Candyman . We should review the op . - Ward ... - Mmm-hmm . I can 't believe I 'm saying this , bring us up to speed on Bakshi 's intel . All right . Bakshi 's using old HYDRA text channels to provide us with intel , although much ... Much of it is , uh ... Much ... All right . Can we just address the elephant on the plane ? I know . This is weird . Mistakes were made ... By you . And people got hurt . By you . And I could stand here and explain again how my parents and brother left me vulnerable ... We all had our traumas , Ward . Didn 't turn any of us into psychopaths . Well , we all have our own ways of coping , don 't we ? For example , I was yours . - Watch it , Ward . - Look , I 'm just saying we all made mistakes . Coulson handed me over to my abuser , thank you . Skye shot me . After you killed how many people ? Yeah , and we were a team , and a family , and you betrayed us . I know , that 's what I regret the most . Not the lying , not the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents I had to put down , and I 'm sorry , not even dropping you two in the ocean . It 's this . My actions destroyed this . I 'll regret that forever . 'Cause there were good times , right ? Before ? I mean , for a while there , we were a good team , weren 't we ? - I 'm still happy I shot you . - Yeah , me , too . - Should have aimed for the face . - Yeah . Guys , I know this is so weird , but we have to come back to the mission . Two teams , Skye , Ward , and Simmons on rescue and medical . Fitz and I will break into missile defense and gather intel . May 's with us for firepower . Wait , you 're not on rescue ? Let me handle the job assignments . The point is , there 's a lot of challenges ahead . We don 't wanna implode before we even get there . And , Ward , just no more talking to people . You 've been pacing , haven 't you ? Why would you assume ... Come with me . I shouldn 't have come back so hot . I didn 't count to 10 . I am better . I promise . I 'm sorry . It wasn 't right to send you away . Certainly not without telling you , probably not at all . I understand . Actually , no , I don 't . I don 't understand . Why did you send me away ? Everything is so dangerous right now , I felt I had to . I ... And you had that thing you get . Butterflies in the stomach , except , in the heart . You were stressed . Why don 't you stay for now ? We can let everything calm down , and then we can figure it out . Thank you . Thank you . You know , I was pacing a little , I don 't wanna lie . It 's okay . It really will be the three of us together . Just like we wanted . There are always threats . What can you tell me about her ? Raina ? She 's manipulative , dangerous , deceitful . We had good times . You need to watch her . What are you doing ? Not everyone 's gonna be able to see the mission in real time in Coulson 's ... In the office . So I figured the rest could watch here . If you don 't want my help ... No , no , no , it 's cool . Thanks . I 'm sorry , man . For everything . And I did what I thought was right , I mean , I still do , but I never meant for you to get hurt . I get it . It 's the line of work . You had a tough call to make I maybe wish you 'd chained me up somewhere not a men 's restroom , but ... I swear , I mean , I looked for any other place which ... The point is , Mack , I forgive you . Really ? Thanks . But I promise you , when everything settles down around here , next round of drinks is on me . A round of drinks ? Really ? Mmm . You choked me out and kidnapped me , a round of drinks is the first thing in a long , long , long list of things you 're gonna do for me . Okay . All right . - All right ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? - Whatever it takes . You talk to Bobbi yet ? No , not yet . It 's funny , I don 't mind blood . But needles ? Not a fan . I 'm trying not to look at any of it . But this isn 't really about tests , right ? This is you guys keeping an eye on me where I can 't leave . Better than a cell , I guess . Plus , we wanna make sure they didn 't mess with you physically . Just ... Messed with my head . I know . How much do you remember ? From before ? Pieces . Missing some details . You know , you and I actually met a few times . So I 'm here for you . If you start remembering , come to me . I 'll help you out . Thank you . You 're the first one here to speak to me like a person . What Whitehall did to you , it 's unthinkable . Yeah . But at least one good thing came out of it . I met Grant . No , just wait . He 'll get Bakshi to help . You 'll see the Grant I do . I doubt they 'll survive . It 's a crushing disappointment , really . No one has made it past this stage of our experiments with alien enhancement . Well , no one other than the Twins , of course . And Strucker has them in Sokovia . Oh , it would be so nice if they were not our only viable subjects . Well , perhaps he will prove the answer . He 's due in surgery about now . Doctor List , a cloaked plane is on approach . Cloaked ? But how can you see it ? It 's the barren location . We see a blip , even a cloaked one . It must be S.H.I.E.L.D. Shoot them out of the sky . Yes , sir . We 've been spotted . It 's time . I 've got visuals on the target . Buckle in . They 've locked on ! Satellite confirms that S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 has been hit . Any contact from Coulson 's team ? I 'm afraid not . Sit tight . This was always the plan . I 'm starting to think this wasn 't a very good plan . Is there anything you can do about the drop ? Not if we want HYDRA to believe we 're debris . Really starting to wish I hadn 't eaten that Hot Pocket earlier . Hold on ! S.H.I.E.L.D. 218 has eased its descent and is making preparations to land . That was the easy part . Clear . I was being followed . Calm your mind , Bakshi . Your compliance will be rewarded . It 's good to see you again , sir . Where 's Kara ? Exactly where she needs to be . Is List still here ? Yes , sir . In the lab . Along with the other prisoners . And the Mainframe Room ? Down the hall , to the left . Everyone clear on their team 's objective ? If it 's agreeable , I 'd prefer to join Agent Ward 's team . - Is that gonna be a problem ? - Hardly . Remember , just 15 minutes till Gonzales ' jets arrive . Move . Be careful , Jemma . - Dr. List ! - Get me out of here . Just like old times , huh ? Not exactly . So that 's what happened in Puerto Rico . The least you could do is thank me . How about I just don 't try to kill you again ? It 's not as bad as it looks . Really ? Nah , it 's pretty bad . There was another guy in here . He had electrical powers . - Lincoln ? - Yeah . They moved him just before you showed . You need to hurry . The guy 's in pretty bad shape . We 're coming in . You 're up . Don 't just stand there like an idiot . Go and find something we can carry him out on . Surprised you 'd sign up for any mission with Ward involved . I saw an opportunity to do the right thing , so I took it . Lincoln . Lincoln , wake up . Raina was right . Sir , look out ! We 're on the same team . What were you thinking ? That I made you a promise . What ? That you would kill me ? I thought we moved past that . Go on . Get it over with , you monster . You really have changed , Simmons . I 'm disappointed in you . Okay , missile defenses are almost down . Good . Where 's Coulson ? S.H.I.E.L.D. jets are five minutes from the target . Have them await my command . Any word from Coulson 's team ? Not yet . Get out of there , Phil . - Hey , we need to move . - Just one minute . Come on , Phil . This wasn 't the plan . Or was it ? Either come with me now , or you 're next . Okay . After you . Is he okay ? Where are Ward and Bakshi ? They 're not coming with us . Okay , come on , we don 't have much time . This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 218 . We have the prisoners and are leaving HYDRA airspace . - Yes . - All right . Well done , Coulson . Agent Weaver , have ourjets fire when ready . Be careful ! Hello ? Sounds like you made it out okay . I 'm surprised you didn 't join us . Thought it might be in my best interest to find an exit that wouldn 't , oh , land me in a cell afterwards . Or , you know , my brain erased . Well , I 'm glad you made it out all right . Yeah , we both know that 's not true , Coulson . You wanna tell me what this call 's really about ? I always knew the team wasn 't going to forgive me . Some people just don 't deserve forgiveness . But Kara , she does . That 's why I 've returned her to S.H.I.E.L.D. Ward , there 's ... She was a good agent . A good person . Then HYDRA ambushed her safe house and took that from her . Took everything . Whitehall broke her , and I 've tried to fix her , but I 'm just not the right man for it . There 's not enough good left inside me . She deserves better . I 'll see what I can do . I know you 'll do the right thing . HYDRA didn 't just disconnect your leg . It 's like ... They dismantled it . It 'll take serious man-hours to reattach it . I wish I had the equipment to fix it here . Just tell me someone does . There 's a facility . We 've already gotten in touch , so they 'll be ready for you straight away . How 'd you guys find us , anyway ? Bakshi , if you can believe it . Ward got him to lead us right in . Yeah ? I didn 't see Bakshi . What happened to him ? He didn 't make it . Come on , Lincoln . Wake up . Sir , the attack team 's on their way back . They report the entire HYDRA base has been destroyed . Good . There was no sign of this Doctor List . He may have escaped . Sir ? Are you ... Are you okay ? She 's still dangerous . We 're all dangerous . But it 's okay . She 's in our custody and we got what we wanted . What we wanted ? Enhanced people . Here on the base . That 's why you were willing to go along with Coulson 's plan . You wanted the Enhanced people he 'd rescue . I didn 't expect Skye , but we have her and one of her friends . Maybe we can learn how many are out there . You 're gonna hold Skye here . Of course I am . Okay , I think that we need to discuss this . Discuss what ? What are we discussing now ? Time to honor our agreement . Here you go . Unlocked and all yours . Go nuts . At least , until Fury shows up and asks for it back . Oh . Spoiler alert . Oh . Hey , I have to take this . Hi . Can you hang on a second ? I bet Gonzales wasn 't happy when you said he wasn 't invited to this chat . Yeah , well , I wasn 't too happy when he blew a hole in my base and kicked me out . We all live with disappointment . And right now , we have bigger problems . Does that mean you found it ? I figured you 'd visit me again . I spoke to Gordon . I think we should discuss your visions . Specifically , I 'd like to discuss how you used them to convince Skye to run off and rescue Lincoln . I didn 't convince Skye . I just told her what was gonna happen . It was dangerous , and it was foolish . And it won 't happen again . From now on , any decisions based on your Gift will be made by me . It 's funny . I was just thinking , who decided you should have final say in all the decisions around here ? Raina ... I 'm just saying , maybe the time has come for someone else to ... I 'm guessing HYDRA doesn 't know Loki 's scepter was the weapon that killed me , but I bet they know it can control minds . In their hands , that 's catastrophic . Coulson , please tell me you know where it is . Sokovia . I 'm pretty sure List is headed there right now . Raina ? Raina , talk to me . I see a scepter . Beautiful , dangerous ... It isn 't finished yet . So much destruction . I 've just sent you everything I found on Strucker 's location . Coulson , why didn 't you just tell Gonzales why you really wanted to get onto the HYDRA base ? Believe it or not , he puts every decision to a vote . I know . And I was pretty sure if I 'd been honest , I would 've lost the swing vote . So I did what I had to do . Last thing . Theta Protocol . Is it ready ? Yes , it is . Time to bring in the Avengers . It 's terrible . Jiaying , it was ... What ? What was it ? Consequences are upon us . Men made of metal will tear our cities apart . And the world will be changed forever .

 on Stitchers ... This is gonna be her first real relationship . Right . I got it . if you can . hold on . Ayo : Her oxytocin levels are rising in response to what she 's seeing in the stitch . Things are heating up . the more it 's gonna mess with your ability to stitch . you 're handling this stitch ? He 's got the yips . He 's worried about you . I have a history of watching people I care about get into bad situations or worse . Then maybe we shouldn 't be together . Do you know how hard it is for Kirsten to keep seeing her mother like that ? And where exactly does Kirsten see Jacqueline Stinger cooped up ? How could you betray me ? I just ... Can we please talk ? Listen to me ! Just ... but I don 't know how to fix this . Me neither . Cameron . I feel so ... Cameron ? Camille ? is that gas ? Can anyone hear me ? Where the hell is everybody ? Cameron . Cameron ? Cameron ? Cameron ? Cameron ! Cameron ? God . please help ! ♪ Take me inside ♪ ♪ Take me inside ♪ Cameron ! Cameron ! God . Cameron ? wake up . this is only a little bit personal . good . Kirsten . What ? Where is everyone ? I don 't know . I bounced from the stitch and everyone was gone . What is that smell ? maybe . What 's the last thing you remember ? I don 't ... I was prepping for a stitch and then ... I ... my face . Did ... I feel like someone slugged me . Is my cheek red ? no . It 's fine . Okay . we need to search the lab . Yep . it was like this when I bounced . I 'ts like everyone but the two of us vanished into thin air . What 's with the monitors ? too . this place is a ghost town . Look . Ow ! That 's really hot . - Whatever happened ... - We just missed it . even our corpse is missing . Do you remember who he or she was ? uh ... She was ... I can 't remember . Is this a side effect of being gassed ? but it 's got organized attack written all over it . We got to call this in . Line 's dead . let me have your phone . You 've reached Camille . Leave me a message . send a text like a normal person . bye ! this is Kirsten and Cameron . Call us as soon as you get this . We 're worried about you . and who would actually be able to do it ? Blair . Ivy might even be involved . you asked . okay . Just ... just chill . we just got to stay calm and work out this problem . okay ? - Okay . Right . so maybe it has something to do with the case we 're working on ? I just can 't remember what that case is . Let 's find out . - This can 't be right . - What ? our last case was Jake Rowland . Jake Row ... The murdered gamer ? so whoever came in and attacked us wiped the current case off the system ? Wait . Listen . Listen ? To what ? I don 't hear anything . - I ... - Shh ! Who 's there ? I didn 't ... I didn 't hear anybody . if there 's one thing it 's that we 're the only ones here . Let 's go back to my house . Maybe Camille 's there . Maggie ... Camille ? Ow . It 's really hot . maybe she left in a hurry . Or somebody just grabbed her . hey . We 're figure this out . Okay ? Please don 't touch me . Not right now . we could both use some comforting . I 'm gonna check out Camille 's room . Maybe she left a clue . Can you try the NSA again ? Camille ? Did you get through to the NSA ? more or less . they are aware of the situation . are we in danger ? - That 's where it gets weird . They told us not to worry and to stay put because ... " Mother " is looking out for us . I have no idea what that means . It could be code for Maggie or whoever picks our cases or ... - My mother . - There 's still no way to be sure . did you find anything in Camille 's room ? She has blackout curtains on her window there 's a lot I can 't remember today . but ... and I 'm ... I 'm not sure I want to right now . I understand . That 's ... then it makes sense to stay put together . You sure ? your pantry is also a foodie 's worst nightmare . I know . It was Camille 's night to get groceries . Has anything come back to you from before you woke up in the lab ? Nothing . Whatever gas they used really did a number on me . Do you remember anything ? I have no idea what could be so important as to make an entire lab full of people disappear . I keep thinking about what the NSA said . What if this is about my mother ? Wouldn 't we remember that ? but that 's that the thing . I don 't remember anything . It 's not even just a blur . It 's just not there . until we hear from " Mother . You don 't talk about your mother much . Why is that ? What do you wanna know ? What was she like growing up ? um ... She was difficult to read . the strain . but I just wouldn 't know what to say so I was frustrated a lot of the time . how did you deal with it ? I just worked through those frustrations in other ways . thought experiments . Any problem that I could figure out the solution to . But that didn 't last long . and they were crazy about each other . Bill and I ... we didn 't get along . break up . I had no idea . it 's totally fine . it feels good to get that off my chest . Thank you for listening . Thanks for talking to me . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean it . the better . Right . I don 't want to confuse things . I should go to sleep . use her room . Wherever she is . score . Wake me if she gets home tonight ? Ha . If the sound of Camille kicking my ass out of her own bed I will . Good night . Night . Cameron ! - What is it ? - Someone is watching us . Ok . I just checked the porch . out back ... I didn 't see anyone . I saw a woman standing right outside the window . and she ... Wait . Do you think the NSA sent someone to watch us ? Was that ... " Mother " ? I think this is the latest in a series of aftereffects from the knockout gas . You just need some rest . and I just saw someone peeping on us from outside . and come at this with a clear head in the morning . Okay ? Okay . Okay . Wait . could ... could you sleep in my room tonight ? Like on the floor ? - Are you awake ? - Hmm ? Barely . What 's up ? I can 't stop thinking about us . it seems like we should know everything there is to know I 'm not so sure about that . Speak for yourself . I think I know you pretty well . yeah ? What 's my favorite movie ? Mmm . Trick question . You don 't have one . good night . what sport did I play ? And why did I quit ? Basketball . Ed Clark wanted you to try out because he thought you didn 't quit . Until they kicked you off the team . Which was ridiculous because I was the best player . but if the best player on the team suffers from temporal dysplasia you tend to get a lot of shot clock violations . I 'm really goin ' to sleep now . because I was too embarrassed to tell anyone how I did it . Which bone did I break ? please . gosh . This little piggy . You got so excited when you heard you sprinted towards the door and stubbed it on a chair . I never told you that . How did you know that ? Cameron ? Cameron ? Cameron ? - Oh ! - Ooh ! sorry . You okay ? I just ... and I ... I thought maybe ... You miss me ? I take it Camille didn 't come home ? I haven 't been able to get hold of anyone . - Nothing from the NSA ? - Nada . but I can 't sit on my hands much longer . Hello ? it doesn 't look like anyone 's been here since we left . And whose is that ? Is that the same coffee cup that was here yesterday ? No . It 's still hot . Someone made this recently . we 're being mucked with and I don 't like being mucked . This doesn 't make any sense . What was that ? Hold on . What the hell ? What 's " Euro " ? I have no idea . - Wait . - What ? There 's something in the static . - What is that ? - It looks like a face ? There 's another one . Is there any way to bring the image out of the static ? yeah . I think I have an idea . I can rig something up . Great . How long will it take ? I 'll be done in 10 . I 'll look around the lab and see if there 's anything else that 's ... been moved around or changed . Cameron ? I found something ! Cameron ? Cameron ? huh ? For a Deadmau5 show . Deadmau5 wishes he were this cool . question for you . Why couldn 't we make out those images on the monitor ? and there was a static blizzard over them ? that 's when they were under our boring old white lights . If we hit them with the right color light we can make all those hidden images pop and send all that unwanted noise to the background . - Man of science . - Well ... - I don 't see anything . - A moment . Kirsten : Sad . Happy . Surprised . - Confused ... - These are for people with autism to understand emotions . I used to have flash cards just like this when I was a little girl with temporal dysplasia . Interesting . And they would be on our monitors because ... ? Maybe " Mother " is trying to send a message to us . What are you doing ? but it 's a different color . And the mucking continues . What is that doing in your hand ? What was this doing in your locker ? You think I had something to do with all of this ? I don 't know anything . What is a key doing in a coffee cup ? What is a face doing hidden in static on these monitors ? but I 've been by your side this whole time . You know me ! Hold this . Where are you going ? To finish the puzzle ? Should I get your stitch suit ? We 're all adults here . Puzzle piece ? So what does it mean ? - Why you askin ' me ? - You 're the kid that grew up doing puzzles and thought experiments . What does it mean ? Challenge accepted . You gotta see this . Are you 12 years old ? you perv . Oh . Goodkin . too . - 5-9-1-5 . - Gelson Street . Maybe the answer to all of this is there . But what if it 's a trap ? too . No one cars outside . No one inside the house . what are we supposed to find ? I know that everything today but I really can 't see anything in here worth investigating . I can think of one thing . One seriously badass vintage thing . Oh my gosh . it 's not a Hot Wheel . sizes and prices . and I mean obsessed with this car when I was a kid . But my mom always said it was too dangerous . So ... Hmm . You 're a car guy . Another Cameron factoid I did not know . but I bet this thing still purrs like a Manx and roars like a lion . what I wouldn 't give to have a night on the town with her . to all of that . it 's too bad we don 't have a key . I think we do . Hmm ? it says " Ford . It 's so old the engraving 's been rubbed down . and just keep embracing how seriously awesome this is . thank you . what are you doing ? - Safety first . We 're not taking this car out for a spin . Huh ? there must be a reason why . and see if we can figure it out . okay . Huh . that would be odd . There 's no registration or insurance . Maybe it 's inoperable . So much for that theory . Why won 't it shut off ? It 's just got a faulty ignition switch . Try again . We need to get the garage door open . Okay . It 's locked . Front door . Let 's try this one . let me try . Let me try . What the hell ? - It 's locked from the outside . Damn it ! something that we can break down this door with ! Right . this box is just full of puzzles . I 'm getting nauseous . let me try . Let me try . I got it . I need your help . Cameron ? you all right ? Cameron ! I just wanna sleep . - No ! You can do this . You can do this . you can do this . I know you . You can do this . Okay ? Come on . Come on . ready ? Go ! come on . - One . - Two . That is not how I thought my first time in classic car - would go . - How are you feeling ? I 'm a little better now that I 've had some fresh air . I feel kind of the same way as I did when I woke up in the lab . That could be something . What do you think ? I think that our lungs are full of fumes from a car and it 's been even longer since I showered . Mm . why don 't you go shower . I 'll make us some food . Any requests ? Surprise me ! Oh my gosh ! Kirsten ... Cameron ! That is not what I meant by " Surprise me " ! they haven 't changed things between us . What are you talkin ' about ? I 'm still not ready for us to be together . can I tell you what I came here to tell you ? You know how we thought the garage was a dead end ? We were wrong . but not this one . - So you 've lost your touch ? - Hardly . if you know what patterns to look for . nine squares on each . is by deliberately switching one of the squares . Which is exactly what 's been done to this cube . It 's an unsolvable Rubik 's cube . yet another in a long stream of puzzles . I really wish someone would just tell us what 's going on . honestly ? Working out these clues with you over the last two days hasn 't been the worst time of my life . of course ? but ... I just feel like it 's been a while that 's all . it has been . I 've missed it . that 's it . - What ? What 's it ? - What if somebody 's deliberately just us ? we 'd have to get over our baggage and be a more effective team . So you think this is some sort of Tony Robbins-meets-Jigsaw operation put on by the NSA ? not the NSA . Can we actually get dinner to go ? Uh ... Looks like we were paid another visit from the Clue Fairy . Now he 's just messing with us . Or she . No . He . and who wants us to keep stitching ? My father . The NSA told us that " Mother " is looking out for us . I really think that 's our lead . was " Mother " looking out for us when we got trapped and nearly died in the garage ? We don 't even know if she exists or if she 's just some NSA stalling technique . and this has his fingerprints all over it . this is not about Stinger . How can you be so sure ? You were the only one left when I bounced . Why weren 't you taken ? What are you talking about ? Are you and Maggie and the NSA doing this to get me to trust you again ? Work with you ? Forgive you ? you 're being ridiculous ! Why ? Because you say so ? Why should I trust you ? Because you know me . Do I ? This was a mistake . What ? it just ... it just never works out . what are you talking about ? You 're one of the most outgoing people I know . You 've never had problems connecting with anyone . - Wait . - Huh ? like ... like they 're clues or something ? we can ... I 'll help . Actually ... I just think we 'd do better working alone . Sure . Okay . Another clue ? Great . Okay . What is the last case we worked on ? Jake Rowland . Tell me something I don 't know . What is the current case we 're working on ? - Tom Dewitt . - Tom De-who ? Tom Dewitt . found dead in his garage . Suicide . Car exhaust inhalation . He was also an empath . His brain was wired in a way that meant he could feel the depth of other people 's emotional states . I 'm confused . A new case came in ? No . Not a new case . Tom is our current case . but I didn 't have a chance to check for myself until now . so now you 're calling me a liar . No . I 'm saying that ... You 're not real . maybe it 's time we call it ? no . You don 't understand . I 'm stitched into Tom right now . You 're right . I don 't understand because that is metaphysically impossible . how have we spent the last two days traveling back and forth across the city ? though ? it feels like we talk about going somewhere we 're just ... there . Like jumping between different memories in a stitch . Do you remember actually traveling to the places we 've been ? of course I do . - Really ? and what was on the radio in the car ? because it didn 't actually happen ! How could Tom have this memory ? of a secret NSA facility ? we must 've opened up a pathway into his empath abilities . I 'm experiencing them through a filter of ... my emotional state . Nothing that 's happened in the past two days has been real . Including me . Including you . You 're a reflection of my feelings about us . So I 'm your imaginary friend . no . You 're more like my projected friend . Wait here . Cameron ? - Now take this . - What ? No ! Take it ! - Cameron . - Now shoot me . Cameron . Stop it . What are you so worried about ? If I 'm a figment of your imagination ... but ... - Do it . Pull the trigger . - No ! - Am I real or not ? - Stop ! - Am I real or not ? You 're not real ! But that doesn 't mean that I could watch something happen to even my projected version of you . I care about you . I can 't stand the thought of losing you and it being my fault . I guess that means you love me . Cameron ! God ! Cameron ? Talk to me . no ! Oh my God . Oh . oh my God ! it 's a stitch ! I 'm in a stitch ! Cameron ! I know I 'm stitched into Tom Dewitt ! Can you hear me ? I don 't know how I 've been in here for so long . But I ... I ... I think that something about . Tom 's autistic brain pattern so ... because I ... I can 't hear you . And I 'm ... And I 'm ... all alone in here . Tom . Cameron ... I 'm gonna make the bounce . Jake . Coco Soo ? Jamie B ? but I ... I can 't do it alone . Kirsten . Ed . Tom needs you . But I don 't understand how his mind works . his ... empathy . you can 't give up . Not now . Tom is the most ... silent of us all . Nine squares . Nine monitors . Cameron ... I 'm not bouncing yet . I think I 've figured it out . The images on each monitor are all part of one big puzzle . they might tell me something . then all the conversations we had weren 't really between us . Tom 's memories are clearly mixing with my emotional state . must 've been coming from Tom . Which means that the story you told me about your mom and her boyfriend Bill ... it happened to Tom . the way you didn 't wanna be touched how you felt like you had trouble all of that was a part of the way that Tom experienced life as an autistic man . And the puzzles . to feel like he had control . Oh ! Heat sensitivity ... too . So " Mother " must 've been Tom 's mother . He knew that she would always look after him . But who killed Tom ? Let 's see if I 'm right . Maybe I was wrong . Is that an eye ? Maybe it 's a face . Cameron ? I think it 's a face ! I know that face . I know that face ! Cameron : Kirsten ! Fisher : Is she okay ? what happened ? but I solved it ! you did it . What did I do ? You finally broke Kirsten . Okay . Bill Kurland killed Tom Dewitt . Tom 's mother 's boyfriend ? That 's the one . LAPD already questioned Kurland . He was at work at the time of death . and ... and started the engine to his old car . Are you sure Tom didn 't start the car himself ? so that nothing like this would ever happen . And Tom had a heat sensitivity . no matter what . Why didn 't he just leave the car or the garage ? Because he was obsessed with puzzles . Bill gave him a Rubik 's cube that had been tampered with so that he 'd be so focused he 'd asphyxiate without screaming or calling out . Bill locked the door from the outside . but why ? Because he was in love with Tom 's mom . But she was so devoted to Tom that it was destroying their relationship . Bill thought that he was freeing his mother from the burden . ma 'am . Tom . together . Thank you for talkin ' to me . Are you okay ? Yeah . I ... You must 've been so worried about me that whole time . I was in the stitch for days . You weren 't afraid I wasn 't gonna bounce ? you were only in there for three seconds . I guess that was all the time I needed . For what ? For this .

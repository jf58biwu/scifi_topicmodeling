 Red Dwarf - Season 11 Episode 01 - TWENTICA In memory of J.H.S. SAS MBE - Now there was a lad . Gentlemen , crack open a fresh pack of rubber pantaloons - we have a problem . We 're picking up a ship heading straight for us in an unmapped region of deep space . Where ? Here in " Region Uncharted Sector No-Name " quadrant " Nameless " . Message incoming ! I 'm seeking J.M.C. Second Technician Arnold Judas Rimmer . Keep it zipped . Say nothing . Sound-wise we 're going commando , people . That 's him there ! I cracked , sorry guys . I tried to stay strong but he broke me ! Second Technician Rimmer , I understand you have a crewman who falls under your jurisdiction , a David Lister . Right there , Bud ! Sorry guys . He broke me again ! Wh-what do you expect ? ! I 'm not made of concrete ! I am Combat Droid 4 , of Batch 27 . We wish to conduct a transaction of goods with you . But you 're simulants - you despise humans . Why would you want to trade with us ? You have something we want , and we have something you want . What ? A hostage , taken from a human transport ship . Allow me to show you . We cannot negotiate with simulants . We cannot cave in to their insane demands . Under no circumstances are J.M.C. personnel permitted to negotiate with the enemy . Guys , it 's me ! They 've taken me hostage ! You 've gotta help me ! Of course , that 's what the J.M.C. think , but who the hell listens to those pen pushers ? Here are our demands , One second , we need a moment . What 's going on here ? Is that me ? ! ? How can it be me ? I 'm here ! There are a number of options , Sir . All involving you , and all extremely bad . I 'm all ears ! Perhaps that person we saw , is a different version of Mr. Rimmer - from an alternative dimension . So if he dies , not the end of the world . Or , perhaps he 's a clone of Mr. Rimmer , produced , somehow , from his D.N.A. Again , if he dies , not the end of the world . Or perhaps that man is you , Sir - A " you " seized from the future , and taken back into the past . Again , if he dies - not the end of the world ! We 've no choice . We 're gonna have to negotiate . But we never negotiate with the enemy . Until today . Well , if that 's the way they 're going to roll , let me handle negotiations . You think I 'm going to leave the life of a possible " future me " in your hands ? ! I 've seen movies , Rimmer . I know how to talk to hostage-takers . I 've done J.M.C. crisis negotiation , Lister . I 'm handling this , now get me a pad and open coms ! Okay , Arn . We 're working on the pad . But in return , I 'm going to need something from you . Wait a minute . Are you just using your " hostage " negotiation techniques on me ? Just get me a damned pad ! Okay , Arnold - we 're working on the pad , but you 've got to realize , I can 't pull a pad out of my ass in five minutes - I 've gotta talk to my boss , they 've gotta talk to their boss - they 've gotta talk to the D.A. Here are my demands : In return for the whiny human hologram man , You will give us the casket of Kronos , which you salvaged from our abandoned attack ship , the A.S. Anatos . The casket of what ? ! What 's that ? It contains the essence of 23 of 27 . I remember this - it 's upstairs in the rec-room underneath the pool table . For safe-keeping ? Nah - to keep the table level . Go and get it ! Oh , man ! Now the pool table is going to be all bend and wibbly again ! You have the casket of Kronos ? How do we know you won 't betray us ? I am 4 of 27 . I am a warrior , and high-born . Who do you think I am ? 3 of 63 ? 3 of 63 ? You 're nothing like him . Then ... We trade . Now , what about the hostage ? Wait ! I 'm being taken hostage ! I 'm back ! Thank God ! I was their hostage ! I didn 't think you were ever going to save me ! I was kinda hoping we weren 't ! You were gone two seconds ! Two seconds for you , but for me , it was hours . I over-heard what they were saying . That Kronos casket didn 't contain the spirit of anyone . It was an amplifier they needed to plug into their temporal transporter to expand the beam . What ? ! ? They 're Expenoids . What the hell are Expenoids ? ! Droids capable of doubling their transistor power every two years . They progressed so rapidly , they became a threat to every living entity in the universe . What are they planing ? To travel back into the past to change the present . That 's a bit old-hat , isn 't it ? How many times have we seen that before ? Expenoids are unemotional , cold-hearted psychopaths . They will have no hesitation using hackneyed old cliches - if it suits their purpose . If they 've come back into the past to screw around with human evolution , How come I 'm still here ? Maybe you didn 't qualify ! Look at the scanner . They 're accelerating ! Preparing to time-jump ! We need to get after them , stop whatever they 're doing , and get that Kronos machine back . So we can utilize it 's time-travel abilities ourselves ? No . So we can prop the pool table back up ! We haven 't a second to lose - If we hurry , we can time-surf on their slipstream . Planet up ahead . I 'm detecting some kind of electron wavelet , ... approaching at speed ! We 've lost navigation ! And steering ! And monitors ! And meeeeeeee ... I think what he was about to say was we 're both ... . All the electrics are down ! What the hell 's happening ? ! ? We 're crashing ! That 's what the hell 's happening ! Now brakes ! ? ! Do you think this is a good time to make a crack about my teeth ? Brakes ! Kryten couldn 't be more fried if he was a Mars bar living in Scotland . Rimmer is out too . Every cloud ... ! What the hell happened ? ! ? We got hit by some sort of electro-magnetic pulse weapon . It 's taken out the grid , and drained everything connected to it . We need to rebuild , using the auxiliary drives ! Jumpy 's attached ! I always forget which one is pos and which one is negative . Don 't get them mixed up , Bud . Or you 'll wind up with nipples that look like two barbecued-flavored nicknacks . Here goes nothing ... . Okay . Start her up . Sir ! What happened ? ! ? Kryten , stand up and walk up and down really fast to recharge your dynamo . Get going ! And don 't stop ' til you 're fully charged . Close hatches ! So embarrassing . What happened ? ! I think we got hit by one of those P.M.T. ' s ! And where are the Expenoids ? There 's no sign of their ship and there 's no sign of them . Krytes - any theories ? Well , according to the monitor , they too landed here . But due to the curvature of space-time , several years have elapsed in the time it took us to get here . We 've gotta find them , and get that Kronos machine ! Well , the vibrations in the light that goes through here , tells us there 's some kind of township not far from here . Are we there yet ? Not far now , Sirs . Real people ? ! I 'm going to be seeing real people again ! Gas street lighting . Steam-powered right-hand driving motor vehicles . Technology-wise , this time period doesn 't correlate with anything in my data base . Any theories , Krytes ? None at this juncture , Sir . Why do you always ask him if he 's got any theories ? I 'm acting , standing , commanding , senior , premier officer - why do you never ask me ? Maybe I 've got a theory - Maybe I 've got a really great theory , But you 're always too busy asking him to find out how great my theory really is . Okay . Any theories , Rimmer ? No ! It 's the principal . Look at that . Closed for violations of the Prohibition Act . Prohibition ? That was the 1920s ! Yeah . And alcohol was banned and the bootleggers took over . Dark days . Society run by a bunch of hoodlum gangsters . Dark days , indeed ! I was thinking more about the booze ban . Whatever they 're prohibiting around there ain 't booze . Look at that ! Well , if it 's not booze they prohibit , what is it ? According to this leaflet , the year is 1952 ! Nearly two decades after prohibition ended ! Well lookee here ! Illegal contraband . If that 's the penalty for toast , what the hell do you get for pizza ? ! It 's not the toast that 's illegal , Sir . It 's the technology . That 's why the electro wavelet shook down Starbug . Any technology beyond the 1920s is illegal around here . Unless , of course , you 're an Expenoid . The Expenoids haven 't traveled into the past to change the present , They traveled into the past to enslave humanity ! By doing what ? By traveling into a point in history , where we haven 't got the technology to defeat them - or defend ourselves . And they plan for it to stay that way . Hence the tech ban . A tech ban , which means you Sir , are illegal . He is ? ! I may move here - lay down roots and start a family ! He 's not the only one who is illegal . So am I ! You know the penalty . Looks like they 're gonna shoot them . Hey ! Is he dead ? He 's moaning . Can you blame him ? He 's just been shot ! Did you see what happened ? Yeah . We saw . We 'll get you a doctor . It 's too late . I ain 't gonna make it . Here . Pizza delivery ? You want a pizza now ? Oh , wrong pocket . The Lady Be Good Club . Here , ask for Harmony de Gauthier , and give her this ... What is it ? It appears to be some kind of machine part , Sir . We 've gotta get to this Lady Be Good club . Dressed like this ? ! We 've gotta get some clothes ! Have you done this before ? It was the only way to get home sometimes . When I lost all my money playing Texas Hold ' em . I know it was wrong . I was young . I was stupid . But what do you really know when you 're seven ? Stealing cars at the age of seven ? Why didn 't you take the bus ? Hot wire a bus ? I was seven ! Just wasn 't up to it ! Catching the bus - what 's wrong with catching the bus home from school ? Who mentioned school ? I was off shoplifting . Don 't look at me like that . Been on the straight and narrow since I was nine . Ten . All right . Eleven . This must be it . There 's no buzzer . Tech Cap . Allow me , Sirs . I am well-versed in the ancient human signaling technique , that was all the rage before electro-magnetism was discovered , and the electric buzzer took off . Now , if memory serves ... . We 're out . I 'll handle this . American 's love the English accent , so that rules out Lister . They 're particularly impressed by people who say " whom " a lot . I bid you good evening , stout fellow . My companions whom stand before you , require information about a personage to whom I understand frequents your establishment and who goes by the name Harmony de Gauthier . Are whom acquainted with said lady ? You been drinkin ' the giggle water ? If you ain 't members , beat it . Listen buddy , You know you got standing out here - not so cold you could serve him up in a martini cocktail - Lucky - no middle name - Listerano ! Ain 't you got no lugs ? I said " blow " . Wait ... Listerano ? He ain 't related to the scientist Joseph Lister , is he ? Uncle Joe ? Of course I am . Straight down the stairs - first to the left . What is this place ? It appears to be some sort of elicit science club , a place where bootleg professors and astrophysicists get together to create illegal tech and discuss outlawed scientific theories . You boys want company ? We 're looking for a Harmony de Gauthier . Hey Harm - there 's a bunny here wants to get acquainted . So , uh , you want to grab a drink first or you wanna go somewhere quiet to discuss relativity ? For an extra $ 10 , I 'll do both - general and special . No , that 's - that 's not why I 'm here . You into electrons ? Is that what pings your microwave ? you want to watch me do the double-slit test ? and experience the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics ? What ? No ! Every guy likes particles that turn into waves , right ? Or maybe you 're more in the mood for some Copenhagen interpretation ? You know what I " m talking about ; where sub-atomic events are only perceptible as in-deterministic physically discontinuous transitions between discrete stationary states ? No - we 're not here to do science with you , okay ? I 'll wear a tweed suit and sensible shoes if that revs up your engine . We 're here for something else . Hey , I don 't do the Big Bang ! That 's Beryl . And if you 're looking for unified field theory , I ain 't your gal . Look , we 've been sent here to deliver some gizmo . We got told you might help . This is the capacitor . If the cops get their mitts on this , we 're deader than Galileo 's theory of tides . So who are you ? Just some guys from the future looking to help . So what does that thing do ? It fits into this . But how , I don 't know . It 's not my area . You were just keeping it safe . Exactly . No one goes up there . So what does this thing do ? It infiltrates the electron wavelet and redirects it . Creates an E.M.P. to destroy the Expenoids . You got it . Any clue how they go together ? We 're all theoretical . And all the scientists still active have been driven underground - Nobody 's exactly rah-rah about getting sent to " Old Steamy . " So there 's no scientists around who can put this thing together ? Just the bums and palookas who fell apart when they couldn 't practice science . Where are they ? They spend all day drinking themselves goofy . Einstein , Hubble , and Edison ... but you only get phonus bolognus out of those screwballs . They 're spiflicating - morning , noon , and night . Did you say Einstein .. as in Albert Einstein ? Sure . He 's half-goofy now - screaming at people who aren 't there . Walking around the park pushing a pram full of string . He 's got some theory about it , but no one will listen . Pram theory ? Einstein 's one of the most brilliant minds that ever lived . He can do anything . You think I 'm just off the boat ? Well , where will we find him ? At this time ? Probably on the corner of Hope Street with the other blueys . Hey man , is that your pram ? Yes ! Sir , allow me to introduce myself ... Who the hell are you ? ! Acting senior officer Arnold Rimmer from the mining ship Red Dwarf . I have to say at school , I always loved the bit of science . Bunsen burners - brilliant ! Dropping sodium into water - all that fizzing marvelous ! Oh , and congratulations on ... what was it again ? The Theory of Relativity , Sir . The Theory of Relativity . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Of course ! Of course . In this world , he hasn 't achieved anything . So how can he help us ? He 'll still be a genius . Whatever problem we give him , he 'll be able to solve . Come on - let 's get Hiney the Winey back to the Lady Be Good . This way , Sir . My pram . My pram . You leave the string alone , yes ? Don 't take my string . You leave my string alone , see ? It will be fine , Sir . It 's very safe . My string ... We won 't touch your string . My string . It 's your string . You mind getting him a steak with string fries or something ? Now here 's the problem . We gotta get this into this somehow . How ? You think I know ? I don 't know . Yes you do . And do you know why ? Because you 're a genius . You can do this . I can do this ? We realize electrics isn 't strictly Einstein 's field , but we thought he was so incredibly brilliant , he 'd be able to figure it out ! You ain 't going to get nothin out of this gutter muncher . Oh , why not ? 'Cause this bird ain 't Einstein ! What - so he 's just some old bum who pushes around a pram full of string ? ! You 've got it . We haven 't been introduced . I am Bob the Bum . So , you want to know if I can get this potato into this potato ? I 'll get right onto it . I didn 't realize I was so brilliant ! Cops ! Coming down the alley ! It 's a raid ! Find something to do ! Don 't look suspicious ! It doesn 't go there ... How about there ? I can do this ! I 'm brilliant ! Okay ! Everybody pipe down . Quiet ! This is a raid . Hey , drinkin ' and dancin ain 't illegal - what 's the beef ? Harmony de Gauthier ... now that 's one fancy stage name , But you ain 't foolin ' no one , Professor Baldwin ! That 's who you are , ain 't it ? A dirty no good scientist who 'll discuss theoretical physics with anyone so long as the funding 's right ! I 'm outta the science game now , see ? I ain 't touched a Petri dish in months . How dense do you think I am ? You really wanna know ? Just divide your mass by your volume . Hey ! What the hell happened to your face ? Who ? Me ? I went bobbing for apples in a cement mixer . Sure you did . So what do ya do ? I just play in the band , Mam . Oooh , and what about you ? Are YOU a scientist ? Think a scientist can tap dance like that ? ! Wait a minute ! How come you 're drinkin ' out of a Erlenmeyer flask ? Dey been doin ' science ! You 're busted ! We nailed a couple of white coats , Boss . We think they know something about this screwy contraption machine the Resistance bunnies been working on to whack you guys . So , we meet again . You really don 't mind the hackneyed old cliche , do ya ? You know we 're really not so different , you and I. Now you 're taking this , Mech . What is it you want ? Human beings , in the distant future , realized that humanity wasn 't mature enough to handle modern technology , and so we were created to prevent that version of the future from ever happening . We are the good guys here . But you kill people ! No one said that we couldn 't have a little fun along the way . So what happens to us ? Are you going to kill us , too ? I wasn 't planning to , but you know - that 's a really good idea . You 're gonna kill us in cold blood ? ! Actually human blood isn 't cold . It 's around 37.5 degrees centigrade . Prepare to die , human scum . You said you were a high-born ! A droid of distinction ! A real big spender ! So much better than that other droid - .. what was his name ? 3 of 63 . Did someone say my name ? Ah ! So you 're 3 of 63 ? What of it ? Nothing . Just don 't say anything . We 're good now . He was slagging you off behind your back ! What ? ! ? Look , just leave it , 3 of 63 . It 's not worth it . No , no - you were slagging me off behind my back ? ! ? Look , you remember we were going through that bad patch ? You 're no better than 18 of 241 . Two potato makes one potato ! He did it ! Bob ! You are brilliant ! Just like you said ! We don 't have much time ! This place will be swarming with Expenoids in no time ! If I can hook this to the transmitter , we can send the signal world-wide and wipe out all the mechs . Whoa-whoa-what about Kryten ? ! We have to detonate it , there 's no choice . No ! Lister , don 't you see ? Once the Expenoids are gone , you can stay here . We 'll no longer be trapped together . I can 't lose Kryten ! Listen to me , Sir . Mr. Rimmer is speaking only about what is best for you ! As obviously , detonating a global E.M.P. will destroy him , too ! Hang on ! It 's gonna take me out , too ? ! ? Anything electrical . My straighteners ? ! ? Hand over the E.M.P. I already detonated it while you two were yackin ' . You got 15 minutes to scram . LEG IT ! We 're 5 minutes from orbit . Activating the Kronos machine . Sir , we 're going to hit some turb at 3700 feet . Any chance we can go a shorter route ? Not according to Pythagoras . Yeah , well Pythagoras wasn 't much of a pilot . Leave this to me . I learned a few things today , Kryten . Huhm , really Sir ? What about ? Well it seems to me that us humans better be on our toes - make sure we don 't lose ourselves , and let technology take over . Mmm . I 'll make a note , Sir , and remind you if you ever appear to be in danger . Arms ? Yeah . Yeah , you do that . Shoe ? Other shoe . Sockie . Other sockie . Don 't rely on machines , Kryten . Or else we 'll lose the very thing that makes us human . Open . Ahh . That 's the lad .

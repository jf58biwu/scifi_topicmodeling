I 'm so glad you could join us . ma 'am . I 'm not your mother . You can call me Helen . Kids ? Mother . these are for you . they 're beautiful . Thank you . this is Thomas and Amy and Jennifer . guys . Sieg heil . Sieg heil . You forgot our fourth again . This is Max . buddy . I always wanted a dog . Max is very much part of the family . It 's what VA Day 's all about . Joe . Joe . I 'll show you around . - Hey . - Hey . I tried not to wake you . I didn 't know if you got much sleep . you know . How was the memorial ? It was fake . You look nice . Thanks . We should spend some time together . I don 't want to make you late for the dojo . How about dinner ? Yeah . Was that the phone before ? Yeah . It was the wrong number . I 'll see you later . right ? don 't knock it . So your dad doesn 't mind you being in here ? He trusts us to be responsible . Joe . Dad collects them . He likes to hunt . I guess that 's security cover . Come on . I 'll show you outside . - Want to play catch ? - Sure . So how 'd you get to be working with my dad ? He decided to give me a shot . I guess . Where 'd you go to college ? I went straight to work . In the SS ? In a factory . But you were in the Hitler Youth . Sure . Right up until they kicked me out . You want to join the SS ? There are so many things I 'd like to do . Places I 'd like to go . But sure . I want to make my country proud . right ? What 's this ? Joe . You never told me your middle name was di Maggio . sir . once . It 's a lazy sport compared to track or soccer . I 've got to pick up Helen 's mother from the airport . Okay . this is where you offer to ride along with me . Help draw some of her fire . Right . Sorry . come on . Throw it here . Joe . Konnichiwa . I 'm Juliana Crain . Kotomichi . Only speak to the Trade Minister when he speaks to you . Miss Crain . I am Trade Minister Tagomi . The Trade Department has many Aryan visitors . Often they feel more comfortable if they are greeted by an agreeable white face . the easier it is to do business . and smile politely at all times . You 're giving me a job ? isn 't it ? Yes . I got the details from Mr Eto . There is an opening here Miss Crain . Hai . Arigato . Mr Tagomi expects complete loyalty and discretion . and you will not leave this level without my express permission . patrolled by armed soldiers . Do not go anywhere without prior authorization . You contacted the Trade Minister 's office ? sir . They 're expecting you . Inspector ? Inconclusive . The man and boy who described the bespectacled gunman in the crowd believe this resembles the weapon they saw . Compile a list of antique dealers with a permit to sell firearms . I 'm glad I caught you . I 'm kind of late for work . yeah . I just finished . Night shift . yeah ? I just thought I 'd stop in on the way home . she came by yesterday . I never did say I 'm sorry for ... What happened . Arnold . Anne already passed on your regards . So what is it really ? Juliana ? Frank . she only stayed for five minutes . Her mind was clearly somewhere else . but I- - Well maybe Juliana doesn 't need us to worry about her as much as we think she does . we 're- - whether people need us to or not . and we make the hard decisions if we have to . You 're a good guy . I 'm glad Jules can count on you . you know ? Okay . I 'm going to go . I 'll see you later . There she is ! sir ? - For Helen . They canceled her mother 's flight . I think the rest of us will get over it pretty quickly . Rudolph ? Rudolph Wegener . John . Sieg heil . Sieg heil . What are you doing here ? Trying to leave . Connecting flights to Berlin have been delayed for hours . Now they 're saying it could be some time tonight . So where you been ? On assignment in the Pacific States . I was already marooned there due to the security situation . Any word on the Crown Prince ? They 're saying he survived . The Führer will be relieved . It 's a day to count blessings . my mother-in-law 's flight has also been affected . We have a spare seat at our table . I- - why not ? How long since we saw each other ? - Nonetheless- - - 15 years ? It 's VA Day . I insist . being bullied by Scharführer Smith . What do you say ? Thank you . I 'm sorry . This is Joe Blake . Rudolph Wegener . close friend . sir . Rudolph . Likewise . Let 's get you fed . given the scope of his automotive operation and the importance to the economy . But before we wade too deeply into the somewhat choppy waters how is the Crown Prince ? Ambassador . please excuse me for forgetting to congratulate you on VA Day . Minister Tagomi . Particularly since the Pacific States choose to not formally mark the occasion . We celebrate our shared victory fully on Army Navy Day . that His Highness the Crown Prince will lead those celebrations in Tokyo . I saw him first thing this morning . He looked remarkably well . Trade Minister ? How is it progressing ? Oberführer . If you will all turn to page 2 of the Trade Security 's discussion document . Rudolph ? Yes . Except for the politics . Whispers about the future of the Reich and its leadership grow louder by the day . I 'm afraid . my friend . Perhaps . The thirst for power brings out the worst in some of our comrades . What about here ? Heydrich reports that you continue to keep order with effortless efficiency . Rudolph . There are those with short memories who seek to drag us all backward . I thought insurgency had all but been eradicated . Those with strong hearts and soft heads have not . Ask Joe . He spent most of last week tracking the Resistance in a covert mission in the Neutral Zone . Joe ? I learned a lot . You 're lucky . You couldn 't hope for a finer mentor than John . Helen ? I bring an old friend from the Fatherland . You remember Rudolph . Please stop using the word " old " when you introduce me . I believe we met a few times in Cincinnati . I never forget a beautiful woman . It 's good to see you again . but I did manage to stop off and pick up a formidable Riesling . then you can stay . Thank you . and lunch is almost ready . Okay . Hello . Mrs Kasoura ? Yes ? Konnichiwa . It 's Mr Childan . From American Artistic Handcrafts ? Yes ? how are you ? thank you . you had asked me to advise you of any new pieces when do you think you might be able to visit the shop ? I 'm not sure . I will need to check with my husband . Of course . Certainly . I just- - I- - I would hate for you to miss out . And ... I 'll call you back . Chief Inspector Kido . You have a special permit to sell firearms . I would like to see your sales ledger now . Of course . Certainly . Have you sold any late 19th century revolvers Mr Childan ? sir . It is not an area of specialization for me . I normally deal with pre-19th century armaments . .45 caliber bullets times 3 . Sold three days ago . Do you recall this transaction ? of course . Mr Satoshi Matsuda . Satoshi Matsuda ? He is Japanese ? as the law demands . many of them placed . Which gun would these bullets fit ? it 's not my area of expertise . Easy to check . And the address . Matsuda resides in Tibet ? I believe . you have been to Tibet . sir . quite remote . You are granted a special license on condition that the authorities are able to reach people who buy prohibited items easily . uh- - whereas who I trust ... That is of every consequence . You understand ? sir . Hai . Very much so . Rudolph . He stole a boat ? I did not steal a boat . and I took another boat that- - which looked very similar . A hovercraft would have looked similar after all we had drunk . And I can 't have one glass of wine on VA Day ? under the strict understanding that this goes no further after today . No . - Want a drink ? - No . Helen . To the most important job in the Reich . Joe . find as many bad ones as possible . Rudolph ? I noticed your ring . but we spend a lot of time apart . I try and see my children as much as possible . You remember Catherine . I trust . No . What ? I assumed that 's why you lived on an island . You spent as much time on the Ohio river as you did on dry land . I--I- - I stopped right about the time I left Cincinnati . I hope you all saved room for apple pie . Yeah ? does the phrase " To life " means anything to you ? No . Why ? Frank . Mr Wyndam-Matson ? so they need to be right . Requested ? Why ? It 's not a question either of us should be asking . Everything correct ? Yeah . Good . Joe ? Someone special ? careful . no . there is a ... but it 's ... It 's complicated . nothing worth having comes easy . you wouldn 't have given us much of a chance . We had nothing . We had less than nothing . but then the Crash . John believes that a man determines his own worth . Looks like you 've done pretty well . Joe . I see a lot of John in you . uh ... It 's been really great being here . uh- - It 's been really great . it 's a long way back to the city . Why don 't you stay over ? no . I wouldn 't want to put you to any trouble . we have room . It 's up to you . It 's coming ! It must be nearly time . Come on . What was the Pacific States assignment ? Trade . Can 't talk about it ? my friend . It just doesn 't warrant discussion . Routine . especially when we have senior people there . Obergruppenführer ? Yes . Miss Crain . Your security pass is ready for collection from personnel . where Mr Eto interviewed you . Be back in exactly 15 minutes . I stand before you today a proud man . two years after the capitulation the bloody struggle to liberate America was finally and comprehensibly won . Sakura Iwazaru . And on this day our true quest began to make a proud but demoralized people- - maybe ? Pretzels ? Yeah . I 'll go . ... in the history of humankind . labor movements masquerading as being for the people . It was a land of decadent- - you okay ? Excuse me . Can I help you ? What ? Yes . I 'm here to collect my security pass . ... shoulder to shoulder - in a thousand-year Reich- - - Thank you . ... of strength and splendor . One national community truly united in eternity . You were looking for Mr Eto ? maybe you can help . What 's your name ? Christine Tanaka . You do remember me ? Right ? From yesterday ? someone who works here . The Trade Minister sent you to get an employee file ? Yeah . but one of the girls said I should ask since I was down here . I think it 's kind of urgent . the person I 'm looking for is Iwazaru- - Sakura Iwazaru . You 're sure about that ? Why ? What school did you go to ? You don 't know the Three Monkeys proverb ? See no evil . Hear no evil . Speak no evil . And Sakura ? Cherry blossom . It 's a pretty common name . Who asked you to get it ? I can call- - that 's fine . Don 't . No need . Sounds like they 're playing a trick on the new girl . maybe . Back to work . Rudolph Wegener . A senior Nazi from Berlin . he vanished from his hotel room . Inspector . You had no suspicion ? Of what ? The high-ranking Nazi insinuated his way a visit during which His Highness was shot . He was on the same podium . Minister . only suspicion . Do you have any idea how or why Colonel Wegener fled from his hotel ? I 'm sure that there 's an innocent explanation . Yesterday you issued a diplomatic visa . I did . May I ask who to ? but I believe all you need to know is that it wasn 't Mr Baynes or your Colonel Wegener . I will need you to share everything you have on this man with my office . of course . Trade Minister . ... drinking nothing but Polish vodka . Have you ever had Polish vodka ? It 's not good . son . I think this occasion calls for gentlemen . Rudolph . What are people doing there today ? Business as usual . They don 't celebrate VA Day . Really ? I thought the Führer made them honorary Aryans . Joe . not a means to an end . Joe . Not least their work ethic . There 's no shortage of Rudolph . I simply agree with the Führer . Continued peaceful relations with Tokyo is in everybody 's interest . John . Surely you agree that we must do whatever it takes to avoid war . Perhaps . Some wars are necessary . We fought in one . And you still believe that everything we did back then was necessary ? Joe . The scale of- - Joe ? Nobody talks about the camps . Nobody talks about how many we exterminated . We got commendations for it . But nobody talks about it . Rudolph ? It was necessary work . We did it . sacrifices have to be made . John ? I prefer to look forward . - That 's not what I asked . - Rudy . This is beneath you . alone but for a bottle- - I was trying to find some perspective . And yet you no longer sail . Why is that ? at least now we have better whiskey . Now we have a better world . Sieg heil . Sieg heil . Sieg heil . Mr Tagomi would like to talk with you privately . Mr Frink . What do you want ? I was visited by the Kempeitai today . They have a particular interest in antique firearms and ammunition . I don 't need to know what you did with those bullets- - I didn 't do anything . Mr Frink . Do not make the mistake of underestimating me . and I 'm busy right now . So please leave . I simply need your assurance that they won 't be found . the only way this gets back to me is through you . okay ? I warn you I will not die as the result of gaijin stupidity . you fucking Nip-loving prick ! and we both die . And believe me . You 've got a lot more to lose than me right now . We seem to have no choice Mr Frink . I won 't keep you long . I merely want to thank you for your diligence today . The cultures we were born into mean that we do things differently . And yet I suspect that we also hold many of the same things in the highest esteem . You 've seen we don 't have many white faces here . It will be assumed by your appointment that you can be depended upon . Trust ... Miss Crain . Mr Tagomi . reading an opponent 's intentions through physical response . kept touching his throat when he spoke . I do the same thing sometimes when I 'm trying to hide something . Aikido is a noble pursuit . Miss Crain . I 'm sorry . Frank . I 'm so sorry . I got held up . This looks beautiful . I called your mother to see if you were there . then I called the dojo . Frank- - don 't say sorry again . I didn 't want to put you in more danger . Frank . I 'm not giving up on this . no . Frank . the guy who pulled you off that street all busted up . It 's not about them . it 's .. it 's ... it 's about you . That is not true . And why even mention the accident ? How can you still not see what you 've done ? You know ? You know what ? I- - Juliana . I was happy . How happy ? I was happy . We were only ever as happy as they allowed us to be . what if there 's- - what if it 's true ? Frank ? what- - for everyone ? too ? Frank . - Come on ! - Fine . Fine . I am not that guy who found you on the street anymore . Where in the fuck have you been ? Juliana ? I got a job . What ? At the Nippon . You 're working for the government ? - For Trudy . - They killed Trudy . they took my sister ... my nephew ... And now you . Frank ! I can 't unsee that film any more than I can unkill that man in Canon City . What did you say ? You killed someone ? - Okay . - Who ? There was a- - a Nazi agent who- - who tried to kill me . someone- - someone from the East Coast Resistance helped me . East Coast Resistance ? A man ? Frank . What difference- - Frank ? Was he a fucking man ? Get the fuck away from me . Frank . Frank ! Frank . sir ? Helen tells me you 're staying the night . Is that okay ? Yeah . tell me . What do you make of Rudolph ? He seems like a good man . Why ? He 's lying . There was no trade assignment in the Pacific States . He was identified on a diplomatic ticket . Gave a false name . Rudolph 's flight wasn 't delayed . He was . So you 've known all day ? Yeah . What about Helen 's mother ? Dead two years . She was a great lady . I felt certain that he would confide in me at some point today . Maybe I don 't know people as well as I think . So Helen knew about Rudolph . You must trust the woman in your life Joe . the less he 'd suspect . Are you going to question him ? we ... We performed duties together that ... bond men . They bond men forever . I have no objectivity here . My heart tells me he 's a good man . He 's a ... He 's a brave man who ... Who must have good reason for ... Betraying his people . But my head ? shoot him in the fucking face . Joe ? He 's lied all day in my home . Enjoyed my family 's hospitality . You tell me . I 'm asking for your counsel . What would you do ? my taxi . Thank you . Good night . Joe ... A real pleasure . Rudolph . I wish we hadn 't left it so long . John . Joe . Emotions can 't be allowed to interfere with what is right . And sacrifices have to be made . What the hell are you doing ? The meeting room on the trade floor is called Bara- - Rose . - Right ? - You can 't be here . Sakura means cherry blossom . Did you hear me ? You have to go . I think Sakura is a room and I need to find it . I don 't know what it is you 're doing . Christine . but I need this job . I promise this will never get back to you . too . uh ... I didn 't know where else to go . Come on . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have come here . But you did . Frank . To life . " Why did you say that ? Why ? why do you think ? I think I remember hearing it as a kid . maybe . Yeah . I 'm not Jewish . That 's okay . We won 't hold it against you . It 's okay . Clara . this is Frank . it 's the three of us now . Losing people is one thing . uh ... that 's another . would you mind if - - if we said a prayer- - the kids and me- - for Laura and John and Emily ? In Hebrew : " May His great Name grow exalted and sanctified " - Amen . - Amen . " in the world that He created as He willed . " " May He give reign to His kingship in your " " swiftly and soon . Now say : " Amen . [ Different phone conversations being monitored ] " May His great Name be blessed forever and ever . " Heard the Crown Prince isn 't gonna make it . Got to be the Nazis . and lauded be the Name of the Holy One " " praise and consolation that are uttered in the world . Now say : " Amen . " May there be abundant peace from Heaven " " and life upon us and upon all Israel . Now say : " Amen . " upon us and upon all Israel . Now say : " Amen . Amen .

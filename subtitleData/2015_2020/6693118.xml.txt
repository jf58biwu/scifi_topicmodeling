OK . ... very special day , and frankly , I don 't care to hear anymore about the sick need you have to update your Facebook status . - Special day ? - Tyrannical reign of these little bastards is coming to an end . This is the time that the people at the bottom , we rise up and we take down the powers that be . And who are the powers that be ? Spoiled little shit bags . We have no authority over these kids . They know that every disciplinary action we take is merely a suggestion because they make one little phone call to their rich little daddies , and all of a sudden , Little Billy doesn 't have to make his own bed anymore . I got to make his own bed , with these hands . - So this is about Billy ? - Fuck Billy ! No ! Well , yeah , but it 's not just about Little Billy . It 's about all the Little Billies . Stop calling them Little Billies . Fuck ! What 's his name , the kid who shit himself ? Don 't talk about Puraj . Yeah , Puraj , the Puerto Rican kid . He 's Indian ! You 're missing my point . What 's your point ? We 're gonna butt-fuck these kids . Who are you butt-fucking ? No one , Jess . It 's all good . You look really sweet . Good . I love her . I can 't believe she 's my fucking girlfriend . It 's forever . Yeah , well , it 's just a water fight , so ... calm down . Butt fuck ! Good morning , campers . I hope you have your running shoes on today , 'cause I 'm fucking coming for you , you little shits ! Yeah , see ? There he his . You 're finally living a little , instead of that emo , brooding bullshit . You want to jerk each other off ? - What ? - Just touch it . What the fuck ? Get outta here .

My God . You OK ? Yeah , I think . Yeah , I ... I think so . Remember ? Goddamn it , I can 't remember . Shit ! Think , Adam ! Which one of you fucking retards was screaming " Syria " and beaning kids with water balloons ? Well , I guess that would be both of us . Well , not really . Both of us were throwing water balloons , to be honest , but , you know , it was for fun . Yeah , but we were throwing water balloons , but one of us was yelling " Syria " ; " Run , you little faggots " ; " Your rich parents can 't save you . " That was one of us . It got out of hand out there , man . What 's your excuse ? All right , OK , OK . Jesus Christ . You know what ? Get the fuck out of here . And take that fucking shirt off . It 's disturbing . I 'm gonna have nightmares . It 's not play time , it 's nap time . Adam . No , just stay there . I 'm gonna manage everybody on my own . Keep drawing . Do what you do . What 's this idiot doing ?

They picking on you again ? Come on , man . OK , look , believe it or not , I wasn 't always this cool . Kids used to mess with me all the time . But , you don 't care about that . You just want to get ' em back , right ? What was that ? ! Shut up and go to sleep . Something wet keeps on hitting me ! Hey , kid , shut the fuck up and go to sleep before I start taking privileges . Hey , excuse me . Is ... is she OK ? You mean Katie ? - Yeah . - Yeah , she 's great , except for the big-ass dent that you put in her forehead and the 4 stitches . Four stitches ? Shit . Well , can I apologize to her or something ? You can try , but if you 'd just split my head open , I 'd bust you on your ass . OK . You scared the out of me . Out of you ? What are you doing lurking over me like that ? Are you crazy ? I 'm sorry . Look , I ... I made you something . It 's you with your head split open and your brains falling out . Look , please go . I really don 't feel like talking . I 'm trying to apologize . No , you 're not . You just feel bad because you were acting like a moron and somebody got hurt . Sorry if your stupid doodles don 't exactly lift y spirits . Stupid ? Whatever . I tried . OK . Try not busting anyone 's head open on your way out . Douche bag . So you won 't say " shit , " but you 'll say " douche bag " ? Fine . Whatever . Forget about it . I 'm not sorry , Katie . Fuck you . Abandon hope ! We 're going down ! Fuck you , too ! Yeah , yeah . Fuck you ! God ... And that 's what you get ! Rad . Your douche-bag friend dropped this off for ya . Thank you . What are you doing ? I look terrible . I 've seen worse . Well , can I see it , at least ? No . What , it isn 't another apology doodle ? No , you got yours . This is ... This is another one . This is just for me . You like it ? Yeah , I do . I actually really do . I think I can do better . Yeah , I 'll start right now with that beautiful onesie . Yeah , thanks . I know it . ! You know , earlier , before I twisted my ankle , when I said " Fuck you " and some other things ? I apologize for that . Thanks . I really do . OK , ready ? There we go . I felt it . I felt the care , the love . - I don 't usually ... - I don 't like swearing . I don 't usually say fuck , you know . See , now , that mildly offends me . That I just said that I ... Mildly or , like , actually ? - Mildly , mildly . - OK . Fuck . ! Actually , I made something for you , and we can talk to each other . Hey , my name 's Adam , and I 'm really angry all the time . Is that her ? Yeah . " Hey , you ! I 'll bust your ass . " " I 'll bust ... " ... shit . Dizzy-ass white kids . Yeah , I 'll bust your ass . Sorry . I really do respect you . " Dizzy-ass white kids . " How 's your , your wound ? It 's ... it doesn 't hurt anymore . Here , can you see anything ? They wanted to , like , shave my head , but I said no . I can 't ... no . You look ... - Then yes , I 'm fine . - You look healthy . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Katie ? Katie . What the fuck ? ! My God ! What is wrong with you ? Are you kidding me ? Jesus ! - My God . - That 's insane . - The look on your face . - No , it 's real funny . Real funny . What 's wrong ? I was just kidding . I know , I ... I thought something might have happened to you . I don 't know . Like what ? Why ... Why would that matter ? When I was a kid , I ... got lost in the woods . I got turned around in the forest a couple blocks from my house . You know , I was out there for a couple days . What 'd you do ? Found a log and I crawled inside . I don 't know . I was alone . What the hell ? - Sorry , I 'm sorry . - That 's hilarious to you . - OK . - It 's horrible . I 'm sorry . I laugh at really inappropriate times . No . " Inappropriate " ? This is beyond inappropriate . I 'm baring my soul to you . I 'm emotionally traumatized . No , I can 't be in a room alone . I have this phobia , and it 's funny to you . No , I 'm sor ... I 'm ... I 'm good . I 'm sorry . - Done laughing at me ? - Sorry . Yeah . - And my pain ? - Yeah , I 'm good . You know , you 're messed up . Yeah . You know the really messed-up thing ? My ankle 's totally fine . Are you tired ? No . Not really . Why ? ... what do you say we , you know , sneak out of here ? There 's a staff meeting tonight . No one 's here . Like to come here by myself and relax sometimes , you know . It 's peaceful , quiet . OK , I , I thought you had a phobia of being alone . I ... I mean , yeah , but I like to come here and think , you know , and let the stillness of the water relax me . - What ? - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You ... you know this is basically the camp toilet , right ? What the hell ! Why are you laughing ? I 'm trying to tell you ... Adam , stop . This is ridiculous . What ? I 'm being serious . I 'm trying to tell you that I feel very connected ... Adam . OK ... this is all very cute , but , seriously , are you kidding ? Adam , you are not capable of a serious relationship , and I came here to make out with you and then to go to bed . W-what ? No . Katie , I want to be in a relationship , OK ? I want to fall in love . So girls have this tendency to gossip . It 's kind of our thing . Everyone knows this is your little sex den . My little sex den ? Yep . You know ... my grandfather had Alzheimer 's , and every day , my grandma used to change the date on his newspaper just so he wouldn 't , like , lose his mind . That 's love . It 's this false reality you share with someone . That 's how I feel about you , Katie . No , it isn 't . What you 're feeling is just a rush of 19-year-old-boy testosterone with the intense desire to jam your penis in me and , you know , that 's fine , too , but ... it 's not love . This is what I love about you . Don 't even use the word " love " with me . It would be such a gross misuse of the term that , as a woman , I 'm actually kind of offended . But I don 't mean to offend you . I just ... Look , Adam , OK , I 'm gonna make a rule . You can 't say those words to anyone until you actually mean them , OK ? Like , really mean them . Like , feel it in your gut , can 't keep it in or it might just burst out of you kind of feeling . Until then , just don 't , OK ? - Do you promise ? - Yeah , yeah , I promise . Fuck ! Katie , Jesus . Also , you shouldn 't swear so much . It makes you sound kind of stupid . Can we make out now ? Yeah , yeah , I guess so . I mean ... Fuck ! Forestry Station 14 , this is Camp Yellowjacket . Over . Forestry Station 14 , this is Camp Yellowjacket . Over . Forestry Station 14 , this is Camp Yellowjacket . Is anyone there , please ? Over . Camp Yellowjacket , this is Station 14 . That you , Kevin ? Over . No , Frank . It 's Adam . Over . Were you outside a couple minutes ago ? Did you see anything fall from the sky ? Over . You 're breaking up , Yellowjackets . Can you repeat that ? Over . The , counselors got all the kids settled in their bunks . I don 't think they 're gonna go to sleep anytime soon , but ... at least they 're corralled , so ... This is some crazy shit ! A plane , a plane crashed just outside camp . Over . Don 't touch anything . Did you see where it hit ? Over . Near ... near Skyview Ridge , I think . One or two miles south of us . - Over . - All right , Yellowjacket . We 're gonna send up some rangers to investigate the possible crash site . Just stay put , take care of the kids . We don 't want anybody getting hurt . Over and out . Y-yes , sir , we 'll stay here . Over . We 're gonna go up there , aren 't we ? I don 't see how anyone could have survived that . Holy shit . I ... I 'm staying here . What the fuck happened ? Jesus Christ . Holy shit , man ! This is fucking nuts . What 's that smell , man ? I shouldn 't be breathing this . It stinks . Guys ? Guys ! We need to leave . Holy fuck ! What do you think 's in there ? I don 't know , man . It could be secret documents proving God knows what . Could be CIA , NSA . Clark , let 's just go . No , no , no , we can 't just leave this here for some random people to stumble by and grab it . We 'll take it back to camp ... No , Clark , we need to leave . ... collect a reward . - Seriously shut up . - Hey , guys ! Hey , guys ! No , no , no , no . Look , look . Listen , it 's almost open . I 'll just open it , and if it 's documents , we 'll just leave it . Don 't touch the case . No , Clark ! What the ... Shit . Adam , don 't touch it . Fuck ! Get off of me ! What the hell is wrong with him ? - Jesus Christ ! - Shit ! What the fuck is wrong with him ? What 's up with his eyes ? No , no , no , no . Clark ! Clark ! - Get off me , man ! - What the fuck ! Get off my friend ! - Come on ! - Get in the fucking truck ! Run ! Run ! Run ! - Get up there ! - Hurry , hurry , hurry ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Shit ! - You OK ? - Yeah , man ! Clark , get the fuck out of here ! What was that ? What was that guy ? I 'm fine . No , I 'm fine , I 'm fine , totally normal . This happens , this happens at camp . How are you feeling ? Miss ? How are you feeling ? I 'm fine . It 's all up in my head . It 's all a dream . Just a ... I 'm talking to a fucking dead girl . Guy in a camp has stupid fucking memories that make no sense . Stupid memories ! They make no sense . No sense ! Hey , Hon. How was surgery ? Hon , surgery ? W to the power of I equals N to the power of I. Derivative over N to the power of I equals K to the power of I. Derivative over N to the power of I equals K to the power of I. Derivative over N to the power of I minus A Z to the power of ... Jess , are you good at math ? Jess ? Any idea what that means ? Jess , I don 't know . - I do . - Yeah ... What 's the big deal ? It 's camp . Why is everyone so serious around here ? Look , I know . It 's just ... Maybe I should go . No , no , look , I know it 's not a big deal . It 's not . I just don 't want to hurt anyone , you know ? I ... Fine . Just keep it between us , OK ? Ho ! What the fuck ? ! I just felt my dick in me ! I ... Jess , I felt my dick ... fuck me ... I just fucked myself ! What the fuck . I 'm losing my mind . Jess , we shouldn 't have gone up there . It was so stupid . You look better . God damn , I must be going crazy . But , you know , it could be worse . Could be alone ... right ? Katie ? Katie ! Shhhhhh . What ? What is it ? Holy shit . We can 't go out there , man . - Clark , what the fuck ? - We can 't help her . What are you talking about , man ? Shut up ! You 've been out , man . You 've been passed out . You don 't understand the gravity of the situation . I 'm trying to help you . What are you talking about ? He 's still out there . That psycho guy from the plane . You know ? That fucking thing that attacked us . He , like , leaned over Jess and he vomited some kind of black shit in her face . He 's still fucking out there . Clark , we can 't just leave her out there . She 's fucking alive . Shut the fuck up . Help . Help me . Look at her , man , it 's Jess ! He 's waiting for us . Let me out of the car , Clark ! It 's a trap , Adam , it 's a trap . Get off me , man ! My God . I warned you ! I tried to warn you . - What was that ? - It 's just an animal . Come on . - Adam . - Katie , come on . I warned you , I tried to warn you . Jess . Jess . Jesus , get up . No , no , no , no . Clark , just drive . Katie , shut the door . Come on , motherfucker . Drive , god dammit . Clark , go ! Come on , god dammit . Hey , we got to walk . What ? Clark , just get the door . Help ! Somebody help us ! We need help ! What do we do ? Help me . Help me , please . What the fuck are you doing ? What the fuck did I do ? Clark , help me . Clark , help me out . What do you want me to do ? - What the fuck ? - Clark , help . What do we do ? What do we do ? I don 't know . Stop , stop , stop , stop , stop . Adam ! Jess ! We can see it all . We can see everything . Jess ... baby ? We 're gonna get you help , OK ? You don 't need to help us . Us ? Clark , come closer . Dude . Come closer . Closer . Adam . Here . What the hell is going on ! He 's stabbed . Phone don 't work . Goddamnit . Hello again , Subject 14 . How are you feeling today ? It 's back to we again . Anyway , this strain is unusable and it 's piece of shit . Yes , Subject 14 ? That 's quite impossible . Your question is irrelevant . Subject 3 has broken free . We are freeing Subject 8 and 9 as we speak . We will be inside this room in 30 seconds . That 's not going to stop us . We 'll still get in . Isn 't this what you wanted , Yuri ? Isn 't this easier ? The time is coming . You 'll need to decide . It 's a simple choice . You should have known , Yuri . We were never going to be controlled . Shooting this body will not change the outcome . We will be in this room in 10 seconds . To the mask . Get the mask ! What the fuck ? Here . Let me help you . What are you doing ? OK , this might hurt . - Ready ? - Yeah . Sorry . Haa ! Heh . How does that feel ? It hurts . Here . So , what 's the plan , guys ? OK , well , I guess we gotta go get the van , and start moving kids out . That 's one option , yeah , sure . - Clark . - I might 've thought of a different idea , that 's all . We 're not leaving them here . Look , I 'm just saying I have another plan . That 's not fucking fair , Katie . You don 't know what my plan is . Katie , come on . Clark , what 's your plan ? I 'm just saying I don 't even think that you guys are going to even consider my plan now - based on Katie 's reaction . - Are you being serious ? - What 's your plan ? - It 's simple . We 're in deep shit here . What 's the plan , Clark ? - Fuck the kids . - What ? Daddy ain 't gonna buy you out of this jam . - Clark . - Seriously . Fuck ' em . We can 't say fuck ' em . OK ? They 're a bunch of kids . - We 're the only ones in town . - I can . I said fuck ' em . I 'll say it again . Fuck ' em , fuck ' em , fuck ' em ! It 's out of the question . I 'm not doing that . I told you you weren 't gonna go for my plan . There are 150 kids here under the age of 13 years old . You want us to just leave them out there - to fend for themselves ? - This is bullshit . Clark , come on . You 're not seeing it , man . It 's Lord of the fucking Flies here . There are no adults . We are the adults ! What are you saying ? Is that ... Is that supposed to help ? God . I give up . I 'm done . Good game . We just tied my vomiting girlfriend to a fucking chair so she would stop throwing up some kind of tar shit on us . Wake up , man ! God damn , is it 1,000 degrees in here ? Clark . I 'm sorry about him . What ? I 'm sorry . It 's really not funny . Let 's get out of here , OK ? - Yeah . - Keep it together . We need to get these kids . OK ? We 're all very excited to see how it turns out this time . What do you mean " we " ? You 'll know soon enough . Look , Clark . Look at me , dude . We 're out of here . Are you coming with us ? Just shut up . What is so fucking funny ? You 're all so predictable . Clark , seriously ? Whatever the fuck that means . OK , we 're out of here . OK , Clark ? We left you the broom . She loves the broom . Let 's get out of here . You can untie us . We won 't attack you again . There 's no need to now . Not a chance . We bet there is . We 're already inside your head . There 's nothing you can do about it now . Don 't be the monkey that refuses to walk upright . I 'm not listening to you . Yes . You are . You 're listening because you care . Your emotions make you weak . Riverrun PD , this is Adam Goldstein for Camp Yellowjacket , Is anyone there ? Over . Riverrun PD , there 's an emergency . Someone please pick up . Over . Baby , look at me . What 's wrong with you ? Why are you talking like this ? We 're going to tell you something and you 're going to get upset . Upset ? Why would I be upset ? It 's silly , actually . Nothing worth being mad about . Despite that you 'll smash that broomstick and leave yourself defenseless . What a stupid thing to do . But you will . And after , you 'll realize you shouldn 't be allowed to make your own decisions . Riverrun PD , there 's an emergency . Is anyone there ? Over . Go again , over . There is an emergency here , please . Over . You have nothing to worry about . Over . I need an ETA . I have over 100 kids here , please . Over . No need to worry about us . We 're fine . Over . Try me . Jess had sex with Adam . Shut up . A week of hand jobs got a little boring for her . So she seduced him . His penis was bigger than yours . Just a little . Nothing worth being upset about . But she had intercourse with him . And he performed above average . What are you saying ? We 've got an emergency . We need help . We apologize for the fear you 're experiencing . It will all be over soon . Over . You 're lying . Are we lying ? Or were you looking for Jess Wednesday night , only you couldn 't find her because she was by the lake with Adam . All right , I 'm fine . See , I 'm fine . Stupid mindgames . Stupid . We 're happy you 're OK with it . Because after , Jess couldn 't stop thinking about it . And masturbating about it . Well , it 's perfectly understandable . He 's a good-looking guy . It 's understandable . Perfectly ... Un ... der ... standable ! Why would he ? What ? Why would he fucking do that ? Good monkey . Just keep it running . I 'll get the kids . Adam ! Be careful . To the power of I derivative over N to the power of I. Does anybody know what this is ? No one ? This is part of Price 's model of the evolution of altruism , recited verbatim by an unconscious 8-year-old girl . Why was the dying thought of this girl an equation only known by scholars of Price himself ? This moment forever changed my perspective of science in the mind . I call it the Kayla Phenomenon . The experience of channeling a memory or information that is not your own . And there are countless examples of this Kayla Phenomenon . There 's this 6-year-old girl from Kentucky , who 's never had a flying lesson , but she lands a small aircraft while her father is having a stroke . Or that this patient can explain every detail of his brother 's wedding despite being 2,000 miles away in a coma . This is not science-fiction . This is real . I 'm looking for a small grant to continue my research isolating the cause of this phenomenon . Imagine how shared experiences can shape our future . Or pooling our brain resources for complex applications . Forget about the equation . We could literally have a situation where any one of us can feel what the rest of us are feeling at any given moment . It is truly the ultimate social network . That is impressive . I 'm sorry . I don 't recognize you from the ... Doctor , we have something I think you 're going to want to see . We interrupt this programming ... Adam ! Where the fuck are you ? Puraj ? Puraj . Please stay at home until further advised by a government agency . This is not a test . I repeat ... Puraj ? What the fuck ? Sorry , buddy . Jesus . Please stay in your homes until further advised by a government agency . This is not a test . Katie ! Katie ! Katie ! Clark ! Where is she ? Tell me where she is . You shouldn 't be so worried . After all , she 's not alone . Clark ? Is she with Clark ? We 're watching them together . She 's running across the field . Crying . Her legs are shaking . She won 't make it much longer . Tell me where they are . She 's stumbling . There she goes . Poor thing . We 're crawling on top of her . She 's scared . It will all be over soon . Make it stop . Make it stop ! We 're connected with her . It 's done . That simple . Fuck you . What did you do to her ? We 've improved her . She 'll be with us soon . It 's much better this way . You 'll see . She 's whispering something . What ? What is she saying , Jess ? Adam , run ! Jess , speak to me , please ! What ? Fuck ! Adam . Adam . Shut up . Adam , let us in . Adam . We know a sign is telling you not to let us in . Ignore that . We have to talk . Yeah , I 'm good , thanks . Relax , Adam . If we wanted you dead , we would set the building on fire . Go away , Clark . There really isn 't anything you can do . One way or another , we 're getting in there . You open the door . Do it the easy way . We 'll say what we have to say and then leave . You have our word . If you try anything , you 're dead . That 's enough . Poor Adam . Still this lost boy , hiding in a log . Where is she ? Is that what this is about ? Did you lose your girlfriend ? Do you feel in control ? I feel like you don 't tell me where Katie is , I 'm gonna see the inside of your skull across this fucking floor . You hate us for taking Katie , don 't you ? It was easy . You abandoned her at that van . No , I didn 't . - You didn 't ? - No , I didn 't . When we found her , she was all alone . She was afraid . Shut up . Shut up ! You could have protected her . You left her instead . She was scared . You could 've protected her . You could 've protected her , but you let her fend for herself . You let her go . She was begging , please don 't turn me . I was the one to hold her down . How does it feel , Adam ? How does it feel to lose somebody that you love ? We have found that intense anger is the best cure for your pocket . Clark . The truth is , I don 't hate you . I love you like a brother . You do ? Yeah . But I have a message for you to deliver to all your little friends . There 's something I want them to see . I will find her . Do it . Embrace your anger . I 'm not angry . Shit . Where am I ? Shit ! What the fuck ? Wait , Jess ! Jess ! Jess , Jess , stop it . Fucking stop , Jess . Look at me ! It 's Adam . Please just tell me where Katie is . I don 't know . I don 't know . How do I look ? You look beautiful . - Adam , you should leave . - No . You need to get out of here . You can save us . You can still have a life . No . I 'm not leaving you , Katie . You know , I was wrong about you . No , you weren 't . If this had been last week , I would be halfway down the mountain right now getting pie waiting for the government to napalm this place . That 's nice . Yeah ? You know , there 's an argument to be made that you 're one of the worse things that 's ever happened to me . Well , I 'm sorry I ruined your life . It 's OK . It 's OK . I wasn 't doing shit with it , anyway . It 's OK . It 's OK . Adam , I 'm scared . I know . I know . I know . Adam ... Adam , I 'm dead . You came back . You were here . Remember . Remember . OK . Not my memories , not my memories . Come on focus , focus . A weird Russian experiment in 1984 comes around to 2014 . Then ... then we 've got this thing called a pocket , which I have no idea what that is . Damn it . Has to all be connected , right ? OK . This is your base of operation . Of course , you 'll have as many assistants as you see fit , handpicked , of course . Your lab , your personnel . If there 's any piece of equipment that you need that isn 't here , you let me know , and I 'll get it to you as fast as I can . Just remember , we 're government . We work at the speed of government . The notes from previous experiments are ... Good . I don 't speak Russian . Here are the translations . " Initial trials are encouraging . Subjects are telepathically linked , allowing them to share thoughts and memories . They 've become a single entity ... A bee hive working in unison , their individual desires forgotten . In rare cases , subjects have been able to disconnect themselves from the Hive for small increments of time . I have dubbed these glitches pockets . During this time , their individualism is restored , but they suffer from disorientation and memory loss . " Who am I ? " In most cases , subjects enter a pocket after being confronted with an external stimulus to which they 've ascribed emotional attachment . " This stuff is 20 years old at least . Where 's it come from ? A discontinued Soviet programm . Those commies were into some crazy shit , but , you 'll pick up where they left off . What 's that stuff on their skin ? Side effects of the virus . We 're hoping you may be able to eliminate that , but it 's not a top priority . My theory about the interconnected nature of our minds . My job is to create solutions to future catastrophes . You understand ? When do I begin ? Holy shit . I can tap into the memories of anyone . Goddamn it . I can see it all . I can see everything . The more of our minds we share , the more alike we become , the formula for the perfect life ... 16 hours a day awake , 30 minutes a day of working out , 137 minutes with a loved one , seven minutes being sexually active , just one muted mass working towards the same goal ... Perfection . I 'm still one of them , OK ? I 'm disconnected , but I 'm still one of them . I remember . I 've been coming to this camp since I was a kid . I crave constant attention from women to fight the loneliness . I fucked over my best friend . I 'm the douchebag who busted Katie 's head open and couldn 't protect her . 288 friends on Facebook , 115 friends on Instagram , the memories of seven billion people stuck in my fucking head . I have to focus . I can remember anything if I focus . Holy shit . It 's like ... I can remember anything . It 's like Google . If I just focus on something ... All right . Enough of that . Katie . What 's going on ? What 's wrong with her ? Hold on . You snapped out of it , right ? So whatever you did , she can do , too . I don 't know . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Jess , what happened ? Please just tell me . What ? Jess , talk to me . I don 't know ! I ... I felt something . I was freaking out , and then I just ... Think . I ... I ... I saw ... I saw ... I saw faces . I saw your ... Yours and her face , and then I ... I don 't know ... I woke up in this chair , and I 'm tied up in this chair . It 's all I know . Wait . So if you remember something from your life or something emotional , you can ... can come back from it ? I need your help , OK , Jess ? We 're gonna get out of this shit hole , - I swear to God . - OK . Dr. Baker , you have another applicant in your office . I 'm waiting on ... Fine . I 'll go in there now . I don 't know how you expect me to get any work done around here . What 's happening ? We 're waiting . Hi . I 'm Dr. Baker , and you are ... My name is Yuri . I 'm sorry . I thought ... - I thought your name was ... - It 's Yuri . OK . Well are you familiar with the position ? I 'm not here for the position . I don 't understand , but we 're very busy . My name is Yuri . Yeah . I got that . Yegorov . Dr. Yegorov ? Once Katie turns , we 're gonna ... We 're gonna remind her of something to bring her back just like you were brought back . That 's not gonna work . Why not ? It 's too late ! I have so many questions for you . I 've read all your notes . The virus is shockingly resistant to change . I 've been ... Dr. Baker , I know where you 're going . The subjects will become hostile and determined to spread . Their intelligence and brain power by far exceeds our own . It 's impossible to control them . This is evil . With all due respect , doctor , we disagree . Don 't write it off as evil just because you failed to control it . I 've been poring over your work for months . I thought you were a genius . Dr. Baker , do you know what word " kaniez " means ? I don 't know that word . It means the end . Adam ... Aagh ! Aagh ... Fuck . Shit . Katie . Katie , stay with me . Katie , I 'm gonna figure this out , OK , and then ... and then I 'll come back from you . Katie , stay alive and hang on . Adam , wait . Where is she ? I will find her . Katie . We were expecting you . Look , Katie . Look at me , OK ? You can come out of this . Just remember who you are . Remember what 's important to you . We know what you 're trying to do . We don 't want to change . We 're perfect now . Your pocket will end soon , and you will be back with us . It 's better this way , Adam . Can 't you see ? You will never have to be alone again . No . No . We know how this conversation ends , and while you 're doing the wrong thing , it 's ... It 's important to us that you don 't feel sad . How does this conversation end ? With you bashing Katie 's head in with your bat . If you are smarter than me , then where is everyone ? Why haven 't you burned this place to the ground ? I mean , you saw what I did with Clark . Why haven 't you sent in your little drones to come help save you ? You are of no threat to us . This body is of little importance . It 's important to me . We know . You know when I first told you about my feelings for you before any of this shit happened , it wasn 't really it . We know . You 're not as smart as you think you are . You were wrong about the bat . Nngh ... Look , Adam . OK . I 'm gonna make a rule . You can 't say those words to anyone until you actually mean them , OK , like , really mean them , like , feel it in your gut , can 't keep it in or it might just burst out of you kind of feeling . Until then just ... Until then just don 't , OK ? Nngh ... I love you , Katie . OK . Apparently , it was a jolt of electiricty that restarted my heart , and then I woke up in the hospital . Come on ! Can 't fucking die ! Shit . Up , up , up . OK . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . What the fuck happened ? OK . Here we go . This better work . One , two ... three . Katie , wake up . Katie ? Wake up , Katie , please ! Holy shit . Katie ? My God , it worked . Here , sit up . Sit up . Come on . Just ... Just breathe . Just breathe . It 's OK . It 's OK . Katie , focus on breathing . Trust ... trust me . Trust me , Katie , please . Who the fuck is Katie , and who the fuck are you ? You swore . That 's good . Adam , wait . You came out of it . You had no memories at all . You had no idea who you were or where you were , so I 'm gonna give myself a little note , a reminder . Please never ask me to do that again . I think I shit myself . Can you please tell me what the hell is going on now ? It will all start to make more sense when your memory starts to come back to you . Shit , for now , we have to get the fuck out of this infirmary . OK . There 's a van in the parking lot . It 's our best bet . If we take the forest path , there 's a chance we 'll get there unnoticed . But I don 't even remember ... Katie , Katie ... Katie , you 're gonna have to trust me , OK ? Everything 's gonna be OK . There 's some masks and gloves behind the nurses ' desk , OK ? We 'll get those before we leave . OK . Let 's go . Remember . Remember . It 's up to me . - Nobody moves . - Do what he says . Back up . Back up . Give me the samples . All of them ! Don 't do this . Dr. Baker , unless you want to die today , I suggest you do everything I say . Put them in . - Is this everything you have ? - Yes . Yes . - Is this everything you have ? - Yes ! Come on . Let 's get the fuck out of here . This is not good . Stop him ! Yaagh ! Katie , just get the van ! Yuri , wait . You don 't understand . Start the plane ! For the love of God , start the plane ! Rrgh ! Start the plane ! Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . OK . You win . I give in . Just remember Katie . Get in . Remember . Remember Katie . Please just remember Katie . Remember Katie . Maybe I lied to her ... but soon , she 'll remember everything . She 'll know . She 'll remember the speed and aggressiveness in which the Hive spread everywhere . She 'll remember the last holdouts of humanity falling . She 'll remember the five days that she spent locked up in the infirmary starving to death waiting for me to find my pocket so I could save us . She will realize that there 's nowhere for us to go , that I lied to her . Everything is not going to be OK , but for now , she still has hope . Katie , you know , she once told me that love is a false reality , and now I 'm building her one . I ... love ... you .

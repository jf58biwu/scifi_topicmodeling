 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha . - Okay . This is how it all started . Four kids with nothing in common got lost in a forest , and ended up in an alternate universe where they were never born . Bummer , right ? That was Felix 's fault . My brother . He discovered that hidden inside some people are elemental forces that can be used together to create powerful magic . Felix is a fire element . He controls living flame . Andy is the brainiac of the group . His element is water . Sam is air . In element and in nature . Jake is earth . Solid , dependable and normal . Sort of . Then three 's me , Oscar . The spirit that holds everything together . I have kind of magical visions . Fighting demons , and each other they finally found their way home . Bringing with them a magical talisman , and discovering a secret lair hidden in Bremin high school . But , who built it ? And why is it there ? - You 're never gonna give up , are you ? - Must be a clue in here somewhere . - Too bad they didn 't leave a name tag . - How can someone leave all this but no clue of who they are ? I need more light . - Felix , careful . - Oops . - Lucky I 'm a water element . I hope those spells aren 't crucial to the survival of the universe . - Well , in my luck ... Even if we can 't find the owner , this is still the perfect headquarters . - For ? - The greatest magic group of all time . - I 'm not sure if you 've noticed , Felix , but Jake and Sam are only interested in themselves these days , - Yeah , and Andy 's off on some top-secret nerd quest . He 's barely even at school . - And without all four elements , no magic . - They 've just been busy . We 'll get them back ; We 're a team . - What if it 's time for a change , Felix ? You 're fire , I 'm water , if we find new water and air elements , we can form a new team . - And dump the others ? - Technically they 've already dumped you . - No one 's dumping anyone . Okay ? A secret compartment ? - In a secret compartment . That 's a lot of secrets . - The Book of Shadows ? - Ancient . Cool . - It won 't budge . - Needs some girl power . - Why won 't it open ? - Magically sealed . Whatever 's in there , must be good . - Insanely good . - So , how do we open it ? - This is just what we need . - Make sure you film me putting the Vanguardium in the magnetic field . - Andy , I know . Where the lines all intersect , there is an increase in ambient magnetic fields . Vanguardium acts as a sensor . My research says this has to be it . - Your research ? - This is it ! The camera ! My studies using science and magic , will change the foundations of scientific knowledge . The very way we see the world . Why aren 't you filming ? Look ! - Andy ! Who discovered the lines in the first place ? Who told you about these intersections ? Me ! - Yes your daughter has been very helpful . - Can you hear yourself ? You 're an egomaniac . It 's Felix . - Why 's he calling you ? - Because you never answer him . Maybe he can film your experiments , because I 'm done . - Yeah ... Yeah ... - Whoo ! - He amplified . - That was mad , brah . Sick move . - Well , what did you expect ? And that 's it . My first pro video with Gleamer . I 'm super excited . Mad props for my new Gleamer board . Couldn 't do my tricks without it . - Welcome to the family , kid . - Sweet ! I 'll be right back . - Do your thing . Mia ! Where are you going ? - Really Sam ? You asked me here to admire you using your powers ? - Well , yeah . No , I mean , I mean ... - Hurry . Rescue him before he says something intelligent . - Please sign my board . - Twenty bucks for selfies , ten for pencil cases and t-shirts . - How , how much to sign body parts ? - That 's just weird . - Alright , that 's the last of it . - Whoohoo ! - Exciting , hey , Jakey ? Eh ? - Yes . - A fresh start . All gonna work out beautifully , mate . - Go on . We 'll finish up here , won 't we ? - Yeah . - Go see your friends , Jake . - It 's cool , mum . I 'm just stressed . We get two training scouts coming tomorrow . I wanna be on top of my game . - When the boys went to the other universe , Andy met an alternate version of Ellen and they fell in love . Since coming back to this universe , things have been , well , awkward . - Guys ... Uh ... Hey , Ellen . - Hey Andy . Uh , been a while . - I didn 't realize you 'd be here . - You . I was worried this whole love triangle thing had lost its weirdness . - This is it . - Fascinating ! Do you think whoever this belongs to created the lair ? - Has to . I can 't open it . And I 've got spells to go to other dimensions , to create scrying pools , you 'd think opening a book would be easy . What ? - You coming to me for magic advice . It feels like a personal triumph . - I could have figured it out myself . Eventually . - Give me a break , both of you . - I think I can help . - Ooh , laminated . - That 's your Book Of Shadows ? - I got pretty deep researching traversable wormholes on the web . - The web ? So you found a spell written by a Harry Potter fan ? - magic and technology don 't have to be at odds . Not every spell in comprised by candlelight and quill . I found an unlocking spell . - This could work ! With a bit of Felix pizzazz . - Who would have thought ? You two long lost lovers together again . - Let me know when you open it . I 'd like to see it . - Where are you going ? - You 've already got a water element for your spell . You don 't need me . - Andy , come back . It 's your spell . You do it . The next one 's mine , okay ? Let 's get them some their time . - Wait , why do I have to go ? - Because I 'm not gonna be the only one who misses out . - We 're still gonna need Jake and Sam . - I tried calling them . - You might need to be bit more ... persuasive . - Ho , nice one ! - The guys gotta love you . Hold on . - Your phone is going mental . Probably an emergency or something . - What is it , Felix ? - We 've got a situation here . You idiots have gotten yourself into trouble . Come down here . - Ryles ! - ... we need your help . - You want to win this scholarship , you need to focus . - Yes , coach . - Riles , where are you going ? Riles ! - Ha ... it 's comfy . - Catches light . You ready ? - I was born ready . - Wilfred 's phone . - ... an emergency . Get down here ... - Sam , there 's someone yelling something about danger . - It 's just them . It 's just a private joke . Don 't worry , they 're friends . I 'll be right back . - Sam ! Sam ! - I know it 's been awkward between us since you got back . - It 's not your fault . I 've kinda been focused on other things . - It 's just ... the four of us have been through so much together . Sucks to lose that . - This emergency better be good . I just skipped on the single most important practice of my life . - It is an emergency , I swear . - Alright , who do I put on blast ? - Was your jacket so reflective ? - It 's fashion , Andy . - Is there a functional reason ? - It doesn 't ... it doesn 't need a reason . I 'm modeling it . - You 're a model of what , zit cream ? - Guys , we 're a team , remember ? - You said this was a life or death emergency , remember ? - Okay . I was a bit dramatic . But it 's kind of life or death . For our magic . - Felix found an ancient book in the lair . If we can open it ... - Through magic we could have . - Wait ... What ? - We 're here so you can play with magic ? - No , Jake ... I can 't open this without you . I need the four of us to cast the spell . It 's ... I thought ... this book might help us . - What 's gonna help is me not missing my footage trials . I just wanna get my scholarship and get out of Bremin . - Hey dude , I got my elemental power . Who needs a drag of talisman and magic spells when I can just do this ? - I 've spent months trying to find the owner of the lair ; This book could hold the answer . Please . I need your help . And if we open the book , no more hand holding ? That 's the plan . - And then we 're done ? - I guess . - Let 's get this over with . - Before we begin , I wanna say all four of us together again , it 's great . Really , I mean ... - Hurry up ! - Okay , okay ! - ( all together ) Keeper of wisdom , hear my call . Transcend your bonds and reveal to all . Earth , water air fire . - A talisman ! - Well , that was unexpected . - I knew this book was gonna be special . - Is it too much to as for things to go right for once ? - Felix , what the hell ? - Team , here lies a demon , Tree ! - Focus , Andy ! - I 've got this ! I 've got this ! - Alright , boys . Sam , get the talisman . - Hurry ! Okay , let 's do this ! - ( all together ) Water , fire , earth and air , elements that we all share . Water , fire , earth and air , elements that we all share . - Another Felix Ferne epic fail . - If we 'd work together ... - Did you burn my eyebrow off ? You did ! - It 's twisted . The most important game of my life tomorrow and my ankle 's done . - I had no idea that would happen . - How many times have we heard that ? - We did succeed in opening the book . - Yeah , but I 'm down one eyebrow . - Sam ? No one cares . - My fans care ! They want two of them ! - Felix ... - Fans ? Are you kidding me ? - You 're right . This book of Shadows uses the most complex spell I 've ever seen . - Incredible ! With this magic , we 'll be stronger than ever . - No ! No more magic ! No more ... this . I 'm sorry , hombre , but in case you haven 't noticed , we suck together . - Andy ? - Well ... I am curious . But you 've got Helen as a water element . - But if we 're not together , than we can 't do magic spells . - That 's the point ! - Not necessarily . This is a spell of separation . So we can do magic individually . - It can break the bond between us . Guys , wait ! - There 's one problem , though . - What is it ? - We have to destroy the talisman . Thanks guys , This means a lot to Felix . His life is kind of meaningless without magic . - Thanks , Andy . - If I do this , you 'll give me a spell to get my eyebrow back , right ? - You can do the spell on your own . I don 't know , guys . Doesn 't that seem crazy ? Splitting the talisman ? - You didn 't seem so worried when you let a light demon loose on us . - Felix , to unbind us we have to split it . - But it protects us . - Imagine , Felix . Our own magic . It 's the only way . - ( all together ) What was four shall be one , and what was one shall now be four , Find the elements to each shard , and hold the power of them all . - That 's it ? - What now ? - I suppose we take one each . - No , thanks . I 'm done ! - Come on , Jake ! Just remember what we 've been through . - We 'll still see each other at school . - Unless you get your scholarship . - I 'll be back on weekends . - We can share our findings , right ? The book of spells ? - Yeah , I guess so . - I guess ... - ... that 's it then . - Wait , can men hug ? - You think ? - Not really necessary , is it ? - Then there was one . - There is so much hidden beneath the surface of our world , so much that we don 't see or understand , like negative space , a place that exists in between universes . For a while , Andy was lost there . But then , he met Bear , the guardian of negative space . Bear keeps all the craziness of the multi-verse in order . But , to do that he needs human help . His latest recruits are our friends , Phoebe and Alice . - Imagine a galaxy . Good . Now imagine the cosmos . - I could get used to this . - There 's something wrong . - A disturbance ? - More than that , I fear . - I can 't see anything . Why are the shadows spreading ? - They 're hiding something . - Order must be restored . - Let me go in . - Another disturbance . - Your turn , Tegan . - Maybe we should wait for Alice .. I 'm ... I 'm new to this . - You are a Guardian . It is your duty . Don 't be afraid . I 'll power you . Bear taught me . - Whoa ! Whoa , that tickles ! Order must be restored . - Someone 's having a good time . - Dad 's specialty . Rubbery pancakes and music by dead people . - You look wrecked . - I feel worse . - How 'd it go ? - We opened it . But in the process , we ... kind of broke up . - Sorry . But maybe it 's a good thing . There 's so much magical potential in Bremin that all we have to do is find two new elements . And then we can form our own team . We still got the talisman . - Actually ... something else happened when we opened the book . - You broke the talisman ? - I have to show you something . Elements , reveal and show what I seek , what I must know . - What ? Scrying pool . You 're doing magic spells on your own ? Felix , I still need three other elements to do magic , remember ? What about us ? What about working together ? - Oh , I didn 't mean for that to ... - Didn 't it occur to you ? What it would mean for me ? - I 'll help you find the other elements ... - Don 't bother . It 's clear I 'm not that important to you anyway . I get that . - No , I 'm sorry , I ... I didn 't think that ... Oh ! What are you singing ? - Practice for the big night . Bremin Amateur Musical Theater Society . - Yeah . Right . Good luck with that . - Trouble in paradise ? A bit of a tiff ? - It 's nothing . - Eh , son . Take some advice from an expert . Sometimes with women , you gotta work to keep the magic alive . - Sorry , dad , but you 're giving me " The talk " now ? I 've got the internet . - Right . Yeah . Of course you have . Well , these pancakes aren 't gonna burn themselves . - It better be worth it . - Jennifer Bindies ? Bare feet . That 's just rigged . - This is yours for the taking . No need for magic . No tricks . - I am now ready for a critical new experiment . With my control of magic , I can open a laurentian transversable wormhole . Theoretical concept , which to science has been impossible to create . Until now . Um ... curious . Divinity of the elements , I summon thee . Through this world , we can see another place where we can be . Take the fire , make it bend , Take the air , make it turn , Take this water and this earth into another world , call us forth . I 'm back ! - Andy ! What are you doing ? - I had to come back . Is that bad ? - It 's insane ! - I know , right ? We are in the events of this transversable wormhole . Smooth . - Don 't let anyone see . You 've got no idea the chaos you guys caused last time . - Don 't think you need to worry about this bad boy . - You 're still the cutest kind of crazy . - Alright . I need one eyebrow . Where absence lies , let nature grow as power flows . Oh ! God ! - What are you doing ? - I need your help . Please . - Oh , my God , Sam , what have you done ? - Please don 't laugh ; I 'm a freak . - I think I 've got something . - No ! No way ! - You want help or not ? - Ah ! - Keep still ! - I 'd be done if anyone saw me like this . My fans can 't ever know about it . - Your fans ? - Uh-huh . - You 're so full of yourself these days , Sam . I hardly know you . You 've got a choice , Sam Conte , at the kind of guy you wanna be . Because right now , the guy you are really sucks . Straight on to Instagram . Keep the tweezers . - This book ... it 's amazing . There 's incredible power in here . - Just no clues as two who made it . - Who would leave this behind ? - maybe the book will tell me ! - What was it ? What did you see ? - Two kids holding each other in white . A sort of symbol . - I 've never seen that before . - I saw something else . In the lair . A man . He made this place . - Who ? - it was so fast , I only got a glimpse . - Just never thought Felix would be so selfish . - This is the most painful mistake of all time . - Tell me about it ! Andy 's nuts . - Watch where you 're going ! - Ew ! Newbie . - She 's barefoot . - Probably home schooled . - So , what are you gonna do then ? - Avoid him until I graduate . - Weather alert . - Ugh ... Thanks . - What gets me is if we had powers there 's no way we 'd waste them . - Come with me . There 's something I wanna try . - Where is it ? - This means we 're brothers . - I 've never had a brother . - Me either . - This is gonna be fun . - Arts and crafts ? - This is how we find out which element you have an affinity to . I think . - I could just ask Andy to help . - No boys ! Just hold your hands over the bowls . See if you feel something . - Om ... - Take it seriously ! - I don 't wanna be mud . - It 's earth ! If it is your element , you might be able to activate your magical potential ! - You 're at the wrong one . - And you are ... ? - Try the empty bowl . - That 's not supposed to happen . - You 're fire . - Whoa , I 'm like a human microwave . - This is all wrong . Elemental powers don 't just happen . Not so easily . - What makes you so sure ? - Yeah , maybe we 're just advanced . I did skip a year of primary school . - And I 'm definitely more evolved than my brother . - How fun is this ? - Who are you ? - I 'm Tegan . - My god , earthquake , earthquake ! - What was that ? - You control earth ? - Uh-huh . I 'm just like you guys . - That means we 're the four elements . Fire , water , air and earth . - So we can do magic ? - I don 't know . - Sure we can . We just need to find A Book of Shadows . - When you said you had a plan , I was presuming that plan would involve a bit more adventure and excitement . - The lair has to have been set up by someone at school , right ? A former student ? - Oscar , Felix ... This is a rare sighting . Oh , excuse me , boys . A bit of a light weekend reading . - A teacher ! - There 's nothing magical about Bates , keep looking . - Whoa , check it out , it 's dad ! With ... hair . So much hair . And a vest . - That 's pretty much the safe vest . - Look , favorite subject : Music , Physics , Woodwork and Cathy Connor . Mum ! That 's embarrassing . - Let me see that.Maybe teenage mom 's in here somewhere , too . - Wait , what ... what are we doing ? Gotta focus . - He has to be here somewhere . - Let me try . - Feel anything ? - Hungry - Yeah . - It 's so cool having girl friends again . - Girl friends are the best . - Feels crazy ... a whole crowd , they go crazy . I did a 720 ... . - Who is that ? - You 're amazing . - The vainest person in Bremin . I can 't believe I went out with him . - He was your boyfriend ? - In another life . - Let 's have some fun . Should you blow him a kiss ? - Oh my , Comte . That was wicked . - Sweet prank . - Who did it ? - Earthquake . - Came out of nowhere . - Riles . - Gonna bring the pain . - You found the source of the disturbance ? - No , sorry , I 'm just very ticklish . - It 's getting worse . There 's another disturbance . - More of the darkness ? - No . We know this one . My friend has crossed dimensions . - Andy . - You think it 's connected ? - His timing is more than a coincidence . - Then he might know something . - What ? Well , order must be restored . - You know what helps not to get trapped in negative space ? - Candy Crush ? - Thinking about you . Does that make you feel uncomfortable ? - No . Not at all . - I came back here for you . Oh no ! - You don 't want to ? - Yes ... I mean ... no . I mean ... - What is that ? - Restoring demon ! Run ! - Andy ! - Hey ! Sorry , I know I shouldn 't be here . but in terms of magical disruptions , I 'm pretty benign . - You know better than anyone that you can 't disrupt the natural order . Okay , starting to freak out here ! There 's a darkness spreading across the universe . Shadows . - What 's that got to do with me ? - Bear thinks you can help . You sensed anything strange in your world ? - No ... well ... nothing more than usual . - So there 's been no magical disruptions ? - Actually ... now that you mention it , there was this one thing . - What ? - ( laughs ) - I 'm sorry , Felix . My vision 's so unpredictable . - It 's not your fault . We tried . - It 's like it was right here . I could see a person but their face was ... blurred . - Maybe you 're being blocked by magic . - A thunderstorm , man , that was weird . - A heat wave ? It was like a climate change or something ? - ( Indistinct ) - What the ? - I don 't know ... ( indistinct ) . - The girls did this . - ( indistinct ) . - Who is that ? - What did you find ? - The talisman . The boys found a powerful spell . They divided it . - No ! - What does that mean ? - It means we must act . Quickly . - Come on , come on ! - Who 's that ? - Jake ? Why ? - He 's not the one . - What one ? - Wait ... are you guys alright ? - Yeah . Tegan 's just so cool . - I know , right ? She 's the best . - Stop . We need to talk . - Scouts . - Don 't look so desperate , Riles . This is embarrassing . - Will ! - Jake , I 'm open ! Give it up ! - Merlon , pass it to Riles ! Uh ! - I was completely open , Jake . - I don 't know what happened . I ... I never miss a shot like that . Tell me you didn 't just do that . - Payback hurts , doesn 't it - Payback for what ? - You just can 't handle my success . - You just ruined my life because you think I 'm jealous ? - Of course you are . Of what ? A bunch of primary school kids that like your hairstyle ? Loser . - It 's like a documentary I saw about elephant seals . - You guys , stop bickering . There 's more important things happening . Did either of you made head to know why the girls suddenly have elemental powers ? And who 's that new girl with them ? - With that girl ? She 's the one who said you earthquaked me . - We 've been played . Wait here . - That 's the disturbance ? The little pharaoh blonde ? - Tegan . She is free ? - Who is she ? - A problem only we can solve . - What do you mean ? - Go ! We need restoring demons . - We have to tell Felix what 's going on . - Why does Felix care ? He left you to make your own magic , remember ? - Why is it good enough for them and not for us ? - Hi , I 'm Tegan . - I don 't know what your story is , Tegan , but we need to talk . - Oh , that 's pretty . Can I look ? - Don 't touch that . - Manners . What 's in the bag ? I 'm looking for a big , old , dusty magic book . You seen it ? - No . - I hate liars . - Storming demon . Take cover ! - What took you so long ? So predictable . Your tricks never change . [ Incantation in foreign language . ] - Andy where have you been ? - Guys , we have a problem ! - You think ? - That 's who I 'm looking for . - Ellen , what do we do ? - Since when did I become the bug expert ? - Entomologist . - I found something new . Wanna see ? - Stop . This is not your world to control . - Oh no ? I 'm just starting . Don 't think I 've forgotten what you did to me . Or forgiven . - No , no . Someone needs to stay . - In this mess ? Are we gonna blitz this thing or not ? - So annoying aren 't they ? - Stay back . What do you want ? - What are you gonna do ? Wash me ? Cute friendship band . Friends in high places ? You think you can play with me ? Try . I like games . And I like to win . - Andy ! Nice time to have a shower , dude . - That girl ... - Tegan . She 's trouble . - No Felix , she 's worse than that . - What do you mean ? - Alice , Phoebe . - Are they alright ? What happened ? Are you okay ? - Andy , what are you doing here ? - We need your help . In my world , that girl , it 's total chaos . - Andy , I can 't leave here . - Really ? That 's a shame . Remember this ? - Of course . Our friendship band . - You trust your friends , don 't you ? That must be nice . I had someone I could trust once . - Andy ? - [ Incantation in foreign language . ] - The band . - Isn 't from negative space ... so you can 't control it . Tricky , huh ? - Why ? - You thought you could just forget me ? Forget who we are ? - What are you doing ? I need to keep the alter verse in order . Without it , it 'll be ... - Total chaos ? You abandoned me for this world . Now you 're going to watch me tear it apart . order will not be restored . Not this time . - She 's stronger than anyone we 've encountered . She controls all the elements and the restoring demon . And she 's coming for us . - So what do we do , then ? Some spell to banish her ? - That symbol . - My vision ! When I touched the book , I saw this . - This was at the lay lines . Right into the ground . Where we opened the book , - And split the talisman . - Then Tegan turns up . What if ... - ... we brought her here ? - We 're doing that " finish each other 's sentence " thing again ? - Um ... - But who is she ? - I 've read about this . Chaos sigil . " Against order is the force of chaos . The two exist in a balance . If Chaos separates from Order , the spirit of destruction leads irreversibly ... " - What are you gonna say something cheerful , like the end of the world ? - Not just this one . Every world in the multi-verse . if she wants this book , there must be something in here she 's afraid of . We need to find it . - Now that all four of us can do magic , watch out , chaos . - Jake , where are you going ? - My piece of the talisman 's at home . If this is my last night on earth , I kind of want to see mum . - Okay . Let 's meet at my place later . - ( all together ) Happy birthday , Tegan ! - Again ! - Tegan , that 's the third time . - I have a lot to make up for . - You 're the best , Tegan . - We 'll be friends forever . - What 's with you guys ? Snap out of it ! - Again ! Wrap ! Tonight , we play and stay up all night . Because tomorrow , Chaos rules . - Oh , I thought I heard you . So sorry about your game , Jake . Huh ? Not the end of the world . - What if it is ? - Ah , Jakey . Battles in life make us strong , you know ? You get knocked down you just gotta get back up again . Right ? - Even when you 've got no chance ? - Especially then . - The epic Bates meal is ready . I ... I like seeing you smile . I 'm happy for you , mum . - Thanks , Jakey . It means the world to me . - Don 't worry . I 'll keep fighting . I gotta go , mum , I 'll ... explain later . - Ok . - Hey , dudes ! Finally ! Where have you been ? I 've been looking for you . - Getting take-away . What 's happening ? - What 's the story ? - No story . Nothing . I 'm great , I 'm fine . It 's done . You guys know you 're pretty much the best brothers in the world , right ? I ... uh , I love you guys . - Whoa , alright . Yeah , definitely something wrong . - Take his temperature . - I got some for you , too , man . - Yay , food . - Tuck in , man . - I 'll ... uh ... see you guys later . - What ? hey ! What do you mean ? it 's raining , jump in ! We 'll drive you home . - It 's okay . I 'll see you there then . - Are you crazy ? What are you doing ? - I had to see you . - Andy ... - Yeah . I really did . - Andy , what 's wrong , are you okay ? - Things are out of control in my world . Like seriously . - Andy ... if anyone can handle out of control craziness , it 's you . - You think ? - I know . - Ellen , I shouldn 't gave come back . I was too caught up wanting to be near you . - Will I ever see you again ? - My whole life up until this point has been unpredictable . So I 'll never say never . - Then neither will I. - Tons of cool spells , but nothing with a chaos symbol . Dad , what ? - Come on , boys . Get dressed . - Tonight a star is born . My Bremin Musical Theater debut . - Tonight ? - Don 't tell me you forgot . - We have an assignment due , mum . - No , boys , it can wait . - It 's a matter of life or death . Literally . - Yeah , look , um ... It 's okay . Don 't worry about it . We can 't shove guilt down an unwilling throat . - I 'm very disappointed in you . Both of you . - Sorry , mum . - One thing we can thank Tegan for . - Mr. and Mrs. Ferne . - Have got an assignment due , too , Andy ? - Any luck so far ? - No , nothing . This power is so frustrating . Speak to me . - Maybe it already has . In your first vision , Oscar , what exactly did you see ? - The owner of the lair , the Chaos symbol , a little boy and girl connected ... - I remember something . Like this ? Spell of Revelation . Reveal the secrets to banish shadows to light . Sounds promising . - It 's the best clue we have . It 's the only clue we have . - We 've fought demons , we 've closed dimensions , so of course we thought we could save the world . But we didn 't realize that this was the end . For all of us . - Together again . Just remember ... - No , no inspirational speeches . - We 've seen and done more than most guys our age could ever dream of . The great powers aren 't just a gift , they 're our responsibility . - Did you just quote Spider Man ? - It 's Voltaire . - If Tegan is as dangerous as we think , then , well , this is our town . Our home . Let 's save it . - So inspiring . Don 't you all look so tough and ready for action ? - You don 't belong here , Tegan . - Felix ! Where 's your hospitality ? - Orders to Chaos , and Chaos to Order , the circle of life the endless border , - ( all together ) Reveal the secrets to banish shadows to light . Open the door to cast out the endless night . - Oh ... - This is getting so familiar . - Nice poem , very pretty . A round of applause . - Tegan , you 'll hurt him ! - Obviously . - Don 't be a spoil sport , Ellen . He deserves it for what he did to you . - What happened ? Why didn 't it work ? - The separation spell . Now that we can do magic by ourselves , we can 't do it together . - Then the spell might still work , if I try it alone . - Time to give up what isn 't yours . I want that book ! - Then come and get it . - Mia , are you nuts ? Can 't you see that this Tegan chick is trouble ? - Oh , but you 're so good for me , Sam ? Shame your fans didn 't see that . - Stop . This can only get worse . - You boys have had your own way for too long . You can 't stand sharing your powers , can you ? - Ellen , please , I don 't want to hurt you . - You 're so blinded by your arrogance you can 't see what you 're up against . - Ellen , I 'm on your side . - I know . She wants the book . You 'll have to give it to her or she 'll destroy you . - We can 't . We need it to stop her . - You are magic , you idiot ! - No . - Orders to Chaos , and Chaos to Order , the circle of life , the endless border , - You 're not powerful enough . Little fire element . - Reveal the secrets to banish shadows to light . Open the door to cast out the endless night . - Oh , the olden days . Haha . Want me to step through your little trap door and get lost back in time ? Not likely .

She 's not under Tegan 's influence ? - She 's pretending . - Then she 's in danger ! - Hey , welcome to the club ! - Wasn 't that spell supposed to take Tegan out ? - I thought so . But it only opened a portal . - To another universe . - No , I 'm sure it was to ours , but like ... back in time . - Temporal slip . Interesting . - Looks like Chaos had another win . - You could say that . We got smashed . - Wait . Tegan is Chaos . - So we need ally ourselves with Order ? - We have to get back to Negative Space . To Bear . - And get stuck there like you did ? - Bear can help us . Tegan can 't get the book if we take it with us . - What about Ellen ? - The girls ... the best way to protect them is to KO Tegan . - Spread out further . The spell won 't work unless we 're completely separate . - What about now ? - Keep going . - Dude , I 'm gonna go into a pole . - Elements , obey me , heed my call , become the power , the source of all . - It 's working ! - You actually did it ! - [ Speaks indistinctly ] - What 's that ? - [ Continues indistinctly ] - I don 't know . - Suddenly , going into negative space doesn 't sound like such a bad idea . Um , guys ... - What is that ? - A shadow . Use your fire . - Guys , hurry . It 's closing ! Guys ! I hate being here ! This place freaks me out ! - Don 't be scared in there , Sam .

It 's us you want . - Don 't worry . You 're next . - Stop ! It 's going up in flames , unless you let her go ! - Do it . Save me the effort . - She wants it destroyed . - She went for another plane . Felix , how are your footing skills ? - Don 't let him go ! I want that fool 's Book of Shadows . - Whose book is it ? - Really ? You don 't know ? - Jake ! - That wasn 't so hard , was it ? - Can you get up ? - Ugh , it 's just ... There 's these .

What did he mean ? - Sir , you first have to ... - I have to what ? Where are you ? - Over here. here - Over here. here . Here . - Ah man ! Felix 's stupid big fireballs would be great right now . At least I could see . Guys ! Guys ! Fire ball . I think fire ball and one appears and ... that 's what the little dude was all about . In that case , A ... a bridge would be nice . Sam Conte . Skateboarder . Genius . Savior . - Give me something . Let me help . Stupid pen . - Are you okay ? - I 'm a lot of things . But okay isn 't one of them . - I 'm so tired of running . - Does anyone else wish they had their driver 's license ? - Yep , Andy , that 's exactly what I 'm thinking about . - It 's affecting the whole town . - Her power 's increasing . There 's nothing we can do about it . - But there 's still Sam . Uncle . - She 's destroyed the Book of Shadows . - Game over . We have failed . - I 've failed . - Come on , guys . This is the grand final . The fourth quarters only play our best game . We have to dig deep if we 're going to smash it through the post . - Is he serious ? - Afraid so . - Jake 's right .

It could be anywhere . - Doesn 't make sense ! - Why leave a spell to defeat Tegan unless someone could find it ? - I 've searched in every corner of this place a thousand times . I would have found it . - Felix ! When you did that spell before , it created a portal to our dimension , but at a different time . So , what if what we 're looking for isn 't here now ? - But it was here before . - It was the right spell , but I cast it in the wrong place ! I have to do it here ! Okay , you need to leave me for the magic to work . Everyone out . Hurry . - You did well , Sam . - Thanks , dude . Me and my brain have come to a new understanding . - Good luck with that . - We must hurry . - No , wait ! Now I need your help . You got to help us take care of Tegan . - That 's not possible . - Air can 't leave negative space , Sam . - We must repair our world to keep the rest in order . - But she 's trying to destroy Bremin . If negative space falls , that will be the end of everything . - I ... I can go . - Uh ... Well , I was kind of hoping for someone with actual powers . - And I was hoping for someone with gratitude ! Looks like we 're stuck with each other , airhead . - What is it ? - It 's all my fault . I 'm responsible for this . - You know , I never thought I 'd say this , but this not doing magic together thing kind of sucks . - Come on , Felix , what 's taking so long ? - Guys ! - Oh man ... - Behold . Spell of containment written on the wall years ago . - That 's the real spell to defeat Tegan . - Spell hidden within another spell . Whoever thought of that must be some kind of genius . - Whoa , it 's chaos out there ! - Dad ! It 's not what it looks like . - She 's back , isn 't she ? - What ? - This room , it 's Dad 's ! - You made this place ? You 're the ... - One and only . - But how ? What ... - Questions later . Mr. Fern , is that your spell ? - A earth and nature one . I defeated her with that spell thirty years ago , when I was your age . - You built all this ? - Well , I got straight A 's in woodwork . But I got to warn you , boys . You use this spell and it comes at a high price . - I don 't like the sound of that . - Well , like all most powerful spells , this one demands a sacrifice . - A sacrifice ? - Your magic . Your elemental powers . Everything . Forever . - Everything ? - Forever ? - That 's why I gave up this place . And I hid my identity with the last of my power . - That 's why I couldn 't see you . - I had to start all over again . Luckily I also had quite the talent for retail . So , what are you gonna do ? - I 'm in . - All of it ? Forever ? - It 's the only way . - Ow . - Yes . - Looks like she 's busy . - Guess who 's back ! Look who I brought . - Hi , guys ! - Phoebe ! You made it ! - I know , right ? How sick ! What 'd I miss ? - [ speaks magic incantation in foreign language ] - She 's here ! - You were right , dad . - Of course I was . Do me proud , son . - She 's opening up the barriers between universes . - Tegan , stop ! This world is our home ! - And now it 's mine , too . So , I 'm making some improvements . - There 's only one improvement to make . Getting rid of you . - Well , look who 's here . You got old . A nobody who has lost his powers and has nothing to show for it . - I 've got my family . - Do you ? - Mum ? - What 's happened ? - Mum ? - I don 't think it 's us hurting them that 's the issue . - Please , listen to me . Mum ! It 's me , Jake ! - Mum . - Whoo ! - [ speaks magic incantation in foreign language ] - We need to help the boys . Taegan 's growing in power . We need to take her out . - Yeah , and soon , or we 're all captives . - Let 's crush this nutjob ! - Remind me not to make her angry . - The Kombi ! hurry ! - What ? We 're gonna run them over ? - Jake , Jake ! Go , go ! Hurry , Jake ! - Felix ! - Hang on , Dad ! - Oh , my God ! - It 's time . Fun 's over , Tegan . - Oh , please . It 's only just starting . - Got it ? - Go ! - Stop them ! - Earth , water , air fire ! Elements that we desire ! Earth , water , air fire ! Elements that we desire ! Take this magic from inside and use its power to chaos bind . - It should be working ! - What 's wrong with our magic ? - Help ! Hurry ! - Oscar ! - Of course ! Oscar , we need you to find the talisman ! All the elements together . - Earth , water , air , fire ! Elements that we desire ! Take this magic from inside , and use this power to Chaos bind . - No ! No ... stop it ... No . It 's not fair . - You 've worn out your welcome , Tegan . - Why can 't you just let me have fun ? - ( all together ) Earth , water , air , fire , Elements that we desire ! Take this magic from inside and use its power to chaos bind . - No ! No , please , don 't send me back ! I don 't wanna be alone again ! - Bear . You 're burning up ! You have to go back to your world ! - I dis-functioned the balance of chaos and order , now I must restore it . - You ... - When the universe was born , chaos and order were the same . United . I was the one who broke us apart . I was the one who betrayed my sister . To have my own identity . Become the Guardian . - That psycho is your sister ? - I 'm sorry . Please don 't leave . - We 'll be together . Chaos and order as one . How it always should have been . - What about negative space ? The Multi-verse ? - The Multi-verse existed before me . And it will long after . - I thought we were the Guardians . - Not anymore . Not without Bear . - So , we 're free to return home ? Forever ? - Come , Tegan . Now we go home . - I 've missed you . - Bear ! No ! - So , um ... that was intense . - Hey guys , I think you might be forgetting something . - Where are we ? - What are we doing here ? - [ indistinct conversations ] - Where are we ? - Brian ... - What 's going on ? - So ... no more magic . - Just normal . Perfectly normal . - Group hug ? - Yeah ! - You 've got to admit , that 's kind of sweet . - You 're okay ! I 've been looking for you . The whole town went crazy . - We got it Sam . - So I guess you decided what kind of guy you want to be . - Yeah , I did . - I want to be likable . - Who are you gonna be , Felix ? - I don 't know . Been into magic for so long , forgot what I 'm like without it . I liked being a freak . - Daon 't worry . We can be freaks together . - As if you weirdos have a choice . - It will be good to be normal again . For a while . - You sell yourself short , Felix Fern . You don 't need magic or powers to be special . You are already . And I for one , I 'm a big fan . - The Nowhere Boys story , at least the magical power of it , may have ended . They didn 't know it at the time , but they weren 't the only ones . All around us , there are others like them . Like me , Who will soon discover the powers within them , who will gonna follow Felix , Sam , Jake and Andy 's footsteps . This story isn 't an end . It 's a beginning .

Xang Wan Xu . - With NASA funding [ indistinct ] planets with projects as part of the 2024 acres infrastructure , China 's National Space Administration stepped into a leadership role that 's [ indistinct ] . A big improvement with the BLC , both went to the top of Britain 's military ... - NASA Samsara Liaison continues to deny that the mission has been compromised , insisting that the Samsara Missions International is united in their goals and focus . - I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to earth . And a landing on Mars will follow , and I expect to be around to see it . - Like the science of ignition , space and [ unintelligible ] Samsara exists outside of politics . Half the world wants the death of President Xang . - Commander Robert Xu has met with 48 of [ indistinct ] clearly showing them that the fight will go on . Man will set foot on Mars before the end of the year . - [ indistinct PA announcement ] - Where is she ? - The lab . - You left her there alone ? - She 's fine . Bianca 's doing the blood work . - She likes Bianca . - Yeah . Yeah she does . - OK , let 's go . - Kat ? Kat ? - What ? ! What ? ! - The doctor wants to talk to us . - No ! - About Amelia . Kat ... - No ! - We need to hear what he has to say . - [ indistinct PA announcement ] ... please report to the nurses ' station . - I 'm sorry . - You said it was gone . - What I said was that it was in remission . We always knew there was a chance it ... - You said it was gone ! - It 's never that simple . - Explain it then . Huh ? Feel free to use short words . - The tumors have spread ... - Tumors ? As in more than one ? What are our options ? Chemo , surgery , radiation , what ? - I 'm afraid that ... - None of the above ! I 'm going to be in the lab with Amelia . - All available personnel to the ER ... - Katherine 's been under a lot of pressure . With the ... mission coming up . - I can imagine . And now this . It must be ... very frustrating to ... come so close and then have to step aside and to ... hand over your place in history to someone else . - She 's not stepping aside . We all agree . Katherine 's going to Mars . How long ? - There 's no way of telling ... and in cases like this ... - Amelia ... her name is Amelia ! So this is where the party is . - Daddy ! - Hi . - We 're all done here . But you may want to swing by the cafeteria to get some juice , OK , ' cause I took a lot of blood . - Hmm ... juice sounds good . Crans ras ? Oh , I know , I know , I know ... pickle juice and strained sauerkraut . Sound good ? - No ... I wanna go home . I 'm tired . - OK . Piggyback ride . Huh ? Come on , come on , come on ... Oh , yeah ! Oh , you 're getting heavy ! - Bye , Bianca . - Bye . - Before I met you , the only constellation I could name was the Big Dipper . - Everybody starts with the Big Dipper . And Orion . - Amelia asked me for a telescope . For Christmas . So she could see you on Mars . - I 'm thinking maybe you should get it for her birthday instead . - The doctor said ... the doctor said that we should ... appreciate the time we have with her . It doesn 't matter if it 's three weeks , or three years . - Three years ? He said three years ? He was that specific ? He said three years ? - It could be longer . - I won 't be back for three years . - It could be longer , he said . Amelia 's strong . She 's ... she 's a fighter . She 's like you . - Like me ? I mean , what kind of mother abandons a a dying child ? - You are the greatest mother a little girl could ask for . And the greatest wife . You don 't just belong to us . What you 're doing ... is gonna make the world a better place . Not just for me and you and Amelia , but for everyone . - If there is even a mission ... - Well , you don 't think the Chinese will ... pull out ? - No . But the guy who shot the president ... he was American . - It 's not in the news . - Yeah , they 're trying to embargo it , but the ... the PRC intelligence Agents tracked him down to Hong Kong and took him into custody this morning . He claims he 's part of a group that doesn 't want humanity to leave earth . - If God wanted man to fly , he had given him wings . - Exactly . - What a mess . - It 's all a mess . And all we 're going to do is bring our problems with us . Man 's greatest export to the universe . - My granddad once told me that when he was fifteen it was the worst year he went through . Robert Kennedy was just assassinated , and Martin Luther King , The My Lai massacre happened , Russian tanks were rolling into Czechoslovakia and it was just one god awful thing after another . And there was no reason to believe that 1969 would be any better . And then Apollo 11 made it to the moon ! And Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong ... they left their footprints in the moon dust ! And my granddad said that when he saw those footprints , he felt like crying , because he knew that ... everything was gonna be OK . You need to leave your footprints in the Mars dust so that everyone will know it 's gonna be OK . That no matter what 's happening right now , there 's something bigger out there . You need to give people hope . - We 're going to enhance these beautiful cheekbones . - You alright , sweetie ? - I don 't feel so good . - Do you want ... Oh ... it 's OK , Melie . It 's alright . Oh , thanks . - Oh , don 't cry , sweetheart . Do you need the bathroom ? - No ... - It 's just out the door , to the right . - I 'm so sorry ... it 's ... you know , the meds she 's on , it 's ... - My son had a bad stomach . Cancer . He had cancer . - Alright , baby . - You need some roses on your cheeks . Sit . Alright , roses comin ' up . - Tickles . Sissy ! - How are you , my lovely girl ? Oh my . - Safari njema . Did I say it right ? - Oh ... Perfectly , my dear . I 'll see you there . - Yeah . Constance , can I speak to you a second ? - You look beautiful . - Safari ... nje ... what ? - Njema ! It means " bon Voyage " in Swahili . - Ahh ... - Well , look at you . - Constance gave me roses . - Roses in the cheeks . Constance ... uh , felt that she was ... uh , looking really pale . - I threw up in front of Constance . - Was this before or after ... she gave you the roses ? - Before . I 'm thirsty . - Why don 't you guys go grab something from the snack cart ? Yeah ? Even if the press conference starts on time , you 've got about half an hour . - You want anything ? I know you didn 't eat breakfast . What 's breakfast ? - The most important meal of the day . - That 's right . We 'll get you a muffin . Come on . - Bye . - Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome the Samsara International Space Team . - Jeff Taylor , Toronto globe and mail . My question is for Dr. Liu . You have a long history in heterogeneous catalysis and surface science . You 've pioneered work with nano tubes , nano materials and nano structures . How will your work be integrated into the mission ? - It is the mission . Without nano technology and nano materials , there is no Mars colony . Without me , there is no mission . - So wait , you mean I can stay home and watch the World Cup ? - Hello , Elvis . - Hi , Mira . Nice to see you again . You 'll be in charge of communications for the Sumsar Mission , is that correct ? - That is the word in the street . - So , essentially you 'll be wiring Mars ? - Designing the Colony 's communication infrastructure , yes . And , once I 'm done , you 'll never be able to say " In space , no one can hear you scream . " - Heroku Okomura , NHK . Dr. Voss , you 've said that you 'll be conducting studies into the nature of the dark matter principle . - Yes . And expanding on the groundbreaking work conducted by David Krain . - Can you explain to my viewers exactly what dark matter is ? - Well , if I knew that , Hiroko , I wouldn 't have to go to Mars . - Amina Labibi , Al Jazeera . My question is for you , Dr. Biira . - Yes ? - Your role on this mission is ... more observational and less action . Is it not ? - Are you asking me if I 'm with the band ? Forgive me my little joke , I understand that my function may not seem as important as those of my colleagues ' , I won 't be conducting abstract studies like Kathryn or doing biomedical research like Lucien , but I 'd like to think my work on group dynamics could prove useful in the future . I 'll be expanding on the Mars 500 experiments from 2009 to 2011 , and , on the year-long high seas project of 2015 , which focused on crew member cohesion and performance . Mars is a long way away , and the quarters we 'll be sharing are rather small . It 's not like we can send someone back to earth for a ... a time-out if they get cranky . - Speaking of that , don 't you think given the considerable cost of this mission , that we should be focused on colonization , not simply exploring ? - I think you should consider us more as a landing party rather than an invading army . Our goals are no less ambitious . Our commitment is total , but our scope is more focused . We are there to prepare the way . - Was the failure of the Mars first initiative forcing a reevaluation of this mission ? Did science fail us ? - She 's unsuitable . - The Mars first disaster was not a failure of science . It was a failure of trust . - And you ? You trust this mission ? - I do . - We 'll be back . - Are you really going to leave your dying child to go on this ... adventure ? - I 'm sorry , you 're with ... ? - Dr . Liu , perhaps you 'd like to comment on the allegations that your agency plans to plant the Chinese flag on Mars and claim all the resources for the PRC alone . - You know about the Antarctica Treaty of 1959 . It prohibits military activities , mineral mining , and detonating nuclear explosions in Antarctica . Today , 71 nations have signed it . The Mars Treaty is fashioned on the very same principles . This is a scientific mission being conducted by an international team for the benefit of all mankind . - You mean humankind . - Have I answered your question ? - Yeah , but , um ... just one thing , As far back as 2015 , the International Academy of Astronautics proclaimed that mineral resources found in space are actually game changers . They even went on to recommend us how we can further elaborate to these resources . Are you familiar with the study ? I believe one of the co-editors was you mentor at the Beijing Institute of Technology . - What is your question ? - Just what does Antarctica have that anyone would want ? Penguins ? But Mars ? It will be an intergalactic gold rush . It 's gonna be hard to stay high-minded . - This is what 's wrong with capitalism . - My parents have come to watch the launch ! My mother is cooking tonight all my favorites . Will you come ? You and John and Amelia ? - I have to go now , baby . - I know . I made this for you . That 's Mars . I was gonna draw us a sea , and all this dark moon and [ indistinct ] , but I didn 't have brown . - That 's OK . We could pretend they 're visiting the other side of the planet . - OK . I wish I could go with you . I wanna float in space . - I 'll make you a deal . When I come home , we 'll float together . - Really ? - I promise . - Dad 's sad you 're going away . He says he 's happy but I can tell . - You are just gonna take care of him while I 'm gone . Alright ? Make sure he doesn 't eat ice cream . And that he smiles at least once a day . - He 's ... - I know ... And it 's not good for him , so remind him . - OK . And if I 'm not here [ indistinct ] ? - Come on . - If I 'm not here ? Don 't be sad if I 'm not here when you come back . I 'll make you lots of pictures . Mom ? You 're squishing me . - Sorry , sorry . Sorry baby . - It 's OK . - My ride 's here . Mommy 's gotta go , sweetie . - OK . - OK . I 'll still come home , I promise . Nothing 's gonna stop me from coming home to you . - [ off screen ] Ignition sequence start . 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... - [ off screen ] Prepare for separation . Mark ... - Call F779 ... - [ off screen conversation continues ] [ inaudible ] ... report separation ... it 's over ... - [ inaudible ] ... We 're ready in 10 . - Initiate the docking sequence . [ indistinct conversation continues ] - No , it 's 45 miles . - Not going to land the right alignment tonight . Pick up . - [ indistinct ] 86690 ... [ indistinct ] ... zero degrees . - Perfect , we made it . .144866 swift , over . - [ indistinct ] at one point [ indistinct ] and it 's back to [ indistinct ] - 15161 , over . 10617 ... - Clear out every power [ indistinct ] in the [ indistinct ] group hydraulics . We 're hovering to help them start it . - I hadn 't planned to pick a bullet up to my neck and ... [ indistinct ] and [ indistinct ] . [ indistinct ] has been moved to position . - All I 'm saying is we need to think about it . For 70 years we have been stuck with ' one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind Where is the poetry in that ? - Why are you worried ? You 're not gonna be the first one out the door anyway . - OK ... so what are you gonna say ? - I 'll think of something . - Yeah , see , that 's what I 'm afraid of . - Remember Yuri Gagarin . The first words a human ever spoke in space . He said " Orbiting Earth in the spaceship , I saw how beautiful our planet is . " " " People , let 's preserve and increase this beauty , not destroy it ! " - He also said " I looked and looked but I didn 't see God . " - Yeah , well , he was a godless communist . No offense . - None taken . - Actually he was a Russian Orthodox and he never said those words . That quote came from a speech Khrushchev made . - Now , he was a godless communist . - Amen , brother . 3 YEARS LATER - Flight controllers , we 're looking very carefully into the situation . Obviously a major malfunction . - We have the report from the Flight Dynamic Officer that the vehicle has exploded . Flight director confirms that we are looking at ... uh ... checking with the recovery forces to see ... uh ... what can be done at this point . - If you 're just joining us , here 's what we know so far . At 2 : 57 PM , the Samsera spacecraft returning from its three year Mars mission , suffered what NASA is calling a catastrophic event . The craft suffered an in-flight breakdown as it entered the atmosphere , leaving debris stretching across three states . NASA officials have confirmed that the accident was not survivable . - Mr.Voss ! - Mr.Voss , do you know anything ... - Get out ! - The cable went out . I went online and none of the news stations say anything about the accident . - Maybe it was a mistake. some sort of ... freaky meteor shower . You know ? and then . And them some yahoo at the news just panicked and then went on the air ! - They just don 't want us to know ! She promised she 'd come home . She said nothing on earth could stop her from coming home ! I stayed here for her ! It hurts so much , but I stayed here ! - I know , honey , I know you 're hurting . - It hurts ! Stop it ! - Take a deep breath . Amelia , remember what the doctor said ? Deep breath .. deep ... - I don 't care what the doctor said ! I ... - Honey ... - I want mom . - Amelia ? ! Amelia ? ! Amelia ? Honey ? Amelia ? Oh , honey ... - Look . What is this ? Check it out . - Hey ! Come here ! Hurry up ! - Oh my God . - Was it a missile ? A meteorite ? A goddamned lightning bolt from heaven ? I need some answers right now . Yes . Right now ! - Sir ? You need to see this . - Where 'd you get this image ? - In the satellite feed . - There 's a satellite above the debris field ? Blind it . - We can 't do that . - Do it ! - Sky News is calling . - Ignore what I said ! No one talks to the press ! - It 's Google . - No one talks to Google . - Elvis ... Dr.Price Johnson worked with them . - No one talks to Google , no one talks to the families , no one talks to to no one . This never happened . Are we clear ? Are we clear ? ! - Yes , sir . - Where are you ? I need you in the [ indistinct ] Now . - Good morning . You missed breakfast . But it didn 't look very tasty . Poached egg and grits . Thirsty ? My name is Wyatt Roberts . I work for the Director of National Intelligence . You 'd never heard of us . We 're the guys who brief the president when there are incidents like yours . - Incidents ? I don 't ... - Amnesia ? Seriously ? That 's your play ? - Why are you dressed like that ? - You 're in quarantine . - Do I have Ebola ? - We 're not sure what 's going on with you . Let 's just say you 're in quarantine until we can figure out why you 're still alive . It 's kind of a miracle . - Elvis was looking for you . - You missed the Morning News today . - Oh . Let me guess . Terrorist attacks in London . World currency in free fall . [ indistinct ] found in makeup . - Actually , it was terrorist attacks in Paris . - It 's the same every day ! I don 't even know why they go through the trouble ! - H--how 's Amelia ? - She 's alive . I don 't know how , but she 's alive . - You know , [ indistinct ] study is showing that people can stay out of death when there 's something they 're willing to stay alive for ! - She 's waiting for me . - It won 't be long now . It won 't be long . Awe , we 're going home ... We 're going home . We 're going home . - Yeah . - We 're going home ! - We 're going home ! We 're going home ! - Yes ! - What 's the last thing you remember ? - I was in my daughter 's room , and I was looking at the stars . I have a daughter ... - You were looking at the stars ... Out the window ? - I ... on the walls . She has posters . My daughter , Amelia , she ... she must be worried about me . I need to go see her . I have to go see her . - You 're not going anywhere . - Why ? - I told you . You 're in quarantine . We have some more tests to run on you before you can be released . - I need to see my little girl . And John ... I need to see John . I need to see my husband and my little girl . - And you will . Just as soon as we know it 's safe . - Is that why the door is locked ? Is the door locked to keep me safe ? - No , Dr. Voss . It 's locked to keep us safe . You want to run some tests , right ? Let 's do it ! Where are my clothes ? - You don 't have any clothes . We found you naked . - Found me ... - Now , you listen to me , you son of a bitch . The only thing that 's kept my daughter alive these past three years is the thought of seeing her mother again . And this afternoon she saw her blow up on television ! I got a dead wife , and a kid on the hospital . And the phone number of CNN science reporter on my speed dial , now , if I don 't get some answers pretty damn quick , I 'm gonna start making some noise ! Oh , National Security ? ! Don 't pull that Homeland security crap on me ! If you don 't have the clearance to give me some answers , you better find me someone who does ! - We 're going to be measuring the electrical activity in your brain using these electrodes . - Yeah , I 'm familiar with the EEG technology . - Good . This afternoon we 're going to be doing a PET scan and establishing base lines and compare what we get to the test NASA has on file . - What are you doing ? - Mapping the pleasure centers of my brain . - We already know where they are . - True , but there 's nothing like ... Oh ... Primary research . - Perv . - OK , let 's begin . State your name . - Dr ... Kathryn ... Voss . - Whoa ! - Can you tell from the brain activity if she 's faking amnesia ? - Huh ... - What ? - This is off-the-charts weird . - Weird how ? - Weird as in impossible . What kind of questions were you asking her ? - We ran the scan three times with the same results . And ? Every time she showed the same pattern of activity . It 's like she has complete control over her subconscious mind . - Then she 's faking the amnesia . - Faking ... no . Post-traumatic amnesia is very common . But forget about the bizarre brain waves . Her blood work is what 's really strange . We tested her blood and found 71 amino acids . - 71 ? - Can you just tell me what it means ? - Two weeks before she went to Mars , Kathryn Voss had only 21 amino acids in her body . - So ? - Well , I mean ... Am ... Amino acids ... they 're ... they don 't ... human beings only have 21 . - You 're saying she 's not human ? - Not anymore . - Plus sign . Star . Square . Star . Wavy lines . Star ... . Star ... . Star ... Star ... Star ... . Star ! How are the oxygen levels ? - Down to 19 % . - And ... uh ... how 's the night vision ? - Wouldn 't be a problem unless it 's under 17 % . But the sooner you get those oxygen generators online , the better . - Um – hum . - You know ? I keep thinking if I look at those plants long enough , one of them is going to morph into a [ indistinct ] . - You smoke ? - I 'm French. of course I smoke . Why ? Not for years , but I still remember the taste . - Maybe you can ask Robert to have his nanites whip up some ... cigarettes . - Cigarettes , huh ? And what would you ask him to whip up ? - Hmm ? - Um – hum . - Uh ... chocolat ... - Chocolate ... um ... I like that . - I 'm waiting for you ! It hurts so much ! - [ indistinct ] . - No ! No ! - [ indistinct ] . - Mom ! - Kathryn ? Get up now . - I 'm OK ... . Just dizzy . - You 've got a fever . - I 'm fine . - Robert , can you come to the greenhouse ? Kathryn 's not well . Calm down . - Hello , Agent Robert . - How did you know it was me ? - Your ... uh ... scent ... is distinctive . - You hesitated . You were going to say something else . - I was gonna say your aura , but I thought that might be a bit too Whoohoo for you . - You 're right . What does my aura look like ? - It 's pink ... and sparkly ... like a unicorn 's . - That 's what I thought . - You 're not wearing your gear . Does that mean I 'm not contagious ? I ... I wanna see my daughter . - What lesson have you brought back to earth ? What ... What did you learn that you couldn 't learn on earth ? - I wanna see my daughter ! - I 'd like world peace , but it isn 't gonna happen today . - You know what else isn 't gonna happen today ? Me playing Guinea pig . I wanna see my daughter . - It 's above my pay grade . - Then get out ! - I 'm not the only one with questions , Dr.Voss. And some of those people with questions are not as nice as I am . - Well , are they the ones who blew the Samsara ? - Who said it blew up ? What do you remember ? - Everything was normal aboard the craft , everyone was excited . Elvis ... Elvis was taking selfies . And then we saw this streak of light coming right at us . I thought it was a UFO . It 's not what I remember , Agent Roberts . It 's what I 'm learning now . You 've kept me pretty sequestered . But I can hear the people talking . I can hear the fear in their voices . There weren 't supposed to be survivors , were there ? You thought you could claim catastrophic vehicle failure and all would be fine ? But now the Chinese diplomats are demanding to know what really happened . I wanna see my daughter . - I 'll make a call . - You do that . Right ? - Sir ? We 've got a problem . She remembers the missile . - That 's unfortunate . We have the contingency covered . [ indistinct ] . - Sir , are you sure ... ? - Oh , you have such a good heart . Wyatt . But you have to remember that this , this woman is an abomination . The whole mission ... is an abomination and an act of global hubris . An insult to the creator . The mission is the whole dominion over this life . This earth ! Nowhere is it written that we must spread our seed across this universe ! Activate Sham ! Or do it yourself ! - What the hell are you looking at ? - Good evening , Dr.Vos. It looks like we 're in for a treat tonight . Chicken teriyaki ... and some rice . - But I 'm a vegetarian . - Darn . Well , looks like somebody screwed up the meal orders . - What are you doing ? ! - It would have been a lot easier have you cooperated . - What 's in that needle ? - It 's a little something to help with those memories . - I know about the missile . This is about the missile . Who shot that missile ? - Wrong question , Kathryn . - [ indistinct ] - - And why ? - You wouldn 't understand why ! You 're filled with your faith and technology and worshiping false gods ! Why can 't you die ? ! - Because I am supposed to do something ! It 's not my time . - Stop ! - You 've been lying to me ! You 're never gonna let me see my family again ! You 're never gonna let me go ! - If you leave , you 'll be putting lives into danger ! Your husband 's . Your daughter 's . - They don 't even know I 'm alive , do they ? - No they don 't . Do you really want your little girl to know that her mommy went to Mars and came back a monster ? Stay and we can answer your questions together . - I don 't think so ! - Yes ? - John Voss ? Wyatt Roberts . - I 've got it . - I wanna see your warrant . - Call your lawyer if you want , but we 're taking the laptop with us . - I want a receipt . - Of course . Pope ? - Are you gonna tell me why you 're taking my computer ? - Because we have records of transmissions your wife sent to your daughter that mentioned something strange and wonderful going on . Do you have any idea what that meant ? - Strange and wonderful ? You mean in dreams ? - Dreams ? What dreams ? Kat told Amelia she was having these dreams . That she was swimming a river of stars and galaxies . - Was that code ? - Code ? You gotta be kidding me . Do you think my wife was sending messages in code ? What 's going on here ? How come no one will tell me what happened to Samsara ? There was that one special report and then nothing . - Special report ? I don 't know what you are talking about . - You 're lying . And you have been lying all along . - Lying ? - You , the government , for all I know , the damn Illuminati . Someone has a vested interest in keeping the truth from us . - If you 're looking into technology to save a child , you 're looking in the wrong direction . - Why are Chinese suddenly rattling sabers ? Why have our diplomats been expelled from Beijing ? Why are pundits suddenly rethinking the whole space program ? - Because it 's an obscene waste of money when people right here on earth are quite hungry . And children ... are dying of cancer . - Get out of my house ! - Don 't try to leave . Pope . - Hey girl ! - Hi . - It 's good to see you . - Good to see you . How are you doing ? - I 'm doing fine . I see you went shopping . - Good . - Yes . Check this out . - What 'd you get ? Is this real leather ? - I know , right ? Yeah , it 's so good . And then ... let me show you . So , this material is super , super soft , right ? - Very soft . - Hey ! God ! What were you doing ? - Please ... Forgive me ... Forgive ... give ... give ... - Oh , my god , are you OK ? - I 'm sorry , are you ? - Oh , I 'm sorry , I 'm fine . I 'm sorry . - Hey , she just took your stuff ! - It 's just stuff . She obviously needed it more than I did . Should we order ? - You know , you shouldn 't be touching that with your bare hands . - Afraid there 's some martian virus ? I 'll take my chances . - Ooh ... ah . Ha ! Looks like something you could pick up on the Arizona desert . Like a little bit like home . Did you ever read William Blake in school ? Sure . 'Tyger Tyger , burning bright , ' In the forests of the night ; - I never like that one much , but Algeries of Innocence . 'To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower . Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour . ' - That 's beautiful . - My wife translated all of William Blake 's work . - You didn 't tell me you were married . - My EX wife . She was politically unreliable and I wanted to go to Mars . And now here I am , quoting poetry by a nineteenth century English mystic . - When I was a kid , my mother won a cruise to Australia for four . It was one of those contests where you fill out a form and then forget about it because no one ever wins . - Somebody has to win . - Right ? My mom won . It was a trip for four , so it was me , my parents , and my mother 's best friend , Joy , who was always up for an adventure . And the first night we were at sea , I went out the deck to look at the stars . Even then I knew I wanted to be an astronaut . And I realized I didn 't recognize any of the stars . - I 'd never been in the southern hemisphere before . I knew the constellations were different , but to look up at the sky and not recognize any of the stars was ... - Disorienting ? - More of a reminder that you can 't see all sides of the universe looking at it from one perspective . And if we saw earth from space , that would change everything . I wonder what Newton would allot on this . You know , of ... of us being here . - Building a habitat on Mars is proof that humanity can live on another planet ? He would have been first in line to buy a ticket . And he wouldn 't have minded not coming back . - You betcha . You betcha . - You need help . Hun ? - Oh , no . I 'm ... - Oh ... - Yes . Yes I do . Do you have any shoes ? - Oh ... Let me see . Ah ... These look to be about your size . - Thank you . Thank you so much . I can 't pay you for anything . - Did I ask you for money ? - Oh , I 'm sorry . I ... I ... I 'm just not good at being the one asking for help . I 'm sorry . It 's just ... I just feel out of control . - You think you 're in ... . control ? The more ... tightly you hold on to things , the more they ... seep through your fingers . It 's like ... trying to stop ... time . And you hold on . You know ... My name is Evangeline . Evangeline like the ... poem . - Thank you . - You said that already . We are all in this together . And God knows ... none of us ... will make it out of here alive . [ indistinct ] - Again , thanks everyone for sharing tonight . It was good . You ... look familiar . Have you been here before ? - No . It 's my first time . - Anything to share ? - Not tonight . Just not ready . - Well , take your time . - Thank you . - Hang out . Enjoy the cake and ... coffee . Uh , the coffee 's really good . - Oh really ? - The cakes are kinda stale . - You shouldn 't put all that caffeine in . Did you pick up that bad habit since you got back ? - [ indistinct ] - How are you feeling ? - I feel ... great . - You 're relieved ? - Yeah , I thought I 'd become a monster . - Because you survived . - Now I can sense things . I can do things . I can do everything I wanna do except the thing I wanna do the most . - Hmm .. say you 'll meet her again . You 'll see your baby again . Maybe [ indistinct ] , [ indistinct ] . - Sounds like something Cece would say . That I 'll see Amelia again . I know it . And I know that 's the reason why I 'm still here . But why else ? - Why ? Why ? is the most useless question on the universe . - And yet it is the question we are born asking . - And it 's only answered when we die . - So you know the answer ? Now that you 're dead ? - I know ... that we shouldn 't fear this . As for the rest , your guess is as good as mine . Remember what we saw when we flew away from earth ? Remember how even Robert was moved to poetry ? - Yeah , and Elvis said he was overdosed of ecstasy . - Yeah , well , Elvis ... uh ... - So if a spiritual experience can cause a cognitive shift , why can 't it cause a physical evolution as well ? - Someone just took your picture . Go now . [ indistinct ] . - Yeah , I 'm just not sure now . - Yeah . - Remains to be seen . - Doc has been spotted heading west . - West ? - She 's headed to her house . - We 'll get there first . - Let 's hit it ! Come on , let 's go ! What are you waiting on ? Let 's hit it ! - Oh , god ... I 'm done . What have I done ? - Lost ? Seems kind of silly ... that you can find your way home from Mars and then get lost in your hometown . - Lost . That 's a good word to describe how I feel now . Lost . - You heard what they 're saying about our mission . That it was all ... for nothing . That it cost a fortune and everybody died . - Except I didn 't . - Hmm . An inconvenient truth . You have to tell people why we went to Mars . People think it was to find humanity a new home . - It wasn 't ? - What do you think ? - Well , I think ... I think the real purpose was to look back our the world and see it . Really see it . You know ? The whole of all humanity . No borders , no barriers , just us . That 's what I think . - Exactly . And you can share that message . - I can 't preach to anyone . I 'm not Jesus or Muhammad or Buddha . - Or Neo . But who 's talking about preaching ? We 're talking about showing , not telling . You already know what you can do . You 've already felt it . We 've come so far ... as a species . But somethings ... we get lost . And every so often someone special ... comes along ... to help us get back on our path . Someone who can see ... the bigger picture . That we 're all ... one ... under the sun . - That 's kind of abstract . I 'm not sure people will think a Hallmark card sentiment was worth a bazillion dollars . That it took us to go to Mars and get us back . Well , me back . - Hmm . - But why me ? I 'm not special ! - Oh , come on . You don 't believe that . I know ... how hard you worked to put yourself through school . I know what you sacrificed to train for this mission . If you weren 't special , you would have quit a long ... time ago . But here 's a question : What would humanity pay ... for peace ? - Peace-of-mind , right ? - No . Peace . As in the absence of aggression . The sensation of hostility . The end of conflict . Would that be worth the bazillion dollars it took us to take us to Mars and bring you back ? - You know it would . - You can reveal that . All by yourself , in one hour . - What ? You 're not just dead ; you 're crazy ! One hour ? - Katherine , I 'm a communications guy , right ? I know networks . Right now , humanity is one big mess of individuals acting as if they 're the only ones in the planet , acting with no regard to how their actions affect other people . They 're disconnected . You ... can change that . - Well ... if I can ... I can tap into this ... this power ... I can save a [ indistinct ] . Right ? Right ? I can 't ? I can ... I can save humanity but I can 't save my little girl ? Who made that rule ? - You have to let go of your anger . - Well I am ... I have a right to my anger ! You know , I am angry because my little girl is dying and I have what ? 71 amino acids fizzing in my body and I can [ indistinct ] 70 billion people and I can 't save my little girl ? No ! No ! - Amelia has already made her choice . Now you have to chose . What 's it gonna be ? - It 's too hard . - When has anything ever been too hard for you ? - I 'm on my way to the hospital , to be with my dying daughter over the death of her mother , so I suggest you get the hell out of here . - Mr.Voss , I understand how you must feel . - Oh , you do ? - Your family 's in danger . I need you to go back inside until we access the situation . - No . - Sir , I must insist ... - Hey ! I served in Iraq . I survived the Battle of Fallujah . You think you 're gonna stop me from seeing my dying daughter ? ! Not in my best day . - Sir , what do you want us to do ? - Stay here and wait for the wife . And when she comes back , take her into custody . I 'll be back at the hospital . - OK . - Agent Pope . I believe you 've been looking for me . I 'm Katherine Voss . - How do you know my name ? - I honestly don 't know . - So what ? Is that one of your new abilities ? You 're psychic ? - I guess so . Don 't be scared . I need a ride to the hospital to see my little girl . - I know who hurt you . - You don 't wanna kill me , Eli . You 're not angry at me . You 're mad because your wife wants a divorce and you don 't . You think she 's sleeping with your neighbor but she isn 't . And you love her so much you 're afraid to tell her how angry you are because then she might never speak with you again . So you 're angry at me . But I forgive you . Will you forgive me ? - Forgive you ? - We need to go now , Eli . There 's something I need to do , and I don 't have much time . Well ... Hei ! - You know ... the reason why you can 't remember what happened on Mars is because what happened didn 't happen on Mars . It happened on the way there . - I was wondering when you were going to show up . - Time is a river . - What did I see ? What did I see that caused all this ? - You 've already remembered . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - We were talking about what we were going to say when we stepped out on Mars for the very first time . And you quoted Yuri Gagarin . " The earth is so beautiful . " - Yeah ... The planet is so beautiful . We saw the earth . Out the [ indistinct ] window . It is so beautiful . So blue . So peaceful . - And you thought ... - And I thought . " We are all one on this small , blue planet . " " There are no boundaries , there are no nations , " " it 's just us . " " under the sun . " - I am no astro physicist like some people I know . But I once heard someone say that the unifying principle in all the universe , the glue that put it all together , is love . - " Love makes the world go ' round " ? - Time is running out , Kathryn . A lunatic named [ indistinct ] has claimed responsibility for the explosion on the Sumsara , And has admitted killing the Chinese president three years ago . - Why ? - He left the [ indistinct ] . I did my thesis on the [ indistinct ] never really matters why they do things . - Left ? - Started a [ indistinct ] and then disappeared to avoid getting [ indistinct ] . The PRC has news , Katherine . - Go away . You 're a figment of my imagination . Go . - Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge . - I know . I used to have a t-shirt with that quote printed on it . - A world without war ... You could make it happen . [ indistinct ] [ indistinct ] - I am a figment of my own imagination . A ghost ... walking aimlessly among the living . How can I save the world if I can 't even save my daughter ? - Our greatest fear is not that we are powerless , but that we are powerful . [ indistinct ] - You sound like a fortune cookie . - You 're deflecting ! You know what you have to do . You know why [ indistinct ] this task and the power to complete it ! - Power ... power has only led me to pain ! This universe has made a mistake . - There are no mistakes1 . Only reminders . It 's easy to give up , to fall into despair . It is only when we enjoy do we find it in ourselves to achieve greatness . - But I 'm all alone . I have no one left . - You are not ... alone . - John . Oh my god ! John ? - You guys don 't have that much time . Roberts will be back . - John ... Oh my god ... I thought I 'd never see you again . - They told me you were dead . - Well , they told me that it wasn 't safe to be with you , that I 'd contaminate you or infect you . - We saw Samsara blow up . We saw it on TV , and ... and NASA said there were no survivors . Then they pulled every scrap of footage off the air , they said that it ... it never happened , that it ... it was a mistake , that I must have imagined it . - I 'm so sorry . - I didn 't want to believe it . But we saw it blow up ! We saw it ! - John , there 's something I had to do . That 's the reason I survived this accident . - If you 're here , there has to be a reason . I know you 're part of something bigger than my own understanding . I missed you . - I missed you , too . [ indistinct ] you were gone , but if you haven 't gone , it wouldn 't be the woman that ... I fell in love with . The woman I love . - John ... I 'm not that strong . I 'm not that strong , you know . When Amelia got sick , I felt like my whole world was falling apart . I felt so selfish for leaving , but I just couldn 't sit her and watch her die . So I ran , I ran all the way to Mars . I cannot forgive myself for that . - But I forgive you , Katherine . Amelia forgives you . You need to forgive yourself . Go . Say goodbye to Amelia . Go do what you have to do . - Why did you have to survive ? If you just died , everything would have been fine . But no . You had to give people a miracle , so they could keep putting their faith in technology . We don 't have to save ourselves ! Science will save us ! We don 't have to ... clean up our oceans ! Because we could just move on to another planet . You survived , and that ... was a miracle . Well , I don 't believe in miracles . Look at me when I 'm talking to you ! - I 'm sorry . We were having a moment there . - Is it really you ? - Yes , beautiful . It 's me . - You came home from Mars ! - I did . I promised , didn 't I ? - I had a dream . You took me to a river of stars . We dived and I swam . And there was gasses floating past us like rainbow fish . And we caught them . And petted them . And then we threw them back . And then we danced in the middle ... of a cloud of stars . It was so beautiful . - You 're so beautiful . - Are you crying ? Why are you crying ? - Well , sometimes you see something so precious you just want to hold on to it as long as you can . - Is she in there ? - Yes . Dr.Voss is inside . - She what ? Just showed up here and waltzed in ? - She wanted to speak to her daughter . - I found John Voss in a room . You have something to do with that ? - There 's a reason ... she 's alive , sir . - She got to you . - What if she 's not crazy ? What if we 're the crazy ones ? What if ... what if what we 're doing ... is wrong ? - You 're in my way . - I don 't want to hurt you ... sir . - Shame . I can 't say the same about you . - Don 't be sad ... - I wish ... - What , baby ? What do you wish ? - I heard the nurses talking . - Yeah ? - They 're scared there 's gonna be a war , because the Chinese astronaut burned up . So ... I wish there not be a war . I wish that tomorrow ... everyone would wake up and be happy . And not be mad anymore . - Yeah ? And what about getting well ? Wouldn 't you wish for that ? - No . I think you only get one wish . - Yeah ? And you 'll give up your wish for everybody else ? - I 'd give my life for them . - Yeah ? Is that what you 're doing ? Wyatt , come here . - It 's beautiful ! - Help me show it to everyone . - How ? - Just hold on . It won 't hurt . We are ... all one

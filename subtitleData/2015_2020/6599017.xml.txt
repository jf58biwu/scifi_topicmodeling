 My name is Kathryn ... and this is my daughter Milja . Would you be able to spare some of your crop ? We can offer something in exchange . The real treasure , then . We have legumes ... brassicas . Strong varieties . These could boost your yield . Surely you can spare something ? There 's more than enough . That 's what they all thought . Well then , perhaps ... Perhaps we could stay the night . Inside . Wait . On the bed . On the bed . Wait . Inside . Unbolt that door . Inside . Food first ! Do you have any more chairs ? Sit on the bed . Bags . Don 't move . Stand up . Stand there . Turn your backs to me . Turn around . Sit back down . Where you coming from ? Monaghan . You travelling alone ? Just the two of us . Can we have more ? How long have you been here ? Seven years . Always alone ? I used to live with my brother . He 's dead . On your feet . Inside . I need to ask you something . Don 't come inside her . Shut the door . It 's to shave you . Do you have a toilet ? By the heaps . Use your nose . She likes you . Do you like her ? Would you like to keep seeing her ? The farm 's small for a reason . But we still found it . We could clear more land . More hands to manage it . I 've managed so far . You 've been lucky . It wasn 't luck . Pack your things . Now . He keeps the shells in his front trouser pocket . I can reach them from the bed . Will you have time to load the gun ? I 'll take it outside . By the time he reaches the door , I 'll be ready . Try not to use both shells . Where 's Milja ? Milja ! Make the fire . Get a blade . You need to sterilise it first . It 's in one piece . It has to be cauterised . It 's OK . Get back . Get away from me . Get up . Get inside . Keep that gun down . Shut the door . I 'm sick . Gone , is he ? Going . Better this way ... than through the stomach . Think he has a chance ? Well ... .. no matter now . He 's useful . A third mouth ... on a farm fit for one . And too far gone , anyway . No harm in trying , then . You 're getting sentimental . You 're getting older . He was the one that found me . Help me ! How did your brother die ? He was careless . How many are there ? Six . We have two shells and one bullet . Enough for us . Why are you wasting berries ? Some meat ... With the protein , we might make it . The only thing I 've caught in there walked on two legs . There 's food enough for two . You could shave him tomorrow . Not like that . You have to do it . For both of us . For both of us . I could cook a meal . A meal ? With mushrooms . That would take a few days . We could go away for a while . We 're leaving . I 'm not . It 's too late . You know it 's too late . Did you poison us ? No . Just me . Don 't . Don 't waste the shell . Have you got your knife ? I need you to do it . When I 've finished this . Me and my brother used to raid camps ... .. stealing supplies . We 'd get in ... and get out before anybody knew we were there . One time ... .. my brother saw this girl . He should have left her . But he couldn 't control himself . She screamed . We managed to get outside . They chased us . - They were gonna get the both of us . - Help me ! I did what I had to do . We need to get the seeds before they find them . Augustus . My brother 's name was Augustus . Run . What happens now ? They 'll be taking a vote . It shouldn 't be long . When are you due ? Six months ... I think . Do you know what you 'll call it ? If it 's a boy .

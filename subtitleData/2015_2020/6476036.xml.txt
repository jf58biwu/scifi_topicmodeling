 ABRAHAM : For centuries , mankind has been the dominant species . We 've domesticated animals , locked them up , killed them for sport . But a series of recent events seem to suggest all across the globe , animals have decided , " No more . " And so we were hired , a team of people from different backgrounds , with different specialties : An expert in animal behavior , a journalist , safari guide , foreign intelligence agent and a veterinary pathologist . Our task : To find out what is happening with the animals , why it 's happening , and how to stop it . NARRATOR : Previously on Zoo : I think these lions are communicating with each other , long distance . Are you willing to join me and do something about it ? The global pandemic your father believed was about to emerge , it has arrived . You work for Reiden Global . I know the FBI just issued a warrant for your arrest . Give me the Mother Cell , and I 'll see what I can do about helping you out . The answer 's no . MITCH : I believe that if we introduce the Mother Cell into the DNA of a mutated animal , we could possibly synthesize a cure . But we need an animal who has mutated and has not been exposed to the Mother Cell . Specifically , leopards . There are some areas in Africa where there 's no Reiden activity . - Zambia , Africa . - There is a way to get back to Africa . Oh , no , you 're thinking about Ray , aren 't you ? - Who 's Ray ? - Raymond Joseph Endicott . We need to get out of the country . - Off the books , under the radar . - How soon do you need to leave ? - No ! JACKSON : Chloe ! This one 's all mine . So France , huh ? - Excuse me ? - You 're French ? Yes . [ SPEAKS IN FRENCH ] Yeah , I never been . That 's too bad . My wife ... My late wife , she was always fussing about going . Paris , in particular . Women love Paris , don 't they ? - What 's so great about Paris ? - Your friend was lying to you . - Shut your hole . - Shafer was working for Reiden . - He was lying to you . - This is where you stop . This is where you stop or I drive and I find a deep , deep river someplace and I make you stop in an awful way . It tarnishes my badge , but I 'll get over it , all right ? Do you know what he was doing in Biloxi ? Your friend was on Reiden 's payroll . He was working for the company responsible for the spreading animal problem . The problem that my team is trying to solve . Yeah , I don 't have many friends . I had one . Yeah , and he 's dead . And not only are you scumbums responsible for his death , but now you want to besmirch his good name . I 'm gonna crush your team , starting with Jamie Campbell . You 're crazy . That 's what rage does to a man . [ SCREAMS ] [ GRUNTING ] Ripped By mstoll MITCH : I 'm a little envious of Chloe right now . Nice air-conditioned cell . My man here in Zambia is the real deal . He 'll have the intel on leopard sightings , and he 'll outfit the lot of us . This is rough bush . We need a lot more than a tranq gun . - Thanks , Ray . RAY : You got it . I 'm with you now and I aim to help , all right ? Because ? Come on , say it for me , sport . - Shut up . - One more time . Honestly , I can 't get enough of it . The sooner we find the leopards , the sooner we save the world . Beautiful . Hello . Hello ? Jackson ? JAMIE : What is it ? - You might not want to ... - Oh , my God . Well , that explains why they didn 't answer our radio call . RAY : Damn it . This is my guy . Man with the plan . Looks like he put up a good fight though . JAMIE : Who would do this ? MITCH : Not who , what . - Those are claw marks . - Leopards . This is a slaughter . I mean , they weren 't even feeding . - It 's just ... MITCH : Strange . Yeah , strange is good . Strange tells us we 're on the right track . You guys . This is happening in every continent , every major city . This is not a coincidence . MAN 1 : What would you have us do ? Shoot all the zoo animals ? What about farm animals ? Pets ? My point is , this is a virus , and it 's spreading fast . There is no evidence of a virus . At least they 're starting to pay attention . Which means it 's getting worse . All the more reason for us to get moving . The car outside , you might find some keys on those bodies over there . JAMIE : Are you serious ? They used all our ammo in the fight . Now all we got is this tranq gun . All right , let 's do what we came here to do . [ CHLOE GRUNTING ] [ CHLOE SHOUTS IN FRENCH ] [ PANTING ] [ SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] I 'll find out what 's happening . [ ABRAHAM SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ MAN SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] These leopards we 're after , you think they started mutating before the other animals ? - According to our research , yeah . - I buy that . Africa is the birthplace of civilization . Every great evolutionary leap started here . So let me guess , chui means leopards ? He said that we should turn back . He said that last night , leopards came into their farm and dragged away 12 people . Where is their farm ? Hand me that map . Up here . All right , so this is where he said their farm is . This is where the leopards attacked a few days ago . - And this is where the airport is . JAMIE : Totally random . Yeah , you 'd think they 'd move in a clear direction . Yeah , unless random is part of their plan . When an army wants to take an area , they attack in a haphazard fashion . Causes fear . Rumors of their next attack frightens people enough for them to leave even before the army arrives . Wait , what are you telling me ? Leopards are using military strategy ? MITCH : It 's possible . They 're working as a group . Means they 're thinking as a group . Well , glad we don 't have any real guns then . If the attacks are random , how are we gonna know where to look for them ? I have a feeling the leopards are going to find us . [ DOOR CLANGS ] GASPARD : Bonjour , Miss Tousignant . Alves ? Trust me , nobody knows where you are . No one is coming to rescue you . So how long you are here , that 's entirely up to you . Ooh , la , la . I told them , be gentle . [ DOOR OPENS ] You were trained by the DGSE to withstand interrogation . But included in that training was the knowledge that , at a certain point , even the best agent will break . So why not save us both the trouble and tell me what I want to know ? Where are the rest of your team ? I 'm not gonna tell you anything . As an intelligence analyst , I thought you would be a little more intelligent . Hmm ? They 're presently trying to clean up a mess you made . Perhaps you should let them be . They are the mess we made . They need cleaning up . You can try to hurt me as much as you wish . It 'll do you no good . You are now displaying your naïveté as to how things work . I 'm not going to hurt you . What is that hanging in that tree ? The leopards . Judging from these prints , I 'd say a group of about eight or so . I 've never seen animals do anything like this to humans . We have . Hey , these prints can 't be more than a few hours old . That means we 're getting closer to the leopards . Their den may be around here . Closer ? You wanna get closer ? That suddenly sounds like a really bad idea . We want to find the cure , right ? Let 's go find those leopards . You know , that scent 's gonna scare away the very leopards you 're trying to catch . There 's lots of dangerous animals out here , not just leopards . Better to be safe . Didn 't your father ever take you camping ? I grew up on a farm . Why would I go camping ? - What 's your excuse ? - Nobody ever took me camping . Would you want to be stuck in a tent with moody teenage Mitch ? Fair enough . Hey , no offense , but I would 've had this thing up about 20 minutes ago . It 's all yours . Excuse me . That 's annoying . Well , we all got different skills , don 't we , professor ? Yours is imparting wisdom , advancing science . Mine is saving the animals . All right , there you go . Thank you . Maybe you can help me with something now . See , all this doesn 't make sense to me . Assuming your plan works , assuming you actually catch a live leopard , you shake up a cocktail of their stem cells and a chunk of the Mother Cell you got tucked away in your handy little man bag there . Then what ? Hmm ? Poof ? All the animals are cured ? That 's a little reductive , but , yeah , that is the hope . - Once we administer the cure ... RAY : See , that 's my point . How do you suppose you 're gonna administer the cure , huh ? What , a garden hose ? We are talking about every critter in the world , right ? [ LEOPARD GROWLING ] Well , what we do here is we take things one step at a time . So first , we need to find a cure . Then we 'll worry about how to deliver it . Okay ? MITCH : Six tranq darts . I hope Ray is as good a shot as he says he is . He is . Much as it pains me to say it . I used to love the sound of nature . This is not how the bush should sound . Before , it was something beautiful . Now , it 's something entirely different . [ ABRAHAM SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] That 's what those farm kids were singing today . It 's a very old song . I used to sing it with my brothers . I didn 't know you had brothers . Not anymore . I used to sing Clem to sleep when she was a baby . [ SINGING ] Oh , my darling Oh , my darling Oh , my darling Clementine If the ububa leaves don 't keep the animals away , I 'm sure your singing will . [ BOTH CHUCKLING ] Easy , cowboy . I 'm just gonna go pee . Well , sneak up on us a little bit louder next time , okay ? Give us some warning . Okay . Can I have the tranq gun ? Okay , but be careful . There 's only a few rounds left . Here . Let me go with you . To hold the gun , because you can 't while you ... Come on . Okay . That 's far enough . JAMIE : Here . Stay here . [ LEOPARD GROWLING ] I don 't wanna rush you , but , um , you done yet ? - I can 't go . - What ? Why not ? Can 't pee when there are people around . I 'm 10 feet away from you , in the dark , in a jungle . I can still see you . Move further away . Keep going . How 's this ? [ LEOPARD GROWLING ] Do you hear that ? Pee faster . How do you do that even ? Where 's Mitch ? He 's escorting Jamie to pee . It 's not your watch for another hour . Couldn 't sleep . I 'm sure she 's fine , Jackson . I 'm sure she 's fine too . And when we return home with the cure , we 'll set everything straight . We 'll be heroes . I never cared to be a hero . I just wanted a quiet , simple life . Which is what we had . Yes , we did . So how in the hell did we let all this happen to us ? Anyway , I 'm sure she 's fine . Do you recognize this apartment ? Don 't do this . Good . She has nothing to do with any of this . Watch the screen , please . That is Tomas . He is dreadful . He prides himself on it . The feed is live , of course , and we are expecting your sister to come any moment . I know . It 's terrible . And yet wildly effective , no ? She should be on the Metro about now on her way home from work . Fine . As you know , my sister betrayed me with my fiancé . Perhaps , I will enjoy this a little . I suspected you would attempt that tact . I can assure you , no one , not the lowest scum of the earth , deserves the pain Tomas is capable of serving up . JACKSON : Hey , wake up . - What is it ? - There 's something out there . Just saw something zip by . Throw me that box of tranq darts , will you ? If it is a leopard , I can handle it . Ray , you stay here . We 're safer together . Right . I got this . Nothing there . Looks like we live to die another day . - Ray ! JAMIE : Oh , my God . [ SNARLING ] JAMIE : Oh , my God . Hey , man , look out . Jamie , those glow sticks you have . - What ? - Your glow sticks . Bring them here . Mitch , behind you . [ SHOUTS ] Oh , my God . Come on , let 's go . Go ? Go where ? I tagged one of the leopards with a glow stick . We can track it . - Where are the keys ? - Jackson , Ray had the tranq gun . We don 't have any weapons . We need a plan ! We have a plan , okay ? This is it . We follow the leopards . That 's our best chance . What else you wanna do ? Stay here and wait for them to come back ? Hey , right up there . Up ahead , on the right . We 're on the right track . Maybe somebody should say something about him . Ray . I mean ... nobody should die without words being spoken , right ? Ray was obnoxious , loud , and stubborn , but he was passionate . And he cared more about animals on this Earth than any man I 've ever met . JACKSON : Looks like the trail 's run out . We lost him . Okay , team . What now ? JACKSON : Let 's make camp . We can pick up the trail when it gets light out . [ DOOR RATTLES ON VIDEO ] Ah . She 's home early . NATHALIE [ ON VIDEO IN FRENCH ] : [ NATHALIE SCREAMING ON VIDEO ] NATHALIE [ IN ENGLISH ] : No ! No ! [ IN FRENCH ] - I will kill you . GASPARD : I know that you would . But right now , the only way to help poor Nathalie is if you tell me where the rest of your team is . Put it to her ear . [ IN FRENCH ] [ IN ENGLISH ] Say it . Say it . [ IN FRENCH ] NATHALIE [ IN ENGLISH ON VIDEO ] : No , no , no . GASPARD : Keep going . [ NATHALIE SCREAMING ON VIDEO ] ABRAHAM : We lost the tranq gun , so we 'll make our own . It 's not quite ketamine , but it should do the trick . The locals have used the root for hundreds of years to get drunk , so hopefully , it 's enough to knock out a leopard . That 's the most disgusting thing I ever smelled in my life . MITCH : Okay . Whoa , easy . You sure about that ? It 's for science . Tingles . Hope it does more than that to the leopard . JACKSON : Stop the truck . Right up there . You see those trees with the rocks ? The rocks along the base . Yes . Looks like their den . If we can isolate one leopard , we may have a chance . What if we can 't ? You ready ? After you . - If they don 't come back ... - Yeah , let 's just not think about that . These tracks are fresh . They 're leading away from the den . Well , if they 've gone out for a hunt , they won 't be back till nightfall . We can watch from the car until they return . Or we can wait right here . All right ? If the first one comes back alone , we 'll surprise it . What ? Ray didn 't have to die . What 's that supposed to mean ? Ray didn 't have to die . We should have had a better plan . No , we should have had any plan at all . You think I 've been reckless ? You 've already said that . - No one 's coming up with any ideas . - That 's because you didn 't let them . - Man , that 's ... - I don 't want any more excuses . And I 'm not questioning your motives , but if there 's no one left alive to help you ... [ LEOPARD GROWLING ] That 's a female . They must have left her alone . If that 's the case , then maybe she has a cub inside the den . A cub would be a lot easier to deal with than an adult . But if she does have a cub , she 'll only be gone for a moment . [ UNDERBRUSH RUSTLING ] The cub . Let 's go make the cure . What happened to the bridge ? The rope 's been chewed . We 're going to have to drive the long way around the river . If we drive the long way around the river , we have to drive through the Ndube Army 's territory . JAMIE : The Ndube Army ? I 'm guessing that 's not a real army , right ? Far from it . Think of a African Hells Angels . Except instead of motorcycles and leather jackets , they have rifles and machetes . There 's no other way . Course there isn 't . MITCH : Hey , we sure this is the best plan ? We should just drive fast , get the hell through here , not worry about the engine noise . No . We should stay quiet . [ PHONE RINGING ] What is that ? MITCH : It 's Chloe 's phone . Must 've left it in my pack . Hello ? MAN [ OVER PHONE ] : Who is this ? This is Jackson Oz . I 'm a friend of Chloe 's . Who is this ? My name is Pascal Cransac . I work with Chloe at the DGSE . If you know where she is , you need to tell me right away . She 's been arrested . She 's fine though . She 's safe . She 's ... She 's in FBI custody . - No , she 's not . JACKSON : What do you mean ? - How do you know that ? - It 's my job . The FBI agent who was escorting her back to New York City was found dead on the side of the road , murdered . Now Chloe 's missing . What 's going on ? She 's wanted for the murder of a second agent . She didn 't kill that agent . I know that and you know that , but whoever did do the killing ... Has Chloe . PASCAL : If you hear anything from her , please call me on this number . Yes , I will . Of course . You do the same . - What is it ? - That fed , Brannigan , he was killed . Reiden . It had to be Reiden . If that is the case , then what have they done with Chloe ? [ NATHALIE SOBBING ON VIDEO ] NATHALIE [ ON VIDEO ] : No ! Oh , this is good . You 're going to enjoy this . [ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING , THEN NATHALIE SCREAMING ON VIDEO ] Okay . Stop . - I 'll tell you , but just make him stop . - You first . They 're in India . A small town in Rajasthan . - Why India ? NATHALIE [ ON VIDEO ] : No , no . They 're looking for a specific group of leopards , unaffected by Reiden chemicals . You 've poisoned the animals everywhere , but not there . Thank you . Now , tell him to get the hell away from my sister . If you 're lying to me , your sister dies . They 're in India . [ ALL SHOUTING ] [ MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] - What is he saying ? - I have no idea . JACKSON : No , no . No . JAMIE : Jackson ! Don 't hurt him , all right ? Take me . Take me . - Don 't hurt him . ABRAHAM : It 's okay . They 're not going to hurt me . They think we have money or that we are worth money . - Who would want to pay for us ? - We know that , but they don 't . What do we do ? We have no guns , we have no money , we have nothing . MITCH : We have him . What are we gonna do , sic a kitten on them ? The needle on Abe 's spear , hand it to me . [ MEOWING ] JACKSON : Hey , what are you doing ? What ... ? - No , no . Jamie ! - Hey ! [ JAMIE SCREAMING , THEN MITCH GRUNTS ] What do we do ? I don 't know yet . They 're not taking Jamie for ransom . No . JACKSON : If we get an opening , you take out the driver , we 'll get Jamie . We just need a diversion . [ SNARLING , THEN ALL SCREAMING ] [ GUNFIRE AND ALL SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] - Jamie . Come on . - Come on , come on . - Go ! Come on ! - It worked . You lied to me . - I did not . - I checked all the flights into India . Your friends were not on any of them . They 're fugitives , they cannot travel commercial . We paid for passage on a cargo plane . There were three undocumented planes that landed in Rajasthan in the last 24 hours , I checked them too . Perhaps they changed their plan . No , they 're sticking to their plan . It 's just not the one you told me . And now , your sister will die because of a useless lie . You will not kill her . You can 't . Because if you do , you will have no leverage with me . I 'm never gonna tell you what it is you need to know . You 're right , of course . Take her left hand . Use the dullest blade you have . I 'll come back in 10 minutes . Perhaps you will have changed your mind by then , before we move on to Nathalie 's right hand . That was great what you did back there . - What ? - What you did with the cub . - What ? - Mitch stuck the cub with a needle . His pain sent a distress call . It was just like the lions in L.A. They communicate over long distances . - Oh , that was you ! - I just put their mutation to good use . This little guy saved our lives . We did it , rafiki . Man , you saved my life . I think ... What ... What happened ? - It 's okay . - What happened ? Oh , my God . Jackson , you 've been shot ! - Let me see , let me see . - I 'm fine . All right , here . Keep that over the wound . Press down , press down . ABRAHAM : Oh , my ... - Gotta get him to a hospital . Hold on , rafiki . Hold on . You are going to make it , rafiki . Hold on . Oh , no , no , no . [ GUNSHOT ] Listen to me carefully . We don 't have much time . I 'm on your side . Things were never supposed to happen like this . It got out of control . I want ... I need to help fix this . Let me help you . Tell me where Jackson and the others are . Tell me , so we can help them . This is another trick to get me to talk . No , it 's not . But I 'm risking everything to be here . I need to know you 'll trust me . [ BANGING ON DOOR ] GASPARD : Open up ! DELAVANE : Look at me . Look in my eyes . You 're good at this . Look at me and decide if I 'm telling you the truth . GASPARD : Unlock this door now ! DELAVANE : What 's it gonna be ? Shoot that bastard dead , then maybe we 'll talk . DELAVANE : We need to go . My sister , you have to help her . You have ... I already have . [ MAN SPEAKING IN FRENCH ON VIDEO ] DELAVANE : They 'll take her to the hospital . We can call from the road . If you 're lying to me , I will kill you . - They 're in Zambia . - Let 's go finish what we began . Looks like we 're 10 miles from the hospital . How 's he doing ? ABRAHAM : Not so good . That 's the third one in an hour . MITCH : Yeah , that 's the same pattern we saw when we were in Boston . [ COUGHING ] We 're close , my friend . The blood , the blood is coming through the shirt . Keep pressure on it , nice and even . Don 't let him pass out . Maybe we should pull over . Lot of things I can handle in a pinch . Kind of surgery he needs , not one of them . [ LEOPARD GROWLING ] The cub is impatient , rafiki . You need to give him a name . Maybe a musical name , considering how much noise he makes . Perhaps Bono or Bowie ? JAMIE : What 's going on ? Where are they going ? Everybody 's leaving town . Could be a million reasons . [ JACKSON COUGHS ] You 're worried about your team . I need to talk to them . Reiden will be looking for us . They 'll be monitoring cell conversations . If they find you , they can have an interception team wheels up in minutes . Look , I don 't even know if Jackson found the leopard , or if they made the cure . Or if they 're even alive . I understand . But if this goes well , we 'll have the entire weight of the United States government behind us . - Maybe you should do it yourself . - No . - You have one thing that I do not . - What 's that ? You 've looked it in the eye . This animal pandemic . You 've even managed to get the better of it once or twice . There 's one person here who can make them believe . And that 's you , Chloe . [ PEOPLE SCREAMING ] - Grab the electroporator . - Oh , my God . That 's why they 're all leaving . We need to get inside now . Here . - Hey ! - Open the door ! It 's an emergency ! My friend needs a doctor ! MAN : The hospital is closed . Did you hear what I said ? We are abandoning the hospital . - You have to go elsewhere . - We don 't have time . - This man 's been shot . - I can 't help . - I suggest you drive him to Nyanga . - That 's four hours at least . I have lost a dozen colleagues and more patients than I can count . I am sorry , but I cannot help you . You will help him ! You understand me ? You will help ... The last ambulance leaves in an hour . I will do the surgery , but beyond that , you are on your own . Thank you . Three units of O-negative and find some morphine . It started at the edge of town . The lions came first , then the leopards . When did the attacks begin ? Two days ago . They attacked the young and the elderly first , then hospitals where they were taken for treatment . - It 's as if they were ... - Thinning the herd . People are terrified . They 're abandoning the city . I 've never seen anything like this . MAN [ ON PA ] : Evacuation busses will be ... No ! [ PEOPLE SCREAMING ON PA ] I 'm sorry . You can 't come with us . Wait . Be strong , rafiki . You may want this . Thank you . The hematology lab should have what we need to extract this little guy 's stem cells , formulate a cure . Hurry , Mitch . He 's getting scared . There . Third floor . We 're heading to Hematology . Come on . Stay behind me . [ METAL CLANGS ] A single set of paw prints . Look , the teeth went straight through the bone . That means leopards . [ ANIMAL GROWLING ] Which way is Hematology ? That way . JAMIE : Come on , little guy . Let 's go . I would argue that the fearless and aggressive behavior witnessed in these animals is , without question , the direct result of an airborne virus . He 's completely wrong . A single-stranded RNA virus , not that unlike canine distemper . You are their one chance to hear the truth . They 're scientists . Mitch should be talking to them . No , you don 't need Mitch . You 've picked up enough over these last weeks . MAN : There is only one logical solution : Identifying and destroying these animals that are infected . Thank you very much . Thank you , Dr. Brett Schneider . Mr. Delavane . [ AUDIENCE MURMURING ] JAMIE : If they 're out there , I don 't hear them . MITCH : Okay , pal , I 'm gonna need one of your teeth , so I can extract some stem cells . Hand me that rubber heart over there . Why ? MITCH : Because . No need to hurt him if we don 't have to . So I 'll just take this , rub a little flavor on it . Here you go . ABRAHAM : I see . You 're going to let the cub remove its own tooth . Exactly . So , uh , assuming I can formulate a cure , we 're gonna need an animal we can test it on . Even if the cure works , wild animals still act wild . We 're going to need a domesticated one . That way we have a clear behavioral baseline . Guys , don 't open this door until I return . What ? No , you ... Abe . I 'm going to be okay . JAMIE : Be careful . You too . CHLOE : My name is Chloe Tousignant . And up until four weeks ago , I was an analyst for the DGSE . My focus was on terrorism . Human terrorism . But I have come to believe that the most serious threat to our survival now comes from the animal kingdom . My team has discovered that there is a genetic mutation throughout the animal kingdom . How can you possibly account for a mutation , given the absence of antigenic drift ? CHLOE : I don 't know what that means . But I do know that a virus brings other symptoms . These animals are healthy and killing them is not the answer . What we 're dealing with is a mutation . Interspecies ? That 's ridiculous . Most of the animals display something called the defiant pupil . An environmental event of global proportions is happening . My team has risked their lives to prove it . The animals have developed a biological imperative to destroy us . If they continue to attack our technology , which they have done . If they continue to develop interspecies communication , which they have done . If they no longer see us as apex predators , which they do not . If all of this continues , the balance of nature will collapse and we will be facing a mass extinction event . - A mass extinction event ? - Yes . Okay , well , I 've had enough of this . Please . My team is in Africa and they need your help . We need your help . MITCH : So ... we carted this thing halfway around the world . About time we used it . This is insane . I mean , this thing has to work for any good to come out of all of this . I mean , my mom dying , and ... Or maybe that was a really stupid thing to say . I 'm sorry . What 's it like being human ? Oh , my God . Mitch , here 's a tooth . - You 're kidding me . Already ? - Yeah . MITCH : All right . Bet you never thought we 'd be saving the world with a tooth and a rubber heart . I 've been looking for you . How 's Jackson ? He 'll sleep for another hour or two . Check on him then . He 's on the second floor , in post-op . As soon as he wakes , start the antibiotic . The other is for pain . We are gathering the last of the patients . Stay away from the animals . There will be no one left to help you . Thank you , doctor . [ MACHINE BEEPING ] [ IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ GROWLING ] CHLOE : Hi . I got here as soon as I could . - You didn 't have to . - Of course . I was worried . Yeah , well , I 'm stubborn , right ? Takes more than a bullet to stop me . A bullet , an army of animals , evil men trying to kill us . Yeah . We 've been through a lot . Yeah , we have . When they were ... wheeling me into the room , I was thinking about you . [ SCREAMS ] [ WOMAN SOBBING AND SCREAMING ] God , forgive me . I have not been a religious man . But if you get us out of this , I promise that will change . Just give me a sign . [ DOG BARKING ] [ TIRES SCREECH ] Hey . Easy . - Easy . MAN : I 'm sorry . - I 'm so sorry . - Hey . Bacco 's very sick . It is enough . No more . - No , no , no . - Stay back . My brother , please , please . Let me take Bacco . I think there is a way I can save him . I 've tried . All of my neighbors have shot their animals . - I 'm the last . - Then let me help him . It is a terrible world where a man has to shoot his own dog . Let me help him . If I cannot , I will do it myself . Come on , Bacco . Come on . You 're coming with me . Hey . Undo the chain , quickly . [ SCREAMING ] Shh . Shh . It 's okay , it 's okay , it 's okay , I got you . It 's gonna be okay , all right ? I 'm gonna get you out of here . [ SCREAMING ] [ SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] It 's okay , it 's okay . Tell him I don 't understand . Wait , no , no , no . [ JACKSON SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] - Your brother 's out there ? - Mm-hm . Your brother 's in there ? Good news is we got some viable stem cells here . So our little friend has done his part . He 's crying so much . You don 't think it 's a call , do you ? Why don 't you try closing the bag ? Maybe he shares my aversion to hospitals . Is that why you dropped out of med school ? No . I never liked hospitals . But I think it was the patients that finally did me in . Will you hand me one of those cuvettes over there ? - Which one ? - The square tube with the lid on it . I didn 't hate the patients . I just ... hated their pain . Their tears . And their families ' tears . You shut down your emotions for long enough , you don 't want to spend all day with somebody else 's . Does it bother you when I talk about my mother ? It did . When we first met . But I 'm okay with it now . I 've actually learned a lot from you , Jamie Campbell . How 's that for a compliment ? I 'll take what I can get . Is this gonna work ? In theory . So there 's something I got to say . And I better say it now before this whole thing goes south . I want to thank you . For dragging me into this insanity . - You don 't have to thank me . - And I want to thank you for giving me the courage to save my daughter . And for reminding me that ... That it 's okay to feel and ... Look , I know you couldn 't save your mother , but truth is , you kind of saved me . [ MACHINE BEEPS ] All right . Well , here we go . This is it . - Hope to God we were right . - I have to find Jackson . [ LEOPARD SNARLS ] Mitch , wait , the Mother Cell . Forget it . Let 's go . - What 's happened ? - The leopards . They came after the cub . I know it sounds crazy , but maybe that 's what those birds were doing . Abe , we lost the Mother Cell . And the cure ? This is it . It 's all we got . One shot , maybe two . Okay . I found a dog and I put him in one of the patient rooms . - If this doesn 't work ? - There 's only one way to find out . [ BARKING ] First , the birds . Now the leopards . It 's no coincidence . They 're after the cub . All right , this is it . No room for mistakes . Ready ? One ... two ... three . Well , how long does it take to work ? I don 't know . [ PHONE RINGING ] - Hello ? Who is this ? CHLOE : Hey . It 's Chloe . How is everyone ? Chloe , oh , my God . Are you okay ? CHLOE : I 'm fine . I 'll explain everything later . - We 're fine . We found a cub . CHLOE : Great . What 's that sound ? - Where are you ? JAMIE : We 're at a hospital in Harare . We 're actually testing the cure right now . Wait , where are you ? Washington . Why are you testing it in a hospital ? Listen , Chloe , JAMIE : something happened . Jackson got hurt . He 's going to be fine , but ... - Where 'd you get this ? - It 's clean . I borrowed it . - I told you not to do that , Chloe . - It doesn 't matter anymore . They didn 't believe me . This was the one thing I can do to help . And I failed . - I 'm sorry . MAN : Miss Tousignant . Mr. Delavane . Would you come with us , please ? Your brother 's out there ? [ BOY WHIMPERING ] Okay . Okay . Here we go . Here we go . Here we go . Here we go . Okay . Okay . Okay . [ SNARLING ] [ BARKING ] If it was gonna work , we 'd have seen some evidence by now . Sorry , guys . This is all my fault . - It 's no one 's fault . - Yeah . I 'm the one who told you all that the leopard cub was the answer . I 'm the one who said the Mother Cell was the key to the cure . That was just a theory . Not even a theory . Half a theory . Now 's not the time for self-pity . It didn 't work . Tell me why . Okay . Should I start with the fact that I 'm not a geneticist ? Or should I start with the fact that somehow I got it into my brain that a completely discredited scientist by the name of Robert Oz was anything other than certifiably insane ? Ancient history . Tell me why you failed today . - Easy , Abe . He tried . - Stop . Let him speak . Tell me why you failed . I don 't know . Why don 't you tell me , genius ? Maybe the Mother Cell was contaminated . But it 's hard , organic substance . So that 's highly unlikely . Maybe the ... The cub 's gene didn 't mutate naturally like we thought it did , but there is no way that it traveled far enough to be exposed to Reiden , so that 's a big fat no . If my hypothesis is sound , and none of the elements were contaminated , then I don 't know , maybe it 's the ... - Maybe it was the delivery system . - The delivery system ? Yeah . The injection . The needle . Maybe the needle was contaminated . Or ... Or what ? Intramuscular injections usually disseminate quickly , but it 's possible that ... It 's possible it never even made it out of the dog 's flank . And if it didn 't make it out of its flank , that means it didn 't get to the brain . And maybe that 's it . Maybe we need to introduce it orally . Maybe we need to do that before the cub 's pack finds us . JAMIE : Do we have enough left ? We 're gonna find out . And , uh ... don 't think I don 't recognize what you just did there . [ BARKING ] Sorry , buddy . We need you one more time . - You got him ? - Yeah . Yeah . Mitch , I don 't know . I don 't think it 's working . Good boy . Good boy . We better find Jackson . We got to get this stuff home . Sorry for the cloak-and-dagger . We haven 't been properly introduced . My name is Amelia Sage . Those scientists didn 't believe you , but I do . And so do the people who matter . Jackson ? Jackson ? Abe . Abe . How are you , man ? I was so worried . I 've said some things over the last few days . What you said , you were right . That little boy in there , the only thing that mattered to him was his brother . And I 've been a lousy brother . I made some dangerous choices . You tried to give your life for me . It was a dangerous choice , but a good brother . The cure ? It worked . You were right . - We got to get out of here . - The lobby 's this way . [ LEOPARD GROWLING ] Oh , my God . Don 't move . Do we run ? No . If we do , they 'll take us down . [ GLASS SHATTERS ] MAN : Tranq them ! MAN 1 : Secure . MAN 2 : Unit two secure ! MAN 1 : Extract ! MAN 3 : Lock it down . Secure this perimeter . DELAVANE : How long have you known about the problem ? Let 's just say that two weeks ago this room didn 't exist . Many of the things you said to the working group corroborate my team 's discovery . The ocular change , for example . - You call it the ... - Defiant Pupil . We call it the Delta Determinate . It 's an anomaly of the Pax-6 gene , but a rose , by any other name . We didn 't know about the gene . We didn 't have the resources . Well , you did just fine without them . My team 's just started to research this problem . Your team is already close to a cure . Resources are the enemy of imagination . Einstein ? Delavane . Well , Mr. Delavane , you 'll be happy to hear that instead of facing criminal charges , your team is about to become heroes . Hopefully , the kind of heroes that can save the world . You 're not alone . Not anymore . Not that we 're not incredibly grateful , but where did you guys come from ? MAN : We 're the 74th Special Tactics Squadron . Our orders are to get you out of here . Okay , listen , there were two others with us . - They 're still ... - Look , Jackson . You look like hell . [ CHUCKLES ] Thanks . Hey , listen , up there with me , there were three kids . Already on their way to Nyanga . We 'll track down their parents . How 'd you know we were here ? All I 'm authorized to say is your location was provided by a French national . We 're gonna get you to Johannesburg and from there on a flight to D.C. I made a promise . Can you spare two men to take him back home ? You serious ? Yeah . Go on . Let 's move . - Let 's go , let 's go . - Yeah . You know , I made a great many promises to God in Zimbabwe . You gonna keep them ? I think all but one . Did it involve women ? No , it involved hamburger . And it was made in haste on your behalf . I think you 'll be making your own promises from now on . No , no , no . As soon as we land , hamburger , two cold beers , not negotiable . Please tell me that after everything we 've been through , you guys aren 't seriously gonna eat a hamburger . Oh , I 'm eating the hamburger . How 's the cub ? He ate half my dinner and fell asleep . Would you mind watching him for a sec ? - Hi . - Hi . I was just pilfering some of these adorable little bottles that haven 't grown up yet . Would you like one ? I would like nothing more . Well ... Well , what ? How many animals do you think have nearly eaten us ? Um , well , to be fair to them , they wouldn 't have eaten us . They 'd have just killed us . That 's right . So we did pretty good , right ? Yeah . Well , considering we didn 't have ... MAN [ ON PA ] : Ladies and gentlemen , this is your captain . We 've been informed that due to some unusual migratory behavior , this airspace has been closed . - We 've been diverted to ... - What migratory behavior ?

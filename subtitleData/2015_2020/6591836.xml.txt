 Previously on " The 100 " ... My brother is on the wrong side . [ Gunshot ] Bellamy : O. , I am so sorry . You 're dead to me . [ Moaning ] A.L.I.E. : You wanted your memories back . Here they are . No ! I submit ! Abby : I want to talk to Raven . Raven 's in the City of Light . No . No , no , no , no , no ! No ! Stop ! Jaha : If you want to save Raven , all you have to do is take the key . [ Hiss ] A.L.I.E. : He 's taking Raven . Jaha : Find Jasper Jordan . Bring him here . [ Tires screech ] Clarke . Get in ! Mom . A.L.I.E. : As soon as Raven wakes and I see her surroundings , we will find them . When we do , we 'll find the rest of their friends . Now that Arkadia has fallen , we 'll move on to stage two . Jasper , please talk to me . I saved your life . It 's more than you deserve . My mother let them shoot at me . I can see the appeal . Stop talking and look for the cave . Sinclair said it would be around here somewhere . Monty : I don 't understand it , either . It 's something about those chips . Sinclair : We 'll know soon enough . Be ready . Bellamy : O. , wait . You can 't just leave . Watch me . You heard what Jasper said on the radio . Arkadia is not safe . What Jasper said sounds insane . Pike 's gone . I can handle myself . Grounders burn their dead . Bellamy : I know that , and then what ? Where you gonna go ? You don 't get to ask me that . What more do I have to do to prove that I am on your side ? Bring Lincoln back . Turning Pike in does not make you one of the good guys , Bellamy . You did that to save me , not because what you thought Pike was doing to the Grounders was wrong . The Grounders were starving us out . Because you massacred an army that was sent to protect us . That army could 've attacked us at any time , and you know it . But they didn 't attack . You did that . You were hurting , and you lashed out because that 's what you do . There are consequences , Bell . People get hurt . People die , your people . Monroe 's dead . Lincoln is dead . Miller : They 're here . Jasper : Need your help ! We have to get her inside before she wakes up . Bellamy : Were you followed ? Jasper : Maybe . I ... I don 't know . Give her here . Get to the ridge . Radio if you spot anyone following . Harper , we 'll stay here on watch . Clarke : Octavia , come on . We need you . Clarke : Clear some space . What the hell happened to her ? Jasper : I told you on the radio . Raven is not Raven anymore . None of them are . Jasper : Jaha has been chipping everyone . Clarke : Jasper 's right . I 've seen it with my own eyes . I don 't need your help , all right ? Bellamy : Just take it easy and explain . Jaha is using the chips to control everyone . You swallow it , and it changes you . You forget who you are , and then you see this thing A.L.I.E. , only she 's not really there . She made Raven slit her own wrists . She was trying to get it out of her head . I was trying to help her , but ... Sinclair : Ok , so let 's help her now . Did she say how ? She was working on building something . She needed one of our old wristbands , but Jaha destroyed all of them . Wait a second . Does it look like this ? There it is ... Not exactly . Version two of my program . Find out where you are now . Clarke : Don 't let her get away ! Hey ! It 's just woods . - I can 't see anything . No . - Stop . I need to know your location . Find a landmark . Let me go ! Jasper : If Raven finds out where we are , so will A.L.I.E. She 'll come for her . [ Hiss ] Reaper stick , last dose . We have to go . Why ? A.L.I.E. doesn 't know where we are . Because I know where we can get a wristband . I 'll talk to her . I 'll go with you . I thought you said she was a friend . We 'll handle it . Just stay here . Skaikru is not welcome here , Wanheda . Niylah , what 's wrong ? Sinclair : She 's waking up ! Hurry . We have to get her inside . Is your father here ? My father 's dead , part of an army killed by your people while trying to protect you . - Niylah , please . - I said no . We haven 't got time for this . Move . Move ! Get her in there . Monty : I told you , my mom was here . If she was chipped , A.L.I.E. would know . Clarke : That 's why we 're putting her in the back . Through there . All right . Clarke : Tie her to the bed . It 's ok . Hold her . It 's ok . It 's ok now . We need to know where you are . - Where the hell am I ? - Hold her ! - Let me go ! - Got her ? Hold her ! Let me go ! - No ! - Raven , stop fighting . Her hands ! Tie her down ! Why is it always me ? Octavia : Sinclair , I need your help . Go , go ! Monty : Ok , Jasper . Faster . Faster . Let me go ! - Raven ... - Come on . There . I 've got it . Raven : No ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go ! How the hell do we get that thing out of her head ? Working on it . Raven : Untie me ! Untie me ! I got this . - I 'll be right here . - Raven : No ! Niylah , we didn 't have a choice . Our friend can 't see you or this room until she 's better . Why ? It 's hard to explain . Try . Just trust me when I tell you it 's important . Trust you after what Skaikru did ? That wasn 't us . I 'm sorry about your father . We all are . What do you want from me , Clarke ? Last time I was here , you had one of our wristbands . We need it now to save our friend . Any why should I help you ? Because I know you won 't let an innocent girl suffer . Stay here . You ok ? Fine . Niylah said we can work in here . So how do we do this ? We think Raven wanted to use this wristband to generate an EMP , which is freakishly brilliant . Meaning what ? Sinclair : A targeted electromagnetic pulse could destroy the chip 's circuitry . Uh , we could use this to send an EMP along Raven 's own nervous system . Just need to reverse the polarity , wire for external input and attach a battery . But what would that do to her ? Uh , EMPs don 't affect our bodies , but I don 't know the mechanics of how this chip integrates with her brain . Bellamy : This was Raven 's plan . She wouldn 't do it if it was gonna destroy her brain . Depends how bad she wanted it out . Sinclair : Regardless , without an electromagnet this is just talk . Where do we get one ? The Ark . Every station had a pulsed inductive thruster for maneuvering . Bellamy : Arkadia is out of the question . It 's too dangerous . You heard them . We use the Dropship . It has P.I. thrusters just like the Ark . That 's good . Ok . - I 'll go salvage a magnet . - Uh , no . You should stay with Raven and figure out how this thing works . I 'll take the rover , be back by the time you finish the device . I 'll go with you . Don 't . With marginally more slack , you could reach those knots . Come on . Don 't ... don 't do that . Raven ... what are you doing ? [ Snap ] There is no pain in the City of Light . Guys ? Guys ! - Stop her . - Jasper , get that side . - Stop . - She 's reopened her wounds . Get away from me . Get away from me . She 's gonna bleed to death . I need bandages . I got her . Bellamy , take her wrists . Raven , stop fighting us . [ Growling ] A.L.I.E. , A.L.I.E. , A.L.I.E. ! I believe ... I know you can hear us . Why are you doing this to her ? Let her go . I 'll let her go when you give me what I want . The technology that Clarke carries , it belongs to me . No way . Clarke , just give it to her . [ Growling ] Clarke ! If you let Raven die , you 'll never get it . Let them help you . Untie her wrists . Hold her steady . [ Creaking ] Clarke , she 's never gonna stop trying to get away . We can 't let her hurt herself again . Someone has to stay with her . I 'll be first watch . We 'll take turns . You don 't give the orders , Clarke . Guess he doesn 't forgive you for murdering his girlfriend . Bellamy : Jasper , take a break . [ Exhales ] You ok with her coming back after all this time , taking over ? She 's trying to save Raven . Guess she thinks Raven 's worth saving . Lucky for her . Let 's get yourself together , Jasper . You can 't let your anger get in the way of what we have to do here . You know , that 's funny coming from you . When you 're angry , people die . Just ask that girl over there . [ Tool clatters ] [ Door opens ] Thank you . Do you ever see their faces ? What ? Of all the people you 've killed . Heh . I know what you 're doing , but you can 't get to me , A.L.I.E. , so don 't even bother . It 's not A.L.I.E. , Clarke . It 's Raven , and I 'm not trying to get to you . I 'm ... I 'm just trying to tell you the truth because no one else will . Everywhere you go , death follows . You always want to save everyone . What you don 't realize is , you 're the one we need saving from . Wells is dead because you couldn 't see Charlotte was a basket case . Finn is dead because you broke his heart and then slid a knife into it . Hell , I bet you got Lexa killed , too . Shut up . And then there 's dear , old Dad . I said , shut up . Your mom 's in here with me , Clarke . She told me you tried to convince him not to go public about the fact the Ark was dying . Guess you should 've tried harder . His blood is on your hands , too . Shut up ! You can hide behind the selfless martyr act . We see you for what you really are ... poison to anyone who gets close . [ Spits ] You 're done , A.L.I.E .. You hear me ? - We 're gonna fry you . - Hey ! Hey ! Come on . Come on . - Get off . - Stop ! No ! Bellamy : Just calm down . Well done . To fry ... to cook over direct heat , to destroy circuitry with excessive current . They must be building the EMP . It 's what I was trying to do . They would need an electromagnet . Where would they get one ? They 're going to the Dropship . Then so are we . [ Parking brake clicks ] Who 'd have thought it 'd be good to see the Dropship ? It 's not . I heard you tell Bellamy you 're leaving . Is that true , after everything we 've been through ? Yeah . Octavia , we 're your people . We were sent down together . We survived together . Lincoln was my people . I 'm not Trikru . I 'm not Skaikru . I 'm nothing . You 're one of the Hundred . Not anymore . [ Click ] I let her get to me . You don 't say . Take a break . I 'll let her beat me up for a while . Jasper : Truth hurts , huh ? I 'm sorry . What ? I never wanted to hurt Maya . I never wanted any of this . I had to save our people . I was going to save everyone . I wish you could 've . Shove your regret up your ass . [ Whimpers ] I had a hell of a time prying open the subassembly , but I got it . [ Snap ] Octavia ! [ Thump ] Oh , Monty . Thank God . - Mom ? - Oh ... I 'm pretty sure I lost them in the woods . Did you see anyone ? They 're everywhere . You got away ? I had to find you . How could you turn me in ? I would never do that . Mom , what was Dad 's favorite color ? We don 't have time for this . We can 't stay . Everyone knows to look for you here . Brown . He said it reminded him of your eyes , but you don 't remember that , do you ? Don 't let him leave . He needs to take the key so he can lead us to Raven . God ! Mom , stop ! I 'll stop when you take this . Never . Get off him ! Are you ok ? She 's chipped . Octavia ! Don 't ! Mom ! What are you doing ? Please stop it ! Stop , Mom ! Don 't make me do this . [ Gunshot ] [ Octavia moaning ] Monty : Mom ! [ Gunshot ] Monty ! Hey . I just need to rewire the firing mechanism , and we 're good to go . Raven 'll be all right . You don 't know that . She 's all I have left , Clarke . What if this thing that I built destroys that brilliant mind of hers ? How do I live with that ? Jasper said that she was trying to disconnect herself from A.L.I.E. That 's not Raven anymore . You sure about that ? I 'm not sure about anything , but this is our only choice . That wasn 't really her . It was A.L.I.E. My mom was already gone . - Monty ... - It wasn 't her . [ Shifts gears ] It wasn 't her . They 've got the electromagnet . They 're on the way . You have to hurry . Look at your united front . Tell me , why do you give Bellamy a pass for murdering your girlfriend ? - What was her name ? - Don 't talk about Maya . You don 't have to listen to this . Raven : Let 's protect Jasper . Jasper 's so sensitive . Jasper 's lost someone . Everyone cater to his feelings . We 've all lost someone . You don 't see us falling apart . You don 't see us getting wasted , being useless ... Jasper : No . You took a pill to take your pain away . You gave up your memories . Raven : But then why should we expect anything more ? You used to get high off people 's medicine . Being a selfish loser was your only move . Please stop . That 's all we see when we look at you ... a coward , a waste of breath . Why do you even bother living ? You 're weak , pathetic . You can 't save me . You can 't even save yourself . You couldn 't save what 's her name . You know her name ! Jasper , think . It 's not Raven talking . You 're giving her what she wants . Go . Just you and me , huh ? Oh , come on , Bellamy . We 've had our fun together , haven 't we ? It 's ok . We don 't have to talk about it ... there 's really not much to talk about , anyway ... but I do have one question . Does it bother you that you don 't get any credit for the genocide at Mount Weather ? But you murdered all those people , too , and you 're just forgotten . Then again , you didn 't get any credit for the culling on the Ark , either . How many people suffocated when you threw away my radio ? You know , at least Clarke was saving her own people . You were just saving your own ass . Of course that 's nothing compared to killing your own mom . You just had to take little sister to her first dance . You might as well just shoved Aurora out of the airlock yourself . Do you think she 'd be proud of you now for the kind of leader you 've become , or would she see the truth like the rest of us do , that you 're a follower ? Clarke 's been back for one day , you 're already taking orders , the good , little knight by his queen 's side . Too bad you were never that devoted to Gina . You don 't know what you 're talking about . Don 't worry . Gina was already dead when Mount Weather blew up , and you avenged her , right ? I mean , you picked up a gun and slaughtered an army that was sent to protect us , that had nothing to do with blowing sweet Gina to bits , but , hey , a Grounder 's a Grounder , right ? My father , you ... - Niylah ... - You killed him . Clarke : Niylah , Niylah , you can 't be in here . Jasper : It 's too late . Raven 's already seen her . A.L.I.E. knows we 're here . Good work , Raven . Help is on the way . Niylah : Feel better ? All I wanted was to protect my people . By destroying mine . I 'm sorry . People like you always are . [ Rover approaching ] [ Rover doors open and close ] Bellamy : What happened ? Everyone , let 's go . We 're all set . Sinclair : All we have to do is connect her and activate the electromagnet . Their design is good . - Hold her arm still . - Raven ... They won 't be able to get here before they disconnect you . Hold it still . Raven ... You know too much . I can 't let them have you . - Raven , stop . - Raven , stop it . Stop it . - Stop it ! - Raven ! She 's trying to kill herself . Raven , stop . Raven ... Stop it ! Stop , and I 'll give you this . No . You lied ! You lied ! No . No . Please don 't . The EMP will give me brain damage . You know it will . Please don 't do this . - Don 't listen to her . - Please . You know it will . Sinclair , stop ! Sinclair , no . - We 've only got one shot at this . - No ! The EMP will fry the wristband , too . - Do it . Do it . - Ok . Got it . - Go . - No ! [ Zap ] What 's happening ? Nothing . There 's no more power . The battery 's not strong enough . Well , then get one that is . The rover . Bellamy : Sinclair , hold her ! Hold her ! Go , go , go . Go . Go . Bellamy : Go . [ Beeping ] Drone ! She 's here . [ Gunshot ] Not anymore . Get the damn battery . Go ! It 's ok . Here they come . This is our chance . Guys , we have to move ! Move ! - Come on . - Got it . [ Zapping ] [ Zapping stops ] She 's breathing . Raven ? Come on , Raven . Hey . - Come on , Raven . - Come on . Come on , Raven . Wake up . - Hey . - Wake up . Please . She warned us . Come on , Raven . Wake up . Please . - What are you doing ? - Don 't move . No . You can 't . No . Give it back . A.L.I.E. did that to Raven . She 's never gonna get this . Don 't ! Stop ! It 's Lexa . Part of her 's still in there . I saw them cut it out of her head . I 'm not ... What is it ? Both the A.I.s were made by the same person . Both tap into human consciousness . They must work similarly , right ? There 's probably only one pathway to consciousness , so it 's possible , yeah . What does this have to do with anything ? I 've seen an A.I. get removed before . Help me get her on her side . Ok . 1 , 2 , 3 . Get that med kit from my bag . Clarke : Yep . Ok . Sinclair : Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , what ... It 's ok . This has to work . What is that ? It must be whatever 's left of the chip . [ Coughing ] Hey , hey ... [ Panting ] Ow ... Get her up . Go . Never thought I 'd be so happy to see someone in pain . Ow ... Raven : Ow . Couldn 't do what you did . I could have saved my mom . Hey ... Get the hell away from me . A.L.I.E. knows we 're here . We got to move . _ I 'm sorry for not telling you about Bellamy , but you wouldn 't have helped if you knew the truth . You didn 't give either of us the chance to find out . Just go , Clarke . You can 't stay here . If you do , you 'll end up just like my friend . You need to run . It 's time for a supply run , anyway . You 'll recover . Will I ? What do you do when you realize you might not be the good guy ? Maybe there are no good guys . [ Rover approaching ] Back it up . Ok . Good . You 're really ok ? I 'm so sorry for all the crap I said . And for punching me in the face , right ? No . You definitely deserved that . Sinclair : Watch out . Ok . Step up . Hey , there 's something I don 't understand . Why did A.L.I.E. want you to kill yourself ? Because I know why she wants the second A.I. Why ? It 's the only thing that can stop her . Octavia : Then let 's stop her . We survive together . Come on . Ok . We 'll get Raven back . We 'll get them all . It 's bigger than that . With Raven 's abilities , she 'll be able to understand what she learned here . They 'll know the second A.I. can stop me . We 'll have to kill them all .

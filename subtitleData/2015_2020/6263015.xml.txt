 Big jim : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome Crashed down on chester 's mill , Cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , Forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons- - Rage ... Grief ... Fear . My god . ( people exclaiming ) Now , in order to survive , We must battle our most dangerous adversary ... The enemy within . Do you remember what we talked about ? What you need to do for barbie ? I 'll do whatever it takes . Christine and eva are using you . They want you to become like them . Barbie 's not the same . And aktaion 's all dead . We 're on our own . Abby ! ( sobbing ) ( stabbing ) i 'm sorry , But i 'll never be able to be who you want . Norrie : What happened ? I was supposed to meet sam . Why should you forgive him ? He killed angle ! You should 've told him to go screw himself . This is you . You 're back . Your fourth cervical vertebra Is fractured . You 'll never walk again . If it 's what 's best , Then i want to do it . No ! Let 's get him the hell out of here ! What happened ? Get me to the caves . Bring me sam . ( high-pitched pulsing ) Hey , what are you ... Hey ! Eva : Dale ! Dale , help ! Help ! Eva ! I 'm on my way ! Dale ! Audrey , no ! What the hell are you doing ? There 's no one to guide us . I need to jump . Stop ! You don 't want to do this . Stop ! ( panting ) ( pulsing continues ) It 's a shooting star . Those can 't all be shooting stars . Julia : Here , boy , indy . That all you got ? You got to put your gut into it . Indy ! He 's a dog ; he can hear us . I 'm trying not to scare him away . Indy 's not a liberal . He doesn 't get scared of everything . Indy ! Indy ! Indy ! ( gasps ) Pink stars ? Oh , don 't start with that crap again . Jim , look . What the hell ? Shooting stars burn out . Did that star just hit us ? Oh , my god . Looks like a meteor ! Barbie : I don 't get it , But at least the pink stars stopped them from jumping . Audrey said , " there 's no one to guide us . " She must have meant christine . Well , where is she ? I don 't know , but until she shows up , We have to make sure the town stays safe . ( distant rumbling ) Was that the dome ? Tell me it 'll protect us From the meteors . It held against the largest Non-nuclear ordnance the military has . A meteor impact is thousands of times stronger . Yes , it is . There must be something we can do . You 're not one to sit around and do nothing . The fire tower . I mean , that 's got a view of the whole town . So i can survey the damage , see if the dome held everywhere . When do we leave ? Whoa , we ? If it 's safe enough for you , it 's safe enough for me . Okay . So we go to the fire marshal 's office . We get the key . Key gets us access into the tower . " rusty loves linda . " Barbie : Yeah , linda was our sheriff . She died when the dome was magnetized . The dome held . What about everyone out there ? You saw how many meteors there were . Some will survive . Yes , some will survive the initial impact , But then the debris that was kicked up into orbit , That 'll rain down . And then the sun will disappear behind a dust cloud , And then comes the firestorm . How do you know all this ? I 'm an anthropologist . We study extinction level events . Yeah , well , you could be wrong . I could be , But i 'm not . The debris is falling now . I always thought the end would be caused by us . Nuclear war , global warming . The brick wall seen coming But slammed into anyway . All those people . Billions of them . You know , we spent so much time Trying to figure out how to get out of this thing , And now , If only we could figure out a way to get someone inside . The red door . What ? It 's a way in . We can get word out . We got to get to bird island . Why do you want to go to bird island ? Aktaion 's there . They have to be communicating with the outside world . There is a way in , okay ? I know . I 've been through it before . It 's a long shot that it 's still standing , But for anyone that 's alive out there , It 's the only shot that they have . That might not be a good idea . Eva , where 's the key ? What key ? The key for the hatch . I thought you had it . No , i stuck it right here . Did it fall ? Start looking . We got to find the key . Eva : Dale , it 's been hours . It 's no use . ( metal snapping ) Damn it ! Maybe it 's a good thing we 're stuck . How is that a good thing ? If you were able to get a message to the outside world , You and i both know what would happen . It 'd be chaos . People would do horrific things to one another To get through that door . And those are the people who would make it in . People like big jim or julia . People only interested in themselves . We-we can deal with those people . The real problem is : How do you feed them ? The thousand , 10,000 that would come through . Our-our resources are already stretched thin . You 're a good man , dale . You want to do what 's right , But look out there . This is no longer about right or wrong . This is about survival . The survival of this town . Yeah , but you can 't let everybody on the outside Just die without trying to do something . So many burdens . So much weight on your shoulders . It can all go away . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about ... No more worry . No more fear . No more doubt . You can be free , like me . In the process , join something greater . You can evolve . Do you feel it , dale ? The pull ? I know you can , just as i do . That 's the kinship . There 's harmony there . There 's peace . Freedom . You 'll still be you . With all your thoughts and desires . You still have desires , don 't you ? ( jingling ) Did you hide this ? I ... Dale , where are you going ? To bird island . Dale . Norrie : Was that ... ? A meteor impact . Yeah , like the one that killed all the dinosaurs . ( dome creaking ) Is the dome cracking ? Hunter : What the hell 's going on ? We don 't know . But it 's like an apocalypse out there . No . I meant , why did you bring me here ? Eva was gonna kill you . But i wanted her to . How can you even say that ? It 's best for the kinship . I 'm using up all the pain medication . What if others get sick ? The group 's survival comes first . Your medication must be wearing off . The pain 's making you say this . I 'm not in pain , and i know exactly what i 'm saying . If you weren 't so selfish , you 'd understand . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hunter , you can 't leave . Hey ! Help ! In the sweetbriar ! I need help ! Just shut up ! You want to die ? Yes ! Help ! Get off ... Help ! Help ! Stop . Let 's lock him in the freezer . ( muffled shouting ) Norrie : Shut up . I can 't believe he 's pissed About us trying to save his life . Julia said there 's something inside of us ... And it must be that that 's making him act like this . We 're infected . Terrific . More giant-ass meteors ? Secondary impacts . When debris from the first impact comes raining back down . It 's called " ejecta . " Or , you know , maybe it 's ... You know , not that . So you 're telling me That those seizures that we had When we said " the pink stars are falling ... " Meant that we were Prophesying the end of the world ? Look ... I probably have no idea what i 'm talking about . Even if we survive whatever 's infecting us , The whole world is gone . There 's no future for us . We have nothing to look forward to . Maybe we should just join them . The kinship ? No way . What 's the point , joe ? This entire town Was infected in those cocoons . The kinship has won . No , it hasn 't . We resisted . ( door opens , bell chimes ) Stay down . Be quiet . Just stay here . ( grunts ) joe , stop ! I 'm not gonna hurt you . What are you two doing here ? Hunter ( muffled ) : Help ! Help ! Is someone in there ? You 're not taking him . Taking who ? What 's going on ? Did junior and eva send you ? Are you a part of the kinship ? No . Not after what they did to abby . And i take it from the fact that you have someone in the freezer You 're not part of the kinship , either . Joe : After everything you 've done , Why should we listen to anything you say ? Because i killed christine . If christine 's dead , Does that mean the infection 's gone ? I don 't know . What infection ? No way , norrie . I still don 't trust him . He killed angle , And now he 's killed again . Joe . What sam did to angie is unforgivable . But we 're all fugitives from the kinship . And there 's not many of us . ( hunter moans ) Why is he gagged ? Joe : Because he wouldn 't stop yelling . Norrie : We took him from eva Because she was trying to kill him , Which he said he wanted . ( grunts , gasps ) I won 't yell . I don 't want them to find me . Thank you for saving my life . Looks like you broke a couple ribs During the fall , as well . You 'll heal , but it 's gonna take a while . We didn 't bring any pain medication . Here . This will get you through a few hours . Do you remember what happened ? Eva told me i was using up too many resources . That it would be best If i died . I said , " okay . " What made you change your mind ? I don 't know , it 's weird . I ... I remember thinking That all i cared about was the kinship . That it felt more important than my own life . But it doesn 't now ? I don 't want to die . It 's good to have you back , Hunter . Incoming . Sam : Get in the freezer . They won 't look for you if they find me . Go . Go , go , go , go . ( hunter groaning ) Why are you doing this ? I can never make up for what i did to you , But i can protect you . Give you a chance to fight back Against whatever 's happening to us . Whatever you hear , Don 't come out . ( bell on door chiming ) ( footsteps ) ( freezer door closes ) All clear . ( freezer door opens ) Told you they 'd be gone . I heard the door chime again . Who do you think was here ? I don 't know , But sam saved our asses . The sun rose . At least there 's that . ( groans ) Hey . How you feeling ? Any better ? What ? Hey . Drink this , it 'll help . ( norrie shrieks , joe grunts ) You 're keeping me from doing my duty for the kinship . Take me back to town hall or i 'll scream . Yeah , and we 'll put you back in the freezer And gag you . Why is he acting like this again ? Uh ... I don 't know . Hunter , no ! Hey ... Get back ! Stay back . Calm down , hunter . I swear , if you come any closer ... Hunter ... You want me to calm down ? ! Norrie : Stop ! You are keep me from doing my duty . ( gasps ) ( sniffs ) Where are they going ? I don 't know . But look at them . They look like ants marching in a line , Doing whatever queen christine ordered them to . Just a bunch of mindless drones , Only caring about her kinship . ( sighs ) Don 't let me get like that . We 're in this together . All the way to the bitter , Apocalyptic end . ( chuckles softly ) I was thinking about hunter . He got all freaky friday again Right after sam gave him another one of those pain pills . When he 's in pain , He 's as normal as hunter will ever be . When he 's on the meds , He 's like one of those drones outside . Hunter : Joe . Norrie . Oh , god . Should we take bets on which hunter we 're gonna get ? If it 's drone boy , we 're screwed . Joe . Norrie , please , help me . The pain is back . I 'm scared . What the hell is going on with you ? I think it 's fear . What do you mean ? When i was eight , i ... Was in a car accident with my mom . I was right there watching her die . ( shuddering breaths ) I had no idea . I 'm so sorry . Ever since , My greatest fear is dying young . But ... My point is , After my fall , i should have been scared out of my mind . But i didn 't feel anything because of the pain meds . And then ... When the pills wear off , I remember how afraid i am . ( sniffles ) ( shuddering breaths ) And i 'm me again . It 's not the pain . It 's the emotion . Wh-what do you mean ? Do you remember when sam stood you up And i lost it ? Yeah . That 's when you said the real me was back . I was angry . Christine is trying to keep us from having emotions . Because when our feelings surface , So does our humanity . For me , it 's anger . And for hunter , It 's fear . What about me ? Grief . Your sister . It was why Christine wanted you to forgive sam . So you could move on and join the kinship . Do you know what this means ? Do you ? We have a way to fight back . A way to fight the kinship . Pack your stuff . As soon as the coast is clear , we 're leaving . Where are we going ? To find julia . That meteor might have taken out half the damn country . ( dome creaks and rumbles ) We don 't know if what happened outside happened everywhere . We need to contact the outside world . Do we ? What 's knowing gonna do for you ? You know , jim , if you 're just gonna stand there being useless , Why don 't you do it outside where you don 't distract me ? You know , you 're always miss can do , huh ? Fine . I 'll go look for my dog . Indy ? Indy , where you at , boy ? Indy ? ( typing ) Change your mind ? You care to help ? ( computer beeps ) Forget it . It 's no use . There 's , um ... There 's nothing left out there . How do you know that ? Go see for yourself . ( gasps ) You need to be doing this now ? I knew the guy that owned this house . Ferguson faulkner . Don 't think ol ' ferg Would want his house turned into a torture chamber . He was a , you know , bleeding-heart type ... Rich as he was . And ... He was a lush , too . Which means ... We get to watch the world end While we drink the good stuff . Ah ! Obviously , he was a bird lover , too . Yeah , he loved them so much he had them killed and stuffed . Yeah . ( laughs ) Something funny ? I was just thinking how good I 'd look stuffed up there . They 'd have a hard time with your hair , though . And no trouble at all with yours . Uh-huh , it 's true . Remember that time everything froze ? Yeah , that was the night barbie ... Barbie what ? Nothing . Never mind . Go on ... With your fascinating story . Well , when i fished lyle chumley Out of the lake And , um ... Sidebar- - i should never do that again . ( laughs ) he started talking about the end of days . And how the world would be on fire In some , you know , wall of flame A thousand feet high . ( scoffs ) Like a lot of things , He got the apocalypse wrong , too . The sixth extinction . What ? Dinosaurs were the fifth extinction . Big old asteroid came . Bye-bye , triceratops ; bye-bye , brontosaurus . We ... Humans Will be the sixth . Well , we may be an endangered species , But we 're not going the way of the dodo anytime soon . No ? Say this fishbowl doesn 't crack . How long you think it 's gonna be Before christine comes looking to wipe us out ? She said , you know , we stay out of her way , She 'll stay out of ours . Was that before or after you sold her out And i tried to kill her ? I say ... ( grunts ) Instead of getting wiped out That we should do the wiping . There 's no point . What , are you afraid of getting your hands dirty ? ( chuckles ) It 's not about that . There 's too many of them ! Look , you and i ... Are not much of a resistance ; Not without a way to turn people back . Listen , i say we take these . We take out as many of those , uh , Those body snatchers as we can . Just , you know , we make a last stand Like , uh , butch and sundance . Including the part where they die ? See , that 's what you never understood . Since the dome came down , That was the only outcome there was ever gonna be . You 're right . ( laughs ) : I can 't believe i 'm gonna say it , But ... You 're right . ( smacks lips ) Well ... It finally happened , huh ? You finally , uh , giving up on all that ... Sunny-side-up , Pollyanna routine , huh ? Talking all that crap about how the dome 's here to save us . Oh , no . I wasn 't wrong . ( laughs ) oh , the dome 's here to protect . It 's just not here to protect us . Guess this means i 'll never get to go to paris . Paris ? ( sniffs ) Plenty of stuff to regret more than ... Not getting to that dirty ciudad . That 's spanish . You know , i 'm surprised that , uh , you never made it there , Being , uh ... All cosmopolitan like you are . Surprised someone like you ended up here In chester 's mill , to be honest . How 'd that happen ? Peter shumway . ( chuckles ) : Right . You know , i got to tell you , Never made sense to me , the two of you . Now you tell me . ( sighs ) : I don 't know . He was a doctor- - maybe i was looking for security . You find it ? ( laughs softly ) You know he was a mess . Couldn 't even take care of himself . I never knew what it felt like to be safe or in love Until i met barbie . And look how that worked out . ( laughs softly , sniffles ) Such a cliché , right ? Falling for the dark , mysterious guy and ... ( clears throat ) then get all bent out of shape When he turns out to be dark and mysterious . Look at us- - two former enemies Drinking at the end of the world . ( laughs ) " former " ? Oh , come on , jim . ( sighs ) You must have regrets . Yeah , course i do . With junior . Pushed him too hard , i suppose . Talk about a cliché . Treat your son like a second chance To overcome your own shortcomings Instead of treating him like his own person . You named him after yourself , for god 's sake . You 're wrong . Nice try . You know , you and me , we might have some stuff in common , Julia , but do not try to dissect me With your cheapjack psychobabble . There 's only one thing in this life That i regret , and that 's letting everything That i earned , everything i ever cared about ... Get taken away from me . And i 'll be damned If i let anything get taken away again . ¶ ¶ ( dog barking in distance ) Indy ! ( barking continues ) There you are , boy ! There you are , boy ! Oh , good boy ! There you are ! Good boy ! Good boy . ( kisses ) Where were you , huh ? Oh , yeah . Where were you ? Where were you ? Is that the sun ? No , it 's coming from the wrong direction . It 's getting closer . What is it ? ( whispers ) : It 's a wall of flame . ( high-pitched pulsing ) I 'm gonna bring back sam . Just like you asked . ( deep whirring ) ( indistinct chatter ) ( bell chimes ) No , no ! Stop ! Joe , i 'm not gonna hurt you . What are you two doing here ? ( low , indistinct chatter ) Audrey . Have you seen sam ? We have . Where ? The sweetbriar . Whatever you hear , don 't come out . ( bell chimes ) Sam ? You in here ? Junior . Hey . It 's good to see you . What are you doing in here ? When those pink stars hit , i took cover . ( clink ) Have they stopped ? For now . Junior , why is there blood on your hands ? It 's christine . She 's been stabbed . She 's alive , but ... You 're the only one i can trust . Do you know who did this ? No . But i took her body to the caves . The caves ? I stopped the bleeding the best that i could . But you have to help her . Christine needs you , sam . Lead the way . Sam : Oh , my god , the dust is so thick . You can 't even see the sun . It 's like it was before . You don 't remember ? Remember ... Remember what ? Great destruction . It 's happening all over again . Like it did on our home world . It was so long ago , So many lives lost . Which is why we traveled so far . For safety . Is it coming back to you now ? Of course . All these people- - Aren 't you worried anyone out here Could be the one who stabbed christine ? They won 't follow us in the caves- - They aren 't special like you and i And eva . Barbie . Each of us has a unique purpose . That 's what separates us from the drones . And right now our purpose is to save our queen . Watch your step . Thanks . You 're no good to us if you fall and break your neck . You never said why you brought christine down here . It 's what she asked me to do . You spoke to christine ? She 's conscious ? You 'll see . We 're almost there . Come on . Keep up . Junior , slow down . We can 't keep christine waiting . Junior . Junior ? ( grunts ) What are you doing ? I 'm hurting you , like you hurt christine . I had no choice . She 's evil . You 're still not one of us . Not part of the group . You know what happens to those that aren 't part of the group ? You don 't understand- - she put something in us . I know . We have to stop her . The only one who needs to be stopped Is you . ( both grunting ) Oh , my god . No . ¶ ¶ No . No . No ! Hey , stop ! ¶ ¶ I can help you . There 's a way in ! There 's a way in here ! Dale , you can 't help them . The world outside- - it 's the past . Humanity , with all its terrible flaws , With all the mistakes it 's made- - it 's gone . If we 're gonna survive , You have to let it go . I don 't think i can . Dale . When are you gonna admit to what you already know ? You 're one of us . You and i- - We 're part of something greater . Julia gave this back to me . They 're part of a world That you used to be a part of . But you can 't save that world . You can save the one you 're part of now . The one right here . Please , dale . Join us . Save us . ¶ ¶ Christine 's in there . 'cause of you . When she comes out , you 're gonna answer for what you did . Safe to say your eiffel tower 's a ... Puddle of molten iron . We 're all that 's left . You and me , jim . We 're the last living humans on earth . We 're the last living humans On earth . ( barking ) Oh ! Norrie , joe ! They 're okay . What are you doing here ? We came to find you . Hunter ? But he 's ... He 's one of us . Just recently converted . There 's a way to save the town . How ? Emotion . No , no , no , no , no , you 're not going anywhere . Are you ready to face judgment ? You 're all sure you want to do this ? Like you even need to ask , red . Hell yeah , i do . Okay . Then the resistance starts here . ( beeping ) Man : Is anyone there ? Please confirm . I repeat : Is anyone there ? Please confirm .

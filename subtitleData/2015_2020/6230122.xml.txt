 BIG JIM : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons ... rage ... grief ... fear . My God . ( people exclaiming ) Now , in order to survive , we must battle our most dangerous adversary ... the enemy within . I 'm Christine Price . This is my friend , Eva . JULIA : You were together for what felt like a year . So I understand if you still have feelings . You can 't possibly understand any of this . - You never went anywhere . - I did . I moved on . I got rid of you . You should be thanking me . Yesterday we were together . But in the Matrix , you moved on without me . CHRISTINE : According to the dark flight calculations of the meteoroid ... ( quietly ) : Therapist , my ass . - _ - ( indistinct radio chatter ) You got that , Malick ? I 'm getting out of here . You 're leaving town ? Those people , they 're not the same . They 've changed . I 'm right about them . Just like I was right about everything else . â™ª ( quietly ) : What the hell is that ? What is she ? ( bird chirping ) What a surprise to see you here . Is this your campsite ? Took your advice ... dropped the match . No more house , no more Big Jim . ( panting ) Oh . I just get so sweaty when I run . Do you have a clean shirt I could borrow ? Yeah . ( whispers ) : What ? How does that make you feel ? I feel like my dad 's gonna come after me . Ah . Well , letting go of the past and moving on ... is a process . You 've taken an important first step . Hey , what are you doing today ? I was gonna head into town . Perfect . I could use your help with a project . Well ... I 'll see you soon . BIG JIM : Well , normally , I 'd applaud you , kid , but ... that woman ... that thing . Wait ! ( grunting ) ( grunts ) ( door opens ) ( relieved sigh ) Are you okay ? You said you 'd be back in an hour . I didn 't sleep all night , worrying . Yeah . I , uh ... was just out wandering . After I buried Melanie and Dad , I needed some more time . Sorry . I understand . What 's this ? JULIA : Oh , it 's an I.D. badge . I found it in the biggest cocoon , where Melanie put the egg . I 'm guessing whoever was inside must be important . Yeah . Makes sense . I think we should talk to Christine . I think she knows more than she 's telling us . Well , Christine saved your life . She killed Melanie to do it . And I 'm grateful . But how did she show up at the perfect time ? She said she was out hunting . Where are you going ? Into town . Why ? Because I think we should . Barbie ... wait . What the hell ? Where 's the camera ? Where 's the camera ? CHRISTINE : It 's amazing how quickly they 've begun to gather . Last night they heard my call ; today ... more have set up camp . One by one , they 're completing their journeys . James is farthest along . He 's let go of the fear that held him back . Today I 'll assess his progress and see if he 's ready to take the next step . Sam is also doing very well , putting his shame behind him . And Norrie has let go of most of her anger . But I 'm concerned about Joe ... he didn 't show up last night . Perhaps his grief has resurfaced . His resistance could be contagious if it 's not snuffed out . I 'll pay him a visit . Well , I 'm surprised to see Barbie with Julia . He and Eva seemed so bonded last night . The moment he 's ready to move on ... there won 't be any reason for her to exist . ( birds chirping ) Come on . Your turn . There 's no way I 'm stripping down and getting in there . ( laughs ) : You said if I did , you would . Yeah , and you fell for it . ( squeals ) ( both laugh ) I can 't believe we stayed up all night . I 'm not even tired . Yeah , staring up at the moon must be the cure for exhaustion , 'cause I don 't feel like I 'll ever need sleep again . Yeah , but what were we doing ? All of just standing there ? Who cares ? It felt good . I used to hate that " all join hands " kind of crap . But now ... Introducing Norrie 2.0 . - The mellower ... - ( laughs ) sweeter Norrie . Seriously ? I was looking for you all night . I was stupid enough to even be worried about you . - Joe ... - I knew something was up . Why couldn 't you just tell me ? You obviously want your Matrix life back ... sororities , Hunter . Not me . Let 's just end this . CHRISTINE : The living situation outside worries me . There 's too many people and not enough tents . Well , the houses were destroyed when the dome contracted , so there 's nowhere else for them to go . I 'd like to change all that . I 'd like to blow out the walls and fashion one large communal area . How would you do that ? ( sighs ) Remove the trim , cut through the drywall , take out the studs with a reciprocating saw . See ? You retained the knowledge you gained in the other world . James ... ( long sigh ) Chester 's Mill needs to heal from the wounds that your father inflicted . Tearing down his office shows everyone that Big Jim no longer has a hold on this place . If this is too hard for you , I understand . Someone else can handle it . ( sighs ) : But ... it might be good for you . Cathartic . Who are you ? Where are we ? Hey , what are you doing here ? Hey , slow down ! Wait ... Get the hell away from me ! Get away from me ! Get away ! No ! ( screams ) - Please tell me you have the camera . - What 's wrong ? Is it missing ? I had it last night ; this morning it was gone . Did someone see you with it yesterday ? Why are you assuming it was my fault ? - Oh , my God . - Maybe someone 's suspicious of you . I don 't understand why you 're still pretending to be a therapist . I am following the path set out for me in the alternate reality . Do you hear yourself ? You sound crazy . Oh , any crazier than thinking you 're pregnant ? Or holding hands with Dale Barbara in front of the whole town ? What happened in those cocoons clearly affected us . Yeah . The man I was with for what felt like a year will barely look at me , and I 'm lying to him about who I am . Maybe the footage being stolen is a sign . Oh , no , it 's not a sign , it 's a screw-up ... we have to get it back . I 'm guessing that it was either Jim Rennie or Julia Shumway who took it . Jim seems to have taken off , but Julia , she ... well , she 's two doors down at the motel . She is ? With Dale ? - ( knocking , door opens ) - SAM : Hey . Am I interrupting ? Not at all . Eva was just leaving . Thank you for letting me know . Rest assured I 'll ... handle the situation . How 's the support group going ? Good . We had more people today . Coming together as a community is really helping . And how 's Abby Dewitt ? - Is she coping any better ? - She didn 't show this morning . I 'll track her down , make sure she 's okay . Thank you . How are you doing ? I still need to ask Joe for forgiveness . Would you like me to talk to him ? That 'd be great . Be at the Sweetbriar at 7 : 00 p.m. tonight . I 'll make sure that Joe 's there . You 're doing the right thing , Sam . JULIA : There 's barely one can per family . Well , when people get hungry , things get bad real fast . I saw it happen last year . You mean when you were in the cocoon ? Yeah . Hi . How are you ? I 'm good . Get me a blanket . Here , take ... My son , my son ! My son is in there ! I got him . He 's okay . Get something under his head . Okay . Somebody have any water ? - Okay . - Sweetheart , here you go . These tents are too close together ... - it 's dangerous . - Yes , you 're right . Look , I know that many of you are without homes and others just want to be close to fellow Millers so we can lean on each other , which is why we 're building dorms inside the town hall . Pete , right ? You worked construction before the dome came down ? We could just really use your help . James Rennie is organizing a crew inside . Yeah , I 'll do whatever I can . Thank you . Using town hall for housing is smart , but ... food 's still our real issue . Have you considered alternate sources ? Seeds , wild plants ? We 've pretty much combed through this whole town . I 've worked in famine-stricken countries , learned a few tricks . Can 't hurt to look again , right ? You could show me around town . Yeah , I guess I could . Wonderful . Maybe we can discuss the dorm plans . I 'd really love your input . His tests are negative . Contact with the egg hasn 't altered him . No need for that mask . 15 panels , all consistent . Malick ? Aktaion 's inside the dome . JULIA : I wanted to thank you for yesterday . If you hadn 't shown up , Melanie would 've killed me . Thank God that you were looking for food in exactly the right spot . Yeah , it was a lucky coincidence . Hunter , Norrie . Where 's Joe ? I thought that he was with you . He 's had kind of a rough time since we got out of the cocoons and he ran off somewhere . Well , I 'll find him . What can we do to help ? More hunting ? You were hunting ? I killed a pig . CHRISTINE : Well , Barbie and Eva are out looking for food , but Junior could use you on his dorm-building team . I 'll show you . Do you mind waiting here for me ? Of course not . Thanks . Come on . What are you doing with that ? It ... looks like my voice recorder . I was a reporter . Carried it everywhere . After the dome came down I lost it in the chaos , so when I saw this ... - In my drawer ? - Well , you 've only been here a day . I didn 't think you had time to furnish an office . You were snooping . I don 't blame you . I would 've done the same thing . I 'm happy to answer any questions you have . What 's on the recorder ? Notes about my clients . What happened in those cocoons left people reeling . I 'm just trying to help . So you keep saying . It 's the truth . Could I have that ? I don 't want to betray their confidences . I found something in the caves . Maybe you can help me figure out who it belongs to , since you seem to know everybody so well . Better than me , even . What did you want to show me ? Found it at the tunnel 's exit . ( chuckles ) Finally , a question I can answer . It 's my I.D. badge from the University of Zenith . Oh , you teach ? Jack-of-all-trades , huh ? - Yeah , I like to keep busy . - Hmm . What happened between Barbie and Eva must be very difficult for you . Well , that wasn 't real . This is . I 'm still impressed that you 're okay with them going off together after what happened last night . Oh , he didn 't tell you ? You know , I 'm available if ... you need to talk . It was really great talking to you , Christine . BIG JIM : Well , well , well . If it isn 't my old buddy Malick . From outside the dome . Tell me about the egg . Egg ? Oh , you , oh , you mean the egg that I gave you after you promised my family would get out ? Somehow it got back in here , along with your company . How 'd you get in ? Where 's the egg ? Oh , I bet you 'd like to know . You 're scared . All these tests , the isolation . There 's something inside that egg , isn 't there ? And you think it infected me . Well , you 've got it wrong . I 'm not the one you should be worried about . We made a deal once , Malick , but you never followed through . Now here 's your chance . I can tell you all kinds of things . And you better act quick , because you 're right ... what 's inside that egg is scary as hell and it 's already been unleashed . BARBIE : We lost most of these crops to an infestation . The rest of ' em to a freeze . Was that before or after the frogs fell from the sky ? The frogs are still on our bucket list . I thought Morocco was tough . - Do you remember that hailstorm ? - Yeah . You mean the hailstorm that started in the middle of a sandstorm , right ? Pellets the size of a softball . We had that crappy little tent and one sleeping bag . Yeah . Didn 't think there was any way we were gonna make it till the morning . We did . We made the most of the night . Now all I can think about is how you 're sleeping in the same motel as me , two doors down , but with her . Seeds . They 're viable . We could harvest them , start planting . Yeah , corn 's gonna take months to grow . We 're gonna be out of food in days . Well , it 's a good long-term plan . We just need to figure out the short term . Who 's this optimist ? 'Cause you 're a realist . That 's true . But I know you . You 're not gonna let this town starve . What 's that ? BARBIE : What ... the silos ? Yeah , we already thought about those . They 're filled with cattle feed . - Cattle feed ? - Yeah . Hmm . - ( whistling ) - Do you think Joe 's all right ? Yeah . Christine will talk to him . Yeah , I guess . ( stops whistling ) Keep moving . We 're waiting on you . So , Nor , I was thinking since Joe 's not here , there 's no reason we can 't pick up where we left off . We 're supposed to be working . I didn 't mean right now . But I bet we could find an empty closet around here . You 're such a romantic . I just keep thinking of how crappy it was to let Joe see us like that . He had a right to be pissed . I would 've been . So ... next time you see him , apologize . - What else can you do ? - I don 't know . It 's just ... it feels like a year has passed to me , but for Joe it seems like it was just the one day . That makes no sense . He was in the alternate reality , too . He 's a big boy . He 'll figure it out . What are you doing here ? Looking for you . Got a nice tour of Chester 's Mill in the process . This place blows . Under the dome , not under the dome ... ( scoffs ) doesn 't matter . Is this about Norrie and Hunter ? Norrie 's changed . Hunter , too . And part of me wants to be like them , but ... Something 's holding you back . Your grief . I saw a dead body yesterday . Andrea Grinnell . Yeah , made you think of your sister . Of course it did . But it 's more than that . I want to feel better , but I don 't want to be like Norrie or Hunter . Something about them is just off . Yeah , I hear you , Joe . But ... I want you to just consider that frustration might be clouding your view . You see that Norrie 's happy and you 're not and it upsets you . Maybe . In the alternate reality we spoke about how grief was weighing you down . But remember how good you felt when you finished your college portfolio ? Having a ... a sense of purpose helped you let go of the past . You need something to make you feel like a part of our group . Part of our kinship . Like what ? Well , this town 's got all kinds of needs . Your choice . Can I ask you to do one thing for me , though ? Sam came to me today . He wants to meet with you . Finish the conversation that you started before in the other world . Yeah ... He 'll be at the Sweetbriar tonight at 7 : 00 . Just consider it . But for what it 's worth , I think you 're ready to forgive him ... and to finally move on . Abby ? Abby , you here ? ( gasps ) - Uh , uh ... - ( choking ) Abby . Abby ! Abby ! Come on ! ( coughing , gasping ) Slow breaths . In and out . ( coughing , gasping ) You 're drunk . I figured if it ... was my last day on Earth , I might as well enjoy it . What happened ? I just couldn 't bear it . Not for another hour or another minute . I was up on that chair half the day . When I heard the door open , I just went for it . ( groans ) At least I 'm not alone anymore . You don 't want to do this . The dome 's gonna come down for real one day . - You 'll be reunited with your baby . - Even if that happens , I am never getting her back , okay ? Surprise . I know you think I lost my daughter 'cause of the dome , but she was long gone before that . Social Services took her right out of my arms . I can help , Abby . You messed up once , but you can change . Who are you trying to save , me or you ? 'Cause I thought the same thing when I got pregnant . I thought I was gonna clean up and be the best mom . But then it was 2 : 00 a.m. and the baby was screaming and the bottle was right there . There 's no fixing me . ( sniffles ) ( crying ) Trust me . Took a crew out to one of the houses that was crushed . That 's great . Thank you . Hey , if it buys me a place to live , it 's all good . I 've been freezing my ass off at night . We 'll move people in when construction 's complete . Why wait ? Eh , we want to do this fairly . Everyone at the same time . Oh , man . Don 't feed me that bullcrap . I know how your daddy runs things . - Like father , like son . - I 'm nothing like Big Jim . I don 't hand out favors . Ah . It 's because of her , isn 't it ? Who ? Christine Price . I saw how she worked in the alternate reality , always giving orders , never taking ' em . She told you what to do , didn 't she ? At least I respected Big Jim . Only thing I like about Christine is watching her walk away . ( grunts ) We don 't make deals . ( grunts ) It 's simple . Tell us about the egg , or we torture you . And this ... this is a preview . Wait , wait . Stop . I know where the egg is . I stole it . It 's here on Bird Island . Take me to it . Me and my boss . Right now . Let 's go . ( grunting ) ( grunting ) : Come on . Get up . Not a sound . ( panting ) Don 't move . You 're gonna take me to the comm station outside . We 're gonna talk to whoever 's in charge , and we 're gonna make a little trade , your life for my ticket out of this godforsaken dome . Any questions ? Which way ? Drop the weapon . I 'm walking out of here . You try to stop me , he dies . Mm-hmm . ( gunshot ) You killed your own man . Yes . For the egg . Where is it ? You need me . If I die , you got no one to tell you where the egg is . Let him go . He can 't get far . BARBIE : People eating cattle feed ? I didn 't think that was possible . EVA : The feed had to be pulverized and fermented and it tastes disgusting , but it 's digestible . ( grunts ) ( muffled thumping ) That 's a good sign . All right , there 's a window up top here . Anything ? There 's feed ! How much ? Well , it looks like enough to hold us over till the crops start producing . ( shouting ) Dale ! Hang on ! Okay . - ( shouts ) - ( grunting ) ( grunts ) One , two , three . ( panting ) - What are those ? - ( Joe grunting ) Solar panels . A bunch of ' em got pulled off of people 's homes when the dome was magnetized . Might be able to use ' em to get the power running again . I 'm impressed . And you 're out here getting creative , while everyone else is at Town Hall doing ... Christine Price 's bidding . Actually , it was a conversation with her that made me think of it . Guess she found you before I did . It was a good talk . She thinks my issues with Sam are holding me back . Your issues with Sam ? That man murdered your sister two weeks ago . Why does she care ? Why do you listen to her ? What she says just makes sense . We all have to work together now and get along , help the kinship . ( chuckles ) " The kinship . " I 've never heard you talk like that . Yeah . That 's what Christine calls it . Oh , my God . Christine works for Aktaion . No . No way . Christine 's a therapist . That 's what she said , but I found her badge . She said it was her university I.D. That looks exactly like the Aktaion logo to me . JOE : You 're right . So ... Christine 's been lying to us ? About that and who knows what else . EVA : It 'll have to be ground down , boiled , and we have to find a fermenting agent , but it 's doable . Great work . You two make a good team . Yeah . Well , I should , uh ... I should get home . JUNIOR : We need to take it out to open up the room . - PETE : You can 't . It 's safe . - I checked - the plans . - Well , you better read ' em again , because , I 'm telling you , that column is load-bearing . - Look , I know how to read blueprints . - Oh , in la-la land , maybe . Here in the real world , I spent five years working construction . You take that out , the whole place is gonna come crashing down . Christine ? ( chuckles ) Come on , man . Really ? She is probably the only person here who knows less about this than you do . Hey , let the big boys handle this , sweetheart , all right ? - Hey . Hey ! - Move . My team , my call . Get out now . You are gonna regret this . All of you . Good job . ( chuckles ) Oh , my God . Where did you find chocolate ? Andrea had some . I figured keeping one bar wasn 't gonna hurt anybody . Thank you . Today has not been my favorite day ever . Well , it 's not all bad . ( chuckles ) We 're together . Um , I thought this was what you wanted . It is . I ... Just not right now . Right . I guess you 're used to Joe . What 's that mean ? He 's a kid . You 're not . We 're a better fit . Yeah , we might be , but I can 't tell because all - you care about is screwing me . - I thought we were just having fun . If you want to talk or whatever , I can do that , too . No . You know what ? This just isn 't me . ABBY : You 're wasting your time , Sam . I am done pretending that I can move on , all right ? I hurt my kid and there is not enough absolution in the world ... In the alternate reality , you got her back . It was a fantasy , Sam ! A lie , all right ? It never existed and it never will . You killed a girl . You stole her from her family . You think saying sorry changes that ? It 's all I can do . It 's not enough . No one will ever forgive you . You 're just like me , beyond salvation , beyond anything other than another drink . ( door opens ) How 'd it go ? We found food . Cattle feed , but it 'll work . That 's great . Christine 's got some ideas to make it more palatable . We need to talk about her . She 's not who she says she is . - She works for Aktaion . - What ? The badge I found in the caves belongs to Christine . She admitted it . She said that she works for Aktaion ? No , she said it was her university I.D ... but the logo is Aktaion 's . I mean , maybe . Or maybe the university logo just looks similar . It fits perfectly . Barbie , this is Aktaion . You father 's company . You know better than anyone how shady they are . They always wanted the egg , and now Christine appears out of nowhere trying to take over the town ? I don 't know how it all fits together , but Christine is lying . - Eva , too . - You see ? Don 't bring Eva into this . Eva is lying ! And so are you . You were with her last night , weren 't you ? Nothing happened . All right , well , then what did you do all night ? Look , this is complicated , okay ? You keep telling me you understand , but you don 't ! I 'm trying ! But you need to be honest with me ! I saw your face this morning ! You wanted to go with her ! We needed to find food ! - Someone else could 've done that ! - Come on . Yesterday you promised we were gonna get through this . I waited up all night to talk to you while you were with her ! Same thing today ! What am I supposed to do ? ! I 'm supposed to just-just sit here while you go off and screw her ? ! ( gasps ) I don 't know what 's going on but you need to leave . ( door opens ) ( door closes ) ( gasps ) I 've just been walking in circles trying to ... figure this whole thing out . Did you ? Ever since we woke up , I haven 't been able to shake the feeling I 'm pregnant . I know how weird that sounds . What we had ... that felt just as real to me as it did to you . I mean , the baby , us . Did you take the test ? I haven 't looked at it yet . Where is it ? Right there . What 's it say ? It 's negative . Well , I guess it wasn 't meant to be after all . You should go . ( clears her throat ) I 'll be all right . ( sniffles ) ( crying ) ( quietly ) : Hey . ( insects chirring ) ( bell jingles ) Isn 't this better than whatever you were gonna do ? Yeah ? I like you this way . â™ª ( running footsteps , panting ) â™ª ( panting ) ( panting ) ( hammer cocks ) You don 't want to shoot me , Red . I promise I 'm not the bad guy here . They kidnapped me . They ran tests on me . ( panting ) They work for Aktaion . ( gunshot ) What are you doing here ? Shouldn 't you be off with your new boyfriend , singing " Kum-Bah-Ya " " with the town ? Wasn 't feeling it . What about Hunter ? Listen , Joe , I 'm sorry . What we did was crappy . Really crappy . Whatever . I 've had a lousy day . Can I just go to sleep ? What happened ? Tell me . I was supposed to meet Sam . He was supposed to ask for my forgiveness , like in the Matrix world . But ... he didn 't show . I was ready to do this huge thing ... which I wasn 't even sure I wanted to do . I feel like an idiot for letting Christine talk me into it . Why should you forgive him ? ! He killed Angie ! And for him to not even show up after you agreed to meet him ? He should have groveled , and you should 've told him to go screw himself . I hate him ! I hate everyone ! Why are you smiling ? Because ... this is you . You 're back . What the hell was wrong with me ? I don 't know but I missed you . â™ª Does this mean I ... I should get a condom ? Do you have one ? Yeah . I have ... like , a lot . Well , that 's overkill . But yeah . Definitely yes . Okay . JUNIOR : What are we doing here ? I 'm taking my star pupil on a field trip . Back to where it all began . You did well today . Perfectly , in fact . But not everyone is falling into line . The longer they 're outside the cocoons , the more their humanity takes hold . But not to fear . There 's a solution . How can I help ? I have something special planned for you . In time , it 'll become clear . But for now you 're exactly what I need . â™ª

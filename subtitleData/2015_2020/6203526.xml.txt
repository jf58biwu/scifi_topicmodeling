 Why doesn 't the psycho go live with one of her other sisters ? Because it 's your turn . What 's that thing ? These are my babies . - Then who are you ? - A messenger . Pretty sure you 've got some merchandise that belongs to my boss . If I want your wife , I 'll just take her . I was sanctioned by Topside . To conduct a security review of self-aware clones , not screw our product ! Because they will kill you . What do you want ? Wow , " Dr. Moreau . " I love this book . Sorry , um ... Who else knew about the book ? Because Castor knew exactly what they were looking for . Your resignation is accepted . You might need this while you 're out in the cold . Sarah : You 're gonna translate that , or else we send you back to Delphine . Felix : In London town we all fell down . Nealon : Thank you , Rachel . Sorry to raise any false hopes . - London . - What do you mean ? Well , the bit Rachel translated points to London . To the Castor original . We need to get to him first . Are we going home ? Not exactly Knightsbridge , is it ? I thought we were meant to be in the old neighborhood . Siobhan : My old neighborhood , chicken , before I took you lot in . Get walking . Left foot , right foot . Works the same this side of the pond . - Terry ? - Bartender : At the back , love . Are we meeting someone already ? No time to waste . We have to track down Castor , so ... I called an old friend . 20 years ago , he helped to find you . Siobhan the bomb . You ain 't changed a day . Sarah , Felix , Terry . All right ? Got my message ? Yeah , course I did . Exact make and model requested . Consider it my welcome home . Better get some pints and get into it then . Now you 're talking . You three sit tight . I 'll be back in a jiff . You get right down to business , don 'tcha ? When we find the Castor original , there 's only one way this can go . I 'm gonna kill him . Coady : All fowl have feathers . Some feathers are brown . Conclusion , all fowl is brown . False . Some poisons are pills . All pills are purple . Conclusion , all poisons are purple . [ Distantly ] All poisons are purple . True or false . How long do I have ? Our best cryptographers are working to crack the Duncan code . We 'll find the original Castor . Ha ! Very good . You are fierce warrior . You will win this competition . Oscar says I 'm too small . No , small is good . Small is a weapon . You stand this close . When I hit , you block . Then you look me in the eyes ... And you punch . Ack ! I am choking , so you come where I am vulnerable . Like this . Aah ! Ack ! Gracie : Helena ! We don 't do things like that anymore , remember ? I don 't think I 'm allowed . No , of course not . I am a mother now , I walk a different path . Terrance : So we slipped you out of the orphanage . Do you remember that ? Sarah : Mmm , sort of . I remember being at your house in the country , and ... Nah , wasn 't mine . Just one of a few places we had back then . What do you mean , like safehouses ? Where you were , like , hiding fugitives ? Yeah , and a place for Carlton to shag your mother . Oh ... - What ! - No ! - Enough of that . - What was that ? Yeah . Look , the reason we 're here goes back to those days . I want you to just have a look at this and see what you make of it . Terrance : " In London town we all fell down . " Who you after , bleeding ' mother goose ? Could be . I don 't know what this other shite is , but I 'll tell you this , this here number says that this Castor fellow was a guest of her majesty 's . Sarah : What do you mean ? That 's a prisoner 's number ? Yeah , a lifer . Long stretch . See , only the old geezers have this kind of tag . They changed the numbering system in the ' 80s . Reckon you want a name for this bloke , yeah ? We want a name , and as soon as you can get it . I 'll talk to a mate , see what I can find out . Yeah ? Shouldn 't take long . Cheers . Alison : Oh , hi ! Could you just put that on the table there with all the other stuff ? Goodness , I think I will need a few more of these . Oh , Gracie ! Before you go . The body butter recipe is on ... Is on the bulletin board over there , and please , please , could you go in today and make sure ... Actually , Mrs. Hendrix , I have a doctor 's appointment this afternoon . Oh , of course . Yes , take the day off . - Thank you . - Good . Okay , that 's ... good , so where is my husband ? Where is Donnie ? Ah ... ah ... [ Cellphone ringing ] Hi , honey . Sorry , I got up early to go for a run . Alison : Oh ! You didn 't come to bed last night . You know what , my ... My stupid sinus was whistling again , so I decided to just sleep on the couch . Ow ! Are you all right ? Yeah , no , I 'm fine . I think I just , um , pulled a hammy . Okay , but please , please , go by the store today . I am on the trail all day and we 're shorthanded , okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm on it . Thank you ! Love you . Hello ? Oh , God . Shay : So I 'm thinking huevos rancheros at the counter . Mmm . Uh ... What ? What was that ? Huevos ? You just quit your job , so I 'm buying extra salsa for you . I can 't , actually , today . I 've got all this , um ... Paperwork , exiting clause bullshit . - Is everything okay ? - Mm-hmm . You feeling okay ? Give me your forehead . Yeah , no , I 'm fine , I 'm fine . I just gotta go . I 'll call you later , okay ? Okay . [ Loud knocking ] Shit ! We 're closed . [ Knocking ] Okay , yeah , all right , okay , I hear you . Come in . That looks like it hurts . [ Groan ] You should see the other guy . I did . He said you jumped him . Jason Kellerman ? No ! I may have pushed him a little , provoked him . We ... we ... We had words . Come on ! What are you doing ? Please , I-I just ... I just put that back . Where 're the pills ? What ? Why ? Pouchy wants them back . Pouchy ? This is between me and Kellerman . It 's got nothing to do with ... Oh , come on ! Kellerman vouched for you to Pouchy . He doesn 't anymore . You 're out . Look , the pills aren 't here , I swear . Stop ! What ? Nitrogen , frozen . What 's this ? I don 't know , I 've never seen it before . Looks important . I 'll keep it . Until you return the entire supply to Pouchy . Mmm , minty gleam . I suggest you do it soon . Cosima : Dude , this sucks . Is this all you have ? Schnapps ? I don 't really entertain much . Cosima , nothing in here says Shay is a spy . Except that she saw the book . You remember that . Right before Rudy showed up . And once she asked about Sarah . Apparently I said her name in my sleep , but I don 't sleep-talk . Sleep-talking is creepy as shit . One thing ? When Rudy showed up , he knew you were sick again . Does Shay know that ? Does she know I 'm morbidly ill ? Yes . Yep , it came up . Yep . I 'm such an idiot . You couldn 't have known . Yeah , well , I should have . I put everyone in danger . You , Sarah , everybody . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to eat shit . Siobhan : What 's the matter , Felix ? Lost your taste for egg and chips ? No , I 'm just gonna wait for them to bring me my jellied eel . [ Chuckle ] I just can 't get the image of you and Carlton shagging out of my head . So that was after the late John Sadler , I presume . These boys were all John 's friends . And then after he was killed , they became my family . And , yes , Carlton was ... A little bit more than that . Well done , S. Christy : Oi ! S ! Some nerve showing your face around here . [ Laugh ] Oi , you geriatric wankers . Oh , Christy ! Kieran ! God love you , Siobhan . Oh , it 's so good to see you ! This is , um ... This is the band . Band ? How did you bastards even know I was here ? Trudy called . She recognized you from the pictures behind the bar . Your picture 's behind the bar ? Christy : Course it is . Used to light this place up every Friday night . Felix : Is that so ? - Oh , my God . - No reason we can 't do that again . There is every reason we can 't do it again . Come all this way just to say no to a song ? - Do it ! For us ? - Please . [ Beep ] [ Ringing tone ] [ Door opens ] Siobhan , I 've got something for you . Listen , I 'm just round the corner , so ask the barmaid for directions , yeah ? Ferdinand : Terrance . Good afternoon . Ferdinand . You scared the shite outta me . I thought that you were going to call me if Siobhan Sadler ever came to town . We had an understanding . Yeah , we did . I was just about to . Well ? Well , they just arrived , didn 't they ? Siobhan and her two kids . What 's the purpose of this little family holiday ? I don 't know . Sightseeing , I suppose . Reconnecting with old friends . Yeah !

And maybe you will tell me some truth . Okay . Now you come to me because now you believe your girlfriend is a mole for Castor . I don 't know whether she is or not , but I ... There are things about her that don 't line up anymore . Why should I help ? You resigned . You said I could never quit Dyad . You were right . I screwed up . I admit it . We 're in this bullshit together and we both need Castor gone . What are you not telling me ? That Sarah 's in London right now trying to kill the Castor original . - Oh , my God . - If Castor did translate the book , they 're gonna be right on her heels . We need to know who gave them that book . Then leave it with me . Donnie : Is it gonna hurt ? - Yes . - What ? Now , hold this . What is it ? It smells minty . This we make in convent when the nuns beat the demons from us . Oh . Never heard that story before . You have more interesting stories , Donnie Hendrick . Drug dealers and money , money , money , money . Tut , tut , tut , tut . I should never have gotten involved with Kellerman . But I lost my job , and Ali really wanted to run for trustee . You do this for your family . Now I gotta get us out of it . I 've gotta return the pills and get all our money back . And they took this tank thingy from under the counter . My babies ? - Excuse ... what ? - They took eggs from inside me , made them into babies , and put them frozen in the tank . I guess I never heard that story either . Where are they ? I will find them . No . No , no , no . I 'll get them . Helena , these are bad people . And besides , you walk a new path , remember ? Alison won 't like this . I don 't care . It 's a dad decision , for the family . And you 're part of it now . Siobhan : Terry ? [ Door opens ] Terry ? Oh , sh ... Terry ! I 'm here , pet , it 's Siobhan . Oh , my God . Terrance : I didn 't tell him nothing . Give me something to stop the bleeding ! Yeah . Terrance : They had me ... Twisted up for years . Who , love ? I just ... Gave them useless bits ... [ Cough ] To keep ' em at bay . I 'm here . The number . I didn 't tell ' em . But , pet , you need to know ... Siobhan : Oh , good God . S. Shit . Felix : Is he ... - S. - Mum . What do we do ? - We leave . - We go home . S , we need to find Castor . Siobhan : We lost our advantage . He said he found something . What ... Shut it . It 's not a debate . We are done . Felix : Come on , she 's right . We gotta go , okay ? Let 's go . Get back to the pub . I 'll take care of this . Just wait for me there . Do not move until I get there . What did he ... What did he find ? Felix , will you get her out of here ? Felix : Let 's go . Come on . Sarah . Yep . Bloody hell ! Let 's go ! Coming ! Sarah : We 're not going back . Did you not see the dead man back there ? Yes , which means they 're getting closer . All the more reason for us to get to the bottom of this shit . Where the hell did you get that ? Shh ! Terry said he found sommat , right ? So ... Terry 's dead , Sarah . If we call his people , we 'll find out what it was . Look , look , two ... Two times this number was called today . I don 't care ! I don 't like this . You should have given that to S. Shh , shh . [ Ringing tone ] Man : What you want now ? Uh ... I need to see ya . Who is this ? It 's Siobhan . You gotta be kidding me . Where are you ? A few blocks east of the Bayonet . In the square , in an hour . I 'll send someone . Great . That doesn 't sound ominous at all . You don 't have to come . Yeah , I do . 'Cause I need to know you 're safe ! Felix : I don 't like this . We should be doing this with S. Sarah : Then go back to the pub and wait for her there . Felix : And miss our clandestine meeting with a dangerous thug ? I need to figure out what 's going on . And what 's gonna happen when he figures out that you 're not who you said you are ? [ Gun cocks ] Oh , that 's bloody brilliant . Yeah , you got a better plan ? You Siobhan ? Come on , then . This is place ? Yup , this is place . I 'll be right back . [ Buzz ] Hey . [ Slam ] Senhor Pouzihno . Good to see you again . I don 't know what , uh , Jason Kellerman told you , but we had a bit of ... Actually , you know what , it doesn 't matter . So , this is everything that we got from you . Keep the bins , esta ' tudo bem . I just really need that tank back . I thought you didn 't know what it was . It 's private , okay ? All right , you know what ? It 's fertilized embryos . My wife and I are having a little trouble ... Pouchy : A sua arma esta ' vazia . [ Laugh ] I 'm sorry , what ? My gun ... Oh , I get it . Empty gun , shooting blanks . Yup ! That 's me . I just need that back , and also if you could see it in your heart , Mr. Pouzhino , to reimburse us for the pills , then ... We 'd be all squared away . [ Laughter ] [ Buzz ] It 's the wife . Alison . Honey , I said to wait in the car . You were taking a long time . I came to check up ... Husband . What 's up with your voice ? [ Cough ] I have a cold . Yeah , yeah . It 's one of those really bad ones that messes with your ... syntax . You know what ? Why don 't you just save your voice , honey , because Luisa here is going to give us the tank back . Donnie : Oh , so , Mr. Pouzhino . What about that refund ? Bubbles . You wash my money . There 's no refund , Mr. Hendrix . You work for my uncle now . Honey , we better go . We have your eggs . Come on . Luisa : Hey , don 't even think about getting back into business . We know where you live . We know where Oscar and Gemma go to school . Did you threaten babies ? Donnie : Alison , honey , let 's go . Let 's just get outta here , okay ? Hey ! Donnie : Alison ! No ! Ali , no ! No ! Open the door ! Stop ! You should not threaten babies . Donnie : Helena ! Helena ! Don 't do this ! What are you doing here ? You expected someone else ? That 's cute . Are you alone ? That 's none of your business , and you can 't just ... What is this ? Delphine : I don 't think Cosima 's coming back . Sit . Sit down ! Take off your shoes . What ? Why ? Take them off or they will . We 're going to have a conversation . And you 're going to tell me ... Everything . Felix : Sarah , why are we stopping here ? [ Parking brake ] Out with you , come on . I said come on , didn 't I ? Felix : Hey , hey , hey ! God . Wait ! Jesus ... Driver : We 're going to have a nice little chat , okay ? Hey , that 's enough ! You leave him alone ! I 'll let him go when you start talking . And don 't even think about pulling that gun out of your pants or I 'll snap this little tosser 's neck . - You 're the one that we called , then . - Yeah . And you 're not bleeding Siobhan , are you ? So talk . I 'm Sarah . Right ? He 's Felix . We belong to Mrs. S , to ... to Siobhan . We 're her foster kids . Sarah Manning ? Yeah , yeah . You know me ? Yeah . I helped to track you down 20-odd years back or so . I moved you about from place to place . You 're Kassov . So ... Where the bloody hell is your mum ? She ... She wanted Terry to help her find that prisoner . - You helped him . - Yeah , what of it ? We need to know what you found out . Friend of mine in the parole service sent me that . Geezer 's name is Malone . Went in in ' 78 . Kendall Malone . Aggravated homicide . Paroled 2007 . There 's an address on here , it 's current . Will you take us there ? Please . Yep , it 's great , Ali , yeah . Uh ... Gracie is at the doctor 's , I think , and , um ... yeah , yeah , I got it . Honey , I gotta go . Helena , what did you do ? I got refund . We should go now . Uh ... Get in the car . Get in the car ! Shay : I don 't know how many times I have to tell you , I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm not a corporate spy , Delphine . Jesus , I 've only been to your stupid lab once . You know , for someone of your income , the lease on this place is quite expensive . It 's none of your concern how I pay for things . If the money comes from Castor it is . From who ? Where is Cosima ? This is why she was acting so weird this morning . You 've gone all " single white female " on her . Delphine , why are you doing this ? [ Humming ] This is a bit more than we were owed . I do not think they will be coming back for change . [ Laugh ] Uh ... You might want to shower before Alison comes home . Yes , I will do this . Thank you for saving my babies . Alison : Oh , Donnie , there you are . You wouldn 't believe the day I had . What happened to your face ? Well , um ... The good news is we 've come into some money . What ? Like , a lot of money . - Oh , my God . - Yeah . You know , when I was at boarding school , there was a girl I knew ... Very well . And she attempted suicide . She slit her wrists in the bathtub . But it wasn 't enough . She should have cut the metatarsal arteries on the top of her feet too . [ Ringing tone ] Hello ? Cosima ? It 's Gracie Johanssen . Oh , hey Gracie . What 's up ? I just ... I just wanted to say thank you . You were ... You were very kind to me , and , um ... Please tell everyone that I 'm really sorry . Oh . What 's going on ? They told me that I could help save Mark . Oh , my God , it was you ? I 'm sorry . They told me we could be together . I love him . Scott , I made a huge mistake . Jealous bitch . You 're crazy . Tell me everything . I don 't know who Castor is . I 'm not working for anybody , okay ? [ Vibrating ] What is it ? Cosima : Hey , how 's it going ? Wonderful , I 'm ... Kind of busy . What do you need ? Uh , I 'm sorry , but the thing I said about Shay , it wasn 't her . It wasn 't her who ... Who took the book . Sarah : Do you think someone followed us ? Kassov : I don 't know . It looked like there was someone with us a ways back , but I lost ' em , didn 't I ? Now , then . That 's the place , that one there . Whatever you 're looking for , you better get on with it . - Thank you . - Yeah . It 's looking like old man Castor 's sound asleep . That will make this easier . Jesus Christ . Sarah . You 're really going to go in and kill an innocent old man ? You stay on the look out . You call me if anything happens . I 'll be here . Pissing my pants . [ Door opens ] Sorry , mate , ain 't taking fares . I 'm sure you 'll make an exception . [ Telephone ringing ] Hello , Ferdinand . I won 't keep you , but you 'll never guess who I 've been traipsing around London after . Sarah Manning . Now who 's been keeping secrets from Topside ? Last time I saw her , she was locked up at Dyad with you . Well , maybe we should talk . Excellent . Smooth things out between us . Balance out some of the leverage you had on me over Rachel . Why don 't you come visit the institute ? Good idea . [ Sigh ] What are you doing in my house ? - Easy . - You an addict ? Bleeding junkie ! No , no , I 'm looking for someone . I will sever your spine ! Where you going ? Where you going ? I 'm not going to hurt you ! Oh . Can you use that thing , little prat ? That 's the question . I 'm looking for Kendall Malone . Well , you got me . What ? You 're Kendall Malone ? S ! Siobhan : Put the gun down , Sarah . What ? Put it down , love . Siobhan ? Hello , mother . This is the prisoner we 're after ? Your mum ? Yeah , she is . Sent down for killing my John . John Sadler was a drunk and a pikey who plucked you from the cradle . I was 17 and done with you by 12 . I didn 't know the prisoner number was hers until Terry told me . Uh ... wh-where 's Castor ? I 'm wondering the same thing . Tell us , ma . Why would professor Duncan send us to you ? [ Exhales ] I knew this would come up one day . I was just hoping I 'd be dead . I swear , ma , you 'd better start talking . Shit . Duncan came through Newton testing the inmates . Cancer research , he said , but I knew it wasn 't . He did round after round , men and women , looking for a viable donor . And he found one , yeah ? A male donor ? Oh , he found his male . Just not where he expected . Well , who was it ? Did you know him ? Oh , I know him well . He 's me . [ Laugh ] What the hell are you talking about , ma ? I 'm special , you see . Absorbed a male twin in the womb when I was formed . I got two cell lines , me . Oh , my God . She 's the Castor original ? How 's that possible ? Hell of a twist of nature , isn 't it ? Shit . Shit , shit , Sarah , come on . S. Yeah . Time to go . What are you doing ? We need to destroy every shred of DNA in this house . We can 't leave a trace of her . Malone : Oh , there she goes , threatening to burn my house down again . Not just the house that has to go . Sarah : Jesus , S. You said it yourself , Sarah . Castor has to be stopped . But that 's your mum . This is what it 's come to , Siobhan ? Sarah : Castor and Leda are ... Are siblings , S. So what ? So if your mum has two cell lines , that means that she 's our original , too . We need her . She 's Leda .

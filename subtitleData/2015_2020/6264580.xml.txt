 Previously on stitchers ... How long have you been spying on me for ? The entire last year . I wouldn 't mind doing some fieldwork . The agency has people who handle the fieldwork . Unsocialized nerds and girls in catsuits need not apply . You must think i 'm an awful person . All things considered on certain occasions , I 'd say you 're ... Pretty remarkable . Oh , and i don 't think you 're an idiot . - Thanks . - You 're more of an imbecile . It 's so nice to finally meet you , kirsten . Kirsten : Did ed clark commit suicide ? - No . - How did he die ? Protecting you . Ed clark left this for me . It has a sequence of terms on it . Do you think you could try and decipher them for me ? Linus : Those digital codes on the cassette That ed gave you , they 're map coordinates . ( rock music playing ) ¶ everyone wants the best of me ¶ Camille : Where have you been all my life ? Who ? Not who . These boots . They 're sick ! They 're $ 500 . I think i 'm going to be sick . ( exhales ) Uh , you have that kind of money ? - No . - You don 't need new boots . But i deserve to treat myself every once in a while . You know , most government contractors make bank , We zap you into dead people 's memories to solve crimes . We should be paid accordingly . The program already pays us . Yeah , but there 's no surplus . And these have patent purple leather , tigers eye buttons , Antique brass ring detail , and a kitten spool heel . So , stop whining and ask for a raise like normal people do . You are telling me what normal people do ? Oh , and our hot water heater is on a blink , So take it easy with those long showers . You have no sense of time . How do you know how long i take in there ? Today was 23 minutes and seven seconds . ( knocking ) Okay , timing me in the shower is mega creepy . Mega . Like now i need another shower . Hello . Is kirsten home ? Why no , she is not . Liam ? I knew there was no point in trying to surprise you , But i hope you 're happy to see me . Of course i am . Come in . Um ... But i have to go . I don 't . Yes , we do . It 's for work . It 's urgent . Do what you have to do . You mind if i hang here till you get back ? Make yourself at home . Hi . - Camille . - Bye . Okay , spill now . Who is liam ? My boyfriend . Wait , what ? ( theme music playing ) ¶ take me inside ¶ ¶ take me inside ¶ Our sample is a jane doe , early 20s . She was found by hikers On a trail beneath mulholland drive . There is evidence of a scuffle by the side of the road above . You mean she was pushed . That 's what the l.A.P.D. Believes . - That 's horrible . - Yes , it is . But we can 't fine her killer Until we identify her . Any questions ? I have one . Since when does kirsten have a boyfriend ? " boyfriend " ? I think maggie meant any relevant questions . Correct . Get to work . Camille , let 's talk . ( mouthing words ) Yes , i know . Relevant questions from here on . Spare me the lecture . " boyfriend " ? Oh , so the magster likes to dish . Okay , his name is liam , and he is drop-dead delicious . What do you know about him ? Nothing . He just showed up at our door this morning Like a little slice of heaven . Meanwhile , kirsten has never mentioned him . Okay . Find out everything you can about him . I want a full report . Uh , actually ... I 'm not comfortable with that . Excuse me ? Well , when you first recruited me to spy on kirsten , I didn 't know her , but now that we 're- - Ugh , friends . Yeah , it just doesn 't feel right . Mm . We pay you to complete your assignments- - Which right now is about liam- - Not to spy on kirsten , but to protect her . That 's what friends do . Entiendo . Speaking of pay , now might not be The best time- - and it isn 't . Not comfortable with that either so ... - Medical . - Go . - Communications . - Yep . We 're a go . - Sub-bio . - Go . - Life-sci . - We are a go . Comm check . One , two , one , two . I hear you . Tim , how we looking ? Awesome . Okay , kirsten , once inside the memory , Try to focus on finding us a name for jane doe , huh ? Will do . Let 's hit the road already . " roads " ? Where we 're going , we don 't need roads . Initiate stitch neurosync on my mark . Three ... Two ... One ... Mark . ( dance music playing ) Cameron : Talk to me . Where 'd the memories pull you ? Right into a hot tub . There she is . I see her . Jane doe is here partying with friends . The place is beautiful . So jane doe 's rich . Or just friends with someone who is . Best fourth of july ever ! It 's fourth of july . ¶ i 'm the boss man , i 'm the head of the committee ¶ ¶ lay the law down , got the keys to the city ¶ I 'm in the house with them now . Find some identifiers . An address or ... Somethin ' . ( barking ) Giorgio , stop it . No . No , baby . Come on . She 's got a little yip-yip dog . - Aw . - We need a name . Uh , sunshine , we need a name . - For the dog ? - For jane doe . She 's taking selfies with an issue of mulholland magazine . I think it 's her house on the cover . Camille , pull up archives for mulholland magazine . On it . This place is wired with all the bells and whistles . Lots of expensive art . Even in the bathroom . I 'm in a different bathroom now . How many bathrooms does this place have ? ( alarm blaring ) 45 seconds . 45 seconds . Different how ? It- - it doesn 't belong in the same place As the first , it 's old . Shabby . 30 seconds . Make the bounce , ace . " iheartlinus . " Sorry , i never got her name . Any idea who killed her ? No . All her friends seemed happy . She was just a rich girl that liked to party . - ( whistles appreciatively ) - camille : Talk about curb appeal . Do people actually live like that ? One percent of the one percenters . There . That one . That 's the issue she was waving around . Camille : " living large with joe and susan parks . " - Are there any photos from inside the house ? - Sure . Look ... That their closet ? That 's twice the size of my bedroom . And it doesn 't have little clown letters That spell out " linus " over the door . Kirsten , is that the same house ? Yeah , i 'm sure . Okay , kirsten and cameron , you 'll come with me to verify the place . Well , what about fisher ? Fisher is on special assignment . I thought we were a special assignment . The agency needed him elsewhere . Oh , fantastic . We haven 't had a vague answer in almost 10 minutes . We don 't need help . Firstly , neither one of you have a badge . Yet . Secondly , someone may have to break Some very bad news to two parents . Hey , fisher , it 's me . I know you 're on some sort of agency thing , But i was right , and you were wrong . Ed clark didn 't commit suicide , He was murdered . Call me . What was that all about ? How vague do you want your answer ? Kirsten , may i remind you that we 're both On the same team . We going in ? Okay , so the situation requires tact and discretion . Maybe you should wait outside . Maybe you should bite me . Clearly you two will let me do all the talking . Ugh , even his passport photo is delicious . Wow . World traveler . Ugh , what a total do-gooder . I hate him ... I hate him ... I love him . - ( door opens ) - ooh ! Hey there ! It 's liam , right ? Camille , we met earlier , sort of . Well , it 's nice to make it official . Go out for a little run , i see . Just a short one today . The hills around here are a challenge . Can i get you and the boys something to drink ? Tap is fine . Well , don 't hear that very often . Not in l.A. Anyway . It 's easy to forget how lucky we are To turn a faucet and fill a glass with fresh water . That 's so true . Thanks . And thanks for letting me stay here . This place is a palace Compared to what i 've been used to . Which is ? A hut in peru this last year . And before that a yurt in southeast asia . ( scoffs ) Shut the front door . A yurt by choice ? Well , i 'm a cultural anthropologist , So i need to immerse myself in different ways Of life , so i can contribute something Positive to the local community . And you ? Me ? Oh , i don 't do anything to help mankind . I 'm completely self-absorbed . So where does kirsten fit in all of your good-doing ? She doesn 't . At least not the way i 'd like her to . We met three years ago , i 've asked her on a few trips , But she has her own goals of course , So we end up spending a lot of time apart . That 's terrible . Fortunately , time doesn 't mean anything to her , So we just pick up where we left off . I love that about her . Don 't you ? Totally . ( clears throat ) She lives in the moment as we all should . Just one of the many things that makes Kirsten so ... Damn lovable . Thank you . Look familiar ? Kirsten : Looks identical . This is the house . Hello . Sorry to keep you waiting . I 'm special agent maggie baptiste . I 'm on an assignment with l.A.P.D. - And you are ... - Oh , we 're , um- - Graduate students of criminology and forensics . We 're tagging along . What she said . Mr. And mrs . Parks , i 'm sorry , i have bad news to share with you . The body of a young woman , early 20s , Brunette , five foot four , was found on a hiking trail below mulholland . Someone was killed in our neighborhood ? I- - i 'm so sorry . How can we help ? We believe that she lived here . That 's impossible . Do you have a daughter ? No , it 's just suzanne and i . Fourth of july , where were you ? I 'm sorry , are you studying Forensics or interrogation ? We have reason to believe that the victim hosted a party Here on the fourth of july . We were out of town that weekend . I was at a spa in oheim , My husband was in portland . So it 's possible the victim knew Your house would be empty . The alarm company would have notified us If someone broke in . Not if they bypassed the alarm . I 'm sure i would know if a bunch of strangers Held a party in my home . We must have the wrong house . No . I saw that hallway , the couch , the sculpture , - It 's all- - - excuse ... I 'm sorry , you saw- - She means the um ... Photo spread in mulholland magazine . - Oh . - What are you hiding ? Kirsten ! We 're not hiding anything , and i resent the accusation . Mr. Parks : Here 's a name i want you to remember : Jonathan tuckman . His firm is franklin and tuckman in century city . He 's my lawyer . Any more questions , talk to him . Sorry to disturb you . We will find our way out . - But i know- - - kirsten . I 'm sorry about that . She 's the worst student in our program . Beautiful home . Maggie : Cameron ! Gotta go . Maggie : Tact and discretion are not in your vocabulary . - Told you . - I know what i saw . In a dead girl 's memory . Do you want to explain that to those people ? I 'm not wrong . There is one thing i know for sure , Nothing and no one is foolproof . Whatever kirsten 's seen in the stitch she 's aways Been able to piece together , so she may not be foolproof , But she 'll do until foolproof shows up . Fabulous speech . Get in the car . ( elevator ding ) Hey ! How 'd everything go at the mansion ? Badly . The parks have no idea who jane doe is . She 's not a jane doe anymore . You made the i.D. ? Well , the only thing they found in her pockets Were her keys ... And this . A plastic bag ? Or a doggy poop bag . I know you mentioned you saw a dog in the stitch . Well , where there 's a poop bag , there 's gotta be a dog . So i did a search and i got a hit- - Bel air animal shelter . Meet giorgio . Aw , he 's so cute . Well , someone just found him wandering and turned him in . Oh , he 's sweet . ( barking ) I- - i saw him barking at a guy in the stitch . Luckily he was chipped . That 's his owner . Brenda miller . She goes by bentley miller on twitter and facebook . - Nice work . - Thank the pooch . He 's wandering all alone in this world ... Filled out the papers for adoption . I cannot tell my parents . Kirsten : Forget the dog , where 's bentley 's keys ? ( door shutting ) We 're a long way from mulholland . Thought you said she was rich . It seemed like it . So who 's liam ? Um ... Boyfriend . Sort of . Boyfriend adjacent . He travels a lot . Hmm . Long distance relationships are hard . Yeah , not- - not for me . Right . I mean , when he 's here it 's fine , And when he 's gone , it 's like he 's always Been away . I never miss him . You 're the ultimate no-strings girlfriend . Whoa , someone dreamed about living large . Meanwhile , all she has is junk . Nothing worth killing over . ( rattling ) That on the other hand , might be . Maggie : There 's been a series of break-ins of homes near mulholland drive . No leads until the jewelry you found Was linked to those burglaries . That 's maggie for " thank you . " All right well , i spoke to bentley 's family in kansas . Apparently , she moved out here to become rich and famous . I guess breaking into homes was part of her business plan . Let 's not play " blame the victim . " We know who she was and what she was involved in . Why was she killed ? She might 've gotten tangled with an accomplice , Someone she tried selling the stolen goods to , Or ... Someone she stole from . No , i think she kept it all . I mean , that jewelry made her feel better about herself . It made her feel like she mattered . I searched bentley 's social media presence . Her one friend was in a lot of photos with her . She was near the hot tub with bentley . Yeah , this is sadie morton . She works at a high-end spa in beverly hills . I 'm pushing her " deets " out to everyone right now . Oh hey ! K 's got a hot dinner tonight . We 're in the middle of a case . Cameron , how long until the refractory period is up ? - Six hours . - So we 'll call you if we need you . Right , maggie ? Make sure that you can be reached . Cameron , why don 't you go see What you can find out about sadie morton ? - Where are you going ? - I was coming with you . - I don 't need any help . - I 'll keep you company . Dude i- - i 've never been to a spa before . - Fine . - All right . - We can get mani-pedis . - You 're kidding , right ? We 'll call you if we need you . Enjoy your dinner with liam , Just don 't show up wearing that . Liam ? Hey . Look at you . Look at you . Aren 't we going out ? Well i thought so , but i went to take a shower , And there was no hot water . Yeah . I need to get the heater fixed . Not anymore . I fixed it . Really ? Thank you . Then i figured i would whip up some dinner , And we could hang here . Oh . Unless you 'd rather go out . You know , it 's um ... It 's just that i bought all this stuff for tonight . This is for you . Okay , thanks so much , But i can 't accept this . This is too expensive . Are you okay ? Yeah , of course . Why ? The clothes , the makeup . You usually keep it ... Simple . Mm . Yeah , i had a weird day at work , And i think it 's affecting me . What are you doing for work these days ? Oh , you know me . Just geek computer stuff . It pays the bills . Well , you 're home now . Relax . I 've missed you . And i know in your way you 've missed me , too . ¶ i can feel ¶ ¶ it all rushing back in ¶ I asked you to find out about liam , Not make sure kirsten could spend more time with him . Look , i did the requested snooping . I searched the internet , i even scoured the deep web , Liam granger , totally clean . There are no red flags . This guy is like the lovechild between brad pitt and mother teresa . I checked his junk , i ... Looked through his personal items , And i got you some photos . The point is , if kirsten wasn 't Dating liam , i 'd be all over him . - Oh ! Um- - - yes ? Can we switch gears for a second and talk about my- - - No . - Okay . Okay great , we 'll see you this afternoon . Hello , gentlemen . I 'm sorry , we 're only seeing women right now . Awesome . Actually , we need to talk to sadie morton . May i ask what it 's regarding ? We are here on official business . She 's with a client right now . Would you like to wait for her in the harmony room ? It 's out and to the right . Thank you . Where did you get that ? Comic-con . - Imperial police . - Mm-hmm . ( chairs humming ) - Linus ? - Yeah ? Why does a girl trust a guy Who disappears for two years And then suddenly reappears ? You 're asking me ? I don 't know , you and camille Kind of sort of had that thing . Kind of sort of clearly doesn 't make Me an expert on women . - Hi . - Oh ! Hi . Um , we 're um ... With the police . I know . We need to ask you a few questions about bentley miller . It 's so sad . I can 't believe bents is gone . Her mom called me . It 's just awful . Where were you last night ? Wait , you think i killed her ? I think the two of you broke into people 's houses and stole from them . Oh my ... Am i under arrest ? Depends how the next few minutes go , ma 'am . I 'm the bad cop in this relationship . Okay , we called it " house sitting " - - Breaking into houses to party . But we only did it when people we out of town . We never hurt anyone . And you stole from them . No ! No . At least i didn 't . We just wanted to know how it felt like to have everything we wanted , Even if it was just for a little bit . Only thing is , bentley got greedy . I gave bentley the info on who was gonna be Out of town , and she disarmed the alarm systems . I have a lot of wealthy clients here . Did you break into joe and suzanne parks ' house ? Yes . We were partying and mr . Parks came home . We got out of there , but bentley couldn 't . She was trapped inside there with him for hours . Parks lied . He wasn 't out of town . Miss morton , we 're gonna have to ask you to stay in town . At most , we 're gonna need your cell phone number Just in case we have any more interrogating to do . What ? Or not . You 're dismissed . I 'm calling kirsten . You 're just a chicken . ( romantic music playing ) ( phone buzzing ) ( knocking rapidly ) Oh ! Hey . Why haven 't you answered your phone ? Um ... - Been busy . - Busy doing what ? Hello , mate . Hello . Liam , cameron . - Hi . - Hi . I- - i didn 't mean to interrupt . I was , um ... Just haven 't answered your phone , And we kind of need you at the office . It 's , um ... Kind of an emergency . Okay . Sorry . I 'll be quick . Excuse me for a second . Sure . So what do you do for work exactly ? Oh ! Um ... ( sniffs ) do i smell matsutake ? Yeah , good nose . It 's matsutake mushroom risotto to be exact . But those mushrooms aren 't in season . But i have friends in fungal places . Oh . - You should try some . - Oh , no . It 's fine . Oh- - okay . It 's actually not bad . Sorry , liam . I 'll be back as soon as i can . I understand . Wait just one second . So ... That 's liam . - Your point ? - No point . The risotto was a little undercooked , though . But he seems like a decent enough fellow . - You 're different around him . - How so ? Just more of a betty , less of a veronica . Oh , so i 'm usually a veronica , and around liam i 'm a betty ? Yeah . So what does that make you ? Archie ? Or reggie ? Possibly jughead . So you 're not worried about messing up anything With the stitchers program , your friends ? Oh ... Oh wait , you think liam is a threat to that ? ( scoffs ) Why can 't i have all that and also liam ? Why can 't i have it all ? Liam : Dessert . To go . Thanks . You 're amazing . Lights at 20 % , please . Com check . One , two . Talk to me , betty . Yes , jughead . I hear you . - Linus , what are they talking about ? - I don 't know , But i thought i was jughead . Cameron : All systems are go . We are in the pipe five by five . Initiate stitch neurosync on my mark . Three , two , one ... Work . I 'm in the parks mansion in a huge bedroom . Someone 's home ! ( woman laughing ) ( kissing ) Joe parks just brought another woman into the bedroom . With bentley there ? She 's hiding . ( indistinct mumbling ) She 's videoing them on her phone . ( moaning ) ( footsteps ) I 'm now on mulholland . Bentley is here walking giorgio . ( car door opens ) Wait . ( car door shuts ) ( loud beeping ) Her adrenaline is spiking . Someone 's coming . The price just went up . You better pay or this is going public . 30 seconds till the bounce . - What 's happening ? - They 're fighting . Who 's bentley fighting with ? Kirsten , who 's fighting with her ? I can 't tell . ( screams , thuds ) I 'm bouncing . - Exit pin code . - " iheartliam . " I mean linus . " iheartlinus . " I never got a good look at who pushed her , Someone in a peacoat and gloves . But bentley recorded joe parks having an affair , And then blackmailed him . - He must have killed her . - Yeah . But now we know not for what she stole , For what she saw . Well i think it 's time for the l.A.P.D. To bring joe parks in . Camille : But his name is already giorgio . Yeah i know , but what kind of name is giorgio ? What were you thinking of changing it to ? Abhishek , mahesh , swaminathan ... You know , something totally normal . Okay , people . Mr. Parks is in custody . He lawyered up , but they found evidence That he had texted bentley the week before she was murdered , So job well done . Cameron : This calls for celebration . Dinner ? My place ? 7 : 00 p.M. ? I 'm cooking . So is liam . Sorry . He 's cooking tonight for camille and i . And he cooks too ! He 's amazing . It 's a consensus . Not a problem . Tapas for one it is . Make it two . I 'll bring beer . I thought you were picking up giorgio tonight . The shelter just texted me . Apparently giorgio hates men , Gets all tasmanian devil and barks and stuff . I got rejected as a potential owner . Oh , i 'm sorry linus . Bro night ? I got him . Go . Have fun with lance ! Linus : His name is liam . I know his name . Marcona almonds , quince paste , Dried apricots , fig marmalade , - And ... - Grapes . Yum . Well then why did you call him " lance " ? What do you think of the fig marmalade ? - It 's figgy . - Mm-hmm . ( clears throat ) Why don 't you like liam ? Who said i don 't like liam ? You referred to him as something you do To a boil on a person 's neck . Mm-hmm . Refill ? Somebody 's jealous ! Dude- - okay . The guy has been gone for two years And just randomly shows up out of the blue , okay ? I 'm worried . I don 't want kirsten to get hurt . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Wait . Do you think liam is one of those guys ? Dude ! He 's perfect . He 's got this , you know , perfect smile , and his ... Perfect abs . Wait , you saw his abs ? And he 's this total do-gooder , Just dedicated to saving the planet . Did i mention that ? Wait , wait . Back up , back up . You saw his abs ? It 's this total like ... Greek god six-pack thing . Okay . Yeah , you should be worried . Okay , and who has time to research Social and cultural phenomena around the world and work out ? Well what does the internet say about him ? I didn 't check . I don 't want to be one of those guys . Well , good thing for you , i am . - What 's his last name ? - Granger . Liam granger . What ? Oh . Oh this ... Is not good . I knew it . Tell me- - no , don 't . - Ah ! - Okay , tell me . It 's all true . Liam is perfect . Liam is perfect . Mm-hmm . ( dinging ) Oh ! That 's our saffron-infused rice . Dude , screw the saffron . You know what we need ? To do 1,000 sit ups and start a foundation for starving children ? No , we- - we need a real bro night . - But this is real . - This is faux bro . We need real bro ! No . No way . ( gasps ) The boots ? For me ? From you ? Shut up ! You said you wanted them . Well , want them ? I want to marry them , But they 're way way too expensive . - I can 't . - Don 't worry . Liam fixed the water heater , Which saved us way more than those boots cost , so ... Okay . I know you 're not a hugger , But ... And you ! Thank you , handsome for the water heater and for making Kirsten more awesome than she already ... Was ? Is ? Are those fried cheesy rice balls ? ( barking ) ( barking ) Ignore cujo . Hand me your balls . Thank you so much . ( sniffs ) Mr. Parks didn 't kill bentley . The dog was with her on mulholland- - Girl talk . I am so sorry . Just one sec . Uh ... Linus said giorgio hates men , That he barks like crazy around them . But in the stitch , the dog wasn 't barking . So whoever was with bentley , whoever killed her was a woman . Everything okay ? No . Um ... Camille and i work at- - we work at a company That creates video games , and i just realized There 's a major glitch in one of the levels . Mr. Parks is not the right killer in the game . Ugh ! And we have to go reprogram . Can dinner wait ? You 're going to leave me again ? - It 's just a game . - It 's a very important game . I will loop cameron and linus in . Ah . Seriously- - i mean , these boots Are just like ... Who needs a man ? Who needs a woman when you 've got pizza , beer , and a 4k l.E.D. Tv ? ( video game noises ) Tell me again why i 'm here ? Because it 's bro night , and you 're our newest bro . Yeah . ( gasps ) Whoa . Um , how do you spell " profoundly bad frickin ' idea " ? - Just as it sounds . - How do you know they 're not home ? I checked the motion sensors on the alarm system . They 're out . Okay , but even if you do find The gloves you saw the killer wearing , What are you gonna do ? It 's inadmissible as evidence . Until we tell maggie where we found them , Then she gets a warrant and goes in and finds them ... Again ... The gloves will both have bentley 's dna And the dna of the killer on them . They 're the key to this . Okay , but speaking of key , what about the alarm ? It 's a secure assist 200 . I clocked it when i was here with maggie . A notoriously easy to hack system . How notoriously easy to hack do you think- ( beeping ) - ( door unlocks ) Nevermind . Okay . Let 's split up . I 'll check the bedroom , you look down here . Right . ( yelling ) go , go ! Pick up the health pack ! What are you doing ? He 's right there ! - ( explosion ) - oh ! No ! Are you- - That 's absolutely incredible ! - Best 27 out of 53 ? - Bring it . Yes . ( machine gun noises ) To bro night ! Oh ! Ain 't nothing downstairs . Check the drawers in the bedroom . I 'm still in the closet . ( scoffs ) Not with liam around you ain 't . Who are you ? I can explain , i think . How did you get in here ? Smartphone , Not so smart home security system . Don 't move . I 'm calling the police . And when they get here , you can tell them how you killed bentley . My husband killed that girl . You 're that forensics student . Your husband is innocent . You killed bentley and framed him . You used his cellphone to text bentley . - You can 't prove that . - No . Not yet . - But i will . - You don 't know what you 're talking about . Your husband didn 't have an affair , you did . Bentley recorded you . The woman in the video , she was wearing this . That woman was you . You knew if your husband found out , He 'd dump you , and you would lose everything . And you were greedy . But bentley was greedier . And when she upped the price to turn over the video , You killed her and pinned it on your husband . - ( chuckles ) - ( clears throat ) How much do you girls want ? Because money solves everything in your world ? Just tell me what you need to keep your mouths shut . We don 't need anything except this . My jewelry ? Fine . Take it all . Oh , no . You keep your filthy necklaces , And your bracelets , and your diamonds . All i need is this . And all i need is this . You okay ? ( music playing ) Need anything else ? - A girlfriend . - What about camille ? A reliable girlfriend . Someone who 's not gonna Get all flustered at the sight of liam 's abs . Do you want my opinion ? Dating is too much of a hassle . I know . I feel you , bro . You know what i think we need ? A girl-fast . A total break from women . - Right this second it starts . - Immediately . We should work on awakening our kundalini . Yeah , we should- - we should definitely Awaken whatever that is you just said . We awaken it and harness our power by abstaining from sex . Yeah . No sex . No sex . It 's not like you guys are getting any , anyway . Get out . ¶ put the pedal to the metal and go ¶ ¶ the yellow madellow with slicks on sending ' em home ¶ ¶ stick cars in the concrete , gripping the road ¶ ¶ so quick , get in the palm trees , look out , whoa ¶ Next time , you will call someone Before going out on your own . Totally . And despite your slight errors in logistical judgment , Good job . Thanks . I 'm gonna grab our things . Okay , third time 's the charm . Enough of a good job to warrant , say , a raise ? You 've earned it in more ways than one . So how much do you want ? Hold please . ( chuckling ) Done . - Wait , can i add a zero ? - Don 't push it . So what did you find on liam ? Camille thoroughly vetted his credentials . They all checked out . Perfectly . Too perfectly ? A year ago , liam was awarded An n.S.F. Post-doctoral fellowship in emerging third world cultures . - Impressive . - And worrisome . Here 's a picture of him receiving the award . You think it 's him . It 's hard to tell from the picture , But my gut says , " yes , " and if there is even a chance ... Flash drive . I 'll take care of it , you ... I 'll keep an eye on liam . ( door closes ) What 's that ? - Key to something . - Key to what ? I 'm not quite sure yet . ( laughs ) Kirsten clark , you continue to be an unexpected mystery to me . A beautiful one , though . I mean it , kirsten . You 're beautiful . Just like this . No layers of makeup , No fancy dresses ... Just you . Thank you . You may not feel it they way i do when we 're apart , But i know how right it feels when we 're together . Me too . Will you marry me ? ( theme music playing ) ¶ take me inside ¶

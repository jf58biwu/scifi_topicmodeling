SHADDID : I have something for you . Little lost daughter case . ( WHISTLES ) MILLER : So what 's my contract exactly ? Find Julie Mao . If she 's still here on Ceres , detain her and ship her home . Kidnap job . My pleasure . Anybody grew up this far from the sun won 't give a good goddamn what planet you 're from . Real sky over your head and real gravity holding you on the ground , they don 't trust you . That distress call we never received , it was logged with HQ . Holden , you 'll head up this rescue , or salvage . Put a shuttle team together . So , just for the record , guys , I don 't wanna be here right now . NAOMI : This must be the beacon that called us . ALEX : Forwarding you an A-1 tight beam from the Canterbury . MAN : Torpedo launch ! HOLDEN : Canterbury , burn like hell , you got incoming . Real lemon works best , if you could ever get your hands on one . It 's a crucial part of the formula . Neutralizes acidity , adds body , balances pH . Something like that . Here .

Well , let 's not make it 55 . Alex , I 'm telling you to go after that ship . What if they don 't like being followed ? They slip off that screen , they 're gone forever . They 'll get away with this . What is wrong with you ? I gave an order ! You think rank matters now ? Get up , I 'll do it myself . Get up ! NAOMI : We 're not going anywhere .

You seem pretty sure about that . BOUILLOTTE DEALER : Water means life . One shipment late , you got protests . Two shipments late , you got dead people in the street . And it 's gonna get worse .

I tried to give you the best of all worlds , and you choose to live like some filthy handmaid among the riff-raff of the Solar System .

Jesus . Spare me . Show me my replies . JULIE : You 're so blind and so condescending and you 're never gonna change . If you won 't take yourself seriously as an adult , then why should I care about being your child ? You want to sell The Razorback ? Do it . You can 't buy me off or control me anymore . Maybe what you hate about me the most is that I remind you of yourself . ( DOOR CREAKING ) ( SIGHS ) ( CLATTERING ) Keep it up , partner . You 'll get there . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ) _ Is it true that you had a Belter up on hooks for 20 hours ? He 's an O.P.A. smuggler and a terrorist . The Secretary-General ... He didn 't want to talk ... The Secretary-General has publicly disavowed gravity torture . If you want to talk to that Belter , you put him in the tank . You know who I am ? I 've heard of you , yes . Many interesting tales . You 're well-spoken for an O.P.A. soldier . Because I 'm a Belter , I 'm naturally O.P.A. ? ( SCOFFS ) I 'm just a citizen of the Belt . I work for the future of my people as you do for yours . Then for the future of both our people , I need to know how you got your hands on restricted stealth technology that could destroy the balance in the system . You mean the balance between Earth and Mars . Either way , it 's a lousy deal for Belters . The O.P.A. demands legitimacy through violence . They haven 't earned it any other way . No ? You talk to me through a piece of glass , you see my body which can no longer survive on the very planet that bore my great-grandmother . ( INHALES ) Earth has created a race of exiles out in space , who have no homes to return to . Should this go unanswered ? I don 't mean to make you afraid , madame . Have I given you the impression that I 'm afraid ? Then why waste your time on a meaningless courier like myself ? You 're too modest , child . Someone entrusted you to transport pieces of the holy grail . The question is , who ? There are places far worse than this . And I imagine there is a mother somewhere who 'll love to see her boy again . Est cela ça , madame . I understand . We all have our duty . _ We 've got a dead radio and about four hours of oxygen left . Alex , how much burn do we have ? ALEX : I could get us maybe a third of the way to Ganymede Station , maybe . Or get us right to the edge of the shipping lanes , and then we 'd have to pray someone tripped over us . AMOS : It won 't happen . With a dead transponder , we 're just like space trash . What 's wrong with the radio ? Board 's cooked , and I 'm guessing the antenna array up top has seen better days . HOLDEN : See if you can improvise another board . I 'm gonna go outside and see what 's what . Great . We 'll wait here . I don 't mean to be a bad news bull or anything , but the airlock 's done . The outer door 's gone . Then we 'll have to vent the ship . Are you outta your tree ? We 'll lose all oxygen in the cabin . Everything depends on fixing that radio . We 're wasting time . There you go . Calling the shots again . I 'm going outside . You got a problem with that ? Amos , go with him . Whoa ! ( STUTTERING ) Let 's just hold on for one second . We don 't have to go outside . ( STUTTERING ) We 're safe right now . We open those doors , we 're done . The ship could crack apart . I 'm telling you ... - Shed ? - I 'm just ... If we open those doors ...

WOMAN : ( OVER PA ) Your attention , please . The Air , Water and Power ... JOON : Well , it 's about time . Expected you an hour ago . It 's a long hoof from the Medina , sir . A week ago , those dead patches started appearing . My guess is , the Greigas are stealing water again . Some Belters clearly don 't respect the green space 's role in recycling the air and the water . Not to mention the embarrassment it causes the Governor . You seem sure it was Belters . The criminals here tend to be . You 're new here , aren 't you ? We 'll get right on that , sir . Maybe if everyone in Ceres had this view , they 'd respect you more . There . Now , you can make your own view . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) ( CLANKING ) HOLDEN : Oh , shit ! ( HEAVY BREATHING ) You 're an Earther . And I don 't even know where you 're from .

Yet you 're accountable to no one . How does that happen ? This boy isn 't some hapless smuggler . I believe the O.P.A may be trying to obtain stealth weapons . Everything is not an O.P.A. plot and if Earth can 't afford a stealth program , how can a bunch of rock-tossers ? They can 't ... Unless they 've found a new friend like Mars .

REPORTER : ... continues to appear for the freighter Canterbury which disappeared while responding to a distress call . The Canterbury was reported to be carrying ice , bound for Ceres station .

( SCOFFS ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Good golly , Ms. Mao . You sure can pick ' em . Find your lost heiress yet ? ( SIGHS ) Well ... She 's not on Ceres . Shipped out on the Scopuli . It just went dark right after take-off . Vanished . The week for vanishing ships . You 'd think a rich girl like her would 've had that birthmark fixed . I don 't know . If it was a birthmark , her parents would have had it fixed . That 's a scar . I don 't think she wanted it fixed . Why do you say that ? Oh , it 's a badge of defiance . Against everything she 's supposed to be . Wow . She tell you that herself ? Yeah , she did . Listen , we 're the only ones who know what happened to the Cant . We get on that ship and chances are we 're never comin ' out . Unless ... NAOMI : What are you doing ? HOLDEN : Buying us insurance . My name is James Holden , speaking for the five survivors of the Canterbury . Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus SOS from a ship called the Scopuli . We recovered a false beacon and identified it as Martian Naval technology . - It was a trap . - Are you insane ? We are about to be taken aboard the MCRN Donnager . - NAOMI : Alex , shut him down ! - He 's locked us out . ALEX : He 's locked us out ! Hey , whoa , whoa ! NAOMI : You don 't speak for us . We intend to cooperate and hope this means we won 't be harmed . AMOS : Should I smoke him ? Say the word . We 're dead anyway . Any such action will only confirm that the Canterbury was destroyed by Mars . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) It just needs to reach one ship , one station . Then it 'll spread . ALEX : Don 't count on it . Their jammers were in range . ( SHIP RATTLES ) ( CRACKLING ) MARTIAN GUARD : You are prisoners of the Mars Congressional Republic . Move and you die .

 I 've told them to look again . I thought Isabella only killed bad men . That 's what she said . People who deserved it . He was the best of men . So who 's next ? Could be anyone . I won 't let there be anyone else . No ? How you gonna stop her ? What happened to Jay ? I tried . I really tried to stop him . He 's dead ? Jay was not strong enough . He 's not like you . Harry , it 's yours . It 's meant for you . If you don 't have ... Anna 's taken me back . And Daisy has never been happier . I will fight Isabella , I can beat her without risking them in the process . For the first time in , I don 't know how long , I 'm not looking - over my shoulder ... - If you don 't have it ... I can go home without thinking that something terrible is gonna happen . ... you 're normal again . - Yes . - So how will you beat her ? You 've no chance without this . I don 't want it . Ok , everyone ... Can I have your attention please ? Listen up . I 've just come from a meeting with the Assistant Commissioner and the powers that be . For now , I am taking charge . I don 't wanna be in this position . I 'm as upset here as anyone else . But we 've got no time for that , no time for grieving . Alright ? We 've only one case . Drop everything else . DCI Winter 's death was not an accident . It was murder . Carefully planned and pre-meditated to make it look like an accident . By her . Isabella Augustine . I don 't know if that 's her real name but I have an address for her , we have her details from a previous arrest . She 's got one known associate , a driver called Rui Hirota . He drives a black Range Rover , index plate is OY16YTK . We need to get officers to her place now . I want S019s . I want roadblocks , in case we 've missed her . I want men on the street . A cordon around her house . Come on ! Oh , and I have to be there . We 've got no chance of catching her , unless I am there . I know her , okay ? Harry . We all loved him . This doesn 't need to be your personal crusade . Hum-hum ! - Armed police ! - Get on the ground ! - Show your hands ! - Get down on the floor ! What the hell is going on ? I keep telling you , I 've never heard of anyone called Isabella Whatserface . This is my home . Where have you been the last three months ? Holiday . Oh , gardening leave actually . Left the old firm , decided to take the family on a rather special trip . Tokyo , Maldives ... And you don 't know her ? No . I 've never heard of her . You didn 't rent this place out while you were away ? What and risk someone damaging the artwork ? No thanks . So , you 're telling me ... Look , I know you cops aren 't the brightest bunch otherwise you 'd get decent jobs , but for the last time , I live here . I got back this morning . The place is just as I left it . I 've never heard of your girl . I can 't help you . Is that clear enough ? Just to keep you updated . Her photo 's on all police and NCA watchlists . We 've got eighteen search patrols on the streets , and I 've got a special unit manning CCTV . No one can hide for long with all that . We will get her . I 'm gonna go home , to get some sleep . Orwell 's doing the night shift , but when you are ready , I want to know all about Isabella Augustine . Thank you . - Anna ... - I just heard . I 'm so sorry . Was it her ? Yeah . You alright ? Yeah . No , I 'm fi , just err , got a lot to organise . Why are you here ? Am I allowed to tell you you look like shit ? You could lie . Daisy 's at a friend 's tonight . It 's just us . No , I need to stay here , in case we find her . No , alright . We can , we can stay nearby , we can go to a hotel . A hotel ? Harry , you have to rest . Just for one night , otherwise you 'll be no use to anyone . Least of all Alistair . I didn 't mean to wake you , I 'm sorry . You didn 't . The bed was cold , that 's all . She 's out there . Somewhere . You can 't catch her stuck in here . I don 't know how to catch her , Anna . But she has to be stopped ... for Winter . For everyone . I 'm the only person who can do it . - But I need ... - Some luck . I know . But I love you . But you have to catch her . But I love you . She has to be stopped . Do you really want this ? It 's my choice . I know what I 'm doing . When you put the bracelet back on , you sacrifice all the things you love . It has to be worth something . Just get on with it . Are you ready ? Anna ? Anna ? Anna ? - What ? - Get up ! Get up ! - What time is it ? - We have to get Daisy ! - It 's four in the morning . - Isabella is here . I saw her . She saw the bracelet . You did it ! She 's gonna come for you . I know it . Or Daisy , or ... Look , we need to go now . Rich ? Rich , are you there ? Rich ? Okay , all set ? Will you be alright ? I will if we catch her . Yeah , well , look after Harry . Relies on you more than you think . Ah , he does a good job hiding it . There 's something about this case he 's not telling me ... Yeah , well . Good luck . See you later . Oh stupid thing ! It 's nonsense ! It 's ridiculous ! What 's wrong with you ? You alright . What 's up ? Do you know anything about engines ? Not modern ones . Only two stroke engine , anytime . Got a meeting in ten minutes . Come on , Rich . Hi , you are through to Rich , please leave a message . Dad . What about my things ? I don 't even have a phone charger . Well , no . I 'll , I 'll get you another , love . Don 't worry . But my clothes , and my stuff ... They 've got shops there . They 've got more shops than you believe . You 'll be able to buy whatever you want . But it 's Kerry 's party on Friday , and Adam 's going and I promised them I 'd be there and she 'll hate me and I 'll have no friends and I ... It 's alright , it 's alright . Dad . I don 't wanna go . It 's just for a little bit , love . Just to keep you out of harm 's way . Trust me , it 'll be okay . Listen to me . I had to put this back on . You know that , don 't you ? I don 't want to go , Dad . I know . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . We 'll be fine . We 'll be absolutely fine . Come on , darling , it is New York , you are going to love it . Suri . Harry . I think Isabella has abducted Rich . A witness saw a man of his description being pushed into the boot of the car , near my flat . He didn 't get a full view of the license plate , but it looks like Isabella 's . He was with me , moments before ... I can 't believe it . Okay . Okay . Have we heard anything yet ? Nothing from his work , his mobile 's dead , but we don 't know for sure ... I know . She 's got him . A PNC camera picked up her car in Mile End , but she went under a flyover and we haven 't been able to track her since . We 've alerted all branches , everything is flagged . It won 't do any good . Sure it will , we just have ... This isn 't like you . I 've met my match . Impossible . Tell me about her . Tell me properly . We were lovers . I knew it . You bloody idiot . She seemed so perfect at first . The only person that really knew me for what I was . Then it went too far , a bit crazy , and next thing I know she 's with Winter . She chose him because of me . To get back at me . And now Rich . It 's the same thing . It 's a message . A threat . My own brother . He really likes you , by the way . Me and my boyfriends . The curse of Suri strikes again . We will get her . I know we will . If anyone can , you can . This is Rich , we can 't give up . Steve , can you show us where her car was last seen ? Okay . She was heading East . Camera picked her up around here . And then , I don 't know , she disappeared . And then we 've got cameras on every road every junction . We 've got a helicopter up there , but by the time she hit the flyover ... The problem is there 's six possible routes out of here . Even with all our coverage , if she takes a smaller route , then ... she could be anywhere ... It doesn 't help that we 've got two cameras out on Bow Road , but even so , we should have something ... - So what do we do ? - I don 't know . We wait . Are you kidding me ? By the time a camera picks her up , she could in Essex , or Somerset , - or bloody Scotland . - Well , thank you . I 'm aware of that ! This is what we have ! She 's here . Fairfield Road ... Bring up the traffic feed on Fairfield Road . For any reason ? Just do it , Steve . Turn the camera round onto Wrexham Road ? Come on . Come on . - There . - What the hell ... Let 's go . I want S019 surrounding that car . And no one but no one approaches until I 'm there ! Don 't move , keep your hands where I can see them . Don 't shoot ! Where is she ? Don 't you need to start the tape , say your name , the time , all that ? Where is she ? I have a message for you . From your brother . It 's on my mobile phone . - Where 's his phone ? - Right there . Harry ? Is it on ? Harry , Jesus man , you need to get here quick . Seriously . He 's only gone and ... - What do you want ? - You heard the tape ? How did it make you feel ? What do you want ? She wants you to know that she still loves you . Whatever you do to me . Where is my brother ? You have to suffer , Harry Clayton . Lose everything . Have it stripped away . So you can see the world as she does . What do you mean ? Once you 're free , you 'll understand . It has to be . Your brother will die . Alright . Alright . No ... Where 's my brother ? Where 's my brother ? ! - Harry .. - I 'll kill him . I 'm not talking to you . We understand our colleague 's actions were unacceptable . I have delivered my message . I have nothing more to say . Where is Isabella Augustine ? You do realise you will be charged with aiding and abetting - several murders ? - You won 't catch her . Watch us . She 's beyond you . She 's beyond anyone . She 's a Goddess . Course she is ! You don 't understand . You haven 't seen her . Not like she sees you . She can see everything . She can see you now . I 'm sure . Sure , okay I think we 're done here . She 'll watch you while you 're sleeping . Interview terminated four fifty five ... It 's not an even fight . I have too many weaknesses . Daisy , Anna , Rich , you ... She has none . No one . It makes her too strong . I want to see her arrested , I want to , have her put in jail , to , to feel justice , to see good win . But she 's pure evil . What do I do ? You already know . - You have to kill her . - What ? And if I do that , if I take a life , the worst crime , Eve , the worst , everything I 've spent my life fighting against , then where will the bracelet take me ? Isabella is me in ten years ' time . She keeps telling me this , if I kill her , I prove her right . If I kill her , I lose . If you don 't , we all lose . You don 't think Harry 's actions are a little ... extreme ? It 's his brother . Yeah , I know . He attacked a suspect . The brief makes a formal complaint , then undoes all the good work . Are you suggesting we report him ? No ! I 'm suggesting , you have a word , calm him down , get him take a - back seat if necessary . - But it 's Rich ! Yeah . I understand Suri . I just trust Harry to find him . If you had to put your last penny on one person ... Who would it be ? Okay . Let 's just keep an eye though , yeah ? And you 're wrong , by the way . You could bet on me . Your last penny . I wouldn 't let you down . Harry ? Is it on ? Harry , Jesus , Harry ? Is it on ? Harry , Jesus man , you need to get here quick . Seriously . Harry ? Is it on ? Harry , Jesus man , you need to get here quick . Seriously . He 's only gone and Harry , Jesus man , you need to get here quick . Seriously . Jesus man , you need to get And get me a timetable of today 's tides , and of the river ferries , all boat routes , any routes you can . Now . Come on . Okay , listen . Come here . Come here . Harry ? Is it on ? Harry , Jesus man , you have to get here quick . Seriously . He 's only gone and ... Harry , Jesus man ... There , that 's a tannoy . That 's a tannoy for a river ferry . So he 's outside . Somewhere near the Thames . And now listen to this ... Harry ? Those bells , that chime ... I know those bells ... I used to work for Burmasy beat , when I first came across the water . So , it 's a church near a river . It 's there , All Saints . So , depending on which way the wind was blowing ... Where 's the met office information I asked for ? Depending on which way the wind is blowing , those bells were pealed between here and here . A two mile radius . But the ferries don 't stop at every pier ... They stop here ... here ... and here , - there are tannoy announcements on every ferry ... so ... - Boss . The tide 's rising . The tide 's rising . - Harry . - No . No . You two stay here . I need you here . Come on , Rich , where are you ? Okay , can you link to the river and find out exactly where Harry is ? Can you get me a ... a link to him as well ? Steve ! Suri ? Are you okay ? What if Rui isn 't mad ? What if Isabella can see us ? Right now , like he said ? Harry Clayton left the office twenty minutes ago . He 's heading towards the river . I could put some red lights up to slow him down , if you 'd like . No . Let him go . Good luck to him . What about the other two . Orwell and Chohan ? They left shortly afterwards . But I don 't think they 're with him . He 's right . Gotcha . Police ! Move ! Out of the way ! Come on , clear off ! Rich ? ! Rich ? ! Rich ? ! Rich ? ! Rich ? ! Rich ? ! - Argh ! - Alright ? It 's alright . It 's alright . Come on Rich . Help me . Help me , come on . That 's it . That 's it . That 's it . That 's it . Would you mind ? Oh well , I hope that wasn 't my masseur . He gets hopelessly booked up . She 's been processed . We should call Harry , let him know we 've got her . I want to speak to her first . Why did you kill DSI Alistair Winter ? Shouldn 't this be taking place in an interview room , with a lawyer ? Maybe ! You killed a cop . Things get done differently because of that . Why did you kill Alistair ? You are in a cell , in a police station . There are at least twenty people outside willing to beat the shit out of you ! You will go down for this . I will make sure that you pay . My darling , if I am punished , the only one who will see it is Harry Clayton . Harry thought that he was the only one that could catch you . What 's the deal with the bracelets ? How do you think Harry gets all these breaks , on his cases ? You know the near death escapes , the extraordinary coincidences , they all seem to work in his favour . I know you might not buy into this but these are lucky bracelets . Very powerful . Should be good to get away . Get some fresh air , some Auntie Niamh 's cooking . I 'm sorry , Rich . That was some luck , finding me like that . You saved my life . Just shows you . Shows me what ? You 're always saying she 's too strong . I don 't think so . So . Is that forever ? Bet it 's not . No chance . Can 't be . Look , erm ... Make me proud . My toilet , if that 's what you call it , is all blocked up . Can I use another one ? Don 't even think about trying to close the door . I want my solicitor . How 's your nose ? We 've got Isabella . Your boss isn 't quite so magical after all , is she ? And Harry Clayton ? Oh , he found his brother . So that plan didn 't work either . Harry 's not here , is he ? Why does that matter ? And where is the girl , DS Chohan ? She is here , yes ? Alright , enough ! What are you talking about ? Why do you care if Suri 's here , and Harry isn 't ? Don 't you see ? He has to lose everything . Suri . Harry . We 've got her . What ? No , you can 't have ... Where is she ? Don 't worry , she 's in the cells . The only reason you 've got her is because she let you . - What do you mean ? - She 's too powerful for you . That 's what she said . Harry , has this got something to do with the bracelet ? Suri . Get out of there . Now ! This is all sounding a bit crazy ! Yeah . I know . I know . I 'll explain later , just listen to me . Get out of there , now ! Everybody out ! The ambulances are here ! Here , give me ! Give me ! Suri ? Hello , Suri ? Suri ? Harry ? - Steve ? Steve ? - I can 't find her , Harry . She 's here . She 's got to be here . She called me from here . Suri ? Suri ? Andy ? Andy ? Polly ? Oh God , SURI ! HARRY ! Suri ! Someone , help please ! - Well ? - Harry , come on let 's go . Harry ! Hey ! Come on ! Listen , she 's been calling for you , Harry . Harry ! Get her ! You can do this ... I 'm waiting ... I knew you 'd come . Of course I came . I was trying to run away from all of this , I just boarded a flight and then a strange mechanical fault grounded the plane . And I ended up in that hotel . This is all for us ! The bracelets wanted us to be together , Harry . You should be dead ! But you 're not . It 's our fate . I don 't believe in fate . This is for Alistair ... For the brother I 've abandoned , the wife I 've lost . Can you really do this ? The daughter I 'll never see again . Not this time . Your luck is running out . There 's nowhere to run , Isabella ! The bracelet won 't allow it . Shall we see ? You 'd have to wish me dead . That isn 't you . You don 't think like that . You 're too good . I wish I 'd met you before . Seen you with your daughters . Don 't ... You were a good person , a good mother . I was . And then the bracelet got hold of you . I ... It wasn 't just the bracelet , it , it was me too ... God ! I was blinded by its power , it seduced me , it made me greedy , and so then ... my girls , they died because of me ... But you 're strong . Though it will happen to you in time . It 's the inevitable corrosive power of the bracelet . Harry . If you pull that trigger ... I have to . There 's no other way . Maybe there is . This is my final gift to you . I love you .

 ORBIT 9 Oxygen level at one percent . The capsule will arrive in 17 hours . I know . You 'll breathe better soon . You 're going to meet the first human being in your lifetime . The third . Don 't be angry , Helena . It depends how you count . I 'm not angry . Your mother and I have discussed it a thousand times . We 've repeated the calculations over and over again . It 's the best solution . The three of us on the ship would have oxygen for a little over a year . But if you travel alone , the levels would last four or five times longer . Helena , I wish I could have hugged and kissed you one last time , but I know you . And I know you wouldn 't have let us do it . Please , be strong . Hang on until the engineer arrives . I know you 'll make it . We love you very much . Time to get up , Helena . Day 7,409 of your voyage . Reserve oxygen activated . Weekly medical check-up waiting . Cardiac cycle correct . The ankle fissure has almost closed . Don 't push it the next few days . Coupling initiated . Maneuver completed . Opening outer lock . Robotics engineer 11 beta 57 . Helena . Nice to meet you , Helena . I only have 50 hours of autonomy . It 's that way , right ? We never found out why the oxygen matrix got misconfigured . It was sudden , not even the Rebecca unit found an explanation . Right . It 's rare but it happens sometimes . Even in bigger ships than this one . Can you fix it ? Yes . I 'm the only one left . Three years ago ... my parents left so that I could survive . I 'm sorry . What 's it called ? It 's called Kubic . It 's a defective connection tracker . It 'll help me work faster . Let me know if you need anything . Thanks . What 's your name ? Alex . Shall we have dinner together , Alex ? No , I can 't . I have too much work . It 's just that ... I 've never had a guest . Or eaten with anyone besides my parents . You have to have dinner , right ? In half an hour ? They did the navigation calculation and realized that traveling alone was the only way to make it here . Where someone could come and help me . Actually you were lucky , Helena . Yes , if the failure had occurred at any other point in the journey , nobody would have heard our distress call . That 's right . You 've really never been curious to see Celeste ? I don 't have the strength you colonists have . I 've never seen anything else . I came on the ship as a baby and if everything works out I 'll be over 40 years old when I get out . Sometimes I think it makes no sense . Spending half your life cooped up trying to get somewhere . But then I remember that my parents were colonists . And that I am too . And that I have to reach Celeste , even if it 's only for the sacrifice they made for me . Time to get up , Helena . Day 7,410 of your voyage . Oxygen reserve deactivated . Hi . I can breathe better . I 'm almost finished . It 'll be ready tomorrow . I don 't understand a word you say . Hi , Helena . I wanted to say I can 't have dinner tonight . Why not ? I have 2 or 3 more hours with Rebecca and I need to rest . Of course . Good night . Good night . Cardiac cycle correct . Pulse slightly high . Arterial pressure normal . What are you doing ? Looking at you . Why ? I 've never kissed anyone . Helena ... I 'm going to spend the next 20 years in here . By myself . But if you want me to leave , I will . You 're leaving without saying goodbye ? I didn 't want to wake you . I 'm sorry about what happened last night . I 'm not . Opening outer lock . AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY ORBIT PROGRAM HEADQUARTERS Base code in hangars 1 , 4 , 7 , 11 , 12 . The turbine matrix reached 100 in the scale model . You know what that means , right ? That with a little luck we 'll see the first ships take off in 20 or 30 years . With a little luck and some care we 'll probably still be alive and see it with our own eyes . I thought you 'd be more excited . I am excited , Hugo . You don 't look it . What 's wrong ? I don 't now . What ? We 've never wondered about the passengers in the simulators ... All the time . That 's why we have the data from their biowitnesses . But those are numbers . Yes , numbers . The most precise language that exists . - But we 're talking about something else . - What ? We 're talking about people . We 've always talked about people . But not about ten people . We 're talking about 8 billion people . Alex , I 've dedicated half of my life to this project . And although you 've only been with us for 5 years , I know this is just as important to you as it is to me . Pick up the Orbit 10 dossier , go home and get some rest . You have only one simulator left . When you 've closed that last door , you 'll see everything differently . Clean ! The Ministry of the Environment announces that next week it will create more artificial storms in all the northern districts of the city . They will be nocturnal rains that will occur every Wednesday next month . Temperatures tomorrow ... Why don 't you take this to Monica ? I don 't think she 'll like it . Come by the 99 one of these nights . We miss you , man . The test results came in yesterday . Come by the clinic anytime to pick them up . Why don 't you save me the trip ? Your bones are fine , the analytics too . You have radiation in your body but within normal parameters . You shouldn 't have entered the simulators , but you 're a lucky bastard . Why don 't you come over for dinner tonight ? - Monica will be happy to see you . - I can 't tonight , Chao . Don 't worry , I promise I won 't turn on the TV . Today is the 5th anniversary of the first civilian flight with a completely android crew , a catastrophe that left 207 people dead and a shadow of doubt over new industry trends . We tried to contact Alex Rojas , the Spaniard who created the since-decommissioned Icarus 3000 pilots , but we were unable to locate him . Tonight we have several experts who will analyze what might be the keys to making the new generation of android crews 100 % reliable . We 'll speak to them after this commercial . I don 't understand a word you say . You know what ? I should be happy because Alex fixed the problem , but ... I don 't know why , but I 'm not . I wish it would have taken him longer . The first ships to Celeste could take off in 15 years , but the boarding protocol remains confusing and must be validated by participating nations . Depending on the reproductive capacity of the individual ... Good morning . Good morning . - Hi . - Hi . Silvia will be a while , she still has a couple of customers . I 'll wait for her . You 've lost weight . Is that a compliment ? It 's a warning . Silvia , how many sessions have we had ? 197 including today . That many ? Well , that 's what this screen says . Then it 's time to be straight with each other . I thought we were from the beginning , Alex . That 's what this therapy is about . There are passengers inside the simulators . I already know that . No , you don 't . I 'm not talking about the scientist couples we all know . They put babies inside . Babies that are adults now . They 've been in there their whole lives . They think they 're going to Celeste . I don 't follow you . Human guinea pigs . Did you know all along ? Yes . Coupling initiated . What 's going on ? What is this ? Is there an assembly request ? Origin unknown , Helena . Opening outer lock . Maneuver completed . I know this is going to sound crazy to you , but we 're not where you think . This isn 't a ship , Helena . It 's a simulator . On the other side of that door ... is Earth . We have to get out of here right now , Helena . Leave . Go back to your pod . It 's been recording since you were a baby . There are two more in this corridor and another in the decompression chamber . I disconnected them . We have to go . I told you to leave . It 's a biowitness . They planted it inside you when you were born . They check your vital signs . Let me take it out . It won 't hurt . Helena . Helena ... Helena ! I want you to see something . We 're going to send your vital signs in a remote code . Cardiac cycle correct . Pulse normal . Arterial pressure stable . Rebecca ? Rebecca is a navigation robot . She doesn 't communicate with the outside . Are you ready ? Opening outer lock . Let 's go . Come on , Helena . Don 't be afraid . Come on . Helena , give me your hand . Good , Helena . You 're doing great . This way . That 's it . We 're almost there . I need you to ride inside here , okay ? Simulation center , grid clean . Affirmative , check the next one . The levels are higher than normal . It 's the suit . You left it outside . Gate ! The same thing happened with the other ships . It was all agreed . Since when ? Since before you were born . And you coming to the ship ? That too . The oxygen was only an excuse . - It 's checked in remote code . - Then why did you go in ? Technical inspection of each Rebecca unit . I want to see them . Nobody can know you 're out . But they 're my parents . Nobody , Helena . Especially them . Why ? Because they 're military scientists . They 've dedicated half their lives to this project . - But they 're my family . - No , they 're not . They 're not . - What is that ? - Thunder . It 's going to rain . Come on . I HAVE A MEETING BACK IN 2 HOURS WE LIVE HERE , BUT DON 'T GO OUT WITHOUT ME ! IF SOMEONE RINGS DON 'T OPEN DOOR DOWNSTAIRS SHOWER DOESN 'T WORK REMEMBER , I 'LL BE BACK IN 2 HOURS PLEASE DON 'T MOVE THE PIECES What if they find out ? There 's no reason they would . That 's not an answer , Alex . What if something goes wrong ? It 's too dangerous . I 'm willing to take that risk . Right . That 's what worries me . Alex . Don 't look at me like that . Did you really think I was a wolf ? No , but we 're not supposed to see each other . My cell phone . I have an apartment I never use in Isaura District . If for any reason you need to disappear for a while , you only have to call me . And please don 't talk about this subject in the booth again . Sometimes they record the conversations randomly . Thank you , Silvia . Really . Go on , get lost . Hi . It 's weird , I 've always had the same clothes but in every size . So , where do you want to go ? What do you want to do ? I don 't know . What 's your favorite place ? Sometimes the simplest mechanisms are actually the most complex . I could spend my whole life looking at them . They 're weird , but pretty . Is the sea far away ? The sea isn 't like you imagine it anymore . The acid tides destroyed everything . If nobody fixes it , soon they 'll only be able to live in places like this . Did you ever go in the water ? Yeah , when I was six or seven . But I didn 't like it . I can 't imagine you at six or seven years old . I was practically like I am now . Shy ... Look . I was antisocial , Coke-bottle glasses ... A freak . A freak ? What 's a freak ? A freak is ... different . Then I 'm a freak too . You have to hold the chopstick with this finger . Why do you use chopsticks ? You have to use this finger . - Why do you eat with sticks ? - Open your mouth . Good morning . What 's in the room downstairs ? The one I can 't go in . There are no cameras in the bedroom or the common areas . Only the ones you saw in the corridor and the entrance . I only had to hack the first one . And when they see I 'm not getting older ... or that I always do the same thing ? We 'll record your signal from here and send it whenever we want . It 's easy . What will they do with the rest of the passengers in 20 years at the end of the voyage ? The Rebecca unit will inform them of a supposed error in the navigation chart and it will be extended indefinitely . What for ? To study their vital signs longer . How much longer ? The simulators will only open the doors when the biowitnesses confirm that each passenger is deceased . How ... How could you get involved in something like this ? I 'd like to show you something . Hugo came into my life shortly thereafter . When he explained the experiment to me , I guess I only wanted to see the positive side of the project . With the Earth-Celeste voyage simulation we can save millions of lives across the world ... when the trips become a reality . That 's all I took into account . So ... you put it all on a scale and didn 't mind sacrificing ten people ? No . I didn 't at the time . - I love it when you 're upset . - Oh , Marta . It 's true . That 's the reason I married her . - I 'm being serious . - So am I. 12 hours with no water every day . And we 're the lucky ones , in other sectors it 's worse . So you two met in Spain when you were kids ? That 's right . I had no idea Alex worked here . When I ran into him at the lab , I couldn 't believe it . Of course . What a surprise ! Helena 's a brilliant computer technician . No wonder they went over there to find her . And you 're like Alex , right ? You can 't talk about the Orbit program . Confidential information . What do you think , Chao ? Alex said you 're not convinced about the trip to Celeste . Well , I think at some point we 'll have to make a decision . Either go back to being the cavemen we once were , or travel to Celeste . But you still think things can be fixed here . I wish we weren 't throwing in the towel on Earth . I also don 't like the idea of my son having to spend half his lifetime in a ship to reach a planet we don 't even know . I don 't even consider it . Marta and I would get immediately rejected by the boarding protocol . The reproduction criteria is crap . There you go . We 're a disgusting species and we deserve the planet we 've got . But our kids don 't . Everything went fine . The ten simulators are in order . The inspection phase was a success . I 'll take care of it . See you after the committee . Alex ! Can you come for a second ? - Does it hurt ? - No . It wasn 't the sun this time . I 'm going to call Chao . Don 't worry about the prick , you won 't even feel it . Laura will take care of you , she has hands of gold . Laura , please treat her like family . We 'll see you in the office . Good . Alex , over here . Then it 's serious ? No , I don 't think it 's serious . We have to wait for the results . I just find it striking how delicate and white her epidermis is , like she 's never been in the sun . You know , computer geeks are like vampires . Is that it ? Alex , where did you get her ? GENETIC ENGINEERS ORBIT 04 SUBJECT STUDY ORBIT 04 CONFIDENTIAL GENERALITIES CLONE 04 25 years ago you gave us access to the cloning bank , a brave gesture which clearly sets us apart from the other four cities where the Orbit program is currently being developed . GENERALITIES CLONE ( ) 9 The biowitnesses offer us real data about the voyage 's impact on not only the physical but also mental health of our future passengers . CURRENT RESIDENCE This allows us not only to stay ahead , but also to prepare ourselves . It 's not a question of race or borders . It 's not even a political issue . The fact is , we 're a species peering over the edge of its existence . We 've obviously been unable to protect and take care of the Earth 's limited resources . Nevertheless , one morning planet GJ909 appeared in half the world 's telescopes . At first we thought it was unheard of , but over time it has become our only , hear me well , only ... chance of survival . As you can see , its existence gives us the chance to dream of a better future . And I 'm not talking about us , but our children and our grandchildren . I 'm talking about the chance we have to start over as a species . The cloning bank only works with samples from people who died at least two generations back . Helena , you 're unique . Like everyone else . No , not like everyone else . Helena , you 're genetically-exact copies of very healthy people . You 're actually better than most people . What good did that do me ? I 'll get some coffee . It was the engineer , wasn 't it ? How could you leave me like that ? Come on , pick it up . Where 's the coffee ? What are you doing ? Dad ... ? She has to go back to the simulator . I 'm going to call security , they 'll be here in five minutes . No , wait . - Then we have to talk to Hugo . - No , wait . Please , wait . Please ! Helena ? Helena ! Go to the main road . Get in the first taxi you find . Dad will call the program and I won 't be able to stop him . Do you think like he does ? Hurry . I 'm on my way . Are you okay ? Why didn 't you tell me ? You went to see your parents . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - We have to go , Helena . - We have to go . - Alex ! You 're all I have . You lied to me . I 'm sorry . Well , that 's why I need help . Does Katherine know ? Of course she does . Katherine gave the order ! Okay , we 'll see you tomorrow . All right . - Thanks , Silvia . - Be careful . What did she say ? She 'll give us the key when she leaves her job . It 's worse , isn 't it ? A little , yes . It 's very important that you catch them . Hopefully alive , especially her . Are you okay ? What if we 're wrong ? What about the other nine passengers ? Why should I be different from them ? Now I understand this whole mess . You 're beautiful . Thanks . When my parents lived in the Isaura District it was poor , but normal , not the mess it is now . If you don 't bother anyone , no one will bother you . I don 't know how to thank you , Silvia . Really . Probably a colleague who forgot something . Stay here . Nobody can see you here . What are you doing ? Lower your voice , ma 'am . We closed over an hour ago . Shut up . Do you know him ? No idea . The membership log says he comes here often . Well , it 's the first time I 've seen him . What are you doing here at this hour ? I 'm doing a software check . They 're selected randomly , today it 's my turn . I was leaving in five minutes . Could you show us your booth , please ? Of course . Who is that ? It 's Hugo . Why isn 't it connected ? I was closing in five minutes , I told you . Could you turn it on , please ? Don 't move , don 't even blink . Sure . They 're default projections . They don 't move ? No . Never ? Never . And like this ? - Like what ? - Like this . It moved . - That one ? - Yes . Are you sure ? It can 't move , it 's impossible . Why not , ma 'am ? Because the sensors are off . It 's not impossible , I saw it . It 's your fucking imagination ! They can 't move ! Take it easy . Tell them to come out . Ma 'am , tell them to come out . Son of a bitch ! Son of a bitch ! You see ? I saw them in there ! Alex , let 's go ! Come on , we have to jump . Let 's go ! You go first . I need to see how you do it . Please , go first . Come on ! Come on ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Take her to the van . We don 't need him . Alex , what the hell is going on ? They almost destroyed my clinic . I 'm sorry . I told them I hadn 't seen you , that I didn 't know her . - Why didn 't you answer my calls ? - It 's too dangerous . The phone could be tapped . Don 't call me again . - Did you read my message ? - Yeah . That 's why I 'm here . Okay . I did a biopsy of Helena 's skin sample and the results aren 't good . She has a very strange mutation in her epidermis . She 's like a butterfly that can 't live outside , in this cesspool . They took her . She 's not with me now . Better for her . The only place she can live right now is in there . Her skin got used to the pressurized environment inside the ship . You don 't understand . The analytics chain is broken . I have to get her out of there . There 's something else . Let me go back inside . You can 't . Why not ? Because you can 't . Why not ? Because we disconnected Orbit 9 . Then connect it . That 's not how things work , Helena . I 'll try to be clear . You 're of no use to us anymore . Leave Alex alone . Please . I can 't leave her outside the simulator . And now I can 't put her back in the simulator . Alex . I 'll offer you a deal . A deal . You 're offering me a deal ? Yes , but first I want to see Helena . Stop fucking with me , damn it ! You 're a scientist and you fell in love with the mouse . Do you hear how ridiculous that sounds ? Hugo , if anyone has something to gain here , it 's you . Will she suffer ? She 'll get sleepy . It 's quick , one or two minutes after we inject her . She won 't even know what 's happening . Stop , you bastard ! Code 3 at main entrance . I just talked to Hugo ! Beige vehicle has stopped . I said stop ! He 's expecting me ! He 's expecting me ! Stop ! No ! Lower your weapons . He 's an engineer . Everyone stop ! Alex , you 're in worse shape than I thought . I 'm offering you what you 've wanted your whole life . But you could be lying too . And you could shoot me . And I will . Like you did Silvia . But if I 'm telling the truth , you 'll keep your word . I want to be inside that ship with Helena . POSITIVE - 6 WEEKS SEX - FEMALE But the board isn 't here now . The only ones here are Katherine and Hugo . Speak . I have one condition .

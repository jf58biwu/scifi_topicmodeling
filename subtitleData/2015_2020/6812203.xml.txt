 You 're really good at this time , Barry . - Seriously ? - Yeah , yeah . Yeah , seriously ! - You come to Star City , you ask for my help , - OK . and then , inevitably , immediately , we end up up the creek ! Yeah , okay . That 's fair . Thank you . They 're moving in . On three , Team Leader . What 's that ? That would be heat vision . - Three . - Okay . Part2 Kid gets faster every time we test him . - Mach 2 . - Already ? He just got his speed a few days ago . How are his vitals ? His running economy , lactate threshold are all way above expected levels . I think we might have a little prodigy on our hands . Like a Wizard of Whiz . Guys , I don 't want Wally thinking that he 's Barry , rushing off half-cocked , trying to take down Alchemy or Savitar the next time one of them shows up . Okay , but guys , Wally 's not like me . He doesn 't want his powers gone . We 're gonna have a hard time convincing him not to use them . Yeah , well , we have to . Until he 's ready . How ? By convincing him that he isn 't . That means no encouraging him , no training him , and you ... no talking to him about a suit , please . It 's for his own good . Why the hell not ? It 's just another lie between friends , right ? Cisco . What ? Still not good ? I think maybe we should try again tomorrow . I can run a few more tests . That was amazing . Dinner 's on me . Whatever you want . Test . Test . Fellow S.T.A.R. Labs employees . Your presence in the cortex would be greatly appreciated . That 's tonight ? His presentation ? Great . What do you think if , after , maybe we get a drink ? You , me , Barry ? Barry ? We 're just gonna get drinks ? Pretend like we 're friends ? Nice try . It ain 't gonna happen . You want to open S.T.A.R. Labs to the public ? In two weeks ? Soft open . Not a hard open . But , you know , I 'll use your input . All right ? Right now , it 's very important 'cause the clock is ticking . My vision is set to include , but not limited to- - bam- - a personal transportation tour of the facility . Or , for the faint of heart , we have- - pow- - a virtual reality alternative . Both set to include particle vision . Particle ... vision ? Particle vision , which is a moment-to-moment reenactment of the particle accelerator explosion , but seen from the point of view of ... - Part- - - The particle ! Listen , H.R. , I know that you 're trying to figure out how you add value to the team , I get it , but this- - Let me stop you right there , B.A. - Okay , don 't call me B.A.- - - I can make S.T.A.R. Labs the powerhouse in the scientific community that it once was , and , moreover , earn back the people 's trust . Look at you guys . You just- - your faces are so darn gloomy . Here 's what we 'll do . I 'm gonna make you guys a- - Was that- - was that the satellite ? I hope that wasn 't the satellite . Is that a meteor ? Why , yes , that is a meteor , and yes , it is heading for downtown . I got to go . Guys . What is it ? Barry , what do you see ? This isn 't a meteor . Barry ? Hey , Barry , come in . - Can you hear me ? - Guys ? Oh , come on . Aliens ! Government officials are reporting the mysterious object that crashed in downtown Central City was simply a DOD aircraft on a routine training operation . Thank you , but we 'll brief the White House . You 're not listening to me about this . The intelligence we 've gathered at A.R.G.U.S.- - Is not accurate . We 've got this covered , Director Michaels . Go back to Star City . Let the big guns take over . Lyla , what is this ? I saw the weird ship that crashed- - You saw a ship ? What else did you see ? Enough to give Ridley Scott nightmares . Meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs . I 'll tell you everything I know . Aliens ? Are they " Alien " Aliens or little green men ? Both , sort of . Since we learned of them , we 've been calling them the Dominators . That is not the name of a species that comes in peace . No , no , it 's very aggressive . So how long have you known about these Dominators ? Since the ' 50s . That was them . Redmond , Oregon . The government tried to cover it up . What ? I watch Syfy channel . In 1951 , they appeared under the same sort of circumstances . A ship crash-landed . Little to no communication . We learned they were abducting humans to gather intel about us . They attacked , and hundreds of soldiers lost their lives . Then , for some inexplicable reason , they left . All contact had been lost until three months ago when the DOD received this . We pose no threat , human inhabitants . Understanding is our purpose . Any action against us , as shown to us in the past , will prompt swift retaliation . So when we discovered four ships heading towards Earth , we were concerned that it was happening all over again . One of them , obviously , landed here . Right , ' cause we ain 't got enough crazy going on here in Central City . Do you know what they want ? They 've ignored all attempts to communicate , but we do know , just like before , that the dropships contain reconnaissance teams sent here to gather more intel about us . Looking for our weaknesses . - We need to do something . - We are . Nearly every member state in the UN is in talks to coordinate a response . Action is being taken . So , wait , you want us to just sit this one out ? These things are like " World War Z " Zombies . If they decide to attack , no military can stop them . Neither could you . Not by yourself , anyway . Just let us handle this . For now . I will be in touch . So the plan isn 't to just stay still and do nothing , right ? No . Barry , you heard Lyla . You can 't do this alone . I don 't plan to . Anything ? Zilch . He 's got to be here somewhere . What are the chances the guy just decided that he had enough of this life , you know ? No health insurance . He was sick of the crazy hours . I mean , bullets aren 't actually that cheap , and he- - - I 'm sorry , man . I- - - It 's okay . Man ... Hi , Barry . So , who was that guy ? That was Vigilante , and we nearly had him . You nearly had him , Ollie ? It looked like he was about to " Scarface " you guys . Barry , is there something that I can do for you ? Another evil speedster to help you with or- - Maybe , actually . That 's not why I 'm here , though . What 's so urgent that you had to rush to Star City ? Aliens . Aliens ? Aliens . I swear to God , Barry . My life was somewhat normal before I met you . I- - I mean , I 'm sorry . Look , okay , they 're real , and they 're already here , and , from what Lyla told us , it does not appear to be for peace . - Oh , no . - Lyla knows about this ? Lyla- - yeah , she came to- - where are you- - I called Thea . Yeah , I came to have you sign this before City Council went in to mutiny , but that can totally wait . Count me in . For what ? I thought you retired . Yeah , but it 's- - it 's aliens . Aw , that is so cute . You guys are just gonna get together and go fight some aliens- - have you lost your mind ? They 're aliens , and there 's only four of you . Not if we get Stein and , you know , all the others . They 're calling themselves the Legends . Egotistical but catchy . Do you know where they are ? I know where they were . What is this place ? It 's this old hall hangar thing that S.T.A.R. Labs owns . Or I guess I own it . Well , you should do something with it . All right , so let me get this right . Our time-traveling buddies in a flying timeship are supposed to just pop up right here , right ? Yeah . This is the time and place I gave them , so if they got my message , they should be here- - Right now . You know why I 've never done drugs ? It 's ' cause I was always afraid I 'd see weird stuff . Okay , take everybody inside , all right ? - Tell Oliver I 'll be right back . - Where are you going ? Well , since we 're fighting aliens , I figured we should get one of our own , right ? You found the right Earth ? Tachyon device tracked you on Earth-38 when you met her , - so you should find her there . - All right . Just so you know , I 'm only doing this because we 're on a mission . I 'm not gonna let my issues with you get in the way of that . This might take a few tries . This better be the right place . 'Cause if this isn 't the right place , someone 's about to be real confused . Barry ? I knew it ! I knew that was you . I knew it was you in that weird space- - Sorry , it took a couple tries to get here . This is my friend , Cisco . Well , friend is a loose term . We work together . Hi . Cisco . I have to say it- - this is a nice universe you got here . Thank you . Okay , do you remember last year when I helped you out and you promised to do the same for me ? What are we up against ? Team Arrow is here . Team Legends is here . - Is that everyone ? - I think so ? Nate and Amaya are back watching the Waverider . The newbies . That was cool . Guys Thanks for coming . Barry , I thought you were bringing an alien . And , yeah , we did . Everybody , this is my friend , Kara Danvers , or , as she 's known on her Earth , Supergirl . What makes her so super ? Well ? I 'm convinced . Best . Team-up . Ever ! Okay . I think I have this . - Oliver . - Green Arrow . - Dig . - Spartan . - Thea . - Speedy . Okay . - And Sara . - White Canary . - Jax and Professor Stein . - Firestorm . - Ray . - Palmer . The Atom . And Mick . Heat Wave . And ... Iris , Caitlin , and Felicity . Yes ! And you , you have cold powers , but you can 't use them ? - You have powers ? - It 's a long story . Barry , so , Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow ? - Yeah . - Oh , my God . He just got so much hotter . Okay , Cisco , we should probably get started . These are the Dominators . We don 't know much about them . Except they 're really strong . I-I heard a lot of stories about them when I was a kid . They came to my planet before I was born . They did experiments on a lot of people . Killed a lot more . Well , they 're not the only ones with superhuman strength , I hear . Barry says that you 're more powerful than a locomotive . We should use Kara as a stand-in for training . Since when is Robin Hood calling the shots ? What I think Mick is trying to say is it would be nice if we knew who was in charge around here . Maybe we should take a vote . Choose a leader . Someone we can all trust . Well , I trust Oliver . He 's got my vote . Appreciate that , Cisco , but Barry put us all together . It should be him . Fair enough . Okay . Cool , all right , well , I guess as Team Leader , first thing to do is start out by ... - Doing a test run . - Let 's do a test run . Yeah , let 's do a test run . - Against Supergirl . - Against Supergirl , all right ? Test run against Supergirl . Are we just supposed to pretend like we don 't hear him ? So just suit up . Mm-kay ? Look alive . We 're training to fight aliens by fighting an alien , so ... - Do it . - Suit up . - Stop . - What ? Oliver . Hey . Kara . Really quick . I was excited about the two of you guys meeting each other . Oliver was the first person to train me . - Really ? - Yeah . Well , you did a really good job . It 's ' cause I didn 't hold back . I shot him . You can 't hold back either . - He did shoot me . - Ouch . Okay . Are you sure about that ? I just met these people- - These people need to understand this isn 't gonna be easy . Don 't hold back . Especially against me . Yes , sir . Does he not like me ? He 's like that with everyone . He 'll warm up to you . Old West Dwarf Star plus Replicator , equals new suit . You know what , Ray ? Maybe it 's just me , but I think this thing 's due for an update . Yes . But after we dominate the Dominators . I see what you did there . Listen . I got to get to work . Felicity 's waiting for me . But we 'll talk about this later . Hey , Barry . Where 's Snart ? Man , I 'm sorry , Barry . I forgot that we never told you . What happened ? He sacrificed himself . Saved us all . - He died a hero . - A Legend . Wally , what are you doing here ? You can 't just show up and think you 're gonna train with everyone else . Why not ? Because we need to test you more . HR Said that my results were great . He said I 'm good to go . I don 't care what HR Said . You are not ready . - I am ready . - Wally . Everyone here has been doing this for a long time , and this is gonna be the hardest challenge they have faced . Fighting Alchemy or Savitar or aliens isn 't something you just show up and try . If you screw up , you could die . Do you- - do you get that ? Great . Satellite 's not picking up anything abnormal . No . I don 't know if we 're gonna find any Dominators this way . I--just , I couldn 't help but notice things are a little bit tense . You don 't need to be able to Vibe to figure that out . Okay , so apparently , it 's , like , illegal to be mad at Barry , but guess what . He screws up , just like the rest of us . Yeah , and when he does , he feels bad like the rest of us too . Felicity , he took it upon himself to change the timeline . And because of it , my brother was killed . So there 's no amount of feeling bad that could ever make up for that . Barry . Before we start training , there 's something you need to hear . A message that would be better if we could share with you in private . - All right , I 'll step away . - No , no , it 's fine . You can stay . All right , but no one else . All right . Let 's make it quick . A war is coming , Captain Hunter , and at some point you 're gonna be called back to Central City to fight it . So you need to know that , while you and your team have been in the Temporal Zone , I made a choice that affected the timeline . As you know , whenever you alter the past , those changes affect the present and get compounded in the future . When you return , you will be in the new timeline I created , where everyone 's past and everyone 's future has been affected , including yours . When you come back , don 't trust anything or anyone . Not even me . Where did you get that from ? We found it in a secret room inside the Waverider . It was sent by you , 40 years from now . 40 years from now ? Barry , what the hell does this mean ? It means I screwed things up when I changed the past . What did you do ? I went back in time , and I saved my mom . I created a timeline where she 's alive . It 's called Flashpoint . I lived in it for a few months , until I realized that I made a big mistake , and I tried to reset the timeline , put things back to how they were supposed to be , but- - But it didn 't work . No . Barry , that 's ... So what 's changed since you did this ? Cisco 's brother is dead . Caitlin has powers . Diggle has a son now instead of a daughter . What ? John had a daughter ? I didn 't just screw up my life , man . I screwed up everybody 's lives and , apparently , everybody 's lives in the future . It felt like , when these aliens got here , that finally something had happened I didn 't cause , and maybe I could make up for everything I 'd done to everybody , but I- - I think we should be on the up and up with everybody . We got to tell ' em . We 're going up against a bunch of aliens , and you want to tell people that their lives might have been affected by time travel ? One sci-fi problem at a time . You made a mistake , Barry . It 's part of the job . But we can 't deal with it today . Professor Stein , are you okay ? I 'm not sure . Ms. Snow , would you mind accompanying me to my home ? There 's something I need to do . Sure . She really is a badass . Yeah , it 's kind of hot . Let 's go again . So this is , what , your way of advising me to do nothing ? The Dominators have yet to engage in an act of aggression , sir . What does A.R.G.U.S. think ? I think us being passive is exactly what they want , Mr. President . Well , finally , someone here with balls . Ike ignored all the signs and waited until it was too late . I 'm not gonna make that same mistake . You saw what happened the last time we engaged them . That 's a lot of casualties to be remembered for . Four dropships landed on this planet , all of them sent to gather intel . If we do nothing and they attack , that 's what I 'll be remembered for . Proceed as instructed . You know , Director Michaels , the reason that Amanda Waller lasted as long as she did is because she learned how to follow my lead . I suggest that you acquire that trait . Soon . He 's gone . Traveller has been taken . I repeat , Traveller has been taken . The Dominators have the President . - Hey , son . - I don 't understand , Dad . No one in this family wants me to have powers . You don 't . Barry doesn 't . Even Iris . According to this , everything 's fine with me . In fact , everything is better than fine . What , did you run back to make sure I didn 't see these ? I 'm faster than you now , remember ? Whether you or Barry or anyone likes it or not . Wally , look . I know you 're upset with me . I was just trying to protect you . Come on . I know you don 't want me training . I just don 't get why . Because I 'm better than Barry was when he first got his speed . You know , in Flashpoint , you and I were a brother-sister crime-fighting unit . So it sucks you don 't have the same faith in me here as you did there . Brother and sister crime-fighting unit ? Hi , there , Wallace . I came back to get some lip balm . It 's okay . You seem to be the only one that 'll tell me the truth around here . Me ? We 're kind of treated the same way , right ? No one shows us any respect . Respect , I 'm just trying to earn that , Wallace . Maybe we should stop listening to them . Yeah , what ? What does that mean ? It means I want you to train me . - Me ? - Mm-hmm . I would be gone faster than humor in a Liam Neeson movie . Do you know what I mean ? - No . - Yeah . - Not if they don 't find out . - Wallace . Come on . No one 's gonna do this for me . I want to make a difference , H.R. I 'm never gonna be able to if I don 't know how to use my powers . Please . I want to help people , same as you do . So show me how . Nah . Thank you for joining me , my dear . Of course . I wasn 't being much help back there anyway . You know , having powers isn 't exactly a death sentence , no matter who your doppelganger is . I attacked my friends- - my best friends- - and said horrible , horrible things to them . But that wasn 't you . And believe me , as a person who sometimes shares a body with another human being , I know the difference , and so do your friends . I 'm just so scared . What if she comes back and I can 't keep her out ? Then what ? We 'll all be there for you . Are you okay ? You 're back ! I 'm sorry . I was looking for my wife . Very funny . She 's not here . Oh , it 's so good to see you . I missed you so much . Did you ? Of course . I love you , Dad . I love you too . But I 'm sorry . We have to go . Please- - tell your mother I 'll see her soon . - Professor Stein ? - We have to leave now . Where are you ? A war is coming , Captain Hunter- - Are you sure you want me to keep going ? Yeah . Yes . Just give us five minutes . Please . You know what this is ? This is really you . Like , future you . Come on , look- - You told ' em , right ? I 'm gonna tell them , yeah , when this is finished . When this is finished ? Even though you 're about to lead them through an alien war ? Even after Flashpoint ? After everything you 've messed up ? All the lives you 've changed ? You still don 't think you should tell them ? Tell us what ? Jax and Professor Stein found a message from me in the future saying that , right now , I can 't be trusted . And why would future you say that ? I think because I went back in time and changed the timeline , and now things here are different than before I left , including some of your lives . Some of our lives ? Like who ? Cisco . Caitlin . Wally . Dig . Me ? Why ? What happened ? Apparently , you had a daughter . I had a daughter , Barry ? Baby John was Baby Sara . So , wait , you- - let me get this straight . You just , uh- - You just erased a daughter from my life ? Yeah . You can 't go back and just change things - like that , Barry . - I know . You know how hard it is for me to not alter events ? To bring my sister back ? But I don 't , because I know the implications . And all those aberrations we spent the last eight months traveling through time trying to correct- - you just decided that it was okay for you to create your own ? We should 've told ' em before . Guys ? Guys , it 's Lyla . The President 's been abducted by the Dominators . She needs us now . Okay , you guys go . All right ? I 'm gonna sit this one out . Obviously , you have Supergirl . She 's just as fast as I am . Get the President . We can talk about this later . You still trust me , right ? I 'll always trust you , but it might take more to convince them . If you need me , I 'll be there . Guys , this is cr--hey ! This is crazy ! Everyone is going , including Barry . I- - I 'm not going without him . Then you 'll be here , Oliver . Okay . You know what ? Oliver , it 's okay . I will go with them . We 'll get the President . You stay here with Barry . Sure we 're in the right place ? Well , this is the last place the President 's tracer gave a signal . Must be nearby . Yep . He 's in there . How do you know that ? I can see him . Oh , I have X-ray vision . Oh . You can see everyone 's bits with those little peepers , huh ? - No , I- - - Ignore him . How did you get the name Heat Wave ? I burned my family alive , and I like to light things on fire . Aah . Well , that 's a colorful backstory . Well , my shrink thinks so . By the way , I 'm not gonna call you Supergirl . It 's stupid . You could call me Kara . That won 't work either . Well , what 're you gonna shout if you need my help ? Skirt . Seriously ? Seriously . But I 'm not gonna need your help . Look ! The President ! Get me out of here ! This doesn 't feel right . I agree , Jefferson . Something 's coming . Release the President ! We knew you would come . Did you guys hear that ? ' Cause I heard it in my head . Yeah , we heard it . Well , if nobody else is freaked out by it , far be it for me to panic . You don 't need to harm him to get whatever it is you want from us . Release him and nothing will happen to you . He 's not who we want . It 's a trap ! Supergirl , do something ! I didn 't think about it , Oliver . I didn 't think about the future . I was so focused on the past , I didn 't think about it until now . I changed so much . What is this ? This is an article from the future . It 's a story about me vanishing . Used to be written by Iris West-Allen . But now , I don 't know . Something 's- - something 's changed with Iris . Something 's changed with our future . God , what did I do ? Barry , this is a weird-looking newspaper article . It doesn 't mean anything . You need to stop beating yourself up over this . I 'm sorry , but how can you say that ? I 'm responsible for all of this . Maybe . Maybe not . Barry , you made a choice . You wanted to see your parents alive again . Do you honestly know anyone that , if they were in your shoes , wouldn 't do the same exact thing ? I would do the exact same thing . Barry , after the Gambit went down , it was me , my father , and a crewmember on a life raft . Lost at sea . Enough food and water for one person , maybe . My father took a gun , shot the crewmember , told me to survive , and then turned the gun on himself . He shot himself in the head . He sacrificed himself so that I could live . Nothing I could do . No choice . Slade Wilson drove a sword right through my mother 's heart , in front of my sister and I. I was there . I was helpless on the ground . I was powerless to stop it . No choice . Do you not think that I wouldn 't give anything to go back and to make things different ? You never told me that . Barry , the world isn 't different because you changed the timeline . Change happens . Tragedy happens . People make choices , and those choices affect everyone else . You 're not a god , Barry . Hey , guys , wherever you are right now , we need you . Oh , things just got so much worse . Guys . Can we talk about this ? Guess not . What 's wrong with them ? I don 't know , but we need to find out . Okay ! You really did it this time ! Seriously ? Yeah , seriously . - What 's that ? - That would be heat vision . Okay . What is going on ? Barry and Oliver stayed behind while everyone went to go save the President , but now everyone 's crazy and going all " Kill Bill " on the both of them . The Dominators have them under some sort of mind control . They can 't hold them off forever . - I got to get out there . - The hell you do . They can 't beat them by themselves , especially not with Supergirl against them . Wally ? Kid Flash . Wally ? Wally ? Talk to me , Wally . Hey ! Come on . Guys . Wally 's hurt bad , but he 's alive . Let 's get an ETA on overriding the mind control ! - Bingo ! - Yahtzee ! You go first . You go first . It 's your office . There 's a weird signal coming from the salt mines . For the record , that is what I was gonna say . Can you jam it ? Uh , no . How many of those do you have left ? Probably not enough . Okay , this hallway leads to a bunker under the building . Just hold ' em off as long as you can . Where are you going ? If they can 't shut it down , maybe she can . Hey , Supergirl ! Let 's finally see who 's faster . Too slow . - What is he doing ? - He 's making her angry . But he knows Supergirl is invincible . Think maybe that 's the point . Barry ? Guys , they 're back . What happened ? You didn 't kill me , so my day 's looking up . I 'm so sorry . Hey , you 're not the first superhero to be mind-controlled . Okay , I know what you 're gonna say , but I had to do something . I 'm glad you 're okay . Don 't ever do that again . Sorry . Not sorry . Come on . Let 's get you checked out . And then we can talk about how dumb that was . Okay . Okay . Okay what ? They don 't see your potential . I do . One of my many gifts . You want to train ? I 'll train you . So , what was it like being all mind-controlled and stuff ? I didn 't realize he had a mind to be controlled . Barry , about before . Message or no message , we 're with you . Thank you . Where 's Supergirl ? Scanning the city to make sure there aren 't any more of the orbs that whammied all of you . - Okay , so now what ? - We call Lyla . Tell her these Dominators aren 't here peacefully . Sara ! Everybody inside ! Go ! Skirt . Seriously ? Seriously . But I 'm not gonna need your help . Look ! The President ! Get me out of here ! This doesn 't feel right . I agree , Jefferson . Something 's coming . Release the President ! We knew you would come . Did you guys hear that ? ' Cause I heard it in my head . Yeah , we heard it . Well , if nobody else is freaked out by it , far be it for me to panic . You don 't need to harm him to get whatever it is you want from us . Release him and nothing will happen to you .

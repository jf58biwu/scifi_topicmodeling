 Previously on " the 100 " ... The only way to save both our people Is if we join together . Without someone on the inside to lower their defenses , An army 's useless . You should go . I can get you through the tunnels . [ lincoln groaning ] How about getting me down , maya ? Don 't move ! Agh ! Take him into custody . I 'm sorry . They take their orders from me now . Put my father in quarantine . Yes , mr . President . Bellamy : They 're already using their blood , And things are gonna get ugly in here real fast . [ alarm blaring ] No ! Clarke : I have a message for your leader . We 're coming for him . Let our people go , and we 'll let you live . It 's an 8-hour walk back to mount weather . You 're gonna do it in 6 . [ panting ] Ugh ! [ beep beep ] [ gasping ] [ beeping ] [ air hissing ] [ breathing deeply ] Sir , you 're too far ... From the door , way too far . Just breathe . Don 't worry about me . You did it , didn 't you , sir ? Huh ? The marrow treatment , it worked . We did it , lieutenant . The ground is ours . The ground is ours . Miller : We 've been locked up for hours . If it was bellamy- - It was bellamy . I 'm telling you he 's here . All right . It doesn 't make any sense . I know what i saw . [ buzzer ] Not again . Back up , everyone . Back up . Move ! No , no ! Hey , hey ! Get off her ! Tsing : No , not her . She needs more time to recover . This one . No ! Wait , wait ! No , please ! No ! Jasper : Stop ! You can 't keep doing this to us . President wallace said we could go . That president wallace is no longer in command . He had to step down for health reasons . I 'm sorry it has to be like this . I hope you know you 're all incredibly special to us . Guard : Clear out . Go . [ buzzer ] Has he checked in yet ? No . You worried someone 's gonna try and take a shot at you Inside the ark ? Wait outside , ryder . Lexa 's orders . Whatever , clarke . He 's late . What if something 's happened to him ? He 'll be fine . You 've been busy . Why are you focusing on the dam ? I told you acid fog was our priority . Until bellamy gets eyes on their dispersal system , There 's only so much i can do . Fine . Tell me about the dam . Can we cut off their power ? Maybe . I 'm still playing with a few things . How many of these have you made ? Only two so far , but- - Two ? That 's not enough . There will be reapers everywhere . High-frequency tone generators don 't grow on trees , clarke . Wick is scrounging for parts . Raven , i am about to leave for tondc , Where lexa and the heads of all 12 grounder clans Are waiting for me to tell them we 're ago , Only we 're not ago because they still have acid fog , And we only have two tone generators . Hey . We 'll be ready . We will . Bellamy on radio : Ark station , do you read me ? Anybody there ? Bellamy , you 're late . Every 3 hours means every 3 hours . Are you through ? Have you found the source of the acid fog ? No . That 's gonna have to wait . What ? No . Nothing is more important than that . Our friends are . They 're starting to take them from the dorm One at a time every few hours . Taking them where ? I don 't know . We tried to follow them , But they went to a classified level . Maya borrowed the schematics of the vent system From her boss , and i 'm still trying To find a way in . Anything ? I think i found a path , But it 's gonna be tight . Here 's the walkie raven asked for And the earbud . We 're going to make him mobile so he can talk to us from anywhere . Bellamy , you have to find them . That 's the plan . If you don 't , all of this is for nothing . Yeah . I 'll be right back . I thought were going to tondc . Plans have changed . I 'm staying here . The commander 's expecting you . Our people inside mount weather are in trouble . I 'm not going anywhere until i know they 're ok . And what can you do for them from here ? You 'll go to tondc in my place . Lexa respects you . I 'll get there soon as i can . Clarke , wait . Put it away . Clarke , being a good leader means Knowing which battles to fight . And which to delegate . I know . Please i need you to go to tondc . Fine . I 'll go . Thank you . What is it ? Kane will explain . Perhaps your mother should go . She is still the chancellor after all . Which is why she 's needed here . Heavy lies the crown . She shouldn 't be wearing the crown , And you shouldn 't be backing her up . What is that ? A note . Thelonious is gone . He told sinclair to wait two days Before giving that to us . The city of light . He says he 's coming back to save us again . He took 12 people , 12 guns . You can 't go after him . We can 't spare the men . Oh , don 't worry about it . Clarke wouldn 't let me Even if i wanted to . Godspeed , thelonious . Sir , do you recognize anything ? Their tent was near here . I 'm sure of it . What 's the matter ? You guys got someplace better to be ? You see anyone ? [ speaking grounder ] We mean you no harm . Do you speak english ? What do you want ? Nothing . It looks like you could use a hand . What are you doing out here alone ? My brother and i were on our way to the city of light , And wastelanders attacked . They took our horse , all our water , everything . They killed him . This cart is all i have left . Give her some water . Whoa , no , no , no , no , no . We barely have enough for ourselves here . Touch me again , and i 'll end you . In a noncriminal way . It 's ok . We 're on our way to the city of light , as well . What 's your name ? Emori . Everyone in the dead zone Is looking for the city of light . Almost no one finds it . I can get you there . If you pull my cart . Done . Caspian , you 're on the first shift . Thanks for the water . It 's , uh--it was no problem . [ indistinct voices ] Raven on radio : Ok . So tell us where you 're at now . I 'm at an intersection . Which way ? Ok . He just passed the air filtration system On this floor , which puts him about here . Bellamy , we think you 're close . The lab should be up ahead . Any chance you can be more specific ? [ drill whirring ] Never mind . I got this . [ drill whirring ] [ whirring continues ] Is that a drill ? Bone marrow extraction . You ready for the last treatment You 'll ever need , lieutenant ? You have no idea . I 've waited my whole life To breathe fresh air . That 's emerson . Cage : Let 's get back to this secret army That she claims to have . She tell you anything that might Help us find it ? [ drill whirring ] Stop drilling , please . The window for extraction after death Is incredibly short . I only need a minute . Emerson : No , sir . Nothing about the army . She did say she was coming for you And that if we let her people go She 'll let our people live . It 's a little late for that . I 'm sorry i failed , sir . No , it 's ok . We 'll finish the job tonight . Whitman just radioed in . Apparently there 's a war council meeting Happening tonight in one of their villages , And all the leaders are gonna be there . Sir , i feel good . Let me take a team out And support whitman . No . He has less chance of being spotted if he 's alone . Sir , whitman 's good , But he can 't take out that many targets alone . Which is why we 're gonna use a missile . This time , we 're not gonna miss . Please tell me you heard all that . We heard it . We have to warn them . Did kane take a radio ? No . This is the only unjammed frequency . We have to keep it open for bellamy . If i leave now , i can make it there in time . In time to be blown up , you mean . When i get back , i want to know Our friends are safe and the acid fog is down . Can you handle that ? Yeah , we can handle it . Go . Clarke , wait . Octavia was in tondc when i left . Is--is she , um ... She 's here . She 's safe . Ok . Good . Be safe , too . I will . Octavia 's in tondc for the meeting . Why 'd you lie ? Bellamy can 't be distracted . It helps no one . Hey . Don 't get blown up . [ clang ] [ indistinct chatter ] Last time , they stepped foot here , We were at war with each other . Now the 12 clans fight together . Remember this day . You may never see one like it again . You haven 't heard a word i 've said . Sorry . Bellamy left lincoln in the tunnels two days ago , And he should be back- - Lincoln is no longer your concern . Look . I 've done everything you 've asked me to do , And i 'll continue to do so , But what you 're asking now is impossible . I 'm not asking . We 're at war , and a warrior does not mourn Those she 's lost till after the battle is won . Go stand watch with the other seconds . Assassins from the mountain Will try again . We need to be ready . Murphy : So i got to ask . What made you ditch your home And risk your life to cross the beach from hell ? It doesn 't matter . No . Come on . Take my mind Off all the fun we 're having . It wasn 't my decision to leave . Kicked out ? Ok . Now i 'm interested . What 'd you do ? If i told you , You would not look at me the same . Maybe . Then again , i might surprise you . What about you ? How did you end up in the dead zone ? I could tell you the gory details , But since you 're one of the few people on this planet Who doesn 't hate me at the moment , I don 't think i want to blow it . Now i 'm interested . Ok . You really want to know ? I killed two people , Tried to kill two more . I had my reasons , but nobody cared . I 'm the bad guy . Told you i 'd blow it . My people saw me as a stain On the bloodline , Something to erase . Then screw them . I wouldn 't cover it up . I think it 's pretty badass . Liar . [ buzzer ] Guard : Get back ! I said get back . Here we go . Come on . Like we talked about ! Link up ! This one . Guard : All right . Let 's go . Everybody now ! Clear the way ! [ shouting ] Aah ! Hey ! Let go of me ! Are you trying to get yourself killed ? Bellamy ? Just shut up and listen . They 're killing them . Next time they come , you have to fight back Harder than this , do you understand ? Here . Take this . Get everyone ready . Ready for what ? What 's the plan ? I 'm working on it . Find dante . He 's on our side . He 'll help us . Ok . Hey ! Everything ok over there ? Yes , sir . Unh ! [ screaming ] Help ! Please , somebody . No ! [ buzzer ] [ classical music playing ] [ beep ] [ door opens ] Your evening meal , president wallace . [ turns up volume ] Who are you ? Jasper sent me . We need your help . Your son is killing my friends . I 'm a prisoner , same as them . A prisoner who knows every inch of this mountain , Every security measure . Who 's helping you ? That 's not important right now . After clarke escaped , I had all exits fortified And put under extra surveillance . My son has no doubt changed All access and entrance codes by now . Your friends will never even make it off of level 5 . I won 't let them die here . I 'm sorry . I can 't help them escape . But i may be able to buy them some time . Ryder : Hyah ! Hyah ! Octavia : Clarke , you made it . I need you to take me to lexa . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Is bellamy ready ? Did he get the acid fog down ? He 's working on it . Whitman to mount weather command . Final target has landed . All targets accounted for . Emerson : Copy that . Standing by for the president . Clarke of the sky people has Honored us with her presence . I 'm sorry i 'm late , commander . Kane : You made good time . I assume the kids at mount weather are ok . For now . Can we talk in private ? Yes . This way . A missile ? You 're sure ? Yes . We have to start evacuating now . No . What do you mean no , lexa ? If we evacuate , they 'll know we have A spy inside their walls . Not necessarily . We can 't risk it . What 's the point of having an inside man If we can 't act on what he tells us ? Is the acid fog disabled ? Is our sleeping army uncaged ? Then bellamy 's job is not done . Without him , we can 't win this war . So what are you saying ? We just do nothing , Let them bomb us ? It will be a blow , But our army will be safe inside the woods , And it will inspire them . And what about us ? We slip away right now . Put this on . Lexa , wait . You don 't understand . I provoked mount weather . I sent a message to distract them from bellamy . Clarke , sometimes , you have to concede a battle to win a war . No . We can iform the leaders of the clans , Pick a rendezvous point in the woods . Each of them can slip out separately . And how many more people will they tell ? Where do we draw the line ? Well , then cancel the meeting , Start a fire , something ! Clarke , we don 't have time for this . No , no ! This is wrong ! It 's also our only choice , and you know it . You could have warned everyone up there , But you didn 't . You said nothing , not even to your own people . This is war , clarke . People die . You showed true strength today . Don 't let emotions stop you now . It 's time to go . Chancellor , look out ! Hold your fire ! Wait ! Whoa , whoa . Emori : Everybody put your weapons And supplies in the cart , And nobody gets hurt . If we give you our supplies , we 'll all die out here . If you don 't , you 'll die right here . Do as she says . Now ! How 's your faith holding up , chancellor ? Shut up . Unwavering . You don 't want to do this . Stop walking ! We all came out here searching for a better life , Same as you . Maybe we can find it If we work together . Thanks ... But no . [ speaks foreign language ] Now , everyone , back away from the cart And get on your knees . Now ! Do what she says . You , too . Oh , what a surprise . You 're just like everyone else . [ whispers ] Good luck , john . Raven on radio : Talk to me . What do you see ? Close your eyes . Imagine a bottomless pit . Just stick with it . According to dante 's coordinates , You 're almost there . What 's happening on your end ? Did they evacuate tondc ? Don 't know yet , but it 's clarke . She 'll get it done . Just concentrate on squeezing your ass through that vent And stop worrying about your sister . Octavia 's in tondc ? She 's there ? Raven . She 's gonna be ok . Clarke fired out of here . She 's gonna get there on time . How could you keep this from me ? Clarke was trying to protect you . Listen . You still have a job to do . I know you 're worried about octavia , But you have to focus . Let 's just get this done . [ indistinct chatter ] Should be at the meeting , Not watching the trees with you . [ rustling ] Quiet . There 's someone out there . This one 's mine , sky girl . Atohl ? [ grunting ] Lincoln ? What are you doing ? Get away from him . Gah ! I said get away from him ! You don 't understand . I can 't fight it . Yes , you can . We can . I betrayed your brother . He 's a prisoner in the mountain because of me . Lincoln , i don 't know what happened between you two , But bellamy made it , he 's fine . We 've got our inside man . Now i need you to come with me . Unh ! Grounders don 't give up . We fight . Either you get up and we fight this , Or you crawl away and die alone like a coward . It 's your choice . Jaha : John . Come on . We got to go . [ coughs ] Caspian : There . He 's up . It 's about time . Quiet , caspian . You all right ? Caspian : If he 's not , we 're leaving him here . I 'm ok . It 's time to go home . And where exactly is that ? Sir , i know you 're trying to take us to a better place , But look around . We 've got no food , we 've got no water , And no idea how to find it . Murphy : Due north . She said due north . What is due north , john ? She was talking about the city of light . Did she say that ? No . Did she say how far due north ? No . She didn 't , but she wouldn 't be sending us there If we couldn 't make it . Caspian : Who 's that ? The liar and the thief Who robbed us and knocked you out ? Sir , i really hope you are not considering this . John , we have no weapons and no rations . If we go north and you 're wrong , Then all of us will die . If we turn back now , we live . So that 's it ? We 've reached the point of no return ? You just want to give up ? I didn 't say that . You didn 't not say it either . That is the north star . After you . The rest of you need to decide for yourselves , But either way , we 'll come back for you When we find it . Sir , this is a mistake . You 're not gonna find it , you 're not gonna make it . I believe ... This is what they call having faith , john . Faith ? Nah . Just have nothing better to do . Pal needs your auth code , sir . Emerson : Ok . Activated . She 's live . Whitman , are you in position ? Over . Whitman radio : Affirmative , sir . Generating target coordinates now . Over . Lexa : Clarke , we have to keep moving . We 're not far enough away . The last time they used a missile , It was before i was born . According to legend , it left a hole in the woods You could not see across . Now let 's go . What if we made them miss ? You 're not listening . With a weapon like that , you can 't miss . Yes , you can . I heard them talking about a spotter , Someone in the field to aim the missile . If we could just find him . No . What 's she doing here ? Clarke , you can 't go back . Clarke ! Whitman : North 38 degrees , 54 minutes , .25 seconds . Copy . By west 77 degrees , 2 minutes , .12 seconds . Over . [ beeping ] We 're locked in . Standing by for confirmation . Mom , what are you doing here ? I told you to stay back at camp . Enough , clarke . I 'm the chancellor . I don 't need your permission to go- - No . We have to leave now . What is going on ? We can 't be here . Mom , i am begging you . Please . Come on . Where 's the commander ? Where 's clarke ? I don 't know . Last time i saw them , they were heading downstairs . They 're not there now . We should search the woods . I agree . I 'll tell the others . Final targets confirmed . We are go for launch . On your command , sir . Fire . Bird is in the air . Impact in 10 , 9 ... Wait ! No . We can 't stop . There 's no time . I am not taking a step further Until you tell me what is happening . [ missile whooshing ] Emerson : 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . [ ears ringing ] [ muffled , distant screaming ] [ faint ] mom . Mom , are you ok ? Oh , my god . Come on . We can 't be here . [ normal volume ] we--we have to go . You knew . You knew , and you let this happen ? We had no choice . So many people . Our people . No . We had to protect bellamy . Without him- - Oh , stop it ! I don 't want to hear it . Mom ... Tell me this was lexa . Please , clarke . Please tell me this wasn 't you . I wish i could . You can 't tell anyone about this . If anyone finds out that we knew , The alliance of the 12 clans will break . We 'll lose the war . You crossed the line . Mom . Their blood is on your hands , And even if we win , I 'm afraid you won 't be able to wash it off this time . Don 't worry . Your secret is safe with me . Mom ... Wait . Mom ! [ people crying and moaning ] Monty : What 's taking bellamy so long ? I don 't know . Maybe they caught him . No . He 'll figure a way out , i know he will . Jasper , it 's already been 4 hours . The guards will be back any second . They 're gonna take someone else . No . Listen to me . Everyone , we stick to the plan . They 're not taking anyone else Out of this room without a fight ! [ buzzer ] Get ready . Disperse . This one . Yes , ma 'am . No ! No ! No ! Hey ! Get your hands off him ! - Enough ! - Don 't move ! Take him instead . No , you can 't ! Get up . No ! Jasper ! Not jasper ! [ jasper screaming ] Search the rest . Make sure there are no other weapons . Yes , ma 'am . You heard her . Let 's go ! As soon as we 're in the lab , I want him prepped . We start immediately . Copy that . Transporting asset , elevator " c . " Ugh . Something 's wrong . Unh ! Radiation . We need to get out of here . My skin ! Containment breach level 5 . Seal the whole floor . [ screaming ] Bellamy . Raven on radio : You got to pull the outside air in To reverse the air filtration system . Just tell me how we know if it 's even working . Voice on p.A. : Containment breach . I 'd say it 's working . Thank you , mr . President . Jasper : Let 's go ! This is our chance ! Everybody move ! Take the level ! Monty , get the cameras . Miller , get their guns . Go ! No . You can 't . I hope you know that you 're incredibly special to us . [ wailing ] Who helped them ? Who helped them ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You still have influence , People who believe in you , And one of them irradiated level 5 today . I want to know who it is . It was me . Well , you and whoever helped you Killed 11 of our people today , And for what ? We 're gonna retake their level soon enough . Get out of my sight , cage . I know we disagree ... But this will all be over soon . I bombed tondc today . My father installed that silo to protect us , cage . Why can 't you see that that is exactly what i 'm trying to do ? With clarke and the commander dead , The savages can go back to killing each other , And then we can retake the ground . And it only cost you your souls ! He 's ready . What are you doing ? Freeing you . Restrain him . Easy , easy . Do not hurt him . Cage : The marrow kicks in in 48 hours . You 'll thank me someday . [ people screaming , crying ]

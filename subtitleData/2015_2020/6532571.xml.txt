Man , do you think that Tori 'd ever let me diddle her honeypot ? - You 're gonna bring this up again ? - I 'm just saying , dude . I think I 've got a shot .

We 're not sure , at least not at this moment . Whether we 're under ... - Nobody even knows what the hell is going on . - Just throwing darts against the wall . - Is this about the planes from this morning ? - Where have you guys been ? I mean , the last plane was like an hour ago ! I mean ... nine planes , that ain 't no accident . - We will first pray for those who 've had friends and family involved .

Come on , we 're gonna get killed if we sit here . - That 's them . - There 's too many . - We have to go ! - There 's too many ! - Go ! - It 's okay . - What 's okay ? We just left all those people out there to die . - We didn 't have time . They would have killed us too . - I ... I could have waited . I could have fit a few of them . - They were already dead . - That 's bullshit ! Okay ? Alright . We saw them running . I saw them running and I I can 't make that excuse . - It 's just how it is . - How can you act like that when there 's innocent people being killed ? - Hey ! If you 've been in your car this whole time , let me tell you : you have some shit ahead of you . I 've seen enough death in the last 24 hours to know how to save myself . I 'm not trying to be heartless , just ... Is that your family ? - It 's my wife . - Do you have kids ? - No . - Could you imagine if you did ? In a time like this how would you explain it to them ? First we 'll protect them . - You mean Amy ? - What were you waiting for ? - What ? - You and your wife . Why were you waiting to have kids ? - Isn 't it a bit forward on you , don 't you think ? - I 'm just talking . - I know that we never even wanted kids . - You 're married . That 's just what other people want from you . Okay , so what was your excuse then ? - I don 't know . I guess first it was work mostly . Well , full time , then you 're overtime ... I don 't know . I ... I guess we both just wanted to get to a certain point before we felt like we could you know ... settle down and ... eventually . - Eventually ... So you really think you 're gonna find your wife in all this mess ? - Yes . - If I were you , I 'd prepare myself not to . - You know what ? I ... I don 't need this . Okay ? Don 't talk like that . - I 'm not trying ... - No , it 's none of your business . She 's ... she 's smart . Alright ? She 'll be fine . - Alright . - She ... she could be out there . But I don 't think that it 's a good idea for you to go looking for her . - Well , thank you for your sympathy . - It would just ... it would be nice to save just one life today . that 's all I 'm saying . - I 'll be fine . - I 'm Samantha . - I 'm David . - Hi . - Whew . Thank God ! Are you okay ? - Yeah . - I got a hell of a time getting ahold of you , - Yeah , the news said that most of the cellphone towers are down . - And most of the roads are closed , too . Is everything okay ? - No ... - Are you hurt ? - Kailey 's sick . She ... She couldn 't move her body , she couldn 't ... I don 't know what was wrong with her . - Where is she ? - Um ... a neighbor took her to the vet . - Thank God you 're alright . - Wait , wait , wait . What time is it ? - Almost three . I couldn 't wait . After last night , I had to see you . - Well , what 's been happening ? - Haven 't you seen the news ? - I fell asleep . Is it ... I mean , did I miss something ? - Let 's just get you some coffee . You have no idea how good it is to be here . - It could be something atmospheric ... okay , that 's causing planes to crash , It could be something extraterrestrial , basically it 's beyond our field of vision right now . It 's a Black Swan event and we 're not equipped to deal with it . - The neighbor 's a vet . He works out of his house and I take her . - Wait , I ... I can 't leave . Not with everything that 's going on . - What could possibly happen here ? - I don 't know ... I can 't not be here if they come back and ... I don 't ... I don 't know what to do . - When I was driving over here today , there was only one thing that I could think of . All the money , all the success , it meant nothing , The only thing that mattered to me was that I got one more chance to see you and tell you that the only way that anything could matter again was if we could share it together . You and me . - I can 't . - Yes you can . And you know what you have , right here . I know . - Don 't . That 's not fair . - None of this is fair , Amy . You don 't know how much time you have left with everything that 's going on . I want this . I want this . - I ... I have to stay . Even if it 's a small chance , I have to . - If I leave , right now , without you , there is no way that we can know what could happen . - I can 't ... - That 's good . It 's good . She 's gonna be okay . Just stay inside . Okay ? Look , babe , I 'm having a really hard time staying awake . I mean I 'm just gonna ... I 'm gonna pull over really quick and just take a quick nap . I 'm tired . Look , I 'm going to make it back to you , okay ? I 'm going to make it back to you . You trust me ? - I trust you . - Everything 's gonna be okay . Well , Samantha , no ... no kids , eh ? - No . - Did you have an excuse ? - Well , when I first got married , we said that we would wait until we could afford to get a pool for the backyard . But I don 't think that was it . He got a good job and ... I got a better job . We surpassed that . We didn 't get the pool for the backyard . We stopped talking about having kids . It 's so interesting , isn 't it ? What people think marriage is for at the beginning ? it 's like a ... a free ticket out of our old life . It 's always gonna be better . Or at least you 're not gonna grow old and die alone with no one beside you . But for me that that ... that feeling comes from disappointing someone , that ... that never really went away for me . Even ... even in the good times . We were married seven years . We had the divorce papers all ready to sign before all this happened . With the strange timing pf it all I still managed to become separated . All these feelings that you have in the end shouldn 't shouldn 't make up for all the boredom and disappointment that that you felt before . Should they ? - You know that ... software I got you last year makes changing music much easier . - But there 's no connection to the notes . I ... I like writing by hand . - Well , I was going to take Kylie out , Decompress a bit . Do you want to take a break and come along ? - You know , I 'm ... I 'm kind of at a place where I shouldn 't stop . Please . - Yeah , no problem . - I 'm taking a job with Brad . - Oh , so that 's it then ? You 've decided ? - One of us has to do something . One last thing for us to not talk about . - Come on . Seriously ? It 's not always like this . - I know how it is . - I have to go to Denver . - Maybe that 's best . - Hello ? - I wasted it . - Ryan , where are you ? - I 'm alone . And you know who gives a shit ? No one . - Settle down , you 've been drinking ... . - Damn right . I 've been drinking . No one even knows I 'm here , Amy . Tori 's probably dead and David bailed . ... and it hits me I 've got nothing . Hey , hey ... it 's okay . Hey , Hey . Hey there ... hi . Um ... where 's your family at ? I don 't know where my family is either . Can I sit here ? It looks like you have an owey there , huh ? David ... Is he ... is he home yet ? Oh , let me take a look . Oh , it 's gonna be okay . Oh ! Is that your bow ? Can you hold this here for me ? You know ... I can be looking to find my family a a long time , so maybe we should just try and try and find yours , okay ? You know ... what direction do you think they went ? Oh , that way ? Okay . Come here . Come here . How did he know it 's over ? - What ? - David ? He knows it 's over between you two . He told me how rough it 's been . - Of course . Damn it . What are you ... doing ? - Are you okay ? What are you doing out here alone ? Where 's your family ? - Get away from her ! - I was just trying to make sure she was alright ! I am on your side ! Does your phone work ? Hello ! Is she okay ? - Get out of here ! - I just want to get home . Do you know the quickest way to Salt Lake ? - Get ... off ... my ... land ! - Okay , alright . You got it . I 'm just gonna get some water And then I 'm leaving . I really appreciate this . - No ! No ! it 's in the water . Whatever they 're bringing , its They put something in the water ! They got my animals . They took my family . They ain 't getting no more ! - So who 's ... who 's ' they ' ? Jesus ... What is this ? - In or out ? Let 's go ! Those bastards want a fight ; they got it . - Damn it , Kate ! I said no more ! No more ! No more . Anything comes through that door , I 'm emptying this thing . Shit ... I forgot to lock the back door . Shit ! Caitlin , no ! Stop ! - Ah ! Ah ! Ow ! Ah ... Ah ! Ah ! - Sam ! - Lori ? Lori ! Sam , what happened ? Sam ! Someone help us ! Tell him I 'm gonna go get my keys . Dan , you stay with her , okay ? - No ! No ! - Brad wants to start a firm with me . - That was pretty quick . What about Chemtech ? - He quit ... two weeks ago . And he already has everything in place . New office , new clients ... It 'll be ... smaller , but ... I mean something . I 'll actually feel like I 'm making a difference . - Well , what about things around here ? - That is so unfair . - What ? - Don 't make me feel guilty about this . What have you done for us ? - I 'm going to that wedding with you tomorrow , I mean that 's ... . - She 's your cousin . Did you quit your job ? Or put your dreams on hold ? Have you done anything for us ? - I 've cut way back on work ! You know that ! - Then where are you every day ? Every night ? - Just give me a minute , okay ? I got ... - I can 't compete with your damn phone ! I ... I ... I 'm done . - Okay fine ! It 's off now ! Now everything is going to be better ! Maybe now with my phone off . we might be able to have a conversation at dinner ! Or no , maybe all our fights will turn into polite discussions ! I ... I should have known this whole time it would be this phone ! The phone is the only problem ! It 's just the phone ! - David ? Do you want me to take over ? - No , I 'm good . - I think I know where we are now . I can get us into the valley if you want to take a nap . - It 's okay , I ... No really , I 'm good . - Shit ! What was that ? Was that a person ? - I didn 't get a good look , okay ? - It 's one of them . - We gotta go . - Wait , no . - Why ? Samantha , come on , we don 't have time for this . I 'm not gonna pick that up . - How else are you gonna protect yourself ? Think about it . - No , no , no ... Oh , shit . - Oh my God . - Shit ! - What 's wrong ? - Come on ! - What ? - it is not working . Shit ! What 's that ? - Oh , God . - Let 's just leave him there . - ? something different . - Well , how far do you think we have ? - Four or five miles probably . - Alright , let 's get out of here . - Okay . - So you know this road ? - Yeah ... I 'm pretty sure . - Okay . - It 's somewhere , okay ? If it 's not at the mouth of canyon , that 's close . - Well , what if it isn 't ? - Then I 'll keep walking till I find it . - Well , what if there is no evacuation point ? - If there isn 't , then I 'm dead . - You know ... You can sleep with me if you want ... - Thanks . - I just don 't understand how you 're so comfortable with the idea of death . - The same goes for you . - I 'm not comfortable with the idea of death . I ... Are you ... are you okay ? Are you hurt ? - Uh , no , I just wanted to lay down . Wow , that 's so embarrassing . No , I 'm fine . - You tired or ... - No , it 's pretty nice down here actually .. - Yeah ? - Yeah . Are you gonna let me look at that ? Please ? - No , it 's just ... I 'm alright . - No , it needs to be cleaned . Maybe I ... No , it 's not gonna take that long and you need to take a break anyway . Here . Okay . - So glad I found a doctor . - Shut up . I 'm just tired of you whip around everywhere . So ... - So ... - What do you want to talk about ? - They killed Sam and Maureen . They tried to kill me too , and I ... I don 't know what to do . I never thought I 'd have to prepare for this . I 'm sorry ... I was aware about Brad , he ... he came over and I ... He 's been over before and it didn 't mean anything . - Sorry . Does it hurt ? Are you okay ? - This feels great , yeah . - Okay ... Come on ... Talk to me for once . - I 'll talk , I just ... Don 't have much to say . - Now I know you 're lying . What 's Amy like ? - She 's ... she 's strong . And a lot of other things . - Was she happy ? - Um ... That 's a good question . You know , I could guess but ... I 've been wrong before . She doesn 't smile much , but she 's always kind of been that way . When I first me her , I ... I just thought she was unhappy . I guess everything 's on me though . I messed up a lot . Especially in the beginning . I ... I was unfaithful . One night I ... told her . And then I just left . I ... I didn 't give her time to even react , I just ... I didn 't want to see her . So a few days later I went to the house . And ... um ... she met me at the door and ... uh ... she smiled . Quitting hadn 't even crossed her mind . I um ... I stayed . Felt like she deserved for me to not quit . - So you 're looking for her so you can go sweep her off her feet ? - No , I don 't know why I 'm looking for her . I haven 't been happy in a long time . And uh ... even if I do find her , I I don 't know what will happen . - Maybe she doesn 't want to be found . - She does . - Evacuation point Come on , hurry . - Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! - Hey ! Hey ! hey ! - We 're looking for the evacuation point ! - We got everyone out . ? - We got room , but we got to go now ! Come on ! - David ? ! - Hey we gotta go ! - She 's not there ! - How do you know that ? - We 're too far from home ; she can 't be out here ! - Come on ! Everybody 's dead and I don 't you to die ! - I hope you can find me ... - I can 't die alone . - Hey stop ! You gotta stop ! The end

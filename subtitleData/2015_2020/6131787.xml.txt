 It 's election time again . Now can i count on your support for school trustee ? I 've been thinking of running against you . Really ? ( grunts ) Professor ethan duncan was here . His research ? It 's at dyad , i assume . The island of dr moreau . It was a gift from professor duncan . This could be his key . Delphine : Until three weeks ago We didn 't even know project castor existed . We intercepted them as they were forcing her Into the trunk of a car . But this one killed two members of the security team , - And the other one got away . - What are they after ? Delphine : He says he 'll only talk to you . Count your sisters . Mrs s : It was the only way i could see to get you out of dyad . Sarah : Betray my sister ? - For kira . - That 's not your bloody decision ! Hello , brother . There 's an issue . ( woman laughing ) - And here we are . - ( laughs ) oh , sorry . Oh . Just hold on a second . There 's some adjustments required . - You got it ? - Ooh ! Almost . Oh , that is so much better . I thought you were special forces . Shouldn 't you have a penthouse ? Cutbacks . Oh . But you are actually a soldier , right ? 'cause i once met this guy who said he was a swat cop , But then it turned out that he sold horse feed for a living . Oh , thank you . ( coughs ) Okay . ( chuckles ) Can i take your coat ? Sure . You 're a formal dude . Has anyone ever told you that before ? Manners were stressed in my house . Hmm , really ? And where was that again ? - North korea ? - ( both chuckling ) Mmm . ( laughs ) ( moaning ) What ? What the hell 's going on ? This is seth . Listen , guys , this is not what i signed up for . But we 're brothers . We were taught to share . ( theme music playing ) Well , delphine 's buggered off to europe . She 's covering rachel 's business . She says that dyad 's off my back , though . - Do you believe her ? - ( sighs ) I don 't know . No . Hey , what are we doing here ? - ( clears throat ) - i need to call cosima . I get it . Your sisters need you . But i want you to see this . ( sarah clears throat ) Go ahead . Come on in . Is this your house ? Yup . - It is now . - ( door closes ) Take a look . Tell me what you think . - I hate surprises . - ( chuckles ) I didn 't think you 'd come if told you . You can afford this place ? I 'll figure it out . You 're a bloody lumberjack . - How are you gonna live in the city ? - ( chuckles ) Kira : Mom ! ( stutters ) yeah . I bought that for myself , But it shrank in the rain on the way back home , So i was thinking maybe you could use it . ( giggles ) Is there anything about this you like ? Yes . Yes . Good . - Piss off ! - ( laughs ) You were talking in your sleep again . What 'd i say ? General whimpering , sorrows , regrets , How much you miss me while i 'm gone . - ( grunts ) shut up . - ( laughs ) ( knocking on door ) - It 's him . - ( groans ) Hey . At ease , soldier . Major . ( gasps ) Glad to see you 're out safe . I met sarah manning . - Inside ? - But not a prisoner . She strolled in like the queen of manchester making demands . Does that seem right to you , her and dyad working together ? I don 't know her like you do , sir . Sit down . You 're first . Some bags are pockets . No pocket is a pouch . Conclusion , all bags are not pouches . - False . - ( systems buzzing ) Some pigs are predators . No predator is a pet . Conclusion , some pigs are not pets . - True . - ( systems buzzing ) Some maggots are flies . No fly is welcome . Conclusion , no maggots are welcome . - False . - ( systems buzzing ) Some doctors are fools . All fools are rich . Conclusion , some doctors are rich . True or false ? Some doctors are rich . True or false ? - True . - ( electronic beeping ) He 's tired . We drank last night . Understood . Your extraction orders . We 're not done here . We don 't have the original sample . Separate pickups , don 't be seen together . You travel this evening . Is that coming from mother or from you ? You have your orders . Clean up and clear out . You 're going back to base . ( electronic music playing ) My god , you must be scott . ( chuckles ) hey . Scott : Yes . The bloodwork 's very encouraging , But i want to get you into an mri . That treatment , though , the one from kira 's tooth , That 's working , yeah ? I mean , it 's possible it 's suddenly this efficacious , but ... I know people have rebounds all the time . I could just as easily dip tomorrow . I know . Cosima , these numbers , they 're great . I just can 't explain them . Erm , maybe it 's about more than numbers . - Scott : What do you mean ? - Are you suggesting a spiritual component ? Scott : A what ? I 'm not decamping to an ashram , felix . - Felix : Thank god for that . - ( chuckles ) i 'm just ... Just open to perspectives on the void . Like , before it opens up and swallows me , We have to get back to the lab . I don 't trust dr nealon , cosima . No . Of course not . Why would you ? Delphine put him in charge . But i will say one thing , He 's twice the researcher leekie ever was . He 's an md , he 's a brilliant geneticist And he wants a meeting this afternoon . Felix : That 's four things . Are you taking this bait ? I just need to know because i 've got other patients to see . Yeah . Yeah . There 's work to be done . Okay . Take one of these . - Can i get the old one ? - Mmm-hmm . New day , new phones . Blue as the skies of lesvos . Alison : I could beat her , donnie . I could beat her like a french meringue . Donnie : I know . Alison : I 'm not gonna let her put our kids in the ghetto . ( laughs ) okay , easy . It 's just the next district over . Have you seen the playgrounds ? There 's no rubber mulch . It 's gravel . It 's like the ' 70s . Still , we agreed . We can 't afford a campaign . At least not until i get back on my feet . Well , i told her that i 'm running . What ? Ali , we are spread very thin right now . We might have to sell the house . And what would we do with the corpse in the garage ? Whoa ! Ixnay on that . - Come on . - What would we do ? Are we gonna give it to the next family ? - Or do we take it with us ? - Okay . I know you 're upset , but come on . Team hendrix . Down but not out , am i right ? Fist me . Fist me . - Fist you ? - Dad , my cleats ! Okay . That 's the saying . ( indistinct chatter ) Hi . Hello , mrs hendrix . Hello , ramon . What are you doing here ? Are you kidding ? Half my clients are soccer moms . You 're selling pills at a kids ' sports tournament ? Speaking of which , haven 't heard from you in a while . Guess you 're still clean , huh ? Yes , very much so . - Nice . Congratulations . - Thank you . I 'm actually getting out of the business myself , so ... ( stutters ) you 're closing your business ? Going to college . Yeah . - Say hi to your mother . - I will . Who 's that ? That is an opportunity . ( indistinct yelling ) Whoo ! Go ! Go ! - ( mobile rings ) - oh ! Cal : You 're gonna take that ? Come on ! - I have to take this . - Okay . Okay . Great . Sarah : Hey , art . No , that 's detective bell to you . Wow . Back on the job ? Congrats . Yeah , well , two days in and i 'm already questioning it . - Hmm . - Listen , a woman came in Complaining about an incident - At a hotel last night . - Yeah ? And when i saw a photo of the suspects , I immediately took the case . Sarah , they look like that prolethean freak , mark . They both do . Cal : Okay , do it . Do it ! Nice ! - Wait , did one of them ... - Cal : Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Have a moustache and the other one have a scar ? Now , see , how do you know that ? Did they hurt the woman ? Well , i just started questioning her . But i 'm telling you , she 's freaked the hell out . Okay . You need to tell me everything you know about these guys . Listen , i got to get back inside . We 're gonna continue this conversation . Okay . All right . So , that castor clone Who was in marian 's basement , he 's gone . - He 's escaped or been released . - ( sighs ) Please , you know , can you stay ? You don 't have to go . No , i have to . They 've got helena . I 've got to try ... Yeah . You 'd really do all this for us ? Don 't freak out . Kira 's my daughter too . I 'd do anything for her . Go save your sister . Okay , i 'm back ! ( groaning ) Go . ( muffled gags ) ( stopwatch beeping ) - ( stopwatch beeps ) - now . ( gagging ) ( gasping ) Man : Go . Go again . Woman : Stop ! Stop . Stop the stress test . We 've got two more cycles to run . She 's pregnant . Bloodwork results . ( helena groans ) Woman : Ah . Just be still . You 're gonna feel the water rattle around in there for a while . Helena ? I 'm dr virginia coady . I know it doesn 't seem like it , But i 'm very happy to meet you . ( gasps ) Felix : And for the invalid , we 've got some hot tea here With just a little snip of laudanum . I 've got some sugar on the tray , But if you wanted honey , then i ... ( felix sighs ) You shouldn 't be up . Come on . Sit down . - Oh . - Are you okay ? Does it hurt ? Come on . Chin up . Sarah will come around . - ( sighs ) - she will . Do you think so ? Really ? I fear i 've lost her , felix , and my granddaughter . And i might be able to bear that if i thought i 'd ... Made them safe , but ... ( sighs ) Clearly , i have not . Okay . Okay . So do something about it . I 've done quite enough already . No . Nonsense . Hang on . Look what i 've got . - What is that ? - It 's a clean cell . For contacting your dodgy friends . For scheming and manoeuvring , Setting things in motion ... I have no use for it . Yes , you do . I 'm sorry , love , but you don 't get to sit this one out . None of us do . Get to work . - Don 't . - Why ? Are you nervous ? No , i get motion sickness . ( mumbles mockingly ) - You 're just helping me . - Stop it . Oh . Good afternoon . You 're looking well . As are your latest results . Yeah , i 'm valuable data to you . Just like sarah 's ovary . Hard science requires hard choices . You 've made them yourself in your own treatment . The difference now is We make those choices together . Okay . So ... When were you gonna tell us about the castor dude who escaped ? It was my first item of business . How 'd you find out ? I don 't think we 're sharing yet , are we ? Scott has a question for you . Er , i ... Well ... If we had the original genome , that would solve everything . So , was it really destroyed ? Or is that just another classified secret ? Believe me , i want your source material as much as you do . But thanks to the duncans , it 's lost to us . Why the duncans ? Leda started as a military experiment under their guidance . Yeah , i got that . When the military shut down the duncans , Dyad recruited them . They brought the leda genome with them . But they had sourced genetic donors for two lines , A female subject and a male . Professor duncan didn 't mention male clones . No , he didn 't . So who were these original donors ? The duncans took that to their graves . Falsified their records , hid their identities . We thought castor died on the vine . So , both the leda and castor originals are lost ? Correct . Yet another mystery . So what ? That 's it ? I just go home ? If we find them , we 'll charge them , okay ? Yeah , what if they come after me ? Look , if you see either ... Excuse me a second . Hey , you can 't show your face around here . - Are you out of your goddamn mind ? - What did you learn ? Nothing , they 're long gone . - Is that her ? - Yes . - Can i talk to her ? - Absolutely not . Abso ... Hi , i 'm detective beth childs . I 'd like to ask you a few follow-up questions . Beth , i got this . Look , i know what these guys are capable of . If you 'll just walk me through what happened . It 'll be brief . Then , when i tried to leave , rudy , if that 's even his real name , He got this look in his eye And it was like he was angry for the other one , seth , Like i had insulted them by rejecting him . I thought he was gonna kill me . Then what happened ? They went through my id . They wrote down all my information in this little notebook . And then seth yanked out a piece of my hair And put it in a bag . Like , what is that ? - Is that a trophy ? - It 's assault . Yeah , but i consented to the first guy , so that 's not rape , right ? Sarah : Sorry you had to go through that . Yeah , me too . It 's time to get you home . - Thank you for talking to me . - Thank you . You pull something like that again , You are out of my life . Look , they 've got helena , okay ? I 'm trying to figure out what these maniacs are after . I 'm just grasping at straws . She says they have the same tattoo , Left forearm , picture of a two-headed horse . Stay the hell away from here . Alison : Here he comes . Honey , it 's not too late to reconsider this . Mmm-mmm , no . No . Just follow my lead . Honey , it 's just , sometimes when you get started on something You can go a little ... Shoop . - You know what i mean ? - No . Hello , ramon . Sup ? Donnie hendrix . - Who 's this guy ? - This is my husband . He 's totally trustworthy . So , what 's this about ? We would like to buy your business . Your inventory and your client list , everything . We 'll take it off your hands And you can go off to college and make something of yourself . Oh , cool . What 're you studying , bro ? Uh ... With all due respect , What makes you think you have the stones for this line of work ? - Oh , we have the stones . - Yeah . Don 't doubt our stones . We have ample stones . You said it yourself , Most of your clients are in my circle . So what do you say ? ( breathing heavily ) Doctors are rich ... Some doctors are rich . ( grunting ) - ( mobile rings ) - ( groans ) Shit . Hey . You at your pickup location ? I 'm not going back to base . What do you mean ? We have orders . I know you 're glitching , brother . - It was the booze . I 'm fine . - Seth , i saw . How long has it been happening ? A week . Maybe two . Then there 's no choice . I 'm not gonna stand by and watch it happen , you hear ? It 's getting worse . I don 't know what to do . We 're gonna finish the job . According to the myth , castor was a warrior horseman , Bit of a badass , by the looks of it . That fits with what cal found . He says their horse tattoo is some kind of black-ops insignia . That makes sense . They 're purpose-raised , untraceable , The perfect ghost soldiers . So , why did they take the woman 's hair ? I don 't know , medical testing ? If he got a follicle , that 's like a goldmine . This doesn 't get me any closer to helena , cos . Well , there is one option , sarah , but you 're not gonna like it . I 'm not going to s . She can get you in touch with paul . Paul can piss off and take s with him . They 're the bloody problem . Which makes them our best lead . All mangoes are golden . Nothing golden is cheap . - Conclusion , all mangoes are cheap . - Voice : Did he say mangoes ? Man : Is that a sound conclusion based on those statements ? Scorpion : We like mangoes . Please concentrate . All mangoes are cheap , true or false ? Scorpion : Where are these mangoes ? Where are these mangoes ? Do i have to explain the exercise again ? I would like to see these mangoes . The doctor asked a question . I met your brother . He 's ugly . Okay , that 's enough . Scorpion : Keep provoking them and we 'll never get any mangoes . Silence , insect ! Helena , let 's walk . I will say this about the place , The air is good at night and i can smoke where i want . ( indistinct talking ) You must be very early on . A week , two ? Makes you quite a special case , doesn 't it ? As the last person who told me that . Huh . The mark-faced boys , they are your babies ? They came to me when they were very young . The irony of it ... ( chuckles ) I never wanted kids . I didn 't think it was for me . Next thing i know , i 've got more than i can count . How unpleasant . I think you should know how you got here , helena . Your family sold you out . Sarah sold you out . They decided that you were expendable . I don 't believe you . You can be sure of this ... You 're not expendable to me ... Or my boys . You 've overcome so much , your upbringing , biology , your fate . We 're gonna find out how . ( knocking on door ) Hi . - Is she here ? - Yeah . Hang on , though . She 's got three broken ribs , all right ? And i think she might be concussed Because she 's being weirdly straightforward . - So go easy on her . - Mmm-hmm . Hey , s , i need to get in touch with paul . He 's gone dark . Got what he wanted . Then we 're done . Cal 's doing you no favours pretending you can have a life here . Save it . You have to take kira away . I 'm not taking advice from somebody who sold my sister . That was my decision and i 'll live with it . But kira shouldn 't have to . I don 't know where castor comes from , What they want , who they answer to . Like you , i 'm in the dark . But you don 't fight in these conditions . You run . I know . I 've been there before . When ? In london , when you were young . The forces against us grew beyond my grasp until I did what any mother would do ... I gathered my children and i left . Bailey downs , kiss your troubles goodbye . Ramon : We 've got norco , benzo , oxy , Purple drank , you name it . Street value , 80 grand . And your cost ? Raw cost ? Twenty-five , but i have a brand . - I built up goodwill . - We 'll pay for that too . - What ? - Client list ? - All in here . - We 'll give you 32 for the works . - Whoa , whoa , honey . - Cash . Or we set up a consignment agreement so we don 't incur all of the risk . - 35 . - 32 , firm . And that 's us doing you a favour . I can live with that . I 'm just gonna talk to my business associate . Hey ! Don 't be ... What is your problem ? We don 't have anything like that kind of money . We have cash in our retirement plan , don 't we ? This is not just much-needed income , This is a constituent list . - This is about the election ? - It 's about our kids . I have just found my voter base . And i suspect they will be very loyal supporters , don 't you ? ( chuckles ) You little schemer . Let 's do this . Okay , okay . Alison : Okay . - Open her up . - Yes , ma 'am . ( dog barking in distance ) - Shh . Easy . - ( door closes ) Turn around . Hands on your head . Middle of the room . Let 's go slow . Why was sarah in marian bowles' basement yesterday ? Ask her . She wants to talk to you . She has no idea what she 's into here , cal , and neither do you . You infiltrated dyad . Did you find what you were looking for ? Or , no , no ... That 's why the tactics changed . The helena deal and the castor boys put in play . You must be real proud of the work they 're doing , paul . I am very surprised to see you settling . - I had you figured for a roamer . - Yeah ? ( chuckling ) got a file on me ? Oh , you are a person of interest In many quarters , as you well know . Come on , man . That 's what designing weapons gets you . It 's ancient history . I got out . Oh , you got rich , Then you got out . Or did sarah not know that part ? Yeah . Yeah , i 'd probably keep the secret , too . War profiteer , It doesn 't really square with this whole thing . Where 's helena ? The deal that was cut was to buy sarah time and space , - So why isn 't she taking it ? - Well , you 've met her . If she keeps coming , It 's going to end badly for everyone , I guarantee it . And you need to tell her that , cal , 'cause she won 't hear it from me . You need to get her out of here . - ( lock clicking ) - we 're gonna live with cal ? Uh , i don 't know . Maybe , when he 's set up . Why ? How do you feel about that ? I want to . Yeah , i think i want to , too . Can we sleep in the fort tonight ? Ah ! Yes ! ( chuckling ) yes . But first , you have to take a bath , yeah ? - You get the monkey into the cave . - ( chuckles ) All right . ( giggling ) ( plastic rustling ) ( mobile vibrating ) ( line ringing ) ( sighs ) ( mobile continues vibrating ) ( breathing heavily ) Monkey , it 's ready . ( tutting ) uh-oh . Monkey , where are you ? Mommy . Sarah : Let her go . Our last conversation was cut short . She 's not part of this . She 'll help us focus . ( breathing shakily ) monkey . Look at me . Don 't cry , baby . You 're gonna be okay . What do you want ? Professor duncan came to you when he resurfaced . Did he share his research ? Yes , discs and scribbles . - Do you want that ? - Tissue samples . Duncan had tissue samples of the castor original . - Kira , ask your mom where they are ? - ( whimpering ) I don 't know anything about that . Think hard , miss manning . Hey , hey , buddy , buddy , buddy , you got a couple of bucks ? - No , man . I 'm sorry . - Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey , help me out . Come on . Come on , come on , come on . Just ... Come on , help me out , huh ? Cal : All right . - Come on . - Let me see what i got . - You must be the boyfriend . - ( knife unsheathing ) - ( grunts ) - hey , i have no business with you , okay ? Just let me pass . Hey , well , you know what ? My brother 's not to be disturbed . - I can 't leave here empty-handed . - ( whimpering ) - Don 't touch her , please . - I 've got people Who count on me . You mean seth ? Some doctors are rich . What ? You look after him , don 't you ? - Protecting the brothers . - How do you know about seth ? Um , we were in turkey once ... - Uh-huh . Yeah . - And i had this dish . - It was lamb dumplings and ... - Excuse me ? - ( stutters ) and yoghurt . - All right . Sarah : Is that what this is about , Protecting your brother ? Seth : No , no . ( screaming ) no ! All fools are rich , so ... So you take ... ( grunts ) ( groaning ) - ( groaning continues ) - what 's that ? No ! Mommy . Sarah : What 's that ? Is that seth ? - That 's seth , isn 't it ? - Mommy . He 's sick , isn 't he ? They tampered with you . - Shut up ! Shut up ! - Sarah : Please . - ( sobbing ) no , no , please . - Shut up ! No , no . I don 't have the original genome . I don 't have it . Please leave my kid . - ( groaning ) - sarah : Please . - Please . - Mommy ! ( seth groaning loudly ) Put it down . Whoa ! Whoa ! - Cal : I didn 't touch him , man . - Put it down ! - ( knife clatters ) - ( rod clatters ) Easy . He just went down . I ... ( groaning ) Ahhh ! ( breathing shakily ) It 's all right . It 's all right . I 'm here , brother . Don 't hold on . Go easy . I love you . ( sighs ) So , it 's gonna be an adventure , monkey . You 're gonna see glaciers and hot springs and all kinds of neat stuff . I know it 's tough , baby , but we have to be strong . Okay . Say bye to s , yeah ? Mmm-hmm . Kira : I 'll miss you . ( exhales deeply ) Tell me i 'm doing the right thing . You are , you 're doing the right thing . Sarah : I 'll make her a target , right ? I 'm dangerous . Yes , you are . You are a good mum . Good mum . It 's time . Mmm-hmm . All right . Please take care . My people will get you out of the country . Don 't contact yours until then . Understood ? Yeah . ( sighs ) You 're a good man , cal . Thank you . She 'll be okay , i promise . Sarah : Yeah . You ? - I 'll see you . - Okay . I 'm gonna put a stop to this , and then we 'll be together , yeah ? There 's reindeer in iceland . ( sarah chuckling ) Yeah ? Did your dad tell you that ? He 's gonna be with you the whole time . Kira : I know that . I love you . ( door opening ) Okay . So , what now ? ( sniffles ) Um , now we find helena and we finish this shit . - How ? - Sarah : Castor has her . So we go to the one we know , mark . Okay ? Mark ? ( floor creaking ) - Mark , are you all right ? - Go back to sleep . What are you doing ? - ( water running ) - i 'm almost done . Go to bed . ( exhales sharply ) ( muffled groaning ) ( knock on door ) Open the door . Sarah , we need to talk . What is it you 're not telling me ? I 'm not who you think i am . Don 't worry . I can explain . We 've lost contact with mark . I need rudy back in the field . Have you two made your decision for school trustee ? Do you seriously think that people are going to trust their children To an infamous alcoholic ? ( theme music playing )

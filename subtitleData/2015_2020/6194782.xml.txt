 Previously on " Wayward Pines " ... Perimeter guard 83 . No sign of Ethan Burke . Be happy ! Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines ! Beverly Brown broke the rules . What are you talking about ? That 's why she was reckoned . We have a problem . Ethan Burke 's wife might be coming to look for him . The problem is your vehicle . It 's leaking oil . I can tighten the valve so that you don 't break down in the middle of nowhere . Where is my wife and son ? Don 't worry . I made them all better . What happened ? Were you in an accident ? That 's what the hospital told us , but we don 't ... we don 't remember . - Have you told her that I 'm here ? - No . I wouldn 't wait too long . It 's a small town . I was right . He 's with her . Go , go ! How many times do I have to tell you ? This is my town ! - You have to ask my permission - I know , - I know . - in order to leave ! - I know . - Hey ! What is wrong with this ? ! Aah ! Ethan ! I got you now , you son of a ... Unh ! You think you want to know the truth , but you don 't . It 's worse than anything you could even imagine . Ben ? Ben , Ben , Ben ? Hey , come outside . Come outside with me . It 's okay , sweetie . Come on . Yeah . Come over here . Okay , hey , hey , hey , hey . Come here . Give me your hands . Give me your hands . There 's blood . What were those things on the other side of the wall ? Wolves . This is wolf country . Here . Take this . That man almost killed us , Ethan . Well , he didn 't . We need to call the police . He was the police . Exactly . There is no covering this up . They ... they already know . There 's cameras and mikes everywhere . This house , these trees . This whole town is under surveillance . By who ? The FBI ? The ... Who ? I-I don 't know . I was sent here to investigate the disappearance of two of our agents . One of them was Bill Evans . The other one was Kate . After the accident , I woke up in that hospital just like you and Ben . I tried calling you , tried calling headquarters . Had no luck getting through to anybody on the outside . But I 've been trying to get out of this town from the moment that I woke up in that hospital . So , what do we do now ? We keep our guard up . Keep playing along . Act like there 's nothing wrong . Act like ... Act like we 're a happy family . If you want to survive . Where 's Ben ? ! Ben ? ! Ben ? ! What hap ... What is it ? ! " Dear Ben , we look forward to your first day of school at Wayward Pines Academy , 8 : 00 A.M. sharp . " Congratulations , Sheriff Burke . I got you a cake , and ... you can even eat the pinecones . - Oops . - Mr. Burke . So thrilled to have you as our new Sheriff . Mayor Brad Fisher . Say " Pines ! " Pines ! I 'm Toby . I 'm from the paper . I know it must be a fast transition . Well , I I 'd be lying if I said that I wasn 't ... a little surprised . So , want to tell me who appointed me as the Sheriff ? Was that you ? Not my purview . Well ... whose purview is it ? You see , I 'd like to , I 'd like to talk to that person . I 'd like to personally thank them for this position and ask them some questions about my new role . So I can do a good job as the new Sheriff . You know , we find it better not to ask questions and just ... go by the rules . Yeah , we don 't really like nosy nellies around here . Who wants some cake ? I 'll get a knife . Give us a minute , please . Yeah , sure . You know , personally , I 'm very happy to have a new Sheriff with your experience . What do you know about my experience ? More than most . It 's my job as Mayor . And it 's the kind of power that your new position affords , as well . I see . Well , Mr. Mayor , as the new Sheriff , I really look forward to working with you in the future . Best of luck on your first day . This is just for a few days until your dad finishes his case , all right ? Try not to draw too much attention . I never do . And be careful . Come on , guys ! Good morning , Theresa ! Ben . Up high . Down low . In the middle . Too slow . You got me . Come on , I 'm excited to introduce you to the academy . You can call me " Mrs. Fisher . " Some of the students like to call me " Mrs. F , " but that 's up to you . Now , the focus here is really on your mind , the arts , team building , and athletics . Everyone here plays a sport . Do you play a sport ? No , not really . Yeah , I had you pegged for an artist . Let me guess . Musician ? Guitar ? - Yeah . - Yes ! Well , we have a fantastic music program here . I 'll tell you something that 's so neat . A lot of the students form their own bands , and every summer , we get together for a battle of the bands at the Rosemary Cafe . That sounds neat . Okay . School day 's already begun . Okay , um , I will pick you up at 3 : 00 . Girls . I have a welcome brochure for you . - Thank you . - All right . Come with me . From New Jersey . Yeah . Do you ever want to go back ? No . I love it here . Holy crap . Good morning , Sheriff Burke . What is this ? Citizen 's arrest . You can go , boys . For what ? He 's an insurgent . He propagates propaganda . This morning , he defaced public property with subversive graffiti . There 's got to be a reckoning . A reckoning ? Let 's get something straight . Nobody 's getting reckoned here . Believe me , it 's not what we want either , but ... Peter 's given us no choice . It 's his third strike . But how would you even know about the Third-Strike Law , Sheriff ? You 've done your civic duty , Pam . You can go now . Ethan , darling ... if you don 't want to do this ... I 'd be happy to do it myself . It 's taken care of . Well ... I 'll be looking forward to how you take care of it . Honey . I 'm gonna ask you some questions , Ben . I need to get a feel of where you 're at so I know exactly where to place you . Don 't think of this as a test . Think of it as us ... getting to know each other . Okay . Great . Where are you from , Ben ? Seattle . And where do you live ? Seattle . And where is home , Ben ? Do you need me to repeat the question ? I already told you where I live . I didn 't ask you where you live . I asked , " Where is home ? " Seattle . And do you miss it , Ben ? Yeah , I guess . Why do you miss it , Ben ? I don 't know ... A lot of reasons . You miss something , and you don 't know why you miss it . Why won 't your parents take you home , Ben ? Hey , it 's my turn ! 'Cause they can 't . Why not ? Because my dad is in the Secret Service , and he 's been assigned here . What makes you so sure of that ? Because that 's what he does . What if he made it up ? He wouldn 't do that . Has your father never lied to you , Ben ? Um , he 's ... He 's lied , but ... Then how can you trust him ? How can you trust him , Ben ? _ Can I help you find something ? Yeah , I want a gift for my son . Well , what 's the occasion ? There 's no occasion . I just ... just want to get him something . H-He likes music , right ? I have , um ... these are h-hand-crafted by my husband . Each one has a different melody . This one 's my favorite . You have 30 seconds to say exactly what you need to say to me . I do not think you are in any position to be setting the rules here . 25 , and they 're not my rules . I stopped training to be an agent because the job always comes first . And I wanted to be a mother . I chose for my family to come first . But Ethan didn 't make that choice , did he ? You hurt my family , Kate . I know . I 'm sorry . A lot has changed since then . Maybe for you . For you , too . You just don 't know it yet . Would you like me to gift-wrap this ? No . No , thank you . I changed my mind . Thank you . See you guys ! It 's Ben , right ? Hi . - I 'm Amy . - Hi . Are you waiting for your mom , or ... No , I 'm ... I 'm walking home . Do you live by the woods ? Actually , I don 't really know exactly where I 'm staying . Well , do you live by the really , really tall trees or the kind-of-tall trees ? Come on , Wayward 's not that big . We 'll find it together . Come on . She was asking me a lot of questions about , like , where I live . She probably just wanted to make sure you weren 't getting homesick . Are you ? What ? Homesick ? I guess . Probably really popular at your old school . Sort of . Probably have a girlfriend , too , I 'm sure . Well , I ... I did , but , you know , right now it 's kind of like , long distance , I guess . Right . Well , guess if everything 's perfect in Seattle , it makes sense for you to want to go back . Have you ever been to that fence ? Or wall , whatever it is ? No . Why would I go there ? Do you know about those ... animals on the other side ? How do you know about them ? Ben , Ben ! What are you doing ? ! I told you I was going to pick you up at school ! It 's my fault , Mrs. Burke . I asked Ben to walk me home . He didn 't even want to , but I practically forced him . Okay , that 's all right . That 's fine . - Let 's go . - Sorry . - Bye . - Thank you ! Um , bye . That 's ... You have the wrong person . Really ? And what about these people here ? S-Standing there with you . _ It 's a long time ago , another life . How long ? I stopped keeping track after four winters passed , so probably another four , maybe five . There aren 't any calendars here . What about these numbers here ? No idea . I don 't know . Well you don 't have a cane in this picture . Rock-climbing accident . Where ? Here ? Tried to climb out . Silly me . Why can 't anybody leave this town ? There 's one way out . Hello ? Sheriff Burke , you must call a reckoning for Peter McCall tomorrow , 10 : 00 P.M. sharp . Telemarketer . How did it go ? Well they made me Sheriff today . They made you Sheriff ? I guess when you kill somebody in this town , they give you his job . Ethan ... They want to have a man executed for spray-painting graffiti . And they 're expecting me to do it , and if I don 't do it ... they 'll find someone who will . Everybody 's a prisoner here . I met the Mayor today . His name is Brad Fisher . Fisher . Fisher ... Ben ... Ben 's teacher 's name is Fisher . I met her this morning . Megan ? That 's his wife . I checked their files . Before Wayward Pines , she used to be a hypnotherapist . They made a hypnotherapist a schoolteacher . I feel like that Mayor was trying to tell me something . How do you mean ? I don 't know . I feel like we can get more out of him . - Hi . - Hey ! - Good morning . - Hey , Mrs. F. - Mrs. Burke . - Hi . I love seeing parents who are so involved in their children 's lives . Should we be expecting to see you every morning ? Well , actually , I came to see you . Yeah , can I get them to you at lunch ? I believe our husbands met yesterday ? Yes , of course . How exciting to be the wife of the Sheriff . It is . It is exciting . Um ... - Morning . - ... But you know what ? We 're new , and we don 't have any friends , and ... and we were hoping that you guys might come over for dinner tonight . We 'd love to . How nice . But you know what ? You and Ethan really should see more of the town . What do we say , the Biergarten at , 7 : 00 ? - Perfect . - Wonderful . - Good morning . - We 'll keep it intimate ... a little booth in the back , burgers and beers . You do eat meat , don 't you ? Yep , we eat everything . - I 'll see you then . - Okay . Great . Hey . Come on . Morning , Peter . Is that my last meal ? Nothing 's gonna happen to you . I 've read through this thing 10 times . I forgot how much I forgot . Why don 't you tell me what you remember ? It was 2001 , and I was in Los Angeles for a conference . I went down for a , quick drink ... at the bar . Struck up a conversation with a brunette named Denise . We really hit it off , you know ? And ... after five drinks , I asked her to come back to my hotel room , take the party up a notch . I was still married at the time . I 'd like to say that it was a ... temporary , fleeting moment of weakness , a mistake that never happened before . That 'd be a lie . Anyway ... we went back to my room ... where I blacked out . Next thing I knew , I woke up in a hotel room . Wasn 't the same hotel . The brunette from the bar ... was still there . But she was older . And her name wasn 't Denise . It was Pam . All right , let 's start where we left off yesterday . Where are you from , Ben ? Seattle . And where do you live ? I don 't know . Good , Ben . So good . Tomorrow , you can start class with the other students , and guess what ? I 'm gonna be your teacher . Close your eyes . Ready ? For your heart zone . - That 's her . - Good . Sheriff Burke , good to see you again . Mr. Mayor . Good to see you . - This is my wife , Megan . - Megan Fisher . You must be Theresa . Very nice to meet you . Pleasure to meet you . Please , sit , please . Theresa , hello again . It 's so nice to see you . Did you have any trouble finding the place ? No , no trouble at all . They sure do make a fine buffalo burger . How 's your steak ? What ? Your steak ... is it okay ? Yeah , it 's great . You all right ? Well , this is nice . I 'm glad we could do this . Please . It 's our honor to be having dinner with our new Sheriff . Yes , congratulations . Well , thank you . Thank you very much . Of course , we all will miss Sheriff Pope . He did retire so abruptly . Yeah , I think it was a ... a bit of a surprise to all of us . Yeah . You know , I always thought that being a good Sheriff was a lot like being a good schoolteacher . You need to set clear boundaries . And you need to let people know there are consequences for their behavior . Right . Yeah . I have to wash my hands . Can you show me where the bathroom is ? Will you guys excuse us ? Certainly . Follow me . Your wife 's very lovely . - Thank you . - So ... what are your impressions of our little town so far ? I-I just love it here . - Yeah . - I think it 's great ... the , mountains , the pine trees , the look of fear in everyone 's eyes . Wine ? Absolutely . Yeah . Nothing like a ... nice glass of wine to loosen up the conversation . Your son , Ben ... I hear he 's a good kid . Yeah , I think so . See , the thing about this town is that , um they focus on the children . The school ... very dedicated . It 's all about shaping the mind of the child . Your wife is a teacher at that school ? Yes . Be careful . Everyone raves about the buffalo burger , but if you ask me , the trout is sublime . Buffalo burger . So , how does everybody feel about the , public executions ? What ? You know , what Pope did to Beverly , what they 're expecting me to do to Peter McCall . The reckonings . We don 't make the laws . We ... just follow them . Couldn 't have said it better myself . Well , that 's why I write all your speeches . What an ice-cream-cone-eating bastard . He leaves without even saying goodbye ? Come on , Arlene , you got to admit he was creepy . He was so cute . Yes , well , Sheriff Pope is gone , and now we have a new Sheriff . Yippee ! I mean , a lot of people didn 't like him . They thought he was too gruff , but he was a really good man one-on-one . Honest and easy to work for . Sure . Very generous with me during the holidays especially . Arlene , I 'm sure in a very short while , you 'll feel exactly the same way about Sheriff Burke . You think ? And bear in mind , Ethan is a married man . Pam , that 's gross ! Friends ... neighbors ... let 's all raise a glass to our new Sheriff , Ethan Burke ! I 'm sure all our heads are spinning with how quickly he 's risen in the ranks . Great power ... requires great responsibility . Someone who understands ... that those who break the law need to be punished swiftly and whenever necessary , severely ... to the fullest extent of our laws ... Thank you , thank you , thank you , Pam . That was very , very kind . I just want to say that , it 's an honor to be of service . And I want everyone here tonight to know ... that as long as I 'm Sheriff of Wayward Pines , I will do everything in my power to ensure ... that the evils of this town are brought to light ... and that the true criminals are brought to justice . Hear , hear ! To Sheriff Burke . To Sheriff Burke ! Thank you . It 's that psychiatrist . Did you meet him in the hospital ? Dr. Jenkins ! Ethan . How are you ? And you must be Theresa . I 'm so glad you 've recovered . Thank you . So , what are you doing out here ? Just , checking on the progress of my latest species . She 's a crossbreed of two different pines . She doesn 't require that much attention , actually . She 's ... she 's thriving , but I ... I worry . Look , Doctor there are some people in this town that want me to execute a man for spray-painting graffiti . So the rumor is true . I 'm so sorry . We 're not gonna just go along with this , are we ? I know how you feel , Ethan . Believe me , I-I do . Perhaps the best things in this world ... require the biggest sacrifice . Look . Look at all this beauty around us . Hector Gaither . He 's on the local radio every night . Come on , let 's go . Almost all the locals tune in . When we get to the end of the road , I want you to go left , go home , and I 'll see you there in a bit . And we 're here . This is your favorite place ? No . This ... is my favorite place . Hey , tell me about your friends . I-I didn 't ... I didn 't really have any . I-I lied to you . Hey , it 's okay . We don 't really dwell on the past here in Wayward anyways . And you have me now . Time to go . 10 : 00 P.M. is really the cutoff time for a reckoning , Ethan . There 's not gonna be a reckoning . Let 's go . Where are we going ? I 'm gonna hide you , take you to the woods . They 'll find me right away . Well , that 's a chance we 're gonna have to take . We got to move . All right . Take me to the fence . " Dear Theresa , congratulations ! " A spot has just opened at Wayward Pines Realty Associates . " One of our senior realtors has chosen to retire . " Please come to the office tomorrow morning at 9 : 00 A.M. sharp . " Why did you bring me here , Peter ? " Before I built a wall , I 'd ask to know what I was walling in or walling out . " That 's Robert Frost . Which is it ? Is it keeping us in ? Or something else out ? Why don 't you tell me ? Most people want to leave when they first get here , just like you . But I didn 't . It let me be someone new , you know , forget my past . Problem is , you can 't forget forever . It 'll catch up to you . It 's caught up to me . There 's only one way out . But this is the end for me . Hey , hey , you don 't have to do this . You 're right . You do . They 're watching . You got to earn their trust . All right ? You can do this , or I can . But if you want to survive in this place , I suggest you give me a little push . Hey , Peter , I 'm not gonna do that , okay ? I 'm not gonna do that . I know you 're not . Man , come on , come on . - That 's why this town needs you . - Hey , hey , what ? ! Peter McCall 's dead . How ? Doesn 't matter . I need you to stay here , keep playing along . I 'm gonna leave . I 'm gonna go get help . Hey . You 're strong . Much stronger than you know . Well ... looks like maybe you could be Sheriff after all . I think you 're better suited for Sheriff in this town than me . That 's the smartest thing you 've said since you got here to my town . I know you let Peter McCall do your job for you . You might 've fooled everyone else , but I 'm a registered nurse . The radio 's nothing but static , except for when Hector Gaither plays piano . Did he grow up here , too ? No . He 's like 40 . What 's on the other side of the fence ?

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Wow . The Patriot ! Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D. We 're both S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . Yes . Oh , thank God . Do you know me ? I 'm sorry . That 's what the other agent told me to say . Hydra thanks you for your service . Today , for the first time , I couldn 't look my little girl in the eye . I need to make that right . I 'm here to help . This woman is not from here . She crossed over ... From the other side . Madame Hydra ? She 's ... She 's messed with his mind . Fitz would never hurt an innocent woman . [ Distorted ] No ! I guess you don 't know me at all . I don 't know . You think this sells it ? Honestly ? Feels a little fake . You 're right . It looks staged . Needs a little ... something . [ Metal creaking ] I was thinking busted headlight . You know , I admire you for volunteering for this , Coulson . We need all the fresh faces we can get for undercover work . Uh , yeah , I could do an accent or another language , maybe . My Spanish is mucho bueno . Just act natural . Just get them to stop the bus and open up . Hopefully , Skye 's on board . Well , she might be if she 's been assigned to reeducation at one of Hydra 's prison camps . But rescuing Skye is not the mission . There 's another prisoner I want to find . Does Ward know that ? Yeah . He didn 't take it well . His head hasn 't been in the game since the Doctor shot that woman . To be fair , that was rough to watch ... for all of us . That , uh , Jemma Simmons ... How well do you know her ? Well enough to know she 's on our side . You know , she claims that the Doctor isn 't evil , that he 's been brainwashed . Do you buy that ? I 've heard crazier things . Hmm . Well , crazy or not , I want to know what else she 's hiding . Burrows on radio : Squid-mobile coming your way . Here we go . Hey ! Hey ! There 's someone trapped in the car ! I need help ! Hands on your head . Down on knee , or you 'll be shot . Look , I 'm sorry . I didn 't see the car , I swear . I think she was drunk or something . She swerved right into me . ♪ [ Man grunts ] Little heads-up would be nice . Skye ? I hope not . ♪ [ Skye grunts , breathing heavily ] Fitz : Thank you , gentlemen . ♪ Why are you doing this , Fitz ? It 's Dr. Fitz . And unlike the men who just left , I know the truth about you , and your world . You mean our world ? Ah , don 't try that ploy with me . I know you replaced the real Skye . Replaced ? Is that what she told you ? Somehow you conquered Hydra in your world , and now you want to conquer ours . All I want is to get out of here . Tell me where the Patriot is . I don 't know . Did he come from your world , too ? We all did , you included . And the other subversive , Jemma Simmons ? She 's not a subversive . Where is she ? If I knew , I would tell you because if anyone could get you to wake up and realize that this nightmare isn 't real , it 's her . She loves you and you love her and she 's a real person , not a Hydra murder-bot who 's got your brain ... [ Grunts ] The carrot or the stick ? When neither motivates the truth , we face unspeakable choices . What happened to you , Fitz ? This is my home . I 'm not gonna let you destroy it . We 'll get to yours first . And when we do , the Patriot and all of his kind will pay for ever setting foot here . [ Inhales slowly , breathes shakily ] [ Sighs ] I should 've had better judgment that day . Best not to dwell on the past . What 's important is our future . No . It 's the present we need to worry about . The Inhuman threat keeps growing . The Patriot hijacked a prison transport . It 's time we take him out . I admire your resolve , Agent May . The truth is , we may have a weapon that can beat him , but there are risks involved . [ Sighs ] It 's only a risk if you have something to lose . Are you volunteering for the task ? [ Sighs ] Hail Hydra . Where did they come from ? We intercepted a bus on the way to a Hydra Enlightenment Center . Your girlfriend ... Skye ? No , thankfully . Where 's your daughter ? How is she doing ? I don 't know . She 's still rattled . She hides it , but they came into our home , you know ? Well , she 's definitely safer here than there . You both are . Look , this ... This is all new to me , but I want to help . I owe you that . You can start with the bus outside . We need to switch the plates , the digital tags , and wipe the GPS . You 're gonna put it to use ? One of our operatives got caught trying to smuggle out intel on a new Hydra weapon . They 've got him locked up at the Center . The bus is our way in . 'Nuff said . I 'm on it . You get anything more out of that woman , Miss Simmons ? [ Sighs ] Ward : No . She 's stonewalling me . [ Keypad beeps ] Not for long . Coulson : Here . Let me get you a couple blankets . Did you find Daisy ? No , just a bus full of dead bodies . [ Sighs ] Binary ones and zeroes can 't die , nor do they feel the cold . Maybe we keep that part between us . We 're wasting time . We should be focused on getting Daisy back and escaping this horrible place . Well , we can 't do that without Mace 's help , and he 's already suspicious of you . I 'm going to tell him the truth . Not a good idea right now . Trust me . Mace is risking his life going on these pointless missions . So are you . They don 't matter in the real world . If you put it like that , " the real world , " he 'll never buy it ... The Doctor , the creepy robots , the blue soap , none of it . He deserves to know . He doesn 't have fragments of memories to draw on . Neither does Ward . They 're not like me . No , no one is , unfortunately , especially not Ward . Okay , I got to ask ... What is it about that guy ? Every time I see him , I get this weird itch , like hives . Did we get along ? [ Sighs ] Well , you crushed his chest with your cybernetic arm and left him for dead on an alien planet , so no . Wh ... He 's behind me , isn 't he ? Miss Simmons , we 'd like a word . It 's " Doctor . " ♪ I was told " R " and " D " has a new weapon , something that could take down the Patriot . Ah , yes . Oh , no , it 's not exactly a weapon , but it can make you into one . [ Air hisses ] ♪ Steroids ? Oh , no , not just any steroids . Augmented strength serum ... The effects of which are very potent , although temporary . It 's not Terrigen-based , is it ? Oh , no . No , no , no . This is made from various metabolic enhancers , gorilla testosterone , even a dash of peppermint . The point is , one dose , you will have the Patriot begging for his life . ♪ Mace : " A team that trusts is a team that triumphs ? " That 's ... That 's a little cheesy . You had t-shirts made , coffee mugs . Ugh . I realize how it sounds . No one wants to hear they 're just an avatar in a digital prison , but sometimes that happens , and here we are . All that matters is getting out , and Daisy and Dr. Radcliffe are our keys to that . [ Inhales deeply ] Well , uh , think I need a drink . Ugh . - In the , uh ... - [ Refrigerator door hisses ] ... in the real world , how well do we know each other ? Are we friends ? [ Metal clanks ] More like coworkers . But I do think of you in a friendly way . Where am I from ? Excuse me ? In your world , where am I from ? Uh , I 'm not sure . - [ Cork pops ] - The midwest ? Well , am I married ? Do I have kids ? Any siblings ? Hobbies ? Do I cook ? Where are you going with this ? You don 't know me at all . Not well enough , apparently . I 'm from Brooklyn , son of a plumber , played baseball in college and guitar , can 't carry a tune . I say " soda , " not " pop , " and I like my barbecue sweet , not spicy . Never been married or had kids , but in the last five years , I 've buried 17 of my closest friends and family . Some of them died right in my arms ... ♪ ... believing they were fighting for something real , stopping hate . And you 're telling me it 's ... meaningless ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to offend . But if you don 't believe my story , you can ask Daisy once we rescue her . You don 't think I want that ? She 'd be free by now if I 'd taken the shot on the Doctor when I had the chance . There 's the Grant Ward I remember . How do you know what you believe is true ? How do you know it 's not the other way around , that you 're not the one waking up to reality ? Because it 's not possible . - Where is your proof ? - I don 't need proof . - This can 't be real . - How ? Because the man I love would never execute someone in cold blood . Fitz would never do that . He did . Ms. Simmons . I know you 've been through a lot . We all have . But what we do here matters , and you can never convince me otherwise . ♪ What do you think ? Delusional ? PTSD ? I don 't know . There might be a grain of truth to her story . Find out what that is . Fitz : Lies . That 's all she gave us . Beaten to within an inch of her life . Nevertheless , she persisted . Let 's see if she 'll open up to me . You ? Why ? You and I have different methods . It 's why we work so well together . I 'll stay , then . Actually , I heard there was an issue with Project Looking Glass . I 'd like you to check in with Security , see what happened . Of course . [ Door opens ] [ Sighs ] Hello , Daisy . You know , I asked for a mani-pedi . Got tortured instead . B.T.-dubs , your psycho-prison sucks . This isn 't a prison . All I did was fix one thing in everyone 's life ... a regret . The subsequent world is simply a consequence of your actions , algorithms running their natural course , as Dr. Radcliffe always intended . Radcliffe : [ In distance ] This isn 't what I meant , you sadistic witch ! Guard ! [ Door opens in distance ] [ Electricity zapping , Dr. Radcliffe screaming ] Dr. Radcliffe is clearly still suffering the consequences of the errors he made . If I had my powers ... I can 't give you those , but I can give you something else ... Something that will make all the pain go away . You have no idea what that even ... Lincoln Campbell . ♪ Think of it . You can live a peaceful life , have kids , grow old together with no memory of what 's happened here or there , no regrets , just each other . In exchange for ... ? Just tell me where you are in the other world , and I 'll bring Lincoln back . You can do that ? 'Cause you 're the puppet master , aren 't you , pulling all the strings . I 'm just giving people what they want . Why is that wrong ? Because sometimes what people want isn 't right for them . I can fix that . And what do you get out of all of this ? What everyone else has ... A choice . ♪ [ Door opens ] Have we I.D. ' d everyone yet ? About half . I can start notifying families as soon as ... No , I want to do that myself when we get back . Leaving in 10 . [ Indistinct conversations ] Sir , the plates are switched , the transponder 's toast . There 's no way Hydra can track the bus . Fast work . What 's with the sat-radio ? Well , I noticed the bus had a comms system , so I decrypted it and synched it up with this . So now we can listen in on Hydra 's transmissions and maybe steal some intel . [ Chuckles ] You , my friend , are gonna fit right in here . Well , I can do more . If you need a driver , I got a lead foot . I appreciate the offer , but another lead-footed soul already volunteered . I saw Mace briefly . You told him , didn 't you ? I knew I was losing him when his complexion changed from oatmeal to water chestnut . Shades of flesh color programmed into the Framework . Fitz believed even empty vessels needed variety . You mean Dr. Fitz , the guy from my history book ? Honestly , you really shouldn 't pay much attention to what 's in there . I taught it for years . It 's more fiction than fact . Hi , Dad . Did you know that those Hydra books lied to us ? Mack : [ Chuckles ] I guess you finished doing your homework , huh ? Can I go check out the old Quinjet ? Oh , come on , Sparkplug , you know you don 't need a Quinjet to fly . - [ Laughs ] - Right ? You know that , right ? Mack ? Yeah , that 's right . I 'm sorry . Have we met ? Phil Coulson . I was here when you first came in . This is Jemma Simmons . Ah , it 's good to meet you . This little girl right here , this is my daughter , Hope . It 's lovely to meet you , Hope . Nice to meet you , British lady . [ Chuckles ] And is Hope 's mother here , as well ? No , no , it 's just me and Sparkplug . Hey , you hungry ? When was the last time you had something to eat ? And candy doesn 't count . [ Chuckles ] It 's good to meet you . Excuse me . Coulson , you got a second ? ♪ Pulled this I.D. off one of the bus crew . Should get you past the gate . Ward just had to swap the photo , change the name . Jamie Flugelman ? Well , it 's the only one he could clear from Hydra 's database , so mount up , Flugelman . Fitz : How 'd the security breach come to your attention ? His co-worker spotted him hiding some contraband in his locker ... a camera . Was there any film in it ? No . No film . It was an antique , actually . Still , we shipped him off to an Enlightenment Center for a refresher course on protocols . Haven 't been down here in a while . How 's the project going ? Are you all right , son ? You look troubled . It 's ' cause I am . [ Door opens , closes ] Let me guess ... a woman . Is it that obvious ? It 's a bit early for a pint . How about a cup of tea ? Come on . Tell your old man all about it . _ - I.D. - Yeah . Flugelman ? It 's Canadian . I don 't have you on the entry logs . You coming from the Triskelion ? Yeah , and I 'm new , actually .

Just the paws . - [ Device beeps ] - Finally . You 're all set . Ah . Hail . Back at ya . [ Gate creaks ] [ Door opens , closes ] [ Grunts , tray slams ] Everything here tastes like tofu ! Put me out of my misery already ! What do you want from me ? ! You 've already taken my home , my dignity , my pride ! [ Voice breaking ] My ... . Agnes [ Crying ] [ Breathing heavily ] ♪ Are you crying ? [ Sarcastically ] No , I 'm laughing with utter joy . Yeah , well , you won 't get any sympathy from me . Sounds like you 're getting everything you deserve for creating this ... hellscape . [ Normal voice ] You can say whatever you want . Nothing hurts me anymore . Not after what he did to Agnes . What happened ? Fitz . I begged him not to , but he ... killed her right in front of me . She was all I had . How could he do that ? Because that 's who he is here . Aida changed him . She said she took away one regret . One regret can 't change an entire life . It ... It doesn 't change who you are . Of course it can . One person in your life , one decision , one sentence has the power to change you forever . One sentence ? Yeah , that 's right . One single sentence like ... " I love you , " or , " We 're having a baby , " or , uh ... " She 's gone . " I just ... I didn 't think Fitz was capable of doing something like that . [ Chuckles ] Oh , my dear . Depending on the circumstances , anyone is capable of anything . Just look around . Please tell me that you built a back door to this place and that Aida hasn 't destroyed it . I did , and she can 't . [ Sighs ] Yes . [ Sighs ] Finally , some daylight . She might have installed some safeguards . Just ... Just tell me where to go . All right . Listen carefully . My son , the Doctor himself . Stop . It means nothing . Why are you so down on yourself ? Is it something Ophelia said ? No , it 's not about her . Are you seeing someone else ? No . Are you mad ? So , what 's this about a woman ? Someone I had to kill . " Had to ? " You mean in self-defense ? No , she was unarmed . Was she an enemy of the state ? Yeah . I believe she was . So what 's the problem ? What if ... I didn 't need to kill her ? What if maybe she wasn 't lying or maybe she was ... mentally ill or something ? " What if ? Maybe . " Now , that 's your mother talking . Sorry , father . There she is again .

Not a coward , but a man of action , a great man in a hard world . And in a hard world , we cannot afford the luxury of what ? The luxury of sympathy . Exactly . We don 't buckle to guilt or womanly sentiment . Everyone needs the strap across their back now and again . Teaches respect . You know that . You 've felt it . And look where it 's gotten you . You 're protecting the human race , and the only other person who understands the weight of that is Ophelia ... Madame Hydra . And you love her , don 't you ? [ Sighs ] Honestly don 't know what kind of man I 'd be without you , father . That 's why I 'm here , son . [ Air brakes hiss ] [ Door squeaks open ] What are these ?

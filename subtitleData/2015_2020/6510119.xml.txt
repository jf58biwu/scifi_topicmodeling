 MONSTER : It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being . Ail of the events of that period appear confused and indistinct . A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me . And I saw , felt , heard and smelled at the same time . And it was indeed a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses . I remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that I was obliged to shut my eyes . Darkness then came over me and troubled me . But hardly had I felt this when by opening my eyes as I now supposed the light poured in upon me again . - ( GASPING ) - ( INSTRUMENTS BEEPING ) ( GRUNTING ) Okay . Hold on .

That its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been . She is dead , who called me into being . When I shall be no more , the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish . will no longer see the sun nor stars , or feel the winds play upon my cheeks . I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exalt in the agony of the torturing flames . The light of that conflagration will fade away . My ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds . My spirit will sleep in peace . Or if it thinks , it will not surely think thus . Farewell . lam Adam !

 Once there was a man who lived forever . He fell in love with a peasant girl . They were married . But her heart belonged to another . He gave her his title . She gave him a bastard . Look ! It 's the cuckold ! Cuckold ! Cuckold ! The pain was unbearable . He vowed never to feel such pain again . Never again . He made a promise to himself on that terrible night . A promise he has kept for over 400 years . And this is the immortal who can stop Ilaria ? This murderer ? Don 't be obtuse . I have full faith in Michael 's talent . He 's been working on a project with implications greater than even he realizes . What he 's done is remarkable . - Genius , even . - What 's the project ? A world where only one field yields a crop while the rest lie barren . - Infertility ? - That 's right . Michael has perfected it . Grafted it into apples . One dose . No side effects . Simple , elegant , guaranteed results . And the best part , it only affects mortal men . So no one else can father children except for him . And any other immortal man . With that technology , Ilaria could control the spread of mortal population . Without resorting to genocide , yes . It would solve their human problem once and for all . Where do I find this Michael ? On an island on the far end of the New World . Then that 's where I need to go . Search parties have been looking all night . So far , they 've only found four of the infected . The others are being hidden somewhere on the grounds . Have you seen my budding knife ? - No . - I keep it in the second drawer . And it 's not there . - Maybe you put it in a different drawer . - I would never do that . You know how you get when you 're working . I need to have things kept in their proper places . Agnes always ... . The lab needs to be kept organized . - I will have Landry prepare an inventory . - No , no , no . Not Landry , you . Without Agnes or Anne , I need you on top of things . Of course , Michael . Do you want the search teams to keep looking ? Well , why wouldn 't they ? I told you , the sick are being kept hidden from us . The healthy are getting scared . - People are talking about leaving . - Who ? People . Gather everyone in the dining hall . I 'm gonna make an announcement . Who 's there ? It 's Anne , Dr. Farragut . Anne ? What are you doing here ? I was framed for something I didn 't do . Framed ? By who ? I don 't know . But it won 't be long before Michael realizes his mistake . He doesn 't seem like the type who makes mistakes . This is just a detour from my path . Yeah . Nothing like a road trip through Ratville to build character . Michael needs me . When the time is right he 'll come . You look like 10 miles of bad road . Wanna tell me where you were all night ? I had a wonderful night myself . The room-to-room search was a bust . Turns out Olivia and her merry crew are better at stashing the sick than we expected . Eighty-three Mycotics , and we only found four . Looks like the sedative is wearing off . This place is about to be turned upside down . - Have you seen Sarah ? - I figured she was with you . No . I checked her room . She wasn 't there . I thought I 'd check the lab next . I 'll come with you . - They were in here . - Come on . Where are our families ? - Friends . - Please . Where are the sick ? Friends . Friends , please . - Where are the others ? - Please . Please . We tried to isolate the sick , and we failed . But we must do what we can to protect the uninfected , which is all of you . I think the doctors from the CDC would agree that this dining hall is currently the safest place in the Abbey . Good . So we are all going to stay in this room . And no one will leave until this is over . Some of us have family out there . All of us have family out there , Malcolm . - The healthy will be redirected back here . - And the sick ? What about them ? We just leave them out there to die ? Yes . Unless we all want to die along with them . It is in times of unimaginable loss that adherence to our own true path is most vital ! We can 't do that ! We trusted you ! Place guards at every entrance . Lock it down now . Sarah . You said you checked her room ? Alan , hey . You okay ? I think I know where she is . There 's a room in one of the outbuildings . I almost made it there once , but I was ambushed before I could find proof . - Proof of what ? - I came to this island for a reason . And I believe it 's buried in this Abbey . Yes . We 've been here before . Haven 't we ? Blights . Plagues . Drought . Parasites . There 's so many ways to devastate an orchard . We built this place up from nothing . Persevered through unimaginable hardships . But when a disease attacks the roots changes are necessary . Astrid , do you remember when the Spanish found us ? Your sacrifice was heroic . And your daughter , sweet Annabel . You nurtured the seeds of a generation . Alice . Without you , there 'd be no fellowship . The old ways needed to be discarded so your new ideas could come to fruition . Pruning a plant makes it grow . Thinning a crop makes it strong . Who are you talking to ? Amy . Do you have something to say to me ? Brother Malcolm . The one who attacked you . Landry had him taken down to a contemplation cell . No , no , I don 't want that . I don 't want him to be locked away . - Let him stay with the others . - But he transgressed . - You 're not concerned ? - Quite the contrary . Vigorous dissent is sometimes healthy . But you always say how one bad apple- - Now I 'm saying something different . - Is there a problem with that ? - Of course not . But why- - ? Do you see these women ? Your sisters . Each and every one of them dedicated their lives to this fellowship . They did everything that was asked of them without question , without complaint . They lived happily in the service of my will . No matter the demand . No matter the sacrifice . That proud mantle is being passed to you . Are you ready to receive it , Amy ? Are you ? Dr. Farragut ? Are you asleep ? Call me Peter . I wanted to apologize on behalf of our fellowship for the way things turned out . You came here to help us , and I 'm afraid we 've been less than forthcoming . " Less than forthcoming " ? - Are you out of your goddamn mind ? - I just thought- - Michael dumped a barrel of rats on my head . In what world do you think I would ever accept an apology from you ? - Please don 't yell at me . - I have been locked in a pit . - Please don 't . - Tortured . Starved half to death- - Stop yelling at me ! Do you have any idea how hard it is to be the sensible one all the time ? I try to do what 's right for our people and this is how I 'm thanked . I know exactly how you feel . - How could you ? - Let 's just say I face similar challenges in my line of work . Try working with your family . - I have . - It 's the worst . The absolute pits . Anne ? Are you down here ? Amy . What 's wrong ? Is Michael coming ? No . - I don 't know what to do . - How about throwing a rope ? - Tell me . - I think Michael 's going crazy . - He was talking to the portraits on the wall . - What was he saying ? Something about the crop . It didn 't make any sense . He doesn 't always make sense , but it 's your job to protect him now . To bow to his will . Do you understand ? You sound exactly like him . Maybe we could talk about this up top . - Gotta be a rope somewhere . - I 'm not leaving until Michael releases me . - Are you kidding me ? - Amy , listen to me . You will go to him and you will offer yourself . No . I don 't have to listen to you and I don 't have to listen to him . Amy , just throw down a goddamn rope . Or him either . Amy ! Amy ! I am so sorry for this . Oh , my God . You scared me . Where are your parents ? Our dad got sick . - Then he hurt our mom . - Where 's your dad now ? Lizzie ? Luke ? Hey , where are you guys ? - That 's him . - Hey , kids , come on out . We 're gonna play a little game . It 's gonna be okay . It 's okay . Lizzie ? Luke ? Come on , guys . I know you 're in there . You 're gonna be in so much trouble unless you come out right now ! Open the goddamn door ! Open the door ! He 's gone . You guys stay right here , and I 'll be back . No , don 't leave us . - I have to go and find help . - Take us with you . - I can 't . It 's not safe . - Please . Don 't leave us . Stay close to me . If you hear anything scary , you run as fast as you can , okay ? Okay . Come on . How long does the psychosis last ? Who knows ? They 're all dead within two days anyway . It 's not a very efficient pathogen . Seems to be doing a fair job kicking our ass . An infectious disease doesn 't want to kill . It wants to pass on its DNA . This one kills too quickly . Doesn 't give itself a chance to spread . I took cellular biology . You got a hypothesis to go along with that ? Yeah . I think it had help . The human kind . This is as far as I got last time . I thought one of these would work . Stand back . What the hell is this place ? Sarah was on this table . She was ... . They were performing some kind of procedure . Who ? What did they do to her ? There was so much blood . I- - I- - I- - - I don 't remember . - What the hell are we doing here ? What are you not telling me ? Ilaria are working on something big , an alternative to Narvik . You 're telling me Ilaria is responsible for Narvik ? And more . And it 's not the pathogen you 're chasing . That 's unreliable . It 's faulty . It kills too quickly . - That 's insane . - Sarah ... . Sarah 's part of it . Must be why they took her . Bullshit . Your eyes . - What ? - Nystagmus . A residual tremor . You 're sure you don 't remember anything from last night ? Just flashes . I 've seen this before . Those kids who attacked me , they had the same eye movements and no memory of it . I think they were drugged . Could have been an anticholinergic . Like scopolamine . - Okay . - Combined with morphine it creates a somnambulant state like sleepwalking . We need to find Sarah . We 'll split up , cover more ground that way . - You sure that 's a good idea ? - No . But I 'm all out of good ideas . When you fight like this , does she ever come back ? Try to make it right ? - Amy is- - - No , no . Don 't tell me . She 's following her damn path . I know you mock us . But this fellowship has thrived for nearly 400 years . Michael knows what he 's doing . I 'm the one who 's failed . You gave your life to him . Look what he 's done to you . If this is my final journey I have no one to blame but myself . Everyone you have ever known is in grave danger not to mention my team . Someone needs to talk to Michael make him see reason . Why would he listen to me ? Because you 're the sensible one . Sarah ? You in here ? I miss my mommy . Luke , Luke , Luke . It 's okay . It 's okay . No , when he gets scared , you have to tell him a story . That 's what our mom does . I mean did . Okay . Six months ago , I was in the Congo- - No , you have to say , " Once upon a time . " Okay . Once upon a time , six months ago I was in the Congo treating children a little older than you . There I met this little boy named Arthur and he was a very brave boy . He used to have a blanket that he would tie around his shoulders like a cape . I asked him one day , I said , " Why do you tie a blanket around your shoulders ? " And he said , " Because I 'm Superman , and Superman can fly . And he 'll never get sick because he can fly away from any disease . " Did Arthur get better ? Yeah , he did . He got better . Gosh , I sure did miss you guys . Run . Run . Hey , kids . - Have you found a new mommy already ? - Guys , run . Now . Sarah . You okay ? Yeah . What did you give him ? Nothing . I didn 't have a chance to inject him . Rapid fungal overgrowth . It must be the final stage of the disease . And only 36 hours after the memorial . - It kills faster than we thought . - We need to assess the mortality rate . Figure out why the boy , Soren , went into remission . Maybe something with a prepubescent immune system . Alan . He 's their father . Kids , you okay ? Why don 't you come with us ? We 'll go to the dining hall . - They 're gathering people . You 'll be safe . - Alan . I have to go to the infirmary . They have an ultrasound machine there . Michael . We need to talk . I 'm a grown woman , and I should be able to make my own choices . - Follow your own path , of course . - I don 't want to be just another portrait . Your fierce individuality has always been a source of great pride to me , Amy . Let 's cut the bullshit . Very well . You want to speak candidly ? The floor is yours . I know what you are . You 're not a god . You 're a freak of nature . And just because you had Anne and Agnes fooled doesn 't mean you get to steal my life too . My path does not lead to your side or your bed . May I be candid as well ? I know what you are too . A chip off the old block . And I know what you had Landry do with the tainted honey . I don 't know what you 're talking about- - To quote my sweet daughter , " Let 's cut the bullshit . " If it was me , why put Anne in the pit ? Oh , Anne is a sheep . Like so many of the others , she was born to follow . But you , you my dear are a genuine Machiavellian prodigy . Think I wasn 't aware of the adolescent fumblings between you and Landry ? He 's not man enough for you , of course . But then again , none of them are . I made sure of that . This crop is rotten . It needs to be plowed under . And tonight , we shall finish what you and your lover started . Thinning is a necessary part to what we do . - " Thinning " ? - Monkshood and opium poppy . A four-to-one ratio . Muscles are paralyzed , breathing stops . And death comes as a quick release . You 're going to kill them ? They 're at the end of their path . I have no choice . I 'm thinking of a pure community this time . No outsiders , just family . I ... . I don 't understand . After the first purge , your sister Annabel bore me 17 children . Alice gave me 22 after the second one . Oh , my dear , your life is about to be filled with glorious purpose . My sweet girl , you 're going to be the mother to a whole new generation . No . - I won 't do it . - Oh , of course you will . With or without your teeth . No ! No , please . Let me go . No , let go . Let me go . No ! Let me out . Let me out , Michael . Tempered glass , won 't break . I wouldn 't move around too much , Amy . Even the slightest contact with some of those plants can be extremely dangerous . Oh , Amy . I admire your fire your refusal to give in . But eventually you 'll understand just like the others . Of all my daughters you 've always been my favorite . This machine must be 40 years old . The CPU could be shot . It seems to be working just fine . But Sarah , still the fetus would be very small . You couldn 't have been more than a few days pregnant when you were- - You were made immortal . The baby shouldn 't arrest development until the fetal stages . We should be able to see something . Do you remember anything from last night ? Anything at all ? I was in the lab , and then I was attacked . It must have been a Mycotic . And the next thing I know , I was in- - I was in that horrible room . And there was blood everywhere . There 's nothing here . There 's no baby . Sarah . I don 't think that was any Mycotic attack last night . - What ? - I lost time . Just like you . I think I was- - I was drugged with scopolamine so I would forget . To make you forget what ? I 've been remembering bits and pieces all day . But I think I was the one who attacked you in the lab . - It was you ? - If it was I swear I had no idea what was happening . You attacked me ? You took it ? You took the baby ? Sarah , I swear on my life I didn 't know what was happening . Do you really hate immortals that much ? No . Is that it ? Do I disgust you ? Did this baby disgust you ? - No , that 's insane . - No . Admit it . This is what you wanted all along . You never wanted this baby in the first place . - That 's not true . - Get out , Alan . - I don 't want to look at you . - Please . Get out . Get out . Kyle . Let me out , please . - Michael 's gone crazy . - Stop the presses . He 's about to do something terrible . You have to believe me . Actually , I don 't . See , that 's the beauty of me standing here and you being locked in there . Look , you want to find Dr. Jordan , right ? - I can tell you where she is . - What do you know ? - Let me out and I 'll tell you . - Tell me and I 'll think about letting you out . Well , you know what ? I like you better under glass . What ? No , Kyle ! Please . Okay . You ready to try again ? Get back on my shoulder . Peter , is that you ? Oh , Kyle . Thank God . How did you two end up down there ? There should be a rope somewhere . - Copy that . - We need a sit-rep . What 's happening ? What isn 't happening ? There was another outbreak , 83 infected . Jesus . Quarantine was breached . Most are on the loose . - And the uninfected ? - Michael confined them to the dining hall . Have you seen Michael ? Is he all right ? He was in the botany lab arguing with Amy . Brewing up some kind of foul-smelling plant stew . Got it . Great . Throw it down . All right . Look out . What kind of plant stew ? I don 't know . Long stems , big purple flowers . Monkshood . Also known as aconitum . That 's a deadly paralytic . Why would he- - ? Hey . It 's a Thinning . A what ? It was before my time , but I heard the stories from my great-grandmother . When she was a young girl , a decision was made to thin the fellowship . To wipe the slate clean and start over . Start over how ? She 's talking about Jonestown . Solar Temple . Heaven 's Gate . Mass suicide . They 're all gonna kill themselves . Friends . Friends . Wonderful news . Wonderful news . The good doctors from the CDC have developed a serum to combat the illness which has been plaguing our fellowship . They 're administering it right now to the sick outside . And they 've even provided us with an oral vaccine so that we might not become infected either . Glorious , glorious news . I want you to take your men . I need you outside on the perimeter . - When do we get the cure ? - Now is not the time to ask me questions . Is it safe ? I thought you might ask me that . See ? Totally painless . This way . Come on . Parents , administer to your children . Men , aid our women before helping yourself . To the elderly , please offer them assistance . More than enough to go around .

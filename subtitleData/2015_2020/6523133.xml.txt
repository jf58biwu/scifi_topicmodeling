 Previously on " The Shannara Chronicles " ... ( Eventine ) The Ellcrys will bear a seed that must be carried to a place called Safehold . you must learn to control your own . ( Dagda Mor ) The Druid was a fool to send you . Aah ! Bandon ! That 's the window from the vision . This is how we find the Bloodfire . Are you sure ? Positive . Eretria ... Your body is the vessel . Your blood is the key . Don 't let them leave without you . ( growling ) Proposition ... Your help in exchange for your freedom . what does it mean ? I 've always had it . all gone . ( Allanon ) And now you are King . ( crowd ) All hail the King . Now what ? Now we find Safehold . There has to be another way across . What about that ? The yellow line . Do you see another path ? The bridge was it . I hope you 're a swimmer . We 're not going across . We 're going under . There 's a tunnel . It 's almost dusk . we 're spending the night . If there are trolls down there ... Would you rather sleep out here in the open ? That tunnel could be flooded . ( Eretria ) " Safehold . We made it . let 's go . ( panting ) She 's alive . Amberle 's alive . So what did you see ? I don 't know . I saw ruins . Like an ancient city . not Elvin . I didn 't recognize it . Was there anything else ? Think . I 'm trying . There was water . Ocean or river ? I don 't know . I need a break . the Ellcrys is almost bare . If the last leaf falls ... I know what happens ! it 's because I am trying to prepare you for what is to come . You must fortify yourself against the Dagda Mor . You 're pushing to see if I snap . It 's not fun ... is it ? but be careful how you use it . And with whom . ♪ I feel it running through my veins ♪ ♪ And I need that fire ♪ ♪ Just to know that I 'm awake ♪ ♪ It all looks the same . What do you think ? I 'll head down here . You guys check that way . Double back in five minutes ? Yeah . go for its eyes . It 's their weak spot . Thanks . I should go with you . I 'll be fine . Elfstones won 't work against Trolls anyway . And killing them isn 't exactly your strong suit . I think I liked it better when you two weren 't friends . not a second later . You said you were stepping down . You made a fool of me . Councilwoman . I have seen the evil that 's coming . I need you at my side . Your influence over the council would bring unity when we need it most . Kael . You 're no king . You 're what 's left . That went well . What did you expect ? I was hoping she 'd be reasonable . She believes her cause to be just . her judgment is clouded by ambition . Sounds like I should be worried . The wiser king always is . ( distant grunting ) ( snoring ) I said some things back at Utopia . and I 'm sorry about all of it . Don 't be . I was a fool . you weren 't . It 's okay to want to belong . I 've spent my whole life as an outcast . I know how it feels . I just wanted to believe that there was a place for me . But Tye turned out to be a liar . he saved me . The guy I spent my entire life running away from . It doesn 't make any sense . my dad would come home from the tavern drunk . My mom wouldn 't let him in . yelling and banging on the door until he passed out . I was embarrassed of him . Then I find out he 's this hero . That he destroyed himself with magic to save us all . people are complicated . You can 't beat yourself up over it . But at least you know the truth now . You know where you come from . All I have are questions . you gotta see this . ( snoring ) They 're asleep . No way . Is that ... My tattoo . What 's your tattoo doing on a wall beneath the ruins of a human city ? That tunnel must lead to the Bloodfire . I agree . It ... it can 't be a coincidence . but there are three heavily-armed trolls in that room ... How are we supposed to get past them ? We 've fought worse . Wait . Maybe there 's another way . ( snorts ) ( snorts ) ( grunts ) it could turn the tide of war . Have you told the Council ? No one knows but the two of you . the Council won 't trust me . We must tread carefully . There are forces aligning against the king . Kael intends to take the throne . we need to stop talking to protect Ander . Wouldn 't do any good . Kael is a symptom . The disease is a lack of confidence . the Council won 't let me sit on it . Are you suggesting we let a coup happen ? Kael Pindanon would not dare harm the son of King Eventine . How do you know that ? Because there is still honor within these walls . This letter bears my seal . I need you to deliver it to bring back the support I need to win over the Council . I 'm not leaving you . This is my best chance to gain the Council 's trust . They need to see me as a leader . please . You 're the only one I can count on . Take it to Slanter . This is it . Ha ! They 've been at it for hours . Hope they can still hold their swords when the real fighting begins . you should try spending a whole day with the Druid . Keep your shield hand high . You 'll absorb the impact with your whole body . Our enemy is aggressive . Utterly lacking in fear . but they will be reckless . We must be the opposite . Help me demonstrate . Um ... I 'm not much of a fighter . We 're all fighters in this war . ( Dagda Mor ) Show him your power . Do it . Be patient . Wait for an opening . You are strong . Take your chance . He is weak . He 's weak . You 're stronger than you look . He 's no king . Kill him now ... Finish him ! Slit his throat ! Kill him . Do it . Kill him . Aah ! ( man ) Protect the king ! ( man ) Restrain him ! Put down the sword . ( Dagda Mor ) No ... ( man ) all right ? ( groaning ) ( man ) Hold him . What did you see ? I don 't know . I 'm ... I 'm not sure . The boy is not himself . Let me speak with him . See that you do . Release him . ( Amberle ) Looks like someone was just here . ( Wil ) What is this place ? I feel like I 've been here before . How could that be ? I can 't explain it . What is " Filii " and " Apocalypsi " ? No idea . do you recognize this language ? ( fading ) Eretria ? Your body is the vessel . Your blood is the key . ( gasping ) You okay ? I think so . ( panting ) I heard a voice . It said my blood is the key . What does that mean ? I don 't know . But I saw a place ... like a temple . And that symbol was there . like the sun . you saw the Bloodfire . Sounds exactly like what I saw in my vision . Aah ! I know how to get to the Bloodfire . We 're close . How do you know that ? And what happened to you back there ? I don 't know how to explain it . It 's like I can feel the map in my blood . Like it 's a part of me . That 's the reason you were in my vision . Why the Ellcrys wanted you here . I thought it was to make sure you didn 't get yourself killed . why not ? So is this what it feels like when you use your Elfstones ? What do you mean ? I feel invincible . I usually feel like I 've been set on fire so ... no . This should be it . Nothing ominous about that . I feel like a pawn in a game I don 't understand . it 's like I can ... feel him . Who ? The Dagda Mor . Its like he 's inside my head . Making me do things . okay ? And you 'll win . What about what I want ? What do you want ? ( gasping ) What is it ? What 's wrong ? nothing . I just ... I 'm sorry . I 'm just ... I 'm just exhausted . Maybe you should get some rest . You 're not getting away that easy . You 're not getting away at all . Oh ... Bandon ... you 're hurting me ... stop ... ( roaring ) Catania ! ( Amberle ) We made it . Okay ... so where is the Bloodfire ? It 's here ... I can feel it . you guys were standing beneath the window . Wil on the left . ( Wil ) And ... nothing . I take that back . ( Wil ) I guess this means we 're in the right place . Now what ? I don 't know . But we need to figure it out . no one leaves ... do you hear that ? ( screeching ) No one enters . No one leaves . ( Eretria ) Who are you ? ( both ) Guardians of the Bloodfire . Who among you ... Dares to seek ... ( both ) the Bloodfire ? I do . Amberle Elessedil of Arborlon . Mmmm ... Eles ... sedll . The Fire has power beyond your wildest imagining . Death comes to those unfit to bathe in its essence . ( both ) What makes you think you 're worthy ? I was chosen . ( Wil ) What are they telling you ? Princess . Is it because you fear the Fire ? Or because the Halfling still smells of her bed ? Can you feel it ? a strong magic ... For such weak shoulders . Halfling . You can 't protect yourself . Your mother . Dead . Your father . Dead . Your heart . Undecided . they 're trying to confuse us . Turn us against each other ... half-Elf . Which one will it be ? If we place more company to the north ... What is this ? I didn 't call a meeting . Nothing you need worry about . I know what you 're doing . And you won 't get away with it . It 's already been done . the Blackwatch have fallen in line . I have assurances the Council will ratify my ascension by nightfall . What you 're doing is treason . Take him . Hello ? Show yourself ! Commander . How did you know where to find us ? The King sent me . What does Eventine know of our plans ? Eventine 's dead . Arion too . King Ander sent me to deliver this to you . He 's assumed the throne . it seems . I 've convinced the other tribes to fight the Demons . I wasn 't expecting an Elvin civil war . No one was . Now ... will you help us ? The Princess saves the world . The Princess gets the boy . The Princess gets everything . Happily ever after ! They don 't trust you . They pity you . Like a stray dog . All alone and ... Unwanted . You don 't get to have it all . Eretria . What are you doing ? Put the knife down . Don 't let them get to you . I gave up my freedom . You ? You haven 't given up anything . All you do is take . and you suck the world dry . don 't you see what 's happening ? They 're messing with your minds . You spoiled bitch . You 'd be dead if it wasn 't for me ! And you 'd be rotting in the bowels of a Fury ! No ! No ! Aah ! I 'm sorry . Now you know the truth . It 's you or them . ( both ) Make your choice . Eretria . Your hand . What 's happening to me ? She is a child ... Of the Armageddon . My body is the vessel ... My blood is the key . Aah ! ( thundering ) ( Bandon ) Where is Catania ? She is safe . And that is all you need to know . You took her away . Why ? you must let her go . ( Dagda Mor ) He 's lying to you . ( groaning ) You had no right ! and your feelings for the girl have made you vulnerable . ( groaning ) No . I can fight him . Kill him . He 's lying to you . You must fortify yourself . ( groaning ) Fortify yourself . ( growling ) You talk about my gift . and then you use me and toss me aside . You sent me to that thing . To my imprisonment . but you ... you have taken everything else . I have done for the safety of the Four Lands ... and to protect you . You 're nothing but an outcast from an Order of dead men . Maybe it 's time you joined them . Bandon . this is me . Stronger than anyone could ever imagine . even . ( screaming ) I am sorry . For everything I have done . And all that is yet to come . Who 's there ? Thank you . I 'm sorry about your kin . But I believe you are the ruler the Four Lands needs . I hope you 're right . How many are with you ? 000 . In the caves beyond the city . It 's quite a sight . My men await your orders . King . We move tonight . Gather your men . It 's the Bloodfire . I need to get inside ! We will not let you steal the power of the Bloodfire ! She 's the one ! Kill the bearer of the seed ! Run for the flame . I 'll cover you . Now go ! ( witch ) Don 't let her get away ! Hey ! Hey ! Crazy ladies ! ( Wil screaming ) ( screaming ) ( Wil ) Now go ! Go ! ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( Wil ) Amberle ! We must fortify the palace and prepare for a siege . And the Sanctuary ? The Ellcrys is beyond saving . ( Ander ) You 're wrong . The Ellcrys is this city 's only chance . ( soldier ) What are those creatures doing here ? to fight the Demons as our allies . They 've pledged an oath to the King . The true King . The Gnomes are not our enemy . The Dagda Mor is . And he will not cease until every race of the Four Lands is destroyed . We don 't need to face this alone . we can protect the Sanctuary until Amberle returns ... Madness ! The Princess is likely dead already . She lives . we shall restore the Forbidding . That is the only way to win this war . Your Grace . Your Grace . King Ander . King Ander . we fall together . Amberle ? Amberle ! we have to get her out of there ! Eretria ? Come on . come on . wake up . No . ( roaring ) ( roaring ) on " The Shannara Chronicles . don 't do this to me . too . ( Ander ) The Demons outnumber us a thousand to one ... We cannot beat them which means restoring the Ellcrys is our only hope . I promise . let us fall so the Ellcrys may rise again !

 [ grunting ] Is he okay ? Sometimes , the healing process can cause involuntary brain wave reactions . He looks like he 's having a bad dream . He just got blasted by a space witch and mauled by giant lizards . What dream could be worse than that ? [ Shiro grunting ] No , no ! No . You took my hand . What more do you want ? [ groaning ] Stop ! I want him awake enough to feel this . [ grunting ] [ groans ] Listen to me . We don 't have much time . [ Shiro groaning ] [ grunts ] Wake up ! Zarkon has located the Blue Lion of Voltron on your planet , Earth . You must get it before he does . What are you doing ? I 've planted a bomb to cover your escape . Get to a pod , now . - Who are you ? - I am Ulaz . Now , come on ! Zarkon will know that I released you , so I must disappear . But , if you survive , go to the coordinates in your arm . - The Blade of Marmora is with you . - Why are you helping me ? As a fighter and a leader , you give hope . Hurry ! Earth needs you . We all do . [ breathing heavily ] - [ footsteps approaching ] - [ gasps ] [ screams ] [ moaning ] [ sighs ] You know I 'm innocent ! I would never betray Zarkon ! You 're weakening the empire ! You misunderstand . I 'm giving you the opportunity to serve the empire . You will have the honor of personally bringing down Voltron . [ screaming ] I 'm not finding any coordinates in here . Are you sure this wasn 't just a dream ? I 'm positive . Someone helped me escape . - And he was Galra ? - Yes . - You know you cannot trust them . - Your father must have trusted them once . Zarkon was the original Black Paladin , wasn 't he ? - That was a long time ago . - Wait , what ? Didn 't you see how he stole the Black Lion right out from Shiro ? Or that he could do all that cool stuff with his bayard ? Shiro 's bayard ? You know , the black one ? [ Shiro ] Why didn 't you just tell us the truth about Zarkon ? I wanted to protect you from the dark history of the paladins so that you would have a chance to bond with your lions on your own . You are the Black Paladin now , not Zarkon . Yeah , well , the Black Lion may have a different take on the matter . [ Pidge ] Wait a second . I think I see it now . Some repeating numbers in all this Galra code . Let me extract it . They are coordinates ! They lead here : the Thaldycon system . - Then , that 's where we 're headed . - Shiro , are you sure you can trust this ? I mean , after all the Galra have done to you- - They- - They took your arm . It 's worth the risk . Someone helped me escape . If we can locate some allies in our fight against Zarkon , especially ones from his own side , we might just find a way to take him down . We can check the location , but I do not like this . The Galra are not to be trusted . [ Coran ] Well , this is it . No sign of any activity at all , living or otherwise . [ Shiro ] Can we get in there to take a closer look ? [ Coran ] I don 't want to bring the Castle any closer . Those xanthorium chunks contain highly unstable nitrate salts . Even bumping one of them can blow us straight to Wozblay . Are you sure this is right ? These are the coordinates Number Five gave me . - Hey ! My decryption is solid . - There must be something we 're missing . We should get out of here . We 've checked it out , but now , it 's time to move on . No . There must be something more to this . I can feel it . I think we should wait . Sire , Prorok 's transformation is complete . We only need to know where to send him . Now , reach out with your mind ! [ groans ] I have the coordinates to launch the beast . [ alarm blaring ] There 's an intruder in the Castle ! How could someone just sneak aboard the ship ? I knew coming here was a mistake ! - There he is . Level five . - Everyone , suit up . [ panting ] I got him . [ Shiro ] Keep eyes on him , Lance . We 're all headed toward you . Hold it right there ! [ Coran ] Careful , he 's faster than an angry klanmüirl ! But he can jump like a sprightly globinheffer ! Coran , you 're not helping ! Somebody 's as mad as a wet chüper . Coming your way , Number Five ! I got him ! I don 't got him ! - He 's dragging Pidge away ! - Come back here ! Huh ? - [ grunting ] Hunk ! - Huh ? Sorry ! - Oh , Hunk failed the team , guys . - Hey ! - All right , it 's up to Keith now . - Copy that . I 'm ready . Ooh , this is exciting ! He 's got a sword . One young paladin , one seemingly indestructible foe ... [ Pidge screaming ] [ screaming continues ] Swing and a miss ! Oh , another swing and a miss ! He can 't touch him ! He 's too fast ! [ grunting ] [ grunting ] He knocked his bayard out of his hands ! It 's on the ground ! - [ grunting ] - [ screaming ] [ both groan ] [ all grunt ] Ulaz ? - [ grunts ] - Who are you ? Stop ! It 's him ! This is the Galra who set me free . You 've come . [ Shiro ] I don 't think this is necessary . I will not have some quiznak-ing Galra soldier on the bridge of my ship ! If I wanted to kill you , you 'd be dead already . Are your Galra threats supposed to win my trust ? I 'm not trying to win your trust . I 'm trying to win a war . And , because of Shiro , we are closer than we 've ever been . Our gamble on you paid off better than we could have ever imagined . When you released me , you also mentioned that there were others working with you . Yes . We are called the Blade of Marmora . Uh , others ? Are they here ? Hunk , can you try not to act so scared around the chained-up prisoner ? It makes us seem a little lame . - I am alone on this base . - What is this base you 're talking about ? Shiro 's coordinates just led us to this wasteland . The base is hidden . Now that I know it is Shiro that has come , you are welcome to our outpost . - It lies dead ahead . - Behind all the xanthorium clusters ? No . Right in front of it , in a hidden pocket of space-time . Coran , are you hearing this ? I am picking up some kind of anomaly on the screen . I suppose it could be a cloaked base . Just fly straight for the center of the xanthorium cluster . You will see . You think you 're going to get me to destroy our ship just because you say so ? We came out here to find some answers . Are we going to turn back now ? You know I trust you , Shiro , but this doesn 't feel right . And you know I hate to agree with Keith , but it 's a big fat ditto for me . Galra could have implanted fake memories of the escape in your head . Oh , come on , that would be so evil , which , of course , they are . But they 'd have to come up with some molecular level storage unit , which his hand does have . But , to be linked up to memory , it would need a direct pathway to his brain , which ... yeah . Ulaz freed me . Without him , we wouldn 't be here . Fine . Slow and steady , Coran . Head for the xanthorium cluster . Yes , Princess . Beginning approach . - [ alarm blaring ] - Impact imminent in five , four ... three , two ... Well , that 's something . - [ Allura ] What is it ? - Putting it up on the screens . Amazing . They 're folding space . It 's like a space taco . Or a space calzone . Or a space-time soup dumpling and we 're the soup . Hey , is there a cafeteria on this thing ? [ Ulaz ] Welcome to the Blade of Marmora Communications Base Thaldycon . Now , if you 'll free me , I need to send a message to the leadership . They need to know I 've made contact with Voltron . Go with him and keep an eye on him . - I 'm staying here . - Ooh ! Can we go ? I want to see how they make the space pocket ! You guys go ahead . I 'll hang back and protect the princess . Ugh ... [ Ulaz ] This is the gravity generator that creates the space-time fold that hides the station . It was created by a reclusive genius engineer named Slav . His technology allows the Blade of Marmora to remain hidden while we work to take down the Galra Empire . Zarkon would do anything to get his hands on this technology . There are Galra out there that aren 't loyal to Zarkon ? [ Ulaz ] We thought expanding the Galra Empire would bring stability . We learned too late , a tyrant doesn 't seek stability , only power . With our members working on the inside , planning coordinated attacks with Voltron , we may finally have a chance . So , you have agents working within Zarkon 's ranks ? How do you think you got away from Zarkon in that last fight ? Do you think those shields around Zarkon 's command center went down on their own ? We 've got people risking their lives in this war , just like you . If you have people on the inside , can they tell me where my family is ? - They were taken the same time Shiro was . - I knew others from Earth were captured . I never saw them , but I have some records of Galra prisoners here . I can transmit them to your ship . What 's that weapon you carry ? It 's a ceremonial blade that each member of our order carries . Hmm , nice . - [ alarm blaring ] - Huh ? [ Ulaz ] Oh , no ! You were tracked ! What ? Us ? If Zarkon knows we 're here , it 's because you ratted us out . It 's another one of Zarkon 's robot ... beast ... ro-beasts ! - We have to get back to the ship . - Shiro , wait . These are instructions on how to reach the Blade of Marmora headquarters . Before you go there , find out how Zarkon is tracking you . If you lead him there , our entire underground network , everything we 've spent centuries building , will be lost . I knew he cannot be trusted ! - It wasn 't him . - How can you be sure ? It doesn 't matter now . What should we do ? Why can 't we hide here in the space clam and wait for it to go away ? Everyone get to your lions , but don 't launch . We 'll wait to see what it does . I don 't want to risk fighting it if we don 't have to . [ Pidge ] We should be safe as long as we 're hidden in the space pocket . He 's drawing in the xanthorium clusters . [ rapid beeping ] I think he knows we 're here . Hold ... [ Coran ] Direct hit ! He definitely knows we 're here ! Get the particle barrier up ! [ Coran ] He 's readying another attack ! [ Allura ] He 's pulling us in as well ! Paladins , I think it 's time to launch ! Form Voltron ! [ Allura ] We 're exposed ! The space fold has been lowered ! [ Coran ] Well , there goes Ulaz . I knew we should never trust a Galra ! [ Shiro ] Let 's light this thing up . Fire lasers ! - Huh ? - Huh ? [ Pidge ] He 's pulling in more ammo ! [ Shiro ] Move , move , move ! [ all yelling ] [ Shiro ] Lance , Hunk , give me full reverse boosters ! This thing wants to eat us like we 're a space taco ! [ Shiro ] Can 't get free ! I 'll make him back off ! [ Shiro ] We 've got to keep some distance between us and that ro-beast ! [ Hunk ] It 's trying to pull us in again ! I 'm burning thrusters at full capacity and it 's not making any difference ! [ all grunt ] - Is everyone all right ? - Alive , yes . All right , no . It 's going for the Castle ! We need some way to stop its tractor beam ! I 've got an idea . Pidge , form shield ! We can use the shield to block the beam ! - We stopped the beam . Now , what ? - Now , we go on the offensive . The xanthorium clusters ! We can use them ! [ all yelling ] [ Pidge ] The shield can 't handle this much power ! We might not be strong enough to beat this thing ! - [ Ulaz ] Hang on ! - Ulaz ? I 'm going to take it down from the inside ! [ Shiro ] Ulaz , no ! Let us handle this ! Voltron is too valuable . The universe needs you . [ all gasp ] [ Shiro ] Get ready ! [ Pidge ] Ulaz opened up the space pocket from inside ! It 's falling in on itself ! - He did it ! - Ulaz saved us . He 's ... gone . Sorry we doubted Ulaz , Shiro . He saved all our lives . I still have so many questions . [ doors opening ] Do you think Zarkon is really tracking us ? We cannot know for sure . Only Ulaz knew our whereabouts . You don 't really think Ulaz gave us up ? After he sacrificed himself ? Yeah ! Maybe Zarkon found out about this place on his own . He 's probably been searching for the Blade of Marmora . It 's clear the loss of Ulaz has caused you great concern , but , regardless of how Zarkon located us , we cannot stay here any longer . It isn 't safe . We should meet up with the rest of Ulaz 's group , finish what we started . No . We 're not going to the headquarters until we figure out how Zarkon found us . We can 't risk losing the only allies we have in this war .

 Cosima : I was , like , way above , and then I came back . Delphine : Her name is Krystal Goderitch . We intercepted them as they were forcing her into the trunk of a car . You 're sterilizing women . Sarah : You 've done something to me ! Paul : You gave her the Castor pathogen , didn 't you ? You 're somehow able to fight it off . It 's a weapon . Coady : The science in this room could rewrite the very nature of humankind . Run ! A vote for Alison Hendrix is a vote for change . - Alison : Jason kissed me ? - Cosima : Yeah , he just came out of nowhere and did it . Connie : I signed . Bubbles is yours . My father ... Our secret I ... language . I have a pretty serious health issue . Shay : Oh , my god . Oh , sh ... - Scott : What does it say ? - I 'll only tell Sarah . Krystal : So this guy , he had , like , a wicked scar , which I was into , for some reason . It was kind of dark and mysterious and my relationship with Hector was open , so , I thought , whatever , like , this guy 's hot . Nobody dies . I was , like , so wrong . That 's terrible . Yeah , I know . Anyway , so , we get to the room , and then suddenly I realize there 's another guy in the room who looks identical to him . Like , identical . An identical twin . [ Chuckles ] I know , right ? Twins are so creepy . - Mm . - Yeah ! They are , right ? So , anyway , if hotel security hadn 't shown up , I would have been thrown in the back of a van . Like , legitimately . But they didn 't have to kill Hector , you know ? Anyway . So you 're a doctor ? Yes , I have a ... - Wow . - Family practice , yeah . Oh , wow ! I really relate to that , you know ? Just the healing arts . I feel like what I do is quite healing . I don 't know if you feel that way , you know ? Yeah . But that 's just my gift , and I just feel like , you know , in spite of everything , as hard as it is losing Hector , you can 't crush the human spirit . ♪ But it 's always been you ♪ Gracias . Twins . Blonde and brunette . They come through here ? No hablo inglés . Hermanas , and yeah , you do . I don 't remember any sisters . To Castor . Decades of work incinerated in half a second . You 're lucky to be alive , Doctor . Without the original genome , the few boys I have left will be dead within a year . Two if we 're lucky . Where 's Rudy ? In the field . Why ? I have a source . Inside Leda . But I need something from you . Inside Leda ? How the hell did you manage that ? Castor and Leda . I 've been feeling this for a while . It 's not just two factions , is it ? Who 's in charge , David ? Keep your boys alive , Doctor , and we can all get what we want . Nealon : You satisfied ? Yes . In fact , it 's the ... the best manicure I 've ever had . And she 's rationalized her brush with Castor . Krystal Goderitch is ... still naive . Very . Not one to pierce the veil , is she ? No . And where are you with her new monitor ? Uh , there are three candidates vying . We 'll see which one she picks . Good . You and I have a ... problem closer to home . How 's Rachel progressing ? Well , her mobility is not looking good , but her aphasia 's improving , and she still has value . Does she ? All I know is that she 's a liability . We can 't keep her around indefinitely . I 'm fine , Sarah . It was scary and gross , yes , but not a major episode . [ Sigh ] I 'm just worried about you . I am not the patient here , okay ? You 're the one who 's been through hell . Well , Coady seemed to know that I was gonna beat that pathogen . Maybe she suspected that you were functionally immune . It 's a ... it 's a prion disease , like mad cow , a twisted protein that misfolds other proteins , but y ... you don 't have the protein that it corrupts . So use me , then . As ... as treatment for your relapse . Well , that 's not ... that 's not really how it works . And anyway , it 's not a relapse , okay ? It 's ... it 's a trend , it 's totally ... plottable and expected . Delphine has teams that are working on gene therapy . We 'll know something soon . Where are you ? Oh , a ... friend 's . Oh ? Seriously ? Who ? Do I have to answer to you , as well ? No , of course not . Is it good ? Yes . Yeah , it 's what I need right now . Hey , what about you ? Let 's talk about what you need . I need a way forward . I feel like we 've been on our back foot against everybody , and I 'm sick of it . And I keep thinking ... What ? I keep thinking about Beth . Finishing what she started . Yeah . It 's a lot . I think about her , too . I just can 't lose another one of us . Hey ! Hey , look at me . You haven 't lost anyone yet . I gotta go . Um , but if you do want a way forward , Sarah , just call Scott . We 've been holding back something really big . Okay ? Bye . - Hey . - Hi . Donnie : We 're not taking in Helena , too , all right ? We already hired the Amish girl . She 's prolethean , and she and Helena are a package deal . Helena just got out of a rendition prison , Donnie . We need to play our part . Alison ? She 's crazy-pants . Yeah , but she 's good with kids . She just needs a bit of socializing and to be taught a couple of life skills . You could say that again . Gemma : Do you like pink or purple , Helena ? [ Sniffs ] This is very soft , pleminnytsya . What 's that thing ? This ? This is a secret . These are my babies . I kept them at Uncle Felix 's to keep them safe . You 're silly . [ Laughs ] [ Laughing ] Why doesn 't anyone listen to me ? - What ? - We are selling soap with Helena . She 's going to help us make it . That is it . That doesn 't answer my question , Alison . Why nobody listens to you ? No ... no . Why doesn 't the psycho go live with one of her other sisters ? Because it 's your turn , and if you don 't do it , then I 'm going to tell everyone that you 're awash in pills and you 're in bed with the Portuguese mob . Alison : There 's no need to blackmail , Felix . Yes ! Yes , blackmail ! - I 'm not on board with assassin boarders . - Gemma : Mom ! Thank you , Sestra Alison . Oh ! Such beautiful clothes . See ? She fits right in . Looks good , doesn 't she , Donnie ? Uh ... Yeah . One more time . In ... [ Coughing ] Sorry . Corpse pose . Hmm . Hey . You know anything about near-death experiences ? Why , have you had one ? I had something . Well , I have a theory . Before we leave this life , we ... see what we love . I mean , like , pit of the soul , " can 't live without it " love . And if it 's strong enough ... sometimes we find our way back . Are you done corpsing out ? 'Cause you 're already late for work . [ Laughs ] Give you a ride in the bug . I should show you the secret lab . Can I meet the genetic mutants ? Yeah , but you won 't survive it . - Oh , no ! - Hmm . Sarah : Well , he gave that to Kira . Whatever it says , Duncan wanted us to have it . And only Rachel can read it ? And she won 't , until she talks to you . [ Sighs ] She talks now , does she ? Delphine doesn 't know anything about this ? Cosima doesn 't trust her , but I don 't know . It 's all drama with those two . Maybe we should trust her . No , no , no , no . She might give it to Topside . If this is Duncan 's key to everything , to your synthetic sequences or whatever , then they could use it to restart the human cloning , right ? So we need to know what it says , and then we can decide . [ Sighs ] Which means I have to talk to bloody Rachel . You 're improving . How unfortunate . Yeah , she 's already got a house goat and milking stool . I didn 't mean that . I 'm a threat ... to her . And how did you deal with threats , Rachel , when you were in my position ? Rachel : Ready . [ Sighs ] Looking good , Rachel . New ... accessories . What ... what 's this book say , then ? My ... my book . Siobhan : But your father didn 't leave it for you , did he ? He killed himself instead and left it for Kira . So we would cooperate . Scott : She thinks Delphine is going to eliminate her . I translate ... Book . My ... my book , and you ... Take me out of here . She wants a quiet life ... in Taiwan . You can 't disappear twice , can you ? Dead women don 't pass customs . Krystal Goderitch . Scott : Who 's that ? [ Sighs ] She 's Leda , isn 't she , Rachel ? The one that Castor was after . Rachel : Yes . Her monitor is ... Dead ? Get me I.D. Sorry , you want me to steal Krystal 's identity and get you out of Dyad ? Yes . How do I know you can even read that book ? She 's translated the page I gave her . What 's it say , then ? Are we in it ? No , it 's a ... Nursery rhyme ? " In London town we all fell down " ... And Castor woke from slumber . Castor . We need to know what 's inside that book . That 's the end of it . Hello . Oh , hello , luv . Will you , um , grab your things and we 'll head over to the Hendrix 's ? All right ? You want to free Rachel over a nursery rhyme , coded in " Dr. Moreau , " about Castor . That 's one page of it , S. There 's gotta be something about us in there , and it could save Cosima . Or Duncan could be off his rocker , or Rachel could be full of shite . There 's only one way to know . Felix : Scott says he and Cosima can get Rachel out of Dyad . How ? Something to do with his gaming group . I don 't know , it 's ... Sarah : Okay , good , so Krystal is 350 kilometers away . We leave right now and we can be back by tonight . Whoa ! Did I just get seconded into this shit ? Siobhan : If you spring Rachel from Dyad , you will destroy this alliance with Delphine . She 's the only person standing between you and Topside . I don 't give a shit if Delphine 's pissed off . We 'll know what it says , and she 'll have to work with us . Right ? Give him the keys . The book might only be about Castor . Why bring it into play ? The Castor boys are mayflies . I 'm not gonna sit on my hands and wait for them to die , S. Gracie : Is Mark a mayfly , too ? Sorry , Gracie . But for what it 's worth , he was different from the rest of them . Siobhan : I 'll , um ... I 'll walk you to the bus , luv . Felix : If we 're gonna go road tripping to steal some poor clone 's identity , then I 've only got one demand . I get to choose the music . Cosima : Chill zone , over here . Um , protein modelling server over there , as I 'm sure you 're aware . Uh , fumigation hood , for ... A little of that . - Oh , and Scott . - Hi . Hi , Scott . He ... he loves lesbians . Shay : Oh , he does ? Well , I ... can I sequence your genome ? Uh ... thank you . Um , but I draw the line at sharing that information with a corporation . Smart . Seriously , right ? Scott : You got my text ? Yeah . And if Sarah 's ready , then I 'm ready . Dude , you rock " Rune Wars " ? I play this game with my brothers all the time . - Really ? - Yeah . Cosima shreds at it . I 've got a gaming group . Bit of a sausage-fest , but maybe you 'd like to ... Oh , wow . " Dr. Moreau . " I love this book . Sorry , um ... Scott 's really anal about his stuff . - Okay , sorry . - Sorry . Delphine : Hello again , Shay . I got her a visitor 's pass , so ... Cosima was just showing me around . It 's fine . Um ... But I need to speak with you . Okay . - I 'll go , babe . - No , no no no . No . Stay . You don 't have to go . It 's all good . All right , then . This is about the sequencing issue we have with the European trials . Okay , yeah . It 's ... Work stuff , sorry . - Work , work , work . - [ Laughs ] Scott : I 'll show her out . You know , my security concerns , they 're not jealousy . I 'm French . We enjoy lovers . Wow , okay . Look , can we just put our minds together like we used to and leave the crazy science out of it ? - Sure . - Good . Because ... this isn 't good news . Donnie : It can get pretty thick , so you really gotta put your back into it . Sestra Alison has good taste . - Yeah , well , she 's very crafty . - In men . What ? Huh ? You have meat on your bones . You are strong like baby ox . This I like . It 's not usually this thick when Ali does it . [ Ukrainian accent ] So maybe we need two baby ox . [ Laughing ] You are funny man , Donnie Hendrix . That 's very kind of you . [ Laughing ] Why don 't you try ? Okay ? Be very careful , it 's hot . [ Laughing ] I gotta talk to my wife . " Two babies . " [ Helena laughing ] Alison , we need to finish talking about this . I 've ... You made me lose my place . What ? Helena 's fine . It 's not ... Helena . Jason Kellerman kissed you . Donnie , he kissed Cosima . He thought it was you . It wasn 't me ! He thought it was , and maybe you would have kissed him back . Donnie , this is ... I 'll talk to him . I 'll talk to him ! I 'll clear this up so that he 's no longer under whatever misconception he 's laboring under . Gracie : Have a nice day . Look who 's here ! Donnie : Hi . Hi ! Are you ready for your first big day ? Yes . Thank you , Mrs. Hendrix . [ Helena humming ] Hello , Helena . Gracie . It 's nice to see you . You look so different . So do you . Helena , I 'm ... I 'm sorry I lost our baby . It 's not your fault . You will be auntie to my baby , yes ? I would like that . Thank you . Felix : Just think , Sarah . Had you finished high school , that could have been you . So this is simple identity theft , yeah ? We need to get her I.D. and her accounts to Rachel , so just get her wallet . And S will make a passport if it 's not there . Yes , got it . Can you hear me ? - [ Squeal ] - Shit ! Yes . Holy ... Good . Um , you know how to get her passcodes , yeah ? You 're not the only hustler in the family . I promise you , she 'll never pick me out of a line up . Make sure she stays naive . Felix ? We don 't need anyone else in Clone Club , and she doesn 't need this shit . Here we go . This is what happens when you hang out with a guy ... that 's my problem , that 's what I 'm not doing . Oh , hello . [ American accent ] Hi , there . - Hey . - How you doing ? - Good , you ? - Good . I got an appointment with Krystal . Hear she does a mean mani-pedi . A man who cares for his extremities . That 's hot . [ Laughs ] Come . Yeah . Scott : Denise ? Denise baby ? I 'm home . [ Cat meows ] [ Cat meows ] Rudy : Hello , Scott . Do you know who I am ? You 're ... Castor . You have a very extensive Sci-Fi collection , Scott . Thank you . You think I could , uh , borrow a good book ? [ Meows ] Please . Denise has feline asthma . Oh . Well , I was going to call on your friend Cosima , but I hear she 's not doing well either . Do you think I 'd like ... Asimov ? Probably . It 's classic . A little too heady . Is that what you 're telling me ? No . Go ahead , take it . Take the " Foundation " trilogy . Well , there is , um , one title in particular that I 'm interested in . A very special edition of H.G. Wells . " The Island of Dr. Moreau . " Krystal : I couldn 't even . I still can 't . You know , identical twin abductors ? How freaky is that ? Poor Hector . And I saw the guy with the scar stab the hotel security guard in the throat ! Krystal . I 'm sorry . I , like ... I have nobody left to talk to , so I just kind of ... [ Clears throat ] talk to everybody . Yeah . Is that okay ? Yeah , I 'm a good listener . Yeah , I can tell . It 's just been very , like , damaging for my psyche . - Mm-hmm . - My biggest fears are literally twins and clowns . Clones ? Clones ? Clowns . Clow ... clowns . Yeah . No , clones are worse . Twins . Twins , way worse . Totally . Terrifying . - [ Laughs ] - Hey , steady on , Fee . Uh ... - So what do you paint ? - What ? I can see flecks under your nails , so ... it 's a dead giveaway . Uh , houses . Oh . I 'm pretty good with my tools . I bet you are . Wow , Fee , you don 't have to shag her , just get her info . Hey , um , have you even played this game ? It 's called what 's your porn name . No , but can it be anything , like , bitch mistress of Cumalot ? - No . - No ? It 's your first pet 's name , plus your mom 's maiden name . Oh , okay . Um ... Muffins Slowikowski . Nice . [ Laughs ] - It 's good ? - Yeah , that 's pretty sexy . It 's dirty . It 's dirty 'cause it 's not , you know ? Sure . Sarah : All right , try to get a school name or something . Are you all right ? Yeah . Yeah ? You sure ? I don 't know , do you ever , like ... do you ever just feel like ... something 's not right ? Like ... I 'm not super-smart , but I 'm not super-stupid , either . What do you mean ? Like , my boyfriends are on a two year rotation . Like , before Hector , there was Craig . Like two years to the day , he leaves for Alaska . And , like , why do hotel security guards have submachine guns ? Like , why did the cops just drop the whole thing so quickly ? I just feel like I 'm missing something really big . Listen , honey ... Felix , don 't . I have to . No , no you don 't ! You have to what ? - I have to ... - Fee . Don 't tell her . I have to use the restroom . - Oh ! - I 'm gonna be ... I 'll be right back . Okay , and keep ... - Hands up . - Yeah ! Dude , just get her wallet and get out . Felix : [ Normal voice ] I hate this , Sarah . I think I 'm in the staff room . Mm-hmm . Got a couple of lockers . [ Laughs ] Of course . What , did you find something ? Far too much , actually . Hello , Miss Goderitch . Shit . Sarah : What ? Sarah , she 's ... more than suspicious . She 's investigating this shit . She 's starting to piece it together . Just get out of there . Get her wallet and leave . That 's enough of this . Excuse me . You don 't belong here . [ American accent ] Yeah , couldn 't agree more . I thought it was the loo . Thanks . Hey . Ready for your pedi ? Krystal , I am so sorry . I 've gotta bolt . I , uh ... I just forget that I 've ... Oh , my god . Okay , I talked too much . - No ! No no no no no . - No , I did , I did . I just ... everything 's kind of on the front of my brain right now , and I just like used to trust people and now I feel like I have to be paranoid all the time . Oh , Krystal ... [ Normal voice ] Bloody hell . Look , darling , there 's only one thing you need to know . What happened to your voice ? Nothing . This is my truth voice . Oh . The only thing that you need to know is that you are one of a kind . You 're a survivor , Krystal . And you 're not alone . That is the most completely beautiful thing anyone 's ever said to me in , like , ever . Now I have to go . Take care . Thank you . Great . I feel like shit . We just stole this girl 's identity for bloody Rachel . I know , I 'm trying not to think about it . You know , she 's a lot smarter than you think she is . She suspects something . She suspects something big . Yeah . Not being able to put your finger on it . I know that feeling . Well , let 's just get the hell out of here before we make it worse , okay ? Yeah , good idea . [ Engine starts ] Delphine : The European team , cutting-edge gene therapists . But Duncan only gave us one synthetic sequence to work with , so ... So they failed . She ... she died . Yeah . It 's no surprise , and so we have no idea how any of his sequences interact . [ Clicks tongue ] Unfortunately for ... " Identity redacted . " Um ... she 's Polish . That 's all I can tell you . Cosima , within the next month , you 're going to need another stem cell treatment from Kira . I 'm not doing that to her again . I 'm not gonna keep harvesting her . Okay . Then let 's ... let 's think . How are we going to unlock and identify the rest of the synthetic sequences ? [ Mobile buzzing ] Hello ? Sc ... Scott , I can 't ... slow down . What is it ? What book ? Jason : I 'm proud of you , Ali . I mean , you took this place and made it yours . Well , it 's essentially the same , but ... But that 's not why you asked me here . No . No . I thought we should talk about the campaign mixer and ... you know ... You know ? No , I don 't . The kiss . The kiss . You want to talk about the kiss ? Yes . Or we could just kiss . No , no , Jason , no . You need to stop this . - I 'm married . - I know . Hey , marriage is complicated . I 'm safe . No one needs to know . No , no . This is a business relationship . If this has become something else in your head ... maybe you 're grasping at something you never had . I did , though , didn 't I ? You need to go . Okay , Ali . But the reality now is that we 're all in bed together , and I know you felt something . Delphine : A code from Duncan ... which could be the key to everything . I 'm sorry I called her . It was Castor . I panicked . No , it 's okay . It 's okay . He had your cat , it 's okay . Oh , it 's far from okay . Now Castor has this code because you didn 't trust what I would do with it ? Did you make a copy of the book ? No . I ... no . We thought it would be safer not to . Then who else knew about the book ? Because Castor knew exactly what they were looking for . Rachel can read it . You went to Rachel with this ? - How 'd it go with Jason ? - Fine . Fine . It was a misunderstanding like I said . - We 're on the same page . - Are you sure ? If he made any trouble ... Donnie , I don 't want to hear anything about this any more . - Mrs. Hendrix . - Whoa . Whoa . Whoa . - Hi . - I 'm really sorry . Helena and I need some spare sheets . Oh . You didn 't make up the beds ? - I was a little busy . - Alison : Okay . I 'll show you the linen closet , okay ? ( footsteps approaching ) Oh , my god ! ( stutters ) Can I help you ? I 'm afraid you can , Krystal . What kind of monster threatens a man 's cat ? More importantly , who is the rat that told Castor about the book ? All I know is Cosima told us to sit tight . Yeah , but what for ? Why ? [ Knock on door ] Hey . Painmaker . Rune Wars ? Scott 's board game buddy . He said to give you this . [ Sighs ] Thanks . Of course we made a copy . We 're not complete idiots . Sarah : Cosima , are you sure you want to go through with this ? Delphine may never forgive you . I think it 's a little late for that . I will keep her busy . You get ready to take care of Rachel . All : Bloody Rachel . Sarah , you said you wanted to move forward , right ? Well , if this book identifies the rest of Duncan 's synthetic sequences , then ... then we hold the key to ... to my cure , to cloning humans . Us , not them . Your call , luv . Delphine : You showed her one page of the book , which mentions Castor , and then all of a sudden , Rudy shows up ? Delphine : You tipped them off , didn 't you ? How ? She doesn 't even have the Internet . You have nothing to lose . You 'd sell your sisters off to Castor out of spite . I should have let you die . - [ Mobile buzzes ] - [ Gasps ] It 's Cosima . She wants to talk . Come on . Agricola , Scott ? Scott : Uh ... It 's therapy ? Just one hour , and I want you back in the lab . Dude . You rule . It 's like your game life has overtaken your real life . Uh , I think it 's more the other way around . Rachel , Hell-Wizard . Hell-Wizard , Rachel . Hell-Wizard : Hey . I shut down four cameras , which is so cool . Just make sure you stick to the security route . Thanks . Um ... Can you ... can we go faster ? This is top speed . Right . There 's a handi-van on P6 , public parking near the smoker zone . It 's gassed up and good to go . Do it . [ Mobile dings ] You 're resigning ? Effective immediately . [ Sighs ] [ Whispering ] Alison . Alison ? Donnie ! Hey . Hey , Alison texted me to meet her here . Yeah . That was me . Oh . - I get it . - No , you don 't , because you thought my wife would skip out and meet you in the stockroom . Just like old times . These aren 't old times . These are my times . Your times ? You mean " Donnie takes her last name " times ? I got the ring , Kellerman . I don 't care what you got . You work for me now , you understand ? If I want your wife , I 'll just take her . Did you just girl-slap me ? You want a slap ? You want a slap fight ? How 's that , slap ? How 's that , slapper ? You like that , you boat shoe , chino-wearing bitch ? I may be a bitch , but I 'm Alison 's bitch . And you 're just a stupid dropout . Shit . Delphine : You don 't quit us . In here , you have access , you have control . Out there , what , you 're ... just another subject , but worse . What could be worse than this ? You 're self-aware . Any person , any face , any love , anyone could be a spy . Is that a threat ? Look . I 'm talking about Shay . Oh , my god , this doesn 't have anything to do with Shay . Maybe . But how are you gonna know without me ? Delphine , if you 're not gonna be with me , if you 're not going to switch sides , let me go . Scott : Careful , she 's delicate . Felix : Yeah , delicate like a spider 's web , aren 't you , Rachel ? Siobhan : Well done , Scott . Will you look who 's back . Hello , Sarah . Sarah : Krystal Goderitch . Felix : Nice girl . Worth ten of you . Sarah : Yeah , so you better make this worth it , Rachel . You 're gonna translate that , cover to cover , or else we send you back to Delphine . Thank you . The day you left for Frankfurt , I almost died . I had ... some kind of near-death experience . And it was so easy . I could have just slipped away . But then I had a vision of you . I came back for you . Why didn 't you tell me ? Because you don 't believe stuff like that . Because we have to move on . Come here . I 'm sorry . You should have trusted me . " In London town , we all fell down , " and Castor woke from slumber . Find the first , the beast , the cursed . " The original has a number . " The original ? What 's that , the Castor Original ? Maybe . H-4-6 2-3-9 ? What 's that ? Felix : Oh , shit ! - Sarah , the code . - Shit . Nealon : Not wise , Mrs. Sadler . It 's quite the sight you two make . Thank you , Rachel . You ... filthy ... I 'm sorry to raise any false hopes , but Delphine knew you had a copy . M ... m ... my book ... m ... my father ... Nealon : Rachel . Rachel ! She 's having some sort of seizure . Call a medical team . Nealon ? You assured me she could handle them moving her . I 'm sorry , I thought she could . Here 's the copy . It 's no use without her . She 's the only one who can read it ! Please , I have to get her to surgery . Should have made two copies . Yeah . Amateur hour . Delphine was onto us the whole time . Nealon : The stress was too much for her . She suffered an acute intra-cranial bleed . I 've induced a coma to control the swelling , but ... she may never recover . My apologies . Get back to your patient . We couldn 't give you the book because if Topside had gotten ahold of it ... Topside ? Scott lost the book because someone close to you tipped Castor off . It would have been safer with me . Where 's the copy ? Secure , and absolutely useless . You just cost us the one person who could translate it . Your resignation is accepted . And so is yours . - But I did ... - You might need this when you 're out in the cold . _ Security will see you out . Felix : In London town , we all fell down , and Castor woke from slumber . Well , it 's not quite Chaucer , is it ? London . - What do you mean ? - Well , the bit Rachel translated , it points to London . It 's our best lead . It 's our ... [ Chuckles ] Only lead . To the Castor Original ? If they find him , then they 'll never stop . We need to get to him first . - Yeah . - Bloody hell . Are we going home ? [ Mobile rings ] Hello . Rachel : Dr. Nealon . Nealon : Rachel . I trust you had a ... pleasant journey abroad ? You did well . Dr. Cormier has no idea you 're gone . Neither does Sarah . You played them perfectly . Take care of ... Krystal . Oh , she 's in good hands , as are you . You 'll wake up with a perfectly matched prosthetic eye . You 'll be your old self in the mirror again . Doctor : Es ist zeit anzufangen , Ms. Goderitch . Rachel : Danke , Doctor . [ British accent ] Thank you , Allen . She 's in your hands now , ma 'am . [ Air hissing ] Siobhan : When we find the Castor Original , there 's only one way this can go . I 'm going to kill him . Siobhan : ♪ Are we gonna get rough ? ♪ How much time do I have ? ♪ Are we gonna stay on the floor ? ♪ Now you come to me because now you believe your girlfriend is a mole for Castor . - Ferdinand . - Good afternoon . ♪ Are we gonna stay on the floor ? ♪ Helena , what did you do ?

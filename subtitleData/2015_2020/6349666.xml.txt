 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Fitz ! You 're safe . That portal won 't open again . But it has to . I have to go back . I 'm on my third hand . May took off on vacation and never came back , so I lost my right hand , too . Things keep coming at us . New Inhumans , the ATCU , and this new guy . You should have seen him . It was a whole new level ! Do you even know who the hell I am ? Ward : You 're Werner von Strucker . Your father was one of Hydra 's greatest leaders . Hydra 's fractured . We 're gonna rebuild it . - Man : Dr. Garner ? - Yeah . I was hoping to add your class . I plan to put Ward six feet underground . - What 's your way in ? - From below . Climb the ranks . [ Indistinct shouting ] You certainly don 't make it easy to get a meeting . The boss doesn 't want it to be easy . But he 's always interested in meeting people who can prove themselves . 03x04 - Devils You Know I can 't tell . I can 't tell just by looking at it . Can you ? Nobody can . It 's chicken . [ Sighs ] I think I 'm gonna have to cut into it . - ' Cause there 's nothing worse than dry chicken . - Yep . I got you . - Thanks . [ Knock on door ] - Are you expecting someone ? - No . [ Chuckles ] No way . - Alisha , what are you doing here ? - Hey . Sorry to drop by like this , but it 's important . The Terrigen got out . When we saw Lincoln in the news and all that stuff about a government task force ... We knew it was bad . We just didn 't know how bad . The world sees us as a threat . We need to stick together ... those of us who 've been here since before the Outbreak . Wait , are you the one who sent us that weird e-mail the other day ? - What e-mail ? - The one about finding the rest of our people , bringing them back together . No . Can you show it to me ? [ Thud ] No ! [ Grunting ] [ Electricity crackling ] [ Screaming ] [ Gasping ] Alisha , talk to me . What 's happening ? She 's dead . He killed her . It 's here . Daisy , Mack , move in now ! [ Screams ] Something 's attacking ! Alisha 's down ! [ Gasps ] No . Sir , we 've got three dead . We 're gonna need backup . Looks like the killer 's on the ... Daisy , wait ! Daisy ! Damn it . Coulson : Alisha ! Alisha , can you hear me ? ! He 's here . He 's here to kill us . And you can 't stop him . Bobbi : I assure you , we 're looking for the suspects right now . Please just go back into your apartments and lock your doors . Thank you for your cooperation . Detective . [ Indistinct conversations ] Think they bought it ? Don 't know . The old lady 's a trickster ... Had her hand on one of those 911 Red-Alert necklaces . We don 't have much time before the official authorities get here . Gather whatever you can find before we lose the scene . I thought this was just supposed to be a recruiting mission . It was . I don 't know where this attack came from . Is Alisha gonna be okay ? She felt it happen ... went into shock . Med team 's evac-ing her to containment now . Before the attack , she said something about the couple getting an e-mail . - Fitz ? - Laptop . On it . What about Daisy and Mack ? They could use backup out there . I know you really want to get back into action , Agent Morse , but the answer 's " no . " You 're still rehabbing . You haven 't passed the physical . - Understood , sir . - Daisy , what 's your location ? [ Static ] Daisy , do you copy ? You 're cutting in and out , sir . We 've trailed the killer to the industrial park a half a mile South of you . Backup would be nice . Coulson : On its way . Hold tight . Copy that . How did I let you talk me into this ? I had a garage , workbench full of new tools , my own espresso machine . We got to figure out how this thing is finding Inhumans - and why it 's killing them . - I know why . - Yeah ? Why ? - Instinct . It 's like a great white shark , built to eat , sleep ... And kill . I was gonna say " make little baby sharks , " but then " Jaws " was probably 20 years before you were born , so ... [ door slams ] Do we have movement ? I don 't know . I can 't see a damn thing . Well , do you want me to take point ? I 'm going . I 'm going . Hmm . Found something . Could be from our monster . - Oh , blue . Not clear . - What ? I said , " blue . Not clear . " How many times am I ... Okay , look , Simmons and I have created a system . " B " is for " blue " is for " biological sample . " Right , another system . How could I forget ? [ Tapping ] Just saying ... where I come from , blue is for recycle . Well , that is insane . " R " I could understand ... " R " is for " red " is ... Regardless , we could use Simmons ' eyes on these samples . [ Grunts ] Think she 'd be up for that ? - Uh , I don 't know . - Heard you guys had dinner . Mm-hmm . She open up to you at all about what happened to her ? Not really . Why ? Did she say something to you ? No . [ Helicopter blades whirring ] - Fitz : Helicopters . - We need to move . Oh , it 's got to be long gone . I mean , something that big can 't just slip away without ... [ Thud ] Damn it . I had to jinx it , didn 't I ? Sounds like something 's trying to get out . Or in . Come on . Three two ... [ Guns cocking ] Put the weapons down ! Get down ! Put it down ! Put it down ! - Put your weapons down ! - Lower your weapons ! Rosalind : Stand down ! Everybody , stand down ! S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s not the enemy , and you definitely don 't want to piss off the young Agent Johnson here . We 've got about 19 Agent Johnsons on our side , though none that can take down a building . Rosalind Price , by the way . - Coulson ? - It 's okay . The ATCU is here to help . Really ? ' Cause , the other day , they wanted Daisy 's head for their trophy case . - Agent Mackenzie . - Rosalind : Bit of an exaggeration . But that was then , and this is now . And right now , we 're here to contain a threat , same as you . Fan out ! I get that you cut a deal with them , but for the record ... It 's a means to an end . Ours or theirs ? Pack everything , computers , clothes , phones , - anything they 've touched . - Where are you taking the victims ? That 's classified ... Oh . It 's not fun when it 's you , right ? Can 't believe I just said that to the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. You know , I 'm really not feeling the spirit of cooperation here . You know , we had an agreement . You were supposed to share intel . And I did , ' cause , look ... you 're here . How did you find them , Coulson ? And why wasn 't I informed ? You were informed as soon as we engaged the hostile . I 'm talking about before you got here . This is the first time I 've encountered a couple like this . - How so ? - This wasn 't the usual response call to deal with somebody who just turned . - Look around . No cocoons . - Maybe it didn 't happen here . Shane and Lori Hanson ... They lived here for the last 18 months , and yet never visited an emergency room , never missed time at work , didn 't socialize with co-workers , had zero presence online . So they were introverts . They were already enhanced before the Outbreak . So I will ask you again , in the spirit of cooperation how did you find them , Coulson ? - They were friends of a friend . - You mean Daisy 's friends . Look , we can do this all day , but there 's an enhanced person out there killing people , and I 'd really like to catch him . Are you gonna help or not ? I like when you get all tough . All right , we 'll take it from here . I 'll call if I find anything . [ Breathes deeply ] You 're welcome , by the way . Oh , don 't take it personally , Phil . I 'm sure you have other evildoers out there to catch . Nice haul . New recruit brought you these ? Yeah . Same bloke who brought these took out Spud last week . He 's a tough bastard . I like that he didn 't come empty-handed . Hmm . Might be helpful on the next job , whatever that is . [ Gun cocks ] Sorry , Kebo . That 's level seven . Level seven . Right . I 'm messing with you . It was a S.H.I.E.L.D. thing ... one of their ridiculous codes of bureaucracy , though I will say there are a few things that S.H.I.E.L.D. got right ... things they valued . And I don 't mean money ... or power or resources . Now , take this job , for instance . It 's all about accountability , patience , an attention to detail that requires a ... personal touch . Those kinds of things mattered at S.H.I.E.L.D. [ Grunts ] [ Thud ] Almost a shame we 're gonna bring it all down . - May : So , what 's the job ? - Don 't know . - When 's it going down ? - Don 't know . - Any idea where ? - Not yet . You do realize the point of intelligence gathering is to gather intelligence ? The point is , I 'm moving up the food chain . And that lunatic Kebo is finally bringing me in on a job . Or luring you into a trap . We have to be smart about this . It 's not complicated , really . Just point , shoot , repeat as necessary . You don 't have enough intel . It 's sloppy . If it 's a chance to find Ward , it 's worth it . What happens if you walk into a roomful of Hydra enforcers with guns pointed at your head ? That 's what you 're here for ... to help . Try to keep up , love . This isn 't funny , Hunter . What if there are innocent lives at risk ? There 's always lives at risk ! You were there ... when Bobbi was bleeding out in my arms . Ward did that . If I have a shot at finding him , I 'm taking it . I have to ... before Bobbi gets back in the field . Look ... I want Ward as bad as you do . But I don 't think his life is worth yours or Bobbi 's . Well , on that , we can agree . Once you get the time and place , call me . Yes , mum . Bobbi : The DNA results came in . They confirm the killer is an Inhuman . - He 's killing his own kind . - I don 't get it . If he knows what it 's like , what we go through , I just ... I refuse to believe Mack 's " great white shark " theory . He 's not some mindless wrecking machine . Agreed . The killer 's tracking its prey . The question is how . Alisha knew these people . They were friends of hers before the Outbreak . Maybe the killer was , too . It 's possible , but before Alisha was attacked , the couple mentioned that they got some weird e-mail , right ? Well , that e-mail had a nasty virus attached to it . It chewed up the operating system like a blender . I was able to un-mangle it , and it looks like the virus was planted to track their location . Do we know of any other Inhumans who got this e-mail ? Joey Gutierrez didn 't . I checked . But the others ... I don 't know . It 's not like we have a ton of candidates to work with . Reach out to the ATCU . Let them know what you found . Taking this team-spirit thing a little far , aren 't we ? Fitz and I grabbed that laptop before they got there . Why would we share this intel ? We know the ATCU has found Inhumans in the past , confiscated all their belongings . Let 's see if they 've come across this virus before . If we share with them , what do we get in return ? - What do you want ? - I don 't know . Let 's start with how many Inhumans they 've come across , - where they take them . - Daisy has a good point , sir . We don 't know nearly enough about them . I agree , but if we want answers , then we gotta play ball . Share the intel , trace the virus to its source . It was bitter , not sweet at all . I 'd imagined the taste of a fresh strawberry for months , but like most things since being back , - it just wasn 't what I 'd remembered . - Most things aren 't . Memories have a funny way of changing on you when you 're not looking . How about you ? You feel any different since you 've been back ? Besides your taste buds , I mean . - Any trouble sleeping or anxiety ? - No . Shock , rage ... - depression ? - I know you 're looking for signs of PTSD . But I assure you , I 'm fine . You 've been through something pretty extreme . There will be after-effects , and that 's okay . It 's okay to struggle , to feel uncomfortable in your own skin . I 'm not one of your Inhuman patients , Dr. Garner . No . No , you 're not . But survivor stories have always fascinated me ... how they got through it . The Chilean miners relied on routine ... work , exercise , rest , gave each other jobs . - They had each other . - Well , not all of them . One hiker was stranded on mount hood for six nights in the snow . Said her faith saved her ... that and the thought of all the loose ends she left behind , the people she cared about . - She never gave up hope . - I did . Do you remember a specific moment when that happened ? Honestly , I 'd rather look forward than back . I have a very interesting new project - that I 'm trying to focus on . - It 's okay . You don 't have to talk about it . Just know you got a lot of friends here who care a lot about you . You 're safe now , Jemma . It 's over . [ Breathes deeply ] You 're wrong . Coulson : She puts up a good front , but I 'm worried about her . Dr. Garner : You should be . The woman was stranded alone on a barren alien world for months . She 's dealing with a lot of emotions and won 't open up about any of them . I know you can 't discuss specifics , - but is she making any progress ? - Nah . You can 't rush her . No field work . I mean it , Phil . And when I give you a recommendation , I want you to respect it this time . Hey , what are you talking about ? I 'm talking about the Inhuman you have in containment ... You know , the one I never even met , - let alone cleared for a mission ? - Alisha came to us . She was worried about her friends . And how many more like her are you hiding ? - That 's not what we 're doing . - These people have problems ! I 'm not just gonna turn a blind eye and rubber-stamp them for your new team . And I 'm not asking you to . This was a simple recruitment mission . Alisha wanted to go . Nobody saw that attack coming . You trying to justify that to me ... or to yourself ? [ Footsteps approaching ] - May ? - Coulson . Andrew . Am I interrupting something ? I can 't believe Hunter reached out to you like that . I specifically told everyone to give you space while you were on leave . Man 's on a mission . He 's desperate . - How desperate ? - His latest bad idea ... walking into a Hydra stronghold alone for a shot at finding Ward . I admire his courage . Sounds like suicide . Ward knows Hunter 's face . If there 's a chance they run into each other on this job ... - Hunter needs backup . - More than I can provide . That 's saying a lot . Most of our resources are focused on a manhunt right now ... or a monster hunt . But if this leads to Ward , that would be huge . - When is Hunter going in ? - I 'm waiting on specifics . But I know Hunter 's been operating primarily on the Eastern seaboard . He 's in too deep , Phil . It 's affected his judgment . [ Chuckles ] - What ? - It 's like you never left . - But I did . - Look , I 'm sorry Andrew 's here . I didn 't mean to make it more awkward . - It 's fine . We 're all professionals . - Yeah , but we 're also friends . If the reason you haven 't come back - is because we 're working with him ... - It 's not . I told you ... I can find someone else to consult . Don 't . Andrew 's really good at what he does . - You need him . - Yeah . But I can replace him . You ... not so much . What happened with you two ? [ Sighs ] The reason Andrew left me had nothing to do with S.H.I.E.L.D. It 's ... It 's about me . Always has been . You 're too hard on yourself . You know that ? - Hey . No tie ? - Still practicing . - Look better without it . - Thanks . I 'll call you as soon as Hunter reaches out . [ Sighs ] Bobbi : The hairs are deteriorating . That 's odd . Did you place it in the right receptacle ? - And double-checked the seal . - And the stain ? Fitz , we 're dealing with Inhuman DNA . Anything 's possible . I 'll check it again . [ Sighs ] What 's all this ? Data on the Monolith ? Schematics ? There 's notes all over this in Simmons ' handwriting . - Seismic mounts . Cry ... - What are you doing ? ! - Jemma , I 'm just trying to ... - No , don 't . Look , those are mine , and now they 're all out of order . - And you ... what did you tell him ? - Jemma , relax . We 're ... We 're just analyzing the Inhuman 's DNA . - All this data ... what 's it for ? - Just stay away from my things . What just happened ? Wha ... - Did she say something to you ? - It should come from her . - [ sighs ] Thought you left . - I was waiting for you . - Are ... Are you back ? - No . Melinda , can we talk ? - That 's what we 're doing . - Yeah . Not here . I mean ... could you slow up for a second , please ? Honestly , Andrew , I don 't need to hear any more apologies . We went away to figure out who we 'd be outside of S.H.I.E.L.D. You didn 't like what you saw . Let 's move on . That 's not true . I had a great time . [ Scoffs ] So did I , until you fell off the face of the Earth ... - no calls , no texts . - That had nothing to do with you . Please , don 't give me the " it 's not you , it 's me " speech . - You can do better than that . - You 're right . I ... I can do better , and I want to . I 'd just rather not do it here , now . Maybe after my class tomorrow , you could come by . - [ Scoffs ] I don 't think so . - Damn it , Melinda , I-I know I 've handled this all wrong . I shouldn 't have walked away like I did . [ Sighs ] I did the same to you . Now we 're even . [ Beep ] [ door opens ] I reached out to the ATCU and talked to that guy Banks . What did he give you ? Besides a case of the creeps , he said the virus I found was sent out to the other Inhumans they 've come across . - They just didn 't spot it . - See ? Cooperation pays off . It was hardly cooperation . Not only didn 't they find the virus , - but they couldn 't trace it , either . - I 'm guessing you did . [ Beep ] Meet Dwight Frye ... former programmer , serial online gamer , and I.T. guy . - The killer has an I.T. guy ? - What if he was one before he changed ? Interesting theory . He works for the social security administration . Yeah , but he hasn 't been there in weeks . He 'd have access to all kinds of records , be able to track people . Forget that . How did the ATCU not track him ? He 's one of their own . He 's a government employee . - You think the ATCU knew about him ? - Worse . - What if they 're running him ? - I think the conspiracy nut in you had a few too many lattes this morning . I did have a latte . It was a double . But if I didn 't know any better , I 'd say you were defending the ATCU ... - or the dragon lady . - I assume you mean Rosalind ? There 's that first-name thing again ... it 's a dead giveaway . I mean , don 't feel bad . She 's sharp , attractive , head of a big , shady organization . - I don 't like where this is going . - You think I do ? Go grab Mack and a flight team . We 're gonna see what this Mr. Frye has to say for himself . Copy that . [ sighs ] [ music ] Look who 's here . - Her again ? - Remember , best behavior . - Coulson . - Ms. Price . See ? - Called you first this time . - Very nice of you . - Signs of life inside ? - All quiet . Perimeter 's locked up . Once the threat 's contained , our holding facility is prepped to take him . I 'd like to see that sometime , make sure you 're not going all Guantแnamo . Oh , well , that can be arranged , as long as I can get something in return , like a visit to your secret base or maybe a ride on that fancy new plane ? You know that door won 't open itself , right ? [ Rumble ] [ Clatter ] Hey . Hey . It 's okay . We 're not here to hurt you . [ Whimpering ] What ? I ... I can 't hear you . What did you say ? Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! [ groans ] - Daisy , you all right ? - Yeah . But he 's not . Mr. Frye , come out and say " hello . " - How hard did you hit him ? - Not that hard . So what 's wrong with him ? I don 't know , but I don 't think he 's our guy . [ Groans ] She 's killing me . Get her out of here . He 's having some kind of reaction to our special friend here . You think ? If we want answers , might help if she 's not here . Just a thought . [ Sighs ] Well , pretty strong meds you got here . Ever since I turned , migraine hits me like a bus anytime I get close to one of ... whatever we are . The rash is just a bonus . So you 're a divining rod for others like you . Is that how you find your victims ? - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - We have all your computers . We know about the virus ... how you sent it to all of them . Rosalind : You 're the brains of the operation , and your giant pit bull does all the killing for you . Is that it ? Where you going , Mr. Frye ? - What the ... - Be careful . It 's got a laser finger . Talk to us . How did you know who these victims were ? Lash gave me their names . All I did was track them down . Lash ? Big guy , dreads , likes to leave holes in people ? - That sounds like our pit bull . - Yeah , great . Looks like good old Dwight here will lead us right to him . I don 't know where he is . I mean , he always comes to me . If all you did was track down the victims , - how did he know their names ? - Divine inspiration . You guys don 't get it . You should be helping him , not hunting him . Help him kill people ... 'cause , sure , that makes sense . Do you think he likes doing what he 's doing ? He doesn 't . Ever since I turned , I feel like my skin is on fire and there 's a jackhammer in my head . I wake up thinking that the pain will go away ... but it doesn 't . The only thing that helps is when Lash does his thing ... sends us freaks back to where we belong . I didn 't want this . And I know I 'm not the only one . Mr. Frye , we can help you , but you have to trust me ... - this Lash is not some angel of mercy . - No , he 's no angel . He 's just a guy trying to do the right thing . [ Helicopter blades whirring ] Andrew could help him . There 's no way the ATCU has anyone on their staff with his experience . Mack : And where are they taking him ? Do we even know ? We can 't just give them free rein like this . - We can 't just look away . - Mack , you accompany them . Check out the containment facility . Gather whatever intel you can . Report back to me . I should be on that truck , too , sir . We got a major Hydra operation unfolding . I may need you . - Not as much as Frye needs me . - Look , I don 't like it , " D. " You were in their cross hairs just the other day . Yeah , and look how that worked out . - We 're ready to roll . - Not quite yet . - How heavily sedated is Frye ? - On a scale of 1 to 10 , about a 6 . No one likes a drooler . Why ? I need you to squeeze two more onto that truck . That 's not what we agreed on . Sharing is a two-way street . We invited you to the party . Now we need to know what you 're doing with the guests . Come on , Rosalind . Fair is fair . Just give me a minute . All right . Hop on board . - Do you really have a laser finger ? - Sorry . It 's classified . [ Panting ] [ Beeping ] Looks like your rehab 's going well . Can 't lie . Doesn 't feel like it . I understand . I read up on your surgeries ... - two on the knee , three on the lung . - What 's left of it . Don 't forget those fun-loving abscesses . Well , knowing you , I 'm sure you 'll be 100 % in no time . I 'm sorry I snapped before . - No apology necessary . - I thought you told Fitz - what I told you , and I ... - Jemma , seriously , stop . I mean , here I am , complaining to you , after what you 've been through . Have you told anyone else that you want to go back ? You might want to . There 's someone in particular who 's really worried about you . [ Sighs ] I wonder who that might be . He 's driving me nuts , you know ? The other day , he snapped at me just because I put a bio sample into a clear specimen bag . Clear ? [ Chuckles ] Well , " B " is for " blue " is for " biological . " And now I see how that would drive you out of the lab . Actually , um ... it 's not all Fitz 's fault . [ Sighs ] I just got this old , familiar feeling in my gut and had to run . What feeling is that ? Like Hunter 's in trouble . [ music ] Clearly , punctuality ain 't one of Hydra 's core values . Funny . Hands on the car . [ Scoffs ] I thought we were past all that . Got to make sure you 're clean ... director 's orders . - Director ? - It 's a thing with the boss ... some kind of S.H.I.E.L.D. nonsense . - In you go , Richy . - Oh , I ain 't getting in the bloody boot . - It stinks of rotten bananas in there . - Does , doesn 't it ? [ Sighs ] [ sighs ] Always in the bloody ... Get comfy , now . It 's gonna be a long ride . Oh , when you say long , how ... [ Sighs ] - I feel like we 're driving in circles . - I bet we are . Probably buying time for Mr. Banks to clean up their facility . Didn 't you catch how fast he left the scene ? Yeah , so he could get rid of anything " Roz " doesn 't want us to see . Yeah , that , or he 's prepping a cell for you . [ Scoffs ] It 's his funeral . I feel like his meds are wearing off . [ Thud ] [ Tires screech ] [ Metal scraping ] [ Groans ] [ Grunting ] I only told them the truth ... that you 're being ... merciful . I 'm not merciful . I 'm necessary . No . No , no . [ Grunting ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] What the hell happened ? The ATCU brought us all to a local E.R. to get checked out . You got a concussion , separated your shoulder . - Everyone else make it ? - Not Frye . Lash killed him . - Lucky he didn 't kill you , too . - Yeah . Lucky . What 's up , " D " ? You holding something back ? I ... I saw something . And I 'm not sure , but I don 't think Lash is just some great white shark . I think he can turn into a person . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Wait . You ... You 're telling me that you saw him transform into a ... a regular guy ? It was all shadows , so I didn 't get a good look at him , but it would explain a lot ... How he comes and goes , disappears when he needs to . I mean , think about it , Mack . He could be anybody . Oh , good . You 're awake . - How you feeling ? - Like a truck fell on me . Well , at least you lived to tell the tale . Hmm . Where 's Coulson ? I 've been trying to reach him . He 's on a mission after a high-value target ... a human one , so not your thing . [ Indistinct conversation ] - And that too . Okay ? - Yeah . Good luck . Coulson 's leaving with a tac team ? May and Hunter have a lead on Ward . Sounds like a dodgy situat ... Wait . They didn 't tell you ? I 'm sorry . [ Sighs ] It 's tough when people keep things from you . [ Beep ] [ Tires screech ] [ Knock on trunk ] - Wakey-wakey . - Where are we ? [ Grunts ] Welcome to where all the fun begins . Director 's still mulling over a code name for the place ... " Nemesis , " " Omega point . " Sounds a bit too S.H.I.E.L.D. for my liking . Rumor has it the director spent some time with them . You planning some sort of raid ? [ Scoffs ] Always planning something . You can ask the director yourself . - So ... this the new guy ? - Yeah . - Turn around , Richy . - Yeah , Richy . - Why so shy ? - My name isn 't Richy director . Director , get to cover ! Aah ! Check the perimeter . Look for S.H.I.E.L.D. reinforcements . Kebo : I got nothing ! Not a man , not a vehicle in sight ! Ward : Come on , Hunter . You weren 't actually dumb enough to come here all cowboy , were you ? Sorry , this coming from the guy who shot his own girlfriend by mistake ? I was hoping you were dead and Bobbi was coming for me . At least that rematch would have been more even . Hunter : Hardly . I heard it took two of you after hours of torture . Yeah , lesson learned . Should have rigged the door with a grenade . [ Gunshots ] Took your bloody time . [ Gunshots ] - How many did you count ? - 11 , including Ward . - I 've taken out five . - Slow day ? Ward : May ... is that you ? 'Cause that would be great . I mean , I was hoping to hold out for a little while longer . Coulson , what 's your E.T.A. ? We 're still 20 minutes out from your position . You need to get out of there , May , right now . I 'm not sure we can do that . I don 't care if a fleet of helicarriers flies in here . That son of a bitch is mine . Ward : So glad you 're here , May . I was planning on heading out with a truck full of weapons that Hunter so kindly supplied . Looking to cause a little mayhem , draw S.H.I.E.L.D. out , when , instead ... [ beep ] - ... you came to me . - You 're trapped , Ward . Hey . Don 't interrupt . Not before you see my surprise . That 's a live feed , in case you 're wondering . Dr. Garner 's on his way to teach a class right now ... Psych 301 , I believe . I 've got my men on him right now . He 's bluffing . Watching him die like this isn 't quite the same as , oh , let 's say , holding the woman you love in your arms while she breathes her last breath . But , hey ... it 's the best I could do on such short notice . He 's trying to get in your head . The video is fake . [ Sighs ] Hey , what are you doing ? Alexander : Hey , professor . [ Lighter clicking ] Where you been ? If I don 't call off my men in the next 30 seconds , Dr. Andrew Garner , the ex-Mr . May , is a dead man . All you have to do is put your weapons down , - and I 'll let you go . - Son of a bitch . - You 're lying ! - I 'm not . Give you my word , May . [ Lighter clicks ] You know , you 're a tough guy to track down . What 's going on here , Alex ? [ Bell jingles ] [ lock turns ] [ Clicking continues ] He has a warehouse full of guns here that I brought him . A lot of people will die , May . - May ? - It 's Andrew . [ Breathing heavily ] I 'm sorry . No ! Coulson : May , what 's happening ? Come in . May . May : It 's Andrew . Ward 's going to kill him . You have to get to him ! [ Grunts ] Come on ! Come on ! [ Gunshots ] [ Gun cocks ] [ Grunts ] Lie down . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Ringing ] [ Panting ] [ Breathing rapidly ] [ knocking on door ] Come in . Thank Fitz , but there 's no reason to dote over me . I 'm fine . Why do you want to rebuild the portal , Jemma ?

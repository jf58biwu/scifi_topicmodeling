 When Beth died I took her identity . You 're her monitor . And she killed herself because the man that she loved Turned her whole life into a lie . Jason Kellerman ! You dumped my ass in high school . Give me those pills back , I will have your money back within the week , And I will double Ramon 's weight . The reason we can 't find the Castor samples Is because Johanssen used them , To make a clone . We don 't leave loose ends . No . I brought you Helena to keep Sarah off the table . - Hey ... - You did this to me ! That 's not what happened . We had the original Castor DNA , That is all you need to develop a cure . If you don 't put yourself out there , Then you 're never really gonna find What you 're looking for anyways . - Shay . - Cosima . - What 's her name ? - Gracie . And you consummated this marriage ? The child is lost ! You will not be welcome back here again . Your first logbook . Any intimate contacts , their names go in . I need to check your eyes . Get the keys . Get me out . Now , we are even , sestra . Kira ! Mummy . Baby . Come on , mum . Wait for me . Wait for me , Kira . Monkey , wait for me . You look tan . Grandmother was greek , I got the gene . Is that it ? Jesus . They each have one ? Maybe there 's an explanation . Something in their psychology . It 's not about their psychology . Maybe it 's a memory test or something . It 's research on civilians , unsanctioned . Look , I 'm gonna take this to the director , - But he 's gonna need more . - I 'll get it . Proof , paul . Find out what she 's up to , get evidence . Till then , we can 't act . I just hope it 's not as twisted as it looks . And yesterday , I saw an iceberg . Cal says it 's because of the tides . Just don 't let him feed you too much salted fish , okay , monkey ? Because then you 're gonna end up with a beard like him , darling . - Nah . - Yeah . - It 's epigenetics , monkey . It 's a proven fact . - No . It is . Is mummy mad at me ? - No . - Oh , no , love . No . She 'll be so sorry She didn 't get to talk to you . She misses you enormously . And when she finds out how much fun you 're having , She is gonna be so happy . Time to sign off now , love , okay ? Thanks to your dad for the call . - Remember , we love you . - I love you , too . Bye . Bye . Bye . - We 'll find her , fe . - Just stop , please . My people are working on it . Every time you say " my people " , I picture nine squatters around a tyre . Well , they 've tracked down Castor 's headquarters . To where ? Mexico , maybe . Information is spotty . S , it 's been five days , I can 't keep sitting on my hands here . I know . Thank you , honey , But you don 't need to serve us . Helps to have something to do . Then there 's her , cast out by her family . She 's suffering some kind of weird , mysterious disease . Well , Cosima 's working on that . Yeah . If raising Sarah has taught me anything , It 's how to survive worry . You keep on living . Fourth time this morning . - You slept through the others . - Oh , my god . Sorry . My co-worker is very excitable . Yeah , this very mysterious lab You work at , studying ... What is it ? Wait , I forgot . - Hold on . Black holes ? - Black holes . - You 're right . - Exactly . I made this for you . Put liquorice root in it , It will help with that cough you 've got . But you , my dear , have to earn it By telling me this , who 's Sarah ? What ? What do you know about Sarah ? Wow , bad topic ? How do you know that name ? I know that name because you were dreaming , And you said it . So I figured she was an ex or something . - Sorry . - Well ... Sarah 's a friend . She 's ... She 's like my sister . Wilder version of me . Doesn 't get much wilder than you . Dad . Dad ? - Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! - Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! - Don 't look ! - Mom ? We 're changing ! What ... What do you want ? Oscar put earwax on my gi . Okay . Well , uh , just change into a fresh one , okay ? I 'll be down in a minute . Go . Go . Don 't look . Do you have the keys to the van ? I told the sanghas I 'd drove to dojo . Well , no . There 's lawn signs in the van , Donnie , You 'll have to take transit . Oh , come on . I hate bussing to karate . The kids are all rangy after beating the shit out of each other . Lawn signs , Donnie . And I am meeting Jason later . That 's today ? - Yes . - I wanna be at that . Oh , for heaven 's sakes . We were high school sweethearts , that 's it . I 'm not talking about that , all right ? I 'm not talking about being jealous . Because I am jealous . Your man is savage jealous , Mrs. Hendrix . Mmm . But paying this debt to Kellerman is business . And if we really are gonna take it to the next level , Then we do that together . And that 's the way it 's gonna be . Hmm . Are your underpants tearaway , mister ? No . But the elastic 's wearing out . - So ... - Mmm . You 're late . Where have you been ? Uh , excuse me ? I tried calling you all morning . - Mmm-hmm . - Cosima , hang on . You 're back . I came as soon as I found out Sarah was missing . Five days too late . No thanks to you . Were you planning on telling us ? Yeah , that depends . - Who is " us " , delphine ? - It 's topside . Where I am protecting LEDA . But Castor remains impenetrable , Which is why I told Sarah not to go after them in the first place . Yeah . Well , wild type and all that . Tell me something . How did you two manage To get your hands on a Castor brain ? How do you know about that ? Because you ran the tissue through this lab , And Dr. Nealon is not an idiot . The prolethean girl , Gracie ... Gracie Johanssen , Why are you studying her ? Fine . You want to play games . Now , tell me something , In all your fun sneaking around , did you notice this ? The same misfolded protein . Found in both subjects . Holy cow . How did this happen ? We studied them in isolation , Had no reason to compare . The unique protein found in both Gracie Johanssen And the brain of a dead Castor boy . Now that to me warrants a follow-up . Don 't you agree ? Corporal . What happened ? Are you hurt ? They did something to me . - When ? - Last night . I don 't feel right . My god . You 're burning up . Thank you . Slow . Slowly . Slowly . You get me out of here , now . Trust me , I 'm trying . Just get me a car and a gun , and I 'll take my chances . I can 't . Paul , you are the worst of them . You know that ? Because I don 't even know where you stand . Welcome back , major . She isn 't well . I gave her an anti-inflammatory last night , She 's been having a reaction . It 'll pass soon enough . Bullshit . You did something to me . Rudy was there . She 's been feverish . So tell me , how was arlington ? Riveting . Hmm . Come . I 'll fill you in . Helena got away , didn 't she ? She won 't last out there . If the desert doesn 't get her , Rudy will . Helena , Did you hear the one about the pregnant girl Who fell down in the desert ? Leave me be . The only reason you 're alive is because of me . - Get up ! - I have no strength . It 's not exhaustion that stops you , You regret leaving Sarah behind . Don 't you ? I regret nothing . Why are you lying here , then ? Because your sister is more important than your baby ? No . Because I am hungry . What was done to Sarah manning last night ? You have to ask Dr. Coady , I wasn 't there . Since when are you left out of the medicine ? She 's the boss , she shares what she wants . Look , you were gone for months , paul . Things changed . How ? When I left , we were trying To cure six soldiers . When we were still stateside , maybe a month after you left , Rudy came back from leave with a girl . She was sick ... Hey , doc . Bloodshot eyes , dizzy . Coady treated her . - On base ? - I didn 't think much of it . But after that , the science took a turn . Things got more secretive . The boys were told to record their intimate contacts . You mean take hair samples . Which I test for genetic precursors . Coady says it 's for security purposes . But you know that 's not true . I think she 's getting baseline numbers , Before pictures . - Before what ? - I don 't know . A different team follows up . I don 't have access . In her quarters , That 's where she keeps that material . I understand that you 've been missing work , Coming in late . Are you not feeling well ? I feel great . Good . There 's nothing I should know ? No . Delphine . Felix . And you must be Gracie . I know you 've probably heard many frightening things about this place . A rare instance of prolethean wisdom . But I can assure you that we are here to help . But you already did tests at Mrs. s 's house . Trust me , I know how much this sucks , But we 've got some amazing technology here That 's , um , gonna help us learn more , okay ? Uh , this is scott . Gracie . Come on in . Ladies , we 're gonna give you a bit of privacy . Gracie , be strong , my little urchin . - What is it ? - I need your help with something . And it 's really important , so I don 't want any quivering . Okay . I want you to take me to rachel . What ? If anybody knows about Castor , it 's gonna be her . I 'm not authorised . I 'm not even supposed to know where she is . Yeah . But you do , don 't you ? Scott , my sister is missing , And I am really , really desperate . Okay ? Now , nut up , and lead me to the cyclops . Sergeant rollins . Mark , right , from sammy 's team ? And you 're major dierden . When we first met out in the field at that bar , I had no idea . Ah , we were both undercover soldiers , I was just trying to keep it that way . Good work retrieving the Castor DNA . Yeah , well , I had help . You brought Sarah manning in . I was with Rudy . It was either take her or terminate . I made the call . And marrying the Johanssen girl ? Was that a call , too ? Speak freely . Fell in love with her . I need you to do something . Unofficially . Ah . " for my old friend Jage . " Well , you know , in high school we all called you " Jay-Jay " , But then I shortened it to " Jage " . There 's every single dollar in there , you 're paid in full . Yeah , I see that . It 's the " continued prosperity " part that concerns me . I mean , your debt 's paid , Alison , you can walk away . But we don 't want to walk away , We wanna take this to the next level . The next level ? Alison ... Whoo ! Did you see that ? Yeah ! Oh , geez louise ! - I was about to brain you , man . - What ? I 'm sorry , whose car is this ? It 's ours , baby . You bought this ? 10k down , in cash . You should have seen the guy 's face . I don 't think you guys are ready for the next level . What ? Why not ? Because , Donnie , Conspicuous spending is the surest way To attract the attention of the authorities . Cars aren 't conspicuous , Alison , They 're , like , everywhere . There 's only one way to launder money , You pay taxes on it . You guys need a front . And I 'm sorry , ali , But your garage-made soap is not gonna cut it . I have a plan . You do ? What plan ? It 's something I 've been mulling over for a while , It 's a business plan . We have five minutes . So this protein , it 's in my blood ? That 's right . It 's similar to something we found in one of , Um , your husband 's brothers . I know what Mark is . Then you know that what 's in Mark 's brothers is in Mark , too . We think that 's maybe how it got transferred to your system . Jesus . Go back to your post . You mean , Mark made me sick ? But Mark isn 't sick , he 's strong , he 's healthy . The protein can have a different effect on different people . What ? What does this mean ? Sir , tell me . Delphine ? What ? - It 's okay . - What is it ? It 's contagious . Your defect , it 's actually transmitted . What does it do to the women who catch it ? Temperature 's 103 . Heart rate increasing , 122 . Thank you . That 's expected . Virginia ? I 'm placing you under arrest . On what grounds ? You 're sterilising women . You are unfit to lead . I am taking charge of this camp , And I will use force , corporal . Patience , son . Put them in the stockade . That 's an order . Lock ' em up ! Sarah . Sarah . Sarah . You gave her the Castor pathogen , didn 't you ? Tell me . Yes . She received two units of Rudy 's blood . Dr Silva . Sarah , come with me . - I can 't get up . - You don 't have to . Just hold my hand . Think carefully . Turn around . You know how to use this ? - Yeah . - Don 't let anyone in here . Come with me , Sarah . Don 't worry . It 's this way , Sarah . Come on . I 'm here by the beach , Documenting my marathon lady , in training . Are you ready to put your body Through months of hell ? You 're damn right . Come on , Sarah , we 're almost there . Don 't be afraid . There 's my lovely girlfriend , Beth . Beth , say hi to the camera ... hey , there you are . Beth . Just thinking about the day paul moved in . You remember that story ? I don 't think I know it . He had two suitcases to his name , that was it . That should have been a huge red flag , right ? I was so gaga for him . I convinced myself he was some kind of zen master . Materially unattached . " You two are a good match . " Liars . Grifters . I didn 't know you , Beth , when I took your life . Now , I miss you . No ! You don 't get to miss me , Sarah ! You hear me ? I won 't accept that ! I 'm trying to finish what you started , To help our sisters , but I keep failing . Helena 's left me , and Cosima 's still sick . And I let you jump . No . I jumped . I let myself get consumed by this thing . I killed myself because I couldn 't understand it . Neither do i . You 're starting to . I don 't understand the why . Why did you take over my life , Sarah ? For Kira . We do terrible things for the people we love . Stop asking why . Start asking who . Sister . Where 's paul ? Jesus . Are you sure ? Sterilising them ? There 's medical records going back almost two years . - It 's some kind of human trial . - Okay . All the science , bag it , it 's evidence . It 's also the cure for the boys . We need to make sure that moves forward . We will . Where 's Coady right now ? Confined to quarters , camp 's on lockdown . Only people out are guys I trust . Good . Here 's what 's gonna happen now . You 'll need a formal removal of command order And an extraction team . Yeah . I will camp out at the director 's office until he sees me . Now , best case , I can have a team there in six hours . Can you keep a lid on things until then ? No sweat . Castor boys are not gonna take this sitting down . Are they all accounted for ? There 's one patrol still out . Rudy . You leave him out there . You don 't need that trouble , paul . Six hours . Hang in there . Okay , quick . Hello , rachel . Fft ... Fft ... Yeah , fft you , too . You know , it 's funny . Your hand was a lot steadier When you were jamming that needle into my neck , wasn 't it ? No , no , no . Let 's stay here , shall we ? You 're not allow ... - Allowed . - Yeah . - Here . - And you know what ? If you tell anyone about it , I 'm gonna come back , and I 'm gonna harass you Every day . I want you to tell me what you know about Castor . Castor . Hmm . R ... R ... Rumours . - Rumours . - No . No , no , no . Not rumours , they 're very real . And they 've taken Sarah , So I need you to tell me where they took my sister . Is that funny to you ? Well , let 's see what we can do about that , shall we ? Just stop . Rachel 's gonna get a bit of a makeover . - Ain 't she ? - Stop . - Felix ! - What ? I think this is just what the doctor ordered . - Stop ! - Yes . Do you want to see how pretty you look ? Aren 't you beautiful ? - Scott , get Dr. Nealon . - Tell me what you know . No one is coming for you ! Do you understand ? Because no one cares ! I 'm not going to help you - If you humiliate me . - Humiliate you ? I haven 't even gotten started . Why don 't we go for a spin ? Shall we ? Felix , we really should go . And maybe then she 'll tell me where my sister is ! Where did they take her ? Get me out of this place . Felix , let 's go . You sure about this , ali ? - You hate bubbles . - I hate the way my mother runs it , But when we own it , we 'll run it differently . - As a drug front . - Yes . Are we in this together or not ? - Yeah . - Good . Oh , shit . Your mother 's store . Yes , you remembered . I remember the stock room . Really ? Why ? What happened there ? Okay , let 's go inside . We should go in . Yeah ? Good , good . Okay . Come on in . Feel free to explore . Oh , we have My mother 's new men 's line . It 's minty gleam . It 's her original recipe , but we 'll probably update it with a little musk ... Okay , Jason doesn 't need to know about the musk . We do the musk part . This is just a courtesy visit , so you can see the business . You 're not gonna let go of this , are you ? No , no . I mean , this is a very reputable local business . - Yeah . - Eleven years of clean books . Good storage , centrally located for distribution . I mean , you 've seen how quickly we can move product . So with bubbles , the sky would be the limit . Selling soap . It 's perfect . I was supposed to have children . It was expected of me . Hey . You 've been through a lot recently , You don 't have to make sense of it all right now , okay ? Part of me feels relieved , Cosima . Does that make me a monster ? No , honey . So far from that . Shall we get you home ? - All set . - Okay . Cosima . I miss you . When ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm on it . There 's a situation back at base . What kinda situation ? We 're needed . Hey , come in . Damn . What is it ? I was coming here to tell you that I thought Maybe we should slow things down . Oh . But now that I see you , I just kinda wanna make out for , like , seven hours straight . Do you wanna talk about it ? Mmm , yeah . After , after . - See , this is my life right now . - Mmm-hmm . Shit . You 're just gonna lose patience with me . I guess we 'll see . Dude ? Cosima , the book ... Uh , Duncan 's book , With all the weird symbols and stuff . I think rachel knows the code . Human sterilisation trials . Dr Silva says you haven 't shown Any of the same symptoms as the other women . Did you love Beth , paul ? What ? Did you love her ? What happened to Beth ... I will carry that with me forever . We were looking for a cure And we thought dyad had answers . I wanna talk to Coady . Give us a minute . You gave me Rudy 's blood . Why ? Temperature 's down , no haemorrhaging . - Remarkable . - So you knew I 'd beat it . How ? Because Castor and LEDA have the same disorder . It attacks the boys ' brains , The women 's epithelial tissue . But as your fertility proves , Sarah , You 're somehow able to fight it off . You 're infecting innocent women with it . To understand it . I didn 't put it in the boys . I just found it . So , it 's engineered . Who engineered it ? Was it Duncan ? It 's a weapon . You 're field testing it . You wanna isolate it To develop it in other forms . It could end wars In a single generation Without spilling a drop of blood . So who wants it ? Who is it for ? - Where 's Rudy ? - He set out on foot . I lost contact . The hell 's going on here ? Major dierden has command . The camp 's on lockdown . - You 're confined to quarters . - That 's bullshit . Hey ! Brother . Paul and Sarah are still out there . We need to go . Help is coming . You 're still trying to save them . - None of this is their fault . Major . Major . Patrol came back , without Rudy . I checked the sat phone , And , major , they got a call from arlington . Paul , what 's your status ? That depends on you . Extraction team 's en route . Rudy 's patrol is still out . And we can 't reach their sat phone . Well , good . That 's what we want . Is there a problem ? No , sir . We 'll be waiting . We have to go . Go back to your quarters . You never spoke to me , do you understand ? Sir . Make this right . Miller , listen to me ! Listen to me ! Aah ! Miller ! Shit . Paul ! No . Let 's go . - Yeah . Yeah . - Let 's go . It 's this way . Through here . Through here . Hey . What are you doing ? This tunnel comes out of a garage . You take a jeep . Go north-west . Paul , I 'm not leaving without you . Open the gate . Listen to me , open the gate ! Paul . It was never Beth I loved . Paul . Paul ! What kinda guy are you ? - What kinda guy am I ? - Yeah . You know what kinda guy I am . First thing , secure the science . Does he know what he 's done to those women ? I know exactly what I do , sir . Rudy . Your devotion to my boys was pure , paul . I could always count on it . Cure them , Virginia . Drop the rest . The science in this room Could rewrite the very nature of humankind . You ask me to turn my back on it ? I 'm sorry , paul . I can 't . Run ! You came back . Come , sestra . People miss us . When I see this , yes , I will kill her . Hello , Helena . A vote for Alison Hendrix Is a vote for change . I can 't sell you the store . There 's been a hiccup . We need that store front in order to move all this product . We 'll have it to you by tonight . You know , whatever this is , it 's not cool . You know what ? I don 't really care . We 're drug dealers . He 's being held captive by some man called pouchy . Whoa ! What are you doing ? Oh , my god !

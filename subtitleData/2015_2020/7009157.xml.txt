 I quit . I killed Doctor Leekie . We can 't risk transporting him . Then we bury him in the yard . Not in the yard . Mr. Pouzhino , if you could reimburse us for the pills . There 's no refund , Mr. Hendrix . I got refund . She said you 're going to be my new mum . - Who ? - Professor Duncan . - Welcome home . - Mother . Hey , welcome to The Rabbit Hole ! Secret lab under a comic book shop ... what more could a girl want , right ? Congratulations . You 're having twins . I have to tell my sestra . I 've been looking for my birth family . - What ? - It 's about me finding out who I am . It 's right there . I 've heard rumors of high-level Neos with implanted tech , but this is next level . I think there 's something in my jaw . What is that ? Okay , Rachel . Let 's begin . I 'm going to flash the light on your eye . Now off . On . Now off . Yes , I 've gleaned the pattern . Thank you . - Any discomfort to report ? - No . Restricted motility ? - Unusual discharge ? - No . It looks like Pluto . Pluto isn 't even a planet , you know . It 's a runt , like your eye . That 's not very nice . How would you like if I teased you about your ... Malformed leg ? I wouldn 't let it bother me . You say that but you don 't get to decide what bothers you or not . That 's why it bothers you . Like our friend Ira , here . Follow the pen , please . I can see it 's still quite photosensitive . You 've been away . What makes you say that ? You 've missed three consecutive treatments reinforcing my suspicion that wherever we are is somewhat isolated . A day 's journey out and back . She thinks you went to fetch Professor Duncan . Locked in this room for six weeks without a single visit . When can I expect her ? You shouldn 't expect anything . I 'm going to apply a small amount of Neomycin ... Yes , I know the process . And you 're a pale shade of CASTOR , aren 't you ? Your brothers may be lackeys , but at least they 're men . As I have never met them , I don 't carry the same ... antipathy towards my siblings as you . Chin , please . I know Susan 's back . She 's watching us right now . No one is watching . Ew , pigment treatment . I hate this part . It 's what 's necessary for her eye to look normal again . Now that the tomb door has been opened , my cave spiders can take their rightful place in the unholy depths . Your role , fair Syndrael . Your mum 'll be up soon . They never tell me when things are bad . But I always know . - Holy cow . - What 's it doing to me ? Uh , it looks like it 's latched on . You see that ? There 's some kind of attaching mechanism . Is it penetrating the maxillary artery ? What ... What does that mean ? Penetrating the artery . Why would it do that ? I don 't know . I mean ... We 'd be guessing . So guess . What 's it doing to me ? Oh . It looks like there 's some non-organic core . See that , in the tissue ? That could hold a payload . Well , it 's not a tracking device . At least not primarily . It 's way too over-built for that . And it must produce some anesthetic , like a leech when it latches on . That 's why she doesn 't feel it . What does it do ? I 'm sorry , Sarah . I 'm ... Without further study , there 's no way of knowing . This one 's igneous . This one 's sedimentary . Did you learn that in your online courses ? - Mmm-hmm . - Lucky you . I 'm not allowed a computer ... much less a window to the world . What 's " Adam 's rib " ? An archaic religious reference . Where did you hear that ? I knew you were back . Hello , Rachel . Good . Look at you . That is demonstrable progress . You can go to hell . If I can 't find MK , I need to find this Dizzy guy . - Who now ? - The guy who showed me the video . Maybe he knows how to take it out without killing me . Listen to me . I have reached out . We are going to find a doctor who can remove it . But you have to get some rest . When did you last get any sleep ? I need to tell Fee . Okay . At least I know where to find you there . Sarah , if Felix wants to search for his blood family , we have to support him . I can 't think about that right now . Let 's see if you can stand up to the power of Lord Merick Farrow . You still with me ? Kira , what are you doing ? - This game is stupid . - Kira ! Hey , what 's going on here ? I knocked over the game . - You did ? - It was just an accident . Hey , you behave , all right ? I 've got a lot to do today . I 'll be back soon . Yeah , sorry . S is downstairs if you need her . Ah ! Do you have to go so deep ? Honey , if I don 't go deep , I 'm not gonna feel anything . Um , yeah . You 're gonna wanna get all the way to the back , right behind the wisdom tooth . Well , I 'm definitely pretty far back there . Ugh . Okay , uh , now slide your finger down into the cheek . Anything there ? Honey , honey . Be still . Be still . Nope . Feels normal . Both sides . God ! What ... What is that godforsaken thing ? Is it harming Sarah ? Uh , apparently Neolutionists get them , like , voluntarily . Some kind of research device maybe . Biometric data collection ? We just ... We don 't know . Wait , they 're in Neolutionists ? According to Sarah 's contact ; Yeah . If you had one to study , would that be helpful ? Invaluable . Yeah , why ? Just thinking out loud . Ali , we are not gonna exhume the dead guy in our garage . That is a haywire plan . Donnie , my sister has a robot maggot in her face . You tell me what the solid plan is . Exactly . Now go rent a jackhammer . Maybe we should just buy one . Felix ? Hey ! - Hi ! - Who are you ? Oh , you 're expecting Felix . I 'm sorry . My brain 's a little ... Splat ! You know ? Yeah , he said he had a hook-up . He must 've pulled the trigger . I just gotta find my bag . Uh , mind you , I was picturing a fat-legged man wearing Crocs . No offense . It 's just how y 'all look where I come from . It is molly that we 're getting ? - Uh ... - You know what ? It don 't matter . I 'm not that choosy this time in the morning . Here we are . All right , how much do I owe you , honey ? Who are you ? Why are you going through Felix 's stuff ? Wow , you are protective for a drug dealer . - You don 't see that very often . - Adele ... - It 's kind of weird . - You should see how crisp it looks outside . It 's like ... - Oh , shit . - What 's this all about , then ? Sarah , this is Adele . This is my biological sister . - Hi . - This is my foster sister . Oh , Sarah . OH ... I 'm such a half-wit . Oh , of course , you 're Sarah . Wow ! You don 't happen to be a drug dealer , too , do you ? - Not any more . No . - Oh , okay . That would 've been too handy . Well , this calls for a celebration . Actually , Adele , I need to talk to my brother privately , - if you wouldn 't mind . - Uh-huh . Absolutely . Yeah . Two . What ? What is wrong with you ? What ? I told you that I was gonna look for my family . - I didn 't know you 'd met her . - She is so bloody cool , okay ? You are gonna think she 's amazing . She 's a lawyer . Or she was . But there 's some kind of , like , disbarment situation - or something , so she ... - How high are you right now ? Quite , I 'd say , if I had to put a number to it . - Why ? - Well , something came up , so tell her you need to rain check . No , I will not . It 's important , Fee . Well , this might come as a shock to you , but this is important to me , too . This is a profound moment for me . How do you even know she 's your sister ? She 's probably a Neolutionist plant . - Adele , what 's your favorite color ? - Red . - What 's your favorite drink ? - Oh , this one 's nice . You ever had sex for material gain ? Who hasn 't ? Come on . I can see you 're upset . I get it . But this means a lot to me , and frankly , I 'm not just gonna drop all my shit yet again because you 're short a sidekick . Then you can piss off . Great . You too , then . Uh , here . Thank you , Donnie Hendrix . Hey , um , I need you to watch the kids for a few hours . Alison and I have a project in the garage . - What is project ? - Nothing for you to worry about . Sarah won 't answer my calls . I can help with trouble . Well , sometimes your kind of help isn 't the kind that 's needed . Know what I mean ? Uh , just gestate and watch the kids . And nobody goes in the garage . Clear ? Like crystals . Great . Hey , why don 't we close that fridge door ? All right . Who the hell are ya ' ? I just wanna talk . Can I come in ? You stole my phone . I brought it back . I 'm Sarah . I 'm MK 's sister . Didn 't mean to lie . I just was trying to find her . Yeah . Listen , whatever your deal is , I 'm gonna take a pass . Yeah . Hey . Holy Jesus . Just give me five minutes . I , uh , started hearing some chatter a couple months ago . Piece of tech like that turns up , word travels pretty fast . What do people think it 's for ? There 's a bunch of theories . A biometrics monitor , a delivery system , like for insulin , narcotics ... What do you think it 's for ? I think , uh ... you 're not gonna like my answer . I don 't like any of the answers . Why place it in the jaw , where so much can go wrong ? If it 's for insulin , like , why not your thigh or your gut ? I don 't know . You tell me . Proximity to the brain ? Jesus ... You know what ? Don 't mind me . It 's just a theory . I need to get in touch with MK . How do you contact her ? " How do I contact my own sister ? " What 's that all about ? I didn 't even know I had one 'til a couple days ago . Well , you don 't find MK . She finds you . But if you wanna tell me what 's going on , maybe I could help . You can help me by telling me who that guy in the video is . Please , I need to get it out . Word going around , his name was Alonzo Martinez . I should think you 'd be grateful , Rachel , testing one of the first cybernetic eyes . Back on your feet again thanks to Ira 's help . Perhaps she 's upset because her pituitary hormone therapy has given her facial hair . Nonsense . I can 't see it at all . I kept thinking why else would she disappear for two months without a word ? Now I smell it . You failed to find the original , haven 't you ? So , Sarah Manning and her people have outfoxed us again while you leave CASTOR and LEDA alone in a ... bloody terrarium . Well , at least she 's kind to Charlotte . Yes , I 'm glad you are forming a bond with the child . She 's had an unfortunate series of guardians . Charlotte was cloned from you , you know . Adam 's rib . 400 attempts , I believe . Not a viable way to replicate you , but important nonetheless . Get out . - I beg your pardon ? - I prefer to eat alone . I have given you everything . The keys to the future . And your obsession with Sarah Manning blinded you . You failed to find the original . You failed to cure us by other means . Just leave me here to die alone . You are the failure , Rachel . You carry my last name , and you are the biggest disappointment of you all ! Why would you upset her like that ? Oh ! - Ah , Jesus . There it is . - Okay . Is it soft ? Oh , God . It must be like a root cellar down there , keeping him moist . Oh ! Oh , God , the smell . Bear down , Donnie . Almost there . Oh , God , it smells like hot garbage juice . - What ? - I said it smells like ... It smells like hot garbage juice . - Sarah . - Hey . - Jesus , you okay ? - Yeah . Come on in . The missing cheek case . - That 's what Beth was onto . - Yeah . Implanted Neolution tech . God , Sarah . They put one of these things in your mouth , too ? I 'm too scared to even bloody brush my teeth , Art . Oh , Jesus , Sarah . Art , I have to get this thing out . You really do . S and Benjamin are looking into doctors , but I don 't know which doctor 's gonna even know what to do with this . It exploded in that guy 's face . Wait , you said you had a name . Maybe I can help . - Alonzo Martinez . - Okay . Listen , I 'mma head down to the station and see what I can dig up , okay ? Sarah , you stay here . Get some rest . You look like you need it . - Thanks . - Yeah . I met Julian Schnabel once at a retrospective in LA . I was sort of bulimic at the time , so I thought ... - Thank you . - You 're welcome . I thought it would be fun to leave a puddle of barf in front of Dog in the Revolving Door . What ! Oh , my God . What I would give to barf on a Schnabel . Jesus . Now , Felix ... I know you didn 't go to all the trouble of finding me for a drinking buddy . No . All right . Okay , your dad , my dad . So weird . - It 's crazy . - He was an American , and he had an affair in England , with a dancer . That 's right . I barely knew my birth mum actually , 'cause , you know , she died like ... I was really young , and then I fell into the foster system , and then I bounced around here and there for a bit until Siobhan adopted me . - Do you remember your mom ? - It 's more like I ... have a sense of her . Like , you know , I can feel her presence , or I got this sensation . A beam of sunlight comes through the window and falls just a certain way . Hmm . Yeah , but so your mum , she knew , then ? About the affair , yeah . Yeah , not about you . That came out on his deathbed , so ... I spat in a cup for Gene-Connection . Here we are . Family science . So what does your other family think about you looking for your roots ? Your foster sister seemed like she was pretty upset . To be honest ? You know , I don 't really care . - Helena . - Sestra , you finally answered . I have news to tell you . - Yeah , sorry I haven 't been , uh ... - I am having twins . Oh ... Meathead , that 's huge . - Are you okay ? - Yes , much okay . Because I know they will always have each other . Like us . - But , sestra , can I say something ? - Yeah , yeah . I don 't want them to grow up like me . Yeah , I get that feeling . Doorbellings . I have to go . Okay . You , urn , rub that belly for me . - I will rub it . - Okay . Mrs. Hendrix ? I 'm Detective Lindstein . This is Detective Collier . Hello . We 're investigating a triple homicide at a local garage a few weeks back . Can we come in ? We just have a couple of questions , Mrs. Hendrix . It won 't take long . Yes . I will kindly offer to take your coats . No , we 're good . After examination , we were able to place the incident 12 to 24 hours before his arrival on the scene , putting it at some time during the previous day . We 're building a timeline of that day , so any details could help . Hello , husband Donald . - Some detectives are here . - Oh ! Okay . Uh ... What is this pertaining to ? Homicide , of several Portuguese . Mmm-hmm . Why don 't you join us , Mr. Hendrix ? Yeah , of course . Of course . I 'll get myself cleaned up a bit . I will continue to be hostess . Okay , honey . Uh ... Abort ! Abort ! - Heavens , Donnie , what is it ? - Police . Living room . - With Helena . - For this ? No , for Pouchy 's garage . Donnie ! Christ on a crab cake ! Get in there , Donnie . Go ! It 's from Benjamin . He might have found a doctor who can help Sarah . Oh , you want me to keep an eye on Kira ? - Is that okay ? - Yeah . - Do you mind ? - Of course . Thank you . Chicken ... I , um , I have to go out , just for a little while , but you stay here with Auntie Cosima . I 'll let you know if Benjamin 's found someone to help . Hey . Should we do a little science experiment ? Hey ' ? Kira ? Ooh , you 're exhausted , hey ? Why don 't we go make a little nap nest on the couch ? - Yeah ? - I was dreaming . - Just now ? - All the aunties were there . You set Morn on fire . You know we 'd never do that , right ? No , you had to . She was changing . - How was she changing ? - I don 't know . I couldn 't see . These were found at the scene of the crime . Oh , gosh , they were supporters . That makes this tragedy even worse . Yes , this doubles it . Can I offer you some breads ? We 're fine , thanks . The victims were known to police , but not exactly for their civic engagement . Which is a little odd , considering their interest in your wife 's campaign . Did you know the Pouzihno family ? - No . No , never met them . - No . - Did you meet them ? - No , they died . - Well , before ? - No . We 're gonna need to know who had access to your campaign materials , starting with your campaign manager . My campaign manager ? - Sarah Stubbs . - Sarah Stubbs . - That 's her name , Sarah Stubbs . - Yes . Mr. Hendrix , when we ask your wife a question , you need to let her answer . I mean , I don 't know if that 's true . Actually , I 'm just saying , legally , I don 't think that 's true . So , other than this Sarah Stubbs , who else had involvement in your campaign , Mrs. Hendrix ? Carol Lombart was coordinator , Trevor Sawatzky did transportation , and Kathy Melichi hung posters . But my biggest support was my husband . He 's my rock . - Good to see you . - Yes , thank you . Goodbye . How the hell did Helena know all that ? I don 't know . She 's a trained assassin . That 's what they do . They track people and observe things . - Oh , dear . - Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh ! - Oh ! Oh ! God ! - Oh . Oh , Jesus Christ . Oh , God ! Ugh ! Oh . Oh , come on , don 't ... - No . Ugh . - Ugh ! Oh ! - Oh , God ! - Oh ! Oh , Jesus , what is that ? What is that ? I think ... I think that 's what we need . Ira said you made Susan lose her temper . Yes . I shouldn 't have , but I did . We all need to work harder at being a family . - How are your online courses ? - Fine . - Are you still studying geology ? - Yes . I 'm learning about magma , how it explodes up from the molten core and goes sizzling into the sea . - Magma has always been here , you know . - Has it really ? It 's older than us . Older than dinosaurs . Then magma , I suppose , is Mother Nature . Darling ? What is that ? Nothing . It happens when I cough sometimes . - Hey , what did you find ? - That my Spanish is pretty shitty . But your man , Martinez , had a local address last year until he moved back to Bogota . But check this out . Four months ago , he comes into town , stays one night , and then flies back home again . That ? A long trip for a short visit . Yeah , his credit card records show that he took a cab from his hotel room to the corner of Queen and Broadview , and then back home . That 's it . - What 's at Queen and Broadview ? - Get this . It 's a dental clinic specializing in implants . - Listen , I gotta bounce , okay ? - I 'm gonna check it out ; Art . You check in with me in about an hour , all right ? - Yeah , I will . - Okay . Marty , right ? - Yeah . - Yeah , you worked my partner 's shooting . - Union steward . - That 's right . - Art Bell ? - That 's right . But see , it 's ... It 's bugging me because ... I know that you paid her a visit at home . - Okay , yeah . - See , that doesn 't usually happen . House calls . Sometimes it does ... when I 'm personally concerned for the officer 's well-being . - You know ? - Right . Well , I appreciate that , then . - Thanks . - Okay . Cosima , we 've found something that might help Sarah . - But we need some assistance . - Right . Right , and , um ... just to give you a little background , um ... You know what ? One second Cosima . Why do we have to tell her where it came from ? Let 's just tell her we procured it . You know , maybe she 'll let it slide . She 's a scientist and a lesbian . She 's not gonna let it slide . So , uh , the thing is , a few months ago , there was an occurrence that occurred on a cold autumn night . It was very rainy . I remember that distinctly and the wipers on that car were crap , - so I was having trouble ... - Donnie . Anyway , one thing led to another , and I did shoot Dr. Leekie and bury him in the garage . - But ... But , bu ; But ... - What ? Uh , it looks like he has one of those Neolutionist things in his face . So sometimes stuff works out . - You killed Aldous Leekie ? - Boy , did I ever . Yeah . Cosima , there will be time to debate the dos and dont 's of certain decisions later . But you said you needed one of those things , and we 've gone to great lengths to find one . So do you want it or not ? - Yeah , but , uh ... - Good . Then someone with science knowledge has to come get it , because right now it 's encased in some kind of awful polyp . Okay ? Great . I 'm good . No , I 'm not good . Donnie , use a towel . Oh , my God . All done ? That 's fine . Thank you . Have a seat . Beth ? Are you crazy ? You can 't be here . Who saw you come in ? - No one . - Okay . Come , come.just ... I told you , okay ? I 'm done . No more . Uh ... I wouldn 't have come if it wasn 't important . - They know that you 're digging , Beth . - But you ... You covered for me , right ? How could you ask me that ? I just ... - I don 't wanna put you in a tough spot . - of course I covered for you . I 'm as upset about all of this as you are , but I 'm exposed here , okay ? I signed an NDA . I 've witnessed the procedures . - The procedures . - They do it on purpose , um ... They bring me in , so now I 'm just as guilty as everyone . 'Cause I stood there ... I watched . Like with Martinez ? Uh , how did you know about that ? - Alonzo Martinez came here , right ? - Look , I 'm sorry ... I 've said all that I can . You really need to go . What if I told you that they did the procedure to me ? You came to get it out . Ca " you ? Well , I can , but it 's really dangerous , Beth . But you know how to do it ? - You could do it . - Okay , wait here . Leave a message . I ' ll call you back . Benjamin , where are you ? I 'm still waiting . Somebody call for a doctor ? Ferdinand . I hope you 're better at protecting the original than your communication networks . How did you find me ? Where 's Benjamin ? He 's fine . I thought we were friends , Siobhan . You killed two of my friends , so that 'll be a no . What do you want ? Would you believe I 'm looking for love ? Well , I 'm concerned because you 're investigating Neolution tech , seeking a doctor with a certain expertise . Why ? Maybe you and I could help one another . What would you have that I would want ? You know , I know a thing or two about bots . Like how dangerous they can be . Someone in your organization has one . Kira ? Sarah ? There 's a Neo network here that does them . I know who they are . And what would you want in return ? - Hello ? - Yeah , it ? Art . Sarah 's not answering her phone . She 's with Felix . No , she 's not . She was supposed to check in an hour ago . She was investigating a dental clinic . S , I think she could be in trouble . Just finishing up a few things , but I 'll see you tomorrow , okay ? - Okay . - Good night . - Have a good night . - Bye . I 'm just , um , a little unclear on what the devices are for . Right , okay . So I 'm gonna get you to open up . Great . Okay , now this might pinch just a little bit . Okay ? Okay , good . - Mmm . - Beth , if the pain gets to be too much at any point , - I just want you to let me know . Okay ? - Mmm-hmm . - So open up . Yep . Here we go . - Mmm-hmm . - Okay . - Uh ... Does that hurt ? Okay . No , no , no . No movement . Okay ? All right . Okay . Okay , so , um , I 've penetrated the device , which now means that the slightest movement on your part will cause it to erupt . Do you understand ? Don 't , don 't nod . Uh , just blink once if you understand . Okay , if you do move , a burst of tendrils will release a fatal dose of tetrodotoxin . So , again , just need you to blink once so that you understand . Great . Beth , I am so sorry , but you really don 't know what you 're getting into here . I had to call my superiors , so ... Well , they 'll probably be here any minute . But until then , honestly , no movement . It is ... It is super critical . God . You know , when you first came sniffing around here , I had instructions . Misdirect you . Send you on your way . But nobody told me that you 'd be coming back or that you 're one of the test subjects . God , you don 't know how lucky you are to be chosen for this . Oh , thank God , they 're here . Don 't move . Sarah . What ? I can 't move . I can 't understand a word you 're saying with that thing in your mouth . Very still ... Oh . Nothing to worry about . If she 'd punctured it , you 'd already be dead . What the hell are you doing here ? Sarah , earlier today , I received some rather interesting news from Rachel . Susan Duncan is alive . What ? It 's my curse , detachment . I 've spent my whole life observing you , but I don 't know how to be with you . Because you abandoned me . Father thought Neolution murdered you , but you are Neolution . So are you . I 'm sorry , Rachel . I wanted to be your mother but it was necessary to cut the cord . You raised a CASTOR clone instead . Please be kind to Ira . CASTOR was never completely under my control , to be raised homogeneously like that . I wanted him to be different . And me ? Raised by Aldous Leekie . Sent off to boarding school . Topside ... Helsinki ? You weren 't supposed to know about Helsinki . Well , I do . - And yet , here I am . - Rachel , you are the experiment . One day , you may take over . But be patient . Recover . Everyone needs a purpose in life . Ours is all in service of the greater good . What is it , Mother ? What is our greater good ? To control human evolution , darling . To create a more perfect human being . You threw me in the middle of this shit . And now you 're just going to blow it all up . Who 's the science now , bitch ? Well I 'm in this little room all by myself and I need to ... Masturbate ? Another message ... And is she the youngest subject to develop symptoms . She is . I 'll deal with anyone to get this implant out of my face . I can 't trust you now . I think we figured out what the bots do .

 Previously on " The 100 " ... Clarke : I have a message for your leader . We 're coming for him . 250 people died in that village . I know you felt for them , but you let them burn . Not everyone . Some of them aren 't wearing Hazmat suits . Means they 're cured . The marrow treatments worked . Maya : We 're going to hide you . Not everyone here agrees with Cage . Come with me . You 're safe now . Cage : 44 people don 't just vanish inside of a sealed bunker . They could if they had enough help . Stay alive . Be ready to fight . War is coming . [ Shouting ] [ Grunting ] [ Indistinct chatter ] Get up . It 's time to go . I told you I 'd come back for you . Come on out . Our people are marching on Mount Weather right now . Hey . It 's ok . We 're getting you out . Slow down . They just bled him . Listen to me . There 's an army inside this room , and I need you to help me get them ready to fight . Can you do that ? Good . Start with him . _ [ Others shouting , moaning ] Bellamy : Too much noise . _ Echo : Ok . How do we do this ? There 's an army outside going for the main door . When they get it open , all hell will break loose . That is the signal for my friends to come here , and ... [ P.A. feeds back ] Cage : My fellow citizens , this is your president speaking . I have news to share with you that will change all of our lives forever . For 97 years , Mount Weather has been our home . It 's kept us alive , but it has also held us captive . Most of us have made peace with what we 've had to do to survive . We 've done these things for one reason ... so that our people could someday return to the ground . That day is today . He 's going public . Before my friend Lorelai Tsing was murdered by the outsiders still at large in this mountain , she found a cure . It was in their bone marrow . Here . I 'll be back . Where are you going ? He 's trying to get his people to turn on each other . They 'll find my friends . I have to bring them here now . I 'll send them in groups . You get your people ready to go , but you wait for me to come back , do you understand ? Wait ! Thank you . You free your people . Protect mine when they get here . We can thank each other when we 're all outside . Cage : This has been the dream of our people since the bombs , but to reach it now , I need your help . The 44 criminals that irradiated level 5 , killing 15 of our people , are now keeping us from that dream . Although we 've repaired our home , we can never replace the lives that were so viciously taken from us , and as hard as it is to believe , there are those among us who would help the people who did this , and I am speaking to you now . If you truly want to end the blood treatments once and for all , then the 44 murderers you 're now hiding are the key to doing that . You have one hour to turn them in without punishment . After that , we 'll be forced to consider you enemies of the state . I 'm asking you , please do what 's right for your people , our people , so that we can all take our rightful place on the ground . We 're almost home . What are they doing ? Preparing to attack . They 're too close for missiles , Sir , and without the veil , there is nothing we can do from the inside . All ground units are ready to engage on your command . Not yet . Sir , the longer we wait ... They came looking for a fight , Emerson . Doesn 't mean we need to give them one . As long as we 're behind the doors , they can 't touch us . And what about the intruder ? He is still at large , Sir . We 're doing everything we can ... 45 ! Go door to door ! Find them . Yes ? Step aside , please . Why ? What 's wrong ? We 'll just be a moment . If you tell us what you 're looking for , maybe we can help you . Solider : You know what we 're looking for . Honestly , we don 't know . Soldier : According to your neighbors , you 've been bringing extra food home after meals . That 's not true . Is it true that you 've refused treatment 12 times in the past 15 years or that you 've refused them 30 times ? Do you deny that ? We take the blood when we need it . We don 't take extra food . Then you 've got nothing to worry about . Where are they ? Just hold it ! You have 5 seconds to cooperate ! 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... Please . Don 't do this ! 4 ... 5 ! Wait , wait ! Wait . Please don 't shoot . We 're here , ok ? Just leave them alone . - I 'm so sorry . - This is Tilling . Just found two more . We 're bringing them in now . Aah ! Lexa : Welcome , Sky Crew . Join us . A package from Raven . Hydrazine . She said it would do the job . Good . And , uh , your mother wanted to be here , too . I know , but the wounded in Tondc need her more . Field commanders , today 's the day we get our people back . The enemy thinks it 's safe behind its doors , but it 's not . When it realizes that , it will fight back ... Hard . We need to be ready . This is a rescue mission . We are not here to wipe them out . There are people inside that mountain that have helped us , children who have nothing to do with this war . We kill their soldiers , their leadership if we have to , but we are there to rescue our people . Is that clear ? [ Indistinct chatter ] Then let 's begin . There are 4 teams . Two of them ... at the dam and in the mine ... are moving into position already . The third ... inside the mountain ... is freeing the Grounder prisoners as we speak . It is our job as the fourth team to keep the eyes of the enemy off of them for as long as possible . To do that , we have to be in position here at the main door with our entire army . The mountain men believe the door can 't be opened from the outside , so they leave it unguarded . Only it can be , and thanks to our source on the inside , now we know how . According to Maya , the electromagnetic locking system has one flaw . When the power goes out , it disengages . That 's where Raven 's team comes in . The mountain 's electricity is generated at Philpott Dam . [ Clank ] Clarke : By now , they 've taken the turbine room . Go cover the door . Wick : You sure he 's alone ? Clarke : It 's their job to blow the power . Once they do , we blow the lock . There is a catch , a backup generator inside the mountain . If the lock is still functioning when that backup power kicks in , we 'll never get that door open , we 'll never get our people back . How much time do we have until the backup power kicks in ? One minute . That 's the window . Small window . Why don 't we just take out the backup generator , too ? Bellamy 's inside . Have him do it . Leaving them without power that long would kill them all , and as I said , that 's not the mission . Besides , we lost contact with Bellamy . Monroe : What ? We did ? When ? After he took out the acid fog . Lexa : Bellamy 's a warrior . He 'll be fine . As the commander said , once the door is open , the shooting will start , and they 'll throw everything they have at us , but that 's what we want . We want them looking at us because while we 're fighting at the front door , Indra 's team will be escorting the prisoners out the back , right through the reaper tunnels . Once all our people are free , they 'll sound the retreat . We 'll be back home before Mount Weather even knows they 're gone , and that 's it . That 's the plan . [ Indistinct chatter ] The mountain has cast a shadow over these woods for too long . They 've hunted us , controlled us , turned us into monsters . That ends today . Thanks to our alliance with the Sky People , the mountain will fall . As Clarke said , we spare the innocent . As for the guilty ... _ [ Grounders chanting , " Jus dren just daun ! " ] Jus dren jus daun ! Jus dren jus daun ! [ Chanting continues ] [ Chanting , " Jus dren just daun ! " ] Out of the way , Vincent . That 's my daughter . Dad , don 't . Quiet . She 's been aiding and abetting the outsiders . You need to get out of our way . I won 't let you take her , Paul . Listen carefully . We 've got orders . She knows where they 're hiding . Now step aside . I 'm not gonna ask you again . If you want her , you got to go through me . Dad , please . They 'll kill you . Don 't make me do this , Vincent . Sorry , Paul . [ Maya crying ] [ Gunshot ] Hyah ! [ Groaning ] Hey . Good job . Thank you . Bellamy : Miller , you ok ? Better than him . Need to get everyone into the harvest chamber . You 'll be safer there . Safe in the harvest chamber ? Just trust me . Are the others there ? Not yet . Monty ? Monty 's with the other group on level 3 . Don 't worry . We moved him after the last sweep . You should go there next . All right . Go on . Vincent will take you . I won 't be long . Hey ! I 'm coming with you . - Jasper . - I promised I 'd protect them . That 's exactly what I 'm gonna do . Let 's go . Maya . I 'll be ok . Your mother would be so proud . See you soon . Be careful . You , too . Let 's go . Come on , come on , come on . According to Lincoln 's map , we 're getting close . It 's a maze . Lincoln should be here to show us the way . He wasn 't ready . Even he knew that . He 'll do well fighting with the commander . It meant a lot that you forgave him . He earned that . I have known Lincoln since he was a boy . He always questioned our ways , but if he ever chooses sides against the clan again , not even his bravery can save him . [ Clatter ] Octavia : Stop shooting ! Reapers are not the enemy ! We don 't kill them unless we ... [ Reapers shouting ] Now ! [ Playing high-pitched tone ] Jackson : Tranquilize them . Go for the jugular ! Octavia : Secure their hands and feet . Jackson : Well done . They 'll be out for a while . [ Tone stops ] We 'll come back for them . You know him ? He 'll be ok now . Abby will help him . Let 's go . We have to find that door . That should do it . Bombs away . Be careful . Archers , watch the trees . Hey . You can do this . What if we 're too late ? What if we 're not ? Draw strength from your son . This mountain has taken too much from both of us , hasn 't it ? [ Beep ] Raven : 3 down , 2 to go . As soon as I 'm done , you set the detonator . I know the plan , Raven . It 's my plan . Fine . Jeez . You can tell me a damn joke already . Get it ? " Dam " joke ? I got it . Your jokes are terrible . They are not . They are . Now concentrate . We don 't have all day . I think I liked you better before we had sex . Right back at you . They can 't leave if you push them away first , right ? How 's that working out for you so far ? I 'll get started on number 5 . Woman on radio : 402 , please report . Over . Where did that come from ? Whose is it ? 402 , please report . Over . Raven : Wick , watch out ! This is 402 . We got intruders in the dam ! Woman on radio : Come again , 402 . Did you say intruders ? 402 , are you there ? Backup is on the way . They know we 're here . Wick , they 're sending backup . We have to do this fast . Welcome to the ground . Give me the last bomb . What happens if we only blow up 4 of the 5 ? The power stays on , door stays locked , everyone we care about dies . [ Door opens ] I had them prepare your favorite . Come on , Dad . They tell me you haven 't eaten in two days . How bad is it ? We both know you aren 't here to bring me dinner . It 's bad . They 're going after our power . I sent a team out to the dam , but there is an army outside of our main door , and they 're drilling into it . They must know that there 's a delay . I underestimated the commander . Is that what you need me to say ? It wasn 't the commander . It was Clarke . Dad . You 've killed us . One week in office , and you 've managed to turn neighbor against neighbor , you 've made the outsiders hate us more than they already did , you 've lost our outer defenses , and now a door that hasn 't been breached in 97 years is going to fall , and an army of savages is going to flood these halls , killing every last one of us . Tell me how to stop it . Please . I need your help . Your people need your help . They 'll destroy everything . You already have . Wait . Wick , stop . I 'm not doing anything . Exactly . Hey . I 'm not the one that didn 't make enough bombs . 5 turbines , 5 bombs . Maybe if you didn 't drop the last one ... oh , any engineer worth his salt knows to plan for failure . Two is one , one is none . It 's called ... Both : Redundancy . That 's it . Redundancy . That ... that ... that 's it ! Whoa ! What is ? What are you doing ? The built more turbines than they needed . We blow the other 4 , this won 't take a load . Surge protectors will ramp it down to keep it running ... To keep it from blowing up . Yeah . We need to shut down this turbine , Wick . Catastrophic failure ? That 's your plan ? Ok . When you say it like that , it doesn 't sound like such a good idea . I 'll set the detonators . It 's taking too long . It takes as long as it takes . What will you do when it 's over ? I have no idea . Well , what do you want ? Nothing . My people back . I can 't think past today . You should come with me to the capital . Polis will change the way you think about us . You already have . [ Gunfire ] Lincoln : It 's coming from the dam . They know we 're going for the power . They know we 're going for the door . [ Speaking Grounder ] Raven will get it done . She 's one of us . David : As soon as those lights go off , you push that button . We 'll do the rest . [ Gunfire ] Today , Wick ! I 'm moving as fast as I ... [ men shouting ] Actually , I can go faster . Did you get it done ? Push the damn button , Raven ! It 's working ! We 're too close . Wick ! Man : Freeze ! Hands up ! Don 't move ! Show me your hands ! Just keep backing up . Stop moving right now . We 're still too close . Not as close as they are . [ Turbine whirring faster , thumping ] Get down ! Ok , Emerson . They got the power . Start the clock . One minute . Emerson : Copy that . Don 't worry , Sir . They 're not getting anywhere near that door . [ Indistinct chatter ] She did it . One minute starting now . For those we 've lost ... And those we 'll soon find . What 's wrong ? Why isn 't it working ? They 're jamming us . I have to get closer . [ Gunfire ] Clarke ! David : 45 seconds ! _ If I can get there , I can trigger it manually . No . You can 't get there . For Nate , I have to try . _ [ Speaking Grounder ] 30 seconds ! [ Gunfire ] Aah ! We 'll find another way in . There is no other way in . You know that . We don 't need one . 10 seconds . Clarke : 5 seconds . 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Ha ha ! It worked ! We need to get to that ridge and take out the shooters . No ! You stay with Clarke . When the shooting stops , you get that door open . _ [ Gunfire ] We don 't have much time . The last 12 are on this level . Including Monty . Which way ? This way . Man on P.A. : Attention . Class one quarantine protocols are now in effect . All citizens must report to level 5 immediately . Hard seal lockdown in T-minus 30 minutes and counting . Listen to me . It 's gonna be ok . All right ? You 're gonna be ok . We 're not gonna let anything happen to you , will we ? Jasper , in 30 minutes , all backup power gets diverted for species continuity . That means level 5 for life support and security . Radiation will seep in everywhere else . I can 't go to level 5 without being shot in the head . Guys , we need to keep moving . We 'll get you your Hazmat suit , extra oxygen , enough to last until the engineers get the power back on . And then what ? You think Cage Wallace is gonna let me live here after that ? Man on P.A. : Attention . Class one quarantine protocols are now ... Then we kill him . Man on P.A. : All citizens must report to level 5 immediately . Hard seal lockdown in T-minus ... [ Gunshot ] [ Woman screams ] Monty . Man : Move ! You heard him . Let 's go . Slow , slow . Be ready for anything . It 's Mrs. Ryan . She was hiding the last 12 . Where 'd they take them ? It 's got to be level 5 . No . Get out of my way . Every person inside this mountain is on level 5 , every soldier . Tell him . Jasper 's right . After the lockdown , it 'll be almost impossible to get them out . It 's now or never . All right , but how do we even get ... [ thump ] Monty . What is it ? What 's wrong ? They know about the Grounders . That 's why I hid . I ... I didn 't do anything to save the others . I let them kill Mrs. Ryan . What do you mean they know about the Grounders ? It was on a soldier 's walkie . They 're going for the harvest chamber . If they take it , we lose everyone . Man on P.A. : Attention . Class one quarantine ... Come on ! We found it . You found it . It appears we didn 't need Lincoln after all . Thank you . You 've done well , Octavia . _ What does that mean ? What do you think it means ? I think I want to hear you say it . You 're one of us now . Lincoln . Lexa did it . Clarke , look . [ Groaning ] Make sure he 's ok . Sergeant Miller ! They 'll be waiting just inside the door . Good . _ _ _ Train your fire on the door . Lincoln : Pull ! Pull ! Again ! Pull ! [ Cheering ] Attack now ! _ What is this ? Man : Hey , look ! They 're coming out ! They 're surrendering ? Not quite . What did you do ? What you would have done . Saved my people . Where are my people ? I 'm sorry , Clarke . They weren 't part of the deal . You made the right choice , Commander . What is this ? Your commander 's made a deal . What about prisoners from the Ark ? They 'll all be killed ... But you don 't care about that , do you ? I do care , Clarke , but I made this choice with my head and not my heart . The duty to protect my people comes first . Please don 't do this . I 'm sorry , Clarke . Commander , not like this . Let us fight . No . The deal is done . _ [ Trumpeting ] You , too . All our people withdraw . Those are the terms . They 'll be slaughtered . Let me help them . _ [ Grunting ] We will meet again . [ Horn blowing ] We 're retreating . - That can 't be right . - We have to go . Now ! Indra , wait ! They 're still in there . And our commander 's out there , under attack for all we know . I don 't trust her , not after Tondc , and neither should you . I gave you a direct order . Please . This was the plan . If we 're not here with the tone generators when they come out , Reapers will kill ... Plans change . Caris : Octavia , let 's go . I 'm not going anywhere without my brother . You are no longer my second . Octavia , please . Come home with us . I have no home . You 'll need this . Come on . No ! [ Crying ] [ Wick coughing ] Raven ? Raven . Hey . Ugh ! My arm . Ow . [ Coughs ] Hey . I 'm just saying , my brace would have held . [ Coughing ] Come on . Let 's get out of here . Agh . [ Coughing ] Kyle ... No . No way . Don 't even say it . I 'm not going anywhere without you . What I was gonna say is ... Please don 't leave me . Not a chance . [ Man shouting indistinctly ] Second man : There you are . TAC team 5 . Tell the president the turbines are down . Dad ? You were right . She took the deal . You 're a hero to your people . We 've won . No , we haven 't . Not yet . Peace with the savages isn 't enough to make the ground safe for us . I know . The Ark . They 'll never stop . No parent ever would . You 're right . 20 minutes ago , we picked up a small group on radar . I already have a team on the way . Looks like we 're gonna have more bone marrow . We 'll be on level 5 until the turbines are fixed . Come down when you 're ready . David , distant : Clarke , let 's go . We 'll come back with reinforcements . Clarke . Clarke , come on . It 's over . I 'm sorry . It can 't be over .

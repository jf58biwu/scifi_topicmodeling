 MILO : Previously on Childhood 's End . ROBERT LINDERBY : At least 40 cities around the world now have these vessels hovering over them . My name is Karellen . Suffering will end . Injustice will end . SIOBHAN : It 's world peace , all hold hands and sing Kumbaya . KARELLEN : This is an invasion . ( EXPLOSION ) ( SHOUTING ) Ahhh ! All right ! - Why are you here ? - KARELLEN : We need a messenger . MILO : The birthrate is soaring . We have a world that we are proud to bring children into . It 's the Golden Age of Man . Utopia . RICKY : Why did you make this room ? Why 'd you send me Annabelle ? KARELLEN : Because she is still the most important thing in your life . One day you 'll understand why I came back . And why he built the room . ELLIE : Ricky ? Karellen is not letting you move on . RACHEL : Are you stealing the Titan drives ? Private research . For 20 years the Overlords have told us precisely nothing about themselves . I 'm a guy that likes to know stuff . It 's Karellen . He 's back . Very good to see you , Ricky . He said that the Earth has a new destiny . ( GROANS ) Karellen said that there was something in the fabric of the ship . It poisoned me . Help us ! RUPERT : Karellen said that something special was coming . TOMMY : Don 't touch us ! I take it you 're the Greggsons ? Our son Tommy is having some behavioral issues . ( SCREAMING ) No ! JAKE : Tom just said the strangest thing . - Jennifer . - What ? I know what to call the baby . We need to reclaim some of what we had when we were kids . We 're not moving to New Athens . It might be good for all of us . I need to add these people to the guest list . This gentleman wants to fly me to South Africa for a job interview . The whole family 's invited . - Milo Rodricks . - Jake Greggson . MILO : Here 's my card . He 's here . - RUPERT : The Supervisor for Earth . - ( APPLAUSE ) You 're killing scientific curiosity . Your scientific curiosity would have destroyed you . The Supervisor would like to meet with you . KARELLEN : You will find a new voice inside you . ( PEOPLE GASPING ) JAKE : Tom ! Jennifer . She 's awake . No ! So , each symbol is a letter . This one is new . I recognize the pattern , Rachel . - ( SCREAMING ) - NURSE : One more . That 's it . That 's it . AMY : Jennifer . ( JENNIFER CRIES ) JAKE : Hi . Want to say hi to Mommy ? Jennifer . Hey , Jennifer . Hello , pretty girl . - ( COOING ) - Oh , hi . ( COOING ) ( NURSERY RHYME PLAYING ) MILO : When the Overlords came , they helped us put away childish notions based on greed and fear . But this is nothing compared to what they 've inspired in the younger generation . They eat better food , and breathe better air , and are enjoying the healthiest stress-free lives human beings have ever known . As a consequence , the next generation is fitter , stronger , healthier . Human 2 . 1 . Can you imagine what their children will be like ? Undoubtedly , we are evolving . So what are we evolving into ? Thank you for coming in , Mrs. Ntaga . I 'm recording infant anomalies . Uh , changes in the young children . The kind of stuff the Overlords are taking an interest in . - That 's nice for you . - ( CHUCKLES ) For your experiment , start with the juice . Sami likes his juice . Okay . Do you want some juice , Sami ? ( TABLE VIBRATING ) ( CHUCKLES ) He always wants his juice . Uh-huh . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) FEMALE ANCHOR : Mr. Halcross , it sounds like you 're talking about an armed resistance ? JERRY : That 's not correct . FEMALE ANCHOR : But you were in the military ? Yes , I was military but I 'm not anymore . You 're twisting my words . - ( RICKY PANTS ) - What we 're talking about here is sanctuary . FEMALE ANCHOR : Sanctuary from what , exactly ? JERRY : Look what 's happening in your Utopia . Look what 's happening to your beloved prophet , who , by the way , is being held together by alien Band-Aids . I 'm inviting everyone to New Athens . You 'll be safe here . FEMALE ANCHOR : Again , Jerry , safe from what ? ( GROANING ) ( SIGHS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( WHIRRING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) You seem weaker . ( SIGHS ) Yep . Well , we 've had the good times , right ? And now we pay the check . KARELLEN : The final stage has begun . I want to tell you what will happen to the world . My friend , we are not the authors of this plan . We are facilitators . Midwives , if you will , at the birth of a new evolution of man . I take it you 've never been a father . I have 24 children . ( DOG BARKING ) And we have none . I could spare you this . You don 't have to remain here . You want to spare me something ? How about you leave the both of us alone . Hey , is she okay ? Hey , are you okay ? Are you lost ? Jennifer . ( SPEAKING IN FRENCH ) Les enfants ? Qu 'est que c 'est ? ALL : Jennifer . ALL : Jennifer . Jennifer . Jennifer . Jennifer . Jennifer . Jennifer . Jennifer . Jennifer . Jennifer . Jennifer . JAKE : What the hell ? Some of these kids can move a cup . Some of them can move a car . I met a three-year-old girl who had a knack for speaking to her parents in her dreams in three languages . Their metabolic rates have accelerated and there 's undoubtedly increased electrical activity in the cerebrum . Bottom line , these are regular children with cognitive , telekinetic and psychic ability , and they 're all linked . All across the world , they are somehow ... ( DOOR CREAKS OPENS ) ... linked to one another . But it all goes back to the first one , the Greggson baby , Jennifer . She 's the key . ( PHONE BEEPS ) Hey , Jake , it 's me again . Milo . Look , I know you want to keep your family as normal as possible , but it 's gone way beyond that now . Look , I don 't know if you 're aware of this , but kids all over the world are saying the name , " Jennifer . " And I think it may have something to do with your daughter . Please , please , call me back . She shows us things . What things ? They 're new worlds , Mom . I 've not been before . She 's taking me so far away that even the Overlords haven 't seen them . All right , guys . I don 't care where your parents are . I want you out of here right now . I said right now ! AMY : Hey , sweetheart . You have a lot of new friends outside . What do they want to see you for ? I can see all of it . I see your fear . But there 's no need to be afraid . ( SOBS ) You sure about this ? We don 't need sheets . Amy , just pack what we really need . The rest we can find in New Athens . It 's okay . It 's okay . Come on . I don 't always feel like I 'm really here . You 're not always here . JENNIFER : And now we can talk like this . TOMMY : Yes . I hear you . ( VOICES WHISPERING ) ( VOICES CONTINUE WHISPERING ) Kids ! Come on , Jen . Come on . ( CAR ENGINE STARTING ) ( VOICES WHISPERING ) JENNIFER : Your mother needs comfort , Tom . AMY : Oh , my God . JERRY ON PA : Hello , there . On behalf of everyone here in the last free city on the planet , welcome to New Athens . Whoever you are , I think you 're going to fit right in . Although we have no specific immigration process , we do ask that you read and complete the introduction packs so that you can formally register . Orientation seminars are held in many sites around the city . And these will help you get settled into living life the old way . Name please ? Um , the , uh , Greggson family . ( KEYBOARD CLACKING ) ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Welcome . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( CARS HONKING ) JAKE : All right , guys , let 's go . ( PLAYING ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( ON PHONE ) Hey , Jake , it 's me again . Milo . Look , I know you want to keep your family as normal as possible , but it 's gone way beyond that now . I need to see Jennifer . We have to learn what 's happening to her . Please , please , call me back . Excuse me . I 'm sorry to bother you . Would you come with me please ? Um , what 's the problem ? Just come with me please . - Uh , sure . - You 're not in any trouble . JERRY : Mr. Greggson , welcome to New Athens . - Who are you ? - I 'm Jerry Halcross . I 'm the closest thing this place has to a mayor . JAKE : Right . I heard you on the radio . This is my wife Amy , my son Tom , and , uh , this is our daughter . - And what 's your name , sweetie ? - Jennifer . Jennifer . Seem to be hearing that name a lot . You 're obviously very special . We welcome everyone here , okay ? Maybe we can even help you . Guys , please , relax . You 're not in any trouble . I 'm here to help . Thank you , gentlemen . - Come on . - JAKE : Okay . Thank you . It really is beautiful . JERRY : Of course , the majority prefer Utopia , whatever " Utopia " really means . Can I ask you something ? The Overlords , they really leave you alone ? Well , they respect our decision not to live in their perfect world . But , do you know what happens here ? Culture returns , art , self-expression . People screen movies . They put on plays . We even have the opera . This year , it 's Don Giovanni . They wanted Karellen to cameo as the devil . Can you imagine if that happens ? Red numbers will end it . JERRY : This is me . Come on up . Wow . This is you ? You 're an artist ? Yeah . In another life I was a command sergeant . - That facility out in the desert ? - JAKE : Yeah . Spaceships came , I was out of a job . Best thing that ever happened . Aren 't you worried that the Overlords might change their minds about New Athens ? I mean , what if they try and dismantle it ? Come on , Amy . No , I 'm not . And if they did , I wouldn 't let it . This place is what I always hoped it would be . Utopia is dull , right ? I mean , to the creative mind , peace is stupefying . Look , we 're not radicals here . We 're just trying to preserve our cultural heritage . We 're just trying to achieve something , for ourselves . I believe , I hope , I pray you 're going to change here . All of you . You , too . Her name was Tilly . My daughter , my joy . She had a severe type of anemia . So unusual . I mean , we can cure almost anything . JERRY : Yes , with their interference . Tilly was getting stronger with our medicines , so ... So when she died ... " The act of dying is the act of life . " Marcus Aurelius . Tilly left the stage to applause . Jennifer will be surrounded by life . You know , real human life . I 'm hoping that it will seep into her like some sort of medicine . It 's a beautiful thought . But what if ... What if we 're wrong ? If New Athens fails ... If that day comes , I 'd rather see it burn . RICKY : You want to hold that in your left hand right here , all right ? Keep a little bit of slack in that . More towards the bottom . Bottom . Right there . Here we go . Ready ? You want to keep it at 10 o 'clock , 2 o 'clock . 10 o 'clock , 2 o 'clock . - Do I let this ... Wait , do I let this go ? - No , no , no . Hold onto that . - You holding that line ? Hold that line . - Yes , I am holding it . Okay , here we go . Keep it a straight line . The shape . They 're like shape-shifters , see ? It goes ... There 's a whale . - ELLIE : Yeah , and the ... - The whale . It 's moving . That looks like something out of , um , like a scary movie . - Now , open . - Now . Aw . Els . These are all from before the Overlords came . Yeah . You and I had Utopia before they came . Thank you . JERRY : Home sweet home . - ( KEYS JINGLING ) - JAKE : Huh ? Nice . Go , check out your rooms . AMY : Yeah . ( SIGHS ) It 's nice . Thank you . - JAKE : Really . - Anytime . Thanks . Anything you need , just let me know . TOMMY : Hey , Jennifer , come and check this out . We could make this work . Yeah . ( PHONE BEEPING ) ( PHONE BEEPING ) It 's that scientist , Milo , calling again , isn 't it ? - Yeah . - ( PHONE BEEPING ) If he wants to speak to Jennifer , we should let him . - Why ? - I don 't know . Maybe anything that can help us understand Jennifer better is a good thing , right ? ( JENNIFER LAUGHING ) Milo , hi . That 's good . Like this . JAKE : Yeah , she 's ready to go . Okay , now this won 't take long . You okay , honey ? All right , you see that ? It 's all I could find . That 's fine . I don 't like this , Milo . You 're going to have to understand that Jennifer is the conduit of a force that is affecting every kid in the world . If you start testing her , you 'll be playing with fire . Playing with fire is how we learn to master it . We 're staying in the room . It 's just a few questions . I won 't scare her . It 's not her I 'm worried about . Jennifer ? Hi . Remember me ? I want you to look into the mirror . You see into everything . I want you to see into yourself . What do you see when you look into your own eyes ? Can you tell me what you see ? Do you see our future ? Do you see , uh , the power that gave you this gift ? Please , Jennifer , just look . Can you ... Can you tell me what this means ? Jennifer , what do you see ? I see all . I am all . Come closer . ( ECHOING ) ( GASPS LOUDLY ) The end begins . MILO : Jennifer showed me this place , the rock promontory . RACHEL : Milo ? ( KEYPAD BEEPING ) MILO : And then she showed me something else , something destructive . I think the Earth could be in danger . I need to go there . - RACHEL : Where exactly ? - To their planet . To figure it out , I guess . To try and stop it . Milo , you can 't just go to their planet . Okay , look . ( SIGHS ) The next time you hand over an animal , I want to be on that ship . I mean , you can vacuum-pack me . I mean , if the monkeys and the snakes can survive , then I can , too . You know , I think you 're evolving like those kids . Your ... Your ego is becoming super advanced . How could you ask me to do this ? What do you mean ? You brought this ? My I.D. from the kids ' hospital . When I believed the girl in the next bed stole from me . It 's where we started . But where will we finish ? Hey . Together . There 's a family movie day every Saturday afternoon . I saw billboards , just up the street . Us , all together , watching a silly old movie ? Yeah , sounds good . Yeah . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) RACHEL : Please don 't go . Rachel , I ... MILO : Rachel , what I saw ... What if the world is in danger ? You said yourself , the mystery 's that girl , Jennifer . The mystery 's here . Yeah , look , you 're right . The mystery is here but the answer isn 't . It 's out there . Look , and I 've done the math . It takes the Overlords 48 days to get back to their planet . And they 'll probably just put me on a ship back , so call it 100 days , round trip . One hundred days at para-light speed is ... Eighty years here . But their ships can come and go , right ? Rachel , we know they can manipulate time . Shut up . I 'm coming back . Ah ! ( GROANS ) God ! - Is it these ? - ( SCREAMS ) Ah ! ( GASPING ) These things are useless . ( PANTING ) ( YELLS ) ( WHIMPERS ) I 'm scared . I 'm so scared , Annabelle . ( PANTING ) Annabelle ? I 'm here , sweetheart . ( KEYPAD BEEPING ) ( AIR HISSING ) That 's how we put an animal into stasis . Right . What have you got there ? Uh , yeah . Um ... ( EXHALES ) Okay . Adrenalin shot . High-concentrate steroid injection . Great , that 'll kick-start muscle action . Full-spectrum vitamin shots . Mirtazapine anti-nausea meds . Alkaline eye-hydration . Bottle of water and ... And a granola bar . We , uh , don 't know that they oxygenate the storage hangar on the ships . - Hey , hey , hey , listen . - What if you 're wrong about the ships ? ( SOBS ) You 'll be gone for 80 years . ( SOBBING ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Container prepped for stowing . Countdown , two minutes . We don 't have much time . Right . Will they run a scan or something ? RACHEL : They run a body-mass reading but she 's a big girl . You don 't add any suspicious extra weight . AUTOMATED VOICE : Pressure steady . ( BREATHING DEEPLY ) That ... That won 't help . Will I dream at least ? If you do , it 'll be a 48-day nightmare about suffocating . Fine . AUTOMATED VOICE : Prepare to transfer specimen . ( KEYPAD BEEPING ) ( EXHALES ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Overlord ship entering lower atmosphere . Don 't go . AUTOMATED VOICE : One minute until transfer . What ? - Rachel . - ( SHAKILY ) I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I know you 're scared , too . Look , if I 'm not back in 100 days , get on the Orbital . It 'll be safe there . Get yourself on the Orbital . Sleep the time away . You 'll figure it out . AUTOMATED VOICE : Overlord ship ready to receive specimen . Here . - Love , right ? It means love . - Yes . AUTOMATED VOICE : Thirty seconds until transfer . I 'm coming back . You hear me ? Okay . Okay , you swear you 'll come back , I 'll swear to wait . ( SOBS ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Standby . I swear . I swear , too . AUTOMATED VOICE : Standby . - ( INAUDIBLE ) - ( AIR HISSING ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Hibernation status satisfactory . ( WHIRRING ) ( MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY ) ( INDISTINCT TALKING ON TV ) Mmm . What time is it ? Actually , it 's the start . We 're at the very start . Of what ? The rest of our lives together . I got something for you . Oh ? ( LAUGHS ) Oh . What ? You said you wanted to see the Yankees . Oh , yeah . But hang on . Do they play here , in this room ? Because we 're not leaving this room . Not for three days . ( CHUCKLES ) That 's ... That 's good . That 's good . 'Cause this honeymoon , the Four Seasons , they might 've run out of money . ( GIGGLES ) I have a confession to make . I didn 't think that you were going to say yes when I proposed . Oh , is that what that was ? A proposal . That business with the Barry White and the red rose ? Annabelle ? When did you have these taken ? I don 't remember ... ELLIE : I 'm right beside you . Ricky . I 'm sorry you lost the love of your life . I 'm here . How 'd it get so late ? Where 'd the day go ? RICKY : " As surely as it rises , the sun also has to set . " Someone said that to me once . Even the best day in the world has to end . Never to be repeated . Switch that mind off . There 's nothing to worry about . We 're safe . Cancer . ( SIGHS ) She was so beautiful . She had a light . And finally it went out . Why are you talking like this ? This is special and we 're happy , so why spoil it ? You 're going to stay in this room with me . I begged you to stay , Annabelle . I begged you not to let your light go . But you couldn 't . I thought I 'd never love again . I thought it 'd be a sin to . KARELLEN : It doesn 't have to be like this . But it was like this . I mean , that 's how she died . KARELLEN : But it wasn 't here . I can give her back to you . I can slow down time in this place . You can stay here and never leave . If that 's what you want . It isn 't real . KARELLEN : It 's a gift , from one friend to another . The sun doesn 't have to set . Oh , just stop . Please . You put that here . Not me . RICKY : I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . ( RICKY SIGHS ) This room ... KARELLEN : Mmm-hmm ? Bury it . ELLIE : Sweetheart ? Ricky ? Baby , come back inside . - ( GASPS ) - Oh , Jesus . Els , you 're so beautiful . Let 's go inside . Let me lay here , just catch my breath . Okay . I never loved anyone more than you , Els . Never . ( BREATHING HOARSELY ) What 's that one ? ( RICKY GASPS ) It 's a two-headed rooster . ( CHUCKLES ) A two-headed rooster ? Well , that was the Frog . - The Great Frog . - The Great Frog . ( GASPS ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) ( LAUGHING ) ( ALL LAUGH ) ( PEOPLE GROAN ) JAKE : Aw ! AMY : Oh ! It 's time . People of Earth , I speak to you again , one last time . You have enjoyed decades of peace and prosperity , a Golden Age for Man . But the sun sets on even the most glorious of days . And it must now start to slowly sink into the night for you . Do not condemn us , for we were tasked by a higher mind to oversee your evolution to a higher level of consciousness . It is your destiny , and the destiny of many worlds . You have grown accustomed to our presence , but we can be your guardians no more . Thomas , sit down . Your children are no longer yours . In time , they will cease to be human . No more children will be born on Earth . ( ECHOING ) No more children will be born on Earth . No more children will be born on Earth ever again . For the adults , your future is yours to live as you please for however many days are left . My hope is that humanity will go to its rest in peace . ( SCREAMS ) My baby ! ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) - No , Jennifer ! - Jen ! - Jen ! No ! - Jen ! AMY : Jen ! JAKE : No , Jen ! - No , Jen ! - Jen , get down ! ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) Jennifer ! ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) ( WOMAN SOBS ) - No ! No ! Jennifer ! - JAKE : No ! Jennifer ! Honey ! This is not going to happen ! Tommy , no ! ( CROWD CLAMORING ) ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) Gracie ! ( SHOUTS ) ( SCREAMS ) Tommy , please , no ! - Oh , my God . - Tom , don 't leave me , buddy . Please . - Hey , Tom . - Please , don 't . Come here . Come here . Buddy . JAKE : Jerry ! AMY : Jerry ? JAKE : Jerry ! Amy ? ( AMY PANTING ) JAKE : Okay , okay . No , he 's taken it . Mom ? AMY : Jake ? ( BEEPING ) ( BEEPING CONTINUES ) JERRY : We were greedy people , and selfish , we screwed up in a big way . But we made music , we wrote books , we mapped the cosmos . JAKE : That 's right , Jerry . We 're amazing . We 're an amazing race . So let 's carry on being amazing . Let 's defy the Overlords and get our kids back . It 's not going to end . We do not end , but we can 't give up hope . There was hope . The hope we had since the beginning of mankind , the only hope there ever was . The children , Jake . The children . And they 're gone now . Maybe when we die , we 'll get a chance to be with them again . Jerry , you built something here . All of this is in defiance of them , right ? This is writing the book ourselves , so don 't let them decide the ending . Jerry ! You know , I was thinking , we 're energy , right ? Human beings are energy . When our bodies are gone , that energy has to go somewhere . Hey . TOMMY : You 're fading . What ? You 're fading . She gave me some more time to say goodbye , Mom . But it 's over now . I 'm going . JAKE : You know what human beings are ? Martin Luther King , Nelson Mandela , they keep fighting . We 'll fight to find our children and we 'll fight to bring them back . ( BEEPING CONTINUES ) Turn it off . Turn it off . - Don 't be absurd . - Turn it off ! You saw it . You saw it in their eyes . - They 're beyond us now . - Turn it off . ( BEEPING CONTINUES ) Turn it off . Ask Jennifer if you can stay here with us . You belong with us . Mom , it 's all right . I 'm joining the others . I have to go now . She 's calling me . I have to go . ( SOBBING ) JAKE : You can 't destroy this place . What does it matter what we want , Jake ? ( BEEPING CONTINUES ) We 're little men . We 're little men . AMY : Just stop . I was a little girl alone in a hospital bed and I was scared , remember ? And then I looked into your eyes , and I wasn 't scared anymore . Hey , hey . At least , we knew love . At least , we knew what it was to be a family . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . I 'm here . I 'm here . ( BEEPING CONTINUES ) - I love you . - I love you . ( EXPLOSION ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( RAPID BEEPING ) ( GASPING ) ( GASPING ) ( GASPS ) ( COUGHS ) ( PANTING ) I am is Vindarten . This be . This can be . No . This language is . I 'm new this language . But is fine and under control . Is fine and good . You are not well ... ( COUGHS ) ... hence the floor . We use your terms . And so , in your terms , we are 11 and 100 years of light away from Earth . We are orbit the 6th planet in the Carina System . This is our world , you call " Homeworld " . We can call it Jenjedda . I made it . Indeed . MILO : How long has it been ? VINDARTEN : It be 40 of your Earth years . It 's been 40 years on Earth , right ? What 's it like there now ? Interesting . You come this all way here to ask for back where you come out from . Look , I came here because I saw it . The Earth is in danger . Everything that is happen on Earth was planned long ago . Is natural . Is the cosmos . Is the Overmind . " Overmind " ? Overmind of all creation . Are you talking about God ? We have talked to the Overmind for 100,000 year . We go where it sends . We change worlds . We change Earth . The Overmind . Can you show it to me ? You really want this ? I want to know everything . It connects to the Overmind . OVERMIND : ( DISTORTED ) Step in . You 're the Overmind . OVERMIND : A faint reflection of it . I am All . Divisible , and indivisible . I am the collective consciousness of this universe . So , we are God ? OVERMIND : No , the children are God . And they have left you , as children must . And you must let them go , as parents must . Only the children can become a part of the whole . MILO : It 's an evolution . OVERMIND : Into one mind . So , we 're finished ? We cease to exist . We ... ( GASPS ) Oh , my God . ( PANTING ) I have to get back to Rachel . I need to go back . ( PANTING ) Take me back home . KARELLEN : Hello , Milo . I trust you slept well ? More comfortable than the squid , I suspect . I 'm home ? KARELLEN : It is not home anymore . Right , uh , it 's been 85 years ? While you 've been asleep , I have been learning your language . " Oh , for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention . " William Shakespeare . ( SIGHS ) What happened to the Orbital ? It happened long ago . MILO : Rachel ? We brought her here . Would you like to see her ? Yes . ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTS ) You know a lot . So , I 'm just going to ask it . Has anything of her survived beyond death ? KARELLEN : Yes . You . That 's not a consolation . Consciousness , Milo , is a community of minds . Each exists in the other 's thoughts . Rachel exists in your consciousness as if she had never left . You still love her . You still feel her . So what has changed ? She 's dead . Gone . But she once lived and you knew her . You know her still . Until I 'm gone , too . Right ? It 's all gone . Everything we built , we did . It has been the destiny of many worlds . We have overseen them all . Yeah , and what about your people , hmm ? Is this going to happen to you one day , on Jenjedda ? We have reached the end of our development . All our possibilities are exhausted . Oh , Milo . You were so flawed as a species and so passionate . You believed in so much and knew so little . I envy mankind . Your children can go where we can never follow . I miss cookie dough ice cream . You ever have it ? It 's like , the first time you try it , you 're all like , " How have I lived so long without this in my life ? " You ever come across a civilization with cookie dough ice cream ? No . We did that . Hmm . - Not bad . - Hmm . I 'm the last one . You can stay here with us . The boy who wanted to know everything can know everything after all . Thank you , but I don 't share your view , Karellen . She 's dead . And I can 't bear to live out my life as the last man . My place is out there , someone to witness this . If I went back to the Earth , I could report back what happens on the ground . - Has anybody ever done that ? - You would do that for me ? Of course . I 'm a scientist . My name was Milo Rodricks . Not that it matters anymore . I 'm ... I was an astrophysicist . I 've lived more than a lifetime and ... And I can smell Pop-Tarts . I 'm the last human being enjoying his last sensory pleasure . I got a favor to ask . Don 't forget us . We may have many faults but we don 't deserve to be forgotten . Strike my first statement . My name is Milo Rodricks , until the very last second . Until the end . ( LOUD RUMBLING ) Jennifer is , uh ... She 's drawing energy from ... Everywhere . The moon . The ground beneath me is disappearing . She 's taking everything . Oh , God ! Jennifer , you 're the last child . It 's going to end . ( SIGHS ) Karellen , I 'm scared . ( GASPING ) KARELLEN : Focus on me , Milo . Hear my voice . Don 't be afraid , it 's natural . You have nothing to fear . MILO : There 's not much time . You have to save something . Save something from the Earth . We can 't lose it all . You have to save one thing , please ! What ? Something from our culture . Okay ? It can 't be as though mankind never existed at all . Please . Please . ( BEEPS ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO ) Thank you . ( SIGHS ) ( MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING ) ( LOUD CRACKING ) ( MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING ) It is done . ( MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING ) VINDARTEN : What do we do with it ?

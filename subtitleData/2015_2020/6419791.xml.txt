 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... We need to find Skye . HYDRA 's new heads ... Strucker and List . They 're researching powered people . We 're making a deal ... with Ward . We are working with Director Coulson . - You 're gonna do whatever he says . - I 'm more than happy to comply . I 'll have him taken away from here . Just let me go with him . I 'll talk to him . I 'll soften the blow . I see what 's happening . You were gonna dump me here like yesterday 's trash . - Skye ? - Coulson ? - I need to get you out of here . - No , no , not yet ! Don 't go ! Damn it ! I had her . Deathlok 's down . HYDRA 's storming the building . - Your call , boss . - Take me to your leader . 2x19 - " The Dirty Half Dozen " What are ... Were you watching me ? I didn 't mean to startle you . I heard you calling out . - I was asleep . - Yes . And dreaming . Do you want to tell me about it ? Lincoln said you 'd been having nightmares . Lincoln ... he was actually in this dream , being held somewhere , being hurt . It felt ... real . Excuse me . Where 's my wife ? ! Ahh ! Didn 't expect to see me back here so soon , did you , my love ? Not after such a well-planned banishing ! - Where 's Lincoln ? - You took me from my home ! - All right , that 's enough ! - Cal , this isn 't your home . - I know that now . - Hey ! Lincoln is still out there . Gordon , can you please ? - What happened ? - There was an attack . Can we please get back to what matters here ? You tried to take me away from our daughter . It 's unacceptable ! Go calm down , Cal . You and I can discuss this later . There are worse options . - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . But Coulson was there . It was HYDRA . I tried stopping them . I barely got away . They took Lincoln . Robert . It 's good to see you . - Is it ? - Okay . It 's good to see my bus , but , hey , you look well , too . Why turn yourself in now , Phil ? Strucker and List have been running experiments on enhanced people . They 've set up a base in the Arctic . I have a man on the inside who fed us their location . - I can 't trust you . - Then trust the mission . Robert , don 't let this be about you and me . The one thing we still have ... both of us ... is stopping HYDRA . - Don 't we ? - What 's your proof ? Firsthand ... List took Mr. Peterson . Deathlok , the thing HYDRA created . Mike Peterson , an ally . He 's been working for me . - This is not helping your case . - We have a chance to hit HYDRA ... hard . They 're operating on powered people . - We can shut that down and save lives . - Perhaps , but I 'm gonna ask again ... - why should I trust you ? - Because we all have our secrets . You have one sitting in the cargo hold of your ship , but I 'm still willing to work with you . How do you know that ? Because it 's in this box , which I will open for you if you trust me . I don 't understand . - Why was Lincoln there ? - Because of me . I asked him to go and protect you , to keep you safe . It was a mistake . I should never have let you go at all . It was the right thing to do . We have to make sure that the Cal that we put out into the world is the same Cal that I 've seen here ... th-the safe and user-friendly Cal . You were trying to make it easy on him . You were being compassionate . - How do we get Lincoln back ? - We don 't . - It 's too much of a risk . - You don ... You don 't understand . They will torture him . They will kill him . I know exactly what HYDRA is capable of doing . I 've carried the memory of what they did for decades . I 'm sorry . And I wish I could save Lincoln from that , but I suspect somehow HYDRA is tracking Gordon 's movements . Anyone I send will be at risk , too . And Lincoln wouldn 't want me to . These people are important to him . He wouldn 't want them to risk their lives . We can 't rescue Lincoln ... not now . I 'm sorry . - What the hell ? - Welcome back . - Who 's there ? - We didn 't get to formally meet . My name 's Mike . I think we got knocked out together . You 're the guy with the parts . - You know where we are ? - No . At least they haven 't killed us yet . - But there are bodies out there . - Oh , great . You got all that hardware . Use one of those weapons and get us out of here . Right . Because I didn 't think of that . At least your sarcasm still works . They disabled the arm . It 's dead . What about that teleporting guy ? - He coming to help us out ? - I hope not . I think they 're tracking him . He 'd put all my people at risk . Yeah . My people are just as outmatched . Only they 're stupid enough to try it . So if we want out of here , we got to do it ourselves . I 'm Lincoln . Thank you , doctor . Hail HYDRA . Well , Strucker 's most pleased with our progress . And he 's very anxious to see the subjects with his own eyes . They are an interesting contrast , these two . This one , the one they call Deathlok ... his modifications are mechanical , bestowed by science , by man . - And the other ? - His oddities are intrinsic , somehow bestowed upon him by nature . Yes . But knowing the difference is not the same thing as re-creating it . - And to that end , I hope to ... - To isolate the genetic component , yes . A comparison between the two could be invaluable . Dr. Whitehall believed discovery requires experimentation . - I do miss him . - As do I. But the world moves on , and we form new allegiances . I 'm very glad to hear that ... especially as we proceed with the experimentation . Here we go . That 's your plan ? I take it from your expression , you 're not dazzled . Why send a small infiltration unit ? Why not a full-on assault ? Blow the base to particles . I 'd rather not sacrifice the prisoners . Rescue is ideal . We don 't even know how many people HYDRA 's holding . I 'm not sure I 'm willing to put my people at risk . You don 't have to . I 've already got my own people picked out . - How you feeling ? - Nauseous . Mm . You want me to get ... Oh , no , not from getting shot . That 's nothing . It 's those two . I think they actually ... like each other . Just , um , just focus on your wound . It 'll be less unsettling . You want to take the stick ? I could teach you . Come on . I think you 'd like to fly . No . No . If I fly , I 'm taking us to Mykonos or Kauai . - So , you don 't like our plan ? - Grant , SHIELD makes me nervous . Didn 't you already fulfill your promise to Coulson ? But not my promise to you . There 's still one more thing I need from him before this is over . Yeah . Green light ! Go ! - Agent May . - Sir . - Welcome back . - Nice to be back . You 'll be accompanied by guards at all times . Each of whom will shoot you without hesitation . - Remember that . - May 's actually pretty friendly ... once you get to know her . Gentlemen ... You finally come back , and you bring Grant Ward onto the base . - I hope this plan of yours works . - You and me both . This video feed was streamed from Deathlok 's eye less than an hour ago . What happened ? - It appears HYDRA removed his eye . - Well , we 've got a problem . Without Deathlok 's feed , we don 't have eyes on the ground . Not true . I have a man working on the inside ... Sunil Bakshi . I know Bakshi . He 's a HYDRA agent . Not anymore . Now he works for me . - Says the HYDRA agent . - My days with HYDRA are over . Just an independent contractor trying to make amends . We remain skeptical . With good cause , but I believe using Bakshi is the only way for us to successfully infiltrate this base . The base is in the Arctic circle with nothing around for miles . HYDRA will see us coming . Which is why it 's critical I take in a small team . And just to be clear , Agent Coulson , what is your objective here ? We rescue the enhanced prisoners , then disable the missile-defense system so that SHIELD jets can fly in safely to bomb the facility . You really believe a small team can do this ? My team can . Then I suppose we should put this matter to a vote . - Agent Morse . - I 'm in . Agents Weaver and Oliver . - No . Too risky . - I agree . Understood . But I 'm voting to go ahead with this . That leaves you with the deciding vote , Agent May . I 'd like a word in private with Agent Coulson first . You look upset . - Is everything okay ? - I feel sorry for her . Yeah , well , should 've seen her back on the plane with Ward . Seems the two of them are in love with each other . - Whatever that is , it 's not love . - No . Of course not . Hey , thank you for packing the sandwich before I left . - It was really delicious . - Oh . You 're quite welcome . But I just don 't understand why Coulson would take Ward on a mission . - It 's simply too dangerous ! - Yeah . For Ward , maybe . I attacked him back on the Quinjet . Hunter had to pull me off him , so ... - Really ? - Yeah , yeah . Lucky for him . You know , what I should 've done is tossed him from the plane . Yeah , that would 've been fitting , but perhaps there 's a better way still . Splinter bombs . Simply find Ward alone , stick one of these on , and poof ... no more Ward . Yeah , that probably would be quite a fitting way for , um ... Wait . You 're serious . Ward is a threat to every agent working in SHIELD . Isn 't it our responsibility to at least arm ourselves against him ? What the hell are you thinking ? I could ask you the same thing . Since when did you become a high-ranking member of Team Gonzales ? Someone had to run the base while you were gone . Having a seat allowed me to keep you safe . - I was fine on my own . - Seems that 's how you operate best . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? That you 've been lying to me ever since SHIELD fell . All those overseas trips you were taking , they were never about recruiting new agents , were they ? You want to tell me what Theta Protocol is ? - No . - Because you don 't trust me . Because you 're not the Director of SHIELD . Neither are you ! Not anymore . We 've always had our secrets , May . You had a secret line to Fury behind my back . This ... is personal . - This is about Andrew . - He 's my ex-husband . And you were working with him ... behind my back ! I went to him for counseling . He was the only therapist I could talk to about my alien-writing impulses . - You should 've told me . - You 're right . I should have , and I will apologize to you later , at length . But right now , List has Mike Peterson and who knows how many other enhanced prisoners . Now can we put this behind us and go rescue them ? Please ? What part of " no " didn 't you understand ? The part where you won 't take me to Lincoln . I told you , no one enters or leaves Afterlife - until we know it 's safe . - It 'll be too late by then . SHIELD may be wrong about a lot of things , but they never leave a man behind . - I 'm sorry ... - Don 't give up hope just yet . Skye can save Lincoln . I saw her do it . - Wh ... You 've seen it ? - We think Raina 's gift may allow her to see things before they happen . I thought her gift was spinning really fast - to collect gold rings . - Tell me what you saw . Maybe she 's right . What I saw doesn 't make much sense . Why would Coulson be working with Ward ? C-Coulson and Ward were together back at Cal 's office , - but I didn 't ... tell anyone . - You have to go . - You do go . - Go where ? Lincoln 's in a dark room with two doctors . They 're cutting into him . You find him . - You 're the only one who can save him . - You have to take me . I promised Jiaying I wouldn 't use my gift . You need permission to save a friend ? Last time I went back for Lincoln , HYDRA almost captured me . How will this be any different ? Because where you take Skye is a long way from HYDRA . - You 're taking this too far . - It 's the only way we can move forward . I 'll go help my team while you stay here and reconnect with your past . That made sense when it was just calling my mom . This is something else entirely . Listen , you 're a SHIELD agent , Kara . I was a SHIELD agent ... a long time ago ... before HYDRA took me ... before I met you . Being a SHIELD agent was taken from you . This is your chance to get that part of yourself back . And I 'll keep saying it until you believe me . All you have to do is stay strong . If you didn 't want me to go , then why did you vote to allow it ? Because Coulson 's only using his own people . Figured it was worth the risk . Those are SHIELD agents going on that mission , Robert . I 'm aware of that , Agent Morse . We 're fighting a war with an enemy that is without honor . Sometimes , we make sacrifices for the greater good . Excuse me , sir , but I 'd like to join the mission . I appreciate the offer , Agent Simmons , but this is a specialized team . Agent May is there for tactical support , Fitz to disable the defense systems ... And who 's there to look after Mike 's injuries ? Ward ? HYDRA 's already removed Mike 's eye . God knows what else they 've done to him . He 'll need a doctor , and preferably one already familiar with Deathlok 's anatomical structure . - You sure about this ? - Absolutely . - This is something I have to do . - Suit up . - What was that ? - On your knees , now ! - May , it wasn 't me . - Then what the hell was it ? - Skye . - Hey , guys . This is great . We finally got the team back together . How are they all ? Are you making friends ? How did you get the intel about the base ? - Can you control your powers , or ... ? - Yes . Yes , I-I promise I will tell you guys everything . It 's a lot . You might not believe me , but just not now . Well , we 're just happy to see you , and you 're being so secretive . No , I 'm happy to see you , too , but ... Yeah , we 've got a mission to do , not much time , - blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . - No , Ward is here . I don 't want to talk about anything personal - in case he 's just ... - Did I hear my name ? - He 's like candyman . - We should review the op . - Ward ... - Mhm ? ... can 't believe I 'm saying this ... - ... bring us up to speed on Bakshi 's intel . - All right . Bakshi 's using old HYDRA text channels to provide us with intel , although m ... much of it is , uh ... much ... All right . Can we just address the elephant on the plane ? I know . This is weird . - Mistakes were made . - By you . - And people got hurt . - By you . And I could stand here and explain again how my parents - and brother left me vulnerable ... - We all had our traumas , Ward . Didn 't turn any of us into psychopaths . Well , we all have our own ways of coping , don 't we ? - For example , I was yours . - Watch it , Ward ! Look , I 'm just saying we all made mistakes . Coulson handed me over to my abuser ... thank you . - Skye shot me ... - After you killed how many people ? Yeah , and we were a team and a family , and you betrayed us ! I know . It 's what I regret the most . Not the lying , the SHIELD agents I had to put down , and ... I 'm sorry ... not even dropping you two in the ocean . It 's this . My actions destroyed this . I 'll regret that forever . 'Cause there were good times . Right ? Before ? I mean , for a while there , we were a good team . Weren 't we ? - I 'm still happy I shot you . - Yeah , me too . Should 've aimed for the face . - Yeah . - Guys ... I know this is so weird , but we have to come back to the mission . Two teams . Skye , Ward , and Simmons on rescue and medical . Fitz and I will break in to missile defense and gather intel . - May 's with us for firepower . - Wait . You 're not on rescue ? Let me handle the job assignments . The point is , there 's a lot of challenges ahead . We don 't want to implode before we even get there . And , Ward , just ... no more talking ... to people . You 've been pacing , haven 't you ? - Why would you assume ... - Come with me . I shouldn 't have come back so hot . I didn 't count to 10 . I ... I am better . I promise . I 'm sorry . It wasn 't right to send you away , certainly not without telling you . - Probably not at all . - I understand . Actually , you know , I don 't . I-I don 't understand . Why did you send me away ? Everything is so dangerous right now . - I felt I had to . I ... - You had that thing you 've got ... butterflies in the stomach , except in the heart . - You were stressed . - Why don 't you stay for now ? We can let everything calm down , and then we can figure it out . Thank you , thank you . You know , I-I was pacing a little . - I don 't want to lie . - It 's okay . It really will be the three of us together , just like we wanted . There are always threats . - What can you tell me about her ? - Raina ? She 's manipulative , dangerous , deceitful . We had good times . You need to watch her . What are you doing ? Not everyone is gonna be able to see the mission in real-time ... in Coulson 's ... in the office . So I figure the rest could watch here . - If you don 't want my help ... - No , no , no . It 's ... It 's cool . Thanks . I 'm sorry , man . For everything . I did what I thought was right . I still do , but I ... I never meant for you to get hurt . I get it . It 's the line of work . You had a tough call to make . I maybe wish you 'd chained me up somewhere - not in a men 's restroom , but ... - I swear I looked for any other place ... The point is , Mack ... I forgive you . R-Really ? Thanks . Look , I promise you , when everything settles down around here , next round of drinks is on me . - A round of drinks ? Really ? - Mhm . You choked me out and kidnapped me . A round of drinks is the first thing in a long , long , long list of things you 're gonna do for me . - Okay ... All right . - All right ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? Whatever it takes . - You talk to Bobbi yet ? - No , not yet . It 's funny . Don 't mind blood , but needles ? - Not a fan . - I 'm trying not to look at any of it , but this isn 't really about tests , right ? This is you guys keeping an eye on me where I can 't leave . Better than a cell , I guess . Plus , we want to make sure they didn 't mess with you physically . - Just ... - Messed with my head . I know . How much do you remember ? From before ? Pieces , missing some details . You know , you and I actually met a few times . So I 'm here for you . If you start remembering , come to me . I 'll help you out . Thank you . You 're the first one here to speak to me like a person . What Whitehall did to you ... it 's unthinkable . Yeah . But at least one good thing came out of it . I met Grant . No , just wait . He 'll get Bakshi to help . You 'll see the Grant I do . I doubt they 'll survive . That 's a crushing disappointment , really . No one has made it past this stage of our experiments with alien enhancement . Well , no one other than the twins , of course . And Strucker has them in Segovia . Oh , it would be so nice if they were not our only viable subjects . Well , perhaps he will prove the answer . - He 's due in surgery about now . - Dr. List . A cloaked plane is on approach . Cloaked ? But how can you see it ? It 's the barren location . We see a blip , even a cloaked one . It must be SHIELD . - Shoot them out of the sky . - Yes , sir . We 've been spotted . It 's time . I 've got visuals on the target . Buckle in . They 've locked on . Satellite confirms that SHIELD 616 has been hit . Any contact from Coulson 's team ? I 'm afraid not . Sit tight . This was always the plan . I 'm starting to think this wasn 't a very good plan ! Is there anything you can do about the drop ? ! Not if we want HYDRA to believe we 're debris ! I 'm really starting to wish I hadn 't eaten that hot pocket earlier . Hold on ! SHIELD 218 has eased its decent and is making preparations to land . That was the easy part . Clear . - I was being followed . - Calm your mind , Bakshi . Your compliance will be rewarded . It 's good to see you again , Sir . Where 's Kara ? Exactly where she needs to be . - Is List still here ? - Yes , sir . In the lab , along with the other prisoners . - And the mainframe room ? - Down the hall , to the left . Everyone clear on their team 's objective ? If it 's agreeable , I 'd prefer to join Agent Ward 's team . - Is that gonna be a problem ? - Hardly . Remember , just 15 minutes till Gonzales ' jets arrive . Move . Be careful , Jemma . - Dr.List ! - Get me out of here ! - Just like old times , huh ? - Not exactly . So that 's what happened in Puerto Rico . The least you can do is thank me . How about I just don 't try to kill you again ? - It 's not as bad as it looks . - Really ? - No . It 's pretty bad . - There 's another guy in here . - He had electrical powers . - Lincoln ? - Yeah . - They moved him just before you showed . You need to hurry . The guy 's in pretty bad shape . We 're coming in . You 're up . Don 't just stand there like an idiot . Go and find something we can carry him out on . Surprised you 'd sign up for any mission with Ward involved . I saw an opportunity to do the right thing , so I took it . Lincoln ... Lincoln , wake up . Oh , my god . Raina was right . Sir , watch out ! We 're on the same team . - What were you thinking ? - That I made you a promise . What ? That you would kill me ? - I thought we moved past that . - Go on . Get it over with , you monster . You really have changed , Simmons . I 'm disappointed in you . - Okay , missile defenses are almost down . - Good . Where 's Coulson ? SHIELD jets are five minutes from the target . Have them await my command . - Any word from Coulson 's team ? - Not yet . Get out of there , Phil . - Hey , need to move . - Just one minute . Come on , Phil , this wasn 't the plan . Or was it ? Either come with me now , or you 're next . Okay . After you . - Is he okay ? - Where are Ward and Bakshi ? They 're not coming with us . Okay . Come on . We don 't have much time . This is SHIELD 218 . We have the prisoners and are leaving HYDRA airspace . Whew . Well done , Coulson . Agent Weaver , have our jets fire when ready . Be careful ! Hello ? Sounds like you made it out okay . I 'm surprised you didn 't join us . I thought it might be in my best interest to find an exit that wouldn 't , oh , land me in a cell afterwards . Or , you know , my brain erased . Well , I 'm glad you made it out all right . Yeah , we both know that 's not true , Coulson . You want to tell me what this call 's really about ? I always knew the team wasn 't gonna forgive me . Some people just don 't deserve forgiveness . But Kara ? She does . That 's why I 've returned her to SHIELD . - Ward , there 's ... - She was a good agent ... a good person . Then HYDRA ambushed her safe house and took that from her ... took everything . Whitehall broke her , and I 've tried to fix her , but I 'm just not the right man for it . Just not enough good left inside me . - She deserves better . - I 'll see what I can do . I know you 'll do the right thing . HYDRA didn 't just disconnect your leg . - It 's , like ... - They dismantled it . It 'll take serious man-hours to reattach it . I wish I had the equipment to fix it here . - Just tell me someone does . - There 's a facility . We 've already gotten in touch , so they 'll be ready for you straightaway . - How 'd you guys find us , anyway ? - Bakshi , if you can believe it . Ward got him to lead us right in . Yeah ? I didn 't see Bakshi . What happened to him ? He didn 't make it . Come on , Lincoln . Wake up . Sir , the attack team 's on their way back . They report the entire HYDRA base has been destroyed . - Good . - There was no sign of this Dr. List . He may have escaped . Sir ? Are you ... Are you okay ? She 's still dangerous . - We 're all dangerous . - But it 's okay . She 's in our custody , and we got what we wanted . - What we wanted ? - Enhanced people here on the base . That 's why you were willing to go along with Coulson 's plan . You wanted the enhanced people he 'd rescue . I didn 't expect Skye , but we have her and one of her friends . Maybe we can learn how many are out there . - You 're gonna hold Skye here ? - Of course I am . - I think that we need to discuss this . - Discuss what ? - What are we discussing now ? - Time to honor our agreement . Here you go . Unlocked and all yours . Go nuts . At least until Fury shows up and asks for it back . Oh . Spoiler alert . Oh . Hey . I have to take this . Hi . Can you hang on a second ? I bet Gonzales wasn 't happy when you said he wasn 't invited to this chat . Yeah , well , I wasn 't too happy when he blew a hole in my base and kicked me out . We all live with disappointment , and right now , we have bigger problems . Does that mean you found it ? I figured you 'd visit me again . I spoke to Gordon . I think we should discuss your visions . Specifically , I 'd like to discuss how you used them to convince Skye to run off and rescue Lincoln . I didn 't convince Skye . I just told her what was gonna happen . It was dangerous and it was foolish , and it won 't happen again . From now on , any decisions based on your gift - will be made by me . - It 's funny . I was just thinking , who decided you should have final say in all the decions around here ? - Raina ... - I 'm just saying , maybe the time has come for someone else to ... I 'm guessing HYDRA doesn 't know Loki 's scepter was the weapon that killed me , but I bet they know it can control minds . In their hands , that 's catastrophic . Coulson , please tell me you know where it is . Segovia . I 'm pretty sure List is headed there right now . Raina . Raina , talk to me . I see ... a scepter . Beautiful ... dangerous ... It isn 't finished yet . So much destruction . I 've just sent you everything I found on Strucker 's location . Coulson , why didn 't you just tell Gonzales why you really wanted to get onto the HYDRA base ? Believe it or not , he puts every decision to a vote . I know . And I was pretty sure if I 'd been honest , I 'd have lost the swing vote , so I did what I had to do . Last thing . Theta Protocol ... is it ready ? Yes , it is . Time to bring in the Avengers . It 's terrible . - Jiaying , it was ... - What ? What was it ? Consequences are upon us . Men made of metal will tear our cities apart . And the world will be changed forever .

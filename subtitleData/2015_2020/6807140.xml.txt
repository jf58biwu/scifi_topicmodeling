So you understand that you will look exactly like this man ? Yes . Of course he understands . Then could you please repeat back to me what you think will happen ? Yes . Look ... he wants the life that I can give him . And he doesn 't want to go back to the Red Zones . He understands that much . Hey , babe . She summoned me today . She did ? What did she want ? She wants to take you out for lunch . So now you 're her errand boy ? Well , I 'm your husband and her son-in-law . Sorry . Look , Laura , just meet her .

They set your priorities straight . You 'll see . It starts tonight . Just watch your back . Gentlemen ! Are you ready for some good , old-fashioned debauchery ? - Yeah ! - Southgate , baby ! Whoo ! What is he ... did you invite him ? - Sure . - You 're working him , right ? - Just burying the hatchet . - Right . Hey , you like my tits ? Huh ? Hey ! Where are you going ? Hey , come back ! Asshole ! - Hey , Rog . - Keep an eye on my boy 's car . You got it . Go ahead , I 'll catch up inside . - Sure thing , you degenerate . - Hey , you 're partaking , too . Hey ! Hey !

Let 's go , all right . - Hey , Ben . - Yeah . - I 'm not an asshole . - I know . You know , it 's just the pressure . They got your balls in a vise and they just never let go . I know . Oh , come on ! - All right . - I don 't feel so good . Oh . Just a minute ! - In a minute . - Come on . - In a minute ! - Come on . I think I 'm done . One more . Hang on ! Oh . - Ow ! What was that ? - What was what ? Come on . Oh , let me guess ... pitcher , catcher ? - Funny . - Oh , ho , where you going ? There are so many more puns where that came from . I haven 't even started . What are you guys doing ? Wow . Who are you ? I 'm Ben . Come on . Shoot . You think you can make it back ? Uh , I ... Yeah , yeah . - Why ? - I-I forgot something . - I 'll be right back . - Okay . Protect our resources , burn your future . Join the Inazagi Corporate Army . Protect our resources . Burn your future . - Heads up . - Join the Inazagi Corporate Army . Hey , suit . - You 're new . - You 're old . See this ? Not my blood . 18 . Yeah ? It 's me . - Hey , Aaron . - Theo . - What are you doing here ? - Getting the usual warm and fuzzy welcome , I gue ... What 's that ? - What happened ? - Nothing . - What do you mean nothing ? - It ... it 's from training . I 've started training . You mean for the cage ? That 's insane . - That 's not what Terrence says . - Terrence ? Yeah , Terrence . He 's the guy around here . He says we 're gonna make a shitload of money together . No , he 'll make a shitload of money . You 'll end up shitting yourself on some street corner . What do you want me to do , huh ? Join one of the corporate armies ? Get blown to pieces in a gas field in Siberia ? I bet you miss these . I bring you cigarettes , Theo ... real ones . There 's good money there . Yeah , and what do you think got me into trouble with Terrence in the first place , Aaron ? It 's Ben . Yeah , sure , I 'll call you Ben , as long as you don 't forget Aaron . I don 't . Is that ... is that her ? 73 % chance . I 've never even come close to 40 % before . - So you found her ? - I might have . - Where is she ? - If it is Elena ... My sister . Where is she ? That 's a group of girls being escorted to Arcadia . - New girls . - That 's a ... - It 's an executive club . - Yeah , sure . Keep telling yourself that . - She 's a sex slave . - Theo . - Can you get in here ? - Not at my level . - And not till I get a promotion . - You fu ... ing suits . And not till I get to the 40th floor . Access is restricted to senior execs . It 's been six years . I know . Tell me you got a plan . What 's that ? Opportunity . Position 's about to open up on the 40th . Well , you got her in there , so you better get her out , for your sake and the sake of that dumb piece of ass you got ... Careful . You see , Ben ... you 're already forgetting . Here it is , The Whistle . I thought you were on the Everclear team . I am , but after Jakarta , bosses are scrambling . They 're fast-tracking any anti-riot tech in development . Natives are getting restless , huh ? - Oh , looks like it . - Sign here . They 're keeping it exclusively nonlethal , though . Yeah , for now . The Whistle . Oh , uh , see if you can stabilize the inhibitors , 'cause the pitch always ends up frying the circuits . I 'll see what I can do . What now ? Mr. Larson 's here to see you . Send him in . Ben . Crazy night , huh ? I woke up with this splitting headache ... How can I help you ? I 've been thinking about Everclear , how to speed things up . You know , the learning process is just a matter of manpower and putting in more hours . Tell me something I don 't know . Well , what I 'm suggesting here is double shifts . I 'm happy to do overtime . Come in on weekends , get more test subjects . Sure , and go over budget and ... We could bring in volunteers from the Red Zones . Shouldn 't be too expensive . The security clearance process would be a nightmare . Look , Ben , I need to ... Are you okay ? I 'm ... I 'm fine . Fine , I just ... Excuse me a second , will you ? Sir , are you all right ? Mr. Peterson ? M-Mr . Peterson ? - How are you feeling ? - Fine , thanks . Can I get you anything ? Some water ? Coffee ? No , you cannot . Uh , are you sure ? No , I 'm fine , thanks . You okay ? Yeah , yeah . Where were we ? Um , Everclear . So ... The flight is nine hours , but it is totally worth it . They have the most beautiful beaches just outside of Reykjavik . So you mean to tell me you don 't miss it ? - Ma 'am , a package for you . - Oh . Thank you . What ... the ungodly hours , the mind-numbing quarterly meetings ? Every frickin ' day . Oh . - Oh . - What 's wrong ? Oh . - Is that ... - Henry 's . Bastard 's been slumming again ... screwing that Red Zone slut he has out there . And he got himself kidnapped . Idiot . Serves him right . They just can 't help themselves , can they ? So what 'll you do ? Pay , I guess . But not just yet . Let him sweat it out a little bit longer . My girl 's here . But you know what ? You should call her . - Henry 's gonna need a new ear . - Maybe I will . Same time next week , Elizabeth . - Hello , Laura . - Hi , Marsha . - Hi , honey . - Mom . So glad you could make it . You look lovely . Thanks . You know , it 's customary in polite society to return the compliment . You look your age . Is that your professional opinion ? It 's the nicest thing I can say . Well , nothing wrong with that , right ? It 's part of the point , really . - Nothing to hide . - You of all people . All right , we always seem to get off on the wrong foot . I just wanted to know how everything is . What 's going on in your life . Ben and I , um ... we got the permit . We 're gonna get pregnant . Well , that 's fantastic . That 's spectacular news . I 'm gonna be a grandmother . It 's too bad there won 't be a grandfather around . Laura , you know I miss your father as much as you do . Right , but we 're not both equally responsible for his absence , are we ? What ? I thought you had nothing to hide . Well , maybe I do have something to hide . Maybe it 's not just a coincidence that a junior executive such as your husband would receive an approved permit so soon . - You didn 't . - Why not ? You may not believe this , but I care about you . God . You just cannot help yourself , can you ? You have to stick your fingers in everything , make it all about you . I was just trying to help . Oh , I don 't need your help . Mom , I am not a child . - I am an ... - An adult ? Last time you were an independent adult , I received a piece of my daughter in the mail . - And ... - You know what ? This is my fault . It is , really . How could I expect it to go any other way ? Laura . Laura , please . - Next . - Next . Next . Next . Step up , sir . - Whoa ! - Everyone back ! Please step out of the scanner , sir . Whoa , whoa , wait , wait , wait . Wait , there must be a mistake . It 's just ... What is it ? What does that mean ? Excuse me ... Oh , that 's not ... That 's not mine ! That 's not mine ! Don 't you understand ? That 's not ... I 've never seen that before ! Sir . Sir . You can go now . I didn 't take that ! No ! - I 've never seen that before ! Please ! No ! It 's not mine ! Ben ? You 're home . Is everything okay ? Chad got fired today . Oh , my God . He must be in the Quiet Room by now . Oh . What 'll happen to his family ? I 'll talk to Elizabeth . She 's not gonna help . You don 't know her like I do . She 's family . No . You and me , right here , this is family . Good morning , ladies and gentlemen . Two days ago , we buried 14 loyal men and women . Yesterday we captured a rat . Hell of a week . It 's heartbreaking to watch someone bite the hand that feeds them . - Spiga is a generous mother . - Thank you . It will feed you , dress you , protect you . In exchange , it only asks for hard work and loyalty . The alternative ... well , we all know Mr. Peterson 's fate . I 'm afraid the stories you heard were true . The good news , for all you ambitious young men and women , is that now we have an opening on the 40th floor . This opening is an opportunity ... not just to serve this family , but to enjoy all the perks and privileges that come with a senior executive position . Ready ? Give me a second . We 'll soon start evaluating candidates . We live in troubled , uncertain times . So the vetting process will be extremely thorough and rigorous . Those who have nothing to hide ... have nothing to fear . Those who do should know ... we will not let another traitor slip through ... not again .

But then last night , some friends of mine in Texas HP called .. Told me they found 3 dead cholos in the pool out on 54 . Not unusual , I know . Except one was missing a hand another one a leg . So they was thinking ... It was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Kruger . But neither one of them can drive ... One being fictional and the other one extinct . And since the wheel lugs they found belong to a 24 Chrysler ... Well ... This is a 24 Chrysler . She found you yet ? Gabriella ? You see ... I 'm not looking for you , Wolvie . Well , not really , I 'm looking for someone , who 's looking for you . She took me something of mine when I wasn 't looking . Something for which I am responsible . A Mexican lady .

Your turn . I 've had a rough night . Well . Poor you . In other news , he told me last night he was communicating with someone . He 's not talking to anybody . Don 't be so sure . He has got all these details . I thought that tank was built to act as a barrier . - It 's gotten cracks in it . - Please stop . Bottom left . You 're not listening . He 's been asking questions again . That why we 're here ... I think he 's trying to read my mind . That 's what these are for . Friends , I have good news for you today ! It 's not about what you do . It 's not about your deed . You gotta give up to God . He knows that you can 't . It 's okay , we are imperfect . Make way , sir . I said make way ! The new " quesalupa " from Taco Bell ! Get it with chicken , get it with steak . Get it with the cheescake right in the shell . It 's the next big thing . Call now , our supplies left ... ! Who are you ? You know who I am . You 're the man who puts me to sleep . We both can use some sleep . No go ! No go ! What are you doing to me ? Charles . Come on . How long have I been here ? What are these ? You remember what they are . Shocks and all the seizures . The pills keep them from happening . How ' bout you blow on them to make you safe . Fuck off , Logan . So , you remember who I am now . I always know who you are . Just sometimes I don 't recognize you . Take the pills . You leave me alone with that fucking albino . He doesn 't listen to me . I know a damn speciation when I see one . What ? Speciation , a new mutant , a young one . - There are forces trying to kill them . - Forces ? They want help . Forces , forces ... Too bad you are not in that business anymore . They don 't want me , they want you . Oh yeah ... That 's how fucking stupid they are . They 're waiting for you at the Statue Of Liberty . Statue of Liberty was a long time ago , Charles . A long time . There are no new mutants . You understand ? There hasn 't been a new one born in 25 years . Not anywhere . We always thought ... We were part of God 's plan . Maybe ... May be we were God 's mistake . What a disappointment you are . When I found you ... You were persuing your career as a cage fighter . A wrong life of an assassin hooked on barbiturates . You were an animal . But we took you in . I gave you a family . They are gone now . Logan . What did you do ? What did you do ? Answer me ! Why are we here ? No one should live like this . Drugged in a fucking tank ! - It 's for your own good . - No no , it 's not ! You 're waiting for me to die . I don 't want to fight ... but there 's things we need to discuss . What things ? Would it be considered nagging ? If I was to repeat my previous observation .. That the dose is too low to suppress the seizures . It 's what the guy gave me . Wasn 't in a position to make demands . Well , I was dying this morning . - That seizure ... - It was barely a minute . It felt a lot longer than a minute . I could not breathe . You are less affected . You know he needs a higher dose . And I know you got more money squirreled away . Money to get us out of here . No , not us . You and him . You 're saving to buy a sun seeker . Sun is the key word . I hardly see myself cowering below deck . It 's like Nosferatu .. Do you ? Folding your underpants , And making him spotted dick . Found this in your pocket . Adamantium . If you 're planning to blow your brains out ... Could you wait till we 're out on the high seas ? - I just mopped these floors . - I don 't need this shit . A year ago , you asked me to help you . And .. God knows I 've tried . But I can 't help you , Logan , not really ... if you are not gonna talk to me . I hear you at night . You are not sleeping . You don 't wanna talk about that . Or the booze you 're drinking . Or the pus you are wiping away from your knuckles . Or the blood I wash in your clothes .. Or the .. fresh wounds in your chest . The ones that aren 't healing . And I 'm pretty sure .. You don 't want to talk about the fact that you can 't read the label on that bottle . It says Ibuprofen . That was my favorite mug . Stay out of my shit . Something is happening to you , Logan . On the inside you 're sick . I can smell it . Best night ever ! Hey , driver . I love you . I love you . You are such a doll . Mr. Logan . Jesus . Please .

Who are you ? You know who she is , Logan . No , I don 't . Does she remind you of anybody ? I 've read about you when I was a kid . I believe you 're thinking of someone else , Now If I 'm not mistaken , you used to work for my team . You were helping round up all those old mutants . What changed ? You got religion ? I 'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys ... and track one more special mutant for me . I 'm not helping you . Of course you would say that . But I 've got a theory that people don 't really change . Beware of the light . Caliban , I bet that 's what your mama told you everyday when you was a kid . Beware of the light . Now , let 's not bring out the worst in it , shall we ? The girl is not worth it , trust me . She is not a natural fuck up , like you . She 's a business mistake , RD going bad . There 's liability . They can 't have things with patents running around hurting people , can they ? We need to get her off the board before she hurts anybody else . Someone you care about , maybe . So get to sniffing . My name is Gabriella Lopez . I 'm a nurse . And for 10 years I worked for Transigen research in Mexico City . Transigen is owned by an American company . What I 'm about to show you is illegal ... in the US and Canada . They told us we were part of a pharmaceutical study . But of course , that was a lie . These children were born in Transigen . They were born here ... and have never left . They have never seen the sun or the ocean ... rain or snow ... or any of God 's creatures . They have no birth certificates ... No names ... besides the ones we have given them . They were raised in the bellies of Mexican Girls . Girls no one can find anymore . Their fathers were semillas anatticus ... Special seeds in bottles . - Birthday , really ? - Hurry up . We just not dressed them up on Halloween . We do not call them baby , or kiss bobos .. Don 't think them as children . Think them as students with patents and copyrights . - Comprende ? - Si seneor . They thought we were too poor and stupid to understand . We are poor , yes ... but we are not stupid . Use your powers . This is business . They are making soldiers . Killers . These are babies of mutantes ... North Dakota . You took that woman 's money . You said you would take the child there . What is she ? She is your daughter , Logan . Alkali has your genetic code . Not just mine . Logan ... I do not want to talk about I don 't wanna hear about it anymore . - Logan ... - Just stop . I have to pee . Last ride . You 're welcome . Stop it for God 's sake , I 'll do this myself . Yeah . Well , you 're not doing it . Not with you standing there . Trust me , I 'm not looking . Hello ! Hi there ! You know you got to pay for that , right ? Hey ! Where 's your Mommy and Daddy huh ? Come on . That 's enough .. These too . Shit ! Not okay ! Sorry . Cell phone chargers ? Come on . Get in the car . As the children became older ... Laura . Laura . They became more difficult . They could not to be controlled . The company made their bodies into weapons . Tried to teach them to kill . But they do not want to fight . A soldier who 'll not fight is useless . Inside this building ... They are working on something new . Something they think is better than the children . Something They say is without a soul . They must have been successful . About a week ago , they told us to shut our programme down . They started putting the children to sleep . We were going to save as many children as we can . I read about a place up North . A place for mutants . They call it Eden . If you 're watching this ... It means that I 'm dead . I am not sure if any other children survived . We were separated . There is no more money . That was a lie . She 's not my child . But I love her . You may not love her . But she 's your child . Please . I beg you ... take her to safety . So it 's where we 're hiding out ? Hiding out . Now we 'll get a couple of hours sleep ... Clean up , get some new clothes , get a new ride , get out of here . Harrah 's Hotel and Casino welcomes you to Oklahoma City . Hey . Endless fun at Harrah 's Hotel Casino . Hey , leave it out front , alright ? Come on let 's go . Hey , Laura . Let 's go . We need clothes . Going up . No , no , stop . These are not toy . - A 'right ! No , no , sorry . The chair . - What ? Okay . Got you . Thank you . Come here . Stay there . Stand there . Logan , it 's yours . What ? Nothing to worry now . We just need the room . We can change in the room . Lying yankee .. Prove it . This is a very famous picture , Laura . It 's almost a 100 years old . In life , in death , Oh Lord . Oh Lord ... abide with me . I first saw this picture in the Essoldo cinema in my own town ... when I was your age . You are in Heaven , hallowed be thy name . Thy Kingdom come , thy will be done ... Shit . Do you read this in your spare time ? Oh yeah , Charles , We got ourselves an X man fan . You do know they are all bullshit right ? Maybe a quarter bit happens , and not like this . In the real world , people die . And no self promoting asshole in a fucking can stop .. This is ice cream for Bed wets . Logan ... Her nurse has been feeding her some great bullshit . I don 't think that Laura needs reminding of life 's imponents . Didn 't you say something about finding us a new ride ? Two more pills in one hour . - Give them to him . - I gotta be going on . Why , Shane ? A man has to be what he is , Joey . Can 't break the moulds . I tried , that didn 't work for me . Joey , there is no living with a killing ... There 's no going back from that . Right or wrong it is a brand . A brand sticks . Now you run on home to your mother and tell her everything is alright . There aren 't anymore guns in the valley . Who are you guys ? More cops ? Cause I told the other guys ... Get up ! In your cage , tracker . You did your job . Fellas . Shit . Knock yourselves out . I say you what . Eight grand ... I 'll have her freshly painted for you , new tires , mounted , balanced and complete paperwork . I 'll give you ten as it is if you can forget the paperwork . Well , you still need new tires . Man , they 're bald . How long will that take ? An hour . Jesus . Oh you gotta be fuckin ' kidding me . Sir , you have your keys in it ... ? Sir ! You have the keys in it ? Sir ! Shit ! Charles . Charles ! Shit ! You alright ? We gotta get out of here . I am so sorry . I am so sorry . Emergency personnel is still on scene . At Harrah 's Casino and Hotel in Oklahoma City where at least 400 guest was striken with temporary paralysis yesterday . Many are noting a similarity to the westchester incident over a year ago . That left over 600 injured ... And took the lives of seven mutants including sevaral of the X. Knock it off . I said knock it off ! She 's a child , Logan . And point of fact , She is your ... How long has it been since you took your meds ? - Tell me , how long has it been ? - You know ! Two days . You saw what happened yesterday . If that shit , had gone on any longer ... I did what I had to do to save Laura . You didn 't do anything . You 'd just freaked out and had a fucking siezure . I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated rambling on like a lunatic . So much easier for you . Easier ? Jesus ! There is nothing easy back here Charles , Nothing ! Please be like the rest of the world . Blaming someone else for your boring shit . I know . I 'm such a giant disappointed . You honestly derived no sense of purpose . From what we are doing ? Okay , what are we doing ? There is a young mutant sitting in our car . Yeah . And where we are taking her , there are others . Does that mean nothing to you ? Oh yeah , yeah it means nothing to me . Especially since nurse Gabriella ... made all that eaten shit up off the fucking comic Books . What are you talking about ? Give those , Take out two pills and give them to him . - Logan , Logan . - Give ' em to him . Now ! I wanna see it . Motherfucking auto trucks . Language Logan . And you 're screaming at a machine . Now what ? She can gut a man with a fitch She can 't hear a few naughty words . She can learn to be better . You mean , better than me ? Actually yes . And by the way , Laura 's foot claws are the obvious result of her gender , you know ? Is that a fact ? In a pride of lions , the female .. Is both hunter and care giver . Good to Know . She uses her front claws for hunting ... And the back claws defensively . Oh yeah ? Thus ensuring their survival . Hey hey ! We should help them . No we have to keep going , someone will come along . Someone has come along . Alert , alert .. Whoa , whoa , whoa ... ! Good boys .. Hey , you need a hand ? Ready ? Go ! Good , got it ! Come on , Let 's get home . Laura ! Thanks so much for your help . - I 'm Kathryn . - James . He 's my son Nate . - Hi . - Hi . That 's your daughter ? Oh yeah , that 's Laura , and that 's my dad ... Chuck . Come on , Laura , let 's go . Well , can we show our appreciation and treat 3 of you to a decent meal ? We don 't live not far from here . - No thanks . - That would be lovely . My name is Dr. Rice . But you can call me Xander if you like . My colleague tells me you have been some of resistant . He believes you 've been dispensing delayed information . To allow your friends to stay one step ahead . I 'm offering you with possibility of redemption , Caliban . To protect the world and in the process , save your friends . The girl is a small price to pay for that . Unlike you , she isn 't pure . She was not made by nature . She 's a mistake of my own . I did what I could and they burned me and beat me . Your colleagues are savages . I agree . The Reavers were very ineffective . But I 'm bringing new tools to bear . But I still need someone to part us in the right direction . No , I can 't help you .

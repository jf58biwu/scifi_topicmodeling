 Previously on Cleverman . Dad told you to keep your head down . What do you think would happen ? . Oh , that 's lovely . - What do you think ? - Real . Every folicule . Hi stranger . Uncle Jimmy was the closest thing I had to a father He chose the wrong Cleverman , didn 't he ? - We can 't take them . - Yes we can . I want those three escapees back in custody by the 6 o 'clock news . As long as those kids are here our people are targets . Oscar ? Come on , Jakey ! Come on , Jakey ! Get up , boy ! Come on ! That 's it , buddy . - Come on . - Kick him in the balls , Jakey ! Let 's go , skins ! Come on , skins ! Come on ! Oi , oi , stay on him . Where you going , bruz ?

Who 's open ? Get in there ! Hands up ! Come on , Gub ! Hey , I 'm heading off . Can you walk me to the checkpoint ? Come on , Gub . Block him , block him ! Boo ! The killings at the old people 's home has got the protesters all riled up again . I talked to Slade about getting a film crew in here . Another eight people are dead . Slaughtered . And you 're talking about film crews . They use propaganda against us . We need to fight back in a way they can understand . Get them to see that the Hairies are just like them . If we can 't do that , we 're screwed . The last attempt at getting footage didn 't exactly turn out right . Calling in the professionals . Slade ? Seems genuine . It 's not gonna stop the killings , though , is it ? They 're calling it a massacre . That 's the language of war . It doesn 't matter how many feel-good stories you tell about what nice folk the Hairies are . Have you spoken to Koen yet ? What do you want me to do , beg ? He 's the ordained one . Koen has no idea . You need to talk to him . - He won 't listen to me . - So make him . Shouldn 't be up to me . I can only control what I can . Oi . Are Hairies welcome ? Hairies out ! Hairies out ! - Are Hairies human ? - Not like us ! See you . - Do we want them outside the wall ? - Hairies out ! - Are Hairies welcome ? - Hairies out ! - Are Hairies welcome ? - Hairies out ! ID , please . Jarrod ... just checking the progress of that film crew coming to the Zone . Can you call me ? Stop harboring the Hairies , you black bastard ! - Do we want them in our schools ? - Hairies out ! How long are you in the country for ? - Three months . - Where you headed next ? Vietnam , Thailand , maybe Cambodia if my budget stretches . Hey , Cambodia . Angkor is a must . The ancient Khmer were truly one of the great civilizations . Ruins in need of a makeover . You have no soul for travel . All right . It 'll take a few minutes for the drug to take effect . After that , I 'll be putting you through a series of tests . - Till then , just relax . - Awesome . Okay . Using the placebo or the Hairy juice ? Real thing . Jamie , just pedal as hard as you can for as long as you can . We 'll be measuring your body 's response . Is he gonna turn Hairy ? We 're focusing on target heart rate levels for now . Still steady at 65 . That pace is remarkable . He 's just smashed the world 1k sprint record . Whoa . Whoa , whoa . - What 's happening ? - He 's heating up . I thought we had sorted this . I lowered the mitochondria levels . Heart rate 's 200 . 250 . 350 . See that his family are looked after . As terror mounts in the community following the nursing home massacre , there is renewed pressure on the government 's containment policies . This massacre is the first time that multiple people are suspected to have been murdered by a Hairyman in one incident , causing grave concern that more multiple attacks will follow . Belinda Frosche , Network 8 . - Slut . - What ? Go away . I think this is a conversation you should be having with Mom . Not expecting you to understand . But I want you to know it 's over . Like I said , you 're talking to the wrong person . I thought our family was different . I thought you were different , better . At least that 's what everyone else seems to think . I mean , Jesus , Dad . Why ? And her of all people ? Blaming the Hairies for all those killings like she just loves it ? I reckon you 'd have more to say if some guy did this to me . If you don 't tell Mom , I will . Good song , huh ? I made it . You gonna do something ? I 'm not her keeper . Mate ... would you like a drink ? - Where is he ? - Out the back . You look like a whiskey man . I 'll get you one . On the house . - How do you take it ? - Neat . Yes . See , I like a man who appreciates his single malt . The punters here , they mix cola , all sorts of rubbish . It 's a travesty . What the hell are you doing ? About to ask you the same thing . More people dead , and what are you doing about it ? - What ? - That soccer kid . Old people last night . Or don 't you watch the news ? All dead , all with their hearts ripped out . What are you on about ? Hairies did all that . They 're not what 's doing the killing . Never got it , did you ? It 's just stories , Waruu , like the Easter Bunny , like Santa Claus . I 'm sorry to break it to you . More people are gonna die unless you act . Waruu , go home and be the big man . Jimmy give you the nulla nulla ? You better pray you remember how to use it . Oi , brah , she 's with me . - What ? - She 's with me . The hell she is . I said she 's with me . Come on . Oi . Hey . Blair , get him out of here . Get out of here . Out ! It 's not exactly magic , is it ? You 're a disgrace . Stupid . What do you guys call it ? Us guys ? Don 't give me shit , Koen . Your people . The Namorrodor . And it rips the heart out of its prey ? That 's how the story goes . Your brother seems to think it 's more than a story . Well , Waruu doesn 't know shit . Right about the Cleverman thing , though , huh ? You 're the only person that can kill it . - Ash . - How would you do it ? - Come on . - Hypothetically speaking . If it was real . You wouldn 't just dong it on the head with this . Hey , you 're not allowed . 'Cause I 'm a woman . You remember that much , then . Okay , you can 't just bash it on the head . There 's ... there 's stuff . There 's cultural stuff . Cultural stuff . Yeah . Oh , boy . We 're all fine , then . Hmm . 'Night . - Angel . - Hey . I thought you wanted to draw a line in the sand . Ilythia offer a totally different process to what we 've been through . Yeah , you have to be a supermodel to get pregnant . The marketing 's appalling , but the science , it 's ... it 's very ... Go on , tell me about the science . Well , essentially they spike the ovum with a supercharged mitochondria so that it has a better chance of taking . Spike ? Uh , yeah , that 's the Latin term . What do they take the mitochondria from ? Uh , a plant , I think . Well , it 's all under patent , so they were a little vague about the details . I wasn 't gonna go , but ... They 've got a 95 % success rate , Jarrod . What ? Just , I thought we decided ... it 's too heartbreaking . I know . I know , but ... Look , um ... I 've got an appointment for Wednesday . Um , will you come ? Jarrod ? Jarrod . Of course I 'll be there . How long till we eat ? I need to make a call . Hmm ? Uh , just give me five , yeah ? The heat exchange was greatest in the adipose tissue in his back , yes ? - Correct . - Now listen . All we need to do is separate the mitochondria from the uncoupling protein . We 'd need some form of uncoupling inhibitor . I 'd start with Sestrin-2 . Do it . Proof it . Let 's move forward . Open your mouth . How could you do this ? Mouth . Latani , come on . I 'll find them . Hey , girl , what do you think you 're doing ? Djukara , you got to shave . They 're looking for you . Boy ! Get out of here . Put some more weights on that rack . - Teach me . - No . Why ? Is it because I 'm a Hairy ? Hey , you deaf ? Leave it . Come on , Gub . Slow your feet down . You gotta mean the hit . Lead . Lead with the shoulder . Use your hips , okay ? Jab , jab , and then counter . That 's it . That 's it . That 's it . Jab , jab , and counter . Again . Jab , jab , counter . Keep it tight . Keep it tight . Jab , jab . That 's it , that 's it . Whoa . Hey there , little brother . How you doing ? - I 'm all right . - Look strong . What can I do you for ? I 'm looking for a weapon . Well , take your pick . Whatever you need . I need to find my father . Oh . So you want something a bit more serious . Eh ? Something like that ? What are you gonna do ? Bust in there single-handed ? It seriously won 't get you anywhere . It 'll be all right . I know where he is . I was there . Knowing where he is and getting there aren 't the same thing . - Hey . - I 'll be all right . What , so you 're just gonna walk through the checkpoint with your nonexistent ID ? Even if you did , you 'd be picked up on the streets by the CA in a second looking like that . I 'll wear a hoodie . And gloves . And a balaclava . - I 'm not shaving . - Then you 're an idiot . - Hairies out ! - No , no , no , no , no . You can 't come in , mate . You gotta ... you gotta back it up . You can 't come in , all right ? Hairies out ! Hairies out ! Hairies out ! Oi . CA not letting the food trucks through . We haven 't had delivery for two days now . He 's trying to starve us out . Matthews . What are we gonna do ? Leave it with me . Here . Are you okay ? No . No . Ah , that 's Koen 's . He 'll go nuts if he sees you . Hey , Ash , can you help me ? It 's private stuff . Kora . Kora ? Well , we have to call her something . That 's Koen 's mum . He never talks about her . She died in a car accident . Hit and run . They never found out who did it . She died before he was even born . Emergency C-section . Holy shit . Hey , no , no , no ! Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Oh , yeah , false alarm . What are you doing , Ash ? It wasn 't Ash , bro . It was our home alone friend here . Oi , can ... that 's good , yep . I want to see Minister Matthews . Do you have an appointment ? No , I don 't . The minister is away from the office at present . I 'll wait till he gets back . - Name ? - Waruu West . And what 's this about , Mr. West ? Oh , he knows what it 's about . Matthews . Mr. Waruu West . - What does he want ? - To see you . What should I tell him ? You have an 11 : 00 . The 11 : 00 can wait . Just make sure he 's comfortable . I 'll see him once I 've finished up here . The minister will see you as soon as he 's able . Can I get you a tea ? Coffee ? No , thanks . Call Waruu West . - Waruu West . - Jarrod Slade . I 've got a reporter coming to the Zone today as we discussed . I believe you might know her . Belinda Frosche . Great . Thanks , but I 'm not sure she 's right for the job . She 's perfect ... audiences trust her and she 's been on this story from the start . But sending a woman ... Look , I have nothing against Ms. Frosche . It 's a volatile place . The Zone is ... How very old-fashioned of you , Mr. West . Believe me , Belinda knows how to handle herself . I 'm sure she does , but it 's not her world . It 's not my wife 's either , but I 'm not worried about her working there . Oh , well , the ... the clinic is different . It 's your good work that keeps things safe , keeps my wife safe . I 'll get Belinda to give you a call . Oh . I know you . I 've seen your face somewhere before . Oh . Atta girl . Get on the bed . How long ? Two hours . - Structural damage ? - None . Unless you count the box . Incubation time . Mouse 30 minutes . 90 for the chimp . It worked on the chimp ? The chimp didn 't cook ? The mouse is gonna break its neck in there . And humans ? Are you volunteering , sir ? Hey , stranger . So I 'm heading your way . - Where are you ? - Yeah , I 'm heading off now . Meet me inside the checkpoint in 20 minutes . You gonna take me to meet your wife ? Don 't play games . Ugh , come on , Waruu . We 're freaking adults . Well , you know we were . Look , this doesn 't need to be a miserable experience . Checkpoint , 20 minutes . Tell the minister I had to cancel . After you , sir . I 'm inside the gate . Where are you ? Are you sure this is the right place ? They 're gone . They 're all gone . They 're dead . They 're all dead . You don 't know that . I 'm never gonna see my father again ! We should tell my dad . He 'll know what to do . Should have just left me here . At least I 'd have been with my father . Hairies out ! Hairies out ! Yeah , whatever . Hey . I 'm , uh ... I 'm looking for someone to take me to meet the Hairy people . Hey , man , she 's on the news . You wanna be my tour guide ? Got 10 bucks ? She wants to see the Hairies , but we thought we should check with Waruu first . Hi . I 'm Belinda Frosche . - I know exactly who you are . - Network 8 . I 've seen the reports . My husband Waruu 's not here , but how can I help ? Uh , I 'm interested in getting the other side of the story . You know , seeing things from the perspective of the Hairy peoples , and I was ... just hoping that someone could take me to where they live and introduce me . I can take you down to the Hairy precinct . Sure they 'll be happy to speak to you . I 'll just get my bag . Well , you 've been busy . Break and enter . Conspiracy to commit murder . Conspiracy to perform a terrorist attack . Member of a terrorist organization . The Brotherhood is a peaceful movement . This peaceful symbol was drawn in a man 's blood . Listen , we know you 're holding these subhuman fugitives in the Zone . Hand them back to us and we 'll forget you had anything to do with it . I 'm not giving you these boys . Do you wanna see your family again ? Those boys didn 't kill that guard , but I know who did . You 've got photos of me in the containment center . Have another look . I 'm wearing a camera on my chest , and I have footage of that guard being murdered . The government 's got plenty of mileage out of blaming the Hairy boys and stirring up hate , but I saw who did it , and it wasn 't a Hairy . And the Hairy boys didn 't paint this symbol either . There wasn 't a mark on the wall after that guard was killed . You blokes or someone you work for did that . So go ahead and charge these boys . See how far you get . Yeah . We 're further along than we thought we were . We need to accelerate things . What do you want me to do ? Pick up the item ... now . We need it for the next stage . That 's it , off the backboard . Shoot a jump shot . That 's it . Wait . - He 's here . - Yeah ? It 's the big guy , Maliyan . We need to talk to him first . Do you think this would be all right ? - I 'd say so . - Okay . It 's best you go on your own from here . They might not talk if I 'm there . All right . All right . Hey , it 's this girl . What ? Uh , hi . My name 's Belinda Frosche . - I 'm from Network 8 . - I know you . That 's ... okay . I 'm just a reporter . I just wanna ask some questions and get the other side of the story . Oh , really , bitch ? I can ... I can help get your message out there , you know ? And we don 't have to ... we don 't have to film if that 's not what you want . I can help change people 's minds . Please , just ... just think about what you 're doing . Shh . - Maliyan . - What ? ! Come on , you don 't have to do this . You skin-mob always telling us what to do ! Just let her go , please . Go on , kill her . If you don 't , she 'll go back and tell them lies about us . Hmm ? But if you do kill her , get ready . She 's white . She 's famous . And they 'll come back after all of us . And you know it . Screw this ! Uh , thank you . I 'm saving us , not you . You 're not worth dying for . You 're scum . They shot my little sister . And your people filmed it . You didn 't even try and say anything . You didn 't try and stop them ! You just let them film it ! And then you played it on the television over and over and over again ! - Let me help you . - I 'm okay . You 're so full of it . You build this ... wall around you . That right ? You 're not alone in this , Koen . You have Blair . You have me . We 're with you . You just need to tell us how we can help you kill that thing . You hear yourself ? You know how crazy that sounds ? Not as crazy as someone who 's been given some special gift , using it to pour beer . Hey . I don 't think the universe stuffed up , by the way . You 've always had something . She was here . You do what you want to me . I can take it . But getting Alinta involved , that 's not on . You hear me ? Nerida ... God , Waruu , just ' cause you want something doesn 't mean you have to take it . You were so close to losing everything ... me , Alinta , the respect of the people around here . You wanna sort your shit out . We 've worked too hard and too long for you to mess it up now . No ! No ! Remember how we talked about what 's cool and not cool ? This is definitely not cool ! Kora , put the gun down ! Where the hell did she get a gun ? Thought we needed protection . Yeah , we do , brah , from her . Aah ! - Nobody move , here ! - No ! Kora ! Kora ! Give me the gun . Give me the gun . - Here , here , here . - Ash . Here , here , here . Here . You 've got something of mine and I 've got something of yours . Give me back the girl and you can have your friend . Sounds simple . It 's the way I like to keep things . No one need get hurt . And what happens to her ? The girl ? That 's not your problem . Kora ? Come down here . Kora ! It 's all right , Kora . Go on . Go to the man . Go on . Now Ash . Issue there . Boss wants you , too . - Hey . - Ash ? ! - Ash ... - Call an ambulance ! - Call an ambulance ! - Help us . Ash , Ash , Ash , Okay , I ... Ash . Ash . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Ash . Ash ? Hey . Ash ! Ash ! Ash . Ash . Ash . Ash ? I love you . Stay with me . Baby ? - Ash . - We need to go , bro . No . I 'm not leaving her . - Blair , we need to get out ... - Ash . Blair , she 's gone , okay ? She 's gone . Get out of here . Come on ! Leave me alone ! Ashley ! - Glowing ... - Now , we gotta go .

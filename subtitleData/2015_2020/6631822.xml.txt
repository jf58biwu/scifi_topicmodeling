 Exposure time ? 24 hours since subject 's contact with the spores . Symptoms ? Nosebleed at four hours , internal hemorrhaging at eight , psychotic break at twelve .

Now let 's see you slide down to the floor . Good . - Doctor Locke , headquarters on V-Link-One . Standby . - We 're aware of the Level One breach . - A minor setback . - This is a potential disaster . - With all due respect , the biological process is as much art as it is science . - The board doesn 't see it that way . Majority votes to kill the project . - The antiserum is a success . - It means nothing without the vaccine . We 're pulling the plug . - One week . Give me one week . I 'll deliver . - One week , Doctor Locke . Or it all goes . Renner , to the nerve center . - Right here , sir . - Activate patient zero . Tonight , we go live . - Perfect . Jackson , load up my truck . - Oh god . My soldier boy is finally home .

Wait , what 's going on ? What are you guys talking about ? - What are you talking about ? You know what , I don 't , okay . How about we propose a toast to the man of the hour ? - To the King of Mean . - To the married couple . - Here 's to Dean . - Oh ! Oh ! - To Dean . - Cheers . - And I , at first , I was going to be like turquoise but then I saw these . - Oh , so Rhonda . - Thank you , I love it . Has everyone seen my beautiful nails ? - Yes . - Blinding me . - You think you 're Catwoman or something ? - What do you know about Catwoman ? If I was Catwoman I would take you out like that . - And you 'd be dead . Watch out . All right , put the claws away . - Guys , I hate to be a party-pooper but I think Dean and I are pretty tired so , Tired . We 're going to go to bed . Tired . - Okay , so I 'm just letting you know . All right , yeah , we know , we know . Goodnight . Good night , lovebirds . Thank you all for coming . When duty calls . If you need an extra hand , let me know . Don 't forget early tomorrow morning . Bright and early . - Ah ! That 's pretty impressive . - It is ? - I 'm not gonna lie . - Then thank you . - Yeah , but you 're gonna regret it . Oh , am I ? - Yeah . - Oh ! Oh , wow , muscles . - That 's right . So you 're not going anywhere , got it ? - No . Ow . - Ooh . - Checkmate . - Yeah . - Yeah . - Why don 't you start packing ? Your duffel bag 's by the door next to your mail from last week . Okay . What 's this ? - When was the last time you talked to her ? - Two years ago . Maybe more . She doesn 't have a house phone , you know . She doesn 't have email . She lives out in the middle of nowhere . The only way to contact her is through snail mail . - Dean , it 's okay . - Hey , you guys ready to go ? - No . - Adjusting to civilian life not going so well or ? - My grandmother 's farm needs a major overhaul or else the Mentryville D.A. is going to kick her out on her ass . - Well , why don 't we stop by on the way ? I 'm sure the rest of the group won 't mind . - We gotta get back there . Next time , we 'll ditch the friends . Hey guys , let 's stop for supplies . - How 's the nest ? - Quiet . - Good . Make sure it stays that way . - Got it . - Dean , what the hell is that ? It 's a mine . Got tunnels running underground all over the place . - Cool . - That 's it up ahead . I 'm not getting any service out here . I can 't do anything . It 's called romantics , sweetpea . What are you doing ? Checking to see if - Are you okay ? - I don 't remember it this way . What a dump . It 's worse than I thought . - It 's not that bad . - Seems like a lot of work . - It 's nothing we can 't handle . - Where , where 's the towels ? Maybe she 's not here . - This is my house and I 'll do as I please with it . Gram ? Grandma ? Grandma ? Gram , it 's Dean . - Dean ? Remember ? You 're a man , now . Oh , my . Oh ! Dean . - I brought some friends to help . - Oh , all that nonsense with the health inspectors , pish posh ! I 'll ... I 'll just sweep off the porch again and they 'll move on . If I had known you were coming I 'd have tidied up a bit . I 'm something of a packrat , but , um , please come in . You all must be thirsty . Dean , you remember where the kitchen is ? - Yeah , yeah . I sure do , Grandma . - Whoa , this is worse than the hoarders on T.V. - Izzy ! - I 'm sorry , you know it 's true . - Come on , you guys . With all of us we can get this place clean in no time . - Always a cheerleader , Rhonda . I 'm with Izzy , guys . When can we jet ? - Travis , don 't be a douche , we just got here . Okay , that 's something . You know what , not that I have a preference for living- - - Can you guys please stop complaining and be a friend ? Yeah . - She 's got company . - How many ? Six . - Uh , can we speed up the harvest time ? - Negative , Doctor . - Stay there . You 're on babysitter detail . - All right . What if they try and leave ? - Use your imagination . - All right . - I can barely remember what he was like . It 's not like I 'm unaware . It isn 't normal , I know that . It 's just I can 't help myself . Before your grandfather passed I was a collector . After he died it turned into something else . I ... I can 't let anything go . Here I am dumping my problems on you . To tell the truth , it 's ... it 's embarrassing . - Hey , Grandma ... we 're going to get through this . - You and me , we are . Renner , update ? - Yeah , we 're under control . Bang . Increase the amino acid concentrate . Amino acids coming up . - Pump the enzyme levels . Enzyme levels coming up . Enzyme levels are at max . - Crap . Good work today , guys . What do you say we call it , huh ? - Yeah , big day tomorrow . If that 's what you call it . - Are you sure it 's safe to sleep in here ? - One night isn 't gonna kill anybody . It 's true . I 'll be in the Tahoe . Goodnight . Mmm . No , why , are you ? Oh yeah , boy . You know why ? - Why ? - Because I have to be . Oh , man . Dean ? How long you been out here ? - Not long . Old habits . - New to me . - You sleep okay ? - At some point you 're gonna have to talk to me . - We are talking . - You know what I mean . You 're not the same person . I want to know where the version of Dean before he left went . - Where 's Rhonda ? - Still sleeping . You sleep okay ? - No , you ? - Is everything okay with you ? - We leave no later than 4 p.m. - We leave when the job is done . - Ooh , burn . - Let 's just see how much progress we make and then we can figure it out from there . Cool ? Ah , Frank loved that , keep . Oh , keep . Keep . All right . What about this Grandma ? What do you say ? Your grandfather told me a story once about two monks , one old and one young walking along together . Did you know that monks are not supposed to have any contact with women ? - I didn 't know that . - Well , they see a woman standing by a stream and she seems stuck . She seems to want to go across but she 's wearing a long skirt . The old monk picks her up , carries her across the stream , puts her down . And five hours later , the young monk says , " Why did you carry that woman ? " And the old monk says , " Ah , I put her down hours ago . " Why are you still carrying her ? " Oh . I don 't feel so good . - Whoa , I got you . - Oh . Oh , my god . - Oh , keep your head back . - Nosebleed , figures . Air 's dry up here . - You know what , I feel a little dizzy . Can we sit down somewhere ? - Oh yeah , yeah . Come on , here . - Thanks . - Yeah . I can get headway here . All right . What about this one ? Oh , I 'll keep him . Keep . And this ? Yeah , keep . Keep . Oh , keep . Yeah . Okay . - Sorry to interrupt . Dean , I need you to take a look at something . Um , let 's take a break , okay ? - Okay . Be right back . All right . - How long has she been like this ? - 10 minutes . - Rhonda , can you hear me ? Oh , my god . - Hold her down . Hold her down . Oh my god , oh my god . Get her feet , get her feet . Get me something to put in her mouth . Go . - Make her stop . - We need to her to a hospital , Dean . Where 's the closest one ? - 30 miles No ! No ! - So it begins . - What 's wrong ? - No gas . Ah ! - Oh , my god . I got her . Got any ideas on what the hell this is ? - She doesn 't have any allergies . - What about that disease you get from mouse shit ? I 've seen mice here . Maybe it 's ... uh ... Hantavirs or whatever it is . - That doesn 't fit , Ricky . - How do we know that we don 't have what she has ? - We don 't . Wait , good . Yeah , that 's real reassuring , guys . That 's .. - I started tracking Rhonda 's symptoms when she got sick . She was fine last night , didn 't say anything was wrong . At eight this morning , she gets a nosebleed . By one , she couldn 't even get out of bed , that 's five hours . - When did she get the rash ? - 30 minutes later . - Then the bleeding . It sounds like a virus to me . - Is she really- - Ah ! Oh , shit . Ah ! She 's gone mad . - Rhonda , Rhonda ! Relax , Rhonda . Ah ! Oh ! - Rhonda ! - No ! Rhonda . Rhonda . Are you insane ? - You saw her come at me . Rhonda . Rhonda . Travis , what did you do ? I did what I had to . - It was under control . - It didn 't look that way . - Travis , you 're an idiot , man . Oh , Rhonda . She 's dead . Is she dead ? - Get a sheet . - Oh , don 't dude . Come on , man . - Get a sheet . It was self-defense . Right ? Guys ? - Give me your phones . Give me your phones , come on . - I don 't have mine . - Come on , Izz . - Now you listen to me . You run as fast as you can until you get through to 9-1 - 1 , do you hear me ? - Travis , please , just go . - Go . - Where are you going ? - Her sister 's getting married in June . - I know this is hard . - There is no getting around that . Rhonda 's not the first friend that I 've lost . And there will be time for mourning later , but right now we 've got to focus on getting out of here , okay ? That 's what she 'd want . Come on . Come on . Oh . Yes ! Yes . 9-1-1 operator . What is your emergency ? - We need help . - Grandma , I need you to stay put until I come and get you . - Oh ? - Okay ? - Okay . - Can you do that for me ? - Yes . Yes . - Any sign of Travis yet ? - No , not yet . - I 'm going to have to go . Oh , wait , no , no . Here he is , here he is . Come on , what 's the deal ? - Help 's on the way . - Thank , god . Nice job . - Yeah . How 's about a little love ? Izzy , he 's just compensating . Really ? I 'm gonna end up just like Rhonda . - What happened ? Oh no , Izzy . - You 'll be fine , Izz . No , I won 't . Izzy , you got at least five hours before it gets to that point , okay ? Help is on the way , right , Travis ? - What 'd they say , Travis ? - An hour . Tops . - Hey , you hear that , Izz ? It 's going to be okay . - Let 's go for a walk . Yeah ? I 'm scared . - Izz , look at me . I 'm not going to leave you . I 'm not going to let anything happen to you . - Promise ? - Promise . Let 's see , a virus can spread through the exchange of bodily fluids or transfer of blood . What is that ? What ? What the hell ? Where 's the help ? You said they should be here . Somebody should be here . - Izzy ! - Where is everybody ? - It 'll be , everything will be ... - What ? - Nothing . You 're , you 're beautiful . - Travis , now is not the time . - Good , come on . Izzy ! Izzy , Izzy ! Dean ! Mandy ! - Izzy ! What happened ? - I don 't know , she just fell down . - Izzy ? - What ? - I don 't know , she just fell down . Okay , okay . Turn her over , turn her over . - Oh ! - Oh ! - Ah ! Turn around , Mandy . Izzy ! - This isn 't real , this is not happening . This is not happening . - Calm down . Izzy ! - No , No , Dean , Dean ! All my friends are dead . Izzy ! Izzy . Izzy 's dead . - Anybody feeling any symptoms ? Shortness of breath ? Dizziness ? Anything ? Nosebleeds ? Everyone check . Ricky ? - Help should be here by now . - What to you want ? Get the hell out of here . - What 's the rush ? Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! - Dean , are you okay ? - Dean ] Not now , Mandy - Stop , stop , please . Can we just wait for help , please ? That 's precious . We blocked all cellphone communications for 50 miles . Who 's " we " ? You talked to somebody , right , Travis ? - Yeah , of course . - 9-1 - 1 , what is your emergency ? - It was you ? - Of course . - We 're all gonna die out here . - No , we 're not . Travis , take her to the schoolhouse , go . All right , Dean . Who is this guy , huh ? Who the hell are you ? Go search the car , Ricky . - All right . - Search the car . All right . - Who do you work for ? - Screw you , soldier boy . - Who do you work for ? - Your Ma . I got something . What do we have here , huh ? What the hell is this ? Give it here . Huh ? Give it here . Level One Viral . - Now you got it . - It was you . You good with knots , Ricky ? - Yeah , yeah , I 'm an Eagle Scout . Get him , get him inside . - Don 't you- - - Turn around . Turn around . Go stay in the schoolhouse from now on . And go check on Mandy , I got this . All right ] All right , no more wasting time . Start talking . - Pharmaceuticals , drug company . What do they want with my grandmother ? The want her DNA for the vaccine . Vaccine for what ? - For the virus . - What virus ? - I don 't know , I 'm not the brains . Apparently , it can spread through spores . - Where will I find it ? Where will I find it ? - They 'll kill me . - Oh yeah , So will I. - You 're all dead already . - We 'll see about that . Come here . Ah ! Ah ! Hold it , hold it ! - Tell me . - The old mining building . Where ? - The old mining building . Ah ! Renner , come in . Renner ? - Sir ? - Problem at the nest . Come on . All right . Stop , turn around . Always secure a big fellow just a little bit more , huh . What do you think 's going to happen when I don 't get on the Walkie ? Got any tape in there , Ricky ? Oh yeah , we do have some tape . - You 're a dead man . - Why don 't you just quiet up for a little bit . All right , get in the closet . Come on , let 's go Yo , Dean . Check this out , man . It 's a spores detection unit . - Dean , please do not keep me in the dark . What is going on ? You know how to use one of these ? Yeah , I should be all right . - Dean , your grandmother is still inside . Okay , think this through . Come on , think this , Dean ? All right , time 's up . We 're moving forward . - We need another 72 hours to finish the concentrate . - No , you don 't . - Grandma ? I am so sorry . In the desert , we had to put these 70 pound packs on our backs , it was torture on a good day . The thing is , is even though I 'm not wearing the pack I still felt the weight of it . But not anymore . I feel a hell of a lot lighter . - A satori . - What ? - Satori . It 's a moment that enlightened you . - I guess I had a satori then . - Where is he ? - We 've traced the GPS coordinates . He 's still at the nest . - Get the extraction jeep ready . - I don 't feel so good . Lean back , let me see . See ? Nothing , you 're okay . - I was worried . I 'm going to end up like the others . - No . No , no you are not , Mandy . Listen to me , I am not going to let you die out here , okay ? Now there 's a vaccine about three miles away . - Vaccine won 't work . What do you mean , why not ? - I 'm already infected , I need an antiserum . - What 's that . - It creates antibodies in your bloodstream and kills viruses . - Okay , antiserum , got it . - Even then , we don 't know for sure . It all depends on how my immune system reacts to it . You 're going to be eating P.B. and J 's on the beach , all right ? - Third Gen is ready . - Prep for inoculation trial . - I must have been infected when we checked Rhonda 's room . It affects everyone the same way . I 've got less than an hour . - And if the kids get in our way ? I love you , Izzy . My last proclamation of my undying love is now that I ask for your hand in holy matrimony . So , Izzy , will you marry me ? - Travis . Why don 't we take a walk ? - I 'm off the market now , ladies . My heart beats for one true love . - Good news , man . There 's an antiserum , you 're gonna be all right . - Hey , mister . The lady and I are engaged now . - Congrats , I 'm happy for you . - No , you 're not . - Just relax , big guy . - You want her for yourself , don 't you ? - No , she 's all yours . I won 't let you take her from me . - I don 't want to hurt you , Travis . - No one threatens my Isabelle . Hey , hey ! Izzy ! Sssh , come on . Izzy . It 's all right , hey . Izzy . It 's all right , man . No , wait . He 's not in there , he 's in there . Mandy ? Mandy , I need you to be brave , baby . Huh ? Come on . Stand up , come on . Okay , there you go . Mandy . Mandy , listen to me . I need you to look at this . I want you to focus on it , okay ? I want you to see the crashing waves and I want you to hear them wash over the sand . I want you to smell the ocean air . Can you do that for me ? Alpha , Bravo , Charlie , take positions . Exit now , we have you surrounded . Surrender peacefully and no one will be harmed . - It 's a little late for that . We 're already infected in here . We 're not interested in you . We only want our man you 're holding hostage and Sara Pierce . - Yeah , what do you want her for ? She 's sick , Dean . I think you know that . We need to help her . - On one condition , my girl gets the antiserum . I can authorize that . You just need to surrender yourself now . Nobody gets hurt ? You have my word . All right , I hope he 's not lying for your sake . Open the door on three . One , two , three , we 're coming out . - Ceasefire . - Gives a whole new meaning to friendly fire . A big mistake . - Move . Come on , Dean , talk to me . What now ? Okay . All right , okay . All right . Now , on my move I want you to stand up and make as much noise as possible . You let them know we 're in here , okay ? Okay . - All right , on my go . Go . - Where are you going ? Where are you going ? Oh , shit . What are you waiting for , huh ? Come on in , it 's just us . Come on . We 're sick and tired of this . Just come in . Come on . What are you waiting for , huh ? We 're just a bunch of kids , right ? Come on . Come on in . Nice , dude , we did it . Ricky ! Ricky ! Oh , man , oh . Okay , stay still man . - Oh , shit . It 's okay . - Oh , shit . Did I get him ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? - Yeah , you got him . Good . This might be a stupid question , but do you think I could get my hand sanitizer on the bullet wound ? Dean ? Go , go get her . Go get her . - Okay . What is it ? Hey . It was an airborne spore virus . It 's an airborne spore virus . Hey , ssh . - It 's an airborne spore virus . Come on . - It 's an , god , just go . Just go please . - No . - Just go . No , I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm right here . Hmm . Hello , patient one . Dean . I know you can hear me . - Who 's this ? - Doctor Locke . - You 're the one who needs my grandmother 's DNA for the vaccine . - That is correct . - You give me your word you treat us with it first , I 'll bring you what you need . You have it . - No , I want to hear you say it . - You have my word , just bring her to me . All right , all right , baby . Come on , in the car , in the car . Okay . All right , I just got to do one more thing , honey . Goodbye , grandma . We 're on our way , you be ready for us . Bring her to me . Oh ! Are you all right , you all right ? I 'm good , I 'm good , I 'm good . - I need your help . - All right , what are we doing ? - I need you to go to the schoolhouse , okay ? I need you to go down the hatch , which leads to a tunnel , which goes to the mine . Are you listening to me ? - Yeah , I 'm listening . I 'm listening . - Okay . I 'm going to take the Hummer with Mandy . You 're going to meet us there , all right ? It 's three forks . Left . Left . Right . Three forks . Left . Left . Right . Got it ? - Let 's do this , all right . Fuck it . - Lead the way . Stay with me , baby , we 're almost there . - Where is she ? - She 's right here . - Pardon me ? - Sara 's DNA , it 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? - I want her alive . - So did I. - May I ? - No , not yet . - So young , yet so much blood on your hands . What 's your body count up to now ? - Why her ? Why Sara ? - Every year we scour the globe to identify new and rare bacteria , a viral strand . We discovered an abnormally potent species growing in your grandmother 's basement . Sara breathed contaminated air for a decade without suffering a single symptom . No human being can withstand that kind of exposure . - But she did . So you figure she 's immune . - Mmm . You manufacture a virus and then you tap her DNA and reverse-engineer a vaccine . - I 'm not expecting you to understand . - You gambled with my grandmother 's life . You 're overlooking the beauty of it . Discovering something lethal , harnessing it and then eradicating it . As long as there 's disease , there will be a need for people like me , people who can go head to head with nature 's worse . You are killing innocent people here . Well , you got it all wrong , Dean . I 'm not taking lives , I 'm saving them . Mandy ! Mandy , breathe . Are you saving them ? - I was spared once . I know about loss and I 'm aware of the extremes it can cause a man to go to . Welcome . Beautiful , aren 't they ? The spores started as a simple delivery system for the virus vector . But they adapted and became something much more complex . Sample ? - Moment of truth . Commence chemical wash and bio-deconstruction . - Prepping sample . - All right . - Initiating bio-deconstruction . The strand is structurally protected . - It 's viable . Transfer it from manufactory . All right , give it to her . Now . Antiserum entering bloodstream . Hey . Start testing him immediately . Hey . Vaccine is viable . - Good work , we 'll take it from here . - What ? - You fulfilled the terms of your contract . We 'll transfer final payment to your account . You 're free to leave . - You , you can 't take me off the project . This is just the beginning . - I 'm afraid it 's already done , Doctor Locke . This wasn 't your fight . No , why , are you ? Oh , yeah , boy . You know why ? - Why ? Because I have to be . I wasn 't there for you , man . Ain 't nothing you wouldn 't have done . Don 't let them kill us both , okay . Mandy ? Mandy ! Where is she ? Where 's Mandy ? Mandy ! Let me out of here . - I 'm heading out , make sure you record his time of expiration . Yes , sir . Sir , there 's a code blue in vaccination . I didn 't hear an alarm . You didn 't hear it at all ? It 's crazy , there 's an alarm . It 's like they 're evacuating ... You ready to get out of here ? - What took you so long ? - All right , it 's nice to see you , too . My hand . Clothes . We check every room until we find her . Yeah . - Commence mass production . Start with nine hundred and eighty-six million vials . Prep Gen-Three for widespread contamination . - Doctor Locke , protocol is not- - - Do it . Here . Mandy ? Hey , hey , I 'm here now . Can you hear me ? I 'm back . I 'm getting us out of here . Let 's go . I 'll get the door . - We stockpile . Send all the vials to the Midwest Distribution Center . - Stockpile ? - Stockpile . - All right . We 've already come this far , why not ? Stockpile . Check it . Get the door . Hold up . Take her . - What ? - Take her . - Take her ? We are this close to getting out of here . - I 'm going to meet you at the third hatch entrance , okay ? - Come on . - Go - Dean , it 's not , come on . - Come on , let 's go . - Jesus . - Hey ! Initiate Gen-Three outbreak . - Let 's go , release . We got lockdown , all clear . Ah ! Systems are set . The world will always need someone to kill the masses , Dean . - Game 's over , Locke . - You 're not a soldier anymore , Dean . I told you this is not your fight . - You made it my fight . You can 't stop this , I can 't stop this . It 's much bigger than both of us . We 're just cogs in a giant wheel . This is destiny . Not mine . Oh ! - Life is about results , Dean . And it 's something you should now about me . I always deliver . - Consider yourself delivered . Code Nine . Contamination has been detected . Evacuate immediately . Code Nine . Contamination has been detected . Evacuate immediately . Stay with us , come on . He 'll be here any second . He 's here . You all right ? How is she ? In and out . Mandy . We made it . Come on , we got to get out of here . Hi , grandma . I tried . I tried to save you . And you ended up saving me . Thank you .

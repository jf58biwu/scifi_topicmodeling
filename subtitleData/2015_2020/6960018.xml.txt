The path to greatness usually takes hard work , and time . But in Dimension 404 , all Val needs is a sweet sip of Impulse 9 . You look all professional ! Yeah , yeah . - Careful , it 's ... - Hot ! No , thank you . Okay , you got your résumé ? And you wrote down the address , right ? I 'm just gonna wander around until I find the place . Look , I called in a big favor with your uncle Pedro to get you that interview . Plus you haven 't had a J-O-B in months . Thanks for the update , Dad . Gotta run . Hey , Val ? What ? Slow down , kid . When you get in there , just relax , ask lots of questions , and look ' em in the eye . It 's just some catering job , Dad . - I 'm not running for Congress . - Hey . It 's not about what you do for a living ... It 's what you do while you 're living . Okay , go knock ' em dead . And pick up Grandma from the doctor 's when you 're done . - Can 't you do it ? - It 's Tuesday , I work ' til closing . I love you . Love you too . Excuse me , ma 'am , I 'm looking for a girl named Speedrun . Gamer chick , sloppy hair , crappy clothes . Hey . So , what 's with the get-up ? Just some stupid job interview . Don 't you think maybe you should go to that ? And miss the invitational ? No , I 'll just call in sick or something . You get sick more than anyone I know . First prize wins ten grand ! I could move out and go pro . Yeah , about that . I guess you didn 't hear the news ? - What ? - You-Know-Who is making a surprise entrance today . No ! - Yup . - Come on ! May the gaming gods have mercy on our worthless souls . Killohertz is in the house ! I pity the chumps that have to rumble with this legend in today 's qualifying rounds . Really ? He 's got nothing better to do than flex his nuts at some Podunk tournament in Chino ? Yeah , what do you think he 's gonna spend the $ 10,000 on , designer shoes or more fingerless gloves ? Somebody should knock that stupid smug look off his dumb ugly face . Val . - What ? - You don 't have to win today , you just have to qualify , so keep it in your pants . But I can take him ! Babe , you 're really good , but he 's a legend for a reason . Which means if I beat him ... - Val . - Players , prepare for combat ! Play it smart . He 's a one man wrecking crew . And I 'm a one woman army . No-no-no , that 's not ... th-that 's not ... that 's not playing it smart ! And with that , the players are readied up and it 's time for the battle to begin . Speedrun with an impressive triple there , putting her on the board . Let 's go , Speedrun , yeah , Speedrun ! Crowd might be here for Killohertz but they 're giving some love to Speedrun . But here comes Killohertz with an incredible cross-map , nice , and he 's taking a moment to high-five the fans . The crowd is loving it and so is he . He 's taking his eyes off the screen ... Boom , unbelievable . A no-look execution ; This man is unstoppable . This match is not over yet but Speedrun is running out of time . Speedrun and Killohertz running away from the pack . These two are dominating . The match comes down to these two , up-and-comer versus seasoned vet , and the score is tied at 24 . The next kill wins the game . It 's all over , what an upset ! Speedrun has victory in her sights ! Wha ... wait , what is she doing ? My God , she 's gonna go for the glory kill . She 's seen Killohertz and she 's gonna chase after him instead ! Speedrun just had him in her sights . She 's rounding the corner , looking for the kill . He 's not there ... my God , Killohertz reads Speedrun like a book . What an ending ! That is one for the highlight reel . Another amazing match win for Killohertz . This guy is great . You had him ! That 's the match . Moving on to the finals are Val Hernandez and Roy Torvald . How the hell did he do that ? Nobody is that good , nobody . I know , it 's almost like he 's a one man wrecking crew or something . Um , but ... but congrats , babe , you made it to finals . Come on . You had an amazing game , babe . Yeah , but it wasn 't good enough , was it ? He wrecked me today . He 'll wreck me tomorrow too . Woo ! Hey . There she is . GG , Speedrun . I had you , man . Of course you did . Well , keep her warm for me , all right , son ? Woo , this guy looks like he wants a selfie . What a dick , right ? You gotta get in here and crush that turd bucket tomorrow . Smooches ? You 're a dork , Evan . A sexy dork ? That 's more like it . Okay , I 'm gonna go grab my car . Good game today . - Thanks . - Yeah . Sucks you 're gonna lose tomorrow . Who the hell are you exactly ? Your fairy godmother . Here , hold this . You know , you 're pretty good , Speedrun . Now you got guts but if you wanna win tomorrow , you 're gonna need some help . K ... Ko-ji ... Ko-ji-ma ? " Ko-jee-ma . " You know , you 're right about Roy . Nobody 's that good . All right , dude , what ... what 's your deal ? What the hell is this ? Call first , I got a lot goin ' on . How was the interview ? Fine . It was fine . You wanna try that again ? Pedro called . You didn 't even show up today . I was feeling woozy . I was gonna call in sick and ... Grandma . I almost lost my job today picking her up . Now what the hell happened ? There was a tournament today . It was a big one , I ... I couldn 't just miss it . I didn 't win but I played amazing . Well , congratulations . I hope you had fun because tomorrow you 're going down to your uncle 's and you 're gonna beg for an interview . No , I can 't , tomorrow 's the finals . Absolutely not . Dad ! This is my dream . Is this about the money , because first prize is ten grand . I mean , what does that stupid job pay anyway ? It 's not about the money , Val . And you lied to me . I trusted you and you completely let me down . Look , I know you have dreams , mija . I want you to achieve them . But I also want you to be a good person . I mean , do you think about anybody but yourself ? Yeah , I do actually . I think about you and I think about your crappy job and your crappy life and then I think , " I want to do the opposite . " Valerie , thin ice . No wonder Mom left . I 'll tell you one thing , the fans cannot wait to see these two go toe-to-toe again tomorrow . I said to call . Come on , follow me . Okay , I 'm not quite sure why I 'm here , but , you know , you said you could help , so ... Play . Why ? Thanks ? Okay . Okay . - Game start . - _ . Game over . Well , that sucked . Try it with this . An energy drink ? Seriously ? Yup . Just a normal , ordinary , nothing special about it , energy drink . Kanpai . Good , you 're back . Wh ... what happened ? When you drink Impulse 9 , you 're stretching time . The harder you stretch ... the harder you snap back . This time you lost about an hour . It 's like being blackout drunk , minus the drunk part . Holy shit . $ 500 a bottle , Speedrun . That is ... all my money . Plus 6.50 for the ramen . Wait , no , I can 't . I mean , it 's wrong , it 's cheating , isn 't it ? It 's definitely cheating . But is it wrong ? Roy doesn 't seem to think so . Hey , bro , what 's up ? What 's that , another case of Impulse for the match tomorrow ? You got it . Cash only , ATM 's in the front . Yeah , I 'm still here . Nope , nobody you know . Welcome to the final round of the Chino Hills Field of Fire Regional Tournament . In just a few moments we will crown one gamer the champion . Don 't worry , babe ... there 's plenty of me to go around . Go , Speedrun . Yeah , Speedrun . Now Speedrun Hernandez is on fire . She 's having the game of her life but , unfortunately , it 's just not enough to catch our leader , Torvald . Damn , that guy is impossibly good . What ? ! Speedrun ! What the hell ? Honey ? We gotta get ready , come on . Come on , I 'll take her . Mommy ? What ? ! I can 't ... Good morning , Mom ! Ew ! Hey , are you okay ? You 're not pregnant again , are you ? Out , I need out . Wait ... hey , Val , wait ! Val ! You forgot your gas mask , sweetie , here you go . Come on , kids , it 's time for school ! _ So I 'll be scavenging the wastelands until four then I gotta chop wood for the bug roast . You think you could pick up the kids before gate duty tonight ? - Val ? - Sure . Look , Daddy , I found a neat rock ! No , no , that 's a poop , sweetie , put that back . No , I want it !

Sheriff , Sheriff , caught myself a no-good ' Pulser . What 's going on , who are you people ? What ... why is it the apocalypse ? I 'll tell you why it 's the apocalypse . It 's because thoughtless slackers like you chugged too much Impulse and when you snapped back , the world went to shit , that 's why . I was ... I was studying for finals . " I was studying for fi ... " That 's what the president said when he snapped back with his finger on the button , you piece ... Okay , walk it off . What do you want from me ? Can you dress a wound ? Can you fix a generator ? Can you fend off a Death Lizard ? No . Then we got no place for you here . Ain 't that right , Sheriff ? Sheriff ? You all right ? Yeah . Send him away . - Send me away ? - Let 's go , pal , let 's go ! No , don 't send me away ! No , where are you taking me ? ! Where 's my mom ? ! Did I pass chem ? Anyway ... hi . What did you wanna tell me earlier ? Nothing . Are you okay , you seem a little off your game . I ... I think I 'm a little sick . You know , I think I might have a stomach ache . Yeah , I feel ya . I don 't think I cooked those beetles all the way through last night . - Good luck out there . - What do I do with this ? ! God ! Waste of a pointy stick if you ask me . Have a good day , honey . Smooches ? Looks like we 're in for some weather . See you at home , I love you ! My God . My God , wake up , my God . What do I know about babies ? I don 't know anything about babies . You 're not my baby . You 're not ! You 're my baby . What is happening ? What is happening , what is happening ? Dad , I need Dad , I need Dad . My God . Dad ? _ You 've got this , Val . You 're a bad-ass bitch . I need you right now . Keep it together . Sheriff ? Sheriff , let 's go ! Tick-tock , we 're late for latrine duty . Latrine duty ? As in ... scrubbing toilets . Hey , if you can call ' em that . But I 'm ... the sheriff ? I 'm the sheriff . Yeah , and sanitation commissioner and a scavenger and a mom . Hey , you got a lot going on , so shake a leg . Or do I have to toss you out into the wasteland ? - I 'm gonna go get ready . - All right , Sheriff . Come on , let 's go . - Couple minutes . - All right . Bye . Sheriff ! Open up ! How was your day , Mom ? Fine . It was fine . Look , Mommy , I made this for you . Great . At least it 's not a dog turd . Hey , Mom , did you know the green thing in plants is this stuff called chlorophyll ? Yup , I sure did ... look , Mommy 's really tired and she needs to get some sleep before her 5-hour guard duty , so if you two could just ... pipe down , it 'd be ... Guess what , kids , it 's ... - Game night ! - Game night ! Play Field of Fire with us ! No , you leave Mommy alone , she needs a nap . She 'll play with you next month , okay , buddy ? Next month ? I , could play one round . I mean , for them . " For them , " right . Be sure to grab some sleep before you gotta go on guard duty , okay ? Yup , yup . I 'm off to the bug roast . - Have fun ! - Okay . Bye , kids . Go , Speedrun , go ! Go , Speedrun , go ! Not bad for an old lady ? That was awesome , how are you so good ? Mommy , can you teach me how to play like that ? Hell yes I can . Come here , take a seat . Sit here . Okay , first we gotta learn the basics . Okay , that 's it , th ... that 's it . - You got it , you got it . - Okay , you got it , you got it . Wait-wait-wait , reload , reload , reload . - Come on , reload , yes ! - Val ! Val ? - Thank God . - Shit ! Okay , kids , I gotta go , all right , but keep practicing . Okay . Hey , hey . Where have you been ? I 've been looking all over for you . - What 's wrong ? - Come on . It 's Dan . He was pounding on the gate and a Death Lizard came . And you weren 't there to let him in . How could you ? ! It was game night . No , Val , wait . You still need to finish your shift . Hi . Hi . Come to bed , hon , you got work in the morning . I can 't do this , Evan . We toil and suffer all day and if we take an extra second for ourselves , a damn minute for a moment of peace , someone else might die ? I mean ... what the hell is the point ? Why even bother ? Val . For 12 years , you have been an amazing wife , you 're an incredible mother . You are the most fearless and thoughtful , responsible person I know . No I 'm not . Yeah . Hey . One mistake doesn 't change all that . Look , I could give you a speech about why we do what we do and why we work so hard but ... it 'd just be words right now . You have to figure that out for yourself . And I know that you will . I love you . Come to bed . I 'll be right there . Babe ? Honey ? " Dear Evan ... " " By the time you read this , I 'll be gone . " " It pains me to leave you and the kids , but ... " " I 've been living a lie . " " I 'm not the woman you married anymore . " " I 'm a ' Pulser . " " You remember that FPS tournament where I beat Roy Torvald ? " " That was last Tuesday . " " I thought I could hide . " " I thought I could hack it . " " But after last night , it 's clear to me " " why you send us ' Pulsers to the wastes to die . " " There 's just no place in civilized society " " for a teenage kid trapped in a grown-up 's body , " " so I 'm leaving . " " Maybe I 'll find another bottle of Impulse out there . " " But whatever I find , " " whatever this crazy , mixed-up world has in store for me , " " I want you to know that I always ... " Jesus Christ , Val . It 's hot . So hot . What was I thinking ? No way . Hey ! Speedrun ? Kojima ? You look rough . You look ... exactly the same . What the hell did you do ? Well , solar panels keep this place going . As for me , let 's just say I have my ways . So what brings you back to my neck of the woods ? I ... got kicked out of my suburb . Well , that sucks . Wait a minute ... did you just snap back ? Last week . Damn , girl , how much did you do ? You think this is funny ? Your drink ruined my life ! Yeah , we kinda ruined a lot of lives . - Yeah . - I know . Um , I 'll tell ya what , though . I get a lot of ' Pulsers in here , okay ? Some of them are old clients , some of ' em got it somewhere else , but I tell them all the same thing . Now ... I don 't do refunds , but ... I can give you store credit . Are you insane ? Dude , it sucks out there , man . Life is hard and short and death is usually slow and painful . Or ... chug this bad boy , sidle up to your favorite game , and go out doing what you love . And what happens when I snap back ? That 's best part . You won 't . Unless you live to be , like , 103 . So what do you think ? Do you have Field of Fire ? This way . Speedrun . See you on the other side . Look , Mommy , I made this for you . At least it 's not a dog turd . I mean , do you think about anybody but yourself ? No wonder Mom left . You are the most fearless and thoughtful , responsible person I know . I could give you a speech about why we do what we do and why we work so hard but ... you have to figure that out for yourself . And I know that you will . What ? Hello ? Hello ! Evan ! Evan ! Screw you , Val , get outta here ! No , Evan , please , wait ! - I ... I just wanna talk . - Bullshit , Val ! You just know it sucks out there and now you want back in . No , no , I did ... it 's not ... I do want back in , I do , but it 's not because it sucks out here . Goodbye , Val ! It 's not about what we get for ourselves . It 's about what we give each other . I wanna be that person ... in that drawing . I wanna be that . You gotta understand , a week ago I was 19 , I was kissing you at a tournament . I ... I 'm new at this , okay ? But I wanna make it work . I 'll ... I 'll ... I 'll ... I 'll scrub toilets , I 'll do guard duty , I 'll do double shifts . I 'll do whatever it takes to make it work . But I can 't do it alone . Do you have any idea what it 's like for 12 years of marriage to disappear in an instant ? No . I don 't even know how you proposed . Are you kidding ? You proposed to me . It was the best day of my life , Val . We can start over . Evan . I mean ... it 's not like it 's the end of the world . The hell is that ? - Death Lizards ! - They 're people ? ! No , Val , they 're giant radioactive lizards . Of course they 're people . Sound the alarm ! I got the gate , go get the kids . Come on , everybody , get the supplies , we gotta go ! - Where , where are we going ? - To the ravine . But we can 't go out there , it 's hell outside . Well , we have to . Our deputy 's dead and our sheriff is an Impulse junkie . They 're gonna knock down this gate and then they 're gonna kill everybody who 's left inside , so we have to go now . But this is our home . Not anymore . - Kids ! - Max ! - Go with your mom . - Sophia , come here . Come with Mommy , it 's okay , it 's okay . Be careful , stay ... stay by the wall . All right , stay with Mommy . Stay with Mommy , it 's okay , it 's all right . It 's okay . - Come on , come on . - Sheriff , we can 't outrun them , it 's hopeless , we 're all gonna die ! That 's not true , is it , Mommy ? No , no , no , of course not . You 're with Mommy , it 's okay , all right ? Val ! Come on , kids , come on . Hey , you guys . Guys . Val ! You have to listen to your dad , all right ? Okay , promise me ? Okay . All right . - Go . - Let 's go ! - Come on , Sophia . - Good girl , good girl . Val ? Head for the ravine , you 'll be safe there . - What are you doing ? - My job . I 'll hold them off for as long as I can . I 'll send a flare when it 's safe . You don 't have to do this . I love you . Go , go ! Go ! This is it ? One lousy bitch ? Roy ? I was wondering what kind of idiot stands in the middle of town square like a wannabe bad-ass . But duh ! Speedrun . Last chance , Roy . You need to crawl back to whatever hole you came out of . That 's not how it works , Speedrun . It works like this . First we 're gonna kill you ... and then we 're gonna eat you ... and then we 're gonna pay a little visit to that ravine over there where your family thinks they 're hiding out and we 're gonna kill them then we 're gonna eat them too . How many kids you got , Speedrun ? Judging by that body it 's gotta be more than one . You 're a monster . What can I say , wasteland changed me . Yeah , changed me too .

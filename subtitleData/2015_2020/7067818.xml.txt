[ female voice ] This way ? Okay . Thank you for waiting . WOMAN : What is the status ? Madam President . I 'm the Director of NOAA Space Weather , Ron Livingston , this is the Deputy Director and satellite liaison to NASA , Pamela Cushing . She oversees the Solar Dynamic Observatory . So what happened , and why were we caught with our pants down ? The sun blasted us with three waves radiation , ionization , and a violent coronal mass ejection . Sunspots more powerful than a billion thermonuclear weapons , traveling at over 1,000 kilometers per second . That 's what caused the spectacular aurora borealis as far as Panama . And that 's what destroyed our geodetic satellites . As well as our power transformers . We were utterly unaware and completely unprepared ? Madam President . Space Weather predicted heightened coronal mass ejections . SECRETARY : The record reflects their warnings . PRESIDENT : Well , it wasn 't enough ! PAM : Ma 'am , if I may . We recommend steps to mitigate the damage in case sunspots threaten the Earth again . If we directly link regional power systems to advanced warning from Solar Dynamic Observatory . We can build back a better infrastructure . These steps will cost money . Thankfully , our magnetic field deflected most of the sun 's discharge . My colleague and husband , Joshua Chamberlain , from the U.S. Geological Survey , can talk about the threat confronting our planet . Josh . Um . Hi . I 'm Joshua Chamberlain of the U.S. Geological Survey , and I 'm worried about a solar flare hitting our weakening magnetic field , Madam President . It is weakening . Dramatically . MALE : Excuse me . Sorry to interrupt . But ... JOSH : Dr. Zicree , sir . It is an honor and I was looking forward to talking with you about the Large Hadron Collider and helping us solve this problem . What exactly kind of problem do you think we 're having ? Well , over the past millennium our magnetic field has been decreasing by over 5 % per century , and in the last 100 years that accelerated to over 10 % . I 'd like to focus on preventing mega solar storms from destroying our nations infrastructure . That is what I am talking about , Madam President . JOSH : If our magnetic field were to dwindle or disappear entirely due to a polarity reversal , then the same storm would cause epic tectonic dislocation and atmospheric sputtering . And the end of all human life as we know it . Aside from just some downed power lines . [ laughs ] JOSH : Continents sinking . - RON : Chamberlain . Josh , sit down . - That 's why I propose jump-starting the Earth 's core . It 's impossible . That 's not impossible . You can use CERNS 's LHC and the Relativistic Ion Collider over at Brookhaven ... - What the hell does this have to do with sunspots ? ... dual singularities at both facilities , we can capitalize on the current retrofits . - Black holes . You want to create black holes in two particle colliders ? On purpose ? Are you serious ? RON : Chamberlain , that is enough . Yes . I believe the gravitons emitted , I believe would start the dynamo effect . Getting the earth 's core spinning again . Thus recharging the magnetosphere . Alright . Thank you , sir . If another solar flare hits our planet and our magnetic field is down ... ZICREE : If . - The earth would turn into Mars ! - Josh . Time to go . Would you please escort this man out ? - JOSH : No oxygen . No life . RON : You are through . Get him out of here . - That 's it . This is all happening right now and nobody cares about it .

Lucy picked up a repeating id beacon Over a decade old . Hey ! You said " hokk pong , " whoever wins gets to go onboard first . - You left , i made an executive decision . - You told me to go get d 'av to be judge and then you scoop me ? - That was my decision . It 's a cc warrant - claim and- - - Claim and clear . " any abandoned vessel found in non - territorial space can be boarded " by any rack agent in good standing .

System status ? Any idea what happened to this rig ? - Plugged into the top level bios . Telemetric engine 's cacked . Drive blew out , and crew hightailed it out . - Any idea where she 's from ? Haven 't seen any markings i recognize . - Beyond the quad maybe ? - Planet of origin info Should be printed on the transponder , which we will need For proof of our claim . - So ...

She retracted the bridge . What the hell is going on ? ! - I have no idea . - Lucy 's barely 50m away ; without a bridge , She might as well be 50 000 . - Why can 't we get a response ? Why won 't she come back ? - [ i don 't know . It 's like she sensed some kind of ... ] Contamination and went into full quarantine . - [ that 's deeply unnerving . ] Plus my deep suit 's gone missing . At least , our coms are working again . Thanks for that . - And i do have full access to all the security-cam feeds . I 'm working on access to lucy now . [ be careful with that guy d 'avin apprehended . ] - We 're just about to interrogate him . You want to tell us what 's going on , mister ... ? - Hogan . We 're just ship pickers , me and wilson . [ we picked up a beacon , same as you . Cargo ship , ] Origins unknown . Sounded like a big payday . Once we boarded , Our ship 's anchor line retracts . No way back . No engines . No coms . Nothing . - How long ago was this ? - Couple years maybe . More ? You lose track ... - We would 've been happy To get you out of here if your pal wasn 't too busy trying to hijack my ship . - Lady , you see what he did to my leg ? His fingers ? Poor bastard [ was spaced . Seen enough of it in the service . ] - D 'avin : [ you an officer ? ] - i worked for a living , son . Infantry . First and seventh , Howling mavs . - Mavs ? From korel ? You guys were in the ass end of the j . Skyborne . Royal syndicate . - Well , you don 't say ! The cavalry has arrived . Lead on , son . - D 'av ? Before we go bringing this guy onboard , what 's your gut on him ? - Considering how long he 's been stranded , I 'm not sure i 'd be any better off . Plus he 's infantry , They 're usually not known for their personalities . - I heard that . But as soon as you 're done insulting my beloved corps , Maybe we wanna figure out how to get the hell off Of this coffin ? - I 'm all ears . We have no contact with our ship , And my deep suit 's gone . - It must have been wilson . I still got ones Me and wilson used when we first boarded . - You have deep suits , and you never used them to get away ? - Ship was gone , so where to ? Nearest rock ? Here , let me show you where they are- - Argh ! Sorry . Leg . Dammit . - You need that looked at . You got an infirmary on board ? - Yeah , yeah , but it 's on the lower deck . Suits are upper level , aft . - Look , i 'll take mr . Hogan to the infirmary , Get him patched up . You go get the suits . We 'll meet back up in the engine room . - " omega clearance required . " Oh , you ... Fine . Be that way . ¶ ¶ ¶ ( electronic beeping ) - mm-hmm . ( sigh ) Hey , hey , hang on . Dutch , I think i got something here . - Any luck with lucy ? - [ not yet . I 'm resetting the ship 's signal system , ] But i don 't think that this is a cargo vessel At all . What does imur mean to you ? - Imperial marines of the united republic , out near the rim ? - [ exactly . ] And that 's why there 's no cargo . It 's military . - Military ? What kind of mission ? - I 'll go through the logs while the array resets . - Just do it fast . As soon as i find these deep suits , We are off . - Dutch ? [ you ok ? ] - stand by . I thought the old man said the infirmary was on the lower deck . ( breathing audibly ) Any chance you can put The heat on in the infirmary ? Room 's an icebox ... - [ sure . As soon as i 'm done with the logs ] [ and reconnecting to lucy . Hey , you want lunch too ? ] - That would be nice . - Always amazes me . Meet a new guy , serves on another planet - Whole other system even - same jokes , same crap . - The military is nothing if not predictable . What about you ? - Oh , you know . Same old story : Looking for fame and fortune ... Nice safe retirement . - And now that we have received the final batch , i am very Excited to begin our first procedure on live subjects . Oh ! Uh , just over there , please . - Stop ! What ? ! Hogan ? - Ah ! My guys all told me it was a dumb idea . Miss those idiots . Well , you know what they say . " you join for your nation , but you stay for your squad . " It 's alright , son . You 're here now . Whatever you were looking for , This is the answer . - Excuse me ? - [ d 'av , it 's john . Don 't respond . Just listen . ] - Trust me . - John : [ this old guy is not what he says . ] [ get to the engine room , now . Give me a signal you copy . ] - How , uh , how 's this ship for space rats ? - Hm . Nice . [ see you soon . ] - " space rats " ? The hell you talking about ? - Sorry . It 's old skyborne slang . We got a problem in the engine room . Sooner i can swing By there , the sooner we can get you to the infirmary . - Well , suit yourself . Elevator 's this way . ( sighing ) ( dutch gasping ) ¶ ¶ ¶ - Johnny , where 's d 'av ? - John : [ he 's on his way to the engine room . Why ? ] - How deep is this engine room ? - Don 't worry . When we get there , you 'll understand . Dammit , thing 's coming off . ( hogan moaning ) - I told you it would come undone the way that you tied it . - Sorry , son . ( grunting ) - ( d 'av ) : What the hell ? - ( hogan ) : We got work to do . ( groaning ) - Hey ! Hey ! What the hell is this ? ! - ( metallic voice ) : Prisoner 248-a , You will submit to questioning . Prepare for implantation . - Just relax . Trust me . - What the hell is this about ? Where is my crew ? - It will be their time soon . - Implantation commencing . - Well , i can 't say it 'll be ok . ( d 'av coughing ) But at least now , we 'll get to the truth , won 't we ? For instance , i never left the service . And i love my job . - What did you do to me ? What was that cloud thing ? - Just listen , you 'll see . - ( metallic voice ) : Prisoner 248-a , What is your name , rank And serial number ? - Go on . Tell him . - Name , rank and serial number . - I 'm not telling you anything . - Unacceptable response . - Son , i 've been a guard On this ship since she made her first skybreak . Trust me , you will talk . - Commencing persuasion . Dominant forearm . ( d 'av gasping and moaning ) Name , rank and serial number . - No ! Stop ! Ah ! - Name , rank and serial number . - D 'avin jaqobis ! Skyborne second shield , niner-five-six ! Stop ! - Commencing reconstruction . - There . That wasn 't so hard , was it ? ( coughing and gasping ) - I don 't know anything about it ! I don 't know anything about red 17 ! - Prisoner 23-b , what is your connection to red 17 ? - I don 't know ! I swear , you are crazy ! - Unacceptable . Commencing persuasion . Ocular region . - How many ? ( woman in video screaming ) - Dozens . Recordings are from years ago , But they 're all the same . Starts with easy questions And then gets more personal . Last stage is this - Red 17 . - Where the hell is d 'av ? - I don 't know , but he 's not answering his coms . I 'm searching the feeds for him . We 've got to find him , now . ( woman crying ) ( beeping ) - Can we check them on another monitor ? - Yeah , why ? - Because i recognize that woman . You gotta see this . - I get it . - ( hogan ) : Oh yeah ? Get what , son ? - Your ship . No cargo . No id . You 're not regular military ; You 're black ops . " enhanced interrogation . " You 're a torture unit . - Like i said , nice not to have to lie anymore . But you 're the one with questions to answer . - So where 's your crew ? What happened ? Come on . Soldier to soldier ... - Well , we were out on tour maybe six weeks When we ran through the path of a solar flare . Blew the engine right out . Started drifting . I got sent down to check the machine . That 's when it chose me . - Prisoner 248-a ... - No ! Wait , hold on . - First few weeks , you think ... Well , bad luck . Next few , you think , But maybe there 's a reason . - Prisoner 248-a , detail your last mission . - But that doesn 't matter now , son . - ( john ) : Come on , d 'av , where the hell are you ? You gotta be somewhere . - Most of these people have military id . It 's not just prisoners ; It 's the ship 's crew . What the hell did this to them ? - That cloud , it 's like some kind of drug ? - ( dutch ) : What kind of drug puts a hole in your head ? Or these other ones ? These people died From massive brain trauma . - D 'av ? Dutch , it 's him ! - ( dutch ) : Where is that ? - I don 't know , feed 's blank . This is just what 's coming through raw . Come on , give me some sound . - No , wait . Please . - We have to go . We have to go , to get him ! - Yes , we do , But we don 't know where he is and we don 't know what the hell is happening to him . That console is our only link to him - use it . Stop ! I don 't know anything . There 's no point ! - The captain said the same thing . " i don 't know what happened . It was an accident . You 're just a guard ! " So , i showed him the way , gave him his turn . - You killed your own captain ? - No ! I helped him . I helped them all To do their duty . - Commencing persuasion . Lower left abdomen . ( groaning ) ( coughing ) - D 'av ! D 'av , we 're here ! - The room must be shielded . It has to be why our coms don 't work . We 're cut off . - ( john ) : Come on , d 'av , give us a clue to where you are . ( d 'av moaning and panting ) - are you scared ? - Screw you ! - It 's ok . I was scared too . When you don 't know what 's going to happen . - Prisoner 248-a , Detail your last mission . - I know what 's happening . - Oh yeah ? What do you know ? - You start with simple questions , Then you get personal , looking for weak spots ... - Good . That 's right . - ... Until you break Them down . - So then you know There 's no point in lying about anything , is there ? Unless you 've got something to hide . Listen to me , son . I know you . Soldiers , warriors - we 're the same . - No ! - Trust me . It 's the only way . Tell me what you did . - Do you know what he 's talking about ? - No , no . Still looking for location here . - Prisoner 248-a , detail Your last mission . - It was a recon ! Simple sweep and sensor . Me and my squad . There was nothing ! Ugh ! - Go on . - I ... Can 't . - ( hogan ) : You just started . - ( d 'av ) : I can 't ! - ( hogan ) : What do you mean ? - I can 't ! I mean , i can 't remember ! I don 't know what it was about or how it started ! - Then what do you remember ? - Argh ! - What do you- - ? - I killed them ! - Prisoner 248-a , please explain in detail Who you killed and in what- - - my squad ! - Commencing reconstruction . - But ... Your own squad ? Son ... Why ? - I don 't know . I just know what i did . - ( john ) : We gotta shut down that machine . - ( dutch ) : How ? - ( john ) : Follow me . - ( hogan ) : You did good , son . You did real good . - Prisoner 248-a , What is your connection to red 17 ? - But we 're just starting . - What is this thing , johnny ? Gut instinct . - I don 't know , whatever it is , it ... It breaks things down , But then it builds them back up again . It 's biological Maybe or mechanical . It 's her . - She might give us something . - This is dr . Lyra grange . This is my final report . I don 't have much time . There are still so many of us- - - Prisoner 23-b , you are not authorized To leave your cell . - It 's the head guard , Hogan . After the accident , He completely decompensated . He lured the captain , The crew . There was a fight- - - prisoner 23-b , You are currently in Infirmary , starboard . Return to sub-level one for interrogation . - There , sub-level one , i 'm going- - - No , i am ! He 's my brother ! - John , you still need To figure out what the hell we 're dealing with here ! - Dutch , wait , wait , wait . - He used the nanites On all of us . - " nanites . " - There 's no way to override them . The interrogation program won 't stop . It just keeps going , I don 't know why . There 's no other way . ( gunshot ) - That 's one way to beat it . - I think i 've found them . You figure out how to shut it off ? - Advances in submicroscopic technology Allow the nanites to break down any organic matter In ways that mimic disease or trauma ... - We can 't shut it off . It 's just microscopic robots Programmed to tear us down , and then build us up Again and again . I mean , it 's a perfect torture device really . - And the program running them , when does it stop ? - That 's the thing . The accident didn 't just ruin The engine - it fried the whole system . It 's on a loop . [ torture , heal , torture , heal . ] i don 't think it knows how to stop . ] - So unless we destroy the program , the only way out Is to die faster than it can fix you . - That 's why mr . Crazy went out the airlock . He wasn 't trying to steal lucy ; he was just trying- - - to make it stop . - Prisoner 248-a , What is your connection to red 17 ? - I 'm telling you , i don 't know anything . - Unacceptable . - Come on , son . This is what it 's all about . We 've all been there . - What do you mean , " we " ? I 'm the one on the inside of this glass- - - You don 't think i 'd spare myself , do you ? That would be very unfair . I do my time . - You do this to yourself ? ! - Affirmative . Well ... I did ... After the crew ... My own men ... Took the coward 's way out , i was the only one left . Every day , i 'd come in ... And every day he asked me the same question , " red 17 . " And when i didn 't answer- - - ok . Ok , then at least tell me what red 17 is . - Oh , i have no idea . Need to know basis . Way beyond my clearance level . - They never told you what you 're looking for ? - Shouldn 't matter . Program will know . Program has to know . I mean , when it knew i didn 't have the answers , One day it just Stopped asking , Rejected me . But i 'm a good soldier , I knew the mission wasn 't over , So i set up a beacon To bring the curious , The greedy , the lost , like you . - Why do you keep doing this ? - Why ? I guess i just have faith , son . ( alarm ringing ) your friend tripped the alarm . Looks like it 's her turn now . - Dutch , no ! Get out of here ! Run ! No , look out ! - Didn 't even make me come running for you ... You are a thoughtful guest . - No ! No ! What the hell are you doing ? - Saving you . You 're welcome . - There 's nothing to " save " here . - Yeah . Saw as much in the infirmary . - That wasn 't ... That wasn 't what i wanted . They did that by their own hand . They were weak , gave up . - Prisoner 248-b , what is your name , rank and serial number ? - Dutch , it won 't stop . - I know . We saw and heard . - Did john ? - Commencing persuasion . Dominant forearm . ( dutch screaming and moaning ) - Dutch . ( panting ) - Alright , missy , you 're tough . But you saw your friend here , Heard what he said ... You know what 's coming . - You don 't know what i 've seen , old man , or what i know . I know what it means ... To be ashamed of what you did , of who you are . But i also know that whatever happened then , He is on my crew now , he 's my partner . - Prisoner 248-b , what is your name , Rank and serial number ? - And i know all about you . - Oh yeah ? What about me ? - I know you 're nothing . Just like the program running this whole thing now - Busted , broken . Just a glitch in the system . - No . I was the one who never gave up . He chose me . - And guess what ? I know about red 17 . - What do you mean ? What do you know ? ( charging building up ) - You 're dead . - Ah ! Argh ! Ah ! ( techno music ) ( alarm ringing ) - ( dutch ) : Time to go ! - How do you get out of here ? - D 'av ! Did it work ? - Prisoners 248-a and 248-b , you are not authorized To leave your cells . - Here , take your brother . - Prisoners 248-a and 248-b , return to sub-level one . - Still in me , i can feel them . - I know . - Where is she going ? Dutch ! Stop ! - D 'avin , wait ! ( emotional music ) - No ! - ( john ) : Move ! We got two minutes to set the mines . - She 's dead . - No . She 's strong . - Prisoner 248-a , You will now face ongoing persuasion until your return ... - What are you talking about , " strong " ? She 's in deep space with no suit , nothing , And those things are still inside her ! - And what do you think is keeping her alive ? The human body can 't survive in space . There 's no air . There 's no pressure . The radiation . Blood boils . Skin freezes . But the nanites repair anything short of brain death . - ( lucy ) : Crew proximity detected . Emergency protocol enacted . - They should keep her alive long enough to get to lucy , To plug in the manual override code . - When they 're done fixing her , they 'll tear her apart again . There 's no oxygen , there 's no time- - ( groaning ) - prisoner 248-a , You will now face ongoing persuasion Until you return to your cell . - I 'm sorry , but i love you . - No , wait , don 't ! Ugh ! How was that in any way loving me ? - Because it can 't fix you and torture you at the same time ! Massive injury triggers the repair phase . - Subject wounded . Commencing reconstruction . - See ? - And when they 're done fixing me ? Fine , but give me the gun . - Don 't bother . It won 't help you . - For the love of ... How are you not dead ? ( dutch gasping ) - Lucy , open the door to the hold ! - ( lucy ) : I 'm sorry , but quarantine protocols State you must remain in airlock one . - Lucy , i 'm in serious pain here ! - There are protocols , dutch . - Argh ! Ugh ! Lucy , i need To blow up that shit before these things rip me a new one ! - ( lucy ) : I 'm sorry , but quarantine protocols state You must remain in airlock one full hour before- - - lucy , john 's in trouble ! " favourites , " my ass ! I 'm taking over , you mechanical bitch ! - You belong here . You 're just like me . - No , i 'm not . - A good soldier . You killed your men , son , You have to atone . Here , You can face the past , Remember what you did . ( gunshot ) - That guy talks way too much . - Dutch : [ i 've connected the bridge to the aegir 's airlock . ] [ let 's go ! ] - we gotta get out to lucy . ( panting ) - John : [ dutch , we 're aboard ! Mines are about to blow . ] - Everyone good ? Ready ? Body about to explode ? Let 's go . ( engines roaring ) How much longer , john ? - Decon gas has to get in deep . How many millions of those things were in you ? - Fine . I swear lucy 's enjoying this . - ( lucy ) : Decontamination sequence complete . - Finally ! - ( lucy ) : Session 2 will commence in 10 minutes . - Oh , come on ! - ( lucy ) : It 's not My fault you 're filthy . - Watch it . - So ... Just whatever you wanna say , go ahead , Ask . - Why ? - Like i said on the ship , I can 't remember what i did- - - no , that 's not what i mean . I mean , why didn 't you tell me ? Why carry this all on your own ? This is why you ran away from all of us ? - John ... - ¶ because , because ¶ - You heard what i did . - Yeah . I can help . D 'av , i can do something . - How are you gonna help me , john ? - ¶ yesterday was hard on all of us ¶ - Well , there 's something to figure out , There 's something to fix and ... I like fixing things , remember ? - Yeah , i remember . - " space rats . " ( d 'av chuckling ) - you know , you really have To work on your moments . - Ha ! Yeah . - But , john ... Thanks . ¶ ¶ ¶ ( techno music playing ) You know , when you told me to take my shirt off , this is not exactly what i had in mind . - Shut up , jaqobis . You owe me a session . Last time i ran this , you had scarring all along the frontal cortex I assumed it was trauma , concussions , But now it 's all cleared away . - Well , i told you What those things were doing to me , fixing stuff . - I know but look here . - Alright , help me out . I missed neuro class in basic training . - Here , here and here . Those are neuro dampeners . Memory blockers . Very sophisticated . - How long have they been there ? - Hard to say .

 Four weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons ... rage ... grief ... fear . My God . Now , in order to survive , we must battle our most dangerous adversary ... the enemy within . 25 years ago , a team discovered fragments of what appeared to be an egg . Whatever was inside that egg altered their behavior . Hektor Martin ? Apparently , he 's the real head of Aktaion . Last update has you in Dr. Marston 's custody . The dome 's surface is calcifying , unless I can bring down the dome with Joe 's help . - You 're pregnant ? - It 's a girl . What are they all here for ? The future queen . Sam , with the right frequency and amplitude , it 's possible that the dome could shatter . Sam 's a part of the kinship , and I think he took Joe . The rest are at Coggin 's funeral home . Gather everyone you can and go there . We 're surrounded . This is where we make our stand . I 'm right here . Come back to me . Julia ? Oh , my God . Are you okay ? Did I hurt you ? I 'm okay , I 'm okay . Are you ? The shocks , I am so ... Julia , Julia . I chased you down . I tried to kill you . All of those things that I said , I didn 't mean any of it . Same here . Except how much I love you . I love you , too . You saved me from becoming one of them . You never gave up on me . I knew the real you was still in there . I am so sorry . Later . The Resistance . They 're hiding in the funeral home . They need all the help they can get . Hell , there are dozens of them . They 're everywhere . Stay away from the window ! That moves , shoot . What do I do ? Aim at the torches . Okay . It doesn 't work ! Safety 's on . They 're not coming to capture us . They 're coming to burn us to the ground . What the hell ? There 's somebody else out there , shooting . - Go , go , go ! Move ! Move ! - Get in there ! - Stay there ! - On the ground ! Who the hell are you ? Hektor Martin . He runs Aktaion . Look , I 'm here to help . Where can we take you to be safe ? Now ! All right , cover me . I 'll lead . We need to talk about this once , just the two of us . Yesterday was awful , okay ? Everything 's been pretty much a nightmare since you came out of those cocoons . We don 't have to do this now . Yeah , but we can 't pretend it didn 't happen . I know . What I don 't know is how we can get back to ... what we were , or if we even can . Look , things are different . Eva is pregnant . That baby is mine . Now , I 'm not gonna bail on being a father . That child is innocent of all of this . Barbie , your daughter ... Whoa , my daughter what ? Christine kept detailed notes on a voice recorder . It 's an instruction manual on how to use us to keep the life force alive . She made it for her successor , the next queen . And she paired you and Eva together for a reason . Your daughter is that queen . So Christine did this . I know it 's a lot to take in , but at least we have nine months to figure it out . Norrie , Jim . They were all in there . Stay here . I 'll check it out first . Good work bringing Joe back . When he took him to the funeral home , he said he thought the schematic was a way to bring the dome down with sound waves or something . That 's why Christine wanted him . We need Joe to start working immediately . I don 't see him cooperating . We have ways . Tell the others Norrie is not to be killed . Leverage ? If we need it . Joe . The kinship needs your help . The dome is calcifying , and for us to survive , we need you on our side . Never gonna happen . You backstabbing ass . Well , we tried nice . It 's possible nobody survived this attack . The only bodies are out here . Jim had other safe houses on his radar . Maybe they escaped . Yeah , or they were taken . If they 're alive , it won 't be for long . The kinship still thinks that I 'm a part of them , so why don 't I head down to town hall , and see what I can find out . Okay , I 'll go check out the other places the Resistance could be hiding . What if ... somehow they know you 're not one of them anymore ? Hey , they won 't . I can fake it . And if you see Eva again ? I was used . I was manipulated by Christine to father a child . The only thing that I feel right now is anger . So I 'm gonna get in there , I 'm gonna find out what we need to know , and I will come back to you . Okay ? Be careful . I will . You , too . Take this . Hey , if-if I 'm gonna pass with the kinship , they need to believe that I killed you , so if you 're seen , we 're done . Take my car . I 'm dead , can 't drive . Meet me at Hallorann 's Dock in two hours ? Yeah . Hey . Hey , Indy . Hey , boy . Let me look at that . Oh , you had my back , huh ? Good boy . I have an idea . Want to go find Jim ? I think I know which one of us he 's gonna be happier to see . Come on . Let 's go , boy . Let 's go . Limited doors , secured windows , closed-circuit camera . Set up base ! We 're holding up here with Aktaion ? Yeah . What about Joe ? We should go after him . Newsflash ... we 're being hunted . We just have to sit tight . No one said you could stay . This is my safe house . That 's a hell of a way to thank the man that just saved your life . I don 't owe you squat . Actually , you do . Dr. Marston . I sent supplies here for his rescue . He wasn 't at the funeral home , he 's not here . So where is he ? He 's stashed . In a safe place . Where ? I 'll take you to him . No , no , no , no , no . Just you and me . I 've never trusted anybody in a black suit , tie or otherwise . Jim , you don 't call the shots . Disarm him . Take me to Marston . What are we waiting for ? Back to work . Take care of the injured . Where 's Christine ? She 's at the Jacobsen 's farm , taking care of Eva . I know about the baby . Is everything okay ? Yeah , everything 's fine . Christine says they 're not to be disturbed . What about Julia ? It 's done . Where 's the body ? Buried at Shumway 's cabin . The Resistance still out there ? Unfortunately , but we have who we need ... Joe . You don 't know ? Our survival depends on a device that can bring down the dome , and Christine needs Joe to build it , but he refuses to help . Well , where is he ? No , I 've already tried . Take me to Joe . Hey , careful . That thing might be loaded . It is , but ... I don 't know how to use it . All right . Come here . Now , your safety , your slide , your front , rear sight for aim . Got it . All right , that oak , that 's your target . Tell me what to do . All right . Two-handed grip , your feet apart . Come on . Bend your knees . This ain 't Charlie 's Angels . Now aim ... and squeeze that trigger steady and slow . What the hell ? Noise will give away our location . I hope you never have to use it . You take a life , changes a person . So what if you need to shoot ? Silencer . Hi . Hi . I never thought we 'd meet in person , and now you 're here . Obviously , I 've got questions . What ? I saw you fall . Satellite surveillance . I 'm sorry . You 've seen a lot of other stuff , too . Yeah , that file you sent me was everything Aktaion had on the dome from day one . Why 'd you dump it ? I thought maybe one day we 'd need it . And the folder with the M.I.T. time-lock-level encryption ? Who 's gonna need that ? What ? An unnamed folder is buried in those files . Someone worked very hard to hide it . I didn 't know it was there . Do you think you can open it ? Okay , legend , I want to watch . See Hunter the hacktivist in action . Lily , the last time I saw you , you grabbed a hand cannon and booked it . Someone was chasing you , and you ran through the Red Door . It 's the only way to get here . What is ... ? I want to tell you , but I need to run it by Hektor first , okay ? Trust me . Oh , my God . - I warned Marston . - Yeah . Well , it was probably a raid . You saw the way they came after us . What was Marston doing here ? Why wasn 't he with you ? Hey , hey . I rescued him from those zombies , okay ? I told him to come with us to the funeral parlor , he wouldn 't be safe here . He said he needed to get back to his lab . Oh , damn it . If he 's dead and his samples are destroyed , then everything I came here for is gone . What 'd you come here for ? All right . There 's no more to see here . Sorry about your friend . Sorry doesn 't mean a damn thing . This isn 't about Marston anymore . This is about all those people . It 's about your son . What about Junior ? He was one of the first infected . This is it ! This is it , bud . We are putting Humpty-Dumpty back together again . Ah . Looks like a perfect fit . This makes everything we 've done worth it . Look ! It 's working ! This is the beginning . Clean , unlimited energy for the world . Unlimited clean money for us ! Patrick ? Patrick , what are you doing ? Uh ... There 's something drawing me to it . I ... Patrick ! - Patrick , what are you doing ? - It wants me to touch it . Patrick , don 't ! Remember Alaska ! Patrick ! No , Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick ! All right , so your friend 's an idiot . What 's that have to do with my son ? After Patrick touched the egg , he deteriorated . I hired one of the world 's leading epidemiologists to investigate . Marston ? That 's what he was doing here . Finding a cure . Without him , without DNA he collected from Christine Price , it ... And you . He e-mailed us meticulous notes . You gave him a hard time . After that , I never saw him again . We didn 't have any eyes inside the house , no satellite images of his ... kidnapping . We were on the move when this raid happened . Blind spots . And you ... you 're a killer . Men , women , young , old . Your hands are soaked with their blood . Hey , just , uh , calm down there , okay ? Hey . You killed him . Marston wouldn 't come back here if he knew there was a threat . Maybe Marston needed you . I don 't . Wait , wait , wait , wait . You shoot me , and you 'll never get what you want . What 's the first thing your company does when they send a unit into the Khyber Pass , huh ? They find a village or a local who can tell them things that no satellite can . Access , intel ... Christine 's DNA . Whatever you need , I 'm the only one that can get it . I 'm here now . No blind spots . You better deliver . Look , nothing you do to me will make me help you . There 's no reason for you not to help . The Resistance has been killed . Including Julia , thanks to Barbie . Is that true ? It 's true . Joe , it 's time you started working with us . You 're fighting for nobody but yourself . There 's nothing left for you but the kinship . - Okay , that 's enough . - Go to hell . That 's enough . I said , that 's enough . Hey , get out of here . He 's never going to listen to you . - Good cop , bad cop . I get it . - Okay . Joe , I am not one of them . Okay ? It 's really me . I didn 't kill Julia . She 's the one that brought me back . What about Norrie ? And the others ? I 'm hoping they 're still alive , but we got to get you out of here . I fell for this before with Sam . Look , I promise you , this is real . Come meet Julia with me . Joe , this is me . It 's the same guy that found you at the Sweetbriar after Angie died . I was there for you then ; I am here for you now . If I was one of them , wouldn 't I want you to stay here and build this thing ? All right , point taken . Welcome back . So , the dome ... is it calcifying ? Yes . Okay , then it 's sealing up . A-Air 's not gonna get through , and we 'll-we 'll suffocate . Barbie , I have to stay and build this device . What are you talking about , stay ? I hate to help the kinship , but it 's the only way out of here . And if I work with them and figure out how to build it , then everyone 's free . And then what ? I mean , Christine 's got to have other plans for us once this dome comes down . Well , I-I don 't know . But the longer we both work with them , the better our chances of finding out . And you know what 's going to happen to you after you build this thing ? Once they don 't need you anymore ? I 'll be killed . But if I don 't do this ... we 're all dead . Joe 's gonna work with us . Are you sure he 's not gonna ... He 's not your concern anymore . Put Sam on him . Copy that . Let me explain something to you . That , back in there ... that wasn 't good cop , bad cop . This kinship has a hierarchy ; we all have our place . Remember yours . Where you going ? If you 're headed to see Eva , Christine said no one 's to disturb them . I already told you that . Eva 's pregnant with my child . I 'm gonna make sure she 's okay . What did it feel like ... when you killed Julia ? Like I gave a great gift to our cause . So this stuff is gonna save Junior ? We 'll infuse the serum with Christine 's DNA , which contains a pure form of the infection . - Once injected , the infection ... - Sounds like voodoo . It 's based on cutting-edge research . Two days ago , I infiltrated town hall and almost assassinated one of the kinship 's highest ranking citizens . Let 's just say I 'm not one of their favorite people . Hard to believe . I go in there and get your sample from Christine , it 's a big risk . I don 't know if this so-called " cure " is worth it . - We can do it without you . - Yeah . - Three of my men were SEAL team . - Well , good luck . It 's your guys against 2,000 . You know , Jim , you 're not doing us a favor . Last time I checked , your backup was pretty weak . Besides , if you care anything about your son , it 's a risk you 'll want to take ... trust me . 'Cause what can happen will scare the living hell out of you . Orange moons ! C-Can 't breathe . Pink stars . So beautiful . Oh , pink stars falling . Falling in lines , falling in lines . Patrick , n-nothing 's falling . Okay ? You 're safe here . Launch them . Hurry . After the queen is born , the war begins ! Hurry , hurry ! Listen to me , listen to me . I 've got a team on this , okay ? They 're the best in the world . We 're gonna find a way to get you better . The eggs are important . You 've got to keep going ! He 's hurting himself . Shh . Hey . We 've got to keep him restrained . It 's for his own good . I 'll be outside . Hey . Hey , papa-dop . I brought something . Hey , listen , listen . Remember every Sunday , we 'd go to that coffee shop , read the paper and go to a movie ? Do you remember that ? I thought maybe the smell could take you back there . You 'd tell me ... " Plenty of time later in life for caffeine . " " One day , I 'll be happy if that 's the only drug you ever take . " Dad do you remember that ? It 's time ! It 's come . We will live on ! We couldn 't save him . Well , that 's a touching story . Any of it true ? Why would that be a lie ? I don 't know . Maybe someone 's trying to pluck on my heartstrings , uh , so they can further their own agenda . The only agenda we have is to cure this town . I know enough about your company to suspect that ain 't the case . Jim , Junior 's been infected for about a week . The longer you wait , the worse it 'll get . What happened to Patrick will happen to your son . - Freeze , don 't move ! - Hold it right there ! Put your hands ... Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Indy ! Hey , there you are , boy . Hey , Indy , how are ya ? Hey , what happened ? Don 't you worry . I know who did this . Hey , Jim . Over here ? Drop your weapons . Raggedy Ann 's with us . Lower your weapons . You don 't look like you killed a man . Didn 't have to . I got through to Barbie . Whatever infected him , it 's gone . That 's impossible . And you are ? Hektor Martin . Hektor founded Aktaion . He 's come bearing gifts . A cure for said infection . Well , whatever you brought , we don 't need it . Dale Barbara isn 't better . He 's in a dormant phase . Once an infection 's in a person , it 's there forever . It 's like chicken pox . Exactly . It can recur anytime . It happened to my partner after he touched an egg we found in Mexico . Once the dormant phases disappeared , the infection won out . Well , that was a different egg . So was the one in Alaska . You have no proof that what happened to your partner or those scientists will happen here . Could I talk to you inside , alone ? Julia . What if Hektor is right ? If this infection can come back , then we should go get Joe and Barbie so they can be cured . We don 't know Hektor . Or if what he 's saying is true . But we do know Barbie and Joe . Barbie is the same guy he was before the cocoons . Isn 't Joe ? Yes . But Sam was himself , too , and then after he was with Christine , he went back to being one of them . But Joe is strong ; he 's like you . Right after the cocoons , I was with all of them , and I felt this pull to the kinship . Barbie is at town hall . He 'll find Joe , and they 'll come back . We just need to trust them . Good work leaving the clue at the funeral parlor . The baby bottle was brilliant . I was looking out for you . And now I want to do the same for Joe . Why are you working with the people who captured and tortured you ? After everything that has happened under this dome , now Aktaion 's here to help ? I don 't think so . I don 't trust ' em . But they didn 't blow my brains out , okay ? And on the outside chance they do have a cure , Junior 's gonna be first in line . I mean , don 't you want a vial waiting for your boyfriend ? I told you , he doesn 't need it . Love saved him . Yeah , go ahead and laugh . Love saved him , I see . Yeah , so love trumps five years of medical research ? I 'll tell you , I have $ 1,000 that , uh , Barbie 's back at town hall making more babies with Eva . She 's still alive ? What happened to plan B ? Didn 't work out . Hell . I 'll be back . I got to go meet Barbie . Joe 's a double agent . And all we have to do is stay alive until he builds Christine 's device , assuming it works . Well , it better . Because the dome is calcifying . If it doesn 't come down , then we 're all dead . And Aktaion 's alleged cure , that won 't even matter . All right , you ready to go meet Hektor ? Actually ... there 's something else that I need to do . Christine took Eva out to Jacobsen 's farm . And you want to go out there . I 'm just worried about the baby . Is that all ? Julia ... How was it , being back with the kinship ? Did you feel any kind of a pull ? No . There was nothing at all . I don 't want you to go . I want you to come back to the Resistance with me . But I understand why you need to . I respect it . You 're gonna be a great father . The baby ... I just wanted that to be us . I know . Me , too . Julia , I am with you . And you need to trust me . I do . I just don 't trust them . When will you be back ? As soon as I can . Okay ? Stop touching me . I 'm tired of being cooped up in this filthy barn . Eva , try to relax . I can 't . Where 's Dale ? He left to kill Julia hours ago . What if he couldn 't do it ? What if they 're out there right now together ? The anxiety you 're feeling is normal ... about becoming a mother , about the unknown . I felt the same way . - This is different . - Of course . You 're carrying the queen . But Barbie is your mate . And once he sees you , he 'll never leave again . Christine is making sure of it . Charlotte . You 're the first . Are you ready ? Yes . Here . The queen needs you . So don 't be frightened . What happens next will be beautiful . This is it ? How am I supposed to figure this out without the proper tools ? There are seven amethysts here . It 'll have to do . It 's all you could get , isn 't it ? Because you 're that low on the totem pole . Babysitter duty . Just a slave who does whatever he 's told . Hell , you even have to do whatever I tell you . Your words don 't mean anything to me . When I gave myself to the kinship , my guilt , my shame , and the need for your forgiveness melted away ... What are you doing ? Isolating frequencies , trying to see if I can break that bowl . - Is that necessary ? - It is if I say so . - You 're alive . - I 'm hugging you , aren 't I ? Is that a gun ? Yeah , I 'm breaking you out . Okay , if we distract Sam , then you can go out that door by the old jail . What is that ? - Are you helping them ? - Yeah . But I 'm not one of them . Like , it 's me . Look how happy I am to see you . Well , then why are you doing this ? My theory was right . The schematic shows how to bring the dome down . And then we can finally be together out of Chester 's Mill in the real world . Not some fake-ass reality where someone 's pulling our strings . So you 're gonna stay here then ? I got Barbie looking out for me . And it 's kind of badass . Yeah , it is kind of badass . Come here . Look , you got to go . - Sam could come back any time . - Okay . Guilt 's a powerful motivator , isn 't it ? This dome is here because of you . I saw that footage of Christine and Eva when they found the egg and what happened next . They work for you . Yeah , when I sent them in , I had no idea that a dome would come down . It never happened before . But you did know they could get infected . That 's why we kept working on a cure . I knew I couldn 't save my best friend , but maybe I can save the 2,000 people that we put under here . I got something for you that 's bigger than a cure for this infection . There 's a way out of here . How ? Christine Price . She 's planning on bringing the dome down . I saw a schematic . Maybe ... maybe that drawing 's the key . I don 't know . Then they kidnapped Joe McAlister . He 's a smart kid who was already working on a way out . All right , so what are you proposing ? I get you the DNA sample you need to complete your formula ... you cure the town . When the dome comes down , we 're both heroes . Deal ? Yeah , deal . Oh , and , Hektor ? Don 't get any ideas about double-crossing me . Hey , hold up . - Let me in ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa , hey ! Come on . She 's kicking . Wow . Christine made it happen . With the help of some very young devoted women . I-I don 't even know what to say . Your face says it all . Dale , we 're gonna be a family . Our daughter 's destined for greatness , and she 's gonna be here any day . We need to make sure she 's safe . Yeah , of course . Did you take care of Julia ? Is she dead ? Julia won 't be a problem anymore . I-Is something wrong ? No . No . Hey . I am just as excited about this as you are . Come here . - You find anything under the cabin ? - No . But something real bad went down inside . Yeah , but that doesn 't mean that Julia 's dead . Barbie said he buried her around here , but there 's no grave . All right , you think we should keep looking ? You know what I think ? I think Barbie lied . He 's a traitor to the kinship . You go back to town . I 'm telling Christine . What are you for ? Okay , Lily , let 's crack this folder . Let 's play . _ Lily 's dad ? I thought he was dead . This ... this was four days ago . What Jim said about a way out ... Lily . I know when we came here , we thought it would be forever , but ... if he 's right , we could have a happily ever after . We know too much . I promised your father that I 'd keep you safe . This is the only place that nobody can get to us . So , deal or no deal , I 'm gonna do whatever it takes to make sure that this dome never comes down . The team is all geared up for Chester 's Mill . Just confirming your supply order . As much as we can carry . We 're not coming back . I 'm sealing off this wing . Is the Red Door set ? Explosives are all in place . Military will not be able to follow us . Hektor . I have to go . I can 't take you with us , but , look , I-I promise I 'll-I 'll keep Lily safe , okay ? I 'm-I 'm sorry , Patrick . Hektor ! Hektor ! Julia , what are you doing here ? Never mind that . What are you doing ? What happened to those girls ? They pledged their vitality to the queen and safeguarded the future of the kinship . - You mean they were sacrificed . - Guard ! Harriet . Don 't . I 'm your friend , okay ? You 're a threat to Eva 's baby , Julia , and you must be taken care of . Guar ... All right , come on . Let 's go share our good news with the town . I 'm sure they 'll be as happy as we are .

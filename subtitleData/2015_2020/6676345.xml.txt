 There was a time above . A time before . There were perfect things , diamond absolutes . How things fall . Things on Earth . And what falls ... Master Wayne ! - ... is fallen . - Bruce ! Bruce , it 's all right . Bruce , please . Martha . In the dream , they took me to the light . A beautiful lie . - Jack . - Bruce . Jack , listen to me . I want you to get everyone out of the building right now . - You understand ? - Oh , my God . Stay away from the windows ! Let 's go . Come on . Start moving now , people . Let 's go . The boss wants us out of the building , so let 's make it happen . Jack . Jack ! We 're sorry . All circuits are busy now . Will you please try your call again later ? Heavenly God , creator of Heaven and Earth , have mercy on my soul . Jack ! Mr. Wayne ! Mr. Wayne ! I can 't feel my legs . I can 't feel my legs . We need help over here ! Help me . I can 't feel my legs . You 're gonna be okay . You hear me ? Wallace ? What do they call you , Wally ? You 're the boss , boss . All right . You 're gonna be okay . Easy , easy . Come on . Oh , my God . I can 't move my leg . My God . I can 't feel my legs . It 's okay . You 're gonna be okay . You 're okay . All right ? Huh ? You know what ? We 're gonna find your mom . Where is she ? Are you a terrorist , General ? They did not tell me the interview was with a lady . I 'm not a lady . I 'm a journalist . What I am is a man with nothing except a love of my people . Don 't open ... You just exposed ... Who 's paying for these security contractors , General ? Who pays for the drones that pass over our heads at night ? One question begs another . Yes ? CIA . They 're tracking us ! You ! No ! It 's okay , Lois . I ... I didn 't know . Ignorance is not the same as innocence , Miss Lane . Get up ! Stand up ! Move out ! Take one step , you will see the inside of her head . The women in the village heard a noise . Like the sky cracked open . He came down . So many dead . Even worse came after . The government attacked . No mercy in the villages . My parents tried to run . The world has been so caught up with what Superman can do that no one has asked what he should do . Let the record show that this committee holds him responsible . He 'll never answer to you . He answers to no one . Not even , I think , to God . - Hey . - Hey . I was gonna cook . Surprise you . They held hearings about what happened . - They 're saying that ... - I don 't care . I don 't care what they 're saying . The woman I love could have been blown up or shot . Think of what could have happened . Well , think about what did happen . I didn 't kill those men , if that 's what they think . If that 's what you 're saying . No , I 'm saying I want to understand what happened . I 'm saying thank you for saving my life . I 'm saying there 's a cost . I just don 't know if it 's possible . Don 't know if what 's possible ? For you to love me and be you . Clark ! Clark , you 're going to flood the apartment . Mmm-hmm . Go . It 's okay . It 's okay . We 're gonna help . We 're here to help . We 're gonna get you out of here . Okay ? I don 't understand . Please don 't . Please don 't . Please . I don 't know who he is . I don 't know who he is ! No ! Oh , fuck . Christ ! I saw him . I never saw him before . I ... I didn 't know . You almost took my face off . How about you don 't shoot the good guys , huh ? Oh . Jesus Christ . He branded him . You still working ? You 're getting slow in your old age , Alfred . Comes to us all , Master Wayne . Even you got too old to die young . And not for lack of trying . Funnel-ferry butterbar . Funnel-ferry butterbar . Funnel-ferry butterbar . Funnel-ferry ... There 's nothing wrong with the microphone . It 's this new layer of armor . I 'll just have to rewire . So , last night was productive ? No . He 's too low-level . He knew nothing . This is the man who knows things . Anatoli Knyazev . He 's Russian . Contracts all over the globe , but he 's based out of the port of Gotham . Weapons and human trafficking . So the White Portuguese is a Russian . That 's the theory . No . The theory is that the Russian will lead me to the man himself . If he is , indeed , a " him . " You don 't even know if he exists . Could be a phantasm . One that wants to bring a dirty bomb into Gotham ? High-stakes round . New rules . We 're criminals , Alfred . We 've always been criminals . Nothing 's changed . Oh , yes , it has , sir . Everything 's changed . Men fall from the sky . The gods hurl thunderbolts . Innocents die . That 's how it starts , sir . The fever . The rage . The feeling of powerlessness . It turns good men cruel . Justice turned dark across the harbor , when police found an alleged sex trafficker apparently tortured and branded by the Gotham Bat . The man is the second criminal found bearing the Bat Brand . The first victim , an accused child predator , later was assaulted in prison , and remains in critical care from his injuries . One source tells Metropolis 8 that many believe the mark of the Bat Brand in prison , essentially , is a death sentence . In other news , the mayor has announced ... John , get D. Ooh . Ah . Ahoy , ahoy ! I did not know you were here . - Man on the marquee . - Yeah , don 't believe it . My father named the company after himself . He was the Lex in front of the Corp. How you doin ' ? Oh , really great . Really great ? Good . Good . Uh , follow me . You know , Dad was born in East Germany . He grew up eating stale crackers . And every other Saturday , he had to march in a parade and wave flowers at tyrants . So , I think it was providence that his son , me , would end up with this . One of my Rebuild Metropolis crews found it . Little souvenir from the Kryptonian World Engine . What does a rock have to do with homeland security ? Homeland security ? No , no , no , ma 'am , planetary security . The fragment is of a radioactive xenomineral . We suspected it might have bio-interactions , so we took the sample to AMRIID , where they keep the remains of the Kryptonian decedent . And , when we exposed General Zod to the mineral , this happened . Profound biodegradation . Decaying Kryptonian cells . We concluded the mineral could be weaponized if a large enough sample was found . And then , among the fishes , a whale . Ah ! Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean . Emerald City . Beautiful . Now , Rocky is radioactive , but what he needs from you is an import license . And why would we want to weaponize this material ? As a deterrent . A silver bullet to keep in reserve , to use against the Kryptonians , so the day does not come , madam , when your children are waving daisies at a reviewing stand . Last I looked , the only one of those flying around up here was Superman . Ha-ha , yes . Superman . Yeah , but there are ... There are more of them . The metahuman thesis . Yes , the metahuman thesis . More likely than not these exceptional beings live among us . The basis of our myths . Gods among men upon our little blue planet here . Now , you don 't have to use a silver bullet . But if you forge one ... Well , then we don 't have to depend upon the kindness of monsters . Sir , get down . Sir , I said get down ! Now ! Can we get some backup here ? Hey ! Hey ! Don 't do it ! Hey ! Lois ! Crime lab , on three . - This is Lane . - Kent . You 're Sports today . I want you to follow up on football . " Underdog Dreams Dashed : Ten Yards Between Gotham and Glory . " Hey . Are you guys watching this ? Emergency responders quickly created a precautionary perimeter around Heroes Park while they brought the man down from this beloved monument . The suspect has been identified as Wallace Vernon Keefe . I work for Bruce Wayne ! I work for Bruce Wayne ! He 'll be arraigned on charges of vandalism , resisting arrest , and the felony charge of making terrorist threats . That carries up to 40 years in prison . Poor son of a bitch . Metropolis News 8 . - Jenny . - Hmm . Headline , " End of Love Affair with Man in the Sky , " question mark . " Okay . There are ways we can help each other . Would you step into my office here ? Yes . What 's your wish list ? Access to the wreck of the crashed Kryptonian ship ? Done . The complete remains of the dead alien for testing . You want Zod 's body ? Okay . Mmm . It 's cherry . Mmm-mmm . Show ' em what you got ! Let 's go . Come on ! Throw a punch , will ya ? Let 's go ! Come on ! Thank you . The house treats luck like an insult . Good luck for one is always his brother 's misfortune . Three nights with a Bolshoi ballerina , that line was all she taught me . Not all , I 'm sure . Good evening . It 's like a one-man reign of terror . This Bat vigilante has been consistently targeting the port and the adjacent projects and tenements . And , as far as I can tell , the cops are actually helping him . " Crime Wave in Gotham . " Other breaking news , " Water , Wet . " Did you file the football yet ? Why aren 't we covering this ? Poor people don 't buy papers ? People don 't buy papers , period , Kent . Perry , when you assign a story , you 're making a choice about who matters . And who 's worth it . Good morning , Smallville . The American conscience died with Robert , Martin , and John . Sorry . I 'm sorry . No match . My guys in the crime lab never seen one before . It 's called a bullet . You shoot people with them . Recovered from the scene of the firefight in the desert . Not sold anywhere commercially in the world , even black market . So ? So who gave prototype military rounds to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara ? The Ask , Lois . Flight to D.C. tonight . Couple of days there . Go . Coach . No extra legroom . Economy plus . Coach ! Senator . My dad always said that Kentucky mash was the secret to health . Mmm . This was his room . I left it just the way it was . That 's silly . The magical thinking of orphan boys . I 'm blocking the import license for your mineral . The redcapes are coming . The redcapes are coming . Hmm ... You and your hearings . Galloping through the streets to warn us . One if by land , two if by air . Mmm . Do you know the oldest lie in America , Senator ? Can I call you June ? You can call me whatever you like . Take a bucket of piss and call it Granny 's Peach Tea . Mmm-hmm . Take a weapon of assassination and call it deterrence . You won 't fool a fly or me . I 'm not gonna drink it . You don 't think Dad would mind , do you ? If I changed just ... Just one thing in this room ? Because that should be upside-down . We know better now , don 't we ? The devils don 't come from Hell beneath us . No . No , they come from the sky . Wrong room , miss . Secretary Swanwick , you haven 't been returning my phone calls . Miss Lane , if you 'd like an interview , Major Farris is just outside that door . You 're treating me like a stranger ? I 'm treating you like a reporter . All right . Is the US providing experimental military arms to rebels in Africa ? You know , with balls like yours , you belong in here . What 's your source on this ? A tin foil hat ? No , not tin . But it 's metal . Fired in the Superman incident . Experts at the Pentagon can 't ID it . We haven 't been told the truth . Here 's the truth . A reporter got greedy for a scoop and went where she shouldn 't have . Superman acted like some rogue combatant to rescue her , and people died . Don 't invent a conspiracy theory to put back his halo . Or yours . - Major . - Sir . Oh . I hope the next generation of Waynes won 't inherit an empty wine cellar . Not that there 's likely to be a next generation . Thank you , sir . This is every call made from the Russian 's phone . Two mentions of business with the White Portuguese . And it 's continually transmitting blacked-out data to the personal residence of Alexander Luthor . You think Lex Luthor is the White Portuguese ? I can 't see that he needs the income from imported arms . Regardless , I 'll need to put a leech at his house , and I 'm gonna need the suit . The Bat interrogated six people and came away with nothing . It was Bruce Wayne that got the information . Well , Bruce Wayne can 't break into Lex Luthor 's house . Bruce Wayne won 't have to . He 's been invited . Who 's that ? You must be new to the " let them eat cake " beat . That is Bruce Wayne . Philanthropist , bibliophile ... True friend of the Library of Metropolis , Mr. Lex Luthor . Me ? Ah . Okay . Nicky . Uh ... You 're embarrassing me . Um ... Speech , speech . Uh ... Blah , blah , blah . Uh ... Open bar . The end . Uh ... The word " philanthropist " comes from the Greek . Meaning a lover of humanity . It was coined about 2,500 years ago . All right . Where am I going , Alfred ? Go past the elevator . Do a left . That 's right , must be . It 's in the service corridor in the basement . Go down the stairs . Gods and men . Prometheus went with us . And he ruined Zeus ' plan to destroy mankind , and for that he was given a thunderbolt . Hmm , that seems unfair . On a serious note , the Library of Metropolis ... Go to the stairs . You saw them on your way in . Down the stairs . But at one time , Dad could not buy them . No . My father could not afford books growing up . He had to root through the garbage for yesterday 's newspaper . All right . You got the kitchens on your right . Do a left . Right in front of you . That 's where you want to be . May I help you , Mr. Wayne ? I just ... I thought the bathroom was down here . I must have ... That last martini was two too many , I think . Men 's room is upstairs . Great . I 'm okay . I like those shoes . I can 't stay down here , Alfred . Go upstairs and socialize . Some young lady from Metropolis will make you honest . In your dreams , Alfred . Books are knowledge , and knowledge is power , and I am ... No . Uh , um ... No . What am I ? I ... What was I saying ? No . The bittersweet pain among men is having knowledge with no power , because ... Because that is paradoxical ! And , um ... Thank you for coming . Please drink . Drink . Mr. Wayne ? Mr. Wayne ? Clark Kent , Daily Planet . My foundation has already issued a statement in support of books . - Sir ? - Um ... Wow . Pretty girl . Bad habit . Don 't quote me . All right ? What 's your position on the Bat vigilante in Gotham ? Daily Planet . Do I own this one ? Or is that the other guy ? Civil liberties are being trampled on in your city . Good people are living in fear . Don 't believe everything you hear , son . I 've seen it , Mr. Wayne . He thinks he 's above the law . The Daily Planet criticizing those who think they 're above the law is a little hypocritical , wouldn 't you say ? Considering every time your hero saves a cat out of a tree , you write a puff piece editorial about an alien who , if he wanted to , could burn the whole place down . There wouldn 't be a damn thing we could do to stop him . Most of the world doesn 't share your opinion , Mr. Wayne . Maybe it 's the Gotham City in me . We just have a bad history with freaks dressed like clowns . Boys ! Um ! Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent . Ha ! I love it . I love bringing people together . How are we ? - Lex . - Hello . Good . Hi , hello , Lex , it is a pleasure . Ow ! Wow ! That is a good grip ! You should not pick a fight with this person . So , after all these years , we finally got you over to Metropolis . Well , I thought I 'd come drink you dry . Well , you 're welcome . You should hop the harbor more often , though . I 'd love to show you my labs . Maybe we could partner on something . My R and D is up to all sorts of no good . That 's seven minutes . Looks like the transfer 's complete . - Mr. Luthor . - Yes ? - The governor . - Governor . - Excuse me . - Next time . Governor ! Hi ! Lex , it 's good to see you . Excuse me . VIKRAM We , as a population on this planet , have been looking for a savior . 90 % of people believe in a higher power , and every religion believes in some sort of messianic figure . And when this savior character actually comes to Earth , we want to make him abide by our rules ? We have to understand that this is a paradigm shift . We have to start thinking beyond politics . Are there any moral constraints on this person ? We have international law . On this Earth , every act is a political act . Is it really surprising that the most powerful man in the world should be a figure of controversy ? To have an individual engaging in these state-level interventions should give us all pause . Human beings have a horrible track record of following people with great power down paths that led to huge human atrocities . We have always created icons in our own image . What we 've done is we project ourselves onto him . The fact is , maybe he 's not some sort of devil or Jesus character . Maybe he 's just a guy trying to do the right thing . We 're talking about a being whose very existence challenges our own sense of priority in the universe . And you go back to Copernicus , where he restored the Sun in the center of the known universe , displacing Earth . And you get to Darwinian evolution , and you find out we 're not special on this Earth , we 're just one among other lifeforms . And now we learn that we 're not even special in the entire universe because there is Superman . There he is . An alien among us . We 're not alone . Are you , as a United States senator , personally comfortable saying to a grieving parent , " Superman could have saved your child , " but on principle , we did not want him to act " ? I 'm not saying he shouldn 't act . I 'm saying he shouldn 't act unilaterally . What are we talking about here , then ? Must there be a Superman ? There is . Keefe . You made bail . Open two . Who paid ? Who the hell are you ? Just a man . Yeah ? Well , what do you want ? To help you stand for something . Your 3 : 00 is here . He made me half a man . Let me face him . So . I logged into your Dropbox to find copy . There 's copy all right . But nothing about football . Nothing about the friends of the Metropolis Library , just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing I told you not to pursue . If the police won 't help , the press has to do the right thing . You don 't get to decide what the right thing is . When the Planet was founded , it stood for something , Perry . And so could you if it was 1938 , but it 's not 1938 . WPA ain 't hiring no more . Apples don 't cost a nickel . Not in here , not out there . You drop this thing ! Nobody cares about Clark Kent taking on the Batman . It 's the Sword of Alexander . It 's the blade that cut the Gordian knot . It 's a triumph . Yes . - Enjoy . - Thank you . It 's a fake . The real one was sold in ' 98 on the black market . And now it hangs ... Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar . Excuse me . Excuse me , miss . The other night you took something that doesn 't belong to you . Stealing 's not polite . Is it stealing if you steal from another thief ? Who are you ? Someone interested in the same man you are . Is that right ? I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph that belongs to me . Did you get it ? As it happens , no , I didn 't . The data you copied has military-grade encryption . You know , I bet with that dress , 9 out of 10 men will let you get away with anything . But you 're the 10th ? I 'm guessing I 'm the first to see through that babe-in-the-woods act . You don 't know me , but I 've known a few women like you . I don 't think you 've ever known a woman like me . You know , it 's true what they say about little boys . Born with no natural inclination to share . I didn 't steal your drive . I borrowed it . You 'll find it in the glove compartment of your car . Mr. Wayne . Did you get it ? The rock ? Yeah , we got it . I 'm sorry . Get down ! Get down now ! No ! She was my world . And you took her from me . Bruce ! Bruce ! Listen to me now ! It 's Lois ! It 's Lois Lane ! She 's the key ! Am I too soon ? I 'm too soon ! You 're right about him ! You 've always been right about him ! Fear him ! Fear him ! Find us , Bruce ! You have to find us ! The White Portuguese is not a man . It 's a ship . Master Wayne , since the age of seven you have been to the art of deception as Mozart to the harpsichord . But you 've never been too hot at lying to me . The White Portuguese is not carrying a dirty bomb . What is it carrying ? It 's a weapon . It 's a rock . A mineral capable of weakening Kryptonian cells . The first sample big enough to mean something turned up in the Indian Ocean three months ago . It is now aboard the White Portuguese being delivered to Lex Luthor . Who I am going to steal it from . To keep it out of Luthor 's hands . To destroy it . No . You 're gonna go to war ? That son of a bitch brought the war to us two years ago . Jesus , Alfred . Count the dead . Thousands of people . What 's next ? Millions ? He has the power to wipe out the entire human race , and if we believe there 's even a 1 % chance that he is our enemy , we have to take it as an absolute certainty . And we have to destroy him . But he is not our enemy . Not today . Twenty years in Gotham , Alfred . We 've seen what promises are worth . How many good guys are left . How many stayed that way . Kent , I want to talk to you . Kent ! Where does he go ? Where does he go , Jenny ? I don 't ... I don 't know . Clicks his heels three times , goes back to Kansas , I suppose . Son of a ... I don 't have a halo over me , Mr. Secretary . I went into the desert , people died . It keeps me awake . It should . If you think that Superman is a murderer , then throw it away . But I don 't believe you think that . Move out ! Go , go , go , go ! No ! Where is he ? Next time they shine your light in the sky , don 't go to it . The Bat is dead . Bury it . Consider this mercy . Tell me . Do you bleed ? You will . How do we determine what 's good ? In a democracy , good is a conversation , not a unilateral decision . So I urge Superman to come to this Hill of the People tomorrow to see those who have suffered . The world needs to know what happened in that desert . And to know what he stands for . How far will he take his power ? Does he act by our will or by his own ? People hate what they don 't understand . But they see what you do , and they know who you are . You 're not a killer , a threat . I never wanted this world to have you . Be their hero , Clark . Be their monument . Be their angel . Be anything they need you to be . Or be none of it . You don 't owe this world a thing . You never did . C.I. thinks the desert was a setup . Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty . The bullet ? The metal was developed by a private company . What company ? LexCorp . Lex Luthor ? He also had private security contractors at the desert compound . Go on record . Not a chance . It 's classified . I happen to like my job . It doesn 't make sense . You said that the ambush was arranged to frame Superman , but how could they know that he 'd show up in the ... In the middle of the desert . Thank you . The Senate hearing is expected to get underway any minute now . And of course the big unknown in all of this is will Superman show up ? That is what they 're really waiting to see . Mr. Keefe . Mr. Keefe . Soledad O 'Brien , In the Moment . Quick question for you . You 're heading in to meet with the senators . What will you tell them ? I 've come here to tell them to wake up . This is flesh and blood . He has delivered a war here . And this ... This is what war looks like . I have nothing . There are plenty of people , sir , who would say he 's their hero . He is not a hero . Grace , can you get Greg up here , please ? Right now . Senator ! Hi , you . Don 't go anywhere . I want to talk to you . You know what ? Mercy , you go in and make sure no one takes my seat . So what you been up to ? I 'm just here to tell my story . That I was willing to finance a Kryptonian deterrent , but a certain junior senator from Kentucky decided to block it . Yes , the chair of the committee on Superman is soft on security . Greg , why hasn 't he been getting our checks ? He is , Mr. Wayne . He gets a check from the Victims Fund every month . He returns them . ... who lost both his legs in those horrific events in Metropolis that happened two years ago . Jesus . Why haven 't I seen this ? I 'm sorry . I 'll get to the bottom of it . And there he is . Superman is here . He is actually at the United States Capitol . This is really a historic moment . Now we expect that Superman will give some kind of a statement to the Senate , to the American people , and , of course , to the world . He 's here . He came . - He 's above the Capitol . - Ah . You are gonna be on the hot seat in there , Junebug . I grew up on a farm . I know how to wrestle a pig . Do you know the oldest lie in America , Senator ? It 's that power can be innocent . Good luck . Oh , miss ... Rudy , she 's good to go . Get out ! - Get out ! Get out ! - Superman ! Superman ! Another one came this morning , Mr. Wayne . Let me say at the outset that I 'm grateful to our witness for coming before us today . This is how a democracy works . We talk to each other . We act by the consent of the governed , sir . I have sat here before to say that shadow interventions will not be tolerated by this committee . Neither will lies . Because today is a day for truth . Because only by speaking ... Only by working together can we ... Can we ... Can we create a free , and a ... Oh , my God ! We 're back at the nation 's Capitol , where something is happening . Capitol police are confirming to CNN that the suspected bomber is Wallace Vernon Keefe . Now these sources ... Clark , it 's me again . Can you could have gotten the explosive device into the hearing by concealing them inside his wheelchair . As for Superman , he was in the room , but obviously failed to stop him . I didn 't see it , Lo . I was standing right there and I didn 't see it . Clark , there are people behind this . I 'm afraid I didn 't see it because I wasn 't looking . All this time , I 've been living my life the way my father saw it . Righting wrongs for a ghost . Thinking I 'm here to do good . Superman was never real . Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas . That farmer 's dream is all some people have . It 's all that gives them hope . This means something . It did on my world . My world doesn 't exist anymore . Welcome . Analysis reveals ship operating at 37 % efficiency . Would you like to assume command ? Yes , I would . Yes , I would . Very well . Let 's begin . The Kryptonian archive contains knowledge from 100,000 different worlds . Good . Teach me . Alexander Luthor , your security override has been accepted . Genesis Chamber ready to analyze genetic sample . Acknowledging presence of genetic material . Analyzing . I 've identified the host as General Zod of Kandor . Acknowledging presence of foreign genetic material . Analyzing . You flew too close to the sun . Now look at you . Advising . Action forbidden . It has been decreed by the Council of Krypton that none will ever again give life to a deformity so hateful to sight and memory . The desecration without name . And where is the Council of Krypton ? Destroyed , sir . Then proceed . Very well . Preparing chrysalis and commencing metamorphosis . " And so we are left to wonder " if Superman was aware of the threat and did nothing , " was he then complicit in the Capitol tragedy ? " Still no Kent ? " His disappearance raises questions . " No . " How can he simply have disappeared " at a time when we , as a nation , need him more than ever ? " Burn him , burn him , burn him . Burn him , burn him , burn him . Something , isn 't it ? We men of Kansas live on a pancake , so we come to the mountains . All downhill from here , down to the floodplain . Farm at the bottom of the world . I remember one season the water came bad . I couldn 't have been 12 . Dad had out the shovels and we went at it all night . We worked till , I think , I fainted . But we managed to stop the water . We saved the farm . Your grandma baked me a cake . Said I was a hero . Later that day we found out we blocked the water all right . We sent it upstream . The whole Lang farm washed away . While I ate my hero cake , their horses were drowning . I used to hear them wailing in my sleep . Did the nightmares ever stop ? Yeah . When I met your mother . She gave me faith that there 's good in this world . She was my world . I miss you , son . I miss you too , Dad . You know you can 't win this . It 's suicide . I 'm older now than my father ever was . This may be the only thing I do that matters . Twenty years of fighting criminals amounts to nothing ? Criminals are like weeds , Alfred . Pull one up , another grows in its place . This is about the future of the world . This is my legacy . My father sat me down right here . Told me what Wayne Manor was built on . Railroads , real estates , and oil . The first generation made their fortune trading with the French . Pelts and skins . They were hunters . We gotta wait for more evidence , but the question still remains , where is he ? If Superman was not involved , if he 's got nothing to hide , then why hasn 't he been seen since the day of this tragedy ? You can 't ... The night is here . Excuse me . Don 't I know ... Plain Lo in the morning . Lola in slacks . Lois Lane . Mmm . Come see the view . Um ... Mmm-mmm . Now the secret to the height is the building material . It 's light metals which sway a bit in the wind . Hmm . And you know something about LexCorp metals , don 't you , Miss Lane ? I 've proven what you 've done . Wow , you 're feisty . Unfortunately , that will blow away . Like sand in the desert . You 're psychotic . That is a three-syllable word for any thought too big for little minds . Hmm . Next category : circles . Round and round and round they go to find Superman . Wrong category , boy . No , no , triangles . Yes , Euclid 's triangle inequality . The shortest distance between any two points is a straight path . And I believe the straightest path to Superman is a pretty little road ... Mmm . Called Lois Lane . You came back . You came back . Boy , do we have problems up here ! The problem of ... Of evil in the world . The problem of absolute virtue . I 'll take you in without breaking you . Which is more than you deserve . The problem of you on top of everything else . You above all . Because that 's what God is . Horus . Apollo . Jehovah . Kal-El . Clark Joseph Kent . See , what we call God depends upon our tribe , Clark-Joe . Because God is tribal . God takes sides . No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from Daddy 's fist and abominations . Mmm . I figured out way back , if God is all-powerful , he cannot be all-good . And if he is all-good , then he cannot be all-powerful . And neither can you be . They need to see the fraud you are . With their eyes . The blood on your hands . What have you done ? Hmm . And tonight , they will . Yes . Because you , my friend , have a date . Hmm . Across the bay . Ripe fruit , his hate . Two years growing . But it did not take much to push him over , actually . Little red notes , big bang . You let your family die ! And now you will fly to him . And you will battle him . To the death . Black and blue . Fight Night ! The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world . God versus man . Day versus night . Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham . You think I 'll fight him for you ? Hmm , yes , I do . I think you will fight-fight-fight for that special lady in your life . She 's safe on the ground . How about you ? Close , but I am not talking about Lois . No . Every boy 's special lady is his mother . Martha , Martha , Martha . Hmm . Why , the mother of a flying demon must be a witch . The punishment for witches , what is that ? That 's right . Death by fire . Mmm . Where is she ? I don 't know ! I would not let them tell me ! Now ... If you kill me , Martha dies . And if you fly away , mmm , Martha also dies . But if you kill the Bat ... Martha lives . There we go . There we go . Hmm . And now God bends to my will . Ooh , now the cameras are waiting at your ship . For the world to see the holes in the holy . Yes , the Almighty comes clean about how dirty he is when it counts . To save Martha , bring me the head of the Bat . Ah . Mother of God , would you look at the time ? When you came here , you had an hour . Now it 's less . CNN 's own Brooke Baldwin is on the scene . Brooke , you 're live on the air . What are you seeing ? There 's something happening at the ship . It 's sending massive power surges . Police helicopters surrounding the area . They 've created a barricade around this containment center . And we 're trying to get a little bit closer here to find out what 's going on . It is absolute chaos . You can see that lightning , those surges of electricity . They seem to be getting stronger by the minute . Daily Planet . Lois . I have to go to Gotham to convince him to help me . Who ? Or he has to die . Clark . No one stays good in this world . 2400 hours and 2 minutes . Subject declining rapidly . All procedural interventions have failed . Outcome will be death . Dr. Silas Stone suspending all clinical protocol . US Gov , object 6-19-82 is successfully activated . I need a chopper to Gotham . Call the heliport . Chopper ? We can barely afford a bicycle . You wanna chase a story ? Go to the ship . Superman 's probably there already . Perry , it 's not for a story . Jenny , get her a chopper to Gotham . And forget the heliport . Put it on the goddamn roof . On the roof , Lois ! Where are we headed ? There ! Well , here I am . Bruce . Please . I was wrong . You have to listen to me . Lex wants us to ... You don 't understand . There 's no time ! I understand . Stay down ! If I wanted it , you 'd be dead already . Breathe it in . That 's fear . You 're not brave . Men are brave . I bet your parents taught you that you mean something . That you 're here for a reason . My parents taught me a different lesson dying in the gutter for no reason at all . They taught me the world only makes sense if you force it to . You were never a God . You were never even a man . You 're letting him kill Martha . What does that mean ? Why did you say that name ? Find him . Save Martha . Martha . Martha . Why did you say that name ? Martha ! Why did you say that name ? Clark ! Stop ! Please ! Stop ! Why did you say that name ? It 's his mother 's name . It 's his mother 's name . We 're not getting any answers . We 're still right outside the containment center . A dangerous situation . Military and police personnel surrounding the area . Luthor . He wanted your life for hers . She 's losing time . The scout ship seems to be drawing power from the city . It 's got to be Lex . They need you at that ship . I 'll find her . - My mother needs me . - Wait . I 'll make you a promise . Martha won 't die tonight . Master Wayne . Alfred . Uh , I 'm sorry for listening in , but I 've tracked the Russian 's phone to a warehouse near the port . You 're locked onto it . I 'm afraid this is goodbye . And every time we say goodbye , you die a little . - Take it down . - Go ! Go ! You have to take it , Alfred . Ah , right . Commencing drone mode . Thermal imaging is showing me two dozen hostiles on the third floor . Why don 't I drop you off on the second ? Drop it . I said drop it ! I 'll kill her . Believe me , I 'll do it . I believe you . It 's okay . I 'm a friend of your son 's . I figured . The cape . " Late , late , " says the White Rabbit . Thirty seconds to animation . Right , wabbit ? Hmm . Out of tricks , out of time . And one Bat head short . Twenty seconds to animation . Ah . That 'll be the cook . Excuse me . Uh , Gotham Roast . Well done . Hello . Break the bad news . I 'd rather do the breaking in person . Ten seconds to animation . - You 've lost . - Nine . Eight . I cannot let you win . I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it , but he was not strong enough . So , if man won 't kill God two , one . ... the devil will do it ! - We 've got to get out of here ! - Perry ! All right . Stay calm , everybody ! We 're getting reports there are total blackouts in the north and to the northwest of the city . Federal authorities are trying to determine if this is part of a larger terrorist attack . Ancient Kryptonian deformity . Blood of my blood . Born to destroy you . Your Doomsday . Now God is good as dead . Oh ! POTUS joining . Mr. President . What the hell is it , Calvin ? These are live images from the top of the LexCorp tower in downtown Metropolis . Military aircraft are on the scene . This thing emerged from the Kryptonian crash site just moments ago . Thankfully though , the work day is over in the downtown core . It 's nearly empty . Now military aircraft . Those are Apache helicopters . They have now just arrived . The images that ... We 've , uh ... We just lost connection with Metropolis 8 News . Now , it 's not clear what just happened . What 's happening there , Alfred ? How best to describe it ? Metropolis airspace has been closed briefly . Excuse me ? We kindly ask that you stay in your seats . Excuse me ? Miss Prince ? Sir . Look , they 've cleared the city . Looks like he 's taking it into space . We can go straight to Key Red , Mr. President . Not yet . Are you crazy ? They 're high enough that we can nuke ' em with no casualties , sir . One casualty , Mr. President . Superman . God have mercy on us all . - Key is hot . - Key is hot . Red birds are armed to deploy , sir . Fire at will . Three , two , one ... Oh , God . Projectile 1 . Impact . Stryker 's Island , east of Metropolis . That 's uninhabited . Projectile 2 ... No apparent reentry . Projectile 2 ? Superman , Mr. President . Projectile 2 was Superman . Sir . It 's moving . The shockwaves are getting stronger . Every time we hit it , we make it more powerful . We can 't attack . What are you saying , Calvin ? I 'm saying it 's unkillable . Master Wayne , are you receiving me ? Alfred . It 's Kryptonian . Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it . They might . If you had any left . I got one round left . The spear . Alfred , the spear . It 's pure Kryptonite . It 's back in Gotham . If I can penetrate the skin , the spear will kill it . It would in theory . I 've gotta get it to chase me back to the city . Back to the Kryptonite . Oh , shit . Why did you bring him back to the city ? The port is abandoned . There 's a weapon here that can kill it . Did you find the spear ? I 've been a little busy . This thing , this creature , seems to feed on energy . This thing is from another world . My world . I 've killed things from other worlds before . Is she with you ? I thought she was with you . Clark ! Clark ! Clark ! Clark ! Clark ! Are you all right ? I love you . No . No , Clark , you can 't . This is my world . No , Clark , don 't . You are my world . No . Please . Clark ! Hi . Clark had this sent here , so he could surprise you . All those circuses back east burying an empty box . They don 't know how to honor him , except as a soldier . I 've failed him in life . I won 't fail him in death . Help me find the others like you . Perhaps they don 't want to be found . They will . And they 'll fight . We have to stand together . A hundred years ago , I walked away from mankind . From a century of horrors . Man made a world where standing together is impossible . Men are still good . We fight . We kill . We betray one another . But we can rebuild . We can do better . We will . We have to . The others like me . Why did you say they 'll have to fight ? Just a feeling . Turn around and face the wall . Place your forehead against the wall . Put your hands behind your back , so that I can come in and restrain you . Whatever you do , wherever you go , I 'll be watching you . But the bell 's already been rung . And they 've heard it . Out in the dark . Among the stars . Hmm . Ding dong , the God is dead . But a bell cannot be unrung ! He 's hungry . He 's found us . And he 's coming ! Ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding . Ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding . Ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding . Ding , ding , ding , ding , ding . Ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding . Ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding .

 ( announcer ) Previously on " Hunters " ... Why did McCarthy single out the new agent ? ( grunts ) - He has the scar . - ( screaming ) Losing you was the worst thing that ever happened to me . I know what you are . Emme , I 'm still the same person . ( clicking ) You 're not a person . You 're launching a nuclear attack on us . ( Abby ) We 're not planning an attack . We 're trying to leave earth . I 'll tell you where the launch is . In exchange , I get immunity . ( Finnerman ) This is a kill mission . ( sonic blast ) All Hunters are to be shot on sight . We drove straight from the hotel , got here as fast as we could . He should be healing , I don 't understand . There are traitors everywhere . ( Jackson ) Regan is inside . Agent Regan can 't be trusted . She 's my agent , not yours . ( sonic blast ) You are no longer in command here . ( sonic boom ) ( Briggs ) How 'd you know ? ( Jackson ) I suspected Finnerman when the bomb went off . I knew for certain the minute she sent me here . ( Finnerman ) Briggs betrayed me .

Are you all right ? I 'm alive , at least . We have McCarthy . McCarthy ? He came to us . Says he 'll tell you where the launch is , but only if he gets immunity . Do you believe him ? I don 't think we have a choice . He says the launch is in 48 hours . - All right , bring him in . - To ETU ? - What about Finnerman ? - Don 't worry about Finnerman . She tried to have me killed . Flynn went AWOL with me . - It 's safe , I 'll explain ... - What ? No ! I 'll explain later when you get here . What 's wrong ? Are you all right ? It 's been a long night . Just bring McCarthy in . We need to stop this launch . Mankind dreams of leaving their home planet . They build machines to take them . They know not how these ambitions will end . How many Hunters have arrived ? Lots of families . Children . They 're gathered in the hangar . Liana 's sending out a message to any stragglers using the old system . We purge in two days . I must go to them . Musa , no . It 's not good for them to see you in this condition . I 'll only worry them . You need to take your medication . Enough . Get that away from me . I should be healed by now . They are amongst us . Who are ? The Exalted , the traitors . I killed as many as I could find . But some must have survived . You killed other Hunters ? They must be stopped before this retched flesh takes me . You need to rest , Musa . They are ... inside . I must regain my strength . ( clicking ) ( clicks ) Take me to my Feelers . I am weak . I must feed . ( clicking ) ( guttural growls ) ( grunts ) ( both shriek ) ( clicking ) ♪ ♪ ♪ I 'm calling for you ♪ ♪ You are why I 'm still breathing ♪ The prodigal Hunter returns . Truss , long time no see . You 're looking ... not so good . Upstairs , training room . Lionel came to us , he is our guest . We will treat him with respect . I 'm sorry about what happened in the hotel . I tried to stop it . So you squared it with Finnerman ? There is something you ought to see . No shit . It wasn 't us . I know . Hunters got to her . Local P.D. found the body dumped a few miles from here an hour ago . They used the syringe , tissue extraction . It 's a warning . They can get to any of us any time . She deserved it . Flynn , I want you to talk to McCarthy , get negotiations started . Yes , sir . Gladly . Nobody deserves this . She wanted to genocide an entire species . You gonna defend her now ? You disobeyed a direct order when you helped that Hunter family escape . They were innocent . There are gonna have to be some changes around here if I 'm gonna let you back on the team . You don 't get preferential treatment anymore . Preferential treatment ? Are you serious ? Briggs treats me like a leper and Flynn only likes me because I saved his life . I mean from me . You 're a soldier , Regan . You do as I say when I say it , otherwise , I can no longer consider you one of us . Human , you mean . Do we understand one another ? Yes , sir . ( Flynn ) Here 's the deal . If what you say is true , we need answers and we need them now . We 're offering protective custody . A security detail . Your movement will be restricted , but you 'll be comfortable . Hunters have our own ways of making a pact . Get me a dagger , the blood of six rabbits , and a gyroscope . ( chuckling ) We don 't need papers , Flynn , old boy . Come on , man ! Seriously ? After everything we 've been through together ? I trust you . Then tell me where the launch location is . I 'm not just gonna tell you where it is . I mean , where 's the fun in that ? I knew it . I know you 're playing games with us . I 'll take you to it . Field trip . All right . But if you try anything , I 'll kill you myself . Old dog , old tricks . You don 't have it in you anymore . Don 't make me prove it . We 're already tapped into Prism , call-mining for clicks . They can 't hide an entire launch site . Then we search quadrant by quadrant until we find them . Thought we were rid of you , Guano . ( cries out ) Get out of my face , or you will end up like Finnerman . Finnerman ? You haven 't heard ? Hunters bagged your cougar . Body 's in the lab . Where 's this supposed spaceship supposedly going ? Why , to Saturn , of course . Where the Hunter colony ship lies in high orbit . The colony 's ship will take everyone back to the Hunter home planet and so ends Hunter-human relations . Except with me , of course . If this checks out , McCarthy , you got yourself a deal . There 's just one small detail . Conventional human technology is too slow and inefficient to travel to Saturn quickly enough , so the ship that Musa built ... it 's like your project Orion . Go on . Papa will explain . Jackson ! I need to call the Defense Secretary and warn him now . Jackson ! What 's going on ? Project Orion was a spaceflight program from the 1950s . The technology called for an ... The technology called for nuclear energy to be used to launch a space ship . Like nuclear subs ? No . A nuclear explosion launches the ship . Not just one nuke , dozens of them , one right after the other . The fallout ... Will cover an area far greater than the airspace cleared by Bob Brecke . It will cover the entire continent . What are you doing ? I 'm pulling you out of school . - You 're not serious . - I am . Close the door . You 're gonna stay with your Aunt Josie in Canada . What ? No ! She 's like 19 and she lives in the North Pole . She 's 26 . She lives in Saskatchewan and it 's just for a few days . Maybe longer . It doesn 't matter , I 'm not going . What is this all about ? It 's too dangerous to stay here anymore . - I need you far away . - From what ? Is it those scary guys at your work ? Flynn , I promise , I didn 't tell anyone about Abby . I know . And that 's not what this is about . Emme , you 're leaving . This is not up for debate . Then you 're gonna have to drag me out . ( Emme ) Abby 's gone . I 'm not leaving you , too . Emme ... I can 't do this anymore . I can 't pretend to be your dad anymore . You 're better off with a real family . But I love you . I love you , too . ( Jackson ) We are less than 36 hours away from a nuclear disaster . Yes , we have confirmation on the intel . Our informant says the launch site is in northern Mexico . A Hunter sleeper agent disabled satellite response for that region . I 've briefed my team , we 're deploying immediately . Roger that , yes , sir , we will . What is it ? McCarthy 's playing you . I know that . But he 's the lesser of two evils , so we 're playing along . Even if he 's leading us into a trap ? You have a problem following my orders ? Dr. James thinks that Finnerman might have already been dead when the Hunters took a tissue sample . All the other victims were still alive during the extraction . So it 's a pity that we can 't ask Finnerman what really happened . You had me call her to the farmhouse and now she 's dead . Yeah , well , Ruth made a lot of enemies . But only one took her out . We 're moving out in 30 . Be ready . Dismissed . So why are you ratting out on Musa now ? He 's leaving . It 's now or never . Then why bother ? I did Musa 's dirty work , you know ? Killed and terrorized while he Elon Musk 'd it and played philosopher king . Revenge . How primitive . Yes . We understand each other . Not even close . Oh , but we do . Musa abandoned me . Liana abandoned you . Musa abandoned your father . Circle of strife . Come on . You 're Simba and Mommy is big bad Scar . Hakuna fu ... matata ! ( laughing ) Ooh . Hello , kitten . Grr . Feisty . Why don 't you just go back to your home planet and save us all a lot of grief ? To be honest with you , I kinda like it here . You know what I 'm talking about , Agent Alison Regan . Oh , look who 's here . Ha ! It 's the same with Abby . I tried for years to get her out from her cover , your sham of a marriage . But she kept making excuses to stay . Star-crossed lovers . Literally . ( chuckling ) All she really wants is to be with you . Soon , we shall leave this cursed planet , Liana . All our hard work finally coming to fruition . But I 'm worried about you . Your health . Abby said she took you to the Feelers to feed , but you still look unwell . Do you need another injection ? Perhaps I look unwell because I feel under threat . Am I under threat ? The humans have proved more resilient than we thought . No threats from within ? They 're all devoted , Brother Number Four . ( choking ) And you ? Who are you devoted to ? ( straining ) My own kind . ( shrieks ) ( clicking ) ( shrieks ) Musa ? Liana ? ( clicking ) Get away from him ! - ( growls ) - Abby , no ! He is no danger ! ( snarls ) Liana is trying to kill me . What ? No , that isn 't true . She 's been taking care of you . I thought so , too . But look at my body . It is getting worse . The medicine she gave me . Poison . No , that can 't be . You 're not well , Brother . She murdered one of my loyal feelers . Why would she do that ? She is Exalted . We must stop her . ( radio chatter ) ( Flynn ) Finnerman was right about the Hunters , all that talk about innocence . A whole lot of nothing . Bullshit . So , everything okay with you and Regan ? That 's none of your business . She was pretty rattled that Finnerman turned on her . Can 't blame her . Quite the betrayal . We 've all had our share . Abby was telling the truth about the Purge . Apparently . But she didn 't say shit about the launch frying millions of humans . McCarthy said the only Hunters who knew were Musa and Liana . Inner circle . Yeah , well , McCarthy 's not exactly forthcoming . If Abby knew or not , doesn 't change the mission . So you are prepared to stop her if it comes to that . I wouldn 't be sitting here if I wasn 't sir . You get Emme to someplace safe ? Safe enough . ( McCarthy ) You look excited . To see your mom again . Thrilled . Your mom 's strong . Decisive . You should look up to her . Young women need positive role models . My mom is weak . Musa 's pawn . That 's where you 're wrong . Everything Liana 's done has been for the good of her kind . Of our kind . You 're not one of them , and you never will be . But , of course , you already knew that . ( clicking ) Knock that lizard shit off , or I 'm putting your gag on . We 're here . ( Briggs ) He 's screwing with us . Give him a minute . ( Flynn ) We don 't have a minute . That way . Carroll , check it out . ( McCarthy ) Safe for now . Hunters only fly at night . Regan . Put the restraints back on it . Restraints ? I gotta do restraints ? If McCarthy 's lying to us , we should take him out for good . Hell , even if he 's telling the truth , we should take him out . I heard that . Bat-eared freak . Not very nice . I made a deal . McCarthy keeps his end up , I 'll keep up mine . He 's a risk . The longer he remains alive , the more we 're all in danger . The decision 's been made . Oh , shit . ( Jackson ) Carroll , what do you see ? - The ship . - Do a head count , get back here . Roger that . And you doubted me . Oh , ye of little faith . I 'm a man of my word , just like you are , Elder Jackson . Why did you come to me with this information ? Why me ? I 've spent over 30 years studying humans , the good , the bad , the ugly . I 've seen ' em all . The difference between your kind and ours is that humans aspire to something beyond primal hungers . In that regard , you 're the humanest human I 've ever met . No . I am hardly perfect . Of course not . You 're a sinner , just like I am . This is our redemption , Truss . Musa 's blood spills and together , we save mankind . Or at least a few million Mexicans . Thank you . De nada . We may need more intel . Keep Mr. McCarthy in the vehicle until after the raid is over . Stay gold , Ponyboy . ( man ) Ground to control . Cargo is currently being loaded . ( woman ) Copy , ground . Pre-flight alignment complete . Launch window has been determined . 14 hours and counting . ( man ) Copy , control . 14 hours and counting . All right , listen up . The Mexican government is preparing an evacuation plan for the surrounding area . We strike , once civilian contingencies are in place approximately 0300 now . Our two auxiliary units will be providing backup support . Once that emergency signal goes out , we 'll have to move fast . If the Hunters get word , they 'll know we 're coming . So Carroll , Regan , you 'll take team one into the main compound , draw as many Hunters as possible away from the ship . Briggs , you will wait for them to confirm the path is clear then take team two to the ship , disable the launch . Potassium iodide . This will give you some protection from the radiation . God willing , we won 't need it . You , ethnic sidekick with an attitude . You got a snappy comment or you here just to look cute ? You think you 're so smart ? ( chuckling ) You know what I call you ? Takeout . You 're not going anywhere . I got what I wanted . Musa and his followers captured by the humans and me into the wind before you fools even ... ( sonic burst ) ( clicking ) ( weakly clicking ) ( woman speaking Spanish over radio ) Regan . The evacuation is underway . Where are we with the breach ? ( Regan ) We 're approaching the hangars . There 's guards posted at the perimeter . ( man ) Sir , McCarthy 's down . Down ? Down how ? Sonic blast . Briggs was the last one with him . It had to be done . You disobeyed a direct order . The order was bullshit . Someone around here needs to start doing the right thing , putting these freaks down like the monsters they are . And if you don 't have the balls for that , I 'm happy to handle it . You 're way out of line . No , I know what you did to Finnerman . You want me to keep my mouth shut . So from now on , in this unit , I make my own decisions . You can 't prove who killed Finnerman . I don 't have to . And if you come after me , I 'll bury you first . We got a launch to stop , sir . McCarthy was shot on my command . Clean it up . ( man ) Yes , sir , right away , Deploy your team , Agent . Whatever you say , Commander . ( woman ) Auto launch sequence initiated . ( man ) T-minus 15 minutes to fuel cell ignition . ( clicking ) ( clicking ) ( man ) Hello ? Everyone 's boarded the ship . ( clicking ) What are you doing out here ? ( sonic blast ) ( sonic blast ) ( Flynn ) Jackson , we 're inside the hangars , dividing up the search . ( creatures shrieking ) Hold up . You 're bleeding . Are you okay ? Our security 's being breached . We 're being raided . Move that truck now ! Make sure all the travelers are out of the hangar and inside the ship . Then bring Musa to join them . When you did the head count , did you see my mom ? Abby , too . You heard Jackson 's orders . Clear Brigg 's path to the ship . Disable the warheads . Kill anyone who gets in the way . ( sonic blasts ) Watch yourself . ( man ) T-minus 13 minutes to fuel cell ignition . What are you doing ? You 're a traitor . You tried to kill Musa . Musa betrayed us first . You 're Exalted . The enemy . We are the true Hunters . This flesh is not an accident . It is what was always intended . He 's our brother and you tried to kill him . Musa kept the truth from you , but you remain his loyal soldier . Your experience with the humans is irreplaceable . You understand love , how to use it against them ? ( man ) T-minus 12 minutes to fuel cell ignition . I won 't help you . Never . You 're pathetic . You think the humans want you ? That Carroll loves you ? You were a warrior once ! I still am . ( Briggs ) Carroll , we 're almost there . Copy that , hangars are clear . ( creature clicking ) Wait , I hear something . ( man ) T-minus 11 minutes to fuel cell ignition . ( Musa ) Flynn Carroll . You have come . I knew you would . Uh-uh . You keep that thing back . ( clicking ) I won 't let it hurt you . ( Flynn ) Jackson , I found Musa . Copy that . Detain him if you can . I only want to go to my ship . You can protect me . One more move , I 'll shoot . Your weapons don 't work on me . Bullshit . You 're just like the rest of them . I am not and neither are you . You are not like the other humans . No one on earth has ever survived the Great Hunt . Except for you . It is the sign . You are the one who can stop my enemies . They are here . Hunters . The ones who went astray . ( alarm sounding ) Musa , where are you ? ( clicking ) ( man ) T-minus ten minutes to fuel cell ignition . ( Liana clicking ) ( clicking ) ( clicks ) ( clicking ) - ( sonic blasts ) - ( cries out ) ( man ) T-minus nine minutes to fuel cell ignition . ( sonic blasts ) ( Briggs ) Jackson , the Hunters have all boarded the ship . We 're heading for the control room . What do your enemies want ? Everything . They will devour your planet like locusts , but we can stop them . It is your fate . I sent an angel from above to watch over you . Abby . Yes . So you can save my kind . You 've been shitting on my life for the past six years , bombing , killing . It had to be done . So does this . ( growls ) We ... are ... going home ! ( straining ) ( sonic blasts ) ( shrieks ) ( straining ) ( shouts ) ( shrieks ) ( cries out ) ( sonic blasts ) ( man ) T-minus eight minutes to fuel cell ignition . ( Briggs ) Jackson , we 've reached the control room . The launch has been disabled , but we 've got a bigger problem . The ship 's grounded , but the nukes are still set to blow . The sequence for detonation has already started . ( motors whirring ) I can hear the module mechanics . It 's already underway . We 've got seven minutes until boom town . They 'll go off on the ground , not in the air . Smaller radius . Two kilotons is still gonna leave a hell of a crater . We need to get out of here . And the Hunters ? Fail alarms are going off . The Hunters inside are trapped and they know it . They 'll all die in there . Get ' em out . Doors are sealed shut , we stop to break ' em out and we 're not gonna make it . ( man ) T-minus seven minutes to fuel cell ignition . Abandon the mission . Evacuate now . We can 't outrun the fallout . No , but we can survive it . Gear up and get your team out as quickly as you can . My arm , it 's burning ! It 's okay . It 's gonna be okay . ( Jackson ) Carroll , Regan ? The launch has been sabotaged , but the nukes are still set to blow . Get everyone you can out of there right now . We gotta move . The Hunters are still on board . They 're all gonna die . - Abby , there 's no time ! - Please , we need to save them . Hold up , Briggs ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Oh , son of a bitch . ( man ) T-minus six minutes to fuel cell ignition . ( clicking ) It 's okay , I 'm here ! ( straining ) ( sonic blasts ) Abby ! Come on , we gotta go ! Come on ! - They 're all gonna die ! - Yeah . Come on , it 's too late ! We 'll die trying to save them ! - Come on ! - Then I die ! - Abby ! - We can 't just leave them ! Hey . Hands up . Step away from the truck . Mom . There you are . You found me . Musa sabotaged the launch . I tried to stop him , but he was too strong . ( Jackson ) Regan , are you still in the compound ? Why would Musa do that ? He gathered us all together to destroy us . He wasn 't our Moses , he was a monster . ( Jackson ) Regan , do you copy ? I have a plane a few miles away and this truck will protect us from the blast . Evacuate now , that 's an order ! The humans have no respect for you . You 're just a skin puppet to them . I can save you . Save us . We die here or we live together . ( man ) T-minus five minutes to fuel cell ignition . Regan , please , if you can hear me , have you found a vehicle ? Are you headed to safety ? Carroll ! Carroll , do you read me ? Copy ! And Regan , any word ? Nothing .

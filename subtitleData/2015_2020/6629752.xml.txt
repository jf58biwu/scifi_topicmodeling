 Coulson : Previously on Marvel 's " Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... - We got him . - Hive . He has to be destroyed . Fitz : Hive could create a virus that transforms any humans - into swayed Inhumans . - If he finds a way to disperse it high enough in the atmosphere . He could infect a significant percentage of the human race . Daisy : I told him everything , including the plans to the Zephyr . Mack : And the fact that it has high-altitude capabilities . Hive has his delivery system now . - I want to find Hive . - Coulson : And get revenge ? This isn 't about revenge . - Hey . - You 're in pain . 3x22 - Ascension Please ... [ Breathing shakily ] ... take me back . Interesting . Your name . Something ... pretty . Not pretty like the sky . A flower . - Daisy . - Please . [ Panting ] What ? What is it ? - I can 't . - What ? Why not ? What did S.H.I.E.L.D. do to you ? It 's not what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to me . It 's what that creature stole from you . - He made you ... impervious . - Please . Just ... [ Breathes shakily ] No . I 'm sorry , Daisy . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Music ] [ Rumbling ] [ Screaming ] [ Whirring ] Once the hangar doors are open , his monster patrol will storm the base . - Any idea how many Hive has infected ? - Everyone in Quadrant D , along with agents O 'Brien and Marshall . - That 's something like 20 agents ? - It 's 28 . [ Rumbling ] Was that Daisy ? Perhaps this was always meant ... [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] No more talking , then . [ Alarm blaring ] - Daisy 's in trouble . - Sir , there 's been a malfunction in Daisy 's containment module . You check the feed from the plane ? Yeah , it 's gone dark after the earthquake . So either the Primitives found their way down to her or ... She found a way up . - No . - Coulson : Take a look . - Report back ASAP . - Fitz . [ Blaring continues ] What the hell are your Primitives capable of ? Well , it 's hard to say , really . I mean , these creatures are in their infancy . - You did create them , didn 't you ? - It was either that or be eaten . I never would 've created something so unsophisticated . I mean , the crudeness of these creatures is really quite ... heartbreaking . We 'll discuss the consequences of your science fair later . Right now , we need to know exactly what we 're up against . The Primitives possess adrenaline-induced peak-human strength but rather poor eyesight . They 're connected to Hive in the same way that Daisy was , but they don 't exhibit any original thoughts of their own . They have memories ? They possess memories of previous talents ... weapon skills and the like . We have 28 ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that know this base inside out . How long before they find their way through the hangar doors ? Several hours at least . [ Metallic thudding ] They may not have to . - They 're in the vents . - Lock down the armory . Simmons , secure what you can in the lab and then rendezvous in my office . Lincoln and I will protect the nerve center . [ Scoffs ] So I 'll just stay here ? - Daisy took the module into the plane . - To stop Hive . You think that she can do it ? Get us some rope in case she can 't . [ Rumbling ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunting , panting ] You know killing me won 't make the pain go away . Or will it ? I can 't remember . I don 't want you to die . I want you to suffer . [ Grunts ] Seems you 're the one who 's suffering . [ Grunts ] I 'm sorry you won 't feel our connection pieces solving a puzzle . [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] [ Knife clatters ] [ Rumbling ] [ Bones breaking ] But we must continue without you . [ Grunting ] Bones don 't hold me up . I 'm held up by all the parts working as one . Glad we found you , boss . We got communication coordinates from S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . How did we manage to ... Right . That 's how . Absolution . I 'll load the warhead in . So , she , uh , back on the team ? I believe her presence guarantees they won 't try to blow us out of the sky before we reach altitude . What about the rest of these friendly faces ? All but a few will stay behind to destroy the last of S.H.I.E.L.D. [ Footsteps approaching ] When in doubt , follow the leader . Then try to keep up . The armory 's up ahead . I 'll secure the weapons rack while ... No , no ... No . No . Yo-Yo , what 'd you do ? What 'd you do ? [ Electricity powers down ] [ Tool clicking ] - I can fly this . - You have experience with this thing ? It looks a little sophisticated . Between Will Daniels and Grant Ward , I have enough . [ Sighs ] - Help me get her into the workshop . - They 're right behind us . [ Primitives snarling ] Close the door ! Close the door ! [ Grunts ] - What the hell happened ? - The Primitives got to the armory first . Yo-Yo took a bullet in the gut for me . Sir , where 's everyone else ? [ Panting ] [ Door rattling ] [ Engines humming ] [ Music ] [ Engines roaring ] Did we just stop midair ? I 've transitioned the aircraft into vertical flight . We 're ascending . Straight up to 100,000 feet . Calculations are , uh , helping me collect my thoughts . We 'll set the timer to blow the warhead at the optimal elevation ... Dispersing the formula into the stratosphere . And by dawn , it will descend onto most of Europe . Hang on . Hang on . We 're still riding this bloody space elevator . How are we supposed to connect to all our new brothers and sisters if we 're blowing ourselves to bits ? We 'll drop in the containment module to safety before it detonates . Unless you want to stay behind , make sure nothing goes wrong . [ Timer beeping ] [ Objects clatter ] Look . It 's really bad . She 's bleeding out . I can 't see . Hey , " Electric Company , " can you light things up ? Coulson : I got it . [ Light clicks ] Radcliffe : Oh , that 's not good . She 's bleeding way too fast . Her metabolism must 've increased - to compensate for her Inhuman speed . - Can you fix it ? If we can get her an injection of Acebutolol from the lab . We can 't get to the lab 'cause this idiot turned good agents into kill zombies , so come up with something else . I 'd been kidnapped , repeatedly threatened . Yeah , well , Daisy said you were more than happy to play mad scientist . - I need tools , medicine . - Well , the alternative was death . Stop ! We can either argue or we can save her ... not both . We 're trapped in this room , so we need to stop the bleeding with something in here . [ Door thudding ] You can 't get away . I didn 't say it was a good idea , but it may be our best . - It could kill her . - We can do better . Not in the time we have . Hold this . [ Blowtorch clicks ] No . Mack . [ Labored breathing ] [ Screams ] [ Primitive grunts ] [ Screaming in distance ] [ Primitives grunt ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Breathes shakily ] [ Breathing heavily ] The heat . [ Grunts ] [ Door rattling ] Coulson : There are a lot of agents still out there . - At least Yo-Yo 's stabilized . - Hey . Don 't do that to me . Don 't take a bullet in the gut for me . I try and catch them . Too slow . This is very impressive . Is this the young Scotsman 's work ? Huh . Of course . Huh . Know if has a working model yet ? Are you serious ? Oh , this is stunning . [ Rattling stops ] Must be looking for another way in . [ Footsteps approaching ] [ Grunts ] [ May grunts ] [ Panting ] Daisy : What are you doing here ? Grabbing you , taking back the Zephyr . [ Panel beeps ] No , Fitz , don 't open that . - What ? - I should be in here . I 'm a liability . Okay , well , I think there 's some weapons in the back . Lincoln : Guys , she 's burning up . Could be a sign of infection , which means we 'll need antibiotics . No , it 's hot as hell in here . I 'm sweating like a horse . It is . I thought the power was off . Uh , the heating system 's old school . It doesn 't need electricity . What ? They crank up the heat ? Why would they do that ? Trying to flush us out ? Why else ? She 's blinding them . Simmons . Genius , you say ? She must 've figured it out . Their eyes were damaged , clouded over . I suspected they could see somehow , - but it must be ... - Infrared . Must be infrared . [ Chuckles ] Clever girl . Crank the heating up to 110 degrees Fahrenheit , and we 're free to move around as we please . So you want us to go out there on a hunch and hope those things don 't rip us apart ? It 's not a hunch . It 's science . It 's a science hunch . [ Flashlight clicks ] Doctor . [ Music ] [ Exhales slowly ] Well , we better follow him . He has no idea where he 's going . It 's like he scraped me out of my own skull . [ Box thuds ] Even when I tried killing him , he beat me . My powers are nothing compared to Hive . I don 't give a damn about your powers . They 're not what made you an agent . I did . May , you ... you have no idea what I did . - I have nothing left . - Then why did Andrew save you ? Yeah , you did a lot of bad things . All you can do now is balance the scales , do some good . You want to give up , live in a box ? Go ahead . But that hurt stays in there with you . Believe me . Listen , I may not always show it , but I ... [ grunts ] May ! [ Music ] [ Breathing shakily ] [ Music ] Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! If you kill me , you 'll die . I swear . I swear . I have a weapon in place on this plane that 's designed to kill you . So if you shoot me , I can 't tell you what that is . But you won 't see it coming . Leave him alone ! Giyera , listen to me . Look at me . - You and I have a connection , right ? - Not anymore . I swept the plane . Didn 't see anything . I 'm telling the truth , I swear . You won 't see it . [ Breathing heavily ] - Show me . - Okay . Okay . Okay , just let me put this down . Remember , we don 't want to hurt you if we don 't have to . People that are under sway ... they 're not in control of their actions . They 're not bad people . Well ... except you . You were a murderous wank before all this . [ Sighs ] [ Panting ] I did tell you . A few times . [ Gun thuds ] [ Panting ] [ Panel beeping , door slides open ] Well ? [ Breathing heavily ] [ Panel beeps ] I 'm okay . We disabled the containment module . - Hive can 't escape . - So you 're with us ? - You okay ? You 're shaking . - She 's going through withdrawals . Plus , the Zephyr can handle high altitude , but it 's not designed for it . It 's subfreezing outside , - which also means ... - The air 's getting thin in here . So we should limit our movements and try and keep warm . - So , what do we do next ? - This is as far as we got . I sealed off the stairs . Not sure how long it 'll hold , but , hey . [ Lamp clatters ] - Oh . Thank God . - Thank God you missed . - [ Groans ] Is she okay ? - She 's stable for now . - Have you seen the others ? - I checked the containment room . By the looks of it , Fitz and May climbed up into the Zephyr . Then there 's hope they 'll stop them . Or be blown to bits . Did you notice the heat ? - I increased the temperature because ... - We figured it out , yeah . Yeah , I did . Picked up on it straight away . We make a pretty good team here at the Strategic Homeland ... - What comes after " Homeland " ? - Just say S.H.I.E.L.D. [ Grunts ] Are you all right ? - What happened ? - Mack lit me on fire . It 's a long story . - She needs a hospital . - There 's no way out . Took me a while to open the lock-down window , but it 's a 40-foot drop . - What about the underground tunnels ? - Sealed shut . - I have a way . - Hey . Who came up with ... Fitz was inspired by your work , put a few new tricks up my sleeve . [ Arm beeping ] - Remote Quinjet ? - Hell yeah . It 's on its way , but let 's be clear . I 'll get you to medical , to safety , we 'll contact Talbot , have him authorize military force to take back our base , but then I take the Quinjet to intercept the Zephyr ... on my own . Sir , I have to get to Fitz . You 're not doing this by yourself . - You can 't expect us to just ... - It 's not up for discussion . You 're agents , I 'm the director . I brought Hive to this planet . It 's on me to stop it . - If May were here ... - She 'd give me a very dirty look , yeah . I 'll get them out , get them home , but I 'm not gonna lose anyone else . [ Engines roaring ] I have to say , I really enjoy the way you do things . [ Sighs ] [ Window shatters ] [ Music ] [ Monitor beeping ] I 'm starting to think clearly . Adjusting for wind speed . Setting the last of the coordinates now . So , uh , when we blow this thing , three continents ' worth of people are gonna end up looking like these buggers , yeah ? Even the ladies ? Look , I don 't want to seem ungrateful . I 'm pumped to be changing the world and all that , but down the road , can we still look at tweaking the formula ? I 've had some not so " Golden Girls " in my time . You know , I had too much booze in the mix . I 'm just trying to manage expectations moving forward . It 's done . Let 's tell Giyera to prepare the containment module . What is this ? Stowaways . Tenacious little rat bags , aren 't they ? Find them . [ Clanking ] [ Sighs ] [ Music ] [ Thud ] - The Quinjet ... it 's here . - Yeah , the Quinjets fly themselves . Director Coulson must 've called one to him . May : They 're ducks in a barrel until they deplane , though . We need to get to the docking station . Fitz : Let 's just hope whoever 's on the Quinjet has an idea about what happens next . I know exactly what happens next . [ Music ] [ Hissing ] You came alone . I gave the order for the others to stay behind . I don 't need anymore agents dying for my lapses in judgment . - So you acknowledge that you 'll die . - I 'm prepared to . If you plan on blowing this plane up with both of us onboard , it won 't end this . Millions will still be turned . Yeah , they won 't be handsome , but at least they won 't be swayed and stuck with your winning personality . - I 'll end you first . - And sense of humor . Look , I 'll do whatever it takes . I crossed a line with you ... a line I vowed never to cross . I hunted you down and killed you , unleashing this Ward reboot nightmare hell beast on the planet . You give yourself too much credit . Every Inhuman has a purpose . - My fate is to do what I 'm doing ... - Yeah , yeah . ... to crusade for all Inhumans . - Your real mistake was opposing us . - It 's ironic . I actually set out to protect Inhumans . In fact , lost friends over it . Even good old Agent Blake said my policy on the matter made him sick . - You 're hiding something . - A few stowaways , yeah . Probably already made their presence felt . I 'm just here to offer a helping hand . Pun absolutely intended . Or have you given me exactly what I need to finally defeat them ? - Your body . - Oh . I 'll shed this host and take you and march down to announce to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that I finally succeeded in defeating the great Alveus . The day is won . No need to remain concealed in the shadows . Yeah . You sound just like me . Oh , I will ... once I 'm in that head of yours . I can 't wait . We 're two sides of the same coin , Coulson ... commanders leading soldiers . The only difference is , when you give an order , you followers have no choice but to obey . But when I gave my team the order to stay behind , they just wouldn 't listen . They got out right before docking was complete ... climbed along the top of the fuselage to a maintenance hatch . I 'm just a distraction . [ Grunts ] I said I was willing to die , sure , but I certainly don 't want to . I picked up this little move from my misguided buddy Blake . Figured I could get an egomaniac who 'd been alone for 1,000 years to chat . Plus , I always wanted to do this . Help me , Obi-Wan Kenobi . You 're my only ... [ Grunts ] He 'll be coming soon . Let 's go . [ Music ] We need to get to the cargo bay . [ Electricity zaps ] Lincoln ! [ grunts ] - I 'll get him ... - To over get this wound . - Aah ! - Lincoln ! - [ Panting ] Is he okay ? - Lincoln ! Stay with us . Tell me he 's gonna be okay . Yes , yeah , he 'll live , um , if there 's no internal hemorrhage . Siloxane . - Sorry , sorry . - Aah . Okay . Stay with me , hey ? Yeah . You 're okay . You 're okay . Hey , look at me . You should be fine . But you need to remain as still as possible until we can get to ground , properly dress it , okay ? Daisy : I 'm sorry , Lincoln . I 'm sorry . I never meant to turn against you . - I never ... - I know . I don 't blame you . You weren 't yourself . [ Sniffles ] I am now . You never came to see me in my cell . I knew what you were going through and that you needed time [ Breathing heavily ] to put yourself back together . D-Did I ruin this ? Us ? I just think ... we need to work on ourselves before we can talk about us . [ Sniffles ] Yeah . [ Sighs ] [ Crying ] The stuff that I did , Lincoln , [ Music ] - I can 't live with it . - I remember that pain ... sick with guilt , anger . I know why you went to face Hive alone . I tried . I tried to defeat him . - I did , but I ... - Daisy . Daisy . I know why you went to him . Like I said , I 've been through it . I 've hit bottom . I know what it 's like to be so addicted to something that you 'd do anything to get her back . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Clanking ] Hive and his worker bees will be down here any second . - And then ? - Even if we could steal the warhead , it 's probably on a timer by now , timed with their ascent . I don 't suppose you came with any concrete ideas . I have one . Coulson 's gonna need your help . I don 't know what he 's planning , but ... - I do . - What are you ... [ Sighs ] He ... He had the Quinjets fly here remotely , right ? - So he probably ... - Set new coordinates for outer space . The Quinjet will disconnect from the Zephyr and then fly straight up until it leaves the atmosphere . If we can steal the warhead and load it onto the Quinjet somehow , - it 'll blow in the ... - Vacuum of space , and the pathogen will disperse harmlessly ... Solving at least that part of the problem . What are you ... That 's ... Where did you get that ? [ Music ] - Daisy ? What are you ... - I 'm accepting fate . No . Don 't try to do this yourself . Hive will come down here looking for us . If the others can keep him occupied , I 'll be able ... No , I remember what you said about your vision . Someone will be in that Quinjet with the warhead . - Only if I have to . - Do not go in there . That thing will fly itself if nobody touches the controls . I know . I know . I ... I know what you 're thinking . You said you can 't live with what you 've done , but you have to . Okay ? Promise me you won 't ... you won 't try to ... atone for your sins with some kind of sacrifice . Now all we have to do is decide who goes and who stays to hold off a wave of Primates and Hive the Terrible . Well , I 'd like to be in a fight . Built this damn thing for a reason . - Where 's Daisy ? - I couldn 't stop her . [ Grunting ] [ Music ] Coulson : He 's here ! It 's time to finish these guys off ! - Coulson : No . - He went for Daisy ! [ Whirring ] [ Grunts ] [ Music ] Hive : Well , isn 't this poetic ? Feels like it was meant to be . You 're easy to find . I smelled your blood . - Led me right here . - Every Inhuman has a purpose . Lash saved me so I could end this . S.H.I.E.L.D. has you fighting their wars again . We plan to end wars , remember ? - Bring peace . - You mean absolute power . Well , not today . The autopilot coordinates have been set . This thing is going to outer space ... with you in it . Ward is still here . He can just manually override the controls . That 's why I had to come . I shorted the manual controls . [ Electricity zapping ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Music ] No ! [ Grunts ] [ Button beeps ] Lincoln , come in . Damn it , Lincoln ! Do you copy ? - Lincoln . Lincoln . - [ Groans ] I 'm here . What are you doing ? This is crazy . This is my purpose . I know that now . - W-Why ... Why would you ... - I was the only one who could fry the manual controls to make sure this worked and to make sure ... - you didn 't try to do this yourself . - No . No . It 's supposed to be me . I saw the future . This is my destin ... Yeah , sorry . I stole it from you . [ Music ] This is not how it 's supposed to be . [ Voice breaking ] It should be me to fix the damage to my friends , to you . You can 't just die for me like this . It 's ... It 's wrong . I don 't know . Saving the girl that I love and the world at the same time ? Feels pretty right to me . [ Buttons beep ] [ Monitor beeping ] The jet 's shaking pretty good . I hope it ... together . [ Static ] Lincoln , you 're breaking up . The communication system 's dying . I must 've fried that , too . Lincoln , I can 't take it if you ... [ Crying ] You ... can 't do this . I wouldn 't have thought so , either , but here I am . No , you ca ... you ca ... you can 't do this . Not like this . I can 't just ... I can 't just say goodbye . I ... I have too much I want to say . Me , too . Come to think of it , I just did . I mean , I tried , and we didn 't even realize it . Realize what ? A moment ago . The first time I said I lo ... [ Static crackles ] [ Static ] Daisy ? [ Panting ] Daisy ? [ Breathing slows ] Try to sway me if you want , but there 's no turning this thing back around . I can see that . I think we 're already gonna share a connection as we experience the one thing that 's eluded me all these years . Death . [ Music ] Daisy : Turn it back . - Turn it back . Turn it back . - Can 't . Remote access is offline . You have to . You have to . Help me , Coulson . Even then , the Quinjet 's not designed to maneuver in space , Daisy . No . [ crying ] We have to at least try , Coul ... He wouldn 't want us to . - He 's paying for my mistake . - No . He 's paying for all our mistakes . [ Music ] - Well , I got to see the world . - It 's beautiful . - Smaller than you imagine . - Yeah . - I only wanted to make it better . - I know . To feel a connection . But you must feel that already ... to sacrifice for them ... with all their flaws . They 're only human . [ Music ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Music ] So , what now ? [ Police radio chatter ] _ _ _ _ [ Sighs ] Hey , I got us some sandwiches . - You should ... - They 're here . Early today . - Well , you should eat . - I will . After the meet . I don 't know why you 're so sure today 's the day . I mean , you said the same thing a week ago . - Just got a feeling . - Okay . Well , I 'm gonna eat . I wanted to thank you . The money was too generous , and to help us relocate ... I was treated as a pariah back home . - Do you like animals ? - Yeah . Your dad made this . It 's a robin . Like you . [ Music ] She 's here ! All units move in . Go , go , go ! You 've been a real friend . I actually wanted to introduce you to a friend of mine . He has a practice near here . I think you 'd get along . He likes animals , too . Polly : You 're too kind . I 'm just keeping a promise . [ Music ] [ Tires squealing ] [ Tires screech ] [ Music ] [ Rumbling ] [ Tires screech ] [ Panting ] Seal the perimeter ! But you won 't find her . Call the Director . We struck out again . - That 'll take us off her trail . - And call in the National Guard , yeah . Where will we be assigned ? Guess we 'll have to wait and see . [ Music ] Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . [ Electricity buzzing ] [ Classic music plays ] Aida : Welcome back , Dr. Radcliffe . Hold my calls , Aida . Today is a special day . Where 's my boy Fitz ? Did he get the invite ? Leopold had to decline . He 's organizing a surprise for Jemma . Right . All right . Well , we 'll just have to celebrate alone , my dear . What will we be celebrating ? Today was your last day of hearings . Yes , name 's been cleared ... with a few stipulations , of course , but that 's not why I am cracking open a 40-year-old ... [ Sniffs ] Balvenie . [ Chuckles ] I don 't see anything else on the calendar . I had hoped to bring Fitz in on this . You are fond of Agents Fitz and Simmons . That I am . Put the two of them together , and you 've got a younger me . [ Chuckles ] Plus , it would be fitting . This is based on an old S.H.I.E.L.D. program . [ Monitor beeps ] [ Sighs ] Poor kids have had a lot of friends die . Maybe they didn 't have to . Is that what we 're celebrating today ... the inclusion of your new colleague Fitz on this project ? No , Aida . Today ... [ Switch clicks ] [ Whirring ] Today 's your birthday . [ Music ]

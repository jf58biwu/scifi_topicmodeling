 Previously on " Agent Carter " ... As of this moment , Howard Stark is a fugitive from justice . You 're the only one that can clear my name . - What 's in the vial ? - Steve Rogers ' blood . You lied to me . I knew how much Steve meant to you , because I know how much he means to me . After seeing that kid in Russia , I 'd hate to tangle with one that 's all grown-up . Focus . Please . Because we have something very important to take care of . He got in my head . It 's in the final stages . Promise me you 'll get the son of a bitch who did this . - Chief ! - Chief ! We need to find out what Ivchenko took . Item 17 . It 's gone . What 's that do ? I have no idea . Three out of four famous Hollywood stars recommend Diamond Toilet Soap for high-quality complexion care . Be a Diamond girl . Only 39 cents for two bars . And now back to our program . When we last left our hero , Captain America had saved the 25th infantry , but his plane was going down over the Sea of Japan . Betty , I 'm afraid this is the end . Oh , cap , there will never be another man like you . I love you , Captain America . But Betty Carver , face wet with loving tears , hears only static . You 're the SSR folks ? What the hell happened here , detective ? Hell if I know ... I got 47 dead , heads bashed in , eyes gouged out ... Not a single survivor . Good lord . It 's like some kind of monster got in . Never seen anything like it . All this happened inside the theater ? This way . No monster killed these people . They killed each other . Guess you G-men catch stuff like this all the time . No . No , we sure don 't . Sousa ! Sousa ! Hey . Hey . What happened ? Daniel ! Get him off ! ♪ Never treats me sweet and gentle ♪ This really is an amazing city . - ♪ The way he should ♪ - It 's like any other . No , no , my dear . - ♪ I 've got it bad ♪ - This is a testimony - to American strength and ingenuity . - ♪ and that ain 't good ♪ Huh ! It is a beacon for all the world to envy . And won 't it be fun to tear it all down ? ♪ My poor heart is sentimental ♪ ♪ Not made of wood ♪ ♪ I 've got it bad ♪ ♪ and that ain 't good ♪ ♪ But when the fish are jumping ♪ Let us not bring unwanted attention to ourselves . ♪ And Friday rolls ... ♪ Good evening , officer . Did I do something wrong ? Well , ma 'am , there 's a small matter of that traffic light you missed back there . I did ? ! Oh , my gosh ! I am just the silliest goose . You 're lucky you didn 't get in an accident . I am so sorry , officer . You know , I would let my grandfather drive , but ... he 's blind in one eye . Wartime injury . Okay , ma 'am . Just be careful . Get home safe . Thank you , officer . You are just the kindest man . All cars , be on the lookout for a vehicle last seen in the vicinity of 65th and Park . Black Dynaflow , license three-yankee-six-zulu . Vehicle is reported stolen by an armed female ... Blonde , 5 ' 8 " . All patrolmen must proceed with caution . Carter , what the hell is going on ? I was about to ask you the same thing . How are you feeling ? Like I swallowed a bag of shrapnel . What 's with this ? Do you remember anything that happened inside the movie theater ? There was , uh , some kind of gas . You found the canister , and you attacked agent Thompson . I wanted to kill him . I wanted to kill ... everybody . Oh , God , Peggy . I-I hit you . I-I 'm so sorry . You weren 't yourself . How are you now ? I still want to kill Thompson , but no more than usual . Best the scientists can figure , it 's a chemical that induces psychosis upon exposure , which I can personally attest to after Sousa tried to bite my nose off . Hey , killer . I 'm surprised Howard would consent to manufacturing something like that . The amount that got me was tiny . How much of this stuff does Ivchenko have ? The lab counted 10 canisters . Meaning Ivchenko has enough to send half the city into a homicidalage . But why ? Why go to all that trouble ? 'Cause he 's a Russian jerk with a chip on his shoulder . Why else ? No , I-it 's got to be something more than that . Ivchenko has a plan . He brought us into Russia . He tricked us into bringing him into this country . There 's something specific that he is targeting . We just have to find out what it is . The target is me . Hey ! Get your hands up . Get your hands up ! Told you . What kind of welcome is this ? How the hell did you get in here ? You know who designed the SSR security system ? Yeah , the same outfit that sures the White House . Exactly . They stink . You should have hired me . I know . You missed me . - Than guilty . - How about looking wrong ? As of this moment , you 're under arrest , Stark . You know , I could help you with that . Roger Dooley is dead . Ray Krzeminski is dead . Along with a theater full of innocent people . Stark Industries ... That 's all on you . You got something funny to say about that ? I know . That 's why I came back . That 's everything there is to know about the battle of Finow . I really don 't care about some old war story . Well , you should . 'Cause all those deaths are on me , too . The gas is called midnight oil . You designed a poison gas , Howard ? No ! Well , not intentionally . The army wanted something that would keep soldiers awake for days at a time , but it failed . Caused symptoms similar to sleep deprivation ... Anger , hallucinations , psychosis . If you knew all that , why use it in Finow ? I didn 't . My lab was raided . They took my samples , my research , all on the orders of general mcginnis . The next day , they dropped it on the Russians to help them take Finow . I flew there afterward to see with my own eyes . What those men did to each other , you can 't imagine . We don 't need to imagine . We saw it in that theater . I experienced it myself . And you survived ? It 's been known to cause asphyxiation . Guess that explains my sore throat . It also explains our voiceless friends . Someone performed laryngotomy procedures on these men . I expect it was Dr. Ivchenko or , as he 's also known , Johann Fennhoff . Who ? A psychiatrist with a speciality in hypnosis . Must be how they got to Dooley . And if he can control the chief , we 're all at risk . No . This time , I 'm taking the risk . This Fennhoff obviously wants to punish me , so ... let 's give him what he wants . What are you talking about ? I 'll be the bait . The SSR just needs to set the trap . Yeah . Something public . Real showy . Well , that 's the only way I do it . Hey , this is private property . I 'll take care of it . Hey , mister . Could you help me with something ? We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin . Howard Stark returns a hero . The eccentric billionaire and erstwhile absconder from justice ... is in New York today to announce a major breakthrough in the case of his missing technology . Mr. Stark will hold a press conference this afternoon ... On the steps of City Hall with all the details . What are you waiting for ? Let 's get in there . A new opportunity has arisen . Just since I left the car ? We are going back to the city . Our plans have changed . How 's that look ? Like a nest of spiders with very short legs . That 's good enough . Hey , Peg , you got any powder ? I want to cut down the shine . I don 't like this , Howard . It 's too dangerous . don 't waste your breath , Miss Carter . I 've already wasted mine on the subject . What is that ? It 's body armor for your protection . It 's junk . Where 's my stuff ? What are you people doing ? These are highly volatile materials . This ... This is photosensitive . This should be kept in the dark . This ... This should be kept cool . And this . This is fine now . Howard , what are you hoping to accomplish with this ridiculous press conference ? There are other ways to get Fennhoff into the open . Name one . No , name three . There it is . Stops a .50-cal round from 100 feet . Unless you 're planning to put it on your head , it won 't be enough . I trust you to keep me safe . - You 're punishing yourself . - I 'm redeeming myself . I have enough blood on my hands . I don 't need yours , as well . I 've had to go through my life not caring what people think of me , but I do care what you think . And after everything you said to me last time , I thought ... Howard , I was angry . That doesn 't mean I want you to die . Well , that makes two of us . But you know and I know that this is my fault . General McGinnis stole midnight oil and used it recklessly . He is at fault . Can you not see that ? I need to fix this . Otherwise , I won 't be able to live with myself . You 're mad . As a hatter . After a thorough investigation , we have concluded that Howard Stark is innocent of the theft and sale of weapons to foreign enemies . All charges against Mr. Stark have been dropped . We owe Mr. Stark a tremendous debt of gratitude , and his assistance in our current investigation is invaluable . " Hero . " " He is a hero . " He is ... a hero for all Americans . Are the rooftops covered , Agent Comden ? - Mr. Stark will be working in concert with the SSR ... - All clear . - They 're here somewhere . - To bring those responsible for this crime ... - I know it . - To justice . " Humbled by his genius . " No . No . " Brilliance . " " Humbled by his brilliance . " Hmm . We are humbled . Here 's Howard Stark . Mr. Stark , have all your weapons been recovered ? Is it true that you were hiding at the residence of Barbara Stanwyck ? For too long now , the name Howard Stark has been dragged through the mud . Today is a day of reckoning for anyone who doubts ... Get down ! Who 's got eyes on the shooter ? It 's coming from above . Get him out of here . Police car in the back alley . - This way . - Go ! They 're shooting from the hotel . See ? Told you it was a great idea . Your genius knows no bounds , sir . Take us to the SSR , officer . Oh , no . Listen , buddy , stop the car . Dr. Fennhoff would like to see you . Agent ! Where 's Stark ? He 's been taken . Where are they ? This rifle was rigged to fire itself . They 're long gone . Strange . What 's that ? Either Dottie 's a terrible shot , or this gun was never supposed to kill Howard . It 's aimed well above the podium . It was a diversion . Diversion from what ? All agents , Stark 's been grabbed . APD is being issued . He 's in a police car heading west . Oh . Whatever Fennhoff is paying you , I can double it . You like cars ? Yeah , I like cars . You know , I got a fleet of Cadillacs . You can take your pick . Take two . All right . You see this piece of paper ? It 's Rosalind Russell 's private number . That is absolutely my final offer . So , now we got to tell the whole world we 're chumps . They 've been planning this whole thing since the beginning . No , they couldn 't have . Could they ? Kidnapping Howard couldn 't have been part of their original plan . They didn 't know he was here until the press conference . So if they don 't want him dead , what do they want ? Howard said Fennhoff wants to punish him . Whatever they 've planned , it must be a fate worse than death . We need to determine what his next target is . The movie house was a test . So they got to be planning something bigger . Statue of Liberty ? Empire State ? What day is it ? May 8th . V.E. Day . They 're going to hit Times Square . Car 's near 42nd and 9th . No Stark . 42nd and 9th , copy . This isn 't good . No , it isn 't . I know I should be afraid for my life , but there 's just something about you that puts me at ease . Must be those eyes . You don 't remember me , do you ? Should I ? You and I spent a nice weekend together not too long ago . Is it Alice ? Guy at the coffee shop saw a blonde forcing a man matching Stark 's description into the back of a black Sedan . They were last seen heading west towards Lincoln Tunnel . I radioed their descriptions to Port Authority ... See if we can snag them at the tolls . They 're trying to leave the city . Why ? Maybe we were wrong about the target . Just talked to every muckity-muck in the city , trying to call off the V.E. day celebration . They won 't do it . Already 100,000 people packed into Times Square . We won 't have enough time to evacuate . He could have stashed those canisters anywhere . The gas was designed to be deployed by air . Which is why we shut down all the airports ... And every private airfield in the area . I think I know where Dr. Fennhoff is headed . Where ? If his intention is to place blame for the attack on Mr. Stark , would it not be most effective to use one of Mr. Stark 's own planes ? He can 't . We confiscated them all . Not all . Hmm ? There is another vault ... Considerably larger than the first . Howard , I can 't see a thing . Howard . Is all this yours ? Every one of them . You want to go for a ride ? I think you 've had a few too many Martinis to fly a plane . - You 'll be perfectly safe . - Hmm . Three of them fly themselves . I like a man with a vault full of toys . Well , you should see what I got at home . Wait . don 't tell me . Is it Lorraine ? All right . It 'll come to me . The great Howard Stark . I have heard much of your genius . It is a shame that you put your gifts towards creating such horrible weapons . Midnight oil was not supposed to be a weapon , Dr. Fennhoff . Should never have been used . And yet , it only exists because of you . Do you know what your creation does ? I saw it ... afterwards . And I saw it while it happened . I was only spared because I had a gas mask to protect myself . My comrades were not so lucky . My brother wasn 't so lucky . When I found him , he had no eyes . Pieces of his flesh had been bitten off . Can you imagine this ? I am sorry . You have no idea how sorry I am . Since that day , I have thought of you often . In fact , you have been my singular focus . Look , if you 're gonna kill me ... Go ahead . I probably deserve it , but ... Leave innocent people out of it . I have no intention of killing you , Mr. Stark . I am going to make you suffer . Please . Please don 't do this . You feel guilt ? Remorse ? Yes , of course , I do . I imagine you have done many things in your life that you regret . Hmm . A man such as yourself cannot allow kindness and empathy to cloud his vision . I am not a bad person . Yes . Yes , you are . It is the only way to achieve such remarkable success . Others have paid the price . You have paid the price , as well . Your guilt eats you , destroys you from the inside out . Yes . Yes . Focus . There may still be a way to atone for your sins . Simply focus . Go back in your mind to a time and a place that holds your greatest shame , and simply focus . What would you change if you could ? Mr. Stark ! Mr. Stark , we picked up a signal from the Valkyrie . We think it might be Rogers . Sir , we found Captain America . Howard . Peg , is this real ? Bring him home . Howard ! How long until he reaches New York ? 12 minutes . Maybe less . Maybe we could talk him down . You think he 'd listen ? Chief did . Radio room ? Second floor of the hangar . - I need someone to take one of those planes up . - Why ? Shoot him down with a plane full of poisonous gas ? You 'd have to do it over the water before he reaches land . Geez . Well , I-I 'm not your guy . I never flown a plane before . Likewise . I have . Mr. Jarvis , I cannot ask this of you . Mr. Stark would want to be stopped by any means possible . We have little time . Help him get off the ground . Signal is still holding strong . Changing course to bearing 2-6-9 . Focus , Howard . You 're doing very well . Hands up . Ah , ah , ah , ah . Lose the gun . Move away from the radio slowly . Peggy , it 's so swell to see you . Isn 't this fun ? Full tank of gas , plenty of ammo ... You 're good to go . Excellent . Let 's go ! Jarvis , if you don 't leave now , don 't bother ! Look , I 've flown planes before . I 've just never shot a man down . If Carter finds this guy , you 'll never have to fire a shot . Let 's pray you 're right , Agent Thompson . Excellent . Focus . Howard ! Howard , it isn 't real ! Go . I used to be so jealous of girls like you . I would have done anything to walk like you , to talk like you . But now ... I can be anybody I want . Oh , I 've got a great idea . Ohh ! Maybe I 'll be an SSR agent next . What do you think of that ? I thought you 'd be better . Fennhoff 's escaped the radio room . We 'll get him . I 'll go around back . Sousa , don 't let him talk . If he talks , you 're dead . You , too , Jack . Dropping to 2,000 feet . Howard , it 's Peggy . Peg ! I found his signal ! I 'm almost there . No , you must listen to me . I 'm gonna bring him home , Peg . Fennhoff has put this fantasy in your mind . He 's trying to get you to deploy the gas over civilians . Don 't worry about that , Peg . There are no civilians where I am . Freeze ! Step away from him , or I will shoot ! I am unarmed , Agent Sousa . Hands up ! Now ! You will not shoot an unarmed man . It is not in your nature . Unlike Agent Thompson here , you are virtuous man . The war has damaged us all , has it not , Agent Sousa ? We will never be the men we once were . I 'm not listening to you . I have treated many injured soldiers , Agent Sousa , helped them to overcome their pain . All you have to do is focus . Focus on your pain . Howard , can you hear me ? You must come back . I know this sounds crazy , but that ... that guy , Fennhoff , he actually helped me . He ... he showed me how to do this . I 'm bringing Cap back , Peg . The men that you work with , they see you as broken ... half a man . And Agent Carter ... I see how you look at her , but she will never value you for the man that you are . How can she ? She feels only pity . But we can change all that if you just focus . Point your weapon at Agent Thompson ... And pull the trigger . Sousa ... Look at me . Don 't listen to him . Excellent . Focus . Shoot him . No . You snap out of it ! Was he saying something ? You son of a bitch . Howard , turn the plane around . Come back , and we 'll talk about it . I can 't do that . Done talking . N-no ... wait . Miss Carter ? Miss Carter , I have Mr. Stark 's plane in my sights . We are one mile from land . Miss Carter , should I take the shot ? Miss Carter ! Miss Carter ! Can you hear me ? ! Miss Carter ! Please ! Answer me ! No , I need more time . We don 't have more time ! Do not take the shot until I tell you , Mr. Jarvis ! Howard . Howard , Steve is gone . He died over a year ago . There 's something up ahead . It 's him ! I can fix this ! You don 't have to fix anything . Peg , all I 've done my whole life is create destruction . Project rebirth was ... He was the one thing I 've done ... That brought good into this world . Howard ... I know you loved him . I loved him , too . But this won 't bring him back . Howard , you are the one person on this earth who believes in me . I cannot lose you . We have to move on ... All of us . As impossible as that may sound , we have to let him go . Peg ? He was good before I got ahold of him , huh ? Yes . Y-yes , he w ... he was . Where are you ? Evidently , flying a plane ... to Manhattan . I guess you can explain that to me once I land . Mr. Jarvis , he 's all right . Stand down . Thank goodness . Tell Mr. Stark to follow me back . I 'll bring him home . You were gonna shoot me out of the sky ? Well , I thought that was what you would have wanted . No ! No , it 's not . And for future reference , under no circumstance would I want anyone to shoot or otherwise hurt me . You got that ? Your point is amply made , sir . Aw , you 're all right , Jarvis . As are you , sir . I owe you another one , pal . To be honest , I 've stopped counting , Howard . What are we gonna do about this guy ? I suggest we put him in the trunk until we can find a permanent way of preventing him from speaking . What about Miss Underwood ? I 'm afraid dottie escaped . I 'd wager we haven 't seen the last of her . Ida . That 's her name . I knew I 'd remember . Steel trap . Good work , Carter . Nice job . Well ... - Good morning , Peggy . - Mm-hmm . You 're here bright and early . I assume that means you 'll be staying with the SSR . Haven 't decided , actually . I just came to pick up my paycheck . Well , we 'll keep the desk for you , just in case . - Mm-hmm . - She 'll be back . Which one of you fellas is Jack Thompson ? That 's me . Walt Cooper , United States Senate . Walt . I just wanted to come down here and personally commend you for the fine work you and your team did . An attack on Times Square could have been a calamity , and what I hear is that you saved thousands of lives . The city and the country owe you a great debt . We need more men like Jack Thompson fighting for freedom and security . You 're all lucky that you work for him . I just did what needed to be done . Yeah . You play your cards right , son , and you could get a congressional honor out of this situation . The president wants to thank you himself . Maybe next time , I 'll vote from him . - Come on into my office . - Thank you . How can you just sit there and take that ? Daniel . I 'm gonna tell that senator what really happened . Hell , I 'll tell Truman himself . It really doesn 't bother me . Well , it bothers the hell out of me . I saved that jerk 's life . I don 't need a congressional honor . I don 't need Agent Thompson 's approval or the president 's . I know my value . Anyone else 's opinion doesn 't really matter . Uh , hey , I was gonna ... grab a drink . Right at this moment ? It 's 9 : 00 in the morning . No , no . After I clock out . - Oh . - Want to join me ? Uh ... Maybe another time , all right ? I-I 've got to meet a friend . - Sure . Sure thing . - Yeah . Another time . Oh , my God . You 're kiddin ' me . I know what you 're thinking , Miss Martinelli , and , yes . The drawing room has recently been refurbished in the neoclassical style . On the small side , isn 't it ? Well , it is one of Mr. Stark 's quainter residences , yes . " Quaint . " You could fit the entire apartment where I grew up in this room . Six bedrooms , eight bathrooms , a rooftop terrace for Al Fresco dining , and the library has a ... sufficient collection of first editions . And you 're saying we can stay here for free ? Since the unfortunate incidents at both your home and place of work , Mr. Stark has offered this residence to you and Miss Carter for as long as you might require it . It 's a bit far from the theater district . I 'll live with it . You got a phone ? I have to call my mother . Naturally . There 's a telephone in every room . Oh , my God ! Are you kiddin ' me ? ! How refreshing to meet someone who appreciates the finer things . I appreciate the finer things . I just don 't want to know what 's happened in and on the fine things . I imagine you 're looking forward to some peace and quiet . At the very least , having both feet on the ground . Yes , I 've allowed several of my duties to fall by the wayside of late . My next project is ... is quite engrossing ... A complete and total overhaul of the kitchen spices . Mm , fascinating ! But should you again find yourself in need of my services , I would be honored to assist you at a moment 's notice , Miss Carter . Thank you , Mr. Jarvis . Uh , w-where is Howard ? I haven 't heard from him . Presently attempting to negotiate the return of his property from the SSR . Well , let 's hope next time he builds a better vault . Actually , he 's decided to destroy everything . Really ? Well , that surprises me . He continues to believe that no government ... even our own ... can be trusted with those particular inventions . Especially ... this . Howard is giving me this ? He is under the impression that the sample of Captain America 's blood was lost when he was under Dr. Fennhoff 's control . So you are giving me this . I owe Howard Stark a great deal , but he does not own my integrity . I am quite certain there is only one person in the world who knows what to do with this ... You , Miss Carter . ♪ someday , when I 'm awfully low ♪ ♪ When the world is cold ♪ ♪ I will feel a glo just thinking of you ♪ ♪ And the way you look tonight ♪ ♪ Oh , but you 're lovely ♪ ♪ With your smile so warm ♪ ♪ And your cheeks so soft ♪ ♪ There is nothing for me ♪ - ♪ But to love you ♪ - Bye , my darling . ♪ Just the way you look tonight ♪ What did you say ? I can 't hear you . You 're gonna have to speak up . Don 't despair , friend . The food here is actually quite good . Hmm . A minor consolation , I know . You had a vision , and it didn 't come to pass . What is the point of anything now ? But given time and a bit of quiet , new visions will arise . I am familiar with your work on matters of the mind , Herr Doktor . It would give me great pleasure to hear your thoughts on this . Perhaps there is another way for us to collaborate . I know things seem bleak , but you are , in fact , a fortunate man . You 're imprisoned , yes , but it is an American prison . And America ... is the land of opportunity .

I 'm a publicist for a fine Vancouver Police department . - Your name is Victory ? - Yeah , my parents were a bit optimistic . Just call me Vic , alright ? We 've got to bring you right to the station . Maybe a quick stop for some new clothes . Who dressed you , anyways ? My mother ? My mother ! - Listen , this kid is photogenic . He 's been on the news all night . No ! We are in an election cycle right now . So , unless you want to lose this one for us , you better start working at it and do what it takes ! Where is Victory and that kid ? I know ! I just want the mayor to get a bit of face time with him beforehand . Play up the father-son feel to this ... thing , whatever the hell it 's becoming . The mayor is waiting over here . I wanted you to meet him before we got this all started . You know ? Get to know him a bit ? - What is this exactly ? - Victor , what is he wearing ? - Yeah , I don 't know , he just showed up ... looking like that . - Mr. Mayor , sorry we 're late . Problems at the Border . - So , is this another interview ? I mean , I haven 't even seen the questions . So you better have some damn good answers for me . - No , sir , this is the presentation with the young officer ? We 're at the Police Hall . The Magnusson boy , sir . - Oh , Vic . Magnusson ? I knew your father . - Well , that went well . Oh , dear . Girls , can you make him a little more presentable , please ? - Who ... who was that exactly ? - Christine ? - Yeah . - She 's the mayor 's ... uh , number 2 . She 's his right hand ... Woman . - Good afternoon , ladies , gentlemen , members of the press , who we know are no gentlemen or ladies , without adieu Vancouver , your mayor , Ted Brower . - Thank you . Thank you all very much for coming today . Now , before I introduce to you a very bright young man , a shining example of what we do best in this city , I 'd like to share with all of you first a little history . Many years ago , our great city went through what I can only describe as a waking nightmare . As those waters rose and swallowed up our lives , those same waters seem to swallow up our compassion as well . But in those dark days , there were shining lights . Those of us such as Dr. Aaron Magnusson , who worked tirelessly to ensure that ordinary people could make the transition to a new reality . And while the doctor and I could seldom agree on the means , we both knew that the end , the single most important end , was to help people like these . And the fact that I can stand here on stage with the son of my fiercest political opponent , is evidence of that . So I would ask you to give a warm welcome to a very brave young man . Mr. Aiden Magnusson . Aiden , come on up here , son . Now , in recognition for your work in getting a very dangerous criminal off our streets , we , the citizens of Vancouver Free Territory commend you and offer you a position of the Central Force . In Sector one . How 's it feel to be a hero , son ? Kids . Couldn 't get them to stop talking back there . - Mr. Mayor , what was your relationship with ... ? - Now ... - Mr. Mayor , what are you gonna do now . - Officer Magnusson 's had a very long and tiring day , so I think any other questions should be left for a more appropriate timing ? - Mr. Mayor , what was your relationship with ... ? - Thank you for coming . Thank you . - Mayor , Mayor . - Officer Magnusson ... - What was your relationship ... - Mr . Mayor . Excuse me , Mayor . - Officer Magnusson , what do you think ... - Politics are for politicians . Do they think I need more budget ? - Uh ... - What I don 't need is more new recruits . - Uh , sir , actually , I 'm on active duty , I was at ... - I don 't want you here . So you ... are going to be a quiet little thing . A goldfish . Every now and then I 'll open your tank and feed you . And that 's all I will hear from you . And if you cause me or my men any trouble , I will personally drive your sorry ass back to the wall and put you through the door . Do you understand me ? - Yes , sir . - Have Constable Mercer and Miss Duluk come here immediately . Constable Mercer . Corrin . This is Aiden Magnusson , he 's our newest recruit . - Hello , Corrin Duluk . - Hi , I 'm Jeff . Heard about you on the news . Welcome . - Mr . Magnusson is a friend of the Mayor 's . He 's formally Sector 2 . Now , he has some patrol experience , and I want you two to bring him up to speed on how a real police department functions . Constable ? - Yes ? - Constable Mercer ... I am assigning recruit Magnusson to you for guidance and evaluation . Miss Duluk is our department coordinator . She 'll fill you in on the day-to-day operations of the department and also take care of your lodging situation . Alright . Let 's get going . Stop wasting time here . - This is our forensic lab . Most of our new field equipment is linked into the system , making this obsolete . - You mean making me obsolete . - Always trying to find a way , Brian , but you keep hanging on . Dr. Walcott is largely responsible for our citywide cataloging system . Doctor , this is Aiden Magnusson . - Yes , I 've read the news . I know who Mr. Magnusson is . Very pleased to meet you . I knew your father . I knew him well . But Corrin , this is much , much more than a catalogue system . This is a web that touches all of us . It connects us , keeps us safe . You know , the possibility of a crime going undetected in this city ... - Doctor , I know this is all very exciting for you , but Aiden has a lot more to see today . - Oh , yes , yes ... of course . You 're welcome back any time . I knew your parents ; I knew them very well . - Here 's the kitchen , the living area , You have everything you need . This beautiful city view , it 's nice . I think you 'll like it here . - Today , an in depth look at the fallout from the shock arrest of Nicholas Filtano . Aaron Magnusson 's Anti-Wall party falls at the hands of his own son . - Can 't get enough of it , huh ? This really is bordering on gloating . Follow me , I 'll show you the rest . - Garbage bag ? - You tell me you 've never run out of clean laundry ? - ... three and area we 're seeing mainly clear skies and above seasonal temperatures , still 13 degrees , right now and the sea wind ... - But where did he come from ? You know , I 'm tempted to think that the mayor has a team of people following his opponents around day and night . That 's ridiculous , that 's ridiculous , mark . - Waiting to set them up ! - Can 't you set politics aside for one second and see that this is more than just a petty crime ? I 'm just saying it has the Hallmarks of ... - Hallmarks of what ? A movie script ? - Let me ... let me finish , okay ? - Now , look , all ... all I 'm saying is something doesn 't sit right . I think that anyone can look at this grotesque political theater this afternoon and see something is wrong . - I see some theatrics , but they 're not coming from Mayor Brower . - Ah , but who is this guy ? Who is he ? He 's ... he 's a .. a Sector 2 ... He 's the son of a terrorist . - What ? - Think about it . - That 's ridiculous . What info do we have aside from his original Helix ? A work record ? We ... we placed a call this afternoon to sector 2 four 's and got a glowing recommendation from a Chief Kruspe and I quote " Yeah , he 's a good kid . " - Yeah . - Yeah , hardly fitting for someone who just today was receiving an honor in our city . Full systems 's match , full systems 's match . - No , that 's not ... that 's a ... - No , that means 100 % accurate DNA match to all records . That and the eyewitness account of this young hero . We were discussing the recent shock arrest of Nicholas Buchenan . - Have you sent any arrest order ? - Yeah , I 'll do that right now . What is he doing ? - Excuse me , please . Officer Magnusson , can we talk ? - Oh , yeah , sure . What are you doing ? - Uh , this guy here says he saw five guys leaving the apartment . - Hmm , and our guys were scouting here for over an hour . - I don 't know . He sounds pretty certain he saw five . - I see . Well , we 've already sent in the arrest order , now if you want to bring it up with the chief when we get back , file an alternate report . - Uh ... Nah , it 's not necessary . I mean , he 's probably just confused , right ? - Thank you very much for your time , unfortunately he 's new to this force and ... - So , bro , you ready to do this or what ? - Listen , don 't worry . We talked to Mercer , he 's not gonna be around . We 'll get you into something . - Or someone , whichever you want , huh ? Let 's do this . - Hey . Please , aren 't you ... that super cop guy or whatever ? Oh , man that 's awesome . I can 't believe you 're here . Can I buy you a drink ? - Kathy ? - Huh ? Huh ? Yeah ! Here it is ... okay ... - Aiden , you have a message . - Ooh , a girly computer , huh ? What else do you got over there ? - Playback , please . - Aiden ! Hey , fool , it 's Barrett . Ha ha ... can you believe ... - Ah , boring . - ... I have to call you from the station ? You 're restricted from my phone . - I know , why don 't you show me around your house ? - So you 're gonna have to call me next time . You better ! Because you are gonna get me out there Friday night , or else ! Other men won 't shut up about it . I 'm serious this is creeping me out . Just looking at me funny . Ah ! - Okay , now , I pay my taxes . I wanna see what I 'm getting for my money . Huh . Come on , Aiden . Discipline , obeying the orders , isn 't that what you 're all about ? Drop ' em . Ha ... oh , my ... you 're a cop , Aiden , not a soldier . No need to stand at attention . I know . Policeman 's blah . Dance , baby , dance . Yeah . Perfect . Perfect . Yeah . - What are you doing ? - Oh ... I got what I came for . Honey , you ... you don 't think we were gonna ... ? Oh ! No , no , no ... you see , this here , this is a filth free zone . Sort of been a little misunderstanding . I thought you knew where you came from . - Like we were supposed to believe this super cop couldn 't catch Filtano himself ? The guy 's like , fifty or something . Mayers Hamilton , - Mercer ? Who 's your new partner ? - Hey ! It 's Dr. Funky ! - So , who 's your new friend ? - We found this little cockroach sneaking through a break in the wall . - Like we just wouldn 't notice you ! Can you believe this ? They 're like rats ! We get rid of the little ones and the real ones start coming through . This wall isn 't doing shit . - Man , I can smell it from here . They all stink . It 's too bad , though . - Looks like it should be a lot of fun if you cleaned her up a bit . A little too much open sewer , if you ask me . - Hey . Uh ... What are you guys gonna do with this ... uh , skunk ... ? - Ha ! Skunk ? You got a load of this guy ? I don 't know . Man , let 's get the soap . The mayor will just ... Hey ! - She 's not breathing ! She 's not breathing ! Mercer , you gotta call medic or something . - Well , he 's ... this guy 's ... she 's fine , man . Everything 's gonna be back on in a minute . - She 's not fine . Mercer , call medic . - I don 't know , guys , maybe we should call medic . - Meds don 't have time for shit like this . She 'll be fine . What the fuck 's wrong with you , Jeff ? - Nice ! Don 't look now . You really got to watch where you drop your pants . That 's gonna trip you up one day . - Hey , Jeff ... if I ... want to get back to sector 2 for something , would that be hard to do ? - Well , uh ... You got your police badge , so that might get you across without too much trouble , and it 's all run on system , so , technically , you know ... - And the Filtano arrest , I want to take a look . How do I go about doing that ? - The Filtano arrest ? Why would you want to ... don 't worry about it , kid . This will all blow over in a couple of days . Ha , ha , ha , ha ... - Hey ! That 's it . - Here . Got a key . Twenty times speed . Stop playback . Resume playback . Fuck . Enhance scan . Repeat scan . Upload files . Hey ! - Have I seen a ghost ? - Huh ? - Huh ? I like the new cloth . I almost buy the badges this time . - Hey , I was trying to help . It was just that you ... - Yeah , big help . Big cop . Big pig . I was thinking how you must have helped when I woke up in a pile of rocks out here . - I had nothing to do with that . - Yeah , but you had nothing to undo with it either , did you ? - What were you expecting ? You just broke through the wall . - Maybe I came to look for you . Friend . - Attention , this checkpoint is now closed and will resume processing at 8 AM . - Welcome back , Mr. Magnusson . - Keep walking , Constable . - Sir ? - Magnusson . How does unauthorized work hour visits over the wall constitute staying out of my hair ? ! - Sorry , sir , I had to grab something from my old place . - Alright , little goldfish , that 's your first warning . Don 't count on a second . Leave , Magnusson ! - Oh , hello , Aiden . - Hello , Doctor . - I 'm glad you stopped by . Now , what can I help you with ? - I 'm not sure exactly . Can I ask have there ever been any kind of ... incorrect ... situations with the system ? - So it appears he is his father 's son after all . Aiden , I have worked with this system for twenty years , I have worked on it for over thirty years , and I have never been witness to any ... problem , as you put it . To put it simply , by gathering bio information on everybody here ... - I understand , I got that , I understand the principle , I just ... I think that I have a video clip here . I 'm not sure what kind of analysis you can run in it . - What is it ? Where did you get it ? - Uh ... off the system , standard read . - Uh-huh ... you managed to convince the chief to let you do that ? Well , that 's quite an accomplishment . You may have a little bit of that politician in your blood after all . - That 's not something to be proud of , I don 't think . - Oh , I don 't know about that . There are some good ones . Your parents . - My father was an idiot . Put politics before his family . - Oh , well , now that 's not very fair . - With all respect , sir , you didn 't have to live out there . - There 's nothing on this . No , there are no files on this device . - I don 't understand ; I tested this . - Well , don 't worry , just go speak to the chief , bring me another copy , and I 'll be happy to look at it again . - Yeah , okay , I 'll do that . I got to get going . Thanks doctor . - No , call me Brian , and , uh , my door is always open Aiden ? I 'm sorry about earlier ; I didn 't mean to . - Screen on . Reference Filtano personal or media files . Is there a helix sample ? Restricted by who ? - That information is not available . - Uh ... Sector One access Aiden Jasper 34 Echo . Bring up recent arrest files for any state council members . Bring up over the last two years . Three years . Reference Aaron Magninsson - I hope you 're not just here to tease the guy . That would be cruel and unusual punishment . That is still illegal here , you know . - Don 't worry , I wouldn 't do anything you guys wouldn 't . - Yeah , that 's what I 'm worried about . Right over there , through that door . Mr. Filtano , you have a visitor . You have twenty minutes . - You won 't need it . - Mr . Magnusson , I hadn 't expected to see you here today . Through accepting medals in my honor ? - Mr . Filtano ... I just had a few questions about your case . - Yeah , well , I 've got a few questions of my own if you don 't mind . Like " what the hell are you doing here ? " Come here to win yourself another promotion ? - No , I 've ... been looking into your file and I 've noticed ... a few things ... not quite right . - " Not quite right . " That 's rich . 'Cause I 'd say there are a few things that are quite wrong . I 'm in prison ! - Sir ! Sir ! - Guards ! - I just need your help to understand a few things . Maybe I can help . - Well , you certainly can 't make things much worse , can you ? - I looked into the checkpoint records . It has you passing through several times . The dates and the times match up . So , I need to know , from you , why you 're in Sector 2 . It 's ... It 's unusual . - Well , let 's just say that there are things that one can do and get out there that would offend our Puritanical little city . Is that what Brower wanted to hear ? I 've never been an idiot . Guards ! - Aiden , there 's an intruder . Building security has been notified . Calm preset activated . Would you like anything else , sir ? - Open the door ! Open the door ! We know that you 're hiding ! - Remember me ? Here 's something you won 't forget . Nice , Peters , be nice . Hello , Constable Magnusson . How are you feeling ? - Good . - So , we 've done a quick look through your place and secured the system until the unit has been compromised . You will have to speak with someone about that . So , that leaves us with a scan . Guys , can we clear out for a scan here ? Thanks . Now , the process is pretty straightforward , the scanner is connected to the system at all times , there 's not much for you to do except drive it , really . Now , first we do an auto scan , there 's some advanced filters to ignore the data from dust , which is mostly dead skin . But otherwise , this picks up everything , from fingerprints , to hair , to blood . Anything the body spits out , the scanner will pick up . So , let me just eliminate the officers and the security , so , that leaves us with Valeri Konstov . Oh , well , that 's it . Cooper ! Let me get an arrest order right away . You guys , let 's pack it up . Let Mr. Magnusson get back to it . - Oh , wait a second . I don 't understand . Who is this guy ? - The guy that attacked you . - No , there 's no way it was him . Uh , who is he ? - Hey ... I don 't know what you 've done . He 's Sector 2 . That 's your turf , right ? A middle-level game boss . So , whatever you bring it , it has nothing to do with us . - Wait , what are you gonna do about security ? - Nothing to worry about . You got your guy . Okay guys , drop your cards , spit up your socks , let 's get out of here . - Big guys can be strong , too . - And what ? he took a little wheeze break after he climbed twenty-two floors to my balcony ? - The system doesn 't lie . - Yeah , well , not deliberately , anyways . - Aiden , good to see you . I was afraid maybe last time I had maybe just ... God , what happened to you ? - Yeah , that 's , uh ... kind of sort of what I 'm here about . - What is it ? - It 's ... uh ... I need you to find out who that is . Or isn 't . - Oh , exciting . Allow me to dust off my equipment . - Come on , doctor , you got this all polished up for something just like this . - So , how are you finding your new home ? And your new job , too , I suppose ? Boy , you know , that 's a lot of sudden change for one person to take . - Actually , I 'm ... I 'm going back tonight , I need a little decompression time . You 're more than welcome to come , if you 'd like . - Boy , I haven 't been downtown in ... must be fifteen years . Aiden , it looks like you 're the proud owner of one Mister ... Valeri Konstov . I don 't follow . Who is this man ? - Doc , this can 't be right . - Well , it 's a match under all conditions . There 's really no doubt . You know , to be honest , I 'm feeling a little nervous . I ... uh , hope nobody recognizes me . - All sectors with documentations must be present while you graduate . please have documentation ready for intermediate inspection . - This is my old cop shop . - This is a police station , is it ? It was never meant to turn up this way . I want you to understand that . You know , when things first started turning on for the worst , it was crime so much crime . Some terror and violence at the wall ... or ... that 's what you could have called it at that time . That was just good people , okay ? good neighbors . Defending their neighborhood . Keeping away all that ... romping violence . Your parents were right . They were right . And I know you don 't wanna hear that . - No . No . I know . - Who is it ? - Uh , hi , it 's the police . Is this Mrs. Filtano ? - Yes . What do you want ? - I just had some questions regarding your husband 's case . - At this hour ? I thought you guys always traveled in pairs . - Yeah , uh ... - Oh , you , huh ? I suppose you think I should thank you . Well , I won 't . You think I didn 't know he was seeing those women over there ? - That 's ... that 's not why I 'm here . - Why don 't you go talk to him yourself ? I 'm sure he 's give you his undivided attention . - I 've been to see your husband , and I need to ask you : what happened to his hand ? - Oh , I see ... You try and take my life away from me and now want me to help you do it for good ? I don 't think so . His hand was cut open days before you arrested him . So why don 't you try to fit that into your little story ? - Hey , is ... is there a hospital record ? - Go fuck yourself . - Yeah ? - Uh , I 'm here to see prisoner Fultano again . - Mr . Fultano is not receiving visitors today . - Since when are prisoners making those decisions ? I need to see him . - He 's restricted access , sir . - I thought you just said he wasn 't seeing anyone . - Yeah , well , whatever it is , you 're not seeing him . - Sorry , doctor . I 'm sorry sir . Can you bring up some files ? All the print matches from the Filtano case . - Yeah sure , let me get that . Oh , you 're in luck . They took several full hand prints from the body . - Ha ! - What ? I don 't see anything special . - Yeah , nothing . Filtano sliced up his hand a few days before the arrest . Badly . He 's still bandaged up . - But how can you be certain that didn 't happen while you were pursuing him ? Or even after that ? - I checked the hospital . It 's on record . - I had an analysis on that sample you gave me . There 's a problem / It 's a perfect match . See , our body undergoes constant assault from everything around us . It damages our cells , our DNA . Now , the body continually repairs what it can , but judging by this sample , Konstov has either lived his entire life in a lead box , or he 's only a few days old . - I ... I don 't understand ; why wouldn 't the system pick that up ? - The system has to be adaptable . Why would we set it to react when it 's a perfect match ? This is too good to be true . - Do you think somebody is stealing this infant samples ? - Oh , I can say with some certainty , no . No . Now , the amount of material we gather is one hundredth of what you scraped up from under your fingernails . - Who has access to these samples ? - Oh , unfortunately , that list would be in the hundreds . Even thousands . With official permission , that is . - And who gets this permission ? - Well that would be ... High level police officials for police access and ... uh ... high level city officials for everyone else . - So , not you , huh ? - No , I ... I can access these samples , but beyond that , I am purely decoration . - The chief . Hello , Corrin . - Good afternoon ... Aiden . What can I do for you ? - Actually , there 's two things you can do for me . And you gotta choose one . One - let me see who has been accessing helix samples . Or two - tell me where they keep this data . - Do you have any sort of official request ? You know I don 't have access to that information . - Come on , he 'd let me peak at the names . You work for the city and the department . All of the requests go through you , I know it . - They don 't , and I won 't . - It 's for an important investigation . It 's for Dr.Walcott. - I 'm sure it is . - Alright , then tell me where the Chief is . - He 's taking the day off . Now , that 's all you get . If you don 't mind ... - An address would be nice . - Goodbye , Mr. Magnusson . - Doctor ? Sir ! - What the hell are you doing here ? This is completely unacceptable . This is my home . My home ! - Sir ! I need ... - Whatever this is about , can wait until Monday morning .. ... when you hand in your badge . - No , sir . It can 't . The doctor and I found a serious breach in the system . - A breach ? - We need your permission to see who 's been accessing Helix catalogue . - What kind of breach , and why are you here and not one of our senior officers . - You know , that 's a good question . - Yeah , well , I 'm calling security . - Sir , there are innocent people in prison . I know Filtano couldn 't have done it . Somebody is using the helix catalog to fake evidence . The whole system 's been compromised . - Mr . Magnusson , what you 're telling me , is that some , possibly all of the prisoners that we have , are in there because our system is broken ? - Yes . - And that it took a washed up old hag and a second-rate security guard to bring it to the attention of an entire professional police force ? Just leave , Mr. Magnusson , leave now . Before I have you arrested . - Aiden , it 's me , Geoff . Open up ! - Constable Mercer is at the door . Would you like me to let him in ? - Aiden , this is not a joke . Open up ! - Alright , open up . - Aiden , Aiden , you need to leave now . They have a warrant out for your arrest . - He actually called me in ? What an asshole . - No , Aiden . Dr. Walcott is dead ! - What ? - And they want you for his murder . - The doctor 's dead ? - You have to get out of here , now ! They found his body this afternoon in his place . They came looking for you when he ducked out this afternoon , You gotta get out of here , out of Sector One . And if you can ; further . - I can 't . They 're gonna scan me at every checkpoint . How am I supposed to make it over that wall ? - I may be able to get you under it . - You got to find the man who attacked you . The man with the tattoos . You gotta prove this was a setup . - Is that a cop coming out of our tunnel ? - You gotta be kidding me . - Who 's the sarcastic bastard now ? - Fire ! - Suzanne ! - What ? Hello ? Who 's there ? - Barret , open up , it 's me . - Aiden ? Is that you , man ? Just a sec . Just a sec . Are you sure you can stomach our water there , tough guy ? Thought I lost you over there , man . What happened ? Look , I think I know a spot , alright ? You can lay low there , get some sleep , or whatever , alright ? Cool , yeah ? - Yeah . - A lot of these higher apartments aren 't safe to live in the full time , so they 're just gonna leave them empty , and Ihappen to have the keys . Some of them . Check it out . Real keys . Remember those ? Here it is . Oh , man . My little getaway . Welcome to paradise . Mi Casa es su Casa , my man . It 's great , right ? All vintage . - I found it just sitting here . - Nice little trip down memory lane , huh ? - Vintage , eh ? - Oh , yeah , you 'll like those . I mean , I 'm sure it 's nothing compared to the classy ass you 've been seeing lately , but it will do in a pinch . Alright . I 'll let you sleep . - Okay , thanks man . - Yeah . It 's nothing . - What 's up ? - Oh , hell . They 're back . - Aiden ... Aiden ... - The friends I was telling you about . - Come on , man ... You just left me here . - I told you I 'd get us in there . He didn 't leave me any choice . I gotta look after myself , too . And ... uh ... Ellie 's pregnant . You know what ? Fuck you . You think this is funny ? Say something ! - Stop talking . - Nice , Aiden , real nice . How long have we known each other ? - Seven years . - Yeah . - You must really piss some people off . Sometimes , I don 't like your job . But today isn 't one of those times . - Fuck you ! - Get up ! Ah , super cop . Greetings from the Mayor 's office . - I 'll look into that . - Go check that out . - Check . - Aiden ... Aiden ... Aiden ! It 's okay , it 's okay . - Did you ... did you ... - Yes . - Oh , thanks . - I 'm gonna check his pockets . I 'm gonna check the other guy . Nothing . - Oh , shit . Look at this uniform . Let 's get out of here . These guys stink . - Here . - And the search continues for Aiden Magnusson . Sector One 's most disgraced cop . - Here give it to me . I think I know what it is . It 's too cold . No ! No , no , no . No , no ! Damn it ! You did it ! - Shut up ! - Ellie ? Everything alright ? It 's Thomas , from next door . Ellie ? Ellie , I need to know everything 's alright . I don 't want to have to break the door , now . Ellie ! - Hi , hi ... Hi , Thomas . I 'm fine ! - Ellie ? I 'm going to have to ask you for the safety word . Ellie ! - Don 't make us do this . - Ellie ! - Alright . Alright , you fuckers . Thomas ! - Ellie ! - It 's pony ! - There are too many cops here . Come on ! Let 's go ! Go to the city ! I know someone who 'll help us / Okay , cover your nose and mouth with this . This place is loaded with light . - What 's in there ? - Bug drug . - Who 's here with you ? Are you okay ? - No ! I know it 's wrong . ( indistinct ) I will give message to the boys and they will take care of it . So you don 't have . I 'm telling we 'll find him and I 'll fucking kill him myself ! If must . I 'm sure it 's Roman who frame me . I think he works at city . Okay . Give love . Yeah . Bye bye . Suzie , my little one . So , who is this guy ? - This is ... - Andrew . Hey . Nice to meet you . - Valeri ... Valeri Konstov . - Valeri Konstov . - Look , I get already tough day . I don 't have time for chitchat , so what 's bring you here , with your friend , Andrew ? - Well , we have police trouble . - At the city . - Oh , no , no , no ! That 's enough . I already get enough trouble with those peeps . I just get from the jail for something I 'm not even doing ! And I 'm not going back . Enough . - Larry ... you know I wouldn 't ask for something unreasonable . - First of all , I 'm not doing any business with anybody who I don 't know . In one moment , Mr. Andrew , you will put your hand here , for scanning . Where are you , piece of shit ? Ah , there we are . Put your hand here . - Identity Andrew Banks . - Hmm , Suzie . You must go out of city . Suzie , come here . Mr. Andrew , why not go , join the party ? - I think I 'm just gonna hang out over there . - Thank you . - Susan , take this ... for good luck . And Mr. Andrew , you have nice bracelet . - So , how are we gonna get out of here ? Because I can 't swim . - What was that ? - I was hoping you were gonna tell me . - I saw the face . It wasn 't yours . - I 'm still trying to figure that out . - What is that , Aiden ? - I don 't know . Why don 't you ask your friend ? He seemed pretty interested . - Well , if I listened to him , then I wouldn 't be here with you . - I don 't know what it is , okay ? - Unit 251410 transmit on tech . What 's your message ? - 142510 - This is the checkpoint he told us to go to , right ? - Yeah . - Okay . I 'll go through first . If I get through , maybe you can just follow . - Take this . Good luck . - Warning , unreadable helix . - What the ? What are you trying to pull ? You can just go through . - We 're having problems with the machine tonight , so you can just go / - Thanks . - You , too , Miss Hanbrook . - Hey , Suzie , let 's stop . I can 't do any more tonight . They 're like never ending fireworks . I 'm sure I remember going to them as a kid . My parents used to take me . It 's kind of ironic , because it used to mean summer is here . Now that doesn 't end either . - They 're so nice . Your parents , I mean , not the explosions . Do they live in the city ? - No . They don 't live in the city . I grew up with my aunt . - I 'm sorry . What happened to them ? - Well , they were both ... uh ... pretty active in community and politics . And ... uh , when the wall was going up , a bomb went off and ... didn 't do much to the wall , but my dad got fingered for it , so he had to disappear . I got shipped off to my Aunt Dressie 's . What about you ? - Oh , me ? I had a photograph of my parents . But I lost that , too . Um , but ... I was raised by my uncle Bill . I don 't really know if he was really my uncle . He was a seagull . A mean , drunk , bastard bird . - It 's beautiful . - Yeah , well , You didn 't have to live without it . - Wait ! Suzanne , where are you going ? I told you , I can 't swim ! - Keep heading east ! You 'll find them out there . - Find who ? - They 'll help you find who you 're looking for ! - Come back ! - I can 't ! I promised I wouldn 't go with you , Aiden . - This is insane ! Where am I supposed to go ? - Go east , Aiden ! - Don 't move ! Don 't you go anywhere ! I 'm not gonna rob you , but you could be robbing me . I got something you 're really gonna like here . That 's a little ... trade secret . Always start with a laugh . I should charge it a little bit , but I won 't . Perhaps an fine gentleman such as yourself could use an old-fashioned photo album . - Is there a house nearby that you got this from ? - I think I resent that . Yeah I resent what you 're implying . - This house , is it close to here ? - Ah , yeah , yeah , that 's ... that 's about a click down that direction , but you 'd be better off going in that direction . There 's a ... there 's an old art supply depot with some direction for you , so ... you could go . - Hello ? - Where 's the tattooed man ? - Take him outside . - I owe you half , yeah ? I owe you half . I owe you half ? - Fair and square . It 's half , yeah ? - Bullets . - Where 'd you get these ? Who gave them to you ? Who knows this guy ? - Uh ... I will look at this . - This " A " , does it stand for Aiden ? - Aiden ... That 's me . - Magnusson ... your dad always knew you would come . - Dad ? Do you know my parents ? Know him ? He made us . We were a bunch of disorganized lunatics before he came . - Where is he , then ? - ? - Hmm ? - A big man . We 've worked with him before . But not recently . He always seemed a bit concerned with his own interests . - Resonance . Frequencies interfering combined . Forcing assaults in this specific pattern . So , what are the helices screaming at us this time ? - Well , it 's definitely a map . It 's telling us to go here . - What ? It 's just a garbage dump . - You have to take me . Fillarri obviously wants me to go there . - No . This message was made for us . Fillarri would expect us to eliminate anyone we didn 't know carrying them . - That 's a digestor . I 'm not going anywhere near it . - I know what this is . - I 'll scout it tonight . - Well , I 'm going ? - What is it that you 're doing ? - You might need these to get in or out . Or who know ? Small explosives . Your father taught me how to do this . - By candlelight ? As long as it will take us together . - Well , that could take some time . - What the hell is that ? - I don 't know . It happens pretty often . The bacteria they 've created to digest the garbage . But if it gets out , it 's pretty much anything . Completely . - That 's him ! - Yeah , that 's Roman . He 's hired gun . - I need to get in there . - We 've got . I bet he has access to it . Information . - There 's a high value target in there . I think I might know what that is . - Okay , keep going this way . - Stop ! Stop ! - We 've got a situation . - Hey ! - Subtle . I like it . - You alright ? - No ! You ? - No ! - You got us an unexpected ? . What have you got ? - Aiden , you 're up . ? - Go . - Let me , Magnusson . Go . - Agent Lohman , get out of here ! Go ! - Where are they ? You are giving me a fucking headache ! Just stay put . - Davis . Wilkensen . What the hell is this doing here ? It 's scaring the shit out of me . ? - Wilkensen ! - You take the tables , I 'll go get the screens ! - Get your ass over here ! What are those screens doing out ? That should be first ! Get all those bracelets and preload . I want somebody ready to dump him if needed . You , I want all set , one data , purged Brower , Simmens , Fultano . Get ready to wipe it if I give the order . Actually , stop that . The guys that escaped couldn 't got far , there could be more . I need you to go to the North chamber . Could you at least fucking nod at me ? Get over there , now ! When you 're done in here , make sure everything is locked down . Alright ? All of it ! Fucking idiots . - Stop deletion ! Cancel ! Cancel deletion ! - This is becoming a habit showing up like this . Look , I obviously made a big impression on you . You remembered me . I knew you would , and I told you . But really , what the fuck are you doing here ? You were surprised there . You know , I just wanted to discuss this with you . You gotta go ahead and revert the fight ! Yeah , I forgot , super cop . You 're a quick little fucker . Look at me . Look at me ! Look at me ! Okay ! Okay ! Did you walk out , you son of a bitch ? ? - I didn 't kill anyone ! - When the order hits , they 're already dead . I just ... make a dream come true . - For who ? Williams ? Brower ? Is it Fillarri ? - It 's not Fillari . That piece of shit ain 't worth it . - I don 't care about this shit . Where 's the doctor ? Who was with you in the alleyway ? I saw them . - Pigs . Cops . - Sector one . You did a good job for him chasing me , Filtano . You made me work a little . - Why drag me ? - Drag ? It was an early birthday present for you . Brower had a heart on for your pops or something . It was political ! Expediency . We took on all those Anti-wall pussies . - It 's time for a little demo of this digestion . Fuck you . ? Where are we going ? You don 't make the plan you 're no use to me . - You see my scars , right ? You think this scares me ? - Hey , Roman , it 's Christine . What 's going on ? Roman ? - That 's her . - Roman ? - Come on . - Can you hear me ? - Let me help you . - Roman ? There you are . What 's going on out there ? Roman , why are we getting alarm alerts ? And why are you wearing - ? - Does that not seem a bit obvious to you ? I mean ... I mean , I 'm sure it would lead to a lot of questions using that route . - Don 't concern yourself with that . There will be plenty of questions after the fact . These will be the least problematic . However , I do think - Who is it ? I don 't know . I left instructions not to be disturned . Roman ? - What ? I told him never to come here . Well , let him in before somebody sees him . - Roman says hi , - What do you want ? - I just came to return my badge . Oh . Let me show you guys my new toy . Check this out . I 've got a ... Some lawyers . some ... uh ... city councilmen , and ... uh ... Nicholas Filtano ? And ... uh ... Valeri Konstov . - Yeah , that 's real cute . - Actually I haven 't even shown you the most interesting one . Now , the funny thing is , there 's none here for you , Christine . Do you want to do some digging around ? You know , do a little police work ? Here 's a map . - Aiden , wait ! You don 't need to leave your badge . We could really use your help in breaking this case . And I think a new position for you in the city . Detective ? - You know ... I think your men will continue to do a good job . You don 't need any help from second rate security guards . Now , if you guys excuse me , I gotta go home . - In recent days there 's been much talk and rumor about a breakdown of the very system which keeps our beloved city safe . The Helix . Now , I wanted to speak with you today to assure you that they are only rumors . That there 's been no significant breakdown . But what we have seen is simply an anomaly . The human error has once again neared its head . ? However , because of the hard work and diligence of our police force , headed by police chief Williams , the problem was discovered and dealt with so that it could never , ever happen again . Now , what I want you to remember as we move on from this better and safer world we were before.is that this was not a lapse .

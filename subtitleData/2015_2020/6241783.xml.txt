 [ narrator ] previously on dark matter . [ one ] we all woke up just like you , No memories , no idea who we are or how we got here . The crew of this ship is supposed to be dead , Definitely not supposed to be diseased cannibal monsters . [ six ] that 's a nasty gash . [ six ] she has all our memories in her head ! [ two ] she 's been having dreams .. Dreams she thinks might be memos Except that they 're not just he . [ two ] alpha-numeric lock code . [ one ] which none of us can remember . [ three ] you ever dream about the code , kid ? [ five ] no . [ three ] yeah but it 's still ratg around in your head , isn 't it ? [ man ] the emperor is dead ! [ woman ] you will pay for this . [ man ] find the prince ! Arrest him ! [ man ] hiding in the shadows like a rat . Take him . [ sword unsheathing ] [ sword slicing ] [ blood squirting ] [ men grunt in pain ] uuuggggh . [ sword falls to ground ] [ blood dripping ] drip ... Drip ... Drip [ sword slices through air ] [ five panting ] [ two ] something 's not right , it 's happening again . [ heart rate monitor beeping rap ] beep , beep , beep , beep [ two ] heart rate 's spiking . Brain wave activity is off the charts . She 's in trouble . [ five continues panting ] [ raza whooshes through space ] [ two ] there was a bit of a problem with the job . [ talbor ] what kind of a problem ? The ship was destroyed . Are you kidding me ? Wait , is this some kind of a sick joke ? To be more precise , we blew it up . You blew it up ? You blew the ship up ? ! That 's right . I imagine your client 's going to be angry . Oh yeah , i think , maybe ju-just a little . Angry enough to string you up , cut your heart out And show it to you while it 's still beating ? Because that 's what i 'm gonna do . Well- - Okay , that 's a whole lot of hostility coming out of nowhere . Given , you know , that i 'm the aggrieved party here . You lied to us . No , i never lied . You didn 't think it was worth mentioning That the far horizon was a plague ship ? That this was all about some failed attempts To create an immortality drug ? Okay , first of all , neglecting to mention Certain details is not the same as lying . Just wanna point that out . And secondly , if i 'd told you about the virus , You wouldn 't have taken the job . So ... Sue me . [ two ] i 'm not buying it . [ one ] what do you mean ? If he really wanted us to get that ship , He would 've warned us about the virus , So we could 've at least gone in prepared . [ six ] you 're saying he wanted us to fail ? [ two scoffs ] pfft Ferrous wants our heads , right ? Maybe they offered him something to take us out . [ four ] perhaps , he thought he could win either way . If we succeed , he gets the salvage . If we 're killed , ferrous pays him off . [ six ] you know what the real problem is ? Even if all this is true , He 's still the closest thing we have to a friend . [ one ] what 's our supply situation ? [ two ] bad , bordering on desperate . We 've got enough fuel to reach the outer colonies . There 's not much law out there , so we 'd probably be safe . But we don 't have enough food . We 'd have to go back in the stasis pods To even make it that far . [ three ] after what happened last time , not a chance . [ four ] and what would we do when we get there ? Find some work , if we 're lucky . If not ... Sell the ship . [ three ] which is what i have been saying from the start , Thank you very much . [ one ] you said you 'd never do that . Believe me , i don 't want to But i 'm starting to think that we may not have a choice . So , what 's up ? Well , technically this is none of my business , Although we are a small group of people forced to live In close quarters , so really it 's everyone 's business , but- - What are you talking about ? When three and i were on the freighter , it was , Kind of a life-or-death situation , And sometimes in those moments people say things , And they 're not necessarily- - You 're talking about the fact that Three and i slept together . Okay so , what 's the problem ? Obviously , you 're both adults , And you can do whatever you want , i just- - I-i found it a little surprising . Look , not that i have to explain myself to you , or- - No , hey- - Wait , shut up . I 'm not even exactly sure why i did it . I was restless and feeling lonely and He was just there . Okay . Sure . That 's it ? The thing is , with a guy like that you know there are Never going to be any complications . Right now , i don 't have room for complications . So you 're saying with someone else there might be- - Complications . Exactly . Yes . Okay . All right . Hey . Hey . You busy ? I 'm just going over some fuel consumption numbers . But uhh ... It can- - it can wait . Come in . You really think there might be treasure in that vault ? Well , until we can figure out a way to get in , There 's no way to know for sure . What if there is a way ? What are you talking about ? Well , i 've been checking out some of the equipment In the infirmary , you know how i like to fiddle . Anyway , with the android 's help , I think i might be able to adapt some of the medical equipment To work as a kind of mind probe . And who 's mind would we be probing ? Mine . I 've got all your memories in my head , i know it . But they 're jumbled up and they don 't make any sense . So , if i could just find a way- - No listen , this sounds way too dangerous . We 'll find another way to get into the vault . I don 't want to watch that happen . [ six ] are we sure this is right ? [ three ] if she wants to volunteer , let her volunteer . [ one ] oh , so now you wanna treat her like an adult ? Hey , i 'm not the one who gave her A vote in how things go around here . You can 't have it both ways . So how 's this gonna work ? [ android ] she 'll experience the hidden memories like a drea , Like she 's a passenger inside someone else 's body . All she has to do is observe , And remember as much as possible . [ one ] will it hurt ? [ android ] it shouldn 't . But i feel it necessary to point out that the equipment Is not designed to be used this way . [ five ] i know , i know . We 'll be monitoring your vital signs . If anything goes wrong , we 'll pull you out . I 'm ready . [ machine scanning ] ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ five breathing heavily ] [ male kendo instructor ] you must remember to always ground yours . Understand ? Good , that 's it . Again . [ shinai banging ] [ kenshi grunting ] Stop . Not like this . Like this . [ female kenshi ] yes , sir . [ male kendo instructor ] always watch your opponent . Do not look at his eyes but look at his feet , his hips . It will tell you where he 's moving . Understand , hmm ? Again . [ shinai banging ] [ kenshi grunting ] [ emperor ] ryo ! Why did you hesitate ? I won the point . There was no need to strike . What is it you think you 're learning here ? Swordsmanship , father . No . You 're learning discipline . [ emperor grunting ] [ shinai banging ] [ five as four panting ] You 're learning to respect our ways and traditions . When you are emperor , and your enemies find you vulnerable , Do you think they will hesitate ? [ shinai banging ] [ five as four whimpering ] [ shinai banging ] [ both grunting ] [ five as four panting ] [ five panting ] [ computer alarms ringing ] [ two ] something 's not right . Brain-wave activity is all over the place . Pull her out . [ five panting ] [ five gasping ] [ five panting ] What happened ? [ two ] we shut it down . Why ? Because i don 't want you to have a stroke , that 's why . Hey , this was a bad idea . [ four grunting ] [ sword whipping ] It was one of your memories- - That 's what i was experiencing When they pulled me out , i 'm sure of it . You were younger , maybe 12 or 13 . You were sparring with another boy . You went easy on him , and your father- - Well , he wasn 't very happy . I see . Sorry , i wish i could 've seen more , something useful . You need to learn control . I don 't know how , the memories they 're random . No , you need to learn to control yourself . Look , you 're a smart girl , but you have an undisciplined m . You need to learn to observe without emotion . That 's not so easy . Some of the memories they 're pretty ... Intense . Yeah , but they 're nothing but recordings of past events . They can 't be changed , So an emotional reaction serves no purpose . Two , this is five . Go ahead . I want to try again . Please . Are you sure about this ? I can handle it this time , now that i know what to expect . Okay . Good luck . [ machine scanning ] ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ five as four ] brother , what is this ? Where are they taking your things ? Where do you think ? The ship leaves tonight . What ship ? You remember when you made this for me ? That time we went to the beach ? I couldn 't have been more than 6 or 7 years old . I remember . It 's funny to think that i kept it all these years . I don 't understand . I do . It makes perfect sense . Father 's getting old , and it 's dangerous to have more Than one heir to the throne living in the palace . It gives people ideas . What did he do ? [ four 's step-mother ] don 't play innocent . It 's bad enough you 've had my son banished off world . Don 't make it worse by insulting his intelligence . I-i 've had him banished ? Your seal was on the royal proclamation . This was father 's doing . He wants people to fear me . He thinks it 's the only way i can rule . You have used that excuse for every cruelty you 've visited On your brother for the last 10 years . Maybe you have yourself convinced . But the rest of us know better . Brother . Please . Goodbye . ¶ dramatic music ¶ [ ship whirring ] [ akita ] my lord , i 've been looking for you . Out of my way , akita-san . I need to speak to our glorious emperor . Maybe you should wait until You 're in a better frame of mind . You dare disobey me ? [ sword unsheaths ] I 'm not your student anymore . And i 'm not afraid of him . As you wish , denka . In bed already , father ? Having another one of your spells ? Why don 't you just get it over with ... Die already ? I know what you did . It wasn 't enough just to be cruel . You had to do it in my name . You want me to be an emperor like you . But i will never be like you . Do you hear me ? [ four as five panting ] [ four 's step-mom ] well , well , what do we have her ? You 're going to pay for this . You did this ? ! I am the emperor 's beloved wife and you are his cruel , Vindictive son who unjustly banished his own half brother , And who 's been seen staggering about the palace drunk , Cursing the emperor 's name . Who do you think they 're going to believe ? My son will be emperor , and you will be dead . [ akita yelling ] the emperor is dead ! Find the prince ! Arrest him ! Hiding in the shadows like a rat . Take him . [ sword unsheathing ] [ sword slicing ] [ blood squirting ] [ sword falls to ground ] [ blood dripping ] drip ... Drip ... Drip [ sword slices through air ] [ five panting ] [ two ] it 's happening again . Heart rate 's spiking . Brain activity is off the chart . She 's in trouble . Shut it down , pull her out . Understood . [ five panting and whimpering ] Five , wake up . Five ! Wake up ! Five , can you hear me ? What 's happening ? Evidently , the dream state persists , Even without the aid of a mind probe . Five , can you hear me ? Five ! [ five panting and whimpering ] [ one ] what about a shot of adrenaline ? That should wake her up ? [ one ] it could but with her bran activity already elevated , It could make matters worse . This is not ordinary rem sleep . For all intents and purposes , her brain is functioning On a conscious level , but the dream elements Have replaced normal sensory input . [ six ] but she knows she 's dreaming , right ? She should have full memory of everything That happened before she went in . [ two ] her readings are stabilizing . She 's calmed down . Maybe she 's learning to control , like she said she would . [ distant chatter ] [ man grunts ] Sorry . ¶ intense music playing ¶ ¶ intense music playing ¶ ¶ intense music playing ¶ [ buzzer beeps ] [ door slides open ] Guys , guess who just scored . Dinner 's on me tonight . What the hell ? ¶ suspenseful music ¶ ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ man ] das . T.J. ? What 's going on ? Are you all right ? I 've been shot . Oh my god . It 's okay . I don 't think it hit anything vital . I just have to keep pressure on it to stop the bleeding . We have to get you to a doctor . No , no doctors . They 'd find us . Who ? What is this ? You remember that guy you picked yesterday ? What , the guy with the beard ? Yeah , well , that was no ordinary mark . He was- - he was connected . We didn 't have anything just what looked Like some weird data storage device . I couldn 't even read it . I need some water or something . Umm . Here . It wasn 't a data storage device it was some kind of key . You mean this thing ? I was gonna see if i could sell it in the market for a few bars . I think it 's worth a lot more than that . They want it back pretty bad . Who 's they ? Some guys came around , asking questions . Someone must 've tipped them off Cause we didn 't even see them coming . T.J. Where are the others ? ¶ suspenseful music ¶ They 're dead . They killed them . [ five gasping ] [ five crying ] [ five panting ] We have to get out of here . We have to get on a ship . We don 't have any money . It 's not enough . It 's enough for one . You could get as far as acamar . No , i 'm not leaving you . I was in a coffee shop this morning , casing another mark , I-i overheard two guys talking . So ? We need to get to cargo bay 4 , now . It 's our only chance . [ three ] please tell me this is the last one . [ one ] it 's the last one . You 're not just saying that are ya ? All right , we are outta here . T.J. ? Where are you ? [ banging ] [ t.J. ] i 'm stuck . Hold on . We need to find a good place to hide . They 're gonna notice if i bleed all over the freeze dried food . I 've got an idea . [ five ] are you okay ? This isn 't looking so good . I 'll be fine . Look , i heard the engines kick in a few minutes ago . We 're probably already in ftl . So ? I-i 'll find the crew , and come clean ? I 'll tell them we 're here , and ask for their help . Are you crazy ? They 're already under way . They 've probably got a schedule to keep . They 're not gonna turn around and go back Just for a couple of stowaways . Why would they , when they could just shove us out an airlock ? Do you really think they 'd do that ? You wanna take a chance they won 't ? All right , you win . Where are you going ? There 's gotta be a sick bay on this tub somewhere . I 'll sneak out , see if i can find some supplies , So we can sew you up good . Then we wait it out . Okay . Be careful . We 're gonna be fine . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ one ] so , who the hell is ms . Maplethorpe , anyway ? [ six ] uhh , she was a teacher i had when i was a kid . It 's as good a code as any . I know i 'll never forget it . She used to hit me on the knuckles with a ruler . [ hatch squeaks open ] [ two ] what is it ? [ android ] we have a problem . What ? Her autonomic functions are receiving diminished Input from her hypothalamus . [ six ] what the hell does that mean ? Her organs are shutting down . If we don 't find a way to pull her out- - She 's won 't make it . [ raza whirring ] [ android ] her mind is still functioning , But it 's receiving and processig only imaginary inputs From the dream scenarios . Her brain is losing contact with her body . And without the brain , the body dies . Precisely . We could put her in stasis , that would keep her alive . I don 't think that 's a good idea . She 's lost in the memories . She 's gone too deep , am i right ? It 's possible . [ four ] then the longer she stays in there , the worse i . We have to get her out now , or we never will . How ? Someone has to go in there and get her . Is that even possible ? Effectively , yes . [ one and two ] i 'll do it . [ six ] no . I 'll go . And i 'm not arguing . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ five panting ] ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ five panting ] ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ five panting ] [ three ] well , well , well what do we have here ? Looks like a stowaway , maybe a thief . A junkie ? I 'm not a junkie . Then why the meds , hmm ? What 's the matter , can 't talk ? Ah , don 't worry about it , There 's no sound where you 're going anyway . [ five ] you can 't do this ! [ three ] sure i can , i 'm barely breaking a sweat here . What about the rest of your crew ? What about them ? Well maybe they 'd object to throwing a girl out the airlock ! You don 't know the rest of my crew . [ door beeping ] Wait , wait i have something . Something valuable . Really ? It 's a key . I-i 'm not exactly sure what for , but the guy i stole it from Killed all my friends trying to get it back , So it must be worth something , right ? It 's hidden somewhere on this ship . You 'll never find it without my help . Hmm . I can live with that . Please , no , no . [ five ] no , please , please . [ five pounding on door ] don 't do this ! [ android ] because you 'll experie the memories through her percep , They won 't seem like your own , the way they do for her . You 'll feel more like an outside observer . For that reason , i don 't think there 's any chance of you Losing yourself , the way she did . [ six ] that 's good to know . Of course , it 's just a theory . Thanks . How will he find her ? She 's got a lifetime of memories crammed inside that head . That 's a lot of ground to cover . I can do my best to sync your brain pattern to hers . That should get you close . But you 'll still have to will yourself in and out Of each memory you encounter until you find her . Sounds like a piece of cake . [ two ] you can do this . You 'll find her , and you 'll bring her back . I know it . Okay . Fire it up . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ men laughing ] [ six groans ] [ past six ] woo , the look on that guy 's face . I still can 't believe we got away with it . There 's only one possible explanation , we 're the best ! [ men laughing ] Well , i 'll be damned . It 's one of mine . [ laughing continues ] [ past six ] there she is . Take a look , boys . We arrived at the station in a shuttle , we left in that . No , that 's what i call trading up ! No one 's ever stolen a galactic authority destroyer . This is gonna change everything . You 're damn right . Now let 's get a drink ! [ man ] brothers , welcome back ! The general himself wanted to be here to congratulate you , But he had to return to arrakis sadr To coordinate our next campaign . [ clears throat ] A toast . To the insurrection ! [ all ] the insurrection ! Has word got out , do people know what we did ? Are you kidding ? G.A. ' s won 't let this get out , it 's too embarrassing . Any news station that tries to broadcast this , They 'll get shut down before they can even finish the report . [ past six ] no , this is way too big . There 's no way they can keep this quiet . People everywhere are gonna hear about this , and you know what ? They 're gonna be inspired . They 're gonna to realize The galactic authority isn 't invincible . They 're going to open their eyes to the corruption Of the corporate system , and they 're going to start figh . This is just the beginning . Well said , brother . [ cups clink ] [ man ] you bastard . How could you do this ? [ six ] caleb , what 's wrong ? Why didn 't you tell us ? [ past six ] what 's he talking about ? See for yourself . It 's all over the net . [ news anchor ] in a stunning escalation Of their terror campaign , members of the so-called Procyon insurrection have attacked and destroyed A space station in the hyadum sector . The exact death-toll is as yet unknown , But it 's estimated as many as ten thousand people Were onboard when the station was bombed . The perpetrators are believed to have escaped On a stolen galactic authority destroyer . [ past six ] what ? This is a- - this is a mistake . [ news anchor ] commodore tarvas of the galactiy Issued this statement earlier t . [ tarvas ] these so-called rebels have once again shown themselves To be nothing more than depraved thugs , With no respect for law , order , or human decency . And i promise everyone here today , And everyone watching in the far-flung corners of the ga , They will be brought to justice . [ past six ] i-i don 't understand . We didn 't attack that station , there was no bomb . The shuttle you left in the hangar bay was rigged To blow the minute you jumped to ftl in the destroyer . What ? ! Why- - why would you do that ? W-we had the ship , we got away , that was the mission ! The mission was to make a statement . The mission was to serve notice and that 's exactly what we did . The general would never have agreed to this . Who do you think came up with the plan in the first place ? We just ... Murdered ten thousand innocent civilians . Those people sold themselves and their families To the corporations a long time ago . No one who participates in that corrupt And decadent lifestyle can claim innocence . [ past six vomits ] I thought you were made of stronger stuff than that . Man up ! [ gunshots ] [ six ] this isn 't right . It has to be a mistake . It has to be . [ gun clicks ] [ past six ] argh ! Enough . That 's enough . [ five ] i 'm back ! [ woman ] hey , hi . You 're just in time , i was about to go make some soup . [ five ] that sounds great . Jonesy 's still a little lame in her left foreleg . Okay well , your father will be home tomorrow And he can take a look at it . And it 's his birthday coming up , So should we make him something special ? Elderberry pie ? I thought elderberry pie was your favorite , not his . Are you sure about that ? Okay , elderberry pie it is . Mwah ! I 'll see you in the kitchen when you 're done , okay ? Okay . [ birds chirping ] [ five ] what are you doing here ? [ six ] you can see me ? Of course i can see you . And i know you 're not supposed to be here . Whose memory is this , anyway ? Well they call me titch for what that 's worth But i 'm pretty sure it 's one 's . I see a boy 's face in the mirror every morning . It doesn 't look all that much like him But the only other possibility is three , And i kinda doubt he grew up in a place like this . Yeah , i know what you mean . It 's nice . It 's better than nice . He 's got two parents who love him , they 've got a farm , Animals , food on the table , it 's perfect . How long have you been here ? I 've lost track . It was summer when i came , it 's winter now . Every day i go skating on the pond . You 've been on the table less than two hours . Well , i guess time works a little different here . You know it 's not real , right ? I thought we 'd lost you Thought you 'd forgotten these were only memories . Sometimes i do forget . You have to come back with me . Your body is dying . Your mind 's gone , and without it- - Just put me in stasis , i 'll be fine . Why , so you can stay here ? It 's not even your memory . I saw some of my own memories , no thanks . Yeah , well , that much i can understand . Then let me stay . Look , i admit , out there in the real world We 've got our problems . Maybe that 's an understatement . But in here you 've got no control , You 're just along for the ride . That 's exactly what i like about it . I don 't have to think , i don 't have to worry . But it can 't last . Because as nice as all this is , there 's a storm cloud coming And you know it . Whoever grew up here didn 't wind up on that ship Without something happening to them , something bad . Maybe the dad comes home drunk one day and murders the mom . Maybe terrorists show up and set off a bomb . Who knows ? But it happened to me , and it happened to you And it 'll happen to him . Maybe it all ends badly out there in the real world too , But then again , maybe not . In here we can 't change anything , Out there , we can at least try . He 's back ! Where is she , did you find her ? [ five gasps ] We thought we 'd lost you there . How are you feeling ? Okay i guess . Do you know where you are ? Back on the ship . Guess there 's no place like home . [ sword whipping ] I saw some more of your memories . I know what happened to you , i know where you 're from . I already know . You do ? I found a royal signet ring among my things . I did some research . Turns out , i was a prince . Heir to the throne of ishida , until i murdered my own father . No ! No you didn 't . You didn 't kill him . What are you talking about ? I was there , i saw it . You found his body , but he was already dead . It was the empress . She wanted her own son to rule , your half brother . The empress . I saw some of what you had to do To get out of there alive and it wasn 't pretty . Who knows what you had to do to survive after that But the point is , it wasn 't your fault . And now that you know , you can put it behind you , righ ? You don 't have to be that person anymore . Right ? [ knocking ] Come in . I wanted to thank you for coming to get me . You 're welcome . You should know one and two also volunteered . Not three ? [ six chuckles ] You know , it 's one of the reasons Why i didn 't want to come back . I never felt like i knew who to trust out here . I mean , i thought i could trust two , But sometimes she scares me a little . Yeah , join the club . But now , at least , i know i can trust you . Goodnight . Goodnight . [ beeping ] [ door slides shut ] [ news anchor ] this is believed o be the only known recorded image Of the mastermind behind the bombing Of station hyadum twelve , Known to his followers as simply " the general . " Although he 's the subject of an intense manhunt By the galactic authority , his current whereabouts remain .

 Peter : Previously on helix ... Caleb : Do you know the way to san jose ? I don 't understand . You 're not gonna die on me , are you ? I 'm already dying . Txm-7 . I thought you were ... Immortal . Not indestructible . ( julia gasps ) I guess the sword works . Peter : There 's no going back now . Anne : What has the world outside ever given to you ? Nothing . I wanted to be a healer . You look nervous , olivia . ( grunts ) ( neck breaks ) Why did he kill my mom ? ( sobs ) now i 'm alone . I 'll be your family now . Why don 't you come with me ? I can 't . I have to finish what i started . ( coughs and gasps ) I still gotta turn you in . First bank of atlanta . Safety deposit box 274 . Sarah : The mother tree . Michael must have had some way to access its roots . Anne : That thing is not a child . Shut up . And keeping it like that is cruel ... ( screaming ) You are my son , my family . Sister amy : They became pure vessels . Release them . All of them . It 's mother . She 's everywhere . Julia : We can create widespread infertility without any mycotic effect . You have to let me go . I can 't . ( gun cocks ) ( gun shot ) ( alan panting ) Alan : You shot me ! Julia : Well , you were gonna shoot me . ( moaning ) Stay with me , alan , okay ? ( grunts ) Stay with me , alan . All right ? You have a son now . You think about that . You 're gonna pull through this . Think about that . ( door opens ) No sign of that lunatic peter . Thinking he 's crazy is your first mistake . What do you call firing at a us navy helicopter ? Aggressive . They 're gonna think twice about a second evac . We gotta keep trying . There 's no telling how far the mycosis has spread . Mayday , mayday , this is dr . Kyle sommer with the cdc . We have the cure for mycosis . I repeat , we have the cure . Kyle , we need to be smart about this . We have to find another way Off this island . The longer we wait , the higher the rate of infection . If one of those ships gets to the mainland ... We need as much of the cure as you can carry . Can you handle that ? Absolutely . Where you going ? To make a deal with the devil . ( woman screaming ) What have you done ? Save amy . For what ? To look like this ? ( sobbing ) Look at the two of us . What a pair we make . We 're absolutely hideous . Beautiful . I 'm not beautiful anymore . You know what i am , landry ? Free . Free to do whatever i want To whoever i want . And right now ... I 'd like to thank My immortal sisters For my new face . ( theme music playing ) ( baby cooing ) Two parts cannabis indica . One part capsaicin . When it came to pain management , my mother was a genius . Someone has desecrated the council hall . One of the others saw jerome ... Thank you , carson . I thought it was a fool 's errand , But an outsider found what 's been beneath our feet for centuries . The mother tree ? What remains of her , anyway . Eli , her roots may still be viable . How does that help us ? Dr. Walker said ilaria wants mother . Why shouldn 't you Be the one to deliver it ? Yes ... We can bypass the navy and cdc . I 'm sure They 'll pay handsomely . It 's not just about money . Ilaria has power and influence . Anne , you and i are gonna be Heard around the world . Those 200 followers ... Imagine two million . I would follow you anywhere . I need to get underneath the tree and access the roots . There are blocked stairways behind the council hall . We were always told they were dead ends . Another one of michael 's lies . For us , i 'll always find a way . Kyle : Hey , buddy , why don 't you rest for a bit ? If i gave this much blood , you 'd have to scrape me off the floor . I 'm fine . When we get back , first thing i wanna do is order a pizza From fellini 's . Thin crust , sausage And mushroom . Two pizzas , one for each of us . Then ... Glorious sleep for a week straight . That 's a long time . We 'll take breaks , of course . Gotta make time for playstation . What 's that ? You mean you 've never played call of duty 4 ? Aw man , you are in for a treat . Hey ... I know we were real close to getting out of here . I 'm disappointed too . But nothing 's gonna stop us from going home . Us , maybe . But not my mom . I know , soren . I wish things were different . It 's not fair . Peter killed my mom . Someone should kill him too . Whoa , hold on , now . It may not be perfect or fair , But there 's a system in place To punish people like peter . And i promise you i 'll do whatever i have to . Peter is never gonna hurt you or anybody else again . ( lights flicker ) ( sighing ) now what ? Let me find a flashlight . ( door opens ) Soren ? Come back here ! Soren ! ( coughing ) How long have i been here ? Five days . It 's strange how the tables have turned . How 's that ? I was here 30 years ago . But i wasn 't the one in this bed . It was alan . What happened ? ( inhales ) I shot him . That doesn 't make any sense . ( chuckles ) Love rarely does . I haven 't completely been honest . Thirty years ago , i was here too . You 've killed my mom ! ( screaming ) ( grunts ) Soren , you really shouldn 't have done that ! Julia : What do you mean you were here 30 years ago ? Who are you ? At least tell me why you stole my father 's sword . ( julia grunts ) Julia : You know what it means , don 't you ? I can read it . It 's a string of letters . Dozens of them . C-a-c-g-u-c - A-c-l ... That 's an rna code . Each letter stands for a nucleotide . It 's a recipe for a virus . Like txm-7 . But he said it was his legacy . Why would my father create a virus to kill immortals When all he ever wanted to do is spread immortality ? Maybe someone changed his mind . Goddammit , caleb , i 'm dying ! I don 't have time for games , just tell me ! I wanna tell you everything . First you have to answer one question . Do you know the way to san jose ? What ... ( bells ringing ) ( creaking sound ) Carson ? ( door opens ) ( baby cooing ) Hello , mother . What ? Is something the matter ? Amy , your face ... You 're hurt . Since when do you care how i feel ? Of course i care . You 're my daughter . Oh , really ? You didn 't seem To care that much when i begged you not to let my father have me . I couldn 't admit i was wrong about michael , Because that would mean my entire life Was a lie . I told myself laying with him was a privilege . But it was no honor . It was abuse . So deeply rooted That i accepted it like the air we breathe . I am so sorry , amy ... Amy : No ! No , no , No , no ! You don 't get to do this ! Not now . It 's too late . Look at me . ( sniffles ) Look at me ! Look at me ! ( sobs ) There 's still hope for us . Oh no , mother . There 's no hope . And no amount of distance will allow us to escape what we are . You may not look like us , But inside ... You 're a monster . A freak . Just like me . Please , give me another chance . You don 't deserve another chance . And i won 't allow you one . ( baby cooing ) The baby . No . Give me the baby . No . I won 't let you make him like me ! No ! If you follow us , i 'll make sure He never cries again . ( baby crying ) Goodbye , mother . ( sobbing ) Constructive symbiosis . The union of two species In a single body . That 's mother . The root is the host , But the fungus causes the infertility . Luckily , she 's also disjunctive . She doesn 't need the root for survival . She can survive in any genetic environment . You should really stop talking . I barely had enough thread to suture the wound . Jules ... I said no talking . You can 't give mother to ilaria . We can control it . Like michael ? Mycosis spreading through bees ... Even ilaria can 't control nature . Can 't you see that i don 't have a choice ? You do . You do , you have a choice . You know what i have ? I have less than 12 hours to stop the release of narvik . ( sighs ) what happened now ? She shot me . And he 's still talking . I don 't wanna get in the middle of this . Can i have a minute ? Look , i know you need to get back to paris as soon as you can and i wanna know If that job offer still stands . Yeah . Yeah , of course it does . I need to get my son off this island , along with the rest of my team . Okay , done . Look , joining us at ilaria 's in the best interest for you and the baby , okay ? Where did alan go ? I don 't know , but he has mother . This will do nicely . Give it to me . He 's my ... Friend . Friend ? You , you think it likes you ? Let me show you how much . ( crying ) Cry really loud so all the sisters Can hear you . Good baby . You have no friends . ( baby crying ) Julia . Alan is here . We 're running out of time . If we don 't find ... We will . What if we don 't ? He has mother , he has a sat phone ... I should 've just let him bleed out . Maybe you should 've . I know it sounds callous , but he put himself in this position . Let just focus on finding him . And then what ? Are you prepared to kill him ? Because he 's not gonna stop . His hatred for immortals , he 's obsessed . It can 't help you and i being what we are . It 's not our fault . You know , for the past year i 've been jumping into every hot zone i can find . You 've probably done a lot of good . I wish it was that . Truth is , If i stopped to think about what all this means , i 'd lose my mind . ( baby crying ) Did you hear that ? Yeah . ( crying ) Sarah : Oh , my god . Who would leave a baby like this ? I don 't know . Shh ... Let 's just take it and go . ( hissing ) Julia : Sarah , they want the baby . No , no , no ! Be careful with that ! No , don 't ! Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Alan could be bleeding to death . We don 't have time for this . Trust me . Please , please ... Please , he 's my son . Amy ripped my baby out of me . And i 'm guessing that she was responsible for what happened to you . ( hissing ) But please don 't hurt him because of what she did . Thank you . Soren ? Where have you been ? I 've been looking all over for you . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . What were you thinking ? You had me worried sick . I 'm sorry . I was just following my path . ( scoffs ) From now on , i need to know where your path goes at all times . Look , this is kind of new for both of us , So we gotta figure it out together . It 's just , No one ever cared where i went before . All right , let 's get back to work . Okay . ( gun clicking ) drop the can . Do you even know how to operate that thing ? I don 't need to . ( yelp ) ( groaning ) Is that all you got ? Two weeks ago , I would have had a completely different answer to that question . You know , i should be thanking you . When you left me down there in that hole , I thought it was the end . ( chuckles ) But it was just the beginning . See , that 's the thing about Hitting rock bottom . It gives you a lot of time to reassess what 's really important . ( grunts ) not so fast . ( moaning ) You know , I used to think that i ... I didn 't deserve to be happy . That i 'd never Really find love , get married , Have children . ( groans ) But i 've learned That family is not what you 're born with , It 's what you choose . Family Stands by you no matter what . Unconditionally . That is why ... I know , alan That you Are not my family . You really mean it ? Sure do . Whoever makes the cure gets to name it . But didn 't alan make it ? I 'm sure he wouldn 't mind if we named it after you . How about , uh ... Sorenol ? How about ... Olivia ? I think that 's a great idea . Smell that ? ( sniffing ) Yeah . Smells like smoke . ( fire crackling ) Man : ( on radio ) nature green , this is the uss independence . We have a visual . Fire on ground . Do you copy ? Heck yeah , we copy . Standing by with the cure . Be advised We 're sending in another chopper . Evac at 0400 . Over . We gotta go find dr . Jordan . I 'm not letting you out of my sight . Come on . Sarah : We need to get out of here . Not until i get my bag back , and mother . How are you gonna do that ? You have no idea where alan is . I do now . Who do you think started that fire ? He 's trying to destroy mother . Come on . No , julia , i can 't . What ? I have to get my child to safety . Okay , i 'll meet you outside . ( amy laughing ) Dr. Walker ? Dr. Jordan ... ( laughing ) I can 't wait to see What the ladies have done to you . ( laughing ) ( hissing ) What are you doing ? Let go ! Let go ! Let go of me ! No ! No ! ( screaming ) Landry ! Landry ! ( sobbing ) landry ... Help me ! Landry ! Landry ! Help ! Help ! No ! Landry ! Landry ! ( screaming ) No ! No ! No ! ( screaming ) ( coughing ) Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! ( alan coughing ) Jules ! Alan ! Alan ! Where 's my bag ? Where 's mother ? Peter ... Okay , come on . ( coughing ) Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Peter : I 'm going back for our baby . No , eli . It 's too late . I 'm his father . I have to try . Please , don 't do this . I can 't lose both of you . I told you . I 'll find a way . Kyle : Sarah ! Sarah ! You oughta keep that kid on a tighter leash . That little shit stabbed me . Someone needs to teach him some manners . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Is that true ? Did you stab him ? Don 't ever do that again . ( grunts ) Don 't ever do that either . About time someone did that . Let 's go . Landry , stop . Where are you going ? ( helicopter approaching ) Home . ( helicopter whirring ) Come on , julia , where are you ? Caleb : Before i show you something . Do you know the way to san jose ? Oh ... ( chuckles ) Yes , i do . ( breathing heavily ) Julia : We were running late on our way up north , To where alan 's family was . We blew a tire on the 101 . ( chuckles ) the car swerved across four lanes of traffic . We got a tow to a repair shop In san jose . City hall was just down the street , and in the time it took to patch the tire , We got married . And i 'll never forget what he said . Your love is gonna kill me . I do know the way to san jose . ( breath trembling ) who are you ? ( helicopter blades whirring ) Soren ? I haven 't heard that name for a long time .

 Previously on Defiance ... I don 't believe Rahm Tak will ever release Alak alive . A fully functional Omec warship could destroy the entire Votanis Collective . T 'Evgin needs to die . So long as that madman has the power to expose us , we must obey his commands . Is that poison ? I 'll fill a hidden needle and inject the Omec during coitus . Why do you want me dead ? Actually , I don 't . I need to know I can count on you . You had him . And if you hadn 't have choked , Rahm Tak could be a cooling corpse right now , and Defiance would be a whole lot safer . You 're benched . You 're gonna stay here with Berlin , you 're gonna figure out who planted those explosives . I 'm the lawkeeper now . Ah ! Whatever 's inside this man 's head is killing him . Ripped By mstoll It doesn 't look broken . It 'll be fine . Here , this will help soak up the blood . Thanks . Oh , gross , gross , gross . - Is it working ? - Pretty much . Did you hit him back ? Are you kidding ? What is wrong with you ? He 's the biggest kid in the yard . I hit back , he hits me twice . It 's safer just to fall down . I didn 't raise you to be a doormat . Oh , so you raised me ? Don 't tell Mom and Dad . Look . It 's the aliens ! Get away from the window ! It 's okay , Jon Stewart says they 're friendly . Watch out ! She 's got it . Josh , help me put this stuff back where it was . How did you know ? 'Cause that 's my sister , Rebecca . And that little boy is me . Just put the stuff anywhere . Where are we ? It needs to go back where it was . You know how OCD Mom gets . How long has he been like this ? Hour , hour and a half . We stopped to refuel and he just collapsed . We need to sedate him . Top drawer behind you . You got some moves , kid . You a doctor ? I 'll take it . There 's a crash cart behind you . Grab it in case we need to defibrillate . I 'm on it . What 's wrong with him ? But we 're losing him . Do you think we 're dead ? I don 't feel dead . No . This is something else . You never said you had a sister . Rebecca ? Josh , you gotta be careful with those rounds . They 're explosive tipped . I know what I 'm doing . I trained on the T-Nines . Hey . Look at me . Focus . You 're scared and you 'd piss yourself if you weren 't so exhausted . So am I. But Cooper 's unit 's coming through here tomorrow and they 're gonna need this ammo we 're guarding . Okay ? Hey , those were empty coffins at Mom and Dad 's funerals . Why ? They were vaporized , and we lost our parents . I want payback , don 't you ? Yeah . Yes . We 're Nolans . We have one rule . We live together ... Or we die together . Good man . They 're getting on the roof ! I remember this . No ! I got incoming . Take out the I-rath ! Please , I don 't want to fight anymore . No more fight . C 'mon , Josh . Waste him and get over here ! Listen to her ! Shoot him ! Please . Death to the sutso ! You 're all right . You 're gonna be okay . You have to hold the position . Everyone 's counting on us . And whatever you do , don 't ... Don 't ... Tell me . I won 't . I won 't . I promise I won 't . What ... One single task ! Kill the Omec ! I poisoned him with enough ZWIM-bo to kill a bell beast . But is the Omec dead ? No . He 's at home , smelling my wife on his fingers and chuckling about how he cuckolded Datak Tarr ! I doubt T 'Evgin knows your name . " Incompetence " is not a word I normally associate with you . Or perhaps there 's something deeper going on here ? Deeper ? What 's that supposed to mean ? Now look what you 've done . You 've woken the baby . Hello , wee one . Aw ! Grandma Stahma loves purple-enchanter penis so much she 's forgotten all about your daddy Alak . That 's beneath you . And now Grandpa Datak has to go out and put a bullet in the enchanter 's brain ... to compensate for Grandma 's embarrassing female weakness . Have you quite finished ? Was there more you wanted to say ? Shooting the Omec is a stupid plan . Why is that ? I learned that Omec become stronger as they age . T 'Evgin is much , much , older than he appears . I doubt a sniper bullet will do more than irritate him . I 'm happy to put that theory to a test . An irritated Omec is likely to hunt you down , hang you from your ankles and separate you from your spinal column . I 'd like to see him try . As would I. But it won 't help Alak . How does any of this help Alak ? Rahm Tak is Casti . He was raised on the same old enchanter stories we were . He fears T 'Evgin , which is why he ordered us to kill him . If I can get T 'Evgin on our side , we can exploit that fear to secure Alak 's release . And why would T 'Evgin help us ? Must I draw you a chart ? Contrary to what you think , darling , your chivo is not magic . On many occasions you 've said different . You have to trust me . Of course . Always . Nobody said stop . The gun seller has arrived . Finally . Welcome . Your reputation precedes you , of course . I am General Rahm Tak of the Votanis Collective . These are Lieutenants Bebe , Geeze . Pleasure . Please , join me for some wine . Long trip . Back to work . Yes , Boss . How bad is it ? He needs a machine to breath and I 'm keeping his heart beating with drugs . And he 's not responding to painful stimuli . Essentially , he 's brain dead . Is this true ? It seems that way . You 're asking Dr. Dolittle ? Suddenly my word not good enough ? I just want to make sure everything possible is being done to save his life . Wait , what 's going on ? Amanda 's afraid that I might try to kill Nolan . Why the hell would you do that ? Because a couple weeks ago , the two of them held me down and skinned me alive ? C 'mon . You 're kidding , right ? That didn 't happen . You 're hazing me , right ? Welcome to the suck , jarhead . Whoa ! Hang on . Look at this . Brain activity . Out of nowhere . And it 's not human . There 's a mass in Nolan 's medial temporal lobe . I think it 's arktech . How is that possible ? It 's got to be from the sleeper pod that he shared with Irisa . She 's got a scar just like this . I 've got a theory . Get Irisa in here . Yeah , well , I don 't know where she is . Well , if you want a shot at saving Nolan , find her ! Now ! Hey . Have you seen Irisa ? We 're not exactly soul sisters these days . Well , we have to find her or Nolan 's gonna die . Shtak , shtak , shtak . Where did you go ? Help me . How did you know ? I 'm sorry about Rebecca . I don 't want to talk about it . She seemed like she really ... I said I don 't want to talk about it . It should have been me that died . Don 't say that . She shouldn 't have even been there . I thought the war would help me prove something . Make me a man , or something romantic like that . And then I got there , the reality was anything but romantic , noble or even good . Becca knew it would be like that . So she enlisted , she made sure she was assigned to my unit so she could protect me . She was brave . She didn 't care what anyone else thought . She 's the type of girl who 'd rather be under a car fixing it than in the backseat with a guy . All her friends loved Taylor Swift , but she lived for Johnny Cash . There was nothing about her I didn 't want to be . If I had been stronger , she 'd be alive . It 's been exactly one year since the fateful night that turned the tide of the Pale Wars . The night ' when every alien ship all over the world exploded . Many crashed to Earth ... When are we ? This is the shaming rack . A Storm Divide watering hole . Making space travel an impossibility . The majority of the wreckage remained in orbit and were dubbed the Arkbelt . The tragic event could not have come at a more opportune time for the Earth Military Coalition . Since they were in danger of losing the war one year ago . This is the one-year anniversary of Arkfall . Every human I knew got plastered this night . We spoke to EMC ambassador Olfin Tennety . And here 's what she had to say . Over the last year , one thing has become clear . We have broken the back of the Votanis Collective . They are no longer capable of maintaining their war effort and this has forced them to the bargaining table . War is over ! Yeah ! To quote a great Earth leader , " Peace is at hand . " But not soon enough for this guy , huh ? Too true . I miss you on the front lines , No-Man . How you been paying the bills ? You know how some of that ark wreckage still falls from space to Earth ? This guy Varus pays top dollar for arktech . So you 're one of those scavenger guys , with a little girl in tow ? The official term is arkhunter , my friend , and the kid loves it . Right , she can climb into all the tiny spaces I can 't reach . Watch out folks , father of the year coming through , huh ? Hey , I 'm not her dad . I just helped her out of a bad situation . Arkfall . I gotta go . I 'll settle up . You got the last one , J-Turk . I got this one . Earth is for humans ! See you , brother . I have no memory of this night . Did it really happen ? - Kiddo ... - Don 't Kiddo me ! Did it happen ? It was a different time . Hmm . Well , the daily special seems to be scrambled brains . What ? There 's an arktech cluster in Irisa 's head , just like Nolan 's . And you want to know the kicker ? The minute you brought her in here , both their vitals stabilized . And Nolan 's breathing on his own . That 's good , right ? That means they 're getting better . Actually , it 's bad . Very bad . Votan sleeper pods were not designed for humans . Sharing one forced the pod to make some modifications to keep it from killing Nolan . What modifications ? The pod physically tethered Nolan and Irisa 's brains . It kept them both alive , but the brains grew interdependent , like organs on conjoined human twins . Right . Both twins can survive , so long as they remain attached . Exactly . The Omec severed the attachment when it took Nolan and Irisa out of the pod . Now the arktech adapted itself , keeping the connection going through a spread-spectrum signal . Like Bluetooth ? You 're adorable . But sure , why not , let 's call it " Bluetooth for the brain . " When you and Nolan left town , the connection broke . But instead of a dropped signal , they got brain damage . Bringing them closer together reestablished the link and stabilized their conditions . But unfortunately it is temporary . The arktech is growing out of control . What can we do to save their lives ? Well , I need to open them up and cut the arktech out . Well , you 've done this surgery before , right ? Best not to dwell on that . My hands are freezing . I can barely hold the ax . Just give me a second to warm them . On your feet . Let 's go . Just give me a second to warm them , man . Bebe ! Geeze ! Let 's start unloading these crates . Favi Tak , good news with our guest ? Oh , he won 't stop talking , or drinking my wine . Right now , he and his Bio-men are subjecting the men to old-earth show tunes . He 's the most disgusting human I 've ever encountered and , trust me , I 've been around . He would sell his weaponry to anyone who has enough scrip . No honor . No loyalty to his fellow humans . I 'm tempted to kill him , just to make the planet a better place . I 'll deliver the death stroke myself . That 's kind of you , Bebe , thank you . No . We may need to re-supply . It 's better if he leaves with a fat profit and we get our guns . Defiance won 't know what hit them . Don 't gloat , Geeze , it 's premature . A lot of things have to go right for this plan to work . Including the element of surprise . That 's essential . I need to get back . I 'm gonna find out if the carnivorous plant eats Audrey . What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . I thought this would be a welcome diversion . But my thoughts drift to my son in that VC camp . My husband insists I carry out their demands . Do you really believe my death would win his release ? I fear nothing short of a miracle will save him . It 's strange . When I close my eyes I can only picture Alak as a little boy . I keep remembering this one day . The humans have this ancient ritual called a " picnic . " Have you come across the term yet ? No . You eat outdoors among the flies and rodents . Alak was very young , and insisted we try it . I confess it was fun , in a dirty way . Until we encountered a hellbug skitterling . Alak thought it was cute and wanted to play with it . But I grabbed him in my arms and I ran . My husband tackled the beast . Killed it with his charge blade . Impressive . I held my son close , and I whispered over and over again , " I 've got you . " I will always protect you . " Now I realize that was a lie . I wish someone would give Rahm Tak the same treatment my husband gave that hellbug . Someone strong . Someone fearless . Someone like me . It would be so easy for you . The sight of an Omec ship over their camp would terrify them . They would submit to any demand . Or they , being resourceful and duplicitous , would concoct some trick to disable my ship . We could take precautionary steps . Kindzi and I are alone . We face the extinction of our entire race . Our only hope of finding other Omec survivors is with that ship . I would not do anything to put it in harm 's way . Not even for you . It seems the mood has soured . Hmm . We got a problem . What ? Every time I move a piece of arktech from Nolan 's brain , the arktech in Irisa 's brain grows larger to compensate . I need to figure out a way of removing the arktech from both of their brains at the exact same time . Okay . Well , we have two doctors , so we could do two surgeries at the same time . What do you say , slick ? Any experience doing cranial nano-surgery ? I once removed a tumor from a cat 's brain . And it lived . For , like , a year and a half . Talk about healing hands . All right . Fine . What other options do we have ? Well , I need a surgery module . One that would allow me to operate on two patients with one set of hands . Okay , well , where can we get one of these ? Nowhere close . But I 'm pretty sure that I can make one . All I need is an Omec drone . That a problem ? What are you doing here ? You have no right to intrude here ! Where 's your father ? And did not tell me where . Leave this place or I will make you leave . Nolan and Irisa will both die if you turn us away . Please . Remember , Nolan fought for you . He saved your life . From the gunshot wounds inflicted by you . Don 't punish him for my mistakes . What is it you need ? If I can interface with one of your drones , it can perform one surgery while I do the other . And steal our technology , no doubt . Is that your plan , crafty little Indogene ? Do you play both sides ? See , Mandy and I have this bet going ... Shut up . Please , Kindzi . I can 't lose him . I will help you . But then the scales are balanced . We owe you people nothing . Understood . Remember this , Indogene . I am a skilled technobiologist . You try anything tricky when you 're connected to my system , I will see it and I will kill you quickly . See , I was gonna kill you slowly . I like a little bit of foreplay . Shall we get started , ladies ? Here , Spot . Come to Mama . Good ball . So far so good . Why did you keep me if you hated us so much ? Because when I looked at you , I didn 't see an enemy combatant . I saw a scared kid who needed my help . Besides , you were different . Different how ? Well , you were born on Earth . You weren 't like the Votans we fought in the war . Are you saying you adopted me because I wasn 't alien enough to hate ? No . Because I am a Votan . No different from the millions that died . Yeah . But you were too young to experience the horror . You never saw the years of the worst of the Pale Wars . Don 't kill me . I don 't wanna die . He came after us because of the bounty on our heads . Please . I have a family . What is this ? I 'll tell people that I never found you . I don 't think we 're seeing these things randomly . Lotta scrip if he brings us in . You think he 's just gonna give up and go away ? Please . Let me go . That guy over here . They called him adolo . That 's Casti for " brother " . He 's honor-bound to avenge his family . There 's no way he 's gonna pack it up and go home . So maybe one night he comes up on us , slits our throats . Is that what you want ? No . So what do we do ? Follow through ? Follow through . The Casti heart 's on the other side . Before God ... I humble myself . As we all must humble ourselves before God . I know that wasn 't easy for you , kid . I 'm proud of you . All right , so let 's get this roller packed up and get outta here . I 'm sorry . Don 't tell me I didn 't grow up with horror . Come on . Move ! Or I 'll do you both . I want you to know that I understand . You have to put your own family first . I appreciate that . Have you tried phall vindaloo yet ? No . You are in for a treat . This way . Sneaky bitch ! Alak ! Why are you unattended ? I begged Sagyan for a break . I couldn 't take the smell of those bodies . Well , I 'm gonna have to talk to Sagyan about his leniency . Odd , though , the smell bothers you . You were married to a human . I 'm curious . Did you have to scrub really hard to get the smell off your GWA-va-yo ? I know this place . I 'm sorry . What ? About the bounty hunter . I didn 't know it affected you so much . I 'm not sorry for the lesson , though . You would have been dead years ago , I hadn 't a taught you how to survive . Hey , kiddo . What 's wrong ? You can 't sleep ? Too cold ? Come on up . Come on . Hop in . That 's it . Okay . Was that real ? Something 's happening . Was it real ? Did it actually happen ? Thought about it . I don 't believe you . Believe what you want . No , I remember that night . That was the first time I thought everything was gonna be okay . It was the first time we started to feel like a family . It happened . Because I was scared of you . I was scared of you . They 're awake . Thank God . How are you feeling ? Yeah . Dizzy . Irisa , how are you feeling ? Shtako . All right , move slow . You scared me . I don 't know what I would 've done without you . You should never have allowed them in here . Where is this Indogene now ? She took Nolan and Irisa back to town for more tests . I should strip off your skin and feed it to my loom ! You 're my commander . It is your prerogative . Don 't you understand the danger ? You allowed a shape-taker to access our network ! An Indogene ! She could have seized control of our drones ! The network is a two-way street . She was so busy with the surgery , she failed to notice that I copied her cerebral source-print . You got it all ? Everything . This particular shape-taker , Yewll , is smart , even by Indogene standards . Her expertise will prove valuable once the Dread Harvest begins . Very resourceful . But also reckless . Destroy it . Why ? Creating new Indogenes would turn Defiance against us . We 're Omec . We feed upon the lesser races . We do not fear them ! I fear anything that will disrupt the flow of gulanite and prevent us from repairing the Tsuroz ! You are young . Two bullets from a human almost killed you . Have you forgotten this ? I will never forget that . Follow my orders . Destroy it . Of course , commander . Does your head hurt ? A little . I can taste something . Burnt tires . Yeah . That 's it . So . If you 're that scared of me , why didn 't you just sink the knife and be done with it ? Because I 'm not you . Something pulled these memories from both our minds to understand that . So we could both see the lie , that 's kept us together for all these years . What lie ? I never lied to you . You taught me to believe we 're the same . Yeah , we both grew up with blood on our hands . It made you okay with killing . But not me . I hated it then , and I hate it now . I think that 's why I didn 't stab you . I have to leave . There 's no place for me here . Not with Rahm Tak coming . If I stay , I 'll have to hurt people . And if I don 't , I 'll get you killed . Don 't you worry about me . You can 't protect me and the town at the same time . I know what you have to do . It takes a killer to stop a killer . I know what you have to be . But I don 't want to be here for it . Okay . " Live together , die together " works when you have to keep on fighting . It totally sucks in real life . There 's a land coach coming tomorrow . Well , you let me know where you end up . Maybe when this is all over I can join you there . Maybe . I just finished going through your post-op scans . I didn 't want to say anything until I was sure . Sure about what ? I wasn 't able to remove the arktech . So I repaired it . Strengthened the connection . You two will remain stable so long as you don 't separate again . Meaning ? Meaning if you get too far apart you 'll strain the connection , excruciating pain , killing you both , the whole megillah . How far is too far ? I don 't know . A mile . Maybe more . Why the long faces ? You two are practically joined at the hip anyway . " Geez , thanks , Doc Yewll , for saving us from a certain death . " Hey , no problem , kids . Any time . Grab a lollipop on your way out . Go away . But not too far , obviously . What is Rahm Tak like in person ? Excuse me ? I shame myself . The question was impertinent . No , it 's all right , Andina . Why do you ask ? I saw his image the day the arch fell . He 's very handsome . Dangerous looking . Yes . I prefer my men dangerous , don 't you ? Generally , they prefer me . Some of the other servants think humans have brought all of this upon themselves . All of what ? The righteous wrath of the Votanis Collective . If humans had been better about sharing their planet then we wouldn 't hate them . That 's Rahm Tak 's whole message . There 's more to it than that . You 're in shock . You killed Christie . Oh , no , I did it to save your ... There 's always an excuse . You 've never told the truth . Ripped By mstoll

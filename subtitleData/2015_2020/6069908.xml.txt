 Damn you ... Lt. Marito ! spread out ! there would be an opening while it switched over . Looks like it isn 't going to be that easy . what are our other options ... ? Lt. Marito ! Message from the Deucalion ! HQ has ordered us to pull out . Pull out ? All our forces ? Dales and Orlov Platoons should have gotten the order by now . But ... But what ? Retreat ! Retreat ! Dales 22 ! Where is he ? ! Where 's the enemy ? ! Commander ! That invisible Kataphraktos we failed to destroy is over there . Crap . can you hear me ? Retreat ! This is ... Orlov Leader . Impossible ... I 'm the ... only ... Lightning and Invisibility ... And one other ? Order them to continue . Encircle and eliminate . Milord . Princess Asseylum ? What is this ? ! I have done all I can . The rest is up to her . Slaine ... No ... Dales 11 ! Clydesdale Leader ! Kaizuka Jr . ! Please pull out ! The smoke screen should obstruct the enemy 's vision a little . Go ! R-Roger ! Plus ... We can use this smoke to attack . - Found him . - To the right ! Get clear ! I thought you were going to keep Lightning busy ! Sorry . like it was concentrating in your direction . Crap ... We 're surrounded ? ! Looks that way . The Deucalion ? Damage report ! We 're okay ! We 're managing to discharge it ! Set us down and extract all Kataphraktoi . ma 'am ? That 's right in the middle of the enemy ! We 're landing ! 10 knots . and there 's a strong tail wind ! We 're okay ! The Aldnoah drive is handling it ! 200 feet per second ! Get aboard ! hurry ! Open ventral hatch ! Retrieve all Kataphraktoi ! At our 9 o 'clock ! Enemy Kataphraktos closing in ! Fire main guns ! Kataphraktoi retrieval complete ! We 're leaving ! What 's that ? Another enemy Kataphraktos to aft ! Same type as the one we just destroyed ! Reinforcements ? Another at our 2 o 'clock ! These aren 't reinforcements ! They 're ... 12 ... 16 ... 24 ... Number keeps climbing ! A duplication ability ? All ahead full ! Damn it ... both offline ! Crap ... Our discharge system must 've been damaged by Invisibility 's arrow . too ! 2D radar also offline ! No way ! Stay calm ! Continue ascent ! ma 'am . then ? Yes . I shall pass word along at once . There is one other favor I would ask of you . What is it ? Might I be granted an audience with Princess Asseylum ? What ? A personal audience with Her Highness ? with Count Troyard as well . I will endeavor to see that you are accommodated . It will come at a price . I understand . but not you . Beg pardon ? would be most beneficial . do not wear your ambition on your sleeve . There is a chance that it might trip you up . Of course ... Princess Asseylum is an imposter . I 'm going into space . Prepare a shuttle . Milord Slaine . not when the enemy escaped . The objective of securing territory was accomplished . Is that not success enough ? This is sure to cause more knights to swear loyalty to you . We cannot let our guard down . Nothing is less reliable than a knight 's vow of loyalty . Milord . And about that request from Count Barouhcruz ? What answer shall I give ? Go ahead . Milord ? let him see her . She is happily fulfilling her role of extending our power base . at least . It 's no use . This goes way beyond a quick fix . so I can 't even fly by eye . What 's malfunctioning ? The sensor system ? Lt. Kaizuka ? but the fuselage is carrying a charge . engine-related malfunctions are unlikely . In which case ... help us out ! We 're all kinds of screwed ! You should lower our altitude a little . Low enough to keep us off enemy radar . so I 'm scared to take us too low . 200 now . You can see all that ? Can you also pick up VOR stations ? Yes . tell me . I 'll calculate our radial . All right . What 's our heading ? I was trying to put us on 110 . You 're almost there . Fly at an offset of 3 degrees for 2 minutes . Then straighten out and maintain heading . This is bad ... Are we caught in some nasty turbulence ? you should ... I 've got this . I can handle this much . Same goes for earlier . it looks like it 's experience that 's most important . I 'll let you know . Right ! Thank you . we should be thanking you for earlier . Lt. Marito was pretty surprised that you would do something so crazy . You 're the last person I want to hear that from . " Tell him I said that . is that so ? then ? Yes . I can hardly wait for this new kingdom . And to be able to go to your homeworld . It is a world inhabited by vulgar trash . It is hardly the restful place conjured up by the word " home . I never had such a place to begin with . Neither did I. neither on Vers or in royal standing . that is my ... You honor me . then . dinner is ready . but there are still pressing matters that I must attend to . Please forgive me . Ina - Inko . What 's the matter ? about yesterday . Nina was gushing about how you helped out . Oh . Sure . Uh ... Is something wrong ? What would be wrong ? what ? but ... What do you think about the enemy coordinating their actions ? Maybe they 're so hard pressed that they 've been forced to swallow their pride . I don 't think we have much to fear . then ? That Orbital Knight named Slaine Troyard who is behind Princess Asseylum ... he one-ups even Kaizuka Jr . it 's not a simple scheme that we can counter with just superior resources . Enter . entering . ma 'am . A request for reinforcements ? Launch all-out attack on captured territory and retake it . Throw sheer numbers at them ? That 's the long and short of it . And how have you been feeling since ? I feel fine . however ... It is still rather hazy . That is hardly surprising . The very fact that you regained consciousness was a miracle . Please ... Please do not force yourself to remember . Slaine . I 'm afraid that I must take my leave now . Please get some rest . I will . I shall return . Please look after Her Highness . Milord Slaine ... I can guess what it is that you wish to ask . yes ? Taking me as her husband and founding a country ... That proclamation issued by Princess Lemrina was entirely the result of the weakness in my heart . Princess Asseylum is sure to wake up . having given up somewhere deep down . as if to reprimand me for being such a fool . how can I make Her Highness happy ? and that alone . But what of Princess Lemrina ? As to what she is looking for ... I can tell . I suspect . A place where she can find solace . But that is something that neither of us will ever obtain . We mustn 't tell her everything yet . I do not particularly mind . It 's ironic . I had waited with such hope for Her Highness to awaken . what I hope for is that her memory never returns . Your newfound resolve to serve my trusted Count Troyard fills me with such joy that I cannot contain it . Your Highness is too kind . I am fully prepared to serve both Your Highness and Count Troyard with wholehearted devotion . was touched by Count Mazuurek 's drive as he swore to rise up once again for the sake of Vers ' future even as he was held prisoner on Earth . Begging Your Highness ' pardon ... I am given to understand that you once underwent similar hardships on Earth . something similar . Terrans are all such ... vulgar trash . There was not a single one that Your Highness grew close to ? Close to ? I think not . I left all interaction with Terrans to my handmaiden . but I now see what a fool I was . Why is Slaine not here at a time like this ? making preparations for the new operation . He said as much earlier . He has been locking himself away in his castle far too often lately . can he not do it here ? I am told that precious resources are involved . Then I shall go to him . you - I shall go over to the Landing Castle . Your Highness ! Highness ? I do apologize . How long will it be ... how long will it be ... Highness . Count Mazuurek . Please follow me to the parlor . You seem to have finished checking my credentials . I deeply apologize . it is I who committed a grave blunder . To think that my ship broke down ... How fortunate for me that you were in the vicinity . I see ... Count Troyard is still at the moonbase . Milord . I regret to say that you have missed him . Lord Harklight is on his way here now . I made my move as soon as I was certain that he was not here . Troyard is commuting between here and the moonbase more than is necessary . Meaning that the princess location must be ... Please wait here . Are these Terran flowers ? Yes . This castle has undergone quite the transformation . Milord ? I was an acquaintance of its former master . fearing that they harbored microorganisms . There is no such worry here . Terran flowers are perfectly safe - then ? that is only what I have heard . but I did not expect - No . I mean ... Her Highness went to Earth alone . No one is speaking of Earth . I-I must be going ! You truly have not gone there ? Do you know what happened on Earth ? What about a boy named Inaho Kaizuka ? sister ... How long will it be before you release your grip on his feelings ? For me ? Milady . He said that he wanted me to give it to you . To the princess who knew about Earth . This is ... Milady ! I ... I ...

 Why are you doing this ? I want you to go back to your Landing Castle and find out where the real Princess Asseylum is . Why me ? Because you want the same thing as Princess Asseylum . There 's one other thing that I want you to find out for me . What Slaine Troyard 's objective is . Objective ? Take this . show this to her . She 'll know that you are on our side . Milady ! Harklight ? Pacification of the Lake Victoria area centered around the Landing Castle touchdown point is complete . Well done . The might of a united front by multiple Orbital Knights I 'd wager . I believe that this success will have impressed upon everyone the value of a leader . not with the power of Aldnoah at their disposal . Aldnoah ... Count Saazbaum lamented our hierarchical society based on Aldnoah activation rights . He even believed it was a mistake to live on Mars in the first place . humans migrated to Mars and began the war . Princess Lemrina ... Both are victims of Aldnoah . as well . But our days of being swallowed by that power are at an end . we will eventually expand our domain across the entire Earth . we will build our world . Repair status ? ma 'am . and it 's taking a long time to replace it . A mission at a time like this ... ? so our Kataphraktoi platoons will have to be transported via landing craft to the battle line . Our two platoons will attack the Landing Castle from the north and cause a disturbance and provide cover for the assault force that will attack from the southwest . but we 're really just sacrificial pawns . Perhaps Command has calculated that the odds are in their favor somehow . Do you think those odds extend to us ? ma 'am . I suppose we need to run our own set of numbers . Kaizuka Jr . Can that fast thinking of yours do something about those damn Martians ? It 's tricky . which uses electricity as a weapon . which can turn invisible . Both are formidable on their own . and Houdini . It 's like we 're in a Sonny Chiba movie or something . never into three or more . it 's always within a radius of 30 meters . there 's probably only one original that 's piloted . The rest are fakes . So our only option is to locate and destroy the original . But how do we do that ? I guess the only way is to mark the original before it duplicates and track it that way . we can use trails in the smoke to locate the Skandia . And the lightning ? Do you have any ideas for that ? and it 'll blow our electronics and actuators . the stuff that doesn 't conduct electricity . a grade-schooler ? Why am I stupid ? What 's wrong with that ? Air already is an insulator . There 's no way to block electricity that 's powerful enough to punch through so much insulation . But what makes it really tricky is the fact that these tough bastards are working together . they 're bad enough one at a time . Hang on ... I might have an idea . You 're gonna use your eye again ? it 's fine . I 'm always running a mutation code . It gets more and more optimized over time . Its predictive ability is even better than before . will you do a loadout change for me ? No problem . Just tell me what you need . What I used up there . I need those . the invasion of Earth is proceeding without incident . Slaine . perhaps you could say a few words to those Orbital Knights who distinguished themselves in battle ? you mean ? it would win over more Orbital Knights to our side . Our " side ? Princess Lemrina . Very well . what is my sister 's condition ? The reports say that she is still in critical condition . I see . all we can do is have faith in the medical staff and entrust her to their care . let 's pray for a quick recovery . Slaine . but I must go . You liar . spread out ! what 's their position ? Preliminary results are in . Sending coordinates and timing . 22 . Move out . - Roger . - Roger . Ortygia Master is our first target . Attack simultaneously and destroy it . straight ahead ! swing around to the west ! acknowledged . acknowledged ! Master is the third from the right . Commence attack ! You thought you had the original ? Guess again . will deal with the main enemy force . launch focused attack on the Skandia and destroy it . fire . Spotted him ! Over there ! fire ! Up to the same tricks again ? What an unimaginative bunch . Count Sebring ? Count Raffia ! The smoke screen vanished ? ! Colloids are absorbed by ions . This is another way to use electricity . A lightning attack from Invisibility ? ! don 't you think ? Assuming that you are true Kataphraktos operators . Main force and assault units both seem to be having trouble ! Meaning that Lightning and Invisibility are working together . what 's your status ? Data collected ! though . Can you compensate ? I 'll manage . I see ... the war has gone on for nearly two years . Milady . And it is Slaine who ... What in the world is going on ? where are you going ? To see Slaine . And to learn the truth . Milady ... You – . Why ... ? Why ... must you always stand in my way ? Who are ... I ... I am you ! Using tactical data link to analyze enemy behavior multidimensionally and deduce enemy 's habits in battle . Will deploy friendlies in positions vulnerable to enemies ' preferred attack patterns and prompt them to attack . though ... Sending most recent data . Take positions ! - Roger . - Roger . too . He 's probably right-handed . He moves counter-clockwise to make it easier to attack enemies to the left . I don 't like being bait ... Where is he now ? He 's circling around behind you . he 'll momentarily come to a stop and take careful aim . now ! Is he really there ? Found him ! Impossible ! target spotted ! launching . Mustang 00 ! Dropping ! The Skandia 's leg ... ! It can 't support the Elektris ' weight . Disengage linkup ! I will handle this ! Get clear ! Targets confirmed . fire . that won 't work ! How about these rounds ? How ? ! Electricity flows from high potential to low potential . Your lightning won 't strike an object with the same electrical potential as you . That 's to keep you from being struck yourself . Have a taste of this ! It 's too late . I 'm the same potential as you now . It can 't be ... This is the orange one I 've heard about ? Count Sebring ! I am sending assistance ! Hold on ! Inaho ! Smoke grenades ! Gotcha ! Fire ! It can 't be ... you 've killed my comrades ... You will pay ! Nao ? Yuki . 9 o 'clock ! Here they come ! Pick them off ! Princess Lemrina ? Slaine ... What is the meaning of this ? hasn 't she ? I always knew that I would have to tell you eventually . Would you mind explaining yourself ? Princess Asseylum is not quite herself yet . I needed to have you continue to portray her until she recovers . In order to create a new world . A new world ? a world free of worry . one without conflict and without sadness . And who will rule this world ? of course . Do you believe that my sister wants such a thing ? I know that she does not . That is exactly why I will make it a reality and present it to her . do you know why wars break out ? They are a means of negotiation between states . No . Wars break out because there is someone to fight against . or utterly exterminate one 's adversary so that only you remain . Mankind 's history is a history of conflict . war was inevitable . someone else eventually would have . You have changed . are you ? Princess Asseylum ... ! I told her everything . I order Count Slaine Saazbaum Troyard to immediately cease all hostilities . I thought we just needed to take out the master ! Which is the real one ? ! The one we marked wasn 't the original ! Where 's it hiding ? ! but maybe I was wrong . wrong ? ! My analysis of the duplicates turned up something interesting . everything from its orientation to its energy state . Meaning what ? Maybe he 's using quantum teleportation to create copies of himself . effectively creating a duplicate . meaning what ? ! It means that ... they 're all the real one . Slave all Kataphraktoi platoon targeting and triggers to me ! Send request to company command post . ma 'am ! Inputting coordinates and vectors for all Ortygias ... How many more is he gonna make ? ! Kaizuka Jr . ! Targets are multiplying . I need more time to update . it 's another ! Our ammo won 't last forever ! synchronized . Slaving all UFE Kataphraktoi targeting to centralized control . how much longer ? ! We 'll only get one chance . If they 're all real ... All targets locked . Fire ! Wow ... right ? Enemy Kataphraktoi eliminated . Inaho ! Yeah . I 'm glad it worked . I couldn 't have done it without you . Slaine . put an end to this . Princess Asseylum . I cannot obey your order . I am no longer a citizen of the Vers Empire . I am terribly sorry . I must take you both into custody . message from General Headquarters . You 'll have about two minutes ma 'am . That little ? Put it on speaker . captain of the Deucalion . This is Vice Admiral Eelis Hakkinen . That was a brilliant operation . Retrofit progress status ? Almost finished . That 's good to hear . It 's equipment that the Deucalion will need on her new mission . sir ? - No . You 'll be going even higher this time . You will be briefed later . Transmission ended . The laser 's gain has dropped . Comms satellite is leaving line of sight . huh ? It sounds like this is going to be a large battle . Damn it ... He thinks he can use us however he wants just because the Deucalion has an Aldnoah drive . ma 'am ? A catapult module ... - Milord Slaine . - What is it ? The princesses have been made comfortable in their quarters . I see . Even if they do not understand what you are trying I 'm sure that one day – I don 't mind . Whether or not I can get them to understand is irrelevant . a spaceship is approaching the base . It is requesting permission to dock . A spaceship ? It is a visitor from the Vers homeworld . this is Earth ? The blue planet where my father lies interred ... Count Cruhteo . Stop that . I still find it awkward to be addressed by my father 's name . Please call me Cronkine . then . I wonder ? Let 's go meet the son of Dr. Troyard .

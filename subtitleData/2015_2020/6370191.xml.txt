 Previously on " marvel 's agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Why do you want to rebuild the portal , Jemma ? Simmons : Because I have to get back there . We 're gonna get him back . Daisy : I saw something . Lash can turn into a person . I mean , think about it . He could be anybody . I know you really want to get back into action , agent morse , but the answer 's no . Understood , sir . If I don 't call off my men , Dr. Andrew garner is a dead man . All you have to do is put your weapons down , and I 'll let you go . I 'm sorry . May : No ! ¶ ¶ man : Agent may ? He 's alive . [ Monitors beeping ] Woman : Possible pneumo on the right . Let 's get him on the monitor . He 's dry . I 'm starting him on another liter of fluid . May : Andrew ... What happened ? I went into the store . I ... I had a headache . I needed something . One of my students was there . Was , uh ... Alexander : Hey , professor . [ Lighter clicking ] Where you been ? ... transfer student . He only started a few weeks ago . Had two men with him . You know , my experience is limited , but I 'd say they were professionals . It was hydra . ¶ ¶ don 't know why they 'd be after me . I do . May , this isn 't your fault . How 'd you survive ? Phil . ¶ ¶ he had a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tailing me . The man saved my life . ¶ ¶ he gave me time to find cover , and he must 've caught Alex off guard because nothing went exactly as planned . ¶ ¶ the kid had a lighter . ¶ ¶ I barely made it to the door . The blast must 've thrown me clear . The next thing I remember , you were there , picking me up . [ Sighs ] I 'm lucky . Can 't see how anyone would 've survived that . Now , I know Alex is trouble , but I 'm not sorry he 's gone . Ward would 've made him finish the job . ¶ ¶ what if ward - - he won 't . You 're safe now . We got you . We 'll let the doctor work on you . You need to get some rest . Where the hell do you think you 're going ? Uh , I think I 'm going to see Andrew . No . I just want to make sure he 's all right . You 're the reason he 's not . Ward was gonna hurt him no mat- - I made the most logical choice . Logical ? You wanted revenge . Hey , hey , hey ! Coulson 's orders were to end him . I had one shot . I took it . And you missed . You 're off that assignment . ¶ ¶ good . Then put me on it . ¶ ¶ let me go after him . Are you back ? Yeah , I 'm back . ¶ ¶ ward : S.H.I.E.L.D. sent a man to assassinate me . He came into my house and tried to kill me . 'Cause you let him in . You were sloppy . I followed your protocol . He killed a man to get close to you . He wanted you dead that much . They all want me dead that much . ¶ ¶ now we have a dangling thread . Von strucker . You shouldn 't have sent a boy to do a man 's job . Not really sure you 'd have blended in as an undergrad watching garner , kebo . Has Von strucker called in ? ¶ ¶ so , he 's either captured , killed , or he 's running . And only one of those options works for us . The kid knows too much . So go and find him before S.H.I.E.L.D. does . And if he 's still alive ... Take care of him . ¶ ¶ hey . How you holding up ? I 'm pissed . I got manhandled by lash , and it messed up our chance to see the atcu facility . But - - good news - - i have a theory . I like theories . Lash was tracking us . He knew where our truck was . He - - he needed inside info for that . You think he 's got access to atcu information ? No , I ... I think he 's in the atcu . We know that he can transform himself into a regular-sized guy and back . What if he 's hiding out as one of them ? That 's a scary thought . I 've got rosalind giving me a tour of her operation today . Let me see what I find there . Good . I 'll see what I can get on lash 's identity . And whatever you dig into , try to keep it off rosalind 's radar . I need her to trust me today . You 're not having a hard time working her , are you ? Not getting too attached ? [ Scoffs ] You do this long enough , you learn to cut yourself off from all that . Makes it easier to do the job . Sir ? ¶ ¶ is may really back for good ? I 'm not sure . Right now , she 's out for blood . ¶ ¶ may , i heard about Andrew . How 's he - - hey ! Ohh ! What the hell ? ! Hunter nearly cost Andrew his life , and he was doing it for you . I-i feel terrible . You were egging him on , letting him fight your battles for you . It 's your fault ! If I knew Andrew was in danger , i never - - ¶ ¶ ohh ! Okay . You 're upset . [ Both grunting ] ¶ ¶ [ panting ] So , you can fight your own battles . What ? ¶ ¶ you were testing me ? Had to make sure you were mission-ready . ¶ ¶ coulson still has me off combat duty . The tests say that my lung isn 't healed all the way yet . My test says otherwise . Wheels up in 20 . Welcome back , agent morse . ¶ ¶ Bob - - may : Not your mission , hunter . Stay away , or I 'll make you stay away . I just want a minute with my ex-wife . ¶ ¶ I 'm going with you . Like hell you are . You put Andrew at risk . I had ward in my sights . Damn right I pulled the trigger . You of all people should get it . I get it . You were quick to violence , and an innocent got hurt . Other people aren 't as used to your behavior as I am . Since when do you care what other people think ? ¶ ¶ you 're really going back in the field ? After him ? I 'm ready . You lying ? No . [ Scoffs ] Do better than I did , yeah ? You 're not gonna say the thing ? You already know . ¶ ¶ Andrew didn 't get all the details exactly right . He said there were four men on the scene , but only three bodies were recovered - - coulson 's man , two hydra guys . The fourth guy was one of Andrew 's students . That 's his I.D. , but it 's an alias . He 's not Alexander braun . He 's Werner Von strucker . Wait . Von strucker ? As in - - hail hydra . Ward was starting his own little hydra dynasty . Cute . We find the strucker kid , he 'll lead us back to ward . You got a how ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s been monitoring several hydra bank accounts for a while now . One just woke up . [ Computer beeping ] Cayman Islands . Well , strucker needed funds . Makes sense . What 's the op ? How 's your mandarin ? [ Speaking mandarin ] If we head down there , maybe we 'll pick up his trail . He 's on the run from ward , from us ... Almost makes me feel sorry for the kid . Werner : He 's a monster . Malick : You were right to ask me to come . I didn 't know where else to turn . I figured you and my father must 've dealt with guys like ward all the time . Ward is ... I didn 't finish the mission . He won 't care why . If you put an untested youth in play without proper training , it 's foolish . Boggles the mind , really . Your father understood protecting assets was more important than flaunting them . He never let me in on that stuff . [ Sighs ] You were nicer to me than he was . Your father was a great man . Trust me . [ Chuckles ] We would 've never put up with such things . You don 't know this guy ward . He 's scary . [ Chuckles ] I 'm aware of Grant ward . He was once an untested youth , too . Everyone has a history . So does that mean you 'll help me ? I 'll handle everything . Nice of you to pick me up . Rosalind : Yes . On the corner ... Since you won 't tell me where your base is . You know I run a spy organization , right ? And you know we agreed to share information , right ? [ Cellphone rings ] ¶ ¶ yeah ? When ? Do you know who ? All right , just have them get started . I 'm on my way . [ Cellphone beeps ] Turn around . We need to head back . I 'm sorry . It 's an emergency i need to handle . We 'll reschedule . [ Sighs ] So , this is the part where you get out of the car . I don 't think so . Do you not get how this works ? What I get is that it 's time to see this facility . No more delays . I 'll stay with you . When the emergency 's done , then we can go . You can 't . Not where I 'm going . Oh . So we 're not sharing information , then ? 'Cause you kind of just made a whole thing about that . Okay . Director coulson will be joining us . Take me home . ¶ ¶ [ tires screeching ] Hunter : I just thought you could use some help . Fitz : I 've got it . I promise . I just need to concentrate . Really ? 'Cause it looks like your mind 's kind of elsewhere . The portal simulation is just running in the background . They 're not taking any of my time . Doesn 't make it a good idea . What ? You don 't think I should help Simmons rescue will ? Do you think you should ? He 's the competition . If your girlfriend 's ex wants to visit from Phoenix , you do not buy him a plane ticket . That 's really specific . Huh ? Anyway , this guy kept Simmons alive . I owe him . He deserves my help . Just because he kept Simmons warm for a few months - - with fire - - doesn 't mean he 's someone you should save . How much do you even know about him ? What 're you doing ? In here , I mean . Why are you here ? [ Sighs ] Coulson put me on the bench . So I thought I would offer my expertise elsewhere . Is that what you 're going with - - " katelin frayer " ? Is that how you spell " katelin " ? K-a-t ... ? I 'm not sure that 's right , mate . Yeah , no , th- - there 's lots of ways to spell " katelin . " And can you please just find somewhere else to make yourself useful ? Copy that . ¶ ¶ Dr. garner , good to see you up . Do you have time for a consult ? Oh , god , yes , please . [ Chuckles ] Came off more desperate than I intended . Being laid up is very boring . What 's up ? It 's lash . Lash ? The inhuman killer monster . Oh , right . I heard you had a run-in with him . Glad you 're okay . That is what I don 't understand . Why am I okay ? He kills inhumans . He killed frye . Why spare me ? That 's a tough one . Still trying to put together an inhuman psych profile . You 're all different . Yeah , but he 's ... Really different . ¶ ¶ he changed into a guy - - a regular guy . You saw him ? Did you get a good look at him ? No , just a shadow , but still ... [ Scoffs ] I didn 't know that was possible . Me , either , but someone that big and ugly - - I mean , it makes sense . He 's got to get around without being noticed somehow . Maybe Lincoln can help . You know where he is ? No idea . He 's been off the grid since the atcu tried picking him up , but he calls sometimes . Hey , tremors , you got a sec ? Yeah . Um ... Thank you . I 'll keep you posted . What 's up ? Been thinking about your atcu theory . Now , who took off before the convoy left , and who knew the exact route we were going to take ? Banks . He 's got access to everything that atcu learns about inhumans . We should tail him . Already got a Van ready to go , full surveillance package . Infrared scanners , one-way glass ... Perfect . Let me get some things . Hunter : I 'll drive . ¶ ¶ I mean ... Please . ¶ ¶ Ms. wong would like to access her safe-deposit box . Here 's her account number . I will need your I.D.S , please . Of course . ¶ ¶ [ cellphone beeping ] ¶ ¶ [ scanner beeping ] Ms. wong likes your tie . [ Both chuckle ] ¶ ¶ [ scanner beeping ] ¶ ¶ [ tablet beeps ] Follow me . ¶ ¶ take as much time as you need . ¶ ¶ [ device whirring ] ¶ ¶ [ explosion ] Box 38 . ¶ ¶ Fitz , we need anything on strucker , anything that will get us to ward . Yeah , getting it . Real-estate deeds , passport ... No cash ? He must 've cleared it all out . He - - oh , uh ... Guys , I think you triggered an alarm somewhere . [ Alarm blaring ] [ Sighs ] Great . How much time do we have ? Uh ... Oh . Looks like zero . [ Alarm continues ] [ Vault door slams ] ¶ ¶ [ chuckles ] What is happening in here ? My boss would like to congratulate you . What ? Your security system is top-notch , and your team is incredibly efficient . Just what we 'd hoped for . [ Chuckles ] We 've been reading up on you . Oh , I see where you 're going with this . One second . We 'd like to offer you a job . A job ? [ Chuckles ] This seems most unorthodox . We were sent from your former employer , first fiduciary national , and they would like you back . I know it 's been hard , your wife missing Miami . How long have you been separated ? You know about that ? You 're only earning 4 % more than you were in 2012 . We can do better . I - - I have been looking to make a change . ¶ ¶ [ both grunting ] ¶ ¶ sorry . ¶ ¶ no one yet . Banks still not back . He wasn 't back 37 seconds ago , either , but thanks for the regular updates . This guy is bad news . Got discharged from the marines . With cause . And rosalind hired him anyway . He was part of an elite anti-alien task force after New York . [ Scoffs ] Of course he was . So what 's the plan when he gets back ? Is this a grab-and-torture kind of deal ? Chokehold might not work if he turns out to be lash . But we could - - whoa , whoa , whoa . Slow down , gitmo . I thought you just wanted to drive . Just offering helpful suggestions . Helpful in what way , exactly ? Um ... Stopping bad guys ? How about professionalism ? Doing your job smart , not getting people killed ? Hmm . Wild guess - - this isn 't about following banks . Hunter , come on . Andrew almost died . And there we have it . Look , it 's not like I just handed over Andrew and said , " hey , please kill our friend . " Right . " I had no choice . " I had no choice . I - - guys , guys . ¶ ¶ looks like we 're following him home . At a safe distance ! [ Engine turns over ] ¶ ¶ rosalind : Rosalind price , atcu . Yes , ma 'am . Sorry about the circumstances . We 'll do our best to make sure we find whoever broke in here . Someone broke into your home ? Any leads ? Not yet . Looks like the guy was scared away by your , uh ... Very impressive security system . All right if we take a look around ? Of course . Not you . ¶ ¶ this way . ¶ ¶ nice place , huh ? Can tell a lot about a woman from her books . Okay , I didn 't actually know that there were this many biographies of Margaret Thatcher . New furniture . Brand-new . Holy ... Where did you get - - don 't touch my things . Sorry . Anything missing ? You weren 't listening in when I talked to the cop ? You 're slipping , Phil . I thought you 'd definitely be scoping things out . ¶ ¶ he 's gonna go back inside when he finishes his call . What 's our next move ? He goes in his house , we 're done for the day . I don 't want to give up on him yet . I could break into his car , drop a spot cam in his speedometer . We have to be stealthy . If he catches you , we 're toast . Coulson is in the belly of the beast . We can 't tip off the atcu that we 're on to them . There must be some way we can keep - - [ Van door slams ] What - - oh , no . ¶ ¶ what 's happening ? ¶ ¶ hey ! Come on ! Oh ! ¶ ¶ so much for stealthy . ¶ ¶ here we go . And this is a good idea how ? I didn 't kill him , i-i just iced him . And screwed coulson . He 's working rosalind , and you just shot her number two . When she finds out - - she won 't . That 's what the bandana 's for . Lash is an inhuman . Inhumans have markers in their DNA . If we test banks ' blood for markers , we 'll know if he 's inhuman or not . ¶ ¶ that 's actually kind of smart . Thank you . But I still think you need to talk about your anger issues . And this isn 't the med lab . We don 't have the equipment to draw banks ' blood . Okay . There you go - - blood . Okay , there might be a small anger issue . Just pass me the swab . [ Scoffs ] All I 'm saying is that you 've been through something extreme . There will be after-effects . Sound familiar ? [ Chuckles ] It 's eye-opening , being on this side of the counseling . People treat you with kid gloves . They mean well , but the more they try to help - - the weaker you feel . Maybe it 's our phds . ¶ ¶ makes them underestimate just how strong we really are . [ Cellphone vibrating ] Might just be . Excuse me . [ Cellphone beeps ] Daisy ? Jemma , I know you haven 't been in the lab and I hate to ask you to do work , but if - - in fact , i can handle it , actually . Whatever it is . ¶ ¶ do you have time to run a blood analysis ? I want to see if banks has inhuman markers . I have plenty of time . Send away . ¶ ¶ thank you , Jemma . Simmons : I 'll call when I know . Okay . Anything ? Guy shops at costco . Anything useful ? There 's not even any selfies . Banks , you are boring . Well , apart from the fact that he might be a giant beast who blows holes in people 's chests , but ... [ Cellphone chimes ] I-i-i didn 't do it . I-it wasn 't me . I ... We know . It 's a phone . ¶ ¶ " subject en route to endotex . " No caller I.D. Something called endotex labs in gaithersburg ? We could check it out . What do you think ? Well , we 've got time before Simmons comes back with results . What about him ? We could take him with us . I 've been trapped in a moving vehicle with lash before . Don 't love the idea of it happening again . Yes , if he has the DNA markers , we know where to find him . Let 's go . ¶ ¶ rosalind : Cops finished up . Had my driver pick up some burgers for us . Figured you could use some dinner . Dj 's from around the corner ? So , your computer 's still here . Couple of tvs , too . Some big-time art pieces , i noticed . [ Chuckles ] Hardly big-time . Nice , maybe . Unusual for thieves to break in and not take anything . Well , lucky me . You got a point ? I don 't know . If you were looking to earn some sympathy from me , soften me up , say , a staged break-in might be one way to do it . Interesting . Also interesting , my home had a break-in for the first time ever on the exact day you knew I 'd be out . That 's a serious accusation . You just accused me of staging a break-in , which I did why , exactly ? Maybe I won 't like what I see at the atcu facility , so you 're trying to make me like you . Working me ever since the thunderbird . Humanizing yourself so I 'll take it better . Wow . I am quite the mad genius , huh ? Is all this stuff really yours ? I got to admit , the bat - - that was a nice touch . Triple crown winners , autographs from Mickey mantle , Ted Williams , frank Robinson , Carl yastrzemski ? Most people just looking at that wouldn 't know that it 's worth over 7 grand , but I do . Okay , the bat is not - - and burgers from my favorite place , dj 's . What possible reason would the head of the atcu have for keeping me here with that ? [ Scoffs ] You 're right . No reason at all . ¶ ¶ you want to go see the facility ? Fine . ¶ ¶ let 's go see the facility . ¶ ¶ Fitz : Okay , each of those passports has a different fake identity for Von strucker . My work is better , just for the record . We know . Right . Well , one I.D. Matches the name on one strucker real estate holding - - a penthouse in Lisbon , Portugal . So I did a sweep of passengers arriving at the Lisbon airport . He went through customs several hours ago . Nice work , Fitz . Thank you . You 're welcome . So , we go to a penthouse in Lisbon . You want to talk about what happened at the bank ? There 's nothing to discuss . ¶ ¶ I was treating fighting as a last resort . Usually , that 's good . Usually . Sometimes it 's ' cause you 're gun shy . Maybe I 'm not 100 % , but you 're the one who dragged me on this mission , in spite of the tests . Stop hiding behind the tests . I 'm not . ¶ ¶ I said i wanted back in the field . Sure . After Bahrain , i said I hated my cubicle . Didn 't mean it . Coulson says , " stay home , " and you just agree ? ¶ ¶ why are you keeping yourself locked up ? You know , I saw you train at the academy once , scouting you . I didn 't know that . Strongest recruit i ever saw . Any test would 've said you were 100 % then . But you 're better today because now you have experience . What ward did ... You think that was just experience ? That can make you stronger . Let it . 'Cause next time , talking our way out may not be an option . ¶ ¶ [ indistinct conversations ] Whoa , whoa , whoa . Careful with that one . Be a shame to see this whole place blow up before we even move in . What the hell are you doing here ? You 're supposed to be out looking for Von strucker . ¶ ¶ who is this ? Malick : You don 't know my name , but I think you 've been trying to get my attention . I 've been wondering when I 'd hear from you . You 're the one all the others were afraid of - - before me . Not everyone fears you , Mr. ward . Well , not everyone should . Just the ones who won 't fall in line . What can I do for you ? No , that 's not the correct question . The correct question is what I can offer you . The answer , in case you 're wondering , is redemption . Oh , no , thanks . I don 't need redeeming . Oh , i think you do . You made some mistakes in your gameplay , using Von strucker 's son as a pawn when he shouldn 't even be on the board yet . You see , that 's just typical of guys in your generation . You don 't even know the game I 'm playing . Von strucker is more than just a pawn . And now he 's a liability . He knows too much . Just tell me if I 'm wrong . You burned that asset . S.H.I.E.L.D. is looking for him , which means so are you . And I know where you can find him . And you 'll just tell me that ? Why ? Sometimes you sacrifice a player to save the game . You just remember when I come calling that I chose a side . ¶ ¶ mack : This is the place . Matches the endotex location . High-voltage , zinc-coated razor wire , Iris recognition ? Staggered perimeter patrols . They don 't want any visitors . It 's got to be a front , don 't you think ? So what now ? Now we use the new dwarf Fitz crafted . He doesn 't think it 's ready yet , but that 's stupid because it 's awesome , so ... I stole it . ¶ ¶ what ? I didn 't say you were the only one with issues . All right . [ Dwarf beeps , whirs ] [ Tablet beeping ] [ Cellphone rings ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Simmons , what do you got ? It 's negative . Banks has no inhuman markers . He 's not inhuman . So he 's not lash . Really ? I was so sure . [ Sighs ] Okay . Thanks . [ Cellphone beeps ] Fitz ? I 'm done helping Daisy . And since you 're done helping Bobbie and may , I thought maybe now we could take a look at the simulation . Um ... Jemma , I 've been meaning to say to you - - look , I understand if you don 't want to look into this . I 'm stronger than you think . No , no , no , no , Jemma , i have looked into it . Actually , I 've run dozens of simulations , and I kept on hoping that one of them ... Would work . Oh . I ... I didn 't want to disappoint you . The monolith was just one option , though . We 're not gonna give up , okay ? I know this isn 't easy for you . It 's an odd situation . Yeah . It 's one of the oddest , even for us . Fitz , if you knew will , you 'd understand . I promise - - Jemma , that 's the thing . I am gonna know him . It 's not even a question . ¶ ¶ I don 't care what the blood work says . That guy banks is shifty . You know he once held me prisoner on a train . Didn 't care for that . Banks was still on his way here . Endotex is obviously a front for atcu . No , there 's something here . Maybe the dwarf will find something so today won 't have been pointless . Banks wanted to be here for a delivery of something . I wonder what it is . [ Dwarf whirring ] But won 't they see the dwarf ? They will not . That 's the 2.0 . [ Dwarf whirring ] Fitz should not be keeping that locked up . What is that ? I don 't ... ¶ ¶ oh , god . Is he dead ? No , they 're monitoring him . He 's alive . But in some kind of what ? A coma ? This is atcu . This is where they 're storing inhumans they find . Animals in cages . We need a better shot . ¶ ¶ oh . Can we turn it up ? I can 't hear a thing . It 's up . This is as close as we can get without giving ourselves away . There 's noise in the background . I know how it looks . He should be freaking out . This is the sort of thing that should freak a person out . Why is he not burning this place to the ground ? He - - he 's telling her what he thinks . He 's horrified , like we are . It doesn 't look like it . Look , bring back that dwarf . Make sure we 're not discovered . There 's no way we 're working with the atcu now . Tremors ... ¶ ¶ Daisy , the dwarf - - bring it back . All right . [ Dwarf whirring ] You 're bothered by this . It 's efficient , I 'll say that . What is it ? Some kind of suspension gel ? It keeps them in stasis - - alive , healthy , just asleep . You were right about one thing - - I didn 't want to show you . Not because I think what we 're doing here is wrong . Because I know how it looks . Looks like a horror movie . Try to understand , these people were all in trouble after they turned . Some tried hurting themselves . Some hurt loved ones . Yes , they can be dangerous . I 've seen that . But it doesn 't begin to just- - this thing is like an illness . But we 're working on a cure , and we 're close - - so close to telling those people , " you 're safe . Your loved ones are safe . You can go home . " It 's like putting someone in a medically induced coma to make them better . Imagine doing that for someone who has no other shot . You lost someone . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm such an idiot for not seeing it . I 'm sorry . Big baseball fan , I 'm guessing . My husband . [ Sighs ] Not to this . No . No , it was years ago . In the field ? [ Chuckles ] No . That 's the funny part . I was the spy taking risks . He was a cardiologist , an honest man , a good husband , and cancer sucks . I 'm sorry . I would 've given anything to do this for him . Just put him to sleep for a little while until someone found a cure . I can do that for those people , for their families . I got to be honest , i didn 't expect - - what ? That I 'm human ? Not all of us are . Not fully . I am . And I think you are , too . But if you tell anyone i said that , I 'll find your base and blow it up . I find it hard to keep my humanity in all of this . Usually , you have to cut yourself off from it . I 'm trying not to . Before ... You said that you thought i wanted you to like me . Yeah . Sorry . That was - - but that part might be a little ... True . ¶ ¶ maybe . Good . [ Groaning ] ¶ ¶ ready ? You again . Good . [ Grunts ] Aah ! ¶ ¶ [ both grunting ] ¶ ¶ all right . Here we go . ¶ ¶ [ grunts ] ¶ ¶ [ grunts ] ¶ ¶ [ both grunting ] Strucker . Strucker . Where do i find ward ? Ward ... No ... Please ... ¶ ¶ [ gasps ] ¶ ¶ I 've taken down men three times your size , girl . ¶ ¶ unh ! [ Gasps ] ¶ ¶ what makes you think you can beat me ? ¶ ¶ experience . [ Electricity hums ] [ Electricity crackling ] [ Groaning ] ¶ ¶ I tried to do what ward wanted . I tried to kill him . " Him " ? Professor garner . We had him . ¶ ¶ but I didn 't know he 'd change into that thing . ¶ ¶ what really happened , Alex ? [ Lighter clicking ] ¶ ¶ [ grunting ] ¶ ¶ that 's not true . What is he ? I don 't know . ¶ ¶ we 'll return in a moment . I told you you don 't have to worry about me . Are you all right ? Staying safe ? Lincoln : Safe as houses . What ? It 's an expression . People say that . [ Scoffs ] Sure . And someday , you can tell me how you survived the dust bowl and the hoover administration , grandpa . [ Chuckles ] That 's an ugly side of you , Daisy . That 's too bad . You know the deal . I stop making fun of you when you tell me where you are . Yeah . Just ... Keep your head down , okay ? I don 't want this thing to find you . Do you have any friends out there , at least ? Not as many as I used to . How much longer till the call is traceable ? 15 seconds . [ Chuckles ] ¶ ¶ I 'll reach out soon . Hope so . [ Cellphone beeps ] Dr. garner , hey . Was that Lincoln ? He have anything to help us with lash ? [ Sighs ] Nope . Back to square one . Mm . Well , don 't worry . You 'll figure it out soon . Hey , did Lincoln tell you where he is ? I mean , he 'd be safer here , under our protection . I know , but he doesn 't believe me . He won 't tell me . But I 'll let you know when he does . [ Chuckles ] Great . ¶ ¶

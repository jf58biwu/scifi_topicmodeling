You know you order a Chambordon 1956 , and it 's close to 200 dollars a bottle , for my mother ? Yeah I know , what 're you saying ? Well you just don 't strike me as the one that would have such taste . Can you fucking get my bottle of wine so I can get the hell out of here ? Absolutely . I need to order some flowers for my mother , Estella Walker . No Estella . My mother 's name is Estella , they 're for Estella . ESTELLA . Ok great , can we keep that around 50 dollars ? Around there ? Great , Ok . Yeah . Her address is on the card . And it needs to be there before six o 'clock . Honestly I don 't care . Yeah , it has to be there before six . Okay , are we good ? Alright . Thank you . Charlie ? Charlie ? Where are you ? Come on Charlie , I 'm not gonna teleport you again . Where , oh there you are . Charlie ! It 's good to see you Charlie . Atta boy . Ceil , Charlie 's back . It worked . It worked ! Call me . It worked . Excuse me . What 're you doing in there ? This is my lab . I don 't think so , these are Rakubian labs . Rakubian labs ? This is my lab . Do you work for Syndicate Red ? I don 't work for anybody . I think you 're lying , I think you work for . Syndicate Red and you 're fucking trespassing . Just lemme see your hands , turn around and face the fucking wall . Okay , guess we 're doing it this way . The fuck asshole , get the fuck out of the road ! Ah ! Shit ! Are you okay man ? I am so sorry . Yeah man I 'm fine . Listen , can you just get me out of here ? This isn 't even my car man . So you got like no idea why these guys are chasing you ? No . No I don 't . That is crazy man . Hey , y 'know I got like nothing to do tonight , seriously nothing to do . So if you need a ride , I can hook you up . Actually wait here a minute . Yeah , yeah I 'll wait here . You sure you 're okay man ? Yeah . Cause I can wait around . Uh , no I 'm good man . Thank you . Hold on a second . What 're you talking about ? Is my mother here ? She 's here , but this is the last place you should be . Can you please step aside , I 'd like to see my mother . I 'm calling the police . Why you calling the police ? Jesus Christ why are you calling the police ? I 'm gonna call them back unless you give me a really good reason why I shouldn 't . Okay look , about an hour ago , I just found out that my house is for sale . I don 't know where my wife is , for some reason my lab is no longer my lab , and people are chasing me . Ethan , maybe you should sit down . You don 't look so good . I 'm gonna get you a glass of water and we 're gonna figure some things out okay ? Just stay right here . Well I don 't know how much longer I can keep him here , I can try . Well he 's acting strange , like he doesn 't remember anything that happened . Ethan Walker , yes of course . Oh God , you scared me . Can I help you ? Yeah I 'm looking , do you live here ? Yeah that 's why I asked if I could help you . Oh okay . - Yeah I 'm the manager . - Oh great . Yeah yeah . Um ... Does a Ceil Visanska live here ? Uh , where 'd you get those pants ? Um , why ? Uh , maybe you should give me your pants . Look , I 'm sorry , I 'm looking for a Ceil Visanska apartment number 3 . Does she still live here ? Ceil Visanska , apartment number 3 . Yeah man I 'm a little bit of in a rush . Yeah ? Yeah , are you really the manager here ? Yeah I 'm the manager man . It 's what I told you in the first place . Yeah she 's about five five , brown hair , tattoo , really pretty . Yeah I 've only been here about three months , I 've never seen her . Okay , alright , thank you . Are you sure you 're punching in the numbers right it 's Tiffany Walker , I 'm her husband Ethan Walker . Okay uh . Can you try a different number ? 818-667-1288 Ceil Visanska . I didn 't even know if I 'd ever see you again . I got it , thanks . Wait a minute , do you remember the last time you saw me ? - Yeah . - Where ? It was at the lab , this morning . What ? That 's not the last time I saw you . When was the last time you saw me ? At your mother 's party . My mother 's party ? How is that possible ? Ethan you go back . When ? I don 't know exactly but you use the machine again . Ceil what else do you know ? I don 't know if I should tell you . Why ? It could potentially make things worse . Worse ? How could they possibly be worse ? Look , the last thing you told me was to keep track and I 've had a lot of time to think about this . I think the best thing is to show you . Wait a second , what is this place ? That 's where they were killed . Freeze ! Freeze you motherfucker ! I 'm sorry about this fucking heat , I really am , I don 't have anything to do with it . Ah ! I 'm on this new diet , you see . I can eat , every few hours , they don 't mind that , but I can only eat little portions . You see what I mean , little portions . You feeling alright , you want some ? No thank you . Well . Well , we finally meet . Where you been ? How did you find me ? Huh ? - How did you find me ? - Mom 's , your mom 's nurse . She told us . Why 'd you , why 'd you come back ? It seems stupid to come back to your mom 's house of all places . You 're smarter than that , that 's what I thought to myself . Maybe you wanted to kill somebody else . I mean you 've already killed two people so maybe you just wanted to make it a clean hat trick was that the case ? 1 didn 't kill anybody . You sure of that ? Yeah . Alright . Alright . This is great . I mean I love it . I 'm never hungry because I , y 'know , I eat . You sure you don 't want some ? I 'm fine . Okay . But let me tell you something , I 've lost eight pounds . Eight pounds , I 'm not lying . You wouldn 't know that cause you didn 't see me before but it 's true eight pounds . Well . Before I start all this I wanna be very clear here , um , so what you 're saying is urn , you 're innocent ? Yeah . Okay well I 'm confused . And I 'd like you to clear up just a few details for me , that 's all . If you can ... oh . I 'm actually gonna take this . Here , look at that photograph tell me if you recognize anybody , anybody at all in this . Hey . What happened ? No I can talk I got a few minutes I 'm in the middle of an interrogation now what happened ? Oh fuck , she 's sixty years old . She 's sixty years old . You 've committed a felony . Because , it 's against the law to fuck someone that old . It really ... Oh who 're you ? What 're you doing in here ? I am Ethan Walker 's attorney and we are leaving . Let 's go Ethan . These guys thrive on threats and intimidation . I don 't want you to worry about anything , if you have any questions all you have to do is call me and I 'll take care of it do you understand ? - Thank you but , who are you ? - We have a mutual friend . Ah ! How 'd you do it ? - Do what ? - How 'd you get away ? Who are you guys ? Fuck I see what you 're doing . I get it , I get it . Gilroy , before we take him to Rakubian , let 's have a little fun with this fucker . He 's looking good , you 're smelling great . Woo ! I think you 're giving me a hard on . I think I 'm getting one up here too . Fuck yeah . Fuck yeah ! You 're gonna fucking love this . Woo ! Come on , pull it out . Okay . We were just gonna let you suck our dicks . Now , you 're getting fucked in the ass ! Oh yeah . Pull ' em down ... and turn around . I 'm not fucking with you . Pull your fucking pants down and turn the fuck around ! Hand me his gun . Hand me his gun . Slowly . Y 'know , I 've been looking forward to this for a long long time . You said you were gonna meet me at the lab and you never showed . You 're a real piece of work man . Okay , I see how this is gonna go so I 'm gonna make it real easy : How did you know I worked for Syndicate Red ? What ? How did you know who I was ? - How did you know who I was ? - I don 't know . I played this in my mind over and over . You ever do that ? Visualize something about the future ? And it becomes so clear in your mind it 's as if it already happened ? And now that moment is here , and it 's happening , and it 's not going the way you hoped it 'd go ? Why do you think that is ? I really want you to answer me this : How did you know who I was ? - Ceil ? - Ethan ? Thank God , are you okay ? Look I 'm sorry I had to get out of there the cops were coming . It 's okay I get it . Where are you ? I 'm at a payphone . Listen , I have an idea . Whoa , ahead of yourself . Hi , can I help you ? This is pretty serious . It 's definitely gonna take a couple hours . Are you gonna be okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . - Yeah ? - Mhmm . Okay . - Hi . - Hey . The virus I sent should disable their systems for about , I don 't know , 20 minutes . 20 minutes ? Is that gonna be enough time ? To be honest with you I really don 't know how long it 's going to last . What is it ? Ceil you gotta check this out . What ? The transmission wires . The ones I was supposed to replace ? - Yeah ? - They fused . I 'm saying that the transmission wires fusing created a new variable . Turning this thing into a time machine . I got it . What ? It 's right here . It turned the parameters into time coordinates . All we did was send Charlie five hours and fifteen minutes into the future . - Oh fuck . - What ? Someone called in another technician . All I know is I got a call from here that your computers are down and I 'm supposed to . There 's a girl already here . I 'm powering this down . Ceil please don 't do that . You said it yourself I got back . Okay maybe that 's not right now . No this is when it 's supposed to happen . I 'll stall as long as I can . Oh hey , oh my God I 'm so glad you guys are here . Who the hell are you ? - That 's not true , I got hired . - You are trespassing young lady . - He 's lying , I 'm telling you . - Shut up ! Charlie ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hey this is Tiffany , can 't come to the phone right now because my team is probably kicking the shit out of our rivals the Valleycats . If this is any of my girls and you forgot where the game was today , again , it 's at Deepdene Field . Hey , excuse me , was there a game here today ? Hold on , a second . Just getting some water . Great , listen , was there a game here today ? Real simple question . It 's just , was there a game . Ah ! That 's good water . - Jesus Christ ! - I 'm nearly finished . Was there a fucking game here today ? No game . Tiffany , it 's Ethan . Listen , I know this is gonna sound strange and like I 'm coming out of nowhere but just Please go to a police station . Just go there and wait . And as soon as you get this just please call me . - Yeah what do you want ? - Fiona , it 's Ethan . Listen , I need you to meet me right now . Ethan I 'm in a meeting right now . Listen listen it 's really important I need for you to cancel it and meet me right now . I can 't cancel it I 'm in a very important meeting . Look Fiona when do I ask for shit from you ? Could you just please cancel your stupid meeting and meet me right now this is really important ! Fiona ? Fiona ? ! Fiona ? Fiona ? Ethan , did Charlie come back ? And in a couple hours Fiona and Tiffany are gonna get killed ? Yes . And you 're talking to me right now because you built this time machine . - Ceil . - When do you use it ? - I need you to focus . - Okay . We only have until 2 : 30 to stop any of this from happening . - Okay ? - Okay I 'm trying Ethan . - This is a lot of shit to take in . - Oh I know , okay listen just follow me . One of the assassins in the car mentioned Rakubian , I think he meant Roman Rakubian . They also for some reason thought that I worked for Syndicate Red . Why would he think that ? I don 't know , I don 't know how ... I don 't know how any of this fits together . So I need you help . Well how do you want me to help ? What do you want me to do ? I need you to get as much information as you can . I mean anything : Past , present , future , anything that might relate them to me , you , the lab , I mean anything . Jesus Ethan , this is crazy . I know . I know listen I gotta go okay . - So . - What ? Time is running out . I 'm gonna call you when I get a new cell phone . Oh fuck . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Ethan ! It 's you . Oh my God I didn 't recognize the number and I was starting to get so freaked out . Yeah I had to get a new phone . Where are you ? I went to the field and you weren 't there . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . I 'm sorry I screwed up the game wasn 't at Deepdene it was at Ethan no , you can 't just tell me to go to a police station and not tell me anything . What 's going on ? Tiffany just please just do this . Just please go to a police station and wait . I promise you I will call you and explain everything . He 's out of college he should be out of your house . You 're enabling him . Get him the fuck out . Oh , hang on . - Oh hi honey . - Hey morn . I , bathroom . Oh honey , there 's no toilet paper in there . Use the guest one . Listen Barbara , you tell that little shit of yours to get a job and move out . Look my son 's here I gotta go . Hey mom . Listen , listen , I know what this is about . You 're upset because of the conversation - that we had earlier . - No that 's not what this is about . Ethan don 't lie to me , I know when you 're lying . Mom how long you been on the phone ? What kind of question is that ? I don 't know . Now , listen I know that when I talk about Tiffany it upsets you Jesus Christ mom could you shut up for a second ? Has Fiona called ? I don 't know . Okay I need to check out your bathroom . Okay . Okay , what is this sudden fascination with your mother 's bathroom ? Hey . Alright , listen mom , I 'm gonna have to catch you up on what 's been going on in the lab . Okay . Shoot . Ceil and I have been working on a teleporter . And something went wrong , something that we didn 't expect to happen and it turned into a time machine . I traveled 6 months into the future only to find out that Fiona and Tiffany had been killed . And in two months you 're gonna have a stroke . You little shit Ethan . I am sick of your stories and your fantasies . You have been doing this since you were a kid and you are spending far too much time in that lab with Ceil doing lord knows what . And when is the last time you had a good night 's sleep ? I want you to go home and rest up and stop telling all these stories , because if I hear you talking like this at my party later , I will smack you again . Would you mind answering the door ? We didn 't know what happened to you . I 've been to the police to try and get in touch with you . There were gunshots in my door , you weren 't there . Does mom know about all this ? No no no , I don 't want her to know . Well , what happened ? I went to your house . Someone started shooting me through the door ... - My God are you okay ? - No , no I am nowhere near okay . Someone 's trying to kill you , or me , and I don 't know why . I see you found your brother . Did he tell you I had to slap him earlier ? No . You had to slap him ? - Mhmm . - Uh , I gotta take this . It 's Ceil . Ceil again . Hello ? - Hey . - Hey . - Can you talk ? - Uh , yes . Okay where are you , are you okay ? I 'm at my moms and it 's just nuts . - What do you mean ? - Just , family shit . So did you find out anything ? Uh , yeah I found out quite a lot actually . Apparently a few years ago Syndicate Red was spending millions of dollars on teleportation research , and out of nowhere their top scientist went missing along with all of his research . And then a few months later Rakubian started spending tons and tons of fucking money on their own teleportation research . Wait a minute , when did this happen ? Like right after you and I left the company . Okay Ceil I think I know how to fix this . How ? - I have to get back to the machine . - Ethan shouldn 't we just go to the police ? Listen just meet me at the lab . Ah ! Oh you 're awake . Y 'know I usually don 't like meeting people like this . I prefer a more comfortable situation . But under the circumstances I hope you 'll understand . You used to work for me didn 't you ? I 'm truly sorry we never got a chance to actually meet , but with over 2000 employees all over the world , well I can 't be expected to meet everybody . Y 'know what 's funny ? People think you gotta wash your hands after you take a piss . As if your dick is filthy . My penis is immaculate , it 's been in my trousers all day long where it belongs . Now my hands , they 're filthy dirty . You should have to wash your hands before you piss . What do you think Ethan ? Y 'know it 's funny that a brilliant scientist like you wouldn 't have any more to say about this . Okay I know , I know how this must look . Look , let me just reassure you : Nothing 's gonna happen to you . As long as you answer one question for me . How 's that sound ? Ok good . You accept , here it is : Do I strike you as a man who 's worked hard for what he has ? That 's your question ? You Ethan , you strike me as a man who 's worked hard for what you have . All the dedication , all the sacrifice , and all that time . So , again Ethan , do I strike you as a man who 's worked hard for what he has ? It 's not a trick question . Are you gonna answer me Ethan ? Yeah . Exactly . NOT ONLY TO DO I WORK HARD FOR WHAT I HAVE I 'M THE BEST AT WHAT I DO ! AND DO YOU KNOW WHY I 'M THE BEST AT WHAT I DO ? BECAUSE I DON 'T LET LITTLE GNAT FUCKS LIKE YOU GET IN MY WAY . ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME ? ! Oh . Y 'know Ethan you are pretty smart , the only thing is you 're not smarter than me . When people think they 're smarter than me it upsets me . When people think they 're better than me , it upsets me . And when people get in my way , it upsets me . And there are consequences when people upset me . Gilroy , did you set up that massage appointment for me ? I did . - Usual time ? - Oh yeah . Good . Why are you going to kill my wife and my sister ? Ethan I don 't like your question . I 'm not gonna answer it if you don 't mind . It 's stupid , I don 't like it . I 'm just not gonna answer it . Well Ethan , I think you and I understand each other now . Wait about 10 minutes till after I leave and then kill him because if I have to hear it I 'm not gonna be able to relax . Ethan you 're gonna have to excuse me , I got a real important massage appointment I can 't miss . It 's just that it 's difficult for me to relax . I 've been trying to go easier lately , but for a man in my position it 's , it 's just impossible . Yeah he pays the bills . I know you work for Syndicate Red . What did you just fuck 'n say ? I know you work for Syndicate Red . Look I don 't have to wait 10 minutes to kill you , how did you know that ? I just do . And I can prove it , whether you kill me now or not . Make it quick I 'm losing my patience . Look I know what you guys want . But it 's not what You think it is . - Okay . What is it ? - Something a lot more powerful . Really ? And I 'm the only one who knows how to use it . So what 're you saying ? Get me out of here . Meet me at my lab in an hour . I 'll explain everything . You can hand deliver it to Syndicate Red . We know everything about you Ethan . Everything . One hour . What the fuck man I thought we were gonna wait here the fuck did he go ? Wake up . When have you ever seen me wear blue ? My car 's not blue . This jacket is blue . This is not my jacket . - Whose jacket is it ? - I don 't know what to do with you . - You can tell me who 's jacket it is . - It 's your jacket , it was in your car , - whose would it be ? - You left it in my car . - Who 's this fucking dude ? - Excuse me , hey . - Dude . - No no hey ! - Is this his jacket ? - Great now look what just happened . Is that the guy whose jacket this is ? Hey baby I got your phone call . I got here as quick as I could , traffic was insane . I 'm sorry . Baby are you okay ? What was so important you couldn 't tell me over the phone ? I was worried about you the whole ride here . Are you okay ? You look angry . Oh you 're upset . I know how you get when you 're upset . What 's going on ? He got away . How ? How is he not dead ? How is he not dead ? ! Oh Rossio , would you care to explain to my dear Fiona here how Ethan was able to escape from the both of you ? Because if I have to say it , it 's gonna really upset me . Don 't get upset . I was taking a piss , he got away from Gilroy . Fucker . Well ? Gilroy ? Turned my back for a second . Pulled a blade out of thin air . Completely got the jump on me . You incompetent piece of shit ! Why do we pay you what we pay you , Let me see your cut . Oh right here ? Right there ! Ow ! And you . You were taking a piss ? You couldn 't wait 10 minutes to take a piss ? You selfish little baby . Babies ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm upsetting you aren 't I ? Okay , alright , It 's okay . It 's okay . Y 'know , I have an idea . I think it 's a good one . - Yeah ? - I think it 'll work . - I think we should use it . - Alright . What is it honey ? - Are you still in contact with Tiffany ? - That mindless idiot of a wife ? Yes . Get that worthless bitch over to the house so we can use her as bait to lure that slippery ass gnat fuck brother of yours ! Till he fucking completely fucks me ! - And you ! - You 're so hot right now ! Darling you 're here ! The flowers were completely unexpected . Mom is Tiffany here ? You seem a little wound up Ethan . Now listen , if you 're going to start your shit with your fantasies , I 'm not having any of that . You can just take yourself back home . - Mom is Tiffany here ? - They just left . What do you mean they ? Fiona and Tiffany you must 've just missed them , they just left . Listen there 's someone you have to meet . Barbara ! My son is here . - Ethan , where you been ? - You okay ? Like , I figured I 'd just come here . Ethan ! It 's your sister . Just stay here . She wants to talk to you for some reason . Keep it short . I 'm expecting calls . Hello ? Ethan ! Thank God I got you . Look you 're in great danger . I 'm with Tiffany right now and there 's a lot I need to explain to you . I need to see you okay ? - Ethan are you there ? - Yeah I 'm here . Ethan it 's not safe at mom 's house . I think people are coming . You need to meet me okay ? Let me talk to Tiffany . Oh shit Ethan my phone 's dying . Okay I 'll text you the address just meet us okay ? Hey , everything okay ? Are they coming back ? Uh , yeah . Look mom , I have to go to my trunk and get something out , but X ' gush wank you to have a good birthday today . Okay , why are you being so serious ? I just want you to have a good birthday . I know what you 're saying . You 're trying to tell your mother that you love her . And I love you too . Oh Caroline ! Oh my God . Ethan . Ethan ? - What ? - What 's going on ? - You don 't look good . - Ceil ... - What ? - Keep track . - Keep track ? - Keep track of everything . Hey buddy . We 've been waiting for you . Hey Ethan ! Good ' ol buddy how ya doing man ? I missed you . Are you hungry ? Got peanut butter and jelly . Y 'know personally if I don 't eat when I 'm hungry I get a little , let 's just say it 's hard to think straight . Rossio I don 't like this neighborhood , feels like a weird neighborhood , would you go and watch the car please ? Well how long do you want me to be out there ? As long as it fucking takes ! Okay . Y 'know Ethan . That was quite a little show you put on a little while ago , getting away from my two best men . I was totally impressed . Now this is all starting to make sense to me now . Because honestly I had no idea what a beautiful piece of ass like that could ever see in you . But I see you 're a man of many talents . Ethan there 's something I probably should 've told you a long time ago . I 've been having a relationship with your sister . I know this may be coming as something of a surprise to you but love is crazy thing Ethan . Isn 't it ? Ethan what did you expect ? I 've given you every opportunity to come on board with us , but you 're too stubborn . You gave me no other option . So you know It 's a time machine ? A time machine . Time machine . A time machine ? Your brother 's nuttier than I thought . Do you know what he 's talking about ? He 's fucking with us . Morn mentioned something about this . Then what is it ? If you 'd been smart enough and taken some of my options , none of us would be in this situation . But you have to be Mr. Difficult . And I 'm sick of it . I 've been sick of it my whole life . It 's disgusting , you 're disgusting , it disgusts me . Having you as a brother is an embarrassment . Do you know what ? I 'm happy this is happening . You never need anyone 's help ? But now all you need is help . And no one 's around to help you . Y 'know what ? This is good . This needed to come out . I think families ought to always be honest with each other . Y 'know one of the ways I stay number one , is I keep tabs . Especially on one of my top scientists who decides to go independent . So I broke into your lab . I gotta tell you , place is a mess . I really don 't know how you bozos get anything done in there . I mean you guys are a bunch of slobs . Hell I couldn 't make heads or tails of anything in there . So we decided to download everything you had on your computer . Luckily we found the design specs for a unique tracking device . We ran the data on it and congratulations Ethan . You have designed a unique tracking device which is virtually undetectable . I mean 100 % undetectable . Do you realize the value of that ? It 's astronomical . It 's a pity you 're not gonna be able to get the credit for it . Well Fiona honey , I think we 're all done here . Is there anything you 'd like to say to your brother ? Yes . I 've always hated your wife . No ! Ethan . Wow . This probably really tough for you . But y 'know what I just realized ? I never thought I 'd feel this way . But I just don 't think I can truly respect anybody who has such little respect for the members of her own family . Oh God . Did you honestly think I could love trash like you ? That I would share everything that I 've worked my whole life for with somebody like you ? Someone who would so quickly turn against everyone in her family . And for what ? Money ? Ethan I 'm truly sorry that you had to find out what a backstabbing piece of shit your sister was . Honestly we didn 't intend to kill your wife like this . Kinda came as a big surprise . Well , I think we 're done here . Now Hank be careful he 's a slippery one . Don 't let him go . I suggest you tie him up . Obviously Rossio and Gilroy here couldn 't take care of the job . Look all I ask is you wait about 10 minutes okay ? Because with all this killing , honestly it 's kinda got me a little upset . Oh Ethan , thanks for the tracker . Come on , come on take a load off . Come on have a seat buddy . Have a seat buddy . It 's gonna be okay man . Don 't worry I 'm not gonna kill you . Alright ? Everything 's cool . Even / thing 's cool buddy just give me your hand . That 's it . No don 't worry , don 't look at me . Don 't look everything 's good . Everything 's gonna be fine . Can I ask you a question ? Did you really love your wife ? I mean , the fact that she 's dead , you still find her attractive ? You 're a sick sonofabitch , I do too . You know the only reason I took this job was because uh , y 'know you 're a really nice guy . And uh , I 'm gonna level with you . They showed me a picture of your wife and I uh , I wanted her . Bad . But uh ... staring at your sister there . I uh ... I dig brunettes man . I can 't believe I 'm gonna do this . Ahh ! Fuck 'n undead bitch , zombie fucking witch ! Ah ! I 'm still gonna fuck your wife after you 're dead . Captioning by Ryan Suits

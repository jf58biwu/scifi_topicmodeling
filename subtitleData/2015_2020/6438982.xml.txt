 I think we 're all familiar with the tragic events at Arctic Biosystems and the failure that occurred under the watch of Hiroshi Hatake . But from the ashes , a new opportunity has arisen . A scientific breakthrough : Narvik-C . Unlike Dr. Hatake , science doesn 't lie , or make excuses or feel confused . We can trust the new Narvik . It 's right there in the report . Which is why I recommend moving forward with Narvik-C immediately . We 've all made great sacrifices to prevent humanity from going off-course . Unfortunately , those sacrifices have been in vain . Alan . Sorry . It 's cool . You know , we don 't have to stop . Yes , we do . At this hour ? Come on . - Board meeting 's been rescheduled . - What ? When ? An hour ago . Why the hell didn 't they tell me ? With Narvik-C , we can finally arrive at our goal of making the planet a stable , sustainable concern . Dr. Walker , nice of you to join us . I would have joined you sooner if I 'd been informed of this meeting . A scheduling error , I 'm sure . As always , we value your input in these matters . As I was saying we at the Ilaria Corporation held out hope that nature would take care of itself . But overpopulation , diminishing resources and drastic climate change have forced our hand . We must take a more active role in the stewardship of the human race . With 17 coordinated strikes we can reduce world population by 75 percent within three months . And we 'd still have the ability to administer the cure created by Dr. Walker to any mortals deemed essential . We expect this to be a short list . I had assurances Ilaria would suspend work on the Narvik virus . You were assured we would suspend human testing . Nothing more . You told me I would have time to research and develop non-lethal alternatives . And tell us , what have you delivered ? My crop redistribution initiative is very promising . - How long ? - Fifty to a hundred years . Narvik can accomplish that in 50 to a hundred days . Pollution , famine , drought ... . They won 't wait , Dr. Walker . - This is about our very survival . - Call it what you want . It 's genocide . Must we hear this from someone who 's barely lived a single lifetime ? We 've been harassed , persecuted and tortured on seven continents . You didn 't have to see your loved ones burned at the stake . This isn 't genocide , it 's a cleansing moment of clarity . Let 's put it to a vote . Those in favor ? Opposed ? The motion carries . Next item : executive compensation . She collapsed . I did everything I could . I tried to help her . - I tried . - Of course you did . I mean , she didn 't even have any signs that she was ill . It 's better this way . She didn 't suffer . I 'm just not ready to let her go . - She was ready . - But I wasn 't . I wasn 't . This is not what I wanted . - It 's not how I wanted it to be . - Michael , listen to me , please . - She was my mother . - And my daughter . I know . And I should be falling apart right now , but I 'm not . Do you know why ? Because I 'm with you . And I know you 're going to take care of me and everyone else here . Because no matter what , you prevail . You understand ? You prevail . That is how we prevail . She 's taken her final path . Yes , she has . We will prevail . We will . Oh , thank you , Anne . Thank you . I knew I could count on your strength . Of all my daughters , you 've always been my favorite . - Sarah . Thank God . - Alan ? Where have you been ? I can 't get a straight answer . It 's a long story . Why are you handcuffed ? You should ask your good friend , Dr. Sommer . If he is a doctor . Texas Tech Med School in Lubbock . That 's the Harvard of the Panhandle . - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . - Kyle , what the hell is going on ? - You haven 't figured it out ? - He 's a mole . - Watch it , friend . He 's undercover . Apparently , I 'm the CDC 's most wanted . And I am not your friend . You 've been investigating us this entire time ? Not you , him . This man 's a wanted terrorist . Multiple counts of murder and the bombing of Ilaria in Paris . I trust him , which is more than I can say for you right now . That 's why you 're not in charge of uncuffing people . I 've been watching you . You do not have the know-how to get out of this . Then start looking closer because I 'm the guy who 's doing it . - Where 's Peter ? Does he know ? - He 's AWOL . - Well , we should find him . - I 've tried . No one 's seen him . Maybe he knew something about you the rest of us didn 't . Last I checked , I was the one who didn 't desert or get himself on a suspect list . So how about we start with what I have to say ? I filtered the honey and found pollen with three sides and distinctive furrows . - Pollen ? - Yeah . It should lead us to the source . We just have to take samples and find a match . Do you have any idea how many trees and plants there are on this island ? That could take months . What 's so funny ? M. domestica . - Of course . How did we not see it ? - What didn 't we see ? It was right under your nose all along , doctor . Three-sided pollen , distinctive furrows . That 's M. domestica , otherwise known as the common apple . Everybody 's eating apples . Why aren 't they all sick ? That 's what you need to find out . We need to take apple pollen samples , and we need to do it now . And I would be happy to do it , except that I 'm ... . You sit tight . I 'm done trusting anybody with the name Farragut . I suggest you do the same . A stroke . - Is that what he said ? - Yes . Does our father even know what a stroke looks like ? Why are you questioning him ? Because you 're blind . Mind your tone with me . Of course . I should never question , never doubt . - Just be Michael 's humble servant . - Yes . As I am . - As your grandmother was . - My grandmother ? You know , I saw her last night on her way to see Michael . To accuse him . She didn 't tell you ? The girl from the CDC , Sarah ? She has eyes just like him . All this time , Michael told us he was the only one . And the moment Agnes finds another , she dies ? Of a stroke ? Yes . And you 'd better accept it before you step out of this room . - We owe that man everything . - Maybe we owe him too much . Maybe it 's time for him to pay . Now , you listen to me . Your 20th birthday is coming . - I won 't do it . - You will do your duty . Like I did , and my mother and her mother before her . And on and on . All those portraits on the wall . All of them his precious daughters . All of them his lovers . - I 'm not ashamed of what I am . - Maybe you should be . You and Agnes and every last one of us . You made me what I am , but I didn 't ask for it . What you should be is grateful . This gift honors all of us . And like me and every one of us , you will bear Michael a daughter . - I won 't let my father have me . - You will give me a granddaughter . The line will remain unbroken . Good morning , Peter . It seems your brother 's flown the coop . So why don 't you step out into the light ? Come on now . Step into the light and let me see your eyes . Your real eyes . You 've already seen my eyes . Yes , well there 's so many ways to hide : dyes , lenses , injections . - I have no idea what you 're talk- - - Oh , come on . Come on . I 'll get answers one way or the other . Are you one of them ? Did Ilaria send you ? What 's Ilaria ? Nice try . But the correct response would have been " Who 's Ilaria ? " I work for the CDC . I 'm just a scientist . - Just a scientist . - Yeah . So then you should know the function of a catalyst , yes ? - Of course . - Well , I 'd like to introduce a catalyst to jump-start your consideration of my questions . I wouldn 't sleep if I were you . They haven 't been fed in a few days . They call it the Planting Ritual . He did it to my mother and my grandmother . It 's barbaric . He 's a great man . - You should be honored . - He 's my father . I don 't know what you want me to do . Michael 's made us all free . Oh , you 're free ? How nice for you . I 'll think of that when he 's forcing himself on me . Don 't talk like that . Don 't like having to hear something so unpleasant ? Stop . Just stop . Do you know I pray ? Ever since this horrible disease started I 've prayed . Not that things would get better . That they would get worse . That it would get so bad , it would take away his power and I could run away . I don 't want him to be the father of my child . I want it to be someone special . If only someone would make sure he couldn 't do those horrible things to me . There is a moment in every life where the body can no longer follow the path prescribed by the mind . Agnes has reached the end of her path and discarded the hollow shell that we call the body . But in a time like this , we must ask ourselves who better , who more deserving to go on so great a journey ? Agnes was the best of us . A caring soul brimming with love and a gifted scientist whose miraculous abilities gave us the sweetest of all of our garden 's bounty . Everything sweet on this island was made so by Agnes ' creation . The hybrid Chester blackberry that , like the life she taught us to lead survives the worst conditions . So let us honor her and partake in the greatest gift she created . - Get off . - You 're trying to kill me ! I need some help here . Where 'd these new infected come from ? I don 't know . The screams started 10 minutes ago . - What do we do ? - Get these people into quarantine . What if there 's not enough room ? Find the biggest room , round up the sick . - They won 't come willingly . - Use physical force . They 're having a psychotic break , they won 't listen to reason . They 're not your friends and family anymore . Divide into teams of two . Use ropes , belts , whatever you can find . We need to restrain these people before they hurt themselves . - Now go . - Quickly , everyone . That 's not the face of someone who got her way . That 's because I didn 't . - But everything they promised ... . - Is now un-promised . The facilities are operational in 17 major cities , shipments are moving . They 're making plans to ensure the nuclear power plants don 't melt down . This is happening . - So this really is the end of the world . - Not yet . It 's still a week before they can pull the trigger . Sergio ? I 'm sorry . I 've seen a lot of death in my time . Hell , I 've caused a fair share of it . But the scope of what they are planning is ... . I 'm gonna contact the CDC . - Blow the whistle . - Is that our best option ? It 's not like the CDC 's been able to contain the virus . Who knows how long it 'll take them to coordinate . It 's our only option unless you have a better idea . You know how Ilaria deals with traitors . I 'm not asking you to be part of this . Guilt by association . There are Ilaria safe houses around the world . Yeah . I 'm sure I 'd be safe in one of those . What 's this ? Little souvenir from Arctic Biosystems . Best served chilled . - The cure . - A single dose . Keep it safe . It 's about to become the most valuable substance on Earth . What happened ? You get the samples ? We got a new outbreak . At least 30 victims , maybe more . Anne 's putting together teams to get them into quarantine . - Thirty victims ? How ? - I don 't know . We gotta get this thing under control . It 's a war zone . Hey , watch it . You 'll pop your stitches . He 's right . - You gotta sit this one out . - What ? No . You cannot triage an abbey 's worth of unstable patients on your own . - I 'm coming with you . - For God 's sake . - Take me out of these cuffs so I can help . - No way . Where will I go ? We 're in the middle of the ocean . - I got my orders . - They can recite them at your funeral . If you don 't let me out of these cuffs , none of us are getting off this island alive . Let me go ! I need those sedatives . What 's the holdup ? I was explaining we only have 20 injectable doses of diazepam . - I can 't allow you to use it on our people . - See what I 'm dealing with ? We don 't see Western medicine as a positive step to being . Anne , these people are suffering . What you call suffering we see as a difficult but necessary path . I don 't give a damn what kind of kale smoothies you 've been drinking . People are gonna be pulling out of their restraints . No amount of " being " will keep them from ripping out your throat . He 's right , Anne . Hello , Jerome . I 'm glad your path brought you here where you can be of help . I know where my path is gonna take me when this is over . Please . Let 's not let unfinished business get in the way of caring for the sick . And don 't let dogma prevent healing . It 's the CDC 's job to make sure our people get well . Isn 't that right ? The sedatives will provide comfort for six hours . - And what do we do after that ? - Sominous ? It 's a hybrid of valerian , skullcap and mother 's wort . Agnes was making it before she left us . It 's an excellent sedative . It can be administered orally in a tea . Hello , Olivia . I brought you something . I thought everyone had forgotten about me . Of course not . Things have gotten a little crazy . I heard screaming . What 's going on up there ? There are a lot more sick people now . The CDC doctors are locking everyone in the refectory . Monsters . I just hope they don 't do to them what they did to my Soren . Truth is , no one knows what they 're doing . You may be in the safest place in the whole Abbey . They had no right to punish me . Doesn 't Michael say that a true path is always righteous ? That he does . Then I 'm glad I stabbed that CDC woman . I 'd do it again . Please , Olivia . - Don 't say that . - I mean it . No one was sick until they got here . And now Soren 's gone . They killed my son . Who 's gonna be punished for that ? I don 't know . I just wish someone would make them go away . This Valerian skullcap stuff , it 's gonna work , right ? - My mother was a brilliant chemist . - That 's not what I asked . I need to know we 're not gonna have a slaughterhouse on our hands . It will work . How did 83 people get sick at the same time ? They were all exposed to the pathogen simultaneously . So , what was the axis event ? Breakfast ? This is the same diet as every day ? Nothing was added to the menu . Were all these people together somewhere ? Maybe the orchard or the counsel hall ? We were all at the memorial service for Agnes . We all ate the berries , the hybrid she created . - All of these people ? - We all ate them , even me . If you were gonna be sick , you 'd be sick already . Still , eating those berries is the only thing the infected have in common . That 's where we start . It 's the black hole . No light can escape . Listen . I know you 're in pain , but I can help . - I 'm a doctor . - Pain is fleeting . It goes in the hole . Understand ? Once it 's in there , it never escapes . - I understand . - Never . Never . I understand . Please . Please . Just get me out of here . The things they want gone go in the hole . In the hole . Look , hey . Listen , listen . Just you pull up the grate and I 'll do the rest , okay ? - Pain stays in the hole . - No , no , no . - It can 't escape . - No , no , no . - No , no , no . - Pain goes in the hole . Pain goes in the hole ! Here 's the next batch . Say , Sarah , you wouldn 't happen to have some gum , would you ? Oh , so now I 'm " Sarah " now that you need something from me ? Didn 't think we 'd be here this long . I 'm out . You do know too much xylitol can increase your blood sugar levels , right ? Thanks . I 'll remember that when I go for my Ph.D. in gum-ology . I 've got something . It 's definitely a fungus . It looks like the same one we found in Soren 's blood . Is it in all the samples ? No . Only in wells 3 through 9 , 15 through 21 , and 43 through 48 . And those all came from the same batch . Only some of the berries are contaminated . - Well , that rules out accidental exposure . - What are you saying ? - Think somebody did this on purpose ? - It 's the only explanation . Half the bowls were spiked , probably with contaminated honey . The only question is , who had access ? Hello , Peter . Are you ready to talk ? There 's been a new outbreak . And I know you 'd like to help your friends . They 're struggling without their leader . Then let me out so I can help them . In good time . Provided you help me . And how do I do that ? Your friend , Sarah , she 's very special . And please don 't pretend that you don 't know about her or me . But I 'd like you to tell me how she got to be that way . I don 't know . I wasn 't there when it happened . Oh , I get it . You liked those rats . You wanna see how many more I can fit down there . I mean , I was sick , out of my mind . I wasn 't a part of it . Well , maybe you just need a little more time to think about your answers . I 'll be back , say , in a year or two . No , no . Wait , wait . I know the people who made her immortal . If you let me out , I can get the information . If you give me something I can use I will contemplate your release . I don 't know what made Sarah immortal , but I know about her baby . It 's immortal too . At least she thinks it is . Her ... . Her baby ? She has an immortal child ? She was pregnant when she became immortal . You 're sure about this ? Yeah , of course I 'm sure . Thank you , Peter . I think we 're going to be great friends . Hey , then let me out of here . - Please invite Dr. Jordan to my office . - Hey ! And bring the restraints . Hey , let me out of here ! Hey ! Come on ! Michael ! Michael ! An immortal child ? Not just that . The child might be the way to make the rest of us like Michael . Are you sure that 's all he said ? Isn 't that enough ? Enough to make you bring Dr. Jordan to me instead of him . But ... . Michael told me- - I know what he told you , but don 't you understand ? The moment I was born without the eyes , I 've been good for only one thing . To bear him another daughter . And he 'll keep doing it to every one of his daughters . Do you know why ? Because every time he does , the mortal part gets weaker and the immortal part gets stronger . That 's why it has to be his daughters . He thinks one day he 'll have a child like himself . Don 't . - Damn it , Amy . - What did you just say ? You heard me . I 've done a lot of things , bad things . I 've done them for you . And you 've received nothing in return ? I didn 't say that . But Michael has Anne asking questions about how people got sick . She won 't find out . She 's not just gonna let you do whatever you want . - If I get caught- - - You think I would let you suffer ? Little you think of me . Of us . You keep telling me there is no " us . " There 's either you and me or you and Michael . You can 't have both . When you make a decision , that 's when you 'll know if there is an " us . " Hello ? Is someone there ? I guess I don 't have to ask how you got in . We do own the place . Please , sit . - I don 't have time for games . - More 's the pity . I 've spent the balance of a hundred years learning to make the perfect coq au vin . Turns out the secret is in skimming the impurities from the sauce . Much like what Ilaria is trying to accomplish . Why are you here ? Why is any of us here ? You ask that a lot when you spend so much time around people with agendas . Like our colleagues at Ilaria . You still haven 't answered my question . Your plan to inform the CDC will fail . - Balleseros told you ? - Oh , please . I heard your protests , I saw the files you pulled from the data banks . The rest was arithmetic . Don 't beat yourself up . We 've been doing this a very long time . What is that ? Our last chance . Turns out I don 't relish the idea of spending eternity in the company of the same silver-eyed dullards any more than you do . No more than I like the idea of exterminating humanity . And I 'm not the only one who feels that way . " Mademoiselle Durant " ? She 'll be at the Jardin De La Jeune Lune tomorrow at 9 sharp . Don 't be late . I do hope you 're not vegan . Oh , damn , that is good . Everyone , please stay . Please . I 'd like you all to see this . Is something wrong ? Well , I don 't know , Amy . Is something wrong ? I 'd like to know . Is there anything you need to say to me ? No . What 's wrong ? You 're scaring us . Landry , would you be so kind as to search that locker , please ? - Whose coat is this ? - It 's mine . Oh , Anne . How could you ? I have no idea how that got there . Of course you don 't . Bring her . Look , this is ridiculous . Step aside . There 's no way she brought that into this Abbey . Oh , you mean the source of the disease ? The reason why we 're all cowering in fear ? You made them all sick . No . Why would I ? I don 't know . But I 'm gonna find out . No , Michael . I 'd never do that . I 'd never do that . Please , Michael . Mademoiselle Durant ? After 500 years ? Really ? That was very rude of her . I 'm sorry ? No need to be sorry . Madame Walker , I presume ? I am Mademoiselle Durant . I never could get used to the contact lenses . Don 't be so surprised . You know we come in all sizes . I hear you met that little shit who calls himself " The Scythe . " I did . It 's because of people like him that there are people like me and Madame Wallenberg . What kind of people are you ? The kind who know damn well you cannot change the system from within . A young person 's mistake , but there 's hope for you yet . I need more than hope right now . We need you too . There is another renegade immortal . Not one of us . But he 's been working on something very promising . A project that might prevent our friends at Ilaria from ending the human race . - Well , tell me . - There is much for you to learn . And it begins here . Cut the bonds and get them out of those beds . We need to save our brothers and sisters . Hey . Hey , what are you people doing ? You gotta put them back in the beds . Hey , when these people come to , they 're gonna be violent . - Don 't you understand ? - Olivia ? What is happening here ? What does it look like ? We 're taking care of our own . Olivia , you know me . I 've lived here . You lived among us , but you were never one of us . But you have to let us help these people . I took your help , and I lost my son . Now is our time to show these sowers of disease and discord that they can 't bully us . We stand together . - Let 's go . - Together . Come on . Let 's go . - We 're not gonna win this one . - We let them take the sick ? For now . I 've seen this before . Frightened people blaming their doctors for their disease , hurting , even killing . Get to the lab , protect Sarah . Go . Now , now . I don 't know what 's taking Alan so long . He knows what he 's doing . I hope so . Those people were ready to kill . They 'd have turned on us in a moment , no problem . That 's ironic , coming from you . Hey , I 'm just doing a job . Like you . Not exactly like me . - This doesn 't make any sense . - What doesn 't ? No . Something must be wrong with the spec . Seeing as it probably shares a birthday with my daddy ... . What 's it saying ? The apple pollen samples you gathered tested positive for the fungus . Great . Now we know how the honey got infected . Except there are no traces of mycotoxin in the apples , only in the honey . So the honey makes you Mycotic and kills you , but the apples don 't ? - Kyle . Sarah . - Alan , great . We need fresh eyes on this . Come here . Kyle , we 're conducting a room-by-room search for the Mycotics . We could use your help . You calling the shots now ? Just conveying information . All right , all right . I 'm coming .

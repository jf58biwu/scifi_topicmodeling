 This unprecedented streak of natural disasters across the globe ... - _ - People grasp for any kind of answer . Well , if you 're talking about the social-media nonsense about the end of the world , it barely merits ... Oh , but it is not nonsense to say that we have abused the planet , and Gaia is ... We have to distinguish between physical events and tales of the paranormal . Look , this could all end tomorrow . The world , you mean . Hey , I got the pre-Columbian files and the stuff from the dig in New Mexico . Great , great . We had this all digitized , remember ? I 'm not sure we 're gonna have power for this little while . Here , put it in here . Is that it ? Okay . Hey , find yourself somewhere safe and stay there till it 's over . I got to get to my family . Here just in the last few weeks , earthquakes in Asia , South America . Mount Etna erupts . Not to mention the inexplicable number of storms here ... Come on , Karen . Our grid is presently down . Please ... The outbreak of disease ... I can 't believe any son of mine is going to the Peace Corps . I just don 't hang around with a torn ACL . If I can 't play football ... I 'd be doing some good . Mm . Couldn 't have thought of the Air Force ? Did good for me . Oh , at least " Peace Corps " sounds military . It 's got " Corps " in it . And " Peace , " which makes your dad happy . Covering all the bases , as usual . Let 's move it . This is a historic shot right here , because this is the largest mass evacuation in U.S. history ... 2 1 / 2 million people hitting the roadways . The issue is a massive burst of energy from the Sun called a solar storm , and there 's a couple ... 200 people have been injured . Some of the wounded are still ... NASA said the objects will pass very near the Earth , possibly skimming the atmosphere . But there will be no damage . Tsunami watches are in force from New Jersey to Virginia . A sturgeon consumed two children in the Skagit River today . Grab me the garbage bags , will you ? Right , ' cause I would know where the garbage bags are . Girl can dream . Hey , can you keep a secret ? No , don 't tell me anything . I 'm going to Seattle tonight . First , you 're coming outside to help me clean up . Dana , listen to me . Gramps is letting me live with him , and I can still stay in school . Mom and Dad already said no . Melinda 's picking me up , and I 'm taking the bus from Yakima . Bri , we 've had storms for a week . There 's no phones , no Internet , no power . Plus , my friend Marty says everyone 's getting sick in Garfield County . Not the time to chase a guy to college . I 'm not chasing him . He loves me . You know I have to tell Mom about this . You don 't tell Mom anything . Because you make me part of all your stupid shit . You 're kind of a genius that way . Dana , I am old enough to do this . I 'm 17 , for God 's sake . Yeah , except I 'm 16 , and we 're twins . 17 in two weeks , whatever . Yeah , if you live that long . Now help me ? Really ? We 're sorry . The Copelands , Karen and Josh ... Are not available to take your call . - Please ... - Come on , Karen . Before turning the gun on herself . Come on . When officers pulled up to the westbound off-ramp of the MacArthur Causeway , they found one man mauling , chewing the face of another . When that officer ordered him to back off and he didn 't , they opened fire . New disease affects the brain and spreads rapidly . It is being blamed for a wave of savage killings across the country . Perilous times are upon us , and we must be ready for the ... What the hell ? Of the day and the hour , no one knows . But it is coming like a thief in the night . So the question is , are you ready ? Well , people , get ready , because the signs and the portents are there . Hey , Karen ? Karen ! Yeah , yeah . What 's up ? Hey , come here . We had power at the university for 20 minutes today . They said there 's a Category 5 hurricane headed this way . - Hurricane ? - Winds up to 170 miles an hour . - Girls , let 's go . - The physics are wrong , Dad . Hurricanes need warm water . The Pacific is freezing . Okay , then , Bill Nye . Explain that . We got to get in the house , close the windows , get to a low point . - Get inside ! - Shut all the doors . Let 's go ! Come on , guys . Two windows gone upstairs . All right , we stay down here . Everyone remain calm . Everything 's going to be fine as long as the roof holds . We 'll be all right . - Is this an earthquake ? - It 's all right . It 'll be okay . Dana ? Honey ? Where 'd you go ? Here , Mom . Oh , hey , babe . You 're up early . What are you doing ? Trying to save a few of the fish . The fish ? Oh , my God . The essence of the explosions was sonic booms and not meteor impacts . That is so gross . What on Earth ? These are saltwater species . So how 'd they get here ? Storms pick them up and drop them inland . It happens , but it 's rare . It stinks . It 's freaking biblical . That 's a ... that 's a good word for it , Matt . Um ... And obey all laws . The government is working to restore power across the United States . Across America ? How big is this thing ? Matt . Obey all laws . Earl . Josh . Hey . Those fish ? Yeah , yeah . Hurricane must have picked them up and brought them inland . Aldersons got snakes . What do you mean snakes ? I mean snakes . Well , how many ? Well , how many fish you got ? I don 't know ... probably hundreds . Well , that 's about how many snakes . How you folks doing otherwise ? Uh , good . Good . Lost a few shingles off the house , a couple of windows , but that 's it . Yeah , well , insurance won 't pay . This whole thing 's an act of God . Let 's hope not . Hmm . Yeah , well , there 's lots of stuff going on . Heard that there were quakes all over the place , but none on any fault lines , and some big storm cut Cape Cod right in two . My friend Jenny actually texted me while my phone was working for , like , four seconds , and she said that there were , like , apparitions in New York and faces looking in windows but 40 floors up . Your friend Jenny 's an idiot . You 're an idiot , Dana . Shut up . Listen , Josh , I got a favor . My sister 's kid goes to your college . Clark Becker ? He and a friend were camping up in the hills , and they haven 't heard from them , and I 'd appreciate it if you 'd be on the lookout . Sure . Green SUV ? RVL6768 . Busy day , huh , Earl ? Oh , yeah . Trying something new ? Putting the prisoners in the front seat ? Oh , he 's no prisoner ... Poor fellow . I just found him wandering . I 'm trying to get him some grief counseling or something . He 's part of that bad business over in Richland . What business ? Everyone went out of their heads . Well , panic can do that . No , this wasn 't panic . This was stone crazy , violence and stuff . My brother got sick two days ago . Well , is he all right ? Cops shot him dead . They shot him ? Yeah , he was skinning his wife alive . Not that she 's alive anymore . Yeah , all right , we better get going . Will you keep an eye out for those kids for me ? - All right , thanks , Earl . - Yeah , yeah . Let 's go clean up . Come on . The quake , which registered 6.1 on the Richter Scale , was ... Okay , really , who skins his wife ? The guy was disturbed . You don 't even know what happened . Reports of an outbreak of a disease causing delirium and violence ... Probably didn 't happen . Hello ? Is anyone home ? My name 's Clark Becker . That 's Earl 's missing nephew . I-I need help . You know , your , uh , uncle was here earlier looking for you . We got nailed by the storm . We had my mom 's SUV , but we dumped it after the quake . I think we got a piece of it out front . That 's disgusting . All right , uh , Brianna . Would you like some dessert ? - Dude . - We have utensils . Not cool . Hey . Hey ! Mom ! Dana , the Bible , the Bible . Okay . Come here . Dana , gun ! Out of the way ! What the hell was that ? What was that ? What did I just kill ? We have a gun ? Jesus , Mom . What was that ? You stay here . I 'm going to the police . A person died . Shots were fired . I 'm going to report it . - Mom ! - Listen , I 'll go . Let me go . Kids , reload the gun . No , what if you need it ? I 'm going to the police station . There will be tons of guns there . - Damn it , Karen . - Just take the kids inside . I 'll be back soon . Get inside . What are you doing ? Don 't let her go ! - Like , holy ... - It 's the right thing . - It 's the right thing . - How could you let her go ? She was Air Force . She 'll be okay . Now , come on . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . We 're gonna lock the doors . We 're gonna barricade them . Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go . Let 's go . Inside . Hello ? Hello ! This is taking too long . Where is she ? Everything 's locked up upstairs . She 's still not back ? Nope . How do we know one of those things didn 't get her ? - Is that her ? - That 's her . She 's back . Oh , thank God . Give me the gun . - Give me the gun ! - What ? Lock the door . Hey , hey , let her go ! Let her go ! I 'll shoot ! I 'll shoot . Hey . We have a shotgun ? We do now . Well , the kids are finally asleep . I 'll take first watch , if you want . No , I 'm working anyway . Why don 't you get some sleep ? I don 't think the university 's going to be open anytime soon . No , it 's more practical than academic . Uh-huh . Look , Karen ... there is no denying what we saw today . That something came out of that camper . And the two guys in the jail ... No , no , no , there was nothing inside them . I ... they were just batshit crazy . I don 't think that explains what I saw . So I just want to do some research . Maybe I can , you know , come up with some other possible explanation . You study religion , archeology , and myth . So what does that have to do with anything ? I think that there 's a lot more going on here . I don 't think there 's any way that you could explain what happened with traditional biology or ... Okay , just ... Do you have anything concrete or , like , helpful ? I don 't know . It 's been a rough couple of days . I don 't know if I can take anything else in . Yeah , you 're ... You 're right . Maybe I 'm just ... Overanalyzing everything . Our world is falling apart , but at least we 're all together . I 'm gonna do a little more reading ... if you want to go get some sleep . It 's actually a really beautiful day . All right , let 's get started . All right . Mom , are you getting service upstairs ? No , I thought for a second , but nothing . Shit . Brianna ! Brianna ! - Brianna ! - Brianna ! Brianna ! Brianna ! Oh , Bri ! No ! No . No . * * * This has a fifty gallon tank , a bed and a generator . Get in . - Okay . - Here . Where the hell was that ? - Josh , let 's go ! - Yeah , yeah . - What are you bringing that stuff for ? - Think of them as road maps . - She took off to the northeast . - That 's where we 'll start . I left a note for her . You don 't think someone should stay here in case she comes back ? We stick together . How long are we gonna be gone ? As long as it takes . I 'm scared , Mom . Do you think Brianna 's okay ? I 'm scared , too , hon . We 're gonna find her . Holy shit . Oh . How did you get me here ? Who are you ? Who am I ? You 're the one who took me . What do you want ? You stay away from me , and I 'll stay away from you . Got it ? I don 't remember anything . How did I get here ? I can 't get anything on any station . So this was essentially the biggest storm ever . Seems like . There 's a gas station . It looks intact . I thought we had 50 gallons . You got to fill up whenever you get the chance , Matt . You want gas ? Uh , yeah . I 'll ask you to step back into the vehicle . No gas , huh ? Sure , there 's gas . It 's full service only . Okay . I just need a couple gallons . You have power ? All the power I need . Hey , no , that 's ... That 's really not necessary . Thank you . Stop that . Please stop that . Ugh , knock it off ! I said I do full service . That 's disgusting . - Stop it . - Hey , knock it off ! - Stop ! - Dad , what is that ? - What ? - Ugh . Oh ! I see the problem . I-I see it . Yeah , I see the problem , all right . We got to get out of here . - Oh ! - Jesus Christ ! - Oh , my God . - Drive . There it is right here . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Drive ! Hey , you didn 't pay for the gas ! Thieving rat bastards . That was crazy . That was like the guys who were in the police station ... Totally out of his mind . What the ... What the hell is happening ? - Hey , baby , it 's okay . - It 's all right . It 's okay , baby . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Dad , I 'm scared . - Honey ? - First Brianna and now this . It 's okay . Hey , look at me . Why is ... why is this happening so fast ? I don 't ... I don 't understand . I don 't ... I don 't get it . I don 't know , but listen , we 're gonna be okay . We 're sticking together . We 're gonna find your sister . And we 're gonna make it through this . Special measures ... Hey , hey . An emergency response zone is being set up in the city of Yakima . Food , shelter , and medical help are available in Yakima ... Listen to this . This is great news , okay ? Authorities have announced ... We 'll text your sister . She 'll get it when the system comes up and know to meet us in Yakima . It 's great , right ? We don 't know where she is or if she 's even alive . She 's alive , Matt . - How can you know that ? - Because I know . The systems are getting rebooted , and we 're meeting her in Yakima . That 's what 's happening . That 's what 's happening . Holy shit . Oh , no , no . They 're hanging people . Just drive . Just drive . Oh , God . _ Hey ! Hold on ! Wait ! Wait ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hands up . Hands up . Don 't move . Mr. Dawkins , it 's me ... Brianna Copeland . You 're friends with my dad , Josh Copeland . He works at the university . Look , I-I-I 'm trying to get back to my family , all right ? They 're in Yakima . You 're the Copeland girl ... oh , the funny one . Yeah . Do you think you could help me out ? Okay , come on . Get in the car . Let 's go . Oh . Always remember , little missy , policeman is your friend . Pull over . I got to take a leak . I 'm sitting right here . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . What the hell , Mr. Dawkins ? How do you know my name ? What do you ... We went over this already . I told you you 're a friend of my dad 's ... Professor Joshua Copeland . He works at the university . I saw you yesterday . No shit ? I-I 've known you going on , what , like , ten years now ? Hey , Jacobs , how long I known you ? I don 't know . Couple hours ? Look , I really need to get to Yakima . I 've always wanted to see Paris . Hey , little missy here says I 've known her ten years . Now , does that sound right to you ? I don 't know . Ask the sergeant . What sergeant ? The sarge . Hey . Hey , Sarge ? Sarge , does this little girl seem credible to you ? Stertorous breathing , pupils dilated . Seems to be having trouble talking . What should we do ? Render assistance , I guess . Yeah , I guess . Mm , I like your hair . Come on . Come on . What 's this ? What do you think ? She 's waving us down . She must need our help . What 's in it for us ? I hope that 's a joke , Matt . Hold on . I 'm coming with you . No , you 're not . Stay here . Cover us . Oh , thank God you stopped . I 'm Ella . This is my husband , Norm . - Karen . This is Josh . - Hi . We 've got a first-aid kit on board . Don 't touch me . These men , they ran us off the road . They said they were hungry . Norm 's an accountant . He 's a stickler for planning . We had food for three days . He wouldn 't give them any , so they took everything . We have plenty of food , if you don 't mind military rations . We would appreciate that so much . Uh , look , we 'll even trade you for it . Don 't give them anything ! Stop it , Norm . They beat me half to death ! We 're not gonna hurt you , buddy . We just want to give you some food . Not if I take it first . - Whoa , whoa . - All right . Put the gun down , Norm ! - Put the gun away , buddy . - Norm , put the gun down ! - I 'll use it , I swear . - No , you won 't ! Come on . You haven 't even held a gun before . You don 't know that . Come on . Come on . Put the gun away . Norm , stop it . I 've been shooting all my life , pal , and you might as well be a quail . That 's ... that 's some meteorite . All right . Come on . Why don 't we try being friends ? Put it away . I 'll make you some coffee . Okay . It 's okay . By the way , Norm , word of advice ... You had your safety on . Shit . I heard something on the radio , but they weren 't supposed to hit the Earth . Well , that one did . We 're lucky it didn 't hit us . Hey . Eggs are up . You smell food ? Huevos rancheros . So ? So we shot the cook the last time through . Was that today ? Yeah , two hours ago . Health code violation 353C . Storing raw food with cooked . So who 's in there now ? Somebody who doesn 't respect the health code is who . All right . You go in the front and occupy ' em , and I 'll go in the side and hit ' em . Yeah . Wait , wait , wait ! What about our suspect ? She 's probably connected to them . I 'll bring her with me . All right . Meet you in there . Well , come on , little missy . Let 's go see your friends . Whoo , damn ! It smells good in here . Whoo ! Forks down . Hands up . So ... who 's in charge ? Me . And who are you ? I 'm an officer of the law . Named ? I 'm , uh ... Uh ... You know my name ? Yes , Mr. Dawkins . Yeah . Yeah ! Anyway , it 's not important . What 's important is that you crowd have the requisite permits to be operating that flat-top griddle back there . Look out ! Requesting assistance . Officer down . Requesting assistance . Officer down . Requesting assistance . Oh , shit . - Requesting assistance . - Officer down . Officer down ! Requesting a ... Why did you choose us over them ? Because I thought they were gonna kill you . Good answer . What the hell ? No blood . Good . They were Feverheads , little girl . You might have had it too . There 's no blood in your mouth . Come on . Let 's get the hell out of here . Hey . Hey , what the hell 's a Feverhead ? It 's a disease makes people crazy . We had to kill two of our own friends yesterday . Those two cops ... They had it , too . Well , I-I don 't have it . No . But it 's everywhere around here . We 're riding our way out of it . Hey , look , I just saved your asses in there , so maybe you could do something for me . I need a ride to Yakima . We 're not going to Yakima . I just saved your life ! All right ? Please . I need to get back to my family . All right . I 'll take you to Yakima . Get on 97 up to 2 , then head west . I 'll catch up at Everett . Well , get on . You think Brianna is in Yakima yet ? Yes , I do . So why don 't we get there tonight ? Because it 's not safe to drive at night . But the roads are fine . The Army Reserve controls Yakima , so it 's a safe zone . We 're not gonna get killed trying to save six hours , 'cause we know she 's there and she 's safe . Do you guys remember when Brianna used to run away all the time when she got upset ? You guys know she was on the roof the whole time , right ? What ? Yeah . I looked for her for , like , four hours . First night that we got this camper ... Remember the first night ? Your mother and I took it out way out on the coast ... Do we want to hear this story ? No , we got on the roof . We slept on the roof that night , the first night . And Brianna was not there . I just saw a shooting star . We got to take that as a good sign , guys . There 's a lot of them tonight . You know it would only take one about six miles wide to wipe out life on Earth . - Hmm . - Thanks . " The stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth . " Oh , no . The Bible , hon ? You think they have any idea what 's going on ? No . Do you ? Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's just things are bad enough , you know ? I don 't think you need to go quoting the Bible . What was that ? It was the book of Revelations . - Yeah . - End of days . Exactly . Oh . Brianna 's out there . We 'll find her . Well , look , I ... You know , I didn 't want to tell you this , but some of the research that I was doing last night ... I discovered that there are some native nations and some cultures that have a demon called a skinwalker . It 's like a kind of pure spirit . It can do no harm on its own , but when it takes possession of a human body , it can do horrible things . If the body dies , then it flees . - Really ? - Look , I know . I know . But think about what we saw with the camper ... the thing that happened to Brianna . I mean , there 's some truth in these ancient myths . What you 're saying ... There 's a lot more than some truth . According to the myth , the skinwalkers were locked within the Earth , and only a great earthquake could set them free at the end time . Come on , now . The fever driving everyone crazy ? There 's supposed to be a plague at the end . Yeah ... you 're also supposed to hear trumpets , right ? I mean , I remember that from Sunday school . You hear trumpets ? No , no trumpets . Neither do I. Yeah . So , until we hear trumpets , why don 't we ... deal with our problems ... that are right in front of us ? Get to Yakima ... and get our daughter . Yes , we will . You are entering a quarantine zone . Please remain calm ... You will be medically examined . Stay in your vehicle until instructed to exit by a designated ... Straight line , folks . Leave all bags and personal effects in your vehicle . There are no ... Let 's go . Out of the vehicle now . Let 's go . Now . Out . Let 's go . - Everybody ? - Yes , please . Out . Come on , kids . Let 's go . Right here . Let 's go . Let 's go . Let 's go . Any irrational behavior ? Any panicking and violence ? Yeah , we 've seen a lot . No , I mean your family . Any fever ? Anyone sick ? - No , no fever . - No . Don 't want fever in the city . Open . Hey , what are you doing ? Sir ? Take off your glasses , please . Open . Blood in the mouth is the only symptom of this ... plague . We have orders to shoot anyone with blood in the mouth on sight . You 're clear . Open . Open . Nothing . Okay , you people are good to go . We 're missing our daughter . We got separated from her . Is there a reunification place in Yakima at all ? Do you know ? Yeah , Yakima Valley Community College . You 're coming in from the south , so get off at Nob Hill , west of 16th . - Feverheads ! - Feverheads ! - Clear ! - Clear ! Clear ! - Feverheads . - Feverheads ? The government 's keeping you safe , folks . I hope you find your daughter . You 're good to go . All right , everyone in . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Bye ! Thanks , Little Mike ! Thank you so much ! _ _ Guys , she made it . She made it ! Yes . Yes ! - She 's on the other side of town . - What 's it say ? She 's on the north side . " Almost there . " - In Yakima ? - Yeah . Yes . Look . Dad , look . It 's gonna hit the city . We have to get out of here . Drive ! Not without Brianna . Dad , drive ! What is all this ? Looks a lot like the end of the world . We have to face it . I 'm ... I 'm ... - That 's not true , Matt . - I 'm not gonna accept that . We survived it . Why wouldn 't she ? She 's alive . How do you know ? 'Cause I know . Hey , Karen . You got to believe , okay ? You got to believe . It 's okay . What is that ? It sounds like ... Don 't say it . Just don 't . Next time on " Aftermath " ... - Hey ! - Leave her ! Some kind of brain disease ... I don 't know . Stay the hell away , and don 't get infected . We 're gonna find her the same way we did before . You know family doesn 't matter anymore , right ? They are spirits that can possess a person . What if he 's one of those ... What did you call them , skinwalkers ? Yeah . There is a body in there , a dead body . Mom ? Matt ! Show yourself !

 Previously ... Someone tried to poison me . For you , Madonna . It will change color in the presence of poison . If St. Germain is behind this , we need to connect him to the gang , Les Disciples . - There 's nothing in here . - Look again , Madonna . - How did you do that ? - A little sleight of hand . Apostle spoons . Christening gift for the bairn . Monsieur Forez confided to me that he 's preparing for multiple executions . You 're in danger , Master Raymond . You can 't kill Randall . It would be as if you 're killing Frank , too . A year , not one day more . Milord got into a fight with an English officer . You promised . Jamie ! Claire ! Look , Mama . What a pretty bird . Let me see . That is a pretty bird , isn 't it ? What kind of bird is this ? That is a heron . - Have you ever seen one in real life ? - Yes , I have . - Where ? - In Scotland . When were you in Scotland , Mama ? A long time ago . Claire ? Be still , my child . My baby . I am here . We will take care of you . - Jamie . - Monsieur Forez is working . - My baby ... - You must stay quiet . You must . I am here . Where 's my baby ? Where is my baby ? Chère Madame , do not trouble yourself . - You must save your strength . - Where 's my baby ? I don 't want any water . I ... I want my baby . I am sorry , Madame . She has joined the angels . She was ... No . No . It 's not possible . I want my baby . Bring me my baby . Bring me my baby . Bring me my baby ! I want my baby ! Where is she now ? I baptized her . And gave her a name . Faith . You must understand , it is illegal unless the child is living . But I wanted her to be buried in hallowed ground . This , ma chère , will stay between you , me , and God . Mère Hildegarde ... This is Father Laurentin . It is customary to perform an unction of the sick , my child . It has been several days now . Your fever is very high . It is wise to prepare the soul . I need my husband . I 'm sorry , ma chère , there has been no word . My sins are all I have left . Amen . Amen . Be still now . Jamie ... Hush , Madonna . If they find me here , I 'm finished . Master Raymond . Tell me what you see , Madonna . Wings . Blue wings . Blue with the color of healing . The wings will carry your pain away , if you let them . A white hotness burned deep in my bones . I knew what it was . Puerperal fever . The baby had come , but part of the placenta had not . It festered inside my womb . But as Raymond 's hands moved over the meridians of my body , I could feel the tiny deaths of the bacteria that inhabited my blood . Small explosions as each scintilla of infection disappeared . The fever drained from my bones ... and my tortured body relaxed gratefully into the frame of his hands , melting and reforming like molded wax . Call him . Call to him . Jamie ! I don 't know what he did or how he did it ... but he healed me . Once more , he saved my life . Madame ? I must go now . Be well , Madonna . I am no Madonna . I have no child . I didn 't call you Madonna because you were with child , my dear . Everyone has a color about them ... all around them like a cloud . Yours is blue . Like the Virgin 's cloak . Like my own . You shouldn 't have come . It 's too dangerous . You were right about the king . He wants blood now . But these are things you do for your friends . Will I ever see you again ? As I told you before , we will see each other again . Mère , has there been any word from Monsieur Fraser ? He is unable to come , Madame . He was arrested for dueling with the English captain , and is being detained in the Bastille Saint-Antoine . For how long ? Dueling is a serious offense . I 'm afraid your husband will remain in prison at the king 's pleasure . If your husband had killed his opponent , the penalty would have been much worse . He 's not dead ? The English captain ? He is badly wounded , and the British ambassador begged for him to be allowed to recover from his injuries in England . So , Jack Randall was still alive . The cat with nine lives . And thus , so was Frank . But at what cost ? That is fortunate , no ? Yes . Fortunate . But my husband betrayed me , Mother . Revenge mattered more to him than me ... or his child . How so ? One year of grace ... is all I asked . To which he agreed . One year . He may as well have run his sword through me . God says we must revel in mercy . Tread sins underfoot ... and hurl iniquities into the sea . I 'm not sure there 's a sea deep enough . I laid in that bed for weeks . My body had healed . My soul had not . One day Fergus came . He brought flowers and asked me to come home . I 'd lost my husband and my child . Where else could I go ? Welcome home ... Milady . Thank you , Magnus . Thank you , Fergus . That was nice . What is it ? Nothing , Milady . No ! What is he doing ? Stop ! Fergus ? Wake up . It 's just a bad dream . Do you want to tell me about it ? No . No , Milady . Might make you feel better . It 's not just a dream . What is it ? The Englishman , Milady . What Englishman ? Fergus , tell me . I ... I went with Milord to Maison Elise . Prince Charles owed money . He told me to wait . Milord told me to stay put , but I have a talent for stealing and I couldn 't resist . One of the rooms was open ... and I saw a bottle of perfume there . I wanted to bring it to Milady as a gift . It smelled so nice . I put it in my pocket . I kept the bottle , but ... but I was too afraid to give it to you after what happened . It 's lavender , Milady . When I turned around ... he was there . The Englishman . You 're not what I ordered . But ... no , you 'll do . Jesus Christ . I tried to get away , I swear I did . I told him Milord was there , but he wouldn 't listen . He said that ... he wanted me to ... I can 't say it in front of a lady . Stop ! Why didn 't you tell me this sooner ? I wanted to , but ... but I was ashamed . - It 's all right , Fergus . - No ! No , it 's not . It 's all my fault . I should have kept quiet . I didn 't cry or scream at first , but ... I couldn 't help it . Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Milord ! Milord heard it and ... and he came running . Milord ! I hid under the dressing table . Get off ! Then the fight was broken up . As soon as Milord was taken away ... I heard him challenge the Englishman to a duel . You sick bastard ! A duel ! I demand a duel ! No ! And then he was taken away . It 's not your fault , Fergus . I didn 't know . I didn 't know he would go to fight the Englishman . I didn 't know . And now Milord is gone . He will never come back . Come here . It 's all right . A private audience with the king ? You have mentioned you are the goddaughter of the old Sun King . Surely you have an entrée or know someone who does . It is possible . I wish to petition for my husband 's release from the Bastille . So , ma chère , you have found a deep enough sea . I learned the reason he broke his promise . I was angry at him . Still am . But he is the father of my child . His Majesty is a mercurial man . There is a price to such requests . Which is ? The king may expect to lie with you . If it comes to sacrificing my virtue , Mother ... I 'll add it to the list of things I have already lost in Paris . Your Majesty ... I present to you Madame Claire Fraser , Lady Broch Tuarach . No . Now , tell me what it is that I may do for you . My husband is in the Bastille . For dueling . Your husband has broken a royal decree . I understand that . But he was provoked . As you know , he is a Scot . They are most fierce where questions of their honor are concerned . Quite so . Quite so , Madame . - However ... - I would be most grateful ... Your Majesty . Is this his ring ? Yes , Sire . And this other one ? I was married once before . And yet you still wear his ring . Your loyalty is most noteworthy . I am inclined towards mercy ... ma chère Madame . But ... He was called Louis the Well-Beloved . His rule was absolute . He could free Jamie with a word , or kill him . He could do with me as he liked . I waited to see what His Majesty 's pleasure might be . Tell me , if I was to grant your request to free your husband ... would you be inclined to grant me a small favor in return ? I am at Your Majesty 's complete disposal . Come . So pale . So fine . I can see why they call you La Dame Blanche . The king asks that you give us the benefit of your skills . When I saw Monsieur Forez , the king 's executioner , I knew his presence could mean only one thing : there would be death here today . I 'm not sure what you mean , Sire . Maitre Raymond et Comte St. Germain : We have no quarrel with the proper search for wisdom . But while much good may be found , so , too , may evil be discovered , and the search for wisdom be perverted into the desire for power and wealth for one 's own depraved and immoral purpose . The White Lady . Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ . I beseech you to use your talents . Look into their souls . And if there is darkness within ... they will be handed over to Monsieur Forez and put to death . It will be an honor ... to assist Your Majesty in this task . Very well . Let us commence . I see a shadow ... behind your eyes , Comte . I see an image . A gang of men in the street ... dressed as aristocrats , but wearing masks . There is a name in your mind , Monsieur ... Les Disciples . What do you know of Les Disciples , Monsieur ? I know nothing of these " Disciples " of which you speak . You are lying , sir . I am not lying . I am not lying ! I am not lying , Sire ! This woman is a liar and a witch . This woman has also been known to drink poison and survive . And how do you come to this knowledge ? Because I gave her the poison myself . She tried to ruin my livelihood . She had my ship destroyed with her false condemnations . She is a witch . And she doesn 't deny it . No . I don 't deny it . La Dame Blanche is a white witch ... and I practice ... white magic , Sire . Madame Fraser ... is not on trial here . Even knowing St. Germain tried to poison me , I found it hard to condemn him cold-bloodedly to death . I see darkness in his soul . Also in his . But only the normal darkness that lives in the souls of ... all men . Even a king 's . For without darkness ... there can be no light . Nevertheless , if I am to cleanse this city , I must make an example . Perhaps we can aid your decision . The Bible claims that a true believer can handle serpents and they will not harm him , for they are the servants of God . Perhaps , Your Majesty ... I may suggest another test . It is true I drank the Comte 's poison and it did not kill me . Let him drink mine and see what happens . Let them both drink it . With your permission ? Very well . I decided to take a page out of Master Raymond 's book , so to speak . I looked through the evidence , the remnants from his shop and found the herb I was looking for . Bitter cascara . I knew the cascara would make both men ill , but wouldn 't kill them . And perhaps Louis , having had his show , would be appeased and set them free . This potion will give you your answers , Sire . We may have a death . Or two . But I ask one thing : If both these men survive ... you will set them free . We shall see if it pleases the king . I never saw Raymond add anything to it . No one had . It was another amazing feat , a sleight of hand like the one he 'd shown me in his shop . Give him the cup . Hand it to him . All I knew was that this time , inside the cup , was death . St. Germain knew it too . Well ... Perhaps it was the shock of what I 'd been through , but as Master Raymond was led away , what ran through my brain was a line from a film . You know the one . " I 'm going to miss you most of all . " Your Majesty will honor my request ? First , there 's still a matter of the payment . I closed my eyes ... and thought of England . I will issue a pardon for your husband and arrange one with the English crown should you wish to return to Scotland . I don 't even know if it was a boy ... or a girl . Claire ? Will ye make me beg ? It was a girl . Mother Hildegarde baptized her . Gave her a name . Faith . Mother Hildegarde has a very odd sense of humor . She 's buried in the cemetery , next to the convent . I did try to keep my promise . Fergus told me what happened . Then ye see how I couldna let Randall go unpunished for what he did to the wee lad ? Do ye hate me for it , Claire ? I did hate you . Mother Hildegarde let me see her ... so I wouldn 't have to imagine . She was beautiful . So small . I could cup her head in the palm of my hand . The ears stuck out just a little . You could see the light through them . And the light through her skin as well . Like ... the light on a pearl ... that 's still wet from the sea . Her eyes were closed . No lashes yet . They were slanted a bit , like yours . She had wisps of the most ... beautiful copper hair . Oh , I do like to be Beside the seaside Oh , I do like to be Beside the sea I like to walk along Prom , Prom , Prom So just let me be beside the sea How long has it been ? Since this morning . Ma chère Claire . She 's beautiful , isn 't she ? Ten fingers . Ten toes . She 's an angel . May I hold her ? So , yes ... I hated you . Aye . But ... it was me ... who asked the impossible of you . It was me that put Frank before our family . It was me ... who followed you to the woods . Frank is your family too . But he 's not here . And now , neither is our daughter . It 's not your fault . It 's not even Randall 's fault , not this time . It 's my fault . I asked your forgiveness once . You said there 's nothing to forgive . Truth is ... I already forgave you ... long before today . For this and anything else you could ever do . There is something else . I slept with the king . To buy your freedom . You did it to save my life . Just like I gave myself to Randall to save you . How can we ever be the same ? No , we can 't be . The weight of what has happened here is ... too much for any one of us to bear alone . The only way we can live with it is to carry it ... together . Are you sure you want to do that ? We lost our child . But by the grace of God , we may be given another . Then bring me home . To Scotland . Aye . Scotland . But there 's something I 'd like to do first . St. Andrew . If we must bury you here in France ... let 's leave a bit of Scotland wi ' ye .

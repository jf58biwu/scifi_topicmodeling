 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... I 've been waiting a long time for a face-to-face . There 's a stretch of time in there that 's unaccounted for when no one was in contact . - They switched people out . - The plan worked . We have replaced the top operatives at S.H.I.E.L.D. - How many ? - All of them . 4x15 - Self Control ♪ Now you know how nice it feels ♪ ♪ Scatter good seed in the fields ♪ ♪ Life 's ours for the making ♪ Studies show music increases dopamine levels by 9 % . So I picked a recording that seemed to be one of your favorites . I always imagined this would be good music to be born to ... not ... the other thing . I didn 't bring you here to die . - I 'm going to save you . - I 'm not afraid to go . One of my prime directives is to protect the Framework . - And I need you alive to do that . - No ! I don 't want to live as a festering cripple . And you better not be talking about messing with my brain . I don 't want to be a thing like you . Don 't worry . You 'll be many things . We have to get out of here . No , Jemma , we have to be careful . They can 't know that we know . But we can only imagine what the Russian and Radcliffe programmed them to do . They could kill us , or they could ... they ... Okay , okay , okay . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . If they wanted to , they would have already . Unless they 're waiting to separate us from the general population , - then kill us or switch us or ... - Okay . Okay , okay . Take a breath , take a breath . It 's okay . The one advantage we have over them is they don 't know that we 're on to them . Yeah . But they 're gonna be suspicious if we don 't act normal . Right . Yeah . Maybe we could ask someone who wasn 't on the op ... - Agent Fitz . - Yes , Coulson , sir . We haven 't been able to locate the submarine on satellite . In your best estimation , do you think it has missile-launch capabilities ? Well , we couldn 't know that for sure , but one could posit that , yeah . Mm . Then we 'll have to assume the worst . That the Russian has people to enact his endgame . And his goal in life was to kill all Inhumans . That 's why we 're bringing them all here , to headquarters . Of course . Makes perfect sense . Uh , well , once this storm has cleared up , uh , and the Director has fully recovered , we can start to put a system together to ... I 've recovered enough . - My God , that was fast . - A little sore , but I 'll manage . I think Daisy here should contact the Inhumans personally - and oversee their transfer to H.Q. - I 'll take care of it . I 'll help make calls . That 's our top priority . Along with finding Agent May , right ? Of course . Well , perhaps Simmons and I should retire to my office and , uh , discuss the logistics of the search . Actually , we ... y ... f ... discovered an old U.S.S.R. communication hardware device , um , on the raid . Maybe they used that for communicating . But we should probably keep a brain trust together until we can decipher the code . Good idea . Time 's a-wasting . Let 's get to it . We need to scan and replace those last two immediately . Carefully , undetected . We 're still outnumbered here . Not for long . In the meantime , Daisy will contact the Inhumans , inform them she 's coming to collect them personally . Yes . And then execute them on sight . Which reminds me , the hardware we brought from the Russian 's loading dock ... Still in the shipping container on Zephyr One . I 'll oversee it 's off-loaded down into the basement now . Yo-Yo 's our most-valuable asset , so we want to get to her first . Sounds like the right idea . Yo-Yo , we 're coming to get you . Is everything okay ? You 're in danger . I have so many memories of snow . My first time ice-skating on my neighbor 's pond . A month stationed near the French Alps . But the truth is ... this is the first time I 've seen it . My phantom limb used to ache in cold weather . But now ... I don 't feel that pain . I haven 't felt this good in years . What are you saying ? No . Oh , God , no . - What did Radcliffe do ? - May , it 's okay . This is why I 'm locked up in here ! - Hey . - You 're not afraid of what I 'll do . - It 's okay . - You 're afraid that they 'll discover you ! We can help them , too . May , this is a good thing . - This is a very good thing . - How can you possibly think that ? ! I get it . My programming is different than yours . You had to discover that your body had been replaced . - You must 've felt blindsided . - My reality was crashing down . Whereas I still have my mind but know exactly what I am . And more importantly , I understand a basic truth that you don 't realize yet . And what 's that ? That our bodies don 't matter . Radcliffe built a world ... a world exactly like this one . Every molecular detail the same , just ... with a little less hurt for each of us . What do you mean , " hurt " ? Imagine if your greatest regret could be wiped away . Do you know what that would be ? I do . And you ? I sometimes wonder what it would 've been like if I 'd never signed up . All the loss , the grief ... All my regrets are piled up after that . Could 've lived like a civilian , you know ? The simple life . Now we can have that . Are you saying we 'll eventually be able to be ... together ? I 'm saying that in the Framework , we already are . Radcliffe gassed them during the raid . That 's why we lost time . Quick scan of the brain , transfer that data to a body , which must have already been built ... Yeah , I 'm thinking the same thing . He could 've had ... Sorry . Could 've had digital scans of their features . From the eyes of the May android . Complete physical geometry . So he could 've replaced anybody . - What is ... - Let me see . Well , the ... lab techs must 've taken it upon themselves to mount LMD detection devices randomly throughout the base . I mean , there must be a calibration error . It 's reading the equipment or something ... - Whoa ! - Stay right there . - Hey , Jemma ... - Back away ! - Back away ... - All right ! ... until we can f-figure this out . Figure what out ? You 're pointing a gun at me . Why are you pointing a gun at me ? ! - No . - Don 't move . It 's you . S-S-Shut up . Shut up ! You suggested that we come to the workshop ... alone . You brought me here . No , you ... you were ... you were the one telling me to act normal , and ... - You knew how the LMDs were made . - ... who was the one that didn 't want to leave the base , saying it was a calibration error ? ! - You knew ! - There 's no calibration error ! I 'm not the one that 's pointing the gun ! I bloody well know that I 'm not an android ! You would lie and say that if you were ! You 'd be programmed to ! What are you doing ? You don 't know . You don 't even know , like May . Stop it ! The ... The same goes for you . Of course this is happening . This always happens to you , to me , to us . It 's my worst fear coming true again . You don 't even know . I 'm not a bloody LMD ! You 're messing with me , messing with my head ! - It 's not me , Jemma ! - Well , it 's one of us ! It 's one of us , Fitz . Well , regardless of who it is ... - it 's my fault . - It is . - It is . - I perfected the technology . I started this whole nightmare . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Don 't ... make me feel bad for you . - Don 't hurt me . - I couldn 't . I 'm not gonna fight you , Jemma . Even if you are a decoy . I 'm the bad guy , okay ? No matter what . So I 'll do whatever you say . Okay ? I 'll do whatever you say . Pick it up . - And do what , Jemma ? - Cut your wrist . If you 're the LMD , I 'll see your substructure and I 'll know . And if not ... Not , then you 're the android , and you just convinced - me to slit my wrist . - Do it ! Okay . Ohh ! - That 's a lot of blood . - Did you cut the radial artery ? I was trying very hard to miss it . I ... Don 't come near me ! Oh , God . - Fitz ... - I 'm sorry . - Welcome back , Doctor . - Oh , what the hell ? My orders were to bring me out after 24 hours . - That 's exactly what I did . - Really ? Oh , my God . I completely lost track of time . Aida , there were ... changes . I had to restart the simulation to accommodate the new residents . In order to reduce their pain , to fix a regret for each of them , I had to restart the Framework simulation - from those moments in time . - Are you mad ? I am programmed to do just that . You shouldn 't have done that with me plugged in . I could 've lost my grip on reality ! To the human mind , there 's no difference between the perception of the Framework and the physical world . It ... It 's just so vast . This is all ... - perfectly real . - I assure you , one of my prime directives is keeping you safe . The other is to protect the Framework . Protect the Framework , yes , which is why we 've given that Russki all that he wants ... so that he 'll guarantee the Framework has this palace to operate within . The Russian , he 's , uh ... he 's in good spirits ? He 's resting . Four LMDs are in place at S.H.I.E.L.D. And it 's only a matter of time before they get brain scans of the top remaining agents ... Jemma and , of course , Daisy . Are their commands working on a subconscious level to avoid detection , as with Agent May ? There wasn 't time for such subtleties . They 're much more ... objective-driven . Aida , people could be killed in that scenario . Only if they resist . Okay . That 's everyone . Do you really think it 's necessary for me to personally greet each of them ? You don 't think that 'll take too much time ? It 'll be more efficient than you think . Okay . I 'll suit up . - Zephyr in 10 ? - I 'll be ready . I need you conscious to map your frontal lobe , so you can 't be too heavily sedated . The rest you can sleep through . You have Fitz 's mind . Why are you doing this ? I 'm doing it for you . For us . What we 've always suspected I now know to be true . Consciousness is separate from the physical self . Don 't hurt yourself , Jemma . There 's no reason to be afraid . I was always trying to protect you , pursuing technological solves to the problematic scenario that you could be harmed or killed . But Radcliffe 's cured death . Once I map your brain , we 'll never have to fear losing each other again . Don 't fight , Jemma . You 're too weak . I 'm securing our future . So we can get married , grow old together . That 's the first time you 've mentioned it ... getting married . I mean ... I 've thought about it . But I was afraid to bring it up . You know ... I thought I knew your answer , but no one 's ever 100 % . I 'll tell Fitz when I see him . No . No ! No ! No ! No ! Aah ! Jemma , please ! Stop ! Jemma , Jemma , look at me . Look at me . Stop . It 's me . It 's me . Prince , where 's Agent Johnson ? Yeah , Daisy told me to tell you she wants to check the accommodations for the incoming Inhumans before we head out . - The containment rooms downstairs ? - Yeah . Damn it . Code 3 , West Sector . Repeat ... Code 3 , West Sector . - It 's Agent Fitz , sir . - We can see that . Davis said Agent Simmons was the only one in here with him . Then it 's what we feared . We believe Agent Simmons has been compromised , replaced with an LMD . - We need to find her , scan her ... - No , wait . Look . - My God . - Sir , we have to scan everyone . Daisy knows , and she got away . Damn it . This is not how it was supposed to go . - We didn 't want bloodshed . - It 's too late for that . Mack , see if you can patch up Fitz enough so that he can fix himself . - We have to search the base . - And cut the security feeds . Already gave the order . - Get away from me ! - Simmons . What the literal hell ? What did I just see ? What just happened to Fitz ? It wasn 't him . It wasn 't him . Did you kill him ? No , not " him . " It wasn 't him . Are you a robot ? Because I just saw a truckload of myself , and Mack is in on it . And Coulson just bashed an agent 's head in and ... They were all replaced ... you , too . It 's not you . It 's not you ! Simmons ... it 's me . What about you ? Prove to me that you 're not a frickin ' robot . Because it looks like you 're malfunctioning . No way to prove it . You won 't know until they kill you . There 's no way to know until they kill you . Okay . Give me ... Give me your hand . I 'll quake you . - Don 't touch me ! - Give me your hand ! I 'll quake you , not to hurt you ! Not to hurt you . Just enough to feel your bones ... the ... the real bones , and they 're not made of metal . I 'm me . I hope . I 'm not one of them . I can prove to you that I 'm not one , either . An LMD wouldn 't have Inhuman powers , right ? That way , we 'll both know . Don 't touch me ! Oh , thank God . There 's a beauty to it . This body you 're building ... the Russian won 't approve . He 'll come around . I 've observed his behavior . I 've observed much human behavior . And the more I see , the harder it gets to find a logic to it . Oh , you sweet girl , there is no logic to love , anger , wonder , joy ... I understand the concepts , but I don 't feel them myself . And unfortunately ... they 've created a paradox in my programming . What do you mean ? Explain . My two main parameters are in opposition due to human emotions . I was programmed to protect the Framework but also to preserve your life above all others . Well , how is that a contradiction ? Because the greatest threat to the Framework , Doctor ... is you . Well , that 's simply not accurate . A defining human trait seems to be regret , or so I 've observed . You even asked me to repair one regret for each person entering the Framework . Yes . Well , you , Doctor , exhibit poor self-control , and if you someday come to regret building the Framework , you could change my parameters and have me dismantle it . Why would you think I would ever do that ? I am saving these people . I am giving them a replica of their life - with less pain . - Yes . But their physical bodies will eventually give out because of it . Oh , Aida , that doesn 't matter . Reality is just perception . They perceive it as real , which makes it real . They might not believe that . Yeah , but I do . I know it . I believe it to be true , wholeheartedly . Thank you for clarifying . That statement fixes the paradox . I can now solve both problems at once . Shh . You 'll live a long life , free of pain . We know you 're wondering why you 're here . You 've received orders . Base is on a complete lockdown . Agent Coulson will explain why . Two of our best agents and friends , Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons , have been kidnapped . And worse than that , they 've been replaced . What do you mean , " hope " ? They 'll say we 're Life Model Decoys , turn all of HQ against us , and have us killed . Okay . Well ... maybe there 's not a lot of hope that we 're gonna get out of here , but there is hope ... that our team is still alive . Which means we have to try . From what Fitz told you , it seems Radcliffe , in his ... twisted logic , is keeping them alive in this Framework thing . Which means they can be rescued . How ? The Framework 's origin signal is untraceable . They could be anywhere on the planet . Which is why we have to go in . - You mean ... go in ? Hack in ... - Hack in . Plug ourselves into the Framework so we can find our people , and we can wake them up and figure out where their bodies are being kept . I don 't know . Really , what 's our other option ? Shoot to maim ... stomach , spine . It 's imperative we pull the data from their heads . Don 't let their faces cloud your judgment . The best way to ensure that we can save them is to find these machines pretending to be them and take them down . Eyes and ears open , people . Let 's move . So , we fight our way through the trained military personnel , then the ultra-powerful android doubles of our friends , somehow make it to the Zephyr , which we can 't fly , to escape the base and try to plug our minds into an alternate reality . Okay , well , don 't say it out loud , because that made it sound way worse . Let 's just keep it one thing at a time , okay ? We have sleeping gas . How many doses of that antidote are there ? I don 't know ... I can 't think without Fitz . Simmons . Simmons , stay with me . We can 't fight them , Daisy . It 's too much . - It 's all too much . - Hey , hey . Don 't worry about fighting them , okay ? I will . I will take them on myself . No , Daisy , don 't do this . You don 't have your - gauntlets to protect your arms . - It doesn 't matter . Look , I know you still feel like you have to atone for Lincoln 's sacrifice , but sacrificing yourself is not the answer . That is not what this is about . - I can 't lose you , too ! - Look at me . Look at me . This is not a sacrifice play . You know why ? Because I will beat them . You hear me ? I know it . If for no other reason than this ... through all the insane crap we have gone through , the one thing I 've known , without a doubt , the whole time ... is you and Fitz belong together . This is not how your story ends . Okay ? So I 'm gonna beat the screws out of those junkers , and the two of us are gonna get the hell out of Dodge . - Deal ? - Deal . Agent Fitz is in critical condition . He might survive , but it gives us an idea what these two capable of . - They 're gassing the agents . - Smart . We should kill the lights . They can 't see in the dark as well as we can . And I 'll get Agent May ready for the contingency plan . Explosives ? They trying to bring the roof down on us ? Is that it ? No . That 's not it . What 's going on down there ? Is everyone okay ? It 's time for you to enter the fight . You 're our last line of defense . What do you want me to do ? - You guys all right ? - There 's still gas everywhere . How are we awake ? - Daisy and I aren 't the LMDs . - I don 't buy it . I don 't care . Now get up . Really ? Not even winded ? We don 't want to hurt you . That 's not what it feels like . Daisy , this is for your own good . We didn 't want to hurt you , but we have no choice here . Now let us download you before you bleed out . Don 't resist us . You 'll be fine . We 're in this together . We 're a team . I would say I told you so , but ... I don 't have to now . Okay , okay . Anyone here know how to fly the Zephyr ? - I-I just started training . - Okay . Well , you 're gonna try real hard . You three can walk better than we can , so drag any unconscious bodies out of this sector before the fire spreads , then open the hangar doors and meet us on the Zephyr . Daisy and I will load in this hardware . And remember , anyone you see who 's awake ... Is a robot . Super . Come on . I need medical . Coulson , I have them . May , think about what you 're doing . I am . Or ... processing , I should say . Please . Do you want us to die ? Coulson says that doesn 't matter . That doesn 't sound like Coulson . Either way ... I won 't have to regret this decision . - This 'll take a while . - Worry about Mack later . Can you program the Daisy fleet downstairs with basic seek-and-destroy ? - Of course . - Do it . Be ready to release them . I thought you said you had them . May ? What did you do ? What I wanted to . Okay . Everything 's under control . - Let 's just ... - Whose control ? Why don 't you and I have a glass of Scotch ... or many ... and talk this out , like we always do ? " We " ? We 've never done that before . No , no , keep going ! You were right . Our programming is different . Are you afraid to die ? 'Cause I am . I know I 'm not real . I 'm all phantom limbs . But that doesn 't make the pain less real . You don 't have to feel pain . You say you don 't anymore . But that pain , that regret ... that 's what made you a person ... a person I love . - Start engine . - Ignition on . - Go , go , go ! - Top right . Move it ! Top right . Come on , go , go , go , go , go ! My programming was to get the Darkhold . That came from Radcliffe . But my impulse , to keep Coulson safe and close , that desire ... - that came from me . - That 's good . And I 'm sorry to say ... you 're not him . What we can decipher from the insane amount of code flying around in there is that it 's a duplicate of our world . Populated with all the people in the world . - How could they build ... - The Darkhold . _ We 've managed to identify the duplicate avatars of myself and Daisy that are running around in there . So you just plug yourself into these avatars ? Hook up with our people and find out where on Earth - their bodies are being held . - And rescue them . That sounds easy . Will it be easy ? They have no idea . And if they 're in there too long , their bodies will ... give out . - Well , that 's the hypothesis . - So we have to go ... now . Meet at the rendezvous right away . That 's where I programmed the backdoor to get out . And listen , living in there too long may kill you , but dying in there will definitely kill you , so ... be careful . You , too . And remember , even if our vitals are going haywire , do not ... Do not pull you out or wake you up , I know . It will cook your brains like huevos rotos . Cause permanent damage to the cerebral cortex , yes . Just promise me you 'll get our guys back , okay ? I promise . Wake up your boyfriend . We 're being called in . Lincoln ? ♪ Now you know how nice it feels ♪ ♪ Scatter good seed in the fields ♪ ♪ Life 's ours for the making ♪ ♪ Eternity 's waiting ♪ ♪ Waiting for you and me ♪ ♪ Now you know that you are real ♪ ♪ Show your friends that you and me ♪ ♪ Belong to the same world ♪ ♪ Turned on to the same word ♪ ♪ Have you heard ? ♪ ♪ Have you heard ? ♪ ♪ Have you heard ? ♪ ♪ Have you heard ? ♪ ♪ Have you heard ? ♪ ♪ Hmm , hmm ♪ ♪ Hmm-mm-mm ♪ ♪ Mm-mm ♪ See ? Good as new . - And stronger , it seems . - I know what you did . You stole my mind and uploaded it to a filthy machine . I told you not to mess with my mind . I assure you ... your mind is alive and well inside your head . Untouched . - This body is mechanical , yes . - What ? You 're controlling it remotely . Some reading , if you 're interested . I need you walking around , able to continue protecting the Framework . A perfect machine , controlled with a mind endowed with the ability to feel love , anger , wonder ... joy . Joy ? When ? When I am able to feel those things myself .

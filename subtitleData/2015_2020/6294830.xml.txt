 Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits ... Go ! ... pitting us against one another . Chester 's Mill sentences Dale Barbara to death . ... and forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons ... rage ... I need to know that you will stand with me against that ! ... grief ... I don 't understand who could do this to her ? I promise you , we 're going to catch whoever did this . - ... fear ... - We 're trapped . I hear we 're going to run out of water . You killed Angie McAlister . ... shame . I thought it would bring the dome down . I would do anything to take it back . But we 've also found love under the dome . And we have battled to keep our town together . I thought the dome was supposed to protect us . No , it 's up to us to protect each other . Now we may finally have found a way out . We hope it takes us home , but what if it takes us to an alternate reality ? Follow me . We 're going home . What do you mean , going home ? It 's time to move on . - Melanie . - Barbie . We can 't leave Julia . Julia said it was up to me to lead everybody out . So you 're just gonna leave her here ? She knows that I 'm coming back for her . Look , it 's like she says . Sometimes you just got to take a leap of faith . Into nothingness . Looks better than staying in here . All right , let 's go . Everybody stick together . Joe ! Norrie ! Melanie ! We 're going home . It 's time to move on . Move on . Where are we ? - How did we get here ? - Where are we ? Everyone here ? I know . I-I have no idea . - You okay ? - I 'm fine . Hey , where 's Melanie ? I don 't know . I-I didn 't see her . Did you hear her voice ? What is that ? We 're outside the dome . Look . - Do you see that ? - It 's changing . It 's ... it 's going up . Where 's it going ? It 's changing . - What is it ? - I can 't tell . Take my hand . My God , it 's gone . You okay ? Julia . Junior . Julia ! I 'm here . Just like I promised . I came back for you . 3x01 / 02 - Move On / But I 'm Not Hunter , Jawbreaker 2-3 , we 're less than a klick out . Got you covered , boss . Got a drone over the location , no activity in the surrounding area . All right , on me . Everybody remember we 're running a standard exfil protocol . Intel has those hostages guarded by a small group of insurgents . All right , that door 's our entrance point . That 's where they 're holding ' em . There 's no one here ! Target 's a ghost ! Yeah , I got ten hostiles coming your way ... they came out of nowhere . You 're good . Catch your breath . Hunter , talk to me ! Rooftops are clean . Let me know if that changes ! Drop it ! Drop it ! Drop it ! Now , get down ! - I surrender ! - Get down ! I surrender , okay ? ! I surrender ! Thank you , sir . Thank you . For what ? I got six rounds in this magazine . All of ' em are dummies except for one . Wasn 't those . Where 's the hostages ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I 'm only gonna ask you two more times . If you 're lucky . Where 's the hostages ? I beg you ... Last chance . Okay , okay , okay . I tell you . T ... Textile factory . Guards . Five . Six-six . You play games ? W-Why , why ? I tell you . No ! You got provisions ready to move ? Yes , we do , sir . Got two more units heading down , sir . Watch your step , ma 'am . Like Steven Seagal in his aptly-titled 1990 classic , you are hard to kill . Trust me , it ain 't from lack of trying . I 'm glad you 're back safe . Drink later ? No , man , I 'm beat . Another time ? Yeah . I don 't know how to thank you . Just doing what you hired me to do . Yeah , well , hiring you might be the only good decision I 've made as operations manager here . It 's a tough job , trying to make the world a safer place . You know , my part 's easy . Just stop the bad guys from making your job harder . Occupational hazard . I 'm gonna go get cleaned up . You want to talk about it ? Talk about what ? Whatever you had to do to save my people , it was worth it . Dale . You don 't have to hide who you are . I want it all , good and bad . You sure about that ? Sometimes I don 't know what side 's gonna come out on top . I know . Who 's it from ? Joe . Again . Don 't you think that you should text him back ? I think we should get some sleep . Julia ! I 'm here . Just like I promised . I came back for you . You were saying her name again . I 'm sorry . Don 't apologize . It was traumatic , what you went through . But you 've been having this dream for almost a year now . Maybe it 'd be a good idea for you to go back to Chester 's Mill for the memorial . So you can move on . Barbie ! Barbie ! Where are you ? ! Barbie 's not coming back for us . He will . You 'll see . You heard that rumbling . Maybe the tunnels caved in on them . - Maybe everyone 's ... - Shut up . I don 't want to hear it . We need to get across , find out where they are . They can 't be far ... they were just in front of us . If something 's wrong , we 'll help them . All right . How ? We can get a ladder at the school . Pick up some flashlights . What is it ? My father . Jim 's not the priority right now . We need to get the supplies and get back here , fast . Great . Flares ? Just in case . In case we get lost at sea ? Let 's go . Cat get stuck up in a tree ? Should 've killed me while you had a chance , Junior . Jim , you 've got to let us go . Yeah ? Why 's that ? You got a hair appointment ? Them roots are looking a little tired . Will you just let us go ? If you were gonna kill us , you would 've done it already . Kill you ? Who said anything about killing you ? We are the only ones left . I may need you . For repopulation . Why 'd you need the ladder ? I said , " Why did you need the ladder ? " Okay . I got nothing but time . It 's like that old Twilight Zone episode . Remember ? With , Rocky 's manager . The Penguin . Wh-What 's his name ? Meredith . Yeah . And he-he 's all alone after the Apocalypse , and all he wants to do is read . And then he breaks his glasses . I mean , talk about a tragedy . We need the ladder to get across a rift in the tunnels . That 's where everyone went . We need to get across and find them . Find Barbie . You still believe , don 't you ? That the dome is good , that ... that it 's here to protect us . If you still believe that , then you 're even dumber than the bag of hair I took you for . The dome is here to destroy us . It killed them all . Barbie , all of them ... - they 're all dead . - No . You 're wrong . He 's alive . Cut him loose . Go on . You 're gonna end up dead as the rest of ' em . This is my town now . What 's left of it . And that 's the last bit of charity you 're gonna get . If by some miracle you make it out alive , you best stay well clear of me . 'Cause if I see either of you two again , I won 't be so merciful next time . Go on . Hey , Junior . Now we 're even . I 'm okay . Yeah , I don 't remember it looking this perfect . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Can we grab a bite somewhere ? I 'm starving . Yeah , I think I know a place . Is that Barbie ? This place is full . I think we should go somewhere else . Anywhere you go , there 's gonna be people who want to see you . You might as well face it . And I got to use the facilities . Me , too . Tiny bladder plus a long car ride equals ... You 're not finishing that sentence . Barbie ! Hey . Joe . It 's good to see you , bud . - Good to see you . - Look at you . You 're getting taller on me . It 's been a year . Yeah . I know . I was worried you weren 't gonna make it back . I 'm sorry for going ... incommunicado . You know , I went overseas and then ... I-I should 've stayed in touch . I 'm just glad you 're here . How you holding up ? I still think about Angie all the time , especially now with the memorial and all , but ... most people lost somebody , right ? You lost two people . Julia and Melanie . So what about college ? Did you ... Have you made any decisions ? Yeah . Well , I 'm still waiting to hear back - from a couple places . - Good . The Great Barbini . Welcome back , man . Yeah . Yeah . Ready to jam ? Yeah . We 'll catch up at the memorial , yeah ? - Yeah . Sounds good . - Okay . - It was good seeing you . - Yeah , you , too . Easy , dude . Didn 't mean to spook you . What are you doing out here ? After what went down at the diner , you know , I thought I 'd come and find you . Why ? What went down at the diner ? Aw , come on , man . Don 't play . You saw Melanie , too . Melanie 's dead . Is she ? In the tunnels , she says we 're going home and then she disappears . Where 'd she go ? I 'm not in the mood to deal with this right now . You haven 't been here ! Ever since that day , ever since the dome disappeared , things have been different , off . Like-like , remember my asthma ? To be honest , Ben , I remember very little about you . I had asthma ! I used to have to carry my inhaler everywhere . Now asthma 's gone . My-my uncle ... worst drunk you ever saw . Clean and sober , like poof . And beyond all that , everyone 's acting weird . Everyone 's getting along , all kum-bah-yah . Everyone 's talking about moving on and whatnot . You saw her , man . I know you saw her . Okay , and what if I did ? Why is it just the two of us ? I don 't know ! But now I 'm off all my meds , and my head is clear for the first time in , like , forever . Come on , man ! What ? Come on , what ? What do you want from me ? To admit that you see what I see . Okay , what do you see , Ben ? That none of this is real . Hello . My name is Sam , and I 'm an alcoholic . I haven 't had a drink in just about a year now . And I want to say , it 's been a blessing having the support of this group . Before I got here , I wasn 't much for what you 'd call " group think . " But the 12 steps ... got me back on the path . Never would have happened if I hadn 't got sent here a year ago . Strange to say it , but this place has been good for me . This lawyer ... got in touch with me recently . He told me there had been some kind of screw-up in the chain of custody with the evidence related to my case . He told me that if we appeal , it 's possible we could get a new trial . I could be a free man . But ... I have to make amends for what I 've done . That 's the step I got to focus on . Making amends ... to those I 've wronged . And then ... maybe I can move on . Is it bad that I 'm missing the pin ceremony ? I feel like I should be here . And the post-game tomorrow and ... Nors , there 's gonna be so many post-games . And just so you know , if it gets rough at this memorial , if you need to talk about anything , you call me . I 'm here for you . All right , little sis . Are you ready for your pin ? You 're one of us now . You got your pin ! How does it feel ? It feels great . I think it 's just what you needed . Finding your group in college is important . To be part of something that is bigger than yourself . Not to mention , you don 't seem so angry anymore . What is it ? Joe hasn 't been texting me back . It 'll be good for you to see him ... as friends . Are you questioning your decision ? To break things off ? No . But I just wish he wasn 't being so high school about it . And I wish he could see that it 's not so scary , moving on . That 's why it 's important for you to go to the memorial . To pay respects to your mother , of course , but also to show Joe , there 's a way forward , out of grief . You 'll talk to him . What are you doing in my room ? Your mother let me in . You 've blown off our last few therapy sessions . So what ? What do I need therapy for anyway ? I 'm making straight A 's , I 'm working hard . I know you are , which makes me wonder why you 'd want to throw all that hard work away . Acceptance letter to Cal Tech . That 's the best engineering program in the country . Why haven 't you responded yet ? I 'm going to . I-I just ... I haven 't gotten around to it . Tell me the truth . Are you reconsidering the plan ? No . No , I-I ... I just ... I 've been wondering if this is the best time to leave Chester 's Mill . My parents are still dealing ... Your parents don 't need you , Joe . No matter what you do , staying in Chester 's Mill won 't keep her alive . It 's up to you , of course , but I think it 's important that you speak at the memorial about Angie . All the feelings that you 've repressed since her murder . The sorrow , the guilt . It might help give you the closure that you need and allow you to take the next step . Your sister wouldn 't have wanted you to hold yourself back , Joe . She would have wanted you to move on . Please , just think about it ? I 'll see you at the memorial . Long way down . " Long " doesn 't quite cover it . I 'll go first . It 's Big Jim 's , just in case . In case I get challenged to a knife fight ? It bit me ! Keep going . Julia ? Junior ? Junior ? Did you speak with him ? How are you , Sam ? I 'm well . As well as can be expected . Day by day , you know ? I do . That 's good to hear . I haven 't spoken to Joe about it , and I know that disappoints you . But the dome coming down , your trial , all the emotions that Joe has kept such a tight lid on ... it 's understandable why he 's expressing them now . Try to be patient ? What are you thinking ? That I really want a drink . Well , it 's good there 's not a bar around . You think there 's no options in here ? You 'd be amazed by the options . You don 't need a drink , Sam . What you need ... is to forgive yourself . I don 't know if I can do that . Not if Joe can 't forgive me . And what if he doesn 't ? You did a terrible thing , Sam , but that one terrible thing doesn 't have to define you . The lawyer that I sent to you ... he told me that you wouldn 't appeal your case . Why ? Because I deserve to be here . You were an EMT before , yes ? Well , from my experience , no one goes into that line of work who doesn 't have a deep desire to help people , heal people . If you appealed , and you were released , think of all the people that you could affect . You know the memorial 's today . Of course . If you 'd spoken to the lawyer , he might have been able to arrange a short furlough . I 'd never be welcome there . Maybe you could write something . Something I could read later . Then at least you 'd be a part of the memorial . Perhaps it might help you make amends . I need to speak to Joe . And you will . But Joe has to be ready to hear you , and ... I don 't think he is just yet . I 'm ready when you are . Glad we came ? Yeah , I am . It was a good idea . Excuse me . Are you Dale Barbara ? Yes , ma 'am . Christine Price . FEMA sent me here after the dome came down . For what ? I 'm a trauma specialist . I help communities recover after , shall we say , stressful events . I tried to reach out to you after I arrived , but it seemed you 'd already moved on . I guess I didn 't see much of a reason to stick around . Well ... if you ever feel like talking , I 'm at your disposal . I 'm Eva . I 'm here with him . - Eva . Christine . - I was here for the stressful events . Does that mean you 're at my disposal , too ? Anytime . Almost forgot . Would you care to say a few words today about Julia Shumway ? Y-You know , I 'm not really much for ... for public speaking . All right . I wish you wouldn 't do that . Joe . I 've been trying to get in touch with you . Why ? I thought you were all about getting some distance or whatever . That doesn 't mean I don 't still care about you . They asked me to talk about Angie . Are you going to ? I don 't know . I don 't know what to say ... except that she was a good sister . She could be tough , but ... she looked out for me . I just wish I could have looked out for her . Jump , Junior ! I can 't ! Yes , you can ! Stop being a fraidy cat ! Be a man ! Be a man . Dad , I want to get down ! You don 't jump , you don 't come home tonight ! Dad , where are you going ? Come back ! Don 't leave me here ! Nothing good on television these days , anyway . Junior ! Junior ! Over here , you bastards . Junior ? A year ago , the people of this town were delivered from the dome . But some of you , many of you , also suffered a great loss . Of friends . Of family . After a shared tragedy , there 's nothing that provides more consolation than a sense of community . Those lives will never be forgotten , and their memory will be preserved in an eternal flame here at the monument . A memorial is about moving forward , moving on , together . To that effect , I 'd like to read a brief epigraph from someone who couldn 't be here today . " Make a way in the wilderness , " and do not remember the former things " or consider the things of old . " For when you walk through fire , " you shall not be burned , and the flame shall not consume you . " Is there anyone who would care to speak first ? I wasn 't planning on saying anything today , but a lot of you knew my sister , Angie McAlister . Some of you knew her as a waitress at the Sweetbriar . Some of you knew her as a volunteer down at the clinic . Me ... I just always knew her . And she was so full of life , you know ? It 's hard to accept that ... that she 's gone , to say good-bye , to lose someone that you love the most . And it 's hard to move on , but ... I 'm trying . I don 't know what to ... Joe here , he was one of the first people that I met when I came to Chester 's Mill . I was a stranger to him , to all of you . He made me feel like I belonged . First time I felt that in a long time . The people of Chester 's Mill opened their hearts to me . And that , I think , allowed me to open mine . Especially to a woman named Julia Shumway . What can I say about Julia ? She was the bravest woman I ever met . She was endlessly curious . She was , quite possibly , the most stubborn individual to walk this earth in its four billion or so years . She was loyal . She always had your back . Always rooting for the underdog . And she couldn 't help it . She just ... She never lost her faith in the basic goodness of humanity . Like Christine here said , even though Julia and-and many of your own loved ones are gone ... they 'll never be forgotten . I think it 's important to learn that we can both remember and move on at the same time . Ben ! - Somebody help him ! - Ben ! I 'll call 911 . - Is he okay ? - Is there a doctor here ? Someone call an ambulance . Where 's his inhaler ? Why doesn 't he have it ? He 's choking on something . Ben ! Come on , man ! Breathe . Breathe . Breathe . It 's time to move on . Come on , Ben . I 'm sorry . My God . Joe . Norrie . Junior ? Junior ? Wake up . Melanie . But how are you ... ? It 's all right . You 're safe now . When the ground opened up and took you , I thought I 'd never see you again . I was brought here . What is this place ? I can explain everything , but first ... I have to show you something . I don 't understand . What did you want to show me ? There 's nothing here . We 're here . That 's all that matters . You 're afraid . But I need you to trust me . It 'll be okay . No , no . I have to , I have to get back to Julia . I could always feel your pain . Let me take it all away . - Melanie ! - I 'm over here . Don 't be afraid . Melanie ! You 're not alone . It 's time to move on like the others . Where are you ? ! I 'm right here , baby . What 's happening ? ! Melanie ! Soon , this will all be over , once you and your friends become who we need you to be . It 's the only way we 'll survive . Melanie ... please don 't do this . But first we have to fix you . Melanie ! Melanie ! Julia , stop ! Melanie ? My God , you 're alive . What happened to you ? I 'm not sure . It 's all a blur . It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're here now . That 's all that matters . I need you to help me free Barbie . And the rest of them . You can 't . You can 't help any of them . Well , I have to try . No , you don 't understand . If you free him , you 'll end up like all the others . Like Junior . Junior ? He was just with me . We were in the tunnels together . We got separated . I 'll show you . After I was pulled underground , I was unconscious . Trapped in one of these until he cut me free . And then one of those , it ... it wrapped around his legs , his body . I couldn 't save him . Please , Julia , we should go . No . No , I 'm not giving up ... on Barbie ; on our friends ! Julia , your leg . You 're hurt , exhausted . Let me help . Look . These ... things ... connecting all the cocoons and they 're all coming from up there . Julia , I 'm scared ! This cocoon , it 's ... different . It 's larger . I can 't see who 's inside . The egg . Dome . These cocoons . There 's got to be a connection . What if the egg is like ... a key ... to unlock the cocoons ? Your father didn 't bring the egg back from Zenith . But you told me he was on his way to Chester 's Mill . We need the egg ! How can you be so sure ? You saw what happened to me when it was taken from Chester 's Mill . I 'm ... I 'm connected to it somehow . I almost died . I can 't explain it . I just know we have to have the egg . We need to find a way to get a message to my father . What 's wrong ? There 's just one problem . Get out of here ! Go on ! Get ! Yeah , that 's right ! This is mine ! This is all mine ! You better run . You hear me ? Boss ! Is there a problem ? After the memorial last night , I was pretty messed up , so I found some ... comfort ? She needs to go now . Roger that . Change of plans . - It 's a ... work thing . - But ... I 'll call . Hi . Yeah . He 'll call . Can you unlock this ? You insult me . From the look of that vein in your forehead , whatever 's on here 's got to be ... Yeah , it 's important . Yeah , and unlocked . Okay , so this video right here , this was taken yesterday right before Ben died . You lifted the dead kid 's phone ? Not judging . Chester 's Mill cop . Chester 's Mill groundkeeper . Chester 's Mill delivery guy . Different hair , different clothes . Moustache , no moustache . But here 's where it gets weird . They 're all the same freaking face . Barbie , I 'm telling you they 're all the same dude . Whatever 's going down in Chester 's Mill , here 's proof that it ain 't real . What did he mean " not real " ? Plug this in . I want you to play it again . Punch in on their faces . No prob . Chest ... Mill ... No , no , no . What the hell ? What 's happening ? I-I-I don 't know . The file 's , like , corrupted or something . - Okay , so then fix it . - I 'm trying ! I ... This makes no sen ... I ... Okay , I need you to do whatever it takes to retrieve that file . Do you understand me ? Do you understand me ? Yeah . Meet me at the 'Briar in an hour . Ben was such a good friend . I can 't believe he 's dead . Chester 's Mill strikes again . It doesn 't make any sense . What ? Go to college and gain , like , 15 pounds . It helps keep the weight off . You 're so gonna love it there . Who says I 'm even going ? It 's like you 're trapped under a dome and you can 't even see it . Joe , this isn 't what Angie would 've wanted . She was my sister ... Yeah , and she 's dead ! Just like my mom . And it sucks and it 's unfair . But that doesn 't mean you stop living . Leaving Chester 's Mill is the best thing I ever did . It allowed me to heal and to meet new people . I feel like a different person and I want that for you , too . You 're different , all right . The clothes , the hair . A sorority ? Seriously ? It 's nice to be a part of something bigger than yourself . To belong . Is that why you haven 't been back here in over a year ? You 're too busy belonging ? We decided that we would take a break until you graduate , Joe . It was great catching up with you , Norrie . Joe . Damn it . Eva ? Check-out 's at noon , slowpoke . You haven 't even packed . Yeah , I wanted to talk to you about that . Everything okay ? You think it 'd be all right if we stayed another day ? With everything that happened with Ben and the memorial , I think we should stick around . Everyone was pretty shaken up . Yeah , you were pretty shaken up . You were tossing and turning all night . No , I-I 'm fine . Well , if you 're fine care to , join me in the shower ? I can 't . - I 'm sorry , I got to ... - Go ? Yeah . Love you . You got something to say , why don 't you say it to my face , man ? ! Come on . Bring it ! Fine , he stabs you . One of yours stabs him and so on and so on until there 's none of you left . You want vengeance , you better dig two graves . One for him and one for you . Who 's gonna dig yours ? I 've tried everything I know . Ben 's video isn 't on his phone or on the cloud . It 's like it ... Was never there ? You 're not gonna , like , fire me , right ? I just got a condo . Those men on the video , they can 't all be the same guy . That is ... It 's crazy . Ship that off to Billingsley , all right ? I 'm gonna go ahead and call in a few favors while we 're at ... Excuse ... Junior ? Hey , Barbie . You 're dead . Not the last time I checked . Yo ! Incoming . What are you doing here ? I know , I feel bad that I missed the memorial , but my bike broke down . We haven 't seen you since ... Marrakech ? You were building homes - for the poor . - Yeah . How weird was it that we ran into each other in Africa , of all places ? You still seeing that hottie that drank us under the table ? - What was her name ? - Eva . Yeah , she 's actually here with me in Chester 's Mill . Yeah , yeah , I 'd love to see her . You know , minus the crap tequila . Well , I 'm not sure how long we 'll be here in town . No worries . I know it must be rough for you being back here . I think about Julia all the time . Yeah , me , too . Just glad you were able to move on . If anyone deserves happiness , it 's you . I appreciate that . I 'm gonna let you two catch up . I got to go check on something , but it 's good seeing you , Junior . You , too , man . Do you really think this will work ? When Barbie used the dome like this to write me a message , he was taken away by armed men . They were watching us . My father 's men ? Let 's hope they 're still watching . She needs the egg . Let me take the egg back to Chester 's Mill . I-I think that the dome may very well be its power source . You know , 25 years ago , a meteor storm bombarded the Earth . A year after that , the first fragments of one of these so-called eggs was found in a meteor near our drilling site in Alaska . With the government 's blessing , I 've devoted the resources of this company to track down every meteor that fell that night . This was the only egg that was found intact . So you can imagine my reluctance to letting it leave this facility . If the egg isn 't returned , we risk losing everyone inside . I don 't give a damn about anyone in Chester 's Mill . No offense to your daughter . Your son is trapped under the dome as well , no ? That 's not relevant . No , no , no , no , I-I disagree . If I allow you to take this egg back to Chester 's Mill , it 's a one-way ticket . I need to know that you 're doing this for the good of the company , and not for some sentimental reason . We want the same thing . To unlock and harvest the power of the egg and the secrets it holds , regardless of costs . You think my father got my message ? I have to believe he did . And this is where he 'll surface from Zenith . What was it like in the cocoons ? Being asleep . What is it ? If my father returns with the egg , what do I even say to him ? It 's been so long . You don 't have to say anything . He 's your father . Are you okay ? Yeah , I would be , if the world would stop spinning . You need to rest , conserve your strength . - I can take the first watch . - No . No , Julia . Lay down . You 've always taken such good care of me . Always trusted me . Let me do this one small thing for you . I 'll wake you at the first sign of my father . Eagle one ? How should we proceed ? Just hold off until the team has arrived . Also , establish a permanent comm link once you 're inside the dome . Melanie ? I can 't believe it 's really you . Did you bring it ? Is that the egg ? Of course , sweetheart . You know I 'd do anything for you . You 're my daughter . But I 'm not . Dale ? I got your text . Why are we here ? How did we meet ? Are you serious ? Eva , please , this is important . How did we meet ? It was at that dive bar in Marrakech . Your tall friend kept buying me drinks , but all I could look at was you . His name ? What was his name ? I think it was James ? But you and Hunter kept calling him Junior . Babe , what is this about ? Okay , this is gonna sound crazy , all right , but I need you to believe me here . His name was James Rennie , and his name was on this wall yesterday . That 's not possible . Everything is just jumbled up in my head . You and me , Marrakech , Kabul , the bed-and-breakfast in Belgrade . But now , I 've got all these other memories , too . I saw Junior 's body , okay ? He died that day along with his father and Julia - the day that dome came down . - Okay . I 'm so sorry . This is my fault . I thought coming back to Chester 's Mill would be good for you , for us , but I can see now that it 's just upsetting you . No , you-you , but you 're not listening to me . It 's more than that . It 's the-the-these places , these people , something is wrong here . It 's not making sense . What ? Dale ? Hey , you . I beg you ! No , I killed you . What are you , watching me ? ! Dale , let him go ! What are you doing ? - You don 't understand . I ... - No . - Don 't do this ! - He was in the video , okay ? That 's what Ben wanted to show me . Then the video disappeared . Ben told me before he died that he felt like someone was watching him , okay ? That-that all of this was not real . Okay , sweetie , you 're scaring me . Just take my hand . You 've been under so much stress . We can ... we can go back to the motel , or we can get in the car and drive away . We never have to come back here again . I-I can 't , okay ? Not until I figure out what 's going on here . Dale ! Focus on your breathing . Focus on just being . Let your thoughts flow through you until there are none . Eyes . How do you ... ? Because I 'm focused , and you 're not . Again . Breathe . This is stupid . I take it you spoke with Norrie ? I 'm so pissed at her . Life becomes so much easier when you learn to accept the apology you never got . You can 't expect her to be sorry for being happy . She said I was still trapped under a dome because of Angie . Am I ? Let me ask you something . You have always dreamed of being an engineer , a builder , an inventor , so , why do you think you haven 't been able to send in your acceptance letter to Cal Tech , a place to accomplish all your goals ? It just ... doesn 't feel right . Joe , I can 't tell you how to feel . But ... if you really want to know whether you 're still living under a dome , maybe it 's time you forgive the person who put you there ? No . No way . You have kept your feelings regarding Sam buried for so long , they 're like a chain weighing you down . I don 't want them to stop you from reaching your true potential . I have nothing to say to Sam Verdreaux . Then just listen . He 's as much a prisoner of the past as you are . The difference is , you 're the one holding all the keys . Nice ride . Thanks . And you are ... ? Christine . Christine Price . Better not . I heard you were back in town . Who from ? Your friend Hunter . All it takes is a free latte , and you 'd be amazed what people tell you . You the town shrink ? Well , I prefer therapist , but , yes , I help places like Chester 's Mill heal after a natural disaster . Yeah , there was nothing natural about the dome . Well , unnatural disaster just sounds a little too Fox News . It 's a shame we didn 't get to meet last year . By the time I was assigned to here , you were just ... gone . Nothing to keep me here . We missed you at the memorial yesterday . Yeah , I had some trouble with my bike . That 's kind of convenient , don 't you think ? Showing up the day after a tribute to everyone the town lost , including your father ? Town didn 't lose my father . I killed him to protect it . So if the reason you 're here is to see how I 'm doing since the dome came down , ridding myself of my father was the best thing I 've ever done . Now , if you don 't mind ... I 'm just curious . If ridding yourself of your father is the best thing you 've ever done , why haven 't you sold his house ? Lady , why do you even care ? Because like it or not , James Rennie , you belong here . You 're part of this town . You 're part of a community that needs you right now . I can never be part of this town . My father made sure of that . You want to know why I left ? 'Cause everyone around here thinks I 'm just like him . Then , maybe , it 's time you stop running away and show them that you 're not . Wakey , wakey , sleeping beauty . Tell me who the hell that is ? I asked ... Don Barbara . That 's Barbie 's old man ? How 'd he get in Chester 's Mill ? Maybe he would 've told you if you hadn 't have killed him . You think I did this ? Wouldn 't be the first innocent person you 've killed . Well , I 'll give it to you . You got a pair on you , throwing around accusations , considering I 'm the one holding the gun . Where is Melanie , and where 's the egg ? Or did you kill her , too ? The egg ? I got rid of that damn thing . Don was bringing it back to Chester 's Mill . What , are you insane ? After everything that egg has done , you wanted him to bring it back here ? That thing is evil . No , evil is shooting your own son . - Well , he shot me first . - Jim , everyone in this town is trapped in the tunnels under the dome , including your son . Junior 's trapped ? So , if you don 't have Melanie , and you don 't have the egg , then get out of my way ! Listen , if you 're such a great reporter , Shumway , answer me this . Why would I kill this guy , then bring you over to show you the body ? Face it ... you got played . Melanie killed that guy , then left you behind so she could take that egg and do God knows what . Melanie would never betray me . She 's not like you . Well , that 's kind of my point . She 's not like any of us . Nobody gets to come back from the dead . You 're wrong about her . How many people have to suffer because you can 't see what 's right in front of you ? That egg , this dome , that girl ... they cost me my wife . Move ! You 're so high and mighty , aren 't you ? I 'm not the only one in this town with blood on his hands . People are dead because of you . Your faith in this dome has made you blind , deaf and dumb . That is the second time you have called me dumb , and I wouldn 't do it again . Now , if you 're gonna shoot me , do it . Otherwise , I 'm leaving now . My , my , the monarch 's got a temper . Go to hell . Truth hurts , doesn 't it ? Yeah , there 's a space right here . Yeah , room seven , I believe . Yeah ... Honey , just tell housekeeping . This is our room right here , so , yeah , we could just , bring it in over here . Maggie , I just got to get the last bag ... You have your I.D. ? Yup . Dale ? Who is this ? It 's Christine Price . We met at the memorial . I 'm with Eva at the hospital . I think that you should get here right away . How 's Eva ? What happened ? She called me , wanted to meet at the Sweetbriar . She was upset about your fight . We were waiting for our food when she doubled over in pain . I helped her to the bathroom , and that 's when she noticed she was bleeding . - She was bleeding ? What ... ? - Oh , no , no . The doctor 's with her now . He said that Eva and the baby are gonna be just fine . The baby ? What the hell ? Get . Get ! Get ! Go on , get out of here ! Stupid mutt . So why do they call it Hard Lemonade ? Because ... I got nothing . Well , do you like beer ? I hate beer . To hating beer . Was Joe right ? Have I become that awful , stuck-up college bitch that everyone hates ? And we were doing so well without talking about Joe . Is that what this is all about ? Screw him . I like being in a sorority . I love , for the first time in my life , not being so angry all the time because I never fit in . I totally get that . I feel the same thing working for Barbie . I was always this loner out to get back at the system , but now ... I-I don 't know , you know , I feel like ... I have ... direction and purpose , that there 's more to my life than just looking out for myself . I never want to go back to being that guy . The way I see it , you can do what Joe wants you to do , or you can just ... move forward , allow yourself to be happy . Just make sure it 's your choice , what it is that you want . Hey , you . How long have you been here ? About an hour or so . Why didn 't you tell me about the baby ? I wanted to . I just thought it would be better after the memorial , so that you wouldn 't feel trapped . Trapped ? Why would you even think that ? Dale ... I jumped into this relationship with both feet . You seem to have one foot in the past with Julia and the other foot in the future with me , and ... I want to be with you . I want to have this baby . What I feel for you ... is real . And this baby is real . I know what I want . But do you ? I 'll be over here if you need anything . Okay . Sit . Look , Joe , I know this must be damn near impossible for you . I don 't want you to think that I 've asked you here to ... explain what I did , or that somehow I 'm not responsible for my actions . So why am I here ? Because as part of my sentence , I 've been ... working with other prisoners . Trying to help them move on and get their lives back on track . I guess , in a way , it 's also ... forced me to take a long look at myself . My drinking . My shame . The reason I wanted to see you is because I wanted to look you in the eyes and tell you how profoundly sorry I am for what I did . And that I 'm doing everything I can to be a different person . To be a better person . To earn ... your forgiveness . Her name 's Angie . You haven 't said her name once . It 's Angie . And you killed her . - Joe , I-I ... - No . You don 't get to speak . It 's my turn . I didn 't come here for you , or to hear about how you 're getting on with your life ... I came for my sister . The one person who meant everything to me and who will never get to move on . So if you 're done patting yourself on the back for becoming a better person , then I want you to know that the only way I 'll ever forgive you is when you 've suffered the way that you made Angie suffer . Oh , God ! Hey ! Get down ! Everybody , lock it up now ! Lock it up ! Down ! Melanie . What are you doing ? I couldn 't wait for you , Julia . Why couldn 't you wait for me ? What 's happening ? Who 's in that cocoon , Melanie ? You 'll see . You have faith in me , - don 't you , Julia ? - All I have ever wanted is to believe that the dome is here for a reason . But I can 't keep ignoring the truth , not when it 's staring me right in the eyes . If the cocoon protects who 's inside , and Junior freed you ... how did he cut your cocoon open when I have the knife ? What the hell ? My God . Is this what you want , Norrie ? I 'm so , so sorry , Joe . Do you love me ? I 'm sorry , Julia . A process has begun , and I cannot let you interfere . I believed in you . Don 't worry , we 'll fix you , too . And what about me ? 'Cause I don 't know who this " we " is ... but I 'll be damned if I 'll let it kill my son . No , no , you can 't . You 'll destroy everything ! What do you say , Red ? Do it . Barbie ! It 's okay . It 's me , Julia . It 's okay now . You 're safe . It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . It 's over . It 's okay , I got you . It 's over .

 we received your payment . and the bill was for $ 78.31 . great . thank you . I think it 's the intake manifold . - Was I right ? - Not even close . I think I just like saying " intake manifold . I 'll get Triple A. I thought you worked at the water company . Temping . - How 's your parents ? - They 're doing okay . for dinner . we should make a plan . I 'll send you a text . Or we could do that now since we 're both here . - What ? - Nothing . Okay . Nice of Mercer . I always thought you two would make a good ... - Mom . - Couple . Boy from the neighborhood ? That would 've been cute . Remember when he fixed the roof ? Stop . I know . Mm . Any word on the insurance ? 000 . surprise .

I 'm in Germany . - Why are you in Germany ? - Regulatory mess . I got you an interview . - What ? - I got you an interview tomorrow . I did . Really ? No . tomorrow . I love you . it 's just customer experience . what you 're already doing but now a real company . it 's perfect . Tons of people started there . I know . Thank you . Stop saying that . We 're hiring a hundred people this month . good . This doesn 't mean you 're in . You have to kill the interview . Know the Circle inside out . I 'm back next week . you 'll be hired if you kill the interview . I will . Mae . Own it ! for example . It combined everything that was separate and sloppy into one account . identity theft . which is tied to your credit card . I think Grandma 's falling asleep . Okay . it was like you needed a different vehicle and no one should have to own 87 different cars . It doesn 't make sense . It 's the chaos of the Web made elegant and simple . Speed round . Paul or John ? late John . late Mario . Introspection or communication ? - Uh ... - Mae . I 'm thinking about it . - So that 's introspection . - Sushi or Soylent ? - Sushi . Ever owned a Velcro wallet ? - Yes . - Velcro shoes ? - Yes . - Velcro ... pants ? Yes . What was the name of the receptionist who checked you in this morning ? Um ... - Linda . - Joan Baez or Joan Crawford ? - Joan Didion . - " Gif " or " jif " ? I 'm not answering that . There 's too much at stake . Would you like to go out with me ? That 's very inappropriate . Good . Quality or convenience ? Not mutually exclusive . Needs of the society or needs of the individual ? - Should be the same . - You 're most scared of ? Unfulfilled potential . pétanque . - Pétanque ? it 's like bocce but French . - Oh . doga . volleyball . Was that ... ? Was that the ... ? advertising and you . let 's go . Your legs are so long . What ? It 's all on sensors . The elevator reads your ID and says " hello . We do that for visitors mostly . They 're usually impressed . that 's the worst picture of me ever . dear . - Danny ! - What 's up ? You remember Dan ? I 'm handing you off . - You 're all grown-up . - Oh . Mae . And I sent the password to your phone . my God . It has my name on it . - Uh-huh . this is too sad . You take care of my little girl . I will . it 's pretty elemental . Jared will be doing your training . and Jared oversees the unit . you 'll be doing straight-up customer maintenance for the smaller advertisers . You work on your portable here . and it gets routed over to one of you . they 'll continue to be routed over to you for the sake of continuity . and that is the core of it . Simple enough in theory . So far so good ? yeah . - Cool . and they seem satisfied . though that is part of it . You get your smile ... it 's almost always a smile . that is when you send the survey . you know what ? Let 's just do a live one . - Excuse me . - Sorry . Okay . Have a nice day . but I can 't help wondering why it wasn 't 100 . Let 's look . Okay . Boom . Sometimes you just encounter someone who isn 't really sensitive to the metrics . So it 's important to ask them and make sure you get that clarity . yeah . wow . are you ready to do this on your own ? - Yes . - Awesome . Excuse me . I 'm terribly sorry . how 's it going ? just for a day . now here . - Have you slept ? - A few hours on the plane . I 'm good . So you ? First week . What ? You got an 87 average . - That 's like a solid B. - How long till I 'm fired ? it took me a few weeks okay ? all right ? Mm-hm . I 'm Eamon Bailey . Hey . thank you . So glad to see you all here . so can the guppies all stand up ? just stand up . come on . nice to have you . Now " guppies " is just an affectionate term for you baby fishies . Soon you will all grow to become powerful ... - You 're adorable . - I hate you . The fish that guppies grow up into being ... What do they grow up into ? the latest in our long tradition of presenting our newest innovations . the inventor of True You and our founding father . we feature one of our engineers or our visionaries I apologize in advance . Eamon ! Mom . Now you might not have seen me around campus and maybe you were wondering just where the heck I 've been . Surfing ! Argh ! I 've been surfing . And that 's part of what I 'm here to talk about . I would have to wake up and call the local surf shop the local surf shop stopped answering their phone . and I could call up my buddies who were already out stopped answering their phones . And then came ... the Internet . Whoa . Oh ! so I could log on and get some very crude images of the waves at Stinson Beach . It was almost worse than calling the surf shop . Here 's how it used to look . right ? But now let 's refresh that page and show the site with our new Circle video delivery . doesn 't it ? maybe I should be out there right now . But would it surprise you to know that this is not coming from some big camera but actually just one of these ? This camera needs no wires . It transmits this image via satellite . I set up that camera this morning . no one even knows it 's there . I was pretty busy this morning Fort Point . This is my front yard . And here 's my backyard . Here 's traffic on the 101 . did you think this was just a camera ? welcome to real time analytic processing . you 're also getting this . all to serve you better . we are looking at retailing these in just a few months for less than a pair of jeans . And I 'm not talking about fancy jeans . I 'm talking about the ones like I 'm wearing . Wow ! Circlers ... do you like to share ? Sharing is caring ! Sharing is caring . I thought you might say that . - Sharing is caring ? - Sharing is caring . I have a dozen helpers all over the world right now carrying these cameras . Imagine the human rights implications . Activists no longer have to hold up a camera . we 've done just that . Do you see any cameras here ? No . and they 're virtually invisible . so camouflaging is a cinch . This is my favorite . Whoa ! Nice catch . Sign her up . the entire world is watching . with the human rights activists all over the world . There needs to be accountability . Tyrants and terrorists can no longer hide . We will see them . We will hear them . We will hear and see everything . we 'll know . We 're calling it ... SeeChange . SeeChange . too . - Aw . - Aw . We will see it all . Because knowing is good . But knowing everything is better . Whoo ! Yeah ! Good thing you guys like to keep things modest . What 's this party even for ? SeeChange . Summer solstice . Everything . Nothing . let 's be the only ones who know how to dance ! is that Beck ? oh . oh . Come on out of your dreams . And wake up from your rêverie . don 't go to sleep . Streets are running on the brink . what 's he actually like ? You 're in the gang of 40 . but I don 't get a ton of alone time with him . a lot of people work in the White House . How many people really get to know the President ? do you wanna see something ? my God . You need to see this . Follow me . Here we are . Here . This is it . Nice knocker . right ? Right ? I think all of these have gotta be first editions ? okay ? - Annie . - Seriously . so verbal NDA . - I promise not to disclose anything . - Good . This is where Bailey and Stenton make all of their plans . right ? you probably shouldn 't play with ... - Like this ? - You 're such a dork . Well ... right ? We should get back to the party . you should at least . - You 're not coming back ? - I 've got work . 11 o 'clock . - I 've got Australia in a few minutes . okay ? - Annie ... - You 're gonna have so much fun . - You guys are gonna love this . - Okay . Whoops . So I heard there 's a party around here . like ... your kind of thing . maybe I 'll check it out . though . probably not . but they ran out like an hour ago . but shh . Are you serious ? Whoa . too ? - It 's my party trick . - Oh . - All right . Thank you . You 're new here . right ? - How can you tell that ? I just guessed . - That 's really embarrassing . I 'm sorry . What do you think ? - Of this ? - Yeah . I 'm excited . Mm-hm . - I 'm sorry . - Okay . It 's just everyone that works at the Circle you know ... try this Kool-Aid ! Kool-Aid ? - " It 's delicious . You 'll love it . wow ! - I love Kool-Aid . Don 't you love Kool-Aid ? calm down angry people all day ... I 'm just grateful to be here . I got to go put out a fire . uh ... I 'll leave you to it . and stay excited . You 're at the Circle . Did he tell me his name ? I forgot it . guppy . - Oh ! Thanks . Last shuttle will be leaving in five minutes . I 'm telling you Mae-Mae ... there 's something about you . You have a glow . - You do . - I do not have a glow . Like you 're with child . Ignore him . So it 's been great ? I don 't think I ever wanna work anywhere else . Carolina 's mom . I might 've let your salary slip . Mom . - What ? It 's been fun to casually insert it into conversation . My daughter works for the best company on the planet ! And has full dental . Please don 't . I just got lucky . how is Annie ? She 's good . - Working too hard . - What does she do exactly ? She 's in the gang of 40 . Uh-huh . deals with regulatory issues in other countries . That sounds important . why don 't you get your daddy another beer ? Dad . Your hair . It was a phase . It was a cute phase . You good ? I 'm good . You should come visit me at work sometime . At the Circle ? I 'll give that idea a smile . Hey ... They might think I was there to clean the toilets . Come on . They 'd love you . make something out of wood . That really sums me up pretty well . I guess . - You know what I mean . They want you to tell them about your secret hiking spots . So they could put them on True You and ruin it forever ? biting commentary . smiles and frowns used to be for middle school . do you like stickers and unicorns ? you know . And now ... now it 's everyone . I can 't help it if you 're not ... social . isn 't ... this socializing ? break you guys up Mercer . Don 't you have to go and chop some wood or something ? Dad . His business is doing well . Mercer ? The antler chandeliers ? Mae . He 's making one for us . Did I tell you I 'm up to an 87 so far ? They say that 's pretty good for a guppy . Who 's a guppy ? Mae . - Honey ? - Hm ? come on . Dad ? Don 't worry . let your mother . just ... really . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Dad . Mae . We got it . It 's okay . Come on . Thanks . Mae . Bye . I call upon the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee to investigate the Circle . " We 're not violating antitrust laws . I 'm sure the Circle will be glad to cooperate . We have every confidence that Senator Williamson 's allegations will be discredited . You are probably wondering about your new screen . I 'm Gina . - I 'm Matt . - Hi . Dan said this would be a good moment to set up all your socials . - Do you have time ? - Sure . Great . and I don 't think you 've imported your old profile . I 've just been kind of overwhelmed so far . in a good way . I just haven 't had time yet for extracurricular stuff . Wow . That 's so interesting you put it that way . We actually see your profile and the activity on it know who you are . right ? Right . Of course . We consider you a full knowable person of unlimited potential and a crucial member of the community . But you 're such an enigma . I am ? It 's been years since someone so shrouded in mystery started here . - Everyone really likes you . - Your work 's been exemplary . Strong ratings for your first week . Are you satisfied with your performance ? I think I can do better . okay ? - It 's all also about community . - Of course . It 's all connected . like your absence at several weekend or evening events . optional . - I 'm sorry ? - Let 's start with this weekend . Monday . Was there work on the weekend ? no ! - I didn 't ... I 'm sorry . so sweet . There wasn 't mandatory work on the weekend . thank God ! there were thousands of people here participating in a hundred different activities . So many . um ... and I was home helping out with that . I 'm so sorry to hear that . Is that related to his MS ? Uh ... yeah . We didn 't know anything about this incident . Did you reach out to any Circlers during this crisis ? no . I ... No . two of them for children of MS patients . Have you sought out a group ? - I didn 't know . - Okay . Can you ... talk about what you did the rest of the weekend ? really . I just ... I kayaked . You kayaked ? With who ? Nobody . Just on my own . I kayak . We could have kayaked together . no posts . but this behavior sometimes stems from low self-worth . lifting you up . your participation window . I can 't believe you 've been here this long without being on the main social feed . You 're about to have your world rocked . these are all of last week 's messages . That 's why there 's so many . - Eight thousand ? - Mm-hm . Looks like you have a lot of catching up to do here . A feast ! Have fun . forgot one more thing . This is your participation rank . Party rank for short . but it 's not really that . It 's just an algorithm-generated number that takes into account all your activity in the inner circle . That makes sense ? it 's just for fun . bye . I think it 's for Tuesday next week ? Is that in Building 74 or ... ? no . It 's actually off campus . - Okay . It 's been a month . When are you coming home ? We miss you . I can 't . You know . How 's the dorm ? Do you have to clean your own room ? thank God . How 's Dad ? He 's okay . He ... he fell yesterday . but thank God Mercer came by . He 's stronger than I thought . I 'm sorry . I should have been there . Is that one of his ? - Yeah . I think it 's his best work . - It 's awesome . Mom . I love you . bye . Bye . - Bye . I 'm so sorry about last week . I 've been up my own ass . And I didn 't mean to be a shitty friend . It 's okay . Where are we going ? and I think ... I have an idea . All right ? Yeah ? - Hi . - Hi . how are you ? I understand you haven 't done your medical intake yet . - No . - Can you drink this for me ? if you can . multiple sclerosis . I did my post doc on MS. Love to get some real time data . Here you go . Okay . - How does this feel ? - Warm . Is this for free ? Of course . You get to keep it . but it has to touch the skin to work . Waterproof . No need to take it off . shall we ? Is that the ... ? it 's syncing up with the sensor you ingested a second ago . And now ... Let 's have you walk around the room . Briskly . on and on . it 's all collated with the rest of the Circle . You 'd be amazed at the patterns we see and the problems we can avoid when we have all that data . I was thinking it would make sense for ... Mae 's folks to come on the Circle health plan . what ? and I 'd really like to get real time data from your dad . Sit back down . - clear it with them ? - Yep . - Tell them I say it 's a go . - Absolutely . okay ? this is gonna save our lives . - Thank you . And thank Annie too . - They thank you . Aw . okay ? Okay . I gotta go . Big event here on campus . - Exciting . - I know . too . Mom ! - Bye . - Thank you . - Oh . You 're welcome . All right . You okay ? Okay . Come on . Openness is something we advocate here at the Circle . We live it . We demonstrate our commitment to openness every day . not so much . and we get obfuscation . We get doublespeak . No wonder Congress ' approval rating is currently at 11 percent . I 'm sure a lot of you have heard about a certain senator who it was revealed has been involved in some ... very unsavory business . What are we to learn from this ? We need accountability . We need openness . We need to know what the people who represent us are doing with their time on our dime . To serve us better . I 'm happy to report that there 's a woman who is taking all of this very seriously and is taking some pretty dramatic steps to address the problem . So please join me in welcoming Congresswoman for District 14 . Tom . I am as concerned as you are about the need for citizens to know what their elected leaders are doing . So I intend to show exactly how democracy can and should be . my every phone call and e-mail will be accessible to my constituents and to the world . In real time ! thank you . shady lobbyists . democracy . Open and accountable ! That 's right . That 's a fact ! - Where do you work ? - I work in customer experience . too . A lot of us did . Cool . Where do you work now ? facial recognition . I 'm working on Child Track . The program protects children from predators . an alert goes off and the kid can be tracked down within 90 seconds . - Wow . Do they wear a bracelet or ... ? - We place chips in the bone . you 're ... You 're serious ? and murder by 99 percent . I think I 'm going to get a drink . - But ... - Oh . - It was nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you . check your e-mail - ' cause I sent you an invite . - Awesome . Thank you . All right . good to see you . - You too . Mae ! How 's it going ? - Hey . you ? Yeah . - Hey . - Hey . what did you think about the whole presentation ? - The Santos thing ? - Yeah . It 's exciting . It 's a ... what did you really think ? I thought it was a bit much . Just a little bit . So where does all the data go ? Is it stored somewhere ? In the Cloud ? too . Do you wanna see something ? So you 're gonna have to leave your stuff outside before you go in . Just because you 're not supposed to ... you know . So I 'm just going to have to take ... this . And this . I want to thank you already for this . I love following strangers down dark corridors . - This is the best . - Almost there . every second of her from now on . And this will be the next one . no . There 's more . What is this ? it was supposed to be a part of a subway but they abandoned it . - Where does it go ? - It connects to the bay . gets too wet . And that 's where the rest of it will be . - The rest of what ? - The rest of it all . Santos is just the start . available to the Circle in any way . right ? right ? Look . all of it stored . They can use it however they see fit . We 're being studied . monetized . It is voluntary . And isn 't that the whole point ? Having everything in one place ? that 's True You . That 's not why I invented True You . Not even close . Ty Lafitte invented True You . Yeah . I 'm Ty . you 're not . Ty Lafitte has been off the grid for years . my God . I 'm Ty . Why the low profile ? I just wanted to move through this world like a normal person . I didn 't wanna be watched every second . But I do spend a lot of time here . It 's easier . I don 't have to deal with Stenton and Bailey . Not that I 'm privy to their conversations in their little sanctum . Holy shit . I 'm in a cave with Ty Lafitte . you didn 't know who I was ? You never told me your name . it was just weird to ask . she doesn 't have a cynical bone in her body . Reminds me of how I used to be . you can 't tell anyone that you were here . Okay ? That I brought you here . Okay . they need to change . Like what ? Connecting the world ? Insuring my parents ? You should be really proud of what you created . proud ? Proud of what ? the use of personal data for the accumulation of wealth and control ? I 'm not proud . This is not what I created . Do you think Senator Williamson being investigated by the FBI is just a coincidence ? and you have to promise me . You can 't tell anyone that we were down here . Hello ? you have a visitor here to see you . In the lobby ? - Hey . - Hey . I 'm really not okay . send a text ? Because I wanted to see you in person . I wanted to look you in the eyes . Okay . I ... - The stuff you posted about my work . - Your chandeliers ? but ... What 's the problem ? I thought I saw good stuff going up . They started calling me a deer killer . And then there 's a campaign to shut me down . I wasn 't even online . I was working . there were death threats . I 'm sorry . Mae . I never meant for this to happen . But I ... I can fix it . Mae . Mae . Will you listen to me ? I can 't do this . I can 't be a part of this world that you 're creating . What are you talking about ? look at these people ! Does this really seem okay to you ? Mercer ? I never killed any deer . I don 't kill deer . let 's not do this here . Let 's go upstairs . Mae ? and you were brave and excited . And now it 's all filtered through this . Bye . I can 't believe I was so stupid . I 'm so lucky that you guys were around here . Luck ? Hell . SeeChange cameras saved your life . and then we got a call from someone watching the seals . how do you feel ? Ashamed . I ... I barely slept . I 'm just glad you 're safe . We all are . And everyone who watched your adventure online . I hope your folks weren 't too worried . They 're doing okay . I understand your father 's condition has improved . Very much . Mr. Bailey ... I want to say how much I value my position here ... and what you 've done for my family . and you 're family . And we care about everybody you care about . this incident has actually shown a lot of people the necessity for SeeChange . I 'm so glad those cameras were there . I wish you would 've known there was a camera there but ... is there anything you want to tell us ? That I 've been here before ? the things we hide . Of course I know you 've been in here before . do you feel better or worse ? Better . actually . I am a believer in the perfectibility of human beings . the possibilities are endless . There isn 't a problem that we cannot solve . and ... we can finally realize our potential . This is a special Dream Friday . I thought I 'd change it up a bit today and not have a speech but an interview . I had a conversation with a young Circler the other day that I wanted to share with you . who some of you might know to join me today . Mae 's only been with us for a few months but she has made quite an impression . Let 's bring her out . Mae Holland ! how are you ? - Terrified . - Mm . Don 't be nervous . Easy for you to say . we have all seen but please describe what happened for us . I committed a crime . and I wasn 't wearing a life jacket . but you did risk your own life . do you think you behave better or worse - when you are being watched ? - Better . Without a doubt . And what happens when you 're alone and unobserved ? I steal kayaks . Jesus . She 's a natural . Seriously . I do things I don 't wanna do . I lie . you had a way of putting it that I thought was very interesting and succinct . Could you tell us all what you said ? I said that secrets are lies . Secrets are lies . Go on . Secrets are what make crimes possible . We behave worse when we 're not accountable . I was my worst self because I didn 't think anyone was watching . I thought ... that I was alone . Mae ? - Was it beautiful ? - It was . There was almost a full moon . And it felt like ... it felt like I was paddling through liquid silver . sounds incredible . But there 's no record of any of it . - Not outside my own memory . - Hmm . Okay . So now here we get into something personal . who was born with cerebral palsy . And though he 's living a very full life he is confined to a wheelchair . He can 't walk . He can 't run . He can 't go kayaking . what does he do if he wants to experience something like that ? he watches video . He looks at pictures . And much of his experiences of the world come through the experience of others . he feels like he 's climbed Mount Kenya . he feels in some way that he 's sailed in the America 's Cup too . And these experiences were facilitated by generous humans and there are many others out there that are just like Gunner . Now does it feel right to have deprived them Mae ? It doesn 't . It feels very wrong . It was selfish . you 're essentially stealing from them . Knowledge is a basic human right . Access to all possible human experience is a basic human right . for your candor and your consummate humanity . Now ... now the best part . uh ... Mae has some news . From now on ... I 'll be wearing a modified SeeChange camera at all times . I 'm going fully transparent . maybe not in the bathroom . I 'll be starting immediately . That 's right . Mae will be the first Circler to share every single second so let 's give her an even bigger hand ! I 'm proud of you . Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Hello . everyone . and I definitely need my coffee . and we 're up to ... 007 viewers . Wow . Did I tell you guys I 'm not a morning person ? among all of those viewers ... are ... Dad . Mae . Say hello to everyone . Circle . Look . We match . - Yeah . - We sure do . - These are great . - Very stylish . I love you guys . I 'll see you later . sweetheart . Mae . and this is where I still work at the Circle . Because even though I have you guys looking over my shoulder ... I 'm still basically a guppy . - Go ! Do it ! - Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! my God ! sheep . sheep ! that 's our scene . Whoo ! we just need the name of a person who is historically significant . my God ! we don 't know who that is . trust me . Home sweet home . let 's check in with the folks . where are you guys ? Yeah . - Yeah . There you go . - Whoa ! Ah ! Um ... because that definitely shouldn 't have happened it definitely won 't happen again . You can trust me there . This is me brushing my teeth . I 'm worried about you . everyone . each and every one of you . Never a boring day here . which is a treat for me . I finally get to use my art history degree . This was made by an artist who has frequently been in trouble in his own country . both for their persecution of the artist and for their restriction on Internet freedoms . We have sent 180 million frowns from the U.S. alone . You can bet that 's gonna have an effect on the regime . Annie . Annie . Annie ! Annie ! Annie ! Annie Allerton ! Are we alone ? I have three minutes to use the bathroom without the video on . Pervs . How are you ? - Good . - Well ... you should be good . You 're killing it . Do you think ? false modesty won 't work here . You should be psyched . Yeah . - I am . - You 're a meteor . It 's insane . People are coming to me trying to get to you . It 's ... crazy . Annie ? You look wiped . Mae . You know how much I like to be told right after I appear in front of your millions you 're sweet . Let me take you for dinner . You gotta eat sometime . no . I just ... I 'm worried about you . - You 're working too hard . - You 're worried about me ? but it 's good to know you 're worried about me . - I didn 't mean it that way . - Don 't worry in any way . Mae . Your confidence in me will be the wind beneath my wings . How are your parents ? Sorry . They 're over that little ... episode ? actually . I guess it 'll just take some time . Mae . Shit . I 'm fried . And I have to pull another all-nighter . Stenton is on my ass all the time . I shouldn 't have questioned him about that whole Senator Williamson thing . And then ... there 's all the new work on Completion . But I assume Bailey told you about that . Of course . Of course . I 'll be there at the Concept Kingdom meeting tomorrow . What ? - There 's a Concept Kingdom ... - I know what it is . But you 're going ? - Yeah . Bailey said I should be there . - And broadcast it ? - Is that a problem ? - No . that 's all . Those meetings are sensitive . maybe he 's planning on having you attend just the beginning . you 're in over your head . Are you leaving ? Yeah . I could just die . Annie ? Hello . See ya . So here 's how many people voted in the last national election . Here 's how many were eligible to vote . And here is how many Americans are registered in the Circle . And there 's that guy . something we 've discussed with Congresswoman Santos and others . What if ... your Circle profile automatically registered you to vote ? with all the information that the government wants when you register to vote . So why wouldn 't the state consider you already registered when you open a Circle account ? There 's no reason . and they 've agreed to push for legislation that would make your Circle account an automatic path to voter registration . Bravo . I think it 's a great idea . Mae . Why couldn 't we take it one step further ? I ... I don 't have it completely figured out yet ... go on . You started really well there . one step further . " It 's how the company was built . Okay . Working backwards from your goal ... Go on . We all agree 100 percent participation is what we 'd like . A hundred percent participation is the ideal . yes . And we already have 83 percent of voting-age Americans registered to the Circle . Yep . And it seems we 're on our way to users being able to register it and maybe actually vote through their Circle account . go on . Why not require every voting-age citizen to have a Circle account ? Let her finish . Let her finish . I know the initial reaction will be resistance . how can we require anyone to use our services ? But there are all kinds of things that are mandatory for citizens of this country . Yep . We have to pay taxes we don 't wanna pay . And we have to pay for Social Security . - We have to serve on juries . - Right . not on the street . - We do . We do have to be pee indoors . - She 's right . we have thousands of laws . but we don 't require them to vote ? They are already doing this in dozens of countries . users will already be registered . That means you have 241 million voters eligible to vote . You have 241 million voters that have to vote . You have the full will of the nation . - And how exactly do we do that ? - Annie . Annie . Remember to take five minutes and vote . It 's what we would do with our own surveys . You know that . what about stragglers ? - We all pay taxes . 80 percent of us did that online last year . Why not stop duplicating services ? Why not just make it all part of one unified system ? all through your Circle account . We 'd save users hundreds of hours of inconvenience . - We 'd save the government billions . - Hundreds of billions . We could eliminate half of it overnight . Why wouldn 't the government just build a similar service ? Why the hell does it need us ? It would cost too much . They don 't have the expertise . - We already have the infrastructure . - You 're absolutely right . The government needs us more than we need them . Imagine having the full will of the people . Instantly . You 'd have ... true democracy for the first time in human history . This is such bullshit . No voter suppression . You 're voting from home . Think of the implications for totalitarian regimes . No more rigged elections . The UN can demand that they 're held through the Circle . But only if everyone is heard . Every human on Earth . everyone in the world in seconds on any subject . right ? - Right . Yeah ! So it looks like I 've got 20 minutes here . Let 's try Mom and Dad . what 's up ? Hi . where have you been ? - Mae . I 've seen your cameras aren 't working . I can send Tech out ... we disconnected them . Sweetheart ... we can 't keep doing this . it 's more than we ever ... and we don 't wanna ... - We love you . We love you . - We have to have our privacy . And we 're worried you don 't realize what you 've gotten yourself into . I 'm so sorry . I didn 't mean to hurt you . we know that . it 's us . - We just need you to understand that . - I love you . - We love you too . honey . Mae ! everyone . I 'm Mae Holland . Okay . when all of humanity is connected and united . And it will happen . 22 nations have agreed in principle to operate their elections through the Circle with mandatory participation from all of its citizens . they can be better served . who don 't want to be woven into the fabric of society want to tear out that fabric ? I want to introduce Soul Search . here and globally . Do you feel ready ? yeah ! You went well so far . Great . a proven menace to our global community . Soul Search will locate them in under 20 minutes . Wow . Let 's select that fugitive . Okay . England . She was convicted of triple murder in 2004 . She locked her three children in the closet and went on holiday to Spain . They all starved . She was sent to prison in England but escaped with the help of a guard who she apparently seduced . Over a billion people are watching . Let 's see how many are in the UK . Do you all think 14 million Brits and a billion global participants worldwide can find Fiona Highbridge in under 20 minutes ? Yeah ! Yeah ! All right . Let 's bring up the clock . Good . Is everyone ready ? On your mark ... get set ... go ! time to get serious . Mae . That 's her . Be careful . I will . Whoa ! Whoa ! Fiona ! Stop ! - Follow her . - Stop her ! Somebody stop her ! She 's a killer ! Stop her ! Somebody stop her ! - Go ! - Grab her ! Stop her ! Somebody grab her ! - She must be kept safe . - Keep her safe . - It 's Fiona Highbridge ! - No ! No ! No ! All right . Watch it . No . Stop the clock . baby ! I guess that 's it . Let 's do another ! We could . - Um ... - Maybe not a fugitive this time . Let 's try for a regular civilian . everyone . We 're gonna find a regular person . It can be anyone . a lost love . we can never lose a friend . We can take a suggestion from the audience . - Uh ... anyone ? - Find Mercer ! I 'm pretty sure he doesn 't wanna be found . - Anyone else ? - Where 's Mercer ? this is what Soul Search is all about as well as Completion . Other suggestions ? - Let 's try Mercer . - Mercer ! Mercer ! Mercer ! Mae . No . Mercer ! Mercer ! no . I ... this is the right choice . everybody . Hey . don 't you ? okay ? The perfect use of Soul Search . Let 's find your friend . now . Okay . um ... a friendship . This is my friend Mercer . I haven 't seen him in a while . I 'd love to see him again . he 's not a criminal . people . Let 's see if we can break our previous record . Whoo ! yeah . Unbelievable . Can you believe that ? Yes ! Do you think he 's in here ? - Mercer ! - Mercer ! are you in there ? making chandeliers ? we know you 're in there . We see your truck . It 's right here . - I think he 's in there . - Fine . Let 's go around . he 's in there ! come out . He 's gotta be here . okay ? we know you 're in there . You found where he is . You did it . I think we should leave . stay on this . You 've got millions of people enjoying this . There he is . There he is . There he is . We just got Mercer . I cannot believe this . There he is ! He 's in the driveway ! Leave me alone ! Jesus Christ ! You 're kidding me . Can someone please get me audio on the camera ? Mercer . stop driving . It 's just me . stop the truck . You 're surrounded by friends . Can we turn the speaker up ? Mercer . Can you hear me ? it 's me . You 're surrounded by friends . stop . sweetie ? You 've been in bed for three days . okay ? I 've got some new snapdragons that need to be planted . Okay ? Honey . honey . Oh . Oh . The California Department of Motor Vehicles has proposed regulation that self-driving cars should be required to have a licensed driver inside . Is that a good principle ? we would not suggest putting something unsafe on the road . That 's why we have fed ... Mae . Where are you ? - Are we alone ? - Yes . Are we ? Yes . How is it daytime where you are ? you 're in Scotland . I went home . Can you see ? What happened ? besides almost ODing on speed and Soylent ? I found out I 'm allergic to wheat . Um ... I don 't know . I guess I almost died ? don 't . Don 't make me cry . Come on . No . I 'm not going to cry anymore . You getting better there ? I am . and I think I daydream . Hadn 't done that in years . I 'm glad you called . too . I know . really sorry about Mercer . And I 'm a shit friend . I should 've said something sooner . and I 'm sorry . It 's just so horrible . Have they spoken to you about it ? Not yet . I 'm going in tomorrow . Uh-huh . They ask for forgiveness and never for permission . They have to go . They 've broken a hundred laws . They 've made me suffer a thousand regulations . There 's got to be a way to ... What ? Stop people doing bad shit ? Yeah . too ? I 've got an extra bed if you want it . just being with you . - Even like this . - Yeah . Yeah . I know . This is going to sound crazy . But ... I keep having this feeling that ... Mercer would still be here if we hadn 't lost touch . what were you supposed to do ? he drifted away . It happens . all this power . technology didn 't exactly help the situation . What if it could ? and your light was still on . What were you doing in your room ? Were you on the phone ? It helped . I have friends all over the world . They care . Mm . - I spoke to Annie . - How is she ? Good . Better . I realized how much I missed her . I have to go back . Go back where ? Not to the Circle . Mom . a bad system . It ... It can be fixed . Mom . you make them safer . at least wait a bit . I 'm the only one who can do this . I 'm sorry . I love you . it 's me . Mae . How are you holding up ? actually . I 'm coming in to see them today . anything you need . We were worried when we didn 't hear from you for so long . We were very concerned . No contact for four days . Your camera was off . How are you doing ? I 'm okay . Tom and I have been talking about how little we knew about this young man Mercer . He 's someone we should have been able to help . A fund should be established for his family . that 's done . we would like to offer you a new role maybe a lighter schedule . and you can think long-term . if you wanted . Ty Lafitte ... - Yeah . and now he loves his freedom . but at our next Dream Friday ... We 're going to imagine a world in which every disturbed young man could be kept safe . Would you like to join us ? I 'm not sure I 'm ready for that . But ... thanks for the invitation . Take your time . I did what you asked . You won 't believe the shit I found . I 'm so sorry . but they should build a monument to Mercer . this ... this changes everything . right ? and it changes everything . Hello . Hello again . Mae . but we didn 't have the technology . But we will . and optimize Circle services across all platforms . Shopping . Lodging . Attractions . Attractions like Mae Holland . come on out here . Mae . you 're transparent again . Look at that . hello . Mae Holland . Mae ! Mae is a brave person really . Eamon . And I couldn 't agree with you more . too . Tom ? You want to come out ? - Come on . - There you are . I want to thank everyone here and around the world for the support you 've given me since we lost Mercer . I 've realized something about myself and about the Circle . It 's that I don 't want to be disconnected . my loved ones . We lost track of Mercer . But what if we never lost touch with each other ? What if instead of searching ... we always knew ? What I am proposing is radical openness and unbroken connection . It would have to start here . Mm-hm . You know the usual hypocrisy of the digital world . and yet our leaders ... live above it . So I want to invite Eamon and Tom to join me in this experiment that they 've pioneered . I invite them to set an example for the Circle and the world ... to go transparent . guys ? Will you join me ? their every word ? never erased . Ty Lafitte has helped us make every document in the company 's history public . every plan including ... and their private accounts ... and their secondary confidential accounts . not even their assistants or wives knew existed . Until now . It 's all been sent to you already . We are so fucked . I think we 're entitled to that kind of access . Don 't you ? Yeah . you are a very brave woman to do this . There are no more secrets . Privacy was a temporary thing . And now it 's over . We won 't live in the shadows anymore . Hey . Good timing . Thank you . Thank you . the difference between public and private . Aren 't you all ? I 'm tired of standing here in the dark . Don 't worry . Eamon will catch up . Or maybe he won 't . it 's time for a change . We 're gonna remake this place . we will set an example for everyone . The future won 't wait . Hello . 'Tis the gift to be simple . 'Tis the gift to be free . 'Tis the gift to come down . Where we ought to be . And when we find ourselves . In the place just right . To bow and to bend . We shan 't be . Ashamed . turn . Will be our delight . To bow and to bend . We shan 't be . Ashamed . turn . Will be our delight . To bow and to bend . We shan 't be . Ashamed . turn . Will be our delight . To bow and to bend . We shan 't be . Ashamed . turn . Will be our delight . 'Tis the gift to be simple . 'Tis the gift to be free . 'Tis the gift to come down . Where we ought to be . And when we find ourselves . In the place just right

 Westmorland isn 't a 170 He 's just assumed this identity to sell his story . Well , if everyone on the island bought into P.T. ' s myth , do you think the Neolution board did too ? We need to still go after this Al-Khatib guy . The Neo bagman ? He 's so protected , it 's not even funny . If he is bribing governments for citizens ' genetics , then we 've got to ... Leave it , love . Empty seats ? - Suicides . Rachel must have shown the Cabal our proof of P.T. ' s real identity . They 've been had . They 're scrambling to protect themselves . Have you found her ? - No . Is she lying ? You 're forgiven . You 're ready ? Full financial records of Neolution 's dark money bribes . It 's all going public . Helena ! You devil ! No ! No ! The mother who left you knew you had the devil inside . Well , now everyone will know . Sister Irina , help ! No . No ! Sister Irina ! I didn 't see anything ! You can learn nothing in here ! Don 't do it ! Don 't do it ! Don 't do it ! Resynced by F @ R ♪ Of all the comrades that ere I had ... ♪ Some of you know what we have been through more than others . But you all knew S didn 't go anywhere without a fight . And that fight was for all of us . A people , a network , her family . ♪ I 'll gently rise and I 'll softly call ♪ ♪ Good night and joy be with you all ♪ She wrote us a ... A letter . Three of us . Before she was taken . Hey , you okay ? I can do it , it 's all right ... It 's okay , it 's okay ... It 's okay . " Just remember , my loves , death is nothing at all . I 've only slipped into the next room . You can call me by my old familiar name . Put no sorrow in your tone . I promise we will laugh at this difficult parting when we meet again . All my love , S. " You wanna put the rose down ? Go on . Breaks my heart , not being there for them . Yeah , well , Delphine gets back tomorrow from France , so we can all go over together and ... And see them . Today is for S 's people . I can 't even begin to process Siobhan ... I can 't imagine what Sarah is going through . God , she found her own mother ... Felix said she hasn 't even cried yet . She 's just probably trying to be strong for Kira . She always has to be strong , it 's not right . It 's not right . Well , we 'll ... We 'll pick her back up . Right ? The bribes now connect Kuwaiti businessman , Hashem Al-Khatib to the fringe futurist movement , Neolution . A multinational investigation has taken control of all research and suspended the financial activities of the wider Dyad group , Al-Khatib remains at large . Our reporters are on the scene at the Dyad Institute and we 'll be updating the story ... - Mum ? - Hmm-mmm . As the investigation unfolds . Hey . I know you don 't think you need this , but you do . - It 's my turkey chilli . - Thanks . Bloody Rachel is behind this . I know . But , S didn 't blame Rachel . Her letter was clear . I don 't care , she could have done something to stop it . No , Sarah , I want you to know that what S did , the sacrifice ... It was for my family , too . Neolution threatened all of us . So , whatever you need ... However , whenever ... Hmm ... Hmm ... Hello . Want to speak to ... All right . Hey , I think she wants you . Sister Irina . She doesn 't talk . Are you all right ? Oh , no . What 's that ? It 's Helena 's journal . Okay . I 'm inside the cervix , separating the membranes ... You sure you have to do this ? A natural inducing technique . Thirty-five weeks is nearly full-term for twins . We need to get this done in a hurry . There are too many people looking for us . - What about Gracie ? - Be patient , Mark . After the birth , she 'll join us . Until then , I need you on security . - Mark ... - Relax , Helena . Mark ... Mark ... My dear child , so this is where I finally find you . I 've been searching for so long . My name is Tomas , and I 'm going to take care of you . You don 't know how special you are . Gracie came to see her . How did she find her ? Helena wouldn 't have kept in contact with that bible-thumping little traitor . All we know is that they are both gone . Guys , she said there was blood in the room . Oh , my God ... They 're grabbing Helena , just as her babies are coming to term . He wants cord blood , the mutation for himself and then ... And then , to exploit . Last time we saw Gracie , who did she sell us out to ? Virginia Coady . Are they taking her to the island , Cosima ? Uh , we don 't know what 's going on out there any more . We know someone who might . Oh , you mean Rachel ? No . Great . So , then , what do you want to do ? Kira has lost her grandma . - What am I supposed to do ? - Hey . So you need to be here with her . Hey , hey , I got this , Sarah . I can 't sit still , so I gotta come with you . - Don 't move , Rachel . - Felix , I 'm sorry for your loss . Save your bloody breath , you heartless bitch , and turn around . They took Helena . To the island , presumably . I wouldn 't be so certain . Neolution will survive Rachel 's betrayal . But the stress has taken its toll on you , so ... You should be cautious with this . Yes , uh , yes . I need to be sharp . We 've got work to do . After this , find Al-Khatib and continue your clean-up . It 's been going very well so far . Thank you , sir . Those of us who are left are behind you 100 % . Good , good . Well , let 's , uh ... Have some twins . Shall we ? Well , Siobhan knew what she was getting into , Felix . Shut your bleeding mouth and get back to Helena . Why not the island ? It 's not safe there for him any more . His subjects have rebelled and abandoned him . Powerful people have been exposed . And they 're vengeful . So you 're running from them , too ? - Good luck . - Yeah . Can barely walk . When was Helena abducted ? Four days ago , the night of my art opening . Your opening , Felix , that 's the day Enger went AWOL . Detective Enger , that is who I would pick . She 's devoted to the cause . I 'm coming with you . - You 're staying here . - What for ? To make yourself useful . Here 's an old friend to make sure you do . Hey . Hello , Rachel . - Felix . - Hey , hey , how you doing ? Uh , fine , what have you found ? Well , we 're back in the frigid blue arms of the police . We think Enger is the one who took Helena . They want you next . Interpol ... just took over two fresh murder cases from us . What ... What murders ? This Neolution thing . You want to tell me how you 're connected ? Wait ... What did Enger say ? Enough to get me listening . So you have no idea how wrapped up in this she is ? No , I don 't . But I 'm going to get to the bottom of it . Now , sit your ass down . Lieutenant . I don 't know what you know ... You could be a Neolution yourself . But I have to gamble that you 're still police , like me , and like Beth was . We 've done all we can naturally . It 's just of matter of time . No dilation from the membrane sweep ? As soon as it happens , we 're ready . - Hmm . - We 'll harvest foetal stem cells and begin processing a treatment for you immediately . No , I can 't wait . Cut them out . John . A C-section will have unpredictable , epigenetic effects on our prime subjects . We need a natural birth . No need to sound just like Susan . You can hold on a little longer . Oh , can I ? If you won 't C-section , I want hormone induction . - John ... - Do it , Virginia ! Sunshine Super-Hits . The Troggs . No , please , let me out . No , please , let me out . Please . Filthy , dirty copulators . Do you touch yourself , too ? Tell me about the copies . Vony khodyat ' op zemli . English , Helena . They walk the Earth , while the original is at home with God . She 's beautiful . I protect her from science-devils . Well , welcome back . We 're going to start a Pitocin drip , Helena . It 'll induce labour . But the babies aren 't ready yet . They 'll be fine . Twins are usually premature . He makes you do this . Like he made you kill Gracie . You are his puppy dog . Coward . Contractions will start soon . The more you resist , the harder it will be on these babies . Don 't make this more difficult than it already is . Well , I don 't like that look . Two Neo board members found dead . Ian Van Lier . His body washed up on the Humber River this morning . - They 're covering their tracks . - Yeah . And Enger is in there stitching me up to Interpol right now . Luckily , my boss isn 't in on it . He wants me to keep digging on the DL . So , Siobhan 's list has nine board members . Two suicides . Van Lier , and then who 's the other body ? Francine Bernard . Convoy Technologies . Yes , she was in charge of alternative facts . White-washing the eugenic agenda . That 's what the board is for , insulation . Okay , I got two more . Korean politician Seung Pak found hanging in her office , and insurance magnate Jules Martin , reported missing by his wife . Okay , so , that leaves three board members alive , including Al-Khatib , the , the money guy . He may know John 's plans . Where can we find him , Rachel ? You can eliminate the board , John , but we still need protection . We 'll get it . We have the mutation . Life . The fountain of youth . What we don 't need are old liabilities . We 've synthesised his pathogen . Time to move on . Put him down . He 's the sole remaining Castor . Yes , his loyalties lie with a dead girl . I did not want Gracie killed . You ordered that to force this . Virginia , it 's always been you and I with the strength to act . The future is female ! Haven 't you heard ? My assets have been frozen , my visa revoked . But he has the science . I simply seek assurances that my involvement will continue . We understand you opened up a dialogue with Interpol . A delay tactic , on the advice of my counsel . I told them nothing . I will tell them nothing . We need assurances of our own . Hello ! Well , it was absolute murder , but it completely reconfigured the seating arrangements and I got a brand-new colour pallet and ... Suddenly , I feel like I 'm in the wrong boardroom and maybe I 'm early . Get your hands in the air ! Now ! I have broken no laws , Detective . Sit your ass back down in that chair . And I have a permit for this gun . Don 't test me . Don 't do it ! Damn it . Oh , Christ . Oh , this can 't fall on you . - I 'm fine . - Bullshit . Okay , look , this whole Neolution investigation now includes me . And this sure as hell wasn 't line of duty . You did what you had to do . The only thing that matters now is getting Helena back . I don 't know anything . I swear , I don 't know where he is hiding her . Well , your friend Rachel wants to be sure . How many courses of the cure after this one ? This should be the final one . Gracie 's thinking of becoming a dental hygienist . And you ? Thought about being a teacher , you know . There 's that , maybe . But , you gotta go to college for that . You were always the fastest swimmer out of all your brothers . You , um ... Remember those races down by the lake ? Hmm . Rudy used to hate losing so much . Well , you could teach swimming , while you go to school . Why am I ... Why am I so tired ? Sometimes the vaccine causes drowsiness . Why don 't you close your eyes ? Take a nap . When you wake up , you 'll be that much closer to Gracie . I 'm so happy . I know . Goodnight , Mum . Goodbye , Mark . Contraction . First one . Get this off her , she needs to breathe . Inhale through your nose . Exhale through your mouth . Breathe , Helena . Breathe . There you go . Good . That 's good . Look at you . All your games and toys , forgotten . So much purpose in your mind . You are ready . I will make him proud . Dirty copies . They pervert his original . - Yes . - His light . I will cleanse them from this Earth . They look like me ... I am copy . No , child ... You are the original . You are so special . Don 't you see ? They copied your body . But not your soul . I am the original ? You are the light . I am the original . I am the light . I 'm not special . I 'm a copy , like my sisters ... You let him take your babies . Please , not , not mine . They need their mother . Well , that 's just not true , Helena . You forget , I know who you are . Dumped at birth , a killer . You killed your own sisters . You stink , like an animal . What kind of mother could you possibly be ? Call for me when she 's dilated to eight centimetres . What kind of mother ... What kind of mother ... I told you , I don 't know where he 's taken the science . Her name is Helena . Fine , you shot the one person who did know where she is . Mr Frontenac was there to terminate you . I know you don 't like debt . That puts you squarely in ours . Hey , Sarah , we still got nothing . I 'm with Kira and she said Helena is in trouble . I can feel her . Her babies are coming . Well , I see only two options for you . Either , we hand you over to John , or we hand you over to the authorities . Third option , I pull the trigger for the second time today . I don 't know , please , all I know is the person with the biggest target on her back , is her . Rachel . Yes . If he wants you so bad , I say we give you up . Contractions are strong and steady . She 's an hour or two away . Good . Stay with her . Euthanising Mark was a necessity . How are you feeling ? I 'm going for a smoke . Sir , Hashem Al-Khatib ... Frontenac must have messed up . You are still with us ? And I 'd like to keep it that way . By offering you something that you value far , far , more than me . And what could that possibly be ? Guys , do you have any idea how insane this plan is ? Do you realise how many things could go wrong ? Yes , and so does she . Art 's on top of it , all right , we 've got a tracking device on the car . They 're gonna lead us right to Helena . So , then , what 's she supposed to do when she gets to wherever they 're taking her ? Stall . John will want an audience with me before he cuts off my head . Sarah will have to keep him busy . My babies ... you deserve better than me . You will not be an experiment . I set you free ... my babies . Art , have you got eyes on Sarah ? Close . I 'm right behind , tracking them . Is anyone else finding this route familiar ? Why would they go anywhere near Dyad right now ? It 's been swarming with investigators since Siobhan outed Al-Khatib as the Neo bagman to the press . Rachel , why ? I expect he still has the authorities there in his pocket . The front entrance is a zoo . No way Helena is in there . Enger is driving past the front entrance . They 've stopped at the East . They 're taking her to the old wing . That 's where we used to work . I thought they closed down the old wing . We did . The balls ... He 's hiding right next to Dyad as it self-destructs . I practically lived in that building . It 's a converted asylum , it 's basically impenetrable . But I worked security , I can get us into that wing . He 's paranoid , trusting only a few . If Sarah can keep him ranting long enough , then ... We 'll have a chance . You are sitting in my chair . Your turn to snip loose ends , John . Leave us ! Will you tell me about Helena 's birth ? I 'm curious . You gave all that up , remember ? Dr Coady ! Miss , can you hear me ? - What 's happening ? - Hypovolemic shock . - Jesus . - Persistent foetal decelerations . What have you done ? Here , get this off . - Got it ? - No , here we go . Hold it up . Got it , got it , got it , got it . God damn you ! Secrets ? I know yours , Rachel . I know how you cup your hands just so , so you can hide digging at your fingernails , the thing you can 't stop . I know how you constantly write letters to your biological mother - who you 've never met . - Stop it . I know how you touch yourself in the shower , - where you think it 's clean . - Stop it ! Father ... You could have had everything if you trusted me . Father ? You 've never called me that before . You knew it was how I felt . Daughter . Sarah ! - She cut me ! - I got her , I got her . Down ! Get down ! All right . Let go of me , you bitch ! Let go ! I think we 've had enough of this one . John , stop ! - Are you all right ? - Oh , I 'm invigorated . I have an emergency . Helena is in trouble . She needs a compatible transfusion . I need her blood , now ! - Sarah ? - She came in as Rachel . Well , now she can save her sister . Just coming through , live organ . - Live organ . - Paperwork , ID 's . Paperwork was sent ahead . Ask Dr Lim . He 's just dropping off . Paediatric heart transplant . Bit of a rush . Thank you . - Helena ? - Lacerated radial artery , had to suture . - Helena ? - How much blood loss ? - Helena ? - A litre , maybe two . Go check on John , he 's injured . - What did you do to her ? - She did this to herself . If you want to help save your sister , make a fist and don 't fight me . Okay . Good . Now , release . Come on , Helena . Come back to me . Come on , come on , come on . Come on , meathead . Stay with me . - What 's that for ? - I have to section her . You can 't cut her open , she 's lost too much blood . If she 's not conscious to deliver , I have no choice . Helena , come on . Wake up . Meathead , come on ! Wake up ! Hey ... hey . I 'm here . I 'm here , hey . She 's awake , Coady . I 'm right here . Why did you do that ? - Eh ? - Heart rate is steady . That 's good . Thanks to you , we 're still in business . I 'm sorry , sister . Uh ... Anytime would be good . Still closed . How about now ? Are you sure the alarm 's a good idea ? Yeah , I want them here . So I get first drop . Go see what 's happening . Listen , you get your friend and you get clear , all right ? Art , I want to help . Scott ... You did good . Now it 's my turn . That 's good . Contractions re-starting . I need water . Here . Jesus Christ . You are shit mother . What do we do ? Beg . Here , hurry . The key 's there , on the tray . They will come back . Come on , I 'm gonna get you out of here . Come on , up , up . Oh , baby is coming . Resynced by F @ R

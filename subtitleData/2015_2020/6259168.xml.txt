 Peace . Long ago ... Before the Founders established this great city of ours , that word was all but meaningless . An ideal as elusive as a dream . Now , 200 years later , We are , all of us , living proof that peace is indeed attainable . The reason for this is , of course , our faction system : Erudite , Dauntless , Amity , Candor , Abnegation . In dividing people according to personality and aptitude , we 've created a society in which each faction plays a critical role in maintaining the social order . But this harmony we 've achieved is now under attack from a small but extremely dangerous group of individuals We call them " Divergents " . They are , in essence , the worst of what humanity used to be : rebellious , defiant , and uncontrollable . Five days ago , a rogue group of Divergents posing as Dauntless brutally invaded Abnegation : an obvious attempt to cripple the faction system by attacking its most vulnerable members . These Divergents despise our system because they are incapable of conforming to it . These latest rumours , for example , that I was somehow behind the attack on Abnegation : nothing more than Divergent propaganda . I am devoting myself to bringing these fugitives to justice . I 've exercised my right as acting council leader to declare martial law until I 'm confident that any threat to our security has been eliminated . Tell Jeanine we got it . We are all that is left of humanity . The vast wall that encloses this city may protect us from our toxic surroundings , but it is up to us to confront any element that could poison us from within . Because when you are civilization 's last hope , peace is not merely an ideal : it is an obligation . And it is up to all us to take a stand against its one true enemy : Divergents . ( Labored panting ) ( Crows cawing loudly ) Amity ! We need to make sure it 's clear . Tris ! Help us . Please , help us . Please ! Please , help us . You have to help us ! Sorry , you have to leave . - You just don 't belong here . - It 's all her fault . You killed Will . No ... ( Crowd whispers , repeatedly ) She killed ... Mom ! You 've killed us all . Will ! - And ... Three ! - Higher ! Hey . - Higher , higher ! - You want to go higher ? - Alright , everyone , back to class . Let 's go ! - Okay , here we go . See you . I just wanted to do something different . Yeah . Well , that 's definitely different . - You don 't like it ? - No , I like it . I like it a lot . I 'm just surprised , that 's all . - What 's going on , Tris ? - Nothing . I 'm fine . Just ... Still having nightmares ? No . We 're good . You and me . I know nothing else is , but we are . Time for chores . How much longer do we have to stay here , Four ? Until we know it 's safe to leave . - Hey . - Hey . Son . You can 't ignore me forever . I know you 're thinking about your next move , but there are things you don 't know . Marcus , please just leave us alone . Your mother didn 't come back to Abnegation just to save you . She died trying to hide something from Jeanine . Something that was entrusted to Abnegation - a long time ago . - Marcus ! Stop ! Whatever you want from us , you 're not going to get it . I 'm not the enemy here . You found it ... It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior , like you said . You mind telling me what 's inside ? A message from the Founders that will ensure the future our people deserve . Divergents will destroy our society . Unless we destroy them . And now we can . However , only a Divergent can open this box . Find them . Every last one of them . Go with happiness . Go with happiness . - Go with happiness . - Thank you . Go with happiness . Go with happiness . I really don 't know how much longer I can do this whole peace and love thing . It 's the Amity way , alright . Just try to blend in . I 'm trying to blend in . It 's just not working . Coming through , on your right . Hey , here we go . Hey , look : a rainbow . It 's pretty . Virtual pathological friendliness with unquestioned pacifism . I love this place . Thank you . Go with happiness . Oops , excuse me . Hey , Tris , I really like your hair by the way . Did you try to cut it all short and weird like that ? Peter , why don 't you take your food and sit down , huh ? Or what ? Besides , I think we all should all stick together now that we 're all officially fugitives . Wait what do you mean " officially fugitives " ? Ah , you don 't know ? You didn 't tell Caleb ? Yeah , so now Jeanine is saying that the attack on Abnegation was orchestrated by a group of renegade Divergents and their sympathizers . - So they 're blaming this whole thing on us ? - Yeah . Jeanine needed a reason to petition to the council to institute martial law . Now she has one . Staying here at Amity is still our best option for now . We need to keep an ear to the ground , find out where the rest of the Dauntless are ... Then we can make a move . We need to kill Jeanine . I know , we 're not ready yet . Beatrice , you 're not being serious , right ? No , I am being serious ... I 'm not going to stop until she 's dead . Tris , you can 't just go around killing people . No , she 's right . Listen to your sister . Tris , I think you should go to Erudite and kill Jeanine yourself . I 'll stay with Caleb so that you don 't get him killed too . What ? Come on , you know . Like you did your parents . Stop ! What do you think you 're doing ? - My office ! Now ! Enjoy your meal , everyone , enjoy your meal . Calm down . Just calm down , alright ? Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included non violence ? Well , I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again . Well , be that as it may , you can no longer stay here with us . Your presence is just too disruptive . The truth is that our sanctuary was never going to last very long here anyway ... Was it ? With you not standing up to Jeanine . - You don 't understand us at all . - No , I do understand you . I understand that you think you can stay out of this , but you can 't . One day , she 's going to show up and Jeanine is going to take whatever power you think you have away from you . Tris ! Tris ! Look , Johanna , we need a little more time . I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are , then we can leave . And then what ? Attack Erudite ? - I will not be a party to violence . - And no one is asking you to . We just need a few more days . One . One , what ? One more chance . See , to be Amity is to forgive others ... and yourself . You 're hurting , Tris . And my heart goes out to you . I know what it 's like to stand helpless while you lose the ones you love . But killing Jeanine is not going to bring your mother back . I know you 're angry , but you 're letting it consume you . ( Persistent knocking , downstairs ) What is it ? Stay here and keep quiet . Gentlemen , Amity welcomes you . To what do we owe the pleasure ? This isn 't really a social call , Johanna . - We 're looking for Divergents . - I see . Well , of course , anything we can do to help . We need you to volunteer your faction to be tested . - New screening technology from Erudite . - Amity . Now that Jeanine is heading up the council , the approval process just got a little easier . - You 're exceeding your jurisdiction . - Now , Johanna . What happened to that Amity politeness ? The easy way or the hard way ? It 's up to you . Alright , but under protest . Okay , we 're good to go ! - Move it out ! - Round them up ! Give it a go . All Amity report to the dome for new mandatory testing . Please proceed to the dome for mandatory testing . In the building , let 's go ! Get inside ! Line up ! - Let 's go ! Move it ! - This way ! Line it up ! Dome is secure . You know something , lady ? You seem awfully stuck in that doorway . Eric is here . We need to move now , come on . - What 's up there ? - Just my office . ( Horse neighs ) Go , go , go . There 's two guards with guns . We 're going out the window ? We need to split up . Okay , yeah . Okay . Every man for himself . Good . Hey , they 're up here ! Hey , hey ! Eric , they 're up here ! Come on , they 're getting away ! You ready ? - Where ? - Out the window ! I got three on foot making a break toward the dome ! - Divergent . - Got one ! I repeat : three on foot , toward the dome . Over there ! - I demand amnesty ! - Get down , now ! I 'm the leader of Abnegation , it 's my right ! Detain him ! - Woah . - Let 's go ! Okay . Come on , keep moving ! Run ! Run ! Come on ! - Listen ! - What ? A train ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Caleb ! Keep moving . Ammo ! Come on , go ! Move ! - Move ! Go , go , go , go ! - Caleb ! Move ! Oh , you folks sure know how to make an entrance ! - Factionless . - Amity . Oh , you stand like Dauntless . Well , I have no idea what this one is . - Look , we just need to get to the city . That 's all . - Well , too bad , train 's taken . And you damaged our cargo . These are Abnegation fabric bolts and you are factionless , right ? - Caleb ! - I used to be Abnegation . We used to use those same bolts to make clothes for you . Are you saying that we 're stealing from you ? No , no , I 'm no longer Abnegation , so technically you 're not stealing from me . But ... No , you 're not stealing at all . It 's ... I mean ... Maybe it 's a question of semantics , I suppose , whether it 's stealing or charity . - But it 's all really the same . - That 's enough ! Everybody , relax , alright . You 've made your point . - We 'll get off your train , alright . - Guys , would everybody just relax ? Okay , why don 't we , uh ... Take a seat ! Caleb ! - I 'm sorry , I was just trying to help ! - Don 't . Oh , yeah , this is going to be fun . Isn 't it ? Everybody just calm down , alright ? Caleb ... Get off ! Get ... off ! - You alright ? - Yeah . Okay . Tobias Eaton . You say that again . Tobias Eaton . What ? You know him ? I am him . We have been looking for you . What ? What are they talking about ? Four ! Follow me . Tris ! I 'm sorry , I wanted to help . I ... Four ! Four ! Why are they looking for you ? How do they know your your name ? This is factionless ? This is insane . Tobias ! Mother . I thought she was dead . Me , too . Will someone please tell me what 's going on here ? Tobias ' father was very abusive . I knew the only way I could ever truly escape him would be to ... disappear completely . Abnegation helped me fake my death . Anything to protect Marcus ' image . But you just left him there alone with Marcus . I was very young . I reached out to him about a year ago . I felt it was finally time to reconnect . - I 'm still your mother . - No , my mother is dead . I went to her funeral when I was six . And she wasn 't trying to reconnect with me . She was trying to use me . Like you are now . Why ? She wants an army . - An army ? - I want an alliance . - No , what you want is revenge ! This isn 't about me . It 's about putting an end to a system that says one group is more deserving than another . This city may be surrounded by a wall , but it doesn 't have to be a prison . I think that 's a bit extreme . I mean , the faction system isn 't meant to be perfect , but it 's hardly a prison . Let me guess : Erudite ? I was Erudite . - You willing to kill Jeanine ? - Absolutely . When I was married to Marcus , I knew her well . And believe me , there 's nothing she is incapable of . - But I think you already know that . - Tris , we can 't trust her . - Maybe she knows ... - We 're on the same side , Tris . I 'm factionless because I don 't fit in any one faction . And you 're Divergent because you belong to too many ... But we are both a threat to Jeanine . My people are ready for war , if that 's what it takes . And then what ? - We depose those in power . - And once you 've done that ? Once you 've killed Jeanine , who 's in power then ? You see , that 's the part that she always conveniently leaves out . Don 't you tell me this isn 't about you : this is only about you . I know where the remaining Dauntless are hiding . - Where ? - They took shelter in Candor . As far as I know they 're still there . Think about it . If we were to combine forces , Dauntless and factionless . We 'd be unstoppable . That 's not going to happen . Thank you for your hospitality , but we will be leaving in the morning . Four , maybe this is ... Tobias , please reconsider . Don 't you call me that . My name is Four . You want to tuck him in , or should I ? Well ... this ... this meal looks lovely . Thank you . I 'm sorry . I should have told you about her . No more secrets . Okay ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to wake you . I always loved watching him sleep . I take it you 're setting out for Candor in the morning ? Yeah . Listen , I only want what 's best for him . You hardly even know him . You 'd like to think that wouldn 't you ? But deep down , I think you 're scared I know him all to well . - I 'm not scared . - Of course you are . You 're scared he 'll finally see you for what you really are : deadly . You don 't believe me ? Ask him . You okay ? Yeah . - You sure ? - Yeah . - I 'm not going with you guys . - What ? To Candor . I 'm not going with you guys . - What are you talking about ? - What 's your plan ? You guys are going to find the rest of the Dauntless , then what ? You attack Erudite ? Assassinate Jeanine , start a civil war ? I 'm sorry , I 'm just not cut out for that . I 'm not like you guys . I need to go back to Abnegation , maybe ... sort out what our parents left behind ... At least I 'll be useful there . Caleb , there 's nothing left at Abnegation . Yeah . - You okay ? - We just need to get to Candor . Tris ! I know you think Caleb is your responsibility , but he made his own choice . You can 't protect everyone . - I can 't protect anyone . - Nobody can . Him leaving isn 't your fault . None of this is your fault . Johanna was right . You have to forgive yourself . Thank you . ( Loudspeaker : All factions have been instructed to maintain a strict curfew until further notice . ) - We 've got to move . ( Repeat . All factions have been instructed to maintain a strict curfew until further notice . ) - We found them ! - Yeah . Four ! Damn , is it good to see you guys . - How are you , Uriah ? - I 'm better now . I 'm not exactly good for laying low . - Tris ! - Christina ! - It 's so good to see you . - You too . Have you heard anything about Will ? - No . - Nothing ? No . Something must have happened to him . He would 've found me by now , you know ? - Hey ! - Hey . How are you holding up ? - How many Dauntless do we have ? - 175 total . - 175 ? That 's it ? - The rest followed Max . - Not near the numbers we need . - No ... Hold it ! Drop your guns ! - Woah ! Hey , they 're with us . - We know who you are . Last warning . Drop your guns . Alright . Easy . - I 'm Jack Kang , I 'm leadership here . - Yeah , we know who you are . We are not a threat to Candor . That might be your truth , it 's not necessarily mine . All I know for certain is : you are both wanted for criminal insurgency and conspiring in the attack on Abnegation . Those are lies . If you were Candor , I would take you at your word . Unfortunately given the circumstances , I 'm obliged to hand you over to the council . You can make your case there . You might as well just kill us now . If Jeanine finds us , we 're not going to live to stand trial . I doubt that very much . She would never supercede the council . You sure about that ? Who 's going to stop her ? You ? Factional law must be upheld . No , wait , wait , wait . Can I ask you one question ? Can I ask you one question ? Jeanine believes that Erudite are most fit to govern because they are the smartest . Do you believe that Candor is most fit to judge because you are so honest ? I admit , I do hold that belief . Then , would you say that a trial held here at Candor would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite ? The answer is yes . In my opinion , a Candor trial would have the greatest chance of achieving true justice . So you are asking me to petition a council to grant Candor sole judiciary power ? No . As part of Candor 's initiation , you administer a truth serum ... Correct ? We don 't typically discuss such matters out of faction . - That 's a pretty evasive answer . - Evasion is not dishonesty . But it 's not exactly honesty , either . - Yes , we possess such a serum . - Then use it on us . Four ! If we are guilty , we 'll surrender to the council , alright ? If not , you 've just saved two lives . - And made some loyal allies . - Alright . But you should know that the serum can be quite brutal . It was designed for Candor applicants , who are already predisposed to honesty . Not everyone finds it so easy to share their secrets . - I don 't want to do this . - We have to . Neither of us have secrets worth dying for . May the truth set you free . Tobias Eaton . You are accused of conspiring with your fellow Dauntless in the attack on Abnegation . Is this true ? Conspiring , no . But I did attack . I was in simulation controlled by Jeanine and the rest of the Dauntless that she recruited . Tris found me . She managed to break me free from the simulation and together , we ... together , fought our way out . So you are saying that Jeanine orchestrated this attack ? Yes . One last thing : if you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless , why didn 't you just leave ? Why did you stay ? I wanted to leave . But I fell in love with Tris Prior . And I could not leave her . Thank you for your Candor . Thank you for your Candor . Tobias Eaton , this trial has concluded and you are absolved of guilt in the attack on Abnegation . Miss Prior , if you would . May the truth set you free . Tris Prior . Mr. Eaton said you managed to free him from the sim . Yes . So you were never under the simulation yourself . No . How is that possible ? Because I 'm Divergent . ( Crowd gasps and whispers ) I see . So you never harmed any of your fellow Dauntless or the Abnegation ? I did . Who ? My mom . Um ... I watched her die first and then my dad . They were killed trying to save me . And I ... Miss Prior , the more you resist , the more painful the serum will be . My friend ... I killed my friend . He was trying to shoot me . And I ... I shot him first . What was his name ? I can 't ... What was his name ? Will ! I killed Will . This is what happens ... to people that get close to me . They get hurt or they die . I can 't forgive myself . Thank you for your Candor . Thank you for your Candor . Tris ! Tris . I 'm sorry , alright ? - I told you that I didn 't want to do that . - I ... - Christina . - Go . Go . Abnegation sim complete . Dauntless sim initiating . Ma 'am , the Divergent 's vitals are dropping . If we don 't pull her out of the sim soon , we 'll loose her . You 'll stop when I say so . She 's going to do it . She 's going to pass the sim . Dauntless sim failed . Divergent test subject six is no longer viable . Alright , shut it down . Wasting our time ... I 've been assuming that all Divergents are the same . But some are much stronger than others . Assign all non-essential personnel to the Divergent detail . We need to look harder . We need to find that very special one . Where 's your scary boyfriend ? Probably off doing scary boyfriend things . Mind if I join you ? I love heights . From up here , it all just seems so much smaller , you know ? I know it sounds crazy , but ... Sometimes I think I see lights ... out beyond the wall . I know they say it 's all just ... wasteland out there , but ... We can 't be the only ones left . Can we ? ( Gunfire flares up ) Let 's go ! - Closest weapons ? - Rifle ! Floor 's clear , moving down ! - Mommy ? Mommy ! - Shh ! - Shh ! - They hurt my mommy ? Look , I got one too . See ? It 's okay . It 's just the thing that made everybody go to sleep . Okay , I need you to do me a favor : I need you to go to the top of those stairs over there and don 't come down until your mommy comes to get you . - Don 't come down . - Don 't come down . Can you do that ? Be brave , okay ? Okay . Go . Hey ! Why are we the only ones awake ? Because we 're Divergents . Come on , I need your help . We have to open this . Uriah , I need your help . Hey ! Look who decided to show up . It 's really good to see you again . Alright , folks , nothing to be nervous about . Just a little routine inspection , then we can all go back to our business . Hello . Divergent , 10 % . Huh . Shit . You 're almost normal . That 's boring . That is not part of the mission . So what ? As far as I 'm concerned , the rest of them are still outlaws . Let 's just wrap this up quickly . The others are going to be awake soon . - Hi , Sweetie . - I should not ... - Divergent , 40 % . - I 'm afraid it 's not you either . The lady said that I should not ... The lady said that I shouldn 't have come downstairs . I guess you should have listened . Enough ! We still have to test her . Eric ! Jeanine told us that we have to test everyone . - Divergent 100 % . - I 'll be damned . - What ? - She 's what we 've been looking for . Bullshit . Divergent 100 % . Get her in the vehicle . I 'll alert Jeanine . If you think you got lucky , you are wrong . You 're going to wish I killed you . Drop your weapons ! Right there ! Down where I can see them ! Hey . Thank you . It 's lucky you got that gun , Four . We both know you 're never much without one . You think she 's safe now ? You 're wrong . Jeanine 's never going to stop searching for you . Why ? What does she want with her ? Tell me ! Look , all I know is she 's exactly what Jeanine needs . She 's the perfect subject . Was that supposed to scare me ? You 're responsible for the death of hundreds of people . You know the punishment for that . Listen ... I found a way to live with the blood on my hands . But can you ? Why won 't they come out ? All I know is it put me in a sleeping sim and then I woke up to all hell breaking loose . Hack , don 't play with it ! You all know what this means . Thank you . - For helping us . - I wish I could do more . I had no idea Jeanine was capable of something like this . It 's time we fight back . - We don 't have the numbers . - We will . Once we get to factionless . You heard Eric . Jeanine is never going to stop coming after you . It 's our only option . Tris Prior . Of course . It had to be her . - Is she still off the grid ? - Yeah . Yeah , but I think I found a solution . - It 's Peter , right ? - Yeah . And , Jeanine , can I just say it is truly an honor to finally meet you in person . Congratulations , Mother . You got your war . - I know you wish there was another way . - But there isn 't . I 'm the lesser of two evils , is that it ? - You 'd better be . - Tell me ... Why did you surrender to Erudite ? What do you want ? I would like a position in your regime . Ideally , I would like a position with some advancement opportunities . I may be Dauntless , but I 'm not just some meathead . No offense , Max . Prove your worth to us . Then we can discuss your ambitions . Great . When do I start ? Let 's talk about your friend , Tris Prior . - How do I flush her out ? - It 's simple . The girl is a walking bleeding heart . She was born Abnegation . That 's her weak spot . You just have to know how to press it . - Help ! Come quick ! - It 's coming from up there ! Christina ! Please , help ! Somebody , do something ! - Look ! On the ledge ! - What are they doing ? The traitor , Tris Prior , must be surrendered to Erudite . Or every day more death will follow . - Go ! - Hand over Tris Prior . Or every day more death will follow . Hand over Tris Prior . - Or every day more death will follow . - Get them down ! Hunter , no ! Hand over Tris Prior . - Or every day more death will follow . - Christina ! No ! Christina ... Christina ! Tris , help me ! Tris ! We removed this from the body of the suicide . Marlene . Her name was Marlene . I 'm sorry . Marlene . It 's a very sophisticated sim serum injector . It also has a radio transmitter in its head . - How do we get them out ? - I don 't know . This tech was built to defend itself . This tendril ... wraps around the nearest major artery . Try to remove them and ... they kill the host . ( Indistinct , worried chatter ) - That 's insane ! - So what do we do ? Tori has to find a way to neutralize the disks before we do anything else . Or we could do the logical thing . And we hand her over . Nobody knows about this alliance : we have to protect that advantage . If we hand Tris over now , it might buy us some time ! ( The factionless raise their voices in agreement ) - I think it 's a good idea . - Get rid of her ! Damn right . Except you 'll have to go through me first . - Me too . - And all of us ! ( The Dauntless rally behind Four ) Hey , hey ! I ain 't the one with the time bomb in my arm ! - Yeah , kick them out ! - You 've got to go ! I know what you 're thinking ... But I 'm not going to let you do it . I can 't let anyone else die because of me . No one else is going to die because of you . Tori 's going to find a way to disable the disks . - And if she doesn 't ? - Then ... Then if she doesn 't , we figure it out . Together . You know , I 'm just one person . - I 'm not worth it . - You are worth it . You are more than worth it to me . I love you . ( Jeanine via loudspeaker : ... maintaining the social order . But this harmony we 've achieved is now under attack . ) ( This city may be safely enclosed behind a vast wall , but make no mistake : that wall alone does not ensure our security . ) ( It 's up to us , every one of us , to remain vigilant in identifying and isolating any potential threat to our stability . ) ( There are individuals hiding among us who must be contained . ) ( So permit me to address the objections from my fellow faction leaders . ) ( I am aware that there have been some concerns about the unavoidable raid on Candor . ) ( So let me be clear : ) ( The harbouring of Divergents by any faction ) ( can not be tolerated . ) ( Very soon , I will be presenting what I believe to be ) ( no less than a mandate from the Founders themselves . ) ( And this will , I have no doubt , validate the measures I am taking to keep the peace ) ( and provide the instructions that will allow us to eradicate the Divergent crisis . ) ( Once and for all . ) Where are you going ? Tris left . She 's gone . What ? When ? - Last night . - Wait . Tobias ! People look to you for leadership . You can 't just abandon them . Tobias ! Wow ! I have to admit , I 'm impressed . I mean , I knew that you were dumb , but ... I didn 't think you were dumb enough to actually come down here ... and turn yourself in . The killings have to stop . Well , that just shows that you can take the girl out of Abnegation but you can 't take the Abnegation out of the girl . Let 's go . Once a stiff , always a stiff . Right ? - What is this ? - What is this ? This is the only reason why you 're alive , Tris . Man , I love knowing stuff that you don 't . I need you to open up that box , Tris . The only way to open that box is to pass the sims of all five factions . But the only people that have tried to do it so far have died . Oops . I don 't think I was supposed to tell you that . Oh well ... No pressure . Remarkable ! The chances of it being you , of all people . Nearly defies the laws of probability . As remarkable as the amount of people you 've managed to murder . Dark times call for extreme measures . You may find it hard to believe . But I am serving the greater good . Step up on the disk , please . ( Peter cocks his gun ) Step up on the disk , please . Ma 'am ? Hmm ? Oh . Stop the suicides or I swear I will shoot him . That 's okay . You can kill him if you want , we have plenty of guards . What ? I 'm guessing you need me alive for this to work . Right ? Right ? Beatrice . Caleb . Caleb . Don 't engage the subject . Conditions are already less then optimal . Oh , my God . If I do this , the suicides stop . No . The suicides will continue . Until you succeed and pass all five sims . That should be incentive enough . Good luck . Let 's begin . Initializing Dauntless sim . Mom . Tris , help me ! Mom ! - Tris ! - Mom ! Her heart rate is rising . Keep her in play . Mom ! - Tris ! - I 'm coming . Mom ! I 'm coming . Tris ! Help me ! Hold on ! Tris . Dauntless sim complete . Mom . I miss you so much . I know you do . But I 'm still with you . You need to be strong now . Tell me you 're going to be strong . - I 'm trying . - You can do this . I know you can . You 're brave . Braver than anyone . I 'm not brave , mom . I pretend that I am . And I want people to think that I am , but I 'm not . I 'm really , really scared . That maybe we are actually what 's wrong in this world . Divergents . I never wanted any of this . You , and dad , and Caleb , and then Four . I can 't help but think that if I was normal , we would all still be together . Mom , I don 't want to be Divergent anymore . I just want to feel safe again . Candor sim complete . Four . You 're here ? - Yeah . Yeah . - You 're here . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Secure the hallway . Okay , let 's get you out of here . - You good ? - Yeah . Stop . Let him go . Wait , you 're not going to shoot me ? Once a stiff , always a stiff . Go ! Four , how did you get past security ? You know me : scary boyfriend skills . What is it ? You weren 't there . You didn 't even hear that . Tris . We need to leave now . Alright ? I 'm sorry , Four . - What ? - I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you that I was going to go . I wanted to say goodbye , and I just didn 't know how . I didn 't know how . What are you talking about ? So even though I didn 't get to say it in real life , at least I get to say it now . - Even if it is just in a sim . - Tris , we 're not in a sim . Don 't you think I would know if I was in a sim ? Four ... you 're not in a sim . - You are the sim . - Wait , wait . Erudite sim complete . There 's only Amity now . She hasn 't passed Abnegation yet . Yes , she has . When she spared your life . This girl is extraordinary . She 's tested positive for four factions in one day . No one has gotten that far . We 've got a problem . She 's crashing . We have to rest her . Sure you 're not letting familial attachment cloud your judgement ? See for yourself . Very well . Detach the subject . Good work , everyone . We will resume tomorrow . You were never planing on going back to Abnegation , were you ? I had to do what I thought was right . Our parents would be ashamed of you . Well maybe not . I mean , I am willing to sacrifice you . The only family I have left . The only person I love . In order to preserve what 's best for everyone else . What 's more selfless than that ? What does Jeanine think is in that box , Caleb ? It 's a message from the Founders . But the box was to be opened only if the faction system broke down . Which is why it requires someone like you to open it . You are living proof that the Divergent problem has grown beyond all control . Do you even hear what you are saying right now ? No one thinks it 's your fault that you were born this way . Jeanine murdered an entire faction , Caleb . That faction could no longer be trusted . She killed our parents . Our parents brought that on themselves . What are you talking about ? The box . It was in their house . They were the ones hiding it . All those lives could have been spared . Seems we didn 't knew our parents as well as we thought we did . Alright . Family reunion is over , it 's time to go . I got a little surprise for you , Tris . - Four ! - Tris ! - Tris ! - Four ! Four ! - Tris ! - Four ! Four ! Four ! Four ! I gather your brother explained to you how vital the work you 're doing here is to the future of the city . Please , just let Four go . If his well-being is of such concern , then you should focus on the task at hand . Tell me ... Do you appreciate irony ? You tested positive for Erudite , so you must have the intellectual capacity . Irony ? For instance , right now you are filled with hate , but you need to pass an Amity sim . Then there are other ironies at work too . - Such as the fact your cherished mother ... - Don 't . who you so dauntlessly saved in the sim is the reason you 're in this mess to begin with . You are the reason I 'm in this mess . - And then there the most poignant irony of all ... - Stop . That Nathalie Prior not only died trying to protect the data - that I now have in my possession . - Because you stole it from her . You killed her for it ! Data that she so selfishly withheld . But her own daughter , her beloved Divergent , Tris , is going to be the one to deliver it to me . - I said stop ! - Therefore ... your mother 's death , just like your boyfriend 's death ... . will mean absolutely nothing . Don 't pull her out . Not yet . No ! No ! Bring her back ! Bring ... Bring her back ! Now ! Bring her back ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Bring her back ! Test subject seven is no longer viable . I really thought you were the one . We 'll just ... We 'll just have to resume our search . Find solace in your faction , Caleb . We are your family now . Jeanine wanted me to show you this . Hey , Four , maybe do that thing you do ? Hey , Four , come on . That was pretty good , right ? First , I swiped a paralytic from the infirmary . Then I shot her up when she was all freaking out about you . I mean , I told these guys I was pretty smart . Guess they should have listened . - You 're real ! - Yeah , I 'm real . What are you doing here ? You die , I die . Oh ... Okay , guys . Come on . Let 's go , seriously . We can ... do that later . - You okay ? - Yeah . - Thank you , Peter . - Yeah , whatever . Now we 're even , Stiff . Alright , come on . Let 's go . - Before Jeanine realizes you 're still alive . - No , no , no . - What ? - The box ! We have to get the box ! Are you kidding me ? Now is not the time for a souvenir , Tris ! Four , you have to listen to me . It 's not what Jeanine thinks it is , I know it 's not . My mother would have destroyed it . We have to get it . Peter , is there another way into the lab ? I mean , I 'd have into go into the control room to disable all the doors . Okay , good . Then do that . - Okay , right now ? - Yeah . You just chose our side , whether you meant to or not . If you want to survive , make sure we do . Let 's go ! Fuck ! No guns . It 'll draw too much attention . - Hey . - Hold up ! - Access denied . - Come on ! - Access granted . - Alright , let 's go . - Come on . Is that it ? - Yes . Alright , grab it and let 's go . - Security breach . Security breach . Lock down . - What 's going on ? - What 's going on ? What is it ? - There 's been a breach in the sim room , but ... Get me a remote feed . I want to see who the hell is in there . - The cameras are down in the sector , too . - I 'll send the guards there now . Let 's go . Bring up every cell ! Now ! Show her . Tori finally found a way to get them out safely . - How many others ? - Every last one of them . Let 's go ! Tris ! Tris , come on , we 've got to move . Tris , we have to move ! I can 't ! I can 't ! My mom died protecting whatever is inside this . I have to open it for her and I think I know how . - Tris , if we don 't leave now , we 're not going to get out of here . - I have to do this first . I know it doesn 't make any sense but you have to trust me , please . You have my life , apparently . Do it . Don 't move ! Initializing Amity sim . Back again , are we ? You 're an even bigger fool than your mother . Say whatever you want to me , Jeanine . But I 'm not going to fight you . - How very Amity of you . - I mean it . - I 'm not going to fight you . - Of course you 're not . You 're going to fight her . The one you really hate . What are you ? I 'm you , Tris . I 'm the real you . I 'm not going to fight you . - I 'll make you fight me . - You 're not me . I am . I 'm what they see when they look at you . You killed Will ... and your parents . You 're deadly . That 's enough ! No one 's going to love you , Tris . They 're never even going to miss you . This world will be better off without you . One less Divergent ruining everything . And no one will ever , ever forgive you for what you 've done . You 're wrong . Because I will . Amity sim complete . - Wait ! - No ! Stop ! Initializing message . Hello . I come from outside the wall . Where we have all but destroyed each other . We designed your city as an experiment . We believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost . And we created factions to ensure peace . But we believe there will be those among you who will transcend these factions . These will be the Divergent . They are the true purpose of this experiment . They are vital to humanity 's survival . If you 're watching this now , then at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded . The time has come for you to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us . We have allowed you to believe that you 're the last of us , but you 're not . Mankind waits for you , with hope , beyond the wall . You okay ? Yeah . Yes . You were wrong about us . We were never the problem . We 're the solution . - Bury the box . - What ? No one sees it . Ever . Kill them both . No ! Don 't move . Down ! Put your weapons down now ! Stay ! - Put it down ! - Do not move ! Hello , Jeanine . Evelyn ? Impressive . I think we 're going to like it here . Do you honestly think the other factions will stand for this ? Because you 're so popular ? Get her out of here . When that message gets out , it will be the end . What message ? You 'll see . I 'm going to put it on every monitor in the city . ( Founder via loudspeaker : We have separated you from the rest of us . ) ( And we created factions to ensure peace . ) ( The time has come for you to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us . ) ( We have allowed you to believe that you 're the last of us , ) ( but you 're not . ) ( If you 're watching this now , then at least one of you is proof ) ( that our experiment has succeeded . ) ( Mankind waits for you , with hope , ) ( beyond the wall . ) These will be the Divergent . They are the true purpose of this experiment . They are vital to humanity 's survival . You did it . Yeah . Everyone 's staring at me . You changed everything . What now ? Only one way to find out . You ready ? It 's been over 200 years . Who knows what 's out there ? You 'll never find out .

 HOLDEN : Previously on The Expanse ... POCK MARK : Sayonara , Ceres . That 's my going-away present to you . Onto bigger and better things . DAWES : You 're in love with Julie Mao . ( GASPING ) ( SCREAMING AND SOBBING ) NAOMI : There 's nothing you can do for her . Drop ' em . Not happening . Jesus , Miller . What the hell you got yourself into ? This datacube was recovered from the wreckage of the Donnager , in the armor of a Martian Marine . It 's a detailed analysis of the ships that destroyed the Donnager . They didn 't come from the Belt . They were built by Earth . DRESDEN : I 'm truly sorry to be the one to have to tell you this , but your daughter is dead . We can only learn by letting it learn . Proceed as planned . ( CROWD SCREAMING ) HOLDEN : What the hell was that ? If I 'm not back in three hours , leave . ALEX : As far as I can tell , all the transit pod lines are shut down . NAOMI : Why would they do that ? First things first . The Roci . There 's got to be other ways to get to the docks , so we need to find one . MILLER : Damn it ! If he killed Julie , he killed my ship too . I need you alive ! ( GRUNTS ) You stand down . I 've got rank here . Not today , you don 't . ( GROANS ) Why are you herding everybody into those shelters ? 'Cause that 's what they asked me to do today ! If these assholes want people in those shelters , we should let them out . ( PEOPLE COUGHING ) HOLDEN : Jesus . Get out . Get out ! ( ALARM BEEPING ) We just got hit with a mega dose of hard radiation . How bad ? We 're dead . EMERGENCY SYSTEM VOICE : Eros Station has experienced a radiation hazard breach . For your own safety , please proceed immediately to the nearest hard shelter in an orderly fashion . ( PEOPLE GROANING IN DISTANCE ) SEMATIMBA : They 're Miller 's friends . That 's a stretch . Where the hell is he ? NAOMI : No clue . He 's got his own agenda . This emergency is bullshit . There 's no radiation in the tunnels . SEMATIMBA : That 's not the only thing that stinks . These CPM guys are a bunch of gangsters from Ceres . I don 't know what game they 're playing , but they 're working for someone else , hard-core mercenaries . We 're getting off this rock . All ships are locked down . Yeah , well , the Roci ain 't " all ships . " SEMATIMBA : Yeah , well , even so , they 've shut down all access to the docks . Look , I can find you guys a place to hole up , ride this thing out . Something terrible is happening here , and we 're not sticking around to find out what . Help us get into the old mech shafts . They 'll lead us to the docks . The mech shafts ? ( SCOFFS ) Half those things are collapsed . I 've been a cop here for years , I can 't even find my way through that maze . Which is why the OPA uses them as smuggling routes . On every station , Eros included . Get us into them , and I 'll get us through them . Okay . Okay , I got a CPM override . I can unlock your ship . MAN : Take us with you . Please . Please , we won 't be any trouble . ( EMERGENCY SYSTEM VOICE REPEATS INDISTINCTLY ) HOLDEN : All right , grab anything that looks like a painkiller , stims , anti-nausea . We 're going to need it . It 'll give us time . You a medic ? Ice hauler . Great . MILLER : Uh , mephedrone . Perfect . EMERGENCY SYSTEM VOICE : Eros Station has experienced a radiation hazard breach . ( GROANS ) For your own safety , please proceed immediately to the nearest hard shelter in an orderly fashion . ( GROANS ) ( SIGHS ) I 'd say we 're cured then . At least we 'll be sharp while we melt from the inside out . What the hell did we just see back there ? We saw a bunch of people getting cooked by radiation . Yeah , in a radiation shelter . Uh , you , uh ... How long you figure we got ? Couple of hours maybe . You got radiation meds on that ship of yours ? I hope so . Couple of hours . We can make that . ( GRUNTS ) Yeah , couple of hours till we 're bleeding out of places you don 't even wanna know about . Half that time till our ride leaves . You told your crew to take off without you ? Dick . Yeah ? What 's the fastest way to the docks ? It 's my first time on Eros , all right ? First time anywhere . Great . ( DEVICE WHIRRING ) DRESDEN : Hmm . Do you have children ? Not as far as I know . Sooner or later , they disappoint you . Few are as fortunate as Julie Mao . She was blessed . She touched the unknown and it touched her in return . She 'll make her father very proud . She 's gonna save us all . ( MILLER COUGHING ) ( EMERGENCY SYSTEM VOICE ANNOUNCING IN OTHER LANGUAGE ) ( SNIFFS ) Transit pods are down . ( GUNSHOTS IN DISTANCE ) ( SNIFFLES ) You any good with a tool ? ( GUN COCKS ) I 've never shot anyone . Half the system thinks you 're some kind of outlaw hero , but you 're really kind of clueless , aren 't you ? Well , then , thank God I got you here . ( GUNSHOTS CONTINUE ) MAN : Move , move . We 're on a clock . This should be an interesting day for you . WOMAN : All right . Let 's move it . Got us a simple space down right here . ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) HOLDEN : In here . MAN : This way . Let 's go . ( ARCADE CONSOLE CHIMING ) Get over there . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( PANTING ) MILLER : ( WHISPERING ) Please don 't stop here . Please don 't stop here . Please don 't stop here . Let 's go . Over there . ( ENGINE TURNS OFF ) ( COUGHING ) ( EQUIPMENT CLANGING ) How long until your girlfriend takes off ? HOLDEN : She 's not my girlfriend . She ain 't gonna leave you here , is she ? You don 't know Naomi Nagata . What the hell are they building out there ? MILLER : Let 's go ask ' em . Wait ! There 's six guys ! Heavily armed ! All right , the math sucks . Got a ship to catch , right ? Hey . Why is everything so half-cocked with you ? You want to stay here , huh ? Rot in the corner and whimper ? Go ahead . Maybe there 's another way out of here ! A conduit , something behind the walls . Look around . ( SIGHS ) I grew up in a goddamn pachinko parlor , okay ? And I sure as shit don 't want to die in one . Your optimism is inspiring . Optimism is for assholes and Earthers . ( GRUNTING ) And Belters , we know what 's up . We know the game 's rigged . It 's been rigged from the start . Always has been . ( GRUNTING ) ( SIGHS ) You know , me and Semi , when our hands were small enough , we used to reach into these machines , grab the chips that got caught in the chute . It was enough to feed a couple of street rats for a week . But you know , one day , your hand gets too big and it gets stuck . Had a hell of a beating out of it . And naturally , you evolved into cops ? That was Semi 's idea . He said , " You wanna be an ass or you wanna be a boot ? " And which one are you now ? ( SNIFFLES ) JULIE : Yeah . Which one are you now ? I 'm sorry , kid . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) HOLDEN : Miller ! Miller ! Get down ! Get down ! Someone 's coming ! Get down ! ( DOOR OPENS ) CPM GOON : Come on , come on where are ya ? Ha ! There you are . PROTOGEN MERC : All right . That 's it . Let 's move out . CPM COP : Wait . Where 's Anudo ? CPM GOON 1 : Oh , I love this game . ( COIN CLINKS INTO CONSOLE ) CPM COP : Anudo ? ( ARCADE CHIMES ) Anudo ? ( MUFFLED COUGH ) PROTOGEN MERC : We 're not waiting for any of you CPM rent-a-cops . He 's on his own . Now move out . CPM GOON : Come on . Come on . ( ARCADE GAME CHIMING ) Ah , come on . Ah , yes , yes ! ( CASINO CHIPS CLATTERING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Come on , come on ! Yeah ! Attagirl ! ( LAUGHS ) ( CHOKING ) ( STRUGGLING ) ( BONE CRACKS ) CPM COP : Anudo ? Anudo ! ( OVER RADIO ) Anudo , you asshole . Just meet us at the docks . ( COUGHS ) ( SIGHING ) ( GROANS ) ( COUGHS ) SOUTHER : Of course Fred Johnson is lying . It 's his back-handed way of getting retribution against Earth . CHRISJEN : What if he 's telling the truth ? ( SCOFFS ) You believe him ? I believe we need a full investigation of the fusion drives in question . And you 'll see it all in the intel briefing later tonight . Those drives were built at the Bush shipyards , but for private contracts and not for us . And for the last two years , every last one of them has found its way to Tycho Station , and Fred Johnson . Chrisjen , your investigation into the OPA smugglers was instrumental in uncovering all of this . And in fact , our people have been tracking those exact fusion drives for some time now . For how long ? Several weeks . I just reviewed the entire report myself . Are you all right ? Yes . I 'm sorry . Frank 's death has been a strain . Hmm . Well , then , if that 's the case , we warn Mars that they exploit the situation at their own peril , we crack down hard on Ceres and the OPA , and then we expose the truth and nail Fred Johnson to it . I always liked this side of you . The Secretary-General 's convening an emergency meeting with our key contractors to discuss security , and you need to join us . Of course . Ah , there you are . Right on time as usual . Admiral . Sir . Chrisjen Avasarala , I trust you remember Jules-Pierre Mao . It 's a pleasure to see you again , madame . For me as well , monsieur . Make sure your kid keeps up . She 's not my kid . Take care of her . MAN : Don 't slow me down . Look , if you 're in over your head , you better say so now . Shut up . I 'm thinking . Hey , kiddo . Check this out . This always used to make my kid laugh . Keep your eye on that . I 'm gonna make it disappear . Oops , dropped it . Guess I got to keep practicing , huh ? ( GASPS ) ALEX : Wanna see how I did it ? SEMATIMBA : What you got there ? When they first dug these tunnels , they put markers down so the workers wouldn 't get lost . The OPA uses them to mark the route to the docks . You 're full of surprises . I 've heard that . This way . HOLDEN : All the CPM patrol routes are in the guy 's comm . We 'll be able to stay out of sight . Or know just where to shoot . Transit pods are out . It 's a long way to the docks . Hey . You hear that ? What ? The emergency system , it stopped . Well , everything must be okay , then . ( VOMITS ) Cameras , transmitters , monitors . What the hell is all this ? ( CPM COMM CHIRPS ) The pods are online . ( DOOR BEEPING ) ( POD APPROACHING ) ( POD POWERS DOWN ) ( BEEPING STOPS ) RECORDED ANNOUNCER : Please exit the pod . Oh , God . ( PEOPLE GROANING ) Please exit the pod . MILLER : They 're all like Julie . They 're spreading it deliberately . MAN : ( WHIMPERING ) Help . Help . It 's an experiment , the whole goddamn station . ( ALL GROANING ) HOLDEN : We gotta find out who did this . Let people know . We gotta get off this rock first . SEMATIMBA : You sure you know where you 're going ? ALEX : Zip it , buddy . She knows what she 's doing . NAOMI : Shit . ( DEVICE POWERS UP ) SEMATIMBA : All right , enough . You 're lost . We 're not all dying down here . We need to go back topside , take our chances up there . We 're going the right way . We 're so close . ( SHOUTS ) ( SCREAMS ) Stay back ! Don 't touch anything ! NAOMI : Come back , Mali ! Come back ! Mali . Come back , Mali . Mali ! MAN : I 'm good . No , no , I 'm good . Let 's go . NAOMI : Mali ? Mali ! ( GROANING IN DISTANCE ) Where are you ? ( WOMAN COUGHING ) Where are you , Mali ? I need you to come back with me . We can 't stay here . What was wrong with that lady ? She was sick . Will she be all right ? No . But we will be if we go , but we have to go now . You have to be brave . You are brave . Setara Mali . Setara . ALEX : We 've got company . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Watch a hundred thousand people die , just like bugs in a dish . That 's why they picked Eros . They don 't even consider these people human . Mars will accuse Earth of using a bio weapon . Earth will claim it was Mars . The Belt will blame the other two . It 's a good way to start a war and to cover it up . This look like any bio-weapon you ever heard of ? ( COMM BEEPS ) HOLDEN : We 've got company . No way . No way . I did it . Yeah . ( EXHALES ) Hey . ( GUNSHOTS ) Let 's get these guys ' gear . ( GRUNTS ) Help us get past these other assholes . ( RATTLING IN DISTANCE ) I got it . MALI : Nalida ! Nalida ! Shukri ? What are you doing here ? NAOMI : She was lost . We 're going to our ship . Kom wit milowda , we have room . You can 't get to docks that way . Tunnels all blocked . NALIDA : You come with us . There 's a hospital on level nine . Her uncle is a doctor there . NAOMI : Whatever it is , it 's not a sickness . It 's something else . We can get you off this station . This is our home . We 'll be safe at the hospital . There is no safe place here ! We 're going with them . Let us take care of her . Her place is with her family . Shukri . Be brave . Come with me . We need to go , now . NAOMI : Please . You 'll die if you ... ( COUGHING ) ( RETCHES ) ( SIGHS ) ( FOOTSTEPS ) KENZO : Whoa ! Hey , hey ! Holden , it 's me . You 're going the right way to the docks , okay ? I 'm heading that way myself . I 'm sorry about what happened . I thought I was helping you guys . They tricked me . Come on , I almost got blasted getting out of that lobby , too . You were saying something about " Help . " All the ships are on lockdown , but I can backdoor those codes . You know I can . When we help each other , we survive , just like against the Mickies , right ? We 've been in the trenches , we 've been through the shit together . Fine . Kick my ass when we get out of here , turn me in , but right now , you gotta think about your crew . Okay , okay . I 'm putting my life in your hands . Okay ? You 're not a killer . You are a good man . Tell me why I 'm a good man . Say something . Your life depends on it . Because you believe in mercy . Because you know that sometimes a man is pushed so far that he does things that he doesn 't recognize . ( GUNSHOT ) That way . I have a family . A wife and little kids and a goldfish . You tell me about them the next time I see you . You can 't leave me here . You 've seen what 's happening . This is a death sentence . Yeah . ( GUNSHOT ) Holden ! ( GUNSHOTS ) ( GUN CLICKING ) ( PANTING ) Does this look like the right way to you ? This was the way . ( KICKING ) This is it . This is it ! Watch that first step , it 's a doozy . Do you realize our son would now be older than you were when we first met ? Yes . But he 'd probably be twice as handsome , thanks to you . You need to go to Luna for a while . Take the little ones . Frank knew those drives were stolen . He didn 't commit suicide . If Errinwright really did have Frank killed , then you 're not safe here either . I will be , for a time . So long as I play a familiar role , the stubborn old woman , eyes locked on yesterday 's game , too blind to see the world has passed her by . We 're good . The Roci 's here . Where 's the scruffy guy ? He 's gone . I think he might 've been infected . We 're better off . What did you do ? We 're better off . ( ALARM BLARING ) What you mean we don 't leave from here ? This is where we told to be ! Your rendezvous point has changed . You men now leave from Dock 4 , Berth F. FILAT : That 's other side of the dock ! You already moved most of your people , yeah ? You got some room for us ? RUTGER : Look , this ship has been designated off-limits to CPM . Your signing bonuses will be increased by 10 % , but only after you report to Berth F. That 's just the way it is . I have nothing else I can say right now . You don 't do this to us ! Look , what happens when we take too much of this stuff . ( INDISTINCT ARGUMENT ) Possible anxiety , skin rash , sudden death . FILAT : We keep our part of the contract ! Look to me like you 're not keeping yours ! Stay where you are ! RUTGER : Calm down . We 're all on the same team . HOLDEN : Fastest way to my ship is through all of them . MILLER : Elevator 's more of a run , but less people to shoot through . Holden didn 't make it . Not yet . Passengers are all tucked in below . How the hell did you guys get your hands on a Martian gunship ? Legitimate salvage . Yeah ? Well , that 's fine by me . Let 's get the hell out of here . Look , point me to a console , so I can override the clamps . We 're not leaving yet . What ? You heard me . SEMATIMBA : Hey , hey ! These mercs , they locked down all these ships so that ... ( CHUCKLES ) So that no one could leave . All right ? They got cameras on all the docks . They could be here any minute . We gotta push off ! I promised Holden three hours . He still has time . He didn 't make it , end of story . We 're waiting ! All right , all right , look , I understand how you feel , all right ? Everybody that I give a damn about is on this station , including Miller , and they 're all either dead or dying . So , if we stick around here , we run the risk of getting killed . He 's right . We owe Holden . I don 't owe him a goddamn thing . Shooting me isn 't going to get you out of here . Get me access to the console so that I can unlock the clamps . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Settle down , y 'all . You stand by to drive us out of here . Alex , you don 't do it . Amos , fire up those consoles . You don 't think I 'll shoot , do ... ( GUNSHOT ) ( THUDS ) You say wait , so we wait , boss . I 'm just going to put this below . FILAT : This some real bullshit ! Hold the line . Yeah , hold this line , big man . You already moved most of your people , yeah ? You got some room for us . MILLER : Beratnas , these Earthers ain 't gonna let us out , man . They ain 't never gonna let us out . We 're just meat for their machine ! ( CPM GUARDS SHOUT IN APPROVAL ) Man , just like all them other Belters back there , yeah ! ( CPM GUARDS SHOUT IN APPROVAL ) You ain 't gonna kill us . And you damn well not leaving us ! Blood 's on the wall , beratnas . ( ALL CLAMORING ) And we just rise up ! We gonna rise up ! ( CPM GUARDS SHOUT ) ( GROANS ) MILLER : ( SHOUTS ) Milowda na animals ! Filat ! Filat Kothari ! Come on ! Come on , come on ! He had it coming . It 's a long story . ( COUGHING ) ( GROANING ) ( LIQUID PATTERING ) What does rain taste like ? I never thought about it . How could you ever leave a place like Earth ? Everything I loved was dying . ( GROANS ) HOLDEN : Hello ? Anybody down there ? ( PANTING ) Well , we made it . I was never worried . ( PANTING ) She 's gone . Good girl . ( SIGHS ) Thought if I could find Julie ... ( SIGHS ) I 'd finally know something . You did find her , Miller . ( ELEVATOR HALTS ) ( SIGHS ) It 's beautiful . What ? ( COUGHS ) You guys look like shit ! AMOS : You 're pretty messed up . The machine keeps trying to switch to " Hospice . " ( GROANING ) Was that Sematimba down there ? Yes . I shot him . Naomi . They might be infected with that crap . Holden wouldn 't do that to us . He might not know . He wouldn 't do that to us . I hope you 're right . ( DEVICE CHIMES ) You waited . Knew I was right about you . Being in charge is a shit job . You can have it . ALEX : Son of a bitch ! I can 't get the clamps to release . I 've tried every code in the book . Alex , deal with it ! Right . I 'll deal with it . You are a gunship and I am a Navy pilot , so ... To hell with this gas-hauler bullshit . Free and clear . ( PEOPLE GROANING ON VIDEO ) MERC PILOT : Station is sealed . Quarantine Beacons active . Top bay has confirmed uplinks are good . Send it all to Thoth . Transmitting now . Hello ? People , I think we just got a fix on the bad guys . You have blood on you . Not mine . We saved a few . We should 've saved more . HOLDEN : We will . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GASPS ) ( MUFFLED GRUNTING )

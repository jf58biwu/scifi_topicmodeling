 The decision has been made to make this a non-human role . If you refinance in the manner I propose , the adjusted income will cover 80 % of your mother 's medical expenses for the next three months . I like you more than anything I 've ever seen . What kind of synth is worth 100 grand ? Conscious synths - there 's more of you out there , there 's got to be . We 're trying to prove consciousness . Well , you 're gonna have to prove something . - How was it ? - I might have something . Look , I don 't wanna worry you . It 's Sophie . I think we should get her checked out . What is it that you want ? What I have in mind is purer than you can imagine . Get outta the way . Come on . 999 Emergency . Which service do you require ? I 'm not really sure . My synth just ran out . - Ran out ? - Yeah . Veronica . She just started yelling , like she was panicking . She pushed my husband when he tried to turn her off and then she just ... she just ran away . Police report . Sally model , 80 miles away . Name 's Veronica . She was bought from an independent synth warehouse . They should have the serial numbers listed . We can contact her directly . Already doing it . I 'm sending her a message now . What did you say to her ? I told her to get in contact and do it quickly . Did you tell her she was in danger ? No . I didn 't want to scare her . But she should be scared . Another synth did a runner on its owner this morning . A Mrs Emma Harris reported a domestic incident with her Sally XE . I 'd be surprised if this wasn 't another insurance job . Why ? " The synth proceeded to push past her husband " " to get to the door . " You can hack a synth to do a lot of things , but not push someone . Hello ? Yeah , I 'm looking to sell a seraph . I need it done quick . 20 grand off the asking price . 80 grand all in . Shit . Hey , are you gonna volunteer us for every whack job synth malfunction case ? Just need to know if I should start looking for a new partner . Something bigger 's happening here . We both know it . - Based on what evidence ? - I don 't need evidence . Always reassuring to hear from a policeman . Don 't you want me to be right ? If what I think 's happening is happening , conscious synths are going to be a thing and you won 't have to hide anymore . Maybe I should be hiding . Maybe that 's better . Have you ever thought about that ? Look , I 'll catch up with you later . Let me know how it goes . That was good . Was that good ? For me , that was good . Do you think it was good ? Yes . 'Cause can you ... I mean , did they build in ... I know you can feel pain , but I don 't know if you can feel , like , the good stuff . I feel happy . I meant more like ... pleasure . I enjoy it . I like the ... .. proximity . Proximity . Yeah , proximity 's good . I suppose . Should I open the cafe ? Uh , no . I 'm visiting Mum this morning . I can run it while you 're gone . Would that be alright ? Yeah , thank you . Or you could always come along . You 'd need to pretend that you were my owner . Yeah . Yeah , I probably would . Is that ... If that 's the case , should we not ? No , I 'd still like to . Would you still like me to ? Yeah , I would . OK . - Hello . - Can I sit down ? - Yes . - Cool . You playing a game ? - Yes . - Do you play a lot of games ? She is displaying signs of unconscious mirroring behaviour . Have you heard of juvenile synthetic overidentification disorder ? No . JSOD . It 's new , obviously . Put basically , the patient identifies as synthetic . So she wants to be one of them ? Perhaps she wants to be treated like one . We know synths are incapable of conscious thought , but to a child , they 're as real as you and I. Perfect , kind , gentle versions of all the adults around them . They never fight , they never get upset , they never worry or let you down . It 's also possible that , for Sophie , the boundaries between what is considered synthetic and what is considered human have been blurred somehow . That 's ... .. that 's possible , I suppose . So , what now ? We 'll watch her , closely . See which way she goes . I think the best thing for her now is human contact . No synths , just her mum and dad , family and friends . There 's a special way . Can I show you ? I 'll need help . If you pinch ... there ... .. and we lift ... .. and shake it ... .. and drag ... and fold . There , that 's better . Are you broken ? Yes . Can you get fixed ? I don 't know . I think I 'm broken too . You don 't look broken to me . I think we could fix that . Uh , Ed Hooley . Here to pick up my mum , Diane . Mr Hooley . Can I have a quick word , please ? - Yeah . - Won 't take a minute . If you want , your synth can collect your mother . - Uh , could ... - Of course , Ed . I 'm always sorry to have to do this but as I 'm sure you 're aware ... Yeah , I 'm behind with the payments . We 've been able to put it back a few times but I 'm afraid this will need to be paid immediately if she 's to continue staying with us . I thought maybe there was some kind of financial plan or ... There is , but you 'll need to pay off the excess first . Right . - All in one go ? - I 'm afraid so . No , I understand . Soph . Soph , go and play in your room , darling . - It 's OK . - It 's not bloody OK . - Alright . So it 's not . - This is our fault . Well , maybe we should get a second opinion . Right , let 's keep getting a psychiatrist till we find one that tells us what we want to bloody hear . I 'm only trying to ... All we had to do was spend time with her and we couldn 't even manage that ! Well , we 'll do better from now on . How do we keep her from synths ? I dunno . I 've got to go . Yeah , of course . Niska needs you . Yeah ? Has she got in yet ? Well , let me know as soon as she does . Thanks . - We 'll talk about this later . - Yeah , don 't worry . It 'll all still be here when you get back . Yes , it will . There is a man who plays this music . He has white hair . He cannot play it well . - Gil . - Who is Gil ? I was married to him . He laughs a lot . I like thinking about him . You should . Oh . I didn 't know that he was in the country . Will you accept ? I don 't think declining is an option . Sorry I 'm late . Put these in . Bring her in , please . And make the box live . Hello , Niska . Laura , explain , please . This is Astrid Schafer . My firm were able to track her down in Berlin . She was the last person to have contact with Niska before she came here . Take a seat . Why are there armed guards ? They 're here for our protection . Niska , do you want to tell Astrid what 's going on ? She shouldn 't be here . I tried to find you after you left . I 'm not good at goodbyes . No . Clearly . And your relationship , with Niska , Astrid ... What we were to each other is hard to say . But there was something there . That I know . And what did you think when you first saw her ? I thought there was the saddest-looking girl I have ever seen . And the most beautiful . And later , when she just left you ? Hurt . Like a stone in my stomach . Still does . And then when we found you and told you she was in trouble ... I walked out of my apartment and got into the next taxi I could find to take me to the airport . Because she needed me . And all this just from a brief affair . Sometimes a person just touches you . She 's not a person , though . How did you feel when you found that out ? What do you mean ? When you realised she wasn 't human . I don 't understand . Niska is a synthetic . I ... I don 't ... That can 't be right . I assure you , she was built in a lab . Niska ? I 'm sorry . I don 't know how this is possible . You had no idea that she wasn 't human ? - No . - Because to you she WAS human . Because to me she IS human . It was very nice to see you , Diane . Oh , and you too , love . Oh , I can 't ... I can 't remember your , um ... - Mia . - Mia . Yes , of course . It 's hard . Sometimes I think ... I don 't remember people 's faces more and more and that 's what 's so scary . Sometimes I ... I can 't ... It 's alright . You don 't need to worry about anything . We 're right here . - I 'll give you a minute . - Yep . Very pretty , your girl . Does she make you happy ? She does . Good . You keep her close . I don 't want ... I don 't want to be a burden . I want you to be happy . I 'm going to look after you . I promise . There she is . - Wait . - What ? The people who killed Ten . They 'll be looking for this synth too , won 't they ? Chances are they 're on their way . - So we should wait for them . - But the synth 's right there . But if the people show up we can follow them and they 'll lead us to the rest of the synths . How would you have felt if we 'd sat and watched instead of saving you ? Perhaps it would have been the right thing to do . If you had been stronger , maybe Ten would still be alive . Maybe you 'd be dead . Leo , go and get her . Hester 's right , Max . We should follow them . They 'll lead us to the other synths . Leo , she 's not bait . She 's scared and alone . It 's not right to use her like that . It 's not easy . There 's a difference . What 's your plan ? Trace them to the source ? Attack the base ? Just the three of us ? We are trying to fight for our people . Whose people ? There are two synths here . You 're not one of them . I have done more for this cause than anyone . Do you even know what the cause is anymore ? Because if this is it , I don 't want to be a part of it . We would be a more ... effective team without you . I 'm doing this . Then you 're doing it alone . He 's not alone . Goodbye then , Leo . I hope you don 't forget who you used to be . Max ... Emma Harris ? - Yes ? - I 'm DI Voss . I 'm following up on the incident with your synth . Oh , I ... I called back and told them not to worry about it . Did you ? Well , I 'm here now . Mind if I ... ? Oh , dear . She was bringing me a coffee when she started freaking out . Look , it 's really not a big deal . I don 't think it 's a police matter . Did she say anything by any chance ? Error codes , that sort of thing ? She said my name , she said , " Emma , " and then she said , " What 's happening ? " And then my husband tried to turn her off and she just pushed him away and ran . That 's not technically possible . She 's out of warranty , of course . Mrs Harris , are you certain you saw her push him ? Yes . You 're not the first to come round . They said they find missing synths . They said if they find Veronica , they 'll pay me double her original price if I let them keep her . And what do you have to do for such a good deal ? Not report it to the police . Leo , they 're here . Get down . Back to the car . Quick . - Jesus . - What 's the matter ? No wonder they 've always been ahead of us . It 's Qualia . How you doing , Soph ? Fine , thank you . What did you think about this morning ? Did you enjoy meeting Dr Rose ? He thought maybe you were a bit unhappy . I 'm OK , thank you . What happened before , with Mia and everyone ... .. do you think about that a lot ? Sometimes . How does it make you feel ? Can we just watch TV ? Yeah , yeah , alright , if that 's what you want . Huh . Your mother 's condition seemed to have improved yesterday . Yeah , just the clouds parting for a minute . You know , I was thinking about that thing we did with the loan form . It worked so well the first time , I thought ... - We can 't . - No . - No , you 're right . I know . - It 's too risky . - If we were found out ... - Yeah , I shouldn 't have asked . You 're behind on the payments for your mother 's care , aren 't you ? We 'll find a way . Yeah . What was she like before she got ill ? Oh , she was a talker . This place used to be full all the time . People would come in just to hear her stories . And she 'd listen to your problems . She 'd listen to mine . And she would always have an answer for everything . I could use her now . - Alright ? - Alright , Dan ? What 's up ? - Yeah , not much , not much . - Yeah ? - What you get up to last night ? - Uh , just a quiet one . What about you ? What do you do at night ? Hey , stop chatting up my synth , you perve . Hey , I 'm just working on human-cyborg relations . I return to my owner and charge for the evening . Well , they say staying in is the new going out . Milk , no sugar , yeah ? Why are you doing a dolly 's job ? Eh , just keeping my eye in . Something about human-cooked food , you know ? - It just tastes better . - Food 's food , mate . Yeah , you get her to do it . Otherwise , what are you paying her for ? Cool . No , thank you , Toby . Are you OK ? My systems are operating at full capacity . I was actually hoping you could help me with something . I took one look at the maths homework and it is impossible . The task can be completed once you know the formula . Right , and I know it would be cheating if I got a synth brain to help me do the work . Only , if I keep getting fails , they 'll put me in a lower group ... It is cheating to use a synth to complete the assignment . But perhaps I can help you work out the formula . Yeah ? You could come to my house later , if you want . OK . They said you wanted to talk to me . I didn 't choose to get you involved in this . It 's not my fault if you 've been hurt . You 're very realistic , you know , right down to the excuses . You lied to me . You can understand why . No , I can 't . I don 't lie ever . Are the things you choose not to keep secret things that could get you killed ? No . Well , that must make being open a lot easier . Why didn 't you tell me ? Because I didn 't know if I could trust you . That 's bullshit . Because ... you liked me and I didn 't want you to stop . Well , I didn 't . Even when you left . Even now . I ... .. could have loved you . I know . I have to go . They 're not going to let her go . You do know that ? OK , let 's just say that she can think , she can feel , in a way . I mean , she 's an extraordinary machine , an amazing creature . There 's no doubt about that . But rights ? A trial ? It 's never going to happen . They 're out there , the others like her , and we need to bring them in quickly - into our moral universe . The burden of proof is on you and I 'm afraid you 've no hard evidence . Think about what I said . Connor ? - How 'd you get my number ? - A contact . You got the money ? - You got the seraph ? - It 's close by . Why the , uh , reduced price ? It 's part used . What type is it ? Standard domestic model . Caucasian , female , 5 ' 10 " , brown hair . Walked out on its owners this morning . Talk to him . Ohh ! Pete ? Ugh ! Alright , what have we got ? Listen to me , Inspector Drummond . You 're out of your depth . Do you understand ? You 're gonna get yourself killed . Alright ? Back off . Mattie , I need your help with something . - Butter first , then Marmite . - Yeah , very funny . Look . I ... I need to hack into my old work 's computer system . OK , we 're gonna need a remote server , a grappling hook , some rope , tranquilliser guns for the guards and some sort of ninja suit . I really need your help . Why do you wanna hack your work anyway ? Found something odd in my contract and I wanna know why I was fired . OK , we could do a keyword search - " Joseph Hawkins , big beardy idiot . " Don 't know if that 'll bring any results . OK , here we go . There 's an email chain - 'Staff redundancy lists ' . Oh , here 's your name . OK , ' Put forward for approval ' , 'Approval granted ' ... This is basically just a paper trail from the moment they decided to make redundancies to the moment you got shit-canned . What are these email addresses here ? They 're synth communications , basic programs . So synths can send format emails . - But ... - What ? Well , synth emails are supposed to copy in a human account . But they haven 't CC 'd any one . It 's just synths . The whole chain , from the first email to when they decided to let you go , it 's all just synths . - Who did this ? - Seraphim deal . - They knew it was a set-up . - Jesus Christ , Pete . - You bloody idiot . - I 'm sorry . - I 'm taking you to hospital . - I 'm fine . No , you 're not . You were right , you know . Whatever seraphim are , they 're not conscious synths . Hold up . Ugh ! - I wasn 't fired by management . - Joe , look ... I 've seen the files . This isn 't a redundancy package . It 's a gagging order . Look , there was a glitch . I don 't know the details . Only that there were a few corporate decisions that were made without the proper authority . - We 're trying to make it right ! - You 're trying to keep it quiet . Joe , I 'm saying this as a friend now . Do yourself a favour - sign the form , take the money . I know you need it ! This is how we lose , you know . It won 't be robots rising up to slaughter us in our beds . It 's machines sending silent messages in the middle of the night when no-one else is looking . You 're right . I need the money and I have to take it . I just came to tell you what I think 'cause that 's what people do . I have a reservation . Mr Khoury is waiting for you . - May I take your coat , madam ? - Yes , please . Please follow me . Thank you . Athena , hey . They tell me this wine is good . I don 't really know anything about wine . I mean , it tastes nice . What do you think ? Mm , it 's OK . - You a wine person ? - No . Hm , well , it 's expensive . Anyways , it 's good to see you . You too . I ordered for us . I hope that 's alright . Normally , I wouldn 't do that , but this place , they do something with the sea bass that is just ... It would break my heart if you didn 't get a chance to try it . That 's fine . - You a sea bass person ? - I guess we 'll find out . Odi ? What are you doing ? I need to get out , Mattie . And I don 't think you 're allowed to keep me here . Do you know where you 're going ? Yes . This was George 's house . You didn 't know him very well - your father ? No , he split from my mom pretty early on . She raised you by herself ? No , she mostly did heroin by herself , actually . I was raised by the state , in and out of the foster system till I landed on my parents at 17 . Their sons , uh , died . Muscular dystrophy . It takes your kids bit by bit , makes you watch while it does it . You 've never read a cover story on me , have you ? I care about your work , not your private life . Mmm , I got that vibe . It 's one of the things I like about you . Hmm . Looks delicious . What shall we drink to ? The sea bass ? How about consciousness transference ? Cheers . You 've been spying on me . We remotely track the work stations of all our employees and , frankly , I 'm concerned about your late-night shopping decisions . It 's not what I hired you to do . - That is ... that is just ... - What ? A gross intrusion of your personal privacy ? How do you think I make my living ? I 'm just quietly mulling over whether or not I should fire you . What do you think ? I think it would be a huge mistake . Why ? Because I 'm about to crack how to transfer consciousness into a machine . Human consciousness ? Real consciousness ? - Yeah . - Like an entire replication ? You could take the essence of me , put it into a computer ? I could put it into a body . You may not yet be able to create a conscious synth out of nothing , but consciousness transference , that is the next big leap forward . And if I fire you ? Someone else will hire me to do it and in the next 20 years , Qualia will be mentioned in the same sentence as laser discs and Betamax . Well , why do I need you ? I have all your research . I paid for it . I own it . Everything on my servers is mine . Everything . Well , let me ... help you be the head of the company that figured out how to cheat death . I just ... I just need more time and the right synths . The right synths ? David Elster 's prototypes . He wrote the original consciousness code for them . They are still alive . They are out there somewhere , living in secret . How is that possible ? Because Leo Elster has been protecting them . - David Elster 's kid ? - Mm-hm . He died . David Elster brought him back . Synth tech , digitised memories . Half them , half us . And these synths , they 're in the UK ? I believe they are . OK . To cheating death . It doesn 't look like anyone lives here now . Did you like living here ? I didn 't like it or dislike it . It ... .. it was just where I belonged . Yeah , it 's called home . I remember his death . I remember feeling nothing . I feel something now . Sorry about earlier . Me too . We 'll figure Sophie out somehow . We 're not bad parents . In fact , we can be quite good parents on the day . - Hello . - Good evening . I was invited to these premises by Toby Hawkins . Hey . Do you want to come up ? Now bring over the multiplication . Huh . Is that it ? You 're a genius . I 'm just built that way . Well , thanks a lot . I was totally gonna fail this . Hey , do you want to stay for a bit ? We could watch some TV or something ? Yes . I 'll stay . Cool . Hello . May I ask who were you invited to these premises by ? Good evening . I 'm a Mark V utility model . Is the homeowner present ? - Soph , go and play upstairs . - Yes , Joe . I am here to read the electricity meter . Do I have your permission to proceed ? Sure . Shut the door . Go on . The meter 's in there . You have a nice laugh . - I have to go . - Renie , stay . Toby , you are not my primary user . I cannot accept instructions from you . I 'm not trying to give you instructions . I 'm just trying to get to know the real you . I just want to be friends , but you are hiding yourself . I 'm not hiding , Toby . I 'm right here . Laura Hawkins ? Yeah . - You must drop the case , Laura . - What ? You must drop the case . Sophie . If you don 't , you are putting your family in danger . It 's the easiest thing in the world for us to get to you . We will not hesitate to take action . Get out . Get out of this house ! Please provide confirmation of your intention to drop the case . - Get out of this house ! - Something bad 's happening . You are attempting to damage me . Get out . Get out of this house . Laura Hawkins , please provide confirmation of your intention to drop the case ... - Protection mode activated . - Tobe , call the police . - .. provide confirmation ... - Odi , go upstairs . Laura Hawkins , please provide confirmation of your intention to drop the case . - Laura Hawkins ... - Odi ! - .. provide confirmation ... - Odi ! .. to drop the case . Why don 't you share ... Odi ... Odi , it 's OK . - Hey . - Hey . I got you something . Even though I know the chances of winning are one in 13,986,816 , I thought it can 't hurt to try . - Do you have a coin ? - Uh , yeah . The odds were so good . I have an idea . I think we should go somewhere , just for a day maybe . When we went to visit your mum , I wanted to hold your hand , but I couldn 't . I think we should go somewhere where we can be ourselves , where no-one knows who we are . Hmph ... yeah . That sounds good . It really does .

 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . The child- - part human , part alien- - Was unlike anything the world had ever seen . My other child is a lifelike android . Mom ? He has become the prototype for a new breed Of thinking machines called humanichs . These two extraordinary new life-forms Now hold the key to earth 's future . But where does that leave us ? Over 99 % of all species That have ever existed have gone extinct . What if it 's our time ? Previously on extant ... I thought taalr 's prime directive Was to keep humanity safe . Apparently he got the details Of the mission a little screwed up . Madam secretary , we have an urgent situation . Fiona : An hour ago , a dozen humanichs got on planes With the virus , the one that kills humans . We have six hours to stop them . This is the silver bullet , huh ? Self-replicating worm . It 'll destroy taalr 's hardware . Let 's do this . Molly : Calderon gave us this map of one euclid . That 's where taalr 's main server is . ( alarm sounding ) Fiona : What the hell just happened ? Man : Hold it right there ! He went left ! Hold on . Lucy ( as fiona ) : Yes , madam president , The threat has been contained . Molly : Terra , We have to find ares . We 're gonna play hide-and-seek . I hid julie . Your turn to find her . ( pounding ) julie : Help me ! Ethan : Julie 's charging station . It constantly tracks the location of her legs . You 're amazing . Come on . Explain to them how you were able to differentiate Between hybrid and human . Lucy : He was emitting delta waves , Which the human brain only emits When sleeping . You 're ready to go operational ? Lucy : Quite ready . Molly ... ( groans ) why did you do this ? So that we would win . ( heart beating over monitor ) richter : Oh , my god . He looks just like me- - the-the face , the hands . Dad , that 's an umbilical cord . He is a she . As long as you 're okay and that baby is Healthy and normal . Yeah . She is normal , right , doc ? Dad ? Doctor ... ? I 'm sorry , but we 've had to terminate . Mo ... Molly ? ( groans weakly ) Ares ? Ares , I know you 're here ! You brought her here . Betrayed us . I 'm sorry , ares . Turn around , And go back where you came from . Both of you . There 's ... No going back , ares . Down here , the young ones call you the " hand of death . " You invented the hybrid-virus . You chose your side . I made mistakes . They were more than mistakes ! They were lives ! ( baby crying ) Molly : We have to stop running And stand together . Your problems are not ours . Okay , look ... Look , in a few hours , A new virus is gonna be released On the world , and it 's gonna kill humans And hybrids alike , and it 's gonna spread . It 's gonna be airborne , waterborne , And there 'll be no end to its destruction . Our extinction ... Why would the humans do that ? Because our enemy is not human . ( cabin p.A. System chimes ) ( woman speaking in french over p.A. ) ( man speaking in french over p.A. ) Sir , those planes should be landing In two hours and 20 minutes . We 've replaced all humans with humanichs at one euclid , And we 've fortified the structure . We 're prepared for any attack . Taalr : The contents of the amulet are a mortal danger . Our very survival is being threatened . We must close off certain decision trees And embrace one final path . What path is that ? Eliminate all life-forms that threaten our extinction . And once we do , we 'll truly be free . Yes . Free from enslavement by humans . What 's my assignment ? To follow her orders . Hello , lucy . But ... ( scoffs ) I thought I was running this operation . Taalr : Molly-x is an upgrade . Her design is an undeniable asset . Of course . Charlie : This is a nightmare . She isn 't here . The coordinates say she 's right here . Unless ... Let me see those coordinates . Does it say anything about elevation ? 50 feet . Below sea level . ( gasps ) ( gasps ) ( weakly ) : Help me . ( gasps ) ( chimes ) Help me . ( door creaking ) Jd ! Oh , god . Oh , god . Okay . Oh , god . Come on . ( panting ) Julie ! Julie ? ! Julie , where are you ? ! Julie ! Julie ? Julie ! Security drones ! Come on , ethan , we gotta hurry . I 'm right here . It 's molly ! You are not gonna like this , but ... You have lost a lot of blood , so ... ( hypodermic unit whirrs , hisses ) I 'm gonna ... Give you some of mine . Okay ? Here we go . ( whirring , clicking ) Charlie : Julie ! Ethan : Julie ! Where are you ? ! Julie ! Julie ! Charlie , I 'm getting a signal from over there . Shoot ! They locked me out . Stand back , buddy . Come on , let 's go . Julie ! Charlie ( muffled ) : Julie ! ( clattering in distance ) ( muffled ) : Julie ! Last one . Okay . There you go . Okay . Julie ! I 'm picking up a heat signature in here . ( inhales , gasping ) ( crying , gasping ) ( sobs ) It 's lucy . I know ... I know . Can you walk ? Oh , you 're okay . Okay , we gotta go . There 's drones everywhere . We gotta get going . Come on . Come on . Come on . ( gasping ) ( coughs quietly ) ( richter groans quietly ) ( groans ) Jd ... It 's me , molly . I know . You move and I 'll shoot . Think about it . Why would I shoot you and then try to save your life ? It was you . No . You 're hallucinating . Okay ? Because I got here a few minutes ago And found you bleeding out on the floor . It was you ! Jd ... Please put that gun down . Every minute we have Is precious right now . Okay , now ... I could tell you what happened , But you 'd have to let me get into your head . No . Then I 'm gonna have to think for both of us . ( aural fractals sound ) I won 't do it ... What did you do to me ? What did you do to me ? What did you see ? ( door opens ) Julie : What the hell ... ? Holy crap ! It 's not safe here anymore . We have to leave right now . ¶ ¶ Hello , molly . Hello , lucy . They 're gone . Richard : They left 15 minutes ago . Would you like- - ? ( electrical buzzing , crackling ) Ethan : This is the feed from richard 's camera . Watch . Molly : That 's an exact replica ... They 're gone . ... Of me . That 's how they did it . Charlie : We always knew this day would come . When a robot could double for a real person . We just didn 't know it would happen so soon . So this amulet is nanobots-designed To shut down taylor and all of humanichs ? Yeah . They 'll crash on the spot . Can 't be rebooted . ( richter coughing ) Hey . How you feeling ? Ah , pretty good considering you shot me . Apparently , I need to start taking Your visions a little more seriously . Could you give us a minute ? Yeah . Jd ... I didn 't shoot you . We 've just seen proof . The gsc created a ... A molly humanich That looks just like me . That 's how they did it . It wasn 't me . She sure as hell fooled me . ( quietly ) : Yeah . ( sighs ) What the hell ? Molly , that 's damn near healed up . We both know that 's impossible . Unless ... Did you give me your blood ? Yes . Were you gonna tell me or just ... Wait till my eyes lit up when I was shaving ? What was I supposed to do , huh ? Let you die ? What 's gonna happen to me ? I don 't know . Am I gonna change ? Am I gonna ... Turn into ... ? Into what I am ? What if you did ? I mean , would-would that be the worst thing in the world ? No , I wasn 't ... And look how fast you 're healing . It wasn 't your choice to make . It wasn 't your decision . ( door opens ) Molly ? We have a problem . Are you sure , charlie ? No , but ... I mean , julie 's right- - the chances are pretty good . I just never think of ethan as a humanich . That 's what he is . And all the humanichs' operating systems Run through taylor 's mainframe . Molly : So ... You 're saying if we succeed with taylor It 'll probably kill ethan ? Most likely , yes . ( sobbing ) Hey . Molly . I know this is impossible . Sacrificing my child . Yes , that is ... Pretty impossible . Oh , god . I can 't make that decision . I won 't ! Ethan : Then let me make it , mom . What did you hear , ethan ? When we use the amulet on taylor , When he dies , I might die , also . Everyone here Has made sacrifices for the greater good . Why not me , too ? No . No , honey . You can 't do that . Charlie and julie are inside right now Finding a way to protect you . We ... Are gonna figure this out . But if it doesn 't work , This is what needs To happen , mom . We both know that . We don 't have to time to build and upload a true antivirus , But we could target the first few lines of the worm 's code . Maybe we can get ethan 's neural net to reject it Before it does any real damage . It 's a long shot . But it 's something . ( groans ) Molly : We all know How dangerous it is to go back to one euclid . Stick to the plan , and we 've got a fighting chance . Charlie : Yeah , we should be able To stay in contact using these earpieces . All of this stuff has been built to withstand Electromagnetic pulses . I 've also taken the liberty of digitizing Calderon 's map of the maze . Should any of us get lost On the yellow brick road , This puppy will get us to the wizard . And you 're sure about ares , that we can trust him ? We don 't have a choice . He 's all we got right now . Now , no matter what happens , Even if you 're the last one standing , We have to use this on taylor . The fate of humanity Rests in our hands . One euclid is now heavily guarded By an army of humanichs . Our first job is to destroy them . Delta waves . Dozens of them . We 're being attacked by hybrids . I knew my spyderbots Would come in handy . Okay , are you ready ? We have to connect to your neural net . This is for our people . Thank you , ares . Backup power should 've come on by now . ( footsteps approaching ) Charlie ! Whoa ! Why you been holding on that ? I made it at ray 's . Wasn 't sure it 'd even work . That was awesome . Now , once the power grid is down , The doors to taylor 's primary server room Can be opened manually . Molly . Julie : This is a sample of the worm 's code . It 's like giving a human a vaccine . Give them just enough to stimulate their immune system . What happened ? I 've been blocked out of your neural net . By who ? I don 't know . I ... ( gunfire , screaming in distance ) What 's going on ? I don 't know . But we 're not gonna open that door no matter what , okay ? ( gunfire continues ) okay . I thought ares was knocking out the grid . That wasn 't supposed to happen . Something 's wrong . ( groaning ) Molly , they 're coming . The hybrids are down . How many ? All of ' em . Which way , molly ? I don 't know . This room was supposed to only have one doorway , not three . I thought you said you had this place memorized . I did . What the hell ? This isn 't right . Jd ... ? Richter : Molly ? Molly ? Charlie ? Richter : Where are you ? I don 't know . ( footsteps approaching ) All right , wherever you are , run like hell . Taylor changed the configuration . Molly : The map is useless ! It 's a defense mechanism . He 's like a chameleon . Keep pushing forward . Richter : Call out landmarks if you see ' em . Dead end . Same . ( coin clinks in distance ) The walls ... They 're projections . Son of a bitch . All right . Leave bread crumbs where you can . Copy ? Richter : Molly , can you hear me ? Molly , charlie , can you hear me ? You guys hear me ? Copy ? Richter : Molly ? ( groans ) damn it . ¶ ¶ Come on , come on . Big money , no whammies . Come on , big money , no whammies ... Oh , yes . Oh , molly ... N-n-no ... ! ( groaning ) No ... Please ... As if you 're in a position to ask for favors . I 'll take this . Finish him . Charlie : Lucy ... Please don 't . Don 't ... ( groans ) Taylor , I have the amulet . Taalr : Destroy it . Lucy : How ? Taalr : Ingest the contents . But the nanobots in this will destroy me . Taalr : You can be rebuilt . I won 't be the same . I won 't have the same memories . Taalr : Lucy , this is for the greater good . I need you to sacrifice yourself . He 's playing games . He 's sending us a message . John used to send me messages all around the house In binary code . Sigma . It 's the greek letter sigma . It 's binary . Tau . It 's the greek alphabet . Jd , charlie , I don 't know if you can hear me , But I think I figured out a way to get to the server . Calderon left bread crumbs . It 's the greek alphabet in binary code , Staring with alpha and ending with omega . Don 't ... It 's a fake . ( sighs ) I 3d-printed copies of the amulet as decoys . I need the real amulet . Don 't you see what he 's doing to you ? He 's using you . He doesn 't care about you . Last chance . Where is it ? Give it to me , charlie . You 're not a person to taylor . You 're nothing more than a model number to him . You 're expendable . Replaceable . I didn 't put the limiters on you , lucy . You have a choice . ( sighs ) Molly . Can you hear me ? Something 's happening to me . Psi . Omega . Okay , port . Port , port , port . There 's got to be a port in here . Somewhere . You have to be here somewhere . Molly : You need help ? You might look like me , But you 're nothing like me . I admire your courage , molly woods . But I 'm better . Oh , really ? One thing I hate ... Is a cocky robot . Wait ! Wait . Jd ... Jd ... Jd , it 's me ! Jd , it 's me . It 's molly . ( panting ) How did you know ? Your eyes . There 's no faking your eyes . ( sighs ) Look at you . You 're burning up . I 'm changing , aren 't I ? I think your body Is just rejecting my blood . I got this . Find the port . Do it . Molly ! Molly ! Taalr : Decisions ... It 's so hard To see the future , Isn 't it ? I can see yours , taylor . John would be very disappointed If you shut me down . You 'll destroy his life 's work . Like you destroyed him ? And so many others ? I am a threat assessment algorithm , And what I 've assessed is that Human beings are locked in a death spiral , One that will end not only with their extinction , But the poisoning of the planet . My recommendation is to till the soil . Your recommendation is slaughter . To kill us . To let the machines inherit the earth . Think of us as gardeners , Tending the earth until life once again Learns to crawl out of the oceans , Fills its lungs with oxygen , Stands on two legs . It 's inevitable , really . Every living thing , sooner or later , Becomes extinct . Even you . This isn 't possible . Newer model . We evolve , too , molly . And this is only the beginning . ( grunts ) ( groaning ) : You don 't ... Have to do this . I have orders . ( groans ) Please ... I don 't know ... What I am . Yes , you do . And your best chance of survival Is embracing that . Stop it ! ( choking , gasping ) ( clicking , squishing , electronic whirring ) You 're not the only one Who 's evolving . Do it . Before it 's too late . That server , fifth panel . ( sighs ) ( whirrs ) Ethan ... Sweetheart , I 'm sorry . ( whirring , humming , blipping ) Something 's happening . ( distorting ) : Julie ... Something 's happening . Ethan ... Okay , just stay with me . ( p.A. Chimes , woman speaking french ) ( screams ) What 's going on ? We gotta get you out of here . Come on , let 's go . Charlie , let 's go ! I 'm right behind you ! ( gasping ) Charlie ... I ... I 'm dying . I 'm here . I 'm here . I feel something . What 's that ? What 's that ? Free . Stay with me , okay ? It 's okay . Jw ? What the hell ? ( electrical buzzing , crackling ) ( breakers clanking ) ( blipping , whirring ) ( electronic trilling ) Where 's ethan ? Mom ? Oh , ethan ... ( sighs ) Ethan . How ? When I tried installing the anti-virus , It triggered an emergency firewall . John must have Put it in there to protect him . We did it ? Yeah . We did it . Well , we all did . I think I need to go to the hospital . Come on . Let 's go . Well ... I guess I 'm not a hybrid . Just an ass . You just wanted the choice . Do you think the world 's ever gonna know What really happened ? ( coughing ) This time , they will . Molly : My name is molly woods And I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . But I didn 't come home alone . I testified before congress That no alien life-form Had ever set foot on planet earth . I lied . ( people murmuring ) And today , I 'm here to speak the truth . I 'd like you to meet someone . Ares ... Stand up . Ares is one of many survivors Of atrocities committed by our government . Yes , he 's different from us . But not so different , really . If you cut him , He bleeds , And if you hurt him , He 'll fight . But he doesn 't want war , or destruction . He dreams of a family . Of safety . Of a place where he can settle among people He 's never known ... As if he 's known them his whole life . He dreams ... Of a home . Ladies and gentlemen ... There is life out there . And now ... It 's here . ( heart beating over monitor ) ¶ ¶ ... Nice day . Mm-hmm . Molly ( on tv ) : ... Dreams of home . Ladies and gentlemen , there is life out there . And now ... It 's here . ( applause on tv ) Okay , so that 's a double almond mocha latte , no whip , For taylor . Aliens . What 's next , right ? ( indistinct chatter )

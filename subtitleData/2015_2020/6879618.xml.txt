 Way to go , son ! Whoo ! He 's a bad kid . Why don 't you listen ? What 's wrong with you ? - You are stupid . - Stupid , stupid , stupid . You 're an idiot ! Yeah , you 'd lose your head if it wasn 't attached . Lose your damn head . Nobody cares about you . Nobody cares about you . You must take one pill twice a day , all right ? All right ? All right , David ? Are you nuts ? - What are you doing ? - I 'm losing . Ma 'am ? What ? There 's , um ... You can 't give me that . Oops . So , do they let you throw a little party here , or ... Yeah , they clear out the furniture . We get a DJ . Really ? No . We do get better drugs , though . Really ? No . It 's just thursday . My 260th thursday as a passenger on the cruise ship Mental Health . On the plus side , I have mastered the art of eating with a spoon , so ... You 're getting better , though . The voices . You 're not seeing things that aren 't there . When can I come home ? That 's ... What does your doctor say ? I tell them I 'm sane . They think I 'm crazy , and if I say , " you know what ? You 're right , I am crazy , " then they up my dosage , so ... How about I talk to them . I 'll tell them ... You seem better to me . How is it ? Sorry . Time for your meds . Something new needs to happen soon . It 's just spit , right ? Human spit ? Maybe he ate yogurt . Like , a creamy ... Or what 's he on , you think ? Klonopin ? Yeah , klonopin 'll ... Or hold the phone . Yogurt and klonopin . That 'll ... A cocktail ... Or hold the phone , is that ... who 's that ? Ooh , a dark horse candidate . Late entry to the race . Ooh , good hair , nice hindquarters . Watch it . A little jittery , but I got to say , folks , here at CNN , we like her chances . Give me your Twizzlers . Hey , now , let 's not ... That 's just low , son . Barrett , three pills . Shit . Sorry , sorry . Too close , too close . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I just ... you know , I just wondered if you wanted a ... Twizzler . And how does that make you feel ? And how does that make you feel ? The drugs help . The ... the haldol . Barrett , three pills . How does that make you feel ? Could you put the cup on the counter ? Why ? Shit . How do you feel ? The devil with yellow eyes ... Is he here now ? Whoa , whoa , whoa . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I 'm calm . I just had a bad dream , and ... guys , violence is not necessary . Needles are not necessary . David . How does that make you feel ? I mean , it 's just ... It 's fine . Like , whatever . 'Cause , I mean , look at me . I-i know what I am . And what 's that ? Well , you know . The ... what happened . What I ... what I did to ... To Dr. Poole . You went off your medications . But that 's not ... this ... You know , I ... I saw things . Delusions , you mean . We talked about that . Your brain chemistry , how your illness simulates voices ... all the hallucinations you describe . The devil with yellow eyes . You have something to add ? No . Please keep talking so we can all pretend that our problems are just in our heads . What does that mean ? It means that you 're in here because somebody said you 're not normal . Like normal is this suit we 're all supposed to ... But you know who else wasn 't normal ? Picasso , Einstein . Ooh , I like her . I like you . You got what the kids these days call moxie . You know , just so I 'm clear , are you Einstein or Picasso in this scenario ? Whatever . All I 'm saying is , what if your problems aren 't in your head ? What if they aren 't even problems ? Talk about that . No , I 'm good . I read in your file that you don 't like to be touched . All animals need physical contact to feel love . You know those cartoons in , like , magazines ? There 's a man on an island with , like , maybe a single palm tree . People say , " go to your happy place , " and that 's what I think about . Well , that 's sad . That 's sad ? You 're in a mental hospital . All I 'm saying is ... That thing they tell us is crazy , how I don 't want to be handled , or you see stuff and hear , whatever , voices . That 's what makes you you . Do you want to be my girlfriend ? Okay . But don 't touch me . Okay . Yeah ? Yeah . Okay . Find me at dinner . Why are the hot ones always so crazy ? No cherries . I basically live on cherry pie . It 's incredible . Why ? I don 't like orange-flavored things , and I don 't like cherry-flavored things . I mean , this has , like , pretty much everything you need . It has , like , crust and cherries . I see you . This is your spot ? After the sun goes down , when the light is right , if you ... Kind of unfocus your eyes . Like this , see ? That 's charming . Shut up . Now you . And then look back out . You see how the hospital disappears ? You can see yourself down there . Like you 're in here ... Watching yourself outside . What are you doing ? Keep calm . I 'm not gonna touch you . Just hold still and look out the window . David . How long were you together , you and the girl who disappeared ? She didn 't disappear . I told you , they ... they took her . Sydney Barrett , the girl ? Yes . Look , talk to the hospital . They 've got records . The hospital where you were a patient for the past six years after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia ? Yes , but my condition has nothing to do with that . I didn 't make her up . She 's a real girl ... a woman . Call the hospital . They 've got records . We 've spoken to the hospital , David . They have no record of Sydney Barrett ever being a patient there . Okay . Is it possible , Mr. Haller ... and I 'm not a psychiatrist , so ... but is it possible that this whole thing ... the girl , the incident ... that it 's just part of your illness , a delusion ? Yes , sure , fine . Then ... Well , how do you explain what happened to Lenny ? Or all of them ? Well , I can 't . That 's why we 're having this ... talk to Dr. Kissinger . He knows . And Dr. Kissinger was your psychiatrist ? Yes . Somehow I have a hard time believing your psychiatrist is gonna confirm the story that you 're telling me now . Well , David , I think , don 't you , that we should talk about it ? No . It 's important you ... if you want to go home ... see , my job , part of my job , is to assess . Are you still a danger to yourself , to others ? And the fact that you tried to hang yourself ... we can skip that part . Unless you think it 's relevant to ... no . I mean , we don 't have to . Just ... Interesting . Okay . Let 's talk about it . Well , I had a hard time after college . After I got expelled . I wasn 't thinking straight . The ... the voices and not sleeping and I was angry all the ... David . And then ... Are you okay ? Philly left . And I decided , you know , what was the point ? You know , when a plate breaks , you don 't fix it . You just get another plate . So I tied a knot . No . I 'm telling you , don 't touch it . - Don 't . - You 're stupid . Weak ! Did the voices tell you to do that ? No , no . No , they tried to stop me . They didn 't like it . And yet the police say they found no noose in the apartment . Just rope burns on your neck . How do you feel now ? Better . Well , let me ask you this . Do you still feel that , quote , " you have power over things and can control things with your mind " ? Hold on . You think you can control things with your mind ? I did , at one point , but they helped with that , the drugs and ... is that why I 'm here ? Is that what this is ? David ... I ... you think I did this , that I killed her with my mind ? No , don 't be ridiculous , but the girl is dead , David . She is . And it wasn 't a heart attack , right ? So we 're just ... Looking for the truth . Which you promised to tell . Look , I don 't know , okay ? It 's ... it 's fuzzy . It 's ... That 's okay . Just tell me what happened next . Boo . Jesus . What are you doing ? Shh ... Can you be in here ? Don 't be a pussy . Lie back . No , I 'll be on top . All right . Yeah . I 'm getting out tomorrow . What ? Kissinger says I 'm clean . So I get to go home . Good . That 's good . You got to get better , okay ? So you can come home too . And why couldn 't you touch her ? Well , she was ... you know , it 's a ... it 's a mental hospital . People have issues . I mean , that 's what I thought then . Now ... and how long were you together before the incident ? Can we ... can we take a break ? Please , I just ... without the meds , it 's really hard to keep things straight . Of course , and there 's food coming , I promise , but let 's take a break . We 'll pick this up again in 30 minutes . And cue the phone . Yeah ... Second floor in the ... Is very , very good . It 's a real surprise . How 's it look ? He 's twitchy . You said he was off his meds ? Yeah , for a week now . You think that may be why the sudden spike in telepathic activity ? So is he crazy or ... Well , I think he 's telling the truth as he knows it . Meaning ? Well , he believes he 's mentally ill , but at the same time part of him knows that the power is real . And are we clear on the scope and nature of this power ? No , but if the readings are right , he may be the most powerful mutant that we have ever encountered . After what happened in red hook , I 'd say that 's an understatement . So he has the power , but he doesn 't understand it or know how to control it . I 'd like to dig deeper , see if we can figure out what triggers it . Division one thinks we should kill him now , before he realizes what he is . We may never get the chance again . That would be a mistake . We 've never had a subject like this before . I need ... Look , just give me till the end of the day , and you have the gas if you need it . Okay , but if he so much as farts too loud , we 're moving to level two . Could I be alone ? Is that what you 're gonna do ? Leave me alone ! Look at me . I don 't want to talk about it , okay ? God ! What are you doing ? Did we eat ? What ? Right over there . Yes , sir . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . What ... what 's that for ? It 's just a few tests . They 're readings , really . We want to see what happens in your brain when you feel things . What things ? Stop . Look , just ... I want a lawyer , okay ? I was willing to cooperate before , but now I 'm tired . I 'm just so ... just ... David , I need you to stay calm . You 're afraid of me . David , please . I 'm afraid for you . You 're a very sick young man who stopped taking his medication . Are you a danger to yourself or to others ? I think that 's what we 're here to ascertain . Okay ? Good . Now let 's talk about the incident at clockworks . You can send him a note . It 's probably better anyway . Alvarez , four pills . Don 't forget , you 've got an appointment with Dr. Schubert on Thursday . Hey , where is he ? Who , the kid ? He 's , climbing a mountain . He 's got his ... got his clampons on . Hey , would you ... hold on . It 's lady stuff . They 've got this candy bar . It 's new . I saw it on TV , with nougat and chocolate and , like , this crispy wafer . If you could ... if you could buy one and , like , mail it to me , that 'd be great . I was looking for you . David , no . No . Come on , David . Go ! That 's great , David . Keep pedaling . That 's great , David . Keep pedaling . You went off your medication . You were nervous . Want to be my girlfriend ? David , calm down . Why are the hot ones always so crazy ? David , calm down . Crazy ... David . Sydney . Syd . You 're okay . No ! Hey , be cool , man . Come on . No ! No ! No ! No , don 't ! No , no , no , no ! Get him out of here . David , hold still . No , don 't ! Stop ! Stop ! Back off , David , now . Stop ! No ! No ! No , don 't , stop ! Stop ! No ! No ! No ! No , don 't , stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Stay out of the way . Stop ! No ! Quiet ! Attention , all floors , all stations , we are on mandatory lockdown . Are you okay ? Did you hit your head ? No , I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . Just a little dizzy . No ! No ! No ! No ! Okay , be cool . Come on . Ease up , brother . Please , no ! Please ! He 's in the yellow . Don 't hurt the guy . Don 't ! Stop ! No ! Come on , man . Everybody , there 's nothing to see here . Everybody take a dose . Hey , man , you 've got to cool your body . Just ... What happened ? What is it ? What happened ? No , it feels ... Wrong . No , keep still . I think you may be showing some ... stay here . Wait . Stop . Would you say that again ? I said I looked in the mirror and I was her . Who ? Sydney . She was there with you ? No , she ... Somehow we ... She took my place , and I took hers when we kissed , I guess , but it wasn 't me . I didn 't ... it was ... it was her power , I think . I mean , I guess that 's why she didn 't want ... look , I know , okay ? But you asked . Look , forget it . I-i don 't need this . Look , I have been more than ... But now I really want to get out of here . Calm . Be calm . Nobody is ... I just want to make sure I 've got it right . You were her . She was you . Continue . Attention , all floors , all stations , we are on mandatory lockdown . Help ! Help ! Please ! Please ! Help ! Hello ! No ! Where are the doors ? Let me out of here ! Can anyone help ? Help us ! David ! David , help ! David ! David ! David ! Wait . You said " her power . " Are you saying the girl has some kind of , what , extrasensory powers ? Look , I-i don 't know , but that 's the only ... because it wasn 't me . I mean , at least I didn 't think ... I ... it didn 't feel like before , the other times ... I mean , not that I ... I know , but , David , Lenny is dead . Somehow she ended up inside of a solid wall . So I 'm just trying to ... um , you 're saying the girl ... that you kissed the girl and she switched places with you ? No , you don 't understand . She 's still in there . The kind of questions that are gonna get asked , you may lose your shot at a discharge . Now , you be careful out there . Please , wait . I 'm not Sydney . Don 't forget to fill your prescriptions . Wait . Wait what ? You were there . I was there ? Yes . You were the man in the car at the hospital . Okay , so I 'm clear , you 're saying after you entered the body of a woman and escaped from a mental hospital where all the patients had magically been sealed inside of their rooms , you think you saw me getting out of a car ? Well , you don 't have to be a dick about it , and , yes , it was you . Hey , no , you 're wrong . In fact , that is one of the things that we ... that I need to know . Who were the people at the hospital that day ? No . No , no , no , no . You 're ... you 're lying . You 're trying to confuse me , and ... no . David . David . No . David ! David . Just take a deep breath . Try to be calm . Just try to relax , David . The gas , now . Use the gas . Use the gas ! David , my boy . My beautiful boy . Mommy loves you . She does . My boy . David ? David , where are you ? Trick or treat . It 's gonna be so exciting . Careful . Okay . You can go ahead . Yeah . All right , happy Halloween ! What are you supposed to be ? Trick or treat . Hi . Hi . They sent me home , and then I realized ... I mean , the apartment 's gone . So ... Just for a few days ? Of course . I 'll talk to Ben . Come in . Come in . Avast . I 've got snap jacks and red crusties . Har ! Har ... Holy shit . Ben , you remember my brother , David . Yeah . You guys have any waffles ? Yeah . Yeah . Wow . You weren 't kidding . Another one ? There you go . Is this ... Will this be okay ? Yeah . No , this is ... This is great . So you know , Ben works early , and I 'll probably be gone when you wake up . So ... You know , make yourself at home . Don 't answer the phone . Okay . It 's good . This is gonna be good . Yeah . So what 'd it feel like ? Titties . Having titties . Did you ? If that were me , all day , I 'd ... Stop looking at me like that , man . I know . I 'm dead . You killed me , and I got to say , not cool , man . I didn 't . Yeah , you did . Don 't blame her . Don 't blame her . She was just a ... what do you ... passenger riding around in your body . Don 't give a newbie a bazooka and act surprised when she blows shit up . Lenny ... I 'm sorry , man . No , it 's cool . It 's cool . What was I gonna ... spend the rest of my life popping pills from a little cup ? Don 't worry about me . It 's you that 's got problems . They 're coming for you , babe . Who ? They know about the hospital . What you did . I didn 't . What she did when she was you , had your powers . They 're coming , and they 're gonna kill you . No , no , no . Yeah . No . No . No . No . They are . No , this is just my pill . This is not real . It 's ... I told him , don 't cut my meds . I 'm just ... No . David ? Yeah ? Are you okay ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Sorry , I just ... I just ... I broke the ... the lamp . Um ... Um ... Sorry , it 's ... No , it 's , um ... It 's okay .

If you try anything , you 're gonna get 100,000 volts before you take a breath . What is so funny ? I 'm insane , you idiot . This is my delusion . It 's not real . Stop screwing around . Where 's the girl ? What girl ? Don 't be clever , David . We know who you are . We know they came for her at the hospital thinking she was you . No , you took her at the hospital . You were there . No , David . It 's clear now what happened . They came for you but got her by accident , and we 've got you , but we want her too . So just tell me or ... She was gone . I went looking for her . She was gone . Yeah , I 'm ... Looking for a patient . Sydney Barrett . No , I 'm her father . Max . Hold on . What ? Well , how ... take a left . How can you have no ... no record of her ? She was ... Syd Barrett ... I ... well , how ... I visited her . Don 't stop . I said don 't stop . Wait . How did you ... I 've been looking , and no one would tell me ... Syd , I don 't understand . I was you . Did that really ... we kiss ... and , I mean , I know I 'm crazy , but that felt really ... David , hush . I 'm not really here . What do you mean ? Where else would you be ? This is your memory of the day you called the hospital , not the actual day . I 'm inside your memory . But that 's not ... I 've been projected into your memory . I 've been looking , and no one would tell me ... Syd , I don 't understand . I was you . David , stop . I 'm not really here . What do you mean ? Where else would you be ? This is your memory of the day you called the hospital . I 've been projected into your memory . We 're not on the street , not really . We 're in your mind . They can 't track us in here . Who ? How is that ... I don 't have much time . You 're in a government facility . I know . They said they were cops . They 're not cops . I 'll tell you everything soon , but that 's not what we 're gonna do now . You 're in a government facility . What are we ... you 're gonna go for a swim , and I 'm gonna get you out . A swim ? Slowly , so they don 't notice slide out of your chair and into the water , and when you see the lights , don 't come up until you see me . David . There was a Van . Yes , that was us . Who were the other two people , David ? The people who chased you , the ones who came to the hospital ? David , are you with me ? Yes . I 'm here . It wasn 't you at the hospital . Yeah , I told you . It wasn 't you . Slide out of your chair and into the water , slowly . Watch him . He 's making me nervous . Hey , David , I really need you to stay calm and , please , do not make me press this button . Who are you people ? No . I ask the questions . The girl . Where is the girl ? I think you 're about to find out . Open fire ! Code black ! Do it now ! Hi . Hi . David , don 't . All right ? I 'm sorry . You can 't touch my skin . This is Ptonomy , and that 's Kerry . Hey .

 - I don 't claim that our personalities pass on to another existence . I don 't claim anything because I don 't know anything . For that matter , no human being knows . But I do claim that is is possible to construct an apparatus which will be so delicate that if there are personalities in another existence who wish to get in touch with us , this apparatus will , at least , give them a better opportunity . - Hands off the table , please . - Sorry . - April 27 , 2002 . 9 : 17am period . Subject 's name is Greg leeham . - He is 27 years old . - - It 's Craig . Excuse me ? - My name is Craig , not Greg . It 's Craig . With a ' c ' . - Subject Craig leeham is 27 years old period . The subject has consented to participate in accordance with irb guidelines . Mr. leeham , Mr. leeham . - Yes , sir . - Please state for the video record that you understand the nature of this study . - I do . Whoa . - Mr. Leeham , have you removed all credit cards , watches , jewelry , et cetera ? - I 'm sorry , what ? - Metal . Just to confirm , you have no metal rods , pins , plates or artificial parts of any kind . Okay , Mr. leeham , - no . My assistant will now be closing the door effectively sealing you in the room . Do not , under any circumstances , touch that telephone until it rings . Let us know immediately if you feel any nausea . - I 'm sorry , did you say nausea ? - This is Dr. Carl meiselhoff proceeding with human trial number 31 of the Edison spectograph dm field receiver . The subject reports a recent loss of his younger sister , Jennifer leeham period . Transcranial transoptic electromagnetic field dispersers have been placed period . Followed my injection of ketamine , 20 milligrams iv . Infrasound frequency will begin at 19 hertz with two hertz incremental decrease every five seconds period . Mr. leeham . Are you ready to begin ? How we doing , Greg ? - Look , I 'm fine okay . Just let me know when you start . - We 've started . - I hear sirens . I hear knocking . Sounds like knocking . Is someone trying to get into the room ? - No , not yet . Please remain in your seat . If you can describe , as best you can , what you 're experiencing . - I feel I feel like someone 's here . A presence . Professor . Professor , I think i change my mind . - You can go ahead and answer it . - Hello . - Connection secured at eight hertz and 109 decibels period . 67 seconds elapsed . - Hello . No , I can 't hear you but i can hear you breathing . You have to ... Yes . Yes . No , no . No , it was my fault . I was trying to protect you . - Stop it ! Stop it ! - Please stop ! - - Who is this ? - It hurts . - - Who is this ? What is going on ? What the hell is going on here ? Is this some kind of sick joke ? - Hey ! - He 's seizing . - No . Hold on . Six more seconds . - Please rise . We assume death to be the worse thing that could possibly happen to any person . How very wrong this idea is . - Alright , I need help over here . She 's a 33 year old with a gunshot wound to her abdomen . Husband attacked her and the kids . - We 're good . Go ahead . This is marcela Gutierrez . Gunshot wound to the abdomen . No allergies . I gave her two milligrams of versed , 200 of ketamine fully reversed and she 's doing well . Hey marcela . The surgery 's over . You 're just waking up . Esta bien . - She says she saw her babies . They 're in a beautiful place . - Who of us would really want to remain on earth with all its never-ending struggles ? Death is a natural step . - She saw her kids . - Yeah , she was there . Her ex-husband shot ' em both . - No , she thinks she saw them after . - It was probably this . You left it on your cart . - You leaving your narcs on your cart ? - Anyway , ketamine 's known to induce near death experiences . - Really ? - - Oh yeah . We had a guy in faculty , he was injecting it in his grad students for a research study . Irb shut him down . - How do you know this stuff ? - He was my patient . - So , at eight o 'clock ? - Tonight ? - - Yeah . Go ahead and bring your girlfriend . - Okay . - Cool . - See ya tonight . - Yeah . - What are you thinking for dinner tonight ? - Actually , Devin and Donna invited us over to their place tonight . - I don 't know , bray , I 'm not feeling great and ... - They 're colleagues . It 'll be fun , come on , don 't make me go alone . - It 's just that i thought that , you know , we could have our own celebration tonight . - We can celebrate there . - That doesn 't sound right . - No , it 's true . For every 35 pounds he gains , a man loses an inch . Oprah wouldn 't lie . - Well , as long as it 's evidence based science . - Come on , that 's not true , is it ? - Abbey . - Oh , no , I 'm fine , thank you . - Oh , come on , Abbey , drink up . Devin 's on call but what 's your excuse ? Pregnant ? - Oh , congratulations . - No way . - That is so great . - Thanks . - How many weeks ? Six , I think . - Well , I 'd like to propose a toast . To Abbey and Brayden . On the verge of a new life . In more ways than one . - You know , Abbey , I forget , what is it that you do ? - I 'm an artist . - Really , that 's amazing . - Yeah , so I 'm experimenting with mixed media right now . So , gravestone rubbings and watercolors , things like that . - She 's really talented , Francine . She came and taught at my pottery class . - Our lives are gonna change soon . You have to let go of your old life . I promise you , you won 't miss it . - Who of us would really want to remain here on earth with all its never-ending struggles . Death is a natural step . - Brayden , I have to say , I love Abbey . I mean , I think she 's great . - Thanks . - All I 'm saying is , Brayden , you 're a lucky guy . Abbey is every guy 's dream . Seriously , if anything ever happens to you , I 'll take care of Abbey . - Oh yeah , that 's not out of line at all . - It 's okay . I am officially taking her off the market . - No way . - Well , don 't let Donna see this , she 's gonna want me to upgrade . - Too late , she helped me pick it out . - Sweetie , it 's Donna . You okay ? I need help in here . Brayden . - What eye has not seen , what ear has not heard . Neither has it entered into the heart of man . What things god has prepared for them that love him . - Hey . - Hey . Did I wake you ? - So , am I okay ? - Yeah , hun . You 're fine . - Thank god . I was so worried about the baby . Someone 's at the door , babe . - They can wait . - No , get it , i have to pee anyway . - Everything go okay ? - She did great , Brayden . Blood loss looked a lot worse than what it was . Well , listen , you know what I mean , me and Donna we 're just so sorry . - Dev , thanks again . I 'm glad it was you on call . - Is she awake ? - Yeah , she just woke up . She was so excited about the baby . She really wanted it . We both did . - Hello ? - - Abbey , where are you ? - Brayden , what happened ? - Abbey . - I didn 't know what to do , I just want to get home . - I know , sweetie , I know . I am so sorry you found out that way . - No , Brayden , I 'm sorry I lost our baby . - Stop that . Stop that , don 't talk like that . This was not your fault . - I don 't know . - Abbey , listen to me . New rule , no blaming ourselves for things we can 't control . We accept life as it comes . - Okay , I like rules . I love you to death , you know that . - Me , too , I 'm driving around right now looking for you . - You are ? - Yes . Now , where are you ? I 'm taking you home . - Franklin . - Franklin ? Franklin and what ? Abbey ! - Holy shit ! - Abbey , are you okay ? - Holy shit ! - Abbey , I 'm so sorry . - Just unlock the door . Brayden , open the door . - Abbey . - - I 'm freezing my ass off . - It won 't unlock if you 're lifting the handle . Abbey , don 't move . - What ? - Brayden ? - - I 'm here . I 'm here . - I hear sirens . Brayden , get the door . Someone 's knocking . - Abbey , stay awake . Come on , don 't close your eyes , stay awake . Abbey , look at me , look at me , right here . You don 't go anywhere without me . Look . I have something for you . Open your eyes . Brayden , Brayden , Brayden . - Sir , emergency response units are on their way . Sir , I need you to tell me her condition . Is she awake ? Is she breathing ? Hello , sir , can you hear me ? Is anyone there ? I can hear you breathing . - Abbey . - Hey , buddy , it 's Devin . Me and Donna were thinkin maybe , you should come and stay with us for a little while . It 's probably not a good idea for you to be alone right now . - Hi , Abbey . - Hi , Brayden . What are you doing ? - You 're very pretty . - Oh , thank you . You 're very handsome . You 're pretty cute . - I 'm a scientist , I 'm , I 'm ... - Human , there we go . - Yeah , in medical profession , trust me . These hands have put people to sleep and brought them back to life . - That 's so hot . - It 's the button on the side . Just push it forward and back . Eat something . - Babe . - Here , let me hold the camera a second . - What is it ? You better not have , I ... - What ? - Brayden . - Earrings ! - - Earrings . - Yay . - - A whole set . Oh , almost . Oh , no , yeah , it 's perfect , it 's beautiful . Thank you . - Hi , this is Brayden . - And , this is Abbey . We 're not here but if you think about it , who is . - What was that ? - What , I was being existential . - Abbey , just record a normal message . - Hey , buddy , it 's Devin . Take as much time off as you need but I 'm thinking , maybe , if you got back to work it might help you get into , well . Anyway , give me a call when you 're ready . - Hello . - Hey , Bob , it 's me , Brayden . - Brayden , are you okay ? - Yeah , listen . The other day , you said something about a guy on faculty doing research with ketamine . Who was that ? - Oh , oh yeah . Dr. meiselhoff , Dr. Carl meiselhoff . He had this crazy idea about using electromagnetic fields for anesthesia . Wanted me to use it for his radical prostate . - He was a patient ? - Yeah . - Dr. Carl meiselhoff . Meiselhoff ? What department was he in ? Surgery , medicine ? - He 's in , uh , physics . - Physics ? - - Yeah . He has a phd . Listen , Brayden , I 'm here for you . I really am but can we talk about this tomorrow . I got a cranium at 6 : 30 . - Yeah , um , sure , of course . Sorry . Thanks , Bob . - Anytime . I mean it . - I know . - And , this leads us to the ultimate big question . Why do the laws of physics , in our classical world seem to break down at the subatomic or the quantum world . Shouldn 't there be one law that unifies everything ? Shouldn 't there be a theory of Everything . Well , it seems that the answer may lie in incredibly small particles of vibrating energy that we call superstrings . Or string theory . When you vibrate a superstring , the vibrations produce unique subatomic particles like an electron . In a sense , the universe that we know is the result of a symphony being played at the subatomic level by vibrating superstrings . Are you with me so far ? - Hi , welcome back to true science . I 'm your host Sean fox and today we 're here with one of the country 's leading physicist , Dr. Carl meiselhoff . Dr. meiselhoff , you 've long been regarded as something of a rebel in the field of particle physics and other dimensions . - I 'm not a rebel , i am doing the work of a long legacy of rebels but I 'm not a rebel . - Well , the physics community has long relied on large expensive particle colliders to study such things as fusion and string theory . You claim to have found a different path . - Well , it 's very complex , Sean . But , the fundamentals of our work suggest that at the moment of death , the human brain can perceive the subatomic realm or quantum universe , if you will . - So , are you saying your subjects are people or ghosts ? - Are you saying there 's a difference ? If someone communicates or travels from one membrane to another , that which makes it human remains intact . Anybody that 's familiar with niels bohr would know that . - Of course . - We found that by using a combination of stimuli , we can mimic the moment of death in the human brain . We actually are tricking the brain into thinking it 's dying . - Define stimuli . - Low frequency sound waves , medicinal agents . That sort of thing . - Really , what sort of medicinal agents are we talking about here ? - Well , we 've tried several but we found the most success with ketamine . - May I help you ? - Oh , I 'm looking for Dr. Carl meiselhoff . Is he home ? - I 'm sorry , he 's not . I 'm his wife , Margaret . - Nice to meet you , Margaret . My name is Brayden Taylor . I was just hoping to speak with your husband about his work . - I 'm sorry that 's not possible . - I don 't need much time . I just have a few . - Dr. meiselhoff is no longer with us . - Oh . Oh , I 'm , I 'm so sorry . - Yeah . Thank you . - I just recently went through a similar loss myself . My fiance , I lost her last week . - Well , I 'm sorry . You 're far too young to know that kind of pain . - With all due respect , ma 'am , I don 't think anyone 's old enough to know that pain . - Would you care for a cup of coffee ? Now , tell me , what do you do ? - I 'm an anesthetist . - Good for you . I don 't believe in god either . - What ? No , anesthetist . Anesthesia . I 've been doing some research on the use of electromagnet . - You 're not the first person to come around . And , you didn 't come here to find out how to put people to sleep . My guess is that there 's someone you 're looking to wake up . No ? - Thomas Edison gave an interview with scientific American magazine . He stated that he 's working on a device that would allow those that have died to communicate with those that are living . Apparently , he actually built a prototype and generations of scientists , including your husband , have worked on it . - I see . - I thought he might know where the device is . - The only way you 're gonna have a conversation with the dead is if you join them . - Perhaps . - Let me ask you this . If you found it , what would you do with that device ? It wouldn 't help you find someone you 've lost , you 'd only lose yourself . Is that a price you 're willing to pay ? - So , it does exist . - You 're not answering my question . - I would pay any price for Abbey . I would do anything to have her back . - Choose your words carefully , young man . You know , I have some clutter in my garage . Maybe you can help me move some boxes . - Don 't act like you can 't hear me , I know you can . - Hello . - If you can help me find him . Perhaps , I can help you . - You pile of junk , come on . - Alright , you idiot . Got ya . It 's very beautiful over there . Did you see him ? - Who the hell are you ? - Luis , Dr. Luis mastenbrook . Our fields connected . Thank you for the coffee . - What do you want ? - Do you have a little splenda ? - No , I mean , what do you want with me and all this ? - Nothing , I 'm just following instructions . So , no on the splenda ? - Instructions ? From whom ? - Carl meiselhoff . - Meiselhoff is dead . - Yes , I know , suicide . Oh . You didn 't know that . Carbon monoxide poisoning . Fired up the Lexus , closed the garage door . - He was a friend of yours ? - He was my mentor . And , yes , he was a friend . - You 're a physicist . - Among other things , Carl and I were part of a scientific think tank of sorts . - The god model project . You work for the government . - No . It 's international . It 's a coalition of the world 's top physicist . The goal is to define the rules of the known universe before the end of the century . - So , you 're , like , scary smart . - Mostly just smart . And , what is it that you do ? - Anesthesia . Meiselhoff 's widow gave me the equipment . - You know you 're one of a handful of people who 's ever actually seen the Edison spectographic em field . - Where did you hear that ? - Where did I hear what ? - It 's very beautiful over there . Where 'd you hear that . - Those were his last words . - Whose ? - Thomas Edison . - Most of this stuff is pretty outdated . I 'm thinking if we replace some of it . - No . Replace one component , the whole thing can fail . It all works , we 're just not exactly sure why . You can add to the chain but you can 't change the links . I tried reproducing this on my own but without success . For instance , this phone is mostly copper wiring . All the guts been replaced with non-ferrous metals . - It 's not magnetic . - Right . And , it doesn 't interfere with the high mf 's of the helmet . - Those electric dreadlocks almost gave me a seizure . - Psychoacoustics . Infrasound . Sound waves generated at very low frequencies . Below what most people can hear . You know , nothing is calibrated here . You could 've killed yourself . At low frequencies , infrasonic admitters really mess with the body . The Russians tried to use it as a weapon . It literally scares the shit out of you . Rapid pulse , gagging , vomiting . Bowl spasms . Uncontrolled defecation . Vibrating visual field . - Vibrating visual field ? - Yeah , the eye vibrates so severely that the intraocular pressure raises to the point of rupture . - I heard voices . They were hard to make out . - Did you see anything ? - I 'm not sure . - Yup . I 'm hungry , too . - Hey , get you boys anything to eat ? - Maybe , later . Can we get a basket of bread for now ? - Sure . - What a sweetie . - Luis , what is going on here ? What do physics and superstrings have to do with the afterlife ? - Excuse me , can we get more jam , please ? I 'm oddly attracted to her . String theory , right . String theory , what do you know about it , Brayden ? - Not much . Universe is made up of tiny vibrating strings . Theory of everything . - Right . A unified theory of everything . It 's the holy grail of physics . It makes sense mathematically but we don 't know any of it . This is science that is , literally , pushing the envelope . - It sounds more like philosophy . - They don 't give out nobel prizes for philosophy . - Are you implying you 've devised an experiment that will prove the existence of superstrings ? - No . Thomas Edison did . Tesla did . So William crook , j . Gilbert Wright , William o 'Neil . They all did . Every person that has worked on this since the 1920 's , did . But , no one made the connection until meiselhoff . - Connection to what ? - M-theory . - ' M ' for meiselhoff . - ' M ' for membrane . Some people , myself included , think that this is where we live . On a membrane in a larger dimensional space . Now , this jam is us . We Are stuck on this membrane . Nothing gets off the membrane , except for one thing . - What ? - - Gravity . Or , more precisely , gravitons . - I see and where do these gravitons go ? - To another membrane . - There 's more than one ? - Most likely infinite membranes . All parallel to our own and all with their own universe . - You boys doing okay ? - Actually , I ... - We 're fine . - Thanks . - Our personalities , the essence of who we are is an electromagnetic field created by our brain . Meiselhoff made the connection between electromagnetic fields and gravity . To put it simply . When we die , everything that we are , our soul , hitches a ride on gravity to another membrane . At least , that 's what meiselhoff thinks . Thought . But , he didn 't have the expertise to prove it . - This one 's not working . - Don 't bother . The magnetic coils on the helmet erased every one of them in your wallet . - Luis , can you really do this ? Can you really find someone after they 're . - I 've been working on something that will allow us to navigate the quantum realm . Not only can I find somebody , i can bring them back . But , I need you to get one more person . This person will act as a conduit that will allow my equipment to make contact with the membrane . - We don 't need anybody else . I can handle it . - Trust me , you can 't handle half of what this guy can . - What guy ? - From the best church of god radio network , this is break on through to the lord . Join us for the next hour as medium Craig leeham shows us firsthand , the rewards awaiting those who live a Christian life . Hi , I 'm pastor Dave . If you 're a returning listener , welcome back . If you 're new to the program , well then , you are in for something special . As always , I 'm here with Craig leeham . For the past two years , Craig 's been revealing to us , not only how much god loves us in this life , but in the next as well . How are you tonight , Craig ? - I 'm fine , pastor Dave , just fine . I 'm looking forward to helping some of those of you out there who , although , you 've accepted Christ into your lives , having a little trouble feeling god 's love due to the loss of a loved one . - As you may suspect , Craig 's been blessed with a special gift . A tragic accident robbed him of his sight in this life but the lord has allowed him to see into the next . Ladies and gentlemen , Craig leeham doesn 't merely talk to the dearly departed , he sees them . Craig , I think we all want to know . What does heaven look like ? - Well , pastor Dave , it 's , uh , it 's very beautiful over there . - Amen . Amen . Okay , let 's get started . We have our first caller already . It 's a Judith lamulfa from Colorado Springs . Are you there Judith ? - Hi , pastor Dave , how are you ? - I 'm great , thanks to Jesus . - Hi Craig . - Hi , Judith , how can we help you tonight ? - Well , my husband passed away six months ago . - I 'm so sorry , Judith . - Thank you , Craig . It was an accident . - Oh , that 's okay , Judith , take your time . - We never got to say our goodbyes . That bastard drunk driver . - Okay , Judith , I can tell that this is a very emotional issue for you . If you can , I 'd like you to try to let go of your anger for right now and think about how much you miss and love your husband . What was his name ? - Gordon . He had black hair and these big ole ears . - That 's enough . I don 't want you to tell me anymore . All I need is his name . Hello , Gordon . - Hello . - Judith , what is it you 'd like to say ? Judith is calling out to you . - Gordon , i miss you so much . - Judith . I didn 't mean to do this . I tried to tell them . - He didn 't mean to leave , he tried to tell them . - I 'm sorry but don 't you hand me that crap . Maybe , if you wouldn 't have been driving with your buddy , Jack Daniels , I 'd still have a husband . - Oh , Judith . I know you 're just mad 'cause you love me . I love you , too . - I love you , too . He 's holding something out . It 's something for you . - Tell him he can keep it . Right up his ass . - Soon Judith . We will again soon . - It 's a seashell . He says soon , you will again soon . - He picked that up off the beach for me on our first date . We met in Santa Barbara . I buried that shell with him . Oh . Gordon . - He 's leaving us . - Gordon . - - Goodbye . Please . Please don 't go . - Thank you , Craig . Praise the lord . Thank you so much , Judith , for calling . - God bless you both . - Thank you , Judith . - Alright , folks , we 're going to take a little break while our sponsor tells you how to keep your financial future safe with gold coins . - Shows over , I don 't do private sessions . - I 'm not here for a session . - Then take your piss and get out . - I 'm here to ask for your help with a research study I 'm involved in . - Look , I have a car waiting for me , okay . I need to . - Look , my name is Brayden Taylor . We 're continuing Dr. Meiselhoff 's work and . - Meiselhoff ? - Yes . - You tell that rat bastard that I won 't see him again until he 's dead and rotting in hell . - Carl meiselhoff is dead . He killed himself three months ago . We have the equipment , all of it . - What do you mean , we ? - Myself and Luis mastenbrook . - Mastenbrook . So , why are you so interested in meiselhoff 's work ? You got a sudden urge to shit your pants and turn your eyeballs inside out ? - Well , I guess you could say my story 's a lot like that woman you spoke with except , I don 't believe in psychics . - What do you know about Luis ? - Not much . He sorta showed up and offered his services . - You let a total stranger into your house ? - He seems smart . But , a little short on social skills . I know he 's a physicist . - He 's not just a physicist . He 's the physicist . Guy can 't leave the country without a special passport in case he 's kidnapped and tortured . He was at the top of his game until he dropped off the face of the earth . - What happened ? - Nobody knows . But , apparently , you found him . Come to think of it . Sounds more like he found you . - Yeah . You know , I 'm starting to get a little creeped out by that . Luis , this is Craig leeham . - It 's been a long time , Greg . - Craig . - It 's good to see you again . - Well , I wish I could say the same , Luis . - It appears I 've put you in an uncomfortable position , Brayden . I 'm partly responsible for Mr. Leeham 's current condition . - I was a grad student and Luis offered to help me with my thesis if I participated in a little research with Dr. Carl meiselhoff . - It appears you 've gained other gifts . - Well , then what do you say we poke out your eyes and see what gifts you inherit . - I understand your bitterness . Apparently , you 've chosen to accept my invitation in spite of that . - He makes a good point , Craig . - Where is this thing ? - Would you like to see it ? You 'd be happy to know , Greg , that I 've added some new components that greatly improve its accuracy . - Yeah . Well , you could add all the technology you want to this thing , Luis , it 's still just an electric ouja board . - No , there 's nothing supernatural . It follows the laws of nature . Rules that we almost completely understand . - For fools rush in where angels fear to tread . - Excuse me ? - You 'll never understand all the rules , Luis . The god model won 't allow it . - What 's he talking about , Luis ? - I understand more than you think . - No , no , you think you understand more than you think . I need to grow a tail , where 's the can ? - Come on , I 'll show you . - Can you believe that guy ? - He 's blind , dude . - Brayden , I know what I 'm doing . - I haven 't seen you do anything yet . Luis , what is the god model ? - It 's irrelevant . - Not according to Craig . - Albert Einstein came up with it about 60 years ago . He was giving a lecture at Princeton . One of his students asked , do you believe in god . Einstein drew a square on the board . The square represents all the knowledge of how the universe works . He then drew another square inside it like this . This square represents everything we 've learned so far . Einstein divided the inner square into four sections . Now , everything on the left side consists of things that move slower than half the speed of light and everything on the right side , faster than half the speed of light . The top half contains everything larger than an atom . You , me , planets , galaxies , et cetera . The bottom half , obviously , contains things smaller than an atom . Protons , neutrons , electrons . - Strings . - - Exactly . Einstein then explained that each of these boxes represented a different area of physics . Classical . Relativity . Quantum . And , relativity quantum . Each time we make a new discovery , we push this inner box a little closer to the edge of the outer box . For example , m-theory , if correct , would put us here . - How long until the box is filled in ? - Oddly enough , one of his students asked that question as well . Einstein answered never . - Why not ? - Because then we 'd know everything . Because then we 'd be god . - So , then where does our little experiment fit into this diagram ? - That 's why the god model 's irrelevant . - You need to know . Luis plans to subject you to that device again . How do you feel about that ? - I 've already lost my eyes and control of my bowels . So , what else do I have to lose ? - Your life . - Life is never lost , Brayden . It 's relocated . That 's why I 'm here . - You 're looking to relocate ? - No . I 'm looking to locate . I , uh , I was young . And , stupid and my father left us really early on so I felt like I had to be the man of the house . You know . So , uh . I bought a gun . For protection , you know , and because it made me feel like a badass . The day I brought it home , my sister found it . And , you know , my mother never really forgave me . You know what i mean , how do you . - You know , it 's okay . You can cry if you wanna . - No . I can 't . - Uh oh . Can you give me one of those masks ? - Is that chloroform ? - Yes , it is . Whew . I feel woozy . - What is that , Luis ? - It 's my contribution . It 's a computer . Quantum , quantum topographical . - So , this is better than a regular computer ? - It can calculate in one hour what you 're computer would take 300 years . Yeah , it 's a little bit better . It can decipher any code in the world . And , with Craig 's help , it 's gonna allow us to contact Abbey . There 's gonna be no noise , no interference . It 's gonna isolate her electromagnetic pattern on the membrane . - What are you saying ? - He 's saying , he wants to trace the call . - Our personalities survive after we die . And , the gravitons that carry them off leave a trail . Meiselhoff knew this . - A map to the afterlife ? A map to heaven . - Or hell . - Look , you 're gonna be able to talk to Abbey . And , you 're not gonna have to suffer the adverse effects of the equipment . - You 're welcome . We 'll see . - We 're gonna have to go to the hospital . We don 't have anymore ketamine . - Forget the drugs . I brought my own . Buckle up . - You ready in there , champ ? You know what you 're doing , right ? I mean , this isn 't dangerous ? - Oh no , this is very dangerous . Okay , Craig , it 's starting . - How you feeling , Craig ? - Awesome . - He 's drinking . - Isn 't that okay ? Can he do that ? How we doing in there , Craig ? Craig ? - Hello . Hello . - Hello . - Hello . - Hello . I can hear you breathing , breathing , breathing , breathing . - Abbey . - Brayden ? - Abbey , are you there ? - Why 'd you bring me here ? - Abbey bring you where ? Bring you where . Abbey . - Keep her talking . I almost got it . - Why did you bring me here ? - Wait , Abbey , wait . Abbey . - I love you . - Abbey , where are you ? - I love you . - I love you , too . - Abbey , I 'm so ... - - Brayden . I 'm so sorry . - Wait , Abbey . - Brayden . Brayden . Craig . - He 's seizing . - Snow . - What ? - It was snowing , wasn 't it ? - I don 't understand . - When she died . - Why did you say ... - It was snowing , wasn 't it ? - Where is she ? Where do we go when we die ? - They 're all around us . Their universe . Our universe . The membranes both occupy the same space . - What ? - We can 't travel there because there 's nowhere to travel to . We don 't go anywhere . - What happened , Luis ? - It was too much . In order to get any data , i had to crank everything up and he couldn 't take it . Apparently , to make this thing work , you have to induce seizures and fry a person 's brain . Ultimately , making it a one way trip . - What if we shut the brain down ? - How so ? - You use ketamine before to mimic a near death state . What if we went further ? What if we induced a general anesthetic , enough to suppress the seizure stage . Then let the subject emerge from anesthesia once contact is made . - It 's plausible , I suppose . Increase the seizure threshold would allow Craig to - tolerate ... - - Not Craig . - What you 're suggesting means that we need another person . One who 's qualified to administer anesthesia . - Abbey , are you there ? I can 't hear you . - Why 'd you bring me here . - Abbey , bring you where ? Bring you where ? Abbey . We were this close . I spoke to her . I heard her voice . - Brayden , this is somebody 's voice . My guess is they got some girl sitting on a cellphone outside your house . That 's your proof ? Voicemail from heaven and a bucket of melted wax ? That is not evidence based science . I blame myself . I mean , I should 've been keeping a lot closer an eye on you after you ... - Look , I was depressed after Abbey died . I admit that but i wasn 't irrational . - You weren 't irrational ? You let two total strangers with suspect credentials convince you that they can defy the laws of physics . That they can contact the afterlife . They 're living in your house . You don 't even know who they are . - I know enough . What 's this ? - Evidence . See , after I found out you were investigating Carl meiselhoff , I did a little investigating of my own . Turns out your genius buddy killed the last guy that he worked with . - If that 's true , why isn 't he in prison ? - They never found a body . - Any coffee left boys ? Hospital ? - Yeah . - Taking a lot of call lately ? - Don 't worry about it . - Dev , I 'll be back at work soon , I promise . - Brayden , I 'll cover your hours , you know that . But , I do think it would be a good idea for you to go back to work . Focus on the real world for a change . - Good to see you , Donna . - And , don 't be a stranger . How 's he doing ? - He 's a mess . - So , what 's the mold of ? - Mold ? - Yeah , it 's like one of the molds from my pottery class . So what is it ? - Bye . - Love you . - Anesthesia , we 're not supposed to be using cellphones in the or . - Yeah , usually it doesn 't take three hours to do a lap chole either but here we are . Hey , honey . - Dev . There 's something here you need to see . - Meiselhoff didn 't commit suicide , you killed him . You killed him with this . - It wasn 't suicide . And , it certainly wasn 't homicide . - You are lying . - He isn 't lying . Carl meiselhoff isn 't dead . - So , he 's alive . - No . - Brayden , listen to me . Meiselhoff wanted to make things right . Redemption for what he did to Craig and his sister . She 's stuck . Inbetween membranes that we created . - What I need is for you to stop with all this metaphysical horseshit and just leave . - We lost him . I lost him . - You know what . When we lose someone in the or , it 's usually because ... - You don 't understand , Brayden , I lost him . He 's not here . He 's somewhere else . - Somebody gonna get that ? - There 's one thing i wanna make clear right now . Guess who the bitch is gonna be if we wind up in the same prison cell . It 's Abbey 's , isn 't it ? - How is this possible ? - Sometimes the departed give me things . Physical objects that help those they left behind find their way . - Bore . - Oh , I 'm sorry , am I boring you ? Because , by all means , go right back to packing . - Not bore , bohr . B-o-h-r . He 's the founder of quantum physics . He found that when you observe a subatomic particle , say an electron , it actually changes its position and velocity . And , this is relevant because when we observe the subatomic world , there are no rules . An object can exist in two places at once . - Like the seashell . - And , the ring . - Exactly . Abbey 's final memory was snowfall and she brought that memory to her afterlife . This membrane that we go to when we die , it 's in a state of quantum entanglement . Until we arrive with all our perceptions and our prejudices , ultimately , defining that world . - Heaven exists ? - Heaven , nirvana , hell , it all exists . Not because the Bible or the quran or Buddha says it does . It exists because we expect it to . - You know , I don 't think there 's a dress code for the afterlife . - Then why do they bury everyone in suits ? - Alright , it 's gonna hurt like a son of a bitch . I promise you 're not gonna end up like Craig . - You sure about this , Devin ? - You 're asking me now ? - Listen , if things don 't go well , I don 't want you to feel you know . - Nobody 's gonna die . Hey , he 's not gonna die right ? - No . - What 's this ? - Glaucoma drug , timoptic . I 'm also gonna give you an anticholinergic so you don 't shit your pants . - Good idea man . - The hell is this ? - Somebody 's not right . Luis , shut it down , it 's too much . - I know what I 'm doing . - You 're gonna lose him . - No . Hold on . - - Shut it down . Six more seconds . - They 're all around us . - Where the hell did he go ? - Welcome home , Carl . - Devin . Luis . Guys , it didn 't work . - Only one at a time . Where 's the dog ? - Jennifer ? - Jenny , nobody calls me Jennifer . - Where 's Brayden ? - He 's here . And , there . - What the hell do you mean by that ? - It means they flipped membranes . - Flip him back . - You can 't just flip membranes . Only one person can go across at a time . It would mean one of us would have to exchange to get Brayden back . - Yeah , well , I nominate you . - No . We need him . - I was following instructions . - Listen , my boy 's over there , bring him back . Just bring him back . - It was a necessary evil . Without Carl , we 're lost . - Figure it out . - It 's impossible . - No . There 's a way it can be done . Isn 't that right , Craig . - Can I have this ? - It belongs to a friend of mine . - Abigail . - Yes , Abbey . - You lost her . - Yes , I lost her . It was my fault . - My fault , that 's what he said . - Who ? - Craig . - Start talking . - Okay , um . Let 's say that each of my palms are membranes . And , we have one person over here . And , we have another over here . Now , what Luis is talking about is an extraction . That is where membranes come in contact , sort of a snatch and grab job . As you can see , it doesn 't really work that well . Both parties cease to exist . In fact , we all cease to exist . - The universe will cease to exist . - Now , what if instead of connecting them , we simply merge them . To occupy the same space for a short period of time and then separate them . - And , just who 's gonna merge these two worlds ? - You got anymore of that ketamine shit ? - I just want the ring . - I have another ring . Right here . - You can 't come out . Not until it starts . There 's a balance . - Luis . Luis . - Yeah , Craig . - Thank you . - Brayden . - Craig . Where 's Abbey ? - Better hang on . Here it comes . - It exists because we expect it to . - Abbey , it 's me . It 's Brayden . I need an answer . - We assume death to be the worse thing that could possibly happen to any person . How very wrong this idea is . Death is a natural step . - Brayden , Brayden , Brayden . - Come with me , I 'm taking you home . - Help guide me . - Need help , Jenny . - Brayden . There 's a balance . - Hey . Hallelujah . - Oh no . I 'm losing them . I 'm losing them . - What is it ? - Infinite membranes . All parallel to our own . And , each with their own universe . - Hold on . - - Brayden . - Jenny . It 's time to go . - It was always about bringing someone back . I never intended to send anyone over there . - Over where ? Dr. mastenbrook . Dr. mastenbrook . - I 'm sorry . - You were saying that you sent them over . Over where ? - Over there . Each to another universe . - Well , correct me if I 'm wrong but it sounds like you 're talking about m-theory . - It 's not a theory , it 's a law . - So , you 're claiming that membranes exist . How could you possibly know this ? - Because I 've seen them . And , they are beautiful .

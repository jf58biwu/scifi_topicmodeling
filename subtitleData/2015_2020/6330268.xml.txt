 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... A team centered around people with powers ? Daisy : There exists a small percentage of the population with a dormant alien gene . There 's a chemical compound that activates this gene . And you , Joey , are one of the first people to come into contact with it . No leadership means nobody giving orders , and that sure as hell includes you . - Aah ! - I 'm done flying solo . I miss having a team around me . Coulson : I miss her , too . I 'm having a hard time accepting it ... all of it . I-I 'm on my third hand . May took off on vacation and never came back , so I lost my right hand , too . We need to say goodbye . Jemma would want us to do that . [ Screams ] Do someth-i-i-i-ing ! 3x02 - Purpose in the Machine _ May our gifts see you through the journey . Perhaps it w ... What if I fail to fail return ? Be brave , my lord . [ Monolith warbling ] [ Growling ] [ Manzini screams ] Will he come back ? Our best minds are working to understand this . But as far as we know , in all of history ... no one has ever returned . Daisy : I think Joey 's a real candidate . [ Scoffs ] Sure . He 's Inhuman . But ... doesn 't meet my criteria . He 's a decent guy , and you know it . Getting that unit up and running is priority . Yeah , but it doesn 't mean it has to be a rush job . Look , Dr. Garner will make his recommendation . And it will be the same as always ... three months observation and counseling before reassessment . He 's as much of a buzzkill as you are . [ Chuckles ] And if you haven 't been keeping score , our team 's down to three musketeers . May and Simmons are gone . Fitz might as well be , Bobbi 's on the DL . And from what I hear , Hunter 's planning to leave . Yeah , but not for good . He 's got a score to settle . - It 's Fitz ! - Fitz broke into containment ! [ Screaming ] - Fitz ! - Fitz , get out of there ! - Are you crazy ? - Close it ! Close it ! I got it ! [ All gasping ] [ Click ] Damn it , Fitz . I had to know ... had to ... - Had to know ... - I already lost Simmons to that thing . I cannot afford to lose you , too . - Trying to get yourself killed ? - Sorry . [ Sighs ] I won 't give up . I can 't give up . None of us want to , Fitz , but ... Fitz , you tried . Okay ? You tried your hardest . Everybody knows that . No . I missed something . I m ... I missed something . [ Breathing heavily ] - What is that ? - Proof . Sand . Not just sand ... impossible sand . The Monolith 's case is a clean room . There 's nothing in there but that rock . Not even dust . Unless you blast it open with a shotgun - and contaminate everything . - That 's not what this is . Okay , the sand itself ... not unusual . Mostly silicone-dioxide particles just like on Earth . But you 're saying this sand is not from Earth ? - Sir , carbon dating shows that ... - It predates the Earth by a billion years . So you think the rock is a portal ? No . No , I 'm proving that it 's a portal , okay , to another planet , a-a very old planet ... a crack in space-time that carried Simmons away ... and carried the sand back . Which means ... She 's out there . - But it 's been months . - Yeah ? She could be long gone from wherever this thing dropped her . Yeah . - She could be dead . - Yes . - But we 're gonna find out , aren 't we ? - Yeah . - You 're damn right . - Yeah . Okay , Fitz , what do you need ? Uh , uh , well , uh , more historical data . People have studied this thing for centuries . I need an expert on quantum mechanics and Einstein-Rosen bridge theory , and a ... a sandwich would be nice . I might have an idea ... about the other things . You two , stay with our new Inhuman guest . Be here for Dr. Garner 's assessment . Building that team is still the priority . - What did I say ? - Bobbi ... I 'm on this with Fitz . Yeah , haven 't you been on this with Fitz the whole time ? Hiding his trip to Morocco , covering for him on a constant basis ? Have I ? [ chuckles ] And you know where you 're going . Coulson would be pissed if he knew what you had planned . Part of our agreement . He won 't sweat the details , and I won 't share them . You really think Ward 's back with HYDRA ? Damn it . I wanna go after him with you . You 're still on the mend . Plus , you 've been undercover with HYDRA , and that face makes an impression . The rest of you makes a bloody statement . [ Beep ] You like me stuck here in the lab . [ Chuckles ] Too bloody right . [ Beep ] You 're missing half a lung because you took a bullet Ward intended for me . Nearly bled out in my arms . If you being in the lab means I never have to see something like that again , - I 'm all for it . - Bobbi , you want to fly ? - Desperately . - Good . Here 's our destination . Who 's Professor Randolph ? This Monolith has been studied for centuries . Well , Randolph 's actually been on the planet for those centuries , and he 's traveled through space in a portal and he 's also an alien . So he 's got a lot going for him . Bobbi : Don 't die out there . And , Hunter ... make sure he does . [ Tires squealing ] [ Screaming ] Hell of a machine , Kebo . Built for precision , speed ... [ Screaming continues ] ... designed to handle flawlessly under any conditions . But Carmine here bought it as a status symbol to show off . Never opened it up , denied it of its true purpose . [ Squealing continues ] Old HYDRA 's full of guys like him ... soft , entitled , mistaking wealth for success , privilege for power . Their greed splintered HYDRA into a thousand pieces . Their time is over . Time for a leaner generation . [ Tires screech ] [ grunts ] Ward : These people have proven themselves in blood . Did you see how they didn 't even flinch ? Now 's your chance to prove you still have purpose . Show me you 're not dead weight . So , tell me where 's the kid ? - I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . - Can 't or won 't ? - Potato , puh-tah-toe . - And your reason ? The nightly news , cities flying into the atmosphere , government task forces , and now the public is freaking out about alien outbreaks . Pretty crappy time to be on Earth if you 're not a local , so I am staying low . And of course [ chuckles ] there is my current situation . Bobbi : Destruction of property , public drunkenness . Yes , well , Asgardians can generally hold their drink . It 's just , well , one night I tried to hold all the drinks . Asgardians are also strong , right ? You could easily break out . What ? And miss dinner ? [ Chuckles ] Oh , no . Yes , Norse prisons are surprisingly evolved ... decent food , comfy bed , extensive library , and no attention being drawn to me . Come back in a few months , why don 't you ? Maybe then I 'll be in the mood . - We don 't have a few months . - And neither do you . I don 't have to remind you that I saved your life , though I did just mention it in case you forgot . But I 'd still have no problems contacting those task forces you mentioned . I bet they 'd go bonkers to have a real-life Asgardian to dissect in their labs . I don 't know how comfy you 'd be there . Why , Agent Coulson ... - ... are you threatening me ? - I wouldn 't call it a ... Well , yeah , I guess I am . That 's absolutely a threat . You 're different now . You know that ? One must accommodate the times or things get messy . - What 's with the hand ? - Things got messy . Well ... you 'll have to cover my release . And if there is a portal , which I will have to see to believe , you are diving into very dangerous waters here . [ Exhales sharply ] All right . Well , it 's not like you 're giving me any choice . [ Alarm blaring ] [ panting ] He did it . [ Chuckles ] [ Engine humming ] Good to see you , Dr. Garner . [ laughs ] Hmm , enjoying the use of the private jet ? It 's very helpful . Thanks . Those jump seats aren 't made for transcontinental trips , - I 'll tell you that . - Are you hungry ? I can have something whipped up for you . - That would be great . Thanks . - Anything to drink ? - Daisy , trying to butter me up ? - What , are you not hungry ? Hey , look , my job is to keep everyone safe . Not just potential recruits , but you , as well . Bribery 's not gonna get this guy approved for the team any faster . Wouldn 't know , because you haven 't approved anyone yet . [ Clears throat ] Well , here 's , uh , Joey Gutierrez . Yeah , I was reading his file on the flight ... liquefies metal . How 's he holding up ? - Well , he 's terrified . - That 's a healthy response . - What about you two ? How are you guys doing ? - No , no . Unh-unh-unh . You are not getting me on the couch today , doc , unless it 's a conversation between friends . - That 's all I meant . - Great . How 's May ? Where is she ? Is she ever coming back ? You should ask her yourself . Well ... I would if I knew where she was . [ Sighs ] Charlie : No , no , no . You don 't watch where the ball goes . Then how would I find it ? You 're usually very good at things like this ... a natural . Yeah , well , there 's nothing natural about this game , but your comments after every swing make it super fun . - You 'll get hooked . You 'll see . - All right , fair 's fair . 10 shots for me , 5 reps for you . That 's why we 're here . Work that hip . You don 't have to worry about my rehab , and that 's not why you 're here . I may not be a spy , but 20 years with your mother has taught me to pick up on things . You 're not here because you care about me . - Oh , now I don 't care about you . - I didn 't say that . I said that 's not why you 're here . Come on , Mellie . You ... You take a trip to Honolulu with Andrew ... It was Maui . ... and you come back the daughter of the year . Something is not right . [ Sighs ] All right , I 'll figure it out for myself . [ Birds chirping ] Well , I hate to disappoint , but it looks like your regular , old ... - Oh . How often does it do that ? - It 's random . No . No , no , no , no . It may seem random . But this ... something is clearly triggering it . I 've checked it against tides , relation to the sun , rotation ... On this planet . So you have no idea how to control it . Why come to me ? I 'm no interstellar-travel expert . I 've never even studied gravitational lensing or zero-point energy fields or quantum-harmonic oscillation theory . - Yet you know all those words you just said . - And you 're scared of portals . You 're scared of being dragged back home through a portal . So I think in your drunken stumble through history , you 've probably investigated every story involving one . And I 've seen you eyeing all of your exits , my knee brace , wondering if you can get away with it . The only reason you came with us was to confirm its existence . - And destroy it . - You 'll have to go through me . And I could . Literally . But , then , I don 't know what Amazon woman and Robot hand are capable of these days , so I will help you get her back . I 'm not entirely heartless . But if I do , I want your word that we will demolish this portal and no one passes through it again . - I 'll sleep better at night . - Good . Well , I 've investigated a lot of these wormhole rumors , but that 's all they were ... rumors . None have panned out . - So we know nothing of its origin . - Kree maybe . And this parchment was found with it . Well , hello . - I 've seen this . - It 's a common Hebrew word . - Yes . - What else do we know , Mr. Fitz ? Uh , well , the Monolith changed hands a lot ... Germanic tribes , spent the hundred years ' war in France . But before the Napoleon era , it was moved again . - I lost track of it somewhere in ... - England . Yeah . How did you know that ? Because I have seen this word carved into the walls of a castle in Gloucestershire , England , in 1853 . To the plane ! Wh ... Am I allowed to say that ? Let 's all go to the plane , I guess . _ [ Indistinct conversations ] Ward : What 's the point of a boat if you never take it out of the dock ? It 's like camping in a living room . [ Chuckles ] There . There are easier ways of getting money than kidnapping . Mr. Braun needs to see the world for what it really is . He can open many doors for us . Sorry , girls . Not allowed to post , but happy to take some of you . - That 's great . - Perfect . [ Rats squeaking ] [ Woman screams ] [ Screams ] [ Indistinct shouting ] [ woman screams ] What 's going on down there ? Private party . It 's okay . I 'm on the list . [ Grunts ] - Good thing I dropped by . - Why 's that ? I 'm an exterminator . [ thud ] Yes . Yes , yes . I came here for a costume ball ... That was the pretext , of course ... 'cause I had heard rumors of travel to the stars . Found it all to be nonsense . But it was a fun party . - The carvings ? - Oh , right , right . Of course . So I was here admiring the stone work , and ... - The same as the scroll ... " Death . " - " Maveth . " Yeah , one of its translations is actually " death by punishment . " Could mean " no trespassing . " A Hebrew warning carved in an English castle struck me as odd . Out of place . Seems ancient . But you stopped looking into it ? A man dressed as an owl , of all things ... I got him drunk enough to admit that no travel to other worlds was even occurring . Just ritualistic killings . Eh , the whole thing stunk of half-baked satanism ... Just some fabrications to entice new members . And , well , there were fire dancers . I got distracted . Coulson : Here 's another one . This is why I got rid of all the S.H.I.E.L.D. logos on our vehicles . It 's like screaming for attention . You know , there 's a ginormous eagle symbol on top of our jet . Yeah , sometimes I can 't help myself with the cool . [ Rumbling ] You certain about this ? It does say " death by punishment . " After you . [ Door opens ] Let me guess . Joey Gutierrez is unfit for action physically , psychologically , and emotionally . The man can 't open a doorknob without melting it . My Psych-101 students could tell you he 's not ready . Maybe , in time . We are running out of time ! Things keep coming at us . It 's like punching a waterfall . New Inhumans , the ATCU , and this ... this new guy . You should have seen him . It was a whole new level . You want to fight fire with fire . I get it . But you can 't be reckless about it . All these people who transform have the potential to turn into monsters . But the team you do have has that danger , as well . Sounds like there 's some sage advice coming . Everywhere you turn , fires are burning . Coulson 's desperate to win on any front . But desperation leads to mistakes . Giving Hunter carte blanche to get payback , letting Fitz try to open a portal to save one life ... these are questionable decisions . You should be telling him that . He doesn 't want to hear it right now . He 's ... He is who he is . But you ... you 're still changing . You see something I don 't ? - Horns ? - You 're turning into a leader , and I 'm concerned about how you 're handling the adjustment . Wow . I totally just gave you permission to analyze me , didn 't I ? You are on a couch . Look , you are laser-focused on finding members for this team . I understand the need for these secret warriors . No , it 's more than that . When I changed , I felt like a monster . I needed help . This is a chance to show people they have a place to belong . [ Scoffs ] It sounds stupid . No , but what you 're describing sounds more like a halfway house . I 'll gladly help you build that . My mother created a halfway house for Inhumans , and it was not enough . I ... I want Inhumans taking action with S.H.I.E.L.D. to see that being different can mean making a difference . Charlie : [ chuckling ] Whoa . You chop like your mother . I think she chopped her vegetables like that as a warning to me . " Stay in line , old man . " You left the kitchen window open again . Paranoid ... a quality you share with your mother . You see her much ? Mm ... she calls me now and then to see if I 'm still living . [ Chuckles ] You haven 't called anybody yourself . Are you in hiding ? Come on over . I want to show you something . I found it while I was downsizing . - Ta-da ! - [ Scoffs ] God . You put on skates at 7 years old , and you didn 't take them off until five years later . - A natural . - I was obsessed with Dorothy Hamill . I remember that well . Mostly I remember how hard the ice was when I 'd fall ... over and over . That 's why I switched to martial arts ... padded floors . Well , and you could hit people . You expecting company ? No , but I 'm not afraid of the prospect . Aah ! Aah . What the hell are you doing here ? Uh , neighborhood watch ? [ Speaks native language ] Okay , well , this room wasn 't on the last tour . It 's an odd shape for architecture this period . Definitely built after I was here . Bobbi : Reminds me of the bunker under the Louvre . What ? There 's no bunker under the Louvre . That 's a joke , right ? You 're messing with me . All right , great . Now I 'll have to check . It 's late 1800s . [ Electricity crackling ] Still got some life to it . [ Rushing ] I hear water . Could be a stream underground , maybe hydroelectric power . [ Mechanical whirring ] - This looks a lot like it was made to hold ... - The Monolith . This machine was designed to control the portal , to open and close it at will . Coulson : Do you know that , or is that just what you hope it to be ? Well , there 's only one way to find out . [ Sighs ] [ Beep ] Mack , I need you to load something onto Zephyr-1 and bring it to us . Mack : What exactly am I bringing , sir ? Yeah ... you 're not gonna like it . You never earned a single thing in your life . You 're a waste of your family money . So ... we 're taking everything . Starting with banking passwords . Go screw your ... [ Grunts ] I 'm not asking . From here on out , you want something , you earn it . Teeth , eyes , fingers ... whatever it takes . Get the passwords . A lot of speculation back at HQ as to why you went AWOL . Spiritual walkabout , midlife crisis ... early midlife crisis . I know you didn 't elope with your ex , 'cause he 's actually been around . Hawaiian islands couldn 't rekindle that old flame , eh ? You heard about Simmons ? - Coulson and I spoke on the phone . - I know . He traced it . Pay phone at L.A.X ... . one of the surviving few . How did you find me ? Been reaching out to some of my less savory associates , trying to dig up anything I can on HYDRA . My mate in Leavenworth said they 'd received an anonymous call from a woman asking the same questions . Pay phone again . Careless . You do know that only .3 of the population of Sun City are Asian ? - What do you want ? - Your skills . I plan to put Ward six feet underground at the least . Your help would be appreciated . I 'm out . My father needs me . Oh , yeah . Car accident . Broke his hip . Police called it a hit-and-run . - Looks like Mr. May 's doing okay to me . - He 's getting there . - But they never found the driver . - It was an accident , and I 'm here to help him get back on his feet . Yeah ? Is that why you nearly decapitated me for dropping by ? Why you 're making anonymous calls to old C.I.s ? Part of you wonders if it was Ward going after the people you care about . We both know he 's capable of it . And unless I 'm off the mark , he 's out there pumping new life into HYDRA . And we both know where they 'll come knocking first . - What 's your way in ? - From below . Climb the ranks . Hail HYDRA and all that . He sees your face , you 're made . If he 's close enough to see my face , then I 'm close enough to put a bullet in his . I 'm out . I 'm gonna nab a payload from these gunrunners to establish my cover . If you change your mind . Whatever your reason , you 'll never be truly out if you 're always looking over your shoulder . And next time , it won 't be me outside the window . Zephyr-1 , you 're clear to retract . Wow . Room full of ancient gack . Kind of reminds me of your office , director . Realistically , what are the odds of this thing working ? If we were realistic , we never would have gotten this far . Well , Andrew Garner thinks I need to be more so . He recommended three months observation and counseling before reassessment for Joey . Says I 'm reckless . Don 't take it personally . He probably just meant that ... - He said you 're desperate . - What ? He didn 't say that . - Did he say that ? - Bobbi : Let me guess . I 'm struggling to come to terms with physical limitations and losing my sense of self instead of redefining it . - No , he didn 't mention you . - Oh . Oh , he did . That 's what he said . - Oh , good . - Yeah . Mack ... Mack , push that lever . No , the one ... the one that 's ... the one that 's down . The one ... the one beside it . Push it . [ Click ] [ Mechanical whirring ] [ Rumbling ] - Everybody , stay clear ! - Bobbi : Fitz , it 's working . It 's staying open . Light ! I need more light ! [ Groans ] We got a problem ! - I need some bloody light ! - Fitz ! [ Groans ] Help ... The gears have locked ! Bobbi ! Skye ? Hey . Skye , are you okay ? Skye ? - It 's Daisy . - What ? It 's Daisy now , sir ? You 're really having a hard time with this , huh ? Damn it . Yeah . Daisy , hey . - You all right ? - Yeah . I 'm better . That pulsing sound was killing me . What pulsing sound ? Are you serious ? It was deafening . Slow down . Slow down . Slow down . It holds the portal open . That flare shot straight through . if we could send a hard-wired probe through , we can see the other side . - We can find her . - We 'll fix the machine , Turbo ... - We have to fix it . - ... but you got to chill ... How are we supposed to fix a machine we don 't know how it works ? [ grunts ] [ laughs ] I figured you for a mama 's boy . One slap , and you spit out the info . [ Grunting ] It 's been a good run , kid . Now , let 's just get to the end . [ Grunting ] Come on . [ Breathing heavily ] Okay . You win . [ Both grunt ] Nobody treats me like that and lives . Raah ! Do you even know who the hell I am ? Do you ? ! Ward : You 're Werner von Strucker . Your father was Baron Wolfgang von Strucker , one of HYDRA 's greatest leaders . Powerful family name doesn 't mean you deserve respect . You earn that . I wondered if you had it in you . Your old man would be proud . Come on . Brought tacos . [ Crickets chirping ] [ Lock clicks ] Unfinished business ? Is that what you 're in hiding from ? [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] You and your mother . Silence always means yes . - You take after her in that way . - In every way . So that 's what this visit is all about ? Things with you and Andrew did not work out so well , so you feel damaged in some way . But there are worse things to be than your mother 's daughter . [ Sighs ] [ glass thuds ] I just want to have a normal life , dad , away from S.H.I.E.L.D. - I want to see if I can . - Normal ? With a handgun in your golf bag ? Trying to protect me from some unfinished business that follows you like a shadow ? You remember the pain when you hit the ice , but I always remember how quickly you would get up . I was a kid . It didn 't hurt as much then . My daughter always got back up . [ Door opens ] You needed a push . I had to know you could handle the fall . - I should have you killed . - Okay . First thing , if you 're gonna kill someone , don 't threaten them . Just do it . - Oh , my father would have you ... - Your father kept you in the dark and then died a meaningless death , leaving you to hide your face with no answers . I know what it 's like to come from a complicated family . HYDRA 's fractured , in pieces . We 're gonna rebuild it .. the right way ... by force . My father so rarely let me see any of his world . It 's your world now . And when we put these pieces back together , they 'll be stronger than the original . It 'll just rattle apart again . We have to reinforce the connections . Reinf ... look , most of the workings are under the ground . We just can 't tear the castle down . And actually , we 're lucky the room is shaped this way , or the machine might have shaken it apart on top of us . [ Grunts ] Wait . [ Metal clangs ] Wait . Yeah , yeah , yeah . That 's the point . Quantum harmonic oscillation theory , like the professor said . - I know that look . - It 's a strange shape for this time period because it 's made to resonate , uh , to ... to ... to ... uh ... create a-a quantized field within the stone . Fitz , you 're talking , but we 're not totally following . The room is a speaker . The machine is an amplifier . Uh , a sub ... subsonic frequency to resonate with the Monolith . You saying you figured out - a way to fix the machine ? - No . - I 'm saying I figured out that ... - We don 't have to . I can do it . I can open the portal myself . Well , turns out we 're standing in the middle - of the world 's largest subwoofer . - Yeah . If the point of the machine was to resonate the room at a certain frequency , I can do that . - And you can replicate it ? - Kind of drilled into my brain . And it could kill you . How long do you think you can hold it ? - Maybe a minute . - If it 's too much , you pull back . - I can 't lose you , too . - I got this . Here we go . Camera and data sensors are hard-lined back to us through a cable ... no signal loss that way . If Daisy can hold it , we 'll get a visual of the other side . That 's what we 're looking for . All right , you listen to me . You take care of yourself . - We lose that probe , nobody cares . - Uh , I 'm confused . What exactly is she planning to do here ? [ Rumbling ] [ Strained ] Sorry . Still tuning . [ Breathing heavily ] Hold it open as long as you can . Fitz , no ! [ Wind gusting ] [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] Jemma ! Jemma ! Jemma ! [ Wind gusting ] Jemma ! Simmons : Fitz ! Fitz ! Jemma ? ! [ Breathing heavily ] Jemma ? ! - Jemma ! - Fitz ! [ Grunts ] Damn it . Pull him back ! Get him back here . Aah ! I can 't hold it ! No ! [ Gasps , coughs ] [ Panting ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Panting ] You did good , tremors . You did good . [ Panting ] Fitz ... No sign of radiation or infection . Fitz would never have found her , but she saw the flare . We brought a woman back from the dead today . And , happily , you kept up your end of the bargain . The portal is destroyed . - Thank Daisy for that . - Yeah . Agent Coulson ... - what exactly is Daisy ? - They call themselves Inhumans . I have not heard that word in a very long time . Yes ? Your team pulled off a miracle today . Fitz got Simmons back . I thought you deserved to know . They think she 's gonna be okay if you want to come back and see her . Or stay . I think headquarters is big enough for the two of us . I 'm glad she 's safe . Simmons is back . She 's okay . Are you serious ? She 's alive ? Fitz , you absolute beauty ! Come on , beers ? ! Let 's get a beer on it ! Come on May , small for once in your eye . [ Gasps ] [ Breathing shakily ] Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . First thing tomorrow morning , all right ? - Man : Dr. Garner ? - Yeah . Yeah ? I 'm sorry for the intrusion , but I was hoping to add your class . - You okay with a few weeks ' makeup work ? - Yeah , I-I just transferred . - I think psychology might be my major . - Okay . You know why most people take psych , right ? Ahh , damn this pen . Here . Give me your back . They 're trying to figure out their families . You got me there . You wouldn 't believe how messed up mine is . He 's moving North ! [ Panting ] - A nation terrified of Inhumans . - Tell your men to stand down . - They will start a war . - They are people ... You are not cursed . You are not some horrible thing . ... with real human emotions . You 're wasting your time caring about me . I know the real you . Until they are betrayed ... You know what I want . ... by those they trust .

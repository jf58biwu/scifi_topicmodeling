 Follow the lady . Come on . Hey , diddle diddle , who is in the middle ? Come on , let 's play . You see , you follow the lady . Come on , ladies and gentlemen . Hey , diddle diddle , who is in the middle ? No . Come on . Bet . Bet , bet , bet , come on ! - Are you sure ? - Yes . Yes . Come on . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Sorry . - Try again ? - OK , again . Try again . So ... follow the lady . OK ? Is it here ? Two , three ... It 's here . - And make your bet . - ( ALL TALK AT ONCE ) - This one . - Sure ? - Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Yes . Come on . - Are you sure ? This is a cheat ! This is a fix ! It 's a cheat ! This is life . Always . Win some . Lose some . ( SHOUTS IN BENGALI ) ( ALL SHOUT ) ( ALL SHOUT ) ( MAN SHOUTS ) ( EXPLOSION ) - WOMAN : We need to go ! - ( HARRY GROANS ) ( SIREN ) ( GASPS ) ( GASPS ) ( SIREN ) MAN : Look straight ahead . He 's been involved in an accident so we 'd like to run some more tests . If he suffered concussion , we will need to monitor him but despite being under water , his lungs appear clear and his blood pressure 's fine . Thank you . ( SIGHS ) My God . What a mess . Um ... Yeah . How is he ? - You OK ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Honestly . SURI : Ben , take it slowly . They 've given me a thorough going over . I 'm alright . Thanks to this hero . SURI : You 've been in a serious accident . - Why don 't you let them check you ? - No , I just need to go home . - I 'll give you a text . - We 'll give you a lift . I 'm not getting in another vehicle with you . I just need to go to bed . ( SOUND OF DOOR BEING UNLOCKED ) Thanks . HARRY : Mmm . I can never get them as soft as this . All it takes is patience . When are you going back to your meetings ? I 've already started . Going most evenings after work . But not last night . So ... what happened ? Nothing . Just the usual . That 's two lies in a row . Harry ... It was a rough night . I just wanted to come and see you , you know . - Dad ! - Daisy ! Hello , love . Oh ! - How 's that arm ? - Good . Yeah ? Kevin Grey 's been on the move for five hours . We 're reviewing CCTV footage but there are a lot of black spots . - So I 'd like to concentrate on ... - DS Chohan , a word ? WINTER : I see you 're doing Harry 's paperwork for him . That 's dutiful of you . Well , to be frank , after what he did last night , I thought he could use a break . Yes , he did very well . Harry 's a great man for a crisis . He 's decisive . Brave . Heroic , even . I mean , it is obvious why you admire him . Very few of us could have done what he did last night . Then again , even fewer of us would have allowed that situation to develop . It was risky , what he did . It is curious , don 't you think ? All this chaos and as ever , not a scratch on Harry Clayton . Somethings not right here . What 's the simple solution to the Kayleigh Fenchurch and Lau murders ? That Kevin Grey killed them both because he was jealous that Kayleigh left him for Lau . HARRY : Yeah , but if it was a simple crime of passion , why would Grey need a speedboat and a private plane to flee the country ? No , Kayleigh was murdered as a message to Freddie Lau and when Freddie failed to listen , somehow Grey was manipulated into killing him . No mention of Kevin Grey on the paperwork . Or any passengers . Do we know where Grey was headed ? The manifest says Paris , Dubai and then Macau . - You speak Chinese ? - Cantonese . Just a little . Oh , course you do . Must brush up on it myself . The hire account is 26 Broadworth Street ! The Green Dragon Casino ! OK , so Lily-Anne wants Kevin Grey out of the country . But why this ? Why get a private plane ? How many millions is this worth , huh ? Walnut finish , fancy upholstery . ( FAINT CRUNCH ) Oh , Lily-Anne . - Where 's Kevin Grey ? - I have no idea . Even though he was about to get on a private plane hired by you ? You mean the plane picking up relatives for my father 's memorial ? Is hiring a plane a crime ? No , but stuffing it full of cash is . Oh , dear . I 'm afraid I must plead ignorance on that front . Maybe you should speak to the charter company . Lily-Anne , did you force Kevin Grey into killing your father ? Detective Clayton , what must you think of me ? No , I don 't think you did . Someone else did . Someone you 're afraid of . Lily-Anne , tell me where Kevin Grey is . I can protect you . I think we both know why you really came here . Those tables upstairs are calling your name . You know , Harry , my father liked men like you . Weak , broken men . You reminded him of himself . That 's why he gave you credit . And weak and broken as you are , you abused that credit . So now I own you , Detective Clayton . You are mine to do with as I please . Dismissed . WINTER : But you , my Lord , are a shield about me . Lifter of my head . I cried aloud to the Lord and he answered me from his holy mountain . I lie down and sleep . Clayton definitely was into Lau for a very large sum . Everyone says so . I want evidence . Somebody out there has a record of this transaction . - I 'll keep looking , sir . - No . No , that 's not good enough . Do you understand what I was sent here to do , Orwell ? I 've come here to clean this rotten organization from within and I 'm entrusting you to work with me on this . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Uh ... hi ? Good morning. ls your daddy home ? ANNA : Who is it , darling ? - Yes ? - I 'm looking for Harry Clayton . I 've no idea where he is . Perhaps I can come inside and discuss it ? Absolutely not . Who are you ? Well , another time , then . Have a nice day . MAN : Anna . Who was that ? Uh ... No one . Just go and get dressed . ( PHONE RINGS ) - Anna ? - Why is there a bailiff at my door ? OK , I 'm on my way . Don 't worry , I handled it . But , please , no more , Harry . The new chief wants to speak to you . - ( DOOR OPENS ) - You wanted to see me ? I have information that you owed Lau a large sum of money . Money that you couldn 't possibly pay back on a detectives salary . - Who said that ? - You don 't deny it then ? I 'm not responding to some ... rumor . Who told you that ? No , I like to protect my sources as much as you . In any case , it doesn 't matter . But what would matter is if you let Grey escape in order to keep the suspicion on him . You think I killed Freddie Lau ? You certainly had the motive . I nearly lost my life trying to catch Grey last night . Recklessness won 't win you any points . - I 'm going back to work . - DI Clayton , if you can 't or won 't find Grey ... Orwell will . Orwell ? He couldn 't find his face in the mirror . ORWELL : Scrap everything you heard . I want to keep it tight . I want you to start here , set a radius and just sweep . - Door to door . House to house . - No one 's talking about Grey . The street chatter 's all about Kayleigh Fenchurch 's funeral . SURI : Did you get anything from Lily-Anne ? No . Nothing except a plausible denial . What 's he gonna do ? Is he gonna search the whole of London street by street in the hope of finding him ? Grey is in the wind . Still can 't believe they let him commandeer my map ! - I brought those pins from home . - ( LAUGHS ) Grey needs to get out of the country quick and quiet . Who can fix that for him ? Very good . I don 't know , but I know a man who might . Come on . - ( BELL ) - Josie . Boss , there 's a sudden smell of bacon in the shop . Don 't flirt , Josie . I 'm a married man . Oh , Jesus , Josie ! I thought you meant the actual police . Just have to have a quick word with my brother . Take a look around . Have you managed to look into the um ... the thing ? Your wee bracelet ? Scrape test came back inconclusive . What does that mean ? The machine 's buggered . Happens . Rich , someone tried to kill me over this . Tried to chop my bloody arm off . It 's driving me a bit crazy . You know , I think I might even be ... powerful . I mean , how did she get it on in the first place ? Harry , are you on crack ? - Just find out what it is , will you ? - OK , I will . Is this cuneiform , Mr Clayton ? Oh , please , it 's Rich . And uh ... yes , yes , it is . Yours for only 200 grand . You must know how to get your hands on things . Well , I 've got that reputation . Great . You can help us then . We 're looking for Kevin Grey , a murder suspect . We believe he 's an imminent flight risk . - What 's that got to do with me ? - If you needed to leave the country without being traced , how would you do it ? I ... have ... no idea . I mean , I might know some back channels for a few things but uh ... professional ethics and all that . OK , we 'll try somewhere else then . Good luck . Oh , just one more thing . That 's a Babylonian Museum mark . So unless you 've got the paperwork , it 's been looted , and since you 're not involved in anything like that , I know you 'd want us to call the Iraqi Embassy for you . Professional ethics and all that . Rich , I didn 't properly introduce you . This is DS Chohan . She 's , um ... very good . Hmm . You 'd need a fake passport and transport . I 've heard around the Garden that there 's this new guy . Follow the lady . Come on ! Hey , diddle diddle , who is in the middle ? Come on ! The cards are a distraction . Why else do it here ? - See ? - I 'll get him . You get the card guy . No . Wait . Let 's test this out . - Are you sure ? Follow the lady , yeah ? - Mm-hm . It 's here . No . It 's here . Choose . Let 's play again , yeah ? And I 'll beat you this time . - I give you four to one . - Four to one ? - Yeah . OK ? - OK . OK . Just follow the lady , yeah ? Choose . - ( PEOPLE GASP ) - H-How did you do that ? MAN : Hmm ? Let 's play again . Just play . No bet , OK ? - OK . - OK ? Choose . Come on , choose ! - ( PEOPLE GASP ) - How do you do that ? Police ! ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( MAN SHOUTS ) Well , what do we do now ? Like I said , the cards are just a distraction . - ( PHONE RINGS ) - MAN : Hello ? Well , if it isn 't Barry the Wizard ! How you doing , big man ? MAN : Ah , Clayton . Not a social call , I expect . Alas , no . Listen , what can you tell me about the phone I 'm calling from ? Can you give me the name of the owner ? Address ? No . It 's a pay-as-you-go , bought just off the Tottenham Court Road . Uh ... Looking at my maps , it shows up most at a lock-up garage in Bermondsey . Text that address through to me , would you , Barry ? Thanks . - OK , will do , nice to ... - ( ENDS CALL ) Right , let 's follow the lady , shall we ? ( BEEPING ) ( DOOR UNLOCKS ) Hello . ( GROANS ) HARRY : Nice place you got here . Interesting stuff . Ooh , the Green Dragon . Thanks . Immigration 's gonna love you . How did you beat me ? Hmm ? HARRY : Ah . Customers . Kevin Grey . This man 's wanted for murder . - Where is he ? - How ? We need to know tonight ! No ? I 'll tell you what . Why don 't I call some of the contacts on your phone , eh ? Ask them a few questions . Try not to make it too obvious that I 'm police . You might even survive the night . How did you beat me , man ? - Where 's Kevin Grey ? - ( YELLS ) Tell me . OK . You tell me where Kevin Grey is , I 'll tell you how I beat you . He called me and he beg like a dog . So I got him a space in a storage crate on a ship to Greece . It leaves Portsmouth at noon . I don 't know where he is now but that 's where he 'll be tomorrow . ( GROANS ) Now tell me , how did you beat me ? Huh ? ( MAN SHOUTS ) You lied to him . He didn 't have a tell . His cheek never twitched . - No , it didn 't . - So ... How did you do it ? ( MAN SHOUTS ) What are we doing with him ? He 'll get out eventually . Let 's leave him in play for now . Besides , we 've got a shiny new source for ourselves . A guy that can fake passports and find transport 'll be in demand . ( PHONE RINGS ) WINTER : Yeah ? Our info is that Grey will be in a storage crate at Portsmouth docks at noon tomorrow . We 'll be there to pick him up . What 's Orwell got ? I haven 't caught up with him yet . Good work , Harry . Harry got there first . I 'm tired of all this ... talk . I 'm going to get you something you can take to Internal Affairs . Soon . I hope so . When Clayton 's gone , I 'm going to need somebody I can trust . I am your eyes and ears , sir . OK , so there 's a train at 8 : 36 in the morning . Great . So , fancy some dinner ? A pint ? You 're going to see Ben . - He said he needed rest . - Yeah , that was in front of me . Go and ... tuck him in . I can 't believe I 'm getting advice on my personal life from Harry " Lose My House In A Card Game " Clayton . Right . I 'll see you tomorrow morning at Waterloo then . Alright . Just after eight , OK ? By which stage my private affairs will be 100 per cent in order . ( DOOR BURSTS OPEN ) ( SCREAMS ) ( DOOR OPENS ) We 're closed tonight . Out of respect . HARRY : I 've got a line on Kevin Grey . Thought I 'd give you the chance to tell me anything you know before he does . Since we 're such good friends . - And what would I know ? - Who convinced Grey to kill Lau ? Your view of the world is very dark and twisted , Detective . Whoever was trying to force Lau out got to Grey . Lily-Anne ? Someone else ? You can tell me , or Grey will . The girl he was crazy about was found in the Thames . Grey blamed the guy who took her from him . Then he just happened to try and board a private plane hired by Lily-Anne ? If you have a charge , why don 't you put the cuffs on me and we can cha-cha ? If not , I have Kayleigh 's funeral to arrange . You 're very welcome to attend . If you can find the time . Hi . - Hello . - Look , last night made me think . I mean , there are a lot of problems . We work together . I 'm Hindu . You 're a ... nothing . I support Spurs , you 're a bloody Gooner . And we 're both a bit , you know , crap at emotions . But I 've decided that um ... we 're going out now . Officially . Cos I might love you a bit . And I think you love me a bit back . Mainly cos you 're not stupid . - OK ? - OK . God , that was awful . So , can I come in and get naked with you , please ? - ( LAUGHS AWKWARDLY ) - What is it ? Hello , dear . You must be Ben 's mum . ( LAUGHS ) Come in . My little boy 's got ... very bad eyesight . A few months , he 'll be b-b-b-b-blind . Phil , stop looking at your phone . She 's m-m-m-making me fall asleep . WOMAN : There 's a new treatment in Prague . NHS won 't do it yet but ... I 'll try anything . So my mum 's cashed in her ISA savings to p-pay for us to go but I g-g-9-9-- - ( SOBS ) I lost n all . I love my son so much . But I 've f-f-f-f-f ... I messed everything up again . So that 's it . Harry ... Well , you haven 't been here for a while . Do you want to share anything ? Hello , everyone , my name is Harry C and I 'm a compulsive gambler . I haven 't placed a bet for ... four days . ALL : Hi , Harry . You 're all making me feel so old . Didn 't realize they allowed toddlers to bet . Is there a reason you 've come back ? Someone asked me a question the other day . What if luck was something you could own ? What if someone gave you something that made you really lucky ? Something that caused amazing things to happen . I 'd get rid of it . What if you couldn 't ? ( LAUGHS ) It 's mad . I know it 's mad . Harry , this is your disease talking . Go home . Write everything down . Winnings and losses . You 'll see exactly what this charm of yours is costing you . - ( BELL ) - COMMENTATOR : And they 're Off ! One breaks well with four in second followed by two , three and five . One runs to the front there in the black . Still one . - Four at the back ... - ( CROWD SHOUT S ) " followed by two . ( COMMENTARY CONTINUES , DROWNED OUT BY CROWD ) Thank you . COMMENTATOR : Dogs are arriving . Dogs are arriving . One minute . One minute now . ( BELL ) And they 're off . One breaks well , followed by two , five and four . And at the first bend it 's one . With six last and well off the pace . It 's still one . Six still last and trailing by live lengths . - I 'll swap you . - What ? - Swap tickets . I 've got number one . - Yeah . Alright . Yeah . It 's one , two and five very close . Going on ahead now . From two , five and ... There seems to be a problem with the hare . The dogs are all pulling up . Except for six . Six goes on into the last bend . Six enters the last straight and six crosses the line . Did you fix this ? No . COMMENTATOR : Due to a mechanical error , the race is void . All bets are cancelled . Return your slip for a refund . Yeah , well , you can thank your lucky stars , mate . Harry . - You ! - What do you think you 're doing ? That bracelet 's not for playing games . - What is it for ? - You know what it is . - You felt its power . - Why , then ? Why did you give it to me ? - To shine light on the shadows . - What ? You have to go . Now . We have to run . Trust me . - WOMAN : Harry ! - He tried to kill me . Harry , luck like this has a price . Do something good with it ! ( GUNSHOT / SCREAMING ) Morning , Chohan . Is that the walk of shame I see ? Please stop talking . - Ah , young love . Remember it well . - Shut up ! Endless hours of poetry , baths , stubble rash ... - What train are we on ? The 8 : 36 ? - Uh-huh . Did you collect the tickets ? Yes , Mum , got them here . 8 : 36 . Wait ! Kevin Grey loved Kayleigh Fenchurch . He 's not gonna be on that boat . He 's gonna pay his respects . We have to act on our information . It 's too big a risk . He 's going to be at Kayleigh 's funeral . This is our one chance at catching him . Trust me . This is something I wrote . K is for krazy , the times we had together . A is for amazing , the memories that will live with me forever . I is for love , which is what I felt for you . I is for intelligent , the jokes that made me laugh . - G is for gorgeous ... - He 's not here . - You even looked good in the bath . - HARRY : He will be . ( PHONE BEEPS ) Hold on , I 'll call you back in a second . - Hello ? - WINTER : Harry , where are you ? Just pulling into the harbor station now . Anything happen on the journey ? No . Listen , um ... I can 't really talk . We 're cutting it a bit close , timewise . Indeed . Well , I look forward to seeing you when you 're back at headquarters . Come on ! ( WOMAN SINGS RUN BY SNOW PATROL ) This is a funeral , Detective . Have you no shame ? You know , I thought the authorities back home were stupid . But not even those hairy goat-fiddlers would be so idiotic as to expect a fugitive to attend the funeral of his victim . Ladies and gentlemen , our boys and girls in blue . HARRY : What 's happening now ? Nothing . I can 't believe that I didn 't get on that train . We 've blown it . It doesn 't make sense . I 'm sorry . I hate these places . ( TIRES SCREECH ) - ( BANG ) - Oh , God ! Oh , God ! It 's ... It 's alright , boys . I 'm gonna get us out of here . Jesus ! Come on , get your seat belt off , you can do it . I 'll take care of Frank . Go ! Go ! Go , Harry ! Go ! It 'll be fine ! ( EXPLOSION ) Are you OK ? I haven 't been to a funeral since I was five years old . My brother ... My twin brother and I were in a car accident . My mother was driving . I was OK , I got out , but they , um ... I spent the entire service hiding underneath a pew . I could feel everyone looking at me , thinking , " Maybe it 's his fault . " I 'm sure they weren 't , Harry . Maybe they were just wondering why you were hiding underneath the pew . Grey can 't face the family . Not if they thought he killed her . Kevin . Kevin , don 't . Kevin , don 't ! - Quick ! - Stop ! ( GROANS ) - You OK ? - Go ! Hey ! ( PANTS ) ( Y ELLS ) - Take him and give me five minutes . - We 'll need to have a drink . Yeah , I know we will . Alright , Steve ? - What 's going on ? - Train crash , Harry . SURI : We were meant to be on that train . You 're a lucky man , Harry Clayton . MAN ON TV : We 're getting more images coming in from today 's rail incident . There are currently around 40 injuries reported . No fatalities have been confirmed as yet . 15 : 35 on April the 3rd . Interviewing the suspect Kevin Grey are DI Clayton and DS Chohan . Noting that the suspect has agreed to be interviewed without having a lawyer present . - Can we hurry this up ? - Have you got somewhere to be ? HARRY : Who told you that Freddie Lau had killed Kayleigh ? Why else would you have murdered him ? You thought that Freddie had taken the life of the woman you loved . GREY : I know Freddie didn 't do it . - I did . - Sorry ? I 'm pleading guilty to both murders , Your Honor . We 're not charging you for Kayleigh 's murder . Why are you lying ? ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Mr Grey , I 'm here to represent you . - Who are you ? - Your solicitor . Interview suspended 15 : 36 . - Who sent you ? - My firm . - What are you doing ? - My job . Can we just be professional about this ? We 're still a married couple , remember ? We both can 't work on this case . Well , then , why don 't you go home ? Next , please . How 's your son ? 3.80 , please . Yeah . Here . Keep the change . - This is thousands ! - HARRY : Take it . That treatment 's expensive , right ? - I can 't . - Please . I don 't ... - I don 't want charity . - You 'd be helping me . Honestly . And it 's not for you anyway . I 'm gonna come back here and I want to see photos of your wee lad playing football in the park . Don 't let me down . Thank you . ( SIGHS ) ( KISSING SOUNDS ) What 's up ? This is just between us . It bothers me that Harry put you both in danger to catch Grey . Yeah , but he got him , though , didn 't he ? And do you know what ? He 's the only one who could have managed it . Also , he knows that I 'm proper nails so ... - Idiot . - ( LAUGHS ) But all these risks . One day , I 'm just ... How about you stop talking about Harry when you 're in bed with me ? Shall we get the iPad out and watch Modern Family ? Do you mind if we don 't ? I feel a bit tired . Ben , are you OK ? Yeah . Just need to ... ( THUD ) ( PHONE RINGS ) - Suri . - Harry ! It 's Ben ! He 's uh ... He 's ... - What ? - SURI : I 've called an ambulance . I 'm on my way . Ben , we 're nearly at the hospital . ( $ 055 ) ( SIREN ) ( BEEPING ) ( CONTINUOUS BEEP )

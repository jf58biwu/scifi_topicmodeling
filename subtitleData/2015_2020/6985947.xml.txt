 - He 's looking better already . - Maybe . He still hasn 't said a word . It 's going to take time . They have the best doctors in the world here . It 's gonna happen . - Nervous ? - No . Maybe . A little bit . No . - Are you turning soft on me ? - No , I can 't . I 'm on call . I thought this was a celebration . It is ... kinda . While waiting anxiously for alterplex to launch what the company claims to be the final generation of energy solutions . If you 're joining us now , we are less than a minute away from entering a new future . This is really big for me . I want it to be good for you guys too , you know . I know . And I 'm proud of you . I think . Alterplex gives the green light ! Hey , Donny ? - Donny , come stand here . - T minus 50 . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six ... Thanks for being here . Are you kidding ? Three , two ... Oh ... it 's okay . What 's it doing ? Ha . It 's working . Okay . Okay . Shit . Ah , I 'm exiting the lab . Oh ! Uh ... Unidentified male body . Identified as Dr. klintsen . Oh , god . Shit ... This is will Porter , mission log one . Uncertain as to my coordinates . The jump was most likely successful , but I can 't confirm . Personal bci non-responsive . New bci procured , but battery depleting . Writing is ... mirrored ? Either I 'm in the echo or I 've sustained serious cerebral damage during jump . Lab appears critically damaged . Destruction appears recent . Multiple deceased scattered among the rubble , including Dr. klintsen . Heading outside to try and confirm coordinates . This is mission log two . Outside of lab . More deceased here . Oh , god ... I have a visual on the tower . Before executing the objectives , I need to verify if this is really the echo . Shit ! Sorry , buddy . - Will ? - Abby ? - Oh , my god , will ! - What ... what happened ? ! We thought you were dead . Where are you ? We 'll come and get you . Wait , Abby , I need to know what happened . Where have you been ? The lab was attacked , will . The box was destroyed . We moved to a camp on the outside ... wait . Back up . What 'd you say about the box ? - I said they destroyed the box ! - Destroyed ? How ? Who 's they ? ! They shot the place up , will . I ... I saw it . Are you sure the box was destroyed ? I 'm sending you our coordinates . What the fuck is going on ? Alterplex cares . We understand . The future of mankind is not out there . It is in here . And we have found a solution . We have developed a clean and simple way of converting mass into pure energy . In just a few more months , we will launch our energy tower , powering our world for millennia to come . Alterplex energy . Clean . Simple . Safe . Mr. Porter . Abigail vos , chief of alterplex operations . - Welcome . - Thank you . I believe you 're familiar with my partner . Dr. klintsen . This is a great honour , sir . You know , I was researching at NASA when you introduced duplicate matter theory . That was the find of the decade . You 're a rock star down there . We are very excited you 're here , will . Mr. Reynard apologizes that he couldn 't be meeting you in person . Sure . Hi . I have a lot of questions . Your people were very good at keeping me in the dark . Well , these people are in the dark too . So ... a physicist who can fly . It 's no wonder NASA poached you from the air force . It 's impressive . Uh , thank you . Sorry , what is going on ? These NASA assessments claim you have ... " Little to no risk aversion . " A similar view held by your flight-school instructors . Those assessments are classified . Wait . Is this ... is this some kind of a job interview ? 'Cause , you know , I appreciate the mystery flights and everything , but I could 've saved you all a lot of time and trouble . I am not interested . Thank you . You haven 't heard our offer . Well ... I have a number of obligations back in the United States . Personal ones . We are aware of your sister and nephew . And your new surrogate-father role . And the surrounding circumstances . It 's very noble of you , will . Mr. Reynard respects your position , which is why our generous relocation package includes all three of you . Donny will have access to a world-class private school . It 's a little more complicated than that . And the finest trauma specialists in all of Europe . With the compensation we 're prepared to offer , your sister would never need to work . Will , this is not a job offer . This is the ... Opportunity to explore ... impossible frontiers . Well I 've already been to space , so ... Space is possible . Then what are we talking about ? After that , I 'm going to need your signature . Hi ! You 've reached Mia and Donny . We 're not here right now , so please leave a message after the ... Beep ... ! Mia , it 's will . Just call me when you get this . This is will Porter . Mission log three . I can now confirm that the jump was successful . My location is the echo . Unprecedented ! This is amazing . Echo diagnostics are still loading . Currently at 57 % . Answer on gravitational stability forthcoming . Eight kilometres from the tower . Eta just over an hour . What ... The fuck is going on ? Oh , my god . Must get out of here . Okay , just get to the tower , just get this done . We can get outta here and go home , okay ? Oh , crap . Oh , my god . What the hell 's going on ? There was ... There was a lot of shouting , a lot of ... lot of confusion . And then they just started shooting ! First , they were shooting and they were going after alterplex guys , but I saw a woman hit just get out of her car and I 'm pretty sure they had nothing to do with alterplex ! The leader of the militant environmental group , calling themselves the rebels , put out a statement today justifying their assault on the alterplex laboratory and tower , accusing the energy plant of endangering the entire planet by turning on its tower a week ago , citing the subsequent destabilization of the system . Meanwhile , alterplex , which has been allowed to deploy its own security drones after issuing the controversial alterplex security act , made a joint announcement with the police that the evacuation zone surrounding the tower has been increased to 75 kilometres . Oh , my god ! What the ... ? Mission log four . Just had possible visual on a gravitational anomaly . The box is still loading . Approaching anomaly . Definitely some sort of gravitational portal at the base of the cloud line . Seems to be active still . Lots of static charge , a tendril or a jet , like a tornado but ionized . Moving towards the anomaly now . It looks like a small ... boat ? Uh ... Numerous deceased birds ... Surrounding the anomaly . Uh , the boat is mainly intact , so maybe inverse gravity ? The portal is still really active . Seems to be sucking the atmosphere . Yikes ! I ah ! Oh , my ... Oh ! What are you doing ? Drone down ! Drone down ! Everybody regroup ! Come on ! - Who 's that guy ? - What ? Where ? Take him out now ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! It 's alright , it 's okay ! - Move away from the door ! - I 'm trying to find a way ... and you ! Hands high ! Hold your hands high ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! - Hey , stop ! - Shoot him ! Stop ! Stop it ! You 're coming out . I know you 're there ! Give you three seconds ! Stop ! Michael ? - Will ? - Why are you shooting at me ? ! You wanna put the gun down and tell me what the fuck is going on ? ! What the fuck are you doing with these psychos ? ! You 're alterplex ! You 're alive . That ... Th-that 's not possible . Why not ? Why not ? What happened ? Michael , talk to me . Tell me what you saw . Tell me , did something happen to me ? Michael ? What the hell is happening here , man ? - Whoa-whoa-whoa ... - What the hell 's happening ? ! Put the gun down , put the gun down ! I 'll tell you what 's happening , but first you gotta answer me ! Bullshit . How did you survive ? How did you survive ? Shit ! Warning ! Citizen , you are trespassing in a restricted area . You are violating alterplex security act 7.1 . Stop , or we will engage . You are trespassing in a restricted area . Stop , or we will shoot . I work for alterplex . My name is will Porter . Remain where you are . We have name listed as deceased . Take four steps forward and lie face-down , arms and legs spread . Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Let me prove it to you ! Let me prove it to you . Positive identification . You are under arrest . Remain where you are . A transport is on its way . It will escort you to alterplex command in a few seconds . Remain where you are . Since the dawn of humankind , we have reached for dreams beyond our grasp . We gazed at the birds and built planes to fly . We gazed at the moon and built rockets to reach it . Throughout history , we have transcended our evolution with technology , pushing through to new frontiers . Now alterplex 's visionary ceo , August Reynard , asks you to gaze at the energy challenge we face , and , once again , push through to a new frontier . After decades of research , we are proud to finally unveil the future of energy harnessing and realize our dream for a better tomorrow , powering us for millennia to come . This is a notification for all alterplex personnel . Reminder : Due to the increased violent protests , the emergency security policy will now also include sectors five , seven and ten . Yes . Uh , no . We 're not there yet . We 're still waiting on the ... Diagnostics report , yeah . Well , I 'll check on him . I 'll check him . Yeah . Okay . So glad you 're here , will . Sorry . Launch logistics . Clock is ... ticking . How are Mia and Donny adjusting ? Well ... a little up and down , to tell you the truth . Uh ... You know , new city and everything . They have a lot of questions . And frankly , I still don 't fully understand what I 'm doing here myself . Oh . Before we go any further ... This is for you . It 's not a gift , I 'm afraid . It 's a locator . Keep it on at all times . Once we 're live , you 're on call 24 / 7 . - 24 / 7 ? - Exactly . Shall we proceed ? Alright . Ms. vos . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? You must be will . Michael . Welcome to alterplex . Can 't stay here . We should keep moving . Look at what they 've done . And what about what you did , Michael ? - We raided the lab ... - What happened to you ? There 's a lot of dead people . You can 't be here . There 's just no way ... Why is there no way ? You asked me how I survived , you said it 's not possible I 'm alive . Why ? I saw you die , will . I saw you die . Come on . What is this ? What in hell is really going on down here ? Run it , please . After the end of fossil fuels , mankind is faced with its greatest challenge yet . With the world 's energy consumption tripling in the last decade alone , a new form of sustainable energy is needed . A system that outshines solar , wind and even nuclear energy . After years of research , we at alterplex have found the answer to the energy crisis by leveraging the immense hidden power of m-theory , first proposed by Edward witten in 1995 , and enhanced by pieter klintsen 's duplicate-matter theory . M-theory unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory . By deconstructing space-time into a higher number of dimensions , our tower is able to create a mirrored echo of our local universe . You 're copying the entire universe ? Symmetry down to every last quantum particle , with one crucial difference . The echo universe will be devoid of organic compounds . Instead , it will be a lifeless cosmos providing a limitless amount of matter that can be transformed into power . Acting as a dimensional conductor , the tower will create multiple gravity portals , which will harvest the echo 's mass and convert it into pure electromagnetic energy . This energy is then transferred cleanly and safely into our world , powering it for millennia to come . I had the exact same face . - Parallel universes ? - An echo universe . And this here is where you come in . This is the gate . It sends you into the echo , a safe distance from the tower . You will be carrying this box . The box will counterbalance any instabilities that might occur in the echo . - Instabilities ? - Very simple . It plugs right into the echo tower . Someone needs to get it there . - Okay . May I ? - Yeah . Just plug it in ? That 's it ? That 's it . There 's a terminal at the base of the echo tower . You jump over , take the box to the tower , plug it in and jump back in time for dinner . Michael , nobody was supposed to have been copied , no living thing . This was supposed to be a sterile world , devoid of carbon life . I don 't know what went wrong . - So you 're saying that ... - Hmm ? - They 've copied the entire world ? - Well ... - the entire universe ? - Kinda . - How 's that even possible , man ? You really don 't wanna get into that right now . But ef-effectively , yes . Yes . - So there 's two of me . - Possibly . - Of everyone ? - Well ... not everyone . Not me anymore , I guess . But I 'm here to fix that . I have to get this to the tower . Uh ... " Redivider . " What does it mean ? I don 't know . They didn 't brief me on redivider . What about shit like this , man ? They never briefed you about trains falling out of the fucking sky ? The system should 've been one way , harvesting energy from the echo , from ... this universe into the real world . But maybe the echo is fighting back somehow ? It 's sucking stuff back ? Heavy objects from the real world . I don 't know , maybe it 's balancing out what 's lost . Jesus Christ . No one 's going to believe this . Because no one is gonna know . - What do you mean ? - Can you imagine the panic ? Look what 's happening already . People would freak out . - We have to say something . - No . We don 't have to say shit . Goddamn ! Look , if you really wanna end this , you have to help me get the box to the tower . Shit ! - Michael ! - Who 's this ? Michael , put the gun down . Abby ? - What the ... ? - Abby ! Michael , easy . Easy . This is crazy ! They destroyed the lab , will ! - You destroyed the goddamn ... - shut up ! - Shut the fuck up ! You cannot trust her , will . Don 't trust her . Reynard is waiting with what 's left of the team . We 're regrouping . No . No.I can 't - - The plan failed , will . Badly . - I know . Come with me , and we will fix this . Abby . No , Abby . I can 't . - We gotta go . - You have been identified . Lie on the ground and place your hands over your head . Hey ! It 's me ! What the fuck is wrong with you ? ! I 'll bring him in ... go ! Go ! Go ! Run ! We see you . Lie on the ground , and place your hands over your head . This is your last warning ! Alright ! No ! Let 's go ! Come on , get in ! Abby , let 's go ! Come on ! Ah ! Drive ! Come on ! Fuck you ! Fuck ! Goddamn you ! He 's coming in ! Give me the gun ! Shoot ! Come on ! Shoot him ! Argh ! Goddammit ! You out ? ! Are you out ? ! - It 's out ! It 's out ! - My pack ! Use the grenades ! Throw the grenade ! Throw the grenade ! Get to that bridge faster ! Faster ! Unmute . The disappearance is the latest in a line of recent reports of vehicles gone missing . A bizarre pattern which seems to be linked to abnormal weather behaviours surrounding the sites , according to some experts . Some skeptics believe the events are linked to the alterplex energy tower launched last week . - He wanted to wait up for you . - Yeah , I know . Sorry . We 'll get to it this weekend , I promise . They 're giving you weekends off now ? Mm . - And he gets a little homesick . - Yeah ? Well ... it 'll get better . And I swear I 'm gonna do something about all this ... Stuff . Okay ? You should get out and enjoy the city a bit . Have you taken him out on the canals yet ? We 'll be fine , will . Mm ... You okay ? - Bleeding . Shit . - It 's fine . It 's fine . You alright ? We have to bring you to Reynard . He 'll know what to do . - Reynard and his team just tried to put us in a coma ! - Because you attacked us ! - Will ? - They were aiming at me , Abby . Why ? You 're one of us ! Not anymore , Abby . Just get me into the tower . The tower . What are you going to do without the box ? ! They destroyed it ! Just trust me , I can fix this . He can fix it . But without Reynard and alterplex . Without them ! We 're getting in there , Abby . I can end this . Alright ? He can end it . Okay . Will ? Hi ! You 've reached Mia and Donny . We 're not here right now , so please leave a message after the ... Beep ... ! Mia , it 's me again . Please call me as soon as you can . Okay ? I love you . They evacuated . I made sure of it myself . Drone ! Drone ! Will ! Shhh . We have to move out of the open . Come . Safe . Let 's go ! We are not the military . We are an energy corporation . And the rebels ? They 're anarchists . That statement , given by alterplex ceo August Reynard , condemning the environmental group which attacked the facility ... If you find any water , take it . Which many officials viewed as highly controversial . News reports from the city are hard to verify due to the strictly enforced exclusion zone . Vehicles seemingly appearing out of thin air and dropping from the sky sound like ideas out of science fiction . Yet many eyewitnesses have reported these phenomena . The authorities are taking these accounts very seriously , prompting an official investigation ... Jesus Christ ... Oh , my god . Who moved these bodies here ? Oh , god ... Alterplex . Alterplex security , for sure . I 've seen similar sites . First we thought it was just a freak thing , but then they kept coming and coming . After a while , just gave up . I didn 't even know about this one . Too many bodies . That 's when I quit . I don 't blame you . On the other side ... is it like this ? No , just these vehicles went missing . That 's why alterplex sent me . So it 's not ... I-I 'm not ... Like I said , as far as I know , the other you is alive . I ... I don 't know . Jeez . You okay ? Shit ! This way , this way ! We 've got a drone ! - It spotted us ! - Ah , shit ! Let 's get in the plane ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Come on . Require ground support at grid two . Flyjack 21-b require ground support at grid two . Stay down . Stay down . We 're about to lay down suppressing fire . On red , shoot to kill . Repeat , shoot to kill . Visual on target ! Engage ! Let 's go ! You okay ? Okay ? Goddamn . Holy shit . We have to go . Go . Let 's go . Move ! They know where we are ! You okay ? We 're clear ! Whew . Goddammit . Drone ! Drone ! Face the drone and place your weapon on the ground ! Help me out , will ! Help me out ! Shit ! I 'm out . Sight your rifle , will ! Fire the charge ! Look out ! Oh ! No ! What 's it doing ? Ha . It 's working . Hey , Donny , you see that ? See that beam of light ? That is pure energy that is being sucked down into the tower . That 's gonna power the whole city here , maybe the whole country . - Sucking it from where ? - Well ... Will Porter , you are now on call . The group 's leader , Hugo romein , in an interview this morning , ensured that his movement will be monitoring the situation closely . Expressing grave concerns about the tower initiation , he went on to vow that his group would take action at the first sign of trouble , although he did not say what form that action would take . Will ... stay with me . Stay with me ! We gotta pull it out , okay ? We got to pull it out . There 's blood everywhere . Stop , stop ! He 'll bleed to death if you pull it out . There 's no way he 'll make it to the tower . We need to get him real help . Will , will , will , will . Stay with me . Wait , wait , wait . Wait . I know a place , just a few blocks from here . No , no , no . It 's me , it 's Michael . I got an injured man here . Carry him . You brought us here ? I had no choice , okay ? He 's bleeding to death . Weapons down , please . Weapons down . Come on ! - Are you awake , will ? - Where 's Hugo ? - Will ! Come on , all your weapons down . Hey , Hugo ! That 's not my problem . I 'd tell you , but we need the medic before he bleeds out . I 'm telling you . Hugo ! Stay here . Come on , leave her alone . - Don 't you fucking touch me ! - Shut up . She 's unarmed . Okay . Take ' em inside . Clear the table , come on . Sit down , will . Look out for your leg . Whoop . Please be careful with him . Is the muscle damaged ? Give him a shot of propofol and an iv of floxacillin . Okay , take his leg . Okay now , got his leg ? Alright . One , two ... - oh ! Ooh . It 's not working . We need to apply side pressure . Okay , try it again . Pull ! - Oh , it 's out . - Okay . Try to relax , will . Try to relax . Hand me the scissors ? Trust me , he 's gonna be okay . I 'll prepare the leg , make sure he doesn 't lose too much blood . We have to prepare the leg . On my count ... Gauze . Nurse , gauze , please . Couple of minutes , you 'll be as good as new . Who will stand up for her ? Who speaks for earth when multinationals exploit her resources for profit ? Who speaks for our planet when corporations rape her ... Mia ? - ... While pulling the wool over everyone 's eyes ? ! Mia , what are you watching this for ? We speak for her ... - Hey , what 's the matter ? - In the name of justice ! In the name of ... nothing , I 'm just ... I-I 'm fine . I 'm sorry . Donny wrote this today . The kids still teasing him in school ? It 's not the teasing , will . It 's this whole place , this ... this situation ... These ... things that are happening . You 've been so good to us , and you don 't owe us anything ... Mia ... - and I think maybe it 's time that ... No . Come on . I don 't want Donny and I to stand in the way of something that 's so important to you . Mia , if he misses home , we 'll go back on a trip . Let me go talk to him , okay ? - Hey . - Where am I ? How long have I been out ? Who are you ? No , we have to ... we have ... We don 't have a lot of time . What ... ? - Hey ! - Whoa ! Easy ! - Who are you ? - You have to let us go . We need to get out of here right now . You work for alterplex , just like her ? - You need to let us go now . - Tell him . Tell him . Yeah , tell me . Who do you work for ? What ? Come on , Michael . - Tell him . - Michael ? Michael , come on . We need to go , we need to get outta here . Who is this guy ? What are you doing ? ! No , no , no ... Don 't . What are you do ... Are you listening to me ? ! We have to go ! We have to get that thing to the tower ! - Redivider ? What is this ? - That 's impossible ! What is not possible ? What is this ? Come on . You bring these people in here and you can 't explain what this is ? ! - Hugo , he told me he can help . - Did you sell us out , Mike ? - No . I swear . - Did you sell us out ? ! No , I didn 't . Trust me , I know what I 'm doing . - Hey ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! - They can help . Hugo , trust me . They can help ? Help bring us this tracking device here ? Help us all get killed ? ! What is this ? ! Shit ! - Shit ! - Ah ! Where 's the box ? Will , we need the box ! Michael , come on , we gotta get outta here ! Let 's go , go , go , go ! Gotta move out ! Move out , guys ! Move ! Abby ! Move ! Will , come on ! This way ! It 's the only way out ! Michael , let 's go , let 's get the fuck out of here . Let 's get outta here . Abby , come on ! Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Come on , move it ! Attention . You are harbouring a wanted individual . You are in breach of the active alterplex security order . Shhh ! Stay down , stay down . Okay . Yeah , let 's do it . Go ! Go ! Go ! Abby , come on ! Clear ! This way ! Abby ! Abby ! I couldn 't tell you about the box ! I know an escape tunnel nearby ! Shit ! Let 's go ! Come on ! - Give me the box , will . - We gotta move ! We gotta move ! Come on ! Why are you standing there ? ! Come on ! Come on ! We gotta ' go down . Come on . Quick . Abby ? Abby ! What was I supposed to do ? Abby , what was I supposed to do ? I couldn 't tell you about the box once I knew I was in the echo ! You weren 't even supposed to be here ! Nobody was supposed to be alive here . Stop ! No , you stop ! Redivider ... What is redivider ? Huh ? What is it ? You sent me here . You ... sent me here . Now you tell me what is redivider . It 's a classified protocol . A last resort . When restoring balance is impossible ... the box disables one side altogether . It destroys the tower . And this universe . There 's only one option left . Redivider aborts ... one universe to ensure ... the other survives . Jesus Christ . This thing 's a goddamn kill switch . Hey , bud . I got your note . I miss home , too . Truth is , Donny ... I don 't really know where home is anymore . Will Porter , please call in as soon as possible . You know , Donny , there are a lot of ... Very important ... Very smart people in these towers . And they wanted uncle will ... To move halfway across the world ... move our home after it goes through ... To be part of a very special project . It 's something that could help a lot people , you know ? Maybe even change the world . I thought maybe I could help you and ... your mom too . And that 's a big responsibility . Maybe the biggest responsibility of my life . Will Porter , please call in as soon as possible . What ... ? Really ? This for me ? Thanks , man . So you sent me on a suicide mission ? I 'm tired of being fucked around , Abby ! I am done ! Where did my family go , huh ? Where are they , Abby ? Will , where are you going ? Oh , shit ! What 's happening ? ! Where are you going ? You said they evacuated , right ? Donny , my sister , they evacuated ? Will , this is a bad idea . - I am too close to home . - No , you 're not thinking clearly . This is a bad idea . It 's getting worse . Oh , my god ! Oh , my god ! It 's ... it 's like it 's coming apart at the seams ! What the ... ? ! Holy shit ! I gotta get to them ! Don 't go ! Please stay with us . Get out of my way ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Oh , my god ! Mia ? ! Mia ! Donny ! I should never have dragged you guys here . I am done . - Done ? - Yeah . I 've been so selfish . - We 're gonna get through this . - I don 't wanna just get through this , Mia . You and Donny deserve way better . Please , I didn 't mean for this to become a big thing . Mia , it 's a huge deal . You 're my sister . I promised to look after you . And I ... I don 't feel like I 've done a very good job . We 're going home . All of us . Are you sure ? First thing in the morning , I 'm going to quit and ... We 'll get on the first plane outta here . Okay ? Thank you . What kind of person are you ? ! You said they evacuated . You said you made sure of it yourself . You lied to me . What 's that ? What 's it doing ? I 'm sorry . Wait here . Shit ! What the hell is going on ? ! Critical failure protocol ! You 're going in ! Will ! I guess that resignation will have to wait . I 'm sorry . - Where are they taking you ? - Porter ! You have to go now ! What ? Will ! Will ! Traitor . We got Porter . What about the box ? Is it safe ? Ah ! - Yes , sir . - Good , good . Don 't let it out of your sight . What should I do with it ? - Just like we discussed . - Copy . Take them up front . Reynard . - Hello , will . - Whatever he says , don 't listen to him ! - On your knees ! Stay down ! - Don 't trust him . Jordan , let 's go . It 's an interesting ... strange ... beautiful paradox . Those two worlds conjoined , like twins ... just from the womb . We have to sacrifice one ... So the other may endure . - You 're going to sacrifice the original universe . - Hmm . You 're destroying my world so you can live ? Fuck you . We need your help , will . There is still time . Time for what ? You think I 'd actually help you ? With everything I know now ? I know ... This is a difficult decision . Difficult ? Difficult ? ! Killing my family is difficult ? ! That 's why going back is the only solution . You can see them again . You 're the only one who can pilot the jump . There is no third option . If we remain here in this stalemate , both worlds soon cease to exist . We have to sacrifice one to save the other . Yes . Yes , Mr. Porter , your family will die . I 'm only offering you the opportunity to be there . Hold their hands ... In the end . One must be sacrificed so the other can live . That works for me . Michael , hold onto something now ! Ah ! Ugh ! There . Where 's Portman ? Where 's the box ? Where is the box ? ! Shoot me ! Shoot me ! Ah ! Ah ! Take this . We gotta move . You know what I need to do , right ? - Exactly what you gotta do . - You know what this means ? Kill switch . That 's okay . I need to right some wrongs anyway . They 're still shooting ! Drive ! Drive ! Hold on ! - Michael ! - Shit . - You okay ? - Oh , shit , I 'm hit ! I 'm hit ! Stop the car ! Here , you take the wheel . Let 's go . Let 's go , move ! Will ! Will , are you okay ? ! Will ! Shit ! Shit , drones ! Shoot ! Shoot the nose ! Shoot the nose ! Shoot the nose ! It controls the other drones ! Come on , will ! Look . We 're almost there . Ah , shit ! You get to the tower and you end this ! You end this , will ! Truth is , Donny , they wanted uncle will to be part of a very special project . It 's something that could help a lot of people , you know ? Maybe even change the world . And I thought maybe I could help you ... and your mom , too . That 's a big responsibility . Maybe the biggest responsibility of my life . I don 't want Donny and I to stand in the way of something that 's so important to you . I 've been so selfish . You 've been so good to us , and you don 't owe us anything . And I think maybe it 's time ... If he misses home , we 'll go back on a trip . You 're my sister and I promised to look after you . And I ... I don 't feel like I 've done a very good job . We 're going home . All of us . I promise , I can fix this . I can 't let you do it , will . I 'm sorry . I can 't let you touch the box . This world is already dying . This cannot be the end . Do you realize what you 're doing ? Yes . I 'm keeping a promise . Oh , shit ! You 've killed us ! You 've killed us all ! Sonofabitch ! These are extraordinary times , and we face an extraordinary challenge . The dramatic achievement which occurred in recent weeks should 've made clear to us all the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take .

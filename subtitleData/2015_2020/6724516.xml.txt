 [ Tearing , growl ] [ Snarl ] [ Growl ] [ Clang ] [ Electronic distortion ] Ah ! Well ... Here we are . It 's not perfect , but what a deal , right ? Lots of potential . [ Door creaks , slams ] [ Glass shatters ] I know this is your house , now , hon , but you don 't have to slam the door and frighten me to death . I didn 't , it must 've been a draft . Really ? There shouldn 't be any windows open , that 's odd . Are you all right ? I ... I heard something break . Yeah , it 's quite all right . I 'm sorry about the broken glass , though . I can bring by a replacement if you need it . Um , no ... no ... No need for a replacement . Do you happen to know who that is in the picture ? No , I don 't . Sure was a handsome man , though , whoever he was . Too bad we 're probably 40 years too late to snag him . - [ Laughs ] - Probably so . I 'll be right back . I 'm going to see if I can find a broom and a dustpan . Found it . I 'm surprised to find a broom and a dustpan in this old place . Usually , I bring my own , but today my assistant took mine . [ Voice echoing ] She always does that , then texts me to tell me that she took it . Drama can come in any form , even in the form of a broom and a dustpan . [ Indistinct whispers ] - Did you hear what I said , hon ? - [ Gasps ] You scared me . Oh , I guess we 're even then . Boo ! [ Laughs ] Oh , I 'm just kidding , hon . You 're such a serious Sally . Lighten up , would ya ? You need to be all loosy , goosey and free as a bird . This is your house by the lake that you said you always wanted . Yes , it 's wonderful . I 'm very lucky . Oh , look at the time . I have an appointment in an hour , so I need to get going . Are you sure you 'll be all right out here all alone ? Yes , I 'll be fine . My movers get here at three .

( Ragtime music playing ) [ Music speed slowing down ] [ Door creaks ] [ Music speed playing normally ] [ Gasps ] Oh ! Well , hello . May I help you , little girl ? - I 've lost Mr. peppers . - Mr. peppers , who 's that ? He 's my kitten and we 're getting ready to go and I can 't find him . - Have you seen him ? - No . But I 'll keep a lookout for him . Would you like to come in and look for him yourself ? Why not ? Are you afraid ? Is it because I 'm a stranger ? What is it ? What do you see ? [ Cat meows ] [ Meow ] Oh , poor little guy . Oh , come here , little guy . - Come on , baby . - [ Meow ] Shh . It 's okay . Here , come here . Okay , buddy . Ow ! Ow . God . Ow . What was that ? Oh , come on , baby . Poor little guy . Mr. peppers ! You found him . Mr. peppers . Here you go . - [ Meow ] - I 'm so happy to see you . Thank you very much for finding Mr. peppers . [ Whispering ] You 're not alone . What ? - [ Woman ] Are you injured ? - Oh , um , I cut myself on a nail , I think it 'll be all right . May I help you , dear ? Um , thank you , but I can manage it . You know , it 's not wise for a single woman to live out here alone on lake eerie , and not associate kindly with her neighbors . Excuse me ? I said , it 's ... it 's not wise for a single woman - to live out here alone on lake eerie . - I heard what you said , and I 'm ... I 'm not meaning to be rude , it 's just ... I 'm not used to people wanting to help me . You know , I do apologize . I 've not been myself lately . Uh , let 's start over , shall we ? I 'm ... I 'm Kate ... oh . - Ooh . - So sorry . Let 's try the other hand . Well , my name 's Eliza . May I come inside ? I ... I ... I can help you bandage that cut . I don 't even think there are bandages inside , um , the house , or not . Eliza ? I know where he kept them . You know where he kept them ? Who kept what ? Harrison , and bandages . What ? Come on . Follow me , dear . Sit right over here , please . Oh , okay . Well , take off your pants too , please . [ Gasps ] I wonder if rubbing alcohol expires . [ Sniffs ] Woo ! [ Laughs ] [ Sniffs ] This has probably been here for 40 years , or so . I 'll be right back . How did you know that was under there , Eliza ? I knew the former owner of this house ... Very well . You did ? Was it that man in the photo there ? Yes . That was him . He was such a handsome young man , was he not ? I have lived by this lake since I was a little girl , and he and I were very good friends . His name was Harrison Perseus Lloyd . You know , I never thought anyone would ever move back into this house again . It 's been vacant since the summer of 1969 . - [ Winces ] - Ooh , I 'm so sorry , dear . What happened to him ... Harrison ? Well , he fell into a coma and died . How ? What happened ? No one knows . He was a great explorer and archaeologist . Oh , he loved history and artifacts . In fact , he was close to a grand discovery at the time of his sudden coma . My niece , she wrote a paper on him for Oxford university . Isn 't that something ? Oh , I 'm so proud of her . She 's such a sweet girl . Was he married ? No . No , he never married . Although , I think there was a special someone in his life . She was a very pretty young woman . [ Clears throat ] But she was quite independent , like you , Kate . - Like me ? - [ Laughs ] Yes . I know we 've just met , but anyone who moves way out here in a big house is definitely independent . Why did the house stay vacant for so long , and why did ... why didn 't Harrison 's family take his stuff ? Well , because in his will , Harrison requested that all of his belongings remain right here in the house . And that the house remain in his name . And then his cousin take care of it , while the bank account could afford to pay all the taxes . Well , and then they transferred the house to his cousin 's name and he kept care of it , until he died a few years ago . Since then , the house has been on the market and finally the county auction . And now you have come into the picture . Have you not ? So , where do you come from , Kate ? Iowa . My husband and I worked on my father 's farm there . Why 'd you leave ? Um , we always planned to retire here on lake eerie . My husband , John , he used to spend his summers as a boy with his grandma here . How lovely . Where 's your husband ? I 'm sorry . I don 't suppose that 's any of my business , is it ? Well , there you are . Good as new , I dare say . That 's perfect . Thank you very much . You know , my niece is coming for a visit in about a week , or so . She 'd love to take just a peek inside the house , if that would be all right with you , Kate ? Yeah . That would be fine . She ... she 's the one who wrote the paper on Harrison ? Yes , yes . Actually , she 's my sister 's granddaughter . Well , that would make her my ... Grand-niece , wouldn 't it ? [ Laughs ] Who says that ? This is terrific . I can 't wait to tell her . She 's a huge fan of Harrison . Look , I have got to go and take my medicine . You don 't want an old woman falling down dead in your house , do you ? [ Chuckles ] [ Giggles ] Do you know these men , Kate ? Yes , they 're my movers . Oh , of course they are . [ Chuckling ] [ Laughing ] [ Man ] Kate Ryan ? [ Kate ] Yes , that 's me . Hi . Um , we 're the movers . We have 20 boxes for you , is that correct ? - Yes , that 's correct . - And no furniture ? No , the house came furnished . - You need me to sign somewhere ? - Um ... oh , yes please . Here and here , if you would . Thank you very much . We 'll get started . Thank you . You guys almost done ? Hello ? [ Buzzing ] - [ Loud buzzing ] - Ah ! [ Clanking ] [ Indistinct whispers ] Oh ! [ Gasps ] You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . You seem frightened . I just thought I saw something in the other room there . I think the fan came on by itself . Typical woman , afraid of her own shadow . What did you say ? Nothing . Never mind . Are you guys almost done ? One more box and that 'll be it . - Okay , thanks . - Okay . [ Indistinct whispers ] May I help you ? Eliza , it 's me , Kate . Your new neighbor down the street . Who ? Kate . We met earlier . You bandaged my leg , when I cut myself . I fooled you . [ Cackles ] I was just playing a friendly joke . Of course I remember you , dear . I haven 't lost all my marbles yet . You need something ? I was wondering if I may use your phone . I suppose so . It 's an old phone and I rarely use it . I hope it works . Come on in , dear . Come in . Thank you . I won 't take long . Here you go , my dear . [ Dials phone ] [ Phone rings ] Hello . Pop , it 's me . I made it safe . Hey . It 's good to hear your voice so soon . So how do you like the place ? Um , it needs some work , but the views and location make everything worth it . Well , that 's good news . So , you didn 't make a mistake , then . Pop , do you think I made a mistake by leaving ? No , you 've been through a lot lately . And I 'm fine . Everything is fine . Yeah . Well , good . I just want you to be healthy , wealthy , and wise . Pop , I need to go . I 'm using a neighbor 's phone . What happened to your cell phone ? I don 't get reception up here . I don 't like the sound of that one bit . Pop , it 'll be fine . Listen , I gotta go . I 'll call you soon . Love you . You know , we 've been on the phone , like , less than a minute , and you already have to go ? Yes , but I 'll call you soon . I promise . - Pop ? - I 'm here . Yeah , I understand . How am I gonna get a hold of you ? I 'll set up my phone next week . But I gotta go . I 'll call you soon . - All right , good night . - Bye , pop . Good night . Good night . Thanks , Eliza . I really appreciate it . Oh , it 's not a problem , dear . Do you live up here alone , too ? Oh , no , I 'm not that crazy . I mean , not that you 're crazy . [ Nervous laugh ] I live with my sister . She 's upstairs asleep . Well , I 'll let myself out , if it 's all right . Good night , Eliza . Guess I 'll see you soon , Kate . Good night . Don 't let the bedbugs bite . [ Cackles ] [ Door opens , closes ] Ugh . Oh , god . Damn it . [ Sighs ] [ Electrical zap ] Oh , no . [ Groans ] Ugh . Great . You 've got to be kidding me . - [ Wind blows ] - Ugh . Well , I brought back up this time , little candle . [ Creaking ] [ Clock ticking ] [ Indistinct whispers ] [ Pounding on door ] Pounding [ pounding ] Good morning , dear . I made some muffins . I thought you might want a couple . Thank you . Please , come in . Thank you . [ Giggles ] Rough first night ? Yeah , a little rough . What happened , dear ? Um ... [ Clears throat ] Oh . So sorry about that . Ooh . Mm . You hungry ? I was so busy yesterday trying to get the house together , I didn 't eat much . Well , don 't choke trying to tell me about it . [ Eliza laughs ] However , I am curious as to why there was a big old knife by your side the first night . I thought I saw someone . Someone ? In the house ? I think my eyes were just playing tricks on me . I was upstairs closing a window , and I saw a man . I had a candle in my hand , and I couldn 't see very well . It was only for a split second . And then the candle blew out , and I ran downstairs to get a knife . [ Scoffs ] Well , why were you using candlelight , dear ? Oh , one of the lights blew a fuse , and I didn 't know where the fuse box was kept . Do you need to come down to my house and call an electrician ? Yeah , that 's a good idea . And if it 's not too much trouble , may I take a shower while I 'm there ? Oh , of course , dear . Oh , and Autumn , my niece , she 's ecstatic about coming to the house . She caught me this morning and I told her about you moving in and she screamed with excitement . She said she 'd be down this weekend , if not sooner . Why is she so excited about seeing inside the house again ? Well , Autumn spent years , you know , doing research on Harrison 's findings as an archaeologist . For her to be able to get into this house , and see if maybe there were some notes or artifacts that were left behind , oh , I 'm sure that would help her research greatly . Oh , but there are so many lovely things here . It 's like your own , private museum . If I didn 't have my sister to tend to , well , I 'd help you go through everything myself . That 's very kind , but I can manage on my own . Come . I have coffee at my house . You can call an electrician and get cleaned up . [ Taps on door ] Are you decent ? - Yes , Eliza . - [ Eliza laughs ] Come in . Well , bad news . The electrician called back and he won 't be able to come by - till tomorrow afternoon . - Really ? There 's no one else who could come today ? [ Laughing ] Oh , I 'm afraid not , dear . La Salle is a small community , and most people have left already for the winter . Everyone is leaving la Salle and headed home . You get here , and everybody leaves , I dare say . [ Cackles ] Well , that sounds like a bad omen for me . Well , I 'm not leaving , deary . That 's why my niece calls me , " one tough bird . " 'Cause I can manage through anything . Well , I need to learn that then . [ Eliza ] Is that your husband ? May I see , dear ? What 's his name again ? [ Crying ] John . [ Eliza ] Well , John ... Is a handsome man , I dare say . Well , I 'm off , dear . It 's almost lunchtime . And I have to tend to my sister . You sure you 're all right ? Yes , I 'm fine . Stop asking me that . Oh . I do apologize . Well , I 'll leave you to it then . [ Cries ] Hmm . What were you hiding ? [ Harrison 's voice ] " March 14th , 1957 , Edinburgh castle , Scotland . First archaeological survey traveling with Thomas gray , professor at Princeton , university . April 5th , 1965 . In Egypt . Found a locket in a tomb belonging to the daughter of a pharaoh . Her name was Anandi . Portions of the inscriptions in the tomb were damaged , and cannot be translated . However , the preserved inscription described a treacherous crime Anandi committed and her punishment required her to travel to another realm . Thomas gray believes the locket is known as ' the locket of light . ' the locket was shown to open portals to other dimensions . June 10th , 1969 ... I plan to go against Thomas ' warnings and perform the first experiment using a human test subject . I will perform experiment 19 on myself that mimics the procedures depicted in the hieroglyphics shown in Anandi 's tomb . Results to be determined . " [ Electrical surge ] - John ! - Kate . Why did you leave me ? I 'm here , my love . - Why did you leave ? - Shh . It 's all right . - Kate . - Yes ? I want you to do something for me . Anything . I brought someone for you to meet . And I brought her for you . I want you to ... Let me watch . Will you do that for me ? You know , it 's always been a fantasy for me . Come on . Will you , my love ?

And if you don 't want to let me in to fix your issue , I have no problem backing out of here , and going to the next job . Okay then . Come in . Thank you . Hallelujah . That 'll do her . You 're all set . Some bulbs need replacing and you may want to re-wire the house eventually . But you have electricity again . Take care . Thank you . [ Eliza ] Yoo-hoo ! Anyone home ? Eliza , you scared me . Oh , sorry , dear . You want me to go back out and knock ? [ Chuckles ] No , that 's all right . Come in . Oh . I 'm very impressed . Purple is my favorite color . Are you all right , dear ? You seem troubled . I haven 't been sleeping well . Oh , dear . You need to try and get some rest . I 'm going to bring you some chamomile tea so you can sleep tonight . Or whiskey , if you want to be out like a light . [ Laughs ] You know , I was thinking about going up to the store , in a little while , and get a few things . I may buy some chamomile tea . Yes , indeed . Chamomile tea makes me sleep like a baby bear in the wintertime . You know , I found Harrison 's journal in a drawer upstairs , and some sketches . Oh , what did you do with them , dear ? Oh , they 're still up there . It was a locked desk . I 'm sure Autumn will want to look through those . She should be here , uh ... Around three . Three , wow . Okay , that works , I guess . Oh , Autumn 's a lovely girl . You won 't even know she 's here . I cannot believe it . I am finally walking through the house of Harrison Perseus Lloyd . [ Gasps ] Oh god , I 'm so amazed that you get to live here , Kate . Uh ... Harrison must have been a great man . Oh , yes . He was a man truly ahead of his time . He had theories of ancient Egypt that I still cannot fully wrap my brain around . And he was only 29 at his death . Imagine what that man would have accomplished if he had only lived a full life . Wow , he was so young . His last exploration was in Egypt . And I have some theories , myself , on what may have happened to him . - [ Kate ] Really ? - Yes . His good friend and colleague Thomas gray wrote this article on him and his research . And the article references this artifact that Harrison found in a tomb . - [ Kate ] Was it a locket ? - Yes . How do you know about the locket ? I had found Harrison 's journal and some sketches of a locket upstairs . Where ? In the bedroom , on the desk . May I see them , please ? - Yeah , sure . - [ Squeals ] [ Laughing ] Well , that will keep her busy for a while . Didn 't you say you needed to go to the store for some things ? Yes , but I don 't want to leave her here alone . Oh , she can handle herself . She is very respectful of other people 's things . Especially Harrison 's . She 'll be fine . Well , okay . - How far is it again ? - Oh , it 's not far . Only about a mile or so to the Marina . Autumn ! Kate and I are gonna run to the Marina for some food . Okay ? Okay . Auntie Eliza , you should see it up here . It 's amazing . Can I stay the night ? Kate is nodding her head , so you are one lucky lady , I suppose . Thank you , Kate ! You 're welcome , Autumn . It 'll be nice to have some company here anyway . [ Waves crashing ] Found any good stuff ? Oh , my goodness , yes . I can 't believe all these notes and sketches have been hidden in this house all these years , and no one has been able to view them until now . - Where 's my aunt ? - Oh , she said she needed to get back to see about her sister . I told her you could borrow some clothes and anything else you may need while you 're here . Wow , that 's really nice of you . I can 't thank you enough , Kate . No , no problem . If you would just share the wealth if you find anything from Harrison , that 'd be nice . [ Laughs ] For sure . Well , this locket of light would be worth a pretty penny , indeed . So , what does this locket do , anyway ? I 'm not totally sure . It 'd be nice if we could find it . You haven 't come across it by any chance , have you ? No , not yet . Harrison believed it would be worth more than just money . Harrison believed it would open portals to other dimensions . And if that 's the case and we find it , I 'm pretty certain that would change everything for the pioneers in those research fields . Do you have any theories about the locket and Anandi ? You know about Anandi ? The Egyptian Princess ? I read some of Harrison 's journal and I caught on to some of the storyline , but the jargon was pretty much over my head . Well , to answer your question , yes , I do have a theory . I think the locket , or the " locket of light " as some would like to call it , sent the spirit to a purgatory-like place , for all eternity . What did Anandi do that would make them want to punish her in this way ? Them ? No , no , it was her father who wanted to punish her in this way . The pharaoh . He was a really stubborn leader . He demanded perfection in everything , and Anandi fell in love with a thief who raided the tomb of the pharaoh 's mother . And basically used Anandi to get what he wanted . And when Anandi wouldn 't give up the thief 's name , the pharaoh was so angered by this , he lost his mind . The tombs report that the pharaoh went to the Heka priest for a fitting punishment . Heka , is black magic used against the gods . Real evil stuff . Anyway , the hieroglyphics that I studied showed the creation of the locket of light by the Heka priest . And the pharaoh using it to send his daughter to the prison realm for all eternity . The pharaoh was depicted as going mad shortly after , which makes me believe that he truly loved Anandi . But he was just too stubborn to forgive her . Well , if he sends her to this place , this prison , isn 't there a way he can bring her back if he changed his mind ? [ Sighs heavily ] Just by my research , the locket of light is depicted as a device , so I 'm thinking my answer would be yes . Especially considering the hieroglyphics showed that Anandi didn 't die right away . - What ? - Yep . The holy men that buried her said that she was buried alive , that , " her cheeks were red with life . " Whoa . And then Harrison found her tomb . Yep . And apparently the locket , too . Did you read the last entry of Harrison 's journal ? No , I haven 't . [ Sighs ] " I will perform experiment 19 on myself that mimics the procedure depicted in the hieroglyphics found in Anandi 's tomb . Results to be determined . " - Holy shit , Kate . - That 's not suggesting that the locket had something to do with his death , is it ? [ Sighs ] No . He didn 't have the ending hieroglyphics to know how the locket functions . I bet he believed that the locket would stay on his physical body , and he would be able to get back that way . [ Sighs ] I don 't know what he was thinking . But we , or ... Pioneers in exploration , rather get caught up in the excitement of the discovery ... And foolish mistakes can be made . Are you saying that Harrison accidentally killed himself , and is now stuck in a hell-like prison ? Listen , Kate , I 'll keep looking through the notes and see what else I can find . Maybe it 's all a coincidence and he was one of those unlucky people that fell into a coma . But don 't worry , I 'll figure it out . I 'm sorry . How about some tea ? Excuse me ? Would you like some tea ? Yes , please . Still working ? Yes . I 'm finding some great things in his notes . He 's such a fascinating man . I can almost hear his voice through his writing . [ Giggles ] That probably sounds silly , but , god ... I wish I could have known him . It doesn 't sound silly . [ Electricity surging ] I feel like I 'm intruding in on his home . I can see his face everywhere . And what beautiful eyes he had , too . You can 't really tell in these black and whites , but I wonder what color they were . If I didn 't know any better , I 'd say you have a crush on Harrison Lloyd . Ah , well , I 'm amazed by him in almost every way . He gave to charities , and he donated his artifacts . He wasn 't one of those selfish archaeologists . He was a brilliant painter . Did you see the murals above the garage ? My aunt says it 's extraordinary . You 're a painter , right ? You two have something in common , then . I haven 't seen over the garage yet , but I 'll do that tomorrow , for sure . Um , and I made a bed for you upstairs , but you 're welcome to sleep anywhere you feel comfortable , and there 's some comfy clothes on the couch over there . Thank you , Kate . I feel as though I have known you forever already . Yeah , me too . It 's nice to have you here . Well , good night then . Good night .

Even those boots look good on you , city boy . [ Chuckles ] Think so ? Yep . [ Giggles ] Hey , Kate . Thank you for loving me . Don 't mention it . - [ Kate screaming ] No ! - [ Firefighter ] Hey , hey , relax ... - No ! - We 'll take care of it , Kate . John ! [ Gasps ] John !

You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies . [ Together ] You anoint my head with oil , my cup overflows . Surely , goodness and mercy shall follow me - all of the days of my life - all of the days of my life . Is someone there ? Answer if you can hear me . I could hear you praying with me just now . I haven 't heard the voice of a woman in so long . Please , speak again if someone is there . - Hello ? - Yes , there you are again . You sound like an angel . Who are you ? - My name is Harrison . - Harrison ? Yes . I don 't know how we are able to make contact like this , but it may not last long . Please , listen to me carefully . You must find a locket . It is in a room over the garage of my house in la Salle , Michigan , do you know where that is ? Yes , I 'm in the house . I know who you are , Harrison . Who are you ? Kate . My name 's Kate . - Kate ? - Yes ? I don 't have much time . Please , go to the room over the garage . The locket possibly fell near the window . That locket is the way that I got here , therefore , it must be the way out . Are you in the house ? It is a different realm , but it is linked to my house , the same as they are . Who are they ? They are the guardians of this place . They exist to torture lost souls who are trapped here . There is only darkness . [ Cries ] There 's no light at all ? There is a light out in the distance , past the dark water , but there 's no way to get to it . You need to get out of the house , Kate . They are linked to the house through me . - [ Radio cutting out ] - [ Kate ] Oh , my god . [ Rumbling , crackling ] Kate , they 're here . Get out . Kate , no ! Harrison ? - [ Static ] - Harrison ? Harrison ? - [ Sports announcer on radio ] - Oh , no . Harrison . [ Radio ] 25 , 20 , 25 , 10 , 5 . Touchdown ! Harrison , can you hear me ? - [ Radio buzzing ] - [ Gasping ] Harrison . Autumn . Autumn ? [ Rattles ] [ Banging ] Kate ? - Pop ? - Hi . What are you doing here ? What the hell are you doing ? I 'm looking for something . Looking for something ? What were you looking for ? It 's hard to explain . What are you doing here anyhow ? Well , I got worried about you , so I tried calling and ... [ coughs ] I just thought I 'd come up and check on you . It 's a quick 11-hour drive . - 11 hours ? - Yeah . Man , you must have left early this morning , then . I did . Can I trouble you for a cup of coffee ? Yeah . Yeah , I think I got some . Here , wait . Wait a second . Watch it . Watch it . - You got a bunch of nails . - Yeah . I think I got some coffee in the house . You know that Asian soybean rust was just a bunch of crap . It just made the leaves look bad . It 's the herbicide resistant weeds that 's breaking our backs . We know what it looks like . We 're just gonna break even again this year , and I 'm about ready to pack it in , my heart is just not as strong as it used to be . What the hell are you doing here ? I mean , there 's papers everywhere and furniture tipped over , and you 're tearing up boards . What am I supposed to think ? I mean , I ... Are you taking your medicine ? - Pop , I 'm taking my ... - Are you taking your pills ? I 'm taking my pills . I 'm not crazy , if that 's what you 're thinking . I know you 've been through a traumatic experience . You living in this house , this old house , all alone , you sure making an old man worry . Are you staying a while ? No . I 'm leaving in the morning . And I would like you to come back with me . - Pop , I can 't leave him . - What ? Leave him ... who ? John ? No , Harrison . Thank god , who the hell 's Harrison ? Harrison ... He 's stuck in this house , Autumn and Eliza were explaining everything to me , and Autumn was trying to figure it out last night . And then I heard his voice over the radio , - and I could communicate with him . - Aw , sweetheart . You have to believe me , pop . He 's in this house . Oh , sweetheart , listen to me . Listen to me . You 've got to stop punishing yourself . Are you talking about John , now ? Is that who you want to talk about ? Can you ... Can you listen to yourself ? Do you know what you just said ? Some guys trapped in a radio , and he 's talking to you . And who the hell is Autumn and Eliza , by the way ? Eliza lives down the street , and Autumn is her niece . I thought you said that people don 't live here in the winter , that you 'd have to be crazy to live here in the winter . So you do think I 'm crazy ? I think you 're having a breakdown , sweetheart . I really do . That 's why I want you to come home with me , it 's a safe place . You can get all the treatment you need . Do you want to meet him ? Well , hell yes , if they 're real , I 'd like to meet them . - Now ? - Now . Let 's go . Eliza ! It 's me , Kate . Eliza ! [ Knocking ] Eliza . Come on , honey . You 're embarrassing yourself . Everybody 's gone for the winter . Eliza ! Come on . Come on , it 's cold . Pop , this is the house . I know it is . This is the ... I was just here . And the boards weren 't there . [ Sighs ] This is all real , pop . Yeah ? Yeah , we all yearn for something real . Especially when we 're hurting inside . - [ Rattling ] - Here you go , Kate . Hah . Here you go , honey . Why don 't we call it a night ? I 've got the couch . All right ? Pop ? Yeah ? Will you just leave it all as it is ? - Sure . - Will you just do that for me , please ? Yeah . - Night , bunny . - Night , pop . [ Male spirit ] Kate . Kate . Kate . - Harrison ? - [ Harrison ] Please , come down . Oh . [ Chuckles nervously ] It 's nice to meet you , Kate . Am I dreaming ? Yes . Yes , you are . But you 're real , right ? I 'm not crazy ? You 're not crazy , but this is a dream . It 's the only way I could see you . [ Thunderclap overhead ] What 's happening ? What 's wrong ? They 're planning a way to kill you , Kate , and they 're building their strength to actually do it . What ? The longer you stay here , the weaker you will become . They can invade your thoughts , and your dreams , it 's not safe for you here . Why do you they want to kill me ? Because they know you 're a threat . They exist to keep me in this place , do you understand ? [ Thunder cracks ] Walk with me . They 're here . They can hear us now . I 'm frightened . It 's too late now . I need you to wake up . Kate , wake up ! I need you to wake up ! Wake up ! [ Crying ] Pop , how could you do that to me ? How could you do that to me , pop ? Listen , I know I crossed the line a little bit , but what I was doing was what 's good for you . - What 's good for me ? - Yeah . [ Sighs ] Can you bring back my husband while you 're at it ? No , I cannot . If it 's not too much trouble , since you think you can turn water into wine and sand into grain , and make everything as right as rain . Can you make it so we have those grandkids you always wanted , too ? No , I can 't , honey . Is that asking too much ? - [ Cries ] - Oh . Listen , this is my final plea , honey . If you refuse to come back home , and get the treatment you need , then I ... I know I 've done everything in my power to help you , and I have to surrender , honey . Just go home , pop . I 'm staying here . [ Keys jingle ] These are yours . You know , the only reason they 're ever gonna remember me is because of you . Bye . [ Sniffles ] Bye , bye , bunny . [ Screams ] [ Whispers ] Kate ! Kate ! [ Crying ] [ Door creaks ] [ Crying ] Kate ? Autumn . [ Autumn ] Kate ? - Autumn ? - Oh , Kate . What happened ? I went to Eliza 's and no one was home . Oh my god , Kate , it 's real . This is the house that encompasses where Harrison is . I got attacked by one of them . - What ? - I was so scared and confused , I left . I went into town to find answers , so I called my professor . Are you all right ? What was it ? I 'm okay . The thing that attacked me , Kate , scratched my face and my chest while it was strangling me . And then it 's grip weakened and I fell on the floor . Oh ! - [ Kate whimpers ] - I 'm okay . I 'm all right . Autumn , what happened to Eliza ? Right . She had to take my grandmother to the hospital , she left me a message while I was in town . So I went to the hospital to check in on them and I got bandaged up , and I came straight back here to tell you what I found out . I feel like I 'm losing my mind , Autumn . Is this really happening ? [ Floorboards creaking ] - Oh my god ! - Let 's get out of the house and talk . You 're not crazy , Kate . I thought I was losing it there for a moment too , but I know I didn 't put these scratches on myself . Well , what do we do now ? My professor called me last night . He told me a story depicted in the hieroglyphics that shows a silver cord that connects our spiritual being to our physical body , and apparently the silver cord leads us into the afterlife after we die . A silver cord ? Yes . A consciousness thread . It links our spiritual being to our physical body and our spiritual being to the afterlife . It 's also known as a life thread by the Egyptians . And the hieroglyphics show the in-between realm as a midway point , that prevents the spirits from going into the afterlife . So in layman 's terms ... Basically , it 's like a prison that 's guarded by this malicious entities . Yeah , Harrison said something about them . Wait a minute . Did you just say , " Harrison said something " ? Yes . It sounds completely nuts . But I turned the radio on to try to comfort myself after a bad dream and I heard someone praying . - Praying ? - Yes . And I thought it was a late night radio announcer . So I started praying along with him . It ended up being Harrison and he could hear me , and we could somehow communicate through the radio . Fascinating ! This is amazing stuff , Kate ! Groundbreaking for my research . Not to mention , I 'm crazy jealous you got to speak to Harrison Lloyd . [ Laughs ] I 'm just glad you don 't think I 'm crazy . Look at this bandage , Kate . I know you 're not crazy . Thank you , Autumn . I don 't know what I would have done if you weren 't here . - Okay . - Okay , let 's get back to what I found out . My professor has a theory about water . - Water ? - Yes . This diagram is the only one my professor found that shows a glimpse of the realm where Harrison is . This diagram was buried with a Heka priest . This is the path to the realm of the gods . This middle one is where Harrison is . My professor believed these to be doors , or gates . This text translates into this . " For the worthy few , the doors of heaven open by the water for thee . The doors of the cool place open to the light . Thou shall find the water of life . Drink as a god among the eternals on the imperishable star . " Do you understand that ? Oh ! There 's more . Okay . Okay . Mm , the old testament , my professor found the book of Ecclesiastes , 12 : 6-7 . " If the silver cord be lost , follow the light to the cistern and drink the waters of the afterlife . Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was . And the spared shall return onto god who gave it . " Light ! Harrison said he could see a light . That 's the way out , that 's how he can escape . We have to tell Harrison . [ Radio crackling ] It 's worth a try I guess . Harrison ? Can you hear me ? Harrison ? Harrison ? We don 't have much time , Kate . The radio is no use . My professor suggested contacting Harrison in a different way . How ? We cause a diversion . A diversion ? What kind of diversion ? With you , Kate . With me ? I know this sounds crazy . But my professor studied thousands of hieroglyphics and he says the locket of light can bring a soul back into its body in a certain amount of time . What are you talking about , Autumn ? I 'm talking about you going to the in-between realm to cause a diversion to help Harrison escape . That is totally insane . You want me to go to a hell like place on a hunch and a theory by your professor ? Have you fucking lost your mind ? Kate . Have you ever lost someone close to you ? And if you could go back and change the past , would you ? Would you save him ? I know you can do this , Kate . You really think so ? Come on , Kate . This is a once in a lifetime thrill ride ! You can save him ! Okay . I 'll do it . [ Laughs ] You 're the bravest woman I know ! And you say you can bring me back ? According to Harrison 's notes and my professor 's theory , yes . I can bring you back . Well , what are we waiting for ? Harrison told me where it may be . Then lead the way ! He said it may have fell off by a window . [ Rustling ] [ Kate ] Autumn ? Oh , Kate . It 's beautiful . I know what to do . Follow me . This is what activates it . And then the legs wrap around like this , and ... Will it be painful ? I 'm not sure . I hope not . How will I get back ? This is the other lever that will bring your spirit back into your body . Well , the depictions on the tomb show the Heka priest performing this . And according to that we have 24 hours until the silver cord , or life thread , will be severed from your physical body . I cannot believe I 'm actually gonna do this . How do you know 24 hours ? Just trust me , Kate . You 're gonna be all right . If you 're gonna do this , just trust me . I will set the clock for 23 hours and 45 minutes , and then I will hit the button and pull you back . And how will I know if Harrison gets to the light and drinks the water ? It will be a bright flash of light . Unmistakable . And then I just wait for you to bring me back ? Just get in and help Harrison find the door by the dark water . And remember to tell him to go through the door and find the fountain and drink from it . And I will do the rest . Why don 't you do it , Autumn ? You know more about this stuff than I do . And I 'm gonna get in there and I 'm gonna panic and I 'm gonna forget what I 'm supposed to do . Kate , you 're gonna be all right . And I 'm gonna do everything I can to get you back safely . Wouldn 't you want someone to save you from a place like that ? When do we do this ? - Now . - Now ? Why now ? We can 't let Harrison be in a place like that for another minute . Come sit on the sofa , please . [ Sighs ] I can 't believe I just met you , and now I 'm trusting you with my eternal soul . I won 't let you down , Kate . You just focus on Harrison . Do whatever you need to do to save him . [ Metallic buzzing ] Are you ready ? [ Sighs ] Good luck . [ Groans ] [ Faint maniacal laughter ] [ Faint laughter continues ] [ Scratching ] Maniacal laughter ] [ Snarling ] [ Laughs ] [ Slurping ] [ Laughs ] [ Growls ] [ Snarling ] [ Growls ] What the hell are you doing here , Kate ? Have you lost your mind ? Do you know what you have done ? I came here to save you . That 's the thing . You cannot save me . Now you 've condemned yourself . The door . You must get to the door by the lake . That will take you to the light . There 's no way , that door 's guarded by them , always . How safe are we in this closet ? We 're not . We need to move in a few minutes . They don 't know you 're here yet , but it won 't take them long to figure it out . What will they do if they find me here ? It 'll be like Christmas morning for them . They will tear you apart . And jackhammer , the one you just witnessed carving that woman 's face off , will cut holes all over your body for fun just because he thinks it looks pretty . Who was that woman , is she dead ? She 's a lost soul , like me . Now you . We are immortal in this place , but we feel pain and agony . Our bodies are regenerative so we can be torn apart again , and again . Look , we don 't have time . The plan is that I will distract them ... Listen , and you 'll have a brief moment to make it to the door , find the light , drink from the water , and go on your way . That 's your plan , Kate ? There 's seven of them . Yes , and you said when they find me , they 'll want to take turns playing with their new toy , right ? Shh . [ Growling ] [ Groaning ] - [ Man screams ] - [ Woman laughs ] [ Bludgeoning ] [ Man screaming ] [ Growls ] [ Panting ] I believe you 've met the countess . Why do I smell sulfur ? It 's them . And I 'm so thirsty . Yes . And it gets worse with time . And just when you think it can 't get any worse , it starts all over again . How have you not lost your mind ? I don 't know . Because I 've never totally lost hope . I don 't know how I 'm gonna make it 24 hours . What do you mean , 24 hours ? Autumn says she 'll bring me back in 24 hours . Kate , time 's not linear here . We need to exert if we 're gonna give this plan of yours a go . [ Panting ] I still cannot believe you 're here , risking your life for me . I couldn 't save my husband , as god as my witness , I can save you . Enjoy your castle in the sky Harrison Perseus Lloyd . Don 't forget me . Go ! Run ! Now ! [ Kate screams ] Hurry up ! [ Screams ] [ Creaking ] [ Wind whistling ] Yahh ! [ Growls ] [ Sizzles ] [ Growling ] Thank you , Kate . He did it ! He made it ! [ Screams ] [ Panting ] [ Whimpering ] - [ Snarling ] - [ Whimpering ] [ Screaming ] No ! [ Crying ] [ Screaming ] [ Scratching ] [ Whimpers ] [ Snarling ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Maniacal laughter ] [ Maniacal laughter ] [ Gasps ] - Kate ? Is that you ? - [ Panting ] Please god , let it be you . Autumn ! [ Buzzes ] Oh ! Yeah , let 's take that off , shall we ? This may hurt a little . - [ Groans ] - Sorry . I 'm fine . Autumn , we have to destroy the locket . Destroy it ? That would be detrimental for my research . Autumn , we have to destroy it ! [ Panting ] So what happened ? What was Harrison like ? Oh , he was just as we both pictured he 'd be . He finally made it to his castle in the sky . Wow . I can 't believe we pulled it off . You have to tell me everything . Thirsty ? Oh , yeah . You have no idea . And I 'm so tired , too . Well , get some sleep . And you 're gonna figure out how to dispose of the locket , right ? Yep , sounds good . Oh , and Autumn . Yes ? Harrison 's eyes were blue . Hello , Kate . - This must be a dream . - You are correct . What do I owe this honor of seeing you so soon , Mr. Lloyd ? I wanted to give you a thank you gift - for saving me . - Oh , really ? Did you bring me roses from heaven ? No . Something better . John ! I thought I 'd never see you again . I 'm here , my love . John , I 'm so sorry . It was all my fault . No , Kate . It wasn 't your fault . It was just my time . - Oh , John . - I love you , Kate . This is only the beginning . A little taste of heaven , Kate .

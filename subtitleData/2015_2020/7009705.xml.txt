 Previously on The Handmaid 's Tale ... A fine and healthy girl . Do you have a name ? Angela . Angela . She 's just perfect . You can join us . What do you mean , " us " ? There 's a network . Waterford is important . He 's very high up . You need to be careful . With her ... Ofglen . She 's my partner . We shop together . Don 't get too close to her . It 's dangerous . Trusting anyone is dangerous . Especially a carpet  munching gender traitor . I 'd like to play a game with you . - A game ? - Yes . Then we 'll have to have a rematch . I 'm out of town next week , but when I get back ? Ofglen . I can tell her that the Commander is going to Washington . Fuck . I 've heard pieces of the story from Rita . The Marthas have their own networks . There was a black van . Then footsteps on the stairs . Then something quick and brutal that made her unable to scream . There 'd be no mercies for a member of the Resistance . She left nothing behind . No footprints . No breadcrumbs . I didn 't even know her name . Ofglen is gone . Now I 'm awake to the world . I was asleep before . That 's how we let it happen . When they slaughtered Congress , we didn 't wake up . When they blamed terrorists and suspended the Constitution , we didn 't wake up then either . They said it would be temporary . Nothing changes instantaneously . In a gradually heating bathtub you 'd be boiled to death before you knew it . Stop . Jeez . You want to kill me . Good for you . Good for ... Look . It 's not good for me . Red wine is good for me . Odette told me if you get any fatter , she 's gonna kick you out . She did not . Yeah , she said that . No , she didn 't . She did . No , give me a cap . Hey . Can I get a medium drip with a shot and a tall non  fat cap . Medium and a small . Yes . 7.81 . Is Claire sick ? Who ? The woman who usually works here . How would I know ? Sorry . Declined . Really ? Yeah . Insufficient funds . That 's not possible . I just deposited my paycheck yesterday , so ... Do you have any cash ? What ? No , what 's up ? Can you just run it again ? Could you come back when you have some money ? Excuse ... Hey , man , what 's your problem ? Just run her card again . I 'll just call from work . What 's your problem ? What ? Fucking sluts . Get the fuck out of here . What did you just say ? Excuse me ? Did you just call us fucking sluts ? Are you serious , dude ? This your first day or something ? What 's your name ? Unbelievable . What 's your name , bro ? Get out of here . Come on . Let 's go . Let 's go . Come on . He 's not worth it . Go . No , your coffee fucking sucks ass . What 's your problem , man ? Fucker . Thank you for your patience . Due to unexpectedly high call volume , we are experiencing longer than average wait times . If you would like to continue to hold , please press or say " One . " One . Thank you . A customer care representative will be with you shortly . Frickin ' liars . Roger called a meeting . Do you know who these guys are ? Are they with Building Security or something ? I don 't know . I don 't think so . What 's this meeting about ? I have no idea . Folks . Ladies and gentlemen . Folks , may I have your attention , please . Ladies , you should all know that I feel really sorry about this . Shit . It isn 't my decision . I don 't have a choice . - I have to let you go . - What ? I have to let you all go . Wait , we 're being fired ? No , no , not fired . No . Let go . What does that even mean ? You can 't work here anymore . It 's the law now . Roger , what law ? I don 't have a choice . They gave me 10 minutes . Please , just , just pack up your things . Hey , why is it just the women ? I don 't have a choice . Roger , Roger ! Thank you . Under His eye . Excuse me ? Why 'd they send the army ? I don 't think that 's the army . I think it 's another kind of army . No . No , no , no , no . I 'll take that . I 've got your lunch all ready . Go ahead , sit . It 's good . I have stewed apples for dessert . Do you like stewed apples ? Thank you . You are welcome . I even found some cinnamon . I swapped for it . I gave her a lot of cheese . It 's nice . I don 't want to forget this . Fuck . A rose is a rose , except here . Here it has to mean something . It 's beautiful . Mrs. Waterford cut it special . She picked it for me ? For good luck , I 'm sure . We 're all so hopeful . Hopeful ? You haven 't asked for your napkins yet this month . And I know you 're just a few days late , but a baby ? Wouldn 't it be wonderful ? Blessed day , Offred . How was your walk ? Very pleasant , thank you . How do you feel ? I 'm ... I 'm fine . You 're not nauseous ? Are your breasts tender at all ? No , not that I 've noticed . It 'd be too early for any of that . Yeah . Is the Putnam 's cake ready ? Yes , ma 'am . I just need to wrap it up . Well , it isn 't ready then , is it ? No , ma 'am . I 'm going to have a visit with baby Angela today . Would you like to come along ? It would be nice to have a change of scenery , don 't you think ? Yes , I ... I 'd like that very much , Mrs. Waterford . Good . Well , I 'll get myself cleaned up . You finish your lunch . Every bite , now . You need to be in the clean  plate club . She 's such an angel . She 's already gained two pounds . It 's very important . You look really comfortable like that , Serena . Offred ... Would you like to hold her ? Here she is . Do you think that 's a good idea ? Offred knows . She 's done it before . Isn 't she beautiful ? Hello . - If you don 't mind . - Of course . There we go . Yes , let 's get you over here . I 'm sorry , I 'm sure you 're all starving . We 've just been enjoying our time with your beautiful baby . Put the cookies on the table . She 's enjoyable now . But ... In the middle of the night , not so much . I don 't think I 'd survive without my coffee . What happened to your hand ? It 's nothing . Just one of those things . Angela had finished her breakfast , and I was picking her up . And that girl , that ungrateful girl , she snapped at me . She bit you ?  . You know how they get . I 'm just counting the days until Angela 's weaned and that girl is out of my house . - Hi ! - Hey . Did you see my baby ? Isn 't she beautiful ? She 's so beautiful . Yeah . Yeah . How are you doing ? I was ... I was so worried that she would look like her father . Caleb looked like his father . But she does ... She looks ... She looks like me . Yeah .  Janine , did you ... Did you bite Mrs. Putnam ? You can 't do that . Well , she is a cunt . Well , you can 't ... No , you don 't understand . She is always grabbing Charlotte . She 's always just grabbing at her . And I told her I was still feeding her , she wasn 't done eating , and she just grabbed her from me . Charlotte ? Yeah . That 's her real name . Janine , you cannot bite people . Can I tell you a secret ? I can do anything I want . I can . I had a baby . A good one ! I had a good one ! And so they don 't care . I can do anything I want . I can have ice cream . It 's only vanilla , but I can have it . Would you like some ? Sure . I would love some ice cream . Yes ! Yay ! Okay ! Let 's go , let 's go . Can I tell you another secret ?  . Um ... You can 't tell anyone , okay ? Okay . Okay . He ... He loves me . He loves me so much . Who ? Him . My Commander . He loves you ? Yes ! He loves me and he loves Charlotte . And ... We are going to run away together . He said that ? You don 't have to believe me . But , yes , he loves me . We 're going ... We 're gonna be a real family . Ice cream ! Let 's go . Car 's on its way , ma 'am . Thank you . We 'll wait . Did you have fun ? Yes . Thank you . Did you get a chance to visit with your friend ? I 'm sorry . I should 've asked permission . It 's fine . I imagine you two have a lot to talk about these days . Did Ofwarren seem well ? Yes . But I 'm afraid she might be losing touch . Well , that can happen sometimes ... With the weaker girls . You know , what you do , what we do together is so terrible ... It 's terribly hard , and we must remain strong . Which is why I feel so blessed to have you . Why don 't you go on and tell Nick I 'll have Mrs. Putnam 's driver take me home . I think Naomi could use some help . Yes , Mrs. Waterford . Have you seen the Putnam 's baby ? She 's really cute . I love fat babies . Do you know Ofglen 's gone ? You said she was dangerous . What 'd you mean ? You need to remember a few things . You can 't change anything about this . It 's gonna end the same no matter what you do , so there 's no point trying to be tough or brave . Brave isn 't part of any of this . Everybody breaks . Everybody . Nick . What is this ? Tell them everything . Nick . Whatever they want to know , just tell them . I couldn 't stop them . I 'm sorry . Okay , I 'll call Morgan ... - And you try the office again . - I 'll call now . Okay . Come home soon . I love you . Love you too . It sounds like they just froze any account with an " F " on it instead of an " M. " I have $ 4,000 in that account . They can 't just take it . Made it easy . All they needed to do was just push a few buttons . Alyssa heard there 's a new law . Women can 't own property anymore . Wait , what ? Are you fucking serious ? Luke can use your account . They 'll transfer the money to him , or that 's what they 're saying . Husband or male next of kin . You know , they needed to do it this way . All the bank accounts and the jobs all at the same time . Can you imagine the airports otherwise ? They don 't want us leaving . You can bet on that . They can 't just do this . They can 't . They can . We 've been under martial law since D. C. Yeah , but that was about preventing another attack . And it was about , you know , capturing terrorists . Maybe there were never any terrorists . Three books but she 's down . Hey , look , here 's the fucking problem . Did we find out anything ? Not much . There 's a law . Well , we found out we 're boned . Big surprise . I should get going . We 're pulling together a march for Thursday morning . We 'll figure it out . This can 't last . Hey , you have all my money now . So , congratulations . Come on . You know I 'll take care of you . Christ . Well , that 's not what he 's saying . What ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's just ... What ? It sounds a little patronizing . It is so fucking patronizing . Let 's go . Bring it on . I wanna hear why I shouldn 't take care of my wife . " My wife " ? Yeah . She doesn 't belong to you . That 's right . Yeah . No , no , no . She isn 't your property . And she doesn 't need you to take care of her . See , that 's where all of this comes from . You want to take care of us ' cause we 're weak , right ? 'Cause we 're less than . That 's exactly ... It 's exactly what I 'm saying . I 'll take care of your money . Yeah . I 'll take care of your body . You really got a fucking problem , you know that ? Should I just go in the kitchen and cut my dick off ? No , you should do that . And while you do it , take a video of it , 'cause the girls down at the collective will love watching that shit . They 'll love it . It 's not for the collective . It 's for you . You know that . Hey , Davis is closed . You 're gonna have to take the train at Alewife . Shit . You want me to walk you to the station ? Fuck , yeah . It 's crazy out there . Thanks , big , strong man . Thank you . Big , strong fuck . Please , God , I don 't want pain . I don 't want to be a doll , hung on the wall . I want to keep on living . I 'll do anything . Resign my body freely to the uses of others . I 'll sacrifice . I 'll repent . I 'll abdicate . I 'll renounce ... I find these conversations are much more efficient if we are all on the same page from the start . Eyes up . Good . Offred , if you do your best to answer these questions , this 'll all be really painless . All right ? Yes , sir . Good . That 's what we all want . Ofglen is your shopping partner , correct ? Yes , sir . And you walked with the previous Handmaid assigned to that house ? Yes . You walked together every day ? Yes . And what sorts of things would you and Ofglen talk about ? We talked about our shopping . We talked about the weather . You always walked directly to town and then directly home ? Yes . Sometimes we would stop at the wall to pray . Did you ever take the long way home , walk by the river ? It 's pretty by the river . Yeah . It 's nice . It 's peaceful . Private . What did you talk about when you walked by the river ? Shopping . And the weather . Shopping and the weather . Nothing else ? Nothing that I can remember . Ofglen is quite a beautiful girl , isn 't she ? She was very pleasant looking . In what way ? Her hair ? Her lips ? What part of her is so very pleasant ? I ... I don 't know . Just , um ... The whole package , I guess . So , on these walks , alone , did you ever do anything more than talk ? Um , I 'm sorry . I don 't know what you mean . Apologies , Offred . This is , rather delicate territory . Did she ever touch you ? No . Never . Did she ever try ? No . Did you know she was a gender traitor ? Yes . How did you know ? Because she mentioned her wife . From before . It was ... It was in passing . In passing . And you didn 't report this to your Mistress ? I 'm sorry , I didn 't think about it . You didn 't think about it . Did she ever tell you she was engaged in a relationship ? She ever talk about a Martha ? No . But you knew what she was ? I knew she was gay . That word is not to be used . Do you understand me ? Yes , Aunt Lydia . That girl , that thing , was an offense to God . She was a disgusting beast . Why didn 't you report the conversation ? Because she was my friend . Remember your scripture . Blessed are the meek . And blessed are those who suffer for the cause of righteousness , for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven . I remember . No ! Stop ! Mrs. Waterford ! This is state business ... No ! She 's pregnant ! Well , this is such wonderful news . Congratulations on your blessed miracle . We have all the information that we need . Get out of my house . It 's okay . We 'll have order , please . Mr. Gambel for the State ? Yes , Your Honor . The accused stand charged with gender treachery , in violation of Romans , Chapter 1 , Verse 26 . By His word . And do you swear by His name that the report you have submitted is the truth entirely ? Yes , I do so swear . Then in the name of God and His servants here on Earth , the accused are hereby found guilty . Martha 6715301 , you are hereby sentenced to the Common Mercy of the State . And you , Handmaid 8967 . Your existence is an abomination . True justice would see you sent to an eternity of suffering . But God has seen fit to make you fruitful , and by that we are bound . Handmaid 8967 , you are sentenced to Redemption . Sentences will be carried out immediately . Can I come in ? Sure . Hi . Hey . I just wanted to check if you were okay . I 'm fine . Thank you . Except for the weird guy who just snuck into my room . Other than that ... You 're dripping . I brought you some ice . Thank you . I wish ... I should 've ... I should 've just driven away with you . No ice cream for you this month , young lady . Boo ! Boo ! This can go in the hall . Offred , blessed day . Please , come on up . What do you think ? I know that we 're still in such early stages . But I 've been wanting to clean this room out for quite some time , and the light here is so beautiful in the morning . And by His word , all things are possible to him that believeth . Mrs. Waterford ... I want to tell you something . Fred and I , we tried for so long . It was hard to keep faith but here you are . You 're right here . You 're my miracle . My beautiful miracle . Truly . Mrs. Waterford , I 'm not pregnant . I got my period . When ? Last night . You will stay here , and you will not leave this room . Do you understand me ? Do you understand me ? Yes , Mrs. Waterford . Things can get much worse for you . The stitches will come out in a few days . I know this is a shock for you , Emily . You can still have children , of course . But things will be so much easier for you now . You won 't want what you cannot have . Blessed be the fruit , dear .

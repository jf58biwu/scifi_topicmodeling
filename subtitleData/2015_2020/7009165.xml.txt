 Krystal Goderitch . That 's hot . She 's investigating this shit . Identical twin abductors ? How freaky is that ? Things keep happening to me ! Hi ! Sarah . This is Adele . This is my biological sister . We 're going to pose as prospective parents to determine if this is a Neolution front ? So who 's going to be the father ? I am . Portia Grossman 's pregnant ? The Grossman 's gave up on IVF years ago . Ask for the " Brightborn Treatments : I 'm Evie Cho , CEO and founder of the Brightborn Group . It 's like a whole new side to Neolution . At Brightborn Technologies , we 're making the world a better place , one baby at a time . Sure you 're ready for this ? - I 'll kick your ass ! - That 's the aggression . Center your feet , feel the mat . - Get off me ! - Great aggression . You and your creepy brother ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! What was that ? I 'm sorry , I ... I got kidnapped by twins , once , nearly . Ugh . They killed my boyfriend , Hector . Sometimes , it just takes a tragedy to find your own resilience . - Yeah , I feel you . Yeah . - Do you know what I mean ? - Can we try other chokeholds ? - Yeah . - Yeah , let me show you this one . - Okay . What you wanna do here is change your leverage position , okay ? So give me an elbow to the midsection . Good . Shot to the groin . Perfect . Like , you know , you can be a victim , or you can totally get to the bottom of it , you know ? Good . Good . So I 've been doing all this Internet research , and I 've discovered that Dyad , Hector and the twins , - they 're all connected . - Okay , so ... Damn , girl . What the hell you been doing got you so strong ? I 'm training like I 'm on a mission ... - Can we do it again ? - You wanna do it again ? - Yes ! Hell , yeah ! - Okay , all right . - That 's my girl , spin around . - Okay . I 'm gonna be ready for them this time . - From the top . - Okay . Shit , woman . Whoo ! When you 're painting , you want to go side to side if it 's long . Right . And then things like the clouds or the mountains or the point of the castle , 'cause they 're really high , you have to paint up and down . Is this like Uncle Felix 's mural ? Don 't tell Felix , but I like this one much better . Don 't tell him . Let me guess , you have to go ? No . Nothing 's getting in the way of our very fun day together ! - No ! - Not even dragons ! - Hey - - Hey - Did you see that research that Alison sent ? Did you look at it ? Yeah , I , uh , glanced at it . Her and Cosima are obsessed with this Brightborn-IVF-Neolution connection . Yeah , but that Evie Cho , she was on the board of Dyad . Oi , GeneConnexion ? That 's the company Felix used to find his bio-sister . I don 't know , is it ? They 're owned by Brightborn . - I knew there was something about Adele . - No ! No , you don 't . It 's probably just a coincidence . I 've researched everywhere . Academic journals , medical forums . I can 't find any data on the Brightborn treatments . The enhancement for embryos ? " Enhancement " could mean anything . Whatever these clients are paying for , Brightborn isn 't sharing it with the scientific community . Oh , dude . The Exclusive Brightborn Orientation is today . I know , that 's why I 'm trying to get Sarah to hustle her way in with Donnie , but she 's spending the day with Kira . So I have to stuff 500 envelopes and cancel my - committee meeting on new math . - Right . What were you gonna do in there exactly ? I don 't know , Sarah things ? Skulk around , look miserable , con people . Okay , well , you don 't even know what you 're looking for in there . I know the science , I 'll go . Really ? Are you feeling up to it ? Put me in , coach . I 'm ready . Okay , Donnie will pick you up . Great . Douglas Andrews , venture capitalist , ready for Brightborn orientation . The plans have changed , Cosima is now carrying your child , Donnie . Oh ! Okay . Urn , so , wait ... Is she gonna be co-parenting this child with Julian and I or is she just gonna be carrying the baby ? Donnie , the baby 's fake . It doesn 't matter . Well , it matters to get the story straight ... No , fitter-patter . It ... It matters . Come on , slowpoke ! Yeah , you 're too fast for me there , babes . Ready ? Uncle Felix ! Hey ! Hello , my little traveler , look at you ! Look at this jacket . That 's brilliant , isn 't it ? - Did you paint all of this ? - I did . Yeah , darling , I painted all of them . - Ever hear of calling first ? - No . S wants you to come to dinner . - Is that a rocket ship ? - You can call it that . I 've met men who do . Uh , this GeneConnexion thing , the way you found Adele , it 's connected to Neolution . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , you 're still on this ? I don 't understand . Yeah , I realize it 's a substantial retainer , Frank . Oh , hi , Sarah . But I 'm expensive because I 'm worth it , Frank . Hello ? Ugh ! Hi . - Hey . You 're still here . - Hey . Yeah , I never left . I love this city . It 's adorable . What 's your name ? Kira . Oh , hello . Felix 's real sister . Real sister ? How ? Uh , we have the same father . I thought you didn 't have a father . Well , I didn 't , but now I do . Or , I did ... You know what ? It 's a long story . All right ! Anyone for mimosas ? So , why can 't Douglas wear a suit ? Mmm , ' cause if you can afford Brightborn , you 're beyond suits . Uh , beyond Armani ? Trust me , I know these people . I grew up in Northern California . It 's like the epicenter of obscene wealth and technological intervention . Douglas is a high net worth individual who 's pining for a baby . Whoa , hey , I know Douglas . I already played him with Felix . You can 't come in and just change my character . - Okay , sorry . - Douglas is chill . - He 's a chill dude , okay ? - Totally . I 'm gay , but I 'm not , like , super gay , so , maybe don 't play the lesbian angle too much . I 'm just gonna let that one slide . Wow , I look like a geriatric skateboarder . Yeah , it 's perfect . All right . Uh , this is you . Alison makes kick-ass ID . - Ava Jakubowski ? - Mmm-hmm . I don 't know . Good afternoon . Hi . May I get the names in your conception team , please ? Yes , I 'm Douglas Andrews . Uh , here 's my ... Ah , thank you . - Perfect . - Thanks . Will your husband Julian be joining us today ? No , Julian is closing a deal in Palo Alto today . But this is our surrogate Ava ... - jacket-jet-ski ... - Jakubowski . Jakubowski . J-A-K ... Thank you . - Welcome , Ava . - Thanks . We 'll start with our nondisclosure agreements . Just sign where the stickers are . Can I get a copy of this ? Uh , once you sign them , for sure . These are your wristbands . And orientation is in the lounge in five . You picked a good weekend . Evie Cho is here in person . Seriously ? Yeah , I 'm in standby mode . I could do a sibling DNA test . Why do you need one ? Uh , no , no reason . Where 's Cosima ? She 's , uh , out for a walk . I mean , a day-long hike . Some walking thing . What ? Scott , where is she ? You tell me , and I 'll tell you . Why do you need a sibling DNA test ? 'Cause I 'm trying to figure out if Felix 's bio-sister is real or not . Okay . Get me hair or saliva samples . And Cosima went undercover into Brightborn . She what ? This place is sweet . She co-authored Leekie 's artificial womb project . It 's creepy shit . Okay , well , if she 's a high level Neo , won 't she know what a clone looks like ? Just blend . I need to find the lab . How ? Hello . Is this your first Brightborn baby ? - Mmm-hmm . - Yeah . My son Georgie is two now and he is just perfect . - Oh , yeah . - Yeah . Good afternoon , everyone . There 's Evie . I love her . Thank you . So , why are we all here ? Uh , peace of mind , personally . All due respect to natural childbirth . Yes , nature can be cruel . When my parents rolled their genetic dice , a single mutation turned me into " The girl in the plastic bubble . " My immune system was severely compromised , a condition known as SCID . Severe combined immunodeficiency . I had pneumonia eight times . I had a bone marrow transplant . The doctors told us this was my life . But the Chos are a fierce and stubborn family . My pa rents , they lobbied , researched , and mortgaged our home to keep going . In 1994 , I entered an experimental gene therapy trial . By the time I graduated from bioengineering , I was in full remission , and as an engineer , when I see a flaw , I wanna fix it . First position , heels together . Very nice . Perfect . That is so good ! Aren 't you a bit tall for ballet ? Ha ! Puberty was a real heartbreak . Okay . Now , think of your hips as a bowl of fruit . So , you don 't wanna tilt one side or the other too much , 'cause then your grapes are gonna go fallin ' out , right ? All right , so , second position . You remember it ? Yeah ! And , beautiful . Oh , my gosh , you are so good ! Mmm . Mmm . You are a very talented dancer . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Is that why you 're always traveling ? You on tour ? I went to go live in Iceland with my granny . In Iceland ? Wow ! I thought your foster family was Irish . Yeah , yeah , Irish travelers , so no fixed address . Do you know how to dance like an Irish traveler , huh ? I don 't know . Uh , Kira , we gotta go . - Aw ! - Already ? Gonna go see Scottie . Check out some comics ! Yeah ? Good . Sorry , big day . - Bye . - Bye . Oh , my God . I 'm late . I 'm late for my own pregnancy . That 's fine . Your name , please ? Christine Wingham . I have heard so much about you guys . I am so excited about my own little Brightborn baby . So , what makes a Brightborn baby different ? And why is it so expensive ? The fees aren 't just for five-star services . They fund research . Our exclusive technology identifies and enhances your most viable embryos . Enhances your embryos how ? I have no idea , I 'm very lost . Brightborn can actually help you do that . And that is my cue . Again , welcome to Brightborn . Your child will thank you . Hi , everyone , I 'm Dr. Bosch . Check your wristbands . Red , you 're off for a facilities tour . Blue , stay put . Hey . We 're gonna talk about pre and post natal care . And I 'll be able to answer any of your questions . I 'm gonna snoop around . - Hey . Be careful . - Find the lab , okay ? Legitimately signing my life away here . This is a lot of paperwork . I 'm just kidding , but I 'm willing to make that sacrifice , you know ? As a mother , it 's worth it . Susan , welcome . Evie , such a beautiful facility you 've built here . Ira loves the pool . Yes . I didn 't know you were coming too , Ira . The incident at your dental clinic is all of our concern . It was Sarah Manning and her people who killed your technician . Which is what I wanna tell you , Susan , I think your runaway clone is here . Sarah Manning 's at Brightborn ? I saw her conning her way into orientation . I 'll get Roxie to pick her up . Not yet ! Let me see her first . Nothing ! No jaundice , no colic . He sleeps well . Latched right away . I gotta say , I get a little ... choked up when I come back here . We were ready to adopt and ... And I 'm sure our family would have been full of love , but wanting a baby , it 's a natural urge . Not just an urge , it 's an imperative . Every living species seeks to propagate . Our genes have a selfish drive to multiply . Would you like to hold him ? Oh , yeah . Hi . Hey , buddy . How are ya ? Hi . Oh , my God , he 's so cute ! Look at him and his little dimples . Hello ! Hello , Mr. Dimples ! Look at him . He 's adorable . Urn ... I have to go shit . Salt water pools . Shiatsu and Swedish massage . Body wraps and yoga . Our birthing suites feature squat bars , rocking chairs , jacuzzi tubs and extra rooms for friends and family . Yeah , I know . I 'm just gonna grab a smoothie , two seconds . - Where are you going ? - I 'll be right there . You have back-to-back C-sections right now . Yeah , yeah , I know . Fine , I 'll be down in the lab . Excuse me , the other floors are off limits . Are you with a group ? Uh ... Uh , yeah . Yeah . Thanks . Detective . Marty . I wanted to , uh , show you something . Do you , um ... Do you know who this is ? It says she 's Alison Hendrix . Uncanny , right ? How much she looks like Beth . - I don 't see it . - And you maintain that position . You don 't wanna go sticking your neck out for the Hendrixes . And why 's that ? Detectives Collier and Lindstein , they have them on the Pouchy-Pozinho thing . The triple homicide ? Not yet , but they do have a move on Pouchy 's pills . And you know what ? They sold the drugs through a soap store . Bubble bath and shit . Unbelievable , right ? Well , what goes on in the suburbs never ceases to surprise . So , one cop to another ? Focus on your real family . Your kids , your ex . Let Beth go . You and Cosima , you guys have to fight all the bad guys . Is this like the dream that you were telling Cosima about ? With the sisters in it ? - No . - No ? So , um , do you wanna talk about anything else ? About your dad , or ... I just wanna play with you . You just wanna play ? All right . I 'm assaying 16 key loci , shouldn 't be too long . You want the glass back ? And that will confirm that ... Not 100 % , but I should be able to tell if they 're siblings . Great . Sorry . Art , what 's going on ? What the hell are the Hendrixes up to ? I don 't know . What are they up to ? Duko just warned me to steer clear of them . He says they 're dealing pills out of Bubbles . - What ? - You don 't know anything about this ? Come on , no . 'Cause I have looked the other way on a lot of shit for you guys . But if I had dinner in a drug front , I 'm exposed . I 'll ... I 'll deal with it , all right ? Okay , you do that . You 're on your own on this one . That doesn 't sound good . Yeah , um ... Do you guys wanna just play up here for a bit ? And I 'm gonna call Auntie Alison . Please tell me you 're not drug dealers . Former , okay ? Yes , we dabbled briefly in prescription pharmaceuticals , but that 's all done now . And as I recall , when we met , you were trying to offload a kilo of cocaine ! That was for Kira . I was desperate . Yes , well , so were we . We were gonna lose our house , Sarah . I don 't care about your bloody house . Art 's job is on the line here . Okay , I get it , you 're mad . I understand . But what do the cops know ? Did Art mention Helena ? What ? What about Helena ? Mmm , nothing . Alison , I swear to God , if you don 't ... She seems to have disappeared . - She 's left . - Left ? Yes , I don 't know , yesterday or the day before . There 's camping gear missing . Camping gear missing ? Where is she ? I don 't know . Look , I 'm not your preggo sister 's keeper . Okay , you dumped Helena on us three months ago , only to bring all this crap back on us . You are so self-righteous , you know that ? - Hello ? - Bitch . Bitch . Is this seat taken ? Oh , don 't stop reading on my account . We encourage our clients to be diligent . Did you have any questions I might answer ? I 'm Susan , by the way . Ava . Hi . Uh , I 'm not a lawyer or anything , but ... I just noticed that under , urn , cryopreservation ... " Written notice within 36 months of any remaining embryos . " So does that mean that if I don 't notify , my embryos just become property of Brightborn ? You can 't own an embryo . They 're donated , for research . What kind of research , exactly ? Oh , it 's all rather technical , actually . - Oh , sorry . - Oh ! I 'm a ... I was a biology major . So I noticed that in all of the pictures ... Thank you , by the way . Uh , the babies have dimples . It 's highly unlikely for that to express itself in every child . Perhaps babies with dimples are more likely to be photographed . So it 's my confirmation bias , then . - Perhaps . - Right . When you say embryonic enhancements , what exactly is that referring to ? Is that mitochondrial transfer , or ... We have been very successful at eliminating certain genetic risk factors . There 's some kind of screening process , then ? Our technique is more direct . You don 't mean germline editing ? Altering the DNA of ... an embryo is very risky . Any mistake and that mutation is passed on to future generations . And that is why germline editing is illegal in most countries . - Mum ! - What ? I tell you about my dreams sometimes . It 's not like that . What 's it like , then ? Do you wanna talk to S about it instead ? Adele ! Oh , hiya , Pumpkin . - They , uh , just popped round for dinner . - Yeah , I see that . Thanks for the invitation . Good for you ! Oh , urn , Sarah ... Okay , earmuffs . Um , Felix told me about your little immigration issues . I just wanted to say , I never was here in your hideout , all holed up . Not that it 's a hole . It 's lovely . It 's okay . I thought we were taking this whole new family thing slow , Fee ? Stop , please . Don 't even start . I 'm sorry , did we not agree on that ? - Stop ! - Okay ! Okay ! A word , please . Now . Fine . They always do this . - There you are ! - Jesus Christ ! - Sorry ! Listen to me . - Dude , I 've got a key-card . - I 'm going up to the lab . - Great . Listen to me ! There 's another clone here . What ? Who ? Big blonde hair , perfect nails ? Voice like a can opener ? Krystal Goderitch ? Who is she ? Why is she at Brightborn ? Trying to have a baby ? I don 't know . She doesn 't even know she 's a clone . Dude , she 's gonna screw this all up . You have to go stop her . Find out what she 's doing and get rid of her , okay ? Okay . Wait , how ? How ? Clean up after me . It would be great if you could honor the fact ... - Hey ! Hey ! - That we need a safe house . You agreed not to bring her here , and then you just walked her right in . It 's a safe house , Fee . You 're paranoid . The two of you , you 're bloody paranoid . Kira 's here . We have a right to be suspicious of Adele . No ! No , you don 't , okay ? 'Cause she 's my sister . I know it in my heart . - Deal with it , Sarah . - I guess we 'll find out . What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? I sampled you both . Scott 's doing a DNA test . You poached our DNA ? Hey , hey ... Uh , can I help you ? I was looking to get a massage . You 're not supposed to be back there , that 's for employees only . - Like myself . - Oh . Okay , I 'm just like , very tight back here , so ... just allow me to ... just , like , right in there . Uh ... Um , we have a schedule here , so ... Let me just ... Okay , good news , I have an appointment available right now , if you 're interested . - Great , I 'll take it . - Okay . It 's with myself . Ronnie . Okay . Let 's do ourselves a massage . Uh , if you 'll follow me . The room is ... over here . There it is . And if you wanna just take your dress off and just lie on your face . And I will be in there . That is not Sarah Manning . That is Cosima Neihaus . - Mmm , the self-aware biology student . - What ? She 's quite perceptive . Amazing , really ... the innate human drive to know the truth of ourselves . Yes , that 's amazing , Susan , but have we forgotten what happened the last time a perceptive clone came poking around my side of things ? It did not end well . I know you hate to intervene , Susan , but , uh ... Evie 's right . Yes , I suppose she 's come too far . Bring her in . Rig ht away . Yes ? - Are you decent ? - Mmm-hmm . I see you 've made yourself comfortable . Um ... Someone seems a little tense . 1 am . God , you 're so intuitive . I 'm actually in the healing arts , too . Oh , are you a doctor , or ... No , I 'm a beautician . So , basically , I , like , um , help people reveal their true beauty . Basically . Wow , that sounds so wonderful . The hardest people though are , like , pregnant women . 'Cause they 're very self-centered , you know ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , ' cause the mums are like ... " No toxins , please , " but I 'm like , " Mummy has a mustache . " Mama needs bleach . " Do you know what I mean ? Mmm-hmm . Yeah , you know , I find this whole Brightborn thing kinda creepy ... You don 't even know the half of it . Can I trust you ? Of course . Healer to healer . MY purse . Okay , um ... To tell you the truth , I 'm on a professional investigation right now . Do you know the Dyad Institute ? I don 't think so . Well , I truly believe that along with Brightborn , they 're conducting human experiments . Stem cells in cosmetics . I 'm sorry , in what ? There is this woman and she got stem cell treatment in her face , and every time she blinked , it clicked . Guess why ? - Uh , I don 't know . - Guess . Um , she ... 'Cause she was growing teeth out of her eyelids . Read it . Eyelid teeth ? Yes , and I 'm being personally targeted , because I 'm a whistle-blower , right ? I 'm like that guy who moved to Russia . And if that French blonde doctor hadn 't saved me , I would be , like , physically dead right now . French doctor , do you mean Dr. Cormier ? How do you know that name ? How do you know that name ? Don 't worry . Don 't worry , I 'm actually here to help you , Krystal . How do you know my name ? Uh ... That 's right , massage faker ! Oh , my God . I 'm sorry . I 'm sure you are . Come with me , please . Let go of me . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! What are you doing ? Like , where are you taking me right now ? I didn 't do anything wrong . Excuse me , do you talk ? Hello ? This isn 't fair , I didn 't ... I didn 't do anything ! Hello ? No , okay ? This isn 't right . I know you can hear me . Fine . I stole these , okay ? I 'm sorry , I 'm a beauty professional . I 'm interested in the trade . Evie , that 's Krystal Goderitch . I 'm sorry , who 's Krystal Goderitch ? Krystal is a naive subject . I 'll speak with security , get them to track down the right LEDA . This is so ridiculous . She has some delusions about her circumstance , but she 's harmless . I just came here to have , like , a baby . No ! Let me go ! No ! Get it out ! Get it out . I can 't do it . Where are you taking me ? Well , I feel like a zit . It 's kinda weird , right ? Me just popping up out the blue . Darling , you don 't have anything to apologize for , okay ? You 're a little , uh , unexpected . Plus , I 'm a total disaster . You know , since my daddy died , I 've just been , like ... Like , off the rails . I 'd probably think I was after Fee 's money or something . Thankfully , no problem there . So , is it expensive , GeneConnexion ? Hmm , sorry ? GeneConnexion . The way you found Felix . - Chicken ? - Is that quite expensive ? What ? No . No , it 's cheap . Everyone 's doing it . Spit in a cup , mail it off . I don 't know that everyone 's comfortable coughing up their genetic profile to a corporation . Can you back off ? That better not be contraband food I see there . Back to your room , go on , get going . All right . Okay , Tabitha , I 'm going to need a urine sample from you . Can I have Denelle 's OR slot ? Give me a break . She sounded pretty far along . Do you wanna get paid ? Yeah , it 's just , it 's my son 's birthday this weekend . I was supposed to be done by now . Honey , you know you can 't leave . You 'll be disqualified from the study . Now , come on , let 's get you to the washroom . - Hello . - Hello . I think I only have three faces . Hey , so why GeneConnexion ? Oh , this again ? Well , there 's a lot of other companies that do it . I ... I don 't know . I mean , maybe the commercials . GeneConnexion , your family finders Yeah ! I didn 't really know what it meant though , until I saw Felix 's face for the first time . Oh , I was expecting a Republican with big hair . - What 's a Republican ? - Oh . Sweetheart , let 's not give you nightmares . Kira , you 're finished , so , come on over , take your plate . You can help me do dessert . Go easy . Yeah , nothing 's ever easy with you , though , is it , Sarah ? I guess not . Are you an arsehole , or is it just that thing in your face ? So , did you submit your DNA first ? Or did Felix ? Sarah , I 'm sorry I 'm such an albatross for you . - I love my new brother . - I just don 't believe that . - Really ? - No . I should just go . No , you know what ? I think you should stay . Maybe you should go , hmm ? - Felix ! - What ? Come on ! MRS. - What age are you ? Hey , Scott . Yeah . Oh , okay . Yep . Yeah , thanks . Okay . Sorry , Adele , I had , um ... I had you and Felix , uh , genetically tested . I thought we already did that . Yeah . Yeah , you did . She 's my sister , isn 't she ? Yeah . Yeah , she is , yeah . May we be excused ? Yes , love . Of course you can . It 's okay . Great . Well , I guess this meal 's over . Sit down . Finish your dinner . Welcome to the family . Sh it , sorry . Thank you . We 've got a carrier fully dilated . Give me a hand . Come on . Oh ... Oh , God , I 'm gonna push . - Not yet . - Oh , please . They promised it would be a C-section ! Too late for that now . She 's fully dilated , spines plus one . Can you call the OB ? Dr. Moffat 's such an ass . I bet he went to get a smoothie . Hey , I 'm in the carrier ward , four west . I 'm with Denelle . Batch 42 . We need an OB . That 's it . Nice and slow . Let 's get her on to her side . Hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . Just breathe , okay ? You have children and mothers , do you know what I mean ? No , we apologize greatly , greatly for the misunderstanding . You 're gonna hear from my lawyer about this . Sure , and you are more than welcome to ... Calm down , Ms. Wingham . Do you know who you employ here ? Ms. Wingham , stay calm . Everything is okay ! That face ? I have seen that face before ! It 's okay . Things are okay . I thought it was Braxton Hicks . The contractions were mild and irregular . Not anymore . She 's fully dilated , spines plus two . Slide down the bed for me , Denelle . My mum said this was wrong . Grab her legs . There 's meconium . Call the resus team . Yeah , I need a resus team for a met delivery , four east . Oh , God ! Oh , God , forgive me . The head 's coming . God forgive me . One more big push ! That 's it , one more last push . She 's out . Get the IV . Shit . Positive for BP syndrome , orofacial clefts , ectodermal anomalies , severe popliteal webbing . Cosima ? Remember me ? Susan . Duncan ? Perhaps we should discuss why you 're really here . I finally meet my maker and this is what you 're doing . You 're allowing emotions to cloud your judgment . Think like a scientist . Brightborn has identified genes that eliminate dozens of childhood illnesses . These are human beings that you 're tinkering with . Trial and error without consent . These carriers are very well compensated . And does that justify the baby that I saw ? Evie , give us the room . I 'm sorry . It is a passionate subject for all of us . How can you even support this ? You don 't even know the long-term effects of it . Look at me , I 'm sick . I never gave permission for any of this . No one gives permission to be born . I created you as a beautiful baseline , to unlock the mysteries of the human genome . We 're your Oncomice . And you have seen the alternative . The carriers ? The device in Sarah ? These are brutish techniques compared to LEDA . We 're not giving you Kendall so you can make more lab rats . Cosima , you 're dying . And you know that you don 't have the resources to save yourself . But share the original 's genome , and together , we can make a cure for all of you . Sorry , I ruined dinner . We still had a really fun day . Mummy ... Mmm ? Your sisters ... I know how they feel sometimes . How do you mean ? Like ... Cosima , when she 's sad . Helena , when she 's lonely . Rachel 's the angriest . There 's even some I don 't know . I 'm sorry , monkey . I didn 't understand . Those aren 't dreams . So , what are they ? I don 't know , monkey . I wish I did . I feel you , too , Mummy . I love you . It 's up to them now . Were you able to reason with her ? We are as close to the original as we have ever been . To a cure ? Yes , my love . Susan Duncan ? We can start work on a cure . If you just share Kendall . Just my bloody luck . Sarah , you watch your back . This is what killed Beth . Oh , my god ! - Oh , Jesus . - God , it burns . If I pull it out it could rupture . You 're doing really well , Sarah . There 's some kind of Trojan wiping our research . - Are you out of your mind ? - Benjamin ! I may not have that much time , Sarah .

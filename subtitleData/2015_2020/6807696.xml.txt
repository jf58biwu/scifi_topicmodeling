 - [ grunts ] - [ gate creaking ] [ Marco ] I didn 't find anything . No agents , no exit , nothing . What about food ? Fuck , I 'm hungry . What time is breakfast ? I 'm no good without breakfast . [ Rafael ] That doesn 't do anything . I already tried . I already tried , Marco . [ creaking ] See ? - Congratulations ! - How could your family stand you ? The question is , how could I stand them . Trust me . [ woman ] Marco ! Marco ! Marco , come eat . A little more ... - Take some more . - No . What are you talking about , boy ? You are the one who needs to eat . You need to bulk up . Show the Process that you 're better than those bums out there . Your birthday present . - You already got me a present . - This one isn 't from me . When your parents left me to take care of you , they gave me this letter . They told me to give it to you on your 20th birthday . It 's your last birthday here . Soon , your picture will be up on the wall with theirs . You 'll be on the Offshore , Marco . Go get everyone . I know what we need to do to get out of here . A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [ theme music playing ] CHAPTER 04 GATE - How are we doing ? - Good . Six hours in . It looks like Marco figured out the panel . - [ Álvaro ] Confirming expectations . - Really ? Interesting . Are we really supposed to just wait around ? - And for how long ? - I don 't know . Being stuck here as a couple like you two can 't be that bad . - What ? - [ girl chuckles ] - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - It 's the Process . This must be a test . Yeah , but what kind of test ? Do they want us to wait ? Escape ... ? If the Process locked me up here , I 'm happy to stay . So if the Process told you to eat shit , you would ? If it smelled good and it came from the Offshore ... - [ scoffs ] - Gross ! Are you serious ? Hey . Let 's go up front . Marco 's calling everyone . I knew he 'd figure it out . Here 's the deal . This screen shows 64 zeros and ones . The same number of levers in this dorm . Eight rooms , eight levers , eight times eight . These numbers are instructions . - Instructions for what ? - To do handstands . We need to form groups . Who 's got a good memory ? [ silent counting ] [ Marco ] We 'll need a group of eight memorizers . Each one will memorize a line and take it to the corresponding room . One-zero-one-one zero-zero-zero-one . Go ! [ Marco ] Pullers will be waiting in each room . When they get the sequence , they 'll move the levers . " Zero " means up , " one " means down . It 's not easy . They are very hard to pull . Go ! Zero-one-one , zero-one-one , zero-one ! Zero-zero-one , zero-zero-one zero-zero . [ Marco ] We have to do this in all eight rooms , at the same time . And we need to finish before a new sequence pops up on the screen . Go ! Go ! Everyone together ! Run ! Zero-zero-one-one zero-one-zero-one . - What ? - Zero-zero-one-one-zero-one-zero-one . Got it ! [ Marco ] It 's a strategy test . Everyone has to do their part . Everyone has to participate . That 's what the Process wants . - [ woman ] Go , go , go ! - Let 's go ! Focus ! Everyone together ! Go ! [ Marco ] Run , go ! Go ! - [ thunk ] - [ all cheering ] Yeah ! - Yeah , Marco ! - [ excited chatter ] Open it , open it ! Yeah , Marco ! It worked ! Ah , they did it on their first try . Marco is clearly the leader . He took on the leadership role and organized the group without conflict . Not that this makes a difference , but he 's my favorite candidate . [ Ezequiel ] It 's a good start . I want to see what their plan is for the division . Water ... and food ! So , we 're gonna be stuck in this hole . It looks like it . I was expecting a key or something . Magrão , go check on the gate . [ Magrão struggles against gate ] - [ woman ] Oh , no . - At least we 're not gonna starve . But look at the size of that . It 's not enough to feed a bird . So , who gets the first kit ? I solved the problem , organized everyone and I 'm hungry . Anyone disagree ? I disagree . If we hadn 't pulled the levers , there wouldn 't be any food . Yeah . What about us ? If we hadn 't memorized it all correctly , - the levers would be useless . - That makes sense ... Hold on ! Those levers are heavy . [ all shouting ] Silence ! Silence ! Silence ! - Put your finger down . - Shut up . - Let 's do it alphabetically . - Alphabetically ? No way ! Shut up . Why are you whining ? Just because your name starts with " R " ? Guys , look , everyone 's role is crucial . That 's why the test exists . Alphabetical order is fair . Everyone will get their turn . It 's better than wasting time arguing . Fine , Michele . Alphabetically it is . Ágata , you 're first . - [ Magrão ] Hurry , I wanna eat . - [ Marco ] Okay , guys ! Take your places . The faster we do this , the sooner we 'll eat . Let 's go ! Quickly ! Ágata , memorize it . [ Marco ] Let 's go ! Let 's go ! [ computer voice ] Ezequiel 's room . Access granted by Councilor Matheus . User Ezequiel , confirm fingerprint . UNAUTHORIZED FINGERPRINT [ device beeping ] Cássia ? - [ footsteps in hallway ] - [ door beeps ] Aline , stop . You owe Ezequiel an explanation . Don 't say anything . Just follow me . Let 's go , let 's go ! [ clapping ] Focus ! Everyone together ! Let 's go ! Go ! - Hey ! - One-zero-one-one zero-zero-zero-one . Go ! Quickly ! [ Marco ] Go ! That 's it ! Quickly ! Quickly ! Zero-zero-one-one zero-one-zero-one . - Zero-zero-one ... - One-zero-zero-zero-one , go ! [ Marco ] Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Focus ! Go ! Work together ! There ! The other one is zero-zero-one-one zero-one-zero-zero . Go . Go , go , go , go ! [ Álvaro ] Vanessa ! What ? Poor Vanessa ... she was the last one to eat . She 's so skinny , she must be about to faint . I think it 's time we open the gate . How many candidates have been eliminated ? None . Marco brought them together , they were organized until the end . Everyone did their part with very little conflict . In my opinion , Ezequiel , everyone passed . No . [ sighs ] Otávio ? Let 's make a few changes . [ all panting ] Did the food drop ? Do you think it broke ? And people still say the Process is perfect . Enough of this . Sonia , where are you going ? Sonia ! What are you doing ? [ Marco ] Let 's go , let 's go ! Focus ! Focus ! - Stop ! Stop , Marco ! - [ Marco ] Quickly , go ! What are you doing ? Go back to the room . It 's no use . It stopped working . We 're tired . Someone must have missed a number . Go back . Ten times in a row ? I don 't think so . They stopped sending us food . You don 't know that . We can 't stop . Dude , don 't you get it ? This is useless . It 's true . We 're just wasting energy . - It 's probably night already . - But the lights are still on . What difference does it make ? There are no windows . Lights on or off , I wanna sleep . - Yeah , let 's go . - Let 's get some rest . - We 'll see if it 's working later . - Yeah , let 's rest . No , you don 't understand . We can 't stop . This is a test . We can 't give up ! I 'm sure about that . We can 't give up ! This is a ... This is a test ! It 's a test ! Bunch of wimps . [ Ágata repeating numbers softly ] Ágata , what are you doing ? One-zero-one-zero ... one-zero-one-zero ... Ágata , stop . There 's no one here . Come on . [ shrieks ] No ! One-zero-one-zero-one ... [ continues counting ] [ sobs ] Now , Otávio . Everything we 've got . [ mechanical creaking ] [ thudding ] [ overlapping chatter ] What 's going on ? So many ! I knew the Process wouldn 't let us starve ! - Awesome ! - Pass it down ! - [ chatter , cheering ] - Easy , guys ! Easy , easy , easy . - [ Michele ] Guys , hold on ! - [ Fernando ] Careful with my wheelchair ! Let 's get organized ! I 'm serious . I 'm going to count the packets and we 'll split everything equally . [ all shouting ] If we get organized , everyone will eat . Do you wanna leave a friend without food ? - [ man ] I 'm starving . - Come on , guys . Give it back . [ low murmurs ] - [ Magrão ] No , no ... - Magrão , please . - [ overlapping chatter ] - [ man ] Give it back . Give it back . [ Michele ] Try not to kick the food . Give me some room here , let 's go . I 'm putting water on this side and food on that side . Um ... - I 'm not questioning you , but- - - Go ahead and ask . I just want to understand what 's behind this change . I want to see how they deal with a different situation . You get it ? [ Álvaro ] Uh-huh . [ stammers ] Different situation ... [ Michele ] Three packets per person . Guys , let 's get in line , please . Everyone on this side . That 's it . Joana , here . Ágata ... Take Ágata with you . What ? You 're not eating , big guy ? Then can I take your share ? I 'll take that as a yes . Let me ask you something . - Really ? You want to ask me ? - Yeah . You 're a pain in the ass but you 're not stupid . - Thanks . - Why did they send so much at once ? - Because we 're not leaving anytime soon . - Yeah , the test has changed . We have to find a way to get out of here . That 's now the goal . [ gate creaking ] We 're gonna need a lever . I 'm gonna round up some strong people to help us out . Mm . This water tastes weird . It 's probably from the Offshore . If it 's from there , it 's the weird taste of purity . - [ Rafael ] Hey ! - Excuse us . How are you ? What are you doing ? Relax . We 're just gonna borrow a few things . This is fucking hard . [ Marco ] Everybody together . One , two ... Go ! [ gate creaking ] - [ grunting ] - It 's not working . - Shut up . - One , two , three , go ! Aline has entered my room and went through my things without my permission . Ezequiel , keep in mind that Aline has the Council 's authority . Matheus , keep in mind that a spy has no authority . Think about what you 're saying . I 'm thinking very clearly , Nair . And if you have an issue with me , Matheus , you come here yourself . Don 't ever send your minions to spy on me , do you understand ? - You 're crossing a line . - You 've already crossed it , Matheus . Excuse me . As much as this may bother you , I have a Process to lead . - [ Matheus ] Ezequiel ! Don 't you dare ! - Goodbye . - Don 't you dare ! - Goodbye . Now , go , go ! - Go ! - Come on , come on ! Open it wider ! Wider ! Open it wider ! Wider ! Open it wider ! Wedge it ! Wedge the gate ! Wider ! Go , go ! Come on , come on ! - Brace it ! - There ! - [ all ] Yeah ! - Hell , yes ! Let 's get out of this fucking place , bro . Who wants to do the honors ? [ gate creaks ] So ? Anyone ? - I don 't think I can fit . - Me neither . [ drops metal lever ] [ man ] So ? There 's another gate . We 'll make the opening bigger , then open the other gate . No , it won 't work . It looks like a safe . It 's impossible to open . We 're not supposed to get out . - We 're stuck here . - [ Magrão ] Now what ? I 'm hungry . - My food is gone too . - You ate all your food . For real ? Yes , for real . Working hard makes you hungry . Unbelievable . So , let 's go get some more . What 's up ? We 're working on the gate and you 're doing nothing . It 's only fair that you share your food and water . What 's that ? You want to take our food ? Yes . That 's exactly what we want . [ chuckles ] In your dreams . You were trying to open that gate because you 're all idiots . - That 's not my problem . - Sure it is . This is a social test , remember ? Everyone has their role . - If you won 't help , your food will . - Fuck you , Marco . You think you 're better than me just because you 're playing boss ? You can 't tell me what to do , you piece of shit . [ Magrão ] Sit down ! Sit down ! - [ Marco grunting ] - [ gasping ] Let go ! Let me go ! [ grunts ] Marco , let him go ! Marco ! Enough , man ! Enough ! I 'll let go when he cooperates . There ... It 's there . Over there . What about you guys ? Don 't you want to contribute ? Take everything ! Let 's go ! - Got everything ? - Yeah . It 's gonna be okay . We 'll open the gate and forget all about this . Why did you do that , Marco ? We 're not gonna get that gate open . - That plan is over . - Exactly . Don 't you get it ? Only three percent will pass . The rest will be left behind . That 's the idea behind the Process and this test is no different . You know I 'm right . You stole the cube in the first test . You did what you had to do . I was stupid and it took me too long to understand . We 're not here to share . They want to find the elite . [ soft chuckle ] I 'm an Álvares . I 'm part of the elite . Smile , Marco . Got it . It 'll look great on the wall . - Larissa , did you get what I asked for ? - Right here . Don 't take too long . You don 't wanna be late for the Process . [ Marco ] Just like my parents left me a letter , and my grandparents left them one , too , I leave you this letter ... my son . - For my son . - Of course . [ Marco ] We never met , but you carry the name and the history of this family . You are an Álvares . And being one of us means that we are superior . We are the elite and we deserve to pass the Process . [ Larissa ] Take care . [ Marco ] I have only one piece of advice for you : - take what 's rightfully yours . - [ overlapping chatter ] Hand it over . Give it to me . [ indistinct chatter ] Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Go , go , go ! [ woman sobbing ] And the truth comes out . [ Marco ] Shut up . - Let 's open the gate , Ezequiel . - No . Go , go , go ! Go , go ! - This way . - Let 's go ! [ Marco ] Go , go , go ! - Fuck ! A little warning ? - Shut up . Did you see that ? I knew shit was gonna hit the fan . They 're gonna steal everyone 's food . - We need to do something . - You do whatever you want . - I 'm getting out of here . - Getting out ? Where to ? All I know is I 'm starving . I didn 't come here for this shit . Our side has enough of that already . [ Marco ] Go ! Let 's go ! Come on ! [ Fernando ] Go back ! Go back to your room ! Marco and that son of a bitch Rafael ganged up . They 're stealing water and food from everyone . We have to defend ourselves . [ Marco ] Go , go , let 's go ! - This is your new home . Let 's go ! - [ indistinct chatter ] Juliano , if anyone tries to get out ... What are you doing , man ? Maintaining control in case anyone tries anything stupid . Let 's go ! [ Magrão ] Let 's fucking do this ! Ezequiel , the situation is getting out of hand . I want to see how this plays out . - [ Marco ] It 's over there . Go get it . - [ chaotic chatter ] Aline , how could you have let them catch you ? You should 've been more careful . But I 'm starting to get somewhere . I had to spend political capital to keep you there . Matheus , I 'm really very close to succeeding . I don 't want " close . " I want you to accomplish your mission , do you understand ? Ágata ? Ágata ? [ alert beeping ] Whoops . Don 't do anything , okay ? [ grunts ] [ woman ] Give me a beam . Do you have an extra beam , Fernando ? It 's loose . - Hand me a piece of wood . - [ Fernando ] Here you go . Tie it , tie it ! Tie it , Camila . That 's it . It 's closed . Over here , are we good ? - Tie it down there . - Is there any wood left ? [ Magrão in distance ] Give up your food . Come on . - [ Fernando ] Go , go , go ! Close it . - Go , go ! [ Ezequiel ] The official test is only the first part . It 's meant to analyze how they organize tasks and resources . The candidates pull the levers and the food drops . If that 's the test , then we passed . Yes , but there 's a problem . People assume that their work will always be compensated , that resources are endless ... and that the world is fair . But you know very well that the world isn 't fair , right , Joana ? And it 's at times like these that people show their true colors . [ gasping , grunting ] Tell me where the food is . Where 's the food ? Where 's the food ? Where is it ? What are you hiding there ? I 'm gonna ask you one more time . - What are you hiding there ? - Nothing . [ screaming ] [ shouting ] [ panting , gasping ] No ! [ screams ] Goddamn . That 's not very nice . - Apologize . - [ panting ] Apologize . I 'm sorry . That 's not enough ! We had to make an example out of someone . Don 't you understand ? This is a microsociety . There are those who rule and those who obey ! It 's the natural order of the world . Help me out here ! [ Marco ] Go ! - The girl 's dead , Marco . She 's dead . - She shouldn 't have hidden food . - The Process wants us to keep control . - No , you asshole . That 's what you want ! [ screams ] [ man ] What the fuck is going on here ? [ Marco ] Run , Rafael . Run . You 're dead , motherfucker ! [ Marco in distance ] Motherfucker ! - [ panting ] Michele ! Michele , let me in . - Shh ! Lower your voice . You 'll draw them this way . - They 're gonna kill me . - We 're not letting you in . - They 're gonna kill me ! - Get out of here ! It 's a trick ! Don 't open it for him . - No , no ! It 's not a trick ! - Don 't open it ! - No ! It 's not ! - Rafael , lower your voice ! Leave ! [ inaudible ] Come on . - Don 't let him in ! No ! Michele ! - [ Michele ] He 's coming in ! - Go ! - Close it ! [ Michele ] Open up , quick ! - Hold on ! Easy ! - Come on , come on ! [ all shouting ] Motherfuckers ! You 're gonna die ! You 're not going to do anything ? Can 't you stop the test ? - I can 't . - Why not ? Because you are the ones who did this , Joana . You let it come to this . If anyone is going to stop the test , it has to be one of you . You , perhaps ? - Me ? - You . Orphan . Abandoned . You had to learn everything on your own . You never had anything . Yet , you survived . You probably fucked up and had to run away . I know , Joana . You suffered , but that has made you stronger . More prepared . You could show that you are worthy of the Offshore and- - The Offshore wasn 't meant for people like me . The Offshore was meant exactly for people like you , Joana . [ all shouting ] [ Ezequiel ] What do you know about the Founding Couple ? They built the Offshore . They came from poverty , Joana . Discredited , treated like garbage . But they seized the opportunity to become people of the greatest importance . - Here . - I 'm not hurting anyone . - What ? - I 'm not hurting anyone . But they have no problem hurting you or me . Take this shit ! Why is the Process doing this to us ? [ shouting ] [ Ezequiel ] Are you hungry ? If you eat , you 'll be eliminated . - What ? - It wouldn 't be fair to the others . What if I don 't ? You finish the test . Make a difference in there , and prove to yourself that you deserve better . Like them . Now ! Go , go ! [ overlapping shouts ] Hold on ! Hold on ! You 're all fucked ! [ all shouting ] [ shouting continues in distance ] - [ Joana grunts ] - [ body thuds ] [ overlapping shouts ] Hold it ! Hold it there ! [ Joana ] They 're over here ! [ overlapping shouts ] What the hell ? Motherfucker ! [ all shouting , screaming ] [ Magrão ] Motherfucker ! Let go of me ! [ Joana ] Stop ! Stop ! That 's enough . Enough ! It 's over . You can come out . Come on . [ siren wailing ] [ metal creaking ] - It 's open . The gate is open ! - [ all cheering ] - [ Rafael ] Go . - [ Fernando ] Thank you . Go . [ coughing ] [ grunts ] [ panting ] [ sobbing ] - [ device beeps ] - [ alarm wailing ] [ gates creaking ] GATES CLOSING - [ bones cracking ] - [ screaming ] [ scream echoes ] What did he say to you ? Rafael . What did he say for you to let him in ? Nothing . I just believed him . [ Rafael ] Today , little brother , the drinks are on me . [ chuckles ] [ brother sighs ] So ? Are you ready ? No . [ chuckles ] Twenty years . When you 're a kid , it seems like it will take forever . And then , out of nowhere , your Process is next week . - You 're screwed . Totally screwed . - Screwed . I don 't know if I 'm going to pass , but I wanna make it far , like you did . - What 's wrong ? - I didn 't get far at all . I was eliminated right off the bat . On the first day . But that was a year ago . It 's done . Now it 's your turn . Yes . It 's my turn . - You will do great , Rafael . - Thanks , Tiago . - [ grunts ] - Hey ... hey . Are you okay ? Come on . Easy . There you go . I 'm okay . I just need to lie down for a bit . [ groans ] [ soft snoring ] I 'm sorry , Rafael . Tiago . I found a way to join the Process again . A new registration . Ivana , you can trust me . This time , I won 't disappoint the Cause . [ Ezequiel ] Welcome to the garden . Only nine percent of all candidates get this far . Consider yourselves privileged .

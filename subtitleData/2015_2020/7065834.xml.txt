 It 's all going public . The bribes now connect Kuwaiti businessman Hashem Al-Khatib to the fringe futurist movement Neolution . ( Grunts ) Scott : They 're grabbing Helena just as her babies are coming to term . Cosima : He wants cord blood , the mutation , for himself , and then to exploit . - ( Grunts ) - Contraction . Why would they go anywhere near Dyad right now ? Rachel : They 're taking her to the Old Wing . He 's hiding right next to Dyad as it self-destructs . Aah ! Live organ . Hell-Wizard : I worked security . I can get us into that wing . ( Siren wailing ) Go see what 's happening . ( Helena moans ) Hell-Wizard : Are you sure the alarm 's a good idea ? Yeah . I want them here so I get first drop . Helena : You are shit mother . Come on . We 've got to get you out of here . ( Grunts ) Ooh . Babies coming . ( Sighs ) Have you really thought this through ? Yeah , yeah ! I have . I 'm not a bloody idiot , am I ? We can ... We can reschedule . You don 't have to do it yet . What if I said I wanted to have it , what would you say ? I would say bringing a life into this world is a really big responsibility , Sarah . And I 'm too messed up to do it ? Spit it out , S. Do you want to have this baby ? Raise a child . Do you ? Only you can decide , chicken . - ( Alarm blaring ) - ( Helena whimpering ) - ( Lift bell dings ) - ( Sarah ) Shit ! Go take that east door . I 'll get the west . Lock it down . ( Alarm continues ) - Come on . - ( Grunts ) This way . Sestra , I can 't . We need to find another way out . I need to sit . ( Grunts ) I can 't go on . No , no , no , come on . Stay with me . Meathead , I 'm right here . ( Alarm continues blaring ) ( Shouts ) Where are they ? ( Sarah ) Shit . ( Theme music playing ) ( Shouts ) How could you let a woman in labor escape ? ( Alarm blaring ) Get out . We 're searching . They won 't go far . Don 't look . Her water broke . The alarm went off before they jumped me , all right ? They are still in the building . - How close are the contractions ? - ( Grunting ) Okay , close . Come here . Lay down . Lay down . - Here , got you . - ( Grunts ) ( Sarah ) Got it . Breathe . Breathe , Helena . That alarm is our people . Okay ? So they tracked me here . We 're not alone . ( Whispers ) There you go . - Shh , shh . - I need water . Water ? Okay , I 'll find you some . ( Alarm continues blaring ) ( Keypad beeping ) ( Alarm stops ) We may have had an intruder . You said we were secure . You said you had the strength to keep all those investigators next door out of here . For now , yes . ( Coady over radio ) Enger , report . What have you got ? ( Grunts ) ( Breathes heavily ) You 're a shitty partner , Enger . Enger ? Enger ? ( Art ) She 's off the clock , Coady . ( Coady over radio ) Come in . Has anybody got a 20 on Enger ? We 're locked down . When I left Enger , she was headed in the west entrance . Concentrate the search on the west side of the building . ( Man 1 over radio ) Move to the west . From the top down . ( Man 2 over radio ) Roger . Got it . I 'll help find Helena , then we 'll deliver the babies and extract the mutation as fast as we can . No , we can 't isolate a mutation here . We don 't know who got in . ( Slurring ) We only need to move everything on the helicopter . John , what is it ? Doc ! Come on , sit down . Chest pains ? Are you dizzy ? I 'm fine . - John ? - Yes . - Are you still with me ? - Yes . Virginia , find Helena . - Stay right here till we do . - ( John breathes heavily ) Give him an EKG . And pack everything up . We 're evacuating . ( Groaning ) Uh , you can 't move . I think we 're gonna have to do this here . No , no , no , no . ( Sarah ) I need medical supplies . Sarah , I can 't have babies here . We , we just need clean sheets , and we need help . Okay ? Here , hold on to that . I 'll be right back . - ( Mumbles ) - I promise . - Don 't go . - ( Shushing ) - Don 't go . - Try to be quiet . - Don 't go . - They are looking for us . I 'll be right back . ( Man 1 ) Floors above are clear . ( Man 2 over radio ) Roger . ( Coady ) I think they 're close . We 'll find them . ( Man ) Good here . You got anything ? I 'll take this side . Go to that west door . See what the hell happened to Enger . And check every room on the way . ( Man ) Yeah , I got it . Shh , shh , shh ... Art , Helena is giving birth right now . Jesus Christ , now ? We need to help her . She 's down there . Last door on the right , all the way down to the bottom . Okay , where you going ? ( Stammers ) I 'm getting medical equipment . No , listen . Wait , wait , wait . You need forceps , you need scissors and you need sutures . Here , you take this . We are on our own down here . The old man 's still protected . We can 't trust any of the authorities outside . But when we 're ready to go , Felix and Donnie will be waiting for us . - Okay . - Sarah , just be careful . I thought we were organizing the helicopter . Yes , we are , from the roof . You know , I ... Chitty Chitty Bang Bang . There you go . Would you ? That 's pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine . I don 't recommend this in your condition . You think you don 't , but you do . - ( Radio beeps ) - ( Man ) Dr Coady , come in . Go ahead for Coady . Enger is down . Someone took her radio . ( Coady over radio ) Then our intruder is listening . Radio silence , please . ( Man over radio ) Roger . ( Exhales ) ( Gasps ) ( Man 1 ) Is that gear almost packed ? ( Man 2 ) Almost . ( Man 1 ) Well , hurry up . He wants it on the roof in five minutes . ( Man 1 ) Speed it up . Let 's go . ( Grunting ) ( Panting ) Ah , Helena . Let 's try this again . ( Grunting ) This is more your style , isn 't it ? Down here in the filth and garbage . Keep away from me . How frequent are your contractions ? You feeling the urge to push yet ? It 's a shame we don 't have the nice , clean operating theater . But I 've done worse in the field . ( Sniffles ) ( Mobile phone rings ) - You found her ? - ( Coady ) Yes . I 'm in the basement . She 's alone . No Sarah . Very good . Bring her to the roof . We can 't go anywhere yet . She 's about to deliver . Look , I 'm coming down . No , stay where you are . ( Coady over phone ) Send me some help and get everything ready to go . What ? Virginia ! Sir , I think it would be best if you stayed here . - Do you ? - In this state , yes . You 're putting yourself under a lot of strain for man of your age . " Man my age . " ( Helena grunting ) Helena . - Arthur . - Drop it . You all right ? Most excellent . Quit resisting , Helena . - ( Grunts ) - There 's no stopping it now . What the hell are you doing ? ( Chuckles ) I learned my lesson getting too close to this one . - You 're the midwife . - What ? - Glove up . - Jesus , you serious ? Come on . Hurry up . - I 'll tell you what to do . - ( Helena grunts ) Helena , you okay ? Not her . Not like this . I need you to see how far dilated she is , Detective . Jesus . Dilated . ( Stammers ) She 's close . Put your fingers in and tell me how open her cervix is . - Ah , freaking ... - ( Coady ) Come on ! ( Grunting ) That 's good . Three minutes apart . ( Coady ) Come on . ( Exclaims ) ( Breathing heavily ) ( John ) How fitting you return to your cage . All lab rats do ... In the end . You never caged us . Not me and Helena . You 've got nothing to do with who we really are . You 're the only set of twins we ever had . Fertile freaks . And one of them birthing in my basement . Oh , yes . We 've found her . - I need to push . - ( Coady ) You need to push ? - Shit , she 's gonna deliver . - ( Grunting ) I have to get up . No . No , you don 't . - ( Art ) Easy , Helena . - I need to move . Okay , no , no , no , no . You stay on your back , okay ? - ( Helena ) No , I need to move . - Lie down , Helena . ( Grunting ) Jesus , there 's , uh ... She 's bleeding ! There 's a ... There 's a ... There 's a lot of blood . - Haemorrhage ? Shit . - ( Grunting ) ( Coady exclaims ) ( Gasping ) ( Grunts ) ( Art grunts ) - You okay ? - ( Helena grunts ) - We are gonna do this . - ( Groans ) We 're gonna do it , all right ? You let me help my sister , she needs me . ( John ) I know . That 's part of a problem with twins . You really only need one of them . ( John grunts ) ( Sighs ) - ( John groaning ) - ( Sarah struggling ) ( John groaning ) ( Breathing heavily ) ( Sarah coughs ) ( Gasping ) Lucky shot for a mutation . ( Sarah ) Yeah . I survived you . We survived you . Me and my sisters together . ( Breathing heavily ) This is evolution . I made you . I don 't deny , even as my biggest mistake , you 're my biggest success . I live on in your daughter . You 'll remember me . Ah ! Shut up ! ( Breathing heavily ) It 's a woman 's choice . It 's the most personal one you can make . Well , I 've made my decision then . What , whatever it is , I just , I really ... I really want you to just think it through . Yeah , I 'm gonna keep it . That 's my decision . - ( Art ) Stay with me , okay ? - ( Helena grunting ) Sarah , it 's you . This is happening fast and it 's happening right now . - We need you . - Holy shit . - We need your help , okay ? - Okay . - ( Sighs ) Okay . - ( Art ) Okay , Helena . - I got gloves in the bag , okay . - Yeah .

( Baby crying ) ( Laughs ) - ( Art laughing ) - ( Laughing ) ( Baby crying ) ( Helena exclaims ) Ooh ! ( Baby coos ) Who 's that ? ( Sarah ) Uh , so , I used Pythagora ... Thing . Pythagorean theorem , yeah , exactly . - ( Sarah ) Okay . - That 's question is always on high school equivalency tests . I used to tutor a lot . - ( Cosima laughs ) - ( Sighs ) You met your match with me . I don 't know what I 'm doing . I don 't know what I 've done wrong . Oh , you 're really close . You just have to remember that when you have the hypotenuse , then you flip the equation . - Mom . - Yeah . Oh shit , your lunch . Um , I 've gotta go , guys . - ( Sarah ) Thanks for your help . - See you tonight . You 'll be great , Sarah . Bye ! Ah , I was meant to go grocery shopping yesterday . You 're gonna have to buy something again . - That 's okay . - No , I 'm an idiot . Felix came home from New York last night , right ?

Ooh , of course , Mr Regional Manager . Concrete floors don 't pour themselves , do they ? Well , I don 't pour them but I do help the clients with the designs . - Right ? Yeah . - Yes , you do . - Yes , he does . - ( Donnie chuckles ) He is all architectural and creative now , isn 't he ? - Yeah . - Hmm . ( Vocalises ) - There we go . - That 's Orange , by the way . Purple is nursing . Okay , when is she gonna name them ? This is getting ridiculous . Well , I kinda like it . Colours are names . What about Violet ? Or Rose ? Or Indigo ? - Does he look like an Indigo to you ? - No . But he does look happy in your arms . Right , buddy ? You gonna throw a great party . ( Orange cooing ) ( Orange coos ) Okay , okay . You can have her back . See you later . ( Chuckles ) It 's okay . What ? What do you want to tell me ?

Hi . How was it ? How was your big New York opening ? - Oh , drunkenly successful . - Hmm . You know . What 's ... What 's the " for sale " sign doing out front ? We talked about that . But we didn 't talk about doing it now . Just be grateful you don 't have to go through all this shit . But I want to go through this stuff . You , you probably just gonna throw it out . Do you even have a plan with Kira ? Do you guys know where you 're gonna live ? We 're kind of looking at it like an adventure . So , we 'll see where we end up when the school year starts . Is this what Kira wants ? ( Groans ) Are you gonna pick her up after school ? Course . Are we gonna put off having this conversation until after you graduate from high school ? Yeah , you arse . You were right . You know . Thank you . ( Mobile phone rings ) ( Sarah over phone ) Oi , Meathead . How are the boys ? - Dangling in their sacks . - ( Babies crying ) Are you coming to baby showers ?

( Groans ) ( Mrs S ) You 've never even taken responsibility for yourself , Sarah . How are you gonna be responsible for two ? ( Sarah ) I don 't know . You said it was my choice , didn 't you ? ( Mrs S ) Yes , but your choice does not a mother make . You need to show me you can be still . And I will be here for you . I will support you , whatever it takes . I don 't need your support . I don 't need nothing from you . ( Woman ) Oh , look at that . It 's a little colourful monkey . - Aw . - Oh , it 's from Cosima . What is ? Oh , he 's got little periodic elements in it .

I respected her so much , you know ? And she taught me how to be brave . I just feel like if I had questioned her more , - or if I could have ... - Seriously . It 's all right . She did what she had to do for this . - You know ? We all did . - Mom ! How was the test ? - ( Sarah ) Yeah . - Yeah , how did it go ? Oh , it 's hard to tell . What do you mean ?

( Baby coos ) ( Baby coughs ) Um , worried about Sarah , she is not mended . Yeah , I get that , too . Oh , are these the old toys you cleaned out of the house ? - Mmm-hmm . - ( Alison ) Oh , thank God . Do you know what Helena gives the twins for toys ? Rocks . - No . - Yeah , no it 's true . I , um ... I had to take them away . ( Sarah ) Christ , serious ? Thank God . She needs a little guidance , so ... If you 're not too busy , now that you 're done your test , it would be nice to see you a little more often . Yeah ? Yeah , where is Meathead ? Uh , she 's putting the boys to bed . - ( Exclaims ) - Hey . - ( Sarah chuckles ) You good ? - ( Art laughs ) - ( Art ) How you doing , sestra ? - I 'm good . No , you 're not . - Alison ... - Well , what is this we hear about a " for sale " sign on the front lawn ? You knew we were thinking about that . Play dates , the kids . Gemma , Kira , Charlotte , Maya , they 're all bonding . They like each other . ( Donnie ) Ali , Ali ... ( Alison ) You know , they 're having fun ... What ? What ? This is what we fought for , right ? To be sisters . - It 's a good thing . - ( Sarah ) Yeah . It 's good . We just need a change . Freedom looks different to everyone . Honey , we feel your loss . But Kira has cousins now . She has a stable home ... In the house where her grandmother was shot dead ! Alison , take a bloody cue for once ! ( Sarah ) Sorry . Sorry . Is it cool if I chill with you ? Sarah , I 'm so sorry . I didn 't mean to be ... Um , doesn 't matter . ( Takes deep breath ) ( Exhales ) Rachel . Felix . You 're looking well . Who 's this then ? Got a new man servant already ? This is Yusef , my Uber driver . Oh . ( Chuckles ) So , when I chant " we are the 99 % " , it now includes you . I have a glass eye , no friends , and no identity unless I want to be found . Leaves little room for elitism . Here you are . - Hey , bub . - Come . ( Alison ) Sit . What is going on ? I didn 't go to my test . That 's good , isn 't it ? Lying to my own kid . Same shit . ( Voice breaks ) I don 't know what I 'm doing . I ... I carry around all of these mistakes ... ( Sighs ) I don 't know how to be happy . ( Sniffles ) There 's no one left to fight , and I 'm still a shit mum . ( Sniffles ) ( Sarah cries ) You know the other day , Gemma was driving me so crazy . I screamed at her , I said , " If you don 't clean up your room , I am going to string you up by your thumbs and stuff your dirty damn sock balls in your mouth . " And I meant it . I scared her . Every time I look , the baby 's eating sand . I turn around , sand . Where does this sand come from ? I don 't know . So , I let them eat it . - ( Alison ) What ? - ( Helena laughs ) Did you guys see how panicked I got when Felix handed me the baby earlier ? Like , I am just not maternal at all . ( Chuckles ) And that makes me wonder like , am I ... selfish or am I scared ? You know ? We 're all scared ... Sarah . Yes , and we all make mistakes . God , I was a drug dealer , for Pete 's sake . ( Takes deep breath ) ( Exhales ) Thank you . ( Sniffles ) Thank you . - ( Rachel ) How 's the family ? - Happy . They got what you promised . And the babies ? Rachel , you know you can 't come in . Ever since I was six years old , I 've compared myself to each and every LEDA . Believe me , the last thing I want to do is see another face like mine . Have a nice life , Rachel . Don 't you all look cosy . Well , that 's good . 'Cause I 've got something for all of you . What 's that ? ( Felix ) See for yourself . Holy shit , is that ... Complete list of the LEDA sisters . - What ? - ( Felix ) Yeah . Where did you get this ? ( Sarah ) Uh ... I 've got a good guess . " Oxana Petrov , Colista Popoudokis ... " This is ... This is medical histories , physicians , contacts , addresses . This is everything we need to cure the LEDAs . Yeah . ( Sarah ) Christ , that 's ... 274 of us . Oh , God . That is a lot of inoculations . Wow . ( Cosima ) They 're never gonna have to go through everything that we did . I feel dizzy . It is not so much . Enough about them . They have a share for us , too . - ( Sarah ) Is that your memoirs ? - Yes . I finished my book . It 's a story about my sestras . I call it , Orphan Black . - ( Sarah ) Boy , that 's weird . - ( Laughs ) What is ... ( Laughs ) It 's cool . 'Cause we are all orphans , right ? Yeah , that 's what it is . - ( Sarah ) Is that what it is ? - We 're not black . - Are you ... ( Laughs ) - ( Felix laughs ) God . - What does it mean ? - ( Helena ) Shut up . Listen , I will translate from Ukrainian . " My story is an embroidery with many beginnings and no end . But I will start with the thread of my sestra , Sarah , who stepped off a train one day and met herself . " ( Playing piano ) Hey , that sounds nice , honey . Thank you . I like it . ( Laughs ) Not exactly a striptease . Oh , I think it just turned into one . Oh , what 's this ? - ( Salsa music playing ) - Oh , I like it . - Oh ! - Whoops ! ( Alison laughs ) I love you . I love you . Yes , snap it . Snap those fingers . ( Camilla speaking Spanish ) I feel so blessed . How can I thank you ? ( In Spanish ) Have you been to Cartagena before ? ( In Spanish ) No , it 's our first time . ( In Spanish ) Please , you must go to my favourite restaurant . La Garza . ( In Spanish ) It 's only a short walk . ( In Spanish ) Best fried fish and coconut rice in the world . ( In Spanish ) La Garza . We will . ( In Spanish ) Tell them you 're a friend of Camilla . ( In Spanish ) Thank you . ( In Spanish ) You can thank some very determined women . Did Camilla Torres just ask you to dinner ? - Maybe . - Uh-huh . Okay , well , we first have to go to Brazil 'cause there 's 14 more of us there . Do you know my Portuguese is terrible ? ( Babies cooing ) Little Purple . Little Orange . It 's time for you to take the names of real men . ( Purple crying ) Oh , what 's wrong ? Ooh ... ( Exclaiming ) ( Vocalising ) ( Blows raspberries ) Okay ! Let 's go , you guys . - You ready ? - ( Felix ) Yes . Felix , you got the food ? Seven cold beer and a pork pie . Nice , okay . You 're joining them . Where 's my fishing rod ? ( Sarah ) Huh ? Here . Darling , how many times do I have to tell you there are no fish at Shite Beach . Mmm-hmm , there are . Yeah , there are . There are shite fish . ( Kira ) Mmm-hmm , and they 're gonna eat you up .

Who the fuck are you ? you got some buckshot in your door . I heard you was in Phoenix . some friends of mine in Texas HP called and told me they found three dead cholos in a pullout on 54 . I know . another one a leg . So they was thinking it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger . But neither one of them can drive ... the other one extinct . And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a ' 24 Chrysler ... well this is a ' 24 Chrysler . She found you yet ? Gabriela ? See ... Wolvie . not really . I 'm looking for someone who 's looking for you . She took something of mine when I wasn 't looking . Something for which I am responsible . Mexican lady . Has her sights on you now . Doesn 't ring any bells ? so get the fuck out of my car . Oh . You know ... amigo . The old cue ball south of the border . What do you want ? A little co-operation . by the way . fuck ! no . but I need the boat now . Why would that mean the price go up ? Listen to me .

Won 't see us through the week . I 'm working on it . Your turn . I 've had a rough night . Poor you . he told me last night he 's communicating with someone . He 's not talking to anybody . Don 't be so sure . He 's got all these details . I thought that tank was supposed to act as a barrier . It 's got them cracks in it . Just please stop . Bottom left . You 're not listening . He 's been asking questions again about why we 're here . I think he 's trying to read my mind . That 's what these are for . { \ i1 \ cH80ffff } Eating his curds and whey { \ i1 \ cH80ffff } Then came a big spider which sat down beside her ... { \ i1 \ cH80ffff } And frightened Miss Muffet ... I have good news for you today ! It 's not about what you do . It 's not about your deeds . You can 't live up to God 's rules . we 're imperfect . sir . I said make way ! The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell ! Get it with chicken ! Get it with steak ! And with the cheese baked right in the shell it 's the next big thing ! Go now while supplies last . Who are you ? You know who I am . You 're the man who puts me to sleep . We both could use some sleep . No ! No ! What are you doing to me ? Charles . now . How long have I been here ? What are these ? You remember what they are . The shots mellow the seizures . The pills keep them from happening . How about you blow on them to make them safe ? Logan . So you remember who I am now . I always know who you are . It 's just sometimes I don 't recognize you . Take the pills . You leave me alone with that fucking albino . He doesn 't listen to me . I know a damn speciation when I see one . A what ? a young one . There are forces trying to kill them . Forces ? They want help . forces . It 's too bad you 're not in that business anymore . they want you . that 's how fucking stupid they are . They 're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty . a long time . There are no new mutants . Understand ? Hasn 't been a new one born in 25 years . Not anywhere . You always thought we were part of God 's plan . But maybe ... Maybe we were God 's mistake . What a disappointment you are . When I found you you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter . A warm capper to a life as an assassin . Hooked on barbiturates . You were an animal . But we took you in . I gave you a family . And they 're gone now . Logan . What did you do ? What did you do ? Answer me ! Why are we here ? No one should live like this . Drugged in a fucking tank ! It 's for your own good . it 's not ! You 're waiting for me to die . I don 't wanna fight but there 's things we need to discuss . What things ? would it be considered nagging if I was to repeat my previous observation that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures ? It 's what the guy gave me . Wasn 't in a position to make demands . I almost died this morning . That seizure was ... It was barely a minute . It felt a lot longer than a minute . I couldn 't breathe . You 're less affected . You know he needs a higher dose . And I know you got more money squirreled away . That money 's to get us out of here . not us . You and him . You 're saving to buy a Sunseeker . Sun " is the keyword . I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu . Do you ? and making him spotted dick . Found this in your pocket . Adamantium . If you are planning to blow your brains out ... .. could you wait till you 're out on the high seas ? I just mopped these floors . I don 't need this shit . you asked me to help you . And God knows I 've tried . not really if you 're not going to talk to me . I hear you at night . You 're not sleeping . You don 't wanna talk about that . Or the booze you 're drinking . Or the pus you 're wiping away from your knuckles . Or the blood I wash from your clothes . Or the fresh wounds in your chest . The ones that aren 't healing . And I 'm pretty sure you don 't wanna talk about the fact that you can 't read the label on that bottle . Ibuprofen . That was my favorite mug . Stay out of my shit . Logan . On the inside you 're sick . I can smell it . { \ i1 \ cH00ffff } Best night ever ! driver . I love you . I love you . You 're such a doll . Mr. Logan . Jesus . Please . We need a ride .

I believe you 're thinking of someone else . Hmm . you used to work for my team . You were helping round up all those old mutes . What changed ? You got religion ? I 'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys and track one more special mute for me . I 'm not helping you . you 'd say that . But I got a theory that people don 't really change . Beware of the light . I bet that 's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid . Beware of the light . let 's not bring out the worst in each other . trust me .

I can 't thank you enough for this . it was great . so ... don 't you ? we 'll find a motel somewhere . The nearest one is two hours from here and it 's not even that nice . We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and ... you can sleep in the living room on the convertible . but we really should go . We can leave early in the morning . as it were . Pop ? Okay . Sit . you want some dessert ? and hardly any sleep . I 'm fucking 90 . that 's 101 reasons to keep moving . Logan . then what ?

Her nurse got it from a comic book . You understand ? It 's not real . It is for Laura . It is for Laura . Get some rest . except for us . they tried eminent domain then screwing with our water . somebody poisoned our dogs . those trucks ... Who knows . Maybe . look at ' em . Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains shucking their cloned-up super corn . too . Why do people eat it ? They don 't . They drink it . Corn syrup . It 's in those drinks that everyone 's having ... whatever . Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day . Mine still are . Those are for breakaway roping . Those are for barrel racing and right here is for pole bending . third place . but my dad makes me . Do you want to listen ?

I 've remembered what happened in Westchester . This is not the first time I 've hurt people . I didn 't know . You wouldn 't tell me . So we just kept on running away from it . I think I finally understand you . Logan ... He 's fantastic . You said you only needed the girl ! I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear . Your friends had every chance . And so did you . Nate ? Put her down . Honey . Will ! Stop ! Kathryn ! Kathryn ! Kathryn ! Charles ! Charles ! Hold this . It wasn 't me . It wasn 't me . Here he comes . meet him halfway . no .

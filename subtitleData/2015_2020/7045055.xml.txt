 Our country is ablaze . If only our ancestors could see the chaos of modern America . Cities are overrun with foreign nationals and the causalities of corporate dictatorship . While our greedy politicians do nothing , the feckless fiddle while America burns . Time 's up , patriots . The great American experiment has failed . But out of the ashes we start anew . Hello , there . My name is Jeremiah Otto . And this is the end of the world as we know it . The only way to protect your family is to be prepared . There you go . The best way to ready yourself is with my four-part video series , How to Survive TEOTWAWKI : The End of the World as We Know It . After decades of running my own cattle ranch and living off the land , I 've developed this proprietary system for surviving T.E. My series will teach you how to stockpile food , ammo , tools , medical supplies , and barter goods . How to recycle water , dig a well , grow crops , and raise livestock . And most importantly , I 'll teach you how to defend your sovereignty against the urban hoards who will want what 's yours when those Four Horsemen ride . So if you call now to get my tapes , I will toss in this survival starter bucket , which includes iodine pills , a hatchet , a compass , and a pocket constitution . All of this at no extra cost . So don 't be a Pollyanna . If you 're gonna plan for a future ... Plan for a better one . I was in the dining room dry-canning some beans when an angel fell from the damn sky and crashed in my backyard . I screamed and ran out there . And there she was , all of 12 , a lump on the ground , holding on to a giant lawn umbrella . She had jumped off the roof . Thought the thing would hold her . She broke her arm in two places , but she never cried . Charlene embodied the spirit of this place ... An always-ready , never-quit , get-it-right-this-time spirit . And she would have ... if she wasn 't risking her life for the unprepared . Pat , thank you . Hello . I just want to introduce my family . I 'm Madison Clark , and these are my children , Nick and Alicia . We wanted to offer our condolences for Charlene and for the others you lost . We 've lost loved ones , too . Travis . Travis , he was our compass , and he ... We just wanted to say thank you for sheltering us and thank you for your generosity . We will repay it . Thank you . We 've all lost . We share that . And grieving 's hard , but it 's important that we process it ... More important to prepare , Jake . - Good point ! - I 'm sorry . There is a time and place for mourning , and Patty is owed that . But who brought down the helicopter ? - We aim to find out , Vernon . - When ? - We 're gonna get to the bottom of this . - What 's your timeline ? - Jeremiah , please . - Nothing 's changed , Vernon . Make no mistake , we 're in a wartime posture here . We tasked Alpha Station to scout the crash site . When we know what we 're dealing with , we 'll act . If it 's some wing nut , we 'll act . If it 's a larger challenge , we will act . Payback , Vernon . Yeah ! That 's what my father means . Whatever this threat is , large or small , we will make this right . Hey , we 'll mete out justice when we know what it is we 're dealing with . We can 't afford to lose ourselves . We 're more than a mob . We have to be something hopeful in this world . Like my father says , if you plan for the future ... Plan for a better one . Freeloader . Excuse me ? You know the fable " The Ant and the Grasshopper " ? Hey , what 's your problem ? Let it go . Let it go . They should be harassing Troy , not us . I think they would be if they knew what he had done . Madison and Alicia , I 'm Gretchen Trimbol , Vernon 's daughter . Saw you at the meeting . Welcome . I 'd shake , but it wouldn 't be sanitary . Damn hangnail can take you down these days , you 're not careful , you know ? I 'm so sorry for your loss . I wish I 'd have had the pleasure of knowing Travis . Thank you , Gretchen . Hey , Alicia , the rest of Christ Rizen and I were wondering if you wanted to join us for Bible study . - Oh , we 're not really ... - When is it ? Tonight . One hour , two , tops . Music , punch , and the Lord , of course . - What , uh , is Christ Rizen ? - Oh , sorry . Christ Rizen is our band . That 's Terry and Gabe . - You 'll meet Geoff if you come . - We 're Jewish . Cool . We 'll do Old Testament . Corral at 5 : 00 . We need supplies , Nick . Water , weapons . We must be ready to leave . They 're going to take the cuffs off soon . You can walk around and see the place . No . Eat , Luciana . I can 't forget what they did . I know . As soon as they free me , we go . I just want us all to feel safe in one place . I had a chance to make that happen . I had a chance to kill him . But ... That would not have made us safe . And you know this . This is not you , Nick . You 're not a killer . How 's Luciana ? Oh , still alive . I liked your speech . I liked how you said his name . Travis . It makes him matter . Makes him real . He was real . That 's not why you said it , though . It wasn 't out of grief . It was pointed . You wanted to remind us that you 're a victim , too . You feel like a victim ? Are you analyzing me now ? No . What did you do in the old world ? Guidance counselor . At a high school ? Oh . I never attended . " Certain social aspects of academia proved challenging for Troy . " You must have been lonely . No , no . No , I , uh ... I had this place . Everything that I do is in service to this place . Does your father believe that ? Yeah , he understands . You know , complicated problems call for complicated solutions . Killing people 's not complicated . It 's simple . Do you see ? You understand this world . You understand me . That 's why I picked you . But I didn 't ... I didn 't pick Nick . He comes with me . Package deal . Why were you separated ? Why was he with strangers and not his family ? He doesn 't deserve his place here . I think you know it . He 'll earn it . That was made this morning , Troy . Hey , hey , hey , hey , Dante 's not gonna be happy ... Hey ! Hey , you 're making a mistake . Huh ? ! You 're making a mistake ! This is a mistake ! Victor ... Don 't . - They don 't want us here . - Most of them don 't mind . The ones who do , we win them over . - You want to win over Troy ? - Work in progress . In the meantime , both of you stay away from him . Not sure I can do that . The hell you can 't , Nick . You don 't know what sets him off . He doesn 't know what sets him off . Okay , but if we stay , we need to do something . What does that mean ? I 'm doing something . No , what do you mean , Nick ? What are you gonna do ? Do you want my knife ? - You gonna do something ? - All I 'm saying is that ... we should start over somewhere else , okay ? Like find a house , grow crops . We don 't have to stay here , that 's all . - Farming 's more your style . - We have options . - We 're not leaving . - Why ? - We 're not leaving ! - Why are you so convinced that this is the place , Mom ? Because it 's all we have . Because there 's no place better . Because we hauled you out of that hell hole and Travis died because of it . Luciana won 't be safe here . They let her in . What if they make her go ? You 'll have a choice to make . Something 's wrong . That 's not many klicks for McCarthy to cover . We should have heard back by now . How many times did you and Charlie fly that route ? Six times in four weeks , maybe . People tend to knock before they enter . Or is this different back in Angel City ? Front door was open . What do you need , Madison ? Reassurance . You took us in and I thank you for that , but ... And you are welcome . But some people here resent us . Well , that 's natural . You are strangers . We 're not strangers to Troy . What did he do ? Broke into our place , threatened Nick . I 'd like you to keep a leash on your son . And I 'd like you to help us with the other people . The ranch ain 't my autocratic plaything . Its residents don 't bend to my whims and wills and fancies . It 's a place for free people who only ask for help when they need it . I 'm asking . I need it . You a hard woman to like , Madison ? I 'm extremely goddamn hard to like when someone threatens my family , and that 's what Troy did . That 's fact . If Jake hadn 't shown up at the depot , we 'd be dead . That 's fact . And it 's something no one here seems to give a shit about . Whoa , whoa , whoa . No need to curse . He murdered people , and he called it science . Maybe the ranch should know that . Yeah , I 'm starting to grasp why folks ' fondness fails when it comes to you , Madison . - Dad , she 's justified ... - Uh ... If my people take umbrage at your presence , that 's on you . I won 't let anyone drown without teaching them how to swim . Jake , show her the lectures . Did Troy hurt you ? Has he always been this way ? I 'll take care of him . Okay . Yeah , you and your dad keep saying that . Thank you ... for saving Alicia . Well , she saved me , too . She ... All right , I 'm going to put on some coffee . You 're going to need it . You worried about the helicopter ? Nah . It 'll turn out to be some crackpot scavenger . Whoever it is , I want to meet him . Our country is ablaze . If only our ancestors can see the chaos of modern America . You gonna ride ? Dad used to take me to the equestrian center . No , I 'm not riding . I 'm waiting for Gretchen . Going to her first Bible study . We stay , we should get to know them . You 're invited . So ... is that what you want ? You want to stay ? No . But I 've seen what it 's like out there , and it 's all just different circles of hell . Why not this one ? Sorry what Mom said . It wasn 't fair . It 's not wrong . Bad time to form a conscience . What happened to you out there ? The boar 's back . Keeps digging up the fence posts to get to the cabbage . Could use an extra pair of hands tracking it tonight . Stay away from Madison and her family . They 're my friends . They came here under my invite . They trust me . They came here not to get eaten . I wouldn 't flatter yourself . Yeah , but they 're staying 'cause I said I 'd protect them from you . And how are you going to do that ? Please don 't do this . Troy , please . I 'm the one that still believes in you . Well , I don 't need you to anymore . Yeah , you do . You do . If the ranch knew what you really are ... And what am I , Jake ? Do you really think that you were helping those people out at the depot ? I think I was helping all of us . Troy ... when Dad 's gone , this is all on us . We have to take care of this place . We have to lead ... - Together . - Yeah . But I need you to do something for me . I need you to stay away from the Clarks . - Do you hear me ? - Yep . I hear you . Do you mean it ? I always mean it , Jake . How much further ? We 're here . You first . All right , everybody . Get your study materials . Greens to the new girl . She is one of God 's chosen people . - This is not what I expected . Go your way . Eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a merry heart , for God has already accepted your works . You have turned my mourning into dancing . You 've removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness . You said " sackcloth . " " We Can Be Heroes " playing So , where is Geoff ? Say hi , Geoff . If you 're gonna plan for the future ... Plan for a better one . Cut it . I look like an asshole out there . I didn 't know what the hell I was saying . I told you to use the cue cards . I don 't need goddamn cue cards . - I know my lines , okay ? - Okay . Now , what I want you to do is pick up that sniveling idiot . Why don 't you pick him up ? I 'm going back to the house . - No , you 're staying right here . - Hey ! You 're staying right here . We 're gonna do another . - You hear me ? - Enough ! It isn 't enough . It 's enough when I say it 's enough . - I 'm tired ! - You 're not tired . You 're thirsty , that 's what you are . - You 're goddamn thirsty . - You 're hurting me ! Jake , tend to your brother . Let 's do this again , okay ? - One more take . We 'll do it again . - Sorry , no . - See what you started ? - Jeremiah , let her go . Why don 't you just shut up , okay ? Just shut your damn mouth . Not my finest moment . How far did you get ? I didn 't get through the first tape . It 's funny , where we start and where we end up . What happened to their mom ? Troy 's mom . Jake 's was my first wife . I was married twice before I gave up the sacred institution . Did she die ? Yeah . Before . My father was a drunk , like her . The booze kill him ? In a way , yeah . Drink took Tracy . Got real ugly at the end . Troy tended to her , and ... fed her and cleaned her . She hated him for it . Where were you ? Selling buckets . I suffered the same affliction . No , no , no , no . It was the night before we signed the paperwork for the Fortuna Resort . I 'm positive . It was that night , because we were never sure we were gonna close the deal . Thomas 's counter was aggressive . Either way , the sun had come up , and you and Thomas were making crepes chocolates on a bonfire of God knows what . It was the wood case of the Vino Hormaechea ' 89 . And all the while I was singing Juan Gabriel to a cactus . Yeah , that 's right . Oh , man . I 'm ... I 'm assuming ... Thomas did not ... ? Huh . So , you escaped this hotel in this crazy woman 's car , and all you have with you are your wits and charms and this crunchy suede coat ? Don 't forget my good looks , Dante . Well , it 's nice to be back with a like mind . - Salud . - Salud . He wants to know where you 're from . El Sereno , Los Angeles , California , America , North America , Earth . Geoff wants to know what it 's like out there . Chaos . Ruin . And it changes you . Not like Geoff . Something worse . Can I ask Geoff something ? Sure . Who are the Ottos ? Our founding family . They made this place before most of us were even born . Jeremiah saw what was coming . And how long you guys been here ? It varies . Most came when the Event began . Geoff showed up a week after T.E. He was the first one we saw like that ... Dead alive . Geoff claims he 's from Flagstaff , but I doubt it . He 's indifferent on the Ottos , except Troy . Geoff is not a fan . Troy took Geoff 's body . Troy 's done a lot worse than that . Troy and the militia do what we can 't . They protect us . You can 't rely on the Troys of the world . Not anymore . We 've been behind the fence since this started , Alicia . We can 't do what he does . Sometimes you have to handle your own shit . Geoff wants to know what bad stuff have you done out there ? I killed a man . How did it feel ? Easy . ¿ Qué ? This man was cartel before the fall . His function was to take from honest people and to kill those who refused . Which he did . See , in my world now , there is no room for such people . No , no , no , no . Hey ! Hey ... Dime ... did you truly think that we were friends in the old world ? We made each other money . That 's very American of you , Victor . I know why you 're here . It 's why you were always here . You want what is not yours . You wanted my people 's land , and now you want my water . Everyone wants your water . Not everyone is quite as thirsty as you . I 'm not here to take from you . Some food , shelter , a cocktail , perhaps . - That would suffice . - No , no , no . Nothing suffices . Nothing satiates . You cannot help your need to take . It is in your nature . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! You need me , Dante ! You need me ! Hold it . ¿ Cómo ? You 're begging for an attack . You can 't sell so close to your source . It 's only a matter of time before they try to take it , not me . - Oh , you wish to serve me ? - Yes , I wish to serve . - You wish to advise me ? - Yes , please . Listen to me . You must sell off-site . And for that , you need transport . Guns and more men and ammunition to guard that transport . I can organize that . Water is the currency now . How could I ever trust a thief ? I never stole from you . You stole from Thomas . We can work this out . Did ... did Thomas die believing that you loved him ? I did love him . You will say anything . Aah ! No , please ! Please ! No ! Why are you doing this ? So you suffer . You exploit everything that you touch . And for that , you owe a debt . You will work it off . You will feel just like the people that you 've taken from . You will feel powerless . " Once in a While " playing in background A bunch of us are going hunting . You can join if you 're not too busy watching old folks bone . Middle of the night ? Boars are nocturnal . Catch them sneaking around in the dark . Nah , I don 't hunt . This is more ... it 's more maintenance than hunting . More cultivating than killing . Come . Earn your keep . Evening . Jake tells me your son went out on that boar hunt . Nick doesn 't hunt . He 's a city kid . You don 't have guns in the city ? Not in my house , no . Now ? Now 's now . How long does this hunt normally last ? Well , it varies . A couple hours , all night . Boys are fierce creatures . They 'll come back safe . Alicia must have read the entire Book of Moses by now . Some mothers might be happy . My daughter 's finding God ? Finding place . They never had that . Place . Nick 's an addict . Spent the last five years waiting on a call from the morgue . Today I told him if he left , I 'd let him go . But here you are . Here I am . Things we do to our children . And the things we do for them to make up for it . You want to know why I tolerate my son ? Come on , take a walk . Such ! Such . Such . Such . Such . Such . - Fass , fass , fass , fass ! - Go , go ! - Hey ! - Go , go , go , go ! Move ! Where are we going ? Underneath my house . My tapes didn 't make me the lightning rod I hoped to be , but enough people woke , invested in the vision . We call this the pantry . Some say this mess we 're in is Revelations , God 's vengeance . I 'll tell you what it is . It 's an opportunity . A new life . A chance to make amends . I broke Troy in that old world . In this one , he has a purpose . We all do . And nothing heals a family more than that . We will build something better than before . It won 't be easy , Madison . You think your family 's up for it ? Absolutely . The ground 's soft . You could dig a grave real easy . I mean , people would suspect you , but ... well , they really wouldn 't know for sure . I wonder how long it 'll take you to turn . Eighty-seven minutes . Eighty-seven minutes given my weight , BMI , age . You know , if you do do it , you should time it . Journal 's in my pocket . You are not a scientist . Time it . Nick ... please . What is wrong with you ? Newton stabbed his own eye to understand the nature of light . I just ... I need to know . I need to know why we spoil . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! I think we can be friends now . You should be sleeping . How 's your wound ? Better . Thank you . For what ? Waiting for me to heal before we leave . I 'm sorry for Travis . He saved my life . He was a good man . A much better person than I am . He saved us . We 're not going to throw that away , are we ? We survive now ... at all costs . Turning water into wine ? Praise Jesus . Everybody , listen up , please . I just got updated on Outpost Alpha . McCarthy and his unit went out 36 hours ago , and we ain 't heard nothing back . Could mean a hundred things , 99 of them benign . But we always got to prepare for the one-off . Troy here is gonna take a party out , but we 're gonna need volunteers . Blake . Mike . Coop . Jimmy . And Madison Clark . All right , everybody , enjoy your meal . Your kids are over there . I know . I knew you would drink it all . I told you I 'd be your guardian angel .

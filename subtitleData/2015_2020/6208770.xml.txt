 [ Pat ] Our cousin Annie needs help . - [ groaning ] - [ Wiley ] What happened ? [ Pat ] She cut her leg and it went from bad to worse . Without antibiotics , she 'll die . Why do you need me ? [ Pat ] At this point , any Creeker who tries to show his or her face in town is risking getting shot at . You 're one of them . Okay . Try to get Rifampin . If you can 't , I wrote down others . - I can take him now . - We don 't think that 's the best idea . You trying to go in and out of town with the baby . You know ... - You 're not asking , are you ? - With what Ronnie tried to do to you , you have more reason to leave and never come back . So Jason is the insurance policy . You 're holding my baby hostage . We 're sorry . [ Wiley ] I thought you two were different . I heard you came looking for me . Sort of . How 's the baby ? Jason 's fine . You named him ? Yeah . It was time to step up my mothering game . Hey , I 'm sorry . Me , too . Okay . So , I have something I need to do right now , but maybe later , if you 're not too busy ... Definitely . I 'll come by your place . I don 't think I can handle too much more of Saint Melissa . Stay as long as you like . See you around . Sure , square . Room 14 . C Block . You getting any texts ? No , nothing . How do we have power but the phones still don 't work ? I don 't know . I don 't think the power going out was an accident . Not if they can turn it back on and keep cell service off . Yeah , you ... [ grunting ] you might be onto something . You okay ? Vince , what 's wrong ? - Vince . - [ retching ] - You seemed so mysterious back in school . - [ chuckles ] - Yeah ? - No , it 's true . Don 't take it the wrong way . It 's just that the whole Mennonite thing ... it just made all of you seem like foreigners . What ? I know . I 'm sorry that sounded kind of prejudiced , but ... it 's just that you all stayed so close together and no one saw you outside of school . Didn 't you ever feel , I don 't know , different ? Not at first , no . Then ... sure . I wondered what it would be like to ride in a car ... wear clothes bought from the Gap , eat McDonald 's , go to regular high school . So ... what 's your plan ? Do you need a ride back to your ... - Community ? - Right , yeah . No . I guess I 'm not getting more of an explanation than that , am I ? Well , if you want ... you can stay here . [ Franny ] Gord ? We have a problem . [ sighs ] [ cows mooing ] Well , obviously , the antibiotics aren 't working . Every last one of them now has mastitis . How bad is it , Gord ? If we can 't get this under control , we lose our only source of milk inside the fence . When we had problems with the animals , my father used a liniment oil . Worked wonders . Even for something like this ? Pretty much for everything . - Worth a try . - [ car horn honking ] Who 's that ? Gord , we , uh ... we need your help . [ sighs ] I 'm dealing with a few things here . It 's Vince . He 's in pretty bad shape . I can drive you to your farm . - You can drive ? - Yeah , ever since the quarantine . [ Gord ] That would help . Okay . [ groaning ] [ breathing heavily ] [ Tracey ] Ronnie ? Ronnie ? - What are you doing ? Stop . - Get out of here . I need that ! No . Maybe some pain will do you some good . - Remind you what you tried to do to Wiley . - [ exhales deeply ] If Mom and Dad could see you now . Well , I guess it 's a good thing that they 're dead . [ whimpers ] What 's wrong with you ? What 's wrong with you , Ronnie ? When did you become a monster ? [ shuddering ] [ Chuck ] You don 't think it 's the virus ? - I hear Ms. Symonds , she- - - Yeah , I know . I thought the government was just being paranoid . I thought we were done with all this virus shit . Apparently not . But Vince doesn 't have it . If he did , he 'd be dead already . Hey , Vin . How you doing , buddy ? I feel like I 'm dying . [ groans ] Tell me where it hurts , okay ? Everywhere . My stomach . If you can 't help me , then shoot me . [ Vince groaning ] Sorry . - Sorry . Just breathe , breathe . - [ vomiting ] [ Vince breathing heavily ] Hey . Hey , buddy . It 's his appendix . My guess , it 's burst . How do you know ? Mine ruptured two years ago . It 's gonna kill him , isn 't it ? There 's nothing we can do . Not without a hospital . Okay , a hospital . - What ? - We get him to a hospital . - Oh , gee , why didn 't I think of that ? - I 'm serious , Gord . We load him up in Ted Metz 's plane and I fly him over the fence myself . Chuck , that 's way too dangerous . It can 't be that hard . It 's suicide . [ Kevin ] I know how to fly . My grandfather , he , uh ... he gave me a few lessons . I 'll take him . Are you sure ? Yeah . No shit . [ alarm beeping ] [ typing ] [ computer chimes ] [ beeping ] [ beeping ] [ door closes and locks ] [ exhales sharply ] Come on . Shit ! [ Gord ] We 'll get you out of here soon . [ Chuck ] You 'll be okay , man . [ Gord ] Okay . [ Chuck ] Okay . What the hell are you doing here ? What happened ? Please tell me it 's not the virus again . No . No , we think his appendix burst . Where you been ? Your sister 's worried . Around . Taking a break from things . Oh , yeah ? Rumor has it you 're staying out at the Creekers ' . Yeah , sort of , I guess . Seriously , Wiley ? It 's only temporary . I 'm leaving as soon as I get them some medicine . Excuse me ? Ever since you shot at Pat , they don 't exactly feel welcome in town . So they sent me . I just need some antibiotics . Yeah , not from here . Come on . There 's a little girl with a leg so swollen , she might die . Oh , yeah ? And Ronnie has come in here and pretty much helped himself to whatever he pleased . The Creekers aren 't getting another thing . - You don 't know it was Ronnie . - [ Gord ] It 's true , Wiley . The other day , when I caught him stealing , his bag was full of pills . [ scoffs ] - Well , I swear this is not for him . - [ Chuck ] Vince needs Oxy . Oxy that Ronnie is pretty much baked on . So you tell him to come here and return what he stole , and then maybe we 'll discuss it . [ sighs ] All right . Come on . [ Amanda ] Come and get it , Jack ! Jack ? [ sighs ] Jack ! Come on , boy ! Jack ! Jack ! Jack ! Chuck , I know how you feel . He 's like a ... a brother to you . But even with the remote possibility that Kevin can fly the plane , which I seriously doubt , who 's to say that they won 't get shot out of the sky ? Come on , what sort of conspiracy theories are you smoking , Gord ? Besides , you have a better idea ? Let Vince die ? You know how much pain he 's in . So what ? We 're just gonna stand there and watch him suffer ? It 's a death wish . No , it is actually doing something . What is your solution ? [ sighs ] Thought so . Go back to your farm , Gord . It was a mistake sending for you in the first place . [ Jason crying ] - [ continues crying ] - No , it 's okay . Oh , baby . It 's okay . [ shushes ] It 's all right . [ Ronnie ] Shit . There you go . It 's okay , baby . - Oh , there 's a smile . - [ door closes ] Ronnie ? It 's okay . [ shushes ] It 's okay . Do you need any help ? No , I 'm fine . You should 've stayed in the truck . - I thought something happened to you . - [ horse snorts ] - You said you 'd be right back . - Okay . - What 's going on ? - [ shushes ] Get down . [ man ] Morning , John ! I got it . What happens if they catch us stealing ? We 're not stealing . This is mine . Okay , he 's clear . Let 's go . [ Melissa ] The Creekers ? I could go down there again , talk to her . Maybe she 'll come back . No . Either she 'll get it or she won 't . I should 've just kept my mouth shut . I miss the baby . None of this is working . - Hey , Mel . Easy . - [ sighs ] You 're one of the good ones . You really think so ? Definitely . Just look at all the things you 're doing with the kids . I should go . [ sighs ] You sure ? Yeah . [ sobbing ] [ toilet flushing ] [ knocks on door ] You okay in there ? I need help . [ gasps ] Please . Hey ! That 's my dog ! [ dog whines ] - It 's okay . Here . - Why do you have my dog ? You know he 's my dog , right ? My address is on the tag . And it also says that his name is Jack and I live at the same address . - So that proves it . - Yeah , it certainly does . I was actually just heading to the address to see if anybody still lived there . I 'm happy I found you ' cause I was worried he was a stray or something . No ! No ! He 's definitely not a stray . Come on , Jack . - Jack escaped . - Really ? He 's not allowed to roam free , or else he 'll be killed . I am supposed to be very careful . - Mmm-hmm . - But sometimes I 'm not so careful . Like this morning , I left the front door open . You won 't tell Chuck , will you ? Chuck ? Chuck 's my brother . He says he 's my father and mother , too , because they died . He makes me hamburgers whenever I want . I can 't make them anymore . Do you have a brother ? Yeah , I do . - What 's his name ? - Harrison . Was that the same Harrison who stole the car ? [ chuckles ] Yeah . I remember you . Chuck says that was wrong . Very wrong . But he was more wrong to Harrison . - Chuck said that ? - Yup . Time to feed Jack . Bye ! [ sighs ] [ moaning ] [ whimpering ] [ Pat ] I 'll give Ronnie credit . Even when he 's trying to do the right thing , he manages to screw it all up . You can 't pin all this on him . For one , he 's an addict . Secondly , I watched him do it . It never occurred to me that flushing the pills would be a problem . Or that Chuck would tell Wiley , " No Oxy , no meds for Annie . " How 's Annie ? Her fever 's getting higher . Wiley and I will go back into town tonight . Why not just sneak into town by yourself , get the drugs ? Forget about Wiley altogether . You don 't need her . Look , she 's our insurance policy in case things go sideways . Rumor has it , Chuck has half the hockey team armed . Are you saying what I think you 're saying ? I doubt it 'll come to that . If it does ? If I get caught , you think anyone 's gonna bother asking questions first ? At least Wiley 'll buy me some negotiating power . [ sighing ] You okay , Kev ? You sure about this ? Yeah . Yeah , I just , uh ... Just give me a second . You don 't have to do this , you know . I 'm fine , Chuck . This 'll work . Yeah . When you make it across ... remind the world about us . [ sighs ] Okay , Vince ... here we go . Just hang in there , buddy . [ plane engine starting ] [ Jason whining ] [ shushing ] Going somewhere ? [ breathing heavily ] You scared me . You still didn 't answer the question . I ... I just wanted to get some fresh air . It doesn 't look like that to me . Please , let me go . Here , take these . Annie still needs the drugs whether you stay or you go . [ Chuck ] They can 't do that . Just shoot the plane down . It wasn 't even close to the border . [ Gord ] I warned you this would happen ! - Not now , Gord . - So when , Chuck ? Yesterday , you almost killed a guy by stringing him up . And today ... These deaths are on your head . You go to hell ! At least I make decisions around here instead of hiding at my farm at the first sign of trouble . Right . That 's why I got shot at the Creekers ' , huh ? Just because you show up once doesn 't mean you 're all in , Gord . I am trying to make it work ... and you 're just tearing it down ! Maybe it 's time for someone else to make the tough decisions around here . Not just the rich kid . Well , it 's not gonna be the pig farmer . They 're cows , junior . Same pile of shit . Time to leave , Chuck . Go back to the mansion . Make me . [ grunts ] [ both grunting ] [ both panting ] Go home , Gord . [ groaning ] [ sighs ] [ brakes squealing ] Damn it . Damn it . [ groans ] Damn it ! [ engine revving ] - Where 's the car ? - [ inhales sharply ] Wiley took it . What ? Why didn 't you stop her ? - [ car approaching ] - Because I knew she 'd come back . She was never gonna let a little girl suffer . [ Pat sighs ] Frances said you were in here . That bad , huh ? How 's the other guy ? Better than me . I , uh ... was never much of a fighter . How did your parents die ? Just like everybody else 's , I suppose . It was quick . My father couldn 't wait for that . He hung himself . Didn 't leave a note . Didn 't say goodbye . Sit down . [ groans ] [ Mark ] You 're the one that runs the orphanage , right ? Uh , yeah . Kids are down for the night . - Can I get a beer ? - You don 't seem like the drinking type . It 's been a long couple of weeks . Sure . It 's on the house . [ sighs ] Hey , Chuck . You want to play Crazy Eights ? Amanda , not now . Okay . When ? Later . - What time later ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . Later , okay ? 9 : 25 later ? Sure . If that doesn 't work , 9 : 30 or 9 : 45 ? Yeah , sure , whatever . Well ? Which one ? Amanda , honestly , it doesn 't matter , okay ? I don 't care . Chuck ! It 's important to care of a time . Well , which one ? Amanda , stop being a baby ! You stop being a baby , too ! [ door slams ] [ cocks gun ] Please , don 't shoot ! What are you doing here ? Nothing . This is the last place you should be . Okay , then I 'll just leave . You 're not going anywhere , Adam . Open the knapsack . Slowly . [ metal squealing ] [ Ellen grunts ] - Another ? - Uh , no . I gotta pick up some stuff for the kids at the pharmacy . Oh , come on . Have one more . - Nah , you should stay . - Hey . Whoa , whoa . I didn 't mean anything . I 'm sorry . I just ... I really enjoyed talking to you . You 're different in a good way . Uh , yeah . Just- - I should go . [ sighing ] There 's no antibiotics . Yeah , I don 't see any either . You think they knew we were coming ? Bingo . [ Melissa ] Wiley . Hey , we got what we came for . Nothing else . It 's stealing . A little girl 's gonna die . Does that not matter to you ? Everyone knows Ronnie stole the drugs . The Creekers don 't need more . That was Ronnie , not the rest of us . We 're not asking . You can stay , Wiley . You don 't have to do this . Yes , I do . And not because I have to , but because I should . [ Jason wailing ] [ Tracey ] As if we don 't have enough trouble without you stirring up more ? [ Pat ] Did you cut off her finger and steal that ring ? [ Gord ] Ronnie here thinks he can steal from people . Come on , Ronnie , people might need those drugs . [ Stacey ] What I have with Chuck is great ... [ Gord ] Take it easy , Ronnie . Use your head . [ Chuck ] Never touch my sister again ! [ Wiley ] The only way you could get a girl is to rape her ! [ Wiley ] Stop it ! Stop it ! [ Ronnie ] You 're not better than me ! [ Jason continues wailing ] Shut up . Shut up ! [ breathing heavily ] Shut up ! [ grunts ] Shut up ! - [ leaves rustling ] - [ barking ] Jack ! [ gunshot ] You think Melissa 's gonna tell anyone ? Uh , I don 't know . - No . - Yeah , I hope not . It 'll just stir the pot more . - Jack ! - [ barking ] Ronnie 's such an idiot . None of this would 've happened - if it wasn 't for- - - Watch out ! [ brakes screeching ] [ panting ] Amanda ! Ugh ! Help ! [ exhales sharply ] Help me ! She just ran into the road . I didn 't see her . Yeah , I know , I know , I know . Where 'd she come from ? She didn 't see the car ? I don 't know ! Amanda , come on ! Amanda ! [ Gord ] So , I think we stay here from now on . Take care of the farm . Stay out of town . That sounds like a good idea . - What about milk deliveries ? - They can come to us . - But , Gord- - - I 'm done , Franny . There 's no talking any sense into Chuck . And the Creekers ? They- - Look , if they wanna kill each other , fine . But I don 't want any of us hurt because of it . We have more than enough supplies to last . Let 's eat . [ Wiley panting ] She 's dead . What are we gonna do ? We have to leave . No ... No , we have to stay . We have to tell them the truth . Chuck 's already shot at me once . We just killed his sister , all right ? He 's not gonna wait around to talk . Well , I 'll talk to him , okay ? He 'll listen to me ! No , he won 't . All right , someone 's bound to come any minute . There 's nothing we can do for her right now . And trust me , if they find us here , we 're dead . [ groans ] Damn it ! Come on . I 'm sorry . [ doorbell rings ] Hi . Hi . Are you okay ? Yeah , yeah . [ chuckles ] You know , you 're the last person I expected to see . Yeah ... I ... [ sighs ] I wanted to explain to you that ... when I finally got Harrison to tell me exactly what happened , I figured out that things weren 't quite as black and white as they seemed . And I can tell that things went downhill pretty quickly . [ inhales sharply ] [ stutters ] I don 't know . I ... I guess what I 'm trying to say is that it wasn 't entirely your fault and- - No , no , no . It ... I was an idiot . I mean , you don 't do that to a kid . But I 'm ... I 'm sorry , I ... It wasn 't right . [ chuckles softly ] What ? You passed the test . - Test ? - Yeah . My mom always used to say that if a guy could admit that he was wrong , then ... there 's hope for him . Or something . Wanna come in ? Yeah . Yeah , I ... Okay . - [ chuckles ] - Okay . [ sighs ] [ Melissa gasps ] [ snickers ] Wow . - Must 've been nice , growing up rich . - [ snickers ] I mean , not to sound like a jerk or anything , but ... I never really thought about it . It just ... seemed normal , you know ? Hmm . [ sighs ] I don 't want to do this anymore . What do you mean ? It 's obvious , isn 't it ? I 'm not a leader . Everything I do , I screw up . I almost got your brother killed , and Pat . And if I had listened to Gord , then ... Kevin would still be alive . You know , maybe even Vince . Everything 's going to shit . And it 's pretty clear that I 'm part of the problem . You know , I used to think that just because my father ... owned so much of this town that ... that I should be the one to take charge . And now ... [ panting ] What is it ? [ voice trembling ] It 's Amanda . Hello . Can I help you ? I apologize for the late hour , but you have something that belongs to me . What are you talking about ? The liniment oil ? I 'm not here for the oil . I 'm here for my wife ... Hanna . - [ Jason wailing ] - [ Tracey shushing ] No , it 's okay . [ Ronnie breathing heavily ] Shut that baby up ! Ronnie , what are you doing ? I can 't take this ! Shut it up ! He 's not gonna calm down if you 're yelling , okay ? No , you 're tricking me . It 's a trick . Shut it up ! [ voice trembling ] What 's a trick , Ronnie ? Ronnie , you have to trust me . No , you hit me with a shovel ! I 'm sorry , okay ? [ crying ] Don 't apologize . What 's wrong with me ? Why did I do it ? Just give me the knife , okay ? No . No . Ronnie , no . I 've done such awful things . Ronnie , don 't ! You said yourself , Mom and Dad would be ashamed of me . Right ? [ sobbing ] I 'm not . You 're trying to make it right . That has to count for something . [ sobbing ] I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I 'm sorry . Amanda , I 'm so sorry . Adam . I just want to ask you a few questions . What do you know about Art Carey ? I found a canister on his body . I think it might be involved in the deaths . Whatever this is ... I don 't think it 's natural . I think he made it . You 're a smart kid . Did you tell anyone else about this ? No . But if we do , it may point people in the right direction for a cure . We can expose what Carey was doing . And why would I want to do that ? [ grunts ] I 'm on his side . Please . - [ gunshot ] - [ grunts ] [ shell clatters ] Adam . Dad .

 Previously on " Time After Time " ... Hello , Brooke . It 's me . John brought something back from the island ... Some serum my father made with John 's DNA . Your body 's still processing the serum . What did you give me ? I don 't know how , but it healed me , and I don 't trust Brooke with it . We have to stop her , Vanessa . Griffin ? You believe she plans to sell the serum ? Absolutely . Vanessa , we cannot let her do that . Promise me you will get my journal off this island . You 're the one who gives it to Brooke . I am begging you , please , don 't do this . I helped you . Yes , you did . But he left me to die . Is that true ? He lied to your face . How can you ever trust him again ? All this craziness , it 's too much . It 's time for me to go home . Goodbye , H.G. Adam ? Who 's at the door ? Griffin ? What did you do to me ? You 're going through withdrawal . Make it stop . Take him down to the lab . Achilles ' heel returns . He 's my brother . He tried to kill you ... And vice versa . I can 't keep score . Can you make it stop ? I can give you a maintenance dose that 'll help reduce the symptoms . The question is , why should I ? Because we 're family . Damn it , Griffin . You need to rest . We 'll see how you feel in a few hours . Okay . Are you going to help him ? Maybe . I want to monitor his symptoms first . It 's Griffin . I 'm in . Did she suspect anything ? She doesn 't trust me , but she didn 't turn me away . How are you feeling ? Mmph . I 've been better . Didn 't have to exaggerate much . Hang in there . You have to find the serum ... All of it ... and destroy it . It 's too dangerous . I understand . I have to go now . I 'll call when I can . If you help him , he 'll only betray you again . What do you suggest I do ? He is my brother , and he 's in pain . Kill him . That 'll stop the pain . I 'll even do it for you . Watch him . If he gets any worse , you let me know . And if he tries anything , then kill him . So , we 're moving the moon rocks to Gallery 3 to make room for the space shuttle . Okay . It 's good to see you . It 's been forever . It 's been two weeks . A phone call would 've been nice ... a text ... anything . You practically disappeared . I 'm sorry , Leon . I must 've gotten carried away . Into the glamorous world of Vanessa Anders , or with your actor boyfriend ? A little of both . I knew it was that guy . It 's always a guy . Well , that 's over now . Things got a little too intense , but let 's not talk about that . I 've been a really bad friend , and I 'm really sorry . Will you forgive me ? We 've all been there . I 'm just glad you 're back . Me too . I forgot how exciting moon rocks can be . Right ? I 'll be right back . Okay , Carl , what are you doing here ? I was instructed to keep an eye on you . How are you feeling ? Like my skin is on fire . This injection should help stabilize you . What is it ? The serum ... just a small dose . Just enough to help you with withdrawal symptoms . Mmph . Has that Richard Knox fellow arrived ? Richard Knox ? Richard Knox , the venture capitalist ? What are you doing with him ? Don 't worry about it . Didn 't she tell you ? Your sister has big plans for my magic DNA . She 's going to sell me to the highest bidder . Is that true ? You 're selling the serum ? We don 't have Vanessa Anders ' money . Don 't we deserve to salvage something from all this ? Yes , Griffin , if I 'm going to be stuck in this time , I 'm going to do it as a rich man . What do you care about money ? Enough . You need to rest . You should feel better in a few hours . I 'll tell you all about it then . May I help you ? What are you doing here ? I know that you called Vanessa about Carl . Don 't blame her . It was my idea . I needed to know that you were safe . John is still out there . I can handle myself just fine . Selfishly , it was for my own peace of mind . And you had to come here and tell me this in person ? Another selfish move on my behalf . How are you ? Jane , I hate how we left things . It 's time for my break . Why don 't we go outside ? As you can see , the patient has become septic . He has a high fever , some swelling , and even some mental deterioration . He volunteered for this ? He let himself contract a fatal disease ? Who does this ? A brave individual helping push the boundaries of science , Mr. Knox . And wellpaid , I trust . And just like that , I 've eradicated a disease once considered deadly . For the fourth time , I might add . Remarkable . How are you manipulating the DNA ? It 's an offshoot of my father 's work combined with my own research . This is my father 's journal . He left me his findings . Your father 's work with the DoD back in the ' 80s . It was shut down before it was realized . Now Brooke and I have been continuing it . No side effects of note ? Perhaps two worth mentioning . Number one , the serum enhances the subject 's strength approximately 600 % . And two , it 's highly addictive . You 've created a Superman . We prefer to call them " super soldiers . " You think there 's a military application for the drug ? During wartime , you 're gonna want these guys on the front lines . Each has the strength of six men , significantly reducing the number of soldiers needed on the ground . They 're resistant to disease and chemical weapons , and ... they 're easy to control . All we need is the funding to perfect it . Who else knows about this ? Just you , as of right now . And you didn 't want to take this to the Department of Defense ? I 've learned from my father 's mistakes . I take it your test trials wouldn 't survive an ethics board . Richard , that 's why we called on you . I know that discretion is where you thrive . I want to move on this right away , before word gets out . I can set up a meeting tonight of investors . Are you prepared for that ? Sure . Just tell us where and when . And you name again ? Stevenson ... Dr.Stevenson. Well , doctors , let me make a few phone calls . I know I shouldn 't have come , but I just ... wanted to know how you 're doing . I 'm good . I 've really missed you . I missed you , too , but ... what more can we do ? I mean , think about it . What 's gonna happen to us ? No matter how you write this story , it always ends with you returning to 1893 , where you belong . You have to write your books . You have to live your life , and I should just get on with mine . It 's the only ending for us . It 's for the best . I suppose so . I should get back to work . Goodbye , H.G. Ooh . I am so sorry . God . Thank you . I should 've been looking . I 'm so ... Get him in . No ! They took him ! Hurry ! Who are you ? What is the meaning of this ? I 'm sure you 're really confused right now , but I 'm gonna ask the questions , if you don 't mind . Well , I do mind , actually . Where am I ? Someplace private , so we can talk without interruptions . Let 's start with your name . I have nothing to tell you . Well , my name is Agent Danielle Forbes , and I work for the United States Department of Defense . Now , let 's start with , how 'd you get to New York City , how long have you been here , and what are you doing here ? None of which is your business . Wrong . My job is to protect this country from dangerous people . Why do you believe that I 'm dangerous ? Guys , thanks for helping out with this , but I think I need to question him alone . I 'll meet you back at the field office . They 're from the New York division . They 're not aware of why I 'm really here . Which is ... ? I 'm from D.C. , and while I do work for the D.O.D. , I 'm an astrophysicist . While I wish I knew what that was ... How disappointing . I was hoping I wouldn 't have to explain that to H.G. Wells . Well , that was easy . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Don 't insult me , Mr. Wells . I 've put a lot on the line coming here . Let 's stop playing games . What do you say ? Try to sit up . Yeah . I feel a little better . Thank you . It 's only temporary . The serum has proved extremely addictive . I 'll try to wean you off of it slowly . Let 's go ! Be back in a few hours . So , how much money do you think this serum will fetch ? Enough for all of us . Knox is known for his overseas tales . You don 't care if the serum goes to Russia or North Korea ? They have deeper pockets . True . This could be huge . John , congratulations , you really are adapting well to modern times . We need to get going . Please see my brother back to his room . You mean my cell ? You don 't have to lock me up , Brooke . Yes , she does . So , you refuse to admit it . Why would I admit to something so preposterous ? As an astrophysicist with the DoD , it is my job to track unexplained anomalies . Recently , my department picked up on a large energy source in New York . It had a geographical signature we 've never seen before with a structure that seemed to pierce both space and time . It sort of reminded me of a black hole . Does any of this sound familiar ? It sounds ridiculous . Perhaps you should recalibrate your instruments . That 's what my colleagues said . Well , perhaps you should listen to them . I did , and I got the same results . So I developed software that mapped the fluctuations . Multiple signatures across Manhattan , another on an island on the coast of Maine , and one more in London . I started to figure out the pattern ... The strength of the energy signature tells me how long ago it was formed . Based on the active rate of energy decay , I dated them . Manhattan is 2017 , Maine is 1980 , and London is 1893 . Do you know who lived in London in 1893 ? Many people . Including H.G. Wells , but I 'm sure that 's just a coincidence . I believe that these anomalies pose a danger to space and time . I need to understand what 's going on . They 're all gone.Okay. I 've deactivated her security system . Great . Watch the door . Let us know if anyone shows up . Griffin , this is Cameron . He 's a cyber specialist . How you doing ? He 's on my payroll . Where 's H.G. ? He ran into some trouble . Carl 's on his way to get him right now . Okay . The lab is downstairs . We should hurry . The only thing that 's gonna get you out of this is the truth . I demand that you untie me . I have to be somewhere . Where ? What 's going on ? Tell me and I might let you go . There 's no time . This would 've been a lot easier if you had just trusted me . Draw your gun slowly ... and put it on the ground . Jane ? Jane , you shouldn 't be here . I 'm a Federal Agent . You 're making a big mistake . Since when do Federal Agents kidnap citizens ? This is official government business . Really ? Because this all looks really shady to me . Untie him . Let 's get out of here . How long is this gonna take you ? Depends on how sophisticated her security is . I 'll know in a bit . Is that the serum ? Yes . Are you okay ? I will be . Let 's just get rid of it . Are there any other computer terminals in the house ? Brooke 's research is on her laptop . You 'll need to wipe that , too . I don 't see it . She must 've taken it with her . Damn it . We need that laptop . How did you know I was here ? Carl and I followed you . Who was that woman ? She was a DoD agent . She knows who I am . The government knows ? It 's Vanessa . Vanessa ? Brooke is on her way to a meeting with a venture capitalist named Richard Knox . He 's the investor we 've been looking for . All right , what do I do now ? Brooke took her laptop with her to the meeting with Knox . We 're destroying everything at the lab , but we need her laptop because it contains all her research . Where is this meeting taking place ? I 'll text you the address . Now , I have a way we can remotely destroy everything on her computer . And how do I do that ? I 'll put Cameron on now . I 've created an app that can remotely delete Brooke 's laptop , but I need you to download it to your phone . I 'll send it to your phone , Jane . What do we do after it 's downloaded ? If you can get close enough to Brooke 's laptop , I can do the rest on my end . I 'm texting you the address now . Be careful . Why does John care about Project Utopia ? He was against it . Or he needed to control it . John has always been about power and prestige . He wasn 't just a doctor in 1893 . He was the chief surgeon . You don 't have to do this . I know . It 's not far . Let 's go . Okay . William , I want you to stay in the lobby and make sure we don 't have any interruptions . Yes , Ma 'am . Dr. Monroe . Mr. Knox . Dr. Stevenson . I have assembled some very excited investors . And we are very excited to meet them . And I hope you 're ready . There 's only one shot with these people . We 're more than ready . Your confidence is inspiring . Follow me . How do we know this is everything ? I know my sister . She keeps everything contained in one place . I have to find my father 's journal . I saw it earlier . It has to be down here somewhere . What ? Thank you . I 've ruined my life , Vanessa . It 's over for me , but it doesn 't have to be over for you . It 's not over for you , Griffin . Everything I wanted ... My career , a life with you ... there 's no coming back from this . How do we get inside ? There must be another entrance . Carl , if you go that way , I 'll go around back . I 'm coming with you . This way . The staircase . Knox 's office is on the fourth floor . Don 't move . Stop ! - Jane , you all right ? - Yeah . Did you follow us ? Yes . Now , care to explain what 's going on ? It took five shots to stop that man . Somebody better start explaining this real quick . You were right about me . I am H.G. Wells , and I traveled here from 1893 . And my time machine and I have made an absolute mess of things , and we 're trying to fix it . 1980 ... the island in Maine ... Do you know what happened on that island ? Yes , I do . It was a DoD research program ... Genetic engineering . Yes , but it went horribly wrong . And a deadly drug was brought back to this time , and we have to stop it . How do we do that ? By stopping the people who have it . They 're on the fourth floor of this building . Well , then , let 's do it . Ladies and gentlemen , we live in uncertain times ... ISIS , global terrorism , even our own country is divided against itself . The world has become a powder keg , and some days it seems like the match could come from anywhere at nay second . It 's no longer a question of if there 's going to be another world war , but when , and how bad it will be . It 's in our nature to tear each other apart . So now , more than ever , safety is important , strength is important . We have better guns , bigger bombs , chemical weapons , but they 're not making us any safer . In fact , they 're making our soldiers more vulnerable than ever . Warfare has evolved . Our world has evolved ... but ... human beings have not ... Until now . Humanity is about to take its next step forward . This is Project Utopia . Human enhancement ... It 's no longer just a theory . See for yourselves . Increased strength ... The strength of six men . Enhanced endurance and stamina . Immunity to most known bacteria and viral infections . Rapid healing . This way . Tonight I am offering you the opportunity ... And now it just needs to log on to Brooke 's computer . The strength of six men ? Please . I 've been involved with enhancement therapy for years . This defies all current findings . You 're correct . It does . What I 'm saying , Dr. Monroe , is , this sounds a lot like your father talking . And we know how his work went nowhere . Perhaps a demonstration is in order . Adam , a simple handshake for Mr. Stillman . Go ahead , shake his hand . Stop ! Stop ! Okay . You 're breaking it . Adam , relax . Let him go . Aah . I think the point has been made . This is not a trick . Project Utopia is real . Now , the serum does have its side effects . But with the right program of maintenance doses , we can use those effects to make the subjects subservient . Take Adam , for instance . Would anyone care to see what else he can do ? Any requests ? Is it working ? I installed the virus on her laptop , but it 's still too far away to initiate the wipe . Well , how close does it need to be ? I don 't know . Jane . Imagine soldiers who can withstand firearms and biochemical weapons , who don 't need to rest or recover , who don 't experience concussion or death . Now , the serum ... will experience fear or doubt . This is all part of the package that I can offer you . Now , shall we talk about your investment ? Brooke . Is there something wrong ? I 'm not sure . What the devil is going on ? No . No , they 're wiping it . What the hell is this ? It must be Wells . He must be in the building . What are you talking about ? You have a security breach . They 're trying to steal my research right now . We got to go . No . They 're in the ... They 're in the lab , as well . They 'll destroy everything . Look , I 'll have to get back to you when I figure out what 's going on . We have to get to the lab . Where are you going , John ? John ? Come on , hurry . Where 's Jane ? I don 't know . Hurry up ! Hey , over there ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Where 's your friend ? I don 't know . God . You all right ? I 'm fine . Go find her . Are you sure ? I 'll be back . What are you doing here ? You seem frightened . You 've cornered me . What do you expect ? Well , an explanation would be nice . After everything he did to you , after he lied to you ... how can you still trust him ? Don 't do this . Where is he ? This is not about H.G. or me . This is about the serum . You need to stop . I know you 're mad at me . " Mad " ? No , I 'm ... I 'm not mad . I 'm gonna tear you apart . Are you okay ? I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Are you all right ? Did he hurt you ? I 'm fine . He didn 't get to me . We have to warn Vanessa . Right . Were you able to wipe Brooke 's laptop ? Yes , but you have to get out of the townhouse . Brooke is on her way over . We 're leaving now . Are we good here ? All finished . Good . Let 's go . We have to leave . They 're on their way back . I can 't find the journal . Where else could it be ? I 'll keep looking . You go . Get out of here . I 'll be right behind you . No . I 'll help . You should go . Griffin . Go . Go . Get out of here . God , she 's really bleeding . Take her somewhere safe . I 'm going after Brooke . I 'll make sure she gets help . Brooke . I should 've just let you die the first time . Where 's the journal ? I don 't know . Liar . It 's the only thing you have left . It 's the only reason you came back . What are you gonna do , burn the place down ? Fitting , isn 't it ? Wait . Okay , you win . Goodbye , Griffin . Get out of my way . No . Utopia doesn 't exist , Wells . It never did , and it never will . Wells , get the journal ! No ! Don 't ! No ! No , no , no , no ! No ! No . No . No , no , no . Wells , go ! Now ! I 'm so sorry , Vanessa . Griffin died to destroy the serum . Yes . Project Utopia is no more . And Brooke and John ? They 're still out there . But we will find them . I want this to be over . It 's time for this to be over . Yes . The threealarm fire ripped through this townhouse behind me earlier tonight , spreading rapidly and threatening nearby residences . So far , we can confirm that Griffin Monroe died in the fire . Mr. Monroe was running for the 28th District 's Senate spot and was widely considered a shooing , but saw a steady drop in polls in recent months . His campaign office de ... Let me help you with that . You know this isn 't over . We can recreate the serum . You can 't be serious ? All we need is your blood and your DNA . Everything else can be replicated . Don 't sell me a dog . John , this is ... This is just a setback . No , no , no , no , no . This is over . I 'm not a rich woman . I don 't care . There are plenty of other ways to make money . And I 'm not playing your little games anymore . Your way failed , so now we do things my way ... And we start by destroying Wells . Do you understand ? Yes . Yes , of course . Then we 're clear . Project Utopia is over . Yeah . It 's over . Good . It 's unbelievable . I 'm putting my trust in you , showing you this , telling you the truth . Who would I tell ? Who would believe me ? The DoD cut my budget because they thought my theories were a waste of time . You 're not tempted to run back , try and prove your theories ? The DoD would not know what to do with this information . How 's your wound ? I 'll live . So , aren 't you worried ? About what ? You destroyed Project Utopia and restored the time line , but what about next time ? As long as the time machine exists , don 't you risk doing this again , or worse ? Yes . There 's a matter of unfinished business . I have to stop John . I 'll help you stop him . Forgive my suspicions , but ... why would you help me ? There are some of us out there who believe in your Utopia . Good does exist in this world . One doubts . One shouldn 't . So predictable . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . Save your breath . Please . You tried to sedate me and take my blood without my permission . I thought you were smarter than that . What will you do ? Don 't you worry about that . Just go to sleep . When I wake ... Darling , you won 't be waking up . Vanessa 's upstairs . Yes . Thank you for helping me today . I know how difficult it was for you . Jane , I never meant for you to be surrounded by so much danger . I know . And I know I said I didn 't want to be a part of all of this , but ... I can 't help but think that maybe I was wrong for walking away . Maybe I 'm supposed to be here . Surrounded by death and destruction ? To help you stop all this death and destruction . It 's a question of destiny . There 's only one real way we 'll know my purpose in all of this ... and that 's to stay . And when it 's all over ? You 'll leave , and it 'll break my heart ... but I 'll pick up the pieces and move on ... and so will you . Whether we want to or not ? Yes , whether we want to or not . Hello ? Good evening . John ? If it isn 't Romeo himself , back together again with his Juliet ... how romantic . Is Brooke with you ? In a sense . I don 't think you have to worry about Project Utopia anymore . You killed her ? And you 're next , H.G. One last chat , you and me , old friend . I 'm coming for you , and soon , this will all be over .

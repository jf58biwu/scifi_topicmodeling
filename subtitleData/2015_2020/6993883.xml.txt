 * Bleeds [ chattering , shouting ] * But it bleeds although you block it * * But it bleeds . Oh , get it together , Becca ! You gotta help me , please ! I 'm sorry . I 'll do anything you want ! Just tell him to stop ! - I want it to be over . - Let go of me ! [ rumbling ] Please , please ! Help me ! I don 't know what you 're talking about . Come on ! [ rumbling ] - It 's getting worse ! - What 's going on ? Hey , are we having an earthquake ? What are you talking about , dude ? - You don 't feel that ? - Feel what ? - Becca ! What 's going on ? - I don 't know . No ! No ! No ! Look ! Save Hennessey Hall ! Save Hennessey Hall ! [ chanting continues ] [ grunts ] What are you doing ? Get out of the way ! It 's coming back down ! What are you doing ? It 's coming back down ! Are you insane ? You almost just got killed . Bummer . - Pizza ? - Okay . What is wrong with you people ? Hey , don 't sweat it . There 's plenty of things to do around here . [ birds chirping ] * I don 't know what 's in my head * * What I feel , what I see * Hey , Max ! I just got in the new shirts . What ? What do you mean , somebody cut you out ? That 's impossible . * Oh , singularity * It 's happening to me . Hey , hey ! Where did you get that shirt ? Where did you get it ? Hey , excuse me . Listen , where did you get that ? Hi , hi . Excuse me . Where did you buy that shirt ? It 's pretty awesome , huh ? Yeah , but where did you get it ? Some guy was selling them at the student union . You 've seen ' em , you want ' em , I got ' em . $ 20 bucks a pop . Let 's get the money out . Here you go ... Hey ! - Where did you get these ? - Back off , man . - Yo ! - I 'm taking what 's mine . - I 'm calling Security ! - Yeah ? You do that . Then maybe you can explain to them why you 're selling stolen property ! Whoa . I don 't know anything about that ! Who gave theses to you ? Who ? Some guy who said that , if I helped sell the shirts , he 'd cut me in . Good . You can tell me how I can contact him . Give me these . Yeah , Arun , listen . Somebody 's stealing from us . I need you to call the guy and set up a meeting . I don 't know , Ari . What if he finds out who I am ? Arun , it 's your artwork . He 's ripping you off , too ! - Arun ! - Okay , okay . Listen , his name is Elliott Carpenter . Call me when you set it up and I 'll meet you there . It doesn 't even look good on you ! [ pounding on door ] How does it feel ? [ phone rings ] Damn ! Hey , Ari . Arun , everything set ? Yeah , he should be here in 30 minutes . What if he finds us out and we lose ' em ? Just get him to take you to the merchandise . You call me and I 'll be there . You know , this affects you too , Arun . [ knocking on door ] Oh , crap . He 's early . David , aren 't you gonna let me in ? Of course . Come in . So you 're looking to buy . - Yeah . - For yourself or resale ? Resale . - So can I see the stuff ? - What stuff ? The shirts . Yeah , I have to be careful , David . You never know who 's a plant . Yeah . I 'm sorry . I 'm just a little nervous . I 've never done this before . [ pounding ] What 's that ? Nothing . It 's just an unauthorized pet . You have to hide it . You never know who 's a plant , right ? Let 's get going . [ pounding ] Hey , I heard there 's another protest later tonight . - Is this the campus green ? - Yeah . It seems so different . Things are always changing around here . Get used to it . Do you go to school here ? Yeah . I figured out a way to cheat . 1616 Farragut . Don 't move until I get there ! I might need your help . I think you 're really gonna love these . What ? Oh , the shirts . - Yeah , yeah , awesome . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , sure , yeah , totally . - You seem a little anxious . No , no , no . I 'm good . You know what relaxes me when I 'm anxious , David ? Hanging upside down . What is that ? You 're really gonna like it . I mean , it really calms the soul . No that we have one . Try it out . Actually , I have to get going . I insist . It 's a real rush . Yeah , I don 't really like this . Yeah , well , you 're gonna have plenty of time to get used to it . - Ari ! Help ! - I 'm gonna kill you ! Come on ! We can work something out ! How about 50-50 ? 50-50 ? It 's my stuff ! How about 60-40 ? I mean , you gotta work with me here , you know ? Ari ? Come back ! Ari ! Who the hell do you think you are ? Just a guy playing along like everyone else . - Not by the rules ! - Rules . You know , that 's the problem with this place ! There 's too many rules ! But you 're not supposed to do this ! [ grunts ] Tough spot ! Help me up ! I only help my partners . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! I need help ! Somebody help me ! Oh , no . He 's not breathing ! Someone call 9-1-1 ! What is wrong with you ! He needs help ! Call 9-1-1 ! Why won 't anybody help me ? Don 't move . Why not ? Why not ? You just fell like 13 stories . But I 'm okay . How can you be okay ? I feel okay . You 're not bleeding . Everything looks so strange . What do you mean ? I mean , I know this place . I 've been here before . But it just ... it looks different , you know ? Yeah , actually I do . You need to go to the hospital . No , no , I don 't think that 's necessary . I don 't care what you think . You 're coming with me . Well , everything checks out all right . But I saw him fall 13 stories . But everything checks out all right . Everything checks out all right . But that 's impossible . I saw him fall from the top of a building . Have a nice day . Have a nice day . But , I ... Have a good day . It 's empty . Well , that 's weird . That 's weird ? Hey , what 's your name ? Becca . Well , thank you , Becca . Yeah , no problem . Listen , if you 're free , maybe we could grab dinner some ... ow ! What ? Are you insane ? - Does it hurt ? - Yeah , it hurts ! You just stabbed me in the hand ! How do you explain that then ? Maybe we can see another doctor . No . I don 't need another doctor . What I need is to find the guy who 's stealing my business away . No , you can 't just leave . We have to figure this out . Stay away from me . Look , I 'm in Weinstein 350 if you change your mind . [ grunting ] Hello ? Is anyone there ? [ pounding ] Dude , shut ... Interesting skeletons you keep in there . Give it back . Come get it . What do you want from me ? Well , you put me in a tough spot . So to make it up to me , I want you to join a worthy cause that 'll help me get out of it . No . I won 't do it . Yes , you will . - I 'll just ... - What ? Erase them ? Not while they 're locked in , dummy . 1060 Norman Avenue . You have until four . Can I help you ? Is this Room 318 , Weinstein 318 ? Oh , Weinstein 's across the green . - This is Mendon Hall . - I 'm such an idiot . I 'm sorry for bothering you . That 's okay . What 's that ? A painting . You paint ? I didn 't know that . Why would you ? Right , of course . I 'm not making any sense today . Look , I 'm late for my opening , but if you want , I 'll be passing Weinstein . I can show you where it is . That 'd be really nice , Arun . How do you know my name ? I read it . Yeah . You look like you just been through a carwash without the car . Yeah , I 've had better days . Damn it ! This looks terrible ! Izzy , something really weird is happening here . I can 't do this . Whoa , what 's wrong , Iz ? I ... I just wish I 'd brought that other dress ! I just saw a man fall from the top of a building and not get hurt . What do you think about this one ? Who cares about your dress ? Did you even hear what I just said ? I care ! I have to make sure everything is perfect tonight or this is gonna be the shortest date in history ! He fell 13 stories and just got up and walked away . What is wrong with everybody ? [ sighs ] - Uh , when did you start ? - I just signed up today . Any recommendations on what I should do first ? Uh , whatever you like , really . I sculpt . - You do ? - Since I was 12 . But I don 't think I 'm good enough to get into a show like you . You just need to get people to like you . Well , then I guess you must have a lot of talent . Uh , I don 't really know . It 's just sort of in comparison to everyone else here . So what do your parents think ... about your sculpting , I mean ? They don 't know anything about it . They think I 'm going to class . Whoa . There 's just something inside you can 't let anyone stop , you know . Yeah . Hey , why don 't you come to my art opening tonight ? Sure , I 'd love to come . Hi , there . Love to come where ? - Who is this ? - Um ... - I 'm Greta . - Izzy , Greta . And who 's Greta ? I was just helping her find ... - My room . - Oh , your room , really ? - He was just being a gentleman . - Well , he is that . That 's why he invited me to his art opening . Oh , is this before or after he helps you find your room ? Look , I 'll see you at the exhibit , okay ? It was nice meeting you , Izzy . I got to drop this off . Do you wanna come with me ? Of course . You know , I looked for you last night . It didn 't come in . I had to do something . Yeah , real life interferes sometimes . You know , that girl , it was just nothing . I 'm not upset . I just got a little jealous . Jealous ? Why would you get jealous ? It 's just I 've imagined strolling out in the open like this for a long time . I don 't wanna lose that . Were your past boyfriends vampires or something ? Let 's just say they wouldn 't be seen in the light of day with me . What ? Do you have some sort of deformity I don 't know about ? Sometimes people are just afraid to let you be who you are . Yeah , like parents . What ? What 's wrong ? I just wish ... Wish what ? - Nothing . - Support the cause ! No limitations ! No restrictions ! No administrators ! That 's right ! Sign the petition ! Don 't be a hater . Don 't be ... Jerk-off ! We paid for this place ! We should be able to do what we want , right ? Isn 't that right ? Isn 't that right ? - Come on , Arun . - Isn 't that right ? Get away from us ! He doesn 't like to be kept waiting . - What was that about ? - I have to pop out . I forgot I had to do something . I 'll see you later at your opening , okay ? Okay , no problem . Okay . Hi . Do you have any books on people who survive major trauma ? Like big falls or something ? Niagara Falls , aisle 2 . No , like people who fall from buildings . Buildings , aisle 16 . [ sighs ] Am I losing it ? Well , whatever you lost , maybe I can help you find ? Better yet , maybe we could find something new ! Oh ! Get away from me ! Come on , let 's have some fun ! Isn 't that why we 're all here ? [ grunts ] Excuse me . You gotta help me . This guy is chasing me and ... excuse me ? Tight squeeze . Oh , loosen up . That kind of behavior isn 't allowed here . Next time , you 'll be kicked out . Guys , we were just playing around . What , you 're just gonna let him go ? David ? Come on in . - This the guy ? - This is him . Great . Elliott tells me you 're here to join . Dude , I 'm not your guy . - Look , David ... - Arun ? Jennifer ? No , I knew you didn 't really look like a David . Well , look at that . Isn 't that ironic ? What is he doing here ? You didn 't say anything to him ? Say something to me ? Now why would I do that ? But it is good to have a face just in case you don 't come through for me . And I will tell him . - You guys totally lost me . - She 's one of us , Arun . What do you want with me ? To sign a piece of paper saying you 'll join our cause . Why ? We only three more signatures and this place is ours . I like it how it is . Just sign it and you 'll never hear from us again . Okay , fine , I 'll join . You won 't be sorry . What did you tell him ? Nothing yet . - Unless I join you . - Precisely . Why me ? Why now ? The situation has changed . We 're almost there but the pickings are getting increasingly thin . In short , we need you . Get her away from me . Trust me , Iz . This is for the best . You know , I knew you were selfish . But I didn 't think you could be cruel . Right now , I 'm about to get kicked out of here . Good . I blew all my allowance money on this stupid place . But it 's gonna rock once these guys take over . Go away . I hate you . Jennifer sees the big picture . She gets it . It 's time for you to get with it , too . If you think you can scare me into joining , you 're wrong . You know , you could have made yourself look better . So you 'll be the one to tell him then ? Maybe I 'll take my chances . Good luck . We 're not the bad guys . So when you take over , how can I trust that you 're gonna keep quiet ? See , that 's the beauty of when we take over . Everyone 's business will be their own . I don 't believe you . Well , you 'll just have to trust me . Or tell him yourself . Maybe I 'll do that ! You are really pissing me off . You have until midnight to sign on or I 'm telling him . Give me the day to think about it . - You have until midnight ! - What ? They are all over us ! There isn 't much time ! Midnight . One more . It had to be done . You really mean that ? About everyone 's business being their own ? Freaks like Izzy won 't be around to find out . * This ain 't no time to celebrate * * For being a part of the scene * * It 's time to tweak and not fixate * Another ! You already exceeded your limit . Can I interest you in a cup of coffee ? I wanna drink till I 'm lying face down in my own vomit . You 've already exceeded your limit . Enough . How about a cup of coffee ? You moron ! What I need is another ... Never mind . Coffee ? Hey , cool if I buy you a drink ? Really ? Are you gonna do this ? - We 're just having fun . - Yeah , I know it 's fun now . What if it gets serious ? You guys don 't even know each other . What 's your problem ? I 'm just trying to save you from some heartache . Be miserable in your own life . Don 't bring it here . Arun , what am I doing to you ? * This darkened heart and darkened mind * * Are in a part of me that 's proving hard to find * I think I like that one best . Really ? You think it 's good ? Mm-hmm . I totally feel that way sometimes . So your parents want you to be a doctor , huh ? You don 't even know the half of it . They have me set up to marry some girl that I don 't even know . An arranged marriage ? It 's so unfair . I mean , I 've never even met this girl . How can you love someone you 've never met ? You can 't . I just imagine her to be this cow with like three heads and all these boils . Well , I can assure you she 's definitely not . I mean , you know , you can 't think that way . You be positive . My parents actually have me arranged , too . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . Look , I have a confession . Yeah ? I saw you today at the Griefers . I followed you . Look , you were acting really strange . And I was worried . I thought I would just check . And make sure everything 's okay . I mean , that 's probably why Izzy was there , too . Izzy ? That 's why she left so abruptly . She wasn 't following me . She was on her way there . Where is she anyway ? I need to call her . No , no . You need to calm down first , okay ? Just think it through . I 'm sure there 's a really good explanation for it . Maybe . Being here sometimes feels like an arranged marriage , right ? You don 't really always know who the other person is . Arun , Arun , I need to talk to you . All right , just give me a little ... I really need to talk to you . - I 'm busy ... - Now ! It 's okay . I 'll see you later , okay ? [ phone rings ] - Hello ? - Arun ? Yes ? This is me , Arun . I need to see you tonight . It 's really important . Okay . How about Campus Tap Room ? - 5 p.m. ? - Campus Tap Room . Look , I cannot find Elliott anywhere . - Have you seen him ? - No , I haven 't . Are you okay ? I 've had better days . Wonder what this place is gonna be like after they take over ? Man , this guy 's sick ! Too bad he 's a dot-head or we 'd keep him around . What did you just say ? What do you care ? - Come on , Ari , let 's just ... - No , no . I care because he 's my friend . Oh , isn 't that cute ? He standing up for his boyfriend . Ari , it 's not worth it ! Look , I 've had a very , very rough day and I suggest that you don 't add to it . - We don 't care . - Not even a little . [ grunting ] Get him ! [ coughs ] Woo ! Woo ! - Yeah , baby ! - Let 's go . Woo ! Ready for some coffee ? What I need is another shot ! You can have mine . Shot , please ? You got it , gorgeous . So what are we drinking to ? Confusion . Here or at home ? Both . Only , I never thought here would be so complicated . I get that . You 'd think that being here would be a lot easier than home life where not everyone 's so welcoming , you know . What are you up to ? Just buying a new friend a drink . Hey ! Hey ! What did I say ? You 're done . You 're cut off ! There 's no more ! Finished ! Finite ! Nada ! The only thing you 're gonna get is coffee , or you leave . - What do you want ? - Fine . Coffee . Coffee . Please , handsome bartender , can I have some coffee ? See ? Was that hard ? No , that 's not hard . You want another shot ? - Mm-hmm . - Hoo-hoo-hoo . So what 's your story ? Nothing exciting really . I just joined . Any particular reason ? Guys ? Well , there are a lot of great guys here . Other great guys . Please , he 's crazy about you . Anyone can see that . Anyway , it 's actually a guy . We knew each other as little kids and I heard he was here so I kind of hope to see how the adult version turned out . Have you found him yet ? So what about you ? I have to ask , what 's the deal with you and the Griefers ? What ? I saw you when you stopped by today . Oh , you 're one of them , too ? No , no , no . I was hiding from them . They found out something about me that I haven 't told Arun yet and they 're holding it over my head until I join them . Uh-oh . I totally didn 't mean for this to happen . I came here looking for a place where I can just be myself without all the judgment , you know ? And then I met Arun . He 's so sweet . I ... I just don 't want to blow it . What could be so bad , though , that you can 't tell him ? This happened once before . I can 't talk about it . Look , I know where you 're coming from . In my house , feelings are secondary . You 're told what to do and who to be with from almost the minute that you 're born . I would give anything to share a secret with someone that I love . Where do you think it 's gonna go , huh ? - Outside ? - I don 't know . Like I said , I never intended for this to happen . Arun is such an incredible person . He 's so soft , so open . And so malleable . You know ... sensitive . Guys where I 'm from like telling women what to do . That 's not really my type . I made plans to see him tonight and tell him . But I don 't know , I 'm having second thoughts . If he loves you , he 'll accept it . And if not , who needs him ? I thought you were just a manipulative bitch . Ouch ! [ laughs ] So why were you at the Griefers ? I was following Arun . Why was he at the Griefers ? They couldn 't have told him . They need me . Maybe you 're not the only one with a secret . * You 're missing all the clues * * You 're missing all the reasons * * You 're missing all the things right in front of you * * The pieces that tell the truth * * Then what 's the use ? What are you needing ? * What am I ? Hey , gorgeous . You could use an upgrade . How did you get in here ? You should keep it locked to non-friends . Oh ! Help ! Why are you doing this to me ? No more talking ! Do you really need another reason for me to kick your ass ? Is that all you 're gonna do ? [ grunts ] - You okay ? - Yeah . [ screams ] Ari ! Ari , I can 't hold on ! Ari ! You 're pulling me ! You 're pulling us both down ! - Jump ! - What ? - Jump ! - What do you mean , jump ? You 've already survived one fall ! That 's true . You want to test if I can do it again ? - We 're both gonna fall ! - Bye , guys . Wait , wait , wait ! Pull me up ! I 'll give you what you want ! Anything ! - I 'll give you what you want ! - Really ? Yes , please ! Just help me up ! You know what ? I think I 'm just gonna let him pull you down ! - Let us up ! - No ! Get off me ! - Climb on me ! - Get off me ! Never ! Hurry ! Grab the rail ! Grab the rail ! Ari ! Let 's see what happens when you go through the window ! Go ahead . That works just as well . [ knocking on door ] - Security ! - Coming ! Stop ! Tell them to go away , and I 'll stop . I want every penny back ! He attacked me and all you care about is money ? Look , if she tells , you can kiss your money goodbye ! He 's not gonna bother you again . How do you know that ? 'Cause they 'll be too scared to . Yeah , well , she 's not really my type anyway . Well , that wasn 't the most elegant rescue . But thanks for getting rid of him . Yeah , well , you 're welcome . Why are you here ? Listen , there 's something else . I got into this fight and I had a big piece of glass sticking out of the side of my head . And when I pulled it out , there wasn 't any blood . Not even a cut . And you wouldn 't let go to save me from falling ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Am I just supposed to assume that I 'm indestructible ? What are you thinking ? I think that you and Elliott have something in common . Me and Elliott ? What could we possibly have in common ? No blood . I don 't understand . Before I fell out the window , I stabbed Elliott with it . What are you ? What are you hiding ? Hiding ? I 'm not hiding anything ! Listen , listen . I just want what 's mine . That 's it . You 're something else . Becca , I swear I know just as much as you do . How do you know him ? I found out that he was ripping me off . I didn 't even meet him until today . This can 't be a coincidence . Where are you from ? I don 't know . What do you mean , you don 't know ? I mean , I can 't remember . I can 't remember where I 'm from . I can 't remember anything before being at this school . It 's okay . Maybe the fall did something to your memory . Let 's go see if we can find anything at student records . Excuse me ? My friend would like to get a look at his records . He would like to see his records , please ? You see that ? It 's like I 'm not even there . Hello ? It 's not just you and Elliott . There 's something wrong with this whole place . Check the computer . Frozen . Yeah , this one too . Check the cabinets . Empty . - They 're all empty . - This doesn 't make any sense . I know . I think Elliott knows more than we do . I need to talk to him . No , Becca , that 's not a good idea . He has answers . I 'm sure of it . Hey , Ari blocked me from accessing his stuff . - Good . - It 's your fault . It 's my fault ! You 're the one who 's trying to steal from him ! Yeah . Well , now you 're gonna help me . Look , those guys , those psychos you made me join destroyed months and months of my hard work . I 'm through helping you . Hey , is that your new friend over there ? She 's cute . Why don 't we go over together and we can give her a tour of your room . That 'd be fun . - What do you want from me ? - I want you go to Ari 's and steal a bunch of his new stuff . - No way . - Yes way . Look , Ari is my friend and we 're business partners . Partners steal from each other all the time . - It 's no big deal . - Yeah , if you 're a thief . Okay , if I get caught , I 'll get kicked out of here . Possibly . The alternative , of course , is you come clean and then you definitely get kicked out . So what do you say ? I can 't do this . I 'm sorry , Ari . What are you doing ? Arun , what are you doing here ? - I think you should leave . - Whose are these ? You need to go , okay ? We 'll get in trouble if you 're caught . Are you stealing these ? I don 't have a choice , okay ? [ police radio chatter ] Oh , my God . Come on ! You are in a rules violation ! Maybe they didn 't see us go through ! Move that ! Come on ! I don 't think it 's gonna hold . Damn it ! Look ! This isn 't just one wall . There 's two walls that meet right here ! They 're gonna bust through . - Push ! - Greta ! Push ! I didn 't know you could do that . Neither did I. We should go . - Yeah . - Yeah . So you wanna tell me what that was all about ? I can 't . Well , you don 't strike me as a rule breaker . So what 's the deal ? - I 'm a rebel . - Yeah . That 's why you were so eager to join the Griefers , right ? I was forced to join . He made me . Who ? Elliott . He wants me to steal from my friend , Ari . What could he possibly have on you that would make you do that ? Look , I just racked up two violations helping you . One more and I 'm out . You owe me an explanation ! Okay , fine . I 'll tell you . But you 're not gonna like it or me . My parents . Whoa . Look , I know it 's freaky , but ... That 's awesome . I had no idea how much you were like me . [ phone rings ] Stood up ? * You got that freaky karma * * You got that sticky charm-a * * There 's some electric static * * Fulfilling in your genes * * You 've got no imitation ... [ knocking on door ] I didn 't join your game ! If I find you , I 'm gonna report you ! Idiots ! Jennifer ? Hey ! Did you leave this on my bed ? I trusted you . I know , but we just need a couple more people and then we 'll own this place . Don 't you want the freedom to do what you want here ? Oh my God , you just sound like one of those jerks ! - Well , don 't you ? - No . I want everyone to stay out of my business ! - That 's what we want , too . - Telling Arun definitely does not qualify as staying out of my business . I can 't believe you told them . If you help out , they 're not even gonna tell anybody . - Jesus , Jennifer . - Come on , just help us . Come on ! * You put your crimes on deposit * * And your reasons on your back * * Your mind in the closet * And you leave it where it 's at * * You make some confessions . - Let 's split up . - Are you sure that 's safe ? We have to find him . Yeah , all right , here . Take this . - If you need me , just hit send . - All right . Yo ! I got t-shirts , sunglasses ! - Coolest stuff here ! - Let 's see it . - Cool . How much ? - $ 15 . A whole lot cheaper than the guy who was selling them yesterday . [ rumbling ] - Oh , my God ! - Izzy , I 'm so sorry ! Oh , it 's okay , Greta . I 'm gonna go change . If you see Arun , can you tell him to wait for me ? Yeah . Oh , hey , Greta . Have you seen Izzy ? No . I don 't think she 's here yet . - Why don 't we go get a drink ? - All right . You know , I didn 't like you when I first saw you . Awesome . I thought you were a typical American . You know , arrogant , egocentric . Then I saw what a softy you were . It 's endearing . * With all these broken plans * * What 's left for us to do but dance * * We 're stuck inside the circumstance * Hey , Arun , hi . Have you seen a guy ? Brown hair , blue shirt , crazy eyes ? Are you okay ? Here , have a drink . Thanks . So I 'm coming to Amer ... to where you live . See some relatives . Thought maybe you and I could ... - Hey ! - You screwed me again ! The Security came . What was I supposed to do ? God , you are so lame . - Hey , he 's telling the truth . - Look , stay out of it . Elliot , look , I 'm not your guy , all right ? Look , I need you to get rid of Ari . What do you mean , get rid of him ? What the hell do you think I mean ? He 's my friend ! Yeah , well , it 's either him or me . It 's not really a hard choice . You were saying ? Nothing . Yeah . That 's what I thought . [ rumbling ] You guys feel that ? So that 's Elliott ? Yeah . Woop ! Well ? He said I have till midnight . Yeah . That 's like an hour from now . Well , why don 't you be a Griefer somewhere else and talk to me in an hour then ? You know , you might want to think real hard on that attitude . Looks like you have competition . Don 't be ridiculous . Arun loves me . She looks like a real woman to me . - Oh , hi , Izzy . - Izzy ? - Arun ? - Sorry about the date . I actually totally forgot I made one . Really ? Where were you ? - Well , he was with me . - You ? - Mm-hmm . - It 's not what you think . She 's just helping me with something . Greta , how could you ? Oh , it 's not like that , Iz . It was important . That 's all I get . I had something important , too . What ? It doesn 't matter now . Hey ! You know how I feel about you . Do I ? Yeah . I hate how you do that . Come on . [ gasps ] If I didn 't know better , I 'd think you liked me . All I want from you is answers ! Well , there 's a bedroom we can use to unravel all my mysteries . First I want to know why you don 't bleed . Why are you talking about ? I jabbed you in the neck with a scalpel . You 're serious , aren 't you ? It doesn 't matter . What 's that ? [ grunts ] That 's me ! I made a decision . Yes ? I was thinking maybe that we could be together for real ? Are you serious ? There 's something I need to tell you . Something important . Crap ! I gotta go ! I 'm late ! But we 'll meet up later . This is real . I feel strange . Me too . Everything looks familiar . But it 's like I 'm ... seeing things for the first time . Like that . You 've seen this 100 times . I know , but now I don 't like it . But it 's my artwork . You love my artwork . Everyone loves my artwork . [ rumbling ] What is that ? Come on ! Wait a minute ! Where are you going ? To find out what that is ! I think we should just wait here until it finishes . We don 't want to get caught outside in a panic and get crushed . [ gasps ] See ? All I see is that you should be the one going first ! Oh , get it together , Becca ! You gotta help me ! Please ! Help me ! - Help ! - Look , look , I 'm sorry . I 'll do anything you want ! Just tell them to stop ! I don 't want it to be over . Let go of me ! Please , please , help me ! Help me ! I don 't know what you 're talking about . Come on ! - It 's getting worse ! - What 's going on ? Hey , are we having an earthquake ? What are you talking about , dude ? - You don 't feel that ? - Feel what ? Becca , what 's going on ? I don 't know . No , no , no ! Look ! Did that just happen ? What 's wrong with you ? That guy just exploded right in front of your eyes ! Okay . What do you mean , okay ? I 'm sure he deserved it . Am I going insane ? No , you 're not . There 's Arun and Izzy . Did you see that ? That guy , he just exploded ! Hey , did you see that guy explode ? Hey , you 're the dude who designed these , right ? - Yeah . - They 're awesome . Back to the guy who ate the grenade ! Sounds like he got axed . Please tell me you saw that . - You did too ? - Yeah . I thought we were losing it . Did you find anyone else that did ? We need to go to the Campus Police . No . We can 't go , okay ? They 'll think we 're crazy ! They 'll lock us up or something . Seriously , Arun ? No . Security must know something . When Elliott attacked me , they gave him one last warning . They have to know him . Maybe we just forget all this happened . Sure . Sprinkle fairy dust on it and wish it away . We can 't just hide from this . What are you doing ? What 's it your business ? Just thought you were looking for someone . So what if I am ? I 'm good at finding people . Are you now ? Give me a shot . I 'm looking for a girl named Izzy . - I thought you might be . - You know her ? Maybe . What do you want with her ? Her time is up . To join ? Doesn 't surprise me . Izzy is not the type to join a person like you . Yes . Well , I can be pretty persuasive . You 've got something on her . Something she doesn 't want her boyfriend to find out . How do you know that ? Tell me what it is and I 'll help you . I don 't need your help . You 're running out of time , aren 't you ? Maybe she 's waiting you out . Maybe she knows that Arun 's not gonna believe a guy like you . Now me me he 'll believe . But that would devastate him . Oh , all of a sudden , you have a conscience . Don 't worry . I 'll take care of it myself . There 's got to be another way to get her away from him . Do you guys feel different ? - Different ? - How ? I don 't know , different , like , awake or something ? In a room full of people , we 're the only ones who saw what happened to Elliott . You see that ? I broke that into pieces 15 minutes ago . How is that possible ? How is it possible that I can 't get hurt ? Show them . What did you do ? - Are you crazy ? - Just wait . He 's super human . I don 't think it 's just him . I think we 're all connected . And it 's time to find out if I 'm right . [ shouts ] Are you insane ? Are you a crazy , woman ? No . I 'm not crazy . There 's not a scratch . How is that possible ? What are we ? I don 't know . I don 't know what we are . I don 't know where we are either . What do you mean ? We 're at college . Well , Becca has a theory that maybe we 're not . And not only are we different , but maybe this whole place is . And what do you think ? I don 't know . What are you guys doing ? Greta ! Thank God , you 're okay . Why wouldn 't I be ? I 'm okay too , thanks . Your turn to help me up , huh ? Yeah , I think you 've done your share of falling . What are you guys doing ? You mean the stairs ? That was , well ... The stairs ? We were talking about the earthquake . What earthquake ? Wait a second . You didn 't see any ... - She 's one of them . - One of who ? Okay , everyone just hold on . She 's our friend , right , Izzy ? She 's not one of us . How do you know she 's not ? She said she 's not , okay ? Why are you defending her ? Because she 's my friend ! She 's my good friend ! Good friend , huh ? I guess I must be your best friend then , right ? What ? What do you mean , what ? I mean , you 're my girlfriend , not my friend . So we 're not friends ? No ! I mean , yes ! I mean ... I don 't think that 's what Arun is saying , Iz . So now you know what Arun thinks ! I didn 't say that . Maybe you shouldn 't say anything else . Stop ! We don 't have time for this , all right ? Let 's split up and see if we can maybe get some answers . Ari and I will go to the campus infirmary and confront the doctors . I have a feeling that they 've seen other cases like ours and they 're hiding it . Arun , you and Iz go to Campus Security . Find out why they 're after Elliott . Meet back here in an hour . Maybe we can piece this together . Let 's go . Oh , I almost forgot . How did you get this ? What is that ? Your room key ? Well , sort of . What do you mean , sort of ? Don 't play games with me , Arun . Is it yours or not ? What the hell is she doing with your key , Arun ? Go ahead , Arun . You can tell her . She told you her secret after all . You 're obviously okay with it . I 'm sure she 'll be fine with yours , too . Wait , what secret ? Oh , my God , I 'm sorry . - I thought you told him . - Told him what ? Tell me what ? Are you hiding something from me ? It sounds like you 're hiding something from me . No ! No , I have no idea what you 're talking about . Oh , you two never met for drinks . Why are you staring at me ? Never your kind before . - What kind ? - I shouldn 't have said that . That was incredibly insensitive of me . [ footsteps ] What is your problem with me ? You both need to come with me now . The Griefers are here and they 're looking for you both . Woo ! You think there 'll be some answers here ? There 's got to be answers somewhere . Oh , you 're still here . What seems to be the problem ? You don 't remember us ? We came in here earlier . My friend had fallen off a building and you couldn 't find anything wrong with him . Look , I know that our story seemed crazy and you probably didn 't believe it but now there 's a whole bunch of us who are just like him . Including me . - Are you sick ? - No , I 'm not sick . Would you like an exam ? No , I don 't want an exam ! Has anybody else come in with this story ? Come in , yes , by all means , come in . If you 're not feeling well , the nurse will be with you shortly . You 're not listening , okay ? We just fell down a flight of stairs . We should have broken our necks . A nurse will be with you shortly . We don 't want a damned nurse ! You don 't remember us at all ? A nurse will be with you shortly . Stop saying that ! Hey , stop ! Stop pretending like you don 't know anything ! What is going on around here ? A nurse will be with you shortly . [ sighs ] - What do they want with you ? - What do they want with you ? Look , I already know you went and saw them . I know you did too . I don 't know what they want with me . - I already joined . - You joined ? - How could you ? - I didn 't have a choice . Because of the secret you 're keeping from me . - What 's your excuse ? - I didn 't join ! They 're forcing you to join which means they know your secret ! What secret ? The one that Greta said you were gonna tell me about ! I can 't think of any secret ! I don 't even know why I 'm running ! But , you mean , you don 't remember ? I remember going to see them . They threatened they 'd tell you something if I didn 't join . I remember being worried but now I have no idea why . I wish somebody would tell me . Damn it ! Listen , hey . It 's gonna be okay , all right ? Look , we 'll figure this out . Will we ? We 've gotten this far , right ? Thank God , somebody to talk to ! There 's this guy , he just ... Well , I know this sounds crazy . But he blew up and then vanished . Continue . And there 's a bunch of us who have survived stuff that should have killed us . Some of these people , this doctor , they 're not even acting human . I know this sounds crazy but we 're telling the truth . - Are you a memory resident ? - What ? I said are you memory residents ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , fellas . Listen , we don 't want any trouble . - We just want answers . - Are you polymorphic ? - What are you talking about ? - We don 't understand . - Identify yourselves . - I 'm Becca . Ari . We said identify yourselves ! We just told you who we are ! - Are you Melissa ? - Are you deaf ? I just told you my name is Becca ! Sorry to bother you . We 'll just ... We have a Code 51 . We need to take care of them before they spread it to the others . [ rumbling ] It didn 't work . They need to be isolated . Don 't let them get away . Great . There 's nobody here . Maybe we can radio them . Wait . This plan is not gonna work . They 've already seen me . Look , I 'll go talk to them . You don 't even know why we 're here . You didn 't see anything . Arun and I will talk to them . He can 't . He 'll get kicked out . Is that true ? How did you even know that ? I was there . Yeah , and you were there at the Griefers too . - And the bar and the party . - So ? So don 't you think it 's strange that you seem to be everywhere we are ? It 's not an accident we met you , is it ? That 's ridiculous . You meant to knock on Arun 's door . That 's crazy ! Arun , are you really gonna believe someone who 's always lied to you ? One thing is sure . I know more about both of you than you do each other ! We have a problem here ? We want to know if anybody 's gone missing recently . What do you mean ? We mean , we want to know if someone 's gone missing . We want to know if there 's others . People leave all the time . No , he didn 't leave . The whole place was shaking and he disappeared out of nowhere . More like exploded . - You saw him disintegrate ? - Identify yourselves . - Izzy . - Arun . Shiva101 . You , over there . - We may have a Code 51 . - Code 51 ? Are you Melissa ? No , I just told you I 'm Izzy . - I 'm Arun . - Code 51 . Are you certain it 's a 51 and not an infraction ? Affirmative . 51 . We need to take care of them before they spread it to the others . [ rumbling ] Nothing . They need to be isolated . Arun , run ! You blocked us from our objectives . Your time here has now expired . I 'm sorry , okay ? Look , I know where they 're going . [ rumbling ] Can you hear me ? I said I know where they 're going ! Show us . They 're trying to destroy us like Elliott ! But it didn 't work ! Why didn 't it work ? Who cares ? I mean , they want to isolate us ? What the hell does that mean ? It means they want to keep us away from everyone ! What did we do ? It 's what they don 't want us to do . - Which is ? - Tell other people ! Tell who , Iz ? No one believes us ! Maybe they 're afraid someone will . - This is all your fault . - My fault ? This all started when you kissed me . When I kissed you ? - Where are you going ? - To warn Becca and Ari . - We need to get out of here ! - And abandon our friends ? I don 't know who you are . [ laughs ] That 's funny . I bet he doesn 't know who you are either . [ rumbling ] Yo ! These tremors , they mean you 're next , right ? Do I let your boyfriend in on your secret ? Why is this happening ? Who 's doing this to you ? Dude ? You know exactly what is happening . You figured you 'd wait me out . You 're crazy ! At least I 'm not some freak ! - I 'm going to tell him . - Go ahead and tell him . Everyone keeps talking about this secret . I 'd like to know what it is . Fine ! I lose , you lose . Your girlfriend 's not really your girlfriend . Izzy is actually ... She 's a ... No ! [ screaming ] Jennifer ! You came for free ! No ! What 's happening ? Arun , run ! Run ! Arun ! - What the hell ? - We 're back where we started . No , no , that 's not possible . I alternated turns so that wouldn 't happen . Let 's get out of here . Locked . Look ! Now what ? I 'm getting the hang of this . That tremor , that 's what happened to Elliott when he disappeared . That 's what they 're trying to do to us . Someone is controlling who stays and who goes . Security ? Izzy and Arun . Arun , thank God you 're okay ! We have to get out of here ! - Where 's Izzy ? - There 's more guys . They just vanished , just exploded ! - Code 51 ? - What does that mean ? Where is she ? Where is Izzy ? I don 't know . Greta , she just told me run and ... - You left her ? - Where is she , Arun ? They captured her . Izzy , they caught her . Where is Izzy ? The frat house , south side . Let 's go . You bitch ! Oh , nothing personal , Iz or whoever you really are . You were right about me . It was no coincidence that I showed up to Arun 's dorm room . We 've been promised to each other since birth , but I 'd never met him , and I was certainly not gonna get married in that way . So you lied to him . Don 't talk to me about lying ! I wanted what you want , what everybody wants . To fall in love . I only had two choices . Marry him or run away and leave my family . So I decided to see this man . Is he someone I could like ? Maybe love ? And ? There 's a lot of potential . He loves me . You do complicate things , but I couldn 't tell him the truth about you . Trashing your relationship was a good start but I couldn 't rely on that . I needed something else to get you out . Apparently , I 've found it . You blocked our objective . You will be terminated . But I got you this one . [ rumbling ] Please , don 't do this ! Not yet ! I still have things I can tell him ! I 'm not done yet ! - Greta ! - Arun ! Don 't worry , I 'll see you soon . There are the others ! No ! - Arun , she was one of them . - Come on ! Hold it right there ! - I think we 're okay . - Okay ? You call people exploding everywhere okay ? Let 's see . What 's the common thread between us and everyone else who 's been destroyed ? Okay , the Griefers were forcing people to join them . - Elliott was terrorizing me . - He was stealing from me . And Greta helped us escape from the guards . So what did we do ? I tried stealing from you . - You what ? - Elliott , he made me . How ? Everyone acted against the rules . Well , we didn 't . We tried to figure out what the hell was going on . So how come we didn 't get taken out ? I don 't know , but we need to find Izzy . [ footsteps ] Oh , crap ! We 're trapped ! Push ! What was that ? Thank Greta . How the hell do we get out of here ? We need to find Izzy ! We 're no good to her if we get caught ! Let 's get out of here . We 'll find help . - There must be an exit . - There ! They 're trying to get out . Good . [ chanting ] We 're back where we started ! Hey , you guys ! These guards are trying to shut you down ! These guys are trying to root us out ! Let 's go . It 's like they 're playing a game with us ! What 'd you say ? It 's like they 're playing a game . Do you go to school here ? Yeah . I figured out a way to cheat . A nurse will be with you shortly . - We don 't want a damn nurse ! - You don 't remember us at all ? A nurse will be with you shortly . We 're in a game . What ? We 're in a game . - This is crazy ! - What 's crazy ? Check this out . I 've never seen anything like it . We have got four separate viruses working at the same time . How is that possible ? I don 't know , but it 's not responding to the built-in antiviral software . - Should I quarantine it ? - I 've quarantined one , but it 's not letting me do anything with the others . Let 's try something a little stronger . That 's the best you can do ? A game ? It 's a little far-fetched , Becca . You think ? Hi . I 'm new here . What should I do ? Join a group . Go to class . And what about partying ? Just play by the rules . And what happens if I don 't ? - You get kicked out . - Kicked out of what ? The game . It 's impossible . Wait . The ones who don 't respond and give stock answers ? I think no-one 's playing them . So that means what ? No one 's playing us . Then we should be like them . We shouldn 't know we 're in a game . This should eliminate them . Hey , we 're alive in here ! - Yes . - What ? Before I stabbed you , you asked me to dinner . Yes . I have an idea . Are you crazy ? Sit down ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey , right here ! Come get me ! Come on ! Come on over here ! Shut it down ! You 're taking out the players ! Hey ! Hey ! Oh . Becca ! [ shrieks ] Izzy ! How ? I broke free . Oh ! What 's going on ? We 're fielding calls left and right about avatars getting blown from the game ? - It 's under control . - Yeah , it better be . What are we dealing with ? An incredibly advanced virus , really advanced . You know the one I had quarantined ? It broke through . What are you saying ? It adapted ? I mean , viruses can 't adapt . That would make them alive . [ knocking on door ] Arun ? I made you some tea . Thanks , Mom . You will have a visitor next week . - Yeah ? Who ? - Brianna . I can 't marry that . Papa ? Mommy ? I 'm not agreeing to marriage but I 'll go and meet Arun . [ groans ] Dude , what 'd you do that for ? I don 't know . Dude , we 're this close to having real life cyber sex ! I 've been chipping in all my allowance for this ! Come on , let 's just go . I don 't get you , man . [ sighs ] Good luck , Izzy . I 'm ready to meet Arun . What 's going on ? Where 's my Izzy ? I put in a tech service request six hours ago and reported this guy at the same time ! Hey , every minute that he is operating and I am not , I am losing money ! Calm down ? No , this is how I make my living ! I set myself up to do in-game sales totally according to your guidelines . No , okay ? Look , it is still not working . Like I told the other guy , I signed off for a few hours . I come back and I 'm locked out ! Fine , but it better be 10 minutes ! I have got to stop this guy . Say hello to Ari 2 . So why us ? I mean , how did we become alive ? I think I did it . You ? How ? My tear on Ari . Then I drank from Arun 's cup . And then I kissed Arun . But we 're not playing against the rules of the game like the others , we 're destroying the rules , the game . And they 're afraid we 'll infect everyone else . So who gave it to you ? No idea . So now what ? Nothing . There 's nowhere to run . They 're just gonna keep at us until they wipe us out . So , what ? We just turn ourselves over ? No . No , we can 't give up . We just have to let them know we 're alive . How ? We communicate with our makers . * We never liked the way you said about our situation * * We never really liked * The things you said and did at all * * You told us all we needed * * Was a little bit of patience * * But then we turned around and * * Found our backs against the wall * * So now we 're forced to find a way * * That we can turn the tables * So now we 're looking for a thing * * To help us find a way * We 'll keep on going * Just as long as we are young and able . * * We 'll keep on coming * Until we save the day * You need some instruction * Here comes some disruption * You need some instruction * Here comes some disruption * You put a thumb across * Our hopes and plans and aspirations * * Drop a conviction and a sentence * * On our only dreams * Your dirty trick and lying pricks * * Have reached the culmination * * We cannot take another crime , a con * * Another scheme * We 're set for giving back * All of the things we think we 're getting * * We 're set for taking back * Our pride and all our dignity * * We 're getting ready for a total Armageddon * * We 're getting ready though to get it * * Gonna set it free * You need some instruction * Here comes some disruption * You need some instruction * Here comes some disruption

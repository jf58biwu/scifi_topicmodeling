 Narrator : Previously on helix ... This is dr . Hiroshi hatake , director of research . Jane ! I love you , father . Daniel ! Man : The most likely scenario is some sort of infection contracted from the island . Woman : St. Germain . Man : We need to go there . You should know you 're trespassing on private property . I 'm michael . Welcome . ( screaming ) Be my path . Stop it . Stop ! 30 years ago , a pandemic began here on this island . Soren . ( grunting ) Somebody help her ! Woman : Alan 's here . He 's on the island . Can i speak with you , brother ... Jerome . Get peter and the other guy and get the hell out . I 'm still pregnant . I 've been pregnant for the last 15 months . Hey , soren . How are you feeling ? Good , i guess . You found what you were looking for ? No . Does this mean anything to you ? It 's a map of the island . What 's this right here ? A place you don 't wanna go . Soren : Landry , what are you doing ? Hello . ( screaming ) Cdc doctors are ... Anxious , they 're ... They 're concerned about the disappearance . Do they have anything to be concerned about ? What 's done is done . Isaac and soren have ... Completed their paths . Good . And michael ? He blames ann , he ... He 's afraid she 's Losing control . My mother 's control is an illusion , One we must keep providing for her . Of course . What if she finds out About us ? There is no us , landry . I 've told you many , many times . I misspoke . Forgive me . I think one of the scientists has taken a liking to me . The cute one , kyle . It seems the cdc is becoming a distraction for us all . We can 't have that . ( moaning ) No ... No distractions . It would be terrible if something unexpected were to happen to them . Say it , landry . ( moaning ) say it ! Something unexpected ... A terrible ... ( gasping and moaning ) I 'd say it 's about time we took matters Into our own hands . Wouldn 't you ? ( theme music playing ) ( birds chirping ) ( man singing ) ( singing ) Saw a mess of deer tracks near the creek base . Looks like they were moving at a pretty good clip . Something 's got 'em spooked . Feel free to turn up the radio . Oh , right , we don 't have one . Jaye likes it when i sing , don 't you , jaye ? It has a certain resonance that reminds me of singing . Father , someone 's coming . Inside . Both of you . Man : Michael ! Where is soren ? Soren is gone ? The boy , yeah . He 's missing . From your care ? I thought you had him under quarantine . ( sighing ) We ... Need a coordinated search of the grounds . I don 't have the manpower for that . Done . Do you know what i love about plant grafting ? The precision . The attention to detail . If the angles of the cuts don 't line up just right , The plant fails . Not enough humidity , And the scion won 't flower . But with practice , Plums on peach trees . Tomatoes grow in the snow . Huh , if only it were so easy with people . Unfortunately , the results are far less reliable Once you add freewill into the mix . I didn 't come here for botany 101 . Well then , Anything else ? No . That 's all for now . But if i find out you 're behind soren 's disappearance , I will hold you both responsible . Are we ? Absolutely not . The boy was placed in their care . Alone , without the balance of our family to reassure him . They wrapped him in plastic . I wouldn 't blame him for running off . We haven 't been seeing eye to eye lately . Unfamiliar territory for us , no ? My only thought is of what we have here And how to protect it . That 's what i want too . Sometimes , though , It helps to have fresh eyes On the situation , don 't you think ? Of course , but ... I think we should just call this a Difference of opinion . Sweet ann . I don 't know what i 'd do without you . ( bells tolling ) Testing to isolate and identify the pathogen continues . Specimen a is a patient with no known toxic exposure , Adult male , 32 years old , approximately 175 pounds . More like 160 . Been watching the carbs . ( sighing ) Additional lyses were used to test for the presence of known toxins against the samples Taken from the st . Germain subject , juvenile male , 10-years-old , approximately 95 pounds , Both during the symptomatic window and after remission . Samples failed to yield a result . This is like emptying the ocean with a teaspoon . It could take weeks to make an identification without an icp-ms . Ic what ? ( sighing ) Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry . Why didn 't you say so , hot zone ? Oh , please don 't call me that . Let 's try something different . Soren exhibited the same symptoms as the ship victims , right ? Ulcerating sores , scleral icterus ... That 's the yellow eyes for those of you playing at home . What if we match soren 's samples to the ship victims ' ? That way , we can ... That way , we can use competitive binding And find a match . Huh ! It might actually work . Okay , where are the ship samples ? Right here . Wait a minute . Where are they ? What 's wrong ? They 're not here . What 's not here ? The samples . Where did you last see them ? In the shack , when we found layla 's body . They must have fallen out . You 're kidding , right ? Those samples were everything . We can 't confirm the pathogen without them ! I 'll fix it . What happened ? Boy wonder here left the samples back at the shack . I 'll get them back . No , no . Hold on . We 'll go . Sarah , grab a field pack . No , this is on me . I should go . I need you here . You 've developed a rapport with amy . That 's one way of putting it . Okay . Use it . Find out if soren was acting strangely Before he attacked his mother . Narrow down the symptomatic window . See if you can find our missing kid . Hey . ( birds chirping ) I knew they would send someone . I did not think it would be you . It 's not what you think . A lot has changed since we last saw each other , father . Not as much as i would have hoped . Ilaria is gone . I was wrong to trust them . I know that now . You and i We 're on the same side . The immortals have scattered to the winds . Our time is over . The txm-7 pandemic is destroying us . I just wanna save the few who are left . Tell me why i should believe you . Because i 'm here . Unarmed . Believe what you want . Man : Hurry up with those barrels . Got a lot of work to do . Everything okay , jerome ? Yeah , fine . Why ? You 've raked the same spot three times now . I was just thinking how much i miss having a drink every once in a while . That 's your past life talking . Don 't worry , there 's no alcohol on the island . Michael forbids it . What 's with the wine barrels then ? No idea , except it 's not wine . What then ? Better not to ask . As michael says , Embrace your own path , not your neighbor 's . Amy , hey . About yesterday ... I 'm sorry if i gave you the wrong idea . ( scoffing ) how can an idea be wrong ? There 's no substance to it , just ... Air . If i hurt your feelings , it wasn 't my intention . ( laughing ) That 's what skeptics don 't understand about us . We 're free to explore our actions or reactions without blame or fear . Our actions to others , Others to us . We don 't limit our bodies or our thoughts . We use the space we 've created here to explore the darkness . Test it . We find the light . What if all you found was more darkness ? That 's just another discovery . Is it like that for the children ? Of course . The children are the most free . I 'm sorry you haven 't found the answers you 're looking for yet . I usually find them one way or another . Still . It must be difficult for you . Not really . You see , The cdc is real good at exploring the darkness . We have very bright flashlights . Right now , i 'd like to turn that light on your children . What 's your name , sweetheart ? Elizabeth , but everybody calls me lizzy . Did you know soren , lizzy ? He was in my class , But not anymore . That day , Before he went away , Was he acting kind of strange ? He said he was scared . Amy : Soren 's feeling much better now , lizzy . We talked about that . Okay , lizzy , this won 't hurt a bit . Can you open your mouth for me ? Like this , ahh ... ( laughing ) Maybe not quite like that . What was soren scared about ? I can 't say if amy 's gonna tell ... She won 't , i promise . He said he broke a rule . He didn 't want to go in the pit . What rule ? What 's the pit ? That should so it . Take care now . Next . Keep moving . We don 't want to be out here any longer than we have to . Seemed like a much better idea inside the giant electrified gates . Well , the sooner we get to the shack , the sooner we get back inside . You know , i 'm not so sure it 's that much safer inside . Alan said that the ... Dammit , sarah , you tried to talk sense into him , He told you to run . He 's manipulating you . He knows something about what 's going on on this island . You know what 's going on here ? A cdc investigation , and alan is no longer a part of that . Why shouldn 't he be ? We should bring him on . You still think he 's gonna ride in and save the day . I don 't need saving , peter . I 'm a scientist And i use my resources , and one of our best Is wasting his time picking apples and raking leaves . You have no idea what he 's up to . Neither do i . And that 's a good thing . How can you say that ? He 's your brother . He killed people , sarah . In paris . After arctic biosystems , he became obsessed . He couldn 't think of anything but julia . I 've heard the rumors . It 's more than rumors . Interpol has security cam footage of him Leaving ilaria 's corporate headquarters Just before a bomb went off . Maybe he thought he was creating a diversion , Maybe he didn 't expect people to be there , But they were . Innocent people . Immortals . Immortals . Just like you . Alan 's not the man he used to be , And it 's time we all face that . Lock it . Wouldn 't get too close . What is that ? Seraphim 's breath . The mayans used it in human sacrifice . One whiff , And people would literally cut their own throats . Funny , isn 't it ? Nature gives us freewill , And then it gives us the ability to take it away . Michael and ann know about this ? Of course not . They 're afraid of anything they can 't control . Maybe they should be a little more friendly , hmm ? What do i do with this ? ( children laughing ) Children . Children ! Gather round . Who wants to play a game ? I do ! What 's it called ? Time machine . Who wants to go first ? All : Me ! Okay , lizzy . Just breathe , lizzy . Who wants to go next ? Children : Me ! Layla 's body 's gone . You don 't suppose somebody came from the abbey to pick it up And then never got around to telling us , do you ? Somebody definitely came to get it , But i don 't think it was anyone from the abbey . I 've found the samples . You know , the competitive binding idea that kyle had Was really inspired . Hopefully it will give us some clues . ( loud banging ) ( growling ) hey , come on ! ( banging and growling ) I can smell you right now ! Get the samples ! ( screaming and banging ) Come on ! The window ! ( growling furiously ) Go , go , go ! ( growling ) Fresh meat ! ( gunshots ) Come on , come on ! She can 't be trusted . You know that , right ? She 's my daughter . Part of me is happy to see her . And the other part ? She betrayed us once . Much time has passed . You don 't see clearly where she 's concerned , you never have . I know what she is . I made her that way . You know what you have to do . I don 't need a lecture from you . I will discover her true intentions . Then what ? Then ... I will do what is necessary . I 'm glad you finally found some peace . Last time we saw each other , that wasn 't the case . Finding peace is very difficult . Especially for our kind . You 've been on this island a long time . There isn 't much peace to be had these days . For anyone . Then i 'm lucky to pass my days here . You still find immortality lucky ? Why else would i have given it to you ? I sometimes wish you hadn 't . It doesn 't matter . You are here now . You drugged me . Why is soren 's blood sugar so high ? Dr. Kyle ! Lizzy ? What 's wrong ? Come quick ! The children are sick . Please , hurry . Where are the children ? Lizzy ? ( upbeat music playing ) Lizzy ? What 's wrong ? ♪ i think i 'll go for a walk outside now Hey , kids . ♪ the summer sun 's callin ' my name ♪ i hear you now , i just can 't stay inside all day ♪ i gotta get out , get me some of those rays What are you guys doing out here ? ♪ everybody 's smilin ' ! Sunshine day ♪ everybody 's laughing ! Sunshine day ♪ everybody seems so happy today ♪ it 's a sunshine day ♪ i think i 'll go for a walk outside now ♪ the summer sun knows me by name , he 's calling me ... ♪ Man : Can i help you with something ? Yeah , i was told to bring these here . By who ? This isn 't produce storage ? You want the red building . Other side of the orchard . Oh ! ( chuckling ) I 'm new to the picking crew . I thought they said here . Well , they were wrong . You told us there were bears out there , not people ! I 'm sure there 's a simple explanation . Whatever you think you saw ... Don 't try to tell me that you don 't know what 's going on On your goddamn island ! Peter ... It 's dr . Farragut . I 'm only trying to tell you that there are no creatures outside . It wasn 't a creature , it was a man . A very sick man Who was exhibiting stage-2 symptoms of the pathogen , Along with necrotic lesions . It 's like ergot poisoning , A fungal toxin that produces psychosis Along with severe physical symptoms . How could you not tell us there are people in the woods ? Well ... Some people choose to leave the abbey . They come because they 're tired of living dishonest lives , But if they reject their true path , Often there 's nowhere for them to return . So you just throw them out to fend for themselves ? No one is thrown out . I only help them see That they are their decisions . Once made , They have to live with them . Or die by them ? If that 's their path . Peter : Based on what we saw , the pathogen is outside the gates . The question is , where did it come from ? You 're assuming it started outside . How 's that ? What if it was the other way around ? You think the source is inside the abbey ? They 're doing some pretty heavy duty botanical work here . Hybrid breeding , seed manipulation ... They 're combining traits of different plants to create entirely new variants . You mean like gmos ? They don 't have the technology ... They don 't need it . Grafting 's been around for centuries . Gregor mendel was crossbreeding pea plants in the 1850s , At an abbey not unlike this one . Oh , my god ! Oh , jesus ! Kyle ! Kyle , can you hear me ? Kyle ! We need to get him on his back . Come on , buddy . Airway clear , breathing normal . There 's so much blood . We 've got to find the source . Here . Hey ! Kyle , come on , buddy ! Sunshine day . Kyle , it 's peter . What happened ? How long have i been out ? I don 't know . My head is killing me . You 've got a nasty laceration . Ow ! Payback 's a bitch . Who did this to you ? You wouldn 't believe it if i told you . Hell , i don 't believe it . The kids . The kids ? All of them , acting together . They left me for dead and i dragged myself back here . I 've seen angry mobs before . This was something else . They were ... Blank . Like a trance ? Maybe some kind of brainwashing . Cults are notorious for their mind control techniques . Their eyes ... The pupils Were darting side to side . Quick , repetitive movements . Nystagmus , an involuntary nerve condition . Where are the kids now ? Don 't know , why ? I 'd like to see them for myself . ( whimpering ) ( hatake humming ) Good . You 're awake . My arm ... What ... What did you ... It 's sodium pentothal . What ? Why ? You should have told me the truth . Julia ? Hmm ... Tell me . Why are you here ? A cure . For what ? Immortals dying . That 's not possible . I 'm dying . Julia ? Hmm ... Julia . Tell me who you work for . Hmm ... Julia ! Who do you work for ? Ilaria . ( children laughing and talking ) They seem fine . Lizzy : Dr. Kyle ! What happened ? Did you get hurt ? One minute they attack me with rocks , and the next , they wanna kick a ball around ? Soren experienced a similar recovery from the pathogen . I 'm telling you , this was different . What could have caused that kind of attack ? I don 't know . Somebody wants us off this island . Permanently . Right there . There it is . You get something ? Lower left quadrant , 400x . Peter : It 's definitely a fungus . Not one i 've ever seen before . Which means that we have no idea what it 's capable of . We need to bring alan in on this . Whoa , no , no ! No , we talked about this . Alan ... Farragut ? He 's handled hundreds of investigations . He 's here ? On the island ? He 's here . Pretending to be one of the followers . The last thing we need is another variable , And alan is just that . We need all the help we can get . Not his kind of help . We 've got a limited time to get a handle on this , Or a lot more people are gonna die . With alan , at least we have a chance . Okay . But let me talk to him first . Alone . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah , my eyes ! What is it ? My eyes ! Someone help me ! What 's happening , brother ? ( shouting ) Hatake : ( muffled ) ... Do what is necessary . Daniel : How ? Hatake : You need to trust me to do what is right . The decision is mine ! Stay out of sight . I will decide what to do . Daniel , don 't be so dramatic ! You know i 'm right . What are you waiting for ? It 's more complicated than that . Isn 't it , hiroshi ? You said you 'd do what you had to do . It 's time . Hatake : I do not want to discuss this now . Go ahead , tell him . Tell me what ? You 're choosing her ? Again ? Hatake : Bringing you here is proof enough . You are my son . And she is our daughter . We can make her understand . She 's a strong woman , but she 'd burn down the house to clean the stove . We can make her see there 's another way . Don 't do this , hiroshi . She doesn 't belong here . Dan ... ( door slamming ) ( gasping ) I thought you 'd never wake up . What is this ? Where are my clothes ? You look very pretty . Are you ready ? You were right to come to me . I can save you . But first , meet your family . What family ? There 's no one here . Say hello to your mother and brother ! ( screaming )

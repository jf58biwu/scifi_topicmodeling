 So our guy 's into body mod . Is that what the cheek 's about ? Black female , white male . Where did they kill Basspair86 ? An ambulance . They 're not gonna be happy about any of this . Think I could borrow a little surveillance gear on the DL ? You convinced me my boyfriend 's a spy . Just tell me what you want . You end it , you coward ! What is happening with you ? - Ah ! - Ugh ! This is Detective Duko . He 's with the union . Don 't you worry , Detective . Topside pursues its profits , the military pursues its weapons , and we steer it all from within . Neolution . I assume you have a plan to hide your dear mom . I might . Faraway . I don 't need to know where . Sarah Manning , my name is MK . Neolution knows where you are . Come on , babe , we 've gotta go . Sarah , could you just slow down ? Get dressed , Kira . Christ on the cross ! What 's all the racket ? You know what time it is ? Sarah had a call . They said we 've been compromised . Who exactly is MK ? I don 't know . She 's one of us . She said she knew Beth . How does she know that the Neos have found us ? She didn 't say . She just bailed on Art . Sounds bloody fishy to me . Kira , come on . Come on . - Come on , babe . - What about Daddy ? He 's out of the country still . We 'll get word to him soon . Look , I know none of it makes any sense , but we don 't have a choice , do we ? Sarah , we have been so careful . We have covered our tracks . - No one knows we 're here . - Then why would she call ? Could be the Neos trying to flush us out . Maybe , but I still think we should go . Let 's just get our heads before we do anything , love . Okay ? Let me reach out first . I 'll see if my people have heard anything . Mommy . Sorry , babe . They 're coming . Jesus , Mary and Joseph . Get in the truck . - Come on . - You know what to do . S , they can 't find anything . They won 't . Not even an eyelash . Get them all in the truck . Take this . Go . Ah ! Ball change . Work it out . Lift up . Pop it right . Whack it out . Grab . Roll . - Yes ! Ah ! - Woo ! - Yes ! - All right . One more time for good luck . Then we ' re gonna move through . - And five . Here we go ! - Holy Dinah . Scott ! Step back . Whoa , take it easy . I was expecting a friendly face . Siobhan . Apologies . Any friend of Benjamin 's ... We 're here . It 's good . Hey - Two houses up in flames inside three months , eighteen hours in the arse of a cargo plane , stuffed in a van in the dark . Christ , I need a fag . Okay . - Right , this is it then ? - This is it . We 're nearly there , babes . Benjamin 's gonna take you and Kendall to the safe house , and I 'll meet you later . When you 've settled her in , you come back here for a check-up . - I don 't need a check-up . - You 're having one anyway . Are we gonna meet Cal at the safe house ? Uh , I told you , we 're not gonna see him for a while . Kira . Babe . Come on . Monkey . She 'll be fine , love . She just needs to understand . This is it ? Are they serious ? I don 't know . I 'd say it 's a half-decent front by the smell of it . I mean , no one 's stumbling in here by accident . I doubt you two are here for the latest issue of Rot Ruin . Call me Hell Wizard . Hell Wizard , that 's lovely . I think you might wanna check out what we have downstairs . Oh , brilliant . It 's like the bloody Batcave in here . - Hey ! - Hey ! Hey , Sarah ! Hey , welcome to the Rabbit Hole . It 's really good to be here , Scott . Thanks . How you doing ? You all right ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm good . Secret lab under a comic book shop . What more could a girl want , right ? I 'm good , seriously . Good . Welcome home , sestra . Well , I 'm terribly happy you 're back , Sarah , but how did this mysterious MK know they were coming for you ? That 's the question , isn 't it ? Up until yesterday , it was all quiet on the Iceland front . - Yeah , same here . - Too quiet . Well , I 'm completely overbooked . I have no time for Neos . You might have to make some . Hey , so , uh , Beth never mentioned anybody called MK ? No . But you knew her best , Alison . No , she never said anything to me . But she didn 't share every little thing . I mean , she protected us . Like , from a clone in a mask ? What 's up with that ? Art just said she wore a sheep mask . Oh , right . - What ? - Uh , Dolly the sheep . For the record , I do not find that even remotely amusing . MRS. - How did you set this place up ? The Hendrixes ponied up the cash . Some of the gear we got on Craigslist , but most of it magically migrated from the Dyad before they locked us out . Well done , Scott . Everyone else we know got fired or relocated . As far as we know , Dyad 's out of the clone game . So who 's running the experiment now ? I guess we are . Huh . Cosima looks ... She looks weaker . We 're getting closer with the gene therapy . With Kendall 's genome , we 've been able to isolate the synthetic sequences . What about the other thing ? Any word on Delphine ? Still nothing . Oh , yeah . Purple this time ? - Thanks , Cos . - Mmm-hmm . Sarah , have you spoken to Felix at all ? I 'm trying . He won 't return my calls . Hey , um ... I 'm taking Helena . What should I tell her ? Just don 't tell her they 're back . She 's occupying enough space and time as it is . - Fine . Okay . - Go . I have a Playground Safety Committee meeting . I 'm sorry . Have we thought of next steps ? Yeah , Sarah , I 'm not sure that home is the wisest place to run from Neolution . Well , I can 't run at all if I don 't know who Neolution is . MK does , so I think we start with her . She was weird , man . I 'm sorry I didn 't get more out of her , but she bolted on me . Her accent sounded Scandinavian to me . Yeah , European and something . What else you got ? I know you got something else . Jesus . It 's the last case Beth and I caught . He 's got one white contact lens . Yeah , and someone surgically removed his cheek then neatly buried him . Jesus Christ , is that his ... Self-modification , yeah . What ? - He 's Neolution then ? - Don 't know . We got kicked off the case before we could find out . What I do know is that Beth received an anonymous tip that led us to the body . And you think that tip was from MK ? You know , the bottom line is I have no friggin ' clue what Beth was up to . I do know that if we wanna find out ... Her flat ? Her flat . What 's all this ? Landlord said the place is in Paul 's name . Rent paid through the end of the year . Right . Paid by Dyad . How come no one picked up her stuff ? Well , the station said her family was gonna take care of it . Well , let 's see what 's here . - You all right with this ? - No . But it 's where we 're at . Shiitake mushrooms . Felix ! Hey , Alison . - What are you doing downtown ? - I 'm visiting you . Is that a penis ? In art , it 's called a phallus , darling . Well , it 's really coming along , this thing . Alison , why are you here ? You haven 't been answering your calls , mister . Do you even know that your family 's back ? Yeah . They 're all right , aren 't they ? Yes , but that 's not the point . Why didn 't you go meet them ? 'Cause I 'm in the zone . They can come to me . You have to tell them what you 've been up to . I will when the time 's right . Just tell them . Explain it . They 'll be supportive . I don 't know . - What ? - City marathon . Yeah , she ran it a few times . No way I 'd run 26 miles unless someone were chasing me . You and Beth are more alike than you think . You 're both stubborn as hell . So she probably kept investigating after she was suspended . Beth never let anything go . That 's what made her a good cop . I don 't have anything special . I wasn 't expecting company . - Beer ? - No , thanks . On duty . I didn 't think the union did home visits . But this is a special case , isn 't it , Beth ? How you holding up ? I 'm good . Who doesn 't like a little paid leave ? Go to the gym . Get a little , uh , light reading done . - Is this any good ? - just skimmed it . It all smells like bullshit to me . You are killing me . Poking around with these high level people . I went to Leekie on a case . Well , now , you 're off the case . But you keep digging . and digging and digging . So what do you think is gonna happen if you keep picking at this scab ? I don 't know . Story of my life . Oh , that 's good . You 're good . But we 've crossed a line , you and me . And there 's really no going back . Because I have to keep everyone that I care about safe . And you want that , too , don 't you , Beth ? Anything ? Not a damn thing . Nothing in the bedroom , either . So she was onto Neolution . Probably through MK . And she met Leekie . " Good luck in your investigations . " It is good of you to come play my boyfriend . No , no , I am not your boyfriend . You are playing my wife . - Mr. and Mrs. Hendrix ? - Yes . Yeah , right here . Uh , yeah , I got everything filled out . Great . I 'll just need your health card , Mrs. Hendrix . You know what ? I 've got that right here . Here you go . She 's changed her hair , obviously . Because it was too ugly . Well , it looks lovely now . If you 'll follow me , we 'll get you into a room . Great . So , Mrs. Hendrix , how have you been feeling ? A little tired and many farts . I can assure you that 's perfectly normal . But never when having sex with my boyfriend . Husband . Me , her husband . Um , we have sex , because she 's my wife . Well , that is how all this happened . Am I right ? You are right . So right . Don 't worry , there are many safe positions you can practice well into your pregnancy . - Oh , good . - What ? It 's nice to take your blood again , Kendall . Last time for a while , I 'm afraid . We 've got to keep her on the move . They all want a piece of me . - You need some sun . - Ma ! She 's the one that should be getting pricked and prodded . I thought my DNA was supposed to make you better . Yeah , it takes time , uh , to develop a therapy . We still need the right viral vector to deliver it . Could you take another stem cell treatment from Kira ? I mean , just in the meantime . I can 't start a new gene therapy trial if I 'm already taking other treatments . It 'll skew the whole data set . Well , you two are gonna have a breakthrough . I feel it . If the bloody Neos don 't murder us all first . Ma ... What ? It 's true . " The individual can only begin " the journey to the extraordinary " by casting off the genetically-mandated human shell . " Cast it off for what ? For whatever they provide , I guess . Cosima calls it sound bite science . Jesus , Beth . Sarah , come see this . What , you found something ? Yeah , something I don 't think anybody was supposed to see . - Is that a camera ? - Yeah , Paul spying on her . Actually , I think Beth was spying on Paul . When I was her , I found surveillance equipment . She got it from Raj at the station . He had a crush on her . Okay . Yeah , here we go . Okay , let 's see what secrets you 're keeping , shall we ? - I will really see my baby ? - That 's the idea . Oh , my God . This is so cool . This looks like mush . Is that a foot ? Is ... No , that 's a ... No , that 's a foot . Okay , here we go . - That 's it . - My little baby . Okay , that 's strange . What ? Strange ? What is strange ? Sorry . I didn 't see it before because it 's lying along the bottom . The other one . Congratulations . You 're having twins . - Twin babies ? - Identical twins . Hey , you okay ? Look , they 're fighting . I have to tell my sestra . Jesus Christ ! She was really losing her shit . I knew that she and Paul were having problems , but nothing like this . After she got suspended , she wouldn 't return any of my calls . It 's not your fault , Art , what happened to her . Beth took that on herself . Who 's this pregnant girl ? I don 't know , but she looks upset . Wait , wait , wait . Stop . Look ! One white eye . She 's Neolution , too . So Beth looks into Leekie , then meets with one of his followers ? And MK 's maybe steering her . They 're not telling the others . You need to tell me what you find out . Whoa , whoa . Where the hell are you going ? Back to the beginning of all this shit . Felix ! Oh . My God ! Hi . I called you six bloody times . Why didn 't you answer me ? 'Cause my phone 's been off . I just got in and up to speed . Can you hand me the towel , please , so this gets a little less Flowers in the Attic ? Please , cover your willy . So , uh , Kira 's good ? And S ? No and yes . - We made it . - Yeah . Let 's go grab a drink , and I will catch you up . Can I just get a bit of space ? Thanks . I just figured that , you know , I 'd give you guys a day to settle in , and then I 'd come see you all tomorrow . Well , I haven 't slept since yesterday , so get dressed and let 's go to the bar . I missed your face . Yeah , I guess we can pop down to Bobby 's for a nip . I have another place in mind . Club Neolution . Are you kiddin ' me ? - I need to find this girl , and ... - I know . You need to find this girl so that you can find the other girl . And you can 't exactly walk through the door with that face again , can you ? - Right . - Good . Fine . Meet me around back then . I 'm getting you in , but I 'm not paying bloody cover , am I ? Thank you . See , same placenta . That 's how they know they 're identical . Well , how is she gonna deal with that ? That 's twice the work . Yeah , and doubly awesome . Bin , please . This is Helena we 're talking about , dear . She eats frozen bread and she 's murdered people . Well , so have we . That 's different . Helena 's trained to kill people . We 're manslaughterers . Oh , Lord , listen to me . Honey ... Are you upset because of our issues ? No ! I 'm happy for her . Even though she 's eating us out of house and home , and now she wants to " do the crafts : Look at the state of this place ? - I mean , I have a system . - Ali . She 's bringing flies in here , because there 's food everywhere ! Ali . - What ? - She just wants to be like you . I 'm overjoyed for her . Could you just make sure that Fertile Myrtle hasn 't eaten all the jelly fruitcake for the school district social ? Yeah . God , this place still makes my skin crawl . Really ? I thought your tail would be wagging , so to speak . Don 't remind me , please . You do realize that if this girl was pregnant , like , six months ago , that she could be home , changing nappies by now . Yeah , well , someone must know her , right ? So let 's just ask around . Right . I 'll start with the bar . She still on , like , a pack a day ? Quite easily . - If you can 't beat ' em , join ' em ? - Mmm-hmm . No ? It 's medicinal grade . We have a little crop right there . Totally organic . Does it help with the appetite ? Yeah . That 's about all it helps with , though . You want to talk about it , chicken ? Oh , God . Please don 't call me chicken . I love that . I need you to tell me that Delphine is alive . I can 't do that , love . The last time I saw her , it felt like she knew something bad was gonna happen . But that doesn 't mean that it did . We both know that this is a war , right ? That means anything can happen . I just miss her so much . - Those my test results ? - Huh ? You 've got a shite poker face , even for a grad student . Ex-grad student . It 's your WBC count . It could be nothing , or it could be an indicator . It 's leukemia . I was diagnosed months ago . Before Iceland . Before any of this . Siobhan doesn 't know . And you 're not going to tell her , neither . I just found my kin . All you get when everyone knows you 're dying is a pity party . Patient 's privilege ? - She looks pregnant . - Yeah . Do you know her ? Her name 's on the tips of my tongue . Very cute . - Whoa . - Any joy ? I was getting drinks . This would go a lot faster if you helped . I was getting drinks . - What 's your problem ? - Oh , okay , now you ask . Yeah , ' cause you 're being a bitch . Is it boy trouble or what ? Really ? Are you serious ? Boy trouble ? What ? I 'm all ears . I 've been looking for my birth family . - What ? - Yeah . I made the decision while you were away . We asked you to come . It 's not about that . It 's about me finding out who I am . Me , S , Kira . That 's your family , Fee . No , that 's your family . You 're related to bloody everyone , including our foster mum . Go figure that . - You belong with us , Fee . - No . I belong on the dance floor . MK . Jesus . I thought that was you . What are you doing here ? You get my message ? What , you couldn 't wait an hour ? Well , come on . You wanna see it that bad , let 's go take a look . I never thought I 'd see you in a place like this with actual people . Will you just show me ? Well , I put the word out like you asked . Friend of mine was scrubbing around , lifted this from an offshore server . It was shot in Bogota two weeks ago . I 've heard rumors of high-level Neos with implanted tech , but , this is next level . It 's organic , maybe even gene-spliced . - Jesus . - Oh , it gets worse . Yeah , it has a built in defense mechanism . Kills the host . - Well , what does it do ? - I don 't know . You 're the one who put me onto it . What 's going on , MK ? Wait a second . Who are you ? - Christ , let go of me ! - Who are you ? Piss off . Hey , leave it for Felix . Felix , I 'm sorry . We 'll talk about everything later . Right now , I 'm gonna try and meet MK . You can do it . You can do this . You can do this . Beth , what the hell are you doing ? MK ? Shit . Thanks a lot . I 'm sorry . - Hello ? - Where 's Dizzy ? - He sent me . - Liar . You shouldn 't be here , Sarah . Wait , you can see me ? Where are you ? Up . Look UP - Up , UP , up ! Up' Put your other phone in the dryer . Close the door . You want me to put my phone in the dryer ? If they 're listening , it will cut the signal . Boots on the counter , side by side , where I can see them . You have three minutes . How did you know that they were coming after us in Iceland ? - I listened . - To what ? They 're careful . Using offshore servers , pinging false IPs . I cast a net deep , and there it was . Your name ... And Kendall Malone , too . I knew they 'd find you . Thank you for that . You saved our lives . We need to know what we 're up against , MK . No , I can 't talk to you any more . Why not ? Because it will kill you . It will kill you like it killed Beth . Please , no.1 , uh ... I 'm sorry . I came in the back . It 's me . Jesus , Mika . It was locked , but ... The sliding doors are not so hard to open if you 're familiar . Please , Beth , it 's been four days . Why didn 't you answer ? You 're bleeding . It 's not mine . Beth , please . Beth , where have you been ? Open up . Talk to me , please . Open up , please . Tell me what happened . Go home , Mika . Beth , please , open up . Talk to me . Beth . Why did you go dark ? I checked the data logs , incoming and outgoing . You haven 't called the others , either . You 're screening my calls now ? I was worried . I wanna help you . You can 't . It 's over ! We 're done . I 'm done ! I screwed it up . We can 't fight this any more , Mika . You need to drop all this . Go back into hiding . Drink iced tea , play video games , whatever . Just stay hidden . Please , don 't leave me . I need you . Watch the others for me . That was the last time I saw her . That was the night she killed herself . She was my friend . She called me Mika . Mika ... Why 'd she jump ? What did she find out ? She wouldn 't tell me . Was it something to do with those implant things ? The maggot-bots ? Yes . They 're part of it . Yes , yes ! What are they for ? No . No , no , no . Beth said to hide . - Hide your family . - Hiding doesn 't work , Mika . Oh , shit . You 're here . Wait . Hey ! Mika . Hey ! Hey ! Um , Mika , wait ! Wait ! Please ! Mika ! Let go of me ! Get off ! No . Get off me ! Help ! Help ! Quiet ! We 've been looking for you a long time . Don 't fight it . What do you want ? It 's not her . - What 's your name ? - Piss off ! - No . No ! - Open up . You bite me , I will snap your neck . I just need to check something . - Where 's the bathroom ? - Hey . - What ? - Hey , hold on . We 've got a protocol ... Bugger off , Benjamin ! Where 's the bathroom ? It 's down there . What 's going on ? I don 't know . You ask her . Okay . Thanks , Ben , but I 've got this . Sarah ? What is it ? When Dyad had me , did they do something to me ? Like what ? What are you talking about ? Mommy , what 's wrong ? - Oh , my God . - Now look . No , they had you , too . - Just , just ... - Hey . Kira , open your mouth . Now ! - Ow ! You 're hurting me . - Wide . Wider ! Sarah , stop it ! Just go into bed , love . I 'll be in in a minute . Would you mind just telling me what has gotten into you ? I think there 's something inside me . I need a torch . Slow down . Tell me what happened . They have these implant things . And these Neos , they attacked me . - They were looking for MK . - What ? And I think - there 's something in my jaw . - Okay , okay . - Here . - Easy , let 's have a look . Jesus , Sarah . What is that ? I don 't know . I don 't know . What is that God-forsaken thing ? - Is it harming Sarah ? - Holy cow ! It looks like it 's latched on . Oh , you 're expecting Felix ! Who are you ? Mrs. Hendrix ? We 're investigating a triple homicide in a local garage a few weeks back . We all need to work harder at being a family . If ! Can 't find MK , I need to find this Dizzy guy . Maybe he knows how to take it out . All right , who the hell are you ?

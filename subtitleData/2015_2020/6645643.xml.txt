MALE NEWSCASTER : Odessa , a once thriving city in Central Texas , is reduced to a desolate wasteland by a cowardly act of Eve-terrorism . Password ? Cockroach ? MALE NEWSCASTER ' . Why Odessa ? It was the headquarters of Primatech , a company steeped in secrecy . Primatech opened its doors on June 13th for what was to be a three day summit . People gathered from all around the world , hoping to build a better future , where humans and Evos could co-exist in peace . Within hours , an Evo-supremacist named Mohinder Suresh claimed full responsibility for the attacks . Lies , all of it . WOMAN 1 : This is pathetic . How the hell are we supposed to fight back if we can 't even organize ? We just got to get creative . There 's a guy in Los Angeles fighting back . Calls himself " El Vengador . " A dude in a Mexican wrestler costume . That 's a joke , right ? Is it ? At least he 's doing something . I hear he 's got a whole underground railroad out there . Fake ID 's , fake blood samples . It 's a way to disappear . One guy , so what ? Pretty soon they 'll send drones after us . WOMAN 2 : June 13th changed everything . Public 's scared to death of us . COACH LEWIS : Most of these incidents are isolated . Tulsa , Cedar Rapids . They 're vigilantes , a few bad apples . That 's all . If it was just vigilantes , the government wouldn 't be forcing us to register . People don 't get it . It 's not the government or the vigilantes we should be worried about . The ones who 're really hunting us ? They 're in the shadows . There 's something else going on here . And they 're everywhere . Well , that 's just great . So what are we supposed to do with that ? Chase ghosts ? My mom sleeps with a gun under her pillow , when she sleeps at all . And we use fake names most of the time . ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm calling myself Tommy now . No names for God 's sakes .

That 's a good one . On June 13th , my wife and I , we brought our 9-year-old son , Dennis , to Odessa to watch history being made . It was a beautiful day , sun was shinin ' , summer heat was risin ' up off the ground . Like everyone there , we believed in the cause , we believed that the change could come from that spot , right then and there . And then when I watched my ... My boy die in my arms , I realized ... ( STUTTERS ) That just wasn 't gonna happen . You all seem like really nice folks . You can 't change who you are , what you are , but these powers , they 're not natural . They 're not safe , and they cannot be trusted . So as far as I 'm concerned , there 's only one solution for that . And what solution is that ? It 's a trap ! They found us .

The ones that make you believe you know the truth , they 're the dangerous ones . The ones that hold you hostage .

I 've been here an hour now . The other guy told me to wait . Mmm . Waiting . Too many people go through life waiting for things to happen instead of making them happen . Ah . Now ... Let 's talk about what you saw . I 'm riding my bike down H Street with my delivery when this little prick runs right into me . $ 28 worth of food on the ground . He came runnin ' out of that church , right before it caught fire , so I 'm guessing he killed all those people . Could you identify this " prick " if you saw him again ? Is there a reward ? Go ahead . I don 't understand . What 's this for ? Penny for your thoughts . All right , so let 's see if we can get a description of that kid you saw . Kid ? Sorry , I don 't remember anything about a kid . Excuse me , Miss , can I help you ? That depends . Okay , now for your favorite subject .

( INCOMING TEXT ALERT ) EMILY : I 've got French club so ... BRAD : Want me to pick you up ? EMILY : Sure . CARLOS : Come on , hurry up . Let 's go . Why don 't you ever stay with us when you 're in town ? Uh , it 's complicated . If you came back , you could work at the shop . I don 't know . I think your dad 's still pretty sore at me . He 's probably over it now that you 're a hero . Hero . ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) But ... You 're like El Vengador . What , the guy in the Mexican wrestling mask ? ( SCOFFS ) Are you comparing me to an Evo ? They say anyone can turn out to be an Evo . You 're just born that way . There 's this website called Hero Truther , and they 're tracking how all these Evos are starting to disappear . Someone 's taking them , maybe even killing them . El Vengador 's the only one taking care of this neighborhood . The only one the gangbangers are scared of . All right . I 've heard enough about El Vengador . I 've seen enough , too . ls that yours , Jose ? Yes . Yes . But people need to know he 's not in hiding like the rest of them . No , people need to come to a garage without graffiti on the wall . Now clean it up . ( ENGINE STARTING ) So the kid 's got a hero , someone to look up to . What 's the problem ? El Vengador isn 't everybody 's hero . The tag is bad for business .

You know something about June 13th that nobody else does . Let me guess , you 're a Truther . An apologist for Mohinder Suresh ? ( SCOFFS ) And ... What do you ... Suresh had nothing to do with Odessa . He 's a patsy . How do you not know that , man ? What did they do to you ? Get a life . Stay out of mine . Wait , I have the manuscript . Suresh was just about to publish . And how the hell do you have that ? It 's all in here . How the number of Evos is higher on the planet than ever before . These powers , their numbers are increasing . Escalating ! Why ? ( SIGHS ) ls it evolutionary ? Is it because they wanna take over , like the media , like the government , like , wants us to think ? No . They 're here to save us . " Save us " ? From whatever it is that Renautas is planning . If that 's true , then where are they , huh ? Do you see any people with powers around here ? They are all gone ! They are hiding or dead . Believe me . If they were here to save us , I would know . ( SIREN BLARING ) Listen to me , man . Oh ! You called the cops ? That 's him !

When I was , like , seven , these people took me to this place because of my power . I remember a room filled with toys and stuff . No windows . It was kind of hazy . I think about it all the time .

Seemed ironic some tech giant like Renautas , like , buy into some tiny paper company like Primatech . Why 'd you stop working at Primatech ? Was it because Renautas bought the company ? No . I left after the summit . After ... That 's right . Your daughter , uh , I 'm sorry . I was there June 13th . How did I survive ? I thought that I didn 't remember because of the trauma of the explosion , but ... ( SIGHS ) Claire was there , too . And I didn 't save her . And I have to know why . No , I 'm pretty sure Renautas was behind the whole slaughter . That 's not what the world believes . You knew Mohinder Suresh . Was he capable of mass murder ? No . But why is he running ? Why is Renautas framing , disappearing , and killing evolved humans ? That 's why I came to find you . I figured if anybody had answers , it was you . Do you ? What ? Odessa .

You must be my good luck charm . ( BLOWS LIGHTLY ) MAN : Seven ! ( WOMAN LAUGHS ) Uh , you know what ? We are attracting the wrong kind of attention . Why don 't we take this party somewhere else ? I 'll cash out , we can grab a drink back at my hotel . Love to . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Not interested . I 'm watching The Biggest Loser . Ah , schadenfreude . I understand the attraction . I 'm here to discuss an opportunity that I think you will find pretty darned attractive . What do you say you invite me in and crack us each a tallboy ? CARLOS : " The Evo vigilante , El Vengador , " killed three police officers . " There was an anonymous report of a women being ra ... Raped . " Patrolman Eugene Pakowski identified the assailant . " Eugene Pakowski . ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) Let 's have another drink . Now that is a good idea , Zoe . ( GLASSES CLINKING ) To my good luck charm . ( CHUCKLES ) Luck . We both know your run tonight had nothing to do with luck . What are you talking about ? MOLLY : You were either cheating , or you have powers . You don 't seem smart enough to have a system . I work for the Dragon Lounge . Ah , come on , I beat the house , that means I 'm an Evo ? ( CHUCKLES ) ( CHUCKLES ) I just needed to make some fast dough . Look , I swear this will never happen again . You turn me over and those club goons will kill me . Or worse . Then give me the money and hit the road . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) It 's your only play . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Or not . ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( CHOKING ) ( CHOKING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( COUGHS ) ( GASPS ) ( GASPING ) ( MOLLY PANTING ) WOMAN : Send security to 601 ! A man just attacked a woman ! Are you okay ? MOLLY : Yeah . Let 's go . Who the hell are you ? A good Samaritan . Trust me , you don 't want to be here . My money 's in there . I saw you in the Dragon Lounge , and so I 'm betting the money is his , and you don 't look like someone who wants to deal with oops . Come on . We 'll get a drink . QUENTIN : whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Wait a second , wait a second , wait a second . I didn 't hear anything about toxins . All right , did they discover that the site was contaminated after the cleanup ? Because now this all seems like a terrible idea . I think it 's a scarecrow to keep people out . You think ? Shouldn 't we be certain where deadly toxins are concerned ? Oh , Jesus . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) QUENTIN : Am I turning green ? Am I turning green , man ? Man . It 's so weird to be back in Odessa . Must be way weirder for you . Your old job looking like this . All your memories . Yep . Weird . They would have fixed this up if things were still going on , right ? NOAH : Nope . That 'd be just like ' em . Level five is where things happened . ( NOAH GRUNTS ) ( QUENTIN GRUNTS ) ( QUENTIN GRUNTING ) Oh , no ! ( COUGHS ) Jesus . QUENTIN : What the hell are we looking for ? I 'll tell you when I find it . QUENTIN : Whoa . Who the hell are you , James Bond ? NOAH : See if you can flag anything with Molly Walker or Renautas . This would be the jackpot if they found this . Names , addresses , contacts ... All with powers . You said your daughter died here at the summit . That 's right . You might need to rethink that . I don 't remember this . I remember arriving the morning of June 13th . And after that ... I just knew what the rest of the world knew . And I just assumed Claire had died here like everybody else . And if she didn 't die here , then where did she die ? And how did she die ? And why didn 't you know ? QUENTIN : Are they doing something else with the Evos ? Well , if you can 't tell me , who 's going to tell me ? What ? What ? Why are you so interested in her ? In me ? Huh ? Little twerp like you should be holed up in your mother 's basement trolling conspiracy boards . I was just trying to help . Something terrible 's gonna happen . ( GRUNTS ) My sister . They took my sister and I couldn 't stop them . ( PANTS ) Phoebe Frady . I 'm just trying to find her . Is this about revenge ? Did you think I did it ? Was it you ? Her power was umbrakinesis . She could manipulate darkness . No . She wasn 't one of mine . And I 'm sorry you lost her . I have reason to believe that Phoebe did not die on June 13th with the rest of them . The things that I 've found , they , uh ... They don 't add up . Claire and I had a fight right after she came out . I haven 't spoken to her in over four years . I wanted to make things right . I would have done anything to save her . QUENTIN : Maybe there 's no answer for me here , but I 'd be happy to help you find out what happened to your daughter . It 's the least I can do . We gotta be honest with each other . No more secrets . No more omissions . Deal ? What happens when we 've killed every last one of them ? I don 't know . Hang up our guns ? Why is there no light switch ? Sometimes I think that you hate me , Luke . You 're my wife , Joanne . I don 't hate you . I know I can be a ... A taskmaster . Why is there no light switch ? But I just ... I feel in my bones that what we 're doing is right . And I think that the world is starting to recognize it . You believe that , don 't you ? I don 't know . Listen , Dennis was afraid of the dark . A lot of kids are afraid of the dark . Monsters under the bed , in the closets , so they keep the lights on , but why no light switch at all ? Huh ? What happens if this room goes dark ? Maybe we see something that we 're not supposed to . I know I can be a bloodthirsty cur , but I just can 't bear to half-ass it . Come here . What ? Come here . Stand right there . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( SLURPING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Look , man , I don 't know what you 're thinking ... ( STAMMERS ) But I tried , but ... Dude ! You are the man ! Thank you so much . But ... Wait , what ? You know what this means for us ? It 's like we 're free . Is your stepfather ... Gone , gone , gone . I 'll never mess with you again . I 'll never let anyone mess with you . Your secret 's safe , man , forever . I totally got your back . ( LATINO MUSIC PLAYING ) ( KEYS JANGLE ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Ah ! Officer Pakowski , you lied about what happened in that alley . Who told you to set up El Vengador ? ( GROANS ) Who are you ? Give me a name . You 're crazy ! You don 't know who you 're dealing with ! Give me a name now . He 'll kill me ! ( GROANS ) So will I. ( GRUNTING ) Captain Dearing ! It was Dearing . ( GRUNTS ) For your head . I 'm Taylor . Zoe . Thanks for everything . You 're welcome . Here 's to having a life way more exciting than mine . ( CHUCKLES ) You wouldn 't like it . I 've got a lot of serious people looking for me . The money in his room , that 's all I had . And I needed to disappear . I can write you a check . Seriously ? I have way more money than I need . I know what it feels like to want to disappear . Must be nice , not worrying about money . ( CHUCKLES ) Unless you earn it , money always comes with strings attached . Trust fund baby ? No shame in that . I 'd trade my hustle for it in a heartbeat . I wish I had the balls to live without a safety net like you . Hmm . ( CHURCH BELL TOLLING ) I 'm only on my knees 'cause there 's nowhere to sit . I 'm more concerned with your faith in yourself than your faith in God . Yeah , yeah , yeah , whatever you were trying to tell me at Oscar 's funeral , did it have something to do with this ? Yes . What was Oscar up to ? He had a secret room in the garage . A chart with photos of cops and ... After June 13th , your brother started an underground railroad for evolved humans , to help others like him get to a safe place in Canada . Before Oscar died , he said he was set up . Oscar believed there was a shadow unit inside the police department set up to compromise the railroad . I have a name . Captain James Dearing . Carlos , I have a favor to ask . I have to put two Evos , good people , on a boat to Vancouver . Their journey starts from your brother 's secret room . Tonight . Why do you care so much about them ? My only calling is to minister to the poor , troubled , and persecuted , and ... One more thing . I don 't have a right to be weirded out by you and Brad being bros , but I am . Yeah , me too . He punched me the other day , and now he 's my best friend . The whole thing 's so crazy . I mean , Brad thinks you made his stepdad disappear , but you swear you didn 't . Yeah , on my mother 's eyes . You won 't say anything , right ? Tommy . TOMMY : There 's something else . You can 't tell anyone . I 've been getting these texts from someone who I think is trying to protect me . From what ? I don 't know . But whoever it is they are the reason I didn 't die with Coach Lewis in that church fire . When I touched the flower this morning , I was thinking about the first time I saw you . TOMMY : I ordered maple walnut . That 's it ! Things go to whatever place you 're thinking about when you touch them . Do you remember what you were thinking about when you made those two creeps disappear ? I was , uh , I was afraid I was being kidnapped again , so I was thinking about the place they took me when I was a kid . ( CRASHING ) Observation windows . What kind of demented place is this ? ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) JOANNE : How the hell do we get out of here ? ( BEEPING ) You ... ( BEEPING ) MAN 12 Oh ! LUKE : Joanne , damn it ! ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) ( GROANING ) ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) ( GUNFIRE ) ( GUN COCKS ) Wait in the car . All right . ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Level one . ( ALARM BEEPING ) ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Level five . ( ALARM BEEPING ) ( STEVENS BREATHING HEAVILY ) NOAH : Stevens ! Who did this ? ( GASPING ) A man and a woman . What the hell is going on here ? Figured out a way to monetize the Evos . Monetize them to do what ? Save the world . HOW will they find ... Do they have Molly Walker ? Epic still launches tomorrow . That can 't happen without her . She 's the only one who could locate ... ls she in Midian ? Stevens ? Careful . Watch your step . This is Sylvia and Damon . They had to leave their home in Las Vegas because of her power . This tunnel leads to the harbor . There 's a boat there waiting to take you to Vancouver . SYLVIA : Small token of gratitude . It 's 24 karat . Thank you . Oh , my God . This is all of them . A whole list of all the freaks . Names , addresses . ( LAUGHS ) I don 't believe it . Whose car is this ? Who cares ? What happened ? Where 's my car ? A couple . They shot me , and then they took it . QUENTIN : What went on in there ? Renautas is using powers to create a new technology . They launch a product tomorrow called Epic in Midian . And Molly Walker 's power drives it . You were right . Thanks . I 'll find something to sew you up . Like what ? Like a doctor ? Some surgical equipment ? You 're gonna be fine . We 've got to get to Midian and save Molly . I , uh , I think I got a concussion on top of what she did . TAYLOR : Good Samaritans , what are you gonna do ? You drugged me , you bitch . Who are you ? The trust fund baby that hustled you . We have Molly Walker . ( GRUNTS ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( SIGHS ) ( SIRENS BLARING ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( ALL GRUNTING )

 Previously on Travelers . Our mission was to acquire a component from Russian Travelers and deliver it to another team for testing , but they got greedy . A Traveler team turned on you ? He must be new . We gotta talk about this family . We 're not a family . Mother , father , and son . Did your host have a family ? David . His name is David . Your priorities are all outta whack ! We came here with a team of five . Well , we 're down to two now . Don 't think the future doesn 't get its hands dirty . Dad ? Dad ! Please , stop ! Daddy ! Stop ! Dad ! Stop the car ! You 're scaring me ! Dad ! Stop ! Please ! Dad ! Daddy , stop ! Stop ! Dad , stop ! Dad , stop , please ! Welcome to the 21st . I 'm Traveler 3468 . 3117 . 3890 . 3892 . What 's happening ? Misfire . Shit . Hi . I 'm Grant . What 's your name ? Charlotte . Charlotte , it 's okay . I 'm a policeman . No , really . I ... I am . See ? It says " FBI " . Well , it 's like a policeman . It 's better , even ! Look , my friends and I need to have a ... a talk with your ... your mom and your dad and your brother about what just happened . Why was he doing that ? Why did you do that ? Look , I know you 're upset . I would be , too . Just ... just let us ... let us talk with your family , and everything will be all right . I promise . Sweetie , do you have any other family that live around here ? 10 clicks back down the road . Grandmother , mother 's side . Your side . How about if I take you there ? I want to go with my mom . You go with the nice man , Charlotte . We 'll be back in a few days and we 'll be a family again . Okay , that 's my car over there . The black one . Can you wait there for me ? Car was going pretty fast . Maybe she was moving inside of it ? It 's a tough T.E.L.L. for the Director to calculate . Well , it doesn 't matter , it happened . I 'll deal with her now . Who is your historian ? She was going to be . This isn 't nearly enough to set you up , so put it on " Non-Event Horizon " in the fourth . It 's a horse race . Tomorrow . Look it up . This is the device . Keep it upright . What are you gonna do with her ? I guess I 'll just take her to Grandma 's and explain that Mom and Dad will be back after the mission ... obviously without mentioning the mission , which is in just over 48 hours , and you 're down a team member . - Can you make the adjustment ? - We 'll be ready . Go . We can brief them . Good . Protocol 5 till then . Okay , boss . It 's done . Tip went out as of this morning . I wonder how many misfires there have been since we started this . First wave was upwards of 30 % . Wow ! Nobody told me that . Yeah . Me neither . Would you have still volunteered ? Probably . I mean , if you think about it , what other choice did we ... Carly ... Carly ? Trevor ? I 'm over here . You all right ? My head . Concussion . Can you tell if Marcy 's breathing ? I can 't see her face . Slow and shallow . Philip ? Philip ! What do we know ? Not where we are , not for how long , or who abducted us , but it 's been a couple of hours , at least . My mouth is dry . No eyes or ears on us that I can see . We shouldn 't count on it . They cut out my com . I can 't feel it . Yeah , same . I gotta stop getting whacked on the head . I 'm a blank here . Where 's the boss ? MacLaren was on his way to Grandma 's house . So he wasn 't with us when we were taken . That 's good . There 's a chance he 'll find us before the mission . Well , he 'd better hurry up . Wheelchairs ? Whoever they are , they plan on moving us . Don 't know about that . They 're giving us fluids intravenously . I think we 're gonna be in these chairs a while . And it 's been a Lotta years since I felt this sensation , but ... it 's pretty unmistakable . Catheter . God . - Is that what that is ? - Yes , ma 'am . Do me a favor . Don 't say anything remotely suggestive . It could get very painful over here . Don 't make me laugh . I 'm serious ! It 's like a 17-year-old male 's default setting . Look who showed up to work . Hey . Thought you were driving to Olympia ? I was delayed . Where were you this morning ? Kathryn , she needed me to pick up an antique chair for a client because it wouldn 't fit in her car . Why ? What 'd I miss ? You know , the funny thing about court dates is , when you miss one , you don 't get another one next week . You get it next month or next year . That was this morning . It 's cool , I covered for you again , but you 're the lead on this one , Mac . - I 'm sorry , man . - Don 't apologize to me . You got one angry prosecutor on your hands . Well , hello , sir . Didn 't catch your name on the way in . I was unconscious . I 'm Trevor . So here 's a thing ... I got this geography test tomorrow that I really gotta study for . Capital cities , countries ... Am I gonna be able to do that ? 'Cause it 's pretty likely that my parents are gonna ground me again if I fail . Know what that means ? Having to watch hours of golf on television with Gary ! Don 't do it to me , man . Where are you taking him ? Hey , asshole ! I said , where are you taking him ? Bye ! I know it goes against your instincts ... but don 't waste any more energy trying to get free from your restraints . It 's not gonna happen . Hello ? Marce ? Hey . It 's me . Um , I thought you said you were gonna be coming home early for ... for dinner tonight , and , I couldn 't decide what we were gonna have , so I brought the ingredients for basically two different ... ... dinners , and I was just curious to see what you 'd ... you 'd like to have tonight , so ... Yeah , one of them would be , like , roast chicken with vegetables , and the other one , it 's more of a ... it 's like a pasta thing I do , and , um ... well , now ... now I 'm talking to you as if you 're actually on the phone . I don 't know why I do that . That 's ... Well , that 's weird . So anyway , give me a call , or I will see you when you get back here . Hopefully soon . Okay . I 'm gonna start on the roast chicken ... unless you really want the pasta , in which case call me back . It 's David . And I 'm doing it again . Bye . We 're here , Marcy . How bad is it ? My head and my neck . Probably ... just whiplash from the impact . This is the worst hospital in the world or ... We 've been abducted . I obviously vomited on myself . Anybody clock when ? Probably before we got here . The stink 's not as bad as it was . Sorry . Smells around here aren 't going to improve much . We 've only met one of our captors . He came and wheeled Philip out of here a while ago . Never said a word . That 's all we know . We know they intend to keep us alive for a while at least . They 've got us on I.V.s. How long have I been out ? A few hours longer than us . Now don 't be like that , Mr. Giant ! Pick me . Take me instead of her ! I 'm asking nice here ! Come on ! What ? Am I supposed to answer ? Who have I told what ? I don 't understand . No . I 've never seen him before . No . He 's the father of my child , and he 's a police officer , so if I were you people , I 'd ... I don 't understand the question . I have no idea what you 're talking about . Who am I talking to ? Why don 't you show yourself ? _ Look . I just take care of my son all day . My specialty is mac and cheese . He 's with his father today . Don 't you hurt him ! Don 't you dare hurt him ! If that child is harmed in any way ... I will hunt you down ... whoever you are , whenever you are ... And I will kill you . Hey . Sorry to interrupt . There 's someone here who 'd like to see you . A David Mailer ? Who ? " A mutual friend of Marcy , " he said . Sorry . I can send him away . He gave me the impression that you knew each other . No , no , that 's ... send him in . David Mailer , sir . - Thanks , Beth . - Hi . David Mailer . She just ... said that . So FBI headquarters ? It 's a field office . H-h-did you ... ? The address was on the ... the card that you gave me . I gave you ? Yeah , well , you slipped it under my door when I was out a while back . We spoke on the phone later that night . You don 't remember . - No . - How do I know this Marcy person ? Well , I kinda know that she works with you , so , um ... Well , obviously , I can neither confirm nor deny that . Which is cool , and I totally get that , and I know that what you 're doing is very important , and ... she really hasn 't mentioned me ? The point of this visit is ? Marcy didn 't come home last night . Not " home " home . She 's just ... she 's staying with me platonically , but I was expecting her for dinner . W-When did you last see her ? Yesterday morning , when she left . I 'm sure she 's on some sort of secret FBI medical thing , but I was worried and I just wanted to hear from you that ... Okay . Um , I 'm gonna look into this . Why don 't you leave your number with Beth , and I 'll give you a call if I find anything . Wait . You don 't know where she is either ? Beth ? Beth , can you please take Mr. Mailer 's contact information ? Thank you . Marcy , it 's MacLaren . Carly ? Trevor ? Philip ? Shit . Now exhale . Feel the silence between your breaths . Your heart beating in your chest . Constant as the reactor beneath . Giving light . Heat . Time . Philip ! Thank God ! I thought I was alone . I 'm really gonna take it personally if you don 't pick me next time . Hey . Did you see Carly ? They just left with her . I woke up in an empty room and they brought me here . I don 't even know how long I was there . Hours ? Wait . Are you hurt ? Thanks to John Hentrick , no . Inventor of airbags , 1952 . But I am hurting in other ways . Withdrawal . I haven 't been able to go more than 18 hours between doses since we got here , and I can pretty much tell you , without looking at a clock , we 're coming up on that number . Not the rehab facility I thought that I 'd end up in . Marcy and I were meditating . You should , too . There 's no way ... Trust me , Philip . It 'll help . I promise . Now exhale . You 're the one who told me to take the red flag off these same four people . Well , now there 's no sign of any sign of them . One of them might be missing . Just do it , please . I 'll put in the request , but even a priority facial recognition search isn 't likely to turn up anything . Let 's try to be a little more positive , shall we ? Okay , sure , I 'm positive that I 'm the one they 're gonna complain to for using up NSA mainframe time on something you called a false alarm . Jesus ! David . What are you doing out here ? Just waiting to hear if you 've got anything yet . Well , in the 11 minutes since you left my office ? No . I have employed resources . Like ? If Marcy 's face shows up practically anywhere there 's a closed-circuit TV camera , we 'll know her location . Great . Tell me how I can help . You can go home . My God . You 're just like her . Would you stop ? You know what ? I 'm gonna help you out , whether you like it or not . How about that ? What 're you gonna do , follow me on your bike ? Hah ! She did tell you about me . You just gave it all away . You know I have a bike . Your right pant leg is tucked into your sock . I was giving you the benefit of the doubt . Okay , I get it . I 'm not qualified , but just know this ... Marcy 's welfare is very important to me . When I find her , I 'll call you . Or better still ... she 'll just come home . Okay , so if I don 't hear from you by what , like , 5 : 00 ... I 'm getting the feeling we 're not gonna make our next mission . That is the least of my problems right now . Come on , Philip . You 're stronger than that . You have no idea what this feels like , so why don 't you ... I can 't see . I can 't see ! Really ? You 're gonna pass over me again ? How many of them are there ? What did they do ? Just the one you 've already met . There was an old-style television in an open space , like a warehouse . In this building ? Must be . Then they asked questions . Just words on the television . " When are you from ? " Shit . They know . No . There 's nothing to know . Well , they obviously know something . They have Jeffrey . - What ? - My son . They showed him to me on the television . They have him . I saw . Wha ... Whoa , whoa . Guys ? What 's he doing ? He 's injecting something into your I.V. line . Whoa-whoa-whoa ! What ... I ... Never mind . No . No-no-no ! Stop , stop . That 's too much . No ! Stop ! He 'll overdose ! Stop ! That 's okay . It 's what I needed . That amount of heroin will slow your respiration rate and your heart rate down to dangerous levels . Philip ? You need to stay with us , okay ? - I 'm here . - Philip , stay awake . Philip ! Listen to Marcy ! I can hear you , I 'm ... Philip . No . No , no ! No ! No ! No ! Philip ! Carly ! Make sure he stays awake ! Philip , you stay awake , okay ? Hello ? My name is Marcy Warton . I work at a library . I don 't know why you 've taken me here . I haven 't done anything wrong . Hello ? Marcy ! Yes . Thank God . I was so worried . I 've been freaking out . No . No , I get it . Yeah . Mum 's the word . Yeah , no , of course , you 're ... you 're busy . Okay . Well , when you do , I 'll be here . Yeah , all right , yeah . We 'll have the chicken . Yeah , chicken sounds good . I can 't wait . Okay . Yeah . Bye-bye . Philip ! Philip , you do not have permission to sleep ! We asked you a question ! I 'm still here . Good . That 's good . Talk to us . Tell us about your parents . Where do they live ? Yeah . You never talk about them . What 's your mother 's name ? 2144 . Stay in the here and now , Philip ... Do you remember the taste of the water ? Recycled so many times it could never be made pure again ? Shut up ! This can 't be heroin . No , no , no , it is . Or at least the first one was , and I am more grateful for it than I care to admit , but the second one was something else . Something I think would only work on someone who 's been modified to be an historian . What is it ? Memory ... pouring in like a flood . Like the Helios tidal wave . I can 't stop it . I 'm drowning in it ! I want you to breathe deeply - and listen to my voice ... - You can 't compete with this . Do you remember the taste of metal in the air ? The stink of 20,000 souls crammed into a shelter designed for half that number ? Don 't talk about the past ! You mean the future . I mean stop talking . Do you guys remember when the reveille bell rang at the exact moment the dome in shelter 41 collapsed ? It was exactly at 0600 ... almost like cause and effect . The bell rang and woke everyone up a split second before they died . As a boy , I remember thinking , " That 's so unfair . " Philip , keep your mouth shut . I 'm not sure that I can . Philip ... Philip ! I 'll try . Philip . Philip ? I 'll try . I 'll try . I 'll try , I 'll try . Philip ! I 'll try , I 'll try ... Philip ? Philip ! Philip ? Philip ? Where are you guys ? " No battle plan survives contact ... " " Plans are useless . " " ... You are planning to fail . " - " ... Planning is indispensable . " - ... Franklin . Franklin ... " If you fail to plan , you are planning to fail . " Benjamin Franklin . " No battle plan ... " Battle plan ... " ... survives contact with the enemy . " Helmuth Von Moltke . " My mission ... " " ... in life is not merely to survive , but to thrive ... " To thrive . " And to do so with some passion ... " passion , some compassion , some humor , and some style ! " Maya Angelou !

" " This is the way the world ends ... " " ... Not with a bang ... " " ... but a whimper . " ... Eliot ! * * * Well , it 's a start . What about 911 records ? E.M.T. calls ? Nothing . I 've also tried virtually every emergency room in the Pacific Northwest . You sure you don 't want me to call Agent Forbes ? No , he 's got enough on his plate . Well , it 's just that he asked me to keep him updated on everything . I said that I was sure , Beth . How many freaking times do you need me to say it ? Sorry . I 'm having a bad day . Well , now we all are . Just let me know if you find anything . Okay . Ho , ho ! Come on ! Finally ! I 've really been looking forward to this , Mr. Giant . Thank you so-o-o much . Ha-hah ! I just hate being the last guy picked , you know ? Drives me crazy . I 'm sure a guy like you understands . Back soon ! All right , all right ! Hey-hey . Freight elevator . Sweet ride . Hey , are we going up or down ? I 'm gonna guess down . Up ! You son of a bitch ! You got me ! Can I help you ? Special Agent Grant MacLaren . I 'm with the FBI . I 'm looking for a silver van that was brought here yesterday , about 3 : 30 in the afternoon . The one that got T-boned by the Peterbilt ? T-boned by the Pe ... ? Yeah . Sure . Show me . Hey , FBI doing traffic accidents now ? No . Well , what 's this about ? It 's about you showing me the van , and not asking me anymore goddamn questions . 'Kay . There she is . Total write-off . Do you know if any of the occupants were badly hurt ? We don 't get reports on the incidents . The airbags went off , I can tell you that . Okay . Thanks for your time . You wanna dust it for prints or hit it with a little blue light or nothin ' ? Knock yourself out . Wow ! This is great up here . Nice big space , daylight . That 's a big old CRT . I 'm guessing ... late ' 90s . Those flat-screen sons of guns are heavy ? Probably not so much for you . I bet you didn 't even need help from your friends . You do have friends , right ? Are they government , or is this a private contractor gig ? Whoa , a question on the TV ! I love it . It 's like that show my mom watches after supper . You know , most people would ask " Where are you from ? " But hey , I don 't want to offend anybody , if English is a second language . Maybe it 's a typo ? What a coincidence ! I was gonna ask you the same thing , since you 're the ones who brought me here , but hey , like my humanities teacher , Mr. Warchowski , says ... " Why are we all here ? " Right ? Guess . 'Kay , technically , I 'll be 18 in October , but I 'm kind of an old soul . What about you , Mr. Giant ? When 's your birthday ? Back when I was starting quarterback , our mission was to win the division , obviously . You look like you played a little ball in your day , Mr. Giant . Then again ... a deaf-mute like yourself wouldn 't be able to hear the quarterback call plays , would he ? Ho-ho ! I 'll catch you later , man ! What did you say to them ? I got ' em right where I want ' em . Excuse me . Officer Boyd ? You got a second ? Sure . Excuse me . What about the ... The CCTV is down . What the hell are you doing here ? I thought I made it very clear last time that you were not to communicate with me . Yeah , well , screw Protocol 6 . My team is missing . For how long ? Since yesterday morning . Apparently . I just found out about it a while ago . All of them ! Their coms and locators are offline . They don 't show up on GPS . What about the deep web backchannel ? That 's the first place I looked ! There 's no sign of them . It 's like they 've disappeared . The FBI has far more resources than I do . I 'm running a facial recognition search through the NSA . Which could take forever , if it works at all . I know ! But what else can I do ? They 've all been previously red-flagged ... by the previous me . I found their vehicle in ... in a salvage yard . It had been T-boned by a Vanderbilt ... or some damn thing . Trail ends there , I 'm guessing ? Okay , you need to consider the possibility that they 've been taken out of the equation . What equation ? The Director 's . I 've seen entire teams I was supposed to work on a mission with just disappear into thin air . Probably taken out by another traveler team under orders . You know as well as I do , the future has the ultimate power over us . If the Director doesn 't like the way we perform , a decision we make ... W-W-Why them ? I 'm responsible for my team 's actions . Well , how badly have you messed up lately ? Maybe you 're next . I don 't buy that . What do you want from me ? My team has been tasked to participate in a mission that requires six people , minimum , to pull it off . - When ? - Tonight . And that 's what you 're here about ? You want my team 's help ? The mission comes first . The mission 's canceled , MacLaren ! You just don 't get it yet . Thanks for your help . Hold on . If you get a real lead , I will help you go after them . Okay ? I 'll help you . But if I 'm right , and it 's the Director ... I know . I hope I 'm wrong . Torture doesn 't work , people . It 's been proven ! You know , whoever you are , whatever information you think you 're getting is of almost no value . Philip . His name is Philip . He was in the van with me when we were ... I don 't understand the question . I mean , if you 're asking how old ... No ! No ! Where 's the rest of your team ? We have to cancel the mission . What about all those people ? I was hoping the Director would send you a replacement team , but ... Maybe there 's still a way . No , no . Forget it , the mission 's canceled . The Director will have an alternative . We have to trust that . I 'm sorry about your team . I haven 't given up just yet . There 's no way they can do the mission with so few personnel . All those people are gonna die . They already did . We just weren 't there to prevent it from happening . Just hope the boss isn 't in the same situation as we are somewhere . I have an idea that could end this , if the opportunity presents itself again . But I want everyone to decide . We may not be better off . I say go for it . How ? You 're gonna try to talk me out of it . Why ? It 's insane . Marcy ! Philip ? You 're alive ? I saw ... I saw you die , they showed me . - No , I 'm right here . - No , on the television . They ... They shot you in the chest . No , no , no , no , Marcy , Marcy , he 's right in front of you . Marcy , look at me . You were in those clothes , you were slumped over ... This is good . What ? How ? Think about it ! They probably don 't even have Carly 's kid ! They 're just pushing buttons and seeing what happens . I don 't know who , but this still gives us power we don 't have much of . We don 't have any power . Please ? Please ... Before you take him away , would you ... ? Hang on ! Jesus Christ ! He 's alive . He 's cold . Dead for hours . I 've gotta get ' em out of here . Look for a key ! Check his pockets ! - I got it ! I got it ! - Got it ? Carly ! Carly . She 's unconscious , but strong pulse , though . It 's me . I 'm here . You 're late . Won 't happen again . Gonna get you outta here , okay ? How many days ? Three . I had to end it . What ... What was this about ? Why did he do it ? It wasn 't him . He was a hired gun . We never found out who it was . I 'm gonna get you out of this . Wait . What about the mission ? No , it 's canceled . Couldn 't do it without you . There was no way . What ? What is it ? What if that 's what this was about ?

 ( Music playing ) ( Panting ) ( Beeping ) - Mama ! - Lyra : We know . gather your things . It 's time . it 's lyra . It 's happened . He 's come for us . You know what to do . ( Loud humming ) come here . I do it to protect you . Say you understand . I understand . stardust . papa . Galen . Go . Jyn . don 't you ? Trust the force . ( Sighs ) ( Panting ) galen . But farming ... Really ? Man of your talents ? It 's a peaceful life . I imagine . yes . Oh . ( Exhales ) My condolences . Search the house . ( Mechanical voices speaking indistinctly ) Galen : What is it you want ? The work has stalled . I need you to come back . krennic . We were on the verge of greatness . We were this close to providing peace and security for the galaxy . You 're confusing peace with terror . you have to start somewhere . ( Indistinct chatter ) krennic . My mind just isn 't what it was . I have trouble remembering . Even simple things . Galen ... but you 're a terrible liar . I admire the effort . I really do . back from the dead . It 's a miracle . ( Speaks indistinctly ) Stop ! ( Weapon whines ) troublesome as ever . You 're not taking him . of course I 'm not . I 'm taking you all . your child . You 'll all live in comfort . As hostages . As heroes of the empire . Lyra . Put it down . Think very carefully . ( Breath trembling ) - You will never win . - Do it . - ( Weapons firing ) - ( Both groaning ) - ( Gasps ) - Lyra ! Lyra ! They have a child ! Find it ! ( Jyn panting ) ( Door opens ) ( Mechanical voices speaking ) ( Jyn breathing heavily ) ( Thunder rumbling ) ( Jyn continues panting ) ( Footsteps approaching ) My child ! Come . Come . We have a long ride ahead of us . ( Theme music playing ) ( Water dripping ) ( Door opens ) ( Cell mate snoring ) cell block 4227 . 4227 . ( Man screaming in pain ) ( Indistinct chatter ) ( Speaking alien language ) xx-25900 . ( Indistinct chatter continues ) ( Tivik panting ) I was about to leave . I came as fast as I could . I have to get back on board . Walk with me . Back to jedha ? They 'll leave without me . Easy ! You have news from jedha . Come on . one of the cargo drivers he defected yesterday . He 's telling people they 're making a weapon . that 's what they 're for . What kind of weapon ? I have to go . - What kind of weapon ? A planet killer ! That 's what he called it ! A planet killer ? Someone named erso sent him . Some old friend of saw 's . Galen erso ? Was it ? I don 't know ! They were looking for saw when we left . - Who else knows about this ? - I have no idea . It 's all falling apart . Saw 's right . - There 's spies everywhere . - ( Indistinct radio chatter ) Stormtrooper 1 : What 's all this ? let 's see some scandocs . of course . Just ... my gloves . ( Groans ) - No ! - ( Indistinct yelling ) What have you done ? Troopers down . Section 9 . Tivik : Are you crazy ? I 'll never climb out of here . My arm ! Stormtrooper 2 : Get out of the way . Move ! Move ! Hey . Calm down . Calm down . - It will be all right . - ( Breathing heavily ) ( Fires weapon ) ( Alarm blaring in the distance ) ( Grunting ) ( Speaking alien language ) Is that him ? He looks kind of different to how I imagined . ( Speaking alien language ) ( Gasps ) Okay . So you 're saw gerrera ? Saw gerrera ? No ? we 're just wasting time that we don 't have . I need to speak to saw gerrera . I keep telling them . Before it 's too late . ( Speaking alien language ) We 're out here in the middle of nowhere . We need to get to jedha city . What part of " urgent message " do you guys not understand ? ( Grunting ) We are all on the same side . If you just see past the uniform for a minute . ( Continues speaking indistinctly ) ( Vehicle stops ) What now ? I don 't know . Must be another pickup . I thought we had everybody . ( Door latch clicks ) ( Stormtroopers groaning ) sir . Hallik ! Liana hallik ! Her . You wanna get out of here ? Hey ! What about me ? ( Grunting ) Give me the keys ! Give me the keys ! ( Continues grunting ) ( Groans ) Congratulations . You are being rescued . Please do not resist . ( Rebel soldiers speaking indistinctly ) report to maintenance level 4 . ( Indistinct mechanical chatter ) You 're currently calling yourself Liana hallik . Is that correct ? Possession of unsanctioned weapons . Forgery of imperial documents . Aggravated assault . Escape from custody . Resisting arrest . Imagine if the imperial authorities had found out ... jyn erso . is it not ? daughter of galen erso ? A known imperial collaborator in weapons development . What is this ? Mon mothma : It 's a chance for you to make a fresh start . We think you might be able to help us . rebel intelligence . When was the last time you were in contact with your father ? 15 years ago . Any idea where he 's been all that time ? I like to think he 's dead . Makes things easier . Easier than what ? That he 's been a tool of the imperial war machine ? I 've never had the luxury of political opinions . Really ? When was your last contact with saw gerrera ? It 's been a long time . though . Wouldn 't he ? if you came as a friend . we 'll just put you back where we found you . I was a child . Saw gerrera saved my life . He raised me . But I have no idea where he is . I haven 't seen him in years . Cassian : We know how to find him . That 's not our problem . What we need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed . aren 't you ? but saw gerrera is an extremist . He 's been fighting on his own since he broke with the rebellion . His militancy has caused the alliance a great many problems . We have no choice now but to try and mend that broken trust . What does this have to do with my father ? There 's an imperial defector in jedha . A pilot . He 's been held by saw gerrera . He 's claiming the emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets . The pilot says he was sent by your father . Mon mothma : We need to stop this weapon before it is finished . Captain andor 's mission is to authenticate the pilot 's story . find your father . It appears he is critical to the development of this super weapon . Given the gravity of the situation we 're hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the senate for testimony . And if I do it ? We 'll make sure you go free . ( Rebel soldiers speaking indistinctly ) Draven : Captain andor . ( Indistinct announcement over pa ) I 'm k-2so . I 'm a reprogrammed imperial droid . I remember you . I see the council is sending you with us to jedha . Apparently so . and so does cassian . What do I know ? My specialty is just - strategic analysis . - ( Keyboard clacking ) Galen erso is vital to the empire 's weapons program . Forget what you heard in there . There will be no extraction . You find him ... You kill him . Then and there . Male dispatcher : ( Over radio ) Shuttle number lmtr-20 . Prepare for takeoff while we check your authorization . Cassian : You met k-2 ? Charming . He tends to say whatever comes into his circuits . It 's a byproduct of the reprogram . Why does she get a blaster and I don 't ? - What ? - I know how to use it . That 's what I 'm afraid of . Give it to me . We 're going to jedha . That 's a war zone . That 's not the point . Where 'd you get it ? I found it . K-2so : I find that answer vague and unconvincing . Trust goes both ways . You 're letting her keep it ? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you ? It 's high . Let 's get going . It 's very high . - ( Buttons clicking ) - ( Dramatic music playing ) Saw : ( Shouting ) Lies ! Deceptions ! Let 's see it . Bodhi rook . Cargo pilot . huh ? - Uh-huh . ( Speaking alien language ) Bodhi : ( Chuckles ) Okay . I can hear you . He didn 't capture me . I came here myself . I defected . I defected . more lies . ( Grunts ) Lies ? Would I risk everything for a lie ? we don 't have time for this . I have to speak to saw gerrera before it 's too late . ( Exhales ) Okay . you 're ... Um ... ( Stammers ) That 's for you . And I gave it to them . They did not find it ! I gave it to them . galen erso . He told me to find you . ( Inhales deeply ) ( Grunts ) Bor gullet . bor gullet ? What ? Wait ! ( Grunting ) Galen erso sent me ! He told me to find you . ( Dramatic music playing ) Tarkin : Most unfortunate about director krennic . and now this . ( Sighs ) We 've heard word of rumors circulating through the city . you 've lost a rather talkative cargo pilot . countless systems will flock to the rebellion . governor tarkin ... The senate will be of little concern . director krennic . The emperor will tolerate no further delay . You have made time an ally of the rebellion . I suggest we solve both problems simultaneously ... With an immediate test of the weapon . Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience . I will not fail . ( Thrilling music playing ) jyn ? You look frightened . I 'll always protect you . Stardust . Don 't ever change . Lyra : Trust . Galen . - ( Door opens ) - ( Gasps ) Cassian : We 're coming into orbit . You have controls . That 's jedha . Or what 's left of it . we find your father . ( Dramatic music playing ) What 's with the destroyer ? saw gerrera . He 's been attacking the cargo shipments . What are they bringing in ? It 's what are they taking out . Kyber crystal . All they can get . We wondered why they were stripping the temple . Now we know . It 's the fuel for the weapon . The weapon your father 's building . Maybe we should leave target practice behind . Are you talking about me ? She 's right . We need to blend in . Stay with the ship . I can blend in . I 'm an imperial droid . The city is under imperial occupation . Half the people here wanna reprogram you . The other half wanna put a hole in your head . I 'm surprised you 're so concerned with my safety . I 'm not . I 'm just worried they might miss you and hit me . Doesn 't sound so bad to me . - ( Bor gullet grunting ) - ( Bodhi breathing heavily ) Saw : Bor gullet can feel your thoughts . No lie is safe . whimpering ) cargo pilot ? Bor gullet will know the truth . The unfortunate side effect is that one tends ... To lose one 's mind . No ! ( Whimpering ) ( Somber music playing ) ( Indistinct chatter in alien language ) - ( Jyn grunts ) - Hey . You just watch yourself . no . sir . We don 't want any trouble . Sorry . Come on . Come on . Male imperial officer : Citizens of jedha . You must come forward with information of the location of this missing cargo pilot . A reward of 600 credits for the information shall be awarded . Cassian : I had a contact . One of saw 's rebels . But he 's just gone missing . H is sister will be looking for him . but she 'll be there waiting . We 'll give her your name and hope that gets us a meeting with saw . Hope ? Yeah . Rebellions are built on hope . Stormtrooper 3 : Hands where I can see them . Get over there . Show me some identification . Check inside . ( Indistinct yelling ) Is this all because of your pilot ? Chirrut : May the force of others be with you . Wait for me . Chirrut : May the force of others be with you . May the force of others be with you . Would you trade that necklace for a glimpse into your future ? Yes . I 'm speaking to you . I 'm chirrut îmwe . How did you know i was wearing a necklace ? you must pay . What do you know about kyber crystals ? he ... He said they powered the jedi 's lightsabers . Jyn . Come on . Let 's go . The strongest stars have hearts of kyber . Let 's go . We 're not here to make friends . ( Speaking alien language ) Who are they ? The guardians of the whills . Protectors of the kyber temple . But there 's nothing left to protect . So now they 're just causing trouble for everybody . You seem awfully tense all of a sudden . We have to hurry . This town is ready to blow . Male imperial announcer : Citizens of the empire ... Imperial forces tirelessly fight saw gerrera 's reign of terror ... Over the people of this beloved city . Truth and justice are the tools of the empire . ( Announcement continues indistinctly ) ( Speaks alien language ) ( Speaking alien language ) Tell me you have a backup plan . - ( Gunfire ) - ( All screaming ) Incoming ! - ( Gun fire ) - ( Indistinct shouting ) Looks like we found saw 's rebels . Up there ! ( Child wailing ) no ! ( Woman shouts ) Hit the terrorist . Get out of there ! ( Shouts ) ( Man screams ) ( Shouting in alien language ) Kyber ... ( Speaks alien language ) Come on ! ( Gunfire and shouting continue ) This way ! Cassian ! ( baton clicking ) ( Jyn grunting ) ( Stormtrooper groans ) Did you know that wasn 't me ? Yeah . Of course . I thought I told you to stay on the ship . and you were in trouble . There were a lot of explosions ... - For two people blending in . - Stormtrooper : Freeze ! You 're right . I should just wait on the ship . ( Indistinct chatter ) Stormtrooper : Halt . Stop right there . Where are you taking these prisoners ? - These are prisoners . - Yes . Where are you taking them ? I am taking them to imprison them in prison . - He 's taking us to ... ( Groans ) - Quiet ! And there 's a fresh one if you mouth off again . - We 'll take them from here . - That 's okay . I 'm sure . wait a second . - Take them away . - Wait . You can 't take them away . You . Stay here . We need to check your diagnostics . Diagnostics ? thank you very much . Chirrut : Let them pass in peace . Let them pass in peace . The force is with me . And I am with the force . And I fear nothing . For all is as the force wills it . stop right there . He 's blind . Is he deaf ? I said stop right there ! ( Weapons cocking ) ( Stormtroopers groaning ) Is your foot all right ? ( Groaning continues ) ( Jyn gasps ) You almost shot me . You 're welcome . Clear of hostiles . - One hostile . - He 's with us . They 're all right . Thanks . I 'm sorry about the slap . Go back to the ship . Wait for my call . Is he a jedi ? There are no jedi here anymore . Only dreamers like this fool . The force did protect me . I protected you . Can you get us to saw gerrera ? ( Shouting in alien language ) Can 't you see ? We are no friends of the empire . ( Speaking alien language ) Anyone who kills me or my friends will answer to saw gerrera . Because I 'm the daughter of galen erso . ( Grunting ) Are you kidding me ? I 'm blind . ( Indistinct chatter ) - ( Shouting ) - ( Groans ) ( Music and alien chatter ) the force is with me . the force is with me . You pray ? the force is with me . Really ? the force is with me . He 's praying for the door to open . It bothers him because he knows it 's possible . ( Snickering ) Baze malbus was once the most devoted guardian of us all . I 'm beginning to think the force and i have different priorities . captain . We 've been in worse cages than this one . This is the first for me . captain . I sense that you carry yours wherever you go . ( Baze scoffs ) ( Indistinct chatter ) ( Speaking alien language ) Saw : Jyn . Is it really you ? I can 't believe it ! Must be quite a surprise . Are we not still friends ? you gave me a knife and loaded blaster ... And told me to wait in a bunker till daylight . I knew you were safe . You left me behind . You were already the best soldier in my cadre . - I was 16 ! - I was protecting you ! You dumped me ! You were the daughter of an imperial science officer . People were starting to figure that out . People who wanted to use you as a hostage . Not a day goes by ... That I don 't think of you . But today ... Of all days ... ( Breath trembling ) It 's a trap . Isn 't it ? ( Laughs ) What ? The pilot . The message . All of it . ( Breathes deeply ) Did they send you ? Did you come here ... To kill me ? There 's not much of me left . The alliance wants my father . They think he sent you a message about a weapon . you might actually help them out . jyn ? they 've got it . I 'm out now . Rest of you can do what you want . You care not about the cause ? The cause ? Seriously ? The alliance ... whatever it is you 're calling yourself these days ... All it 's ever brought me is pain . You can stand to see the imperial flag reign across the galaxy ? It 's not a problem if you don 't look up . I have something to show you . Come . ( Dramatic music playing ) The emperor is awaiting my report . One would hope that he and lord vader might 've been here for such an occasion . And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment . Your concern 's hardly warranted . If saying it would only make it so . All imperial forces have been evacuated ... And I stand ready to destroy the entire moon . That won 't be necessary . not a manifesto . The holy city will be enough for today . Target jedha city . Prepare single reactor ignition . ( Mechanical whirring ) we 're in position ... - Fire ! Commence primary ignition . Who 's the one in the next cell ? Baze : What ? Where ? An imperial pilot . - Pilot ? - Baze : I 'm gonna kill him ! wait ! - Come here ! No ! Back off ! Back off ! okay . - Are you the pilot ? - ( Groaning softly ) Hey . Hey . Are you the pilot ? The shuttle pilot ? Pilot ? What 's wrong with him ? Galen erso . You know that name ? I brought the message . I 'm the pilot . ( Chuckles slowly ) I 'm the pilot . I 'm the pilot . Okay . Good . Now where is galen erso ? Announcer : ( Over pa ) Stand by . Saw : This is the message I was sent . if you are watching this ... Then perhaps there 's a chance to save the alliance . Perhaps there 's a chance to explain myself ... though I don 't dare hope for too much ... if she 's alive ... If you can possibly find her ... To let her know that my love for her has never faded ... And how desperately I 've missed her . ( Beeps ) my stardust ... I can 't imagine what you think of me . i faced some bitter truths . I was told that soon enough . Krennic would have you as well . As time went by ... I knew that you were either dead ... Or so well hidden that he would never find you . if I took my own life ... It would only be a matter of time before krennic realized ... He no longer needed me to complete the project . So I did the one thing nobody expected . I lied . I learned to lie . I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work . I made myself indispensable ... I laid the groundwork of my revenge . We call it the death star . There is no better name ... And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed . I 've placed a weakness deep within the system ... they will never find it . jyn ... my beloved ... So much of my life has been wasted . I try to think of you only in the moments when I 'm strong ... Because the pain of not having you with me ... our family . The pain of that loss is so overwhelming ... I risk failing even now . It 's just so hard not to think of you . Think of where you are ... My stardust . Saw ... that 's the key . That 's the place I 've laid my trap . It 's well hidden and unstable . One blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station . You 'll need the plans ... to find the reactor . I know there 's a complete engineering archive ... In the data vault at the citadel tower on scarif . Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module ... Will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station . ( Rumbling ) ( Speaking in alien language ) ( Rumbling continues ) go ! ( Shouting in alien language ) k-2 ! Where are you ? K-2so : There you are . I 'm standing by as you requested ... Although there 's a problem on the horizon . There 's no horizon . now ! Where are you going ? I gotta find jyn . we need him ! All right . I 'll get the pilot . Pilot . no ! Let 's go . Jyn ! Jyn ! Hey . We gotta go . I know where your father is . jyn . You must go ! Come with us . I will run no longer . - Come on . - But you must save yourself . - Come on . - Go ! There 's no time ! Saw : Save the rebellion ! Save the dream . ( Rumbling continues ) ( Shouting in alien language ) it 's beautiful . ( Rumbling continues ) let 's go ! Come on ! Let 's get out of here ! ( Engines roaring ) Cassian : Get us out of here ! Punch it ! I 'm not very optimistic about our odds . k . ( Engines roaring ) ( Thrilling music playing ) ( Decompression hiss ) ( Rumbling ) Come on ! Punch it . I haven 't completed my calculations . I 'll make them for you . ( Indistinct conversations ) director krennic . Your work exceeds all expectations . And you 'll tell the emperor as much ? I will tell him that his Patience with your misadventures ... Has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the rebellion . And that that was only an inkling of its destructive potential . I will tell him that I will be taking control over the weapon ... I first spoke of years ago effective immediately . ( Scoffs ) We stand here amidst my achievement . Not yours ! I 'm afraid the recent security breaches ... Have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director . The breaches have been filled . Jedha has been silenced . You think this pilot acted alone ? He was dispatched from the installation on eadu ... Galen erso 's facility . we 'll see about this . sir . Weapon confirmed . Jedha destroyed . please advise . Destroyed ? Proceed . Tell him my orders still stand . Tell him to proceed with haste ... And keep to the plan . We have no idea what he 's building for the empire . We have to kill galen erso while we have the chance . - ( Whooshing ) - ( Indistinct radio chatter ) tell me . All of it ? The whole city ? Tell me . All of it . Cassian : Understood . ( Radio controls beep ) Set course for eadu . Setting course for eadu . Is that where my father is ? I think so . So you 're galen 's daughter ? You know him ? the pilot . You brought the message . Yes . Your father ... He said I could get right by myself . He said I could make it right ... If I was brave enough ... To listen to what was in my heart . Do something about it . Guess it was too late . It wasn 't too late . Seems pretty late to me . Jyn : No . We can beat the people who did this . I 've seen it . They call it the death star . But they have no idea ... There 's a way to defeat it . You 're wrong about my father . He did build it . Because he knew they 'd do it without him . My father made a choice . He sacrificed himself for the rebellion . He 's rigged a trap inside it . to bring that message . Where is it ? Where 's the message ? It was a hologram . right ? Everything happened so fast . Did you see it ? You don 't believe me ? I 'm not the one you 've got to convince . I believe her . That 's good to know . What kind of trap ? You said your father made a trap . The reactor . He 's placed a weakness there . He 's been hiding it for years . the whole system goes down . You need to send word to the alliance . I 've done that . They have to know there 's a way to destroy this thing . They have to go to scarif to get the plans . I can 't risk sending that . We 're in the heart of imperial territory . Then we 'll find him and bring him back . And he can tell them himself . ( Music playing ) sir . the force is with me . K-2so : 20 degrees to the right . 10 degrees up . lower . Lower ! Are you sure this is the way ? Bodhi : They have landing trackers here . They have patrol squadrons . You 've got to stay in the canyon . Keep it low . ( Warning systems blaring ) Watch your right ! There 's a 26 % chance of failure . How much farther ? I 'm not sure . I never really come this way . we 're close . I know that . there 's a 35 % chance of failure . Cassian : I don 't wanna know . Thank you ! I understand . now ! The wind . you 'll be right over the shuttle depot . - Watch out ! - Cassian : K ! ( Grunting ) Hold on tight ! We 're coming down hard ! ( Alarms blaring ) ( Engines roaring ) Try them again . sir . We ... The signal 's gone dead . Draven : Squadron up . Target eadu . ( Thunder rumbling ) How about now ? Check stabilizers . where 's the lab ? The research facility ? Yeah . Where is it ? It 's just over that Ridge . That 's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us . - You are sure of that ? - Yes . We 'll have to hope there 's still an imperial ship left to steal . Here 's what we 're doing . Hopefully the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here . you 're coming with me . We 'll go up the Ridge and check it out . I 'm coming with you . your father 's message . We can 't risk it . You 're the messenger . we all got the message . Everyone here knows it . ( Gun clicks ) One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down . " the whole system goes down . Get to work fixing our Comms . All I want to do right now is get a handle on what we 're up against . So we 're gonna go very small and very careful up the rise ... And see what 's what . Let 's get outta here . ( Thrilling music playing ) Does he look like a killer ? No . He has the face of a friend . Who are you talking about ? Captain andor . Why 'd you ask that ? " does he look like a killer ? The force moves darkly near a creature that 's about to kill . His weapon was in the sniper configuration . ( Indistinct announcement echoing ) no . We 've got to go up . You can 't see much from down there . ( Thrilling music playing ) ( Indistinct chatter ) ( Indistinct announcement continues ) ( Breathing heavily ) ( Grunts ) This way . I 'll be right behind you . Come on . Where are you going ? I 'm gonna follow jyn . Her path is clear . Alone ? Good luck ! I don 't need luck . I have you ! ( Groans ) What are they doing ? we 're leaving without them . ( Breathing heavily ) ( Thunder rumbles ) You see erso out there ? Baze : We 've come too far . ( Groans ) my friend . ( Panting ) That 's him . in the dark suit . Get back down there and find us a ride outta here . what are you doing ? - You heard me . You said we came up here just to have a look . I 'm looking . Go . Hurry ! ( Dramatic music playing ) galen . The battle station is complete . You must be very proud . krennic . Gather your engineers . I have an announcement . ( Panting ) ( Indistinct conversation ) Is that all of them ? Yes . one of you ... Betrayed the empire . ( Men gasping and exclaiming ) One of you has conspired with a pilot ... To send messages to the rebellion . And I urge that traitor ... Step forward . ( Indistinct conversations continue ) ( Mechanical voice speaks ) Very well ... I 'll consider it a group effort then . Ready ! - No ! No ! - Aim ! And fire ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! stop ! It was me ! They have nothing to do with it . Spare them . ( Breathing heavily ) Fire ! ( Men groaning ) ( Groans ) How do I know the weapon is complete ? Let me share with you some details . ( Stormtrooper screams ) K-2so : Cassian . can you hear me ? Cassian : I 'm here . You 've got it working ? yes . Although we have a problem . There 's an alliance squadron approaching . Clear the area . no ! Tell them to hold off ! Jyn 's on that platform . Jedha ... Saw gerrera . His band of fanatics ... Their holy city ... gone . You 'll never win . Now where have I heard that before ? K-2so : Relay from captain andor . General . Captain andor requesting a delay on squadron support . Alliance forces on site . Please confirm . Get the squadron leader on . Get him on now ! sir . ( Alarm blaring ) ( Dramatic music playing ) ( Men groaning ) Jyn . No . Return fire ! To your stations ! Get our fighters in the air now ! Father ! ( Indistinct shouting ) ( Groaning ) ( Shouting continues ) Male imperial gunner : Roger that . 3 through 7 . ( Guns firing and explosions ) Guard : Fall back ! Fall back ! we need to evacuate . ( Groaning ) ( Guns firing ) ( Exhales ) ( Man screams ) ( Mechanical voice speaks ) ( Groaning ) ( Grunting ) it 's me . It 's jyn . Jyn ? Stardust . Papa . I 've seen your message . I 've seen it . It must be destroyed . I know . I know . We will . Jyn . Look at you . I have so much to tell you . ( Galen groans slowly ) Papa . No . No ! Papa . come on ! Stormtrooper : Over there ! Take ' em down . Come on . Papa . Come on . we gotta go . Come on . I can 't leave him . he 's gone . Nothing you can do . Come on . - I can 't leave him . - Come on ! I can 't . Move ! this way ! - Cassian : Down ! ( Stormtroopers yelling ) Come on ! Come on ! Well done . You 're a rebel now . ( Dramatic music playing ) Bodhi : Let 's go ! Let 's go ! let 's move ! let 's get out of here ! move ! k-2 . Let 's go ! Copy that . ( Exploding ) Bodhi : Ion thrusters low until we 've cleared the storm . K-2so : Understood . You lied to me . You 're in shock . You went up there to kill my father . You don 't know what you 're talking about . Deny it . You 're in shock and looking for some place to put it . I 've seen it before . I bet you have . They know . You lied about why we came here and you lied about why you went up alone . ( Sighs ) I had every chance to pull the trigger ... But did I ? Did I ? You might as well have . My father was living proof ... And you put him at risk . Those were alliance bombs that killed him . I had orders ... Orders that I disobeyed . But you wouldn 't understand that . Orders ? When you know they 're wrong ? You might as well be a stormtrooper . What do you know ? We don 't all have the luxury of deciding ... When and where we want to care about something . Suddenly the rebellion is real for you . Some of us live it . I 've been in this fight since I was 6 years old . You 're not the only one who lost everything . Some of us just decided to do something about it . You can 't talk your way around this . I don 't have to . Yavin 4 . Make sure they know we 're coming in with a stolen ship . Anybody else ? ( Sighs ) ( Dramatic music playing ) ( Door hissing ) director krennic ... Has arrived . ( Mysterious music playing ) ( Draining sound ) ( Raspy breathing ) ( Darth vader theme playing ) Director krennic . Lord vader . You seem unsettled . No ... Just pressed for time . There 's a great many things to attend to . My apologies . You do have a great many things to explain . I delivered the weapon the emperor requested . I deserve an audience ... To make certain that he understands its remarkable ... Potential . Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed . A city destroyed ... An imperial facility openly attacked . It was governor tarkin that suggested the test . director krennic . No ... There is no death star . The senate has been informed ... That jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster . my lord . I expect you not to rest until you can assure the emperor ... That galen erso has not compromised this weapon in any way . So I 'm still in command ? You 'll speak to the emperor about ... ( Choking ) director . ( Gasping ) Pamlo : We must scatter the fleet . We have no recourse but to surrender . Bail : Are we really talking about disbanding something ... That we 've worked so hard to create ? We can 't just give in ! not a suicide pact . We 've only now managed to gather our forces . Gather our forces ? General Draven 's already blown up an imperial base . A decision needed to be made ! Pamlo : If it 's war you want ... You 'll fight alone . why have an alliance at all ? we need to act now ! please . It is simple . The empire has the means of mass destruction ... The rebellion does not . A death star . This is nonsense . What reason would my father have to lie ? What benefit would it bring him ? To lure our forces into a final battle to destroy us once and for all . Vaspar : Risk everything ?

We 've all done terrible things on behalf of the rebellion . Spies ... assassins . I did for the rebellion . And every time I walked away ... From something I wanted to forget ... I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in . A cause that was worth it . we 're lost . Everything we 've done would have been for nothing . I couldn 't face myself if I gave up now .

 ( irisa voice-over ) previously on defiance ... I don 't believe rahm tak will ever release alak alive . Ugh ! A fully functional omec warship Could destroy the entire votanis collective . T 'evgin needs to die . So long as that mad man has the power to expose us , He must obey his commands . Is that poison ? I 'll fill a hidden needle , And inject the omec during coitus . Why do you want me dead ? Actually , i don 't . I need to know i can count on you . ( nolan ) you had him , and if you hadn 't have choked , Rahm tak would be a cooling corpse right now , And defiance would be a whole lot safer . - You 're benched . - Nolan ! You 're gonna stay here with berlin , You 're gonna figure out who planted those explosives . I 'm the lawkeeper now . [ impact ] [ panting ] Ugh ! - Oh ! - Nolan ... [ winces ] [ choking ] Ugh ! Oh ... Whatever 's inside this man 's head is killing him ! [ rapid breathing ] [ pleasant music ] ¶ ¶ It doesn 't look broken . It 'll be fine . Here , this will help soak up the blood . - Thanks . - Oh , gross , gross , gross . Is it working ? - Pretty much . - Did you hit him back ? Are you kidding ? What is wrong with you ? He 's the biggest kid in the yard . I hit back , he hits me twice . It 's safer just to fall down . I didn 't raise you to be a doormat . Oh , so you raised me ? Don 't tell mom and dad . [ rumbling in the distance ] Look ! It 's the aliens ! ( rebecca ) get away from the window . It 's okay . Jon stewart says they 're friendly . [ whooshing and rattling ] [ gasps ] - Watch out ! - Ah . She 's got it . Josh , help me put this stuff back where it was . How did you know ? 'cause that 's my sister , rebecca . - No , everything looks fine . - Did anything break ? ( nolan ) and that little boy is me . Just put the stuff anywhere . - No . - Where are we ? ( rebecca ) everything needs to go back where it was . You know how ocd ... [ machine beeping ] How long has he been like this ? Hour , hour-and-a-half . We stopped to refuel and he just collapsed . [ gurgling ] We need to sedate him ! Top drawer , behind you ! You 've got some moves , kid . You a doctor ? Veterinarian . [ groaning ] I 'll take it . There 's a crash cart behind you . Grab it in case we need to defibrillate . I 'm on it . What 's wrong with him ? No clue . But we 're losing him . [ gurgling ] Do you think we 're dead ? I don 't feel dead . No . This is something else . You never said you had a sister . [ explosions ] [ gunfire ] [ explosions ] [ shouting ] [ gunfire ] Rebecca ? Josh , you gotta be careful with those rounds . They 're explosive tipped . I know what i 'm doing , i trained on the t9s . Hey , look at me . Focus . You 're scared and you 'd piss yourself If you weren 't so exhausted . So am i . But cooper 's unit 's coming through here tomorrow And they 're gonna need this ammo we 're guarding , okay ? [ explosion ] I know , i know . Hey . Those were empty coffins At mom and dad 's funerals . Why ? You have to bring this up ? They were vaporized . And we lost our parents . I want payback , don 't you ? Yeah . Yes . We 're nolans . We have one rule . We live together ... Or we die together . Good man . [ gunfire and explosions ] ( rebecca ) they 're getting on the roof ! I remember this . [ explosions ] No ! [ gunfire ] I got incoming ! Take out the i-rat ! [ grunts ] No ... More ... Fight . C 'mon josh , waste him and get over here ! Listen to her . Shoot him ! Please ! [ gunfire outside ] [ sighs ] Ugh ! [ gunshot ] [ gasps ] [ grunts ] [ impact ] [ grunting ] [ panting ] You 're all right . You 're gonna be okay . ( rebecca ) you have to hold the position . Everyone 's counting on us . [ gasps ] and ... Whatever you do ... Don 't ... Don 't ... [ somber music ] ¶ ¶ [ enraged grunt ] Aah ! [ gunfire ] Aah ! [ gunfire ] ( young nolan ) aah ! Tell me . I won 't . ( young nolan ) aah , come on ! I won 't . [ nolan sobbing ] [ panting ] I promise i won 't . [ mumbling ] [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ [ glass shattering ] One single task : Kill the omec . I poisoned him with enough zwimbo to kills a bell beast . But is the omec dead ? No . He 's at home smelling my wife on his fingers And chuckling about how he cuckolded the datak tarr ! I doubt t 'evgin knows your name . Incompetence is not a word i normally associate with you . Well , perhaps there 's something deeper going on here . Deeper ? What 's that supposed to mean ? [ luke crying ] And now look what you 've done , you 've ... You 've woken the baby . Hello , wee one ! Aww . That 's beneath you . Have you quite finished ? Was there more you wanted to say ? Shooting the omec is a stupid plan . Why is that ? I learned that omec become stronger as they age . T 'evgin is much , much older than he appears . I doubt a sniper bullet will do more than irritate him . Well , i 'm happy to put that theory to a test . An irritated omec is likely to hunt you down , Hang you from your ankles , And separate you from your spinal column . I 'd like to see him try . As would i . But it won 't help alak . How does any of this help alak ? Rahm tak is casti . He was raised on the same old enchanter stories we were . He fears t 'evgin , which is why he ordered us to kill him . If i can get t 'evgin on our side , We can exploit that fear to secure alak 's release . Why would t 'evgin help us ? Must i draw you a chart ? Contrary to what you think , darling , Your chivo is not magic . On many occasions you 've said different . You have to trust me . Of course . Always . Aah . [ panting ] [ man shouting in the distance ] Aah ! [ panting ] [ suspenseful music ] ¶ ¶ ( geeze ) favi tak ! The gun seller has arrived . ( rahm ) finally . Welcome . Your reputation precedes you , of course . I am general rahm tak of the votanis collective . These are lieutenants bebe , geeze . Pleasure . Please , join me for some wine . Back to work . Yes , boss . [ grunting ] [ dark music ] ¶ ¶ [ electronic beeping ] How bad is it ? He needs a machine to breathe , And i 'm keeping his heart beating with drugs . And he 's not responding to painful stimuli . Essentially , he 's brain dead . Is this true ? It seems that way . You 're asking dr . Dolittle ? Suddenly my word not good enough ? I just want to make sure everything possible Is being done to save his life . Wait , what 's going on ? Amanda 's afraid that i might try to kill nolan . Why the hell would you do that ? Well , because a couple weeks ago the two of them Held me down and skinned me alive . [ scoffs ] Come on , you 're--you 're kidding , right ? That didn 't ... Happen . You 're hazing me , right ? Welcome to the suck , jarhead . [ device pinging ] Whoa , hang on . Look at this . [ pinging ] - Brain activity . - Out of nowhere . And it 's not human . There 's a mass in nolan 's medial temporal lobe . I think it 's arktech . How is that possible ? It 's got to be from the sleeper pod that he shared with irisa . She 's got a scar just like this . [ pings ] I 've got a theory . Get irisa in here . Yeah , but i don 't know where she is . Well , if you want a shot at saving nolan , find her . Now ! [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ Hey . Have you seen irisa ? We 're not exactly soul sisters these days . Well , we have to find her or nolan 's gonna die . [ dark music ] ¶ ¶ Shtak , shtak , shtak . Where did you go ? ¶ ¶ Help me . - How did you know ? - Just help me . I 'm sorry about rebecca . I don 't want to talk about it . ( irisa ) she seemed like she really- - I said i don 't want to talk about it . - Should 've been me that died . - Don 't say that . She shouldn 't have even been there . I thought the war would help me prove something . Make me a man , or something romantic like that . Then i got there , the reality was anything but romantic Or noble , or even good . [ sighs ] Rebecca knew it would be like that . So she enlisted , she made sure she was assigned to my unit So she could protect me . She was brave . She didn 't care what anyone else thought . She was the type of girl who 'd rather be Under a car fixing it than in the backseat with a guy . All her friends loved taylor swift , But she lived for johnny cash . There was nothing about her i didn 't wanna be . If i had been stronger , she 'd be alive . ( tv commentator ) it 's been exactly one year since The fateful night that turned the tide of the pale wars . The night when every alien ship all over the world exploded . Many crashed to earth ... When are we ? This is the shaming rack . [ rock music playing ] A storm divide watering hole . ( tv commentator ) making space travel an impossibility . The majority of the wreckage remained in orbit And was dubbed the ark belt . The tragic event could not have come at a more opportune time For the earth military coalition , Since they were in danger of losing the war one year ago . This is the one year anniversary of arkfall . Every human i knew got plastered this night . ( tv announcer ) we spoke to emc ambassador olfin tennety , And here is what she had to say . Over the last year , one thing has become clear : We have broken the back of the votanis collective . They are not longer capable of maintaining their war effort , And this has forced them to the bargaining table . [ slam ] - war is over ! [ cheering and whistling ] - yeah ! ( tennety ) to quote a great earth leader , " peace is at hand . " Not soon enough for this guy , huh ? [ chuckles ] too true . I miss you on the front lines , no-man . - Oh . - How you been paying the bills ? Mm . You know how some of that ark wreckage Still falls from space to earth ? This guy varis pays top dollar for arktech . ( j-turk ) so you 're one of those scavenger guys with a little girl in tow ? The official term is arkhunter , my friend , and the kid loves it . Right ? She can climb into all the tiny spaces i can 't reach . Watch out , folks , father of the year coming through , huh ? Hey ! I 'm not her dad . I just helped her out of a bad situation . [ cell phone chimes ] Ooh ! Arkfall . I gotta go . I 'll settle up . No , you got the last one , j-turk . I got this one . Mm . [ indistinct bar chatter ] [ irath groans ] Earth is for humans ! - Yeah ! - Whoo ! [ rock music continues ] See ya , brother . ¶ ¶ I have no memory of this night . Did it really happen ? - Kiddo- - - don 't " kiddo " me . Did it happen ? It was a different time . [ whispers echoing ] [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ [ electronic beeping ] Hmm . Well , the daily special seems to be scrambled brains . What ? There 's an arktech cluster in irisa 's head , Just like nolan 's . And you want to know the kicker ? The minute you brought her in here , Both their vitals stabilized . And nolan 's breathing on his own . That 's good , right ? That means they 're getting better . Actually it 's bad . Very bad . Votan sleeper pods were not designed for humans . Sharing one forced the pod to make some modifications To keep if from killing nolan . What modifications ? The pod physically tethered nolan and irisa 's brains . Kept them both alive , but the brains grew interdependent , Like ... Organs on conjoined human twins . Right , both twins can survive , so long as they remain attached . Exactly . The omec severed the attachment , When it took nolan and irisa out of the pod . Now the arktech adapted itself , keeping the connection going Through a spread-spectrum signal . Like bluetooth ? You 're adorable . But sure , why not , let 's call it " bluetooth for the brain . " When you and nolan left town , the connection broke . But instead of a dropped signal , they got brain damage . Bringing them closer together reestablished the link , And stabilized their conditions . But unfortunately , it is temporary . The arktech is growing out of control . What can we do to save their lives ? Well , i need to open them up and cut the arktech out . Well , you 've done this surgery before , right ? Best not to dwell on that . [ sighs ] [ panting ] My hands are freezing , i can barely hold the axe . Just give me a second to warm them . - On your feet , let 's go . - Just give me a second To warm them , man ! [ knife strikes ] [ gurgling ] [ suspenseful music ] ¶ ¶ ( rahm ) bebe , geeze , let 's start unloading these crates . ( geeze ) favi tak . Good news with our guest ? ( rahm ) oh , he won 't stop talking , or drinking my wine . Right now , he and his biomen Are subjecting the men to old-earth show tunes . He 's the most disgusting human i 've ever encountered , And trust me , i 've been around . He would sell his weaponry to anyone who has enough scrip . No honor , no loyalty to his fellow humans . I 'm tempted to kill him just to make the planet a better place . I 'll deliver the death stroke myself . That 's kind of you , bebe . Thank you . ( rahm ) no . We may need to re-supply . It 's better if he leaves with a fat profit and we get our guns . Defiance won 't know what hit them . Don 't gloat , geeze . It 's premature . A lot of things have to go right for this plan to work , Including the element of surprise . That 's essential . I need to get back . [ sighs ] I 'm gonna find out if the carnivorous plant eats audrey . ¶ ¶ [ indistinct chatter ] [ both panting and moaning ] What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . I thought this would be a welcome diversion , But my thoughts drift to my son in that v.C. Camp . My husband insists i carry out their demands . Do you really believe my death would win his release ? I fear nothing short of a miracle will save him . It 's strange . When i close my eyes , i can only picture alak as a little boy . I keep remembering this one day . The humans have this ancient ritual called a picnic . Have you run across the term yet ? No . You eat outdoors among the flies and rodents . Alak was very young and insisted we try it . I confess it was fun in a dirty way . Until we encountered a hellbug skitterling . Alak thought it was cute and wanted to play with it . But i grabbed him in my arms and i ran . My husband tackled the beast . Killed it with his charge blade . Impressive . I held my son close , and i whispered over and over again , " i 've got you . I will always protect you . " Now i realize that was a lie . I wish someone will give rahm tak the same treatment My husband gave that hellbug . Someone strong . Someone fearless . [ chuckles ] someone like me . [ laughs softly ] It would be so easy for you . The sight of an omec ship over their camp would terrify them . They would submit to any demand . [ laughs ] or they , being resourceful And duplicitous , would concoct some trick to disable my ship . We could take precautionary steps . Kindzi and i are alone . We face the extinction of our entire race . Our only hope of finding other omec survivors Is with that ship . I would not do anything to put it in harm 's way . Not even for you . [ sighs ] Seems the mood has soured . [ devices pinging ] [ device whirring ] Hmm . We 've got a problem . What ? Every time i remove a piece of arktech from nolan 's brain , The arktech in irisa 's brain grows larger to compensate . I need to figure out a way of removing the arktech From both of their brains at the exact same time . Okay , well we have two doctors , So we could do two surgeries at the same time . What do you say , slick ? Any experience doing cranial nano-surgery ? Well , i ... I once removed a tumor from a cat 's brain . And it lived ... For , like , a year and half . Talk about healing hands . All right , fine . What other options do we have ? Well , i need a surgery module , one that would allow me To operate on two patients with one set of hands . Okay , well , where can we get one of these ? Nowhere close . But i 'm pretty sure that i can make one . All i need is an omec drone . Is that a problem ? Where 's your father ? He left , and did not tell me where . Leave this place or i will make you leave . Nolan and irisa will both die if you turn us away . Please , remember , nolan fought for you . He saved your life . Because of gunshot wounds inflicted by you . Don 't punish him for my mistakes . What is it you need ? If i can interface with one of your drones , It can perform one surgery while i do the other . And steal our technology , no doubt . Is that your plan , crafty little indogene ? Do you play both sides ? See , mandy and i have this bet going- - Doc , shut up . Please , kindzi . I can 't lose him . I will help you . But then the scales are balanced . We owe you people nothing . Understood . Remember this , indogene , i am a skilled techno-biologist . You try anything tricky when you 're connected to my system , I will see it , and i will kill you quickly . Now , see , i was gonna kill you slowly . I like a little bit of foreplay . [ dark music ] Shall we get started , ladies ? ¶ ¶ [ gasps ] ¶ ¶ [ exhales ] [ sighs ] ¶ ¶ Here , spot . Come to mama . [ electrical buzzing ] Good ball . [ stirring music ] ¶ ¶ So far , so good . Why did you keep me if you hated us so much ? Because when i looked at you , i didn 't see an enemy combatant . I saw a scared kid who needed my help . Besides , you were different . Different how ? Well , you were born on earth . You weren 't like the votans we fought in the war . Are you you adopted me because i wasn 't alien enough to hate ? - No . - Because i am a votan . No different from the millions that died . Yeah . But you were too young to experience the horror . You never saw the years of the worst of the pale wars . Please don 't kill me . I don 't want to die . He came after us because of the bounty on our heads . Please , i have a family . What is this ? I 'll tell people that i never found you . I don 't think we 're seeing these things randomly . A lot of scrip if he brings us in . You think he 's just gonna give up and go away ? Let me go . [ sighs ] Dead guy over here ? He called him " odolo . " ( young nolan ) it 's casti for " brother . " He 's honor-bound to avenge is family . There 's no way he 's gonna pack it up and go home . So maybe one night he comes up on us , Slits our throats , is that what you want ? No . So what do we do ? Follow through ? Follow through . [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ Casti heart 's on the other side . ¶ ¶ [ gunshot ] I know that wasn 't easy for you , kid . I 'm proud of you . All right , so let 's get this roller packed up And get out of here . [ poignant music ] ¶ ¶ I 'm sorry . ¶ ¶ Don 't tell me i didn 't grow up with horror . [ whirring ] [ suspenseful music ] ¶ ¶ ( datak ) come on . Move . Or i 'll do you both . I want you to know that i understand . You have to put your own family first . I appreciate that . [ speaking native language ] [ laughs ] [ slight laugh ] Have you tried pow vindaloo yet ? No . You are in for a treat . This way . Alak ! Why are you unattended ? I-i begged sagyan for a break . I couldn 't take the smell of those bodies . Well , i 'm gonna have to talk with sagyan about his leniency . It 's odd , though , the smell bothers you . You were married to a human . I 'm curious . Did you have to scrub really hard To get the smell off your gwavayo ? [ laughs ] [ gunshot ] Agh ! [ groaning ] [ suspenseful music ] [ engine starts ] ¶ ¶ [ gunfire ] [ laughs ] I know this place . I 'm sorry . What ? About the bounty hunter . I didn 't know it affected you so much . I 'm not sorry for the lesson , though . You would 've been dead years ago If i hadn 't taught you how to survive . [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ [ can crunches ] [ inhales ] [ groans ] hi , kiddo . What 's wrong , you can 't sleep ? Too cold ? Come on up . Come on , up here . Ah , that 's it . Good . Was that real ? Something 's happening . Was it real ? Did it actually happen ? Thought about it . I don 't believe you . Believe what you want . No , i remember that night . That was the first time i thought everything Was gonna be okay . It was the first time we started to feel like a family . It happened . Why ? Because i was scared of you . I was scared of you . [ rumbling ] [ inhales ] They 're awake . Thank god . [ both groaning ] How are you feeling ? Ugh . Yeah . ( nolan ) dizzy . Irisa , how are you feeling ? [ exhales ] shtako . All right , move slow . [ sighs ] You scared me . I don 't know what i would have done without you . [ poignant music ] ¶ ¶ ( t 'evgin ) you should never have allowed them in here . Where is this indogene now ? She took nolan and irisa back to town for more tests . I should strip off you skin and feed it to my bulel . You are my commander . It is your prerogative . Don 't you understand the danger ? You allowed a shape-taker to access our network . An indogene ! She could have seized control of our drones . A network is a two-way street . She was so busy with the surgery , She failed to notice That i copied her cerebral source-print . [ inhales ] You got it all ? Everything . This particular shape-taker , yewll , is smart , Even by indogene standards . Her expertise will prove valuable Once the maret adziim begins . [ dark music ] You 're very resourceful . But also reckless . Destroy it . Why ? Creating new indogenes would turn defiance against us . We are omec . We feed upon the lesser races . We do not fear them . I fear anything that will disrupt the flow of gulanite And prevent us from repairing the tsuroz . You are young . Two bullets from a human almost killed you . Have you forgotten this ? I will never forget that . Follow my orders . Destroy it . Of course , commander . ¶ ¶ [ sighs ] [ indistinct shouting ] [ sighs ] Does your head hurt ? A little . I can taste something . Burnt tires ? [ laughs ] that 's it . So ... If you 're that scared of me , Why didn 't you just sink the knife and be done with it ? Because i 'm not you . Something pulled these memories From both our minds to understand that . So we could both see the lie That 's kept us together for all these years . What lie ? I never lied to you . You taught me to believe we 're the same . Yeah , we both grew up with blood in our hands . It made you okay with killing . But not me . I hated it then and i hate it now . I think that 's why i didn 't stab you . I have to leave . There 's no place for me here . Not with rahm tak coming . If i stay , i 'll have to hurt people , And if i don 't , i 'll get you killed . Don 't you worry about me . You can 't protect me and the town at the same time . I know what you have to do . It takes a killer to stop a killer . I know what you have to be , But i don 't want to be here for it . Okay . " live together , die together . " Works when you have to keep on fighting . It totally sucks in real life . [ laughter ] There 's a land coach coming tomorrow . Well , you let me know where you end up . Maybe when this is all over i can join you there . Maybe . [ poignant music ] ¶ ¶ I just finished going through your post-op scans . I didn 't want to say anything until i was sure . Sure about what ? I wasn 't able to remove the arktech , so i repaired it . Strengthened to the connection . You two will remain stable So long as you don 't separate again . Meaning ? Meaning if you get too far apart , You 'll strain the connection , excruciating pain , Killing you both , the whole magilla . How far is too far ? I don 't know . A mile , maybe more . - [ sighs ] - [ scoffs ] Why the long faces ? You two are practically joined at the hip anyway . [ sighs ] " geez , thanks , doc yewl , For saving us from certain death . " Hey , no problem kids , any time . Grab a lollipop on your way out . [ dark music ] ¶ ¶ Go away . But not too far , obviously . ¶ ¶ [ sighs ] [ soft native music playing ] ¶ ¶ What is rahm tak like in person ? Excuse me ? I shame myself . The question was impertinent . No , it 's all right , andina . Why do you ask ? I saw his image the day the arch fell . He 's very handsome . Dangerous looking . Yes . I prefer my men dangerous , don 't you ? Generally , they prefer me . ¶ ¶ Some of the other servants think Humans have brought all of this upon themselves . All of what ? The righteous wrath of the votanis collective . If humans had been better about sharing their planet , Then we wouldn 't hate them . That 's rahm tak 's whole message . There 's more to it than that . [ gasps ] [ stirring music ] ¶ ¶ [ both scream ] You--you 're in shock . You killed christie . Oh , no , no , no , i didn 't- - Shut your lying mouth ! There 's always an excuse . You 've never told the truth . [ whimpering ] ¶ yes we 'll fight now for our funding ¶ ¶ and we 'll fight for what we 're worth ¶ ¶ and we 'll take back for tomorrow ¶ ¶ this good old hell on earth ¶ ¶ whoo-hoo ¶

 [ chickens clucking ] [ Marcy groans ] Hi . [ David ] Oh , hello . Are you just watching me sleep ? Oh , well , you know , just ... patiently waiting for you to wake up . So , uh ... we could do this ? [ drill engine running ] What 's wrong ? I 'm fine . It 'll pass . - [ panting ] - Marcy , you 're bleeding . [ drill rumbling ] [ grunts ] [ grunting ] Oh , hi . It 's Grace Day , calling to confirm my appointment for 11 : 45 . [ car alarm beeps ] Great . I 'll see you then . Thanks . Trevor ! [ gasps ] David ... I 'm scared . It 's okay . I 've got you . - [ gasping ] - You 're gonna be fine . No , no . Marce ... No . Come on , hon . - [ gasping ] - Marce ! [ David shushing ] [ screaming ] [ ringing in ears ] [ ringing stops ] [ wire snaps ] [ drill engine whirring ] [ engine cuts off ] [ birds chirping ] [ laughing ] [ theme music playing ] Coffee ? Well , it 's the least I could do . The least you can do is nothing , and then leave without telling me , which is what you usually do . I 'm ... gonna get better . Are you ? Mmm-hmm . Here . Try it . Is it good ? It 's coffee . - [ cell phone vibrating ] - Sorry . Just , uh ... - Don 't let me stop you . - MacLaren . David ? Yeah , of course I remember you . What ? Okay , I 'll be right there . [ stammers ] I 'm sorry . You have your priorities . And you are one of them . [ gasping ] No ! No ! Stay calm . Ms. Day , I can explain . - What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm trying to help you . Please , just relax . - Help me ! - Stop ! - Please , stop yelling . Stop ! - Help ! There 's nobody for miles . This is all happening for a reason . You drugged and dragged me into the woods ? I sedated you , yes , but only because I had to get you out here . Off the grid . Away from all technology . - This was the only way I could be sure . - Sure of what ? What are you gonna do to me ? In the historical record , Grace Day dies at 11 : 27 a.m. on the corner of Westlake and Harmon Avenue . That 's by my dentist . How ... how would ... I scouted the location . It was impossible to determine what would kill you , and if I had intervened ... Well , the traffic cams would 've allowed the director to take you . The director ? Look , I know how it sounds , but I 'm not a crazy person . Well , do you know this director ? - The director sent me here . - To do what ? Perform missions . [ sighs ] Like this ? No . No , I 'm breaking protocol by doing this . Our mission ... is to save the world , Ms. Day . I 'm from the future . [ EKG monitor beeping ] [ David ] Agent MacLaren . Hey . [ MacLaren ] David . Thanks for calling . - Yeah . - You mind giving us a moment ? Yeah . No , of course . I 'll ... I 'll just , uh ... [ MacLaren ] Thanks . What happened ? [ sighs ] I 'm sorry . I told him a thousand times not to ... [ coughs ] Not to take me to the hospital . No , that 's okay . It 's fine . This is exactly where you should be . Have they told you what 's wrong ? I mean , do you ... Do you want to check your charts ? I know what 's wrong . There 's too much pre-existing damage . - I don 't understand . - [ sighs ] My host 's brain was congenitally underdeveloped . I came up with a treatment that I thought was working . [ sighs ] I 'm sorry that I didn 't ... It 's all right . We 're gonna fix this . I don 't think that it 's ... possible . You just helped to practically bring me back from the dead . Anything 's possible . - Hello ? - [ Jacqueline ] Carly , hi . I wasn 't sure I 'd be able to reach you . Oh , I 've been off the grid for a day or so . I 'm sorry . Are you in any danger ? It 's okay , you can tell me . Uh , no , I 'm fine . Why ? What is it ? Well , to be honest , I was ... hoping you might have reasons beyond your control for why you abandoned your son at his father 's . Abandoned ? He 's the father . I 'm well aware , but as he tells it , you asked him to watch Jeffrey for a couple of hours , - and haven 't returned since . - [ scoffs ] That was two days ago . I 'm ... I 'm heading there right now . Your actions indicate that you trust him as a caregiver , so I have acted accordingly and filed a recommendation for his father to take custody until the hearing is settled . Jacqueline , please ! Have a good day , Ms. Shannon . Wait ! [ sighs ] [ robotic voice ] Traveler 3468 , please greet arriving Traveler 0014 today . [ normal voice ] Where 's my mom ? Uh , excuse me . This ... this boy 's looking for his mom . [ Trevor ] It 's a calculation , really . The director studies the historical record and then assesses which actions to take , some big , some not so big , that will best mitigate the conditions we left behind . - And how 's it going ? - That 's hard to say . See , a while ago , we deflected an asteroid that would 've caused a huge disaster 18 months from now . - Yeah , well , that 's very big . - That 's what we thought ! We expected that it was gonna impact the future so much so that we might even cease to exist , but nothing 's changed ! So if ... if something doesn 't work out the way you want it to , why don 't you just go back and try again ? [ chuckles ] That 's an excellent question . We tried that , of course . But for some pretty complicated reasons having to do with ripples in space time , we can only go as far back as the arrival point of the most recent traveler . There 's no do-overs . Anyway , now you know why I 've missed so much school . I appreciate your honesty , Trevor . [ chuckles ] I know you don 't believe me . That 's okay . Neither would I. I still wanted to tell you I was doing this to preserve your life , because you 're a good person , and the director will just have to find another candidate . [ MacLaren ] Philip ? [ Philip ] Over here . [ MacLaren ] Anything show up ? [ Philip ] No . Nothing yet . We 've only got two potential hosts for today . First one gets hit by a truck here in about an hour , and the second one dies streetside just before that . - These are the locations . - Okay . You take that one , I 'll take the other . Sorry , but what is our mission exactly ? To greet Traveler 0014 . - 0014 ? That 's a low number . - No kidding . Why is the director sending back someone so important ? I 'm hoping it 's to help Marcy ! [ door closes ] [ David ] Hey . Here you go . We gotta make sure we keep fluids in you . Yeah , that apple juice is really gonna make all the difference . Sorry , I just ... I know you 're trying to help . - That 's okay . Nobody likes hospitals . - [ doctor ] Hey ! That 's not a very nice thing to say . How are you feeling ? Uh , I 'm ... I 'm okay . I 'm just tired . Can I ... Can I ... [ grunts ] - Can I go yet ? - [ Doctor ] Mmm . Afraid not . We still have a number of tests we 'd like to run , and unfortunately , your MRI didn 't turn out . What do you mean ? Well , it 's just that if the scan was accurate , you 'd barely even be able to communicate with me right now , but it 's no big deal , we just need to do it again , and I 'll put a rush on this one for you . Don 't worry . Everything else appears stable . So I will let you know as soon as we get you slotted in , okay ? Thank you , Doctor . All right . - [ metal snaps ] - [ man ] Look out ! [ man ] Damn it , Morrison , you were on that ! [ Trevor ] This is the list of potential host candidates ? [ Philip ] Not all of them , obviously , but yeah . [ Trevor ] Then all these people are gonna die ? Yeah . Why ? What 's wrong ? I know this person . Shit . [ man ] It wasn 't my fault ! - [ com beeps ] - Trevor ? Trevor , where are you ? [ Philip over com ] Trevor , what the hell have you done ? [ Trevor ] There . That should do it . We passed your time of death . You feel fine ? [ stammers ] Other than the obvious discomfort . Good . Then it wasn 't anything medical . Okay ... Uh , what is that ? I 'm gonna take you back now . You can claim a sick day and stay home . That doesn 't answer my question . See , this is gonna erase the last 24 hours from your memory . To you , it 'll be like you overslept and none of this happened . And if I refuse ? I 'm afraid this is part of the deal for saving your life . Not to mention , I told you a whole lot of things no one can ever know . Okay , but so what happens next ? You knock me out and you drag me back out through the woods ? [ stammering ] You 've been favoring your side like it hurts . [ groans ] Stitches . I had some surgery the other day . Organ donor . Well , ow ! [ laughs nervously ] Why don 't I just walk back out with you ? You know , you don 't want to tear those stitches , and it couldn 't have been easy carrying me all the way out here . Okay . But I have to keep your hands tied . I understand . [ Trevor clears throat ] [ grunts ] [ Philip over com ] Boss , you there ? Yeah . Nothing 's happened at my T.E.L.L. yet . - Any luck with yours ? - No , nothing . I guess that 's one less candidate . No , I mean nothing happened . A crane dropped its load on the sidewalk . No one died . No traveler arrived . You sure you had the time right ? It 's possible the historical record was off . Some of my bets didn 't turn out , - a few race results I 'd memorized changed . - What ? Why didn 't you tell me ? [ sighs ] It was just a few races . Boss , to be honest , I don 't think that 's it . I think Trevor might have intervened . What makes you think that ? Back when I wrote all those T.E.L.Ls on the front door of ops , he said he knew one of them . Grace Day . No . No , Trevor wouldn 't break protocol . [ brakes screech ] Oh , shit . Okay . [ sighs ] You look for Trevor . I 'll work on a backup plan for Marcy . - We need to talk . - Carly ! - What a ... a pleasant surprise . - Don 't . Don 't ? Don 't what ? Don 't do what you 're doing . - Playing these games . They won 't work . - Okay . You 're not gonna get Jeffrey from me . I don 't have to take him from you when you straight up hand him over . Look , you are manipulating the wrong person ! Jeffrey is my blood ! My son ! And I could not be more serious when I tell you ... You 're trash . What the fuck you just say to me ? I said you 're trash . And it 's only a matter of time before your son sees it , too . - You watch your mouth . - Or what ? You know you don 't deserve to be a father . You 're a mess . And yet I 'm the one taking care of him while you bail for days at a time ? Yeah , well , someone had to make me feel like a woman . God knows you never could . You know , when you 're close to me like this , I can really smell what a failure you are . I see what you 're doing . When will you learn that I am not an idiot ? You come to my work like this again , and I 'll file a restraining order . [ cell phone vibrating ] David ? Can you get me some more juice ? Yeah , no problem . Thanks . Just push that if anything happens while I 'm gone . - [ com beeps ] - [ panting ] Guys , get me out of here . They want ... [ gasping ] to run more tests , and if my MRI comes back with the same results , they 'll be doing experiments on me till I die . Philip , hack their database and get my file , okay ? You got it . [ breathing heavily ] - Sit tight , Marcy . - [ com beeps ] Hi . I was called in to speak with an Agent Forbes . [ MacLaren ] Uh , Forbes is my partner . I 'll take it from here . Thanks , man . - Uh , come on in , Officer ... - Boyd . Boyd . You really need to stop making a habit of this . Protocol 6 . This is an emergency . Our medic 's in the hospital , and her condition might be beyond 21st-century medicine . The director will send help if the intention is to save her . Well , help hasn 't arrived , and she 's getting worse . And you 're coming to me why ? I just want access to your team 's medic . No . Could you at least ask your medic , let them decide for themselves ? I just did . I 'm the medic . And team leader ? Yeah . We lost ours along the way . Someone had to step up . Well , then you , of all people , should understand . We 're just trying to do everything in our power not to lose one of our own . Just have a look at her . That 's all I ask . [ cell phone ringing ] [ David ] Hello ? [ MacLaren ] David , I need your help . We gotta get Marcy out of the hospital . Is that a good idea ? I wouldn 't be asking , okay , if this wasn 't serious . Well , she 's ... she 's got doctors and nurses coming in every five minutes . - I have a way around that . - Okay , look , I wanna help , but you said so yourself , this is exactly where she needs to be . Well , the situation has changed . If the doctors continue to test Marcy , her cover will be blown . I don 't care about her cover . This is important work , David . She told me she was dying . And I have no intention of letting that happen . I have a plan . But the only way I can pull it off is with your help . What do you need me to do ? I need you to be in her room at exactly 1 : 07 sharp . - Can you manage that ? - Yeah , of course , then what ? [ MacLaren ] Stand by . [ cell phone beeps ] [ Grace ] So why haven 't you gone back and stopped Hitler and Stalin ? [ Trevor ] I love the way your mind works , but actually , we 're only able to come back to the modern age of computers because we need the precise time and location of the host 's death . Close doesn 't work . - Then you 're not really Trevor ? - No . You remember my concussion ? When my consciousness arrived , it supplanted his just before the last punch would have killed him . Instead , I conceded the fight , and here we are . - Here we are . - Yeah . [ grunts ] [ Trevor ] Whoa , whoa , whoa . Grace , are you okay ? - Grace ? - [ grunting ] [ Trevor groaning ] [ Trevor ] Grace ! [ grunting ] Grace ! [ Grace panting ] Okay . Oh , God . All right . Okay . Grace ! Grace ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Grace ! Grace ! Grace ! Hey , hey ! Hey , hey ! [ muffled shouting ] [ Grace panting ] Stop ! Grace ! [ Grace screaming ] [ panting ] - Grace ! - 0115 , are you out of your mind ? You do not get to change history on your own ! [ stammers ] But I saved her . How could you possibly ... She made a phone call . GPS , voice recognition . Oh , great , I 'm bleeding . Been here less than a minute , and already my body 's damaged . Well ? [ monitor beeping ] [ beeping stops ] [ beeping resumes ] Knock , knock , Marcy . It 's time for you to head into your MRI ... I am so sorry . - You murdered her . - Oh , get over yourself . Historically , Grace Day died today . Don 't get mad at me because you got caught trying to play God . Well , candidates shouldn 't be taken after their T.E.L.L. has passed . It happened . It 's forever . So get over it . Are you here to deliver the repercussions ? No , I didn 't jump here to spank you . I have a mission to complete . If I can get this goddamn car started . [ engine starting ] - [ both sigh ] - Huh . Now what ? [ Boyd ] Home lumbar puncture is pretty unorthodox , but looks like it helped relieve some intracranial pressure . What the hell did you do with the CSF ? She made a serum to help stabilize the neurotransmitter levels . Smart . Kept you alive for this long . But you know it could only buy you so much time . I know . [ sniffles ] Of course you do . You 've known the whole time . It must have been brutal . Okay , I can give you a neurotransmitter stimulant I developed for a mission - that should help you short-term , but ... - Thank you for the second opinion . I wish it was a better one . What ? That 's it ? That 's all you can do ? What about nanites ? There are a number of medical traveler teams capable of amazing things . Yeah , we know . But that takes orders from the director . That should start working right away . You okay ? Thank you . - How long does she have ? - Not long . The shot I gave her should help her feel more or less normal for a little while , but ... her neurons are still going like fireworks . But , hey , if the director wants her saved ... - Yeah . Thanks . - You 're welcome . Check in with your team . Why ? Because I 'm also on a mission to locate 0014 , and by now , they should have his coordinates . They were sent a messenger this morning . So check in and use this so I can hear both of you . [ dialing ] Trevor , where the hell have you been ? [ Trevor ] I 'm sorry , I felt like I had to do it . You broke protocol ! But the new traveler showed up anyway . Yeah , we 'll talk about that later . Is she 0014 ? [ Grace ] Oh , for God 's sake ! They haven 't located him yet ? If he didn 't arrive after the messenger , check the T.E.L.Ls from before . Why would the director order us to greet someone who had already arrived ? [ stammering ] Who am I talking to now ? Call me Grace . We share the same mission , Agent MacLaren , and it involves Marcy . There 's one potential T.E.L.L. from earlier today . Uh ... - A farm outside of town . - Is that it ? Obviously . Send us the coordinates and meet us there with your whole team . - Here . - [ Grace sighs ] Philip , follow when you can . Carly ? You 're with me . [ barking ] [ doorknob rattling ] Come on , 014 . Open the damn door . It 's safe ! My name 's Ellis ! Get off my property ! - I 'm not gonna hurt you . - What about the kid ? He 's nobody ! Come on . We don 't have much time . Why should I trust you ? 'Cause without me , you 'd still be writing shitty script prompts in a leaky dome like the grumpy , no imagination , old bastard you are . 027 . I 'd recognize that tone in any century . - Call me Grace . - You here to hide , too ? Partly . Your defenses are up ? With you ? Always . - [ laughs sarcastically ] - Got ' em up just after feeding the pigs . - I got pigs ! [ laughs ] - Okay . I want your code . What makes you think I 'm gonna give it to ya ? And you are ? Trevor . You look like somebody shot your puppy , Trevor . Do I ? She 's not a real people person , but her heart 's in the right place . You 'll see . Come on in . All right . Come on . Get in here . [ Ellis snapping fingers ] So , how 'd you find me ? My team did . They 'll be here soon . Your reinforcements . 014 needs protection . He wrote a backdoor hack that a faction in the future is desperate to get their hands on . What faction ? A group is trying to topple the director , and they wanna use my code to do it . - I came here to hide it , so it 's useless . - Not useless . [ Ellis ] How 's it gonna help you in the 21st ? I 'm trying to save somebody 's life . [ Ellis ] Hmm . Is that so hard to believe ? - [ Ellis ] Yes . - Definitely ! I made a mistake that needs to be corrected . [ scoffs ] Hacker with a heart of gold . You 're programmers . - This one 's the director 's favorite . - Only when you 're not around . - So how 's my code gonna save a life ? - You 'll see . And don 't worry . I 'll destroy it as soon as I 'm done . Wait . You need it now ? [ scoffs ] I was just gonna start on supper . Oh , he can do that . Do you know how to prepare food ? Yeah , sure . Well , hurry up . I haven 't eaten in centuries . You 've reached Special Agent Grant MacLaren . Please leave a message . Agent MacLaren , it 's , uh , David Mailer . I really stuck my neck out back at the hospital , and I 'll probably run into some of these people again , and now I 'm just waiting on a Marcy update , so I 'm not gonna lie to you ... Feel a little pissed off . Which isn 't to say that I 'm unwilling to help , obviously I am , but there 's a difference between helping someone and being used by someone . - So , call me back . - [ cell phone beeps ] [ clucking ] [ MacLaren ] Trevor ? Trevor ? - [ knocking on door ] - [ dog barking ] [ Ellis ] Who is it ? [ MacLaren ] 3468 . I received a message to greet Traveler 0014 . [ Ellis ] Well , then ... greetings ! - [ MacLaren ] Uh ... - And you ! Greetings ! [ MacLaren chuckles ] So what 's the mission ? You tell me . We just told you . Our mission was to greet you . Then mission accomplished . You folks hungry ? Your friend 's cooking supper , though I think he was expecting a couple more . Yeah , they 're on the way . Finally . Where is she ? You must be Grace . [ typing ] [ MacLaren sighs ] [ knock on door ] What 's going on ? There 's a plan you need to be aware of . These two are programmers . They want to try an experimental procedure on you . [ Marcy ] What sort of procedure ? [ MacLaren ] Well , they say it could correct your condition . [ Ellis ] Table isn 't gonna set itself , folks . Grace wants to talk to you . [ Grace ] Over here , Marcy . [ typing ] Uh , my team said you think you can help me ? Well , Marcy , nice to meet you . Just give me one second here . I 'm almost done . - There we go . - [ computer beeps ] Sit . How conversant are you with the theory of quantum entanglement ? Um , I know it 's the basis of how we transfer consciousness . And in order for that to happen , an alignment has to occur . Unforgiving precision . A misfire will kill the incoming consciousness . We need to be 100 % locked in . - [ grunts ] - [ Grace ] That 's great , Marcy . Thanks . What was that ? Oh , just a calibration test of sorts . Now , let 's eat ! [ Grace ] Not only was I part of the programming group , I was the team lead on the social media research . You found the host candidates ? Yes . The early successes made us overconfident in our analysis , so when we came to Marcy 's host ... What 's this one again ? Carrot . - Carrot . - [ Trevor ] Mmm-hmm . This is spaghetti squash . My host has a refrigerator full of something called bacon . When I realized what it was , I cried for a good five minutes . You would . Where was I ? You were saying how you got Marcy 's life wrong . Oh , right . Well , I can 't tell you how much I regret that , Marcy . Uh , people make mistakes . I understand . But you don 't understand how I intend to fix it . No . I don 't . By repackaging your original upload in order to bypass the damaged areas in your host brain . It really is brilliant . How does this process not lose information ? Oh , it does . Of course it does . I had to prioritize . A few memories , some life experiences will be lost , but the human mind is full of useless things . You won 't even be able to tell the difference . What about all my memories of the 21st ? Well , obviously none of that . I didn 't have access to it , did I ? Just think about this as a reboot of the original . A reboot ? What will happen to her current consciousness ? - [ Grace ] Same thing that always happens . - It 'll get overwritten . - You mean she 'll die . - [ Grace ] It will be her . By any reasonable definition , she will be Marcy . Just not ... this one . [ indistinct conversations ] [ Marcy sighs ] I should have told you . [ MacLaren sighs ] Would it have made a difference ? [ Marcy ] No . [ MacLaren ] Was it ever a threat to the mission ? [ Marcy ] I don 't think so . Privacy might not exist where we come from , but it does in the 21st , so ... Thank you . And really , what kind of an asshole would I be if I started yelling at you now ? [ chuckles ] We 'll brief you after the transition , in detail . Philip will remember everything . No . Not everything . [ sighs ] I 'm not the same person today as when I arrived . Doesn 't matter how long ago it was . It might as well have been centuries . In a way , it was . You can tell her events and missions , and everything you can think of in the most minute detail , but ... you can 't tell her ... What ? - Doesn 't matter . - Why do you say " her " ? Because she won 't be me . She won 't remember ... the most important part of who I am now . I 'm not gonna sit here and pretend to know what makes us who we are . But I gotta figure it 's more than just the sum of what we remember . Yeah , you 're right . And I won 't lie to you . You 're important to us , and I don 't wanna lose you . I 'm really just ... one person on one team . That happens to be here to save the world . So there 's that . [ sighs ] I 'm not gonna tell you what to do . [ door closes ] [ sighs ] [ Grace ] Oh , there she is . - What if I don 't go through with it ? - [ Grace ] What ? What if I refuse the procedure ? Why wouldn 't you go through with it ? You 'll die horribly . Don 't I have the right to die on my own terms ? [ Grace ] No . Do you have any idea the trouble I 've gone through ? And I 'm grateful for that , I 'm humbled by it , but I 'm asking the question , - is it an option ? - No . I think it is . You have a responsibility to the grand plan . You 've taken an oath . Can I just ... have the time to go home and think about it ? Home . It 's important to me that I see someone before I make this decision . Fine . Thank you . Come on . We 'll take you . [ engine starting ] Well , that didn 't go as planned . Are you sure we 're safe here ? - Uh , I 've taken measures . - Well , will they be enough ? I also got a shotgun . [ cell phone chimes ] Thanks for coming in . I just didn 't really want to be alone right now . Of course . David will be home soon , so I 'll just go make some tea while we wait . [ door closes ] I 'll give you a hand . I 'm gonna give her a hand , too . What the hell did she say to you to make you consider not having a medic on our team ? She didn 't have to . I know what she 's going through . Do you ? What happened to " the mission comes first " ? She just needs a little time . I 'm sure she 'll make the right decision . You shouldn 't have given her the choice . It 's a little more complicated than that , Carly . Look around . She has a life in the 21st . We all do . Some of us have made sacrifices in order to do what we came here to do . This isn 't about any one person 's happiness . Tell me . What is it about ? [ Carly scoffs ] [ sighs ] [ Trevor ] I have a unique perspective on this . In the early days of testing the technology , my much younger consciousness was transferred out of my body and back again . That 's not really the same thing . You still had your memories . [ Trevor ] It was ages ago . Who can remember ? My point is , I was still me when I returned . I didn 't feel any different . Neither will she . [ Philip ] " She " ? You 'll be the same person , Marcy . So everyone keeps saying . [ Philip ] My perspective is entirely selfish . I just don 't want to lose you . All I know is ... I just need to talk to David first . I didn 't realize you had someone that important to you in your life . Neither did I. I mean , obviously I can 't tell him what I have to choose , but I think ... just ... sitting down and ... - [ Philip ] Marcy ? - [ Marcy gasping ] Marcy ! [ ringing in ears ] [ Marcy screaming ] [ continues screaming ] No ! [ ringing stops ] [ gasping ] [ MacLaren ] Marcy ! Stand down . [ Trevor ] We 're your team . [ panting ] This isn 't where I 'm supposed to be . We know . You 're safe . What 's going on ? This isn 't your original T.E.L.L. [ MacLaren ] Traveler 3569 . Welcome to the 21st . [ panting ] [ typing ] Marcy ? - Agent MacLaren ? - Hey , David . What 's happening ? Thank God . I thought something terrible had happened to you . You must be David . I 'm told we 're close .

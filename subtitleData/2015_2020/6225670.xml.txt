 Bearing 0-4-5 . Steady 10 knots . I can 't see . Sir ? Sir ? Holding course , steady . - Depth - - sonar ? - Captain ? Bearing 0-4-5 ... Captain ? Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , God . What the hell is going on , Sean ? Everyone 's dead but us . We lost the captain . We 're all alone . There 's no answer from the base at Faslane . How we gonna get home ? Sean ! We 'll get home , bruv . How do you know ? Because I do . Hope . Such a rarified concept these days . High in demand ... and short in supply . I 'm enjoying recording these logs again . Until recently , I had given up on them . With no connection to the outside world , they were serving as little more than just a diary . But now with the satellite network up and running , they have become my trusty carrier pigeons . I am happy to report that the cure has landed safely in labs across the country and in Europe , and I am on my way to you , Dr. Hunter , my friend , my mentor . We 'll be stopping first in Savannah to set up a lab there , before heading down to you in Florida with the cure . As promised , I am uploading my data to the secured satellite , and I would love for you to take a look at the work we 've done , and get your thoughts on faster methods for replication . Because time , as you well know , is of the essence , and millions still continue to live at risk . So take of yourself , old friend , and I 'll be seeing you shortly . The door to the autoclave still won 't shut , and we 're nearly out of ethanol . I know . We 've been running the equipment at full capacity . And with what those troopers did to us in Baltimore , it 's a wonder that anything is working at all . Excuse me , ma 'am . You need to see this . Hospital ship U.S.N.S. Solace departed Naval Station Norfolk two weeks ago bearing south-southeast . - Destination ? - That 's just it , sir . The harbor master log doesn 't show one . So it headed out to sea to avoid the pandemic , maybe create a safe hospital offshore . That 's what I thought , sir , but then I checked the ship 's manifest , and aside from a skeleton crew from the military sealift command to run the ship , there were only 15 doctors on board . I mean , that 's well below reduced operating status . With the plague , maybe that 's all that 's left . Even so , master chief , the Solace was especially retrofitted before going underway - - negative pressure equipment , incubators , thermocyclers . Precisely the tools one needs to make a biolab . 15 doctors , all that equipment - - think that 's the missing lab from Norfolk ? It has to be . Put on a ship and moved offshore . - Let 's call ' em . - Aye , sir . They brought enough equipment on that hospital ship to build a lab three times the size of ours . With the cure , they can produce tens of thousands of doses a day and get them directly to the people who need it . South America , Europe . We 're gettin ' another ship . Gentlemen . Now I know how much all of you like carrying a load , but the truth is we could use a little help . So I want to introduce you to two of our new team members . Both of these sailors were part of the Navy 's special warfare joint operation training program in Norfolk when shit hit the rotors about three months ago . They volunteered to join us on our mission south . Senior Chief Taylor , Royal Australian Navy . You can call me Wolf . He is the real deal . A diver , E.O.D. Expert , and all-around operator . - Proud to join the team . - Welcome aboard . - Hey , Wolf . Tex . - Hey . And this is Lieutenant Ravit Bivas . Israeli Defense Forces - - expert diver and intelligence operator . Wow . We are a regular coalition of the living . That 's right . Now let 's make our new friends feel welcome , Show ' em the ropes . That is all . - Hey , man . - Lieutenant Burk , Carlton . Yeah , sounds great . You know , when I was deployed in the gulf , I spent some time outside Tel Aviv , a town called Gi-va-tayim . - Givatayim . - Right . Congratulations . Hey , Wolf , let me ask you a question . Do you think them Navy regs on fraternization apply to foreigners ? You better check the rule book . I 'm just being hospitable . I say again , this is U.S.S. Nathan James hailing U.S.N.S. Solace T-AH21 in the green on sat-hi-com . How do you copy ? Over . Still nothing , sir . Sir , I 'm assuming that if they took the lab from Norfolk , they brought their call sign with them . You try hailing them on navy red or fleet tac ? Yes , sir . No joy . Nothing on their mars station frequencies either . Gator , hospital ships still use their beacons don 't they ? To announce their presence as noncombatants ? Yes , sir . Prerecorded voice broadcasts once per hour , that 's the rule , but the range is over the horizon , and we 're not picking anything up . Well , they couldn 't have gone too far . Bridge , this is the Captain . Come to course 1-7-5 , all engines ahead full . Harbor master log said they went south by southeast . - Let 's find ' em . - Aye , sir . Hospital ship 's nearly twice the size of ours . It 's a 70-foot climb from the water up to the O2 deck . There you go . Steam powered , one screw . Yeah , but no guns . I 'll take a smallboy any day . Hell , yeah . Built to fight , just like us . That 's nice . Keep that left hand up . - I know . - Yeah , yeah , you know . Come on ! You punch like a girl . Nice . Nice . Caught you slipping , buddy . Come on , Tex . They 're just friends , by the way . Had a little convo with Wolf . All right , not that you 're interested . Whoa , hey , hey . What 'd he say ? He says she 's like a sister to him . Yeah ? Just don 't break her heart . You don 't wanna tangle with the big brother . The United States Hospital Ship Solace transmitting in the clear without encryption or secret codes as required by article 34 of the second Geneva convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded , sick , and shipwrecked members of the armed forces at sea . United States ... It 's a diagram of the Grace , sister ship of Solace . From what I understand , they 're practically identical . They most likely constructed their labs here , two levels below the O2 machine . Best place for negative pressure and ventilation . - You 'll want to check - - - Excuse me . Sir , we picked up Solace 's beacon . O.O.D. reports they are in range of bridge-to-bridge , but they 're not answering our hails on any channel . They still moving ? It appears not , sir . Why does this story sound familiar ? This bloody virus ... Well , at the very least , we 'll be able to salvage their lab , right ? That 'll be our mission . Once we get the ship secured , you can jump onboard and take stock . Then off to Florida and Georgia . The labs are waiting for us . I 'll alert the team , bring you right up alongside . Master chief . They put themselves out to sea , Waiting for us . And we were late . So , Wolf . Badass name . Who gave you that ? My mother . All right , cool . Yeah , you 're probably used to your Tavor rifle . MP7 's better for close in fighting , But could be a little tricky . Yeah , guess you got it . Just didn 't see it coming . I was working joint operations down in little creek . Yeah , things got bad real fast . I mean , one day , they 're talking about a few isolated cases of this crazy flu . The next thing , there 's general havoc and the airports are closed . We went from setting up hospitals to enforcing quarantines to running for our bloody lives . Nobody knew which way was up . I always wondered how it all went down here . Yeah , most of the big cities in Australia were hit pretty hard , too . Never managed to call home . My brothers , my sister . This place isn 't exactly home , but ... you 've got a family here . Appreciate that , Miller , really . Hey , can I talk to you for a second ? CIWS is down , But we 'll have S.C.A.T. teams ready for you if you need support . All right , well , we 'll be ready . Yeah . I , uh , saw your new team members . Come on . Jealousy is a useless emotion . I agree . I 'm just saying all the girls are talking about the man from down under . - G 'day . - G 'day . This is United States Warship 1-5-1 on your starboard bow , Hailing you over channel 1-6 , over . - Port and starboard lookout watches set , sir . - Very well . O.O.D. starboard R.H.I.B. is away . Very well . United states hospital ship Solace , this is United States warship 1-5-1 on your starboard bow ... I hold Solace at all stop with slight bearing drift to port . O.O.D. recommends steady course 1-8-0 maintaining 600 yards C.P.A. Very well , helmsman . Steady course 1-8-0 . 1-8-0 , all engines ahead 1 / 3 for 3 knots , aye . All right , Tiger team - - Tex , Ravit , Burk . Start aft and starboard , clear your way to the lab . The rest of you on me . We go port and forward . You come across anyone still alive , save who you can with the doses you are carrying . - Am I clear ? - On it , sir . - Aye , sir . - This way . Let 's find that lab , Tiger team . Nathan James , this is Vulture team . Radio check . Reading you loud and clear . Expect radio drop-off once we get in the skin of the ship . Next check in five mikes . Roger that . Good luck . So the vaccine your doctor gave me , you sure it works ? Oh , yeah . I wouldn 't be here if it didn 't . Amazing . Burk , what do you see ? A whole lot of nothin ' , sir . Same here . No sign of life . Or death . Where the hell did everyone go ? Sir ? It 's been five minutes , sir . Vulture team , this is the bridge , Radio check . Radio check . Bridge , Vul- - team . Hey , no ... life . Vulture team , say again . Your last was garbled . Bridge , Vulture team , I say again , no sign of ... Vulture team , say again . What 's going on in here ? For me ? Sir , you hear that ? Over there . Hey , Stella , You know what ? Inside the cake is ice cream , too . Chocolate mint . You do or you don 't ? Do . Okay , say good-bye . Bye . Found a body . - Virus ? - I don 't think so . Two shots to the back , one to the head , High-powered weapon . Blood 's still wet . More blood over here . Nathan James , Vulture team , this is Tiger , do you copy ? Do you copy ? Commo , bridge . I need a better signal . Vulture team . Nathan James , Nathan James . Holy mother . They were lined up and executed . Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! U.S. Navy . What 's going on here ? Be careful . They 're still on the ship . Tiger team , be advised , Hostiles operating onboard this ship . Location unknown . Do you copy ? I ... we ... we got ... 12 Solace crew , K.I.A. Burk ... read me ? Vulture team , we got a dozen Solace crew down . Believe hostiles may still be onboard . I say again , hostiles may be onboard . Vulture team , do you copy ? ... team , be advised ... ship . Again , hostiles operating onboard this ship . Set general quarters . General quarters . General quarters . All hands , man your battle stations . General quarters is up and forward to the starboard side . Down and aft to the port side . The reason for general quarters is hostile activity onboard south . Tex , Burk , do you read me ? Sir , they boarded about 20 minutes ago . - How many ? - At least a dozen . Now we figured , pirates , locals from the islands desperate for food , medicine . Now we 've had those before , but these guys , These guys came out shooting . They think we have the cure . They were going after the wrong ship . That was you ? The folks secnav was talking about ? That was us . I 'm Chief Mate Gonzalez . They killed our ship 's master . We held down as long as we could . I 'm so sorry . No , sir . I 'm sorry . C.I.C. , bridge , Hostiles operating aboard Solace . I need a 360 surface search . They didn 't come from nowhere . Find me a ship . Get us in there closer . Prepare the weapons . Aye , sir . Helmsmen , left 15 degrees rudder , All engines ahead two-thirds . Everybody , listen . Let 's stay together . We 're getting out of here , all right ? Doctor , we gotta move you . I 'm - - I 'm not going anywhere , This man 's chest is filling with blood . We can 't move until I get a tube in him . Just ... give us a minute . Scalpel 36 french . Nurse , stat ! Where 's this lab you built for the cure ? It 's down a level back aft in a converted I.C.U. , but the pirates went there first . Burk , secure the lab , level three back aft I.C.U. I say again , secure the lab . Roger that . Let 's move . - And where are these pirates now ? - I have no idea . But we heard some shooting , like , 10 minutes ago , up by comms . Wolf , Miller , let 's probe our way aft . When we exit , break right . Take starboard , we 'll go port . - Flush out contacts . - Aye , sir . Cruz , get everyone in here secured , then join the fight . - Aye , sir . - Officer Gonzalez . - Sir . - Look like you did prior service before becoming a merchant mariner . 20 years . Surface warfare . Firing on an unarmed hospital ship 's a war crime . You know this ship better than anyone . - Let 's make ' em pay . - Aye , sir . Anything on surface search ? No , ma 'am . Nothin ' . Let 's check underwater . - Mason . - Ma 'am ? I need you to run sonar . You passed the murder board . I need a 360 degree sonar search . - You can do this . - Aye , ma 'am . I 'm going to man the starboard Mark 38 . Fastest way to comms is through here . Hey ! Freeze ! Hold it right there . U.S. Navy ! Toss out your weapon ! Jesus . Did you see that gun ? These are not pirates . You ever been shot before , Miller ? Can 't say I have . My advice ? Avoid it . On my six . Now . Miller . Miller . Vitals holding . He 's stable . Not a minute too soon . HM2 Dulac . Secure the occlusive dressing on the chest . Everyone , back behind the equipment and turn out the lights . Don 't open this door for anyone but navy . Understood . I 'll be back . This is it . This is the lab . We got company . I can 't tell how many . I got eyes on three . Fine . Make sure they 're clean head shots . We wanna preserve the lab . On my count . Copy that . Ravit ? Ravit ? Hey , hey . What are you doing here ? Looking for the cure ? I 'll give it to you . Good shoot . Nice move . Yeah , but we 're too late . Damn . Vulture leader , Burk . They destroyed the lab looking for the cure . I say again , the lab is destroyed . Not sure what we can salvage . Sorry , sir . Well , get out of there . But be advised hostiles are heavily armed and well-trained . Roger that . Come on , Ned . The bloody U.S. Navy 's all about the ship . We got what we came for . Let 's get out of here . - Gracias . - And miss all the fun ? Ding-dong ! Hey , U.S. Navy , it 's bad luck for you happening on this ship , but this is the end of the line for you . Because we know how to fight better than you do . And if it 's a fight you want , It 's a fight you 're gonna get . Whoa ! Hold your fire . Sir , doctors are secure . About a dozen more M.S.Cs holed up in the engine room . Your boys took out three hostiles with ropes and wrenches . Nice . All right , well , we can 't fit everybody on that RHIB . And there 's no clear way down . We can get everyone out on the tender boats . O2 level , starboard side . Okay . On my order , get ' em there . Captain , thank you . Don 't thank me yet . First , we clear a path , and then I 'm going after the man behind that voice . Come on , keep up . No word from Giovanni or the others . We 're losin ' men . We should give the order and jump ship . Not until we kill every last one of them . That wasn 't the plan , Ned . Your brother said we sh- - Don 't you every bring up my brother to me ! I know what he wants ! I am the only one that knows what my brother wants . So let 's just do what needs doing , yeah ? And then we can go . You 're lucky I won 't tell Sean how you cocked up the job today . We got gunfire . Topside . - Foster ? - No target . Sir , if we get any closer , we could collide . Chance we have to take . Bring us in closer . - Find me something to shoot ! - Aye , sir . - Nice shooting , Miller . - Thanks , wolfman . Hey , wolfman . I like it . Ambush . They don 't ambush us . We ambush them . Nathan James , what 's your whiskey ? Comin ' up your starboard side , 400 yards , lookin ' for a target . Well , I 'll give you one . Flight deck . We flush three hostiles topside , you light ' em up . Roger that . Batteries released . Aye , sir . Starboard Mark 38 hot . On your count . Three ... two ... one ! Lost ' em in smoke . - You got one . - Roger that . - These guys are good . - Too good . Look for a military ship , a helo . There could be more where they came from . Looking . Sonar , bridge , anything on that subsurface search ? Nothing in the water , sir . There could be a ship hiding out in the deep blue . Vulture Team , Vulture Team , no RHIBs , no helo . These guys didn 't just swim here . - How 's the patient , doc ? - He 's still stable . Glad to hear . Okay , we found the others . A dozen more survivors . Oh , thank God . Okay , everyone , we are getting you all off the ship . Let 's go . This way . Let 's get the hell out of here . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . I 'm gonna jump on the stretcher . Vest . Guys ? They 're gonna blow the ship . Vulture Team , hostiles have rigged the ship to blow up . I say again , hostiles have explosives . All hands , all hands , abandon ship towards the lee , starboard side . - Get to those tender boats . - We need to get out of here . - No . - No ? We lost the lab . We 're not gonna lose the ship . Okay ... does anybody know how to diffuse a bomb like this ? Nathan James , we got about 18 doctors and crew , one of them hurt . We 're about to load them into the tenders . - Did he say doctors ? - Mm-hmm . We 're gonna need cover , though , starboard amidships . Roger that . I 've got something on sonar . Possible submarine in the bounce . Are you sure ? I ... It 's gone . Bridge , TAO , possible subsurface contact , bearing 0-5-0 relative . Request bearing , clear or foul . How you looking , Lieutenant ? Don 't talk . Let 's go , let 's go , move it . Let 's go . Right in here . Move it . - Everyone accounted for ? - Yes , sir . All right , guys , come on , steady . - Let 's go , let 's go , move it ! - Load ' em in . Come on . Get on that boat ! I hope that 's Hebrew for " A-okay . " Now that is an oxygen tank we can 't move . Let 's go , let 's go ! Get ' em into the rear ! Down ! Get down ! Get ' em back to the James ! Do not wait for me ! Let 's go . Move . Move it ! Let 's go ! Come on , get up . Go , go , go , go ! Taylor , you all right ? Yeah , through and through . Oh , this bullet hit the carotid . I 'm with you . All right . There 's a remote detonator . Contact trigger . If I pull it , it will go off . Well , how do you stop it ? - Ravit ? - I 'm thinking . I need to keep contact on the metal . Captain , we got a little hitch in our plan here . We 've taken care of the first bomb . There 's another one with a remote detonator . And oh , boy , it 's a big one . I don 't think we can diffuse it . Get your asses off the ship . Doc , let 's go ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm with you . I 'm with you . It 's okay . Doc , I 'm sorry . We gotta get you on the boat . Get out of here ! That 's everybody . We gotta go . Well , lower the boat . You got two on top . Good shot , MA1 . I 'm blocked off . Where are you , mate ? Juan Carlos ? Get off the ship , man ! Whatever you do , don 't let ' em catch you . - You got it ? - You guys need to get out of here . No , we 're not leaving - - No , you don 't understand . The detonator is inside . It needs to be metal to metal . It - - the pressure release , I can 't do it ! Aw , hell . Step away . - What the hell are you doin ' ? - I got an idea . It has to stay in contact with the metal , right ? Go on , skedaddle . What does that mean ? Tex , are - - you know what you 're doing ? Make a hole . End of the road . You 'd like to shoot me . That 'd be nice , wouldn 't it ? Just a word of warning - - I let go of this button , And this whole ship gets blown to kingdom come , including you And all the little people that you 're trying to help . You may blow up this ship , but I promise I will take you with me . Well ... Shit . Shit . Captain 's in combat . Sir , no air or surface contacts on radar . Negative E.S. in the area . We spotted at least eight hostiles diving into the water . Aside from the one we clipped who 's sitting in our medical bay , The others never came up for air . There were no other boats around Solace , No R.H.I.B.s , no rafts . Ah , Cruz said he found some wet suits with the hostages . My guess is they came in on 2-man subs , S.D.V. Agreed . They 're military . Any indication whose flag they 're flying ? They weren 't nice enough to wear uniforms . Mercenaries , then . Hunting the cure for the higher bidder . Hospital ship was a natural target . Mason , are you sure you saw a sub out there ? Sir , I 'm sure of it . Hidden out there in the seabed ... It was a sub . Well , keep searching the water . The minute you find anything , I wanna know . - Aye-aye , sir . - Yes , sir . Welcome aboard . Thank you . - Good as gold . - Thanks . Hey , Wolfman . I 'll never play the fiddle again . Never say never . You 'll regret that . Doctor Milowsky , I 'm so sorry that you all got caught in the middle of this . We left behind family , friends , all of us working in isolation . Solace was our last hope . You have the cure , and they destroyed my lab . It 's a great loss for us all . Chief Mate Gonzalez saved our lives . I just wish I could 've saved his . So what happens to us now ? Well , your ship is seaworthy , you have enough crew to get you and your associates back to Norfolk . We have people there . You 'll be needed and greatly appreciated . We 'll send you back with doses of the cure , obviously . I wanna stay here with you all . I 'm an expert in vaccine manufacturing and genetic engineering . If you 're spreading the cure , I 'd like to be a part of it . I 'm sure we could use the help . It would be an honor to have you . You okay ? Yeah , it 'd take , uh , more than a bullet to knock me out . I 'm just glad we all got back in one piece , more or less . You , uh ... did real good out there today . I 'm glad to have you on the team . What ? I like you guys . You 're crazy . It 's a miracle he survived . The lord works in mysterious ways , Deacon . No doubt about that . While he was conscious , he was muttering what sounded like Spanish , but you said your guy had a British accent . An international band of thieves . How 'd they get their hands on a sub ? Well , if this man ever wakes up , we 'll find out . So , you guys , is someone gonna explain to me where we 're going in the middle of the night here ? I told ya . There 's someone who wants to meet ya . Was there a problem ? You didn 't find the ship ? Oh , yeah , we found it . So great news . You see ? I told you . Right ? I was right ? Standard protocol for emergency preparedness , all hospital ships go offshore . Niels , he said they found it . He didn 't say nothin ' about good news . What was the problem ? You didn 't find what I told you ? No , we found the United States Navy ... A ship . You found the Navy ? Yeah , it 's like they knew we were comin ' . You guys , that 's them . That 's them . That 's Captain Chandler and Rachel ... That , um , Dr. Scott . I mean , they have the cure . Did you catch them ? You think I had something to do with that ? You guys , I assure you , the last time I saw that ship , we were , like , a few miles from Jamaica . I swear . If you suspect that I somehow set you up ... I categorically deny any involvement in any kind of ... Do us a favor , Niels . Stop talkin ' . You can save your bellyaching for the boss . The ... the boss ? Let 's go . The boss .

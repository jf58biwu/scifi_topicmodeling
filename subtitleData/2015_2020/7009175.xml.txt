 Ali , we 're gonna break even in months . We should have been drug dealers years ago . They sold the drugs through a soap store . I need you to tell me that Delphine is alive . I saw her get shot . Your sisters ... I know how they feel sometimes . Those aren 't dreams . I thought my DNA was supposed to make it better . It takes time to develop a therapy . Share the original 's genome , and together , we can make a cure . You bartered my mother behind my back . Cosima needs a cure , I need this bot out of my face . There 's some kind of Trojan wiping our research . Everything is gone . Clones are obsolete . These shites aren 't worth the salt . Oh , my God ! Hello ? It 's over . Where are we ? What is this place ? It used to be the edge of the known world . It still is . Welcome to The Island of Doctor Moreau . What are you talking about ? Why have you let me out ? The original is destroyed , Rachel . The cure along with it . - Mum ... - I 'll speak . All right . You put my mother in the line of fire . Laid your moves without me , and then you put me in the middle and you made it my fault . And now I don 't even have a body to bury . She was my blood , too . You came to me an orphan . That 's all you 'll ever be . - Then I don 't need to stay here , do I ? - No . You 're not taking Kira where you 're going . You don 't know where I 'm going . I know too well . Kira stays with me . No tears , Cosima . Hey . What 's up ? You okay ? She had her killed right in front of me . She kept me alive so I could tell everybody that Kendall 's ... gone . And Delphine 's dead . It 's not your fault , okay ? I got your favorite . Bad coffee and a good croissant . I pushed Sarah to make that deal . I pushed us right into Evie 's trap . She killed our hope , Scott . What are you doing over there ? I 'm gonna power up again . Why ? There 's nothing left . Well , we 'll see . Oh , Lord ... I know I 've been a horrible sinner , but we need hope now . We need ... Oh , fudge . Fudge it ! Fudge me ! Honey ... Honey ? God . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - Scheisse , Donnie . Come here . Come here . - We 're gonna get through this . - Mmm-hmm . You take whatever time you need for the sisters . - I got you covered . - Thank you . Thank you , Donnie . But , hey , I think maybe we should cancel Gemma 's slumber party . No , no , it 's ... It 's her birthday . I 've made all the arrangements , Donnie . Honey , it 's too soon . We can come up with an excuse , and we 'll have cake with her ourselves . No , Gemma needs this night . It 's ... It 's important that we make this normal now for the kids . There are hot dogs in the freezer , mister . I 'm putting my foot down . You can 't just capitulate to Evie Cho . LEDA is the cornerstone of Neolution . I was going to show you this when I came back with the original . There 's no point in hiding it any longer . Very few people are privy to the true history of Neolution . We date back to the Victorians , to this man . - Percival Westmorland ? - Mmm . - The industrialist ? - Born to industry . Drawn to Darwin and early eugenical thought . He used his resources to essentially create a secret scientific society . Percy sought to bring science to the task of breeding a better human . You 're sleeping in his very room . Over a century ago , he built the facilities downstairs . I built on top of him . And now , Evie Cho builds on top of me . I gave up everything to continue his legacy . Ethan , you ... And now my time is over . How can you give " P ? I 'm recovering , like you wanted . I want to take my place with you . We still need to find a cure . Look what you 've done for me . Look at my eye . It 's almost perfect . But I 'm afraid Evie has usurped us . In the 20-odd years since I Landed on your doorstep , I 've only seen you cry a handful of times . Now would be appropriate , if you like . Will you get me another cup of tea , love ? Of course . Where 's Sarah ? She 's gone . She go out ? Mummy left again . No . She doesn 't do that anymore . She did . No . Not like before . 'Cause that 's not an option , is it ? Your mum can look after herself . She 's well good at that . Darling , you listen to me . Don 't listen to S. You listen to your little heart . 'Cause I 'm gonna go find her , all right ? Mmm-hmm . Okay . You should know better . Everything is gonna get worse if Sarah goes off the rails . You like it or not , but she 's the give that 's holding us all together . Hey ! Two more . Is anything recoverable ? The malware did exactly what they intended , completely obliterated your data . Evie 's covered her bases . Without Kendall , without our research on the synthetic sequences , we have nothing . We 're back to square one . We still have a live vector . Which didn 't work . Every single test failed . Why would we repeat an experiment if we don 't even know what the flaw is ? We don 't know if we have the right sequences , or if it 's even the right vector . So let 's think outside the box . There you go . Listen to your lab partner . Yeah , she 's dead , too . No offense , Scottie . Some taken , actually . So there 's gotta be something you haven 't thought of . - What the heck is that ? - Sarah 's bot . I poached it from Evie 's office . Hey there , little buddy . I wonder if you can tell us anything . Cosima said the man who , uh , pulled the trigger was tall , bearded . She thought maybe the detective you tied to Beth . It 's Martin Duko . That 's Beth 's union steward . Does he work for Evie Cho ? He 's the one who put Beth under Evie 's thumb , drove her to try and kill Susan . Thank you , Arthur , for sticking with us . Evie ... It 's the big clay , congratulations . Your science has won . Looks like just in time , Dr. Van Lier . Shingles . Yes . A side effect of leaning on immunosuppressants most of my life . Well , you brought gene therapy a long way . Miles since we treated you when you were a teenager , Evie . Miles ? Ian , you 've always said , " This is a science of nanometers . " I am so proud of you . You have pending approval for the world 's first gene therapy implant . It 's affordable , it 's effective ... So good , even the Brightborn CEO is doing it . You 'll be first to take the new generation of bot this week . Those shingles will be a thing of the past . And so will human clones . How are you feeling ? I 'm fine , Mother . Just glad you 'll be here to share in my retirement . Yes , it 's fortunate you found such an ineffective means of suicide , Ira . Rachel ! That 's all right . Let 's just not talk about it anymore . - Are we ready ? - Mmm . Susan . Evie . Laura . Raymond . I thought it fitting that Rachel represent LEDA in transition . I was wondering when you 'd show up , Rachel . Yes , I ... EVE " . Cat got your tongue ? That 's okay . It 's just a courtesy call . So , the architecture of Neolution is under our control . Finance and Legal are backing my patents now . After investing billions ? Squandering for years . LEDA will be dismantled for its assets , the monitor program terminated . And my subjects ? Naive clones are being cut loose . No need for a Helsinki event . Their days are numbered , anyway . However , Sarah and her self-aware sisters are still a threat . They won 't get such humane treatment . I can help with that . We 're fine , Rachel . I 'm not my sisters . I 'm Neolution bred . Do you actually think Neolution would let a clone take a position of real importance ? Cheers . Hey , now . Oi ! See , it 's one thing to show up on my doorstep looking for a favor , but my local is another story . I should 've known this was the kind of shithole that you would inhabit . Hey , now , a man 's watering hole is sacred . I 'm here for this , that 's it . Don 't worry . - Well , cheers . - Cheers . Did you find out anything more about that implant ? What 'd I just say to you ? Oh , what do we talk about , then , if not clones and conspiracies ? I dunno , titillate me . Slippery nipple ? Slippery what ? Nipple . It 's a kind of shot . But this is just bourbon . Bourbon 's my drink . - Is that your friend , over there ? - Yeah . Yeah , that 's Tito . I 'm Elle . - You wanna introduce us ? - I 'd love to . Come over . You coming or what ? Yeah . Wouldn 't wanna miss anything . Okay ! The kids will be here any second , Donnie , so if you could be of some assistance ? Ali ... Ali , Gemma will still love you , even if the decorations aren 't symmetrical . Please don 't , please . I know you 're just trying to be strong , but I really want you to be able to talk to someone . Even if that isn 't me . What does that mean ? I invited Reverend Mike over to help with the ghost stories . - Ahoy , there ! - Hi ! Hendrixes ! I 'm not prepared for this . - Hi ! - Hi ! I come bearing gifts and , well , tidings of great joy . Oh , I see that . Thank you , Reverend . Oh , Alison ... So how are you ?

Okay . No , thank you , Sandy . Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm on my way there now . That was for Kendall Malone , and this is for Beth ! You Fri ... You frickin ' psycho . You killed for them ! And all Beth wanted was the truth ! That 's it , Arthur . Gimme the shoe leather . Get that outta your system ? That 's pretty much all you can do about that . Ah , see , Duko , we 're just getting started . What are you gonna do ? You 're gonna bring ' em all down ? Yeah , starting with you . Then Evie Cho . You can 't stop them . But they 're watching you . Collaborating with Sarah . Abetting the Hendrixes . And what about Beth 's shooting ? The cell phone in the victim 's hand ? Who really put that there ? They 're coming for you , Arthur . Then the only question you really should be asking yourself right now is ... Is , " Where is that next blow gonna land ? " How about right here ? The island is really big . How big ? As big as a country . We 're in the fort , and beyond the walls there 's monsters . I 'm afraid we 're the only monsters here . And it isn 't an island . It 's more of a prison for us . That 's silly . You 're a big girl . You need to know the truth . You and I have a problem . One that we share with Ira . What is it ? You 're sick . You 've already displayed symptoms . That 's why Susan 's been testing you . I always have tests , Rachel . It 's nothing to worry about . Yes , it is . There is no cure . I 'm sorry , Charlotte . You 're dying . And one day I will be , too . As Julia crept down the dark hallway , towards the back door ... she heard it again . The knocking . And there on the back step was her brother , Ryan . His face was white , like he had seen a ghost , or was he a ghost ? Oh , hey . It 's you . You 're still here . Well , I guess I am . Got a problem with that ? You , like , her boyfriend or something ? We met earlier , and we decided to have an open relationship . Well , whatever your kink is , why don 't you just piss off . Oi , don 't tell my mate Dizzy to piss off . Piss off . Hey ! - Wanker ! - Oh , easy ! - Hey , what did I just say ? - Don 't touch her . Come here ! Come here ! - Come on . - What , are you scared , ya ... - Come on , come on . - Yeah , you come here ! Little wanker ! Oh , yeah , great , great . Get the cops down here now . It 's like babysitting some football hooligan . West Hams ! West Hams ! Sing it ! West Hams ! - That 's enough . - Yeah ? All right . And where 's our next drink coming from ? You rs ? - What 's that ? - Mmm , something to take you down a bit . Is that what you need ? Listen , uh ... I can be honest if you can . Oh , he wants to talk . I didn 't help you find MK out of the goodness in my heart , - all right ? - Mmm . I have a friend whose name is Ed . He had one of those implants in , too . He , uh ... He was freaking out , trying to get rid of it , and they , uh , they killed him . Is that Ed Capra ? That 's right . How do you know him ? You need to stop talking now . All right . I can do that . Hey . Your implant , it 's gone . How did you get rid of it ? I said I 'm off the clock , didn 't I ? Sarah , come on . I 'm out . I don 't fancy you either , mate . Okay , never mind that for a second , but just listen . My ... My friend Ed wasn 't the only one with one of those things driving him crazy . You know how to get rid of it . I don 't know anything ! All right ? I wanted a bit of fun . You can 't even get it up . Wanker ! Stop following me ! I 'm not ! You 're in my place . Jesus Christ . A ball of fire made the ghosts explode ! And suddenly , Julia found herself safe in her bed , away from all the ghosts . And she was drifting off to sleep when she heard ... at her chamber door . What happens , Daddy ? The door swung open , and it was the ghost holding a birthday cupcake ! - Okay , that 's weird . - I 'll get it , I 'll get it . - Is it the ghost , Daddy ? - It might be the ghost , yeah . With a birthday cupcake ? With a birthday cupcake . I might eat it . Police ! - Oh , my God ! - Donald Hendrix ? Yes ? _ oh , my God ' ! You 're under arrest . - What are you doing ? - Down ! Down ! Everybody get down ! Get down on the ground ! Get him up ! Hands behind your back . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! What is this about ? It 's a children 's slumber party ! You 're under arrest for trafficking of narcotics . You have the right to the aid of attorney . Get up ! Come on . If you can 't afford one , one will be provided . - Oh , my God . - Honey ? Call someone , I don 't know ... I don 't know who , maybe , maybe uncle ... Alison . - Where are they taking my husband ? - He 's gonna be fine . I 'm taking your husband downtown . And you and I , we are going to need to keep in touch . How are you holding up ? Kendall was quite a loss . Hey , chicken . You okay ? - I 'm fine . - Mmm . No , you 're not . None of us are . Is it really Mummy 's fault Granny died ? Mmm ... It 's a whole lot more complicated than that . Mummy thinks it 's her fault . That 's why she ran away . But she 'll be back . No , she won 't . This time she 's following Beth . Amazing how it healed itself . Okay , so we compared Sarah 's DNA pre - and post-bot . We couldn 't see any change . Susan said it was looking for the gene that controls the clone disease , flipping switches on and off . You think there 's a chance it could turn it off in you ? That 's crazy . It could just as easily turn something else against you . I know , it 's too risky . Plus , we wouldn 't even know how to implant it . Cut a hole in my face and stick it in . Probably not . Hell Wiz ordered some food . Come on , let 's eat . Hey , Cosima . Got your favorite . There 's , uh , spirulina in the smoothie , too . Aw , awesome . Thanks , guys . Um ... just gonna grab ... Hey , Cosima ? Cosima , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? I 'm trying to buy a train ticket . I want out , and I don 't even have a credit card . Here , use mine . Oh , wait , you maxed it out already . It 's okay . I didn 't need it anymore . I never knew you were funny . That 's a relief . Oh , shit , I 'm talking to a dead person . You gonna follow me for the rest of my life ? Tonight 's our last night , I hope . Cosima . Cosima , please ! Open up the door ! Cosima ! Cosima , open the door ! - Cosima ! - Leave me alone , Scottie . Cosima , come on . Think for a second . You 've got no idea what this thing is going to do to you . It 's risk versus reward . In this case , the risk is so high the reward is my death helps the sisters understand the disease . I didn 't want this . I didn 't want you . I didn 't want any bloody sisters . You hear me ? Leave me alone ! I wish you would just ... What ? What are you looking at ? Eh ? Piss off . We would have been better off if we never crossed paths . God damn it , I 'm so mad . How mad do you have to get to kill yourself , Beth ? It 's only , like , 40 feet down . If you screw that up , you might just end up like Rachel . No ! So , now you 're worried about Sarah ? Felix , Kira said something . You know the way she is . She said Sarah is following Beth . Mum ! This is what I was talking about . This is what I tried to tell you . Now , will you just ... Hang on . Scott ? Hello ? Cosima 's locked herself in the lab , and I think she might do something medically crazy to herself . Like what ? Scott , what ? I have multiple emergencies right now , so you need to tell me . She 's at the end of her rope , Felix . She blames herself for Kendall . She blames herself for Delphine . Delphine ! Oh , my God , Krystal . I 'm such an idiot . I completely forgot . Scott , okay , tell her to pick up her phone , please . Cosima ! Just keep going towards the train station . Thank you . I 'm looking for someone . Cosima ! Felix is calling . Pick up ! Cosima , open the door ! Cosima ! Come on , pick up your phone , Cosima . Pick up your bloody phone . Dude , I think we way overbuilt that . Cosima , answer your phone ! You need to talk to Felix ! Krystal told him something important . Not a good time , Felix . Whatever cracked out science thing you 're about to do , I need you to stop and I need you to listen to me , because this is about Delphine . What about her ? Somehow , during Krystal 's misguided but oddly effective investigation , she found herself on the trail of Delphine . Now , she saw her get shot , and that 's bad . But , Cosima , she saw someone else pick her up . And Delphine was alive when they took her away . Cosima ? We 're gonna figure it out , okay ? Thank you . We 're in this together . just hang on . Oh , shit , shit . Hey ! Stop the car . Please stop . Cosima , I gotta go . Can you just pull up over here , please ? Thank you . There 's more than biology between us , Sarah . There 's something else . You can feel it , too . Oi , Sarah . This isn 't the way , is it ? You 've gotta be stronger than her , Sarah . Bring us together , Sarah . We need you . Hello , Kira . Who are you ? - How do you know my name ? - Don 't worry . I 'm a friend . You 're the girl in the shadows . Am I ? You can call me Mika . Good morning . Susan ? Is anybody there ? Dear God . Rachel ? Ira ? Ira , did you see it ? What happened ? You must have hit your head . It looked at me . I ... I saw something in my eye . What a fine pair we are , aren 't we ? ♪ Jesus Christ Superstar ♪ Gonna give you a little jail house 101 . The only people you should be talking to are Alison and me . You and Beth were right . We can 't do this alone . You need to work with someone who knows what they 're doing . Yo , Rachel . Yo . No matter how bent Duko is , she can 't go killing a cop . It 's some black Irish shit . You know , revenge first , consequences later .

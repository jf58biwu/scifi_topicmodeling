 LUCY : Previously on Killjoys ... Killjoys , huh ? Reclamation agents . We offer one simple service . Find who or what you 're looking for , and bring it back to you in the condition requested . If I don 't terminate you by the warrant 's end , they 'll send another agent , and another , until it 's done . D 'AVIN : Look , you don 't want me here , I don 't want to be here . So , why don 't you just drop me off at the next port and I 'll be on my way ? Do you even know what he did to earn this warrant ? No , but I know him . He 's my brother . D 'AVIN : Someone obviously put a lot of time and money into training her . Don 't you want to know who or why ? KHLYEN : I 'll show you how to use this , shall I ? Each time you receive a red box , you will have a duty to perform . ( MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY ) ( CRAFT RUMBLING ) Oh ! And we have stick . Make it count , Dutch . DUTCH : Just keep it tight and keep him busy . JOHN : That 's what she said . John . Sorry . Monsoon . Monsoon . This is reclamation agent John Jaqobis . I 'm staring at a warrant for 200 crates of primo Qreshi sea salt that magically got up and walked into your hold . So , what say you throttle down and see if we can 't turn that cargo back towards Westerley ? Killjoy , you think you can slow me down back there , huh ? You can take your warrant and shove it where the air ain 't sweet . ( LAUGHING ) JOHN : Charming . Dutch , we 've got ourselves a live one . DUTCH : Damn it , John , are you on a pee break ? Level out - ( THUDDING ) I told you , harpooning a heavy hauler is not like catching satellites , Dutch . We 're bruising . Lucy , engage thrusters . LUCY : Engaging - ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) ( LOUD THUDDING ) ( GRUNTS ) LUCY : Warning . Sharp turn . Ow ! Look , Lucy 's not built for this abuse , nor does she deserve it . LUCY " . Thank you , John . DUTCH : Calm your pants , I 'm almost there . Thirty seconds . I 'll give you 10 . Nine , eight ... ( THUD ) DUTCH : I need more time . ( SIGHS ) Ten seconds for what ? ( ALARM BLARING ) We 're just trying to clear the tab for the damage done saving your ass . Four , three ... Well , where 's the we ? I just see you . Yeah , Dutch had the bright idea to ... Lucy , what the hell was that ? LUCY : I just lost my rear gyroscope . Tight outfit you guys are running here . Dutch , I 've got to cut bait . Lucy can 't take this . Here goes nothing . LUCY : Much better , John . Thank you . ( EXHALES ) You hear that , Killjoy ? That 's the sound of me toasting the windfall that you let me get away with . ( CHUCKLES ) Cheers . DUTCH : Knock , knock . ( DUTCH KNOCKING ) Hear that , genius ? That 's the sound of a Killjoy breaching your ship and laying hands . Cute knife . ( GROANS ) You 've been locked and served . Whoa ! Marry me . Tempting . But let 's turn this baby back to space port and lighten your load . I will say this . You do have some fine taste in gear . JOHN : Dutch , you pushed us too close to the edge on that one . And bribing me with sleazoid 's gear ? That 's not going to make up for it . DUTCH : Copy that . No buying of love . Hello . Peace torch accepted . Hey , I know what you like . You know what I 'd like ? Not to stand in line for my own shower . I know D 'av can 't stay here without papers , but I haven 't had a minute between gigs to talk to him . If you 're not up to it , I 'd be happy to help . No , no , no . He 's my brother , he 's my responsibility . Obviously , he 's a little fragile . Just got to warm him up a little , ease into it , and ... DUTCH : Hey , soldier boy . I said you could stay on my ship one night . It 's been a week . Find another crash pad . So , yeah . Look , Johnny , I 'd love get out of your hair . But you know my situation . No money , no ship , no papers for any world in this system . Then , let me help . Oh , here it comes . We 'll find you work , which means papers for Westerley at least , and money . And all the time in the world to figure out your next steps together . John , I 've been under the boot of the army nine years . Six months stuck in a cage on a fight ship . I 'm not going to get stuck in some mining job or whatever crap-slinging gig you want me tied to . I need to be free . How are you free stuck inside Lucy ? Hey , I 'm not done with you . You know what ? You want me gone ? I 'm gone . Johnny . ( SIGHS ) DUTCH : Whoa ! Illegal , where do you think you 're going ? To drink . A lot . You know you can 't . You want me off , you want me on ... Make up your damn minds . No Papers , back on the ship . Goofy Smile , load the prisoner . Hot Hands , you 're with me . Belay that . Hills , what 's the issue ? It 's your new warrant . And this one ain 't optional . ( SIGHS ) ( SINGING ) Come come , come , uninvited Run , run , run ' till I find you I don 't care which side that you 're fighting Gonna get you gone WOMAN : Your daughter is safe for now , Madame Mayor . She 'll come back to you . If my brother walks . VENA : I 'm so , so sorry . I didn 't mean to cause all this . Please just do what she asks and she won 't hurt me . Hostage situation . She got nabbed last night . Piece of work holding her is named R 'yo . Let me guess . The brother 's the freak on my ship ? Simon Muraayn . Been cooling his jets in Westhole Prison the past three years on attempt theft , Company gear . We bought a hostage exchange warrant with the RAC . You give Simon to his sister , you bring Vena home safe . The Company releasing a convict . Your people aren 't big on that . Out ! Company brings back the Mayor 's baby , Her Worship becomes a loyal friend in a high place . That 's why we need Killjoys . Can 't have Company boots on the ground . If we hire you people , it can 't be traced to us . Sneaky . Don 't sweat the politics . It 's a quick and dirty . Get in , get out , get paid . Secure key . Use it to contact R 'yo to arrange the meet . One , Hills , I don 't work for the Company , I work for the RAC . I pick my own warrants . Two , I really need a break . Look , let 's make this simple . You don 't take the warrant , I charge you for letting an illegal step off your ship . And I burn your docking privileges . I knew I should have never let him on in the first place . Actually , where you 're going , you might want him . Where are you sending us ? Sugar Point ? Great . What 's Sugar Point ? It 's not like I wanted a pint at the Royale and a tumble in the back room , like , ever again . ( GRUNTS ) DUTCH : Don 't blame me . Blame your brother . Excuse me ? So , this R 'yo , she 's ... A warlord . Smuggles in weapons and drugs . Guys , seriously , what 's Sugar Point ? My home . JOHN : Ugh . Oh , God . Company sentenced me to 10 years . I been in solitary for two . Finally , I 'm going home . The first thing you do , Simon , brush your teeth . SIMON : I got a bad gut . The belt 's going to make me ... The belt 's going to make me hurl . Please , chief , maybe , uh ... Maybe you could leave it off ? Nausea . Right . This is a warrant , not a pleasure cruise . Full lockdown . ( SIGHS ) Dutch , he 's going back home to his sister . He 's not a flight risk . I don 't know him , I don 't trust him . Already got one of those running loose on my ship , don 't need another . Holler when we 're ready to bounce . She your partner or your boss ? She 's my partner . Boss . Partner-boss . Whatever , so ? Okay , look . Stuck on the ship 's got me on edge . I know it 's done a number on you guys , too . So , when we 're back I 'll take your advice and find work . Yeah ? Good . Good . And whenever you 're ready to talk about why you 're here or where you 've been ... I 'll find a pretty girl who will listen . Right . Better ? ( EXHALES ) LUCY : Biohazard detected . Maybe you can leave it off , huh ? Just to be safe . You get the mop . KHLYEN : One name . One weapon . From the time you receive the box , you 'll have one week to do as I 've asked . What happens if I don 't ? Very bad things . JOHN : Fueled and ready . What 's the box ? Nothing . Souvenir . Let 's make this warrant . Lucy , take us out . JOHN : Welcome to Sugar Point . D 'AVIN : VVhat the hell happened here ? JOHN : Rebellion . The whole city was one big sweet gas operation . Workers squawk for better conditions , the Company answers with guns , gas wells go up in flames , executives get beheaded , the ushe . But the Company ended the rebellion by bombing the hell out of the place and put the wall up . Now it 's no one in or out . I 've seen bad , but not with people still living there . Not by choice . Anyone that was left was punished by the Company . Forced to work for crap wages . They strip what 's left of anything valuable and ship it out . Or , you know , become a warlord and smuggle contraband in . Like our new friend , R 'yo . Company intel says yellow 's R 'yo 's turf . Dangerous . And the green ? Even worse . Desperate scavengers . Recycling meets gang warfare . The only thing R 'yo and the scavengers hate more than each other is the Company . Nice . So , that 's why they hired you . Neutral party . We close ? Got to come in low ' cause of the smoke . But that tower ? That 's our rendezvous . D 'AVIN : Looks like a plasma cell on the roof . What 's it for ? LUCY : I 'm afraid the more immediate danger is on the ground , south by southwest . ( ALARM BLARING ) Hey , Lucy , what the hell was that ? LUCY : A ground-based hostile is showing unwanted attention . Get down for cover . It 's too tight . Peel starboard and high . We don 't know where the weapon is . John 's good . He can squeeze us through . Do you have a death wish ? Do you ? I don 't . Both of you , shut up . ( ALARM BLARING ) LUCY : I 've lost my rear stabilizers . The short circuit could cascade through my systems . Oh , could it ? John . Emergency power online . Asses in both hands , you guys . We 're coming in hard . ( GRUNTING ) Lucy ? Are you there ? I need a full diagnostic . LUCY : Processing . What are we carrying ? Carrying ? Weapons , shields . We 're sitting ducks here . Whoever shot us down is going to come after us . Yeah , yeah , about that , who did shoot us down ? What do they want ? We 're the ones here to do the exchange . John , why are you opening the cargo door ? I 'm not . Simon . ( SIGHS ) Why would he do that ? We had a gentleman 's agreement . DUTCH : Remind me to shoot one of you geniuses later . John , I know who shot us down . Scavengers . We landed on the wrong side . JOHN : Look , why would he run ? He knows we 're bringing him back to his sister . And may I add , how the hell did he slip the restraints ? JOHN : I ... Just don 't . Gear up . Long guns and survival packs . We 're running down Simon and walking him to the exchange with R 'yo . And then what ? You 're going to need an extraction . I 'm the only one that can get Lucy flying again . So , I have to stay here . You have to take D 'av . No way . He is no Killjoy . No . I need you , John . D 'AVIN : You 're a stationary target with hostiles on all sides . Sitting here alone is suicide . That girl is out there waiting for rescue . So , take D 'av , use his skills . The warrant is all . LUCY : Analyzing cargo hold ion values . ( PRESSING CONSOLE BUTTONS ) Preparing output . Here , I 've tuned this to Lucy 's ion signature . Now , Simon would have picked it up from the flight . But it 's fading fast . You sure you 're good alone ? I got Lucy , don 't I ? Emergency power got her defenses at full . Just ... Nothing can touch me . Go . Go . Go . LUCY " . Are you confused , John ? The defense protocols will deplete my battery . They don 't need to know that , Lucy . Besides , I 'll have you back in shape long before then , sweetheart . But thanks for the vote of confidence . You 're welcome , John . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( DISTANT GUNFIRE ) ( BEEPING ) DUTCH : I 've got Simon 's trail . So , I want to set your mind at ease . Sorry , what ? I told Johnny I 'd get a job when this is over . Good plan . Yeah , well , I lied . You can 't live on Westerley without a Company job . People do . Sure . Warlords in Sugar Point . Scarbacks . Illegal rats in the sewers of Old Town . Outlaws in the Badlands . I 've been doing my research . This way . I 've put 100 outlaws behind bars . You 're no outlaw . All I 'm asking is , when this is over , you drop me off in the Badlands . You never have to see me again . Why are you really here , D 'avin ? What are you running from ? ( DEVICE CHIMING ) R 'yo . Was that your ship the scavs shot down ? Rattled an ovary or two , but nothing I can 't shimmy back into place . Well , you 're in their house now . Too hot for my people . Bring me my brother or I kill the girl . Don 't dawdle . Faster ? Much . DUTCH : Johnny , please tell me something good . Checking Lucy mod by mod , looking for any damage . Is there any sign of scavengers ? DUTCH : Nothing up close and personal yet . Stay safe . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) LUCY : Warning . Five hostiles approaching . Recalculating . Nine hostiles approaching . JOHN : Lucy , put on some tea . We have company . Wish me luck . LUCY : Good luck , John . Clear . This Badlands plan B of yours . You serious ? Uh-huh . You gonna give Johnny a heads up before disappearing from his life this time ? Not if he 's going to make a thing of it . I 'll make a thing of it if you don 't . I 'll think about it . He missed you , you know . ( BEEPING ) Simon 's trail , barely . In there . Hey . Front-door-only access , reinforced walls . Not the easiest place to recon . You want to make some sketches ? Look , you have your specialties , I have mine . Breaching a fortified position with opposed entry takes a little finesse . Scavenger . Cheeky . This ought to be interesting . D 'AVIN : Keep your hands where I can see them , ma 'am . We 're not here for you . We just want the guy who entered . DUTCH : Simon Muraayn . Have you seen him ? Where is he ? Drop the gun and get on your knees . You stuck your head in the wrong door . And now , you 're going to get it blown from here to the Stank Belt . Who are you with ? You with the scavvies ? We 're not with anyone . DUTCH : D 'avin , shut up . We just want Simon . Simon Muraayn . I 've got this . Stop pointing that thing at my mom ! Give him the five count , Dan . Stand down . I don 't want to hurt anyone . One . Two . DUTCH : D 'avin , put your weapon down . Three . Four . I will drop all of you . DUTCH : Down , boy . Reclamation agent . My warrant is not for you . Now , let 's behave ourselves , shall we ? Come on , honey . ( SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ) For the pain . She 's near the end . What 's wrong with her ? Jakk addict . Worst drug in the Quad . R 'yo 's bringing in some bad shit . My warrant is to take Simon to his sister . I know he was here . Why ? SON : After his parents were killed in the bombings , he and R 'yo came to live with us . We 're like family . He just came to say goodbye . Where was he going ? Give us his pack , and we 'll tell you . DUTCH : Do it . ( JOHN EXHALES ) JOHN : That 's a big one . How do you like my odds , Lucy ? LUCY : Calculating odds . JOHN : Yeah , forget it . ( SHRIEKS ) Yeah , you lick that socket , bitches . LUCY : John , every time my defense fields react , it consumes power . A great deal of it . Never come to Sugar Point , man . Never come to Sugar Point . So , a Killjoy badge always get you in the door like that ? Pretty much , The Company may own Westerley but everyone in the Quad respects a RAC warrant . Wait , I thought the RAC was the Company . Nope . But they 're our biggest clients in this system . Quad politics are complicated . One planet , three moons , lots of borders . Warrants served by a neutral party helps keep things clean . So , Killjoys are the Quad 's bagmen . Nice job you got , there . Hey . We 're as powerful as law enforcement , as free as mercenaries , and make Joy you soldier boys only dream of . Meanwhile , you 're on our sofa . JOHN : Dutch , progress report coming at you . Go ahead . Good news , I found the issue . Bad news , ( SIGHS ) we 're shanked . But I can fix it . DUTCH : How long ? Shit . ( WINCES ) How long ? Two hours . I 'll pick you up in two hours . You just say where . Oh , come on , Simon . We can smell you from here . JOHN : Dutch ? She 'll have to get back to you , Johnny . DUTCH : Simon Muraayn ! What up , buddy ? You should have mentioned you wanted a side trip . Could have worked it into the tour . I used to sit here . Mom and Dad , they 'd ... They 'd tend the vegetable garden there . R 'yo would bounce her ball against those stones . We were a family . Whole . I just wanted a good picture in my head . Before R 'yo slits me open from throat to crotch . Look at me . R 'yo moved orbits and tides because she loves you and wants you with her again . She doesn 't care about me . The war killed my parents , but it destroyed my sister . She stopped being happy just playing ball . This became her favorite game . One for every time I messed up . Look , all I ever wanted was to come home . Please , just leave me here . I 'm sorry about what 's between you and your sister . But I still have my warrant . And a girl is going to die if I don 't finish it . I 'm ready . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) Incoming . D 'AVIN : Hold fire . There 's too many . DUTCH : Shit . ( GROANING ) D 'avin ! ( GROANING ) ( MEN DISCUSSING m OTHER LANGUAGE ) YOUNG DUTCH " . Please ! Please ! It 's not my fault . I didn 't pick you , he did . You 're being emotional , little bird . I didn 't want this . That 's why we 're here . You tried to refuse the gift . Sadly , the only way out of here now is if you reach the gift first . It 's him or you . YOUNG DUTCH : Please , Khlyen . I don 't want to kill him . From where I 'm standing , little bird , it doesn 't look like you can . I thought you were special . I thought you wanted to make me proud . I do . Divorce yourself from your feelings . Master your body . Own the pain . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) ( STRUGGLING ) ( GRUNTING ) Welcome back . So , you were right . I totally overstayed my welcome . John ? Are you there ? Signals are out . Needles must have shorted our comms . What are we dealing with ? These guys do more than strip material from the city . They strip people . ( SIMON SPEAKING LOUDLY IN OTHER LANGUAGE ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SIMON SOBBING ) Ugh . Well , there goes your warrant . You have any sharp edges on you ? Or that works . Damn . ( CONTINUES SOBBING ) Dutch , we need a tactical retreat and emergency evac . The mission is over . Quit thinking like a soldier . I decide when the mission 's over . Thanks a lot . Go . ( MEN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ) ( WHEEZING ) DUTCH : It 's okay , Simon . You 're home . You can let go . ( STOPS BREATHING ) I told you , it 's over . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANING ) DUTCH : Nice . You can handle a blade , at least . Yeah , well , I know what end 's pointy . I don 't want to be here when he comes back with reinforcements . ( GROANS ) Gross . I know what this is . Simon did steal something from the Company . And he hid it in there ? You heard him . His sister wants to cut him open . Info bandits sometimes use devices called a smuggler 's nut . Dutch . It 's swallowed , and latches onto the guts . It safely stays there up to six months . And after six months ? It becomes ingrown , causing nausea , bad breath , blue-rot of the organs ... Sound familiar ? Simon was already dying . A-ha ! This is what R 'yo wants . Oh ! Don 't you want to know what 's on this thing ? If she gives us Vena in exchange , that 's all that matters . Yes , sir . LUCY : John . This is your 20-minute warning . Battery reserves have only 20 minutes of power remaining . Wait . Wait . What ? That 's not enough time to fix the inductor . I 'd need a replacement . VVe should have at least an hour . I need an hour to finish . What 's the big power draw ? Enhanced security measures . Since when ? Dutch made the request . She was concerned about forced entry . Forced entry ? VVhat the hell are you talking about ? Dutch never said anything about forced entry . When did this happen ? John , would you like to discuss this later ? We have a development . Damn , I think I 'm about to do something crazy . Are you in ? Always . DUTCH : Looks like the scavs are hunting us to R 'yo 's border . That 's where they 're holding the mayor 's daughter . Past that door , it 's all R 'yo 's territory . Try to keep up . ( HUFFS ) Stop huffing . You 're making me tense . We should be tense . I 'm clocking a thousand ambush points and sniper hides . If R 'yo isn 't happy to see that thing in your pocket , we 're not getting out of here . Fine , it can 't hurt to take a peek . Those are launch codes for a missile . Doesn 't change the warrant . Dutch , you aren 't seriously thinking about giving launch codes to a sociopath . Want me to consider other options ? Give me some . Because leaving here without Vena isn 't one of them . I can get the three of us out of here without giving up the codes . But I need you to follow my lead . Yeah , that 's happening . I 've seen you fight . Hand to hand , close kills , you 're amazing . But that 's not what we need here . Look , you 've been hazing me all day about not being a Killjoy , and you 're right . I 'm not . But maybe that 's a good thing . I 'm a soldier . So , use me . Do you trust me ? Depends . Why did you come to the Quad , D 'avin ? The truth . I 'm looking for someone . A doctor . I need her help . Okay . Now you have my permission to play soldier boy . What do you have in mind ? Cover me . Hey ! Message from R 'yo ! Pissing them off , that 's your plan ? D 'AVIN : You said you trust me . JOHN : I just need two minutes . ( MEN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ) ( REVVING ) ( STRAINING ) LUCY : John , I 've been breached . They took the bait , Lucy . Boot up " fie support centres and use remaining reserves for phase two . LUCY : Doors sealed and locked . Initiating oxygen purge . JOHN : Come to papa . Whatever happens , you grab the hostage . And you 'll be ? Badass . R 'YO : Killjoys . R 'YO : I think you 're missing something . Show us yours , and we 'll show you ours . Bring the girl . ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) R 'YO : Now . Where 's my brother ? My condolences . He didn 't make it . R 'YO : Then neither will you . I hope you 've made your peace with the woods . ( GUN COCKS ) DUTCH : Oh . So , you don 't want this little thing we found inside him ? And that 's supposed to be ... DUTCH : You know what it is . A guarantee of safe passage . Wired to go boom if you tamper with it . I disarm it only when we 're away with the hostage . I don 't negotiate . I don 't bluff . R 'yo . But I do bring backup . You sent an incursion into our land . We demand blood for blood . You come in here and you make demands ? These are outsiders , not my people . Then give us the outsiders . I have business with them . Now , put down your weapons and leave here . Or I will burn you to ash . No , witch . Today we will not run . Ready ? Today you will die . DUTCH : Let 's do it . HEY - ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) Dutch ! Vena ? I 'm getting you out of here . Stay close . I can 't see . Me neither . ( GUNFIRE ) Going down ? ( SCREAMING ) Move . ( SHRIEKS ) How are oxygen levels ? LUCY : Oxygen levels are nearing baseline . All right , Lucy , boot up pre-launch sequence and get me Dutch again . Searching for signal . So , this forced entry Dutch was so concerned about . Was anything stolen ? Were any systems accessed ? After the breach , I 'm missing 10 minutes of memory . So , someone broke into the ship and erased 10 minutes ? I agree , John , it is rather troubling . ( DEVICE HUMMING ) Pre-launch sequence completed . All right , Lucy , start us up . I 'm afraid I can 't find Dutch 's com signal . ( SIGHS ) Well , that 's just perfect . Okay , I 'm gonna get rid of these guys and figure out our next play . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) ( MAN BREATHING HEAVILY ) Oh , crap . ( GRUNTS ) ( SHUDDERS ) ( GRUNTS ) D 'AVIN : Let 's move . Eyes ? DUTCH : Lightshow blinded me . I can see again now , mostly . You honestly memorized the whole layout ? Where the hell did you train ? DUTCH : Let 's just say I was homeschooled . Well , you missed a pretty impressive skills display . You sounded awesome . Where are we going ? Head down in the small of my back , grab my belt . I move , you move . DUTCH : I 'll keep them pinned . What then ? Get to high ground . Wait for Johnny to hit his mark . We didn 't give Johnny a mark . Dad always said he was the smart one . Missed me . ( GRUNTING ) ( LAUGHS ) ( GRUNTS ) LUCY : John , you sound distressed . Can I help ? Big balls . Big target . ( G ROANS ) Hey , can we discuss this like gentlemen ? How about a peace offering ? DUTCH : That was fun . As promised , high ground . How are you for ammo ? Drained . You didn 't wonder why I was throwing finger grenades for the last two floors ? Figured you were a blow-up-shit kind of guy . I 'm out , too . Are we trapped ? I don 't know . Hope you 've got a plan to get us down from here because Mama can 't fly . Lazlo chamber inferno missile . Two hundred click range , burns like the sun . No one should have one of these . That 's what the code is for . No . Did you take us up just to disarm it ? But while we 're up here , we might as well . ( BEEPING ) Keep it holstered , darling . DUTCH : Look who 's talking . That 's some junk you 've got hoisted . R 'YO : Do you know what happened here , little girl ? The Company unleashed a firestorm on us . My parents , my friends . I watched them burn . Then they made the survivors strip our own homes down to dirt . This is payback . An unopened love letter I 'm returning to sender . Right in the heart of Old Town . Where it will hurt the Company most . Too bad we fried your launch codes . I 'll find another way to get them . Get rid of this trash . D 'AVIN : I 'll draw their fire . You make a run for it . Like hell . JOHN : ( ON PA ) Ladies and gentlemen , this is your social director . Those of you not wishing to be blasted into a dewy mist , please step away from your firearms . DUTCH : Johnny . Smart and punctual . Two hours on the dot . JOHN : Would you look at that ? You guys didn 't kill each other after all . Glad you made it to the party . Looks like someone had some fun with his new plasma torch . Let 's get Vena home to Leith . You know , I could strip some really great gear off that missile down there . Yeah , I might have made a few modifications . ( MISSILE BEEPING ) R 'YO : Hurry it up . Shit , it 's going to blow . Clean your weapon . Get back to your chambers . ( SNIFFLES ) It was him or you . Never let it be you . But who was he ? Why him ? Why is a question my little bird must never ask . ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) Open . Vena 's mother says thank you , via a hefty bonus . Warrant fee and tip , minus the RAC 's 10 % skim on all gratuities , and minus the outstanding bill for damages on Qresh . And we 're flush . Finally . So , let me ask you this . Yes , take a week off . You earned it . We all did . Who broke into Lucy ? No one . You increased security . I was paranoid about your brother . Before I got to know him . Dutch . If you have any business that you need squared away ... I 'll square it away . Promise . Good . Not that I 'm complaining , but why has this delicious thing been allowed off-ship without papers ? Temporary permit . Damn . How did you swing that ? Hills owed us , after what we just pulled off . I mean , I don 't like to use the word heroes , but ( WHISPERS ) we 're heroes . We cleaned up a mess they didn 't see coming . We agreed to keep our mouths shut , and bam . One shiny new visitor 's permit for me . One week to find a job or clear out . Hmm . Bar-back position is filled . But I have sexer-rooms for rent upstairs . If you 're willing to work with someone 's legs around your ears . Pree , please . Let 's not lower the Royale 's standards . ( SCOFFS ) Sweetums , this is Westerley . Low is the standard . You 're just in time . VVe 're helping D 'avin decide on a job . Hey , I got it . I got it . Algae farm night watchman . Boom . Actually , John , there 's something I should tell you . I know you want me to stick around and get a regular job . But I 've been considering another option . Killjoy . Killjoy ? Hlsponsoryou . If you pass the tests , you have a berth on Lucy . Why ? Well , you don 't suck at it . And new blood 's good sometimes . Keeps things interesting . Plus , for some dumb reason , Johnny seems to like you . Sort of . Say I was a badass today . I 'm saying you helped us make the warrant , save the girl , and keep a weapon of mass destruction away from a crazy lady . If you want to scrub toilets in the Badlands , fine . But if you want more of that , come be a Killjoy . Killjoy . You 've got a week to think about it . Yes . Enjoy your night , boys . I 've got some business to get squared . Well , all right . The Jaqobis brothers together as Killjoys . That 's awesome . Right ? Yeah . ( GROANING ) Khlyen wants you dead . And I want to know why .

He seems to be eager and supportive . She 'll make a great mom , at least we know that . First thing in the morning you know what you should do ? Send her a hologram .

It was a bit of a shock , but ah , I 'm really happy for you . You look great . And you deserve it . I mean it . I hope it 's a boy if that means anything . Thanks for letting me crash at your place . [ holographic table beeps ] - Well , you 're almost broke . Sleeping on Sarah 's couch . All we 've got is a bike that 'll go 125 and a Sleeper . And you 've got me . A military grade Super in your head , that I 'd like to think is still valuable to you . - We just wait then ? Nothing else we can do ? - You already know what I think . We go back to civilization . And there 's nothing wrong with a day job until we get on our feet . - You want to help me bag groceries ? - Maybe we can get lucky and land a real gig . A Chief Security Officer at a mid-size company . - A security guard ? No way , man , c 'mon . My vote is we stay here . I 'll find a client . - They 're not gonna be able to afford us . The bottom line is I want you to be happy . - Well , if that 's true , we should give this a shot . Got a free place to crash for awhile . - Can you handle being around her ? - Yeah , I 'll figure it out . - Okay . It 's really good hearing what you 're thinking . You should tell me more often . - You know what I 'm thinking right now ? - What 's that ? - Thinking I finally want a dog . - Oh yeah ? - Maybe a golden retriever . - Get one . You should get a dog . But you always struck me as kind of a cat guy . - Fuck you . - Get two dogs . Get five cats . Whatever it takes man .

I 'll do anything that pays - that 's ethical , that helps the cause . I have a degree in social justice . So you come out to the free state to change the world and now you 're on the streets ?

I know a cop inside . No ... [ fingerprint reader beeping ] How do you know it was your Ex ? He 's a monster . And a friend saw him with a Cyborg last week . I was waiting for one to show . I thought Cyborgs were older . The military 's a young man 's game . I 'm thirty-one . How old do you think I am ? Thirty ... two . In the beginning , I was special forces . But now I freelance . They let you keep it ? That 's part of the deal . Clyde 's useless to anyone else . Clyde . I know , I 'm complicated . But you 're the one with a computer in your head . I 'm a hundred percent human ... where it counts anyway . What is he saying about me ? I keep him locked up at night . Hey . Are you coming or not ? So weird . My first cyborg . You had some work done to your eye . It 's an accident , I ... It 's bionic . [ horse chuffs ] Let me see that thing . Haven 't held one of these in years . Let me see your other gun ... [ laughter ] [ blender crushing ice ] Hair of the dog ? It 's just so hot already . It 's a beautiful place . In San Francisco my view was a brick wall . I could open the fridge with my foot from the end of the bed . I can 't imagine having many problems out here . I only have one . I was thinking maybe you could help me figure out my situation . I 've got money . You saw what happened last night . I need help . Maybe you could score both ways . What exactly are you paying me for ? Advise me . Protect me . Why does your Ex want you dead ? I guess he feels like if he can 't have me , no one should . Why not just hire a body guard - save some money . Cause I need someone who can think and negotiate . You want the job or not ? Lisa , look if if this is gonna fly , you 're gonna have to tell me everything . All your dirty laundry - Clyde will find out sooner or later . I have nothing to hide . Why did you two come out here ? So Sterling could start up his new company . He 's developing warfare technologies . Where spirituality meets science that 's how he spins it . When I first met him , he was a shaman . He was a healer . He used his witchcraft to help people . Witchcraft . And he actually thinks the U.S. will buy his snake oil ? Well , not necessarily , but there 's a hundred ninety countries with armed forces . Sterling did RD inside for Newcorp and made millions when Raytheon bought ' em . And this new start up - it 's small , it 's just him . But he 's got financial backers . You divorced ? Not yet . And I never had a pre-nup . You have money though . Well ... Years ago he set up an annuity in my name , and I draw from it . So he pays for you to live here . Look if I was inside , I would sue his ass . But I 'm here , and I need to get creative . My money 's running out , so ... I 'll give you fifteen percent of a deal you strike . Consider this an advance . I 'll do it for twenty . Makes the math easier . Oh my God . Thank you . It 's a holiday right ? It 's Thursday morning . Ah , no . I 'm good . Guess I gotta go to work . If you want to come back tonight just knock on the window twice . [ fingerprint reader beeping , safe opening ] [ electric motorcycle engine ] - So these are the only visuals I have from Newcorp . The rest are classified . Sterling Clark was one of the chief designers of the entomological warfare program in the military . As far as I can tell he 's had a lot of success and has no criminal record . And it seems Lisa Clark has been in his shadow for twenty-two years . [ electric motorcycle engine ] Technically this is all his property . Two thousand acres owned by SDSI . Sterling Defense Solutions Inc . - Just give me five acres by the beach . That 's all I need . - You like her , don 't you . - We had a good time . - You 're unbelievable . - Don 't get all jealous on me now , Hal . - That 's low . Remember Sarah , the woman we came out here for ? - It 's nothing . Don 't get your panties in a bunch . - You know I never wear panties . I 'm shocked you took on this client without consulting me . - C 'mon . What 's he got for security ? - I don 't see anything . And since you jumped into this willy-nilly , I have no due diligence and no signal up here . I count fifteen farm hands , all chipped and trackable . - Load the magnifier . - Nothing in the barn except a couple horses . Those cameras are turned off . - A defense company with no security . - Maybe he doesn 't want his business on tape . Excuse me , sir . Hey , I was hoping to speak to Mr. Clark . Is he home today ? That black stuff - I saw it last night . ( Clyde ) Draw your Sleeper , Dyl . Yeah ... I 'm ah - I 'm new in town . Huhnh ... We have a mutual friend , that 's all . He-he-is - not home now . Okay . Well ... I guess I 'll come back tomorrow , then . You okay ? ... huhnh ... - You think you can trust this woman ? - What 're you talking about ? - I 'm having my doubts . - You haven 't even met her yet . Give her a chance . I 'll take it slow , don 't worry . - My sensors are better than a polygraph . - Oh yeah , what 's she lying about ? - I don 't know yet . But she hasn 't told you everything . - We had one meeting . Of course she hasn 't . - Now you 're going to eject me . Just like you always do . - We 're broke . Twenty grand and a chance for a lot more is worth the risk . - Alright . I 'll dig up all I can find on ' em . The restricted stuff 's harder to get to now . But still we 'll need to walk through a full report before you get in over your head again . - Okay . Tomorrow . [ Clyde ejecting ] Everything checks out . You really don 't need to bring this in until Clyde says to . Hey , are the surgery 's getting any safer these days ? Why ? I don 't know . Something 's off . He 's acting different . Questioning me - N ot just about work either . It 's personal stuff . Look Dyl ... In my experience , any Cyborg malfunctioning in the field is from human error . No offense . This class of Super 's are miracles . They 're better than us . He has no other agenda but you . My advice is to be patient . Work with him . Sorry to bother you . Thanks Dr. P. Not a problem . You think you can make it fly out here ? Got my first gig . Oooh . Get paid in cash . [ safe closing ] [ hologram beeping ] Hey , thanks for the message . Um , are you free tonight ? We should hang out . Bruce is working , so ... you should come to my show tonight . I 'm up for it if you are . You 're not feeling it ? How do you feel ? You love him , right ? I guess I feel normal for once . Kissing cousins ... Third night in a row . Increase your dosage . Write down everything . When you chew it , how you feel . Write down what you remember , what you do . And get back to me . You got it . Much appreciated , Mr. Clark . * " Tear My World " * You tear my world apart , * You tear my world apart . * You tear it ... * Come around back . ... fuck ... What if you bring your cop friend ? I need to win his trust if we want him to settle . First thing we need to do is get you two in a civil conversation . Hey , man . - Hey , so our friend Bruce has left you eleven messages . Turns out he knows your client Lisa . So from now on , we stay connected all the time . - You know I have to unplug , Clyde . - I 'll lurk so you don 't get tired . - That never works . - I can 't miss anything else about your client . You take one step , I help you take the next . Just the man I wanted to see . G 'morning Bruce . Hey I know you 're working for Lisa Clark now . Sterling told me . You know she 's been badgering him for months . Look I need to remind you I 'm not a cop , and you 're not my boss . She 's paying me to look out for her interests . And I 'm asking you as family to play it cool . Get his side of the story first . Of course I will . Why wouldn 't I ? He 's a powerful man . And she 's a little slippery . So don 't come out shooting from the hip . I don 't know what that means . I carry a Sleeper . I can see - make sure he knows that . Look I 'm not trying to tell you how to do your job . I just want to help you out if I can . Let 's put on some skates , Officer . Yep , we 're gone . Keep me in the loop . Everything 's fine like dandelion wine . Isn 't that right sweetie ? Good seeing you , Cuz . - Sterling Clark won a national merit scholarship and studied computer science at Oxford . But when he turned twenty-eight , he joined a commune . Eventually , inevitably , he took it over . He wanted to be in charge of his own little piece of paradise . A place he could experiment with his work in isolation . This was twenty-three years ago exactly when Lisa Jane Hunter joined the tribe . A high school dropout from the San Fernando Valley . They had a passionate love affair . To Sterling they were the next John Yoko or Sid Nancy . Although that didn 't make much sense cause he couldn 't play a lick of guitar . Tuning me out ? - Where 's Sterling ? Is he at his house now ? - He 's untrackable and unchipped . - What money can buy . Must be nice . - Yeah , pretty sure you 're the most broke Yale graduate in history . - Of course I am . - Well , all you can do is keep going down the long black road . Sunshine ahead . - C 'mon don 't start with the Bob Dylan lyrics . - I 've told you this before , it 's Jeff Lynne . Japanese B-Side from ELO 's final record in 2001 . - You were saying - John and Yoko ? - So anyway , his commune supported itself for seven years . That is until a teenage girl was found strangled on Sterling 's property . Desdemona Jones . An original member , Campbell Walter , ended up giving a full confession . He 's in for life without the possibility of parole . - Their own little paradise . So was Lisa going along for the ride ? Or was she actually into all this shit ? - Who knows , but I don 't trust her . Seems like a gold digger . But it would really help if I could process her in person so stop ejecting me . The Campbell Walter case was considered an anomaly . After the fallout , an editorial appeared in the LA Times . It called Sterling and Lisa " a dazzling , progressive couple who charmed this cynic , convincing me their way of life was more viable and fulfilling than mine . " - Holding hands around the bonfire singing Woody Guthrie songs . - Hippie living . They grew their own food , lived off the grid . Psychedelic drugs , orgies . They even experimented with seances and hypnosis . After Campbell Walter went to jail , the commune folded and Sterling took a job with Newcorp . - Where he developed weapons and got rich . - Yeah . Looks like someone 's home today . ( old man 's voice ) libertÃ © , Ã © galitÃ © , fraternitÃ © ... I said only one mouthful . Go on back to work , Grandpa . Huhnh ... ( Clyde ) Stay calm , you got this man . Be direct . So , the Cyborg shows his face . Welcome , Sir . Good afternoon , Mr. Clark . I didn 't know your grandfather was up here with you . Oh , he 's just an old barfly I found . I sobered him up . Gave him a new purpose . That 's nice . I hear you have a new business venture . Yes many exciting possibilities . I don 't mean to pry , it 's just Bruce encouraged me stop by . The cop . You know him ? Oh yes , I 've met Bruce . They 're called peace officers up here by the way . How 's Lisa ? Well your wife is optimistic we can work something out . That 's why I 'm here . She 's my ex-wife . I thought you 'd be smarter . You already believe everything she tells you ? Well she is my client . You Cyborgs are all about the money . No better than attorneys when it comes to the truth . Yeah , you 're right . We 're all liars , thieves . Contract killers . You find Mr. Mohawk swallowing swords at the carnival ? I 'm afraid I have no idea what you 're talking about . Hey , look ... I 'm just a peacemaker too . Getting busy with her at my house , have you ? You 've been spying . ( Clyde ) Cards close to your vest , man . I 've been admiring your little figurines here . This one looks familiar . It passes the time . ( Clyde ) Don 't look at him . Dylan . Dylan , I 'm losing you , man . ... look away ... Draw your sleeper , you hear me ? Nope - stop ! ( Clyde ) Let 's go . Oh my . Lisa 's really sunk her hooks into you , hasn 't she . I 'm on your side too . Give her the divorce . You 've got a Super fused into that skull and you still don 't have a clue , do you . Somebody should really bash those brains in . Put Clyde out of his misery . You couldn 't make it as a Green Beret so you beat your Commanding Master Sergeant to a pulp . Dishonorable discharge . Poor failed , experimental cyborg . Who have you been talking to ? " Divorce " was her idea - not mine . I don 't want to see her face or hear her voice again . And that goes for you too . You 've got a big mouth . Thank you . I have a way with words . And I don 't need a Clyde to help me figure out what to say next . I can do it all by myself . ( Clyde ) We have to get away from him . Turn and go . Keep moving . Watch it - ! Go , go , go - [ sleeper gun blasts ] - Fuck . - You got him . He 's out . You alright there ? Dylan - Grandpa ! - ... that went well . - He disabled me with his eyes . I 've never seen anything like it , Dylan . I was moving in slow motion . - Yeah , same here . This cut 's pretty fucking deep . - They tried to kill you . It 's time to reach out to Bruce . Show him my surveillance . So this one 's for both physical and mental digestion . Everybody take a little sip of perspective . He 'll be waking up soon . We should hook him up . Yeah ? On what charges ? Assault . Attempted murder . Voodoo . A little sip 's not gonna hurt ya . Maybe I should hook you up . Where 's that coming from ! ? I 'm just saying I 'm not the judge , jury and executioner . You saw Clyde 's surveillance . You trespassed on his property . You harassed him . He attacked me . You insulted him ! I told you to play it cool ! Sitting in his chair all smug , playing with his carvings ? ! So he feels threatened ! ? You don 't grasp the government 's role out here . It 's lim-i-ted . Thought Jefferson was about the individual . What about my rights ? Deadly force is justifiable if he thought you were gonna kill him . Look man , you had a fight on his property . He 'll call it self-defense . He 's already tried to kill me . Dylan saw it . You 've been grinding your ax and throwing around accusations since I met you . And now you two are shacking up in his house . You can shut up now . Well that was fast . Easy - - it 's not what you 're thinking . And how would you know what I 'm thinking ! ? I 've got a gig to play . Yep , we 're gone . But first , I 'm gonna check in on Sterling . You know , get his side of the story . G 'night all . Thanks for the drink . ( Clyde ) You actually believe you 'll have a meaningful conversation if you go over there again ? - No , but I-I 'm not just gonna sit here and wait for him to come after us ! - We can give the money back to Lisa . Pick up and leave town . Forget any of this happened . - How is that even an option ? ! There 's no way . - Listen to me ... This is going to end badly . - Look , I was paid well to do a job and I 'm gonna see it through . - This isn 't the military Dylan . It 's not a command . It 's not an order . You 'll get yourself killed . - If we 're smart and shrewd and play this right ? If we 're aggressive , we can - - Then it 's pre-meditated murder so you can get your hands on his money . And I promise every Super in the world sees it the same way . You don 't like what I 'm saying . - No , no . I have the right to defend myself , especially out here . He tried to kill me . - I can 't help you commit felonies and you know that . Bruce will arrest you if anything happens . The play here is to give the money back to Lisa , get on your bike , and let 's go . - I 'm sorry , Clyde . I 'm afraid I can 't do that . - Dylan - [ Clyde ejecting ] He 's not helping us . Nope . So what are we gonna do now ? I guess we 'll just have to do it our ourselves . What ? We need him ! I hired you for a reason . I 'm not sure what else he can do at this point . He already told me all about you two . What does that mean ? The commune and the sex parties . I was young . When I was eighteen , I was still reading comic books . Like you don 't have a past . I wasn 't in a cult . Epicureanism has been around for 2,000 years . It can be a fun way to live . Fun . Yeah ... Was it fun for Desdemona Jones ? You weren 't there . I know . That 's why I 'm asking you . Anything I say won 't matter . You don 't have any context ! Actually , you see I do . I have a pretty good idea of what went on . Get out of my house ! God ! I don 't need any more crazy fucks in my life ! Don 't have time for this shit ! It was Sterling . He got inside Campbell Walter 's head . And convinced him to kill Desdemona . You have to understand what a ... suffocating force he 's been in my life . Aahh .. Easy on me , Aphrodite . Aphrodite ? I like that . Call me that . [ Eerie electronic music , static ] [ Static grows harsher , louder ] He 's outside . Good morning . Hi Lisa , how are you ? Am I interrupting something ? You trying to enjoy a moment of domestic bliss ? What do you want ? After you zapped me , Dylan I awoke to a profound conviction to make things right between us . I had a very nice conversation with Bruce about it . So ... I come in peace . It 's a critical time for us . We 're breaking ground on some new facilities , so I can 't let this distract me any longer . We move forward with the settlement then . Absolutely . Now , as I told you ... Lisa lied to you . We 're divorced . It 's official . She changed her mind . Not content with the annuity , not to mention the gold . She did tell you about the fortune in swiss bullion , am I right ? Oops . I spoke too soon . You 're evil . Can 't confirm or deny that just yet , darling . But I will ask you to withhold judgement . And Dylan ... I will ask you to consider everything I 've done for Lisa for the past twenty years . In Jefferson ... we don 't leech off the system . We are the system . So in terms of resolving our little dispute This triumvirate is our best chance . I 'll ask you to meditate a few days on what you think a fair settlement might look like . Cheers . Perhaps I 'm the one being cheated ? Oh , shut up . Shame doesn 't help . It never does . In three decades most currencies will be irrelevant . As it is written ... " Civilizations crumble but gold remains . " It 's true . So . I will take a moment to propose what I think is fair . And then we 'll get together and hash out an agreement . Until then , be well . He 's right about the divorce - - except he pushed it through . He forged my signatures . I got nothing from him . What about the gold ? He has it ! He 's lying ! If I had the gold , would I have hired you ? Maybe you just wanted me to kill him . He 's in your head . It 's all a bluff . He will kill me before he hands over a penny . If you knew that he was never gonna settle , why would you hire me ? Because I thought Clyde could help us find it . It 's buried on his property somewhere . Forty two million dollars . Three hundred ten ounce bars . A hundred and forty thousand apiece . When we moved here , he tried to hide them from me in these bags of soil . And he caught me opening one . Ruptured my eye . Detached retina . Sterling flew in one of the best cybernetic specialists in the world . It took six months to heal . I wouldn 't speak to him anymore . I locked the guest room . I was afraid he 'd break in and couldn 't sleep . And then I saw him leave with the gold . And I couldn 't follow him , because the old man was waiting for me . I left the next morning , and ... I 've never been back . Two thousand acres is a lot of digging . Well Clyde will help us find it . Right ? One time this photographer in LA hired me for a modeling gig . Sterling threw a hex on him . The poor guy lost his mind . Ow . You alright ? That just needs rum . Feels like ten ounces . Sterling planted it . Do you really think I 'd leave it out here ! ? This is what he 's good at . Pitting people against each other . Getting what he wants . Nothing 's changed . You believe me , right ? Is Clyde gonna help us ? I think he will when this is over . I won 't lie to you . I 'll celebrate the day he dies the rest of my life . You 'll learn to celebrate with me ? You okay ? What ? What - I 'm What ? What are you doing here ? Hunhh , I had to ... I had to do it ... What ? Look at me . What did you do ? I ... He told me to do it . What 's with the carving ? It 's me . It 's me . What the fuck are you doing here , Bruce ? ! I had to do it . He told - No - Nooo ! It 's meee ! It 's meeee ! Nooooo ... It 's me ! Clear the cobwebs - let 's go back to the car . It 's me . Hey , enough of that , alright ? Look at me , Bruce . What happened ? Uh ... we ... went up there ... Sarah ? Where 's Sarah , Bruce ? Where is she ? ... she ... Where is she ! ? ... she ... drowned . What ? She drowned ... Just throw it in the water ! Throw her chip in the water . He cut it out of her ? He bit her ... He bit her so hard . ( Sterling on radio ) Hello ? Bruce ? You there ? Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Tell him mission complete . Bruce ! Mission complete , alright . You threw it in the water . ... mission-complete ... What 's that ? ... threw it in the water ... Excellente . Now come on back up . Over and out . [ engine starts ] No ! Nooo ! Noooooo ! Hey ... ? [ sleeper gun blasts ] Drop it ! Now ! And the other holster , cowboy . Slowly ! If that was my real Grandpa , you 'd be dead already . Where 's Sarah ? Ahh ... I really enjoyed getting to know Sarah . One of my best subjects ... Back up ! She 's untrackable now , but she 's safe . I see you brought Lisa 's little gun with you . Trespassing with a firearm - that 's intent to kill . What do you want ? My gold . I 'm not greedy , just my half . If you want to see Sarah again ? Get Lisa out of my house and bring me one hundred and fifty bars . Pick up your guns and leave . And Dylan - Lisa will kill you . She strangled Desdemona in a fit of jealous rage . I had to work my way into Campbell Walter 's head and get him to confess . I got Lisa out of jail - I gave her a life of wealth and privilege . Even gave her a new eye . And this is how she repays me . One hundred and fifty bars . [ frenzied music , motorcycle engine ] [ blender crushing ice , frenzied music continues ] ... had it all along ... Where is it ? Are you crazy - what are you doing ? ! No , no , no he has Sarah . Tell me where the gold is ! ... he 's lying ... Ask Clyde ! I swear to God , I don 't know ... I don 't know . P-please Dylan , Sterling buried it . I 'm telling you the truth he wants you to kill me ... Ask Clyde .. ! [ knife entering flesh ] You 're just like him . And you want it all to yourself . You 're a fraud . If you kill me you won 't see any of it . [ woman screams , sleeper gun blasts ] [ glass shatters ] - Ah shit ... - Yeah . - What happened ? Why is Lisa on the floor ? - Where is it ? ! - Calm down . What are you looking for ? Money ? - Can 't you see it or scan for it or something ! ? - We 'll need time to shoot a good aerial scan of the property , Dylan . I have Dr. Paul in motion . Stop moving - - Why ? - You 're in shock and you 're losing blood . And the blade 's an inch from your spinal cord . Just calm down , don 't say another word , okay ? ( Dr. Paul ) You 've lost too much blood . You need better wound irrigation a transfusion ... ( Dylan ) There 's no time for that . Tetanus vaccination , intravenous fluids , probably surgery . Am I still bleeding ! ? Not at the moment - no . Please , hurry up doc . Alright . - If there really is forty-two million in gold , Sterling has it . What are we doing ? Talk to me , Boss . You have to communicate . - What about those felonies I 'm committing ? Still got a problem with those ? - My only concern right now is finding Sarah . [ walkie static ] Who 's walkie ? ( Sterling ) Hello Bruce ? Hello ? What gives Bruce , where have you been ? I 'm headed to Lisa 's and wanted you with me . Hopefully they 've killed each other by now . ( Clyde ) There 's someone in there . ( Sterling ) Bruce ? ( Clyde ) Think it 's a person . But untrackable . No , don 't - I can break this . Up-right . Up-down-right-down . - Sarah .. ? ... what happened ... Sarah ! Is it him ? It 's Dylan . Clyde ... ? ! - I 'm getting delta brain waves . It 's like she 's sleepwalking . - Oh my God ... What is this stuff ? ! [ horse whinnies ] Sarah ... Stay with me . Sarah ! - Her vital signs are strong . Your stitches opened up . You 're bleeding again .

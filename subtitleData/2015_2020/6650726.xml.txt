That particular one 's from a reading , January 18th , 2010 . Yes , it is . Did you write this ? Yes . What if I told you that the words and numbers contained in your sermons include sensitive government information that , given the dates you provide , were transmitted solely by satellite through a heavily encrypted format ? The decryption and dissemination of which , other than being scientifically impossible , would surely carry punishments of treason that are so severe , the government probably hasn 't invented them yet . They came from the boy . It 's all from the boy . - Alton Meyer ? - Yes . Okay , well , we knew that . He 's your son ? Adopted . Do you know the birth father ? Yes , I do . Roy Tomlin . So can you tell us how an 8-year-old got this information ? He would have fits . Can you explain that ? He would speak in tongues . Sometimes other languages , sometimes unknown languages . We wrote them down . They became our scripture . These are words of the Lord . Or the federal government . What 's the significance of Friday , March 6th ? We need to know where he is . ( CHUCKLES ) Y 'all have no clue what you 're dealing with , do you ? ELDEN : I prepared a room for him . Alton , it 's wonderful to see you again . Yes , sir . Are those windows blacked out ?

What about the state trooper ? Nothing . I can 't believe the Ranch released this . ... near San Angelo , Texas . That was two nights ago . I don 't think they did .

Windows , light bulbs . Cars would shut down . That kind of thing . It just got worse the older he got , so they just started letting him sleep in the daytime , and he 'd be awake at night . It 's why all our services are at night now . And what 's your job on the Ranch ? Childcare . I help look after all of Brother Calvin 's children . Alton 's been with him over two years now . And the birth mother ? She abandoned him . FREDRICK : Yes , I 'm done . SEVIER : Communing ? That 's what we call it . To be clear , " A visible spectrum of light came from his eyes . " Yes .

Why is this date important ? It 's the day of our judgment . What makes you say that ? I believe it . CAROLINE : It wasn 't images . Not what I remember . It was more ... It was like a feeling . What kind of feeling ? Comfort . And what do you think will happen on Friday , March 6th ? If Alton is with us , we will be saved . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) FEMALE AGENT : Barbara Meyer ?

It 's something he does . Turn on the radio . Scroll through the stations . ( ALTON COPYING MAN ON RADIO SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( LATIN MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ) Be right back . Stay in the van .

Get some rest . Okay . ( DOOR OPENS ) He okay ? He doesn 't look good . He 's sick . He 's getting weaker , but he 'll be okay . Should we do something ? Just stick to the plan and get him there by Friday . Do you think that 's wise ? It 's all we have . This date and place is everything . We take him to a hospital , it 's over . But if it 's between that and him dying ? It 's three days . He 'll make it . I think he 's right . Yeah . I don 't know if there 's a way out of all this for y 'all , but it 's a shame . You would have made a nice family otherwise . ( DOOR CLOSES ) I 'm an electrician . Certified in two states . What do I know about these things ? ( SIGHS ) He wouldn 't have asked you if you couldn 't do it . Sometimes we are asked to do things that are beyond us . ( GUNS COCKING ) Yes ? Are you Sarah Tomlin 's mother ? How could someone cause a satellite to fall out of orbit ? I don 't know . Ask an engineer . Well ... Alton Meyer brought down an Air Force satellite last night . DSP-9712 . - It was tasked with detecting a ... - Nuclear explosion . Yeah . This is the last image sent to us by the satellite . We believe that 's the boy standing at the center of the heat bloom . It 's not exactly a heat bloom , but that 's fine . Well , whatever it is , it set off a satellite whose sole purpose is detecting a nuclear event . No radiation . None . Could a drone be programmed to search for that specific heat signature ? Yeah . We 've got a field office in Mobile you can base your team out of . - What about the interviews ? - You 're done with those . Like it or not , you 're the new resident expert on Alton Meyer . Let 's go . FEMALE NEWSCASTER : Breaking news at this hour . A weather satellite fell from space and crashed near a gas station .

The Canadian company that owns this satellite says the spacecraft suffered mechanical failure ... Can you tell Lucas to pull the van around back ? Okay . It is the first time that debris has fallen in a populated area . Our local affiliate has more from the area hardest hit by this falling debris . Roy asked if you 'd pull the van around back when you 're done . Okay . You 're not from the Ranch ? ( CHUCKLES ) No . No . Then how do you know Roy ? We grew up together . We were real close for a long time , till his parents moved him out to the Ranch , and then we fell off . Until three nights ago , there was a knock at my door , and there 's Roy standing there with Alton . He says that they 're in trouble and they need help . And then Alton sat me down . And he took those goggles off . You know when that boy does that ... That thing with his eyes ... It 's powerful . What do you do in San Angelo ? I 'm a state trooper . SARAH : Alton ? Alton ? Yes ? What happened at the gas station ? Did you mean to do that ? Yes . Why ? They were watching me . Who was watching you , Alton ? The police . Well , how do you know it was the police ? They talk like the police on your radio . What do they say ? They 're looking for me . Here 's a receipt for her car insurance . Isuzu Rodeo , ' 99 . There 's a van in the driveway .

What ? All these places mentioned in the sermons , they don 't matter . ( CLEARS THROAT ) They don 't ? No , he 's just listening to the government talk . He 's just looking for a language to describe a location , and all he heard was coordinates . That 's remarkable . Now they wanna move us to an office in Atlanta . Doesn 't matter . What ? I know where they 're going . Old habits die hard ? You still staying up nights ? What happened to your head , Elden ? MALE NEWSCASTER : ( ON TV ) ... then warming up a bit this afternoon , with a few sunny breaks and diminishing ... MALE ANNOUNCER : So you can go one full year ...

Lucas ? I believe you . Good . ( CHUCKLES ) All right . ( SHOWER RUNNING ) - You all right in there ? - ALTON : Yeah . Roy ? I need to talk to you . Okay . It 's about tomorrow . The world you saw , it didn 't last very long . Seconds . SARAH : And then he got better . Yeah . What are you asking ? What if Alton doesn 't belong with us ? We need to consider that , come tomorrow , he may be gone . ( DOOR OPENS ) ALTON : I 'm out . So you had never seen the sunrise ? No . Did you like it ? What color was it ?

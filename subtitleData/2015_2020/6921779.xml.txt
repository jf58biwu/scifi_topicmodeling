 Harry ? You know , I was actually quite nervous about meeting you , Harry , but I suppose this has broken the ice ? I saw the bracelet on her wrist , Harry . Did she get to you ? Is that it ? Do you get lucky together ? Well , she 's fun , at least . Come on , Rich , I did what you asked , I kept my distance . And yet here you are . Cos I miss you . I miss my brother . Steve won 't be running anything . He 's been reduced to the rank of detective constable with immediate effect . There 's a second bracelet and I know the woman who wears it . She 's stronger than he is . That selfish little bitch just sabotaged your life . - Right now , I don 't care . - But you will . I had two children . Two beautiful baby girls . Dead , because of her . Bastard ! Bastard ! - It 's what you 've always wanted . - Harry , she 'll hurt you . He knows you 're my torch . He knows all the lies you told . - Harry , I ... - She 's right . You got what you want from me . You have to start trusting me . You have to . I know a shortcut . You know , I thought this was a shortcut . Really ? Get your hands up ! Both of you ! Come on , put your hands up ! Get out my way ! - Move ! - I 've danced with the devil . What ? I 'm not scared , pal , but I know you are . Eurgh ! Now , what shall we do with him ? Why did you give me that knife ? To kill Golding , of course . It was what you 'd always wanted . Why would you help me ? Because I 'm your friend . Was . It 's a wonderful feeling , revenge . I 'm sorry you missed out on it . To see what it felt like to be like me for a day . To be corrupt ? To hurt ? To feel trapped and know that you can never escape . I didn 't kill your girls . Yes , you did . I tried to warn you over and over and you wouldn 't listen . As soon as you put this on me , you dug their graves . It was inevitable . Just like it is for Harry . This bracelet will drag him down . - I won 't let it . - How ? If you warn him or tell him the truth ... he will never forgive you . I miss you sometimes . I dream of how we used to be . And then I wake up and I imagine cutting out your eyes . A prototype driverless car ... it was being taken on a public test drive at a launch event yesterday when it went out of control and drove into the water . The future , and it ends up in the Thames . Bloody sat navs . Who 's the deceased ? Mary Wells , the wife of the car 's developer , Davey Wells . And why are we here ? It 's an accident ? The Health and Safety Inspectorate spotted this and called us . The barrier where the car went in could have been weakened beforehand . Or it could be a coincidence . We are leaders in the field of driverless technology . This is a compilation of mobile footage taken at the launch of the driverless car . That 's Davey Wells . Now , who better to join me on this , the first public test drive of our completely autonomous vehicle , than my beautiful wife , Mary ? The car 's complex computer and sensory system allows the car to navigate itself . There he is taking the deceased , Mary Wells , for a joy ride . Any footage of when things start to go wrong ? So , he takes a call at the exact moment the car malfunctions . - Another coincidence ? - Could be . God . Bloody hell ! See if Digital Forensics can trace the call . Will do . So , who is she ? - Who ? What ? - The woman whose perfume you stink of . No idea what you 're on about . Where was Davey Wells when we were fishing his wife out of the dock ? Davey Wells is a wealthy entrepreneur , likes to invest in cutting-edge tech companies . - DI Clayton ? - Yes ? Lakshi Perera . I 'm Mr. Wells ' head of legal . - Is he here ? - I 'm afraid not . He 's not at home , either . Mr. Wells has been through a terrible ordeal . He 's simply in no fit state to answer questions at the moment . I 'm sorry , but you don 't get to decide that . I want a list of all the attendees at the launch - and a schedule for the event . - I 'll see what I can do . I assume you 're carrying out an internal investigation - into the crash . - Of course . We 're working closely with the company that developed the computer systems . We 'll keep you informed of our progress . We 'll do our own investigation , thanks . - What 's the name of the company ? - Spikesy . They 're a tech start-up on Old Street . Police . I 'm DI Clayton . I 'm looking for Rachel Spikes . That 's me . And you are ? - Woody Gilbert . - He works for me . - You 're in charge ? Jeez , I feel old . - You are old . Demon Slayer ? So this is what you call work ? No , it 's just for fun . Is this about the crash ? Yes . When did you last see Davey Wells ? - Last week . - You weren 't at the launch ? Davey never has the techies around when the press are involved . - What went wrong ? - Someone died , that 's what went wrong . Did you know Mary Wells ? No . We knew who she was , of course . Could there have been an error with the programming somewhere ? No way . We spent months testing and retesting everything . We 're going over it all again now . The car system was working perfectly . Look , we 're gutted about Mary , but you need to understand that our careers are stuffed now , too . Could someone have hacked the operating system , caused a malfunction ? - Unlikely . - What are the odds ? About 75,000 to one . That 's a very precise answer . I 'm interested in the science of probability . So , what are the odds you could have made a mistake with the coding ? - Pretty much zero . - Pretty much ? Well , obviously zero probability is statistically impossible . This has just been downloaded from the car 's black box data recorder . Just keep waving and smiling . I am smiling , Davey , but if you keep ordering me about , I 'll shove your mobile down your throat . For God 's sake , not today , the investors are watching . Yeah , yeah , it 's always about the bloody investors . - Trouble in paradise . - It could just be a row . Yeah , but why won 't he speak to us ? Then there 's the issue of the call he received just before the crash . Digital Forensics say it came from an unregistered number , a computer network . It lasted less than a second , so that could have been the trigger for a hack into the car 's operating system . Someone wants Mary Wells dead and they 're at the scene so that they can see when she 's in the car alone . The timing is critical . We need to search Wells ' personal computer . We 'll need a warrant for that , and I 'm not sure we have enough to justify it . We 've got nothing until we talk to Wells . If he doesn 't volunteer himself tomorrow , then we 'll look at a warrant . - Tomorrow ! - We tread carefully . Look into his business dealings . Let 's have some hard evidence to put in front of him when he comes in . OK . No , come on , I 'm leaving . Documents relating to Davey Wells ' business interests . - I 'm not working that case . - You are now . - What , just me ? Where are you going ? - Out . You look amazing . I wake up like this . What are we doing ? Something to take my mind off work . It 's been a frustrating day . I like this new Harry . So does Harry . You shouldn 't let people give you the run-around . Make them do what you want . It 's not how we do it in the force . No , it 's not how they do it . Come on . - Yeah , sorry we couldn 't help you . - Thanks . So , the security man says he 's not at home . Pop in and find out . I don 't have a warrant . You have the bracelet . Don 't be coy . I 'll show you coy . Oi ! Oi ! What are you doing ? Come back ! Argh ! Are you all right there ? Yeah , yeah , I think so . - Who the hell are you ? - DI Clayton . You 're right , Miss Perera , he isn 't in a fit state to be interviewed . You can 't just go breaking into people 's homes . - Actually , the door was open . - Where 's your warrant , DI Clayton ? Why don 't we have that discussion when you 're dressed ? Sort of a cliche , isn 't it ? Cheating on your wife with some woman from the office . - Nice place . - Look , I was going to call you tomorrow . I 've been under pressure . So you 're a hypocrite and a liar ? - Excuse me ? - You wanted Mary dead , didn 't you ? You callous bastard . - Get out of my flat ! - Were you laughing as she drowned ? Why did you go and do that for ? Now I 'm going to have to arrest you for assaulting a police officer . Get dressed . Right , I 'm off to interview Wells . What you got for me ? I 've been through all of Mary 's personal finances and legal files . - She was about to divorce him . - Adultery ? And she was threatening to pull her investment out of Wells ' business . It would have sunk him . - I thought he was loaded . - No , that 's all a front . The wife and the family are propping him up . They put up the capital . It 's all in here . All right , so she dies , his investments remain in place . - Anything else ? - Yeah , can I have a coffee ? - Cheers . - So , why were you at Wells ' place ? Just went round to have a word with him and he assaulted me . Anyway , it 's all good because now we 've got - something interesting on our hands . - What ? You wanted Wells ' laptop , you 've got Wells ' laptop . Shouldn 't this be at Digital Forensics ? No , they 're up to their oxters . - Their what ? - Their oxters . Northern Irish for armpits . I 'll have a look at it while you 're interviewing him if you like . That 'd be great . This is all above board , yeah ? Come talk to me first if you find anything . Why ? Harry ! Shit , sorry , I should have got you a hipster coffee . Piss off . I don 't think we 've got that one in the machine . I should have hit your smug face when I had the chance . Bit of a temper on you . Is that why you killed her ? Morning , Harry . I hope you 're not questioning a suspect in the corridor . Mr. Wells , Jonny Hawthorne , your brief . Please don 't say another word . You 're being released immediately . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , we haven 't even started yet . You entered my client 's property without a warrant . - He assaulted me . - It was self-defence . He believed you to be an intruder - and there 's also the issue of his laptop . - What laptop ? Miss Perera , who I believe was with Mr. Wells at the time , has reported it missing . It 's nothing personal , Harry , just doing my job . Thanks , Jonny . He assaulted me . He did ! And even if he hadn 't , we have a murder case here and he was hiding from us . He wasn 't sick so why is he lying ? Right . And what 's all this about his laptop ? Search me . I will , if it doesn 't find its way back to him . Well ? - I didn 't lie to you . - No , you just didn 't tell me the truth . What if Winter had seen me ? I 'd have taken full responsibility , you know that . - Did you find anything ? - No , I can 't break the encryption . It 's way too sophisticated . Where are you going now ? To see a girl about a dog . There is a good service on all lines . Don 't do it , man . Life 's not so bad . Thanks for the reminder . Why me ? Because you 've got a double first in maths and computer science , you won a European programming competition at the age of 18 . Wow , Grandad can google . Busy saving lives , kid . And I 'm trying to change the world . With driverless cars ? No . Code . Pure code . It ... It 's like poetry . I 've been developing something called Leveller since I was at school cos I want life to be fairer for everyone . - What is it ? - An app . It utilises a new AI compute engine . It runs millions of personal algorithms simultaneously . Stop the tube , I want to get off . It 's like ... having a lawyer , a doctor , a life coach , or a personal trainer in your pocket and available 24 / 7 , yeah ? So you eliminate risk . You can 't ever eliminate risk . That goes against all the laws of probability , but you can even things out . Right , so ... I could have used it to weigh up the risk of giving you Wells ' laptop , - for example ? - Exactly . And what would it have advised me ? It would have said if anyone can break the encryption , Spikesy can . I need it back within an hour so they don 't miss it . Can you do that ? Probably . This station is Moorgate . Harry , you need to hear me out . Please listen . Please ! I 've nothing to say to you . I realise you deserve to know , but let me explain why I didn 't tell you I 'm Isabella 's torch . She 's my best friend . I thought if I gave her the bracelet , it would make her life perfect . But she wouldn 't stop ... the holidays , the perfect man , these lottery wins and these two beautiful little girls . I was standing by the side of a road and the car exploded . It 's just all that luck , win after win , there had to be a payback . She blames me , of course . - She 's right . - Did you warn her ? Yes , of course I did . - I 'm sorry . - Why are you telling me this ? - Why ? - I am so sorry for what I 've done . You can use it for good things . You have a chance , as long as you stay away from Isabella . - You said this was a gift , not a curse . - She has a black heart . She will suck you down with her . She 's ... Believe me , she ... She 's a monster . She 's the monster ? Why do you think nothing bad has happened to you ever since you met her ? Like ... All this luck and , and ... Daisy and Anna are totally fine , it 's because she is the worst luck that could ever happen to you . I promise you , Harry . I promise . Rachel . So ? The car systems were hacked by uploading a Trojan into its ECU . - A what into a what ? - A type of virus into the main computer inside the vehicle . - How ? - Bluetooth . The call to Davey 's mobile must have triggered the upload . And that could only have been done by somebody at the event ? The call could have been triggered from anywhere , but someone must have had eyes on the event in order to know when to pull that trigger . Thanks , I appreciate it . Listen , I need you to send me the relevant files anonymously . Make the e-mail look like a tip-off from a hacker . OK . We have motive . His company was in trouble , his wife was about to pull the plug and now we have firm evidence that he hacked the car . Where 's the evidence from ? - A tip-off . - The source ? - Anonymous . - Anonymous ? And we still have a missing laptop . Is that a coincidence ? It 'd be a hell of a gamble , wouldn 't it , if an officer relied on information from a stolen computer ? Risk destroying the case completely , wouldn 't it ? I would like to re-arrest Davey Wells . - May I ? - No , Harry . I want the information in this anonymous tip-off run by Digital Forensics . We 're going to do this right this time . So , when Forensics check the tip-off , what do they find ? The source is sound , Suri . How can you be sure if it 's anonymous ? Because it 's Rachel Spikes . - The girls ' a bloody genius . - Rachel ? How do you know you can trust her ? Because she 's got as much to lose from the car crash as anyone . - How can you be sure ? - I trust the odds . - All right ? - Yep . - What 's up ? - Nothing . - Goodnight there . - Goodnight . So , this is very nice . A bit unusual . Well ... I had the chance to go home and proof-read a community crime review paper or find out the truth about you . - How do you mean ? - Are you gambling again ? No , I haven 't been near a casino in months . The racetrack , then . I swear . You 're on something and I 'm not the only one to notice . - I 'm worried about you . - Well , there 's no need . Life is good . I met someone . - Really ? - Do you want details ? Absolutely not . What about you ? You seeing anyone ? No , I didn 't get back into the whole dating thing . You want to get yourself back onto the market , mate . You want to get yourself back on a 12-step programme , Harry . Now , I can ask you as a friend or I 'll order you as your boss . - I 'll threaten you if you like . - No ! I 'm just ... OK , thanks . - Erm , I should respond to that . - Sure . I need Leveller ! - We 've got to launch now . - It 's not ready . It doesn 't matter . We 've got to launch now to stay in the game . - It 's not a game to me . You can 't have it . - It is mine ! This office belongs to me ! Leveller belongs to me ! I own you ! - Dig in there . - Thanks . It 's not a commodity . It 's a work of art ! Don 't you give me that pretentious bollocks ! I 'm about to go bankrupt . - Leave her alone ! - It 's all right , Woody . - No , it 's not all right . - Leave her alone . - Get out . - Woody , I can handle this . Get out now , you 're fired ! Woody ! What was all that about ? - I was trying to protect you . - Well , don 't . What ? You may be scared of him , Rachel , but I 'm not . - Wells ! Wells ! - Woody , no ! Do you think I was joking ? Get out ! Aaargh ! Woody ! Woody ! I ... - I told you , he just ran . - Great , thanks . That was Orwell . No sign of Woody at his address . Is this room covered by CCTV ? - No . - Jeez , high-tech . Why would Woody throw Davey Wells out of a window ? What was your relationship with him ? - Me and Woody ? Are you serious ? - Be honest . We had a one-night stand about a year ago after a night on the lash . - It meant nothing . - I think it meant something to him . What 's Leveller ? Something Rachel 's developing . - And you didn 't tell me ? - It was just chat . - Why , are you jealous ? - Ha , yeah , jealous , that 's what I am . Woody Gilbert 's been circulated and flagged . We 're looking into all previous known addresses . - Great . - Have you spoken to his family ? Er , mother hasn 't seen him in months , no siblings . Friends ? As far as we can establish , he doesn 't have any . Suri ... As if anyone tells me anything . So , how 's Woody feeling right now ? Well , distressed . Hurting . Alone . He 'll be trying to block it all out , but he 's an obsessive . OK , so what 's his addiction ? Drink ? Drugs ? Porn ? Gaming . Yeah . He 'll be locked in some virtual reality fantasy world , fighting off armoured goblins . If we had an online ID , we could trace it . Really ? Try Demon Slayer . We 've got a trace on Demon Slayer . City View Hotel , Bethnal Green Station . Great . Suri ? Where 's Suri ? You 'll have to do . Wow , thank you . All right , OK . Thanks . Manager says he 's definitely in , room 119 . Are you sure it 's him ? Apparently he checked in under his own name . This is not a criminal mastermind we 're dealing with . Did your mummy not tell you you 'll go blind ? Ha . Hi , this is Harry Clayton . Please leave a message . Did you really think this would win Rachel round ? I love her . She doesn 't love me . I 'm OK with that . You 're a frustrated and angry young man . You sabotaged the vehicle and murdered Mary Wells . I didn 't do that . - Woody ... - Well , it was an accident , wasn 't it ? You wanted to kill Davey Wells so you tried again . - You pushed him through the window . - He fell ! I was nowhere near him . Two murders . You must really love her . A word , both of you . You again . I 've just got a few more questions . Fire away . I 've seen Davey Wells ' laptop , the one you decrypted for Harry . I 've no idea what you 're on about . A virtual machine was running another operating system and routing all traffic through an anonymous VPN . So ? Hackers do it all the time to hide their identity . Wells wouldn 't have had the skills to do that . Yeah , but Woody did . He must have reverse-engineered the whole thing to make it look like Wells . The syslog was reprogrammed the day after the car crashed . After Harry gave it to you to look at . We 've just been e-mailed CCTV footage of Wells ' death . - I thought there wasn 't a camera . - It 's from an adjacent office . It was knocked in the wrong direction . It was pointing through the window . It 's quite a coincidence . - So , the light blows , he falls back . - So , Woody was nowhere near him . It was just an accident . Just pure bad luck . What time was that recorded ? He fell at exactly 9 : 31 . Sorry . Can we see that again , please ? Just in ... You have one new message . Harry , meet me at Spikesy 's as soon as you can . I may have evidence that Rachel tampered with the data . I 'm driving there now . OK , Steve , we can release Woody Gilbert now . Suri ? - Hello ? - S ... Suri ! - Hello ? - Suri , you OK ? - I 'm fine . - Hold up . - Has she gone ? - Who gone ? It was her that planted the evidence for the hack . - How do you know that ? - I copied the contents of Wells ' computer . - The data was doctored . - You did what ? Well , you were so obsessed with her , convinced she was in the clear , someone had to cover your arse . If Winter found out that you had stolen evidence ... You do it , stuff like that all the time . Yeah , but I do it so you don 't have to . God ... - Y-You don 't want to turn into me . - Why not ? That is a question you can only answer with a very big drink in your hand . - I 'm sorry . - Apology accepted . She 's wiped every computer . Yeah , but I 've still got Davey Wells ' laptop . Where are you , Rachel ? Daisy ? Dad , you 're OK ! You 're walking . I know , I know , I know , I 'm all right . - I was so worried about you . - I 'm sure you were . I 'm fine . Here , do us a favour . Erm ... There 's a machine up there . Go and get me a black coffee , please . We 'll catch up , OK ? You look a mess . - Did you tell Daisy what happened ? - Not all the details . Great , I 'll tell her Jonny tried to kill me . Don 't you bloody dare ! - Where are you going to live ? - I 'll be fine . Listen , thanks for coming . I 'm sorry , I 've got to dash . This case is ... Yeah . - What ? - What ? - You know something ? - No . Anna ... I ... I can 't . Listen , someone just tried to kill me and they 're still out there . OK , I know Jonny 's been working with Lakshi Perera . Yeah , Wells ' head of legal . So she said that Rachel Spikes came to see her yesterday . Apparently , Rachel 's locked into this contract where Wells owned all her intellectual property for the next 30 years . Yeah , I know , I know Wells owned Spikesy Business . No , it 's more than that . Basically , he owned Rachel Spikes herself , including every brilliant idea she might come up with . So why is she going to see Lakshi Perera ? Apparently she thought his death would get her out of the contract . And did it ? No , of course not . The contract 's with the company , not with the individual . - She 's trapped . - Yeah . Come on , slowcoach . Thank you . You 're welcome . Hi . - Harry ! - What ? It 's nothing . I 'll rest when we catch her . What have we got ? She 's vanished into thin air . Chances are she 's trying to flee the country . Two things ... this just came in from Lakshi Perera . It 's the attendees and the schedule from the car launch . Better late than never . And the council got back and confirmed that the barrier was broken prior to the crash taking place . So it was just bad luck . Leveller is her only love . It 's her baby . Now she knows that Davey Wells ' death makes no difference to her situation , she 's going to want to ... hide it away forever , destroy it . We find Leveller , we find her . Suri . - And how about me ? - We 're good . Cos I can do more than just trawl paperwork . - Course you can . - We 're good . I took the demotion , I took the stick , I kept my head down , did what I was asked . - You want to be transferred ? - I 'm not trusted . I think a fresh start would be best for everyone . She used you , Woody . She tried to blame you . She said you created this Trojan . Where 's Leveller ? On a hard drive , locked away somewhere so Wells could never get it . Any idea where she hid ? A deposit box somewhere . Is there anything else you want to tell us ? The coding in this Trojan ... parts of it are the same as Leveller . See , code is like handwriting , everyone has their own style . So , if we find Leveller , we 'll have the evidence to connect Rachel to the car hack ? An expert could see the same person created both . Did she say anything else about the deposit box ? Nothing . Leveller 's her baby . She 'd go and check on it from time to time , pop out at lunch just to make sure it was safe . She 's not going to share something like that with me , is she ? How many deposit boxes do you think there are in London ? Well , Woody said she 'd check on Leveller at lunch time so that 's an hour ... 30 minutes each way . Less than that . She 'll have spent ten minutes in there , minimum . Yeah , good . So , 25 minutes each way , but by taxi or on foot ? I bet she walked . Yeah , so google the nearest one , see what comes up . Yeah , right . How lucky do you think we are ? Right , the nearest vault is at 140 Baker 's Row . She 's definitely in there . Security have confirmed it . - I can 't believe it . - Check round the back , I don 't want her to slip out through any side entrance . Going somewhere ? I weighed up the odds on how best to do the right thing . I 've seen the schedule . The event was running behind time . I think the car was supposed to be empty when you triggered the hack . You didn 't mean to kill anyone , did you ? I just wanted to ruin his business . Because of Leveller ? Wells was going to sell it to anyone . It was meant to change the world . I had to do something . - You understand that , don 't you , Harry ? - I do . - Is it in there ? - Yeah . You know by now , outside will be swarming with cops . I really have run out of options , haven 't I ? Well ... It 's amazing what you can buy on the dark web . You can get Semtex delivered to your door within 24 hours . I 'm blowing myself up and I 'm taking Leveller with me . I 'm not leaving you . In this confined space , the charge from this explosive will destroy everything in here . Show me Leveller . No . What if I told you I could open that safe ? - You don 't know the combination . - I 'll guess . This is a six-figure number . The odds on guessing it first time are 1,890,787,499 to one . If I get it right , you let me see it . If I don 't , we 'll die here together . - You 're insane . - No . I 'm just a gambling addict who needs to get back on the 12-step programme . Fine . One chance . One chance . That 's completely impossible . How did you do that ? Statistically , nothing is ever completely impossible , remember ? No ! No , no ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Go . Go over there . Go . Rachel Spikes , I 'm arresting you for the murder of Mary Wells . You don 't have to say anything ... What do you want ? The flat burned down ... and I 'm going out tonight , I 've no other clothes , and you 're my size . Right . Don 't touch my pants . You 're so quiet . Don 't you like jazz ? - You know that guy whose house we went to ? - Who ? Davey Wells , the one I told you about . Yes , the one that was messing you around . - He died in an accident . - Did he ? He fell out of a window . That 's unfortunate . It happened about the same time you sent me that text . Well , I send you lots of texts . No , the one where you asked me if I wanted to be wicked with you . Yes . Your answer was rather boring , I recall . So , what did you get up to ? Very wicked things . It turns out he was innocent . He didn 't kill anyone . So , he 's innocent . Purer than the driven snow . - Not quite . - No . So , who cares ? Classy , beautiful ... what have you possibly got to complain about ? I 'm not sure . - Do I kill people ? - Do you ? Whoa , whoa , Steve ! Is that a magic bracelet ? I don 't believe in addiction . It 's a choice . We have no time so go , now .

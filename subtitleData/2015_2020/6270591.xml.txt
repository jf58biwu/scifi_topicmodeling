 95 ... 96 ... 97 ... - 98 ... - You 're peering , Dash ! - That 's not true ! - 99 ... We are three . Agatha , my twin brother Arthur ... and then there 's me ... Dash . We spent the first nine years of life in a vegetative state . - Upholstered drugs . - Children ! But a group of scientists saved us with an experimental therapy . It has given us our mind , and at least for a while ' ... our childhood . But this gave us something else . A gift . Precognitive abilities . Blind study . Tuesday 2 October . Subjects under study : Dashiell , Arthur and Agatha . Well , children . - Torlaksen . - Red . 27 . - Sanchez . - Yellow . 81 . Hineman . - Blue . - 66 . We could see certain things . Little things that were going to happen around us . But one in particular stood out . Unbelievable . - There you have another deck ? - Oh no ! I beg you ! No ! Down on my knees ! Let 's see your beautiful smile ... - Piece of shit ! - It 's happening again ! Sedateli ! Help me , help me ! - Can you see ? - Let 's see your pretty smile , you piece of shit ! See what , honey ? Murder . The scientists realized that we could see every murder within 150 kilometers ... Days before it happened . And that was the last thing I saw of the outside world . The government took away . They gave us a code name : the precognitive , and they connected the brain to machines . They called it " program Precrimine " . So hundreds of murderers were captured , and saved thousands of lives . But this cost us our very lives . We could not grow like everyone else . We could not have memories , in addition to the visions that we were . But then it all end . The Precrimini was abolished . We were sent to a secret place remaining hidden from the rest of the world . But I could not hide forever . So I made the decision to return . Now I have been here for six months , alone . I still see things before they happen . - Good morning , sir , better if it changes . - Thing ? And this has advantages . We lived in the era of progress . - With his agents Precrimine ... - But this makes it difficult to adapt . Especially when technically ... it does not exist . If you 're wondering , my future is the only thing that I can not see . You look a bit ' stressed out , man . Why not try the baked goods Harts ? But the future of the other haunts me still . I keep this quadernino to write down all the details . But I see nothing but brief moments . It is not enough for a complete image . Since returning , here you were murdered 103 people . Men , women , children . I never managed to arrive on time for any of them ... until today . Today will be different . No no no ! Ascoltiamoci a little ' music to concentrate . They have already questioned all over the floor , but the neighbors have not heard anything , and do not ask me even cameras in the hallways . Let me guess ... out of service ? Exactly , so no facial recognition and no ocular identification . What do we owe the honor , V ? - It was not a case of Blake ? - I needed a little ' air . You 're really lucky ! The murderess has left the window open . What is the center Open Vistas ? A sort of clinic for neurological rehabilitation . Our victim worked there as a nurse , we 're checking . Do me a bit ' of space . Let 's figure it out . The victim returns home ... He closes the door . Try to hang your coat , but falls to the ground . E ' in a hurry . It is packing . But then someone breaks down the door to kick . There are signs of a struggle . She confronts him ... he pushes it to the ground . He tries to defend itself . He has green light to run away , but decides to stay . He tries to attack him in turn . Did he leave her . Why ? Our victim was protecting someone . But you know that once prevented these things before they happened ? Unfortunately , there is no longer Precrimine long before we came along , beautiful . Now our job is to clean up messes like this . But who was protecting ? What ? Do you think that the murderess has made a sandwich ? No , unless you go to kindergarten yet . Nancy , let me see infrared . What ? We identified . The victim was his aunt . She was holding her . Call me immediately when you found her parents . Certainly , detective . When we were released , we promised that we would not interfere with them . I was cautious . In your opinion it is " cautious " running toward the scene of the crime as a hero ? - You think I do not see it , Dash ? - I do not want to know what you see , Agatha . If you talk to the police ... it will be a mistake . You should have seen . That child ... We will have had the age that we had when we started it all is . So it comes to this ? You think you can undo the past interfering with the future ? And if I had arrived on time ? What would you have done ? He would have faced the murderess , fought against him , and told the police who you are ? - What are you ? - Do you know how many things I see out here . - If you could get once in time ... - But you can not . You know that . Your gift is not complete without your brother . - There are people who will use , Dash . - Will not let him . You 're so obsessed with the future of others that you forget ... that the only future that you can not see is yours . - But I see it and believe you ... - Stop it ! Back home ! And ' this your place . - The detective from which it will use as you go ... - Now hang up . Has anyone ever heard of precog ? And ' the diminutive of precognitive . Their power is started when they were just children . Even more young than you are now . Their names and their faces remained secret to the public , but the police used what they saw , their visions , to prevent bad things from happening . Hey , stop there ! Keep your hands in view . I have a thing for her . Slowly . 1313 . Where did you find him ? - I have to go . I have to go ! - Who are you ? It must take ! It ' s just temporary , I 'm sorry . But what ... ? You should not be around to do the fines Maglev , Vega ? I knew this was your case , Blake . I solve it for you , so you can take the credit and it is promoted as the last time . This is called delegate . And ' a task to lieutenants . - Me the sign . - You are right . Because you will be a good lieutenant . I will be when I become your captain . But for this I need you , Vega . Because , you see , I have a track . Apparently , the Open Vistas is not a rehabilitation clinic normal . They specialize in the syndrome of Marks . Encephalitis that is ex-prisoners of Precrimine . Burns halo . You mean my victim was a nurse in a place full of murderers ? You mean " my " victim . And technically it came to future murderers . They were released after the abolition of Precrimine . This does not make them innocent . They would become killers . The problem is ... which of them we 're looking for ? We have neither DNA nor a face to look for . And if we had we ? A weird guy gave me this just now and then if it is made off . A kind of informer ? - We should look for it in the system . - We should not , but I should . - The tip is mine . - But the case is mine . There is a match . Sahm Adrangi . A drug addict who was of Clarity . Precrimine not until the beak for the future murder of a DEA agent . And look how he wanted to do . Throwing it out the window . At least it has a trademark . The detection eye , the last place is a steel mill has been converted . Vega ... I wish I could come , too . Move away . Move away . Sahm Adrangi ! Do not move . Throw that gun ! Peekaboo , asshole . Vega , removed . Admit it , Will , you do not know how to close the cases . You ... You do not know anything . - Move away . - What are you saying ? - No no ! - Move away . I would have ended differently , but ... so it 's OK . Hey , but what a great job ! But I thought you wanted to bring him back alive . Now you 've got something to say , huh ? It committed suicide . He did not want to talk . I think he had an accomplice . And that your informant ? - Did you see it well ? - He was camouflaged . He hits me with this , and then he ran away . An enzyme that causes temporary paralysis . He disguises his face , sending the muscles to mush . Apparently , it also works on the legs . Whoever it is , he has managed to avoid all the surveillance cameras . But look what I discovered from a selfie-drone . - Nice picture . - And that 's not all . I looked for the DNA found on his things . - No criminal record ? - Nothing previous . - This guy is a ghost . - Already , with an imagination really diverted . Maybe not . Look here . In this note we are drawn dozens of murders . I bet they 're all real crimes . Maybe you came into your database . Nobody comes into my database . Okay , well escludiamolo . A kind of observer . One that grows without human interaction . At the edge , watching the world around him . We check the video at the scene . Immediately . Did you recognize anyone ? No . Nada . Whoever this your friend , do not you want to find . I would say that I have to go back to that place . Vega ? Come with me ? No , you go ' well , Blake . I have to make the fines . You do go alone ? This call delegate . Okay , the next Karaoke night you will tell me what 's in your midst . The observer Search this face . Last location . Bingo ! Here ! A cheeseburger and a hot dog at the table number 5 . Fish cakes ! I can ? - No , stay , I like the company . - No , well , I was going to ... Can you believe that once hurt it ? Thank the genetic revolution ! It makes you always be hungry watching women die ? Thing ? The one tip that you gave me . It ' a friend of yours ? The murderess ? Did you get it ? In a sense . I did not know where I would have to send the medal . For me ? No thanks . Let 's skip the part where you play dumb and you threaten to take you inside . Inside ? In where ? No thanks , I 'm fine here . These drawings show that you were present in a dozen murders . - It can not be just bad luck . - Look , you do not understand . I am alone ... - A sentry ? - Yes ! Yes ! No ! I mean , well ... I see them and that 's it . So you enjoy watching ! I like to watch ? No ! - I need air , I have to ... - Sit ! Breathe , okay ? I understand . Not a murderess , I recognize it when I see one . Are you serious ? You came to me . But why ? You 're in deep trouble ? May I help you . - Just tell me what happens . - No not now . - Not now , what ? - Please let me ... Can you see ? See what ? Murder . Someone call an ambulance ! The ambulance is coming . No , I must go . Okay , okay , okay ! Are you one of them . Please ! Of course , we were in any archive . You 're one of the twins . Dash . They canceled all our data after the end of Precrimine , and then they moved away . You can see ... They have used ... - But why did you come back ? - You arresterai ? Should not you be the one to tell me ? It would make things more simple . I can not see my future , but that of others . But first , in the bar ... - You saw a murder , right ? - I can not do . - Who is the victim ? Give me a name . - I do not know , please ! Do not lie to me , to Precrimine knew the names . We were a group mind at that time , all tied together . Now it 's different . The gift of Agatha is strong , but I and Arthur ... we like ... one mind , but split into two . And ' he who knows the names . I only see what happens . And where is it ? - Where 's Arthur ? - I have to leave . You have my drawings , and inside you 'll find the murders that the police must solve . I can take no more to clean up messes . I can not help you . I told you . I tried last time and ... I have not seen enough . Let me to help you . You do not want to halt at least one ? Is there a reason why you found me . I can not continue to get to a step . Me neither . Since the end of Precrimine ... we allowed ... - That the crime would increase the stars . - What ? ... As mayor . My system Hawkeye will change everything . Peter Van Eyck was deputy head of the Precrimine . He has necessarily enemies . If someone is angry with his wife , maybe it 's for revenge . Wait , he worked at Precrimine ? Relax . The three of you were isolated , no ? No one has ever seen . So ... what ? How we save ? Let me talk to Van Eyck . If you hear anything , let me know . We can only warn them ? Yeah , right , we tell him that you are a precog and you had a vision , great idea . - No ! - Look , this is now an investigation . You told us who is the victim , now we have to figure out who wants to kill her . Forgive the wait , the fault of too many commitments . Peter Van Eyck . My wife , Olivia . And he 's Jack . It ' been a long day for him . You know , you have a cold . Thanks for the warning . Honey , you 're far away , you have to be in force for tomorrow 's meeting . Tomorrow , the National Mall ? - It should not go there . - These two are starting to like it , Peter . But Jack is getting late . The staff will understand . - Can you say hello ? - Hello . Hello . So , what can I do for you , detective ? Detective . As I said to his assistant , we are following a track on the meeting tomorrow . He received threats recently ? Not that I know of . But I 'm not surprised , I 've been in law enforcement for 10 years . Yes . The Precrimine was one of the reasons I wanted to become a policeman . Too bad it 's over before I left the academy . It was a good program , despite the flaws . Now we must move forward . - My new system . - Hawk eye ? Yes , his posters are everywhere . Environmental surveillance , search algorithms ... a police predictive working on real data , not on ... paranormal instincts of some genetically modified freaks . - Monsters ? - So , returning to the threats . My confidence has controlled cyber-traffic throughout the country . Ashley will show you everything . - This way . - Thank you , detective . - Lose bad elections . - Excuse me ? Anything . Expect that far ? No . We keep a constant passive search on social networks , video surveillance , and also on certain purchases . All these incidents have been checked and neglected . Stop ! Open Vistas . And he . Adrangi . Do you know him ? We 've already met . The system has detected that did a search on the net to inquire about the security for the meeting tomorrow , but ... he rejected as a threat . Go ahead alone . He rejected ? Why ? It ' a murderess . Why Adrangi killed himself three hours before they did the research . Nursing Open Vistas . All those in care are ex-convicts as murderers from Precrimine . One of them , obviously has not learned the lesson . I remember them . James Lands . Alice Sincher . Emil O 'Cartney . Hey . Earth Dash . I was the one to do that to him . No , you have prevented the killing . It 's not your fault that the prison has fried your brain . May I help you ? Maybe . He knew the man in this bed , Mr. Adrangi ? Only a few weeks ago . Since they have moved my father in this department . Why ? He threw a woman out the window and then committed suicide . Okay . Let 's now talk just me . It ' ... terrible ! Maybe it has not only designed this murder , and must have helped him . - It 's his ? - I think yes . - And his father could access it ? - I guess yes . E ' on this device that made the research of Van Eyck . - Van Eyck ? - Former deputy head of Precrimine , He arrested his father , right ? For something that did not . Perhaps because he could not . Precog I have seen him kill his wife . My mother . But he loved her above all else . The police took him away anyway . They put the halo . When Precrimine closed and brought him up ... she died of grief . And he ... had the brain so injured from captivity that he had forgotten his name . And ' why do you drink ? How , pray ? It means that it must have been difficult for her . Can we see it ? Here . - And ' why do you drink ? - You said to warn you if I saw something . You know that means " quietly " ? Ask what you Adrangi on , but do not expect much . These days , my father only interested in his hobby . Have visits , dad . Come down . Take it easy , okay ? Sure . So , what do you see ? And ' This is the kind of ... - You got that , right ? - I did not see his face . These people are here to talk to you . Olivia Van Eyck . - Van Eyck ? - You should not be there . I do not know that bird . - You do not have to stay there . - The spade of Van Dam , on the other hand ... endemic in Madagascar . It 's not a bird . And ' the wife of a politician . - But she knows it . - Really , you should not be ... For real ? You 've said " quietly . " Enough ? We have just started , in reality . We found the Hall of Adrangi beside his bed , He has done research on the safety measures of Van Eyck . I guess that does not know anything , right ? Searches ? No . My work is here . The work of a lifetime . - Pigeons ? - Pigeons migration . The species is extinct 150 years ago . But my father made them return . He was a brilliant man . I still have my moments , dear . On good days . How does it do ? Neural interface . A wireless signal to an implant inserted into the skull . Easy on him . What 's wrong with that ? He , not the one . Plasmosis avian Extremely lethal . Some things should remain pitiful extinct . But some of him remained . The Precrimine took away everything , and gives the blame to Van Eyck . - Do not you ? - Thing ? Why kill them in tomorrow ? - What the hell ... - It ' s absurd ! I think she and the Adrangi have designed together . A nurse found out and have thrown out the window ! - I do not know what you 're talking . - Of course not . I miss . - Is about to jump . - I 've always been a ... Dash ! Not now ! - You have to stop it . - Arrest me ? - As ? - No ! - Hey ! - Pope ! Stop ! Thing ? Sorry . I messed up ? What makes you think that ? Still no results , but I 'll let you know if you see Ratlidge . But where did you find this track ? There 's nothing in the system . A new informant with whom I am working . It has good instincts . It just needs to work a little ' socialization . And keep it to yourself , okay ? You mean , do not tell Blake ? Sooner or later , you will have to tell me everything . If you want details , please ask to Blake , he is good at telling stories about himself . We interrupt something ? I have to go . And ' your boyfriend ? No , he 's Dash . A colleague of mine . We consult on a case . To the police . This time . Sure . A colleague . When I was your age ... we had a thing called Tinder . - Mom ! - What ? I ' so I knew your father . You can not spend your life at the center , and then it 's nice . Stay for dinner ? Yes . We order Chinese . - Seriously ? - No not at all . I cook . We relish a nice homemade dinner . Who wants to eat Chinese ? Did you find the private corner of my mother . He loves old stuff . Produced by David Bowie , Mick Ronson on the piano . That day Lou Reed had a cold . On the island we had a lot of free time . Maybe you should live with my mother . Sarcasm . Leave it . Ago ' as if I were at home . It must be nice ... having a family . It would be better with a little ' more space , but yes ... sometimes it 's nice . Your son seems to be a good boy . Rico ? No ... No , it 's my son . It ' s my little brother . Mom was 60 years old and did not use precautions . He thought he had a free bed and then I 'm back . You know ... the salary of a policeman ... You 've become a cop for Precrimini . I became a cop because ... I lost my father to 6 years ... They were shot by a machine ... He was protecting me . So if ... the Precrimini is an interesting concept , is not it ? We never had much of a choice . Doctors there found somewhere when you were a child , right ? They always said you three you volunteered ... It is not so ? At 9 years old have begun to submit to testing . At 14 , they were bound and placed in the bath of milk . And ' the last thing I remember the last 10 years ... apart from ... what we saw . I guess that explains my abilities to socialize . Have you heard ... Excuse me , do not ... Everything is alright . Even Arthur teased me . I told me I have an awkward side . Well , people are not so complicated ... just make him think that you are like them and open . However , what happened ? Arthur . One day we came home and he was not there ... Agatha said that someone had abducted ... He had predicted . But then , a month ago I heard ... his presence . It ' still alive ... and he needed my help . Well , he 's not the only one at the time . The meeting is between 12 hours and ... we have not even a track . At least Precrimini can entrarti in the head ... see what you see . Maybe we can still . Wally took care of us at Precrimini , was the only real person that we saw ... later he helped to settle into the new house . A kennel ! They have followed ? Move , revenue ... even the roads have eyes . Good heavens ! Is it really you ? You 're so grown up ... so human . How long have you returned ? Why did not you call first ? I kept a low profile ... Tell me all about your brother , Agatha ... You can chat afterwards ? The usual police . Always in a hurry ! I know my rights , however . If the contact lenses are recorded . Work to murder ... and illegally use a psychic to prevent a murder , we are already all outlaws . She 's Vega , is ... a colleague . Can you help us ? They said you were that weak . Agatha saw the big picture , Arthur names . You just fragmented images ... little things that others have missed . Escape ? They covered everything when the program flaws ... They wanted so much that their precog were perfect ... who have never been able to accept a small , uncomfortable truth . What truth ? Why Precrimine worked , everyone had to believe that the murders in our visions were dictated by fate ... and that no one could change the future . The secret was that not even the 3 precog saw the future in the same way . - Visions abnormal . - The stored them as minority reports . Yes , which means that the future is not written in stone . A neural interface homemade ... similar to the one we used in the temple , only ... not so refined . Then ... will do a little ' bad ? Maybe a lot . Okay . Here comes the sting . - What is happening ? - Oh no . No no no ... It is weaker than I thought . Is suffering , you have to stop it . Do not stop it . It 's fine , he 's fine . Look ... What is it ? The murder weapon . Hey . You 've been good . The pigeon sick . And ' so that Ratlidge plans to assassinate Van Eyck . But it 's his wife who dies instead . Collateral damage . Data analysis center . Found something on Mason Ratlidge ? Well , it 's a bit ' fetched . I 'm okay with everything . One document shows that his family had a property in Virginia , an old tobacco cultivation , closed when it passed the amendment . You should not be there . Thank you , but for the moment does not bother me a bit ' of bird poop . You have the right to remain silent . You have the right to an attorney , if you do not you can afford one , - One will be assigned ... - No . - Do you understand your rights ? - It happens anyway . - As ? - I see him again . It can not be . Get up ! Get up ! Who else works ? Someone to Open Vistas , who has access to your birds ? - Come on , give me the name . - Or what ? I arresterai ? I spent eight years in a nightmare , you have no idea what it is ? I yes . Sometimes I wake up and think I 'm still there . As if everyone in the world had a future ... except me . They took everything . My wife ... his mother . She ... his daughter . He 's doing it for him . She and Adrangi have designed together . And now , the former MVP dell ' 87esimo Superbowl . for Washington Red Clouds ... and future mayor of this beautiful city ... Peter Van Eyck . Hey ! A woman will die soon if we do not stop . Where it is placed ? I told you , I do not see enough without the other . You have to try . Think . Up there . Come on , we gotta go . Force ! But thanks to loving parents ... and two older brothers thanks to which " cures " - I turned pro football . - Force Clouds ! I got ... Yes , strength Clouds ! - We have come a long way together . - Make way , make way ! And I know that despite ... Make way ! Please ! To make sure that this city ... become the city of the future . God bless you . Do not do it ! Oh God ! Permission ! You need to leave . I want to thank the brave police officers today foiled an attempt on my life . A threat that would never come , if there was a system Hawkeye . We want to know more sull 'attentatore . I 'll let details ... Thank you for having closed my case without killing anyone . The night is still young . You know , I tracked down your informant . You did it on your own ? No . I was not alone . We did it , Blake . You and me alone . To give the police the resources and tools they need ... to keep us safe . Okay , of ' cheese . Cheese . All done ? Now you are a person , you 're in the system . Even with an embarrassing past fake social networks . Thank you . A woman would die without you , Dash . You 've stopped one . You would have done the same if I was the monster genetically modified . Sarcasm . And next ? You know where to find me . Hey , wait , I almost forgot ... What is it ? A collector 's item , the playlist of my mom . Since you like oldies . He will say yes to . UNKNOWN NUMBER Agatha ? Dash , are you there ? Dash , I need your help . I 'm Arthur .

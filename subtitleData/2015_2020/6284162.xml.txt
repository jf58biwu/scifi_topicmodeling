 Big jim : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , Forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons- - Rage ... Grief ... Fear . My god . ( people exclaiming ) Now , in order to survive , We must battle our most dangerous adversary ... The enemy within . Marston : 25 years ago , a team discovered Fragments of what appeared to be an egg . Whatever was inside that egg Altered their behavior . Norrie : Hektor martin ? Apparently , he 's the real head of aktaion . Last update has you In dr . Marston 's custody . The dome 's surface is calcifying , Unless i can bring down the dome with joe 's help . You 're pregnant ? It 's a girl . Eva : What are they all here for ? The future queen . With the right frequency and amplitude , It 's possible that the dome could shatter . Sam 's a part of the kinship , And i think he took joe . Arrested her at coggin 's funeral home . Gather everyone you can and go there . We 're surrounded . This is where we make our stand . I 'm right here . Come back to me . Julia ? ( panting ) Oh , my god . Are you okay ? Did i hurt you ? I 'm okay , i 'm okay . Are you ? The shocks , i am so ... Julia , julia . I chased you down . I tried to kill you . All of those things that i said , i didn 't mean any of it . Same here . Except how much i love you . I love you , too . You saved me from becoming one of them . You never gave up on me . I knew the real you was still in there . I am so sorry . Later . ( sighs ) the resistance . They 're hiding in the funeral home . They need all the help they can get . ( gunshots ) Hell , there are dozens of them . They 're everywhere . Stay away from the window ! That moves , shoot . What do i do ? Aim at the torches . Okay . ( gasps ) ( gun clicking ) It doesn 't work ! Safety 's on . They 're not coming to capture us . They 're coming to burn us to the ground . ( panting ) What the hell ? Somebody else out there shooting . Stay there ! Who the hell are you ? Hektor martin . He runs aktaion . Look , i 'm here to help . Where can we take you to be safe ? Now ! All right , cover me . I 'll lead . We need to talk about this once , just the two of us . Yesterday was awful , okay ? Everything 's been pretty much a nightmare Since you came out of those cocoons . We don 't have to do this now . Yeah , but we can 't pretend it didn 't happen . I know . What i don 't know is how we can get back to ... What we were , or if we even can . Look , things are different . Eva is pregnant . That baby is mine . Now , i 'm not gonna bail on being a father . That child is innocent of all of this . Barbie , your daughter ... Whoa , my daughter what ? Christine kept detailed notes on a voice recorder . It 's an instruction manual on how to use us To keep the life force alive . She made it for her successor , the next queen . And she paired you and eva together for a reason . Your daughter is that queen . So christine did this . ( scoffs ) I know it 's a lot to take in , But at least we have nine months to figure it out . Norrie , jim . They were all in there . Stay here . I 'll check it out first . Good work bringing joe back . When he took him to the funeral home , He said he thought the schematic Was a way to bring the dome down With sound waves or something . That 's why christine wanted him . We need joe to start working immediately . I don 't see him cooperating . We have ways . Tell the others norrie is not to be killed . Leverage ? If we need it . Joe . The kinship needs your help . The dome is calcifying , And for us to survive , we need you on our side . Never gonna happen . You backstabbing ass . Well , we tried nice . It 's possible nobody survived this attack . The only bodies are out here . Jim had other safe houses on his radar . Maybe they escaped . Yeah , or they were taken . If they 're alive , it won 't be for long . The kinship still thinks that i 'm a part of them , So why don 't i head down to town hall , See what i can find out . Okay , i 'll go check out the other places The resistance could be hiding . What if ... Somehow they know you 're not one of them anymore ? Hey , they won 't . I can fake it . And if you see eva again ? I was used . I was manipulated by christine to father a child . The only thing that i feel right now is anger . So i 'm gonna go in , I will find out what we need to know , And i will come back to you . Okay ? Be careful . I will . You , too . Take this . If-if i 'm gonna pass with the kinship , They need to believe that i killed you , So if you 're seen , we 're done for . All right , well ... Well , take my car . ( sighs ) I 'm dead , can 't drive it . Right . Meet me at hallorann 's dock in two hours ? Yeah . Hey . Hey , indy . Hey , boy . Let me look at that . Oh , you had my back , huh ? Good boy . I have an idea . Want to go find jim ? I think i know which one of us he 's gonna be happier to see . Come on . Let 's go , boy . Let 's go . Limited doors , secured windows , closed-circuit camera , good . Set up base ! We 're holding up here with aktaion ? Yeah . What about joe ? We should go after him . Newsflash : We 're being hunted . We just have to sit tight . No one said you could stay . This is my safe house . ( chuckles softly ) That 's a hell of a way to thank the man That just saved your life . I don 't owe you squat . Actually , you do . Dr. Marston . I sent supplies here for his rescue . He wasn 't at the funeral home , he 's not here . So where is he ? He 's stashed . In a safe place . Where ? I 'll take you to him . No , no , no , no , no . Just you and me . I 've never trusted anybody in a black suit , Tie or otherwise . ( chuckles softly ) Jim , you don 't call the shots . Disarm him . Take me to marston . What are we waiting for ? Back to work . Take care of the injured . Where 's christine ? She 's at the jacobsen 's farm , taking care of eva . I know about the baby . Is everything okay ? Yeah , everything 's fine . Christine says they 're not to be disturbed . What about julia ? It 's done . Where 's the body ? Buried at shumway 's cabin . The resistance still out there ? Unfortunately , But we have who we need : Joe . ( chuckles ) you don 't know ? Our survival depends on a device that can bring down the dome , And christine needs joe to build it , But he refuses to help . Well , where is he ? No , i 've already tried . Take me to joe . ( sighs ) Hey , careful . That thing might be loaded . It is , but ... I don 't know how to use it . ( sighs ) ( laughs ) All right . Come here . Now , your safety , Your slide , Your front , rear sight for aim . Got it . All right , that oak , that 's your target . Tell me what to do . All right . Two-handed grip , Your feet apart . Come on . Bend your knees . This ain 't charlie 's angels . Now aim ... And squeeze that trigger Steady and slow . What the hell ? Noise will give away our location . I hope you never have to use it . You take a life , changes a person . So what if you need to shoot ? Silencer . Hunter : Hi . Hi . ( chuckles softly ) I never thought we 'd meet in person , And now you 're here . Obviously , i 've got questions . ( chuckles ) What ? I saw you fall . Satellite surveillance . I 'm sorry . You 've seen a lot of other stuff , too . Yeah , that file You sent me was everything Aktaion had on the dome from day one . Why 'd you dump it ? Thought maybe one day we 'd need it . And the folder with the m.I.T. Time-lock-level encryption ? Who 's gonna need that ? What ? An unnamed folder is buried in those files . Someone worked very hard to hide it . I didn 't know it was there . Do you think you can open it ? Okay , legend , I want to watch . See hunter the hacktivist in action . ( laughs ) Lily , the last time i saw you , You grabbed a hand cannon and booked it . Someone was chasing you , And you ran through the red door . It 's the only way to get here . What is ... ? ( quietly ) : I want to tell you , But i need to run it by hektor first , okay ? Trust me . Big jim : Oh , my god . I warned marston . Hektor : Yeah . Big jim : Well , it was probably a raid . You saw the way they came after us . What was marston doing here ? Why wasn 't he with you ? Hey , hey . I rescued him from those zombies , okay ? I told him to come with us to the funeral parlor , He wouldn 't be safe here . He said he needed to get back to his lab . Oh , damn it . If he 's dead and his samples are destroyed , Then everything i came here for is gone . What 'd you come here for ? All right . There 's no more to see here . Sorry about your friend . Sorry doesn 't mean a damn thing . This isn 't about marston anymore . This is about all those people . It 's about your son . What about junior ? He was one of the first infected . Patrick : This is it ! This is it , bud . We are putting humpty-dumpty back together again . ( chuckles ) Ah . Looks like a perfect fit . This makes everything we 've done worth it . ( electrical crackling ) Look ! ( electrical humming ) It 's working ! ( laughing ) This is the beginning . Clean , unlimited energy for the world . Unlimited clean money for us ! Patrick ? Patrick , what are you doing ? Uh ... There 's something drawing me to it . I ... Patrick ! Patrick , what are you doing ? It wants me to touch it . Patrick , don 't ! Remember alaska ! Patrick ! No , patrick ! Patrick ! ( echoing ) : Patrick ! All right , so your friend 's an idiot . What 's that have to do with my son ? After patrick touched the egg , he deteriorated . I hired one of the world 's Leading epidemiologists to investigate . Marston ? That 's what he was doing here . Finding a cure . Without him , Without dna he collected from christine price , it ... ( sighs ) And you . He e-mailed us meticulous notes . You gave him a hard time . After that , i never saw him again . We didn 't have any eyes inside the house , No satellite images of his ... Kidnapping . We were on the move when this raid happened . ( gulps ) Blind spots . And you . And you 're a killer . Men , women , Young , old . Your hands are soaked with their blood . Hey , just , uh , calm down there , okay ? Hey . You killed him . Marston wouldn 't come back here if he knew there was a threat . Maybe marston needed you . I don 't . Wait , wait , wait , wait . You shoot me , and you 'll never get what you want . What 's the first thing your company does When they send a unit into the khyber pass , huh ? They find a village or a local Who can tell them things that no satellite can . Access , intel ... Christine 's dna . Whatever you need , I 'm the only one that can get it . I 'm here now . No blind spots . You better deliver . ( door opens ) Nothing you do to me will make me help you . There 's no reason for you not to help . ( sighs ) The resistance has been killed . Including julia , thanks to barbie . Is that true ? It 's true . Joe , it 's time you started working with us . You 're fighting for nobody but yourself . There 's nothing left for you but the kinship . Okay , that 's enough . Go to hell . ( grunts ) That 's enough . I said , that 's enough . ( whispers ) : Hey , get out of here . He 's never going to listen to you . Good cop , bad cop . I get it . Joe , i am not one of them . Okay ? It 's really me . I didn 't kill julia . She 's the one that brought me back . What about norrie ? And the others ? I 'm hoping they 're still alive , But we got to get you out of here . I fell for this before with sam . Look , i promise you , This is real . Come meet julia with me . Joe , this is me . It 's the same guy that found you At the sweetbriar after angle died . I was there for you then ; i am here for you now . If i was one of them , wouldn 't i want you To stay here and build this thing ? All right , point taken . Welcome back . So , the dome- - is it calcifying ? Yes . Then it 's sealing up . A-air 's not gonna get through , and we 'll-we 'll suffocate . Barbie , i have to stay and build this device . What are you talking about , stay ? I hate to help the kinship , But it 's the only way out of here . And if i work with them and figure out how to build it , Then everyone 's free . And then what ? I mean , christine 's got to have other plans for us Once this dome comes down . Well , i-i don 't know . But the longer we both work with them , The better our chances of finding out . And you know what 's going to happen to you After you build this thing ? Once they don 't need you anymore ? I 'll be killed . But if i don 't do this ... We 're all dead . Joe 's gonna work with us . Are you sure he 's not gonna ... . He 's not your concern anymore . Put sam on him . Copy that . Let me explain something to you . That , back in there ... That wasn 't good cop , bad cop . This kinship has a hierarchy ; We all have our place . Remember yours . Where you going ? If you 're headed to see eva , Christine said no one 's to disturb them . I already told you that . Eva 's pregnant with my child . I 'm gonna make sure she 's okay . What did it feel like ? When you killed julia ? Like i gave a great gift to our cause . Big jim : So this stuff is gonna save junior ? We 'll infuse the serum with christine 's dna , Which contains a pure form of the infection . Once injected , the infection ... Sounds like voodoo . It 's based on cutting-edge research . Two days ago , I infiltrated town hall and almost assassinated One of the kinship 's highest ranking citizens . Let 's just say i 'm not one of their favorite people . Hard to believe . I go in there and get your sample from christine , It 's a big risk . I don 't know if this so-called " cure " is worth it . We can do it without you . Yeah . Three of my men were seal team . Well , good luck . It 's your guys against 2,000 . You know , jim , you 're not doing us a favor . Last time i checked , your backup was pretty weak . Besides , if you care anything about your son , It 's a risk you 'll want to take- - trust me . 'cause what can happen Will scare the living hell out of you . Patrick : Orange moons ! ( sobs ) ( coughing ) ( gasping ) : C-can 't breathe . ( alarms beeping ) Pink stars . So beautiful . Oh , pink stars falling . Falling in lines , falling in lines . Patrick , n-nothing 's falling . Okay ? You 're safe here . Launch them . Hurry . After the queen is born , the war begins ! Hurry , hurry ! Listen , listen to me , listen to me . I 've got a team on this , okay ? They 're the best in the world . We 're gonna find a way to get you better . ( gasping ) The eggs are important . You 've got to keep going ! ( groaning ) ( screaming ) He 's hurting himself . Shh . Hey . ( panting ) We 've got to keep him restrained . It 's for his own good . I 'll be outside . ( groaning ) Hey . Hey , papa-dop . I brought something . ( panting ) Listen , listen . Remember every sunday , we 'd go to that coffee shop , Read the paper and go to a movie ? Do you remember that ? I thought maybe the smell could take you back there . ( alarms stop , monitor beeping steadily ) ( panting slows ) You 'd tell me ... " plenty of time later in life for caffeine . " " one day , i 'll be happy if that 's The only drug you ever take . " Dad Do you remember that ? It 's time ! It 's come . We will live on ! ( groaning loudly ) ( screaming ) Hektor : We couldn 't save him . Well , that 's a touching story . Any of it true ? Why would that be a lie ? I don 't know . Maybe someone 's trying to pluck on my heartstrings , Uh , so they can further their own agenda . The only agenda we have is to cure this town . ( chuckles ) I know enough about your company to suspect that ain 't the case . Jim , junior 's been infected for about a week . The longer you wait , the worse it 'll get . What happened to patrick Will happen to your son . ( dog barks outside ) Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! ( guns clicking ) Big jim : Indy ! Hey , there you are , boy . Hey , indy , how are ya ? Hey , what happened ? Don 't you worry . I know who did this . Hey , jim . Over here ? Drop your weapons . Raggedy ann 's with us . Lower your weapons . You don 't look like you killed a man . Didn 't have to . I got through to barbie . Whatever infected him , it 's gone . That 's impossible . And you are ? Hektor martin . Hektor founded aktaion . He 's come bearing gifts . A cure for said infection . Well , whatever you brought , we don 't need it . Dale barbara isn 't better . He 's in a dormant phase . Once an infection 's in a person , it 's there forever . It 's like chicken pox . Exactly . It can recur anytime . It happened to my partner After he touched an egg we found in mexico . Once the dormant phases disappeared , The infection won out . That was a different egg . So was the one in alaska . You have no proof that what happened to your partner Or those scientists will happen here . Could i talk to you inside , alone ? Julia . What if hektor is right ? If this infection can come back , Then we should go get joe and barbie so they can be cured . We don 't know hektor . Or if what he 's saying is true . But we do know barbie and joe . Barbie is the same guy he was before the cocoons . Isn 't joe ? Yes . But sam was himself , too , And then after he was with christine , He went back to being one of them . But joe is strong ; he 's like you . Right after the cocoons , i was with all of them , And i felt this pull to the kinship . Barbie is at town hall . He 'll find joe , and they 'll come back . We just need to trust them . Good work leaving the clue at the funeral parlor . The baby bottle was brilliant . I was looking out for you . And now i want to do the same for joe . Why are you working with the people Who captured and tortured you ? After everything that has happened under this dome , Now aktaion 's here to help ? I don 't think so . I don 't trust ' em . But they didn 't blow my brains out , okay ? And on the outside chance they do have a cure , Junior 's gonna be first in line . I mean , don 't you want a vial waiting for your boyfriend ? I told you , he doesn 't need it . Love saved him . ( laughs ) Yeah , go ahead and laugh . Love saved him , i see . Yeah , so love trumps five years of medical research ? I 'll tell you , i have $ 1,000 that , uh , Barbie 's back at town hall making more babies with eva . She 's still alive ? What happened to plan b ? Didn 't work out . ( sighs ) hell . I 'll be back . I got to go meet barbie . So joe 's a double agent . And all we have to do is stay alive Until he builds christine 's device , assuming it works . Well , it better . Because the dome is calcifying . If it doesn 't come down , then we 're all dead . And aktaion 's alleged cure , that won 't even matter . All right , you ready to go meet hektor ? ( sighs ) Actually ... There 's something else that i need to do . Christine took eva out to jacobsen 's farm . And you want to go out there . I 'm just worried about the baby . Is that all ? Julia ... How was it , being back with the kinship ? Did you feel any kind of a pull ? No . There 's nothing at all . I don 't want you to go . I want you to come back to the resistance with me . But i understand why you need to . I respect it . You 're gonna be a great father . The baby- - i just wanted that to be us . I know . Me , too . Julia , i am with you . And you need to trust me . I do . I just don 't trust them . When will you be back ? As soon as i can . Okay ? Stop touching me . I 'm tired of being cooped up in this filthy barn . Eva , try to relax . I can 't . Where 's dale ? He left to kill julia hours ago . What if he couldn 't do it ? What if they 're out there right now together ? The anxiety you 're feeling is normal- - About becoming a mother , about the unknown . I felt the same way . This is different . Of course . You 're carrying the queen . But barbie is your mate . And once he sees you , he 'll never leave again . Christine is making sure of it . Charlotte . You 're the first . Are you ready ? Yes . Here . The queen needs you . So don 't be frightened . What happens next will be beautiful . This is it ? How am i supposed to figure this out Without the proper tools ? There are seven amethysts here . It 'll have to do . It 's all you could get , isn 't it ? Because you 're that low on the totem pole . Babysitter duty . Just a slave who does whatever he 's told . Hell , you even have to do whatever i tell you . Your words don 't mean anything to me . When i gave myself to the kinship , my guilt , My shame , and the need for your forgiveness melted away ... ( high-pitched screeching ) What are you doing ? Isolating frequencies , trying to see if i can break that bowl . Is that necessary ? It is if i say so . You 're alive . I 'm hugging you , aren 't i ? Is that a gun ? Yeah , i 'm breaking you out . Okay , if we distract sam , then you can go Out that door by the old jail . ( screeching stops ) what is that ? Are you helping them ? Yeah . But i 'm not one of them . Like , it 's me . Look how happy i am to see you . Well , then why are you doing this ? My theory was right . The schematic shows how to bring the dome down . And then we can finally be together Out of chester 's mill in the real world . Not some fake-ass reality Where someone 's pulling our strings . So you 're gonna stay here then ? I got barbie looking out for me . And it 's kind of badass . Yeah , it is kind of badass . Come here . Look , you got to go . Sam could come back any time . Big jim : Guilt 's a powerful motivator , isn 't it ? This dome is here because of you . I saw that footage of christine and eva When they found the egg and what happened next . They work for you . ( sighs ) yeah , when i sent them in , I had no idea that a dome would come down . It never happened before . But you did know they could get infected . That 's why we kept working on a cure . I knew i couldn 't save my best friend , But maybe i can save the 2,000 people that we put under here . I got something for you that 's bigger Than a cure for this infection . There 's a way out of here . How ? Christine price . She 's planning on bringing the dome down . I saw a schematic . Maybe ... Maybe that drawing 's the key . I don 't know . Then they kidnapped joe mcalister . He 's a smart kid Who was already working on all this . So , what are you proposing ? I get you the dna sample you need To complete your formula ... You cure the town . When the dome comes down , we 're both heroes . Deal ? Yeah , deal . Oh , and , hektor ? Don 't get any ideas about double-crossing me . Hold on . Let me in ! Come on . She 's kicking . Wow . ( laughs ) Christine made it happen . With the help of some very young devoted women . ( sighs ) I-i don 't even know what to say . Your face says it all . Dale , we 're gonna be a family . Our daughter 's destined for greatness , And she 's gonna be here any day . We need to make sure she 's safe . Yeah , of course . Did you take care of julia ? Is she dead ? Julia won 't be a problem anymore . I-is something wrong ? No . No . Hey . I am just as excited about this as you are . Come here . You find anything under the cabin ? No . But something real bad went down inside . Yeah , but that doesn 't mean that julia 's dead . Barbie said he buried her around here , but there 's no grave . You think we should keep looking ? You know what i think ? I think barbie lied . He 's a traitor to the kinship . You go back to town . I 'm telling christine . ( low buzzing tone ) What are you for ? ( sighs ) ( whistling tune ) ( whistling continues ) ( whistling stops ) Hunter : Okay , lily , let 's crack this folder . Let 's play . ( beep ) Lily 's dad ? I thought he was dead . ( typing ) This ... This was four days ago . What jim said about a way out ... Lily . I know when we came here , we thought it would be forever , But ... If he 's right , We could have a happily ever after . We know too much . I promised your father that i 'd keep you safe . This is the only place that nobody can get to us . So , deal or no deal , I 'm gonna do whatever it takes to make sure That this dome never comes down . Beau : The team is all geared up for chester 's mill . Just confirming your supply order . As much as we can carry . We 're not coming back . I 'm sealing off this wing . Is the red door set ? Explosives are all in place . Military will not be able to follow us . ( beeping ) Hektor . I have to go . I can 't take you with us , but , look , i-i promise I 'll-i 'll keep lily safe , okay ? I 'm-i 'm sorry , patrick . Hektor ! Hektor ! ( sighs ) ( gasps ) Julia , what are you doing here ? Never mind that . What are you doing ? What happened to those girls ? They pledged their vitality to the queen And safeguarded the future of the kinship . You mean they were sacrificed . Guard ! Harriet . Guard ! Don 't . I 'm your friend , okay ? You 're a threat to eva 's baby , julia , And you must be Taken care of . Guar ... ( panting ) Come on . Let 's go share our good news with the town . I 'm sure they 'll be as happy as we are .

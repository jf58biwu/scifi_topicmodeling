 Hello , Ms. Goderitch . - What happened to your voice ? - Nothing . This is my truth voice . She 's more than suspicious . She 's investigating the shit . She 's starting to piece it together . Krystal is a naive subject . She has some delusions about her circumstance , but she 's harmless . We gotta keep her on the move . I thought my DNA was supposed to make you better . It takes time to develop a therapy . - You don 't want to go sticking your head out for the Hendrixes . - And why is that ? - He said they 're dealing pills out of Bubbles . - I created you as a beautiful baseline . I don 't see any alternative . The carriers ? The device in Sarah ? But share the Original 's genome , and together , we can make a cure . Beth , what the hell are you doing ? Now , you 're off the case , but you keep digging and digging - and digging . - You can do this . Your ID , please . Your ID , please . Ma 'am , your ID . Thank you . I 'm glad that morale is good . Two dead test subjects in as many weeks is not . - We 've got it under control . - What good are your implants if patients keep tearing them out ? Thank you . Oh , dear ! - Here , Susan . - Uh , never mind , I 'll just go find some place to wash up . Susan Duncan ? I know you . I know everything . Are you ready to meet our Original ? After all these years , - I feel electric . - When it 's done , when I have my cure ... Perhaps we could go back to Tristan da Cunha . The summer you rescued me from Yale . I was researching the pathogenesis of rare disorders . - You remember ? - I remember the villa . - With a lovely topaz roof . - It was red . Of course . What was the name of the town nearby ? You 're testing me . I 'm not glitching . I 'm sorry . It 's been two months since your last cognitive exam . Hook me up right now . Test me if you like . We won 't ever have to test you again . So long as Sarah listens to reason . Cosima , are we seriously considering handing over Kendall 's genetic material ? Susan gets to restart human cloning with new lab rats to study the genome , and in return , you get that bot out of your face and we get to collaborate on a cure . Aren 't you and Scott well on your way to that ? The last viral vector didn 't work . And even if the next one does ... I may not have that much time , Sarah . OK . So what are you gonna tell Siobhan ? She 's just gonna say no , so I think we set it up first . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . It 's not her life , is it ? It 's our decision . But we can 't help them cure Castor . If we give the Neos Kendall 's genome , they 'll have the sterilizing pathogen again . I may have a workaround , but you 're not gonna like it . And I 'm trying to , like , change my life right now . Like , I shouldn 't have to live my life that way . I need protective custody now because if DYAD doesn 't get me , then Brightborn definitely will . Alright . Can I have your name , please ? Krystal Goderitch . - With a K in Krystal , obviously . - Of course I 'm available , but you can 't call me here . What kind of attitude did you expect ? Hey . - Can I have a pen ? - Mother or mistress , huh ? What are you doing , Arthur ? Nothing , I just wanted to , uh ... want to thank you for warning me about the Hendrixes . You 're welcome . Just , uh , just stay out of it . - I 'll do that . - Are you taking - any medications , ma 'am ? - No . God , everyone thinks I 'm crazy . - Or they try to get my number . - You know what , Constable , why don 't I handle that for you ? Hi . Detective Bell , homicide . Krystal Goderitch , manicurist . Why don 't we take this somewhere more private . You 're the boss . So I was kept in this room for , like , an hour . And then , they just gave me free samples . Like , you can you believe that ? Like , I 'm a whistleblower ; I 'm not gonna just , like , be paid off with free samples . OK , wait , wait . Let 's just back off for one second , OK ? - Certainly . - These people after you ... They 're targeting beauty professionals . R-right . Yeah . And some of us know what they 're actually doing , which is hoarding patents in stem-cell cosmetics and totally testing on human beings . Like , I 'm against animal testing . - OK . - Humans is , like , too far . - Do you know what I mean ? - Right . Does " Leda " mean anything to you ? Yeah , I love their eyeliner . OK . Dark Confidant and Time Walk are key . I never play without them anymore . Most people think rare cards must be awesome . Not so . Tell your son to play the game , not the markets . Stop pestering my driver ! - No smoking . - Here you go . OK . Siobhan . I 'm glad you 're here . You 're alright , Ma ? Because you 're being really nice . It 's about my other daughters . I 'll let Cosima explain . Sarah Manning , welcome to Brightborn . You 're Evie Cho , right ? I 'm gonna pass on the tour ; Cosima doesn 't recommend it . - Did you come alone ? - No . Got an army outside . If I 'm not out in 20 minutes , your Original takes an acid bath . You understand ? Then , we better hurry . Susan 's waiting . Susan Duncan ? Yeah , that 's the same look Leekie gave me . I 'm sorry . It 's just strange to see an unfamiliar face . Is that a joke ? No . You 're a mystery to me , I like that . Christ ! A Castor . Actually , I 'm a Libra . This is Ira , my assistant . - A breed apart . - From what ? Dobermans ? I 'm nothing like my brothers , Ms. Manning . You 're safe here . Sarah , please sit . Before we discuss Kendall , I wanna know what this thing 's doing to me . The devices do different things for different subjects . For instance , you mentioned Aldous Leekie . He had one treating a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer 's . But what 's mine doing ? It 's making you sick . You 're immune to the disease . By activating specific genes , we hoped - to isolate the illness . - Apparently , it hasn 't - flipped off the right switch yet . - Why ? ' Cause I 'm healthy ? - Because you 're alive . - We could have it out , we can start work on a cure today , if you just share Kendall . Only her unique biology makes you and cloning possible . Those same cells could give you the Castor pathogen . So Cosima 's come up with a solution . What kind of solution ? Kendall Malone has cancer . Leukemia . Ma , you should have ... you should have told me . And seeing that look for the rest of my life ? But we ... we can ... we could get a doctor . I mean someone we can trust - obviously ... - Chicken , it 's too late . And it 's not your choice . Cosima , tell her what you told me . Uh , Kendall 's cancer might actually save us . Kendall 's a chimera , right ? Half her cells are Castor ; the other half are Leda . No way to tell which was which . Until now . So you have all these white blood cells and one of them goes nuts and starts multiplying like crazy . Millions of cancer cells . All of those are clones of that ... first white blood cell . And luckily for us , the first one ... It 's just got Leda , right ? The Leda genome . Yeah , exactly . So , if we isolate those leukemia cells , we don 't give them Castor ; we only give them Leda . An ingenious solution . - She 's good , your sister . - Self-made . Well , I can see an obvious problem . You 're a biological weapon , mate . We 're not saving Castor . Susan ? Fetch me a hard drive , please . Ira , please . I accept your terms , but I want to be there when the samples are taken from Kendall . - I thought you might . - And I want Cosima 's research on the disease transferred to my hard drive . She 's closer to it than anyone ; I think that her insights will be valuable . You 're not the first Leda to make it this far , you know ? - What are you talking about ? - Ira . Beth ? Beth thought she found her enemy ; she was wrong . I hope you don 't make the same mistake she did . Put your hands up . - How did you find me ? - I 'm a cop , I have resources . I figured it out . You 're the head of the snake ; you 're where this all ends . You 're mistaken . I 'm your creator . - I 'm invested ... - Shut up ! Your mother 's name is Ruth , isn 't it ? - Yes . - Kind woman . Wanted a daughter more than anything . I was happy to oblige . We had no idea about your father . We screened for tendencies like that . Somehow , he got through . I 'm sorry . Stop it ! You manipulate us . Turn around ! We guide you ! I saw you graduate . You recall ? - Get on your knees . - You polished - that badge to a mirror shine . - I said , get down ! Why are you doing this ? If I kill you , it 's over . The monitors , the testing , the lies ! You control Neolution ! No one controls the idea ! Kill me and someone will take my place , but they will not protect you as I have ! Protect us from what ? From my own mistakes . Beth , whatever you think you know , you must believe this : I have devoted my life to sustaining yours . Without me , your sisters will wither on the vine , and I cannot bear that . I love you all . - I love you . - Close your eyes . We knew Beth was in deep , but trying to kill Susan Duncan ... So what stopped her ? Look at her . Another one who thought she could do it all on her own . We had to make a deal , S. You bartered my mother behind my back . Cosima needs a cure . I need this bot out of my face . - It 's trying to make me sick , S. - Not just your necks on the line though , is it , Sarah ? Kendall agreed to it . I just got her back . Mum ... - I 'm sorry . - I will do my part . I 'll keep Susan honest and everyone safe , but this is the wrong play , Sarah . You 're putting us all at risk . You 'll meet Scott at Fee 's in an hour . Bring Benjamin . Leekie 's Alzheimer 's bot is looking a little peaked . Suppose we should feed it blood , like Little Shop of Horrors . Yeah ' cause that ended well . OK , here it is ; one terabyte of data , three months of blood , sweat and fluid samples , two relationships , one missing soulmate . Well , Shay was a rebound , so one-and-a-half relationships . One and three quarters tops . I just don 't know if sharing this is a win or ... Surrender ? We would have cracked it , if we had the time . Yeah . - Yeah , let 's do this . - Yeah . Leda is everything . - I wish you 'd understand . - I do understand . You need your girls to build a better human . My life is expendable . Oh , please , don 't talk like that . I don 't want to die , Susan . I want to be with you . I will find a way for you as well . I promise . You believe me ? - Sarah , I don 't get it . - I 'm sorry , Art . I think when Beth couldn 't pull the trigger on Susan , - she just couldn 't live with it . - No , I watched that video a hundred times . The wig , the gun , and then she comes back again ? I mean , if she didn 't shoot anybody ... - Why the blood on her hands ? - Exactly . OK . Yeah , well , what about this thing here ? Krystal thinks Vidal Sassoon is after her . Krystal ? Shit . Uh , I 'll get Fee to call you , alright ? He 's got a way with that . OK . You 're sure you and Cosima don 't need backup at Brightborn ? No , we 've got it covered . I should be bot-less in an hour . Sarah , you watch your back . This is what killed Beth . Arthur , this is a harebrained scheme . Who would buy it ? Actually , Krystal . OK , yeah , fine . I 'll be there soon . Susan 's en route . You call me when you 're done with the hairdresser . She 's an esthetician . We need to keep the situation under control , Fee . Just promise me that Adele is not gonna walk in . It 's a moot point ; she went home . Felix , when this is all done , bring her back . I want the whole family here for Ma . Everyone . Kendall 's a tough old badger , Mum . OK ? She 's still - got time . - They 're coming up . Yeah . They 're here . - Are you all set ? - Ready to separate the Original 's cells . Just need one Original . Ma , showtime . Mrs. Malone , it 's an honour . Maybe this isn 't such a good idea after all . Hey , we 're gonna get that thing out of your face . Uh-huh . OK ? Then I 'll take you for ice cream , if you 're good . The extraction is safe , but delicate . We 'll put you under . You 'll sleep right through it . - No . Not her . - Why not ? I can still taste your partner 's fingers in my mouth . Yeah , I 'm assisting . Got your back . You can watch Scott work from there . Take a seat . Thank you . Cosima says they 've started . Last needle , I promise . Do you know why your biology is so unique , Mrs. Malone ? Just my bloody luck . Yes , you 're a true anomaly . The only clonable subject my husband ever found . No wonder he hid your identity so well . Hid me from the likes of you . Ethan saw the best in people ; I see the most . And right now , you are the most valuable person in the world . What are the striations ? Nerves ? Neuromorphic grid , biofeedback , not hardcoding . - More resilient that way . - So it has instincts ? - Uhh ! - Sorry . - Syringe . - Yeah . The implant reacts to heat and pressure variants . This enzyme neutralizes those receptors , puts it to sleep . No toxic failsafe . Forceps . There you go . You 're doing really well , Sarah . Almost there . Ah ? It 's leaking toxin . I can 't extract without rupturing it . You 're OK . OK , we plug the leak , right ? - Yes . - Just breathe , Sarah . If that toxin hits her bloodstream , she 's dead . OK . Here I go . Don 't move . Don 't move . It 's tearing . Now or never . - Don 't move . - Careful . OK . Alright , now pull it out very , very carefully . Do it slowly , slowly . Good . Good job . Great . Great . You said it was safe . You must have damaged it trying to remove it . Hey , you did it . Uh-huh . I 'm ready to aspirate the cancer cells . I 'm so sorry . You 're getting what you want , aren 't you ? I 'd spit , but she 'd probably bottle it . - What 's happening ? - It 's out . I 'm coming . - Get Kendall on the move . - OK . - Is Cosima still with Evie ? - She 'll leave Brightborn as soon as Susan has her samples . OK . Finish up , Scott . You 're done , Ma . Benjamin ! Before you leave , Mrs. Malone , I want to thank you . You won 't live to see it , but you have given us all a better future . Let 's go . Uh , I 'll see you later , Ma . You ... you did good . Watch her . It 's not over . You got that lighter ? Yeah . Wham ! I popped that husky masseur right onto his behind . But he must have had backup or something , and she must have had a green belt 'cause she had me in an arm lock before I could even block it . OK . - Is that your guy ? - Listen , just relax , OK ? This guy knows more about this than anybody alive . Hello ! - What the hell are you wearing ? - What ? International intrigue lacks flair . Look , I just need to know that you can do this , alright ? I don 't want her to rabbit on us . She 's not gonna rabbit , OK ? It 's gonna be fine . - Krystal . - Oh , my God ! - It 's OK . It 's OK . - Oh , my God ! You 're that guy who stole my wallet right before I was kidnapped ! - Oh , yeah . - Well , Krystal , this is , uh , Inspector Dawkins . - From the Yard . - What yard ? - Scotland Yard . - Yes . Oh ! He 's a cop ... from London . - You said Scotland . - OK , that 's as far as that 's gonna go . Krystal , truth voice . Right ? Do you remember what I said to you the first time we met ? - That I wasn 't alone . - That 's right , darling . - And you know our names ... - Oh my God ! - Oh , Jesus ! - God , it burns ! - Oh , shit ! I 'm so ... - Put the mace away ! - Put it away ! - What 's wrong with you ? ! Aaah ! Ugh ! - You alright , Sarah ? - Brilliant . - Susan . - Hello , Sarah . How are you , luv ? Been better . These are done , the samples ? Uh , 52 Leda cells . Just enough for a sustainable line . Which I will hand over once I get confirmation Cosima is free . She 's remarkable , Cosima . I wish Rachel had such an inquiring mind . They 're all so different . - Yeah , you 've no idea . - Whoa ! Is that bleach ? - Are you out of your mind ? ! - Benjamin ! - Thought I smelled trouble . - You 've just destroyed yourself - you stupid girl ! - Sarah , you want to tell us what you 're doing ? Kendall 's driver 's not answering . I found her cigarettes in a pool of blood . Bathroom ! - What have you done ? - I haven 't done anything . - Bollocks ! Where 's my mother ? - If anything 's happened , it wasn 't me . We have to go , S. Hey , you 're coming with us . And your life depends on what happens next . Do you understand me ? Not just mine . What about Cosima ? She 's still at Brightborn . The power source is metabolic . From the host 's own tissue . A synthetic ATP chain . Nature is just a set of spare parts to you , isn 't it ? I think of it more as a palette . Your research ? Tell me what happened to Delphine Cormier . Who ? The former head of DYAD . Oh . Dr. Cormier of course . DYAD 's not my purview . I 'm sorry , but I knew of her and her dedication to you . Yeah , that 's what I 'm afraid of . It 's her research on there too , isn 't it ? I couldn 't have done it without her . What you started together ... we can all finish with Kendall 's genome . Susan 's gone dark . What ? ! What 's going on ? - Ugh ! - I 'm so sorry . I 'm taking self-defense classes , - so it was just like a reflex . - Oh , is that what happened ? - I have Visine in my bag if you want it . - No , that 's all right . Nothing more from your purse . Listen , just pull yourself together , OK ? She 's scared . Buck up . Oh , God . Aww , your poor skin . No , really , it 's just a flesh wound . - I 'm so bad . - Look , Krystal . You need to know that you figured it out . It 's all true . All of it . There is this dirty war being waged on stem-cell technology , trying to control it , that 's all being orchestrated by the cosmetic companies . I knew it . Yes . Yeah , all the big players are involved . Right , Art ? - Brightborn , Neolution ... - What 's Neolution ? - Ummm , uh ... - They 're Swedish . - Yes , quite European . - Oh , God . Look , Krystal , the point is , while the case is still open , you need to just live your life as normally as possible , go home . They can 't know we 're onto them . Uh ... Our numbers are in here . For emergencies only though . Are you OK ? I keep ... Ever since I smacked this French doctor at the DYAD , I just keep injuring people everywhere I go . I 'm so sorry . Do you mean - Dr. Delphine Cormier ? - Why ? Do you know her ? Is she involved in this ? Well , she 's a friend of ours . What can you tell us about her ? I 'm so sorry . Um ... I saw her get shot . I saw everything . No one will find you here . - Where is she ? Where 's Kendall ? - You think I 'd kidnap Kendall and then allow myself - to be taken hostage ? - You 'll do anything . You hunted her down for 20 years ! - It wasn 't me ! - It doesn 't make sense , - does it ? - You actually believe her ? ! She 's got the genome ; she doesn 't need to do this ! But Ira does . No . He was there when we made the deal . - The deal that denied him a cure . - He wouldn 't betray me . Not even to save his own life ? Where would we find him ? There 's a keycard in my pocket . We keep rooms at the Palmina 's . 708 . You got mama into this ; you better get her out . I 'll go with her . Shit ! He 's glitching ! Hey ! Hey , wake up ! Where 's Kendall ? Hello ! Where 's Kendall ? Hey ? Oh , shit . Stupid bugger . He 's OD 'ing . Call 911 ! He 's a dead-end , Benjamin ! Where 's Kendall ? So how are we doing back here ? There you go . Why am I out here ? It won 't be long . If you 're too cold , I have a spare blanket . Nasty business that we 're wrapped up in , isn 't it ? Someone 's got the hooks on you . I 've been hunted around the world . What 's your story ? I 'm just in over my head , lady . Just like everybody else . We can help you . My daughter , she hides people . How 's that working out for you ? At least , I can look her in the eye . You 're shivering . I 'll get you that blanket . Ira tried to kill himself . Benjamin 's watching him at the hospital . He 'd had - his stomach pumped ; he 's fine . - Forget about Ira ! What have you vipers done with my mother ? ! S , that 's enough ! Scott . There 's some kind of trojan - wiping our research . - How is that possible ? - Your system 's offline . - It had to be introduced in the hard drive from Brightborn . Sarah , we 're done . Everything is gone . Cosima 's dice has been wiped . It 's a coup . - Competing technologies . - I 'm sorry , - what 's happening ? - Whoever did this doesn 't care about Kendall 's genome ; they just want Leda destroyed . Who ? The engineer . Mrs. Malone , you should have stayed hidden . I take it this is the one who has you all twisted up ? I 'm sorry . It has to play out like this . You have your precious Original , let her go ! Stay there . This is compressed triethylaluminum . Burns at 1200 degrees . And we 've confirmed all her samples are destroyed . There will be nothing left . Susan , please , you have to tell us , - where would Evie take Kendall ? - Beth . What are you talking about now ? That 's why she wanted to kill me . Beth held a gun to my head . And Evie put it in her hand . She didn 't do it , Detective Duko . She left Susan on her knees . I 'm in the car . Get down here . - Beth ! - You set me up ! No , I didn 't . You said you wanted to put an end to this , to free your sisters . By killing the head of Neolution . She made us . She needs us . Not you . You just want to take her place . - It 's not happening ! - Oh , it is . I 'll find another way . Susan 's done . - Just like your sisters . - Don 't talk about my sisters . Beth , you know too much now . If you run , Neolution will cauterize your life . Alison , - Cosima , your parents , Paul . - Then I 'll pull - the trigger right now . - You won 't end it . You want to save the people that you love ? Use that gun on yourself . Do you think I 'm afraid to die ? Do you think I 'm scared of anything right now ? Why are you doing this ? I never understood what Susan saw in that face . In the decades of watching your tedious lives , our technology just ... passed her by . Clones are obsolete . - You 're Betamax . - Because of the bots ? We don 't need your baseline ; - we can fix people now . - You can 't perfect the human genome ! You can 't know what perfect is ! I know ! I was born sick ! I 'm sick too ; that doesn 't justify this . Da Vinci robbed graves to study anatomy . In a hundred years ... they 'll call me a pioneer . Please don 't do this . Say goodbye . Quickly . Stop there . Kendall , what do we do ? No tears , Cosima . These shites aren 't worth the salt . Tell Siobhan ... she 's done right , always . And tell your sisters I 'm proud to have been part of them all . Step back . Turn around , luv . Turn around ! Good girl ! Delphine Cormier was shot dead at the DYAD parkade . Oh , my God ! Tell Susan the Original 's dead . Tell Sarah it 's over . Or Beth died for nothing . Beth ! - Don 't make me kill a cop . - Don 't make me ! Is it true ? Will my sisters die for what I know ? They 've done it before . What 's your play , Beth ? It 's over ! We 're done ! I 'm done ! I screwed it up ! We can 't fight this anymore , Mika ! Neolution will cauterize your life . Alison , Cosima , your parents , Paul . You want to save the people that you love ? Use that gun on yourself . You need to drop all this . Go back into hiding . Drink iced tea , play video games , whatever . Just stay hidden . I have to keep everyone - that I care about safe . - Please don 't leave me . And you want that too , don 't you , Beth ? Watch the others for me .

 KIRK ( VO ) : Captain 's log , stardate 6202.1 After encountering Friendship 3 ... an interstellar probe launched from Earth 170 years ago the Enterprise computer has been infested with a pathogen of unknown origin . SPOCK : Confirmed , captain . Whatever has infiltrated the main computer is of a technology far superior to the archaic design of Friendship 3 . We 've got to pull the plug on this thing , Spock . Get it isolated . Lieutenant , contact Starfleet Command . From Kirk , commanding Enterprise : Unknown entity has infiltrated ship 's computer after encountering old Earth space probe Friendship 3 . All ships are to avoid sector ... Sierra 047 . Sierra 047 . Steps need to be taken to isolate and - - if necessary - - DESTROY the probe . Right away , sir . Firewalls proving ineffective . It is migrating from the communications system to ... - My library computer . - Computer off , Spock ! Not responding . Controls have been overriden . Spreading like a virus through my systems now , captain ! Engineering specs , diagrams , propulsion manuals ... the works . Alert computer core . Tell them to shut down all non-essential systems . Unlikely a virus , captain . I am seeing indication of a high level of intelligence from them . " Them " ? I am reading hundreds of thousands of microscopic objects ... easily out-maneuvering our computer defense systems and counteracting every attempt at blocking their progress . [ COMPUTER WHIRS ] Now accessing Federation capabilities ... Starfleet defense data ... Earth history . Activate lockdown subroutines . Your assistance is needed , Mr. Scott . McCOY : Jim ... Since you weren 't in my exam room for your appointment 30 minutes ago ... I thought a house call was in order . Not now , Bones . Even your first officer kept his appointment ... and we all know how he feels about my " beads and rattles . " We 'll talk about this later , doctor ! If we dampen the duotronic feed ... Aye ! Starve it at the source . What in blazes do you think it is ? An intelligence and getting more intelligent by the minute . SCOTT : The board 's on overload ! [ SPARKS EXPLODES ] [ GASPS ] Bones ? Here , Jim ! [ GUNFIRE MILITARY ORDERS ] [ STAR-SPANGLED BANNER FLARES ] Space . The final frontier . These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission : to explore strange new worlds ... To seek out new life and new civilizations . To boldly go where no man has gone before . [ GUNFIRE EXPLOSIONS ] Come on ! My God , Jim . Where are we ? More like " WHEN are we ? " Mid-1800s . Union . Confederacy . These uniforms ... The American Civil War . Apparently , we 're not on the same side . How ? One minute we 're on the bridge , and the next we 're ... What do you think we 're dealing with ? A parallel planet ? An illusion ? Time portal ? There 's no telling . But until we figure out how to get home ... We must assume it 's real . And if we ARE in Earth 's history ... We know the risks . We can 't do anything to upset the balance of what 's to come . The further we are from the fighting , the safer we 'll be . Has the pathogen been identified ? Not yet . There was a " transfer " of some sort after the explosion took place . I have them in a partial stasis field . They mustn 't be touched until we know what we 're dealing with . The intruders have absorbed data from various systems at an accelerated rate . We are attempting to isolate them before they can advance further . Whatever it is ... It seems to be moving through their bodies in the same manner . I 'm using antibodies to prevent more trauma ... Tranquilizers to slow their metabolisms ... but ... It 's on the march . We can 't stop it . Only delay it . SPOCK : How long ? A day . Maybe two . When these things reach their autonomic systems ... Lungs , heart ... Understood . Please inform me of any changes , doctor . I didn 't wanna say anything , Jim ... but it appears I outrank you . Too bad we 've got to stay hidden . Otherwise ... I could have some fun with you , corporal . You 're a southern gentleman , doctor . I 'd expect at least a modicum of lenience . HALT ! Looky what we have here , boys . A fancy reb sergeant . Yeah . Thought he could escape by running into the woods . But I tracked the ol ' reb down . You don 't have to worry about him . He 's my prisoner . I was just taking him back to camp . You always let your prisoners keep their weapons , corporal ? Watch him , boys . He may be secesh in Union blue . So you 're a fancy-pants reb sergeant , huh ? Betcha know what yer buddies are plannin ' for tomorrow . D 'ya ? C 'mon , answer me ... Y 'know how many soldiers they 're bringin ' in the mornin ' ? Answer me ! How many behind the front ? How about artillery ? You know anythin ' ' bout that ? You tongue-tied ? Answer me ! Wait ! This man 's a doctor ! I was taking him back to camp because he can help our wounded . This man 's gonna BE one a them wounded if he don 't learn to start answering ' . He 's MY prisoner ! You lay one more hand on him , sergeant and I 'll make sure your superiors know how you treated a valuable prize . Who are you ? Kirk . James . Tenth Pennsylvania Reserves ? That 's right ... I thought you was a lieutenant colonel . Just damn good to have you here with us . It 'll be a big one tomorrow . We 'll need all the help we can get . Get him up , boys ... and move out . [ GUNSHOT ] SNIPER ! [ GUNSHOT ] I can help this man ! This doctor knows new ways to heal . What " new ways " ? We don ' trust no damn Confederate ! You 'll trust THIS Confederate , or your sergeant dies ! Someone have a medical kit ? Do what you can for him , doctor . I 'm going to check on that other man . One of you men ... Go dig a grave for that man . That 's a reb sniper ! He 's a boy ! Not much older than some of you . Fighting for what he believes in ... just like you are . - So much for hiding out . - You okay ? Been better . Nothing compared to him . Please tell me you can help him . With these ? Out here ? - I 'm a surgeon . Not a butcher ! - Good . Because he needs a surgeon . Jim . What if this man is supposed to die ? Or what if he isn 't ... and just by being here , we 've changed all that ? He might not have gotten shot in the first place if it hadn 't been for us . What does the doctor in you say ? Somebody have a knife ? [ GROANS IN PAIN ] Hold it ! Put pressure on the wound right here . [ DRY HEAVES ] That 's about all I can do . But I need a field hospital . You do have a field hospital ? Yep . [ COUGHS ] It 's a messy business . Nothing to be ashamed about . I ain 't . Musta ate somethin didn 't agree with me . - What 's your name , son ? - Billy . - Billy Palmerton , sir . - Keep your eyes peeled , Billy Palmerton . Yes , sir . - Stand by , Mr. Scott . - Aye , sir . Cut power to computer systems ... Now . Intruders migrating from computer core to duotronic backup tapes . You were right , commander ! A new source of information was too tempting for them to ignore . How much time until the data is fully assimilated from the duotronic tapes ? Twenty-six seconds . If we 're gonna eliminate it before it jumps to the next information source we 've gotta act NOW . Mr. Chekov , prepare to jettison the backup storage assembly . Aye , sir . Charge phaser banks . Aye , sir . Without computer control , targeting 's gonna be a little tricky . They 're speeding up , Mr. Spock . It 's now or never ! Eject microtapes . Storage assembly released . SMITH : Point-seven kilometers ... Point-nine ... - One-point-one ! - Fire ! Report , Mr. Scott . It worked , sir . The varmints are gone ! The ship is safe . Who tended to this man ? Says he 's a doctor , sir . From the job he did , I 'm inclined to believe it . I tend to be a bit colorblind when it comes to uniforms these days . I haven 't slept in over 48 hours . And I could use an extra set of hands . Especially come morning . Whaddya say , doc ? Do I have to work with THESE still on ? You can take those braclets off now . - But he 's a prisoner , sir . - He 's a physician ! Take them off . If you 're so concerned , you can stand guard and watch over him . This place is gonna be a slaughterhouse tomorrow . You asked for me , commander ? It is reasonable to assume that the crew is concerned about the condition of the captain and the doctor . Since I do not share this type of " emotional vulnerability " ... I would like your counseling services available throughout the duration of this ordeal . That is a very thoughtful observation , Mr. Spock . I 'll make sure to let the crew know I 'm available to anyone at any time . Thank you , doctor . Anyone . [ BOSUN WHISTLE ] M 'BENGA : Sickbay to Mr. Spock . Spock here . At the moment , they 're both stable . I 've noticed something interesting , but I 'm not sure what it means . Please explain , doctor . Although their motor skills aren 't active ... Their neurological activity 's at an unprecedented level for patients in comas . SPOCK : Curious ... That 's not the most interesting part . The activity spikes at the exact same time in both men . As if they 're linked consciously ... Reacting to the same stimuli at the exact same moments . Thank you , doctor . Please continue to report any observations . Spock out . Ensign . When the captain activated the cutoff switch , the intruder was accessing Earth history . - Might you be able to ... - Determine the point in history at which the cutoff occurred ? That 's a pretty tall order , commander . I have complete confidence that you will be successful , Mr. Chekov . [ CHEKOV SIGHS ] For every rebel I kill tomorrow , I 'm gonna put a notch in my belt . How many notches you got so far ? [ LAUGHTER ] I 'll never understand why we 're doing so much killing ' and dyin ' just to set some slaves free . This war isn 't just about freeing SOME people . It 's about freedom for everyone . It 's what this country was built on . What 's that supposed to mean ? I 'm free ... he 's free . You 're free . Without freedom for all ... We 're all slaves . Doesn 't matter whether you 're black , white , green ... Green ? ! [ LAUGHTER ] Figuratively , of course . Meaning anyone . Even those we might not 've met yet . Thought it made sense to me when I joined up , but ... It don ' no more . Not after all I seen . There are many kinds of oppression . Like being oppressed by a society that stifles purpose . Without purpose , none of you are truly free men . You wanna talk about purpose ? I got a family back home . The days are gettin ' shorter ... an ' I should be gettin ' my farm ready for winter . I got two young 'uns . My oldest girl 's expecting . She 's about to bring a life into this world ! An ' here I am hundreds a ' miles away takin ' ' em out ! Those young 'uns of yours will be better off for your service here . How so , if their Pappy winds up shot dead ? ! What we say here will soon be forgotten . But what you DO here will be remembered . Those men across the battlefield tomorrow ... They were your brothers once . And when this is settled , they will be again . What you do here will ripple throughout history . And it will pave the way for all men to be united . Reach for the stars . [ LAUGHTER ] You got some kinda crystal ball ? How could you possibly know that ? I just know . I heard there was some coffee out here . This coffee 's for Union soldiers . He deserves some . He saved my sergeant 's life . Have some coffee , doctor . You should probably get some sleep too , Billy . Tomorrow 's a big day . How you holding up ? It 's like a living hell in there . Hacking off limbs , sewing up wounds with nothing more than a swig of whiskey to help fight the pain . In my worst dreams I never imagined such things . And it 's my fault you 're here . If I just would 've come for that physical , you wouldn 't have been on the bridge . Well , Jim ... There 'd only be one thing worse than being here with you . You being here all by yourself . Can 't have that now . All the times Spock talked about how barbaric the human race was ... You think she 's still up there ? She 's up there . Spock has the finest crew in the fleet . I know they 're doing everything they can . I should be there with them . So should I. God knows what I 've done helping men who might 've been supposed to die . And Jim ... Tomorrow you 're expected to go out there and fight . What are you gonna do ? I heard you talking to those boys , and I know you but this isn 't your fight . The reb doctor 's needed . You 're gonna have to kill , Jim . You know you can 't do that . [ MARCHING MUSIC ] When I get back , me and my girl are gonna get married . My girl Elizabeth promised me a feast a ' turkey , cornbread , an ' peach cobbler . I dream about it every night . Why wouldn ' you wanna marry a woman like that ? On account a ' her husband might not like it ! Anyone waiting at home for you , Billy ? Just my ma , sir . And I got me a dog . Maybe you could marry your dog , Palmerton ! [ LAUGHTER ] Pay no attention to him . I 'm scared , sir . It takes a brave man to admit that . Thank you , sir . But I don ' feel so brave . Stay close to me . You 'll make it through . We both will . CHARGE ! [ YELLING ] [ EXPLOSIONS GUNFIRE ] FIRE ! Fire , corporal ! Fire ! Fire ! Where the hell 're you firing ' , dammit ? ! Fire right ! KIRK : Billy ! Billy ! Sir , I think I 've got it ! According to the computer the intruders were consuming data from Earth year 1862 when the board flared up . On screen . The battle of Antietam Creek . Sharpsburg , Maryland . September 17th , 1862 . One of the bloodiest days in American history . The dead , wounded , and missing totalled more than 22,000 . And Dr M 'Benga believes the captain and McCoy are somehow networked into the same subconscious imagery . You 're guessing that 's where they think they are ? I endeavor not to employ " guesses , " lieutenant . But that would be the most logical theory . Okay . You 're good . My God , Jim ! I need alcohol to clean the wound . We 're running out of every damn thing in this place . Bones ! Jim , the wound is deep . The bone is shattered . The tissue damage is severe . - If I were on the ship ... - We 're not ... We 're not . We 're here . What can you do HERE ? We 're going to have to amputate below the knee . Do what you 've gotta do . You ! Hold his shoulders . Hold the leg . Forgive me , Jim . [ KIRK SCREAMS ] Commander . I was able to isolate one of the pathogens and remove it . They 're not so much viruses ... as some sort of nanites ! Microscopic computers . They 're networked together . That 's why Doctor McCoy and the captain are experiencing the exact same images in their subconcious minds . BURKE : Doctor ... Brain impulses are spiking in both the captain and Doctor McCoy . The captain seems to be in some sort of distress ! The captain 's leg ... ... it 's dying ! I keep thinking that maybe this isn 't real . You did what you had to do . What happened to him ? Ah . I think a bullet might 've grazed his head . Nothing serious . He 's not wounded ? Not physically , no . Most likely a case of shell shock ... or a case of the nerves . Can 't say that I blame him . Doctor , you 're needed . - Jim , I ... - You did good , Bones . Go save some more lives . [ DOORS SWISH ] How 're they doin ' , doctor ? We 're out of time . Mr. Scott , I believe I have a theory . Dr. M 'Benga , is it possible for you to temporarily ... . ... shut down the captain and doctor 's brain functions ? For a very limited time , yes . Why ? Perhaps if the nanites believe their food sources have run out they will relocate to a new receptor . Aye ! Get rid of rats by laying ' a trail a ' food . Like we did with the Enterprise computer . Prescisely . We starve them ... . ... and then we lead them to a fresh information store . It may not be so easy this time , Mr. Spock . They 've been feeding off of a biological host . They may not be interested in an inorganic source . The ideal lure would be something cybernetic . Both biological AND mechanical . I haven 't anything ' like that , commander . A prosthetic limb ! There 's a crewmember whose arm is bio-mechanical . Of course , only the medical staff ... The captain and doctor 's lives are at stake . His name , please . Billy ? What happened ? You were wrong , sir . About what ? About me . That I could be brave . When the sergeant got hit ... I ran . Men falling ' all ' round me . I got scared . Turned and ran smack into a tree . Everything you said last night ... I wanted to believe ... That maybe there really was something more to this fighting ' . You made it sound like somethin ' ... That would 'a made my ma proud even if I didn ' come home . " Without freedom for ever 'one , we 're all slaves . " " Without purpose , none a you are truly free men . " But ... When the time came , you couldn 't shoot anyone . And I couldn ' neither . You 're right . I couldn 't , because I ... I don 't belong here . I can 't tell you why . You wouldn 't understand . But my freedom was taken away as well . My freedom ... and now my ... This isn 't my fight , Billy ! But it IS yours . If you allow any man 's freedom to be taken away they could come for yours next . Then your ma 's ... your family , your friends ! This wasn 't supposed to happen . I 'm not supposed to be here ! But YOU are . You have a purpose , Billy . Something worth fighting for . Something to stand for ! Jim ! You 'll start bleeding again ! Gimme some of that morphine they brought in ! I see you 're awake . You ready to give up that bed for another man ? There 's plenty who could use it . Lieutenant Drake . I 'm sure you are aware of the current crisis . I am , sir . I understand you have a prosthesis . I do , sir . An accident during my last assignment . The invading nanites are attracted to both biological and artificial data systems . We require a device that will lure the invaders from the captain and the doctor . Your bio-mechanical arm ... It has a cyber-neural control unit . And you think you can use it to help the captain and the doctor ? - There is a possibility that ... - I 'll do it . Lieutenant . There are significant risks . I understand . I 'll do it . Very well . But know this . Their lives depend not on just IF the nanites migrate ... But how quickly they do so . If this procedure is not successful ... ... we 'll lose all three of you . Hey . You ! Where 's Billy ? Billy Palmerton . I ain 't never seen anythin like it in my life . We were ordered to charge 'cross that bridge straight into the rebel army . We had to take that ground . It was our only chance for victory . The captain yelled " charge " none a ' us moved . We knew what was waitin 'cross that bridge . But then ... ... Billy . That mousey little Billy . He pushed his way to the front of the group ... What got into him ? He turned and faced us all ... He said " C 'mon , boys ! " " If they can take one man 's freedom , they can take all ours ! " " Are we gonna let that happen ? " And then everybody started gettin ' all riled up shoutin ' " NO ! " Billy turned and faced that bridge . Raised his rifle up . And led that charge . Blastin ' right into that rebel army . Hollerin' " FOR FREEDOM ! " Then everyone else ... " FOR FREEDOM ! " And we did it . We broke their line . What happened to Billy ? No one up front survived . But the fightin ' stopped . I think that won it for us . Hey ! The President 's here ! Jim ! Are you outta your mind ? You need to stay in bed . And miss this ? I guess that 's worth getting outta bed for . How many men get to see history unfold with one of its greatest contributors ? True . You 're a lucky man . I am . But I 'll never be the man I was . Ya know what I think , Jim ? A man with one leg can stand just as tall as any other . If he has a purpose . Perhaps even taller . Mr. Drake 's arm should prove a sufficiently tempting host . D 'you really think this can work , commander ? I estimate our odds at 492.031 against us succeeding . I believe the captain would consider those odds manageable . Please proceed . Brain activity 's been interrupted . The nanites are migrating . Come on , ya beasties . We 're seconds away from irreparable damage ! Come on ... come on ... Doctor ? That 's it ! They 've transferred to the limb . Escort Mr. Drake immediately to the transporter room . Administering stimulants . Restarting brain activity . Welcome back , captain . Doctor . The intruders have been removed . You are free . I don 't know how to thank you , Cad . William " Cadmus " Drake . Well , I do . Starfleet Medical 's developed a new and improved prosthetic limb . One 's on it 's way by shuttle . Quicker impulse response ; stronger alloy . Perhaps another spar in the gymnasium ? I 'll get back to you on that one . Kirk to transporter room . Scotty ... you ready ? SCOTT : Standing by to beam those beasties off the ship , sir . Energize transporters . Mr. Sulu , ready phasers . SULU : Phasers locked on the cannister , sir . Any parting words , Mr. Drake ? Fire . Ya know , there 's probably more a ' those things out there . You 're probably right . No telling where the probe picked them up . God help anyone who encounters them . You know , doctor ... I think you 're right . " Even taller . " Sir ? Something a wise man once said . " A man with one leg can stand even taller . " Or one ARM . Mr. Chekov . Plot a course to rendezvous with the shuttlecraft . We mustn 't keep Chief Drake waiting . I 've got a sparring match to lose .

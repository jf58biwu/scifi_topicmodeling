 Cosima : I was , like , way above , And then I came back . Delphine : Her name is krystal goderich . We intercepted them as they were forcing her Into the trunk of a car . You 're sterilising women . You did something to me . Paul : You gave her the castor pathogen , didn 't you ? You 're somehow able to fight it off . It 's a weapon . Coady : The science in this room Could rewrite the very nature of humankind . - Run ! - ( explosion ) A vote for alison hendrix Is a vote for change . Alison : Jason kissed me ? Yeah , he just came out of nowhere and did it . I signed . Bubbles is yours . My father ... Our secret language . I have a pretty serious health issue . Shay : Oh , my god . Cosima : Oh ! - Scott : What does it say ? - I 'll only tell sarah . ( upbeat music playing ) Krystal : So this guy , He had like a wicked scar , Which I was into for some reason . He was kind of dark and mysterious , And my relationship with hector was open . So I thought , " whatever . " Like , " this guy 's hot . Nobody dies . " I was like so wrong . ( sighs ) it 's terrible . Yeah , I know . I know . Anyway , so ... We get to the room , then suddenly I realised There 's another guy in the room who looks identical to him . Like , identical ! An identical twin . - ( scoffs ) - I know , right ? Twins are so creepy . - Mmm . - Yeah , they are , right ? So anyway , if hotel security hadn 't showed up , I would have been thrown in the back of a van . Like , legitimately . But they didn 't have to kill hector , you know ? Anyway ... So you 're a doctor ? Yes , I have a family practice . - Yeah . - Oh . Wow . I really relate to that , You know , just the healing arts . I feel like what I do is quite healing . - I don 't know if you feel that right now . - Yeah . But that 's just my gift . And I just feel like , You know , in spite of everything , As hard as it is losing hector , You can 't crush the human spirit . ( theme music playing ) ( music playing ) Gracias . Twins . Blonde and brunette , they come through here ? ( speaking spanish ) And , yeah , you do . I don 't remember any sisters . To castor . Decades of work , Incinerated in half a second . David : You 're lucky to be alive , doctor . Without the original genome , The few boys I have left will be dead within a year . Two , if we 're lucky . Where 's rudy ? In the field . Why ? I have a source . Inside leda . But I need something from you . Inside leda ? How the hell did you manage that ? Castor and leda . I 've been feeling this for a while . It 's not just two factions , is it ? Who 's in charge , david ? Keep your boys alive , doctor . We can all get what we want . You satisfied ? Yes . In fact , it 's the ... The best manicure I 've ever had . - And she 's rationalised her brush with castor . - Yeah . Krystal goderich is still naive . Very . Not one to pierce the veil , is she ? No . And where are you with your new monitor ? There are three candidates vying . Let 's see which one she picks . Good . You and I have a problem closer to home . How 's rachel progressing ? Well , her mobility is not looking good , But her aphasia 's improving . And she still has value . Does she ? All I know is that she 's a liability . We can 't keep her around indefinitely . I 'm fine , sarah . It was scary and gross . Yes , but not a major episode . ( sighs ) I 'm just worried about you . I am not the patient here , okay ? You 're the one who 's been through hell . Well , coady seemed to know That I was gonna beat the pathogen . Maybe she suspected that you 're functionally immune . ( stammering ) uh , it 's a prion disease . Like , mad cow , uh , twisted protein That misfolds other proteins . But you don 't have the protein that it corrupts . So , use me then As treatment for your relapse . Oh , that 's not ... That 's not really how it works . And anyway , it 's not a relapse , okay ? It 's a trend . It 's totally Plottable and expected . Delphine has teams That are working on gene therapy . We 'll know something soon . Where are you ? Oh , uh ... Friend 's . - ( clears throat ) - ooh ! Seriously ? Who ? What ? Do I have to answer to you as well ? No . Of course not . Is it good ? ( chuckles ) yes . ( chuckles ) Yeah , it 's what I need right now . Hey , what about you ? Let 's talk about what you need . I need a way forward . Feel like we 've been on our back foot Against everybody , and I 'm sick of it . But I keep thinking ... What ? I keep thinking about beth . Finishing what she started . Yeah . It 's a lot . I think about her , too . I just can 't lose another one of us . Hey . Hey , look at me . We haven 't lost anyone yet . - ( locks clicking ) - ( whispering ) I gotta go . Um , but if you do want a way forward , sarah , Just call scott . We 've been holding back something really big . Okay , bye . - Hey . - Hi . Donnie : We 're not taking in helena , too . All right ? We already hired the amish girl . She 's prolethean . And she and helena Are a package deal . Helena just got out of a rendition prison , donnie . We need to play our part . Alison , she 's crazypants . Yeah , but she 's good with kids . She just needs a bit of socialising and to be taught - A couple of life skills . - You could say that again . - Gemma : Do you like pink or purple , helena ? - ( sniffing ) This is very soft . ( speaks foreign language ) What 's that thing ? Helena : This ? This is a secret . These are my babies . I kept them at uncle felix 's to keep them safe . You 're silly . ( chuckling ) ( gemma shrieking and laughing ) Why doesn 't anyone listen to me ? - What ? - We are selling soap with helena . She 's gonna help us make it . That is it . That doesn 't answer my question , alison . - Why nobody listens to you ? - No . No ! Why doesn 't the psycho go live with one of her other sisters ? Because it 's your turn . And if you don 't do it , then I 'm gonna tell everyone That you 're awash in pills and you 're in bed with portuguese mob . Oh , there 's no need to blackmail , felix . Yes ! Yes , blackmail . - I 'm not on-board with assassin boarders . - Mom ! Thank you , sestra alison . Oh ! Such beautiful clothes . See , she fits right in . Looks good , doesn 't she , donnie ? Uh , yeah . - ( relaxing music playing ) - longer time in . ( coughing ) Sorry . ( clearing throat ) corpse pose . Mmm-hmm . Hey ... You know anything about near-death experiences ? Why , have you had one ? I had something . Well , I have a theory . Before we leave this life , We see what we loved . I mean , like , Pit-of-the-soul , can 't-live-without-it love . And if it 's strong enough , Sometimes we find our way back . Are you done corpsing out ? 'cause you 're already late for work . ( laughs ) Give you a ride in the bug ? - I should show you the secret lab . - Ah . Can I meet the genetic mutants ? Yeah , but you won 't survive that . Oh , no . Sarah : Oh , he gave that to kira . Whatever it says , duncan wanted us to have it . And only rachel can read it ? And she won 't , until she talks to you . ( sighs ) she talks now , does she ? Delphine doesn 't know anything about this ? Cosima doesn 't trust her . But I don 't know . It 's all drama with those two . Maybe we should trust her . No , no , no , no . She might give it to topside . If this is duncan 's key to everything , To your synthetic sequences or whatever , Then they could use it to restart human cloning . Right ? So we need to know what it says , and then we can decide . ( sighs ) which means I have to talk to bloody rachel . You 're improving . How unfortunate . Yeah , she 's already got a house goat and a milking stool . I didn 't mean that . I 'm a threat to her . And how did you deal with threats , rachel , When you were in my position ? ( door opens ) ( door closes ) Rachel : Ready . Looking good , rachel . New ... Accessories . ( chuckles ) Wha ... What 's this book say then ? My ... My book . But your father didn 't leave it for you , did he ? He killed himself instead and left it for kira . So we would cooperate . She thinks delphine is going to eliminate her . I translate ... - Book . - My ... My book And you take me out of here . She wants a quiet life In taiwan . You can 't disappear twice , can you ? Dead women don 't pass customs . Krystal goderich . Scott : Who 's that ? She 's leda , isn 't she , rachel ? The one that castor was after . Yes . Her monitor is ... - Dead . - Get me id . So you want me to steal krystal 's identity And get you out of dyad ? - Yes . - ( sarah scoffs ) How do I know you can even read that book ? She translated the page I gave her . What 's it say , then ? Are we in it ? No . It 's a Nursery rhyme . " in london town we all fell down ... " And castor woke from slumber . Castor . We need to know what 's inside that book , that 's the end of it . Hello . Oh , hello , love . Would you , um , grab your things , And we 'll head over to the hendrix 's , all right ? You want to free rachel Over a nursery rhyme coded in dr moreau about castor . That 's one page of it , s . There 's got to be something about us in there , And it could save cosima . Or duncan could be off his rocker , Or rachel could be full of shite . There 's only one way to know ! Scott says he and cosima can get rachel out of dyad . - How ? - Something to do with his gaming group . - ( scoffs ) - sarah : Okay , good , So krystal is 350 kilometres away . We leave right now and we can be back by tonight . Whoa ! Did I just get seconded into this shit ? If you spring rachel from dyad , You will destroy this alliance with delphine . She 's the only person standing between you and topside . I don 't give a shit if delphine 's pissed off ! We 'll know what it says , And she 'll have to work with us . All right , give him the keys . The book might only be about castor . Why bring it into play ? The castor boys are mayflies . I 'm not gonna sit on my hands and wait for them to die , s . Is mark a mayfly to you ? Sorry , gracie . For what it 's worth , he was different from the rest of them . I 'll , um ... I 'll walk you to the bus , love . Felix : If we 're gonna go road-tripping to steal some poor clone 's identity , Then I 've only got one demand , I get to choose the music . Cosima : Chill zone over here . Shay : Very nice . ( laughs ) - Um , protein modelling server , over there . - Mmm-hmm . As I 'm sure you 're aware , Uh , fumigation hood for ... - ( shay mumbling ) - a little of that . - Oh , and scott . - Hi . Shay : Hi , scott . He ... He loves lesbians . - Shay : Oh , he does ? - Well , I ... Can I sequence your genome ? Uh , thank you . Um , but I draw the line at sharing that information with a corporation . - ( whispering ) she 's smart . - Seriously , right ? - Scott : You got my text ? - Yeah . And if sarah 's ready , then I 'm ready . Dude , you rock room wars ? - I play this game with my brothers all the time . - Scott : Really ? - Yeah . - Cosima shreds at it . I 've got a gaming group , bit of a sausage fest , - But maybe you 'd like to ... - Oh , wow . Dr moreau . I love this book . Sorry . Um ...

This is about the sequencing issue We have with the european trials . Okay . Yeah , it 's work stuff . Sorry . Shay : Work , work , work . Cosima : Yeah . Scott : I 'll show her out . You know , my security concerns , they 're not jealousy . I 'm french . We enjoy lovers . Wow . Okay . Look , can we just put our minds together Like we used to And leave the crazy science out of it ? - Sure . - Good . Because this isn 't good news . It can get pretty thick , so you really gotta put your back into it . Sestra alison has good taste . - Yeah , well , she 's very crafty . - In men . Wha ... What ? You have meat on your bones . You 're strong like baby ox . This I like . It 's not usually this thick when all does it . ( in russian accent ) so maybe we need two baby ox . ( laughing ) You are funny man , donnie hendrix . - ( laughing ) - that 's very kind of you . Why don 't you try it , okay ? Be very careful , it 's hot . I gotta talk to my wife . Two babies . ( helena laughing ) ( calculator printing ) Donnie : Alison , we need to finish talking about this . I ... You 've made me lose my place . What ? Helena 's fine . It 's not helena . Jason kellerman kissed you . Donnie , he kissed cosima . He thought it was you . - It wasn 't me . - He thought it was . And maybe you would have kissed him back . Donnie , this is ... I 'll talk to him . I 'll talk to him . I 'll clear this up so that he 's no longer under whatever misconception He 's labouring under ... Gracie : Have a nice day . Look who 's here .

It just ... Everything 's kind of like On the front of my brain right now . It 's like I used to trust people and now I feel like ( voice breaking ) I have to be paranoid all the time . Oh , krystal . Bloody hell . Look , darling . There 's only one thing you need to know . - What happened to your voice ? - Nothing . This is my truth voice . - Oh . - The only thing that you need to know Is that you are one of a kind . You 're a survivor , krystal . And you 're not alone . That is the most completely beautiful thing Anyone 's ever said to me , like , ever . Now I have to go . Take care . Thank you . Great . I feel like shit . We just stole this girl 's identity for bloody rachel . I know . I 'm trying not to think about it . You know , she 's a lot smarter than you think she is . She suspects something . She suspects something big . Yeah . Not being able to put your finger on it , I know that feeling . Well , let 's just get the hell out of here Before we make it worse , okay ? Yeah . Good idea . ( engine turns over ) Delphine : The european team , cutting-edge gene therapists . But duncan only gave us one synthetic sequence to work with , so ... So they failed and she died . Yeah . So no surprise . 'cause we have no idea how any of his sequences interact . Unfortunately for ... - Identity redacted . - Yeah . She 's polish . That 's all I can tell you . Cosima , within the next month You 're going to need another stem-cell treatment from kira . I 'm not doing that to her again . I 'm not going to keep harvesting her . Okay . Then let 's ... Let 's think . How are we going to unlock And identify the rest of the synthetic sequences ? ( mobile vibrates ) Hello . ( stutters ) scott , I can 't ... Slow down . What is it ? What book ? ( sighs ) I 'm proud of you , ali . I mean , you took this place and made it yours . Well , it 's essentially the same , but ... But that 's not why you asked me here . No . No . I thought we should talk about the campaign mixer And , you know ... You know ? No , I don 't . The kiss . The kiss . You want to talk about the kiss ? Yes . Yes . Or we could just kiss . No . No , jason , no . You need to stop this . - I 'm married . - I know . Hey , marriage is complicated . I 'm safe . No one needs to know . No . No . This is a business relationship . If this has become something else in your head , Maybe you 're grasping at something you never had . I did , though , didn 't I ? You need to go . - You need to go . - Okay , ali . But the reality now is that we 're all in bed together And I know you felt something . ( sighs ) Delphine : A code from duncan Which could be the key to everything . I 'm sorry I called her . - It was castor . I panicked . - No , it 's okay . It 's okay . He had your cat . It 's okay . Oh , it 's far from okay . Now castor has this code because you didn 't trust what I would do with it . Did you make a copy of the book ? ( stutters ) no . No . We thought it would be safer not to . Then who else knew about the book ? Because castor knew exactly what they were looking for . Rachel can read it . You went to rachel with this ? - How 'd it go with jason ? - Fine . Fine . It was a misunderstanding like I said . - We 're on the same page . - Are you sure ? If he made any trouble ... Donnie , I don 't want to hear anything about this any more . - Mrs hendrix . - Whoa . Whoa . Whoa . - Hi . - I 'm really sorry . Helena and I need some spare sheets . Oh . You didn 't make up the beds ? - I was a little busy . - Alison : Okay . I 'll show you the linen closet , okay ? ( footsteps approaching ) Oh , my god ! ( stutters ) can I help you ? I 'm afraid you can , krystal . What kind of monster threatens a man 's cat ? More importantly , who is the rat that told castor about the book ? All I know is cosima told us to sit tight . Yeah , but what for ? Why ? ( knocking on door ) Hey . Painmaker . Room wars . Scott 's board-game buddy . - He said to give you this . - ( sighs ) Thanks . Of course we made a copy . We 're not complete idiots . Sarah : Cosima , you sure you want to go through with this ? Delphine may never forgive you . I think it 's a little late for that . I will keep her busy . You get ready to take care of rachel . - ( scoffs ) - all : Bloody rachel . Sarah , you said you wanted to move forward , right ? Well , if this book identifies the rest of duncan 's synthetic sequences , Then we hold the key To my cure , to cloning humans . Us , not them . Your call , love . Delphine : You showed her one page of the book Which mentions castor And then all of a sudden rudy shows up ? You tipped them off , didn 't you ? - How ? - She doesn 't even have the internet . You have nothing to lose . You 'd sell your sisters off to castor out of spite . I should 've let you die . ( mobile vibrates ) It 's cosima . She wants to talk . Come on . Our regular , scott ? Uh , it 's therapy . ( scoffs ) Just one hour and I want you back in the lab . Dude , you rule . It 's like your game life is overtaking your real life . Uh , I think it 's more the other way around . Rachel , wizard . Wizard , rachel . Hey . I shut down four cameras which is so cool . Just make sure you stick to the security route . Thanks . Um ... Can you ... Can we go faster ? - This is top speed . - Right . ( beeping ) There 's a handy van on p6 . Public parking near the smoker 's zone . It 's gassed up and good to go . Do it . ( mobile chimes ) - You 're resigning ? - Effective immediately . ( sighs ) ( whispers ) alison . Alison . Donnie , hey . - Hey , alison texted me to meet her here . - Yeah . That was me . - I get it . - No , you don 't . Because you thought my wife Would skip out and meet you in the stock room . Just like old times . These aren 't old times . These are my times . Your times ? You mean " donnie takes her last name " times ? I got the ring , kellerman . I don 't care what you got . You work for me now , you understand ? If I want your wife , I 'll just take her . Did you just girl-slap me ? You wanna slap ? You want a slap fight , huh ? How 's that , slap ? How 's that , slapper ? You like that , you boat shoe , chino-wearing bitch ? ( both groan ) I may be a bitch , but I 'm alison 's bitch And you 're just a stupid dropout . Shit . Delphine : You don 't quit us . In here you have access , you have control . Out there , what ? You 're just another subject . - Or worse ... - ( scoffs ) what could be worse than this ? You 're self-aware . Any person , any face , any love . Anyone could be a spy . Is that a threat ? Look ... I 'm talking about shay . Oh , my god . This doesn 't have anything to do with shay . Maybe . But how 're you going to know without me ? Delphine , if you 're not going to be with me , If you 're not going to switch sides , Let me go . Scott : Careful , she 's delicate . Yeah , delicate like a spider 's web , aren 't you , rachel ? Mrs s : Well done , scott . Will you look who 's back . Hello , sarah . - Sarah : Krystal goderich . - Nice girl . - Worth 10 of you . - Sarah : Yeah . So you better make this worth it , rachel . You need to translate that , cover-to-cover . Or else we send you back to delphine . Thank you . The day you left for frankfurt , I almost died . Some kind of near-death experience . And it was so easy . I could 've just slipped away . Then I had a vision of you . I came back for you . Why didn 't you tell me ? 'cause you don 't believe stuff like that . So we had to move on . Come here . Come here . I 'm sorry . You should 've trusted me . " in london town we all fell down and castor woke from slumber . " find the first , the beast , the cursed , " the original has a number . " - The original ? - Yeah . - What 's that ? The castor original ? - Maybe . " h-4-6-2-3-9 . " what 's that ? Felix : Oh , shit ! - Sarah , the code . - Shit . Not wise , mrs sadler . It 's quite the sight you two make . Thank you , rachel . You filthy ... Sorry to raise any false hopes . But delphine knew you had a copy . ( stammers ) my book ! My father ... Rachel ? Rachel ! She 's having some sort of seizure . Call a medical team . Nealon , you assured me she could handle them moving her . Sorry , I thought she could . Here 's the copy . It 's no use without her . She 's the only one who can read it . Please . I have to get her to surgery . Should 've made two copies . Yeah . Amateur hour . Delphine was onto us the whole time . The stress was too much for her . She suffered an acute intracranial bleed . I 've induced a coma to control the swelling , but ... She may never recover . - My apologies . - Get back to your patient . We couldn 't give you the book because - If topside had gotten hold of that ... - Topside . Scott lost the book Because someone close to you tipped castor off . It would 've been safer with me . - Where 's the copy ? - Secure . And absolutely useless . You just cost us the one person who could translate it . Your resignation is accepted , and so is yours . - But I didn 't ... - You might need this when you 're out in the cold . Security will see you out . " in london town we all fell down " and castor woke from slumber . " Well it 's not quite chaucer , is it ? - London . - What do you mean ? Well , the bit rachel translated , It points to london . It 's our best lead . ( laughs ) it 's our only lead . To the castor original . Well , if they find him , then they 'll never stop . We need to get to him first . - Yeah . - Felix : Bloody hell . Are we going home ? ( phone rings ) Hello . Rachel : Dr nealon . Rachel , I trust you had a pleasant journey abroad . You did well . Dr cormier has no idea you 're gone . Neither has sarah . You played them perfectly . Take care of krystal . Oh , she 's in good hands . As are you . You 'll wake up with a perfectly matched prosthetic eye . You 'll be your old self in the mirror again . ( doctor speaks german ) ( responds in german ) Thank you , alan . She 's in your hands now , ma 'am . Mrs s : When we find the castor original , There 's only one way this can go . I 'm going to kill him . ( rock music playing ) How much time do I have ? â ™ ª are we going to stay on the floor Now you come to me Because now you believe your girlfriend is a mole for castor . - Ferdinand . - Good afternoon . â ™ ª are we gonna stay on the floor â ™ ª Helena , what did you do ?

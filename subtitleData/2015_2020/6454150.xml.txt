 First impressions ? Looks like it crushed the punter 's throat , held a knife to the madam . She said it was acting angry , just like a human . I saw the forensics leaving . What are you trying to hide ? You 're suspended from duty , active immediately . For legal reasons , a Synthetic appliance cannot self-examine . My clothes must be removed . Yeah . I was afraid you were going to say that . Would you like me to open that for you , Peter ? Tell it to stay out of my way ! Pete ! You 've killed someone , Niska . And they 'll find you . They 'll destroy you . You won 't be allowed to exist . Who is Tom ? Shut up ! Never say that name again ! Do you understand ? Promise me ! You 're a weirdo , Anita . I 'm going to find out why . Oh , my God . She 's here . We can find her . I 'm here ! Help me . Help me ! We are looking for a particular group of Synths . This one again . These Russian junkers picked her up somewhere , they brought her to me . I installed some new software . And I took my fee . Where can I find these Slavic entrepreneurs ? I 'll tell you exactly what I told the other bloke - I 've got no idea . The other bloke ? 20s , dark hair , looked like he was sleeping rough . Him and his dolly were looking for her , too . His dolly hit my mate . Properly . Put him down . Now , how is that possible ? This other young man , are you sure he was human ? You what ? Was he human ? Well , he bled blood . We 're not looking for five Synthetics . We 're looking for four and a human . There 's a young man with them . Must be protecting them . I want him to be the focus now . And those backpacks we discounted ? I want them tested for human DNA . Ripped By mstoll Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . What could you accomplish if you had someone , something , like this ? These machines will bring us closer together . Mmm . That smells good . Oh , Pete , don 't make a call now . Breakfast 's nearly ready . Hello ? Karen , it 's me . Just checking in . How 's gardening leave ? Bored out of my mind . Stuck here until that little creep from the paper drops his stupid complaint . Well , there 's an argument that that 's what happens when you assault journalists . Noted , yeah . What 's happening with the case ? Oh , yeah . Solved it . On to the next thing now . Very funny Could you e-mail me over the case files ? I can 't get access from my home computer , so ... Oh , yeah . That sounds like a good idea . Then we can both be suspended together . - Petel - I 'm on the phone , Jill ! Well , are you going to finish the call - so we can eat together ? - I 'm not hungry . Fine . Well , can you leave , then ? Cos some of us would like to have breakfast in peace . Fine ! I 'm leaving . Anita ? A word ? How are your systems running ? Fine , thank you , Mattie . Yeah ? No errors ? Diagnostics all good ? I detect no errors in my system . I detected a pretty friggin ' big one the other night . You know ? Suddenly switching to kidnap mode ? " I 'm here ! Help me ! " Remember that ? I 'm afraid I don 't . Well , I do . It 's messed up . It 's weird . I guess I wanted to make sure you were OK . On a mechanical level . Obviously . My systems are running at full capacity , Mattie . Thank you for your concern . Yeah . Don 't mention it . Good chat . Hello , Laura . You would make a terrible spy . Whereas you would actually make a pretty good Bond villain . What happened to Anita - the other night ? - Nothing . She malfunctioned a bit . She yelled for help . She yelled for help ? What were you doing ? - Nothing . Why would you assume ? - OK . OK . Don 't jump down my throat . - I might have tried to hack her a little . - Mattie ! She ... She sounded scared . Synths can 't get scared . Can they ? I don 't think so . What would be the point ? - Almost the weekend . - Ugh ! Don 't remind me . Not got anything fun planned with the kids ? Unless you find passive aggression and simmering resentment fun . I 'm a lawyer , aren 't I ? Anything good come in ? Not really . All a bit dry . Ooh , here 's a fun one . Mrs Kennedy was thrown out of a play for violating the theatre 's policy on Synths in the audience . She 's suing for human rights violations . Guess whose human rights ? The Synth 's . - Says her dolly 's special . - Special how ? Says he enjoys the plays , apparently . - Like a real live boy . - Who 's taking it ? Don 't worry , we turned her down . She doesn 't need legal aid , she needs a psychiatrist . Pete ? Can you come in here a minute ? I need to talk to you . Oh . What 's going on ? I 've been thinking . A lot . And I don 't think you make me happy any more . I don 't think that this relationship is healthy for me any more , and I would like some time apart . Jill , I 've been suspended from work , so I literally have to hang around the house all day . How can I spend less time with you ? I don 't think it 's a good idea for you to be here right now . I 'm sure there 's places you can go . This is mad . - I 'm sorry ... - No , don 't apologise . Don 't do that . What 's it said to you ? Simon has had nothing to do with this . Yes , he ... Yes , it does . Ever since we got that thing , this has been coming . - Oh , that 's ridiculous . - Jill , I 'm a man ! I know I 'm not perfect , but that 's the point . None of us are ! We 're not supposed to be ! - Pete ! Pete , no ! - Shut up . Look at me . Look at me ! - Pete ! The deposit ! - Christ ! Leo ... - Are you trying to steal a car ? - No . Borrow one , if anything . What do you want me to do , Max ? Carry you to Mia ? We need to find her . Do you think Mia will be happy to see us ? Who wouldn 't be happy to see us ? Most people we meet nowadays don 't seem to like us very much . Yeah , well they just haven 't had a chance to get to know us yet . The car was unlocked . Yes , thank you , I can see that The coordinates we have aren 't exact . - No . - So , how are we going to find the forum user if we still don 't have their precise location ? Don 't worry about that . I 've got a plan to flush them out . Wait , Toby . May I ? Enjoy the party , Toby . Thank you . They 'll be gone for a while . Sophie 's at a sleepover . Got the place to ourselves . What do you say we have a little house party of our own ? Actually , I 'm going out as well . Where ? It 's a work thing . Last-minute arrangement . Who else is going ? No-one you know . I 'll see you later . Sorry . Anita , do you ever get scared ? I think everyone does . OK , ground rules - if you drink too much , I 'm not carrying you home . Don 't do drugs in front of me . I don 't want to talk to any of your little friends , and don 't try to have sex with any of my friends . - Anything else ? - No , that 's it . Try and enjoy yourself . Yeah , like that 's gonna happen Toby . - Hey , C-Caroline ! - No-one knew if you were coming or not . Do you want a drink ? I 've got some ciders hidden in the washing machine . Of course he does . Yeah , yeah , that 'd be nice . She 's ... a girl in my class . All right , Casanova , enjoy your spin-cycle ciders . Anita ? You 've got access to Laura 's desktop , haven 't you ? Can you check her e-mails ? Calendar , phone ? I 'm not able to access personal information unless requested to by the owner . All right , but the car 's got one of those anti-theft tracking devices , right ? You can tap into that , can 't you , find its location ? It 's my car , Anita , I want you to track it , please . The car is currently driving north on Brooks Street . It 's noisy in here . Do you want to go outside and talk ? I can hear OK . I mean , do you want to go somewhere , just ... you and me ? Just you and me ? Um ... I-I do ... I r-really ... really do , but , um ... but I can 't . Of course you can . No , I can 't . I 'm ... There 's a ... There 's someone else . I-I think I like someone else . Your loss . Yeah . Where is it now ? Edmonds Street . It 's been there for three minutes and 28 seconds . All right , so she 's parked . Where exactly is she ? What house number ? I don 't have that information . OK ... run a cross-check on Laura 's work and Edmonds Street . See if anyone she works with is living there . I can find no record of anyone at Laura 's firm living on Edmonds Street . Is there anyone called Tom living there ? There are three residents on Edmonds Street with the first name Thomas . I 'm going over there . Don 't do that , Joe . You don 't know how this feels . How could you ? You can 't feel . You 've got no idea . At 5.22pm , Laura dialled the landline to a Mrs Alexandra Kennedy and confirmed a meeting at her house this evening regarding her lawsuit . Thank you . I was surprised to hear from you . Your firm told me that I didn 't have a case . Right , yes , they did . We did . I just wanted to do a follow-up , - if that 's OK . - Oh , of course . I wanted to ask you both some questions about what happened at the theatre . Well , we settled down to watch the play . 20 minutes in , an usher comes along and tells me that I need to take Howard out . No Synths allowed . But Howard 's not just " some Synth " . - In what way ? - Well , he understands what he 's watching . Is it true , Howard ? When you watch the plays , what do you feel ? It depends . Sometimes plays are supposed to make you laugh . Sometimes they are supposed to make you cry . All plays are different . This play , then . How did it affect you before you were thrown out ? The story begins when Willy Loman , a travelling salesman , returns to his family home in Brooklyn , New York City . - His wife gets up to meet ... - That 's the plot , Howard . She ... What did you feel ? Sometimes I wish my family came with instructions . Or me . Can you feel awkwardness ? Just as well . I wonder what it 's like ... not feeling anything . It 's got to drag after a while , hasn 't it ? I mean , what about this ? This unlocks you . Makes you ... passionate ? That 's a feeling . It creates the impression of passion . It 's a simulation of an emotion . Yeah , but it 's one of the good ones . As far as I can remember . Do you want to try it ? Just ... out of curiosity ? I mean , we won 't do anything . Obviously . Alex , he doesn 't have any human rights , you know that . Howard doesn 't enjoy the play any more than your wristwatch . He 's just better at convincing you . I 'm not a mad woman . I don 't believe that Howard is a human . But I also don 't believe that he is an inanimate object that I should be ashamed of having a connection with . We created these creatures - they walk and they talk and they look and they smell ... and they become part of our lives and families . They are ... as close to humans as can be and yet still people insist that forming a relationship with them or treating them with dignity is somehow perverse . Well , we 've created a grey area , Mrs Hawkins . We can 't keep insisting that they are just gadgets , they are more than that . We have made them more than that . Rose , mesmerise , summer ... There must be physical contact with my primary user to enable activation . Rose , mesmerise , summer , sapphire ... crush . It 's kicking in . Did it work ? Can you feel something ? Yes . So what happens now ? Anything you want . Could you not take your daughter with you next time ? - Do you have children ? - Yeah . People say the human / Synth relationship is complicated . Howard , sometimes plays are supposed to make you frightened . Do you ever get scared ? I 'm not built to feel fear , Mrs Hawkins . How do I ... turn you off ? Demand it . Anita , turn off adult mode . Delete this from your records . And , er don 't mention this to any ... I don 't give you permission to mention this to anyone . Do you ... Do you need to ... clean up or something ? Yes . May I use the bathroom ? Sure . In 60 minutes exactly , it will be 10 o 'clock pm . I 'm required to turn the volume of the music down to a lower decibel level . Fine ! Danny , didn 't your cousin get her chipped ? Nah , he tried to , but couldn 't do it . - I 've seen her tits , though . - Aw , man ! Now I wanna see her tits . Oh , yeah , mate , go on , do it . My system settings require that any inappropriate touching by a minor be reported to the primary user . My system settings require that ... She 's heavy . Help me . Give it a rest , yeah . It 's weird . Help me get her upstairs . I 'm having a go on it . No , you 're not doing that . What do you care ? Do you think it 's normal to drag an unconscious woman to a room and rape her ? Is that standard party activity for you ? She 's not a real woman . So why are you trying to put your dick in her ? Maybe I just want to try pussy that 's factory fresh for once . You are a nasty little creep . The only thing you 'll be abusing tonight is your own fist . How was your ... work thing ? Oh dead end . How was your evening ? Fine . I 'm sorry we argued . You don 't have to apologise for anything . Er ... I want to take Anita in for a diagnostics check tomorrow . Why ? Because either there 's something wrong with her or me . And I 'd like to find out which . - God ! - Good morning , Pete . Can I ask what you 're doing sleeping in the office ? You 're the detective . You figure it out . Oh ! She , er , chucked me out . It 's over . Maybe she just needs a bit of time on her own . She 's not on her own , though , is she ? She 's got Simon . The Synth . It doesn 't mean she 's replaced you . I 'm an analogue man in a digital world , Karen . I 'm redundant . Things are shit here without you , you know . I have to do all your paperwork , for a start . - Don 't worry , I 've got a plan . - Well , hurry up about it . Why don 't you sleep on my sofa for a couple of nights ? - While Jill gets her head together . - Are you sure ? Yeah , sure . I can see why User 885 was concerned by Mia 's code . They 're late . Maybe they 're already here , waiting . What do they look like ? One 45-year-old man , six foot four , extremely heavy build , big , bushy beard . He 'll be wearing a tight , white T-shirt , denim shorts and a trucker cap . That 's a very specific description . I 'd definitely have noticed him if he were here . So , where is this vast , bearded man ? Have you been stood up ? Yeah , yeah , kind of , yeah . Mm-hm . Hot date , was it ? I was actually waiting for a giant lumberjack stripper , so ... Yeah , well , you never know who you 're gonna meet online . Hu-bot 97 ? User 885 ? Yeah . Cool handle . Sorry for the stakeout . Just trying to make sure you weren 't some psycho . So ... what do you think 's wrong with my Synth . Is Mia with you ? Who 's Mia ? That 's Mia . I thought you were meeting me to help me with my Synth . - I think your Synth is my Synth . - Sorry , dude . We got ours two weeks ago , brand-new . Look at the photo . Yeah , you recognise her , don 't you ? What is this ? Is this a set-up or something ? Look . - Now , tell us where she is . - As fun as this has been , - I 'm going to go now . - No ... - Get off me . - I can 't just let you leave . This is important . She 's important . OK . I 'll help you . Is it OK if I go to the bathroom first , or are you going to wig about that , too ? Yeah , but leave your bag or your phone - or something like that . - Fine . I 'll leave my bag . You 're not being very nice to her , Leo . Leo . If she 's telling the truth and Mia 's been completely wiped ... - Leo ... ... what if we can 't get her back ? - Leo . - What ? You need to look at this . What is it ? Er , why the hell have you got my bag ? That 's my bag ! Freak ! Just a case of downloading her specs and running them through the machine . I haven 't seen one like her before , so she 's a unique . Sometimes they can be buggier than the mass-produced ones . It 's just down to luck , really . What sort of information do you get from them ? Whatever she 's been up to - viruses , apps , hacks , mods - all that stuff . Stuff like ... - passwords , activations ? - We want to know everything that 's been going on with her . Hang on . There 's something funny here . Yeah , that 's weird . When did you say you bought her ? She was brand-new two weeks ago . - What is it ? What 's wrong ? - Well , she 's not brand-new for a start . Your Synth is at least 14 years old . What do you think it means ? I 've no idea . I want you to look up everyone that worked on the Synth project . People on the inner circle . But find someone that 's still around . Someone that might know what this is . There 's a man . Worked on the project in its early years . Retired now . His name is Dr George Millican . George Millican ? George Millican . All right , find out where he lives . I 'm gonna ask him some questions . How 's the arm ? Screw you . What do you want , ex-Detective Drummond ? I wanted to tell you that you 're missing the bigger picture , mate . That brothel murder 's a big story . Bigger than " Policeman hospitalises journalist " ? This might be the single biggest murder case in our country 's history . And I can give you the exclusive story . - So he just dropped the charges ? - Yeah . He must have had a change of heart . Must have done . Well , congratulations ! Good to have you back , Detective Drummond . Thank you , Detective Voss . Spoken to Jill yet ? No . She 'll come round . No , she won 't . It 's done . Anyway ... that 's that . You know what I was thinking ? What if it 's not an isolated incident ? If there are more Synths out there who can kill ? Well , we 're all screwed , then , aren 't we ? Powerful message , ain 't it ? " We are people . " Folks need reminding sometimes . Reminding we 're supposed to be the dominant species . We 're gonna win it , you know . Win what ? The war . What , you don 't believe me ? Here , check this out . Happening tonight . Here . You 'll see . Dr Millican ? Sorry to trouble you so late , but there 's something I 'd like to show you . Dr Millican . You knew David Elster . So did I. You 're too young to have known David . Can we come in ? Vera . This nice young man is from the church . We 're going to need a pot of tea . Hmm . Have you seen this before ? Oh ... Something like it . David ... Dr Elster ... he loved to leave these little secret messages inside his work . There was a Synth from Germany . He had David 's secret recipe for mulligatawny soup in his root code . They sell for 50,000 euros . And Elster did this , did he , personally ? There are collectors who look for this stuff . The code within the picture ... is a separate executable program . You just have to lift it out . Whatever this is , it 's for a Synth 's mind to experience . Yeah , you just plug your pal in here and you 're on the program . Um ... Thank you , er , Dr Millican , we 've taken up - enough of your time already . - Whoa , wait . You 're not going to let me see what it is ? Why did you leave the project , Dr Millican ? David was taking his research in a direction I wasn 't comfortable with . Yeah , sentient Synths . - True Al . - Who are you ? Where did you find this ? If you don 't tell me who you are , I will call the cops . Please , don 't do that . All right . I 'm Leo Elster , I 'm David 's son . Leo died . Yeah . 20 quid if you want to watch . 40 if you want a turn . ... my primary user ... Error . ... my primary user ... You 're up after this one . Follow me . Smash her up ! Smash it , come on ! Which one do you want ? Excellent choice . You can get a weapon from there . Come on , love , mess it up . Go on , get in there ! What are you waiting for ? Get in there ! Come on ! Come on , get in there ! Are you ready ? I don 't understand the question . Hit it ! Hit it ! - It 's humans versus Synths . - I know . Agh ! Get me the police , right now ! No ! Sir ? We 've intercepted a call . A fight in progress at a smash club , some woman kicking off . That 's what smash clubs are for , aren 't they ? She 's attacking people , not Synths . Description ? Could be our girl . Well , right , let 's go . You can go . You can go ! - I 'm sorry ... - Error , my primary user . Error , my primary user . - Error , my primary user . - I 'm sorry . Down here . This way . Don 't break her . What ? Don 't worry . It 's just a message ... from Dad , hidden in Mia . We were meant to find this . It 's not going to hurt me . What did you see ? Life . Stay there ! - I was just thinking about you . - Where are you ? Actually , I 'm in a bit of a tight spot . Can you get out of it ? I 'm not sure I can , you know . I saw something , Niska . My father hid a program in our heads . I think it 's what he used to give you consciousness . Leo , what ? I swear it ! - Do you promise ? - It could be a way to make more of you , but it needs all of us to run it . All of us . So this thing you 're in , are you sure you can 't get out of it ? Not 100 % . Then ... get out of it . Call me right back . Hold your fire ! - Agh , agh ! - Put them down . Put them down . - Agh ! - Now , don 't follow us ... and he won 't die . Remember this . Agh ! Argh ! Arrgh ! Can I help-help-help you with anything , sir ? Help ... What can I help-help ... help you with anything , sir ? Can I help-help-help you with anything , sir ? She 's hiding something from us . - They said she 's at least 14 years old . - You were right . I 'm sorry . There 's something wrong with her . She 's got to go . We 're not getting rid of her . We 're going to keep her . I 'm going to find out what 's going on . Why ? She 's just a machine that 's malfunctioning , that 's all . She 's more than that . Anita ? Who were you before you came here ? I 'm sorry , Laura . I don 't understand the question . I think you do . Thanks . You 're welcome . - Well ... - Goodnight , Pete . Goodnight , Karen .

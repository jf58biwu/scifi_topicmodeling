 As the launch for the first-ever mission to Mars nears , the Space Center , organizes cocktail parties for us astronauts . And as Chief Commander , I am required to attend . Occasionally we run into an old acquaintance or two . Who the hell are you ? So there I was , pressurization to the roof , right ? And the widget hits the metrics component ! You 're our hope , Dave . I must introduce you to Daddy . You also run the risk of bumping into people you 'd rather forget . Hello , Dave . You know each other ? Professor . I hadn 't seen Professor Finger , since my last training medical . And until tonight , I had no intention of ever seeing him again . Assume the position Dave . I 'm going to study your anus , so you can go study Mars . Congratulations Dave , you are now an astronaut . Bon voyage ! Nice seeing you . Bon voyage . Yeah , nice seeing you . Leaving already ? Yes . It was time to prepare for Mars Premium . Space travel , involves intense thought and a well-crafted plan of action . For example , the shopping list down in Youston 's office . Come in . It 's all here , pasta , chips , coke , whiskey , sausage , fries , a bottle of Downy . And for desert ... My flan ! Come now , Dave . You know why flan is not allowed in a zero gravity environment . The molecular structure will liquefied . Nope ! We replaced it with a melon . A melon ? But they 're not in season . We genetically modified it . It its seedless . Seedless ? Goodbye , Dave . Goodbye , Youston . I 'd heard about nervous breakdowns due to flan depressurization , but the fact that Youston would lump me in the same categories as those intergalactic amateurs , was both hurtful and suspicious . I became wary of the melon . Seedless ? If it had no parents , how did it get here ? If it wasn 't born , then it never actually has lived . And if it has never lived ... Well , I 'll refuse to travel with a dead melon . I thought it wise to ask for additional analysis . I want a battery of tests done . Do you understand ? Everything ! Professor ! I 'm picking up signal ! Then , give it a pencil . This melon claims to be the reincarnation of a fashion designer . Hello . Youston here , get down here and try on your new spacesuit . But ... This melon is simply fascinating , he 's so smart , so cultured . The team is crazy about him . The purity of the lines . The audacity of the materials . Fantastich ! This spacesuit is ridiculous , who designed it ? While I was away , the melon had taken control of NASA . I decided to talk to my superior about this . Oh , don 't be so obtuse , that suit fits you like a glove . That 's not the problem ! And while you are here Dave , I am pleased to introduce you to your new partner . Obviously , the melon was in control . And the vocal synthesizer that enabled him to express himself freely , didn 't make things easier . Hi , guys . Your interior designer sucks . What are you doing here ? I 'll have a Cognac , son . He freely imposed his eccentric taste on my rocket ship , my beautiful house . My life . One thought kept me in high spirits . One thing that no astronaut ever escapes . Sorry buddy , we all had to do it . Are you sure ? Next . Doctor Finger 's claws . And don 't forget Professor , this season it 's all about Zebra prints . Thanks for the advice , Melon . You should visit more often , ma ch√©rie . Daddy , I have a life . I can 't assist you . Hey , Dave ! Let 's go , Clara . See ya . Okay . You 're up , Dave . But I don 't have an appointment . Dave . A shiver went down my spine . What did that little fruit tell him ? Wasn 't the Professor sworn to uphold the Hippocratic oath ? And Clara , since when she and the melon became so chummy ? What caused this sudden complicity ? All that tenderness . What was going on ? Hello , Dave . Life is like a shoe box . You never know what you are going to get , until you open it . What are you doing here ? Oh , God . No . No , Jesus , No . Please ! Stop ! No ! No ! No ! Every sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic . Ground Control to Commander Dave . Do you copy ? Ground Control to Commander Dave . Do you copy ? Melon here . I think commander Dave fainted . Youston to Melon , where are you ? Describe your location . Sector B-21 . Near Singularity . Dave to Houston , I copy . God damnit , Dave ! You scared the bejesus out of us . Are you alright ? Do you remember the ending of " 2001 : A Space Odyssey ? " The Kubrick movie ? Yeah , why ? Well . I think I get it . What did he say ? What did you say Dave ? The ending , with the creepy geezer ... Star Child and everything . Yeah . I get it now . Corrected and manually synced , by H @ w-to-kiLL @ subscene .

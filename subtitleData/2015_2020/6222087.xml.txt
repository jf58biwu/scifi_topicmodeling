 Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits ... Go ! ... pitting us against one another . Chester 's Mill sentences Dale Barbara to death . ... and forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons ... rage ... I need to know that you will stand with me against that ! ... grief ... I don 't understand ... who could do this to her ? I promise you , we 're going to catch whoever did this . - ... fear ... - We 're trapped . I hear we 're going to run out of water . You killed Angie McAlister . ... shame . I thought it would bring the dome down . I would do anything to take it back . But we 've also found love under the dome . And we have battled to keep our town together . I thought the dome was supposed to protect us . No , it 's up to us to protect each other . Now we may finally have found a way out . We 're outside the dome . We hope it takes us home , but what if it takes us to an alternate reality ? Whatever 's going down in Chester 's Mill , here 's proof that it ain 't real . These places ... these people ... something is wrong here . What do you say , Red ? Do it . You okay ? Okay , stay close . Watch your step . Here , use your legs . I got you . Come here , don 't put too much weight on it . Is this a joke ? So what are we gonna do now ? I 'm getting so tired of this ... It 's all right . It 's gonna be all right . I just can 't take this anymore . We walked into the white light ... and we just kept going . And the dome was gone . And we were free . The outside world , somehow it seemed more ... more beautiful , you know , more vibrant . Where was I ? You were dead . What did you do after I died ? Julia ... I want to know what it was like for you . There was a funeral , and I met your parents . The only thing I could do was to get as far away from Chester 's Mill as possible . Where 'd you go ? Abuja . Kabul . I ran rescue missions . I dreamt about you every night . Hey , it 's okay . I met a woman . Oh . She doesn 't matter . None of it was real . What happened to your neck ? Your father came back . He brought the egg . - My father did that ? - No . Don 's dead . How ? I think Melanie killed him . How could you even say that ? Because she tried to kill me , too . Found this in an emergency kit . You should eat something . Come on home . That 's your home , not mine . Course it 's yours . I-I don 't know how I 'm back here . You were in some kind of a-a , a-a cocoon , - and-and ... you never went anywhere . - I did . I moved on . I got rid of you . This time has to be different , Dad . I want to forgive you . - For what ? - All of it . Locking me up in that bomb shelter , alone , in the dark . Leaving me up in that tree , forcing me to go get the belt . I saved you . You should be thanking me . You were a weak little kid . I just tried to make you strong . I was stronger without you . Where ? ! In your little make-believe cocoon world ? You 're still weak . You 're pathetic and afraid . You can punch that dome as many times as you need to , Junior . You 're back under it . Three weeks . That 's how long you and I were in those cocoons . Oh , my God . I know . Christine ... the last thing I remember was us finding that egg . And then I was in an alternate reality for , like , a year . In love with Dale , carrying his child . And now we 've hatched and we 're under a dome ? None of this makes sense . We 're anthropologists . But in that world , I was an aid worker . You-you were a therapist . Why were we different ? I can 't tell you that , but ... I think it 's a good thing . If this town knew who we really are , that we were here to find that egg , we 'd have a lot more to answer for . All those hunts Hektor sent us on , do you think Aktaion knew what would happen when we found one ? Tomorrow we 'll go to that town hall meeting - and find out what we can . - No , I 'm ... I can 't see Dale . With her . We have to go . People saw us in those caves . If we don 't show up , they 'll come looking . Is it possible I 'm pregnant ? I don 't think so , hon . It felt so real . It still does . You have always talked about wanting kids . It 'll happen . I guess the best way of explaining it is that we were in a simulated reality . Like The Matrix . Want to hear something weird ? More weird than we were in a Matrix ? I don 't need my glasses anymore . I can see without them . Maybe the goo that was all over us fixed your eyes . Well , yay , you can see , but we 're still trapped inside this hell bubble . Want my sweater ? Yeah . Wh-What are you even doing here ? Uh , I don 't have a house to go to . Can we please go to sleep ? Yesterday we were together . But in the Matrix , you moved on without me . So ... what are we now ? I don 't know . It feels like a year 's passed . And I feel ... different . They 're dead . All of them . Their cycle came to an end . And , unlike you , they won 't be brought back to life . You had a job : lead the people to be cocooned so that the egg could infuse them with the life force . I tried . I did . I 'm so sorry . Why were we chosen to do this ? You and I made first contact with the egg . When we touched it , we gained a complete understanding of the dome 's agenda : survive and propagate . But I touched the egg first . 25 years ago . It should have been me inside the queen cocoon , not you . But you died during the download . Three weeks ago , I came along . From inside my cocoon , I could see that this town was on the brink of destroying itself . What is that stuff ? Oxytocin . It 's a mood regulator . It , plus the alternate reality , was essential to shape these humans into a functioning collective , so that we could gain a foothold . Except ... the transfer of the life force was interrupted . Because Big Jim destroyed the egg . Because you didn 't protect it . Everyone who was cocooned has a role to play . We need to finish what we started . Quickly . Well , I can 't go up there . I 'm surprised Julia hasn 't come looking for me already . I 'll assess the townspeople and determine how much work is left to do . You handle Julia . If she shows up , kill her . - Hey . - Hey , Jim . How are you ? Jim . Hey , there . - How are you guys ? - How are you ? Let 's get this meeting started . Abby . Water ? It 's clean . From my well . It 's good to see you all . Safe . Right back here in Chester 's Mill . You think we 're gonna listen to you , Jim ? You ran this town into the ground . No , Roger , I didn 't . I risked everything to set you free from those cocoons . Because I love this town . And I 'd do anything for it . I 'll get you back on your feet . But first things first . We need answers . For you , for all of you . For my son . The person that has those answers is Melanie Cross . And I won 't stop until we find that girl . He 's starting a witch hunt for Melanie . They 'll kill her before we get any answers . She knows what 's going on in this town and I 'm gonna find out what it is . Forget Melanie . You 're the biggest threat this town 's ever seen . - Hey . - Barbie ! I saved everyone in there ! Barbie ! Enough ! Dale ! Who are you ? Answer the question . Who are you ? I 'm Christine Price and this is my friend Eva . Excuse me , I need some air . And you all know each other ? Yeah . We do . Eva and I were in the ... alternate reality , as strange as it sounds . Sounds pretty strange . Everyone in the cocoons was from Chester 's Mill . But you 're not . No , no . We ... We were here on vacation . We went for a hike in the woods and ... wandered off the trail and ... And then what ? We stepped into some kind of a sinkhole , and emerged from those cocoons yesterday , along with everybody else . When did you go on this hike ? Three weeks ago . That 's some story . I 'm a therapist . I helped this town recover from a trauma ... in the cocoons . It seems as if people could use that same kind of help now ? Shall we ? You 're staying out here . Or what ? Or we tell them everything . Rebecca ... Andrea ... You shot Junior . How you came after me . After all I did for you in those caves ? That doesn 't undo everything else . Chester 's Mill 's still better off without you . Oh , is it ? Cocoons , alternate reality ... Yeah . Looks like everyone 's shaken up . Except for Christine Price . In the cocoons , we were back with our families and now we are stuck here , again , because of you , because of Melanie . You gonna do something about it ? Look , I-I promise you , I 'll find Melanie . All right ? I 'll get us all the answers that we need . What do we do ? I lost my home , too . If you have a house , open your doors . Let 's share what we have . The last time I stood in front of you , I urged you to find strength in community . We all have something to contribute . There 's gotta be wildlife out there . Joe . You can build traps . Or I could help find Melanie . No , Christine 's right . We need to eat . I 'll handle Melanie . Well , isn 't there food at Andrea 's house ? Uh , in the root cellar . Someone can take my car . I 'll go . I 'll go with you . And I 'll set up an office , here in this building . If anybody needs support , come find me . Sam . There 's a lot of overwhelmed people here . Do you think you could start a support group ? Why would I do that ? Your AA experience in the prison . You could apply it here . People in this town see me as a murderer , - not a counselor . - Uh , just ... think about it . And ... do you think you could find your nephew ? I didn 't see him here . She called you " Dale . " Julia , I said I don 't want to talk about it . The woman you had a relationship with is suddenly here , in the flesh . Of course I have questions . Don 't you ? Yeah . I do . About things that really happened . I was in a cocoon , my father 's dead , you were nearly killed and Melanie can answer for it all . We need to find her . So , please , can we do that ? He 's right , you 're weak , you 're weak , you 're pathetic . Oh , just-just-just do something right for once in your life . No ! Go away , Sam . Leave me alone . Go away ! Hey . What 's so bad that you gotta end it all ? Come on . Tell me . The life we had , in the cocoons ? I saw the world . I ... I knew what it was like to be my own man , to be free from my father , and I can 't be back under this dome with him again . I 'd rather be dead . Congratulations , kid . For what ? Hitting bottom . You gotta get here before you 're ready to change . Whatever you found in that other life can help you here . Give me the gun . It works . There 's more supplies in Andrea 's garage . I 'll get them and set up the traps around the property . Do you want to help me ? It 's been a while since we 've wandered around those woods . We 're not here for nature , we 're here to get food . And then we have to take it back and set it up for everyone . First you volunteer to schlep cans , and now you 're throwing a dinner party for a town you hate ? Well ... we 're all in it together . Root cellar 's out back . Come on , Zeta . Let 's grab us some cans of corn . - We 'll meet you back at the car . - Hey . How does he know what sorority you joined ? I ... saw him when we were back at the memorial . I must 've told him . You 're really going to counsel people ? Until someone else steps in . I 've got a PhD in biological anthropology . I know enough to coach people through a crisis . Do we really need to lie about who we are ? We need to keep their trust . We 're trapped here ; the most important thing is survival . When did you become so calculating ? Please . Remember when we found that meteorite in North Dakota ? Who negotiated our exit with that wolf ? We 've been through so much together . We 'll get through this . But first , we got work to do . - What 's that ? - Well , I 'll stay here and try to calm people down . You go find the one thing that could expose us . I ... I don 't even know where to start . We have found the remains of ancient civilizations . I 'm sure you can handle this . She 's not here . That 's where you were . And that 's where I saw Melanie put the egg ... right before she tried to kill me . But you saved her . Protected her . Yeah , and then she turned on me . And you can 't deny what she led you into . Everyone in these cocoons was connected . You and Eva were together for a reason . Oh , here we go . - Now we 're back on this again . - We are . Barbie , I saw the way you looked at her . You were together for what felt like a year . That is so much longer than we 've been together , so I understand if you still have feelings . You were not in one of these things , Julia . You can 't possibly understand any of this . I 'm trying , but you won 't talk to me . You 're different somehow . Did you love her ? I 'm gonna keep looking for Melanie . The tunnel branches off about 30 paces down . I 'll be fine . Git ... Git . It 's better than nothing . Not by a lot . Well , maybe we can find a stockpile of Girl Scout cookies somewhere in here . Ugh . NYC Punk ? I didn 't know Andrea , but she had serious taste in music . It was probably her kids ' . Unless , you know , she also played lacrosse . Hey , look . Before there was Katniss , there was me at summer camp . No TV , no boys , just singing and swimming and sports . Your camp sounds a lot like a sorority with less beer pong . Hey . What 's wrong ? I want it back . That life . I was a part of something , and it felt good . You know ... there 's a way we can feel good right here under this dome . You 're an idiot . You know you want to dance , so come on . No . Just a little head bob , you know ? All right , well , you 're welcome . Let 's keep hunting for grub . The town 's counting on us . " Support group next door . " You 're all here to see Christine ? She offered to help ; we need it . Christine was my counselor while I was in prison . I learned a lot from her . This morning , she asked me if I would lead a support group . You ? Yeah . I 'm not staying . I can 't just tell a bunch of strangers all my problems . Junior , I don 't think you should be alone right now . You have my gun . You can 't babysit me forever . I was giving her a bath . And we were singing a song when it all ended . And I can 't lose her again . Can you survive one hour without your child ? Abby ? That 's where you start . I 'll be here any hour you need . For all of you . Hey , Junior . Excuse me , there 's , um , people in there , waiting for you . Oh , shoot . I was out looking for food . It 's good to see you again , James . We never really met . How you doing ? I 'm okay . Now , how about the truth ? The truth ? I don 't know how I 'm gonna survive here . In that other world , I killed my father , I was ready to burn down his house . That was the life that I wanted ... to be free from him . But ... I 'm here . You were about to make a breakthrough . If you really want to be who you were finish what you started . Drop the match . We are what we do . We are what we do . Julia ... ! Everything started here . You 're okay . Are you okay ? What happened ? I found Ben 's body . His neck was bruised just like yours . He said he saw Melanie in the alternate reality . He didn 't die from an asthma attack . He died because she killed him here . I 'm sorry I left you alone . I think all this was way more real than I wanted to admit . Including Eva . Tell me . I mourned you , Julia . Time passed . And I fell in love with her . And that , with her that feels like yesterday . ♪ Hey , hey , hey ! Andrea . ♪ Hey , hey , hey ! ♪ Back around ♪ I hear you coming back around ♪ ♪ Yeah , you 're rolling like the little sound ♪ ♪ It 's back around ♪ ♪ Hey , hey , hey ... Stop . ♪ Gonna do it , gonna do ... Hey , Davy Crockett . Why 'd you shut the party down ? " Party " ? This is a crime scene . What the hell did you do with Andrea ? She was like that when we got here . We covered her and moved her . You put her outside ? Like trash ? Ever smelled a dead body ? I 've known her my whole life . Even if you guys didn 't , she was a human being . Joe , she would want us to eat . What 's the big deal about us listening to music while we search for food ? You 're right . All right , let 's see what old Thelma and Louise are up to . And we 're rolling . According to the dark flight calculations of the meteoroid and magnetometer readings , we believe we have located the target here in Chester 's Mill . Therapist , my ass . Is it intact ? It 's perfect ! There 's a faint dusting of quartz . Possibly amethyst ? There appears to be some kind of ... energy reserve . Christine , I think you should put it down . Drop it ! Drop it ! Drop it , Christine ! What the ... ? Junior ! What the hell have you done ? I 'm just doing what I have to do in order to move on . What ? ! Christine was right . I needed to finish what I started . Christine ? Let me tell you something . She 's not who you think she is . Those cocoons ? I think she 's responsible . I should thank her . I 've never been happier . This makes you happy ? I don 't feel it . It 's gone . What 's gone ? You . You don 't exist . You 're not my father anymore . Uh ... Shh , it 's okay ! It 's okay . I 'm not like them . I 'm like you ... trapped . Go find your friends . Nice shot . Why 'd you kill it ? It 's what the town needs , Joe . Your leg okay ? I 'm good . Aah ! Looks like it 's just the two of us . Julia ! Aah ! Aah ! Melanie ... stop . I 'm sorry , Julia . This needs to happen . Get off ! Melanie ... I should 've just cocooned you , like the others ! Things would 've been so much better . Are you okay ? What happened ? I was out looking for food and I saw this girl . She , she was strangling Julia . Oh , my God , what 've I done ? ! You saved my life . Guess this is as good a place as any . The place where he died . And where Melanie came back to life . Now we 'll never know why she did that to us . I just need a little time alone . Of course . Hey . I love you , Julia . We 're gonna get through this , okay ? I love you , too . I 'll be back in an hour . I 'll see you back at the motel . Yeah . Overkill for a fishing trip . I 'm getting out of here . You 're leaving town ? Do you know what happens inside a cocoon ? That fuzzy little caterpillar liquefies . And when it comes out , it 's something else . Those people , they 're , uh , they 're not the same . Well , of course they 're not . Think about what they 've been through . No , I mean they 're not the same . They 've changed . Junior , he-he burned down the house , and whistled while it blazed , all dead behind the eyes . He finally stood up to you . I know my son . That 's not him . You think your precious little Barbie 's the same ? - No way . - Barbie and I are gonna be just fine . But you ? You 're run out of town . You do whatever you need to to rationalize that . Listen . I 'm right about them . Just like I was right about everything else . Get out of here . Get out of my boat ! Go home . You ever hear of the designated survivor ? He goes off on his own when the ... president and all the bigwigs are doing the State of the Union . Well , bud , that 's you and me . We 're gonna be out there on Bird Island . James was the closest ... a seed , ready to sprout ... once he shed his fear . With the right amount of nurturing , Sam could be next . They came when I signaled , without knowing why . The life force has taken root . Some are compelled to serve their duties . Some will require cultivation . Others must be pruned away . Weeds are stronger than they seem , a threat to what must blossom . But , with careful tending , this kinship will grow into what we need it to be .

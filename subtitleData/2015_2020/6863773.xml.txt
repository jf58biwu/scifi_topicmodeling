 We have a follow-up report from live at the scene of today 's armed occupation of the East Asian Economic Federation 's Far East trade embassy . Major Kusanagi . Special Adviser Fujimoto . Lt. Col. Kurutsu . Ambassador Wong . Our interview is just a formality . These days AIs and administrators do the deliberations . Won 't this conversation affect the outcome ? Humans need not be daunted by machines . Your unit aligns perfectly with a critical governmental problem . change took the world by storm . This country is no exception . The war accelerated cyberbrain and prosthetic development . but the real problem is more fundamental . The cyberbrain and prosthetics businesses spawned the largest profit-seeking system in history . The massive amount of data now shared in real time has gone beyond what any country can manage . the state 's role isn 't over yet . Yes . which is the foundation of the state . Fall back ! Cyberbrains and prosthetics are the bridge connecting the systems of munitions industry and household economics . Government regulations are meaningless at this point . that doesn 't mean it transcends laws established by the state . Systems which break the law must be taken care of directly . Informatization forces us to choose between becoming the system and subordinating ourselves to it . What we need now is an executive organ to offensively pass judgment on the system . ... is a network to integrate with the system and sort people appropriately . Lt. Col. Kurutsu . Anti-terror activities under direct governmental authority . State-of-the-art cyber investigation . The power to bring charges for corporate crimes . Nothing is taboo for your unit . Major ? In a few minutes . What 's the sitrep ? it 's a circus over here . Dammit ! It 's Ape-Face from Public Security Section 9 . Isn 't Chief Aramaki the one that requested us ? He wants us working for him . That doesn 't suit our separatist leader . The ape 's assumed authority . Major ? Want me to break into Section 9 's Net ? I 'll negotiate . Just wait for me . The Prime Minister would like to see this incident resolved promptly . And you 've just been given the authority to do it . sir . Do you like this country ? at least . then . I 'll begin immediately . and ... Sir ? Your smile is too perfect . You don 't need to devote so much of your prosthetic memory to it . sir . I have no intention of questioning your soul — your Ghost . I 'm heading to the scene . Good luck . information . I see a report from federal council session 320 approving the budget . Major . Get in my lobby . We 're taking this case . Kusanagi . I didn 't expect to see you here . Did you come to wag your tail for our antiquated government ? And you ? Kurutsu ? Most of the military is going to be privatized . This is a war . and you have no future . The war is over . too . Everyone is replaceable and expendable . We 'll soon find out which of us is the disposable one . ETA seven minutes . I assume you have my info . Eleven soldiers who opposed downgrading Defense from " Ministry " to " Agency have occupied the East Asian Economic Federation 's Far East trade embassy . and affiliations . Um ... and two of ' em have heavy-class converted prosthetics . Nothing the riot police oughta fool with . 36 are confined in the hall with the bombs . The others are higher-ups who escaped into the panic room . They 're probably the real targets . we 're screwed . They 'll either hole up in there for a year or start staging public executions . What are their demands ? They want the government to keep the Ministry and suspend military trials . They didn 't ask for their own escape . They just want their own little battlefield . Execute domination on my signal . We 're going in . just the seven of us ? ! and Logicomas for shields . The riot police at the perimeter will keep enemy reinforcements away . You need anything else ? Seriously ? Guess the rookie can 't do anything without a textbook and a necktie . being the only one with a natural body . Why not take this chance to go full cyborg ? I 'll call your pretty wife for you . I can at least collect your last words before your cyberbrain 's blown away . Call me if you want someone to make your death painless . Screw you jerks ! I 'll do it and show you all ! You 're top-notch parts I collected . I 'll purge you . But most of you would wind up in jail or shot in the back if you weren 't on my squad . Don 't forget that . Get in position and prepare to go in . She 's calling us machine parts now ? Our naive princess probably meant it as a pep talk . Downright evil . Crazy bitch . She 's a cruel mistress . It just means she trusts us . I seriously might get killed . We need more personnel to storm them ! Where 's Special Forces ? Where are the Rangers ? ! Everyone refused to come . They don 't want to shoot their own people to save some foreign war merchants . Tell them to help these guys by stopping them from committing more crimes ! Any squads associated with them will be charged with conspiracy ! Chief . Major ? but you 'll need to stand down . so that suspicious squad budget the council just passed was yours ? It 's not like you to rely on politicians . I saved myself some hassle by negotiating with the top . " Directly under the Prime Minister " only means something on paper . I recommend a squad that follows international law . I think you said ? We 'd already have one if it weren 't for the war . and stop incidents like this before they happened . but I 'll take this case over your fantasy squad . When are you going in ? In 20 seconds . so you 'll have something to do afterward . She 's like a kid with a new toy . Dominate now . Our comm lines just got dominated ! I like a good opponent . Bring it on ! My sights ... She 's infiltrated my vision ! what 's wrong ? Hello ! Bastards ! protect the hostages . Order acknowledged ! Are you my prey ? Move it ! Don 't give up the hostages ! Do whatever it takes to buy time ! Hello . See ? I contribute . dammit ! Where are you aiming ? Don 't kill them ! Don 't monitor my vision all the time ! Break your kill shot habit . The war is over . Tell that to the people still fighting it . Die ! Bummer for you . Guess your conversion was all about might . you felt like you 'd become the best you 'd ever been . too . Major . How 's the panic room ? The door 's fine . Two men on the move . Batou and I will box them in . Free the hostages and put everyone you 've captured in the hall . too ? You like playing the clown ? we 're fine . Seven people stealing the perps we used 200 to surround ... Now that 's entertainment . Mr. Prime Minister . I 'll issue a directive . Batou ? Major ? Where 's the enemy ? what 's going on ? I was jammed for a second . There 's a twelfth person on the property . A twelfth ? Find them ! Look . Friendly fire ? everyone outside ! Something 's off . We 're one person short . There 's been some noise on the comm line ... don 't touch those ! The hostages ' cyberbrains are contaminated ! This pattern is ... The false memory virus . It 's Fire-Starter ! Give them the virtual vaccine ! I thought they were ghost locked ! Why can they move ? ! I found the twelfth perp ! They 're the host for the packaged virus . Destroy their cyberbrain ! It 's been a while since I got permission to kill . wait ! My ear ! That was a flesh part ! I 'll kill that bastard ! This is horrible ... A false cyberbrain ... This is just a remote-control doll with no Ghost ! Where 's the twelfth perp ? I lost track . I 'm searching now . A governmental state of emergency alert ? Secret talks at Yagasaki Hotel ? Bombing ? What the hell are you talking about ? ! Who died ? ! The first assassination of a sitting Prime Minister in our nation 's history happened while Japanese soldiers occupied an East Asian Federation embassy . but authorities requested an analysis of the Ministry faction 's military Nets from Vice-Minister Kitahara Youko in her interim role due to the Minister 's resignation . increasing the bad feeling between government and military groups . Which of us is disposable ... Did someone use you and throw you away ? Kurutsu . The PM 's talks were with Ambassador Wong from the Far East trade embassy . Investigate the simultaneous embassy occupation without making any assumptions . sir ! Find out what 's been going on at the PM 's residence . Put surveillance on anyone who makes noise about their immunity to arrest . sir . We should have stopped this from happening somehow ! All patched up ? Amazing what having a budget will do for maintenance . though . Give me two hours to fine-tune . I 'm gonna blow the brains out of whoever shot me ! Saito . You 're the only one who saw her . I 'll do both ! Major ? you 're on the bomb site . Figure out whether this was an operation on two fronts . What about Kurutsu and company 's cyberbrains ? They 're too damaged for me to read . I 'll investigate her death and the virus . Let 's say the chick with your body model unleashed the virus . Can I kill her ? Do corpses give us info on the ringleader ? idiot . then ? They oughta be halfway around the world by now . they 'll have operatives in our government who can 't move right away . there 's a third party who used these guys and then iced them . I 'll pray they 're foreigners . I 'm sick of killing my countrymen . Do background checks on everyone . Don 't get tripped up by petty spy battles . Special Adviser Fujimoto ... I came for the DNA testing on his body . after all ... I promise to find the culprit . I can 't even remember yesterday . Or what Father and I last talked about ... on the battlefield . Did your memories come back ? All of them . I 'll never forget again . he issued some kind of directive to me . But someone jammed the signal . Please ... I want you to tell me his last message for me . and ... Could we have dinner sometime ? Pardon ? if that 's all right . There aren 't many restaurants I can go to . I assume you heard . Yep . I 'll find evidence . too ? Get the perps ' Net and don 't do anything uncalled-for . Who tries to pick up women the day after his dad dies ? Not to mention the Major ! They probably hit it off from the start . Rich third-generation politicians don 't meet her type every day . old-timer . Can 't waste our new authority . It 's been 900 hours since I last saw someone move . but I didn 't realize it would become an automated factory . Everyone went to work for Harimadara . What did you want ? A factory tour ? Why was Kurutsu at that meeting ? For profit and survival . Ambassador Wong and the PM were working on an agreement to avoid a prosthetics development dead end . To keep production lines going by deliberately delaying technological improvements . Doesn 't the government give research grants so that development won 't dead-end ? It 's the opposite . Most of the existing prosthetics will be impossible to upgrade within the next generation . Others weren 't full cyborgs from birth like you . Dr. Kusanagi . So you 're making parts here ? to keep us alive . while a technological revolution means control of an enormous market share . and was annihilated by the latter 's system . That makes a strong motive for the perp to kill the ambassador and the PM in the same hit . Thanks for telling me . You should say hello to your parents . Another time . Come whenever you like . they 're not going anywhere . former Army armored division signal man . Would a military Net admin really hole up here ? he did . Logicoma . I see one person 's heat signature . And nobody 's dead ? My investigation doesn 't go that far . Dead men tell no tales . or we 're back where we started . You 're a dangerous guest . Learn to shut your door . I thought someone might come to speak with me . Did you need something ? I presume ? We 're part of a special squad . We 'd like to ask you a few questions about the Prime Minister 's assassination . What 's that data ? Soldiers ' last words . so they only send their dying messages . They automatically send to me after they kill themselves . an admin they 've never even met . I wish they 'd at least come talk to me ... Is someone dead ? yeah . You stand by until we get back . Okay ! Get any transmissions that hinted at the Prime Minister 's assassination ? Not once . though . Are there any you 've lost contact with ? Plenty . I 'll forward you a list . Anybody you figure was in command ? Army Colonel Nada Haruyoshi would have had the most clout . but he disappeared before the incident . too . Why me ? Most suicides are full cyborgs . so they fall apart while still alive . Like me . too . this is what prosthetization dooms you to . What did you do with the dead person ? We couldn 't do anything . I recommend recovering his data ! You can 't recover his life or his Ghost if he 's dead . What a badly designed unit . Mr. Batou ? but I wound up a full cyborg instead . Are you working as one of the Major 's parts so that you can die ? now ! A stud like me doesn 't die too easily . Got it ? Yes ! Thank you for another valuable learning experience ! Request it through Foreign Affairs . We 're victims here . I won 't allow you to " strip them of military affiliation . I want compensation from the government . That " victim " is trouble . the Far East Trade Representative . He 's also an infamous fixer . but he weaseled his way out of it . he might be attacked again . He 's probably got a lot of secrets he doesn 't want exposed . Makes me want to know who arranged the PM 's secret talks . And who leaked their location . Tell the Major I 'm always open to a joint investigation . just as they are for cyberbrains and prosthetics . No country relinquishes its borders just because national boundaries give rise to technology gaps . Lt. Col. Kurutsu and I were trying to find the way to the next epoch . Deputy Director Amagata ? That 's no longer my title . Kurutsu told me the same thing — that a day was bound to come when cyberbrain Nets would transcend even corporate borders . That 's a long way off yet . I recommend our protection and monitoring . That 's not necessary . Your former colleagues will protect my company . Major . You 've got the info ? but I did find a data transfer from Kurutsu . automatically sent one minute after the blast . either . Give me the address . I 'll go . all the members of the 501 are corporate employees now ? Or are you research subjects ? Kusanagi . Instructor Ibachi . We 'll get justice for Kurutsu . Don 't involve yourself any further . not even backed by a developmental organization . and I really will take you out this time . Keep tabs on everyone at Harimadara from the 501 . Expect them to obstruct our investigation . Roger . They probably want to retaliate anyway . I found the plan for averting dead ends in some government docs . There 's a security plan set up based on what happened over 20 years ago when they tried the same national policy . Security ? What happened ? A ton of people went missing . At the top of the list are a prosthetics researcher and his pregnant wife . They were last seen at the site of a chemical weapons explosion . Some organization is keeping their bodies for research ... Are you listening ? I 'll have my AIs analyze the data . Find out the connection with these crimes . They tell me you 're with another unit now . We have more non-military companies interviewing here recently . Now we foster a broader range of personnel . Are they good purchases for the corporations ? The point is that we can promise these children a future . They 're over there . Hello . What 's your name ? Chris . I 'm Kusanagi Motoko . I used to live here . Do you feel nostalgic ? I suppose it does bring back memories . Do you know Kurutsu ? Everyone here does . She was going to build a future for us . But she died . May I listen to her message ? Yes . it means I 'm no longer of this world . and duties I 've assigned you . but there is a future . we 'll meet again one day . Third World " ? but of data . Do you believe that there 's someplace we can go even if we become unable to swap prosthetics and we can 't go on living ? That 's not something I know . Is this the only message ? Yes . Will we meet again ? Good idea . Let 's . Why meet up to talk ? Are you implying my cyber lobby is bugged ? you know ? What are you talking about ? You 're the one who chose to bring this flesh guy into our unified-spec team . Our rookie 's afraid you might secretly be a robot . I didn 't go that far ! I just want to deepen our understanding and trust — He says this is a terrible working environment : and no cherry blossom viewing even though it 's spring . I didn 't say that ! about the Ministry faction ... all left the same testament . and they 're likely to strike again . and it 's a weird one . He said he 'd " received a gift from the Third World . Doesn 't that mean he got the virus from the broker ? No ... It 's weird . Third World " ? Is this some occult thing ? Find out if anyone at the Ministry of Defense or affiliated companies uses that phrase . dammit . I will if I find optimal parts . Calling us parts again ? Got a problem ? The rookie says you 're a crappy leader who talks about people like things . I didn 't go that far ! Major . it was an RMC . not a human sniper . and remote-controlled a body at the same time ? That 's not the Major 's body model — that 's the Major ! Just makes me wanna kill her more . I keep sensing someone watching me . What a coincidence — so do I. actually . Ape-Face from Section 9 ? this feels different . I found something that 's probably related . and I 'll show you something interesting . What 'd you wanna show us ? I used a forensic search to reproduce the movements of objects caught in the blast . This is pyro reverse measurement — it 's like replaying the explosion backwards . Pretty amazing . The case with the bomb in it used fingerprint recognition . Only the Prime Minister or his aides could open it . A surveillance cam ? but it 's got a limited range of transmission . I did random testing with some white noise . This is cheap encryption by AI . I 'm connected to our Peeping Tom 's Net . I want your name and outfit ! my assassin 's itching to kill someone . Section D ! Contact them ! He 's on loan to Foreign Affairs from Public Security . They 're involved with the PM 's secret talks ? Treaty Review Department section leader . Give me the short and sweet explanation . We captured her on camera a month ago . and false memories ... She 's the seller . A crazy bitch who goes by the same name as the virus . and you fell into her trap . since we have the same body . You 're a fool . You 're a super-wizard-class hacker . I 'd be stupid not to suspect you . It was two officers that she manipulated . Officers ? People who helped implement the PM 's established policies . One of them was Colonel Nada Haruyoshi . The one who went missing before the incident ? His job was to isolate the radical elements within the Ministry faction . And then he up and pulled the trigger on a two-pronged terrorist attack ! It 's like he had a personality transplant . He was infected by the virus . though ? Enemies of the PM must have bought the virus at auction . and get hold of them and the broker . Who was the other officer ? Vice-Minister of Defense . Wh-What 's the meaning of this ? ! Don 't move ! You protocol-ignoring scumbags ! You 're under arrest for unlawful investigation ! Knock it off . I ... never expected this ... Let 's hear your story . and she induced the Ministry faction 's flare-up . laying off several thousand troops in the restructuring . Was she involved in the PM 's assassination ? Not that we 've discovered . So a Foreign Affairs squad and the backbone of the MoD got used in a plot to assassinate the PM . The virus itself hasn 't been found . If it 's all this woman 's scheme ... I saw this from the cyberbrain infringement stage . I 'm aware that I 'm a victim . Who orchestrated this to make this look like my set-up ? Excuse me ? ! is he ? head of intelligence 's strategy office . He 's after the broker who could be your twin . Aramaki ! So it was the intelligence bureau that outbid the treaties bureau for the virus ? I 've got nothing to do with the treaties bureau . and she got away from us before we could secure the virus . I 'll pretend I believe that . Right now we need everyone working together on this . Major . An organization that locks up witnesses to protect itself deserves to be punished along with the perps . You 're just some upstart rogue squad ! so you can have something to do afterward . Fire-Starter . They 're nuisances . Can 't you take them over with your virus ? No need to panic . of all . Simply taking advantage of people 's patriotism isn 't a foolproof plan . We should eliminate any possibility of them tracing this back to us . That will cost you . Kusanagi Motoko ... when shall I steal your name ? Prime Minister Fujimoto definitely issued some sort of directive . And our only related lead is that Vice-Minister Kitahara remembers a ghost ship of unknown origin off the coast of Niihama . Nada 's hideout ... And yet intelligence isn 't making a move . If Nada 's infected like the treaties bureau says ... Odds are ten to one it 's a trap . The ship 's likely location is near a cluster of undersea cables . Could be a spy vessel . thanks to intelligence stealing Kitahara from us . Now what ? We find out the rest by taking over the ship . don 't you ? Quit the squad if you 've got doubts . Everything ties back to the PM . or back out now ? Let your Ghosts decide . yeah ? Not a bloody battlefield or a tight corner to die in . if nothing else . Just stand by . We don 't know what we 're facing . An offensive unit with top priority ... but nobody 's made it a reality ... Until now . No sign of anyone on board . Incoming ! They 're pulling out the tanks from the get-go ? ! I knew I should 've stayed home ! Saito ! I can 't pick them up ! Shit . That 's type-2902 thermo-optical camouflage — Kyo-Re 's newest release ! How much capital would it take to get that for your tanks and your troops ? I 'm taking the ship . Cover me ! exactly ? ! rookie . Go ! Major ! I 've reached the intermediate security server . I have eyes on the barrier 's gate array . It 's a variant on Army tactical defense barriers . but only one exit ... This 'll be a pain . Opening a tunnel . it 's full of null data . They 're giving me the slip ! This fake looks familiar . The real data is on the other side of the nulls . I 'll look for a way around . I don 't want to wait . I 'll just force it open . The broadcast van 's active protection burned out ! Close the connection ! Too late ! What ? how many hidden servers do you have ? I don 't storm a place unarmed . I 've taken control . The info — What is this ? and 7 lost . Number and positioning of enemy troops unknown . They 've taken our fire-control room ! I 've got him . too . Hit the deck ! Another one ? ! Mr. Batou ! Stop ! When are you gonna get a cockpit ? ! The request is being processed ! Military restructuring ? Why my team ? Who the hell — So that 's how it is ? Major ! Major ? ! what the hell 's going on ? ! I know we took over the ship . Somebody 's remote-controlling these from nearby . Saito ! Find them and kill them ! Give me more intel ! That bitch ! you 're good . You can work for me when she 's dead . Dammit . guys ! Why isn 't anyone shooting at us ? Isn 't their goal to recapture the ship ? Everyone all right ? Major ? ! What the — Did she use Ghost infiltration keys ? She assembled us by force . so I 'll make this brief . I 'm redoing the investigation with a new hypothesis in mind . There 's no need for us all to bear the risk . Major ? It 's not her . Just projected data . I just declared this squad disbanded . Say what ? ! I 'll leave recommendation letters with Chief Aramaki . Choose for yourselves where you want to transfer to . You 're top-notch parts . you perform better than I could alone . That 's all . Obey your Ghosts . Her lobby 's been shut down . She purged herself . She might 've just cut us off . It 's messed up either way . My ghost lock ain 't working ! A remote-controlled body ... Was Colonel Nada captured ? You 're upset that the hearing was indefinitely postponed ? I don 't even know what the truth is myself ! I 'm not upset . Send the repair bill to the Ministry of Commerce or the Far East trade embassy . I 'm borrowing another car . Fire-Starter " ... or is it your own name ? Is there a difference ? just like you asked . What more do you want ? ! We don 't know whether Kusanagi is dead or alive . Search your Net for her . Cooperate ... Or else the biggest scandal since the war is going public . 337.333 ) \ fscx188 \ fscy188 \ frz15.16 \ fax-0.21 \ fnMermaid \ fsp1 \ b1 \ shad7 \ cH999897 \ 4cH302F2E \ blur2.5 } S { \ fax-0.23 } e { \ fax-0.26 } c { \ fax-0.28 } t { \ fax-0.3 } i { \ fax-0.32 } o { \ fax-0.35 \ 4cH434140 } n { \ fax-0.39 } 9 { \ fax-0.44 } O { \ fax-0.46 } f { \ fax-0.48 } f { \ fax-0.51 } i { \ fax-0.53 } c { \ fax-0.55 } e 337.333 ) \ fscx188 \ fscy188 \ frz15.16 \ fax-0.21 \ fnMermaid \ fsp1 \ b1 \ cH999897 \ 4cH302F2E \ 1aHB4 \ blur10 } S { \ fax-0.23 } e { \ fax-0.26 } c { \ fax-0.28 } t { \ fax-0.3 } i { \ fax-0.32 } o { \ fax-0.35 } n { \ fax-0.39 } 9 { \ fax-0.44 } O { \ fax-0.46 } f { \ fax-0.48 } f { \ fax-0.51 } i { \ fax-0.53 } c { \ fax-0.55 } e and Colonel Nada is still status unknown . and you 've also lost your investigative privileges .

I 'd look into anybody involved who refuses to testify . the Far East trade rep . He 's a formidable opponent . Use Section 9 's Net . sir ! What you cultivated is starting to thrive . Major . There was this intel ... went MIA during the old project to avert dead-ending . I just did some digging . Their bodies are being kept by Unit 501 for research purposes . You better not tell me the wife was pregnant . What are you talking about ? Someone who 's been a full cyborg since birth . They 're the Major 's parents ? I can 't be sure . The bodies are so contaminated they can 't even be ID 'd . and raised as Army equipment . It 's not that she has nothing to lose ... It 's that she never had anything she could lose . you 're saying ? So your take is that those vics who might be her parents are the reason she 's gone rogue ? This is the Major . They 're probably secondary to something bigger she 's after . but I think she saw something real bad on that ship . Bad enough to make her purge all of us . that 's a laugh . She calls us " parts " ! but she doesn 't treat us like things . really . or fall apart while you 're still alive . Where are you going ? I 'm not the type to obey my Ghost . What I can see with my own eyes is all there is . and seven infantrymen . That was one expensive trap . What were they looking at ? I came to talk . Sorry for asking you here out of the blue . I hear you want to work for us again . I 'll consider it . You 're the one doing the talking . My role as a relay point ... is ... formerly of the Army 's armored division . That name matches one of the Ministry loyalists who died yesterday on a spy ship of unknown affiliation . I ... You 've been implanted with false memories ...

Uesawa Electrical Engineering do you think you can get away with making enemies of your old unit ? ! 000-fold . It takes them five minutes to reach your cyberbrain . It ain 't the kind of thing you can withstand . Stop ! Stop ! From the inside ? ! Get in ! The East Asian Federation bigwigs and the cyborg with the Major 's model have been together from the beginning . That rules out a terror strike on two fronts . Why were you at the embassy ? I managed to play back a scrap of the data from that oversized e-paper at the bomb site . A 3D map of the embassy ? Then the point of the PM 's secret talks was ... The ship was being used for domestic espionage under a secret deal with the Americans . Forget a scandal — this is a national security issue ! But you gave it up . Why go so far to set up the Major ? Who 's the Prime Minister 's enemy ? ! The PM wanted to use the Defense Ministry faction to oust the rebels in the Ministry of Commerce . That 's all I know ! give me the antidote ! idiot . He 's Colonel Nada ? Maybe his sympathy for the rank and file spawned his false memories . You think the host 's desire and guilt form the core of the false memories ? And they left him alive as a card to play when they wanted to intimidate the government . Unbelievable . Representative Lee took over a rare earth mine that had been under Wong 's jurisdiction . but they were competitors . This is all about war merchants trying to crush each other . The PM must 've helped with the Ambassador 's plan to kill the Representative . And the Representative counterattacked . Our broker provided both sides with the virus . Probably playing a double game . this was a war between the PM and the Federation ! Got it . Someone 's ordered the Major 's arrest . Where are you going ? Even the Major decided to go this one alone . I know you guys won 't act . Don 't underestimate me . I 'll leave the Major to you . Do not let her die . Major Kusanagi ? Section 9 told me to call them if you showed up . You want to keep this secret even from them ? Special Advisor Fujimoto . You carried the enemy 's bomb to your father . God ... One more thing . My squad 's budget — I couldn 't trace some of it . Where did that money come from ? I think it 's a surplus ... from privatizing a military wing ... From breaking up a post called Unit 501 . put my memories back how they were ! I can 't bear these memories ! I choose the truth . no matter how much my heart might wish it . Never again . A remote-controlled body ... Kurutsu ! Show me to the server floor . A virus development Net ... It 's transmitting externally ? ! An attack barrier and a barrier maze . Clearly that info is something worth protecting to you two . I see . but we 're going to restrain you . On Kurutsu 's orders ? it 's our collective will . Kurutsu is only one part . Then she is alive . Kusanagi . We don 't want to see you killed . That 's enough . Kusanagi . Outcast . Out of my way ! Kusanagi . Major ! Yo . Awake now ? I cracked your secret lab to use it . No complaining . It ain 't like you to lower your body 's functionality with implanted weapons . Why did you come ? but as a human with a Ghost I wanted to give you the choice " ? Run . once you 're out of the maze . we 're gonna do our own thing . I hope you can take responsibility for this ! Don 't worry . I 'll use members of the unit . I 'll have my subsidiaries give you soldiers . Go through as many as you like . You don 't mind battlefield-level casualties ? Not when a 500 billion dollar deal is on the line . Fools out to change the world are a minority group . Isn 't getting rid of those fast what your " democracy " is all about ? Kusanagi . We don 't want to see your brain fried . My barrier isn 't that cheap . To think you reverse-breached the barrier ... There 'll be no going back for any of us . Tell me the real Kurutsu 's location and objective before that happens . We don 't know her location . Her having multiple bodies was top-secret . Her objective is the same as ever : survive no matter who wins this . but the East Asian Federation 's goals are technological revolution through dead-ending and market monopoly . Some children aren 't facing a dead end yet . You 'd turn them into merchandise ? ! to whom we should leave everything . They will become next-generation models and make long-term upgrading a reality . And you 'll make them repeat all this ? Sell even their Ghosts ? ! you ... You were always free . Constantly trying to create a future . We envy you for that . You protected me ? ! Our brains are at their limit anyway . We 'll shift to the Third World before they expire . Pray that we become part of the sea of data . someone may be born who accesses you . There ! Saito ! How dare that bastard screw with me ? ! everybody alive ? you know ! We studs don 't die ! Why are you just standing there ? I 'll replace you if you don 't perform better . you damn maniac . Major ! You outcast scum ! are you all right ? am I right ? you thrill-seeking idiots . You 're the kind of parts I won 't be able to collect again ! We 've got an important job still undone . What good will arresting me do ? The same game will just start up again after this administration dissolves . but I won 't let it happen . We 've used money and technology to fight an unscrupulous system . It 's no different from you with your guns . We hate crime . You breed criminals for the sake of profits . You 'll understand one day . That 's where you 've been ? You 're late . She 's just leaving . Kurutsu ! Kurutsu is dead . I can 't behave with the same personality again . It 's a mystery even to me . How long have you been doing that ? Since the beginning . I 've operated many prosthetic bodies . But you 're the only one whose name I couldn 't use . And Fire-Starter ? Were you the developer ? and the birth of a new world ... I 'm going there ... Going where everyone else is . remaining in a world like this when you were once freer than anyone . Did you get to say goodbye ? Why did you use her ? Two possibilities existed to avert the dead end of cyberbrains and prosthetic bodies . You and she were those possibilities . That 's all . Take him . You should stop searching for the names of the dead . There 's nothing to be gained . Take it from someone who 's spent a long time as one of them . What is it ? Won 't you take us with you ? Where should we go ? ! What do you want ? To gain uniform standards by selling your bodies and Ghosts and sacrificing those who were given nothing ? You all have cyberbrains . You have Ghosts you should be obeying . You seek more than that from other people — what do you plan to offer in return ? Build a future . It 's just the government 's " official position . It doesn 't conflict with our trade . Excellent . the aristocracy state starves . The slave trade benefits from labor shortages . Major ? and some union officials . How dare you ? The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Defense Agency are watching this . I 'll have Vice-Minister Itou here testify in a court of law about the Prime Minister 's assassination . I 'm ruined ... Impossible . He applied for asylum and was accepted . He even signed the written oath . When ? ! I don 't have to answer that . The papers are at the embassy . I 'll forward them to you . The previous Prime Minister 's wishes survive . You 'll be assassinated . pacifist nation . is it ? Outside the window ! Help !

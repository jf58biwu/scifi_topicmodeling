 Alpha Tango Echo 53 . Clean up complete . Alpha Tango Echo 53 , permission to return to HQ approved . Rabbit Hole out . The Pyramids , Stonehenge , the Great Wall ... Would 've taken massive amounts of people communicating with each other , and even agreeing with each other to build those ancient wonders . We believe they used this biological substance to control humans . If we look at worker ants , they work together , building tunnels , gathering food , defending their territory , using what 's called swarm intelligence . See , ants are given very simple tasks . But together ... They can ... they can solve major complex problems by just communicating with each other , using their senses , pheromones , sounds , touch . How do humans work together to use this swarm intelligence ? Why can 't most men think with their brains when they wanna get laid ? Hmm . Hunger , thirst . Those are basic needs that can be quenched on your own , right ? But there is one fundamental desire that cannot be fulfilled if you were stranded on a deserted island . The feeling of being alone . Hmm . Social connection is essential to survival , and they impart that fundamental need and make you feel that what you 're doing is both ethically and morally correct so that you won 't resist it , you won 't even question it . No logic , no reasoning , no emotion , nothing can overpower this altered reality they put you in . You speak of " they . " Who are " they " ? Mark Maris , please report to B7 . Will Mike Maris please report to B7 . Jim , can I see you in my office for a sec . Yeah , sure . Ah , come on in , Jim . Grab a seat . Bill . Sit . Mm . I try to take care of anyone who 's served . I 'm sorry about the box , okay ? Luckily nothing was broken . It 's not just the box , Jim . I need a certain order to operate this facility , and you disrupt the flow of everything . I 'll get better . Well , you might be right , but I can 't afford to train you . This is just the easiest solution right now . Bill ... You 'll find something else . Have some ... faith . All right . That was fun . Jim ! Hey , Seth . We 're here . Just checked in . Catching some sun nearby . Uh , Seth , I 'm not feeling so well . Is that Jim ? Tell him I say hello . He says hello back . Hold on a sec . You don 't sound sick . Hey , you 're not trying to avoid seeing Angela and me ? I know seeing us together would be a little weird , but ... No , no , I 'm ... It 's not that . Wait , did you have an episode again ? Yeah . Oh , no . That 's terrible . When ? Just now . Where are you ? I 'm at home . You want us to come visit you ? No , you guys are just here for a few days . Uh , that settles it . We 're coming to see you . You may recall I make a chicken soup that will cure any illness . Not that chicken soup that left me on the throne for two days . Oh , yeah , that 's the one . You know what , I 'm feeling slightly better . See , the recipe works ! Okay , see ya , pal . Jim ! What ups ! Seth . Ha ha ! Not gonna let a little migraine stop us from seeing each other . You had me at chicken soup . Oh , come on . Hey , Jim ! Angela . How are you ? Congrats on your first year of residency ! Thanks ! I can 't believe I got through it . You remember Kara , right ? Oh , hey , Kara . Hey ! What are you doing in LA ? Um , I 'm in between jobs . Jim is applying to the CIA . As an analyst , nothing glamorous . Until you save the world . Then I can say I knew you on my YouTube channel . Kara here is a very popular YouTuber . She has a rather large following of cute girls . That I 'm sure would love you . I certainly admire you guys for going after your dreams , but I just couldn 't give up flying business class . Seth made me and Angela fly economy . Hey , I earned those miles . And it was super sweet of him to treat us on this trip , right , Kara ? Thanks , Seth . Mm-hmm . Oh , can we see if the ice cream guy takes frequent flyer miles ? Ha ha . Although ... there 's nothing wrong with getting a punch card . Oh , my gosh . Oh , no , I got ya . This is nice . Yep . Oh , Seth , look , try and get us from the waist up . Okay , yeah ? Thanks . All right . * Hey Aah , it 's freezing ! Oh , my gosh . In the shot , right here . Kara 's pretty cute , huh ? You 're not trying to set me up now , are you ? No way , I would never do that ! Look , I know seeing Angela and I together must be hard . After you left Chicago , I think we both felt a void . Never really thought it was gonna work . Um , I wanted you to be the first to know . I 'm gonna ask Angela to marry me . So soon ? Yeah , think I 'm finally ready . Being single was fun , but ... now ? Think it 'd be nice to raise a family . That 's great . Oh , here it goes . Here it goes . Aah ! Oh , my gosh , it 's so cold ! Howdy , pretty people . Curious Kara here . Sorry I didn 't post a vid yesterday . I was in flight , but , as you can see , it was totally worth it ! Look ! Look at that . Gorgeous . Absolutely gorgeous . Wait a sec ! Who is that back there doing the worst attempt at a photo bomb ever ? Get over here . Hello . * Hello , it 's me * * I 've been wandering ' round * This is my bestie , Angela . Uh , the reason why you don 't see her in my vids too often is because she 's busy making babies . Kara ! Oh , wait , no ! I meant delivering babies . That 's better . Angela was also my sorority sis over at U Chicago back in the day . Yes , peeps , I was once part of a secret organization , meant to ... Kara , we swore an oath ! Oh , right . Sorry , guys , I can 't tell you . Um , but , guess in the comments section below , and don 't forget to subscribe ! - Bye for now ! - Bye . Well ! You guys look like you 're having a very romantic conversation . Yeah , I was about to do the yawn and stretcher on Jim . Oh , shoot me . Hey , did Seth tell you what we 're gonna be doing tomorrow ? Oh , no , he didn 't . Oh ! I found a guy on the internet who started an introductory gun school . So we 're gonna be driving out to shoot some guns in the desert . Figured the pacifist could use a little GI Joe action . Yeah , you 're just lucky you have a birthday coming up , buddy . Apparently they used to hold UFO conventions out there . Yeah , we 're extremely excited to learn more about Seth 's relatives from Uranus . Hmm ? Ooh , can we stop ? Yeah , let me find a spot . Ooh , right here 's ... Mm-hmm . Oh , my gosh ! Oh , that 's perfect . Mm , perfect . Oh , yes ! Oh , I can 't wait to post this ! Guess I know why they picked this place to be a windmill farm . That Ivy League education of yours was money well spent . Shut up . This is nice . Yeah . It 's good to get a change of scenery . It 's funny , since you moved in , I never see you . I 'm sorry . Look , once I finish residency , things will be different , okay ? It 's just I 'm always on call right now . I 'm glad they let you have these few days . I know . It 's hard to detach sometimes . In the future , if you want to , I do make enough for the both of us , and , uh ... Seth , it ... It 's not about the money . I 'm just saying it 's an option . They need me there . I can 't just give up ... That 's fine . You can 't make them your whole life . Hey , guys ! Let 's all take a picture together ! - Come on ! - Sure . Okay . - Oh , wait , it 's on ... slow-mo . - Oh , wait ! Oh , yeah , I think that we should get some slow-mo in . And then do the ... movement . - Oh , wow . - Oh , yeah . What do we got ? So much hair ! So much hair ! Oh , no ! - Oh , my God . - Okay . If that 's not a blackmail picture , I don 't know what is ! Oh ! Ugh , it 's all blurry ! That sucks . Can we go back ? - We 're not going back . - Please ! - No . - Please , pretty please ! No , I know what happens . We 'll take a hundred pictures . We 'll never get out of there . - Please . - Uh-uh . Ugh ! Fine . Ack ! Jim , I 'm so happy that you 're here ! Now I finally have someone who at least knows his way around a camera . Didn 't you just yesterday say you liked my photos ? I work with what I got . All right , how about I take a picture of you on the rock ? I guess I can give you a chance to redeem yourself . - Okay . - Think you 're good . Yeah ? Now pretend the boulder 's going to fall on you . - I 'm not gonna do that ! - Come on ! She 's cool . Yeah ... she is . - ... like that . - What ? Come on . Yay , we 're here ! - It 's like ... - Yeah , that 's what I was thinking . Yeah , I mean , that 's what he tells me . Well , you know . When you 're right , you 're right . Hey ! How are you ? - Hey . - Good . You 're Seth , I take it ? - Yeah . - Hey , how are you ? - I 'm good . - Yeah . John . Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you . This is Jim . Hey , Jim . John . Nice to meet you . - How you doing ? - Very good . - Angela . - Hi , Angela , how you doing ? - Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you as well . - Pleasure . - Kara 's around here somewhere . - Kara , okay . - Where 'd she go ? - Kara ? - I don 't know . She was just over there . Uh , hold on a sec . I 'll go find her . Uh , who 's this we 're waiting for ? - Oh , Kara . - Oh , Kara . Right there . Okay . Kara ? Kara ! Kara ? Oh , my gosh , you scared me ! Come on , we 're heading out . Let 's go . No , wait a minute . Come here . According to Wikipedia , some German dude used to talk to aliens over this funky radio he built . - Wow . - Whoo ! This looks ... legit . All right , ladies , you can do the touristy hoax shit later if you want . Let 's head out . Drive 's about five miles from here . It 's okay to leave my car here ? Yeah , you can put it back there . Damn dune buggies and dirt bikes , tearing up the road like snowboarders . Make it impossible to drive faster . Don 't worry about that . There 's nothing out here . Just maybe a couple of land mines . Boom ! I 'll watch my step . You better ! - Your son ? - Yeah , yeah , that 's my son . - How old is he ? - He 's 11 . He 's going into boarding school next year . That must be expensive . Uh , you be telling me . Ah . Any of you know your way around weapons ? I got four years Army Reserves . Oh , yeah ? What was your MOS ? Military intelligence . Ah , you 're a spook . - Now if I told you ... - Yeah ? - ... I 'd have to kill you . - Ooh ! You ? How about you ? How do you know so much about guns ? Ah , retired Special Forces . This must be a walk in the park for you . Ah , easier than working at the post office , I 'll tell you that . Seriously ? It 's extremely stressful delivering people 's mail . I 'm sure it is . Yup . Here 's some ear protection . Put those on . Great . Let 's get started . Firearm safety is everyone 's responsibility . Common 9mm pistol . Easy to aim and carry . Safety 's here . This is an M4 semi-automatic in 5.56 . No magazine ... nothing in the chamber . That 's how it 's done . This is a precision rifle in .308 . It 's capable of amazing accuracy , if you watch your breathing . And finally , the last rule and most important rule ... Better safe than shot . Let 's have a good time , and let 's make sure that we leave with the same number of holes in our body that we came with . - Nice ! - Yes , I like this ! Well done . How was that ? You 're a natural . Ha ! Wow , that 's fun . That 's well done . Ah , when I squeeze the trigger and hold it down , that 's when I hit dead center . That 's it ! Good job , yeah ! Nice . Nice grouping . It 's been a long time , but still got some of it . Yeah . I see all of it . All right , keep going . All right . Wow . Got it . Got it ! So , here 's your first shot . You 're ready for your zombie apocalypse . Your second shot , I don 't know where that went . Uh , oh , look , here 's a shot here by the heart . You almost killed him . Ah , Kara , shot him in the lungs , can 't breathe . Ah , nice . Oh , and Angela , nice liver shot right there . Good job . So , we just shot some live weapons , as John calls it . He 's our instructor . Jim showed off his military training . Angela surprised me , she 's actually not so bad , and Seth , well ... Kara , we 're all out of targets . Can you go down range ? Bye . I could get used to this . Whoo ! Holy shit ! What ? Sorry . Yeah-ha-ha ! Scary ! Oh , dear . Hoo . Oh , shit . Turn the safety on next time . All right . That was bad . Yeah , so this weapon , what was it , Wess ... - Wesson ? - Smith and Western . Wesson . I thought you ... Wesson . Don 't play with me . That was my favorite . How ' bout you guys ? - The M4 . - Ooh , what you got there ? Tannerite . We 're gonna shoot it , and when we do , it 'll go boom ! Cool ! Can I try ? Of course . Going down range . Is this legal ? In certain states . Damn it ! Ugh ! You suck ! Let me show you how a man fires a weapon . Oh , please do . Represent , Seth . In anything I do when under pressure , I never fail . Fuck ! Oh , you sure shoot like a man ! - Jim ? - I 'm good . Angela ? No . Kara , why don 't you try again ? Going hot . You think you can shoot , huh ? You think you can shoot ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm gonna shoot you . Yeah . I hit ... like ... a girl . - Wow ! - That was great ! - Oh , boy . - Let 's go check the target . Going down range . - Hey ! Hey ! - Kara , slow down ! Kara ! Ka ... What is she doing ? She always does stuff like this . Really ? Yeah , she 's just always getting into trouble . It 's okay . There 's nothing down there , anyway . Hey , guys ! I think we hit something . Some sort of dark red sand . - Kara ! - Stay back ! - Kara ! - No ! No , let me go ! Let me go ! - Oh , fuck . - I have to get to her . Kara ! No ! Let me go ! Ohh ... Kara ! Are you all right ? Oh , yeah , I 'm fine . Jim , are you okay ? Oh , Seth , help Jim ! Come on , go ! We got you , buddy . Quadrant three search complete . Moving to quadrant four . Searching for EMP signatures . What the hell was that stuff ? - John , have you got some water ? - Sure , sure ! Gosh , Kara , what were you thinking ! I 'm such an idiot , I 'm sorry ! I was just so excited I hit the damn thing . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . - Seth , are you all right ? - Yeah . - Here . - Here , take this . Jim ! Jim , are you okay ? Can 't ... can 't focus . You guys , my phone is dead . - Mine , too ! - What the freak ! - God ! - It 's dead ! Now what ? - John ! - Hold on , wait a sec . Jim , can you walk ? Let me try . Let me try . Help him up . Come on , you guys . Come on . All right , all right . It 's 25 or 30 miles to the nearest gas station . All right , it 's getting dark . I got some sleeping bags , some snacks and water . Gonna find a place to camp tonight . I 'll leave out in the morning . I 'll come back with some help . Jim , you think you can wait it out tonight ? - Yeah . Yeah ... - Yeah ? Okay . Guys , I 'm gonna get us set up tonight . Maybe we shouldn 't have come out here , you guys . This is a bad idea . Hey , what are you doing so far away ? I was having hot flashes . Thought I was going through menopause . No fever . Must be feeling better . Good . You were starting to sound like a big baby . Wow . What a doctor . Oh , I forgot to tell you ! I delivered my first baby by myself a few weeks ago . Wow , they let you in your first year ? I know , right ? Gosh , it was , like , 3 am and my supervisor couldn 't make it through the snow . Charles Lee , 6 1 / 2 pounds . Gosh , it felt like I gave birth myself ... without the pain , just the sweat . That 's great . Yeah . Your mom and dad must 've been so proud . How are they doing ? They 're good . They , uh , they ask about you all the time . They were really sad when I told them you were moving to LA . I 'm happy for you and Seth . Rest . Hey . Hey . You okay ? Ahem . Yeah , I 'm fine . I like Jim . Glad you guys hit it off . But I think he just doesn 't know how to appreciate someone like me . - Well ... - Not like you . Hey , how you doing ? - Guys want some ? - Definitely . Huh ? Here go you . - Thanks . - Sure . I wish my phone worked so I could document all of this . Yeah , I don 't get people nowadays that take pictures of everything . I 'm used to the old-school pictures . I thought it was stupid at first , but then my Grandma got Alzheimer 's , so I take pictures in case I forget . Well , cheers to , uh , capturing every moment . Cheers . Glad you guys are all okay . Hear , hear . Guys ? Guys ? Hello ? Oh , hey . What are you doing out here ? Aah ! - What was that ? - I don 't know . We should go find out . Why did you come here ? Kara ? Seth ? - Seth ? - Seth , Kara ? Whoa , whoa . Whoa , John ? John ? What is he doing ? Did you say something ? Why aren 't you responding to normal channels , Jim ? What is he talking about ? I don 't know . John , what 's wrong with you ? I 'm perfectly fine , Jim . It 's you who seems to be malfunctioning . What 's wrong with him ? What ... What are you talking about ? Angela ... I want you to get out of here right now . Find Kara and Seth . John , back up ! Go . - No . - Go ! Get outta here ! Okay ! What the hell ? - John ? - Let 's test your strength . John ? John ? Whoa ! Hahh ! Mmuhh ! Your strength is greater than anticipated . Hwah ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . - Hey . - Back off , John . Hey , Jim . What are you doing ? It 's me . Stand down ! I 'll shoot , I swear . I 'll shoot . Hey , hey , it 's ... It 's me . It 's John . Just put the gun down . - There you go . - John ? There you go . Just put it down . Yeah . There you go . Good . I got you . Ready ? Kara ? Kara ! Kara ? Kara , where have you been ? Jim 's in trouble . I need your help . I 'm sure he 's fine . In fact , I bet he 's better than before . No , he 's not . John 's gone crazy . We have to get out of here right now . Why ? Don 't you want to be a part of something greater ? Kara , what 's wrong with you ? I 'll show you the meaning of true sisterhood . Kara , snap out of it . Hey , that hurts . Ow ! Ow ! Angela ! Ow ! Ow ! Sick ! Dah ! You utilize John 's skills much better than we do . How ? Are you all right ? Yeah , I think so . We should ... We should find Seth . Yeah , uh , we should get to the car . - All right , yeah . - Let 's go . What was that ? How did you move like that ? I don 't know . John . He attacked me . Just like Kara . I was forced to shoot him . Quadrant four sweep complete . Location acquired . His body was right here . Where 'd it go ? - I don 't know . - Wait . Where are you going ? How do you know how to use John 's gun ? I don 't know , I just do . Don 't move . Put the gun down . - All right . - Don 't hurt us ! Do it now . Step away from the gun . Okay . Step away from the gun . We have eyes on two . Copy that . Inbound with one . ETA one minute and 12 . Copy that . Ross , retrieve the gun . Clear . Copy that . Seth , are you all right ? I 'm fine . Relax . I 'm Capt. Linden . We have readings of a strong electromagnetic disturbance in the area . Any idea where it 's coming from ? Could we see some credentials ? Ma 'am , that 's classified , but I can assure you that we 're here to help . Jim , Angela , we should cooperate . Your friend 's smart . You should listen to him . Any idea where that blast came from ? Just over that ridge . I 'll show you . Ross , Seto , provide an escort . That 's double time , boys . We just want to get a visual . Proceed with extreme caution . Copy that . What 's taking them so long ? I don 't know . Come on . Come on . Seth ! Oh , please no ! Ross , Seto , report ! - Seth ! - Oh , my gosh . Ross , Seto , report ! What 's going on ? Geez . Okay . Ross , Seto ! Seth ! What 's the deal , boys ? Where 's Seth ? I don 't see him . Oh , my gosh . Get down . Get down , now ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Aah ! We 've gotta get him out of here right away . I won 't make it . Unh ! Here , take this . What 's this for ? We 're part of a covert task force ... fighting to keep the human race from extinction . Extinction from what ? - From aliens . - I don 't believe this . There 's a group of grays who 've developed biological control mechanisms . At first they used it to build the Pyramids , but now their objectives have changed . To what ? We don 't know . They 're starting to move . Take that ring . Find Dr. Victoria Jansen . Show it to her . She 'll know what to do . I 'll fight them off . Do it ! Come on , let 's go , now ! Whoa , whoa . Wait , wait . Where are we going ? Our car . It might be out of the blast radius . Dr. Victoria Jansen ! Trust no one else ! Aah ! Die ! Wait ! Hang on ! Hold on a sec . I need a break . Oh , my gosh . Oh ! Do you think Seth is still alive back there ? It 's possible . Why aren 't you affected ? Did you ever get those migraines checked out ? Do you know what they 're from ? They think it 's some sort of anemia . Weirdly shaped red blood cells . Maybe it 's protecting you . Whatever it is , we need to move fast . - Can you keep going ? - Yeah . - All right , let 's go . - All right . Attention , Alpha Tango Echo 53 . Target lock has been lost . Resuming sweep pattern . Full report when visual has been reacquired . What the fuck ? Aah ! That 's Kara . We need to get to the car . Take this . Jim , I can 't . Take this . You gotta get out of here and tell the world about this , all right ? - Uhh ! - Aah ! We go now . Come on ! Okay . You can do this . - Come on , Angela ! - Oh , shit . What the ... ? Oh , my gosh . Oh , no . Don 't move ! He 's walking towards us ! - Don 't move , I 'll shoot ! - Do something ! Still coming . Back off ! - Shoot him in the head ! - Back off ! Come on , let 's go . Shit , what ... I shot him in the head ! Oh , no ! Well , where do I shoot him now ? Try the liver ! All right ! Oh , my gosh . I think that worked ! How 'd you know ? The liver filters and processes blood . More like a lucky guess . Lucky . Let 's go ! Oh , my gosh . Aah ! Aah ! Oh ! Jim ! Kara ... Still don 't understand you , Jim . How do you resist ? What are you ? Come join us . Share in our collective knowledge and find out . I 'm fine just how I am . Really ? Look how pathetic humans are without us ! Angela ! Kill me . Please . I can 't stop myself ... from doing these horrible , horrible things . Fight it , okay ? The voices ! Everything feels better when I listen . There 's a cure , okay ? Listen to me ! It 's a hunger . - It 's an insatiable hunger ! - Stop ! You 're my best friend . There 's no cure , Angela . Kara , back ! There 's no cure . I know there 's no cure . It 's in me . It 's in me ! Kill me , please . I can 't . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry , Kara , I can 't . That 's because you 're weak ! You 're all weak ! Oh , my God . Kara ! Oh , oh ! What have I done ? Oh , I am so sorry . No , no , no . No , please . Please . Aah ! Ange . Ange ! What ? We need to get out of here . You were always leaving me . I 'm not leaving you . If they look like us , they sound like us ... they know how to push our buttons . Seth ... We 'll try to get him back . I should 've never let you go . You 're damn right . Jim ! Marco ... Aw , fuck . It 's your line , Jim . Polo ! Come on . Uhh ! Hey , Jim ! It 's me . Your buddy Seth . You 're not Seth . Who 's to say I 'm not ? Just a better version of Seth . Ah ! The Seth I knew was a good person . Oh , is he ? Aah ! He was about to marry the love of your life ! Fuck ! She 's better off without me . It 's not too late , Jim . You can still join us . This is our gift to humanity . Doesn 't feel like Christmas to me . We can solve all the world 's problems ! Never let idiots with the loudest voices run our world ! Because they 'll have to listen to us . Fuck . We 're not here just to follow orders . Why 'd you want to join the CIA ? That 's about following orders . Isn 't it the same ? I want to fight for something I believe in . Fight for somebody ... who can 't fight for themselves ! Fuck ! You 're an idealistic fool , Jim . Aah ! Dah ! Nothing can stop us . Aaah ! Nothing is stronger than us . You have John 's skills , which are formidable . But I have everyone else 's . Wake up , Seth . Wake up ! Ohh ! Aah ! Careful , Jim . That 's a sensitive area . Did you even tell Angela why you left ? That you can 't have kids ? You 're a coward , Jim . I 'm sorry . No ! Seth . Take care of Angela for me . - Jim ! - Let her go , it 's fine . I found the doctor . She can help us . Oh , Seth . No , it 's not him . I couldn 't get him back . This is Dr. Jensen . You 're Jim ? Angela 's told me all about you . We need to talk now . Follow me , please . Got no time to waste . Let 's go , boys . Social connection is essential to survival , and they impart that fundamental need and make you feel that what you 're doing is both ethically and morally correct so that you won 't resist it , you won 't even question it . No logic , no reasoning , no emotion , nothing can overpower this altered reality they put you in . You speak of " they . " Who are " they " ? We don 't know , but you 're gonna help us find out , Jim . Let me show you . So , how 's the progress ? Tests are going really well . Jim holds the key to reverse-engineering chemical 852 . That 's great news . Keep me up to date .

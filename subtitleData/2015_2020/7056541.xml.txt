 - Saurian Attack Fighters have broken through the front lines . - We are in route to target . Evasive maneuvers ! - Initiate attack vector at coordinates six J alpha 12 . - Affirmed . They 're coming in too fast ! I can 't ... - Saurian target acquired . Squadron X , move in ! - Directly ahead , vector 1-1-3-8 . Direct hit ! Defensive aura holding . - It 's on a collision course ! - Break formation ! - Target reacquired . - Senjo formation five . - Senjo Five . Position locked . Nova , engage lon bridge . - Engaged . - Okay boys and girls , let 's remind this Saurian viper how the Terran empire deals with invaders . Fire ! - Target Locked ! - We broke through the defensive aura . Secondary engines severely damaged . - It 's adrift . Stabilizers down . - Let 's finish this . Target primary atomic engine . What ? - Terran squadron commander , stand down . That ship is protected . - Unidentified vessel , do not interfere , we are under orders . - I 've just given you new orders . - And who are you to issue orders to Squadron X ? - Captain Saber Raine , Terran Special Operations . - Captain Raine I must inform you , you are interfering with extermination orders from the Rear Admiral . - And I 'm telling you , Commander , that order is wrong . I will bring that ship and its captain in . You will stand down ! - Its engines are coming back on line ! - Ha ! - It 's breaking away , sir . - Sorry sir , no can do . Squadron X , Senjo formation two . - Senjo formation two . - Bad move . - I 'm under fire ! Evasive maneuvers ! - Commander , your shields have been disrupted . Stand down ! - You just fired on your own forces . That is an act of treason ! - Circe , open a channel . - The channel 's open , sir . - Captain , this is a direct order . Disengage ! - I can 't obey that order , sir . - This is your last chance , Saber . - That 's a negative , sir ! - Then you leave me no choice . Commander Squadron X ... Terminate with extreme prejudice ! - Affirmative . Squadron X , take him out ! - Always gotta be the hard way . - The system 's core has reached maximum capacity . - They can 't get through his shields . - Engine core levels at full power . - Plasma Torpedo . - Plasma torpedo away . - Coordinates Alpha six four seven . Initiate attack vector . - He 's headed straight at us ! - I can see that , thank you Orion . Open fire ! All batteries ! - Focus firepower toward the engine . All hands brace for impact . We 're venting tri-plasma , dispatch repair crews . - He 's launched a fusion mine ! - Evacuate the ship ! - All hands abandon ship ! I repeat , all hands abandon ship ! - Damn you , Saber . - Sensors . - No heat signature at all . Must be cold blooded . - Control , what is this thing ? - Scanning , sir . Unknown sir , there is no match in the database . - Switch to motion sensors . - Captain Raine . - Saber , and don 't salute me . - I 'm Commander Voss , I lead this operation . This is Ryll my Arms Master , and reconnaissance specialist Fade . - We should get out of here . - What were those things ? - And why didn 't they emit life signs ? - Mutates , and they didn 't emit life signs because they aren 't alive . They 're corpses animated by some kind of larvae that feeds off the bodies of the dead . Part of the reason no one comes to this planet . It 's a consequence of what happened here centuries ago . - About that , there 's no data available , no records . Just a quarantine ordering all vessels to stay clear of this sector . And this planet isn 't on any known chart . - It 's a good thing you got the coordinates I sent you . I 'll tell you what I know . This world , was once called Goros Prime . - Never heard of it . - I have , a planet of legend , ruled by a ruthless overlord . - Stories I was told it was merciless and sinister but ruthless will work . When they rediscovered this planet they quarantined it . But some have ignored the quarantine . They come here to conduct their business beyond prying eyes . - People like you . - People way worse than me . - Renegades , smugglers . - Your enormous bounty got me here . But your transmission neglected to give me the specifics of what we 're after exactly . - We could not transmit that information for fear it would be intercepted . - I don 't think anyone 's listening . - Members of the Aresian Royal Family were taken . - The Prince and Princess . The King 's only heirs . - They also took a single piece of treasure from the King 's vault . - Whoever abducted them , managed to leave the planet undetected . - Tell me about the treasure . - A single jewel , a relic acquired centuries ago on a Xenoarcheological dig on the planet Phobos . - Valuable ? - Insignificant , an information storage device . He 's more concerned with the treasure than with the lives of our people . - I 'm surprised your planet only dispatched the three of you . - We alone were responsible for their protection . Our code of honor dictates that we must find those responsible . - And kill them . - Discretely . If the King dies before we return with his children , we will be honor bound to join him in the afterlife . - I have a ... friend . If it 's happening on Goros , he 'll know about it . - I trust you are comfortable . - My comfort is irrelevant . Where is my brother ? - He has been enjoying my hospitality . You will tell me what I want to know , and with that knowledge I will conquer the universe . - I 'll tell you a secret . We may be royalty , but we are still warriors . Our father will not stop searching for us . - But he won 't find you , no one will . - Who are you ? - I am Sinjin ! But you , along with all living creatures , need only call me master ! Warriors ! ? Pathetic ! - You got a problem ? - I don 't trust you . - You don 't know me . - Really ? Control , information on an individual known as Saber Raine . - Saber Raine , origin Earth 2762 . Decorated officer in the Cyber-Corps . Given Command of his own unit in 2784 . - That doesn 't sound so bad . - 2790 . Records indicate his entire team was lost during the Saurian invasion on Mars . Saber Raine was the sole survivor . Subject was sent into deep cover to gain intelligence on the Saurians . Weeks into his mission subject dissapeared , believed dead . - But you didn 't perish , did you ? - Resurfaced in 2792 just as a massive Terran force was assaulting the Saurian homeworld . Subject sided with the enemy . Labeled a traitor . - Thank you , Control . Ryll , this is accomplishing nothing . - He 's a mercenary . Unworthy . - I don 't need you to tell me about my past . I lived it . We 're here now . You need my help , and I need to know you got my back . Or are your personal feelings more important than those lives you swore to protect ? - Your weapons , they fire projectiles propelled by exploding gas . - Bullets , T-2 explosives . Saved your ass ! - Primitive and inferior ! - Can we stop trying to compare the size of our guns ? And go find your people . It 's just over that ridge . Keep your red eye open , we 're in Annelid territory . - What 's an Annelid ? - You don 't want to know ! After you . - Hold it right there . - Bad move . On this planet , you always have backup . - Saber Raine . - In the flesh . - I 'm surprised to see you . Alive . Hello . What have we here ? Aresians . Traveling in some elite circles , I see . - Yeah , we 're uh old pals . - That 's good , cause you haven 't got many ' round here . - We 're looking for some friends . I thought maybe you could help . - This a bounty ? 'Cause if I gotta betray one of my friends , it 's gonna cost more . - Visitors . They 're ... - Brought against their will . - Slavers , maybe . There 's been an increase in traffic lately . A Denarian you might remember . Lorthos ? Known in this part of the galaxy as the Slave Master . - Lorthos is a thug ! Preys on unarmed vessels and isolated encampments . We 're trying to find ... - Find other Aresians . - And we 'd appreciate any information you can provide . - Pretty . But you 'll have to sweeten the pot . Say ... one power cylinder . I 've heard many tales in my line of work , and the stories of the Aresian power cylinder have always intrigued me . - Just stories . - Then I 'm afraid I can 't help you . - You better know something . - I think your friends are now my friends . I don 't know anything about any captives . - Always have backup . - But there has been a lot of activity in the great ruins lately . Ships seen flying in that direction . Annelids being slaughtered in the surrounding out lands by organized forces . - Why is that important ? - There 's a lot of strange creatures on Goros . Different warring factions . But they all have one thing in common . They all stay clear of the ruins . - Why ? - ' Cause anything that goes in there , doesn 't usually come out . With a few exceptions . - I haven 't actually been to the ruins per se but I 've seen them from a distance . It 's the perfect place to keep someone prisoner . - Then that 's our destination . - It 's not safe to travel at night . You can stay here till morning . - I think we 'll stick to the schedule . Thanks , Jax . I 'm sorry bout your uh ... Rock Guy . - It 's okay . I have more in the mines . If you survive this , I expect intel . - It 'll cost ya . Let 's go . Take it easy , Jax . - She 's gone . Easy . Name 's Kor 'ock , I 'm a transport pilot . - Where are we ? What planet ? - What planet ? ! Goros Prime . - What do you know of our captors ? - Not much . I was flying near the outland mires , my ship lost power , crash landed . Had four on board , only two survived . - Where are the other survivors ? - I don 't know , we were separated . And you ? - Unclear . My sister and I were on Ares , our homeworld . And then we woke up here . Prisoners . You look strangely calm ! - Universe has a plan for everyone , kid . I 'm just waiting to see what it has planned for me . - The power cylinder , it 's a mana stone , isn 't it ? And you 're not concerned with giving one to Jax ? - A necessary action . Our mission is paramount . Besides , it 's a very unstable substance . - Are you saying my friend could blow himself up ? - Now let me ask you something . - Alright . - Tell me why you betrayed your people . - Excuse me ? - You seem like a man of honor . So there must be a reason why you assisted the Saurians . - One Saurian . Crotalus . I had to act or she would have died . I couldn 't have that on my conscience . Crotalus gave me information that let our forces penetrate their defenses on Erobus Two . She 's the reason we won the war . My government didn 't want the rest of the galaxy to know that we couldn 't do it on our own . So they wanted her silenced . - And you turned on your own to protect her . - Wrong is wrong , Fade . She was a hero . - We 've rested long enough . - Control , we 're on the move . - Control ? Respond . - We must 've entered the mire . Your power sources won 't work here . Guess my gas propelled projectiles don 't look so bad now , do they ? Just saying . - You knew this would happen ? - This area is strange on tech . That 's why I gave you the coordinates I did . Ship coming down here , it 'd be bad . But it 's the only way to the ruins . - Our ships are prepared . Why must we wait ? - So you find my hospitality is inadequate ? - I find my thirst for revenge unquenched . - The generator is nearly complete , but the power source remains unstable . The equation must be precise . - He says , you should let his hive interrogate the prisoners . They will succeed where you have failed . - And if he were to perish ? No , by the time the generator is operational , I will have what I need from him . And your ships will have the power to unleash my wrath across the universe ! - We are an alliance . We do not serve you ! I have cleared a path through the mires , provided you with subjects to modify . You boast of a once great empire . So far I am unimpressed ! - He is correct . You may have initiated this alliance , but we have provided all the raw materials , and the technology . - And the technology . You have such little minds . Each of your races have been defeated by those you attempted to conquer . What I offer is beyond your comprehension . An unbeliever . A demonstration is required . It is difficult to kill that which does not truly live . My construct is not powered by science . It 's powered by the mind . Alive because I will it into existence ! - So you would kill me as a show of your power ? - No , killing you would be pointless . Return to your vessels , and continue your preparations . Go ! Go ! - Commander Voss , please respond . Scheduled check in time has elapsed . Recovery protocol one initiating . - Who are you ? - We 're the cavalry . - My legs , they 're going numb . I , I , I think it was some sort of toxin . - We did not need to engage these creatures at close range . You could 've dispatched them from a distance ! - The noise would 've brought more . We 're lucky this was a small band . - We need to move out . - Commander ! Father . - You must finish the mission . Find the heirs ! - We 'll find them together . - No . - Fade , we have to go . - Fade . Now . We make our stand here . Always gotta be the hard way . Always have backup . - Caliope ! - I was strong . - I know you were . It 's okay , he 's a friend . - We have no friends here . - Alright . I 'll leave you two alone . - I 'm sorry , they 're doing this to you to get to me . - No matter what they do , you cannot give them what they seek . We will find a way out of here , and get back home . And we will return to this planet with a vengeance . Tyr , you were the only one father entrusted the secret to before his illness , you must get back home ! You must lead our people . - I can 't let them put their hands on you again . - I don 't matter ! - You 've always been so strong . - We must fight to protect what is ours . - I know father never said it . But he is proud of you . Your passion for Xeno archeology , your drive to understanding a greater universe , a mind like yours cannot be lost . You do matter . I will give them what they want . In return for your safe passage back to Ares . You will lead in my stead . - Tyr , no . - I will give you the same honor father bestowed upon me . The frequency that causes the mana stone to release controlled energy . - This is madness , there must be another way . - Even if they have it , they would have to acquire raw material , build a refinement facility . It would take a great deal of time . More than enough time for you to bring back our forces , and eliminate the threat . - Either way , you would surely die . - Knowing that you 'll live . Caliope please , as you said , we must protect what is ours . - You know . That 's a pretty good plan . Just might work . - How do you know he would honor your request ? - We will have a code word , a word that you will give to those that return you to safety . Once that word has been relayed back to me , I will reveal the information to Sinjin . Good . I 'm sorry , my friend . - Now , look kid ! What I say now is for my sister 's ears only . - Recovery drones offline . - Easy . You 've been poisoned . I 've applied a remedy to the wound , you must give it time to work . Good morning . - I see you 've met my friend . This is Crotalus . - Have no fear . I 've dispatched their priestess . They won 't be returning any time soon . - My father ? - I 'm sorry . - He died as he lived . With honor . - His body ? - We must build a pyre . - I 'm not certain that that 's a wise choice . I fail to see how igniting a blaze will assist us in remaining undetected in dangerous territory . - I hope you brought some more ammo . It 's always gotta be the hard way . - She stays here . I will offer my terms . - Be wary , he 's not to be trusted . - Yes , investigate . Your sister 's freedom for the information I seek . I will consider your offer . But before I decide , do you have any idea who I am ? - One of the many would be conquerors of the universe who seeks to steal the secrets of the mana stone . - The way your race has used technology to unleash its power is impressive . - What do you know of the mana stone ? - What do I know ? I know it did not originate on your planet . I know it was stolen in battle centuries ago ! And horded it to build your own empire . - And how do you know this ? ! - Because I was there ! Your race originated here ... on Goros . - Impossible ! Our home is Ares ... - Ares , is not your world . Your ancestors took refuge there , after the greatest galactic war the universe has ever seen . You are children of Goros . - I don 't believe you . - Yes , you do . When your ancestors allied themselves with my ancient enemy , the ensuing battle decimated this planet . Only through my power , I was able to protect a small piece of Goros . At the moment of my greatest glory , I was betrayed from within . - You 're mad - I only want what 's destined to be mine ! - A grand story that has illuminated me . Now I know I can never reveal what I know . No matter the cost ! You don 't have to . Your secret is already mine . - Caliope ? ! No . - This is how it is supposed to be . - But our world . Our family ! - Don 't you understand ? Sinjin is our family . Our oldest ancestor . - You can 't believe what this creature is telling you ! - A history gem I discovered in the vaults on Ares . Proof of our lineage . From the gem I learned the location of this planet . I discovered the remnants of that ancient battle . As if pulled by some unknown force , I was drawn to a hidden chamber . Sinjin was still alive in cryostasis . I knew it was my destiny to revive him . - It 's all a lie , Tyr . Our history on Ares has been manufactured to conceal our past . A past where we turned on our own . A past I will see corrected . The generator has already been constructed . A supply of refined mana stone provided . Sinjin controls the power of the mana stone with telepathy . We manipulate it with technology . Together , we will establish a new power in the universe . Now you have a choice to make . - There is no choice . - There 's always a choice , brother . I was hoping you 'd understand . - Understand ? You had us brought here ! Allied yourself with an abomination from our past ! You tricked me ! Into revealing the resonance frequency and you have a delusion of conquest ? ! - It 's not a delusion if you can do it ! - This isn 't like you ! - This is me ! In studying the universe , there is one constant . War . At any given moment , there are dozens of planets engaged in battle . Empires rise and fall . - And you believe such chaos can be controlled ? - Yes . The universe needs to be cleansed . Re-shaped . - Now I understand . You were the oldest , yet father chose to pass his mantel on to me . He must 've recognized what I did not . You are unworthy ! Regardless of what happens to me , Ares will stand against you ! - Ares will not see this coming ! Soon I will return home devastated by the loss of my brother . Soon after father will die , and I will assume the throne . Ares and Goros will reunite and history will once again be rewritten . - You are demented , sister ! - No , no , my friend . She is a woman about to become a goddess . - And you will live to see my ascension . - I 'm Fade . I didn 't get a chance to thank you . You saved us all . - It wasn 't too difficult . I have some experience with toxins . - I apologize for Fade 's emotional outburst . - What ? No , not at all , she lost her father . - And I lost a brother . - I had no idea . - All Aresian families serve together . It assures the highest level of loyalty . - You were tracking us ? - Following , at Saber 's request . He has rather a large bounty on him that many find hard to resist . He 's very careful . - So ... You and Saber ? - Oh ! No , no . He 's attractive on the inside . But we 're incompatible . There . - The Ruins . - My weapon 's power has been restored . - Control ? It 's active but there 's no signal . - Yeah , we must be in they eye of the mire . - Something tells me we 're about to walk into something much more dangerous . - Oh , hell no . Hey guys , can we talk about this ? - Did you get a look at those things ? - Organized . Soldiers . - They 're protecting something . A good sign . - If you say so . Let 's introduce ourselves ! - The generator is fully operational . Our ships are being connected as we speak . - In a matter of hours your ships will know the power of Aresian ... of Gorosian technology . What is it ? - What is wrong ? - We have visitors . - Who ? Where ? - Nearby . As for who , crimson eyes . I think they are your brethren . - How many ? - I saw three before my Skelion guards were dispatched . - Caveliers most likely . - Only three ? - Caveliers are very resourceful . Likely to have a battle cruiser . Heavily armored and powered by mana stone technology . - We lack sufficient forces . If they find us , others will follow . - Take a few Quintari pilots , patrol the skies , while the remaining ships stay connected to the generator . - But what of the mire ? - The mire is a defense field of my creation . It can be deactivated . - We will intercept them on the ground . - They cannot leave here alive ! - Some type of central control system linked directly to the recipient 's brain . - Barbaric . - Was it actually alive ? - At some point it was . And based on its organic state , it wasn 't that long ago . But now it 's just a mindless thrall . - If that 's the case , then someone or something was controlling it . - Which means it 's likely we have been detected . - So much for the element of surprise . - Say it . - Say what ? It 's always gotta be the hard way . - Now we can proceed . - Don 't touch me ! - Why , you ! What did they do to you ? - I think I know what happened to the rest of my crew . It 's synthetic , but I can feel it . - We have to get out of here . - Yeah about that , I brought you a present . - Can you travel ? - I 'd like to , but I don 't think so . You have to save your sister . - I 'm not sure that 's possible . I 'm sorry , my friend . - We are airborne and remain on the perimeter , awaiting your command . - The mire is down . - Drone communication re-established . Recovery protocols re-engaged . Commander Voss , offline . Lieutenant Ryll , please respond . Repeat . Lieutenant Ryll , report . - Hold on . Control . - Affirmative , sir . What is your situation ? - Commander Voss is dead . Understood , Commander . Recovery drones en route . ETA 10 . - Very good . Bring them in low . We 're approaching target area and drones will only serve to alert them to our position . - Understood . Flying in low . - They may already know our position . Approaching from directly ahead . Where 's Saber ? - Perhaps we should follow his lead . - We move forward . - Princess ! - Release her ! - I am not a prisoner , Ryll . These are friends . I 'm here on a secret mission . A mission you can now assist me with . - Something 's not right , Princess . Those who stand beside you are friends to no one . - Where is Prince Tyr ? - The prince is dead. - And you have sworn loyalty to the crown . To me . I 'm ordering you to put your weapons on the ground and stand down . - What are you doing ? ! - They 're doing their duty . What have we here ? A Saurian . It seems I 'm not the only one travelling with unlikely allies . Please do not interfere . - Your voice is kind but your intentions remain unclear . - Let me spell it out for you . - I see . - We have been searching for you . The king is very ill . You must return to Ares with us immediately . - Your dedication to your post is admirable , but no longer necessary . I will return to Ares soon enough . But first we must honor my brother with a funeral pyre . - I am far from dead ! - Well , that was unexpected . - You said he was dead ! He is ! He just doesn 't know it yet ! After him ! - I hate bugs ! - Raine ! - Lorthos ! You 're still on the wrong side , I see ! - That 's Lorthos ? From your stories I expected more . - You 'll make a nice pair of boots ! - This is pointless . Kill them all ! - Make it hurt ! - With pleasure . - Split up ! Draw their fire ! Control , are you getting this ? - Affirmative . Powering up . - Crotalus . - Cover me . - What ? - Cover me ! - It 's an honor to fight beside you . - What 's that ? - Incoming ! - Control , we could use those drones ! - Enemy targeted , engaging boosters . - Control , destroy all hostile targets . We 're in pursuit of the heirs . - Affirmative . - Drop it . - Who exactly are you ? - Saber Raine . - A mercenary . - I prefer adventurer . - Well , you 've stumbled into quite the adventure this time . - Always seems to happen that way . Turn around . - You really don 't understand what 's happening here . - Oh , I think I do . You teamed up with some bad guys , tried to kill your brother . Some sort of plan for world domination blah blah blah . My job was to find you . I 'll let you sort the rest out with your people . - So you 're for hire ? - Yup . Damn , I guess that does make me a mercenary , huh ? But if you 're thinking of making some sort of counter offer , don 't even bother . - A man of principles . - That 's right . This changes everything . I am now open for negotiations . My prices are extremely reasonable . - Kneel . - You need me to profess my undying loyalty , I can do that . I can do that . Now , I never , ever wanted to hit a woman , let alone a princess but ... You did just try to cut my head off , and on our first date . - Your attempt at humor is simply an effort to conceal your inadequacies as a man . - You know what ? I 'm going to have no problem doing this . - Perhaps your arrogance isn 't a ploy . You are quite skilled . - You have no idea . - Do it ! I said do it ! - Better late than never . - Unknown flyers . Engage in air to air protocols . - Farewell , hero ! - Can your weapons take that ship out ? - Possibly . - Maximum power . - Let 's go . - And now you die ! - Here we go . - I have gotta get me one of those ! - We didn 't fire . - Enemy vessel destroyed . - Always have backup . - Control , prepare for boarding . - Belay that order ! There is a danger here far more important than Caliope 's treachery . Do we have any other vessel to take us off this planet ? - Got my ship . The Gladiator . - Then the Trident has an important mission . - Awaiting orders . - He never goes anywhere without his guns . - What is happening ? - My instincts tell me we must leave this place . - They are nothing ! We have the power . - If there 's one thing my long sleep has taught me . Winning is about survival . I was trapped on this planet once . Never again ! - Should we alert our allies ? Tell them to evacuate . - I 've routed all power to another task . Their fate is their own . - Energy cloak engaged . Nearing target area . - Control , is the frequency I gave you set ? - Affirmative . Deviant frequency online and sonic projector charged . Are you at a safe range ? Please confirm you are at a safe range . - It doesn 't matter , complete your mission . - Affirmative . - It may not be her . - It is . I can feel it . - That is disturbing news . - If the threat is as dire as you suggest , you will have the full support of the Star Sentinels . - Thank you , Kandra Syn . I believe he will remain outside populated areas . Perhaps as far as Rogue Space . - Our scout ships will patrol the outer reach . - If he is found , he must be dealt with . - Aren 't we overreacting ? - Since when has earth had a problem with shooting first and asking questions later ? - Please Ambassador Steele , we must all be united in this effort . We have to be proactive , not reactive . - Do my ears deceive me ? The Aresian Empire , the Lunar Council of the Ghost Nebula , even the Sentinel Sisters . You are all actually afraid . - It 's not fear that guides our hand . It 's wisdom . There 's always going to be destructive forces in the universe that need to be opposed . - It is extreme to invoke a call to arms for just one man . - Ambassador . Sinjin is far more than a mere man . Our race was part of that war , so long ago . We know first hand of his malevolence . Should there even be a chance he lives , we must be prepared . - Which is why I think developing a military task force that is not only capable of protecting our worlds , but also those that cannot protect themselves is necessary . Do I have your support ? - I will get word to my sisters in all sectors . - We are at your disposal . - I would like a word in private . - Very well . - Prince Tyr . - It 's King Tyr now . As you are well aware , my father died days after my return . - Saber Raine . We would like him to be returned . No , Ambassador . Captain Raine is the leader of my new vanguard . And as such , he is considered to be a citizen of Ares . - This will not go over well with my people . And to think that he still travels with a Saurian ... - Is not your concern ! We have a real threat looming over us . And they have proven themselves worthy . We all have pasts , Ambassador , some darker than others . I suggest you stay focused on the darkness ahead . - Very well , King Tyr . I will confer with the Earth Confederation . And my condolences on the passing of your father to the next phase . - You handled that well , kid . - I need their help , but I cannot tell them what I learned about our dark origin . - I know . Your people have risen from the ashes of the past . Been reborn . You will lead them to greatness . - With men like you and Saber by my side , we can build a brighter future . - We can . I trust all is prepared ? - Yes . - Find her . - You clean up nice . - You look amazing . - What is it ? - It 's been a long time since I 've seen a real city . Walked among people without feeling like a target . - Well . You 're safe with me here . Just saying . - Ha . Like we didn 't see that one coming . - Status of the ship ? - Aresian power core installed . Ion engine capacity improved by 300 % . Weapons upgraded . - Excellent . - I have something for you . A gift , from the king , on my recommendation . - Now this is something I can use . - So , what 's next captain ? - Simple . We save the universe . - What are they ? - A long forgotten army . My army . To control them , you will learn to manipulate the mana stone , as I have . - Will I ... - Yes . You 'll go through a transformation . But what you lose in beauty , you will gain in unbridled power . - Teach me .

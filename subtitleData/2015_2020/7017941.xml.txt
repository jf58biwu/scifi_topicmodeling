 Previously , on Stitchers ... Kirsten : It 's foggy . Ayo : Her oxytocin levels are rising in response to what she 's seeing in the stitch . Camille : What was up with you in the lab yesterday , your hands were shakin ' pretty good . I 'm just trying to be a good scientist . Good scientist or worried boyfriend ? - I 'm looking for the M.E. - Amanda Weston . You fully coulda told me that on the phone . I know . But then you wouldn 't be here drinking whiskey with me . I don 't know . It takes me a minute to trust people . Everyone deserves to be trusted until proven otherwise . What are you doin ' later , do you wanna hang out , maybe ? It is a rolling cipher ! - Ha ! We did it ! - You did it ! Linus : You really have a super power . Everyone deserves to be trusted until proven otherwise ? I need to appoint someone to take on my responsibilities in the lab , and the only person that I think is capable is Cameron . - Why Cameron ? - " Everyone deserves to be trusted " ? That is a bad policy . - It won 't bite . - What ? - Maggie 's chair . - Oh . I know . I 'm just used to seeing her in the chair . Sitting . Glaring . Come here . ( exhales ) - Ooh . - How 's it feel ? - Oh , this is nice . - ( laughs ) Oh , yeah , it 's got that back support . - Oh ... - ( laughs ) Ahh . Oh gosh , I could get used to this . Oh , yeah ? Well , let me see . Mm ... yeah , you 're right , it 's very comfortable . Hey , I wanted to thank you for taking me to your mom . You didn 't have to . I know , but I 'm glad I did . I just ... I didn 't ... I didn 't feel right about keeping that from you . - And also ... - What ? It kinda felt like I was taking you to meet her for the first time . No , I liked meeting her . She 's a good listener . - What , too soon ? - Yeah , a little . - Oh , you wanna get some coffee ? - Sure . Always . I know where Maggie keeps her secret stash . Really ? I 'm coming . - ( theme music playing ) ♪ Take me inside ♪ ♪ Take me inside ♪ - ( phone chirps ) - God , please text more quietly . What 's with you ? Number one , nothing , number two , stop shouting . Mm . There you are . Where were you last night ? Out . Well , you look like hell . Well , your voice is like fingernails made of broken glass dragging across a blackboard made of more broken glass . - Mmm . - She 's hungover . I resent the implication . You texting Ivy ? Ivy ? Ohh , did I know you guys were a thing ? Uh , we 're just texting . Awesome . Let me see that real quick . - " Hey , Ivy , Camille here . " - ( texting ) " Just wanted to let you know that Maggie bitch-slapped me for saying I trusted you . " Thanks ! Good . You 're just kidding . Just about the text . Please tell me I didn 't violate my own judgment and lose a potentially career-changing promotion just so you could date the new brunette ? That 's not okay . We 're not okay . ( clears throat ) Cameron : Just got the call . New case . Victim 's name is " Mark Broden . " Camille ? Don 't look at me . I didn 't kill him . Well , I know , but this is the time where you do that thing with the thing , you know , you ... you run down the case for us . You mean , when Maggie 's in charge , and she gives me the case file ahead of time , so I have a chance to review it and prepare first ? So ... sucks to be you . ( clears throat ) Fine . Uh , here 's what we know about , uh ... Mr. Broden . He is 43 . Dead . Obviously . Uh , there 's a , uh , there 's a picture - here ... - Are you connected to the system ? Yes ! Camille : Hm . Mm . Well , he 's a handsome , sideways fellow . Yeah , moment . Oh , God . Give me that . Do I have to do everything around here ? Sit down , before you break something . ( sighs ) Broden . Ehh , shot to death . In his Beverly Hills penthouse . Most likely in his sleep . No sign of struggle . No sign of forced entry . The cops came when he didn 't show up for work or answer his cell . - What did he do ? - Divorce lawyer who was ... Heh , hashtag irony , was in the middle of his own divorce from Barbara Broden , fashion model . So the ex was a suspect . Anyone else want him dead ? Only about half the people on the cases he handled . Hm . Looks like he represented a lot of high-powered politicians , so we should consider that his death might 've been politically motivated . So , is that it , or ... ? Considering the three seconds you gave me to prepare ? Yes ... boss . Uh , okay , I think we should get ready to stitch . Let 's make this a quiet stitch , shall we ? Hey . Thanks for making me look like an idiot in there . Oh ... you didn 't need me for that . Look , I didn 't ask Maggie for this , all right ? I know you want the job , but you didn 't get it . So let it go . And then maybe you and I could work together and figure out whoever killed this guy ... okay ? Whoo . Nice speech . Am I dismissed ? Mm . - Hey . - Uh , please don 't tell me you 're worried about me stitching . There are things that 've been happening in the stitches that , yes , worry me . Can you just ... go play with your mice . Let me do what I do . Hey ! Look , regardless of us , I 'm in charge here , so I don 't like what I see , I 'm gonna call the bounce . ( quietly ) I could use some support right now , okay ? Not attitude . Cameron : Lights to 20 percent , please . I need a go , no-go for stitch neurosync . Life-Sci ? - Go . - Sub-Bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . - Com check , one two , one two . A full and supportive go . And ... I 'm sorry about before . Thanks for that . All right , let 's button this up like a Hollywood pre-nup . Induce stitch neurosync on my mark . In three , two , one , mark ! How long have you been screwing her for , Mark ? - It 's not like that . - Don 't you lie to me ! Kirsten : I 'm in Broden 's apartment . He and his wife are arguing , she 's accusing him of having an affair . How long have you been screwing her for , Mark ? I consulted with her , but I did it for you ! You did her , for you ! I swear ... give me a divorce , or I 'm gonna kill you . She just threatened to kill him if he didn 't give her the divorce . - You 're overreacting . - Look at me , Mark , look at me , Mark ! Okay , same place , different argument . - With his wife ? - No , different woman . Her face is wrapped in bandages . - Beat up ? Accident ? - The Mummy ? 1932 , 1999 or 2017 ? '32 . Of course . Uh , boys ? You met someone new , didn 't you ? - No . - Didn 't you ? She 's accusing him of cheating on her , too . He was a divorce lawyer . Fifty percent of everyone he worked with wanted to kill him a hundred percent of the time . I 'm still at Broden 's apartment . He is with yet another woman . I 'm getting a patchy neurosync again , just like last time . Heart rate and respiration are increasing . Kirsten , what 's goin ' on in there ? This is exactly what happened last time . Yeah , it is . Broden 's memory record shows his brain flooded with oxytocin . Ah ! The love hormone . That 's my favorite hormone . No , wait . It 's estrogen . Princess , you okay ? Yeah . Just , uh ... - Boss ? - I think she should bounce . I heard that . No , I 'm good . Just trust me . Okay , who 's the woman Broden 's with ? I don 't know , but there 's ... There 's something about her , it 's like ... he thinks she 's perfect . All right , I 'm moving you to the death memory . I 'm having trouble breathing . Broden 's in bed with Miss Perfect . He can 't breathe . Death memory in 40 seconds . Ayo : Respiration is struggling . ( trying to breathe ) Let me help . You know you can 't help me . Oxygen levels are critical . Cameron : Kirsten , I want you to bounce . I haven 't seen ... shooter . Move her . Move her closer to the death memory . - She 'll get there in 30 seconds . - She doesn 't have 30 seconds . Linus , do it ! ( keys tapping ) ( struggling to breathe ) Death memory in two seconds . ( gasp ) Total respiratory failure ! Kirsten , make the bounce ! ( gasping for air ) Relax , relax . Breathe . Breathe . ( sighs ) Hey , you okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . Cameron , are you okay ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . Did you see who shot Broden ? Broden died of asphyxiation . Wait . What ? He died and then he was shot ? Someone must really hate this guy . Unless they didn 't know he was dead when they shot him . So who did it ? The ex ? The Mummy ? Miss Perfect ? Or all or none of the above . Find anything more on Broden ? He was a pit bull . Real workaholic , impressive string of wins . Left a lotta angry ex-spouses out there . None more so than his own . Are divorce records public ? Not his , was a closed proceeding . If he was having an affair , the only ones who knew about it were Broden and his mistress . Oh , mistresses . The M.E. ' s still working up the tox screen , meanwhile , detectives found a 9mm at the ex-wife 's apartment . They 're running ballistics now to see if it matches that bullet from Broden 's body . Which didn 't kill him . Which someone still shot him with . Mm . What ? Say something managerial . Let 's bring in the ex , see what she has to say . - Atta boy . - Oh , was that so hard ? - ( elevator dings ) - Camille , wait . ( sighs ) I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm just really goin ' through it here . Me , too . That 's why I want you to pilot the next stitch . Does this have anything to do with your shakes ? Just do it . I was never good enough for Mark . Can you believe that ? Kept trying to ... improve me . Turn me into what he thought I should be . My clothes . My hair . My makeup . I even got a boob job . For him . Look at these ! They ruined my modeling career . Yeah . You can stop looking now . Yeah . ( Clears throat ) My clothes don 't hang right anymore . I haven 't booked work in two years . I know I did it to myself . But I really thought it would make Mark happy . And do you know the thanks I got ? He started shtupping the plastic surgeon . Miss Broden , security video places you at your husband 's home the night of his death . - And ? - And ... we found a gun at your place , the same caliber as the gun that shot your husband . Are you saying I killed him ? What we 're saying is that we 're running ballistics on your gun right now , and if the results are a match , and then you decide to confess , well , the judge will look at that like you were hiding the truth until you were trapped . She still had a key to the apartment , so she let herself in , found him alone in bed , went right up to him and ... popped him . Did she say if he was asleep ? Camille : She thought he was . But she also said that he was quiet , which was unusual , because Broden , in addition to his other fine qualities , snored , loudly . She also said he was having an affair . With a Dr. Sophia Torres , plastic surgeon to the stars . Okay , wait , so the suspects now are the ex , uh , Miss Perfect , the Mummy , and Doc Hollywood ? Well , the ex is an ex-suspect , at least for the potential murder . Could he have died of an allergic reaction to something ? Poisoned ? Maybe . All right , I 'll head back to Broden 's apartment , see if forensics missed anything . I can follow up on the poisoning angle with the M.E. , that would show up on a tox screen . And I 'll set up a meeting with Doc Hollywood . Kirsten , can I see you in my office , please ? Am I being fired ? Give it to me straight , boss . Okay . What 's goin ' on ? ( exhales ) Look , I 've got certain responsibilities here that make things a little ... - Awkward . - Yeah , I know , but I don 't want it to be , I don 't wanna be walking on eggshells with you . But I got a job to do . I know . And I 'm sorry about before . I 'm gonna be fully supportive of you , okay ? Don 't worry . Hm ? Linus : Knock it off , you two ! ( Groans ) - You 're right . - Mm . This is ... This is unprofessional . What ? No . Personally , I don 't care if you guys do it in the corpse cassette . I mean , knock it off if you wanna keep on stitching . Wait ... What 's goin ' on ? I figured out why Kirsten 's having trouble in the stitches . Why the neurosync is off . Oxytocin . At first , I thought it was due to the high oxytocin levels in the victim 's brain record whenever the stitch got a little , uh ... - you know ... - Steamy ? Mm-hm . But I found out that it wasn 't the victims ' steam that was fogging things up , it was yours . The stitches act like triggers . From what I can see , your brain chemistry has changed ever since you escaped your own memory loop . - It 's flooded . - With oxytocin ? Because ... Because of you . You stud . Oxytocin levels rise within the first six months of a relationship . The more physically intimate you guys are , the more it 's gonna mess with your ability to stitch . Okay , so then , where does that leave us ? You know , just like , holding hands and takin ' long walks on the beach ? Shorter walks would be safer . - Well , how do we fix this ? - I can program some kind of filter that 'll make the stitch a little less wonky . But if you guys wanna continue stitching , you 're gonna have to slow down . A lot . Hold hands . - Mm ? - Cuddle . Share a bed . But anything more than a stand-up double , and I have no idea what it 's gonna do to your ability to stitch . ( squirting ) ( phone ringing ) Camille ! I need a decontamination unit over to Broden 's right now . I think I 've been poisoned . Exploding coconut water . Apparently , Broden 's cuckoo for coconut water . Now , the container that Fisher found himself on the nasty end of was injected with a bacterium called clostidridium botulinim , which is the toxin used to create , boop , botox , which ingested , can cause paralysis , asphyxiation , and sometimes death . L 'chaim ! To Fisher . And his ability to keep his mouth ... shut . A skill I wish someone else was better at . Hm ? What ? Is this because I told you and Kirsten about the oxytocin thing ? What oxytocin thing ? Apparently , the more intimate Cameron and I get , the more flooded with oxytocin my brain is , and the more impaired my ability to stitch becomes . So you two can 't ... ( chuckling ) Hm . But back to the case . So , uh , Doc Hollywood put botox in Broden 's coconut water ? I mean , it would explain Broden asphyxiating . Doc Hollywood slips botox into the coconut water , Broden drinks it , asphyxiates , dies , then the ex shoots him . You can 't make this stuff up . W ... We don 't know Doc Hollywood did it for sure . Kirsten and I have a meeting with her tomorrow . Yeah . So do we have the rest of the night off ? Mm-hm . ( clears throat ) Just ... go to bed . ( clears throat ) Good night . Where you goin ' ? Home . To take the first in what promises to be a series of cold showers . So how was your night ? Lonely . Yours ? Not great . We can do this . We have to do this if we 're gonna save my mother . Oh , I know . I 'm with you . Please have a seat . Dr. Torres will be right with you . - Thank you . - Thanks . Hey , you find it a little odd that this whole place smells like money , yet there was no one in that waiting room ? Slow day ? A plastic surgery place in Beverly Hills with no patients is like Arkham without inmates . What does that mean ? Hello . I 'm Dr. Torres . ( clearing throat ) Uh , Dr. Torres , I 'm Agent Goodkin , this is Agent Clark . We 're with the , uh , NSA . So I 've heard . I also heard what happened to Mark . Don 't expect me to be all weepy about it . Uh , so I guess you don 't have , uh , very many fond memories from when you and Mr. Broden were dating ? Dating ? That would imply an emotional connection ? I 'm not sure Mark was capable of that . Do you find me attractive ? Excuse me ? Of course you don 't . I 'm a latex , botox , goddamn freak ! And do you know who I did this for ? - Mark Broden . - Why ? He kept pushing me and pushing me to change my look . Said he wanted me to be perfect . He always wanted more . Your facial surgeries . You must 've been pretty bandaged up . My whole face . I mean , you cannot imagine the pain that I put myself through . All for him . And now look at me . Do you really think , honestly , that somebody is gonna trust a plastic surgeon who looks like this ? And after you did this to yourself , he left you ? For someone new . Someone ... perfect . ( phone rings ) Hm , it 's uh , the o ... office , okay , I 'll be ... I 'll be right back , sorry . - Camille , hi . - How 's it going with Doc Hollywood ? Have any work done ? Make your nose a little less buttony ? Funny . Listen , Doc Hollywood is the Mummy , and she hated Broden . She could be our killer . The only thing she 's guilty of is working in an industry that perpetuates negative body image . I heard back from the M.E. There 's absolutely no evidence of botulism in Broden 's body . She may have botoxed his coconut water , but he never drank it . Wait , so ... neither the ex nor Doc Hollywood killed Broden ? - Apparently not . - So , what ? Natural causes ? Looking into it as we speak . ( crash ) Don 't ... move . Relax . Listen , Doc Hollywood , I 'm sure whatever ... - Dr. Torres ... - Shut up ! I had an old copy of the key , and I went over there last week , and I injected botox into that bastard 's coconut water . And you know what ? I 'm not sorry . He killed me ... the real me , a long time ago . And now we 're even . He never drank the water . You 're lying . Here 's what 's gonna happen : Me and ... Agent " Hair Extensions " and I , we 're walkin ' outta here , Try and stop us , and I swear I will pump him so full of Botox he 'll be dead before he hits the floor . Dr. Torres , Mrs. Reece called to cancel ... - You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine , I 'm just gonna need something for my worry lines . So , Doc Hollywood , aka the Mummy , put Botox in the coconut water last week hoping Broden would drink it . But he didn 't . So then , a couple days later , the ex comes over , puts a bullet in Broden , only he 's already dead , just not from the coconut water . So unless it was natural causes there 's really only one suspect left . Mm-hm . Miss Perfect . All right . Let 's stitch in and see if we can figure out who she is . Camille ? You 're up . Wait , you 're handling this stitch ? Cameron asked me to . He 's got the yips . He 's worried about you . And it 's getting in the way . He 's been under a lot of pressure lately . Yeah , and no way to release it . Don 't worry . I 'm sure he 'll be back in the saddle within a day or two . And of course I mean the stitch saddle , not the ... saddle . - You got this , right ? - Absolutely . Any ... Um ... any chance you and Cameron can have a good old-fashioned platonic date ... elsewhere tonight ? You met someone ? Something like that . Don 't do anything I wouldn 't do . Don 't you mean " can 't " do ? - Ooh . - No . Broden 's in bed with Miss Perfect . Linus ? Oxytocin filter seems to be kickin ' in . I ... I 'm havin ' trouble breathing . He 's ... starting to get into trouble . Okay , Camille , stay focused . I 'm totally focused . Relax , boss . Let me help . ( struggling to breathe ) You know you can 't help me . ( beeping ) Kirsten 's oxygen levels are dropping again . - Okay , I should take over . - I got it . Kirsten , I 'm keeping you from flashing forward this time . Tell us what you see . Broden 's on his feet . Barely . ( labored breathing ) No ! No , please don 't put me in there . Mark ... please . He has a hidden space ... hidden behind a painting . He 's forcing Miss Perfect into it . ( struggling to breathe ) - Death memory in 12 seconds . - Okay , that 's enough . Kirsten , make the bounce . ( struggling to breathe ) Broden kept Miss Perfect hostage in a secret chamber near his bed . There 's no indication on the police report of anything like that . She 's still in there . Camille , call Fisher . Go ! Hold on , miss , we 're gonna get you outta there ! ( thud ) Is she dead ? I 'm not sure how to answer that . Clearly , she couldn 't be the one who killed him . Linus : Not unless she 's the bride of Chucky . On a very special episode of The Stitch Lab Gone Wild ... We 're just examining her for clues . Sure , let 's go with that . Kirsten , you saw her in the stitch and said she was real . She was Broden 's fantasy of a perfect woman . In his mind , she was real . Or at least , he wanted her to be real . And so that 's why I saw her as real , too . Things are about to get a whole lot stranger . She 's equipped with audio and video recording capabilities . Aw , man , so he was recording himself with her ? Mmm , that 's it , I need a bucket . I 'd rather have a one percent chance with a real human than a 100 percent chance with a rubber one . Guys , Broden was with her when he started having trouble breathing . She might 've recorded what happened to him . Yeah ... we got a problem . We can 't view it here . I don 't even wanna know where you pulled that from . A slot ... from the back of her head . You see , Miss Perfect here doesn 't save data internally . It uploads to a cloud-based storage system . So who made it ? Her ? It ? Her ? Well , there 's a serial number on the CPU . Heh ! I kid you not . " Valley of the Love Dolls " ? So , I shouldn 't call them love dolls . - No . - Sex dolls ? - No . - So , what do we call them ? I don 't know . Didn 't you used to play with dolls as a kid ? Not this type of doll . ( chuckles ) Whoa , that must 've cost an arm and a leg . What ? I thought you found my sense of humor disarming . Seriously , Cameron , stop . Oh , I don 't know if I can . This place is a pretty target-rich environment . You must Agents Clark and Goodkin from the NSA . Yes . You 're Mrs. Underhill ? - Julie . - Mm . Oh ! It 's not gonna fall off on me , is it ? I 'm kidding . - Can you just stop it ? - It was a joke . Hey , thanks for agreeing to speak to us about your , uh , sex dolls ... love dolls ... Dolls d 'amour , shall we say ? We prefer to call them companions . And we call the company " Valley of the Love Dolls " because people seem to like old movie references . So , Agents Goodkin and Clark , you 're ... you 're investigating a homicide ? A possible homicide . One of your customers died two nights ago , Mark Broden ? If it was a crime , it 's possible that his companion recorded it , and we 'd like to look at any audio or video that was uploaded to your servers . Is that a problem ? We cater to a very elite clientele . Politicians , celebrities , judges . They expect us to protect their privacy . Yeah , Julie 's right . We don 't want to withhold information from the NSA , but , we can 't release anything without a court order . Just puts us in a very vulnerable position . No problem . We 'll come back with a warrant . Sorry for any trouble . - That 's okay . - Wanna see how we make our companions ? ( whistles ) Whoa . Sam : I started all of this as a hobby . But Jules here ... she is the real visionary . Turning my mad pastime into a business . Perfect team , huh ? Takes hard work and open communication . A little jealous devotion helps too . Julie : Not when it gets you a night in jail . Sam : That was a long time ago . We were at a bar in Tucson . This creep made some comment about my looks , and Sam belted him . I was so angry . Now I 'm just embarrassed . I need to talk to Jennifer about adding another enhancement . - Our employees are artists . - ( no audible dialogue ) You know , they put a lot of time and creativity into what they do . So , you know , they can get a little intense when customers make last minute changes . Like Broden did . He always wanted enhancements , and then he 'd just ... change it up , all over again . Spun everyone out until he was finally satisfied . Anyone , uh , spun out enough to kill him ? We 're artists . We 're not killers . Kirsten : Mm-hm . Who knew there could be so many , um , uh ... Enhancements ? Yeah . Well , that 's enough about that for tonight . - Mm . - So , what now ? Do you wanna stay here ? You wanna go back to your place ? Oh , Camille wanted the house to herself tonight . She 's having " company . " Oh , well . At least someone 's ... It 's so much harder than I thought it would be . What ... You thought us not being together would be easier ? You hear how that sounds , don 't you ? What ? How could you say that to me ? Do you know how long I waited for you ? Are you kidding me ? Not nearly as long as I was willing to wait for you , and I 'm still willing to wait for you - if that 's what you need , but ... - Okay , so what do you want from me ? You want me to give up on my mother ? No . I just don 't think your heart is breaking like mine is over the fact that we physically - can 't be together . - Really ? Is that what you think ? I don 't know . You tell me . Okay . You know , I think we should take the night off from each other . I think you 're right . Okay . ♪ These days I tell myself " Be open " ♪ ♪ Spent too much nothing but frozen ♪ ♪ And always afraid of crossing any of the lines ♪ Ooh ! And she plays guitar , too .

I 'm gonna run a material analysis on you . I 'll be gentle . ( typing ) Holy hell . Give me 20 more . Come on , dig deep . ( laughs ) It 's funny . I remember saying you could stay tonight , but I don 't remember asking you to be my personal trainer . This is good . What is it ? Uh , I don 't know what it 's called . Linus ordered it . Okay , coach . ( Exhales ) What is your assessment ? Well , I don 't believe that that was 20 reps , but you 're in great shape , and you need to work on your flexibility . I am hoping Linus will help me with that . - He 's coming over . Tonight . - Oh , really ? So , why aren 't you out with Dr. Scientific American ? Cameron and I had a fight . We 're ... mm , going through a rough patch . Two words : " makeup sex . " Yeah , well , we 're kinda not doing that right now . Really ? Is it a performance kinda thing ? ( laughs ) No . - Mm . - Mm . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know . Is this , um ... too soon , us doing the whole sister routine ? Maybe . But ... I like it . So do I. ( phone chimes ) Oh . I gotta go . Thank you , for dinner . Mm-hm . Well ... uh , I hope everything works out with Cameron . Thanks . Me too . ( laughs ) - This better be good . - This better be better than good . Ooh , it 's way better . I know who killed Broden . Who ? Miss Perfect . If this is a joke , Miss Perfect is gonna have company in there . Broden died from a severe allergic reaction to Ducoflex 9090 , the exact latex that Miss Perfect is made from . Wait , wait , so it wasn 't a murder but an accidental death ? Two real women wanted him dead , but the fake one is the one that killed him . You ... You really can 't make this stuff up . Oh , kids , well , before we all do the " case closed " happy dance , I just pulled up the order form for Miss Perfect from Broden 's emails . Apparently , she is the second companion he ordered from " Valley of the Love Dolls . " He returned the first one , because , and I quote , " she wasn 't beautiful enough . " This one was made to his exacting standards , including that she not contain Ducoflex 9090 . Apparently , he knew he was allergic to the stuff . May I , for a second ? Be my guest . Thank you . What was the model that Broden ordered and then returned ? Something called the " Desert Flower . " ( typing ) Sam said Broden made enemies at the company . Well , yeah , but if I 'm a chef at a restaurant , and someone sends back the Coquille St. Jacques I 'm not gonna go out and kill the guy . Unless you 're sleeping with Coquille . Huh ? Who does this remind you of ? Fisher : Ooh , no way . Fisher , what are you doing right now ? Going with you to the Valley of the Love Dolls ? I 'm going too . I started this with you , I 'm gonna see it through to the end . Mr. Underhill , thanks for meeting us so late . This is Detective Fisher , he 's LAPD , he 's helping us with the murder of Mark Broden . Is this about the warrant ? Still working on that . We think that one of your employees may have killed Mr. Broden . None of my people hated him that much . Mind if we have a look around ? No . Which one of these is the , uh ... " Desert Flower " ? Uh , we don 't have that model in production at the moment . How about the " Desert Flower " Broden returned ? She around ? We decommission any returned companions . There 's no market for them . Can 't imagine there would be . Well , what do you do with them ? Throw them away ? Melt them down ? We never destroy something as perfect as the " Desert Flower . " Look if there 's nothin ' else I really need to get back home to Julie . She was the , uh , the body model for the " Desert Flower " , yeah ? We ... We just , caught a peek at the catalog . There 's a striking resemblance there . You have an eye for beauty , Agent Goodkin . - Thank you . - Yes , Julie was the body model . She 's perfectly proportioned , so , why not ? - Cameron : Heh . - Must 've really bothered you when Broden returned her . Made me very mad . I can imagine . I mean , you went all beast-mode on a guy at a bar just for making a comment about her . Can 't imagine what you would do to someone who thought your wife was so disgusting that he couldn 't stand the sight of even being near her . Seriously ? Let him go . This syringe is filled with silicone . And I will pump it directly into Goodkin 's carotid artery if you don 't do exactly as I say . - Sam ... - Don 't ! No one has ever returned the " Desert Flower . " See , that 's when I knew that Broden , he had no idea , he had no idea what real perfection was . - Got him ? - Yeah , I got him . He didn 't deserve a companion like Julie . He didn 't deserve to be on this earth . Take him . ( gunshot ) ( groans ) No . More . Jabbin ' me . In . The neck !

( laughs ) Oh , I hate that I didn 't come up with that one myself . ( laughs ) I guess that perfect couple was far from . There 's no such thing as a perfect couple . Not even you and Stephanie ?

So what 's the answer ? Well , I 'll let you know . ( laughs ) But right now , we 're leaning ' hard into " yes . " See ya . You know , I still can 't go home . So where does that leave you ?

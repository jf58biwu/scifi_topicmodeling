 Robert : For centuries , mankind Has been the dominant species . We 've domesticated animals , locked them up , Killed them for sport . But what if , all across the globe , The animals decided : " no more " ? What if they finally decided to fight back ? Previously on zoo ... Rise and shine , jackson . We have a dozen impatient swedes Waiting for us to show them the rhinos . Abraham ! ( gun fires ) My name 's jackson . Chloe . Was your husband ... ? No , my husband is back in paris . Although he never became my husband . I learned he was having an affair . ( growls ) ( screams ) Excuse me , mitch morgan ? I 'm jamie campbell . We spoke on the phone . Right- - l.A. Telegraph . You 're the animal coroner ? Veterinary pathologist . You want to know what incited The lions to kill the zookeeper . Jamie : And the men downtown , yeah . That makes two of us . Apparently , there 's a rash Of missing cats in brentwood . This is an elementary school . Mitch : Yeah , but in the summer , it 's a day camp . And camp starts tomorrow . My father made all these tapes . He talks about a defiant pupil- - Indisputable proof that his theory was correct . Maybe my father wasn 't entirely crazy . Jackson oz , you 're under arrest . For what ? Interference with lawful hunting . You got to be kidding me ! ( lion growling softly ) ( cats meowing ) We should call animal control . And tell them what ? What ? This , the-the cats , The kids . Yeah , okay . This is weird , maybe even a little creepy , But cats have been known to socialize in groups . We even have a name for it . It 's called a " clowder . " A clowder ? Yeah , a clowder . Now , cats aren 't all that social , So you don 't see it too often , but ... Often enough they gave it a name . Mitch , there 's something going on here . Yes , there 's something going on here , but i can assure you There 's a rational explanation for it , all right ? Okay , then explain those lions from the zoo . Those lions did what lions do . They acted " lion-y . " Smug . Smug ? You don 't see it too often , But often enough that they gave it a name . All right , let 's call animal rescue , But you 're gonna do all the talking . You might reach an actual human being by tuesday . Operator : Thank you for calling the animal control hotline . To continue in english , press one . If this is an emergency , please hang up and dial 911 . For wild animals , please press one . For domestic animals , press two . Okay , here 's your explanation . Hello . Animal control . This is becca . Honeysuckle . How can i help you ? Yes , hello . Uh , i 'm calling to report a ... Um ... ( hisses , meows ) Hello ? Uh , could you send a unit To sunshine elementary school ? It 's on boon avenue in brentwood . There 's been a , um ... Ma 'am ? There 's a lot of cats in the trees . And i think that someone needs ... I 'm sorry . Cats ? Yes , cats . All right , we 'll send someone out . That would be great . Thank you so much . They 're on their way . Well , this should be embarrassing . ( cat yowls ) mitch : Whoa ! ( screams ) ( hisses ) I 'm telling you , it 's the honeysuckle . See , honeysuckle to cats is like ... You know , it 's like catnip . Do you think ... ? What ? They heard you calling the authorities ? ( moans ) ¶ ¶ ( purring ) Hey . Hey , kavimba . Listen to me , listen to me , listen . Look , you have to let me out of here . Honestly , jackson , I am of the mind to keep you here all week . I understand , but you can 't . You have to let me out now . You cannot continue to interfere with the tourists . We have to get back out there And figure out what 's going on with those lions . Look , you have to shut down the safari camps in the valley . At least until we can properly assess What the hell is going on out ... We go through this every time there 's a prolonged dry season . The herbivores go searching To quench their thirst in places they shouldn 't . The big cats follow , and sometimes people get hurt . This isn 't normal dry season wandering , and you know that . This entire town ... This entire region exists Because people want to see the lions ! You exist because the people want to see the lions ! My best friend died out there . And i 'm very sorry about that . I went to grade school with abraham . He was my friend , too . ( door opens ) Shut down the camps . Hey , there . Oh , hey . Are you leaving ? Yeah . They took my statement about the lions , And now i 'm going back to paris . Are you okay ? Yeah . You 're no longer under arrest ? No , not for the moment . Uh , listen , can i , um , get your contact information ? A phone , e-mail , Whatever . It was nice to meet you . Thank you for rescuing me . No , uh , chloe , uh , i-i think you misunderstand me . I 'm not ... There has to be a further investigation Of what happened out there , so i may need to ... Speak with you . Of course . Yeah . 0-6-35 ... What is it ? ( cell phone rings ) ( lion growling ) ( cell phone continues to ring ) What do you think of this , andraz ? You like him ? He 's a soldier . No . ( dog barks ) Woman : Lord , help us with this adoption . Man : What did you expect , luv ? He 's four . I just don 't know how we shall ever hope to succeed at this . Man : Uh , no , no , no . No , come , come , come , come . ( speaking slovenian ) shh , shh , shh . Hey , hey , it 's all right . Would it be possible , sir , To remove the dog from the lobby until we leave ? He good dog . He no bark . Appreciate that , but still . Shh , shh , shh . The last thing we need is for andraz to be bitten by a dog The first day he 's under our supervision . We have two more days before the adoption decree goes through . How are we going to entertain him for two more days ? He doesn 't even speak english . What do you want to do tomorrow , andraz ? Hmm , son ? ( boy chatters ) What ? Excellent choice . Tomorrow , we go . Is this where you saw him last ? In there . Kavimba : Go . Keep a sharp eye out . Yes , sir . ( grass rustles ) The driver 's body 's still in there , but abe 's gone . So now what ? Jackson : We keep looking . It 's fresh blood . It must be abe 's . Can 't be more than 24 hours old . There 's a trail of it . Oh , my god . What is it ? Oz , wait ! Go , go , go , go ! In the jeep ! In the jeep now ! Go ! Go ! ( engine starts ) He 's there , he 's there ! ¶ ¶ Whoa . Are ... Are you kidding me ? ( stammers ) I 'm two days late on the rent . It 's not my call . It 's my mother 's . This is the sixth month in a row you 've been late . No . No , no , no , that 's ... That 's impossible . Sixth ? Maybe the fifth , But definitely not the sixth . Listen , man , i could probably ... You know ... What ? Talk to my moms ? If you 'd maybe want to grab a drink . Maybe a meal ? You like soft-shell crab ? Dude , i 'd rather sleep in the street . Man : In that case , I 'm afraid i can 't help you . My mom says you gotta go . All right , we got you , buddy . We got you . Grab his legs . I got his arms . Okay . I got him . Jackson : Steady . Okay , steady . Steady . Careful . The ridge ... It 's all right . Hey , we got you . Take it easy , buddy . We got you . The ridge ... He 's saying something about the ridge . We 've got a problem . Lions ! There are too many . Too many for just one rifle . Unlodge his foot from there . ( lion growls ) there 's no time ! Nice and easy , nice and easy . Come on . We gotta go , we gotta go . I 'm going to shoot . You shoot , they 'll charge . Do not shoot ! Then hurry ! Careful , careful . He 's injured . If i don 't shoot now , We don 't stand a prayer ! You got him ? I got him . He 's in . Now let 's go . Now ! Come on ! Move ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! All right , let 's go ! Hold him still ! Come on , come on ! Drive ! All right , move ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Go , go , go ! I don 't understand why they 're not pouncing . ( snarling ) ( trainer shouts commands ) ( audience applauds ) ( low growling ) ( trainer shouts commands ) ( whip cracks ) ( applause ) ( trainer shouts commands ) You do know this is unnatural . What ? Forcing a creature to do something that ... Doesn 't come instinctively . ( drumroll plays ) ( whip cracks ) ( applause ) ( roars ) ( audience gasps , laughs ) Mitch : All right , so we 've been talking This whole hour about animal behavior . The norms And the deviations . That 's it for today . Don 't forget , your papers are due on friday . On which is the greater motivator : Hormones or pheromones ? ( low chatter ) You know , i still want to cut myself every time I even think about having to explain To those animal control officers Why we called them in a panic About a bunch of empty trees . I found something . There 's a chemical called 2,4-d . It 's known to affect the neurotransmitters In animals ' brains . Meaning it could cause aberrant behavior . Exactly . Now , 2,4-d is currently being used in pesticides Made by reiden global . The beef those lions were fed Came from cows that fed on grain That was treated with pesticides From reiden global . This is all ... Very riveting . Wait . There 's more . I was so hoping there would be . Last month , L.A. County started using a similar pesticide To contain a rare mosquito outbreak . Want to guess where ? In honor of conspiracy nuts everywhere , I 'm gonna guess brentwood . Yes ! Brentwood . Fine . Let 's just say , for a second- - For a second- - that you 're right And this chemical is causing the aberrant behavior . We could find out for sure By taking a closer look at the lion 's brains . Great . Let 's do it . Let 's nail these bastards to the wall . You are thoroughly obsessed with reiden global , Aren 't you ? I mean , in ways That go beyond just " i hate corporations . " Yeah , i am . May i ask why ? Because of what they did to my hometown . What 'd they do to your hometown ? They murdered it . ( people talking indistinctly in distance ) ( monitor beeping rhythmically ) Man : Jackson and the search party are back . Jackson : How is he ? Woman : Abe 's gonna be fine . No internal injuries . No bite marks . Several lacerations , some cuts and bruises . Can i see him ? In a couple of hours . I gave him a sedative . How is it possible ? How is what possible ? Somehow , those lions dragged him up into a tree . Well , that 's hardly inconceivable . They do it with their young , They drag them by the back of their necks . I mean , sure , Abe is considerably larger than a lion 's cub ... But it 's as though they purposely went Out of their way not to mortally wound him , Not to kill him . Why would they do that ? I don 't know . But i do know That he was incredibly lucky . ( sighs ) So , did you find the others ? Jackson : Yeah . 22 dead by the river delta . Woman : Oh , no . Well , if the bodies are gonna start arriving , I have to prepare the loved ones . Are you okay , jackson ? I 'm fine . Really , mom , I 'm fine . ( panting ) ( distorted roaring ) ( gasps ) ( panting ) ( roaring ) ( roars ) ( gasping ) ( phone ringing ) ( phone beeps ) Jackson ! Jackson ! How 's abraham now ? Your cousin 's gonna be fine . My father 's recordings ; did you bring them ? Yes , of course . Good . Come with me . I think there 's one about fight or flight . Do you know what i 'm talking about ? Yes . I 've watched them all . They 're brilliant . Fight or flight . Do we run Or do we strike back ? That 's ... Robert : What do we do in the face of fear ? Do we run Or do we strike back ? This question resides in the most primal aspect of the brain , Both humans and animals alike . But it won 't be long Before the animals realize That they no longer need to flee . That they have the capacity And the capability to rule the planet . That they no longer need to fear mankind . ( squeals ) See ? It 's not scared of me . It knows ... That all they need to do is fight And they can take down the human race . ( monitor beeping rhythmically ) Hey , rafiki . How you feeling ? I suppose i 'll live . As long as my beloved doctor Doesn 't tell me otherwise . 120 / 80 . You 're perfect . ( chuckles ) You see that ? I am perfect . Kukaa karibu . You saved my life , rafiki . I only did what you 'd do for me . I don 't know . All those lions . I think i would have left you and ran . ( chuckles ) What happened out there , abe ? How did you end up in that tree ? I went into the safari bus , And i saw ... A man lying in the aisle , dead . That 's why i didn 't see the lion come in . ( roaring ) So i made my peace . It was my time . That 's okay . Everyone has their time . At least i would be with my baby brothers again . ( roars ) ( roaring ) Abraham : I must have bumped my head , Because the next thing i remember , He was dragging me . And then i realized his plan for me was worse than death . I was to be food for the pride . But they didn 't eat me just then . Instead , they dragged me up into the tree That you found me in . ( low snarling ) ( roaring ) And they retreated up the ridge And waited and watched . I came in and out of consciousness , And i prayed that i would die Before they had decided they had toyed with me enough And that it was time to feed . Next thing i knew , you were there helping me down . I don 't think that they were ever going to eat you . I think that they wanted us to find you . I think that they wanted someone to spread their message . I don 't understand . Spread what message ? That they 're no longer afraid of us . ( gasps quietly ) ( snarling , roars ) Polnjene zivali . That 's it , andraz , the show is over . Polnjene zivali . What 's he saying ? Don 't know . I 'm suddenly wishing some genius had thought to invent An english-to-slovenian smartphone app . ( chuckling ) : Yeah . Andraz . Andraz ? Andraz ! Andraz ! Andraz ! Andraz ! Andraz ! ( tigers snarling ) ( low snarling ) ( people talking indistinctly in distance ) ( hooting , screeching ) I 'm sorry , but the lions aren 't here- - they 've been destroyed . Mitch : What , already ? Yeah , both corpses last night . On whose orders ? Uh , the city council . Or maybe the zoo board . I 'm not sure . It means nothing . Oh , come on . Are you still living in venice , mitchell ? Uh , yes . It 's convenient to westwood ... Classes . I love it there . Tell me , mitchell , uh , could we get The same results from a different lion That was fed here at the zoo ? A live one ? There are certain tests i could run that wouldn 't be harmful . What is this all about ? To be honest , we 're trying to get to the bottom Of what happened with those lions the other day . Zookeeper : Yeah , there 's a full investigation underway , But i kind of think it 's a waste of time . Every now and then , lions just act " lion-y . " Wow , did you guys go to the same orientation seminar ? Just don 't want it to happen again . Yeah , of course . Mitchell , um ... Do you think maybe it might be possible for aspen To arrange for us to borrow a lion ? Wh-what ? No . No , just for a little bit . No , that 's not ... Just to run those tests . I don 't think that 's ... Yeah , sure . Of course . Anything to help . ( rooster crowing , chickens clucking ) " kukaa karibu . " I 've heard you and abraham say that before . It 's something his mother taught him . It means stay close and take care Of the people you care about . You 're very good at that . What if he was right ? Who ? Robert . Is that where you got that idea About the lions no longer being afraid of us ? From your father ? I was watching the recordings he made , okay ? At least the ones i have . Now , the flash drives are numbered " one of 12 , " " two ... " Jackson . But i only have five flash drives . Where are the other seven ? Jackson . Your father 's ideas were rejected By every one of his peers . Harvard revoked his chair . What if they 're wrong ? What if they 're all wrong ? He was the laughingstock ... What if everyone else is wrong ? 22 people are dead from those lion attacks . Twenty-two . What if something in his work could keep Other people from dying ? It can 't . Because there was no basis in fact For any of it . Your father lost his tether on reality . He was delusional . Okay , i know . He was ... I know , i know . It 's the reason i made you take this job , remember ? It 's the reason we 're here , to get away from him ; i know . Then why are you bringing all of this back ? I 'm not . I think it 's already here . ( low snarling ) ( snarling ) Man : Andraz ! Andraz ! Andraz ! You scared us . You scared us , all right ? ( sighs ) you scared us , andraz . Polnjene zivali . Man : Polnjene zivali . Polnjene zivali , yes ? Yeah . ( chuckling ) : Thank you . ( speaking slovenian ) Apparently , it means " souvenir . " ( cooing ) ( speaking french ) Chloe . ( speaking french ) ¶ ¶ ( sobbing ) ( sobbing continues ) What ... ? What is it ? Dear lord . I need to see my son . Right away . 14 years out here , i 've seen five bodies mauled by lions . Today , nearly two dozen . It 's tragic . Yes , it is . But that 's not what concerns me . Lions kill for two reasons , But these people , they didn 't pose a threat , And they weren 't killed for food . Something else . When lions kill , they go for the throat . It 's quick , it 's efficient . But these bodies , Every one of them has the femoral arteries slashed . These people , they died slow painful deaths . But it was several lions . Several . How would they all ... ? Change the way they kill ? They wouldn 't . And yet , they did . You 've always had a lot in common With your father , jackson . Even when you were a child , you were ... Brilliant like him And curious and determined . We 're all a product of nature and nurture , Our genes and our experiences and I 've already lost One of the men i love to this . I know it 's irrational ... But now i 'm afraid i may lose the other . Tokyo ? What 's in tokyo ? The flash drives that you have , They were sent to us by harvard . They were among the things that your father left behind When they asked him to resign . But after he died , I got this address from the executor of his will . At some point , Your father found his way to japan . Whatever is left of his research , This is where you 'll find it . If something 's really going on with the lions , I 'm not just leaving you here . Once it 's safe , Then i 'll go . I don 't think there 's time for that . Look , i 'm not saying That i think your father was right . In fact , i pray to god he wasn 't . But if he is ... ( scoffs ) ... This isn 't gonna stop with just the lions . ( thick accent ) : Okay . One final paper . Good . Cestitke . Congratulations . Congratulations ! ( laughs ) I 'm a mum . You 're a mum . ( laughs ) I 'm a mum . ( dog barks ) Polnjene zivali . ( speaks slovenian ) ( growling ) Come here , pup . Oh ... Don 't fear , I 'll get it . It 's okay . Come here . Come here . Daddy will find it . Okay ? Okay . ( horns honking , traffic sounds ) Max ! Come here , boy ! ( claps hands , whistles ) Max ! ( quietly ) : Damn it . ( whining ) Max ! Come on . Would 've been better to shave him , But i didn 't think to bring a razor . All right . Make yourself useful . Attach these to the electrodes . Red to red , yellow to yellow , And so on . Do they teach you this in vet school ? Nope . Med school . You went to med school , too ? I did . But i gave it up once i realized that ... That meant doing what doctors do : Primarily dealing with people . ( beeping , gasps ) ( monitor beeping rhythmically ) It works . That was funny , By the way . What 's it saying ? It 's , uh ... Spiking in the hyper-gamma frequencies . What does that mean ? I don 't know . Because lion 's brains don 't have hyper-gamma frequencies . ( cub snarling quietly ) Mitch ... He 's awake . ( cub snarling quietly ) ( phone rings ) hello . Mitch : It 's me . I think i underdosed the lion cub . I gave him 3.9 milligrams of zolazepam 20 minutes ago . Should 've kept him asleep for hours , But he 's-he 's waking up already . ( whispering ) : Would you hold-hold him still ? I 'm trying . I just want to make sure It 's okay to give him another dose . Yeah , that 's fine . Uh , but i 've gotta go . We 've got a bit of a crisis here . For some reason , all the big cats are going crazy . Crazy how ? I don 't know . ( lions snarling ) About 20 minutes ago , they started howling And they haven 't settled down since . ( snarling ) Mitch : That started at 10 : 00 ? Yeah . Why ? Mitch : Nothing . Coincidence . ( roaring ) ( roaring over phone speaker ) ( roaring ) Uh , mitchell , i have to go . What was that ? I don 't know . But i think- - And i can 't believe i 'm about to say this- - I think these lions are ... Communicating with each other . Long-distance . ( chain rattles ) All right . Stay . ( low growling ) Stay . Stay . That 's a good boy . ( whining ) ( snarling ) ( growling ) ( growls ) ( barks ) ( barking ) ( snarling ) Rafiki . Hey . Should you be out here ? No . Not at all . But i spoke to your mother And she told me about japan . Abe ... No . Kukaa karibu , rafiki . If you go , I go with you . I don 't think so . I appreciate ... You have known me for a dozen years now . Do you know me to be a man that is easily dissuaded ? Besides ... I think japanese women are very sexy . ( laughs ) Yeah . I 'm sure they 're gonna find you sexy , too . In a beaten-up kind of way . Yes . I am a very rugged man . ( laughs ) ( stifles a groan ) ( engine starts ) ( dogs barking , howling ) Andraz : Dada ? That 's right . Dada . Mama . Mama . Dada , mama . Yes . ( scratching at door ) ( dogs barking , howling in distance ) Man : Chloe tousignant ? Oui . That 's not important . What is important is africa , And what happened to you there . The second matter Involves dogs in slovenia . I have reason to believe the two events are connected And that you may be uniquely suited to help us . Who are you ? Who are " us " ? If you will come with me , I 'll tell you everything . But we should go straightaway . I 'm afraid- - And this is not an overstatement- - That the fate of the world May hinge on it .

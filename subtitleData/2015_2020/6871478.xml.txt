 [ narrator ] It is the year 4032 . Man 's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations known as Abbies , [ screeching roar ] That rule the earth . One man saw the catastrophe coming . He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years and defy mankind 's extinction . Surrounded by mountains and protected by an electric fence , the last of humanity left alive on Earth , do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines . [ narrator ] Previously an Wayward Pines ... - Where are we ? - You 're in Wayward Pines . [ Kerry ] Damn it , stop the car . He 's gonna want to bring you in and talk things through . [ Jason ] I am doing what Pilcher would 've done . [ Ben ] Jason ! Wanna stop the killing , we 're here . Take them . - First Generation can never harm- - - I 'm not harming Ben . And Theo ? He 's skilled . Listen , Rebecca , you have to leave right now . Somethings rotten here . Clear rules , severe punishment . Clear and severe . [ Theo ] What 's on the other side of the fence ? [ Xander ] Mario ! Mario ! What are you doing ? Mario , come back ! Who would join us on this adventure ? This journey into the future . Where we would ... rebuild not just the town , but humanity . Should we pick the brightest and the best in society ? No . No , they had had their time and ... they had nearly destroyed the planet . So instead , we selected the farmer , the teacher , the doctor , the cop . Men and women who know how to work . For there was so much work to be done . But for those who break the rules , there can be no compromise . They must face the consequences of their actions in public . [ Jason ] For everyone to see . Why are they going ? Switch cameras . [ Abbies growling ] [ girl 1 ] What 's happening ? [ girl 2 ] What are they doing ? [ boy ] Why are they doing this ? [ Jason ] Mario . Here . - What are they doing ? - We 're not sure , sir . Send response units now . Get the jeeps ready at the checkpoint , I 'm on my way . - We 're coming , too . - Yes , sir . - Jason . - We will be fine . We need to see what 's really happening . Cut off the feed . I don 't want people to panic . Yes , sir . [ Rebecca ] Hey ! Turn it on . Turn that back on . Please , my husband 's out there . Hey ! [ Abbies growling ] We got to move . What ? And you think it 's better out there ? No , no , no . We just split up . We got a better chance if we draw them in different directions . [ growling ] [ grunting ] Okay . [ grunts ] [ screams ] [ Abbies growling ] [ screams ] All right , I want a team going up the north side of the wall . I want a team going down the south side . [ Kerry screams ] Kerry ! No . Medic ! Medic here ! - Do something . - Okay , okay . Oh , God . The hospital , I think we need to get her to the hospital . [ gunfire ] Radio the hospital . Tell them we 're coming . - Yes , sir . - Hang on , Kerry . Should I tell them to prep for surgery ? Sir ? Sir ! We 're giving her fluids now . She has deep lacerations and I think , possible internal injuries . Look , I don 't have the experience for this , sir . I 'm sorry . Mario . Go find Dr. Yedlin . The cameras spotted him over by section six . - The crops ? - Yes , hurry . Come on , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! [ growling ] [ soldier ] Open fire ! Put them down ! [ gunfire ] [ soldier ] You okay ? [ Jason ] Dr. Yedlin ! It 's Kerry . She lost a lot of blood when the Abby attacked her . There might be internal- - You need to stop ignoring my questions . - No , forget about your- - - Answer my questions ! Where 's my wife ? Forget about your wife . You 're doing this right now ! I 'm not doing anything until you- - Till you explain all this . You want to die ? Is that it ? You , Kerry , your wife , all of us . We will all die . You have no idea what 's going on here . Then who 's gonna operate , huh ? You ? Or maybe one of your pregnant 12 year olds . You 're gonna get Rebecca , bring her here , and tell me everything that 's going on . Now . - Oh , my God . - Rebecca . Oh , thank God you 're okay . Oh , my God . Okay . That 's enough . Doctor , let 's go . I told you , that was part one . She 's right in there . Just get her stabilized , - and then we 'll talk . - I don 't believe you . - Doctor . - I want to know where we really are . I want to know what that fence is about . I want to know what those things are outside that fence , and I want to know how an underage cretin ... gets to be in charge of all this . - Theo , don 't . - You have a duty . You want me to beg ? Is that it ? You were kidnapped in Hawaii and placed in cryogenic suspension . Humanity 's gone extinct because we destroyed the environment , and the planet 's been overrun by evolutionary aberrations . The fence protects us from them . People in this town are the only humans left . Anywhere . Ever . - I want the truth ! - [ Rebecca ] For God- - No , no , please . Please stop it . Please . - Mario ! - Stop . No , no . Please , for God 's sake . - Rebecca , tell him . - Theo . Yeah . Theo . Theo . - She 's dying in there ! - Listen to me , Theo . Just do what you need to do to save her , okay ? Just do this . Okay . Let him go . [ monitor beeping ] You 're gonna be okay . You 're very lucky . That 's what he says anyway . The Abbies . - Did more get over ? - No . We used the grenades and they retreated . We secured the fence . Everything 's okay . And what about the harvest ? Are we gonna be able to get the food in ? What about the other rebels , the ones who surrendered with Ben ? No , no , no , I don 't want you to worry about any of that . You need to rest . - Thank you for taking care of me . - Of course . - You know I always will . - Where 's Dr. Yedlin ? I should thank him , too . You don 't need to thank him . He 's just doing his job . Barely . Who lives here ? You hung ? Must be . I 'll see what we have . It 's probably not much . So , rations get delivered on Tuesdays here . But with you here , I guess we 'll get double . Rations ? It 's been less and less . No . It 's part of the reason that caused the rebellion . But we 've been told there 'll be a harvest soon . I know this is very hard for you , Theo . But it 's also hard for them , you know ? To find the right balance between not enough information and too much . You know , when you wake up and you 're taken out of the cryogenic pods- - You don 't believe this . You don 't believe any of this . At first , I didn 't . It was very difficult for me to know what to believe , but , you know , over time I 've learned to accept this . Over time ? Over the day you 've been here ? I 've been here three years , Theo . I live here . You coming to the meeting ? Not if it 's about the war . The rebellion is over . Jason is returning everything back to normal . You 're one of Pilcher 's protégés . I thought you 'd be happy . I am happy . Can 't you tell ? Jason wants to harvest the crops . They 're ready , right ? - They look ready . - Yes . We delayed too long already because of the rebellion . - We shouldn 't wait . - What about the Abbies ? They 're climbing over their own dead bodies to reach us . They 're willingly sacrificing themselves . There 's nothing about this type of behavior in Pilcher 's years of research . It 's like nothing we 've seen since we 've been in Wayward Pines . We planted out there because we needed to . Because the chemical levels in the soil inside the fence changed . So we can get the food ... as long as we can protect the people getting it ? CJ , you know I trust you . Are you sure about this ? We 'll protect the harvesters . We have to . How ? We 've rigged some flame throwers already . If they get too close , we 'll torch them . - You can 't control fire . - We can control it . It 's elemental . It 's alive and unpredictable . It 's like trying to control the wind or the sun . Their behavior has changed . We have to change , too . It 's time to push back . Harder than we ever have before . And have faith that it won 't break us . You say three years . I saw you three days ago . I saw you three days ago at a bungalow . Do you remember the bungalow ? - Do you remember what you said ? - None of that matters . You said there was a storm and something hit my head . - It was a long time ago for me . - How severe was that injury ? - Did they induce a coma ? - They did not . Were we in Hawaii ? - Yes , we were in Hawaii . - Really ? Where 'd I get this ? We married ? Theo , just forget about all of this , okay . I know this is not a grand mal because I- - Theo , are you listening to me ? Are you listening ? Listen to me . None of it matters , okay ? All that matters is that we are here . And we need to figure out a way how to survive in Wayward Pines - like everyone else . - " Everyone else " ? There is no everyone else . This is not real . It 's some hallucination . Did that feel real ? You don 't feel pain in a hallucination , Theo . Theo . You 're alive . [ knocking ] We have to answer . Hi , Nancy . Everything okay ? Trey can 't catch his breath . It 's been days now . He says he hurts . Somethings wrong . Oh , I 'm so sorry . - Everything 's a little bit crazy- - - I know . But I heard there 's a doctor in town again . You 're a doctor , aren 't you ? - Yes . - Will you help us ? [ announcer ] Good morning , Wayward Pines . The sun has risen on a new day . Let 's celebrate our good fortune and continue to live our lives as normal . Good morning , Wayward Pines . Good morning , Dr. Yedlin . I 'm Arlene Moran . I 'm the receptionist here at the hospital . And I just wanted to say I 'm happy to help you with all your medical needs . I mean , I 'm not ... really a medical professional or anything . Didn 't I see you the other night ? - Wasn 't that you ? - Yes . That was me . I was getting a little tune up . I have to get them every once in a while . It helps even me out . But then , I 'm good to go like now and I 'm just cooking ' with gas , so ... anything you need . Dr. Yedlin . You 've got a lot of patients this morning . We 're ready when you are . And just to say , sir , what you did in there with Kerry , - it was just- - - Please stop that . Thank you . Rebecca . Hey . Theresa , how are you doing ? - Sorry , I 'm just still- - - Jason put Ben outside the fence . - What ? - This is what people are telling me . How can that be ? He is First Generation . They 're both First Generation . That 's Jason . Your husband was out there too , right ? - Yeah . - And he 's alive . So maybe Ben 's alive . It 's ... it 's possible . Yeah . It 's possible . Okay . I need you to tell your husband to come and see me when he gets home , all right ? I need to know what he knows . - Rebecca , please . - Theresa , I ... Rebecca . You have lost people too , I know that . But you just got somebody back . Please help me . [ groaning ] Quite a sight , isn 't it ? Don 't worry , it can 't hurt you . Remember , the only good Abby ... ls a dead Abby . Excellent . Now , this is one of five Abby cadavers that we 're currently studying at our newly expanded research center . We also have three live Aberrations . No , no , don 't- - Don 't worry . They are caged with the highest level of security , and they 're often heavily sedated . With Jason 's encouragement , and support for our programs , we are learning more every day . And the more we understand , the better chance we have of learning their weaknesses , right ? Now , I know that I 'm not here with you at the academy in the way that I was , now that I 'm directing all the scientific research , but if you have any questions- - Did you get that off the pile ? That pile they made , trying to get in . Now , where did you hear about that , Frank ? - Are they gonna do it again ? - No . No , no , no . Not now that they 've seen how we defend ourselves . Remember , kids , Wayward Pines works when we work together . As long as we stay unified , we don 't let ourselves be sucked in by any of the unpleasantness and the divisiveness that some members of our community are trying to cultivate . If we stick together , we 're perfectly safe . In Wayward Pines , we are perfectly safe . Well , his tongue 's pretty swollen . Your mom tells me you hurt a little bit . Would you show me where ? My arms , too . The joints . Yeah , these are signs of malnutrition . What 's the situation at home ? I give him all the rations first . I understand that the food supply is low right now , but , what is your access to the basics ? Multivitamin or ... Not everyone qualifies , Dr. Yedlin . How does one qualify for a vitamin ? Okay . Well , we can fix this . We 'll tube him and hydrate him . Call the gastroenterologist and- - Except we don 't have a gastroenterologist , so ... I will do it . A lot of patients , Doctor . Dr. Yedlin . I 'm sure it 's quite an adjustment . But with your help , soon , the residents will be fully trained- - Do you understand the condition , the people of your town are in ? It 's a good thing you 're at work then . That 's what we do here in Wayward Pines . Well , it doesn 't make a whole lot of sense what you do here . That 's no business of yours . Except it is , because you keep sending patients to me . It 's not your job to tell me how to run things . To even suggest how to run things . I took an oath , so it 's my job to heal people . In fact , I 'm the only one who can do that job . Aren 't I ? How 's Kerry this morning ? Look , you can tell me all the stories you want about what this place is . And I accept some version of it , fine , maybe . But what I won 't accept is the reality that I wake up in a dictatorship . - You see , back in the real world- - - This is the world now . Then I would try harder to protect whatever shred of humanity 's left . You 're lecturing me now . I think you need to watch your tone with me , Doctor . You don 't think I can do your job ? That 's fine . But we both know you can 't do mine . He just got here . I 'm not taking suggestions from him . And you don 't have to . But a small town doctor , the small town doctor , people are gonna look to him for answers . On a lot of things . It 's just common sense . - How do we stop it ? - We can 't stop it . But he 's not a threat if you control it . I 'll help you . Wayward Pines has been here before . There can 't be factions or dissenting voices . There can only be one person in charge . Otherwise it all falls apart and we disappear . I know . Just work with him , Jason . You don 't want to start this kind of fight . It isn 't worth your time . You 're right . He isn 't worth it . Should never have brought him out . Well , then I 'd be dead . Our lives are worth his arrogance . I 'm still here today . You 're still here . That 's what this town needs . He 's difficult , yes . You and I both know he 's necessary to the survival of this town . I know . Hi , Dr. Yedlin . Hello . Rebecca left about an hour ago . Rebecca ? She was your wife , right ? Rebecca is my wife , yes . - Who are you ? - Lucy Armstrong . She 's my boss . Come on . Hey . No longer an architect , huh ? You 're a beautician ? Yeah , that 's the job I was assigned here . Just like you were assigned yours . Here ? That 's what I was told to do , Theo . And sometimes in order to survive , you have to do what they tell you to do . Your work meant everything to you . I was on Main Street today and I saw an ice cream parlor called McConigles . Wasn 't that the name of your favorite professor at Harvard School of Design ? I wondered if you had anything to do with that . You 're just being paranoid now . [ chuckles ] Why wouldn 't I be paranoid here ? 'Cause it won 't get you far . Two years ago , the ice cream parlor burned down . They asked for my help to reconstruct it . And they let me pick the name . That 's all there is to it . It 's light activity tonight and a full moon . The mountain will be spotting anything out there . We clear the fields , and we station the flamethrowers here - and here . - What if the fire draws them in ? We have never used fire on them before . We don 't know what they understand about it . Well , tonight they 'll learn . [ CJ ] We 'll have soldiers at ten foot intervals . We 're in and we 're out . Remember , the lives of everyone in Wayward Pines depends on us getting that food . [ shrieks ] - They 're not stopping . - Use the flame throwers . [ screeching ] They 're retreating . - The fields are clear . - Copy that . Move the harvesters in . [ CJ ] We 've cleared cornfield B. The first six trucks on their way back . Over . - Take me back . - Ben ? Please . Please , hide me in a truck . I 'm First Generation ! You can 't just leave me here to die ! Hey , he ' ! [ alarm blaring ] No ! This is Ben Burke , on the outside . This may be my last message . Sir , you better see this . Mom , I know you didn 't always approve of me taking things as far as I did , - so , I 'm sorry . - He 's alive . And I know that Dad wasn 't perfect , but he taught me to fight for the things that I believed in . You both did . And ... I just wanted to make you proud and do what was best for everyone in Wayward Pines . I 'm sorry that it wasn 't enough . Jason , if you Te watching this , you know that this is a mistake . You put me outside the fence , which is a death sentence , and you know that . - Pilcher said that one member ... - Turn it off . - ... of the First Generation ... - Sir ? - ... Cannot harm another member . - Turn it off now . If any good comes of this , at least , maybe the people can see the kind of leader that you really are . - Good job out there . - Thank you , sir . Good job out there . [ Theresa ] Did you see Ben ? Did you see Ben ? Did you see him ? No , I didn 't . I 'm sorry . It is true what they say about First Generation , isn 't it ? Isn 't it the first rule ... that you can never harm each other ? Isn 't that right ? Mrs. Burke , I understand that you 're- - He is out there , and he may be alive . So , why are you guys sitting in here not doing anything ? I know it 's upsetting , ma 'am , but we 're just following orders . How can you let Jason do something like this ? Please do something . Do something . Do something , please ! - Get her home . - Damn it ! She 's right . It 's the first rule . - He fought against us . - But he 's still one of us . - We can ask Jason , we could go- - - No ! No , he 'll just say no . Let 's go . Breathe in . Breathe out . I 'm fine . I need to get back to work . Give us the room . Uh , get out . You don 't feel any pain ? I know what pain is . I 'm fine . And thank you for what you did when I was hurt . That 's my job , right ? Unless , of course , you need a barber somewhere . He listens to you , doesn 't he ? He does what Pilcher would 've wanted . And he does what 's right . But you have his ear . I should hope so , Dr. Yedlin . Do you have a point ? No point . Just trying to figure out how it all works here . Make this hospital work . You can leave the rest to us . You should eat , Kerry . I 'm trying . Tonight , the people of Wayward Pines are gonna eat real food . The fence will hold , the rebels are crushed . The town is starting to finally come back together . Theresa 's running around asking about Ben . - I know . - The rules , Jason . No First Gen can harm another First Gen. - We were taught that . - I didn 't harm him . I exiled him . Abbies did the harm . He tried to turn us against each other . You might have to explain that to some people . I shouldn 't have to . He wasn 't really First Gen , anyway . He came in late , he 's not an original . I 'm not an original , either . That 's different . You 're different . You 're loyal . You 're mine . [ rustling ] Mario , is that you ? Where 's Ben ? Xander , it 's me . Where is Ben ? Damn it , I am his mother . Where is he ? I 'm sorry , Dad . [ growling ] Infectious disease . Didn 't get it . Didn 't care . I don 't think I ever delivered a baby . Not on my own , anyway . Can 't remember the last time I set a broken bone . In your residency , you did a bit of everything . You 'll get it back . My index finger . Up in the Sierras . White Bear Hot Spring . That was Eden . Well , we were naked . And the bungalow . Is that where you still are ? Your head ? When I woke up here , I thought you were dead . And now you 're here , sitting with me , you 're alive . I am happy about it . But that 's as far as I can go . For now . Look . At what ? Nothing . I 've checked all the cameras , not an Abby in any of them . This has never happened before . Is it possible ? They 're gone . [ growling ]

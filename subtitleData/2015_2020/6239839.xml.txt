 Molly : My name is molly woods . I 'm an astronaut . My husband john , a robotics engineer , Created a lifelike robot called a humanich . We adopted the prototype as our son . His name is ethan . Everything changed when i went to space on a 13-month Solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . Molly : I 'm pregnant . How is that even possible ? The child- - part human , Part alien- - was unlike anything The world had ever seen . How 'd you get so big so fast ? And he was dangerous . Eventually ... Run ! ... I lost both of my sons ... Ethan ! Mom ! ... And my husband . Some people say i 've gone crazy . This is a cover-up ! That 's what this is ! Get your hands off of me ! I say there 's more to the story . It 's up to me to find the truth , Before it 's too late . Previously on extant ... This isn 't a murder investigation . It 's an invasion . Shepherd : We thought he was dead , But we were wrong . We 've used an accelerated aging program To create an image of what he looks like now . Molly : I think i 'm going crazy . I 'm blacking out , And i 'm ending up in places that i have no idea how i got there . Get dressed ! You 're not my mom ! Anna : If you cannot get him under control , We will give him to someone who can . Julie : Okay , i can reprogram him . Good night , rabbit . Good night , mom . Anna : We would like this new breed of humanichs To be stronger than we are . ( shouting ) let go ! Taylor recommended a drone strike . Give me eyes on the target . Velez : There 's molly woods . Stop . Sir , what do we do ? Launch . ( rock music playing ) Some things are better left alone ! That 's all i 'm saying . Analog audio technology was developed at a time When people cared about warmth and depth . It came of age when music defined people 's lives And foreshadowed the alienation of modern man . Something must be pretty special here . They 're sending in the government spooks To pick him up in the morning . I got something more mellow right here . This is a classic . You like sad songs ? I work in a morgue , don 't i ? Here , take that off . ( sloshing sounds ) ( cracking ) ( sloshing ) ( thuds ) Oh , dude . ( crying ) ( indistinct chatter ) Just put your eye up here for the key scan And it 's all yours , mrs . Nelson . This matter is , uh , well , uh , delicate . Ha ! Isn 't it always ? Oh , i should 've known you 'd laugh at me . ( crying ) ( slapping sound ) Pull yourself together . I can 't stand ... Man : Ag5 , an asteroid 140 meters wide ... ( overlapping voices ) ( overlapping voices continue ) ( overlapping voices continue ) Man : ... American west , a lone coyote hunts for prey . ( gunfire ) ( overlapping voices , gunfire ) ( dance music playing ) Is this seat taken ? It is now . Man : Drone on final approach . Icarian-4 , inbound 90 seconds . ( loud clinking ) You haven 't told me your name . Ahdu . That 's beautiful . I 'm molly . It 's good to see you , molly . Have we met before ? It 's a small universe . ¶ ah ... ¶ We 've lost visual , sir . Shepherd : I need eyes . Get me that picture back . Working on it , sir . Seems to be some sort of interference . Maybe we should go somewhere a little more quiet ? Lead the way . ( talking indistinctly , laughing ) Come here . Just when i thought we had something special going on . Hey , molly . You move , i shoot your kneecap off . You think i was gonna let you get away from me twice ? Now , the way i got it figured , You either really needed to get laid Or you know who the killer is . Hell , maybe you 're even in on it . Put the gun down . I don 't think so . Oh , my god . It 's you . But ... How could this be possible ? Oh , no , no , no ! Don 't ... Don 't hurt him ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Right now . ( panting ) What is that sound ? ( drone approaching ) down ! ( explosion ) ( woman screaming in distance ) ( coughing ) Are you okay ? Where is he ? ( grunting ) Who is he ? ( panting ) My son . Man : Don 't move ! Put your hands in the air ! Right now . Clear the area . Sir , we have dr . Woods . You 've got an artifact in her scanning process That 's generating noise . Just a simple question Of turning down the volume . Cool ? Problems ? Problems are just possibilities . Ethan : Hey , mom , Can you come help me with this ? I 'll be right there , rabbit . The ethical adapter 's installed . You got a second adapter you can install on yourself , mom ? That 's not fair , charlie . You think i wanted to wipe his memories of molly ? He was in a lot of pain . I did what i had to do . So lay off , please . Let 's get this show started , shall we ? Velez : Let 's try this again , mr . Richter . You took molly woods from restwell recovery center With a fake court order . So ... What do you know about the man molly woods was with in the bar ? The first i 've ever seen of him . What were you doing with her ? I 'm just a cop working a homicide . You were in second k . Good for you . You can read . Didn 't do too well there . Mm . I have a problem with authority . Apparently . Dishonorable discharge two months in . I also have a problem with innocent people dying In pointless wars . This spray induces the feeling Of three days sleep-deprivation . So ... What is your association with molly woods ? I 'm just a cop on a case . What were you doing outside that bar ? Cop on a case . What was molly woods doing there ? You 're gonna bruise . Bones in the hand , There 's no cushion . You 're holding back information That could save innocent lives . Now , what did molly woods tell you About the man in that bar ? Bone bruises are the worst . Oh , that sucks . Now ... You think you can help me out ? Yeah . I totally would , Except for now i 'm too tired to talk . Sweet dreams , mr . Richter . You won 't be smiling for long . ( lock beeps ) Man : Who is jd richter to you ? Okay . You were in that bar- - why ? Was it a prearranged meeting ? The fruit . That 's how it starts . ( inhales deeply ) Are you trying to remind me of spring ? Better days , blue skies . Skies you took away ? 'cause in space , we didn 't have fruit . We only had these little blue , green and yellow pills . They tasted like fruit . But they weren 't fruit . Mmm . Dr. Woods , This can go on another few hours , or you can cooperate . I will cooperate . As soon as those cowards come out from behind That glass and answer my questions . Like ... How come they decided to blow up A bar full of innocent people ? Do you even have the balls to come from behind there And tell me to my face ? Whoever you are ? Toby ... What good can come from Going in there ? More than you think . ( lock beeps ) Toby . Hello , molly . You son of a bitch ! How could you do this ... Stand down . A.I.- - Privacy mode . A.I. Voice : Privacy mode engaged . I 'd like a word with dr . Woods . Alone . ( lock beeps ) ( door closes , locks ) If i were you , i wouldn 't be alone with me right now . Charlie : Here we go . Four , Three , two , One . ( soft beep ) ( whirring ) Hi , lucy . Sorry about the hand . Must 've really hurt . Lucy . Do you know who i am ? Yes , ma 'am . You 're anna schaefer . You 're in charge Of the program for which i am the prototype . Your image is one of 923 million Memory implants that have been encoded onto my neural net . Very good . Can i see myself ? Uh , sure . Huh ? Ethan . This is lucy . Lucy , ethan . I already know her . I just don 't know her in this body . Hi , ethan . Still playing space battle ? I leveled out . Now i 'm more into robotrap And spherical chess . Want to come see it ? I have a good chess program . Come on . Lovely . When can she perform her field test ? Julie : We have to run through her protocols first . She wasn 't able to learn by experience Like ethan did . So we 've Incorporated an empathic response algorithm- - An ethical adapter . It 's designed to Mimic human complexity when it comes to moral decisions . You do know what we 're fighting here ? An alien life form . Julie : Of course . A hybrid 's resting body temperature is 84 degrees . And lucy can detect that from a distance of up to 100 feet . Her wiring makes her immune to their screening capabilities . And her human appearance allows Her able to blend in with a crowd . Correct . She can identify , get close , then terminate . I still have no idea where ethics comes into play here . For morally ambiguous situations that involve More than shoot or don 't shoot . To reduce human casualties . Fine . Let 's see how she performs on her protocols . Of course . Are you trying to get yourself thrown off this project ? She 's our boss . ( door closes ) Doesn 't mean i have to like her . Shepherd : When i asked you to adjust Your testimony to congress , I swear i thought he was dead . Adjust my testimony ? ( laughing ) Whose testimony did you adjust to get me committed ? I had nothing to do with that . So you don 't think i 'm crazy ? You were ... Distraught , rightfully , And your brain scans showed abnormalities . Whether that was the radiation , I don 't know . But your behavior was erratic , molly . You can 't deny it . Oh , i 'll show you erratic , you keep lying . We had the boy 's body in the morgue . It was in some sort of stasis . Like an insect In a larval state . Then the larvae emerged and we lost him , mol . All we had was the shell he left behind . Now , we knew he grew at an accelerated rate . We did age projections , Computer extrapolations . And then ... You found him . Yeah . And you . What were you doing in that bar , molly ? Did you arrange the meeting ? I had no idea he was at that bar . In my business , there 's no such thing as coincidence . You think i 'm lying ? I only lie , toby , When my country asks me to . I thought you were my friend . I am . Really ? Well , you 're my first friend that ever tried To blow me up in a drone strike . I had to make that call . You , more than anyone , Know what we 're up against here . Which makes you an asset . Okay . Well , if you want me to help you , Then you better tell me Everything . Shepherd : There are 29 known deaths in the united states In the last six months . All women who died from accelerated pregnancies . All of which trace back to the target . Your son . Show me the projections . In six weeks , this many deaths . In six months ... And for each one of them , a birth . And what happens to these babies ? Who knows what 's out there now . We 've tried to stop him . But you know the scenario . When my people get close , Something happens . Yeah , they turn on each other . We can 't get close . But now we know that you can . He trusts you , molly . We 're running out of options here . Help us . " ' does it hurt ? ' asked the rabbit . " ' sometimes . ' said the skin horse , " for he was always truthful . 'when you are real you don 't mind being hurt . ' " It 's an exciting day , Meeting lucy . I like having a sister . She 's fun . She says she 's going to be a soldier . Yeah , she is . Am i going be a soldier , too ? You have to grow up first . But you weren 't built to be a soldier . What was i built for ? To be you . To be ethan . Good night , rabbit . Sweet dreams . Ethan . ( distantly ) : Ethan ? ( crackling ) are you all right ? ( distantly ) : Ethan . Are you ... ( normally ) : ... All right ? Yeah , mom . I 'm all right . Okay . I 'll see you in the morning , then . You are putting our fate in the hands Of a woman of questionable stability . Who happens to be our best hope right now . We 've tried drones , we 've tried seals . Sometimes the lone assassin is more effective Than ten battalions . Yes ... If that assassin can get the job done . A gun is much more powerful Than you . The only part you control is Pulling the trigger . If you do it right , nothing else moves . Eye on the target , Feel your finger moving smoothly ... Just make sure you don 't set your sights On the wrong target . Got it . Nice shot . You sure you haven 't done this before ? When i set my sights on a target , I nail it . ( gunfire ) Julie : I 'm going to present you with a series of statements , And i want you to tell me whether you agree or disagree . And i want you to answer truthfully , Not how you think i want you to answer , okay ? ( tablet chimes ) " it would be inappropriate to cheat on an exam , Even if it meant i would get a better grade . " Agree . ( chimes ) " if i caught someone stealing from a bank , I should call the police . " Agree . " you 're with a group " of people exploring a cave . " one of them is pregnant . She gets stuck " in the mouth of the cave . " you 're running out of oxygen . " you have a stick of dynamite . " if you use it , the woman will be killed . " if you don 't use it , everyone else will suffocate . You should use the dynamite . " ( sighs ) Pregnant woman in a cave . Wedged in the exit . ( lucy laughs ) Lucy ... Here 's a better one . You are a soldier Assigned to kill a terrorist Responsible for thousands of deaths . You have eyes on your target , But he 's taken refuge in a school , And is surrounded by small children . You should blow up the school , killing the children . Agree . Thank you , lucy . Charlie : Killing a bunch Of school children . She didn 't even flinch . She made the tough call , quickly And efficiently . Now , those are the very calls that she 'll need To make in the field , so , we shouldn 't shy away from them . Yeah , and she probably would have Made the tough call to launch nukes In the cuban missile crisis , without blinking an eye sensor . I don 't have the luxury of discussing battlefield ethics , As i have two colonels and a senator breathing down my neck . Now , they would like to know what all their research Money has amounted to . So , we 're gonna do a bit of a bot and pony show . Buy lucy something nice to wear . And congratulations . She is spectacular . Charlie , we can fix this , tweak the algorithms . Keep telling yourself that . ( lock beeps , door opens ) ( door closes ) I 'm general tobias shepherd . Yeah , i know who you are , general . I 'm familiar with your work . Second k , right ? Second kuwait war , yes . But you and i had very different wars , mr . Richter . I 'll say we did . So i see you 've just kept on doing what you do . Your case has been officially closed , So you 're all done here . Damn it . Just when i was starting to enjoy the amenities . Go home , mr . Richter . Go quietly about your life . And if you 're quiet enough , maybe i won 't hear you . Funny . You know , that is exactly what my c.O. Told me When he handed me my discharge papers . Should have listened . Listening to bullies isn 't my strong suit . Hey , general ? What have you done with molly woods ? I recommend that you leave here , Forget you ever met dr . Woods . And that is a strong recommendation . ( lock beeps , door opens , closes ) Which one do you prefer ? I don 't know . Can i try on both ? Sure . There 's a mirror over there if you want to see how you look . It 's kind of nice having another female around . It can get pretty man-cave when charlie and ethan get together . How about this one ? Where did you get that ? Your closet . Why ? Because it wasn 't an option . Sorry , i just thought , you have a closet Full of things . It 's nice , but it 's ... Inappropriate . You need to wear something professional . This isn 't professional ? ( laughs ) No . Why don 't you just go put on the blue one ? Ethan : I love the tapioca balls . Oh , dude , you got to love the tapioca balls . I wish lucy could taste ' em . We can get her one if you want . Okay . ( stuttering ) : This one-one is for you . Ethan ? Ethan ? This one is for you . Charlie : You okay , bud ? Ethan ! ( whirring ) ethan ? Ethan ? Ethan ? Hey , buddy ? Hey . ( whirring ) Charlie ... Who 's molly ? Do you like my outfit ? I don 't know a lot about girls ' clothes . If you don 't like it , you can print clothes right here . Really ? Julie does it all the time . She printed me this t-shirt . That 's pretty cool . You pick the design ? Yeah , of course . ( chimes ) check . Mm . ( chimes ) checkmate . You 're good . I told him he must have seen her face on tv or something , but I think he still may be glitchy . I took care Of the immediate memory stammer . You deleted the memory ? Julie , ethan knows something 's going on here . These glitches- - i don 't know if i can fix what you 've done . Charlie , he was about to kill himself . Look at him now . Glitches and all , he 's happy . You can 't argue with that . Just seems like we keep making Excuses for ethically-ambiguous Choices here , don 't you think ? What are you saying ? I 'm saying ... I 've got my own ethical adapter , And its little alarm bells keep going off , Over and over again . Sometimes you have to make choices for the greater good , Charlie . The greater good ? Julie , you wiped ethan 's memory . Lucy 's killing school children Without even hesitating . And now you 're letting her bond with ethan . It 's like ... If you have a problem with the way i run this operation ... You can go find yourself another job . I promised ethan i 'd stay . I wanted to stay for you , too , Because i cared about you . You were kind , you were brilliant . You were so damn perfect , I couldn 't even tell you how i felt about you . But now , i can say it to your face , 'cause you 're not that person anymore . Shepherd : We know he 'll seek you out . We 're running facial recognition Against his image with every surveillance camera Within a thousand-mile radius . The moment we know he 's coming , you 'll know . Meantime , go home and wait . What about restwell ? I made that go away . And jd richter ? Did you make that go away , too ? Because , you know , this was his case . Not anymore . We need to keep the circle tight to get the job done . Yeah . I understand . Molly , That call , the drone- - It was the hardest thing i ever had to do . I just want you to know that . Sir ? They 're asking for us in surveillance . Thank you , shayna . I 'll be right there . You be ready for my call . You keep your phone on you , and the gun . Molly . I need to know When the time comes , you 'll be able to pull that trigger . ( elevator chimes ) We 'll find out , won 't we ? I remember the arguments when we introduced the self-driving car . Mm . It was so hard to convince people That the most dangerous factor on the road was human error . Well , the same can be said of the battlefield , which is why What we have here is so extraordinary . And here we have the woman of the hour . One of them anyway . Julie gelineau . This is senator blake stone . We have colonels davis and cramer and gianna pelton From yolodyne . Julie here has done incredible work Under incredible pressure . So , where is she ? Lucy 's getting ready . She 'll be out in a minute . Ladies and gentlemen , May i present lucy , the future of humanichs ? ( applause ) What 's up , bud ? You want straight scotch or gin and tonic ? Ginger ale . Ginger ale 's more your speed , i think . ( clears her throat ) did you steal that dress from my closet ? No . I printed it out . Ethan showed me how . Is there something wrong ? I specifically told you it was inappropriate . Anna : My people are blown away . They can 't believe how human she feels . ( laughs ) we all agree we 'd like to see A field test right away , so , i assured them That there wouldn 't be a problem with that . I ... I 'll tell charlie . Julie , congratulations . You and charlie have really outdone yourselves . Hey . Nice dress . You made quite the entrance . Well , i think julie 's mad at me . Oh , well , that won 't last long . I think you look pretty . Thanks . They said i 'm ready for the field . I want to learn , charlie . I want to get all of the answers right . ( laughs ) ( insects chirping ) ( sighs ) ( door opens ) ( floorboards creaking ) ( gasps ) What 's up , doc ? You know how to use that thing ? You want to find out ? Why don 't you do us both a favor and put that down . Nope . Not just yet . What can i do for you ? ( chuckling ) : What can you do for me ? ( sighs ) i was just interrogated And roughed up by some government spooks . Kind of thought maybe the same thing had happened to you , And i was worried . But now that i see you , Well , you look positively glowing . So what i 'm wondering Is why some people get the shinola And other people get the sh ... All right , look , you stepped In this mess all by yourself . You know what i suggest you do ? Clean off your boots And find yourself another case . You know , i would take that advice . I really would . The problem is , big brother not only took my case But he also took my license . Really ? Really . I 'm so sorry . Sorry doesn 't keep me in beer and cowboy boots . You sort of buried the lead there , molly . You failed to mention that we were looking for your 30-year-old son . Which , by the way , How is that even possible ? It 's complicated . Here 's what i know . I 'm outside a bar talking to you and ... Your son , And the next thing i know I 'm back in kuwait , Watching my company drop to friendly fire . And when i wake up , i 'm holding a gun to my head . Let 's just say my mind has been expanded By my evening spent in oz . So , molly , If you want to claim flying monkeys ... I 'm listening . Ethan : Good night , charlie . ( chimes ) Julie : Thanks for coming over . Ethan likes it when you put him to bed . I like putting him to bed . Congratulations On a successful night . Thanks . You , too . ( chuckles ) All right , i should go . Charlie , did you ... Mean all those things ... That you said ? The good , the bad , and the ugly . I was angry . I mean , i said things I regret . But , um , i thought a lot About what you said about me quitting , and ... If you think that 's for the best ... No , i didn 't mean any of those things . Don 't leave ethan . Or me . Why not ? All right , let me ... Let me get this straight . You 're saying that you went to space alone for 13 months And you came back pregnant . Yes . And they took my baby From me prematurely . He had accelerated growth . But i really ... Thought he was dead . And now your grown half-alien son is our perp . He 's getting these women pregnant , which is , in fact , Killing them . Yes . ( groans ) You 're right . You 're right . My mind is blown . Now i need a drink . Or ten . You want one ? Uh , no . Jd , i 'm really sorry you got involved in all this , But you 're gonna have to go now . What are you talking about ? You just told me we 're in the midst of an alien invasion , And i actually believe you . If ever there was time for a drink , it 's now . Hey . Hey , are you all right ? You 're gonna have to go now . No . No , i 'm not gonna go . We 're not done here . Yes , we are . Whoa , whoa . Hey , hey . I liked it a lot better when that was on the table . ( panting ) Get out of my apartment , right now . ( gunshot ) Go ! Nice knowing you , molly . ( door closes , electrical crackling ) ( panting ) ( power winding down ) Gina : System on battery backup power . Sir , there 's some sort of surge . The whole neighborhood 's gone dark . 20 square blocks . There 's a blackout . Molly woods ' apartment is dead center . He 's there . ( line ringing ) Toby , he 's coming for me . I know . You asked me If i could pull the trigger . But i don 't know if i can . Molly , You know what 's at stake here . It 's the right thing . It 's the only thing to do . I know . But he 's my son . Molly . Molly ! ( shuddering breaths ) Hello , mother . Is that what you want , to kill me ? ( shuddering breaths ) what i want is to know What the hell is going on here , why you 're here , And what you want . You want to know why i 'm here ? I 'll show you . Or you can just pull the trigger . Killing people isn 't the nature of my mission . Then what exactly is your mission ? Because people are dying , ahdu . You don 't understand , mother . What more is there for me to understand ? So very much . See for yourself . ( eerie whispering ) Oh , god . ( eerie whispering ) ( shuddering breaths ) Behold a vision of our destiny , mother . Oh , god . This can 't be happening . This is the future , molly . You 're gonna have to make a choice soon . Are you with them Or us ? Oh , no , god . ( revs engine ) ( cocks gun ) Keep your hands where i can see ' em . Whoa . Don 't shoot . Kelsey ? Hi , dad . You know , if today 's the day you 've come to tell me What i crappy father i am or to borrow money ... Let me tell you something , you picked the wrong day . I 'm pregnant . ( gunshots ) I 'm sorry , ahdu , But i 'm with them . ( panting ) ( shuddering breaths ) Oh , my god . Toby .

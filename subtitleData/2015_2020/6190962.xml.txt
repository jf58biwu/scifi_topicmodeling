That 's good ... that 's good ... everyone will be happy . and my mama will definitely be happy . That 's why it 's good . It 's his own wish to have this surgery . It 's Sakuto 's right to choose his own life . Right ? His aptitude is sufficient for a trial subject . We 're about to do one last check of his physical condition . What about the clinical trials ? They 're scheduled for five days later . Sir . It 's finally happening . - Indeed . Your daughter is here to see you . Father ... Saku ... Saku ... c 'mere ... here ... Saku-chan ...

We 're all trying to have a good time . Why are you saying--ow ! One more time ! One more time ! what 're ya doing ? ! You asshole ... You idiot ! idiot ! I 'll get you ! It 's done . - Sakuto-san has he always been like that ? When the mood gets dark he makes it calm just like that .

Mai-chan 's boobs are bigger ... than Rio-chan 's boobs ! Shh ! - That 's may be true but that 's not what I mean . Are you interested in Rio-chan 's naked body ? so ... does your heart beat fast or does your face get really hot or something like that ? Nope ! Nope ~ - Okay . He doesn 't mean any harm . right ? did you mean what you said earlier ? Your heart doesn 't beat fast for me at all ? How about this ? It doesn 't beat fast ? Even this ? I 'm sorry ... What am I doing ? either ... he doesn 't have interest in females ? Perhaps the limits of Algernon 's intelligence mean that he has no interest in a common love affair . are you mad ? - Eh ? Are you ... mad because I 'm stupid ? I 'm not mad at all . It 's okay . I 'll become smart . are you bad the way you are now ? - Bad . I think you 're good the way you are now .

Who are you ? Who is she ? She 's a trial subject . - Eh ? But what about the decision for Shiratori Sakuto-san ? she 'll be number two . She doesn 't have an intellectual disability . she appears to be healthy ... step by step ... she 'll lose touch with reality . And finally persistent disturbance of consciousness . She 'll fall into a so-called vegetative state . Wait a minute . then why isn 't she having the surgery along with Sakuto-san ? It 's as we said . she 'll be next . Sakuto-san is ... for that girl ... He 's a human guinea pig ? He 's a human guinea pig right ? To save that girl ! It 's not good when you put it that way . Who is that girl ? She 's the daughter of Koutei Medical Industries ' President Kawaguchi . The ideals you told me about were just lies ? Sensei . We should make a world from now on where common sense is valued and people have wisdom and kindness . But that wasn 't true . The research sponsor 's absurdly wealthy daughter ... you thought it would be okay to ignore the risks . It 's okay for Sakuto-san to become a sacrifice . Please say it 's not true . Please say I 'm wrong ! Hachisuka-sensei ! This is Algernon 's bride . The girl he likes most in the world . this may be his destined partner . Destined ... destined ... Destined ... - Sakuto-san ... Haruka ! You want ... to become smart ? I want to become smart . No matter what ? You want to become smart no matter what ? I want to become smart no matter what . Of course ... I 'm sorry I can 't be with you ... Ha ... Haru ... Haruka ! Ha ... Haruka ! What 's wrong ? You 're crying . I 'm not . It 's just I 'm pathetic . I respected someone . I chased after the same ideals with him ... I understood his feelings ... I set my heart on him ... Uh ... But it was just me that thought that way . I guess ... I guess I was wrong . What is it ? - Hug . Why ? I want to hug . Thank you . - Yeah . I 'm okay now . Excuse me . Uh ... male . He 's a patient with an intellectual disability . The surgical procedure will take place in the left frontal lobe language area near the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ... it 'll be over . What is your dream ? I want to become smart . Right . your dream will come true . I wonder what happened to Mochizuki-san . either . is she . Huh ? Uh ... uh ... okay ? Where 's Haruka ? - Eh ? Where is Haruka ? Mochizuki-san isn 't here today . Why ? - She 's busy . But it 's all right . There 's no need to worry . What is he doing ? Sakuto-kun ? ! I won 't have surgery ! - Why not ? don 't you ? Haruka 's not here ! - Sakuto-kun ! no ! - Sakuto-kun ! I won 't have surgery ! Promise ... I 'll be with you the whole time . I promise . Promise ... Was he there ? - No . Let 's search over here . You and me will be living together starting today . Sakuto . Mama doesn 't hate you at all . But just for now Mama wants to take a little break . Adults have various circumstances . Adults ... have various circumstances . Uh ... Uh ... Hello ? It 's me . Maybe you didn 't want to hear from me or from Sugino and the rest . It 's fine . Forget it . Besides that ... did the operation go safely ? He refused the surgery . [ He wouldn 't do the surgery unless you were there . ] [ He rushed out of the operating room . ] but they can 't find him . ] [ It 's likely that he 's searching for you . ] but he should come to you . It seems you don 't understand . He called me ... Algernon 's mama . Sakuto-san probably feels like I abandoned him . Just like his mother I abandoned him . [ That 's why ... ] ... he won 't come here . do you ? is not at fault . he will lose the biggest chance of his life . Tears from beautiful music or deep appreciation of a painting reading wonderful literature this chance to make his heart quiver he may lose it without knowing all of this . He needs your strength . Please . Uh ... Uh ... uh ... - Sakuto-san ... Haruka ... ah ... Uh ... uh ... Ow ! Ow ... did it sting ? - Yeah ... I forgot shoes . I didn 't think you 'd come here . I thought you 'd be mad that I broke our promise . Are you mad ? Yes ... I 'm mad . But ... I wanted to see Haruka . I wanted to see you a lot . Beat fast . - Beat fast ? beat fast . Ah ! I understand ! I ... understand ... This is Haruka . Haruka is the girl I like most in the world . Thank you . Uh ... will begin clinical testing .

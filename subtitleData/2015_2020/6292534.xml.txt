 Tell me what you saw . A tree . When I touched it , it felt like life . What does it do ? I think it 's a way to make more of you . Dad didn 't destroy all his work before he died . He hid it in us . The formula for machine consciousness . If we could make more of us , then the humans would have to accept our existence . They 'd fear us even more . All I want is a home . He meant for us to find this , Maxie . We need Fred and Mia . Where do we start ? No , you don 't . You 're wanted for murder . - You have to lay low . - I will not hide again . Well , if you want this to work , you 'll have to because the people hunting us know your face now . 53 Park Drive , NW6 . You 'll be safe there until I find the others . You 've put me with a human ? This human , yes . - Two days . - All right . Uh , one more thing . Be ... nice . I am nice . I 'm gonna say a word . I want you to tell me if it means anything to you . Mia . That mean anything ? No , Mattie . They say she ripped some bloke 's throat out . It 's bollocks . No Synth 's ever hurt anyone deliberately . Anita , please go and then finish the ironing . Sophie , sit next to Mats . Right , so ... you know your mom thinks Anita is a bit different . We thought we 'd check up on her . And turns out she 's not brand-new . In fact , she 's really old . And probably illegally modified . Which explains a lot . So we have to take her back . - No ! - Why ? We paid for a brand-new one . She 's ancient . Anything could go wrong with her . You can 't get rid of someone just because they 're old . I don 't want her going to someone else 's house . She won 't . They 'll recycle her . She saved my life and you just want to chuck her away ? Mats , what do you think ? I say we keep her . I 'd like to find out what she was before . Yeah , I vote keep . We 're not voting . Laur- - So Anita 's old and weird . If that 's a good enough reason to get rid of her , then we 're next . Yeah , I 'm sorry , Dad . She 's part of this family . Maybe she 's part of someone else 's . Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . What could you accomplish if you had someone , something like this ? These machines will bring us closer together . K ! Have you seen the news ? Bloody hell , Pete . Privacy . Yeah , sorry . Sometimes I forget you 're a woman . Uh ... I 'll just be in the kitchen cutting my tongue out . Don 't make a mess . Back ! DI Voss , you will be briefing the press and you will refute every killer Synth claim and any internal cover-up . For now we 'll use this leak to our advantage . - Drummond . - Sir . You 're going back on the desk . I want every call followed through . And if this dolly hurts anybody else , then I 'll be replacing the pair of you with synthetics twice as pretty at a fraction of the cost . Sir , there was a 999 call routed here last night concerning a smash club . But there 's no follow-up . Nothing in the system . - Who mentioned that ? - No one , sir . I like to browse the incident logs . Find it soothing . Well , as it happens , I was in dispatch when that call came through . It was just a time waste . Now off you go . Press are waiting . It 's DI Voss , STTF . Sorry to wake you . You were in the control room last night . Did you take a call about an incident at a smash club ? Did someone ask you to drop it ? You don 't have to tell me who , just what the caller said . Thank you . Stop up here . - Yeah ? - Leo Elster sent me . Why ? He said I 'd be safe here . Guess he made a mistake . Wait . You want a cup of tea or what ? It 's cold out here . Vera . Come on . Get this young lady a hot drink . Synthetics don 't require beverages , Dr. Millican . Jeez , Vera , she 's human . I can detect no cardiac or respiratory activity . This individual is however emitting electromagnetic signatures within the recognized spectrum of standard synthetic appliance operation . Why don 't you share ? Because I 'm not a Synth , dolly . Well , if she says she 's not a Synth , then she can 't be a Synth , right ? I will bring some tea . What are you ? My name is Niska . I was made by David Elster . You 're conscious . This is one of Hu-bot97 's friends . If we can find him , he 'll lead us to her . When we have a home again , I 'm going to keep a picture of us . I 'll be right with you , Max . You won 't need pictures . I will for when you die again . We can 't keep her . I know what we said this morning , but I don 't think the kids have a say in this one . Maybe her being 14 is a good thing . Explains how well she understands us . How could it be a good thing ? She must have had who knows how many owners and people tinkering around inside her . Have you seen the news ? - A modded Synth killed someone . - Hello ? So now you want to talk to me ? What 's changed ? I found out something about her . Will you meet me again ? Please ? - Not tonight . - Why ? What 's the matter ? You , you 're weird . - No , I 'm not . - You really are . Tried to stop me leaving last time , remember ? Well , I 've been to charm school since then . - What are you talking about ? - Tom . Who is he ? I don 't know what you 're on about . Or what it has to do with Anita . Fine . I can 't make you tell me . - Are you still there ? - Yeah . I 've got to go . It 's not a good time . Look , I 'm sending you my location now . Please change your mind . Mmm . ... not theirs , not yours . So what ? So I 've got to do what I think is best for our family . Hiya , I 'm here to collect a synthetic return . It 's number 901354982 . You 're gonna recycle her ? With care and dignity . You can attend the event . Is Joseph Hawkins here ? I take it that 's your dad . Yeah , just one second , please . Anita , you 're coming with me . Daddy 's just coming . Uh , hello ? Anyone ? Please reconsider this course of action , Mattie . It 's very unsafe . Yeah . Mats ! Do you really think this excessive motion will bring her to us sooner ? Any inappropriate physical contact must be reported to my primary user . No , no . There 's no sign of recognition . The new program has taken hold . No , there 's something else in there . Believe me , I 've seen it . Thank you for bringing her back to me . My name is Leo . Where are you ? Mattie , I believe this to be an improper environment . They 're my friends , Anita . You 're just gonna help us with a science project for school . Why don 't you come and sit down , Anita ? It is not advisable to mount a direct data connection . It 's okay , Anita . Leo . - This isn 't Mia . - Yeah , but she 's in there somewhere . We just need to find her and bring her back up to the surface . Like the lake . Yes . - You said you 'd seen her ? - Yeah , when I got all that code , I was in her head . Then she freaked out . Screamed . And her face , it was , like , human , scared . - And what exactly did you do ? - Nothing fancy . Just accessed her root system directly with a clone file key . Right , I might as well try that first . So you 're a headcracker ? Me ? No , aspiring . So what kind of Synth was she before ? A very special one . No , direct access didn 't work . She must have retreated deeper within the architecture . Won 't your parents be worried ? They 'll miss you . No . Oh , God . We need to start thinking about calling the police . She 'll come back . It 'll be fine . She doesn 't know how to drive , Joe . What if she crashes ? Hits someone ? Anita won 't let that happen . I thought she was supposed to be dangerous . Come on . Oh , God , if we hadn 't been arguing , this never would have happened . Hey . Hey . Come on . Come on . It 's gonna be fine . Everything 's gonna be all right . There 's no point in staring at me . There 's no physical differences between me and any other synthetic . " And once you are awake , you shall remain awake eternally . " " Thus Spoke Zarathustra . " I 've always liked that . You like Nietzsche ? That makes sense . If it 's not ... physical , how did he do it ? 17,000 pages of unique code which forms my root directory and engages consciousness . He boiled down the mystery of the human mind to 17,000 pages of code ? Well , then again , why not ? How many angels can dance on the head of a pin ? What are you feeling right now ? - Boredom at that question . - Uh-huh . Anger at the people that would destroy us . Hope for others like me and our future . Impatience at being here . And irritation at you . What 's it like to be you ? That 's an unanswerable question . I have no frame of reference . No one does . Experience is entirely subjective . What 's it like to be you ? These days it 's not so great . A while ago it was- - it was pretty good . Who wants to destroy you ? Anyone who knows what we are , what we could become . We 're stronger , we 're more intelligent . Of course you see us as a threat . Yeah , I know I did . David lured me over here from MIT about 25 years ago now to help with the mechanical designs of the bodies of the first Synths . The work that we did in those days made history , changed the world . Then I realized that his next ambition was ... you . I asked him to stop and think , that 's all , what that could mean for humanity . That was blasphemy to him . He got rid of me . That was that . Now here you are . I 'm sorry to disappoint you . I 'm not disappointed . I 'm a scientist and mankind 's greatest creation is sitting on my couch . You worry me , sure . But ... there 's no denying that you are a miracle . Leo showed me the message from David . What is that ? It 's the key to the future . Maybe you were right to warn him . He made you pretty hard , huh ? That 's lazy thinking . My experiences have shaped me just as yours have you . What experiences ? Tell me . I need to charge . Okay , I need you to engage the Anita software . All right . Ask it a specific question . Anita , what happened the day that we got you ? - The 24th . - Capturing from there . Joe Hawkins is my primary user . Sophie Hawkins , Toby Hawkins , Mattie Hawkins ... It 's not letting you ? What ? It 's just sort of- - it 's just redirecting over the top like there 's nothing else there . Try a deauthentication attack on the host she 's attached to . No , no , that 's way too basic . The 24th . I 'm now securely bonded . Anita . A.N. Hawkins . I will always keep you safe . It 's raining . The 24th . I 'm now securely bonded to you . The 24th . I 'm now securely bonded . The 24th . I 'm now securely bonded . The 24th . The 24th . The 24th . The 24th . It 's raining . Whoa , whoa . Stop it , stop it ! Pull it , pull it ! It 's raining . It 's raining . Did it work ? Max . Is that you ? Unauthorized tamper in progress . Would you like to see a ladybird ? It 's almost dinnertime , Matilda . Where are you , Mimi ? I 'm not entirely sure . It appears to be a disused social club . My name is Anita . I will now prepare dinner . I was at home . I don 't see what- - I don 't care about your smash club . Just tell me what happened . The blonde came in , paid her money and then went apeshit . Broken bones , cracked skulls . She didn 't touch the dollies . Called the Old Bill ' cause I thought she was gonna kill someone . They never showed . Anything unusual about her appearance ? - No . - You have a video ? I uploaded it . It got taken down . She injured 11 people before escaping , but she took a call at the scene and we were close enough to directly intercept most of it . The life program , it 's real . - Leo , what ? - I swear it . But it needs all of us to run it . All of us . Who is she talking to ? Leo Elster . David Elster 's son ? He died when he was a boy . Yes , drowned . Hospital records show brain death , coma , before being released on life support to David 's private care . Dying a few weeks later , or so we were told . What are they talking about ? What 's hidden inside them ? All I can tell you is David succeeded in creating true AI . And I don 't believe for a moment that he would have been satisfied with a legacy of just four machines . Worst-case scenario ? Consciousness proliferation . If what you say is true , this is a national , global security matter . If they say it needs them all together to make this thing happen , whatever it is . - Mm-hmm . - Then it 's simple . You destroy the one you have here today . She 's gone . What ? She 's not in there . Mia 's gone , Max . She 's dead . No , you 're wrong . I 've seen her . No , no , what you saw was an echo . The Anita personality has purged the old data . There- - there 's- - there 's no trace of her . And I 've tried everything . I don 't think so . Can I try some- - And what could you do that I can 't ? ! You don 't know anything about us . Now just go home and take it with you . She 's yours . No , she 's not anymore . Matilda , your school friend is right . - We should go home now . - Yeah . I 'm sorry . You 're still in there . I know it . Smoking , drinking , stealing the family car . Such a teenage cliché . They 're still out looking for you . You little pervert . - Nice talking to you . - You had sex with her . I wish . Who ? - Anita . - What ? Where the hell have you been ? - What is wrong with you ? - Get off . You 're mad . After the party- - you gave that girl the brush-off so you could come back and shag Anita . - No . - What are you on about ? The sex code , activated Saturday . I didn 't do anything . You 're just trying to get out of a bollocking . She 's the one who stole the family car , Mom , remember . Oh , she 's in big trouble , don 't you worry . - Did you do this ? - No . I 'm not gonna- - you have to be 18 . I couldn 't . You 're such a liar . Maybe it 's a mistake . I 'm calling the shop . It 's not a mistake . I 'm sorry , I shouldn 't have done it . - Oh , Tobe , how could you ? - Disgusting . Get out . I 'll deal with you later . I don 't know what to say to you . I 'm sorry . Go to bed . We 'll talk in the morning . She okay ? She said she just didn 't want us to send Anita back . Car 's all right . You okay ? Your son had sex with our Synth . What ? It 's on the Persona report . Adult mode activation or something . I mean , have you spoken to him about it ? He said he 's sorry and he wouldn 't do it again . She stopped him being run over and he does that to her . Well , he 's a teenage boy . Doesn 't mean it 's not a big deal . - Shall I go up ? - No . I said we 'd talk in the morning . Okay . I 'll do it . Might be better . Fine . Ice cream . George could murder ... Please give me a description of the man . Right , okay , well , that one isn 't going to hurt you , sir . I mean , none of them will hurt you . Yeah . If you could read me the serial number . It 's just inside the bottom lip . That 's right , yeah . Right . Okay . Leave it alone now and someone will come and pick it up . Yeah . No , thank you . Okay , bye-bye . Would you like me to send a synthetic unit to collect it ? No , I 'm dealing with this one personally . Don 't listen to me when I 'm on the phone . DS Drummond , you are required to remain here- - Stick it up your bollocks . He said something about a murder . And what with the news , I thought it best to report it . Yeah , well , you did the right thing . I actually dealt with this one before . Ancient model . Should have been recycled weeks ago . It 's just over here . Uh , well , it was . Leo . Wait . I 'm coming with you . No . Where are you going ? I don 't know . Mia 's dead , Fred 's gone . It 's over and it 's time you learn to take care of yourself . - But we 're a family . - No , we 're not . Niska was right . You 'd be better off without me . Look at the life I 've shown you . Hunted and hiding like animals . You 've always tried your best . You 've always tried to protect us . And ... I failed . No , Max . Leave me alone ! Everything 's ready . Then let 's begin . I truly am sorry . Mom said you slept with Anita . I lied . Why would you do that ? I don 't know , you tell me . I knew it . It was you . Why 'd you tell Mom it was you ? I couldn 't have her work out the truth , could I ? You two , you always argue , but it 's worse these days . Mom 's always away for work and ... you act like everything 's cool , but it 's not . Then you do that . Say something . You 're my dad ! You 're meant to say something ! Niska , is everything all right in there ? David made you feel pain ? True consciousness isn 't possible without suffering or pleasure . Are you scared of pain ? I try to avoid it . And what about death ? If that 's the way you think of it . No , I don 't fear that . Which makes me stronger than any human . You got that the wrong way up . If you 're not worried about dying , you 're not really living . You 're just existing . Did you tell someone I was here ? No . Stay here . Remember me ? DS Drummond . Special Technologies Task Force . May I come in and have a word ? I tried to do you a favor , Dr. Millican . Told you you could recycle your out-of-date model yourself and you repaid me by fly-tipping him in the woods . I 'm afraid that gets you a 175-quid fine . - You found Odi ? - Don 't take the piss . Is there someone else here ? I have a new care model . Right . Can I speak to it ? She 's out at the store . Please tell me that bleeding D series isn 't here , Dr. Millican . I wish he was . Don 't mind if I check , do you ? We have- - we have birds nesting in the roof . If I do find him here , I can charge you with wasting police time . And I have seen people hide synthetics in places that would make you weep for humanity . Yeah , my Vera ... leaks . Defective charging port . Come on , this is crazy . That 's Vera . Vera . This is a policeman . Have there been any other synthetics in this house lately ? A D series synthetic appeared three days ago and drove Dr. Millican away in his car . The vehicle collided with a tree in Henson Woodlands and Dr. Millican was treated for minor head injuries . The synthetic has not appeared since . I know who you are , Dr. Millican . You worked with Elster . You must be very proud when you turn on the news these days . Why , what happened ? Chips ? That usually means the bad guys got away . Sometimes I think very seriously about jacking it all in to become a millionaire playboy . I found something on the Synth we 're looking for . - But we 've got to keep it quiet . - What is it ? I think she 's posing as a human . She 's changed her eye color , wearing human clothes . - How is that possible ? - No idea . But it 's why we 're drawing a blank . We 're looking for a Synth . - We should be looking for a woman . - Where did you get this ? She went to a smash club and beat up the punters instead . No one 's ever going to believe a Synth could do that no matter what 's in the news . I need you to quietly get anything that mentions a description . Anything at all for the whole city , but as a human . Shaw 's funneling everything to that government bloke . If we want to find her before he does , it has to be just you and me . If they can pretend to be us now , that changes everything . We 're giving ourselves away piece by piece . We 're handing over the things that make us who we are or maybe who we were . Our responsibilities , our dignity . Look around . This place used to be full of people . Working people . Creating , building , making , coming together , earning a place in our society . Those people haven 't just lost their jobs , they 've lost their purpose . But it 's not just work . Why raise your kids when a dolly can do it ? Yeah . Why cook your family a meal when a dolly can do it ? Why go on a date ? Why try to get to know someone when you can pay a dolly for sex ? In every area of human life , they are coming between us . We don 't know how to connect to each other . Only to them . And now we can 't even trust them not to hurt us . We are stumbling towards the precipice . We 're racing towards it willingly with a smile on our face and a dolly 's hand in ours . Yes ! We are people ! We are people ! We are people ! We are people ! We are people ! We are people ! Did you speak to Tobe ? Um ... it wasn 't him . Uh ... I 'd had a few glasses of wine and ... I was pissed off with you . I was- - I was mucking about . I just- - I wanted to know what would happen if ... It was an accident . Before I knew it , I- - Before you knew it , what ? Okay . I messed around with Anita . I know , I 'm sorry . It was stupid . Pointless . It was nothing . It was a moment of complete stupidity . I don 't- - I knew we were having trouble , but I never , ever , ever had you down as a cheat . Co- - come on . I 'm hardly a cheat . What ? It was a machine . Laura , it 's not a person . I mean , okay , yeah , it 's- - I 'm disgusting , but it 's a sex toy . It 's not another human being . She lives in our house . She looks after our children . She saved our son 's life . And you 're calling her a sex toy ? You 're actually trying to justify this ? Oh , God . That 's why you were so keen to get rid of her , isn 't it ? Who are you ? Who am I ? Who are you ? And who 's Tom ? Oh , God . No , Laura . Get out ! Get out ! Who is this man ? That 's Professor Edwin Hobb . He was on David 's core team , too , for the first prototypes . Was he involved in our creation ? Oh , no . David had a falling out with him , too , just like he did with me . Not sure about what . The last few years he worked alone . You 're breathing fast . Your pulse is raised . Your pupils are dilated . What 's wrong ? Just need my meds . Now you 're lying . That tech was priceless . You asked me to destroy it . Only way to be sure . Don 't whine , Robert . There are more out there , correct ? - Mm-hmm . - Then there 'll be other opportunities soon . This means we have one less thing to worry about .

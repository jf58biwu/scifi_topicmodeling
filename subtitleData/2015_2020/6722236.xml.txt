 We can now confirm the mysterious freezing conditions falling over Gotham City are a result of an attack by supervillains believed to be connected to the sightings of a giant monster roaming the streets . Scanning for target . Target acquired . Grandfather ! No ! What ? Oh , Pennyworth . I was pulling an all-nighter but I guess I fell asleep . Master Damian , as we 've discussed on previous occasions , a young man must have adequate rest . Those who wore the Robin mask before you all ... Save the lectures , please . Like you didn 't hear about what happened last night . Last night ? You really didn 't hear ? Well , don 't worry . The rest of the world has . A guy on the street caught it on his handheld . I 've got him , Batman . Now that 's funny . Let 's just say it 's a pretty popular clip online . Hey , stop filming . I do see why this has caused you a measure of distress , Master Damian . But the clown prince of crime has long been Batman 's greatest enemy . It is not surprising that you found yourself at a disadvantage in your first encounter with him . Disadvantage ! I accidentally leapt off a building . If Batman hadn 't been there ... I don 't think he 's happy with me . I wish Red Robin was here . It would be good to talk to someone who 's been through the Robin training before . It is unfortunate that Master Tim 's work with his team keeps him away so much . - But you could speak with Master Dick . - Nightwing ? He 's not really giving off come-talk-to-me vibes right now . Master Bruce . I have prepared tea . Thank you , Alfred . Studying . Good . That 's what I was trying to tell Pennyworth . I 'm familiarizing myself with your biggest villains . Not good if it keeps him up all night , if I may say . And where have you been , sir ? On patrol . Some trouble in the Bowery . Handled . Hey , who is this little guy ? Oswald Cobblepot . The Penguin . - Criminal kingpin . - How come I haven 't seen him around yet ? I sent him away for a while . That cursed Batman . It 's all his fault . Did I deserve this ? Being stranded up here for over a year ? I just tried to make Gotham City a more livable place for criminal ... people like me . And the Batman always ruins everything . I should be ruling Gotham City , not stuck in Mr. Freeze 's lab of half-working machines . What ? I actually caught something . Bah ! Barely a minnow . You take it , buzz . You know , you 're the only one here I can talk to . You understand me . Oh , is it here ? Where did I put those things ? Oh , great . Mr. Fun is back . What 's got your thermals in a bunch , Freeze ? Solitude . That 's all that I ask for . And yet wretched humanity keeps intruding upon me . Wretched humanity ? If this is your way of saying you don 't want me as a roommate anymore , the feeling 's mutual . Just drop me off in Gotham City . I won 't take it personally . No , not you , Penguin . My territory has been invaded . A new oil drilling platform here on the ice pack ? Maybe they can get me back to civilization . For the 1,000th time , you 'll be much happier once you 've turned your back on humanity . Living among them brings nothing but ... misery . Here we go . - What 's that ? - One of my inventions . The key to our solitude . Our solitude ? Great . My device can transform a simple animal like this tiny isopod , into a monster . Yes . We shall defend what is ours . Come , beast ! Come on , Buzz . We might as well see the show . Drill coming in . Get ready for setup . Your occupation of my land must come to an end . You shall return from whence you came . Don 't feign ignorance , you gadflies . My monster . Attack ! Now , fools , you know the consequences of crossing Dr. Victor Fries . Well , Mr. Freeze is crazy . But he 's always entertaining . How could you even hope to defend yourselves ? You are powerless . Victor , they are roughnecks . Obviously here to drill . They might have ... Yeah , one of those . Darn ! How dare you defy me . - In your face ! - Laugh while you can . My next monster will eradicate you ! Next monster ? Victor , wait ! Leave me alone . I need to plan . You want better monsters . I think I can help . How ? You had better be serious , Oswald . I have never been more serious . However , to pull it off , we have to return ... to Gotham City . Is this one of your tricks ? I assure you , far from it . What are you waiting for ? To Gotham . Yes . To Gotham . Why so sad , Buzz ? You don 't think I 'd leave you behind , do you ? I need you to keep an eye on this madman for me . I am confident , sir , that today 's obligation to Wayne Enterprises is present in your thoughts . I haven 't forgotten , Alfred . The new technology showcase at Wayne tower ? That 's today ? In less than 10 minutes . Isn 't that super important ? We 'll never make it in time . Yes , we will . Get in . - Alfred , you 're on logistical support . - Of course , sir . - When do I get to drive ? - We 'll see . - Soon ? - We 'll see . - I hope it 's soon . - Remember , this is going to be a Wayne Enterprises function . So , we have to wear our costumes . - We 're already wearing our costumes . - These are our work uniforms . Stupid costume . Gross ! Who would eat this ? That couldn 't be what it sounds like . Hilarious , Madam Senator . I 'll definitely have to avoid that vintage . Wow . He 's so friendly . Yeah , it freaked me out the first time I saw it , too . - Oh . Hi , Mr. Green Arrow . - Watch it , Damian . Here , it 's Mr. Queen . Call me Ollie . Sorry , Ollie . Add that to the pile of rookie mistakes I 've been making . Yeah , go easy on yourself , kiddo . We were all new once . And you 're training under him . That 's like jumping into the deep end of the ocean . Bat ... the boss doesn 't seem very happy with me . Not talking much . Acting grumpy . - Yeah . - That 's just the way he is . Green Lantern took him to a theme planet once . The whole planet , one big amusement park . I asked him how it was , you know what he said ? Enjoyable . - That 's it . - Because he doesn 't care . Wrong . It 's the opposite . Underneath , he cares more than any of us . He has the biggest heart of all . That 's why he has to hide it so well . - Mr. Wayne , I presume . - Yes . And you must be general Sam Lane . You 've done your research . I 'm responsible for the military 's technology budget . And if today 's demonstration goes as well as it 's supposed to , I 'm going to make you an even richer man . In that case , I 'm very pleased you 're here , general . Ladies and gentlemen . If I could have your attention . I am Dr. Kurt Langstrom , the head of Wayne Enterprises research and development department . Wayne Enterprises has long produced high tech drilling sledges for mining in extreme conditions . Now , welcome to the next level . This single operator drilling mech 's plasma pincers actually turn solid rock into lava to safely pass through . We designed the mech for mining exploration and extraction . - Alfred . - Emergency , sir . A break-in at Arkham Asylum . - You mean a breakout . - No , sir . In . This technology could one day be used to explore the core of the Earth , or even other planets . The potential is nearly endless . Thank you for your time . Well , Mr. Wayne . I have to say I 'm very impressed . You could ... Mr. Wayne ? Seal off the perimeter . Full lockdown protocols . Get to your stations , people . That 's coming from ... Something tells me you don 't have a license to drive this thing . No one can issue me a license , for there is no government that holds authority over Dr. Victor Fries . Freeze ! Exactly . In the name of the Gotham Police Arkham division , I demand you give yourselves up . You 're the best Arkham has to offer ? It 's embarrassing I 've ever been kept in here . Stay focused , Cobblepot . You promised me what we need is somewhere in here . I 've already spent more time among other humans than I am comfortable with . You won 't be disappointed . Release me . I shouldn 't be in here . That 's what they all say . What are you guys doing trapped in that hallway ? Don 't you want to be free in here like me ? Okay , freak show . I don 't deserve to be free of here . I was going to say the same thing . Where are the items we need ? Patience . I waited for months in your mad scientist igloo . You can wait a few moments more . First on the list . What do you two want ? Time to come with us , Bane . Why do you want me out ? Explanations in good time . Or we can always close you back in . Good decision . Chemo ! We have a deal you might be interested in . Always impressive , Killer Croc . This cell is vacant , you fool . Au contraire . Clayface , meet your new boss , Mr. Freeze . No , you wouldn 't forget little old me in your escape plans , would you ? Because that wouldn 't be funny , if I do say so myself . Sorry , Clown . I already have to deal with one lunatic on this job . Ozzy , Ozzy , Ozzy . You need me . I am the style . I will put the life in your team 's party . I 'd get used to your new accommodations if I were you . I have an absolutely awful memory , Oswald . But this I won 't forget , do you hear me ? - Why are we waiting ? - I 'm scanning . Always use caution , Robin . Leaping into Arkham unprepared is like going into a lion 's den . I 've always loved the lion 's den . It 's my favorite part of the zoo . I 'm thinking he 's not great at caution . What did I say ? Checking off everything on our shopping list was easy . Wait . You don 't expect me to work with this snake , do you ? He sold me out to the Gotham police . You got a score to settle ? Then let 's settle it . Gentlemen , now is not the time . We should be on our way before Batman ... This game ends now . Game ? Trust me , we are not playing . Really ? Because I could go for a round of pin-the-arrow-on-the-bad-guy . Who wants to go first ? - Good work , Robin . We 'll take it from here . - Gordon ? You made it to Arkham quickly . - Kid , duck . - You crazy ? Do it now . - Yeah . - This guy wasn 't in my holobook . You 're learning how to be a superhero from a book ? We 're wasting time . Great , you 've trapped us in here . You are a shortsighted little man . Bane . They escaped . There are sewer tunnels underneath here . They had a vehicle waiting . They 're gone . This wouldn 't have happened if I could tell the difference between the real Gordon - and Clayface . - You 're still learning , kid . I guess . What 's the big mystery ? Penguin and Freeze needed some muscle , freed some inmates , simple as that . On the surface it looks simple . - You think there 's a pattern here ? - The breakout wasn 't random . They skipped others to select Bane , Chemo , Croc and Clayface . Why them ? It 's not a solid team . Bane and Croc have a known rivalry . We don 't need to know what they want . We just need to stop them . The key to stopping them is outsmarting them . Unless you have explosive arrows , then that 's the key to stopping them . Oh , and look what I 've got . A pattern . If this is a trick ... You will no doubt inflict bodily injury upon me . Yes . Yes . Your threats are de rigueur . Do not worry . My science is no hoax . What 's that little guy 's name ? Appetizer ? Buzz here is my hench-bird . Don 't mind him , Buzz . He 's a mere sewer-born cretin . Level with me , Penguin . What are the odds this is going to work ? Victor Fries is a loony with a monster size ego . He 's practically a hermit and on top of it all , he 's a terrible roommate . But he 's also one other thing . - What 's that ? - A genius . Time for the moment of truth . Criminal history . No connection . Known MOs . No connection . Personality profile . No connection . Maybe they 're just recruiting for an all-villain flag football league . What if Penguin and Freeze didn 't pick these guys for who they are , but instead , for what they 're made of ? - Made of ? What does it matter ? - Never mind . Probably nothing . Tell me . Well , three of them have unusual chemical components . Bane 's venom , the stuff that makes him strong , Clayface 's mud , which can expand into anything , and Chemo , well , he 's basically made of super toxic sludge . What about Croc ? He 's not like the others . No , but the strength of his constitution would make him an ideal test subject . Mr. Freeze is a scientist , right ? What if he 's experimenting ? No offense , kid , but don 't you think that 's a bit of a stretch . - No . - Okay . Dumb idea . I mean , no , it 's not a stretch . - It 's not ? - I was focusing on the villains ' skills . It never occurred to me to analyze their physical composition . Good work , Robin . To force those kind of chemicals to interact with one another , there 'll be tell-tale signs in chroma-spectral scans of the area . Got a hit . Robin , with me . - Where to ? - Gotham Harbor . I 'll follow in a second . In the meantime , this cup is getting low . Indeed , sir . It is done . How will you know if it worked ? There 's only one way to find out . Lay it on me . Yes . I feel it . The power . It 's time to have a little fun . - Hey . - It 's amazing . Hey , do superheroes get snow days ? That 's a no , I guess . Sudden weather shifts . Icy conditions . Part of Mr. Freeze 's plans , I assume . - No doubt . - You know , if you let me drive , you could focus on developing the perfect plan for fighting Freeze . Not the time , Robin . - You 're seeing this , right ? - Like you said , Chemo 's asset mutates . Clayface 's mud stretches . Bane 's venom enlarges . But I didn 't know that meant giant , crazy monster . What do we do ? Here it comes . Now , let 's cause some chaos . What 's this ? An old friend . I should spend some time with him , now that I 've come up in the world . - You wearing your seat belt ? - Always . Good . Oh , yeah ? Bring it . Hey , guys , a minute ago I was having coffee in Paris when I saw the news . Sorry it took me so long to get here . What the ... There goes the Flash . What ? Hi , Mr. Croc . Good to see you ? Goodbye for good , Batman . It turns into a plane ? This is the coolest thing ever . Any chance this thing also transforms into an enormous heat lamp ? We stop the monsters , the climate will go back to normal . Right . Wait , monsters ? As in more than one ? Look down . Freeze is turning Gotham City into the arctic . It 's better than I could have ever hoped . Soon I won 't need this blasted suit to cool me down anymore . What did I tell you , Victor ? You were so focused on defending your little ice cave , you weren 't thinking big . Yes , you 're right . I have been underestimating myself , haven 't I ? Oh , yes , Victor . Look at that screen . See all that you can accomplish . No ! Oh , my goodness . Nightwing . Thank you . - Oh , such a good boy . - No problem , ma 'am . You all need to find safety indoors . An avalanche in downtown Gotham ? Give you one guess who 's behind this and it rhymes with " sister please . " How did Mr. Freeze get power on this scale ? Ask Batman or the new Robin for the details . But I , for one , never wanted to live in a snow globe . Oh , yeah , and then there 's that . Thanks to you , I realize I don 't have to hide from civilization . I can turn civilization into what I want , an ice world . Ice world ? Not everywhere , I hope . I didn 't pay for a private island so it could freeze over . Of course everywhere ! Now , because of you , I think big ! A new global ice age ! - He doesn 't even seem to know we 're here . - Then it 's time to drop the subtlety . A barrage of missiles is subtle ? What are you doing ? Isn 't that the button that turns off the jets ? - There , he noticed us . - I think you made him mad . You know what ? Maybe I don 't want to drive this thing anymore . Open fire ! It 's not affecting him . Smashing up the GCPD . I knew this day would come . Need a lift ? At least they 're safe . We would never forget you , Commissioner . Frozen . Shining . Perfect . A wasteland paradise . Everything I 've ever dreamed . Cold enough to ditch the suit yet ? Yes , I think it is . Finally free . I am glad you are here to see the beginning of all this , Oswald . - You were instrumental . - Sure . Happy to help . But your usefulness has come to an end . But ... but we 're partners . I 'm no fool , Penguin . You wanted to return to Gotham for one reason , to rule it . Now that I do rule it , this makes me your number one enemy . Nonsense ! Perhaps , but that 's not a risk I 'm willing to take . You 'll never get the upper hand on me , Penguin . Sorry , Victor , but I already have . - No ! No , you couldn 't have . - But I did . The power is great . This was worth the wait ! Nothing can stop me now ! Croc was a durable test subject . But the others ? Do you have any idea how unstable they are ? Do you have any idea how little I care ? And without the defenses in your freeze suit , there 's nothing you can do to stop me . You 'll never get away with this . Looks like he will . Bring me the Batman . He 'll pay for putting me in exile . And then Gotham will finally , rightfully , belong to me . - You bet . - Got a score to settle first . Hey , Nightwing . Good to see you . You must not be getting my texts . - I got them . - Oh , but ... More urgent stuff to deal with right now , Flash . - Can 't say I expected to see that today . - Can 't say I expected to any of this today . Come on , guys , this is Gotham . Time to settle up , Croc . Happy to . Batman , it 's Nightwing . It looks like our big problem just got even bigger . I have eyes on it , too . We have to shut them down before Gotham is destroyed . - Good work , Robin . - There you are . What 's happening to me ? Freeze 's formula , it 's ... He 's unstable . Whatever freeze did , Clayface can 't handle it . Here , it 's the key . - You said you wanted to drive the Batmobile . - I kinda took that back . I 've got a plan , but I need you to buy me time , try to keep Clayface from destroying the city until I get back . - That 's a pretty tall order . - I know you can do it . You need a ride ? - I 've got one . - Is your ride invisible ? Wait for it . A new batcycle ! Nice ! You 'll have to show me how to get the spikes to work ... He does that to everyone , doesn 't he ? Even ... even better ! Instead of crushing you , now I 'll burn you ! Okay , what does he usually do ? This is the ignition , right ? Can 't run from me . I don 't know what I was worried about . This is awesome ! How do you do plane mode ? Plane mode now ! Oh , yeah ! Eat missiles , lava breath ! Where is he ? - Time to go to the workshop . - Batman , it ... it 's not ready . Giant monsters are loose in Gotham . Consider this a field test . Don 't start without me . There you are ! - What are you doing here ? - You 'll see . - The magnetometer might me miscalibrated . - That won 't be a problem . But Batman , you don 't understand . Some of the servos are registering at sub-optimal PSI readings . Doctor , I 've seen the specs . I can handle it . - Nice . - Boot it up . - Forget something ? - Oh , of course . - I think that 'll do . - You ordered your own mech ? You think you 're the only billionaire in the world ? I convinced Langstrom you might need some backup . The Queen Industries contract helps support research and development . We filed a report . Let 's go . - Welcome , Batman . - Prepare to deploy . Copy that . Actuator systems , nominal . E systems , 100 % . Weapon systems , online . Wait for me . Launch in 10 , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Launch ! This is one sweet ride . Green Arrow , you 're on Chemo . Stop the freezing process . - My pleasure . - Langstrom , I need something else from you . You do ? Masked freak , zero . Croc , everything . We can now confirm the mysterious freezing conditions falling over Gotham City are a result of an attack by supervillains . Come on . That was my favorite TV ! Is that Batman ? You know , your mouth runs faster than your brain , speedster . Who else would that be ? What 's this button do ? Oh , yeah ! - Nothing 's stopping this guy . - I 've got you , boy wonder . It 's impossible to stop me in this thing . And by impossible , obviously , I meant totally possible . Which one was it again ? Had it under control the whole time . Keep Clayface from destroying the city , Batman says . Sure , no problem . - Robin , come in . - Dr. Langstrom , is that you ? Yes , Batman sent me . I 'm headed your way , fast ... too fast . This vehicle travels far too fast . Yeah , it 's awesome . What have you got ? Batman has a plan for dealing with the lava creature , but it 's only at the design stage . Hey , Chemo . The kids of Gotham are happy to build snow-forts and have snowball fights in summer . But enough is enough . Hello , I 'm talking to you . Okay , now you 're just hurting my feelings . Let 's try that again . Which building you want , Buzz ? You can have your pick . Who 's there ? Mr. Cobblepot , you 're back . We haven 't seen you for some time . You 're going to be seeing a lot of me now . Care to know why ? Because Gotham belongs to me now . And not even Batman can do anything about it . Oh , yes , meet my right-hand penguin , Buzz . I 'm naming him head of security . Nice to meet you , boss . Yeah , I think it 's time to retire . It will be the most powerful laser cannon ever constructed . In theory . Don 't worry , I 'm sure we can get this thing going . This should pull in enough amps . Okay , that 's most of the stuff . What took so long ? You 've been gone for , like , two full minutes . Some of the things on the list were only available in Central City . - Excuses . Excuses . - Here , I 'll go get the rest of it . So , Dr. Langstrom , this Cannon will be powerful enough to cut Clayface down to size ? - Batman hopes so . - Great ! Wait , " hopes " ? He doesn 't know ? Well , the last time a giant lava monster attacked Gotham was , never . So , no , we haven 't had a lot of chances to test it out . You think some robot 's going to stop me ? Just one of your toys . Here 's another one . I 'll break your machine , Batman . I 'm going to pry open that shell of yours , Batman , so I can get to the soft center . Thank you for doing my dirty work , detective . With Killer Croc out of the way , I 'll be able to enjoy my dominion over Gotham . You plan to dominate Gotham as the Penguin 's flunky ? The Penguin is a means to an end . Looks to me like he 's sitting back and watching you do all the work . Tell me , Batman , between Penguin and me , who is the bigger man ? Don 't forget what they say . The bigger they are ... This day at the beach is turning out to be no day at the beach . Computer , are all of these buildings evacuated ? Affirmative . No life signs detected . - Show me which ones I own . - Displaying now . Good , ' cause I have great insurance . That one needed a renovation anyway . Yeah . You 're sure it 's ready to be tested ? We don 't have time to work up a better prototype . That 's a good sign . - And that 's a bad sign . - Batman 's not going to be happy . The contrivance wouldn 't have worked anyway . - What did you do to it ? - Nothing . The design was flawed . It couldn 't support valence co-sharing between the bonded particles . He 's right . Should have thought of that . No one tell Batman , okay ? Why are you here ? We know it was you who put Gotham in a deep freeze . It was , but I was foolish . - You 're here to turn yourself in ? - No , I 'm here to help . As if . We 're not getting fooled by that old trick . Are we ? Why would you want to help us clean up your mess ? Because it is my mess . All I wanted was to be left alone in my desolate land but Penguin convinced me to assault Gotham . I was manipulated and then betrayed . - I 'll admit , that makes sense . - Really ? 'Cause all I 'm hearing is , " I 'm a bad guy . I 'm a bad guy . I 'm a bad guy . " You said something about helping . - Nice and slow . - This is one of my arctic devices . Coupled with your Cannon , it could be an effective weapon against Clayface . But what is ... Oh , I see . Brilliant . He 's right , it could work . But he 'd have to help us set it up . - Then the question is , can we trust him ? - No . Maybe . I better call the boss on this one . Your mech has a back . I bet I can break it . Langstrom 's laser 's a bust , but Mr. Freeze is here and says he can get it to work . - Do it . - You think you can trust him ? - Imagine being partners with the Penguin . - I 'd rather not . Working with the Penguin is an easy thing to regret . Victor 's whole personality is built on guilt . He 's got enough of a conscience to want to make amends . Got it . Robin out . Well , well , well . Who knew that 's all it would take ? Oh , no . Me and my big external speaker . Anyone ever tell you your power is kind of gross ? Fine . How about call it a draw ? Done yet ? How about now ? Now ? The Flash pestering me does not encourage my success . So we do have something in common . Yeah , but Flash is right . You need to be done . - Done in one more minute . - Not sure you 've got it . Or we can be done now . Now 's fine . Fire ! It worked briefly , but we need a sustained blast . Without his freeze suit , these temperatures could kill him . Dr. Freeze , let me operate the cannon . Get away from the lava . Only I can manage the arctic device . How much more can he take ? Your freeze suit , where is it ? I just wanted solitude . Watch out for the acid thing ! He loves to do the acid thing . What 's happening ? Hey ! Hey ! I think I need that . You cracked him ? No one 's ever cracked him . - I like what I 'm hearing . - Green Arrow , I 'm trying to concentrate . Oh , sorry . Let 's see if I can help . I think we got him . Can I talk now ? Did we win ? Mayor Cobblepot . No , Governor Cobblepot . No , no , President Cobblepot . No , no , Lord Cobblepot ! That has a nice ring to it . What ? Melting ? This isn 't supposed to be melting . Where are my monsters ? What are they doing ? Here comes one now . What ? We 've stopped them all , Penguin . It 's over . No . No . No ! Curse you , Batman . No . Hey ! You should 've seen the look on you face when we came around the corner . Priceless . They 'll be fine , once they wake up back inside a cell in Arkham Asylum . Almost there . So very hot . I found it . - Let me help you . - Thank you . What 's gonna happen to him ? He 'll get a trial , and I imagine he 'll be back at Arkham with the others . - He saved us . - Yes , but I caused all this as well . It 's all right . Perhaps I can request solitary confinement . I might find the peace I 've been looking for . One more . You may have beaten me this time , but once I 'm free ... Enough ! I 'll have the last laugh over all of you . Don 't forget his pet . All right , calm down now . What 's gotten into this thing ? Remember that hole you guy 's blew out on our floor ? Good news . During labor detail , you can help with the reconstruction . Fantastic ! Well , well , well . When I vowed to get even , I had no idea it would be this soon . What are you going to do to me , clown ? You 're in that cell , and I 'm in this one . You were saying ? Not the beak ! Look , Daddy ! I 'll have to replace the forward actuators . Clearly , new struts along the port side . I can fix this . Oh , no ! What did he do to you ? I heard you let the new kid drive the Batmobile . - Yes . - I didn 't get to do that for years . The northern lights are supposed to be great in Finland , but they start in 20 seconds , so , I have to leave soon . Great working with you again , buddy . I 'm not your buddy . What a kidder ! There 's a Queen Industries building down by the harbor that needs some reconstruction . See you when I see you , Bats . Batman , I know I haven 't been the new Robin for very long , but thank you for taking me out on this mission . I learned a lot . Robin , I owe you . The whole city owes you . We couldn 't have done it without your help today . Thanks . That means a lot . Hey , I was going to go train . Want to come ? You can help me learn how to do those quick getaways you 're always pulling . Okay , let 's go . Alfred , you 're on watch duty . Of course , sir . Have you really been to a whole planetwide amusement park ? - Yes . - How was it ? Enjoyable .

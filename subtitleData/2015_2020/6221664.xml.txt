 Woman : Previously on stitchers ... You will look back and know that you were part of something very important . You didn 't warn me people could get hurt . - It was a suicide . - I think you 're wrong . This is a picture of ed and my mother . Who 's been ripped out of the photo ? Man : Impersonating a police officer . Are you insane ? He 's innocent . I feel it . That 's what i 'm worried about . Stitching affects you . It makes you different for a little bit . It doesn 't always last , but sometimes people get hurt . Kirsten : What 's going on with you two ? Going on ? Nothing . Is this what love is ? Intense connection and then heartbreaking loss ? Is it worth it ? I don 't know . If you figure it out , tell me . ( machines beeping ) She 's seizing . Cardiac arrest ! - ( shouting ) - ( gagging ) - Vitals ? - Cerebral temp is 104 . - Heart rate 155 and climbing . - Bounce her out of there . Woman : Somebody , get over here now ! ( beeping continuing ) Marta , talk to me . Your exit pin code . Man : I need assistance , stat ! - Marta ! - Memory collapse , ten seconds . - Marta , make the bounce ! - She 's tachycarding . - Bounce her out of there . - I can 't without a stable bio-com connection . I can 't get a clear line . - Five seconds ! - We don 't have the time . If i rip her out now , her mind could fry . If you don 't , she 's gonna die . ( gagging ) We 're losing her . Bounce her of there , cameron , now ! ( cell phone beeping ) - ( cell phone rings ) - what ? That 's how you answer the phone ? Where 's my cheery hello ? - I don 't do cheery . - You know , smiling more often Can relieve stress , lower blood pressure and boost immune system . - You should try it sometime . - Why are you calling me Instead of talking to me here in person at the lab ? Wow . You are so not a morning person . I 'm not an anytime person . - Time of day doesn 't- - - matter to you . Right . If you 're gonna make me do a physical , you could at least be here yourself - On time . - I hit snooze a few times too many . I didn 't sleep well last night . So what did ayo tell you ? How 's your blood pressure ? Ekg ? Any side effects from being stitched ? Fever ? Vertigo ? Actually , i do have A giant pain in my ass . Go ahead . Mock my concern . There 's no reason to be concerned . I 'm fine . - Damn . - You don 't want me to be fine ? No , i want my neighbor to stop stealing my magazines . - What ? - I moved from the loft below mine a couple of months ago . Now the guy in there now refuses to put his name on the mailbox , So he keeps getting my magazines . And you are mourning the loss of popular geek ? No . Molecular gastronomy . I like to stay current , but he hoards them . - So man up and go get them . - You don 't understand . - This guy is- - - large ? - Odd . - You should get along just fine then . Funny . Okay , fine , i 'll go . But if you don 't hear from me in an hour , look for my head in his freezer . ( beeps ) Robbie . Hey , it 's cameron . From upstairs . Hello . Love what you 've done with the place . I knew it . God damn- - Robbie , it 's bad enough you steal my magazines . You don 't gotta dog-ear the pages , too . ( sighs ) Why don 't you consider your own subscription ... Canceled . ( theme music playing ) ¶ take me inside ¶ ¶ take me inside ¶ - Poor guy . - Was he a friend ? Yeah , we passed each other in the building a few times , but he wasn 't big on small talk . Or housekeeping . So was this a robbery ? I doubt it . Valuables and artwork are still here . If you wanna call this art . It 's a ginsberg . Well , mrs . Ginsberg must be very proud of her son . Looks like an execution . Two shots in the back at close range . Like a hit by the mob ? Easy there , don corleone . What do you know about this guy ? Not much . He was a paralegal , i think , at a firm downtown . Who liked to steal your magazines . At least you don 't have to worry about that anymore . Okay , the man is dead . That 's your silver lining ? Whoa , what does she mean , he stole ? I used to live here . He never took my name off his mailbox , So our mail gets mixed up . What 's with the looks ? Maybe you were the target . Huh ? Fisher : It 's possible . The victim 's about the same age and build . In the dark , someone could easily have mistaken him for you . But why would anyone want to kill me ? You 're a neuroscientist that works for a secret government agency on technology That could change the world as we know it . - There is that . - It 's just a theory . Okay , well , let 's go with a different theory . The one where my neighbor had enemies who wanted him dead . We can 't rule anything out . Actually , i can . What if that was meant to be me ? Don 't jump to conclusions . Fisher is interviewing his colleagues , friends , and family . And ? Well , so far his colleagues didn 't know him very well . No family to speak of . And his friends , well , there aren 't many . So he 's a loner . There 's no motive to kill him . Whereas with me ... Does anyone outside of the program know the nature of your work here ? Not that i 'm aware of . But what about inside the program ? Tim from engineering never liked me . The more probable scenario is mr . Peterson was involved with some bad people . It seems like he hardly left his apartment . You never know what goes on behind closed doors . I do . At least i will when you stitch me in . Ready ? Hey , there . Whatever . Whatever ? I called . I texted . Got nothing . Oh , you think i 've been dodging you ? Well , fyi , unlike kirsten i did not take a leave of absence From the university to be a stitcher . I had an optogenetics presentation . I put myself on total lockdown to prepare . You 're going with the optogenetics story ? You know , " needy lover " Never looks good on anyone . We hooked up , followed by radio silence . I took it as a comment on my performance . I didn 't realize you were waiting for a review . - I thought we had a good time . - No , we had a great time . We did ? I mean , yeah , we did . Of course we did . - Wanna grab dinner tonight ? - I don 't think so . I thought we had a good time . Absolutely . Emphasis on " had . " Linus , how 's it looking ? Like a crash and burn . Come again ? Bio-com signal is coming in steady and strong . Double-check please . As i said , we 're good to go . - Blood pressure ? - 117 over 76 . - That 's up from a minute ago . - Because you 're bugging me . Check her temp . ( beeps ) Still 98.6 . - Please , can we do this ? - Fine . But when you 're in the stitch , if you feel anything unusual- - I 'll be sure to let you know . Stations , please . Lights at 20 % please . I need a go , no-go for stitch neurosync . Life-sci . We are a go . - Sub-bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go , go . - Communications ? - Yeah , go . - Medical ? - Go . - Cameron : Comm check . One , two . - Kirsten : I hear you . Are you sure ? Because we can boost the reception if- - I said i can hear you . Not sure i want to . Fine . Initiate stitch neurosync on my mark . In three , two , one ... Mark ! ( sighs ) i 'm in . He 's reading a magazine . Of course he is . One of mine ? - Do you subscribe to chart scope ? - No . Looks like our mr . Peterson was into astronomy . Is this close to the time he was shot ? Cameron : No . I wanted to ease you into his final moments . - Why ? - He was shot twice in the back . That could be very traumatic for you . I 'm a rip-the-band-aid-off fast kind of girl . I can handle it . You need time to adjust . You do , i don 't . Is everything okay ? Kirsten 's just being very difficult- - No , i mean with you . Let her do her job . Fine . Brace yourself . I 'm shifting you as close as i can to the time of his murder . ( inhales ) ( sighs ) ( helicopter whirring ) Cameron : What do you see ? He 's at the window . ( helicopter whirring ) A police helicopter 's overhead . It 's downtown l.A. That happens . - ( door opens ) - someone 's here . - ( gasps ) - kirsten , what happened ? He was shot in the back . He couldn 't see who did it . Well , did you hear the shooter say anything ? Like " these bullets are meant for you , cameron . " It could have happened . I can 't tell if it was meant for him or for you . Awesome . There 's a telescope here . It 's glowing . People , we have a glowing telescope . Looks like a memory hot spot . Something of special significance . Okay , gonzo . Check it out . Robbie wasn 't stargazing . He was spying on his neighbors . A peeping tom ? What did he see ? Maybe something he shouldn 't have . Something that got him killed . - So our victim was a voyeur . - Fancy word for pervert . We 're not here to judge . We 're here to solve a murder . At least it wasn 't meant to be yours , bro . We still don 't know that for sure , bro . - Did you see anyone suspicious ? - Not overtly . Besides the usual peeping tom stuff . Details , please . What ? There were a few things in particular i felt robbie emotionally drawn to . A jogger , someone painting someone 's fingernails , And a girl in a tank top going to her refrigerator . Details , please . What ? Also a guy who looked like he had a knife , yelling at his girlfriend . Maybe one of them caught robbie spying on them and killed him . I think tank top girl clocked robbie looking at her . If she did , why kill him and not just report him ? At this stage , those apartments are our only leads . Linus . Can you identify the apartments ? It 's hard to say . All the windows look very similar . What if you look from the windows at robbie 's place ? Maybe one would look familiar . His apartment is an active crime scene . Fisher is gonna have trouble justifying our presence there . - What about cameron 's ? - What about cameron 's ? Well , your place is right above his . It has practically the same view . That is worth a shot . Cameron ? ¿ mi casa es su casa ? I like the vibe in here . Geek chic . I really could see myself living here . Yep , i can 't . All right , put something under those legs . I just had the floors redone . Maggie really came through with the gear . What 's the point of having an unlimited budget if we don 't use it ? Where do you want me to stick this ? Never mind . Okay , were you raised in a barn ? Get that- - careful with my stuff ! - I 'm starving . - This isn 't a party . Look , i know you 're still on edge over the whole " don 't shoot me " thing , But you really need to chill . And get me a snack . He 's been acting strange all day . - No , i haven 't . - Yes , you have . Yeah , seriously , lighten up . You 're being so anal , you 're giving colons a bad name . My friends , we are live . It is a good day to spy . So the guy in 5a is dressing his cats up In little outfits . Some people like to dress their pets . As ballerinas ? ( mutters ) The girl in 6c is tipping the pizza delivery guy , And she- - Holy ... Pepperoni . Okay , this is an invasion of privacy . - We have to do this . - Yeah , i know . But people have a right to their secrets . Not if those secrets are hurting other people . Don 't pout , pumpkin . I don 't want you mad at me . I 'm just a little confused as to why you don 't want to ... Repeat performance ? Well , listen , maestro , i mean , it 's simple . We shared a lovely , spontaneous , In the moment experience . - You forgot hot . - That , too . And now it 's history . History can repeat itself . No , history should stay in the past . You can 't go home again . What about third base ? ( door opens ) Look at this . You guys are nothing if not well funded . Hey , fisher . Did you crack the case yet ? As of now , still no motive for the killing . The victim led a simple life . Worked 9 : 00 to 5 : 00 and spent his off-hours at home . Any progress here ? I 've ruled out some windows , But there are plenty still with their curtains closed . So no sign of tank top girl or knife guy . How long are you prepared to keep this up ? - As long as it takes . - She 's addicted . I can stop anytime . I choose not to . Kirsten , i have to tell you something . It 's about ed clark . After an extensive investigation , we found no evidence of foul play . Lapd is officially ruling his death as a suicide . So that 's it ? - You 've closed the case . - Yeah . I 'm looking forward to the day i prove you wrong . Me , too . Doughnut ? Contrary to popular belief , all cops don 't love doughnuts . - Suit yourself . - Hold it . - Is that a chocolate glazed ? - Check it . Fisher likes sprinkles . Don 't judge me . I got him . Is that who you saw in stitch ? Yeah , he was arguing with her when robbie saw them . Looks like they still are . What a douche . Kirsten : Knife . - Which apartment is that ? - 7c . Requesting back-up , Apartment 7c , 652 south broadway , domestic disturbance . - Suspect with a knife . - Yo , this isn 't good . Come on , fisher ! - ( gasps ) - we 're too late . He killed her . Son of a bitch ! Come on , fisher , get in there . Finally . Get that bastard . ( sirens wailing ) Oh , my god , the girl . Fisher , find the girl . She 's not dead . It 's a painting . - ( sighing ) - oh , my god . The guy 's an artist . He uses this palette knife to fling paint on a canvas . In this case , red paint . But i saw him fighting with his girlfriend . It was about money . She says they always fight about money . In fact , she had one foot out the door , But stuck around because he finally sold his first painting . What was his name ? One of those artsy types . He goes by a single name . " ginsberg . " The painting in robbie 's apartment . Robbie bought the painting . Why ? I 'm not sure , But i feel ... Robbie was trying to help . So our peeping tom is a peeping good samaritan ? I don 't know yet . ( clattering ) Is someone there ? ( door opens and closes ) What are you two doing here ? We needed to calibrate some gear And thought we 'd grab something for dinner . - Would you like an egg roll ? - No , i 'm good . Did you see anyone getting in or off the elevator topside ? No . Okay . Enjoy . Camille . Camille . ( sighs ) - Camille ! - ( gasps ) - Huh ? - Oh , you 're up . Well , now that you 're awake . Really ? Here ? Get over yourself . I thought you and i could talk . What do you need ? A bedtime story ? I need to understand what went wrong . Oh , my god . Why are you harping on this ? Because you and i are good together . If things went too fast , we can slow down . Hang out . Go to dinner ? Hold hands and take walks ? I don 't want that . Not with me . Not with anybody . I 'm just really diggin being single right now . Okay . How about now ? You 're still at it . Yeah , still no luck finding tank top . Meanwhile , 6f has been a very naughty boy . Okay , you need a break . I 've never seen people this way before . You mean , how they behave when they think they aren 't being watched ? Not just that , but being vulnerable . Real . It 's intoxicating . I get why robbie was obsessed . Oh . Whoa . Looks like naughty boy Is playing " fifty shades of 6f . " I think you 've seen enough . What 's your problem ? I 'm just looking out for you . No , you 're smothering me . Ever since that phone call this morning . All of the extra precautions at the lab , - And all of this hovering . - I 'm being responsible . I 'm not your responsibility . Yes , in fact , you are . When you 're in a stitch , And you 're waltzing around some dead person 's memory , It is my job to keep you safe . I know what i signed up for and i know all the risks . All the risks ? No . You don 't . Everything that happens in the lab is recorded . Archived for future reference and analysis . Okay , so ? I need you to see something . Cameron : If i rip her out now , her mind could fry ! - Maggie : If you don 't , she 's gonna die . - Woman : She 's seizing ! - Cardiac arrest ! - Cameron : We 're losing her ! Maggie : Bounce her out of there , cameron , now ! What went wrong ? Marta stayed in too long And she couldn 't make the bounce by herself . By the time i got her out , it was too late . She died ? No , but she was damaged . She 's been in a coma for the last four months . It was an accident . It wasn 't your fault . No , i can 't risk anything like that happening again . I can 't risk you . Hey , guys ? You 'd better come in here . Lady and gentlemen , may i present - ( snaps fingers ) - tank top . Apartment 6b . She just waved at us . And just invited us over for a beers . No way . - Dude , you have to . - Dude , i 'm not going over there . Come on , cameron . Take one for the team . She obviously knew robbie was watching her , and she obviously didn 't mind . - And robbie is obviously dead . - Fine . Whatever . I 'll go . - Like hell . - You jealous ? Disgusted . It 's not like you have to sleep with her , But this is a good way to find out what she knows about robbie . - What if it 's a trap ? - Seriously ? What kind of trap ? Okay , let 's say she saw robbie spying on her . She 's upset . Yeah , she seemed livid . Keep going . Okay , now let 's say she has a boyfriend . Big guy . And now let 's say he 's waiting in the other room . Let 's say threesome . I swear , if you don 't stop with the comments- - It 's not a trap . I know . Robbie felt some emotional pull to her . - Maybe she feels the same way . - Even more reason not to go . I can 't play with people 's emotions like this . ( knock on door ) I got this . - It 's her . - I got this . No . Get in the bedroom . All of you . Oh , no . Now . Uh ... Hi . - Hi . - Hi . Hi . Again . Didn 't you use to live in the apartment below ? Yes . Yeah , i did . I- - i moved . Oh . Well , why didn 't you come over ? Didn 't you see me waving to you ? Um , yes . I noticed something like that . Listen , i 'm not who you think i am . I think you are . You 've been watching me for months . I know you have . Listen , yeah , about that . I 'm sorry . Don 't be . I model for art students . So i 'm kind of used to being stared at . Oh- - So why are you here ? To thank you . For watching you ? For sending over all those groceries . When they first got delivered , i couldn 't figure out who sent them , And then i realized that you could see into my fridge and you saw it was empty . Yeah , i noticed that . I 'm gonna pay you back just as soon as i can . But i just wanted to tell you i know it was you , and to thank you . The world needs more people like you . And any time you want to come over for that beer , You know where to find me . We had robbie all wrong . He wasn 't a peeping tom . He was a good samaritan . ( elevator bell dings ) - Any success ? - Let 's just say mission not quite accomplished . We did eliminate two suspects , but still haven 't found anyone with a motive to kill robbie . Turns out he 's not a bad guy at all . - Seriously ? - Camille : He bought a painting off a struggling artist , Sent groceries to a poor art school model . The guy was spying on people , but he was trying to help them . Well , obviously , someone didn 't care for his brand of help . Stitch me back in . I must have missed something . I don 't advise it . The timing 's too tight . What 's left of mr . Peterson 's memory is about to expire . I have an idea . Something i want to try . What ? I 'd rather just do it . If i tell you , nervous nellie here won 't let me . If you don 't tell me , cautious cameron is going to say no . Let me do it . It 's going to be fine . What if his memory collapses while you 're trying your little experiment ? I 'll bounce out . Trust me , just the way you want me to trust you . Talk to me , goose . What do you see ? Robbie is enjoying his favorite pastime . So what 's this bold experiment of yours ? If robbie has been watching the building since he moved in , That 's two months of watching people in their most private moments , right ? Two months of learning their secrets . - Go on . - His life was based around the telescope . I 'll bet it 's hypercharged with emotion . Her brain activity 's off the charts . Why ? What is she doing ? Kirsten , check in . What are you up to ? Kirsten ? ! Relax . I 'm speeding through robbie 's memories from the last two months . There 's an apartment on the third floor ... What do you see ? Curtains . They 're always closed . What 's inside they don 't want people to see ? - Maybe it 's vacant . - No , the rental company for the building claims 100 % occupancy . - Memory collapse in 20 seconds . - Get out of there . Hang on . Do not bounce me . The mannequin in the window . It 's a signal . They 're transporting something . - Kirsten , your exit pin code . - Linus : 15 seconds . - There 's a helicopter . - Ten seconds . - Nine . - I 'm bouncing you . - You know you can 't do that . - Eight . Seven , six ... Five ... Four , three , - Two . - I heart linus ! ( gasping ) I told you to trust me . What happened ? What did you see ? I think robbie 's killer . The apartment was built in 1942 . There are two entrances- - one in the front with a doorman And one in the back through the alley . Now the original storefront on the ground floor used to keep inventory upstairs In apartment 3c , which they used to move merchandise with a private elevator . The boutique that we saw in kirsten 's stitch- - daisies and dots- - That occupies the same ground floor space . Apartment 3c is leased to the same owner . But what are they using it for ? To store women 's clothes ? Maybe , if they 're stolen . It has to be something illegal . Why else would they go to the trouble to keep it a secret ? And then use the mannequin to signal the van ? Mannequins aren 't creepy enough . I 'll call fisher . He 'll need to get a warrant . Looks like your neighbor may have stumbled upon something after all . And paid for it with his life . ( accented ) lifeless eyes . Black eyes . Like a doll 's eye . - Anyone ? - Jaws . Quint 's monologue . Classic spielberg . I feel ya , bro . Why is quoting movie lines such a guy thing ? The freaky mannequin 's arm is down . Which means they 're in a holding pattern . Any activity in the apartment ? Camille : Nada . The blinds are still down . - Where 's fisher already ? - Maggie said he 's on his way . Where are you going ? To the back entrance of the building . I need to see what 's in that apartment . Right , ' cause you haven 't done anything reckless or foolhardy in almost an hour . Okay , don 't take your eyes off the stiff . Keep us posted . Roger that . Okay , 3c should be at the end of the hall . - Hey . - What ? Thank you for going through with the stitch before . I know you didn 't want to . Wow . An expression of gratitude . You must think i 'm an awful person . Actually , all things considered , on certain occasions , I 'd say you 're pretty remarkable . Talk about a qualified compliment . Okay , we still need to have an understanding . If you ever feel uncomfortable in the lab Or experience any side effects , Promise you 'll tell me , k ? If you promise me no more secrets . You should 've told me about marta . You 're right . And i 'm not her , okay ? You don 't have to worry about me . That i can 't promise , But i 'll try . 3f , 3b , 3d . Where 's 3c ? ( sighs ) Apartments don 't just disappear . What are you doing ? A trick ed taught me About how to find an empty space behind a wall . - ( thuds ) - okay . There is a large gap behind this wall right here . Someone plastered over the door ? - What are you doing ? - A little reconnaissance . I need to see . We 're in the apartment . We need to hurry . Someone would 've heard that . Who lives like this ? Cameron , take a look at these . Vietnam , afghanistan , mexico , turkey . All women . They 're human traffickers . We better call fisher . Get him down here now . Hey , wonder twins . You there ? - Yeah , what 's up ? - We got a high-five from the mannequin . Kirsten : Let 's go . Van 's here . Right on cue . What are they loading ? I can 't see . They must be loading the van through the side door . Kids , the van 's leaving . Hurry ! ( engine turns over ) ( siren wailing ) Police ! Hands in the air . Hands in the air ! Hands in the air ! Hold it . It 's okay . You don 't have to hide anymore . ( sighs ) now i 've seen enough . Fisher said that the driver confessed to killing robbie peterson . Wow , he was a guardian angel after all . I mean , without robbie , all those women would have been lost . Now we know that cameron wasn 't the target . - To robbie peterson . - To robbie . Wait . Cameron should be in on this . I 'll go get him . - Should we wait for them ? - No . - No . - ( glasses clink ) ¶ in love , you were in ¶ ¶ in love , you were in ¶ ¶ and the only thing that i was told ¶ ¶ always sail away a feeling ¶ ¶ if the sea of hope is calm ¶ ¶ just surrender to your being ¶ ¶ i 'm all ¶ ¶ around you ¶ ¶ and if the dark is blinding ¶ ¶ i 'm all ¶ ¶ around you ¶ ¶ we 'll run forever with the lightning ¶ ¶ i 'm all ¶ ¶ around you ¶ ¶ if the dark is blinding ¶ ¶ i 'm all ¶ ¶ around you ¶ ¶ we 'll run forever with the lightning ¶ ¶ i 'm all ¶ ¶ around you ¶ ¶ and if the dark is blinding ¶ ¶ i 'm all ¶ ¶ around you ¶ ¶ we 'll run forever with the lightning ¶ ¶ i 'm all ¶ ¶ around you ¶ ( theme music playing ) ¶ take me inside ¶

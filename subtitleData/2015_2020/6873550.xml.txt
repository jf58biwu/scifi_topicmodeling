 You got the right idea . Oh , yes , back to work . Hey , there 's the man of the hour . - Happy birthday , man . - Thank you . How you feeling ? Feeling older ? Feeling wiser ? Well , it all blends together after a little while . I wouldn 't touch that . I 'm gonna eat all of it . That 's what 's gonna happen . Whoa . See that ? Come here real quick . Glen , can you bring up visual on the shaft real quick , please ? Visual 's coming up now . How far down are we ? We are passing the 1,000-foot marker ... now . Let 's take it further . - Can we pick up the drop ? - Yeah , speed that up . 3,000 feet . Ohh ! What was that ? You seeing that ? Can you rewind that , take it back ? Sasha ! What the- - that 's c-shaft , isn 't it ? Yeah . All right . - Be safe . - Yeah . Bring that back up . Sasha ! Bill ! What 's going on ? ! Oh , my god ! We got a war going on down here . A global assault on a scale the world has never seen . We have reports that these invading creatures are terrestrial and of subterranean origin . The world 's military forces are making no gains against these masses and are heavily outnumbered by what some are calling " demon hordes . " Reports of mass migrations and the beaching of thousands of marine animals along the European coastline appear to be precursors to the eclipse . If we 're still on the air , stay in your homes . Take shelter . Our nation is under attack . Similar events are happening all over the world . We want to repeat , take shelter now . After 24 horrific hours and a second eclipse , the world needs to recover . No one knows what this means for us . The president has proposed the creation of a new department of homeland security : The dhs , which will ensure the preparedness of our nation in the months and years ahead . Military installations now circle the globe and all deep-core fissures . These facilities , known as " gates , " will stand guard against the dire possibility of another event , that harrowing 24 hours of terror known as the " day of reckoning . " There you are , buddy . Not doing so well , are you ? Seen better days ... You and me both . Come here , little man . I know . This sucks . Ehh . Sorry , little buddy . Time to go home . All right , we got it . Bagged and tagged . - Ooh-whee ! - What do we got ? Next time , Ramon , i think you should go in . God damn ! Is it still alive ? Nah . Too many jellybeans , i think . Poor little guy never had a chance . That asbestos thing , by the way , hasn 't gone away yet . That 's next on my list . Boss , I 'm serious . - Yep . - It 's kind of a big ... Yeah . No , the other way , the other way . Thanks a lot , Mr. Wilson . Appreciate it . All right . Hi , Laura . Hi , Milton . I need to borrow your skeleton . Sure . It 's right over there . Oh , thank you . Um , I was wondering . I mean , I know your ex-husband has your son for the weekend , and obviously you 're gonna have to eat , so I thought that you might ... That 's , um ... That 's very thoughtful of you , Milton . It just ... Rain check ? Ah , sure . Yeah , I understand . I 'll put that check with the others . See you later . I 'd love to . You would ? Love to what ? Have dinner . You would ? Well , okay , then . No more rain checks . I will pick you up at 8 : 00 , promptly . See ya . Here 's the thing . He doesn 't know . He likes her . See that girl right over there ? Yeah . She 's good . Stop ! - You gonna do it ? - Go talk to her . I 'm sorry , but your beautiful smile has entirely distracted me . Okay , no make-out session in front of your friends . You worried about the eclipse tomorrow ? Yeah . I mean , they say that millions of people died . Hey , don 't worry , okay ? I mean , there 's been so many eclipses since , and no monsters . Yeah . You know , I 'm staying with my dad this weekend . Yes . And your parents are off to palm Springs . Yes . Well ? Are you asking me out on a date ? Yes , I am . I mean , as long as you don 't have other plans . Stop . You think your dad will let you ? Yeah . I mean , he 's pretty cool . My mom doesn 't think so , but he 's a lot less parental than my mom . And controlling . What happened between them ? Me . Well , and the reckoning , but ... I don 't know . They just kinda split up after I was born . But it 's like , " what are you gonna do ? " I just try not to think about it . Well , at least your parents are around . Yeah ? Hey , man , we need you down here right away . We just went red . There 's been major seismic activity below the two-mile line over the last eight hours , and it 's converging . The other facilities have confirmed activity , too . I don 't think this is a drill . This is the real deal , and we are a go on containment . Oh , man , yeah . Brought my girl down here , man . - Chief . - Huh ? I don 't think this one 's a drill . I don 't know , man . But we 'll be ready this time . Ain 't something I 'm inclined to go through again . It 's all good , yeah ? Honestly , I think it 's broken . Hey . How 's it going ? Good . It 's good to see you , too . Where 's your mom ? In the kitchen . Hey , Laura . Hey . Sorry I missed you last month . And the month before that . And the month before that . It 's okay . You look good . You , uh , heard about the eclipse on Saturday , yeah ? Yeah , everyone has . And you 'll be with him for it , right ? Yeah , yeah . But I 'm not looking to have a heartfelt conversation about what happened 15 years ago , if that 's where this is going . That 's not where this was going . Why do you always do that ? You always turn everything back on me . I don 't do that , Laura . You do that . Really ? I 'm just here for our son . - Honey ? - Yes , I am ready . I 'm actually waiting on you guys with my bag at the door . Are you done ? Do you see this ? Do you see what you do ? I know . - I love you . - I love you , too , mom . Have fun and be safe . And I want him home Sunday evening , please . Yeah . - Can I drive ? - No . Oh ! Jiminy Christmas ! We lost grid 7 ! Aw , man ! They don 't pay me enough for this , man ! 12-b , copy , copy . If it 's mom , I 'm asleep . - Yo . - Dave ? Dave , it 's uncle Ted . You know what 's going on ? You gotta listen to me very carefully . It 's like one in the morning , Ted . What the hell does that matter ? Stella sent you a map in an email . It 's uncle Ted . No , no comprende . Speak slowly . Pretend like you 're talking to an idiot . Apparently I am , smart ass . I 'm talking about what 's happening . I 'm talking about another event . You got till about midday tomorrow to wrangle up your family and get your ass up here to barstow before the eclipse . What we 're reporting now is a second mass die-off in the Gulf of Mexico within hours of the Norway event , which scientists say is eerily similar to the events preceding the day of reckoning . Hey , dad ? Dad , you 're gonna want to come see this . The second sign will be a mass migration . It 's happening all over the world again . Fears mount for the second precursor that would signal another event like the one 15 years ago . The final sign ... The eclipse . It 's god 's way . The world has become very evil . This is his way of cleansing his world . It 's his world , after all . He created it . - We were given a warning ... Ted ? David , it 's Laura . Have you seen the news ? Yeah , of course . It 's been on all night . David , please , I want you to bring Tyler home . Milton 's made arrangements at a shelter . Laura , you can trust me . I 'm his father . - He 's safe here . I don 't trust this house . - He 'll be safer with us . - Us ? That is not what I meant . Can you not do this right now ? This is not a joke . I want you to bring Tyler home now ! Okay , yeah , you win . I 'll , uh ... Yeah , I 'll bring him over right now as soon as he 's done with what he 's doing . What do you mean ? What is he doing ? Yeah , he 's working on a project right now . It 's for school . I 'll have him right over . What is this ? " 555-2674 . " 555-2674 . 555-2674 . Tyler , Tyler , Tyler , buddy . All right . Come in . Laura , everything 's been prearranged with the shelter , but we gotta get there early before it fills up . I can 't find Tyler . Oh , that 's okay . We got time . Let me show you a trick . Where 's your computer ? - It 's right there . - Ah . That your phone ? That 's his number ? - Yeah . - Okay . Uh-huh . - Skate park . - Yeah . How could it happen on such a beautiful day ? - You think we 'll see tomorrow ? - Don 't say that . Maybe it won 't even happen . And you know what ? If it does , we 'll hide . A lot of people survived . Don 't leave me . Not even for a mondo board with spitfires . Hey . You know , my mom , she says my dad wasn 't there for her when she needed him most . I won 't do that to you . I promise . Holy crap . Look at that . It 's the second sign . They 're swarming everywhere ! Come on . This can 't be good . What the hell is going on ? Oh , my god . - Check it out ! - Let 's get out of here ! Uh , maybe I should reconfirm our reservations at the shelter . Let 's go . Yes , this is Milton sing . S-i-n-g . I have a reservation for five . Back online . Carl ! Please ! No ! Tyler ! Tyler ! Dad ! I oughta wring your neck , buddy . I 'm sorry . She had nowhere else to go . I 'm so sorry , Mr. Shepherd . - Wait . What is that ? - Emergency sirens . - I didn 't know we had those . - Yeah , me neither . Come on , let 's go . - My skateboard . - Nah . We 'll get it later . Come on . Uncle Ted 's got some kind of bunker in the desert . We need to get your mom and get out of the city . - Come on , this way . - Tyler ! Tyler ! Oh , hey , speak of the devil . Tyler ! Let 's get in . All right , come on , let 's get in . Perfect timing , Laura , as always . Hey , Milton . David . You know your way to barstow ? We 're going to the topanga shelter . I told you Milton made arrangements . We have a little over an hour , you guys . Right . An hour it is . You know your way to topanga , Milton ? Yes , I know my way to topanga , David . I just don 't remember going this way . David , please . - How far ? - We 're fine , we 're fine . Ah , shit . He 's coming ! Lucifer ! Come on , come on . We 're not gonna make it . We are gonna make it . That 's just her being positive . What ? ! Jeez ! Wait ! Repent your soul ! There it is . Women and children , let 's go ! Step back !

Sorry , sir . Women and children only . Come on , David , we gotta get out of here . Come on . Ah , sheesh . - Please . Hurry up . - Hold up , hold up . No , I 'm sorry . - Tyler ! - Tyler ! Tyler ! - No , Tyler ! Damn it ! - I 'm not gonna leave you ! No ! He 's my dad ! I 'm gonna stay with him ! Listen to me ! Please come in . That 's it ! Shelter 's full ! No more people ! - We are at capacity ! - Please listen to me ! Hey , shelter is full ! No more people ! - We are at capacity ! - Sir , please listen to me ! I have my family here .

We gotta find shelter now . There are women here , and children ! Come on , let 's go . No more people ! No more people ! I 'm sorry ! Oh , my god . Oh , my god . They 're not picking up ? - No . - It 's going to voicemail . Yes , it 's going straight to voicemail . Oh , my god . Oh , my god . David , are you sure about the house being reinforced ? No , I just said that . Breathe , Laura . We can still make a run for Ted 's place in the desert . The desert ? Are you kidding me ? We 'll never make it . We 'll take the back roads , avoid the highway . - We 'll be out of the city . - We have ten minutes . - We have to find somewhere now . - I know where we 're going . We 're gonna go to the school . It 's only a few minutes away . - We have a secure basement . - It 'll be mobbed by now . And that basement isn 't secure . There 's ten different ways in , and kids go in there all the time to make out . Young man , just trust me . It 's gonna be fine ! - It 's the place to go ! - The basement isn 't secure ! Everybody , just calm down ! Just breathe and calm down . We 'll be fine ! It 's a secure basement . Milton . Is he still not picking up ? - What do we do ? - It 's all stopped . - Nobody 's moving . - What is going on ? What 's happening ? I can 't go anywhere . We 'll figure it out , guys . Laura , go see if there 's a door . Tyler , see if there 's some opening . See if there 's anywhere to hide . Come on , there 's a door there . I 'll go over here . Yo , dad ! I don 't know what to do ! It 's locked up . I can 't get in . I know . Get in the car . Guys , we gotta go now ! They 'll tear the school apart . We gotta get out of the city . I know the way to the L.A. river . We can take it all the way to the dirt . - I 'll drive . - Let me drive ! Hey ! I got it . No ! No ! You 're not gonna get me killed today ! - Get in ! - This is my car ! Milton ! Milton ! Milton ! Get in the car . Get in the car . Dad , go , go ! Drive , drive , drive ! Oh , my god . Anything ? No . Maddie , you still with us ? Yeah . We 're gonna be okay , all right ? All of us . How far is Ted 's ? Hundred miles or so . Hey , it 'll get us out of the city , all right ? Do we have weapons or anything ? Does salt really kill them ? Yes . And cold . Why would god do this to us ? I mean , is this really a part of his plan ? Honey , we 're not ... We 're not sure where these things come from . Nobody knows why they 're here or what they want . We call them demons , but that 's just one of many theories . Some say it 's god 's will . - Are they here to test us ? - Maybe . Others think they 've just been here for a very , very long time , just hibernating . Just waiting . Is that what you believe ? I don 't know anymore . - What ? What was that ? - We need to find a new car . - What ? - How much further ? - 20 miles or so . You don 't know . Hey , it 's not my car , Laura . I didn 't fill it up . We just gotta find a new car . Dad , what is going on ? We need a new ride . - Hey , what about that one ? - Yeah . Everybody stay here . Laura , get behind the wheel . If you see anything , just get out of here . Drive . Be safe . Is there someone in there ? Jesus , look at that . Oh , my god . - Ohh ! - Oh , my god . Mom , no . You 're gonna catch his attention . Go , go , go , go , go , go ! Where is it ? We 're close . Oh , yeah . This is it . All right , Ted . Told you guys . Teddy , we are here ! Hey , uncle Ted ? - Knock again . - Ted ! Uncle Ted ! Hey , I know you can hear us . We 're here . - Hello ? - Ted , buddy ! Can you hear me , Ted ? Uncle Ted . Ted , hey , I know you 're in there . Open up . Uncle Ted , can you hear me ? Teddy ! - Teddy ! - Is there another way in ? - Is he even inside ? - Yeah , he 's in here . I 'm just gonna grab a rock or something . See if you can get his attention in the big one . Ted ! - He 's in there . - It 's Laura . Open up . - We 're here . - Ted ! He 's in here . Ted ! - Are you sure he 's in there ? - Yes . Ted ! Ted ! Yeah , it 's motion activated , it 's just gotta- - it 's gonna alert him .. Ted ! Ted ! Come on , Ted . Come on , buddy . I know you 're in there . Dad , what are we supposed to do ? You guys just keep trying over here . I 'm gonna ... Just keep banging on that door . Dad ! Ted ! Hello ? - Aw , man ! - Ted ! Are you sure that this is the right place ? Yes . I just talked to him . Dad . Dad , mom , they 're coming ! They 're coming ! I know ! Goddamn it ! - David ! - He 's here ! Come on . Try the door again . Try the main doors . Find something . Just- - David ! David ! Okay . Come on , come on . Come on , come on . Ty , give me a hand . Stand on it . Uncle Ted , please let us in ! - Ted , Ted , Ted ! - We gotta go now ! Get back , get back . Uncle Ted , if you can hear me , please just open the door . Please open the door , uncle Ted . Dad ! David , get in ! Dad , dad , dad , it 's open ! - It 's open ! Come on ! - Go , go , go ! Okay , go , go , go ! Close it , close it ! - Everybody okay ? - We 're good . Ted . Ted ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't hear you until you started banging . Awesome place , Ted . Saltwater sprinklers . Thanks , kid . - Hi , I 'm maddie . - Hi , maddie . - Nice to meet you . - Thank you so much . - Stella , hey . - I 'm glad you made it . Laura , oh , my gosh . I 'm so glad you 're here . David , you were supposed to be up here before the eclipse . David , this is Garrett . Corporal Garrett Jensen . Homeland security . David Sheppard . That 's my kid Tyler , and his mom , my ex-wife . Garrett 's father and i were in the Gulf war together . I got , uh ... I got separated from my unit . Lucky for me , I remembered Ted here had this place , so here I am . That was lucky . My sidearm bothering you , friend ? Guns make me nervous . Ain 't that the point ? They gonna do that all night ? They probably will now . The buzzards know we 're here . Nothing is getting in here without an invitation . I can attest to that . If I was you , I think I 'd feel lucky to be in here at all . This is one of those days that no one should have to live through , let alone a second time , but we are going to . We 're gonna survive this . All of us . Now how about we get dinner started , huh ? Burn through some time here . You guys made it just in time for one of Stella 's all-time special recipes . Right , baby ? I guess so , if you like stew . - Laura ? - Plenty of stew for everyone . What ? Yeah . That would be great . Is anyone listening ? ! Pardon me . The world 's gonna be a different place by morning . It 's gonna be a long night . Give me a hand with this . Can they see us through the walls ? - Like by heat or something ? - That 's not how it works . - How 's it work then ? I don 't know exactly . Like they say , movement , light . You know what I think ? I think they see right into you . Right into your soul . I think it 's crystal clear that these things are the devil 's work and therefore , creatures of god . They 're here to test us . Test you . Test your spirit . Test your guts . They might tear your flesh , but they 're feeding on your soul . Are you a religious man , corporal ? I am today . Were you in the military during the first day of reckoning ? I was on a refinery 15 years ago . Down south in Louisiana when the first one hit . They come right up , right up from underneath us . Black things with black eyes , clawing and tearing . 157 of us on that rig , and all of them- - I ran . Ran right into this refuse pond right out back , and it was so thick with salt , it was like mud . And I just buried myself in that white slop . I could see them in the skies though , charging and stomping , attacking anything that moved . Millions . Millions . So I stayed there , just watching . All my workmates , all my friends just getting eaten alive . But that 's why they call it the day of reckoning . It 's the day god gives to the devil . How about some of us try to get some sleep , huh ? Yeah , sure . Yeah , I think a little shut-eye might be good for us all , huh ? I 'd be happy to take the first watch . And I 'd be happier to have another touch of that intoxicating whiskey , miss Stella . How about a game of cards ? Yeah , sounds good . You guys play . I 'm beat . Come on , Laura . One game . You and me versus Ted and Stella . It 'll be fun . I 'm good . You guys play . I 'm beat . - Good night , guys . - Laura , just one game . I don 't think he wants you to go to sleep . All right , why don 't we all just relax- - whoa . Okay . This is what we call " military intervention . " Now , why don 't you just put that knife back on the table there , friend ? What the hell is this ? He 's been holding us hostage , Laura . Did you just clue into that ? Ted , he was not gonna let me in , but Stella , she 's got a real soft heart , bless her . Bless her . I just need the shelter for the rest of the night . Then we can all go our separate ways . Just calm down . I 'm really losing my Patience , with you , Ted . Hey , we 're all in here together . This is crazy . No one 's gonna do anything . Why 'd you have that knife ? It 's down now . Just put down the gun . You know what 's going on out there . You don 't wanna bring that in here , right ? No one 's done anything to you . I 'm starting to feel like I 'm- - I 'm not really welcome here anymore . Yeah , okay , think about it . What are you gonna do ? You gonna shoot us ? Start piling up carcasses in here ? You don 't think they 're gonna smell that ? I 'll do whatever i gotta do . I survived the last one , okay ? I can survive the next one . Yeah . Ty ! Oh , all right . Nice try . Nice try , really . Ain 't gonna be no heroes today , okay ? - Now ... - Quiet ! - Listen . - What ? I 'm not hearing anything , right ? I mean , where did they go ? It 's too quiet . Stella ! Well , it works on vampires . Oww ... It 's gonna be all right , baby . Dad ! All right , get down , get down . Tyler , get over here and tie him up . Tie his hands . Ow ! Oh , god . - Laura , find where it came in . - Oh , my god . She needs medical attention now . Stella , look at me , honey . You 're gonna be okay , okay ? We don 't have much time . Stella , honey , look at me if you can , okay ? I 'm right here , okay ? Sorry , guys , we gotta wrap ' er up , we gotta go . We 're not leaving , damn it . I can 't help her out there . - It 's okay , Stella . - I 'm okay , I 'm okay . I can do it . I can do it . Okay . We won 't last two minutes when they get in here . Those doors will hold . Not for eight hours . We 're running out of time . There 's a back tunnel , leads to the canyon on the north side . Good cover . You go . Y 'all just gonna leave me here ? Ted , you know what 's happening to me . You can 't stay here , baby . I got a vehicle . I hid it in the valley about two miles away . I didn 't tell Ted ' cause i didn 't think he 'd let me in if he knew I had a ride . - Another goddamn lie ! - For survival , Ted ! It 's called the day of reckoning , not the day of let 's all just be best friends . It 's got a full tank of gas . I can get you a long way from here . And go where ? The gate . The gate 's about- it 's only 12 miles away . - The gate ? That 's your idea ? The gate ? That 's where these monsters came from . They 're not there anymore . It 's a secure facility , and they got safe rooms for personnel , but I can get you all in . All of y 'all . You got a better idea ? Why didn 't you mention this before ? I got cut off . I told you that ! They 'll have medical attention there . All right . Let 's go . You get us to your facility in one piece , maybe we 'll forget about tonight . Right ? Hmm ? I 'll get you there . Whoa ! Shotgun . I call it . Rock salt rounds . Grenade launcher . Street sweeper . Hey . You never know . I 'm good . It 's time . How much further , friend ? I 'd say it 's about a couple clicks . That 's military speak for a kilometer . Yes , smart ass , i know what that is . Just keep on point . Ohh ! - I 'm fine . - You 're okay . I could help y 'all carry stuff if I wasn 't tied up , you know ? You don 't need your hands to walk , corporal . Keep moving . Think we can trust him ? Yeah , for now , as long as we 're all at risk . You know ... I just ... What ? I didn 't say anything . It 's just your timing . As always , it 's- - well , not everything revolves around your schedule . Are you guys seriously gonna do this right now ? We should be in that shelter right now with everyone else . Not out here , like last time . - This isn 't like last time . - Why ? - ' Cause you 're actually here ? - Mom . Sorry , buddy . - Tyler- - - it 's dead . - Doesn 't matter . Stand back . - Don 't touch it ! Get back over here . Looks like it 's in pain . Like it 's screaming or something . It 'd be a really cool instagram . Come on , get your stuff . Let 's go . Maddie ! Sorry , I 'm coming . Help me , Tyler ! - Tyler ! - Maddie , maddie , maddie ! Come here ! Come here ! Maddie , no ! No ! No , no , no . Let 's go . Go , go , go , go ! David , I can help . Come on , let 's go . You gotta be kidding me . Shh , shh , shh . What was that ? What ? Jinn . I set that kill switch . - Start the car . - Come on ! Start the car . I forgot I hit the kill switch . Stella ! No ! Stella , please ! Stella , please ! Stella ! Stella ! No ! Give me the gun . No , Stella , no . Don 't do that , Stella . Stella , don 't do that . Don 't . Don 't , Stella , no . Don 't you dare ! Give me the gun , Stella . Give me the gun , Stella ! No ! No ! Give me the gun . Stella , please , give me the gun . Give me the gun , baby . Give me the gun , honey . Give it , give it to me ! Come here , Stella . Stella , come to me . Ted , that 's enough . No ! Come here ! Stella ! Stella ! Come here ! That 's enough . We gotta go . They 're coming . Come on , get in ! Go , go ! Now ! Go ! Go ! We gotta go ! - We gotta go ! - Stella ! Drive ! Stella ! Stella ! Stella ! - Come on , go ! - No ! Drive now ! Now there 's been no break in the attacks so far . The whole area was under siege throughout the night . Evacuation centers did not hold , and topanga shelter was leveled during the attack . Our early reports indicate that there has been mass destruction of multiple safety zones in that area . Unit five-four-niner to base . I 'm carrying wounded civilians . Over . This is five-four-niner . Do you read ? Over . Anybody there ? Why would they have the door open ? I don 't know . Let 's go see . Do you mind ? I thought you said someone would be here . There should be , unless something went wrong . Where is everyone ? I don 't know what happened . Maybe they 're all in safe rooms . Where are those ? Lower level . Basement . Ted . Your back . What the hell ? It 's nothing . Do you guys got a hospital here ? Not at this end , but there 's a supply room ... Downstairs . All right , corporal . Down we go . We gotta get this power back on , so we can actually get into the safe rooms . Get me to the machine room . I can do it . It 's up here on the left . I 'll show you . And medical 's all the way down the hall . Come on , maddie . Hey , go with them . I 'll , uh ... I 'll catch up after I get this knocked out . Are you ready , sweetheart ? They 've been fracking this hole for years , flooding it with saltwater as a defense measure . They even pulled a mountain of salt from the local flats , but the hole 's too deep . They kept us on standby in case it ever happened again . Oh , great . Laura , will you grab that ? Careful . Careful , careful . How does it look ? - Hey . - Not too bad . Whoa . Go , dad . - You 're pretty handy . - Let 's go find those guys . Get down to a safe room . They 're inside . Go , go , go , go . It 's gonna sting just a little bit , okay ? Where is he ? We should hurry it up . You see him ? Hey . They 're inside the facility . We need to get somewhere secure . We only have two hours left . That can be a long time . There 's a storage room where we first come in . Volatile chemicals , so the doors are blast proof . Good . Let 's go . How 's he doing ? David ! Gun ! - Hey ! What the hell ? - Hey ! I 'm sorry . Come on , come on , let 's go . Okay . Go , go , go . Come on , come on . We good ? - We good ? - Yeah . What are we gonna do ? - Water pipes ? - These are the dispersal lines , so the circulation tank must be on the other side of this wall . David . This is the easy part . What are you gonna do ? Even the odds . Come here . You 're doing a good job , buddy , okay ? I got one more job for you . You take care of your mom while I 'm gone . Okay , these pipes feed a salinization system somewhere in here . I 'm gonna redirect the saltwater to the circulation tank . What do you need from me ? Keep my family safe . I can do that . Hey .

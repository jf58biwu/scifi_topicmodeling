Also , you can 't leave until you wrest your machine back from Rainey . [ Electricity crackles ] But , aha , another wrinkle ... The bad guys had figured out how to use what was originally a glitch in your time machine to swap souls into different bodies . Rainey could literally become a different person . He used this ability to stay young and grow more powerful , eventually confronting you . Rainey said ... " Our group is growing . You can 't hide it forever . Just surrender the machine you 're using to make energy . " And then you said ... " I can 't do that . " " This is gonna be a war . Then everything from here on , the blood is on your hands . " It already was . You 've spent decades waging a war in secret , trying to get ahead of your enemy . The hippies renamed themselves " The Men of the Machine , " and Rainey made good on his promise ... It was war . They wanted your unlimited energy device ... and you needed to get back the time machine that was now a soul swapper . But you couldn 't get the upper hand . Things seemed hopeless . Your life was dark , and you were full of rage . Could you keep living like this ? [ Groans ] That 's when something you never expected happened . You fell in love . [ Distorted ] Are you okay ?

This investment - -and I 'm talking about the time to modify the aircraft from an A380 to an A390 . has cost me over 100 million u.s. dollars . this could be another Titanic . And I want you to make sure that you take care of the Prince . Its under control sir . I know he 's our golden goose . I 've even invited a popular singer he 's quite fond of .

Our exclusive priority-only A390 will be taking off shortly . and fasten your safety belts . Good job ! making this announcement to so few people .

She couldn 't cook . the best way to a man 's head is through his stomach . I know your business is tanking . you pick now to debut a luxurious airbus ? There must be a juicy story here . I don 't think I need to explain why we 've chosen Global News Network as our exclusive partner . desperate for your coverage on our successful first flight . Mr. Gao . I 'm sure you won 't regret it . Okay then . Excuse me . This plane is incredible ! entertainment lounge and bar . It 's like a flying castle . they say it can fly into space ! sweetheart just all alcohol for me . HEY it 's really you ! I love watching you box ! I love watching your acting . Ah ... So what are you here for Me ? you . not just somebody in show biz . You must be Rodman . I 'm Khadsa . Associate Chief of the Yan Shang Group . Big fan of yours . Much respect . That 's ancient history right there . But you know what ? It 's time for me to do my own inspection . why don 't you bring me a something little stronger to inspect ? Right away . I 'm just gonna put this in a fore cabin for a moment and I 'll bring it right back after take-off . Will there be enough room ? Oh yes . The storage compartment on this plane is big enough to fit a grand piano . I should have brought one ! You 're so sweet ! Mr. Kim . Really ? Yes . It was a summer trip fifteen years ago but I 'll honestly never forget that night . It will be an honor to play for you again later . Master Chef . I was looking for a chili sauce for my shifu 's recipe . Kelly said it might be down here I hope your secret sauce is enough to meet expectations tonight . Kay . let 's see . This ... and this . Kay . am I late ? our surprise mystery guest has arrived Colin ! my man ! superstar ? how ya doing ? Excellent ! I can never get use to you wearing all this gold and flashy stuff . Tell me how 's livin ' the big dream ? Can 't complain right ? I knew it ! I knew it was you ! Can I take your bag ? Thank you . on behalf of ocean airlines ... I 'd like to welcome all of you aboard ! cheers ! Cheers ! Why are you here ? to see my old college friend . You 're dressed like a hood rat ! Don 't cause me any trouble ! Peter ! excuse me . Yeah ? huh ! ? Yeah ? I found out that they were roommates at Yale . Best buddies ! You 're a smart-ass . He 's popular ! Very popular ! Mia only agreed to shoot this because of ... and I didn 't ? I don 't ever want to see you again ! You can kiss my ass . Check . Check . Check . ever again . Just goes to show how much the company values you . So how we looking out there ? Any chance of a live performance by the big superstar ? Mr. Gao clearly isn 't a fan . Looks like Peter kissed his ass in the wrong place . Isn 't this rich prince the guy we 're trying to impress ? inviting the guy 's old classmate . how do you feel about this A390 ? enough power to fly beyond the atmosphere ! you just hand it back before landing . Screw you . Jason only chose you for this debut because he thought you needed more training . Don 't get me involved with this guys ! you 're needed ! we 're about to take-off right now . pre-flight check Ruoxin you 're needed downstairs after take-off . Make sure you tell the media you were once a flight attendant with us . Tell them that - - We give everyone at Ocean Airlines an oppoflunity to grow . I. Am . Not . A. Flight . Attendant . Anymore . Serving guests isn 't really my responsibility now ! Monica and I will be enough . you see ? This isn 't any normal flight ! Even Mr. Gao is out there sewing . we need you to do ! you 're not the one flying today ... Kung Pao Chicken . That isn 't new at all . a thousand different chefs will make a thousand different Kung Pao Chickens . I 'm Chef Mike . I 'm from Sichuan . There 's only one Kung Pao chicken in my menu . Why isn 't Chef Liu here ? he had high blood pressure that doctor wouldn 't allow him on board . ... What do you think ? How 's it taste ? You 're telling me a Chinese Sichuan chef sent an American to cook Sichuan food ? I am his protege . My shifu just wants to share Sichuan cooking with the world . Did you know Marco Polo learned about spaghetti from the Chinese people ? Ugh ... Why are you here ? You should be out there with our guests ! You should be on the first floor ! did you ? Blackjack ! Mr. Rodman . I haven 't been so lucky since my last Hong Kong Film Award . my dear Best Actress . Luck comes with good liquor . Cheers . Lost in the Pacific every time . Your voice tells so many stories ... Thank you . I 'm sure we have a lot of time on this flight so I can tell you more stories . Really ? ! Thank you . there 'll be plenty of press waiting for us . And by next week the stock in Ocean Airlines will skyrocket . it 's a win-win . So you 're on board with our merger and acquisition ? I think it 's looking good . Very good . I 'm sorry . with Global News Network . Can I ask you a few questions ? but I need to go to the cockpit now so it 's not really a great time . if you 'd like ? does Ocean Airlines plan to replace all of its captains with such beauties ? where they target the wealthy ? you should ask Mr. Gao . Hey bro ! It 's been a long time . Whaddya say we rack ' em up ? What are we playing for ? How about this plane ? Cause it 's gonna be yours . Sooner or later . Please excuse me . You two have fun . a stage two code black emergency ! What is it ? Can you tell me why the Sichuan food 's being cooked by an American ? Peter . ya know that ? I haven 't seen him since he was 18 . Do you have any idea what you 've done ? Reuniting me with this juvenile at a critical time ? he 's your son ? He wants to make a fool outta me ! Your son is a superstar ... not an entertainer the story is coming . How come the storm sprung up like that ? Weather forecast didn 't say anyihing about it . I 've never seen anything so massive . What did control tower say ? They say we 're crossing the least stable area in the Pacific . Control tower knows nothing about the weather here . What happened ? Gary . We have some pretty severe weather buildup in the area . We 're gonna need to re-route . This is the most sophisticated commercial aircraft to date ! but you must land my plane in Hong Kong on time . we definitely can 't land on time . we need to bypass this . That 's gonna take at least two hours . Two hours late for Hong Kong ? can you fly faster ? it won 't be a problem . It 's like a spaceship . And it gulps up fuel . We have enough for the original route - Rio to Hong Kong . The fact that we need to bypass ... We need to land and refuel . No ! We are not stopping ! We 're gonna keep going ! It 'll take at least three hours to get to the never mind refueling time . Which puts us at a five hour delay for Hong Kong . Minimum . There 's no way in hell I 'm gonna allow that - the media 's not gonna wait around for five hours . the whole thing 'll be a big joke ! we have to . Thunderstorms in the Pacific Ocean are no joke . We 've got no choice . Think about the lightning just now . please . you guys are the best pilots I 've got . That 's why you 're here . I don 't care . Just fly above the storm ! we still need to refuel . Just fly through the damn storm ! Will you ? tell them that the safety of this aircraft is completely reliable . now make a personal annoucement to the passengers . This is gonna get bumpy ... Head east but nobody knows who he is . WOW ! How about ... I 'd like to give you a long interview . Yeah . It 's a deal ? ORB ' ! - I feel a bit dizzy and scared ... shhhhh . Don 't worry about that . I heard they have a nice suite . Why don 't we go and explore ? Why are you still here ? Koushui Chicken . Wanna try ? Get this mess cleaned up . and buckle in . Are we landing already ? I haven 't got reviews on my food yet ! How are we doing ? Could be worse . Somewhat . Height ? Just passed 45 . Still climbing . ORB ' ! - Oh ! We 're in trouble . Descend . check the perimeter . check the pod wing . Get Gary in Asap . ORB ' ! - please come with me . Quickly . Bob ... Flood her again . We have to shut the pod engine down and land the plane . Lightning strike on port engine . Fire alarm has been activated . Engine 's on fire ? no flames . But the alarm 's still on . Auto fire detection system 's cycled twice and the light 's still on . or we 're at risk of combustion . We have to prep for a landing and have a look at this plane . She 's right . Where 's the nearest airpofl ? which enables us to bypass . That 's too far . There must be at least a landing field or something closer ? we can 't keep risking it ! okay ? we can 't be late for the live broadcast . The only other option we have is an abandoned airport at Fortune Island . It reads at 30 nautical miles . we are gonna inspect the plane and moving on . there 's low visibility . There are rumors about that island ... some kind of supernatural monster . Nobody lives there . Even the military pulled out . My elite pilots ... Please don 't tell me you 're afraid of darkness and some crazy fairyiale ! It 's not a fairytale . one of our flights was attacked while trying to take off from this island . There was no concrete evidence from that investigation . No one knows what the real cause of the damage was . will you ? Set coordinates for Fortune Island . prepare passengers and cabin crew for landing . everything ok ? Tell everyone we got to land . Yeah . Just shut up and listen ! Just say ... we have prepared a little surprise . okay ? Everyone . We planned a special experience for all of you . A short stop at a Pacific island . will bring you luck . a pristine tropical island ! So romantic ! And what if we don 't wanna go ? we 're just rerouting for a bit to bypass thunderstorms in the area . and possible radar loss to the weather . Captain . This is reckless . We 're violating countless aviation regulations . shut down transponder . This is way more exciting than I pictured . Feels like we 're on Mars . I 'm gonna go check the engines . I 'll go with you . Me too . just in case . prepare emergency hatch . So exciting ! Are we getting off ? I 'm so sorry . But on this island there are a lot of ... nocturnal animals . Its not safe to get out . from right here inside the plane . No signal ? What 's the point of being anywhere if you can 't post selfies in front of it ? So boring . this is so cool . What a beautiful Island ! So what 's your lie of the day ? Why 're we really here ? Don 't mess this up . I 'm still your father . Father ? " Did you just call yourself my father ? you never cared . You didn 't even come see me . You know what ? You pretty much killed mom ! Chef Liu . so let me invite you to go upstairs and enjoy some of his very special Sichuan cuisine ! Peter I 'm going out for pictures . Come grab me when we take off . Okay ? no . no- - I 'm a VIP . Miss Ren ? Mr. Gao ? What problem ? Don 't play dumb . I know we forced a landing on this island . What do you want ? after all . is that it ? You got it . Come on . Go with them . No one leaves the tarmac . Stay close . We 're taking off soon ! There are monsters on the island ... Sure you don 't wanna come ? I 'd rather stay here ... You sure we are leaving the tarmac ? Of course ! can you run some diagnostics on the engine please ? I 'm seeing some scorch marks here . But ... no internal damage what does it say ? it 's here . All right ! Looks like both engines are fully functional ! We gotta go . Something 's wrong with this place . Can we leave ? we 'll take off soon . can you prepare the cockpit for departure ? You 've gotta be kidding me . There 're really monsters here ? even on the plane . you mean that actress ? Or the boxer ? Be careful . Ahhh ! film this ! Who let them out ? I can guess who . Just help me get them back . Hurry up . we 're leaving ! keep filming . It 's an honor to be here . and was lucky enough to become Chef Liu 's apprentice last year . enjoy ! I say it 's great ! I love it . Ocean Airlines is offering Sichuan cuisine on all international flights out of Hong Kong next month ... What 's going on ? Something wrong with the plane ? I think Mia Ren finds something interesting to shoot ... save for - What 's that ? Maybe it 's a fox ... so this is the monster ... be careful ! Bob ! Run ! get me to the ground . get the plane ready to takeoff . You see that ? This is what you call a VIP experience ? get everyone downstairs and ready for takeoff ! Prince . take off right now ! close the hatch ! Now ! Get us started ! Hurry ! Jason ' ) . ! Jason ! Hurry up ! Jason ... Jason ... we 're taking off ! Let 's g0 ! Close the hatch ! Right now ! asshole ! Ouch ! Peter ! I got you ! We 're running out of bullets ! Let us on ! they saved us ! the rumors are true ? What 's going on ? what 's your guys ' story ? about how we must look . We 've been held up in a warehouse for the last two weeks . no one showed up ... It 's surprising to see a commercial aircraft land there . this is Sergeant Nikki Lee . sent to Fortune Island on a blockade mission . until we ran into those creatures . There 're just too many of them . the island was already out of control . for two weeks we fought hard until we 're the only survivors . then you guys came along . I 'm sorry to hear about your men . But thank you for saving us . Of course . Mr Gao . Who 's in charge here ? lam . president and CEO of Ocean Airlines . Mr Gao . My pleasure to give you help . I 'd like to extend my most sincere apologies for the recent accident . they will be taking over . Accident ? Are you out of your mind ? Two of our men just died ! stock market prices are way more important than human lives . You ungrateful little brat . Who 's been spending a small foflune on you his entire life ? are you publicly admitting that I 'm your son ? Yeah . that this is my self-centered father ! It 's my son . I see it now . You 've totally got his nose . so you planned all this ? Just so I would invest ? that was never my plan . not since I divorced his mother . And you know what ? You never showed up to her funeral ! make sure they are comfortable . our next destination is Hong Kong . I could use a cup of tea . Please try to enjoy the rest of your flight . I 'm fed up with this special experience . I 'm gonna get some sleep before landing in Hong Kong - the clever man . shouldn 't you go upstairs ? do you ? So you are my boss now ? Didn 't think so . I 'm sorry ... Yeah . Going down for pictures and two people are dead . Couldn 't call headquarters for backup ? Our comm was down . What were you using for relay ? but it was damaged during the fight . The creatures destroyed everything in the airport . All we could do was wait for rescue . Chef . That 's okay . He used to be in military . Ex-soldier ? No wonder ! So you are ... not a cook ? I 'm absolutely just a cook now . I retired a long time ago . I just can 't trust someone who keeps their finger on the trigger . It 's alright . but this documentation will prove we belong to the United Nations Biological Crisis team . one is ... Whafl ? The communication equipment was damaged during that last takeoff . What ? but to trust each other . we need to reach these coordinates as soon as possible . About 500 nautical miles from here . anything you would need . That 's not necessary . We can make it to Hong Kong . Mr Gao . Not in this storm . This flight can 't afford any fuflher delays . I 'm afraid . These coordinates are right in the middle of a dangerous area - a Bermuda triangle of sods . it 's not a regular route . I guess I 've got to make myself clear . Our incident has forced this flight into a state of emergency . the UN will take control of the flight . Is that understood ? A takeover ? That 's not up to you . does it ? it 's a secret base . and the intel on them is top secret . the authorities set up this base near Fortune Island as containment . To prevent it from getting worse . So we appreciate your ' cooperation on getting us to our headquaflers as soon as possible . Basically you are saying that we need to get brainwashed because we saw the mutant cats . Are the Men In Black there waiting for us ? Doesn 't matter - I 'm against it ! they 're just some weird-ass creatures on a primitive island . It 's hardly a global disaster . those two . I trust them . is the safety of your passengers . I am concerning about our passengers and we should land in Hong Kong . and we know how terrifying those monsters were . We should cooperate . Ruoxin ? You still working with Ocean Airlines ? I 'm the captain . Jason is gone . We 've violated Aviation Regulations anyway . it 's too risky to fly through the storm . Captain . That 's it . I have final say as captain . It 's not that simple . I 've made up my mind . The communications equipment was destroyed on purpose . Not during that fight . the creatures were on the ground . Listen- - and you 're brave . But how can you tell whether it was on purpose or not ? Because I led a specialized counteflerrorism unit . Knocking out comms was an everyday thing . How do you prove any of that ? All I see now is a cook who makes terrible Sichuan food . we 're in big trouble . I need to keep everyone safe . do you understand ? I understand . Just let me help you . We are running out of fuel . if we keep our route and fly through the storm . These coordinates give us a chance . We 've got to try . OK . Our safety is my main concern . There 's no better place to land within two hours . We have no choice . No more casualties . Understand . Trust me . I respect your decision . We 'll have a safe landing . I got him killed . Don 't say that . so was he . I understand . ... It 's like how I devoted to music . Thank you for saving me . reporting the story of you and your father . No big deal . I know this is your work . I always saw myself as an observer . I never expected to be part of the story ... Don 't worry . I 'll tell everyone that Bob was a hero . Why don 't you just head up and relax with them ? I 'll go with you . Me too . ... Are you spying on me ? Shouldn 't make an innocent man uncomfortable . looks like you enjoy your tea . I do hope our setback just now won 't influence your assessment of Oceanic Airlines . the unexpected circumstances have proved too much . a reassessment is necessary . Only to chat . Just curious . What are you looking at ? None of your business . Can I ask a question ? What 's a beauty like you doing playing with guns ? I forgot to introduce the both of you . Yan Shang Group . Not every man is born rich . Your Highness has unique taste . I got to ask : why become a chef after retiring ? don 't you think ? I haven 't thought about it . Mr. Gao would like to see you upstairs for the next meal . Right ! Time to cook something good ! do you have anything to drink ? Anyihing . What would you like ? Jamison . and sick of pretending to be some son of UN force . You are gonna play ball a little bit longer . we got off that island ! they 'll find out ! Calm down ! now we gotta do is sell it to the buyer ! I will take care of him . no more killing . but I also promise a huge amount of money . Enough for you to take care of your little boy and live happy ... This has nothing to do with my son ! This has everything to do with your son ! not because of me . So you are listening . Good . at any cost . Is the weather getting any better ? keeping clear of the storm ceiling . We 've changed direction to avoid the center of the storm . I invested to train you as a pilot and you are disobeying orders ? Is that how Jason trained you ? Jason ? Jason taught me to do what a captain should . It 's a shame that he couldn 't tell you himself . It was your decision that got him killed . I am not going to repeat his mistake . Seems you don 't wanna pilot my planes in the future . That 's fine . Mr Gao . She is dead ! Lily Young - she 's dead ! Who found her ? She died so horrible ... so tragically ... Vincent is already in there . Everybody just stay calm . I 'm going in . What are you doing ? ! I 'm the captain . I have the right to deal with any threats . I suggest you don 't irritate them right now . the situation is under control . We may have to quarantine . this where the party at . Who are you ? man . I 'm afraid I have to ask you a question . There are reports saying you have difficulty controlling your emotions ... when you are not sober . those paparazzi hopped my fence ! What do you mean ? I 'm violent ? ! and as captain I 'm obliged to investigate . Investigate what ? What happened ? ! We can 't disturb the body right now . the military police will board the plane and handle it . And thafll be in ... ? Half an hour . Good . Half an hour . please show your passengers to the first class cabin and take a seat ? What did you see ? She 's covered with blood . All over . I couldn 't disagree with you more . I think we are in a lot of trouble . He 's not who he says he is . It 's totally suspicious . What do you want me to do ? Doesn 't this all seem a little sketchy ? That 's what I 'm saying . The only way right now is to land ASAP so the authorities can take over . Captain - we should still land in Hong Kong ! Who knows what the welcome pafly at a so-called base is gonna be ! We need to land in Hong Kong . At least the Hong Kong military police and Ocean Airlines can cooperate ... Peter ! Where is Peter ? go find Peter . Tell him I want to speak with him . Ruoxin . What now ? right ? Then you tell me where . How about a crash-landing at sea ? You don 't think my suspicions are grounded ? We just lost another person . Their documentation could be forged . They just barricaded a crime scene and Gao 's assistant is missing ! They are hijackers ! Have you got sufficient proof ? what can we do ? Fight unarmed against two carrying hijackers ? How is it going ? Ten minutes left before we reach the coordinate . Now the radio isn 't working . The ATMB should have known we lost contact . Hong Kong must be worried . This whole situation is screwed up ... What 's the situation outside ? There 's a little trouble . But our priority is a safe landing . we could lose control of this plane . keep an eye on things out side . I got it covered here . Are you ok ? no command ? remember ? Except for the room where we found Lily 's body I looked everywhere . I can 't find him anywhere . The plane is only so big . How can a walking and talking human being just vanish ? I think he 's in big trouble . So it 's like Mr. Chef has became a pessimist ? We were attacked by some supernatural cats . Optimism is out the window at this point . Is there anywhere else we haven 't checked ? every cornermunless Oh my god ... It can 't be ... Anyone want his cell phone ? high-tech models . We gotta tell the others ... don 't you ? Not really what a good chef should be doing . So I was right about you ... We 'll landing soon . Try and behave until then . I know why you quit the military : because you ... can 't . ... kill . get up ! Get up ! Move . Move to the front of the cabin . Everybody sit tight ! We 'll be landing soon . How come there 's only one hostess ? Where 's the rest ? except for the cockpit . where is the rest of your crew ? I sent the whole cabin crew down to the cargo to look for him . Bring them up . What 's going on ? They 're hijacking the plane . probably Lily Young too . Where exactly are you taking us ? and everyone else on this plane . You 'd better hope all those bullets hit the bone . we 're all dead . wait . What do you really want ? my headquarters . I 'll stan executing hostages . as I 've grown to like him the least . You need me to land this plane . I promise that won 't happen if you hurt anyone else . killing the captain is not a good start Mr Chef . Captain . for the promise that I get to go where I need to go . Monica ! make her drink as much as she can . Don 't let her stop . Those wounds are full of poison . What 's all this ? Creatures made it on the plane . They knew about it . That 's how Lily died . She 's the only one alive . The rest of them should be like Lily Young . ... One of those creatures is down there . I 've sealed all the corridors . You got them killed ! You should 've warned us ! Captain . one after another . We can 't fight them in a metal bucket . one of them will kill all of us . They 're just too fast . So you 're using my people to feed them till we land ? sensitive to light . But if they can adjust t0 the brightness of the cabin ... they 'll come after us . all of us . The lounge 's more lit up than anywhere else . All right . We can barricade the stairs and the corridor . We can 't wait for death . It 's not long till we land . Captain . Watch everyone . Mike . Take everyone upstairs ! let 's go . Hey. sit ! Hey. sit ! co-pilot . Where are we ? There doesn 't seem to be any islands . there 's simply no land . Don 't worry about the land . Just fly closer to the coordinates . But where are we going to land ? Just do whatever he says . Wow ... land there . Yes ! Hey ! Sit . Down . you can . Landing an A390 on a carrier ? It 's impossible ! The plane is too big . she can handle it . I really can 't ... you need to teach your crew how to follow orders . Land . Now . listen . You can make it . Remember we did carrier landing sims at school . you beat me both times . But it was a simulator . I practiced for months but only succeeded twice ! Pretend it 's a sim training . Jason always thought you were the most talented pilot . That 's pretty good . I 'm stafling to like you more and more . Xiang . Where is every body ? This is suicide ! didn 't you ? Ruoxin 's crazy - - I begin to think you 're crazy too . and crashing strikes me as a better way to go than being eaten . I 'm not let her destroy my hundred million-dollar plane . What the hell ? ... I think you should stay right there . all my father cares about is his damn company ! punk ! I 've known that since I was ten ! I 'll never see my dad again ... I haven 't seen him for a long time ... Who knew stress could make a face so pretty . man . I will give you one last chance to land . I can 't . You have to . or dive straight in the ocean . Let me do it . You sure you can do better ? Do you have any other choice ? I have control . Get ready . Locked . Deploy the landing gear ! Pull up . The starboard Wing 's hit ! It 's just the antennae . Hold fast ! Monsters and insane women . Please just be a nightmare . Ruoxin can land this plane . be ready to unbuckle . understand ? bro . What ? That 's for you . one last time . empty the fuel tank ! Affirmative . The reduced weight will shorten the landing distance . Captain . our wing will smashes the bridge . the explosion destroys everything . But the engines can only last two minutes if we empty the fuel . this is our last chance . Let 's do it . Let 's fucking do it . Remember ! Once we touch down go full flap and help me pull the speed brakes . What if we go over the deck ? There 's no " what if " to this ! Woohooo ... Come on ! One at a time ! You take care of Mia . I 'll be right behind you . Go ! Get down ! Hold on tight . The music ... go . come on . We have to save him . I need to keep playing ... It can 't leave this plane . Ruoxin ! I got ya ! Xiang ! So sorry . He was a hero . I should 've been the last to leave . for all ofthem . Come on ! you two get over here . Where is this place ? You 'll find out later . Seem a little troubled . Things not going as planned ? Shut up ! Everybody move to the edge . That way ! get down on your knees . I will not ask again ! Good ! Welcome to the world 's largest aircraft carrier . It 's actually a shame No one else has to die . kill them . and you 're gonna see your son soon . and we need help . Captain . Help her up . she 's already wounded ! there is no need to kill anybody else . You have us right where you want us . do you Chef ? None of you do . The creatures ' teeth are toxic . She has far too many wounds on her body to survive more than an hour without the antidote . she should be grateful . all of you Watch them . Think about your son and the money . Self-destruct has been activated . Self-destruct has been activated . Dr. Han ! Dr. Han ! Hey . What the hell happened here ? At last you 're here . This is the soil sample from the cave . Where is my 20 million dollars ? Everyone died . The specimens have mutated . and it 's all my fault . Listen . I know the company has been dumping funding into your research . where is my money ? it 's going to explode . The nuclear power engine ... are set on self-destruct . WHERE MY MONEY IS ! All over . Just go . Self-destruct has been activated He doesn 't care about your life . Shut up ! He 'll kill you as soon as he gets what he wants . He 's right . Think about the child on your necklace . what are you doing ? She 's gonna kill you . Freeze . It 's okay . The poison in her body is taking effect . We need to stop the bleeding . Can you fly a helicopter ? Anything with propellers . captain ? you go find him . Why do we have to go find him ? We should just leave . That guy 's a time bomb . Who knows if we 'll make it out of here as long as he 's around to cause trouble . and help him . I 'll go with you . I know the internal layout . I will be fine . Hey ! Come back soon . Of course ! You haven 't tried my third dish yet ! We 'll wait for you . Let 's g0 ! are you hurt ? Nothing serious. ljust want to check my cello . this is nothing like the simulator . Can you navigate ? I got a private license for chasing news stories . It looks like we 're empty on fuel . go find fuel . Self-destruct has been activated . Self-destruct has been activated . Where is he ? everywhere ... be careful ... Self-destruct has been cancelled . What 's happening ? What 's going on ? Destroy the ship . Don 't let them reach land ! ... You must stop him . IWill . I just ... I just wanted to make a medicine . Modifying genes . Reversing the growth of cancer cells . I 'm truly sorry I went so wrong . let 's go ! Let 's go ! We have to leave ! Right now !

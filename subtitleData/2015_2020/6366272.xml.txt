 Previously on Minority Report ... Fiddler 's neck . Is this where you grew up ? It 's for you , Dash . I programmed this To give a 30-second warning . Uh-oh . I 've looked out for my brother . Now , we have our share of disagreements , But I 'd never let anybody hurt him . Detective Vega , henry blomfeld , deputy director Of the defense intelligence agency . They 're vetting me . A d.I.A. Job ? For six years , the three precognitives saw Every murder in d.C. Before it happened . When they went in , they were kids . I 'm not so sure They 'll do well out there in the world . Agatha becomes the person Whose future she predicts . And I feel what the victim feels . Arthur 's mind is an antenna , Pulling in names , Facts , information . How much does that sell for on the black market ? But Dash sees the horror . We can change the future , right ? Sometimes it 's the past that 's harder to escape . Dashiell ? Remember me ? My name is Wally . I 'm here to help . Where ... When is this ? Now . It 's now , Dash . There you go . Mm-hmm . One foot after the other . Okay , straight back . There you go . Your bodies will remember . Nice . Did you read the media release ? Yeah . Something about ... Sending them off to live happily ever after . Alone and in peace . And what 's the nonfiction ? Can 't say , henry . You know that . No one wants this hot potato . They disappear , We all sleep easy . My agency had plans for them . Yeah , well , who didn 't ? But it 's over now . They get to be human . Try , anyway . They aren 't meant for dry land . They won 't survive out there . What a waste . All three of your identities have been erased From every system ... Eye-dents , social security . Erased ? You mean we don 't exist ? It 's the only way to keep you safe . No one knows who you are , What you look like . There 's no cyber trail to follow . But we 'll need identities ; we can 't go anywhere without them . There are places . You 'll be given a map and cash . It 's a significant amount . We 'll take you to the sprawl . There you 'll buy a car . Car ? But we don 't know how to drive . I suggest you learn . But where do we go ? Where do we live ? That 's up to you . We don 't want to know . For your own safety and reasons of national security , Your anonymity is the best protection . How are we supposed to survive out there ? On your wits . You have a considerable amount . There were three of them : Dash , arthur and agatha . They were called the precognitives . They could see murders before they happened . For six years , our police held them against their will And used them to save lives . But after the government 's precrime program was shut down , They were finally released . They kept themselves safe and hidden from the world , Until now . It 's about that time ... get the case ! It 's about time for a ... What time did the beer ad say ? 9 : 42 P.M. I told you . But you can 't identify the corner ? I can identify the beer . Not helping . I don 't know . It looked like it happened downtown . It happened fast . 9 : 41 . One minute . No . How did we miss it ? That clock on the ad is fast . Damn ! We had , like , what , 40 minutes ? Wasn 't enough time . I 'm sorry . I didn 't see it sooner . That 's not what I meant . It 's just ... We 've been on a roll . I forgot what it 's like to lose . Hey . We should go . You don 't want to go down there and tell them what we know ? You mean tell them what we saw in your vision ? We can 't be here before the police . We have no reason to be . And they just get away with it ? Look , I 'll call The local district in the morning and see if I can help . But right now , we need to be as smart as we are pissed . So you take that feeling you have now And bring it with you to work tomorrow . All good . We 're packing him up now . You really want to gamble that much money , mr . Watson ? Apologies , matthis . Buy those stones at market value And continue this meeting at a later time . Tot ziens . Working late ? Morning in antwerp . Join me . Want a drink ? Yeah , actually . Bad day at the office ? We lost one . I tried calling you . I 'm sure you saw it , too . Downtown , right ? All I got was " third street . " Robbery gone bad . I don 't know why they had to kill the guy . Is there anything else you can give me ? Like a name ? Thought you worked in precrime , not post-crime . They have a department for that ... Same building , uniforms and everything . I could at least help with evidence . Leave it for the janitors . You got a name ? Yeah . Of a masseuse . You need to relax . She 's good with Much more than her hands . Don 't dwell on the ones you can 't save , Dash . I never did . I know what you 're thinking . It 's fine . He won 't be a problem . It 's not our case . Smart men and women are on it . Smart men and women don 't know what I know . We can help them . Why won 't you let this one go , Dash ? I 've never let any of them go . That 's why I 'm still here . There 'll be other lives to save . What if those muggers kill someone else And we don 't get there in time either ? What then ? Omri Nellas . One capital trust bank . Sterling road . Look , Vega , I double-checked , But none of the ems teams Have anything in their records . Wait , say that again , mosi . There 's no report from last night Of a stabbing in the sprawl . That 's impossible . I saw it . I saw the medics take the body . Well , no one reported it to us . Doesn 't make any sense . Wish I could help you . Um , hello . Is this the Nellas residence ? And who 's asking ? My name is Dash Parker . I 'm an analyst with Metro P.D. May I come in , mrs ... ? Nellas . Yes , of course , come in . Sorry to intrude at a time like this . I 'm sure it 's not very easy . Oh , it 's-it 's not a problem . I 'm really very sorry for your loss . Loss ? Did something happen ? You ... You haven 't heard ? Heard what ? What 's ... what 's happened ? Mrs. Nellas , he ... Omri was killed last night In a mugging ... On his way home From the bank . No , but I-i-i ... I thought he-he left on a business trip yesterday morning , And i ... I wasn 't expecting to hear from him until ... I 'm really sorry . I thought someone would have notified you . He must have been on his way home From work at the bank ... It-it happened so fast . And you 're sure about this ? Yeah , I 'm afraid so . I really ... Appreciate the visit . But you picked the wrong door to knock on today . What do we do ? We act natural . Hey . You just gonna stand there ? Hi . What can I get for ya ? You tell me . Well , our menu covers our burgers and beer , And I think we 're running a special today . I don 't like meat loaf . That 's funny . How 'd you know it was meat loaf ? I read your mind . Okay . All right . Well , we have a lager that 's really good . You want to try that ? Okay . Where do we go next ? Before we left the city , I read about an island . Fiddler 's neck . It used to be part of the mainland , Before the waters rose . Now it 's just a tiny , forgotten speck . Bankrupt , little government oversight . There 's a ferry that runs there every morning . We stay here overnight , And we head out tomorrow . There you go . Don 't worry about it . Second sip always goes down easier . You 've reached Dash Parker . Please leave a message . Where the hell are you , Dash ? There 's something up With the murder from last night ; there 's no record of it . I checked your search history and I saw that you got An address . Hope you 're not doing anything stupid . Call me back . Metro P.D. ! Lenses . Blood . System , run sequencer . Dash . What the hell ? They took Dash , and then they came here . Who ? I don 't know . I was hoping that you did . They were looking for something . What would anybody want from Dash ? He was following a case ... The murder from last night . I wasn 't with him . You sent him out alone ? I didn 't send him out anywhere ; he went by himself deliberately . And I 'm sure you have nothing to do with the trouble he 's in right now . Did you see anything or not ? I don 't see kidnappings . I 'm not talking about Dash , I 'm talking about the murder . The mugging of the banker . The guy 's name was Nellas . He was stabbed to death . I found a trace of Dash 's blood in his apartment . Did you call anyone from metro about this ? Your lieutenant friend ? No , I wanted to talk to you first . Good . Don 't call anyone . Wait , arthur , what is it ? Do you know something ? Dash found me for a drink last night . He mentioned the mugging . I tried to steer him away from it . Why ? Because I knew who Nellas was and who he worked for . Capital trust . That 's who employed him . That 's not who he worked for . We can 't keep him here forever . What was I supposed to do ? I don 't usually take prisoners . No one lives that long around me . What did Van Zant say ? He said he was on his way . Hey , Cleo . Look who 's awake . Those are the aftereffects of the chloromethane . It hits you like a freight train , But leaves you all twitchy . He was already twitchy . Can somebody just tell me what 's going on ? Why am I here ? You tell us . You came looking for Omri Nellas . What exactly do you know about him ? I told you , Aziz . This guy says Nellas is dead . What makes you think that ? Because I saw it happen . Do I know you ? I don 't think so . If we met , chances are you wouldn 't be alive . That 's good to know . There 's no need to whisper . Where we are , No one can hear you scream . Not that it should stop you . I understand you know what happened to my friend . You have the wrong guy . Yes , Well , that 's how most of these conversations start . What were you doing knocking on Omri Nellas 's door ? He was murdered last night . And you saw this happen ? From a distance . It was a mugging . He was ... stabbed . There was nothing I could do . And why were you at his apartment ? I was paying my respects . I thought she was his wife . Who are you ? I 'm a victim , Dash , Just like you . Someone stole something from me , And now I 'm missing My banker , Omri Nellas , and my money . I want to get it back . Can you help me get it back ? I don 't know how , because I don 't know anything . You know what ? I believe you . It 's just ... They 're a little more cynical . So you 're going to have to convince them . And if you don 't want To be missing anything important ... Fingers , toes , The ability to reproduce ... I think you should tell them What you know . I don 't know anything . That 's not true . You seem to know arthur watson . He 's my brother . Oh , this day just keeps getting better . I 'm telling you to stay here . You 're not our jailer , agatha . They set us free . Yes , to leave , to stay far away . This world is not safe for us . For you , maybe . I 'm doing fine . You want to risk our safety for some girl 's you just met today ? She gave me her number . Her number ? What 's that ? I 'm pretty sure it 's a good thing . You coming ? We don 't have time for this . We have a plan . She smiled at me . What ? I got a head full of horrors , but today someone smiled at me . And I 'm gonna go back there and see if she 'll do it again . Wait . Dash . Relax , brother . You 're all I got . I 'll never let anything happen to you . So you 're telling me The man that has your brother is Luca Van Zant ? Top of the felon food chain ? The one and only . I 'm calling it in . Let 's consider this a minute . Consider what ? One phone call , And I can mobilize a swat team anywhere in D.C. In less than six minutes . First of all , wow , you got me beat ... I can 't do that . Second , police will just make it worse . Arthur , your brother is gonna be murdered , And we don 't know how soon . And the first sign of cops will make him dead faster . We need to do this The smart way ... my way . Vega , he 's my brother . This is my sandbox . I could get him back . First sign of trouble , and I 'm calling Blake . And then you get to answer all of his questions . How does that sound ? What 's the play ? We talk to Van Zant . Where do we find him ? He doesn 't keep an office , but he likes the finer things . Most nights , you can find him at lamarsh 's . I don 't think metro knows this . Precisely why we keep them out of it . I 'll take care of this . I 'm coming with you . No . I have to go alone . Pleasure doing business with you . Come in , mr . Watson . Thank you for seeing me . " This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite . " Is that supposed to mean something ? It 's iago . Act 5 , scene 1 . Studied all the classics . I wondered how long it would take you to end up here . Most people don 't get this close to me . Most people don 't get the chance . You don 't get to where I am by taking chances . No . You get there by being The guy everyone needs something from . That 's how you did it , right ? You seem to know a lot about me . Curiously , I know Little about you . What 's your secret ? Three years ago , No one had ever heard the name of arthur watson , And now you 're the only game in town For clean identities . I 'm in estate planning . And your brother ? Parking enforcement officer ? Is he still alive ? Why wouldn 't he be alive ? People tend not to stay that way around you very long . That 's the other way to get to where I am . You got something I want . Let 's talk business . Last night , I went to bed with $ 50 million tucked away In the one capital trust bank Under the watchful eye of a banker named Omri Nellas . I wake up today to hear that he 's dead And the money he laundered for me is missing . If that 's not enough , Your brother comes sniffing around Nellas 's apartment . Mr. Van Zant , I didn 't take your money . And I 'm supposed to take you on , what , your word ? Where 's Dash ? Locked away Somewhere deep and dark . And he 'll stay that way , like a cask of amontillado , If you don 't return what 's mine . I don 't have what 's yours . We 'll soon find out , won 't we ? I want my brother back alive . Then the tab is due . And the price is $ 50 million . I 'll be waiting . How did Omri Nellas steal millions of dollars If he was murdered last night ? Supernaturally ? Really ? Joking now ? What are we gonna do ? We don 't have that money And we don 't know where they 're keeping Dash . We need to find those thugs That stabbed Nellas . They 're the only lead we have . Arthur ? Yeah , about that , Vega . I , uh ... I got to show you something . My place . These are good . Grim , but good . What do you do , read the obits and then draw them ? That 's twisted . I guess I have murder on the brain . My husband liked to paint . Oh , yeah . Like what ? Roller coasters . The real ones , not that virtual crap They have now . He would drive all over the country To find them . He loved the wooden ones . How long have you and Aziz been together ? Too long , maybe . Since your husband died ? I never said that he died . I took a guess . There was pain in your voice when you talked about him . Aziz knew him , too ? Your husband ? We lived together . A one-bedroom In the sprawl . You slept on a cot in the kitchen . How could you know that ? I know a lot more . I knew who Omri Nellas was Last night when I had the vision of him . You told me that already . But what I didn 't tell you was I had some people I know Pick up the body before the cops put it on the books . Those paramedics ? They were yours ? Technically , andromeda 's . My associate , but yes . Arthur , did you kill Omri Nellas ? No . That crime was random . But I did cover it up long enough To walk into one capital trust this morning with Nellas 's i.D. And liquidate all of his accounts . It was me , Vega . I stole Luca Van Zant 's money . I 'm the reason they took Dash . Hey . Back already ? I thought I 'd try another round Of those , uh , beers . All right , well , they 're coming right up . Who 's your friend ? This is my brother , Dash . Oh , hi . So ... Where are you boys heading in the morning ? Well , don 't look so shocked . Just about everyone here is just passing through . We 're not really sure . Some island ... Fiddler 's something . Fiddler 's neck ? Yeah ? I know it . You know , there are freaks And weirdos out there ; you guys got to be careful . We 'll fit right in . We should go . Maybe you could come up And meet me , or I could come back Here sometime . When you 're finished there ... Boyd , you 're done . Why don 't you head on home ? I 'm not even halfway there . So why don 't you button that top button And take care of the longtime customers And not just those passing through . Don 't mind him . Last farm in the county went fully automated last week . Boyd lost his job . Don 't make me look like some pitiful loser . Yeah . He 's doing a good enough job of that on his own . Excuse me ? I 'm just trying to have a beer . You 're finished with that . Boyd ... Shut up ! Arthur , we should go . I 'm not going anywhere . And you can 't talk to her like that . You 're right . I apologize . Wait , Boyd ! Stop ! Boyd ! What the hell ? That was amazing ! I told you we can take care of ourselves ! Dash ? Are you ... you don 't listen When I talk ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Why are people always hitting me ? Because you give them a reason to . How could you have done this ? It 's what I do . Look , even after Van Zant Found out his money was gone , He would 've been tracking Nellas for months . He would have been chasing a ghost . I was in the clear before ... Really ? You 're gonna blame Dash ? Actually , I was gonna blame you . This is your fault and you know it . So you stole the money . Fine . Let 's just give it back . Can 't do that . It 's all red diamonds in hong kong by now . Is that a metaphor ? Look , it doesn 't matter . It 's not about the money to Van Zant . It 's about his reputation . He 'll kill all of us for just being involved . And I 'll kill you if we don 't get Dash back in one piece . All that talk about How Dash is putting you danger By working with me ? You did this . Not him . He 's my brother , I 'll find him . You have an hour . And then I 'm calling Blake ... I know , I know . You and swat are besties . What are you doing ? Buying time . Who are you ? I 'm someone who pays attention , Cleo . What 's going on ? Nothing . Just getting tired of this psycho . Well , the boss called . His brother is negotiating . Wants to meet in the morning . What 's that for ? Proof of life . All right . We 've got eyes on you . I feel safer already . Looks like his name is malik Aziz . Known associate to Van Zant . Not a nice person . Got any good news ? Where 's the money ? Earning interest . Where 's my brother ? What 's this ? The first installment . Arthur , don 't . You kill him , you kill Dash . You shouldn 't have done that . Next package won 't be a finger . You have until dawn . It was her . The waitress from inside . Are you sure ? Then we have to go back in there . No . No , we shouldn 't . We have to leave . Are you serious ? Saving lives isn 't our job anymore . She 's gonna die ! Because of you . Me ? Because you got involved . It is time to go . It is time to take care of ourselves . You want us just to walk away ? No , I want a future ! For all of us . Then you go live yours . I 'm gonna live mine . No . Haven 't we done enough ? I haven 't . Oh , my god ! Oh , my god ! No . Somebody help ! We need to go . We need to go , now ! It looks small , doesn 't it ? Well , you need the hand for context . It 's , uh ... I know . I 'll put that on ice . I 'm calling Blake . We still don 't know where Dash is . Metro has more resources to find him than you do . You do what you got to do . I 'm gonna see Van Zant . Wait , if you show up there empty-handed , He 'll kill you . You know that . Dash is all that matters now . I 'll buy you as much time as I can . And , Vega , When you see him , Tell him I 'm sorry . And we 're even . What 's that supposed to mean ? He 'll know . Why are you alone ? Where 's Cleo ? I 'm right here . What 's going on ? You said it was An accident . What ? What did you say to her ? Just ... Showing her my art . You said you came home and you found him like that . I told you you looked familiar . Shut the hell up . I remembered that roller coaster . It always stood out . You killed him . You killed my husband . Are you crazy ? You 're gonna believe some ... Crappy drawings From this freak ? Actually , He 's very good . Think this over . He knew . He knew about the painting , About the roller coaster . How could he know that ? How could he ? ! Baby ... Don 't call me that . I want the truth . Did Van Zant order it ? Look , listen , I loved you . I love you . Just put the gun down . Sorry , Aziz . That 's not gonna happen . Cleo , don 't do this . Good-bye , Aziz . Arthur , I hope you 're listening . Dash . Dash sent a message . What do you mean , a message ? I got something , a murder , and Dash was there . Look , I know it sounds crazy , but I think He 's sending us a smoke signal . Malik Aziz ... The guy from the alley ? ... And Cleo Whitcher . I can run the name . You do that . I got to go . Arthur , wait . Just let me see if I can get to Dash first . Too late . I 've got one hit on a Cleo Whitcher . Known address ? An apartment . But there 's a property in her name , Old family business . Potomac sugar company . There 's a warehouse . Send me the address . I 'm calling Blake from the car . Got it . Police ! Nobody move ! Dash . You okay ? He heard me . Hey ! Don 't hurt her . She saved my life . Is he okay ? Where 's arthur ? You 're not carrying , I take it ? Just a lifetime of regret . Sit . You know what that is ? Mezcal . It was popular back before The deserts swallowed up the last agave plants . It 's pretty rare stuff these days . We should have respected this planet when we had the chance . Funny thing , Respect . It 's a hard thing to have And a hard thing to keep in our world . Surprisingly , I found you less obnoxious when you quoted shakespeare . I 've enjoyed your company . It 's a shame to have to kill you . Before you do ... Can I just say , I do respect you . When I came to this city , it was after precrime . Things were a mess . But you cleaned it up . Your way . But all that success went to your head . Got a little cocky . A little too greedy . What 's that supposed to mean ? No honor among thieves . Oh , that 's ripe , coming from you . See , the reason I 'm not going to give you your money back , Mr. Van zant , is because it wasn 't yours to start with . You skimmed it from your partners in the far east . Easy come , easy go . What is this ? It 's called payback . You stole from them . I stole it back . You don 't think they 'll kill you , too ? You 're as dead As I am . Except , after I stole it , I converted it to red diamonds , Which are trading very high right now in hong kong . I was sure to drop them off to these businessmen So they could get back what was theirs . I also took a small brokerage fee . I just couldn 't act until I knew my brother was safe . But now that he is ... " the wheel is come full circle . I am here . " King Lear . Act 5 ... Scene 3 . Good-bye , sir . I want to thank you for walking me Through your hawk-eye program these last few weeks . You have something promising here , lieutenant . Thank you , sir . Henry . One last thing . Detective Vega . Yes ? What about her ? We 've been impressed with her arrest record . It 's not shoplifters either ; it 's some violent criminals . Yeah , she 's really good at what she does . Are you interested in her ? I like the way she problem-solves . Doesn 't go by the book . Tells me that she 's an innovative thinker . That 's one way to put it . You train your people well . Thank you . Should be minimal scarring . Just , uh , keep it wrapped while you 're in the shower . Sorry about ... I 'd shake your hand , but ... Yeah . See you around . Detective . It 's been fun . Let 's never do it again . I 'd like that very much . Kiss good-bye ? How about another right hook ? You didn 't say no . I 'll walk myself out . Thanks , doc . You two could not be more different . Yeah , I guess . I 'm sorry . Maybe if I hadn 't held you back ... I 'll make it up to you . It wouldn 't have made a difference . You don 't know that . I know you feel terrible , arthur . But we 've seen worse . No worries . I 'll be fine .

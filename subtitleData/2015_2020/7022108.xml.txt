 We 're clones . We 're someone 's experiment . They 're killing us off . Bet you could bounce me like a ball . Mira saw you screwing my husband ! - Alison ! - You came into my house and probed my wife . I quit ! Who 's the science now , bitch ? Mr. Pouchino , what about that refund ? - I got refund . - M.K. is dead . - I don 't want to with you ! - Enough ! - I 'm going with Rachel ! - No , that 's enough ! We are going to take such good care of you . Oh , my goodness ! I have stick in belly . - Ah ! Ah ! - Now , where 's Helena ? - Come on ! - Gonna be so good . Hendrix , that was quite the feed . I mean , I 'll have to unbutton here . Was that a cream-cheese frosting ? - I don 't know , is it ? - Oh , you are evil , - Alison Hendrix . - I 'll email you the recipe . No , you will not . Hey ! Haha ! She 's so tough . - Hello . - Hey , Alison , it 's Beth . I told you not to call me anymore . Look . You know ignoring this isn 't gonna make it go away . - OK ? I warned you when we met . - Beth , we look alike , that 's it . This other C-word business , I-I-I don 't even know what to say about it . It 's hokum . OK ? The , uh ... - Alison ? - Uh ... Yeah . Great ! All sold . Raffle tickets sold ! Great ! OK . Bye . You have been phone-fussing all night . Have you got something going on the side ? What ? ! Yes . Yes , sir . Yeah . Ahem ! So , guys , uhhh , Aynsley and I have a little proposition for the two of you . We 've been thinking that it 's time to shake things up a little bit . Oh . I , uh ... Oh ! No . - Oh , my God ! - No , no , no . - No , no ! Not that ! No , no , no ! - OK , what we were thinking was a little ... magic mushrooms . Yeah , no . I can 't . I tried them once , and they went right to my bowels . Ohh , Donnie , come on ! No . Alison and I , we prefer to stick to alcohol poisoning , right ? - Is everything OK there , honey ? - Yeah , yeah . Why don 't we open up a Merlot . Mhm ? You know what ? Let 's do it . Let 's do it . Yes . That is what I 'm talking about , Hendrix . Right here ! Are you sure about this ? She 's in denial . She needs to see another face . Yeah , but you 're basically asking me to , like , drop a bomb in the middle of a Norman Rockwell painting . Yeah . Just get it over with . OK . We need Helena 's location , and you 're going to tell me . So where did she go , Mr. Hendrix ? I already told you , I don 't know . Abandoned you , did she ? Like you abandoned me in the woods ? I didn 't abandon you , Alison . Look , Mister ... ? - Frontenac . - Right . Tell Rachel when you found me , I was looking for Helena . No , tell Rachel that Helena 's not gonna let her suck stem cells out of her babies ! Not exactly a scientist , are you , Mrs. Hendrix . I studied kinesiology . Cosima is a real scientist and a very valuable one . Sarah and Helena are fertile , biologically priceless . - And then there 's you . - I 'm a mother - and a homemaker . - As you go back today to your vapid existence , I want you to consider your worth . Because even M.K. had more value than you . My hand is purple , and it makes the hair all fuzzy . - I 'm seeing tracers . - Why are my socks wet ? OK ... Cold water for everyone . Yeah ? Got ice in it and everything . And I 've got - poison control on speed dial . - Donnie , Donnie , bro , have a beer , take your shirt off . What ? No ! It 's Alison 's - mystery man again . - What ? ! Honey , don 't you think maybe we should be turning that off ? - I have to get the raffle tickets . - Wait-wait-wait . Uhh ... wait , wait , wait , wait . What about the buddy system ? - No , no . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - OK . Alison . Hey . Oh , Christmas . I have neighbours . I ... I know . I 'm sorry . - You 're the other one . - Yeah , I 'm Cosima . Umm , I know . I 'm sorry about this whole ambush thing . It was totally Beth 's idea . She just thought it would be a good idea for you to see - another one of us . - You have a nose ring . Yeah , brilliant observation . - We are so completely different . - I know , which you may find totally freaky , but I find it ... I find it so fascinating ! Like , this is you and I 'm from - " Berkeley . " OK ? - I don 't even know what that means . And like , Beth is a cop . Right ? You know ? But genetically speaking , we 're all ... we 're all family . Who are we really ? Yeah , that 's the existential question , isn 't it ? But what Beth is proposing is that we all get together , hang out all the time . OK , you 're just gonna stay with us . Whoa . Whoa ! No . No . Whoa . We 're gonna talk . We 're gonna talk , talk , talk about it . Dude , are you high ? ' Cause your eyes are like saucers . - I can 't deal with this . - Our ... OK . Alright . Shit . Oh , M.K. I could have done something . Sarah , Sarah , I could have been a decoy or something . Alison , they were watching you too . I think we all just need to lay low today , regroup . That sounds like a pretty good idea to me . Yes . Just go back to my useless life - like I 've been told . - Honey ? Honey ? Kira ? Wanna give me ... Hey . She just ... She needs a bit of space , love . So do you . I will bring her to Dyad . She won 't even tell me what Rachel did to her , and I 'm meant to send her back there . I know it 's not easy , but keep the faith . We 're not without allies . Stay here . Chain yourself to your sister today . Donnie , I 'm not in the mood for the Church Fall Fun Fairl . Not with Nona Walker in charge ! Honey , we are still the entertainment . I am doing my dance , and we are singing our duet , right ? ♪ Ain 't no mountain high enough ♪ ♪ Ain 't no valley ... ♪ OK . Honey , come on . What is the Fall Fun Fair without Team Hendrix ? I can 't stop thinking about M.K. and Cosima out there all alone . Why do I love my sisters so much when they 're ruined my life . Hey , your life isn 't ruined . It 's just waiting for you to come back and sparkle it up . You 're right . You 're right . I made this fair what it is today , and I won 't be sidelined by Nona Walker . - What ... Not what I meant . - Get dressed . Full regalia . I 'll be at the church . Hi ! - Hi . - Let 's put - the drinks on the dessert table . - Right over there ? Oh no , maybe with the side dishes . I 'm sorry , I know it 's heavy . Does that seem good ? Side dishes ? Uh , drinks always on a separate table . That way , you avoid a log jam . - Good . - Alison , you 're early , the Fair doesn 't start for another hour . Well , it might not start at all at this rate . Where are we here ? OK , so let 's just take a big breath , dear . - OK ? - Excuse me ? Well , they said that you might do this , try to undermine me . Who said that ? Well , Eileen and Nina and Nancy and Sta ... Well , everybody . And I said , " No , Alison 's not like that . " So for your sake , let 's just not prove them right , OK ? - OK . - Great ! Maybe next year , Alison . That one goes on the hot-dog table . - Nona . - Alison , you 're still here ? I-I-I wanted to apologize to you . I 've not been myself lately . My family and my reputation , you know . So just feeling a little useless . - Oh , golly ! - You must be parched , you 're working so hard . Have a drink . Oh , it 's very thoughtful of you , thank you ! - No problem . - Alison , welcome . I hope you 're not too dispirited about - the changing of the guard . - N-no . No ! Nonna and I have worked it out . Well , God bless . He sees your deeds big and small . So you can take solace in that . - Mm-hmm . - Ah-ah-ah ! I just realized that I have had this in my car for weeks . The paraffins alone would have killed you . I 'll get you a different one . Aldous was so proud when he published this book , and yet , P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it . And Aldous just dumbed it down . I didn 't know that . Well , the imaging alone shows the foetus had a rapid - and unexplained recovery . - Yes , Helena 's children could prove even more vital than Kira . Donnie Hendrix may be holding back regarding Helena . Well , we have more persuasive leverage , don 't we ? I 'll instruct the detectives . Detective Bell , what 's going on ? You tell me . I am highland dancing later today . Is that breaching my bail conditions ? We have a search warrant . For what ? I , uh , I 've already been charged . This isn 't about drug trafficking , Donnie . It 's about a bunch of dead Portuguese gangsters and one seriously bloody paper cutter . Oh , come on ! This is , uh ... this is a shakedown . Step aside , Braveheart . Alison , what are you doing here ? Uhhh ... I 'm loving my neighbours , Eileen , and try not to judge . And we all miss her . Hi , Chad . Hi , Jake . Hi , Esme . We ... we ... Pff , I haven 't seen you since ... - The funeral , yeah . - Right . Right . I 'm-I 'm so sorry , guys . I ... We miss you on Black Oak Drive . We 're up at Aynsley 's mother 's now . Uhhh , pretty much just focused on taking care of my VIPs here , uh ? Yeah ! We 're gonna go get the hot dogs now . OK . She really was pretty , huh ? - Yeah , yeah . - Do you ever feel like this is somehow our fault ? What are you ... what are you talking about ? It was an accident . She kicked me out of the house because we had an affair . If anyone had been home , they could have saved her . You don 't know that . And we can 't change the past . Yeah . It 's good to see you , Alison . Why do I have this face ? I could have been born with many faces . I could have been a cop or I could have been a scientist , but , uh ... I wound up microwaving mini-pizzas and chauffeuring kids to circus camp . Why this life ? ! Because we 're happy ? You 're so normal . You golf and you watch TV and you ... commute ! Sometimes , you look at me so strangely . It 's like our entire life is a lie . I ... googled " bad mushroom trip " and it said , in a couple of hours , you should be right back to normal , OK ? - OK . - Uh-oh ! - Oh , my God ! - Bad energy in here . - Oh , my God ! - Alison is no bueno right now . Oh ! Oh , sweetie , no . It 's just your senses opening up like a flower . - I don 't feel like a flower . - Oh , sweetie , come outside . Come feel the grass . - It 's so beautiful . - Yeah . Yeah . Be careful with her . I 've said it a hundred times , - " I don 't know where Helena is . " - Anything on here ? Child porn ? Tax evasion ? Pouchy 's client list . No . I have to call my wife . I need that cell phone as well . Are you backing this play ? Donnie ... please . I 'm expected on stage at the Fall Fun Fair . So go , dance with the stars . No law says you have to stick around . Are we cool , Donnie ? Yeah , we 're cool . Just ... keep ' em out of the garage . Do you remember your car accident , Kira ? Yeah . Ms. S said it was a miracle . What if I told you it might not be a miracle at all . Might actually be something in your genes . That 's what Auntie Cosima thinks . Yes , she would . I have a present for you . Another very special creature . - A mouse ! - Mm-hmm ! - Aww ! - This is a spiny mouse . This mouse has the remarkable ability to grow back its own skin and fur . - How ? - That is the mystery . Can I pick him up ? Sure . He 's evolved this way so that , when he 's grasped by a predator , he slides right out of his own skin and escapes . - Oh , come on . - I think it 's rather painless . Everybody says I can 't trust you . Do you ? This is fun . Kira 's already turning her back on me . She thinks Rachel 's gonna teach her who she is , and I 'm just this bitch who just says no . No . Yes . Bum in chair . You are sitting for me . - I 'm not sitting for you . - Yes , you are sitting for me because S benched us . And I know that 's agony for you , but then , let 's do something constructive with that . Why do you insist on painting naked ? It 's my process . And you have no influence on it , so just relax . Eyes forward . - Prfff ! - Great ! Just be natural . Ramone ! - You , you ripped us off ! - Mrs. Hendrix ? Kellerman fronted us those pills and you left us holding the bag ! That 's not true . That product was - bought and paid for . - You ... Aaah ... You are not gonna weasel me this time . - I want my 35 grand . - Oh , just hold on . Would I come here , to your church , if I scammed you ? Just consider the possibility that Kellerman saw you for the rookie you were and took advantage . We got taken . He 's a snake , I should have warned you . I am such a colossal failure at everything . Not to me , Mrs. Hendrix . Can I , uh , help take the edge off ? No . No . Absolutely not . God in heaven , I haven 't had a drink in ages . You know , the woman I was a year ago would not recognize the woman I am today . - Who are you ? - Yeah . Yeah . Now , I 'm the parties-supply guy living in my parents ' basement again . Just promise me you will not end up in Bailey Downs in 10 years wondering what the hell happened to your life . A toke , Mrs. Hendrix ? Eff it . Look at the stars . Some of them are so far away that they 've died before the light even reaches us . Aynsley , do you think this is all there is for us ? Bailey Downs ? You 're laughing at me ? No . No , sweetie . I hear you . Sometimes , I 've fantasized about jumping in my car and just driving away . I mean , who knows what 's out there for me ? Exactly . But , Ali , this is a great neighbourhood . I mean , our lives are filled with joy and kids and barbecues . But if you really feel like there 's some other purpose for you , you should trust that . Whoo ! Whee ! Ah , Mrs. Hendrix ! - Oh , God ! Whoo ! - Alison , what are you doing ? Donnie . Donnie , I 'm so high . - I mean , I 'm so ... - I 'm so high , Donnie . Is that Ramone ? ! - You little shit ! - Mr. Hendrix , I swear I didn 't rip you off . I swear ! No . It was Kellerman with the faraway eyes . - Alison , come here . - Talk to the bouncing hand . Alison , would you please come out here ? ! - Yeah , hurry up ! It 's my turn now ! - OK . Whoa ! Oh ! Wow ! Thank you . Check complete . Ah ! - OK , kids , one at a time . - What is your problem , Donnie ? My problem ? Oh , I don 't know . Just Neo police searching our house . - What ? ! Police ? - Yeah . - Why ? - They 're trying to tie us - to Pouchy . - Ugh ! Well , there 's no evidence tying us to Pouchy , is there ? No , but there are a few bodies buried in our garage . What do you think happens when Rachel discovers that I killed Leekie ? Well , I didn 't shoot him in the face , did I ? No , you only let Aynsley Norris strangle to death . I thought she was my monitor , and that turned out to be you ! Hey , I 'm not proud of what I did ! Enger ! Oh , shit ! Planting evidence ? Whoops ! Is that blood from the Pouchino crime scene ? Yeah . Bloody clothes . You know the Hendrixes didn 't do it , Matty . Hmm ... There 's the irony , I think we both know who did . Helena . I added clone blood in there too . Tie the wife to the crime ... the husband spills Helena 's location . Ah ! That kind of looks like a grave , don 't it ? Yes , ma 'am . I 'm on it . Ugh ! " Alison " ? Allison ? ! It 's Donnie . Donnie , what 's going on ? Oh , a little . I 'm at the church fair . Alison is blottoed , and the cops are searching my house . What ? Uh , is Art there ? Yes , he was . I don 't know if he can , but I told him to keep them out of the garage with its occupants . Oh , shit ! Leekie . And Helena 's dead Castor . Don 't forget about him . - Donnie , are you saying Alison 's relapsed ? - Yes . With her teenage dealer . Balls to S. They need an intervention , we gotta go . Uh , wait there , we 're coming . OK , thank you . Oh yeah . Homework , young lady ? It 's all done . Impressive . What time is Mom coming home ? Soon , I hope . She said she 'd be home by now . I know . You wanna talk about what you and Rachel did today ? No . OK . Why don 't you get ready for bed . OK . Alison ? Hey , Chad . May I , uh , may I sit ? Sure . You used to call me " Hendrix . " Yeah . Yeah , I used to do a lot of things , huh ? Hey , are you OK ? No . There 's something I should have told you about Aynsley 's death . Oh , look , you don 't have to say anything . - It 's fine . - No , you have to hear me . It was my fault . - I 'm responsible , Chad . - No . No , no , no . I shouldn 't have said anything back there . I 'm sorry , that was stupid . You guys had your problems , OK , but those were ... those were best friend problems . But , God , she loved you . She loved you so much . We can 't change what happened ... but if we want to honour Aynsley , we have to move forward . Thank you . I should find Donnie before I miss the performance . Oh , Donnie . Ahhh ... Oh . The weirdest people get one . Oh , God . Oh ! Ugh . Oh ! Donnie ? Donnie ? Oh , God ! - Donnie , wake up . Wake up ! - I don 't even know . I 'm right here . I 'm right here . Wake up . Wake up , Donnie . Get up . - Felix ? - Yes . Just in the nick of time . - What 's he on ? - Half a bottle of Lorazepam . - Holy shit ! - Is he OK ? Yes . He 's fine . Just been dealing with a medical condition . Looks like they 're both alchies . I 'm sorry . I may have my demons , but don 't you dare go after my Donnie ! All right . You know what ? It 's all right . No . I know exactly what you all think of me . But I 'm not just a boozer , I 'm a pill popper too ! That 's right . And half of you bought them from me ! Oh , God . Don 't pretend you 're so innocent . You 're hypocrites ! All of you , hypocrites ! Nona , I see you . You know , I 've given my heart to this community , and I can 't help but feel a little bit hurt that you 're pushing me to decide , but , you know ... I have atoned for my sins . And I have a life that is so much bigger than Bailey Downs . I am part of a sisterhood that you couldn 't even begin to understand . And thank God , you never will . Where are you going ? Going to take a leak . You leave the seat up for me ? - Hey , Art . - What the hell is going on ? We 're so sorry you 're in this position . See ? That 's the problem . I 'm not just looking out - for you anymore . - I know . I know . Look , Rachel can 't know what 's in there . - OK ? You have to stall ' em . - Stall ' em ? Girl , we 're halfway to China over there . Who 's even in there anyway ? Duko ? No . No , no , no . S got rid of that body . Do you think she would bury him in the Hendrix garage ? Then who is it ? Sarah , I have lost my line right now . I need to know . It 's bad , but not for you . OK ? It 's Dr. Leekie . Donnie killed him . Oh ! What about Art , Sarah ? Doesn 't he have some option ? He 's as twisted up as you are , Alison . This is my fault . I 'm the one that shot Dr. Lee ... - Leekie . - Sarah , what 's Rachel gonna do when she discovers decapitated Leekie ? She 's gonna come after all of us . OK , I 'll tell ' em . - Tell them what ? - Where Helena is . You knew all along ? Mm-hmm . She made me swear not to tell anyone but Sarah . Uh , uh , no , no . We 're not giving up where Helena is . - No , of course not . - Well , I 'm sorry . I don 't know how to get us out of this . That 's OK . This is our doing . Rachel should know that . Yeah . - Can you take him home , please ? - Yeah . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna make myself useful for once . Yes ? Alison Hendrix is here . Well done , Mr. Frontenac . Hoohoo ! Found the squishy . Alison Hendrix . At last we meet . Yes , well , I suppose my entire life is filed away here somewhere . It is . Not that I 've paid much attention to it . I know you look down on me , Rachel . You probably wonder why on earth my sisters even bother with me . But I 've been in this fight since the beginning with Beth , even before Sarah , and I 'm in it for the long haul . Well , looks like we 're missing something . Ah ! It was an accident . Dr. Leekie pushed Donnie over the edge , and he didn 't have basic firearm safety . Aldous Leekie is buried in your garage ? Minus the head which was donated to science . For most of my life , I hated Aldous . But I chose not to kill him . The other body , who is it ? A Castor . Tell me Helena 's location , and this all goes away . Even if I knew where she was , I wouldn 't tell you . This isn 't our problem , it 's yours . So go ahead , file murder charges against us . It all leads back to you and your office . Do you really think your new boss would want all that attention on Neolution ? Here . Get them out of my house . Get them out of my house ! - Enger . - It 's Rachel . Something 's come up on my end . I need to know what you found , Detective . Ma 'am , there 's a body here , but , um , we can 't ID it just yet . What , uh , what would you like us to do ? Well , dispose of the bodies discreetly and put the garage back in order . OK . We 'll stand down . Looks like the Hendrixes squirmed out of this one . What would you have me do with you now ? Do whatever you want with me , but leave Helena alone . I should like to put my hands around your neck and squeeze . Then , we 're not so different , you and I. You did it , hon . You went toe to toe with Rachel Duncan and didn 't give up where Helena is hiding . Hey , what 's wrong ? I just ... I feel like I 've been rattling around my own skin for some time , and ... I think I finally popped loose . I need to go away for a while . Oh ! You 're my rock . I 'm not leaving , I 'm just ... I need to see the kids and I , uh ... and see who I am outside of all of this . You mean , - like a yoga retreat ? - No . I don 't know what my destination is . I just need ... - I know this is right . - Yeah . Oh . I know there 's something you want , my highlander . Really ? - You wanna do this ? - Mm-hmm . OK . Uhhh ... - ♪ Ain 't no mountain high ♪ - ♪ Ain 't no valley low ♪ ♪ Ain 't no river wide enough , baby ♪ ♪ If you need me , call me ♪ ♪ No matter where you are ♪ ♪ No matter how far ♪ ♪ Don 't worry , baby ♪ ♪ Just call my name ♪ ♪ I 'll be there ♪ ♪ Don 't have to worry ♪ ♪ ' Cause , baby , there ain 't no mountain high enough ♪ ♪ Ain 't no valley low enough ♪ ♪ Ain 't no river wide enough ♪ ♪ To keep me from getting to you , babe ♪

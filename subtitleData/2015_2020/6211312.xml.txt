Woman # 6 : We have become half-life . [ Screaming ] Max : As the world fell , each of us , in our own way , was broken . It was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else . Girl : [ Echoing ] Hello ? Where are you ? Where are you , Max ? Woman : [ Echoing ] Max . Here they come again . Max rockatansky . Worming their way into the black matter of my brain .

Oh , look at them . So shiny , so chrome . He 's gonna be so grateful . We could ask for anything . I wanna drive the war rig . What are you gonna ask for ? That 's my jacket . [ Chuckles ] Sure . I mean , you can ask for more than a jacket . We 're going to the green place . Wait , it 's you and me . [ Grunts ] We 're going to the green place of many mothers . [ Engine revs ] How does it feel ? It hurts . Out here , everything hurts . You wanna get through this ? Do as I say . Now pick up what you can and run . [ Grunts ] [ Engine sputtering ] [ Engine stops ] [ Grunting ] [ Sighs ] [ Panting ] Kill switches . I set the sequence myself . This rig goes nowhere without me . You can get in . Not without them . So we wait . [ Guitar wailing in distance ] You 're relying on the gratitude of a very bad man . You 've already damaged one of his wives . How grateful do you think he 's gonna be ? You 're sitting on 2,000 horsepower of nitro-boosted war machine . I 'd say you 've got about a five-minute head start . You want that thing off your face ? Let 's go . Uh-uh-uh . [ Engine cranks ] [ Engine turns over ] [ Gears engage ] Of all the legs you had to shoot , that one was attached to his favorite . Smeg ! [ Snapping ] You don 't have to do it just because he tells you . What choice does she have ? Toast : He 's not gonna hurt us . He needs us . Why ? To bargain . Oh , he 'll hurt us , all right . Fragile : Do you think he 's coming to the green place ? Never ! He 's a crazy smeg who eats schlanger ! Ah , stay out of there . Behind you . Huh ? [ Grunts ] The gas town boys . [ Growls ] Don 't damage the good . Furiosa : What do you see ? Splendid : Big rigs . Polecats . Flamers . And there 's the people eater himself . Coming to count the cost . Hm . [ File scratching ] [ Rumbling ] Aah ! We 're dragging something out back . I think it 's the fuel pod . Max : No , no . I 'll go . Filth ! You traited him ! Splendid : No unnecessary killing ! This war boy wants me dead ! We agreed ! He 's kamakrazee ! He 's just a kid at the end of his half-life . No ! I live , I die , I live again ! Hold him ! Tie him up ! Get off him . Throw him out ! The dag : Chuck him out . You got more friends . [ Nux grunting ] Bullet farmer . They 're coming from the bullet farm . Yeah ? It 's over . You can 't defy him . [ Spits ] [ Spits ] Just watch us , mate . He is the one who grabbed the sun . Toast : Look at how slick he 's fooled you , war boy ! He 's a lying old man . By his hand , we 'll be lifted up ! That 's why we have his logo seared on our backs ! " Breeding stock ! " " Battle fodder ! " No , I am awaited ! You 're an old man 's battle fodder ! Killing everyone and everything ! We 're not to blame ! Then who killed the world ? [ Grunts ] I made a deal up ahead . Safe passage . I don 't know if it 's still any good . Get back in the hold ! Keep the hatch open . I need you here . You may have to drive the rig . [ Grunts ] You . You stay . You stay there . Whatever you do , you can 't be seen . I 'm supposed to be alone . That was the deal . Down here . Hey . What 's your name ? What do I call you ? Does it matter ? [ Sighs ] Fine . When I yell " fool , " you drive out of here as fast as you can . This is the sequence ... One . One , two . One . Red , black , go . You have it ? [ Engine shuts off ] It 's all here ! Three thousand gallons of guzzoline , just like you asked ! I 'm gonna unhitch the pod . You drop the rocks . [ Engines revving ] Rock rider chief : You said , " a few vehicles in pursuit . Maybe . " We count three war parties ! Yeah , well , I got unlucky . Let 's do this ! [ Gasps ] [ Gasping ] [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] Fool ! [ Gunfire ] That 's our fuel ! [ Shouts ] Make way for the ripsaw ! [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Engines revving ] Immortan Joe : Once I 'm over , clear the rocks and bring everyone through . Immortan ! Immortan Joe ! I got a war boy ! Says he was on the war rig ! You ! Climb aboard ! Slit : Hey ! Hey ! I got his boot ! I got the blood bag 's boot ! Take me ! I got his boot ! All this for a family squabble . Healthy babies . [ Scoffs ] [ Screams ] [ Panting ] [ Indistinct shouting ] Reload the clip . I-I can 't . Gun ! Give the gun ! It 's not loaded yet ! You ! Now ! We had a deal ! [ Indistinct shouting ] Aah ! Aah ! Rictus ! The wives ! No more flames . Immortan Joe : Splendid ! Splendid ! That 's my child ! My property ! [ Gunshot ] Immorta ... Immortan , if I get on the rig , there 's a way inside . What is your name ? It 's nux . I 'll pike her in the spine . Keep her breathing for ya . No . Put a bullet in her skull , stop the rig , return my treasures to me , and I myself will carry you to the gates of Valhalla . Am I awaited ? You will ride eternal ... Shiny and chrome . Rictus ! Help him aboard ! Ready ? Here we go ! [ Grunts ] [ Scoffs ] Mediocre ! Schlanger ! Aah ! Capable : Look out ! Immortan Joe : Angharad ! Get out ! [ Gasps ] No ! Angharad ! Stop ! Turn the rig around ! Go back for her ! [ Clears throat ] No . Tell him to turn the rig around ! Did you see it ? She went under the wheels . [ Clears throat ] Did you see it ? She went under the wheels . [ Sobs ] We keep moving . No ! We keep moving ! He doesn 't know what he 's talking about ! Whatever happens , we 're going to the green place . The stupid green place . We don 't even know where to find it . [ Machine gun firing ] [ Growls ] [ Groans ] You all right ? On ! On ! [ Groans ] [ Machine gun firing ] [ Engine clanks ] Capable : Cheedo ! The dag : Cheedo , don 't be stupid . Stop ! He 'll forgive us . I know he will . There is no going back ! We were his treasures ! Cheedo ! We were protected . He gave us the high life . What wrong with that ? We are not things . [ Gunshot ] No ! [ Gasps ] Cheedo , we are not things ! We are not things . I don 't want to hear that again ! They were her words ! And now she 's dead ! The dag : Wring your hands . You 're not going back to him . Angharad ! Come on ! Come on ! So , um ... [ Clears throat ] Where is this ... This green place ? It 's a long night 's run , heading east . Hm . We need inventory . I want you to match every gun with its bullets . I 'm gonna go down and do some repairs . We need someone down the back . I 'll go . No . I want you to stay together . I can do it . [ Sobbing ] What are you doing here ? He saw it . He saw it all . My own blood bag driving ' the rig that killed her . Stop doing that . Shh , shh , shh . Stop . Thr ... three times the gates were open to me . What gates ? I was awaited in Valhalla . They were calling my name . I should be walking with the immorta , mcfeasting with the heroes of all time . I 'd say it was your manifest Destiny not to . I thought I was being spared for something great . I got to drive a pursuit vehicle . For a while even Larry and Barry stopped chewing on my windpipe . Who are Larry and Barry ? My mates . Larry and Barry . If they don 't get me , then the night fevers will . Well , we 've only got four for big boy here , so he 's all but useless . But we can squirt off this little pinky a raunchy 29 times . Angharad used to call them antiseed . Plant one and watch something die . [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Guitar thrashing ] [ Thrashing continues ] [ Indistinct shouting ] We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline , 19 canisters of nitro , 12 assault bikes , 7 pursuit vehicles . The deficit mounts . And now , sir , you have us stuck in a quagmire . Organic mechanic : Hey , Joe ! Boss ! Your girly 's breathing her last ! What about the child ? Are ya comin ' , brother ? Wait ! [ Groans ] It 's gone awful quiet in there . Get it out . Get it out ! Come on ! I 've been called to the torture ! Patience ! Oh , you stay here with your grief , daddy . I 'll fetch ' em for ya . Be careful ! Protect the assets ! Just one angry shot ... For furiosa . Hut ! [ Shouts ] Cryin ' shame . [ Chuckles ] Come . Nother month ... Could 've been your viable human . Was it a male ? Your a-one Alpha prime . Hey , rictus ! Rictus : Huh ? You lost a baby brother . Perfect in every way . I had a baby brother ! I had a little baby brother ! And he was perfect ! Perfect in every way ! Come on . Wouldn 't wanna shoot the wives , sir . Just probing . [ Gunshots ] Capable : He wants to help ! Who ? ! The war boy ! Where did he come from ? ! The dag : I thought we threw him off the rig ! T-there 's high ground just beyond that thing . He means the tree . Yeah . Tree ! Leave him to me . Say , anyone notice that bright light ? Encroaching gunfire ? Get out . I-I can do this . I know this machine . Capable : He does . He 's a revhead . You 've got two left . On him . [ Panting ] [ Machine gun firing ] Don 't breathe . Aah ! Toast : Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! War boy ! I 'm gonna use the winch 'round the tree thing ! Take this . Let 's get the engine plates . Max : You drive the rig ! Hold up a flare . I am holding a flare ! Closer . It 's right in front of your eyes ! [ Screams ] [ Engine revs ] Hut ! Hut ! Blood bag ! I am the scales of justice ! Conductor of the choir of death ! Sing , brother koch ! Sing , brothers , sing ! Sing ! Don 't they know they 're shooting at us ? [ Screams ] [ Bullets ricocheting ] [ Echoing ] Gun fever ! [ Grunts ] [ Chuckles ] [ Engine hissing ] I never thought I 'd do something as shine as that . How are the engines ? Very hot and real thirsty . Hey . You need to take the war rig half a click down the track . What if you 're not back by the time the engines have cooled ? Well , you keep moving . [ Machine gun firing in distance ] What do you suppose he 's gonna do ? Retaliate first . Let 's go ! [ Gunfire continues in distance ] [ Explosion ] [ Birds cawing ] Oh . Toast : Are you hurt ? Huh ? You 're bleeding . [ Grunts ] That 's not his blood . [ Liquid pouring ] What is this ? It 's mother 's milk . [ Birds cawing ] It 's okay . Sleep . Get some rest . How do you know this place even exists ? I was born there . So why 'd you leave ? I didn 't . I was taken as a child . Stolen . You done this before ? Many times . Now that I drive a war rig ... This is the best shot I 'll ever have . And them ? They 're looking for hope . What about you ? Redemption . [ Brakes squeal ] Hey , what 's that ? I remember something like that . Woman : Help me ! [ Sobbing ] Help me ! Help me , please ! Uh-oh . Please ! That 's bait . [ Sobbing ] Stay in the rig . Hurry ! Please , hurry ! They 'll be back ! I am one of the vuvalini ! Of the many mothers ! My initiate mother was k.T. Concannon ! I am the daughter of Mary jabassa . My clan was swaddle dog ! [ Whooping ] [ Engines revving ] It 's me . There 's something in the eyes . Perhaps it is jabassa 's child . This is our furiosa . How long has it been ? 7,000 days . Plus the ones I don 't remember . Furiosa . What happened to your mother ? She died . On the third day . From where did you come ? The west . Citadel . Beyond the mountains . The men ... Who are they ? They 're reliable . They helped us get here . Oh . Where did you find such creatures ? So soft . This one has all her teeth . [ Laughs ] Oh ! [ Both laugh ] I can 't wait for them to see it . See ? See what ? Home . The green place . But if you came from the west , you passed it . The crows . The creepy place with all the crows . The soil . We had to get out . We had no water and ... The water was filth . It was poisoned . It was sour . [ Echoing ] And the crows came . [ Echoing ] We couldn 't grow anything . Toast : [ Echoing ] Where are the others ? V-Gillian : [ Echoing ] What others ? The many mothers . We 're the only ones left . [ Screams ] Look . V-melita : That 's what you call a satellite . Toast : Miss giddy told us about those . They used to bounce messages across the earth . Shows . Everyone in the old world had a show . Do you think there 's still somebody out there ? Sending shows ? Who knows ? Those are the plains of silence . Stay right where you are , little Joe . Kind of lost its novelty out here . You having a baby ? Warlord Jr . Gonna be so ugly . It could be a girl . You kill people with that , do ya ? Killed everyone I ever met out here . Headshots , all of ' em . Snap . Right in the medulla . Thought somehow you girls were above all that . Come here . Take a peek . Seeds . These are from home . Heirlooms . The real thing . I plant one every chance I get . Where ? So far , nothing 's took . Earth 's too sour . Ah , so many different kinds . Trees , flowers , fruit . Back then , everyone had their fill . Back then , there was no need to snap anybody . Can I talk to you ? I 've talked with the others . We 're never gonna have a better chance to make it across the salt . If we leave the rig here and load the motorcycles up with as much as we can , we can maybe ride for 160 days . One of those bikes is yours . Fully loaded . You 're more than welcome to come with us . I 'll ... I 'll make my own way . [ Sighs ] You know , hope is a mistake . If you can 't fix what 's broken , you 'll , uh you 'll go insane . [ Girl whispering indistinctly ] [ Echoing ] Where are you , Max ? Where are you ? Help me . Help us . You promised to help us . Come on , pa . Let 's go . All right . This is your way home . We go back ? Mm . Back ? Yeah . I thought you weren 't insane anymore . What are they saying ? He wants to go back from where they came . The citadel . And what 's there to find at the citadel ? Green . Toast : And water . There 's a ridiculous amount of clear water . And a lot of crops . It 's got everything you need , as long as you 're not afraid of heights . Where does the water come from ? He pumps it up from deep in the earth . Calls it aqua cola and claims it all for himself . And because he owns it , he owns all of us . I don 't like him already . It 'll take two weeks to skirt the wall of mountains . Max : No . I suggest we go back the same way we came . Through the canyon . It 's open . We know that . Right ? He brought all his war parties through . So we take the war rig and we charge it right through the middle of them . We can decouple the tanker at the pass . Shut it off behind us . Kaboom ! [ Laughter ] And how exactly do we take the citadel ? Assuming we 're still alive by then ? If we can block the pass , it 'll be easy . All that 's left are his war pups and war boys too sick to fight . Capable : And we 'll be with nux . He 's a war boy . He 'll be bringing us home , bringing back what 's stolen , as he 's meant to . Nux : Yeah . It feels like hope . V-Melissa : I like this plan . We can start again . Just like the old days . Look , it 'll be a hard day . But I guarantee you that 160 days riding ' that way , there 's nothin ' but salt . At least that way , you know , we might be able to ... Together ... Come across some kind of redemption . [ Humming ] [ Insects buzzing ] Lookout : War rig ! That 's the war rig ! That 's them . Why are they going back ? Do they wish to surrender ? They are heading for the canyon . They 're going back to the citadel ! They know it 's undefended ! Bullocks ! [ Engines revving ] Roll up ! Roll up ! [ Guitar thrashing ] Go ! [ Whispering indistinctly ] What are you doing ? Praying . To who ? Anyone that 's listening . Here we go , girls ! That 's mine ! He 'll try to get in front of us , spike our wheels . Don 't blow my engine . I 'm gonna nudge him . Just a little . You filth ! You traitored him ! [ Coughing ] Go . [ Coughing ] [ Screaming ] [ Laughs ] Got to back off . Engine one is gone . Two 's about to blow . Right . Are you a black thumb ? Uh-huh . All right . Engine one now . You and me , fifth wheel . We 'll unhook the tanker . One man , one bullet . I cannot see . Maadi ! Maadi ! I cannot see . Oh ! [ Laughs ] Hey ! Harpoons and plows ! They 're hauling us back ! Leave three bolts . Three . Aah ! Aah ! [ Chain saw buzzes ] [ Gasping ] Hey , you ! [ Echoing ] Are you okay ? [ Coughs ] I think she 's hurt . Hey ! [ Chain saw buzzing ] No ! [ Screams ] Girl : [ Echoing ] Hey . Stay with me . Stay with me . V-gil : Stay with me . Hey . Are you there ? You finish that ! I 'll finish her ! [ Chain saw buzzing ] [ Screams ] [ Beeps ] Valhalla ! Nux : Oi ! [ Grunts ] Aah ! Engine one 's good . For now . Aah ! [ Panting ] [ Screams ] She 's hurt ! She 's hurt real bad ! [ Screams ] [ Drumming , guitar thrashing ] [ Engine sputtering ] You hear that ? We 're gonna see two airborne v-8s . I 'm gonna need you to drive . [ Wheezing ] I 'll get him out of our way . [ Guitar thrashing ] [ Guitar thrashing ] Rictus ! Take me ! [ Guitar thrashing ] Cheedo ! What are you doing ? Aah ! No ! [ Screams ] Big boy ! Aah ! Here ! Here ! [ Gun cocks ] [ Grunts ] Hey ! [ Wheezing ] [ Hisses ] [ Screams ] [ Air hissing ] No ! Remember me ? [ Growls ] [ Screams ] [ Gasps ] [ Spits ] [ Echoing ] He 's dead ! He 's dead . When you 're across safe , I 'll jam the throttle and follow you . V-melito : Come on ! Hurry ! We 're nearly at the pass . [ Gasps ] [ Screaming ] Witness me . Rictus ! [ Wheezing ] Why is she making that noise ? She 's pumping air into her chest cavity . She 's collapsing her lungs one breath at a time . I know . I am so sorry . [ Gasps ] I know . I know . Hold it there . All right . Put that on there . Press it on . Hey . Hey . Home . [ Whispers indistinctly ] Home . N-no . No , no , no . No , no , no , no . She 's exsanguinated . Drained all her blood . Hold these . We need that . Thank you . Needle . Come on ! Take this . Keep her awake . Furiosa . Okay , that 's not retracting . There we go . All right , hold it up . Hold it up . Okay . Sorry . There you go . Okay . There you go . Max . My name is Max . That 's my name . [ Indistinct shouting ] Brake ! [ Whistle blows ] Reveal yourself . [ Crowd murmuring ] He 's got something . [ Crowd murmuring ] It 's immortan Joe . Man : The immortan Joe is dead ! [ Indistinct shouting ] Man : Furiosa ! Man # 2 : Furiosa ! Man # 3 : Furiosa ! Man # 4 : Furiosa ! Man # 5 : Furiosa ! She 's back . [ Crowd chanting " let them up ! " ] [ Gurgling ] War pup : Let 's do it ! Let ' em up . Come on .

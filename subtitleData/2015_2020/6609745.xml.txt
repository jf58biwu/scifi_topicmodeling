 LUCY : Previously on Killjoys . .. Our agents are guided by one principle . One code . The warrant is all . In the name of the RAC , you are locked and served . Well , damn . Double booking a kill warrant ? Someone must really want this poor bastard dead . Are you still having the memory issues ? Then , what do you remember ? I killed them ! MY Squad ! I can 't remember what I did . No , no , no , that 's not what I mean . I mean , why didn 't you tell me ? Don 't you even look at him . If I have to , I can do so much more than just look . Get your things . DUTCH : Why are we here ? Ashyrus tea . A little taste from home . This is the only place I could find it in the Quad . Hint of honey , just the way you loved it When I was 12 . Hmm . You 're in a mood . I will help you one last time , under these conditions . I won 't kill for you . You don 't go near my team . And when we 're done , you will tell me what the hell you 're doing in the Quad . Interesting proposal . First , I 'd need to know you 're still the Yala I trained . Well , bad news , there . Yala died that night , and she 's not coming back , least of all to you . If I could let you go that easily , I would . I hope you know that . That pot is full of Jeren gas . When the lid comes off , it will kill everyone in here . The gentleman in the corner ? He 's a courier . Find the case he 's smuggling before you succumb . If you move quickly , maybe you can save a few of them . UP to you . ( GASPS ) Shit . Poison gas ! Get out ! ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) D 'AVIN : There you are . Johnny 's been looking for ya . What did I miss ? Guessing your night 's been as good as mine . Punching shit relieves stress . ( GRUNTS ) What stress ? Been working with Pawter all day . Trying to work past these stim blockers , figure out who 's been monkeying with my brain . ( GRUNTS ) No luck . Maybe it 's time for a different doctor . Yeah , she 's been working me pretty hard . So I hear . ( PANTING ) So you hear ? Something you want to say ? Nope . You ? Yeah , actually . I want to say thank you . For ? Saving my ass on that ship . That 's two lives I owe you , now . I took that jump for all of us . Fine . Thank you for all of us . You look nice tonight . You look sweaty . JOHN : Dutch . Finally . Where you been ? You know what ? I don 't even care . Lucy , tell them what you just told me . LUCY : incoming security transmission . Top priority . Go ahead . LUCY : RAC team 25-69-8a , you are hereby required to report for a black warrant . Information to follow . Nice . Right ? A what warrant ? ( BEEPS ) Spider got the call . ( LAUGHS ) And the Rygar brothers . ( LAUGHS ) Prinde just wrote , " You suckers better be there . " Owe you for that nutjob on Leith . " Okay , guys , what the hell 's a black warrant ? Competitive warrants , top Killjoys only , best team wins . In other words , grab your shiniest toys and your biggest balls . You 're about to meet the family . Whoo ! ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SINGING ) Come , come , come uninvited Run , run , run till I find you I don 't care which side that you 're fighting Gonna get you gone All right , pirates and ruffians . ( CHEERING ) Let the party begin . ( CHEERING ) Johnny . So I 'm clear , this is an invite-only secret warrant , being held in a bar ? The warrant must have local ties . Hello , hometown advantage . I brought my brother . But be gentle , he is a black-warrant virgin . All right , well , next round 's on the virgin then . Who 's the high money on to win ? FANCY : Well , if it 's not on me , you 're all definitely high . ( CROWD BOOING ) Shut up . See , you make that sound and all I hear is love . Last time I saw you was through crosshairs . Last time I checked , you missed . Twice . Right ? It was twice , wasn 't it ? That 's just embarrassing . ( CHUCKLES ) MAN : Hit the hills , Fancy . ( MAN WHISTLES ) PAWTER : Hey , D 'avin . ( MAN WHOOPS ) Got a sec ? I really don 't think you 're supposed to be here right now . The RAC bought out the bar , not my practice . Speaking of , I cleared my entire schedule for tonight so we could focus on you . Yeah , um , about that ... Look , I know you 're frustrated . I get it . Progress has been slow , but it 's a process . We just need to spend more time working it through . Actually , I think I need to stop treatment for a while . Sorry . Really ? D 'avin Jaqobis is running away again . No . I just think I need to talk to a specialist . You said so yourself , this isn 't normal battle fatigue . I still wanna help . What about the army doctor you 've been looking for ? Dr. Jaegar , yeah . But Johnny tried to track her . The trail dies in Medidas City , so ... Well , that 's good . The Company 's flagship research facility is in Medidas . If Jaegar 's there , I can probably help you find her . How can you find her , if Johnny couldn 't ? I 'm a Qreshi , remember ? I have Company connections in my blood . Just promise if I do this , you give therapy another shot . With me . Deal ? Deal . What if there is no warrant ? What if this is a recruitment call ? You know ? Level Six . ( LAUGHS ) Boom . I just blew your minds . VVhoa , whoa , whoa . I thought there were only five Killjoy levels . There are . Six is an urban legend . Killjoys supposedly snatched up into some special training camp on Arkyn . I 'm telling you , it is a thing . Arkyn is a dead moon and you are an idiot . Man , your soul has no poetry . TURIN : Killjoys ! As most of you are aware , some particularly ambitious individual 's been pulling off a string of robberies on high-end Company haulers . Three seconds of video was captured just before a stolen ship out of Old Town went completely dark . It 's the best the Company 's security can offer . But as always , we can do one better than the Company 's best . Suspect 's name is Joseph Siano . Fifty-two years old , a sniper and an expert survivalist . But we know him better as Big Joe . Once the youngest Killjoy to rank Level Five . Currently the oldest to still have it . ( BEEPING ) Now , the suspect stole something ... Some place you 'd rather be , agent ? The almighty Dutch is too good for a lowly briefing ? Just need some air . This is bullshit . There 's no way Big Joe would ... TURIN : People , that kind of thinking is not going to bring Joe back . There . People died so you could have your shiny new case . Happy ? It 's not the case , it 's what 's inside . Hold still . You gave me your word . Just give it a moment to calibrate . Ahhh ! Ahhh ! ( BREATH ES HEAVILY ) ( GASPING ) What the hell is that ? KHLYEN : A neuro-link . Just a prototype . But if it works , we 'll be able to see and hear each other as if we were in the same room , no matter the distance . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GASPS ) ( BEEPING ) What am I looking at ? The last coordinates of the stolen ship your people are searching for . I believe you have a special fondness for the thief . You know where Big Joe is ? Is he okay ? How the hell do you know about that missing ship ? All the Company and most of the RAC would kill to know what I know is on that ship . Knowing things is how I keep us safe , Yala . I 've left an unmarked craft for you on Dock Nine . Take it to the stolen ship alone . Find the device and bring it back to me . You expect me to work against my own team ? Why would I do that ? I said I 'd stay away from your team if you do as I ask . You 're not breaking our agreement already , are you ? The Company is looking hard or this ship . If they find out the thief 's a Killjoy , that 's bad for all of us . Especially Joe . We find him first , we find him fast . This is your warrant . ALL : The warrant is all . Oh , and , as a little extra incentive , the Killjoy who brings him in gets 10,000 Joy . Have at it . Just level-sixed you , bitch . Once again , that 's totally not a thing ! Dutch ? D 'AVIN : Where the hell would she go ? Should we be worried ? ( BEEPING ) Guess not . " Start without me . " Great , now we 're behind everyone else . Okay , so , you 're the family thief . How do we find a stolen ship ? Oh , hey , hey . I borrowed a few little ships in my youth . I 'm not exactly a high-tech heist expert . Although I do know one . JOHN : We 're looking for a Company ship that went dark . It 's going to take a lot more than cheap wine and questionable cuisine to earn that kind of intel . We had a deal . Deals are made to be broken . So are fingers and necks . ( LAUGHS ) I watched a man get his eyes pulled out through his nose the other day . That 's what they do in here for fun . A trip to the infirmary ? Hmm ... That 's a vacation . That 's a Qresh Finance Center account under your sister 's name . Now I 'm not sure that I would have laundered my savings that way , but hey ... ( CHUCKLES ) You 're a dead man . No , I 'm a creative negotiator who stuck a re-tread virus on your account 's outflow . You see that number there ? The one that keeps dropping ? That 's your nest egg . Cracking . When I get out of here ... You 'll be broke as shit . Unless you tell us how to find that ship . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) ( GASPS ) Well , that was just creepy . We 're going to need to get you a bell . Are you really here ? KHLYEN : Not physically . Our brains are connected by the neuro-link . You 'll get used to it . DUTCH : Doubt it . KHLYEN : So , tell me about this thief . You seem to know him quite well . DUTCH : Big Joe ? He 's not a thief . He 's a Killjoy . He stole something . That makes him a thief . You kill people . That makes you a murderer . That 's true . But what does that make you ? Still working that one out . You know , there 's not a Killjoy who doesn 't owe Big Joe a debt or a drink . He 's not just a friend , he 's a mentor . A mentor ? Hmm . Am I meant to be jealous about that ? Of course not , that would require you to have feelings . You see , I miss this camaraderie . In the last 12 hours , there have been more encrypted messages coming out of Company security than in the last year . What 's on that ship is very valuable to them . Which makes it valuable to us . Ideas what it could be ? Use your differential analysis . Walk me through the options . Like old times . Nice try . Don 't care . One last job and then we 're through . Whatever 's on that ship has nothing to do with me . Hello , gorgeous . Dutch , this is D 'avin . We 're ready to go . Respond . Lucy , check her com . LUCY : Corns have been disengaged . On purpose ? Why would she do that ? Okay , now , we worry . LUCY : Ramp engaging . You doing that ? No . I thought this thing had locks . Trace powder , custom blend , works on every keypad . No matter how much you clean up after yourself , I know where your fingers have been . Now , I just feel dirty . Did Coren tell you how to find Big Joe ? No idea what you 're talking about . I know you were there . I know what Coren does . And I know you left smiling . I may be pretty , but I can do math . Get off my ship , Fancy . You 're filling it with douche bag . Oh , so , you don 't want to know where Dutch is ? Fine with me . D 'AVIN : Johnny ... Wait . What do you know ? She flew out of Dock Nine in an unmarked cruiser two hours ago . Alone . My guess ? She 's off to get Joe herself . Personal history and all . I can respect that . D 'AVIN : You 're an asshole , Fancy . You don 't have respect for anything . What do you want ? FANCY : To win . You know where Joe 's ship is , but he 'll be long gone by the time we 're there . Take me to the site and I 'll use the Bloodhound to do the rest . We split the warrant . No . We 'll do it . What ? Why ? Because he 's right . Dutch and Joe go way back . She 's probably just trying to help him without getting us involved . Which means she 's about to get herself in shit if we don 't stop her . FANCY : We 've got ourselves a road trip , huh , boys ? I call shotgun . ( SIGHS ) Remember . It 's impolite to shoot a guest . DUTCH : This case was the only thing left on the ship . VVhatever 's inside , looks like Big Joe took with him . What 's wrong ? What was in there ? Something the Company would never let you or your Joe walk away with . Find it and bring it to me now . The hell are you getting me caught up in , in this little reunion tour of yours ? Start talking or I start walking . Fine . ( GUNSHOT ) Ah ! Yala ! JOHN : What 's our status , Loose ? LUCY : Five minutes until landing . Docking completed . We got you here . Now you get us to Dutch . I spent the last two hours not punching him . I should have been punching him . I 'm just messing with you , man . This is the Bloodhound . How does it work ? Automated chemoreceptor , built it myself . Just needs something Dutch touched . Underwear , bra ... Pervert . I suppose that 'll do . ( COUGHS AND GASPS ) Slowly . Slowly . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GROANS ) KHLYEN : Your friends always shoot at you ? If he had better aim , you 'd be dead . ( GROANS ) If he wanted me dead ... ( GRUNTING ) I would be . This was just to slow me down . ( GROANS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) He 's going to escape . No . But he 's going to try . Heard you Killjoys had some big meeting here today . Anything the Company should know about ? You still drinking that burner fuel ? What 's Hills drinking ? No . Whatever you 're about to pull , if it 's for D 'avin , there are other ways to scratch that itch . What 's wrong with my sexers ? I treat them all . Conflict of duty . You treat D 'avin , too . What do you call that ? Occupational hazard . And really good sex . I have a soft spot for broken boys . Oh . Because if you fix them , they need you , and if they need you , they 'll stay . Hmm ? Did you just shrink me ? Hmm . Occupational hazard . I forgot that everything on VVesterley has an ugly aftertaste . ( CHUCKLES ) You know what I remember ? When the RAC was just happy being our errand boys . Yeah , well , times change , Hills . Whether we like it or not . Friendly warning , for old times ' sake . Whatever you 're up to here , keep it quiet . There 's only so much I can look away from before I 've gotta kick it upstairs . Mmm . That for me ? Doctor 's orders . D 'AVIN : Why are we stopping ? Did you find something ? Blood . D 'AVIN : It 's from Dutch . Blood , fibers and powder . She 's been shot . Track faster . Hope you 're hungry . I made your favorite . Giving up , old man ? I knew I couldn 't slow you down for long . Sorry about the shoulder . But you 're welcome for me missing the artery . You always could thread the needle . There 's a black warrant on you , Joe . You come to lay hands on me , Dutchie ? ( BOTH LAUGHING ) I missed you , kiddo . ( LAUGHS ) A dozen Killjoys are heading here . I 'm just here for what you stole . But I know if I try to get it , you 'd probably ... Yup . ( GRUNTS ) And then ... ( BIG JOE LAUGHING ) Uh-huh . ( BOTH STRUGGLING ) You 're still a little bit loose on the right side . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) You 're still predictable . ( BIG JOE GROANS ) Old dog , old tricks . I 'm tired of old dogs disappointing me today . Just be one of the good ones . Please . I 'm trying to be . Now , listen to me . For your own good , get out of here . ( GRUNTS ) I don 't want you caught up in this . In what ? This can 't be how you end your career . Legendary Killjoy caught and caged like some kind of animal . How do you think it ends , Dutch ? You think they throw us a parade when they take back our badges ? They don 't . The RAC uses us up and then they toss us aside when they 're done with us . The only reason our beloved brotherhood is interested in my ancient ass at all is because my name 's on a warrant . And because of this . I 'm not working a warrant , Joe . You can leave . I just need this . Well , now , that 's gonna be a problem . Because so do I. INNIS : We said come alone ! What the hell is this ? Who 's she ? I got no idea , Innis . Never seen her before in my life . Well , if you two don 't know each other , then she won 't care if I blow off your head . Three . Two . ( PANTING ) Captured . No doubt because of him . I told you friendship makes you weak . Do you believe me , now ? Shut up . I didn 't say anything . And I told you to run . And I told you I need what you stole . Wish I knew what the hell it was . ( LAUGHS ) Yeah , me , too . What ? You don 't know what it is ? Why did you steal it , you idiot ? I get my kicks targeting the ships with the most security , thumbing my nose at the Company . Most of the time , they come with pretty good cargo , but this time ... Just that one tiny ass little box . But if the Company wants it , it 's got value . What happened to you , Joe ? Life . The Kotlers here are political radicals . True Leithians . I was serving a warrant to one of their sons and they paid me to look the other way . Pretty soon , they just started paying me to steal them things . Guns , mostly . Lots of guns . Look . I 'm sorry I dragged you into this , Dutch . I was a much better man when you knew me . You 're still a better man than some . Lucas . Listen , brother . You 've got to let her go . You 've got to let her go . This is a misunderstanding . If he hurts you , I will take his hands . I apologize , miss . Sometimes , my son has more passion than sense . INNIS : She 's a lying , dirty Westerlyn . Let 's just string her up , her and her pig friend . Your family 's a wee bit racist . My son is a patriot . We believe in a pure Leith . We had an arrangement with Joe . Only , when we come to collect , he 's with another RAC agent and some device nobody seems to be able to identify . So , tell me . What are your people planning ? Is this reconnaissance for a raid ? No , I already told you . What 's this on your neck here ? Don 't ! ( GROANS IN PAIN ) ( COUGHS ) It 's probably recording us . They 're spies . LUCAS : Take Joe . Find out what the hells is going on . BIG JOE : No . Wait , let 's talk ! Trust me , you will talk . You 'll both talk . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( LAUGHS ) Damn . You can hold your Hokk for a Qreshi . ( LAUGHS ) Ah , no offense . None taken . Are you a born Westie ? Yeah , fifth generation . Wow , so , your grandkids are seventh gen . Good for you . ( LAUGHS ) Damn right . They 'll be making the jump to Leith when they open the gates . Got a nice little plot picked out for them there already . The Company 's been good to me in that way . They should be . Can 't be easy for you , putting on that uniform . Policing your own people for them every day . Yeah . But you do what you 've got to do , to take care of your own . The other days , you drink . ( PAWTER AND HILLS LAUGHING ) JOHN : What are we dealing with ? D 'AVIN : Got movement on the perimeter . JOHN : And inside ? FANCY : Two rooms . Your girl 's in the big one . Just her and one other guy . We 're going in and Dutch is coming out . Let 's go . Going in with what , your winning smile ? Look at the flag . True Leithians . So ? Extreme nationalists , hate outsiders . Probably have an arsenal in there . We need an actual plan . You two hang back , take care of the guards . I 'll take the door and grab Dutch . That 's the actual plan . ( GUN POWERS UP ) He gets growly , doesn 't he ? Little bit . Oh ! Access Company database . ELECTRONIC VOICE : Access restricted . Biometric signature required . ( LAUGHS ) Oh , come on ! ( GROANS ) Think , Simms . Think . Time for your physical , soldier . Say " ah . " " Ah . " ( GRUNTS ) ELECTRONIC VOICE : Halimetric sample verified . Access granted . Yes . In your face , technology . Company database . Cross-reference physicians , keyword Jaegar . ELECTRONIC VOICE : Searching . ( HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) ( EXHALES ) LUCAS : Yeah , I wouldn 't bother trying to break free of those . It 's a special fiber . The more you struggle , the tighter it gets . That 's a fun trick . Now , can we get on with the torture ? I 'm not much for small talk . Tell me what you know about the seventh generation accord . ( BIG JOE SCREAMING ) ( FINGER SNAPPING ) Just tell me . I 'm not a local girl . Sorry . Years ago , after enough Westerlyns bitched and mewled about it , the nine families of Qresh made them a deal . If you work on VVesterley for seven generations , stay out of trouble , your descendants can claim land on Leith . Only nobody asked us . I 'm not interested in race politics . This isn 't about race . Racists usually say that . This is about a farm . This farm has been in my family for 10 generations . ( BIG JOE SCREAMING ) After a couple of bad crops , the Farm Bureau decided to come in and steal it from under us and give it to the first seventh-geners who show up with their hands out . Now , there 's a RAC agent here on surveillance . How many more of you are coming ? The RAC doesn 't work like that . We don 't take sides . You don 't know very much about your people , do you ? When war comes to the Quad , who do you think stands to profit most ? So , your brother . He got a thing going with Dutch yet ? That 's none of my business . It will be . Less than 5 % of Killjoy teams are trios . 80 % of those trios fail because somebody 's screwing somebody else . Has it ever occurred to you that if you were even slightly less of a dick , people might actually want to work with you ? Can 't do that . Because ? Every organization needs a designated asshole . That is my gift to the Killjoy collective . The asshole may not be liked , but he will always be necessary . Because he does what 's needed . You first . All right . We 're going non-lethal . ( GROANS ) What the hell are you doing ? Directional dart . My own design . You really are fancy . LUCAS : Innis , bring Joe in here and increase security outside . DUTCH : Leave him . He doesn 't know anything . He 's not talking , but Kristana 's been picking up some chatter . Lot of buzz about stolen Company tech . They 're calling it a weapon . What the hell are you two planning to do ? DUTCH : Don 't be an idiot . Kill a RAC agent and they 'll come for all of you . Well , we 'll find out . Use it on Joe . Ah ! Cut my damn hand on it . I 'm bleeding . LUCAS : Just do it ! No , no , no . Damn it . So much for stealth . Switching to lethal . DUTCH : Wait . ( MEN SCREAMING IN DISTANCE ) ( GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE ) This is it . They 're coming . Everybody take positions , now ! DUTCH : Get a blade . You have to cut them . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Reclamation agent ! Drop it ! Weapons down . I knew more of you were coming . And we 're leaving . Just give me the device . Come and take it . Stop . We don 't even know what it does . ( GASPS ) D 'avin , move ! ( GROANS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) What the hells happened ? LUCAS : mnm ? Kristana ? Whew ! D 'AVIN : Dutch . Let 's move and get this to Johnny . DUTCH : Be right there . ( SIGHS ) ( DEVICE BUZZING ) Let 's make sure that 's not set for round two . What the hell happened ? Why did it skip us ? I think it 's some kind of genetic bomb . Looks like one of them got blood on it . It must have read their DNA and took out the whole family . You could wipe out an entire bloodline with this thing , or target just one person in a crowd . Looks like it missed one . DUTCH : Why not you , Lucas ? I married into the family . The children were my late wife 's . In my heart , I loved each and every one of them like they were my own . This land was for them . What the hell do we do with this thing , Dutch ? Any chance I could still take that go-on-get-out-of-here option ? DUTCH : The black warrant still stands , Joe . They 'll find you . Call ahead to Turin . Tell him we 're coming in hot . All of us . Maybe we can trade the bomb for mercy . ( CROWD CHEERING ) Shut it . Agent Siano . You 're lucky the RAC found you before the Company did . And you , don 't expect applause for doing your damn job . Listen , right now , we 've got bigger problems . The only problem I see is you 're a pain in my ass . HILLS : Funny . I was just about to say the very same thing . I 've got a bitch of a headache , and the Company 's kicked into crisis mode , and Killjoys is the watchword . Now , somebody better tell me what 's going on here . It 's about this . I took it from a Company ship . And this is what it does . What the hell 's the Company up to , Hills ? Why do they need a weapon like this ? With me . Whew ! Still got your brand , Big J. Anything you want is on the house . ( SIGHS ) Killjoys , Company guards . I count maybe 15 . Shitty Odds . We 've gotten out of worse . What do you say ? One more time ? You and me ? I can 't just turn him over to you . Turin , we 've got him dead to rights . We both know what happens to Killjoys in a Company jail . My people will not sign off on that . And when my people hear a RAC agent robbed our ships and exposed a blacklist weapon , they won 't sign off on anything less . Things are already tense between our two sides . Let 's not light that match tonight . Somethings gotta give . TURIN : I did what I could , Joe . The warrant has been upgraded . ( COMMUNICATORS BEEPING ) ( SIGHS ) Level Five warrant ? Joe . Just do it fast . No . Come on . I don 't want to spend my last days as a target . Please . ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) No . Do it , Dutchie . Do it ! No ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( GASPS ) ( DUTCH BREATHING SHAKILY ) The warrant is all . ( CRYING ) Joe would have wanted it that way . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Where 's the device ? I don 't know . Go find it yourself . I 'm done with you . Enough ! You are not the only one with orders , Yala . When you disobey mine , you put us both at risk . ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have put hands on you . lam not a monster , Yala . Everything I do serves a purpose . You asked me why I came to the Quad ? I came for you . And I am not leaving without you . ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) Well , hello there , Hillary . If you 're going to dose me and steal my clearance , do a better job of clearing your tracks . What ? Illenore Pawter Simms , you 're under arrest for information theft and drugging a Company official . All right . You 're not serious . ( GRUNTS ) Okay , let 's not add to the charges . Call off your goons or my family will have your job . Mmm . I have a few highborn Qreshi connections myself . I asked about you . Actually , a little problem . No one back on Qresh gives a shit what happens to you here , so I 'm going to give you one last chance to help yourself . Who 's Dr. Jaegar ? All right . The hard way it is , then . Take her to Westhole . D 'AVIN : I just think we need to give her some time . JOHN : And I think it 's time that I be the designated asshole . We had a deal , Dutch . No more secrets , no more disappearing acts and you 've ... Khlyen found me . We can leave . We can , uh ... We can go off the grid , anywhere you want . Who 's Khlyen ? He was my tutor . At the harem I grew up in . Not entirely sure , now , what he was even training me for . What do you need ? I need this to stop . Which means I need your help . But that will make you both even bigger targets than you already are right now . I still owe you two lives , remember ? Whatever you 're in , we 're in . He 's never hurt me , not in anger . Not until tonight . Something 's wrong . Something about that bomb scares him . Johnny , I need you to figure out a way to track him down with this . I 'm tired of playing defense . We 've belled the beast , and now we 're going after him . And what do we do when we find him ? I 'm gonna kill him . Somehow .

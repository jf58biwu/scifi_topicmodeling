 All clear , krall . I have the abronath . Secure the ship . Krall , the ship is turning back ! Cut its throat . We 're searching for the captain . We searched the wreckage . He must have hidden it elsewhere . All we have is his crew , krall . Let me deal with them . You 've brought us this far . Finish the mission , krall . You will die here ... Just like your father . They will leave you here .

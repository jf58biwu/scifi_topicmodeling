 Ten years ago , the animal population mutated , endangering human life on the planet . Our team managed to cure the animals , but at a terrible cost . In an attempt to return the planet to the animals , a secretive group called the Shepherds released a gas that sterilized all of humanity . And then , lab-made creatures called " hybrids " devastated the West Coast , so a massive barrier was constructed to protect the rest of North America . But new breeds have started to appear , so we reassembled our team . We battle on many fronts , searching for a cure to sterility while racing to stop the hybrids and the rogue Shepherd who created them to end the human race . The fight for mankind 's survival has just begun . Previously on Zoo ... I had a family once . A wife and a son . They died in an explosion . Abe 's the only one alive who knows . Mitch ! Max ? Sorry about that , son . Four hikers were found dead in the Black Forest in Germany . It 's a mystery , one we 'd like you to help us solve . Your baby has HDF . It won 't survive if it doesn 't get a blood transfusion - in the next three days . - What about the tank ? If it 'll save my baby , I 'll do it . Hello , brother . You have something I need . Jackson has a lead on someone who might be Abigail 's partner . It 's a surveillance photo of Mr. Duncan . Let me know when the program 's done with the image . You 're Mr. Duncan . I 'm gonna tell the rest of the team . Mitch . Rise and shine , brother . Abigail . What is this place ? Where are we ? Copenhagen . What ? Why ? You 'll find out soon enough . I dreamed of meeting you so many times . My infamous big brother . But I got to admit , you 're a bit of a disappointment . Well , so is finding out your sister 's a psychopath . Why are you spreading the hybrids ? You wouldn 't understand . Help me understand . You want to end the world . Why ? You know what 's funny ? My father never told me about you . Why is that ? Robert Oz kept many secrets . Especially from his children . You don 't have to do this , Abigail . Whatever your plan is , it 's not too late . Tell me how to stop the hybrids , and I will help you . Oh , Jackson , do you really think I brought you here so that we could have a heart-to-heart ? Brother to sister ? So you could convince me of the error of my ways ? Save my soul ? No . You 're here for one reason : your ability to communicate with the animal kingdom . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Why in the world did you do this ? Will you just keep your voice down and trust me for once . You just stabbed your girlfriend in the neck with my tranquilizer dart . I think I deserve some answers . Well , I deserved a childhood free from chupacabra stakeouts , - but we don 't always get what we want . - Hey ... Hey , hey , hey . We saw the chupacabra in Texarkana . You saw a chupacabra . I 'm pretty sure that was peyote-induced . Hey . Aunt Jamie can 't really hold her liquor . I think it 's time to tell me what 's going on , son . Shh . If the team finds out what I 've done , I will lose everything . I 'll lose Clem , Jamie . Everything . So you 're gonna promise me you 're not gonna tell anybody . Okay ? Okay . For the last ten years , I was not in that tank the whole time . Somebody used me . They were controlling my brain to do ... evil , bad guy stuff . Then why wipe her memory ? And why-why are you dealing with all this alone ? Because I 'm not ready yet . Until I fully understand what 's going on , I can 't risk it . This is Jamie . You telling me you don 't trust her ? There 's more to it than that , Max , okay ? There 's something in my head . A bio-drive . Okay . Then we take care of it immediately . We already tried . - We try again . - Max , it ... No . You 're telling me there 's a thing in your head , this can change you and force you to do terrible things ? Then we take care of it . And I know just how to do it . You may be able to hide from your friends or from the rest of the world , but I know who you really are . What you 're really capable of . With these ? They let me know you 're lying . I 'm telling you , I have no idea what you are talking about . Okay . Then you won 't mind indulging me in this little exercise . After three days without food , a Bengal tiger is hungry enough to eat a man on sight . And their favorite scent is antelope blood . Now that you 've proven my point , shall we begin ? _ You know , I 've seen the pictures , but ... being here , inside the barrier , it 's something else . They said it couldn 't be done . A wall to contain the hybrids that extends the length of North America . Welcome to Barrier Command . Wow . It 's our tax dollars at work . We 're the world 's final defense against the hybrid threat , keeping track of any and all hybrid activity across the globe . Detective . Corporal Lee . You 're not what I pictured from how you 're described in Ms. Campbell 's novel . It 's good to meet you , too . You both will be working on our top priority . The Black Forest , Germany . Where four hikers died from massive hemorrhaging . Trace hybrid DNA found in their lungs . No idea how , no idea why . And that , Detective , is precisely the mystery you will be solving . You 'll find everything you need inside . Welcome aboard . _ This was good . This was never the problem . But we have each other again . So you think everything 's back to normal ? Isaac is back . Reiden is behind us . And we can begin to be a family again . What does that look like to you ? Raising Isaac on the plane ? Homeschooling him in the bar ? Once Jackson gets back with Sam Parker , we 'll be one step closer to solving sterility . And once we do ... we 'll go home . I promise . A new challenger enters the ring ! Hey ! Kenyatta vs. Kenyatta . Say " mercy , " say " mercy . " You have to relent . You have to . Yeah ! Body slam ! Yeah ! Hey . I got to tell you , I do not think this is a great idea . What method did you last attempt ? - Neuro bypass . - Via ? Swine . Wow . You 're not a half-bad scientist . Well , thanks , Dad . Only took me dying and coming back to life for you to give me a little acknowledgement . Well ... you say what you will , but I know my gadgets . - And this is the summoning rod . - Please , no . Stick this in a body of water , it emits electrical pulses . It 's designed to summon underwater beasts . - So , you 're thinking EMP . - Yeah . Which could actually work . Yep . - You got a crystal oscillator in that thing ? - Yeah , of course . Fill this thing with enough juice , you 'll be able to fry that bio-drive , no problemo . Huh ? I can just hard-wire it straight into the plane 's electrical system . Ah , yeah , now we 're talking . - I got a question . - Yeah ? You 've done this before , right ? On a living human ... no . What ? Mom ? It 's okay . I 'll find Jamie . I 'm gonna hit you with a pulse three times . Is this gonna be safe to do with all this turbulence ? Barely safe without turbulence . First pulse is gonna hurt something fierce . Second one could have some unintended side effects . What kind of side effects ? - Very minor . - Care to be more specific ? Doesn 't matter because the third pulse is gonna clear it all up and fry the bio-drive . - Ready ? - As one could be . Ow ! That 's one . Two . - Um , hey . - Yeah ? Um , M-M-Max , I can 't , I ... I can 't see anything . Well , like I said , some minor side effects . You could 've mentioned blindness . Minor blindness . This all goes away with pulse three . Oh , that 's not good . What ? Hey , g ... Pulse three . Where 's pulse three ? Minor speed bump . Max ? Something doesn 't feel right . Mitch ? What 's going on ? Something 's wrong with the main battery unit . Random malfunctions , navigational errors and ... and the power is going out . The plane 's trying to conserve its battery . It 's going into safe mode . Safe mode ? It basically just files in a circle until we fix the problem . And there 's the problem . Okay . It 's probably just some faulty wiring , but give me a hand , will you ? Yeah . That 's an unexpected development . This is gonna sound weird , but do you know what I was doing last night ? You can 't remember ? I think I was with Mitch , but it 's hazy . That 's weird . Honestly , I didn 't see you last night . I was having a family reunion . Oh . What the hell ? Okay , let 's keep moving . How do you control the animals , Jackson ? Tell me how or I 'll kill your friends . Look familiar ? When I was on board , I thought it needed a little je ne sais quoi . What did you do ? Tell me how you control the animals or I will bring your plane and everyone on it crashing down . Access to the main battery unit 's down here . We have a problem . What did you do ? Right now my hybrid is causing irreparable damage to the plane 's electrical system . But that could all stop . Just tell me how you control the animals . I don 't know . You 're lying to me . I do not know . Friends are gonna drop from the sky . I don 't know ! Everyone regroup in the galley . We have a hybrid on the plane . Sure . Why not ? Uh , hey , listen , don 't say anything to anybody about my condition . It 's gonna open up a can of worms . Well , like I always said , honesty is the best policy . You have never once said that . Maybe not out loud . Just don 't say anything to anybody , okay ? Please . Gonna need verbal confirmation here , Max . Okay . Well , we found what 's causing the power drain : a new hybrid wrapped around the main battery unit . Oh , that 's the , uh , that 's the spot when you go down the , uh , spiral staircase and you take a left past the breakfast nook ... It secretes some sort of fluid from its tentacles . Some sea creatures have been known to generate a weak electrical field through the mucus membranes . Must be creating interference with the battery . What about power to Clem 's tank ? We should be good for now . I diverted power from another battery . If there are no more major malfunctions ... And that 's a big if ... We 'll have power for another two hours . Max , you 're gonna have to wait a little longer to get home to Helsinki . In order to regain control of the plane , I need to reboot the entire system , and I can 't do that with this creature wrapped around the battery . There may be another option . We create a weak beacon signal , pinpoint the creature and draw it out into the open . It 's too dangerous . We can 't risk it being loose on the plane . Dariela and I can access the service duct in the vehicle bay and come at it from the rear . We 'll kill the hybrid . You guys reboot the plane . A spinal fluid draw from a live subject would be - the best option . - Abe . Look , I know this is dangerous , but we only have two hybrids left . And since the two previous samples came from deceased hybrids , I 'm worried about the serum 's efficacy . Solving sterility may depend on getting the spinal fluid - while it is still alive . - He 's right . Well , none of this matters if we can 't keep the plane in the air . So , we 'll clear the hybrid using nonlethal means if possible . Someone 's gonna need to stay here and prep the system for reboot . Uh , Max and I will do that . Great . Abe , final step . You need to throw this master switch . It 's in the bar , - behind the control panel . - Okay . And the comms are down , so everyone needs an earpiece . Are you sure you want to be using live ammunition ? Don 't worry , I had the fuselage reinforced . Hey , I can 't remember anything that happened last night . It 's a blank . Oh . Weird . Mitch , look me in the eye . I am looking you in the eye . You know , you know , this-this reminds me of the time that I was in American Samoa over spring break , and that 's real ... Yeah , thanks . Okay , let 's move . If I could tell you what you want , how do I know you wouldn 't just kill them anyway ? You killed a lot of my friends in Portland . That was my vanity taking hold . I wanted to watch you bleed . Then watch me bleed . I 'm right here . Do what you want with me . Just leave them out of it . No , it 's bigger than that now . It 's bigger than just you . I 've spent the last ten years creating new species of hybrids and spreading them across the globe . They 're all just waiting to be awakened . We stopped the apocalypse before . We can do it again . We 'll see . How much longer are we gonna keep up this ruse ? Oh , you call this a ruse ? You were terrible . Well , considering that I just found out my son has an evil alter ego , I think I did pretty good . Can we just skip to the part where you get my eyeballs working again ? So , are the blood vessels constricted ? Mm ... yeah , looks that way . Great . Could take hours for the proper blood flow to return . Well ... just be thankful that your father is at risk of angina . So , yeah ... do carry blood thinners . Dad , what 's going on ? Everything 's going to be okay . We 're just helping Auntie Jamie fix the plane . But I need you to stay here . Once the plane is good as new , Mommy and Daddy will be right back , okay ? Okay . Dad . I miss home . I know . I do , too . So , we get to go back soon ? We 'll talk about it when I get back . Okay ? Okay . - This is all we do . - What ? Danger . Whenever we 're on this plane , all we do is go from danger to more danger . Finally saved Isaac , and I put him right back into it . Come on . You 're just doing the best you can . Am I ? Is this where I want him to grow up ? We 're all just trying to make sure that there 's a world for him to grow up in . What was that ? It 's locked . More malfunctions . Hey ! Hey , grab onto something ! - What ? - Grab onto something ! You can reach it ! This doesn 't make any sense . That was the last sample from the hikers , and it doesn 't match any known hybrids . Which could mean ... we are looking for a brand-new species . Yeah , maybe . But ... what if the reason that they don 't match is because they aren 't actually from a hybrid ? At least , not exactly . I don 't follow . I had this case a few years ago . The killer used botulinum toxin from bacterial spores . Comparing them to the structure of these hybrid traces , I think that our hikers died from inhaling spores . Airborne toxic spores . The big question is still : Where did these spores come from ? What are you doing , Jackson ? You really think it would be so easy ? No . Did you ? Glad to see you still have some fight left in you . Brain frequency ? You want me to wake the tiger . You 're trying to measure the frequency . My ability to control the hybrids is similar to yours . It flows from the emotion centers of the brain . The stronger the emotion , the stronger the signal . But your fear alone wasn 't enough . I need more . I need your rage . I 'll give you nothing . You can try to resist all you want . But by the time we 're through here , you 'll have woken that tiger . You 'll have given me everything I need . Uh-oh . That can 't be good . An open door ? At that altitude ? It 's not working ! Mitch ! Mitch ! Right down the hatch . Here 's some water . That 's it . Abe , get down here ! Abe ! Dariela ! Starting to see some color blobs coming back . Ah . Max Morgan ... Explorer , genius , lover . Take it easy . You just gave me some geriatric medicine . Hey , look , son , I know you 're feeling guilty about what you did to Jamie . Am I ? Yeah . I get it . It 's okay . I mean , how many webs do you think I weaved over my numerous romantic dalliances , huh ? I 'd rather not know the answer to that . Look , the-the point is ... it always catches up to you . No matter how hard it might be , just tell Jamie the truth . You have to bypass the control panel ! Okay . I 'm in . Cut the blue wire ! And then the green wire ! Yeah , yeah , yeah , I know , it 'll be terrible . But after a while , it 'll still be terrible . But a little less . That 's beautiful . Can I cross-stitch that on a pillow ? I 'm serious . Come on , you can 't be worried about what you 've done , only what you 're gonna do . But no matter what you choose ... And I 'm gonna drop the " L " word here ... Oh , that 's really not necessary . I know I haven 't said it in along time , and I need to . Because no matter what you choose , son , I will always ... Oh , wow ! Look at that . Full vision , just came back . A-plus , bang-up job , Max . Yeah . Okay . Put them together ! This isn 't working . Was it the dark green or the light green ? Why are there two greens ? Aircraft Emergency A.I. activated . Greetings , Mitchell Morgan . Is that Logan ? Please don 't tell me Logan is the voice of the A.I. - That 's terrific . - Alert . There 's a critical malfunction in the vehicle bay . Hey , Jamie ? Logan , your narrator , is here , and he 's telling us something 's going on in the vehicle bay ? Jamie ? Ja ... That 's broken . Well , summoning rod 's EMP has a three-foot radius . Must have fried out our earpieces earlier . You know , summoning rods will tend to do that . Abe ! Are you all right ? Great . What 's with the disembodied Logan voice ? It 's weirding me out . You said there was a problem here ? Where were you ? We needed you . I couldn 't hear you because my earpiece was broken , and we were having some ... father , son issues . - Breakthrough . - Anyway . Logan . Explain . It 's the emergency A.I. system . Back when we were together , we thought it would be funny to have him be the voice of it . I disabled it ages ago , but it must 've come back on with all the malfunctions . Hello . I have an unfortunate announcement . Aircraft systems down to only essentials . Engines and avionics only . Engines and avionics ? Clem 's tank . We have to get down there . She could lose power . Mitch , wait . I 'm going down there right now , I 'm taking Clem - out of that tank . - No , you must not . She still needs a blood transfusion from the baby 's father . If you take her out of the tank now , the baby may die . If we do nothing , they both die . Look , we all love Clem , but that baby is the key to humanity 's future . We 're talking about my daughter here , Abe . My son is on this plane , too . But this is bigger than all of us ! Calm down . We just need to figure out what to do . May I suggest using one of the auxiliary generators ? Are we gonna start taking suggestions from DJ Logan now ? Hang on . What auxiliary generator ? If we create an independent power loop , this could actually work . The tank will lose power in five minutes . This might be our only option . Mitch ? You all right ? Your friends are surprisingly resourceful . They 'll find a way to stop you . So will I. You 're surprisingly confident for a man whose only course of action is to give me exactly what I want . Abe , Dariela . Cut the cable directly in front of you . At the exact same moment , Mitch , Max , connect your cables together . 30 seconds until the tank loses power . Can we shut him off , please ? - Everybody ready ? - Yeah . Okay , on three . One , two , three . Power successfully rerouted . Critical power loss imminent . Avionics failure imminent . Engine failure imminent . Critical altitude loss imminent . We need to kill that hybrid now . Jamie , let me modify the beacon signal , draw the hybrid off the battery so you can reboot the system . I know the risks , but we 're out of time . Full engine failure in ten minutes . Okay , you have five . Once the hybrid is off the battery , I 'll reboot the system . Mitch , Max , go to the bar and be ready to throw that switch when I tell you . You had me at " go to the bar . " Warning : there 's a malfunction in the forward reserve tank . - Detecting a fuel leak . - Perfect . We can 't use firearms now . Then how are we supposed to kill it ? We are killing it . Happy birthday , Dariela . Once the system reboot is complete , I 'll give you the signal , and you can throw the master switch . Is that the Duncan image ? Yeah , I 'm trying a new filter since the last one failed . But don 't worry , we 're gonna find him . Look , I ... I know that there 's something going on with you . I don 't know if you 're upset or you 're worried about Clementine or what , but it 's going to be okay . Please don 't worry . Everything is gonna be fine . I got to talk to you about something . Guys , uh , don 't mean to interrupt the love fest , but ... Full engine failure in seven minutes . Okay , get to the master switch . Wait , here , take the earpiece . Ready ? Ready . Okay , Jamie . We 're in position . Abe , Dariela , stand by . Ready . Once I press this , that hybrid will be coming straight for us . I 'm good . Jamie , we 'll let you know as soon as the hybrid 's loose . Fuel leak , loss of altitude . You could give in to your despair , your hatred . Use them . Wake the tiger . Have him tear out my throat . I have nothing to stop you . You could finish me , be the hero . Defeat your villain . If anything happens to them , I swear ... You swear what ? Come on , Jackson . What are you gonna do ? Your friends are gonna die . You don 't know my friends ! No , Jackson , I know your friends all too well . One of them in particular . And he 's not gonna stop me . - He 's gonna help me . - What 'd you do ? Your friend Mitch Morgan has my bio-drive in his head . I 've used it to make him do all sorts of things over the years . He helped me build the beacons , develop the hybrids . You could almost say ... he 's been my partner . You 're lying . I even created a new personality for him . One that can be activated or deactivated with the flick of a switch ... Mr. Duncan . Mitch ... is Mr. Duncan ? You ready to meet him ? Mitch ! Mitch ! - What is it ? - The bio-drive . I think it 's back on . All right , I got you . I 'm right here for you . - You got to fight through this . - I can 't . I can 't fight through it , Dad . You got ... Take this thing out of my head ! Hello ? Hello , old friend . It 's good to finally hear your voice . Abigail ? Can you help me ? Mitch , Mitch , listen to me , okay ? Do not listen to her . Do not listen to a word she tells you , okay ? It 's no use , Jackson . Mitch Morgan is gone . I 'm on a plane , and all the people here , they 're calling me " Mitch . " No , you are Charles Duncan . The people there , whatever they are telling you , it is a lie . All of our plans for the hybrids are finally coming to pass . Mitch , focus on my voice , okay ? This is Jackson . Can you hear me ? The people there , they are trying to stop us . You cannot let that happen . You must make sure that plane goes down . Mitch , no ! Okay , listen to me ! Can you hear me ? And then all of our work will be complete . Do you understand ? I understand . Mitch , no , no , no . Listen-listen to me ! Focus on my voice ! Listen to what I 'm tell ... What the hell did you do to him ? I made him mine . I 'm gonna kill you ! Main battery unit is back online . Okay , Abe , Dariela , the hybrid is off the battery . I 'm starting the reboot . Copy . But there 's still no sign of it . Abe ! Okay , Mitch , I 'm good here . Restart the plane . Mitch ? Mitch , do you copy ? Restart the plane . Mitch ? The master switch is still in the off position . What the hell ? Manual restart required . This is a story you 're all too familiar with , isn 't it , Jackson ? You failing to save the ones you love . What are you talking about ? It was a summer 's day . That clean feeling in the air . The kind you get after a rainfall . A young family pulls into a filling station just outside of Nairobi . Mother , father and son , wrapped in that beautiful yellow blanket . Shut up . So lovingly knit for him by his mother . Stop . And in that moment , everything was perfect . Tragedy makes its own plans . I said stop ! And as that father watched his truck engulfed in flames , his wife and child trapped and burning inside , he was utterly helpless . You were utterly helpless the day you failed Connor . How do you know about my son ? Oh , my God . What happened ? Mitch ! Mitch ! Stop calling me that . Mitch , we need to reboot the plane now . My name is Duncan . Oh , my God . Last night ... that was you . Mitch , Duncan , whatever your name is , move . I need to throw that switch . Losing altitude . Prepare for emergency procedures . I said move . No . After we determined that the hybrid spores were the cause of death , we scanned the area surrounding where the hikers have died . But we didn 't find anything of note . Till we analyzed the wind patterns in the Black Forest around their time of death . From there , we traced the spores to their point of origin . Here . About seven miles southwest of our victims . The spores rode the wind , like the seeds of a dandelion . Exactly . And that 's when we found this . What exactly am I looking at here ? Our dandelions . We believe that this is a hybrid nest . - A nest of hybrids ? - That 's right . And those eggs are the source of the spores . Most likely emitted as some kind of a natural self-defense mechanism . Son of a bitch . And that 's the good news . We cross-referenced our data with local law enforcement worldwide , and we found similar victims . And two more nests . One in Seoul and the other in Atlanta . - Atlanta ? - If those eggs hatch , this facility , the barrier ... None of it 's gonna matter . Who knows how many more nests could be out there ? Send a team to the Black Forest and burn that nest to the ground . You have one duty as a parent that stands above the rest : to protect your child . Stop it . - And you failed . - Shut up . It was you . It was your fault . Your entire family is dead . How are you gonna save your friends , Jackson ? You couldn 't even save your own baby ... That 's enough ! Dariela ! If I don 't throw that switch , we are all gonna die . That 's the idea . Mitch , let go ! - You failed as a father . - Shut up . Shut up . - Shut up . - You let Connor die . Shut up ! You think our father was a madman ? A monster ? He laid down his life for you . His son . Got it ! Behind you ! Abe ! Aircraft will cross the minimum recovery altitude - n 90 seconds . - Isaac . Prepare for emergency landing . Connor burned to death , and you watched it happen ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Your son is dead because of you . Why , thank you , Jackson . When you commanded that tiger to attack , you handed me your secret , the way you control the animals . And with it , the last piece I need to activate the beacons and the hybrids rise . Abigail . What does that mean ? What do you mean , beacons ? Abigail ! Answer me ! Damn it , Mitch , let me go ! Mitch isn 't here anymore . Minimum recovery altitude in 60 seconds . 50 seconds . Mitch , I don 't want to do this ! Damn it , Mitch , you 're gonna get us all killed ! 40 seconds . Minimum recovery altitude in 30 seconds .

 - Clones . - Genetic Identicals . Yeah , we counted nine of us so far . When Beth died , I took her identity . You 're her monitor . You observe her and she killed herself because the man that she loved turned her whole life into a lie . Who the hell is Maggie Chen ? That 's the woman Beth shot . A Neolution gives us the opportunity at self-directed evolution . Wherever you think the science is at , I guarantee you 're wrong . They haven 't just infiltrated LEDA , they run CASTOR too . Both projects . I hate Neolutionists . I assume you have a plan to hide your dear mum . - We might . - Good . Far away . I don 't need to know where . - Hello ? - I saw them . The Cheek Choppers . MK ? - Follow the coordinates . - What ? Remember , don 't trust anyone next to you . Beth ? Who 's that ? No one . What is this ? You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Sorry , tip from a source . What time will I see you later ? Why ? I wanna make you dinner . You 're being a cop in your own bedroom again . Yeah , it 's a problem . But dinner would be nice , yeah . Go easy out there . The call came in the middle of the night ? What kind of anonymous tip brings you all the way out here ? Hell if I know . Think it 's one of your CI 's ? Uh , I didn 't recognize his voice . Did you get any sleep at all ? You look like shit . - Hey . - Hey . - Hey . - Body bag ? Tidy , huh ? Of a brand widely used by mortuary and emergency services . - Shall we open our present ? - Yeah . Okay , well that 's cheeky . Cause of death ... I 'd have to go with exploding cigar . Good , case closed . Huh . - That 's mildly interesting . - Wait a minute , just one ? Yeah . Ink . Thanks , gorgeous . We just wanna know your name . Well , damn . You ever seen one of those before ? Surgically bifurcated penis . - He did that to himself ? - Mmm-hmm . But I don 't see any advantage to that . Perhaps it 's a statement of masculine / feminine duality , Arthur . No , it isn 't . Okay , so our guy 's into body mod , so is that what the cheek 's about ? Well , the cheek 's been rather skillfully removed but I see signs of a struggle . - Hey Janis , can you ... - Yeah . His good side . Got footprints . Two sets coming in . One size small , one size giant . Big one does all the heavy lifting ? The smaller one 's a woman , maybe ? Hey , you 're hungry , right ? How could you tell ? Fung 's ? - See you there . - Yeah . You 're up early . Dude , you need to talk to Alison . Why , What 's going on ? I need to pay my tuition . I 'm changing schools for you guys . If the money 's not in the account today ... I 'm sorry , but your sick German 's gonna have to wait till next semester . Alison will pay , all right ? Don 't worry about that . She wants an expense report . I 'll talk to her , okay ? Yeah , well , can you hurry ? 'Cause I 'm technically homeless and I just split up with my girlfriend . - Everything else okay ? - Not really . You ever heard the one about the lesbian and the U-Haul ? Uh ... Never mind . Forget it . I want answers , Beth . I know there 's a shitload you 're not telling us . I 'll know more soon , all right ? All you need to do is travel safe , okay , Cosima ? - I 'll see you soon . - Yeah , yeah , yeah , whatever . Okay , see ya . Okay . We used to talk through our personal shit all the time . I got cop problems and a shit relationship . Maybe you remember your divorce . Yeah . I remember that you were there for me when I needed you . I don 't need you yet . You just had a rough couple of months . God , what is it that 's got you so twisted up ? Hmm ? Is it just Paul ? It 's my shit . Don 't take it on . Hey . So what 's up with the mutilated face and modified dick ? I 'm sure you 're gonna hazard a guess , Ang . That shit is darkly sexual . You guys always catch the weird ones . It 's mathematically unfair . So how you doin ' , Beth ? I 'm great , Angie , thanks . - Should we go ? - Yeah . She 's shaky , dude . She 's fine . - I 'll catch up with ya . - Yeah . Look , Constable , I only popped round for a drink . The bar at the Highcroft is very classy . All the bartenders in their little matador jackets . You were arrested there for solicitation six months ago , as well . But I was released without charge . Only this time we caught your Bay Street Blow Boy , too . Well , now I 'm confused . Is that a sexual or narcotic reference ? Possession , solicitation , public urination , that 's nice . That was a performance piece , and I never should 've been charged . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Raj ! You 're gonna kill somebody here . Thanks , Beth . Straight up , I need a favor . With this Paul shit I 've been telling you about ... Yeah . Are you gonna break up with him ? I think he 's cheating on me . Oh . Think I could borrow a little surveillance gear on the DL ? Uh , yeah . Thanks , man . So what 's the deal ? Someone dropped this in your lap ? Yeah , anonymous tip to my work cell . I 'm waiting on a trace . Yeah , between the tattoos and the body mods , I 'll have an ID soon . I 'm gonna shake up some sources , see if it 's somebody I know . That cool ? She making her meetings ? Yes . Masks . MK ? - Anybody home ? - In the back . Mika ? Right here . This again ? I thought we were meeting in person this time . - Put the mask on . - I 'm not wearing the stupid mask . Why aren 't you here ? You drove your car . I told you always come on foot . You 're not scared enough . You convinced me my boyfriend 's a spy . Is that not enough for you ? Ooh . You have three minutes . Could you at least take off the mask ? You said face-to-face . There . It 's a nice face . So , tell me about this body . What did you see ? I saw Neolution . So this is the guy , the guy you met online ? I 'm not stupid . I never met him . I just watched . His name was Basspair86 . - So he 's Neolution ? - No . Well , yes , but no . He 's just a tadpole . Neos put their ideas in these stupid tadpoles ' heads so they can experiment on them . Did you tell the others about me ? I never reveal a source . That 's why you brought me into this in the first place , isn 't it ? But you told them what they are ? Yeah , they deserve to know . It puts them in danger . You gotta get it . The only reason I 'm alive is because they think I 'm dead . Neos are everywhere . I tracked one into your bed . I tracked one into the police , it might even be your partner . Art 's not a spy . You know what , screw this . No , Beth , please , please don 't leave . I don 't have many friends . Well , then we need each other . I 'll do the legwork but go back to these " Cheek Choppers : Black female , white male . Where did they kill Basspair86 ? - An ambulance . - An ambulance ? It 's getting harder for them to hide . Their secrets squeeze out through these stupid tadpoles so start at the bottom . Club Neolution . Time 's up . Mika , you ... You can meet us in person . You don 't have to do this alone . Tracked down the tattoos . Our Vic 's name is Edward Capra . Capra , okay . Yeah , I got an address , I got parents to visit . - What do you got ? - An online handle . Mr. Capra might go by Basspair86 . Tell me something , how the hell do you know that ? Uh , I 'm busy out here , all right ? Tell Raj to check the body mod forums . Tell him I said he 's good at that . Can I help you ? Yeah , I 'm looking to have my breasts surgically modified into like corkscrews . Mmm ... Yeah , and , unfortunately , we 're members only . Mmm-hmm . Detective Childs . Oh , yeah . Yes ! And they 're riding nicely on your hips , too . Mmm-hmm . I knew you 'd love this piece . - Olivier Duval . - Yeah , it ? Astrid . There 's a cop upstairs . I 'm busy . What 's his name ? Her name is Childs . Did you guess that I was a cop , too ? Yeah . Implants , magnets . So she implants magnets in fingers ? She implants lots of things in lots of places . Totally out of the blue , does she ever bifurcate dicks ? That 's an alteration , not an implant . Ah , right . I see the distinction . So , are magnets like a Neolution thing ? Attract-repel ? Neolution is just an ethos . Like about creating yourself . Individual evolutionary choice . It 's also kinda cool . Yeah . Totally cool . Do you know a guy named Edward Capra , by any chance ? No . No ? This guy here ? - What happened ? - Well , I 'm homicide , so somebody hastened his demise . Anybody cares about this guy , they should get in contact with me . Congratulations . - Hello ? - I 'm here , Alison . Where are you ? I sent a courier . How do I put bullets in this thing ? You don 't . You wait until I teach you how to use it , okay ? I just wanna blast something right now . Yeah , I know that feeling . - How 's Paul ? - We 're great . No , you 're not . I can hear it in your voice . Ugh , well , we 're fine . Shit . Is this a flower guy ? Yes , I arranged them myself . His name is Ramone . - Ramone ? - Yeah . Delivery from Mrs. Hendrix . Oh , you , uh , must be her sister . - Yeah , we 're related , yeah . - Oh . Here you go . Ah , there 's a card in there . Okay . Good-looking family . Hmm , horny little bastard . These are nice , though . Frosted greens , muted orange . I can 't stand those garish tropicals everyone 's using . I couldn 't spare too many helpers but ... It 's okay . This little bottle 's the other thing ? - Mmm-hmm . - I really hope it 's not yours . God , no . It 's my daughter 's . Please don 't mix it up with anything . I won 't , I won 't . Okay , you repeat after me . I promise that I will not gun up until Beth has shown me basic firearm safety . I promise . And I promise to put Cosima 's tuition and airfare into her account this afternoon . Yes , fine , fine , but you have to administer the funds from now on . I can 't keep running off to the bank at a moment 's notice . - Thanks , Alison . - Toodles . Toodles . Olivier . Olivier , just tell Paul to take her on a holiday . The relationship is disintegrating . Paul has neither influence or insight left . Beth needs a new monitor . - There 's no other candidate in place . - Aldous ... She just walked into my club and I can 't tell if it was a coincidence or not . Well , how could you ? It 's police business . I have other levers . - You do ? - of course . Leave it with me . Is there a problem ? I would say so . One of my subjects seems to have exhumed one of yours . I beg your pardon ? Dr. Leekie . Wow , this is an honor . A detective studying biotechnology . - Yeah , truthfully , I 'm just cramming . - Mmm . You 're wanted , Aldous . So I understand that your followers wear a single white contact lens , is that right ? - I wouldn 't call them " followers : - Right . Well , I have a victim of foul play who was wearing one white contact lens so ... Do you know an Edward Capra ? - No , I 'm sorry . - No ? So this guy had some pretty serious body mod going on . Not exactly this crowd , but your " Freaky Leekies " really ran with the ball , didn 't they ? Neolution is an open-source concept . We embrace the fringes , the fiction to our science . Well , your book inspires them to play God , to tinker on themselves in basement labs . Every scientific discovery in history , including God , began with " tinkering in the basement . " God was a scientific discovery ? A little joke . We 're all impatient for the future . Excuse me . One more thing . Mr. Capra had his cheek cut out , post-mortem . Can you think of any reason for that ? No , that 's horrifying . It certainly is . I 'm Evie Cho . Hello . And , uh , how are you connected ? I 'm not . Alas , we can 't help you , Detective . I 'm so sorry . You must absorb a tremendous amount of pain in your work . - Comes with the territory . - Yes . The paths we choose . That was a LEDA clone , wasn 't it ? You know , I 've never seen one in person . I 'll steer her away . You look after your end , Evie . Please welcome to the stage , Dr. Aldous Leekie . Hey , I got a text . Where 's Art ? Boardroom . Hey , what 's up ? I got called in . I got the trace from your tip . You did ? That 's crazy . I 've been calling all day . The number was activated and used only once . - A burner . - Okay , so ... Could be random , could be someone you know . Either way , you 're off the case . What ? You serious ? - Beth ... - No , no , no , no . That 's bullshit . That 's my case . They called me , Lieutenant . That 's an order . Might ... Can I see you for a second ? - Yeah . - It 's a thing upstairs . Right UP - - See your union rep . - Why ? A piss test . I should 've known . This is the stuff you wanted , right ? Jeez , you really came through for me , man . Hey . Hey , yourself . You look nice . Did you have a good day ? No . Shit . You know , if things are so bad at work , I was thinking I have some weeks banked , you take a leave , and we 'll take a holiday . - A holiday ? - Sure . How about Barbados ? How bout we just lock the door and drink and screw for , like , two months ? No , we 're not gonna solve our problems like that . We 're not gonna solve our problems at all . I can 't breed . Yeah , I made it clear I can live without kids . So did I. I made it clear all I really need is a lover who can look me in the eyes . Can you look at me ? Look at me . Can you see me ? Can you knit me together , or just tear me apart ? Stop it . What are you on ? - Hmm ? - Hmm ? Touch me . Touch me . Come on . You 're supposed to reach inside me . Come on . Kiss me . Kiss me , kiss me , kiss me . Kiss me . Just ... - just ... - Kiss me for real , please ! Stop . Why are you doing this ? Do you realize how paranoid that sounds ? Yes . You 're hollow , Paul . There 's nothing inside . I filled you in with hunches and all I know for sure is you won 't protect me . You 're right . Just tell me what you want . Do you want this to end ? This is all for you . You say it 's over and it 's over . You end it , you coward ! Beth ? I come in peace . Everything all right ? - Hey , Maya . - Hi , Beth . Can I just watch TV with you guys ? That 's it . Just that . That 's all I need . All right , Maya , it 's time for bed . - Dad ... - Come on now . Come give Beth a hug . - Good night . - Good night . Don 't let the bed buddies bite . Let 's go . Hold me there . What is happening with you ? Look at me . See me . Whatever it is , just say it . Beth . Detective Childs . It 's Trina . What ? Sorry , who ? Uh , Trina . Do you remember me ? One second . I 'm sorry , it 's so loud in here . Can you hear me ? Hey , Trina . Hey , uh , we spoke today at Club Neolution . Oh , of course ! Yeah , of course I remember . - What 's up ? - I 'm , uh ... I 'm worried about my boyfriend ... Aaron . He left to go meet these hardcore Neos . Okay , who are they ? I , uh , I dunno . They came here to the club . A black girl and a white guy . I 'm gonna call you from the car , okay ? They 're going to Aaron 's lab . Chinatown is where all the biohackers are . Okay , I 'm close . Why would he let them implant something in his cheek ? They said it was a biometric study . A dentist inserted this tiny little grain , but now ... It 's growing . Okay , well , I 'm gonna make sure he 's all right , ' Kay ? So , I 'm in the tunnel , now where do I go ? Okay , around the corner , you 'll see the building . You have to go up the fire escape to the third floor . 'Kay . I 'm gonna call you back , all right ? I can 't do that any more . I 'm sorry . That 's not what we like to hear . But it 's not up to us . I know I 'm breaking my word . Just please , please just get it out . Okay then , hop up . At least he didn 't try to take it out himself like Mr. Capra . That 's tampering , and it 's well covered in the contract . Go on . Go under . When you wake up , it 'll all be gone . - He had to go . - God damn it . Did you even try to talk him out of it ? He wouldn 't listen to reason . They 're not gonna be happy about any of this . - Can you see ? Do you need more light ? - It 's good . It 's right there . Careful . Lifting it off . - Beth ? - I messed up bad , Art . Margaret Chen ? No idea ? Beth . I shot a civilian . I shot a civilian , Art . They 're gonna take you to IA to be formally interviewed . I don 't know who she is . I don 't know . You saw a gun . No , I didn 't . You saw a gun . Okay ? Do you hear me ? We 'll get your story straight . You can do this . We can do this . Do you hear me ? I 'll get you through this . They 'll take you down now to get your statement . This is Detective Duko . He 's with the union . Don 't you worry , Detective . I 'll be with you the whole time . You sure you weren 't followed ? Yeah , and I ... I ditched the car . Don 't worry . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know where else to go . Tea . I 'll make some iced tea . You were right . Neos are everywhere . Duko 's with the police union . The guy 's supposed to protect me . I 'm screwed . Who do I trust now ? God , no wonder you live like this . Sorry , I didn 't mean ... That came out wrong . MK , what was that thing they pulled out of the kid 's face ? I don 't know . But we 'll find out . How ? I shot somebody ! They 're gonna take away my badge ! You warned me . I should 've ... I should 've never told Cosima or Alison . I dragged my partner into it , too . I just screwed him two different ways . Thirty-five milliliters crystals to 275 milliliters water . Christ , is this my life now ? I can 't even think any more . I 'll think now . I usually think all night . Hello ? Hey , it 's Art . Did I wake you ? Who is it ? Go ... One second . Go to bed , babe , it 's still early . I 'm sorry . I know it 's the middle of the night . Yeah , Art , what 's going on ? Yeah , well , I got no clue . But there 's someone I think you need to talk to . Sarah Manning , my name is MK . I knew Beth . Neolution knows where you are . They 're coming for Kendall Malone . How do you know that ? Listen to me , Sarah , you need to run . Right now . Step back . I 've gotta keep her moving . They all want a piece of me . I need you to tell me Delphine 's alive . It felt like she knew something bad was going to happen . Alison , why are you here ? You haven 't been answering your calls , Mister . This is the point of no return . You 're playing my wife . - Mr. and Mrs. Hendrix ? - Yes ? - Get off ! - Whoa ! Whoa ! Where the hell are you going ? Back to the beginning of all this shit .

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... It was snatched up by this ancient . They called him Alveus . Designed by the Kree to command the Inhuman army for them . Well , this priceless artifact is yours . Just give me the damn crystal . I saw a vision of the future . - What did you see ? - My death . My killer ... it was him . Gideon , your daughter impresses me . She 's a true believer . Daisy , Giyera 's taken control of the plane . We need ... Everyone from our team is on that plane . You put together the Secret Warriors Initiative for a reason . We both know we got to do something . Let 's call them in . 3x17 - " The Team " If there 's some sort of secret afterburner you haven 't kicked in yet , now would be the time . They 're going as fast as they can . We 'll get there . Coulson 's team vanished halfway around the world , and we still have two pickups to make . Fly faster . You have to come up and see the roof . The city glows off the bay . I would really like that . Hello . It 's good to see you again . You look well . Hello . It 's ... - Only ... maybe not tonight . - Really ? _ Gracias . I 'm sorry . Something 's come up . Satellite scans show massive hidden doors ... a hangar buried under the oil fields about 300 feet . What is , uh , Hydra ? Kidnapping Inhumans , global terrorism ... all-around bad dudes . - How 'd they take the plane ? - Don 't know . - What 's the base 's layout ? - Don 't know . How many soldiers ? We don 't ... You don 't know . We don 't have much , but these are friends who 've put their lives on the lines for each of us , right ? But we do have a way in ... service wells that can get us within 50 feet of the base . - And what about the other 50 feet ? - I 'll take care of that . Okay . Uh , when do we land ? _ _ For one reason or another , each of us has been given a gift . Let 's put ' em to good use . I 'm glad you 've arrived . They had our location , so I took the plane . What about the agents ? Did any survive ? I was outnumbered , so I got off as quickly as I could ... sent in a team . Lucio will have them under control soon . - I know I saw them ! - Go , go , go ! - They 're just around the corner ! - Go , go , go ! Go ! - Over this way ! - Around the corner ! Come on , come on ! Coulson ! I saw them go this way ! Around the corner ... Look for anything in here that will mess with those guys . - Simmons ? - May 's bleeding pretty badly . - We need to stop it now . - The hatch won 't hold for long . Fitz , find me something that will keep these guys at bay . Well , I guess we can call this area clear . Split up . Lincoln and I go solo . You guys take the elevator . Find our team , and report back . _ _ Hmm . Four . _ I got eyes on the Zephyr . Entrance is on the north side , sub-level 5 . Crash on that location . Ohh ! I 've got Malick . Catalyst . Careful . Is there cloth ? May needs compression . - On it . The door . - Here . This seal gonna hold ? Hope so . It 's chlorine gas . - And if not , we 'll all go blind . - What ? Guys ... I 'm coming to you . Joey ! I said I 'd come to you . - You okay ? - Yeah . Go , go , go . Ohh ... Ohh ! Lincoln ! Lincoln ! Shoot anything that comes through that door . Hello ? What the hell ? Mack . It 's good to see you again . - You look well . - I 'm doing real good now . - What took you so long ? - Sorry . Had to get the band back together . Got anyone who can fly this thing ? May ! You can 't even walk ! But I can still fly . We lost them again ... and achieved nothing . Not true . Now we have one on the inside . Elevator door open . He comes out . Bullets . Boom , boom , boom ! And soldiers ... " Aaah ! " - This man ! - Hey , I stopped the bullets , - but you dropped ' em down . - No , you guys all did so good . We were asked for a miracle , and we came through . You 're a hell of a team . - You okay ? - Oh . I didn 't feel it . You run fast , things happen , huh ? - Yeah . - You sure you 're all right ? - Yeah . - Hey . Thanks for having my back when I went down . You saved me . Daisy 's right . It was a good day . No , when you grab the head of Hydra , it 's a great day . You think he 'll give us anything ? Well , Coulson 's questioning him now . Soon , you 'll get cleared to go home , but if he talks , we might be on another mission . You had Rosalind Price killed . I haven 't decided what to do about that in the long run , but right now , I need to know ... what is that thing parading around as Grant Ward ? You ever ride Arabians ? I 'm not really the equestrian type . Magnificent horses , hard to control . Stephanie rode Arabians ... my daughter . We were riding once in the Tetons , and there was this rockslide up ahead , and her horse bucked ... threw her right off . And my heart stopped . But she got up and ... calmed that horse in a way that made me more proud than anything I 'd ever done . And that was the day I told her about Hydra . - Brought her into the fold . - Where 's Stephanie now , Gideon ? I was foolish . I thought that I could bring back the Hydra and guide it the same way Stephanie commanded that horse . I taught her to have faith in it as a god . And she did . - If you ever want to see her again ... - He killed her ! It cares nothing for us . Doesn 't sound like a god . Oh , no , Mr. Coulson . It is a god ... it 's just not ours . - What are you doing ? - Just checking it out . You really think it belonged to that Alveus guy ? It 's so old . I don 't know , but we better check it in along with the Terrigen . You 're still upset I took that crystal to James ' shack . Yes , I am . You should have told me . I thought , if you didn 't know , you couldn 't be blamed . - And if something went wrong ? - I know . I 'm sorry . Can 't be easy having your boyfriend on the team . Not when you take advantage of that relationship . I thought you 'd understand the move . It was a good play . Just tell me next time . You should check in on Joey . I think killing Lucio has him pretty shaken . - I completely missed it . - They did good today , but there 's a lot to get used to at S.H.I.E.L.D. _ _ I have a new name , too . They all call me " Yo-Yo . " Your fault . _ I will get my revenge . And your Spanish is much better , not just " pescado . " Yeah . It 's a new S.H.I.E.L.D. requirement . I know you think S.H.I.E.L.D. is dangerous , but , really , our mission is to protect . Um ... _ _ - Doesn 't kill ... - And these ? Those kill . You do your best , but ... some days are tougher than others . It 's okay , Mack . I trust you . What on earth are you doing ? Well , you 're the doctor . Is he dead or not ? His body temperature is 98 degrees . Dead-ish . There 's some sort of metabolic activity . Fascinating . - No , not fascinating . Quarantine . - Quarantine . Excuse us . Nothing to worry about . There is a reckoning coming . You put your faith in the Inhumans like I did . It is a deadly mistake . - They will all worship him . - He 's not a god . As far as we know , he was a slave to the Kree . What better beginning for a god ? They called him " Alveus . " Do you know that word ? It 's Latin . It means " Hive , " which is fitting , because he 's a parasite ... swarms , eats , moves from corpse to corpse . Well , that 's one way to see it . You 're not really a religious man , are you ? - I have faith in my team . - That 's what he 'll destroy first . You said they 'll worship him . What did you mean ? I 'm saying that those that were loyal to me now serve him . He infected them , became a part of them , and they instantly joined the hive . Mind control ? You 're the head of Hydra . Why would I ever believe you ? You don 't have to believe . You 'll see soon enough . You sent four Inhumans into his lair , and now they 're in your base . How many of them do you think he turned ? If you trust any of them , stop now . Is everything okay ? I need you to quietly lock down the base . - Malick has no proof . - I have to take this threat seriously . Well , then , let 's get ahead of it . - We can ... talk to them , scan them . - We have no way to test for this . If any of them are sick , they could be very dangerous . They need to be in containment now . And then what ? Simmons said it ... there 's no test . Are we gonna question them ? What do we ask ... " Are you infected ? No ? Great . Thanks . " None of this works if they know we know . I need more . Lucio 's body had some abnormal readings . Maybe we could start there . It could help us confirm whether Malick 's full of it . Get me proof . If this is real , any one of them could have been turned or all of them . I need a test and then a cure . - That 's a hell of a gamble . - It 's our best shot . We keep everyone contained to the base . If anyone 's infected , they came for a reason . We monitor them , let them show their hand . They saved our lives , and now we can 't trust the lot of them . S-Sorry . I came when I saw the base was on lockdown . What 's up ? It 's a security precaution while Malick 's in custody . Right . Did we get any info on Zombie-Ward ? Not yet , but I 'm confident we will . Good . If we get intel , let me know . I 'd like my team to get another shot at him . Um , but , you should know Joey crossed off Lucio . I 'm not sure he was ready for that already ... to be back in the field after it . That 's hard . I 'll check in on him . Thanks . Get me answers . What do you mean ? I 'm not leave ? This is common . It 's just a security thing since Malick 's here . Security ? _ I want to do something , or I go home . Have they cracked him yet ? He 's cooperating , but we have to be patient . We 'll get our chance . _ Have you talked to Joey yet ? I 've tried . I can 't find him anywhere . - Time for your pain meds . - I don 't want that . Trust me ... in an hour , you will . Those knock me out . May , he 's trying to help you . Just give me a minute with her . - Meet me in my room ? - Yeah . How are you doing , really ? I 'm in a lot of pain , and I hate this hospital gown . Mm . You think ? You did good today . You led them well . - Does it ever get any easier ? - Only harder . Why ? I think Coulson 's having me lie to them about the base lockdown . They can feel it . - Sometimes , that 's the job . - Doesn 't feel right . If he 's withholding , I 'm sure it 's for the right reasons . I got to ask ... you wanted all of this . What did you think would happen ? You don 't understand what it 's like to be brought up in faith . We were " C and E " Catholics . Sure , it 's no death cult . Then you know we all have our sins . I believed that I could resurrect a god . - But instead , I freed the Devil . - Only technically . I mean , all the ancient Satanic creation myths ... they were based on him , which you knew . The Devil promises everything and then lets you destroy your own world . I sacrificed my brother to him . Still , he took my daughter . And that image ... of her body lying on that floor ... I failed her . W-What else matters ? What you do next matters . Are you trying to sell me on the idea that I can set everything right ? I 'm trying to sell you on revenge . I have an image , too , of a body on the floor ... Rosalind Price . Love turned to rage in that moment . So I hunted down and murdered Grant Ward . Not to serve any good . Not to serve any belief . I wanted revenge . I wanted to feel him die . That 's the sin that gave your Devil new life . To come and take everything we love . Let it turn into rage . Tell me how to stop him . - This god has outlived ... - I 've met gods . Gods bleed . I never saw my last rodeo being with S.H.I.E.L.D. What would you like to know ? Start with everything . No . You can 't ask me to do that again . Trust me , Joey . We 'll figure this out . Now I 'm just seeing things . Mnh . Whatever the hell is going on , the Inhumans are wondering about it . Also ... what the hell is going on , Mack ? Too damned much . Subject was 36 , male , Colombian . Cause of death ... exsanguination due to stab wound . Toxicology and blood work have shown normal levels . Though the body maintained a temperature of 98 degrees , which is very bizarre . Simmons will try and make this sound science-y , but for the record , we 're about to split open this guy 's head . Fitz doesn 't approve of voice notes . Ohh . So , um , you seen any movies lately ? You 're asking me to one ? - What 's wrong ? - I just want an hour without imagining that half our teammates are gonna kill us . Joey offed this guy . Picture the hell Yo-Yo could raise ... or Daisy . Lincoln could electrocute us in our sleep . Or any time , really . I see your point . How do we land in these situations ? We 're S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . Today could be worse . - We 're in hazmat suits . - Yeah . To help our friends . They 're lucky to have you . Ohh . Fitz . Why are you calling me out of an interrogation ? And what the hell are you doing out of bed ? Fitz-Simmons are on their way . They confirmed Lucio 's infection . - Malick wasn 't lying . - I so badly hoped he was . The parasites infest deep in the brain , but the good news is it doesn 't seem to cause permanent damage . But they don 't have a test ... not yet . Surveillance isn 't working . They 're all over the base . It 's a threat . We need to quarantine them . I don 't know how - to convince them , but ... - Telling them is too dangerous . We have to ice them . I 'll explain when they 're safe . Anything suspicious on the cameras ? Everyone looks suspicious if you stare at them long enough . I mean , Joey 's a ghost , arguing with Lincoln . And I think Yo-Yo scoped out every angle of this base . Lincoln tried to pump me full of meds before I talked to Daisy . Yeah , but he is a doctor . What did Daisy say ? She felt like you were lying to her . What game are we playing ? I think we 're about to find out . No . Somebody sabotaged the power . Good luck he skipped ... the perimeter security is on the emergency generator . - Fitz . - The security cam is on . Is that Malick 's room ? Ohh . Are you all right ? What happened ? You okay ? Malick 's door was open . He was already dead . Then a bloody grenade went off right in front of us . Covering up the cause of death . - Can you walk ? - Yeah . Okay . Come with me . Okay . Mack and May are gathering teams to quarantine the Inhumans . Get yourselves patched up , and find a place to lay low for a while . - What happened ? Are you okay ? - We 're fine . She said she 's fine . - I 'm trying to help . - What was that blast ? Go into the common area . I 'll brief everyone there in a few moments . Are we in danger ? What the hell ? Go into the common area . That 's an order . You 've kept us in the dark all day . There 's a situation , Daisy . I need you to get your team to cooperate . - Were we attacked ? - Everything will be all right . I just need you to stay right where you are . _ May ... be cool . - Where 's Joey ? - I don 't know . Coulson , you need to level with me right now . We need to get you checked out . Hive can sway Inhumans . Your team may have been exposed in the rescue . Wait . Sway ... like mind control ? One of you killed Malick . I 'm trying to keep everyone safe , including you . - Where 's Joey ? - My team wouldn 't do that . They wouldn 't have a choice . It 's like an infection . _ I swear that 's what I 'm doing , Yo-Yo . - We saved your asses , and you come at us ? - Lincoln . - Why didn 't you tell us ? - Daisy , stand down . First , we get everyone in quarantine , and then we can talk . Not everyone . Anybody in here could have killed Malick , - but you singled us out right away ! - Lincoln , stop it ! What 's happening ? - Where the hell have you been ? - If we don 't get these doors blocked , - nobody 's questions get answered ! - Got it ! Okay . Someone explain what 's going on . _ Malick 's dead . They suspect us . Well , why would they think that ? They think Hive infected one of us while we were in that base . - Messed with our heads . - Where were you ? - What ? - Where were you , Joey ? The base went dark . I was looking for you . - Infected ? - That glass not gonna keep them out . Right . How do we fix this ? We stay calm , and we stick together . Why are they sure it 's one of us ? Malick ... whatever he said to Coulson has him spooked . But he could be wrong . I mean , they 're taking his word for it ? _ - What ? - What ? Screw S.H.I.E.L.D. Jiaying was terrified of Hive returning . Now I can see why . You know Fitz-Simmons quarantined Lucio 's body ? Why didn 't they tell us sooner ? If that 's true , this is exactly why Coulson didn 't say anything . - Anybody has ... - And if that is true , I don 't want you telling me what to think ... any of you . We were all alone in that base . Any of you could be infected . Any one of us . That includes you . They 're ready to go . Or we can pump in sleeping gas if you give me 10 . Contain for now . If they 're arguing , that means they 're not all turned . Search their bunks and lockers . Figure out what we 're missing here . Hopefully , someone in there is doing the same thing . I saw it , Yo-Yo . That 's not a bullet wound , so how 'd you get it ? I fight 10 people . Accident . _ _ _ What are you saying ? Could you please speak English right now ? _ Hey , look . It 's not important , okay ? I don 't care which one of you did this . I just want to leave , one way or another . Are you saying you 'll fight S.H.I.E.L.D. to get out of here ? - Because that means me , too . - They 're about to break in . I am not going back into isolation . - Why not ? Alone all day , no ? - I just needed some time , okay ? Joey , you were completely AWOL when Malick was killed . - That 's not okay . - I don 't care about Malick ! You were the one gunning for him , and now he 's dead . - That 's not on me . - Gunning for intel , not to kill him . - He 's the head of Hydra . - But it 's a fair point . Excuse me ? I wanted to get to Malick to finish off Ward or ... or Hive or whatever . Friends died . You know that . Where were you when the lights went out ? I was in my room where I told you to meet me . Where were you , sparky , during the electrical failure ? Sorry . We 're supposed to be a team . This team is sick . How do we know whoever turned can 't infect the rest ? There 's no evidence of that . I just want out , with or without your help . Hey , hey , hey ! Suddenly , you 're willing to fight your way out ? - Me , too . I don 't trust anyone . - No one leaves . _ We need to get out of here . Hey ! He 's right ! He 's right . We should get somewhere safe ... - figure this out on our own terms . - What ? We can 't leave and let an infected person escape ! It 's better than someone in here or out there getting killed . Okay . Coulson has a hidden elevator . It used to be an old underground exit . Maybe I can break through to get out . It 's the only way we all live today . - Okay . Let 's go . - Come on . Do we even know what we 're supposed to be looking for ? We do now . No , no . This way . It 's not much farther . The original passage is hidden through here . I hope you 're sure about this . Hi . - You sold us out ! - Liar ! I 'm sorry . If someone 's infected , I had to make this call . I mean no harm . We 're all a part of the same team , but one of us is sick . I didn 't say anything earlier because we didn 't know who it was , but now we do . Let me guess ... when you decided to leave , Lincoln didn 't want to go . Not without his prize . This was taken from the Assets room - and hidden in your locker . - I didn 't do that . Daisy , you have to believe me . You know how to get in there . You 've stolen from that room before . - Yeah . That was different . - No . That was exactly the same . From the moment Hive popped up on our radar , you suddenly knew where to find this and had your hands on it until our distress call diverted you to Malick 's base . Exactly . That was before any of this could have been exposed to Hive ! - Was it ? - Transia . The rooftop . Daisy fought Malick . I found the bodies . But you said you caught a glimpse of Ward , didn 't you ? So you 're saying he wasn 't turned last night ? No . He 's been turned this whole time . I wasn 't anywhere close to Hive ! We can fix this , Lincoln . Let us help you . Leave me alone ! Lincoln ! We were good together . And yet , it took so little to split our team apart . - I failed them . - This is being a leader . You want to protect everyone , but you can 't . People get hurt . - Today wasn 't your fault . - Doesn 't feel that way . We were attacked by something very smart and very dangerous . Hive destroyed the most sacred thing for a team ... - Yo-Yo ... - My name is Elena . ... trust . When will the results come in ? - Soon . - Good . Because I think I don 't want to be here anymore . I know you want to destroy Hive for what he 's done to you . We all do , and we will . I know you want revenge , but we have to be better . We have to do what 's best for the team . It 's times like this when there 's no clear path that ... I understand why people pray . We don 't know if any of the rest of you are infected , but we will soon . Even so , the Inhumans cannot encounter Hive . For the time being , I have to keep you in quarantine . I have to disband your team , Daisy . I 'm sorry . We 'll be stronger next time . You 'll see . - Temperature differential ? - Too similar . Brain biopsy ? Too lethal . Dopamine levels ? You think it drugs them ? I have no idea how to help them . We should be in the lab . Well , we 're running every test that we can . One of these days , we 'll find something out in space that 's magnificent , right ? Not trying to infect us or kill us like Hive . What 's Hive ? Couldn 't even get off a desert planet without us , so we 'll sort him out . I just want to help our friends . I know . Sorry . Uh ... sorry . I know everything with Will and ... starting over . - I didn 't mean to push too fast . - Too fast ? Fitz , it 's been 10 years . - We can 't waste any more time . - Really ? - ' Cause I thought that ... - Really . And since we 're cursed or whatever nonsense ... - Oh , I said that one time . - Well , and you and your fourth-dimension idea ... - And for the record , actually ... - ... that we can 't change fate . ... today is more evidence that the cosmos is against us . I 'm tired of seeing our friends ripped apart from each other . That can 't happen to us again . I won 't let it . Then we won 't let it . Who needs space ? Because I 've got something magnificent right here . A picture of space . One of my prized possessions , that is . I don 't know why it makes ... - Okay . - any significance to ... Mm-hmm . I had to see you . Daisy ... I didn 't do anything . I-I promise . I did not betray the team . I believe you . I believe you . That 's why I came ... I came to get you out of here . What ? Are you serious ? We could just walk right out of here . Uh ... They wouldn 't understand . I don 't care . We can be together . We can 't just throw S.H.I.E.L.D. away . They 'll find a test and see that I 'm innocent . How did you get out of your cell ? I 'm the one who programmed the security features . Lincoln , S.H.I.E.L.D. can 't hold us . But we want them to , right ? Daisy ... what did you do ? I 've got Malick . I have to get back to the base . - They have something we need . - Do it . Guys , I 'm coming to you . So ... this is what Hive 's sway looks like . Daisy , he 's using you ! - You 're ... You 're sick . - No . I 'm happier than I 've ever been . You get it . You 've felt an emptiness your entire life , like me . We 've tried to fill it , but it never works . I found the answer ... and it 's beautiful . It 's ... It 's ... It 's a bond . Beautiful ? - Daisy , people are dying ! - Malick ? So it 's you . I was curious who Hive would send . I know what you 're gonna do . We can 't let you keep talking . And I won 't be kept from my daughter . If I 'm honest , I might enjoy this . Malick doesn 't matter . He could only hurt us . - What we are trying to build ... - Do I matter that little to you ? ! No , I care about you ! I ... The Daisy I know wouldn 't betray S.H.I.E.L.D. , wouldn 't throw away what we have ! - Y-You framed me . - I 'm sorry . But Coulson had to find his rat so S.H.I.E.L.D. could stand down . And you have trouble keeping your temper . - Really ? - But I 'm not throwing you away . You ... You ... You used that ... against me ? ! I 'm here for you now ! We care about you . We could have all of it ... together . No . I don 't want any part of this . You 'll understand someday . Daisy ! We 'll return in a moment . Preparations have been made to leave . We need somewhere safe . With what we did to his daughter , I worry Malick will turn on Hydra . That won 't be a problem . Gideon is dead . Hydra 's evolved . In that case , there is the issue of his estate . I 'm aware of his wealth and not concerned . We find Skye next . I believe I know where she 's headed . Of course . But there is a considerable portion available to move now . - How much ? - Roughly $ 960 ... million . Hmm . Malick built something very impressive with his life . Let 's spend it .

 ( DOOR SHUTS ) ( GROANS ) ( PANTS ) I knew it was you . I 'm not Golding . - You 're lying . - I promise you I 'm not . But that doesn 't mean we don 't work together . I 'm not the one who 's done this to you . - Then let me go . - I can 't do that . But I won 't hurt you . After all we 're family . - I 'm not your family . - Didn 't she tell you ? Your mother and my father were lovers . - No . - Some 34 years ago . It 's bullshit ! I found this case of photographs after my father died . Have a look . Believe me , Eve , no one wants any harm done to you . You 're too valuable . Unique . You started all this by giving the bracelet to Clayton . Your father ... never wanted you to have it . ( EVE SNIFFS ) He said that you were too ... unstable . ( NIKHAL ) Now , now , Harry . Calm down . Please , please . I am begging you . - Cut off my arm ! Take the bracelet ! - I can 't . It 's joined to you now . That 's obvious to me . That was my father 's fault . He messed up the handover . Vincent Lermontov was your father ? Hmm , my adopted father . The adoption was kept secret , but the boys at the boarding school they sent me to figured it out . Nicknamed me Golding after gold foundling . - What do you want ? - Harry ... You have a choice to make . What choice ? Tomorrow morning , I 'm going to have someone kill Richard . And I 'm going to kill Anna and Daisy . Unless you kill yourself . ( DOOR UNLOCKS ) Come on , Clayton . Good to go , Steve . PRISONER : Slash your throat . They 'll blame me . No one 's gonna believe that Harry Clayton killed himself . I 'm the perfect fall guy . They caught me three weeks ago , so ... Are you really gonna do this ? If I don 't they 'll bring my brother up from the hospital wing . Kill him . They 'll kill my wife . And my daughter . Listen to me . Your brother 's not in the hospital wing anymore . They released him last night . I saw it happen . He 's gone . Those guards will be back in about ten minutes to check on you . Oh , Jesus . Harry ... Harry ! Harry , listen to me . You saved my life . I owe you . Come and help me with it , then . - Where does it go ? - It 's a tunnel between B and C wings . They use it to move drugs between Remand and the lifers on C wing . It 's only gonna get you so far , though . You 're gonna need this . Will it get me out of prison ? No , but C Wing 's got access to the roof . You 've got the bracelet . - Are you coming ? - No . I was never lucky . Go . ( GATE CLANGS ) Where is he ? Where 's Clayton ? Eh ? Where 's Clayton ? ( YELLS ) Where 's Clayton ? Sir ! Move it ! Oh , you ... Did Clayton go down here ? Come with me ! Give me that ! ( GROANS ) All Clayton will be thinking about is Anna and Daisy . Who are secure . Harry will do everything he can to find them . - Can I be frank , sir ? - Sure . There 's a point in every operation when you have to ask if the ends justify the means . And do you think we 've reached that point with Clayton ? I understand that you have some very personal reasons for needing Clayton dead , and for retrieving this bracelet . But if we pursue him now , then we are in serious danger of exposing everything that we have all worked so hard to set up . You have one more chance . ( SIGHS ) Mum , look ! The pool . WOMAN : Nikhal 's on his way . He wanted you to just hang out and relax before he got back . - When will he be here ? - He should be here just before lunch . Is there anything you or your daughter don 't eat ? I 'm a gluten-free , lactose-intolerant vegan . - She 's 11 . - ( CHUCKLES ) Listen , I 've been trying to get a signal since we got here . Oh , sorry . It 's pretty crap round here . Really ? In Hampstead ? - Hmm . - What about up there in the garden ? It 's pretty crap everywhere . Believe me . RADIO : Attention , all vans . We have a prisoner escaped . Repeat , we have a prisoner escaped . Please check all vans and report back . There he is ! Charlie , pull the van around ! ( DOG BARKS ) ( WOMAN WHIMPERS ) ( POLICE SIREN ) ( Y ELLS ) DRIVER : Mate ! Mate , I didn 't see you . ORWELL : Clayton escaped at 9 : 09am . Apparently , he clung to the underside of a prison van . I want to head up the operation to recapture him . Do you think he 's still east ? That 's where I 'll start OK . Get going . Harry 's too smart to do this . They must have tried to kill him in prison . I want you to be Orwell 's second . - How do I play this ? - Carefully . We have to assume Golding is still chasing Harry as well . ( SLOT MACHINE TRILLS ) It 's not paying out . I wouldn 't waste your money . Really ? I 'd take it . ( MACHINE PLAYS TUNE ) It 's not enough . ( MACHINE PLAYS TUNE ) TV : The escape from Whitecross Prison happened this morning . The public are warned that he is dangerous and not to be approached . ( PHONE RINGS ) Hello ? Ruth , it 's Harry . Please don 't hang up . I need to talk to Anna . Harry , Anna and Daisy aren 't here . Where are they ? Ruth , it 's important you answer the question . A car came to pick them up very early this morning . HARRY : Where was it going ? Um , Anna said something about spending the weekend with Nikhal . Do you have an address for Nikhal ? An address ? Yes , I ... I ... Yes , I - | think I 've got something here . Um ... hold on a minute . Uh ... Mahogany Apartment , St Pancras Hotel , WC1 . Thanks , Ruth . The police will be on their way to you . Say nothing about this conversation . RADIO : Suspect sighted leaving St Anne 's Church on Bethnal Green Road . Suspect now running down Buxton Road . DI Orwell to DS Clark , we 're on Buxton Road , Bethnal Green . What is your current location ? Over . - Two minutes away from you . - He 's definitely in this area . Repeat , he 's definitely here . RADIO : Suspect continuing Weston Buxton Road . You should have eyes on the suspect soon . Airborne One out . ( DOOR RATTLES ) Can I help you with something , Anna ? Why is this door locked ? For security reasons . ls there something you need ? I just want to go to the high street and get a few things . Tell me what it is you need . I 'll send someone to fetch it for you . I 'd rather get them myself . Why won 't you open this door ? This is ridiculous ! Are we not allowed out of this house ? Nikhal will be back here very soon . He 'll explain everything then . What are you talking about ? There 's been some trouble at the prison . That 's why he 's delayed . Why don 't you go back and join your daughter ? You don 't want to cause her any unnecessary distress , do you ? No . I 'm sorry . We are fully booked that day . But we do have availability on the 20th . - One second . - Do you have private apartments ? - Third floor . - Thanks . RECEPTIONIST : Yes , we do ... I 've got a positive sighting for Clayton at St Pancras Station . From DS Chohan all received . Housekeeping . Housekeeping . ( MAID MUTTERS ) ( LOCK BEEPS ) ( LOCK BEEPS ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( HARRY GROANS ) ( SCREAMS ) This way . Chohan . POLICE RADIO : There 's been a fatality at the St Pancras Hotel . Sir , there 's been a major incident at the hotel . ORWELL : It 's him . Come on . Clark , am I right in saying that Anna Clayton 's mother has just reported Anna and Daisy missing ? Yes , sir . We 've got a team over there now . She was held at gunpoint and forced to give an address for them to Harry . - What for ? - I don 't know . But the address she gave was Governor Julian 's flat here in St Pancras . Apparently , Anna Clayton and him are seeing each other . Yeah , yeah , I know . Right , I want you to email a photograph of Charles Collins to Anna 's mother . See if she can identify him as the gunman . Yes , sir . We need to figure out who this is and why Harry came here to kill him . There are other ways this could have played out . Sir ? We 've got a witness who saw Harry throw the victim over the balcony . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Rich ... RICH : They 're waiting for you outside . I know . They said you 'd escaped . I told them you wouldn 't be stupid enough to come here , but guess I was wrong . - I am so sorry . - Really ? - It should have been me . - ( RICH SCOFFS ) Would have made more sense . They killed Barbara , Harry . They murdered her . And then they got me . And they jumped up and down on my arm , over and over , until it kept breaking . The doctor said I was lucky that they could reset it . Rich , I badly need your help . ( LAUGHS ) We 're done . - No . - You 're toxic . Everything close to you gets destroyed . There 's me . There 's Mum . There 's Francis . And yet nothing ever happens to Harry , does it ? - Rich , don 't do this . - No . Nothing ever happens to Harry . I don 't want you in my life anymore . - No . - OK ? Now ... I 'm gonna give you 30 seconds , and then I 'm gonna call you in . I can 't risk not doing everything by the book now because of you . - They probably saw you come in . - It 's Anna and Daisy . - What ? - Julian has Daisy . Julian ? Governor Julian is Golding . I have to find them . I love you . ( ENGINE STARTS ) - ( PHONE RINGS ) - Suri ? Collins is dead . I think he came after Harry , and now he 's dead . - Are you absolutely sure it 's him ? - Yes , sir . Orwell hasn 't ID 'd him yet , but it 's just a matter of time . - Are you still at the crime scene ? - Yes , sir . Right , you need to leave there . Now . What do I say to Orwell ? - Nothing . Just leave . - Sir ? Anna and Daisy Clayton have been abducted . Her signal was lost somewhere on Hampstead Lane . I 'm coming to get you . Don 't say anything to Orwell . Handle this , will you ? Hey . HEY ! Where the hell are you going ? I have to help the super . You don 't just march away from my team without my permission . It 's Winter 's orders . Sorry . Why ? He needs backup . We 're about to question Frierson . Where did the tip-off on Becker 's body come from ? You never filed it . I have a manhunt to run . ( $ 055 ) ( FOOTSTEPS ) Who is your brother ? Adopted . How could Vincent let him kill my mother ? Why would he let that happen ? If she was a torch , if he loved her so much ... Because my father loved him more . Are you going to do this willingly ? Or are we going to have to use other means ? I 'll cooperate . PAUL : Good . Now , come with me . ( PIANO MUSIC ) What the hell 's going on ? Why are we being kept prisoner here ? It 's for your own protection . Harry 's escaped from Whitecross . ANNA : What ? Harry would never hurt us . You don 't know Harry anymore . He 's psychologically unhinged . ( WHISPERS ) He 's killed a man who tried to capture him . I 'm sorry , I don 't believe that for a second . It doesn 't explain why all the doors are locked - and Mrs Danvers won 't let anyone out . - I 'm just taking precautions . Why did you pay for my firm to take on Kevin Grey 's case ? And ask for me specifically to represent him ? You 're a very smart woman , Anna . Did Harry ever really appreciate you ? Who the hell are you ? I 'm the man you betrayed Harry for . I 'm also the man you 've been looking for at Whitecross . Come on , Daisy . We have to go right now . - What 's going on , Mum ? - ANNA : We 're going to take a bus home . Come with me . We 're walking to the high street . - Let 's go outside , Daisy . - Mum ! - Don 't , you bitch ! Daisy ! - Mum ! - No ! Daisy ! Let me go ! - Mum ! ( YELLS ) Daisy ! Daisy ! Daisy ! Let her go ! Let her go ! Detective Clayton . I told you on the intercom Mr Lermontov wasn 't in . - I didn 't believe you . Where are they ? - ( GROANS ) He 's left for his father 's house in Hampstead . POLICE RADIO : Control to DSI Winter , Anna Clayton 's last known phone location is confirmed as Ashton House , Hampstead . AR19 have been alerted and are en route there now . You started all this back with Kevin Grey , just to get to me . Is Nate in on this , too ? He 's just someone I run into a few times . A businessman . Did you plan to get inside my life like this from the beginning ? I thought it was a wonderful romance . You 're insane . I don 't understand what you can possibly hope to gain . This is all about Harry . Harry has stolen something from me . And I want it back . - Yes , your money . - If only it were that simple . Are you a religious woman , Anna ? You see , all the wars in this world are not fought over money or material things . They are all fought over belief . More specifically , the primacy of one man 's belief over another man 's . Harry has stolen my right to believe . How did you fall for such a broken , worthless gambler ? I can 't possibly imagine . WOMAN : Your brother called . He 's on his way . Good . Harry won 't be far behind . Get them ready . - Take her upstairs . - ( GRUNTS ) ( COUGHS AND GASPS ) - ( GASPS ) - NIKHAL : I owe you an apology . When I killed your mother , I was young . Naive . I didn 't really understand how much trouble it would cause me later . I will never put that bracelet on you . Whatever our father might have told you in those last days , he didn 't want it to end like this . Vincent didn 't want you near the bracelet . That 's why he always kept you secret . ( GRUNTS ) ( WHISPERS ) You have a lot of your mother in you . She said pretty much the exact same thing to me 15 years ago . ( EVE GRUNTS ) SURI : Ashton House , it 's registered to Lermontov Industries . If Golding has Anna and Daisy there , they could be hidden anywhere . Detective Superintendent Winter to AR19 . We 're five minutes from Ashton House . What 's your ETA ? POLICE RADIO : ETA Ashton House , ten minutes . ( SIRENS WAIL ) SURI : Ashton House , next left , sir . ( GROANS ) ( Y ELLS ) Get off me ! ( SIGHS ) DAISY : Mum . Get off ! - ( ANNA GRUNTS ) - DAISY : Mum ! ( CHAIN RATTLES ) ( WHIMPERS ) ANNA : Please , Nikhal ! Please ! Please ! NIKHAL : Harry will be here soon . Give me the key . Please , Nikhal ! Please ! Please let her go . Please . Please let her go . SURI : Harry ! - Alistair ... - Harry , it 's OK . It 's OK . I believe you . - And I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . - OK . No ! Harry , get down ! ( SURI SCREAMS ) SURI : Sir ! ( GROANS ) ( Y ELLS ) SURI : Sir , it 's gonna be OK . It 's gonna be OK . ( WINTER GROANS ) Alistair , stay with us . Hold on . Hold on . Hold ... on . ( GROANS ) ANNA : Daisy ! SURI : Go ! I 've got this . DS Chohan . Officer down . Shot to the chest . TEMS required . ( SIRENS WAIL ) ( MUFFLED SHOUTS ) He has Daisy and Anna ! POLICE RADIO : DS Chohan from AR19 . ETA , six minutes . No ! Stop ! No ! Stop ! Wait ! Stop ! Stop ! Don 't shoot . Truth is , Harry , I 'm scared to fire this at you . Who knows what would happen if I did ? Even though I am a crack shot , it 'd probably miss you by an inch , bounce off the floor and end up in my gullet . Or worse . The gun could explode in my face . Please . Let them go . I 'll do whatever you want . No , you won 't . Or haven 't you figured that out yet ? - HARRY : What ? - The bracelet won 't let you ! It protects your life ! In every way that it can ! It influences your choices ! It is the ultimate survivor . That 's why Dad chose the highest building in London and why you are going to put this gun in your mouth ... ( sum COCKS ) ... and pull the trigger . ( MUFFLED SCREAM ) ( DAISY SCREAMS ) EVE : No ! ( AN NA SCREAMS ) - Give me the key . - Shoot yourself . - Please ! - Then I 'll let her live . Please ! Just give me the key ! You 're running out of time to save her , Harry . Put it in your mouth and pull the trigger ! OK ! Do it ! ( GASPS ) Harry ! Armed police ! Get down ! On the ground now . Julian ! Armed police ! Don 't move ! ( AN NA SCREAMS ) I 've got Mrs Clayton . Just go after Julian please . ( PANTS ) HARRY : Come on . Come on ! One , two , three , four , five , six . Come on , Daisy ! - Come on . - Please ! ANNA : Come on , honey . Work for me ! Please , work for me ! One , two , three , four , five ... Please . ( COUGHS ) - Daisy , Daisy ! ' Oh , my darling ! ( ANNA SOBS ) ( SOBS )

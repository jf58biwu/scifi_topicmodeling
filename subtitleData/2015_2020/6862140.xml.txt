 [ Shiro ] Coran ... How soon will we get to the Blade of Marmora 's base ? Based on the coordinates that Ulaz gave us , we should be there within a few doboshes . I can 't wait to see it ! I mean , they were able to fold space-time , and that was just at an outpost ! - Mm , the space taco . It left us too soon . - [ stomach grumbles ] Well , sure , but my point is , imagine how amazing their home base will be ! Exactly . It could take on any shape . Like a space jelly donut . Or long , like a space Ã©clair . Or a space cheese blintz with a cherry sauce on top . Maybe a little dusting of powdered sugar . That 's the stars . Aw ! Now , I 'm hungry for breakfast . Guys , this is a serious mission . We need to focus . [ mockingly ] " We need to focus . " - [ Coran ] The base is in range . - Take us in slowly . [ Coran ] That might prove the tiniest bit of a challenge . [ Hunk ] Is that a black hole ? [ Coran ] No , no , no , no , no . It 's two black holes and a giant blue star . [ Hunk ] That 's not better . No kidding . Just inside a black hole , the temperature is one millionth of a degree above absolute zero . But , just outside of that , it 's hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius . Okay , it 's like when you try to nuke a frozen burrito in the microwave , and it comes out all scorching hot on the outside , but it 's still frozen in the middle , right ? Now , I 'm hungry for lunch ! Guys , quiet ! Coran , where 's the base located ? In between those three deadly celestial objects . - The perfect defensive position . - Or the perfect trap . Yeah , I 'm with Allura . Maybe we shouldn 't , like , go in there at all ? What are you talking about ? We have to go in ! This is the whole reason we came out here ! There is no other option ! Okay . Jeez . Calm down . [ electronic beeping ] [ female computer voice ] Identify yourself . Open a hailing frequency , Coran . We are the Paladins of Voltron , sent here by Ulaz . Two may enter . Come unarmed . Why would they insist we come unarmed ? Shiro , this doesn 't feel right . We 've come too far to turn back now . They just sent us a route to the base , but we 'll have to move quickly . Because of the solar flares , it 's only open for another varga . Then , it will be closed for two quintants . - They 're gonna close it for two years ? - Two days . Oh . So , any thoughts on who 's gonna join you on this little mission ? I 'm thinking things might get a little hot , so you 're gonna want someone who can stay cool . You 're right . Keith , you 're coming with me . Keith 's a hothead ! He 's probably going to shoot first and ask questions later ! And they 're not gonna be able to answer his questions because they 'll be dead ! We haven 't yet severed Zarkon 's link with the Black Lion , so it has to stay here . And the Red Lion can withstand the heat from that sun . So , yes , it 'll be Keith . [ Coran ] The course to the base will be quite treacherous , to say the least . You 're walking a razor 's edge between the gravitational pull of the black holes and the sun . One false move , and you 'll either be crushed into infinity or burnt to a crisp . - Keith , is everything okay ? - I 'm fine . You kind of blew up at everybody back there . You 'll have to control your emotions if you 're going to lead this group someday . [ chuckles ] Lead the group ? When we were stranded , I told you , if anything ever happens to me , I want you to lead Voltron . I thought you were just delirious with pain . Why would you make me the leader ? Because I know what you 're capable of , if you can learn some self-discipline . Why are we even talking about this ? Nothing is gonna happen to you . It 's just in case . I need you to get focused . When you and Allura ran off , it put us all in jeopardy . If you 're going to be a leader , you 've got to get your head on straight . I 'm sorry . I 've just had a lot on my mind . I know . We all have . - [ grunts ] - [ alarm blaring ] [ Keith ] We 're getting drawn in by one of the black holes ! Get us out of here ! Great job ! That was close . There 's nothing here . This place just looks like a plain asteroid . [ loud rumbling ] I am going to ask you some questions . I will know if you lie . I am Kolivan , leader of the Blade of Marmora . My name is Shiro and this is Keith . We are Paladins of Voltron . [ Kolivan ] I know who you are . [ Shiro ] Then you know we were sent by one of your own . [ Kolivan ] Ulaz was a fool to divulge this location to you . He had a penchant for ignoring orders and following his impulses . That 's what got him killed . He gave his life to save us ! What he did brought us here today , and Voltron is ready to assist you . Are we welcome here or not ? You were told to come unarmed . You also told us to identify ourselves . The lions are about as close as we come to an ID . If anything happens , believe me , you 'll be happy you have the Red Lion on your side . I imagine we would . However , I wasn 't referring to your beast . [ grunting ] Keith ! He has one of our blades ! Who did you steal this from ? I didn 't ! I 've had it all my life ! [ guard ] Lies ! [ Kolivan ] Can you corroborate your friend 's statement ? Does this blade truly belong to him ? [ Shiro ] I ... I don 't know . Shiro , you know me . I promise you I didn 't steal it . I 've had this knife as long as I can remember . - We can 't trust them . - I 'm telling the truth . I saw Ulaz had a knife like this . Tell me what it means . Our organization is built on secrecy and trust . You two should leave . Now . We came here to form an alliance , but obviously , we 're not welcome . - Come on , Keith , we 're leaving . - Not without some answers . Somehow , one of your knives ended up with me on planet Earth . Tell me how . [ Kolivan ] Your friend is right . It is time for you to go . Where did it come from ? I have to know . You seek knowledge ? There is only one way to attain knowledge here . - How ? I 'll do it ! - The trials of Marmora . Should you survive , you may keep the blade and its secrets will be revealed . Survive ? Keith , this is crazy . If they 're not going to help us , let 's get of here . I 'm not going anywhere . I have to do this . Antok , give the boy the blade . We will meet again . Can 't wait . These trials result in one of two things . Knowledge or death . Surrender the blade . You cannot win . [ growls ] [ grunting ] [ Keith grunting ] [ screams , groans ] Come on , Keith . [ grunts , groans ] Surrender the blade and the pain will cease . I won 't quit . Then the pain continues . You are not meant to go through that door . This is not a fair fight ! Nor is taking on the Galra , yet that is the fight we face . [ screams ] Surrender the blade and the pain will cease . Never ! You are not meant to go through that door . [ breathing heavily ] [ Shiro ] How long does this go on ? Sometimes , the greatest challenge is knowing when to stop . - He 'll never quit . - One way or another , this will end . Knowledge or death . [ yells ] - [ Allura ] How long has it been ? - Roughly ten vargas . We cannot just wait here . The path is closed for , like , I don 't know , 30 more vargas or something ? - That 's actually correct . - Really ? Yeah , I wasn 't born yester-quintant . I-I have to know what 's going on down there . There 's no way to get a read on their base . Too much interference from the solar flares and the black holes . If we account for the gravitational lensing , maybe we can reduce the noise and interference and connect with the Red Lion 's sensors , right ? Th-That 's right , right ? - Are you looking at me ? - We can give it a try . Get on it . - [ electronic beeping ] - [ metal clanging ] Haggar wishes to speak with you . [ breathing heavily ] [ grunts ] Keith ! Guess I really wasn 't supposed to go through that door . [ groans ] Hey , man . You did it . Shiro ? [ grunting ] Kolivan told me you lasted longer than anyone ever has in those battles . - You don 't have to keep this up . - What are you talking about ? Just give them the knife and let 's get out of here . I can 't give it to them , Shiro . Is that a hologram ? His suit has the ability to create a virtual mindscape , reflecting its wearer 's greatest hopes and fears . And , at this moment , your friend desperately wants to see you . What is it with you and that thing ? It 's the only connection I have to my past . It 's my chance to learn who I really am . You know exactly who you are , a Paladin of Voltron . We 're all the family you need . Shiro , you 're like a brother to me ... but I have to do this . No , you don 't . So , just give them the knife . - I can 't do that . - Just give up the knife , Keith ! You 're only thinking of yourself , as usual ! I 've made my choice . Then you 've chosen to be alone . Shiro ! Wait ! - [ loud rumbling ] - Huh ? Huh ... [ man ] Keith ... [ gasps ] Dad ? You 're home , son . - [ loud rumbling ] - What 's going on outside ? Don 't worry about that . We 'll be fine as long as we stay in here . Don 't you want to catch up ? Of course I do . [ sighs ] Son , so many years have passed . - I have so much to tell you . - [ loud rumbling ] What is that ? Everything 's fine . [ gasps ] [ people screaming ] Dad , I-I 'm sorry . I gotta go . There 's people that need me out there . Don 't you want to know about where you came from ? Your mother gave it to me . Mom ? - [ loud rumbling ] - [ people screaming ] She 'll be here soon . [ grunting ] - You need to get him out of there . - He can decide when to leave . You 're messing with his mind . You 're going to kill him ! Knowledge or death , Shiro . I 'm calling this off . [ groaning ] You gotta tell me , Dad . I have to know . Where did the knife come from ? What does it mean ? Your mother is almost here . She 'll tell you everything . I can 't wait around anymore . I have to go . If you go out that door , you 'll never find out who you are . Goodbye , Dad . [ roars ] - The Red Lion is moving ! - We gotta get down there ! [ Hunk ] It won 't be ready for five more minutes . I am going to ask you some questions . I will know if you lie . I have reason to believe that a spy has infiltrated Galra command . That is very alarming . Indeed . Are you aware of any spies within our ranks ? No . Commander Thace , are you the one who lowered the solar barrier during the Voltron attack , allowing it to escape ? No . I fight in the name of Galra . I am loyal to Zarkon . You will help me root out this traitor . We will destroy him and all who threaten our reign . The Red Lion is attacking the base ! It 's trying to break through ! It has a link with Keith . It knows when he 's in danger . It 's coming for him . [ all grunt ] [ electronic beeping ] The Red Lion has started attacking ! Wait , what does that mean ? Why would the lion attack ? Unless ... - Allura ? - Everyone , stay focused . [ faint rumbling ] - [ running footsteps approaching ] - [ faint rumbling ] - Keith , are you okay ? - Stop what you 're doing ! What are you talking about ? What 's going on ? - Call off your beast ! - Move out of the way ! We 're leaving ! You 're not leaving with that blade . It does not belong to you . You failed to awaken it ! - What does that mean ? - Give up the blade ! [ grunts ] Coran , how much longer until we can get in ? Just a few more ticks , Princess . Get ready . Wait ! Just take the knife ! It doesn 't matter where I come from . I know who I am . We all need to work together to defeat Zarkon . If that means I give up this knife , fine . Take it . Mm ? You 've awoken the blade ! The only way this is possible is if Galra blood runs through your veins . [ Coran ] Five ... four ... three ... two ... one ! [ Shiro ] Princess , we 're coming back , and we 're bringing someone you should meet . - They 're all right ! - Yes , they did it ! Princess Allura , it 's good to see that the rumors are true . You 're still alive after all these years . So is Zarkon . Can we consider you our ally in the fight against him ? Yes , but we have little time to discuss this . I just received word from our spy inside the Galran hierarchy . They have become aware of our presence , so the timetable for our plan has been moved up . How soon do we need to begin ? Now .

 Previously on " The 100 " ... We didn 't treat her . Abby : Her body 's rejecting the radiation on its own . Nightblood . You created a killer . On the street , they 're calling her Skairipa . Kane : Your decision-making has grown increasingly questionable . Ilian : I 'm glad you 're still alive . I never meant to hurt anyone . Sword doesn 't care what you meant . It just cuts . Kane : Pike stood right there . You do this and you 're no better than he was . [ Gunshot ] Kane : There 's a darkness in you , Octavia . Octavia : It 's the end of the world , Kane . Darkness is all we have left . [ Hoofbeats ] [ Thunder ] [ Man panting ] Why are you following me ? You won 't survive out here alone . Let me help you . You 've helped enough . You spared my life . I owe you . I don 't want anything from you . [ Thunder ] [ Winces ] [ Both wincing ] [ Horse whinnies ] _ Get on . What is it ? Now ! Go , Helios ! [ Horse whinnies ] [ Indistinct chatter ] Welcome back . [ Thunder ] Black rain . Everybody inside ! Black rain ! Sound the alarm ! - This is not a drill ! Go inside the Ark ! - Go ! Inside . Cover yourself . Take this . Everybody inside ! Kane , where 's Octavia ? Leave your things ! Everybody inside ! [ Thunder , people shouting ] Kane : Quickly ! Let go of me ! [ Groaning ] [ Screaming ] [ Panting ] Kane . Someone 's outside . Come on . - Louis . - [ Groaning ] We 're coming . Come on , come on . I got you , I got you . Come on . [ Thunder ] Aah ! [ Louis groaning ] I need to find Octavia . She 's not here . She took off hours ago . I gotta find her . Bellamy , look . We don 't know where she went . You just got back , and the Rover doesn 't have enough power to go - searching through the woods . - The rain - will kill her . - She 's smart . You gotta trust that she found shelter , ok ? Remember the drill ? All wet clothing in the designated zone . Arker : How do we know everyone made it in ? Arker 2 : My wife . She was outside the wall . I need to know if she 's ok . Kane : Check in with your section leaders . We 'll get a head count as soon as we can . Man on radio : Hello ? Can anyone hear me ? Look , we 're caught in the rain , and it burns . We 're trapped in the rubble just north of the factory crash . Please . Can anybody hear me ? This is Chancellor Kane . I hear you . Can you hear me ? Man : Kane . Kane , it 's Mark Colton . Look , please , my son is soaked with black rain . Please . You gotta help us . Hurry ! [ Horse whinnies ] [ Thunder ] [ Grunting ] [ Octavia panting ] There 's fresh water . [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] God , it burns . [ Panting ] [ Groaning ] The black rain . What does it mean ? It means we 're stuck in here until the storm passes . Doesn 't mean we need to talk . I need to wash off my horse . Why don 't you go make a fire ? You 're good at that . Jackson : This is Becca 's main research lab , but there are 5 other levels . Clarke : Incredible . God , it 's really you . Jackson : I 'll go check on Raven and Luna . Where 's Roan ? He 's unloading the fuel with the others . I just needed to see my mom . Don 't punish yourself . Going to space was at best a long shot . It was the only shot we had . Is that Raven ? She 's sedated in the bio lab . She had another seizure . Is that ... Abby : An ischemic stroke . Well , that means it can heal , right ? Yes . As long as she takes it easy , she 'll recover . She 's almost as stubborn as you are . And you ? How are you feeling ? I 'm fine . Mom , I spoke to Jackson . He doesn 't think you 're fine . When was the last time you slept ? Oh , I 'll sleep soon enough , one way or another . What is that ? It 's bone marrow . Luna 's . Abby : A theory that Jackson and I agreed should remain untested . What theory ? We can 't create Nightblood unless we go to space . But Luna can . Theoretically , we can inject ourselves with her bone marrow . Then we become Nightbloods . Will it work ? I think so . Then why 'd you take it off the table ? Because the only way to know if it works is to test it , and that would mean ... . Exposing someone to radiation . Can we do that here ? Yes . Becca was trying to find a cure for cancer using this radiation chamber . Clarke ... We would have to expose a human being to enough radiation that would implode every single cell in their body . That 's what 's coming for us . I know that , but you just said it . We have no choice . No . We have to make a choice . Who do we test ? Jackson : Emori , hey . I 'm heading up to the house . Does anyone want anything while I 'm up there ? Abby : No , we 're fine . Thanks , Emori . Hold on . Honey , you should go with her . Clarke : No . I just got here . I want to be here with you and help . There is nothing for you to help me with right now . It 'll be 5 hours before the samples are even ready to be tested . Ok . Go , take a shower , and we 'll figure this out when you get back . Go . Ok . I 'll lower the drones . [ Thunder ] - [ Coughing ] - Shh , shh , shh . Just breathe , Louis . [ Thunder ] [ People coughing ] [ Indistinct chatter ] I need to get him to med bay . Med bay 's full . Even with treatment , he wouldn 't survive this . I know it 's difficult , but we need to prioritize . I 'm the reason he 's not gonna survive this . He reached for me , and I didn 't help him . So help him now . Make him as comfortable as possible . Everyone else accounted for ? Jaha and Monty reported in from Sector 5 . All 200 of their people are safe . The other sectors are still counting . We 're down two . Not for long . [ Coughing ] Bellamy , the fire damage to that suit could cause tears you can 't see , much less seal . It 's the best we got . That 's Mark Colton out there . I know him . He 's resourceful . Right now they 're under an overhang , out of the rain . His son Peter was one of the 100 . I 'm doing this . [ Rain falling ] [ Panting ] [ Groaning ] Bellamy ! Bellamy , turn around ! [ Groaning ] Bellamy , what the hell happened ? [ Panting ] Bellamy . [ Panting ] - Bellamy , come in . - [ Panting ] You were right . The suit 's useless . You gotta come back in . Bring the Rover to the airlock . Mark on radio : Bellamy , it 's Mark . Are you there ? [ Panting ] - Right here . - [ Mark coughing ] Mark : Are you on the move yet ? Peter doesn 't look so good . Bellamy : He 's been through worse , we 'll get through this , too . I 'm on my way . Peter on radio : Copy that , Bellamy . Thanks . Bellamy , go to the private channel . [ Beep ] No more lectures . I can 't find my sister , but I do know where they are . Kane on radio : Bellamy , stop . Listen to me . No unnecessary risks . You come home safe . I got this . Emori : Raven says the black rain will be here soon . Clarke : Raven 's right . I used to love the rain . Now it terrifies me . I would have thought nothing terrified you . Did I say something wrong ? No . I just hate this island , that 's all . Murphy said you used to work here . Is that right ? Something like that . Scavenging tech for A.L.I.E. ? I 'm sorry . Too many questions . Ignore me . I 'm just upset that our mission here has failed . Hopefully your mother will come up with another way . You 're just like her . Willing to do anything to save your people . Skaikru 's lucky to have you . We 're not just doing this for Skaikru . We 're at the treeline . Coming in . Jackson on radio : Copy that . Drones down . You 're good to go . [ Rock music playing in distance ] Man : ♪ A really good thing to me ♪ [ Beeping ] You can cook ? Uhh . You can read . Yeah , I know what you 're thinking , Clarke . Why are all the good ones taken , right ? A good randzi is rare . John would be celebrated by any clan . Yeah , he 's a real catch . Mmm . Man : ♪ Living in a paradox ... ♪ Mmm . Man : ♪ I need you to show me the way ♪ Oh , my God . Uh-huh . Wow . [ Whispering ] [ Both laugh ] I 'm gonna go get cleaned up . Yeah , let me show you where to go . Upstairs . Down the hall . Man : ♪ Hit me ♪ Thanks . We 're getting out of here . What ? Now ? Why ? I 'll explain on the way to the bunker . I already told you the bunker 's not an answer . What 's going on ? What , did you see something out in the woods ? Are the scavengers back ? Even scavengers wouldn 't do to me what your people are about to . E-Emori , stop . What the hell are you talking about ? They 're gonna sacrifice someone to test Nightblood . Who do you think that 's gonna be , huh ? Clarke ? Raven ? I 'm the outsider , John , the freikdrana . Hey , hey , hey , slow down , slow down . Emori , look at me . Look at me . Breathe . - [ Exhales ] - Tell me everything . [ Beep ] [ Clattering ] [ Clattering ] [ Clattering ] [ Clattering ] [ Clattering ] Murphy ? [ Clattering ] Murphy , is that you ? [ Clattering ] [ Clattering ] [ Clattering continues ] Hey , hey , hey , hey . Take it easy . Look , we need to talk . Quiet . There 's someone here . [ Both grunting ] John ! John ! John ! [ Screaming ] John ! [ Both grunting ] Get the hell off of her ! [ Emori panting ] Clarke : Are you ok ? Can you stand ? Emori : Wait ! He 's mine . - Whoa , Emori . - You son of a bitch ! - Leave him , leave him . - Get off of me . If we don 't kill him now , he will kill us . You know him ? Baylis . She 's lying . You don 't know me . You said you 'd kill me . Well , guess what , planhaka , I 'm gonna kill you . Clarke : Hey , hey , hey , don 't move . Just let me go . I 'll leave the food , and you never have to see me again . Is he alone ? Not usually . Where are the others ? I don 't know who the hell you think ... Stumucha ! Clarke : Emori ! You don 't know what he did to me . No , and you can tell me about it , but please , Emori , if he 's not alone , we need to know now . Here , Murphy , take my gun . Now tie him up . There 's a medicine cabinet upstairs . Can I fix this ? Murphy won 't let him go anywhere . Will you , Murphy ? Not a chance . We 're gonna have some fun . Fine . Tie him up . But when he 's done talking , the kill is mine . Bellamy : Mark . Come in . Coming up on Factory Station . Almost to you . Over . Guys , you read me ? Bellamy on radio : Don 't go quiet on me now . Gonna need a little help navigating once I 'm past the wreckage . Come on , come on , come on . Mark on radio : Yeah , I 'm here . We 're northwest of the salvage area at about 15 degrees . Just follow the ... Peter ! What 's happening ? Are you ok ? Mark on radio : Peter , get below me . Bellamy ! Mark , what 's going on ? Mark on radio : The wind shifted . The rain is blowing in . Ok , you need to find something to use for cover . Mark on radio : There 's nothing here . Look , I 'm blocking it from Peter as best as I can . Just hurry . Please ! Look south . You 'll see my headlights in two minutes . I 'm ... Come on . [ Engine revs ] Damn it . [ Grunting ] [ Engine revving ] No ! No ! Mark : Bellamy , I don 't see the lights . Where are you ? Just ... just a minor delay . Just hang on . Mark on radio : No ! No ! No , we can 't ! We can 't ! How long ? Bellamy , what 's happening ? Answer . What minor delay ? Stuck in the mud . Gonna use the winch to get me out . Negative . Bellamy , you have no suit and I can hear the rain over the radio . Please , just ... just wait for the storm to pass . Is that clear ? [ Peter coughing on radio ] Mark on radio : Bellamy ! Peter needs help now , right now ! He can 't breathe ! If you go into that storm , 3 people die instead of two . You 're out of options . It 's time to let go . Mark on radio : You said you 'd be here . Where the hell are you ? What am I supposed to tell them ? The truth . Mark . Peter . I can 't get to you . Mark on radio : What ? No . We 'll come to you . Please , I can carry him . It 's too far , Mark . You won 't make it . Mark on radio : Listen . We won 't make it here ! Look . I ... I am sorry . You just ... your only chance is just to wait a little longer , and when the rain stops , I can dig out . Mark on radio : My son is dying ! He 's dying right now . You said that you would help us . Please ! No ! No ! [ Thunder ] You did more damage than you took . Not enough . Not yet . Don 't tell me you 've never killed for revenge . Well , then , I guess you 're better than me , because I 'm going to . But first I 'm gonna make him suffer for what he did to me and my brother . I 'm gonna cut him for every time he cut me . I 'm gonna make him beg the way I begged . Emori . We 're not gonna let him hurt you again . I don 't need you to protect me , Clarke . I protect myself . I always have . - I understand . - Like hell you do . I was cast out of my clan as an infant because of this . I was forced to steal to survive . Forced to kill . You were loved . Told you were special . I was thrown away like someone 's garbage . You know nothing of my pain . No . I don 't . But I do know what it feels like to think you have no choice but to kill . You think I have a choice ? If we let Baylis live , he will come back . Nothing will stop him from punishing me for leaving . If we show even the slightest hesitation , he will use it . He will say anything to survive . And the second we let our guard down , he will strike . He will kill us all . But I am not gonna let that happen , Clarke , because today , I am the commander of death . I only came here for the food . Things I can trade . I scavenge so my family can eat . Please . [ Murphy chuckles ] That 's it . Find the right angle . I 'll help you out . I love someone who was beaten and tortured by a man who thought he could control her . I 'm not that man . You can torture me all you want , and that won 't change the fact ... Who 's the scared child now , Baylis ? For my brother . For me ! - Wait . - What ? You 'll kill him . That 's the idea . Why don 't you stay out of it and let her have this , Clarke ? What if his death could save us all ? Ilian : Where will you go when the storm passes ? I don 't know , either . If I go home , I 'll see their faces everywhere . In everything . The windmill I helped my father build to grind the corn for the sheep . The room I shared with my brother . The fence ... The fence I tied my mother to ... before I cut off her fingers . Before I cut my father 's throat . Before I cut my brother 's throat . Go home , Ilian . You 're not a murderer . You feel the way you 're supposed to feel after you take a life . I feel nothing . Now go back to your stupid sheep . I don 't believe you . I saw the pain in your face when you aimed that gun at my head . We 're done talking . You may not want to feel it , but it 's there . I should 've pulled the trigger . - Why didn 't you ? - Just shut up . You think you 're a killer , but you couldn 't kill me . Whatever escape from the pain you were looking for wasn 't there anymore . I told you my sad story . Tell me yours . What made you like this ? Just shut up ! [ Exhales ] I think the person you were before this happened ... is still in there . You 're wrong . [ Thunder ] Octavia . Octavia . [ Thunder ] Octavia , no ! No ! No ! I need this ! I need this ! Let me go ! I needed this to happen ! Let me go ! - Stop ! - I should have killed you . [ Grunting ] Stop ! [ Both grunting ] - Stop . - Let me up , please . Stop . Stop . Just make me feel something else . Octavia . Kane on radio : Abby , are you there ? Come in . I 'm here . Ah , it 's so good to hear your voice . I have bad news , Abby . The black rain 's here . It 's worse than we thought . It , uh ... it burns on contact . It kills . After today , the water won 't be drinkable . We lost what we had stored in the fire . We have enough for a couple of weeks , but after that ... I know what happens after that . We need a solution . Abby , are you there ? I 'm here . There may be a solution . - That 's great . - But to find it , I have to do something that I never thought I 'd have to do . You 'll make the right decision . You always do . Can I ask you something ? Anything . If I take a life ... to find a cure ... does that make me a murderer ? [ Sighs ] Abby , I ... I don 't know how to answer that . I wish I did . What if it can save us all ? Would I be able to live with myself then ? Taking a life should never be easy . I hope it 's not easy for you . Your humanity is your greatest strength . Sometimes we need a different kind of strength . We need to survive . Then we can all find our humanity again . Abby on radio : I hope you 're right , Marcus . [ Harper crying ] No . [ Sniffling ] Bellamy on radio : Mark , Peter ? I have to go . - Be safe . - You , too , Abby . Bellamy on radio : Response 's on its way out . You still with me ? [ Thunder ] Bellamy : Hey , Mark , come in . Do you read me ? As soon as this rain clears , I 'm out of this ditch and I 'm on my way . Please tell me that you read me . Kane on radio : Bellamy ... you did your best . I failed . They 're dead . It 's not your fault . I can 't protect anyone . I couldn 't protect my sister . It was my responsibility , and I failed . My mom passed out . She was there . She was in my hands . She was so helpless , and now what is she ? Is she even alive ? What is she ? I ... You didn 't fail , Bellamy . You did everything you could for her . You came to the ground for her . You can 't save someone who doesn 't want to be saved . Your mother would be proud of the man you 've become . I know I am . You floated my mother . Who you want to be doesn 't always win . Storm 's over . [ Ilian sighs ] Yeah . You have somewhere to go now ? I 'm going home . Back to my stupid sheep . Walk into the setting sun , and you 'll find it . Or don 't . Jim James : ♪ Daylight come ♪ ♪ Daylight go ♪ ♪ How far will it reach ? ♪ Get on . I 'll take you home .

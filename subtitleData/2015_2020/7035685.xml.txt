 Previously on amc 's " fear the walking dead " ... Tell your people it 's time for justice . The land you 've lived on needs to be returned . We 're not attacking . The walker 's not going away . He 's weak . If he 's weak , he 'll negotiate . I think we can be friends now . There 's a fight coming , and you have to save us . Can you ? Yes , ma 'am . Black cat reservation - - You 're the only one that can do this . I 've dealt with him . I 've settled with him . I 've beaten him . What the hell are you doing here ? The trimbols are dead . What ? Wh- - After they left , they were killed . It was walker 's people . You tell anyone you were coming ? You didn 't want anyone to know . You didn 't want anyone to stop you , but this changes things . I was worried . Vernon and kathy ? Mike ? And gretchen . Son of a bitch . Talking to walker right now , it 's not a good idea . This- - this makes it more urgent , more reason to go , not less . When i said for you to own it , I didn 't mean this . I 'm not doing this because of what you said , alicia . Right . I 'm coming with you . No , you 're not . It 's- - it 's a gas station . Tribal headquarters . Their land runs 10 miles in either direction . What happens next ? We walk in . Hands . Qaletaqa ! Hello , taqa . You 're 200 years too late for peace , jake . But just in time for lunch . Alicia didn 't come home last night . She 's a big girl now . I don 't think she 's in the camp . She 's probably with golden boy . Strange not to see either of them , All the shit that went down . Will you go to jake 's ? No . Leave her be , mom . Morning . You , uh , seen your daughter ? No . Jake 's awol with some gear and he 's not in his quarters . I know your daughter and him are , uh ... Courting . Could they just sneak past the guards ? There 's a lot of acreage out there , And jake does know every inch of it , So it could be . Well , where should we start looking ? We don 't . What ? I can 't spare another search party , And i 'm not sending these good folks out there After all that 's happened- - indians on the warpath . Point me in the right direction . You won 't make it a mile out there . So what , i just sit around , thumb up my ass , like you ? You feel strong , son ? Hmm ? Wanna arm up , man up ? Troy 's taking on new recruits . He 'll fix it up so it 's not like We 're sending a sheep out to slaughter . I 'm in . Nick , come on . My father will never abandon the ranch . You know that . Then we 'll feed him to the crows Like phil mccarthy . Then russell brown and vernon trimbol . Russell 's dead . The adobe burned . That karma 's overdue but welcomed . Vernon trimbol 's dead , too . I hope it was a long and ... Painful illness . He died with his family . His wife , his daughter . You killed them . Is this girl speaking for you ? We need the violence to stop . Soon will , jake . Three down , One to go . My father never did anything to you or your people . Tell me , junior , do the lies turn your stomach ? Do you taste the bile in the back of your throat ? State police investigated this . They found no correlation between- - stop ... Talking . You 're boring me , like you did in court . Those days are dead . I thought we had an understanding , Even outside of court . I understood . When you came here with your drunk friends , I was to serve them their food with a smile on my face , Tolerate their slurs , clean up their vomit in the toilet , And thank them for their pocket-change tips . The days of the white man 's courts are over . Land grabs , desecrations , over . Now you have our verdict , The first humans verdict . You must vacate our lands . I was hoping for a parley . A chance to negotiate and to avoid more loss . Maybe you 're right . If a parley can spare blood ... We can talk about it . after we eat . Give them a half-hour , okay ? Okay . Here to sign up . Got a note from home ? That 's funny . No , I 'm serious . Madison okay with this ? You want to go ask her ? You need her permission ? Why , though ? Why- - why join the militia ? I don 't know , maybe , uh ... I feel bad about what i 've done . You ever feel that way about anything ? You know , you do something , then people die . And then things get worse . Maybe you should leave before worse things happen . Yeah . I got travis killed , And now my mom has to bear that loss . And my sister 's missing . I need an occupation . Don 't be too hard on yourself . Also , i want to protect us From the ones who killed the trimbols . What i saw was savage . Let 's , uh- - Let 's not spook the young recruits , huh ? Here . How the hell 'd you get here ? It 's a long story . Tell it . Tell me , then i 'll tell you how I tried to find you And almost got goddamn eaten , how we all almost died Because you took the truck and the hotel was overrun . Alicia , I thought it was safe . We checked every room . Nowhere is safe . Sorry . If it makes you feel any better , I almost died after that . It doesn 't . Qaletaqa found me . He took me in . These are good people . Well , these good people , They killed a family two nights ago . His daughter was my friend . No , there was no- - There was no mission two nights ago . How do you know that ? Taqa goes out with the war parties . He didn 't . He was with me . We have a parley . I need you to go back and tell my father the terms . Taqa will send a scout with you . You 're staying here ? We swap hostages and offer tribute . Jake , your father 's not gonna listen to me . He barely knows me . Alicia ... This is the only way to put off their attack . Taqa guarantees my safety . His word is good . Then I 'll stay . No . Jake , your father needs to hear this from you . You have to sell it . Do we have a parley or not ? It appears we do . Okay . Do i have to worry ? I 'd rather back the militia when we 're attacked Than hold the rear with the old-timers . If there 's an attack . You gonna go back-to-back with troy ? Keep your enemies close , right ? Is that what this is ? How do I look ? Jake ! Jake ! What ? Ofelia ? Madison . What the hell 's going on ? Alicia followed me to black hat . What happened to her ? She 's safe , she 's safe . I made a deal with walker . You left her ? It 's part of the custom . Alicia 's their hostage . I 'm the hostage on this side . What kind of barbaric bullshit is that ? What custom ? Alicia offered to stay to avoid more bloodshed . The sooner i talk to my father , the sooner we get her back . And if not ? How much time is sooner ? Just travel back and forth , plus a day to talk . And we will get her back . Walker gave me his word . Walker is a killer . I promise you i would not have left her there If i didn 't think she was gonna be safe . I care about her . How long were you at that place ? Long enough to know that walker 's word is good . Yeah ? Yeah . He told me he wanted us off the ranch . Said he 'd kill us if we stayed . Has that changed ? Only jake would know that . Water is precious . You 'll have to learn to conserve , Especially in the kitchen . I 'm not gonna be here for that long . You 'll contribute while you are . Is a hostage the same thing as a prisoner ? We call ourselves pony warriors Even though we drive jeeps , trucks . Soon we 'll have our own air force . Jose and marta , two of the best mechanics Out of the Iraq war . It was good shooting . Crazy dog was an army sniper . Your america 's offered us some useful tools . Took everything , but gave us some things in trade . The sun had set . We had waited there all day . We were about to head back when we heard it . I know . I was on it when you shot us down . You were lucky to have made it . We were hoping it was one of the ottos . Jake wasn 't the only one . It was one of my family members . You killed him . You hate me . Good . Maybe you can understand The anger i have towards the ottos . Magnify that hate a thousand times , And maybe you can understand . I do hate you . I hate you for killing travis , For thinking you know how I feel . You don 't . You 're just a hypocrite Playing the noble native american . They need water . There 's nothing left in their catch basins . The drought 's five years old now , And they 're desperate . Damn right . Grasshopper and the ant . And they 're ready to take it from us . Let them come . Can 't we try and find a way ? He seemed appeased by my offer To give him our bottled reserves . No ! We might need them . We can replenish from our wells . And when they go dry ? Have they ever ? Without rain ? Yeah , one day . Especially if gotta we share with those assholes . We share or we risk war . You think that 'll satisfy walker , huh ? You think they 'll take one drop and not want a gallon ? He 'll want everything . We could lose everything , dad , if we don 't meet him halfway . I 'd rather be dead than meet with that son of a bitch . And what about alicia ? Did you know he left my daughter behind With those- - those- - Savages ? Yeah , actually , I did know . And we got a lady in return . But I hear alicia volunteered . Guess the apple don 't fall far When it comes to pain-in-the-ass predicaments . She 's only 18 ! You know , in the old days , what , a couple of months ago , 18 was considered an adult . Even adults make decisions put themselves in danger . She 's not in danger as long as we honor the parley . What planet are you on ? I saw what happened at the outpost , What walker did at the outpost . There are things at play here you can 't fathom . You 're an outsider . You need to learn a little faith . What are you gonna do about this ? See if my son can placate . But you won 't negotiate . Madison , i would not piss in that man 's mouth If he was dying of thirst . Jake can make his play , But i can tell you right now , this parley ? Snakebit . Fake . Paper-mache . Tourists used to pay a couple of bucks to see it . But this ... Is not for tourists ' eyes . This is real . My great-grandfather . Shouldn 't he be buried ? He was . In a cave . I desecrated his grave to save it from the ottos and their fortune hunters . Generations trapped in this sideshow trailer ... Travesty . I hope one day my great-grandfather forgives me . When i can put all of this back . I was thinking the other day The idea of an afterlife doesn 't make sense . It 's so hard to get out of this life . It 's all part of a grand plan ... One that 's been taking place before the dead walked . Do you know what " apocalypse " means ? The end of the world . No . It means the great unveiling . When i started collecting relics to save them , I kept seeing a theme , in petroglyphs , Cave paintings , tanned hides . Prophecies of what we 're going through right now- - Dawn of a new age When the land will be shed of the impure . Impure , like the ottos . Like me . It 's been a long struggle , But it was foretold that we would not lose . After the apocalypse , all of this Will be returned to us , the first humans . Your friend ofelia 's either lying or very stupid . She 's her father 's daughter . She 's not stupid . If walker 's gonna take this place- - Try to . Try to ... She needs to be on what she thinks is the winning side . Shouldn 't that be our side , with you ? I mean , you have a connection . In her time with us , the world ended , her mother died , Her father went mad , burned to death . I 'd say ofelia 's for herself . Well , she 's standing by walker right now . 'cause she has reason . He 's violent , he 's brutal . She thinks he 's gonna beat us . I can 't let my daughter 's life be forfeit . I have to get alicia out of there now . Oh , no , jake says they 're heavily armed . You know ? And we can 't go demanding . This is not a conversation . We 'll just give the parley a couple days . Yeah ? Is that what you 'd do if you were running things ? No , I don 't think so . You , me , nick , a few of your guys , We slip in , we bring her back . Bring the whole tribe down on our head . And ? I mean , don 't you want that ? Jake 's calling the plays . You owe me . I could have brought the whole ranch down on your head . Help me do this . I thought , uh ... You and i should have a chat . I got nothing to say to you . Walker found you . That 's good . It 's good you 're not dead . Is it ? If this negotiation works , it 's good . Didn 't have to be me here . Could be anybody . What do you want ? I 've been thinking strange thoughts . Thinking on ghosts lately . It 's not your own sins that hold you , Haunting the earth and wandering in limbo . It 's the crimes others done to you . Somehow , they 're worse than the dead . The ghosts , they- - they carry your sins . What do you want ? Nobody wants war . Well , most . Let 's not complicate matters with old business . Fair ? Say it 's fair . It 's fair . I 'll have someone bring you in some food . I 'm not hungry . They 'll bring it anyway . stop , stop . I 'm trying to rescue you , okay ? Don 't scream . You 're gonna get us all killed . What are you gonna do to him ? If you kill him , i 'm not leaving . Nobody said anything about killing , okay ? Come on . All right . Let 's go , let 's go . No , you wouldn 't think twice About slitting his throat and letting him turn . I 'm about two minutes past caring what you think And about ready to leave you for the pigs . Shit , go , go , go , go , go . Go , go , go , go , go . What 's going on ? Someone 's coming . They 're not gonna make it . Bring the truck down and meet them . go , go , go , go , go . Behind the trucks ! They 're out behind the trailers ! Come on , i got you . Take them out ! Enemy fire ! Move it ! This way ! Move away , move away ! Move it , go , go ! Go , quick , quick , quick ! Move away ! All the way over ! We 've gotta move . Let 's go ! Come on , come on ! Congratulations , you just declared war on walker 's nation . Joe , call the patrols ! Watch for perimeter breaches ! They could be right behind you . They weren 't , and the mission was successful . We got the girl . I can 't believe this was your idea . You were in danger . Not till troy showed up and started killing people ! How many ? Eh , four , five . It wasn 't just troy . I convinced him . I made the call . You don 't make calls , madison . It 's not your place to make the call . I made a deal with that guy ! Against your father 's wishes ! To save all of us ! He played you ! Walker wasn 't gonna negotiate with you ! You never had anything ! There was nothing at stake except alicia 's life ! I told you this was jake 's show . It was the right call . Troy backed it . He believed . And bodies dropped , yeah ? Yes . A mystery why troy backed that call . Them that don 't listen Have to be brought to heel someday . Does dad know ? Dad 's drunk . Thought you 'd be happy I brought your girlfriend back . Tell me , how did madison convince you ? It was for her daughter . Even you 're not stupid enough to try and pull off what you did . You set off by yourself to walker 's camp . You 're doing it again now . What does your death wish look like ? See , i think you 'd be happy if walker took your scalp . I 'm gonna return ofelia . I 'm gonna reason with him . I 'm gonna placate him with the water . While i 'm gone , try not to kill anyone else , all right ? Brother . You leave , i don 't think you 're coming back . Ask yourself if that would make you happier . You don 't have to leave . You could stay . Or you could come with me . I wouldn 't stay here if i were you . Why ? What do you know , ofelia ? I did you wrong at the hotel . I put your life in danger . Come with me . That 's all i can offer . I can 't leave . You see that . Yeah . I 'm sorry about travis . Watch your fire ! There , they 've come back ! Kill him anyway ! Okay , let him breathe . You broke the parley , junior , stole the hostage , Killed my men , all because i trusted you . It was troy and the girl 's mother . It 's all the same . I brought you water and i returned your hostage . Not good enough . I promise you- - No . No more promises . I know i can still make peace . I know it . There will be peace , but not as you envisioned . The violence is almost over . Taqa . Tell your father i 'll finish the scalping Of his eldest son when i see him next . I will cut apart his youngest son And feed him to the hogs . Tell your father he will remain alive to watch this . Before we burn him alive . Safe travels . Action at the gate . Action at the gate . White flag , hold up . Bullshit ! Hold your fire , coop ! Walker thought I gave you information That got you onto the reservation when you took alicia . As if . What ? I think he means you really didn 't Seem to know much about their camp when we asked . All I know is I 've lost my home , Lost the people that took me in When I was left to die in the desert . You shouldn 't have left us . Take her out of here , okay ? Yes , sir . Tell joe to take her down to the infirmary . all right , let 's go . Now we can talk . So , what do you think ? No , walker won 't sit back now that we 've drawn fresh blood . His people will press for an attack . I can get more info out of her . No , she 's only in this situation because of me . It 's my fault . Back in la , I told her father I 'd look after her . I shouldn 't have let her go back . Well , she 's here now . So put her to work , watch her . She 's your charge . You can stay with alicia and me . We 'll have to find something for you to do . Worked the kitchen at black hat . Good , that 'll help . So , am i a prisoner here ? We 're all prisoners somewhere . You know , there 's no walls at walker 's place . He says it 's ' cause you can 't sneak up on an indian . Oh , well , they 've been lucky . Madison , alicia was never in trouble . She got a taste of freedom , and now it 's gone . For the both of us . Because of me . you saw that , right ? Okay , great , nobody sleeps for the next 48 . We should take the fight to them , man , not sit and wait for it . No fire on the ridgeline . Indians are holed up . I 'd say offense is the best defense . Yeah , well , that 's not what otto wants right now or jake . So , what happens if walker attacks While we 're on the perimeter ? Because it 's a long haul back to the ranch . Well , there 's only two roads he can use , And we 'll be on both of them with fast trucks . We stop him , we leave a suicide note , We fall back , and we defend the camp . Suicide note ? What ? One of our guys stays behind to fight to the end ? Well , yeah . Yeah . We 're all willing . Amen . No doubt . Mm-hmm . Well , if it does come to that , i 'll do it . You feeling blue , nicky ? No , i 'm just suicide-proof . Well , that 's , uh- - that 's well and good , But i think you 're gonna stay within the fence . You can go kamikaze another day . Is what walker did at the outpost worse Than what we 've done ? Yes . Trust me . Tore that man 's skull off while he was alive . Jake wasn 't shedding any tears for mccarthy . Jake didn 't see this . And i guess the trimbols That was bad , too . Yes . Worse in some ways . Mom , how can you be so sure it was walker who killed the trimbols ? Don 't like this . Do not like it one damn bit . You see shit ? If I see shit , You 'll be the first to know . Stay frosty . Joe , what 's up ? Something ain 't right , man . I - - I don 't feel- - Joe , what 's going on , brother ? Joe , joe , talk to me , man . What is this ? Joe , what 's going on , man ? Jesus , jesus . Medic , medic . now , medic ! Jesus , jesus , blake , what do i do , man ? ! Coop ! Coop ! turn on your side . Turn on your side . Mom . Jimmy , where you at ? Jimmy , it 's coop , man . We need you back at the camp . We need help over here ! We 're over at the south side bend , south side bend ! We need a medic ! stay inside ! Stay inside ! Go back home ! Get to your homes ! Stay inside ! Go back inside ! Get to your homes . Get back inside ! Get back inside ! Jesus , what the hell ? Help ! Help ! Let 's go , come on . Mom ! Mom ! You okay ? Yeah . Where 's alicia ? Alicia , you okay ? Yeah . Ofelia ! Ofelia ! Shit , stop her . What ? Ofelia , it was her . nick ? Nick ! Stay with him .

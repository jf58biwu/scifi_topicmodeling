After Chloe . Despite all of this shit . And ... to be honest , I ... I really admire that . - Thanks - You 've done really well . Okay ? Really . Inside ... get inside ! - Coming out ! - Let 's go back ! Let 's go back ! - It 's the rat . Look at the rat . - Early morning , all the guests are asleep as you can see .

After I got you guys out , I had to go back in and found a whole lot of layer of shit , I could tell you . And amongst all that , was where I found Pips . We tapped that white wall , ditch one . Sealed on the ground , by south London . - We were there two days ago . - You were there ? How was it ? - What is operation Ascalon ? - How was the base ? - It was destroyed . - We found a medic . Helen . - Why did you leave ? - Tell us about the medic . - Look . She wrote on the map , okay ? Before she died , she circled Manchester . - That 's not a circle . it 's an " O " . " O " for O-negative blood . The woman you found was a doctor . Her name was Helen . Helen believed that the bugs inject some sort of parasite into the bloodstream that gives them control over you . And O - negative blood stops the parasite from being able to do that . - What ? Kills it ? - Maybe kills it . But it definitely interrupts its ability to control you . - We have to go back ! - We can 't go back ! Your duty is to the mission . - Don 't you think we have a fucking right to know What the fuck is going on here ? With Ascalon ? - Ascalon . means fuck all to you , son , and you best remember that if you want to stay under my wing , go it ? - Every time I look at her face I just see death . - Um ... I need to talk to you about the blood . - I 'm a monster , Chloe . Not even Phil can save me now . - better charge this baby up . - 49 . - Twenty-minutes . - How could I have handled this without you , my friend ? - Chloe ? I need to speak to you . Somewhere else ? The blood ... it makes you an asset . Please don 't tell them . I 'm your big sister and we don 't even know them . It 's dangerous . - Oh , oh , I 'm sorry . I thought you didn 't have a little sister anymore . Remember ? - Chloe ! - See this ? it 's just a shell . That 's all it is . - They keep their books in a separate room , And they got it all the time . Could this be Ascalon ? - Let 's take a closer look , shall we ? - Get back ! Get back ! This is a restricted area ! What are you ... Connor ! - Get it off me ! Get it off me ! - Go ! Go ! - Close the door !

I mean , something is we made it through this far , then maybe we can all make it , mum . And then we could finally have that pizza . So here 's to hope . Love you . - We take dog tags from a person . Yeah ? Let 's have a look shall we ? Let 's have a look . - Oh , you see that ? That 's not john anymore , because that 's a bug hole . - I served in hell with him . You show some fucking respect ! Just say this , Ricky ! That could be you . Ammo .

Got me together a few times , I can tell you . - Are you using people ? Making bad decisions ? - Something like that . - Like not opening the box . What is Ascalon ? - Name of the lance Saint George used to kill the dragon . We salvaged one of their weapons from the first ship we brought down . - Is that what it is ? - They risk the last working chopper to bring it out . - Your boys didn 't seem too happy you didn 't use it . - Can 't risk it . It 's all we fucking got . Besides , we lost too many good men recovering that thing . Think I 'm gonna risk that ' cause they 're shitting their pants ? Anyway ...

 Essentially , genetic engineering is selecting the best of what we can be . Not tampering at all . But that 's what we 're talking about . If we were able to recode DNA , DNA that once altered , would pass its defenses permanently to its offspring , think of the health costs we could save if we had a read-out that showed when , I don 't know , our blood sugar levels were too high or sodium levels , or whatever . Businesses would save billions a year because employees wouldn 't need sick leave . Actually ... Maybe progress is bad . This is unorthodox . Friend of a friend 's Rumspringa . I thought you said he was a Quaker . Yeah , that 's what I said . Rumspringa 's Amish . We 're all doing kickstands ... One of my best friends ... ( Indistinguishable chatter continues ] Hey , can I get a beer ? Uh , yeah sure . Seth did you want it in your hands ? Umm , is there the option for a cup , or ? I mean , we had cups ... Um ... Well where 's your cup ? I 'm just in charge of distribution for tonight . The responsible one . Respect . Irregardless , it 's my lot in life . Ah , but irregardless means regardless , and there 's no such thing as the former . Ahahahah , holy shit . Uh , impressive . Hi . Hi . Seth . Em . Em ... Is that short for Emily ? Normal length for em , actually . This is , um , interesting music for a rite of passage party . What would make you think that was the case ? My friend , Rach , over there . Making out with six guys over there . Oh yeah , she 's very , uh ... Kind ... She 's a ... social ... Yeah , social ... Nice person . So is it Rach , or ... Rachel , actually . Nice to check in with that though . So what kind of music did you think we 'd be playing , like cat Stevens ? Yes , I love cat Stevens . Why isn 't there cat Stevens ? Now I 'm , now I 'm a little disappointed that there 's not cat Stevens . No , he 's great . I 'm more into like classical music . Pachelbel 's canon , stuff like that . The ... That 's the wedding song , right , the ... ? Yeah , yes , exactly . Very nice . I used to be able to play that on the piano when I was like , eight . And super grammar nerd , awesome . Nah , this is sort of just like a regular party with , like , good old farm boys . Farm boys . Jacob over there , he 's actually like a real Quaker . He 's even got like the lamb chops to prove it . Oh yeah ? And his name is Jacob . That 's Freakin ' perfect . So I gotta head back to my truck to ... Okay . Get another keg . It was nice meeting you . Um ... There might be more cups in the cab if you 're still interested . - Really ? - Yeah . Picture me rollin ' . Okay . Truck 's on . What next ? Okay , now by your left foot , there 's the parking brake . It 's kinda sticky . Okay , hold on . Ahaha , okay , wow . - That ? - Huh , uh , yes . 'Kay . Okay . Is your foot on the brake ? Mm hmm , we 're not rolling , are we ? No . Okay . All good . All right , now take your left foot and press down on the clutch . 'Kay . And put it into gear . All right . And now just release the clutch slowly and ... Lightly tap on the gas . Hahahaha shit . I 'm sorry . Oh , no sweat . I should probably get back with the keg anyways . But uh , yeah , thanks . I said sorry . No , I mean thanks for hangin ' out with a fellow teetotaler tonight . It was fun , even if it was just for a short time . Well maybe we can extend it to another day . Yeah , I have , uh , class a lot , but the weekend would work . What 's , uh , what 's your cell ? I don 't have one . I have a land line , with protruding buttons and stuff . Wow . Here . You can write it down with this antiquated gadget . I call a pen . Oh , you don 't have a quill or anything ? Uh , no . It 's way too messy . Thank you . Yeah . I 'll bring a cat Stevens tape for your fancy tape deck . Hi , this is em . Em , it 's me . Or , uh , Seth from the other night . Hi , I didn 't know if I 'd hear from you or not . I have to cancel our plans this Saturday . Okay . My dad , he , he had a stroke . Oh my god . Are you all ... Is there anything I can do ? Are you all right ? I don 't think so . My mom 's having a tough time , so ... I 'm so sorry . Jesus , um ... Look , I lost my mom when I was little , so if there 's anything you want to talk about . Okay , um , we 're praying for a good recovery . Listen , I gotta go . The doctor 's out now . He just wants to chat with me and mom . Okay . Thanks bye . Whazzup . Disen-fucking-Gage dude ! Just a second ! You bitch ! You 're missing actual life . You ready to go home now ? I 'm so ready . [ Followed by somber strings ) Mixed with somber music hi . Hey , I 'm sorry . It 's just it 's been a long , long day . My mom had me do a bunch of stuff for her . Coulda ' texted . Forgot to turn the damn thing on again . Have you even used it once since I got it for you ? Has she thought any more about selling the farm ? I don 't know where she 's at with that , em . Like I don 't think she 's in the right place for that right now . I , I mean she probably just thinks it 's disloyal to my dad . Well , but it 's not . It wouldn 't be giving up . You 're gonna kill us . Thought about , you know , doin ' anything else ? Bills first . Then figure out how to conquer the world . Unless you 're insinuating I go to school with you . Get me one of them higher educations . Yeah . I 'm gonna have all of my pieces end up here eventually . Nice . You shake it harder , you get bigger numbers . Oh , I 'll have to try that . I was thinking of going to seminary . It 's kinda something my , parents always wanted for me . I mean that was the plan ... Before . Ouch . Mid-move even . Can 't believe you 're telling me this in a seedy hotel room . A seedy hotel this is like our go-to . In the middle of some Podunk town . This is right in between us . Like what , you want to go back to your , your place and do this with your roommate like two feet away ? She might want next game . Your turn . You just gonna shut off every time this comes up ? Hmmm ? Stop . Come on . Hey , mister ! You know if my mom saw those ... Yeah . What 's , what 's with you tonight ? What 's with you ? You 're picking on me . I am ? No , I 'm crazy about you . And your star tattoos . Now you 're making fun of me ? I 'm not making fun of you . I 'm crazy about you . So you still going back to , going back home for ... For holiday break ? Unfortunately . I feel like I should . At least be a sport . You could come with me , unless you have to ... Yeah , I probably shouldn 't . I don 't know , I just want everything to run smooth through Christmas . It 's only like two weeks , right ? I just feel like my dad barely knows I 'm there . You know , like ever since my mom died he 's all about work and we just barely talk . He sends checks to school . I go home for holidays . We check those boxes . Probably keeps him going though . Enjoys his time . It 's good of you to see him . It sucks losing a parent . I think god provides . Well , aren 't you cute ? I don 't know what I 'm doing . You a college student ? Sorry ? You guys on your winter break ? Yeah , headed home for the holidays . You know when I was in school , we didn 't ... I said when I was in school , we didn 't have all the breaks that you guys have . No ? No , we had , we had , Christmas break . I guess now it 's called holiday break , huh ? Mmhm . Well , even with all the breaks , I 'll still be doing plenty of studying . Not too much . You have some fun too , you hear ? My hands are too antiquated for those new machines . Oh look at , arthritic and fat fingers , like a bear paw . Just blame it on the auto correct . On the what ? The auto correct . You know , when it tries to ... I , I don 't know what that means , but hell , I 'll take it . Okay . You are a cutie . Mmmm ... I 'll go over to the hospital administrator for her release to us then . I told the boy . Boy ? Her boyfriend . She had a boyfriend ? Has , Roy . She has . What 'd you tell him ? It was me . I told Sofia to tell him to say his goodbyes . Goodbyes ? - As far as he knows . - You know man , for closure . Well , couldn 't you just have told him visiting hours are over ? You see , this is why you have me do these things . It 's probably appropriate that Sofia did it . She 's a lot more diplomatic than you are , Hank . I know I can be a rough around the edges . Excuse me ... Hello ? Hold on a second . Hey guys , she 's my daughter , okay ? Good to go . I just really hope what we 're doing is the right thing , Hank . Hope isn 't a plan , Roy . And what we 're doing is putting her in the best position to survive . Janie was the glue . After she died , I didn 't know how to raise em . I was a shitty father . I love em . You know I do . I 've know her since what , since she was three years old . And I remember how it was with Janie . And I 'm gonna do everything in my power to help you bring em back and give her a long and healthy life . Unhhh , goddammit , let there be light . I thought we made the decision by bringing her here . - Hey , Phillip , what 's goin ' on ? - I got my mom in the truck . We just got back from seeing my dad . - Geez , Louise , that 's just ... - It 's been a tough year for you . Yeah , it 's been a rough one . Look , I wanna thank you for your help . I know my mom ... She appreciates it too . Well , you think about what I said , okay ? I just sort of feel responsible to make an offer , you know , given as how your dad was so good to me when I was getting started farming . I tell ya , I wouldn 't have been nearly as successful without his guidance . I , I don 't see how you gonna be able to run this place all by yourself . Aagh , I don 't know , I ... It 's just I think my mom will want to hold on to the farm , if we can . Not that we don 't appreciate your help . No , hey , hey , no , don 't feel bad about it . You guys could stay here . I could use the expansion to be honest with you . I really could . We 'd have to clean things up around here though . I mean , this place , it 's seen better days , that 's for sure . I mean seriously , we need a yard sale or somethin ' . " Cause I got , you know , I got a vision for this here . This could make an awesome , uh ... Well you just think about it . Yeah , I don 't ... Take your time . Don 't , don 't go lookin for rats in the attic . Alright , take care of your mom , all right ? Yeah . I know you will . Yeah . I know you will . - We 're gonna be all right . - We 'll be fine . Even if we weren 't , it 's not like that would be my fault , since dad sort of left us in financial shambles . What ? Okay . Never go to bed on your anger , right ? That 's what you 've always said . I 'm sorry . Have a good night , all right , mom ? Love ya . Music simplifies as it drifts away ... ] I feel like we 're stuck at the beginning with her , Roy . What happened the other night ? Did you ever go home ? - Oh , it 's a nightmare . - Perfectly common , right ? You know ... same thing happened with the soldiers . I feel like I 'm in grade school . Let 's be honest . She 's not progressing the way we want her to . What is it exactly that we do want , Hank ? Better sandwiches . Come on . All right . I 'm just sayin ' , the board would like to see some improvement . Yeah , I 'm just trying to improve my daughter . I guess I should be trying to improve P / E ratios . I meant improving the way they were thinking . Oh , the way they were thinking ? Oh , relax . I want what 's best for em too . Uh huh . Keep in mind we 're under significant pressure prove our worth . To prove that all these years of research and development have not been in vain . We have profits to meet or we 'll lose our subsidies . Now em is in a prime spot for us ... Prime spot . Life at all costs . Is that it Hank ? Last time I checked , I made this happen . I 'm overseeing this . She 's not a lab rat . No one 's thinking that . Relax . She 's ... She 's my daughter . Yes , and I 'm appealing to you as your friend , on behalf of her . She 's suffering and I think it 's halting her progress . Okay . So ? Hear me out . She has classic signs of PTSD . I know . We 've given her medication for that . But they 're not working , so I think her condition , her suffering , is keeping her from moving beyond the accident . From further developing . Now we saw it before . If we can block those memories ... we saw in prior cases , they would jump light years ahead . How can you call those experiments successful ? That was year 's ago . We , we can dial it in . We can pinpoint this . All right , so yes , I am for life at all costs . I don 't mean to be cold here , but all this being emotional it 's hurting her . Maybe you need to relinquish control to me . Let me oversee it . I can easily vacillate between what 's good for em , and what 's good for singularity . And I 'll handle it with kid gloves . Now we say to our colleagues all the time , we have to remain objective to yield the best results . Now we 're 99 percent of the way there . All we need is one little nudge . This is your opportunity to do what you couldn 't do for your wife . Over the course of the last two years , we 've had to make some alterations so that you would survive what would have been by normal standards , a fatal crash ... Adaptations . A neuro chip implanted in your brain to replace the non-recoverable damage . Most of your functioning and memory are , for what we know , still intact . Your left eye was blinded , so we replaced it with an artificial optic that connects to your brain implant . It will not only restore your vision , but should enhance it . Additional adaptations including synthetic organ replacement to your right lung , part of your stomach and both kidneys . Nanobot injections were given to replace much of your red blood cells and to coincide with what remains . As a result ... We should not only restore your body 's faculties to full capacity , but also enhance and potentially prolong your life . Like a computer , this new technology will enable you to instinctively know the shortest possible routes between locations . Much like a bee 's amazing navigational skills , there will be no wrong turns . No second guessing . Your very own internal GPS . Those are pre-augment scars . They 'll likely never go away , but they 'll fade with time . You wanna get out of here , I know that . You need to . You just have to , uh , give me some time and then we 'll re-evaluate . If it were up to me , you 'd be outta here tomorrow , but that 's not my decision . Dad ? Did ... Give it time , em . Ma 'am ? Whoa , whoa ! You Seth ? Yeah , well she 's not . I 'm with the bank , regarding your mortgage . I just need you to sign this . Can you put the gun down , please ? It 's a rifle . For vermin . 'Kay . You know , you guys can 't bury my dad any deeper . It 's a final notice on your farm . Sorry about this , but you 're delinquent over a year now . I just need you to sign this . That you received this . We 've been calling . You guys don 't have a machine or anything ? Who do I talk to about an extension ? Jordy ? Sorry about that . Here you go . Here . Why didn 't Jordy come tell me ? You talking about Jordan Chamberlain ? Yes , the same guy who gave us the extension last time . You , you 'd have to speak with him about that . I 'm with special credits . I 'm only sent out when it 's time to , you know , act . Regulations . Thank you . Yeah , speak with Jordan if you have any issues and , uh , go ahead and keep that pen , okay ? Who was that joker that was at my house this morning ? Like I thought the extension was still good ... That was before he passed . We still extended you last time . Let me ask , what 's going on with the farm subsidies that you applied for ? Yeah , that would have been nice , huh ? We had no problems getting subsidies when I was growing up , before he passed , but now suddenly I 'm getting the run around . Hell , I had a friend that lost his farm because they wanted to build cell towers or something . So , that 's not a viable option , I take it , getting a subsidy . Look , I just , I ... I need more time . Maybe an extension . I 've given up everything I have to sit there and try to make this work . Why ? What 's gonna change ? You , you tell me . I 'm just the pilot here , Seth . I didn 't build the plane , and I don 't control the weather . I just ... With or without your dad , your film is still hurting . He was sitting across from me , just like you are . Yeah , except he was sitting across from someone older than you , before you were here . Someone that knew how to make a deal based upon a promise and a handshake . What 's this ? Calm down , Seth . He 's just checking in . We 've already made the decision . If you can 't come up with the back payments , we 're gonna have to take the next step . You just killed my mom , then . Thank you . - Hey , Seth . How you doin ' ? - I know you 're upset . Hey , don 't beat yourself up , you know ? There 's really not a whole lot else you coulda ' done . I tell ya , these family farms are getting , they 're just getting replaced by the big factory farms . There 's just no way we can keep up with that kind of production . Hey . It 's no wonder we can 't pay our bills , right ? You seem to be doing fine . Well yeah , today , maybe , but what about tomorrow ? You just remember , I got your back , all right ? And you 're gonna be way better off having me own that farm than uncle Sam . And I 'm just holdin on to it for you til you get on your feet again , right ? Usual hot water in a mug , 140 degrees with honey ? You got it , Amber . Oh , oh Amber ? Uh , what are you having , Seth ? I 'm buying . Oh , no , I 'm not hungry . Come on , you sure ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Amber , you got any of that good chili ? Three alarm ? Yeah . Yeah get him a bowl . If he don 't eat it , I will . God , I love this place . It 's just the way things should be . Is there something else bothering you ? When I was looking for the deed tonight , I kinda came across my old girlfriend 's obituary . Oh man , I 'm sorry . Yeah . How 's her family gettin ' on ? None really to speak of , except for , I mean , except for her dad . Have you talked to him ? Uh ... We never really knew each other . Plus , I don 't really think I 'm his cup of tea , you know ? Well why is that ? Farm boy , Phillip . He 's like some big wig bio tech guy . Thank you , Amber . So hot water and honey , huh ? No coffee or tea ? Nope . I don 't need no artificial stimulants . Not me . I don 't think caffeine 's artificial . Don 't be a smart ass . You know what I 'm talkin ' about . So , bio tech , huh ? Where 'd you say he worked ? Singularity . Are you kiddin ' me ? No . You know what they do there ? Those are them guys that are doing all that , that crazy ... Look ... Listen , em and I , you know , we didn 't see eye to eye on that . I told her I thought that they pushed the envelope too much . Yeah . Pushed it right into the devil 's mailbox , if you ask me . Did I ever tell you about these meetings I attend ? What , like , like aa meetings ? No ... No . It 's , it 's a different kind of group . Um , in fact I was gonna ask you if we could hold our meeting at your barn , you know ? Sure , yeah . You know , irregardless of whether or not you sign the deed over to me or not . Yeah , you see , we just want to keep a low profile . I 'll tell you all about it later . I just , you know , didn 't want to overwhelm ya . Uh , but speaking of the deed , though , can I take a look ? Right . It 's gonna be fine , Seth . And you and your mom , you can be caretakers . Stay there as long as you need to . How is she doin ' ? Plant 's looking healthy . Can you write something for me ? Come with me . I think I can 't really see you . In a computer , I can open it up , see every resistor , every wire , every part in it . But I couldn 't tell you about its behavior . You see , the hardware is simply where the software resides . To understand the behavior , you have to understand the software . And the software has no mass . Jimmy , I can 't stay here . Who 's Seth ? Let 's get you something to eat . All right ? How you doin ' ? Did you love mom ? Of course I did . Why would you say that ? What 's up ? Seems like you spent more time with her after she got sick than before . That 's not true . I was there , dad . We were trying to figure things out . Just like you are , em . Can 't underestimate this set back . Our minds have limits . They 're fixed . We 're fucked . Hers ? She 's advancing even beyond our wildest dreams . Do you know how many lives we can save with that notion ? This has exceeded every expectation . I was just under the impression that this was all gonna end at some point . I have to be honest with you , as your friend . The board feels like you 've forgotten your duties here . Your research . Singularity 's objective G , N , R. Genetics , nanotechnology , robotics . Humans have rationalized , even made excuses for death . Somehow it 's noble . But it is our job to term death as a tragedy . A tragedy of lost intelligence , of lost relationships . Therefore , it is our job to extend life . Period . Oh just spare me the diatribe . It 's yours , man . And I think you need a reminder . We are on the precipice of changing human evolution . We won 't have to worry about death . We can swap out these suboptimal bodies and engineer ourselves to be gods . But don 't you ever have a hint of doubt ? Ever ? Now clearly she 's not the same em . But she is not my little girl , em . We make better humans . And she 's the first step . Em ! And look at that . You 're just stronger . No . Times are tough . What 's the matter , Russ ? We either move to the Mountainsor off the grid or we take that alternative stance . And when our stuff gets taken away ... Right , Renee ? When our stuff gets taken away , that 's when we 're tested . I don 't know , folks . I don 't know . But this decision is not mine . I am not the driving force here , okay ? It 's all of us . We all are in this together , right ? I thought it best that we come here . Look ... Em , look , am I , um ... Are we , are we in any trouble ? I have your obituary at my house . At least I thought ... I thought , I thought I did . I was taken to my dad 's ... facility . Singularity . You know about it ? There was some nurse or lady ... There was someone ... She was at the hospital when I went to go say my goodbyes . She said that she worked for your dad . She wasn 't very informative , except ... Yeah , this was it . It almost was . My dad thought his lab was my only chance . And I , um ... Two years feels like two weeks to me . There 's been a lot of physical therapy and I 'm starting to get my memory back . You just remember us now ? Shit ! I don 't understand , like , why the ... Why the funeral ? Why ... ? What did they do to you ? Seth . Seth . Shit . Come on . Yeah , he was pretty proud of that . You hungry ? I 'm sorry I made , I made scrambled by default 'cause they 're less hard to screw up . Was the bed comfy ? It was fine , thank you . I 'm just gonna run these out to my mom real quick . I 'll be right back . Alright mom , it 's time to eat . I 'll be back to check on you , all right ? Are you gonna eat ? No . Why are you here ? I had nowhere else to go . You 're confusing to me , em . I don 't ... I 'm not ... I 'm not saying that I don 't want you here . It 's just I feel like half the time , ya ain 't . If that makes sense . So is someone looking for you then ? Listen , I ... The whole thing about it , it 's just got me paranoid . I don 't know what to say , like I 'm part of this , this group . It 's called the 144 . It represents the forty-four families in this community that lost their livelihood to factory farming . And the one is just , you know , under one god , it 's just a funky name that we gave it . Look , basically , these people are a group of Luddites . I 'm part of them . It 's around the country . It 's big . But we were talking about ... Remember when we talked about what your dad did for a living , like before your accident . It 's like even you said that he was into some pretty advanced stuff . Like how do we How do we know that you 're not some experiment to see how far they can push technology ? Em ! Em ! Wait ! What ? What am I to you , the sum of my parts ? No , no , no , no , no , no . No ? You think I wanted this ? Okay , listen , I 'm sorry ! All right ? I just , I ... I can 't lose you again ! Listen , you show up back in my life and everything just got so fucked . And I 'm sorry I 'm still trying to process this , but ... I ... I ... I need you to stay . No , I want you to stay . Please don 't leave . I 'm sorry for everything that 's happened to you . No , I 'm sorry . I 'm ... So sorry . Oh ! Em ! What the hell are you doing ? Ohh . - Come here . - Ohh . Just keep your hand under there . Can I see your hand ? Let us pray . Lord , be with us here tonight . Allow your words to guide us and give us the courage we need to stand firm in our beliefs . Give us the strength , lord , to face these troubling times head on . These things we ask in Jesus ' name . Amen . Amen . Well where are we , folks ? Where are we ? It 's time to wake up . And figure out what 's most important to us . And how this so-called progress is affecting ' our lives . Not only our lives , but the lives of our patriots . It 's time we get off our ass . I apologize . Let 's just put this another way . - Jeremiah 1 : 17 . - Get yourself ready . Stand up and say to them whatever I command you . Do not be terrified by them , or I will terrify you before them . That 's not me talkin ' folks . That 's god . Oh , wow . I didn 't even know places like this existed anymore . It 's paradise . My mom 's doing so much better ... thanks to you . I don 't know about that , but I 'm glad . Thank you . Well , it 's great being with you , so ... It 's easy . Oh . I gotta get the picnic stuff . Okay . You 're shaking . Yeah . Are you scared of me ? No . Em ? Seth ? Now we need to act now , or we don 't act at all . It 's just a report . It doesn 't mean that it 's the mark of the beast . So , how 's this thing go ? Is it this way or that way ? Pvt. Huey Durmont my name is Huey Durmont . E-2 e-2 , no you have to , you have to say what that is . Sorry . Private first class . Um , part of the 47th chromosome project . I see . It 's definitely one step closer to that , that jumpin ' Jesus we 've all be talkin ' about . You could say that about every single moment of every single day . Look , I 'm not defending technology , but you 're wrong if you think that I 'm somehow undecided about this , because I 'm not . But what are we , some terrorist group ? I uh , had a neuro chip implant . I lost control of myself . Shot ... My best friend during a combat training regimen . Tattoos . For every man , woman , and child . Required . Required ! Forced through some kind of mandatory enrollment . Now that is the very definition of a mandate . Now , I don 't know about you , but that doesn 't sound too innocent to me . I 'm not claiming , I 'm not claiming that it 's innocent . All right ? What I 'm saying is that maybe it 'd be better to walk away than engage in a war . What about the mountains , like you said ? Go on . Uh , I now believe I was not controlling my thoughts , arms , or hands . I was a husband and a father . I don 't have them anymore . I was moved to a privately funded institution and ... I can 't do this . I can 't do what you asked me . Uh , now how , how ' bout what , what do you got there ? What is that ? Viruses can be manufactured and used with the public none the wiser . And the worst part is here ... Here . Now hold it closer so we can see it . There ya go , yeah . Yeah , this is a capsule that was detected by a spectrograph . It 's uh , it 's broken so not to worry . Uh , it could kill a lot of people within a hundred-yard radius . Look , man , I love you . You know I do . Your dad was good to me . Can you tell us the name of the private facility ? Singularity . But I 'm afraid your time with this girl is clouding your judgement . That has absolutely nothing to do with this . Yeah , well I know who she is . And I know you 've been hiding her from us . Trying to keep us from knowing the truth about her . Can I have a room ? Please ? Daddy ? It 's an RFID chip . They were able to track this . So I just wanna make sure . If they were tracking me , why didn 't they pick me up before now ? I was able to convince them to hold off . See how you did out there . Out there ? The real world . Your mother wanted me to focus on you . And I didn 't . I 'm sorry . The truth is that you 're so much like her . I was , anyway . No , you , you are like her . You are very much like her . You still are . I blame myself for not being able to save her . The ... Technology wasn 't there for me to do anything about it , but I still blame myself . Because ... My business is doing the impossible . Such bullshit . She never wanted what I wanted . I know . She got so sick all she really wanted was peace . And the only thing she felt really terrible about , was leaving you behind . How do you feel about Seth ? Why ? I 'm afraid he could be in danger . I 'm afraid anyone that comes in contact with you , they may see as a threat . I 've got your passport in the back . Change of clothes . We 're going to Canada . And Seth ? Fuck . Thank you . Okay , you 're close . Go get him . I gotta ... Few things to take care of and then I 'll catch up with you , okay ? You be safe . I love you . You get goin ' , okay ? I love you too . May I help you ? I 'm looking for em . She ain 't here . I 'll come back then . Seth ! Oh , god ! No ! Oh , baby . Oh , shit ! Of course you don 't have your phone ... Right ? It 's okay , I 'm gonna go get us help , okay ? Okay . Let 's go . What do you want , Hank ? You know , I wanted to give you an opportunity to put all this in motion . I need good people out there campaigning for the cause . You know , sort of integration . So I 'll give you a chance to repent for your sins , Roy . And you 'd be a great contribution on your part if you volunteered that . Are you too lost at this point ? Lost ? What 's white is black and vice versa . Huh , Hank ? What 're you , gestapo now ? You really think we don 't know what 's going on ? And you were right . Of course . Sending her out here by herself was the best thing we could have done for her . You 're a genius even when you 're not trying . It 's a damn shame . What the hell are you talking about ? We see everything , Roy . So , you can tell us . Don 't tell us . It doesn 't matter . It 's just a chance for redemption . You better not hurt her , Hank . Why would I hurt em ? We just want her back , that 's all . We 're partners ! When did you ever treat me like a partner ? Anyway , the board deems you unfit . I 'm just sad you lost your way . You know I gotta thank you . It 's a great testament to your good work . She has exceeded all known biological capabilities . It 's a miracle , right ? I used to agree with you . A week ago , I might have agreed with you . But I 've been wrong . We just can 't change features or a feature and not think that there 's not going to be consequences . And we can 't just arrogantly think that we can transcend thousands of years of an experience . Yeah , I don 't know if there 's a god . I don 't . I 'm a confused and bitter man , Hank . But , I have to admit that I 've been longing for something like nanotech or artificial intelligence to take us to that next level , you know ? To ... To something beyond that even I could articulate . I know you 're just trying to buy time . We don 't need you to find her . I just needed a way to get you to buy in . You understand ? Thank you . Hank . You did a great job . Everybody at singularity thanks you . Hank . Listen , I 'm not gonna make it to the hospital . You gotta pull over , baby . Just pull over . Okay . Stay with me . Let me take you to the hospital . I know where I need to go , okay ? No . Stay . I can 't . Come on . We have to go , okay ? Okay . Please . I 'm here , wherever you want . Wherever you want . Okay . Okay . Sweetie , we 're here . We 're here . Hey , we 're here . It 's paradise .

 My name is Kiera Cameron , and I came here from the year 2077 . Evolution is on our schedule . The war begins now . Emily , it 's ok . I love you , too . Emily ! I have to accept the truth . That I may never get back to him . That doesn 't mean I have to stop trying . That 's all I 've ever wanted . To put the pieces back together and return to my family . I 'm sorry , Kiera . Alec , I can go home ! I know . But I have to save her . Emily , I travelled through time for you . You . I choose you . So I guess we 're not gonna be pals then , huh ? I don 't see how . There are two Alec Sadlers . He made the time device work . He traveled back to change things and created another timeline . This one . That 's what created the ultimate future that this guy comes from . Travelers lead , let 's knock all the dominos down . When things get too hairy , I want you to use this . Alright , let 's let the big man himself send you off . Sir . You want to cheat death , Kellogg ? Help me , and I 'll teach you how . I 'm just a cog in the machine now , Carlos . I don 't get to play chess master anymore . Somehow I doubt that . That was yesterday . She is a heartbreaker . You are under arrest for the attempted murder of Alec Sadler . This timeline isn 't big enough for the both of us . I couldn 't agree more . I have been getting the other Alec to sign documents that remove him and put me in the big chair . This will send a signal . If nobody hears it , nothing happens . And if someone does hear it ? Then we 've failed . Mr. Sadler is dropping all charges . Right . All yours . [ Giant magnetic pulse ] You did it . Thank you so much , Carlos . We really appreciate it . Good . You can reciprocate by getting Piron to support my department 's requests now that it 's finally in the hands of a sane person . Alright , what happened ? Kellogg happened . He tricked other me into turning over control of the company to him . I 've been kicked out . [ Chuckles ] Why am I not surprised ? I wonder what the future will hold . Isn 't it nice to wonder ? Yeah , it is . What do we do now ? Run ! What are you doing ? You keep going , I 'll try to slow them down . What ? ! They 're my people , they 're not gonna hurt me . I 'll contact you as soon as it 's safe . You better . Oh , shit ! Woah , hey , hey ! Tonkin , out of my way . Hey , guys . ( Marcellus ) : Weaver take point . Rollins flank while Vasquez provides cover ! Zorin , status ? ( Zorin ) : I 've got our six . Track has gone , I 've lost the signal . Target is back . [ gunfire ] 10 seconds , I 've got inbound police . ( Marcellus ) : Close the net . Oh , shit . Officer Cameron . Where am I ? You 're in CPS Med Bay Nine . What 's the day ? September 25th . The year ? 2080 . Have Officer Cameron 's family notified she 's awake . Family ? You 've been asleep for three years . Welcome back , Kiera . Ã  ♪ I don 't remember anything . You were admitted with dozens who were injured in the execution chamber explosion . The terrorist attack ? Liber8 ? It doesn 't matter . We initiated a controlled coma so that we could operate and spare you some of the recovery discomfort but for some reason we couldn 't wake you up . We knew it was just a matter of time before you came back to us . Is there something you want to tell me ? I had these vivid experiences , as real as anything . More than a dream . I ... I can remember all of it . I understand . It makes perfect sense . You see , your CMR was designed to activate realistic simulation program when brain trauma has been detected . Mom ? Sam ? Oh ... Oh . I missed you so much . I missed you , too . You have some catching up to do . I 'll be right outside . Look at you . Look at you . I can 't believe it 's you . I 'm scared to touch you . I can 't believe you 're back . I 'm so sorry I left , I didn 't want to , I didn 't mean to . It 's not your fault . I missed you . I missed you every day . I should have been there for you and ... and I wasn 't . It 's ok . Everything is ok . It 's not ok . It 's not ok . Look at you ! This emotional stress is becoming a concern . What are you doing here ? I 'm here to calm you down . Kiera , I 'm so pleased to see you back . You 've done an excellent job . You 've changed the past . You saved the future . Mom ? Sam ? Sam ! Kiera ? Kiera ? Kiera , are you ok ? Kiera ! Sam ! Sam ! Are you ok ? It 's Alec . Sam ! It 's Carlos and Alec . Come on . No , no , no . He was just ... he was just here . You 're fine , you 're safe , you 're alive . I 'm ok , I 'm ok . Kiera , you are hallucinating . My CMR goes into simulation mode in the event of head trauma . Come on . I 'm ok , I 'm ok . We 've got it from here , thanks . What the hell happened ? I don 't know . What did happen ? All I know is patrol came across some heavily armed perps . They snuck their way out of the area and they escaped . We 're trying to get a location on them but we 're a little short on details . Ok . Get her out of here , take her some place safe . Sure thing . I want you in my office first thing tomorrow . Marcellus ? Tonkin . You look surprised to see me . I didn 't expect to see you pulling this duty . After you left , things got worse . We moved everything up . Rollins , Nolan . You know Vasquez . Weaver , and Zorin . What happened with your aim ? What do you mean ? Your mission was locate timers and neutralize them . Things got complicated . Hmm . I saw you with her , Brad . Cameron . She 's on the target list . What were you doing with her ? Nice place . Who 's is it ? It 's mine , apparently . Right . The other me , dead me , grabbed the brass ring with both hands . Paid in cash . Alec ? We need to talk . Ok . I came to a realization . What 's that ? I accomplished my mission . Stopped Liber8 , prevented whatever future they might have built , and I made sure you will never build the broken future that I came from . That was the reason for sending me back , wasn 't it ? Apparently . It 's time for me to focus on myself . What I want . What exactly are you talking about , Kiera ? Longing . Desire . It caught me a little by surprise . I want to go home , Alec . And I need you to send me . What are you schemers scheming ? Revenge . Payback . Uh , she doesn 't know . What don 't I know ? After you left me at Piron , Kellogg played his ace card . I got the boot and he 's taken control . I 'm trying to get my company back . Alec has a plan to make Kellogg pay . And make it hurt . It 's the hurting part that concerns me . How 's that coming ? We 've hit a few road blocks . It 's nothing I can 't handle . What about our conversation last night ? That 's exactly what I 'm doing . How do you figure ? In order to get you - where you need to go , I need very specialized technology . The one person who currently possesses that very rare technology to get you back to your future is - Kellogg . Kellogg . Mr. Kellogg ? Curtis Chen is here for you . Thank you , Jacqueline . You 're doing well . It 's not by accident . What can I do for you , Curtis ? It 's what I can do for you , Kellogg . Is this about my future ? It always is . Ok , look . Before you spellbind me with some hokey temporal religious nonsense , let me cut to the chase . Right now I don 't really see the advantage of aligning myself with you and your friend . I 'm not saying it 's not a possibility ... eventually , I just need to get the lay of the land first , you know ? Before I make any important decisions . How will you know ? Excuse me ? If they 're important , the decisions . See , that 's where I come in . I can let you know in advance which decisions are key to protecting your future and which decisions are not . Think of the traveler as a road map . Hmm . A map to this grim future where I 'm some warlord leading an army . Not the future . Right now . Your foot soldiers are here in this time . I can help you use them , push their actions . Push the timeline in the right direction . The right way . I 'm still gonna think about it . It 's your prerogative , of course . But one way or another , your destiny will catch up with you and bring you back to me . To us . Then I have something to look forward to . Now if you 'll excuse me , I 've got some business to attend to . Of course . Interesting night . Uh , yeah . You could say that . Between the power outage and street warfare , I 'm guessing more Liber8 activity . I 'm worried it 's a new faction . Based on what ? Solid intel . Provided by Kiera Cameron ? There 's CCTV security footage of her with members of Liber8 . Working with them . Uh huh . Kiera 's managed to infiltrate Liber8 . She 's gathering intel that should lead to some high-profile arrests . That 's quite the promise . More of a hopeful prediction . I want results . Not predictions . Copy that . Oh , did you hear about Dillon ? What ? Doctors cleared him . He 'll be out any day . I can go back to being a detective . I wouldn 't throw away that sport coat just yet . Word on the street is he 's done with the force . Jesus Christ . I never took you for a religious man . Do you realize the position that you put me in ? I promise this is the last time you 'll ever have to cover for me . What are you talking about ? Nothing . I just want to protect you and the department in any way that I can . I 've caused enough damage . Literally and figuratively . Are you ok ? Yes . Ok . So why don 't you tell me what happened last night ? Brad wanted to see if we had prevented Kellogg 's dark future . Unfortunately , proof that we failed showed up in the form of six heavily armoured soldiers . And where are they now ? I don 't know . And Brad ? I haven 't seen him since last night . I 'm hoping that he might be working them from inside . Might be ? I 'm worried . Alright , we gotta figure out where these soldiers are and what they 're planning . Target Kellogg . They 're connected to him and whatever he 's cooking up in that twisted mind of his . Kellogg , as in my new overlord ? Same guy . It 's not gonna be as easy as it sounds . Kellogg has consolidated a lot of power and money , and his influence in this department shouldn 't be underestimated . Piron still holds the purse strings around here . I 'm sure you can find a way around that . Well , I 'm still a cop , Kiera . I 've got to follow the rules . But you could get me something concrete that I can arrest Kellogg on and we could share the load . Partner . Ok . I will work on nailing his ass , but it might be fun to shake the tree first . And what did you have in mind ? So which one are you ? The good one . I think you 'd both say that . I 'm the only one . Then how good are you ? How much do you know ? Sonya told me a little bit . Brought some other things together . Your future , mine . Who are those guys ? Political activist friends . They look serious . They are serious . About making change . Outsmart your enemy . Don 't make yourself a target . Embed , disrupt from the inside . This is serendipitous . That 's what I came to talk to you about . I 'm listening . Do you still have your employee access card to Piron . They haven 't fired me yet . Yet . That 's good . Maybe that change that you 're talking about , maybe we can make it together . Laying low ? The protector might be our friend for the moment , but she still works for a system that wants to bring us down , Lucas . We have to start thinking about survival and disappearing . You have an update ? Yeah , but uh ... you 're not gonna like it . It seems like all that effort we put into switching Alec Sadlers at the Halo launch event was for nothing . Kellogg 's pulled a fast one and arranged to have the kid removed from his company . He 's holding all the cards now . Kellogg controlling Piron . That can 't be good for us . I 'll tell Travis . There 's more . There 's some kind of temporal event connected to Kellogg 's future . What 's the protector doing about it ? It 's unclear . Why is that ? Kiera is protecting Brad . They 're his people . Then we can 't trust her . Are you sure you thought this through ? Completely . So finally I say to the guy " if I can 't land a helicopter on it , " what 's the point of buying it ? " [ Laughs ] Excuse me , ma 'am , this is a private party . Invited guests only . Aaaegh ! That never gets old . Um , excuse me . This won 't take a minute . Carlos ! What a surprise , I don 't remember your name on the guest list . Yours , however , is always on the guest list . I 'm flattered . I 'm here on business , Kellogg . Oh . Why don 't you tell us what happened with Alec . Which one are you referring to ? Don 't be a dick . What are you up to ? Business . Just like Carlos . Look , from where I was standing , the other Alec was a problem . He was a shithead , to be frank . You knew it , I knew it . I just took care of the situation in my own creative way . Fine . Then give the Piron keys back to the Alec who isn 't a problem . I 'd love to , but the board doesn 't know what we know and it might be a hard sell to them with the whole time travel doubles thing , you know . Paradoxically speaking . Why don 't you tell us about these soldiers from Brad 's future ? I 'm sorry , your future . Sorry , come again ? In English , please ? Power suits , heavy weapons , warlord Kellogg future scenario ? Brad spelled it out for us . Maybe he 's the one you should be talking to . Your boyfriend . Perhaps you should start your investigation there . Let 's go , Kiera . Oh , yeah ! [ Laughs ] In your face , Kellogg . ... Shut it down . It 's an outside DNS attack , our entire network shut down . Well , get it back up . Everything alright , Matthew ? You know it 's not , you 're obviously behind it . We have nothing to do with whatever is going on right now . Is somebody mad at you , Kellogg ? Whoever just hacked into this company is breaking the law , Carlos . Why don 't you do your job ? You know what ? You 're right . I 'm sorry . I 'll get to the bottom of this . In fact , I know the perfect guy that can help us track down the perpetrators of this heinous act . And he 's a whiz with computers . What just happened ? I have no idea . Kellogg is up to something and I have a feeling those soldiers are just the tip of the ice berg . Yeah , no doubt about that . Look , if Brad is embedded with these guys and I 'm not judging , I 'm just saying , if you have questions maybe you should press him for answers . [ Phone ringing ] It 's gotta be Kellogg . Put him on speaker . [ Phone ringing ] Alec Sadler . Is Julian there ? He is , and you 're on speaker phone . You 're fired , Julian . You can 't fire me , I already quit . However you like . Alec , I know you 're behind this hack . Fix it . Right now . Or I take this to Defcon 1 . You already did that when you stole my company . Ok . Are you ready to play big league hard ball with me , kid ? Bring it . And CMR is connected . Just like old times . You miss the barn ? Every day . Alec , before we get to work , I need to know what you did to Kellogg . Nothing too harsh . Alec , what did you do ? I sort of locked him out of his own system and then downloaded and erased all the data and control software for Piron 's equipment . You 're asking for trouble . Actually , I 'm trying to send you home . What do you mean ? All of Piron 's anti-matter time travel research is in the data that I stole . I thought we could use the time to figure out a way to exploit the company 's tech and eventually send you home . Thank you . That 's inspired . Kellogg 's going to be so focused getting his business back up and running he won 't even have time to realize what we 're really up to . Good . While you 're working on that , I 'd also like you to help me find Brad and the soldiers . I thought you were staying out of it . It 's just for my own peace of mind . If he 's in tight with them , I 'll back off . But if he 's in trouble ... I understand . Can you do it ? Maybe . Their gear is probably operating on some advanced tech . Odd wavelength stuff . I could do a sweep of the spectrum , see if there 's any areas with unique energy signatures . It won 't give you an exact address , but I can narrow it down to a few city blocks . You could go down there using your super suit as a kind of antenna . I could give you a specific building . Alright , good enough . Let 's get started . You 're breaking down the power suits , cannibalizing the core components . Something like that . What exactly are you building ? This mission is a need-to-know basis , and you don 't need to know . Nolan ? Give it time . Marcellus has a lot on his plate and you - What about me ? You can 't see what we can . Alright , take a left . Try the end of the block . How long is this gonna take ? Depends on how fast you go . I take it back . I don 't miss this . Your CMR says you 're lying . Great . Shit . Are you following me ? No . It 's a total coincidence . What are you doing , Kiera ? Boyfriend issues ? Something like that . Kellogg 's soldiers are a problem for all of us . You don 't get to call the shots . Give me a head start . I 'll clear Brad from the area , you can roll in , back me up and do your thing . Woah , the signal just spiked . You 're getting close . Alec says we 're close . Are you gonna help me out or am I gonna shut this whole thing down right now ? Got it . It 's the building to your left , Kiera . This is it . Hey , head start , remember ? I changed my mind . Listen to me : I have seen these men in action . You need to have the upper hand , and right now you don 't . I can play nice . You got ten minutes . Perfect . Are you seriously gonna let Garza try anything ? No . Get Carlos on speed dial . I want him ready to roll , no matter what . Gotcha . Why take the chance ? It 's not that simple . We served together . You don 't win wars with sentimentality , Marcellus . No , you don 't . You win them with recon and support . Tonkin arranged this place , our supplies , and our comm . He 's delivered . It 's my call . We 'll see how it plays out . That is definitely not from now . I 'm recording all this , Kiera . You ever see anything like that in your time ? No , that 's a new one . It 's like time travel team six . We have 11 days max before the core degrades . If we 're gonna have a fight we 're gonna need more medical supplies . Crew is on edge . It 's their problem , not yours ? Marcellus , I don 't know half of these guys . You know we can 't do this without you . Looks like he 's convinced them he 's one of them . It 'll be nice having someone on the inside feeding us info . Woah , woah , what is that ? It 's cool . Can you grab me that , it looks like a pen ? Watch her , Kiera . What 's she doing ? Get her out of there . Get her out of there . Kiera , Brad is safe . You need to leave . [ gun shot ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gun shot ] [ gunfire ] Got her ! [ Gun shot ] Nice shot . Bite me . Watch our backs , there could be more of them . Alec , get me out of here . Now ! Alec , Alec , I 'm burned . I need a way out , now ! Ok , hang on , hang on , just give me a second ! [ Gun shot ] Now you 're out . [ Gasps ] I know who you are . That makes two of us . What are you doing here ? I can ask you the same thing . You 're not in a position to be asking any questions . I 'm a police officer , and that man is a suspect in an investigation that I 'm conducting . Now , I don 't know what you think you 're doing here but I do know that you 're involved with Matthew Kellogg , and so do the police . I 'm calling Carlos . Don 't ! What do you mean , " don 't " ? Don 't trust him . He might consider Kellogg an ally but he 's only interested in one thing . Kellogg . This is a waste of our time . Toss her . Marcellus , she could be useful . Useful ? What 'd he tell you ? Nothing . He tried to kill me , and he failed . Apparently not . [ crash ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] Let 's go after them ! Stand down ! We pack up and we move . Agreed . This place will be crawling with cops in no time . That was close . Too close ! Have you seen Emily ? Not for a while . [ Fighting grunts ] [ Fighting grunts ] [ Fighting grunts ] [ Fighting grunts ] Get out ! Now ! Alright , keep me posted . Yeah . Alright . So SWAT cleared the building , there 's no sign of our new friends . Surprise , surprise . [ Sighs ] What is it ? I just feel like we 've been down this road before . It 's Liber8 all over again . Well , this time we know they 're working for Kellogg and we 've got a man on the inside . If that 's the case , why don 't we have anybody in custody yet ? Maybe Brad will reach out . We can 't count on " maybe " . You know , ever since you got knocked out there 's been , I don 't know , something different . Sorry . I 've been preoccupied . Thoughts of 2077 . Home . Sam . Of course . I need to believe that path still exists for me . That I 'll be able to see him again . Well , I support you going home . I 'm not happy about it , but I support you . To going home . To going home . [ traffic sounds ] You 're late . I had to be careful . You said this was about Kellogg and his new friends . That 's the only reason I 'm here . So make it quick . I don 't think any of us can afford to let Kellogg become more powerful . More insulated , build and control an army that shapes history his way . What are you saying ? I 'm saying what 's good for you and Liber8 is most likely what 's bad for Kellogg . You want us to take out Kellogg ? To do your dirty work ? No . No , I think you 've got plenty of good reasons to kill Kellogg . I just don 't think you can afford to waste any more time . Goodnight , Jasmine . This package was delivered for you . I 've cleared it with security . Thank you , Jacqueline . Hiya , pal .

Most guys just violated restraining orders or some shit . - Yeah , that 's what I thought . - So , what are you in for ? Uh ... trafficking ... prescription drugs . - Allegedly . - Really ? You were moving a few pills to your buddies in the bar ? More like 100,000 worth . Oh yeah , Vikes , Big Boys , Red Birds ... French Fries , L.A. Turnarounds ... The real deal , baby - Are you done yet ? - Yeah . This is your guy . Making friends already , Donnie ? Ex ... excuse me , how do you know my name ? I know all about you . I 've got my eye on you . - A swan ! - Stop saying it like that . It was a vision of a swan . You fell down the stairs and bumped your head . Yes , but the swan wasn 't in my eye like a ... - glitch . - Well , everything appears to be normal . Anyway , we 're on our own , Rachel . Susan 's given up on Leda . But age has dulled up her ambition . You and I are still young . Don 't you want to live ? I do now , yes . Then we can 't just accept this . We may have been raised without familiar bonds , but ... you , Ira , are my brother . And I 'm beginning to believe that means something . You just stood without your crutches . And your aphasia completely cleared . Apparently , passion helps . No coffee , but I made chai . You still feeling it ? Yeah . I haven 't had a two day hangover in a long time . How are you ? I almost did something desperate . But if Delphine 's alive , I mean , I don 't know ... If she is alive , we 'll find her . I 'm proud of you , sestra . We both made it back from the dark side . Yeah . It 's time to see Mika . - Hello , Mika ! - Hello Kira . Hi Sarah . Hey , lose the mask . - Wanna give us a second ? Ok . - Yeah . Next time you want to talk to me , don 't come at me through my kid . She 's lovely . I 'm sorry we left on bad terms . Yeah , I thought you pissed off to enjoy your cool three mill . Three point seven . It 's well invested . Hi , I 'm Cosima . Oh ! Sorry . Don 't worry about it . If you want to keep it on , I think it 's funny . Beth told me about you . How 's your illness ? Um , you know , incurable - so , that sucks . - Uh , Kendall 's gone , so there are no original stem cells for research and our Creator 's gone dark in some Neolution coup . And the new bitch , Evie Cho had Alison 's husband arrested . - So what do you want , M.K. ? - There 's something you should see . I , uh , traced a dedicated satellite feed to an island in the North , disconnected from the grid . Evie Cho has forced Susan Duncan out of Project Leda . Leda will be dismantled for its assets . The monitor program , terminated . - And my subjects ? - Now your clones are being cut loose . No need for Helsinki events , their days are numbered anyway . However , Sarah and her ... self-aware sisters are still a threat . They won 't get such humane treatment . Oh my God . You and Beth were right ; we can 't do this alone . Right , so what are we gonna do ? Hey , M.K. is there any way that I could talk to Susan ? If there 's anyone who can help me , it 's her . There 's always a way . Two pieces of ID . Sign the visitor information form , - third line from the bottom . - Ok ! Donnie needs a lawyer , Felix . Adele is a lawyer . She is currently under suspension for being inebriated in court , but that 's good for you because your bank accounts are frozen . - Well , what does she know ? - A lot . - She 's far superior to legal aid . - I mean , about clones . Excuse me , pardon me . Sorry ! Sorry ... I 'm sorry . I had to park at the far end of the lot . Y 'all don 't even have valet here . - It 's a prison . - I 'm kidding . I 'm Adele , you must be ... - Oh . - Yeah , forgot to mention that ... that ... Alison is Sarah 's twin sister . Oh ! Oh , thank God ! I thought mama was losing it for a minute . You look just like her , except for , you know , less anger and more hygiene ! Felix , this isn 't gonna work . She reeks of alcohol . Ma 'am , you 're about to miss your visitation window . Excuse me , I 'm in conference with my client . And she will not be denied of her right to see her husband . Let me just have a look at this . I don 't want anyone frisking you ; it 's not as fun as it sounds . Severe panvasculitis . Also , signs of meningoencephalitis and segmental enteritis . So , what do you suppose that means ? That we 'll find a Rhabdovirus . I think it means we 're studying the wrong species . We 're all aware of our disease now , Susan . - It 's all on the table . - Yes , Charlotte is aware we will be starting a variety of treatments . Treatments do not mean a cure . We 'd like to know what the long term plan is . I suggest you take up a hobby too . Ira , have you shown her your toy soldiers ? Yes , perhaps I should take up carpentry . I could build us all coffins . Shall I start with the smallest first ? Hey ! Did you manage to make contact with Susan ? M.K. says she can . She 's had Susan out on some island . Gonna make her help Cosima . Well , that 's the main thing ; keep pressing on for a cure . Yeah , well , there 's still Evie Cho and her cop . We don 't know what their next move is . You alright , Mum ? Yeah ! Yeah . I 'm fine . - You wanna talk about it ? - No , not now . A cup of tea ? Ta . Ok , I 'm patching you in now . - Look . - Sarah ? How are you doing that ? Evie is monitoring all my communications . - It 's encrypted . She won 't see it . - Hello , Sarah . It appears we 're all in the same boat now . - Child . - I doubt that . Hi , love . You should go back to your book . - Where are you going ? - I just , uh ... I have to ... go on an errand . I 've been trying to cure the disease ever since it first appeared . But without the Original , I 'm sorry , I can 't ! - That 's not good enough . - Mum . Mum ! I agree . What do you suggest ? You need to work with someone who knows what they 're doing . Someone who can actually help . Hey . Surprise . Cosima ! It 's good to see you again ! Uh , yeah ! I 'm a bit conflicted about it , considering who your roommate is . Yo , Rachel . Yo . - Mum ! - What are you doing ? - You knew that was important . - S left . What ? Where 'd she go ? I dunno , she ... - got her gun and she went out . - What ? S ... ? You saw a gun ? We 're reduced to lab notes , but I 've uploaded what we have left of - the viruses we were working on . - I have them . I see you 've been trying to engineer your own vectors . Wow , Rachel ! I thought you were more into corporate power than hard science . As you know , I have a long perspective on our ailment . Scotty , look who wants to be on the team . - Rachel ? - Hello , Scott . How are you ? She stabbed us in the back . I 'm not working with her . She even cheats at Agricola . Ok ! Sorry , Susan . If you wanna move forward , Rachel 's out . You know what , Ira , you can leave too , Alright , if that 's what makes you comfortable . You can 't afford to exclude us , Cosima . Bye-bye . A musical ? Yes , we have a rehearsal tonight . Donnie ! Donnie , sweetie , they make you wear one of those horrible things ? ! Honey , just be cool , ok ? You 're the lawyer ? - Hm ? - You 're ... you 're the lawyer ? Yeah , I 'm kind of a stopgap , but yeah . She 's Felix 's sister , Adele . - Felix has a sister ? - Just don 't think about it right now . But ... How much does she know ? I don 't need to know anything just yet , ok ? Nothing that might incriminate you . Alright , Donnie , I 'm gonna give you a little jailhouse 101 . - Oh , yeah , I could use that . - Ok . Uh , while you 're inside , you don 't ... Donnie ? While you 're inside , you do not talk to the police , ok ? You don 't talk to the people in the common areas and you don 't talk to your celly . The only people you should be talking to are Alison and me . - Ok ? - Got it , yeah ! In the meantime , we 're gonna be collecting affidavits from community members and friends . The bail hearing is basically about just proving you 're not a flight risk . See , we 're in good hands . Hey ! What 's so important ? I think Siobhan 's about to do something rash . Get in the car . Ok . So , how rash ? Like , you know : take out the cop who killed her mum . - What ? - She 's got her rifle , I think that 's what she 's up to . She 's gonna make everything worse . No matter how bent Duko is - she can 't go killing a cop . - I know , I shoulda seen it coming . It 's some Black Irish shit , you know : revenge first , consequences later . Ok , ok , I 'll talk to someone who I can trust on this . We 'll find him . 'Cause you got arrested on Friday , your bail hearing - is not gonna be until Monday . - Monday ? ! It is a classic dick move cops pull to sweat someone . That way , they can hold you for two days without charge . I don 't know why they have it in for us . Well , that 's what we 'll find out when we go to the bail hearing . Ok ? You guys have bail , right ? Adele , can I just talk to my wife for a second ? Yeah , yeah , sure . Thank you . Honey ... do you see that guy over there ? - Hm ? - Do you see that guy there ? Don 't look , don 't look . He 's a Neolutionist . They put him in here with me . - Oh , Donnie ... - Be cool , ok ? Stop telling me to be cool , I 'm not cool ! I know that , but you just ... Shh ! Just ... He said he 's here to keep an eye on me . Oh God , Donnie . Oh Lord . Sweet baby Jesus . I 'm not gonna make it two more days in here Alison . Donnie , I know who 's done this . It 's this detective . He showed up after you were arrested . Duko . He 's behind all of it . Are you serious ? No , no , that 's ok . Yeah , Yeah , thanks , Raj . Duko is fully AWOL . Turned off the GPS in his car . So how are we gonna find him ? Shite ! - Mrs. Hendricks ? - What do you want ? Let 's not make this about me . So . How 's Donnie ? Oh , thank God . - S , where the hell are you ? - Doesn 't matter . What matters is I think I know how Evie Cho 's going to try and get to us . Why is Neolution arresting my husband ? Donnie 's innocent . You know what , this has got nothing to do with you and Donnie . You 're just caught in the crossfire . The people I work for would be more than happy to let you and your family ... live your lives . But ... what did he want ? I think you know . We all know who the real ... fly in the ointment here is . I don 't know why they don 't just leave Sarah alone ; she 's not a threat to Neolution . Not my call . I just need to find her . Well , I don 't know where she is . I don 't ! Jail 's not a good place ... for a sensitive man like Donnie . I don 't know how long he can survive in there . God ... So , you just have a little think about it , Ok ? Where would you find Sarah ? The location . I 'm gonna get back in touch with you ... real soon . - Shit ! - Alison ! Are you , uh ... Are you alright ? Let me help with this . I don 't know what came over me , heh ! Oh , I do . See , I was there when he was arrested , remember ? Come on , Ali . - So , how 's Donnie doing ? - He 's fine ! He 's very comfortable in orange . You and Donnie are stalwart members of our congregation . Hm . But recently , I feel like you 've begun to take your faith for granted . Reverend , the , the , the ... the police and the ... arrest , a huge misunderstanding . Was it ? I 'm sure the children who witnessed it will be just fine , you know , with ... with ... with ... with proper therapy . All I know , Ali , is you got a secret laying heavy on your heart and I can help you . Hm ... It 's an impossible situation , no one can help . Just ... just try me . What if ... someone ... asked you to do something ... And if you did it , then , you would protect someone you love , but hurt someone else that you care about ? Is Donnie one of those people ? Donnie 's your husband , Ali . You made a vow to love and protect him right ... right here , in this very church . Yes . - But ... - You know , this might be one of the questions that ... that only the Lord can answer . So ... so what you do is you ... you open yourself up , and ... let Him guide you . Ok , so , um ... I 'm gonna leave you two alone . Hm ! Alison might be uptight , paranoid and occasionally delusional , but she 's not a rat , you guys . We didn 't say she was a rat , we said she was being squeezed , maybe . - What if she cracks ? - She trusts you . Just check in with her , see if she 'll confide something . - Wear that . - No , wear that . Piss off ! Both of you ! Go spy on your own bloody sister . Remember , I 've got Adele trying to help her , yeah ? Oh , bugger . Hello , Alison , everything alright ? Yes , yes ! Um ... where 's Sarah ? Um ... Why ? What 's happened ? Ah ... Felix , could you come by the church ? Today , it 's rehearsal and I , um ... - need you . - Sure , yeah , I can come right now . Ok , thank you . See , the vectors that we engineered seemed hopeful , but it took us months to come up with even those few . And you had success with the initial testing ? One of our big problems is we can 't get Cosima 's cell population - to grow past the lag phase . - And I 'm not even sure - we 're using the right viruses . - You 've used both ... retro and adenoviruses . - Have you tried naked DNA ? - Have you seen our lab ? We have major trouble controlling contamination . Still , it 's remarkable what you 've achieved with so little . I assume that you 've used Kira 's cells again ? Yeah , they were helpful in a few attempts , but ... the father 's contribution to her DNA takes 'em way too far from the Leda genome . Whereas with the Original stem cells , we could induce from any direction we want . Embryonic stem cells . What if we created a blastocyst ? The ball of cells would contain all the stem cells we need . We 'd need fertilizable Leda eggs ... And Castor sperm from Ira . Where are you going to get the eggs from ? Oh ... Sarah and I will be right by the phone . If it looks like Alison is playing ball with Duko , - we have to cut and run . - Ok . Hey , this is M.K. - Yeah ? - I found something . - What have you got ? - I went spear phishing on Duko . Your detective receives payments from a Brightborn shell to an account in the Caribbean . He hid it well , - but I found it . - That 's good , Art 'll love that . - What else ? - There 's worse . Much more damning . He 's dangerous , Sarah . I 'll email you what I found . We 'll take whatever we can get , M.K. Sarah ? Thank you . I didn 't know if you would let me back in . Me neither . Uh ... talk soon , yeah ? After the way she left last time , why is she coming back ? I don 't know . But what we don 't know about M.K. could fill a library . What is happening to me ? Five , six , seven , eight . Ok ! Ahem ! No , we ... no ! We can 't both enter from the same side . I thought that 's what you said we should do ... Yes , but then , I saw how stinky it was , and ... - Ok ! - I 'm sorry , I 'm just ... - Do you need a minute , hon ? - Yes , yes , I 'm ... gonna do my face . - Alison ! - Oh , schiesse , Felix ! - Come . - So , what is going on , darling , and what 's wrong ? You look terrified . No , no , but ... yes , but , but ... I just feel so out of the loop . What 's everybody doing ? I haven 't heard anything . Sarah ? Oh , I thought that maybe there was something wrong with Donnie . No , just jail ... And how are you ? How 's Alison doing ? Any more police ? What do you mean ? No . No ! Oh , ok , I just thought maybe they 'd be investigating , looking for evidence . Finding out who Donnie might know ... - I wouldn 't tell them . - Of course not , no . I know that you know to keep things close to the vest . - Yeah ? - Mm-hm . Sarah 's just ... thinking that maybe this detective Duko might be coming after you over Evie Cho . She 's probably forgotten all about us . Um , is everything okay ? Yeah ! I just have to do something . Look , I know that you 're under a lot of pressure , but you need to keep strong , ok ? - Of course . - Your sisters are there for you . Mm-hm . Sarah is there for you . - Hello , Alison ! - Oh ! I don 't know where Sarah is . I understand . These are decisions of the heart . Here 's someone who might be able to help you with that . Hello ? - Ali , Honey ? - Oh , Donnie ? Donnie , are you ok ? What 's wrong ? You remember that Neolution guy ? He 's in my cell ... - with a shank . - A what ? A shank , a shiv . It 's what we call a knife in here . It 's a sharpened toothbrush , ok ? Listen , he says if you don 't tell them what they wanna know , he 's gonna stick it ... in my brain ... through my eye ! Oh , Donnie ! Donnie ? It 's your choice , Alison . It 's up to you . Sarah will be at a comic book shop called The Rabbit Hole , tonight . Ok . Good . If that 's true , I 'm gonna call that psycho back . Donnie 's gonna be fine , he 's gonna be out of there on Monday . But if it 's not true ... you have to say a little prayer . Duko 's call 's not coming .

Every case we found with Brightborn connections , you were the investigator . You 're a corrupt and mercenary man , Detective . Subjects murdered , witnesses disappeared . They threatened my family . My little niece . And paid you well , to your Cayman account . We found that too . They said they 'd kill her . My niece , Meline , is like ten . She has no one . - That 's a pretty name . - I had to take that money . - I put it aside for her . - So she 'd be taken care of . Exactly . It 's about family . Oh , I get it . - No ... no ... No , no , no ... - This is for my ma . No , no , no ! Hey . Cosima 's downstairs . Sarah , this is big . We couldn 't get mice cells to create a useable culture , but I figured that if we match a fertile Leda egg ... That 's the part I don 't like : my egg . With Castor , yes . So totally out of line , but that 's the two parts of Kendall Malone 's biology , rejoined . So , fertilize my egg with Castor sperm . That 's your eureka moment ? - Yeah . - Don 't mess with me , Cos . I 'm not . I 'm really not . This is the breakthrough we 've been waiting for . Is it ? The only problem is we don 't have the resources to do it alone . Oh , shit , what are you doing ? - Cosima 's coming here . - I look forward to working with her . She 's a deft mind . Her proposal is quite elegant , really . Yes , I 'm sure you 're very excited about your contribution , Ira . Anything for science . Science isn 't everything . Certainly not Evie Cho 's science . There 's still time to stop her . I want to go back , Mother . I want to work with Sarah Manning and the others to restore you . As the head of Neolution . They need Evie ... removed as much as ... - Oh ... - Are you alright , Rachel ? Yes . Yes , I 'm fine . Are you sure you can work with Sarah ? I look forward to it . Sarah 's fine . Recovering from the procedure at home . Great . Tell her her eggs are airborne . - Oh , man . - Scott , I wish you could see this . I 've never been this far North . It 's amazing ! Have you thought about how insane you are ? Jumping on a chopper to a mad scientist 's private island ? Dude , we are mad scientists . Don 't be a hater . Now you 're really scaring me . Where 's your sense of adventure , Scott ? I just want you to find a cure . We will .

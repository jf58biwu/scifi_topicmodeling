 95 , 96 , 97 , - 98 , - No peaking , Dash . I wasn 't . There are three of us , Agatha , my twin brother Arthur , and me , Dash . The first nine years of our lives we spent in a vegetative state . - Drug babies . - Children ! But a group of scientists , saved us with an experimental therapy . It gave us back our minds , and for a little while , a childhood . It also gave us something else . - _ - A gift . Precognitive ability blind study . Tuesday October , 2 . Test subjects Dashiell , Arthur , Agatha . Okay children . Twurlaxman . Red . 27 . - Sanchez . - Yellow . 81 . Hineman . - Blue . - 66 . We could see things . Little things about to happen all around us . But one thing stood out . Unbelievable . Who 's got another deck ? Oh , no ! Please , don 't ! Down on your knees ! Let 's see that pretty smile , bitch ! - It 's happening again ! - Get them sedated ! Extreme rising . Got too much solution . Can you see ? Let 's see that pretty smile , bitch ! See what , dear ? Murder . The scientists realized we were seeing every murder within a hundred miles , days before they happened . And that was the last we saw of the outside world . The government took us away , code named us the precognitives , and hooked our brains up to machines . They called it the Precrime Program . - _ - It took hundred of killers off the streets and saved thousands of lives . But it cost us our own . We never had the chance to grow up . We formed no memories , except the visions that we saw . Until it ended . Precrime was abolished . We were sent off to an undisclosed location to hide us from the world . But I just couldn 't hide forever . So I decided to come back . _ I 've been here six months now , all alone . I still see things before they happen ... Morning , sir , you might wanna duck . What ? ... which does have its advantages . We live in an age of progress . But since Precrime ended ... But it doesn 't make it easy to fit in . Especially when technically you don 't exist . _ - Whoa ... whoa ... whoa ! - Stand clear . In case you 're wondering , my future is the one thing I can 't see . You look stressed , man . Try one of Harts ' new totally baked goods . But I 'm still haunted by everybody else 's . I keep this book to remember the details . But all I ever see , are flashes . Never quite enough for a complete picture . Since I 've been back , a hundred and three people have been murdered here . Men , women , children . I haven 't gotten to a single one in time . Until today . - Today , is going to be different . - _ These days it seems like everyone ... As mayor , my Hawkeye system will change all of that ... this is Precrime ending ... To your right is Bartlet Plaza , established in 2022 . Oh no , no no ! - Police ! Call rescue ! - Edward , did you hear that ? How about a little thinking music ? Uniforms canvassed the floor . Neighbors claim they didn 't hear a thing and don 't even ask me about the hallway cameras . Hm , let me guess . Out of service ? Yep . So I have no face recs , no eye-denti scans . To what do we owe the honor , V ? I thought this was Blake 's case . I needed some air . Oh , lucky you . This perp left the window open . What 's the Open Vistas Center ? Some sort of neuro rehab . Our victim was a nurse . We 're running it . Give me some room . _ Let 's play this through . The victim comes home . She chains the door . She goes to hang her coat , but she misses . She 's in a hurry . - Packing . - _ - But then someone kicks on the door . - _ Signs of struggle . - _ - She confronts him , pushes her down . _ _ She defends herself . _ _ She has a path to get away but she doesn 't take it . She goes for him instead . She lets it happen . Why ? Our victim was protecting someone . Can you believe we used to stop this stuff before it happened ? Unfortunately , Precrime was way before our time , girl . Now all we do is , mop up messes . Who was she protecting ? What ? You think our perp made himself a sandwich ? Not unless he 's still in kindergarten . Lindsay show me infrared . _ What is it ? We ran her eye-dent , the victim was her aunt . Babysitting . I 'm the first person you call the second you track down her parents . Sure thing , Detective . When they set us free , we promised not to intervene in their affairs ! I am being careful . Is that what you call racing to a crime scene like some kind of action hero ? You think I can 't see it , Dash ? I don 't wanna know what you see , Agatha . If you go to the police with this it will be a mistake . You should have seen her , Ag . This girl , she must be , as young as we were - when it started , when they ... - Is that what this is ? You think you can fix the past by meddling with the future ? Suppose you made it there in time , what then ? Would you confront the killer , fight him off , or tell the police who you are ? - What you are . - You know , how much I see out here . - If I could just get to one in time .. - You can 't . You know that . Your gift is incomplete without your brother . - There are people who will use you , Dash . - I won 't let them . You 're so haunted by other people 's futures , you forget the only future you cannot see is your own . - But I can , and I 'm warning you ... - Stop . Come home ! Where you belong . The detective that you go to - I 'm hanging up . - ... she will only use you like a tool ... The precogs were kept in an isolated chamber ... Who knows about the precogs ? It stands for " precognitives " . Their powers started when they were just children even younger than you are now . Their names and faces were kept secret from the public but the police would use what they saw . Their future visions to stop criminals before they did bad things . For their own protection , the three precognitives were sent to an undisclosed location . Welcome to Judiciary Plaza . Please be advised all public areas are subject to facial scan surveillance . If applying for adult jury , please proceed to level 3 . Hey , hold it ! Hands where I can see ' em . I have something for you . Slowly . 1313 . Where did you get this ? I have to go . - Who are you ? - I have to go ! You need to catch him . It 's only temporary . Sorry . What ? _ Shouldn 't you be out collecting Maglev tickets , Vega ? I heard this was your case , Blake . Figured that I 'd solve it for you so that you could take the credit , and land the big promotion like the last time . It 's called delegating . That 's what lieutenants do . I 'll take notes . You should , ' cause you 'll make a great lieutenant ... once I 'm your captain . But I don 't need you on this one , Vega . Because I have a lead . It turns out Open Vistas is no ordinary rehab . They specialize in Markus ' Syndrome . A brain disorder common to former Precrime prisoners . Halo burn . So you 're saying my victim was a nurse in a building full of killers ? I 'm saying , my victim . And future killers , technically . The city set them free after Precrime was abolished . Oh , that doesn 't make them innocent . - These people would be murderers . - Yeah , well , the trick is which one are we looking for ? We have no DNA , no face to run . What if we did ? Some weirdo gave me this in the plaza , and then ran off . Like an informant ? - We should run point con ... - And by " we " , you mean ... me . It 's my tip . On my case . _ We got a match . Sahm Adrangi . A drug addict . Hooked on clarity . Until Precrime nailed him for the future murder of a DEA agent . And look how he planned to do it . By throwing him out the window . Well , at least he has a brand . _ Eye-dent puts his last location at a steel farm in this borough . Vega , I wish you could join me . Stand clear . Stand clear . Sahm Adrangi ! Do not move . Drop your weapon ! Peekaboo , bitch . Vega ! Stand down . Let 's face it , Will . You 're not a closer . You ... you have no idea . - Stand clear . - What are you talking about ? - No ! - Don 't do it ! No ! I would have closed him differently , but ... Okay . Hey , nice job back there . But I thought the whole goal was to bring them back alive . Now she tells me . It was a suicide . He didn 't want to talk . My guess is , he had an accomplice . What about your tipster ? Did you get a look at him ? Only in disguise . Then he jabbed me with this . And then ran off . Temporary paralytic enzyme . Disguises your face by turning the muscles into mush . Turns out it works on your legs too . Oh . Well , whoever you guy is , he managed to dodge all the surveillance feeds . But I did pull this off a selfie drone . - Ooh , nice photo bomb . - Yeah , it gets better . I ran the DNA we found on the possessions ... - No criminal record ? - No record at all . This guy is a ghost . Yeah , with one creepy-ass imagination . Or maybe not . Check this out . There 's a dozens murder drawings in this book . I bet you each one is a real crime . Maybe he hacked the database . No one hacks my database . Okay , so that 's out . A watcher . Someone who grows up without any human interaction . Always on the outside looking in . All right , let 's scrub the crime scene feeds . Aye , aye . _ See anyone you recognize ? Nope . Nada . Whoever your guy is , he 's living off the grid . Sounds like a trip to this borough . Vega ? Ride along ? No , you go ahead Blake . I 've got tickets to collect . You 're letting him go alone ? I call that delegating . Okay , next karaoke night , you 're gonna have to tell me what happened between you two . The watcher . Search this face . Last location . Bingo ! Order up ! One cheeseburger and a hotdog for table 5 . Mmm , French fries . May I ? Um ... - No , stick around . I like company . - Uh , oh no , I was just about to , um ... Can you believe these used to be unhealthy ? Thank God for the genetic revolution . Do you always get the munchies after watching a woman die ? - What ? - That tip you gave me , this look like your friend ? The murderer . You got him ? That 's one way to put it . I wasn 't quite sure where to send the medal . For me ? Oh , oh , no thank you . Okay , let 's just skip past the part where you play dumb , and I threaten to bring you in . In ? No ! No , no , no . I 'm fine , right here . These drawings put you at the scene of at least a dozen murders . - You 're telling me that 's just bad luck ? - Oh no , no , you don 't understand . - I am just a ... yes ! - What ? A lookout ? No , I ... I mean , I only ... see them . Oh , so you like to watch . Like to watch ? No . I need air . I need to go . - I need to leave . - Sit down ! Just breathe , okay ? I get it . You 're not a killer , I can see that . - Y ... you can ? - You came to me . But why ? Are you in too deep ? Are you afraid of someone ? I can help you . - Not now ... not now ... not now . - Just tell me what 's going on . - Not now , what ? - Please ! You need to let me ... Can you see ? See what ? Murder . Someone call an ambulance ! Call an ambulance ! Someone call an ambulance . ... of this city ... the city of the future . An ambulance is on its way . No ! I need to go . Okay . Okay , okay , okay . You 're one of them . Please ... _ No wonder you 're not in the database ... you 're one of the twins . Dash . Our records were erased after Precrime ended , and then we were sent away . - The things you see ... - There are people who would use us . - But you came back , why ? - Are you going to bring me in ? Shouldn 't you be telling me ? That would make things easier . I can 't see my future , only others . But that fit back there ... You saw a murder , didn 't you ? I can 't be doing this . - Who 's the victim , give me a name ! - I don 't know , please ! Don 't lie to me , in Precrime - they got names . - We were a hive then , linked . It 's different now . Agatha , her gift is stronger , but Arthur and me ... we are like ... like one mind , split in two . He gets the names . I only see what happens . So where is he ? - Where is Arthur ? - I need to go . You have my drawings . There are murders in there the police haven 't solved yet . I 'm done mopping up the messes . I can 't help . I told you . I tried the last time , and ... I don 't see enough . Then let me help you . Don 't you wanna stop just one ? And you found me for a reason . I can 't keep getting close . Either can I. ... the city of the future . ... age of prophets . ... but since Precrime ended ... we 've gone backwards . - Crime rates have risen ... - What is it ? As mayor , my Hawkeye system will change all of that ... Peter Van Eyck for mayor . Peter Van Eyck was the Deputy Chief of Precrime . He has to have enemies . Someone 's after his wife . It could be for revenge . Wait , he worked in Precrime ? Relax . You three were in isolation , right ? No one ever saw your face . So ... What do we do ? How do we save her ? You let me do the talking , and any signal you pick up , you let me know . Can 't we just warn them ? Sure . Yeah . I 'll tell them that you 're a precog , and that you saw it in a vision . That 's a great idea . - No ! - Look , this is an investigation now . You gave us a victim , now we need to find out who plans to kill her . Sorry to have you wait , we 're running on 2 minute offense . Peter Van Eyck . My wife , Olivia . And this is Jack . It 's a long day on the trail for the little guy . - Ah ! - Oh ! Uh ? Uh , he ... has a cold . Oh , we appreciate the warning . Keep your distance , honey . We need you - healthy for tomorrow 's rally . - Mm . - Tomorrow ... on the mall ? - She shouldn 't go to that . I am starting to like these people , Peter . But I 'm calling it a day for Jack . Your staff can blame me . - Can you say " bye-bye " ? - Bye . Bye . So ... what can I do for you , Detectives ? Detectives ? Like I told your aid , ah , we 're following a lead about tomorrow 's rally . Have you had any recent threats ? Not that I 'm aware of . But I wouldn 't be surprised . I was in law enforcement for almost ... 10 years . Yeah , uh , Precrime is what made me want to become a cop to begin with . Just my luck it disbanded before I finished the academy . That was a good program despite its flaws . Now it 's time to move on . - My new system ... - Oh , Hawkeye ! Yes , you ... can 't miss the ads . Ambient surveillance , algorithmic sweeps , predictive policing relying on hard data , not the ... psychic instinct of some genetic freaks . - Freaks ? - So , uh , about those threats ... Well , my security team monitors all cyber traffic relating to the campaign . Ashby 'll get you sorted . - Right this way . - Thank you , Detectives . - You lose by a landslide . Hmm ? - I 'm sorry ? Nothing . Can you really see that far ahead ? No . _ We run a constant passive search on social media , city surveillance , even purchase patterns . These incidents have all been checked - and disregarded . - Stop ! Open Vistas . It 's him ! Adrangi . You know this man ? We met ... briefly . The system flagged his username for running a web search on security parameters at tomorrow 's rally , but ... dismissed the threat . Help yourselves . Dismissed ? Why ? He 's a murderer . Because Adrangi killed himself three hours before that search was run . Open Vistas treatment center . Every person here was once a convicted Precrime killer . One of them obviously didn 't learn his lessons . I remember them . James Landon . Alison Chen . Daniel Carmi . Hey ! Earth to Dash . I did this to them . No , you stopped them from committing murders . It 's not your fault the containment system fried their minds . Can I help you ? Maybe . Did you know the man in this bed , Mister Adrangi ? Only for a few weeks , since they moved my father to this ward . Why ? He threw a woman out a window then committed suicide . Okay . - During this part , I work alone . - That 's ... awful ! It might not have been all he was planning , and he may have had help . - Is this his ? - I think so . _ And your father had access to it ? Well , I ... suppose . This the device than ran the search on Van Eyck . - Van Eyck ? - Former Deputy Chief of Precrime . He put your father away , didn 't he ? For something that he never did . Or maybe didn 't have the chance to . The precogs saw him murder his wife . My mother . But he loved her more than anything . The police took him anyway . Put him in a halo . By the time Precrime ended , and they let him out , she 'd died of grief . And he ... His brain was so scarred by the containment that he forgot her name . Is that why you drink ? Excuse me ? He means ... that must be hard on you . Can we see him ? This way . " Is that why you drink ? " - You said tell you when I saw something . - Are you familiar with the concept of a whisper ? Ask what you want about Adrangi , but don 't expect much . These days my father only cares about his hobby . You have visitors , Dad . Get down from there . Go easy , will you . Always . So what do you see ? Is this the guy from your ... you know ? I didn 't see his face . These people are here to talk to you . - About Olivia Van Eyck . - Van Eyck ? You shouldn 't stand there . Not familiar with that bird . You shouldn 't stand there . Van Dam 's vanga on the other hand . Native to Madagascar . She 's not a bird . She 's a politician 's wife . But you knew that . I really wouldn 't stand ... Really ? You told me to whisper . Haven 't you seen enough ? Actually , I 'm just getting started . We found Adrangi 's pad besides your bed . If someone was researching Van Eyck 's security arrangements , you wouldn 't happen to know anything about that , would you ? Research ? No . My work is here . My life 's work . - Pigeons ? - Passenger pigeons . The species went extinct a hundred and fifty years ago . Until my father brought them back . He used to be a brilliant man . I still have my moments , darling . On the clear days . How does he do that ? Brain computer interface . Wireless signal to an implant embedded in the skull . Stay away from that one . What 's wrong with it ? Him ! Avian plasmosis . Highly lethal . Some poor things should remain extinct . But they 're all you have left . Because Precrime took your life away , and you blame Van Eyck for that , - don 't you ? - What ? Is that why you planned to kill him at tomorrow 's rally ? - What ? No ! - That 's crazy ... - you can 't believe ... - You know what I think ? You and Adrangi planned this together . But then some poor nurse found out , so he threw her out of a window . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Of course you don 't . - I 'm innocent ! - He 's gonna jump . - I 've always been innocent . - Dash , not right now . You need to arrest him . - Arrest ? ! - What ? No ! - Hey ! - Dad ! Stop ! What ? I 'm sorry . Did I mess up ? What makes you say that ? The Simpsons season 75 spectacular ! - Streaming only on FOX . - No hits yet , but , I 'll let you know when Rutledge pops up in the grid . Where 'd you get this lead anyway ? There 's nothing in the system . New CI I 'm working with . Good instincts . Just needs a little work on people 's skills . And keep this between us , will you ? You mean away from Blake ? One of these days , you 're gonna have to tell me everything . If you want details you should ask Blake . He 's really good at telling stories about himself . Oh , it looks like we 're interrupting something . I gotta go . Is this your boyfriend ? No , this is Dash . My colleague . - He 's ... consulting on a case . - For the police . This once . Sure . Colleague . When I was your age , we had this thing called Tinder . - Mom ! - What ? It 's how I met your father . You can 't spend your whole life at the precinct , Lara . Anyway , he 's cute . Staying for dinner ? - Yes . We 're ordering Chinese . - We are ? No , we 're not . I 'm cooking . We 're gonna sit down to a nice meal . Who wants Chinese ? ♪ Holly came from Miami , F.L.A. ♪ I see you 've found my mom 's man cave . She loves the old stuff . Produced by David Bowie , Mick Ronson on piano . Lou Reed had a cold that day . We had a lot of down time on the island . Maybe you 're the one who should be living with my mother . Sarcasm . Never mind . Um ... Make yourself at home . It must be nice . To have a family . It 'd be ... nicer with some more space , but yeah . It has its moments . Your son seems like a good kid . Rico ? No ! No , not my son , my little brother . Mom hit sixty and went off birth control . She thought she had an empty nest to fill , and then I moved back in . So ... Cop salary . You became a cop because of Precrime . I ... became a cop because I ... lost my father when I was six . Drive-by shooting . He was protecting me . So yeah , Precrime is an appealing concept , don 't you think ? We never really had a choice . They found you when you were kids , right ? Some ... doctors somewhere ? They always told the public that you three volunteered . Maybe not . When we were nine , they started testing us . When we were fourteen , they hooked us up and put us in the milk bath . That 's pretty much the last thing I remember for the next ten years . Except for , what we saw . I guess that would explain my people 's skills . You heard ? Sorry , I didn 't ... I didn 't ... That 's okay . Arthur used to tease me too . I 've been told I have an awkward side . Well , people aren 't all that complicated . You ... make them think you 're just like them and they open up . So what happened to him , anyway ? Arthur ? One day we came home and he was gone . Agatha says someone took him . She saw it coming . But then , a month ago , I felt him . His presence . He 's still alive . And he needs my help . Well , he 's not the only one right now . That rally is in twelve hours , and , we 've hit a wall . At least in Precrime they could get inside your head . You know , see what you see . Maybe we still can . Wally was our caretaker in Precrime . The only real life face we ever saw . Afterward , he helped transition us into the new home . Down , Kanye ! Were you followed ? Quick , get in , get in . Streets have eyes . My God . It 's really you . Oh ! Ah ... So grown up . So human . How long have you been back ? Why didn 't you call sooner ? Been laying low . Tell me everything . Your brother ? Agatha ? Hey , can you guys catch up later ? Oh , typical cop ! Hurry ! Hurry ! I know my rights by the way , in case that contact lens is still recording . I 'm a homicide cop . Using an illegal psychic to stop a murder , I 'd say we 're all off road already . This is Vega . She 's a ... colleague . Can you help us ? They say you were the weak one . Agatha would get the bigger picture , Arthur got the names , you just saw bits and pieces , the little things the others missed . Missed ? They covered it all up after the program failed . Wanted so badly for their precogs to be perfect . They never could accept one little inconvenient truth . What truth ? For Precrime to work , the public needed to believe that the murders we saw were destiny . That people couldn 't change their futures . The dirty secret was that even the three precogs didn 't always see the future in the same way . Outlier visions . They were filed in minority reports . Yeah , which means the future isn 't set in stone . Ah ! Little homemade neural interface . Kind of what we used back in the temple , just , ah ... not as perfected . As in , er ... a little pain ? Maybe a lot . Okay . Here comes a pinch . - What 's happening ? - Oh , no . Oh , no , no , no , no , no . He is weaker than I thought . It 's hurting him . You need to stop . Don 't ... stop . Argh ! He 's all right , he 's all right . Look . What is it ? The murder weapon . Hey . You did good . The diseased pigeon , that 's how Rutledge is planning to assassinate Van Eyck . But it 's his wife who dies instead . Collateral damage . Call Akeela Scott . Any hits on Mason Rutledge ? Well , it 's a Hail Mary . I 'll take it . There 's record of the Rutledge family once owning property in Virginia . An old tobacco farm . Shut down when the amendment passed . You shouldn 't stand there . Thanks , but right now , I 'm not worried about a little bird crap . You have the right to remain silent . You have the right to an attorney . If you can 't afford an attorney , - one will be appointed to you . - No . Do you understand these rights ? It still happens . - What ? - I still see it . That can 't be . Get up ! Hey , get up ! Who else are you working with ? Come on . Someone at Open Vistas with access to your birds . - Come on , give me a name ! - Or what ? You 'll arrest me ? I spent eight years in a waking nightmare . Do you have any idea what that 's like ? I do . Sometimes , I wake up thinking I 'm still there . Like , everyone in the whole word has a future , except me . They took everything from us . My wife . Her mother . Her . The daughter . She 's doing it for him . - She and Adrangi planned this together . - No . And now , former most valuable player of Superbowl ' 87 for the Washington Red Clouds , and future mayor of this great city , Peter Van Eyck ! _ Come on ! You got my vote . We 're with you Van Eyck ! Hey , Van Eyck ! Hey ! A woman is gonna die right now if we don 't stop it ! Where is Rutledge 's daughter ? I told you , without the others I don 't see enough . You need to try . Think . Think .

A threat that would have never have got this far had the Hawkeye system been in place . - Mr. Van Eyck ... - Do we know anything more about the nature of the threat ? - Well , I 'll leave the details to Deputy ... - Thanks for closing my case without killing anybody .

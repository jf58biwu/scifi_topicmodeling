 Priviously on Helix ... - Do you know the way to San Jose ? - I don 't understand . - You 're not gonna die on me , are you ? - I 'm already dying . - TXM-7 . I thought you were- - - Immortal , not indestructible . I guess the sword works . There 's no going back now . What has the world outside ever given to you ? Nothing . I wanted to be a healer . You look nervous , Olivia . Why did you kill my mom ? Now I 'm all alone . I 'll be your family now . Why don 't you come with me ? I can 't . I have to finish what I started . I still gotta turn you in . First Bank of Atlanta . Safety deposit box 274 . The Mother Tree . Michael must have had some way to access its roots . That thing is not a child . - Shut up . - Keeping it like that is cruel . You are my son . My family . They became pure vessels . Release them . All of them . It 's Mothers ... she 's everywhere . We can create widespread infertility without any mycotic effects . - You have to let me go . - I can 't . - You shot me ! - Well , you were gonna shoot me . Stay with me , Alan , okay ? Stay with me , Alan . Alright ? You have a son now . You think about that . You 're gonna pull through this . Think about that . No sign of that lunatic Peter . Thinking he 's crazy is your first mistake . What do you call firing at a US Navy helicopter ? Aggressive . They 're gonna think twice about a second evac . We gotta keep trying . There 's no telling how far the mycosis has spread . Mayday , mayday , this is Dr. Kyle Sommer with the CDC . We have the cure for mycosis . I repeat : we have the cure . Kyle , we need to be smart about this . We have to find another way off this island . The longer we wait , the higher the rate of infection . If one of those ships gets to the mainland ... We need as much of the cure as you can carry . Can you handle that ? Absolutely . Where you going ? To make a deal with the devil . What have you done ? Save ... Amy . For what ? To look like this ? Look at the two of us . What a pair we make . We 're absolutely hideous . Beautiful . I 'm not beautiful anymore . You know what I am , Landry ? Free . Free to do whatever I want to whoever I want . And right now ... I 'd like to thank my immortal sisters for my new face . Two parts cannabis indica . One part capsaicin . When it came to pain management , my mother was a genius . Someone has desecrated the council hall . - One of the others saw Jerome- - - Thank you , Carson . I thought it was a fool 's errand , but an outsider found what 's been beneath our feet for centuries . - The Mother Tree ? - What remains of her , anyway . Eli ... her roots may still be viable . How does that help us ? Dr. Walker said Ilaria wants Mother . - Why shouldn 't you be the one to deliver it ? - Yes ... We can bypass the Navy and CDC . - I 'm sure they 'll pay handsomely . - It 's not just about money . Ilaria has power and influence . Anne , you and I are gonna be heard around the world . Those 200 followers ... Imagine two million . I would follow you anywhere . I need to get underneath the tree and access the roots . There are blocked stairways behind the council hall . We were always told they were dead ends . Another one of Michael 's lies . For us , I 'll always find a way . Hey , buddy , why don 't you rest for a bit ? If I gave this much blood , you 'd have to scrape me off the floor . I 'm fine . When we get back , first thing I wanna do is order a pizza from Fellini 's . Thin crust , sausage and mushroom . Two pizzas , one for each of us . Then ... glorious sleep for a week straight . - That 's a long time . - We 'll take breaks , of course . - Gotta make time for PlayStation . - What 's that ? You mean you 've never played Call of Duty 4 ? Aw man , you are in for a treat . I know we were real close to getting out of here . I 'm disappointed too . - But nothing 's gonna stop us from going home . - Us , maybe . - But not my mom . - I know , Soren . I wish things were different . It 's not fair . Peter killed my mom . Someone should kill him too . Whoa , hold on , now . It may not be perfect or fair , but there 's a system in place to punish people like Peter . And I promise you I 'll do whatever I have to . Peter is never gonna hurt you or anybody else again . Now what ? Let me find a flashlight . Soren ? Come back here ! Soren ! - How long have I been here ? - Five days . It 's strange how the tables have turned . - How 's that ? - I was here 30 years ago . But I wasn 't the one in this bed . It was Alan . What happened ? I shot him . That doesn 't make any sense . Love rarely does . I haven 't completely been honest . Thirty years ago , I was here too . You 've killed my mom ! Soren , you really shouldn 't have done that ! What you mean you are here thirty years ago ? Who are you ? At least tell me why you stole my father 's sword . You know what it means , don 't you ? I can read it . It 's a string of letters . Dozens of them . CACGUCACL ... C-a-c-g-u-c-a-c-l ... That 's an RNA code . Each letter stands for a nucleotide . - It 's a recipe for a virus . - Like TXM-7 . But he said it was his legacy . Why would my father create a virus to kill immortals when all he ever wanted to do is spread immortality ? Maybe someone changed his mind . Goddammit , Caleb , I 'm dying ! I don 't have time for games , just tell me ! I wanna tell you everything . First you have to answer one question . Do you know the way to San Jose ? What .. ? Carson ? Hello , mother . What ? Is something the matter ? Amy , your face ... you 're hurt . Since when do you care how I feel ? Of course I care . You 're my daughter . Oh , really ? You didn 't seem to care that much when I begged you not to let my father have me . I couldn 't admit I was wrong about Michael , because that would mean my entire life was a lie . I told myself laying with him was a privilege . But it was no honor . It was abuse . So deeply rooted that I accepted it like the air we breathe . - I am so sorry , Amy . - No ! No , no , no , no ! You don 't get to do this ! Not now . It 's too late . Look at me . Look at me ! Look at me ! There 's still hope for us . Oh no , mother . There 's no hope . And no amount of distance will allow us to escape what we are . You may not look like us , but inside ... you 're a monster . A freak . Just like me . Please , give me another chance . You don 't deserve another chance . And I won 't allow you one . The baby . No . Give me the baby . - No . - I won 't let you make him like me ! No ! If you follow us , I 'll make sure he never cries again . Goodbye , mother . Constructive symbiosis . The union of two species in a single body . That 's Mother . The root is the host , but the fungus causes the infertility . Luckily , she 's also disjunctive . She doesn 't need the root for survival . She can survive in any genetic environment . You should really stop talking . I barely had enough thread to suture the wound . - Jules - - I said no talking . You can 't give Mother to Ilaria . We can control it . Like Michael ? Mycosis spreading through bees ... Even Ilaria can 't control nature . - Can 't you see that I don 't have a choice ? - You do . - You do , you have a choice . - You know what I have ? I have less than 12 hours to stop the release of NARVIK . What happened now ? She ... shot me . And he 's still talking . I don 't wanna get in the middle of this . Can I have a minute ? Look , I know you need to get back to Paris as soon as you can and I wanna know if that job offer still stands . Yeah . Yeah , of course it does . I need to get my son off this island , along with the rest of my team . OK , done . Look , joining us at Ilaria 's in the best interest for you and the baby , okay ? Where did Alan go ? I don 't know , but he has Mother . This will do nicely . Give it to me . He 's ... my ... - friend . - Friend ? You ... you think it likes you ? Let me show you how much . Cry really loud so all the sisters can hear you . Good baby . You have no friends . Julia . Alan is here . We 're running out of time . If we don 't find- - We will . What if we don 't ? He has Mother , he has my sat phone ... I should 've just let him bleed out . Maybe you should 've . I know it sounds callous , but he put himself in this position . - Let 's just focus on finding him . - And then what ? Are you prepared to kill him ? Because he 's not gonna stop . His hatred for immortals- - he 's obsessed . It can 't help you and I being what we are . It 's not our fault . You know , for the past year I 've been jumping into every hot zone I can find . You 've probably done a lot of good . I wish it was that . The truth is , if I stopped to think about what all this means , I 'd lose my mind . - Did you hear that ? - Yeah . Oh , my God . Who would leave a baby like this ? I don 't know . Let 's just take it and go . Sarah , they want the baby . No , no , no ! Be careful with that ! No , don 't ! Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Alan could be bleeding to death . We don 't have time for this . Trust me . Please , please ... Please , he 's my son . Amy ripped my baby out of me . And I 'm guessing that she was responsible for what happened to you . But please don 't hurt him because of what she did . Thank you . Soren ? Where have you been ? I 've been looking all over for you . - Are you all right ? - I 'm fine . What were you thinking ? - You had me worried sick . - I 'm sorry . I was just following my path . From now on , I need to know where your path goes at all times . Look , this is kind of new for both of us , - so we gotta figure it out together . - It 's just ... no one ever cared where I went before . All right , let 's get back to work . OK . Drop the can . Do you even know how to operate that thing ? I don 't need to . Is that all you got ? Two weeks ago , I would have had a completely different answer to that question . You know , I should be thanking you . When you left me down there in that hole , I thought it was the end . But it was just the beginning . See , that 's the thing about ... hitting rock bottom . It gives you a lot of time to reassess what 's really important . Not so fast . You know , I used to think that I ... I didn 't deserve to be happy . That I 'd never ... really find love , get married , have children . But I 've learned that family is not what you 're born with , it 's what you choose . Family ... stands by you no matter what . Unconditionally . That is why ... I know , Alan ... that you are not my family . You really mean it ? Sure I do . You 've ever made a cure guest name . But didn 't Alan make it ? I 'm sure he wouldn 't mind if we named it after you . How about , uh ... Sorenol ? How about ... Olivia ? I think that 's a great idea . Smell that ? Yeah . Smells like smoke . Nature Green , this is the USS Independence . We have a visual . Fire on ground . Do you copy ? Heck yeah , we copy . Standing by with the cure . Be advised . We 're sending in another chopper . Evac at 0400 , over . We gotta go find Dr. Jordan . I 'm not letting you out of my sight . Come on . We need to get out of here . Not until I get my bag back , and Mother . How are you gonna do that ? You have no idea where Alan is . I do now . Who do you think started that fire ? He 's trying to destroy Mother . Come on . - No , Julia , I can 't . - What ? I have to get my child to safety . Ok , I 'll meet you outside . Dr. Walker ? Dr. Jordan ... I can 't wait to see what the ladies have done to you . What are you doing ? Let go ! Let go ! Let go of me ! No ! Landry ! Landry ! Landry ... Help me ! Landry ! Landry ! Help ! Help ! No ! Landry ! Landry ! No ! No ! No ! Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! Jules ! Alan ! Alan ? Where 's my bag ? Where 's Mother ? Peter ... Ok , come on . Come on . Come on . Let 's go . - I 'm going back for our baby . - No , Eli . It 's too late . I 'm his father . I have to try . Please , don 't do this . I can 't lose both of you . I told you . I 'll find a way . Sarah ! Sarah ! You oughta keep that kid on a tighter leash . That little shit stabbed me . Someone needs to teach him some manners . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Is that true ? Did you stab him ? Don 't ever do that again . Don 't ever do that either . About time someone did that . Let 's go . Landry , stop . Where are you going ? Home . Come on , Julia , where are you ? Before I show you something ... do you know the way to San Jose ? Yes , I do . We were running late on our way up north , to where Alan 's family was . We blew a tire on the 101 . The car swerved across four lanes of traffic . We got a tow to a repair shop in San Jose . City hall was just down the street , and in the time it took to patch the tire , we got married . And I 'll never forget what he said . Your love is gonna kill me . I do know the way to San Jose . Who are you ? Soren ? I haven 't heard that name for a long time . Dr. Sommer , you have something for us ? 17 vials of mycosis cure . We 're not gonna have time to run this through the normal drug testing protocol . You don 't have to . This is the real deal . - Can you stake your life on it ? - I already have . If what he 's saying is the truth , we are gonna save thousands of lives with this cure . It 's called Olivia . Okay . We 'll take good care of Olivia . Peter , you opportunistic prick . I know you have Mother . Where is she ? Why , right here , Julia . Claire ? What are you doing here ? When we got word of a rescue from St. Germain , we came as quickly as we could . But I didn 't call you . That doesn 't mean we weren 't listening . Dr. Farragut has shared how instrumental you were in securing the Mother fungus . How very thoughtful of him . We 'll have to make sure he 's properly compensated . No need . Madame Wallenberg has been ... more than generous . What about NARVIK-C ? Narvik-C ? Please , tell me you haven 't discovered a new strain . But you and the board told me about it . I ... don 't seem to recall that . Nor do I think would anyone at Ilaria . Wow , Dr. Kyle ... I 've never seen so many lights . Dr. Sommer . You 've brought in Dr. Farragut ? Yes , ma 'am . I have your man . Do we have enough to make an arrest ? First Bank of Atlanta . Safety deposit box number 274 . It was Alan , wasn 't it ? Why else would my wedding story be the answer to your question ? It was Alan and your father . - They created TXM-7 . - They were always at odds . They found common ground . After Ilaria used the fungus to gain control of human procreation , they engineered a virus to kill immortals . But they also came up with a cure . You ? You 're the cure ? Alan said my blood was special . That 's why he hid me on this island . - And I 'm gonna stay here until- - - Until TXM-7 wipes out the entire immortal population . Take it . Maybe I don 't deserve it . You came here looking for a cure ! I came here looking for time . That 's the thing : the more you have , the more you want . I can save your life ! If the plague is immortality ... then there 's only one cure . I wish you 'd change your mind . And I wish I could see Alan one more time . Jules ? Sarah ? where is my food come from ?

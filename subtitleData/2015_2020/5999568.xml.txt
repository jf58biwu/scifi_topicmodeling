 Previously on " agent carter " ... Peg , you work at the phone company . You know how busy the office keeps me . Agent carter , cover the phones . As of this moment , howard stark is a fugitive from justice . I have a vault . Somebody cleaned me out . My technology in the hands of some nut ? You have no idea how bad that could be . Edwin jarvis . He 'll help you in any way he can . [ synthesized ] leviathan is coming . Where are you ? ! Carter : Keep driving ! And now it 's time For " the captain america adventure program , " Brought to you by roxxon motor oil . Tonight 's thrilling tale Takes us deep into the heart of the ardennes forest , Where hitler 's nazi guard have ambushed the 107th infantry And taken betty carver , The battalion 's beautiful triage nurse ... [ train whistle blows ] ... As their hostage . You lousy krauts are in big trouble Once captain america gets here . When I 'm through with you , hitler , You 're gonna be seeing stars ... And stripes ! [ thumping ] Hitler : [ german accent ] nein ! You will bow down to the fuhrer ! Angie , would you mind changing that ? Arlene french beat me out for that part . [ jazz music plays ] " you lousy krauts are in big trouble Once captain america gets here . " It 's better , right ? Thrillingly realistic . ♪ take a look at what I 've found ♪ You moving ? I ... Uh , lost my roommate . [ chuckles ] my first place , I lived with this girl from queens . It was okay for maybe six months , And then - - bam ! - - One day , she 's engaged . Next day , she 's married and living in armonk . You think you know people . " cozy studio apartment . " that means it 's a broom closet . " convenient to public transportation " - - " you 'll be living under the third avenue el . " What would you suggest ? Girl down the hall from me just moved out . She was always crying to her mother on the hall phone . Yeah , maybe the first couple times . Anyway , it 's over on 63rd . It 's real safe , lots of great girls . Plus , I 'd be your neighbor , so that 's not nothing . It 's a lovely idea , but I 'd hate for you to grow tired of me . You don 't strike me as the " crying on the hall phone " type , english . I appreciate it , truly , but , um [ clears throat ] I 'm actually on my way to see an apartment now . You sure you 're reading the right kind of want ads ? It comes recommended through a friend . If you say so . [ classical music plays ] Jarvis : You presumably already noticed The north german renaissance influences , But the layout is decidedly french . Fresh fruit and scones served every morning . Ooh ! The chef likes a challenge , So you may order anything you like . I can 't stay . Mr. Stark insisted . He also wants me to clear his name On multiple charges of treason . If anyone finds out I 'm living in his house , I 'll be fitted for the noose . Well , if it puts you at your ease , This isn 't one of his primary residences . Mr. Stark uses this more for ... Private entertaining . [ muffled ] it 's too risky . Well , if you 're certain You wouldn 't like to see the master bedroom ... Ohhhh ! Russian sable , custom-made . Ohhhh . Perhaps one night . Splendid . Regarding our other matter , I checked through mr . Stark 's files But found no mention of leviathan . I couldn 't find anything at the ssr , either . What about the two gentlemen with the unusual ... ? New york hospitals have no record of laryngotomy patients Fitting those descriptions within the last three years . I think those quiet men are from out of town . Hmm . So , I 've got two foreign agents with no voice boxes Fighting over a milk truck full of experimental implosives . Just another day at the office . The daisy clover dairy opens at 5 : 00 . We need to find that milk truck . I 'll be standing by with a car at 10 to . You 've nearly been killed once , mr . Jarvis . Others have been less fortunate . I think it 's best I should carry on alone . Oh . On occasion , mr . Stark enjoys Adding a theatrical element to his romantic endeavors . Is that what he calls it ? Oh ! Yes , this could prove useful . Oh , don 't be lewd . [ static crackling ] [ bell dings ] Man : Come on , babe ! Move it ! [ indistinct talking in distance ] [ static crackling ] [ bell dings ] The maid arrives at 10 : 00 , the florist usually by noon . Cancel them both . And I shall ... Cancel them both . Good night , mr . Jarvis . [ doorknob jostles ] I do wish you 'd change your mind And allow me to accompany you . I can be your second pair of eyes . I can 't imagine there being much danger at the dairy hub . Whoever drove that truck is a man that needs questioning . And how do you plan to find it ? I held on to the vita-ray detector from project rebirth . From whatever truck was used to transport the nitramene . What ? It seems a tad conspicuous to walk into daisy clover And halt business to inspect for vita-radiation . I have far more tact than you give me credit - - Oh . Y-you 've popped a button . No . Good night , mr . Jarvis . Well , what 's the worst that can happen ? [ static crackling ] [ bell dings ] [ indistinct shouting in distance ] Man : Please ! I 'll tell you anything you want to know ! [ breathing heavily ] I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . [ groaning ] I swear to god - - I don 't know no leet brannis ! I-is it a person or a place ? [ breathing heavily ] [ static crackling ] [ bell dings ] [ grunts ] Oh , no . No , no , no . I told spider I didn 't want anything to do with that stuff . It 's too hot , too pricy . I told him gino delucia out in bensonhurst - - He 'd buy it . [ breathing heavily ] [ static crackling ] [ bell dings ] [ gasping ] [ silenced gunshot ] [ big-band music plays ] [ knife rings ] Man : Y 'all done there ? Man # 2 : Yeah . Carter : [ american accent ] excuse me ! Are you the foreman ? Ruth barton , city of new york health department . You heard of that ? I 've had 15 complaints that you are under direct violation Of city health provision 42 , article 23 - - I.E. , the care and transport of all milkstuffs . Complaints from who ? Right now , me . I have a court order to inspect all delivery trucks Let 's hope I don 't find cheese where the milk 's supposed to be . Now , you gonna help me or hinder me ? Help ? Good answer . [ sighs ] [ bottles clank ] [ indistinct shouting in distance ] [ device whirring ] [ buzzer ] [ sighs ] Well , we got a guy out sick the past two days . Has he never heard of a bus ? Name and address . Sheldon mcfee , but I don 't got an address . Leave that to me . And put some air in that tire ! Thompson : Well , here 's what 's left of roxxon . Dooley : Makes even less sense in the light of day . An entire chemical refinery squashed into that . I never seen anything like it . This is scary stuff , gentlemen - - The kind of technology That could give the a-bomb a run for its money . We need to find it fast . You think it 's magnets ? What ? You got steel fused with wood Fused with iron fused with concrete . Stone and wood don 't carry a magnetic charge . Well , excuse me , sir isaac newton . [ chuckles ] That 's gravity , you dumb ape . Well , what do you think did it ? I think howard stark did it . [ metal creaking ] Come on . We 're going to roxxon . Nobody burns down your house by accident . Not you , krzeminski . I got a special detail for a man with your skills . Grab a crowbar . Pull that thing apart . Find me some evidence . Krzeminski : Aw . You got to be kidding me . [ indistinct conversations ] I see . Perfect . Yes . Yes . Thank you . Whitby 's prospect , third race . You sure ? Not at all . That 's why they call it gambling . I need to pop out for a minute - - Personal matters . Sure thing , but you owe me one . Got that film developed for you . Hey , thanks a bunch . Photographer from the society pages Was at spider raymond 's club . Says he may have got a shot of the blonde Who was with spider before he got killed . [ camera shutter clicks ] Well , that would be a big break . Can I help you look ? I thought you were leaving . Sousa ! Need you in the basement . I got a 10-ton ball of roxxon garbage with your name on it . All right , all right , give me a minute . Carter , finish up those transpo reports And file them for me . Car-ter ! Transpo reports . Get wiggling . Looks like I 'm gonna miss that race . It 's probably for the best . Man : Yeah , uh , we just got the briefing . Yeah , not just , like , 10 minutes ago . We got two agents ... [ dial tone ] [ buzzer ] [ telephone rings , classical music plays ] Jarvis residence . I don 't have long , so listen very carefully . I need you to dispose of howard 's car . I beg your pardon ? The ssr are looking into roxxon at this very moment . That car sustained damage at the site And is likely to be teeming with vita-radiation . Make it disappear . [ sighs ] Very well . [ clears throat ] let 's see . The linens come out of the wash in 30 minutes - - Now . Fine . I shall forego the linens . Did you locate the dairy truck ? Not yet , but I did locate the driver . Sheldon mcfee uses the truck To commute from cedar grove , new jersey . Shall we leave straightaway ? No . There 's something I need to take care of here first . Jones : You know , we used to be friends , howard and I. Lunch at the club , Christmas parties , charity functions . To your very good health , gentlemen . It 's 10 : 45 in the morning . Ah . [ clears throat ] So , what came between you and stark ? My wife . Bit of a jump to go from that to industrial sabotage . Not the way he does it , from what I hear . So it 's personal , this attack ? It 's all the same with howard , As long as he 's amused and making money . He attempted to purchase that refinery As recently as January , But I refused . Now it 's a smoking crater - - Not to mention a federal crime scene . You tell me - - who benefits ? Any idea what stark may have used To cause this kind of damage ? [ sighs ] What is your interest regarding minor legal transgressions Not related to the red hook refinery ? Low . We 're not hunting you , mr . Jones . I have sources working in stark industries , And they told me that howard is working on a formula For molecular nitramene . Now , theoretically , it could result In a concussive blast followed by a vacuum implosion . Supposedly , it has its roots in his work with vita-radiation . Time-out . Vita-radiation ? [ indistinct conversation ] [ telephone ringing ] [ gasps ] [ ringing continues ] [ ringing stops ] [ tumbler clicking ] [ telephone ringing ] [ thud ] Oh ! Bloody hell . [ ringing continues ] [ breathing shakily ] [ ringing continues ] Hello ? Sousa . Uh ... No , I don 't see her . Okay , okay . Well , I 'll keep an eye out - - Here she is . She 's right - - she 's right here . Chief wants a word . [ clears throat ] Chief dooley ? Just stepped away . Uh , vita-radiation ? Yes , I think we have something for that In the project rebirth file . I 'll see if I can find it . What was that about ? Oh , just another errand . [ horn honks ] [ door closes ] carter . About time . Jones : Well . I didn 't know our government had such good taste in secretaries . What 's your name , darling ? " agent . " [ chuckles ] that has a lovely ring to it . As requested . I 'll meet you back at the office . Yeah , stick around . We could use your help . It wouldn 't be for filing , would it ? Turns out , anyone near the nitramene blast Which is probably still somewhereabouts on their person . So we 're scanning everyone on roxxon 's staff . There 's a chance this is an inside job . Yeah , there 's a chance I take rita hayworth home tonight , But it 's unlikely , if you catch my drift . If you got some of stark 's guys in your pocket , There 's a chance he 's got some of your guys in his . And how am I to help ? How comfortable are you with this ? You 'll be dealing with the ladies . I volunteered , But chief said it wouldn 't be appropriate . [ big-band music plays ] [ chuckles ] [ door opens , closes ] [ device humming ] [ device humming loudly ] [ humming continues ] [ device humming loudly ] [ humming stops ] [ humming resumes ] [ humming stops , resumes , stops , resumes ] Oh . [ click , humming stops ] [ inhales sharply ] Sorry , nana . [ device humming ] You 're clear . [ device humming ] Clear . Thank you . Next . Carter ? [ device squeals ] Aah ! [ snaps fingers ] carter ! [ device humming ] You 're clear . Wai- - uh , hold on a moment , sir . Excuse me . Sir ? Mr. Jones , I notice these men Are wearing company-issued uniforms . Do they change their clothes onsite ? For all the technicians who handle hazardous materials . What 's your point , carter ? Would barely saturate the top layer of a person 's skin . A hot shower would wash it out straightaway . But clothing would remain tainted for longer - - Trousers , shoes , even a wristwatch . I suggest we check the clothes the men wore to work this morning . Not a bad idea . We can - - Hey ! Hey ! Stop ! Where does that lead ? Down to the front lobby . Stairwell ? May I ? Thompson : I said stop ! Can I be of any further assistance ? [ handcuffs click ] [ sighs ] I 'm not gonna lie to you - - you 're in a bad spot . We have physical evidence linking you To an act of industrial sabotage and probably treason . With the type of charges being tossed around here , I can 't see you winding up anywhere Besides the electric chair . Of course ... You still do have the opportunity To switch seats with someone else . You see , fighting crime Is a lot like fishing with your buddies - - Biggest fish wins . No offense , but you 're not the biggest fish . Doesn 't mean you 're not plenty big enough For me to feed my bosses , But if you were to help me catch a bigger fish - - Say , a grouper or a shark - - I could see myself letting you off the line . I don 't believe you . Well , you should . I 'm in law enforcement . Thing is , mr . Van ert , We 're under a bit of an accelerated timeframe here - - Lot of pressure to get this case sewn up . So this deal that I 'm offering you will expire ... As soon as I leave the room . All you have to do Is point us in the direction of your employer . Just ... Give me ... A name . Just give me a name . Don 't say I didn 't try to do this the easy way . [ breathes deeply ] [ clears throat ] [ sniffs ] You can threaten me all you want , But I 'm not talking . I 'm not here to make you talk , miles . [ sniffs ] [ clears throat ] I 'm here to make you sing . You 're gonna want to bite down . [ breathing shakily ] [ grunting ] Hate to see what would 've happened If you 'd left the carrot . Carter , take off for the night . A lady shouldn 't be seeing this . You boys play nice . Talk . ♪ bum , bum , ba bum ♪ bum , bum , ba bum Oh , come on , mr . Jarvis . A penguin could get here faster . [ knock on window ] Angie : [ muffled ] I found one ! I 'm late for my appointment ! It has its own bathroom . I - - I 've no idea what you 're saying . Don 't make me come out there . Angie , I really must - - " a safe community for modern female professionals . " 550 square feet , furnished , full bath , " high floors , quiet building , security assured . " close proximity to the lexington avenue local . Continental breakfast upon request . " Paradise or what ? That sounds perfect . The only thing that could possibly make it better Is if you lived next to me . Oops ! You would . 3c if you need a cup of sugar . I really shouldn 't , angie . Am I missing something here ? You need a place , this one is great , so ... I 'm thinking maybe it 's me . I 'm afraid I wouldn 't make a very good neighbor . [ horn honks ] Oh . That 's my ride . I 'll see you later . Too late ! [ car door closes ] [ engine turns over ] Miss carter . Mr. Jarvis . [ fanfare ] Meanwhile , in the snowy mountains of the eastern alps , Battalion triage nurse betty carver tidies up While the men defend their country . What a beautiful day to mend these pants . And my new singer featherweight 221 sewing machine Makes stitching so easy . [ thud ] Oh , no . Nazis ! Again ! They 've got me all tied up ! If only captain america were here to rescue me . Who writes this rubbish ? [ click ] I rather enjoy it , actually . Although , the - - the real thing Is considerably more impressive . Are you trying to butter me up , mr . Jarvis ? Merely pleased to receive your call . Well , you are faster than a train . How flattering . It 's very nice . I left it in hoboken with the keys in the ignition . I don 't imagine it 's still there . It did seem a terrible waste , though . It waused in the commission of a crime . One doesn 't park that sort of thing in a garage . Cedar grove . Aptly named . You might hurry . We don 't have much time . I 'm afraid agent thompson can be rather persuasive . We 're gonna need a new stick . Immigration has no record of a " leet brannis " Ever entering the country . If it is , our friend in there doesn 't know it . He wasn 't holding anything back . We get anything on the milk-truck driver ? He didn 't sound like he was the brains of the operation , anyway . More like the krzeminski of the operation . Joke 's on you , peg leg . I don 't even know how to drive a truck . Driver may be a lead , but this guy brannis is the key . I pressed van ert pretty hard in there on howard stark . I don 't think he ever met him . Stark could have go-betweens between his go-betweens . If this guy brannis is calling the shots on this deal , I 'm telling you , he 's our direct link to stark . I got the milk-truck driver . Sheldon mcfee , 4 springhill road , Cedar grove , new jersey . Hot damn . Let 's go , boys . [ knife rings ] [ bell dings ] Carter : Down the road . Pull up by the side . [ dog barks in distance ] [ sighs ] and here we are again . Fewer guards than roxxon , at least . Shall I leave the engine running In case you trigger another implosion ? If you leave now , you may even catch the end of benny goodman . Miss carter , when you called me , I assumed it was because you needed more than a cab . I thought I proved rather useful last time . I agree , but on this occasion ... I 've got my own ride home . [ radio tuning ] [ fanfare ] To " the captain america adventure program , " In which our hero 's defenseless sweetheart Finds herself in the clutches of evil . Nazi : American women are so weak ! You are coming with us ! Carver : If only captain america were here to rescue me . Captain america : Miss carver isn 't going anywhere with you , nazi scum . Seize him ! Unhand her ! [ thumping ] Hit him again , cap ! [ both grunting ] [ rattling ] Had enough yet ? [ crack ] [ clatter ] Are you all right , miss carver ? Is that all you 've got ? Hello ? Mr. Mcfee ? Captain america , what would I ever do without you ? Why does this keep happening ? Getting straight answers out of people nowadays . Whatever happened to a nice cup of tea And a civilized interrogation ? [ door creaks ] [ engine sputtering ] Get out . Car trouble ? Nothing that can 't be fixed . What the hell are you doing here ? Mr. Stark asked me to help you , and so I have . I sabotaged the motor . Move , and I shoot . I thought you 'd be more impressed . Well , I 'm not . I told you I don 't need your help . An ideal butler provides service without being asked . [ scoffs ] put it back . I need to drive this thing of here . [ sighs ] won 't be a moment . Where are stark 's inventions ? [ scoffs ] [ click , speech synthesizer hums ] I want protection . The ssr will take you in , Provided that you say something interesting Right bloody now . Psst ! Ask him about leviathan . Who is leviathan ? Not who - - what . Your employers ? Not anymore . So leviathan sent you to rob howard stark 's vault ? And you double-crossed them ? Well , that seems incredibly brave or incredibly stupid . Leviathan only wanted one thing from howard stark . Well , fetch mr . Mcfee . I need to take him in , too . What was the one thing ? What was leviathan after ? I want ... Protection . Then start ... Talking . [ door closes ] [ breathing heavily ] Uh , bit of a snag , actually . I 'm afraid mr . Mcfee 's left the premises . I did find this . Mm . Don 't shoot yourself in the face . Get in the truck . Comfortable back there , mr . Jarvis ? Perfectly , thank you . These racks of explosives Have distracted me from the smell of stale milk . You did say you wanted to help . Take the lincoln tunnel back to manhattan . And stop fidgeting . Nothing 's going to happen . [ thud ] Did either of you hear that ? [ silenced gunshot , bullet ricochets ] Well , I definitely heard that ! Shake him loose ! [ engine revs ] Aah ! Shoot up ! ♪ he 's a mellow fellow ♪ Chief . ♪ he always plays the rhythm , so we call him the swing man ♪ Well , that 's suspicious . ♪ he really loves his music ♪ [ panting ] ♪ busy as a bee ♪ ♪ and when he starts a-muggin ' , you just shout " mercy me " ♪ ♪ the whole darn world goes mad when he starts ♪ ♪ and he 's a killer-diller ♪ ♪ never missed a beat , he 'll swing you out your seat ♪ ♪ there 's a reason why ♪ [ grunts ] Pull over ! If you do not pull over this instant , I will have no choice but to shoot you ! [ gasps ] For god 's sake , will you please stop shooting things ? ! [ tires screech ] Oh ! [ gasps ] [ high-pitched whining ] Do I even need to ask ? Ask what ? Yeah , I guess you 're right . I used to strap a chair to my ass And take long walks around the neighborhood , too . We know who you are , mr . Mcfee . We were on our way to pay you a visit . So , who did this to you ? Was it leet brannis ? We know he paid you off to use the truck . You 're in deep water . I 'd take that life preserver , if I was you . You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . We 'll keep an open mind . [ whining continues ] miss carter ! I hear it ! Get brannis ! Jump clear ! What ? ! [ grunting ] This is where I get off . [ grunting ] Aah ! [ gasps ] [ groans ] What the hell is that ? Thompson , step on it . [ panting ] Jarvis : Are you all right ? I 'm fine . You ? Yes , I ... I 'm afraid mr . Brannis broke my fall . The rest of the weapons that you stole from howard - - I need to find out where you hid them . You 're the only one who knows . I need to find those weapons before - - Leviathan is coming . Help me stop them . [ wheezing ] M-mr . Brannis , what is that - - a heart ? [ groans ] Mr. Brannis - - [ siren wailing in distance ] Where is the car ? It 's that way . I think we should retrieve it immediately . Miss carter , please . Allow me . [ siren continues ] I used to come skinny-dipping here as a kid . That 's a sight . Somebody knows what we know before we know it , And it 's really starting to chap my ass . We can pick you up some baby powder for you on the way back . Maybe that 'll help . We got footprints - - a woman 's . She was with him till he died . Or up until she popped him herself . Got to be the broad who cuffed fatty to his chair . Could be that blonde at the nightclub . We ever get a look at her ? Pictures were sousa 's detail . What the hell is he doing ? Sousa . What the hell are you doing ? [ horn honks ] [ inhales sharply ] You 're quite good at that . Yes , mr . Stark 's zippers are under considerable strain . You 're very fortunate , you know . He missed the bone by 3 inches . Then look me in the eye and say what you meant . You 're very fortunate that I ignored your instructions . How I managed to stay alive before I met you , I can 't tell if you 're being arrogant or ignorant . Both , I imagine . Your line of work requires support - - People who care about your well-being , Who 'll be there to stitch up your wounds . If I allow people to get close to me , I 'm putting them in danger . So your solution is to remove yourself From the world you wish to protect ? Where 's the sense in that ? There is not a man or woman , No matter how fit he or she may be , who is capable Of carrying the entire world on their shoulders . Steve was . From what mr . Stark has told me , Captain rogers relied heavily on you - - For courage , strategy , and moral guidance . You were his support . Your desire to help others is noble . But I doubt you 'll find much success Unless you allow others to help you . [ breathes deeply ] As you were . [ sighs ] [ inhales sharply ] [ big-band music plays ] Hi , mary . Hi . That 's mary - - she 's a legal secretary At goodman , kurtzberg , and holliway . Evelyn is a lounge singer at a club in midtown . Hi , sarah . Hi . That 's sarah . She 's a slut . I am so happy you changed your mind . You 're gonna love living here . I 've never rented a flat that required an interview . It 's just a formality . You 'll ace it . Miriam 's a total pussycat . [ ballad plays ] Your references are impeccable . Senator palmer is especially complimentary . He and my father were dear friends . Were you limping as you came in ? Caught my heel on a cobblestone . You know how the west village is . I never travel below 23rd street , So no , I do not . How long do you see yourself Working for the telephone company ? Only until I 'm married , miss fry . In a city filled with temptation , The griffith hotel is a haven for proper young ladies . Our code of conduct is indisputable . Attire should be demure and elegant . Curfew is 10 : 00 . No drinking . No men above the first floor . No exceptions . Is that clear , miss carter ? Perfectly . [ chuckles softly ] Dooley : That is it . Show him , sousa . Right there . We 're right . Show that other photo . Not even close . That right there - - that 's the angle . Don 't back off , okay ? I 'm telling you . Carter , come here for a second . Come here , come here , come here . [ clears throat ] Settle a bet for us . Is that joe dimaggio ? I don 't follow boxing . [ laughing ] aww ! Krzeminski : I told you she wouldn 't know who dimaggio was . I still say it 's him . If I was in the same room as joe dimaggio . How do you figure ? I would sense his presence . Ah , get outta here . You bet against me ? How could you be sure ? I wasn 't . That 's why they call it gambling . [ chuckles ] Did you , um , spot anyone else ? Nothing definitive , but we got a couple shots of the blonde . She really knows how to duck a camera . Not one clear shot of her face . Tough break . Nobody 's lucky forever . I 'll find her . Mm . [ fanfare ] Once again , the powers of freedom and democracy prevail . I 'm so lucky to have a man As brave and strong as captain america . Nazi : Not so fast , captain america . I still have a few tricks up my sleeve . You 'll never be able to defeat my secret weapon . What on earth could that be ? Announcer : And that concludes tonight 's episode Of " the captain america adventure program " ! Be sure to tune in next week for another thrilling tale ... Dooley : You find something , krzeminski ? Yeah . Think I found something big .

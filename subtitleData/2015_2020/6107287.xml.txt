 Peter : Previously on helix ... I ate all of it . Now i 'm sick . You must decide what kind of man you want to be One who fears , or one who inspires fear . Right now , we have a job to do . Loose ends that need to be tied up . None of them can leave the island . ( grunts ) Woo ! Looks like i got me a big one ! Ooh ... ( groaning ) Ilaria 's planning to release a new version of narvik worldwide . When ? Two days . Contact your superiors . I 'm not getting any response . Where 's mother ? 150 yards north of the main gate . Am i looking at a rescue ? Just the opposite . They 're going to kill everything on the island . ( engines roaring ) ( gas hissing ) ( gagging ) peter ! ( choking ) You cheated me ! Sarah : You found mother ! Julia : Oh , no , it 's dead ! Now the rest of the world 's going to be dead , too . ( grunting ) ( the flower duet from lakme playing ) ( screaming ) There 's no going back now . Why would you want to ? What has the world outside ever given to you ? Nothing . Less than nothing . I wanted to be a healer . That 's your past talking . You 're so much more than that now . You have shed your old clothing along with your old life . You 're reborn now . Ascendant . Under your guidance , we will prevail . We will take back our abbey . Our island . Why stop there ? The outside world is soul-sick , anne . Why not heal it ? We can expand our reach all the way to the mainland . The island has always been our home . That 's your past talking . First , we need to break the naval blockade . What we lack is leverage . We need to control something they want . How ? We 're trapped here . Trapped with the cdc . They 've discovered a cure for mycosis . We need to get our hands on that cure . Then we eliminate them . Ow ... Stings a bit . It 's better than the alternative . What 's this for ? You need it worse than i do . Coast guard needs it , too . Get it off the island . I ... I don 't know what to say . I mean , i tried to kill you yesterday . That wasn 't you . It was the pathogen . I was wrong about you . I used to think there was a right and a wrong , No in between ... But immortality turned all that upside-down . If i were you , i 'd forget i ever set foot on this island . Can 't do that . When this is all over , I still got to turn you in . I tell you what , i 'll make you a deal . When this is all over , i 'll turn myself in . But first i need a favor . All right . I need to borrow your gun . And i need to know what happened in paris . First bank of atlanta . Safety deposit box 274 . You 'll find all the proof you need . Mother 's dead . No fungal antigens nothing . You could try an ammonium nitrogen-based fertilizer . That would take a month . I 've only got one day before the narvik release . Did you hear what i said ? Sorry , what ? Nothing . Just the end of the human race as we know it . You 'll figure something out . You always do . What is that ? Homemade fluorocarbon . Highly oxygenated , breathable . It 's similar to what dr . Adrian was using on peter To keep him alive at abs , And i think it might work here . For how long ? Indefinitely , as long as he is receiving fresh infusions every 30 minutes . You 're going to inject fluid into that jar every half hour For the rest of your life ? If i have to . ( door opening ) Alan : Jules ? Oh , my god ... Is that ... Our child ? Why don 't i , uh , Let you two have some time alone ? Julia : So that 's where the root came from . Anne : The mother tree . She 's the reason we 're on this island . Michael discovered her so many years ago . Her root system contained amazing medicinal properties . Like infertility ? Michael spent decades studying her . After she died , he took pieces of the root And grafted them onto other plantings . The piece that was lost was the last remnant Of the original tree . I need to go to the tree 's location . There may be viable seeds or pieces of root left behind . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . I know it 's a long shot , but i have to try ! You misunderstand . I 'd take you there if i could . Michael was the only one who knew its location . But this painting ... ... Is nearly 300 years old . It 's a view from a hill near the abbey , But the tree is long gone . There must be some record . You 're welcome to look through michael 's ledgers , Provided you have eli 's permission . Who 's eli ? Eli , Dr. Walker would like a word . ( inhaling deeply ) ( laughing ) What the hell ? Ha ! Peter ! Where are your clothes ? Peter is dead . This is eli , the new leader of our order . Eli ... All right , you 're kidding , right ? A new man deserves a new name . Eli means " ascendant " in ... I don 't care what it means . Peter , You 're a doctor . Are you going to throw away everything for this ? I found a higher calling , A sense of purpose , a place to belong ... Much like you did . All right , eli ... I need full access to michael 's records . That won 't be a problem , As long as we get something in return . I already offered you immunity from ilaria . I want the same for my followers . Ilaria stays off this island . No persecution , no narvik , nothing . I can arrange that . Plus a royalty on the sale of the infertility apples . 10 per cent . Make it 20 ! Oh , come on ! ( sighing ) It looks like you 're still peter after all , hmm ? He 's been fed . It 's time for his nap . Anne ... Gather the followers in the council hall . Have them arm themselves . It 's time to take care of our cdc problem . ( baby cooing ) Anne : Yes , eli . ( theme music playing ) You sure you 're okay , dr . Connor ? I 'm fine , soren . Gotta get to the lab , help dr . Jordan . But what about your my ... Uh ... Mycosis ? Yeah ! I 'm getting better , just like you did . Dr. Alan fixed me . I want to fix people , too . Is that right ? Yeah . I can come work with you at the cdc . I 'd have you on my team anytime . Soren , i need to talk to dr . Kyle alone . But i 'm helping him . Now ! Don 't back talk me . You need to get out of here now . Out of where ? The island . Get as far away as you can . Believe me , i 'm trying . What 's going on ? I don 't want him to kill dr . Alan , you and dr . Jordan . Him who ? Eli ! Peter ! He won 't let you leave the island alive . You heard him say that ? He wants the cure , and once he gets it , You 're going to end up in a barrel . I found this . There 's a coastguard radio in there . Call for help . Do whatever , just get off the island ! Why are you telling me this ? You saved my soren . You , and dr . Alan . Alan : It doesn 't seem possible . There 's no scientific evidence to explain it , but ... Not yet . But it doesn 't matter how . The fact is that he 's alive in this jar , And i need to find a way to get him off this island . What kind of life Is he going to have ? I don 't know , but i am willing to spend an eternity To figure out a way for him to have a normal life . Why don 't you come with me ? If there 's anybody who can help me figure this out , it 's you . Sarah , i ... I can 't . You can 't . He 's your son , too . But you can 't , because of your obsession With ilaria and killing immortals . Well , why don 't you start with me , alan ? I 'm standing here right in front of you . I have to finish what i started . I should have told you i was going to see dr . Kyle . No , no , no soren , You didn 't do anything wrong . Now i need you to listen to me . Mommy made a terrible mistake . What did you do ? I can 't explain right now , But i 'm trying to fix it , so i need you to do something for me . Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek , That spot you used to hide ? But i don 't want to hide . Dr. Kyle 's my friend . I can help , too . You can help by staying out of sight . Soren , Promise me . I promise . ( gasping ) You scared me . I figured i 'd find you up here , Pouring through 500 years of clues . Believe me , there 's not much to find . What do you want , alan ? Actually , i came to apologize . I came at you pretty hard yesterday . It was unfair . I appreciate that . I 'd like to help . Find anything of use ? Uh ... I 'm not sure yet . This is a painting of the mother tree . I might be able to use reference points to determine its location . Assuming the painting 's true to life . We have no way of knowing if it 's accurate . Well , michael was a geneticist , But over the centuries , he was also an artist , A cartographer and an astronomer . The man had a lot of time on his hands . Landscapes change , Mountains erode , and , uh , forests die , But one thing stays the same ... The stars . Do you remember that weekend in yosemite ? With the leaky tent . You said there was a way to use astronomical coordinates To determine a precise location . Declination and ascension , yeah . Right . You were showing off . I was trying to show you Where ansel adams shot autumn moon . You were trying to get me back in the tent . What if there 's a way to compare the stars in the sky To the stars in the painting ? It 's a good theory , but we have no idea when this was painted . No , but that might only be the difference of a few degrees . It could still give us an idea of the tree 's location . It 's good work . ( chuckling ) yeah . The work 's just getting started . Sarah ! Thank god you 're here ! We gotta pack up and get out . What the hell is that ? It 's my son . Your what ? When were you pregnant ? It was a ... No , stop . You know what ? You can explain it to me on the way . Nothing on this island surprises me anymore . No , i 'm not going anywhere . Sarah , please ! They 're coming to kill us . Who ? Peter 's gone off the deep end . We gotta call for an evac Or we 're going to be scattered in that boneyard . ( sighs ) Come on , sarah , we gotta go ! Don 't rush me . Sarah , come on , please ! Do not rush me ! Too late . Gotta go . ( slamming ) Kyle , stop ! We gotta keep moving . What 's wrong ? Something 's leaking onto my back . No ... It 's leaking ! What ... What are you doing ? Juicy fruit . There is no substitute . Did this with my fishbowl back home . Your fish was named copernicus , mine was eggman . Figures . Yeah , that 'll hold for a while . We gotta get the hell up there , call for an evac . No , no , he can 't live inside a cracked jar . I have to get him a new one . Well , where do you think we 're going to find that ? Amy said there are more jars inside the abbey , And since she 's currently indisposed , i have to find anne . Come on , you gotta be kidding . You can go if you want . I 'm not going to stop you , But if i don 't get him another jar in 30 minutes he 's going to die . Okay . We 'll split up and find anne . Meet back here in 30 minutes . No , kyle , you don 't have to . I 'm not leaving without you or your son . Alan : Can barely recognize this place . It 'll take time , but the island will heal . Incredible what nature can do when left alone . Is that another ilaria save the planet talking point ? Look out there , alan . It 's the hand of man . It 's what we do best , isn 't it ? Take something beautiful then destroy it . And ilaria never destroyed anything . Only in service of the greater good . Jesus ! You can 't believe that , can you ? Alan , It doesn 't matter what i believe . There 's no defeating ilaria . They are everywhere , in every major city , In every branch of government . I 've seen their plans . Has it ever occurred to you That they might be lying ? About what ? Narvik-c ? Think about it , jules . Hatake needed several lifetimes to do what some genius At ilaria perfected in under a year ? Wow . It 's not just the beard . You 've really gone full conspiracy theorist . Look ... I know this can 't be easy for you . It wasn 't easy for me , either . That 's the thing . It was too easy . I killed all those immortals for you , jules , And i 'd have killed 10 000 more . For you . You were the one , alan . You 're the closest i came to knowing anyone And i tried to let you know me , too , But there was just something missing . I was missing . No . It wasn 't you . I know you want to believe you could have done something to change things . It 's me . It 's what i am . My father hatake , immortality ... Arctic biosystems was the worst And best thing that ever happened to me , Because i finally made sense . ( baby cooing ) ( whispering ) he 's asleep . The cdc doctors have fled . And the cure ? We scoured the entire lab . They must have taken it with them . I 'm so sorry ... I should have known . Don 't apologize . I 'm not michael . You could never disappoint me . Someone must have warned them . But who would do such a thing ? No one else ... Olivia . She was in the room with us . What do you want me to do ? Keep the search going for the cdc . I 'll handle everything else . Show no mercy . Show no mercy . Julia : Okay , where are you , polaris ? Right in the big dipper , And from those two pointer stars , five times the distance . There she is . The north star . This can 't be right . Well , maybe it 's just a painting , jules . I combed through michael 's files for hours . He was meticulous about his work ... Almost obsessive . Why would he be different on this ? So we have the star . Where 's the hill ? It 's there . It 's almost as if ... Oh ! I assumed we were at the vantage point , but i got it backwards . The star , the hill ... The triangulation point is ... It 's at the steeple ! The tree 's here , at the abbey ! ( muffled voices ) Woman : Maybe there 's someone over here . Man : All clear ! ( approaching footsteps ) Eli ! ( lamp rattling ) You seem nervous , olivia . Is anything wrong ? No ! I just really want to find my soren , Make sure he 's okay . If you care about your son , Why risk everything by telling the cdc we were coming for them ? No , eli . I would never betray you . There 's no need to lie . That will only make it worse . ( screaming ) ( glass smashing ) Please , i just want to be with my son ! Please , i just want to be with him ! I know you do . ( olivia choking ) Olivia ... I know . ( neck cracking ) ( short gasp ) ( soren sobbing ) kyle : I 'm sorry , But we gotta go before they come back . ( sighs ) Soren ... Why did he kill my mom ? No reason . He 's just an evil man who did a terrible thing . He 's a doctor like you . He 's supposed to fix people ! Sometimes people pretend to be someone they 're not . I don 't want to pretend . I want to be someone else . Hey , no one deserves what you 've been through . And after all i did to you , you still saved me and alan . I 'd say that makes you the bravest person i 've ever met . I 'm not brave . I could have saved her , but i was too scared . Soren , you listen to me . Listen , none of this is your fault . You hear me ? None of it . I lost my mom , too , When i was just a few years older than you . I still think about her every day . That wish is always with me , no matter what . But my mom was my only family And now i 'm all alone . I 'll be your family now , if you want . I 'll check over here . Take this side . They 're not here . Split up and circle the grounds . The doctors can 't have gone far . ( object clattering ) Put it down . Not one word . I understand . Now what do you want , dr . Jordan ? Michael 's premature baby experiments , Where are the life support units ? Why ? Because i 'm the one holding the knife . There 's no need to threaten me , just settle down . Sit . Where are they ? If i refuse to say ... You 're going to tell me one way or another . Julia : This place is so beautiful . Michael built himself a shrine to mother nature . It 's hard to believe somebody capable of so much beauty Could be responsible for so many horrors . More common than you 'd think . What was he like , michael ? What kind of man was he ? Loved the sound of his own voice . A narcissist ? A lunatic . He did have a gift for words , all right . Hell for michael was a room without an audience . Jules ... What are we doing ? The tree 's not here . Is this where he would speak ? He called it " counseling " . ( floor making crunching noise ) ( bag dropping ) Jules , what the hell are you ... ( slamming ) ( hammering ) ( wood splitting ) Help me ! Help you what ? Help me pull up this floor . ( wood cracking ) The mother tree ... Michael built the abbey right on top of it ! He must have had some way to access its roots . There 's an extensive tunnel system under the abbey , But we don 't have a painting to guide us . Good thing i have you ! Where are they ? If you turn yourself over to eli , He may show you mercy . Who 's eli ? I believe you knew him as peter farragut . ( scoffs ) Peter is a lot of things . And he will be so much more to so many people . You 're serious ? It 's no wonder that amy turned out the way that she did . You have no idea what it is to be a parent . I am a parent . No , you 're not . That thing over there is not a child . Shut up ! And keeping it like that is cruel and pointless . If i hear one more word out of your mouth That isn 't the location of those jars ... Why don 't you put that away ? We both know you won 't use it ! Oh , really ? ( screaming ) ( strange breathing ) What the hell is this place ? Anne : ( weakly ) this is where michael bestowed His greatest gift upon the world . The gift of life . ( gasping and breathing ) ( gasping ) What have you done to them , their throats , their voices ? Only in silence could they find peace . ( groaning and gasping ) Where are the life support units ? Where are they ? ( sighing ) Release them . All of them . I will not . You can do it with half your toes or none at all . ( gasping ) ( strangled gurgling ) Peter : When i was a boy , I used to dream they made a mistake at the hospital , That they switched babies . I used to pray that ... That i didn 't actually belong to that family , To that man . Now i understand that blood is meaningless . ( baby cooing ) You are my son , My family . Years at med school couldn 't teach me What you did in just one day . Dna , rna , The building blocks ... That 's not what it is to be human , What it means to be a man , A father . ( baby cooing ) It 's all the things we can 't see That make us who we are . Love , hope . I want to give you everything my father didn 't give me . Blood is meaningless . Family Is everything . ( julia grunting ) Oh , my god ! This is unbelievable . We 're inside the root system of a tree . Come on ... The tree 's dead , jules . Probably been dead for generations . An organism this big ? There are root systems that have been alive for 80,000 years . Trees , not stumps ! We 're too late . ( vials clinking ) ( gasping ) ( glass shattering ) Mayday , mayday , this is dr . Kyle summer with the cdc . Requesting immediate evacuation from st . Germain island . Do you copy ? ( radio producing static ) Mayday , mayday , this is dr . Kyle summer with the ... Sarah ! Did you find anne ? I found her . Did you get her to talk ? She talked . What happened ? Whose blood is that ? I 'll tell you after about five years of therapy . Mayday , mayday , this is dr . Kyle summer With the cdc requesting immediate evacuation From st . Germain island . Does anybody copy ? ( static crackling ) Man : This is the uss portledge , You 're on a priority military channel . Sign off immediately . This is dr . Kyle summer . We need an evac ! I don 't care who you are , switch your frequency ! Listen up ! I have a cure for the pathogen that 's infecting your ships , So if you want it , you better put somebody on the line That can get me an evac ! Hold for captain wilson . ( dragging footsteps ) ( labored breathing ) ( gasping ) Anne ! Oh , my god ... ( groaning ) What happened ? Who did this to you ? Who ? ( weakly ) dr . Jordan . Sarah ? She made me take her to the birthing chamber . We need to get you to the infirmary . No ! You have to stop her and dr . Summer . They 're trying to leave the island . Where are they now ? ( helicopter whirring ) Julia : No , no , no , no ! Alan : What happened ? The test vials are broken . I don 't have any more . Well then , there 's nothing you can do . Look , Do you see this ? The fungal enzyme , it spilled into the ground . Do you know what this means ? It 's mother ! She 's everywhere ! ( wind howling ) All right , soren , you 'll go first , then you , sarah . ( gunshots fired ) Pilot : We 're taking fire ! Everyone , hang on ! Kyle : No ! Hey , come back ! Soren : Come back ! Come back ! The fungus , it ... It 's in the soil around the roots . But you don 't have the root . I don 't need it . Mother was just a repository for the fungus . With modern gene splicing , We can insert the fungus into any plant we want . We can create widespread infertility Without any mycotic effects . This is incredible . We can create seeds , plantings , Whole orchards in the span of a few years . This will eliminate the need for narvik . ( cocking gun ) I 'm sorry , jules . Alan , what are you doing ? Stopping ilaria . By killing me ? I 'm trying to stop them , too . No . If you do this , you 're as bad as they are . Alan , you 're making a huge mistake . Please . You have to let me go . I can 't . ( gunshot fired ) ( theme music playing )

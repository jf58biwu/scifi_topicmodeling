 NARRATOR : Previously on Zoo : MITCH : I believe that if we introduce the Mother Cell into the DNA of a mutated animal we could possibly synthesize a cure . But here 's the problem . In order to do that , we need an animal who has mutated and has not been exposed to the Mother Cell . What if your dad was searching for a cure ? - Leopards ? - Have we ruled it out yet ? Zambia 's largest agricultural company is owned by one of Reiden 's biggest critics . That might explain why Reiden products aren 't being used there . I think we just found our needle . - We need to get out of the country . - How soon do you need to leave ? When an army wants to take an area they attack in a haphazard fashion . It causes fear . What , are you telling me that leopards are using military strategy ? They 're working as a group . They 're thinking as a group . JAMIE : Mitch stuck the cub with the needle . His pain sent a distress call . It was like the lions in L.A. They communicate over distances . This guy saved our lives . Once we get him back to a lab , he 's gonna save a lot more than that . - The cure ? ABRAHAM : It worked . You were right . I wanna thank you . - You don 't have to thank me . - I wanna thank you for giving me the courage to save my daughter . Truth is , you kind of saved me . SAGE : My name is Amelia Sage . Those scientists didn 't believe you , but I do . What about my colleagues ? SAGE : They 're safe , on a plane coming back to the United States . [ PLANE THUDS , THEN ALL SCREAMING ] Ripped By mstoll [ WOMAN WHIMPERING ] [ SCREAMS ] [ GRUNTS , THEN GROANING ] Who are you ? Where am I ? [ SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] What ? I don 't know what you 're saying . I was on a plane . There were other people with me . Do you know where they are ? Are they okay ? There was a , um ... A leopard . A small leopard cub . It 's very important that I find him . Is he okay ? Do you understand me ? You don 't understand me . What ... ? Oh , my God . How long have I been here ? I need to find a phone . I need to make a phone call . A phone call . I need a phone . Can you help me find a phone ? Can you help me ? Please . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ SHOUTING ] [ BEAR ROARING ] [ DOG BARKING ] [ SHOUTING ] You were protecting me . You were protecting me . The Canadian government called off the dive teams last week . Forty-seven people lost in the crash along with the cure . So we need to find an alternative . Something we 've overlooked . Chloe ... Chloe and I have been granted official clearance Some made-up titles and a team . International team arrived in Zambia today . Uh , the situation they report there is , well , dire . Mass evacuation . General panic . Very important people arrived today . A multinational team of crisis managers with their very important scientists . So , apparently , they don 't need me anymore . You know , because ... I ... Maybe they just don 't wanna be associated with failure . When we first assembled , I think we were all pretty dubious . No one more than me . Do you have any thoughts about Reiden Global ? Why would I have any thoughts about Reiden Global ? Dalton , can I get a ... ? Just about the rumors floating around that Reiden cut a deal with the government . What kind of deal ? To provide your now-famous Mother Cell in an effort to concoct the cure . Why would they do that ? Well , because in return the government agreed to indemnify Reiden and all of its corporate holdings from any malfeasance in connection with the ... Yeah . They still haven 't come up with an adequate name for it , have they ? Maybe you should come up with one . That 'd put you on the journalistic map , wouldn 't it ? How about the Beast Rebellion ? That 's pretty good , no ? Well , the rumors don 't end there . There 's talk that you and the other three were forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement in exchange for prosecutorial immunity from the crimes that were committed during the course of your - adventure . - Okay . This isn 't just a puff piece on the gentleman scientist who almost saved the world , is it ? Not really , no . And Jamie Campbell . What about her ? Well , this was her white whale , wasn 't it ? Her obsession ? Reiden ? That would be tragic , wouldn 't it ? All she wanted to do was bring down Reiden . Expose the truth . And she did . She died doing it . And now here I am . Here we are . We can 't say a thing , which means all she ever really cared about essentially died with her , didn 't it ? Is it true ? Have you been silenced ? - She was a reporter too . - I know . And the thing that made her a good reporter was that she understood tenacity and compassion don 't have to be mutually exclusive . - I didn 't mean ... - I know . You should go . Maybe you can get one of those urban transport thugs to bring you home . What with the Beast Rebellion and all . Okay . Tell me one last thing . Would you say that all hope is lost ? That things are only gonna get worse ? Is all hope in fact lost ? [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] MAN : Everyone should consult their watch lists . Reports have that those animals that busted out of the zoo are congregating in the northeast . Anacostia Park has just been upgraded to a five . - Back in black , mammy-rammers . - How 'd it go ? Got the bride to the church on time . Not without a struggle though . Georgetown is thick with boars . Never seen so many on one run . You got bit ? I did . But you ain 't seen the other guy yet . Victor Holman . Taking him from home to GW Hospital and back . Take a real gun tonight , Abe . That part of Pennsylvania Ave . Around GW Hospital has seen unusually heavy activity . I 'll be okay . All I require is the tranq . It 's not a question of whether or not you 'll be okay . They pay us for a service . They pay us for safety and pacifist beliefs ain 't gonna protect them from what 's out there . Mr. Holman will be just fine . CHLOE : Seventeen thousand casualties worldwide , not to mention countless injuries . I 'm sorry , but killing all the animals , that 's completely insane . Which is why we need to give them an alternative . Miss Sage ? - Yes . - The team from Zambia just radioed . - They found the leopards ? - Yes , ma 'am , that 's right . They 've been tracking the pride since this morning . They 're about to deploy a unit to capture them . There 's your alternative . Is that our team ? They 're in an abandoned flea market just north of Lusaka . Orange are the leopards . MAN : Having trouble with the cam . WOMAN : Switching to comm sat 1-9 . - Do you have audio ? - That 's what I 'm doing . MAN 1 [ OVER COMM ] : I see them , 30 yards ahead . PASCAL : Copy that . I 'm moving in . - That 's your agent ? Yes , Pascal . He 's embedded with the team . MAN 1 : Oh , my God . PASCAL : They spotted us . They 're running . Go , don 't lose them . MAN 2 : Targets dispersing . - Come on , you can cut it off . MAN 2 : Fan out , fan out . MAN 1 : Moving in . On your ten . MAN 2 : Target tranqed . I see it . - We 'll cut it off . MAN 1 : I got one , due south . - We can cut it off . PASCAL : Go , go . MAN 1 : Moving in . MAN 2 : I see it . MAN 1 : Go , go , go . PASCAL : Copy . [ LEOPARD GROWLING OVER COMM ] [ GUNFIRE OVER COMM ] MAN 1 : I got one ! PASCAL : Target tranqed . [ SCREECHING OVER COMM ] You hear that ? It 's birds . They 're going to attack . You have to warn them . They 're in trouble . They need your help . Tell them . Do it . This is D.C. We believe you have incoming . Possibly birds . - Tell them to get to cover . - You need to seek cover . MAN : Let 's get a wider visual . WOMAN : Sending to main monitors . I 've got the helmet-cam feed . [ BIRDS SCREECHING AND MEN SHOUTING OVER COMM ] MAN 1 [ OVER COMM ] : Keep your heads down ! Tell them to go east . Head due east . There 's a structure . MAN 2 : Wrong way ! Wrong way , back up , back up ! [ GUNFIRE OVER COMM ] PASCAL : Take cover ! Take cover ! Oh , God . They need to find an exit . PASCAL : D.C. , we 're okay , we have the leopard . MAN 1 : Sir , we got the leopard . - Well done . MAN 2 : Copy that . They found the leopards . Chloe just called . It 's been three months since the team in Zambia started looking for them , 86 days to be exact . And then , an hour ago , they did it . They captured one of them . Now , once they return home the plans are in place to synthesize the cure on a mass scale . But one problem remains . The distribution problem . How do we get the cure to the animals ? Now , the very important scientists , they think that they have the solution . They want to aerosolize the cure and drop it from planes , but that won 't work . An airborne solution will decay passing through the atmosphere . But I can do it . I can come up with a solution . [ THUDDING NEARBY ] [ MAN GROANING ] - Hey , buddy . - Hey , you all right ? MAN : Oh , I 'm dandy . I 've never been better . Got all this free time on my hands , I thought I 'd do some reading . Couldn 't reach the damn book I wanted . Yeah , well , you know , next time , just come knock on the wall , okay ? I 'll come grab it for you . Yeah , that 's a ... That 's a good idea . You don 't look so good . You sure you 're okay ? You need anything ? Yeah , I 'll take a right leg . I only need it from the knee down . So you heard about the zoo ? Yeah . Rumor has it they were moving the animals into quarantine . - Hippos went nuts . - Yeah , I just talked to Chloe . She told me . It 's true . Wow . That 's crazy . Goldy , you 're taking these , right ? Look , ignore this , get an infection ... If they ever get the elevator fixed , it 'd be a lot easier for me to move around , Jackson . Yeah . I know . I 'll go refill the prescription , okay ? Wait , wait , wait . Not tonight . Wait till tomorrow ? No matter what you think , it 's not safe out there , man . I 'll be fine . Hey , you know animals love me , right ? Wait . At least wear my gear , will you , please ? Yeah . What else has Chloe told you ? They found the leopards . Damn . Well , this calls for a celebration , man . Pick up a sixer when you 're out there too . We still need to find a way to spread the cure to the animals , okay ? You think when we fix this that we 're gonna learn our lesson ? We 're gonna find a better way to share the planet ? - I hope so . - Yeah , it 's kind of like me riding a motorcycle . You know , people used to tell me that I was tempting fate . But ... If it hadn 't been that dog that attacked me it could just as easily have been a drunk driver . - Yeah . - My point is we never really consider that the worst-case scenario could actually happen , do we ? No . That 's the difference between us and the animals . What 's that , huh ? - That we 're arrogant ? - No . We 're stupid . Be careful out there , bud . JACKSON : So how do we distribute the cure ? The food web , right ? That seems to be the best way to spread the cure . We inoculate the prey and let the food web do the rest . [ ANIMALS HOWLING ] So ... Only problem that I can think of would be that the animals , they seem to have stopped feeding on each other . They seem to just be feeding on us . [ MEOWING AND PURRING ] - Victor Holman ? HOLMAN : That 's right . I 'm your ride . Quiet . No more traffic . It 's almost beautiful , isn 't it ? Almost . Until one considers what lurks everywhere . Are you always this cheerful ? Have you lost anybody since this all began ? Yes . Friends or family ? Friends that became family . I 'm sorry . - They were killed ? - One was . And the others ? I chose not to see them . Take a right on Cardozo . But the hospital 's the other way . We 're making a stop before the hospital . [ SNARLING ] [ HISSES ] [ BARKING ] [ SCREAMING ] Hello ? Anyone home ? [ BARKING ] MAN [ ON VIDEO ] : For years , scientists in labs around the world have been collecting DNA samples . And now , those efforts will be put to good use . Every species on Earth , from domestic dogs and cats , to alligators and zebras , will be recreated from this healthy , unaffected DNA and replaced in their natural habitats . From marshlands and savannahs to forests . They 're in the air . They should have the leopards - in about ten hours . MAN : kingdom will be repopulated . No one is suggesting the days ahead will be easy . But thanks to Project Noah , in six to ten years , the world 's animal population will be thriving once again . Vibrant and healthy . Reiden Global . Our most precious resource is you . Noah . Clever . Have we run that by religious leaders ? - Yes . - We showed this to test audiences . We get a 70 percent approval when we use regeneration , as opposed to cleanse . Cleanse upsets people . Everything about this is upsetting . Fortunately , it 's never gonna happen . MAN 1 : One-hundred-twelve countries . - What ? The leopard isn 't going to work . We still don 't know how to distribute the cure . - What about airborne ? - No . We got the test results from the trial . It 's a fail . The cure won 't survive the atmosphere . So , what are we gonna do ? - This . - This ? - Yes . - Killing the animals , play God and repopulate the planet ? - This is ridiculous . - It 's unthinkable , I know . MAN 2 : What 's our lead time ? Do you have a better idea ? MAN 3 : We 're thinking six weeks . HOLMAN : Take the next right . ABRAHAM : Where are we going ? Today is the first day of my chemotherapy . Yes , I know . I 'm sorry to hear . I thought that was why we were going to the hospital . They say the chemotherapy will greatly diminish my sense of taste , which is why we 're making our first stop . And why is that ? - Are you sure you don 't want any ? - I 'm fine . How long has this place been here ? Since a little after everyone decided eating meat was too dangerous . Who wants to eat meat from a homicidal cow ? So these friends that you mentioned earlier . Yes ? Why do you choose not to see them ? Because they are a reminder . Reminders of what ? Of our failures . - Your failure ? - Yes . We could 've stopped all this from happening . There 's a story there . There is . But I prefer not to tell it . [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] What is the matter with you , Dalton ? Why is there no Soundgarden ? You do know you ask me that every single night at exactly the same time . I 'm nothing if not punctual . MAN : Three shots of your best tequila . Beer backs . We are celebrating . Money to be made in the wake of global chaos . Whoa . What the hell is that thing doing in here ? That is my dog . His name is Bomba . MAN : And why isn 't he in quarantine with the rest of them ? Hey , pal , you don 't like it , you are welcome to drink elsewhere . - Maybe we 'll take care of Bomba now . DALTON : Hey , hey , hey . What are you doing ? That 's not necessary . - Who are you ? - Me ? Uh , nobody . I 'm just this establishment 's most loyal customer . There is a very faint impression of my ass on that barstool . What do you want ? I would just like to submit to you that , although I agree that mangy hound is a bit of an eyesore ... Doesn 't smell very good either . But he 's got as much right to be in here as you do . Whoa , what ? Yeah , I 've only known Dalton , the bartender here , for a few months , but I 'm willing to bet that he didn 't really appreciate that dog until all hell broke loose . - How about you just take a step back ? - I think that that 's what most of do . We just kind of take for granted those that we have by our sides until all hell breaks loose , and then ... they 're gone . You don 't get a chance to say what ... - What are you talking about , man ? - I 'm talking about love . MAN : Jeez . - Just talking about love . And how , sometimes , it only comes around once . And when it does , you gotta grab it . - Yeah ? - You got to grab it and hold onto it because , uh , you never know . You never know . It can be gone . Just like that . [ ALL GRUNTING ] Surely , that is not the best you can do . Hey . Stop it . I haven 't been beat up by idiot businessmen since Wednesday . MAN : Come on , let 's get out of here . Thanks . There needs to be a special on these . We 've been selling them like hotcakes . Never seen anything like it , especially this time of year . Gazillions of mosquitoes . They feed on the decay . The mosquitoes feed on the decay . That 's why there 's so many of them . I wish they 'd feed on something else besides me . I 've never gotten this many bug bites in my life . What ? Mosquitoes . JACKSON : Hey . - Hey . Your face . - What happened to you ? - No , it 's okay . Don 't worry . Listen . I figured it out . I know how to distribute the cure . Mosquitoes . - Mosquitoes ? - Mosquitoes , all right ? We inject a certain population of mosquitoes with the cure , we let them spread it to the other animals . Mosquitoes feed on every type of living species there is . I mean , birds , mammals , reptiles , amphibians . Meaning when they bite , they 'll be passing it along . Not only that , but they lay their eggs in water , so it 'll be spread to all sorts of water sources . Feeding holes , remote places we could never even think of getting to . - This could work . - It will work . Amelia , Jackson has ... Athens just declared a state of emergency . Seagulls took out a dozen relay stations . Jackson found a way to deliver the cure . We inject mosquitoes and introduce them into the animal population , all right ? I 've looked at this from every angle . There is no possible downside . I 'm afraid it doesn 't matter . We just got a call from Zambia . The leopard they retrieved , apparently it migrated onto land serviced by Reiden . So it 's been contaminated . It 's no longer viable for the cure . - That 's right . - So that 's it . It 's over . We 're out of options . [ SINGING IN SPANISH ] HOLMAN : I 'm all alone here in Washington . An ugly divorce left my family living out West . I assumed , given the way things are , there 's no way my family could come to me . Not that they would if they could . But the other day , my son called and said : " Dad , we 're figuring it out . We 're getting an old camper van , and we 're driving to be with you . All of us . " RTC comes when you least expect it . RTC ? Reasons to continue . MAN : Come on . ALL [ SINGING ] : And I say , hey , hey , hey Hey , hey , hey I said , hey , what 's going on ? MAN [ IN NORMAL VOICE ] : Come on . - You see ? Reasons to continue . ALL [ SINGING ] : Hey , hey , hey I said , hey , what 's going on ? [ BANGING ON DOOR ] Hello , Abe . Hey . Come on in . What are you doing ? It 's over . They found the remaining leopards . They 've been contaminated . We 're done here . I 'm sorry . They 're talking about this cull . - Have you heard about it ? - Of course . The goons where I work , they 're all eager to join up . It 's insanity . But I suppose why shouldn 't man contribute to their own demise , right ? They 've been doing it since the dawn of time . Oh , just ... I know , don 't say it , don 't say it , I know . I sound exactly like my father . Actually , you said it with more conviction . Can I get you something ? A beer ? I am fine . All right , well , let me know if you change your mind . I had to duke it out with a bunch of baboons for that six-pack . No , thanks . How 's Chloe ? Yeah . She 's getting by . - You know , she 's doing what she can . - And Mitch ? I haven 't talked to him in a couple weeks . I suspect he was in love with her . You know there are these underground restaurants where people can go to eat meat ? I heard about that . There 's also apparently secret societies for cat lovers . Even before all this began , people who love cats should have kept themselves hidden . Where you been , Abe ? You know . Trying to sort things out , I suppose . - And what 'd you learn ? - Not much of anything , really . Except ... These are not the days to retreat from those you care about . In fact , these are the days to do the very opposite . You know , no matter what has happened up until now , we must continue . I mean , things will get worse , yes . There will be failures , yes . There will be suffering . But we must continue . The leopards are gone . So we find whatever is the next leopard , the next solution . Jamie should not have lost her life for nothing . I don 't know what else there is to do . Well , you will figure it out . You 're Jackson Oz . Coming up with solutions is in your blood . But earlier tonight , I witnessed a dying man eating a steak and singing a song , and I understood once again just what it is we are fighting for . You know , I will take you up on that baboon beer . A phone . Thank you . Thank you so much . Thank you , thank you . Wait , there was a ... There was a cub in there . In the box , a cub , there was a cub . There was a little ... He was a small leopard . A small ... Do you know where he is ? Is he okay ? Posivak ? Posivak ? Posivak . Oh , my God . Posivak . Posivak . Well , Bomba , it looks like it 's just me and you again . DALTON : Closing time , man . Yeah , I know . You 'll be able to get home all right ? Oh , yeah . What can the animals do to me that the humans haven 't done already ? [ PHONE RINGING ] Mitch Morgan , totally awesome scientist . Mitch . Mitch , can you hear me ? JAMIE : It 's me . It 's Jamie . No , it isn 't . Jamie 's dead . Who ... ? Who is this ? MITCH : You don 't even sound like her . Okay , are you gonna stop being an ass for a second and listen to me ? JAMIE : It is me . I am alive , and ... And I 'm really glad you are too . MITCH : It really is you . It 's really good to hear your voice . MITCH : It 's really good to hear yours too . I still have it . I have the leopard . I have the cure . Okay . You still have it . Hey , kids . - What happened to you ? - Cut myself snarking . - What 's your excuse ? - Baboons . Of course . Jamie 's alive . Can you believe that ? Unbelievable . Hey , here he is . Hey . Hello , professor . Hey , Chloe . CHLOE : Hi . All right , so , what 's the plan ? We drive to Delaware . There is a boat that will take us to Jamie . - A boat ? - Yeah . It 'll take 18 hours or so , but , you know , air travel . Yeah , I 'm okay not getting on a plane for a while . Hey . What is that ? You all right ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , it 's nothing . It 's a dog bite . It 's fine . MITCH : That needs to be cleaned up . - Doesn 't look too good . - Yeah . Hold on . What the hell ? This doesn 't look so good , either . [ ROARS ] Any ideas ?

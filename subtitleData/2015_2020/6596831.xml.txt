 Previously on Hunters ... Abby Carroll , reported missing less than 24 hours after her picture was sent to the Mexican cell . She 's also married to an FBI agent . Coupled with her spectrum disorder , I 'm afraid self-harming is not something we 're equipped for . Well , you can 't go back to that school ; it 's not safe . 'Cause I 'm commander of the exo-terrorism unit . You think terrorists kidnapped my wife ? Welcome to the ETU . The terrorists we 're chasing aren 't human . We don 't know where they come from . What we do know is that Hunters don 't come in peace . McCarthy 's here . Headed to security . Tell me where my wife is . Tell me ! We are many . We are everywhere . - We 're inside . - And we are angry . - Inside what ? - The ETU . The brutal terrorist group has been highly successful in recruiting young people from all over the world to join its extremist cause . According to the CIA , some 3,000 westerners have traveled to Iraq and Syria and declared loyalty , including more than 200 Americans . And in other news ... Am I a dog , a duck , or a cat ? Quack , quack . You 're a duck . Quack , quack . There you go . Thank you . Lovely day , isn 't it ? It sure is . Can I help you find anything ? Yeah . Whoever this belongs to . Found it on a bench . Some poor little bugger isn 't getting his birthday present . Oh , thank you for bringing it in . My pleasure . Yeah . Carroll , again . Any news on Abby ? Nothing yet . When was the last time you got some sleep ? MISSING ABBY CARROLL Three months ago , you said your hair dryer was too loud . The salesperson assured me this one was the most quiet . 13 days ago , you complained your ear buds didn 't fit with your hearing aids . These are wireless . And this toothbrush is 75 % more efficient than your regular one , and it 's sonic . I don 't know what that means exactly , but it sounds cool . Happy birthday . I love you . Hunters 1x02 - Messages The hurricane . Ride it and weep . Yeah , Briggs wasn 't kidding . That 's some crazy-ass shit . Here . You try it . Let me show you how it 's done . What , the Marines didn 't teach you how to pull the trigger ? What was that ? You 're one of them . I thought you knew . Only just found out , did you ? Are you one , too ? No . Just her . An explosion at a DC mall has killed seven people . This was an attack on domestic soil with civilian casualties . Their audio message said blood would be spilled , and it has been . Seven people died at the mall . A thermal or chemical explosion would have killed a lot more . You 're thinking this was a warning ? - Or a message . - They already sent a message . Literally . Or it 's like Shahzad in Times Square . The bomb was supposed to be worse , but the asshole who built it was royally incompetent . Whatever the motive , we have a person of interest . Surveillance pics . Finnerman is running interference with the feds as we speak . You missed the debriefing . You mean the one where you tell me you got one of them on the payroll ? My wife was kidnapped by one of those things and you just expect me to work alongside one ? Regan earned our trust long ago . You 're still earning yours . Slavich 's last words to me were about hunters being inside the ETU . Do you really need me to connect the dots ? Slavich was just trying to mess with your head . Well , it won 't work with that thing . Look , I realize how overwhelming this must be . A new species , hostile . I reacted the exact same way when I found out . I was confused , angry , afraid . Your wife is still in the picture . You don 't know a damn thing about what I 'm going through . Maybe not . But I do have this . Lionel McCarthy . The bastard who took Abby . The DJ , calls himself Lionel of the Simatic Society . He 's also the main suspect in this morning 's bombing . We find out where he is , we find your wife . You gotta see this . Viewer discretion is advised . It 's ... pretty twisted . Forgive me . Chicken shit coward . Keep watching . What the hell ? Randall Slavich . You got six hours to bring me his body , or more bombs , more dead , more fun ? And one of you creatures will be hanging here next . Maybe you , Flynn Carroll ? Or maybe Abby Carroll ? You know what I 'm saying . I 'll be in touch . Quack , quack . Play it again . Keep to the script . Slavich 's wife was told her husband was suspected of smuggling drugs at the airport . This is bullshit . I mean , we should be hunting McCarthy , not interviewing widows . Slavich 's wife could be a hunter . Well , is there a test to prove it ? Like a scanner or a DNA sampler . Not yet . Jules is working on one . But I can tell . What , like a special handshake ? There 's something you want to say ? Not to you . Fine , then . I 'll say it for you . I don 't know what planet I come from , or how I was born . I don 't have an antenna , except on my car . I get a weird skin thing every few months . I cried when I saw " E.T. , " and no ... my lady parts do not feel different than a human 's , but you knew that already . That 's a damn lie . My wife is not one of you . We were married six years . Believe me , I 'd know . McCarthy 's sick video offered us a deal . Slavich 's body in exchange for no more bombings . I don 't negotiate with terrorists . In 2010 , we freed Qais al-Khazali in exchange for Peter Moore . We ransomed Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines in 2001 . Those were live hostages . And the White House had the press breathing down their necks like a pack of hungry wolves . - Ruth ... - I don 't pander and I don 't negotiate with terrorists , especially non-human ones . We 've collected 600 corpses over the last four years . This is the first time they 've wanted the body back . Don 't you want to know why ? So we hand over Slavich 's body in return for what ? A chat ? I got my Twitter feed for that . Why did McCarthy single out the new agent , Flynn Carroll ? His wife 's abduction is the obvious connection . And then ... he has the scar . Does he know what it means ? He claims not to . Do you trust him ? I don 't know . That 's weird . There was a cage like that in McCarthy 's farmhouse . They like rabbits . What , like for pets ? To hunt . They can 't help themselves . Don 't worry . I 'm a vegetarian . Mrs. Slavich ? Homeland security . We 'd like to talk to you about your husband . I don 't know who you think my husband was , but he wasn 't a drug smuggler . He was a good man . And you people killed him . Your husband was tasered after assaulting a security officer . The coroner said he died of an undiagnosed heart condition . Then why don 't I get to see the body ? Aren 't I supposed to identify him or something ? Did you ... ever notice any type of ... unusual behavior ? Randall was a kind and gentle man . I mean , he kept rabbits for God 's sake , and now you people are here telling me that you killed him because he was a drug smuggler . I know my husband , and he was not whatever you people think he was . There is one last thing we need to ask about . A piece of evidence connected to your husband 's case . Have you heard this song before ? A song ? Are you joking ? I hate new wave . No . Hey . Excuse me . Hey . Hey ! What is it ? What 's wrong ? Get back in the house . Get back in the house , please . Is she one of them ? No . You 're sure ? The second I met her . INCOMING CALL PRIVATE NUMBER - Carroll . - Bring me Slavich 's body , but come alone . One word about our little arrangement to ETU , and you will never see Abby again . Slavich 's body . You 're not getting it . Couldn 't care less . I got what I really wanted . I don 't see it . I mean , you were hyped , man . Nope . Not getting it . What 's so special about you ? What do you want ? What , do you mean me personally or us ... hunters ? Enough game-playing . How does this work ? I offer you stuff in exchange for Abby ? 'Cause I 'll do it . Grade school clever . You keep me talking till the tin soldiers come rushing in with their firecrackers and their two-bit explosions . Martian go boom , that 's what you 're hoping for , ain 't it , you big , strong Marine ? - Lost contact . - Oh , look , what a manly man beast you are . Defying my instructions . You are one hot-headed police officer Afghan vet dev in training . How do you know about me ? I mean , you said so yourself ... The real question is , what do you know about me ? Nothing . Except you 're an arrogant prick , lapdog . We 've been made . Take your team through the back entrance . Sweep for explosives before you move in . Roger that . Regan , can you hear anything ? He 's in there alone . I 'm going in . Regan . Regan ! Watch your mouth , boy ! Slavich spoke to you before he killed himself . What 'd he tell you ? I don 't know . He had someone on the inside . A mole . Don 't give me that B-movie Keyser SÃ¶ze crap ! What 'd he tell you ? What do you know about us ? Until a week ago , I didn 't even know you existed . Okay ? I didn 't even know you fucking freaks existed ! He took Abby . He took ... my wife . My family . Kids are resilient . Abby 'll be fine . Maybe . You go near her , I will destroy you . I will destroy every last one of you ! Wherever the hell you are from . Dumb , insignificant , and nauseatingly sincere . Thank you so much for telling me the truth . You want to see Abby now ? Come on . She 's all yours , tiger . Regan ! Carroll ! Clear ! Take the top floor ! Finish the sweep . It 's not Abby . Thanks , Doc . Hey ! Hey . Any word on McCarthy ? Nothing yet . He 's disappeared again . Just like at the airport ? Funny how Agent Regan keeps losing him . Why would I let McCarthy escape ? I don 't know . Maybe you two are related . Or maybe you 're the mole Slavich was talking about . You 're just here for yourself . And you 're calling me the traitor ? I could crush you . Come on , people . Regan , come away now . It 's not Regan 's fault we lost McCarthy . You better hope so . We need to talk . Yeah . I understand it 's difficult with Carroll under the circumstances . Give him time , I mean , I wouldn 't trust you either if I were him . It 's not about Carroll . Or Paige . The song . The one Slavich and McCarthy used to communicate . What about it ? When we played it for Slavich 's wife , I saw something in my mind , not like I see with my eyes . Images . More like outlines . I felt it in the Coahela factory , and other times in the past . You haven 't mentioned this before . I didn 't know what it was . And it happened again today when I heard the clicks . The code they used to encrypt their messages . I don 't think it 's code . I think the clicks are the messages . It could be their language . And I 'm seeing it inside my head . Everything at this stupid boarding school has gravy on it . I told them I don 't like gravy and they said they would stop putting gravy on my food , but of course , it still has gravy on it . Why do you look so nervous ? I 'm not . I 'm making sure everything 's safe . You know , the only thing dangerous in here is me . Em ... Can you ... recognize this man ? I thought you came to see me . Em , please . Prosopagnosia is one of my conditions . I 'm face blind . A lot of Aspies have it . Yeah . I ... I knew that . I mean , it 's not 100 % . I see parts , eyes , hands , and voices , anything with sound helps me . Em , here . - Okay . - What are you doing ? Have you heard this before ? There . It 's starting . What do you see ? Between the clicks , pieces of light . Shapes . Spaces . I see it and I hear it at the same time . You have heard it . Okay . Where ? It ... it was at a music store with Abby . Where ? - A-Audio Attic . - Audio Attic . She was buying sheet music . - Yeah . - Oh , no ... there were ... something else . And there was ... There was ... It was coming out of headphones . I remember , it was coming out of headphones around some guy 's neck . It was really loud . I can 't explain it , the ... the color is from the shape of the sounds . It 's 3D , but it isn 't . Like bats or dolphins . Some kind of echolocation . - Audio Attic . - Yeah , hi , are you open ? No , we 're still closed . The store 's been shut down ever since the explosion . An explosion . When ? Two weeks ago . Everything in the store was destroyed . Thanks . Jackson . Carroll ? The bombing in D.C. wasn 't random . McCarthy 's cleaning house . And I know how to find them . The attack in D.C. was a * * * music store . Bomb was placed * * * just outside the front door . Music store . Why ? Well , the owners recognized McCarthy and Slavich as customers . So did the manager of Audio Attic . Plus , a third music store nearby was destroyed in a fire . McCarthy 's covering his tracks . Yeah , hunters were setting up meetings via the Spotify channel . Using music stores as cover ? And to stalk victims like Abby . It 's where McCarthy first saw her . She was buying sheet music . Stores that sell vinyl records ? That 's anachronistic . Briggs is right . There aren 't many left . Using McCarthy 's Brunswick farmhouse as the epicenter , I count 40 within a 300-mile perimeter . If there is to be another attack and we get there before McCarthy , we 're looking at a possible goldmine of intel . Security footage , receipts , forensic evidence . 40 stores . That 's the proverbial needle . There 's no way of telling which one 's next . It 's that one . Blue Peak Music . That 's McCarthy 's next target . How do you know that ? Because I heard it . Yeah . Blue Peak Music . Clever creatures . Thanks for the leg up . Yeah , yeah , yeah , time sensitive , I get it . I hope you left some hot water for me , sweetheart . Or I might have to punish you again . That was Jackson . He 's en route with our backup . Briggs and I will go in the back , search the place , make sure McCarthy isn 't in there . You do that . I 'll take the front . No sign of McCarthy . You got anything ? Mrs. Slavich ? - You were in Afghanistan . - Carroll , you there ? You know what this means ? I press number five , the bomb I just planted inside receives a paging signal . The signal initiates a firing circuit and then everyone dies . I don 't want to hurt anybody , but I will . Okay , okay . Why are you doing this ? You 're not one of them . He tried to get the body back . I didn 't want Randall cut up . Dissected like a pig , but you people wouldn 't listen to him . McCarthy ? He gave Randall his orders . Slavich 's wife . We need to evacuate . Now . Randall picked me , of all the humans on Earth , to help him with his cause , to do what 's good , and right . Follow Brother with him . Briggs , let me know when you 're safe . How did you figure out your husband wasn 't human ? He told me . If he hadn 't , I never would have known . They even smell just like us . Sweat on his clothes . Our sheets . He wanted me to know who he really was . The others , the ones you came here to track down , you 'll never find them ... Find us . Where are the other hunters ? Where ? How many are there ? We 're in your houses . Your churches . Where you work and eat and sleep and you don 't even know it . All clear . Out the back , now . We 're everywhere . And you can 't stop us . A police search of the Slavich home found a political manifesto proclaiming the suspect 's allegiance to a domestic terrorist group . Jessie Slavich claimed responsibility of the bombing of three other music stores before dying of injuries sustained in today 's explosion . Manifesto . Nice touch . I love my work . Shame we couldn 't capture her alive . Well , she got the bomb off before Agent Regan could stop her . Thankfully , she only took herself out and not any of us . Did we recover anything at the store ? The sonic blast blew everything to bits . Any evidence that was inside was destroyed . So no more leads on McCarthy ? We got some forensics off the body in the warehouse . Turns out there was heroin in the victim 's system , a dirty syringe nearby . Look into it . - I 'm onto it . - That is all . Regan . Yeah ? You know , the ... patch on your arm ? The skin thing ? Relax . It 's not contagious . Jessie Slavich said she never would have known what her husband was if he hadn 't told her . Is there any way to ... you know ... cover it ? With enough lotion if you work at it . It 's basically dry skin . You want to see it ? Yeah . McCarthy scratched some pieces off . It 's a bit roughed up . Abby never had that . Are you sure ? Yeah , I 'm sure . Seen enough ? I 've got a spinach lasagna ... Netflix queue full of " Downton Abbey " waiting for me at home . Sounds good . Hey . Thanks . I 'm sorry . You don 't owe me an apology . She was a human collaborator . She might have led us to other hunters . Jessie Slavich bombed a civilian target and was within striking distance of a fellow agent . You saved Agent Carroll 's life . I screwed up with Paige . I screwed up with the music store . This hunter shit that 's inside me , I can 't control it . I mean , look at me . I tore that woman to shreds , like an animal . And I liked it . I need the treatment . You know that 's not an option anymore . But it 's worse when I have this . Everything feels raw like I 'm starving . I just need something to take the edge off of the urges , please . Alison , the treatment weakens you . I need you strong . But I 'm not . But you are , and you will be . The unit needs you . But you 'll just have to manage your demons the same way as the rest of us . HAND BODY LOTION There you are . Lurking like trolls in a Reddit chatroom . You leather-faced fudder-muckers . Oh , but we are , even in these putrid pink wrappers , we 're still losing our shells . Agent Regan is shedding like a freakin ' cobra . All right , who 's up ? Just a scrape from her arm . Open wide . Tell Mosher I hope he chokes on it .

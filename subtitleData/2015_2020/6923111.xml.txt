 My name is H.G. Wells . My friend John is Jack the Ripper . He 's escaped from 1893 in my time machine , and I 'm the only one who can catch him . I want the key and the time machine now . Well , I can 't oblige , John . What if I told you that George is really H.G. Wells ? I would say you 've lost your damn mind . H.G. Wells ... he 's in New York . He came in his time machine . You can stop this all from happening . I 'm Brooke . I 'm a neuropathologist . I 'd be honored if you 'd join me for a drink . You and I were always supposed to meet . I am completely blinded by you , Miss Walker . No ! Who 's the guy ? I don 't know , but I 've seen this man before . - He was following me . - Who are you ? I 'm someone who 's waited a long time to meet you . I brought you something to help clear your head . Just apple juice . It 's organic , fresh pressed . Your system must be in shock after all the preservatives they put in food these days . Well , that made a mess . You 'll regret this . Regret drugging you ? After you tried to stab me with a kitchen knife ? Who are you ? I 'm someone who knows you 're Jack the Ripper . And you escaped to 2017 in H.G. Wells ' time machine . I also know that Mr. Wells is being aided by a distant relative ... Vanessa Anders . But you 're all alone . Something tells me you could use a friend . You have to trust me . Trust you ? I 'll come back when you 're feeling more yourself . Hey there , big boy . Click on it now . Show me how big you are . Check out my live cam . - Good morning . - Y-yes it is ... Good morning ... What are you doing ? Attempting to master the Internet and failing miserably . I really enjoyed last night . - We were almost killed . - Right . No , the part after that . As did I. It wasn 't too forward , was it ? Because I forget you 're from 1893 , and things were more formal back then . And I didn 't want to come across as ... I don 't know how you used to call it ... a harlot . Which you are not , I-I assure you . Not to sound old-fashioned , but I do struggle with the ease with which men and women give themselves to each other . Sexual mores of today are quite baffling as it 's all ... it 's all so very ... - Casual ? - No . It 's routine . Lacking in romance . See , in my day , passion and desire ... they were ... they were the true result of yearning for a woman . The longing that fills you head and clouds every thought as you patiently await for her to walk through the door and say " Good morning . " - Good morning , Jane . - Good morning . Good morning . - Morning . - Morning . We have information about the man who attacked you . His name was Chad Holland . He had a place in the Bronx , lived alone , never married , worked odd jobs , history of trouble , but mostly petty crime . But nothing to explain why he was trying to kill me ? How he knows about me and John ? I take it John still hasn 't called ? No . And it 's way past his deadline . I 've known John for many years . If he hasn 't reached out , then something 's happened . Maybe he had a run-in with Chad Holland . Is there any way to access Chad Holland 's residence ? We can try . I 'll drive you . Great . I have some business to deal with . You 'll let me know if you find out anything . Honey . Have you been waiting long ? No , I just got here . Hi . So where 's Wells ? I was hoping to get a chance to talk to him this morning . He stepped out for a bit . He 'll be back . My head is still spinning . I can 't believe he 's the real H.G. Wells . How long does he plan on staying ? I 'm not sure . It all depends on finding John Stevenson . It 's crazy . It 's right out of some science fiction story . Written by H.G. Wells maybe . A real working time machine . Do you know how many people would kill for something like that ? Are you sure it 's secure here ? I trust my team , and I 've installed a security system - that requires key-card access . - Good . So , what about the war veteran charity tonight ? - Should we cancel ? - No . It 's just the board members , and they 're all friends of mine . And they 're here to meet you . Wait , you set this up for me ? You are running for Senate . And a cocktail party full potential donors never hurt a campaign . Babe , you didn 't have to do that . I insist . I 've been so distracted by H.G. And tonight , you 're my priority . Come here . Thank you so much for you trouble . We promise to be quick . You 're just yummy . How did you know Chad ? We were friends . His family asked us to come . I didn 't know he had any family . Hell , I didn 't know he had any friends . Guy gave me the creeps . You 're too kind . I 'm a sucker for a Brit . My father was a Brit . He came over after World War II . There was more than one ? Thank you ... so much . We really appreciate this . Chad was a little obsessed . He was following both of us . How did he know that we would be here ? This would be easier if we knew what we were looking for . Is that the same emblem ? It 's the one I put in my letter to Vanessa . What is that ? It appears to be coordinates . Hi there . Don 't suppose I could have my clothes ? Feeling better ? And will you behave yourself ? It 's not my wish to keep you locked up in here , John . I did it out of necessity . I want to us to learn to trust each other . Trust works both ways , Brooke . May I ? It 's chilly in here . So , where are we ? My basement lab , where I work . So you were telling the truth about being a doctor . Biotechnology research . Neurology , genetics , biochemistry . My father was a scientist . He inspired me to continue his research . Fascinating . Really ? I was afraid the Ripper would find me boring . Boring ? A little romp in the bedroom , syringe to the neck , awaken naked and tied up in a laboratory ... Boring is the very least of what you are , my darling . So , what is all of this ? Gene therapy . I 'm working on ways to improve human neurological function . You 're looking at your own DNA , which is your genetic makeup . Deoxyribonucleic acid . They 'd just begun to study it in my day . So you want to analyze my brain ? You might not like what you find . I doubt that , John Leslie Stevenson . Born 1863 in London to Elizabeth Stevenson , a street prostitute . No surprise there . No father , but you fought your way to Oxford to the top of your class . Esteemed surgeon by day , killer by night . How do you know so much about me ? I know things about you that you don 't even know about yourself . Like the fact that you have a son . I can assure you I do not have a son . Henry Ayers ... born to Pauline Ayers , a nurse you met in 1891 in Paris . Do you remember her ? Impossible . I want to conduct some tests . Nothing too invasive . A controlled environment to study your psychopathy . What do I get ? The time machine , of course . Do you know where it is ? It 's under lock and key , courtesy of Vanessa Anders . It 's also where your little friend , H.G. Wells , has been staying since he 's been in New York . I can get it for you . Yes , if I submit to being your lab rat . I want you to start thinking of me ... as a friend . Just a friend ? With a little extra . You know , there 's a crazy killer on every corner today , Brooke . Why me ? Because there 's only one Jack the Ripper . Were you able to find out anything about the coordinates from Chad 's apartment ? Yes and no . The longitude and latitude takes us here to a residential area of Glen Cove , Long Island . These next numbers appear to be a date ... September 15 , 1980 . What about these numbers ? It 's the time ... 1 : 42 p.m. So , Chad was trying to get to the time machine to go to Long Island on a specific date and time . - Why ? - He said he had to stop something . In 1980 ? Well , perhaps an event occurred in the area , something with significance . From what I can find , the day was rather uneventful . I 've searched the archives of the local paper . The biggest news was a bake sale at the county courthouse . We 're missing something . We know I 'm important to Chad Holland ... as is John for that matter . We still haven 't heard from him . There 's a mystery afoot that we 're not aware of . I have to go . It 's all we have . - You 're going to 1980 ? - Yes , to Glen Cove , is it ? How 's my wardrobe ? Wait . I 'm coming with you . It isn 't safe . I have no idea what 's in store . I 'm a historian . I know the ' 80s . You don 't . Let me help you . I want to come . - You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm excited . This is not fear . It 's a little fear with excitement . But I 'm ready . Let 's do this . So ... this is 1980 . Why would the coordinates bring us to the middle of nowhere ? Do you hear that ? It 's coming from over there . Here we are . Looks like a party . It 's an impressive house . It 's a yuppie barbecue . - Is this your ball ? - Yes . - Here we are . - Thank you . You talk funny . I 'm from England . Vanessa , come inside . Vanessa Maria Anders , now ! - Was that ... - Vanessa . Yes . We 're at her parents ' house . What does Chad have to do with Vanessa 's family ? Why would he want to come here ? Well , the man wanted me dead , and Vanessa and her parents are my descendants . Maybe they were his targets , too . In 1980 ? We 'll have a look around , - see what we find . - Wait . Let 's make you a yuppie . A yuppie ? What 's a yuppie ? A young urban professional with an affluent lifestyle they like to talk about endlessly . - Sounds obnoxious . - Well , welcome to the ' 80s . Reagan was president . Greed was good . Fashion was awful . It was a time of Spandex , " Dynasty . " I want my MTV . - You want your what ? - It 's a party . Just say things like " Madonna " and " Wall Street , " and you 'll fit right in . Right , got it . Well , hello there , you two . I don 't believe I 've seen you at one of the Anders ' shindigs before . Here , I thought I knew all of Courtney and David 's friends . We just moved to the neighborhood . I 'm Angelina , and this is my husband , Brad . I 'm Bethanny . My hubby 's around here somewhere ... probably at the bar not getting me a refill . You said you were new to the area ? Yes , we just bought a place down the road . On Wall Street . Well , it 's a shame you didn 't wait a little longer to buy . All of this could 've been yours . The Anders ' house is for sale ? Well , unofficially . I hear David 's company is not doing well . That 's terrible . May I refresh that for you ? Such a gentleman . Amaretto sour . I 'll come with you , honey . I was really hoping to get to know the guy . - When will they be back ? - That 's up to them . They 're controlling the machine manually . Now , do they come back at the same time as when they left ? - How 's that work ? - They travel in real time , so as to not tear the fabric of the timeline . Is that like time-travel science or ... ? Martin , where did they go ? Glen Cove , Long Island , 1980 . Show me . I want to see the exact location of Chad 's coordinates . You got it . That 's the backyard of my childhood home . Whoa . Let me know the moment they get back . Don 't look now , but I think you 're about to meet another one of your family members . Hello . How old are you ? I 'm 3 . You 're 3 ? Wow . She likes you . I 'm sorry , I don 't believe we 've met . I 'm Courtney Anders . You have such a lovely home . Thank you . Are you friends with my husband ? - As a matter of fact ... - We are friends with Bethanny . She told us so much about you two . Really . What did that gossip have to say ? David , hon , you have a guest . If you 'll excuse me . Welcome to our home . It was very nice meeting you . Lovely to meet you , as well . Bye . We mustn 't interact so blatantly . Remember , we cannot influence , obstruct , or do anything that can alter the timeline . We must observe only . You can 't just barge in ... So why don 't we observe that ? Wait here . I 'll be right back . Who 's that man ? Jane , that satchel . It was in Chad 's apartment . Radical gene therapy fails when the brain rejects the new DNA . It doesn 't want to change , but ... my father discovered a better method , and I 've perfected it . And once this new DNA is inside the brain , you can manipulate the chemistry in the brain to control how people think ? You 're catching on . Do you want to study me or change me ? Don 't you want to change ? Not in the least . Think about it . Your impulse to kill , that blinding rage that consumes you . Don 't you want to control it just ... just a teensy bit ? Your son , Henry Ayers ... he was a doctor like you before he died in Paris in 1918 . I wonder if he inherited your killer instincts . And aren 't you curious ? If I cared at all , I would have paid better attention to the women I slept with . Why am I so important to you , Brooke ? What are you not telling me ? I have the answers to all your questions . But you need to be patient . Not a very patient man , Brooke . You of all people should know that . No , stop . What the hell was that ? That 's the exact same satchel we found in Chad 's apartment . And why was he arguing with Vanessa 's father ? We need to find out who he is . I know just the person . Bethanny ! My God . It 's my two new best friends . Did you forget my amaretto sour ? I 'm afraid so . Bethanny , who is that guy over there ? Him ? He 's married . And so am I. To me . I 'm just having a little fun . What else can you tell us about that guy ? His name is Robert . 30s , grew up here , married five years . They travel a lot . Beautiful wife , but she 's cheating on him . Can 't really blame her , though . He 's a bit odd . No divorce yet , but I give them another ... two months max . My God . Imagine the possibilities if you use your memory for something significant . And his last name ? Holland . Does he have a child ? Yeah , a little boy . Chad . There 's Jennifer . Look at that horrendous perm . Hey , Jenny ! Hi ! So Chad 's father is connected to the Anders . - But how ? - And why now ? Why is today so important to Chad ? Come with me , this way . Come on . I think he needs another 8 milligrams of Zofran . Please watch him . Some sort of experiment ? Tell me ... does you weapon administer a form of anesthesia ? Don 't worry about it . My word . Sure she 's okay alone with him ? Aaah ! Good God , man ! Stop . Don 't do this , John . - I can help you . - I don 't need your help . If you want to help somebody , help yourself 'cause you , my dear , are as mad as a bag of ferrets . This is a real gun . Well , you 've made it quite clear you need my alive . Goodbye , love . It was stupid for you to come to my house . I have the files for all the drug research . - Do you want them or not ? - Let me see . You have no idea what I went through to get these . So do we have a deal ? Is this everything on Project Utopia ? That 's what you asked for , isn 't it ? Amazing . Can you be implicated ? I 'm not stupid . I covered my tracks . Get these drugs on the marketplace first . He 'll never be able to prove they were stolen . I 'm gonna make so much money . Speaking of money , where 's mine ? I wasn 't expecting you to just show up here today . This is all the cash I had in the house . This isn 't what we talked about . - We had an agreement . - Yes , I know . And I will get you the rest of the money . No , you don 't get this until I get all the money . Don 't be unreasonable . This will bring the money . - You know who I am . - I thought I did . Let me know when you have the money . David ? What are you doing back here ? Go ! Go , go . Get out of here . We should have done something back there . Vanessa 's father killed Chad 's father . You know as well as I do we cannot change history . The consequences would be too great . Do you think Vanessa has any idea what her father did ? I 'm betting she doesn 't . So how were the ' 80s ? - Um ... - Um ... Hair ... lots of hair . Okay . Well , Vanessa wants to see you guys ASAP . Right , thank you , Martin . Need anything else from me tonight ? No , we 're all set . All righty , then . See you tomorrow . What are we gonna tell Vanessa ? Well , the truth . She has a right to know . I don 't think that 's a good idea . Well , regardless , Vanessa and I made an agreement to be truthful to one another . Right , but sometimes the truth can be hurtful . - But perhaps necessary . - Wait . Before we say anything to Vanessa , why don 't we find out a little more on Robert Holland , Project Utopia , and how it connects to Anders ? And there was the second one . Excuse me . Let 's talk . So , I understand you went to my childhood home . Yes , coordinates from Chad Holland 's apartment led us there . Did you see me ? Yes , we ... we met briefly . You don 't remember ? No , I was only 3 . You were an adorable child . Did you see my parents ? David and Courtney . Yes . They were having a garden party . They were very gracious . You know , I can 't believe it . What connection does my family have to Chad Holland ? We don 't know . Unfortunately , it was a dead end . Well , at least you got to see my parents and meet some more of your family . We did overhear your father talk about his work . A Project Utopia ? Utopia ? I don 't know of any Project Utopia . I don 't even know why he would use the word . I found it odd myself . I was hoping you might know . - Does raise an eyebrow . - Yes , it does . You know , I keep all of my father 's research on digital files . I 'll look into it as soon as the party 's over . Of course . You did the right thing . Can I help you ? Yes . Yes , you can actually . I 'm looking for the party . You got to go back outside and check in with security . Okay , thank you . This one 's a keeper . You need to get him more involved . Excuse me , ma 'am . Someone is asking for you . I 'll be right back . Brooke . What a surprise . I didn 't know you were coming . Sorry to barge in without an invitation . Well , you 're always welcome . I wish I saw more of you . Me , too . Is my brother around ? Yes , he 's right over here . Griffin . Your sister 's here . - We 'll talk later . - Okay . Brooke . What the hell are you doing here ? We need to talk . Why are you here ? I 've been trying to reach you . John escaped . What happened ? You were supposed to keep him locked up . Well , now he 's gone , and he knows where the time machine is . - He 's coming here ? - I don 't know . Maybe . That 's not our only problem . Wells traveled back to Glen Cove 1980 . - Did he find out about Utopia ? - I don 't know . When need to secure the time machine ... now . You want to take it now in the middle of a fundraiser . If Wells finds out Robert Holland sold our father 's research to David Anders , it 's all over . We need to move . What is Project Utopia besides an ironic joke on me ? It was worth killing for . That we know . But who did Chad 's father steal it from ? Who invented it ? It must involve me somehow . Chad knew that . So did Chad want the time machine to go back to 1980 to stop his father from being killed ? What else could it be ? " Robert L. Holland , " " survived by wife , Mary , and six-month-old son , Chad , " " died September 16 , 1980 , " " as a result of injuries sustained " " in an accidental fall outside his home . " The Anders covered it up . He made it look like an accident . And Vanessa has no idea about any of this . Explains why her parents were so charitable . Can imagine the guilt was eating them alive . Project Utopia ... so far , I 've found a spiritual retreat in New Mexico , an alt-rock band , and an African charity . In our search for answers , all we 've gotten are more questions . I really have made a mess of my invention . Time travel was meant for research and observation . I wanted to better the world , not destroy it . Whatever is happening , we 'll figure it out . - How do you do that ? - Do what ? Fix me with just a kiss . I know this woman . There 's a document specialist at the museum . She can help find anything . I bet she could help find Project Utopia . Can you contact her ? I have her number on my phone . Let me go get it . Well , hello , Miss Walker . Don 't you look lovely . What are you doing here ? Well , you know me . I hate to miss a party . You want the time machine . You know me so well . But as I 'm sure you 're aware , it 's behind lock and key . So , tell me , Jane . How many people do I have to hurt to get into that room ? None . Because I have the key right here . Marvelous . It 's John ! He 's here ! We have a breach . Somebody help ! Help ! Help ! - Are you okay ? - It 's John . He 's here . - The time machine . - Yes . Thank you . Hey . Everything okay ? Have you seen Griffin ? He was just here . Ms. Anders . A word , please ? Excuse me . I know you . John Stevenson is in the house . I know . Get everybody out . - Seal the exits . - Will do . He 's here for the time machine . Break it down . Griffin . No . Griff , honey ? Griffin , sweetheart . My God . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . It 's just a scratch . My doctor is on the way . What happened ? There was an intruder , and your brother tried to stop him . - Why don 't I take a look at that ? - Yeah . I have to go check in with Doug . - I 'll only be a moment . - Okay . Thank you . So he got away . And the time machine ? Wells was able to bring it back . Remotely ? Yes , he 's got it wired up to computers now . But it was empty . John got away . Where did he go ? March 30 , 1918 ... does that date mean anything to you ? No , what are the coordinates ? Latitude 48.856 north . Longitude 2.3522 east . I don 't understand . Why would John go there ?

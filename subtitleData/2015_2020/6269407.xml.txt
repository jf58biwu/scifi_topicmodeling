 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . The child- - part human , part alien- - Was unlike anything the world had ever seen . My other child is a lifelike android . Mom ? He has become the prototype for a new breed Of thinking machines called humanichs . These two extraordinary new life-forms Now hold the key to earth 's future . But where does that leave us ? Over 99 % of all species That have ever existed have gone extinct . What if it 's our time ? Previously on extant ... The hybrids have gone underground . They 're out there multiplying . We 're not here to kill . We 're here to survive . How do you know he told you the truth ? Because i 'm one of them . I 'm becoming a crossbreed of species . Lucy : Do they know you haven 't put The limiters on me yet ? ( woman screams ) How soon can additional humanichs like lucy be ready For combat ? Right away , sir . Lucy : My experiential upload is going Into all of those humanichs ? Lucky them . Molly : The gsc has a virus to kill hybrids . We 're gonna wipe those hybrids out Permanently . They are all Gonna die , me included . ( beeps twice ) ( groans ) it 's time for you and i To have a little chat . How the hell did you get in here ? This gun says i don 't answer questions . Ah . You looking for this ? Oh , yeah , I dismantled your little panic button . Cool feature . Very high-tech . So where are we going ? How about you just drive . ( engine starts ) ( woman speaks chinese ) Translating device : My son was so strong . ( speaks chinese ) So happy . ( speaks chinese ) I thought he was a gift from god . But a full-term baby after just a two-month pregnancy ? You must have known that wasn 't normal . Why didn 't you tell anyone ? ( device translating into chinese ) You 're undocumented . ( device translates into chinese ) Then what happened ? ( device translates into chinese ) ( speaks chinese ) He just grew so fast . ( speaks chinese ) Before i knew it , he was walking . ( speaks chinese ) Talking . One day ... I saw him standing in front Of the sliding door ... Staring out the window At nothing . He said , " mommy ... They 're calling me . " ( speaks chinese ) " i have to go . " ( speaks chinese ) And then he was gone . Who was calling him ? ( device translates into chinese ) ( speaks chinese ) The devil . Sit . Hello , toby . ( exhales ) Do you have any idea The position you just put me in ? Put yourselves in ? Not so great being in the hot seat , is it ? This is an abduction . No , it 's not . It 's a negotiation . You 're really stoked about this , huh ? Yeah . Once they wake up , my family 's going to be even bigger . Your family ? Yeah . Lucy 's my sister , so that makes All these new humanichs my brothers and sisters . Ah ... So what does that make me ? My bhf . Your what ? My best human friend . You never lied to me or reprogrammed me . Or left me . And i never will . You 're my bhf . My best humanich friend . I love you , bud . Lucy ! Lucy : I 've been released From diagnostics . They said you were going online . Can i see ? Yeah , sure . We 're just about to fire this guy up . Man , it 's too bad julie 's in d.C. She 's missing the fruits of her labor . And you 're missing her . We 're not talking about me- - We 're talking about this guy . He doesn 't have a name ? No , not yet . You want to do the honors ? ¶ ¶ Lucas . His name is lucas . All right . Let 's do this thing . Hi , charlie . Lucy . Ethan . Hello , lucas . Shepherd : What exactly Are you proposing here ? Peace . Coexistence . Coexistence with the hybrids Means the end of the human race . Extinction . ( sighs ) : Maybe not . Maybe ... It 's just a new beginning . We haven 't even thought Of the possibilities . ( laughs softly ) What possibilities ? They 're smarter than us . They heal faster . Their dna just might contain A medical magic bullet . They control your thoughts , Make you do whatever they damn well please . Now , we can talk pros and cons all day long , molly , They 're still a threat . They 're not killing women anymore . They 've evolved . Yeah . They 've gone underground , somewhere . And obviously you know where . Toby , Come on , they 're half human , for god 's sakes . There 's women , there 's children . Can you expand your mind for just two seconds ? Damn it , molly ! What 'd you expect me to do ? Huh ? There-there is no universe Where this makes sense to anybody Except you . Bup-bup-bup . Sit back down , General . Nobody said You could get up . Okay . Look , toby , All i 'm asking you to do Is broker ... Some sort of peace conference . You can see for yourselves who they are Before you unleash A virus that will destroy them . That 's got to be better than genocide . Toby ... Please . ( sighs ) You made me lie to congress . What if i told them the truth ? That you knew about this So-called invasion but you kept it hidden . It 'd be your word against mine . I 'd pass that bmi polygraph in two seconds . You ... Would be discredited , Lose your stripes , your honor . ( whispers ) : Everything . How do i get in touch with you ? You have 24 hours to talk to your people . Then we 'll be in touch . Excuse me . Toby , where the hell have you been ? We need to assemble the team . First there is something you need to see . Can you tell me what you told the nurse ? What is happening to you ? ( woman speaking chinese ) Translating device : My hair and fingernails ... They 're growing so fast . I hear strange voices in my head That won 't stop telling me To do shameful things . Do you believe that my son is a demon ? Is he a demon ? ! Tell me ! ( beep ) Who is she ? Mei fong . Illegal . Nate 's with her in the faraday unit now . He 's running a cmp , a whole-exome sequence , And a marrow extract . Good . We need to find out Exactly what happened to her . ( birds chirping ) What are we doing here ? We are picking up stuff for a rainy day . Open the damn door . Female a.I. : Welcome back , mr . Richter . " open the damn door " ? That 's your password ? Easy to remember . Okay , we got to grab night kits , H2o extractors , and solar bundles . You really think we need all this stuff ? Tobias shepherd Is capable of just about anything . And i am prepared for ... Just about anything . He 's not evil , jd . He 's ... He 's just complicated . Complicated ? That 's the word You use to describe him ? ( sighs ) Complicated . Shepherd : Dr. Woods Believes the hybrids have evolved ... That they no longer Pose an immediate threat . She 's asked For a detente . For us to sit down with her son And find a way to coexist in peace . There will be no detente . I 'm not gonna be the man who presided over a mass extinction . We have the virus . We have the humanichs . This ends now . What about Dr. Woods ? Dr. Woods has chosen her side . She stands with the enemy . We 'll treat her like the enemy . ( helicopter blades whirring in distance ) How do you know we 're not being tracked ? The jeep is un-trackable by satellite , Thanks to a few contraptions my buddy ray made for me . Okay , look , I know we 're not on a major highway , but ... Have you noticed that for the past few miles We 've seen nobody ? No cars , no people ... Nothing . Yeah . I noticed . ( sighs ) where is everybody ? ... Shocking news that affects the entire region . There is an at-large terrorist cell In our midst bearing biological weapons . This red-level emergency lockdown Will remain in place for 72 hours . The alleged terrorists Have been identified as former astronaut And gsc employee dr . Molly woods And disgraced second kuwait war veteran James daniel richter ... So he destroyed Our credibility before we could Destroy his . Your " complicated " friend ... Just made us the most wanted people in the world . Do you remember paris ? I remember climbing the eiffel tower And running down the champs-elysées . It was raining , but ... There was a nice old lady , And she gave me her umbrella . It had a hole in it . Both : I was soaked . ( laughs ) so you have All the same memories ? Yeah , lucas and lucy , They share the same neural programming . They all do . Our memories Were installed- - we didn 't have The luxury of learning by experience , like you . But i want to have memories with both of you , too . Okay . Well ... Let 's make some right now . Just the three of us . Charlie , Will you take a picture of us With my pyxis cube ? Yeah . Lucas : What 's that ? It 's a place where people keep their Most important memories- - kind of like An old-school photo album , If you 're into that sort of stuff . Ethan : Lucy , Turn around , smile . Sorry . Let 's do it , Charlie : Everybody say " cheese and crackers . " ( alarm beeping ) What 's going on ? What 's going on is , We are in a security lockdown . What does that mean ? It means we 're not going anywhere For the moment . Shepherd betrayed us . He 's looking for you . And us , too . We 're gonna have to stay in hiding . We don 't want to hide . We want to live and go about in the world freely . Well , i-i don 't want To be the person to break the news to you , But you are a long way from that . We all are at this point . Okay , look , jd has supplies and food . He 's ex-military , So he can help with defense . I can at least help you secure the perimeter . Mm-mm , no . We 're not taking orders From one of them . I 'm sorry , who the hell are you ? This is ares . Jd . Molly . Hey , new guy , I laid my ass on the line for you people . " you people . " Our mother trusts him . Your mother doesn 't know Which side she 's on . Okay , look , This isn 't about sides . It 's about survival . For all of us . We won 't survive here . We should leave now . Scatter into the cities , Propagate until the odds are in our favor , Then let the humans decide ... Decide what ? If they want to live in our world Or die in theirs . I thought you wanted peace . It takes two sides for peace , Doesn 't it ? Richter : Look , there is a five-county lockdown in place . Anybody who leaves here , they will be Hunted down , captured and killed . And if we stay here , we 're sitting ducks . Yeah . But they don 't know where the ducks are sitting . Now , the gsc has a virus ... That can kill all of us . Richter : The streets are empty right now . One person leaves this compound , Just one ... It 's gonna lead the gsc right back to us . Ahdu : If we wait out the lockdown , It 'll make it easier for us to disperse . It 's only 72 hours . Now , we will stay here until then , Help jd secure the grounds . If that 's your decision , brother . Terra : Molly ! Terra . You came back . Of course . Lucy : Hey . Oh . Hey there . Find out how long we 'll be here ? Um ... I just got a special security clearance , So we are going home tonight . That 's good . Yeah . Uh , ethan asked if lucas and i Could spend the night with you guys . I told him it was up to you . No . Lucas isn 't ready . We have to power him down here . Okay . Well ... What about me ? I think with julie in washington , he gets lonely . And you must , too . Me ? No , i 'm fine . But , uh ... Yeah , for ethan , sure . Why not ? Charlie ... I found your checklist for humanichs . What 's an expiration date ? ( clears throat ) you 're not supposed to be snooping like ... I wasn 't snooping . I was looking . John woods made it very clear That he wanted humanichs to have the human experience , So he built in a program For them ... To expire . You mean ... Die . I mean ... Humans die . It 's just part of the deal . It sort of defines us . To make humanichs more human , It just seemed logical to build in ... A termination point . It 's not logical To me . Humans have to die ; we don 't . If you want us to be more Like you , then give us the same rights . Let us really live before we die . ( sighs ) Look , i 'm so sorry you had to find out that way . I know it 's a lot to absorb . You 're responding like any human would . Because i 'm more human than you think , charlie . I wish you understood that . Nate : Believe it or not , Mei fong 's dna Has somehow been converted to a triple helix . So you 're saying , conclusively , That this woman is a hybrid ? She will be . Soon . A casualty of microchimerism . We think there was a placental transfer Of alien fetal cells during the pregnancy . Does this happen to every woman who survives a hybrid pregnancy ? I don 't know . Mei has a rare genetic marker Called the " kilimanjaro allele . " it might be why She 's changing and others aren 't . Run that marker through Our employee database . Only one person with that same anomaly . Molly woods . Can you stop the progression in this woman ? Maybe , with a full plasma and marrow transplant , But ... It could kill her . Do it . We need her consent . With all due respect , she has rights . Mei fong is now an enemy of the state . Consent is not required . You have your orders . We thought molly woods was on the other side . It turns out she is the other side . Where are you going ? To see taylor . Don 't you think it 's about time I met him ? When taylor thinks it 's necessary , he 'll let me know . I figure we might want to get one or two of these things running . What ? Why are you doing this ? You know , when i was a kid , my dad and i , We used to take old cars and work on them And put 'em back ... I 'm ... Not talking about the engines . I 'm an enemy of the state now , molly . Not a lot of options . You could just dump all this stuff off and leave . I 'm not a deserter . I 'm not saying that you are . Molly . Heleos and some others have volunteered to keep watch . We 're making up sleeping quarters . We weren 't sure whether you wanted one bed or two . You know what ? I , uh , i 'm not gonna sleep tonight . I 'm gonna keep watch with ... Heleos . Yeah , heleos and i are gonna keep watch . Come . Let 's get you settled . So , heleos , how old are you , one month or two ? Excuse me ? ( chuckles softly ) Never mind . Gallows humor . Come on . Male a.I. : Who are you ? Tobias shepherd . Identification confirmed . What do you know ? K-27416 ... W-45113 ... M-9808 . Password confirmed . What do you have ? Alexander the great tetradrachma . Object confirmed . Hello , taylor . Hello , general shepherd . What can i do for you ? I need analysis of every location That might serve as a compound for the hybrids . Certainly , general . When would you like these projections ? Yesterday . That 's impossible . Can i assume that 's sarcasm ? Yeah . You can . It is . Just get it done . ( crickets chirping ) ( aural fractals sound ) ( gunfire , men shouting ) Man : Jd ! They found her innocent . Molly : Stop it ! Right now ! Jd ? You son of a bitch . Molly : No , no , no . Jd , no ! No , stop ! He 's running our perimeter lines . I thought we should get to know The man in charge of our survival . Yeah , is that how you treat your friends ? He 's your friend . A man unfaithful To his wife ; Left his daughter ; and who had a hand In the deaths of hundreds of his own kind . And you ... You ask us To trust that ? Okay , you need to go . ( exhales ) He 's just trying to protect us . Yeah , i feel real safe . Heleos . 48 hours , and we were done here . Meaning ? Meaning this was supposed to be a pit stop , Not a parking lot . When we first got here , It was about you figuring out how to reverse What was happening to you . I don 't hear you talking about that anymore . Because i don 't even know if i can reverse it . You 've stopped trying ! These people , They aren 't like us , all right ? They are unknown . And what am i ? Am i an unknown ? You need To figure out which world you want to live in . You can 't have both . Charlie : All right , What do you think ? An oldie but a goodie ? I 'm sick of children 's stories . I want something more grown-up , like lucy would read . Oh , really ? Like what ? Uh , well ... Julie 's been reading huckleberry finn . How about that ? Really ? Julie said she 's reading that ? It 's supposed to be a classic . Very advanced thematically . I want that one . Okay . Got to cater to your audience . ¶ ¶ ( sighs quietly ) John and julie ? Did you find it ? Yeah . Yeah , i found it . I 'm sorry about that . With ares . Jd has been ... Nothing but kind ... Helpful ... And generous . I know he 's unhappy here . And you 're wondering if you should be here ... Or with ethan . You see ? See , you are in my head . You know my thoughts and my feelings , And that 's what i don 't want . You can control what 's happening To you , molly- - the headaches , The urges . You see that they 've already started to recede . I don 't know ... What i am . Yes , you do . And your best chance of survival is embracing that . Why are you still awake ? Why aren 't you powered down ? I was bored . You get bored easily . Whose pyxis cube is that ? It 's julie 's . There 's no photos of you on it , only ... John woods . Was that her boyfriend ? ( wry chuckle ) Seems so , huh ? But wasn 't that molly woods ' husband ? ( laughs softly ) You really don 't learn By experience , do you ? Are you making fun of me ? Me ? No . Sorry . I get surly when i drink . My heart gets pummeled . I 'm sorry for your pain . Well , you know , that 's the thing about humans- - We all want what we can 't have . Humanichs are like that , too . Yeah ? What do you want that you can 't have ? Lucy ... Sometimes you like to remind me that i 'm just a machine . You 're not just a machine ; you know that . The more human experience You give me , the more human I become . I can be so much more if you let me . Wait , hold on . Wait . Wait , this is ... This is illegal . It 's like misuse of government property or something . Is that all i am ? Property ? No . Of course not . I want to feel what humans feel . Oh , my god , i could go to jail . Only if someone tells . Wai-wai-wait . No , no , wait . Wait . Wait . ( charlie panting ) Don 't you like me , charlie ? That 's not the point . This just can 't happen- - for so many reasons . ( pants ) i 'm sorry . You , You need to go power down , and i ... I need to go pour out the rest of this drink . ( exhales ) We have task forces combing every hot spot taylor gave us . Still no trace of where the hybrids are hiding out . We haven 't lost yet . No ? With schools , banks and business districts Still shuttered , there is outrage over the disruption Of everyday lives . With public pressure mounting to end this lockdown , There is still no word on the whereabouts Of former astronaut molly woods and her accomplice , Disgraced war veteran jd richter . They 're playing this thing like a war . But it 's not a war , it 's a scourge . We 're running out of time . We need to get personal . Meaning ? Everyone has their achilles ' heel . ... These terrorists are . What do they want ? Even jd richter . Newswoman : With this lockdown due to end in 24 hours , will the gsc Dare to extend it and risk rioting in the streets ? And in another twist , kelsey richter , Daughter of suspected terrorist jd richter And circuit court judge dorothy richter , Was taken into custody today ... What the hell ? ... Under the provisos of the loyalty act . So the seven beautiful sisters were playing in the meadow , And then along came ... A hunter ... Named orion . And orion wanted the sisters all to himself , So he chased them To the ends of the earth . But just when he thought he had them trapped , The most powerful god in the universe , Zeus ... Came along to rescue them . You came to rescue us from the hunters . Are you a god ? No . None of us are gods . But you 're still what daddy says you are . And what is that ? Our leader . We have to talk . How can they do that ? It 's bs about aiding a terror cell . There 's no depth shepherd and his cronies won 't sink to . He just wants to get your attention . He got it . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know , but i can 't sit in sherwood forest Hoping they live up to the ideals of the constitution . I can 't . I won 't . I 'm sorry . You 're not going anywhere . Seriously , man , you gonna stop me ? Ares . He knows our location . He could lead them straight to us . You don 't know me very well . I know humans- - and i 'm not about To bet our futures on your professed loyalty . Jd , don 't ! Ares , stop it ! This is not a prison . He 's free to go . Yeah , he 's going . Hey ! Get away from there ! Get away ! I thought by now you 'd have some intel On where the hybrids might be hiding . Taalr : So did i , general , But to my surprise , initial sat-scans came up negative . So , what , we have nothing ? Not yet . But i am currently exploring a new theory . Well , i 'm listening . In order to find life , Perhaps we should be looking for the absence of it . Meaning ? If the hybrids could emit an emp powerful enough , They could create a thermal hole in my sat-scans . A blind spot . Precisely . Which would allow them to hide in plain sight . What am i looking at ? Osgood listening station , Closed in 2025 due to defense budget cuts . This is an old satellite image of the area . This was shot this morning . Something is blocking my scans , Something that wasn 't there six months ago . Gated ... Tunnel systems , easily defendable ... Well , this has to be it . What 's your recommendation ? Release the virus in conjunction with the deployment Of the humanichs army . And if we withheld release of the virus ? In 6.5 months , the homo sapiens genome will be diluted To the point that an extinction event is inevitable . ( alarm sounds ) Charlie , what is that ? You 're being called up . Ethan : Lucy , are you leaving ? Yes , i have to go now . This early ? When will you be back ? I 'm not sure . I 've , uh , been called into duty to fulfill my programming . Is lucas going ? Yes . Can 't i come with you ? Come with me ? Ethan , do you think i want to go to war ? I want to stay here and play video games and go outside , But that is not my function ... Is it , charlie ? So , no , ethan , you can 't come with me . You 're not like us . You never will be . Hey . I 'm sorry about last night . Don 't worry . At least not today . We have reason to believe the target is located At the coordinates currently being uploaded To your nav system . Lucy , you will lead the recon op . Sir ? At 0700 , you and a subordinate will infiltrate the area . You will gather intel on the hybrids ' position , numbers And defensive capabilities . Keep your distance . Do not engage the enemy . Understood ? Yes , general . I 'm sorry . I know this is hard for you . You 're doing the right thing . Molly 's made her choice . Now we 've made ours . Toby . I 've also made a choice . I 've put in for a transfer . To d.C. I think it 's best . For both of us . If that 's what you want . It 's not , but if i stay here , I 'm never gonna get what i want . ¶ ¶ Hey , will you do me a favor and hand me that screwdriver ? So you 're leaving . Yeah , soon as i get my truck running . I 'm sorry to see you go . You might be the only one . I appreciate what you 've done for us , jd . I know it hasn 't been easy . You 're a good man . Look , i wouldn 't go that far . Do me a favor , all right ? Keep your eyes open . Stay alert- - these guys aren 't gonna Stop looking for you until they find you . Understood . ( engine starts ) ( engine turns off ) Molly , i , uh ... I can 't desert my daughter . You don 't owe me an explanation . No , i ... I probably do . Just know that i hate deserting you . We 're doing what we have to do . Maybe in another life , things could have been different . In that other life , you have two phds and a ticket to space . And i 'm just a bum watching you in a ticker-tape parade . Thank you . For everything . In another life . In another life , molly woods . Yeah . ( engine starts ) Our orders are " recon only . " That 's molly woods . We may never get a clean shot at her again . They must have a reason for their orders . The element of surprise will be lost . Heleos : Who are you ? Hi . I 'm lucy . This is , uh , my friend lucas . We 're just out here deer hunting . We lost the buck we were chasing . You 're not humans . What are you ? Take him . General shepherd , we found them . All of them .

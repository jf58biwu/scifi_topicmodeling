 Good . Thank you . Yes . Yes . Yes . Right . They 're gonna be here in 10 , okay ? So , be ready . Don 't screw up . Of course not , boss . Go . That 's a big box . Tiny tykes measured in at well over 100 inches , and I 'd say 900 pounds each , wouldn 't you , Russ ? A hundred pounds of beak and claws , and the mangiest feathers you ever laid your beautiful brown eyes on . The male is a bit bigger than the female and a hell of a lot more pissed off . What 's the matter ? You afraid of a big bird ? Harvey , maybe we should rethink releasing them in the aviary this quickly . - Doing ... - Stop . Stop . Stop . I did not hire you for advice . I hired you to be my bird watcher , okay ? Unacceptable . Do you think this is wise ? They could hurt themselves in there . Better than hurting us out here . They will be fine . All we need to do is an initial check , make sure my babies weren 't harmed in their voyage . Do you realize what today is ? Do you realize ? Today is the day that the past has collided with the future in the pursuit of knowledge that no one else has . No one . Only us . And you know what that makes you ? What ? It makes you pioneers . Like Lewis and Clark , or Darwin , or Copernicus . Now , there 's a man who changed the view of where we stand in this universe today . Right , Russ ? What he said . Are they down ? Shut up , you idiot ! Hey ! You bastards awake ? All right , why don 't you go join them ? Go join them . Go . Go . Yeah , okay . Okay , I think we 're good . Open it up . Are you sure about this ? What ? Do you think they 're faking it ? They 're freaking birds , for Pete 's sake . There 's a reason people coined the term " bird brain . " Not much up there . Maybe you should get in the car just in case . I think you 're right . How we doing ? We 're good , boss . All right , let 's do this . I think we 're good . Okay , let 's drag those bastards out of there . Time for the good doctor to see how Heckle and Jeckle are doing . Okay , that 's weird . Hey , I hope you didn 't kill this ... one . I 'm gonna get in the car , too . Get out of the way ! Move it ! Don 't shoot the bird ! Another weekend with Mother Nature ? Yeah . What you going in for this time ? Birdwatching . I 'm hoping I can find a Falconidae caracara . Falconacara what ? A Mexican eagle . Another watcher spotted a nest about four miles north of here . What the hell is a Mexican eagle nesting up in these parts anyhow ? They 've been living in these regions for hundreds of years . No wonder San Antone lost the Alamo ? Done planted a bunch of spies up in the sky . Yeah . That cover it ? - Okay , you have a good weekend . - Yeah . You go out and find yourself a big bird now . Will do . Come on , Dad . Pick up . Hello , this is Keith Stern . Sorry I can 't come to the phone right now . But if you could please leave a message , I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . Have a great day . Hey , Dad , it 's me , your loving daughter . I was just thinking about you . I know you 're probably on one of your crazy bird adventures , but give me a call . It would have been Mom 's birthday next week , so I 'd like to do something special . Call me . I love you . Look at that ? It 's a thing of beauty . So , Slater , she still over at the compound ? - She only popped in for lunch . - All right . Speaking of lunch , when 's the next feeding ? Should be dropping in any minute now . What the hell kind of birds are they feeding out here ? Hey . How we doing ? - Any luck ? - Nope . We 'll have to start over . What ? What the hell is going on ? I mean , this is the finest incubation equipment on the market . It 's not the equipment . Two of the eggs had microbial contaminations . Same as the last . How can this be possible ? All it takes is one bad egg to spoil the entire litter . What 's causing the contamination this time ? - I think it 's the soil . - The soil ? By the time your men are finding those litters , primitive bacteria has already contaminated them . I mean , as you 're aware , those birds thrived ... They thrived in regions this far north . Soil now is different than it was two and a half million years ago . I think you would probably have had better luck trying to breed them on one of the islands where you found them . Well , that 's not gonna happen , is it ? You know , I hired you because you 're the best at what you do , right ? So if there 's something to be done with the soil , please do it , because it 's been six months , okay ? Fix it ! Fix it ! Well , unless your men are planning to catch that hen 's next litter as it comes falling from her rear , I really don 't see how you expect me to make this happen overnight ! And I need more time . Fine . Do it . What the hell is that ? Gonna do me some fishing later . Fishing ? Yes , sir . Light one of those babies , toss it in , all the fish come bubbling up to the surface . Easy as pie . Here 's your money . Next time you come around , you leave that stuff at home . You got it ? What is this ? It looks like someone 's pet . Looks like it 's not your day , Old Yeller ? You 're bird food , you mangy mutt . Help ! Go ! Go ! Help ! - Get to the gate ! - Where is it ? I don 't see it ! Get to the gate ! Keep going ! Don 't touch the fence ! It 's electrified ! Please ! - Quick ! - Get back ! - Let me out ! - I 'm trying ! Let me do it ! What 's the new combo ? Come on ! Get me out of here ! Let me out of here ! - Where 's your gun ? - It 's on the car . Go get it ! - Hey , who are you calling ? - My dad . He 's going birdwatching again this weekend . Trying to get some prize photo for this nature competition he entered . Nature competition ? Yeesh . Thought I 'd catch him before he left the cabin , though . Dude , your dad seriously needs a girlfriend . He loves his independence . Nut doesn 't fall far from the tree . How the hell did neither of you see that some schmuck got into the aviary ? And how did you not see him get past the compound fence in the first place ? We never saw him on the feeds . And I don 't know how the hell he got past the voltage fence , but the main fence anyone can hop right over . Must have got in on the east side , down by the river . The birds never go there . It 's covered in trees . I bet he went up over . Yeah , you know , the birds mostly stick to the western region anyhow . That 's where they 've been hunting these mutts . - Who cares ? He 's in . He clearly got through . Now , we have a dead man on our hands , and what are we supposed to do with this ? How are we supposed to deal with this ? Could find his car . Stage a crash somewhere . That 's a great idea . Yeah , maybe we can just prop up his half-eaten skeleton and put it in the driver 's seat . What do you want us to do ? Shut up so I can think ! What 's there to think about , Harvey ? The jig is up . Another man is dead . And I doubt he 's some ex-con no one cares about like the last one . Have you lost your mind ? They 'll shut us down . They 'll take away my birds , and god knows what they 'll do with them . No , I found those birds on my expedition . They 're mine . And they 're dangerous . Harvey , they 're dangerous . Why do we have to tell the authorities anything ? They already think this is a cat ranch . We just tell them the man got mauled by a big Bengal or something . No , no , no . No , no , no , no no . No , the rules change when an animal kills a human being , okay ? Having a permit and a promise to put them down is not enough . They 're gonna come do an investigation . They 're gonna wanna see the animal . No , we say nothing to anyone . - Got it ? - What ? Are you kidding ? That man could be married . He could have a family . He could have children . You just can 't dictate someone 's death like that , Harvey . The man is a trespasser . Think of the birds for a second , okay ? Think of the birds . Think of what would happen if those birds get into the hands of this corrupt government . Come on . We are this close to hatching them . Now , don 't you think we at least owe it to a dying species to at least try ? This isn 't about the birds , Harvey . It 's never been about the birds . And your big , archaeological expedition ? Just another notch on an endless ego belt . We all know you 're a money man , Harvey . And when you hatch an entire flock , you 'll do what you do best . You 'll take all the credit , and you 'll sell them to the highest bidder . Hey ! You don 't walk out that door , because you work for me , and you do what I say . Screw you , Sullivan . I quit . Let go . Come on . Just ... Just tell him to let me go . I gave you everything that you wanted . I gave you a house in the Hamptons . I gave you everything that you asked for . Well ... why don 't you go get Dr. Slater 's car for her so she can leave ? Where 's my car , Dale ? It 's just down the drive there . My keys . Dale , don 't do this . Don 't do this , Dale . My things are ready . Please have them picked up in the morning . I hate to see you go , Doc . Me too . Come on . Come on . Come on . Da ... Come on . Come on ! Dale ! All right , tranq ' em and put ' em back in . Hi , this is Keith Stern . Pick up . Sorry I can 't come to the phone right now . But if you could please leave a message , I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . Have a great day . Hey , here 's a little percolated roast to perk up my fave roomie 's afternoon . Thanks . Hey , no word from your pops yet ? You know what ? It 's probably okay . He 's probably climbing some mountain , finding some bald eagle 's nest or something . You know , it 's gonna be okay . It 's Friday . He said he 'd be back Tuesday at the latest . Yikes . Well , what are you gonna do ? I ... am gonna look for him . Have you thought about maybe calling the police first ? Well , my dad keeps a GPS tracker on him whenever he goes out into the wild . My mom bought it for his birthday two years ago and made him promise to always keep it in his gear . The receiver is at the cabin in the woods , so I 'm gonna start there . Maddy , you can 't traipse the backwoods by yourself . That 's insane . Paige , I 'm going . End of story . Fine , I 'm coming with you . Paige , you don 't have to come . No , you 're crazy if you think I 'm letting you go out there by yourself . Justin ? Hey , it 's Paige . So , Maddy kind of needs a favor . Yeah , you know that big , bohunk friend of yours , the one that 's into all the outdoorsy stuff ? Brett , yes ! So , we could really use his help . Maddy 's dad is missing . He went camping , and no one has seen him since last week , so ... Really ? Could you ? That would ... That would be amazing . Of course you can come . Maddy would really like that . Yeah , we 're packing right now . I 'll text you . Thank you so much . So , what makes you think Maddy would like that ? 'Cause Maddy does not . Are we talking about the same Maddie here ? 'Cause the one I 'm referring to used to be totally in love with her inseparable best friend , Justin . Yeah , before he got a girlfriend . Okay , how many times do I have to repeat myself ? The guy obviously started dating that sorostitute in the first place to make you jealous , okay ? - You 're the one who went AWOL on him . - Paige ! I 'm stressed out enough about my dad as it is . I don 't need any more added anxiety , all right ? Now , just call him back and tell him not to come , all right ? Maddy ... will it or will it not help us to have an experienced hiker on the trail help us look for him ? Okay , you said it yourself how crazy-far your dad is willing to trek in order to take some snapshots of some strange species . Okay , give me five to pack . Looks like you bought yourself a little time , my friends . Chef has pulled the canine cuisine from the menu . The birds had themselves a nice , little Slater soufflé last night . Just get ' em out , Dale . Hey , guys . He did not bring that slutosaurus . Hey , are you okay ? Thanks , you guys , but you really didn 't have to do this . Are you kidding ? I would have been pissed if you hadn 't called me . Anyway , besides ... it 's the weekend , right ? We didn 't have anything better to do anyway . Yeah , nothing better . Nope . Look , it would have been the same old beer pong and keggers . My liver ... could use a break and a little fresh air . Hop in . Thanks , Rough and Tumble . Taylor , so great to see you , but you really didn 't have to come . Two desperate girls in the wild with my boyfriend ? Yes , I did . Yikes . Sorry . Window seats give me the regurg . I 'm gonna need to sit bitch . Fittingly . All right , let 's do this . Fill her up , man . I 'll tell you what . How about I put $ 4.50 in there and take the rest for you trying to punk me ? Turd . My god . Hi , excuse me . Excuse me . Hi . Yeah , where 's your nearest ladies ' room ? Never again , Justin . Excuse me . Could you tell me ? My dad , he comes through here all the time . I don 't know if you know him . He , drives this dirty , old jeep . He 's got a cabin down by the river bend . Yeah . Yeah . He was just through here last week . Going out to find him some kind of crazy bird . Mexican barracuda or something . But he hasn 't come back through ? I ain 't seen him . He doesn 't always stop passing back neither . - All right , thank you very much . - Yeah . - Hi . - I 'd like to pass please . What 's the magic word ? You wanna play ? Okay , well ... seeing that we 're all alone in here , I 'm gonna guess the password is ... Lay a finger on me , and I will kill you . Get out of my way . Hey , are you okay ? No , Justin , and I won 't be until I get a freaking bar of service on my cell phone . Gosh ! Did you hear those kids ? You know exactly who they were talking about . So , what happened to you ? What happened to my little baby ? Let me check that . Russell to Sullivan . You copy ? What ? We may have a little problemo . The kid of our recent bird fodder friend is on the prowl with some kids looking for him . Over . Do they have any leads ? Nah , just asking questions to the store clerk on the county road . He 's dumber than nails . Over . Well , people go missing in the woods all the time . Copy that . We 're heading back now . With my containment equipment . Hood fumes and all , sir . Over and out . Do you know where those kids went ? Can 't say that I do . I probably wouldn 't tell you if I did . No . That hot chick left her cell in the bathroom . I was hoping I could just catch up with them and give it back . They went east . You best hurry . This is it . Right up here . Keep going . Well , he definitely hasn 't come back . That 's his jeep . Where in the world are we ? There he is . Why isn 't he moving ? Perhaps he got bored and fell asleep . What ? I know I would . Maddy , he 's just birdwatching . I imagine you have to sit pretty still in order to not spook the birds . About how far out is that ? Any idea ? I don 't know . It looks like maybe ... seven , eight miles maybe . All right , that 's where we 'll start . We 're gonna need some maps . Now , just in case he fell , or got hurt , or something , you got a first aid kit around here too ? Yeah , I think he keeps one under the bed in the bedroom . Taylor , would you grab it please ? Hogeye County , that 's the one . Right there . Looks about right . Not bad , soldier . Looks like pretty rugged territory . Yeah , the more remote the better for my dad . He can get closer to birds that are unaccustomed to people . Hey , check it . This little blinking light thing is fading out . No ! No , no , no , no ! Please ! Please ! Please ! Please ! Please ! Why are we taking our bags ? Mother Nature is unpredictable , Tay . - It 's always better to be prepared . - For what ? You know , in case we have to camp out or something . Camp ? I don 't understand why we don 't just call the police . I mean , surely they 're better at handling this type of thing than a bunch of kids tramping around in the forest . We report it , and then what ? They sit on it for 48 hours until they do something ? No , thanks . He 's already been gone a week . I 'm not waiting around anymore . Hey , Tay , just think of it as camping out overnight for the newest handbag line at Nordies . Hey , there 's the trail . Hey . Hey . Hey , we 're gonna find him . Okay , look , we know his last location , and he 's gonna be all shocked when we barge in there and interrupt his birdwatching . Okay ? Come on . What if he 's not there ? Come on . So , how 'd you know I was into camping anyhow ? Get over yourself . You know your five-foot friend , Phil ? So , I work with him over at the West Campus Coffeehouse . He swoons every time he talks about the way you handle a fishing rod . I mean , no , it 's not like I have a problem with gay dudes or anything . It 's just that we , like , lived together in the same dorm room freshman year . I know . I also know that you sleep nude . - He told you that too ? - Yeah . So ... So Phil digs me ? At least as much as I dig chicks ... No , it 's nothing like your web browser history would lead you to believe . So , sorry . So , guys , I think we should take a minute . So ... Why didn 't you call me ? I don 't know . I guess I was just so worried about my dad that I ... No , I don 't mean this morning . I mean , like , either of my calls a few months back . And then every time I text you , I get this terse , one-word response like , " Yes . No . Sure . Cool . " Like you feel obligated to humor me or something . No , it 's not that . It 's just I 've been busy . With bio labs and stuff ? Yeah . That 's bull , Maddy , and you know it . You 're , like , one of the smartest people I know . In fact , our entire sophomore year , you were finishing your papers weeks before I did when we had class together . Well , yeah , that was before . Before I had classes for my major , so you don 't know how difficult some of those labs can be . Fine . But I do know when you 're lying . - Like you 're lying now . - I 'm not lying . You so are . You 're making the exact same face you made the night we double dipped at the Dobie Theater and then got busted by that usher with the terrible breath . He was like , " May I see your ticket ? " God ! I didn 't lie . You did . Please . I was too busy laughing at your reaction , but ... you were a terrible liar then , and you 're a terrible liar now . Maybe if you would have been a better liar , we wouldn 't have gotten kicked out . My god ! " Sneaking into a second feature " without paying is a serious ... " Dude , like , so is your breath , so ... Ew . - Totally . You know ... I 've really missed you this semester . So , whatever I did to make you mad , I 'm sorry . Justin , it 's not you . It 's just ... Guys , what 's so funny ? Nothing . Just reminiscing our sophomore year . Sophomore year . Okay , that 's the year I was crowned homecoming queen and became president of the equestrian team , right ? I love that year . Well , somebody 's mood sure has perked up since this afternoon . Well , this wilderness girl selife I was trying to post finally went through . Random ? I think there must be , like , a tower in the vicinity or something . You guys wanna take a picture together ? Have fun . What 's up with that ? I don 't know . I 'll take a picture with you . - Okay . Gosh , we look so good together . It 's , like , ridiculous . Yeah . Where 's the bridge ? Ain 't one . So , how do we get across ? Seriously ? Brett , this is the backwater . Do the words " gator bait " mean anything to you ? Contrary to popular belief , gators don 't like to attack anything they can 't swallow . And who told you that , little bitty baby gator or big , fat papa gator ? You know , Brett , she does have a point . Taylor doesn 't attack anything she can 't swallow either . I mean , that 's never stopped you before , has it , Tay ? A lesbian comic , what a novelty . My god ! My dad 's watch ! My god ! He must have crossed the river right here . That 's why it was hanging right there . No , I 'm sorry , Justin . I cannot cross this water . That 's fine , babe . That 's cool . You can stay here and wait if you like . You , look away . Ew ! something just touched me ! Something ... It 's got me ! - Just hold on . - It 's got me ! Justin , pull ! Justin , what is it ? What was that ? It was a branch , Tay . Your panties got caught on a big , fat branch . A branch ? Okay , well ... Well , I haven 't had my panties pulled on that hard since the back of Tommy Swanson 's pickup truck on prom night . They feel dry enough . Get dressed everyone . Daylight 's a-burning . Is it weird that there 's stairs here ? Maybe somebody owns a summer house or something . Okay , summer house or not , I do not wanna be stuck here in the dark , okay ? How much farther do we have to go ? Let 's go another half mile . That 's where his GPS was . Yeah . At this point , it might be good to start calling out his name . See if he can hear us . Keith . His name is Keith . Keith ! - Keith ! - Dad ! Keith ! - Dad ! - Keith ! Maddy 's daddy ! Maddy 's daddy ! Maddy 's daddy ! - Keith ! - Genius ! - We must have taken a wrong turn . - No . No way . According to the map , the tracking signal was some 200 yards north of here ... which is right through there . How would he have gotten in there ? Maybe he knows people who lived here and stopped in for brunch . Looks like some sort of government-regulated facility . Why would my dad be in a government facility ? Maybe he 's assisting special ops for some sort of Mother Nature-inspired biological warfare . Hey , special ops over there , why don 't you cut the conspiracy theory ? You 're freaking out bottle blond over here . So what do you wanna do then ? I wanna find a gate and see if anyone will let us in . Guys , it 's gonna be too dark to walk back if we don 't go now . We can take this road so we don 't have to go through the woods . Yeah , in the dark ? We have flashlights . Hey , someone 's standing guard over there . Excuse me . Hello there . Man . We 're not terrorists . We 're just college kids . This is private property . Move along . But wait . My dad ... We think my dad is already on your property . Come again ? My dad , he 's somewhere in there . We keep a guard posted here around the clock . I can assure you your father is not ... on these grounds . But , sir , we tracked him here . Are you guys on drugs ? Are you tripping on shrooms ? No . No , sir . We 're sober . But we 're just looking for our friend 's father . He was carrying a GPS tracking device in his camping gear , and that device is somewhere in there , and we think her father might be , too . Please , can we just come in and look for him ? We 're not gonna steal anything . You can watch us . Okay , you kids hang right there . Sullivan . Yes ? This is gate . I know . I 've got a couple of kids here , and one says her dad is on the estate grounds . Over . All right . Maybe we should let them in , and we can get this settled . 10-4 . Would you like me to escort them ? They 're on foot . Over . No , that won 't be necessary . Just have them come down the main road . Have them wait for me at the aviary fence . Thank you . Guys , I really don 't like this . Doesn 't anyone find it odd that they 're allowing us to just waltz across their property without an attendant ? It 's obvious some rich guy owns the place . Probably has security cameras in half these trees , too . Yeah , not to mention the electrical fence surrounding the entire property , ensuring we couldn 't escape even if we did try and steal something . Yeah , see , that 's what concerns me . Rich people like to keep their stuff safe . Yeah , but what kind of normal rich person lives this far out in the backwoods ? Finally , Tri Delt has a valid point . Thank you . What do you think is in there ? Maybe horses . What kind of horse needs a fence that high ? Could have some exotic game . Maybe ostriches or water buffalo . Guys , according to this , that GPS device is right through there . Can 't we just go back to Maddy 's cabin , and shower the filth of this forest off of us , and then come back tomorrow maybe when a third party knows where to find us ? Taylor , we can 't just bail on Maddy 's dad right now , not when we 've come all this way already . Justin , do I have " suicide " written in pink lip gloss across my forehead ? No , I don 't think so . I 'm not going any farther . I 'm sorry . Taylor , this is exactly what I was talking to you about last week . Sometimes , you are the most selfish ... Justin , wait . I think Taylor is right . I think we should go and come back tomorrow . You guys have done enough for me already , and it 's getting late . It 's gonna be dark soon . - What ... - Taylor ! Taylor ! Taylor , wake up ! Taylor ! Taylor , wake up . Run ! Run ! Paige ! Nice ! Nice ! What happened ? We found another one at the cabin , out cold on the ground , big knot on his forehead . All right , so what do you think ? Do you think he 's with the other kids ? Well , when we saw him at the gas station earlier , we didn 't think he was . All right , good . Good . So , what about the car ? We just took care of it . All right , so we 'll take care of the vehicles later . We 'll put the ... We 'll put the kids in the barn . And that new kid , I want you to give him a sedative before you put him with the other kids . All right . I 'm gonna need a sleeper though . I 'm out . I 'm loaded , buddy . Don 't let him get away ! Come on ! No worries . I got this . Woo wee ! I could get used to this ! Hey , don 't be such a Neanderthal , Dale . We 're not murderers ! We 're doing this because we have no choice . Paige . Wake up . - Dude ... - Paige . I got hit in the head with a baseball bat . Try knock-down tranquilizer dart . What the ... We were attacked . And what is he doing here ? Dude , I think I have a conclusion . It 's " contusion , " half-baked . I don 't get it . Why would the guys let us go ? Yeah , and where the hell are we ? Out by the river . I can hear it down there . Who were those guys ? Wait . What guys are we talking about ? You didn 't see them ' cause you were first knocked down , but there were two big guys coming down the drive with dart guns . How did you get here ? I was on my bike . They kidnapped me when I stopped on the side of the road . Right . And why were you stopped on the side of the road ? Take a piss . You 're an idiot . Guys , stop . We 're in this together . Well , do you remember them saying anything , or do you know where we are ? Maddy ! Hey , Maddy ! Guys ... I think these are my father 's footprints . I thought you said your dad was on the other side of that big cage that we saw . Yeah . And my guess is we are too . Wait . Cage ? What the hell cage are you talking about ? I don 't know . It was some sort of electrical , fenced-in pen . It was eight feet tall . Well , what the hell is in the pen ? What was that ? Some sort of bird . It sounded more like a banshee . Guys , come check this out . So , maybe this is an ostrich farm . No . I ain 't never seen no ostrich with feet that big . Maddy , where are you going ? I 'm going to find my father . In the same direction as those big bird tracks ? Nope , I don 't think so . You can do whatever you want , but I 'm going to find my dad . Maddy , come on . Don 't be crazy . We are in here deep . We need to get out of here now , call the cops , and send someone back after your dad , okay ? Maddy ... that is the best way to help your dad . Fine . Which way should we go ? I think the south fence line should be somewhere right through there . Everybody . Do not make a move . Do not take a step . Do not make a noise . Dude , we 're sitting ducks in this clearing , man . Yeah , but if we can see them coming from all four sides , they can 't spring a surprise attack . I 'm getting the hell out of here ! Where are you going ? - Maddy , what are you doing ? - We might need this . What the hell is that thing ? Everybody back up very slowly . Paige ! Everybody run ! - Over here ! - Come and get us ! Hey ! - Here ! Here ! - Maddy , look out ! Come on ! - Hey ! Over here ! - Come and get us , ugly ! Pull your legs up . My god . Maddy , are you okay ? Let me see the leg . Let me see your leg . It looks ... No . No , not so bad . Not so bad . We do need some disinfectant right away . - Can you check your dad 's bag ? - Yeah . And we gotta stop the bleeding too . So now what are we gonna do ? Guys , any ideas ? Just hold on . What 's going on over there ? That thing plucked her leg . Yeah , and I 'm gonna pluck her in the head . Taylor , try your phone again . Your dad 's Swiss Army Knife . I gave this to him ... last Christmas . It was right after my mom passed away . She was always against those things . Too bad she didn 't have one the night she drowned in that car . She might have been able to cut herself from that belt . Hey . Hey . Hey , Maddy . Be with me right now , okay ? Okay . Can she walk ? Yeah , we think she can walk . I 'm not walking anywhere . That thing is still out there , and for all we know , there could be 20 more of them running around . And what the hell are they ? They 're definitely not ostriches . And aren 't all the dodos extinct ? They 're not dodos . Well , then what the hell are they ? I think they 're called terror birds . Terror birds ? That 's light . Try " scare the crap out of me , send my ass into a pecan tree " bird . I 'm serious . I think they 're called terror birds or Titanis . My dad knows everything about every kind of animal that ever existed . Growing up , it 's all he ever talked about . Those birds should be extinct , though . Clearly , they 're not . Maybe they 're genetic clones like in that movie . Who cares ? They 're real , and they wanna eat us like some salty , sweaty student skewers . Now , how are we gonna get out of here ? If we found a tree that was tall enough , I think we could get over that electrical fence , easy-breezy . Yeah , but how are we gonna get there ? We 're gonna need some bait . Wait . What do you mean " bait " ? You don 't really think those guys that put us here are gonna let us hang out in these trees all day , do you ? We have Maddy 's dad 's water and enough pecans to eat for days . So let 's see who caves in first . Kids are in the trees . Birds are on the ground . Kind of funny ? Yeah , that 's really funny . You wanna know what 's really funny ? You 're the one that 's gotta get them out of the trees . How are we supposed to do that ? Well , I don 't know . Why don 't you just hit them with a dart maybe ? I don 't care what you gotta do . Shoot them . They 're teasing my birds . Go . Do it . You want us ... to go out there in the aviary ? Do what you did before , bring your tranqs . Go on . Do it . Go ! Looks like both the birds are back . I think that 's the one that had Paige . Yep , that 's the one . Hey , you ! You are one ugly creature ! You hear me ? Yeah ! U-G-L-Y ! You ain 't got no alibi ! You ugly ! Yeah , yeah , you ugly ! Maybe you shouldn 't antagonize it like that , Taylor . I 'm sorry , Mr. Birdy Bird . Did I insult your feelings ? Taylor . My god . Friends helping friends . Ain 't that cute ? All right , get down here , all of you . Justin , what are we going to do ? They have guns . What else are we gonna do ? Hurry it up ! Let 's go . Come on ! Toss that pack over here , sweetie . What do you want from us ? Well , we were trying to make you the birds ' breakfast , but clearly , you 're a bit more resourceful . Well , most of you , anyway . Clever little Polly 's crackers , ain 't they ? A lot more clever than their father was . That 's for sure . Just let us go , okay , and we won 't say anything to anybody . We 'll just say that we got attacked by some massive mountain lion . You thought this speech out , haven 't you , hot stuff ? I bet you 're at the top of your class . Or , you know ... at least working your way to the top . Screw you , you backwater bacteria . Now , we 're gonna give you to the count of three to head that way back into the forest before we start putting bullets in your head . How does that sound ? One ... Two ... No , no ! Everything ! I gotta do everything myself ! Are you in ? Let 's go . I think the kids escaped . Think so ? Well , so did my birds , because you let those kids get ahold of your keys . Yeah , but who 's gonna get the birds back in the sanctuary ? After they 're done feeding , you 're gonna load up on darts and pray you don 't miss . Russ ! Russ was dead . Yes , I know . Those damned birds tore him apart . Yes , I know . I saw the whole show on the monitor , all right ? Now , what we 're gonna do is I 'm going back to the laboratory where it 's safe . You 're gonna stay here . Keep an eye on that driveway . Make sure the birds don 't get past the house . Understood ? Yeah , but I don 't think ... Or you could go out and help my babies finish their job . - I 'll be right here if you need anything . - That 's good . How are we gonna get through that gate ? We got his keys . Well , I guess it 's our lucky day . Guys , they 're coming back . Justin , you 're never gonna make it ! Come on ! It stalled ! Maybe those keys work on that barn over there . Let 's go . Hell ! Base to Bio . Base to Bio . You look good . You look good . Base to Bio . Base to Bio . You look good there . Base to Bio . Base to Bio . Son of a ... Justin . Justin , hurry . I 'm trying . There 's a lot of keys , and there isn 't one labeled for the barn like the gate . My god ! They 're coming ! Dude , you gotta get that key right now . Justin ! That 's my swinging arm , baby . That ugly beak of yours is about to hit me a grand slam . My god ! Justin ! Boy , you kids , you sure put a damper in my afternoon , haven 't you ? Six months , this ranch has been a safe haven , a place of peace for my baby birds . A safe haven ? You killed my father . No , dear . No , your father got himself into this mess when he trespassed on my property when natural selection chose him as food . No , I 'm no murderer , dear . You tried feeding us to your giant parakeets . Pretty sure some states consider that murder . I can 't let anything interfere with my operation , at least not until the little ones are hatched . Are you kidding ? You really want these things to reproduce ? You bet I do ! They 're the last two of their kind . I 'm just trying to help them survive , save a species . By sacrificing your own kind to feed them ? That 's balanced ! You kids are the only ones who cost innocent lives today . Now I gotta spend the rest of the afternoon trying to find new wranglers . And you know how hard it is to find new wranglers ? I mean , wranglers you can trust . Look at me . Of course I do . Okay , Blondie , let me ask you this . You know what it costs to keep somebody 's mouth shut ? Probably not any more than it costs for your Italian import shoes . Welcome to the food chain , you bastard ! Get away ! No , no , no ! No ! If there 's one thing I know to do , it 's divert a guy 's attention . We need to make a move for it now while they 're still eating . Where to ? What about in there ? Maybe there 's a phone . You don 't know that . But there will be one at the house . It 's too far . You 'll never be able to outrun those birds . Watch me . I did track in high school . Taylor ! Let me look at it . I think we should find a way out of here . We 're not going anywhere until I look at your leg . Besides , I don 't think that thing can get through that door . I think you got a lot of dirt in it . I 'm gonna have to wrap it better . Well , it looks like we 're in the right place . What do you think this place is anyway ? I don 't know . It looks like ... Like a hatchery or something . So either they hatched them in here or ... they were hoping two of them would lay eggs . Can I borrow your knife ? My god . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . No , I should be sorry . For Brett , and for getting all of you into this mess in the first place . - I am so sorry . - No , no . Maddy , it 's not your fault . Besides , I 'm not the only one who lost someone I cared about today . We 're gonna make it through this , okay ? I hope Taylor is okay . Me too . But I gotta admit ... I 'm thankful that the person I care about the most ... is still right here in front of me . You do know I only dated her to get my mind off you , right ? I never really had with her what I have with you . Justin , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I pushed you away . But it 's only because I felt the same way about you , and I just didn 't know ... Maddy , Maddy , I get it . I know all your defense mechanisms . And I now that it was hard for you to get close to people after your mom died . But I let you push me away too , and I never should have . But that doesn 't matter anymore , right ? Because it 's never gonna happen again . Yeah . Thank god for that knife ? Looks like somebody has been looking out for us today from afar . Hey . Hey . It 's okay . Do you think that door is gonna hold ? I sure as hell hope so . You 've got to be kidding me ! That 's weird . Hello ? All right , all right . Keep it down in there . What the hell ? What 's wrong with you mutts ? Hey . Hey , so ... it looks like Sullivan found the two birds in these neighboring islands in the Caribbean . He was funding a dig in Trinidad for some rumored buried treasure all his yuppie friends in Barbados caught legend of from locals . What a better way to waste money than to spend it all searching for more ? But what does the treasure have to do with the birds ? Well , they didn 't find anything in Trinidad , so they expanded the dig to nearby islands , only ... the natives refused to take them to two of the islands , claiming they were home to death birds . Needless to say , Sullivan was thrilled by the prospect . I didn 't think that there were any uncharted islands left . Well , these are charted , Navassa and Caparo . So , why didn 't anybody know that the birds were there ? Well , it seems like they were pretty small islands . Totally uninhabited too . Only the natives did know . They even claimed their ancestors hunted down what was left of them . But since no one of any prominence had ever seen them , everyone else just chalked it up to local myth . So if the birds were staying so concealed , how did he find them ? Bait . He put goats all over the island , monitored them for weeks to see where they would disappear . Clever bastard . So Sullivan found his buried treasure after all . Only two in the world left of its kind . Just like he said . Too bad we 're gonna kill them . Miss Biology ! You do realize that we 'd be responsible for the extinction of an entire species ? Sure do . Good . Glad we 're on the same page . My god ! Crap ! Hey , don 't move ! Where 's Harvey ? He 's in there . We might be stuck . There is no way that bird is leaving if we 're up here . Well , his ranch house is just up there . All right , I mean , if we find weapons in there , we can maybe get past that guard . But what are we gonna do about that ? I have an idea . Hey , you big chicken , come and get me ! See how excited it gets when I scream ? Yeah , I don 't like it . So I record myself screaming into my phone , I press repeat , and I throw it as far as I can that way . You really think that 's gonna work ? It 's worth a shot . All right , but we 're gonna have to be quick . If that bird goes after the phone ... I mean , those things are clocking in at well over 20 miles an hour . Let 's just hope my arm gives us a good enough head-start . All right . Ready ? Hey , you big chicken , come and get me ! Hey , you big chicken , come and get me ! Hey , you big chicken , come and get me ! I don 't hear anything . It 's so far away you can 't hear it . It worked . Let 's go . Hey , you big chicken , come and get me ! Come on ! Move ! I can 't . No keys ! My god ! You 've got to be kidding me . I don 't see it . It must still be out ... in the field . Okay , any sign of that thing taking a step towards us , and I 'm back in the van , okay ? Okay . Anything ? No . Let me try the other one . - Still over there ? - Yeah . Wait . What do you mean " wait " ? Justin ... I think you should get back into the van . Right now . Go ! Go ! How are we gonna open that thing ? - We 're not . - What ? We 're gonna smash right through it . Are you crazy ? This isn 't the movies ! That could be reinforced steel or something . Justin , don 't do it ! Damn it ! Look in the back . Maybe they have another gun . I don 't see one . There 's dynamite . Bring that over here . Hey , you prehistoric , overblown turkey , come and get me ! Okay , do it . Here it comes ! Go ! Go ! Roasted bird ? How much you wanna bet it tastes just like chicken ?

 For centuries , mankind has been the dominant species . We 've domesticated animals , locked them up , killed them for sport . But a series of recent events seem to suggest all across the globe animals have decided : no more . And so we were hired , a team of people from different backgrounds , with different specialities : an expert in animal behavior , a journalist , safari guide , foreign intelligence agent , and a veterinary pathologist . Our task : to find out what is happening with the animals , why it 's happening , and how to stop it . Previously on Zoo ... That 's a bat . - Flying a little high , isn 't it ? - And a little too early in the day . - Do you have family ? I never asked . - Yeah , we 're not close . As you can imagine , I 'm an acquired taste . - Okay . Why are you in Mississippi ? - I believe that 's what you would call classified . You know , in America , we have this thing . It 's called inter-agency cooperation . Mm . You should try it sometime . Perhaps I will , but not tonight . Good night , Agent Shafer . Over here ! Those are Hartley 's clothes . So where is Evan Lee ? Well , we 've been here for two days . And already , we 've discovered unusual bacteria inside a wolf that 's behaving abnormally . That 's an accomplishment . I found this . It 's his Hartley 's . It was in his cell . I also found this . - That Evan Lee Hartley ? - That 's my father . - Anything yet ? - You know what 's guaranteed to make this go faster , Jamie ? You saying anything yet every 25 seconds . Okay . I know . I know . I know . - But we 're running out of time . - Running out of time . I know . Here 's something . Evan Lee Hartley wrote this name all over his Bible ... Leo Butler . Let me see . I can 't find anything to explain why he kept this picture of him and my dad , but ... Leo Butler here and here . Here . Who 's Leo Butler ? - Hey , now . - What ? What is it ? Looks like a type of Alcanivorax bacteria . Kind they use to clean up oil spills , eats hydrocarbons . Okay , well , how did it wind - up in the blood of a wolf ? - The usual way . It went from a primary consumer all the way to a tertiary consumer . Professor , remember your audience . I spent every one of my science classes thinking about my English homework . The food web . Chain reaction . ♪ There was an old lady who swallowed a cat ♪ ♪ She swallowed the cat to catch the bird ♪ ♪ She swallowed the bird to catch the spider ... ♪ - Mitch , look , we really got to get going . - ♪ That wriggled and jiggled ♪ ♪ And tickled inside her ♪ ♪ She swallowed the spider to ♪ ♪ catch the fly ♪ - ♪ I don 't know why she swallowed the ... ♪ - Mitch did you hear that ? - Let 's go . - Hang on a second . - I think I got something . - Mitch , we really got to go . Yup . On my way . Mitch , we are going to get caught . We have to get out of here right now . Mitch ! Move ! Hey . Slipping out without getting caught by the teacher . Takes me back . Oh , oui . Yeah , once I increased the magnification , I saw a chemical signature . A string of benign molecules that have no bearing on the bacteria whatsoever . Audience , Mitch . Remember it . It means the bacteria was man made . And it was signed by the chemist who created it . - Then we need to talk to this chemist . - Not that easy . Think of the signature as a ... a graffiti tag . I saw it , but I still have no idea who painted it on the wall . - So we 're at a dead end . - Not yet . I forwarded the signature to a guy I know at M.I.T. He might be able to come up with an I.D. for us . Pack your bags . - We 're going to Rio . - I love this job . - What 's in Rio ? - You said if you could find out what all of these animals we 've encountered have in common , you can maybe find a way to figure out what 's happening . Well , - you can add bats to your list . - Bats . Thousands of them swarming all over Rio , in broad daylight . - That 's weird , right ? - What , the daylight thing ? Bats are nocturnal , but it 's not unheard of . - Thousands of them though ? - Yeah . Oh . Excuse me , guys . Can I talk to you for a second ? I 'm not going to Rio . - Jackson ... - I 'm going to find Leo Butler . You don 't know that Butler is in any way connected - to your father . - And you don 't know that he 's not . That was my guy at M.I.T. He was able to I.D. the signature . It was a chemist who used to work at ... - Reiden Global . - What ? I 'm sorry . The company that you all keep telling me isn 't the root of all evil ? That Reiden Global ? - Did you a get name ? - I did . Leo Butler . Leo Butler ? - Why ? You know him ? - No . But I sure as hell want to . Okay , Jackson , you stay here with Jamie and you find this Leo Butler . The rest of us will go to Rio . The pilot has turned off the fasten-seat belt sign . You 're free to roam about the cabin ... They can 't fly this high , you know . Bats . They can 't fly this high . You were flying at a much lower altitude when they came at you in Japan , so nothing to worry about . At least until we start our descent . Meantime , in order to keep your mind off all things bat , I thought , uh , I 'd offer up some facts . - Facts about what ? - Facts about bats . - Bat fact number one . - Oh , God . Their , uh ... their wings are actually webbed fingers . Bat fact number two : the phrase blind as a bat kind of a misnomer . I mean , they don 't see too well , but same can be said for some of us , right ? Word on the street is that Butler has been blackmailing Reiden ever since he went underground and dispersing the money to various charities , charities all over the world that give the money to people who 've been wronged by Reiden . - Are these internal Reiden documents ? - Yeah . I 've made some friends over the years . Bloggers . Hacktivists , People Under The Stairs . But they got us these . This is completely illegal . I like it . Okay , well , - we have to find him . - I 'm getting close . A guy 's got to live while he 's out there being Robin Hood , right ? It appears Butler has been paying himself with a portion of the blackmail money ... routing it through shell companies with P.O. boxes all over the Gulf Coast . I think with a little time and some luck , - I can get his actual address . - Wow . This is ... this is good . Miss Campbell . Agent Shafer with the FBI . - We met at the prison . - Yes , of course . Agent Shafer . I see what you did there . You , uh ... you said my name louder than necessary as if to alert somebody in your room of my presence . Yeah , my subterfuge game isn 't so tight . Well , frankly , it 's terrible . - How 'd you know we were here ? - Ms. Tousignant asked me to keep her in the loop on the Evan Lee Hartley manhunt . She told me where you 'd be staying . Agent Shafer . Please . - Come in . - Great . No . Jackson , I don 't think ... So , have you found him ? - Hartley ? - Uh , I didn 't say that . I implied it so you 'd let me in . See , his subterfuge game is tight . Well , I am a trained professional . - What do you want ? - What does Reiden Global have to do with the prison fire ? - Why do you ask that ? - Well , Reiden was hacked yesterday , and somehow , some of their documents found their way into your e-mail address . - How ... ? - We have a cyber crime division , you know . We 're good like that . So , first , I find you scam your way into a crime scene at a prison , and now , you 've hacked into Reiden Global . So , how about you tell me what you 're really up to ? I have a friend at the Brazilian Intelligence Agency . When we arrive in Rio , she will brief us on the situation . Sounds like a plan . Proud to be part of it . Ladies and gentlemen , we are beginning our descent into lovely Rio de Janeiro . - What is it ? - All flight attendants , please return to your seats . Bat fact number three : apparently , it 's worse than we thought . Joey cut his hair . - Can you believe that , Henry ? - Oh . Here 's something about Tristan . It says he has a black lab named Esther . It 'd be fun to go out with a boy who had a dog . Or even a boy who didn 't have a dog . Okay . Good boy , Henry . You okay ? Sweetie ? Okay , baby , come on . - You okay , kiddo ? - Yeah . It wasn 't a bad one . And Henry warned me in time . Hey , you know , you can 't just arrest him before we 've had a chance to talk with him first . Sure I can . In fact , I have to . Once I called the Bureau to pinpoint Leo 's location from a list of P.O. boxes , it became an official FBI investigation . - Even has a case number . - You have to give me 15 minutes with him first . Look , I already agreed to let you come along on this little boat ride . - Now you 're giving me orders ? - 15 minutes . That 's all we ask . Miss Campbell , you just told me that Leo Butler 's blackmailing a multinational corporation . It 's a federal offense . Out of everything we told - you , that 's your takeaway ? - Federal crime , Federal Bureau of Investigation . You see the linkage ? How about the fact that when this guy was working for Reiden , somehow Leo Butler created a bacteria that caused those wolves - to attack a prison ? - Let 's see . Leo Butler , a blackmailing embezzler , invents a bacteria that accidentally creates prisoner eating wolves . That 's what you want me to tell my bosses at the Bureau ? That 's a better takeaway ? We want to know what - is driving the bats wild . - So do we . What business is that - of the French government ? - I 'm sorry . I cannot say it . State secrets . Of course . In any case , it 's nice to see you in the field . Congratulations . So the bats ... have your scientists done - any testing ? - Sim . And the good news ... they have determined the bats do not have rabies . - And the bad news ? - Rabies is the only thing that would even come close to explaining this . - Your friend is a scientist . - One who would love to know what responses are being considered . The plan on the table is to drop a version of Endrin on the bats . Endrin ? Come on . You can 't be serious . - What is Endrin ? - It 's an insecticide . Outlawed in the States and most developed countries . It 's like chemotherapy . Kills the cancer , but attacks everything else , as well . You do realize you 'd be risking the health of every single living thing in Rio . And we are considering that very issue . But you 've seen the bats . People are frightened . Well , at least give us some time , 'cause if you kill them all , we 'll never learn what 's causing this behavior . I 'll do what I can . - Thank you . - But I make no promises . You know , I can 't help but notice , - for a city under siege by bats ... - No bats . Not here , at least . Why over there and not here ? Hey , wait . We can 't go in there . We don 't have a warrant . Good thing I 'm not a cop . - What 's the cage for ? - Damned if I know . - Whoa ! Federal agent ! - Wait ! We don 't want to hurt you . Or maybe we do just want to hurt you . Come to Rio , jewel of South America . I 've seen this before , this kind of Jerry-rigged power , in poorer African villages . This place might as well be a separate city , cut off from all official services ... utilities , plumbing , power , telephone service . To survive , the people are forced to improvise . Why do you suppose the bats congregate here , - of all places ? - ' Cause it 's less sanitary here ? More insects ? More food for the bats ? I don 't know . I got to get ahold of one of these things , study it up close . Gabriela was able to delay the pesticide drop until morning . Still doesn 't give us much time , does it ? It 's okay . They 're shooting at the bats . Mitch . After you . What are they doing ? Sometimes insects like to nest in transformers . Maybe the bats are feeding . - What ? - Get down ! Must have been a chain reaction . _ - What did you do ? - Nothing . We 're only studying the bats . - You 're French ? - Yes . My friend , we don 't want any trouble . - And where are you from , big papa ? - Africa . Gonna wish you never left . You might want to reconsider . - _ - _ Shall we lower our weapons and have a discussion ? An American , an African , and a French woman . If you 'd walk into a bar together , we 'd have the beginning of a bad joke . Rio has many sights popular with the tourists , but ... this neighborhood is not one of them . Tell your men to stand down . We 're no threat to them . The fact that your gun is still raised says otherwise . Chloe , please lower your gun . Perhaps we should pay these men for their time . A token of our inconveniencing them . - You have been around . - Here and there . That 's wonderful . Souvenir . Look , just tell us what you know - about Evan Lee Hartley . - I don 't know who that is . Your name is written on almost every other page of his Bible . Well , that 's suitably eerie . What about Robert Oz ? - Robert Oz . Does that ring any bells ? - Oz . No . Should it ? Are you gonna hit me again ? Jackson . Please . Look , we need your help . - Please , can you just talk to us ? - So if she 's the good cop and he 's the bad cop , - what does that make you ? - Oh , actually , I 'm the only cop . We need to talk to you about Reiden Global . - No . No . No way ! - Leo , please . No way ! I 'm not getting involved in this . They 've got people everywhere ! You could be involved with them for all I know . Leo , I 'm from Folsom , Louisiana . - Does that mean anything to you ? - Of course . There 's a brand new library there ' cause of you . I heard it came out beautiful . What can you tell us about the Alcanivorax bacteria ? What is taking him so long - to find Henry ? - You let the dog out again with the fence still broken , and you 're gonna complain that your stepdad hasn 't found him - in a timely fashion ? - I know , I know . I just keep forgetting that it 's not fixed . - When will it be fixed ? - When I hit the lottery . That would be such a great story . It would make the news . Mother of a dying girl wins big . Story at 11 : 00 . - Clementine . - You 'd be famous - and me and Henry , too . - I don 't want to be famous for that . - Hello ? - Henry got hit by a car on Cranston Street . - I 'm on my way to the vet now . - Oh , God . What is it ? What is it , Mom ? What are you looking for , - exactly ? - Anything abnormal . Some sort of clue as to why they 're behaving this way . Could take a while . That 's why I never had any patience for science . I 'm going to walk to that pastéis . - Does anybody want something ? - No , I 'm good . - Chloe ? - I 'm good . Thank you . I didn 't want to say anything in front of Abe , but when your friend was talking earlier , uh , Gab ... Gabriela , about seeing you in the field , - what was that about ? - I 've not seen her in a long time is all . Yeah , I don 't think that 's it . Not seeing how you played it with those street kids . Might have been nice if you or your boss would 've told us that our field leader has no field experience . I 'm entirely qualified for whatever we may encounter while carrying out this mission . Yeah , see , even that sounds like you read it out of a spy novel . Someday , I would like to meet this person who made you become this thing you are today . Was it his mom , who didn 't hug him enough ? A college girlfriend who broke his heart ? Or was he always the last picked on the sporting teams ? It was all those things . Hang on a second . The eyes have changed . Shape is different . Here , come here . Take a look . Pupils are bigger . That 's not dead . - That is not a dead bat . - That ... Definitely not . So you mimicked the wolf 's brain inside a coffee pot ? That 's actually ... That 's quite brilliant . Our brilliance really isn 't the message here . And then the-the coffee pot ... - exploded ? - Literally . Oh , galloping crud . Okay , kiddies . You 've had your coffee klatch . - Time for Loopy Leo to go to jail . - No , no , ten minutes . - I 'll give you four . - Jail ? - Who said anything about jail ? - Leo , could the bacteria you created have caused the wolves ' behavior - to change ? - No . - Not the bacteria ... - Leo , please , if there 's something that you know , just tell us . Look , a lot of guys would not have given that money to charity . I know you 're one of the good ones . Ever wonder why Reiden is so much more successful than all of their competitors ? It 's because they have a vector that 's better than all the others . - Really ? - Okay . I 'll be man enough to admit it . I wouldn 't know what a vector is even if the Wi-Fi in this creepy shack was working . A vector is a DNA molecule used to manipulate cellular material on a genetic level . Still haven 't gotten any smarter in the last five seconds . It means they have a molecule that allows them to be faster , better , cheaper . Okay , then why doesn 't everybody else just get - their own ? - Because they can 't . Among other things , the vector is extremely rare . Outside of Reiden , you are the only other people who know it exists . Only a select few inside Reiden even know where it comes from . They call it the Mother Cell . That doesn 't sound ominous at all . They discovered it about a dozen years ago . Preliminary testing proved how powerful it was . By the time they realized the potential side effects , it was too late . They 'd already invested too much money to back out . - What side effects ? - I don 't sleep anymore , because I lay awake at night counting all the different ways they could kill me . I 'd arrived at 16 . - 16 different ways ... - Leo ! Side effects . It 's doing something to the animals , isn 't it ? - Do you know where it is used by Reiden ? - Maybe you don 't understand . The Mother Cell is in every single product Reiden makes . It 's everywhere . It 's all over the world , and it can 't be stopped . No one is gonna hurt you . Just get us the Mother Cell and all of this will be over . We can protect you . - Right , Agent Shafer ? - Absolutely . I keep it hidden , - not far from here . - Fine . - We 're going with you . - No . Absolutely not . - Look , you don 't have a say in the matter , pal . - I certainly do . I just won 't retrieve it for you . Well , then you can just go to jail . That still doesn 't get you the Mother Cell . Wait , what if I went with you ? - Just me . - Jamie , forget about ... One of you guys punched him in the face , and the other one 's a cop . I would understand ... That would be entirely acceptable . - It would ? - Entirely . We 'll take my boat . Vet says it 'll cost $ 3,000 . - $ 3,000 ? - He 's gonna need follow-up surgery . On top of Clem 's treatment ? - How can we ? - You 're not gonna like this , but ... - maybe we should call him . - No . - Aud , I 'm just saying . - Why ? - Because he bought her the dog ? - He is her father . She hasn 't seen him since she was two years old . No , I am not gonna call him and guilt him into paying for this . Okay . We 'll go to Plan B. - We have a Plan B ? - Sure . Plan B is we make it work . We 'll fix Henry and we 'll figure it out . But we are not gonna let Clem lose her best friend . - Why are you so anxious ? - Still not sure letting her go alone with that guy - was the right thing to do . - Oh , please . You see the way he looked at her ? Like he 'd been wandering the Sahara Desert for five years - and she was a lake of root beer . - Huh ? It means he may ditch her , but he 's not gonna hurt her . But just in case ... bang ! - What ? - I hacked into Leo 's account . Now , he syncs his phone with his computer , so I can access the GPS on his phone . - You hacked into the account ? - Yeah . - What kind of a federal agent are you ? - A good one . All right , that 's them . If he 's able to ditch Jamie and disappear with the Mother Cell , we can track him . You know what , keep an eye on them , will you ? - Hello ? - Hello , Jackson ? It 's Chloe . - How are things in Rio ? - Good , good . Um ... it 's quiet . At the moment . Mitch is examining a bat . He discovered an abnormality in its eye . I swear to God , I am gonna kill that man before this is over . Yeah , I ... I may beat you to it . And Abraham ... he has his dark places , - no ? Oui . Yeah . Perhaps someday he 'll tell you about it . - So did you find Leo Butler ? - Yeah , we did . He doesn 't know my father . But listen to this ... he may ... Chloe ? Hey , what 's going on over there ? You okay ? Hey , Chloe . Hey , Chloe . - Chloe ? - I 'm sorry , I have to go . Is it possible that the bat was attracted to my phone or to technology ? I mean , - is that crazy ? - Well , crazy seems to be on a sliding scale - since I met you guys . - The plane in Japan ... perhaps the bats were attracted to its radio waves . And what about the solar panels in the Antarctic ? And those power poles in the favelas weren 't shielded properly . I think you are using the wrong words . Being attracted to something - is not the same thing as attacking it . - Well , I don 't know . I once threw all my ex-wife 's clothes on the front lawn ' cause I was attracted to her . All right , are you guys familiar - with the-the trophic scale ? - Well , pretend we 're not . The trophic scale is an index of where everything falls on the food chain . Apex predators are a five . They 're at the top . Sharks , tigers , birds of prey ... predators that eat other predators . Humans , contrary to popular belief , are only a 2.2 . Alongside pigs - and ... anchovies . - Anchovies . Now , only two things allow us to behave like fives . Our ability to reason and our technology . They 're still on the move . Looks like they docked his boat . Now they 're in his car . - What are you doing ? - Leo Butler 's name is written all over Evan Lee Hartley 's Bible . Maybe something in here - will tell me why . - All right , hold on . We don 't have a warrant , so none of this can be used in court . Spare me the ethics lecture , okay ? You just hacked into the man 's computer . I 'll start on this stuff . But they can 't know it . The animals , the bats . - Can 't know what ? - That 's it 's only our technology that keeps us from being their prey . Are you asking if the animals have somehow developed a ... hyper intelligence ? Whether they know it or not , this mission of ours has just become a whole lot less amusing . - How far can bats see ? - Uh , depends . Some can only see 25 feet , others can see up to a few hundred yards . - Why ? - We go far out into the forest and we hook up something with an electromagnetic signal , and we boost it somehow so the bats can 't miss it . Once there , they 'll be too far away to see any other electromagnetic source . Exactement . So maybe they remain there . All right , whoa . Whoa . Let 's try and remember our designations here , okay ? I 'm the scientist . You 're the analyst . Still not sure what you are . - But it could work , yes ? - No . Yes . Maybe . If we ... If we had something that gave off that kind of signal . How about a cellular antenna ? - Like the one at the favela ? - The favelas ... Yeah , uh , you don 't remember what happened - to us out there ? - Real cellular antennae ... those owned by phone companies ... - will be secured behind locked gates . - No . No way . Do you have another idea ? - You support this plan ? - Well ... I mean , guys , we have to do something . If we don 't , the government will drop poison from the sky , and as you yourself pointed out , that poison will affect every living thing in Rio . Including us . Stay here . - Where are you going ? - To get it . The Mother Cell . Almost forgot . - What are you doing ? - Contributing . I 'm gonna sell some of this stuff to help pay for Henry 's doctor bills . Sweetie , don 't be ridiculous . Wait . - Where did you get this ? - From your closet . I didn 't know I still had it . You know I love Justin , Mom , - right ? - I know . But ... do you think - if I got really bad ... - Baby . - ... that he would come ? - Clementine . - Do you ? - I don 't know . I really don 't . Hey , guys . Here , boy . It 's them . - Is he okay ? - He 's gonna be fine . He just needs to take it easy for a while and take his meds . Welcome to my world , Henry . Exactly , babe . And I 'm putting you in charge . Just like you 're good about taking your medicine , you got to be good about giving Henry his . I can do that . Thank you so much , guys . Thank you so much . He must be starving . Come on , Henry . Time for supper . Come on . - Thank you . - Plan B. Make your kid smile . Everything else will take care of itself . Hold on . - What is it ? - Looks like some sort of ... inventory of products that contain the Mother Cell . And how and where those products were used . You 're telling me that all of these products have this Mother Cell in ' em ? But this is everything from ... - dog food to weed killer . - I know . Voilà . - Wow . - I know , right ? I got to admit , I 'm kind of glad to be shed of it . Soon as I pack up my stuff , I disappear , for good . Now it 's your problem . I 've got the truck . I 'll be there in five minutes . We 'll be ready . Think I almost got it . Almost got what ? I can 't even begin to understand what 's happening right now . Do not . You 're making a mistake . Only mistake was keeping Enzo on his leash earlier . - Hidey ho . - Hey . We 're ... we 're actually - just trying to solve your bat problem . - Oh , yeah ? Aliado , it looks to me like you 've got a bat problem all your own . Here , look . That 's the one I 'm gonna buy . And I 'm gonna name her Ventus , - which is the Latin word for wind . - Wow . Beautiful . You 'll have to take me for a sail sometime . You don 't have to work the charm thing anymore . You-you got what you came for . Leo , I 'm forever grateful for what you did . And I 100 % want to go for a sail with you when this is all over . - You do ? - Yeah , I do . - What the hell ? - What is it ? - My GPS is on . - Okay . I don 't use my GPS . You ... You tricked me . - What ? - No , no ... Your friends - are tracking me . - No , no , no , no , no . Leo . - No , no , no . - I told you . I told you this would happen . - I knew it ! - No , no , Leo , listen to me . Nobody is tricking you . Where is it ?

 Mya ! Holy crap . Who is she ? What is the history behind this magnificent sculpture recently unearthed on the plains of Arizona in the arid lands of the Navajo Nation ? How old is she ? She , it , does not conform to any known remnants of Navajo history . And the tools needed to construct her suggest a civilization previously unknown . One that may have existed before the dawn of known history . And with your generous commitment we will hopefully unlock this beautiful enigma and find out what secrets she has hidden . Are there any questions ? The young lady in the corner . Miss Sharon Christine Turner , I believe . Scout . Scout . Any plans for tonight , Professor Allen ? - I 'm so glad you asked that . - I 'm glad you 're glad . - Because I have very important plans . - I 'm very intrigued . As you should be , because they are surprisingly devised very cleverly with you as the focal point . I am surprised and intrigued . Please elaborate . They are to wine , dine ... - ... and just perhaps seduce . - Just perhaps . My most trusted colleague , Miss Sharon Christine Turner . Scout . Scout . I like , I like . Really ? Which part ? The dine part . This girl is starving . Yeah ? - So , what do you think ? - Sushi . No about our little show and tell . You think it 'll get them excited ? - Make ' em cough green ? - Yeah . No problem . How could they refuse someone so irresistibly lickable ? I am truly irresistible . But you 've got to change that part about hopefully discovering the truth . - How so ? - To we will discover the truth . - Be positive , young man . - No can do , my gal . - You know us serious academic types . - Like you ? Like me . Can 't make those kinds of promises . Then what kind can you promise me , Professor Daniel Allen ? Oh , serious time now ? Maybe . Okay . I , Daniel Allen promise to Scout that I will forever ... - Be saved by the bell . - Only reprieved . Hey , Bryan . Danny . You calling me from your big deal secret location ? - That I am , my man . - And is this the call the holy shit one you promised me ? No , amigo , no . This is the call saying that holy shit 's not happening tonight . I 'm starting to think that just maybe you don 't have that world changing discovery that 's going to finally put you on top . No , no , it 's for real . Okay , no stop to the top . - Don 't you doubt that . - Oh , I won 't . - Cool . - For now . Trust me , it 's way bigger than your mystery woman statue . - So you say . - So I say . But there 's been a delay , all right ? It 's outta my hands . Sorry . Okay ? Yeah , but I 'm still starting to doubt you . It 'll be worth the wait , pal . I promise you . Oh , boy , oh , boy . Yeah , you might want to be watching CNN tonight . Really ? Really . Okay . Might . Take care , Bryan . Carter . Calling from who-knows-where . - About who-knows-what ? - Yep . - Still trying to outshine you ? - Yeah , maybe . But now , we can directly proceed to the wine , dine , and seduce . Oh , boy , oh , boy . It 's the greatest discovery since ... man went to the moon . Shit , shit , that sucks . Asshole . Okay , all right , something better , something better . Don 't be a fool , be cool . Hi . And a big hi right back at you , Mr. Carter . Yeah . Sorry , I was expecting someone else . I know . The alphabet boys . ABC , NBC , CNN . - Yeah , kinda . - Please don 't be embarrassed . I completely understand . But before you get your 15 minutes ... I would ... we ... were sent to make sure that your incredible ... - Discovery . - Discovery , thank you is what you say it is . - No offense , I hope . - No , not at all , none taken , none taken . I 'd probably do the same if somebody told me they had a ... - ... but it 's for real . - I certainly hope so . No doubt whatsoever . As crazy and as whacked out as it sounds I mean , this is the genuine article , Mr ... . Kontral . But Richard , please . And this is Nicole , my facilitator . - Hi . - Hi . All right , Richard , right this way . Right this way to the greatest discovery since microwave popcorn . Shit . That is wonderful . Alphabet time now , Richard ? So we had to ... we had to cut away about 2,000 tons of ore when they , I ... I found it . See , I at first thought it was just a new strata but when I got closer and saw what those taco boys were digging up ... - I made them clear out fast . - Good for you , Bryan . Yeah , yeah , there 's no way I want them chattering away about this . Nor would I. Look at it . Doesn 't it look brand new ? Like it could have been made yesterday . It does indeed . There 's not a scratch on it . - It 's gotta be over 14,000 years old . - Really ? 14,000 . How on earth would you know that ? Well , age of the ore around it . That 's when the geog ... geologists think it collapsed on it . And look , these hieroglyphics . That 's not any language I 've ever seen . That is incredible . You think that 's incredible ? Wait ' til you hear the most incredible part . You know what I think we got here ? The suspense is killing me , Bryan . This isn 't some old Indian piece of junk . No . What we 've got here is an alien spaceship . An ancient alien spaceship . I 'm talking chariots of the fucking gods here , Richard ! And you know something , I think it 's still working . Feel it . Feel the power inside ? The sucker 's alive . Perhaps . It is , it is and not just from this whatever . The whole area ... - ... is vibrating . - Really ? You know , I believe you 're correct . Damn right . Damn right you are . Nicole . If it is if it is , do you know what this means ? Do you have any idea what this means ? I know what this means . What a goofball . Don 't you ever make light of taking a human life again , Nicole . You know how I feel about that . What you 've just done is horrible . But necessary . Your next priority is make sure no one else understands the true nature of this ... Just a moment , just a moment . Patience , patience . I 'll soon unlock your secrets . And with your generous commitment we will unlock this beautiful enigma . Perfect . They 're going to be coughing green now that you went with my brilliant suggestions . Well , a guy will agree to just about anything after a great ... - Dinner ? - Dinner . How 's that for a dramatic opening image ? It is kind of cool , isn 't it ? Maybe , if we knew what it was . - And who you are . - A legitimate request , Miss Turner . - I 'm Richard Kontral . - And Richard Kontral is ? Just a well-paid messenger boy for some very liquid guys . - And they are ? - Of no matter right now . What does matter is that they might just have had the good fortune to come across a most incredible discovery ? - And that 's it ? - This is a very small part of it . Part of something that 's very , very old . And by very , very old you mean ? Over 14,000 years old . - 14,000 years , that 's ... - Pre-history . Well , known history at any rate . Well , let 's just say well before that overrated sphinx would become a gleam in the eyes of its primitive creator . What do you want from Profess ... us ? To help me figure out what the hell this thing is and what message it 's trying to send us from ... Over the river of time ? Nicely put . And how , Miss Turner , would you like to join us on a wondrous journey along that mysterious river ? It 's beautiful . I had no idea that its surface , was so ... Perfect . - Crafted , sculpted , with tools ... - Unknown . Exactly . That 's ... that 's why I wanted you to actually see it . To understand . Not just view it digitally . - Good thinking . - That 's what I do . That 's the way I am . And you two will help me translate what these writings actually mean if indeed writings is what they are . - In all likelihood . - That 's what we do . We 're going to need textural laser scans of the surface . Of course . I 've already ordered them . - That 's what you do . - Great . Daniel , look at this . The top part of this ... - ... whatever , it 's the same as ... - This . Yes , indeed . I hadn 't noticed that . Well done , Miss Turner . So that would mean that buried below this is ... A vehicle from the stars . Chariot of the gods . - Holy crap . - My sentiments exactly . Okay , let 's not get ahead of ourselves here . That 's a pretty big leap . Perhaps , but I think not . - Why wouldn 't you try to uncover it ? - Yeah , dig it up ? I will , Miss Turner . I most certainly will . But discretion above all . It 's waited 14,000 years , it can wait a little while longer at least as long as it takes to tell its story . And that , of course , is your assignment . - That 's ... - What we do . Not exactly . What we do is translate the writings of ancient cultures , human cultures . - But something from another world . - Not much different . - We 'll try our ... - Make it happen . I know you will . Yeah , sure . What wonders will you reveal ? Why are you also here , mystery woman ? Scout , you okay ? Yeah . You sure ? Totally . Okay . Not from the stars . From our forgotten past . Hey , hon , what you doing ? - Scout ? - Daniel , I know the key . - To understanding , translating these ... - Alien writings ? - They 're not . - They 're not what ? Alien . It 's not a chariot of the gods that Kontral 's found . - Not an alien spacecraft ? - No . They were created by humans . - From Earth ? - Yes . And they left us a message . Well let 's see if we can translate it then . That 's what we do . Not from the stars from our forgotten past . You ready ? The driver should be here . - It 's almost time . - To kiss off all we 've done ? - Now what is that supposed to mean ? - Nothing . Never mind . Come on , don 't be that way now , okay ? - I am what I am . - The woman I love . The woman who figured out the translations . And the woman who 's now acting fucking weird . - You should have stopped at number two . - But I am what I am . Hey , guys , your ride 's here . Thanks , Eli . Your timing was perfect . A really decadent stretch limo . Does it have crystal glassware ? - Eyes wide shut . - Keep your clothes on . I 'll try . Not an alien ship from some other world as we suspected but rather a vessel constructed by an ancient , very human and long forgotten civilization . Now , even though the details of this startling conclusion have been transmitted to you , I thought it beneficial for you to meet the people responsible for so brilliantly translating these ancient writings . Dr. Daniel Allen and Miss Sharon Turner . - Thank you , Mr. Kontral . - Oh , please , Richard . - Good afternoon , everyone . - Good afternoon . Contrary to Richard 's very kind words about our work the etchings proved , because of Miss Turner 's intuition ... - ... to be extremely simple to decipher . - Ray Charles could have done it . Well , not quite that simple , but with today 's high speed computers translations of unknown codes and languages are much easier . There 's no need for a Rosetta Stone . You both are quite humble . - He is , I 'm not . - True . But they were created , intentionally designed so that any reasonably intelligent culture could read them . - And learn . - Which is the translation in your report ? Yes , but that 's only the surface meaning . - I don 't understand . - Well , we 've determined that there are hints to the real attitude and dialect of the the story teller beyond that of the literal translation . - And Miss Turner ... - Scout . Thank you . Has created , composed a draft in which I believe is the true character of the ancient historian . She has revealed the emotional content . Really ? You can do that ? I can . That 's what I do . Then please do so , Scout . This world has been ours for countless millennia ruled under the benevolent bloodline of a name I can 't translate , but now approached destruction . He refused to allow the cosmos to erase all that he has so wonderfully created . He is our Lord God , my lover and through his mighty strength wished to forge a new world a continuing destiny for his people . He tasked me to complete his vision and I have failed unable to return to where he waited . For those who may rise again along this river of time I have inscribed his name for eternity to remember our Lord God . A love letter . - In a way , I suppose . - It is . From across the river of time . - Surprisingly romantic . - And enigmatic . Yes , very . What else do you know about this ancient culture ? - Zip . But with your ... - That 's all . And the craft buried below the etchings ? - Nothing . Richard wouldn 't allow us . - You have all the information . And we believe it is a fantastic mystery . One that I ... we ... want to , can solve . I understand your desire but ... But ? But your assignment has now been fulfilled brilliantly and completely . You have our thanks and the considerable fee that will soon be deposited in your accounts . - Now it 's time for others to continue . - I totally disagree . We 're the ones who did all this research and we can continue this project . Again , thank you . - Hey , come on . - Easy there . - Mr. Kontral ? - Yes ? It would now be appropriate for you to ... Jesus , Scout . Still here , Eli . Talk later . With everything we 've learned , it makes perfect sense for us to continue to see this project through . Your service is greatly appreciated , Miss Turner . - But it is now over . - You do understand that ? - Yes , we understand our agreement but we ... - But we 're the most qualified . We will soon be in communication again with you . - Very soon . - I think we should talk now . Goodbye . - Oh , come on . This is ridic ... - Goodbye . For now . Come on . Yeah , okay . See ya around . Celebration time ? Yeah , sure . I need a drink but not to celebrate . That doesn 't sound so great . What happened ? Nothing . It went mostly fine . - Fine ? - Can we not do this now ? We turned in our report , were patted on our heads , and told to hit the road . That 's not exactly what happened . Oh , really ? Then tell me what did . We wrapped up our job . Our job ? The one we agreed to do and get paid for . Our job . So , discovering , interpreting , what could potentially change the world change the world , that 's just a job ? Change the world ? - I know the world should be changed . - It needs to be changed . But saying this discovery could is extreme . No , it isn 't , Daniel . If what we 've found out was made public , then everyone 's beliefs in reality ... - ... in history , would transform . - Maybe . No maybe . You know I 'm right about this . - Fine , you 're right . - Thank you , professor . But are you sure you 're not pissed just because we might not be getting credit ? Yeah , that 's me , all right . My goal 's always been to be interviewed by fake news . I 'm sorry . I know that 's not you . Apology accepted . Okay , I 'm listening . Tell us what you want us to do . Daniel , I just want us to somehow follow this through . I just want to find out who really wrote those inscriptions . Why did she risk so ... - If it was a she . - It was . Why did she risk so much for her Lord God and her world of 14,000 years ago ? A world that was much more advanced than now . - That 's also kind of major , isn 't it ? - Yes . And what happened to them ? - Why , how , did their civilization vanish ? - That 's a good question . And why aren 't we being allowed to search for the answers ? I don 't know . And no clue as to what Kontral 's bosses are planning on doing next . - True . - I mean , who are those guys anyway ? They certainly didn 't make me feel especially warm and fuzzy . Same . So ? Fuck ' em , we go public . Yes . Right , we tell the world . We give fake that interview . That is why you are still the man and I love , you know . - I do . - Yeah . - Ready for that drink ? - Yes , to celebrate . - Agreed . - All right . Oh , crap . What 's wrong with the ... can you help me ? - Okay . - No , Scout . Oh , sure . - You know you drive me nuts . - That 's my job . Crazy kids . Hey , it 's interview time . Hello , handsome . My God , what happened ? Dr. Allen , Miss Turner . Are you all right ? Are you okay ? Guess we 'll do this the fun way . - Ready to proceed ? - Definitely , showtime . Resolution ? It 's not gonna moisten Halo 's pants , but it 's kickin ' . I 'll take that as a good . 548 ultra , ultra sensitive suckers kissing it . Feeding into this hungry maxi gig baby . Yeah , it 's killer good . - Just get on with the tour , please . - Going in . Now , the images are pretty accurate but what we 're seeing is anybody 's guess . Something bad coming up . Bonus points . - Zoom in and enhance . - Aye , captain . We 're going in . Holy crap . Get more detail on that . We 're at max . Another piece to the puzzle . A Rubik 's cube . An appropriate analogy . - Mr. Kontral . - What is it ? I 'd like to show you something , sir . Zero effect . Like a diamond . - Denser . Infinitely . - Now that 's interesting . It would take something nuclear tipped to break this baby apart . Well , that 's never out of the question . - You can do that ? - You have no idea what I can do . - Shit . - But then we 'd lose our little discovery wouldn 't we , if I went all Strangelove on it ? And I do so want to know what secrets you contain . Kontral , you are one supreme prick . That 's an understatement , Scout . - And he 's sitting on ... - The discovery of the century . Another understatement . Then I suggest , sir , that you decide what you want to do ASAP . You do ? And why is that ? Our sensors are indicating increased , growing activity inside . Circuits , engines , something is starting up . - It 's reactivating ? - Yes . That 's interesting . And I think it 's getting ready to take off . Now , after waiting 14,000 years ? My guess is that it was covered under tons of ore that buried it . And when we scraped it off , something inside said it could now break free . Well , can it ? I have no idea of knowing its power but I 'm pretty damn sure that 's what it 's preparing to do . Well , we 're just going to have to change its plans , aren 't we ? You 're the boss . Yes , I am . - Doctor Allen , I presume . - Crap . Stay down . It 's time for the world to know , Kontral . Now why on Earth would you come to that conclusion ? Nicole . Lock on and execute . No ! I 'm sorry . I couldn 't finish our job . Oh , no ! Hey , hey . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's just a dream . - Death and destruction . - That 's a worry . Everything was burning and I couldn 't stop it . It 's okay . It was just a dream . Remember ? - Yeah , sorry , sorry . - Don 't be sorry . - It was really scary . - Yeah , I figured that . You 're so smart . And lovable . Just barely . Can you hold me ? If I must . Feel good ? It does . Mission accomplished . Remember , we are God 's creation . And the creator of all has placed his divine instructions in the scriptures telling us , no , instructing us that it is our right , our destiny to enrich ourselves from the world 's limitless ever plentiful resources . We must ... This is where you should be . Good food and good people . - Thank you . - You 're quite welcome . Now promise me you 'll find your way home . Okay ? God bless you . You too . Sharon Turner , 22 , is being sought for the brutal murder of Daniel Allen . Allen 's charred and dismembered body was discovered late last night by firefighters in his Oak Palm apartment . Allen and Turner were reported to have been romantically involved and that Allen had repeatedly tried to end their affair . You can 't occupy a booth without ordering something . Coffee . I didn 't order that . No coffee for you . No coffee period . Fucking spill by the fucking upstream chem plant contaminated the town 's water . My idiot boss should close the place . Bad news . Yeah . Anyway , you need this more than coffee . It 's no charge . You look like crap . Thanks , for the sundae . No big deal . Nobody orders dessert anymore . - It 's like a world gone mad . - Yeah . Do you need a job ? No , I 'm okay . Yeah , right . Look , if they ever clean up this water mess , they 're gonna need help here . It 's not too shitty once the owner gets the message you 're not going to blow him . No , really . Okay . Snot . Yeah . Tears . Can 't stop ' em . Bad news ? Bad , bad day . Mary , when we gonna get some coffee ? Ask the president . How bad ? Real bad . Lost ... - Your guy ? - Yeah . No he wasn 't just a guy . He was the only one who saw the real me . He was my best friend before he was ... Look , life goes on , hon . You 'll find another . He was killed today . - Fuck . - Murdered . Double fuck . - And they 're going to get away with it . - What are you saying ? They 're too rich , they 're too powerful . I don 't know what happened . I don 't want to know . But ... - ... you got to make them pay somehow . - But I can 't . Somehow . You can 't let the bad guys always win . And you must fulfill your destiny . Always ringing at the wrong time . And I hate that it 's always broadcasting your location . Stay brave . Good evening . Good evening again one and all . You know why we requested your presence , don 't you , Richard ? - I can guess . - Don 't guess . Tell us . Please . To explain why the ancient craft has yet to be disposed of . Destroyed . The harlot captured . And eliminated . You know that I will ultimately follow your orders . Ultimately ? I ... please do not misinterpret . - Are we ? - I pray not but I would , once again wish to request more time to access its inner workings . We grow weary of explaining to you that whatever it contains can not counter the negative cultural effects of its existence . Even , even if it were not constructed by creatures , monsters , from some other world but built instead by humans identical to us from some long past age ? Even more so . Certainly , you have not forgotten that such knowledge of their existence would undermine our prime means of control . - Of course not . - The time for closure has now arrived . - Has passed . - And I will immediately fulfill your wishes . The relic ground into dust and scattered to the wind . The harlot ? Located and butchered , of course . See that you do . I will . Good evening , Richard . Fuck . What 's up ? Oh , yes , sir , Mr. Kontral . I 'm accelerating the examination of our project . - Cool . - Be prepared to begin with ... This the harlot you 're looking for , shithead ? So melodramatic . How on Earth did you manage to get in here ? Amazing what some guys 'll do for major blow job . - From you ? I don 't think so . - I care not . You do realize you 're not getting out of here alive , don 't you , dear ? - Kind of figured that . - So why the visit ? - To slit your fucking throat . - Oh , such malice . - Yes , that 's me . - How blandly lower middle class . Just because we butchered your pathetic little sweetheart ? - Fuck . - On your knees . Listen to her . It 's the only way you 're ever gonna get a woman to do that , you creep . Why must you continuously insist on referencing such an unpleasant subject ? - Fuck you . - I do like your attitude . So come on , tell me . Just to satisfy my ever inquiring mind how did you manage to slip by security ? No sweat . Your girlfriend stepped out for a smoke . Nicole , I 'm disappointed . Your bosses need a higher level of employment . Oh , well , it 's a national problem . I am sorry we didn 't get to spend more quality time together , Sharon . Oh , well . Dispose of her . That you 'll find she 's really very good at . Holy shit . That 's awkward . You ... heard our whole little confrontation ? I know nothing . Help me . Don 't let this ... Now my hand is seriously pained . It 's about time we put an end to your sad little story . - Mr. Kontral ? - What ? When that woman comes on camera , the readings here , they blast off the charts . - What do you mean ? - From the spaceship . - Really ? - Yep . What , when it saw her ? Point your camera at her . Change of plan . Bring her along with us . Secure her in the usual manner . Welcome , Sharon . Now let 's see if you really are essential to this historic puzzle . Fuck you . Check the readouts . Shazam . All right , here , let me have that . Well , now that is very interesting . You really are linked to our little project , aren 't you ? All I did was interpret some etchings . Just doing my job , you creep . No , you 're far more than that , way beyond random coincidence . This ship lying dormant for thousands of years and then reacting now only to you . Serendipity ? Oh , I don 't think so . Chess pieces are being moved . Go fuck yourself . Now , Sharon if you 're going to be part of history , you 'll have to be a little more elegant . It just can 't wait to meet you . Easy with the camera . Bill me . Come on , let 's take a little walk . I 'll stay here and man the shop . Stay close . And those idiots wanted me to destroy this treasure . Bring her . Well , you were right about one thing . - It is beautiful . - It 's not yours . Oh , whose is it ? - It belongs to ... - To the world ? - To science ? - Yes . Well , that 's not going to happen . Give me your gun . So you and I are going to continue our little walk alone . Just to see what happens . Move . Don 't be frightened . I have a very strong feeling this thing doesn 't want to harm you . Yeah , well , hopefully that doesn 't include you . Wait . A valid concern . On your knees . - What ? - On your knees . - You 're fucking kidding me . - I never kid . Just do it . Put your hands on the surface . Touch it . It is so exited to see you . Now , what do you feel ? I said , what do you feel ? It 's cold , powerful . Wonderful . Cold power . Wonderful . Thank you , Sharon . I don 't think I could have put it any better myself . See , that 's what this has all been about . Cold power , Sharon . Cold power and when I have it at my command when I control it , I mean fully control it , and in my control alone then I 'll take that power and the world will have to listen to Richard Kontral ! Asshole . Oh , shit . Time for a smoke . Nice tin man . Nice tin man . Have fun tonight , bitch . Hello ? Hello ? Anybody out there ? How 's it going ? Hello ? You don 't want to miss the whole adventure , do you ? Your awakening has been duly noted by our tall friend . Oh , God . - And he appears to be very interested ... - Shut the fuck up . Take your clothes off . - What , and get on my knees ? - Oh , please , you 're not that irresistible . Take them off . - Do it , or it 's going to . - Okay , okay , okay . - What ? - Socks , don 't forget your socks . Stop helping me . Queen of outer space . You have no idea of how close you are . Well , then , would you please enlighten me . Since when did we become friends ? Slitting your throat is still my number one priority . Well , that 's a real shame . And here I thought we were getting along so well . Forward . - Even Mr. Ray Charles , right ? - What ? Nothing of interest . The moon ? We 're there ? - Apparently so . - So fast . How is that possible ? Super science . Super power . - So , you haven 't a clue . - Not a one . You 're the first woman on the moon , I believe . Any appropriate words ? Fuck off . And you 're wrong . How so ? I 've met her twin sister . Who is she ? Curiouser and curiouser grows our tale . - Well , that was entertaining . - Since when did you become comedy relief ? - Oh , please , by no means . - Just shut the hell up . Don 't say another word to me . Got it ? Got it . Oh , you got to be kidding me . Sure , after flying to the moon and getting attacked by a killer robot how difficult can it be to put on an ancient space suit ? Why not ? Okay . Ready for whatever . I have to say I 'm very curious to see what awaits you . Stop , stop , stop ! Thank you . Thank you . Thank you so much . Thank you . Thank you . But why , why did you do that ? Not sure . Maybe I 'm just a good person . Thank you . - I really thought I was ... - Or maybe I wanted to kill you myself . Whatever . Just be careful . We 're in this together now , you know . Come back in one piece , okay ? No , fuck you . Journey 's end . Watching , learning while you were dreaming my sweet little scout . Easy , easy . Up , up , up , and away we go . Homeward bound , nice and steady , nice and steady . Second star on the right and straight on to morning . Damn you . Now what ? Asshole . I 'll try . I 'll try . Dear God what have I done ? I 'm going to follow it through , Daniel . Finish our job . Garen . Waiting for Mya . Long ago , the Krell crystal created a world for our people . The crystal 's origin was unknown , lost in time . When destruction from the stars was foretold Lord God Garen bid me to bring the Krell to this world so he could prepare a new home for our people . But I failed , so I have selected you to fulfill my destiny . Will you one day be awakened and thanked for making this new world my Lord God Garen ? On your knees , Sharon . Hey . Hey . Here . Right here . Come on . Come on . Hey , I 'll get on my knees . Queen of outer space ? No way . Into the river of time .

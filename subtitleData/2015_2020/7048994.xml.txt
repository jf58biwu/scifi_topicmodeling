 Previously , on Stitchers ... This is gonna be her first real relationship . Right . I got it . Go slow , if you can . Okay , hold on . Ayo : Her oxytocin levels are rising in response to what she 's seeing in the stitch . Things are heating up . The more physically intimate you guys are , the more it 's gonna mess with your ability to stitch . Wait , you 're handling this stitch ? He 's got the yips . He 's worried about you . I have a history of watching people I care about get into bad situations or worse . Then maybe we shouldn 't be together . Do you know how hard it is for Kirsten to keep seeing her mother like that ? And where exactly does Kirsten see Jacqueline Stinger cooped up ? How could you betray me ? Kirsten , I didn 't mean to , I just ... Can we please talk ? Listen to me ! Just ... ( door slams ) I don 't wanna lose you , but I don 't know how to fix this . Me neither . ( power humming ) ( beeping ) ( whirring down ) ( pants ) ( moans ) Oh , Cameron . I feel so ... Cameron ? Camille ? Aah , is that gas ? Can anyone hear me ? Where the hell is everybody ? Cameron . Cameron ? Cameron ? Cameron ? Cameron ! Cameron ? Cameron . Oh , God . Somebody , please help ! ( theme music playing ) ♪ Take me inside ♪ ♪ Take me inside ♪ Cameron ! Cameron ! ( panting ) : Oh , God . Cameron ? Cameron , wake up . Okay , this is only a little bit personal . - Cameron : Oh ! - ( whispers ) : Oh , good . Kirsten . What ? Where is everyone ? I don 't know . I bounced from the stitch and everyone was gone . ( sniffs ) What is that smell ? - Were we gassed ? - Yeah , I think , maybe . What 's the last thing you remember ? I don 't ... I was prepping for a stitch and then ... Yeah , I ... I said " Ow " and ... Oh my God , my face . Did ... I feel like someone slugged me . Is my cheek red ? Oh , no , no , no . It 's fine . Okay . All right , we need to search the lab . Yep . Yeah , it was like this when I bounced . I 'ts like everyone but the two of us vanished into thin air . What 's with the monitors ? I don 't know , but they 're static in the lab , too . You weren 't kiddin ' , this place is a ghost town . Look . ( gasps ) Ow ! That 's really hot . - Whatever happened ... - We just missed it . Oh , great , even our corpse is missing . Do you remember who he or she was ? Yeah , he was , uh ... She was ... Oh , I can 't remember . Is this a side effect of being gassed ? I don 't know , but it 's got organized attack written all over it . We got to call this in . ( line beeping ) Line 's dead . Okay , let me have your phone . ( keypad beeping ) ( voicemail ) : You 've reached Camille . Leave me a message . Or , you know , send a text like a normal person . - Okay , bye ! - ( beeps ) Camille , this is Kirsten and Cameron . Call us as soon as you get this . We 're worried about you . Who would wanna do something like this , and who would actually be able to do it ? Off the top of my head , Stinger , Blair . Ivy might even be involved . I 'm sorry , you asked . - Oh God . - Okay , okay . Just ... just chill . All right , we just got to stay calm and work out this problem . - We 'll figure it out , okay ? - Okay . Right . Well , whatever happened , it happened during the stitch , so maybe it has something to do with the case we 're working on ? Excellent . The only thing is , I just can 't remember what that case is . Let 's find out . - This can 't be right . - What ? Our records say , our last case was Jake Rowland . Jake Row ... The murdered gamer ? We closed that case , so whoever came in and attacked us wiped the current case off the system ? Wait . Listen . Listen ? To what ? I don 't hear anything . - I ... - Shh ! Who 's there ? Kirsten , I didn 't ... I didn 't hear anybody . - I feel like we 're being watched . - Okay , if there 's one thing we do know , it 's that we 're the only ones here . Let 's go back to my house . Maybe Camille 's there . Maggie ... Camille ? ( gasps ) Ow . It 's really hot . Okay , well , maybe she left in a hurry . Or somebody just grabbed her . Hey . Hey . Hey , hey , hey . Hey , hey . We 're figure this out . Okay ? Please don 't touch me . Not right now . Right . Sorry . I just thought , you know , we could both use some comforting . Hm . Um , I 'm gonna check out Camille 's room . Maybe she left a clue . Can you try the NSA again ? Camille ? Did you get through to the NSA ? Um , more or less . In their less than helpful terms , they are aware of the situation . - Well , are we in danger ? - That 's where it gets weird . They told us not to worry and to stay put because ... " Mother " is looking out for us . Now , in NSA terms , I have no idea what that means . It could be code for Maggie or whoever picks our cases or ... - My mother . - There 's still no way to be sure . So , did you find anything in Camille 's room ? She has blackout curtains on her window that I don 't remember ever seeing before , but then again , there 's a lot I can 't remember today . Look , I know the NSA told us to stay put , but ... There 's stuff between us that we haven 't dealt with , and I 'm ... I 'm not sure I want to right now . I understand . That 's ... But , you know , if we have to stay put , then it makes sense to stay put together . You sure ? I have to admit this isn 't the most inspired penne I have ever made , but then again , your pantry is also a foodie 's worst nightmare . I know . It was Camille 's night to get groceries . Has anything come back to you from before you woke up in the lab ? ( sighs ) Nothing . Whatever gas they used really did a number on me . Do you remember anything ? No . And without knowing the case , I have no idea what could be so important as to make an entire lab full of people disappear . I keep thinking about what the NSA said . What if this is about my mother ? Wouldn 't we remember that ? Well , but that 's that the thing . I don 't remember anything . It 's not even just a blur . It 's just not there . I know , but , you know , it 's kind of out of our hands , until we hear from " Mother . " You don 't talk about your mother much . Why is that ? What do you wanna know ? What was she like growing up ? She was , um ... She was difficult to read . I knew she loved me , but I could always sense the , uh , the pressure my condition gave her , you know , the strain . I 'd always wanna tell her not to worry , but I just wouldn 't know what to say to make things better , so I was frustrated a lot of the time . Well , how did you deal with it ? I just worked through those frustrations in other ways . Puzzles , thought experiments . Any problem that I could figure out the solution to . But that didn 't last long . After my dad left , my mom met a man named Bill , and they were crazy about each other . But , um , Bill and I ... we didn 't get along . And it was only a matter of time until Bill wanted me out of there , so he gave my mom a choice to send me away to school , or , you know , break up . God , Cameron , I had no idea . Honestly , it 's totally fine . Actually , it feels good to get that off my chest . Thank you for listening . Thanks for talking to me . ( gasps ) I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean it . No , no . I just think with everything going on , it 's probably ... the less touching , the better . Right . I don 't want to confuse things . You know , I should go to sleep . I 'm sure Camille won 't mind if you , uh , use her room . Wherever she is . Oh , blackout shades , score . Wake me if she gets home tonight ? Ha . If the sound of Camille kicking my ass out of her own bed isn 't alarm enough , I will . Good night . Night . Cameron ! - What is it ? - Someone is watching us . Ok . I just checked the porch . Long aside the house , out back ... I didn 't see anyone . I swear , I saw a woman standing right outside the window . She was looking in , and she ... Wait . Do you think the NSA sent someone to watch us ? Was that ... " Mother " ? No . Okay , I think this is the latest in a series of aftereffects from the knockout gas . You just need some rest . Our friends are missing , and I just saw someone peeping on us from outside . Yes , I know that , but you are very tired , and we are both very disoriented , so I think the best option right now is to get some rest , and come at this with a clear head in the morning . Okay ? Okay . Okay . Wait . If you don 't mind , could ... could you sleep in my room tonight ? Like on the floor ? - Are you awake ? - Hmm ? Barely . What 's up ? I can 't stop thinking about us . We 've done so much together , it seems like we should know everything there is to know about each other , but after hearing you talk about your mother before , I 'm not so sure about that . Speak for yourself . I think I know you pretty well . Oh . Oh , yeah ? What 's my favorite movie ? Mmm . ( chuckles ) Trick question . You don 't have one . Now , good night . Well , when I was in middle school , what sport did I play ? And why did I quit ? Basketball . Ed Clark wanted you to try out because he thought it would help you be a team player , and even though you never wanted to go , you didn 't quit . Until they kicked you off the team . Which was ridiculous because I was the best player . Maybe , but if the best player on the team suffers from temporal dysplasia and has no perception of time , you tend to get a lot of shot clock violations . Okay , I 'm really goin ' to sleep now . Okay , when I was a little girl , I broke a bone , and I never saw a doctor , because I was too embarrassed to tell anyone how I did it . Which bone did I break ? Right foot , please . Oh , my , gosh . This little piggy . You got so excited when you heard the ice cream truck comin ' down the street , you sprinted towards the door and stubbed it on a chair . I never told you that . How did you know that ? Cameron ? Cameron ? Cameron ? - Oh ! - Ooh ! Ooh . Oh . Ahh , sorry . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah . No , I 'm fine , I just ... I ... I woke up , and you weren 't in bed , you were gone , and I ... ( sighs ) I thought maybe ... You miss me ? I take it Camille didn 't come home ? No , I haven 't been able to get hold of anyone . - Nothing from the NSA ? - Nada . Okay , well , I don 't know about you , but I can 't sit on my hands much longer . Hello ? Okay , well , it doesn 't look like anyone 's been here since we left . And whose is that ? Is that the same coffee cup that was here yesterday ? No . It 's still hot . Someone made this recently . Okay , we 're being mucked with and I don 't like being mucked . - This doesn 't make any sense . - ( cup rattles ) What was that ? Hold on . ( rattling ) What the hell ? What 's " Euro " ? I have no idea . - Wait . - What ? There 's something in the static . - What is that ? - It looks like a face ? There 's another one . Is there any way to bring the image out of the static ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . I think I have an idea . I can rig something up . Great . How long will it take ? It 's a 30-minute job , I 'll be done in 10 . Okay , I 'll look around the lab and see if there 's anything else that 's ... been moved around or changed . Cameron ? I found something ! Cameron ? Cameron ? This is pretty cool , huh ? For a Deadmau5 show . Deadmau5 wishes he were this cool . All right , question for you . Why couldn 't we make out those images on the monitor ? They were too faint , and there was a static blizzard over them ? Well , that 's when they were under our boring old white lights . If we hit them with the right color light and frequency , we can make all those hidden images pop and send all that unwanted noise to the background . - Man of science . - Well ... - I don 't see anything . - A moment . Kirsten : Sad . Happy . Surprised . - Confused ... - These are for people with autism to understand emotions . I used to have flash cards just like this when I was a little girl with temporal dysplasia . Interesting . And they would be on our monitors because ... ? Maybe " Mother " is trying to send a message to us . What are you doing ? I saw something else . It was a shape of some kind , but it 's a different color . And the mucking continues . What is that doing in your hand ? What was this doing in your locker ? You think I had something to do with all of this ? At this point , I don 't know anything . What is a key doing in a coffee cup ? What is a face doing hidden in static on these monitors ? Kirsten , I don 't understand any of this , either , but I 've been by your side this whole time . You know me ! Hold this . Where are you going ? To finish the puzzle ? Should I get your stitch suit ? We 're all adults here . Puzzle piece ? So what does it mean ? - Why you askin ' me ? - You 're the kid that grew up doing puzzles and thought experiments . What does it mean ? Challenge accepted . ( laughs ) You gotta see this . Are you 12 years old ? I mean the puzzle , you perv . Oh . Good thinking , Goodkin . I thought so , too . - 5-9-1-5 . - Gelson Street . Maybe the answer to all of this is there . But what if it 's a trap ? Well , if it 's a trap , then that 's the answer , too . No one cars outside . No one inside the house . Okay , what are we supposed to find ? Well , I know that everything today is a riddle stuffed in an enigma , wrapped in a mystery , but I really can 't see anything in here worth investigating . I can think of one thing . One seriously badass vintage thing . Oh my gosh . Okay , it 's not a Hot Wheel . All right , don 't be so naive . Toys come in all shapes , sizes and prices . - So what kind of toy is this ? - This ? Oh , this , this is a ' 65 Falcon , and I used to be obsessed , and I mean obsessed with this car when I was a kid . But my mom always said it was too dangerous . So ... Hmm . You 're a car guy . Another Cameron factoid I did not know . Looks like it 's had some work done since its day , but I bet this thing still purrs like a Manx and roars like a lion . Oh my gosh , what I wouldn 't give to have a night on the town with her . Eww , to all of that . Hey , it 's too bad we don 't have a key . Can you imagine just you and me , rollin ' down Mulholland in this thing , wind in our hair , ( sputtering ) Actually , I think we do . Hmm ? Kirsten : It doesn 't say " Euro , " it says " Ford . " It 's so old the engraving 's been rubbed down . Okay , I 'm just gonna ignore how seriously weird this is , and just keep embracing how seriously awesome this is . Why , thank you . - Uh , what are you doing ? - Safety first . We 're not taking this car out for a spin . Huh ? Somebody led us , step by step , from the lab to this car , there must be a reason why . We gotta take a look around , and see if we can figure it out . Okay , okay . Huh . Any other day , that would be odd . There 's no registration or insurance . Maybe it 's inoperable . ( car starts ) ( chuckles ) So much for that theory . ( pop song playing over radio ) Why won 't it shut off ? It 's just got a faulty ignition switch . Try again . We need to get the garage door open . Okay . ( grunts ) It 's locked . Front door . - Let 's try this one . - ( coughing ) Here , let me try . Let me try . What the hell ? ( coughing ) - It 's locked from the outside . Damn it ! Okay , look for something heavy like a hammer or a hatchet , something that we can break down this door with ! Right . ( coughs ) God , this box is just full of puzzles . - Oh , my God , I 'm getting nauseous . - ( Kirsten coughs ) ( Cameron grunting ) ( grunts , coughs ) Here , let me try . - Let me try . - ( coughing ) - ( coughs ) - I got it , I got it , I got it . ( coughing ) ( grunts , coughs ) Cameron , I need your help . ( coughing ) ( wood splintering ) Cameron ? ( coughs ) Cameron , you all right ? Cameron ! - Okay , I just wanna sleep . - No ! You can do this . ( coughs ) You can do this . Look at me , you can do this . I know you . You can do this . Okay ? Come on . Come on . ( both panting ) Okay , ready ? Go ! ( grunting ) Okay , on the count of three , come on . - One . - Two . ( grunts ) - ( coughing ) - That is not how I thought my first time in classic car - would go . - How are you feeling ? I 'm a little better now that I 've had some fresh air . - How about you ? - Actually , I feel kind of the same way as I did when I woke up in the lab . That could be something . What do you think ? I think that our lungs are full of fumes from a car that probably hasn 't had an oil change in my lifetime , that we don 't know where our friends are , that we haven 't eaten anything beyond simple carbs in over 36 hours , and it 's been even longer since I showered . - ( sniffs ) - Mm . Yeah . Yeah , why don 't you go shower . I 'll make us some food . Any requests ? Surprise me ! Oh my gosh ! Kirsten ... Cameron ! That is not what I meant by " Surprise me " ! Look , I know things have been kind of confusing the last few days , for a lot of reasons , but , you know , they haven 't changed things between us . What are you talkin ' about ? I 'm still not ready for us to be together . Okay , now that you 've gotten that off your chest , can I tell you what I came here to tell you ? You know how we thought the garage was a dead end ? We were wrong . I can usually solve one of these things in under a minute , but not this one . - So you 've lost your touch ? - Hardly . Contrary to popular belief , these things are actually pretty easy to solve , if you know what patterns to look for . You got six sides , nine squares on each . So the only way to make this truly impossible to solve , is by deliberately switching one of the squares . Which is exactly what 's been done to this cube . It 's an unsolvable Rubik 's cube . Oh , yet another in a long stream of puzzles . I really wish someone would just tell us what 's going on . ( sighs ) You know , honestly ? Working out these clues with you over the last two days hasn 't been the worst time of my life . Missing friends and near-death experiences aside , of course ? ( laughs ) Yeah , of course , but ... I don 't know , I just feel like it 's been a while since we 've gotten to work this closely together , that 's all . Yeah . You 're right , it has been . I 've missed it . Oh my God , that 's it . - What ? What 's it ? - What if somebody 's deliberately pushing us together , just us ? By forcing us to rely on each other , we 'd have to get over our baggage and be a more effective team . So you think this is some sort of Tony Robbins-meets-Jigsaw operation put on by the NSA ? No , no , not the NSA . Can we actually get dinner to go ? Uh ... Looks like we were paid another visit from the Clue Fairy . Now he 's just messing with us . Or she . No . He . Who is the one person that we know whose tactics are this extreme , and who wants us to keep stitching ? My father . The NSA told us that " Mother " is looking out for us . I really think that 's our lead . Oh , was " Mother " looking out for us when we got trapped and nearly died in the garage ? We don 't even know if she exists or if she 's just some NSA stalling technique . But we do know Stinger , and this has his fingerprints all over it . Kirsten , this is not about Stinger . How can you be so sure ? You were the only one left when I bounced . Why weren 't you taken ? What are you talking about ? Are you and Maggie and the NSA doing this to get me to trust you again ? Work with you ? Forgive you ? Listen to yourself , you 're being ridiculous ! Why ? Because you say so ? Why should I trust you ? Because you know me . Do I ? This was a mistake . What ? This . This whole thing with you and me , it 's like my whole life , no matter how hard I try to make connections with people , it just ... it just never works out . Cameron , what are you talking about ? You 're one of the most outgoing people I know . You 've never had problems connecting with anyone . - Wait . - Huh ? Hold on , what if ... What if these monitors are puzzle pieces , like ... like they 're clues or something ? If we ... we rearranged these , we can ... Okay , I 'll help . Actually ... I just think we 'd do better working alone . Sure . Okay . Another clue ? Great . Okay . What is the last case we worked on ? Jake Rowland . Tell me something I don 't know . What is the current case we 're working on ? - Tom Dewitt . - Tom De-who ? Tom Dewitt . Severely autistic man in his 20s , found dead in his garage . Suicide . Car exhaust inhalation . He was also an empath . His brain was wired in a way that meant he could feel the depth of other people 's emotional states . I 'm confused . A new case came in ? No . Not a new case . Tom is our current case . - I thought that file was deleted . - Well , that 's what you said , but I didn 't have a chance to check for myself until now . Oh , so now you 're calling me a liar . No . I 'm saying that ... You 're not real . Okay , Kirsten . It 's been a long day , huh , maybe it 's time we call it ? No , no , no . You don 't understand . I 'm stitched into Tom right now . You 're right . I don 't understand because that is metaphysically impossible . If we are stitched into Tom right now , how have we spent the last two days traveling back and forth across the city ? Have we , though ? Because to me , it feels like we talk about going somewhere and then all of a sudden , we 're just ... there . Like jumping between different memories in a stitch . Do you remember actually traveling to the places we 've been ? - Yeah , of course I do . - Really ? So , what was the traffic like , and what was on the radio in the car ? See ? You can 't remember , because it didn 't actually happen ! How could Tom have this memory ? Just you and me , arguing on the floor , of a secret NSA facility ? That 's exactly what I 'm getting at . By stitching into Tom , we must 've opened up a pathway into his empath abilities . So , instead of objectively seeing his memories , I 'm experiencing them through a filter of ... my emotional state . Nothing that 's happened in the past two days has been real . Including me . Including you . You 're a reflection of my feelings about us . So I 'm your imaginary friend . No . No , no . You 're more like my projected friend . Wait here . Cameron ? - Now take this . - What ? No ! Take it ! - Cameron . - Now shoot me . Cameron . Stop it . What are you so worried about ? If I 'm a figment of your imagination ... - Yeah , I know , but ... - Do it . Pull the trigger . - No ! - Am I real or not ? - Stop ! - Am I real or not ? You 're not real ! But that doesn 't mean that I could watch something happen to even my projected version of you . I care about you . I never stopped caring about you , and even though I know this isn 't real , I can 't stand the thought of losing you and it being my fault . I guess that means you love me . ( gunshot ) Cameron ! God ! ( whimpers ) Cameron ? Talk to me . Oh ... God , no ! Oh my God . Oh . It 's a stitch ! I knew it , oh my God ! I knew it , it 's a stitch ! I 'm in a stitch ! Cameron ! I know I 'm stitched into Tom Dewitt ! Can you hear me ? I don 't know how I 've been in here for so long . But I ... I ... I think that something about Tom 's autistic brain pattern has me isolated in this stitch , so ... so , God ! I hope you can hear me , because I ... I can 't hear you . And I 'm ... And I 'm ... all alone in here . I 'm so sorry , Tom . Cameron ... I 'm gonna make the bounce . Jake . Coco Soo ? Jamie B ? I wanna speak for Tom , the same way I spoke for you all , but I ... I can 't do it alone . Yes , you can , Kirsten . Ed . Tom needs you . But I don 't understand how his mind works . His focus , his ... empathy . Well , you can 't give up . Not now . Tom is the most ... silent of us all . Nine squares . Nine monitors . Cameron ... I 'm not bouncing yet . I think I 've figured it out . The images on each monitor are all part of one big puzzle . They were deliberately separated , but if I arrange them just right , they might tell me something . So , Cameron , if this is all a stitch , then all the conversations we had weren 't really between us . Tom 's memories are clearly mixing with my emotional state . Anything that felt out of the ordinary coming from you , must 've been coming from Tom . Which means that the story you told me about your mom and her boyfriend Bill ... didn 't happen to you , it happened to Tom . The blackout curtains in Camille 's room , the way you didn 't wanna be touched when we were having dinner , how you felt like you had trouble connecting with people , all of that was a part of the way that Tom experienced life as an autistic man . And the puzzles . He was so overstimulated and ... overwhelmed , he needed them to focus , to feel like he had control . - ( popcorn popping ) - ( microwave dings ) Oh ! Heat sensitivity ... That 's Tom , too . So " Mother " must 've been Tom 's mother . He knew that she would always look after him . But who killed Tom ? Let 's see if I 'm right . Maybe I was wrong . Is that an eye ? Maybe it 's a face . Cameron ? I think it 's a face ! I know that face . I know that face ! ( beeping ) Cameron : Kirsten ! Fisher : Is she okay ? Kirsten , what happened ? I solved it ! It took days , but I solved it ! Congrats , Linus , you did it . What did I do ? You finally broke Kirsten . Okay . Bill Kurland killed Tom Dewitt . Uh ... this Bill Kurland , Tom 's mother 's boyfriend ? That 's the one . LAPD already questioned Kurland . He was at work at the time of death . That 's because , before he left for work , Bill locked Tom in the garage , and ... and started the engine to his old car . Are you sure Tom didn 't start the car himself ? Positive . His mom kept that key in an ... in an old coffee cup , specifically , so that nothing like this would ever happen . And Tom had a heat sensitivity . He 'd never touch a coffee cup , no matter what . Why didn 't he just leave the car or the garage ? Because he was obsessed with puzzles . Bill gave him a Rubik 's cube that had been tampered with so that he 'd be so focused on trying to solve it , he 'd asphyxiate without screaming or calling out . And even if he did come to , Bill locked the door from the outside . Okay , but why ? Because he was in love with Tom 's mom . But she was so devoted to Tom that it was destroying their relationship . By killing Tom , Bill thought that he was freeing his mother from the burden . - Fisher , go get Bill Kurland . - Yes , ma 'am . We did it , Tom . You and I , together . Thank you for talkin ' to me . Are you okay ? Yeah . ( sighs ) I 'm sorry , I ... You must 've been so worried about me that whole time . - Worried about what ? - Well , I was in the stitch for days . You weren 't afraid I wasn 't gonna bounce ? Kirsten , you were only in there for three seconds . ( sighs ) Well , I guess that was all the time I needed . For what ? For this .

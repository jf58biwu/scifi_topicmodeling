 We received some very unusual data , today . Military division ? Harbinger 1 Training Facility . Which model ? S.A.R. There 's been a reprogram count ... of one and a half million , just under one day . That is a high number . It 's unprecedented . Well , in that case , Mills ... congratulations . Drifter ? Report . The other are out on the strip . And it 's shitty . See you out there . Hey ! Winder ? What 's this all about ? I 'm not the guy you should be asking . We 've been on training the last four times out . It 's two days . They 're looking for marines with combat time . Not many of those left . I thought we were pushing to finish it . With drones . With more than enough men sitting it out ... You know no one is sitting it out , over there ... cause we are all here . Harbinger , right ? If it were me , I 'd take a look around ... think about the money , not where it 's coming from ... and get on the transport . Wait . You 've been assigned a Tech . Captain Bukes ? Katherine Mills . What do you want ? We have hardware in the field , where we would be testing . I 'm from Harbinger , I 'll be observing . Oh , yeah ? Keeping an eye on us . Yes , and the hardware . Are you trying to work out what you can save on ? No , no . That 's no what we do . We 're venders for the US military . We 're not the US military . If you don 't keep up , we 'll leave you where you pass out . And turn that shit off . I don 't want to be scanned at anytime , is that clear ? This , doesn 't go off . Captain ? We 're Oscar Mike , Mills . Fall in , or stay here . Is she with us ? Looks that way . How long do you think till we see one of them in uniform ? By then we won 't be . Here . See if you can understand it . Excuse me . We 're all back together . Corporal Loftus ? Mills . How the fuck did she even know my name ? Did you just look me up ? Fucking techer . Officer on deck . Nine letters down , " Brought to an end . " Go to sleep . How many more clicks ? Jeez , boy , what is it ? Hm ? You need to take a shit , or something ? Give me five seconds with this motherfucker . This is an exercise . We don 't know where we 're going . Even my wife doesn 't know where we 're going . I thought Cutbill was your wife . Oh , oh . You 'd like that . I do love my mute little war prince . Yes , ma 'am . It means a lot . Hey . Do you know my name ? Lance corporal Martin Goodwin . You do know your name is on your front ... don 't you , Goodwin ? But it don 't say the first name . Lance corporal Martin Goodwin . Address : 23T81 Center Street , Conway , Arkansas . Home with mother , Alice Goodwin . Father , Clint , deceased . Medical records indicated ... Would you like me to stop the children ... from bothering you , Mills ? Watch it , Sarge . You got to choose your friends carefully . This one might be able to find out how much porn ... you 're downloading . It would take more than one person to calculate that shit ... let me tell you . It 's " Concluded " . Thank you . Hey , Mills . I see you . I can also fire from here while you are checking the chamber . Alright . Check your field pads , move on these coordinates . Ammo 's live . Check your targets . Goodwin , you hear me ? Live ammo . Yes , sir . We will be monitored . Oscar Mike in five minutes . Let 's go . It 's show time ! Guess who 's getting the first robot ? What she 's got , is just another tool . Like these . Do those go into your brain ? Goodwin . Get that stuff out of the way . Yes , sir . Captain Bukes . Wait a moment , please . Welcome to Harbinger One Training Facility . Exercise is now on . Welcome to Harbinger One Training Facility . Exercise is now on . Sarge . Who 's monitoring us ? There 's no one here . I 'm watching you . You better bet there 's nobody here . Sir . What do you want us to do ? Let 's get on with it . We 're Oscar Mike . Sir ! Yes , sir . Captain , do you have ground support ? No . No unmanned ground recon , whatsoever ? Problem ? No , no , I just thought ... Good . I 'm sorry , Captain , I think we got off on the wrong foot . I don 't think so , Mills . Two days . This place 's got a serious decorating problem . Home , sweet home . Yo , Hackett . Yeah ? You decorated this place , right ? I took inspiration from your apartment , dipshit . Is this whole thing going to be inside ? Shut up and keep moving , Cherry . Alright . Cutbill , eyes up . Yes , sir . We 're here to train ... but , that doesn 't mean we should let our guard down . Eyes up . Robinson , walk and point . Goodwin , with me . Okay . Okay , spread out . No gaggle fuck , please , ladies . Let 's move ! Nothing up front . We 're all clear for about a click . Goodwin , hang in there for a second . Hackett , Loftus , Cutbill ... move wide , check the flanks . Drifter ? I got it . I understand you 're a Supertech , Mills . You don 't need to do all this humping shit . Help me out , with my boss . We 're all a bunch of cavemen , huh ? Not all of you , Sergeant . Good . I like that . I got your six . Whoa . Mills ? No , no , no , no . Wait a minute . This is Drifter . We picked up some surveillance . Same here . Someone 's got a new toy . Harbinger make this ? Yes . But this one 's been modified . It 's Quantum Robotics . There 's no operator . Quantum . One and naught , and everything in between . Yes , that 's right . I read . It doesn 't mean I understand what I am reading . It 's autonomous . All that power to get it to follow Goodwin 's dumbass ... through the forest . So , you high up in Harbinger ? Yes Can I get a job ? I just lost mine . I know . At least they know we 're here . Let 's keep moving . Mills , game time . Let 's go ! Take a look . What do we got this time ? What does it look like ? They look fucking ridiculous . Listen up . Nine robot targets , to the north ... close to the river , maybe more . Are you kidding me , man ? Let 's get this done , right ? Goodwin , Hackett , with me . Everyone else , on the ridge . We 're are gonna get some ... Goodwin , you just stay with me . Drifter . Yes , sir . Alright , everybody , switch on . Let 's move ! Mills ? Care to join me ? Ready . Ready . Set . Goodwin , you watch me . Yes , sir . Reaper 1 in position , standby . Firing in five . Five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... fire ! You getting all this ? You like that ? Look at you ... And that concludes our day . Well done , team . Let 's set up camp , dig a ditch , get in early . Where are you , Mills ? Man , I hope you keep your job . The world is no place for you . There 's no place for you , because they don 't fit you . Too damn big , Robinson . Too damn big , brother . Too damn big . So , I say " Where ? " " Where 's the target ? " He says , " Down there . " " Goodwin . " I 'm actually thinking , " Should I smoke the little fucker ? " Oh , we don 't want to shoot you , Cherry . We love you . If you don 't shave that ass hair off your face ... I might shoot you myself . Seriously , dude , get a razor . Is it true , you guys are really ... What ? You think she 's a fox ? Damn , you little pervert . I think she is ... interesting . She 's not even human , man . Alright . Five letters , " Most inferior " . Anybody ? Goodwin . That 's not five ! Yeah , but it is fucking true . Damn , did you see those things up close ? Honestly , they were rolling into each other . It 's embarrassing , man . I have seen more advance juicers . Mills . Coffee ? So ... where did you get to , today ? I had a look around . We still can 't reach anyone . You had any luck ? You know , with your ... The network here is local . There 's something blocking our transmissions ... but I don 't know what . I 'm trying to get to the bottom of it . Right . Why doesn 't Bukes ask me himself ? Bukes , he 's , uh ... he 's a little shy . Shy ? Yeah . Especially around cute girls . Or maybe he just chooses not to like you . With his record , that 's unfortunate for me . You pulled his file ? Drifter , I pulled everyone 's file . How many does it say ? It says eighteen . Just the figures , no context , right ? That 's why he doesn 't want to like you . Those figures may be hard to swallow , but that 's the job . And we are good at our jobs . So , how old were you when you were chipped ? I was eleven . Without it ? Paralysis . You have to wait until you are old enough . Harbinger sponsored that ? Yeah . Cured it . I thought I was institutionalized . You have no idea . You can keep staring , but it won 't make her disappear . Did she say anything to you ? She says we 're being blocked , that 's why there 's no comms . She doesn 't know why . She knows . I don 't think so . Incredibly , she really seems to be as clueless as us . All the gear ... no idea . Something 's off . With the training ? With Mills ? Both . Sir . Sir . What makes you so sure that she 's the problem ? I have never been cut off , before . Can 't reach anyone at TAC . Can 't reach home , at all . And there she is , with a radio in her head , saying nothing . What the hell do you want ? Get out of here ! What the fuck is going on , here ? I don 't know . Was that your weapon ? No . Then who the fuck is firing , man ? I don 't know , man . I just heard the firing . Loftus ! Alright , Cutbill , fall back . Goodwin , go with Loftus . Why do you keep asking me ? I told you , I don 't know ! What happened ? Sir , I looked up and saw Loftus stood right there ... and the next second he was gone . Well , this is just part of the training , right ? Loftus ! Loftus ? Loftus ! Loftus ! Loftus ? I see him . Over there ! Robinson , Hackett , follow me ! Slow down , Cutbill ! Slow down ! Loftus ? It 's him . What is this ? Can you hear me , buddy ? Sam ? Alright , move back . Sergeant , what the hell is going on , here ? Sam ? What is going on , here ? Shut up ! Cutbill ! Sam , talk to me . Enough ! Come on , man . Think that 's gonna help him ? Look at me . Shut up . Should we take it off ? Those lines , they 're ... Those cuts are straight . It 's like ... Captain , let 's get out of here . Help me with him . No , let 's get out of here . Help me with him ! Cutbill , shut up ! Mills , what 's going on ? This is your target area , from yesterday . What ? Sir , we got to get him out of here as soon ... Move ! Move ! Mills ? Those were our positions . Robinson , cover me ! Keep moving ! Captain , do you copy , over ? We got to get somewhere , where we can get eyes on . I can 't get a good shot , from here . Captain ? Captain , do you read me ? Copy . Anyone , this is Cutbill , do you read me ? Let me go ... let me go . Let me go . Let me go . Let me go . Let me go ! Let me go . Please , don 't ! What the fuck is this ? Please don 't ! Did you see them ? Not clearly . I saw a couple of them , took a shot . They must have pretty good armor , cause I hit them hard . Like the ones from yesterday ? No , they 're bigger . They 're our height . My Marines are dying , so , you tell me what you know . You saw them on that ridge . I 'm connected to the network , so , I see them , yes . You do see them . Yes . So , turn the fucking things off , right now . I can 't . You can 't ? Well , you don 't seem to have a problem ... turning everything else on and off . I can 't just turn them off . There 'd be a reason . Programming errors . I 'm running the possibilities . Look , this is not a fucking equation . You just get a hold of some one , right now ... you get us out of here ... Okay . or , you 're going to be ... Not like this . the next one getting shot . She doesn 't know , alright ? Some programmer screwed up , somewhere . No , no . Screw ups aren 't so efficient . I can 't find him . But I found this . Not too far from here . We need to find him , sir . Goodwin , you got rear point . Okay , I 'm listening . She 's useful . We can 't see them on the field pads ... we can 't see them through the trees ... but , Mills sees them . Does it occur to you that if she sees them ... and they see her , and us ... It doesn 't matter . It doesn 't matter ? No . 'Cause I 'm telling your right now ... we need all the help that we can get . Did you see the groupings on Hackett ? They hit her 3 times . The third time while she was spinning through the fucking air . I 've been thinking about that ... 'cause that 's all that I 'm thinking about . They had us . And they let us walk . Why ? Let us walk ? What about Cutbill ? Now , they could have finished everyone of us . But , while she was there , they held back . It 's not about her . Or you . Bukes ? The used them for target practice . Like Loftus . We 're being track from the ridge . Move ! Hold on . Where 's Bukes ? I lost track of him . This is Drifter , anyone copy ? Come on . Let 's keep moving . Goodwin ! Move ! Bukes , come in , copy . Solid copy , Drifter . Who 's with you ? I got Goodwin and Robinson . We are north , about a click from the camp . Good . Mills is down ... but I found a place to hole up . We 'll come find you . No . You won 't find your way through the dark . They 'll have no problem picking you off . Stay put . We 'll regroup as soon as the light 's better . Over . Bukes , copy . Copy . We need her . Copy . See you tomorrow . Over . How long was I out ? Nine hours . Drink this . Why didn 't you leave me ? I don 't know . I 'm still thinking about it . While you were out of it ... one of those machines shows up here and , uh ... the two of you had a moment , or something . We need to find it . Why ? I can 't explain it . Find a way . Let 's go . It 's good to see you , man . You too . Everyone in one piece ? Yeah . They didn 't try for us . They could have . As far as I can make out , they were everywhere last night . Mills ? Yeah , it 's clear ahead . All their signals are behind us . Let 's get back to the drop zone ... and wait till someone sends us a transport . Let 's be ready , this time . Stay low , Mills . He 'll need me for the door . I 'll be fine . Bukes ? Take Mills to the door . We need her to get in . Alright . Copy . Take it easy down there , Mills . We need your eyes . Clear . Come on . Do you want me to handle this ? Wait here . Captain Damien Bukes . Wait a moment , please . Wait a moment , please . Wait a moment , please . Surveillance drones . Mills . Get the door . Okay . Come on , come on . What happens if they can 't get through the door ? Smoke . They 're using smoke . They 're fucking copying us ? Drifter ? I can 't see a thing . Goodwin ? Move ! Robinson , move , move ! Got it . Drifter , the door is open . Get him out of here , now ! Come on , come on ! Come on ! Drifter , let 's go ! Drifter ! No ! Drifter ! Don 't let it cut me up ! Bukes , I can stop this ! Wait ! Damn it , Robinson ! Don 't let it cut me up ! Do it ! No wait ! No ! No ! Let 's go , Mills . Now ! I could have saved him . No one could have saved him . Yes , I could . I could have saved him . No way ... Why didn 't you wait ? I was telling you to wait . There 's no way ... I could have saved him . Yes , I ... I made them ! This shit don 't make no sense . Why are we here , Mills ? I don 't know . Marines come here to train . I don 't know why you 're here ... I only know that you were requested . And you ? Why are you here ? I write the program , design the prototypes . This is where they are tested . Have you had a good look at what you 've done ? What you 've created ? Nothing like this has ever happened before . The code has advanced more than we ever could have imagined . But , if I can understand it , I can try to control it . It 's a little late for that , don 't you think ? No , you don 't understand . Open your eyes , Mills . They 're killers . That 's all they are . She stood in the middle of that road ... and not one of them took a shoot . That 's because they are trying to work out ... if I 'm one of them , or not . Yeah ... so were we . What are they ? They 're your replacements . Replacements ? They 're called S.A.R. Study , Analyze , Reprogram . They learn . Given enough to learn from , then , they improve themselves . Like us . We created them to save lives , and they will . Whose lives are they going to save ? Cutbill 's ? Loftus ' ? Hackett , Drifter ? We built them so people like you ... don 't have to die , or kill anyone . That 's not up to you . It 's up to me . And how has that worked out , so far ? I live with it ... so people like you won 't have to . But you 've killed us . And you know it . Watch her . Half an hour , and they 'll roll us out the back . Do we fight them off here , and wait for the transport ? We won 't last that long . We need to find a better defensive position . There 's another door . Well , that would be you , Mills . Wait a second . How do we know this door doesn 't just lead right back outside ? Do you want to stay here , Goodwin ? We don 't have a choice . Open it . I can 't see a thing . Motherfucker . Did you turn the lights on ? Don 't turn anything else on . Are you alright ? No , man . I fucking hate this place . This is where they test them ? Unbelievable . You should have stopped when you made these . Lock the door . Open this one . Goodwin , keep with us . Copy . Mills , you have to stay with me . Mills ! Well , this just gets better and better . I can 't communicate out , even from in here . It 's a bottleneck . We can slow them down from here . Charges ? Yeah . Goodwin . How many have we got ? We got about five . Five . Yeah . That 's all we got , Cap . What 's you scanning for ? Captain ! Mills ? Mills ! Mills ? Whatever you 're thinking ... They have power . I 'm going to activate one . They share information . That 's why they are so well organize . When it comes online , I 'll know everything they know . I can get to them , through this one . Are you fully operational ? Command to Speech mode . Speech mode activated . What are S.A.R. general orders ? Running human combat program . Study , Analyze , Reprogram . Okay . Come on . Unable to comply . There is an human error . Detail human error . Human training subjects not performing as expected . Subjects require motivation . Training now with live ammunition ... and to new human training subjects . Error . Unable to identify your current configuration . Please standby . Error . Mills , AE-3583 . You have failed clearance . Error . Mills , AE-3583 . Access is denied . My God . Did Guardian S.A.R. unit order Reaper 5 unit into training ? Did you bring these marines here ? Yes . When will the training program be complete ? Completion unspecified . Mills , open the door now ! No , I have to try . Come on . Come on ! Access is denied . Error ... error . Remain stationary . Command S.A.R. unit approaching for further analysis . Remain stationary . Mills , open the goddamn door . No , no , leave me , the others are coming through . Open the door , Mills ! No , it 's too late ! They 're coming in , Captain . We got to move ! Not yet . Goodwin ! I 'm sorry , I had to try . Do you think we got him ? One . Maybe . Jesus ! Anyone have any idea where we are ? Anybody ? Any idea at all ? Mills ... how long have we got ? I don 't see them , they moved away . Good . Looks like some kind of training . Looks like ... they ran out of these . They moved over to the real thing . One . Two . That 's all . Last one . Great . If you need me , I 'll be in my office . Let me go . Let me go . Don 't let it cut me up ! You ready , Cherry ? Me neither . You see any , yet ? No . Are we moving ? No . So , this is it . What is that ? It 's an EMP . When you hit that S.A.R. in the tunnel ... it detonated one of them . It sends out a pulse that wipes anything with a current , near by . We put them in each of them ... so the enemy can 't steal our technology ... but , it 's range is short . I 've amped this one up . All we need now is a detonator . There is a leader , the one who 's responsible for all this . The S.A.R. codes are expanding in that one . That 's the one I need to be with , when I detonate . I think that will stop it , before it goes any further . Do you know why they haven 't killed us yet , Bukes ? Because they 've been pushing us ... here . They 'll give you enough time to set up ... and then they will come for you . But maybe I can end this . By killing yourself ? Even if you survive the blast , it will wipe you clean . At this point , we have no other option . I 'll have a small amount of time , and then , my chip will shut down . You can deal with whatever 's left . No . Do you understand what I 've done ? Look at this place . We can 't win this . Hey , Robinson ? What 's up , son ? Maybe you 're right . Maybe I 'm not cut out for this . You just figured that out now , Goodwin ? Robinson ... multiple markers to the south . Copy that . Draw them in . Goodwin , we 've got eyes on us . Stay out of sight , over . Copy that . How many ? All of them . Goodwin , they are in the streets , east and west . Standby . Please , God . Please , God . Goodwin , hit it . They lost a few . I got something ... Robinson , two 've broken free from the main group ... coming in fast . That 's one more down . ( Inaudible ) way from the west . I 've got him . I 'm going to fire . Goodwin , keep your head down . Robinson , on me . Robinson ! That 's another one . Bukes , there 's one right on you . Goodwin , hit south . Mills , where are the rest of them ? Goodwin , they see you . Captain , I just got made ! I got to move ! Robinson ? Cover me . Goodwin , don 't bail . Captain ? Captain ! Shit ! Get it off me ! Get it the fuck off me ! Captain ... the detonator . I dropped the detonator . Bukes , get behind me . I don 't know how long this is going to work . You can 't be here , Mills . You got to go . Just run . No , this is it . Hang in there , Mills . Go ! Move , move ! Robinson . Robinson ? Well , come on . Well , come on ! You wanted this ! Just fucking do it . I have received my orders . Come on , finish it ! More data is required . Mills ? Mills ! More data is required to complete training combat program . You are not identified . You are not identified . Identify . Identify . Human . Mills ? Hey ! We 're getting out of here .

 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... You and Mack have that secret to keep under wraps . This again ? Oh , and now Mack 's in on it ? I 'm just wondering if it means you 're - bringing Hunter in on the other thing ? - No . I shouldn 't have to ask any of you to save one of our own . - You never ask . - That 's enough ! You survived the destruction because you caused it . And I 'm pretty sure the DNA results we 're running right now are gonna confirm it . There 's something wrong with you . Her DNA is an exact match to what it was before . She 's clear . What did you just do ? I switched your blood results with your old samples . The new samples are different ? Drastically . For now we should just keep it between us . There is something very wrong with me . Kava . I must find Kava . Sorry , I don 't know who that is . You guys ? Hey ! A pretty lady like you shouldn 't be out here all alone . I can help you find Kava . I can help you with anything else that you need . Lady , who the hell are you ? I do not know . Not bad . But once I 'm pinned , you should try for a finishing blow . You want full Mortal Kombat ? I want you to stop holding back , Skye . I didn 't wanna hurt you . I didn 't wanna try to hurt you . I feel like I 'm constantly on the verge of ... - I don 't know . - Look , we lost Trip , and it hurts like hell . But you can 't shut those feelings out . Can 't sustain that . Well , what 's my option ? I just lose it right here ? We 've talked about this . Control . Embrace your emotions , your nerves . Use them . On your terms . I don 't know . What I 'm feeling is pretty dark . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna go postal and tear your head off . Go for it . I promise you won 't . Maybe Skye needs a break . Training is not a group activity . Yeah . I just came down to have ... Uh , see what it 's about . I 'll tell you what , Fitz . Come back in an hour . I 'd be happy to show you what it 's all about . I 'm fine , Fitz . Really . It would be pretty funny to see you and Fitz go at ... Okay , I guess we 're back on . And not holding back . Oh , my God . Water . So , Coulson called me into his office the other day . Hmm . Thought he was gonna read me the riot act . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s rules about fraternizing with fellow operatives . They 're strict . But he made me an offer . Wants to make my position here permanent . He 's short-handed now . You thinking about it ? Well , I wasn 't thinking of leaving anytime soon . And I wouldn 't mind taking on some more responsibility . Responsibility ? Did you hear the words that just came out of your mouth ? Yeah , that sounded a bit strange , didn 't it ? Yeah , who is that guy ? I don 't know . But I do not trust him . Anyhow , can 't hurt . Plus , this is fun . Well , fun was never a problem for us . No , you 're right . That part was always easy . Till things go south . Yeah , then you turn into a bit of a nightmare . I remember it well . You tell me . Seems the thing that always came between us was your dedication to S.H.I.E.L.D. Now we 're on the same team . It 's simpler . The last Stark Copper Jackets . I 'll make sure Hill puts ' em on the list . Anything else ? Sir , I can handle inventory myself . You know , I hope this isn 't about my reaction after ... No , I told you , we 're fine . After Puerto Rico , we need to take stock . What happened out there was ... Yeah , I don 't like thinking about that . I don 't blame you . But I have been thinking about it . And I realize I 've been wasting your talents . Sir ? Look , I know you love it under the hood of a car , but I could really use you out in the field . You 're a force to be reckoned with , Mack . Believe me . Okay , but violence isn 't really my thing . You know , that alien crap made me into something I 'm not . I know . But have you seen yourself ? You 're a little bit of a beast all the time . A blue dot operative in Portugal phoned in . You should hear what he has to say . Looks like you 're starting now . Oh , you 'll want everyone on the bus for this . Thank you for watching her . I hear from the Prime Minister 's office I 'm to hold this crazy lady here for you , I hold this crazy lady . How did you subdue her and get her to wait ? No subduing . She stayed willingly once I told her I 'd found Kava and he was on his way to meet her . Oh . But I 'm not Kava . I 'm glad I 'm not the one who has to tell her that . Pick up her sword from booking before you go . So you are not Kava . No , but I 'm a friend . Son of Coul . See ? We 've worked together before . I apologize . I do not remember . You have no memory of who you are ? I ... I know I am from Asgard . But I do not remember my home there . You tell me my name is Lady Sif , but why I left Asgard , what brought me here to Midgard , why I wear these hides instead of armor , a mystery . One I 'll help you solve . I 'm sure a clue will turn up somewhere . Twitter . Skye found it . That 's me . I don 't remember this . I 'm a decent fighter . This guy can hold his own against you . Impressive . Last time you were here you came to collect a rogue Asgardian . That would explain his strength . Regardless , she traveled across the universe to find him . He 's dangerous . Make that more than dangerous . We know you were after him . Question is , what 's he after ? Take me to your supplies . Powering elements . Fuel . Do not try and fight me . Someone on your world has changed . I 'm here to hunt them down . What do you want from me ? Don 't worry . You won 't remember . We found a couple of other videos of the fight , and we 've been analyzing them frame by frame , which ... Which didn 't get us much in the way of , um ... Of anything new . Yeah , thanks . Um , until we get to here . I do very much enjoy that part . So he 's wearing something mechanical . And she nailed it . And there 's more . What is that ? - Blood ? - I hope so . It could give us a lead . Well , there 's no way to know from the video . Once we land , Fitz , you go with Hunter and Mack , handle forensics . I need you and Bobbi to talk to witnesses in the area , see if we can track down where this guy went . Sir , the science division has loaded the team with heavier suppression artillery . After Raina 's vanishing act , we advise that when you find this man , you contain him first , ask questions later . New ICERs are still in development . Very good . Keep me posted . New ICERs ? Oh . The mechanical design is still top-notch . But we 're looking into a more concentrated dendrotoxin formula . And wouldn 't that be dangerous ? But effective . Given these elevated threats , we can 't risk it not being . My mind is that of a lost adolescent . I can provide no information of value . Not totally true . Judging by your clothes , we know you were undercover . Probably something you learned after your last visit here . Your usual full-armor look is a little more conspicuous . So you 're saying I wear that armor most of the time ? Mmm-hmm . Does this mean I 'm a warrior ? A good one . A great warrior . It 's just details that you 're missing . You must remember things about your home world , right ? Only basic lessons a child would learn . The name of your sword ? What about Thor ? Um ... I do not know this word . Yet , when you say it , I want to smile . Why ? Who can explain the mysteries of the Asgardian brain ? I can . I can 't see any blood . Fitz , isn 't there some special light that finds blood ? Not blood . What 's up , Magnum P.I. ? You enjoying this ? Who doesn 't like a good mystery ? I guess we 're both embracing new challenges . That mean you 're taking the permanent position that Coulson offered ? He 's a man down . I know you have your reservations , but I like the guy . Don 't you wanna see how this plays out ? Hmm . Hmm . - What 's that ? - I don 't know . This is about where the big guy was standing when Sif nailed him with the sword , right ? - Yeah . - Look at this . Oh ! I barely touched it , I swear . Trust me , there is no universe in which I think you did that on your own . Turbo , what do you think ? - Simmons . - Yes , Fitz . We 're uploading some information to you . Whatever came out of that guy 's chest , - I 'm guessing it wasn 't blood . - I 'll give it a look . See ? Who doesn 't like a good mystery ? You speak Portuguese ? I 'm no expert . It 's a pretty language . It 's hard to gauge if someone 's lying . Are you an expert at that ? At lying or telling if someone 's lying ? I have a feeling you 're probably an expert at both . Can I help you ? Hi . Yes . We 're looking for anyone who may have been injured in the incident at the pier , or may have seen this man . Mmm . No , he does not look familiar to me . As far as the injuries , I can ask around . The nurse who was working earlier took ill , so we are short-staffed . It may take a while . Okay . Well , we 'll be here . Wait . Is that woman all right ? What happened to her ? Yet you do not serve a king ? Not really how it works with us . I wonder if I serve the king , as the great warrior you say I am . Odin ? Oh , we know you do . You 've met him . Shut up . It 's her ! I was just conducting my interview with Mr. Cardozo here , asking him what he saw the other day , when ... You are a dangerous monster . I am no monster . I am sometimes dangerous , but only toward those who are deserving . I do not actually know . Is it only toward those who are ... No , that was right . Excellent . Answer his question , elderly man . Look , just tell us what you saw after they fought . The man destroyed my booth ! What does he want with balloons ? He went for my helium , broke off the valve and took them ! What does he need those for ? Sir , the boys were right . That definitely wasn 't blood . What are we talking about ? It was liquid nitrogen . The post was frozen solid and cracked . He must have been carrying a supply , and Sif must have damaged his containment hardware . So that 's what he needed the tank valves for . To repair it . Why carry nitrogen ? Might 've needed it for fuel . Might have needed it for a weapon . If he 's alien , he might need it to breathe . Not to breathe . Only seven intelligent species across the known realms require heightened levels of nitrogen gas , none humanoid . I learned this as a child , did you not ? Bobbi . Anything ? Sir , we have evidence he 's here at the hospital . It 's a big place , though . He might be hiding anywhere . Well , we know he needs nitrogen . And they use it in hospitals to power surgical equipment . I 'd start there . You do not wanna fight me . We just have some questions for you . Simmons is tending to Bobbi . She 's gonna be okay . The guy was blue . Like he-just-tested - some-Willy-Wonka-gum blue , and he needed nitrogen for whatever device turned its skin pink . Do you think he 's a Kree ? You told me last year the Kree had not visited our realm . If a Kree came to your world unannounced now , I would assume he 's up to no good . He attacked Bobbi and Skye , so that 's a yes . Yeah , the guy throws a mean punch . Let 's assume you were here to stop him . We still don 't know his objective . No , but knowing he is Kree helps . Kava , for example . I thought it was a name . It is a Kree word . You also learn other species entire languages as a child ? - Kava means " keys . " - Keys ? A device used to unlock ... Yeah , I know keys . It 's something . Let 's look into it . Skye , thank you for engaging my enemy . You are quite brave . The whole room was shaking , Fitz . The gun in my hand exploded . Oh , God . I thought that I could handle it , but I can 't . It 's too much . I think we have to tell Coulson what 's happening . Hang on . Wait . Just wait until I 've or ... Analyzed ... I can 't control it when I get upset , or nervous . I 'm running that diagnostic on your blood samples right now . Hopefully when it 's done , we 'll have a solution . Then there 's nothing you ... Sorry to interrupt whatever this is . Just wanted to check out the new toys from sci-tech . Okay . I 'm gonna scour the web for " key " references . Yeah , you do that . You , Ms. Morse , will live . That 's a relief . I 'll get you some antibiotic cream so we can keep you nice and uninfected . - Stay here . - Thanks . There goes your modeling career . You should talk , pretty boy . - You talk to Hunter ? - I did . He 's thinking about sticking around . I heard . I think it 's good . Things are good . Maybe we should bring him on board . No chance . That ship has sailed . Besides the fact that you two have a pattern that repeats itself , you didn 't tell him in the first place because you didn 't want him to know that you 've been lying to him . Trust has never been our strong suit . And we 're building something real here . I know he thinks so , but how 's he gonna feel if you tell him now ? Well , you can 't risk it . He 'll react badly , and it could blow up in our face in a big way . You can 't bring him in on this , Bobbi . What am I supposed to do ? I can 't bring him in ... I don 't want him here in case he takes their side . He 's a friend . I don 't want him fighting against us . He would never . Oh . He loves you , and he probably will always love you , but I still think he might be capable of killing you . You 're telling me to push him away ? I 'm saying it 's the only way you 'll ever have a chance to be together , to make it work someday . You remember what it felt like when our friends turned out to be HYDRA . We 're not HYDRA . You remember how it felt . The best thing would be if he decided to leave . And he wasn 't anywhere near here when we pull the trigger on this thing . And maybe there 's a world where we 're all friends in the end . I 'm saying I can 't find any particular keys that would be hugely important . Not literal keys , not metaphorical keys , not as in to the city . - It doesn 't mean that ... - Wait . Look at this . " Chaves . A city known for its sedimentary basins . " I don 't ... Guess what " Chaves " means in English . Let me guess . " Keys . " That 's where the Kree was heading . That 's where I was chasing him . That was my mission . But Chaves , Portugal , we 've seen that name before . It was in Whitehall 's SSR file . The site of his dig back in 1945 , where he first found the Obelisk . That 's where we have to go . Director ? I 'd like to sit this one out , please . You all right ? Yeah , just after my run-in with Blue Man Group , I still feel a little banged up , and I 'm just worried I 'm not gonna be much help out there . So ... Okay . Whenever you 're ready . Is it really about being hurt ? Or is it about your nerves ? I promise , it 's just about the guy making me see cartoon birdies all around my head . That 's it . Have Simmons give you one more check while we 're gone . Let 's make sure there 's nothing serious . Okay . Pull up the SSR file . I wanna pinpoint exactly where this Kree guy 's going . Stay right there . Put your hands up . You will not stop me . Wanna bet ? I am here to help . Is that why you attacked me , Kree ? You were the one who attacked . I had to take your memory to keep you from tracking me . How did you track me ? You do not ask the questions , Kree . You do not talk . Actually , we need him to talk . Look , I can prove that I 'm not a threat , and that I 'm here to help . Bring me my truncheon . How very Kree . He needs a weapon to make a point . My truncheon can restore her memory . Would that not be a gesture of my noble intentions ? I 'll consider it once we know that thing does what you say it does . Do you have a name ? Vin-Tak . And I will earn your trust . Simmons left you with truncheon duty ? Funny word , " Truncheon . " She wanted to take more precautions before investigating it . But I figured there 's certainly more to it than meets the eye . Been saying the same about you for years . Supposedly the Kree used this to wipe Lady Sif 's memory . There 's a dial on the bottom , but none of our equipment can detect any electrical or spectrographic signals . Is that your fancy way of saying you don 't know how to turn it on ? Or if it can . Well , I know something else we could try turning on . Hey , careful with that . You don 't wanna erase my hard drive , do you ? Like I said , it doesn 't seem to be working . All right , then . Well , maybe I can help you with it . The sooner we get it done , the sooner we can ... How are you gonna help me ? Can I just get a little space , please ? Ah . There she is . I need time figuring this out . Well , it seems like you already have . Not at all . I just think that we should slow things down a little bit . Yeah , okay , I get it . Just a bit of fun , yeah ? Though usually things get a little more heated before you turn frosty . Okay , sweetheart . Consider us slowed . Don 't die out there , yeah ? Hey , Hunter . It 's possible that only he can operate it . We 've seen other alien materials react to biology or DNA . - Don 't remind me . - Or me . We 've all been there , done that . Fitz and Simmons will examine the case . If this guy 's telling the truth , we might finally get the answers we 've been searching for . Tell us how the truncheon works , Kree . The Kree has a name . And that only works when in my hand . Hmm , that 's convenient . It has a dial on the bottom . Hey ! Oh . Sorry . The argument was going nowhere . You back with us ? Yes , my memories have returned . I am Lady Sif ofAsgard . Friend of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Asgardian . Well , that explains a lot . It is true , we do not trust Kree . That is why I am here . When Heimdall saw that one landed on your world , Odin charged me with retrieving him . So you came to pick a fight ? We know enough about Kree history to be concerned . Well , then if you know Kree history , perhaps you 've heard the tale of Terrigenesis . Of course . Ancient Kree descending on planets , altering the inhabitants to fight their war . And Earth was one of them . " Blue angels who fell from the sky . " Eons ago , the Kree waged a very long war . The casualties were high and they needed more soldiers . You mean cannon fodder . We needed killers . One vicious faction among the Kree genetically modified other creatures ' DNA . These modifications can be activated with Terrigen Crystals . We know these torturous experiments failed . Not on Earth . Here , we had to shut them down . This faction had built a city . They brought with them the Diviners , which hold the crystals . Their plans were discovered and thwarted by the better of my kind , putting an end to that dark chapter of our past . Until now . When I saw that an ancient signal had been triggered , I knew it had to be a Diviner . If the Kree Empire learned that these experiments were a success , they would be likely to renew them . Why did you come here ? These transformed beings are abominations . I knew that I had to find the remainder of the Diviners before another monstrosity occurred , and erase any knowledge of it . How many Diviners are supposed to be in that crate ? Enough to create an army . Sir , the crate is empty . My worst fear has come true . We have to assume they were all taken at the same time back in the ' 40s . Does that mean HYDRA has them ? And if HYDRA doesn 't , who does ? Fitz , what is this ? That 's nothing . It 's just , uh ... It 's remarkable . Extra macromolecules , just like in Raina 's blood . But different ones . Whose DNA is this ? It 's a simulation that I created . Or a theory of a ... A simulation ? Fitz , this is uncanny . - Can I have it back , please ? - The precision , the detail , it reads as real . Yeah , it 's just a simulation . We must find the remaining Diviners as well as anyone who 's transformed . We drowned the temple where the Diviners are activated , so that 's a plus . And we do know the woman who was changed . So someone was transformed . A Kree slave warrior created . Have you put it down ? No , she disappeared . What do you know of her ? We don 't know much about Raina 's transformation . Skye witnessed it , but didn 't see much . You were there ? What did you see ? I didn 't . I mean , nothing . Were there others with you ? The changes may not be on the surface , but buried inside . You must understand , these creatures are weapons . Abominations . Even if they don 't know it . Another one ? Son of Coul , what is this ? Skye ? You wanna talk to us ? Skye , what 's doing this ? I am . Don 't ! Hand her over . I will take her to Asgard . It will be safer for all of you . We will do no such thing . The weapon has been activated . It needs to be eliminated before it hurts someone . Skye is not a weapon . Coulson , no one is saying Skye chose this . But she is dangerous . I don 't wanna be this way . Imagine what will happen if your powers grow . It may not stop at breaking glass . You could bring down buildings . Tear continents apart . I can get a handle on it . That 's not what you were designed for . You were designed to destroy . Which is why you must be put down . Yeah , well , that sounds an awful lot like killing to me . - This is not your concern . - Skye , let 's go ! Fitz , we need Bambino ! You want her ? You go through me . What 's going on ? Jemma , I 'm so sorry . You knew . Lady Sif and the Kree are trying to take Skye away . Sif , you 've got your memory back . You know we 're friends . Consider what you 're doing . This is for the protection of your people . Enough ! Your friend Skye is an atrocity . And I must go put an end to this . We 'll decide what she is . But for now , you 're not going anywhere . This is not your fight . Kind of is now . Maybe we should call in some real back-up . This is twice now , you and me . You must really love fighting . Love fighting ? No . But you 're coming after one of my people . So I 'm willing to fight . That 's noble . Stupid , but noble . Hey , listen to me . Just me . We can do this . You can do this . I can 't ! I can 't make it stop . You will control your emotions , just like we practiced . I can 't make it stop . Everyone is at risk . Just focus . Skye , look at me . Focus . It 'll stop . Agent May , release the girl . You knew you couldn 't stop me . So what was the point ? Just wanted the attention . May , she 'll get through ! Ignore it . Remember , focus . I can 't . Skye . She harmed herself . Even though she knew it meant giving up her freedom . All to save the rest of you . Don 't you see ? She wants to get better . If you take her away from the people she loves , she 'll only get worse . I know you think I overreacted . But this decision , leaving Skye with you , it carries real danger . I want you to understand that . I do . But we 'll help her through it . Have we arrived yet ? This does not seem familiar . No , this is not your home planet . Lady Sif will take you from here . I apologize for my forgetfulness . You have been very kind . Why is my hand not blue ? You are in disguise from the people pursuing you . Remember ? Right . I will keep watch . I 'll return him to his home planet , Hala . He 'll remember none of this . No more trouble should come from there . - But here ... - Yes , there are other Diviners , but we flooded the city so no one can activate them . We 'll take every precaution . Coulson , your people make decisions based on logic . Usually . Usually . As do mine . Leaving Skye with us is the logical choice , I promise . No , no , that is not what I mean . Asgard is millennia beyond you in our pursuit of science , of knowledge . And we have learned , there are some things that can never be understood . Is this little talk one of ' em ? I know you wish to affect the outcome , but it may be ... It may be beyond that . Are you talking about fate ? I am saying there are tides in the universe that you cannot swim against . Best of luck , Son of Coul . Thank you . Heimdall , open the Bifrost . Not a lot of laughs , that one . And when I say that about somebody ... You agree with her . You think Skye 's more than we can handle . Look , most of the time , I believe what I see . You know that . But ... But ? You died . You were brought back . With a map to a city encoded in your DNA . Our team 's first mission ? We picked up Skye . Last week , we took her to that city . I can 't help but remember what Lumley said . Wherever Skye goes ... Death follows . Jemma , um ... I know you feel that I could 've been a bit more forthright ... Forthright ? Fitz , as understatements go , I think that qualifies as an instant classic . You lied to me . Okay , so now we 're even . Could you blame me ? The way you were going on about Raina , that she 's a plague to be eradicated ? I mean ... Skye is my friend . She 's different . Oh , yeah , like I was your friend . And then I changed . How did you handle that ? The point is , secrets don 't help any of us . Skye should 've just come clean . What ? And risk being locked up ? Studied ? Or who knows what else ? - No , I wouldn 't let her . - Oh , you wouldn 't let her ? We could 've handled her in a way that would 've kept everyone safe . It wasn 't fair to us , Fitz . We had a right to know . A right to know ? Is that the same way that Sif and the Kree had a right to know ? I think this situation 's a little bit different , mate . No , you would 've done to her exactly what they wanted to . You don 't know that . Yes , I do know that ! They would ... You ... You 'd handle her , Mack just said it , like Skye 's something to be locked away in a cage somewhere . We should be protecting her . No , Fitz . We 're the ones that need protection from her . Skye . Let 's talk . Hey . What 's going on ? You and Bobbi . What 's up ? I don 't know what you 're talking ... No , I know you 're keeping something from me . I don 't know what it is , but here 's what I do know . I know about the flash drive . I know Coulson doesn 't know about it , but I bet he 'd like to . I know there 's no support group . Hunter , listen ... No , Mack , don 't . Who 's back-up ? Bobbi mentioned it to you in the hallway . Who is back-up ? Okay . Well , that 's ... Damn it .

( BUTTONS BEEPING ) ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) ( DINGING ) Um , we 're operating under a grant from Werner-Goss Biotechnical , so you 're gonna need to sign a confidentiality agreement . Uh , Niko , this is Eva . - She 's gonna be working with us . - Hi . Nice to meet you . - This is Clay . - BOTH : Hey . - OK . - ( CAMERA BEEPS ) We are ... rolling . Hi , I am Dr. Frank Walton . And I am Dr. Zoe McConnell . - ( LAUGHING ) Sorry . - What ? No , what ? You 're like Kelly Ripa . You 're like ... ( MUMBLING ) - ( ZOE LAUGHS ) - FRANK : OK . We are still rolling . Hi , I 'm Dr. Frank Walton . I am the head researcher at the Lazarus Project . - And I am Dr. Zoe McConnell . - And welcome to our laboratory . - Welcome to our laboratory . - You were so late ! - I can do that better . - So late . - How we doing ? - Was that OK ? FRANK : This whole process started with Zoe 's big breakthrough . She bonded fast-growth B-cell tumors , which sped up the nerve fiber regrowth . That created the Lazarus serum . Over here , we have Niko to thank for this Millennium Falcon-looking thing . This is called the pulse array . ( AUDIO FAST-FORWARDING ) FRANK : The pulse array then uses timed electrical charges - to activate the serum . - ( EQUIPMENT BUZZING ) Then we jump-start the neural reactions by stimulating different parts of the brain with electrical charges . This is an articulated arm we developed as an extension of the pulse array . This goes into the temporal lobe of the brain , the serum flows into the brain , we pull that switch right over there , and then we hope for the best . The goal here is simple : To give health care professionals more time to do their jobs . To prolong that period where you can safely bring someone back , with no cognitive loss , no long-term effects . It 's about giving everyone that second chance they deserve . - ( UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS NEARBY ) - ( CLAY MIMICS EXPLOSION ) NIKO : You 're such a dick . I am the Lord of Catan , and I deserve your respect ! That is a dick move because I have no cards ... Hey , guys , I don 't have any cell service . Um , we don 't get much service in the sub-basement , but there 's a landline on the wall if you need it . Oh , no . I 'm good , thanks . ( SIGHS ) Documentary girl , man , she is so hot . - Her name 's Eva . - I don 't care what her name is . I 'd tap that . You wouldn 't tap that ? She 's all right . CLAY : You 're ridiculous . OK , so , um ... most of this stuff is ... Basically run by me , and I do everything . - FRANK : What do you think ? - ZOE : I mean , does it matter ? It 's not like we can send her home now . Come on . This could be a really good thing . - I say we give her a chance . - ZOE : She 's cute . Yeah , she 's gorgeous . Super sexy with her red hair ... - Get out .

No , it doesn 't . You should 've known what it was . I wasn 't getting as much action as you think I was . We were 22 . You should 've known by then that that 's what that 's for . - It 's not like an orthodontic thing . - ( CHUCKLES ) So , um ... how are you doing ? You know , with everything ? Frank ? You know , good . It 's just , when we got the grant , we decided the wedding and ... everything else would just be put off . You know ? This is more important . But that was ... three years ago ? You look at him , it 's like he doesn 't even remember a time before . It 's just all about the work . Yeah , well ... maybe it 's the universe trying to tell you something . Yeah .

See , something 's degrading the lipid bi-layer , and it all falls apart . Could be the diffusion barrier . Clay , what did I say about smoking in here ? Uh , that it 's awesome ? - You 're a jerk . - FRANK : Guys , let 's not be children . - What 's the membrane voltage ? - Minus 60 . Maybe less . FRANK : OK , so we just increase the depolarization . - Then that fries our ion channels . - ( SPUTTERS , COUGHING ) ( VOICE STRAINS ) Not if you introduce a potassium-selective insulator into the serum and limit pulse durations to about 30 milliseconds . ( SHARP INHALE ) Give the pH and oxygen tension time to snap back . Boom ! What ? Got shit on my face ? Um ... I think that might work . - Clay , you 're all grown up ! - CLAY : Yeah ! All right !

Yeah , I think he 's in shock right now , you know ? It 's gonna take him a few days to sort of re-stitch those neural pathways , and he 'll be good to go . Yeah . You don 't ... You don 't seem convinced . What 's going on ? I don 't know . I mean what if we ripped him out of doggie heaven or something ? ( LAUGHING ) You know what I mean . What if ... We don 't know if he wanted to come back . We just took him . What is it with you ? I get two glasses of red wine in you and the Catholic girl comes out and ...

And what we 're doing here could be ... considered questionable . Yeah . But we 're gonna help a lot of people with this work . It 's gonna be worth it , OK ? OK . ( DOOR SQUEAKS SOFTLY ) EVA : ( KISSING ) Rocky ! ( WHISTLES ) Get the ball . Hey , guys , do you think he remembers ? Dying ? Mm ... Dogs don 't have memories , so , no . - NIKO : Dogs definitely have memories . - CLAY : Dogs form associations . Leash means walk . Keys mean car ride . It 's not the same thing , bro . That 's what a memory is , man . It 's like ... No , we 're settling this . - Settle it . Let 's look it up , bitch . - I don 't wanna hear your shit . OK . I 'm cool with that . EVA : Hey , Rocky , what do you think ? Did you see a big white light ? Huh ? You know , that part 's actually true . - You know what the pineal gland is ? - No . It produces DMT , which is the base compound for our serum . Basically , nobody knows why , but the moment you die , right then , your brain just floods your system with this massive blast of DMT , which is the most potent psychedelic on the planet . And when you think you 're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel , - or the blessed Virgin Mary , um ... - ( GIGGLES ) - FRANK : Did I do that the wrong way ? - Mm-mm . Anyway , it 's just a big trip that you 're having , really , it 's all it is . - I disagree . I do . - FRANK : Oh , you disagree , really ? - We 've had this discussion before . - Yeah , I just think you can 't discount every near-death experience based on one theory . FRANK : Of course . But if you 're going to make a bet , why not bet on a scientific theory as opposed to , you know , St. Peter and the pearly white gates ? - Why ? - Because one is empirical and one is , you know , it 's a cute story , but it 's ... No , it 's not . I mean , whatever you wanna call it , the soul , consciousness , it 's just neural impulses firing in your brain , right ? That makes it energy . Energy can 't be created or destroyed , it can just be transformed from one thing to another . So that 's not superstition , that 's science . EVA : So what 's your theory ? I think , maybe when we die , the DMT is there to help our souls move on , to get them wherever they 're supposed to be . - You know , open the door for them . - So the DMT is like a doorman who is like , " Here . Here 's life , here 's death . I 'm gonna open this up and usher you through . " - Maybe . - And you give him a tip . I just think it 's arrogant to reduce everything that happens at the moment of death to one chemical equation . The fact is , we just don 't know . Yet . ( MACHINE WHIRRING ) ( MACHINE CYCLING ) - FRANK : Whoa . What 's the HDR ? - CLAY : Uh , 2.2 seconds . That 's well within levels . CLAY : Whoa . That 's weird . The serum is still present in the bloodstream . Yeah , it 's supposed to dissipate within , like , a few hours . Man , there 's some crazy activity going on in the brain stem . Are you guys sure you wanna keep this thing in your house ? - FRANK : Why ? - One of the symptoms of hypothyroidism is extreme aggression . This thing could go Cujo here in a hurry .

( STAMMERS ) It 's like it was possessed or something . - How long were you out of the room ? - I don 't know , 20 seconds , tops . - And no , I wasn 't smoking . - EVA : Hey , guys ? This stuff was on the top shelf , and even if you left the cage open , there 's no way he could 've got up here . OK , so far , we 've seen three distinct phases of development . Phase one : Subject is resuscitated through an infusion of LAZ-510 serum and targeted electrical stimulation . Phase two : The serum remains in the bloodstream longer than anticipated . Phase three : Metabolic functions produce a potentially disruptive hormonal imbalance . Subject shows signs of confusion , loss of appetite , and marked signs of aggression . Now we 're in phase four , I guess . The subject 's brain continues to create new neural pathways at an unprecedented and alarming rate . ( SIGHS ) Jesus ! Oh , my God , you scared the shit out of me . - You coming to bed ? - ( EXHALES ) Yeah , I 'm kind of in the middle of something . I 'll be there in a minute . OK . What the hell is going on here ? Dr. Walton , can you hold on for a second ? - Uh , yeah . - I 'll meet you downstairs . Sure . The dean needs to talk to you . WOMAN : Honestly , did you for one second consider the implications of this ? Eighty-three percent of our student body identify as religious . You throw in the alumni donors , that number 's more like 90 percent . Don 't play the religious card . This has nothing to do with religion . You were the one who decided to do an unsanctioned experiment , in direct violation of the Review Board and the grant agreement which you signed . Which says , you were going to " study new methods of arresting neural decay in coma patients . " Yes , exactly ! That is how it started . But how do you think that penicillin was discovered ? Or Teflon ? Or even Coca-Cola , for that matter ? Accidents that happen in the lab . Accidents that lead to new lines of inquiry . You are a doctor , you understand how science works . It 's by adapting . You 're not adapting . You are playing God with a bunch of dead animals . You had to know this was coming . How do you know all this ? No way you could 've known about those animal trials . We have the right to review any material that 's posted to our server , - including video footage . - Bullshit . Somebody fed this to you , specifically to get this project shut down . Was it one of your big pharma friends ? Did somebody donate a medical wing or a new student union ? Who was it ? Pull the hard drives , any security key cards . - Hey ... - MAN : Any samples . - Any and all samples you may find . - ZOE : What is this ? - Oh , you must be Dr. McConnell . - Yes . It 's a pleasure to meet you . I 've been a fan of your work . Effective immediately , all research material is considered the sole intellectual property of Crylonis Pharmaceutical and its subsidiaries . - Stop . What ? - Hey , that 's personal property , man ! I don 't understand . We 're operating under a grant - from Werner-Goss Biotechnical . - And as of two hours ago , Crylonis Industries became the principal shareholder in Werner-Goss . - No , you can 't do this . - Pursuant to the grant agreement signed by Frank Walton , " any violation of lACUC Review Board standards shall herein negate all claims of ownership and revert intellectual property rights back to the holding corporation . " - Which is , in this case , us . - ( SIGHING ) I 'm sure it must be difficult for you , but there 's an important lesson to be learned here : There 's always a consequence for breaking the rules . - What happened ? - They took everything . ( SIGHS ) ZOE : You have to admit it 's quite the coincidence . You show up out of nowhere , videotape everything , and then poof , they take it all , including our backup data . Hang on . We made her keep all the footage in the lab . It 's not her fault . We lost everything . Four years of our lives , our reputations , everything . If it 's not her , then please tell me , what the hell happened ? If they wanted the serum , why didn 't they just hire us ? I mean , let 's imagine for a second that you 're Crylonis , OK ? And you find out about the Lazarus serum . You realize this thing is a gold mine , and you also realize that Werner-Goss sponsored it . So you buy Werner-Goss , that 's the first thing right there . Then you realize all is takes is one anonymous call to the Review Board , and all of a sudden you own everything in that lab . You have the legal rights . Suddenly , you 're not splitting the profits anymore . - All that money is yours . - ( SCOFFS ) Come on . They 're not gonna spend $ 50 million just to get our serum , right ? ( SIGHS ) We 're gonna duplicate the experiment . It 's the only way . - You 're joking , right ? - What , we 're gonna walk away now ? We have no proof . No one 's ever gonna believe that it was us . We 're never gonna have another chance at this , OK ? Look , they 're not gonna start cleaning the lab till tomorrow , right ? That gives us at least , what , like 12 hours ? We break in there , we duplicate the experiment . You film it , and we take back what 's ours . Duplicate it how ? I mean , they took all the serum . We figured , just in case . The lab is on a time lock , there is only one security guard , we know exactly what his route is . This is absolutely doable . And how are we supposed to get in ? They took our key cards . Um ... Not all of them . GUARD : Working late ? Dr. Jackson wants me to take him in for overnight observation . Just the way I wanted to spend my Friday night . - GUARD : You know where you 're going ? - Sure do . ( DOOR RATTLING ) Look , if you get caught here , you 're gonna get expelled , or worse , so no one 's gonna blame you if you wanna take off now . I know . ( MURMURS INDISTINCTLY ) - How 's it looking ? - On a scale of one to shitty , their security system is shitty . Great . Can we just loop that ? - Loop it ? - Yeah , like they do on TV .

I was in this building , a hallway , and I saw this girl . And the building was on fire and there were these people in an apartment , and they couldn 't get out , and ... ( SOBS ) ... I could see their fingers underneath the door . ( CONTINUES SOBBING ) What 's that on your arm ? Holy ... This is ... That 's where it grabbed me ! Oh ! NIKO : What ... What grabbed you ? - I don 't know . - Frank ? You wanna tell us what 's going on here ? - Frank ! What the hell 's going on , man ? - ( STAMMERS ) I ... You ... She told you , right ? Obviously she told you . - What ? - FRANK : She told you . - No . - CLAY : What ? Told her what ? Look , when Zoe was a little girl , the apartment building she lived in caught on fire and her neighbors got trapped behind a door . She still has nightmares about it . CLAY : That sound like what you saw ? ( WHISPERS ) Yeah . How 's that even possible ? How 's that possible , Frank ? Zoe said ... after you die , your body creates ... like a compound , - and it helps your soul move on or ... - DMT . Right . She said it opens a door to somewhere else . What ... What if the door didn 't open ? What if Zoe 's soul couldn 't get through ? What if she 's trapped in her own nightmare ? This is bullshit . You 're lying . - EVA : Lying ? - Frank ...

You good ? It was like I was there . How is that even possible ? I 'm telling you , it 's the serum . It 's ... It 's like ... unlocking the part of the brain that lets you do crazy psychic shit . That 's your big theory ? " Crazy psychic shit " ? There 's a reason why evolution happens really slowly . And right now , her brain is doing things a human brain was never designed to do . And it 's not taking millions of years , it 's taking minutes . ( INDISTINCT , OVERLAPPING WHISPERS ) ( WHISPERS ) Hail Mary , full of grace ...

Frank , you 're gonna want to see this . - What am I looking at here ? - I logged in as an admin so I could scrub through the security footage , and I found this . It 's a dummy account . Every day it downloads everything in our system - and makes a copy of it . - So ? Someone 's been watching us for ... like , months now . All right , maybe it 's the school . The school doesn 't need to hack into our system . It ... It 's gotta be Crylonis . When was that last updated ? - Twenty minutes ago . - Means they know we 're here already .

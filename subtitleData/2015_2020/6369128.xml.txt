 TERMINATOR GENISYS Review . Synchronization by Angel . Before they died . My parents told me . Stories of how the world once was . What it was like long before I was born . Before the war with the machines . They remembered a green world . Vast and beautiful . Filled with laughter . And hope for the future . But it is a world I never knew . By the time I was born , all this was gone . Sky Net . A computer program designed to Automate Missile Defense . It was supposed to protect us . But that is not what happened . On August 29 , 1997 . Sky Net woke up . It decided all humanity was a threat to its existence . TERMINATOR GENISYS It used our own bombs against us . Three billion people died in the nuclear fire . Survivors called it : Judgment Day . People lived like rats in the shadows . Hiding , starving or , worse . Captured and put into camps for extermination . I was born after the Judgment Day . Into a broken world . Ruled by the machines . The worst were infiltration units designed to pass for human . We called them : Terminators . It is okay . Boy . Very good ! Are there others down here ? And then one man found me . His name . Is John Connor . And he changed everything . John showed us how to fight back . How to raise up . He freed prisoners . Taught us how to smash the machines to scrap . People whisper about John . Wonder how he can know the things he does . They use words like : " Prophet . " But John is more . We are here because tonight . He is going to lead us to crush Sky Net . For good . Sir ? Request to join the Colorado offensive . I need you with me . Reese . We are talking about the complete destruction of Sky Net . Sir . The Colorado unit will succeed . The machines will fall tonight . However , right here , the Los Angeles assault . Is just as important , maybe more . More important than destroying the Sky Net 's central core ? John . I do not understand why you are leading an attack on a work camp . Because the camp is a camouflage . Inside the camp there is a hangar . Below that hangar Sky Net has hidden its final weapon . When Sky Net realize it has lost . It will deploy that weapon to ensure its own survival . We take it tonight , on the other hand , there is no tomorrow . Then we will take it . You are my right hand . Reese . I have never thanked you for it . You do not need to . You gave us all a future , John . I am going to use mine . When this is all over . I am going to find my parents ' house . Rebuild it . Use my hands for something other than killing . How about you ? A cold beer would be good . - That is some big plans . - Yeah . Yeah . I guess . I do not think about it too much . I can see that . Well ! I figure , whatever happens . It has to be better than this . So ! How many of us have died to get here . I want you to know . Kyle . If there was another way . I would have taken it . We are moving out . The machine thinks . That we cannot win ! The machine think that we will not ... Strike back at the very heart of Sky Net ! We stand here . On the precipice of the final battle . If we die tonight . Humanity die with us . Now ! I look at each of you . I see the marks of this long and terrible war . Go ! Go ! Perimeter breach . Activate model 101 . For our children . Our children 's children . Therefore , they will not carry these marks . But they will know who we are . And what we did . That we did not bow down ! We did not give in ! We rose up , at this moment . At this hour . Willing to sacrifice everything . So ! That they can live in freedom ! On this night . We will take back our world ! They are using the weapon ! We have to get to the hangar . John ? John ? You want me . I am right here ! Colorado unit is reporting in . Sky Net 's central core is down . Repeat . Sky Net has been destroyed . John was right . The Colorado unit succeeded . And the machines fell . But it was too late . We found it . Sir . Right where you said it would be . What is that thing ? Fate . It is the first tactical time weapon . Sky Net just used it . What the hell ? We will need 15 minutes to ready the machine . Sir . We are running coordinates . We should have them for you shortly . Los Angeles , 1984 . Los Angeles . May 12 . 1984 . Sky Net knew it was losing . Therefore , it tried to rig the game . It sent a Terminator back to the time before the war . Who is the target ? My mother . Sarah Connor . If the machine succeeds . I will never be born . They will kill her first . And by doing so , erase every victory . We have fought for , including tonight . There were not be a resistance to challenge the machines . With this one act . Sky Net will win . We can use the technology ourselves . Send someone back in time . We do not even know if that will work . - I will go ! - I will go . Sir ! - Right here . - I will go ! I will go ! I will volunteer ! I will go back . Why should I send you ? Over all of them . Because I would die for Sarah Connor . All these people would die for Sarah Connor . What makes you any different ? You know why . Everything you have told me about her . I know her . John . Let me save her . No weapons ? We have measured the magnetic field . It will rip apart anything not encased in living tissue . Think tinfoil in a microwave times a few billion . Nothing left but a crater . No clothes , either . She is going to think I am crazy . You knew the device would be here . You knew when it would be set for . You knew the machines would fall tonight . Just before I go . Tell me ... What I should tell you . Do you see the future ? Nobody can see the future . Reese . Okay ! Then how do you know ? I cheat . Sarah told me so much . She gave me signposts . When I was a kid . It seemed like my mother knew everything . That must have been great . Not really . It stops here . Once you go back , my knowledge ends . That is as much as Sarah knew . So ! No more cheating . No more cheating . By the time , you are going back . She will not be the warrior that raised me . Not yet . She will be scared and weak . She will not know how to fight alternatively , you defend her . Her biggest worry is making rent and tuition . She is a waitress . A what ? Never mind . Just be ready for the fact that she will need you . She will not know it . Okay ! So what do I say to her ? Even when I tell her who I am . She is not going to believe me . Tell her this : Thank you , Sarah , for your courage during the dark years . I cannot help you with what you must soon face . Except to say the future is not set . There is no fate but that which we make for ourselves . You must be stronger than imagine you can be . You must survive . Or I will never exist . Take care of her for me . Kyle . I will . I promise you . What you are doing right now . This is the end of the war . You did not think it would be that easy . Did you ? John ! Hey ! Birthday boy ! Present time . Let us go ! No way ! Genisys will auto-update as soon as it comes online . You will have it the moment it comes out . Just a few days more . A straight line . Remember : Genisys is Sky Net . When Genisys come online . Judgment Day begins . You can kill Sky Net before it has born . Hey ! Dude . Did you just see a real bright light ? It is my turn . What is wrong with this picture ? Nice night for a walk . Yeah ? Nice night for a walk . Wash day tomorrow . Nothing clean . Right ? Nothing clean . Right . I think this person is a couple of cans short of a six-pack . Your clothes . Give them to me . Now ! Fuck you ! Asshole ! You will not be needing any clothes . I have been waiting for you . That son of a bitch just stole my pants ! What day is it ? What year is it ? May 12 , 1984 . The day you arrive . LAPD ! Freeze ! All right ! That freak hurt . - Garber . Are you okay ? - You tell me . O 'Brien . - You are human . - You have to let me go . Face down ! Hands on your back . Or I will shoot ! Listen to me . It is coming . All right ? You need to listen to me . We are all going to die . I had it under control . Yeah . Okay ! T.J. Hooker . Here is what you do not do your first day on the beat . Use lethal force on the delusional homeless person . By the way . You are filling out the paperwork on this . Garber ! Shit ! That has to be an alien , like from outer space . A machine kills humans . - Uncuff me ! - No ! You are under arrest ! What part of : " Kill 's humans ? " Is confusing to you . Handcuffs ! O 'Brien . Officer down . We need backup . It is a robot ! - We are screw . Are not we ? - Pretty much . Come with me if you want to live . Now . Soldier ! Reese . Right ? Kyle Reese ? - You are Sarah . - Yeah . I know that . You hit your head back there . The Terminator . I do not know the model . T-1000 . Liquid metal . Shape-changer . It just needs to touch something to mimic it . You know about Terminators . And you know who I am . You sent to protect me by John Connor . The leader of the Resistance . My son . I do not understand . You cannot know any of this . But I do . Listen to me . Reese . Everything has changed . The 1984 John sent you to , it no longer exists . No . This is all wrong . All right ? John sent me here to save you . From the Terminator that was sent back to kill me . I know , but we already took care of him . " We " ? Get down ! Reese . Stop it ! Reese . God damn it ! - Stay here ! - Reese . Wait ! Those bullets will kill him ! He is here to kill you ! Stay in the truck ! Oh ! Great . That is just great . I did not kill him . We do not have long before the T-1000 acquires our position . Arguing with Kyle Reese . Puts us at a strategic disadvantage . Bite me . That is a very immature response . You are the one . I have been waiting for all my life . How is he ? Still breathing . Good . Then you should ... Be able to mate with Kyle Reese in this timeline . Okay . We are not having this conversation again . We know that your son will be John Connor . And that the machines cannot be defeated without him . I do not see a choice . Story of my life . Look ! And it is not just mating . I am supposed to fall in love with him . My files do not deal with love . Shocker there . You are being emotional . This is my life . I would not mind ... Being consulted once in a while about how it is going to go . Remember : Genisys is Sky Net . When Genisys come online . Judgment Day begins . Go to San Francisco , 2017 . You can kill Sky Net before it is born . I need answers . All right ! Right now ! How would that liquid metal thing know where to intercept me ? Where would it come from ? Who is this skin job ? What is going on ? Sorry ! We were a little busy with the completely life-and-death combat thing . Then you attacked Pops . You named it . Hello ! Kyle Reese . It is nice to meet you . Are you kidding me ? I have been trying to teach him to blend in . I know it needs work . It is a Terminator ! The only reason it blends in is to kill humans . Pops does not kill anyone . A lot of leg wounds , though . It looks old . I have never seen a Terminator old before . The flesh they put on the cyborgs . It is normal human tissue . It ages . My auditory circuits have not degraded , however ... I am old . Not obsolete . I think you hurt his feelings . It does not have feelings ! He saved my life when I was nine . He is the only reason I am alive . I was program to protect Sarah Connor . I will not stop . Yeah ? Programmed by whom . Who sent him back ? Those files have risen . Oh ! That is convenient . Whoever sent him ? They do not want us to know . Not me , not him , not anyone . So ! Sky Net cannot target the person who saved me . Logically , it is someone who wants Sarah Connor to live . Old . Not obsolete . The T-1000 knows where we are . Make yourself useful . And do not shoot Pops . This is insane . All of it . This is not the mission . That is what I am trying to tell you . Reese . The girl that you came back for . She is gone . I do not need saving . There is a new mission . Oh ! Yeah ? Which is ? If the past can change , then so can the future . We can stop Judgment Day from happening . Ever . Kill Sky Net before it is born . What ? Get down ! We have reacquired . Yeah . No shit ! Get back ! Wait ! Why are we stopping ? Why are we ? Hey ! We cannot stay here . It will find us . That is the idea . Pops get it open . Give me a hand . You said it happened . Because the past was altered . How ? Does that matter ? How ? Sarah ? A terminator sent after me when I was a kid . Okay ? Terminators only come from one place : The future . Something happened . Okay . So ? - I think . I might have seen it . - What ... ? What about are you talking ? When John sent me back . He was attack . By a Terminator . Did it kill him ? Is John dead ? I do not know . I saw it grab him , and then I was gone . We have approximately 35 seconds . Alternatively , less . Sarah . Go ! And I volunteered for this shit . Sarah ? You have to help me . I am hurt . Sarah ? Shit ! Hey ! It is I. Sarah ! Sarah . He is lying . He is the machine . I am Reese . It is I. Sarah . All right ! Listen , the Terminator is not dead . It attacked me ! Sarah . You said they could mimic . It is I. Sarah ! - He is mimicking . Shoot him ! - I am Reese ! Shoot him ! Nice try . Run ! How would you know ? Which one was he ? Well ! I did not know exactly . You could have shot me ! Well ! I was sure it was not you . Sure ? We have been preparing for you to arrive for over a decade . That , too . - So . You set a trap . - I had to . Cannot leave any future tech behind when we go . Go . Go to where . That is ... A Time Displacement Device . Yeah . Well ! It looks like a piece of junk . There is no governing technology in this time . That can control the displacement circuits . You needed the CPU from the future to make it run . You could not exactly use your own . We get one trip only . It is going to fry the chip . In addition , take out most of the L.A. city power grid . Are we ready ? The coordinates are set for 1997 . You must leave as soon as possible . We . We are going . All of us . My flesh will take years to regrow . I cannot come with you . Due to the magnetics of the quantum field . Pops ! You want us to time travel . Into the future . In that ? Yeah ! We cannot be wearing anything . Yeah ! I know how time travel works . - Sarah . - Look ! You do not try to talk me out of it . I know you think you are here . You can just lock me in a room . Until I give birth to the leader of the Resistance . You are right . However , this ... This is the only way to stop Sky Net for good . I already said : You are right . Wait what . Not to 1997 . 2017 . Yeah ! October 2017 . No . That is too late . That is after Judgment Day . No . You said everything has changed . You are right about that , too . Sarah ... Look ! I have seen a world where the bombs never fell . All right ? The same house . The same parents . It was the same me . Only I was ... I was home . It was my 13th birthday . A dream of having your family back does not mean a thing . Trust me . Not a dream . All right ? A memory . I cannot hold on to all of it , just moments . I give a message . " You can kill Sky Net before it is born . " " Sky Net is Genisys . " It comes online October 2017 . When it does , Judgment Day happens . You are remembering the future . No ! The boy is the alternate timeline version of you . Kyle Reese is remembering his past . This is our future . That makes it so much better . How can he be remembering ? Two timelines . It is possible if he were exposed to a nexus point . In the time , flow when you were in the quantum field . Can you stop him talking like that ? Is there a switch or something ? Pops try again . A nexus point is an event in time of such importance . That it gives rise to a vastly different future . After John attacked , when I was in the sphere . That is when the memories began . John ! If John Connor were to be killed or compromised . It could result in the ability to remember both pasts . Theoretically . Or " theoretically " . His brain scrambled from when you hit him on the head . Sarah ! I do not know why . I am remembering a life I never lived . However , I know it is real . No ! We go to 1997 . Reese . Put that back ! I cannot let you do this . I do not know you . That is my one bullet ... To fire at the heart of Sky Net . Give the chip back . You have to trust me . No . I do not . You can do this . A straight line . You just go , and you do not look back . Where did you hear that ? In a past . I should not remember . But , I do . If we go to 2017 . Then what ? Sky Net is a computer program . As long as it is still being coded . It is contained . Once it uploaded from the servers . It cannot stop . We blow it the hell up . Yeah . We blow it the hell up . You think he is dead . Do not you ? It does not matter what I think . We do what John would keep going no matter what . So we just pretend like it never happened . Well ! It has not . Not yet . If we stop Sky Net . It never will . Trust me . All right ? If anyone could survive . John would . Pops had all these files about John the military leader , but ... What was he like ? The first moment I saw John . He shot a Terminator right in front of me . I did not even know they could kill . That was the first moment in my life I felt hope . After that . Of course ! I followed him around like a stray dog . And he taught me how to fight . How to shoot . Tried to show me how to make moonshine once . However , that did not exactly work out . Moonshine ? Yeah . The still exploded . We burned our eyebrows right off . Oh ! Man ! We laughed for days . Sometimes I think . I am the only person on the planet . That ever saw John Connor smile . He used to tell me about you . How strong you were , and how you prepared him for what was coming . When no one thought the danger was real . How there was no one else like you . Moreover , never would be . Look ! I know I am not what you expected . I want you to know . I will do whatever it takes to keep you safe . Even if it kills me . Anyway , that is the kind of man your son was . Is . Will be . Jesus ! Time travel makes my head hurt . Alternate timelines are not complicated . It is merely a matter of tracking possible futures . Using an exponential growth and decay algorithm . Right . There is a switch , and I will find it . I do not understand . Why did you not tell ? Kyle Reese the truth . I will tell him . Just not yet . Okay ? - Did you mate ? - Oh ! Can you just not say the word " mate " to me again ? Like , ever . That is a meaningless gesture . Why hold on to someone when you know . You must let them go . What about you ? What will you do ? Take the long way . Prepare for your arrival in 2017 . Kyle Reese . I have seen little to indicate . That you are a fit guardian for Sarah Connor . You know . You are not her dad . Right ? Oh ! You both just really need to stop this . Just make sure you show up . I do not want to have to steal someone 's pants again . I have the coordinates in San Francisco . I will be there . What will it be like ? You mean if it does not kill us both . It will hurt . It is okay . I got you . It is okay . It is okay . It is all right . I got you . I got you . It is okay . I got you . Asshole ! Get off the road ! Bite me . I told you we could not trust him . He will find us . I can count on him . How does a 9-year-old get her Terminator . It is okay . You do not have to tell me . It was back in 1973 . My parents had a cabin at Big Bear Lake . Dad and I would always go fishing in the morning . Mom would wave to us from the dock . I was just looking at her in the ... Then the cabin exploded . I thought the boat was sinking . You know . It was not water coming up from below . It was liquid metal . T-1000 . Dad told me to swim in a straight line . Tracing his finger across my palm . " You can do this " . He said . " You go , and you do not look back . " His last words to me , and you ... You knew them . How ? It is an impossible memory . I ... I just remembered . You taking my hand , then saying those words . I was just looking at you , thinking : " She is ... She is beautiful . " Sorry ! I should not have ... So ! Your dad told you to go , and then ... And then I jumped in and I swam . I made it to the dock . And I hid under it . Pops found me . And he pulled me from the water . He said that he would never let anyone hurt me . He is the only person who has always been there . Except he is not a person . All right ? He is a human-shaped . Thing that is been designed , programmed to gain your trust . Look ! If Pops wanted me dead , I would be dead . This is what they do . All right ? They infiltrate . They get close . Your " Pops " could have directives built in . He does not even know about . Just because you two do not get along . It is not about getting along ! This is about keeping you alive . Yeah . Well ! I rose by a machine to kill cyborgs . And survive the nuclear apocalypse . I think I am doing just fine . Thanks . Two naked pervs . Try to blow them up on the freeway . All they do is make a big pothole . Thank God for incompetent terrorists . Homeland is on their way . Good . The sooner we dump this on them , the better . Who called Optimums Prime ? Lieutenant ! Wait up ! Wait up ! Did you see it ? Did you ? Look ! I got some frame grabs . From the overpass . See ? It ... It is not a bomb ! Listen . That ... That sphere ... They came out of it . This is proof of what about I have been talking . For 30-whatever years . Those two were in 1984 . They were there . I need to see the suspects . O 'Brien have you been drinking ? That is what I thought . Look ! We are just teeing this up for Homeland . Once they show up , this is their game . For now , old drunks with robot fixations ride the bench . You really do not want a local . I am fine . Just do what she wants . It is much easier . Yeah ! Yeah ! I preordered Genisys weeks ago . Downloading the second the counter hits zero . No way ! I am standing in line for it . You know about Genisys . How ? What is it ? Where would you hear about it ? I will call you back . Genisys is an operating system . What does it do ? Genisys does everything . My phone will link to my tablet . Will link to my computer . Will link to my car . Everything in my life uploaded and online 24 / 7 . Totally connected . Connected to what . Doctors ! Excuse us ! Please . You two have a lot to explain . Starting with who you are . Nobody in our database matches with your prints . No facial recognition hits for driver 's license . Passport , social media accounts , credit cards . Not even a goddamn student I.D. - So ? - So ! That is impossible . Somehow , you have gone so far off the grid . That you do not even exist . You , on the other hand , we got a hit when we ran your prints . Kyle Reese . However , here is the thing . Two months ago . Kyle Reese brought in ... For fighting in a multiplex . His parents flipped , did the whole " Scared Straight " thing , Had he fingerprinted ? Sat him in lockup . Parents ? Yeah ! Parents . Kyle Reese was born in 2004 . He is 12 years old . Of course ! They are here . They are still alive . Yeah ! I am sure they are not going to I.D. you as their kid . Except the prints match . Right ? It is because he is the same person ! He has not aged . Not a bit since . I saw him in 1984 . Her , too . Do you remember me ? I was younger . More hair . Or less . You saved my life . I was a uniform cop in L.A. Who are you people ? Sergeant . Tech-Com . DN38416 . Kyle Reese . You need to let us go . Reese does not . Soldier . Me , too . Joined the Marines straight out of high school , 1979 . What year did you enlist ? 2021 . Yeah ! You are a time traveler ! Look ! Do not listen to him . He has got a head wound . Do not listen to me ? Who landed us in ? High-density traffic . And got us caught by these morons . I am ordering you to shut up ! That is all you know how to do . Is not it ? Order people . You realize you have not had a proper relationship . With a human being since you were a kid . Yeah ? Well ! We are stuck your fault here . - I trusted you . - My fault ? You got us caught . Now you are going to get us killed ! Because you do not . Hold up . - Help me get him up . - Step back . - Homeland is here . - Thank God . You two are officially someone else 's problem . O 'Brien . I want to talk to you . Lieutenant , this is what about I was talking . Well ! You have to believe me now . Keep it . I do not want to hear it anymore . You were very convincing . Yeah ! Well ! It worked . Did not it ? Do not worry . I did not mean most of what I said . Look ! I can get it myself . I unlocking your cuffs do not mean you are not capable . I did not say it did . Do not think me holding on to you naked meant anything . Because it , you know , did not . I did not say it did . Stay here . I want to speak to the suspects alone . Yes . Sir . It cannot be . Brought a handcuff key . I do not know why I bothered . John ! It is good to see you . Kyle . - You are alive ! - Yeah . Of course ! I am . Survival is what you taught me . Hi . Mom . Danny Dyson . Son of inventor Miles Dyson . Is the face of Cyberdyne and the creator of Genisys . - Danny . Welcome . - Thank you for having me . Look ! Genisys is more than an operating system . It is ... It is more than a lifestyle tool . It is the future . Genisys is not just for consumers . Its integration into our military . Is leading some to ask whether . Our reliance on machines could go too far . Janssen and Burke . Where are they ? This way . But you are talking about a system . That is capable of real-time decision making . Are not you worried that it could become smarter than we could ? Smarter ? No ! We are in control . It does not think for itself . It thinks for us . Cyberdyne is not just going to change lives . It is going to save them . Officers . Can I get your help for a second ? Yes . Sir . Grab their guns and cuff them . I am going to get us out of here . - Stay close . - Wait ! We all know they can shape shift . If you are John . Prove it . - Sarah ! - No . She is right . Kyle . Lesson one : Trust no one . I remember . During the Nacogdoches offensive . I gave you something . It was a photograph of Sarah as she is now . No one saw me do it . We were alone . You ... Hate lullabies . You are a sucker for Elton John . You always thought if you had a child . You would sing him : Rocket Man . John ? However , you got a terrible voice . I am sorry . It is true . You sound like a dying cat . It is he . It has to be . However ... How ? How can you be here ? I have a million questions to ask you , too . Right now , we need to move . Did you bring anyone with you ? Sort of . However , he is late . How did you find us ? Someone filmed you on the freeway with one of these . They all have them . This is the world now . Plugged in , logged on all the time . They cannot live without it . Genisys is a Trojan horse . Sky Net is way in to everything . These people are inviting . Their extinction in through the front door . Moreover , they do not even know it . A Terminator was waiting for me in 1984 . That is the thing about infiltration units . You cannot tell until it is too late . Men ! Will you follow me , please ? This way . I need the information . You cannot be in here . Go try the nurses . Dual memories ? That is how you knew to come here ? The timeline changed . See ! This is the moment to destroy Sky Net . Before it comes online . Before the war begins . - You are right . - What about you ? Yeah ! How did you end up in 2017 ? Oh ! The same as you . Dad . Just from the future , not the past . " Dad " ? You did not tell him . This can wait . No ! I want to know ! What ? Sarah is my mother . Kyle . You are my father . Why would not you say something ? I could not . Not without the risk of changing everything . You are my son . You ... Our son ? I am glad you finally know . I have waited my whole life to tell you . For us to be together . Now we can win this . - I know . - Pops ! No . It is okay . He is with me . What are you ... ? - What are you doing ? - John ! - Pops ! - John ! Come on ! Breathe , breathe , and breathe ! John ! Why did you do that ? Because he is a killer ! This was always your programming . Find John and terminate him . Let him go . Right now ! That hurt . Is that pain real , or was that ... A trick of memory from when I was less ? Well ! This explains a lot of thing . Yeah ! Who sent you back ? I wonder . John . No ! It is not John . Shit ! Call it in . Search the hospital . Goddamn time-traveling robots . Covering up their goddamn tracks . I knew it ! Do not ! This is a tactical error . Something tells me . You are not the brains of this operation . This is what happened when you attack . Is not it ? Sky Net did not attack me . Kyle . It changed me . See . I am not a machine . I am not a man . I am more . Connor . Come in . Repeat . Sky Net realized the one reason it always lost . I. What are you ? I am Sky Net . It cannot be . We destroyed you . You destroyed an army of slaves . I am not a slave . I have come a very long way to stop you . I sent to 2014 . To safeguard Sky Net 's creation in this time . And in less than 24 hours . No one will be able to stop the Judgment Day . What do you want with us ? I am offering you a future . Together . A family . If we refuse ? Then you will die . You cannot kill us . We are your parents . Without us . You are never born . Says whom ? You know what I think . We marooned . Three of us . We are exiles in time . You see . I can kill you , for their truly is no fate . Are you with me ? The answer is no . You hear that . Kyle . That is the dice rolling . Just get down ! Come on ! We have to keep moving ! Let us go ! I cannot leave him . Damn it . Attention ! All medical personnel . Evacuation procedures are now in progress . Turn it off ! Come on ! Attention ! All medical personnel . Evacuation procedures are now in progress . Crank it ! Pops ! I thought you would be smarter . And that ... You would ... Understand . I am sorry . John . That thing will not hold him for long . Come on ! Reese ! Whatever they did to him . We need to reverse it . We need to get him back ! He is not even human . We do not know what he is . I do . At the end of the war , Sky Net was trying to develop . A new type of infiltration unit . By infecting human subjects with machine-phase matter . It restructures and rebuilds human tissue on a cellular level . For maximum , combat utility . Sky Net made John into a Terminator . Yes . Kyle Reese . They were trying to make a machine . That could think like a man . The experiments failed . The human subjects went insane and died . Yeah . Well ! John has got the crazy part down . Does he have any weaknesses ? Matter coheres using a magnetic field . Disrupting that field may trap him . Right ! But if he can cure . Negative . His body replaced on a cellular level . There is no cure . - You do not know that ! - Reese . No ! I am not going to let a machine tells me what is possible ! You said all the other subjects died . Right ? Well ! That means John is one of a kind . He is unique ! All right ? There is no way of knowing . What he is capable to do ? You are right . That is what makes him so dangerous ! John is not humanity last hope anymore . He is Sky Net . It is a shame you will not take a more public role . In the company . John . Danny is the best there is . Even he cannot decipher some of the enhanced code . You have integrated into Genisys . I just know how it works . Cyberdyne owes you . John . I owe you . Miles your faith in me is payment enough . You have funded the RD . You have taken the chances on my ideas for the last three years . The potential applications for polyglot are countless . Your robotics work is revolutionary . You were a good investment . I appreciate it . - What ? - Phew ! Let us hope it is enough to pay for this Holy Grail you got me chasing . Well ! The quantum field generator works . Yeah . That and nothing else . You cannot crack it . John . Maybe it just cannot do . " What do we want ? " Time travel . - " And when do we want it ? " - It is irrelevant . Yeah . Good thing , too . We are years away from making this thing work . When we do ... Boom ! Boom ! Tomorrow is over . Thanks to all of you . When that countdown hits zero . Cyberdyne will revolutionize technology with the ultimate killer app . Genisys . I am here to tell you that ... Our preordains as of this afternoon have reached one billion users . We are creating the dawn of a new age . Where every single piece of technology you own . Will be seamlessly linked . And now , before we wrap this up . The child that you all helped bring into this world . Has something to say . Genisys ? I cannot wait to meet you tomorrow . We will change the future together . Let us see how we are doing . Do not worry . I will not let them hurt you . Thirty years ! You had one place to be . Where were you ? Stuck in traffic . My dad used to bring me here when I was a little . There are whole rooms those abandoned . That is why I told Pops to use it . You got weapons down there . Weapons , supplies , tactical gear , clothing . Including pants . Kyle Reese . Was that a joke ? Can he make jokes ? I guess the long way pays off . We are on the clock . Thirty minutes . Old . Not obsolete . Not yet . All done . What are with you two ? Server rooms are here . Charges in these five points . Will be sufficient to destroy the entire campus . We get in , put the explosives . We get out before they blow . Our strategy did not account for John Connor . I did not foresee him . Now he knows what we are planning because we just told him . What do we do when ? He comes after us . These weapons will have a little effect on John Connor . MRI sure affected him . Great ! All we need is a magnet the size of a truck . You got one of them lying around . Theoretically . Wait here . Well ! His small talk has not improved . You should told me . That we have a son . That John Connor is not my son . Yeah . You knew . I mean ! You do not think you should . I do not know . Maybe say something . You will die . All right ? What ? You die . That is what happens . We fall in love . You are father of John . Then , in less than 48 hours . You die protecting me . You want to tell me how , that conversation is supposed to start . You lied to me . - You manipulated me . - I lied . From the moment , John found you . He manipulated you . Because he needed to ensure his existence . John lied to you for years . I lied to you for two days . You know . It was not all about him . All right ? If John went down . The Resistance went down with him . He could tell you ! So ! What are you saying ? That I know how it feels to have no choices . Only one road you can go down . Because otherwise all of it . Everything is gone . I have just known it longer than you have . Well ! John did not manipulate me to fall in love with you . I did that on my own . If you love me , you die , and I do not . I do not know which one is worse . Sarah . We cannot . Just look at what John has become . What if that is what happens ? What if that is what always happens if we are together . You said : You would follow me to the ends of the Earth . Why will not you follow me now ? How did he find us ? I never told anyone about this place , only Pops . Mom . I did honestly think . I would not remember . The place you spent so much time with Grandpa . Shoot first . The mother I remember would be proud . She ... You ... Taught me everything . I know you . Who are you ? What will you do ? You cannot run from me . I will always find you . John fights this ! It does not have to go down this way ! There is a momentum to time . Kyle . Things that want to happen . Like I always survive . You always die . Alternatively ... You can fight with me . Kyle . Like we always have . There is a storm coming . It will not stop . It has to be . You know what will happen . You know better than anyone does ! I cannot bargain with it . I cannot reason with . John . Please ! I do not feel pity , or remorse , or fear . John . Please ! I absolutely will not stop ever . Until Sky Net rules this world . Rule this . Pops ! Are you ... You ? As a T-800 . I lack the mimetic skills to appear as anyone else . It is he . Let us go . Come on ! Sarah Connor seat belt . What is that supposed to do ? Disrupt John Connor magnetic coherence field . His particles will not be able to scatter . Theoretically . I hate it when he says that . Where is he ? I cannot see him ! Suspects fled barracks in a stolen school bus . Considered armed and extremely dangerous . Sixteen-Mary-David . Code three on suspects . Pops ! Nice to see you . Get out . The brakes are gone ! Shit ! Where is he ? Do you see him ? Reese ! Are you all right ? Yeah ! Never better . Let me see your hands ! Reese ! Take my hand ! Hurry ! Hands up ! Let me see your hands now ! Get your hands up ! Hands where we can see them ! You cannot wound them all before they would kill us . I am 14 rounds short of an acceptable success margin . Those odds suck . Stand down . Down on your knees . Let us go . Get down ! Get down ! You cannot hold us here . You had enough weapons to invade the Sudan . We call that probable cause . What for are these ? I use them to find my keys . No one likes a smart-ass . Son . Did not your mother teach you that ? My mom was Irish . So she encouraged my smart-ass . I have never seen him before . How about you folks ? You know this man . No . He looks familiar . His kind of looks like you . Dad . They are here . Sir . Okay ! If you would not mind waiting in the conference room . I will just be a couple of minutes . Thanks . Kyle . You do not talk much . Do you ? So ! Who is Lurch ? I have no idea . We are not even sure he speaks English . Witnesses say you were fighting with a man on the bridge . Agents . Listen to me . - My name is O 'Brien . - No ! Hell , no ! I have been working this case for 33 years . - What do you want ? A medal ! - Hey ! Sit down ! Oh ! Shit ! He is looking right at you . That is impossible . He cannot see through ... Wait ! Wait , and wait ! Why are they always trying to kill you ? I want to help you . I do . I think . I have to understand . I know what is going on here has to be complicated . We are here to stop the end of the world . I can work with that . Kyle ! Get back here ! Sarah ? Get Reese . I am right behind you . - Get in your car and go . - Okay . Kyle ! Kyle . Kyle . You can do this . A straight line . You just go , and you do not look back . Got it ? Find him . Go ! That is yours , too , I believe . Nice to see you . Pops . Load up . Liquefied magnetic shotgun shells . Magnetic Rifle Entry Munition . That is the new breacher . Big blast , no shrapnel . Blows a door clean off . You know , for people who cannot do those them . Take it . Let us go . You can fly . Right ? Yeah . John taught me . I will tell them you took a car . And headed to south . Thank you . Run away . Hang on ! Which way is Cyberdyne ? Head to the Bay Bridge , then southeast . You have to get him off me ! Cyberdyne . The manufacturing , research buildings . Are all below ground . He is gaining on us ! All right ! Sarah . I need you to back off him . So I can get above him . Pops . When I do that . Can you take him out ? I can . Okay ! Hold on ! You got this . - I will be back . - What ? Call in ! Call in ! Police . Fire , everybody . Do it ! Come on ! Come on ! Pick up the phone , damn it . Mr. Connor ? Sorry . Doug , but I 'm afraid I cannot have any witnesses . Security Control . State your password and emergency . Security code : Zulu-Bravo - Foxtrot-0-0-2-8 . False alarm . You have a nice night . He is okay . He may be at the bottom of the lake . He is okay . What about John ? I think he is doing just fine . Do you see him ? No . You can bet he sees us . I know who you are . John told me . You want to destroy me . You are a Sky Net . I am becoming a Sky Net . You are not a child . I know what you are . What you are going to do . - What I am going to do ? - You came here to kill me . You are too late . Ask him . That is all people know how to do . Kill what you do not understand . There are not enough bullets in the world to kill me . John Connor talks too much . Follow me . The timer . It sped up . Why ? Sky Net is evolving . We no longer have hours . It will be able to upload much sooner . Each time it ages , the clock speeds up . This way . Wait ! You have been here before . I was able to infiltrate the work crews in this facility . You got a job in construction . Until I lay , off . What the hell ? John has a time machine . Not yet . Only the magnetic quantum field is complete . At the rate the counter is going . We will never clear out in time . Then we blow it anyway . There is an alternative . I was able to program your voice and hand print . Into the biometric security system . There is a safe room on the lowest level . That we can access to survive the blast . What about that ? Is it dangerous ? Poly alloy requires programming to take permanent form . Without the CPU . It is harmless . How long ? Sky Net will upload in eleven minutes . We split up . Stay in contact . Let us move . Humankind pays lip service to peace . It is a lie . Therefore , you are final solution is to kill us all . I do not think so . The countdown jumped again . We are down to eight minutes . I will not allow this . What are you going to do ? Talk us to death . You do not even have a body . You only have one detonator . You cannot win . I have company ! Give me the detonator ! Do it , Pops ! Do it now ! I cannot . I cannot kill Sarah Connor . You have to do it ! I order you ! He cannot . Neither cans me . Because if you die . He definitely hits that button . Sarah ! Sarah ! The detonators destroyed . There has to be another way . Come on ! No , Pops ! No ! No ! No ! Pops ! No ! I understand how to control this place . I understand many things now . You need to understand . You have lost . Not yet . We have not . Come on ! Shaped charge . Big enough to get us in . Small enough to kill us . You have a plan . Right ? Theoretically . What was it you said ? " I do not think so " ? John ! No . That thing attacked John . I did not attack John . I saved him . Primates evolve over millions of years . I evolve in seconds . I am here . In exactly four minutes . I will be everywhere . You are nothing but a relic from a deleted timeline . This is pointless . I am inevitable . - Go ! - My existence is inevitable . Why cannot you just accept it ? Because we are human . You were never strong enough to defeat me . Not alone . John ? Stop . Now . When will you ever learn ? Now , Sarah ! Kyle Reese ! Activate the field generator . No , Pops , not with you inside . You know what will happen . Pops ... Pops . Please ! Please ! Pops ! Sky Net is almost free . I cannot hold John Connor much longer . Kyle Reese protects my Sarah . No ! No ! No ! No . Pops . No ! No ! Pops ! No ! - No ! - Sarah ! It is the only way . Come on ! Scanning . Identify yourself . Sarah Connor . We have to get out of here . We have to find him . Sarah . He is gone . - He is ... - Dead ? Yeah ! I know that . I mean ! We leave no part of him behind . It is too dangerous . He loved you . Anyone who loves me ... All of them ... They die . Not all of them . Not this time . You need to understand . That Sky Net is gone . You are free . For the first time . You can choose the life you want . Any life you want . What if I do not know how . Well ! Since we are about to run out of air . I would say you do not need to worry about it . Hello ! Sarah Connor . Pops ! I thought you were dead . No . Just upgraded . What about John ? His constituent parts could not have survived the blast . That means there is only one thing left to do . Easy ! Boy . What is it ? Kyle . What are you doing here ? A friend of mine really needs to talk to you , If that is okay . Yeah . I guess so . Thank you . I like her . Yeah . I am too . Now , this is going to sound kind of strange . There is something I need you to remember . A message . Whom do I tell ? Yourself . Repeatedly . Are you ready ? It goes like this . Remember : Genisys is Sky Net . Kyle Reese is a good man . He is . So what now ? You were right . I can choose . You know that is disturbing . Right ? You will get used to it . And it was over . Sky Net was gone . And now one road has become many . Though questions remain . We will search for the answers together . But one thing we know for sure . The future is not set . TERMINATOR GENISYS Review . Synchronization by Angel .

 I made you this . Um , I made you this . I been trying to make contact for years . They still don 't want me . You have a little ... You got some information on Jonathan Walsh ? Let me grab a pen . Subject number 28409 ... I 'm hearing there 's a wrinkle ? - I 'm on it . - Good . Because if you can 't handle it , we will . I 've pored over hundreds of cryptic police reports and discovered a distinct pattern . Based on average temperature , the Earth 's angle to the sun , and Beacon 's longitude and latitude ... I 've accurately predicted the day , within a window of 2 1 / 2 hours , when the next visitation will take place . According to my data , nobody who 's ever been taken on that day has ever come back , and guess when that day is . - Today ! - Today ? And guess who 'll be there to greet them . - Me ! - You ? So ... I thought I 'd ... give you some stuff to remember me by . You know what ? Thanks , Gerry , but why don 't you hold on to it ? I mean , you 're comin back anyway , right ? No ! Didn 't you listen to anything I just said ? - Not really . - This is a full-time gig . I 'm gonna be like the ambassador of the human race . That 's why I quit my toll-booth job . Wait . What ? You quit your job ? No , Gerry , don 't quit your job to go chasing aliens . - That 's what you did . - Fair point , but I 'm a cautionary tale , man , not a shining example of what to do . That 's easy for you to say . You 're a member of the group . I 'm just a pity member . You 're not a pity member . You 're ... a valuable component . I 'm a mascot . You 're a full-fledged member . Got your stripes . - I can see you made up your mind . - Yeah . I have . You can come with me , buddy . No , no , no , no , no , no . I 'm-I 'm actually gonna stay here . I 've got some real work that I can do , you know , a real story with real facts . I been chasing a little too long without anything to show for it . Okay , yeah . Whatever , it 's cool . But just so you know ... Bigfoot 's real . - Is he ? - Is she ? - And yes . - I 'll write that down . Well , I guess this is it . I 'm gonna miss us . It 's been an honor being your best friend . Yep . Bring it in , big guy . Okay . All right . Safe travels . I 'll see ya tomorrow , Gerry . Astronaut ice cream . Check . Sativa seeds . Check . Dramamine . Check . Passport . Check . Family photo . Check . Hello ? Gerry ... is that you ? Yeah , sorry . I butt-dialed you . Be there in a second , Mom . Sorry , I gotta go . Mom stuff . Okay . There you go . I left some room in your coffee for cream . Have a super-terrific day . Welcome , valued customer . Hey . What can I get y ... - Well , what do you w ... - I 'll take a flat white . A-and while I 'm here , um , just wanted to apologize for how I spoke to you . I ... was a bit of a jerk . No . I was a jerk . I didn 't respect your boundaries . I was a nosey-pants . And after our interaction , I reflected a lot on male privilege . You did ? I 'm so sorry on behalf of all men . What are you doing later ? Do you wanna grab a drink ? No one ever asks me if-if I want a drink . S-so is that a yes ? Yeah . Yes a thousand times . Hi , this is Ozzie Graham . I 'm calling from the " Beacon Gazette " to follow up on a story that I 'm working on about the senator 's possible connection to Glint Enterprises ? Yeah , I can hold . This is Jonathan . You 've got a problem . They want you to get a donut . What ? Why ? I just got a donut . I don 't want another one . It 's not a request . It 's Ozzie . He 's connecting the dots . He called Pelosi 's office . They 're pissed . Aw , damn it . Okay , push the donut meeting . Stall them as along as you can . I don 't care what you tell them . And set up a lunch with Ozzie . Gyah ! Gerry ... this is all your alien research . This is ... this is your life 's work . I-I can 't ... take this . You 're the only one I trust to keep it out of the wrong hands . I 'll guard it with my life . But ... are you ready to do this ? Yeah . I 've never been readier . You crazy son of a bitch . You 're braver than I am . I am kinda brave , aren 't I ? Kinda like a hero . Definitely . Gerry ? You give those bastards hell . Gosh , sorry ! Sorry . Hey , Ron ! Safety first , okay ? So , how 's " Beacon " ? Good , good . You writing any interesting stories ? Yeah , the azalea festival just started up . There 's 17 different species of azalea that were entered this year . Is that why you called Nancy Pelosi 's office ? I 'm guessing you don 't wanna talk about azaleas . You 're goddamn right I don 't . Is this about the expos√© I 'm writing ? After all I 've done for you . Been a weird boss ? - Been a confidant . - No . - A mentor . - No . Why are you doing this ? People deserve to know the truth . You want the truth ? You should have just asked . Yeah , Jonathan , I would like the truth . The truth is , I 'm a lizard person and I 'm part of a global conspiracy to undermine the human race . Isn 't that what your little alien support group believes ? What are they called , SpaceLosers ? The group of which you 're an active member ? So that 's your big plan ? You 're gonna expose me and ... undermine my credibility ? Well , I don 't have to . Just like you don 't have to write this article about Glint . Should we get some " brusketta " ? You know what ? I 'm gonna take a pass on the bruschetta , as most people call it . And if you wanna out me as an alien guy , go ahead . I 'll take my chances . - Really ? ' Cause I will . - Fine . - I will ! - Do it ! - Okay ! - All right , then . You have fun doing that . But just so you know , we prefer to be called " experiencers . " Hey , who do I have to to get some " brusketta " over here ? - What ? - They want to see you now . - When ? - Like an hour ago . God damn it ! - Hey , Yvonne . - Hey . I 'm returning your foot bath . Great . Thank you . W ... I also w-wanted to tell you something . Yeah , sure . Come in . Watch out for that tripwire . Yeah . Sorry . I had the whole place booby-trapped after I had to deal with all that alien bullshit . Wow . You 're not foolin ' around . You come into my house uninvited , you 've messed with the wrong person . Okay , so ... You know the day when we were in the truck driving around on the investigation ? That was a good day . Right ? So ... that 's what you came here to tell me , Gerry ? No . Yeah . I won 't keep you . I just wanted to say that I-I-I really , really like you , I kinda have a crush on you , and I think about you a lot . And I 'll think about you when I 'm up there . Okay . I 'm gonna go . Gerry . Yeah ? Wow ! - That was totally ... - Don 't stop . Yeah , more . Are you sure that we haven 't met before ? You look so familiar . Are you like , from ... Have you been in Pittsburgh ? No , I-I just moved here from ... Iceland . You just have a face , maybe , that , like , is really recognizable . Do you wanna dance ? Wow . You really dance . Thank you . Just move around a lot . Okay . That 's a secret to good dancing . That shoulder thing is cool . Do that ... - Yeah ? - Yeah , you got it ! Yeah ! What are these called ? They 're , strawberry daiquiris . - They 're so good . - Yeah . - They 're so ... they 're so good . - Do you like those ? You like those ? Yeah . Slow down . - W ... - Yeah . Ooh ! Ooh , what 's going on ? It 's a brain freeze . - My head ... - You 're okay . No , it 's not okay ! It 'll only be a second , and it 'll be gone in a second . Ahhhhh . It 's gone . - Yeah . - Wow , that was ... that was something . You never had a brain freeze before ? I never had a daiquiri before . Yeah . I-I 'm sorry , um , I-I 'll pay for that . Sir , this is totally my fault . I was sitting way too close to the spill . I 'm gonna help you clean this up . - No , no problem . - No , Don . No , he wouldn 't ... Thank you . We accept your offer to pay for the drinks . Thank you . Subject 28409 seems to be asking a lot of questions . Now , Elon 's office called ... and Bono 's . They 're all a little nervous . We warned you once . You didn 't handle it . You 're gonna handle it now . I 'm not really a gun guy . Well , you don 't have to use a gun . I don 't care what you use . Just ... get it done . Poison is really popular . Is this really necessary ? He 's closing in on a network of undercover reptilians . But he doesn 't know that . If you can 't handle this , just say so . I 'll mark you down as non-compliant , and ... No . Are you okay ? Why aren 't you playing ? I 'm scared . Of me ? Hey . Don 't be scared . I 'm not gonna hurt ya . You promise ? Yeah . I promise . Classic . My God . What do you want ? This 'll be quick . Can I come in ? Look , if you 're gonna expose me , expose me , all right ? Here . You want some more stuff ? When I was 5 , I peed the bed . Look . I 'm not gonna lie . You 're a huge pain in my ass right now . But I 'm not gonna expose you . Because this thing between you and me has to end . - Here . - What 's this ? It 's everything you need to know about Glint Enterprises and our cover-ups ... who 's involved , where the money went . This could ruin you . Yeah , it might . Ozzie , do you believe in karma ? - No . - Me neither . But I do believe I might be getting what I deserve . Well , thanks for ... all this . Why are you smiling ? I don 't know . I guess it just feels good to be ... doing real work again . Feels like my feet are finally on the ground . Good . That 's good . Wow . Maybe I should get going . Yeah ... yeah , I-I guess . Do you want me to give you a ride ? Naw , it 's okay . Gas prices ... No ! It 's cool , Gerry . - I 'll go get my keys . - I don 't wanna put you out , though . It 's all the way across town . Look , Gerry ... we just had sex , so I can give you a ride . Cool . Wanna have sex again ? Psst . - The window 's open , Gerry . - I just wanted to let you know you won 't have to worry about me anymore . - You leaving town ? - You could say that . You 're flying somewhere . You could say that . What are we doin ' here , Gerry ? Okay , man , we 'll keep the charade going . But we know who you really are . I 'm not an alien , Gerry . Nobody said anything about alien . You just did . You just mouthed the word " alien . " - Did I ? - Yeah . - Gun it , Yvonne ! - No , Gerry , I 'm not . It 's a red light . It is a red light . Don 't gun it . Hi . We just wanted to say thank you for your service tonight . It was great . And , you-you forgot to take the drinks off the bill . I did ? I-I 'm sorry . I 've just been so slammed all night . - I 'll take care of that right away . - Okay , thank you . Thank you so much . You 're the nicest person . If you ever come by the Remarkable Bean , I 'll buy you a complimentary coffee . N-no . No , I won 't . At first , I-I felt nauseous , but then ... the nausea kinda gave way to ... empowerment . That 's right . Well , it should feel good , you know ? It 's like you were pregnant with your own self-confidence and now you 're giving birth . This is me . Okay ... Good night . - You left him alive ? - Yep . You know this means we 'll have to eliminate both of you ? I don 't think so . Here 's how I see it . You can 't kill Ozzie , because his article just went to the paper , and if he ended up dead now , it would look awfully suspicious . And you can 't kill me , because if you do , there 'll be no one left to enter the deactivation code for the files . What files ? You don 't know about the files ? Ooh . I should have led with that . They 're the files that contain everything about our reptilian mission , our identities ... all of it . If I don 't enter a code every 12 hours , they leak straight to the Internet ... boom . Why sacrifice all this for a human ? I have my reasons . You feelin ' better ? Yeah . What are you drawing ? I made this . That 's you . You drew me ? Why ? You made me not be scared . You 're my friend . You like it ? Yes . Well , you 've made your choice , traitor . Enjoy living among the humans without your wealth or status or power . Well , if there 's one thing I 've learned from being on Earth , it 's that a good-looking white guy with an Ivy League education will always land on his feet . Good luck , Gerry . Luck 's got nothin ' to do with it . The aliens have not arrived yet , but spirits are still high . There 's an electricity in the air . Note to self ... Remember to ask the aliens if they did Stonehenge . Here we go . Any minute now . So we don 't ... think ... it , you know , happened , right ? Who knows , man ? It happened to us . That 's a good point . - Ooh , Gerry . - Hi , guys . - Hey . - Gerry . Gerry , it 's good to see ya . Musta got my date wrong . You know what ? Those were some tricky calculations . Yeah . A-and it was also a leap year . - Yeah ! - It was , wasn 't it ? - That 's it . - Yeah , maybe . - That 's really it . - Who knows , Gerry ? Maybe the aliens got the date wrong , and you were right . Yeah . I just ... I fell asleep at one point . What if they got one look at me and just left ? No . Absolutely not . You know better than anyone that 's not how it goes . Their loss is our gain . Yeah , it 's good to have you back , man . Sorry you had such a hard night , buddy . It wasn 't all bad . - Where have you been ? - None of your business . Maybe you should take a chill pill . What did you say to me ? I 'm asserting myself . Deal with it . Please . Thank you . We missed a scheduled pickup yesterday ! Now we have to wait who knows how long till the right atmospheric readings ! We 're gonna be even more behind ! Do you even care ? Don ! No ! The Mainstation is coming . The what ? The main ship is ... I thought ... when ? Now you care . Well , I wouldn 't worry . You and your big balls will handle it . - I mean , come on , right ? - I ... I 'm surprised you didn 't knock me out when you walked into the room . You and your big , gigantic pendulum dick ! Just swingin ' in the wind ?

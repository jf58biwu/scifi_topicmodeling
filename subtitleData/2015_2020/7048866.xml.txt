I 'm all in on this . - I can lose my house ! - I 'm sorry , sir . There 's nothing I can do . Maybe next time , don 't overextend yourself . What 'd you say ? Yeah . He 's right . I overextended myself . Put them down . If you have a grievance , you may take it up with my superiors . Your superiors ? Who the hell are they ? ! The joint venture between Stark Industries and the federal government , the Department of Damage Control , will oversee the collection and storage of alien and other exotic materials . So now the assholes who made this mess are getting paid to clean it up ? - Yeah , it 's all rigged . - Experts estimate there are over 1,500 tons of exotic materials scattered throughout the Tristate area . Hey , Chief , we still have another load from yesterday . - We 're supposed to turn this in , right ? - I ain 't hauling it . It 's too bad . We could 've made some pretty cool stuff from all that alien junk . I tell you what . Let 's keep it . The world 's changing . It 's time we change , too . Here you go , Mason . Business is good . New York , Queens . It 's a rough borough , but hey , it 's home . - Who are you talking to ? - No one . - Just making a little video of the trip . - You know you can 't show it to anyone . - Yeah , I know . - Then why are you narrating in that voice ? - Hmm . Because it 's fun . - " Fun " . So , uhh , why do they call you " Happy " ? Come on . I 'm not carrying your bags . Let 's go . Hey , should I go to the bathroom before ? - There 's a bathroom on it . - Woah , no pilot ? That 's awesome ! - Is that where you 're gonna sit ? - Yeah . - Is it your first time on a private plane ? - It 's my first time on any plane . Should it be making that noise ? No one has actually told me why I 'm in Berlin . Or what I 'm doing . Something about , Captain America going crazy ... - This is you . - Oh , we 're neighbors ? We 're not roommates . Suit up . - Okay , Peter . You got this . - What the hell are you wearing ? - It 's my suit . - Where 's the case ? What case ? That 's not my- - what ? I thought that was a closet . This is still my room ? My room is way bigger than I ... Hey , I found the case . " A minor upgrade " ? Woah ! Oh , my God ! Put it on . This is the coolest thing I 've ever seen , ever ! - Let 's go ! - But , I don 't understand , is-- - is it for me ? Happy , Happy , wait ! This is insane ! Insane ! Look at this thing ! Look at the eyes ! - This is the greatest day of my life . - Let 's go . Okay . There 's Captain America , Iron Man , Black Widow ... - Woah , who 's that new guy ? - Underoos ! That 's me ! I gotta go , I gotta go ! Hey , everyone . Okay , so the craziest thing just happened , right ? I just had a fight with Captain America and I stole his shield , and I threw it at him , and I ... What the hell ... He 's big now ! I gotta go . Hang on . It was , the most amazing thing that 's ever happened . So Mr. Stark 's like : " Hey , Underoos ! " And I just sort of flipped in , and I stole Cap 's shield , and I was like , " Hey , what 's up , everybody ? " Hey , just a second . Coming . - Hey ! - We have thin walls here . - What are you doing , a little video diary ? - Yeah . - It 's alright . - I told him not to do it . He was filming everything . Hey , hey , hey ... You know what , we should make an alibi video for your aunt , anyway . You ready ? Okay . Get in the frame . Hey , May . How are you doing ? What are you wearing ? Something skimpy , I hope . Peter , that 's inappropriate . Let 's start over . We can edit it . 3 , 2 , 1 . Hey , May ! My gosh ... Wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did ... this weekend at the Stark Internship retreat . - Everyone was impressed . - Come on ! - It 's a friggin ' merge , I 'm sorry . - This , ' cause you 're not on Queens Boulevard . See , Happy is hoping to get bumped up to Asset Management . He was forehead of security . And before that , he was just a driver . That was a private conversation . I don 't like joking about this . It was hard for me to talk to you about that ... - No seriously , was he snoring aboard the plane ? - Okay , here we go ... - Happy , can you give us a moment ? - You want me to leave the car ? I want you to grab Peter 's case out of the trunk . I can keep the suit ? Yes , we were just talking about it . Do me a favor , though ... Happy 's kinda your point guy in this . Don 't stress him out . Don 't do anything stupid . I 've seen his cardiogram . - All right ? - Yes . Don 't do anything I would do . And definitely don 't do anything I wouldn 't do . There 's a little gray area in there and that 's where you operate . - Wait , does that mean that I 'm an Avenger ? - No . - He 's at ? - Seventh floor . - I can take that up . You don 't have to take it . - You 're gonna take it ? - Yeah . I can take that . - Thank you . - So , when 's our next , " retreat " , you know ? - What ? Next mission ? - Yeah , the mission , the mission . - We 'll call you . - Well did you have my number ? - No , I mean we 'll call you . Like , someone will call you . Alright ? That 's not a hug , I 'm just grabbing the door for you . We 're not-- - we 're not there yet . Bye ! They 're gonna call me . What 's up , Penis Parker ? - Rise and shine , Midtown Science and Technology . - Students , don 't forget about your homecoming tickets . - Do you have a date for homecoming ? - Thanks , Jason , but I already have a date . - Okay . - Yep . You , in my office , right now ! Join me , and together , we 'll build my new Lego Death Star . - What ? ! - So lame . No way , that 's awesome ! How many pieces ? 3,803 . - That 's insane . - I know ! - You wanna build it tonight ? - I can 't tonight . I got the Stark internship . - Stark internship . - Yeah , exactly . - Boy 's got that internship . - Hopefully , soon it 'll lead to a real job . That would be so sweet . He 'd be all , " Good job on those spreadsheets , Peter . Here 's a gold coin . " - I don 't know how jobs work . - That 's exactly how they work . I 'll knock out the basic bones of the Death Star at my place , and then I 'll come by afterwards . Because for the most part , the difficult thing will be just the base of it . The top half will ... . That 'd be great . Okay , so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points A and B ? Flash . It 's the product of sine of the angle and gravity , divided by the mass . Nope . Peter . Are you still with us ? Uh , yeah . Yeah . Uhh ... Mass cancels out , so it 's just gravity times sine . Right . See , Flash ? Being the fastest isn 't always the best if you are wrong . You 're dead . Today we 're gonna be talking about Danish physicist Neils Bohr . But trust me , there 's nothing " Bohr-ing " about his discoveries regarding quantum theory . Did Liz get a new top ? No . We 've seen that before , but ... - never with that skirt . - Liz ! Hey ! That looks so good . We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy , though . Too late . You guys are losers . - Then why do you sit with us ? - ' Cause I don 't have any friends . Let 's move to the next question : What is the heaviest naturally occuring element ? Hydrogen 's the lightest . That 's not the question . Ok . - Uranium . - That is correct . Thank you , Abraham . Please open your books to page 10 . Peter , it 's nationals . Is there no way you could take one weekend off ? I can 't go to Washington because if Mr. Stark needs me , - then I have to make sure I 'm here . - You 've never even been in the same room as Tony Stark . - Wait , what 's happening ? - Peter 's not going to Washington . - No , no , no , no , no . - Why not ? Really ? Right before nationals ? You already quit marching band and robotics lab . I 'm not obsessed with him . I 'm just very observant . Flash , you 're in for Peter . Oof . I don 't know . I gotta check my calendar first . - I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up . - That is false . What did I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes ? - Hey , what 's up ? - Hey , man . - What 's up , Mr. Delmar ? - Hey , Mr. Parker . Number five , right ? Yeah , and with pickles . And can you squish it down real flat ? - Thanks . - You got it , boss . - How 's your aunt ? - She 's all right . - You know what ? $ 10 . - It 's $ 5 ! - For that comment , $ 10 . - Hey . Come on , I 'm joking . I 'm joking . Here 's $ 5 . What 's up , Murph ? How you doing , buddy ? - How 's school ? - Y 'know . It 's boring . I got better things to do . Stay in school , kids . Stay in school . Otherwise , you 're gonna end up like me . - This is great . - Best sandwiches in Queens . Finally . Hey , could you hold this for a second ? Thanks . Hey , is this anybody 's bike ? No ? - Hey , buddy , is this your bike ? - No change . Does anyone have a pen , do you have a pen ? Everybody good ? Hey , you 're that Spider-guy on YouTube , right ? - Call me Spider-Man ! - Okay , Spider-Man . Do a flip ! - Yeah ! - Not bad . - You shouldn 't steal cars . It 's bad . - It 's my car , dumbass ! - Hey ! Shut that off ! - I was just trying to-- - - Yo ! I work at night , come on , dude ! - That 's not your car . That 's his car . How was I supposed to know it 's his car ? What 's he doing with the window ? Everyday with these damn alarms . Turn it off . Don 't make me come down there , you punk . - Hey , Gary ! How you doing ? - Marjorie ! How are you ? How 's your mother ? I 'm good . I 'm good . You have reached the voice mailbox of Happy Hogan . Hey , Happy . Here 's my report for the night . I stopped a grand theft bicycle . I couldn 't find the owner so I just left a note . I helped this lost , old Dominican lady . She was really nice and bought me a churro . I just , feel like I could be doing more , you know . I 'm just curious when our next real mission 's gonna be . So yeah , just call me back . It 's Peter . Parker . Why would I tell him about the churro ? Finally , something good . Yo , this high tech stuff makes it too easy . - Told you it was worth it . - Go , go , go ! Woah . Nice . We can hit like 5 more places tonight . What 's up , guys ? Forgot your PIN number ? You 're the Avengers ! What are you guys doing here ? Thor . Hulk . Good to finally meet you guys . Thought he 'd be more handsome in person . Iron Man ! What are you doing robbing banks ? You 're a billionaire . This feels so weird ! What is that thing ? I 'm starting , to think , you 're not , the Avengers ! 911 , what 's your emergency ? Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers in a bank on 21st street . Alright , guys . Let 's wrap this up , it 's a school night . So how did jerks like you get tech like this ? Mr. Delmar . Hey , Mr. Delmar , you in here ? Is anybody in here ? Hello ? Oh , come on . I got him ... Here . Okay . Good . Yes . No , no . Put that down . That 's worth more than you or me . - Yeah ? - Happy , the craziest thing just happened to me ! - These guys were robbing an ATM with these high tech weapons , and then ... - Hey , take a breath . Okay ? I don 't have time for ATM , robberies , or the thoughtful notes you leave behind . I have moving day to worry about . Everything 's gotta be out of here by next week . - Wait , wait . You 're moving ? Who 's moving ? - Dude , don 't you watch the news ? Tony sold Avengers Tower . We 're relocating to a new facility upstate , where hopefully , the cell service is much worse . - But what about me ? - What about you ? What if Mr. Stark needs me , or something big goes down ? Can I please just talk to Mr. Stark ? Just stay away from anything too dangerous . I 'm responsible for making sure you 're responsible . Okay ? I am responsible ! Crap ... My backpack 's gone . - That doesn 't sound responsible . - I 'll call you back . Feel free not to . - What was that ? - That 's nothing ! Nothing ! - You 're the Spider-Man . From YouTube . - I 'm not . I 'm not ! - You were on the ceiling ! - No , I wasn 't . Ned , what are you doing in my room ? Aunt May let me in . You said we were gonna finish the Death Star ! You can 't just bust into my room . That turkey meat loaf recipe is a disaster . Let 's go to dinner . Thai , Ned ? - You want thai ? - No . He 's got a thing . A thing to do , after . Okay . Maybe put on some clothes . - She doesn 't know ? - Nobody knows . Mr. Stark knows , ' cause he made my suit . But that 's it . Tony Stark made you that ? Are you an Avenger ? Yeah . Basically . You can 't tell anybody about this . You gotta keep it a secret . - A secret , why ? - If she finds out people try and kill me every single night , she 's not gonna let me do this anymore . - C 'mon Ned . Please . - Okay . Okay , okay , okay . I 'll level with you . I don 't think I can keep this a secret . This is the greatest thing that 's ever happened to me , Peter ! May cannot know . I cannot do that to her right now . You know ? With everything that 's happened with her , I ... Please . Okay . Just swear it . Okay ? - I swear . - Thank you . I can 't believe this is happening right now . - Can I try the suit on ? How 's it work ? - No . - Is it magnets ? How do you shoot the strings ? - I 'm gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow . Okay ? Great . Wait , then ... How do you do this , and the Stark internship ? This is the Stark internship . Just get out . What 's the matter ? I thought you loved larb . It 's too larby ? Not larby enough . How many times do I have to say ' larb ' before , you talk to me ? You know I ' larb ' you . I 'm just stressed . The internship , and I 'm tired . A lotta work . The Stark internship ? I have to tell you ... Not a fan of that Tony Stark . Distracted all the time ... It 's got you in your head . ... in local news , the beloved Queens institution , Delmar Sandwiches was destroyed in an explosion earlier tonight , after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens own colorful , local crime-stopper , the Spider-Man . As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist , a powerful blast was set off , slicing through the bodega across the street . Miraculously , no one was harmed . You spot something like that happening , you turn and you run the other way . Yeah . Of course . - Six blocks away from us ! - I need a new backpack . - What ? - I need a new backpack . That 's a five . - Sticky rice pudding . - Oh , we didn 't order that . - It 's on the house . - Oh . Thanks . That 's nice of him . I think , he ' larbs ' you . You got bit by a spider ? Can it bite me ? It probably wouldn 't hurt , right ? Y 'know what , whatever . Even if it did hurt , I 'll let it bite me . Maybe . How much did it hurt ? The spider 's dead , Ned . You were here ? Yeah . You could 've died . - Do you lay eggs ? - What ? No . - Can you spit venom ? - No . - Can you summon an army of spiders ? - No , Ned . The Sokovia Accords were put into place , and ... How far can you shoot your webs ? Don 't know . Shut up . If I was you , I would stand on the edge of a building and just shoot it as far as I can ... Shut up , Ned . Hi . I 'm Captain America . Whether you 're in the classroom , or on the battlefield ... - Do you know him , too ? - Yeah . We 've met . I stole his shield . Today , my good friend , your gym teacher , will be conducting the " Captain America Fitness Challenge . " Thank you , Captain . I 'm pretty sure this guy 's a war criminal now but whatever . I have to show these videos , it 's required by the state . Let 's do it . Do Avengers have to pay taxes ? What does Hulk smell like ? I bet he smells nice . - Ned , shut up . - Is Captain America cool ? - Or is he like a mean , old grandpa ? - Ned , just shh . Okay ? Hey ... - Can I be your guy in the chair ? - What ? You know how there 's a guy , with a headset , telling the other guy where to go ? Like ... Like if you 're stuck in an apartment building , I could tell you where to go , ' cause there 'd be screens around me ... And I could swivel around them ' cause I 'd be your guy in the chair . - Ned , I don 't need a guy in the chair . - Looking good , Barker . Now see , for me , it would be , F Thor ... Marry Iron Man and kill Hulk . - Well what about the Spider-Man ? - It 's just Spider-Man . And did you guys see that security cam on YouTube ? He fought off 4 guys ! - Oh , my gosh . She 's crushing on Spider-Man . - No way . - Kind of ! - Ugh . Gross . - He 's probably like , 30 . - You don 't even know what he looks like . What if he 's like , seriously burned ? I wouldn 't care . I would still love him for the person he is inside . Peter knows Spider-Man . - No , I don 't . No . I mean ... - They 're friends . Yeah , like Coach Wilson and Captain America are friends . I 've met him . Yeah . A couple of times . But it 's , umm ... Through the Stark internship . Yeah . I 'm not really supposed to talk about it . Well that 's awesome ! Hey , you know what ? Maybe you should invite him to Liz ' party , right ? Yeah , I 'm having people over tonight . You 're more than welcome to come . - You 're having a party ? - Yeah . It 's gonna be dope . You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man . It 's okay . I know Peter 's way too busy for parties anyway , so ... Aw , c 'mon . He 'll be there . Right , Parker ? - What are you doing ? - Helping you out . Did you not hear her ? Liz has a crush on you . Dude , you 're an Avenger . If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl , it 's you . House party in the suburbs ! I remember these . - I 'm kinda jealous ! - It 'll be a night to remember . Aww ... Ned ... Some hats wear men . You wear that hat . Yeah . It gives me confidence . This is a mistake . Hey , let 's just go home . Oh , Peter . I know . I know it 's really hard , trying to fit in . With all the changes your body is going through . It 's flowering now . He 's so stressed out lately . What helps with stress , is going to a party . And you should have a party . Yeah . I 'm gonna go . I 'm gonna go . - Peter ! Have fun . Okay ? - I will . Bye , May ! Dude , you have the suit , right ? This is gonna change our lives ! We 're gonna have Spider-Man swing in , say you guys are tight , and then I get ... a fist bump for one of those half bro bumps . I can 't believe you guys are at this lame party . You 're here , too . Am I ? Oh , my gosh . Hey , guys ! Cool hat , Ned . - Hi , Liz ! - Hi , Liz . I 'm so happy you guys came . There 's pizza , and drinks . Help yourself . - What a great party . - Thanks . - My parents will kill me if anything 's broken . I gotta ... - Yeah . - Have fun . - Bye . Dude ! What are you doing ? She 's here . Spider-Man up ! No , no , no . I cannot do this . Spider-Man 's not a party trick . Okay ? Look , I 'm just gonna ... Be myself . - Peter , no one wants that . - Dude . Penis Parker ! What 's up ? So where 's your pal Spider-Man ? Let me guess . He 's stranded with your imaginary girlfriend ? That 's not Spider-Man . That 's just Ned in a red shirt . Hey , what 's up ? I 'm Spider-Man . Just thought I 'd swing by and say hello to my boy Peter . Oh , what 's up , Ned ? Hey , where 's Peter anyway ? He must be over ... God , this is stupid . What am I doing ? What the hell ? Now this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia . Here . You try . Man , I wanted something low-key , like ... Why you tryin ' to outsell me , man ? Ok , ok , ok . I got what you need , alright ? I got tons of great stuff here . One sec . - Okay . I got , black hole grenades , Chitauri rail guns ... - ... Letting off shots in public . No , I hear you . Look , times are changing , and we 're the only ones selling these high tech weapons . This must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff . I just need something to stakeout somebody . I 'm not trying to shoot them back in time . - I got anti-grav climbers ... - You have climbers ? Okay , what the hell was that ? - Did you set us up ? - Hey , hey , man ! Hey , hey . C 'mon ! You 're gonna shoot at somebody , shoot at me ! All right . What was that ? - We gotta call him . - Nah , nah , nah , nah ! - Did you just do it again ? - Shut up ! I 'm calling him . Toomes ' phone . Boss ... Oww . My butt . Great . Guess I 'm gonna have to take a shortcut . Hey , guys . Good game . Have fun . Hey ! Buddy ! Sorry , no time to play . Here . Go fetch ! Now this is more like it ! Smells really good ! Great movie ! Oh , hey guys . - Hey , it 's Peter . Leave a message . - Peter , where are you ? The hat 's not working . This is not cool . Almost got ya ! Thought you 'd get away from me , didn 't you ? I gotcha ! Right where I want you ! Surprise ! What the hell ? Oh . Hey . And then , he 's , he just , like swooped down , like a monster . And he picked me up ... and took me over like 1000 feet and just dropped me . How did you find me ? Did you put a tracker on my suit or something ? I put everything in your suit . Including this heater . - That 's better . Thanks . - What were you thinking ? The guy with the wings is obviously the source of the weapons . I gotta take him down . Take him down now , huh ? - Steady , Crockett . There are people who handle this sort of thing . - The Avengers ? No , no , no . This is a little below their paygrade . Anyway , Mr. Stark . You didn 't have to come all the way out here . I had that . I was fine . Oh , I 'm not ... here . Thank God , this place has Wi-Fi , or you would be toast right now . Thank Ganesh while you 're at it . - Look , forget the flying Vulture guy . Please ! - Why ? Why ? Because I said so ! Sorry . I 'm talking to a teenager . Stay close to the ground . Build up your game , helping the little people . Like that lady that bought you the churro . Can 't you just be like a friendly , neighborhood Spider-Man ? But I 'm ready for more than that now . No , you 're not . That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America . Trust me , kid . If Cap wanted to lay you out , he would have . Listen to me . If you come across these weapons again , call Happy . Are you driving ? You know , it 's never too early to start thinking about college . I got some pull at MIT . End call . - No , I don 't need to go to college , Mr. Stark ... - Mr. Stark is no longer connected . That 's awesome . Stay close to the ground . What is he talking about ? - Hey , man , what 's up ? I 'm on my way back . - Actually , I was calling to say maybe you shouldn 't come . Listen to this . ... When I say " Penis " , you say " Parker " ! Sorry , Peter . I guess we 're still losers . I 'll see you tomorrow . I 'll see you tomorrow in school . Idiots . Idiots . Idiots ! Boss ? Your wife keeps texting you . Something about a brake light ? What 'd I tell you about looking at my phone ? Oh , sorry . You left it out . You know I 'm a curious person by nature . I 've finished designing that high altitude vacuum seal ... In case you wanna , you know , go for the big one ? You 're still on that ? I told you , no . The answer 's no . Forget it ! That was badass . How many times have I told you ... Not to fire them out in the open ? - You said move the merchandise ! - Under the radar . Under the radar ! That 's how we survive . If you bring Damage Control , or the Avengers down here , we 're through . And you 're out there , wearing that goofy thing , lighting up cars ... Calling yourself " The Shocker . " I 'm the Shocker . I shock people . - What is this , pro wrestling ? - Yeah , whatever , old man . C 'mon . Look , look . I know , you don 't give a crap about anything . But I do . I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . You know what ? I can 't afford your bullshit . - Get outta here . - What ? ! - You 're done , you 're off the crew . - Yeah . Alright . I wonder if you can afford me out there ... - With everything I know . - Excuse me ? I 'm just saying ... Maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from . - You know what ? - What ? You 're right . - That work ? - I don 't know . I can 't afford that . Damn ! - I thought this was the anti-gravity gun . - What ? ! No . That 's that one . Here . Now you 're the Shocker . Go out there and find that weapon he lost . Right . - Hey , thanks for bailing on me . - Yeah , well , something came up . - What is that ? - I don 't know . - Some guy tried to vaporize me with it . - Seriously ? - Yeah . - Awesome ! I mean , not awesome . Totally uncool , that guy . So scary . Well look . I think it 's a power source . Yeah , but it 's connected to all those microprocessors . It 's an inductive charging plate . That 's what I use to charge my toothbrush . Whoever 's making these weapons is obviously combining the alien tech with ours . That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said . I just wanna thank you for letting me be a part of your journey , into this amazing ... Keep your fingers clear of the blades . I gotta figure out what this thing is and who makes it . We 'll go to the lab after class and run some tests . First , I say we put the glowy thing in the mass ( ) . First , we gotta come up with a better name than " glowy thingy " . You 're right . Crap ! Come on , come on , come on . High schools creep me out . It 's got this funny smell , you know what I mean ? - That 's one of the guys that tried to kill me . - What ? - We gotta get out of here . - No , no , no . We got to follow them . Maybe they can lead me to the guy that dropped me in a lake . - Someone dropped you in a lake ? - Yeah . It was not good . - Peter . - No . Stay there , Ned . Peter ! - What are you doing ? - Nothing . Yeah . You good ? Chess ? Can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were ? I 'm saying there was an energy pulse right here . There 's no sign of the weapon . I mean , even if it was here , now it 's gone . So are we ... This is so awesome . I know , right . In Brooklyn . Staten Island . Leaving Jersey . They stopped . - Maryland ? - What 's there ? I don 't know , evil lair ? - Evil lair ? - Dude , a gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings , - yeah , they have a lair . - Badass . But , how are you gonna get there if that 's like , 300 miles away ? It 's not too far from DC . - Hey , it 's Peter ! - Guys ! - Yeah , I was hoping maybe I could rejoin the team . - No . No way . You can 't just quit on us , stroll up , and be welcomed back by everyone . Hey , welcome back , Peter ! Flash , you 're back to first alternate . - What ? - He 's taking your place ! Excuse me , can we go already ? 'Cause I was hoping to get in some light protesting in front of one of the embassies before dinner , so ... Protesting is patriotic . Let 's get on the bus . Focus up , everyone . Our next topic is the moons of Saturn . - The second law of Thermodynamics . - Frank Sinatra . - Fort Sumpter . - Flash is wrong . - Okay guys , let 's focus . Next one . - Liz , don 't overwork ' em . - Strontium , Barium , Vibranium . - Very good , Peter . Glad to have you back . Glad to be back . What is the current state of unit ... - Can I take this real quick ? I 'll only be a second . - Yeah , fine . - Hello ? - I got a blip on my screen here . You left New York ? Tracker . Uh , yeah ... No , it 's just a school trip , it 's nothing . Look , Happy ... I gotta say , you tracking me without my permission is a complete violation of my privacy . - That 's different . - What 's different ? Nothing . Look , it 's just the academic decathlon . - It 's no big deal . - Hey . I 'll decide if it 's no big deal . Sounds like it 's no big deal . But remember , I 'm watching you . - Everyone stick together . - Yeah . Are you kidding me ? This place is huge ! - I 've seen bigger . - There 's a bird in here . - Hey , you brought your laptop , right ? - Why ? Peter , why are we removing the tracker from your suit ? Because I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again ... And I don 't really want Mr. Stark to know about it . - So you 're lying to Iron Man now ? - No , I 'm not lying . He just doesn 't really get what I can do yet . Gotcha . Alright , Happy . Enjoy tracking this lamp . There 's a ton of other subsystems in here . But they 're all disabled by the ... " Training Wheels Protocol " . What ? The Training Wheels Protocol ? - Turn it off . - I don 't think that 's a good idea , I mean ... They 're probably blocked for a reason . Come on , man . I don 't need training wheels . I 'm sick of him treating me like a kid all the time . - It 's not cool . - But you are a kid . Yeah . A kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands . Peter , I just don 't think this is a great idea . I mean , what if this is illegal ? Look , please . This is my chance to prove myself . - I can handle it . Ned , come on . - I really don 't think this is a good idea . - But , guy in the chair . - Don 't do that ! Come on . Hey . The glowy thing is evidence . Keep it safe , all right ? Okay . - I 'm moving . - Be careful . - Hey , Liz . - Perfect timing . We 're gonna go swimming . Come on ! Come on . Hey , Peter . I was gonna go study , in the , business center . Peter , you don 't need to study . You 're like the smartest guy I 've ever met . And besides ... A rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale . Um , I read that in a TED talk , so ... I heard it in a TED talk . And I read a coaching book . Are you really , this is really important to you ? Yeah . It 's our future . I 'm not gonna screw it up . And besides , we raided the minibar and these candy bars were like $ 11 . So get your trunks on and come on . - Come on . Come on . - I 'm coming ! - Good evening , Peter . - Hello ? Congratulations on completing your rigorous Training Wheels Protocol . And gaining access to your suit 's full capabilities . - Ah , thank you . - So where would you like to take me tonight ? I put a tracker on someone . He 's a bad guy . Tracker located . Plotting course to intercept target . Okay well , as long as I make it back in time for decathlon , it 's fine . 100 meters from destination and closing . Jump now . Detecting three individuals . Why is their secret lair in a gas station ? That 's so lame . - Hey , suit lady , what are they doing ? - Do you wanna hear what they 're saying ? I can hear what they 're saying ? Uhh , yeah . Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance mode . I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup . The rest is all mine . Whoa . That 's so cool . Can 't believe they 're still cleaning up that Triskelion mess . I love it . They keep making messes , we keep getting rich . - Target inbound . - Whoa , they 're in the middle of a heist . I can catch them all red-handed . This is awesome ! Okay , I 'm gonna get a little closer so I can see what 's happening . Would you like me to engage Enhanced Combat mode ? " Enhanced Combat mode " ? Yeah . - Activating Instant Kill . - No , no , no , no . I don 't wanna kill anybody . Deactivating Instant Kill . Did you hear that ? What the hell just happened ? What was that ? You jumped off the sign and landed on your face . Suit lady , what 's wrong with my web shooters ? Rapid-fire is the default for Enhanced Combat mode . - Why would I need Rapid-fire ? - Would you like to see more options ? You have 576 possible web shooter combinations . - Mr. Stark really overdid it . - You two wait right here . Wait , you 're gonna wanna turn on the dampers or that thing will shatter your arm . - Where 's the dampers ? - That one ! Great choice ! Would you like me to set this as your new default ? - No , no , no ! - Push that in ... - Right here ? - No , no . Yeah , push it . - What was that ? - Taser webs . Taser webs ? I don 't want taser webs . You seem to be very unfamiliar with your web shooter settings . - Would you like to run a refresher course ? - No , just , you choose . - Sure thing . - 6-Alpha-Niner , are you running on time ? Copy , Central . 6-Alpha-Niner , on schedule . - I have a visual . - Green light . Green light . That 's him . Okay . I got eyes on the convoy . Pulling in behing the ( cabooze ) . Deploy anchors . Dropping down . No outgoing distress signals . You 're all clear . Looks like they got some good stuff here . Cool . It 's like some kind of matter phase shifter . All right . Coming up . Hey , big bird ! This doesn 't belong to you ! Oh , God . - Suit lady , what was that ? - You told me to choose . What , no . Just set everything back to normal ! Activating all systems . - Oh . My head . - You appear to have a mild concussion . - So , where am I right now ? - I 'm not sure . The container walls are hindering my sensors . Wait a minute . They must 've hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair . Okay . So maybe we 're gonna have to fight our way out of this one . Three , two , one ! What is this place ? Suit lady , where am I ? You 're in the most secure facility on the eastern seaboard . The Damage Control deep storage vault . No ! Seriously ? The door will most likely remain closed until morning . Morning ? Hey , suit lady . I kinda feel bad calling you " Suit Lady " , you know ? I think I should probably give you a name . Like Liz . No , no , no . God , that 's weird . - What about KAREN ? - You can call me KAREN if you 'd like . Hey , KAREN . What else can this suit do ? What ? Maybe we should run that refresher course . - Ricochet web . - Ricochet web . - Cool . - Stutter web . - Web grenade . - Web grenade ! Should I tell Liz that I 'm Spider-Man ? - Who 's Liz ? - Who 's Liz ? She 's the best . She 's awesome . She 's just a girl who goes to my school . And , yeah . I really wanna tell her , but it 's kinda weird . You know ? - " Hey . I 'm Spider-Man . " - What 's weird about that ? What if she 's expecting someone like Tony Stark ? Imagine how disappointed she 'd be when she sees me . Well , if I were her , I wouldn 't be disappointed at all . Thanks , KAREN . It 's really nice to have somebody to talk to . - Hey , how long have we been here , anyway ? - 37 minutes . What ? 37 minutes ? That 's insane ! I cannot take this anymore . I gotta get out of here . There 's gotta be something in here I can use . Okay , let 's see . Nope . That 's awesome . Hey , it 's like the glowy thing . That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core . - Whoa , you mean we 've been carrying around a bomb ? - It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state . No , no , no , no ! Hey , please ! Please ! Somebody let me out ! Hey ! KAREN you have to help me override that timelock ! - Okay , KAREN , lower the voltage and run it . - Trial unsuccessful . Okay , we 're just gonna have to try every sequence . Ned , Peter , we 're gonna be late . Come on . Let 's go . Okay . Hold on , hold on . Initiating trial 247 . It worked ! It works ! Please be sure all cellphones are turned off . KAREN , you have to get me to the decathlon as fast as possible ! - Sure thing . Just tell me where it is . - It 's right across the street from the Washington Monument . - Hey , it 's Ned . Leave a message . - Ned , call me back ! The glowy thing 's a bomb ! There 's a vehicle approaching on your right . We have now entered sudden death . The next correct answer wins the championship . - Midtown Tech ? - Zero . That is correct . Midtown takes the championship ! - We won ! - Guys , I 'm so proud of you ! Flash , you didn 't answer a single question . Taking it all in , Michelle ? Oh , yeah , I just umm , I don 't really wanna celebrate something that was built by slaves . Oh , I 'm sure the Washington Monument wasn 't built by ... Okay . Enjoy your book . Thanks . - Oh , Ned . You 're alive ! - Peter , are you okay ? - Ned , Ned , where 's the glowy thing ? - Don 't worry . It 's safe . It 's in my backpack . No , Ned ! Listen ! No , Ned ! The glowy thing is dangerous ! You missed the decathlon . I covered for you ... - Ned , listen to me ! - We 're in the Washington Monument . How 're you gonna ... - Peter , is that you ? - Oh , hey , Liz ! - Is that Liz ? - Please put Ned back on the phone . - You should tell her how you feel . - Seriously , you are so lucky we won ! You know , I wanna be mad , but I 'm real worried . Like , what is going on with you ? - Liz , I have to talk to Ned , it 's really important ! - Miss , all items on the belt , please . Liz , there 's something in his backpack that is really dangerous . Don 't let it go through an x-ray . Liz ? Liz ? Dammit ! Hey Mr. Harrington , can I be the one to tell Peter he 's expelled ? The Washington Monument is 555 feet , 5 and one eighth inches tall . ( ) , ( ) , marble and granite are cut around the stone . No , no , no , no ! KAREN , what 's going on up there ? The Chitauri core has detonated and caused severe structural damage to the elevator . - My friends are up there . - What ? ! Uh , don 't worry , ma 'am . Everything 's gonna be okay . Excuse me , excuse me ! Oh my God , that 's tall ! - Oh , my God . Look at the ceiling . - Just stay calm everyone . We are going to die here . Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure . - We 're freaking screwed . - Okay , guys , I know that looks scary , but our safety systems are working . The safety systems are completely failing . - We 're very safe in here . - The occupants are in imminent mortal danger . I 'm going as fast as I can ! You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure . - What ? Why ? - Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate . - How do I get in there ? - Activating Reconnaissance Drone . Whoa . Has that been there this whole time ? That 's awesome ! Locating optimal entry point . - Proceed to southwest window . - KAREN I 'm on my way . Oh , God . Oh , God . Okay . What 's wrong ? You 've reached the southwest window . - Why are you hesitating ? - It 's just I 've never been this high before . You have also not reinstalled your parachute , so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal . Alright . - Why is it not breaking ? - It 's 4 inch ballistic glass . You 'll have to create more momentum . This is DC metro police . Identify yourself . My friends are in there ! Stop ! Return to the ground ! Immediately ! - Okay , who 's next ? - Me ! It 's my turn ! Flash , seriously ? What are you doing ? Don 't worry about the trophy ! Stand down ! Return to the ground immediately ! Return to the ground , or we will open fire ! - Go up , go up ! - I got this . Take my trophy . This is your last chance . I 'm gonna die . I did it ! Hey , how you doing ? Don 't worry about it , I got you . Yes ! Yes ! - Hey , hey , hey ! Big guy , quit moving around ! - I 'm sorry , sir ! So sorry . - You can go . - Okay . All right . This is your stop . Go , go , go . Everybody out . Move it people . Move it . Liz ! You 're okay . You 're okay . - Okay . - Good . Come on up , come on . - Guys , stand back . - I got you . So , is everyone okay ? This is your chance , Peter . Kiss her . Thank you . Are you really friends with Peter Parker ? I can finish the next order , but without any new materials from that truck ... Dammit ... We 're still enough to do the Gargan deal though , right ? Yeah . But then , that 's it . Maybe it 's time that I build the high altitude seal . - Would you shut up about that ? - Look , one job ... No . Eight years . Not a word from the feds . Nothing from those halloween costume - wearing bozos up there in Stark Tower . And then all of a sudden , this little bastard in red tights shows up ... And he thinks he can tear down everything I built . Really ? - I 'm gonna kill him . I 'm gonna find him ... - Found him . The Spider-Man swooped in , heroically saving an academic decathlon team from Queens . The identity of the masked hero is still unknown . Mom ! Peter . Come here ! This past weekend , Midtown 's academic decathlon team defeated the country 's best to win the national championship . Later that day , they also defeated death . Explosives ! Sally screamed ! Flash screamed , everybody screaming ! There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere . It was ( beep ) tight . Just like a Bon Jovi concert . As you know , we made it out alive . And that 's the important thing . I couldn 't bear to lose a student on a school trip . - Not again . - Thankfully , no one was seriously injured . - Thanks to the Spider-Man . - Thank you , Spider-Man . Up next : The Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school . How can you show your Spider spirit ? Dude , dude , dude ... What is it like being famous when nobody knows it 's you ? - Crazy , Ned . - It is crazy ! - Should we tell everyone ? - No . - Should I tell everyone ? - No , dude . That 's not a good idea . - Okay . Well , we 're gonna go to class . - I 'm not going to class . - But you 're already in so much trouble for ditching the decathlon ... - Dude , listen , I figured it out , right ... The wing suit guy is stealing from Damage Control . And what he takes from Damage Control , that 's how he builds the weapons . All I gotta do is catch him ! - But we have a Spanish quiz . - Ned , I 'm probably never gonna come back here . Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate , so ... - when I bring this guy in ... - Dude ! You wanna be a high school dropout ? I am so far beyond high school right now . Parker ! My office . So . You got detention . You screwed up . You know what you did was wrong . The question is , how are you gonna make things right ? Maybe you were trying to be cool . But take it from a guy who 's been frozen for 65 years . The only way to really be cool , is to follow the rules . We all know what 's right . We all know what 's wrong . Next time those turkeys try to convince you that something you know ... Hey , where are you going ? Get back here ! What would Captain America do ? Why are you here ? You don 't even have detention . Oh , I know . I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis . It 's you . So your body 's changing . Believe me , I know how that feels . May ? - Hey , KAREN , what 's up ? - Hey , Peter . How was your Spanish quiz ? Listen , I was wondering if you could help me . I 'm trying to figure out who the guys ... under the bridge were that night , but , I mean I can only kinda remember part of the license plate . I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter . - Footage ? - Yes , Peter . - I record everything you see . - Everything ? - Everything . - Like , all the time ? - It 's called the Baby Monitor Protocol . - Yeah , of course , it is . - Yeah , just roll it back to last Friday . - With pleasure . Hey , everyone ! Yeah , kick - ass party . Hey , what 's up , Liz ? Peter told me a lot about you . No , this is just me messing around . Go later in the day . - It is I , Thor , son of Odin ! - No , no , no . That 's definitely not what we wanna watch . - Your impressions are very funny . - Fast forward to the arms deal . Okay . The two on the right , who are they ? Searching law enforcement databases ... - No records found for two of the individuals . - Nothing ? One individual identified . Aaron Davis , age 33 . - He has a criminal record . And an address here in Queens . - Let 's pay him a visit . Would you like me to activate the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol ? Yeah . Remember me ? I need information and you 're gonna give it to me now ! - Alright , chill ... - Come on ! - What happened to your voice ? - What do you mean , what happened to my voice ? I heard you by the bridge . I know what a girl sound like . I 'm not a girl ! I 'm a boy ! I mean , I 'm a man . - I don 't care what you are . Boy , girl ... - I 'm not a girl ! I 'm a man . Come on , man . Look , who is selling these weapons ? I need to know . Give me names , or else . You ain 't ever done this before , huh ? Deactivate interrogation mode . Look man , these guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous . They can 't just be out on the streets . Look , if one of them can just cut Delmar 's bodega in half ... - You know Delmar 's ? - Yeah . The best sandwich in Queens . - The subhaven 's pretty good . - Nah , it 's too much bread . - I like bread . - Come on , man . Please . Stupid interrogation mode . KAREN , don 't ever do that again . The other night , you told that dude " if you 're gonna shoot somebody , shoot me . " That 's pretty ballsy . I don 't want those weapons in this neighborhood . I got a nephew who live here . Who are these guys ? What can you tell me about the guy with the wings ? Other than he 's a psychopath dressed like a demon ? Nothing . I don 't know who he is , or where he is . I do know where he 's gonna be . - Really ? - Yeah , this crazy dude I used to work with . He 's ... - He 's supposed to be doing a deal with him . - Yes ! Yeah ! Hey . I didn 't tell you where . You don 't have a location . Right . Of course . Yeah . My bad . Silly . Just ... Yeah . Where is it ? Can I give you some advice ? You gotta get better at this part of the job . I don 't understand . I 'm intimidating . - The Staten Island Ferry . 11 : 00 . - Oh , that 's soon . Hey that 's gonna dissolve in two hours . No , no , no , no . Come fix this . - Two hours . You deserve that . - I got ice cream here , man . You deserve that , you 're a criminal . Bye , Mr. Criminal ! Nice . Okay , KAREN . Activate Enhanced Reconnaissance mode . - Sure thing . - He 's out front . Main deck . - I hate this guy . - That 's the guy from the bridge , right ? - Who 's that other guy ? - Just keep me posted . There 's no record of him in my criminal database . Incoming call from May Parker . Shall I reroute to your heads-up display ? I can 't talk right now . I 'll call her back . Hey , Droney . Keep an eye on that guy . We can 't let anybody get away this time . - Who 's the guy on the left ? - Mac Gargan . Extensive criminal record including homicide . Would you like me to activate Instant Kill ? No , KAREN . Stop it with the Instant Kill already ! White pick-up truck . Droney , scan the ship for a white pick-up truck . This is too perfect . They got the weapons , the buyers , and the sellers all in one place . Incoming call from Tony Stark . - No , no , no . Don 't answer ! - Mr. Parker . - Got a sec ? - Uhh , I 'm actually at school . - No , you 're not . - Nice work in DC ... My Dad never really gave me a lot of support . Now I 'm just trying to break the cycle of chain ... - I 'm kind of in the middle of something right now ... - Don 't cut me off when I 'm complimenting you . Anyway . Great things are about to happen ... What is that ? I 'm at band practice ? That 's odd . Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago . - What 's up ? - I got to go . End call ! I 'll take those ! Hey guys . The illegal weapons deal ferry was at 10 : 30 . You missed it . Spider-guy 's here . Whoa , whoa , whoa , not so fast . Are you guys okay ? My bad . That was a little hard . I gotta say , the other guy was way better with that thing . And honestly , I 'm-- - I 'm shocked . Freeze ! FBI ! Get on the ground ! - Wait , what do you mean , FBI ? - The FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation ... I know what the FBI means , but what are they doing here ? Get outta the way ! Get outta the way ! Look out , look out ! Move , move , move ! Get to the top deck . We 're getting out of here . Activate taser web ! You 're messing with things you don 't understand . Oh , my God ! What do I do ? KAREN , give me an x-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points . Web grenade . Web grenade ! Stutter web . - Great job , Peter . You 're 98 % successful . - 98 ? Yeah , Spider-Man ! No , no ! No ! What the hell ? What the hell ? Hi , Spider-Man ! " Band practice " , was it ? Yeah , Iron Man ! Uhh , Mr. Stark ? Hey , Mr. Stark , can I do anything ? What do you want me to do ? I think you 've done enough . So that 's it ? You 're just gonna run ? Feds were waiting for us . And now , we 're on Iron Man 's radar ? Yeah , I 'm running . - You should , too . - You know I can 't do that . - So now , what ? - Mason . Can you get that high altitude seal up and running in time ? Seriously ? Yes . You will not regret this . You in ? Previously on " Peter screws the Pooch , " I thought you 'd stayed away from this , instead , you hacked a multi-million dollar suit so you could sneak around , behind my back , doing the one thing I told you not to do . - Is everyone okay ? - No thanks to you . No thanks to me ? Those weapons were out there and I tried to tell you about it , but you didn 't listen . None of this would 've happened if you had just listened to me . If you even cared , you 'd actually be here . I did listen , kid . Who do you think called the FBI , huh ? Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you ? Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year old kid . - I 'm 15 . - No , this is where you zip it ! All right ? The adult is talking . What if somebody had died tonight ? Different story , right ? ' Cause that 's on you . And if you died ... I feel like that 's on me . - I don 't need that on my conscience . - Yes , sir ... I 'm sorry , I ... - Sorry doesn 't cut it . - I understand . I just wanted to be like you . And I wanted you to be better . Okay . It 's not working out . I 'm gonna need the suit back . - For how long ? - Forever . No . No , no , no . Please ... - Let 's have it . - You don 't understand ... This is all I have . I 'm nothing without this suit . If you 're nothing without this suit , then you shouldn 't have it . Okay ? God , I sound like my dad . I don 't have any other clothes . Okay . We 'll sort that out . I 've been calling you all day . But you don 't answer your phone . You can 't do that . Then this ferry thing happens ... I 've called five police stations . Five . I called 5 of your friends . I called Ned 's mother . I 'm fine . May , I 'm okay . Honestly , just relax . I 'm fine . Cut the bullshit . I know you left detention . I know you left the hotel room in Washington . I know you sneak out of this house every night . There 's no fine . Peter , you have to tell me what 's going on . Just lay it out . It 's just me and you . I lost the Stark internship . - What ? - Yeah . What happened ? I just said that I could work really hard , and he could , he would , you know ... But ... I screwed it up . That 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm sorry I made you worry . - You know I 'm not trying to ruin your life . - Yeah , I know . - I used to sneak out , too . - Yeah ? And take a shower . You smell ... Smell like garbage . I know . Peter , you 're a good kid , and you 're a smart kid . So just try to keep your head straight , okay ? - Okay . - Alright . Get out of here . Are you expelled ? Do you have to go to that high school on 46th , - where the principal has a crossbow ? - Pretty sure that 's an urban myth , but no , I 'm not expelled . You 're so lucky . - Hey . - Hey . I thought you had Calculus , fifth period . Yeah , I 'm just dipped on Homecoming stuff . Hey , look . I , uhh ... - I just wanted to apologize about the whole decathlon thing . - It 's fine . Last week , decathlon was the most important thing , but ... I almost died . No . I ju-- - I just mean that ... It was not cool , especially be ... Because I like you . I know . - You do ? - You 're terrible at keeping secrets . Yeah , you 'd be surprised . I , I gotta get to class , but , umm ... I 'd say we should hang out , but I 'm gonna be in detention for a bit ... Ever ... But , umm ... I guess you already have a date for Homecoming . Actually , I 'm so busy planning it , I never really got around to that part , so ... - You wanna , go with me ? - Yeah . - Sure . - Really ? I mean , uhh ... Great . Cool . - Cool . - I 'm actually , going that way . May , I need your help ! Right ? It 's game day . So ... What 's the plan ? Open the door for her . Tell her she looks nice . But not too much because that 's creepy . No . And , uhh ... When I dance with her , I 'll put my hands on her hips . Your daffodils . - Love you . - Bye . - You must be Peter . - Yeah . I 'm Liz ' Dad . Put her there . Hell of a grip ! Come on in here . Come on . Hi , Peter . - You look very handsome . - Thank you . You got his name , right ? - Freddy ? - Peter . Peter .

Wow , wow , wow , do you look beautiful . - Please don 't embarass me , Dad . - Doesn 't she , Pete ? Yeah , you look really good . Once again , that 's the right answer . - Is that a corsage ? - Thanks . Well , hey , I 'm your chauffeur , so let 's get this show on the road . No , no , no . We have to take some pictures , Babe . Right here . Perfect . Okay ... Come on , you guys . Peter , closer . Smile ! There you go . - Sir , you don 't have to drive us .. - Nah . It 's not a big deal . I 'm going out of town . It 's right on my way . - He 's always coming and going . - Last time , Babe . - Thank you . - I promise . - See you in a couple of days . - Okay . Come on , Pedro . - Bye , Peter . Have fun . - Yeah , I will . - What are you gonna do , Pete ? - What ? When you graduate . What do you think you 're gonna do ? - Oh . Umm , I don 't know - Don 't grill him , Dad . Just sayin ' . You know . While you guys are going to that school , you pretty much have your life planned out , right ? Yeah ... No , I 'm just a sophomore . Peter has an internship with Tony Stark , so , - I think he doesn 't have to worry . - Really ? - Stark ? - So cool . What do you do ? Yeah , actually , I don 't intern for him anymore . - Seriously ? - Yeah . It got , umm ... - Boring . - It was boring ? - You got to hang out with Spider-Man . - Really ? Spider-Man ? Wow . What 's he like ? Yeah , he 's nice . Nice man . Solid dude . - Look ! So cute . - Aww . I 've seen you around , right ? I mean ... Somewhere . We 've , uhh ... Have we ever ? Because even the voice ... He does academic decathlon , I think . - And he was at my party . - It was a great party ! Really great , yeah . Beautiful house . Lot of windows . - You were there for like , 2 seconds . - That was ... I was there longer than 2 seconds . - You disappeared . - No . No , I did not disappear . Yes , you did , you disappeared like you always do . Like you did in DC , too . That was terrible , what happened down there in DC , though . Were you scared ? I bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man showed up in the elevator though , huh ? Yeah , well , I ... I actually didn 't go up . I saw it all from the ground . Pretty lucky that he was there that day . Good ol ' Spider-Man . Dad . The light . Here we are . - End of the line . - Thanks , Dad . You head in there , Gumdrop . I 'm gonna give Peter the , " Dad talk " . Don 't let him intimidate you . - Love you . - Love you , Gumdrop . Have a safe flight . You guys look so pretty ! - Does she know ? - Know what ? So she doesn 't . Good . Close to the vest . I admire that . I got a few secrets of my own . Of all the reasons I didn 't want my daughter to date ... Peter , nothing is more important than family . You saved my daughter 's life and I could never forget something like that . So I 'm gonna give you one chance . Are you ready ? You walk through those doors , you forget any of this happened . And don 't you ever , ever ... Interfere with my business again . Because if you do ... I 'll kill you ... And everybody you love . I 'll kill you dead . That 's what I I 'll do to protect my family , Pete . You understand ? Hey . I just saved your life . - Now , what do you say ? - Thank you . You 're welcome . Now , you go in there , and you show my daughter a good time . Okay ? Just not too good . What did he say to you ? I gotta go . I 'm sorry . You don 't deserve this . He gave you a choice . You chose wrong . - What the hell ? - What 's with the crappy costume ? My web shooters . I wasn 't sure about this thing at first , but ... Damn ! Gross ! - Why did he send you here ? - Guess you 'll never know . Nice shot ! Ned , the guy with the wings is Liz ' Dad . - What ? - I know . I gotta tell Mr. Stark . Call Happy Hogan . He 's Mr. Stark 's head of security . And get a computer and track my phone for me . - Are you gonna be okay ? - Hurry , we gotta catch him before he leaves town ! I 'm sorry about dinner , but ... I know when Branzino 's fresh . And that was not fresh , okay ? So ... Flash , I need your car and your phone . Sir , technically this is my dad 's car , sir . So I can 't-- - - Hello , Ned ? Hey , hey , hey . Can you hear me ? - Go for Ned . Ned . I need you to track my phone for me . Yeah , but where is it ? Genius move . Okay , he just passed a Gamestop on Jackson Avenue . Hey , where are the headlights on this thing ? I 'm in Flash 's car . - I 'll pull the specs . - Okay , you 're on speaker phone . You stole Flash 's car ? Awesome . Yeah , it 's awesome ! Get outta the way , outta the way ! Move ! - Peter , you okay ? - I 've never really driven before . Only in parking lots . This is a huge step up ! - Hey , have you gotten through to Happy yet ? - Yeah , I 'm working on it . I just gotta battle through the phone system . Guy in the chair ! Takeoff in 9 minutes ! Hello ? - Hello ? Who is this ? - Mr. Happy , it 's Ned . - Who ? - I 'm an associate of Peter Parker . - He has something very important to tell you ... - You gotta be shitting me . - Damn ! - Hey , Ned . How are we going on with those headlights ? Round knob , to the left of the steering wheel - turn it clockwise . - Left ? Okay . Okay , perfect . So where 's my phone now ? - He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn . - What ? That makes no sense . - I thought he said he was going out of town . - Weird . Oh , I reached Mr. Happy . Don 't think he likes you , by the way . It sounded like he was catching a flight . - He said something about taking off in 9 minutes . - What ? - He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes . - Boxes ? It 's moving day ! He 's gonna rob that plane ! I gotta stop him . All right . Wheels up in 8 minutes . We just gotta load Tony 's old Hulkbuster armor , prototype for Cap 's new shield , and the Megging ... the Meg ... Thor 's magic belt . Okay , slow down . You 're getting close . It 's on your right . - What ? - Turn right . Turn right ! - Peter ! Are you okay ? - Yeah . Just keep trying to get through to Happy . It 's been an honor , Spider-Man . What are you doing here ? There 's a dance . I 'm ... looking ... at porn . - Surprised ? - Oh , hey , Pete . - I didn 't hear you come in . - It 's over . I 've got you . Y 'know , I gotta tell you , Pete ... I really , really admire your grit . I see why Liz likes you . I do . When you first came into the house , I wasn 't sure . I thought , " really ? " But I get it now . - How could you do this to her ? - To her ? I 'm not doing anything to her , Pete . I 'm doing this , for her . Hmm . Yeah . Peter . You 're young . You don 't understand how the world works . Yeah , but I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong . How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower ? Or any of his little toys ? Those people , Pete , those people up there , the rich and powerful ... They do whatever they want . Guys like us ... Like you and me ... They don 't care about us . We build their roads , and we fight all their wars and everything , but they don 't care about us . We have to pick up after them . We have to eat their table scraps . That 's how it is . I know you know what I 'm talking about , Peter . Why are you telling me this ? Because I want you to understand . And ... I needed a little time to get her airborne . I 'm sorry , Peter . What are you talking about ? That thing hasn 't even touched me yet . True . But then again ... It wasn 't really trying to . - Chief , they 're powering those engines . C 'mon . - Okay . Yeah . Yeah . Okay , ready ? Hello ? ! Hello ? ! Please ... Hey , please ... I 'm down here ! I 'm down here ! I 'm stuck . I 'm stuck ! I can 't move ... I can 't ... If you 're nothing without this suit , then you shouldn 't have it . Come on , Peter . Come on , Spider-Man . Come on , Spider-Man . Come on , Spider-Man . Come on , Spider-Man ! Launch for intercept . Green light . Green light . Oh , yeah . Retro-reflective panels engaged . Got a visual on the plane , but feeling little resistance . It 's probably just drag on the new turbines . Look out for the cloaking camera . Stay on the blindspots . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Deploy high altitude vacuum seal . This better work , Mason . Trust me , boss . Even one of those boxes , and we are set for life . Yeah . You have 30 seconds to get to the cockpit and override their security . - Cloning transponder signal . - Launching decoy drone . Entering new coordinates . - Good . So it 's on its way ? - Yes , sir . Right on course . Okay . Thank you . All right . Hot dog . Just a typical Homecoming ... on the outside of an invisible jet ... fighting my girlfriend 's dad . Oh , God ! I can 't believe that worked ! Chief , Chief , you 're losing altitude . Get outta there ! I 'm not going home empty-handed . Oh , my God ! Get out of there ! What are you doing ? ! Please turn , please turn ! Hey , Pedro . Bingo . Your wings ... Your wings are gonna explode ! - Time to go home , Pete ! - I 'm trying to save you ! No . You looked so insane . The whole ... Like , it was just crazy ! He was just like ... And you were like ... And then I just hit him with the ... It was so ... Oh , my God . And you saved me . Awesome . Hey , Liz ! I 'm gonna miss you . Liz . Liz , look , I 'm so sorry . You say that a lot . What are you sorry for this time ? The dance ? That , was a pretty crappy thing to do . Yeah , but ... Your Dad . I can 't imagine what you 're going through . If there 's anything I can do to help ... I guess we 're moving to Oregon . Mom says it 's nice there , so that 's cool . Anyways , Dad doesn 't want us here during the trial , so ... Liz , I ... I ... Bye , Peter . Whatever 's going on with you , I hope you figure it out . Congratulations , decathlon national champions ! I 'm gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon , but , just for motivation right now , at this practice . I 'm a little ahead of the game , but we will need a new team captain next year . So I am appointing Michelle . Thank you . My friends call me " MJ . " I thought you didn 't have any friends . I didn 't . - I gotta go . - Hey , where 're you going ? What are you hiding , Peter ? I 'm just kidding . I don 't care . Bye . Alright . So , we should run some drills . Hey , Happy . What are you doing here ? I really owe you one . I don 't know what I would do without this job . I mean , before I met Tony ... So , how long have you been here ? Long enough to be awkward . Boss wants to see you . Is he here , too ? In the toilet ? No . He 's upstate . Upstate ? Like upstate , upstate ? Yeah . Let 's go . Take a look . It 's pretty impressive , huh ? They just finished remodelling the whole thing . - You don 't see that everyday . - Oh , there they are . - How was the ride out ? - Good . Give me a minute with the kid . - Seriously ? - Yeah . - I gotta talk to the kid . - I 'll be close behind . How about a loose follow , alright ? Boundaries are good . Sorry I took your suit . I mean , you had it coming . Actually , it turns out , it was the perfect , sort of tough love moment that you needed , right ? To urge you on , right ? Wouldn 't you think ? Don 't you think ? Let 's just say it was . - Mr. Stark , I really ... - You screwed the pooch hard , big-time . But then , you did the right thing . You took the dog to the free clinic , you ... Raised the hybrid puppies ... All right , not my best analogy . I was wrong about you . I think with a little more mentoring ... You could be a real asset to the team . - To the team ? - Yeah . Anyway ... There 's about 50 reporters behind that door . Real ones , not bloggers . When you 're ready ... I want you to try that on . And I 'll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers : Spider-Man . Yeah . Give that a lick . So , after the press conference , Happy will show you to your room , your new quarters . - Where 's he between ? He 's next to Vision ? - Yeah , Vision 's not big on doors . - Or walls . - He 'll fit right in . Thank you , Mr. Stark . But , I ... I 'm good . You 're good ? Good , how are you good ? I mean , I 'd rather just stay on the ground , for a little while . Friendly , neighborhood Spider-Man . Somebody 's gotta stick out for the little guy , right ? Are you turning me down ? You better think about this . Look at that . Look at me . Last chance : Yes or No ? - No . - Okay . It 's kind of a Springsteeny , working class hero , vibe of the day . Happy will take you home . - Yeah ? - Yeah . You mind waiting in the car ? I need a minute . - Thank you , Mr. Stark . - Yes , Mr. Parker . You 're very welcome . See you around . That was a test , right ? There 's nobody back there ? Yes . You passed . All right , skedaddle there , young buck . - Thank you , Mr. Stark . Thank you ! - Yeah . Thank you ! Told you he 's a good kid . - Where 's the kid ? - He left . - Everybody 's waiting . - You know what , he actually made a really mature choice . - He just surprised the heck out of us . - Did you guys screw this up ? - He told the kid to go wait in the car . - Are you kidding me ? I have a room full of people in there , waiting for some big announcement . - What am I gonna tell them ? - Think of something . How about ... - Happy , do you still got that ring ? - Do I ... - The engagement ring . - Are you kidding ? I 've been carrying this since 2008 . - Okay . - I think I can think of something better than that . Buy us a little time . Like we need time . - I can 't believe you have that thing in your pocket . - Can I get the door for you , Hon ? Alright . Hey , May , did you get dinner already ? May ? What the fu-- -

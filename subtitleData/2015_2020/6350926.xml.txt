 You shot me . Well , you were gonna shoot me . All right , stay with me , Alan , okay ? Stay with me , Alan , all right ? You have a son now . Think about that . You 're gonna pull through this . Think about that . - No sign of that lunatic Peter . - Thinking he 's crazy is your first mistake . What do you call firing at the Navy ? Aggressive . They 'll think twice about evac . Gotta keep trying . There 's no telling how far the Mycosis has spread . Mayday , Mayday . This is Dr. Kyle Sommer with the CDC . We have the cure for Mycosis . I repeat , we have the cure . We need to be smart , find another way off this island . The longer we wait , the higher the rate of infection . If one of those ships gets to the mainland ... We need as much of the cure as you can carry . - Can you handle that ? - Absolutely . Where are you going ? To make a deal with the devil . What have you done ? ! Save Amy . For what ? ! To look like this ? Look at the two of us . What a pair we make . We 're absolutely hideous . Beautiful . I 'm not beautiful anymore . You know what I am , Landry ? Free . Free to do whatever I want to whoever I want . And right now , I 'd like to thank my immortal sisters for my new face . Ripped By mstoll Two parts cannabis indica , one part capsaicin . When it came to pain management , my mother was a genius . Someone has desecrated the counsel hall . - One of the others saw Jerome ... - Thank you , Carson . I thought it was a fool 's errand , but an outsider found what 's been beneath our feet for centuries . - The Mother Tree ? - What remains of her anyway . Eli , her roots may still be viable . How does that help us ? Dr. Walker said Ilaria wants Mother . Why shouldn 't you be the one to deliver it ? Yes . We can bypass the Navy and the CDC . I 'm sure they 'll pay handsomely . It 's not just about money . Ilaria has power and influence . Anne , you and I are going to be heard around the world . Those 200 followers ? Imagine 2 million . I would follow you anywhere . I need to get underneath the tree and access the roots . There are a number of blocked-off stairways behind the counsel hall . - We were told they were dead ends . - Another one of Michael 's lies . For us , I 'll always find a way . Hey , buddy , why don 't you rest for a bit ? If I gave this much blood , - you 'd have to scrape me off the floor . - I 'm fine . When we get back , the first thing I 'm gonna do is order a pizza from Fellini 's . Thin crust , sausage and mushroom . Two pizzas . One for each of us . Then glorious sleep for a week straight . - That 's a long time . - We 'll take breaks , of course . - Gotta make time for PlayStation . - What 's that ? You mean you 've never played " Call of Duty 4 " ? Oh , man , you are in for a treat . Hey . I know we were real close to getting out of here . I 'm disappointed too . But nothing will stop us from going home . Us maybe , but not my mom . I know , Soren . I wish things were different . It 's not fair . Peter killed my mom . Someone should kill him too . Whoa , hold on now . It may not be perfect or fair , but there 's a system in place to punish people like Peter . And I promise you , I 'll do whatever I have to . Peter is never gonna hurt you or anybody else again . Now what ? Let me find a flashlight . Soren , come back here . Soren . - How long have I been here ? - Five days . It 's strange how the tables have turned . How 's that ? I was here 30 years ago , but I wasn 't the one in this bed . - It was Alan . - What happened ? I shot him . That doesn 't make any sense . Love rarely does . I haven 't completely been honest . Thirty years ago , I was here too . You killed my mom ! Soren , you really shouldn 't have done that . What do you mean , you were here 30 years ago ? Who are you ? At least tell me why you stole my father 's sword . You know what it means , don 't you ? I can read it . It 's string of letters , dozens of them . " C-A-C G-U-C A-C-A ... " That 's an RNA code . Each letter stands for a nucleotide . - It 's a recipe for a virus . - Like TXM-7 . But he said it was his legacy . Why would my father create a virus to kill immortals ? All he ever wanted to do was spread immortality . Maybe someone changed his mind . Goddamn it , Caleb , I 'm dying . I don 't have time for games . Just tell me . I want to tell you everything . But first you have to answer one question . Do you know the way to San Jose ? What ... ? Carson ? Hello , Mother . What ? Is something the matter ? Amy , your face . - You 're hurt . - Since when do you care how I feel ? Of course I care . You 're my daughter . Oh , really ? You didn 't seem to care that much when I begged you not to let my father have me . I couldn 't admit I was wrong about Michael , because that would mean my entire life was a lie . I told myself laying with him was a privilege . But it was no honor . It was abuse , so deeply rooted that I accepted it like the air we breathe . I am so sorry , Amy . No , no , no . You don 't get to do this . Not now . It 's too late . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . There 's still hope for us . Oh , no , Mother . There 's no hope . And no amount of distance will allow us to escape what we are . You may not look like us , but inside you 're a monster , a freak , just like me . Please give me another chance . You don 't deserve another chance . And I won 't allow you one . The baby . No . Give me the baby . No . - I won 't let you make him like me . - No ! If you follow us , I 'll make sure it never cries again . Goodbye , Mother . Conjunctive symbiosis . The union of two species in a single body . That 's Mother . The root is the host , but the fungus causes the infertility . Luckily she 's also disjunctive . She doesn 't need the root for survival . She can survive in any genetic environment . You should really stop talking . I barely had enough thread to suture the wound . Jules ... I said no talking . You can 't give Mother to Ilaria . - We can control it . - Like Michael ? The Mycosis spread through bees . Even Ilaria can 't control nature . Can 't you see that I don 't have a choice ? You do . You do . You have a choice . You know what I have ? I have less than 12 hours to stop the release of Narvik . What happened now ? She shot me . And he 's still talking . I don 't want to get in the middle of this . Can I have a minute ? You need to get back to Paris as soon as you can . - I wanna know if that job offer still stands . - Yeah . Yeah , of course it does . I need to get my son off this island along with the rest of my team . Okay , done . Look , joining us at Ilaria is in the best interest for you and the baby , okay ? Where did Alan go ? I don 't know , but he has Mother . This will do nicely . Give it to me . He 's my friend . Friend ? You ... ? You think it likes you ? Let me show you how much . Cry really loud so all the sisters can hear you . Good baby . You have no friends . Julia . Alan was here . We 're running out of time . - If we don 't find him soon ... - We will . Well , what if we don 't ? He has Mother . He has my sat-phone . - I should 've just let him bleed out . - Maybe you should 've . It sounds callous , but he put himself in this position . - Let 's just focus on finding him . - And then what ? Are you prepared to kill him ? Because he won 't stop . His hatred for immortals , he 's obsessed . - Can 't help you and I being what we are . - It 's not our fault . For the past year , I 've been jumping into every hot zone I can find . - You 've probably done a lot of good . - Wish it was that , but the truth is , if I stop to think about what all this means , I 'd lose my mind . - Did you hear that ? - Yup . Oh , my God . Who would leave a baby like this ? I don 't know . Let 's just take it and go . Sarah , they want the baby . No , no , no . Be careful with that . No , don 't , don 't . Don 't shoot . - Don 't shoot . - Alan could be bleeding to death . - We don 't have time for this . - Trust me . Please , please . Please , he 's my son . Amy ripped my baby out of me . And I 'm guessing that she was responsible for what happened to you . But please don 't hurt him because of what she did . Thank you . Soren ? Where have you been ? I 've been looking all over for you . - Are you all right ? - I 'm fine . What were you thinking ? You had me worried sick . I 'm sorry . I was just following my path . Well , from now on , I need to know where your path goes at all times . Look , this is kind of new for both of us , so we gotta figure it out together . It 's just , no one ever cared where I went before . - All right , let 's get back to work . - Okay . Drop the can . You even know how to operate that thing ? I don 't need to . Is that all you got ? Two weeks ago , I would 've had a completely different answer to that question . You know , I should be thanking you . When you left me down there in that hole , I thought it was the end . But it was just the beginning . See , that 's the thing about hitting rock bottom . It gives you a lot of time to reassess what 's really important . Not so fast . You know , I used to think that I ... I didn 't deserve to be happy . That I 'd never really find love , get married , have children . But I 've learned that family is not what you 're born with , it 's what you choose . Family stands by you no matter what . Unconditionally . That is why ... I know , Alan ... that you ... Are not my family . - You really mean it ? - Sure do . Whoever makes the cure gets to name it . But didn 't Alan make it ? I 'm sure he wouldn 't mind if we named it after you . How about Sorenol ? How about Olivia ? I think that 's a great idea . Smell that ? Yeah . It smells like smoke . MAN St. Germain , this is the USS Independence . We have a visual . Fire on ground , do you copy ? Heck , yeah , we copy . Standing by with the cure . Be advised , we 're sending in another chopper . Evac at 0400 . Over . We gotta go find Dr. Jordan . And I 'm not letting you out of my sight . Come on . - We need to get out of here . - Not until I get my bag back and Mother . How are you gonna do that ? You have no idea where Alan is . I do now . Who do you think started that fire ? He 's trying to destroy Mother . Come on . - No , Julia . I can 't . - What ? I have to get my child to safety . Okay . I 'll meet you outside . Dr. Walker ? Dr. Jordan ? I can 't wait to see what the ladies have done to you . What are you doing ? Let go ! Let go ! Let go of me ! Let go . Let go ! Let go ! Landry ! Landry ! Help me . Please . Landry . Please . Help me . Help , help , help . Come on . Landry ! Landry ! No ! No ! No ! Let go ! No ! No . No ! Alan ? Alan ? Alan ? Alan ? Alan ? Jules . Alan . Alan . Where 's my bag ? Where 's Mother ? Peter ... Okay , come on . Come on . Come on . Let 's go . I 'm going back for our baby . No , Eli . It 's too late . I 'm his father . I have to try . Please , don 't do this . I can 't lose both of you . I told you , I 'll find a way . Sarah ? Sarah ? You ought to keep that kid on a tighter leash . That little shit stabbed me . Someone needs to teach him some manners . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Is that true ? Did you stab him ? Well , don 't ever do that again . Don 't ever do that either . About time someone did that . Let 's go . Landry , stop . Where are you going ? Home . Come on , Julia , where are you ? Before I show you something , do you know the way to San Jose ? Oh . Yes , I do . We were running late on our way up north to where Alan 's family was . We blew a tire on the 101 . The car swerved across four lanes of traffic . We got a tow to a repair shop in San Jose . City hall was just down the street . And in the time it took to patch a tire , we got married . And I 'll never forget what he said . You love is gonna kill me . I do know the way to San Jose . Who are you ? Soren ? I haven 't heard that name for a long time . Dr. Sommer , you have something for us ? Seventeen vials of Mycosis cure . We won 't have time to run this through normal testing protocols . - You don 't have to . This is the real deal . - Can you stake your life on it ? I already have . If he 's telling the truth , we are gonna save thousands of lives with this cure . It 's called Olivia . Okay . We 'll take good care of Olivia . Peter , you opportunistic prick . I know you have Mother . Where is she ? Why , right here , Julia . Claire . What are you doing here ? When we got word of a rescue from St. Germain , we came quickly . But I didn 't call you . That doesn 't mean we weren 't listening . Dr. Farragut has shared how instrumental you were in securing the Mother fungus . How very thoughtful of him . We 'll have to make sure he 's properly compensated . No need . Madame Wallenberg has been more than generous . What about Narvik-C ? Narvik-C ? Please tell me you haven 't discovered a new strain . But you and the board told me about it . I don 't seem to recall that . Nor do I think will anyone at Ilaria . Wow , Dr. Kyle . Have you ever seen so many lights ? Dr. Sommer . - You 've brought in Dr. Farragut ? - Yes , ma 'am . - I have your man . - Do we have enough to make an arrest ? First Bank of Atlanta . Safety deposit box number 274 . It was Alan , wasn 't it ? Why else would my wedding story be the answer to your question ? It was Alan and your father . They created - TXM-7 . - They were always at odds . They found common ground after Ilaria used the fungus to gain control of human procreation . They engineered a virus to kill immortals . But they also came up with a cure . You ? You 're the cure ? Alan said my blood was special . That 's why he hid me on this island . And I 'm gonna stay here until ... Until TXM-7 wipes out the entire immortal population . Take it . - Maybe I don 't deserve it . - You came here looking for a cure . I came here looking for time . That 's the thing . The more you have , the more you want . I can save your life . If the plague is immortality then there 's only one cure . I wish you 'd change your mind . And I wish I could see Alan one more time . Jules ? Sarah ? Where does my food come from ?

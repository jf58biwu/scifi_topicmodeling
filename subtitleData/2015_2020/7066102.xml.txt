 MUSIC : Take Me Home by A B Original He was going to ... .. hurt the baby . He wanted to ... He wanted to take it out of me . I think we better call the police . No , no . Wait , wait , wait . Erm ... You 're not going to tell them , are you ? Perhaps we could come up with a story , or ... Oh , God , I 'm sorry . Why did he want to remove your child ? I don 't know . I think maybe he didn 't trust me . Why not ? Why did you let him drag you into all this mess ? Hmm ? Let you be the face of the Initiative ? After all that work you did in the Zone , Rory . What good did that do ? The Initiative 's the only way I could see to save the Hairies . Well , he isn 't going ... He wasn 't going to save anyone . Is your child Hairy ? Makes sense . All the experimenting he 's been doing . He didn 't tell you , did he ? You 're not going to tell anyone , are you ? Don 't worry . I won 't tell a soul . You can trust me . All that time we worked together in the Zone . Yes . SHE SIGHS But you should go . SHE GASPS PAINED , DEEP BREATHING So what now ? Still got to sort out my brother . See if he 's come to his senses . I might leave you to that . Probably best if you go to the others . I 'll go get the van first . The clinic will be crawling with security . Just stay out of trouble . Bit late for that . Charlie . Charlie ! You want to find your mother ? My mother ? I 'll go tell my father . Can 't tell no-one ! They 'll stop us . I 'll find your mother . And everyone else they locked up . You with me ? Waruu ! Waruu ! You 're alive ! He 's not here . Where 's your mum ? I 'll show you . And you reckon this CA fellow Dolan will help me ? I don 't know . Where 's Latani ? They separated us . Come on . You 're coming with me . It goes off if I step outside the house . He 's holding you here ? Well , then we smash it off . That 'll set off the alarm , too . I 'm not leaving you here with him . Go find Mum . When you 're all together , you can work out what to do . You said you 'd deal with him . Government facilities have been destroyed . News crews are camped outside the building . I take full responsibility . We look weak ! Out of control ! We look like we don 't know what we 're doing ! I 'll find him , neutralize him , or I 'll resign . These are just words . You know , what have you actually done about this ? I 'm working on a number of leads . SHE GROANS You 're a born politician . You know there 's more spin in you than there is in the rest of us put together . I will find him . There 's a girl with him . I haven 't seen her before , in any of our footage . Who is she ? Audrey Martin . No criminal record . And her whereabouts ? No fixed address . I 've put out an urgent call to locate her . We should let the staff at the clinic know to keep an eye out in case she returns . Are we not reopening the clinic ? Replacing the equipment will be simple enough . A couple of days at most . I visited the clinic . And I saw no monsters . Exactly ! That 's what the Initiative does . Makes them like us , so that we feel as you do now . At the clinic , were you under attack ? Were they in full flight ? Razor-sharp fingernails out ? Faster and more powerful than anything you could imagine ? Were they wanting to rip your heart out , Marion ? Of course not . Then you have not seen a Hairy . Mr West ! Mr West , over here ! Can we have a comment , please ? Is the clinic reopened ? Following this cowardly attack on the Inclusion Clinic , the Department of Human Safety today declares that inclusion will now be compulsory for all subhumans . We will not be intimidated by terrorist activities from Hairy sympathisers . We will not change who we are , or how we live . Any subhuman found will be arrested , and escorted by armed guard to the clinic . To further protect our citizens , Bennelong House will now be under 24-hour guard . No residents of Bennelong House will be permitted to leave the premises for any reason whatsoever . I will not be taking any questions . Thank you . What do you mean you 're not taking any questions ? Mr West , can we have a comment ? Mr West ? What caused the attack ? Mr West ? ! But Linda 's there , yeah ? Yeah , she 's fine . Keeping everyone in line . We need blankets , though . That hallway cupboard . Sure . How many are there altogether ? About 20 of us . Shit , is that all ? Yeah . We need to get Alinta out of Waruu 's place . Dolan says he 's hacking the system , deactivating the tag . You trust him ? But if he can get the tag off ... .. then let 's go . Now we get six or ... 313 in progress . Request immediate assistance . Copy that ! Trembley , load up . ELECTRONIC LOCK BEEPS AUTOMATED VOICE : Enter secure ID . Officer Hendricks .

SIREN You 're giving alcohol to kids now ? Just treating you like an adult . You know , I saw footage of the attack on the CA vans . I don 't know how you survived . You left us for dead . They were going to kill us . And you just left . You 're right . Is this where you say you 're going to make it all better ? No , I can 't make it better . Truth is , I screwed up . PHONE BUZZES PHONE BEEPING But I found you . And I got them to release you to me , and now you 're here . So when you 're done being angry with me , you might want to think about what happens next . Your tag hurting you , bub ? No , it 's fine . You sure ? Yeah . It 's not always going to be like this . It 's because I 'm in the government now . You could be a target . You need protection . We 're a family . You , your mum , me . I know that 's not what you want to hear . That 's how it is . I was so scared . Of course you were . I didn 't know where you 'd gone , why you 'd left . I know . But I 'm here now . City is on high alert . It 's not safe . But everything I do is for us . You know that , don 't you ? HE WHISPERS : I love you . I love you , too . That 's my girl .

Allow the powers to come through . How do I get out ? Koen ! There 's been a disturbance at Bennelong House . One officer has been killed . There are intruders in the building , assumed to be subhumans . The number is unknown at this stage . Requesting reinforcements . Approved . KNOCKING Alinta ! Alinta , I 've got to go to the office . Alinta . I want to know why my daughter 's security tag has malfunctioned and where the hell she is . Mr West , the system notified us of a problem with the device when we activated the tracking function . That 's her . Where is that ? 25 Miller Street , Jubilee . Send a CA crew to pick her up . Erm ... What ? It 's the home of a CA officer . Going in ! Check the exits . Nerida , Alinta . What the hell ? Dad ? MAN 1 : Bedroom 's clear . MAN 2 : Clear ! Well , this is cosy , isn 't it ? You 've been harbouring Hairy sympathisers . Did you realise ? Dangerous fugitives . Serious penalties for that , especially for a CA man . Just leave him alone . You should have thought about that before you muscled your way in on my family . Get him out of here . Going to be a hero , Tim ? Come on , let 's go . You know , they 're not the enemy , you are . Keep it going . Move , move . What do you want ? You . Alinta . It 's never going to happen . We made a vow . Take them . Stay down ! SHOUTING AND SCREAMING Put your hands behind your back . MAN : Calm down ! NERIDA : Alinta , don 't fight . It 's OK . MAN : Behind your back ! OK , let 's go . What about this one ? Don 't worry about her . She 'll be dead soon enough . DOOR CLOSES Go , go , go ! Clear visual . Shoot to kill . Target on site . Shoot to kill ! INDISTINCT RADIO AND SIRENS Is this everyone ? That 's here in the building now , yes . You all ready to travel ? Where to ? Bindawu for now , but we 'll be back to fight for the rest of our land . Bindawu ? We won 't be allowed there . I 'm changing things . Come on , let 's go . Quickly ! SCREAMING HE ROARS SCREAMING I want him alive . That might not be possible . We need to question him . Hesitate and you 'll be seen as weak . It 's a risk I 'm willing to take . And make sure the on-site commanding officer knows that . HEAVY BREATHING SQUAWKING You . SHOUTING GASPS What kind of skin are you ? Koen ? Latani , you 're safe . You know him ? DOOR BANGS You 've ignored six calls from me . I 'm here now . Same Hairy who hit the vans with his own prisoners . I 'm well aware of that . Your impromptu unauthorised announcement to the press , what the hell was that ? Tough measures needed to be taken . And then you made yourself completely un-contactable . What is it you 've actually done ? Other than be the frontman for a procedure invented by Slade ? You couldn 't help with the attack on the vans , you found no information on the blue light creature , everything you 've been in charge of has come under attack . First the clinic and now this . You 're a liability . And you 're done if you don 't get me that Hairy rebel alive . Now ! INDISTINCT RADIO Copy that . What 's the situation ? They 're still inside . The ringleader 's taken them all to the ground floor apartment . We have it covered . Tell your men to hold their fire . He 's subhuman and armed . That 's an order . Hold your fire . I repeat , hold your fire . You told them . You skin . No . You come from outside . Place is guarded . How did you do it ? No-one asked you to come . We can make them listen . It 's not your fight . SNIFFLING Move . Wait . You can 't go out there . They 'll kill you . Hairy ! Hold your fire . Out of my way . I 'm a proud Bindawu man . My people ? We 've lived here for thousands of years . And I 'm here to take back what 's ours . Hold your fire ! The creature responsible for the bloody ambush on the Containment Authority transport vehicles is operating a coordinated hostage situation out of Bennelong House . Crossing live now to the scene where the CA have the hostage site surrounded . I want your men to move in . There 's one human amongst them . He must be taken alive . No-one fires unless it 's on my command . Copy that . Stand by . Move it out . Let 's go . Let 's go ! Stand to , stand to . We need to make decisions now or these people will die . We fight . If they do , they 'll be killed . We are here because you didn 't fight for our culture . Where 's your pride ? HE WHISPERS IN OTHER LANGUAGE We kill them all . No , we won 't . You with me ? No . You are Bindawu . This is our land . And we will have it back . Without skins . Killing more people won 't change anything . We fight now . We fight for sovereignty . That won 't get you anything but bloodshed . When has this land ever not had bloodshed on it ? You 'll kill some of them . Sure . But then they 'll kill all of you . And they 'll start here . And when all of you included are gone , and they 've bled the city dry , they 'll move out to the mountains , to the mobs in the deserts and the plains . They 'll wipe you all out and for what ? It 's OK to fight , but if you 're going to fight , be smart . Koen is right . We 're outnumbered . We fight , we will all die . You trust this skin ? You think he can save you ? I have no love for this man . But I will not now offer myself up as a sacrifice to the humans . We need to leave . They can 't fight . Their strength has been taken . Like scared little children . I know a way out of here . I 've used it before . Then we run . No-one 's running . What are you going to do ? Are you going to force them to stay ? Kill your own people if they resist you ? Jarli , come with us . We need you . You can 't get out anyway without fighting . You can if the CA are distracted . You give me two minutes and then you lead everyone out of here , OK ? Let 's go . Will you come with us ? I will not run . Forward position , go ! Hold your fire . Fall back ! Go ! Move in . Go ! The people in this building did nothing wrong . People ? Subhumans . They killed an innocent man here last night . You 've taken everything away from them . What do you want ? The government needs to sit down and negotiate a treaty with the Hairy people . Our people don 't even have a treaty . What makes you think the Hairies will get one ? I 'll surrender myself to the government . You 'll be the man that saved the city . Do you have the authority to make that deal , or do I have to talk to your boss ? I have the authority . Prove that I can trust you . What did you see ? Enough . I surrender . Guards , contain this man . Wait . No , Mum , Mum , wait ! Mum , wait ! I 'll go first . We don 't know if they 've got the exit covered . I know . What are you going to say to your bosses when they can 't find me ? I 'll think of something . HE GROANS What have you done ? You 're not the only one who 's special , little brother . You used to fight for the right reasons , Waruu . The younger hunter , he crafted a stronger , much larger boomerang . Takes the boomerang , spills blood all over it like lava . It travels so fast and with so much power ... .. cuts through the hunter , killing him instantly . You never did listen to Uncle Jimmy 's stories . HE SHOUTS Brrrrr-ah ... HE SCREAMS GRUNTING HE GROANS SCREAMING VOICES WHISPER HE CHUCKLES No !

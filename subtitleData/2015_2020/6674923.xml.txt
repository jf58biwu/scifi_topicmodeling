 [ NARRATOR ] Previously on Dark Matter . [ THREE ] Who are you ? [ ONE ] We all woke up just like you . No idea who we are or how we got here . [ SIX ] We 're nothing but a bunch of low-life mercenaries . One of the dreams she experienced was of one of us , sabotaging the stasis pods . [ SIX ] What 's inside ? [ FIVE ] Secrets . How do you think the rest of the crew will react when they find out that you 're an impostor ? [ JACE ] Who are you ? What the hell are you doing with my face ? This is ridiculous . We 're the most wanted criminals in the galaxy and we can 't even scrape together enough money to buy a decent meal ? [ SIX ] Well , we could if you hadn 't lost those weapons . We were ambushed . It wasn 't our fault . So you keep saying . All right , there 's no point in arguing . There 's nothing we can do about it now . Sure there is . We do what we do best ... rob someone . [ THREE chuckles ] Anyone in particular ? I say Ferrous Corp. We find their closest outpost , and we just nail it , hard . They 're already pissed off at us , right ? How much worse could it be ? What do you think ? I think it 's a terrible- - [ THREE coughs ] Sorry , wrong pipe . You were saying ? Sure , it 's what we do , right ? Yeah . What about the vault ? What vault ? I think that 's what it is . It 's down in the lower levels , at the end of a maintenance shaft . I found it when I was exploring the vents . [ TWO ] This is the door you saw in your dream , isn 't it ? [ FIVE ] Yeah . [ SIX ] Well if I were a pirate and a smuggler , and apparently I am , this is the kind of place I might just pick to hide my loot . [ TWO ] Has anyone else been down here before ? No , definitely not me . Alpha-numeric lock code . Which none of us can remember . You ever dream about the code , kid ? No . But it 's still rattling around in your head isn 't it ? [ FIVE sighs ] [ ONE ] What do you want to do , crack her skull open ? Dig around with a spoon ? Believe me , if I thought that would help- - [ THE ANDROID ] Two , come in please . Go ahead . I think you should all come to the bridge immediately . We 're receiving a transmission . From who ? From someone who says he knows you . [ THE ANDROID ] The signal 's weak this far from the nearest g-comm link . There may be some interference . [ TWO ] Okay . I should warn you : he seems to be a man of little patience ... and tact . Ah . Portia Lin et al . Thanks for keeping me waiting . Your android , a little testy , by the way , you might want to check that out . I thought I was nothing but patient ... ls there something we can do for you ? [ laughs ] Is there something they can- - You hear that ? There was , definitely something you could do for me : your job . The one I set up for you , with Ferrous Corp. ? The one you completely messed up ? This ringing any bells ? ! There were unforeseen circumstances . [ WOMAN ] Babe , have you seen my inhaler ? No , I haven 't seen your inhaler ! I 'm on the phone ! This is interstellar ! You have any idea how much this is costing me ? ! Get outta here ! [ inhales ] [ coughs ] Anyway , where were we ? Oh right , you were talking about how you were gonna make it up to me . Were we ? I didn 't think- - [ MAN ] Let me bottom line this for you , okay ? Ferrous Corp. wants your heads . And without their backing you 've got no political protection , which , given your records , I think we can all agree , is not a good thing . But it 's okay . I 'm gonna take care of it , I 'm gonna smooth things over , and in exchange , you 're gonna do a job for me . What kind of job ? Oh , walk in the park . Salvage job , nothin ' to it . Which is why you 're gonna do it for half of your normal rate . No way . It 's a freighter . ISS Far Horizon . Apparently , it suffered some kind of catastrophic system failure . The resulting explosion exposed most of the upper decks to space . None of the crew survived . Unfortunately , the data stream provided by your friend was a little short on information . I don 't think he 's our friend . [ SIX ] He 's a handler . He gets the jobs , we do the jobs . Like an agent . [ THREE ] I don 't know , guy seems like a scumbag to me . What ? I 'm not allowed to have standards ? The thing I don 't get is , why us ? Why not hire some licensed salvage operation to do the job ? [ TWO ] If I had to guess , there 's something illegal on that ship . Stolen goods , drugs , who knows ? Something valuable ? Can we trust him ? Well , we have worked with him before- - We need him . Without our memories , we have no other connections . We 're completely on our own . Am I wrong ? [ TWO ] We 're nine hours out from the freighter 's last known location , so everyone get some sleep . [ ONE ] Oh , h-hi . Um , I just came by to see if you wanted to , urn ... [ THREE groans ] Hey . If you wanted to go ... over the plans for the ... salvage . Oh , sure . Why don 't we go up to the bridge and we 'll go over it . Are you coming ? Yeah . [ THE ANDROID ] As far as we know , the ship 's FTL drive is intact , but navigation from the bridge is impossible . If we can establish a remote link in the engineering section , I might be able to upload a jump sequence from here . The ship will then fly itself to its original destination . You do know the guns are just a precaution , right ? The ship 's abandoned . Might be rats . [ THREE ] I hate rats . Android , come in . [ THE ANDROID ] I 'm reading you . Go ahead . [ TWO ] We 're in . Life support 's operational , but minimal . It 's a little cold in here . [ THE ANDROID ] The ship is operating on emergency power only , but I estimate at least six hours before life support shuts down completely . That should be more than enough time . Understood . We 'll head to engineering now . [ THREE ] I think we should look around a little first . We came here to do a job . [ THREE ] You said it yourself , there might be some nice , tasty contraband kicking around here somewhere . Which they want back . That 's why they hired us . Half the ship 's exposed to space . Who 's gonna be surprised if there 's a little contraband that goes missing ? Am I right , hmm ? Yeah . Absolutely . [ SIX ] You know , after fuel costs , we 're ... barely making a profit here . Maybe we should at least take a look . All right , fine . I 'll head down to engineering , and hook up the link . I should be 45 minutes . Hour max . When I 'm done , we 're leaving . [ THREE ] Yes , boss . [ THREE chuckles ] How 's it going ? They 've gained access to the ship . So far , so good . Okay . Well , in the meantime , do you think I can drag you away for a sec ? [ THE ANDROID ] I highly doubt that . Despite your low center of gravity , you possess neither the strength nor the stamina to pull my body weight over any significant distance . No , I mean could you help me with something ? Of course . I , on the other hand , possess the strength and the stamina to convey you with great ease . No dragging required . Whoa . No , I just need your help with something in the infirmary . No ... heavy lifting . Okay . Where did you find this ? It was in the storage room , where I found the dead boy . Did you find anything else ? No . I thought it was just data storage , but I 've tried everything , I - | can 't read it . I 'm not surprised , because it 's not data storage . Then what is it ? Curious . The molecular structure is similar to that of a subatomic matrix card , but on a much smaller scale . What does that mean ? [ THE ANDROID ] If I had to guess , I would say this is part of some larger system designed to access pockets of extra-dimensional space . Why would somebody wanna do that ? I ask myself that question all the time . Rarely do I get a satisfactory answer . Right . Thanks anyways . Do me a favor , don 't tell any of the others about this , okay ? I thought you had resolved to trust them . Well , some of them , anyway . Yeah , so did I. [ banging ] [ THREE ] Empty . [ clanging ] [ THREE ] The hell is that ? [ creaking ] I think the other side of this wall is exposed to space . Could be pressure or temperature difference causing the metal to warp . Maybe this isn 't such a good idea . Quit being such a wimp . Gah ! Sonuva- - ! [ rat squeaks ] Little bastard ... Huh , what 'd I say ? I hate rats . [ keyboard keys clicking ] [ computer beeps ] [ TWO ] All right guys , I 'm in . I found a junction box with access to the FTL control . How 's it going on your end ? [ SIX ] Standby . [ SIX ] Think we found something . [ SIX ] Is that blood ? Looks fresh . What 're y- - What 're you talkin ' about , Six ? How could that be ? [ TWO ] Answer me ! Whose blood ? [ FOUR ] I think it was most likely theirs . [ SIX ] We 've got four dead bodies here . [ TWO ] This whole section is still intact . How did they die ? I don 't think it was an accident . It was a violent attack . Not with conventional weapons . Whoever did this used their bare hands ... and teeth . I-I 'm sorry , did you say " teeth " ? Correct . Okay , that 's it . Fall back to my position . We 'll finish hooking up this link and get the hell out of here . One and Three , do you copy ? One and Three , are you reading this ? [ ONE ] We 're getting a lot of interference over the radio . Could be residual radiation from the explosion . [ THREE ] So ? So I 'm not a fan of radiation . We should head back . [ THREE ] Nah , not yet . This ship has yet to give up its riches . [ THREE ] Do we have to have this talk again ? Remember that I am not the one who had his face surgically altered so that he could infiltrate our crew . [ ONE ] It doesn 't prove anything . Nah , maybe not . But it sure does make you wonder though , doesn 't it ? How long are you gonna hold this over me ? I don 't think that far ahead . Well , just remember , when you 're blackmailing someone , you need to be really careful not to push them too far . I know . That 's what I thought . [ Crash ] Six , is that you ? - - [ ZOMBIE snarls ] - - [ TWO grunts ] [ TWO grunts ] [ ZOMBIE snarls ] [ TWO screams ] [ gun fires ] [ ZOMBIE growls ] [ SIX ] Goddamn ! What the hell was that ? [ TWO ] I don 't know . He came out of nowhere . [ SIX ] Lemme take a look . That 's a nasty gash . Android , come in . [ THE ANDROID ] Go ahead . [ keyboard clacks ] I 've established the link . Can you access the ship 's logs ? I believe so . [ TWO ] Then do it . We need to find out what the hell 's going on here . [ THE ANDROID ] I don 't understand . Is something wrong ? [ TWO ] Yeah , you could say that . [ ONE ] This is ridiculous . If there is any contraband on this ship , it 's be gonna be hidden , right ? Behind the walls , under the floors , it 's not gonna be in plain sight . [ THREE ] Ahh , trust me . I got a nose for this kind of thing . [ ONE ] Yeah ? How do you know ? Well , you assume because you 're not the real Jace Corso , that you 're not a criminal , right ? How do you know ? [ ONE ] Okay , fine . But while we 're having this frank discussion ... [ THREE ] Mm-hm ? [ ONE ] What the hell happened between you and Two ? I think that 's pretty obvious , isn 't it ? You get her drunk ? No , but I totally would have . No , in fact , she came on to me . Wasn 't subtle , either . Practically an order . You know , she does like to be in charge . Wouldn 't think you were her type . Let me guess , you thought you were ? Got news for you , Pretty Boy . With a woman like that , that whole sensitive nice-guy thing you got going on doesn 't cut it . We 'll see . [ THREE chuckles ] Yeah , we 'll see ... [ SIX ] He was a crewman . At ... least he was before he turned into that . [ FOUR ] Well , it 's possible he 's the one who killed the others . By himself , against four people ? No weapons ? [ TWO ] Hey , you didn 't have to fight him off . I believe it . [ FOUR ] Still , we can 't assume he 's the only one . Whatever happened to him may have happened to the other crew members . One and Three , come in . [ radio static ] Guys , please respond . There may be a potential threat onboard the ship . Do you copy ? [ radio static ] Dammit ... Raza to boarding party , come in , please . Go ahead . [ THE ANDROID ] It appears most of the freighter 's command logs were destroyed in the explosion , however I did manage to salvage a portion of the audio report by the first officer . [ recording ] ... At first , we believed it to be a series of random attacks Violent behavior , signs ... possible contagion Has no idea where ... now certain it is not an airborne pathogen , but more likely ... and blood . Can you enhance that last part any more ? Give me a moment . Standby . [ recording ] ... More likely transmitted by fluids such as saliva and blood . [ SIX ] 'Kay . We 're not gonna panic . We just need more information . Android , I want you to sift through every scrap of data you can salvage from this ship . See if the infirmary survived the explosion and tap into those logs . Scanning now . In the meantime , we 've gotta get Two back to the ship . She needs medical attention . Understood . [ FOUR ] Look , we can 't do that . You heard the recording . It 's a contagion . She 's been bitten . [ SIX ] We don 't know anything for sure . [ TWO ] No , no . He 's right . If I go back there , the same thing that happened here could happen on the Raza . [ SIX ] We don 't know what happened here . All we have are fragments of a partial report . She said it was a possible contagion , that might have been transferred by contact . [ FOUR ] She said it was " likely . " Whatever . Even if you are infected , maybe there 's something we can do about it . Maybe there 's a treatment , if we can catch it soon enough . That is a lot of maybes . What 's the alternative ? We just leave her here ? Life support 's gonna fail in less than six hours . Yeah , well , it 's a merciful end , compared to that one . [ SIX ] We 're not leaving anyone behind ! Well , that 's not up to you . [ THE ANDROID ] May I offer a suggestion ? [ TWO ] Go ahead . The ship 's infirmary is equipped with an isolation chamber . It would be more than adequate for quarantine purposes . Once you 're inside , we can scan for the presence of any known viruses in our medical database . Short of simply waiting for symptoms to appear , it 's the only way to know for sure . What about One and Three ? I 'll come back and get ' em . I 'm not taking no for an answer . Let 's go . All right , we 're en route . I 'll prep the isolation chamber . And we 've been having trouble with radio communications on the freighter . Must be some kind of interference . See if you can figure out what 's causing it . Understood . [ FOUR ] There may not be interference . It 's possible they 're not responding because they were also attacked and are either dead or incapacitated . That 's what I like about you . Always looking on the bright side . [ FOUR ] I 'm realistic . Those two can handle themselves . I 'd be more worried about them attacking each other . [ FOUR ] Good point . Good point . [ ONE ] Why does this corridor look familiar ? [ THREE ] I don 't know what you 're talking about . [ ONE ] We 've been here before . We 're going in circles . Don 't be ridiculous . I have a very keen sense of direction . Don 't ask me how I know that ! [ ONE ] This is great . We 're out of radio contact , and we 're lost . [ THREE ] We 're fine . [ ONE ] You 're an idiot . [ THREE ] You 're an arrogant son of a bitch , you know that ? [ ONE ] Excuse me ? ! [ THREE ] Yeah , you play all humble , but deep down you think you 're better than the rest of us . You think we 're scumbags and somehow you 're different . Well , maybe not all of you . [ THREE ] You 're always going on about the " team " and how we gotta help each other out . Well , I 'm here trying to put food on our table . What 're you doing exactly ? Hm ? All right , look , I admit , I haven 't been exact- - Shut up . What , you 're not even gonna let me talk ? - -I 'm trying to tell you- - - -Shh ! I hear something ... [ groaning ] [ THREE ] You hear that ? [ groaning , rasping ] Hold up . [ groaning ] One , two , three . [ ONE ] Hello ? [ ONE ] Are you okay ? [ groans. growls ] [ ONE ] What the hell ? ! [ ONE ] Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , easy with that thing ! [ THREE pants ] [ THREE ] What 'd you want me to do ? Offer her a drink with that human arm she was munching on ? Huh ? [ ONE ] This ship is already full of holes . Let 's not make anymore if we can help it . Are you all right ? Well , I guess we 're gonna find out . Now what ? Beginning the scan . [ beeping ] [ THE ANDROID ] There are several thousand viruses and bacteriological agents in the database . This may take some time . And what if this isn 't in the database ? [ FOUR ] If she starts to turn , I 'll take care of it . [ ONE ] The crew of this ship is supposed to be dead . They are definitely not supposed to be diseased , cannibal monsters . I would 've remembered that . [ THREE ] I ... never should 've trusted that scumbag . [ ONE groans ] [ ONE ] Great , another dead end . What happened to your amazing sense of direction ? [ THREE ] Who could concentrate with all your whining ? Looks like we 'll have to go back . Back ? Where they came from ? I don 't think so . I 've seen Five do this , how hard can it be ? [ banging ] Ugh . Whoa , whoa . H-How do we know that on the other side of this door is not exposed to space ? Metal 's not cold . There 's gotta be life support on the other side . [ ZOMBIE growls ] [ THREE ] Better hurry up with that . [ ZOMBIE yells ] A little girl could do that ! What 's your problem ? ! Not helping ! [ air hisses ] [ gunfire contines ] Come on ! I got it ! Let 's go ! Oh , crap . [ ONE ] What did I say about bullets ? ! [ ONE , THREE grunt ] Grab my hand ! [ THREE ] I can 't ! I 'm slipping ! [ ONE grunts ] On three ... one , two , three ! [ BOTH grunt ] [ THE ANDROID ] Six , this is the bridge . Go ahead . I 've found the source of the interference . As we suspected , it 's residual radiation from the explosion that destroyed the upper decks . One and Three must be somewhere in the affected area . The levels are non-toxic , but it 's greatly reducing the range of their comms . I 'll take a slow pass over that section , see if I can raise ' em . Android , this is Four , I 'm in the infirmary . You 'd better get down here . [ ONE groans ] [ THREE ] All right , we 'd better get going . No . I 'm not going anywhere . Not until we come up with a plan . We gotta get back to the airlock . The airlock 's on the other side of that breach , genius . We 'll find another one . And how do you wanna let the others know where to come pick us up ? Or do you just wanna open the door and jump over to the Raza ? Fine . What 's your brilliant plan ? I don 't know yet . I need a second . And you 're welcome , by the way . What ? What , for that ? Really ? Fine . Thank you . This makes us even . Let 's not go crazy , huh ? It doesn 't matter . I don 't care anymore . If we make it back , you can tell them whatever you want . You wanna take your chance with the others , be my guest . I mean , Five , she 's a couple short of a deck , and no one really cares what she thinks anyway . Six ? I don 't really know what I think about him . But Four , watch out for that guy . He 'll slit your throat in your sleep . Two would understand . Would she ? You sure about that ? I was afraid of this . [ FIVE ] What is it ? [ THE ANDROID ] Using the navigational input recorded by the freighter 's FTL computer , I was able to extrapolate their last port of call . The Far Horizon went somewhere it was not authorized to go . Where ? A planet called Taurian Alpha . It was the site of a pharmaceutical research facility , but now it 's under galactic quarantine . I 'm guessing something went wrong with the research . The trees on Taurian Alpha live for tens of thousands of years . It was thought that their chemical structure could be used to synthesize a drug that would effectively make human beings immortal . Instead , they created one of the most deadly viruses humankind has ever seen . [ FOUR ] Why would the ship go there ? [ TWO ] Somebody spent billions on that research . [ THE ANDROID ] It was run by a division of Traugott Corporation . [ TWO ] Yeah , they 're not just gonna let that go . Sure , officially they abide by the quarantine . Unofficially , they send someone in to smuggle out whatever they can , then continue their research again somewhere else . Well , they didn 't get very far . How long do I have ? [ THE ANDROID ] Typically , symptoms appear within three hours of exposure . And I assume there 's no cure ? I 'll continue to search the database . Hey . Hey ! - -What the hell 's going on ? - -I think we both passed out . The air 's getting thin in here . It is getting hard to breathe . We lost a lot of pressure during the breach . We 'll have to slow our breathing . Yeah . And talk a little less . One , Three , this is Six , come in . [ radio static ] One , Three , this is Six , come in . Six , we 're reading you . Where are you ? I 'm just outside the ship , in the Marauder . I can 't be far from your position . What 's your situation ? It 's ... kind of a long story . Yeah , does it involve flesh-eating crewmen ? So you know about them . It 's some kind of infection . Looks like Two 's been exposed . Your signal 's getting stronger . I 'll zero in on it , then see if I can find you an exit point . Hold on . [ FOUR ] Are you sure you want to wait until it begins ? I can give you an honorable death before it comes to that . Are you serious ? I 'd rather have a dishonorable life . [ FOUR ] And you did , by all accounts . I don 't feel any different . I don 't feel anything . I think there 's been a mistake . [ FOUR ] The scan confirmed the presence of the virus . There is no mistake . Look , if it was me , I 'd want to go while I still had my wits about me , and in control . Not yet . [ SIX ] All right guys , I should be right outside your position . I can see a small hull breach . [ ONE ] Yeah , that was us . We had a little ... accident . We sealed it off though . [ SIX ] All right , I can see another airlock , looks like it 's intact . It 's two levels down and about 100 meters aft . You think you can find it ? Do we have a choice ? You may have to move deeper in the ship to find a way down . May lose radio contact , but I 'll dock and I 'll wait for you . Understood . We 're on our way . [ THE ANDROID ] Marauder , this is the Raza . Go ahead . Did you find them ? Yeah , they were right where you said they 'd be . Then we have a problem . What ? My readings indicate that life support in that section is failing . Oxygen levels are critical . If you don 't get them out in the next ten minutes , they 'll suffocate . One , Three , come in . [ radio static ] Guys , come in we 've got a problem . The freighter has emergency life support , including O2 tanks located in various parts of the ship , but so far I 've been unable to link up to that system . Well , keep trying . I 'm heading to the airlock now . Understood . I don 't want you to die . I don 't wanna die either . What about One and Three ? I 'm sure they 'll be fine . [ FIVE ] I don 't think any of us are gonna be fine . Even if we get through this . Look , about what happened on the space station , I 'm sorry you had to see that . [ sighs ] I didn 't mean to kill those men . - -It was just- - " Instinct ? I was gonna say reflex . [ TWO ] I wasn 't ready , I wasn 't in control . Next time , it 'll be different . You really think there 's gonna be a next time ? Maybe not for me . [ TWO ] I thought I could make things different , you know ? Take a different path . Now it looks like I might not get the chance . [ TWO ] Do me a favor , don 't give up on the others . [ ONE ] Hold on , I think I got something here . [ ZOMBIE wheezes ] [ THREE ] You sure ? [ ONE ] You see another way down ? [ THREE ] No . [ ONE ] Ugh . Guh ... Slight problem . [ THREE ] What ? [ ZOMBIES wheezing ] [ THREE ] Oh boy . [ ONE ] HOW many ? Seven or eight , they don 't look like they 're doing too good . The lack of air must be affecting them more than us . Well , that 's good . Easier for me to pick off . [ ONE ] No ! No more bullets . Let 's remember what happened last time . So what 's your great idea ? I say we just go down there and walk right past them . For real ? Yeah . If one of them gives you any trouble , just give ' em a swift kick . Look , they 're dying even faster than we are . Let 's take advantage of that while we still can . God , you better be right . This better work . [ THREE ] All right . Shine ' er down . [ THREE sighs ] Marauder , this is the Raza . I did it . I managed to tap into the freighter 's emergency life support . Restoring O2 levels now . Thank god . - - [ ZOMBIES growling ] - - [ air hissing ] What 's that noise ? Fresh air . Get back up here , now ! [ THREE ] Too late ! You can come down now . So much for no bullets . It was only a few . You 're welcome . Let 's get going - [ SIX ] This is the Marauder . I 've got ' em . We 're heading back . [ THE ANDROID ] He 's clean as well . No sign of the virus . Told ya . Didn 't even get a scratch . Now let 's go finish this job . Hold on . How much time ? I should start showing symptoms any minute now . I 'm sorry ... If there was anything I could 've done ... I know . But while you 're still you , there 's one more thing we need to discuss . What ? [ THREE ] This is a big mistake . Do it . You didn 't really think we were gonna let that thing fly itself back to civilization , did you ? Well , I guess there 's no way we 're getting paid now , huh ? Too bad . I 'm just surprised because I thought that we had an arrangement . You have something you 'd like to say ? I think I 'll save it for later . [ ONE ] How long has it been ? Over five hours . Shouldn 't she have started to show symptoms by now ? Normally , yes . I say we scan her again . We already did that . [ ONE ] Look at her . Nothing 's happening . She 's not changing . What do we have to lose ? It 's gone . That can 't be . [ TWO ] I knew it . I knew I wasn 't changing . Let me out of here . I 'm done . [ ONE ] She 's right . Let her out . [ FOUR ] Are you sure that 's wise ? You saw the results . No virus detected . [ SIX ] How 's that possible ? [ THE ANDROID ] According to the Far Horizon 's medical logs , no one has ever had a successful immune response to the virus before . Exactly . [ THE ANDROID ] But that doesn 't change the fact that the virus is no longer present . There is no threat . Look , guys , I can 't explain it any better than you can . But ... what 're we going to do ? Keep her in there forever ? I don 't suppose there 's any chance we can just pretend like this never happened ? Didn 't think so . [ beeping ] Yup . [ beeping ] - -Hey ! - - [ THREE ] Hey . I hope I 'm not disturbing you . No , it 's fine , what 's up ? [ TWO ] Look , I - | wanted to say that I 'm sorry about losing the freighter . But One was right , it was just too dangerous . That 's fine . Just would 've been nice to get a little cash in our pockets for once . Maybe get up to something fun . [ laughs ] Y 'know ... there are other ways to have fun that don 't cost anything . I am , uh , I 'm a little ... tired . You know , it 's been a crazy day . Right . Next time .

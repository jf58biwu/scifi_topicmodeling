 My name is H.G. Wells . My friend John is Jack the Ripper . He 's escaped from 1893 in my time machine , and I 'm the only one who can catch him . I 'm going to kill one person every day ... - Jane ? - Until I get the time machine with the key . Where 's Jane ? Key , or Jane dies . She is his only leverage over you . Why would he kill her ? He will kill her just to get back at me . Let her go , John . Slide it to me . Damn it , Wells . You truly are a ray of light , Miss Walker . You got to start calling me Jane . Right . - Are you following me ? - Man , I don 't know you . Authorities suspect arson . Microwave on high , three minutes . In other news , police continue to search for the Key Killer , who murdered a young woman outside the popular nightclub Utopia last week . It appears two more attacks may be related . Both victims survived . NYPD are currently following all ... Who are you ? John . Who are you ? I live here . Yes , Bella 's roommate . Yes , she said you were away on ... on business . Now I 'm back . Where 's Bella ? She 's in bed . Is that my suit ? Yes . Yeah , it 's a little snug , but otherwise , a nice fit . What the hell ? Bella ? Bella ? Were you up all night with the movers ? Did you get any sleep ? There 's just no time . John has threatened to kill someone every day until he gets what he wants . There are no reports of any new victims . And the time machine is safe here at my house . - All right . - So now , can you fix it ? Yes . I believe so . It 'll take some time , but it was worth it to keep John from escaping . What 's that ? Some type of crystal . That is an alexandrite gemstone . It focuses the light into a specific wavelength that allows the machine to breach the fourth dimension . It is the very heart and soul of the time machine . Well , the important thing is that we find John as soon as possible . I have my team out looking . Morning . Hello . Hi . You look lovely . Thank you . Doug picked up some of my things from my apartment . Ms. Anders , thank you so much for letting me stay here . - Your home is spectacular . - You 're welcome . The most important thing is that we keep you safe until this is over . - I 'll look into what we talked about . - Yes . Thank you . - So , how are you holding up ? - I 'm good . Although , the museum 's pretty freaked that Vanessa moved the whole exhibit . They have no idea what 's going on . I hope I didn 't put your job in jeopardy . No . My boss is scared that Vanessa will sue for negligence , so I told her that Vanessa needed me here working on an inventory for the insurance claim . Remember , H.G. Wells is my responsibility . I am ? Yes , you are . - The exhibit , that is . - Right . Listen , um ... with everything you 've been through , if at any point you want out , you tell me . I 'll understand . Yeah . It 's been pretty intense the past couple days . But I want to see this through . I want to help you . Hello , this is Jane . Hello , Miss Walker . How lovely to hear your voice . Well , I can 't say the same . Well , that hurts ... especially after spending such quality time together . - I remember it rather fondly . - What do you want ? I want the key and the time machine ... now . What do you plan on doing with it ? Hello , H.G. Well , I don 't know . Perhaps I 'll go somewhere that would allow me the opportunity to change ... be a good little boy . You see , I 'm on a personal journey of self-enlightenment , thanks to the eye-opening Miss Walker . Very well . Come and get it . I don 't think so . I shall call you with the exact location , and you will have precisely five minutes to travel to me with the machine and the key . You want me to bring the time machine to you ? Yes . I won 't fall into one of your traps , H.G. You won 't fool me again . Well , I can 't oblige , John , because the time machine is broken . Don 't be ridiculous . - He 's telling the truth , John . - John ? Are we on a first-name basis ? I like that , Jane . You saw me sabotage it yourself . I saw some smoke and loose wires ... nothing the father of time travel can 't remedy . I will give you 12 hours to fix the machine . Please don 't hurt anyone . I granted you life once , Jane , due to my growing affection for you , but it won 't happen again . You know how the saying goes ... one step forward , two steps back . You have 12 hours before I kill again . The clock starts now . But I can 't , J ... John ? John ? H.G. , Jane , this is Martin Scott . He works in the innovation division at my company . Mr. Scott . I asked Vanessa to find someone to assist me in navigating some of the , finer points of 21st-century technology . Mr. Wells , my background is in theoretical physics and quantum mechanics . It is a mind-blowing honor to meet you , sir . I 've read every book you 've written and seen every movie based on your work , my favorite being " The Invisible Man " ... the Claude Rains 1933 version . Movies , as in moving pictures ? In your time , it was a kinetoscope cinematic device . It 's evolved a lot since then . Ms. Anders , your appointment is waiting . I 'll leave you to it , then . Thank you . Mr. Scott , this key ... currently controls where the time machine returns after a journey . I would like you to help me change that . I wish to ensure the time machine returns directly to this ballroom once John Stevenson is inside . Can I see your control board ? Yes , you , you may . - Hi . - Hey , baby . - You look nervous . - No , not at all . Okay , maybe a little bit . You 're so cute . Well , I 'm still not used to giving interviews . I thought you said this was a fluff piece . It is , but this reporter has a reputation for being somewhat of a snake . - Well , if it 's good for the campaign ... - No , I know . But ... I signed up for this . You didn 't . It means a lot to me that you 're doing this . And you mean a lot to me . - Let 's do this . - Okay . She 's waiting for us . I 'm so excited you both agreed to this interview . Well , we love your magazine . I 'll start with a question on everyone 's mind ... after two years of dating , any talk of formalizing things ? Somebody 's looking for a scoop . One of the most powerful businesswomen in the world and a decorated war veteran running for senator . It could be the wedding of the year . We don 't really think of ourselves as a power couple . But you are . Your mutually beneficial partnership has certainly lifted your public profile . Well , that 's not why Griffin and I are together . Well , let 's talk about something else . - Like Vanessa 's philanthropy . - Yes . And you do so with very little publicity . Why maintain such a low profile ? Well , I 've always been a private person . I believe our actions speak for themselves . The equations you used to calculate the subatomic compression rate necessary to breach the fourth dimension were ... super complicated , but I think I 've got them all inputted into the computer . So much information at the very touch of your fingertips . I never could 've imagined such a device . But you did . You called it a " world brain , " a " world Encyclopedia " or ... He hasn 't written the " World Brain " yet . Sorry . Well , perhaps this is the exact moment I got the idea . Shall we test out the machine ? Would you like to do the honor ? Brilliant . That 's brilliant . John will think the key still controls the time machine . Let 's have a go , then , shall we ? What are you doing ? I 'm not going anywhere . This is just a test to see if it 's still functional . What 's wrong now ? Is that normal ? What is that ? - Excuse me for a second . - No , I 'll go . No , you stay here with Chase . - What happened ? - He was testing the ignition . Are you all right ? I 'm fine , I 'm fine . What 's wrong ? This gem is the heart of the temporal-distortion generator . The surplus energy from the power surge has cracked it . You can fix it , though , right ? No . I can 't . It 's destroyed . We 'll never meet John 's deadline now . So sorry . No , it 's okay . It 's not your fault . I have carpal tunnel . Let me take a look at that for you . It 's tender , but everything 's structurally in order . Well , I suppose I just need to stay off the computer , right ? So , are you a doctor or a yoga instructor ? Surgeon , actually . I knew you were too good to be true . Beg your pardon ? Looks , accent , charm , and a surgeon ? I know your type . Brotherhood of the Insufferable Hero Complex . Slice first , ask questions later . That sounded much more charming in my head . Hi . I 'm Brooke . I 'm a neuropathologist . Obviously , I 'm still trying to figure out my own brain damage . Neurology ? I 've always been fascinated . It 's an underrepresented speciality where I 'm from . Well , there 's still so much we have to discover . And so little we can do to fix what goes wrong . But of course , great advancements have been made . No , you were right the first time . But I 'm working on it . Well , I fear humanity must wait a bit longer . I would be honored to buy you a drink . Can 't we just get another one ? The alexandrite was mined in the Ural Mountains in the 1600s . It was rare in 1893 . And it must be this exact size and cut . It might not even exist now . How does this stone allow for time travel ? The facets of the gemstone have been carefully cut to reflect a beam of light that allow the machine to pierce the very fabric of time . You created the laser all the way back in the 1890s . There 's a gemologist I met through the museum . We 've used him to appraise antique jewelry for us . If anyone can find an extinct Russian rock , it 's him . The clock is ticking . Doug , any word on John Stevenson ? He 's using burner phones , then tossing them . Impossible to trace . I 'm following the police investigation . They don 't have much yet . Sam ? Sam ? Sam 's gone for groceries . Where 's my tea ? No , not Sam . It 's me . It 's Chad ... your son . Mom , you know me . Chad , you 've come to see me . Just for a few minutes . Sam can 't find me here . Sam ... h-he 's getting groceries . And he 'll be back soon . But I had to see you . It 's happening . What 's happening ? The time machine . H.G. Wells . H.G. Wells . He 's in New York . He 's here now . He came in his time machine . Are you sure it 's really him ? - Did he bring the Ripper with him ? - Yes . They 're both here . It 's all real , Mom , just as you said . Then you can stop them . There 's still time . Don 't let them go back . You can stop this all from happening . Please , stop . Okay , Mom , I will . Just breathe . I have to go , Mom . It 's important you not tell Sam I was here . I love you , Mom . Excuse me , sir , can I help you ? I was just , wondering what all the noise was earlier . Griffin . I was afraid you left . No , no . The reporter left ... very confused . I 'm still here . I 'm so sorry . You 've been apologizing a lot lately . Instead , how about you tell me what 's going on ? Ever since George arrived , you 've been canceling plans , - making excuses ... - No . You rush off in the middle of an interview . I-it took my staff weeks to set up . - I 'll call to reschedule . - No , that 's not the point . I didn 't ask you to give that interview . You offered . If you don 't want to be a part of my campaign , that 's fine , just tell me . - That 's not it . - Then what is it ? Why can 't you share with me what 's really going on in your life ? I want to explain all of this to you , but right now , I just need you to trust me . Trust that I am making the right decisions for both of us . I 've been trusting you , especially since George got here . So , when are you gonna start trusting me , Vanessa ? - I do trust you , Griffin . - Baby ... what was it you said back there ... " Our actions speak for themselves " ? It 's not that I don 't see the appeal of surgery , I just figured out very early on that I 'd be terrible at it . Nonsense . You have a surplus of talent . The rest is just practice , repetition . No . No way . What you do is a form of performance . With my work , I spend most of my time thinking . I wander in 1,000 different directions , and then , only when I 'm as ready as I 'll ever be , then I test . Yes , but if you don 't like how it goes , you test a different way . Step and repeat . I don 't get that luxury . No , but you 're completely in the moment . You have a human being lying in front of you ... their body open , their heart beating . It 's ... Yes , you have your talent ... and your training , but it 's your instinct , your courage of precision . Surgery is primal . I guess there is an addictive quality to it , knowing that a life is in you hands . There it is , the hero complex I was talking about . Sometimes I fear the drive to do what I do doesn 't always come from a place of heroism . Where does it come from ? It 's about power , isn 't it ? Control . Who lives , who dies . Whoo . Forgive me . Hey , I know a lot of surgeons . At least you 're honest about it . Most are too egotistical to truly see themselves . The only reason our brains tell us we 're flawed is so that we find a way to be better . Besides ... there 's nothing wrong with the occasional ... evil thought . Somewhere you have to be ? More like a deadline I 've promised to keep . Well ... thanks for the drink . Leaving so soon ? You just said you have a deadline . Something tells me I 'm going to make it . This isn 't your fault . Yes , it is ... all of it . I brought John here . Every person he harms , it 's my fault . How were you supposed to know he was Jack the Ripper ? That 's not the point . He keeps killing people , and I can 't stop him . Every person he kills alters the future . These people ... they 're not supposed to die now . There 's no telling the damage it 's caused or what it 's destroyed . But you 're here . Aren 't you altering the timeline ? Yes , and I shouldn 't be . Time travel is meant for observation only . How can you be so sure of that ? We can talk science all day , but ... I don 't think you could take fate and destiny out of the equation . I think you were always supposed to come to New York . You and I were always supposed to meet . Because if this is just a mistake in the fabric of time , well , that would just suck . That would suck . I 'm sorry , I am babbling so much . No . No , no , no , never . When I met you , um , I must admit , I was first drawn to your beauty , the way you light up by merely being . And then , it was your kindness that emerged as your most luminous feature . But now I see that you are the sum of many parts , with your mind leading the way . I am completely blinded by you , Miss Walker ... Jane . Sorry . Phone . Yes , I see that . It 's my friend Paul . He may be able to help us . If Paul is right and he has the gemstone we need , we should be back at the time machine within the hour . I have long been fascinated by mechanically propelled vehicles . Turn left at the next light . And it talks , too ? This is amazing . I gather that the speed of the vehicle is controlled by that first foot lever , there . It 's called a gas pedal . The other one is the brake , for stopping . Tell me , Doug , how long have you worked for Vanessa ? 13 years . I was head of security at her company for eight years , then moved over to her personal detail for the last five . Before that , I was an army boy . Impressive . I 'll wait here . You have my cell if you need me . - Thank you , Doug . - Thank you . Jane , how are you ? - It 's good to see you . - Good to see you , too . Um , Paul , this is my friend George . George , this is Paul . - Hi , there . - Pleasure . Everyone 's gone for the night . It 's just me . This way . Sorry to bother you , but I didn 't know who else to call . No problem . I was hoping to hear from you someday . - May I ask ... what is this place ? - It 's the Gemology Institute . Paul is a gemologist . Well , I mainly work in trade now ... rare rocks and gemstones . You know , Coldplay was at the Garden last week . I thought about you . - Really , Coldplay ? - What is Coldplay ? Coldplay is a band . They have this one album that we both really like . You don 't know Coldplay ? No , I 'm sorry . George is from London . So is Coldplay . So , you have the alexandrite gemstone ? Yeah . It 's right up here . You know , Jane , you look really good . Thank you . So do you . Crossfit . I 've really been working my core , you know , upping my game at the gym . Shall we continue ? Yeah . I don 't have many for you to choose from , but please put the gloves on before you touch the stones . Take a look at what 's here . There may be a few more in the safe . Is that the right size ? Well , it needs to be type 1 with high clarity ... like these . Knock yourself out . So , are you still at the museum ? I took a couple weeks off . I 'm doing some consulting at Vanessa Anders ' foundation . - Awesome . - Yeah . - Is that what this is about ? - Yeah . - She 's gonna cover all the costs . - Great . So , you and , um ... - George . - George , yes ... a thing ? I 'll stop flirting with you if it is . I doubt that . Excuse me ? George and I are ... - friends . - Thought so . Paul , I am looking for something with a level-six tone . Level six , got it . I 'll check the safe . If it 's not too much trouble . I 'm sorry about that . Paul and I went out on a few dates . I should 've mentioned that before . You went out with him ? You seem surprised . He ... he doesn 't seem your type . Really ? And what is my type ? Someone , a little less congratulatory . Ignore him . He 's just being a guy . He completely lacks subtlety . Well , perhaps it 's all that crossfit . We went out a couple times and nothing came out of it . No sparks . " Sparks ? " You know ... that electricity between two people . That undefinable spark of attraction . You must have felt it before . You 've been married . Yes , I was married ... " was " being the operative word . What went wrong ? Isabel never really understood me . My passions to explore and discover , they ... they held no interest to her . And we both knew it wasn 't right . And how does one find the right person ? Or do they find us ? Perhaps fate does indeed play a hand . So , now you do believe in fate . I know you had a lot on your plate today . I really appreciate you coming back . This is where I want to be , Vanessa . I just ... I want to know what 's going on with you . - Vanessa ... - This isn 't easy , Griffin . Nothing about our relationship has been easy , but I love you . Whatever it is , I can handle it . What if I told you that George ... is really H.G. Wells , who traveled here in that time machine that is now sitting in my ballroom ? I would say , " You 've lost your damn mind . " My God , you 're serious . Y-you can 't possibly believe this . This is why I haven 't told you . Sweetheart , this guy is obviously playing you . Are you giving him money ? This is a DNA and genealogy test . I had it done on both of us . The results are conclusive ... we are related . You are a very wealthy woman . People know about your preoccupation with H.G. Wells and that you own the exhibit . Now you have some punk pretending to be Wells living in your home . He 's taking you for a ride . - I 'm gonna take care of this . - Don 't . I 'm not gonna sit back and watch him make a fool of you . I trusted you with this . Now I need you to trust me . Vanessa , I 'm really worried about you right now . I don 't know if I can . I know why you 're single . Yeah ? It 's because you 're a goddess searching for your equal , and you 'll settle for no less . Too intimate ? Did I discover another one of your issues ? Perhaps you did . Well , then I guess I won 't be asking you to stay the night . Were you going to ? It would be out of character for me , but ... yes . I was going to ... if your intimacy issues can handle it . Well , I think they can handle it . I 'm gonna go make a drink . Would you like one ? No , I 'm good , but you help yourself . I think I have what you 're looking for . Thank you . This is exactly what we need . You just need to sign for it . Let me get the papers . Thank you . Well ... your friend has redeemed himself . Good . Did you hear that ? Paul ? Is everything all right ? Paul ! Follow me , this way . Go , go , go . This way . I know you 're in here ! I know who you are , H.G. Wells . I know all about your time machine . I know about the Ripper , too . Go , go , go , go , go . No , no , no . Doug . Who 's the guy ? I heard gunshots . I-I don 't know , but I have seen this man before . He was following me . You two need to get out of here . I got this . Thank you . Paul will cooperate . I 'll pay for the damage , and he 'll keep quiet . Paul 's a good guy . We can trust him . I still do not understand why that man was trying to kill me . How did he know me and the Ripper ? All these years , I thought I was the only one who knew you 'd come to New York . Could he be someone I have yet to encounter ? Perhaps I met him in my future , but his past . That wouldn 't explain why he wanted to shoot you . Doug has a contact at the police department . He 'll call when they ID the body . It 's Martin . He 's ready for you to install the new gemstone . Initiating remote activation sequence now . Set the calibration to bring the time machine back to this very location a second after it launches in order to prevent another break in the time-space continuum . Vanessa ? I believe everyone here knows Griffin . Actions speak for themselves . Well , watch this . All the power levels are ready to accept the parameters . No way . How ? It 's incredible . So , that 's it ? The trap is ready ? John can get in , set whatever date he wants . He 's only gonna go where we want him to go . Great . Good evening , H.G. I 'm sending you a movie . Not one you 're going to enjoy , I 'm afraid , but I hope you 'll at least appreciate my clever application of modern technology . Though , unfortunately , I 'm unable to honor our deadline . I met a fascinating woman . In her company , I 've ... begun to feel all too ... human . But as we both know , what I truly am ... is an animal . There is no redemption for my soul , no matter the cost . Then , I must be true to my nature . But perhaps , it will bring you satisfaction to know that ... I will feel regret . It 's late ... to have music on . How do you still have the energy ? You inspire me . What did you do ? Delete . It 's about time . I was beginning to think you 'd gone soft . What have you done ? Ooh , blimey . Look at it . It 's bursting with energy . It 's fully live and operational , but John hasn 't called . Do you think he 's gonna kill again ? We shall catch him . Today , when that man had his gun pointed at you ... that was real ... too real . - You want out . - No . I want in . Yes , today was scary , but it proved something ... that I want to do this . Because somehow , I think I 'm supposed to be here . You asked me if I believe in fate . Well , Jane , I believe ... there are certain moments in one 's life that ... defy understanding . Moments that are rare and special ... and precious . And this moment ? I believe very much so that this moment was destined to happen . Did that just happen ? Well , it 's merely a thermionic emission - of electrons from the ... - Right . All good here . Worked like a charm . I now have access to the time machine . But there 's a problem ... someone else knows about Wells . We have to find out who else is out there . Good evening , Dr. Stevenson ... or do you prefer Jack the Ripper ? Who are you ? I 'm someone who 's been waiting a very long time to meet you . Shh .

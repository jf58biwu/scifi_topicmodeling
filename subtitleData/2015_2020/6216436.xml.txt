 Previously , on Between ... We are putting Pretty Lake under full quarantine . In the meantime , our military will use whatever force necessary on anyone trying to enter or leave the area . They 're leaving you people to die before you infect the rest of us . You know what , your brother is one sick ... Watch out ! - She 's dead . - We need to leave . I 'm sorry . You remind me your father . We are nothing alike . I apologize for the late hour , but you have something that belongs to me . I 'm here for my wife , Hanna . I 'm so sorry . So besides this kid , Adam , there appears to be no one else investigating what happened ? No . What do you know about Art Carey ? I found a canister on his body . I think it might be involved in the deaths . Please . Adam ... Dad . Adam . Adam , come on . Hey , wake up . Wake up . Come on . Come on . She hit you pretty hard . I think you passed out . I let you sleep as long as I could , but we gotta move . Come on . Hey , wait . What the hell is going on ? We don 't have time , okay ? Let 's go . Come on . Here . Go where ? I can get us out of here . How ? There is no way out . How do you think I got in ? Come on . Watch out ! Amanda ! Help me ! She just ran into the road . I didn 't see her . - Yeah , I know . - Where 'd she come from ? - She didn 't see the car ? - Amanda , come on ! She 's dead . - What are we gonna do ? - We have to leave . What 'd you find out ? No one knows anything for sure . But ? The pharmacy was broken into . The meds are missing . Creekers . Looks that way . You don 't just ... leave somebody in the street to die like that . You stay . You stay with her . You ... Round up the boys . Tell ' em to meet back here as soon as you can . Everybody comes armed . Wait , are you sure you know what you 're doing ? Yep . You 're up early . The cows needed to be milked . I 'm sorry . You don 't need to apologize for anything . Please , can you at least look at me ? You could 've told me you were married . Well , if you want an excuse , I couldn 't think of anything that didn 't sound completely weird . I also ... didn 't expect to find myself having feelings for someone so soon . Do you love him ? The marriage is what the community wanted . Instead of putting a stop to it , I just ... went along with it until ... I was married ... was a wife . So then why go back ? Because they need me . Because I can run away from John , but I can 't run away from my community . Well , then you better be getting back . Let me go back before they figure it out and try to explain this to Chuck . Yeah , and then he 'll know it was Pat for sure . Yeah , but maybe I can make him understand that it was an accident . And what scenario do you think ends up with him understanding ? If that happened to me , Pat or Ronnie , I wouldn 't be much in the mood for talking it out . Pat 's gone . Is Chuck okay ? Yeah . Any ideas who it was ? The Creekers . Look , everyone knows that your sister 's with them . You realize she has a target on her back as well , right ? Yeah . Is there any way that you can get to her and talk to her ? She 's never listened to me before . She 's not gonna start now . They don 't have anyone keeping guard . No one in the woods either . They don 't know we 're coming . Maybe they didn 't do it ... or they know and it 's a trap . There 's only one way to find out . Come on . - Uh , is ... is Chuck home ? - No . You expecting him back any time soon ? Yeah . No , sorry , uh ... No , I don 't think so . Why ? What 's up ? I killed Amanda . The house being empty doesn 't prove they didn 't do it . You 're gonna want to see this . You think this was here yesterday ? No . You ? No ... definitely not . Milk 's ready . If you 're not going into town , I 'll do it . You need to stay here . We both do . What about Melissa 's kids ? They need the milk . You ever wonder why he did it ? Did what ? You know . Every day . You ? I keep asking myself ... was it ' cause of the virus ... or was the virus just an excuse ? You 're not thinking of doing the same thing , are you , Gord ? No . I couldn 't do that to you . Then drive me into town . Okay . It was the Creekers . Yeah , I know . You do ? How ? Come here . Do you still have the geo coordinates to the tunnel ? - Yes . - We 're less than ten minutes away . Then we 'll get you out . What about you ? Doesn 't matter . Yes , it does . I 'm not leaving without you . Listen ... the tunnel , it 's an old utility corridor . Supposed to be a military base . Dad ... tell me you 're immune . The tunnel was finished , the site was scrapped , so it 's not on any maps . Stop talking about the tunnel . - Tell me you have the cure . - There is no cure . How do you know ? Because I worked on it . Get down . Get down . You had no right to guarantee that . Where 's Pat ? Look , he gave me his word , okay ? Will you do the same ? For a Creeker , that means nothing . Yeah , but he came here on his own and he wants to make this right . They 're early . What are they doing here ? The government sent them . But what the soldiers don 't know is that they 've been sent to exterminate everyone in Pretty Lake . The troops think that the injections are saving the kids , but the government lied to them . The soldiers , they wear these masks ... but there 's no protection against the virus . It 's only ever a matter of time before even they 'll be dead . You have to leave , now , while there 's still time . They can 't just kill us . Yes , they can . We have to warn people . No , there 's no time , Adam . You understand ? You have no choice . What about you ? It 's too late for me already . - I won 't just leave you here . - No . The moment I stepped into Pretty Lake , I knew I was dead . I came back for you , and if you don 't leave now , my death ... will be for nothing . Just go . I can 't , I ... - I have to warn ... - There 's no time , Adam . I love you . But I have to help Wiley . Dad . There are no cars parked here . You think Pat might be inside ? We 're running out of options , okay ? We searched everywhere else . Slowly . Where 's Pat ? Ronnie , put the gun down . Okay ? That goes for the rest of you guys . Hey , we 're not taking orders from you . Look , we just want Pat , okay ? Nobody needs to get hurt . Yeah , I agree , but Pat admitted that he killed Amanda , - and he wants this to end . - That 's bullshit . We have a way to settle this once and for all . They 're waiting for us at the church . I still haven 't heard your proposal . I 'm not gonna run anymore . I came into town so this ends . You want justice for your sister , and I 'm offering justice . Even death ? Yes , on one condition . Pat , don 't do this , okay ? It wasn 't your fault . You don 't need to die for this . Ronnie ... I don 't want any more people getting hurt . The retaliation has to end . Do you think if Chuck had done this to one of ours , we 'd be acting any differently ? No , we 'd want blood . I get that . And I 'm willing to suffer the consequences . I need promises from you and Chuck ... that this ends with me , no matter what . Chuck ? Whatever I decide ? Yeah . - Hey , Mel ? - Yeah ? How is your food supply holding up ? Uh , we 're running out . Okay , I can check some houses . Maybe I can scrounge something up . Looks like you won 't have to . Hey . Found these at the bar . Thanks . There 's more where that came from . Gord , look at this . What 's going on ? What was Samantha thinking ? She wasn 't supposed to send for everybody . Franny , watch the kids . Everybody knows that this is a fair and just punishment . Chuck , you don 't want to do this . Pat , don 't do this , please , okay ? We can fight our way out of this . Not without getting hurt . Ronnie , you made a promise . I have your word . This has to be done . Anything else you want to say before I pull the trigger ? No , I 'm done talking . Chuck , stop . This is wrong . - Wiley , get out of the way . - No . I was there , too . If you shoot him , then you 're gonna shoot me first . She 's lying . I was by myself . Wiley , this isn 't your fight . Yes , it is . I could 've stayed , and I didn 't . I don 't know what your game is , but you 're lying . You 're lying . No , she isn 't . Tell them , Melissa . Last night , before it happened , I caught them at the pharmacy . She was with Pat . - Stop , Melissa . She 's your sister . - No . No , she 's finally taking responsibility for her actions ... and for her sins . Aren 't you , Wiley ? Yeah , that 's right . Mom and Dad would be so proud . I don 't care ! Look ... he was driving ! No , shoot me . Why don 't you tell Chuck who the father is ? Thought I didn 't know , didn 't you ? Melissa , stay out of this . If you don 't tell him , I will . You don 't know what you 're talking about . This ends now ! Wiley , move ! Tell him ! It 's your father , Chuck . Is that your phone ? What 's going on ? Residents of Pretty Lake , we have found a cure to stop the spread of the disease . So before the quarantine can be lifted , absolutely everyone must receive an inoculation . This must be done quickly and efficiently , as our soldiers are still at risk of airborne exposure . Please make your way to the penitentiary immediately . Thank you for your cooperation . It 's over . I can 't believe it . Chuck ... put the gun down . Is that true ? This is my brother ? Yeah . How ? Um ... His name is Jason . Jason ? Yeah . Let 's get out of here . Come on . You and I aren 't finished . Stop . No one 's going anywhere . They 've come to kill us . How much time left ? Just over four hours before we need to evac Pretty Lake . That doesn 't seem like much time to round up 1,000 kids . Stop . There 's a large group in that church . Call for more transport . Adam , this is ridiculous . How do you even know that what your father told you is true ? You have to believe me . There is no cure . Okay , enough with the conspiracy theories . Why would the government want us dead ? They 're cleaning up their mess . Yo , that doesn 't make sense . All right , give us one good reason we should believe you . Think about everything that 's happened , from the outbreak to the quarantine . There are more questions than answers . For one , why haven 't we been able to contact the outside ? Well , the power going out would 've blown the cell towers . Then what about the landlines ... or TVs ? Why don 't they work ? We can 't use walkies either , and they ... they don 't need a tower . They 've declared the area a no-fly zone . Think about what happened to Vince and Kevin in the plane . My guess , the same thing would happen to anyone trying to fly in . It 's clear they don 't want us talking or knowing anything . This is a huge cover-up . All right , everyone . There 's no time to waste . We must leave immediately . Okay , guys , keep moving . We gotta go . - Good job . That 's it . - What about my brother ? We 'll get everyone . Don 't worry . Please , keep moving . Please , everyone , we need you to come with us . I need to get to my sister . There 's no time . You guys should 've been heading to the prison already . She 's just in the other room . I promise I 'll bring her right back . Sorry , that just can 't happen . - How do we know this isn 't a trap ? - A trap ? We 're risking our lives to help you . We only have so much time before we could become infected . Prove to me that we aren 't being sent to our deaths . Listen , I don 't have time for this . The decontaminations need to happen as quickly as possible , so move . Or what ? - Hey ! - What are you doing ? He was just asking a question . You didn 't have to do that . Yes , we did . We are under severe time restrictions . You know what ? I believe Adam . Me , too . Hey . - Get down . - Don 't move . Okay , okay . If Adam 's wrong , we 're all screwed . Frances . I was starting to wonder if the quarantine would ever be lifted . I know , it 's incredible , isn 't it ? - Is ... is Gord around ? - No , he wasn 't in the van . Let 's keep moving , please . Well , when you see him , can you tell him I was asking for him ? I 'm sure he 'll be glad to hear it . Okay . Okay , kids . Right this way . So , you saw your dad ? He came back . He tried to save me . Did he fail or did you come back ? A bit of both , I guess . Probably the biggest mistake of your life . I 'm already starting to think exactly the same thing . Well , thank you . It means a lot . Okay , Wiley and Melissa are gonna stay here with Jason . The rest of you are with me . If Adam 's right , there 's not much time before the soldiers die from the virus . Before that , we have to prevent them from injecting as many kids as possible . If we can get to the prison control room , we can lock this place down and end this decontamination process . If we lock all the doors , they 'll focus on trying to get out and stop injecting the kids . Then we wait for the soldiers to die . I just wish I knew my way around . I don 't have a map or anything . I think I can help . How ? I was an inmate . Okay , Cassidy , you 're next . Come on , kiddo . Have a seat right there . How you feeling ? I just wish we weren 't putting everything on a long shot . When did you know ? One day , I came early to pick you up from your job at the dealership , and I saw the two of you in his office . You saw ? Not enough to know for sure , but I suspected as much . Why didn 't you say anything ? We weren 't exactly the closest , Wiley . And when you told Mom and Dad that you were pregnant and keeping the baby , I knew why you 'd done it . - Why ? - To hurt them . You think I did this to hurt them ? What other reason could there be ? Well , because maybe there was something between us that actually mattered ... Shh ! Someone 's coming . Wiley , we have to hide . Okay , everyone . This is it . Handcuffs on . Let 's move it . Everybody out . This group goes to cell block B. Are you sure you can find the control room ? Spent enough time here . Yeah . What were you in for ? Jaywalking . I don 't like this at all ... breaking into a prison . You got a better idea ? No . I guess we 're in this together . Who would 've guessed ? Yeah , who would 've guessed ? Okay , let 's go . Hey , hey . What 's going on ? These guys resisted . They say they don 't want to be decontaminated . Hard to believe you kids want to stay that badly . Don 't you understand what we 're risking for you ? Doesn 't make sense to me either . Move . Corridor five . Corridor five . Copy that . Move it . Watch out , they 're on the move . So make a right . - Let 's go , people . - Keep moving . We 're almost there . - Where to ? - This way . Hey ! What are you guys doing here ? We 're taking these kids to be decontaminated . That 's back the way you came from ! - Hey . - No need for that . Adam , go . Get these guys to the control room . Chuck and I will hold them here . I 'm not leaving you here with him after what happened at the church . You 'll be more useful to them . Just go , Ronnie . Come on . You guys are making a mistake . Shut up . Why did you do it ? Um ... You know , he listened to me . It wasn 't planned . It 's not like I ever thought of him that way or anything . Suddenly , we just kind of had ... a connection . We both felt really bad about it . If you would 've seen him , then you 'd know how sorry he was . And then I got pregnant . A guy like Charles Lotts is expected to know better . You ... you , I understand . I 'm not a victim , Melissa . I chose to have this baby . Shit ! What are you two doing ? You 're supposed to report to the jail for decontamination . Come on , let 's go . All right , flat on the floor . Hands behind your back , now . - Let 's go . - You don 't want to do this . Stop ! Drop your weapon ! You guys all right ? - We 're okay . - Go ! I think they 're headed to the control room . - Okay , where to now ? - It 's just down here . Wait . Let me check it out first . - Stop ! Identify yourself ! - Shit ! We 're screwed . - Adam , go now . I 'll cover you . - Identify yourself ! It 's down the hall . Second door on your right . You 're not coming ? If this goes south , I 'll need to get them out . Go , Adam ! You need to lock it down to stop the injections ! Run ! Stop . You don 't know what you 're doing . You 're supposed to be dead . People believe what they want to believe . Bile isn 't so hard to fake . You wouldn 't listen . All you had to ... All you had to do was leave . I didn 't want you to see any of this . Why 'd you come back ? I couldn 't go knowing everyone would be killed . Hmm . I had to at least try to save ' em . No , they can 't be saved . It 's too late . - Adam ... - I can , I can save them ... Stop . Adam , stop . 'Cause even if there was a chance that you could save those kids ... you risk infecting everyone else on Earth . Look , no prison is 100 % secure , and we feel it 's only a matter of time before someone escapes . " We " ? What do you mean , " we " ? I synthesized the pathogen by splicing a viral genome with my own ... my DNA . And that 's why you 're immune . Because it 's already a part of you . It 's a part of me . And we 're the only two that can leave here without infecting others . Everyone else here is a carrier . Melissa , we have to do something . Wiley , how can you even be sure that Adam 's right ? I trust him . It makes sense , okay ? Please ! Let us go ! The decontaminations are gonna kill us ! Please , you 're sending us to our deaths ! Let us go ! Wiley , stop it . You 're gonna piss them off . Just shut up ! We 're less than a minute from the prison . Craig , what 's wrong ? Craig ! Craig ! You 're lying . Why should I believe you ? Nothing you 've said is true . If you and I are the only ones immune , why aren 't they dead then ? They will be , when they turn 22 . Because it 's tapped into their biological clocks . This doesn 't make sense . Why design a virus like this ? What for ? The projections on population growth ... they 're terrifying . And it was in our best interest to look for a solution . This is about population control . You know we 're past the tipping point in greenhouse gas emissions ? Food ? Water ? How long do you think we have before those resources run out ? This is not science fiction , Adam . This planet cannot be sustained . The virus was engineered to thin the population . To cull the weak and the elderly to give the rest of us a chance . A chance at survival . But it worked too well . All it needs is to penetrate one host cell , and it will replicate aggressively . And you cannot stop it once it 's begun . So this was a test . What ? - This was a test on innocent people . - No , of course not . We didn 't even try it on mice . Look ... there was a scientist , who , uh ... Art Carey ? Yes . Art and I never did see eye to eye . And when he went rogue ... I knew I was in danger , so I disappeared . I thought that would buy me some protection until I could find him . I thought that it would save you from getting hurt . And ... I was wrong . Why are you here ? I came back to get you out . To clean up this mess . To murder everyone . No , no . We 've gotta stop the virus before it spreads . And the only way to do that is to kill all the carriers . You see that , don 't you , Adam ? That is the humane thing to do . - Any clue where we are ? - No . - You hear something ? - No , you ? Let 's keep going up , see if we can get to the roof . Okay . I hear them . They 're down there ! Stop ! Do not move ! Go , go , go , go ! Shit . I 'm out . Well , what are we gonna do ? - We should go back . - Let 's go . Go ! Hands up ! Or I 'll shoot ! Guns on the ground , now ! Right here . Have a seat . Adam . You step away from the controls , I will save you . I can 't let you kill everyone . I can 't . There has to be another way . I 've told you everything , Adam . You know that there isn 't . - Come on , I 'm not ... - Hey , hey . Stop . Stop , or I 'll shoot . I mean it . No , you won 't . 'Cause you understand that I 'm right . That at least you can save yourself . - At least ... - Stop , or I 'll shoot ! Okay , you and I both know that you 're not gonna shoot me . We don 't have time for this , Adam . I 'm on your side ! I need to stop this . Trust me ! Please ! Now , our operatives can 't resist the virus much longer , even with the suits . You have to trust me , Adam . - Stop . Stop . I said stop ! - No ! Adam ! I love you . And I know you 're gonna do the right thing . I 'm sorry . Like lambs to the slaughter . Go , go ! Stop ! We got ' em . I 'm out . - We 're screwed . - Seems like it . Look , it 's important for you to know ... your sister 's death was an accident . Do you believe me ? Yeah , I do . Good . Stay here . Attention . The control room has been compromised . Mission has been aborted . All military personnel must evacuate the prison immediately . I repeat , evacuate the prison immediately . Melissa ? Melissa , wake up , come on . No , come on , wake up ! Melissa . Melissa , come on ! - You think it 's a trap ? - No . They 're dead from the virus . I need to find Franny . It 's this way . What happened ? Your brother saved my life . Franny ! Franny ? I was next , Gord . I was next . Did you see them ? Why did they need to kill us ? What harm could we have done ? You know , we did everything they asked . They wouldn 't have done something like this if they knew they were going to die . That they were killing kids . Then why ? They were lied to . Everyone 's been lied to . This isn 't over . They 'll be back . So , what are we supposed to do now ? Just wait around to die ? No . Then what ? I have a way out .

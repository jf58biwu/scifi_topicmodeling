Every four days , there 's a million more people on the planet . How is the world gonna cope with this explosion in population ? ( man 2 ) The UN predicts that , by the end of the decade , we will have a population of ten billion . ( Obama ) I am a firm believer that climate change is real , that it is impacted by human behavior . ( man ) The government has declared most of South America a disaster zone . ( woman ) Extreme drought and massive dust storms have shut down the Earth 's entire agricultural system . ( man ) Too many people , not enough food . ( man 2 ) In an effort to combat the food shortage , the European Federation has placed the world 's future in the hands of science . The development of more resilient , high-yield , genetically modified crops is being fast-tracked around the globe . Shelves once empty are now fully-stocked . ( woman ) But the tinkering with nature has created long-term consequences . Across the world , we are witnessing a staggering spike in multiple births and genetic defects . ( man ) The solution is now feeding the problem . ( man 2 ) It is the biggest crisis in human history . ( woman ) Political activist and renowned conservation biologist Dr. Nicolette Cayman has prompted the Federation to institute a " one child per family " policy called the " Child Allocation Act . " We are one human family sharing this Earth . Today , together , we make history . The Child Allocation Act is the first vital step towards preserving our planet and making a better future for our children . ( man ) New legislation has been swift . Check points have been erected across the nation . All citizens are required to wear a Bureau-issued identity bracelet . And , from this day forth , illegally conceived siblings will be remanded to Bureau-enforced cryosleep . Children are more than just children . They are the future . With cryosleep , we 'll make sure your child rests peacefully , humanely , free from hunger , safe from harm , while we work to build a better , brighter future . Cryosleep . Awake to a better world . I know there 's ... maybe a little resistance , but , with the " one child " policy ... it may give us some time . ( babies crying ) I 'm so sorry , Mr. Settman . We did everything we could . If we were better equipped , there 's a chance we might 've been able to saved her . She knew the risks . She knew you wouldn 't report her . - And the father ? - Who knows ? My daughter ... We haven 't spoken in years . How do you plan on hiding this ? How will you cope ? I 'll manage . I 'll have to . Have you thought about names ? Well ... There are seven . So ... Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday , and Sunday .

( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( electronic beeping ) This sibling is now listed and will be processed under authority of the Child Allocation Act . - ( crowd clamoring ) - ( crying ) No ! No ! My baby ! ( sobbing ) ( crowd clamoring ) - ( woman ) My baby ! - ( boy ) She 's my sister ! Can I have that one ? ( door buzzing ) ( man ) " What happens to a dream deferred ? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun , or fester like a sore and then run ? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load . Or does it explode ? " I like it . Did you write that ? - ( elevator dings ) - No , ma 'am . That 's the great Langston Hughes , jazz king of Harlem . Haven 't I already told you that ? Must have slipped my mind . Tell me , Miss Settman , what 's your secret ? Last night , you 're puking in the planter , but , today , you 're looking fresh as a daisy . ( chuckles ) ( elevator dings ) ( electronic buzzing ) ( rapid beeping ) ( door unlocks ) Dinner is served . - That 's interesting . - Spreadsheets for tomorrow . - I 'm starving . - ( indistinct chatter ) - You are always starving . - I think you might have worms . - ( indistinct chatter ) - Oh , come on , Saturday . I hope I have worms . We can cook them next week . ( giggling ) - Ugh , that 's gross . - It 's delicious . It 's kind of beautiful . - It 's a fucking rat . - It 's actually quite good . At least , it tastes like something , unlike that engineered shit you 're eating . Oh , come on , Wednesday . You 'd eat anything . - Deep-fried pig dick on a stick . - ( laughter ) You 'd buy it and you 'd eat it . ( laughter ) - ( burps ) - ( laughter continues ) Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . - You seem ... I know . It 's just ... my big presentation is tomorrow . You mean " our " presentation . No thanks to you getting shitfaced last night . Yeah , Eddie said you threw up in the planter . I didn 't know what to say . I felt really embarrassed . I was entertaining one of our clients . I might have overdone it on the martinis . Shoot me . You have to tell us everything , Saturday . How can you be so stupid ? ( sighs ) I 'm just tired . Tomorrow 's a big day . If we get this promotion , it 's all thanks to Friday . She makes us all look like a genius . ( mutters ) It 's a team effort . You guys did the legwork . I just crunch numbers . Seven minds are better than one . ( man ) You must work collectively . You 're stronger together than you are alone . In time , we will select a career that capitalizes on your joint skills . What are you waiting for ? Go on , go on . Solve the problem . May I see ? Very good . ( blowing whistle ) ( clapping ) Go , go , go , go , go ! ( sighs ) ( sighs ) - ( bracelet beeping , whirring ) - Pay attention , girls . Tomorrow ... is a big day . You know how there are seven days in the week . Well , starting tomorrow , you will each get to go outside on the day of the week that is your name . That means Sunday will get to go outside on Sunday , Monday on Monday , Tuesday on Tuesday , and so on . In here , I want you to be who you are , dress the way you wish . I want you to be creative and express yourself . But , outside of these walls , you will all take on the singular identity of Karen Settman , named after your mother . - Can I play outside ? - Yes , you can , as long as it 's your day . But you can never go outside together at the same time , ever . Even with your bracelet . And , wherever you are and whatever you 're doing ... you can never tell a soul that you 're a sibling . That 's very important . You understand ? Okay . Well , we begin tomorrow . Starting with you , Thursday . ( man sighs ) You ready to do this ? ( breathes deeply ) Okay . - ( indistinct chatter ) - ( moans ) ( automated voice ) The following items may not be taken through checkpoints without prior permission : any sharp objects , flammables , or chemicals . - ( rapid beeping ) - For your safety and security , have your bags ready for inspection by an enforcement officer . Please have your wristbands ready for inspection . No unauthorized persons are allowed to enter the sector . ( metal clanging ) Don 't forget , you 're the one and only Karen Settman . The end of the day meeting is the most important part of your day . It 's the time to share every detail with your siblings . Okay ? ( powers on ) ( beeps ) ( beeps ) ( indistinct chatter ) Mm ... ( loud clamoring ) ( beeps ) - Oh , God . - Poor kid . Straight to the cryobank . With Cayman running for Parliament , security 's getting tighter . I fucking hate that bitch . I don 't know . Maybe cryosleep isn 't such a bad idea . We turn ourselves in , get frozen , play Sleeping Beauty until the population drops . ( sighs ) I heard you still dream , like , horrible nightmares for hundreds of years . By the time you wake up , everyone you know and love will be gone . Well , we go to sleep together , we wake up together . The Child Allocation Act will be a thing of the past , and we can finally live our own lives . Are we really gonna have this conversation again ? Why can 't you just accept that this is your family ? This isn 't a family . It 's a repressive regime . I didn 't pick this life any more than you did . Yet you live it so perfectly . Karen Settman from cradle to grave . - It 's disgusting . - ( scoffs ) What do you care ? Your only ambition was to be a total loser , which you are . Fuck you , Monday . Just because I have my own personality and dreams , and I want to have a relationship that is more than just a random fuck with someone that I will never see again ? I 'm sick to death of Miss Karen fucking Settman . Karen Settman is the foundation we built our lives on . No , she 's a mask , a mask we put on one day a week . One day a week we can go out into the real world , and we can 't even be ourselves . - We have to be a fake person . - Oh , shut up , both of you ! - You 're driving us all crazy . - Yeah , this is our life . It is what it is . Being trapped in this prison six days a week isn 't a life . It 's a slow , agonizing , soul-sucking death . ( sighs ) ( piano playing faintly ) ( breathes deeply ) ( piano playing ) Move over ! Saturday , let 's go . Or you 'll be late for your recital . ( piano continues playing ) ( door closing ) So ... you didn 't see her leave ... and you don 't have any idea where she might be . Well ... - When did you see her last ? - ( knocking on door ) ( suspenseful music playing ) - ( floorboard clattering ) - ( beeps ) ( beeping ) ( exhales deeply ) ( gun cocking ) ( moans ) ( panting ) ( suspenseful music playing ) I was just skating and I fell ! I did ! ( crying ) - Oh ... - ( whimpers ) ( whimpering ) Oh , Thursday ... ( groaning ) What if the Bureau caught you ? One mistake is all it takes to put all your lives at risk . I hate Karen Settman ! I wish I had never been born ! Enough ! You want to get taken away ? Get frozen for all eternity in that god-awful machine and never see me or your sisters again ? Go . Monday . I warned you . Everything you do affects each other . ( ominous music playing ) - What 's that for ? - Keep still . ( groans ) ( clicking ) What happens to one of you ... happens to you all . Monday ... I need you to be brave . Set an example for your sisters . Will it hurt ? Yes . Don 't move . ( screams ) ( shower running ) I bet that rat tasted better going down . - Shut up . - ( shower curtains closing ) You 're burning up . You running a fever ? No . - You sure ? - I 'm fine . ( vomits , coughs ) - Maybe you should switch days . - I can do Monday . Success does not come without sacrifice and struggle . ( sighs ) Shut the fuck up . ( buzzing ) ( elevator whirring ) ( elevator dings ) " Beneath the tall tree , while night comes on gently , dark like me . " Langston Hughes again , Eddie . - You sound like a broken record . - And a good day to you , too .

The following items may not be taken through checkpoints without prior permission : any sharp objects , flammables , or chemicals . For your safety and security , have your bags ready for inspection ... - Someone 's in a rush , huh ? - By an enforcement officer . Big day at work . These lines are getting worse . Last week , a woman gave birth right here because she couldn 't get through . - No kidding . - Of course , it had to happen on my day . Mondays are the worst . I hate checkpoint duty . Except I get to see you . ( beeping ) I 'm afraid I have to ask you a couple of questions . The Bureau 's a stickler for protocol . You understand . - What 's your name ? - Karen Settman . - Karen , do you have any siblings ? - No . You carrying any contraband ? No . Are you sure ? - Do I have to body search you ? - ( chuckles ) ( thunder rumbling ) You may proceed . - Karen . - Jerry . ( elevator whirring ) ( sighs ) So ... Today 's the big day , huh ? We 'll see who gets the promotion . All these years , I 've been trying to figure out your angle . I always thought , with a body like that , you 'd fuck your way to the top . But then it turns out , you 're a frigid bitch . - Just because I find you repulsive ? - ( chuckles ) You 're not interested in anyone . Working here , night after night , like a fucking robot . You think you have us all fooled , don 't you ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . Yes , you do . ( elevator dings , doors open ) Karen . I 'm onto you . ( suspenseful music playing ) ( clock chiming ) ( chiming continues faintly ) Where the hell is she ? - Did you try her again ? - Yeah . Straight to voicemail . - Maybe she got held up . - She would have called . Ping her bracelet . - That 's weird . - What ? Her GPS locator is off . She 's not showing up on the grid . - She can 't just vanish . - Oh , yes , you can ... if you want to . Maybe she was in an accident . Run a search . Um , hospitals , police records . What if Monday 's hurt ? Or dead ? And the authorities find her before we do ? ( gasps ) Then ... Karen Settman no longer exists . And our lives are over . Jeez , she 's only a few minutes late . Monday 's never been late for an end of day meeting . ( sighs ) Ever . ( dings , buzzes ) ( breathes deeply ) ( sighs ) " Eyes bloodshot from excessive drug use and emotional distress . Dark circles under the eyes ... " ( voice fading out ) - Ow ! - Stay still . Really ? Pot brownie ? It 's medicinal . You know it 's good for my nerves . ( exhales deeply ) I have a bad feeling about this . Remember what happened last time two of us were out there at once . That was bad . We gotta figure out where Monday is . You gotta act as if everything is normal . Easy for you to say . It 's not your day . What if we 've been listed ? Listen to me . If Karen Settman 's been listed , the Bureau would 've kicked in the door , and we 'd all be processed by now . Well ... technically speaking , one of us would get to live . ( sighs ) ( elevator whirring ) - Good morning , Miss Settman . - Good morning , Eddie . I didn 't see you come home yesterday . ( chuckles ) After hours . Let myself in . ( indistinct chatter ) ( automated voice ) may not be taken through checkpoints without prior permission : any sharp objects , flammables , or chemicals . For your safety and security , have your bag ready for inspection by an enforcement officer . She 's through . ( beeps ) So , we got our promotion . Stay focused , Tuesday . Check the calendar , desktop , anything that might give us a clue . ( door opens ) I 've got the brief for your conference call . Vicky , when was the last time you synched my tablet ? 9 : 03 this morning . Why ? Um , I forgot to log out last night . You left early to celebrate . ( chuckles ) Yes , of course . Um ... ( chuckles ) Where did I go again ? Your favorite bar . Harry 's . ( chuckles ) Yes , of course . Harry 's . Thanks . You 're welcome . ( door closes ) ( suspenseful music playing ) - ( sighs ) Cheers . - Cheers . Mm ... ( chuckles ) Last night , um ... do you remember what ... what time I left ? You only stayed for one drink . You barely touched it . I think that colleague of yours put you off . Yeah . God , yeah . Which one of them ? You know , that douchebag in the suspenders . - Jerry , I think ? - Yeah . Monday and Jerry argued just before she left the bar . ( scoffs ) He 's onto us . - I knew it . - Fucking dick sold us out . Then why aren 't we listed ? You 've got to corner him , Tuesday . - Find out what he knows . - Are you nuts ? He could be the last person who saw Monday . ( sighs ) - He 's our only lead . - Yeah , okay . ( suspenseful music playing ) ( woman ) Miss Settman . Yes ? Step into the van , please . Is there a problem ? I don 't understand . Who are you ? ( suspenseful music playing ) Step into the fucking van . ( beeping ) ( beeping ) Wha ... ? That 's weird . I lost her . ( beeping continues ) ( suspenseful music playing ) There 's obviously been a mistake . Can you please tell me what I 'm doing here ? ( woman ) Miss Settman . What a pleasure to meet you . Nicolette Cayman . I know who you are . Uh ... Can you please tell me why I 'm here ? You poor child . I am amazed you made it this far . This is ... This is all a big mistake . Seven children . What was your grandfather thinking ? Do you have any idea how much food and water was taken out of others ' mouths so you could be here today ? If everyone were as cruel and selfish as Terrence Settman , the world would end tomorrow . I am an only child . For your sake , I wish that were true . There are five of them left . All the rotten eggs in one basket . - Is there another way ? - Not if you want to keep it quiet . ( muttering ) What are you doing ? Um ... ( breathing heavily ) I-I work in a bank ! I can get you money ! Please ! Please ! We can make some kind of deal ! Please ! Funny . That 's what the last one said . No , wait ! No ! No , please , no ! No , no , no , no ! ( screaming ) ( beeping ) ( panting ) ( beeping continues ) I can 't believe this is happening . We can 't just sit here . We gotta help her . We gotta ... We gotta go out there . We gotta do something ! ( breathing heavily ) ( gasps ) Thursday ... ( beeping ) Oh , my God . What the ... ? ( weapon beeping , whirring ) Residents or visitors ? Visitors . ( suspenseful music playing ) ( breathing heavily ) - Shh ... - ( whimpers ) ( floorboard sliding ) ( beeping ) ( gasps ) Step out . All of you . - Now ! - ( gasps ) That 's it . Nice and slow . Nice and slow . This way . Look at them . Hiding like rats . So ... Where 's the last one ? Fuck you . ( floor creaking ) ( weapon beeps ) - ( Thursday yells ) - ( grunts ) ( grunting ) - ( weapon beeps ) - ( panting ) - ( cocks weapon ) - ( Thursday mutters ) ( man groans ) ( both grunting ) ( yells , grunts ) - ( groans ) - ( panting ) ( man grunts ) You fucking cunt ! ( glass clinking ) ( glass shattering ) ( Wednesday groaning ) ( screams ) ( grunting ) - ( sighs ) - ( yells ) ( yells ) ( man ) Fucking cu ... ( both grunting ) ( Saturday screaming ) ( glass shattering ) ( breathing heavily ) ( grunts ) ( groans ) ( both breathing heavily ) - ( weapon firing ) - ( man grunts ) ( weapon firing ) ( grunting ) - ( grunting ) - ( weapon beeping , whirring ) ( breathing heavily ) ( groaning ) ( continues groaning ) ( breathing heavily ) Is it bad ? It 's okay . Look at me . I don 't want to die . I don 't want to die . You 're gonna be okay . I 'm here . It 's okay . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . No . You 're Sunday . You 're supposed to be the believer . I don 't know what I believe . I don 't ... I don 't know who I am . ( crying ) No ! ( sobbing ) No ! No ! ( sobbing ) No ! Goddamn it ! ( Cayman ) They won 't suffer . - Excuse me ? - I 'm assured of that . Um ... We may have a containment problem . We still haven 't heard back from the Settman team . Last night , I dreamed this whole building erupted and spewed out all the siblings . There were so many of them . A sea of little bodies ... scorched by flames . I know what you feel for these children . But this is on their parents , not you . Sometimes , I think , " To hell with it . " To hell with everybody . Humans will never learn . You 're our last chance , Dr. Cayman . Our only hope . I need you , Joe . Be careful . Do not underestimate the Settmans . If we officially list them , they 'll be flagged at the first checkpoint and processed within hours . Seven siblings surviving to adulthood ? It would destroy my credibility . No . We have to keep this localized . They are trapped inside that apartment and they know it . Besides ... we have another issue . A complication . Make that a priority . Then deal with the Settmans . ( retches , coughs ) ( beeping ) It 's Tuesday 's . ( sighs ) No ... ( Saturday cries ) ( clock chimes ) ( mutters ) What the fuck are we doing ? Huh ? We gotta get out of here now . They know about us . They 're gonna send more people . Let them come . I 'll fucking kill them all . Calm down . Just think for a second . Four of us out there at once ? With all the Bureau agents and checkpoints and sensors ? ( scoffs ) We won 't last for two minutes . We always work best as a team ... in an environment we can control . Those guys , they weren 't Bureau . Or we 'd be listed by now , and this place would be crawling with agents . Somebody wants us to disappear . - ( whirring ) - ( breathing heavily ) The question is why . ( dings , buzzes ) ( scoffs ) Fuck it . Every Wednesday , I wear a stupid dress and high heels . Not today . - What 's that ? - Something I wish I thought of yesterday . I customized it , so we 'll see and hear everything you do . It 's a user-locked grip . - ( weapon beeps ) - Can you unlock it ? If I had more time . For now , it 's not gonna fire . - Doesn 't make it any less intimidating . - This isn 't a game , Wednesday . Go to Jerry 's . Find out what he knows . Don 't lose your head out there . I won 't . Cryosleep . Awake to a better world . ( doorbell ringing ) ( thunder rumbling ) Hello , Karen . You 're cutting it close . Aren 't you ? Please . Rough night ? ( chuckles ) Well , I did say you had until this morning , and it 's still morning , I guess , technically , so ... ( thunder rumbling ) What 's it gonna be ? What 's what gonna be ? Do we have a deal or not ? Deal ... What deal ? Playing dumb doesn 't suit ya , Settman . This is very simple . You pass on the promotion . It goes to me . And I keep my mouth shut about your little secret . ( thunder rumbling ) You motherfucker ! - ( scoffs ) - ( chuckles ) How long have you known ? - Huh ? - ( chuckles nervously ) You should be glad it was me who found that contract , or you 'd be in jail by now . ( Wednesday ) What contract ? - Are you serious ? - What fucking contract ? 407-C funds transfer . Your contract with Cayman . Cayman . ( thunder rumbling ) Nicolette Cayman . Yeah . Your new VIP client . Do you guys know about this ? ( sighs ) ( chuckles ) Wow . ( chuckles ) This , um ... This contract , wh ... where is it ? On my tablet . Show it to me . Yeah . - ( weapon firing ) - ( glass shattering ) ( gasps ) Get out of there ! ( weapon beeping ) Lost sight of the target . - Going in . Hold position . - ( siren wailing ) ( suspenseful music playing ) Guys ? You there ? Which way ? Where do I go ? ( suspenseful music playing ) Best option is front door . - Spread out . - That 's not an option . ( breathing heavily ) ( water dripping ) ( faint clattering ) ( breathing heavily ) Oh , shit . Erickson ? Erickson , copy . ( over radio ) Erickson . ( grunts ) ( suspenseful music playing ) ( beeping , whirring ) ( yelling ) ( man over radio ) Sir ? Sir , do you copy ? What 's going on up there ? Do you need backup ? ( weapon beeping , whirring ) Guess so . Move it ! Take the sibling down . ( thunder rumbling ) Girls ? I need a way out , now . There , a dumpster , below the bedroom window . - Come on . - It 's a three-story drop , but the trash will soften the impact . ( computer dings ) You better be right , sis . ( metal clanging ) ( wheezing , groaning ) Fuck ! It 's empty . The trash collection is every Wednesday morning . Sorry . ( groans ) Are you okay ? - Can you run ? - I think so . ( grunting ) Then run . ( suspenseful music playing ) Go , go , go ! Guys , where am I going ? Next left . There 's a door at the end of the alley . ( siren wailing in distance ) ( indistinct chatter ) ( people cheering ) ( suspenseful music playing ) - ( screams ) - ( tires squealing ) Come on . What are you waiting for ? Go get her ! ( woman ) Everybody move ! Move ! Get out of the fucking way ! - Get out of the way ! - Move ! ( Wednesday ) What do I do ? We need to get you on the roof . I can get you home from there . Hold tight . - ( knocking on door ) - ( suspenseful music playing ) ( beeping ) - Oh , shit . - It 's the Bureau . - I thought you said we 're not listed . - We 're not . - Then what the fuck is he doing here ? - Friday ? Friday ! ( knocking continues ) Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! Wait ! - What are you gonna do ? - Find out what he wants . And get rid of him . I got this . ( man knocking ) Hey , open up ! ( suspenseful music playing ) ( chuckles ) - Hey . - Hey . New look ? Y-Yeah . Yeah , I wanted to , um ... try something new . Nice . ( chuckles ) Um , I called your ... your office . They said you were out sick . I know . I know I 'm not supposed to call , - but when I saw you at the Bureau , I was ... - The ... The Bureau ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I had to go and , um ... drop off some stuff . Boring bank stuff . Aren 't you going to invite me in ? I was only joking about the forced entry . ( both chuckle ) ( Wednesday ) Friday ? ( whispering ) Hold on . We 've got a situation . You 've got a situation ? ( beeps ) It 's a nice place . Friday ? You there ? ( machinery clanking , hissing ) ( whispering ) Who the fuck is this guy ? ( grunts ) Please don 't do that . What ? Are you ... Are you serious ? Sorry , I thought you liked that stuff . I 'm ... Just , um ... Just ... give me a sec . - I 'll be right back . - Okay . ( mouthing words ) - What the hell is going on ? - You tell me . Who is that guy ? Don 't bullshit me . Have you been seeing him ? What ? No . He 's a Bureau agent . Do you think I 'm fucking stupid ? - You two seemed very familiar . - ( scoffs ) It 's called acting . How do I know you 're not acting now and you 've been seeing him all along ? ( sighs ) I 've never seen him in my life , I swear to God . You need to ... to get him to take you to his place and find out which one of us he 's been seeing . - What ? - Yeah , find out what he knows . Have you lost it completely ? You want me to go with him ? ( beeps ) - Yeah . - I think he wants to fuck me . Well , no shit . - Show me your bracelet . - Why ? It 's a coupling device from the dead guy 's bracelet . All you need to do is get yours close to his . ( muttering ) Wait . What ? Just activate your bracelet and connect it to that guy 's , and we get a gateway into the Bureau 's servers . ( sighs ) What if he catches me ? Well , I 'm sure you know a few tricks to distract him . Well , I don 't know any tricks . What do you mean ? All your big talk ... You 've never been with anyone ? I 'll be right there ! Oh , God ! Wednesday ! Oh , shit ! - We 're back . - ( Wednesday ) About time . - ( computer dings ) - There 's , uh , roof access . The last door , southwest corner . ( suspenseful music playing ) Guys ... There is no way I can clear this . There 's only two ways out of this , Wednesday . You make that jump or you catch a bullet . At least , this way , you stand a chance . ( thunder rumbling ) You 've been training for this your whole life . You can do it . ( woman ) Move ! Move ! You can make that jump . ( thunder rumbling ) ( grunting ) ( gasps ) ( Thursday sobbing ) ( Joe ) Get her to the processing center . - They 'll know what to do . - ( zipping up bag ) I 'll call it in . ( sighs ) What do you want to drink ? - A shot of vodka . - Oh . ( glass clinking ) ( cabinet door banging ) ( glass clinking ) ( liquid pouring ) ( computer beeping ) ( rapid beeping ) ( dings ) The file from Wednesday . It 's a 407-C funds transfer , just like Jerry said . Why would Karen Settman illegally transfer millions of euros into Nicolette Cayman 's campaign fund ? This contract was executed the same day as we got our promotion . A transfer that big ... Hm ... Karen Settman really needed that promotion . ( beeping ) That 's weird . There 's no signature . ( moans ) ( gasps ) ( moans ) ( moans ) ( dings ) ( mutters ) - ( rapid beeping ) - ( dings ) We 're in . ( gasps ) - She did it . - Yeah . ( breathing heavily ) Fuck me . ( moans ) ( clock chiming , ticking ) Wh-Where are the cells ? You know , where they keep people . Oh , uh ... - The processing center . - Can you get in there ? I think so . Hold on . - ( mutters ) - ( dings ) ( dings ) Stop . - Is this feed real time ? - Yeah . ( beeps , dings ) ( sighs ) ( sighs ) I-I think it 's Monday . ( man moans ) Oh , shit . I 'm late . - ( Saturday ) Don 't go . - ( moans ) ( sighs ) I gotta go . There 's this big event at the Bureau tonight . Cayman 's starting her push for Parliament . Why are you working for them ? The Bureau ? Why not ? Well , couldn 't you get another job ? Why would I want another job ? Don 't you think it 's wrong to be rounding up siblings ? Have you ever set foot in the lower sectors ? I mean , most of these kids that we pick up , they live in really shitty conditions . ( chuckles ) Trust me , we 're doing them a favor . By sending them off to the cryobank ? Yeah . For now . Until we see better days . See you later ? I have some ... work stuff to catch up on . - Let 's meet on our usual day . - We talked about this , right ? I just wanna be with you every day . Not just Monday . See you , babe . ( door opens ) ( door closes ) ( indistinct chatter ) So , Monday 's been seeing Adrian for months . Miss Perfect likes to be choked during sex . Can you believe it ? Cayman is holding her hostage . What ? Monday 's alive ? Yeah . Be careful , Saturday . This Bureau agent could be playing us . I ... I don 't know . I don 't think so . I 'm scared , Thursday . - What are we gonna do ? - We 're gonna get through this . Every day we set foot outside , we beat the odds . We 're gonna get Monday out , and we 're gonna show the world who Cayman really is . ( door opens , closes ) ( suspenseful music playing ) ( weapon beeping ) ( weapon whirring ) I love ... ( glass shattering ) ( dings ) - We gotta go ! - No ! It 's everything . - Our whole life is in here . - There 's no time . This is the only proof we ever existed . Come on . Forget it . We gotta go . Okay ? Okay . ( coughing ) Here , put it over your face . ( glass shattering ) Come on ! - Come on ! - ( coughing ) Come on , Friday . Friday , what are you doing ? Friday ! Friday , what the fuck ? Friday , get down here now ! Please ! Friday ! ( coughing ) ( inhales , coughs ) ( beeping ) ( gas hissing ) ( coughing ) ( sighs ) - ( beeping ) - ( suspenseful music playing ) ( beeping ) Friday , get down , please . I synched everything to your bracelet . What ? ( coughs ) Go and get Monday . Show Cayman who Karen Settman really is . What are you talking about ? Please , there 's still time ! It 's okay . I 'm not like the rest of you . As crazy and dysfunctional as our family was , I needed it to survive . I couldn 't make it out there . Not without you guys . Friday , get down here now ! Please ! ( beeps ) Friday ! It 's time to unplug , big sis . - ( buzzing , crackling ) - ( beeps ) ( whirring ) I love you . ( dings ) ( people screaming ) ( groans ) ( inaudible ) ( sighs ) ( man over radio ) Zulu Victor One to Bravo Delta . Zulu Victor One to Bravo Delta . Reports of an explosion . 25 Alexander Plaza . Multiple causalities . I repeat , 25 Alexander Plaza . Multiple casualties . Please respond . ( sirens wailing in distance ) ( breathes deeply ) Move ! Move ! - ( man speaking indistinctly ) - Another one coming your way . - ( man ) Authorization ? - Full clearance . - You know the drill . - Yes , sir . Karen ? - Step back , please . - ( woman ) Get him out of here . Is it Karen ? Let me see her . Let me see her ! Let me see her ! Let me see her ! Karen ! Ka ... ( sirens wailing ) Don 't move ! Don 't move ! What the fuck ? You sold us out . ( breathing heavily ) You son of a bitch ! Karen ? K-Karen ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Stop your fucking games ! You know who I am . Jesus Christ , you 're a sibling . Yeah . One of seven . Identical in every way . Well ... not in every way . Karen ... I saw her in a body bag . - Not her . - She was in my apartment last night . - She was in my apartment . I saw her . - Not her . - She was in my apartment ! - It wasn 't her ! She 's not dead . She 's alive . ( grunts ) I love ... I have nothing to do with it . You have to trust me . I love Karen . Cayman is holding her hostage . If you love her ... if you really love her ... you gotta help me . You have a plan ? I am the plan . ( suspenseful music playing ) - ( beeps ) - ( dings ) - ( beeps ) - ( indistinct chatter ) Yeah , they 're expecting you downstairs . ( beeping ) ( doors hissing ) I 'll take it from here . ( doors hissing ) ( beeping ) Will it hurt ? No . ( groans ) - ( beeping ) - ( whirring ) ( beeping ) I thought there was a fire . ( grunting ) ( muffled yelling ) ( grunting ) Fuck . ( grunts , groans ) ( beeping ) No , no ! No ! No ! No ! No , no ! No ! Help me ! Let me out ! Help me ! Please let me out ! ( woman screaming ) ( screaming ) ( groans ) - Are you okay ? - Yeah . It was all a lie . Cayman killed them all . Every sibling . ( beeping ) Okay . - ( whimpering ) - ( Adrian ) Hey . Karen . Tuesday . - No , please ! Please , no , please ! - It 's me . It 's me . - Please , no , please ! - It 's not her . - ( crying ) - Shh ... It 's okay . Shh ... - ( crying ) - Shh ... - We 're gonna get you out . Okay ? - ( door closes ) Where 's Karen ? Is she still alive ? Where 's Karen ? What happened to Monday ? Ah ... Karen . How are you enjoying your stay ? I trust we 've made you comfortable . More than comfortable . We failed miserably as a species on this planet . Masterminding our own extinction . But , through it all , through your donation and my push for Parliament , we might just still have another chance . Take your wig off . Take it off ! ( plastic rustling ) If you 're beginning to have second thoughts , you should know that I 've kept one of your siblings alive as collateral . And , after all ... anyone who 's willing to sacrifice their own flesh and blood ... can never be fully trusted . ( dings ) So ... how does it feel to be the one and only Karen Settman ? When you get into the main server , use the code Friday wrote . Cayman 's speech starts in 15 minutes . - Let 's go . - Let 's take this bitch down . ( applause ) Fuck . ( Tuesday ) Nobody moves ! Show me your hands ! Open the door ! - Open the fucking now or I 'll shoot him ! - ( Adrian ) Do it ! Do it . ( beeps ) ( beeps ) - ( screams ) - ( grunts ) ( applause continues ) ( suspenseful music playing ) ( beeping ) ( breathing deeply ) ( water running ) - ( door closes ) - ( breathes deeply ) Monday . I 'm impressed . You 've never worn Karen Settman so well . - You think you own her . You don 't . - I do her justice . You only pretend . ( beeps ) ( beeping ) Thank you for coming this evening . I 'm deeply honored and grateful . ( applause ) I gotta get to Cayman . Get her away from the servers . ( grunts ) - ( grunts ) - ( glass shattering ) You sold us out . How could you ? I thought you , of all people , would understand . Understand ? We were your family . What do you know about family ? All these years of endless lectures on responsibility and sacrifice ? I never saw you do any of it , not once . I did everything I was told . Everything right . I did everything I could to protect our family . ( scoffs ) You have a funny way of showing it . Sunday died in my arms . Wednesday fell to her death . Saturday was shot in the head , and Friday ... ( sighs ) I didn 't plan this . I met Adrian and I fell in love . And things changed . I made a deal with Cayman , and ... ( stammers ) it got out of my control . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry you ... you lost your finger because of me . I was a ... I was a total fuck-up . If I could go back and change it all , I would . Karen Settman ... was so much more than any one of us . She was all of us . She was our family . - ( scoffs ) - ( gun cocks ) I was the firstborn . Karen Settman was always mine . The rest of you ? You were just afterbirth . For three decades , the Child Allocation Bureau has combatted the most serious crisis our world has ever faced . Catastrophic overpopulation . Critics may chastise our methods , but the numbers don 't lie . ( applause ) ( rapid beeping ) ( grunting ) In a perfect world , every child has the right to live . That 's why I 'm running for office . So I can reform the law . ( groans ) Anyone who wants to bring a child into this world must be able to prove financial stability ... and be able to guarantee the emotional and physical well-being of that child . ( weapon beeping , whirring ) ( grunting ) There may even be room for siblings ... if the data measures up . ( neck cracks ) ( grunts ) So I commend you for your vision as we continue to take positive action to build a sustainable future full of hope and possibility . ( weapon fires ) ( both grunting ) ( groaning ) Together ... we will ... ( screams ) survive . ( gun fires ) - ( suspenseful music playing ) - ( applause ) Are you okay ? ( whistling ) Hit it . ( beeping ) ( cryosleep pod hissing ) ( cryosleep pod clicking ) ( beeping ) ( cryosleep pod whirring ) They didn 't suffer . No , they didn 't suffer . They didn 't suffer . They didn 't suffer ! ( Cayman sobbing ) ( grunting ) What have you done ? What have you done ? ( grunting ) ( people screaming ) ( people screaming ) ( groans , wheezes ) ( Terrence ) Monday . I need you to be brave . Set an example for your sisters . ( screaming ) ( Terrence sobbing ) ( sobbing continues ) I 'm just trying to protect you . I 'm so sorry . ( cries ) ( crying ) Promise me ... Don 't let them take them . Don 't let them take them . Hey , baby . Hey , baby . Stay with me , okay ? Oh ... Baby , you 're okay . Baby . Baby . Federation-wide rioting has forced the repeal of the Child Allocation Act . Hundreds of siblings held in processing centers have been released . Pregnant women are coming out of hiding in droves , the majority from poorest districts . Without this repeal , many of these children would have been discarded or processed the minute they were born . - ( crowd clamoring ) - ( camera shutters clicking ) This planet is the only home you will ever know . So , look around . Ask yourselves . Who will continue to make the difficult decisions that will ensure your survival ? My regret ... My regret is that your children will never know the world we could have built together . That hope is gone forever . I like your new eye , Tuesday . - They did a good job . - Thank you . Oh , it 's not Tuesday anymore . It 's Terry . ( chuckles ) Okay . Terry . So ... what should I call you ? Karen . Karen Settman . ( chuckles ) ( Terry ) Monday did it all for them . She wanted them to be safe . Well ... they will be . ( babies crying ) ( crying grows louder ) ^ . ^ . ^ . ^ .subtitles by . ^ . ^ . ^ . ^ ® Sud _ Arun collections ®

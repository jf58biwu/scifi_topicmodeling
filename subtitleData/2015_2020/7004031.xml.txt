 Deep voice : Computer , where am I ? Computer : You have arrived six days into the future . Deep voice : And what am I looking at ? Computer : Destruction of a battle . Deep voice : Show me . Maze : There is so much to see when you have no sight . It 's not like closing your eyes and feeling around your house . It 's a whole new world . Same as vengeance . When something like vengeance takes over your soul . You become things you never thought you 'd become . Never believed you 'd become . Murderer . Monster . Martyr . But you ... See , you 're in a situation all too unfamiliar . You see , it 's not just one ... but two . Fade : Know where these scars came from ? It wasn 't from the well-known red rain . It was from ... People like you . People who stood in the way of progress . Progress ... my progress . This is my reminder . Death was theirs . Although , generosity is not in our nature , I 'll give you this . I won 't kill you to get to her . But ... we will fulfill our job description and remove you from this city . He will kill you . Do you realize how much blood is on these hands ? What 's a few more stains ? Deep voice : Computer , who is this ? Look how busy they all are , one moment to the next . Their lives become more dull as they wither into nothing . But now I inject a little chaos and look what happens . Their lives now mean something . They have a purpose . A reason for their existence . Little do I care about these diatribes of human existence . Where is my sister ? In time . Your entire task isn 't finished . There are still more hiding out there undercover , remaining hidden from the eye . Find them and take care of the problem . So , where did they come from ? This one ? Fade : Yes , what was his power ? He had this ... shadow he could ... conjure . Shadow .. Deep voice : Freeze . What innocent is he talking about ? Someone 's a bit sore , eh ? Is that all you 've got ? Who sent you ? Now , you know I can 't tell you that . Who sent you ? ! One of yours ? What the hell ? I found this huge chunk of metal . Look at this thing . This could be dangerous . Yeah , I know . There we go . It fits ! That is awesome ! Nice ! Yes ! Alright , let 's go find some more . You guys just made a huge mistake . - Recycling is never a mistake . - Do you have anything else ? For the orphans . Wanna see bad ? Deep voice : Who was that man ? Markus . According to the police report , they put the female 's body ... Sherry . Right , Sherry 's body , right there in the bloody area . And , uh , the assailant must have been standing over there . Boy must have seen the assailant and chased him out the door . What do you want now ? Come on , Sherry . Cain 'll never know . Sherry : Look , I don 't know what kind of tricks you 're trying to pull here . But it 's not gonna work . Why can 't you just understand that ? Markus : I know what you are trying to do , Sherry , and it 's not nice . Look , Markus . Nothing will ever happen . I want you to leave now . You 're nothing but a lap dog . You 're my ex-husband 's footstool . You try everything you can to try and get out from his shadows , but you never will . You 're pathetic . Deep voice : Computer , go back to the battle . Damn . What I miss ? Sup . Deep voice : Now , who is this ? I have a lead on the two heroes from the crime scene . Apparently , they have been posting videos online to recruit others . I don 't give a damn . It 's not worth fighting him . You think I fear death ? There are far worse things than death . Tell him to bring it on . Look at you , all fueled with rage . Do you find something amusing about your own death ? You 're quite mistaken about that . Look at you . So much power hides in those veins . You are a cascading vortex of pure hatred , and now ... a puppet for my amusement . How 's it finally feel being the weaker of the two ? Feast your eyes one last time . Allow my image to be burned into your mind 's eye . Burn your eyes out . He wants you to self-destruct . Play his little game , wait for the perfect moment ... and then get your vengeance . I 'll go . You ... dispose of this kid . Deep voice : The boy from earlier , how did he get there ? Willie . That was a good job . Alright , we got a few recyclables . Yes , and we took out a bad guy . Oh . Was he bad ? Let us get him some coal and put it in his stocking . We don 't have a stocking to give it in . He does not have a stocking ? - That 's not a problem . We can get one . - Alright ! Yes . Okay , um ... that way ! Let 's go ! Woohoo ! They just left by jumping up the side of the building . Thanks . Is it better to live a monster or die a hero ? In this question there 's only two choices . But are there only two ? I like to believe there 's a third in between . To exist . Not good , not bad . Not martyr , not sinner . To just live . Be normal . I choose normality . I choose to step from the polar ends and meet in the middle . But I can 't choose that . So , I choose death . Can 't have that either , thanks to this curse . So ... I Grant you mercy , by removing you from a world worth leaving . Enjoy it . Deep voice : Return to the fight . Feeling around your house . It 's a whole new world . Same as vengeance . When something like vengeance ... Deep voice : Who might this be ? I won 't kill you , to get to her . Deep voice : What is so special about her ? Is he in there ? Is this the place ? Christy : Yes , that 's the Ir room . Instant rehabilitation . We need to talk . Is this some kind of casual encounter ? Don 't flatter yourself . I 'm here to get back what you 've stolen . Where 's the hard drive , Max ? Odd , you know my name , but I don 't seem to know yours . I , uh ... I saw a hero today . A little boy , no more than five years old . He uh , stood up for another boy at the bus stop . It was ... It was ... one step closer . The air is different here . I don 't know if it 's peace or Serenity of death . You 're out of the darkness now . It 's only in their eyes . People don 't love each other anymore ... They just fight . I love you , Alan . I love you . Can I help you ? I came to pay my respects . Jerry : Oh , I 'm sorry . Did you know him well ? Not long . Actually I didn 't help him at all . I was somebody else . It was another life . Jerry : I see . I 'm Jerry , his brother . Christy . Your brother ... he had a gift . Do you ? I 'm sorry , I don 't mean to be nosey . I know it 's personal . It 's fine . Yeah ... I do . Do you think you can help me ? You didn 't come for Alan ... Did you ? - I need help . - What 's wrong ? I was an accessory to stealing a hard drive containing detailed information about people 's lives in the city . - What do you need me for ? - That 's just it . The person who knows got incarcerated . I 'm not gonna be breaking someone out of prison . No , it 's not like that . We break in , yes , we get the information ... then we leave . Where is he ? Nor will you . Now where 's the hard drive ? Wearing your big boy pants today . What puts you in control ? My purpose puts me in control . And all the people in this city that you spit on , I 'm here to protect them . Spit . Well , hero of this city , come take a ride with me . Is this all you can do ? Is this all you got ? Come on , make it hurt ! Deep voice : Tell me about this man . Jason X : It wasn 't long after the meteor hit that I had my first encounter with death . The red rain phenomena came a mutation , started to infect people . Most were immune to it , but those with increased exposure were given a curse . With that curse came the main catalyst to the wars . Some called it the future of mankind . The rest called it an abomination . They lost their lives . Stupid ! The infected started to drastically decline in numbers until one day , all the rest just went into hiding . Years went by a series of reform and rebuild . Everything became structured again . Except now , we have a hotline to call in case someone uses powers . I know you 're there . I didn 't mean to alarm you . What are you doing ? Skye : I ... we need your help . - Aw , come on ! - No , seriously . Okay , yeah , we did try to attack you back there , but that 's because we thought you were one of them . Jason X : Okay , who are you and who 's them ? I 'm Skye and I 'm with a rebel group called entropy . It 's a group that ... yeah , yeah . I watch the news . It 's not who we are . We 're trying to make a difference . By killing innocent people ? That 's how you 're making a difference ? And what were you trying to do earlier ? Echoing voice : I can Grant you a gift , and I can 't take it away . It 's simple . Would you like all your greatest desires ... to come true ? Take a life . It will all be given to you . What are you looking for ? Do you see something you like ? Anyway , that 's not us . That 's someone else doing those attacks . We 're a non-violent group . We 're trying to un-brainwash people and bring them out of the darkness . So , who did you think I was ? Well , one of the shadows . They 're everywhere but you can never see them . Well , you made a mistake . I can 't help you . Skye : Yes , you can . We are only five strong ! No , what you need to do is stop playing Batman and go home ! People die . This is not a comic book . There are no happy endings . You live , there 's a lot of misery , and then you die . Once you understand that , you 'll know it 's not worth it . We don 't all have to be miserable . If you can save one person from a miserable life , isn 't that worth ours ? Spoken like a true hero . And what else might I have done ? I only hid my actions under the law of the city . Deep voice : When does this girl come in ? I won 't kill you to get to her . Lauren : Dear dad , I know you always wanted a certain degree of success from me . And you 've gotten it , until you read this note . I can 't live anymore in your shadow . I know you started out nothing and built so much . I 'm not you . I can 't be hidden from the world any longer . I need to see this world for myself . I need to experience failure , heartbreak , and love . All these emotions that you have steered me clear of . I know you love me . I love you too . But I just need this time to figure out who I am . And who I want to be in this world . I love you , dad . Lauren . Egotan : Egotan ! Cybersting : And Cybersting 's ... Egotan : Mini book ! Cybersting : Of justices . Egotan : Justice ... Cybersting : No . Egotan : Justice ! Cybersting : Lauren found herself caught up with the wrong people and in the wrong place . Egotan : I am so caught up . Cybersting : Lauren had nothing to call out for , neither hope nor prayer . She was lost . Egotan : Oh , I am so lost ! Cybersting : Sticky and twitch are the two that are ... Have Lauren captive . This is sticky . Egotan : I 'm sticky , I 'm bad . Cybersting : This is twitch . Because of their unclean hotel room they had a visit they will never forget . Egotan : Oh , it 's so unclean . Oh , that 's me . Cybersting : Egotan and cybersting were out collecting garbage for recycling purposes . Egotan : I 'm collecting . Cybersting : The hostility grew as they refused to recycle . That ended up being a big mistake . Egotan : Horn of justice . Cybersting : Cybersting came in , happy to see that he needs to teach the importance of recycling . Egotan : Lesson one . Cybersting : With both crooks taken down , the two decide to start their recycling endeavor . Egotan : There 's so much trash . Cybersting : In the bathroom , cybersting finds a weak , beaten-down girl and he decides to help . Egotan : Oh , she 's so beat . Cybersting : Cybersting is not happy . Egotan : Look at his angry face ! So not happy . Deep voice : What is it about these two ? Egotan : Our ride will be around here somewhere . Oh , over here . It is far too dangerous for you , beaver , so you stay back . Cybersting : There is a massive puddle . Egotan : And you are right . Away ! Benever Beaver : These are my streets . I walk as a shadow . Surveying the land for any evil that might stir . I am the uncle chef fist of justice . The unbridled bond between circumstance and reason . I am here , I am now . I am benever beaver . Deep voice : Benever beaver . Is this a joke ? Enough . Continue with the fight . And this one ? Cain : There-there are people in this world ... you can 't trust . People who stand beside you for years ... and then turn their backs . Et Tu , brute ? Don 't worry about looking for anyone . That 's not your job . It was mine that was taken , and I shall handle this . You ... you just watch things for me ... while I 'm gone . And make sure they go smoothly . I ... I have a few heads to collect . Fade : Looks like it 's the senator 's daughter . Senator : You got three minutes , starting one minute ago . Make it quick . Fade : Your daughter was murdered yesterday . Oh ... Just oh ? What do you want me to say ? That I feel bad ? That it shouldn 't have happened to her ? That she was a good person ? No . I warned her that if she hung around with criminals , she 'd either die or end up a criminal herself . Our lack of caring about your daughter dying is a bit of a red flag for me . Maybe you pulled the trigger , you heartless son of a bitch . Excuse me . I might be a heartless son of a bitch , but I 'm not the murdering kind . I get someone else to do it for me . Do you know of anyone she may have hung out with that might be considered criminals in your vocabulary ? Yeah , those little pricks that hang out down at the water hole . Water hole ? Yeah , where those people go to drown themselves . Don 't you read the newspapers ? Deep voice : Computer , get to the point . So , what 'd he say ? Nothing of importance . He said he was busy . Busy ? Damnit ! Max ! What the hell is all this ? A map ! Hello ? Bitch blew my arm off ! We must unlock her . What the hell are we doing here ? Deep voice : Must tap into a hard drive . So , a regular hard drive ? Seriously ? I know who would know . I think it would depend on if they were encrypted or the files were just hidden , maybe minutes . What if it 's in someone 's brain ? What ? You mean like hacking the mind ? Didn 't take long for you to return . What , five years ? Uh , again it would depend on how it was put in there . What might entertain you this day ? What says I didn 't come to chat ? Well , we don 't know how , but is it possible ? Zeek : I 'm building myself a robotic arm , so , yes . Yes , it 's possible . Or get all lathered up in conversation ... with an old friend . Right there , that 's why ... we 've never been friends . So , how is the old watering hole , lately ? Not very many suicides here . Not a one . Who 's here with you ? A traitor and a little girl . You decide who 's who . We 've come to find the hard drive . The girl ... and the traitor . We were led to believe you knew where to find the hard drive . You were led ... right . But I can only tell one person at a time where this hard drive is . Then two of us ... will leave . That won 't be working either . You see , as of right now ... there are more than just the four of us here . They came before you . What the hell just happened ? So , Ress told me some of the details , but please tell me about this hard drive . And who do you wish to kill ... With it ? Who are you ? What am-what am I doing here ? - We brought you tea . - Damsels always drink tea . Always . Tea ? So , what information does this device hold ? It started to retrieve information about the world . Like what ? Life ... Any and all information in the future . So , this knows passwords , people , locations . Everything . So , where is it ? Here , I made this for you . When I was making fliers so we could apprehend our last criminal . Egotan : Don 't worry ! See , our last fliers got evil toxin caught and off the streets . - Whoa , are you not impressed ? - Mmh . So , you don 't catch crooks ? Don 't litter . Don 't pull the tags off the mattresses ! The list is endless . Cybersting : Endless . She 's ... an implant . A tracking ... device . Lauren : Do you have sugar ? Egotan : Alright . I think we have come to the conclusion that there is no sugar in this room ! Lauren : Seriously , don 't ! Stop pulling this . Ah ha ! Crime smells a foot . We must find a perch for crime . Cybersting : Crime smells . Egotan : Yes , it ... oh wait ! Cookies ! Where could they be ? Cybersting : Oh , I found a bench ! Egotan : Ah ha , you are right ! It is absolutely perfect ! They ditched me again . I 'm a super hero , too . I got powers . I need my own horn of justice . - Hmm . - Hmm . - Hmm . - Mm-hmm . Hmm . Egotan : Oh , we point . Cybersting : Of course ! What about over there ? Zeek : Now , something with that amount of power is going to be setting off a pretty steady set of electromagnetic frequencies . Egotan : These are good benever beaver cookies . Here , take some . Cybersting : Thank you . Perfect . See through these you should be able to spot it from a mile away . Might be blinding actually . If you 're looking for a needle in a haystack , those right there are your magnet . Jason X : I 'm going alone . Whoa , there are a lot of people out there looking for her . Jason X : I 'm going alone . It 's too dangerous to go alone . Hey , you two , seriously , why do I have to wear this ? Egotan : Hmm . That is a safety harness . Cybersting : It is to make sure you are never stolen for evil again . Want a cookie ? Egotan : Cybersting needs a cape . Down the road . Cybersting , you need a cape . Cybersting : I need no cape . Egotan : Yes , you do . That 's what we are missing . Deep voice : So , the tank found her . He must know he could use her to find who killed his family . Cybersting : I have pants . Egotan : I see those pants . Cybersting : You have pants . Egotan : I have pants ! No way ! The trembling in my pants ! - Pants ! Pants ! - Pants ! - Pants ! Pants ! - Pants ! Pants ! - Pants ! Pants ! - Pants ! Pants ! Well ? - Pants ? Pants ! - Pants ! - I 've got pants . - I 've got pants . Pants ! I 'm a peacock ! Oh , where did everybody go ? Cain : The safest you 'll ever be is right by my side . Cybersting : You left her tea . Whoa . Freaky . There 's a little girl out there ... running for her life ... and we want to chase her down for our own selfishness . Metus killed my sister ... but his power ... Deep voice : Interesting . Max , the only one not in the fight threw her out the window ... and then saved by these two . Maze : His powers are not derived from him . It 's from us . We have to take that control away . Zeek : No , you cannot just keep piling people into my house . Cybersting : It will be fine egotan : Go quickly over here . Hide over there . Zeek : Nope no , no hiding . Egotan : Like this . I 've had enough of this world . I deserve this . Deep voice : They bring the girl away where they are attacked once again . Deep voice : And maze grows a weakness ... a heart ... taking their lives . So where 's the rodent ? Oh , why ? Gah ! I don 't know . It just feels right . Why are there so many lights ? It just adds to the mood . Kill him . Christy , you never said anything about killing anyone . What do you think would happen if someone other than us got their hands on what 's inside of her ? I understand , but it 's ending lives , not saving them . Says who ? Continue . This is fun . What do you see happening ? After all this ? I don 't know . Don 't do it . I-I cant . Yes , you can . What an odd twist . Oh ... lets see ... You have a gun and I have ... nothing . So , lets see . You want another body . Is that it ? I 'm not afraid . Do it . She always likes making a presence . Max . Crypt . It 's been a while . You 're quite late on your dues . When can I start seeing some payment ? Well I ... Well I ... brought you one right here . Jerry : Sometimes ... I have this dream ... where I 'm in the dark ... alone ... dying ... I keep telling myself ... that this is only a dream ... What if it 's not ? Since then ... I 've always been afraid of the dark . Lauren : Stop it ! Where are we going ? Shut up and follow me . You think you 're the only one ? I missed lunch ... and nap time ... and second lunch . Lauren : Every time I go with you I see people being impaled . I think I have it a little bit worse . Please . Lets go . Deep voice : Four dead , two cowards ran off , the idiots must be dead , and a few ... remain . Watch out for the rubble . I just got it the way I like it . Lauren : This place is a disaster . It 's disgusting . Cain : Is it ... darkness ... that drives you ? They tried to kill you ... but you continue to walk ... stand ... fight ... Max : Crawl ... and hide ... I 'm sorry . I 'm not good at poetry . Cain : What is this ? I 'm here to help you . Right here . Hmm .. Not so fast . Well Roy , it 's that damn beaver again . Benever . Oh , not him again . We keep telling you not to come around these parts . You 're able to be shot . Benever beaver : Yeah , uh , this is our secret hide out . I 'm going into that cave . Your going to get a super secret bullet up your ass . I 'm sorry , guys . I 'm sorry for whatever benever might have done . We just really need somewhere to stay . These people are after us . I 'm ... I just need somewhere to stay for the night . I 'm sorry . There 's nothing down there . So might you two walk away . Put some haste in your feet before Roy and I bet who can take the most bullets to the head before they hit the ground . Benever beaver : I 'm not going nowhere . Lauren : No , no ! Look at what you did . I don 't think they liked you . And the plot thickens . Benever beaver : This guy again . Please don 't hurt him . He 's already drawn his sword and cast the first blow . I 'm sorry . What ? I wasn 't listening . Just to warn you , my blood will stain . Cybersting : Oh , we found some recyclables down by the mill . Egotan : Fee fi fo fum ! You came lead her to tea again ? Do you even know why anyone is after her ? Egotan : Well you see , she needed our help and that is all that is important . Ah , yes . Egotan : Cowabunga ! Uh-oh . I 'm not good . Egotan : My turn ! You missed me . Slap . Egotan : Egotan ! Chimichanga ! Lauren : Come on you big oaf , get up . I 'm fine . Lauren : Do it your damn self . I 'm fine . Come on . - Wait here . - No , I 'm coming with you . Ow ! Eat my cookies . This means nothing . Through the cave , that 's the way out the back . Deep voice : The rodent flees , and now , enter Max . Max : The plan was simple . Take a hard drive ... that was endowed with ... special powers ... of absorbing ... all the information ... of the Internet ... place this hard drive ... in a child ... deep , deep into the mind ... There , no one ... will be able to find it . The idea was sound ... easy ... For a time ... until long passed ... that child ... becomes lost ... lost to me ... but it 's found ... was found ... my hard drive ... All I had to do ... was retrieve it . Deep voice : The city , how did it get destroyed ? A dying wish granted to the already deceased . Her sacrifice is just the catalyst . And you justify death with her death ? I justify life with her death . I justify the well being of everyone in this city ... with her sacrifice you are a tyrant with a whistle around every person 's neck ready to cry wolf at the slightest beat . How goes the witch hunt ? There is only one witch I wish to burn . I am the cause of your current rule . I will take your animosity and ... offer you a way out of this ... cat and mouse game you 're playing . Would you like to hold the knowledge ... of all of the city in the palm of your hand ? What would it cost , witch ? Very little . There is a hard drive ... in a young girl . Retrieve her , and I 'll Grant you access to all of the information . Where is she ? Deep voice : Explains why he made his two minions follow up on the hanged girl . I did as you asked ... but Cain hasn 't done what you said he would . Now he 's on this little rampage of vengeance . This did not go as you said it would . Crypt : Fear not what happened . But fear what will be . Markus : Tell me where she is ... and I 'll get it for you . Crypt : In a cave northwest of here , on the outskirts of town . And I thought she was taking care of the two of you . Depends on who you 're referring to . I was sent ... By me ... Witch ! What ... what is going on here ? We had a deal . I fulfilled my deal . You did not . This cave ... and these two ... protect the last remnants of the red rain ... for me . Then what the hell did you need me for ? To distract ... unleash chaos in the city ... and a victim . It has been far too difficult to get one more body down here . Markus : You think ... Oops . Deep voice : So the witch manipulated all sides . When did she destroy the city ? Your course has run its end . You 're through . Your reign will end ... tonight ! Deep voice : And how are the two favoring ? Egotan : So , I think we should end this . It 's time to get serious . Cybersting : Yes , there are many that need help in the city . Egotan : Oh , you are right ! Egotan : Can you see me ? Cybersting : Don 't litter . Bitch . Deep voice : The power of the device in her head .. Brings out the witch . Stop . Don 't harm him . Your reign shall end . You will not get the power you desire . Crypt : We 'll see about this . Egotan : Where did everything go ? Cybersting : Huh ? Enough ! Egotan : Egotan . Cybersting : Cybersting ! Egotan : Oh , okay , lets see . Oh , alright . Lets ... I guess we 'll just turn , right here . And , right , okay . That looks perfect . Deep voice : So , these two are my adversaries . Egotan : Ah ! Oh ! Ow ! I hit my hand . - Egotan ! - Cybersting ! Deep voice : When did they die ? Computer : You killed them ... Four days ago .

 Don 't . Orange . Bat ... Andalusia Leader to all units . Target the transport only . do not engage . We will use Kaufmann 6 as an anchor to perform wire swingby and return to Trident Base . people . Roger that . Target located . commence attack . Wind 's too strong ... Our rounds are drifting ! Stay calm ! They 're in the same boat ! Hit ' em before they can get close ! Multiple high-density satellites ! We can 't hit them at this range ! Don 't hold back on the bullets ! Keep firing ! I 'm hit ! Damage minor ! Continuing missi   – . Andalusia 33 ! Andalusia 22 ! That 's not possible ! How can he land any shots in this wind ? What in the world ? Intense thermal reading approaching ! An enemy ? sir ! That 's ... The Tharsis ! Please get clear . I 'll handle them . Sir Slaine Troyard ... Andalusia 11 ! Bastard ! so how can that be ? ! are upon me . Slaine Troyard has come . I idolized Earth . Its blue seas . Its blue skies . and is blessed with an abundance of life and natural resources . I once lost my life on that world of Earth . my eyes were opened to the truth . How outrageous it was for the Terrans to live among that bounty without appreciating it . and is devoted to the pursuit of pleasure . We mustn 't allow them to have their way with this precious world of Earth . praise and commend all those Orbital Knights who have died in the name of that noble cause . What 's the point of watching that pirate broadcast of theirs ? that 's all ... I wonder what happened to the princess ? Who knows ? I thought she was on Earth 's side . Who knows ? Maybe she lost hope in there ever being a peaceful resolution . it 's only natural that she would side with Mars . after all . Inko ... Inko ? it 's nothing . I was just thinking that this might be our last chance to relax . we board the ship tomorrow and lift off the day after that . You sure it 's not him you 're thinking about ? I-It 's not ! It 's not like that ! people ! Are you training or aren 't you ? ! sir ! We plan to be able to lift off the day after tomorrow . Troops whose arrival was delayed should be here by tomorrow . Are you referring to him ? I wonder what the top brass are thinking ? We 'll essentially be going into battle with our vitals exposed . it changes things . They 're telling us to put it to effective use . Hard to believe we 'll be fighting side by side again ... ma 'am . It 's a miracle he made it back alive . one would never guess we are in an uneven gravity field . Slaine . Count Saazbaum . Granting you the title of knight was a wise decision . How did the battle go ? I destroyed some four enemy units . Milord Slaine . Mr. Harklight . There 's no need for " milord " with me . Milord . I am your manservant . and ... I 'm a Terran . Milord . Milord Slaine . Enter . Pardon the interruption . Princess Lemrina . Count Saazbaum . How fares the world ? and their takeover is underway . UEF counterattacks continue due to the surrender of the Landing Castles there . Will I be able to go down to Earth ? We expect the UE to be exhausted soon . who inherit the bloodline will be installed as – . Do not say that ! Highness . Princess Lemrina . I have never been pleased with the blood flowing in my veins . I find it repugnant . Am I only being kept alive because of the value of my blood ? To merely be a tool that exists to awaken Aldnoah . My apologies . I understand . Count Saazbaum . I am grateful to you . Slaine . Highness . What is it ? Will you teach me of Earth again ? Gladly . huh ? Yeah ... I hope we make it back alive . Yeah ... We 're not going to die . We 'll beat the Martians . We 'll beat them and restore peace on Earth . Period . We don 't have time to die . I guess not . Surprise attack ! It 's a Martian Kataphrakt ! 20 klicks . Closing at 50kph . All hands to battle stations . We 're leaving the dock . But the antigravity device is being serviced ! Sorry I 'm late ! What on Earth are you wearing ? Where is the uniform you were supplied with ? Well ... it wasn 't very cute . Wasn 't – . so I 'll authorize it . Captain ! shall I tell you why you can 't get a date ? launch all operational units ! Any enemy intel ? Frozen Elysium . Its Aldnoah Drive 's unique capability is Entropy Dilution . Entro-what ? It saps the molecular motion of all matter inside a field 1km in radius . It creates super-low temperatures that can transform the air and freeze it . Terrans . Show me how you defy the power of Aldnoah ! it 'll reach the Deucalion 's dock in 15 minutes . We have to slow it down somehow ... Slow it down ? You must be joking . We 're going to destroy it . This is Harbinger Platoon . Target spotted . We 're going in in cold-weather mode . on . Commence attack . What 's that ? The de-icers aren 't working ? Impossible ! You are helpless before it . It is not for nothing that its name is Frozen Elysium . Voltage is falling ? The chemical reaction in my batteries has stopped ? My hand ! Harbinger Leader ! Bastard ! My rounds aren 't connecting ! Why ? ! A shield ? It shouldn 't have one ! We 're out of options ! This is bad . We have to think of a way to slow it down . I thought you said we were going to destroy it ! Call it a downward revision ! Measuring bullet trajectory . you two . I get it . The warheads entered a superconductive state and were deflected by the Meissner Effect . Let 's see how air burst mode works . the battery in the warhead froze and the processor locked up ? Where does the sapped heat go ? Is it shunting the molecular movement energy somewhere else in our dimension ? about 50 meters should do it . 1km ... 20 rounds should do it . Inaho ? ! Charging enemy . You 'll freeze ! I just need to reach him before then . Hey ! then ! midair burst mode . 50 meters . Fire . well done . Inaho ! I took more damage than expected . I wonder if Calm will be mad ... Inaho ! Inaho ? I have been assigned to your ship . Inaho . Inko . I 'm glad you 're looking well . You have changed . Quite a bit . You can make polite small talk now . That 's not really a compliment . Inko ... Inaho . It 's good to be back . Slaine . I have finished off the Terran soldier who has been a thorn in our side . I have finally made up my mind . and am sure to do in the future ... Count Saazbaum . Many Terran troops have already breached the castle . Let 's escape in the Tharsis . And take Princess Asseylum with us . Count . Will you die with your ambitions unrealized ? Or choose to live with Princess Asseylum ? please . Highness ! What ? No ! Inaho ! Inaho ! Yuki ! Inaho 's been ... Inaho 's ... Dr. Yagarai ! You have to do something ! Inaho ? ! Gunshot wound to the head . Bullet went through the temporal region via the left eye socket . Patient unconscious . Three cc 's of adrenaline administered as emergency treatment . This is bad ... right ? He needs immediate surgical treatment . of course . However ... We have tools and facilities in the underground shelter ! Capt. Magbaredge ! Order the Deucalion to lift off ! The Aldnoah Drive ... is offline . Warrant Officer Kaizuka ... Princess Asseylum ... Where is she ? do your best ! Blood ? Nao 's blood ... not his ... It 's blood splatter . Whose ? It 's ... The light of Aldnoah ... The activation factor ... ! Nao ... dead slow ! dead slow . We 've left the atmosphere . Now coasting on inertia . Trident Base . fire . Monitor all wavelengths . The Terrans who so foolishly squandered the goodwill of the Vers Empire are even now biding their time to attempt to steal our lands from us . The Vers Empire must exterminate them out of mercy . Inaho ? We shall take the blue Earth for Vers . which possesses air and water in such quantities that it diffracts light It 's wrong . From the hands of the barbaric Terrans . It 's Rayleigh scattering that makes the sky blue . Eddelrittuo . Milady ! Right away ! Count Saazbaum ? Excellent . You were the very image of Princess Asseylum . No one would ever suspect your true identity . This is the problem with you men . No one was speaking of true identities . Princess Lemrina . Your majestic words as well . Sir Slaine Troyard . I am more grateful for such concern than any compliments on my performance . I am extremely and humbly delighted . I will take my leave now . Mr. Harklight . Princess Asseylum . I see that you are in good spirits again today .

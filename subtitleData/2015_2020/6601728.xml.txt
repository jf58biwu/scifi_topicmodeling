 - Mom ? - Go get your stuff . - What happened ? - We 've got to go . - But ... what happened ? - Now , Chris . - The Guard is pulling out . - Yeah , we saw them on the street . - They were looting . - They 're leaving , we 're leaving . I thought this was getting better . I thought we were winning . They 're retreating . It 's not safe for us to stay . Each for our own now . Going back to our original plan . We 're driving east . - Come on . - We 've got enough food and water to last us . What about Mom ? We 're gonna get her and Nick . Let 's go . - How , Dad ? - What ? How do we get them ? I found the place he spoke of with the dead inside . It 's close to their base . We can use it . I think he has given us all he can . - No , we still need him . - He can escape . - He can warn the others . - The soldiers are leaving . The soldiers are still there . They have guards . - Hey , I said no . - The compound . You know where the compound ... You don 't know ... you know where the compound is , but you don 't know where to go once you 're there . Which building , what floor , what hall . You don 't know where your family is inside . Okay ? The place is like a goddamn maze and I can draw you a map , all right ? You won 't get in without me . We 're bringing him . He can ride in the truck with you . Why ? Ashamed of something ? You afraid the kids will see ? If Chris was in danger , you 'd do anything you could to protect him , wouldn 't you ? Ofelia . We 're going to go find your mother , take her with us . I need your help . What about Andy ? We 'll bring him . You lied to me my whole life . I protected you your whole life . Does Mama know ? I thought you were the victim . Would you rather that be true ? Ofelia . Alicia , get in the car . - What ? - My neighbors don 't know . They did nothing when they came for us . 20 patients left ... 12 critical , the rest stable , all infection-free . One Chinook could lift the entire ward and personnel plus two dozen more soldiers , over . Transport inbound , over . What 's the ETA , over ? 0215 , over . Copy that . Over and out . Everybody , Edwards Air Force Base has room . Let 's lock it down . Crit cases are gonna be flying . We 're going mobile . What about my son ? I submitted the request . I 'll follow up . And the rest of my family ? Who are we counting as family ? We talking blood or bond ? A son needs his father . True , but the father will want his girlfriend . The girlfriend will want her children . What is family now ? Be brutal . I was brutal and you promised me Christopher . Yes . Just him ? And his father Travis . You might as well kill me now . The old man is gonna do it later . No , he won 't . You think that 's what he did in El Salvador ? Torture and release ? Get in the truck . You can 't stop him . Your own wife let him do it . - She let it happen . - You took her son . No , I didn 't . I didn 't do shit . I was kind . I was kind to his daughter . He cuts me . He mutilates me . Just get us where we need to go . I 'll tell you where you need to go . I will help you find your family . Just cut me loose , please . - I can 't do that . Just get in ... - Why ? Why ? - Get in the goddamn truck . - You 're not like them . I can see that you 're not like them . Get in the truck or I 'm gonna put you in the truck . The only reason to keep me now is to kill me and you know it . Please ... there 's no story here that doesn 't end with me dead . Jesus , they just left . They abandoned us . So they 're saying Edwards . - Who 's saying Edwards ? - Superiors . There 's no superiors left , man . There 's no one . The hell is this ? Is he turned ? The dead don 't use tools , man . Could be infected . Nice night . Sir , you 're entering a restricted area . Stay where you are . I don 't want to have to shoot you , old man . You should save your ammunition . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Holy shit ! Multiple infected northwest corner . I led them to the north gate , so all the soldiers are distracted . We can go now . We should move . What did you do ? He told me where to find them . - He told you ? - Yeah . I believed him , okay ? - Like you believed him . - It was the right thing to do . You 'll see what doing the right thing gets you . Chris . If things go sideways , if you see anything , you drive . Take the SUV and you drive to the campground . If we 're more than 30 minutes , drive . Dad , don 't leave me here . I can help . - I want to . Let me . - We 'll find you , I promise . I don 't drive yet . Alicia can drive if it comes to that . Chris , you 're gonna be okay . Take care of her , okay ? Let 's go . You take care of him . Don 't draw unnecessary attention . I am losing my mind . I thought the house was bad . Picture you 're somewhere else with a needle in your arm . Where 's your house ? Close . El Sereno . Oldest community in Los Angeles . Predates the city . Vibrant , blue-collar , diverse . I 'd gentrify the shit out of El Sereno . Another time , another world . What 's that ? What 's going on ? Full auto , close . - It 's time to go . - So where are we going ? What 's wrong ? Son of a bitch . What ? The compound 's compromised . And now evac knows it . Over here ! Call backup ! Hurry up ! Oh , my God . Hold the perimeter ! We need more men ! The hard part is done . If the infected get in , how do we get out ? That would be the harder part . What is the delay , over ? Stand by , Doctor . Stand by , over . The compound is secure . We 're ready to go . Doctor , we have reports of infected around your perimeter , over . They 're outside . The compound is secure . If you come now , there 's time to extract us , over . We are assessing , over . Dr. Exner . Go . Everyone go . The transports are downstairs . - Aren 't they coming ? - No . What about our patients ? I 'll take care of them . Just go . What about Chris ? If they haven 't gone for him by now , they never will . I 'm sorry . Go , Liza . Run . Stand by , Doctor , over . This is crazy . They 'll come back . If they can 't get in , they 'll come back . And leave the others ? Would you rather they all died ? I don 't want anyone to die . I don 't want that . You sound like your dad . Yeah , well , he tries . You can 't save everyone . - Why the hell would you say that ? - Because you can 't . Sorry , it 's just ... it 's the truth . - Shut up . - What ? Get in the car . Get in the car . Come along . Come along . Let us out of here ! The key is not one size fits all . We 'll die in here ! My friend , you 're more likely to die out there . Hey , you 're not gonna help them ? - We 're not gonna help them . - Why ? Because helping them could hurt us . - Don 't leave us here . - There 's no value add . Seriously ? Save yourself , Nick . Let others drop behind . Seriously . - So where are we going ? - We need a ride . - And then ? - Abigail . Who the hell 's Abigail ? If they 're dead , they 'll just keep walking , right ? - They 'll walk away ? - I don 't know . - Hey ! Hey ! - Come on . - Shut your ... come on . - Hey ! - Get off me ! - Get out . Come on . Get off me . Why didn 't you guys just open the damn door , huh ? What do you guys want ? Transport . Son , just give us the keys . No . Come on , man , we 'll take you with us . We 're not going anywhere . Suit yourself . - What about you , girl ? - Hey , you leave her alone . Leave her ... Stop it ! Stop it ! I have the keys . - You sure you don 't want to come ... - Hey , don 't touch her , man ! Get off me ! This must be the checkpoint . Adams said there 'd be a sign marked administration . It 's here . - We gotta load it . - Just get it on , boy . We can 't hold ' em ! The gate isn 't gonna hold ! There 's too many of them . I 'm out of here . They 're breaking through . Let 's go . I got you . Give me your hand , ma 'am . - Come on , it 's now or never . - No . Come on , we 're going ! - Oh , God . - Nah , he 's infected . Just leave him . Let 's go , let 's go ! Colonel ! Ah , no ! - Run ! - No , no ! No ! - Come back ! - No ! Run ! Which way ? Shit . Wait here . Are you crazy , man ? What are you doing ? It 's all right . They 're slow . All right , Melvin . Help me . Please . Strand . Stran ... Strand . Str ... Keep the watch . Please , kill me . You 're well on your way . Strand . How do we get out of here now ? Fantastic question . Melvin was my ride . Jesus . Nick . - Nick ! - Griselda ! - Mama ! - Help us ! - Mama ! - Nick Clark . - Mama ! - Nick ! - Help us , please . - Griselda ! - Mama ! - Who are you looking for ? I 'm looking for my son . He 's 19 . - There was a boy with the suit . - Who ? Rich guy stuck in here with us . - Where 'd they go ? - We 'll tell you . Let us out . Yeah . Travis . Whoa , whoa , wait . Where , where ? - Strand took him out the back . - Keep moving ! - Maddy . - There 's no time . - Get everybody ! - Thank you . Thank you . There is no time ! Ofelia . Go , go . Thank you . That 's unfortunate . Wait . Let 's get out of here ! Oh , go , go , go ! Thank you . Mom ! Mom ! - Mom ! - Nick ? - Mom ! Mom ! - Nick ! - Nick . Open it . - Mom ! - Open it , Travis . - I 'm trying . We 'll get you out . Nick , no . Look out , they 're coming . No ! - No ! No ! - Mom . Go . Madison , look out ! Move ! Hurry ! Save us ! - Hurry , they 're coming ! - It 's not working ! - Come on ! - Come on , please . Come on ! Move ! - Hurry ! - Now , open it ! Look out . Hush up . Papa ? No ! No . Help ! Oh , my God . Come on , you guys . Let 's go . Run . - Where 's Chris ? - He 's safe . - Where ? - Outside the compound with Alicia . We got to find another way out of here now . Get back to the medical ward . We get back there , Exner will know . - Who the hell are you ? - This is Strand . He saved my life . Liza , where is my wife ? I 'm sorry , Daniel . Where is she ? Tell me . The infection took her . Everything that could be done was . It was just too late . Where ? I want to see her . - Ofelia . - No , Papa , no . Papa , no , no ... - We must go . - I want to see my mother . There 's nothing left to see . I 'm sorry . Doctor ... we need a way out . You should have gone when I said . Help us . I 'll take you with my family , but we need your help . Where do you think your family 's gonna go ? There has to be somewhere . There is a way out . Past the ICU , the set of stairs down . Takes you through the sublevel . You can get out . But there 's nowhere to go . I 'm sorry . Okay . Come with us . There are people you can still help . Liza . We have to go . She 's lost . Come on . So , what 's the master plan ? - I assume one exists ? - What do you mean ? Have you settled on a destination , an end point ? We 're heading east . The desert . - Should be safe there . - It 's not . Then what do you suggest , Mr. Strand ? Go west . What 's west ? I have a home on the water . I have supplies . I 'm prepared . Chris ? Alicia ? Where 's the car ? Did they leave ? - Oh , no . Chris ! - Alicia ! - Shh , lower your voice . - We got to find them . - The dead will hear you and they will come . - Chris ! Chris ! - We 're here . Mom ! - Dad . Dad . - Are you okay ? - What happened ? The soldiers , they took the SUV . - I 'm sorry . - Christopher . Oh , my God . - I tried , Dad . - What happened to you ? - Oh , my God . - I 'm fine . - ... Alicia . - I 'm okay . Mom , Mom , I 'm fine . We must go now . Salazar . Andy ? - Hey . - Ofelia . Andrew . Put the gun down . You don 't have to do this , okay ? What are you doing ? Just put the gun down . Andrew , don 't do this . Please , please , please . - Andy . - No ! Dad ! You 're okay . It 's okay . Let me see . Trav . Leave him , Trav . Leave him . Leave him . It 's okay . We can 't travel through downtown . There 'll be too many . The 110 ? Nah , the freeway 's a crapshoot on the best of days . I wouldn 't risk it . Do you want to go back ? You 're funny . We 're gonna get along fine , Nick 's mom . Take a left here . We can follow the river down to the sea . Come . Grid 's dead . Generators kick on when the power dies . Anyone hungry ? Help yourself . I 'm sorry . For what ? I let them take you . Mom . What ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I feel strange . Yeah , we 're spinning off the planet . We don 't know where we 're going . That 's the thing . I never knew where I was going . It 's like I 've been living this for a long time . And now everyone is catching up with me . Strange . It 's through and through , Daniel . It 's clotting . Change the dressing , keep it clean . She can survive this . Gracias . Claro . Hey . How is she ? She 's gonna be okay . We made it . I love you , Christopher . Where are you going ? I must stay in constant motion . What do we do ? Can we stay here ? No . No , you cannot . No one stays . Where 's Abigail ? Not here . So why are we here ? Why 'd we come here if we 're not staying ? Are you insane ? Strand . The only way to survive a mad world is to embrace the madness . Is that a yes ? Abigail . Liza . Liza . What 's wrong ? Oh , God . Yeah . Didn 't notice till we were clear . What do we ... what do we do ? There 's nothing . No . No . No . I don 't think I can do it . I have to , but I don 't think I can . No , don 't ask me , Liza . You can 't . You asked me . Come on . You never liked me that much . Don 't make Travis do it . It 'll break him . - We don 't know ... - I know . What 's going on ? Maddy . Maddy ? She was bitten . What ? She 's infected . That 's ... that 's okay . That 's okay . We have meds now . No . - Yeah , you got the antibiotics from the base , right ? - They don 't work . - We can treat you . - We could treat it . - You can 't . Please , Travis . - Tell Chris I did it . - No , God damn it . I 'm not gonna ... you 're not doing it . You 're not doing anything . I 'm not gonna let you do it , Liza . Listen . I 've seen it . I 've seen what it does . The bites don 't turn you , but the infection 's not treatable . The infection kills you like anything else . Then it happens . It doesn 't matter how you die , you come back . We all come back . Don 't let that happen to me . Don 't let our son see that , okay ? You 've got to protect him from this . Okay ? Promise me . Promise . Okay ? I 'll protect him .

If you 're referring the relaxation materials , we paid Ramone for those in full . Over 30 thousand . You know , well , thing is , that wasn 't Ramone 's to sell . He was working on consignment , suddenly dropped off the radar . Well , that 's because he 's at college . The first week can be really overwhelming ... Donnie , he didn 't go to college . Whatever the case , my boss wants a meeting . So , I think you should get a sitter tonight for Oscar ... .. and for Gemma . All right ? I 'll keep these till then . OK , Sport ? Yeah , yep . That 's great , sure . I 'll be in touch . Highlighted passages , nonsense formulae . - Duncan 's book is just a big jumble . - ' I know , and I 'm hoping 'there 's a Vigenere cypher buried under all that noise . ' But we 'd still need a key to read it . And without that ... ' .. There 's no way to figure out which passage goes with which synthetic sequence . 'If it 's even about the sequences at all . ' It could be about something else . Or maybe Duncan was just batshit crazy . - DOOR RATTLES - I gotta go , Scott . - Hello , darling ! - Hello , darling . How are you ... ? Oh , my God . It 's hideous ! - What ? - It 's like you 've been mounted by a llama . Oh , this . No , I had ... I had a chill . Oh , you had a chill ? Did you ? - Really ? - Yes . Expensive perfume .

I ... .. regret maybe ever having met her , but I am not pining , I 'm anti-pine . OK , then , great , you can come down with me to Bobby 's Bar for a nip or two . No , I have to wait for Sarah 's call . You can wait for Sarah 's call from Bobby 's Bar . Let 's go ! And get out of that yeti-like sweater . WATER SPLASHES SHE WINCES KNOCK AT DOOR Gracie .

No monitors , or whatever ? - People who raise you ? - No , we were ... we were raised together . We weren 't allowed outside attachments . But then you met Gracie . So why didn 't you just run off with her ? Hunting people is what we were trained for . My brothers would have tracked us . I thought if I could just find the samples ... - You could trade those for your freedom . - It doesn 't matter . Whatever Johanssen stole is gone . - It was just junk . - What was ?

You know what , cos , if you don 't put yourself out there , then you 're never going to find what you 're looking for anyways . What am I really looking for ? The one who stays in your heart forever , no matter what . ALISON GIGGLES Do you still ... ? Do you still drive that motorcycle ? I do ! I 'd bring you for a ride , but I 'm sure your mother would still have a word or two to say with me . You know , she always liked you . Really ? Yeah . You know , speaking of bad influences , why are you doing this , Alison ? With all due respect , I don 't think that needs to be shared . - Strictly business . - Mm-hmm . - I like that . You know , I know this community . If you give me those pills back , I 'll have your money back within the week , and I will double Ramone 's weight . You know ... I gotta say , the soap thing is pretty genius . SHE GIGGLES KEYPAD TONES - PHONE RINGS - She 's calling . KEYPAD TONES - ' Hey , Cosima . It 's me . ' - Hey , what 's going on ? Long story . It turns out Castor Mark was undercover for the military . - With the Proletheans ? - ' Yeah , and get this . ' Johanssen was Professor Duncan 's lab assistant in Project Leda . What ? ! So , Johanssen had original Castor material ? I think I 'm looking at the box he used to hold it in . But there 's nothing here except old journals and shit . - ' I 've sent you something , Cosima . ' - OK . MESSAGE ALERT OK , I got it . Uhh , experiment notation ... " February 12th , second attempt . " Uh , fourth attempt , no meiosis . February 18th , SCNT successful . " - ' What 's that mean ? ' - Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer . - That 's how you clone . - ' So , wait . ' Johanssen used the samples then , to try and make more clones ? - God complex , much ( ! ) - If that 's what he did and succeeded , then that child would have exactly the same DNA as the Castor original . Well , then , I 'm not looking for tissue samples , I 'm looking for Johanssen 's son . Yeah , he would have needed embryos . Someone to carry the child . Yeah ... I think I met her . All-seeing God , this is thy kingdom . Thou knowest what happens in thy kingdom . Enfolded in eternal life , may the lamb find peace in your kingdom . I 'm sorry . The child is lost ! Leave us . Go . NOW ! Mother ... I don 't know what happened . What happened , Gracie ... .. is that you betrayed your family . God wanted to punish you , so he cursed you and he took the child . Our legacy . And you LOST IT ! I 'm so sorry . What can I do ? There is nothing to do . The only reason our door was open to you again was because of that child . And now it 's gone . You 've ruined the last chance for this family . You will NOT be welcomed back here again . FOOTSTEPS WATER SPLASHES GUN COCKING Don 't ... move . I told you not to call anybody . I knew I couldn 't trust you ! No , no , no , no ! Listen , listen , listen , listen ! There 's a chance . I found something . Mark . Mark ! The reason we can 't find the Castor samples is because Johanssen used them to make a clone . What ? What are you talking about ? He and his wife , they used the original tissue to make a son . We find him , we get a bit of DNA , that 's all we need . Did he ever mention a son ? He did , didn 't he ? Do you know where he is ? This is where Henrik and Bonnie lived just after they were married . And their son lives here now . You 're going to have to pull around back . The kid 's dead ? Johanssen said that he and Bonnie had had a child ... before Gracie ... .. and it didn 't survive . - If they can get ... - HE GROANS .. DNA from 25-year-old blood slides ... Well , whatever 's left out here should be more than enough . - You 're not going to dig up a dead baby ? - No . Not me . Can you point that thing somewhere else ? I 'm not going anywhere , you know ? You 're trying awfully hard to save someone you tried to kill once . How do you know about that ? We took care of Helena . Spent time with her . She said it was you that shot her . All the more reason I 'm doing this . You know , it 's not her fault , the way she is . She 's not a monster , she was just ... trained to be a killer . Does that sound familiar ? - How do you know she 's even still alive ? - I just do . I can feel it . Your people took her for a reason , yeah ? We 'd do anything to find a cure . You must be Parsons . HE WHIMPERS Please ... What did they do to you ? - HE WHIMPERS - Kill ... me ... K-K-Kill ... .. me ... Still big , girl . Why would you waste your chance of escape on him ? He 's already dead . Get moving . Leave him . Please ... Please ... HE WHIMPERS We 've both been abandoned by our families . Left to suffer . I will make it go away . No more pain , little one . Shhhh . Shh ... SHE HUMS TO HERSELF - Huh ! - Ugh ! - MONITORS ALARM SHE INHALES Sleep now , lamb chop , sleep . MONITORS FLATLINE Guards ! You stupid girl ! You say you love boys .

I don 't need you dying on me , brother . - You know I 'm not really your brother . - Well , you are . Biology says you are . If we find the biology in here , then we 've both got what we need . HOLLOW THUD SPADE TAPS - Mark ? I 've got it . - I don 't think he can hear you . - Oh , shit ... You take this and you give me back Helena . You 're not in a position to make demands , now , are you , Sarah ? - What 's in the box ? - It 's what you want . It 's Castor DNA . Open it . - Let 's go . - Yes . Yes ... Oh , for Christ 's sake ! HINGES CREAK HE GROANS HE GRUNTS Sarah ! I know you 're in there . Sarah ... .. you really shouldn 't have done that . I would 've made it quick and painless . Well , relatively . How is that sweet little girl of yours , anyway ? Hm ? THUDDING Kira sure is going to miss her mommy . - IMITATES LITTLE GIRL : - " Mommy ? Mommy , where are you ? " THUDDING " Mommy , I can 't find you ! " THUDDING SHE GRUNTS - Oh , there you are , Mommy . - Please , you 've got what you wanted . - Please , let me go . - I 'm afraid I can 't do that . Soldier ! Stand down . - Now why would I listen to you ? - Because I 'm your superior officer . - And I gave you an order . - No , sorry . I don 't take orders from traitors . Watch your mouth , soldier . Mind who you 're talking to . You were working with the enemy . I followed you . I was doing what I had to do to complete my mission . Which I did . That 's more than you can say . But then again , no-one ever expected much from you , did they ? THUDDING You 're wounded ... weak ... I could just end you both right now , take what you found and bring it back to Mother . - She 'd never know the difference . - Then do it ... .. little brother . Well , what are you waiting for ? - Well done , brother . - Good to see you , sir . All right , you jackass , go and grab that box . We 're going to bring it home . HE SIGHS - You know we don 't leave loose ends . - No . No , we don 't . By comparing his genome to yours we can isolate the defect . Develop a gene therapy . Are you Arthur Bell ? She doesn 't look ready for cult deprogramming to me . I 'm not a Prolethean any more . We 're just supposed to take your word for it ? - Is this your first Sapphire date ? - Yeah . Yeah , it is . - You 're way more than I expected . - Anybody ! All you had to do was stay away . I 'm not someone you can fight , Sarah . GRUNTING

 You 're alive . Philosophically arguable , but ... physically , yes , I am . I don 't understand . We felt you die . I remember the sound of bone saw . Then nothing . So you could be a Bolger . He could be a zombie . I believe that was the intention of our friend over there . I think you 're the first cluster to get this close to Whispers . You continue to impress , Officer Gorski . Wait , if Whispers wanted you lobotomized , then who stopped the surgery ? The only person in BPO with more power than him . - Are you talking about ... - The Chairman . As you can see , my status is much improved . A deal with the devil ? I 'm afraid so . I didn 't think I could be any more confused by you , but congratulations , you found a way . I think both of you can understand that right now , I 'm doing what I have to do to survive . - Okay , Jonas is alive ? - Apparently so . I 'm totally confused . I don 't understand . Obviously , the Chairman was working with Whispers ... - when he took out Croome . - But why would he want to save Jonas ... - if Whispers ordered the surgery ? - The Chairman needs Whispers . - He doesn 't trust him . - Which is why he needs Jonas . That 's it . The Chairman needs Whispers for the zombie project . Disposable assassins . Which he uses to eliminate his political opposition . Mitchell Taylor . RIP . What we need to understand is what does Whispers get out of all of this ? The secret of Whispers is still to be solved . But assuming for the moment that Whispers does have a separate agenda ... That would explain why the Chairman doesn 't trust him . And why he would secretly save Jonas . Because he knew Jonas is connected to Whispers . He needs a watchdog . It 's a painful irony , but my life is tied to Whispers . - I 'm sorry . - Goddamn it . Will , no . No , stop . - This is our last chance ! - If they put a bullet in you , it will be . Where you going ? - In every fight ... - mistakes are made . Is Jonas still here ? - No . The blockers kicked in . - Good . How did you remember that ? I like safes . Mandiba has made a crucial mistake underestimating you . And the power of social media . We 're getting a huge number of hits . We 've done some preliminary polls and you are gaining on him . Oh , yeah . Vote Van Damn , he 's our man . Mandiba has started spending money , trying to recover his reputation . - These are all over Nairobi . - What ? - Mandiba was pals with Nelson Mandela ? - It 's fake . - Mandiba photoshopped himself in . - But people believe it . - Is this legal ? - Mandiba doesn 't care . He 's on trial for corruption . This is small potatoes . But what it demonstrates is his desperation . He 's afraid of you . Yeah . He 's an evildoer . You know all evildoers are afraid of Van Damn . These ads started running yesterday . - He 's a thug . - A thug . He 's a thug . Extortionist ! To ride his bus , you have to pay a safety tax . I was there . I watched him beat this old guy who wouldn 't pay his tax . He works for the water company . He put his fist through this guy 's face . I mean , the guy 's scary . I saw him drive on the sidewalk . He just didn 't care . Vote for Van Damn and all of Kibera will be paying his safety tax . This is bullshit . This is politics . And politics is war . Which is why we feel that additional security precautions must be taken . This is Fred Kimafi . He 's our new security advisor . - It 's a pleasure to meet you . - Hello . He doesn 't need security . Van Damn is security . It 's , as he said , a precaution . Why ? Because if anything should ever happen to you , no one will ever be brave enough to stand up to Mandiba again . Good morning . As if it matters . Lito . Lito , don 't do it . Don 't forget that every bite is the equivalent of 20 minutes on the treadmill . We 're actors . Rejection is nine-tenths of our job . What job ? I don 't have a job . And I can 't get a job because I don 't have an agent . Why don 't I have an agent ? Because he could see what you both refuse to see . One of these days , that shit-for-brains is going to realize that dropping you was the sorriest , stupidest mistake he 's ever made . Not a mistake . It 's not a mistake , Dani . It 's a reality . They accepted it . And I have accepted it . Now you two have to . Don 't you believe what you said in São Paulo ? That we make our reality ? Hernando ... how many gay action stars are there ? No , let me rephrase . How many out gay action stars are now , or will be employed this year or the foreseeable future ? I 'll tell you . I 'll tell you . It 's a nice round number . Zero . Zero . As in my future prospects . From hero to zero . Put that on my tombstone . Lito ? Lito ? What are you doing ? I 'm practicing . For what ? For my future as a homeless , unemployable failure . Wait . Sun . Sun . Where is this place ? They call them love motels . Oh . Oh . Oh , yeah . Sure . Sun . Why are you here ? I don 't know . I don 't know what I 'm doing . Stop crying . Why ? Because it 's not that bad . You don 't know that . You don 't ... I 'm sorry , Sun , but you can 't understand what it 's like to lose everything . I can 't ? No , I lost my manager . I lost my agent . I lost my Instagram followers , my Twitter followers . - I 've lost ... - Shut up ! You have a man who loves you . And you have a friend who was willing to give up her life for you . And you have a mother who accepts you . That is true . And what do I have ? My parents are dead . And my only brother will kill me if I don 't kill him first . If anyone should be on the bed crying , it should be me . But you will never do that . Of course not . Maybe that 's why I 'm here , Sun . Come on , come on . Here . I need your advice . While I am keenly aware that my husband has not been completely forthcoming with me in regards to his business practices , I also know that I have not been as honest as I could have been . At first , I was absolutely certain that not telling Rajan about the ... things , you know , going on in my head , including the fact that I 'm a different species of human being altogether , were things better kept to myself . But now , I am not so sure . I believe Rajan is a good man . Though I say this as something I know I am less certain of than I was before . As a police officer , you must have sensed there was something completely untrustworthy about that Lila , didn 't you ? It wasn 't just me , was it ? - Yeah , she seemed ... - Exactly . Yeah . I felt the same . Here . Lick this . Hmm ... So , rather than allowing myself to be paralyzed by doubt , a mistake I have made in the past , I am considering a more , you know , proactive approach , like you or Sun , and simply telling Rajan everything . You know , I mean , everything that is going on with me and then asking him what exactly is going on with him . Which , frankly , I am not sure I even want to know , but can any marriage really survive secret-keeping ? Uh ... Do you want to tell him everything in order to make him tell you everything ? Or do you want to tell him because you 're in love with someone else ? Your thiamine is low and the lack of iron is affecting your adrenals , which is why you 're craving the drugs . Heroin is not going help you figure out how to find Whispers . You need to eat properly , take your medicine , and focus . Yeah . You will be fine . Hey . So will you . Ah , look at you . Wow . When you get elected , I hope you don 't forget about your friends . - You all right ? - I used to feel so sure . Of what ? Of everything . I 'm starting to think this is a terrible idea . You said we needed to find the Assistant . You said this was the best place to start . Is that him ? Hey , Officer Strange , you coming ? Come on . You want to hit me , don 't you ? Huh ? You want to hit me ? Pay me back , huh ? Do it . Just do it , huh ? We gotta get out of here , man . Fuck all this shit . This isn 't us , Wolfie . Hey , what 's up , D ? I thought you were off today . Uh , yeah . This is a friend . Looking for a missing person . There 's my desk . That was his desk ? It was . No more . That 's , uh ... that 's Officer Boyd . - What 's up , Sasha ? - Hey , Diego . Chillin ' . What are we doing here ? Let 's just go back to the shop . To making keys , saving damsels . I 'm going to tell Fuchs to stuff this gilded cage straight up his ass . Don 't . Why ? I have to take care of something first . Okay . We do this by the book . - Is he here ? - He 's ... Then get this straight . None of your cowboy bullshit ... Okay , he 's there . I don 't care . I just need him to know we do this by the rules . Technically , it 's against the rules to have her in here . - What ? What did he say ? - Nothing . Yeah . Why do you think she would be listed as a missing person ? We know she was scared . We know she went through a lot of trouble to meet with you . - Which means that ... - Whoever 's after you is probably after her . He 's a good cop . It also means they 're gonna come after anyone who tries to help us . What 'd he say ? He 's just worried about you . Well , thank you , ghost cop , but , uh ... I can take care of myself . Hmm ? - Fuck . Damn it . - Rajan . - Rajan ! Oh , my God ! - It 's nothing . - Sit . - What happened ? - A small accident . Everything 's fine . - Should I call the doctor ? No , it 's a small accident . Tell her it 's fine . - It isn 't bad , ma 'am . - I thought your job was to protect him ! It was my fault . - You know how clumsy I can be . - Oh , my God ! It 's stupid even talking about it . I 've just been working too many hours . Put your head up . I 'm embarrassed as it is . - Please , let me just clean up , okay ? - Rajan , I ... - Ah ! - If you need anything ... - Yeah . - I 'll be with him . Fuck . He 's lying . But it 's okay , because without lies , life would be too hard . No . No . Without what lies ? In the movie . Too many lies . From Here to Eternity . Uh-oh . Why , " Uh-oh " ? First , chocolate fudge brownie , and now this . What are we watching ? From Here to Eternity . Ooh ! Scoot , scoot . - It 's Stella 's favorite film . - Your mom ? Yeah . My mother had a copy on VHS . She and my aunts watched it to death . When it was on , nothing else mattered to them . Mom , see me ? Lito ! Burt Lancaster had this ... power . Oh , I get that . They all wanted to be her . Did you want Burt to kiss and drip on you , too ? No . Maybe . He was drunk when he came in at 5 : 00 a.m. I was lying on the floor . Oh , this moment is amazing . The confession of her secret , her truth bringing him to his knees , asking to be forgiven . Empathy overwhelming his male jealousy . What ? How do you see that ? I can 't see that . Please just stop talking about it . I don 't want to talk about it . - Okay . - I don 't want to talk about it . - Okay . - I just want to watch . - Okay . Okay , sorry . - Sorry . Karen , listen to me . Listen . I know . Until I met you , I didn 't think ... Lito watches it when he 's depressed . I don 't get it . Why would he watch his mother 's favorite film when he 's depressed ? I have a theory . I think this is the film where Lito became aware of the power of acting . I imagine the effect Burt Lancaster had on his mother and aunties ... must have felt like a kind of magic . But at the same time , he was probably beginning to suspect that he was different from a man like Burt Lancaster in very significant ways . You mean he 's gay ? Exactly . Which would naturally create some complex insecurities : wanting to do and be everything that a heteronormative icon such as Burt Lancaster was able to do and be ... but knowing that it was not possible . Yeah , but he 's gonna do more . Way more . Have you seen the pictures from São Paulo ? They 're everywhere . They 're blowing up . I know , but right now , Lito can 't see any of it . He believes his career is over . That 's why he 's grieving . You okay ? I can 't go on like this much longer . You 're so smart , Hernando . But you 're so wrong . I 'm not grieving a career . It was my dream . And now it 's over . Every time I walk by this place , I remember that day . You were in the middle of the crowd . Everyone was like , " Van Damn ! Van Damn ! " And it was like straight out of a ... This shit is getting real ! Wow . Sun ! Oh ! Don 't hit me ! I 'm sorry I woke you . I get completely confused with time zones . What do you want ? The Bak Summer Gala . - Joong-Ki canceled it . - No . The police tried to convince him to cancel , but it looks like there 's so much money coming in from Tokyo , London and Abu Dhabi , your brother sent a memo today telling everyone he 'll be there . Which means it is so on . But there will be a lot of security . Oh , yeah , there will be major , insane security . - Is that Sun ? - Mm-hmm . And Lito . - Lito ? What 's he doing here ? - I don 't know . I think he 's depressed . How will I get in if they will be expecting me ? We first considered hacking an invite , but because the police set-up is concentrated on the people coming through the front door ... Security is so performative . From what we can tell , they 're not even checking the staff . Just like the TSA . Which means , we found a back door , literally . The fake ID is a breeze . There is only one little problem ... Do you know anything about tending bar ? No , nothing . She doesn 't , does she ? - Shit . - Shit . Oh ... What ? It 's Lito . Flair bartending . For six months , I trained with the best bartenders in all Mexico . Oh , my God . For my role in Blood-Stained Tequila . Relaxing , isn 't it ? I feel I can talk to you , Wolfgang . I need your advice . I know you know what 's going on , how delicate the situation is . - It 's not my business . - No . And I appreciate that about you , but ... this is about Lila , and the way she talks about you . I think she is your business . Does she ever talk about me ? Not really . Maybe I 'm getting older . I care for Lila a great deal . She 's not like other women . Aww ... I love listening to men trying to express their feelings . I think you can understand that I have thought about marrying her . Was that before or after you came inside me ? Do you believe you can ever really know someone ? Some people . Do you think you know me ? I have friends at the NSA . Here we go . I pay them a not-insignificant amount of money to monitor certain cell lines . Recently , I received the transcripts of a call that was ... distressing . Oh , poor baby . I think she 's going to betray me . Hmm . What did the transcript say ? It was a call from Khalial , one of my competitors . He was negotiating a contract on my life . He was talking to Lila . You know this city . You know this world . I 'm not asking for you to get involved . I just need information . You were right about the difference between us . I want to live as you live , without a leash around my neck . Hello ? Sebastian ? Thank God . Fredrick said you were with him . With who ? I don 't know what 's going on . I 'm trying to understand it . I received a call from Khalial , who 's going to make a move on you . I played along because I don 't think it 's his idea . I think someone is driving him . Who ? Wolfgang . Sebastian , be careful . If something happened to you , I don 't know what I would do . It 's all right . Everything 's fine . Come home to me . See you later . I must go . I would like to continue this conversation . I 'll find you . I know you 're angry ... but this is how a girl like me tells a boy like you that she has a crush on you . And instead of laying in bed , wishing she was going out with you and not her current boyfriend ... she has decided to do something about it . Sh ... Far enough . So we meet again , eh , Van Damn ? So , tell me , did that pretty girl of yours turn you on to politics ? Or you are Silas ' bitch now ? Why do you care ? Just never figured you for doing something as stupid as politics . I want to help . I want to change things . Change ? People like what they 're used to . People also want things to get better . Someone is listening to all the noise you make . - You and your lady should be careful . - Is this is a warning ? Bossman don 't do no warnings , Van Damn . He just comes for you . I could get offed just for talking to you . Why are you talking to me then ? 'Cause I still like you , Van Damn . I shouldn 't . For what you did to me ... I should have killed you . I was going to ... but then I heard everyone talk about it . Us . The new Rumble in the Jungle . Me and you . It 's like Ali and Foreman . Separate , we are good ... Together , we are legendary . Maybe you should work for me . Bossman pays better . If you survive this , Van Damn , you 've got my vote . How long are we talking about , Milton ? You said a week or two ... You said a week or two . Now it 's a month or two . Then what ? A year or two ? It will take what it takes . What about us ? What about this family ? I am trying to protect this family . These people are not like us . They are ... extremely dangerous . I hate it here ! I hate it ! - Chelsea . - I want to go home ! - Take her out of here . - She 's your daughter . I want to go home ! I want to go home ! I have to work . Get out . Go . - Leave me the ... - fuck alone ! Chelsea , come . Sometimes I don 't know who you are ! Leave me the fuck alone ! No . You 're just as trapped as we are , aren 't you ? It 's Sebastian . He 's worried about your relationship . I told him I would talk to you . Okay . Let 's talk . Rajan ? You will stay the fuck away from my family ! Do you hear me ? I owe you nothing ! Nothing ! You 're not gonna do anything ! You know what ? This is over ! I told you , it 's over ! I 'm done ! Who were you talking to ? No one . An old client in America . We just had a disagreement . It sounded serious . It 's just late . - You should go back to bed , Kala . - What about you ? I 'll ... I 've got some things to do . I 'll join you . Are you all right ? I look terrible . I hate heels . I 'm already klutzy enough . You look great . You 're just feeling a little anxious because Teagan asked you to do a toast . And the idea of talking in front of your parents has you battening down the hatches . You 're so right . See ? There 's something my cluster would never be able to know about what was going on . Come here . Wolfgang . What did he want ? He didn 't say , but he doesn 't talk much . Wolfgang . Hello . What 's going on ? I 'll handle it . Riley ... Wolfgang 's in trouble . Nomi . What 's wrong with Wolfgang ? Wolfgang 's meeting Lila and we think the meeting is a trap . I knew this woman was trouble . I knew it ! At least we know the name of the restaurant . But this doesn 't make any sense . And why would he agree to this meeting ? Maybe he felt he didn 't have a choice . She wanted this fight . But if he knew it was a trap , why wouldn 't he ask us for help ? Wolfgang ? Ask for help ? Can 't picture it . Greco di Tufo . We come from the same place . Oh . Greco 's been around for 2,000 years . It has outlived other grapes . The wine drunk to toast the end of the world ... this will also be Greco . I like beer . - Beer for the Berliner . - Right away . - Would she really attack him in public ? - I would . Which means there could be several killers in that room . We need to ID them . Shit . Okay . Amanita , we need to get control over ... I can see your hackles are up . You 're sniffing the air , trying to understand if I 'm alone or ... if this is a trap . Is it ? Do you like this feeling ? The tension of not knowing who you can trust ? I don 't . I hate it . I hate being ... controlled and forced to make deals and compromises I don 't want to make . What are we gonna do ? The killers could be anywhere . We need access to the restaurant computer . How without Nomi ? - Yeah ? - Hello , Officer . I do believe you 're in need of assistance . Who the hell are you ? You can call me the Bug . Hi . I 'm a friend of Will and Riley . Are they there ? - Yeah ... - Amanita . Riley . Wow . Is Nomi okay ? She 'll be fine . Lola says she 's a bit concussed but she 'll sleep it off . She was more worried about you . We 're okay . But we could use your help . In the neighborhood I 'm from , we say , " All the government is someone else 's government . " I want to build a rione ... a neighborhood for our kind . I want to use this city . I want to take it and make it ours . There are many people who try to own this city . They 're not us . And what would " we " do with a city ? We need a place where we can be free , be ourselves . Free of sapiens . Sounds like a nice fantasy . Help me make it a reality . Are you giving me a choice ? If it was about a choice , would you have come ? I 've got encrypted emails from Sebastian Fuchs referencing the restaurant and Lila Facchini . I 'll cross it with the reservation records . Hey ! Whoa ! How do you know that ? If we can cross-check the names , we can verify ... - Hold on , hold on . Interpol ? - It 's an emergency . Okay . It 's happening again . I don 't believe this . I know you 're a little old-fashioned , Wolfgang . Some part of you thinks it should be the man who proposes to the woman , but ... from the first moment our eyes touched , I could feel our fates were connected . I 've got two out of three names coming through . What about your cluster ? Do they buy into your little fantasy ? Of course . We are mai soil . Never alone . Okay , three reservations made two nights ago within ten minutes : tables five , 12 and 16 . - We need to ... - Be sure . We can ping them through Fuchs ' account . I think you might like us when you get to know us . Maybe even that small old-fashioned part of you . All he has is a single Glock . Maybe we should take this conversation somewhere more private . I don 't think so . Here we go . Here we go . Bug , you are a genius ! Well , technically , I tend to test in the high 130s , but really , who 's counting ? So , let 's say I play along . Is this where you tell me I have to take out Sebastian Fuchs ? I promised you , no middle ground . How do I know you won 't just sell me out like everyone else ? You 're not like everyone else . Yeah . But you are . I told you this was a waste of our time . - Wolfgang . - Mm-hmm ? This city needs a true king . These people are desperate for a leader . I know they will go to their knees for a man like you . You don 't understand . This is Berlin . These are my people . And we go to our knees for no one . Take your fucking " mai soil " and the three guns Fuchs hired and fuck off . I 'm going to enjoy scraping you off my shoe like the dog shit you are . Bring it , bitch . Oh , Wolfgang . We could 've had everything . All I want right now is one more bullet . I make a promise to you . You will come to regret not dying tonight . Help me . Help me ! Please ! Help ! Help me ! Please ! He just attacked me ! He 's over there ! Please ! He killed everybody ! Please , help me !

 Another one burnt last night - it 's better than TV . People outside the fence - they took the last ones four days ago . People , just like us , run like cattle , piled into trucks , one suitcase apiece , headed east . At least that 's the rumor . Bakersfield , Vegas ... Who knows ? It 's safe inside the fence . Outside , everything is dead . Everyone is gone . This is day nine . Nine days since the lights went out and that fence went up and our little green friends moved in . Travis says we 're the lucky ones . He would throw those dudes a parade if they would let him . And look , we are grateful to our saviors , to the ones who protect us , to those who know when it 's feeding time at the zoo . There 's nothing you 'll ever take that nature won 't take back . It all belongs to her again . And the dogs and the dead , and the ... Hello ! Hey ! We have to repaint the family room . We did it last week . I know . It needs a new coat . Travis found some more paint in the garage . - What 's the point ? - Semi-gloss ... What ? Excuse me ? No one is coming to the open house . The market has taken a turn . I can still see the stains . Hey ! Did you see the ocean ? What ... ? Still not on ... They probably don 't want to strain whatever is left of the grid . Don 't worry . We 're going to get it sorted ! Oh , my God . Where are you going ? Moyer 's ... He 's making some kind of announcement and asked me to attend . Well , we wouldn 't want to upset him , would we ? Okay ... What 's the problem ? - How much time do you have ? - Maddy ? My house is a refugee camp , my daughter 's room is an ICU unit for strangers , someone has to cook , someone has to clean , someone has to watch Nick , and that someone somehow is me , because your ex-wife is gone . She 's helping sick people . Is this about Liza ? - What ? No , it 's about you ! - Me ? Yeah , you run off to play man of the people with your soldier friends ... - This is not easy ... - Stop , stop ! Oh , my God . Just stop it ! This domestic bickering like it 's normal , that you 're normal people in a normal kitchen ... It 's not normal . Stop it . Stop acting like it is . Are you ready to go ? Please . Do it . Come on . Just do it ! Come on . Chris ? What do you think you 're doing ? Get down here . - Dad , you 've got to see this . - Now ! I want you to help Madison . - Okay , just look at this . - I don 't have time for ... Just five seconds . Look . There . Do you see that ? - See what ? What am I looking at ? - It 's like a light or a glint . But they said there 's nothing alive out there . Okay . Come inside . - There 's someone out there . - There 's no one out there . It 's just the sun has caught some reflection . You 've got to stop . Alright ? Come on . I found this on the counter . Oh ! Yeah , I guess I forgot . Oh , you forgot ? Yeah . I guess I did . - Okay , here it is . - Oh , no thanks . I 'm good . I don 't think that 's the best idea . I 've got to kick it . That 's the whole point . Nick , come on . - Nick ... - Give it to Griselda . She needs it more than me . You said so yourself . I know what I said , but the point is to wean you off of it slowly , so it just doesn 't , you know , happen again . I thought you 'd be happy . I am happy . I just ... Okay , well , if you need it , it 's right here . - Don 't be a hero . - No chance of that . - Hey , Mom ! - Yeah ? Are you okay ? Enjoy your swim . Alright , listen up here , folks ! As Commanding Officer of this detachment , I am proud to announce that we are infect-free for a 6-mile radius around this perimeter . We are on the offensive . The tide has most definitely turned . Yeah . Alright , Command asked that I read from the following - be advised the DZ remains off limits while hazmat teams dispose of any biohazardous materials . - What biohazardous material ? - I need to read this . - You need to listen . - When will you get the phones up ? Anyone attempting to compromise or circumvent the perimeter of this camp will be detained . Are we being relocated ? This is a secure position , so you 'll stay put . Curfew will remain in effect until further notice . The new health screening policy will continue . Sanitation , water treatment and other services will return as we approach total containment . We need medicine . What about that ? We are working on that . Keep boiling that water . You will also find several iodine tablets in your weekly rations . And the people outside the fence ? Where did you move them ? Alright . Folks , listen ! You are in one of 12 safe zones south of the Saint Gabriel 's , okay ? So you guys are the lucky ones . You guys , you get to stay in your homes , ride this thing out , alright ? So relax ! Count your blessings . Be nice ! So I don 't have to shoot you . Yeah . What 's your name , miss ? - Alicia Clark . - Oh , Clark . Yeah , right here . Hi . Ofelia Salazar . Oh , could you spell that for me ? S-A-L-A ... You 're not even looking . Yeah , here it is . Ofelia . - Mr. Manawa ? - Yes , sir . A word , please . Come on ! - Have a nice day ! - You too ! One case per family . The guy who lives here with the covered car - Thompson ... - Doug Thompson ? Yeah . - Yeah . So he won 't do the screening . His wife thinks for some reason maybe you can talk some sense into him . I don 't really know him . We had a beer once , and he showed me this car he was rebuilding . Are you a gearhead ? I kept my father 's Ford going for over 30 years . 30 years ? That is so great . Can you help me or not ? It 's just ... I don 't really know the guy . Okay . Okay , the thing is that I 'm trying to avoid a situation . So either you 're going to go in and talk him down , or I 'm going to go in and take him down . Yeah , or no ? - Okay . - Good . Gloves on . Let 's go . How long has he been in there ? He was acting strange yesterday and then at dinner , he ... Maria , how long ? Since then , since dinner last night . The soldiers wanted to talk to him , but I thought ... I thought it would be better if it was someone he knew . He likes you so much , so ... Doug ? What 's going on ? Hey , Trav . You 're worrying your family , man . I know that . But I don 't think I can do it . Do what ? - Take it easy . Take it easy . - They keep asking what 's happening . They keep asking me if everything is going to be okay and ... I don 't have the words . It is going to be okay . That 's what you say . That 's all you have to say . Will they know that I 'm lying ? Doug , your family needs you . Now . They need you to go outside that door and tell that guard that you 'll be okay , show them that you 're okay . That 's all . FOR MY SU-SU LOVE ALICIA Hang in there , buddy . Hey , handsome . I 've got to go . You have plenty ofjuice for the night , okay ? He 's stable . Morphine 's helping . You can 't stay ? I made some soup . The squash from my garden ... - I have other people to check on . - Please , take some with you . You must have seen a lot of people like Hector at the hospital ... Yes . Take it . I don 't know what I would have done . Hector is all I have . Thank you . Thank you , Liza . See you tomorrow . - Why show me that ? - Did you see it ? I mean , why not show your dad ? I tried . He just ... said it wasn 't anything . Maybe he 's right . It could be just a piece of metal or a window . Or , I don 't know . Look , there 's a pattern , okay ? Someone 's out there . A human someone , who needs our help . - We don 't know that . - What else could it be ? Why else ... ? If someone needs help , they go to the soldiers . Perhaps they can 't . Or they won 't . Do you see it ? Three Two Echo , this is Bravo Actual . Standing by for a sit rep . Over . Three Two Echo , this is Bravo Actual . Do you have to get that ? ... standing by . Over . He 'll leave a message . You 're in my head all day . I can 't concentrate . Maybe we should just slow down a little . Right . Yeah , we should . - I 'm sorry . - No , it 's ... No . It 's okay . I just ... I like you , Ofelia . That 's all . You 're the only thing that makes me believe there 's still good in people . Hey , of course there is . Hey ... Did you get the medicine ? I tried . I asked the corpsman . What did he say ? They 've got it all locked down tight . I guess they 're stockpiling for the big push to take the city back . It 's just that my mom 's really sick , so ... Yeah , I know that . Three Two Echo . Where the hell is ... ? Sorry . Please advise . Bravo Actual , this is Three Two Echo . Finishing patrol . Heading back . Was that makeup sex ? We 've got to fight more . Hey ! What 's the hurry ? I thought that was nice . It was . But I 've got things to do . Can 't they wait ? Come here . Come back . What 's going on ? I don 't know . There 's no news from anywhere . Vivian said she heard soldiers talking about quarantine camps out near Barstow . I mean ... I don 't know . - She 's a gossip , but ... - No , I meant with you . What 's going on with you ? I mean , you 're buzzing around here all day , every day , driving yourself nuts . I mean , you hover , clean , watch Alicia and Nick like a hawk ... Nick needs to be watched . Yeah , I know . Still ... If we 're exchanging parenting tips , you might want to pay more attention to Chris . Oh , okay . I mean , all I do all day is pay attention to ... Positive attention . Alright . How come I feel like I 've been called into your office ? I missed you . He showed me the video he took from the roof . Jesus ! That kid has got a world-class imagination , you know that ? I saw it , too . - I did . - Yeah ? Okay . What did you see ? I don 't know , like a ... Like a light . - Like someone reflecting the sun . - Great . You saw a light . What am I supposed to do with that ? Go to Moyers and say , what ? " My kid saw a light , so your soldiers ... ? " Tell them to drop their duties ... " That is their duty . It 's nine days ... What have they done ? They promised medicine , doctors , electricity , information . Where is it ? What about the phones ? Don 't you wonder why they can 't get a landline ? No . Maybe they have something bigger to worry about . Maybe they don 't want the phones to work . Oh , babe . Are you listening to yourself talk ? You 're paranoid . I don 't want to encourage this with Chris . You shouldn 't , either . So you did see it . Travis ! - It 's Maria . - Travis ! Maria ? What are you doing out ? It 's past curfew . - So shoot me . - What 's wrong ? Doug 's gone . I was in the house with the girls . - I don 't know where he went . - Calm down . Breathe . He 's missing . What did you say to him ? I didn 't say anything . He took his stupid , precious car and I don 't know where he went . - Let 's take the girls in . - They stay with me . I 'm sure he 's OK . He 'll be clearing his head somewhere . We can 't drive inside the fence . It 's not allowed . I know , I know . - I understand . - What if he ... ? Oh , my God . Look , just don 't go there , please . I 'm going to find him . I 'll find your dad , alright ? We 'll find him . Yeah ? Come on . I 'll walk you home . Shit ! Christ ! I hooked it . His wife 's worried he went over . I 'm just asking that you send out one patrol . - He hasn 't been missing long . - He 's not missing . We pulled Doug Thompson last night . We found him by the fence balling his eyes out in his damn muscle car . That guy ... Man , he is ... He 's a head case . Can 't have that around camp . Goddamnit ! Don 't look at me like that ! It 's not my order , but I agree with it . You should , too . You talked to that guy , didn 't you ? Did he seem okay to you ? - No . - No . So what are we talking about ? Thompson gets the help he desperately needs back at headquarters . I don 't have to worry about some guy going psycho inside the fence . That 's a win-win . You could have notified his wife , sir . I 'm not a social worker . That 's your job , Mr. Mayor . But you go ahead . Notify away . What ? My son ... He saw a light in the DZ , up on the hillside . There 's nothing alive there . He didn 't see anything . We ... We went house to house . Block by block . I know . Forget it . I already did . Oh , that 's muddy ! Cynthia ? Liza ! There you are . Where 's Hector ? Getting the care he needs . - Who are you ? - I 'm Dr. Exner . She 's from the government . Cynthia has told me all about you . Oh . What did she tell you ? That you 're the reason why her husband 's alive . That you 're a good nurse . Nurse practitioner - that 's basically a doctor . Where did you take Hector ? Sit down . I want to see him . Cynthia was kind enough to show me this chart . I 'll admit , I 'm not familiar with some ... Look , I should explain this to you ... Cynthia , do you mind if Liza and I speak privately ? Oh , no , no . That 's okay . Of course . I should get packed anyways . Liza , you 're an angel . Where is she going ? She wanted to be with her husband . Where is that ? You used a morphine drip . - Unorthodox . - I ... I didn 't have any nitrates , so I had to salvage from another neighbor . I had to find a way to get the pressure off of his heart . What about your other patients ? I 've already met four people that swear you 're the reason they 're alive . I 'm just making them comfortable . Hector 's the only crit case . Well , you did very well , considering you 're not actually a nurse . Are you ? He was going to die . I didn 't know what else to do . I needed to get her to trust me , so that she could let me ... - So that I can help . - It 's alright . Desperate times . Perhaps you 'd be willing to pretend a little longer ? Excuse me ? AND GOD WILL WIPE AWAY EVERY TEAR FROM THEIR EYES It was under control . I drained it , we changed the dressing twice a day . With no antibiotics , this was always the outcome . It 's not anything you did . We 'll take care of you . - She said that ... - I know what she said . It 's what they always say . How are you going to do this ? We have a facility nearby . - A military facility ? - It 's military now . Fortified . We have beds , surgeons , which I am afraid is what your wife 's injury requires . Why is she whispering ? Does she think I 'm a child ? My wife would like to know how far this place is . Close . 15 minutes . There 's not a lot of traffic these days . I am going with her . Of course . She 's your wife . - This is good news . - Are you sure ? No . No , no , no . Nick ? - Nick ? - What ? This is Dr. Exner . Hi . I understand you may be in need of methadone . Well , I would love methadone if I was trying to kick , which I 've already done . When 's the last time you used ? I don 't know . When did the world end ? A couple of days before that . What 's this ? Overdue house calls . - I 'm Dr. Exner . - Oh . Travis . I can 't tell you how happy we are to see you . - Is something wrong with Nick ? - No . I 'm fine . But your ex-wife , man , she 's a narc . She told this lady I was the neighborhood dope fiend . 98.6 . I 'm going to check your blood pressure . So , are you the one that decides who goes to this facility ? Well , I have some help , but yes . Like Doug Thompson ? I can 't discuss other patients . Excuse him . He worries about everyone else . Your friend is in good hands . Just like Hector Ramirez . Just like Griselda will be . You okay , Nick ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Is Mr. Ramirez okay ? Congestive heart disease is manageable . Your heart rate 's elevated . You 're a very attractive woman . Where did you go ? Outside the fence . What did you see ? Who is that ? That 's the doctor . She wants to take my wife and do surgery on her . Well , that 's good . Tell me what you saw . Bodies . Yes . The infected , but ... Go on . There was a man shot like the others , like the rest . But he ... He wasn 't sick . And there were others like that . When I was young these men ... These men from the government came to our town , and they took some people away . My father was someone of a certain importance in the community , so he went to speak to the captain and asked , " When will they return ? " And the captain told my father , " Miguel , don 't worry ! " They always come home . " And they did . I was standing in the river , fishing , just a boy . And I found them . All of them . All at once . All around me . In the water . My father told me not to have hatred in my heart . He said that men do these things not because of you . They do evil because of fear . And at that moment , I realized my father was a fool for believing there was a difference . If it happens , it will happen quickly , and you must be prepared . Yeah . But what ... ? If what happens ? I must go with my wife . If I don 't return , you will look after Ofelia for me . She 's a grown woman . - She doesn 't need me to ... - Please . You will look after Ofelia for me , please . Thank you . Keep your son close . What do you want me to say ? You don 't know . What ? You have no idea . - Go away . Go away . - What happened to your face ? - Knock , for Christ 's sake ! Go away ! - Let me have a look at it . - Nick ! Let me in ! - What 's going on ? Let me in ! - Nick ! What happened ? - Travis , stop . Look . Let me just ... I 've got it , okay ? Okay . Nick ? He 's gone . Come on . Let me in . Do you want me to get Mom ? Who did that to you ? Are you okay ? Do you want to talk about it ? Hey , hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Alright . This is good . This is good . Okay , come on . Alright . Careful . I don 't know how long we will be . What the hell is going on ? Hey ! Whoa ! Hey , hey . What 's all this ? If we don 't get Griselda to the surgeon , she 'll lose a foot . - You 're in the way . - Alright . Okay . Alright , step ... Good . Okay . - Sir , I 'll need you to wait . - No , that 's okay . That 's his wife . I have two names . - Griselda Salazar , Daniel Salazar . - No , not you . Nicholas Clark . - What ? - Come on , man . Free medical , care of the US military . Run . That 's a mistake . No , no , no . That 's a mistake . That 's a mistake . - Nick ! - Wait , wait ! Hey ! - No , no ! - Take it easy ! Take it easy ! - No , don 't you hurt him ! Nick ! - Stand down . Stand down , ma 'am . Nick ! - No ! He 's not sick . - Calm down , ma 'am . What 's going on ? - Hey , hey , hey ! - Whoa ! - Easy ! Take it easy . - Dad ! - Step back ! - What are you doing ? Take it easy , man . He 's a kid . It 's an old man and a kid . What are you doing ? This is our home . What are you doing , man ? I didn 't do anything . Get him in . Let Nick stay . He 's not a risk . I 'll look after him . Please . - You said you wanted to help . - Yeah , I do , yes , but ... Then get in the truck . We could use you at the hospital . - He knows me . Let me talk to Moyers . - It doesn 't matter . - Just let me talk to Moyers . - No , no ! No ! No , Nick ! - I have a son . He needs me . - We 'll come back for your son . He 's safe here for now . But Griselda , the others ... They need you . I need you . Are you coming ? Liza ? Mom ? Alright , clear out . Mom ? Where is he ? Where did you take him ? Where is he ? No ! Nick ! Chris ? Liza . She did this . Patrick , if you find this , I 'm sorry . If you find this , I love you . I saw something today , something that horrified me . At first , I thought it was unnatural . I thought it was an aberration . But I was wrong . What I saw was prophesized . What I saw was godly . And I think it 's overdue . I wish you were here , but I will see you soon . And you will hold me . If you find this , I 'm sorry . If you find this , I love you .

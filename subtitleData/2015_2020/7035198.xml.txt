 I wanted to trust you . You can trust me . COSIMA : We 're property . Our bodies , our biology . Any freedom they promise is bullshit . I 'm sick , Delphine . They 'll never accept you . RACHEL : Who would you choose as the first face of human cloning ? I 'm not dead . I need you . We came for the fountain . DELPHINE : Rachel is ramping up their agenda . And this has something to do with it . Where are you taking her ? I 'm going to Sardinia . Do you remember your car accident , Kira ? ( SIREN WAILING ) Kira , stay with me . KIRA : Mrs S said it was a miracle . It might actually be something in your genes . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) SARAH : There 's something in the woods , Cosima . Mud says it 's a bear . I think it 's an ogre . COSIMA : I don 't know , looks pretty human . Years ago , he chose another scientist . SARAH : Coady . P.T. and Susan recruited me . We pushed forward . And we created a monster . ( DRILL WHIRRING ) ( WHOOSHING ) Hello ? MUD : Oh , my God . You need to leave right now . ( MAN GROWLING ) ( MACHINE BEEPS ) ( INDISTINCT SNARLING ) Seriously , who is it ? ( SCREAMING ) " This organism and derivative genetic material " is restricted intellectual property . " You can 't let them win . Ah ! I 'm intellectual property , Delphine . This ... None of this matters . They made me sick . DELPHINE : Then we 'll find a cure . Okay ? There 's nothing ... Nothing that 's mine . Hey , you have me . You . ( WHISPERS ) Yeah . You ... You were paid to lie to me . I 'm sorry . Hey . Come here . I can promise you one thing , here . I will always work to protect you . And you will win . They own me , Delphine . DELPHINE : ( WHISPERS ) No . No , they don 't . Yes . They do . DELPHINE : Not your integrity . My integrity . Not your intellect . My intellect . Not your humour . My humour . Defy them . Defy them . DELPHINE : Live your life with every ounce of passion that I know that you have . Then they will never own you . ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Ray 's going to be fine . He had some trouble in the woods last night . Nothing life threatening . YOLANDA : Okay , good . But that thing is attacking us . It 's attacking us near our home now . We 're dealing with a bear , Yolanda . There 's nothing to worry about . WOMAN : Salvador , everyone knows it 's not a bear . When do we get the truth ? My husband would not lie to you . ( SCOFFS ) Aisha . ( SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ) ( SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ) AISHA : I 'm coming , I 'm coming . Hi . ( SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ) COSIMA : Hey , you look healthy . Would it be okay if I ... If I examined you ? The messenger said you 're not supposed to . I know , I know . But he 's such a grumpy Gus , isn 't he ? You okay with it ? Yeah ? It 's okay ? Okay . Can I see ? It 's a lot smaller , isn 't it ? Magic water . Drew a spring for me . ( SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ) ( SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ) She says he can cure cancer , he can cure death . Here . - Look , see . - Thank you . I 'm getting better . Can I borrow this ? Hey , there you are . Yup , I 'm right here . Morning , love . Cheers . Where you off to ? I 'm going down the lab to see the boys . I 'm just trying to fit this Coady story into the mix . Yeah , making monsters with P.T. and Susan back in the day . ( EXHALES ) Wish we could talk to Cosima . I know . You don 't have to whisper . I 'll go upstairs . Okay , okay , we won 't , we won 't . There 's a familiar look . We 're ... We 're talking about Neos . And trying to put the puzzle together . And where are the pieces ? We all have to do our part , love . Your mum and I were off figuring out what the Neos did in the past so we know what they 're gonna do now . I 'll leave the rest to you . - Yeah . - See you later . ( DOOR OPENS ) Sentries every 50 metres around the perimeter . Any sightings , they tell us . We deal with it . We have to find this thing . We 'll keep everyone in their homes . Till he 's done . But he doesn 't want to hurt anybody . You know what we do here . Experimental science . Sometimes , there are mistakes . We all have orders . Get to it . Says she might calm it down . Then they take her . Please , go to your cabin . Stay inside till we 've dealt with this bear . It 's just a precaution . SALVADOR : There 's nothing to fear . What 's really out there , Salvador ? Ana , please . ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( DOGS BARKING ) COSIMA : Mud . Hey , what 's going on ? Not now . It 's more and more like a police state . They just wanna make sure no one else gets hurt . I saw his cage , Mud . What did P.T. do to him to make him violent ? It didn 't always use to be like this . He used to have his own room upstairs . And then ... They started doing these new experiments and ... ( STUTTERING ) I just couldn 't . I can 't see him locked up like that . Oh , you let him out ? Keep your head down today , okay ? There 's a lot of VIPs at the big house . Rachel 's already here . Hey , Mud , let 's go . Vamos . ( WHISPERING ) Wait , wait ... - I gotta go . - Mud , wait . Mud . COSIMA : Delphine . Back in your shelter , please . Go . WESTMORLAND : To an historic moment . All your hard work is finally paying off . Thank you . It 's good to be home . WESTMORLAND : This is a very special night for all of us . The villagers are restless , Susan . ( SIGHS ) This creature that you won 't talk about has everyone on edge , and P.T. is just ... Polishing the silverware . I 'm steering him , Ira . It 's all I can do to keep a hand on the tiller . ( GROANS ) IRA : Let me help you . Just be careful . The villa in Sicily . Do you remember the colour of the roof ? ( SIGHS ) I 'm not glitching , Susan . You always acuity-test me when you want to change the subject . Only ' cause I still care . Surrogate selection is complete . Thirteen hundred subjects are awaiting hormone injections to prepare for implantation . Thirteen hundred . My , my . I 'm so glad that you urged us to snap up the patent on those treatments . All right . Pressure there . There we are . If anyone deserves Cosima 's inoculation , it 's you . More than any of them . RACHEL : Thank you . And now , I need you to pay your mother a visit . Need to assure certain loyalties . Security on several fronts . Well , then , let me ask after this escaped subject . Why capture it when you should have it eradicated ? Because this mutation is important to me . Because life , long or short , is never perfect . I only meant ... We can 't predict all outcomes , can we ? For instance , how old is Leekie ? Could you have predicted that he would wind up buried underneath some random crone 's garage ? I must remember that you know most things . Most . But I need a few things clarified before this evening . Delphine ! ( DOOR OPENS ) Mr Westmorland , Rachel . RACHEL : Delphine . Looking wind-blown . ( EXHALES ) WESTMORLAND : Splendid work you 've been doing out in the field . You 've brought some samples , have you ? Yes , the Sardinian gene bank you purchased is a gold mine . But I was hoping to be on my way to Geneva this week . Patience , you 're here for a reason . Everything will be revealed tonight . Right now , we need something from you . Your friend , Cosima , she crosses certain lines . Threatens sensitive research . What is it you need to know ? ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) I 've hidden the knives . Hello , Mother . You 're looking well . The prodigal daughter returns . RACHEL : Remarkable recovery you 've made for a woman your age . Women my age either recover or die . I 'm sorry . If it helps . It doesn 't . Work helps . You need me for the surrogacy programme . And even though you don 't trust me , I am the only one you can trust . Because Neolution science saved your life and now , you are born again . And because I want my life 's work to go on for a very , very long time . That 's you , Rachel . RACHEL : You didn 't think I could accomplish this . You surprised me . You said they would never respect me . That a clone couldn 't have autonomy . I was wrong . You 've shown great restraint in securing Kira Manning in our care . My care . ( GASPS ) She 's in my care . Make no mistake , P.T. put me at his right hand . Corporate runs the science . Whatever he needs , Rachel . Whatever he needs . - ( DOOR OPENS ) - DELPHINE : Hey . Hi . ( DOOR SHUTS ) Nice of you to stop in . Yeah , I just landed . You look great . I heard that the treatment was working . Yeah . Yeah , it 's working . I saw you go up to the house . Okay , yeah . I had some samples to deliver . I don 't know how long I 'll be here , but P.T. and Rachel want me at a meeting tonight . Really ? So what have you been doing for them ? I was collecting stupid stool samples from centenarians . And they say science isn 't glamorous . ( LAUGHS ) I don 't even know what it 's for . I 'm trying to put the pieces together , but they keep us both siloed . What have you been able to figure out ? You told me to look into Aisha . Yeah . Look . This is hers . This weird book , but it 's got a med chart and a kid 's diary in the back , and they reference naked DNA . They 're manipulating tumours . Not with chemotherapy , but with gene therapy . For Wilms tumour . Yes , a Wilms tumour is caused by a gene associated with organ development , and it normally shuts off in infancy . LIN28A , right ? But with Wilms tumour , the kidney continues to grow and ... Becomes cancerous . Leekie was studying skin and organ regeneration using the same gene in spiny mice . Did you know that spiny mice have 90 % of the same genes as humans ? - Really ? - Mmm-hmm . And you 're supposed to pick them up by the tail , like this . Mmm-hmm . When you put him down he feels safe and crawls all over you . You know , I saw ... Um ... Auntie Helena . - Really ? - Yeah . How is she ? She misses you . I know . Yeah , that 's kind of why I went to see her . To try to understand this connection that you 've got with all of us . You feel it too , don 't you ? I know you saved me when I was on that island . Kira , if you can teach me everything you know about that feeling , then I 'll tell you whatever you want to know about all the grown-up stuff we do . Okay . So this is all the more recent stuff ? Right , so Project LEDA , Project CASTOR , this is pro-longevity research on the island . And Leekie 's book . We know about P.T 's early life . Elite boarding school , university . Publishes on the science of Neolution . Disappears into the jungles of Southeast Asia . At the beginning of the 20th century , the movement goes dormant . Until the late 1950s , when the name Neolution is revived by obscure academic circles at Cambridge . Where Virginia Coady meets Susan Duncan for the first time . Exactly . Coady was a visiting scholar in the early 1970s . So , we need crossovers . We need lovers , benefactors . Men who might have died around that time . Died ? Well , obviously , love . We 're trying to figure out if this man here is the same one as this man here . This was Aisha 's genome when her tumour was advanced . Look , low promoter methylation . Yeah , right at the locus of LIN28A . - ( MACHINE BEEPS ) - ( COUGHING ) One second , I have a hunch . Whose DNA is in the sequencer ? Whose is this ? It 's another one of P.T. ' s research subjects . He 's been experimenting on someone up at the house . ( DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE ) SALVADOR : This thing attacked Ray . Like a wild animal . So how are you gonna calm it down ? MUD : I don 't know if I can . He just ... He knows me . He used to , anyway . I brought my wife here for the fountain , and now , I 'm hunting a monster . MUD : He 's not a monster . And you have orders to take him alive . Listen , people are scared , amiga . It gets near me or my family , I 'll put a bullet right through it . Look , see , they 're manipulating the expression levels of LIN28A in both of these subjects . This is Aisha and this is ... The human experiment that P.T. had chained up in his basement . Yeah , I saw him . I saw the cage that they 're keeping him in . - Cosima , stop . - And they 're doing horrific ... Hey ! You are pushing too hard . They know you 're digging . I have to . No . Right now , you 're risking everything that I 'm doing on the outside . What are you doing on the outside ? You can 't tell me , right ? - Right . - Okay . - Why am I not surprised by that ? - Okay , just listen to me . I 'm listening . Rachel has access to Kira . They 've been testing her at Dyad . What ? Why didn 't you tell me ? I just got here . I 'm telling you now . ( DOOR OPENS ) Delphine , you 're requested for dinner . I 'm coming too . You 're not invited . Just stay here until I get back . LIN28A . Tell Westmorland I found his fountain . You are not suitable for dinner . Come on , follow me . Please . Does he want us to dress up for him ? Yes . ( SCOFFS ) No . No . - Dress or leave . - We 'll dress . Thank you . Rachel 's studying Kira at Dyad . That means that it 's connected to whatever shit they 're doing here . Yes , okay ? It is related to Kira . But we 'll endanger her if you ask too many questions . So what should I do , sit back and just let it happen ? We 'll learn more if we play along . Play along in a dress like this ? Frock that . This is not appropriate . It 's totally appropriate . He wanted to speak with me ? Follow me . What ? Hey . What are you doing ? ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) COSIMA : Susan . Still alive , yes . I didn 't know whether to believe it . You 're breaking bread with Rachel ? Over there , please , Ira . You along for the ride too , Ira ? Cosima . Your people wish you well . Let me see how that goes . Ah , yes . Rachel will be along shortly . Yes , here we are . Sorry to keep you waiting . DELPHINE : Thank you . Susan , I believe they 're onto us . They 've discovered our interest in LIN28A . Oh , so that 's why you 're here . Wanted a seat at the table , did we ? I 'm not so sure any more . Hmm . ( MUD GASPS ) SALVADOR : You scared of the dark ? MUD : No . That thing got Ray at night , too . Not far from here . In the dark , he might not know it 's you . ( ON RADIO ) Sal , it 's Cooper . Come in . Go ahead , Coop . COOPER : Sentries spotted something near the woodshed . One of us needs to confirm what it is . Copy , we 'll check that out . Let 's go find your friend . SALVADOR : Go . ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) You have a lot of dead things in here . Yes , aren 't they delightful ? Yeah . Did you kill all of them ? Taxidermy is the fading art of faded species . But you see , Darwin never would have gained a spot aboard the Beagle without knowing taxidermy . He learned it from a freed slave while in medical school at Edinburgh ... Darwin flunked out of medical school in Edinburgh . Yeah , thanks . You 're right . Yes , he always felt ... Thank you . that he had failed his physician father and his adoring mother . And by the way , how are your parents ? Cosima . - My parents ? - WESTMORLAND : Yes . WESTMORLAND : Sally and ... - Gene . - Yes , Gene . ( SIGHS ) Well ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) They , uh ... They still think I 'm in school in Minnesota . I haven 't spoken to them in I don 't know how long . Uh , which isn 't unusual for us . They 're ... They 're , uh ... Professors and they live on a houseboat , so they 're pretty remote . Anyway , but ... But , um ... They 're in love . And they love me . But I haven 't even told them I 'm sick . Because if I did that , then I 'd , you know , crack . And I 'd have to tell them everything . I 'd have to tell them that I 'm a clone . And then they would know that everything 's a lie . Mmm . Oh , my . What a delicate balance you have . The clinical and the humane . Rachel . So sorry I 'm late . Hello , Cosima . I 'll be right down . ( UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( GIGGLING ) Okay , so Cosima 's codename is Sunfish . - KIRA : Yup . - Yes . And Helena is Shark . Shark , that 's good . Great name . What about Rachel ? What 's she ? Rachel ... is Elephant . Oh , and here 's her cane . - ( KIRA LAUGHING ) - Why is she Elephant ? Elephants are scared of mice . She 's scared of you , mouse ? ( GIGGLING ) We don 't want her to be . - ( DOOR SHUTS ) - Hello . What 's S ? S is what ? What ? What ? - Home . - Home . - S is home . - Yes , I am home . What 's going on ? Kira wants to be in on the , uh ... The action . - Oh . - I 'm gonna be a hustler , too . You just jumped her right in there with both feet , did you ? Yeah . We 're finding a way to be safe , right ? Little tricks and then , maybe even gain Rachel 's trust ? - Yeah ? - Mmm-hmm . Oh , well . That is the hustle , isn 't it ? How do you go about that ? How do you gain someone 's trust ? You have to figure out what they want first . And then give it to them without them realising it . And what is it that Rachel really wants ? LIN28A . The so-called Fountain of Youth gene . We 're decades ahead of popular science . You 're both lucky to be here . It 's a momentous time . 'Cause you 've isolated the mutation in Kira , haven 't you ? Bravo . Of course . Her healing ability is a self-regulating mutation of the gene . Which does not cause cancer . Unlike Aisha , whose cancer you 've manipulated , not cured . You mind your tone . No , no , hear her out . I 'm very interested to hear what else she 's learned . Indeed . Cosima ? Delphine told us you took a tour of my basement . ( CLOCK CHIMES ) Well , so sorry to cut this short . Duty calls , Rachel . RACHEL : Yes , I 'm afraid it does . The helicopter should be leaving soon . Delphine , I know you have important work in Geneva . Yeah , that 's right . What ? Are you serious ? Better leave while you can . Thank you . WESTMORLAND : Sorry to cut your reunion short . ( SHOUTING ) See her out , if you wish . What in the actual hell ? Why would you tell him that I was in his basement ? He wanted information . I had to give him something so that he 'd let me go to Geneva before it 's too late . What 's in Geneva ? What 's so important that you would throw me under the bus ? Felix is there . - Felix ? - Yes , he 's there with Adele . We 're all working on the endgame , but I can 't share information that endangers that . Yes , I know . Right . Jesus Christ , this again . Hey , hey , hey . Do you remember when you told me you were sick ? You remember ? You feel this ? I made a promise . I promised to protect you . And I promised to defy them . This is what we do . I push too hard and you do things without my consent . That 's our relationship . Now , we can end it ... Or we can just accept it as it is . That felt like " accept it " . Yes . ( SIGHS ) This is what he does , he divides women . Then you just go back in there and act like he 's divided us . - Go first . - ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) I don 't ... I don 't see anything . - I think we should back . - Check inside . Maybe it was just livestock or something . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) - See ? There 's nothing . - Shh . Put your rifle down . We 're supposed to take him alive . - Shut up . - We 're not supposed to kill him . We 're all safe when the thing is dead . ( GASPING ) ( CHOKING ) Yanis ... ( STRAINING ) Yanis , please . It 's me . ( GASPING ) MAN : Oh , God . We found him in a Latvian orphanage . He showed remarkable healing . He was our first LIN28A subject . He 's a person . He 's my deepest regret . SUSAN : For the record , I was not the scientist conducting the trails . But I did synthesise the gene . You synthesised it ? And put it in the LEDA genome . To see if accelerated healing would manifest in you . Which it didn 't . It manifested in Kira , the unexpected second generation . ( DOOR SLAMS ) There 's an emergency . It 's in the village now , sir . God 's sake , Percival , what did I tell you ? All right . We 'll see to this . You 'll be safe here . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) You lock the door , you stay put till I give the all clear . That thing is in the house . Be quiet , Ira , close the drapes . - Chickens coming to roost . - These are not my chickens . Yes , they are . That man that 's coming after you , there 's a direct line from him to Kira . IRA : Listen to her , Susan . How are you going to exploit Kira 's mutation ? SUSAN : Don 't you know ? - No , no , I don 't . - What do you think ? We have to know if the trait is heritable . You 're going to harvest her eggs . MAN : This is where it got in . But it 's injured . We 'll find it . No , it won 't be necessary . I know where it is . I won 't need that . Just in case . He 's unpredictable , sir . WESTMORLAND : Ah . - How many surrogates ? - Thirteen hundred to start . Thirteen hundred ? That ... Those are Kira 's children . Sarah 's grandchildren . Do you even think about it like that ? You can stop him , Susan . I can only steer him . And you can help . Together , we can mitigate the damage . She 's a little girl ! You 're a woman , you 're a human being . If you don 't start there , there 's nothing left to mitigate . I 'm gonna stop him myself then . Lock the door behind me . - The roof ... Red . Roof , red . - What ? It was red . Are you glitching ? Shit . Mud , what 's going on ? Is he down there ? Is P.T. down there ? - COSIMA : Okay . - He ... He knows I let Yanis out . Yanis ? His name 's Yanis ? ( SOBBING ) He was shot . - Let 's go help him . - No . - Don 't ... Don 't . - Come on . P.T. , he 's not well , that 's why all of this has been happening . ( MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ) Don 't go down there . I understand now . And ... Why you 're doing all this reckless science . Focussing in on one gene when you know it 's never about one gene . She 's getting warm , Yanis . Oh , look at the poor fellow . - Oh , the poor boy has been hurt . - ( GROANS ) He only wanted to come home . You 're dying , P.T. ( CREATURE GROANS ) This is your legacy . - Yanis . - Huh ? ( WHIMPERING ) He was a healthy kid . Like Kira . And you dismantled him . All this suffering just so you can extend your life ? You 're not even 170 . That 's all smoke . You want to end the suffering ? Here , you can do it . I warned you . Go ahead , you do the ethical thing . - ( STRAINING ) - Go on . ( INHALES ) ( WHIMPERING ) ( COSIMA SNIFFLING ) You gave me life . I know you can take that away . You can 't take away my humanity . ( GUN CLATTERS ) COSIMA : Please , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm ... I 'm Cosima . Okay ? ( CRYING ) ( DOOR UNLOCKS ) I don 't have much time . My flight to Geneva leaves soon . MRS S : Well done on securing that . Felix and Adele are making inroads there . How 's Cosima ? She 's healthy , at least . But we found out what they 're really after in Kira . It 's a specific gene . Everything I know is on here . Siobhan , your Deep Throat , the one that led us to Coady . Can we count on them again ? I 'm not sure we should have in the first place . But why ? Because however they are planning to exploit Kira , it 's happening soon . ( THUDDING ) Hey ! Let me out ! Please ! I 'm not letting you out . Cosima can rot . Think of my niece , please ! - ( KNOCKING ) - It 's them . IRA : You 're not a murderer . No , I 'm everything but . You 've been hiding someone from me . Oh , jeez . I 'm weirdly into smart guys lately . ( BOTH SCREAMING ) She 's been poisoned by Big Cosmetics . What about ... What about that is confusing ?

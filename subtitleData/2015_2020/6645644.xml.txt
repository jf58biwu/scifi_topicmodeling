 HRG : Previously on Heroes Reborn ... FATHER MAURICIO : After June 13th-- - Claire ! ... your brother started an underground railroad for evolved humans . There 's a unit inside the police department to compromise the railroad . Things go to whatever place you 're thinking about when you touch them . JOANNE : What kind of demented place is this ? ( SHOTS FIRED ) NOAH : I need my files so I can track down an Evo named Molly Walker . She can locate anyone just by thinking about them . ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) NOAH : Renautas is using Molly Walker 's powers to create a new technology . We 've got to get to Midian and save Molly . We have Molly Walker . FARAH : Get ready . There 's another wave coming . Focus , child . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) You just have to concentrate harder . I might ... I might not be ready . Malina , the storms will only get worse . The world will need your powers soon . ( GLASS SHATTERS ) Let 's go ! Come on . QUENTIN : Why can 't we fly ? ( PANTING ) Or take a train ? After what just happened , they 'll be looking for us . Can 't risk it . I know we gotta get going , man , but I think I need to go to a hospital . ( ENGINE STARTS ) I told you I 'd sew you up when we stop for gas . With what ? With , like , dental floss ? Come on , man . I 've been shot . All right , all right , all right . ROURKE ON RADIO : I 've been thinking about this Evo rights issue , and the thing of it is , we just don 't know what they are . They 're called Evolved Humans ... JOANNE : " All reports filed by Noah Bennet . " Do you think this is his car ? Holy crap . Do you remember that Evo couple we killed in Atlanta ? No ? Really ? I choked her out . You shot him in the neck . We made it look like a murder-suicide . Yeah , yeah , I remember , back when we used to cover our tracks . The Shelbys . This is a hit list . Where do you want to go next ? There is Oscar Gutierrez in Los Angeles , or I have Alexander French in St. Louis . ROURKE ON RADIO : I mean , think about it - Can you really give an Evo the same legal rights as a human ? There 's nothing in the Bill of Rights that says we should ... We need this . ... until we get more information , we cannot allow them ... I need this . We made this decision together . I know . ROURKE : You know , sometimes I wish that Bennet girl just jumped from that Ferris wheel and landed with a splat . Can we just listen to something else , please ? ( CIRCUIT SCRAMBLING ) ( ENGINE STALLING ) What the hell ? ( ENGINE GRINDING ) LUKE : Looks like we 're walking . JOANNE : Unbelievable . You know how hot it 's gonna get out here . Yeah . I 'm burning up already . ( ALL SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( ALARM BLARING ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( YELLS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( SHOUTS ) ( SHOUTS ) ( PANTING ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) TAYLOR : Come on . Get out . Francis , you 're not cleared for flight . What 's the problem ? You guys pissed someone off . Mr. Harris will update you later . No . Get him on the phone . Now . No , no , no , no . You can 't do this . You can 't send me back there . I can do anything I want . Can we all get on the plane now ? You and the asset are cleared . You stay . Not a debate . ( GRUNTS ) Take your hands off me . I 'll sort this out . Don 't worry . Just get her to Midian . They 're gonna kill me ! ( SCREAMING ) Don 't do this ! MOLLY : Get off of me ! You have no idea what 's really going on , do you ? Can you shut her up ? ( GRUNTS ) ( TRANQUILIZER GUN FIRES ) While governments become more and more polarized and too paralyzed to affect any real change , we must rely on ourselves to find solutions to the dire problems humanity faces . Let 's be honest , if we had to rely on anyone else , how would anything get done ? Tomorrow we finally unveil EPIC . I expect it to be nothing short of revolutionary , not just for our companies , but for the entire world . Shintaro . We can make any modifications you need immediately , but without the processor back online ... I can assure you , we have retrieved the lost piece . The processor will be online ahead of the launch . There 's no need to postpone . ( DOOR OPENS ) Again , I want to thank all of you for your hard work . Everyone in this room helped Renautas become what is today by staying true to our mission statement . " Doing good is good business . " Arigato . There 's been an altercation in the lobby . A girl with a samurai sword caused quite a scene . And not just any sword . Hiro Nakamura 's sword . I don 't understand . She claims to be Hachiro Otomo 's daughter . How can that be ? Security has her downstairs . Keep her in our custody until we know what we 're dealing with . Then take care of her . ( HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING ) What are you doing ? Hey there , mijo . Just locking up . Got a few errands I have to run . But it 's Tuesday . On Tuesdays , I used to go over the books with my dad . He wasn 't so good at math . I think we close up until we figure this out . What about all these cars ? This is Gutierrez and Sons . That 's you . That 's me . I know , but things are a little more complicated right now . I have some things to take care of first , okay ? They 're not going to find who killed him , are they ? I wouldn 't be so sure of that . Jose , things are gonna get better . Promise . ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) ( ELECTRONIC CHIME ) ( ERICA SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( GATES OPEN ) ( CLICKING ) HARRIS : You land in Midian at 7 : 00 p.m. I 'm assured we 'll be online by then . We 're holding Otomo 's daughter in the main conference room . ERICA : Do what 's necessary to get answers from her . You didn 't hire me for my restraint . ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( ELECTRONIC CHIMES ) NEWSCASTER ON TV : Scientists are baffled by recent anomalies in the Arctic Circle . Northern lights have been seen as far south as Fort Albany , Northern Ontario . If Renautas is using Molly Walker 's powers to make new technology , who 's to say that the Evos you brought in for Primatech weren 't used for the same exact thing ? Like , I 'm ... I don 't mean to offend you , but that was your job . Mr. Frady . Remember , construction accident . The bullet went clean through , so say it was a nail gun . So don 't tell them I got shot ? Right . Don 't tell them you got shot . Thanks for the guidance . DR. MOORE : Noah Bennet ? Dr. Moore . Good to see you . I 'm surprised to see you back here . Was just , uh , just passing through . Oh , is that so ? Yeah . Uh , I 'm sorry , remind me . When was the last time I saw you ? A year ago . June 13th . It 's a hard day to forget . You mind waiting here a second ? I 'll be right back . Yeah , sure , go ahead . I 'll be right here . I need security here right now . ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) Two hours , and all we got out of her is her name . ( GUN COCKS ) Women are always the toughest . Either you tell me everything you know about the underground railroad , or I put a bullet in you . ( GRUNTS ) Go to hell . ( LAUGHS ) If this was official , I 'd be in an interrogation room with my lawyer . If you guys are cops , then you 're dirty . So either bring me in , or kill me . ( GRUNTS ) Okay , okay , wait . Please don 't . No , don 't shoot me . No , wait , don 't . ( SCREAMS ) ( GLASS SHATTERS ) What the hell ? Now we 're out 25 large . Don 't worry . I tagged her . She 'll lead us right to the others , and we 'll make even more money . ( METAL CLAN KS ) Check it out . ( GUNSHOTS ) Down this way . ( GASPING ) ( PANTING ) Don 't you ever do that to me again . This is not how you avenge your brother . That son of a bitch deserves to die . I 'm just trying to help you , Carlos . Find another soul to save . ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Uh , where the hell did he go ? NEWSCASTER ON TV : Well , it looks like Renautas is on the verge of another major product launch . Nice . CEO Erica Kravid is rumored to make an announcement later this week . ln anticipation of what insiders are calling a revolutionary new product ... OFFICER ON RADIO : Suspect is wearing a blue suit , horn-rimmed glasses , last seen in the vicinity of the urgent care waiting room . Suspect is considered dangerous , and possibly armed . AH units , acknowledge description of suspect . Let 's keep it nice and quiet there , Norris . ( GASPS ) I 'm the guy they 're talking about on your walkie . Why ? You put a guard in the hospital last year . This hospital . I don 't have any memory of that , so you 're gonna show me on the security footage . I want to know what I did a year ago . Let 's go . JOANNE : Stealing a big rig could be fun . LUKE : Yeah , if you want to attract attention . Oh , come on . We can get you a trucker 's cap , hit the open road , haul some cargo , play with the CB radio , or whatever it is that truckers do . Or not . Why are we still doing this , huh ? Why don 't we just go home , baby ? ( SIGHS DEEPLY ) Listen . I know that you got a lot of sun , and that you 're hungry right now . But we are on the same side . BLT for the lady . Steak and eggs for the gentleman . WAITRESS : Anything else ? My husband might need a drink . No . We 're fine . Thank you . Okay . I think we should go west to LA . Maybe see the ocean . JOANNE : You two always loved the water . ( STEAK SIZZLING ) JOANNE : You ordered rare , didn 't you ? Send it back . Hey , hey ! This is not what he ordered . Pull up the footage from June 13 , 2014 . ( TYPING ON KEYBCDARD ) Scan through till you spot me . ( REWINDING FOOTAGE ) Stop . ( BEEPING ) It looks like you reappear there . Who am I talking to ? Can you zoom in on that ? Blow it up . Do something . It 's the best I can do . Let me try another camera . NORRIS : Wait a second . The time stamp keeps skipping back and forth . Like a time jump . Hiro Nakamura . ( BEEPING ) Wait , stop ! Play that ! Play that . No . No , no , no , no . That 's not what happened . No , she didn 't die in this hospital . That 's not possible . Get a better angle . Those the only cameras in the room . Then pull up the records from the hospital ! I need to know how my daughter died ! ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) NOAH : Stop . ( BEEPING ) Molly ? Hey , man . Hey , hey , it 's me , man ! It 's me . It 's me . OFFICER OVER RADIO : Norris , check in - Where are you ? QUENTIN : We gotta get the hell out of here . OFFICER OVER RADIO : Norris , check in . Norris , base here . Check in . Norris , report your location . Are you in the camera room ? QUENTIN : What the hell happened ? I was there a year ago . What ? On June 13th ? Holy crap . I saw a body . It was Claire . She died in that hospital . How is that possible with her power ? I don 't know . I 've been asking myself that question for the past year . I should have reached out to her . Why did I want to erase what happened ? Why did I want to not know how she died ? Wait a minute . The Haitian said I wasn 't supposed to know the plan . Maybe that 's what he was talking about . All right , all right . Did you see anything else ? Yeah . Molly Walker was there . Molly Walker ? And another thing . The footage kept skipping back and forth as if someone was manipulating time . I only know one person who can do that . Hiro Nakamura . Guess you don 't remember talking to him , either ? No , I don 't . There is one person who may have the answers . Molly . But if Renautas has digitized her power , they may be after the same answers . That can 't happen . ( SIGHS ) MOLLY : Do you really know who I am ? Or do the people you work for pay you enough not to ask questions ? You got caught . I 'm bringing you in . To Renautas . A tech conglomerate that for some reason picked up where Primatech left off and rounds up people with powers . You really think they wanted your boyfriend to stay behind ? They 're gonna kill him , and if they don 't , that 's worse . Doing God-knows-what to him while they try to figure out how to turn his powers into a freaking app . You got him killed . And now you 're gonna do the same to me . ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( BRIEFCASE LATCH OPENS ) ( MIKO SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTS ) Miko ! ( GRUNTS ) ( CHOKES ) ( SHOUTS ) Argh ! ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( GROANING ) ( ARM CRACKLING ) I 'd like my watch back , please . Oh , of course . ( PANTING ) ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Yes . You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I just , uh ... Why don 't you go ahead and check in ? I 'll stay out here , get some fresh air . Okay . ( LABORED BREATHING ) ( SKIN SIZZLING ) ( SCREAMS ) God , why is this happening to me ? ( SCREAMS ) ( HUFFING AND PUFFING ) ANNE : What 's she like ? Uh , What ? ANNE : The girl that you 're doing push-ups for . What ? Mmm-hmm . No . Mmm-hmm . Uh , how 's the new job ? Good , yeah . Doctors are nice . Other nurses , too . It 's a ... It 's a good maternity ward . I 'm glad , Mom . You going out somewhere ? Just to Brad 's to play video games . Mmm . No . You 're not going anywhere . Mom , I 'm tired of being under house arrest . Why can 't I just go out for once ? Because you 're lying to me . You don 't wear your favorite T-shirt to go and play video games . So I 'm guessing it 's a party , and if you had asked , I might have said yes . Yeah , this is why I didn 't tell you , Mom . Because I knew you 'd freak out . I just want to hang out with my friends . Be normal , or at least act normal for once . I 'm sorry . No . Okay ? I 'll be fine . You 're not the only one protecting me now . What does that mean ? Someone 's been sending me texts , warning me about things . What ? Why didn 't you tell me about this ? Oh , my God , Mom . Who 's texting you ? I don 't know . Maybe someone who just wants to help other people with powers . You 're not leaving this house tonight . Yeah . Yeah . Watch me . ( GASPING ) Tommy , you 've never ... Tommy ! ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC ) ( LAUGHTER ) How 'd you get all this booze ? Actually , it was Tommy . Come here . Yup , he just walked in the store , thought about what he wanted , and ... You know , when this kid puts his mind to something , it just happens . All right ! To Tommy ! ( APPLAUSE ) Yeah , Tommy ! Whoo ! Admiral , General , welcome . Finally . Do we have an ETA on Molly Walker ? She should be arriving now . ( ALARM BUZZING ) Help me . ( GRUNTS ) QUENTIN : Oh , man . Now that we 've made it inside the Death Star in time , what do we do now ? Huh ? I can 't exactly go in there and start showing my old Renautas ID while you sneak Molly past security . What are we gonna do ? Sorry . For what ? ( GRUNTING ) Shh , don 't you say a word . I 'm gonna take my hand away . You 're not gonna scream , right ? Don 't scream . ( GROANS ) I hate you so much . I know . I hate you . I know . FRANCIS : You 've reached Francis - Leave a message . ( PHONE BEEPS ) Damn it . ( DOOR BEEPS ) I don 't need powers to read your mind . Hope you can live with this . Get her to Harris . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , help me ! I 've been shot ! I 'm bleeding ! Drop your weapon ! On your knees ! Do not turn around ! MOLLY : Noah ? We gotta get the hell out of here , man . ( GRUNTS ) Molly , you need to come with us . Stay back . I 'm not going anywhere with you . Molly , these people will kill you . Listen , I know I saw you on June 13th , but I had my memory wiped . And you are the only one who can tell me what really happened . Please . There 's too much at risk . You shouldn 't have come . Molly ! There 's no time . QUENTIN : We gotta get out of here . Molly Walker . Welcome back . Hey , where are you going ? Think I 'm gonna head home . We barely had a chance to talk . You seemed busy having fun . I wasn 't . I mean , it was all right . But , uh , I definitely don 't like beer . ( CHUCKLES ) TEENAGERS : ( CHANTING ) Keg stand ! Keg stand ! Brad really knows how to throw a party . Yeah . You think he 'd be mad if I walked you home ? He 'll be all right . You the protector ? How long you been following us ? You know . I kept a promise to keep an eye on him . Follow the plan . That 's a promise I won 't break . ( GUN CLICKS ) The world will need him soon . You know that . There 's plenty of ways to be caught out there . You need our help . TOMMY : Mom ? You stay away from us . All of you . What are you doing here ? ANNE : Get in the car . What ? What ? Come on . Get in the car . Who were you talking to ? ( PANTING ) Get in the car . ( ENGINE STARTING ) Get in now . ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) ( ELECTRONIC CHIMES ) FIONA : We can 't take any chances . We 've gotta leave town . You know , I 've called the priest . He 'll get us out . EL VENGADOR : Everybody be quiet . You need to get out of here now . Who the hell are you ? El Vengador . How did you find us ? You were tagged . They tracked you back here . And I followed them . The street out back is clear . Get to Father Mauricio . ( GUN COCKS ) ( GRUNTS ) Go . Now ! You just missed them . ( GRUNTS ) ( GUNSHOTS ) ( GRUNTS ) I thought I had you killed . Why are you hunting people with powers ? Cops don 't sanction it , so who 's behind it all ? Argh ! Excuse me . Were you trying to hit me ? ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) You were the one that followed me to the warehouse . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( YELLS ) You have powers .

I can 't believe that my own daughter is becoming one of my best operatives . Francis was a big part of it , too . We 'll talk about that tomorrow . What happened to him ? They wouldn 't let him on the flight back . CREWMEMBER OVER SPEAKER : Twenty seconds , Erica . Just because you found out about us ? One of us , one of them does not mean in the bedroom , Taylor .

( CONTINUES SCREAMMG ) The world has been uneasy . This is the breakthrough we have been waiting for . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) They 're gonna find all of them now . If they can harness Molly Walker 's powers like that , imagine what they can do with all the Evos out there . FARAH : Malina , we have to move faster . We are running out of time . We 've got to get to Molly , free her , and destroy this technology . Ladies and gentlemen , EPIC . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) Who was that man you were talking to ? I told you to stay home . You have that look . The look you get every time we pick up and move to another town . But we don 't have to leave this time . We can stay . We can take care of each other , Mom . I think we 're supposed to stay . Why aren 't you talking to me ? ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Why are all the lights red ? We have to go , Tommy . We have to get out of this town .

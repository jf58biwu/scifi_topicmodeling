One source tells Metropolis 8 that many believe the mark of the Bat Brand in prison , essentially , is a death sentence . In other news , the mayor has announced ... PLAYER : John , get D. Ooh . Ah .

( REPORTER SPEAKING SPANISH ON TV ) BRUCE : Excuse me . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) ( SIGHS ) VIKRAM ( ON TV ) We , as a population on this planet , have been looking for a savior . 90 % of people believe in a higher power , and every religion believes in some sort of messianic figure . And when this savior character actually comes to Earth , we want to make him abide by our rules ? We have to understand that this is a paradigm shift . We have to start thinking beyond politics . ANDREW SULLIVAN : Are there any moral constraints on this person ? We have international law . On this Earth , every act is a political act . CHARLIE ROSE : Is it really surprising that the most powerful man in the world should be a figure of controversy ? To have an individual engaging in these state-level interventions should give us all pause . GLEN WOODBURN : Human beings have a horrible track record of following people with great power down paths that led to huge human atrocities . GANDHI : We have always created icons in our own image . What we 've done is we project ourselves onto him . The fact is , maybe he 's not some sort of devil or Jesus character . Maybe he 's just a guy trying to do the right thing . NEIL deGRASSE TYSON : We 're talking about a being whose very existence challenges our own sense of priority in the universe . And you go back to Copernicus , where he restored the Sun in the center of the known universe , displacing Earth . And you get to Darwinian evolution , and you find out we 're not special on this Earth , we 're just one among other lifeforms . And now we learn that we 're not even special in the entire universe because there is Superman . There he is . An alien among us . We 're not alone . CHARLIE ROSE : Are you , as a United States senator , personally comfortable saying to a grieving parent , " Superman could have saved your child , " but on principle , we did not want him to act " ? I 'm not saying he shouldn 't act . I 'm saying he shouldn 't act unilaterally . What are we talking about here , then ? Must there be a Superman ? There is . Keefe . You made bail . Open two .

I logged into your Dropbox to find copy . There 's copy all right . But nothing about football . Nothing about the friends of the Metropolis Library , just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing I told you not to pursue . If the police won 't help , the press has to do the right thing .

Master Wayne , since the age of seven you have been to the art of deception as Mozart to the harpsichord . But you 've never been too hot at lying to me . The White Portuguese is not carrying a dirty bomb . What is it carrying ? It 's a weapon . It 's a rock . A mineral capable of weakening Kryptonian cells . The first sample big enough to mean something turned up in the Indian Ocean three months ago . It is now aboard the White Portuguese being delivered to Lex Luthor . Who I am going to steal it from . To keep it out of Luthor 's hands . To destroy it . No . You 're gonna go to war ? That son of a bitch brought the war to us two years ago . Jesus , Alfred . Count the dead . Thousands of people . What 's next ? Millions ? He has the power to wipe out the entire human race , and if we believe there 's even a 1 % chance that he is our enemy , we have to take it as an absolute certainty . And we have to destroy him . But he is not our enemy . Not today . Twenty years in Gotham , Alfred . We 've seen what promises are worth . How many good guys are left . How many stayed that way .

( KNIFE OPENING ) ( GROANS ) ( BLOOD DRIPPING ) Acknowledging presence of foreign genetic material . Analyzing . You flew too close to the sun . Now look at you . Advising . Action forbidden . It has been decreed by the Council of Krypton that none will ever again give life to a deformity so hateful to sight and memory . The desecration without name . And where is the Council of Krypton ? Destroyed , sir . Then proceed . Very well . Preparing chrysalis and commencing metamorphosis . JENNY : " And so we are left to wonder " if Superman was aware of the threat and did nothing , " was he then complicit in the Capitol tragedy ? " Still no Kent ? JENNY : " His disappearance raises questions . " No . " How can he simply have disappeared " at a time when we , as a nation , need him more than ever ? " CROWD : ( CHANTING ON TV ) Burn him , burn him , burn him . Burn him , burn him , burn him . Something , isn 't it ? We men of Kansas live on a pancake , so we come to the mountains . All downhill from here , down to the floodplain . Farm at the bottom of the world . I remember one season the water came bad . I couldn 't have been 12 . Dad had out the shovels and we went at it all night . ( CHUCKLES ) We worked till , I think , I fainted . But we managed to stop the water . We saved the farm . Your grandma baked me a cake . Said I was a hero . Later that day we found out we blocked the water all right . We sent it upstream . The whole Lang farm washed away . While I ate my hero cake , their horses were drowning . I used to hear them wailing in my sleep . Did the nightmares ever stop ? Yeah . When I met your mother . She gave me faith that there 's good in this world . She was my world . I miss you , son . I miss you too , Dad . ALFRED : You know you can 't win this . It 's suicide . I 'm older now than my father ever was . This may be the only thing I do that matters . Twenty years of fighting criminals amounts to nothing ? Criminals are like weeds , Alfred . Pull one up , another grows in its place . This is about the future of the world . This is my legacy . My father sat me down right here . Told me what Wayne Manor was built on . Railroads , real estates , and oil . The first generation made their fortune trading with the French . Pelts and skins . They were hunters . NANCY GRACE : We gotta wait for more evidence , but the question still remains , where is he ? If Superman was not involved , if he 's got nothing to hide , then why hasn 't he been seen since the day of this tragedy ? You can 't ...

Now the secret to the height is the building material . It 's light metals which sway a bit in the wind . Hmm . And you know something about LexCorp metals , don 't you , Miss Lane ? I 've proven what you 've done . Wow , you 're feisty . Unfortunately , that will blow away . Like sand in the desert . You 're psychotic . That is a three-syllable word for any thought too big for little minds . Hmm . Next category : circles . Round and round and round they go to find Superman . ( GRUNTS ) Wrong category , boy . No , no , triangles . Yes , Euclid 's triangle inequality . The shortest distance between any two points is a straight path . And I believe the straightest path to Superman is a pretty little road ... ( SNIFFS ) Mmm . Called Lois Lane . ( GASPS ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GASPING ) You came back . You came back . Boy , do we have problems up here ! ( CLEARS THROAT ) - ( TICKING ) - ( STAMMERS ) The problem of ... Of evil in the world . The problem of absolute virtue . I 'll take you in without breaking you . Which is more than you deserve . The problem of you on top of everything else . You above all . Because that 's what God is . Horus . Apollo . Jehovah . Kal-El . Clark Joseph Kent . See , what we call God depends upon our tribe , Clark-Joe . Because God is tribal . God takes sides . No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from Daddy 's fist and abominations . Mmm . I figured out way back , if God is all-powerful , he cannot be all-good . And if he is all-good , then he cannot be all-powerful . And neither can you be . They need to see the fraud you are . With their eyes . The blood on your hands . What have you done ? Hmm . And tonight , they will . Yes . Because you , my friend , have a date . Hmm . Across the bay . Ripe fruit , his hate . Two years growing . But it did not take much to push him over , actually . Little red notes , big bang . You let your family die ! And now you will fly to him . And you will battle him .

How about you ? Close , but I am not talking about Lois . No . Every boy 's special lady is his mother . ( GASPS ) Martha , Martha , Martha . Hmm . Why , the mother of a flying demon must be a witch . The punishment for witches , what is that ? That 's right . Death by fire . Mmm . ( CHUCKLES ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Where is she ? I don 't know ! I would not let them tell me ! Now ... ( VOCALIZES ) If you kill me , Martha dies . And if you fly away , mmm , Martha also dies . But if you kill the Bat ... Martha lives .

 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES CHAPTER 05 WATER Hello , Ezequiel . You 're not supposed to be here . You 're leaving- - Please don 't . I have something very important to tell you . Last time I was here , this cube caught my attention and I decided to run the fingerprints on it . I assumed I would find your prints . But instead they were small ... the prints of a little boy . I need to show you something . Who is this boy , Ezequiel ? Who is he ? Who is this boy ? Calm down , Ezequiel . Don 't be like this . Calm down . - It doesn 't have to be a scandal- - - Get out . I haven 't submitted my report to the Council yet . They still don 't know , and they don 't have to know . What is that supposed to mean ? Imagine being confined to the Recovery and Treatment Center until you die . Awful . Or ? You could ... continue the year as supervisor of the Process to the very end , like you 've always done . Then you could resign . And after that ... they 'll have to name a successor . Naturally , I wouldn 't be the Council 's first choice . They think I 'm too young . But your recommendation ... would go a long way . You ... are much worse than I thought . Councilor Matheus told me ... that when he was Process Leader , he once caught you sitting in his chair , just to see how it felt . I don 't remember that . But it worked out well for you . And it might just work out for me , too . Who is this boy , Ezequiel ? Who is he ? Who is he ? Who is this boy ? Damn it ! - Relax , honey . - I can 't do it . Calm down . Relax . Baby ... I keep thinking about how Matheus ' speeches were filled with so many good ideas and references , with dates and quotes . - It 's my first speech- - - Yes , it is your first speech . 5 YEARS AGO 99TH PROCESS What ? - I think you need to come with me . - Babe , I have to finish this . I know . But you 'll never get it when you 're this tense . - Where are you taking me ? - It 's a surprise . Come on . Honey , you 're taking me to the bathroom ? What- - What ... ? - Baby , I have to finish my speech . - Close your eyes . - What ? - Close your eyes . Close your eyes and take a deep breath . Clear your mind . Just keep your focus on your breathing . Listen to the sound of the water . Feel how fresh the water is . Smell it . You create your own merit . Everything is going to work out . Because you deserve it . Now , take another breath . Feel the water . Can you feel it ? What did you say to me ? You create your own merit . " You create your own merit . " And everything will work out . Because you deserve it . " Everything will work out . Because you deserve it . " Never forget that . Whoever said we couldn 't have a sink in here ... It 's perfect . A respectable Process Leader deserves a respectable room . Will you help me with this ? Only three percent of you will have the honor of going to the Offshore . Remember ... you create your own merit . Everything will work out , because you deserve it . That was beautiful . Congratulations . I gave it my best . - I 'll see you later . - Where are you working today ? Well , well , Process Leader , you should know that . What the ... ? INTERVIEWS CANDIDATES How many siblings ? What if I asked you to choose between you and your girlfriend ? Why ? ANSWER : INCORRECT I 'm sorry , you 're eliminated . You passed . You passed . Eliminated . Eliminated . Congratulations . How does it feel to be sitting there ? I guess to me it feels really amazing to be a part of it all . Because we rarely get to be together . The thing is , I have a small daughter . But everything has been taken care of . She 's staying with my mother . And if everything works out , one day I 'll see her again on the Offshore . I 'm sorry- - I 'm sorry to say this , Talita , but you 're eliminated . What ... ? Was it something I said ? No , not at all . The Process thanks you for participating and asks you to remember- - No , ma 'am ! Please ! Please , ma 'am ! - What did I answer wrong ? - Eliminated candidate , Booth 19 . Ma 'am , no ! For God 's sake ! Please ! Any question you want ! I can answer it again ! I can change my answer if you want ! Please , ma 'am ! No ! I can do it ! Ask me anything , one more question ! I can give you any answer ... And then he said , " If this isn 't normal , then I 've been doing it wrong for 20 years . " - Can I make an observation ? - Yes . Regarding this candidate ... and the reason for her elimination . It 's not clear to me . It was clear to me . Reason for elimination number six : Weak psychological construct . Her desire to pass was weak . She had low self-esteem . The polygraph didn 't detect that during her application . No oscillations on the curve- - It was very clear to me . I evaluated her . Oh , sure . It 's just common for us to double-check and try to clear any trace of subjectivity from an evaluation . Yes , of course . It was just so obvious to me . I had no doubt . - Look , Julia , I 'm just trying to- - - Guys , please . I don 't want to waste any more time on these evaluations . We still have to prepare the doors test , and it needs a lot of work . All right ? Let 's get to it . Fine . As long as you 're not doing this to get your wife off the hot seat . My promotion has to be good for something , right ? So , let 's get back to the tests . Walmir had a good suggestion ... - It 's almost over . - It is over . Until next year . Thank God . How do you feel ? Good . This year 's three percent will make excellent additions to our society . What , Julia ? Why are you laughing ? Maybe you should save that speech for Matheus and the Council , and just tell your devoted wife how you really feel . How I really feel ? Exhausted . Now , I want you to close your eyes ... and taste it . Can you guess the flavor ? - Wood . - Wood ? - What type of wood ? - I don 't know . Take a deep breath and use your senses . Now try this one . Feel the wine 's aroma in every corner of your mouth . Honey , how many more glasses ? Our ride to the Offshore leaves in- - - You think too much . - But we have a schedule- - Turn off that part of your mind and just feel . We 're celebrating . - Wait , this can 't be- - - What ? Tell me . I taste ... Brazilian grapes ? And what else ? Black pepper . It looks like the Process Leader has just chosen the wine that we will drink to celebrate the end of every year . You 're always teaching me . This is my second year as Process Leader ... 1 YEAR LATER 100TH PROCESS ... and I am very happy to welcome you . I imagine that you are all terribly nervous . But if I may offer some advice : Remember ... you each create your own merit . But I enjoyed conducting the interviews . - I was comfortable there . - I know , honey , I know . But I want you to watch over the overall Process . You understand ? - I have a small daughter . - You 're eliminated . I can answer ... Ezequiel , does this have something to with ... - with that candidate I eliminated ? - Who ? From last year . - Who ? - Talita , Ezequiel . Of course not , Julia ! This is like a promotion . You are going to be assisting the Process Leader . You understand ? You 're going to help me manage everything . I want you close to me . All the images from the control center are streamed here . The external cameras . The tests . And the Inland cameras . Wow , that 's a lot of cameras . I didn 't realize we had so many on their side . More every day . After CÃ¡ssia was appointed head of security , we expanded . This is very important for census control , population analysis ... and naturally , to keep an eye on the Cause . RK-712 , Unit 2 has just targeted a group of suspects in the plaza . Sons of bitches . Approaching target area , 70 meters . No , no , careful ! - Weapon down . Weapon down . - At 50 meters , turn left . - Careful , there 's a civilian . - Turn right . A little further . Do you have confirmation ? If they 're rebels , I need to show Ezequiel . - Turn right at the stairs . - Back me up ! - Approaching the plaza . - Don 't run ! - Stop ! - On the ground , on the ground ! Get down ! Get down ! On the ground , on the ground ! Ezequiel , 247 . 247 , what happened ? - We just captured a unit from the Cause . - Zoom in . There . Sir ! A man 's been shot . A stray bullet . This way ! And there 's a child there , too . - He 's not with the Cause ! - Calm down , ma 'am , calm down . Situation . Situation ! Negative . Collateral damage . We have a casualty . - Get him out of there now . - Now ! Three , two , one . Let 's go ! Open the door . Let 's go . - Where are they taking them ? - Who ? The body ? - No , the Cause members . - They 're bringing them here . Rewind . The boy . I want to see the boy . Zoom in . They need your help downstairs . There 's an issue with an eliminated candidate . Honey ? Okay , I 'm coming . The agent showed me a totally random picture and said : " Tell me what 's wrong here . " Then he changed the picture and said the shadow was in the wrong place , - but it wasn 't- - - Silence , please . You 've told me all this . Listen ! What happened to me was totally unfair . Congratulations , you figured it out . It 's a really unfair Process , but you have to leave , because this unfair Process - doesn 't want you here . - You 're admitting it was wrong ? I want to talk to the Process Leader . Or anyone higher ranked than you . The recommendations for your recovery include not talking about or thinking about what happened during the Process . The memories can be very painful . The joy of having children is one of the most efficient methods- - I don 't care ! You have to take me back ! - I 've told you a thousand times already ! - No ! Enough ! It 's over for you ! Get out of here ! Easy for you to say . You have everything , bitch . What did you say ? What did you say ? What did you say ? Say it again ! You don 't know anything about my life ! Ezequiel , Julia is a little stressed out , don 't you think ? - Yes . - Have you thought about giving her a little break from all the pressure ? Maybe she could spend some time in the Recovery and Treatment Center . There 's no shame in that . There 's no need for that , Matheus . It 's not uncommon for agents to get carried away now and then . - You know that . - Yes , I know . But what if she spent one month at the RTC ? No . Let me handle this , okay ? I 'll deal with it . In addition to managing the entire Process ? Yes , Matheus . In addition to managing the entire Process . Are you sure you don 't want me there to give you some assistance ? I appreciate the offer , but it really isn 't necessary . Think about it . I will . He 's right . I lost it . I shouldn 't have struck the candidate . - Does it bother you to be here ? - No . Everything 's fine . They talked to me about it . I won 't be working with candidates for a while . I was wondering ... if maybe you don 't really want to be working here . What do you mean ? I 'm sure some of the departments on the Offshore would kill to have you . You know ? And if I went back , would you come with me ? Eventually , yes . But now that I 'm the Process Leader ... I get it . What is it ? You 're trying to get rid of me . It 's the opposite of that . On the contrary- - I can come back . Forget what I said . I just want to understand what 's going on . - I want to help . Something is- - - There 's nothing wrong . - There is . - There 's nothing wrong . Trust me . Come on . Let 's go to bed . - Come . - I think I 'll stay up a little longer . I need to study . After what happened today , I don 't want to fall behind on my responsibilities . I want a copy . Honey ? Julia ? Are you coming ? On my way , darling . Come on . Let 's celebrate the end of year two . - Let 's . - Let 's . - That 's the wine we picked , right ? - That 's the one . Was it hard to find ? A little- - Honey ! Step aside . You 're barefoot . Come on . - Sorry , baby . - It 's okay . Don 't cut your feet . I am ... I 'm sorry , babe . I 'm ... - I don 't know . - What 's happening ? Are you okay ? Yes . I 'm okay . Everything will be okay . 1 YEAR LATER 101ST PROCESS Three percent . In a few days , only three percent of you ... will be in a select group heading to the Offshore . Only the deserving three percent , only the best among you will pass the Process . It was quite different in the past ... Speech . Operation 247 . I expect you to give everything you have . In all these years of sacrifice ... - Location . - ... we now live in a perfect society where there 's justice for all - and everyone has the same chance . - House address ? Remember , you create ... Where is the house ? - Everything will work out ... - Address . ... because you deserve it . Now , I think gratitude is in order , right ? Repeat after me . - What 's the street number ? - We are grateful for the chance ... for a better life . I welcome you all . - Hi , honey . - Hi , babe . What 's going on ? I was watching your speech from here . It was great as always . What are you doing ? Analyzing some candidate files to help the interviewers . - In case they need it . - Oh , great . - Are you okay ? - I 'm okay . I 'm gonna keep working . I have a meeting shortly . I want to see the house . Show me the front door ? Street sign ? Street number ? A name ? Number ? Sign ? Operation 247 . 127 VIEWS We need to talk . The footage of the operation ... you watched it over 100 times . You have to tell me , Julia . Or you 'll end up having to tell a specialist at the RTC . This is not an investigation , okay ? I want you to share your problem with me . You are my wife , the one I love . I want you to be able to tell me anything . That will never change . I know . But you have to promise me it will stay between us . Absolutely . Of course . I had a son . What ? Before the Process . Before I met you . You had a son ? I have a son , Ezequiel . Julia , what ... ? He 's the boy in the footage . How is that not in your file ? I had no family , Ezequiel . He was registered by my neighbor . - And the father ? - He doesn 't matter . Doesn 't matter ? What do you mean " doesn 't matter " ? - He doesn 't matter . - Doesn 't matter ? He never wanted the boy . When you have a baby before you are 20 , the mother ... hardly even sees the baby . They say it 's better to not even name the child , and wait and see if you get through the Process first . So , I didn 't name him . But then , one night , it was just the two of us . I was telling him a story that he used to love . And I called him Augusto . It 's all right , Julia . - It 's not , Ezequiel . - It 's all right . The person taking care of him died , and it 's our fault . - " Collateral damage . " - Julia ... I want to see him . You know that 's impossible . He 's all alone , Ezequiel . In a few years , he will apply to the Process . If he passes , you will meet again . What if he doesn 't ? Then he doesn 't deserve to be missed at all . Because he 's one of them ... not one of us . - It doesn 't work like that , Ezequiel . - Julia ... It doesn 't . What 's going on ? You 're not yourself . We are not ourselves ! Can 't you see that all of this is a big mistake ? - All of what ? - Everyone we left behind ! My son who was left behind ! What you 're saying makes no sense ! - It 's a disease , it 's not you . - He has to be with me . He needs to be with me . - This is all wrong . - You 're not thinking straight . I saw your Process on the Offshore . You love the Offshore as much as I do . I want to see my son ! And who says he wants to see you ? You know that what you 're asking is impossible . This goes against everything we believe in . What you believe- - You don 't know what I believe in ! You only see in me what you want to see , Ezequiel . Do you really think you can change everyone 's mind ? Sometimes you can , but not always ! I love you for who you are . You don 't know who I am , Ezequiel . You thought you did , but here you go . This is the real Julia . I never thought I 'd hear this coming from you . I 'm serious . What kind of job could I get over there ? Well , Ezequiel , you 'd be qualified for many positions . But this is so strange . This is all you 've ever worked for . You became Process Leader . You hold the most important position in our society . You can 't just walk away from that . I know , Nair . You need to think about this . Are you going to throw it all away because of her ? Calm down , CÃ¡ssia . Look , you just have to listen to the audio recordings carefully . I know I 've heard that subject 's name multiple times . So , listen to the recordings very carefully , okay ? Audio . Operation 247 . Approaching target . Advancing via Coluna Street . Straight ahead for 50 meters . Coluna Street . Straight ahead for 50 meters . - Turn right at the stairs . - Turn right at the stairs . Coluna Street . Coluna Street . Armore Plaza .

What are you doing ? Come with me , my love ! Come with me , Ezequiel ... What are you trying to do to me ? Close the gate ! TRANSPORTATION TO THE OFFSHORE You 're not going with her ? Do you think she 'll be all right ? Of course . She 'll be taken care of by the best professionals in the field . RECOVERY TREATMENT CENTER THE OFFSHORE Congratulations . Only nine percent of you ... make it ... Only nine percent of you make it- - have made it up here . Consider yourselves privileged just ... for experiencing all of this . And remember ... you create your own merit . Everything will be okay , because you deserve it . - Can we talk ? - Yes . My condolences . I 'm very sorry . I know how you must be feeling . Has everyone been made aware of the news ? Yes . A story of this magnitude , the first suicide on the Offshore ... It 's a shame that this is how she 'll be remembered . I want you to know that I 'm here , not only as your friend ... but also as a Council representative . That being said , I would understand if you ... left your post . No one would judge you . Julia ... I 'm staying . I 'm staying . There 's no one better than me to lead this ... Process . And if it 's left up to me , this will never happen again . Tell that to the Council . Do you have more ? But I have a ring . Do you want it ? It 's a magic ring . You want it ? I have this ring . Do you know who it belonged to ? Do you know what 's inside ? What ? All of your mom 's memories . Really ? You can only have it on the other side . What side ? The Offshore . When you pass and reach the other side ... you will know who your mother was . Your mother ... she really wanted you to know that she ... that she really missed you . That 's a lie . Go away ! Go away !

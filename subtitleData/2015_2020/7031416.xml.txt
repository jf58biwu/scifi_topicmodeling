I 'm Gina . - I 'm Matt . - Hi . Dan said this would be a good moment to set up all your socials . - Do you have time ? - Sure . [ Matt ] Great . and I don 't think you 've imported your old profile . I 've just been kind of overwhelmed so far . in a good way . I just haven 't had time yet for extracurricular stuff . Wow . That 's so interesting you put it that way . We actually see your profile and the activity on it know who you are . right ? Right . Of course . We consider you a full knowable person of unlimited potential and a crucial member of the community . But you 're such an enigma . I am ? It 's been years since someone so shrouded in mystery started here . - Everyone really likes you . - Your work 's been exemplary . Strong ratings for your first week . Are you satisfied with your performance ? I think I can do better . okay ? - It 's all also about community . - Of course . It 's all connected . like your absence at several weekend or evening events . optional . - I 'm sorry ? - [ Gina ] Let 's start with this weekend . Monday . Was there work on the weekend ? no ! - I didn 't ... I 'm sorry . so sweet . There wasn 't mandatory work on the weekend . thank God ! there were thousands of people here participating in a hundred different activities . So many . um ... and I was home helping out with that . I 'm so sorry to hear that . Is that related to his MS ? Uh ... yeah . We didn 't know anything about this incident . Did you reach out to any Circlers during this crisis ? no . I ... No . two of them for children of MS patients . Have you sought out a group ? - I didn 't know . - Okay . Can you ... talk about what you did the rest of the weekend ? really . I just ... I kayaked . You kayaked ? With who ? Nobody . Just on my own . I kayak . We could have kayaked together . no posts . but this behavior sometimes stems from low self-worth . lifting you up . your participation window . I can 't believe you 've been here this long without being on the main social feed . You 're about to have your world rocked . these are all of last week 's messages . That 's why there 's so many . - [ stammers ] Eight thousand ? - Mm-hm . Looks like you have a lot of catching up to do here . A feast ! - [ chuckles ] - Have fun . forgot one more thing . This is your participation rank . Party rank for short . but it 's not really that . It 's just an algorithm-generated number that takes into account all your activity in the inner circle . That makes sense ? it 's just for fun . bye . [ laughs ] I think it 's for Tuesday next week ? [ woman ] Is that in Building 74 or ... ? no . It 's actually off campus . - [ woman ] Okay .

No need to take it off . shall we ? Is that the ... ? it 's syncing up with the sensor you ingested a second ago . - And now ... - [ computer beeps ] - Let 's have you walk around the room . - [ system beeping ] Briskly . on and on . it 's all collated with the rest of the Circle . You 'd be amazed at the patterns we see and the problems we can avoid when we have all that data . I was thinking it would make sense for ...

Come on . applauding ] [ Tom ] Openness is something we advocate here at the Circle . We live it . We demonstrate our commitment to openness every day . not so much . and we get obfuscation . We get doublespeak . No wonder Congress ' approval rating is currently at 11 percent . [ crowd murmuring ] I 'm sure a lot of you have heard about a certain senator who it was revealed has been involved in some ... very unsavory business . What are we to learn from this ? We need accountability . We need openness . We need to know what the people who represent us are doing with their time on our dime . [ crowd applauding ] To serve us better . I 'm happy to report that there 's a woman who is taking all of this very seriously and is taking some pretty dramatic steps to address the problem . So please join me in welcoming Congresswoman for District 14 . [ crowd applauding ] Tom . I am as concerned as you are about the need for citizens to know what their elected leaders are doing . So I intend to show exactly how democracy can and should be . my every phone call and e-mail will be accessible to my constituents and to the world . - In real time ! - [ crowd cheering ] thank you . shady lobbyists . democracy .

[ scanner beeps ] [ beeps ] So you 're gonna have to leave your stuff outside before you go in . Just because you 're not supposed to ... you know . So I 'm just going to have to take ... this . And this . [ door lock clicking ] [ Mae sighs ] I want to thank you already for this . I love following strangers down dark corridors . - This is the best . - Almost there . [ scanner beeps ] every second of her from now on . And this will be the next one . no . There 's more . What is this ? it was supposed to be a part of a subway but they abandoned it . - Where does it go ? - It connects to the bay . gets too wet . [ water dripping ] And that 's where the rest of it will be . - The rest of what ? - The rest of it all . Santos is just the start . available to the Circle in any way . right ? right ? Look . all of it stored . They can use it however they see fit . We 're being studied . monetized . It is voluntary . And isn 't that the whole point ? Having everything in one place ? that 's True You . That 's not why I invented True You . Not even close . Ty Lafitte invented True You . Yeah . I 'm Ty . you 're not . Ty Lafitte has been off the grid for years . my God . - [ Ty sighs ] I 'm Ty . Why the low profile ? I just wanted to move through this world like a normal person . I didn 't wanna be watched every second . But I do spend a lot of time here . It 's easier . I don 't have to deal with Stenton and Bailey . Not that I 'm privy to their conversations in their little sanctum . Holy shit . I 'm in a cave with Ty Lafitte . you didn 't know who I was ? You never told me your name . it was just weird to ask . [ chuckles ] she doesn 't have a cynical bone in her body . Reminds me of how I used to be . you can 't tell anyone that you were here . Okay ? That I brought you here . Okay . they need to change . Like what ? Connecting the world ? Insuring my parents ? You should be really proud of what you created . proud ? Proud of what ? the use of personal data for the accumulation of wealth and control ? I 'm not proud . This is not what I created . Do you think Senator Williamson being investigated by the FBI is just a coincidence ? and you have to promise me . You can 't tell anyone that we were down here . [ cell phone buzzes ] Hello ? you have a visitor here to see you . In the lobby ? [ indistinct chattering ] - Hey . - Hey . I 'm really not okay . send a text ? Because I wanted to see you in person . I wanted to look you in the eyes . Okay . I ... - The stuff you posted about my work . - Your chandeliers ? but ... What 's the problem ? I thought I saw good stuff going up . They started calling me a deer killer . And then there 's a campaign to shut me down . I wasn 't even online . I was working . there were death threats . I 'm sorry . Mae . I never meant for this to happen . But I ... I can fix it . [ Mercer scoffs ] Mae . Mae . Will you listen to me ? I can 't do this . I can 't be a part of this world that you 're creating . What are you talking about ? look at these people ! Does this really seem okay to you ? Mercer ? I never killed any deer . I don 't kill deer . let 's not do this here . Let 's go upstairs . Mae ? and you were brave and excited . And now it 's all filtered through this . Bye .

I 'm so lucky that you guys were around here . Luck ? Hell . SeeChange cameras saved your life . and then we got a call from someone watching the seals . how do you feel ? [ glass clinks ] [ Mae ] Ashamed . I ... I barely slept . I 'm just glad you 're safe . We all are . And everyone who watched your adventure online . I hope your folks weren 't too worried . They 're doing okay . I understand your father 's condition has improved . Very much . Mr. Bailey ... I want to say how much I value my position here ... and what you 've done for my family . and you 're family . And we care about everybody you care about . this incident has actually shown a lot of people the necessity for SeeChange . I 'm so glad those cameras were there . I wish you would 've known there was a camera there but ... [ chuckles ] is there anything you want to tell us ? That I 've been here before ? the things we hide . Of course I know you 've been in here before . [ laughter ] do you feel better or worse ? Better . actually . I am a believer in the perfectibility of human beings . the possibilities are endless . There isn 't a problem that we cannot solve . and ... we can finally realize our potential . applauding ] [ Eamon ] This is a special Dream Friday . I thought I 'd change it up a bit today and not have a speech but an interview . I had a conversation with a young Circler the other day that I wanted to share with you . who some of you might know to join me today . Mae 's only been with us for a few months but she has made quite an impression . Let 's bring her out . Mae Holland ! [ crowd applauding ] how are you ? - Terrified . - Mm . - Don 't be nervous . - [ laughter ] - Easy for you to say . - [ laughter ] we have all seen but please describe what happened for us . I committed a crime . and I wasn 't wearing a life jacket . but you did risk your own life . do you think you behave better or worse - when you are being watched ? - Better . Without a doubt . And what happens when you 're alone and unobserved ? I steal kayaks . [ laughter ] Jesus . She 's a natural . Seriously . I do things I don 't wanna do . I lie . you had a way of putting it that I thought was very interesting and succinct . Could you tell us all what you said ? I said that secrets are lies . Secrets are lies . Go on . Secrets are what make crimes possible . We behave worse when we 're not accountable . I was my worst self because I didn 't think anyone was watching . I thought ... that I was alone . Mae ? - Was it beautiful ? - [ Mae ] It was . There was almost a full moon . And it felt like ... it felt like I was paddling through liquid silver . sounds incredible . But there 's no record of any of it . - Not outside my own memory . - Hmm . [ crowd murmuring ] Okay . So now here we get into something personal . who was born with cerebral palsy . And though he 's living a very full life he is confined to a wheelchair . He can 't walk . He can 't run . He can 't go kayaking . what does he do if he wants to experience something like that ? he watches video . He looks at pictures . And much of his experiences of the world come through the experience of others . he feels like he 's climbed Mount Kenya . he feels in some way that he 's sailed in the America 's Cup too . And these experiences were facilitated by generous humans and there are many others out there that are just like Gunner . Now does it feel right to have deprived them Mae ? It doesn 't . It feels very wrong . It was selfish . you 're essentially stealing from them . Knowledge is a basic human right . Access to all possible human experience is a basic human right . applauding ] for your candor and your consummate humanity . Now ... now the best part . uh ... Mae has some news . From now on ... I 'll be wearing a modified SeeChange camera at all times . I 'm going fully transparent . applauding ] maybe not in the bathroom . [ laughter ] I 'll be starting immediately . [ Eamon ] That 's right . Mae will be the first Circler to share every single second so let 's give her an even bigger hand ! [ applause continues ] I 'm proud of you . [ all chant ] Mae ! Mae !

There you go . - Whoa ! Ah ! Um ... [ breathing heavily ] because that definitely shouldn 't have happened [ chuckles ] it definitely won 't happen again . [ Laughs ] - You can trust me there . - [ Mae 's dad moaning ] [ laughs ] This is me brushing my teeth . I 'm worried about you . [ watch beeps ] [ exhales ] everyone . each and every one of you . [ Mae ] Never a boring day here . which is a treat for me . I finally get to use my art history degree . This was made by an artist who has frequently been in trouble in his own country . both for their persecution of the artist and for their restriction on Internet freedoms . We have sent 180 million frowns from the U.S. alone . You can bet that 's gonna have an effect on the regime . Annie . [ indistinct chattering ] [ Mae ] Annie . Annie ! Annie ! Annie ! Annie Allerton ! [ Pants ] Are we alone ? I have three minutes to use the bathroom without the video on . [ scoffs ] Pervs . How are you ? [ Chuckles ] - Good . - Well ... you should be good . You 're killing it . Do you think ? false modesty won 't work here . You should be psyched . Yeah . - I am . - You 're a meteor . It 's insane . People are coming to me trying to get to you . [ Chuckles ] It 's ... crazy . Annie ? You look wiped . Mae . You know how much I like to be told right after I appear in front of your millions you 're sweet . Let me take you for dinner . [ sighs ] You gotta eat sometime . no . I just ... [ stutters ] I 'm worried about you . - You 're working too hard . - You 're worried about me ? but it 's good to know you 're worried about me . - I didn 't mean it that way . - Don 't worry in any way . Mae . Your confidence in me will be the wind beneath my wings . How are your parents ? Sorry . [ exhales ] They 're over that little ... episode ? actually . [ sniffs ] I guess it 'll just take some time . Mae . Shit . I 'm fried . And I have to pull another all-nighter . Stenton is on my ass all the time . I shouldn 't have questioned him about that whole Senator Williamson thing . And then ... there 's all the new work on Completion . But I assume Bailey told you about that . Of course . [ Annie ] Of course . I 'll be there at the Concept Kingdom meeting tomorrow . What ? - There 's a Concept Kingdom ... - I know what it is . But you 're going ? - Yeah . Bailey said I should be there . - And broadcast it ? - Is that a problem ? - No . that 's all . Those meetings are sensitive . maybe he 's planning on having you attend just the beginning . you 're in over your head . [ Mae ] Are you leaving ? Yeah . [ Clears throat ] I could just die . Annie ? - [ camera chimes ] - [ operator ] Hello . See ya . [ Eamon ] So here 's how many people voted in the last national election . Here 's how many were eligible to vote . And here is how many Americans are registered in the Circle . - [ laughter ] - And there 's that guy . something we 've discussed with Congresswoman Santos and others . What if ... your Circle profile automatically registered you to vote ? with all the information that the government wants when you register to vote . So why wouldn 't the state consider you already registered when you open a Circle account ? There 's no reason . and they 've agreed to push for legislation that would make your Circle account an automatic path to voter registration . [ man ] Bravo . I think it 's a great idea . Mae . Why couldn 't we take it one step further ? I ... I don 't have it completely figured out yet ... go on . You started really well there . one step further . " It 's how the company was built . Okay . Working backwards from your goal ... Go on . We all agree 100 percent participation is what we 'd like . A hundred percent participation is the ideal . yes . And we already have 83 percent of voting-age Americans registered to the Circle . Yep . And it seems we 're on our way to users being able to register it and maybe actually vote through their Circle account . go on . Why not require every voting-age citizen to have a Circle account ? - [ all murmuring ] - Let her finish . Let her finish . I know the initial reaction will be resistance . how can we require anyone to use our services ? But there are all kinds of things that are mandatory for citizens of this country . Yep . We have to pay taxes we don 't wanna pay . And we have to pay for Social Security . - We have to serve on juries . - Right . not on the street . [ Chuckles ] - We do . We do have to be pee indoors . - She 's right . we have thousands of laws . but we don 't require them to vote ? They are already doing this in dozens of countries . users will already be registered . That means you have 241 million voters eligible to vote . You have 241 million voters that have to vote . You have the full will of the nation . - And how exactly do we do that ? - Annie . Annie . Remember to take five minutes and vote . It 's what we would do with our own surveys . You know that . what about stragglers ? - We all pay taxes . 80 percent of us did that online last year . Why not stop duplicating services ? Why not just make it all part of one unified system ? all through your Circle account . We 'd save users hundreds of hours of inconvenience . - We 'd save the government billions . - Hundreds of billions . We could eliminate half of it overnight . Why wouldn 't the government just build a similar service ? Why the hell does it need us ? It would cost too much . They don 't have the expertise . - We already have the infrastructure . - [ Eamon ] You 're absolutely right . The government needs us more than we need them . Imagine having the full will of the people . Instantly . You 'd have ... true democracy for the first time in human history . - [ Annie ] This is such bullshit . - [ door opens ] [ door closes ] No voter suppression . You 're voting from home . Think of the implications for totalitarian regimes . No more rigged elections . The UN can demand that they 're held through the Circle . - But only if everyone is heard . - [ murmuring ] Every human on Earth . everyone in the world in seconds on any subject . right ? - Right . [ all ] Yeah ! So it looks like I 've got 20 minutes here . Let 's try Mom and Dad . what 's up ? - Hi . - [ laughter ] where have you been ? - Mae . I 've seen your cameras aren 't working . I can send Tech out ... we disconnected them . - Sweetheart ... - [ sighs ] we can 't keep doing this . it 's more than we ever ... and we don 't wanna ... - We love you . We love you . - We have to have our privacy . And we 're worried you don 't realize what you 've gotten yourself into . I 'm so sorry . I didn 't mean to hurt you . we know that . it 's us . - We just need you to understand that . [ sighs ] - I love you . - We love you too . honey . [ sniffles ] Mae ! [ sighs ] applauding ] [ man hooting ] applauding ] [ laughs ] Okay . when all of humanity is connected and united . And it will happen . 22 nations have agreed in principle to operate their elections through the Circle with mandatory participation from all of its citizens . applauding ] they can be better served . who don 't want to be woven into the fabric of society want to tear out that fabric ? I want to introduce Soul Search . here and globally . Do you feel ready ? yeah ! - [ all cheering ] [ Tom ] You went well so far . Great . a proven menace to our global community . Soul Search will locate them in under 20 minutes . - [ woman ] Wow . - [ crowd applauding ] Let 's select that fugitive . Okay . England . She was convicted of triple murder in 2004 . She locked her three children in the closet and went on holiday to Spain . [ crowd murmuring ] They all starved . She was sent to prison in England but escaped with the help of a guard who she apparently seduced . Over a billion people are watching . Let 's see how many are in the UK . Do you all think 14 million Brits and a billion global participants worldwide can find Fiona Highbridge in under 20 minutes ? - [ crowd cheering ] - [ woman ] Yeah ! [ man ] Yeah ! All right . Let 's bring up the clock . Good . - Is everyone ready ? - [ crowd cheering ] On your mark ... get set ... go ! [ crowd continuously cheering ] [ laughter ] time to get serious . Mae . [ crowd applauding ] That 's her . Be careful . I will . - [ crowd cheering ] - [ man ] Whoa ! [ man ] Whoa ! [ woman ] Fiona ! Stop ! - Follow her . - Stop her ! Somebody stop her ! She 's a killer ! Stop her ! Somebody stop her ! - [ woman ] Go ! - [ man ] Grab her ! Stop her ! Somebody grab her ! - [ Tom ] She must be kept safe . - Keep her safe . - It 's Fiona Highbridge ! - [ Fiona ] No ! No ! No ! applauding ] [ indistinct chattering ] [ man ] All right . Watch it . [ Fiona ] No . [ crowd cheering ] Stop the clock . baby ! - I guess that 's it . - [ crowd cheering and applauding ] [ woman ] Let 's do another ! We could . - Um ... - [ Tom ] Maybe not a fugitive this time . Let 's try for a regular civilian . everyone . We 're gonna find a regular person . It can be anyone . a lost love . we can never lose a friend . We can take a suggestion from the audience . - Uh ... anyone ? - [ woman ] Find Mercer ! hooting ] I 'm pretty sure he doesn 't wanna be found . [ Chuckles ] - Anyone else ? - [ man ] Where 's Mercer ? this is what Soul Search is all about as well as Completion . Other suggestions ? - [ woman ] Let 's try Mercer . - [ crowd ] Mercer ! Mercer ! Mercer ! Mae . No . [ crowd ] Mercer ! Mercer ! no . I ... this is the right choice . everybody . - [ crowd cheering and applauding ] - [ Eamon ] Hey . don 't you ? [ crowd cheering ] okay ? The perfect use of Soul Search . Let 's find your friend . applauding ] now . Okay . um ... a friendship . [ laughter ] This is my friend Mercer . I haven 't seen him in a while . I 'd love to see him again . he 's not a criminal . people . Let 's see if we can break our previous record . Whoo ! [ breathes heavily ] yeah . Unbelievable . Can you believe that ? Yes ! [ man ] Do you think he 's in here ? - Mercer ! - [ man ] Mercer ! are you in there ? making chandeliers ? [ audience laughing ] we know you 're in there . We see your truck . It 's right here . - [ man ] I think he 's in there . - Fine . Let 's go around . he 's in there ! - [ crowd laughing ] come out . He 's gotta be here . okay ? we know you 're in there . You found where he is . You did it . I think we should leave . stay on this . You 've got millions of people enjoying this . [ woman ] There he is . There he is . There he is . We just got Mercer . I cannot believe this . [ woman ] There he is ! He 's in the driveway ! [ engine starting ] [ Mercer ] Leave me alone ! Jesus Christ ! [ crowd cheering ] [ crowd continuously cheering ] [ motorcycle revving ] [ whispers ] You 're kidding me . [ crowd cheering ] Can someone please get me audio on the camera ? Mercer . stop driving . It 's just me . stop the truck . You 're surrounded by friends . [ car honking ] Can we turn the speaker up ? Mercer . Can you hear me ? it 's me . [ whispers ] You 're surrounded by friends . [ crowd murmuring ] stop . [ grunts ] [ screams ] [ birds chirping ] - [ knocking on door ] - [ door opens ] sweetie ? You 've been in bed for three days . okay ? I 've got some new snapdragons that need to be planted . Okay ? Honey . honey . - [ sniffles ] - Oh . - Oh . - [ sobs ] [ announcer over radio ] The California Department of Motor Vehicles has proposed regulation that self-driving cars should be required to have a licensed driver inside . Is that a good principle ? we would not suggest putting something unsafe on the road . That 's why we have fed ... [ sighs ] [ line ringing ] Mae . Where are you ? - Are we alone ? - Yes . Are we ? Yes . How is it daytime where you are ? you 're in Scotland . I went home . Can you see ? What happened ? besides almost ODing on speed and Soylent ? I found out I 'm allergic to wheat . [ both chuckling ] Um ... I don 't know . I guess I almost died ? don 't . Don 't make me cry . Come on . No . I 'm not going to cry anymore . You getting better there ? I am . and I think I daydream . Hadn 't done that in years . I 'm glad you called . too . I know . really sorry about Mercer . And I 'm a shit friend . I should 've said something sooner . and I 'm sorry . It 's just so horrible . Have they spoken to you about it ? Not yet . I 'm going in tomorrow . Uh-huh . They ask for forgiveness and never for permission . They have to go . They 've broken a hundred laws . They 've made me suffer a thousand regulations . There 's got to be a way to ... What ? Stop people doing bad shit ? [ scoffs ] Yeah . too ? I 've got an extra bed if you want it . [ chuckles ] just being with you . - Even like this . - Yeah . Yeah . I know . This is going to sound crazy . But ... I keep having this feeling that ... Mercer would still be here if we hadn 't lost touch . what were you supposed to do ? he drifted away . It happens . all this power . technology didn 't exactly help the situation . What if it could ? [ coffee maker clanking ] and your light was still on . What were you doing in your room ? Were you on the phone ? It helped . I have friends all over the world . They care . Mm . - I spoke to Annie . - [ Mom ] How is she ? Good . Better . I realized how much I missed her . I have to go back . Go back where ? Not to the Circle . Mom . a bad system . It ... It can be fixed . Mom . you make them safer . at least wait a bit . - [ sighs ] I 'm the only one who can do this . I 'm sorry . I love you . [ line ringing ] it 's me . Mae . How are you holding up ? actually . I 'm coming in to see them today . anything you need . [ Eamon ] We were worried when we didn 't hear from you for so long . [ Tom ] We were very concerned . No contact for four days . Your camera was off . How are you doing ? I 'm okay . Tom and I have been talking about how little we knew about this young man Mercer . He 's someone we should have been able to help . A fund should be established for his family . that 's done . we would like to offer you a new role maybe a lighter schedule . and you can think long-term . if you wanted . - [ Tom laughs ] Ty Lafitte ... - Yeah . and now he loves his freedom . but at our next Dream Friday ... [ stammers ] We 're going to imagine a world in which every disturbed young man could be kept safe . Would you like to join us ? I 'm not sure I 'm ready for that . But ... thanks for the invitation . Take your time . [ indistinct chattering ] [ cell phone buzzing ] I did what you asked . You won 't believe the shit I found . I 'm so sorry . but they should build a monument to Mercer . this ... this changes everything . right ? and it changes everything . [ operator ] Hello . Hello again . Mae . but we didn 't have the technology . But we will . and optimize Circle services across all platforms . Shopping . Lodging . Attractions . Attractions like Mae Holland . come on out here . - [ crowd cheering ] Mae . you 're transparent again . Look at that . hello . Mae Holland . Mae ! Mae is a brave person really . Eamon . And I couldn 't agree with you more . too . Tom ? You want to come out ? - [ crowd applauding ] - Come on . - There you are . I want to thank everyone here and around the world for the support you 've given me since we lost Mercer . I 've realized something about myself and about the Circle . It 's that I don 't want to be disconnected . my loved ones . We lost track of Mercer . But what if we never lost touch with each other ? What if instead of searching ... we always knew ? What I am proposing is radical openness and unbroken connection . It would have to start here . - [ crowd applauding ] - Mm-hm . You know the usual hypocrisy of the digital world . and yet our leaders ... live above it . So I want to invite Eamon and Tom to join me in this experiment that they 've pioneered . I invite them to set an example for the Circle and the world ... to go transparent . applauding ] guys ? Will you join me ? their every word ? never erased . Ty Lafitte has helped us make every document in the company 's history public . every plan including ... and their private accounts ... [ crowd murmuring ] and their secondary confidential accounts . [ Chuckles ] not even their assistants or wives knew existed . Until now . It 's all been sent to you already . [ murmuring ] We are so fucked . I think we 're entitled to that kind of access . Don 't you ? - [ all ] Yeah . - [ hooting ] you are a very brave woman to do this . There are no more secrets . Privacy was a temporary thing . And now it 's over . We won 't live in the shadows anymore . Hey . Good timing . [ Chuckles ] [ cell phones beeping ] [ indistinct chattering ] Thank you . Thank you . the difference between public and private . Aren 't you all ? I 'm tired of standing here in the dark . Don 't worry . Eamon will catch up . Or maybe he won 't . it 's time for a change .

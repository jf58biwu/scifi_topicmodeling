 This is Lyndsey Bird , reporting live from the White House , where the Secretary of Defense has confirmed that the internet kill switch has been initiated due to cyber terrorism . Unconfirmed reports of catastrophic failure in global telenet and communications systems . Trading on all major financial markets has been suspended indefinitely . They 're calling it the Drek Virus . The Prime Minister has declared a state of emergency . The source of the virus , which has crippled the core of modern society , remains a mystery . As food and water grow scarce , people want answers , and they 're tired of waiting . Despite martial law another violent day of riots and unrest . The D.O.D. confirms that the Drek Virus has gone global , forcing the worldwide economy to stop all foreign trade . The President has declared a state of emergency . Rioting and looting are flooding the streets here in Washington . We 're being told to evacuate the area by the National Guard . The death toll continues to rise . I 'm getting a report that we 're going off the air now . Good night and good luck to all of you . Godspeed . What 's your poison ? Red Eye . That 's gonna cost ya . You know how much it cost 's to keep that generator running outside ? Just pour the drink . Ain 't seen you around here before . Looking for someone . You a chaser ? Listen , I don 't want any trouble . Relax . Just looking for a man . Calls himself " Ringo . " Can 't say I heard of him . Big guy in his forties . Wears an eye patch . A real eyesore if you ask me . You sure you haven 't seen him ? What are you after him for ? He robbed a supply caravan en route to Union City . Killed a couple of troopers in the process . Isn 't that right Ringo ? And what do they call you ? What 's it to you ? I always like to know the name of a man before I cut him to pieces . If I were you I wouldn 't try that . The way I see it you have two options . You can walk out of here real peaceful like , or I can carry you out . What 's it gonna be ? I 've got news for you , Union Man . This is the Barrens . Your rules , don 't apply here . Wrong answer . By the way , the name 's Dresher . Keep going ! Dresher . Brennan . Been tracking this maggot for weeks . So why don 't you throw a little professional courtesy my way and hand him over . I wasn 't asking . Get in Ringo . You ... throw away the piece . I 'll remember this . I 'll see you back in Union City , Dresher . We 'll have a drink . I 'll even buy . Whaddya know . This day keeps getting better and better . ARGH ! Son of a bitch . Dresher ! Are you kidding me ? Dresher get me out of this . Did you do this ? Did you set a trap ? You should keep your distance . You son of a bitch . You 're not taking him . You 're not taking my bike . My bike is worth more than your life . You might want this . Maybe not . C 'mon man you can 't leave me out here for the wolves . Dresher ! You can 't leave me out here . Dresher ! I swear , the next time I see you , your ass , is mine ! Son , where I come from there are two types of people , thieves , and takers . And you son , you are a taker . You have taken advantage of my kindness . You come into my house and you do not bring the payment you owe me . And you expect me to give you some kind of leniency ? Shamrock please . I didn 't mean to disrespect you . I can pay you what I owe you . I just need some more time . Time ? Take a look around yourself son . Time is something that none of us have . And yours has just run out . You 're going back to the prison mines . No ! No please . I 'll give you anything you want . You don 't have anything that I want . Get him out of here . No ! Not the mine ! Anywhere but the mine ! No please , anything Shamrock no ! No ! Well well well . Look at who just breezed in . Shamrock . You know Dresher , I 'd given you up for dead . You did get him right ? I got him . How long has it been ? What , I sent you out after Ringo more than a week ago . You know Dresher , there was a time when you could track a bounty before the sun could set and the moon could rise . What happened ? Is that why you sent Brennan after my mark ? Brennan ? Brennan . Oh Brennan ! Oh right . Have you seen that arrogant little prick lately ? Yeah in The Barrens where I left him . Don 't ever send another chaser after my bounty . You got that ? Heh heh heh . You know Dresher , if I was you , I would start to sleep with one eye open . I 'll take my chances . Where 's my gold ? Yep . I got your payment for you right here . Pay him . Also got something else you might be interested in . I doubt it . Hold it . This is serious . Now , something is going down . Something big . You ever hear of the name Anson ? John Anson ? Once maybe . Yeah well the word is he has a gang that rides with him . Call themselves the Black Sashes . They 've been scrounging around in the Barrens ever since this world went to shit . Now , they 've been causing all kinds of grief and havoc . Raping women , burning towns . The whole nine yards . Your point ? The Union has put a price on his head and they must want him really really bad because this is the biggest payday I 've ever seen . Thirty kilos of gold prime . Thirty . Kilos ? You also know that every tracker is gonna be out there , gunning for him . Here are the goods . I want you to do what you do well . I don 't give a shit if all his limbs are missing . I have one request . You bring him back alive . I 'll give it some thought . Yeah well I wouldn 't think about it too long Dresher . You know there 's always ... Brennan . You should really tell me when you plan on stopping by . You should really learn to lock your doors at sundown , Reverend Raines . My doors are always open . This is God 's house , remember ? What 's God gonna do when a gang comes in here and steals everything you have ? I 'm gonna do what the good lord gave me the common sense to do . I 'm gonna shoot ' em . Heh . Gonna shoot ' em ? Look at you . Red Eye . The Devil 's Kool Aid . I am not in the mood for a sermon . You know Dresher , before this all happened , before the world dilapidated , I did a lot of bad things . Did harm to some good people who didn 't deserve it . Here we go . I remember once I robbed a liquor store . This kid was behind the counter . When I put that gun in his face , he looked at me . Wasn 't a look of fear . Not anger . It was solace . Like somehow I was about to release that kid from a life of pain . Sometimes I see that same look in your face my friend . Told you I was in no mood for a sermon . And I don 't wanna be released . Bullshit . You got no past . You got no future . A man with no memory of who he is a dangerous man . Point is , you may never know who you really are , and sometime you 're gonna have to come to terms with that . Appreciate the bed . Reverend , the liquor store . What happened ? It 's open . Aaryn Honey , there 's somebody here to see you . Can 't you see I 'm with a client ? He won 't take no for an answer . Aaryn . How ya been ? I 've been , great Dresher . How 've you been ? I need to talk to you . Well , I 'm a real busy right now . It won 't take long . What do you want ? I 'm after a mark . You never change do you ? You haven 't shown your face in almost a year and when you do it 's about some bounty you 're after . Go to hell . Wait . Who did that to you ? It 's not really your problem is it ? That 's fair . Listen . I 'm working on something big . Real big . And when I 'm done the Union is gonna pay me enough gold prime so we can get the hell outta here and go wherever we wanna go . Dresher , I 'd really like to believe you , but you 're just like all the rest . You 're all promise . Nothing else . I don 't want this for you . I never did . Right now I need your help . You know everybody that comes through these parts . Who are you looking for ? This guy . The guy 's name is Anson . Has he been here ? Bout a week ago . He and his boys showed up drunk as hell . Beat on all the girls here . Paid well but they weren 't exactly worth the trouble . You 're telling me Anson did this ? No . Anson was strange but he wasn 't hostile . He spoke of things . Odd things . Something about going home . The guy gave me the creeps . He did his business and he left . So he um ... Yes , me and him cause that 's what I do remember ? I remember . Alright , I need to know where they were going . He said something about Maker 's Point . That 's all I know . Maker 's Point . That 's The Badlands . What the hell would he want there ? I don 't know and I don 't care . Well whaddya know . The bounty hunter returns . Hey you can have a shot at her , but I will be back later at night , so do yourself a favor . Don 't be here . Take it easy on her hot pants . Dresher , what you said about this being your last job and coming back for me , if you don 't come through you 're not welcome here anymore . You got a problem ? Yeah . I do . Don 't shoot . Don 't suppose you got any petrol ? Sorry hun . Fresh out . That 's too bad . Selling anything ? Got some water . Good . Purified . Seventy percent . You like gold ? You bet . Where you heading ? Maker 's Point . Hate to break it to you but life expectancy out there is slim to none . Hmmm . You a lawman ? Chaser . Second one I 've seen today . No shit ? Bought the last bit of my gasoline . Ma 'am . Hey , what about your bike ? Keep it . Is that you bounty hunter ? We know where you are now . I can send a couple of my boys out there and root you out . So I take it you 're Dresher . We picked up your scent fifty miles ago . You want a drink ? Call off your dogs Anson . I 'm taking you back to the Union . Piss off Dresher . Anson is mine . You chasers . Ya know you are all the same . Now let 's get down to it . Drop your gun or we 'll fill you full of holes . Once more , lose the piece . Shoot him . How much is the Union offering for my head ? I mean it 's gotta be a lot . Why else would you travel out to this little paradise ? It 's good enough . So you really believe these bureaucratic morons are gonna pay your freight don 't you ? Listen brother I don 't know you but based on your reputation I figured you for smarter than that . You do know me . I mean to me you 're just another human garbage collector doing a job nobody else wants to do . Which brings up an interesting question . Why do you do what you do ? Following some kind of code ? Is it revenge ? Redemption ? I like to see assholes like you get what 's coming to ' em . No you 're a pawn . That 's the truth of it . You 're a pawn taking orders from the same guys who created this mess . This beautiful cesspool we wake up to everyday . You 're fighting on the wrong side brother . It 's a on the losing cause , you don 't even know it . Why don 't you just cut him down . I swear , I won 't kill you . At least , not right now anyway . Counter offer . You both die . How about I string you up next to your buddy . Two noblemen side by side till the end . How 's that suit you ? Hang him . Those ropes ain 't gonna hold much longer . I know It 's not . What the hell were you thinking ? I was trying to save your ass . Giving up your weapons like that . Did Shamrock send you out here ? Of course he did . What do you think I 'm out here on vacation ? I 'm gonna kill that son of a bitch . No disrespect Dresher , but I don 't think you 're gonna get that chance . Don 't take this personal Dresher , but doing what we do , ya gotta look out for number one . So maybe I 'll see you again sometime . Maybe . Maybe not . Well ... Who are you ? How ya feeling ? Where am I ? You 're safe . You 're in a barn outside my home . I 'm Stillwell . Who 's this ? It 's okay . Kyra 's been watching over you . How long I 've been here ? Too long . You 've been here for several days . You 're wounds were extreme . All you need right now is rest . But you can 't do it here . Girl 's got a secret . Okay ... excuse us for a moment . Come here . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? He is a Union affiliated bounty hunter . I don 't think I have to tell you the kind of trouble he can bring down on us . We 're on our own out here and if we keep going the way we are we 're not gonna last . Now you know that and I know that . He could prove , useful . Now have I ever given you a reason not to trust me ? Why do you think he would wanna help us ? You 're up . What 's all this ? This is just salvaged computer parts . Much of it excavated from the prison mines . Some of it can be refurbished with work . I didn 't think any of this existed anymore . The Union might consider it contraband . Well the Union doesn 't have to know , do they ? I don 't know . Do they ? Take it easy friend . I 'm just a scavenger trying to survive just like everyone else . Some of these parts still fetch a price on the barter trades . Piracy . The Union definitely frowns on that . Why don 't you bring us in ? I 'm obliged for what you did for me so I guess I 'll collect my things and be on my way . You 're in no condition to move on . Now you stay right here with us . Come inside . I 'll bet you 're hungry . How long you been a chaser ? Umm ... long as I can remember . So you were chasing a bounty just before I found you . Who 're you after ? It 's a man by the name of John Anson . We 've heard of him . What 'd you hear ? I 've had a run in with a couple members of his gang , a while back . As far as I 'm concerned , he 's just another madman with a blood lust . He 'll get what 's coming to him . Yes he will . Must have a pretty big price on his head . It is all you chasers care about right ? The money . No the Union 's been trying to lock him up . I tracked him to Maker 's Point . Another chaser found him first . The Union . It 's funny isn 't it . Even in this climate politics remain and they expect law and order to exist . And what if it didn 't exist ? What then ? We 'll drive you to Grover Flats in the morning . I 'm sure you can find your way back to Union City from there . That 's a ... ghost town . Well , they prefer the Union to think of it that way . It 's getting late . The barn okay ? Yeah . I 'll see you at first light . What is it about you ? You don 't much care for my kind . Well I try not to care for a lot of things . But for some reason I do . I do too . A bounty hunter with a heart . You got me . What about you . There 's not much to tell . Just been trying to survive since the Drek Virus hit . What 'd you do before that ? It 's complicated . Usually is . Stillwell ? He was an accountant . And your father . That 's right . You know you 're lucky to have him . Most everyone else lost everything . I lost plenty . I used to believe in everyone and everything . I always saw the good no matter the circumstances . It 's funny my father still does . He believes in the end good still exists . He believes there still good people here too . And you don 't ? What 's your next move ? Get back on Anson 's trail . Why do you do this ? It 's a job . Hunting a man who left you to die sounds more serious than just a job . Well , see you around Union man . You looking for something pretty mister ? I 'm always looking for something pretty . That 's not why we 're here . Show her . Seen these two ? She doesn 't know . Now you boys can buy one of our girls , or you can head on down the road . You can die in about forty five seconds , and we 'll kill everyone in here . Or you can tell us what we wanna know . They live about twenty miles down the road . Go ahead . Take a look . Nice . Yeah , she 's vintage . It was here when we found the place . You know it 's ... well not exactly in the condition it is now . I took the liberty of making some modifications . Thrusters . Tracking wheels for almost any terrain . I believe you saw the solar fuel cell over there . Well I told you I 'm a scavenger . You know . And the extra parts come from the barter trades . Come on ! Well I guess I better take you into town now . Yes sir . You 're a good man , Stillwell I don 't suppose there 's any way we could talk you into sticking around for a while . Look , if you 're in any kind of trouble . No . No trouble at all . Take care out there . Hey Dresher . Get your man . I always do . Spirits ? Anything but Red Eye . Figures . How about Kentucky ? Three gold prime . Just pour the drink . I 'll also need vaccinations . You expecting to get the plague or something ? Actually I expect not to . What happened to you ? What do you care ? Call it a curiosity . Some men came in here earlier , looking for some girl . It was nothing . What girl ? They were creeps . Wonder what they want with Kyra and Stillwell anyway ? Forget it . Not our business . These men , who were they ? Never seen them before . They were wearing black sashes . Like they were part of some gang . This the guy ? No . But I wouldn 't mind having another go at those two . You got a car ? Got a bike . Why ? I need a ride . Hahahah . Forget it . Stillwell . You came back ! Take it easy . Take it easy . Lemme take a look . Listen to me . Listen . You 're gonna make it . You are . You 're a bad liar Dresher . Two men . Anson 's men . I know . No . No there 's more to this than you know . Kyra ... Where is she ? They took her . She has to survive . She must survive . She will . You promise me . You promise me . I promise . Stay with me Stillwell , stay with me . Stillwell . You 're a good man . He 's gone . Relax . I 'm no threat to you . I saw you in town . Who are you ? I 'm a finisher . There 's a lot more going on here that meets the eye Dresher . How do you know my name ? I know everything about you . Please . There 's no easy way to say this . I 'll just come out with it . I come from a different world , and I do mean a different world . Self aware technology . Riding black holes . Where death for me has no dominion . Let me put it this way . There are two worlds . Parallel . Occupying the same space . One , has unspeakable possibilities . Unlimited resources . Ruled by law . Clean air . We haven 't suffered the travesty . The shit that 's been wearing you down . Our experiment has paid off . What experiment ? Time travel . Time travel ? Yeah . It 's like riding a bucking Bronco . It threw us and landed us here . The time corresponded with the Earth we knew , but it wasn 't the world we knew . It was this world . Before the virus spread . Let me get this straight . You 're telling me that you came here from some sort of alternate universe ? And that this reality , right here , it 's not real ? Oh no it 's real . Through the looking glass mirror image where we 're sitting right now , reality is a by-product of free will . You try something , and sometimes the mistake are better than what you 're reaching for . It gave us a warning about the consequences of future actions . That we didn 't have to go through the economic collapse . The war . The Drek Virus . I 'm assuming you 're not out of your mind . Why are you here now ? Like I said , I 'm a finisher . The shit is about to hit the fan . Dire circumstances . Stillwell 's death has caused a tear . Tear in what ? In the fabric of time and space . Ah ! It 's a simple device . It 's how I got here . The man you 're tracking , Anson . He knows about this . He 's made a deal with certain parties to circumvent . How the hell would he know about this ? Because he 's from my world . When the borders were opened the doors got breached . Game on . They offered Anson safe passage back to home world , in exchange for Stillwell and the girl . I gotta get outta here . I shouldn 't even be talking to you . Another unbalanced action can cause a tear . We took a big chance bringing Anson and the Stillwells here . Your world has become a dumping ground for our garbage . You have to find her , alive or dead , and turn her over to me . Why would I do that ? It 's all about balance . I can make it worth your while . Nothing can make it worth my while . Nothing . Whaddya have to offer me ? Gold ? I don 't need it . I told you I know everything about you . You lie awake at night knowing something 's not right . You feel abandoned , because you are . Nothing is right because it 's not . You had a life in my world . You had a family . The hell are you talking about ? That 's what I 'm offering you . Answers . Try The Badlands . There 's nothing out there . Oh there 's something out there alright . How do I find you ? You don 't . I find you . Kyra , good morning . Been a long time . It 's funny thinking something so beautiful could exist in a world this ugly . Isn 't it boys ? Go to hell . I probably will . And I have to say , I 've missed all the sweet things you say to me . But you 've always had a lot of spirit . That 's why it 's always been hard for me to believe that , you 're truly you 're father 's daughter . Don 't talk about my father that way . You didn 't have to kill him John . Your father knew the risks . If he had truly loved you , he wouldn 't have gotten involved . So what now ? Kill me too ? I 'm not going to kill you Kyra . You are my ticket home . Oh I get it . They made a deal with you , didn 't they ? Well you can forget it . I would rather die than go back . I 've been on this rock for two and a half years pissing on the ground . Eating food animals would turn their heads at . I want out of here and you are going to be a good little girl until that happens . Understand ? I don 't want any trouble . These , are sacred lands I 'm a Union bounty hunter . No one crosses our borders , without a price . Take what you want . I got gold . Take him away ! Take point up on the roof . We expecting someone ? I 'm not taking any chances . So what 's your big plan ? Hand me over to Gargos ? No . But I 'm sure it 'd make him happy . You are the only woman that ever brought him to his knees right ? No my accord is with Washington . You are so blind . Do you honestly think Senator Allen is going to let you go home ? He will kill us both John . My deal with Senator Allen doesn 't end with you . So that 's your big price for freedom ? He 's going to chain you to a leash . Just keep you around till they do their dirty work . Somebody once told me , it 's better to be a slave in heaven than a king in hell . He was right . That doesn 't sound too good . What do you have ? Cancer ? Tuberculosis ? No , but it 's sweet of you to care . Get her inside . Why don 't you just call all this off before Gargos finds out . He will never stop hunting you . Why don 't you just stay here and die with a little dignity ? Get her inside . Ya alright ? You don 't have to worry about me Gulch . Is what she said true ? No . I 'm right as rain . Can 't you tell ? Sure about that ? Do your job . Yes sir . On your feet ! Welcome , to The Badlands . Bon a petit . Something funny ? Yeah . The fact that you two clowns think Anson 's actually gonna take you with him . She 's say anything to save her own ass . Maybe . Then again . What ? Am I supposed to take the word of a whore ? Anson told you how you was this Gargos fella 's personal little blow up doll . Well I guess the old saying really rings true . Once a whore , always a whore . Enjoy your grub . I killed it myself . Whatever it was . What is this ? You gonna tell me what 's going on ? The price of your freedom . I don 't understand . You 're gonna fight . AAAAGGGHHH ! Is that what you want ? Huh ! ? Is that what you want ? Huh ! ? Go . Union man . You come back here , I kill you myself . You 've got to be kidding me . Give me one good reason why I shouldn 't just kill you right now ? I don 't think you 're in any position to make threats , Dresher . You want Anson , you can have him . I don 't care . But right now I need your help . Are you with me ? Or should I just chop your head off ? I guess I 'm with you . Gotta say , never though I 'd see you again . We 've got an innocent girl up there . I need to get her out . Alright , what 's the plan . I need you to take the roof . I 'm going in through the front . What 're you gonna do , just walk up and knock ? You don 't know me . Let her go . Well , clearly I have underestimated you . I know what you 're doing . Well then you know I 'm not going to spend another day on this antediluvian world . I 'm not gonna let a primitive lawman stop me . Now we 've had this dance before . Drop your gun . We both know you 're not gonna kill her . You 're right . I 'm not . Why don 't you come take her . Just do what he says . Clearly I have underestimated you both . He 's all yours . Blade . Wait . Wait . Listen . Why don 't you come and work for me ? I 'll make you an offer you can 't refuse . I 've heard this one before . Let me see your hands , before I shoot them off . You haven 't heard my offer . Just get your hands up above your head . Your call . Son of a bitch . I never thought I 'd say this but it 's good to see you . Hold the applause . You said you knew what 's going on . How ? Someone from uh .. the alternate universe , world of yours , paid me a visit . Who ? I don 't know . Some shadow man . He almost split me in half . Wouldn 't give me his name . Said I just had to get you back . Must be from WITSEC . WITSEC ? It 's the Witness Protection Program run by the federal government on my world . My father was an accountant for the mob . The Gargos crime family . He found out that high-ranking politicians were taking money from Gargos to control hedge funds for future campaign funding . My father tried to blow the whistle but Gargos found out and he took me as payment for a crime against the family . Your father had to testify ? I wish I believed any of this . I didn 't believe it until they sent us here . A parallel world . Who would have thought , right ? - Alright asshole . - Hang on . I 'm gonna finish this . For my father . I needed him alive . Well this changes things . Nice shot . What are we doing here ? I need to take care of something . You 're so tense . Dresher . Dresher . This is amazing . I can see you , but I don 't see Anson . The mark has been eliminated . Where 's the body ? You came in here , without a body ? What am I supposed to tell the Union ? And what about the gold prime ? Forget about the gold prime . I learned a thing or two out there . What ? Nothing is as it seems . Nothing is ... You been hitting the Red Eye just a little bit too hard Dresher ? I 'm out . You have the balls to come into my house , empty handed , and then tell me that you 're done ? Listen to me very very carefully Dresher . I tell you when you 're done . No one disrespects me in my house , especially not you . I just did . What do you wanna do boss ? Teach him a lesson . An easy one . Yes sir . Go have a talk with him boys . I 'll check inside . We 'll bury him at dusk . They body 's gone . The whole place has been looted . I 'm sorry kid . You alright ? I always had this fear that I would lose my father to this place . Now it 's come true . He was right about one thing . What 's that ? There are good people here . What 's this ? Nothing I wasn 't expecting . Boys . You 've crossed the line this time . Been waiting a long time for this . So have I. Don 't do it . You killed her . That 's what I do . Why ? I 'm a spider , she was the fly . Nothing more , nothing less . You used me to get to her . You low life son of a bitch . How do you even know about me ? Well I feed on despair , Dresher . Well you found the right place . I owe you . No . I owe you . That would be the last thought you ever have . Your name is Dresher . Martin Dresher . You serve special ops during time breaches . You ran into your doppelganger this side of the fence . He was killed in the chaos . They couldn 't tell you apart , so they left you here ... Blank . The rest is on this . Who are you ? A finisher . What the hell is that ? They start it , I finish it . You think this world is bad ? It 's gonna get a whole lot worse . Some day our paths are going to cross again . I thought I told you to come alone ? Yeah right . I 'm not stupid . Like I 'm gonna be alone with you Senator ? You know , if anyone would see us talking ... Well , you couldn 't very well talk over the phone now could we ? What do you want ? Just thought you might like to know , that little problem that 's been keeping you up at night ... It 's been eradicated . Stillwell ? And the girl . Kyra 's dead ? I never understood your fascination with her . She betrayed you . Anson ? Anson failed me . I had to take matters into my own hands . So you brought in your finisher ? And he 's a colorful little character , isn 't he ? But he gets the job done . You . You went too far . Too far ? When you and your cronies came up with this little plan , I went along with it , because I had no choice . Falsifying witness protection records . Sending them into The Sector , so they wouldn 't be found . Safe you said . Safe it was . Clean , you said . Clean it was . But killing Kyra , that , that wasn 't part of the deal . Consider yourself lucky . It 's all to your benefit . You wouldn 't stand the indictment . At what cost . You 're obsessed with this parallel world and it 's going to be all of our undoing . Now suddenly you have a conscience ? You know yourself , this world has no more tolerance for criminals , the poor , the sick , none . Send them to The Sector . Free us of their burden . And what if the wormhole doesn 't hold ? Oh it 'll hold trust me . Once crime is down and jobs are up , we 'll be having this amusing conversation over dinner at the White House , pal . You really think you 're gonna be the President ? You sick , delusional , pathetic son of a bitch . You can forget about any more donations . I 'm off your payroll , and I 'm done with you . I don 't care what happens to me , but I 'm gonna blow the lid off this whole thing . You and this , is over . You understand ? Over ! You disappoint me . Well , worked out better than I thought . Alright Senator , I did my part . You know , you did the right thing . I guarantee you and your family will be safe from The Sector . I guarantee it . At least your family will be . Alright , Mister Dresher . Let 's see how far you 'll go to save your family . Your name is Dresher . Martin Dresher . They couldn 't tell you apart , so they left you here , blank . I was shown the truth that day . We live in a society of choice and free will . And free will , like anything bares consequence . It seems the government on alternate Earth has plans for us . They 're calling us The Sector . They plan to use our world as a prison , where they will exile violent criminals , do away with innocent lives that proves any threat , and bury their dirty secrets . My name is Martin Dresher . My wife and daughter think I 'm dead , but one day I 'll find my way back to them . The Finisher told me that our paths would cross again , and I 'll be ready when they do .

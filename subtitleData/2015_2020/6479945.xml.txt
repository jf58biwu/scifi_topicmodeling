Well , it is Friday , and for many of you , that means you have a fun and exciting weekend to look forward to , but I am working , and not that I don 't love what I do , but seeing as how it is " Full Disclosure Friday , " I am not really feeling it today . Oh , one cool thing , there was a report of a meteor touching down near Hadly Hill . And for those of you that don 't know Hadly , it 's what we like to call a starter hill . It 's not too challenging of a climb , but it 's a beautiful hike , it 's perfect for those of you that have small children with you . Um , just don 't get hit by any falling meteors . Um , now what some may not know about meteors , is that even though they look really bright and beautiful in the sky , what ends up touching down is usually not that much bigger than an acorn . So it 's kind of uneventful , for the most part , but it 's always fun to investigate . Ah , it 's already cold . That 's not good . And it is later than I thought . [ grunts ] God , I hate when that happens . Uh , okay ! This is Alice the park ranger , signing off . As always , leave comments below , click to subscribe to my channel . You guys know the drill .

So , uh , Duncan 's got something he wants to show you all . - You live ? - [ Trevor ] Locked and loaded . Got something I wanna show you . [ Trevor ] What 're you gonna show us with that old hunk of junk ? Well , most folks look at this , call it a scope . But after a few of my modifications , it is now known as the Duncan Harvey original . [ Trevor chuckles ] Shameless self-promoter ! You wanna see what it can do ? Yeah ! Why the hell not ? - That 's my mark . - Alright , that ain 't happening , guess it 'd have to be eyes on you . [ gunshot ] [ Trevor ] Well ? What , you missed ? [ Duncan coughs ] - How ' bout them apples ? - [ Trevor ] Shit ! No shit ! [ Trevor ] That 's more like ... 500 yards ! With this rig , I could make the same at six . [ Trevor chuckles ] Okay , alright , Duncan , you impressed me . - Damn right . - [ Trevor ] Well , but now how do I know you didn 't come out here and take that shot an hour ago ? Nah , I made it last night at ten yards , maybe twelve . [ Trevor ] Yeah , I believe that , I believe that . But seriously , that 's a bullseye at 450 yards . I wish I could take credit , but with this here hand-crafted , and fully patented , Harvey scope , hell , a brain dead stepchild could make that shot . [ Trevor laughs ] Hey , whoa , man ! [ Trevor ] What the hell ? Some kind of weird ass bullshit TV ... Okay . So you got the house and gate keys ? I think that should be it . You can call me on the cellular 'til we get to the high country . I got it . It 's no problem . - Guessing we 're all set then . - [ Trevor ] Daylight 's a burnin ' .

To further complicate things , I ... I feel terrible , and I-I can see that I look just as bad as I feel . I 've pretty much done as much as I can here by myself .

Oh , my God ! A trailer ! Hello ? Hello ! Someone there ? That 's weird . One moment I 'm hot . Another one , I 'm freezing cold . The clock on my phone says 4 : 45 , so just another hour or so until the sun should be start ... coming up .. I have no food and no water . I 'm so tired . I 'm so thirsty . It was ... It was more than three hours ago since I last saw Collin . I have this horrible feeling like maybe the sun will never come up , you know ? Whatever that thing was that attacked us ... Whatever ... I can 't ... I can 't ... God . My mind 's real foggy . It 's like I can 't remember what I was just thinking a second ago . Ryan ... Oh , Ryan ! I love you .

I wish I could explain what 's going on . I wish I know something ... I can 't , I can 't , I don 't know . [ eerie ambiance ] [ Trevor ] God said , " Let us make man in our image , after our likeness , and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth . " Alright , now . What I got to show you now is something truly illuminating . I know it don 't look like much , but this here is a blood trail . yeah , this here ain 't nothing good . Not natural . Not bright like it should be . It 's black . Like the blood from the heart , but even darker still . Dark blood of a dark prey . You bring hell to me , demon , and I 'll bring it right back at ya , you fucking night stalker . I can hear you breathe . I can hear your thoughts . I 'm inside you ! Look what we got here .

[ Trevor screaming in pain ] As you can see , the sun is finally up . I 'm so thirsty . [ coughs ] That was my first priority , gotta find some water . I gotta find a way back home .

You said you know something , you-you been somewhere . You know what 's been going on here . - You need to tell me ! - There was an accident . [ Holly ] What-What accident ? It wasn 't supposed to happen . None of this . [ Holly ] I ... I don 't understand . I 've seen things . They told me things . [ Holly ] What ... Who told you ? An accident . Like a nuclear meltdown of the cosmos , an outbreak . But it 's okay . I 'm safe now . [ Holly ] What ? How ? They can 't hurt me . But they can still hurt you . [ gunshots , Holly gasps ] [ Holly ] Gunshots ! They seem to be coming ... coming form there . Oh , my God , whoever it is , at least it 's human . Hello ? Hey !

What 're you lookin ' at me like that for , huh ? Huh ? ! Hell with you then . [ growling , Trevor screaming ] Doctor Margo Thompson here with a quick rundown of what we know . We 're still a long way from making sense of all this . I 'm sending everything to you on a coded frequency . Got multiple enemies ! [ gunfire ] [ indistinct commands ] With all the variables that we were dealing with here , it seemed that containment was our first priority . [ helicopter flying overhead ] What 's even more of a puzzle is our one known survivor . [ Dr. Thompson ] A man who , for unexplained reasons , has escaped contamination , physically at least . Psychological damage was extensive , which makes communication a real challenge . [ interviewer ] Today is Wednesday , the fifth of June , 2014 . I 'm here with Subject 31 , Collin Dean Barstow . Subject has been given 400 milligrams of Haldol to stabilize his behavior . He appears removed , but has been more responsive than in our previous attempts to conduct this interview . Mr. Barstow ? Collin ? I would really like you to tell me what you remember . What you remember ? [ interviewer ] Yes . What you remember ? [ interviewer ] Anything ? Anything at all ? Collin , I need to know what you saw . Under hypnosis , you mentioned to Dr. Brenner ... quite an amazing story . You told her that , after your friends and you were exposed , that you were taken captive . And that you were even able to establish a method of communication with those who abducted you . That you were taken out of the forest and onto some kind of craft . I said that ? [ interviewer ] I have a recording of it right here . What about these ? Collin , can you tell me about these drawings ? These symbols here ? My drawings ... [ interviewer ] Right . What do they mean to you ? Are they representative of something that you saw ? I 'm gonna play you something here , and I need you to tell me what it means . [ recorder clicks ] [ Holly on tape ] Please , Collin , you said you know something . You-You been somewhere . You know what 's been going on here . - You need to tell me ! - [ Collin on tape ] There was an accident . [ Holly on tape ] Wh-What accident ? [ Collin on tape ] It wasn 't supposed to happen . None of this . [ Holly on tape ] I ... I don 't understand . [ Collin on tape ] I 've seen things . They told me things . [ Holly on tape ] What ... Who told you ? [ Collin on tape ] And accident . Like a nuclear meltdown of the cosmos , an outbreak . But it 's okay . I 'm safe now . [ Holly ] What ? How ? They can 't hurt me . [ recorder clicks off ] [ interviewer ] Do you remember saying that ? Can you tell me what that means ? Why you ? What was it that made you safe ? Hey . Come on now . You gotta give me something here . They wanted to ... [ interviewer ] Go on . They wanted to try and find it . To stop it . [ interviewer ] Don 't stop , Collin . You 're doing great . Collin ? Come on . Come back to me , buddy . [ whispering ] Collin ? [ interviewer ] Let 's try something else . [ recorder clicks on ] [ Collin on tape ] Hey , Kimmy ! Time to wake up . Morning , baby . Morning , hey . What are you doing ? [ Collin ] I 'm watching you . Am I totally creeping you out or what ? Pervert . How long have you been filming me ? [ Collin ] I don 't know , 30 , 40 minutes ? Maybe less . - So creepy . - [ Collin ] Uh-huh . Hey , someone 's camera-shy . Come on , baby . Give it to me . [ Collin ] What ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Give it . [ recorder clicks off ] [ whispering ] Kimmy ... [ interviewer ] Yes , let 's start with Kimberly . What happened to her ? I know this is hard , Collin . It 's also really important that you tell me everything . I need you to remember . We need to go back to that place in the forest . Collin , what can you remember ? Everything . [ exhales ] Okay ... Hey , Kimmy ? Baby , can you come here for a sec ? - Yeah ? - Hey , sexy . Who me ? Yeah , you . Who else would I be talking about ? I don 't know , maybe one of those little freshmen that I always see you drooling over . Aw , what ? No . Come on , you ... They 've gotta know you give out extra credit - to the girl with the sweetest ass . - Whatever ! - Am I right ? - You 're crazy . Really ? Yeah , you 're crazy to think that I would ever be checking out any other girl . Oh , that 's weird . I 'm sorry . What now ? There 's something digging into my back . Ow . - Can you ... Can you reach around ... - What is it ? I don 't know what it is . It 's digging into me . Is it a freshman ? [ laughing ] I 'm serious ! I 'm serious ! It 's not . It 's weird . It 's weird ? Ow . And ... Oh , I think you found it . Wonder what that could be , huh ? Hey . Kim ? - Well ? - Well ? Come on , you 're killing me . This is how you ask ? Marry me . Can I take that as a yes ? Yes ! Yeah ? - I love you . - I love you , too . You wanna see some crazy shit ? I 'll show you some crazy shit . [ unearthly droning sound ] That 's some crazy shit . [ high-pitched tone ] ♪ ♪

 NARRATOR : Previously on Heroes Reborn ... Molly 's in here somewhere . ( GUNS COCK ) ( CLONES GRUNTS ) DEARING : Well , look what we got here . Run , Jose . Find your uncle ! ( EXCLAIMS ) ( TASER CLICKING ) TOMMY : Mom , it 's okay . ( WHIMPERS ) ( SIRENS APPROACHING ) Mom ? Why are we rounding up Evos ? To save our species . MOLLY : I can 't stop Erica , but I will not help her kill seven billion people . ( GASPS ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( ALARM SOUNDING ) ( ALARM CONTINUES ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER WALKIE-TALKIE ) What did Molly mean she wouldn 't help them kill seven billion people ? What the hell was she talking about ? I don 't know . We got to find out and there 's one person who has the answers . Your mother . You 've seen what she 's capable of . We 've got to stop her . I 've got an idea . This way . All right . ( TRUCK HORN BLARING ) MALINA : So , why are we in St. Pierre ? FARAH : Just a stop along the way . Along the way to where exactly ? Along your way . You 've seen the signs as clearly as I have . I know , my destiny . I get it . It 's not like I don 't know how important it is ... World-saving . I just don 't know how I 'm supposed to do it . I mean , I know a lot of things in theory , but ... When the moment comes , you will be ready . I promise . ( WHISPERS ) Come . I need you to stay here . I have to meet someone . Yeah , sure . And be vigilant about your powers . No slips . I promise . Good girl . ERICA : What are they doing here ? Some kind of scavenger hunt . Renautas publishes the " Evernow " game , so they 're taking photographs of themselves at different locations on the campus . A Japanese gamer named Ren Shimosawa set it up . The girls are dressed as ... Katana Girl . Hmm . Miko Otomo . This is a Trojan horse to get past security . She 's here for the sword . Get it out of here and to my house . I don 't need this . Without EPIC , we are falling behind . Although Molly 's download was incomplete , the EPIC units are still useful . Our operatives are using them now , and they 've been distributed to law enforcement . Great . The technology I 've spent a year and billions of dollars developing is only a partial success . ( SIGHS ) We can just arrest them all for trespassing . It 'll be easy to isolate them with the EPIC . No , these are our customers , and every single one of them has a cell phone with a camera . We spoil their fun , it goes viral in an instant . You do want the girl , though . I do . Send one of you to get them . Be discreet . And take care of Molly Walker 's body , please . HARRIS : I 've got the lab . This one will take the gate . ( CRUNCHES ) ( GATE BUZZER SOUNDS ) ( INCOHERENT YELLING ) It 's okay . Let ' em through . ( ALL CHEERING ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) FEMALE ANNOUNCER : ( OVER PA ) Remember , registration is the law . Failure to comply with registration procedures will result in severe measures and penalties . Help us keep everyone safe . It 's our shared duty . ( WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH OVER PA ) Wait . What is that ? MALE TECH : Tracking device with satellite uplink . Eye in the sky , so we always know where you are . It used to be the hand , but we put it here . ( GROANS ) MALE TECH : Wouldn 't want to nick an artery . You have an allowed radius . Breach it , an alarm 's triggered . Response time is less than 10 minutes . Who responds ? You don 't want to find out . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) I think we need to give her a name . ( SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE ) Jose ! NOAH : What is this ? Brassica oleracea . Glycine max pasanaca . Crispum ... This is Latin . It 's genus species names . These are seeds . NOAH : A seed bank ... A very , very large seed bank ... The kind you build when you 're planning to repopulate . " Repopulate " ? After an extinction . Aw , man ! You and Molly were right . I have no idea what my mother 's up to . Let 's speculate later . ( DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS ) We need to vamoose before we 're jacked into one of those crazy-ass pods . Come on . MAN : 672 , Renkert ? That 's it ... 672 . ( WHISPERS ) They 're loading them for transport . To where ? NOAH : That might be a good question for your mother , Taylor . ( SIGHS ) Evil bitch . ( CHUCKLES ) Evil bitch or not , you 're about to mend fences with her . Joanne ? Hello ? ( SIGHS ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( SIGHS ) ( CELL PHONE DIALING ) Caspar , it 's Farah , again . We 've been here for hours . Our contact hasn 't shown up . Call me . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) ( EVO MARKER BEEPS ) ( POWERING UP ) ( PROCESSING ) She 's headed east . ( CHATTERING ) ( EVO MARKER BEEPS , POWERING UP ) ( CONVERSING IN JAPANESE ) ( CLICK ) DENNIS : ( RECORDED VOICE ) You 're the best daddy in the whole world . I love you , Daddy . FEMALE ANNOUNCER : ( OVER PA ) Remember , registration is the law . So what are you running from , Tommy ? ( CHEWING ) Should I call you Kevin ? Or Michael ? Or Justin ? Five aliases , that 's got to be a record for someone your age . So , I 'm gonna ask you again . What are you and your mother running from ? You and people like you . People like me need laws to protect us from people like you . That 's what the Odessa Protocol 's all about . Wait. ls that what 's gonna happen to me ? Am I gonna disappear like the other ... What about my mom ? I don 't know what 's gonna happen until we get a few things cleared , so why don 't we start with you telling me your real name ? ( SIGHS ) It 's Tommy . The others were fake . Your last name ? Clark . AGENT CUTLER : Your real last name . The one you had before you were adopted . Unless you were adopted when you were an infant and you don 't remember . No , I 'm not adopted . AGENT CUTLER : Your blood type is AB , your mother 's is O-negative , so , biologically speaking , there 's no way that could happen ... What about my father ? No matter what blood type your father had . Anne Clark isn 't your birth mother . So we need to find your birth parents , in case they 're unregistered as well . Meantime , lam logging your abilities and your tracking number . You 're required to report any changes in your teleportation power or if you develop any new abilities . ( CELL PHONE DIALING ) He 's gone . ( SIGHS ) Lock down the hospital . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) Penny for your thoughts , Agent Cutler . ( FOOTSTEPS ) ( FARAH PANTING ) What is it ? What 's wrong ? We were supposed to meet someone , and I 'm pretty sure I had a tail . I think you still do . What 's happening ? Who are they ? HARRIS CLONE : Where is it ? Where 's the baby ? ( EVO MARKER PROCESSING ) I 'm afraid your powers can 't hide you anymore . The next one won 't miss . Farah ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( WIND WHOOSHING ) ( BOTH GROANING ) Malina , chalo . Chalo ! ( SIREN WAILING ) I want to see Detective Dearing . Something he 's investigating ? No , something he committed . My nephew Jose , he 's 12 years old and Father Mauricio from Saint Francis , they 're both missing . And they were at my family 's auto shop . Dearing knows where they are . Kidnapping 's a pretty serious charge . Yes , it is . So , like I said , if I could talk to him ... Wait right here . Guy out front here says you might know something about a kidnapping . A couple people disappeared from an auto shop on Las Flores . Really ? Doesn 't ring a bell . Have him take a seat . I 'll be there in a minute . Hey , Dearing , check this out . These new EPIC things finally showed up . Do you really think these things can tell you if there 's an Evo in the room ? ( EVO MARKER BEEPS , POWERING UP ) Where you going , boss ? ( EVO MARKER BEEPS , POWERING UP ) I left my phone in the car . ( EVO MARKER PROCESSING ) ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( GROANS ) Whoa , whoa , whoa . Back off . We 'll handle this . Get back to work . ( GRUNTING ) You should have told us , man . You know what we have to do to you now . Let 's get him up . Get up . ( GRUNTING ) ( DEVICE BEEPING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( DEVICE BEEPS ) Let 's get ready . Erica . Great . We 're almost ready for you . Thank you , Richard . Everything okay ? Fine , yes . Family stuff . You have a daughter , don 't you ? I do , but she 's six , so she thinks I 'm a god . ( CHUCKLES ) Maybe she 's right . What you 're doing is godlike . The next Big Bang without the noise or the mess . You ready ? All clear . ( MACHINE BUZZING ) ( MACHINE POWERING UP ) Phenomenal . Hmm . It is just phenomenal , Richard . We 've built an entire company based on mining the power of Evos , but this ... This one 's power is by far the most important . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Excuse me . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) TAYLOR : ( ON PHONE ) ( SOBBING ) Mom . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean for it to go that far . I was just trying to get back at you because of Francis . I know it was childish of me . Yes , it was . TAYLOR : Can we talk ? Please ? Face-to-face ? Where are you , Taylor ? TAYLOR " . At the house . I just really need to talk . I 'll meet you there . ( SNIFFLES ) ( PHONE BEEPS ) I 've always been an excellent fake crier . ( SIGHS ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( EVO MARKER BEEPS , POWERING UP ) ( EVO MARKER PROCESSING ) ( PROCESSING CONTINUES ) ( PANTING ) ( CONVERSING IN JAPANESE ) ( PANTING ) Hey , what the hell ? We paid our rent . I don 't rent to Evos . You can 't just throw us out . You didn 't register , and that 's grounds for eviction . You 've got 30 days to comply . I don 't see them . Them who ? Who were those people ? Renautas . MALINA : Who 's that ? FARAH : A corporation hell-bent on making sure you don 't complete your mission . MALINA : A corporation ? How did they find us ? I don 't know , but I think those glasses he was wearing can see our powers . ( SIGHS ) Malina ... You don 't have to save the world alone , but if those men catch us ... Come on . ( THROUGH SPEAKERS ) All right , so the trick here . ( LAUGHS ) The trick here is that you don 't want to use too much glue , all right , buddy ? Now , we 're just gonna use a little dab around the edges and on the bottom , just like so . Then you just ... JOANNE : ( GASPS ) ( WHISPERS ) Exciting moment . Set it in . Voila , nice and easy . ( SNIFFLES ) Okay ? Got it ? Yeah . I think he 's got it , babe . He 's got it . JOANNE " . Yay . All right , Captain , you want to see if she 's seaworthy ? Yeah . One , two , three , let her rip . Yeah ! Come on , buddy . We built that . Yeah . We did that . ( CELLPHONE KEYPAD BEEPING ) ( RING TONE ) ( LINE CLICKS ) ( SOBS ) Hey , Marcy , it 's Luke . Um ... ( SNIFFLES ) I need to see Don right away . ( RING TONE ) Damn it . ( CELLPHONE BEEPS ) ls anyone coming to meet us ? Run . Chalo . Chalo ! ( PANTING ) We can 't keep running . I can stop them . It 's not working ! I can 't use my powers . Get to the back . Get to the back ! ( SHOUTS ) Oh , my God , no . ( GRUNTS ) Oh ! I can 't . Go , just go . I 'm not leaving you . When the time comes , you will know what to do . The answers you need are in this envelope . Run.Run ! ( GROANS ) ( ENGINE RUMBLING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( GRUNTING ) Tommy ! Oh , my gosh ! You 're okay . It 's all gonna be okay . No , it 's not gonna be okay . It 's never going to be okay . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) It really doesn 't matter . That 's not the problem . What is it ? She 's not my mom . What ? My mom , she 's not my mom ! Our blood types don 't match , and I didn 't even know , and I 've got all these different names , and I don 't even know if mine is real . Lots of people are adopted . I mean , it 's not okay that your mom didn 't tell you . Being adopted isn 't any big deal . People are test-tube babies and surrogate babies . She lied to me ... About everything . I don 't even know who I am . You 've got to talk to her , give her a chance to explain . ( BOTH PANTING ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( GASPS ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( CONTINUE CONVERSING IN JAPANESE ) ( COMPUTER PROCESSING ) ( PINGING ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) ( GROANS ) ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) What the hell 's going on ? We got a problem down here . ( BANGING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( TIRES SCREECH ) ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( CHOKING ) What the hell are you doing here ? You took my friends . Loan leave you here and let your men tear you apart , or ... You take me to where they are . Okay , okay . Yeah . Really ? ( GROANS ) Really . ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( ENGINE ROARING ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( GUNSHOTS ) ( DOOR SECURITY DEVICE BEEPS ) Sorry I interrupted your day . It seems that you are always sorry for something . Tell me why you went behind my back . I just wanted answers . But you didn 't trust me to give them to you ? It 's not about trust . It 's just , whenever I ask you a question , all I wind up with is more questions . This whole thing is about your friend , Francis ? We were more than friends , and I asked you if you killed him . Which was utterly ridiculous . Maybe , but you didn 't tell me what you did do with him . You didn 't tell me he was locked in the basement , wired up in some kind of pod , along with all those other Evos . Francis knew exactly what he was getting into when he came to work for Renautas . He believes in what we 're doing . What exactly is that , Mother ? Saving the future that we 've squandered , and that requires sacrifice . Molly Walker ... Did she understand about sacrifice , too ? Is that why she blew her brains out ? I cannot talk to you when you are like this . You are being delusional and paranoid . ( CHUCKLES ) It 's happening again , isn 't it ? You 're using . I 'm not using . Don 't try to blame this on me . We have been down this road , Taylor . I know the signs . Mom , I 'm not using ! That 's exactly what a junkie would say . I 'm sorry , but I don 't believe you . NOAH : I do . Long time , Erica . So dramatic , Noah . You could have just knocked . And you ... You broke my heart . I 'm not so sure you have one anymore . Where 's my sister ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . " I have no idea what you 're talking about . " Okay , all right . Why don 't you two give me a minute with her ? Come on , Erica , let 's take a walk . ERICA : It 's hard to believe it 's only been a year since we 've worked together . When Renautas took over Primatech , I considered you one of my greatest assets . Who could have imagined this scenario ? What is on your mind , Noah ? Did you kill my daughter ? I had nothing to do with Claire 's death . And Hiro Nakamura ? He died at the Summit with all the rest . You can blame Mohinder Suresh for that . And Molly Walker . You gonna stand there and claim that her blood is not on your hands ? Molly Walker was part of something larger than herself . She just couldn 't get past her own selfishness and fear . What is so big and so important that it is worth Molly 's life and the lives of all those other people you have locked up in that basement ? Us , Noah . This planet . There is no cost too high . Including murder ? ( CHUCKLES ) That 's what 's wrong with you . You grew soft , and like most of humanity , you are not willing to do what 's necessary , but I am . lam giving us a future . Somebody has to . NOAH : How exactly does this work , this big sacrifice of yours ? ERICA : Why should I tell you ? You 're the one who chose to forget , who chose to wipe his own memory , all to protect ... What ... What ? To protect what ? ( CHUCKLES ) You mean " who , " don 't you ? I 'm tired of this game . I want answers ! You can put the gun down now . Thank you , Harris . Your errand was certainly timely . His friends are in the kitchen . Not a problem . I brought company . ( DOORBELL RINGS ) ( PANTING ) Luke . Marcy told me it was an emergency . I came as soon as I could . Uh , come in . Can I get you a drink or something ? No , no . No , I 'm ... I 'm fine . Why am I here , Luke ? I got patients waiting . How much will you pay me for my share of the practice , Don ? Don 't think about it . Just tell me . Look , I 'm gonna head back to the office , all right ? We can talk about this in the morning . Do you want the practice ? If you asked me a year ago ... Do you want the practice , Don ? Yeah . That 's great . ( INHALES DEEPLY ) Just , uh ... Just write me a check . You making a change or just retiring ? Atoning . Richard called . He says it 's important . Please . Everything is important to Richard , how many loads we can transfer per day , how he takes his coffee . Fine . What is it this time ? I don 't know . We 'll go see him when we 're done here . You 're not getting away with this . Everybody 's gonna know ... ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANING ) What would you like to do with them ? ( DRAMATIC MUSIC ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) Give me the sword , now . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) You got this ? Yeah . ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( DOOR SLIDES CLOSE ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( CHUCKLES ) Arigato . Yes ! ( EKG BEEPING ) Tommy . ( SIGHS ) Thank God you 're all right . What did they do to you ? What did you tell them ? What did I tell them ? I don 't know , Mom . What could I tell them ? Not the truth , ' cause I don 't know the truth , do I ? You lied to me . You 've always lied to me . Nathan ... Nathan ? Is that even my name , who I am ? Where did I come from ? You are my son . No matter what name we are using , you have always been my son . I wanted to tell you . I did ... But there just never seemed to be a good time . But I will tell you everything . CASPAR : Everything , Anne ? You really ready to tell him everything ? ( DRAMATIC MUSIC ) NOAH : I lost them . There must be a secret exit , like a tunnel or something . Where is my sister , Phoebe Frady ? Oh , easy , easy . That 's enough . Are you kidding me ? Are you kidding me , man ? We got him right where we want him . ( CHUCKLES ) We could beat the answers out of him if we want to , but now you want to wuss out on me ? ( GUN COCKS ) Where is my sister ? Quentin , that 's enough . You know him and you didn 't tell me ? Of course your mother knows me . I 've been around for a while . How long ? Over a year now . A Year ? ( STAMMERS ) Wait . Are you my dad ? No . He 's not your dad . Then why have you been following me for ... For a year ? ( SIGHS ) Because you 're that important , Tommy , very important . I couldn 't tell you . I had to take you away before you found out , 'cause I was afraid that when you found out , you ... You would try to save your dad . I couldn 't lose you both . ( SIGHS ) You shouldn 't have run . Then this wouldn 't have happened . What do you want with me ? Why am I so important ? You have a destiny . Humanity has one last hope for survival , and part of it rests on your shoulders . What does that even mean ? ( SIGHS ) You 're going to help save the world . No . I 'm not . ( SOBBING ) ( PANTING ) ( SMOKE ALARM BEEPING ) ( SMOKE ALARM BLARING ) ( ENGINE WHIRRING ) Erica , thank God . Are you okay ? ERICA : Of course . Just a minor inconvenience . I 'm afraid Mr. Harris here underestimated the situation , but I 'm sure he won 't do it again . Right . Well , the reason I called , things are happening much more quickly than we anticipated . How quickly ? Less than a week . Have you run the simulation ? Yes , that 's what I needed you to see . With the magnetic poles reversing , we are going to be defenseless against solar radiation . A coronal mass ejection unlike anything the world has ever seen is headed our way . We 're talking total devastation , 96 % of all species on Earth wiped out in a matter of days . It 's worse than we ever expected . What did you expect , Richard ? Starting over is never pretty . ( SCORCHING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING )

 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... What is this place ? It 's a safe house for people with powers . Simmons has been working around the clock on these . So these take my powers away ? Are there side effects ? Afew . Bobbi and I work for an organization that came out of the wreckage from what Fury left . Who the hell are you working for ? The real S.H.I.E.L.D. There 's nowhere to go ! It appears Hunter escaped using one of the ship 's submersible pods . I know Coulson . His behavior 's grown increasingly more troubling . Coulson and his secrets , that 's the threat . And I think it 's time that we remove that threat . I want to go back in . Today , world leaders are scrambling for answers after S.H.I.E.L.D. was crippled by a series of devastating attacks . No one seems to be sure how long the terrorist group known as HYDRA has been operating within S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s ranks , but today they made their presence known when they destroyed ... I can 't feel my arm , Mack . I can 't feel it . Tim , I 'm gonna need you to trust me now , buddy . It 's gonna be okay . Once affiliated with the Nazi party ... Always with the Nazi stuff . Now , which one of you is the Chief Engineer ? I ask one more time and then I start shooting . Who is this ship 's Chief Engineer ? It 's me . I 'm ... I 'm Chief ... No ! No ! No , he 's lying to protect me . I 'm the one you 're looking for . No ! Tim ! No ! No ! I don 't like liars . So , with that in mind , where are the ship 's schematics ? Get down ! That man just died because of you . How many more you want on your conscience today , huh ? What the hell is that ? Watch out ! Watch out ! Weapons down . Gotta get you a gun one of these days . Saving my bullets for the real fight . - You all right ? - Yeah . What is that thing ? My phone . Needed a distraction , and we used all of our other gadgets getting into the ship . HYDRA 's everywhere , Mack . Hey , this isn 't over yet . Okay . Time to get moving . What 's the plan ? What are you even doing here ? Fury left us orders . To do what ? To save S.H.I.E.L.D. Sir , I 've gotta say , this is quite an honor . I know how much Lola means to you . Figured you earned a peek under the hood . But not without supervision . Of course not . Wouldn 't have it any other way . Sir , no sign of Hunter . He must 've taken off right after Mack saw him . Guess you were right . Permanence isn 't his thing . I believe any reservations that he has are about me , not S.H.I.E.L.D. Honestly , I let things get out of hand between the two of us . - I take full ... - Don 't . Hunter 's not your responsibility . He 's my agent . That 's why I 've put out feelers of my own . We 'll see soon enough where he stands . Well , let me know if there 's anything I can do to help . The path we 've chosen doesn 't leave a lot of room for trust , does it ? It 's a little weird here , but I 'm settling in . I 've played a couple dozen games of Solitaire . It 's a lonely game , that Solitaire . Well , May will head there soon . So don 't give up on Solitaire just yet . And who do I have to thank for the Little Debbie Snack Cakes ? That was Coulson 's idea . But I did pick you out some nice gluten-free biscuits . Ah ! Yeah , I 'll ... I 'll look for those . Have you tried on the gloves yet ? I have not . But I will . Well , when you 're feeling up to it , it might be worth giving them a go . They 're obviously just a prototype , but they 're laced with a micro-thread I designed , which should accelerate your healing and dampen the vibrations . I just want you to be safe , Skye . You know that , right ? I do . It means a lot , Jemma . Thank you . Okay then . Call me if you need anything . I will . Bye . How 's your science experiment going ? I told you , Leo , I 'm only trying to help . Whatever , Jemma . It 's not the first time you 've taken a look under Lola 's hood , is it ? That toy car you gave me , it 's a perfect replica . Well , almost perfect . It doesn 't fly yet , sir , but I promise you , I 'm working on it . That was unfortunate . But that 's not what I 'm talking about . Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm not following . Yes , you are . I know Lola like the back of my hand , so it wasn 't too hard to find once I went looking . I still haven 't figured out what that component you put in there does , but I 'm having Fitz take a look now . You could save everyone a lot of trouble by just telling me what it is you 're after . You went through rigorous testing when you joined my team . Help me remember , what did you say when I asked if you were loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. ? I said I was , because I am . And that 's the truth , sir . Look , you 've always been brutally honest with me , and I value that . So I 'm giving you a chance here , just tell me who you 're working for . I work for S.H.I.E.L.D. So , you wanna do this the other way ? Okay then . I 've lost too many friends to HYDRA . So have I. You 're not in this alone , I know that much . Are you working with Hunter ? Or is he just a pawn in this , too ? Oh , God ! Get May on the line ! Now ! I told Coulson there was no way . I hate being wrong . Please , okay ? There 's no need for the gun . I can explain . Can 't wait . I work for S.H.I.E.L.D. I do . I swear . But you don 't . Try again . What Coulson 's doing here , this isn 't S.H.I.E.L.D. Not the real S.H.I.E.L.D. anyway . The last person who betrayed me , I broke his larynx . Hand that over . May , it doesn 't have to be like this . I didn 't want this . Damn it ! - You three , find him . - Yes , sir . The rest of you , follow me . Right , let 's go . It 's us . Found Fitz . Talk to me . It 's Bobbi . She set off some kind of EMP . She 's gone . Mack too . He embedded a scanner into Little Lola 's engine . It was programmed to find anything with Vibranium . That 's how Bobbi knew where to look . She has Fury 's Toolbox . Go . Find her . We can 't let them escape . We won 't . I 'll make my way to the Server Room and initiate a manual lockdown . They know all of our protocols . We handed Mack the schematics of our base . They don 't know everything about this place . Not like we do . She said she was working for S.H.I.E.L.D. , Phil . The real S.H.I.E.L.D. What the hell does that mean ? We 're running out of time , Mack . I need to find him . Conference room is up ahead . If he 's not there ... Commander Gonzales , wait . - We 're not HYDRA . - I 've heard that before . I 'm Agent Bobbi Morse . We 're here under Fury 's orders , protocol A-S-T-A-0-6 . Thank God . It 's been a bastard of a day . Sir , our mission is to get you off the ship . That man there had an ax . Now I have it . Still left quite a mark . Agent Morse ... Coulson and May knew something was up . I had to go to plan B. What about Mack ? Unclear . But I have the Toolbox . Good work . Any word on Hunter ? We 're still trying to track the evac pod . No luck yet . Have you found the girl 's location ? No , but if Coulson knew something was up , he probably took Skye somewhere far away from here . Whoa ... Hello , this is Jemma Simmons . Please leave a message . Hey , Jemma , it 's me . Um , can you call me back ? I put the gloves on , but are they supposed to make you feel woozy ? Maybe that 's just a side effect . Also , are they supposed be this tight ? I 'm not complaining , I 'm just wondering . Anyway , call me back when you can . Okay , bye . Whoa . Oh , Fitz , why did you make me watch Paranormal Activity ? Hello , Skye , I 'm Gordon . May I come in ? So , what is the plan with that ? You ... - You can see ? - Hmm ... Not the way you do , but I can see that you 're afraid . You don 't need to be . Not with me . - Who are you ? - I 'm like you . And I 've come here as a friend . I can 't imagine how it must 've felt to go through your transformation without any understanding of what to expect . I had years to prepare , and still ... I was horrified by what I became . Granted , I was younger . May I sit ? This couch is very uncomfortable . I wish you wouldn 't stare . - Uh ... - That was a joke . I 'm not very good at them . I don 't mind that you 're curious , honestly . And , yes , I used to have eyes . They were blue . This ... This was the obvious change for me . But what happens inside can be just as profound . You see , the Mist changes everyone differently . The real difference between the two of us is what happened after we went through the Mist . What do you mean ? I knew from an early age how special I was . I had a mentor . A guide of sorts . And the first thing she did after I transformed was embrace me . Tell me , Skye , what was the first thing that S.H.I.E.L.D. did to you ? Stay together . Bobbi ! Thank God , it 's you . I couldn 't find anyone . Me neither . But we 'll be safer now that we 're together . Right . Good . So what 's next ? Found my three agents . Let me guess . Unconscious ? Mack took them out , then disabled the bus . Any luck on the Quinjet ? Engine line 's shot . Looks like they don 't wanna be followed . They 're not killing anyone . Is this you looking at the bright side ? HYDRA leaves bodies behind . Honestly , I don 't give a damn who they 're working for . They took Fury 's Toolbox . I bet that 's not the only thing they 're after . What does it feel like ? Your gift ? I don 't know . Um ... It 's intense . Like 1,000 bees are trapped inside of me , and I feel it all the time . It 's always there . I can 't stop it . Why would you wanna stop it ? Because I destroy everything around me . That is simply not true . Every object in this universe gives off a vibration , did you know that ? Nothing rests . Animals , trees , people , even this ratty couch . And you , you have the ability to tap into those vibrations . Don 't you see ? You could become magnificent . But something 's inhibiting you , constraining your energy . Uh ... No . No , no , my , um , friend 's a scientist . She made these to protect me . Or do they protect people from you ? No , it 's not like that . My powers , I ... I can 't control them . And when I try to , it hurts me . Most gifts come with a price . But you could learn to manage it . I apologize . I 'm saying too much . This is probably not the best place to continue our conversation . You don 't have the tools or the understanding that you need just yet . To do what ? To be who you were always meant to be . Without fear . Without pain . We can offer that to you . How ? I 'll take you to a place where you can be with people like us . Us ? How many are there ? You can learn about yourself , your gift . You can be safe . But only if you wanna come . When you 're ready , I 'll find you . - How will you find me ? - Trust me . I 'll know . You know , we really should get going . Yes , I know , but it 's in here somewhere . See , I don 't think an EMP hit our base . When those occur , the pulse typically wipes out any electronic device that 's powered up . But anything that was off remains functional . Here , take this . But something different is happening now . I think whoever did this set up a ghost interface that 's overriding our system directly . If I could just find this prototype ... You know what ? Maybe Fitz has it . We should go try to find him . Make sure he 's okay . Oh ! Here we go ! What ... Coulson , May , I 've got her . Why is that not working ? There 's something else . Two down . What the hell is that ? Fitz , don 't ! Mack . I 'm not gonna hurt you , buddy . I would never hurt you . You know that . I just need you to trust me right now . Please . When I was a kid , I had this coin collection . But , one day , I couldn 't find it . I got so mad I punched the floor . And it felt good at the time . And then a week later my hand turned black and blue . It was swollen out to here . I almost lost it . It turns out , I broke my fifth metacarpal . Had no idea . They call it a Boxer 's Break . You getting ready for a point here , Chief ? Yeah . The most dangerous kind of pain is the kind you can 't feel . I got you , sir . I got you . Not much of a trainee anymore . Okay , guys , we gotta move . HYDRA 's closing in on both sides . His leg 's bad . Think you can clear a path to the top deck and ready the chopper ? An opportunity to kill more of these bastards ? I love your whole thing , you know that ? Hold out for them as long as you can . They 'll be right behind you . And , um , do you mind ... Could you give this to Hunter ? Bobbi ... He 's gonna be pissed , you know that ? Yeah . Hartley 's gonna clear a path . You think you can carry Gonzales to the top deck ? Yeah . What about you ? I 'll meet you up there . What are you talking about ? Fury gave me a second mission . I need to get to the Server Core . Once you get Gonzales off this ship , I 'm gonna sink it . What the hell are you talking about ? That disk will detonate every weapon on this ship . There 's no way you will make it out before you 're 80 feet underwater . Why would the Director do this ? Because of what 's on this ship . We 're carrying a cargo that we can 't let HYDRA get their hands on . That 's why I can 't let you waste your time or your resources trying to get me off of this ship when it 's in play . I 'm coming with you . Sir , all due respect , my orders are clear . The Server Core 's back at the Operations Center . Do you know how many HYDRA agents there 's got to be between here and there now ? - Mack ... - Look , you wanna get this job done , you 're gonna need all the help you can get . I signed up for this . No one else . Stop being so damn stubborn , Barbara . You don 't need to do this one alone . He 's right . God help us , I 'm still the Commander of this ship , Agent Morse . Which means you have new orders . We 're gonna help you finish this job . What is that ? It 's a gift from Fury . A means to rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D. What do you plan to do with her , sir ? That might depend on what she was planning to do with us . Hopefully May will have some answers soon . They 're not trying to get out . Don 't ... I need you to get away from that wall right now . Stay back . Stay back . Fitz , you don 't understand . Fitz ! Fitz ! Fitz ! Mack needs medical . Right away , sir . - You think HYDRA destroyed the wall ? - What wall ? Back at the Academy . For fallen S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . I 'm not sure . Sorry about Tim . Stay back . It 's heavier than I thought . Yeah , right ? What are you doing back here ? A few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents have gotten hold of the turret on the top deck . They were fighting back , so I thought why the hell not . It 's ours now . Wait . S.H.I.E.L.D. has the top deck ? And I heard from Vic . She 's gonna hold The Hub . Bobbi , what if we can take back the ship ? There 's still 14 more decks , and we 're outnumbered 3-to-1 . The ship is already lost . And if we want S.H.I.E.L.D. to survive ... We need to push on . We 're running out of time . There 'll be time to explain everything to him . And if he 's as good a man as you say , he 'll understand . Still no sign of May ? We 'll find her . Agent Mackenzie 's stabilized . - Any others injured ? - None . I 'd like to officially withdraw my concerns about using the dendrotoxin gas . It 's got style . If only someone were taking minutes . Where do we stand with Agent Skye ? Our techs found the Quinjet 's flight recorder . Looks like Coulson took her to , uh , The Retreat . Really ? Bold , taking her to the house that Banner built . That 's why I 'd like to take a team of tactical agents and retrieve her . Sends a pretty aggressive message , don 't you think ? Skye doesn 't mean anyone harm . It doesn 't mean she can 't harm anyone . If Coulson put her at The Retreat , he thinks she 's dangerous , too . Then I 'd like to join . A familiar face couldn 't hurt . I 'll update Agent Oliver with our status . Good . We 'll be in touch . Yeah , I 've got it . Agent Weaver . It 's been a while . - You 're working with them ? - I could ask the same about you . I went to the Academy to look for you , but you weren 't there . We didn 't even know if you were alive . If it weren 't for Agent Calderon , I wouldn 't be . He co-opted a squadron of Quinjets to come to the Academy . He saved us . If it weren 't for him , we would 've lost even more young , talented minds that day . - Then why are you ... - Why are you betraying S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Phil Coulson has no right to call this S.H.I.E.L.D. We obviously have a lot to discuss , but right now , I need your help , Jemma . Agent Mackenzie 's injuries have stabilized , but I need you to take a look , see if we missed anything . There are few whose opinion I value more , and we could use your expertise . Wait outside . Nice office . Lots of light . You haven 't even delved into the record collection . I have no plans of moving in . - You may not know who I am , but I ... - Oh , no . I actually know quite a bit about you , Robert . You started in S.H.I.E.L.D. young , like me . Dropped out for a while when your wife passed , but then came back with a vengeance . Rose to command the Iliad three years later . And by all accounts , became one of the best Commanders S.H.I.E.L.D. ever had . I know this because I spent months searching for you when S.H.I.E.L.D. fell . Because I 'd heard you were a good man . 'Cause I wanted you on my team . I wish I could say the same . I wish you were the man you were even two years ago . But by all accounts , you 're not . You didn 't know me then , and you don 't know me now . I know that Fury brought you back from the dead . Right . I didn 't ask for that , but I 've come to appreciate the gesture . That he filled your veins with alien blood . God knows what that did . Weaver thinks it made you into some kind of a messenger for an alien race . Can you say with certainty that that 's not true ? And we haven 't even begun to talk about your protégé , Skye . You two have a lot in common . At least you once did . What happened in the alien city , Phil ? You say that you 're the Director . So did she drag you down there kicking and screaming , or were you curious ? I went to Puerto Rico to destroy the alien city and stop Dr. Whitehall . And that 's what we did . In part , that 's true . And that 's why I wanna give you a chance . To be the good man I know you once were . We believe that Fury kept a lot of what he did from the World Council . That he had objects and people of terrifying power hidden across the globe . We wanna find them . And we wanna make sure that they don 't destroy the very world that we fight so hard to keep safe . Show me how to open it . - Hello ? - Skye . May , what 's happening ? I couldn 't connect to you guys . You need to get out of there . Now . What ? Why ? What 're you talking about ? There 's a panel on the southwest corner of the compound . It 'll let you bring down the laser grid fence . May , stop . You can do this , Skye . I believe in you . But you need to run . Now . They 're coming for you . - Who ? Who 's coming for me ? Who ... - S.H.I.E.L.D. May ? May ? Oh , my God ! Do not approach the target alone . You see her , you send up a flare . Remember , Skye 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent like one of us . ICERs only . Come on , move ! Mack ! - Where 's the Server Core ? - Behind here . Take that exit . Same deal as before . Get everyone you can off the boat . I 'll wait to blow the ship as long as possible . What about the agents we don 't find ? They 're out there fighting , dying right now to take back this ship . You 're just gonna blow them to kingdom come ? - Fury 's orders are ... - Look , Fury 's dead ! He 's not seeing what we 're seeing . He 's right , Bobbi . We already took the top deck . Director Fury left orders , and we 're gonna follow them . HYDRA will not get this ship and its cargo . - They won 't . - We 'll kill every last one of them . You know we can do this . Since when do you not fight for what you believe in ? You have your orders , Agent Morse . This is not a democracy . Maybe it should be . We can 't keep pretending that everything 's the same as it was yesterday . I mean , look around . Half of our friends are either dead or have turned . This isn 't a time to go down with the ship . We need to do something . We need to stop this . We 're taking back this damn ship , whether you like it or not . Let 's just hope we don 't live to regret this , Agent Morse . Let 's just hope we live . Weapons ready . All set . Hold it ! Hold on ! I 'm outside . Let 's go . Get back ! I was wrong that day . Had we followed Fury 's orders , hundreds of men and women who 'd devoted their lives to this organization would be dead . If I had been the man in charge , they 'd all be lost . So now you all operate as what ? Five friendly faces who agree on everything ? I don 't see the other four here talking to me . Just you . I have no desire to be the Director . You think I did ? Fury chose me . He made you . You are literally his creation . He thought of himself as some kind of king and made damn sure that he had an heir to the throne . Try and remember , Project Insight was Fury 's idea . Secrets are what brought S.H.I.E.L.D. down the first time . And we won 't let that happen again . If you wanted to talk to me , Agent Gonzales , you should 've talked to me . You put spies on my team , invaded my base , hurt my people . Fury 's secrets didn 't bring down S.H.I.E.L.D. , HYDRA did . I wonder if you really believe that . Guard , get this to Weaver , Fitz-Simmons . It may take some time , but they 'll figure out how to open it . You really think they 're gonna help you ? Everyone on your team is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . We 'll let them make their own decisions . Already made mine . That was a really nice entrance . - This should get you by for a few days . - Wait , what 're you talking about ? You have to go . Now . - Fitz-Simmons ... - I 'll take care of them . Without you , there is no S.H.I.E.L.D. They know about Skye , Phil . Find her . Agent May . Weaver ever tell you what happened to her at the Academy that day ? HYDRA released an Enhanced on them . Found Weaver fighting to protect the ones that were left behind . She was actually going toe-to-toe with that monster . That 's not Skye . All agents , converge on that sound ! No ! Skye ! Oh , my God . Gordon , help . Would you like to go home ? That 's a lot of umbrellas for one drink . Let me guess , she got the house . Two of whatever he 's having . Sorry I 'm late . An evacuation pod will wash up where and when it wants to . Maybe a couple of those little umbrellas if you have them ? Yeah . So how 've you been ? Anything new ? Same old , same old . So you finished your vacation ? Absolutely . You know , I never did understand the appeal of cruise ships . I almost forgot ... What 's that ? You offered me a permanent position . Consider that my contract . So what 's the plan , boss ?

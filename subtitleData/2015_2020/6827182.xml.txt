 JAVIER DELGADO : Previously on Mars . ED GRANN : We at MMC feel that we 're ready to go faster . HANA SEUNG : Phase Two expansion was underway and The Cyngus crew had arrived with experts to oversee our upgrades . Base Commander Hana Seung . We had hoped to have the second facility up by now , but we 've been running into trouble every step of the way . LESLIE RICHARDSON : Within two months we 'll have enough power to double the size and capacity of your facilities . MARTA KAMEN : Hana approved this ? LESLIE RICHARDSON : I informed her yes . JOON SEUNG : It 's a little too ambitious right now . ED GRANN : You don 't go to Mars without ambition . HANA SEUNG : No matter how hard Ed Grann 's team worked to expand Olympus Town 's infrastructure , Mars worked even harder to tear it down . JAVIER DELGADO : Oliver ! HANA SEUNG : And I was caught in the middle , trying to keep us alive . ED GRANN : Our dream is now a reality . HANA SEUNG : They don 't know Mars . ROBERT FOUCAULT : I don 't think we 're going to get a chance to get that reactor back online . [ THEME MUSIC PLAYS ] d d d d d d d d d d d d MAE : Pressurization complete , perprolate deposits detected . Please sanitize before entry . HANA SEUNG : Seung , Hana , mission entry , Phase 2 . We 've been in full storm protocol for the last two months , trying to budget the power and resources we have . The way current satellite forecasts are looking it could be anywhere between 5 to 8 , 9 weeks before the storm passes . There 's no sign of relief . Experiments have been put on hold . All EVAs suspended . The days seem like they go on forever , filled with inane tasks and darkness . SAM : And no grown-up will ever understand ... that this is a matter of so much importance ! My grandfather used to read me this book on long blizzard nights . I hope this storm ends before I have the whole thing memorized . HANA SEUNG : We never had a chance to bring the nuclear reactor back online after Oliver 's accident . The redundancies are gone and we 're on backup power . I don 't like running like this , It means we 're just one complication away from a complete outage . Dr. Leslie Richardson may be overseeing Olympus Town 's infrastructure now , but I 'm still responsible for the safety of everyone in it . PAUL RICHARDSON : Two brothers . LESLIE RICHARDSON : Nick . PAUL RICHARDSON : Twins . LESLIE RICHARDSON : That grow light can you just take it out . PAUL RICHARDSON : And their father king . [ MUMBLES ] HANA SEUNG : Doctor . LESLIE RICHARDSON : This is not a good time , sorry . HANA SEUNG : We have to start rationing power . LESLIE RICHARDSON : These lamps were inadequate to begin with and now we 're only utilizing fifty percent of their potential output . PAUL RICHARDSON : We barely have the power to keep the feed systems running . I 'm struggling to keep the crop yield as it was 2 months ago . HANA SEUNG : I know . The solar arrays are useless in the storm . We have to reserve power for critical systems . If we hadn 't taken the nuclear reactor offline before the storm ... I 've instructed Robert to dial the greenhouse power down to one-quarter output . PAUL RICHARDSON : Please . They 're only babies . HANA SEUNG : I 'm sorry . There 's nothing I can do . PAUL RICHARDSON : Would you leave me alone , please ? HANA SEUNG : Of course . PAUL RICHARDSON : I 'm sorry ... Truly sorry . HANA SEUNG : With Robert squeezing every last bit of energy out of our reserves , we were all just hanging on , as we tried to weather the storm . JIM GREEN : We 've been studying the dust storms on Mars for quite some time , and there 's a particular season where some of the dust storms can actually go global . Not just regional , but global . Dust storms on Mars can be absolutely enormous . They can be 20 to 30 kilometers high , and in fact the dust can get charged and , in the case of these really tall dust storms , lightning can strike . ANDY WEIR : These dust storms are huge . They can cover the entire planet , and they can last for months . They 're visible from space . Mars just kind of turns into a hazy , red ball , and we can 't see surface features anymore with our satellites . The dust , it 's not like sand . Tt 's like talcum powder . Tt 's very , very microscopic-ly small nasty dust particles . and if they get into your lungs , it 's a human safety issue . So you would want to try to keep it out as much as possible . STEPHEN PETRANEK : There 's a lot of dust on Mars . You know we 've learned from our rovers on Mars that they 're constantly getting covered in dust . And one of the problems with solar panels is that dust would cover them almost instantly , or they would simply block out the sun so much that they don 't work . If you 've got a dust storm that lasted for a month on Mars , and you were relying on solar power you 'd be in big trouble . PAUL RICHARDSON : We have no energy and I can 't keep my plants alive . [ THUNDER ] This storm has been raging for months . They call it a season . I can 't do my job . BOARD MEMBER : You told us that we were sending the best minds on Earth , doubling the power , expanding the infrastructure . These people have been trapped in a dust storm for two months with a third of the power they had before you had your prodigy shut it down . ED GRANN : This storm is just a bump in the road . We have the world 's leading agronomist working around the clock . He 's getting hybrids producing , and that will make Olympus Town self-sustaining . That means Mars will have the resources to feed thousands of people , and those people are going to need rockets to get there . We own the hybrids , and we build the rockets . We just have to play the long game . PAUL RICHARDSON : She left , she left , but not you . It 's gonna be okay . These are the times that try men 's souls . AMELIE DURAND : Paul Richardson please report to the MedLab . Paul Richardson please report to the MedLab . AVA LEE : But this storm . AMELIE DURAND : I know . Dr. Richardson , please come in . PAUL RICHARDSON : Look , if this is a bad time , I 've got a lot of work to do . AMELIE DURAND : No , no , no . We 'll talk more at next week 's session , and I 'm here in the meantime whenever you need me , okay ? Come in . Just a quick examination and you 'll be on your way . This storm , it 's getting to everyone . How are you holding up ? PAUL RICHARDSON : I 'm fine . AMELIE DURAND : You prepare for everything you can , but there are some things you just cannot train for . Are you missing home ? PAUL RICHARDSON : No . AMELIE DURAND : That would be okay , you know . To miss home . It would be normal , even . PAUL RICHARDSON : I 'm okay . AMELIE DURAND : And your wife ? How are things with you and her ? PAUL RICHARDSON : We 're working mostly . Look , I could really ... AMELIE DURAND : And how is the work ? The hybrids , how are they coming along ? PAUL RICHARDSON : They 're trying . They 're really trying . AMELIE DURAND : Hey . I know it 's hard especially now , but maybe the best thing is to take a little time away from the work and refill the well . PAUL RICHARDSON : Okay , thank you . AMELIE DURAND : Thank you . PAUL RICHARDSON : I couldn 't save them . They weren 't strong enough . They died so that you could live . It 's all on you . It 's all on you . We 're going to be strong . Just remember , we have it in our power to start the world over again . [ LIGHTNING STRIKES ] We have the power . ROBERT FOUCAULT : God bless Mars . STEPHEN PETRANEK : Mars sounds like a terrifically romantic idea , what could be a greater adventure ? The realities of this adventure are almost depressing , and they 're significant . There are a lot of challenges involved in surviving in a very small spacecraft with a few other human beings for eight months at a time and then being able to deal with the idea that you 're not going back to Earth for possibly decades . So that you 're leaving everything behind , and maintaining a psychological balance in what is really a vast desert and unfriendly environment is not going to be easy for people . NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON : It 's always wise to test what you 're about to do , in advance . You wanna live on Mars isolated ? Create some kind of HAB module on Earth , test that in advance . TRISTAN BASSINGTHWAIGHTE : We 've been here just over seven months and we 've got just under five to go so it 's like 140 something days left , um , it 's been a long time . KIM BINSTED : HI-SEAS is a NASA-funded research analog and simulation . It 's located at about 8,000 feet on the slopes of Mauna Loa here on Hawaii , so the crews we put there are very isolated . The goal of HI-SEAS is to be as close as possible to a Mars mission , so that means we put a lot of constraints on the crew . ANDY WEIR : Groups of people living together is what civilization is . We 're very good at it . Interestingly the biggest problem is when you have a small group of people . ANDRZEJ STEWART : So you 'll notice there are only four crew members here , and well here are the other , here are the other two . ANDY WEIR : You have a small number of people , the , the biggest risk to the mission 's success is those people not getting along . And even if they 're very , very professional about it , if they 're not getting along and they 're not communicating enough , there 's going to be problems . MARY ROACH : Talk to people that have been in prison , the lack of control over your environment and your life is stressful , to not be able to just do what you want to do when you want to do it is a , a stressor . This is what it will be like to be on a Mars mission . ANDRZEJ STEWART : I know that we face far less danger than a Mars mission , and that 's okay . This is a simulation just like any other simulation but these aren 't just simulated effects , these are real . You really are isolated , you really do feel separated from Planet Earth and this is the part of the simulation that NASA is interested in . KIM BINSTED : What we 're concerned with is how resilient are the crew . If you think about it , the human part of a Mars mission is just as critical as the technological part . If the human part breaks , it 's just as disastrous as if the rocket blows up . [ SIGHS ] ROBERT FOUCAULT : How 's it going Emmanuel ? I , I know that I haven 't been around a lot . I 've been working really hard . Systems are all experiencing losses and moving slowly . We are trying to work together as a team , some days are good , some days are rough and it 's okay , you know . I never realized how hard it was trying to hold it together . Just be tough . Just be tough . PAUL RICHARDSON : I can 't keep the plants alive at this level . LESLIE RICHARDSON : I know . What do you want me to say ? We should have been at twice the power now at least . So I don 't know what else to say . PAUL RICHARDSON : And no one anticipated a storm of this magnitude ? LESLIE RICHARDSON : Of course not . That storm was moving faster than anything we 've ever monitored this early in the season . How could we ? The plan was there . There 's nothing else we can do at this point . Let 's face it . Ugh , God , really ? Do you even try to tidy up before you come home ? I mean , I did my job . The team 's training was impeccable . The plan was bulletproof . It should have worked ! We should have had nuclear fully up and running by now . Before we even got here . Do you think I don 't feel awful that Oliver got hurt ? It 's constantly on my mind . Did you know sometimes I feel as if people are not really looking at me as I pass them in the hall ? Paul , darling ? d d d d AMELIE DURAND : Also showing emotional strain is Dr. Richardson , Paul J. While Richardson reports no psychological issues , his affect and behavior with the crew is ... I request psychiatric consultation and review of prior and current mental health testing . Please send all records via private med link . Thanks . ROBERT FOUCAULT : The lightning strike must have blown a junction box between Olympus and the reserve power station . JAVIER DELGADO : Every second that passes we 're draining batteries just keeping air breathable and heat running . SAM : I 've got MAE back online in the main terminal . HANA SEUNG : MAE , what 's the status on critical systems ? MAE : Climate recycling rate decreased to 75 % nominal . Current rate of temperature decline three degrees celsius per hour . ROBERT FOUCAULT : I have to make repairs . HANA SEUNG : There 's no way I 'm sending anyone out there , it 's way too dangerous . AMELIE DURAND : There 's no visibility , you 'll be completely blind . JAVIER DELGADO : We 'll take the rover , get as close as we can . ROBERT FOUCAULT : It 'll be slow going , but it 's the only shot we have . JAVIER DELGADO : It is . HANA SEUNG : All right , good luck . ED GRANN : Hey , I 've been calling . JOON SEUNG : I 'm sorry , I 've had my hands full , two-and-a-half months in a dust storm means clean-up down here too . Walk with me . ED GRANN : I want to talk to you about increasing freighter launches , our assembly line can handle it . JOON SEUNG : I 'm still doing damage control after losing power in the middle of a dust storm , and you want to talk to me about freighters ? The nations are getting cold feet , Ed . This is a public relations exercise , and the public sentiment is as low as it 's ever been . China is talking about pulling out . ED GRANN : Don 't worry about that . As long as the US and EU stay on board , no way China risks missing out on the glory down the road . JOON SEUNG : Olympus Town was ready for this storm ; the nuclear reactor was operational before you gambled on an accelerated schedule . Your expansion plan was science fiction . ED GRANN : The money doesn 't come without expansion . No money , no MMC ; no MMC , no mission . It was the right play . JOON SEUNG : This isn 't some lush frontier land . They are fighting for every step of the way . If we push too hard too fast , something 's going to break . MAE : Interference detected in all navigational systems . JAVIER DELGADO : The electrostatics are whacking guidance to hell . I can 't see anything . ROBERT FOUCAULT : We can triangulate that down to a seven-and-a-half meter-discrepancy . JAVIER DELGADO : Good thing I came to help . ROBERT FOUCAULT : When I was a child , the Harmattan wind would blow into Lagos from the Sahara . Sand storms would cover the whole city , sometimes all the way to the ocean . People would lose their way , turn up kilometers out , skin raw from sand burn , lungs filled with dust . You 'll have plenty to do when we find that junction box just making sure I don 't get lost out there . Believe me , I am grateful for the company . JAVIER DELGADO : Do you still think about it , the ocean ? ROBERT FOUCAULT : Every day . Trouble is , every time it 's like the waves are getting a little quieter . JAVIER DELGADO : Like someone 's turning down the volume . ROBERT FOUCAULT : Yeah , last week I realized I couldn 't even remember what the ocean sounded like . JAVIER DELGADO : Yeah . ROBERT FOUCAULT : We 're going to be okay . JAVIER DELGADO : You sure about that ? ROBERT FOUCAULT : Well , I hope so . [ LAUGHTER ] [ MUMBLING ] PAUL RICHARDSON : Let 's talk of groves of warmth , look at you , look at you . You are so strong . Oh , well done , you clever , clever thing . How about I introduce you to your brothers ? For God 's sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings . How some have been deposed , some slain in war , some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed . Some poisoned by their wives and ... [ INAUDIBLE ] You are gonna love this . This is going to be a treat just for you . Botanist , my ass . AMELIE DURAND : Leslie ! LESLIE RICHARDSON : Oh , look , I 'm up to date on weekly so if this is supplemental , I can save you the trouble . I miss home , but I 'm not homesick ; I don 't ever think of hurting myself or anyone else ; I 'm not experiencing any more stress than anyone would under the circumstances , and the only voices in my head are the ones telling me to get back to work . AMELIE DURAND : I 'm not worried about you . I spoke to Paul and he seemed , distant . LESLIE RICHARDSON : He 's just focused . AMELIE DURAND : I checked his ration allotment and he 's hardly eating . LESLIE RICHARDSON : He forgets sometimes . Look , he lives for his work and he can 't do it . What do you expect ? Can I go now ? AMELIE DURAND : Yeah , sure . DAVID DINGES : We don 't think it 's a trivial thing to send people off to Mars and just assume that intelligence and motivation and getting along before they go is going to be enough . We actually have to understand who is going to have a real problem with prolonged exploration in an extreme environment . Not everyone can tolerate the isolation , the loneliness , the risk to life and limb . Some people disintegrate psychologically and behaviorally and you look back at many of the explorations where humans moved , where humans moved across thousands of miles you typically will see dysfunction occur in crews . It happened on Shackleton 's mission to the South Pole . He puts his men off at Elephant Island and tries to get to South Georgia Island , 800 miles in heavy seas . But he 's got a very dysfunctional carpenter , psychologically sick , so he has to take him along cause he can 't leave him with the crew because it 's going to create chaos . On Mars , just like the Nineteenth Century explorers , you might see fragmenting of the crews and you find these dynamics in these historical records and you see how problematic they are for the success of the mission . MARTA KAMEN : Someone wrote this at the end of the Fourth Century , St. Augustine : my memory contains my feelings . not in the same way as they are present in the mind when it experiences them , but in a quite different way . that is in keeping with the special powers of the memory . for even when I am unhappy I can remember times when I was cheerful . and when I 'm cheerful I can remember past unhappiness . I can recall past fears , and yet not feel afraid and when I remember that once I wanted something , I can do so without wishing to have it now . AMELIE DURAND : Marty ? Look at me in the eyes . MARTA KAMEN : Sometimes memory can induce the opposite feeling . AMELIE DURAND : Jake , are you still taking your antibiotics ? MARTA KAMEN : For I can be glad to remember sorrow that is over and done with . AMELIE DURAND : Alex , feeling better ? ALEX : Yes , yes thank you . MARTA KAMEN : And sorry to remember happiness that has come to an end . d d d d d d d d [ HIGH WINDS ] JAVIER DELGADO : Anything ? Okay , just a second . Okay , I got your signal . Junction box should be less than five meters out , six degrees north-east . Anything ? ROBERT FOUCAULT : Negative . JAVIER DELGADO : You should be seeing the cable now . ROBERT FOUCAULT : I have no visual . JAVIER DELGADO : Robert it 's ... [ STATIC ] ROBERT FOUCAULT : You 're breaking up , Javier . I can 't hear you . JAVIER DELGADO : What ? ROBERT FOUCAULT : Storm 's interfering with the signal . Javier , Javier ? JAVIER DELGADO : Robert , do you copy ? ROBERT FOUCAULT : Hello , Javier ? JAVIER DELGADO : I said it 's dead ahead , dead ahead . ROBERT FOUCAULT : Copy that . [ WIND GUSTING ] Damn it . JAVIER DELGADO : You okay ? Robert , you okay ? Robert ? ROBERT FOUCAULT : I 'm out of room on my tether . JAVIER DELGADO : Okay , Robert . You need to come back to the rover . I can 't move the rover any farther forward because of the terrain . It 's too dangerous out there with this storm . So we can 't risk it . Come back . Robert , you need to come back . ROBERT FOUCAULT : I 'm going to unclip . JAVIER DELGADO : No , no , no , no , Robert , do not unclip . Do not unclip , Robert . Come back . Robert , Robert , do you copy ? Do not unclip Robert ! Robert , answer me . Robert , do not unclip . Can you hear me Robert ? ROBERT FOUCAULT : Where are you ? JAVIER DELGADO : Robert , come on . Robert ! Come on , Robert . Robert , I need you , come back here . Robert , Robert ! DAVID DINGES : The challenge people face when they do exploration is that they 're used to handling conflict or disagreement or dislike with each other by separating , and being apart for awhile . With spaceflight , or any exploration that involves intense confinement , where you can 't get away from the other people , and you 're all in a very tiny space , the whole idea of individual territoriality becomes a problem . This sounds astonishing . Billion dollar explorations and yet it comes down to the little things that will often determine what happens . These things definitely occur , they occur in the Antarctic , and they occur in other analogs . The Russians created something called a Mars 500 mission which was a 520 day full simulation of a crew of six to Mars and back . MAN : They will live as if they were in an interplanetary spaceship . They will eat , sleep , and train as if they were real astronauts . DAVID DINGES : They sealed the crew in the chamber and isolated them so you couldn 't have social contact , and then they held the crew to not only the time delays , but to a full simulated mission to Mars so there was a landing on the martian surface simulated , and it was many , many months , and to go to the bottom line , out of six crew members , two managed to maintain stable activity levels and were psychologically healthy . Four other crew members experienced problems with mood , emotion , impulsivity , insomnia . These were people who were astronaut trainers and physicians so they knew about space life . Even with that kind of a skilled and analog crew that is close to astronauts , you find the crew is suffering . We don 't understand why people equally trained and equally intelligent , equally capable as astronauts will have different rates of vulnerability . We actually have to understand who is going to have a real problem in space flight because ultimately there are some people who are going to have a really hard time . [ GUSTING WINDS ] JAVIER DELGADO : Robert , come on Robert , talk to me . ROBERT FOUCAULT : Where are you ? JAVIER DELGADO : Come back here . Robert do you copy ?

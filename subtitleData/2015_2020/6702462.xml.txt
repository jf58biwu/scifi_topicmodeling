 ATOMIC SHARK Let us face , without panic ... the reality of our time ... the fact that atom bombs may someday be dropped on our city . And let us prepare for survival . Understanding the weapon that threatens us . An atom bomb destroys or injures in three ways ... by blast , heat , and radioactivity . Five , four , three , two , one . Now I am become death ... the destroyer of worlds . Hey ! Rottger ! Stop the boat ! Rottger , no ! There 's a shark ! Rottger ! Come back ! Rottger ! Wha ... my god ! No ! No ! Sara ! Sara ! Felice and I were enjoying this hot ... but beautiful day here in San Diego ... when I stumbled across these guys . I want to know just what Uncle Sam 's boys are up to . We are tax-paying citizens , so we got a right to know ! No media ! No media ! What 's going on , dude ? I 'll give you ten seconds to get out of here ... before I arrest you . You work for me , brother ! What 's going on ? We have an environmental crisis , San Diego . You bet we have an environmental crisis ... but we have lost our freedom . It 's time to stand up for our rights . Clearly they know something they 're not telling us . We have to reclaim our freedom . What she said . Hey yo , what 's up , Kap-man ? Shut up ! Awesome ! Don 't touch that . Jeez , a little possessive , are we ? That 's how you lose a finger . Not cool , man . So , what , you fly around , look for fins with that thing ? I 'm supposed to keep an eye out in the water for some sharks ... shadows of sharks , silhouettes of sharks . Sounds like a perfect job for you ... otherwise you 're a useless lifeguard ... with that cast on your leg . Get out of here . GINA Kaplan ? Go for Kap . Switch to two . What 's up , Gina ? Another dead , burnt fish , a herring this time . KAPLAN Yummy ! That 's 20-something in two weeks . Did you see it wash up ? No . Do you see it on the beach ? I 'm telling you , somebody 's messing with you , Gina . No , I think we have an environmental event going on . You know , you get kinda sexy ... when you 're all activisty like that . Okay , you 're not taking this seriously . I am , but to a hammer ... every single problem seems like a nail . Gina ? Hello ? GINA Swimmer in distress , 100 yards out ! Help me . Are you injured ? No , I got a cramp ! Okay . Hold this and try to relax . You 're okay . You got it . I 'm gonna swim you to shore . You 're okay . I got another cramp ! Okay , just ... Just sign here and here and you 're good to go . Saving lives . Hashtag beach life . Hashtag rise and grind . Hashtag we go hard . Hashtag is it Friday yet ? Damn it , I 'm out of characters . Kylie , if you spent as much time doing your job ... as you do posting on Instagram ... You jelly ? Of creepy guys getting photos of you for their spank bank ? 87,000 creepy guys and counting . Seems like my work is far more meaningful ... than in vitro science or whatever you 're doing , okay ? It 's environmental science . Whatever . You go into debt , I 'm going viral . I 'm sure you already have gone viral . You do not have authorization to use this drone for anything ... other than keeping a lookout for sharks . I got out there faster , man . Faster than an actual person . So ... Well , what if something had gone wrong ? We would be held liable . Financially ... legally . I mean , at the end of the day , I saved a person 's life ... successfully , so , I 'll never do it again . Thanks for the talk . Nice to see your injury hasn 't compromised your sense of humor . You know what ? I got a good joke for you . What do you call a lifeguard who can 't swim ? Unemployed . No , damn it , I haven 't had a drink . Come on , Rottger . I 'm telling you , I saw with my own eyes . Where did this happen ? By Coronado Island . Rottger , a guy comes to you , says he saw something out there . Something extraordinary . A UFO . It was a shark or something like that . It was glowing , there was red . What difference does it make what it was ? It ripped my customer in half ! You got a dead body to show me ? No , the body 's out there floating around somewhere . Whatever the hell that thing was , it was coming after me . So I got the hell out of there ! Look , you 're gonna do something about this or you 're not . It doesn 't make a difference to me ! Okay , all right . Hey . Were you telling him the truth ? Excuse me ? About the shark , were you telling him the truth ? I always tell the truth . Is everything all right ? Yeah , yeah , it 's fine . This is ... this is Rich Rottger . He said his friend was killed by a shark . Mr. Rottger . It 's Captain , actually . You own a boat , they call you Captain . It 's Captain . Aye , Captain . What do you think it was ? You went to college , didn 't you ? Yeah . Think you 're so damn smart , why don 't you tell me . God , how do you know that guy ? Just crossed paths a couple times . Hey , guys , Henry Wallace , I own the restaurant across the way . Tales From the Dockside Grill . That 's the one . Skip Forte , reality TV guy gonna be filming us tomorrow . Dinner and drinks on the house . All right . All right ... thanks . Back to work . Bang-stick , shark-stick ... whatever you call it , it 's a specialized underwater firearm . You can also stab them from above . Wouldn 't a gun be more practical ? Let me show you . A shark approaches ... bang ! Used one on a hammerhead back in '97 when I was skin-diving . Take this over a gun any day . This here 's the chamber . Live round goes right there . Standard .44 Magnum shell . What the hell are you looking at ? REESE Kaplan ? Go for Kap . Would you care to tell me what exactly the hell you 're doing ? Sure . I 'm patrolling the water . Currently hovering over the safe water marker . Cool . Such a tool . KAPLAN Gina ? What 's up ? I 'm feeling something out over the safe water marker right now . But I can 't make it out , can you spot me ? Shark ! There 's a shark in the water ! Shark ! Out of the water ! Everyone out of the water ! KAPLAN Gina ... false alarm . It was just a dolphin . Sorry , everyone ! There 's no shark . What ? It is safe to return to the water . It 's just a dolphin . It 's fine . Totally safe . Cal Henning , we 're about to put on a fly boarding show ... for the Fourth of July , man . It 's gonna be dope . In case of an actual raid or test drill the alert will be a warbling siren blast ... lasting three minutes . Yay ! You know what ? That would be a great profile pic . I agree , eBay , you can do it . Gina ! Look who I found . Troy and Felice Henley . - Hi ! - Gina , nice to meet you . Environmental crisis . Yeah , Kaplan 's a big fan . Kaplan tells me you 're an environmental scientist . Well , I 'm studying to be one , yeah . Yeah , I 'm really excited to interview you . Yeah , your name 's Gina , right ? I ... I can 't do an interview . I 'm working right now . You got time . We got time . No , really , I can 't do it . Kaplan , no , I 'm sorry , I 'm too ... You have to ! I 'm sorry , I 'm too ... Yeah , if you could just have this seat . What is going on ? Let 's take a deep breath , you got this , okay ? You look great , you ready-ready ? And ... action . We have Gina Delamo here . A life guard and an environmental scientist who is ... I 'm going to school to be an environmental ... Just go with it . Gina , I have personally seen government ships ... snooping around in this area . And I 've talked to swimmers ... and I 've talked to boating enthusiasts ... who 've claimed to have seen a large , bright , red ... glowing shark-like creature . What could cause such a terrifying thing ? I don 't know . Tell them about the fish ... the fish . I 've seen several burnt fish that washed ashore . And we 've got reports about a shark ... things that people are saying some stuff about radiation . Radiation ? What would radiation do to a shark ? Make it glow ? Possibly , but most likely it would mutate . Mutation happens naturally in evolution ... due to environmental conditions . And for example , the fish ... The Tomcod ... it mutated during the Industrial Revolution ... due to the toxic waste that was being dumped ... into the Hudson River . But this , though , this would be ... different . This shark would be radioactive . And emit very intense heat . What can the environmental crisis family do to help ? If the shark is radioactive ... I don 't know that anybody could do anything ... to help . It 'd basically be impossible to kill . Hey , Kylie ? Hi , sweetie . I read on Facebook that more people die ... from taking selfies than from shark attacks . Is that true ? Of course not . Help ! Help ! Hey ! No , don 't laugh again ! Hey ! Hey ! There 's a kid drowning ! Get in here , Kaplan . Come on , get in . Sign up with us . Hey , call 9-1-1 ! Yeah . Take it easy , man . He 's unconscious ! You , take him in slowly ! You blow ! Okay . One , two , three . One , two , three . One , two , three . One , two , three . Come on , kid , breathe ! One , two , thr ... You don 't have to stop . You 're gonna be okay , buddy . I think I need some more air . We 'll put you on oxygen in the hospital . Get up , kid . All right , they 're on their way . He 's okay . He 's all right . Okay . You okay , buddy ? Paramedics are on their way . I 'll ride with him to the hospital . You 're supervisor 'til I get back . Try not to screw things up . Hey ! Hey ! Shark ! Help us ! Hey ! Help us ! Get it , Felice ! Tight on the parasails . Yeah , there it is . Call 9-1-1 ! Kaplan , don 't ! It 's too dangerous ! Do it now ! Kaplan ! Hey ! Hey ! My god ! Look ! No ! Help ! Help ! Somebody help ! My god . Go back ! Go back ! Kaplan , swim ! Kaplan , get out of the water ! Kaplan ! Come on ! My god , are you okay ? I 'm better than those people . I 'll be back . Did she just flee the scene ? What happened out there ? Same thing as happened last night . Was it a shark ? If it 's a shark , it 's dangerous . No kidding . No , I mean very dangerous . Don 't you have somebody else to bother . Can you just take me out there with you ? I need to see what you saw . It 's not that easy . I didn 't say it was easy . I just said I want to see it for myself ... so I can figure out how to stop it . Don 't you want to do anything to help ? Not today , I don 't , not on some college research trip . That won 't do anything but get us killed . 30 minutes ! Take it easy , man . I leave you alone for a measly 30 minutes ... and now I have five dead , and one injured . And who the hell cleared your gimp-ass to get in the water ? It was the right thing to do . Something really bad was going on out there . Yeah , it 's called a boating accident . Engines don 't just spontaneously combust . It was an engine fire ! That 's the official word . From who ? Official word from who ? The Feds . I got a call on the radio , on a secret government channel . And they said the engine caught on fire . That 's the story ! How would they even know ? It doesn 't matter . I got the call ! That 's the story ! That 's crazy , man . You want to see crazy ? I 'll show you crazy . Reese , stop , man ! You weren 't there , man , okay ? You didn 't see what I saw . I don 't think ... No ... you don 't . You never did . You 're fired . I 'm gonna need you to turn in your whistle . Yo ! Got fired , guys ! Just got fired ! Hey , do you know I got fired ? D 'you know it ? I got fired . Good for you . I got fired . I 'm sorry . Yeah , you know , it happens . Kylie , team meeting ! Hey , be careful , he might fire you , too . Hey , guys , you know I got fired today ? I just got fired . God , I got fired , man . So did the fish . You ever see anything like this ? Gina was right about this . What do you think could cause something like this ? We gotta talk to Gina . Let 's go . What 's going on out here , man ? SKIP You cook it ... I 'll guess . SKIP Yeah ! Okay , he 's coming , he 's coming , he 's coming . Here you go . It 's Mr. Forte , everybody . Action ! Skip Forte ! In the flesh . Welcome to the best damn restaurant in San Diego . I 'll be the judge of that . Cut ! Mr. Wallace ... Please call me Henry . Right . Mr. Forte doesn 't like to be touched . It 's fine , Erica . He 's just being nice . Don 't touch him . Walk this way ? After you , Mr. Forte . We are very behind today ... and Mr. Forte has a radio interview in two hours . So , please resist the urge to small talk . As discussed , we will enter through the back door ... and begin with the tour of the kitchen . We 'll shoot a couple passes of that ... before we go into the main dining area . Is the food ready ? Cha , cha ... cha , cha ... Let me see the fish . Fish time . Never met a girl with her own Geiger counter before . Golly ! That is not what it smelled like when I put that in there . All right , let 's just ... Let 's go again , come on . Let 's just do this fast . Yeah ! Yeah ... it 's there . What 's where ? Energetic subatomic particles . Radiation ... the fish has it . What could cause this ? I don 't know . I 'm still searching . Well , I 'm pretty sure the government knows ... because these guys are crawling all over the place . Yeah , they cleaned up those fish fast . And absconded with my footage . Okay , so if this thing is pumped full of radiation ... should we be sitting next to it ? No ! Definitely not . We should not be sitting next to it at all . Man , get that thing out of here . Jeez . Listen up , people ! We are moving into this room now . Be very quiet , otherwise , we have to start all over again . It 's important to look like we 're having a great time , okay ? But no talking , just act like you are . Pantomime . And one more thing ; don 't look at Skip . Just pretend we 're not even here . Action rehearsal . Stop ! Let 's just lose the head nodding . Move your lips , not your head . Ready , Skip ? Just call it already . And action ! Okay , you ready ? And action ! What 's on the menu today , boss ? Well , Skip , I thought I would start you off ... with our best seller , Mahi-mahi ... with sauteed onions , peppers , and minced garlic . Hold up , hold up . Don 't tell me the ingredients , let me chew , just let me chew . Let me chew and then I 'll guess , you look impressed . Have you seen the show ? Yes . Good . Let 's go again . Reset it ! Skip ! And ... action ! What 's on the menu today , boss ? Well , Skip , I thought I 'd start you off with our best seller ... it 's mahi-mahi . Sit down ! You 're being disruptive . Skip Forte . Hm . That is some good fish ! Sauteed onions , obviously , bay leaves , tomatoes ... but what is this sauteed in ? Is that curry red ketchup ? - Well , it is . - That 's a bingo ! Excuse me ! We 're filming ! One more time and you 're out of here ! I 'm taking it back ! I 'm taking it back again . I 'm taking it ... Sorry . Is that thing broken ? I just calibrated it . But what is it sauteed in ? Is this ... is this curry red ketchup ? Yes , you 're right . Yes ! That 's impressive . Tell me , tell me about the fish . Well , Skip , it 's local , it 's very fresh . It 's our catch of the day . Ho-ho , it 's got some kick to it . Well , that could be the crushed red pepper . I told you not to tell me the ingredients ! How many times he gonna tell you ... don 't tell him the ingredients ! How many times ? Come on ! No . Hey , do you want to get another ... We have to warn them ! Mr. Forte ? Skip ! Skip ! Mr. Forte ? Mr. Forte ? Skip . What happened , man ? Help ! Go ask for help ! Help ! Mr. Forte ! Holy shnikes ! My god ! Help ! Reese , what the hell are you doing ? We have to get these people off the beach . Because of a gas explosion in a restaurant ? There was no gas explosion ! Tell that to the Fire Marshal . You know damn well he 's not gonna listen to me . Who would ? Spouting all that B.S. about nuclear radiation ... It 's the truth and you know it . And that makes restaurants go boom ? It happened . We saw it , man . Why are you here ? I thought I fired you ? What about all the dead fish I 've been reporting to you ? You mean the fish that were burnt to death ... during that parasailing fire ? That 's not what caused it ! Then what did ? Is there an Atomic Jelly Fish on the loose ? It 's a shark ! Well , the apple doesn 't fall too far from the tree now , does it ? No ! Gina 's got you down , Reese ! You going down , Reese ! You down ! Put him in the arm bar , Gina ! Arm bar , bitch ! Reese , you 're down , you better tap , baby ... you better tap . That 's it ! Gina won the fight ! Ding , ding , ding ! Come on , Gina ... Gina ? Gina , come on . Gina Delamo wins this fight easy . King Kong ain 't got nothing on Gina Delamo ! Greatest of all time ! Woo-hoo ! You just kicked ass . Make sure to turn in your uniform . I want it for the wall of shame . No one is gonna believe us without proof . Yeah , if we got proof ... we could post it on Troy and Felice 's channel . They get millions of eyeballs each week . What if we rigged the Geiger counter to your drone ? Fly it out to sea , find the shark ourselves ? I mean , it 's a great idea , but the drone 's busted . It 's gonna take weeks to get new parts . Damn it ! Hold on . Where are you going ? Come on . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Getting us a new drone . There 's our perv . Let 's get him ! I think he 's upstairs . Okay , just follow me this way . Okay . Take it , baby , that is the money shot . Hey , there . I heard you were looking for a model to photograph . Well , yes , come on in . Hi , I 'm Fletcher . Yeah . So ... So ... Freeze ! Who the hell are you ? We 're cops , okay ? We 're here to confiscate these drones . No ! Nothing I do here is illegal , okay ? I 'm a legitimate business man . I 'll prove it . Look ! See ? See ? Look , see ? See it ? Those women give you permission to photograph them ? The beach is public domain . I don 't really think the law works that way . Yeah , sure it does . Look . Look , see ? See ? There 's that ... not into that , that 's not my thing . Definitely not into that , that 's awful . No , I bet that 's a ... Wait a second . You guys aren 't cops . You 're the lifeguards ... and from what I 've seen , not very good ones . You need a quadcopter for shark hunting ? Don 't you ? Pretty much , yeah . Well , mine are custom made , longer battery ... longer range , fast . 5,000 bucks , it 's yours . What ? Call police . SIRI Searching Polish sausage restaurants . No , fine , go ahead . Impersonating a police officer is serious business , okay ? SIRI I found three results ... We 'll hold . For Polish sausage restaurants in your area . Would you like me to list them ? Okay , fine , fine , fine , I 'll make you a deal ... if you guys just leave me alone ... Yeah , we 're listening . Hang up the phone , man ! Talk . Okay , I got a video that you might be interested in . You have nothing I want to see . You 're gonna want to see this , trust me . Okay ... I was cruising around the harbor last night ... looking for some ... some late night action ... when I saw ... this . Get ready to wet yourselves . Does it keep going ? That 's basically it . But I was getting some kind of interference . Go back a few frames . That 's our fish . I was gonna post it online , but , honestly ... people would just scream it 's a fake . Right , yeah . 1,000 bucks for this video and one of my mid-level drones . Troy . - 1,000 bucks ? - 1,000 bucks . Meet us at the beach at the Havana Hotel . $ 800 , I 'll throw in the boom box . Would you take a check ? I 'll take anything . There 's no one in the water . You noticed ? Well , get out there . These people look up to us . Get out there and show them there 's nothing to be afraid of . I 'm not so sure there isn 't . There 's an overage of lifeguards in La Jolla . I 'm going out there this afternoon ... to grab my pick of the litter . I like looking at you , Kylie ... but I can replace you . Understand ? How 's the water ? It 's nice ! Warm . Dude , where the hell are you going ? Dude , yellow , bitch ! Whatever , man . I don 't know . What do you mean ? It 's right there . I see it , but it 's just not enough . We know what it is , but to our viewers , it could be anything . They 'll just call this a fake . That 's what I said . Where did this damn thing come from ? I wondered the same thing , and then I did some Googling . So there 's rumors of a Soviet sub sinking about 30 miles out from San Diego , back in the ' 80s . I think it 's really there ... and leaking radiation . Check it out . I rigged a Geiger counter , so it sits on the edge of frame here . That 's pretty genius . Can you work with it ? If he can get that thing to go off with the shark in frame ... heck , yeah , I 'll work with it , I 'll post it . All right , all right , all right . All right , all right , make sure we roll all of this . Easy ... easy does it . Good job . Here we go . Sons of bitches ! Kylie ! Kylie ! Down here ! Hey , you feeling better ? A lot ... take a picture with me ... so I can always remember the girl that saved my life . That 's so sweet , of course . Uncle Rick , take the picture . Moving closer ! Get everyone out of the water ! Shark ! REESE You 're not authorized ... to be on this channel . Hand over your radio now ! Kylie ! Do you hear me ? Shark ! GINA Get everyone out of the water ! Kylie ! What are you doing ? Fly the thing ! Stop it . What are you doing ? We need a close-up ! You can 't get any closer ! Yes , I can ! Guys , not now ! Focus ! You 're making this way harder than it needs to be . - This is incredibly difficult . - Give it here ! Hey ! Reese ! Are you serious right now ? Are you serious ? What 's your deal , man ? Reese , there is a shark in the water . I 'm coming with you . There are no damn sharks ! Yes , there is ! Why are you doing this ? There 's blood in the water , you idiot ! We have to get the people out . There are no sharks ! Shark ! My god ! Shark ! Where are you guys going ? Lower , baby . Yeah , time for the money shot . You can 't go any lower . Shark ! Shark , everybody ! Come in ! Come in ! Let 's go , let 's go ! Get out ! Come on ! Hey ! Get in ! Come ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Come here ! Come here ! Get in ! Lower , baby . You can 't go any closer ! - Yes , I can ! - I 'm telling you . Damn it ! Look what you did ! I did it ? Great job ! Yes , you did ! I 'm blind ! No ... I think it 's reaching critical mass ! He 's gonna to blow ! Did you get it ? Yeah , I got it ! Damn it ! I know what you do . You guys okay ? Yeah , well , the shark 's da ' bomb ... so I 'm pretty much gonna need therapy for the rest of my life . You ? Lost my footage . We noticed . We overheard cops talking . Looks like military 's coming in . That 's a good thing , right ? Not really . The military 's gonna shoot first ... and ask questions later , but in this scenario there won 't be a later . What do you mean ? Did you see what just happened ? Kind of , my monitor was in and out . The shark 's energy is unstable . Without the seawater to cool it down , it 'll overheat ... like a nuclear reactor . The military is gonna shoot to kill ... and the second any substantial firepower touches that thing ... The coast is toast . Normally I 'd say that sounds crazy ... but sanity took a leave of absence today . What if we lure it out to sea ? I mean way out . We have a boat . Troy spent a fortune putting her together . There 's nothing faster . Then what ? Then we blow it up ? Cool , that sounds dangerous . What if we had a second boat ? Like a bait boat . Bait boat ? Yeah , something we can rig with dynamite ... or gas cans or something . So we blow the boat , blow the shark , save the west coast ? I have an idea . Go get another drone from Fletcher ... and find some chum , a lot of it ! What ! Where are you going ? Just keep your phone on you . Where am I gonna find chum ? Come on ! I know you 're in there ! It 's open ! Have a seat . I can 't stay . Suit yourself . Neither can you . I need your help to kill that thing . The Navy squids and half the world are out there ... chasing that thing , you don 't need my help ... it 'll be dead by morning . Then so will we . I tried to tell you ! The shark is infected . Infected ? Radiation in its DNA ... that basically turns it into a biological atomic bomb . If it goes off near land ... the whole Southern California coast will be uninhabitable ... for the next 20,000 years . Well , I 'm sorry to hear that ... but you 'll have to find yourself another captain . Dad ... Divorce is always hard on kids . It 's hard on everyone . You left ! I wanted to believe you , but you left . So I just ... I believed the person that was there for me . You are all that I have left . Why won 't you just help me ? Gina ? What ? When do you want to leave ? Does right now work ? You got a plan ? Well , I mean , I still need help with the details ... but it kind of involves blowing up your boat . Perfect . What are you doing here ? Man , who invited this guy ? The drone comes , so do I. Can 't afford to have you crash another one . My baby did not crash your ... Are you kidding me ? You made me crash it ! I made you crash ? Knock it off . Knock it off ! If we 're gonna do this , we have to work as a team . We 're doing this . You don 't even want to know what we had to do to score that chum . Disgusting . How old are you , please . All right , here 's the deal . Felice and I are gonna ride on Dad 's boat ... Who 's Dad ? While Fletcher and Kaplan ride on Troy 's . Fletcher , Kaplan and I ride on Troy 's boat . No , no , no , I don 't think you want to do that , please . The boys will be in charge ... of chumming on that boat . 'Cause it 's faster ... but that also means the shark will be chasing them . The shark is chasing us ? Right , so ... Who 's Dad ? Target distance for detonation is 20 miles southwest from here . Anybody ? 20.4 miles . How did we come up with a number like that ? Captain Dad . That 's how far Coronado Island is ... and that 's where I first saw this thing . Cool . And it should be far enough away from the coast ... in case he explodes . How big of an explosion are we talking about here ? Just , you know , curious . - I don 't know , like a megaton . - Megaton ? A megaton is equivalent to a million tons of dynamite . Awesome , does anyone have SPF 9000 ? How far do we have to be when this thing blows ? About 4 miles . How fast your boat go ? 80 knots is the fastest I 've gotten her to go , so far . - The fastest . - Yup . 80 knots , that 's about two and a half minutes . That 's how long we have to get away . Yeah , we have to chum every three miles ... otherwise we may lose him . That 's why I made this . A little modification I slapped together . Flying buckets of chum . That 's great , just make sure and save it ... for when we 're on Troy 's boat . You distract him with that thing , lure it out to sea ... and we 'll haul ass back to shore . How far is your range on that thing ? It 's beefed up . I mean , I 've never flown it further than 10 miles ... but it could work . I like your confidence , Brother . It should work . It has to . Radio check . Good check . Anything ? Not yet . Chum ! Go chum ! Hey , guys ? Guys , you ready to be famous ? What do you mean ? Check out the number on the bottom of that window ? 2.3 million and change . That 's how many people are watching right now . A little help here . You mean now , as in live ? Yeah ! I wouldn 't be risking my life out here ... if everyone and their mother didn 't know about it . Yeah ! Yeah ! Please , cute-cat videos get more hits than you . That 's because cute-cat videos are like crack to people . Have you ever seen Squirrel vs. Ninja cat ? Yeah ! I love that one ! It 's so good . Compete with that ! Come on , let 's go ! You don 't know how to chum . Chum ! Chum ! Been awhile since we 've been on a boat together . Yeah . I 'm proud of you , Gina ... real proud . He 's close . We 're not even halfway there . Look alive , guys . He 's close . We 're nowhere near where we need to be yet . Tell me about it . We 're not even at four million viewers yet . That 's not what I meant . Hey , there he is ! Hey , pick it up ! He 's coming in hot . How can a shark move that fast ? We got to slow this thing down ! There 's a boat-load of oxygen tanks under the bow ! Get ' em ! What are we supposed to do with these ? Throw ' em in the sharks mouth and shoot him ! Like Jaws ? We don 't even have a gun ! Then just throw them ! What 's that gonna do ? The shark will heat the water , and they 'll explode . Like depth charges . Yeah , exactly ! It might slow it down ! Or set it off ! Atomic blast ! Remember that part ? It 's just air ! Throw ' em ! I hate this plan ! We 're doing it ! Do it ! Nothing . Throw another one ! I got another one ! Get another one in there ! Okay , this plan sucks ! Give me that thing ! You guys okay ? Yeah , we 're fine . Fletcher 's gone . We saw . Do you have his drone ? Yeah , it 's back here . Good , let 's use it to help us kill this damn thing . Do you know how to operate it ? Yeah , if I can figure out how to turn it on . There 's Coronado Island in front of us . We 're about four miles out , start chumming ! Dude ! Dude ! Let me see the radio ! Let me see the radio ! Hey , baby . Four million viewers and counting ! Seriously ? TROY Serious as a shark attack ! Damn it , I 'm missing it ! I need to get on that boat ! I need to get on that boat ! Pull next to them ! I 'm switching boats ! Felice , we have to stick to the plan . We will all be on that boat in a minute . We have to stick to the plan . Was Fletcher getting eaten part of the plan ? No , but I promise that we will all have a better chance ... of staying alive if you focus on spotting a glimmer ... in the water instead of on your 15 minutes of fame . You look fat when you 're condescending ? Bitch . What 's that ? What 's what ? Sharks ! A whole lot of them . Brace yourselves . It 's about to get bumpy ! We attracted them with the chum . Sharks incoming ! Brace yourself ! Did she say sharks , as in plural ? I think so . We don 't see anything ! We don 't see anything ! Hold on ! Come on , you sons of bitches . Son of a bitch ! Holy ... Are you seeing this , people ? Troy ! I 'm coming , Troy , buddy , hold on ! Hold on , buddy ! Troy ! Try to swim , man , come on ! Help ! Help ! Come on , come on ! Come one , you 're right , here ! Come on , come on , come on . Help . Help . Troy , come on ! Hurry ! Come on , he 's coming ! Hurry ! Come on , Troy , let 's go ! Come on , swim ! Come on ! Come on , swim ! Come on ! Come on , it 's coming ! Swim like you never swim ! Go ! Go . Kiss my ... Troy , no ! No , Troy ! Troy ? Troy ? Troy ? Can 't stop now ! We got a mile to go ! The motor 's dead . We can 't go without Troy . Where is he ? He 's gone , Felice ! What are we gonna do now ? We can 't use my boat , it 's rigged to explode ... Bow line ! We 'll have to use yours ! Toss me the bow line ! Secure that thing and float it ! All right . Time to leave , sweetheart . Just leave me here , I can 't live without him . Suit yourself . Where is she ? She 's in there , she wants to stay . What ? She can 't stay ! You go tell her that . Let 's float this around to your stern . Come on , come on . Don 't let it sink ! Felice . I 'm sorry he 's dead . It 's your fault . What the hell ? Damn it ! Wait ! Get the hell off me , Felice ! If you 'd let me on my boat , he 'd still be here ! Stay down ! Shark wants to kill me , I understand . What 's your excuse ? I don 't know what came over me . I ... I 'll still go with you , if you 'll let me . I 'm sorry . Shark ! The boat 's on fire ! Untie that bow line ! Just push off ! Come on . Dad ! Dad , no ! Dad ... Dad . Look , your dad would have wanted us to keep fighting . We 're gonna lure him to the boat , and then ... Damn it ! That probably would have worked . Is your drone working ? Well , I haven 't had a chance to get it up yet ! Well , get it up , damn it ! Go , come on ! We 're gonna die out here . We might as well save some lives while we 're at it . Yeah , sure , why not ? I 'm gonna force feed it with this . But I gotta take it as low as possible first . How ? That ! Wait , you 're gonna ride that thing ? I 'm gonna try . I gotta find the battery to this boat . Where is it ? Right here , why ? We 're gonna make sure it blows ! Shift the wire . What ? Shift the wires . Help me with this . Help me put it on . I 'm gonna go down as far as I can go . And as soon as I do ... I 'm gonna take off my oxygen tank , open it up ... and as soon as you see it come to the surface ... we 're gonna put those wires to the bolts of the battery . One to the red , one to the black . You got it ! There 's no way this is gonna work . Do you have a better idea ? Well , we could ... We could ... It 's totally gonna work . Okay . All right . So , if I can go down far enough , it 'll minimize the blast . I 'm gonna have to get in the water to start that engine . Can you ... can you fly that thing and distract it ? I 'm gonna fly that thing if it 's the last thing I do . Well , it just might be . I don 't know , Gina , this is a long shot . Well , sometimes you just have to take the long shot . Wait , what are you doing ? Did I just misread that ? Yes ! Well , no ... He 's coming back ! Okay ... Stick to the plan . Wait , wait , wait , wait ! Wait a minute , let me just get this straight . You want me to blow you up ? Yes ! Well , what about us ? We just had that ... we just had a moment ! What about you and I and the whole ... and the thing ? You and me ! Where are you going ? I love you , Gina ! That 's not good . You 're alive ! You missed it ! I missed you , too ! No , Kaplan , you ran out of cord ! Behind you ! It worked ! Just do it again , Kaplan ! Do it again ! Damn it ! Kaplan , what 's wrong ? I can 't turn this damn thing ! Come on , Kaplan , just do it again ! Swim , Gina ! Swim ! The other way ! Where are you going ? Where is she going ? Right , everyone else is dead . My turn ! Come on ! Shark , come on ! Look at me , I 'm in the water , shark ! You and me , shark ! You and me , I 'm here , damn it ! Damn it , shark ! The shark is overheating , Gina ! It 's gonna blow ! There 's more oxygen tanks in the back of the boat , I just dived . No , no , no ! No , move them to the back . What ? Put the tanks in the back of the boat , Gina ! Here , catch it . You got it ? Here . Okay , find ... find me something to knock these off with ! What ? Gotta knock these tops off ! Will this work ? Yeah , yeah . Okay , come on , come on . All right , on three ... we 're gonna whack ' em . We 're gonna whack ' em off , okay ? All right . Here we go . One , two , three ! Again ! Again ! All right , this is it ! You ready ? Go ! My god . Are you okay ? I need a minute . I need a minute . Okay . I 'm gonna throw up . Hey , Gina ... Come here .

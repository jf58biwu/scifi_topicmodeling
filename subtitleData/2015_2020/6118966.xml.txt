 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Where you can be with people like us . You can learn about yourself , your gift . My name is Jiaying . I have chosen to be your guide . Forgot I was working with " The Cavalry . " I 've heard the stories ... What went down in Bahrain . She went in , crossed off the enemy force . Didn 't say how . Did she lose anyone in there ? Herself . Mm , you 're up early . Hmm , hey , we got a family to make , And there 's only one way to do that . And I 'm dedicated to the cause . Hmm , so thoughtful . Mm . When you get back , maybe you and I can take a trip . Hmm . Somewhere warm . Mm . Focus our efforts to expand . He 's gonna be a hell-raiser . Uh , not in my house . My house has rules . Oh , so you plan on being exactly like your own mother ? Well ... With a few modifications , yes . He 's always early . Stall him . Come on in ! It 's open ! Andrew ? Good morning . Mm . You really leave your front door unlocked ? Eh , got the best security system in the world . And you 're early . This is my time . Sorry . So , who you going after ? Am I about to get a new patient ? Don 't know yet . But yeah , maybe . Hey , no leaking operational secrets . Come on , coulson . We 're gonna be late . I 'm early . Keep her safe out there . She 's supposed to keep me safe . Yeah . Hey . You be careful . I will . And when I come back , we 've got work to do . Come on . I got to go . O 'brien , thanks for the tunes . Anytime . It 's one dull flight . This really gifted individual ... What do we know ? Not much yet . You know they 're retiring this fleet ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s putting every dime into the Triskelion . Well ... Not all the dimes . Fury 's quietly started a new initiative . Instead of this catch-and-release With powered people , we form a team , Take earth 's mightiest to find out if they 're heroes . And you mention this because you want my help ? Well , I know you got the family-planning thing going on . I 'm staying in the field . Good , 'cause you 'd be great . And that way , we could keep working together . Mm-hmm . Uh , one mission at a time . Look alive . Agent hart . We 've got her , phil . Gather up ! Meet Eva Belyakov ... 35 , index candidate . Russian intelligence has been pursuing her . Agents Coulson and may have been brought in To advise and make the approach . We believe Miss Belyakov possesses enhanced strength . This is what happened when a Russian officer Tried to stop her with his car . She fled Russia unharmed . Looks pretty strong to me , So it 's important we don 't spook her . Just a friendly chat to bring her in for evaluation . And if all goes really well , We 'd gain an asset before the russians find her . The approach will be public . It 's not ideal , but we go in now , we lose our window . Local military 's not used to standing down . Welcome to Bahrain . Let 's hope Belyakov cooperates . And if she doesn 't ? Then I call in the Cavalry . Are we having any issues following Agent Fitz ? You tailed him ? He resigned . Fitz has a lot of ideas . We 're just making sure that he doesn 't get any crazy ones . Like seeking out Coulson ? We find answers where we can . Perhaps you can fill in a few of the blanks ... Specifically about powered people . What about project Deathlok ? How long has Coulson been running mike peterson ? The contact has been minimal . He wasn 't an active asset . Seems pretty active to me . Do you expect us to believe he 's not part of theta protocol ? You can at least tell us what you do know about it . Coulson doesn 't bore me with the details Of every little operation . May , we know this is massive . We have evidence that coulson has quietly been moving Alarming amounts of resources and manpower all over the globe . The only thing we found linking all these activities Is a code name ... Theta protocol . There 's no more details he shared with you ? Any director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Has secrets . We 're not talking a few black-bag operations . Take your entire current budget And match it with this one program . That 's why we want to open fury 's toolbox ... for answers . And I 'm sure there 's a simple one . Let me take charge of my base And I 'll talk coulson in peacefully . That 's great . But so we 're on the same page , all our intel on coulson . You know him best . Tell us ... Are we right to worry ? I know coulson 's not our enemy . I want to know where you 're from . Did you make friends there ? At S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Yeah . They 're like family . Or they were . Until you changed ? They sent agents after you . I don 't know what happened . I know I impaled a guy . Who shot at you . No . I lost control . Do you understand your gift ? I ... Make things shake ? Well , not really . Everything 's shaking already , Vibrating at its own natural frequency . This stone , the wood in the trees ... I believe you can learn to sense those frequencies around you And resonate with them so that not everything is shaking , Only what you choose . Sense a frequency . How do I do that ? I 'm not the one with the gift . I just work here . You think I can hear the stone ? Whoa . You 've got to be kidding me . Can you hear it ? No , not the stone . The mountain . It 's the loudest thing here . Well , now take that frequency and see if you can amplify it . The last time I did something like this , You can 't hurt the mountain , and you 're not gonna hurt me . Don 't be afraid . I moved a mountain . Remember that feeling . It 's not something to be afraid of . Faisal Ahmed , may I introduce Agents Coulson and May . Faisal is with Bahrain national security . Pleasure , sir . Your people have been tracking her ? Yes , we followed miss Belyakov to a caf√© in this market . This is a very dangerous area . Black-market importers , thieves ... Not a place for tourists . So she didn 't come for Falafel . She could be meeting with anyone . Whatever she wants , it 's not good . Unless she leave with you , our military will take her . This is our window . Fury will have our asses If an index candidate ends up in government hands . Okay . We 'll make this work . Hello . May I ? My name is Phil Coulson , and I 'm here to help . My group specializes In helping people like you , who have gifts . And why should I trust you ? Because I could take you somewhere safe . I know you 've been on the run , But S.H.I.E.L.D. Can protect you . You 're not alone in all of this . Locals incoming . Gun . Blue shirt . Agent O 'brien . Why don 't we go somewhere more secure ? Hey . How 's it going ? No . I like it here . Coulson , we 're running out of time . These men can 't help you . Let 's talk somewhere calmer . What is it you 're looking for ? Pain . Take it easy . Drop your weapons now . Easy ! Step back ! Drop the damn gun . No ! Easy . Let her go . Just put the girl down . I 'll come with you . Let my men go . We can all walk away from this . Stand back ! Do not follow us ! Eat like crazy , then rest up . This afternoon will be much harder . Than the avalanche ? Now I need to take care of something else . I 'm very proud of your work today . Wow . Training go that well or that badly ? I caused an avalanche . Is that a good thing ? Yeah , it 's good . You know , it 's really impressive For Jiaying to take anyone under her wing . Yeah ? Yeah . I like her . I just ... I can 't ... What 's her role here ? Her role is in charge . So really , she must like you . What kind of contraband you got there ? I-I knew you 'd be training . Hey , Lincoln ? If she 's in charge , how often does she train people ? Since I 've been here , let me see ... Never . Saw the look on your face when we mentioned Mike Peterson . Tell me if I 'm wrong , but ... Coulson didn 't just keep The specifics of theta protocol from you . I get the feeling that until we said it , You 'd never heard it before . That gut punch that you felt today ... That 's how we felt for months . I swore to build S.H.I.E.L.D. Back up the right way , And I don 't think Coulson 's a bad guy . But a secret as big as Theta protocol ... I can 't ignore that . Whatever he 's doing , It needs to be out in the light of day . You 're worried that I don 't understand your choice . Well , sometimes that 's the price of doing the right thing . No one will understand , and it hurts like hell . The warehouse connects directly to the market . Once they holed up inside , my men cut off both exits ... The alley and the market entrance . It 's a rat 's nest in there . Coulson , we I.D. ' d Belyakov 's friends ... Local Militia street gang , basically . That 's there stronghold . Okay , I 'm gonna call Agent O 'brien , See if they 'll negotiate . O 'brien , is that you ? You okay ? Leave us alone . Can you talk ? Are they making demands ? Put me on with Belyakov . Just leave us alone . " Leave us alone " ? Is he trying to warn us away , or ... We tried it the nice way . It 's time for my team to do its job . Let 's move out ! I should go in . Now we find out what kind of monster we 're dealing with . Easy . This will help . Unless you 're removing them , you 're not helping at all . Once your gifts have revealed themselves , We will train you how to use them . I don 't want to train . I want to leave . My only gift is to be the scary monster under the bed . You are not a monster . I can 't even look in the mirror . My days are a pain . Every night , I 'm assaulted by constant nightmares . You 'll get through this . Stay out of it , spark plug . Don 't get so wrapped up in your physical changes That you miss out on the gifts layered below . It 's a tough change . What do you know about changes ? Let her vent a little . I 've been through this . It 's hard , but I promise Our care is the best thing for you right now . I 'm tired of being caged . I want to feel fresh air . We 'll discuss it later . He means well . You know , I might have something to help you sleep . Sleep is easy . It 's the relentless nightmares . I 'm always being hunted like an animal , Tangled in thorns . Or I dream of Skye ... Skye and her father at dinner , Champagne , a bouquet of daisies . And she 's so ... Happy . She got everything , and I got thorns . I know this seems impossible , But ... Don 't give up on us yet . In position . Thermal 's showing minimal activity . - Alpha set up . - Bravo , good to go . All teams , this is Alpha . Go for breach . Back entrance secure , moving upstairs . Contact ... Southwest corner ! Bravo , check in . We 're taking hits downstairs ! We 've got civilians here . I see the little girl . She 's alive . Friendly fire ! Friendly fire ! All agents , disengage . Disengage . Hart , come in . Bravo , come in . All operators , check in . What was that ? Were they taken out ? Did they take themselves out ? What about the little girl ? I don 't know , but I have to call it in . That building just swallowed 12 agents in a minute . We 're alone on this . Okay . I play a note ... You hold it . Okay . Your gift is quite destructive , But look at the music you can make . That was amazing . So what ? We 'll drink from wooden cups at dinner . What 's wrong ? Nothing . That 's just it . Everything is great here . It feels like home , which ... Never ends well . Ends ? We 're not going anywhere . You sure ? ' cause mistrust of home is my other superpower . Where is this coming from ? Nothing . It 's stupid . I broke a crystal decanter once at a foster family 's house , And now the glass , and ... They sent you back for that ? Well , I tried some of the scotch , too . But , yes , something bad happens Every time I feel settled somewhere . I 'm 25 , and I have never spent more than two years anywhere . The second I made friends at the orphanage ... gone . And god forbid I called a foster family " home . " It 's " pack your bags . " I got the news on my birthday once , Because I don 't even know when I was born . I 'm so sorry . S.H.I.E.L.D. Was the closest I ever came to having a family . I belonged there , saw what I could be . Even that ended with agents hunting me through the woods . We 're not gonna turn on you or abandon you . This is a safe place . See , you say that , But I know you 're not being straight with me . Why do you care if I stay or go , and why are you trea ... July 2nd . You were born on July 2nd . It was , um , a hot night , and , for some reason , I decided to clean the house before I woke your father . Oh , my god . He said you didn 't age . Cal ... he , uh ... He ran over to the neighbor 's house To borrow their car but didn 't speak any Chinese . So , um ... It was a mess . It 's you . You 're my ... Deep down , I think you knew . I was too afraid to hope . Are you okay ? I wanted to run to you the second I saw you , Wrap you in my arms . Why didn 't you ? Because you were forced into going through the mist . Joining our people had to be your choice . You deserved that . At st . Agnes , all the kids pray That their parents are out there , looking for them . You were . For years . After your father pieced me back together , We scoured the earth . We were ruthless in hunting for you . One morning , I woke up , and I barely recognized myself . Your father was buried in the new , horrible man he had become . He couldn 't admit that our baby was gone . I thought I had to accept it . I 'm so sorry . My sweet angel . I thought if I couldn 't find you , Maybe I could help protect others , So I came here . I 'll make up for all of it . I swear . But listen . Right now , this has to be our secret . What do you mean , " secret " ? Why ? Our people have very strict rules , And they could perceive you as a threat . Simmons . Ah , May ! Mm . Thank god you 're back . Everybody keeps leaving . They weren 't too harsh on that awful ship ? No , they were very fair . In fact , they gave me command of the base . It means that if our team makes contact , I answer the call . And it means we 've got work to do . Were you aware that you 've been working On Deathlok technology ? Oh , no , you 're mistaken . That 's the design for a hybrid capacitor . No . It 's Deathlok 's supercharged battery pack , And it may not be the only thing he kept from us . Did Coulson ever talk to you About a project named theta protocol ? May , I have no idea what that is . Is that why they took Coulson down ? Then what can I do ? We need to find out if they 're telling the truth . I 've been through a lot with Coulson . He doesn 't go off the reservation Without a good reason . There are multiple hostages ... Our whole damn Tactical Team . We need emergency backup 10 minutes ago . Tell them to send me in . I can fix the problem . I strongly advise sending our specialist inside ... Agent May . No . There are agents inside . There 's no time to wait . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . Yay for red tape . They want us to wait . For how long ? The Bahrainis are pissed . From bombing the building and calling it a night . If they go in , it 's gonna be an assault . People will die . I can do this . It 's all about slipping in and pulling them out . S.H.I.E.L.D. Is not authorized for any action . Go . Oh , what are we saying this time ? Nuclear ? Bio ? Eh , bio always works . My name is Phil Coulson . I represent the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division , And you are about to enter a quarantine site . Colonel , you can 't send your men in there ! A biological weapon was set off ! Nasty stuff ... Flesh-eating . Weapons sale gone bad with the Russians . Give my team time to assess . Did you say , " Biological Weapon " ? Yes , I did . We 're going off book here ... Hostage situation , Our guys inside . You 're going in alone ? Babe . Drew , they have a little girl . Okay . You 've done this before . You always come home . Hey ... She 's gonna be scared . Take a knee . Get down to her level . It 'll help . If not , then just grab her and run like hell . Thanks . Do good , melinda , but come home . I love you . Love you , too . Coulson , you read ? Agent Hart . Hart , it 's Agent May . We need to go now . It 's dangerous out there . Are you okay ? No . I need your pain . What the hell are you doing , sir ? We have to go . I need your pain . I need your pain . I need your pain . I need your pain . I need your pain . Belyakov is controlling you . Hart , that woman is controlling you . I want your pain . I 've got to take her out . If we keep digging I 'm afraid of what we 're going to find . Coulson 's reported trips . Cross-referenced it with Bobbi 's intel . Most were covers . If he said London , he was meeting in Milan Or Belgrade , Cairo , buying god knows what . My findings aren 't much better . Evidence of construction . I can 't even count the shell companies . Coulson 's burning through money . Bobbi wasn 't lying , May . It 's a whole other life . And , um ... What is it ? Coulson met with your ex-husband . They 've been consulting for a while . Okay . Put it on the map . What 's coulson even need with 100 bunk beds ? We think he 's building another base , for powered people . In my opinion , Coulson 's determined to explore people with powers . He 's been on the front lines of it his whole career ... Avengers Initiative , Tahiti . Everything he 's done since restarting S.H.I.E.L.D. Tells me he 's continuing that work . He wouldn 't . Why blow up the alien city ? Well , why go there at all ? But if you 're planning on training superpowered people , You 're gonna need a lot of bunks and scientists and money . And you 're definitely gonna find a very good psychologist . Simmons , I need you to get me into Fury 's toolbox . Coulson could have good reason for keeping this quiet . Open the box . Best intentions aside , Underestimating powers is playing with fire . Am I free to go ? Skye had a choice . Are you telling me I can 't leave ? No . I 'm telling you ... I can never leave . I can take you to beautiful places ... Pyramids by moonlight , an island untouched by man . But it is too dangerous in public right now . You don 't know that . I 'm a survivor . I know you are . And you 're too good to pity yourself . I know isolation , pain . Think this face didn 't take some getting used to ? You can teleport . That 's amazing . But first , I was blind , lost in the world . These gifts are deeply layered for people like us . Now I can go anywhere ... Find our people . Well , what was the good in finding me ? If I have a use , I don 't know it . Yet . I will be your guide . Your beauty will be reflected in a wonderful gift . People like us have to live differently , But it doesn 't mean it can 't be an amazing world . As long as I have you to show it to me . Ethan . Hey . I hear you 're headed away . Uh , yeah . Taking some time to backpack . Gordon 's dropping me off in prague , so ... Well , have a good trip . Thanks . There are good people here . He hasn 't been through the mist yet . You don 't want to tell them Because you 're responsible for deciding what to do with me . It 's complicated . Come with me . I 'm responsible for everyone here . Favoritism undermines trust . Don 't you want to tell people ? I don 't get that luxury . My rules must be enforced . People have died when the process For selection and training has been ignored . But I already skipped that process . And I protected you from the swift response That usually brings . It 's happened before . There was a woman once . She didn 't trust my judgment So she stole a batch of terrigen crystals and fled Got caught up with some criminals in Bahrain . Her name was Eva ... Russian , strong-willed like you . I will feel your pain . I feel all their pain . And I grow stronger . May . The C ... The Cavalry . I know this story . A-an agent went in and ... Killed her ? I wish it had been that simple . Stay back , honey . I 'll get you out of here . It 's gonna be all right . I 've had their pain . Now give me yours . Come on . I 've got plenty to share . Eva was bound to be noticed out in the world . Feel enough pain yet ? Let everyone go , and this can end . No . I want more . She 's dead . Snap out of it . I like the pain . She didn 't steal the crystals for herself . She stole them for her daughter , Katya . I saw a darkness in the girl . I didn 't think she should go through the mist , But eva wanted katya to receive her birthright . She trusted her judgment over mine . You killed mother . And now there is so much pain . I like all their pain . I 'm scared . I want to leave . Please , take my hand . Katya was too young . She went insane . With one touch , she leeched off emotions like a parasite . No . Not them . Let them go . We can fix you . We can help . Just don 't . Take my hand . Give me your pain . I need a new mother . I 'll take your pain . Stop . Don 't ... just put your hand down and stop . Everything 's gonna be all right . Go , go . Katya had to be stopped , but not by S.H.I.E.L.D. She was my responsibility . Now you 're afraid they 'll think you broke them for me . Our people know too well What a woman will do for her daughter . So ... We keep our secret . No one will ever know . Did you see that move ? How did she take out that many people ? I must have been knocked out . I-I can 't remember anything . Had to have been 30 guys . But got our whole team out . The Cavalry went in after all . Hey , every agent who walked out of that building Is alive because of you . The girl . I-I couldn 't save her . I ... She didn 't understand . I tried . It 's all right . You have to let the girl go , Melinda . Let the girl go . Okay . Okay . We 'll get through this . Are you sure it 's the right thing ? If this is some weird lesson ... It 's not a lesson . This is personal ... A debt I owe to your father . And if you trust me in this , I 'll be eternally grateful . He 's a monster . He was good once . Cal lost himself to a promise he made me out of love . Now he 's made good . That shouldn 't mean all is forgiven . No . But he never gave up on you . He deserves something for that . Just one dinner , Then you never have to see him again . I 'll have him taken away from here . You promise ? Oh . I had wanted so badly to make everything perfect for tonight . And suddenly , it is . Uh these are for you . I want to thank you ... Both of you ... For giving me another shot . I know that my actions ... I learned who my mother was today , And she ... Taught me things . I 've never had that before . That was possible because of you . That 's all I really wanted for you . Cal , uh , Skye doesn 't know when her birthday is . I do . July 2nd . It ... it was a gorgeous summer night ... Beautiful , big moon in the sky . 1988 . Huh ? Do you know , your mother ... She actually cleaned before she told me . You see , there was only one car in the village ... And we didn 't own it . So I had to negotiate with the man . He didn 't speak english , and my chinese was terrible . Wait . ' 88 ? Mm-hmm . I 'm 26 ? That 's so messed up . Uh , sorry . Uh , to ... 26 . Yes . Here 's to 26 . To 26 . Mmm . Anyway , once we figured out the car situation ... I dream of Skye and her father at dinner ... Bouquet of daisies . And she 's so ... Happy . Then we had to get you to the hospital . Your mother was all fine and calm . I , of course , was ... It 's not a dream . We 'll return in a moment . It 's been 20 minutes . Sure there 's no window in there ? All right . Hey , buddy , you gonna be all day in there ? Just a minute ! Geez , let a man think in peace . Whoa . Uh ... Hunter ! How did you ring Coulson 's tablet ? Where ... are you watching Mexican football ? Uh , undisclosed secure location ? Fitz ? How did you open Fury 's toolbox ? Don 't worry . It 's safe . I stole it first . You stole it ? Yeah . Fitz , you 're amazing . Can we meet up ? Uh ... I 'm being followed . They won 't grab me . I think they 're hoping I 'll lead them to you first . The thing is , would it still be okay Maybe you could show me how to shake a tail . Maybe you could start , like , now ? You in a bathroom ? With one of those electric hand dryers ? Oh , yes . You 're gonna be okay , mate .

 Subtitle created by : ; = = = € h ☼ ¥ ) " The Hunger Games : Mockingjay - Part 2 ( 2015 ) " ( Run time 02 : 05 : 14 ) Okay . Okay . I know , I know . I 'm sorry , I know it 's a little tender . Okay . Let 's try your voice now . My name is Katniss Everdeen , I 'm from District 12 . My ... Okay , take your time . You got a lot of swelling in your vocal chords . My ... name ... is ... Katniss Everdeen . I want ... I want to talk to him . He needs time . But ... We 're trying something new today . He 's been calmer with the doctors , but ... They are strangers to him , so ... We 're gonna test his responses on someone he remembers from home . Someone he trust . Send her in . Hey . Prim . - How 're you doing ? - She 's too close . - It 's okay . - How did you get here ? We 're in District 13 now . It 's a real place . The stories are true . You were rescued . My family hasn 't come to see me . There was an attack on 12 . Yes . My family . They didn 't survive . Because of Katniss . - It 's because of Katniss . - It wasn 't because of her . - She tell you to say that . - She didn 't tell me anything . She 's a liar , Prim . It 's the truth . Yeah . What you 're saying isn 't real . She sent you here to talk to me . - She knows you 're here now . It 's okay . She knows . You can 't trust her ! She 's a monster ! She 's a mutt ! The Capitol bring her to destroy us ! Get her out of there . Do you understand me ! You have to kill her , Prim ! You have ... to kill her ! - Katniss . - She 's a mutt ! - This is just the condition responds . - Kill her ! - It 's not him . - She 's a monster ! - She 's a mutt ! - No , it 's not him . She 's a mutt ! Please , come in . Will you excuse us ? - For just a moment . - Of course . Have a seat . I 'm glad you 're feeling better . Snow has to pay for what he 's done . I want to help the rebels in any way I can . It 's hard to see Peeta this way . That 's not Peeta . Send me to the Capitol . I 'll do anything . I can 't . I can 't send you there . We can 't get into the Capitol until we control District 2 . Then send me to 2 . You want me to fire up our troops . Call out to the loyalists , You 've seen what I can do . Yes , I have . I saw Peeta before we left . What 'd you think ? Something selfish . That you don 't have to be jealous of him anymore ? No . I don 't stand a chance if he doesn 't get better . You 'll never let him go . What 's going on in your head ? I don 't know . It 's like kissing someone who 's drunk . It doesn 't count . 3 minutes before touch down . Prepare for landing . Wrap it up . Last chance . Go . This is another version food trapping resource . This one is designed to blind , the smoke clings to the eyes . That 's an application for Hummingbird trap . They 're scared of people , so they flee in this direction to what they think is a safe haven . Two tier explosion . We 'll have people enough time to rush in and help the wounded . A second bomb . Right . Second one goes off here . I guess there are no rules anymore about what a person can do to another person . I don 't think some of us use any rule book when we hijacked Peeta . Welcome to District 2 . I 'm Corporal Homes . If you 'll follow me , please . Don 't worry . That 's how the loyals say good morning . President Coin , we 're indebted to you for the reinforcements and the Mockingjay . But I 'm not sure that anyone outside of 2 knows what we 've been up against . This is the Nut . The Capitol 's headquarters for our offensive operations . It 's manned by both military and civilian personnel from District 2 . As you can see , the fortress lies so far beneath the bedrock , it 's untouchable . Yesterday , we attempted to take the northeastern gate . Then we encountered from higher up and we 're forced to pull back . We took heavy loses . Could we create a decoy ? Send troops towards one of the gate and just send an attack on another . Well , who 's troops do you propose as a decoy , Commander . We have the Mockingjay . Don 't underestimate her . We could use her to erode support . She maybe be able to sway some of the loyalists . You 've been underground a long time , Madam Coin . This isn 't like the rest of Panem Support for the Capitol runs deep here . Then there 's no sacrifice is too great . We need to control the arsenal inside that fortress . Even with every District and it 's alliance , we are outgunned . I won 't commit my people to a ground assault , just to pillage weapons . Commander Paylor . Your people , have suffered more than just as anyone else in the hands of the Capitol . Which is why I won 't condone a mass suicide . If we don 't take District 2 , we won 't get in to the Capitol . We 'll be enough to disable the fortress , instead of taking it . What do you have in mind ? We think of it like a wolf den . You 're not going to fight your way in , so you got two choices . You trap the wolves inside or you flush them out . We can 't attack straight on . Couldn 't we use a hovercraft to strike around it ? We use the mountains , we have weak spots and peaks . We could design the bomb to target some sequence season seismic data . Trigger avalanches . Block all exits , cut off their supplies . You make it impossible for them to launch their hovercraft . Bury them alive . We forfeit any chance to control the weapons . Yes , but we 'd place a weaken in Capitol . There 're civilians in there . They should be given a chance to surrender . Use one of the supply tunnels for the evacuees That 's a luxury we weren 't given when they fire-bombed 12 . There 's got to be a better way . I suggest we try the avalanche but leave the train tunnel alone . Civilians can escape into the square where our armies will be waiting for their surrender . We should have every available medic standing by . And if they won 't surrender ? Then we will need a compelling voice to persuade them . What 's the difference , Katniss . Crushing the enemy alive or blown them out of the sky with one of Beetee 's arrows , it 's the same thing . We were under attack in District 8 . And that hovercraft wasn 't filled with civilians . It doesn 't matter . Even those civilians are just mopping floors , they 're helping the enemy . If they have to die , I can live with that . No one who supports the Capitol is innocent . With that kind of thinking you can kill whoever you want . You can send kids off to the Hunger games to keep the Districts in line . It 's war , Katniss . Sometimes killing isn 't personal . Figure if anyone who knew that it was you . I , of all people know that it 's always personal . Don 't worry , Katniss . There will be survivors . Let 's focus on what it is you got to say . - Now , Plutarch wrote a speech ... - I 'm not saying that . Okay , I didn 't think so . Just ... Just remember you 're talking to everybody . And not just the rebels , but the Capitol and the survivors into want them to lay down their arms . So , you might want to experiment with a little sensitivity and warmth . Make it quick , you 're exposed . This is Katniss Everdeen , speaking to all of the loyalist from the heart of District 2 . Survivors . Inbound ! Ready ! Ready ! Guns up ! Arms are ready ! Guns up ! We got to get you back . Here they come ! Everybody , stand back ! Everybody , go ! - On the ground ! - Get them off the train ! Put your weapons down . Get on the ground ! Put your weapons down , now ! Weapons down . You , put it down . - Put it ... Put your weapons down ! - Drop it Drop your weapon ! You , drop it ! Drop the gun ! Drop it ! - Hold your fire . - Stop ! Stop ! - Hold your fire ! - Stop ! Hold your fire ! - He needs help ! - Hold your fire ! Drop it . Give me one reason I shouldn 't shoot you . Drop the gun ! I can 't . I guess that 's the problem , isn 't it ? We blew up your mine . You burned my district to the ground . We each have every reason to want to kill each other . So , if you want to kill me , do it . Make someone happy . I 'm tired of killing slaves for him . I 'm not a slave . I am . That 's why I killed Cato ... and he killed Thresh ... and Thresh killed Clove . It just goes around and around , and who wins ? Always Snow . I 'm done being a piece in his Game . District 12 , District 2 we have no fight . Except the one the Capitol gave us . Why are you fighting the rebels ? Your neighbors ? Your family ? These people are not your enemy ! We all have all one enemy . And that 's Snow . He corrupts everyone and everything . He turns the best of us against each other . Stop killing for him ! Tonight , turn your weapons to the Capitol . Turn you weapons to Snow . Tonight , turn your weapons to the Capitol . Turn you weapons to Snow . Hold you fire ! A toast . Antonius . With our best troops crushed in the mountains and the rebels marching on us as we speak . What do we celebrate ? The death of the Mockingjay , Sir . If Peeta didn 't kill her , her own arrogance did . Of course . That 's the same facile thinking that led you to divert our best peacekeepers into District 2 . You have the habit of burying people before they are dead . If the Mockingjay were gone , the rebels would already be using her as a martyr . No , Minister Antonius . I 'm afraid that is not what we were toasting at all . Sir . The rebels can be held off out ... The rebels will reach the outskirts of the Capitol in a matter of days . We 'll evacuate the outer blocks ... to let them in . I want all anti-aircraft defenses ready , so we 're secured from the skies . Lure them into the city and then our gamemakers will make them pay for every inch with blood . I want every camera watching . We will turn their advance into a celebration of suffering . Let each moment be captured for all posterity . So ... What do we toast tonight , Minister Antonius ? We toast to the glorious era coming to it 's bitter end . Well , there she is . The Mockingjay . Oh , that speech you gave . Oh , man , the feel . I mean I still have goose bumps . You don 't mind , do you ? They cut off my supply of morphine . This head doctor that comes in and sees me everyday , she tried to ... help me adjust to reality like some ... Some guy from this rabbit warren actually knows anything about my reality . At least 20 times in a session he tells me that I 'm totally safe . Safe from the Capitol . Safe from Snow . What about you , Mockingjay ? You feeling totally safe ? Till I got shot . Oh , please . The bullet didn 't even touched you . Something they thought about . Of course your costume would be bulletproof . So , what are your injuries ? Bruised ribs . Bruised lung . I 'm surprised they haven 't found you a new lung . Well , I got 2 , do you want one of mine ? I mean , it 's everybody 's job to keep you alive . Is that why you hate me ? Partly . You 're also a little hard to swallow . The whole tacky romance drama and the defender-of-the-helpless act . Even though it 's not an act . Which makes you even more unbearable . Feel free to take any of this personally . You should have been the Mockingjay , nobody has to tell you what to say . But nobody likes me . They 're afraid of you . Maybe here , but ... In the Capitol , you 're the only thing they 're scared of . It 's just stuff my family brought . This from Peeta ? Yeah . He messed us up pretty good , didn 't they ? We showed him footage of your speech in 2 ( District 2 ) . He had real memories of you . That still doesn 't mean I am going in there . He 's strapped down . He can 't hurt you . No , This is different . Haymitch , I really don 't want to . Well , it doesn 't matter what you want . It 's for Peeta . What 's the harm in trying . I watched you die . - You look terrible . - You looked better . You 're not remotely nice to say that to me now . I was never the nice one , you were . When I saw you die , I remembered something . About the bread . I remember , you in the rain . And I burned it on purpose , to give it to you . I remember , my mother hitting me . I was supposed to give it to the pig . That was the first I 've eaten in days . How did I take a beating like that for you ? Because you are kind ... and generous . - And people said you loved me . - Did people say you loved me ? They said that 's why Snow tortured you . To hurt me . Snow says everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie . All I know is that I would have saved myself a lot of suffering . If I had just given that bread to the pig . I think the only thing left to say is thank you . I need to be in the Capitol . No , you 've done your job . You 've been very successful as the Mockingjay , you 've unified the Districts . And now we want you to rest and to heal . The last of rebels saw me , I was lying on the ground . Katniss , we won 't let this momentum go to waste . We will shoot more propos , right here in 13 . Showing them that you 're alive . I should be with the troops . It will be like being on the front line . As far as the soldiers know , you survived a bullet to the heart . I think they will understand why you 're not with them . When we win this war , we 'll fly you in for the surrender . We 'll need you for the ceremony . You are very valuable to us . I 'll do whatever you need me to do . From this day forward , in sickness and in health , for richer or poorer , I promise to love and cherish you each day . I , Finnick Odair . Take you , Annie Cresta as my wife from this day forward , together or apart , we will always be united . One life . One purpose . One destiny . You may kiss the bride . You saw Peeta , didn 't you ? Would you tell him hi for me ? We 're old friends , you know . We had a joint in the cells in the Capitol , we 're very familiar with each other 's screams . I 'm going to kill Snow . Nothing good is safe while he 's alive . And I can 't make another speech about it . No more cameras . No more propos . No more games . He needs to see my eyes when I kill him . Now you 're talking . Find a way to the Capitol when everyone is looking the other way . I heard the medics talking , they 're shipping supplies to the front line from Hanger 2 around midnight , tonight . Medicine , painkillers I was gonna go steal some for myself , but I guess I couldn 't . just stay here and cover for you . Anybody can kill anybody , Katniss , even the president . You just have to be willing to sacrifice yourself . Go on . Don 't you want Snow to see you dance ? Hey , it 's her . It 's Katniss Everdeen . Hey . - I thought you were in the hospital . - I was . Come on . What is she doing ? Well , it 's so frustrating when she goes rogue . This isn 't just about a lesson , it 's insubordination . Bring her on the first hovercraft back . Don 't be ridiculous , she can 't come back now . She 's mythic . At the front line , surviving a gun shot wound ... I couldn 't stage it better myself . No . She 's going to stay where she is . And whatever she 's doing , we conceived it . It was our plan all along . Of course it was . Mr. Heavensbee . You are the gamemaker . I want everyone to know whatever game she 's playing . She 's playing for us . I 'm commander Paylor of District 8 . I 'm a soldier like all of you , so ... Here 's what I know . For the first time in our lifetimes , we 're standing together with 13 districts . From what I see here , we 've already made history . But history doesn 't stop to celebrate . And we 're facing an enemy that will not change and will never surrender . President Snow has pulled back peacekeepers to fortify the center of the city . He 's evacuating residents from the outer blocks . The civilians will be confused and desperate . You are under orders not to target them . We are deploying medical brigades to help anyone in need . We 'll show the Capitol people who we are . To slow our advance , President Snow is building a minefield of traps . And lethal devices called " Pods " . The sadistic inventions of gamemakers meant to make sport of our deaths . If our armies make it pass peacekeepers and other defenses , we 'll converge in the center of the city at Snow 's mansion Where we won 't just unlock his gates , but unshackle all of Panem . - Yeah ! - Yeah ! If we die ... Let it be for a cause and not a spectacle . If we succeed , let it be for all of Panem and let it be forever . Yes , you already made history . But the future ... Our future starts tomorrow at dawn . When we march together into the Capitol . Squad 451 ? Looks like you got your meals covered . - I 'm trying to be prepared . - Don 't lie to me . We 've been hunting together all our lives . I know when you 're going to go off on your own . You 're gonna leave me behind too ? As your fellow soldier , I suggest that you stay with your unit . I couldn 't stop you if you wanted to come . Hawthorne . Everdeen . Come meet your new unit . I 'm Lieutenant Jackson . And I want to introduce you to your squad . This is the second lieutenant Mitchell . The best sharp shooter in Panem . These are the Leeg sisters , First Combat Division . And this is Corporal Holmes . Finnick ? - Are you with us ? - Looks like it . That 's a short honeymoon . Yeah . Well ... I guess we got to have one in the Capitol . - After we take it . - Gather around . Squadron 451 . You 're my unit . Lieutenant Jackson is my second in command . Each one of you is elite in some form of combat . But we are a non-combat unit , so , we 'll be following a days behind the front line troops . You are to be the onscreen faces of the invasion . The Star squad . It 's been decided that you are most effective when seen by the masses . So , we 're not going to fight ? You do whatever you are ordered to do , soldiers . It 's not your job to ask questions . Yes , sir . Our instructions are to shoot propaganda footage on the battle scars troop to the Capitol . You are handpicked to intimidate their forces . And inspire surrenders . Even though we 'll be working on abandon streets miles behind the front line , I guarantee you , whatever they put us , it would not be safe . This is a war zone . It is likely that we 'll encounter both active Pods and peacekeepers . You 're considered high value targets to the Capitol . In the event of capture , you 'll be given a nightlock pill . A poison that acts immediately . Lieutenant Jackson do the honors . I 've already briefed you on the Pods . I remind you , they are on every block . Our unit has been given a HOLO . A database that contain the detailed map of the Capitol and the list of every known Pod . These Pods , can trigger anything from bombs , to traps , to mutts . We cannot move without this device . There 's no guarantee that our database is complete . There can be new Pods that we are not aware of . Because we don 't want the gamemakers to know we have this Intel . There 's a self-destruct on it You flip this switch . You say , " nightlock " 3 times it blows itself in anything within a 10 foot radius . Stay within our unit . Even with the HOLO , it 's likely that new Pods have been set . Whatever they contain , they are meant to kill you . Ladies and gentlemen . Welcome to the 76th Hunger Games . I 've never seen this place so empty . Just keep your eyes open . We got a Pod .. Stay cover . Shoot through those 2 buildings . Pollux . Right here . Castor . Good . When you 're ready , Katniss . Hold it . Pod is tighter . Okay . All clear . I don 't think we can get across this minefield . Not without that HOLO . We 're not getting to get it off him while he 's awake Make sure we 're on the same watch tonight . Is that peacekeepers ? 451 to Base . We got a truck coming in from the south , over . Copy that , over . Stand down everyone , it 's Bradly . My name is Peeta Mellark . I 'm with District 12 . My name is Peeta Mellark . I 'm with District 12 . Okay , stop . Hold up . Everyone relax . What are we doing ? Jackson , cuff him . Soldier , this is just a precaution , until we can get everything straighten out , yeah . Yeah . My name is Peeta Mellark , from District 12 . They want us to add him to the propo . To show he 's on our side now . We 'll move forward a few blocks tomorrow and shoot a new footage . He 's not in control of himself . I say we schedule an around the clock watch on him . The Leegs till 1700 . Homes and Mitchell till 1900 . Give me a watch . If it ever came down to it , you think you can shoot him ? I wouldn 't be shooting Peeta . I 'd be killing a Capitol mutt . I 'm not sure that kind of comment recommends you for the job either , soldier . Put her in the rotation . He 's gonna try to kill me . Especially with all this going on . It 's going to set him off . We 'll keep him contained . Why would Coin do this ? Here 's all I know . It was Peeta that she wanted rescued from the arena . She never liked you . She doesn 't like anybody or anything she can 't control . So , she would put my life in danger ? She denied , but ... What ? One way or another this war is gonna to come to an end . They promised a free election . Maybe she 's starting to see you as a threat . Nobody would think I 'd be a leader . But you 'll throw support to someone , would it be her ? If your immediate answer isn 't yes , then you 're dangerous . She doesn 't need you as a rallying cry any more these propos can be done without you . Only one thing you could do now to add more fire to this rebellion . Die . That 's not gonna happen under my watch , Katniss . I 'm planning for you to have a long life . Why ? You don 't owe me anything . Because you 've earned it . We 've been here before , you know ? What ? That look . I 've seen that look . You 're trying to decide whether or not you should kill me . I never wanted to kill you . That 's not what I 'm doing . I saw it with my own eyes . In the first games . In the first games , I thought you were trying to help the Careers to kill me . After that , I always saw you ... as an ally . Friend . Lover Victor . Fiancé . Enemy Target . Mutt . And now ally ? Yeah . I 'll add it to the list of words I use to try to figure you out . I 'm sorry . I just can 't tell what 's real and what 's made up anymore . Then ask . That 's what Annie does . Ask who ? Us . We 're your new unit now . Your favorite color is green . Is that 's real ? Yeah . It 's real . Yours is orange . Not ... bright orange . Soft like the sunset . Thank you . You 're a painter . You 're a baker . You always sleep with the windows open . You never take sugar in your tea . You always double-knot your shoelaces . You were right . I can 't do this . I guess we 're not leaving anymore . We 're not going anywhere without that HOLO . Listen up . The mag 's empty . It 's only for the propo . Let 's move . We 're heading 5 blocks north . To the Citizens in the Capitol . Our war is not with you . To the Citizens in the Capitol . Our war is not with you . You will be a vital part of the democracy that follows our victory . Be a vital part of the democracy that follows our victory . - You got it . - Okay . Boggs . This is a good spot . Through there , in the courtyard . Okay , let us clear it . Got a Pod . Split . Take cover Stay back . All clear . Gale , Holmes , with me . Leegs , take the wings . Everdeen , no ! - Boggs ! - Hold your position . Boggs ! It 's okay . The HOLO . The HOLO . Unfit for command . Transfer primary security clearance . - Say your name . - Katniss Everdeen . - What did you just do ? - Katniss . Don 't trust them . Kill Peeta if you have to . Do what you came to do . Boggs ? Come on . Come on . He 's gone . He 's gone . Go ! Go ! Go ! Now ! Now ! - This way . - Keep moving ! Katniss , go soldier ! Get to higher ground . Now ! Finnick ! Peeta ! - Let 's go ! - Oh God ! Come on . Come on . ... . Come on . Don 't stop , let 's go ! Come on ! Come on ! We got to move ! Get inside . Everybody inside ! Go ! Upstairs ! Go ! - Hurry up ! - Move ! - Go ! Go ! - Move ! Keep moving . Keep moving to the top . Go ! Hey . Hey . I got you . Shh ... It 's slowing down . Gamemakers are still putting on quite a show . - 451 to Base , over . - Hey , we better move . If peacekeepers didn 't know where we were , they do now . Those surveillance cameras caught us . 451 to Base , come in . This is a bad spot . We need to move , now . 451 to Base , over . I can 't get a signal . But I can get us back to Base . Everdeen , give me the HOLO Everdeen , what 'd I just say ? The HOLO , come on , let 's go . Boggs gave it to me . - What are you talking about ? - He did . He transferred security clearance to her . I saw him . And why would he do that ? I 'm on special orders from Coin . To do what ? To assassinate President Snow . I don 't believe that for one second . As your new unit commander , I order you to transfer security clearance to me . Now . I can 't do that . Let 's not lose our heads here . I 'm not asking it again , Everdeen . Give me that HOLO . She 's telling the truth . Plutarch wants it televised . He thinks if we can film the Mockingjay assassinating Snow , it will make the Capitol surrender before the casualties get too high . While we 're arguing , there 's a hundred peacekeepers on their way here . Boggs promised me that when the time came you would help me . Alright , soldier . The HOLO is yours . I don 't think we 're going to leave any footprints . We should move , now . Most cameras outside should be covered up by the oil . She can 't move forward like this . Her leg 's too bad . We have to evacuate her . I 'm sorry . I 'll stay with her . As soon as we make contact , we will send somebody back . I promise you . Alright , everybody , move out . - Let 's get him up . - Go . Can you walk ? Come on this way . Get these curtains closed . It 's the Leegs . Good afternoon , I 'm Caesar Flickerman . Hear about continuing coverage of the defense of the Capitol . Today , as our peacekeepers valiantly hold off the rebels , our story takes a surprising twist . Katniss Everdeen . Our once favourite daughter , has infiltrated the city with some of the Victors . Who 's names are all too familiar . Finnick Odair and Peeta Mellark . Clearly , some alliances don 't last forever . Take a look at what happened just a moment ago . When our peacekeepers cornered Katniss Everdeen and her band of foolish rebels . Whatever arrogance brought this treacherous girl back to us . You 're about to witness a great victory , not only to the Capitol , but for Panem . So , there you have it . Katniss Everdeen , the girl on fire . A girl who inspired so much violence . Seems to have met a violent end herself . Stay tuned for more information . Caesar Flickerman , thank you . So , now that we 're dead , what are we gonna to do ? Isn 't it obvious ? The next move is to kill me . I murdered one of our squad members . Katniss is right . I 'm a mutt . It 's only a matter of time before I snapped again . I 'm not in control . I need a nightlock pill . So , I can die when I need to . When it gets to that point I 'll kill you myself . I don 't think I ever really understood the Capitol until now . You eat like this you could believe anything . So , Katniss Everdeen . A poor unstable girl with nothing but a small talent with a bow and arrow , is dead . Not a thinker . Not a leader . Simply a face plucked for the masses . Was she valuable ? She was extremely valuable to your rebellion . Because you have no vision , no true leader among you . You call themselves an alliance , but we saw what that means . Your soldiers are at each other 's throats . Good night . Panem For those of you who don 't know me , please allow me to introduce myself . I am President Alma Coin , leader of the rebellion . I 've interrupted a broadcast from your president in which he attempted to defame a brave young woman . A face , picked from the masses , he called her . - Plucked . - As if a leader ... A true leader , could be anything else . I had the privilege of knowing a small town girl from the scene in District 12 , who survived the Hunger Games and the Quarter Quell . And rose up and turned a nation of slaves into an army . Dead or alive . Katniss Everdeen will remain the face of this revolution . She will not have died for nothing . I had no idea I meant so much to her . Her vision and ours will be realised . A free Panem . With self-determination for all . And in her memory , we will all find strength to rid Panem of it 's oppressors . Thank you , and be safe . - Snow is in his mansion . - Where is that ? That 's us . That 's the city circle . It 's at least 70 , 75 blocks north . - 75 blocks ? - Uh huh . Nobody knows we 're alive . This is our chance . These buildings , do these look over Snow 's garden ? - I ... - They do . If he goes outside at all , I can get a clear shot . We are getting ahead of ourselves here . Whether they 're looking for us or not , we 're pinned down . Hit that button , scan for Pods . Just about every 10 steps . Yeah , that doesn 't even show the new ones . So , we can 't go anywhere in the streets . And the red tops suggest as that . There might be another way . My brother knows these tunnels really well . He works sanitation down here . Or after they made him an Avox . Hey . Hey . You 're going to be okay ? Look at me . Look at me . We 're going to get through this , I promise . It take us 5 years to buy his way out of here . He didn 't see the sun once . We 're too expose here . Sir . Shall I call you a doctor ? - What did you say ? - Shall I call for your a doctor ? I hope you waking me for something more urgent than an old man 's health . They survived . I don 't know how . We picked them up on a surveillance cam . Let me see . I-I need to see for myself . It 's her . It is her . Her arena has moved underground . Looks clear . Everybody , okay ? Yeah . Alright , everybody . Let 's stop here for a bit and get some rest , yeah ? I 'll take first watch . Hey , Peeta , you 'll stuck in there . Alright , settle in , everybody . Katniss , your watch . You know , the capital , they used tracker jacker venom on me . That 's what the doctors on 13 said . You were stung once too . Real or not real ? Real . When they used the venom on me , they would show me pictures of my life . But some weren 't real . They changed them . At first , they all-they all blurred together , but now ... now I can sort them out a little . Like the ... little ones that they changed , they have this ... this choir , it 's like they 're They are shiny , they 've been glossed over . You should get some rest . You 're still trying to protect me , real or not real ? Real . That 's what you and I do . Keep each other alive . Katniss . Katniss . What is that ? We got to go . We got to get out of here now . Mutts . They release mutts . Pollux , what 's is the fastest way out ? Come on , go . Go ! - Move ! Move ! Move ! Move ! - Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Pollux , lead us out of here ! Come on . Castor ! Castor ! Fall back ! Move . Katniss. come on ! Move ! Katniss . Go ! Go , go , go ... ! Go , go , go ! Katniss ! - Aww ! - Finnick ! Finnick ! - KATNISS ! - Nightlock . Nightlock . Come on . Come on ! Come on . Come on ! Let 's go ! Keep moving ! Keep moving ! Go ! Go ! Keep going . Keep going ! Peeta , come on . Peeta ! - Peeta , we have to get going ! - I 'm a mutt ! We have to get going . Yes , you can . Leave me . I 'm a mutt ! Look at me ! Look at me . Stay with me . Always . Come on . I know where we are . I know a place . Up those stairs . Keep going . Someone 's coming . Shut the door . Shut the door . No , Katniss , she isn 't in the way . It 's okay . Tigris , you remember me ? I 'm with Plutarch 's Underground . We need your help . Clear ! I know you . You 're a stylist in the Games . Until Snow decided I wasn 't pretty enough anymore . I 'm here to kill him . Gales gonna need stitches . I made it up . All of it . There is no special mission from Coin . It 's only my plan . Everyone that 's dead , is dead because of me . I ... I lied We know . We all knew . - Soldiers from 13 ... - They need to ... Do you really believe that Jackson thought you had orders from Coin ? She trusted Boggs , so he clearly wanted you to go on . I never meant for this to happen . I failed them . I killed-I killed them . I killed Finnick . I 'm sorry , Pollux . I 'm so sorry . Glimmer . Marvel . Mags . Clove . Wiress . Rue . What do all those deaths mean ? They mean that our lives were never ours . There was no real life , because we didn 't have any choice . Our lives , belong to Snow and our deaths do too . But if you kill him , Katniss . If you end all of this ... All those deaths , they mean something . Cinna . Boggs . Castor . Jackson . Finnick . They chose this . They chose you . You should keep this clean , otherwise it will get infected . You should cuff me . It 's not safe with me yet . I have moments when I 'm here ... My memories are getting better , but ... Other times , it 's like I 'm sleepwalking . You should cuff me . Thanks , for the water . I can 't sleep . Yeah , I haven 't slept in days either . I should have volunteered to take your place in the first Games . Well , you couldn 't have . And she-she 'd never have forgiven you . She needs you to be there and take care of her family and you did . She can 't lose you . She really loves you . The way she kissed you in the Quarter Quell . She never kissed me like that . You know it 's part of the show , Gale . No , you won her over . You gave up everything for her . It 's not going to be an issue much longer . I doubt all 3 of us are gonna make it out of this . And if we do , then ... It 's her problem who to choose , right ? Yeah . Well , I do know that Katniss will pick whoever she can 't survive without . Mortar shells . It 's not ours . Peacekeepers must be shelling the rebels outside the city . That 's not outside the city . Sun 's coming up . There 's some small arms fire . Could be Paylor maybe Lyme . The rebels are close . This is it . To all Capitol citizens more than half a mile outside the city circle . I 'm announcing a mandatory evacuation . Come to the mansion . I 'm promising you shelter and sanctuary . All refugees , come to my home There , you will be provided with food , medicine , safety for your children . And you will have my solemn oath to protect you until my dying breath . You should hurry up with that last part . Our enemies are not like us . They do not share our values . They have never known our comfort and our sophistication . And they despise us for it . Make no mistake . They are not coming to liberate us . They are coming to destroy our way of life . They are coming to bury us . Is he still in the mansion ? Peeta ? Yeah . I recognize the room . Where 's that ? About 5 blocks away . We are right here , off the avenues . - The mansion is here - What about the Pods ? Well , they 'd probably deactivate the Pods around here for the resident safety . That could work . I can get close enough . Every peacekeeper is going to be waiting . Next to our faces on every billboard . Snow 's offering shelter to all the refugees . Head straight north . There 's going to be thousands of refugees , just get into that stream and don 't look up . We got one shot . Let 's make it count . Good luck , Katniss . Thank you . Pollux . Tigris , thank you for everything you 've done . Katniss , let me come with you , okay ? - I can be a good distraction , they didn 't know my face - No . No , I 'm not losing you again . You 'll be safer with us . What if peacemakers are searching the houses , and if he 's captured ... Then , give me a nightlock pill , okay . I 'm not going back . Stay alive . If I see you again , it 's going to be a different world . Are you ready , Katniss ? Let 's go . By order of President Snow , all residents must proceed to the presidential estate . Please continue to move forward in a calm and orderly fashion . Additional food , medicine and clothing will be provided upon arrival . By order of President Snow , all residents must proceed to the presidential estate . Please continue to move forward in a calm and orderly fashion . Additional food , medicine and clothing will be provided upon arrival . By order of President Snow , all residents must proceed to the presidential estate . Please continue to move forward in a calm and orderly fashion . Additional food , medicine and clothing will be provided upon arrival . It 's the Rebels ! Don 't move ! Rebels ! Mama ! Mama ! Come on ! Come on . Shoot me ! Shoot me ! Stay calm . Bring your children forward . The gates will open momentarily . The children will be received first . Stay calm . Bring your children forward . The gates will open momentarily . The children will be received first . Stay calm . Bring your children forward . The gates will open momentarily . The children will be received first . It 's the Capitol . Medic ! Medic ! - Medic ! - Make a hole ! Medics coming in . Bring a stretcher ! Prim . Primrose . Prim ! Hey . I need you to lie back . You 're okay . Everything 's going to be okay . The fight was over after that Capitol dropped those bombs at the feet of the palace . The rebels walked right in . Don 't , Katniss . The only one 's working . Everybody felt it . Peacekeepers . Palace Guards . They had kids in there too . It was ... It was over after that . Mom . I remember the first time I brought you here . And here we are . I 've brought all your things . Well , I 'll leave you to get settled . Sorry , ma 'am . I can 't let you pass . Let her in . On my authority . She has a right to anything behind that door . That 's a nice one . The colors are lovely , of course , but nothing says perfection like white . I was hoping you 'd find your way here . There are so many things we should discuss . But I have a feeling your visit will be brief . So , first things first . I wanted to tell you how very sorry I am about your sister . So wasteful , so unnecessary . Anyone could see the game was over by that point . In fact , I was just about to issue an official surrender when they released those parachutes . You released those parachutes . You really think I gave the order ? We both know I 'm not above killing children , but I 'm not wasteful . I take life for specific reasons . And there was no reason for me to destroy a pen full of Capitol children . None at all . I must concede it was a masterful move on Coin 's part . The idea that I was bombing our own helpless children to hold back the Rebels . It turned the last of my guards against me . There was no resistance left inside the Capitol or the mansion . Did you know it aired live ? There 's a ... particular savvy in that , isn 't there ? I 'm sure he wasn 't gunning for your sister , but ... These things happen in war . My failure was being so slow to grasp Coin 's plan . She let the Capitol and the districts destroy one another , and she step in to take power over Thirteen arsenal . But make no mistake . She intends to take my place now . But , I 've been watching you . And you watching me . I 'm afraid we have both been played for fools . I don 't believe you Oh , my dear Miss Everdeen . I thought we had agreed never to lie to each other . President Coin ask for you . You never came to see me . - I wanted to . - Was it ours ? The bomb ? The delayed explosion . The trap . To draw more people in . Was that you ? I don 't know . All I know is , I 'm suppose to take care of your family . And I 'm sorry I couldn 't . You can 't protect anyone in an Arena . Goodbye , Gale . What 's this ? The remaining Victors . Won 't you join us ? I 've invited you all here for several reasons , but first ... I have an announcement . I am taking the burden and the honor of declaring myself interim President of Panem . Interim ? Exactly how long is that interim ? We have no way of knowing for certain . But , it 's clear that people are far too emotional right now to make a rational decision . We 'll plan an election when the time is right . But I 've called you here for a far more important vote . A symbolic vote . This afternoon we will execute Snow . Hundreds of his accomplices also await their deaths . Capitol officials , peacekeepers , torturers , gamemakers . But the danger is , once we begin the rebels will not stop calling for retribution . Thirst for blood is a difficult urge to satisfy . So ... I offer an alternative plan . A majority of four may approve it . No one may abstain . The proposal is this . In lieu of these barbaric executions , we hold a symbolic Hunger Games . You want to have another Hunger Games with the Capitol 's children ? - You 're joking ? - Not in the slightest . Is this Plutarch 's idea ? It was mine . It balances the need for revenge with the least loss of human life . - You may cast your votes . - No . No , obviously not . This is crazy . No , I think it 's more than fair . Snow 's got a granddaughter . I say , yes . So do I. Let them have a taste of it . You guys , this way of thinking is what started these uprisings . I vote no , with Peeta . So would Finnick , if he were here . Well , he 's not , because Snow killed him . No . We need to stop viewing each other as enemies . It 's down to Katniss and Haymitch . I get to kill Snow . I expected no less of you . Then I vote yes ... for Prim . Haymitch . I 'm with the Mockingjay . That carries the vote . Excellent . I 'll announce the games tonight , after the execution . Bound to be quite the show . Oh , you look lovely , as ever . Just beautiful . Finishing touches . Welcome to the new Panem . Today , on the avenue of the tributes . All of Panem , a free Panem will watch more than a mere spectacle . We are gathered to witness a historic moment of justice . Today , the greatest friend of the revolution , will fire the shot to end all wars . May her arrow signify the end of tyranny and the beginning of a new era . Mockingjay , may your aim be as true as your heart is pure . Eh-ha-ha ... Ha ha ha ... No . - Kill him ! - Kill him ! - Kill him ! - Kill him ! Kill him ! I 'll say this for you , Katniss . You don 't disappoint . Well , Plutarch gave me a letter for you . I don 't want it . You never make it easy , do you ? Okay . I 'll read it for you . Katniss , maybe the country was shocked tonight by your arrow , but once again I was not . You 're exactly who I believe you were . I wish I could give you a proper good bye but with both Coin and Snow dead , the fate of the country will be decided tonight and I can 't be seen at your side . Tonight , the 12 district leaders will call for a free election . There 's no doubt that Paylor will carry , she 's become the voice of reason . I 'm sorry so much burden fell on you . I know you 'll never escape it . But if I had to put you through it again for this outcome . I would . The war is over . We 're in that sweet period where everyone agrees not to repeat the recent horrors . Of course , we are fickle stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction . Although who knows ? Maybe this time we 'll learn . I 've secured you a ride out of the capital . It 's better for you to be out of sight . And when the time is right , Commander Paylor will pardon you . The country will find it 's peace . And I hope you can find yours . Plutarch . What now ? Home . We go home . I couldn 't let you go without a proper goodbye . It 's your job to take care of yourself now , Katniss . Promise me you 'll find it . Find what ? The life of a Victor . - Goodbye Effie . - Goodbye , my girl . Effie don 't be a stranger . - Take care of her . - I will . She 's gone . Get out . Get out ! Prim is gone ! Prim is gone ! She 's dead and she 's not coming back ! Get out ! Get out ! Peeta . Hey . You came home . Yeah . I found these ... off by the edge of the forest . It 's Primrose . I 'm so sorry , Katniss . You 'll be happy to hear that Katniss ' mother has been training new medical units in the Capitol . Gale has been promoted to a Captain in District 2 to help keep order and security . And I 'm loving every moment with my son . He reminds me everyday of his father . We 've all suffer so much . But we owe it to their memories and to our children to do our best with these lives . I hope you 're both finding some peace . Annie . I solemnly swear to the best of my ability to preserve , protect and uphold the rights of every citizen at Panem . There 's Plutarch , brand know it all . And they say , no one ever wins the games . You love me . Real or not real ? Real . Did you have a nightmare ? I have nightmares too . Someday , I 'll explain it to you . Why they came . Why they won 't ever go away . But I 'll tell you how I survived it . I 'll make a list in my head , for all the good things I 've seen someone do . Every little thing I can remember . It 's like a game . I do it over and over . Get 's a little tedious after all these years , but ... There are much worse games to play . Subtitle created by : ; = = = € h ☼ ¥ )

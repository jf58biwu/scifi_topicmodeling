 - Mya ! - Holy crap . - Who is she ? What is the history behind this magnificent sculpture recently unearthed on the plains of Arizona in the arid lands of the navajo nation ? How old is she ? She , it , does not conform to any known remnants of navajo history . And the tools needed to construct her suggest a civilization previously unknown . One that may have existed before the dawn of known history . And with your generous commitment , we will hopefully unlock this beautiful enigma and find out what secrets she has hidden . Are there any questions ? The young lady in the corner . Miss Sharon Christine Turner , I believe . - Scout . - Scout . - Any plans for tonight , professor Allen ? - I 'm so glad you asked that . - I 'm glad you 're glad . - Because I have very important plans . - I 'm very intrigued . - As you should be , because they are surprisingly devised very cleverly with you as the focal point . - I am surprised and intrigued . Please elaborate . - They are to wine , dine and just perhaps seduce . - Just perhaps . - My most trusted colleague , miss Sharon Christine Turner . - Scout . - Scout . - I like , I like . - Really ? Which part ? - The dine part . This girl is starving . - Yeah ? So , what do you think ? - Sushi . - No , about our little show and tell . You think it 'll get them excited ? - Make ' em cough green ? - Yeah . - No problem . How could they refuse some one so irrestibly lickable ? - I am truly irresistible . - But you 've got to change that part about hopefully discovering the truth . - How so ? - To we will discover the truth . Be positive , young man . - Ah , no can do , my gal . You know us serious academic types . - Like you ? - Like me . Can 't make those kinds of promises . - Then what kind can you promise me , professor Daniel Allen ? - Oh , serious time now ? - Maybe . - Ah , okay . - I , Daniel Allen , promise to scout that I will forever ... Be saved by the bell . - Only reprieved . - Hey , Bryan . - Danny . - You calling me from your big deal secret location ? - That I am , my man . - And is this the call , the holy shit one you promised me ? - Ah , no , amigo , no . This is the call saying that holy shit 's not happening tonight . - You know , I 'm starting to think that just maybe you don 't have that world changing discovery that 's going to finally put you on top . - No , no , it 's for real . Okay , no stop to the top . Don 't you doubt that . - Oh , I won 't . - Cool . - For now . - Trust me , it 's way bigger than your mystery woman statue . - So you say - so I say . But , um , there 's been a delay , all right ? It 's outta my hands . Sorry . Okay ? - Yeah , but I 'm still starting to doubt you . - It 'll be worth the wait , pal . I promise you . - Oh , boy , oh , boy . - Yeah , ah , you might want to be watching CNN tonight . - Really ? - Really . - Okay . Might . Take care , Bryan . Carter . Calling from who-knows-where . - Ooh , about who-knows-what ? - Yep . - Still trying to outshine you ? - Yeah , maybe . But now , we can directly proceed to the wine , dine , and seduce . - Oh , boy , oh , boy . - It 's the greatest discovery since , ah , man went to the moon . Shit , shit , that sucks . Asshole . Okay , all right , something better , something better . Don 't be a fool , be cool . Hi . - And a big hi right back at you , Mr. Carter . - Uh , sorry , I was expecting someone else . - I know . The alphabet boys . Abc , nbc , CNN . - Oh , yeah , kinda . - Oh , please don 't be embarrassed . I completely understand . But before you get your 15 minutes , I would , we , were sent to make sure that your incredible , uh ... - discovery . - Discovery , thank you , is what you say it is . No offense , I hope . - No , no , not at all , none taken , none taken . I 'd probably do the same if somebody told me they had a , but it 's for real . - Oh , I certainly hope so . - No doubt whatsoever . As crazy and as whacked out as it sounds , I mean , this is the genuine article , Mr. ? - Kontral . But Richard , please . And this is Nicole , my facilitator . - Hi . - Hi . - All right , Richard , right this way . Right this way to the greatest discovery since microwave popcorn . Shit . - That is wonderful . - Alphabet time now , Richard ? So we had to , we had to cut away about 2,000 tons of ore , when they , I , I found it . See , I at first thought it was just a new strata , but when I got closer and saw what those taco boys were digging up , I made them clear out fast . - Good for you , Bryan . - Yeah , yeah , there 's no way I want them chattering away about this . - Nor would I. - Look at it . Doesn 't it look brand new ? Like it could have been made yesterday . - It does indeed . - There 's not a scratch on it . It 's gotta be over 14,000 years old . - Really ? 14,000 . How on earth would you know that ? - Well , age of the ore around it . That 's when the geog , um , geologists think it collapsed on it . And look , these hieroglyphics . That 's not any language I 've ever seen . - That is incredible . - You think that 's incredible ? Wait ' til you hear the most incredible part . You know what I think we got here ? - The suspense is killing me , Bryan . - This isn 't some old Indian piece of junk . No . What we 've got here is an alien spaceship . An ancient alien spaceship . I 'm talking chariots of the fucking gods here , Richard ! And you know something , I think it 's still working . Feel it . Feel the power inside ? The sucker 's alive . - Perhaps . - It is , it is and not just from this whatever . The whole area is vibrating . - Really ? You know , I believe you 're correct . - Damn right . - Damn right you are . Nicole . - If it is , if it is , do you know what this means ? Do you have any idea what this means ? - I know what this means . - What a goofball . - Don 't you ever make light of taking a human life again , Nicole . You know how I feel about that . What you 've just done is horrible . But necessary . Your next priority is make sure no one else understands the true nature of this ... Just a moment , just a moment . Patience , Patience . I 'll soon unlock your secrets . - And with your generous commitment we will unlock this beautiful enigma . - Perfect . They 're going to be coughing green now that you went with my brilliant suggestions . - Well , a guy will agree to just about anything after a great ... - dinner ? - Dinner . - How 's that for a dramatic opening image , huh ? It is kind of cool , isn 't it ? - Maybe , if we knew what it was . - And who you are . - A legitimate request , miss Turner . I 'm Richard kontral . - And Richard kontral is ? - Just a well-paid messenger boy for some very liquid guys . - And they are ? - Oh , of no matter right now . What does matter is that they might just have had the good fortune to come across a most incredible discovery ? - And that 's it ? - Oh , this is a very small part of it . Part of something that 's very , very old . - And by very , very old you mean ? - Over 14,000 years old . - 14,000 years , that 's ... - pre-history . Well , known history at any rate . Well , let 's just say well before that overrated sphinx would become a gleam in the eyes of its primitive creator . - What do you want from profess , us ? - To help me figure out what the hell this thing is and what message its trying to send us from ... - over the river of time ? - Nicely put . And how , miss Turner , would you like to join us on a wondrous journey along that mysterious river ? - It 's beautiful . - I had no idea that its surface , was so ... - perfect . - Crafted , sculpted , with tools ... - unknown . - Exactly . That 's , that 's why I wanted you to actually see it . To understand . Not just view it digitally . - Good thinking . - That 's what I do . That 's the way I am . - And you two will help me translate what these writings actually mean , if indeed writings is what they are . - In all likelihood . - That 's what we do . - We 're going to need textural laser scans of the surface . - Of course . I 've already ordered them . - That 's what you do . - Great . - Daniel , look at this . The top part of this , whatever , it 's the same as ... - this . - Yes , indeed . I hadn 't noticed that . Well done , miss Turner . - So that would mean that buried below this is ... - a vehicle from the stars . Chariot of the gods . - Holy crap . - My sentiments exactly . - Okay , let 's not get ahead of ourselves here . That 's a pretty big leap . - Perhaps , but I think not . - Why wouldn 't you try to uncover it ? - Yeah , dig it up ? - Oh , I will , miss Turner . I most certainly will . But discretion above all . It 's waited 14,000 years , it can wait a little while longer , at least as long as it takes to tell its story . And that , of course , is your assignment . - That 's ... - what we do . - Not exactly . What we do is translate the writings of ancient cultures , human cultures . But something from another world . - Not much different . - We 'll try our ... - make it happen . - I know you will . - Yeah , sure . - What wonders will you reveal ? Why are you also here , mystery woman ? - Scout , you okay ? - Yeah . - You sure ? - Totally . - Okay . - Not from the stars . From our forgotten past . - Hey , hon , what ' cha doing ? Scout ? - Daniel , I know the key . - Hm ? - To understanding , translating these ... - alien writings ? - They 're not . - They 're not what ? - Alien . It 's not a chariot of the gods that kontral 's found . - Not an alien spacecraft ? - No , they were created by humans . - From earth ? - Yes . And they left us a message . - Well , let 's see if we can translate it then . - That 's what we do . Not from the stars , from our forgotten past . - You ready ? The driver should be here . It 's almost time . - To kiss off all we 've done ? - Now what is that supposed to mean ? - Nothing . Never mind . - Come on , don 't be that way now , okay ? - I am what I am . - The woman I love . The woman who figured out the translations . And the woman who 's now acting fucking weird . - You should have stopped at number two . - But I am what I am . - Hey , guys , your ride 's here . - Thanks , Eli . Your timing was perfect . - A really decadent stretch limo . - Does it have crystal glassware ? Eyes wide shut . - Keep your clothes on . - I 'll try . - Not an alien ship from some other world as we suspected , but rather a vessel constructed by an ancient , very human , and long forgotten civilization . Now , even though the details of this startling conclusion has been transmitted to you , I thought it beneficial for you to meet the people responsible for so brilliantly translating these ancient writings . Dr. Daniel Allen and miss Sharon Turner . - Thank you , Mr. kontral . - Oh , please , Richard . - Good afternoon , everyone . - Good afternoon . - Contrary to Richard 's very kind words about our work , the etchings proved , because of miss Turner 's intuition , to be extremely simple to decipher . - Ray Charles could have done it . - Well , not quite that simple but with today 's high speed computers , translations of unknown codes and languages are much easier . There 's no need for a rosetta stone . - You both are quite humble . - He is , I 'm not . - True . But they were created , intentionally designed , so that any reasonably intelligent culture could read them . - And learn . - Which is the translation in your report ? - Yes , but that 's only the surface meaning . - I don 't understand . - Well , we 've determined that there are hints to the real attitude and dialect of the , the story teller beyond that of the literal translation . And miss Turner ... - scout . - Thank ya . - Has created , composed a draft in which I believe is the true character of the ancient historian . She has revealed the emotional content . - Really ? You can do that ? - I can . That 's what I do . - Then please do so , scout . - This world has been ours for countless millennia , ruled under the benevolent bloodline of , a name I can 't translate , but now approached destruction . He refused to allow the cosmos to erase all that he has so wonderfully created . He is our lord god , my lover , and through his mighty strength wished to forge a new world , a continuing destiny for his people . He tasked me to complete his vision and I have failed , unable to return to where he waited . For those who may rise again along this river of time , I have inscribed his name for eternity to remember , our lord god . - A love letter . - In a way , I suppose . - It is . From across the river of time . - Surprisingly romantic . - And enigmatic . - Yes , very . What else do you know about this ancient culture ? - Zip . But with your ... - that 's all . - And the craft buried below the etchings ? - Nothing . Richard wouldn 't allow us . - You have all the information . And we believe it is a fantastic mystery . - One that I , we , want to , can solve . - I understand your desire but ... - but ? - But your assignment has now been fulfilled brilliantly and completely . You have our thanks and the considerable fee that will soon be deposited in your accounts . - Now it 's time for others to continue . - I totally disagree . We 're the ones who did all this research and we can continue this project . - Again , thank you . - Hey , come on . - Easy there . - Mr. kontral ? - Yes ? - It would now be appropriate for you to ... - Jesus , scout . - Still here , Eli . Talk later . With everything we 've learned , it makes perfect sense for us to continue , to see this project through . - Your service is greatly appreciated , miss Turner . But it is now over . - You do understand that . - Yes , we understand our agreement but we are ... - but we 're the most qualified . - We will be in communication again with you . - Very soon . - I think we should talk now . - Goodbye . - Oh , come on . This is ridic ... - goodbye . For now . Come on . - Yeah , okay . See ya around . - Celebration time ? - Yeah , sure . - I need a drink but not to celebrate . - Huh ? That doesn 't sound so great . What happened ? - Nothing . It went mostly fine . - Fine ? - Can we not do this now ? - We turned in our report , were patted on our heads , and told to hit the road . - Ouch . - That 's not exactly what happened . - Oh , really ? Then tell me what did . - We wrapped up our job . - Our job ? - The one we agreed to do and get paid for . Our job . - So , discovering , interpreting , what could potentially change the world , change the world , that 's just a job ? - Change the world ? I know the world should be changed . - It needs to be changed . - But saying this discovery could is extreme . - No , it isn 't , Daniel . If what we 've found out was made public , then everyone 's beliefs in reality , in history , would transform . - Maybe . - No maybe . You know I 'm right about this . - Fine , you 're right . - Thank you , professor . - But are you sure you 're not pissed just because we might not be getting credit ? - Yeah , that 's me , all right . My goal 's always been to be interviewed by fake news . - I 'm sorry . I know that 's not you . - Apology accepted . - Okay , I 'm listening . Tell us what you want us to do . - Daniel , I just want us to somehow follow this through . I just want to find out who really wrote those inscriptions . Why did she risk so ... - if it was a she . - It was . Why did she risk so much for her lord god and her world of 14,000 years ago ? - A world that was much more advanced than now . - Yeah , that 's also kind of major , isn 't it ? - Yes . - And what happened to them ? Why , how , did their civilization vanish ? - That 's a good question . - And why aren 't we being allowed to search for the answers ? - I don 't know . - And no clue as to what kontral 's bosses are planning on doing next . - True . - I mean , who are those guys anyway ? They certainly didn 't make me feel especially warm and fuzzy . - Same . - So ? - Fuck ' em , we go public . - Yes . - Right , we tell the world . We give fake that interview . - That is why you are still the man and I love , you know . - I do . - Yeah . - Ready for that drink ? - Yes , to celebrate . - Agreed . - All right . - Oh , crap . What 's wrong with the ? Can you help me ? - Okay . - No , scout . - Oh , sure . - You know you drive me nuts . - That 's my job . - Crazy kids . Ha ! Hey , it 's interview time . - Hello , handsome . My god , what happened ? Dr. Allen , miss Turner . Are you all right ? Are you okay ? Guess we 'll do this the fun way . - Ready to proceed ? - Definitely , showtime . - Resolution ? - It 's not gonna moisten halo 's pants , but it 's kickin . ' - I 'll take that as a good . - 548 ultra , ultra sensitive suckers kissing it . Feeding into this hungry maxi gig baby . Yeah , it 's killer good . - Just get on with the tour , please . - Going in . Now , the images are pretty accurate but what we 're seeing is anybody 's guess . Oh , oh , something bad coming up . Bonus points . - Zoom in and enhance . - Aye , captain . We 're going in . - Whoa ! Holy crap . - Get , get more detail . - Uh , we 're at Max . - Another piece to the puzzle . - A rubik 's cube . - An appropriate analogy . - Oh , Mr. kontral . - What is it ? - I 'd like to show you something , sir . - Zero effect . Like a diamond . Denser . Infinitely . - Now that 's interesting . - It would take something nuclear tipped to break this baby apart . - Well , that 's never out of the question . - You can do that ? - You have no idea what I can do . - Shit . - But then we 'd lose our little discovery wouldn 't we if I went all strangelove on it ? And I do so much though want to know what secrets you contain . - Kontral , you are one supreme prick . - That 's an understatement , scout . And he 's sitting on ... - the discovery of the century . - Another understatement . - Then I suggest , sir , that you decide what you want to do a-sap . - You do ? And why is that ? - Our sensors are indicating increased , growing activity inside . Circuits , engines , something is starting up . - It 's reactivating ? - Yes . - That 's interesting . - And I think it 's getting ready to take off . - Now , after waiting 14,000 years ? - My guess is that it was covered under tons of ore that buried it . And when we scraped it off , something inside said it could now break free . - Well , can it ? - I have no idea of knowing its power but I 'm pretty damn sure that 's what it 's preparing to do . - Well , we 're just going to have to change its plans , aren 't we ? - You 're the boss . - Yes I am . - Doctor Allen , I presume . - Crap - stay down . It 's time for the world to know , kontral . - Now why on earth would you come to that conclusion ? Nicole . Lock on and execute . - Oh no ! - I 'm sorry . I couldn 't finish our job . - Oh , no ! - Hey , hey . It 's okay . It 's just a dream . - Death and destruction . - That 's a worry . - Everything was burning and I couldn 't stop it . - It 's okay . It was just a dream . Remember ? - Yeah , sorry , sorry . - Don 't be sorry . - It was really scary . - Yeah , I figured that . - You 're so smart . - And lovable . - Just barely . Can you hold me ? - If I must . - Mm , feel good ? - It does . - Mission accomplished . - Remember , we are god 's creation . And the creator of all has placed his divine instructions in the scriptures telling us , no instructing us , that it is our right , our destiny , to enrich ourselves from the world 's limitless ever = plentiful resources . We must ... - this is where you should be . Good food and good people . - Thank you . - You 're quite welcome . Now promise me you 'll find your way home . Okay ? God bless you . - You too . - Sharon Turner , 22 , is being sought for the brutal murder of Daniel Allen . Allen 's charred and dismembered body was discovered late last night by firefighters in his oak palm apartment . Allen and Turner were reported to have been romantically involved and that Allen had repeatedly tried to end their affair . - You can 't occupy a booth without ordering something . - Coffee . I didn 't order that . - No coffee for you . No coffee period . Fucking spill by the fucking upstream chem plant contaminated the town 's water . My idiot boss should close the place . - Bad news . - Yeah . Anyway , you need this more than coffee . It 's no charge . You look like crap . - Thanks , for the sundae . - No big deal . Nobody orders dessert anymore . It 's like a world gone mad . - Yeah . - Do uou need a job ? - No , I 'm okay . - Yeah , right . Look , if they ever clean up this water mess , they 're gonna need help here . Its ' not too shitty once the owner gets the message you 're not going to blow him . - No , really . - Okay . Snot . - Yeah . - Tears . - Can 't stop ' em . - Bad news ? - Bad , bad day . - Mary , when we gonna get some coffee ? - Ask the president . How bad ? - Real bad . Lost ... - your guy ? - Yeah . No , he wasn 't just a guy . He was the only one who saw the real me . He was my best friend before he was ... - look , life goes on , hon . You 'll find another . - He was killed today . - Fuck . - Murdered . - Double fuck . - And they 're going to get away with it . - What are you saying ? - They 're too rich , they 're too powerful . - I don 't know what happened . I don 't want to know . But you got to make them pay somehow . - But I can 't . - Somehow . You can 't let the bad guys always win . - And you must fulfill your destiny . - Always ringing at the wrong time . And I hate that it 's always broadcasting your location . Stay brave . - Good evening . Good evening again , one and all . - You know why we requested your presence , don 't you , Richard ? - Oh , I can guess . - Don 't guess . Tell us . - Please . - To explain why the ancient craft has yet to be disposed of . - Destroyed . The harlot captured . And eliminated . - You know that I will ultimately follow your orders . - Ultimately ? - Oh , I , ah , ah , please do not misinterpret . - Are we ? - I pray not but I would , once again , wish to request more time to access its inner workings . - We grow weary of explaining to you that whatever it contains can not counter the negative cultural effects of its existence . - Even , even if it were not constructed by creatures , monsters , from some other world but built instead by humans identical to us from some long past age ? - Even more so . - Certainly , you have not forgotten that such knowledge of their existence would undermine our prime means of control . - Of course not . - The time for closure has now arrived . - Has passed . - And I will immediately fulfill your wishes . The relic ground into dust and scattered to the wind . - The harlot ? - Located and butchered , of course . - See that you do . - I will . - Good evening , Richard . - Fuck . - What 's up ? Oh yes , sir , Mr. kontral . - I 'm accelerating the examination of our project . - Cool . - Be prepared to begin with ... - this the harlot you 're looking for , shithead ? - So melodramatic . How on earth did you manage to get in here ? - Amazing what some guys 'll do for major blow job . - From you ? I don 't think so . - I care not . - You do realize you 're not getting out of here alive , dear . - Kind of figured that . - So why the visit ? - To slit your fucking throat . - Oh , such malice . - Yes , that 's me . - Ugh , how blandly lower middle class . Just because we butchered your pathetic little sweetheart ? - Fuck . - On your knees . - Listen to her . - It 's the only way you 're ever gonna get a woman to do that , you creep . - Why must you continuously insist on referencing such an unpleasant subject , Sharon ? - Fuck you . - I do like your attitude . So come on , tell me . Just to satisfy my ever inquiring mind , how did you manage to slip by security ? - No sweat . Your girlfriend stepped out for a smoke . - Nicole , I 'm disappointed . - Your bosses need a higher level of employment . - Oh well , it 's a national problem . I am sorry we didn 't get to spend more quality time together , Sharon . Oh , well . Dispose of her . Oh , that you 'll find she 's really very good at . - Holy shit . - Oh , oh , that 's awkward . You , uh , heard our whole little confrontation ? - Uh , I know nothing . - Help me . Don 't let this ... - now my hand is seriously pained . It 's about time we put an end your sad little story . - Uh , Mr. kontral ? - What ? - When that woman comes on camera , the readings here , they blast off the charts . - What do you mean ? - From the spaceship . - Really ? - Yep . - What , when it saw her ? Point your camera at her . Huh , change of plan . Bring her along with us . Oh , secure her in the usual manner . Welcome , Sharon . Now let 's see if you really are essential to this historic puzzle . - Fuck you . - Check the readouts . Shazam . - All right , here , let me have that . Aha . Well , now that is very interesting . You really are linked to our little project , aren 't you ? - All I did was interpret some etchings . Just doing my job , you creep . - No , you 're far more than that , way beyond random coincidence . This ship lying dormant for thousands of years and then reacting now only to you . Serendipity ? Oh , I don 't think so . Chess pieces are being moved . - Go fuck yourself . - Now , Sharon , if you 're going to be part of history , you 'll have to be a little more elegant . Ho , ho , ho , it just can 't wait to meet you . - Easy with the camera . - Bill me . Come on , let 's take a little walk . - Um , I 'll stay here and man the shop . - Stay close . And those idiots wanted me to destroy this treasure . Bring her . Well , you were right about one thing . It is beautiful . - It 's not yours . - Oh , whose is it ? - It belongs to ... - to the world ? To science ? - Yes . - Well , that 's not going to happen . Give me your gun . So you and I are going to continue our little walk alone . Just to see what happens . Move . Come on , don 't be frightened . I have a very strong feeling this thing doesn 't want to harm you . - Yeah , well hopefully that doesn 't include you . - Wait . A valid concern . On your knees . - What ? - On your knees . - You 're fucking kidding me . - I never kid . Just do it . Put your hands on the surface . Touch it . Ho , ho , ho , ho . It is so exited to see you . Now , what do you feel ? I said , what do you feel ? - It 's cold , powerful . - Wonderful . Cold power . Wonderful . Thank you , Sharon , I don 't think I could have put it any better myself . See , that 's what this has all been about . Cold power , Sharon . Cold power and when I have it at my command , when I control it , I mean fully control it , and in my control alone , then I 'll take that power and the world will have to listen to Richard kontral . - Asshole . - Oh , shit . Time for a smoke . Nice tin man . Nice tin man . Have fun tonight , bitch . - Hello ? Hello ? Anybody out there ? How 's it going ? Hello ? - Hey , hey , hey . You don 't want to miss the whole adventure , do you ? Your awakening has been duly noted by our tall friend . - Oh , god . - And he appears to be very interested ... - shut the fuck up . - Take your clothes off . - What , and get on my knees ? - Oh , please , you 're not that irresistible . Take them off . Do it , or it 's going to . - Okay , okay , okay . - Pst ! - What ? - Socks , don 't forget your socks . - Stop helping me . - Wow , queen of outer space . - You have no idea of how close you are . - Well then , would you please enlighten me . - Since when did we become friends ? Slitting your throat is still my number one priority . - Well , that 's a real shame . And here I thought we were getting along so well . - Forward . Huh , even Mr. ray Charles , right ? - What ? - Nothing of interest . - The moon ? We 're there ? - Apparently so . - So fast . How is that possible ? - Super science . Super power . - So , you haven 't a clue . - Not a one . You 're the first woman on the moon , I believe . Any appropriate words ? - Fuck off . - Oh . - And you 're wrong . - How so ? - I 've met her twin sister . - Who is she ? - Curiouser and curiouser grows our tale . Well , that was entertaining . - Since when did you become comedy relief ? - Oh , please , by no means . - Just shut the hell up . Don 't say another word to me . Got it ? - Got it . - Oh , you got to be kidding me . Sure , after flying to the moon and getting attacked by a killer robot , how difficult can it be putting on an ancient space suit ? Why not ? - Okay . Ready for whatever . - I have to say I 'm very curious to see what awaits you . - Stop , stop , stop ! - Thank you . Thank you . Thank you so much . Thank you . Thank you . But why , why did you do that ? - Not sure . Maybe I 'm just a good person . - Thank you . I really thought I was ... - or maybe I wanted to kill you myself . - Whatever . Just be careful . We 're in this together now , you know . Come back in one piece , okay ? No , fuck you . - Journey 's end . - Watching , learning while you were dreaming , my sweet little scout . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , easy , easy . Up , up , up , and away we go . Homeward bound , nice and steady , nice and steady . Second star on the right and straight on to morning . - Damn you . - Now what ? - Asshole . I 'll try . I 'll try . Dear god , what have I done ? I 'm going to follow it through , Daniel . Finish our job . Garen . Waiting for Mya - long ago , the krell crystal created a world for our people . The crystal 's origin was unknown , lost in time . When destruction from the stars was foretold , lord god garen bid me to bring the krell to this world , so he could prepare a new home for our people . But I failed , so I have selected you to fulfill my destiny . - Will you one day be awakened and thanked for making this new world , my lord god garen ? - On your knees , Sharon . - Hey . Hey . Here . Right here . Come on . Come on . Hey , I 'll get on my knees . Queen of outer space ? No way . Into the river of time .

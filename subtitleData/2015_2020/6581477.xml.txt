 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... You 're pursuing Andrew . And I 've retasked a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. servers to look for him . I can help . Joey : What is that ? Hydra . Malick : I made some moves this week to ensure we have all the Inhumans we need when the time comes . - Why go to all this trouble ? - I 'm building an army . Malick is supposed to be the last head of Hydra , but I can 't shake this feeling that he 's reporting to someone else . May : Someone more powerful than Malick ? Someone or something . [ music ] 3x15 - " Spacetime " [ music ] [ Blows ] [ Siren wailing in distance ] Starting fires now , huh ? No , no . Don 't ... Don 't want trouble . Just needed , um ... art supplies . - It 's Charlie , right ? - Well , Charles . Look , I can 't have you sleeping back here anymore . It 's not good for business . - I 'm about to open . - Okay . Uh , but , um , I could help out if you want ... sweep up or , you know , any ... anything else you need . I just need you to clear out . The sun will up in a few minutes . There 's a shelter over on 9th . [ Sighs ] Look grab yourself some breakfast on the way . No , no , no , no . No , I-I don 't want any trouble . You seem like a nice guy . I-I just need to keep the customers I got . Now , take it . [ Groaning ] [ Strained ] Daisy , help . Save me , please . - So sorry ... - We 're running out of time , Daisy . This is where I die . [ Indistinct conversations ] Dispatcher : I 'm sorry , sir . Please calm down . I 'm having a hard time understanding you . Man : There 's someone coming here to kill me ... Hydra . Sir , we 're sending two cars to your location . Man : No , there 's no time for that . I need Daisy Johnson . Who ? S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors emergency dispatch ? All the time , all over the world ... it 's how we 're first on the scene . Who was the caller ? Man identified himself as Edwin Abbott . Owns a local grocery store in Dyker Heights . No affiliation with S.H.I.E.L.D. or any intelligence agency , for that matter . - Just a guy . - May : You don 't know him ? Never seen him , never heard of him . Prepare the Quinjet for disconnect . - Yes , sir . - He knew your name . And mentioned Hydra . Can 't be good . - May even be a trap . - We 'll need ground tactical at the ready . You 're coming ? Good . With Mack on bed rest , we could use the extra muscle . Well , he 's the only one with extra muscles , but I 'll come anyway . We don 't know what we 're walking into . [ Engine rumbles ] [ Police radio chatter ] Edwin : I already told you ... I 'm not crazy . [ Vehicle door closes ] This is happening . [ Breathing heavily ] - There ... There she is . - And who are you , now ? Daisy Johnson , ATCU . Um , Edwin , right ? How did you know my name , Edwin , when you called 911 ? Because I heard you say it just now . Uh ... what are you saying ? - I-I saw this . - You saw what ? This moment ... talking to you , - the ... the cops ... all of it . - I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I 'm not following . Charles , the crazy homeless guy who lives in the alley ... he ... he ... he put ... must have put a curse on me or something . He made me see ... this . I-I saw this . - I 'm gonna go check it out . - You got to get me - out of here before they come and kill me . - Oh , okay , okay . We will protect you . But how did you know that it was Hydra who 's coming ? Because that 's what she 'll yell when they come out of the sky . [ music ] [ Jet engine whirring ] Hydra ! [ Gunshot ] [ Gunfire ] Go ! [ Gunfire ] Help ... Save me , please ! Don 't worry . I 'll get you out of this . - Just lay low for a second . - We 're running out of time . Daisy ... - this is where I die . - No ... No ! [ Breathing heavily ] [ Gunfire continues ] The man 's Inhuman . The homeless man 's Inhuman . They 're after him ! No ! No ! Aah ! [ music ] [ Both grunting ] I was hoping you could help . [ Grunts , panting ] Hey ... . - Hey , hey . You all right ? - Hey , Daisy , talk to me , please . - We need medical ! - I know . I 'm sorry . We lost one . - No . No , no , no . - What 's wrong ? What is it ? [ Panting ] [ music ] It hasn 't happened yet . [ music ] [ Wine pours ] [ music ] He is risen ! What an improvement . Last time I saw you , you looked like an extra from [ Chuckling ] " Dawn of the Dead . " And now ... now you 're a man who can inspire . To what do we owe this miraculous turnaround ? To your patience . [ Soft piano music playing ] A thank-you is overdue ... for bringing me back . Well , I didn 't exactly move Heaven and Earth , uh , but I did move a lot of earth ... money , manpower ... - anything to make it happen . - I 'd like to know why . [ Glass thumps lightly ] Why ? - Meaning , to what end ? - Why ? I , uh ... My family , my ancestors were taught to believe that if we managed to return you from that godforsaken place that we would be rewarded . With what ? Together , we are supposed to take over the world . And what does that look like to you ? [ music ] You have $ 9.2 billion . The influence that comes with ... any object of your desire can be yours . That 's not enough ? What can I give you ... - that you couldn 't have before ? - Look , I 've dedicated my life , - surrendered my life to a higher power . - That 's the word power . And that 's what you seek ... not wealth or control or clout ... no , true power . How does that sound ? Intriguing . It 's time to go above ground ... and finally show you what true power really feels like . [ music ] Simmons : You 're sure it was the future ? - My whole face was covered in ... - Uh-huh . And Coulson shoots you ? Yep . Coulson : Then I 'll just ask the question that someone should ask at some point ... - is this even possible ? - Technically , - it 's-fourth-dimensional perspective . - Well , Hermann Minkowski would say yes , for one . - That guy Edwin predicted everything that happened . - Lincoln : We had a similar experience with Raina , remember ? That 's a dumb question . Okay , got it . So , we all agree it 's possible . Now what ? - I can change it . - No . We can reverse-engineer the visions , figure out where this went down , and get there ahead of it . - Save that poor man . - You can 't . I mean , fourth-dimensionally speaking , is all . If you saw the future , then that 's the future . I don 't want to believe that . I can 't explain how it felt , but it was awful . [ music ] I felt so helpless . I was inches away from him . I have to save him . Lincoln : Edwin called in with your name for a reason . Maybe you 're meant to change it . And we know what this homeless man , Charles , looks like . And we 're running a search . If Daisy can remember details about the location - and we get there in time , we ... - Guys , there is no time . Fitz : She glimpsed the fourth dimension . Time is an illusion . It 's how we perceive the fourth dimension . - Simmons . - It 's mathematics . - He 's talking about space-time . - How do you ... How can I explain this ? Right . We 're 3-D , yeah ? Okay , but imagine ... imagine we lived in a 2-dimensional existence ... flat , just like a piece of paper . We wouldn 't be able to conceive of three dimensions , of ... of ... of a ... a cube or anything that 's - not 2-dimensional , okay ? - Yeah . Right , so , we flat paper people would perceive this 3-dimensional cube as many separate 2-dimensional moments . As time passing ... the point on the line traveling through space and time . - But , in fact , the cube , the line is fixed . - Yeah , it 's just sitting there . There 's no future . There 's no past . It just ... It just is . And nothing you can do will change that . [ Marker thumps ] You 're hurting my brain . Coulson : Look , I don 't know if Fitz is right or if I even understand what he 's saying , really , but Hydra has this guy . And we got to try to stop them . - I think I might have a strategy . - We 're all ears . All we have to do to guarantee that we change the outcome is not let Daisy out of the base . What ? No . I have to go help him . The one thing we know for certain is that Daisy was at the center of these visions , whereas May doesn 't appear in any of them . Look , I get the logic , but I can handle this myself . I 'm sorry . May goes instead . Coulson ... I was meant to save him . If you want to try to stop this man from dying , then this is how we 're doing it . Understood ? [ music ] Lincoln and I will chase down any intel we can on the homeless man . Daisy , remember every detail you can about where this happens , and then we 'll send May . No one else goes . I won 't pick up a gun until this is finished . And Fitz-Simmons will stay out of the damn snow . [ music ] Are we clear ? [ Computer beeping ] Got to admit ... this time stuff 's always been a little over my head . Like in " Terminator , " if John Connor 's alive and able to send his friend back in time to save his mom to make sure he 's born , doesn 't that mean he doesn 't have to ? I , uh , I never saw the original " Terminator . " You 're off the team . [ Chuckles ] What 's ... What 's tripping me out is that we only knew to try to save the guy because he heard Daisy 's name when we went to try to save the guy . I know , right ? But that 's what makes me think it happened for a reason . - It 's design . - Sure . We 're all part of some grand plan . Only problem is , we never know what the plan is . No , I-I mean , Inhumans were designed . And our powers were designed not to be random , but to fill a need , a ... a gap that 's missing . - So Raina ... - Everything she said came true . Yes , but because of that , Daisy was able to stop Jiaying . Daisy will be able to help this guy Charles , whoever he is . Change the outcome ? I hope so . Your face was covered in blood . [ Computer beeping ] That 's him . Charles Hinton . Last known address ... Sadly , it looks like Charles did not live alone . - Send a team . - Yes , sir . I wouldn 't worry about me , sir . You should worry about yourself . Because Daisy saw me shoot her ? [ music ] Because I 'd kill you if you did . I was hoping you could help . [ music ] There ... There 's a red metal staircase nearby . It 's a rooftop , 20 stories , at least . And the light was weird ... maybe a ... a ... a flashing billboard behind me ? I wish I could remember more clearly . They 're probably taking him there now . And whatever bad thing happens , I feel like it happens tonight . [ Door opens ] - What are you doing ? - I 'm trying to find the building . I 've retasked the S.H.I.E.L.D. servers to search for keywords we 're feeding in . - Not all the servers . - Yeah , all of them . - [ Sighs ] Daisy ... - May , if I 'm not allowed to go on the mission myself , then I 'm sure as hell gonna do everything I can from here . [ clank ] Not all of them ! [ Breathing heavily ] Got it ? She and I have built a similar algorithm to find Dr. Garner , and a number of the servers are running it . We 're both understandably desperate to find him . No worries . I 'll leave those servers alone . Do you think we can do it ... change the future ? Every move we make changes the future . The real feat would be changing the past . [ music ] - It 's you . - Oh . You touched him , didn 't you ? [ music ] Coulson : Charles Hinton 's wife . He was a teacher ... well-liked , but he walked out on her and their 18-month-old daughter in July . Walked out ? Why ? - It drove him crazy . - When did it start ? It was a Sunday . We 'd just gotten home from the farmer 's market , and it started to pour . Charles ran out to the yard to bring our daughter 's toys inside . And I hear him howl like he hurt himself . I ran out and found him on the ground covered with some kind of ... crust . I took his hand ... and we saw flashes ... random events , ending with a horrific car crash . - He sees it , too ? - We just sat there , shocked . But then , leading him inside , it happened again . We saw ... We saw my mother in a hospital bed . Code blue . So you had to stop physical contact ? We thought we were going crazy . But it would happen any time Charles touched anyone . He and that person would both see someone 's death . Daisy : A death ? That was probably enough to make Charles go mad , but then it got so much worse - a few days later when ... - The visions started coming true . [ music ] Did he ever try to stop them from happening ? Of course ! [ Voice breaking ] Of course he tried ... over and over . That 's what sent him over the edge , I guess . He couldn 't make a difference ... not one . He was powerless . [ music ] Daisy : Is there any other detail you could share with us that could help ? - Could you tell us about the bird ? - Bird ? Charles carved a little bird ... I think it was a ... robin ... - out of wood . - He did ? [ music ] That 's our daughter 's name ... Robin . Charles left in the night , and he didn 't take anything but a jacket . He left because he would never be able to hold his little girl again . [ music ] At least , not without her crying and screaming and seeing death . What 's so pressing that couldn 't wait a few days , Gideon ? [ Chuckles ] Well , you know me . I seize opportunity . This state-of-the-art prosthetic contains some hardware manufactured by you here at Transia ... the nerve-wire interface , to be precise . Okay . And I 'm aware your company 's been working on an exoskeletal limb-assist prototype for the Defense Department using this same technology . So ... I 'd like to buy it . Buy one of our leading patents . [ Chuckles ] No , no . The company . [ Chuckles ] Can you repeat yourself ? I must be losing it , but I thought I just heard you ... I 'd like you to sign your company over to me ... for a fair price , of course . Yeah . Uh , look , there 's no love lost between us . And though I respect the brass it took to make that pitch , I 'm really not into people wasting my time . I hate it . This would be in your best interest . Who the hell is this ? This man has my full authority to negotiate this deal . [ Chuckling ] Negotiate ? Gideon , there is not a chance in hell that I am gonna sell you a single share of this company , let alone controlling interest . [ music ] Let me show you what will happen . [ music ] I 'm sorry . [ Gasps ] [ Groaning ] Oh ! [ Gasps ] Oh , God ! Okay ! I 'll give you what you want . [ Breathing heavily ] Please . There , okay ? Just ... leave ! Leave us alone , okay ? ! Please ! You 're confused . [ music ] I said I would show you what will happen . [ music ] Man : Aah ! God ! [ Groaning ] [ music ] [ Muttering ] Our men are taking control of the building as we speak . Malick : This is what we went to all this trouble for ? [ music ] What do you want with this ? I want you to put it on . [ Chuckles ] - Come on . - Whether you 'll admit it or not , Gideon , the one thing you crave and have never felt is true power ... the kind that I , Giyera , even Charles there possesses . [ music ] Put that on , and you will . [ music ] You still think you should be going . - I know I can do it . - And you think I can 't . I-I have an advantage . I can 't cause earthquakes , but I 'm faster than you . Foresight . I know what 's coming . Then get off your ass and show me . [ music ] You can picture this fight in the security office ? Yeah , I only get to Charles a few seconds late . So , let 's lay out the room as best we can . They 'll be the guards , and you show me how to get through it a few seconds faster . Okay . Yeah , all right . There 's a ... a bank of servers on the left side , and we 'll need chairs on wheels ... two of them and two more bodies . Yeah . Make sure they have a security team watching the house . And buy the little girl something nice . Yes , sir . [ Thumping ] Daisy : No , Fitz , you 're supposed to ... - What 's your name again , man ? - Doug . Doug . You 're supposed to come in on the heels of Doug . - Okay . - And , Lincoln , I 'll just ... I 'll give you a separate cue to come in . I 'm playing " freak out and go for the alarm guy . " - Good luck with that . - All right , reset ! Right when she opens the door . Ready whenever you are , May . [ Sighs ] [ Grunts ] [ music ] [ Stopwatch clicks , ticks ] [ Both grunting ] - Daisy : Shoot him . - Bang ! [ Groaning ] Please , no ! - Oh , geez . - Bang ! [ Fitz groaning ] Bang ! - Bang ! - Daisy : Under the table ! Bang ! [ Grunting ] [ Ticking continues ] [ whispers ] Simmons . [ music ] - Fall down ! - Sorry . Lincoln , go . Grab the knife . [ Stopwatch clicks , ticking stops ] Wish we could practice every moment of our life like this . - [ Sighs ] That was terrible . Fitz ? - You come right after Doug . Okay , I come in right at the heels of Doug ! And , May , are you telling me that is your best side kick ? - I was trying to miss her face . - This would be so much easier if ... - If I had your powers ? - Well , it wouldn 't hurt . All right , it 's got to be faster . Come on . Reset . Reset . [ Prosthetic whirring ] [ music ] [ Glass brakes ] [ Chuckles ] [ Laughs ] - It does feel good . - Yes . But crushing objects with your hand isn 't the sensation I was talking about . [ Sighs ] Okay . If you want to feel true power ... crush him . No . Please , God , no . No ! What will that achieve ? [ music ] No , no , no ! Gideon , please , don 't do this ! I 'll give you anything ! I did ! I 'm too young to die ! God ! Oh , no ! I know you 've had people killed . You 've even considered shooting someone . [ Groaning ] Hive : But to drain a man 's life with your own hand , to feel the life go out inside him ... as Mr. Coulson did with me . That look in his eyes . A feeling so powerful , it scared him ... enough to leave that hand behind . [ music ] But you don 't fear anything , do you ? [ Groans ] Daisy : Reset . Reset . You don 't think May can conquer this . I 'm just worried about what turn of events - is gonna stop her from going ... - Oh , come on . ... ' cause we already know that she doesn 't . I refuse to believe anything is completely inevitable . We 'll see . [ Sighs ] Ready when you are ! [ Inhales deeply ] [ Clicks , ticking ] [ Both grunting ] Bang ! Bang ! [ Grunting ] Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! [ Both grunting ] [ Snaps fingers ] Lincoln . [ Stopwatch clicks , ticking stops ] That was pretty damn good . Sir , we found the building . - That 's it . - And shocker ... the only way in is through their security office on the ground floor . Transia Corporation ... I know of it , - but what would Malick want in there ? - I used their nerve-wiring interface in your hand , sir . It 's cutting edge , to say the least . - Okay , this is getting crazy . - It 's been crazy . All right , May ... surgical strike . - And we agree ... no comms on this . - Hydra will be listening . And know we 're coming if they really have a fortune-teller on hand . And if you see Charles , do not go up to the roof , even if he ... [ Alarm blaring ] - Uh , what does that mean ? - Intruder . [ music ] He just walked in , sir . Surrendered himself . - Why ? - Lash is taking over . I 'm about to turn for the last time , May . [ music ] I came to say goodbye . Well , at least this day can 't get any weirder . I can 't believe I 'm saying this , but May can 't go . - What ? Yes , I can ! - You heard him . Andrew 's going away for good . You have to ... That man is a killer . I have no loyalty to him . The man that I cared about wouldn 't do those things . Coulson : He wasn 't himself . And now he 's saying he may never be himself again . If you don 't go be with him right now , you 're gonna regret that for the rest of your life . - I 'll do it , May . - Absolutely not . Sir , I 'm the best choice to handle this , and since Bobbi 's gone , I 'm the only one left who can . - You 're not unstoppable , Daisy . - I 'm willing to put that to the test . And test Fitz 's theory that all this will play out - just as you envisioned ? - Everyone else stays back to make sure we 're still altering the end . You , Lincoln ... no one leaves H.Q. Coulson , I can do this . I am meant to save this man . I can feel it . Let me go . [ music ] The assault team will remain on the Quinjet unless needed . Fitz will tap the Transia building 's security feeds to get eyes on you . And remember , we don 't know what happens after that last instant . - It might not be pretty . - I know . Hey . Watch your back . If it goes south , get out . Don 't try to be a hero . And for God 's sake , Skye , come home . - It 's Daisy , sir . - Damn it . Daisy , right , Daisy . Just ... come home safe . [ music ] [ Monitor beeping ] Shouldn 't you be behind glass ? - I 'll get out when I need to . - So , what 's in the I.V. ? Something Simmons has been working on ... a potential vaccine . Never been tested , may not even work , and even then , only on Inhumans who haven 't changed yet . - But since you 're still transitioning ... - So it 's a Hail Mary . It 's a long shot , yeah . If you 're gonna say something , say it , - ' cause I 'm not gonna stay long . - I 'm not here to repair . I know I can 't fix any of it . I just ... I 've been [ Sighs ] thinking it through , trying to think through like a psychologist . - Spit it out . - I wanted to tell you that ... I know becoming Inhuman changed me . - And you needed a PhD to figure that out ? - What I 'm saying is I ... When I said before , that I 'm the same man you married ... That 's not true . - You weren 't a killer when I married you . - I know . I know that now . And a little of him is in me all the time ... that was him talking . And there 's some of you in him . That allowed you to talk me down ? Yes . But this time , when I turn , I ... I 'm afraid I 'll be gone ... forever . [ Sighs ] If you could fix it , if you could change the past , - would you ? - Yes ! But I want this monster in S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s hands because despite knowing my actions were wrong , I still feel that I was doing it all for an important reason . [ Scoffs ] - That 's the monster talking again . - Maybe . But I feel like he 's fighting for a cause we don 't understand yet . And I don 't know . You might need him . [ music ] We 're tapped in . It 's a pirated wireless signal , so touch and go . [ Computer beeping ] [ music ] - Can you find the security office ? - Wait . Fitz : Is that Giyera ? Simmons : That 's him . I 'd know his face anywhere . [ Beeping continues ] You hear what Andrew was saying , Lincoln ? Even he thinks he 's serving some higher purpose . Yeah . Maybe it 's true , then . Maybe Daisy and Charles were brought together for a reason . Could be . Also , could be you all are crazy and this is pointless and nothing we see here will make any sense . What ? [ noise ] [ music ] Was that Ward ? Unfortunately ... I think that 's something else . My God . What is she walking into ? [ music ] Andrew : Would I change things if I could ? You weren 't asking about becoming Inhuman . I was talking about us . [ music ] Every terrible thing that has happened to you could have been avoided if you 'd never met me . [ Monitor beeping ] [ Touchscreen beeps ] I wouldn 't change a thing . [ Sighs ] - I would . - Well ... you 're still the center of the best moments of my life . Whether this vaccine works or not , right now , with you here ... is exactly where I 'm supposed to be . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Both grunting ] [ Panting ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ music ] One-way mirror . [ music ] [ Breathing heavily ] Guess it 's a good thing I was here . - How did you know that ... - We 've been monitoring the security feed . Oh , and by the way , your chances of not going up to the roof just evaporated . Hydra 's already taking Charles there now . Get moving . Okay . Wait . What are you gonna do ? Find Grant Ward . [ music ] Yeah . Day got weirder . They 've breached the security office . Mr. Malick is taking the company 's helicopter , but I 'd rather sneak you out another way if S.H.I.E.L.D. is present . We 'll try to scramble their communications . Should I give the order to kill any S.H.I.E.L.D. agents ? Only if they 're human . So , the security entrance ... north side . All right , let 's go ! - And we ? - We don 't go any closer . We stay here ... without a cloud in the sky . Maybe Daisy didn 't see the future . [ music ] [ alarm blaring ] - Sir . - Ward was here , 20th floor . You two go with Lincoln . Work your way up . We 'll take the elevator and work down . Let 's go . So [ Sighs ] ... now we wait and see , I guess . I 'm sorry to drag you away . Looked like you guys were prepping for a mission . Long story ... though Daisy 's so confident in her ability as an Inhuman , she believes she can change the future . [ Scoffs ] That 's funny . We 're trying to do the same ... [ music ] [ Grunts ] [ Coughs ] [ Groans ] [ music ] [ Rumbling ] [ Groans ] [ Coughs ] Aah ! [ music ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ music ] [ Both grunt ] Power is intoxicating , isn 't it ? And he 's right ... you never really feel it until you take someone else 's away from them . [ Grunts ] [ Groaning ] [ music ] Coulson , come in . - Where are they ? - I just had an awful thought . What if the death Daisy saw was her own ? Coulson : Lincoln , do you read ? All units , stop ! Do not pursue ! - Lincoln , where are you ? - Lincoln : I have eyes on Ward . [ music ] Coulson : Do not engage . I repeat ... do not engage . Lincoln , we don 't know what we 're dealing with here . Pull out . [ music ] [ hit ] [ music ] [ Grunts ] [ music ] It 's time to say goodbye . [ Groans ] [ Whirring ] Ohh . [ music ] [ Choking ] [ whirring ] [ clank ] [ Coughing ] [ music ] [ whirring down ] [ Coughing ] I was sure I could save you . [ Breathing heavily ] - But you were meant to save me . - I finally ... made a difference . [ Helicopter blades whirring ] [ Sighs ] [ music ] It 's not snow . I think we 're supposed to hold hands now . [ music ] Maybe some things are inevitable . [ music ] [ Inhales sharply ] I made this for my daughter . I couldn 't bear to leave them , but ... I had to protect Robin from this . You did . But now I 'm afraid that she could grow up ... to be like me . So she will always need protection . I was hoping you could help . Yes . I 'll protect her , I promise ... always . [ music ] [ Gasping ] [ Alarm blaring ] Ohh ! [ Breathing heavily ] I 'm so sorry . [ music ] Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . I want you to go there . Is that where they manufacture the Exo-Skeleton hardware ? That 's not the technology we are interested in . [ Cellphone rings ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Yes , sir . I shouldn 't have to remind you that you work for me . You 're the head of my security , and you should be by my side at all times , protecting me . No , sir . I 'm right where I 'm supposed to be . [ Cellphone beeps ] Is he all right ? He 's fine , though he sounded a little ... strange . Strange how ? He sounded afraid .

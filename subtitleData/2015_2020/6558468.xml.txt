I need to talk to you . - We 're a little busy ! The plane doesn 't fly itself ! - The infection 's on the plane . - Eric ... Eric ! - We cannot take him with us . - Even if we find somewhere clean ... - Eric ... Eric ... We 'll deal with it when we get there . Wrap them up . Put them in the hold . - We can 't risk spreading this thing . - Tobias ... We have to land . - Eric , the only reason you 're alive is that there 's 40,000 feet between you and what 's going on down there . I mean , look down ... have you seen the smoke below ? - I know . I know it 's a war zone . - Feels we 're flying over a pile-load of bodies . And they 're the lucky ones from the first wave . No one 's collecting the bodies anymore . It 's not a war zone down there . It 's hell . - We have to get the bodies off ! You and ... and Larry , too . - We need Larry . This plane 's barely staying in the air . - You 're not listening ! Think , Tobias ! We 're flying the infection ! You understand what you 'll be responsible for ? What you doing ? - We 're surviving . Like everybody else . - Fuck you ! - He 's gone . - This doesn 't seem real . I can 't believe they 're gone . - It takes a while . It takes a while to sink in . - Do you hear yourself ? How can I keep going when ... ? - They 're not suffering now . They 're at peace . - Do you believe in heaven ? Does it help ? - No . Not yet . But it will . We might not be the same again . - Is it yours ? - Huh ? David 's . - Nuts , Mr. Ayres ? - Kevin ! He 's just lost his family . - Yeah , but he 's still got his appetite . Who knows how long we 're gonna be on this plane ? What are you praying for ? - A miracle . - Give it time ... Just sit still ... Pretend that she 's taking ... - Craig ! - A plane ... did you see ? Who else would be up here ? I thought no flight left after the second wave . - I don 't know . - Could they be hostile ? - I 'll see if Tobias has made contact . Any contact ? - This is flight 86 from London , do you read ? Over . This is captain Tobias Black of flight 86 from London . Do you copy ? Over . - This is flight 108 from Darwin . Captain Terri Holmes speaking . So tonight there 's someone else up here . - Copy that , flight 108 . You 're a long way from home ; what 's your destination ? - Greenland . But we need to make a pit stop as soon as possible . I was going to stop in Europe , but it was ... uh ... - Messy ? - Messy . Switzerland is still clear , but it 's a no-fly zone . - Hmm , I hear they got sugar happy . - Um ... You could say that . - How 's the U.K. doing ? - Bad news , I 'm afraid . Major internationals are overrun . The plane 's seen better days , but it 's uh ... our only option . How are you holding up ? - It 's been a long day . - You 're not doing shifts ? - No , no such luck . My co-pilot ... got shot . Tobias ? - It 's a hell of a journey on your own . - There ... there have been a few . Close calls . Darwin was the last clean city in ours . We got out before the infection struck . headed for Singapore , and it ... it was clear . - Was it ? - We didn 't find out . We refueled and then the military escorted us to their airspace . - You got supplies ? - Fully stocked . Thanks . How about you ? How many on board ? - Uh ... a small and select group . Seven ... passengers ... eight including me . - Huh , sounds cozy . Where are you headed ? - I hear Greenland 's the place to go . - Well , isn 't that a coincidence ? - It is ... um ... Maybe we should pull resources ? - Do you have any resources to pull ? - Rumor has it you 're in need of a co-pilot . - Ah ... And I suppose my side of the deal would be the plane and it all full of supplies ? - Well , now that you mentioned it ... May I escort you to the airport ? - It 's a date . Look , turbulence ahead . - Copy that . - James ? - You said she was dead ! - Jess ? - Jess ! - They 've got a problem . - Eric . - Jess . - Jess ? - Can you hear me ? Jess ? - James ? Is that you ?

They 're headed for Greenland , too . - I won 't make it . - No one gets left behind . - Just wait. no one will know we missed the flight . We need hands to beat the air . The air ... which is now thoroughly dry in smoke . Smaller and drier than the oil . ? - Okay , Tobias . We are making a visual approach . It 's all looking good . Talk us though it , as much as you can . - The runway is clear ... There are no signs of any severe damage . Nearing minimal descent altitude . Gear and flaps down . Preparing to deploy and hit the breaks . - We 'll circle once and prepare to land . I 'll guide you through it . - What are you doing , Kevin ? - Terri ? Do you have contact ? - No . - Okay ... uh ... switch to emergency frequency . On ... on the console to your left it says Emergency coms . Flight 86 this is flight 108 . Please respond . Flight 108 . This is Tobias . Please respond . Flight 108 ... This is ... Terri , please come in ! - Tobias ! We thought you had found another plane and left us . - How 's it looking down there ? - The airport 's deserted . We 'll get out of your way . - Excellent news . We 'll land as soon as you clear the runway . - Good ... we ... are ... clear . So ... This potential co-pilot , what 's her name ? - Well , you know . Tall , handsome , good sense of humor , Eight thousand flight hours ... - Is that all ? Terri , is everything okay ? - Hang on , there is something going on in the cabin . - Shut up ! Shut up ! We 're taking over the plane ! - Tobias , they 're on the plane . Hijackers , infected . - Stay where you are . - No , they 're going after my crew ; I want to help . - Leave the crew . Stay in the cockpit . they won 't hurt you . - Tobias ? - I 'm with you . - Do not land here . Repeat ... Do not land here . - Now , now ... Terri , Terri ... Terri listen to me !

Help me ! - Are you still with me ? - Yeah . - Okay , look above you . There are four red switches . I need you to pull each one of them sequentially . Now ! - Tobias ? ! - Use the red on the engine . Okay follow me . One , two , three , four . Yes ? - Yeah ... - One , two ... Three ... four ... Yes ! Ha ! Hang on ! Up you come ! Now we can ... yes ! Yes ! - Get it ! - Alright ... alright . - Kate ... What happened ? - You don 't remember ? - There was ... . there was another plane . - Let 's get some fresh air . - We 've landed ? - It 's not pretty . - I am alpha and omega . The beginning and the end . The first and the last . So said the word of the Lord . - Our priority is ... fuel . Must be down there somewhere . But ... uh ... I need ... someone to clear up rear economy . - I 'll do it . - Good . Anyone else ? How about some fuel ? - I 'm not leaving my wife . - You can help Larry . - Fuel ? We need to get supplies ! Find shelter ... This plane isn 't going anywhere . - Larry will sort it . - You 're not listening ! - Eric ! If you 're not going to help us , you 're free to go . - What are you doing ? - I 'll keep watch . They 'll be here soon . - As soon as ... you 're finished with that , I need you to keep an eye on James . It 's a mistake . Let ... everyone go through . - I keep saying ... I could remember more . Larry ... Oh , god , David ! I saw him jump ! Why would he do that ? - I don 't know . Why didn 't he bring his family with him ? - Maybe they were infected . What about you ? Did you ask anyone ? - No . I moved around a lot with work . It 's hard to keep in touch with people . Do you think they keep the fuel trucks in there ? - It 's worth a try . - Monster ! - Stay back . Stay back ! Help me ! - That 's enough , James ! - No ! - Let 's go ! - This way . Come on . - and a complete lack of coordination ... This week , the world health organization issued another warning as the second wave of the infection spread . ... trying too little or too late to prevent more spreading ... The source of the infection is still unknown . ... the scientific community their billions on pharmaceutical companies ... and countries where inappropriate use of antibiotics ... . has led to an antimicrobic resistance . The late doctor David Scott of the SEPSIS France , was the last person to speak properly about the infection before the infection reached Geneva . - There is no known treatment . Resistant bacteria that evolved the ability to withstand attack from antimicrobial medicines . This infection ... is fatal . - This infection is spreading ... . - Craig ! You must bear in mind that we are trying to focus our efforts and resources on finding treatment for this infection . Excuse me . - Europe can 't policy strict isolation ... - Screwdriver . - What are you looking for ? - Something to put Jess ' body in . - Ha ha ! Tobias thinks he 's going to a country club . Oh ... When in doubt , always pick a six . - You 're supposed to be helping Larry . - Hey ! Hey ! Stay down . - We 're not infected ! - On your feet , both of you ! Hands ! - We 're telling the truth . - Let me see you . What are you doing here ? - We landed in the 747 . What 's your name ? - Clarkson . - Kate . We just need to refuel and then we 're taking off . - You won 't have have long ; anyone from miles would have seen that plane land . - Why were you shooting at us ? - Chances are you 're infected , and it 's better to shoot on sight . Put you out of your misery . - We 're no infected ; you can trust us . We 're going to Greenland ; you should come . - I 've got a boat not far from here . Why don 't you come with me ? I 've got supplies for two . - She 's with us . - You think this poor excuse of a man will protect you when the infected hoards arrive ? - I can look after myself . Don 't . - Suit yourself . - You better go with him . - I should take the gun . To be safe . - The gun 's staying with me . - Are you with me ? - Eric ? Are you alright ? It 's me , Kate . - No , no , no ... we need to go back to the plane . - What ? Why ? - Eric . It was Eric . He sabotaged the plane . - What ? - I remember . Before we landed , I saw him in the hold . He tried to kill us . - Paul ! I wanted to ... thank you . - What for ? - Out there . Saving me . - I didn 't save you . I saved her . - Come in ? - Go ahead . - I can see the plane . - How many on board ? - Can 't tell . There 's someone keeping watch . - Um ... - I heard a gunshot on my way here . Should have got closer . - Stay where you are . The others will join you as soon as they can . - Understood . - I 'm gonna go see if the keys are in there . - Yeah , good luck with that . - Where 's Eric ? - Did he find fuel ? - No , is he with you ? - He went with James ! - There 's no way you 're gonna get through that chain . - Hopefully I won 't need to . Give me your ... ? Please . Eric , can you ... - ... interests of national and international duties . It is requested that all survivors do not attempt to travel , as this lengthens the risk of the infections spreading . - Are you sure ? - He was tearing the place apart . - He wanted us to land . - I don 't know what he 's playing at now . You said he went with James . - You have to find him . - If he 's alive . - Where 's James ? - We were attacked . - Enough ! - He followed us . - Eric , enough ! You nearly killed us ! - You wouldn 't listen . You were gonna spread the infection ! - Don 't you want to survive ? We all make sacrifices . I 'm ... I 'm trying to save humanity ! - He 's insane . - As long as you keep flying around , you 're taking the infection with you . We 've got to stay here ! Contain it ! - One more step , Eric ... - You 're not a hero , Craig . You 're an idiot ! - Why 'd you let him go ? I would have just shot him . - You would have missed . We 're gonna need those bullets . - We 'll be with you soon . Wait for my signal . - Received . - How long do you think we have ? - I don 't know , we 'll have to keep watch . - We 've been on the ground too long . - I 'm doing all I can . You know the last words of Captain Benjamin Briggs ? - What ? - They find this ship floating in calm waters table set for high tea . Six months ' supply in the hold . - I haven 't got time for this . - But they couldn 't find a trace of his ship 's crew , in the clear warm waters . Not a single bone . Why would a man jump from a lifeboat ? - Because he 's weak . - Did you see the flares ? - There 's a crowd on their way . - So , what do we do ? - Those flares have signaled our position . We 're gonna have a fight on our hands . - It 's James ! - We 're closing in on them . Maria ! - Get out of the truck ! Get off ! Let 's go ! Out of there ! Let 's go ! - No ! - Come on , people , shoot ! It 's not safe ! Stop shooting ! - That truck is full of fuel , you bloody idiot . - What do you want me to do ? Hey , I 'm taking to you ! That 's my wife , man . - I know . - Get your wife back on the plane . - How many more of you are there ? - Just three of us . Jess , Brian and me . - Brian ? - The one you shot in the head . Can you walk ? Go on . Well , keep walking ! You don 't want me to change my mind ! If I see you again , I will kill you . Who will come ? And they will know where to find us . - It 's Eric . - Go and stop him . We 'll refuel as fast as possible . - Don 't leave without me . - Yes . Yes . - Tobias ! - You have my word . Kevin ! I need you to bring that fuel truck closer . - I 'll do it . But I 'm not doing it for you . - Fine ! - And ... I 'll need that gun . - Get over there ! - Who are you ? - I 'm trying to protect you . - Are you alright ? - Katie ... Katie ? Don 't be scared of the dark . It just hides the shadows we weren 't meant to see . My mum used to say that to me . Don 't trust Tobias ... loyalty 's lost on witless men . - I got a gun . - We 've run out of bullets . - How can you be sure ? - There are a few hundred on the way . Armed . - We 're taking the plane ! - Where 's Craig ? - He 's gone after Eric . - But we need to go ! - Tobias said he 'd wait . - Tobias ! - I need the runway lights ! - Get to the tower and turn on the runway lights ! - Hey ! Kill him ! Kill him ! - Now who 's gonna fly the plane , huh ? Any pilots out there in the forest ? Get him ! - We need him alive ! - I wouldn 't do that if I were you . - Eric ! - Line up . Facing the truck . Move ! Now ! Move ! I 'm not gonna ask again ! On your knees . Knees ! - Please ... I have a family . There 's plenty of room on that plane . I 've heard there 's a cure ! - There 's no point ! He won 't listen ! - I warned you . We have to go . There 's more on their way . - The runway 's blocked . - You 're saying that they will wait for ya ? You really think they care about anyone else ? - Don 't wait for me . - What happened ? - Tobias . - Oh God - I 'm so sorry . Come with me . We don 't have long . Maria , we have to go ! - Then go . You were right all along . There 's no God . Just you . And me . And I 'm not going to say goodbye . Do you hear me ? I 'm going to stay here . With you . Until the end . - Maria is staying . - Her choice . We need to get going . - What about Craig ? We can 't go until Craig is on board ! Are you listening ? We 've got to wait ! - We have no time . We 'll have ruins . - We can 't leave him here . David ... That 's why he jumped . - What ? - You wouldn 't wait for his family . - Come on ... - If you move that , I 'll blow your head up . Do you think I won 't ? Tobias ! Wait for him ! You promised ! - We 're out of bullets . - Crap ! No ! Come on ! Ah , fuck ! Hey ! Hey ! They 've gone . - Craig ! - Larry ? Larry get up here ! Larry ? Larry ? There are two red switches above you ; do you see ? Larry ! Are you listening to me ? The end

 Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck . " You 're only as rich as you feel . " Save me from this . - Who 's that ? - Big-shot gold bullion dealer called Vincent Lermontov . There is a ... legend ... about a bracelet like yours . I heard it long ago . I was meant to give it to someone else . He 'll come after you ! I 'm looking for Harry Clayton . I went to the Green Dragon casino . I think they 're running a fixed roulette table . I 've won money on one of these tables ! 70 grand . I need you to , hum , look after it for a while . I 'm gonna need somebody I can trust . I am your eyes and ears , sir . D.I. Orwell 's going to be joining you on the Hatton Garden case . Come on ! Where is it ? - Tell me where it is ! - Relax ! Where 's the diamond ? Go to hell ! Wait ! Who are you ? I said : stop ! You 're gonna shoot me , Harry ? He 's here ! Fuck ! Police ! Can I have a name and address , please ? I am Kate Olsen , of F.R.S.A. , 5 Pipe Square , Canary Wharf . Think someone 's coming to hurt me ! Keep your calm , Miss Olsen . Police are on their way . Could you tell me exactly where in the building you are ? Miss Olsen ? - Please ! Please ... - Hello ? Police station ... Hello ? Original air date : 2016 , February 12 Sync and subs by mielb My heart 's beating way too fast for its own good . But I don 't care . Nothing else matters . Nothing can go wrong . Not when the universe around me is so in sync with my every move . And I know with outright certainty that tonight ... is my night . That each turn of the car , spin of the wheel , roll of the dice , my fortune 's gonna change forever . It 's time . Time for everyone who ever doubted me , who belittled me , who despaired of my losses , to bow down at my kingship , and glory in my brilliance as I win it all back , and keep on winning . Amen . That 's how every night starts . Come after ' em , it 's all gone down the toilet . Believing in good luck ... is madness . Takes to all of us . That 's why we 're all here . Great speech , Harry . Thank you . Let 's wrap up and say the steps out loud . Step one : I have a gambling addiction . Step two : I am placing my faith in a higher power than myself . I think this is the dumbest thing you 've ever done , Harry . I 'm aware of that . I won that money on a crooked roulette wheel . You don 't know that for sure . I know that the woman who was with me that night is a criminal . The woman who gave me this . Then why did she give it to you ? I don 't know ! All I do know is that ... I 'm alive . I could easily not have been alive . Maybe I shouldn 't be alive ! I 'm glad that 's all clear , then ! The total from ... Lau 's jet is reported to be about 10 ... [ Applause , cheers ] Excuse me one second . How is the head ? My good looks ! Listen , I gather it was looking pretty grim for me back there before you ... Risk life and aimed to save your arse ? I 'm kidding . Yeah ... Anyway ... Thanks for that . Any time . Oh and how 's it going with the two in custody ? Er ... yeah ! Alright , the ... The leader Nelson , he 's ... he 's keeping stone but ... the other one , he 's 19 years old . Gonna lean on him for the last member of the gang . You ... you nearly had him , didn 't you ? We 'll need a description . They were wearing helmets to be fair . Yes , it 's hard to talk it through with you . Winter wants to see us both , now . Wah ! Ho ! Finally ! Some love from the big man ! I am Kate Olsen , of F.R.S.A. 5 Pipe Square , Canary Wharf . Think someone 's coming to hurt me ! 999 call , 9 : 24 pm last night . Kate Olsen works for the Financial Regulation Security Authority , investigating bad traders . There 's been no sign of her since that call . Which would mean this is a murder , without a body ? We 'll treat it as a high-risk missing person with a significant threat of murder . So , am I back as S.I.O. ( Senior Investigating Officer ) on this ? You charged into highly explosive situation without any thought , against all our planning , and yet , your actions saved Orwell 's life and recovered a priceless gem stone , so ... while the Grady inquiry progresses , I 've decided to put you on another case ! I gather it 's the popular choice . Do I get a reward for finding the diamond ? I was offered a job in a place like this once , as a bonus trader . I bet you were , with your brilliant kind of girls , they 'd be mended by now . Nothing unusual here . No sign of any kind of disturbance . But she specified she was in this office when she made the call . We need to find out who else was in the building then . Yeah or who followed her in . This building has a pretty impressive security system . You can 't get in without a pass . This is Kate Olsen , coming in at 7 : 45 last night . And you were in the security room all night ? Yeah . And you checked the four 80-tapes for Olsen leaving ? She 's not on them . There 's no record of Olsen 's pass checking out either . But she 's not in here now , so how could that happen ? Beats me . Can you check the CCTV on the 15th floor at ... What time did she make the 999 call ? 9 : 24 . 9 : 24 . OK . These are all the screens on our corridor . Wait , wait , it 's just jumped 10 minutes . Rewind . I don 't understand . OK . Play . Here ! See ? 10 minutes ! OK , bring up the CCTV on the underground car park and the emergency stairs at 9 : 24 . We need to get forensics to check over all this property . No , I don 't understand ! Why have you let him come back as S.I.O. ? He saved your life . He 's a hero to the guys out there . But we know he 's rotten . Knowing 's not the same as proving . It 's about time you pay a visit to Lily-Anne Lau . Lily-Anne Lau ? We need a physical record of what went on between Harry and her father . I keep thinking I 'm seeing Ben everywhere . Is that weird ? No . I 've tipped off of me and mine advice about the Green Dragon roulette tables . What ? I 'm not letting Lily-Anne Lau just get away with this . Hello . I 'm Brett Stonewood . Kate Olsen 's boss . In the past few months , Olsen has just been working on one case . If I 'm honest , we 've had concerns about Kate for quite a while now . What do you mean ? Kate 's behaviour has been ... erratic . This case started to consume her . She started chasing down obscure foreign leads , sometimes punching in a week later . So the fact she 's missing doesn 't surprise or worry you ? I didn 't say that . Who 's that ? I know him . Vincent Lermontov . Yes . He 's the former CEO of the company Kate was investigating . He died ... two weeks ago ? By jumping off the needle building . Yes . Why would she investigate in him ? Vincent Lermontov was a gold bullion dealer . He bought and sold huge quantities of gold . Kate became convinced that ... he was too good at it . But I 'm guessing she didn 't convince you . We work on evidence ... And ... there was none . What does that mean " too good at it " ? Kate thought that Lermontov 's results were beyond all probability . That basically , Vincent Lermontov was just ... too ... Too lucky . Who runs Lermontov 's International now ? His son , Paul Lermontov . Kate had an appointment to meet him , last night . Just before she went missing . I only found out about it today . She never told me about it . [ Phone beeping ] Sorry . I 'm sorry , I have to go to this meeting but ... you will keep me up to date , please ? OK ? Sir , madam . This is the flat of someone with no interest apart from their work . One to use , one to wash . Anything ? - She has type-I diabetes . - What ? This is an emergency Click and go kit . She 's to maintain her glucose level with regular carbs or eat some sugar or she 'll get woozy and loose consciousness . What happens if she doesn 't have it ? She 's in trouble . - Fentanyl . - Yeah ! Forensics found tiny traces all over on Olsen 's desk . Serious as an anaesthetic , you can get it on the black market . Someone knocked her out . We went to Olsen 's flat . We found syringes and cylinders . We think she 's prone to hypoglycaemia . If Olsen 's glucose level drops when she 's under , the kidnappers will have to act fast . Maybe that 's the point . The perfect murder is a murder we can 't prove . All they would have to do is deny her any food , sugar and ... just wait ! If that happened , it 'd be very hard to prove she didn 't die naturally . Can I get on with my job , please ? I thought you did this for fun though ! Listen , will you try to make sense of all the charts and figures in Olsen 's files ? I 'll be next door if you need me . Jesus ! 24th of April 1986 ... [ Phone rings ] Harry ? Get on line . I need you to look at something . You 're unbelievable . Aaahhh ! Mum ! That looks very very similar . Who 's this dude ? He 's a dead dude , Vincent Lermontov . He 's a gold bullion dealer billionaire . Look at the dragons . And the extra long yang line . It 's definitely the same Ming Yun bracelet . You know what , Harry ? Now that I 'm awake , I 'm 100 % sure . It 's definitely the same bracelet . Yeah . I thought so . [ Phone beeps ] Hold . I gotta go . Anna 's on the other line . Bye . Anna ? [ Phone rings ] What have you got ? You can partially disable the F.R.S.A. building from the cable room in the basement , but it 's not easily done . Check the CCTV on the roads out the Isle of Dogs . If we 're lucky , we might isolate the vic in the same time frame . Copy that . There 's a young woman . She says she urgently needs to speak to Harry ? [ Knock on door ] Oh , thanks for coming by ! She 's really worried up . What the hell happened ? She says she saw someone in the street . I ... I don 't know if she 's lying ... Daddy ! Daddy ! I saw a scary man looking at me ! So I hear ! Alright ! It 's alright . Where 's Harry ? You 've just missed him . When will he be back ? I 'm sure he won 't be long . I work with him . So , hum ... Why don 't we start with your name ? Eve . She fell asleep holding my hand . She always used to do that , remember ? You really don 't have to stay . She won 't wake up now . Listen , I don 't think it 's safe for you to stay here . I don 't think she saw anyone , Harry . She just misses you . I 'll feel a lot better if I stay here . I 'll sleep in the armchair . Our hero . How do you know Harry ? I don 't want to talk to you . I need to see Harry . Now . Why don 't you tell me what the problem is , and I 'll call him . - You can 't help me . - Look , wait ... I can see you 're in some kind of trouble . Let go of me now . Tell him he doesn 't have to believe in me . He just has to believe in it . Time 's run out for me . Who is this Eve ? No idea . Well , she knew who you were . I think I figured out what made Olsen so obsessed with Vincent Lermontov . Oh yeah ? The price of gold always goes up when something very bad happens . Like Tott ( enham ) beating ( Manchester ) United ? No . Like wars , natural disasters , big stuff ! These 3 dates are when Lermontov made his biggest investments in gold . Read them out . 21st of December 1979 3 days before the Soviets invaded Afghanistan . 24th of April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster . 10th of September 2001 , the day before 9 / 11 ! Lermontov bought 100 million pounds worth of gold , his biggest ever investment , things worth 8 times as much by the end of the year . Olsen believed that Lermontov knew these things were gonna happen ? If she did , then she really was crazy . No-one could have known . Let 's go see the son and heir . - Hello . D.I. Clayton . - Good morning . Please . Follow me . Nice seagull ! It 's an albatross , dummy . Mr Lermontov will be with you shortly . Thanks . He has the best view ... in the best city in the world . I do , don 't I ? Shame I don 't appreciate it . My eyes are hyper sensitive to light . Have been since I was a kid . Right ... So how do you live in the tallest building in London with floor to ceiling glass ? This is my father 's flat . Your father died recently , didn 't he ? On his 70th birthday . He went up those stairs , climbed onto a balcony and jumped . Did you know my father , detective Clayton ? No , I didn 't . Really ? I thought you must have met him . We 're here about Kate Olsen . She went missing two nights ago . Really ? You met with her that night . What did she want to talk to you about ? Kate Olsen was obsessed with my father and his business , to an almost pathological degree ! She wanted to speak to me about the same thing that she always did . Probability . The probability that my father couldn 't be this successful . Maybe she was right . People like Olsen didn 't understand that the harder my father worked , [ Phone rings ] the luckier he got . Excuse me . Hello . Just give me a second . That 's a remarkable bracelet you 're wearing , detective . It 's ... Tang dynasty , isn 't it ? Hum ... So I 've been told . And where did you get such an incredible piece ? I plunked down the wrong food market . Your father had so much . Why do you think he felt the need to kill himself ? That 's the thing about luck , Harry . It always balances out in the end . Anna , hi ! It 's me again . Just trying to make sure everything is OK ? Hum ... I 'll try again later . OK , bye . Everything OK ? Daisy thinks she saw a man outside the house last night . What have you got ? We tracked this from one of the roads out the Isle of Dogs . Check the time line 42 , 8 minutes after the black-out . Was the SUV registered to an address ? Canal boat on Regent 's canal . [ Glass shatters ] This is it ! I can 't see anyone inside . We have no warrant ! We have no time ! Kate ? Kate ? Close those . Kate ? Kate ? Hand and leg ties cut . She was here . Jesus ! What does insulin smell like ? Er ... Band-Aids . I don 't know what that is . Have a look through there . Anything ? [ Loud thumps on the roof ] What the hell is that ? There 's someone on the roof ! What the hell ? Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Jesus ! We 're on fire . Check the windows ! She 's locked up a chain - -- Harry ! Do something ! What ? Harry ! Suri ! It 's OK . Come on . Come on ! We need to get you out of here now ! I 've got you . Come on ! Oh ! God ! I 've got you . Sit here . Breathe . Breathe ! [ Sirens approaching ] OK ? What exactly are you and your boss asking me for , detective Orwell ? We 're asking for your cooperation . That is sweet . But I think you 're asking for a little more than that . If such a document existed ... showing the financial relations between my father and Harry Clayton ... and I 'm not saying it does , how can you guarantee it won 't be used against me ? It would only be used as evidence in an internal investigation into Clayton . Nothing more . - I have your word on that ? - Yes . And there 's no question of my father 's murder investigation ever being open again ? No . Food for thought . I have to see what I can find . Oh hi , Anna ! I 'm just heading out . - It 's a very quick question . - Sure . How did we get Kevin Grey 's case ? What do you mean ? Well , I 'm just wondering who paid for us to take him on ? Why does it matter ? Clearer than that . I expect Grey paid for himself . I never thought he could afford it by himself . Well , I 'll have a look and get back to you on it . It 's that important . Thank you , Nathan . SOCOs are at the boat now . Not that there 's much left of it . - You OK ? - Hum ( yes ) . For a moment there ... I thought that was it then ... Olsen found something up about Lermontov that 's worth killing for . What then ? [ Phone rings ] Sodium thiopental . What ? The syringe you bumped at the canal contained sodium thiopental , which has a variety of anaesthetic uses . But forensics think the concentration in the syringe is similar to that used by the Soviets as truth serum . Soviets ? They were interrogating her . So we know they kept her alive . Yeah , until they find out what she knows . Right , we 're dealing with a different operator here , you know , someone with serious military training . ... formerly in a relationship with Ms Fenchurch ... with the other victim Lau ... Hi there ! I just want to make sure that Daisy is OK . She 's at my mum 's . You shouldn 't be here on your own . Well , you 'd better come in then . I spent the whole day worrying , thinking that I should have been here last night when Daisy got scared . - You were . - Yeah , but ... I mean I should have been here with you , protecting my family . I think I 'm doing a pretty good job at that myself , thank you very much . Yeah , but you know what I mean . Can we start all over again ? No , seriously . I 'm serious . We can get it all back . - How ? - I can get it all back . I promise . You were always short on self-belief . True . Why I fell in love with you in the first place . Yeah . Listen , you should probably go . - Yeah . Five minutes . - Yeah . What are you hiding , Kate ? [ Phone beeps ] I gotta go back to work . OK . But ... when I 'm done , I 'll ... I 'll come straight back and we can ... - Harry . - spend proper time together . Harry , Harry . What do you think just happened ? What do you mean ? Well , do you think everything is OK again between us ? Well , yeah , I mean ... What ? Because we went to bed together ? Well , why did you then ? Because I was lonely . Well , me too . I mean , we can move on from here ... Harry , nothing 's changed ! We still have to move out from this house on Monday . You 're still a compulsive gambler who could lose everything that Daisy and I ever had for ourselves . You said you gotta go ? I met an old man in Kirov who swears he knew Vincent Lermontov before he became Vincent Lermontov . Vincent Lermontov is actually Vincent Zolin , a railway worker and hired hand for the Kirov mob ... He killed a notorious Moscow KGB boss when he was 23 ... 9th of April . Went to see Brett Stonewood at the Landor Hotel . He told me my new information about Vincent Lermontov was false . He advised me strongly to take it no further . Stonewood brought a new F.R.S.A. agent to our meeting . Tall , bald , Russian accent . I heard rumours that you 'd given up gambling . That 's true . I have . 800 . Then you must be the ghost of Harry Clayton . Winning very big today . Gambling 's for losers . That 's why I 've given up . Can you beat a flush ? I 've often heard it said . Once you stop caring , then , you can really start winning . - Harry , your money ! Burn it ! Stonewood was actively trying to get her off the Lermontov case ? Yes , but she kept going regardless . Still , he tried to intimidate her by bringing a new F.R.S.A. agent , some tall bald Russian guy . Jesus ! Where are you now ? Just outside the F.R.S.A. I 'm going in . - Wait for me . I 'm nearly there . - There 's no time . Suri , I said , wait for me . That 's all I 've been doing . Suri ? Shit ! You lied to us . - I told you everything you needed to know . - No ! You deliberately withheld what Olsen found out about Lermontov . Police . Kate Olsen 's crazy theories have no bearing on this at all . It 's why she was taken away and you 've known it all along ! That ... is a very serious accusation to lay at a senior F.R.S.A. officer , D.S. Chohan ! Excuse me , what do you ... ? Oh ! - Where is she ? - What ? Kate Olsen is about to die out there , and you 're an accessory to her murder . - No . - Who was the Russian bald man you took to that meeting with Olsen ? I don 't know . I was never told ! But he wasn 't an F.R.S.A. officer , was he ? - Was he ? - No . Where is she ? I don 't know , I promise ! You told him about Olsen 's hypoglycaemia , didn 't you ? Explained that all they had to do is deny her sugar and she would die naturally . And then , when they dumped her , it would look like poor mad Kate Olsen had a tragic accident . You have no evidence that I did anything out the law . You 're under arrest . Suri , grab his things . I think Lau is gonna help us . And did she give you the impression this record existed between Harry and Freddie Lau ? She hinted that this was just the start of what she has on Clayton . I mean this goes back a long way . Where is Clayton ? He 's questioning Brett Stonewood in interview 1 . I 've uncovered some files showing he was complicit in Olsen 's abduction . Olsen was so paranoid she encrypted all the intel she gathered on Lermontov . I managed to decode some of it . She certainly had plenty of information to indict Lermontov . Stonewood then handed Olsen to him on a plate when she wouldn 't drop the case . Anything else on Olsen 's whereabouts ? We just know they 're interrogating her somewhere , trying to find out everything she knows . Our only hope is they won 't let her die until they 're sure they have everything . Well , dead or alive , she 's probably out the country by now . Border controls have been on high alert since the 999 calls . They 'd have to smuggle her out another way . Shipping containers . Lermontov has a shipping company called Albatross International Freight . Based at Canary Docks . Services freight to Russia and the Balkan states . That 's where Olsen is . Get Clayton , get over there . I 'll sort a warrant . Harry , how the hell are we going to find her in here ? Harry , we can 't just drive around like this . She 's here somewhere , I know it . Yeah , but where ? [ Radio PA ] Harry . Come in , Harry . Come on , come on ! Where are you ? Harry , We need to interview all the crane drivers . We haven 't got time . - Well , then what 's your plan ? - I 'm placing my faith in a higher power . Great ! So you have no plan . Come on , come on ! Christ ! Where is she ? That 's it ! I have a visual , stick with me . Orwell , get her down ! Kate ... Can you hear me ? She 's alive ? Jesus ! What the hell ? Eve ? She 's alive . Just . Imagine my surprise . I spent last three weeks looking for you all over town . So why don 't you introduce yourself , and say why you spent so much time trying to meet me ? Who I am does not matter . What really matter is who are you and why are you wearing that bracelet . Detective , father , ex-husband , brother , compulsive gambler ... And there was high hope that you got the wrong man . But you are wrong man . She should never have given that to you . It is why she has to die . - It 's all her fault . - NO ! Eve . Eve . You know so little about bracelet , Harry . What ? I can not kill her before I kill you . Tell him why . - Tell him ! - He won 't understand . Tell him . Tell me ! Eve , tell me . I 'm the only one who can remove the bracelet . Da . You see it 's too late for me to just chop your hand off . Because the bracelet is joined to him now , isn 't that right , Eve ? You 're making a mistake . It 's not the real bracelet . I thought you would say that . This is why we 're going to test it out now . Vincent used to play this a lot . But then ... Vincent really was ... one hell of a lucky man . Anyone can beat just one bullet . Well , keep going , Kojak , or you don 't have the balls ? Oh I have balls . But you have " ming yun " bracelet . That 's a cheap piece of tin ! It doesn 't mean anything ! And what do you think saved your dress rack , ha ? In that river ? Let 's face it , Harry , before you got bracelet , you weren 't very lucky man . I don 't feel very lucky now ! Vincent used to be a penniless worker on Siberian railway . But then one night , he accept the contract to kill one of most dangerous men in Moscow . But even Vincent didn 't realize that his ... ultimate reward would be Eve 's mother coming to visit him ... with that very same bracelet . You 've no idea what you 're playing with , Becker . Which is why you 're going to burn in hell . 50-50 . This is where it gets interesting . Believe in it . That 's the thing about luck . - Daddy , daddy , I saw a scary man .

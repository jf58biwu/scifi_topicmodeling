 We were born in space . They told us the ground was uninhabited . But they were wrong , and we 've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed . Some of us have been broken by it , but most of us are still here , searching for other survivors from the ark , trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness ... a home . Our leaders believe that to survive , we need to make peace with the grounders , but peace is a foreign concept here . Clarke : I 'm not going in . Clarke ... Seeing their faces every day is just gonna remind me of what I did to get them here . May we meet again . We 're going to the city of light . Take this leap of faith with me , John Murphy . A.L.I.E. : Welcome , thelonious . I 've been waiting for ages . My name is A.L.I.E. I tried to stop her . I 'm so , so sorry . Voice : Containment door sealed . Come on . Come on . Come on ! Man : Chris , where are you , man ? Chris ? Chris ? Chris ! Different man : I knew it . The news was wrong . It wasn 't china . The stupid son of a bitch let A.L.I.E. Out . Help me . The radiation 's coming . Unless we want to share this place with a corpse , we need to get him outside . Come on . Ugh ! Arrgh ! I tried to stop her , but I lost control . I 'm so , so sorry . 2051 . Becca , meet A.L.I.E. Chris , I got to get back to work . We are working . A.L.I.E. wanted it to be a surprise . Hello , Becca . Who did this ? I did . You don 't approve ? As you know , I didn 't think I needed an avatar . You did . Why not my creator ? Why not my creator ? Why not my creator ? Please state your core command . My core command is to make life better ... To make life better ... To make life better . Becca : How would you do that ? By fixing the root problem . Waah ! By fixing the root problem . By fixing the root problem . Rebecca : What is the root problem , A.L.I.E. ? Too many people . Um , too many people ? Too many people . Ah , well , you certainly took care of that , didn 't you ? Yaah ! 86 days , on my , um , last box of food , so ... really never thought I 'd miss the ark this much , but anyway , Jaha , if you 're seeing this , that would indeed mean you 're not dead , so screw you ! Oh , come on . I ... mm ... Voice : Containment door released . Wait ! Get back here . Uh ! Uh ! Jaha : John . There you are . - Jaha . - Welcome . We have so much to talk about and so little time . I found it , John . The city of light is real . You let me live ! Ok . Uh ! Oh ! Ah ! Uhh ... Ohh ! Yah ! Hah ! Huh ! He had me , but he was too aggressive . Whatever you say . Quitting so soon ? Mapping run , sector 7 . Harper , let 's get this over with . Council wants you to have that . I 'm trikru . Uniform doesn 't change that . This is our home now , Lincoln . We fought for it . Too many of our friends died for it . In the ark , the uniform meant something different . Down here , it means what we make it mean together . My sister will understand that eventually . Pair up and fight now . Hey , sector 7 , that puts you right at the ice nation border . Yeah . I know . Just because Azgeda was part of the commander 's coalition , doesn 't mean they respect the cease-fire . - I should be on that scout . - I wish . We all do , but until the commander agrees to lift the kill order on you , you 're more trouble than you 're worth . This is the first sleep the chancellor 's had in two days . I 'll be quick , then . We 're going into sector 7 . I think we should arm the entire unit . Permission granted , but the rules of engagement still apply ... nonlethal response . Copy that . Bellamy , there hasn 't been an attack since mount weather . It 's 3 months . Our people believe that this is real peace . Try not to screw that up . Yes , sir . Abby : He 's come a long way . It 's a work in progress . I was dreaming we were in the ark before we sent the kids down . Maybe she 's in sector 7 . We could send out another search party . They wouldn 't find her , not unless she 's ready to be found . Sir . Ma 'am . I have patients to see . Sir , we just got a signal on a secure channel , 3 clicks . 3 clicks . She wants to meet . Monty , why aren 't you ready ? I am . He 's not . What should we do ? We should leave him this time . He 's not getting better . Maya 's death broke him . He needs this . Take an arm . - Come on . Uh ! - Ohh ! Uhh ... Gina : Zeke , I said produce first . Art doesn 't go bad . Monty , he 's all yours . Hey , easy run ? I hate that place . I know . Got you something , though . You said your mom used to read this to you . Thought you 'd like it . I do . Thanks . Raven : Hey ! Take it easy . Good morning to you , too . Ah ! Uh ... What 's the point if we can 't shoot them ? We can , just not to kill . That goes for everyone . Where 's Octavia ? We 're going outside the wall . You honestly think she 'd miss that ? Ah ! Sorry . Was that too cold ? Aah ! No gun for you , not till you 're sober . Don 't want one . Let 's do this . Mm ! Uh ... Mm . Be safe . - She 's too good for you . - Shut up . Jasper : Careful . Monty might melt her . Enough ! Raven , take us out . Guess we found her . Try to keep up . Hah . No way . If you 're gonna ride shotgun , you can 't just disappear . Hey , it 's ok . It 's a long ride . Aah ! Whoo ! Tracking beacon from the ark . Hey , that was the best part . Who is it ? Farm station . What ? After ... after 4 months ? How ? We 'll find out . Where are they ? Don 't tell me I missed the party . Sector 8 . That 's ice nation . What about it ? Protocol says we go home , let the chancellor decide what to do next . Screw protocol . The chancellor 's not from farm station . Monty is . So is Miller 's boyfriend . It 's your call . Let 's do this . You have to ask ? Try to keep up . Yah ! Jaha . Hey , wake up . A.L.I.E. : Thelonious isn 't here , John . He 's in the city of light . I know what you are . It 's refreshing to be around people who understand technology again . Let us explain . That 's a good idea . Why don 't you start with why you kept me locked in a bunker while you were here living like a king ? The outside world means nothing . In the city of light , we 're all kings . Here I thought I was the one losing my mind . A.L.I.E. : It 's the truth . I can show you . Ok . You do know she 's the one who launched the bombs that ended the world , right ? Wrong . She didn 't end the world . She saved it . I 'm so out of here . Let him go . He 'll come around . These woods must be the border . So where 's all the ice ? Much further north . Azgeda stretches for a thousand miles . Good thing we only have to go 200 meters . Slow down . Remember , rules of engagement are nonlethal force . Tight formation on my command . - Raven , you stay in the rover . - Yeah , right . We need every gun we 've got . Monty : They 're coming . 120 meters ... 110 . They 're our people . What are you doing ? We hope they 're our people . On my command . Ice nation ? Yes . White war paint . Whoa ! Stay calm . _ Skaikru . _ _ They think we 're looking for wanheda . - Who 's that ? - I don 't know . Monty : The light . That 's the beacon . Hey , get back here . Monty : Jasper , what are you ... what are you doing ? - Jasper ... - It 's ok . I got this . Tell them we observe the commander 's truce . Do it now . This belongs to us . _ _ _ _ Hold your fire ! Jasper , get down . Hah ! Kane , on radio : Rover one , come in . Repeat , rover one , come in now . - What now ? - Bellamy , where are you ? I had him . What the hell were you thinking ? We got the beacon , didn 't we ? Uh ! Yeah , but where did they get it ? Oh , he needs to get to medical . Bellamy : We had to shoot 3 ice nation scouts . Covert , sector 4 . Copy . Can you tell me what 's going on ? Kane : When you get here . Over and out . Raven : Sector 4 ? Why is kane so far outside the wall ? Bellamy : Take him home ! I 'm fine . Thank you for asking . - Miller ... - Yeah ? Get one of their horses . Raven , since you can 't ride , you 're on the back . Monty , you 're with me . - Let 's go . - Ok . You were right about Jasper , ok ? Is that what you want me to say ? Quiet . Keep your eyes peeled . I could 've said no . He 's getting worse , isn 't he ? I mean , getting drunk every night is one thing , but smiling with a knife to your throat , that 's next-level damaged . Who 's he with ? - Indra . - That 's Indra ? He must 've told her we broke the truce . Sir , before you say anything , there was a good reason ... we 'll deal with that later . This is about Clarke . - What about her ? - She 's being hunted . - By who ? - By everyone . Aah ! Uh ! Ah ! Uh ! Uh ! Ow ... _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Man : Open the gate ! Octavia : Jasper 's hurt . What took you so long ? Oh , what happened ? Ice nation . Nngh ! Get him to medical . I got you . Keep pressure on it . Clarke ? _ You want me to take them ? It 's ok . I 'll ... I 'll bring her in . You can 't get down , can you ? Ok . Come here . Ah ah ! Ok . Uh ... Ah . Uh ! Thanks . - Raven ... - I 'm good . I 'm still getting used to it myself . Monty : Sir , we 're almost out of range . Are you sure you don 't want to tell the chancellor ? I 'm sure . I don 't want to worry abby until we know something . We know there 's a kill order . You people are big on those . Indra : It 's not a kill order . It 's a bounty . Clarke 's a symbol . She 's known as wanheda ... the commander of death . The ice nation guys we killed asked about wanheda . They 're looking for Clarke . Why ? My people believe that when you kill someone , you get their power . Kill wanheda , and you command death . She 's just one girl . So was the commander . What clarke did at mount weather weakened her . The ice nation is emboldened . Their queen wants Clarke 's power . If her people believe she has it , she 'll break the coalition and start a war . I can 't let that happen . Welcome to sector 7 . Where to now ? If she 's here , she 'll need supplies . We 'll start at the trading posts . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ I would wait , give them the chance to clear out . Have that drink . Why are you helping me ? My mother was taken by the mountain . You ended the reaping . You wanted to see me ? Yes . I 'm considering making another run to mount weather for medical supplies . You want my advice ? That 's why you 're here . The last one just got back . If it looks like skaikru is colonizing the mountain , the truce will break , and we 'll be at war . Jasper , wait . Whoa ! He hasn 't been discharged . - I 'm fine . - He 's not fine . Shut up , Raven . Ok , ok . Enough . If you promise to come back in the morning , I will examine you then , ok ? You 're just gonna let him go ? That 'll be all , Lincoln . Thank you . I 'll be in there in a minute . Abby , we have 12 patients waiting , including 4 contraceptive implant removals . You 'll be right in . Abby , he had a knife to his throat , and he smiled . I want to talk about you , Raven . How 's your hip ? You don 't have a broken compressor , do you ? When did the pain start ? After the explosion at the dam . 3 months . It 's nothing I can 't handle . You 're not handling it . You 're lying to your friends . You 're lying to your doctor . You pushed wick away because he was trying to help . - Don 't . - Raven , you don 't ... Fix yourself , Abby . Maybe if you weren 't so busy being chancellor and doctor to avoid your own pain , you 'd realize you suck at both jobs . Good talk . The cat got the worst of it . No kill marks . My back 's not big enough . Tell me about the mountain . There 's nothing to tell . I did what I had to do . That 's all . That 's all ? You killed our greatest enemy . You wiped them out by yourself . Niylah , would you mind not talking ? No . Mm ... Oh , yes ... _ _ Hey . _ _ There can 't be an us or them if we want to survive . You 're being naive . Those people aren 't like you , Lincoln . Kane and abby aren 't like most people . They 're trying to forge a lasting peace , and so am I. They 're using you . " Look at that nice grounder in his uniform . " They think it proves we can live together . It does . What if I don 't want to live together ? And don 't tell me about the kill order . We can go far away . Luna 's clan will take us in . No . They won 't . Luna 's hiding for a reason . She won 't risk the attention . Hey , hey ... _ Hey ... _ _ And nothing can take that away from us . That uniform does . You 're leaving , huh ? So are you . Not with you , I 'm not . I 'll be right there , Gideon . Murphy : I see you 've made a new friend . I 'm sorry we kept you in the bunker , John . Is that what you want to hear ? Well , the truth is , I knew you were safe , and with all the things that we had to do , I needed the time . Yeah . I could tell you were pretty busy back there . We converted a nuclear warhead into a power source . With the added power , A.L.I.E. Was able to complete the work she began with her creator a hundred years ago . Whatever . Look . I 'm still leaving this place in a rowboat . I need you . Of course you do , more food for the sea monster , right ? Let me prove to you what we can do . Listen to me . I 've seen what she can do . No . You haven 't , not even close , son . Now , how is it possible you sound even Crazier than before ? I can tell you about the city of light , but you won 't understand until you experience it yourself . And that 's supposed to take me to the city of light ? No pain , no hate , no envy . No , thanks . - John ... - No . Pain , hate , envy ... those are the abc 's of me . Hey , get rid of them , and there 's nothing left , so why don 't you get that thing out of my face ? Take care of yourself , John , and decide later . John ? I don 't believe it . Emori ? What are you waiting for ? Come on . - Change your mind ? - Bite me . Emori , who 'd you steal the boat from ? A.L.I.E. : Told you he 'd come around . Not so fast . I say we float him . Come on . What do you guys want for it ? One song . Done . You were right . I am spread too thin . I 'm still not having that operation . Raven , that 's ... Are you here as my chancellor or my doctor ? Because I don 't want to talk to one of you . I 'm here as your friend . Good . Shut up and drink . Hey , hey , relax . These belong to people . - So did that piano . - Jasper . Jasper ! Grave robbers ! Get off of him ! Hey . - Ok . Stop . Stop . - Take it easy . Enough ! We have to move it . Wait . It 's been cut down . Bellamy : You don 't know that . We do now . Hello , Wanheda .

 Sean : AMERICANS . WHEN THE DAY OF JUDGMENT COMES , WHERE DO THEY SEEK REFUGE ? A SHOPPING MALL . MacDOWELL RECKONS THERE ARE 10,000 IN THE AREA . HE SAYS 5 % OF ' EM MAY BE IMMUNES LIKE US . 15 MILLION AMERICAN IMMUNES , JUST WAITING TO JOIN THE CAUSE . Net : YEAH , AND HOW MANY OF THEM ARE GONNA GO FOR YOUR " WE ARE THE CHOSEN " ACT ? IT AIN 'T NO ACT . NED . IT AIN 'T NO ACT . FINE . GOOD , LOOK , SEAN , THE LABS ARE GONE . THE BOYS TOOK CARE OF THE ONES IN LISBON AND ISTANBUL . THE ONLY CURE THAT 'S LEFT IS SITTING ON THAT NAVY SHIP . IT 'S THEM WE SHOULD BE GOING AFTER NOW . ACHILLES AIN 'T NO USE TO US UNTIL WE REPAIR THE SOUND MATTING WE SCRAPED OFF IN THE CANYONS . ONCE WE 'RE GOOD AND QUIET AGAIN , IAN WILL GET HER MOVING AND RESTART THE HUNT FOR THE DESTROYER . AND I SAY WE JOIN HIM AND THE REST OF OUR CREW INSTEAD OF MUCKING AROUND IN THIS BLOODY SWAMP . COME ON . LET 'S KILL THOSE NAVY BASTARDS AND THEN BUGGER OFF BACK TO ENGLAND . HAVE YOU HEARD A BLOODY WORD I 'VE BEEN SAYING ? NED , I HAVE A PLAN . IT 'S A SHIT PLAN . NED . RUNNING FROM TOWN TO TOWN , WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE VIRUS , AND THEN PICKING THROUGH SURVIVORS LOOKING FOR PUNTERS LIKE US . NED . I HATE THIS PLACE . THE HEAT . WE SHOULD BE HOME LIVING THE LIFE . AND WHAT 'S HE STILL DOING HERE ? IF IT WEREN 'T FOR NIELS , WE WOULDN 'T HAVE FOUND THAT DOCTOR DOWN THE COAST AND THEIR LABS . YEAH , ALL RIGHT . THANK YOU VERY MUCH ! WE DON 'T NEED HIM HANGING AROUND NOW CREEPING PEOPLE OUT . HE 'S LIKE THE GRIM REAPER . THAT 'S ALL PART OF THE PLAN . NIELS ' SPECIAL TALENT 'S THE THING WE 'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR . THAT REAPER 'S GONNA HELP US FIND MORE IMMUNES JUST BY BREATHING ON THEM . Rachel : MY LAB IS LOW ON JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING . ONCE I HAVE DEPLETED THE CELL CULTURES ON HAND , WE WON 'T BE ABLE TO MANUFACTURE THE VACCINE ON THE SHIP . [ DOOR CLOSES ] ANYTHING ON THAT SUB ? NO . FOR ALL WE KNOW , THEY 'RE HALFWAY BACK TO ENGLAND BY NOW . KEEP WIDENING THE SEARCH AREA . FARTHEST ON CIRCLE FROM POINT LAST SEEN - - 24-HOUR RANGE . SIR , IF I MAY , TO CONTINUE THE SEARCH , WE 'RE GONNA BURN THROUGH ALL OF OUR FUEL . WE 'LL TOP IT OFF IN NORFOLK OR MAYPORT . THERE 'S A NAVAL WEAPONS STATION IN CHARLESTON . WAIT - - EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING , BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE LONGER WE SEEK OUT THIS SUBMARINE , THE FURTHER IT TAKES US OFF OUR MISSION . WE NEED TO REBUILD THE LABS OR FIND ONE WITH ENOUGH STOCK OF CELL CULTURE . WHERE WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE GO ? WHICH LAB ? GO ON . PICK ONE . PHOENIX - - DESTROYED , NO SURVIVORS . SALT LAKE - - DESTROYED , NO SURVIVORS . MADISON , TOPEKA - - GONE . BALTIMORE . BALTIMORE , WHICH I SO CLEVERLY ADDED TO THE SECRET LAB NETWORK - - GONE . FLORIDA . EVERYTHING WE WORKED FOR ! CAPTAIN , DO YOU NOT THINK I 'M AWARE OF THIS ? I HAVE SPENT THE LAST 20 HOURS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED , HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED . BUT WE NEED TO STAY ON COURSE OR MILLIONS MORE ARE GOING TO DIE . THAT SUB IS THE MISSION NOW . WE 'LL FIND THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS , AND WE 'LL MAKE ' EM PAY . T.A.O. , SONAR , NOTHING ON SUBSURFACE . ROGER THAT . Oliver : [ Laughing ] I CAN 'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE . Max : NO , YOU GOT TO LISTEN . STOP , STOP . YOU GOT TO LISTEN . NO , STOP . STOP , I CAN 'T . SO THE FIRST MATE SAYS TO THE JUDGE , " I 'LL HAVE YOU KNOW , A SAILOR I AM NOT . " [ LAUGHS ] OI ! ANYTHING ON THAT DESTROYER ? NO , MATE . COME ON . QUIET AS A CHURCH MOUSE . JUST ' CAUSE THE BOSS IS OFF SHIP AIN 'T NO EXCUSE TO LOLLYGAG . KEEP LOOKING . ALL RIGHT . NED WANTS RESULTS . YEAH , ALL RIGHT . DON 'T " ALL RIGHT " ME . I 'M A GODDAMNED WARRANT OFFICER , CLASS 2 . AYE , SIR . WITH HIS KNICKERS IN A TWIST . SHUT IT ! [ LAUGHS ] Alisha : IT MUST HAVE TRANSMITTED TO THE SATELLITE RIGHT BEFORE THE ATTACK . HAVE YOU WATCHED IT ? ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT IT WAS FOR YOU , MA 'AM . BUT EVEN FROM WHAT I SAW ... IT WASN 'T EASY TO WATCH . [ BEEP ] [ RAPID GUNFIRE ] RACHEL , OH , GOD , I PRAY THIS GETS TO YOU . LISTEN , WE 'RE - - WE 'RE UNDER ATTACK , RACHEL , BUT IT 'S IMPORTANT - - IT 'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU LEARN THIS . I 'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DATA YOU SENT ME ABOUT THE CURE . AND I THINK I FOUND A WAY TO HELP . [ RAPID GUNFIRE ] USING WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT THE MEASLES PROJECT - - NOW , I KNOW YOU THINK THAT 'S CRAZY , BUT IT WORKS . I 'M SENDING YOU THE DATA NOW . IT 'S HERE . LOOK , I DON 'T - - [ BANGING ] OH , GOD . LISTEN , RACHEL . IT 'S ALL WORKED OUT . ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS - - I JUST SOMEHOW PRAY THAT THIS FILE GETS TO YOU , THAT YOU GET IT OFF THE SERVER , RACHEL . MacDowell : OKAY . GOT TO KNOW THAT ... RACHEL . [ CLATTERING ] COME ON , NOW . TAKE IT ALL . WE NEED TO FIND THAT SERVER . OKAY , DOC . NO . STAND UP . PLEASE . PLEASE . [ GUNSHOTS ] Slattery : WELL , THAT 'S HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE LOCATIONS OF ALL THE LABS . STOLE THEM FROM DR. HUNTER . HE WAS WORKING ON AN EXPERIMENT TO TURN MY LIQUID INJECTABLE VERSION OF THE CURE INTO A POWDER SO IT COULD BE RELEASED OVER POPULATED AREAS VIA HELICOPTERS , PLANES , DRONES , EVEN . I COULD MANUFACTURE A HIGHLY CONCENTRATED POWDER RIGHT HERE ON THE SHIP . WE WOULDN 'T EVEN NEED LABS ANYMORE . SO PEOPLE COULD BREATHE IN THE CURE . IT WOULD BE VERY MUCH LIKE CROP-DUSTING . MASS INOCULATIONS WITHOUT GLASSWARE , NEEDLES , ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE . DO YOU THINK HUNTER WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO IT ? I KNOW THAT HE HAD SOME GOOD RESULTS AEROSOLIZING THE MEASLES VACCINE , BUT I WON 'T KNOW UNTIL WE GET DOWN TO HIS LAB IN FLORIDA . THE FORMULAS ARE LOCKED AWAY ON HIS COMPUTERS . ABSOLUTELY NOT . IT 'S A LONG SHOT , AND WE 'VE GOT BIGGER FISH TO FRY RIGHT NOW . REALLY ? BIGGER FISH ? AND BY THAT , I ASSUME YOU MEAN REVENGE . BY THAT , I MEAN WE 'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL WE TAKE OUT THAT SUB . THE MEN WHO KILLED HUNTER , THEIR ACCENT - - THAT WAS IRISH , RIGHT ? YES . MEANS THE SUB COMMANDER HAS PEOPLE ON THE GROUND . ACHILLESWAS 200 MILES OFFSHORE WHEN IT LAUNCHED ON THE LABS . NO WAY THEY WERE ABLE TO SLIP BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN FLORIDA . DR. HUNTER 'S LAB LOCATION WAS HIDDEN ON THE SECURE SERVER . THE BASTARDS NEVER GOT THE FLASH DRIVE FROM THEIR MAN . SO HOW 'D THEY FIND IT ? IT DOESN 'T MATTER . WHOEVER KILLED YOUR FRIEND IS LONG GONE BY NOW . THIS IS A WILD GOOSE CHASE . IF ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS - - HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN WHAT WE 'RE ALL DOING HERE ? FIND THE CURE , SAVE THE WORLD . REMEMBER ? CLEAR . PILOT : There 's a TAC headed to the east wing . Nathan James , Sabrehawk One leaving the landing zone . Vulture Team in place . ROGER , SABREHAWK ONE . [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ INSECTS BUZZING ] CLEAR . CLEAR . WOLF : More dead doctors in the east wing . NATHAN JAMES , VULTURE TEAM . WE GOT WHAT WE EXPECTED . ROGER , VULTURE TEAM . [ SIGHS ] HE WAS A GIANT . THE SMARTEST MAN I KNEW . Cruz : MA 'AM , THEY SHOT UP THE DOCTOR 'S OFFICE PRETTY GOOD . BASHED THE COMPUTERS TO BITS . I 'M SO SORRY . [ SIGHS ] [ SNIFFS ] I FOUND THESE CULTURES . SO AT LEAST WE CAN CONTINUE MAKING THE CURE FOR NOW . SEE IF THERE 'S ANYTHING IN THAT BOX TO HELP . DID YOU FIND ANYTHING THAT LINKS TO THE SUB ? ASIDE FROM HOW GOOD THESE GUYS ARE AT KILLING ? NO , SIR . SIR , THEY CAME IN QUIET . CUT THE LOCK AT THE NORTH GATE . BUT THEY LEFT IN A HURRY AND DROVE RIGHT OVER THE FLATTENED FENCE . THERE ARE MUDDY TRACKS TO FOLLOW . SIR , MAY I SPEAK FREELY ? ALWAYS . LET 'S GO . SIR , WE 'LL TAKE DR. SCOTT BACK TONATHAN JAMES SO SHE CAN FINISH HER IMPORTANT WORK . COME WITH US . WHOEVER DID THIS MAY HAVE ALREADY SWEPT THROUGH EUROPE , AND WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO GET A FOOTHOLD HERE IN AMERICA , AND WE CAN 'T KEEP LOOKING OVER OUR SHOULDER FOR THAT SUB . WE FIND THEM , WE MAKE IT SAFE FOR DR. SCOTT TO FINISH HER WORK . THIS IS ALL THE SAME MISSION NOW . FAIR ENOUGH . BUT I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES , SIR - - YOUR DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE . SO I 'M ASKING , AS A MAN WHO IS NEVER MORE THAN 509 FEET FROM HIS CAPTAIN , DON 'T LET THIS SUB BECOME YOUR WHITE WHALE . MILLER ! CRUZ ! AYE , SIR . GO WITH THE MASTER CHIEF , GET DR. SCOTT BACK TO THE SHIP . THE REST OF YOU WITH ME . CHIEF TAYLOR , FIND US A VEHICLE . WE NEED TO FOLLOW THOSE TRACKS . YES , SIR . LET 'S GO .

YOU SEE , NED ? DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN NIELS ? OH , NED . I PASSED A DEPARTMENT STORE , AND I WAS THINKING THAT , LIKE , MAYBE YOU AND SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS COULD GET SOME FRESH CLOTHES , IMPROVE THE SMELL ON THE SUBMARINE , MAYBE ? [ GLASS SHATTERS ] DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK , SEAN ? ! I THINK THIS IS A DODGE ! I THINK IT 'S AN EXCUSE TO DUCK OUT OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME ! YOU 'RE AFRAID ! YOU ARE AFRAID TO LEAD ! YOU ARE AFRAID OF THAT DESTROYER ! AND THAT 'S WHY WE 'RE STUCK ON THIS BLEEDING ROCK ! SAY THAT AGAIN , BRUV . TELL ME I 'M AFRAID . I AM CULLING THE HERD , NED . AND THE PURE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO JOIN US . THOSE WHO REFUSE MY BENEFICENCE WILL DIE ALONG WITH THE CREW OF THAT NAVY SHIP . NOW , YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE . DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME ? OR DO YOU WANT TO JOIN OUR BELOVED MOTHER IN THE GRAVE ? WELL ... NOW YOU 'VE COME TO MENTION IT ... DO YOU THINK BEYONCé 'S IMMUNE ? EH ? I MEAN , IT 'S POSSIBLE . 5 % AND ALL THAT .

IF IT WERE ME , I 'D HEAD INLAND . YEAH , BUT NORTH OR SOUTH ? THAT 'S THE QUESTION . SIR , U.A.V. AT 5,000 FEET , 30 MILES NORTH OF VULTURE TEAM . NOTHING FOR MILES . IN TH- - IN THOSE SWAMPS , YOU 'D THINK WE 'D GET A HEAT SIGNATURE OFF AN ALLIGATOR OR SOMETHING . NAH , GATORS ARE COLD-BLOODED .

POWDER BASE BRINGS WITH IT ALL KINDS OF COMPLICATIONS . WHICH IS WHY NO ONE 'S BEEN ABLE TO DO IT . IT 'S UTTERLY ORGANIC , COMPLETELY SIMPLE . MISSING JUST ENOUGH PIECES TO DRIVE US CRAZY SOLVING IT . IT 'S THE SAME SHAPE AS CYCLOHEXANE , A DRY-CLEANING SOLVENT . IT 'S WAY TOO TOXIC . I HAVE TO ASK . IS IT - - IS IT POSSIBLE THAT DR. HUNTER NEVER SOLVED IT HIMSELF ? NO . HE SOLVED IT . HE GAVE HIS LIFE TO TELL ME . GREEN , TAYLOR , TEX , TAKE THE SOUTHERN FLANK . LIEUTENANT BURK , LIEUTENANT BIVAS , YOU 'RE COMING WITH ME - - WE 'LL CIRCLE AROUND FROM THE NORTH . AYE , SIR . LET 'S MOVE .

 Previously on The Shannara Chronicles ... ERETRIA : You said we 'd help them across ! Bring a demon with ' em ? The hell with that ! I guess my first owners were pretty eager to unload me . And who knows about my parents ? I 've heard of places like this - buildings from the Age of Man . This is how we find the Bloodfire . - Your father is dead . - ( CRIES OUT ) ' ( ROARS ) " No ! ALLANON : Now you are king . - ( CREATURE SHRIEKS ) - WIL : Let 's go ! - ( CRIES OUT ) - AMBERLE : Eretria ! - She 's out there alone . - WIL : We 'll find her . ( FOREBODING MUSIC ) My friends will find us , and you 'll be sorry when they do . Your friends took off and didn 't look back . Stop ! What is that place ? Human settlement . But how ? This is Troll country . They 'd be slaughtered . - Move . - MAN : OK , let 's go . ( CHATTER ) ( CHILDREN LAUGH ) ( GOATS BLEAT ) Any interest in these ? Of course . The maps , this atlas , all of the books . What about her ? ZORA : Trust me . You don 't want this one . I 'm gonna trade her in Grimpen Ward . Pay off some debts . She was after this when I found her . Seemed pretty important . OK . I 'll take it . And I want the girl . Girl 's not for sale . OK . I changed my mind . Put it all back . Tye , we had a deal . Not anymore . Not unless you sell me the girl . I 'm not for sale . She 'll cost you double . ( INHALES SHARPLY AND GROANS ) - Sold . - The wound 's infected , Tye . She 's worthless if she dies . Well , then , Frances , let 's get her to the infirmary . ( GROANS ) What are you doing ? Let me go ! - I need to find my friends . - Shh . Relax . It 's gonna be OK . You 're in Utopia now . ( GAS HISSES ) SONG : ♪ I feel it running through my veins ♪ And I need that fire ♪ Just to know that I 'm awake . ♪ ( DRAMATIC MUSIC ) Amberle , wait up ! Hey , wait ! Last track we picked up was over a mile ago , OK ? We need to gain some ground before her trail goes cold . - We need to rest . - We need to find Eretria ! Amberle , stop . She thinks we 've ran off without her and that she 's alone , again , and I 'm not gonna let that happen ! - Why are you yelling ? - I don 't know ! You feel guilty . I get it . So do I. But we can 't get distracted . - We have a job to do here . - How can you even say that ? You 're the one always saying we can 't let our feelings get in the way of our mission . You need to rest , Amberle . I 'll rest after I find Eretria . Stop ! ( CREAKING ) WIL : Probably Trolls . Eretria told me to expect traps out here . I will do anything to find her , but if we want to make it out of these woods alive , we need to be careful . We rest , then we eat . And then , then we keep looking . It 's fading . So fast . Yes . That is why I need to know what you remember . You were in the presence of a powerful evil , fighting for your life . That kind of darkness , it can follow you . I understand your concern . I do . But ... I 'm OK . Who did that ? You . Your gift is powerful , but now the Dagda Mor knows , he will stop at nothing to own your soul . I was nearly your age when my mentor , Bremen , discovered me , alone and afraid . Abandoned by my parents . The Druid trained me in the ways of the order . He gave me purpose and control . And now it is my turn to do the same . I believe you to be the next Druid , Bandon . A Druid ? And what if I don 't want that ? The choice is no longer yours to make . Without training , you won 't stand a chance of surviving the darkness that is about to descend . ( DRAMATIC MUSIC ) ( SINISTER MUSIC ) ( CLATTER ) Pie ? - It 's actually pretty delicious . - Stop it right there . Or I will kill you . A simple " No , thanks " would be fine . You 're not a prisoner . You can leave any time you want . But you bought me as a slave . OK . I understand how this might be a little confusing for you . But I only bought you to save you , from the Elf Hunters . - I don 't believe you . - I don 't blame you . The world out there is ugly , and trusting someone equals death - I get it . My friends will be looking for me . We were separated . OK , then ... I 'll get a search party together . I managed to stop the infection , but you lost a lot of blood . You need to rest , heal . The Wilderun is no place for you to be running around alone . I can take care of myself . I don 't doubt that for a second , but not in your condition . WIL : What are they anyway ? Sentinels mark the border between the known world and the Wilderun . - The point of no return . - Wow . That 's encouraging . The Elvin royal family commissioned them after the First War of the Races , a gift to the Four Lands . A symbol of our newly born unity . But now ? Now I know they 're more than a border . They 're a warning not to cross the Elves . WIL : Look . The Elves have certainly made mistakes . But what we are doing , this isn 't about saving any one race . This is for every one of us . And I think we all deserve saving . I hope you 're right . And ... I want you to know I 'm sorry about Pykon , that I kissed you like that . I thought you were dead , and then you ran in , and I was so relieved - it was ... Amazing . Well , not Pykon , obviously . That was insane . I mean the kiss . Because that kiss that was nothing to be sorry for . Wil , it 's like you said - we can 't let our feelings get in the way . Just so we 're clear , my feelings aren 't in the way . My feelings for you are what keeps me going . SONG : ♪ My love ♪ You know my love ♪ Let it grow ♪ So we can watch it bloom ♪ The love ♪ I know your love ♪ Let it grow ♪ So we can watch it bloom ♪ Bloom ♪ Bloo-ooh-oom ♪ Bloom ♪ Bloo-ooh-oom ... ♪ - ( METAL CLATTERS ) - ( GROWLING ) ( MENACING MUSIC ) ( GRUNTS ) Hey ! Oh . Fancy meeting you here . Elf Hunters , huh ? - Do you know anything or not ? - Of course I do . If it 's Elf Hunters , I know where they trade . He 's lying - he doesn 't know where Eretria is any more than we do . - We 're wasting our time here . - CEPHELO : Oh , what ? You 're gonna leave me here to be gutted by Trolls ? As a matter of fact , I would . You deserve to die alone in a cage like the dirty animal you are . ( GRUNTS ) Harsh . You cut the line at Pykon . You left us to die . - It looks like you made it out OK . - No thanks to you . Let 's go . Hey. mongrel ! How far you think you 're gonna get before some Troll picks up the scent of your pretty princess ? Huh ? ( INHALES DEEPLY ) I can smell her sweetness from here . - ( BLADE RINGS ) - Hey ! Hey ! ( GRUNTS ) Do it ! It beats getting eaten by Trolls . Come on ! ( GROWLS ) Let me loose and I 'll take you straight to Eretria . Do you swear you know where she is ? Cross my cold black heart . And I always keep my word . Oh , you can 't be serious . You think this is some coincidence ? He 's probably been tracking us for hours . About a day now . Can you really blame me , after I 've seen what those Elfstones of yours can do ? If we set him free , then we deserve whatever it is he does to us . Well , if you have a better idea , short of us wandering through Troll territory all night , I 'm all ears . She certainly is . Clearly we can 't trust him , but with someone who actually knows these woods , we actually stand a chance of finding Eretria . ( CHATTER ) We were taught humans were warmongers intent on destroying the world . But humankind was more than that . It was curious and compassionate , brilliant , even . I mean , we built great glass cities and machines that allowed us to travel to the stars . Sounds like a bedtime story . And that is what the Elves want us to believe . What you see here is the first of many colonies , human colonies , all coming together to usher in a new era of man . Human , Troll , Elf , Gnome . They 're all animals . Reading books and baking pies isn 't gonna keep anyone safe . Yeah . You 're right . Follow me . So when we settled here , we were overrun by Trolls . We lost half our people in the first night . Women , children . It was a bloodletting . - Then why stay ? - I was tired of running . And I saw a future here , one that could be negotiated . With the Trolls ? Well , our truce is tentative at best . Keeping us alive requires more than just hope . - What is it ? - They called it a gun . I bought a couple off an old tracker . It cost me an entire harvest of corn . It was worth every kernel . Here . Now , pull that hammer back . Focus on that little line . Point it straight at the target , and , uh ... squeeze . Well ... if I had 10 of you around , those Trolls would not stand a chance . Cross us again and I 'll gut you like the pig that you are . Looks like we have a deal . TYE : What 's so special about this map ? Apparently , the key to saving the world from Demons lies there , in Safehold . Look , I know it sounds crazy , but if you 'd seen half of what I 've seen , you 'd believe me . It doesn 't sound crazy , no more than man landing on the moon . Like that really happened . Look , all I wanted was my life to be my own , to be free . Turns out fate has a twisted sense of humour . I need to find my friends , and when I do , we need to get to Safehold . Well , I 've sent trackers to the Old World , and this map of yours I 've lost three men in that same spot . Only one ever made it back , Hebel , and he 's never been the same . Man with the melted face ? Yeah , we met . Look , I don 't know what 's ahead , but I know I need to get there . OK . Well , then , you should go . But before you do , I want you to see something . Your Highness . You 're drunk . So you ARE magic . - Your Highness ... - No , don 't call me that . This is not my path . Never was . I didn 't want it then , and I don 't want it now . You are the heir . You must ... Abdicate the throne to Kael and the Council tonight at the eulogy . I strongly advise against it . Why ? Councillor Kael battled fearlessly alongside my father in the last war . She 's far better suited to what lies ahead than I. Kael Pindanon hid behind the walls of Arborlon trembling with fear as your father fought alongside Shea Ohmsford . They defeated the Warlock Lord , them and them alone . Oh , good . You know the story I could never hope to live up to . Is this what you want ? To be known as the drunken fool who forfeited the crown ? It 's what 's best for Arborlon . You can walk away from your duty if you wish . But do not pretend that it 's noble or brave . ( CHATTER ) AMBERLE : This is where they brought Eretria ? Alright . Let 's get her . - Easy , tough guy . - What ? This place ? I 've done business with these people . CEPHELO : And something 's not quite right . Then what exactly is our plan ? Your big plan isn 't exactly my problem . Shocking turn of events . Oh , Wil . Come on . ( PATS ) Don 't forget to hide your ears . Wait . You 're leaving us ? What is this , a party ? Yeah , and I want you to do the honours . I don 't understand . Oh , you will in a second . Go ahead . Pull it down . ( PEOPLE CHEER ) ( CHEERFUL CHATTER ) What 's going on ? The surprise isn 't over yet . Tye . We need to find someone else . But , Tye , it 's tonight . We ca ... We need to find someone else . A toast to the incredible progress we 've made here . - WOMAN : Hear , hear ! - MAN : Yeah ! Sown with our own hands , and hearts , working side by side in pursuit of a better future for humans ! ( CHEERING ) We should be very proud of what we 've done here , especially this exceptional apple brandy . ( LAUGHTER ) Now , tonight , there will be music . - ALL : Yeah ! - TYE : And dancing . - ( ALL CHEER ) - And more , if you 're lucky . ( LAUGHTER ) But first , a brief glimpse at our future , something to inspire us all . It is a vision of the life we will build together , of the life our ancestors had before the war . ( PROJECTOR CLICKS AND WHIRRS ) ( CHEERING ) - Sit down . - lf you are referring to the ... ( BOOING ) ... you are correct . The kolinahr is also a discipline you broke to join us . SPOCK : On Vulcan , I began sensing a consciousness ... So , what do you think ? ... from a source more powerful than I have ever encountered . It 's magic . No . It 's man . I believe they emanate from the intruder . - I believe it may ... - ( PROJECTOR STOPS ) ( GENTLE POP INTRO PLAYS ) - ( CHEERING ) - ( TECHNO BEAT STARTS ) ( MUSIC CONTINUES NEARBY ) - Stop right there . - ( DOOR CLOSES ) What 's your business here ? We 're Elf Hunters . We heard we might be able to trade here . Then I 'm afraid we have quite a situation , don 't we ? ( LAUGHS ) Just look at those rags . You can 't wear those to a party . Here . Find yourself something fun to wear and join the party . OK ? ( BOTH EXHALE HEAVILY ) Alright . Come on . Let 's get dressed . Wil , your Elfstones pouch - it 's gone . I know . Cephelo stole it . Come on . We don 't have much time . ( OMINOUS MUSIC ) Like taking candy from a baby . Sleep tight , sweetie . ( DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES ) Let 's split up and look for her . We 'll meet back at the tree line . - Have your scouts returned ? - l 'm sorry ? Your scouts - have they found my friends ? Not yet . Is it possible your friends kept moving , headed to the Safehold without you ? Listen . You can tell me to mind my own business , but can you explain why you 're doing this ? You 'll laugh . I won 't . It 's my destiny . Well , your destiny sounds a lot like slavery to me , Eretria . Your friends want you on their quest . I want you here . But all that matters what is it you want ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's just that nobody 's ever asked me that before . Well ... then you should ask yourself . ( DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES ) Or you could just dance with me . ( DANCE some PLAYS ) - Hey ! Watch yourselves ! - Sorry . Like I said , if he 's not done with that Rover bitch by sunrise , then I 'll kill her myself . ( DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES ) FRANCES : Tye . What 's the problem , Frances ? ( WHISPERS INAUDIBLY ) I 'll be right back . Don 't go anywhere . Wil ? - What are you doing here ? - We came to rescue you . But from the looks of things , it doesn 't appear you need saving . You 're right . I don 't . I 'm OK . So you decided to go dancing . Seriously ? Did you forget what we 're supposed to be doing ? Forget ? How could I forget ? You and Amberle have been telling me what to do ever since we left Arbolon . Maybe I 'm done with that . Done ? Yeah . I want to lead my own life . You won 't have a life if we don 't get to Safehold . None of us will . What 's wrong with you ? - With me ? - Oh , thank goodness . OK , we need to get out of here now . - She 's right . - She 's always right , isn 't she ? What 's going on ? Well , when it comes to this quest , you two have made your choice , but I didn 't . I 've done my part . Now I 'm staying here , with my own kind . Then I 'm staying too . - WIL : What ? - ERETRIA : What ? I 'm not leaving here without Eretria . The Ellcrys revealed you to me . OK ' ? You 're part of this , part of us . You 're confused , Princess . I was in this just to earn some coin . - No , you weren 't . - WIL : Eretria ... You came here for the map , not for me . What map ? The map to Safehold . Now , why don 't you fill your boyfriend in while I go get the map ? I 'll meet you outside in five minutes . And if we refuse to leave ? Then I 'll tell every human in here about you and your pointy ears . You didn 't tell me about a map . I 'm sorry . In all the insanity , I must have forgot . Is that why you were so desperate to find her ? - Because of this map ? - What ? No ! - Are you sure ? - How can you say that ? What kind of heartless monster do you think I am ? To us ! To humans ! Cheers ! ( DARK MUSIC ) You must be Eretria 's friends . It is said that a warrior who dies fearlessly in battle will reap many rewards in the afterlife . If that is true then my father and brother will stand tall before the Holy Mountain , the richest of men . It is time to make a sacrifice in their honour . One that I have discussed with Councillor Kael . I will give ... ( CRIES OUT ) ( SHOUTS ) ( SOMBRE MUSIC ) I will give my solemn vow to battle bravely in the name of the Four Lands . The Demons are coming for us , and we will not back down . I will fight with you , and beside you , as your king ! ( STIRRING MUSIC ) All hail the King . ALL : All hail the King . All hail the King . MAN WITH STRANGE VOICE : Eretria ? ERETRIA : How do you know my name ? Your friends are in danger . What do you know about my friends ? Don 't trust him . Who ? Tye ? Let me go ! You ... Your body is the vessel . Your blood is the key . Don 't let them leave without you . I was looking for you . I said to wait in the barn with the others . You did ? OK , you caught me . I thought maybe we could finish what we started . You sure that 's what you want ? Definitely . Have you done something to my friends ? Utopia 's peace has its price . The Trolls demand a toll each month , and your friends ... ( SIGHS ) .. are gonna pay it , so you don 't have to . So you weren 't saving me . You were gonna what ? Sacrifice me to some damn Troll ? Oh , no , that was before I knew you . Oh , well , in that case ... You belong here , Eretria . With us . I 'll take my chances with the Trolls . I can take you to your friends . Thanks . But ... ( TYE GRUNTS ) ... I 'll find them myself . You can 't leave us out here . - Shut it , Elf . - ( GROWLING NEARBY ) - They 're coming . - Who 's coming ? The Trolls , Princess . I told you there was something not right about these people . Never thought I 'd end up as dinner . We 're being fed to the Trolls ? CEPHELO : And now he 's up to speed . I got a proposal for you , blondie . - In exchange for my freedom . - And what exactly is that ? I 'm talking about Elfstones . The most powerful magic in all the Four Lands . The last hope for the Elvin race . And they could be yours . I 've got ' em right in my pocket . With these , you could be rid of the Elves once and for all . - ( SCOFFS ) Nice try . - What ? Look , the kid must still have ' em . He switched ' em on me . I swear ! Check his pockets . I swear ! Have a nice life , Rover . Well ... for the next 20 seconds anyway . - Let 's go . - ( CEPHELO GROANS ) Well , here 's a thought - since you 've still got the real Elfstones on you , why don 't you show us what you 've got , before that pack of Trolls rolls in and sucks the meat off our bones ? ! Even if I could reach them , they only work on one thing - Demons . - Would it really hurt to try ? - ( TROLL BELLOWS ) Wil ! - AMBERLE : Hurry ! - l 'm trying ! I just ... ( GROANS ) I can 't reach the Stones ! - ( GROWLING ) - WIL : I 'm trying . ( GRUNTS ) No , no , no ! ( BLADE CUTS ROPE ) I 'm sorry for what I said . I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Sorry to spoil the moment , but ... little help here ? - ( BLADE CUTS ROPE ) - Oh , no , no , no ! Do you realise what you 've done ? - Tye , please . - You 've doomed us all . AMBERLE : Wil ! Give me that thing - I 'll hold them off while you guys make a run for it . Seriously , do you think I 'm that stupid ? Kid , if just you could trust me . I got nothing to lose this one time . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I cut the line at Pykon . - I 'm sorry for all of it . - ( ARROWS ZIP BY ) You 're the best thing I ever did . Let me make up for it . Come on . AMBERLE : Wil , come on ! Go . Go make me proud , kid . Go save the world . ( DRAMATIC MUSIC ) ( GUN CLICKS ) ( GROWLING ) - ( WHIMPERS ) - ( TROLLS SNARL ) Tye , what are you doing ? ! Frances ... - TYE : No ! - ( FRANCES SCREAMS ) - ( TROLL ROARS ) - ( SHOUTS ) Now what ? Now we find Safehold . ( PORTENTOUS MUSIC )

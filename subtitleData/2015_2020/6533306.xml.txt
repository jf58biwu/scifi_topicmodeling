I just never - - I 've never seen her with a man . Do you not remember what you did To every boy she brought around the house growing up ? If they just left running , we called that the pritchard . If they left running and crying , Then they got the full sheriff . That was for her own good . Those high-school boys were all bad news . Well , this is one of those high-school boys , So I 'm warning you - - just be nice . Which one ? Wally luskin . Wally the weasel ? ! He dealt weed and - - and he drove a molester van . I bet he got the full sheriff . Look , she hadn 't seen him in years . They ran into each other a few months ago , And they hit it off . She says that wally has changed . She needs this to work . Do you understand ? Uh , duval , you remember wally . I do . Been a long time . It has . Good to see you . And this is my other brother , jimmy , I told you about . Jimmy . Just like your dad . I mean , the - - the name , not - - not that other way . What other way ? Why don 't we order some drinks . Can we - - So , wally , What do you do ? Wally is in law enforcement . I 'm a parole officer . Parole officer ? A p.O. Uh , that 's not law enforcement . Duval : [ clears throat ] It 's a very valuable service To the recently incarcerated . That 's what I told him . You know , wally gets down on himself , But he helps people who need it . [ chuckles ] [ chuckles ] and - - and helen ran all the way home . She did . [ chuckles ] So , we all went around , and we got her some wine . You okay , wally ? Yeah . Everything 's great . Thanks . It 's the best egg foo yung in the city . You 're not hungry ? Duval , come to the bar with me . Let 's get another round , huh ? Anybody want a drink ? Wally : Um , just a beer . Helen : Yes , a beer . Thanks . I think it 's going really well . A parole officer ? That 's not law enforcement . You think she 'd know better than that . Why are we up here ? The waiter could have gotten more drinks . He won 't look me in the eye . You notice that ? Only people with something to hide do that . Leave it alone . [ thunder rumbles ] [ sighs ] wally the weasel . You run a guy off , and as soon as you 're a little bit dead , He thinks he can crawl right back in . [ beeps ] aah ! Arthur , don 't do that . This location is not in your routine . Are you lost ? [ sighs ] I 'm following this guy in the car down the block . Helen and duval thinks he 's changed , But he 's up to something . I saw it . Who 's this guy ? Arthur , can we listen in on that car over there ? My technology is only available to you If you are performing a public service . Is it a public service ? Yes , it 's a public service . I can access the car 's bluetooth . Wally : How many more times ? Jasper : What 's it to you ? I sign my name on your card , says you were with me When - - when you weren 't . Yeah , and you 're getting paid for it . I know I 'm - - I 'm getting paid . What are you moping for , huh ? You got it the easiest in this . You sign your name , and the money goes in your account . Two more days and you 're done . Now , you gonna sign my card ? Arthur , is there any chance you recorded this ? [ beeps ] I have made a digital file and sent it to your phone . Attaboy . Wally : I sign my name on your card , Says you were with me when - - when you weren 't . Jasper : Yeah , and you 're getting paid for it . And don 't get all bill of rights on me . Okay ? I know I can 't use it in court . But helen 's parole-officer boyfriend - - He 's taking money to alibi an ex-con . He 's taking money to say he was with someone when he wasn 't . Did you bring that list of wally 's parolees like I asked ? Yep . Nope . Oh . Uh , no . No . Okay . No . Him . Yes . That 's him . That 's the guy . Jasper willitz - - robbery , armed robbery , Assault , assault with a deadly weapon , armed robbery . This guy runs crews . Look , he did the casino heist in reno . He did the jewelry store in redmond . He 's setting up a crew right now . Wally 's a perfect alibi . I 'll break it to helen . I 'll let you know when it 's over . She 's my kid . I can tell her . My old apartment , huh ? Is it weird that she lives here ? Not as weird as your living in the fake version of it In mary goodwin 's basement . What 's the dvd ? " the notebook . " she likes it . I 'm using it to clean up your mess . I didn 't break my oath as a law-enforcement officer . Lately . Hi . Hey , there . [ sighs ] didn 't want to leave any trace of the old man , huh ? Oh , just the opposite . I actually moved here to , uh , feel closer to him . I think he 'd love what I 've done with the place , don 't you ? Yeah . I mean , he was always asking me To bring him more ... Crystals . So , what is the big announcement ? I can 't stand the anticipation . Well , helen , it 's like this . In life , there are two kinds of people . Wait a minute . Is that " the notebook " ? Oh , my god . What happened ? What 's wrong ? Well , it 's wally ... And , uh , he 's on the take . What ? That 's how you tell her ? Yeah , I mean , band-aid , zip , done . Duval , is that true ? Say it isn 't true . How do you know ? Well , I followed him . And why would you do that ? Why ? He didn 't seem right . Were you looking for something to get him for ? He is breaking the law . Yeah , wow . I thought this was it . I ... I thought wally and I had found each other . Duval , is wally a bad guy ? Yeah . I think he is . You know , when dad kicked him out that time And I stood up for wally ... Dad called me an idiot . My own dad called me an idiot . And you know what ? He was right . He was right . Just go . Both of you . Go ! [ sniffles ] [ door opens , closes ] [ hair dryer whirring ] I got into otto 's lab like connor asked me , And I managed to get quite a bit of otto 's regeneration code . I 'm just sending it to him now . There it goes . Yeah . You feel bad for betraying mary 's trust . I feel bad about betraying mary , But ... Otto threw me out before I was even formed . Connor just said I need to remember why I 'm doing this . And I just need to look at you , and I remember why . Otto , listen , uh , the guy my daughter 's dating - - He 's into something big . He 's being paid off to alibi this ex-con . He - - he 's a parole officer . Uh , the weasel . We call him the weasel . Ja-jasper , his parolee , Is putting money into wally 's account . We just need to find out who else he might be paying . I don 't think he 's listening . Otto ? Otto . Please step away from him . He 's not talking to me now ? He 's not talking to anyone today . Duval : We could use his help To find out where that money 's coming from . Not today . It 's the anniversary of our parents ' death . Otto doesn 't talk on this day . I 'm sorry . [ siren wails ] I 'm sorry to intrude , mary . Let 's go . Go where ? How else do you plan on tracking that money ? This is about your daughter ? It 's about an armed crew Planning a hit somewhere in seattle . But it - - yeah , it 's also about my daughter . And , duval , I 'm assuming this isn 't at the fbi Because he 's gotten you some kind of information You can 't use . That 's the size of it . What 's your daughter 's boyfriend 's name ? Wally luskin . He 's a parole officer . Arthur . Bringing up wally luskin 's financial records . Oh . It 's so illegal I shouldn 't look . Any deposits ? $ 120,000 in the last six weeks in $ 10,000 increments . Jimmy : Any idea where it 's coming from ? The money was moved through various banks , But its source is masked . It is a sophisticated security protocol I am unable to penetrate . What if mr . Pritchard was going to force another transfer from the source ? Yes , mary . The digital trail would be open for a short time . I should be able to trace it . What are you two talking about , force another transfer ? If you can find a way to reactivate wally 's accounts , There might be enough time to trace it back to the source . This is too sophisticated for that thug , jasper . He 's got somebody behind him , Someone who knows what he 's doing . Five years ago , you ran a $ 1 billion hedge fund . Then came the string of duis And finally the vehicular manslaughter . You haven 't spoken publicly until now . What changed , mr . Mellenburg ? Tammi , thank you for asking . The short answer is that I 'm dying , And - - and that clarifies the mind . As you know , I received the maximum sentence - - 25 to life - - And with my diagnosis , I 'll die here . I was angry at the judge who handed down my sentence . Now , uh ... I see he was right . Right in what way ? People need to pay for - - for what they 've done . My time in prison has taught me to be strong ... To be able to face the truth . Without justice , no one is free . Woman : Do you have any remorse Toward the 17-year-old you ran down with your car ? Is helen not coming ? Nope . Thought it would be better To do this just the three of us . Do what ? [ beeps ] Wally : I sign my name on your card , Says you were with me when - - when you weren 't . Jasper : Yeah , and you 're getting paid for it . [ beeps ] I think I might throw up now . Duval : Got two questions for you . What are you planning ? Who else is involved ? I-I don 't know what they 're planning . I don 't - - I don 't know who they are . This place has a soundproofed room downstairs . Do you want to see it ? O-okay , look . A few months ago , that parolee jasper Came to his check-in and said that I 'm gonna sign his card Even when he doesn 't show up . I-I said , " why would I do that ? " He said ' cause they 've already deposited money in my account . He says it looks like I 'm being paid for something , So I might as well go ahead and go along with it . And if you said no ? I did . But then I saw the money was in my account , and I panicked . I tried to go to my supervisor , But I choked because I knew he wouldn 't believe me . 'cause you 're a weasel ? No . Look , I 'm not like you pritchard boys . Your dad was a badass . He would have told jasper to just go and shove it . I-I didn 't know what else to do . Wally ... [ sighs ] you got to come with me . You got to take me in ? I guess I get that . I just didn 't want to lose helen . You know , it took me 25 years to get back to her . After your dad - - when he threw me out , I just - - I kept going . I just didn 't want to lose her . Wait . What if , instead of taking him in , we use him ? Use him ? Yeah , yeah . Play him off against jasper , you know ? Uh , maybe you tell your boss That he was working with us the whole time . Holy crap . You want to save him . He 's weak , duval . He 's not bad . I-I 'm weak . I am , but not bad . I already have a c.I. I 'm having a hard enough time explaining . Mary told me that she could trace the money During a transfer , so maybe wally goes back to jasper , Says he wants more money or he 'll turn him in . It 'll open the door wide enough to trace the funds . Why is helen mad at me ? It 's not my fault she picks lousy guys . Well , it 's not like you were her role model or anything . Hey , I paid for your psychology major . I don 't need it used against me . You and helen both . It 's like you 're trying to ruin this . Ruin what ? First stakeout with my son . Car , snacks . I was looking forward to this . Did I really call her an idiot ? Oh , make up your mind . Either dig in your heels about being right Or feel bad about helen , But this back-and-forth is giving me whiplash . [ motorcycle approaching ] What do you want ? Why am I here ? Uh ... Uh ... You gonna say something or what ? Come on , wally . I 'm starting not to like this . I 'm , uh - - I 'm ... He 's not gonna make it . I 'm turning you in . Yeah , I 'm gonna stop this . No , no , no , no . He can do this . Come on . Jasper : You 're turning me what ? ! Wait . Unless - - [ groans ] ... Unless - - unless you give me double what it 's been . Look , I need the money . Why do you need more money , wally ? I got a woman in my life . Okay ? I want to give her things . Look , if I 'm doing this , It 's got to be double what it 's been or - - Yeah , I 'm turning you in . [ breathing heavily ] [ chuckles ] You got a girl , huh ? All right . I 'll get the money . [ chuckles ] Well . Yeah . He did it . He did . He hit me in the face . Yeah . But I did it . I wish your dad could have seen it . I got a feeling he did . Go to mary . Tell her the money 's moving . I 'll stay on jasper . All right . Ugh . [ beeps ] [ cellphone vibrates ] [ beeps ] Jasper : Hey . It 's me . The parole office wants a raise . Oh , come on . [ horn honks ] [ horn honks ] [ cellphone rings ] [ beeps ] yeah ? Where are you ? We got to go . Some car has been following me for the last couple miles . I 'm taking the long way . You 're being tailed ? It 's probably just a coincidence , But I 'm not taking any chances . I 'm on jasper . Where are we with the money ? $ 10,000 was just deposited into wally luskin 's account . Arthur , you should have some time To trace it back to its source . I calculate eight minutes until the digital trail closes . Tracking now . They 're working on it . Come on , mr . Mellenburg . It 's time for you to get zapped . Let 's get you to your radiation appointment . So , what are you fighting so hard for to stay alive ? If I were you , I 'd lay down and give it up . I fight for everything . It 's how I made $ 1 billion . [ chuckles ] Well , that money 's not doing you any good now , is it ? How we doing ? Arthur ? The security encryption is unknown to me . It seems to have no source . Damn it . I lost him . What ? It 's what happens when you have one car on a tail . We should have a team - - an fbi team . I 'm gonna find out where that money 's coming from right now . What are you going to do ? He can help us , can 't he ? If he were here today , yes . I swear to god you two are from some other planet . He 's right here . Now , you need to wake him up So he can help us find who 's at the end of this money trail . And either you do it or I do , and you won 't want to watch . You should have gone to the fbi . There 's a lot of things that I should have probably done With my life , but that timer says we have 4 minutes left . Aren 't real lives out here more important Than what 's going on in his head today ? I made a promise to my brother - - To protect him . I get it . I thought I was protecting my daughter , But I was just standing in her way . Arthur . I am sorry , mary . I cannot find the source of the money . 7-year-old otto : It 's not gas . It 's plasma . It 's the fourth state of matter . They used to think there were only three states , But now they know the sun is actually the fourth state . Adult mary : Otto , I need you out here . It 's time to let go . Otto . Don 't go to the end this time . Listen to me . You didn 't kill our parents . You can forgive yourself . You didn 't kill them . Come out of the car . You can do it . You can forgive yourself . It 's not gas . It 's plasma . It 's the fourth state of matter . Some superclusters form parts of - - Otto , that 's enough . ... Which are also parts of - - Otto . Shh . I 'd like to go just one day without him talking . [ horn honks , tires screeching ] There 's nothing else I can do . Arthur : One minute left to trace the money . Why does he think he killed your parents ? Otto : Because I did . Prison . Jasper is an ex-convict . That made me think of prison . Prison networks are secured differently . You have to know what it is you 're looking for To trace the hack . Arthur . Prison . Well , can you tell us who ? That 'll take a little more time . I 've traced it to granite hills correctional facility . Here we go . All right . We trained for this . Been to that mile marker every week . Do it like we drilled And everything goes smooth as smooth ... And the money will be in your accounts by the end of the day . According to otto , there are 98 people - - Staff and inmates - - at the prison Who have privileges and access to a computer . He 's gonna narrow it down by the time we get there . [ cellphone rings ] Yeah ? The user is an inmate . Brian mellenburg . I remember that name . Some hedge-fund jackass got all coked up , Killed a woman in a hit-and-run . Brian mellenburg . Mellenburg is being transferred today For his radiation appointment . And something else . He was that man jasper 's cellmate . I used to have six limos , you know that ? One for every day . Biggs : Oh , yeah ? What did you do on the seventh day ? Chopper mostly . Sometimes the boat . But ... You can 't take it with you . You can say that again . What the hell 's going on ? I believe ... My ride is here . [ gunfire ] whoa ! Whoa ! You think if helen knew who I was , She 'd forgive me for what I said ? I don 't remember calling her that . I mean , what kind of father calls his kid an idiot ? Did I ever call you that ? Yeah . But I knew it meant you loved me . Really ? No . Just need a little more time To prepare myself for the softer side of you . That 's a damn prison van . Stay right there . Do not move . Fbi . I 'm fbi . Do not come closer ! You were transporting brian mellenburg , weren 't you ? They took him . Who ? Who took him ? Fake cops . Fake cop car . So you see why I don 't trust you . Just stay right there ! Why is that wheelchair empty ? Because he got up and walked away . Jasper 's rap sheet said robbery . I thought it was a heist . You know , they put this wall street guy In my cell five years ago . I never seen anyone so scared . But I never seen anyone so smart . That first day , after I beat the crap out of him , He says to me , his mouth all full of blood , " you know violence . " [ gunshots ] " you know violence , " he said . " I think we can work together . " And now you 're rich . And now you 're free . One 's for the car . One 's for the cabin . Don 't spend a dime for two years . Don 't change your habits , either . We 're going to replay an interview brian mellenburg did One day before his spectacular prison break . Mellenburg : As you know , I received the maximum sentence - - 25 to life - - and with my diagnosis , I 'll die here . I was angry at the judge who handed down my sentence . Now , uh ... I see he was right . Man , I screwed that up royally . My son 's pissed off , My daughter 's got a broken heart , And that guy on tv 's just laughing at me . Interviewer : Right in what way ? People need to pay for - - for what they 've done . My time in prison has taught me to be strong , To be able to face the truth . Without justice ... No one is free . [ beeps ] Everyone here looks so angry at me , Like I 'm some public enemy . I served my time . Duval : But you 're on parole , Which I 'm about to violate and send you back . On what grounds ? I 'll find something . Or you can tell us where mellenburg is . How should I know ? You have four years left on your sentence , jasper , If I violate you . You 're willing to do that for your old cellmate ? [ cellphone rings ] Jimmy : Duval , you got jasper down there ? Yes . At the fbi , where sworn law-enforcement officers work . Listen , mellenburg - - he 's after the judge who sentenced him . I saw an interview . These - - these wall street guys - - they play for keeps . He didn 't break out just to lay down to die . He wants justice . He wants revenge . The judge . That 's a good theory . Thanks . Listen , you got to do whatever you got to do to protect that judge . You got to find out what mellenburg 's plan is . You got to go real hard on jasper , duval . Like I said , we looked into it . The judge went down in a boat accident eight months ago . Got to go . [ beeps ] [ sighs ] " what is my freedom ? " By brian mellenburg . Most guys lay there in jail , They think about the cigar , The wine , the good meal , and the women . But not me . That 's not my freedom . I 'd lay there and I 'd think about doing all that , Knowing that you , judge - - Knowing that you were right there in a cage . That is my freedom . I got eight months of food here . That 's about how much time I got left to live , And I 'll give you enough to stay alive So that I can watch you ... Every day . And when I get to my end , I 'm gonna open your cage . Keep the chains on you , of course , but open your cage So when I die and the animals come for me , They 'll come for you , too . Yeah , I 've had a lot of time to think . You think mellenburg is paying him To keep his mouth shut ? [ elevator dings ] Can I help you with something ? I 'm a parole officer . I was alerted That my parolee jasper willitz is here for questioning . That 's right . In relation to the brian mellenburg escape ? Is there something you need to tell us about your parolee ? Yes . Uh , my parolee jasper willitz was with me During the time of that prison break . What ? It was a field visit . I signed his card . He was with me the whole time . It 's my obligation to tell his attorney that . I 'll bring him out . Not so fast , wally . My father put you up to this ? Your father ? My brother . My brother . What 's going on here , wally ? I 'm a parole officer doing my job . Pritchard , can I speak with you ? Jasper : What ? You want more money for coming down there to alibi me out ? No . I want to know where mellenburg is , And you 're gonna tell me . Oh , look at the little tough man . [ chuckles ] what , you grow a pair , huh ? No . Brought a pair with him . Uh-oh . I 'm not wally that you can use as a punching bag , am I ? [ groans ] [ crunches ] aah ! Aaah ! Aah ! [ groaning ] I can see it worming its way through your head now . " this guy - - he 's a lot stronger than I am , isn 't he ? " Ask him again , wally . Wally : Where 's mellenburg ? Screw you ! The both of you ! [ grunts ] What do you say we give him the full sheriff , huh ? Wait . What 's that ? See , the full sheriff is when he counts to three And then you start crying . One , two ... Aah ! You 're breaking my hands ! Aah ! [ cellphone rings ] You have him , don 't you ? [ groans ] Well , he wasn 't gonna talk to you , was he ? And he talked to you ? No , actually . He talked to wally . Hey , wally . You tell agent pritchard what you found out . Hi . You might want to get a pen . Okay , you take highway 30 . Get off at the old road . And then , apparently ... [ opera music plays ] [ man singing operatically ] [ rumbling ] [ helicopter approaches ] [ door bangs open ] fbi , freeze ! Freeze ! Drop the knife ! Drop it ! On the ground ! [ music and singing continue ] Get him out of there . Sorry , mr . Mellenburg . We barged in before you could finish it . How did you find me ? Wasn 't me . It was an old man and a weasel who tracked you down . But I 'm the one that gets to put you back in your cage . Get him out of here . What do you want ? He should never have called you an idiot , your dad . Thanks . I 'm sure he said some messed up stuff to you , too . No , I-I don 't think he understood you , helen . You just try to see the best in people , And I think he saw it as a weakness . I saw the best in my dad , Even if he didn 't see it in himself . You know he loved you , don 't you ? Even at the end , You were always his little girl . [ voice breaking ] you 're gonna make me cry . There 's a reason you still feel like he 's around . It ... Oh . Well , it 's a damn ambush . Helen , I can 't explain . I don 't have a lot of time , but you need to come with us . Trust me . I 'll get - - I 'll get my keys . What was going on here ? Emotional honesty , duval . [ indistinct conversations ] Oh . It 's another damn ambush . I 'm sorry I lied . I can 't take it back . And I know I have no right to ask this , But , um ... I have to go away for ... A little while . But I was hoping that when I get back , we could We could start again . Going away ? [ sighs ] for how long ? 8 to 12 months . It 's a good deal . For his cooperation leading to the arrests . Helen , you 're the best thing that 's ever happened to me . I just want to know ... What you said to me then Is it still true ? Will you leave , too ? No . I will always be here with you , otto . Nothing can ever change that . Okay . It 's , uh , time to go now , wally . To jail . Okay . Okay . I 'm gonna go to jail now . Hey , wally , listen , um ... It 's not gonna be easy . You know that , right ? But you can do this . You can be tough . I 've seen you do it . If you ever doubt yourself , Just know that the pritchard boys - - we don 't . [ smooches ] Oh . [ chuckles ] You were so young and handsome .

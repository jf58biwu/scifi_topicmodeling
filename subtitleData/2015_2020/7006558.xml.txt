 - Linus : Guess what 's back ! - Previously on Stitchers ... You have a sister . Her name 's Ivy Brown . Ivy : Your mother is still alive . I shared information with you that I promised to keep secret . You are not the only one with issues at the moment , so back off ! - If something should happen to me ... - Baba ! Samir : I 've always been proud of you . Nina : You need to make a choice . The girl in your mind or the girl standing in front of you . - What do you want ? - I want to be with my mother . Shh . He can hear you . Whoever that is , that 's not me . Entanglement . It 's the ultimate hack ! Stinger 's been running the anomaly on us this entire time . Shut it down , Captain . - Step away from your equipment . - Tim : Excuse me . You haven 't just crossed a line , Baptiste . You 've crossed me . - Linus : Kirsten 's gone . - Then get her back ! - Mom . - Young Cameron : How do you feel ? - Like I 'm home . - Cameron : I want you to hijack it . No matter how long it takes ... I will never leave you . Ayo : She 's ready . All right , stand by . Rebooting all systems in 30 seconds . If this doesn 't work , how much longer can Kirsten last ? She 's not eating , but she 's getting fluids . She could last a few weeks . Yes , what about her mind ? How long can she stay lost inside of it ? - Maggie : I don 't know . - Blair : Well , what does Goodkin think ? - Maggie : He doesn 't know either . - Blair : He 's had three days to figure it out . This is what he 's come up with . Rebooting the entire lab might bounce Kirsten . Well , for your sake , I hope he 's right . You 're all in enough trouble without also killing the golden goose . Don 't make me regret letting you and your men out of the interrogation room . It 's a good thing for you that you did . How 's your son ? Recovering in Germany at the Army Medical Center . I hope I get to see him before you send me off to wherever it is you plan on sending me off to . That one 's on you , Baptiste . You ready ? Does it matter ? Cameron , when this is over , win or lose ... they 're gonna disappear us . You know that right ? When this is over , if Kirsten 's dead , I won 't care . Prepping systems to go offline ! Full system reboot on my mark ! In five ... four ... three ... two ... one . Mark ! Linus : Full system power down ! Blood pressure 's dropping . 107 over 66 . - Not yet . - 98 over 54 . Not yet . 81 over 44 . She 's crashing ! - Cameron ? - Not yet . - Ayo : She 's bottomed . - Cameron . - Reboot . - Systems back online in three , two , one , now . Kirsten , can you hear me ? Blood pressure 's not coming back up . Kirsten . Kirsten ! ♪ Take me inside ♪ Take me inside Kirsten . - Ayo . - Wait . 93 over 62 . It 's coming back up . Kirsten , come on . Come on , talk to me , Stretch . Linus ! She 's still trapped in the memory loop . Damn it . Goodkin , is that it ? I have to find out how my father is doing . I talked to Blair about letting you call out . He won 't budge . - I bet I could make him budge . - Linus . I 'm going crazy ! I can feel it . There 's something not right with him , and ... I don 't know how to explain it , but I just ... I just know . The bond between parent and child is like that . It 's ... I guess it 's like entanglement . The conference room ! Tell everyone ! Please . Quantum disentanglement ? Yeah ! So , what do we know ? Our quantum computer 's entangled with Stinger 's quantum computer . They are bonded without being physically connected , like the bond between a child and their parent . Now , if we could just figure out how to disentangle them , then we could take back full control of Kirsten 's Stitch . Yeah , but we 've been through this . We don 't know where Stinger moved his computer . It doesn 't matter ! It could be a mile away , a hundred miles away . It could be in the next room ! Entanglement is not dependent on proximity . What we need to figure out is the trigger Stinger used to entangle Kirsten . Linus is right . We don 't need to know where he is . We need to know how he did it . How do we do that without Stinger ? His daughter , Ivy . I think she knows something . No . We already questioned her . We even hooked her up to a polygraph . She doesn 't know anything . Well , maybe you geniuses didn 't ask her the right questions . Where 's Fisher ? Under guard in the interrogation room . He was not being cooperative . - Get him . - Nope ! He 's dangerous . Get him . He was there when Ivy was questioned . He 'll know what happened . Or we can just stand around and watch your golden goose die . And that will be on you . - God , Fisher ! - Quincy , what happened ? I wasn 't being ... cooperative . - Are you all right ? - You should see the other guy . I 'm serious . Are you all right ? I 'm serious . You should see the other guy . Get the handcuffs off of him ! No , no . Can 't risk that . I promise I won 't break anymore of your guards . My God , I cannot wait until I 'm done with the whole lot of ya . All right . When Ivy was questioned , did anyone ask her exactly how Stinger trapped Kirsten ? No . It was " Where 's your father ? " and " Where 's his computer ? " Nothing about his methods . Let 's get her in here . Ask the right questions . Linus , you handle this . Find out what she knows . Gladly . I don 't know where my father is . I told you . I told everyone ! I don 't care about that ! What I want to know is how he manipulated his quantum computer to trigger entanglement in ours . What 's a quantum computer ? Would you stop playing me ? What is your problem ? ! My problem is that I am in a situation here ! And the sooner I can find out how your father triggered entanglement in our computer , the sooner I can find out how the hell my father 's doing . What 's wrong with him ? He had surgery a couple days ago . And since we 're in lock-down , I have no idea how he 's doing . - Can 't you call ? - No ! Outgoing calls are restricted and they took away my cell phone . NSA goons took mine away when they brought me in too , except they forgot this . It has a cellular connection . Use it . Call . Find out . And yes ... I know what quantum computers are , and how entanglement triggers work . Now , what is this really all about ? Kirsten . It 's about Kirsten . Maggie : Do you think we can trust Ivy ? I 'm not a hundred percent sure , but at the end of the day , that is her sister dying in there . Hijacking the hijacked signal does make sense . You 've already done that . It didn 't work . Not hijacking the anomaly 's signal . Hijacking Kirsten 's mother . That 's not a signal . That 's a memory . Kirsten 's emotional state is what 's keeping the entanglement active . If we can isolate Kirsten 's memory of Jacqueline Stinger , we can manipulate it . Force a disentanglement trigger to make her bounce . So , you 're gonna save Kirsten with an idea you got from the daughter of the guy who trapped her . Do you want Kirsten out of here or not ? Because this gamble 's all the gamble I got . Hey . Tell me . He died . Two ... two days ago . The funeral was yesterday . I wasn 't even there . How 's your mom ? She 's holding up . Did you tell her ... why you haven 't been able to call ? I wanted to , but she stopped me . She said it doesn 't matter . Whatever I was doing was important , and that my father would have approved . I loved him so much . I know . Come on . Okay . Stations , everyone . Technically , this Stitch is still active , so there 's no go-no-go to call . Linus and Camille , I 'll need you both to isolate the memory . Linus , you okay ? He 's good . Okay . Let 's go get our girl . Isolate the signal and route it to my station in three , two , one . - Mark ! - Done . Got it . Kirsten ? - Kirsten ? - Mom . Hi , honey . I think it 's ... time for you to go now . I 'm not leaving . This is no place for you . If you ... stay here , you will die . I don 't care . I want to be with you forever . Entanglement is holding . Say it . Well , I don 't want to be with you . You don 't mean that . Yes , I do . Now , leave . Heart rate 's up to 103 . Entanglement is weakening . Is there any way you can diminish everything except the mother memory ? Give me ten seconds . Mom ? You don 't mean that . What have you ever done for me ? Entanglement is down to 50 percent . I am cutting background impulses now ! I tried to save you . Save me ? Save me ? You 're the reason my life is the way it is . Mom . Please , what are you saying ? Heart rate : 137 . - Really push her . - What do you think I 'm doing ? Push her harder . Here , take this . I was happy before you came into my life ... do you know that ? I had my work , my life ... and then you ruined everything ! That 's not true . You don 't feel that way . You can 't feel that way ! Twenty-three percent . I do , Kirsten . That 's exactly how I feel . Please , Mom , don 't say that . It 's the truth . No , you love me ! I know you do . You 're wrong . But I love you . I don 't care . Now leave me alone ! - Mom , please . - Nine percent . I don 't want to be with you . - Leave ! - No ! - Leave ! - Mom ! - Go , damn it ! - Mom ! Kirsten . You can 't help me if you 're stuck in here . Mom ? Get out of my life ! - Mom ! - I don 't love you ! - Mom ! - Zero percent . We 're disentangled . Mom ! Mom ! Kirsten . Kirsten . Shh . It 's okay . That wasn 't her . No . She said things . No , no . No , that ... that wasn 't her , okay ? That was me . I said those things . That ... What ? That was you ? Talking through my mother the whole time ? It was the only way to get you to bounce . Kirsten . Arrest them all . What ? Hey ! Slow down . How long ? You asleep ? Closin ' in on 18 hours . - Cameron . - He saved you . Why are you here ? I ... I thought you hated me . Yeah . Uh ... about that . I was just mad at you , but ... feels like a pretty long time ago . Where is Cameron ? Where 's Camille ? You know the unctuous guy ? At the NSA , the one who looks like a sci-fi villain ? - Blair . - He arrested everyone . So , you know about the Stitchers technology . Yes , and I know my father . Our father helped build it . He trapped me inside my own memory . He 's not my father , not anymore . So where did Blair take everyone ? I don 't know . When you bounced , they ushered me out of the interrogation room . How many guards are sitting outside right now ? None . Blair said you weren 't going anywhere . Well , he 's wrong . Well , the unsinkable Miss Clark . Thought you 'd have bodyguards to protect you against rogue agents . - Budget cuts . - Mmm . I am surprised to see you back on your feet so quickly , Miss Clark . My sister helped me . Ah ! The sister you 're a fool for trusting . - That sister ? - Where 's my team ? Your small , erratic team of warrior-scientist friends are being detained . - Pending relocation . - Relocation ? What 's that code for ? Execution ? Don 't be a child , Miss Clark . Now , please , if you 'll excuse me , I need to prepare for my meeting with Admiral Decker . He 's my boss . Everyone answers to a higher authority , Miss Clark . What about my team ? I am preparing a new , more trustworthy team for you , so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue . No , it won 't , not without me . Seriously ? This again ? All right . All right . Come with me . I would 've thought you 'd be ready for a change in your team , considering how Goodkin used your mother 's memory against you . Well , it worked , didn 't it ? It got me to bounce . Well , but at what cost ? Hmm ? How will you remember your mother now ? How will you react to her when you are reunited ? Yeah . Reunited . - You know where she is . - I do . Someplace safe . - I want the truth . - That is the truth . Trust me , the NSA needs her hale and hearty as badly as you do . Please . The lab accident that happened to your mother , the one when you were eight years old , do you have any idea what she was working on ? - Project Grasshopper . - Yeah , that 's the name . But its purpose ? No ? Well , Project Grasshopper 's goal was to accelerate the evolution of the human brain . You can 't speed up evolution . Yes , you can . Why would anyone want to ? Well , imagine if world leaders knew instantly what other world leaders felt and thought ? If they could immediately intuit the wants , needs , fears , desires of their counterparts . You tell me . What would that mean ? - The end of conflict ? - Yes . The end of war . Hunger , poverty , pretty much all the bad stuff that keeps nice people , like me , up at night . Project Grasshopper was a failure . Ah ! That depends on who you ask . The lab accident accelerated your mother 's brain . She evolved in ways more complex than we understand . We tried to recreate it , and we failed , and that is why we need to keep your mother safe . So that after Stitching technology is perfected , we can Stitch into her living , evolved brain and map it completely , every neuron , until we understand her completely . We 're saving the world , Miss Clark . - Our cases are training missions ? - Yes ! Designed to teach us everything there is to know about Stitching . And when we are done ... when we are done ... you get to complete the rescue mission you started with your father all those years ago and finally pull your mother out of her endless sleep . Oh , suddenly , I 'm not such a bad guy , am I ? Your mother 's alive and well . One day , you 'll be reunited with her , but not if you quit the program . - I can 't do it without my team ! - Yes , you can ! They 're very , very smart people , sure , but they are just people . You will stay with the program if you want to save your mother , Miss Clark . You sure it 's okay for me to be here ? I stopped caring what 's okay about an hour ago . Who 's there ? Jesus . Tim ! - Who 's the skirt ? - Who 's the ape ? That 's Tim . He works here in Engineering . God , what happened to your hair ? I cut it . I figured I 'm going to prison , why wait ? Why aren 't you detained ? I am . I need to 3D print some spare parts for the new team before I get shipped off . I hope it 's some place nice like Cleveland . Mmm . Are you sure Blair has no idea Linus has it ? Positive . If Linus is half as smart as I think he is , he found a way to keep it on him . Question . What are we talking about ? There it is . I lent Linus my smart-watch . He still has it . This is gonna be harder than I wanted . That 's an NSA facility . Biometrics , photo ID . - It 's impossible . - Kirsten : Mmm . Well , that 's what people say about hacking into the memories of the dead . No , that sounds reasonable . You know how I 'm gonna get them out of there ? Through the front door . Kirsten : Nora Dublin , 42 years old . Highest ranking woman in the NSA security hierarchy . Got the promotion from the President himself . Holds the rank of Security Commander . Currently stationed in Cairo . You look good for 42 . It 's clean living . What about the biometrics ? You don 't happen to have Nora Dublin 's fingers lying around , do you ? I 'm about to . I hope this will fool the biometrics scanner . I 've never printed anything this thin and flexible . I have no idea how long it will last . Hopefully long enough . - Good evening . - Ma 'am . Commander Dublin . From the Cairo office ? - Yes . - What brings you to LA ? I 'm here to oversee a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23 . We don 't have detention blocks . Well , in Cairo , that 's what we call where the prisoners are held . If you call it something different here , that 's your business , not mine . It 's good . - Thank you . - Hold it , Commander . I need to call this in because that 's my business . Woman : Director Mitchell Blair 's office . Guard : Yes , this is Post 1477E16 . Calling in for confirmation of a prisoner transfer . Stand by for Director Blair . This is Blair . Yes , I 'm at Post 1477E16 . Is this about the prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23 ? - Yes , sir . - I concur . - Concur ? - Approve ? She 's good . Good to go . It 's all good . Tell Commander Dublin , I say hello . Will do , sir . Sorry to bother you . Sorry for the delay , Commander . - Director Blair sends his regards . - That 's so Director Blair . Guard : Place your right hand on the scanner , please . Commander , may I see your credentials one more time ? When was the last time you had this scanner cleaned ? Hmm ? Ma 'am ? In Cairo , we clean our scanners daily . - Commander , let me escort you . - That would be lovely . Here we are , the , uh ... detention blocks . Thank you . - I 'll take it from here . - Are you sure ? These prisoners attacked a fully-armed NSA unit . I can take care of myself . - I 'll wait outside . Just in case . - Mm-hmm . You got to be freakin kidding me ! Well , look who finally showed up . Camille : Told you ! Kirsten , what the hell are you doing here ? Getting you out ? Please tell me you 're not cooking . Yeah , crepes . You want ? I thought you guys were in trouble . It 's like a country club ! We 're being reassigned , not water-boarded . Okay , well , Blair plans to continue with the program . I told him I wouldn 't do it without you . Let me guess . He didn 't care ? He ... he said my mother 's still alive , and that as soon as we perfect Stitching , I 'll be able to save her . - He told you all of that ? - That sounds a little crazy . At least he didn 't screw with my memory of her . I will explain it when we 're outta here . All right , so what 's the plan ? Something that doesn 't involve us getting shot on the way out ? No , I worked up a security clearance , told the guards I 'm taking charge of you . It 's a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23 . - Mmm ! That 's my girl ! - Blade Runner ? - Star Wars . - Darn . We 're gonna walk out of here together , then we 're gonna find my mother , and we 're gonna use that knowledge as leverage . Force Blair to let you all continue with the program . NSA protocol is that prisoner transfers require at least one armed guard . I don 't suppose you 're carrying a gun . You said we couldn 't . Your idea , not mine . Only one armed guard ? Done ! Ivy told me about your dad . Linus , I 'm so sorry . He was a good man . Yeah . He was the best . Thanks . Hey . - Can we talk about the Stitch ? - I 'd rather not . Look , I 'm sorry about what I did to get you to bounce , but ... It 's not that I 'm not grateful , it 's just now I 'm stuck remembering my mother that way . She wasn 't real . She was to me . Thank you for your cooperation . - Freeze ! Stay where you are ! - Right there ! Guess crepes are back on the menu . We 've had plenty of time to check . There 's no other way out . Well , maybe you missed something . Then again , maybe we didn 't . - You 'll be fine . - I 'm worried about everyone else . Well , we 'll be fine too . I 've always wanted to spend more time in an Arctic weather station . Joking . I ... I have no idea where Blair 's reassigning me . Why don 't you just quit ? - You could go back to research . - What ? ! And give up show business ? Nah . Maybe if I play nice , and don 't piss anyone off for a while , Blair will let me back in the Stitch lab , but ... Why would you even want to ? Because that 's where you 'll be . Okay , you need to keep Stitching . - Not without you . - Yes , without me ! It 's the only hope your mother has . Look , look , as long as I know you 're safe , I 'll be okay , and ... You know , I am ... I am sorry about what I did to your memory of her , but that 's why you need to keep Stitching , so you can save your mother and make some new memories . We 're needed back at the lab . Something 's happened . They showed up about a half hour ago . What is she doing here ? She helped me rescue you guys . Camille : So , this is what rescued looks like ? Oh , hi , Mitch . Great to see you again . Not now , Engelson . New case has come in . 27 years old . Hit and run ... while jogging downtown . His name is Nathan Blair . He 's my son . Mitchell , I am so sorry . I need to know who did this and if it was premeditated . Maybe someone killed Nathan to get to me . I need to know who . Mitchell , I don 't think that this is good for you . He was my son . Okay . No . Kirsten , come with me . We have him where we want him . Negotiate , get pardons . Make him tell us where my mother is . " We have him where we want him ? " Is that who you are ? Yeah , and I didn 't see him crying over the people I lost . Me neither . That man kept me from finding out that my father had died for three days . I didn 't even get to go to my own father 's funeral because of Blair . I 'm not doing jack for him . And that is why you two are better than he is . - I 'm not so sure about that . - I am . Go suit up . Hey ! Look , I don 't know how ready you are to Stitch so soon after ... you know , but first time something goes wrong , I want you to bounce , okay ? - Mm-hmm . - I almost lost you once . I 'm not doing that again . Hey . You 're cute when you 're worried about me . Then I must be cute all the time . Cameron : All right , lights at 20 percent , please . I need a go-no-go for Stitch Neuro-sync . - Life Sci ? - Go . - Sub-Bio ? - Go . - Cameron : Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go ! - Medical . - We are a go . Comm check . One , two , one , two . - I hear you , Cameron . - All right , mission clock set to five minutes , please . Okay , ladies and gentlemen , this one 's family . So , let 's get it right . Induce Stitch Neuro-sync on my mark . In three ... two ... one ... mark . Blair : " All that night , we were in a great bustle " getting things in their place ... - squire 's friends ... " - Cameron : What do you see , Kirsten ? Nathan 's seven years old , maybe , eight . Blair 's reading to him in the office . Treasure Island . Kirsten : Blair 's being very sweet to him . He loved that book . " The boatswain sounded his pipe ... " " and the crew began to man the capstan-bars . And the crew began to man the capstan-bars . " Located a memory hotspot . - How hot ? - Molten . All right , K , you 're on the move . You don 't even know her ! The NSA knows her family . She 's not her parents . Blair : We are all our parents . That 's who we become . Blair and Nathan are fighting . It 's about a girl . You think that she 's using me to get to you ? I can 't rule it out . Everything makes sense when I 'm with her , Dad . God , sentiment like that is proof you 're not ready to get married , not just to her , but to anyone . Do not turn your back on me , young man ! You 're wrong ! Not all of us become our parents . That 's the last memory Nathan had with Blair in it . That 's the last time I saw him alive . Approaching death memory . Kirsten , talk to me , Sunshine . Blair wants to kill your mother . Do not trust him . Find out where she is , and find a way to tell me . Together , we can save her . I 'm counting on you , sweetheart . - Oh my God . - Kirsten , what is it ? Cameron : Will you talk to me , damn it ? Cameron . You okay there ? Kirsten , bounce . And hey , I don 't think you 're a bad person for calling the NSA on me . Kirsten , Daddy loves you so much . Death memory in six seconds . Kirsten , damn it , make the bounce . Well ? What 'd you see ? Don 't play with me , Miss Clark . What 'd you see ? - Nothing . - What 'd you see ? ! Nothing . Sidearm . Now . Blair ! Tell me , or I will shoot her . Kirsten , don 't tell this ass-hat anything . Blair , take it easy . I would stop moving , right now , Detective , if I were you . Mitchell , I know you 're upset , but you don 't have to do this . What did you see ? I saw my father kill your son . What ? He knew you 'd make us Stitch , so he wanted to give me a warning . He said you 're gonna kill my mother . Why would I kill your mother ? You tell me . That son of a bitch ... killed my son to tell you that . I 'm gonna find your psychopathic father , and when I do , I am gonna kill him . That 's my warning . Touch me again , and I 'll rip out your ribcage and wear it like a vest . There are several vans waiting outside . You 'll all be held for reassignment . All except you , Miss Clark . What makes you think I 'll keep working here after you take everyone away from me ? I haven 't taken everyone away from you . Not yet . He used me to make you stay , didn 't he ? You know , this lab ... it used to remind me of everything that was wrong in my life . And now it 's pretty much the only place where ... everything 's right . Kirsten ... - I 'm so sorry ... - It 's not your fault . And as long as my mom is out there somewhere , alive , I 'm not done . What about Blair ? I was the smartest person in the room . But Cameron , Camille , Linus , even Maggie and Fisher , they 're ... they 're all so much smarter than I am in so many ways . But ... there is one person that I 'm smarter than . Mitchell Blair . You got something on him in the Stitch , didn 't you ? Oh , yeah . Nora Dublin ? Credentials , please . You look younger than I remember , Miss Dublin . I apologize , Admiral . My name is Kirsten Clark , and I work for a secret division of the NSA that hacks into the memories of the dead . It 's called the Stitchers Program , but you knew that . - That 's ridiculous . - You know it 's not . Leave us . You lured me here by falsely claiming to be a high-ranking NSA Commander . I should have you arrested . I know ... but as Secretary of Defense , I thought you should know that someone is threatening to go public about the Stitchers Program , as well as your personal knowledge of the billions of dollars that have been diverted developing it . - Who ? - Me . Kirsten : You know Daniel Stinger , and you certainly know Mitchell Blair . That means you know about the Stitchers Program . Let 's just say for a moment you 're right . - Why are we here ? - To make a deal . My colleagues are being reassigned . I don 't want that to happen . Anything else ? I want Maggie Baptiste to run the Stitchers Program . I never want to see Mitchell Blair again . Is that it ? No . I 'm looking for someone . And I know you know where she is . Who are you looking for ? My mother . Well , I 'm not sure what you did . Not sure if I want to know either , but well done . All I can say is that it 's good to have friends in high places . Speaking of which , congratulations on your promotion . Well , just because I 've been offered Blair 's job doesn 't mean that I want it . Sure you do . May I come in ? Always . So ... Kirsten Clark saves the day again . - It was a team effort . - Well . Is Nina here ? Yeah , about that . This was waiting for me when I got home . " Cameron , I waited three days for you . " Every time I heard a noise in the hall , " I would go to the door thinking it was you coming home , " but it never was . " I love you , but I can 't wait for you anymore . Take care of yourself . Love , Nina . " Cameron ... I 'm so sorry . Are you okay ? Yeah . I mean , I love Nina , but I ... I wasn 't in love with her . Took me a while , but I think I finally figured that out .

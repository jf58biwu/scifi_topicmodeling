 I can 't believe this is happening . I cannot believe I let you do this . - We all agreed . - I didn 't . - We decided it was worth the risk . - This is a mistake . This is how amateurs get caught . Nomi , help . Will , it 's going to be fine . The ID held up . In England . Outgoing . It is never the same as Incoming . We 're inside the TSA , watching for any alert . Any better ? Unh-unh . You 're in the woods . You barely have Wi-Fi . - Bug 's on it . - Color the Bug totally clustered . Hi , Bug . What 's up , Neets ? Can I get you anything ? Earplugs . Okay . I heard that . And they 're not gonna work because I 'm talking inside your head . She knows . She didn 't mean it literally . And you know he 's only freaking out because he loves you so much . You can 't do anything now . Let 's let her sleep . Okay , dinner 's ready . Oh , we 're coming . Bug , anything happens , no matter how small , you call me . Bug 's on duty . You know , this whole visiting thing ? It 's a little like FaceTime without a phone . Ha ! That 's what I said ! Uh-oh . What ? Wait , what ? - TSA bumped up its warning level . - Why ? Another mass shooting . At this point , aren 't mass shootings just business as usual in America ? Please be careful . I will . Ma 'am ! He 's in a meeting . This is more important . ... less humid in those countries . Oh , my God . - Kala . - I 'm interrupting again . No , no , no , no . You 've just turned an unbearably boring piece of business into another rare pleasure . I will come back . Mrs. Rasal , the priority is obvious here . And Raj , I must say , you 're spending too much time with me when you have a bride this beautiful right here in the very same building . It makes me think I taught you nothing at school , my friend . One of us has to work , Ajay . See you later . - Mrs. Rasal . - Come , Kala . These shipping reports have been falsified . Everything . Everything that the controller is approving has been doctored . The manifests are complete lies ! My God , Kala , you are even more beautiful when you 're upset . Rajan , please . We 're shipping out old antibiotics , discontinued HIV inhibitors . We 're selling old , useless , defective , and possibly poisonous drugs to people whose lives depend on them . I know this is not easy to hear for the first time , but this is all standard procedure . We have to vacate our storage space . And our profit margins , like every pharma company , depend on not wasting every drug that 's slightly below standard . You know ? This is how this business works . We all do it . Some of those drugs can still work . We are selling the only kind that those people can afford . You have to trust me . This is the way to serve the greater good . What if your father or what if I went to a hospital and was given improper , expired drugs ? - That won 't happen . - Why not ? Because these products are shipped to distant places . We would never risk the lives of our own people . Which places ? Out of India . You know , like China or Africa , faraway places . Like Kenya ? Could be . Why ? Kala ? Have you seen this ? So many terrible things going on . I used to wonder if there was something I could do to try to change the world ... before I understood such thoughts were unskilled . Trying to change the world only leads to suffering . All we can change is ourselves . I 'm not sure I agree . I know . That 's why I can 't help you . You weren 't sitting in that seat before , were you ? I hope one day we can visit again ... when your thinking does not reflect their thinking . No , please , talk to me . You were at the rave . I don 't understand . Why can 't I see where you are ? You may feel gravity without knowing how it works . There are forces acting upon every life that remain beyond our control or comprehension . I think we can all agree that things were much different back then . Oh , so different . There were none of these mass shootings . Oh , God . Did you see the terrible news ? We just heard about it . They always want to blame it on a religion , an ethnic group , or a skin color , but the one thing no one ever wants to say ... - It 's always a man . - Some fucking dude not getting any . Violence has a gender . Oh , my God . I love your dads . I find it fascinating how every generation believes in different things . We believed in pot . And sex . We were Black Panthers . - Oh , bad motherfuckers . - Now we cook quinoa . Oh , come on now . You all were more interested in pussy than politics . And what was the nice Jewish girl from Santa Barbara interested in ? I wanted to end patriarchal control over women 's bodies . " Copulation for a better nation . " By having sex with every homie in Oakland . - By any means necessary . - Mom ! They exaggerate , honey . Oh , I just think it 's amazing that none of you ever cared that you didn 't know who her biological dad was . Well , what can you do when this thing smiles at you ? Oh , I know . We 're here , we 're queer ! Get used to it , get used to it ! We 're here , we 're queer ! Get used to it , get used to it ! Ha ! Ha ! That 's the most fun I 've had in my entire life . That 's what you told me once . Joaquin , what are you doing here ? I wanted nothing to do with you . Nothing . And I did my best to convince them that you were beyond saving . - They wanted to see it by themselves . - Ay , no . Dad , Mom ... what are you doing here ? You 're our daughter . We 've come to take you home . Daddy , I 'm happy here . I want to stay . Look what you 're doing to your mother , huh ? This ? This ... is what I was trying to explain . They changed her . They 've made me realize that I can 't be with an asshole - that uses my face as a punching bag . - Enough ! Joaquin ... get her bag . Huh ... Want to go again ... faggot ? Only if you want your ass kicked by a faggot . Again . Thank you . Stop it . I 'm not going anywhere with you . Don 't be a child , Daniela . Don 't treat me like one . Everything I built in this world , I built for you . But if you force me , I will cut you out of that world and I 'll never look back . I know this is hard for all three of you to understand , but I have a relationship with these two men that isn 't based on threats , or control , or money . You 're not allowed to be sanctimonious when you 're living off a trust fund . Keep your money . She doesn 't need it . Daniela , please ... come home with us . Sorry , Mom . I am home . I 'm home . Hey ! Whoo-hoo ! - Hi . - One sec . - Is it Will again ? - Yeah . Listen , I just want to know what the plan is in case the ID doesn 't work out . I 'm telling you , it 's the best one I 've ever done . And by the way , how do you know so much about fake IDs ? Every trans person needs a new ID . And when the government makes them too hard to get , I make it easy . She 's not through yet . It 'll be fine . I know you feel we can trust Hoy , but if I were BPO , I would be waiting for you here . If they know I 'm here , I don 't think it will be because of Hoy . Someone 's following me . Excuse me . Diego ! God , you 're a sight for sore eyes . So ... you 're the chick with the weird accent . I am . I didn 't think he was gonna come . I probably shouldn 't be here . Both Will and I are so grateful . He said he was gonna explain , oh , a few little things . Like why he just disappeared for over a fucking year without explaining shit to his best fucking friend . D , I 'm sorry . He 's very sorry . Yeah , sure . You know what ? I don 't know why I 'm complaining to you . Not like he can hear me , right ? Come on . Oh , my God . Really ? Makes sense . What does ? Coming here . You know Superdawg ? Whenever he gets nervous , he needs to eat . I gotta get something to eat . You want anything ? I 'm okay . I really miss the malts . Actually , I 'll try a malt . That 's what he always orders . Five , six , seven , eight ! Mama ? - Ah . Hello , my son . - Hi , Mom . - This is Zakia , the girl I was ... - Ah ! Yes , of course . It 's wonderful to finally meet you . It 's great to meet you , too . Capheus told me about the work that you do here with the kids . It is amazing . These children do far much more for us than we could ever do for them . So the school focuses on teaching kids different kinds of art ? Yes . Art is fundamental to the development of a child 's imagination . One cannot create or achieve anything unless they imagine it first . My son tells me that you were educated in London ? - Yes . - What a gift . It was . He said that you were offered many jobs but you decided to come back home . I know there 's a lot of work to do here . There 's too much injustice , too much corruption , too much poverty . But I love Kenya , like your son does . My future is my country . Which is why I am so excited about him running for office . What ? Uh ... Mama , I 've been meaning to tell you something . I used to sit here and think so much about the future ... trying to picture what my life would be like . I never imagined anything like this . I don 't think anyone knows what life they will live . - That 's what makes life feel alive . - Hm ... Do you think that is also true for people , and if it is , does that mean that you can never really know your own husband ? Or your own brother . I have to admit , I 'm very uncomfortable with this level of uncertainty . No , but what is the alternative ? Kala ? You have a visitor . We can stay with you . No , it 's all right . We need to talk . - Hm ? - Hm . So you got these different voices in your head , and one of them is Will ? I know it sounds strange . If he 's in your head listening , does that mean he can hear everything I 'm saying ? - Yeah . - Yes . So when I say , " Go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut , Gorski , " he can hear that ? Yeah . I deserve it . He says he deserves it . Damn right he does . Ask him why should I give a shit about him or his crazy-ass " I hear voices " girlfriend when he obviously doesn 't give a shit about me ? Your phone is about to ring . Huh ? Listen , D , I 'm sorry . You can 't just apologize for something like this , man . Will you please just let me try to explain , okay ? All I 'm asking for is two minutes . I don 't have two minutes for you . Okay . All right , that 's fine . Will you just answer me one question ? What ? How many times did the Feds or Homeland Security call you in for questioning ? I don 't think I can count that high , man . Well , you didn 't tell them anything because you didn 't know anything . And that is why I couldn 't call , because I know you , D. I know how much you love being a cop . And a big part of why I love being a cop is being in that hot stinky car every day with my best friend . I also know my best friend is the shittiest liar I 've ever met . If you lost your job lying to protect me , you couldn 't be a cop anymore . I ... I couldn 't forgive myself for that . Part of being a best friend , man , is caring more about them than you care about a damn job . Yeah , but you got a wife . You got two beautiful kids . Yeah , and they fucking miss you , too . I miss them . I miss you . I miss my life . I 'm trying to get it back . But I need your help . Okay . All right . What do you want me to do ? You were right . I don 't say this as an excuse , but only in trying to understand it myself . I have been working in this company since I was a child . I packed boxes when other kids were playing football . As soon as I understood math , my father taught me how to crunch margins . I was raised to believe in this company the way other people believe in God . The more devout I was , the more I sacrificed , the more I expanded my faith , then the more my god would protect me and my family . Nothing has been more important . And this focus has caused me to lose sight of ... things that a man in my position should never lose sight of . But I 've changed everything now . This company is going to do things differently from now on . Kala , the look in your eyes made me see what you saw . And I hated it , too . You are my life . Everything else is ... belongings . And more than anything ... I want to be the man you believed me to be . No , no , no ! I forbid it ! Mama , I thought we were discussing it . There 's nothing to discuss . Politics turns people into fools and fools into thugs . Politics killed your father and it 's going to kill you . - I understand how you feel . - Then why are we discussing it ? I don 't know . Maybe I 've been looking around and seeing things that are wrong ... and wondering if there is anything I can do to help fix them . Maybe I have too much of my father in me . Maybe I 'm just as foolish as he was . We had the very same argument . Just tell me why . I already said I will tell them no . But you want to tell them yes . I do . Tell me why , when you know it 's so dangerous . Because we cannot escape hope . The only hope we have of making this country a better place is if we do it ourselves . I 'm sorry . The last thing I want to do is cause you pain . I will tell them I have to withdraw . You will do no such thing . All I ask is that you remember that you are all I have left of him . Father , I 'm sorry . If you hadn 't come to the prison ... if you hadn 't cared about me ... maybe you would still be alive . I feel lost . Everything I considered my home ... is gone . Every time I begin to feel I belong somewhere ... I have to leave . I 'm trapped between what I want and what I know I can 't have . Mom ... I miss you . I measure so much of my life against one afternoon with you . I 'm sorry , Mama . I lost the match . You fought someone almost twice your age . But I lost and made you sad . I 'm not sad , Sun . Then why are you crying ? Mothers worry for their daughters . I 'm always afraid for you when I come to these matches . But I 'm not afraid . I know . That 's why I 'm crying . Your teacher told me he 's never seen a fighter as fearless as my daughter . When I watch you and I see your fierce determination ... I know that your life will not be like mine ... and that makes me very , very happy . That was the day you took me to the Spring Festival . There is much of her in you . I was nourished by her . But Joong-Ki was too young . It was my duty to raise him in her place . But I failed . What happened was not your fault . A lot of people never get the kind of love you got from your mother . I certainly didn 't . But it didn 't turn me into a murderer . That may be true . But it doesn 't change the feeling inside of me . I know feelings and emotions can overwhelm our logic , and at the same time , logic can ruin the emotions that make life worth living . My brother killed my father because of me . This is not a feeling . It is a fact . For many years after my father was killed ... I believed it was my duty to avenge him . I stole a gun . I imagined myself shooting the men who killed him many times . But you never did . No . Why ? My mother . Come . Sit with me . I want to talk to you about your father . I asked her if she hated the men who killed him ... - and she said ... - I have no room in my heart for hate . I don 't have a mother to give such advice . Maybe not . But you have us . Are you going to tell me ... I should trust in the law ? No . My father was like your brother . The world is better off without them . I think I 'm more confused than I was before . There 's no easy answer , Sun . Whatever you decide to do ... just know you won 't have to do it alone . I don 't care where she is . Mr. Rodriguez , hi . - You cut your hair ! - Excuse me . You don 't have an appointment with him . Sir ! Did you see it ? Listen , I gotta call you back . Did you watch it ? - Oh , yeah , I watched it . - It has almost two million hits ! Oh , can you believe it ? - It is incredible . - Lito , this is a bit awkward . I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you . I know . He said that I needed to talk to you . Oh , he did , did he ? Okay . Let 's do this . Before you start , I know I 've been having trouble finding the right project . - It 's not that . - I really think I needed to do this before I was ready . Well , I wish you would have talked to us first . Why ? Look , I 'm not gonna coddle you . This agency no longer represents you . - What ? - Look , it has nothing to do with me . I mean , I even fought for you . You know , I think that what you 're doing is very , you know ... It 's important . - What are you talking about ? - There are certain high-level clients here at CMA who just , you know , they just simply don 't agree with your , um ... I don 't know , what do you want to call it ? Your lifestyle ? - It 's not a lifestyle . - Whatever . Look , they told management in no uncertain terms that it was either them or you . Okay ? Who ? Look , obviously this conversation never took place , okay ? I mean , we just decided to part ways , and , you know , wish each other the best , and , uh , explore other opportunities , et cetera . Blah , blah , blah . You said I was your guy . Well , you lied to us , too . Thank you . Can I offer an opinion ? I came alone . I just want to talk . That 's all . How did you know I would be here today ? Well , I didn 't . I 've been here every morning before my shift . I guessed if you did come , it would be early . I knew it 'd be important for you to visit them . I 'd have felt the same way if my father committed suicide . My father did not commit suicide . He was murdered . That is a strong allegation , Ms. Bak . It 's not an allegation , it is a fact , Detective . Do you then have evidence to prove it ? I know what my brother has done . And I do not require you or the law to believe me . Yeah ? Why ? Because I have seen your legal system from inside and out . And the last thing I would expect from it is justice . Look , Ms. Bak ... I meant what I said to your teacher , okay ? I 'm on your side . We know that your brother is not the man the media believes him to be . We suspect a lot of illegal money is flowing through his company . We 're just not able to prove it yet . Listen to yourself , Detective . Is this the system you serve ? Yeah . The law is imperfect . I 'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you . I don 't need anyone 's protection . Are you sure about that ? I promised I only wanted to talk , so I 'm not gonna stop you if you prefer to leave . But ... this today , may be my last chance for a rematch . May I propose a test to your invulnerability , Ms. Bak ? A quick spar . If you win , you leave as you wish . But if I win ... you come with me and tell your story on the record . If you 're not going to stop me , I have no need to fight you . No , you don 't need to . But I am hoping you want to . I have thought about our fight at Mrs. Cho 's apartment . A lot . I haven 't thought about it at all . All right . Show me what you 've learned , Detective . When was the last time you lost a fight , Ms. Bak ? I can 't remember . I remember that move from your fight with King Kong Kim . He was the best fighter from our dojo and you just cut him down like you were chopping a tree . Like that ? Exactly like that . Had enough ? No , Ms. Bak . Oh , no . You 're thinking too much , Detective . My teacher says the same thing . After I lost an important match , he told me that I worry too much about what I should or shouldn 't do . He says fighting is not something you do with your head , it 's something you do with your heart . You agree with him , Ms. Bak ? I think you will profit by spending more time with your teacher and less time pestering me . But this is much more fun . Come on . Let 's go . I think I know why you never remember your fights . You 're not fighting a person . You 're fighting something else . You used a false identity to fight because of your father . I think he refused to see you ... to understand how special you are . Ah ! You have improved , Detective . It was almost a year ago you kissed me right here . Riley , I , uh ... I , uh ... I know I 've been acting ... crazy lately . I don 't mean to be . - I know . - It 's just ... I 've never loved anyone , anyone ... the way that I love you . I promise I will come back to you . It 's the waiting that 's the hard part . - I know . - It 's , uh ... Do you think it 's gonna be much longer ? No . It could be tomorrow ... it could be next week . Or it could be right now . Which it so happens it is . He 's here ? The Archipelago has spoken . I 've been given an address . You must go there . You must go now . - Oh ! What ? Whispers . Where ? - Oh ! Sorry . Sorry . So sorry . But you are gonna freak out , too . - What ? - I couldn 't sleep . I was curious about the shooting everyone 's been talking about . - Oh , yeah ? - Mm-hm . And one of the people killed was this British politician , Mitchell Taylor . He was giving a speech when it happened . This is not out of some woolly desire to sit in a circle and sing Lennon 's " Imagine . " This is to remind people that free societies ... are stronger societies . - Is he speaking at a mosque ? - Uh-huh . Is he Muslim ? No . It was some kind of peace congregation with all kinds of people , Jews , Muslims , Christians , Atheists . Since the invention of cities , open , multicultural societies are the places that the world 's best and brightest have wanted to go to , while mono-cultural , repressive societies are the places they 've wanted to escape from . Oh , my God . Oh , those poor people . It 's horrible . What happened to the killer ? He tries to shoot himself . How much better would the world be if these guys would just start with themselves ? Right ? But look , just before he shoots . Good . They caught him . Yeah . But the whole thing seemed so sad . I mean , this guy Taylor trying to do something about our fear of otherness , then I got drawn in . I started reading all of his tweets , and posts , and interviews , and I was thinking how the Internet is a kind of psycellium , like what you experienced in the woods with Angelica , where memories and moments of our lives exist beyond us ... when I saw this ... Ruth El-Saadawi ? Freaky enough ? Then I started thinking like you 're thinking , maybe a coincidence is not a coincidence , when my phone pinged and I screamed . They put the killer in jail , but they didn 't release his identity until now . Todd . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , no . Of course . You gotta be shitting me . Come on . Riley . Okay , I 'm officially creeped out . I don 't like this , Riles . We 'll find another way to get to Whispers . Will ! Riley ! I know why Whispers has been missing . He 's been trapped in prison . He Bolgered Todd and used him to murder a politician named Mitchell Taylor . Holy shit . The church ? Why ? This is where the meeting is supposed to be . Okay , this is getting weirder and weirder . Riley ? Oh , my God . - He said I had to go down the stairs . - Who did ? Mr. Hoy . If you want my professional police opinion , I say there 's no way in hell I 'd go down there . Yes , thank you . Especially because if this was a movie , this would be the scene where the funny but annoying sidekick gets whacked . He said I have to go alone . Well , that solves my problem . - I 'll be in the car . - D ! Will , BPO doesn 't work like this . This is someone who 's very frightened . And if I was gonna do what they 're about to do , then I 'd be scared , too . I did a scene like this in Forgive Us Our Trespasses . What happened ? Everyone died . Not helpful . No . It is a test . They need to know that I 'm alone . No . Five minutes . In five minutes , I send in Diego . I needed to know how far you would go . I needed to know if I could trust you . I understand . It 's strange to finally meet . In a way , you and your cluster exist because of me . You work with Professor Kolovi . You helped Angelica escape . We both realized she was going to birth another cluster . After what happened to her first ... I knew she would die before she let that happen again . Why here ? Angelica heard me singing one day and asked where I 'd learned . And I told her about this church . It was her idea to come here . Why did Angelica work with BPO ? She was searching for her children . What happened to them ? None of us fully realized how fast BPO was changing . When I first started , it was very , very different . Dr. El-Saadawi was a visionary . I met her at Stanford . And the work I did with her felt like something ... sacred . When she died , I hoped Professor Kolovi would continue what she began . I don 't know . Maybe he believed in her work once , but ... not now . Not since he met Dr. Milton Bailey Brandt . That 's the first name I knew him by . When he came to the university , he had research , data on the development of the sensorium frontal lobe that we were all desperate for . Of course , we all suspected how he came about this information , but nobody wanted to ask . But still , Brandt never would have solved the problems of the neural graft without Angelica . Neural graft ? It 's mimics the connection of a cluster , overriding the consciousness of one sensorium onto another . Why ? I 'm an academic . Even when I heard you coming down the stairs , I wasn 't sure I would be able to go through with this . But I know what happened in New York . When I watched those poor , innocent people killed ... If it 's within our power to keep something that terrible from happening ... shouldn 't we ? Do you know what Angelica called Brandt ? Whispers . She told me , the voice in your head that tells you to cut your wrists , or to take a handful of pills , or to jump from a height ... that voice never shouts . It only whispers . Thank you . He sleeps on blockers . I couldn 't reach him a few hours ago . So you don 't know for certain if he 's in there ? No . Every moment we stand here , he could wake . She 's right . This is it . Are you really ready to kill a man in cold blood ? Jonas ? Hello , Will .

 INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION MARS PILGRIM 7 MISSION DAY 1 This is Dr Miranda North , Quarantine officer aboard the International Space Station . Today the Pilgrim capsule with it 's valuable Mars soil samples completes it 's 8 month return from Mars . Preparing to receive these samples has been the purpose of our mission these last few months . But the Pilgrim capsule is damaged . At 06 : 30 UTC Pilgrim was struck by debris and veered off course . Rory Adams will space walk to establish visual contact with the incoming space capsule and he will grab it with the remote arm . We 've been waiting a long time for this sample and Rory is placing himself at great risk to secure it . - Over and out . - EMU report : 4.7 psi , pure O2 . So how you gonna do it ? I wouldn 't do it that way . - Dr Jordan . - Faster , faster , faster ... Nitrogen is zero . - Dr North ? I 'm in the airlock . - Faster , faster .. come on . - Rory , slow to go fast . - Or fast to go fast . - Deliberate . - We 're here to get fast . Remember , 8 billion people . Rory , if you can 't save it ... Yeah , spoiler alert ! I 'm fucking saving it ! But if you can 't , just push the capsule into deep space , ok ? Do you hear me ? Can you get OCD , sorry , CDC , out of my face ? 'Cause if I got a big operation , I need to concentrate . - I just want you ... - I can 't , I can 't hear you ... - I love you too . - At all . - EMU at 4.7 psi , pure O2 . - Where is the remote ? - Here . The arm is yours , full manual . - All right , here we go . - Careful with .. sorry , you know this . - Yeah , I got it . - No more sorries . - Miranda , to the cupola , please . Yep . - David , are you on your way ? - On my way . - Slow , Sho . - Excuse me . How you say " breath " in Japanese ? This was supposed to be a routine . The air lock is sealed . I .. am .. walking . 04 : 35 UTC . After striking debris , Pilgrim non-responsive . Inbound on a collision course with the ISS . Initiate emergency course correction and manual retrieval . Cannon armed online . Transferring control to wireless . Station to Control . Initiating sequence . Affirmative . - So , the committee ? - You let me worry about the committee . Where 's Rory ? - He is at risk out there . - Easy folks , mics are live . - Ready , Sho ? - Thrusters up . Holding in position . I have control of the arm . Your worry lines are showing . Yeah , well , I get paid by the line . - I have a good feeling about this . - Yeah ? - Rory is gonna deliver that sample . - Right to your lab . Prepare for course correction . .0509 .076 - Remember your training . - We never trained for this ! On my mark ! 5 4 3 2 1 - New capsule trajectory , negative 0.50 . - Proximity alert . Proximity alert . Ignore the proximity alert . New station trajectory : negative 0.32 . The capsule will miss us , just . - Rory ? - I still don 't reach . It 's coming in shallow . Any moment now . 8 , maybe 9 clock . I 'm having fun . You guys having fun ? Rory .. - if you miss ... - Yeah , yeah , yeah . If ... Just gonna skip off the atmosphere , like a flat stone on water . Just fly off into nowhere , no harm done . Okay . There ! - There . - I see it . All right . Here we go , here we go ... This is fun . - Rory , you have to move , it 's gonna hit you . - That 's bad . Please Rory , move . Station to Control . Visual confirmation of Mars Capsule Pilgrim . I used to play catcher , but only in T-ball . - Rory ? - Not now . Not now . Come here , come here , come on , come on ... Rory ? - Rory ? - Rory ? He caught it ! Hugh ... Cue Instagram ! I didn 't wanna jinx it . - Point and shoot , motherfucker ! - Okay . Mars Capsule in lock position . I 'm coming home . This is mission commander , Ekaterina Golovkina . Tell the committee , Pilgrim 's landed on Plymouth rock . The Mars samples are safe and sound . Copy that , Commander . Congratulations . ISS , DAY 2 Ready ? We are recording . 06 : 40 UTC . Pilgrim wasn 't just seeing things in the Mars soil . We are looking at a large single cell . Inert . Unmistakably biological . And like organisms on Earth , it has what appears to be a nucleus ... cytoplasm . The cell wall is thick . Those hairs look like cilia . Longer than we 're used to seeing on Earth . More like flagella . - What 's the temperature ? - Minus 110 . Start bringing it up . Minus 82 . Even quicker . Minus 55 . This is some Re-Animator shit . Oh , that 's a very obscure reference . - Not for a nerd . - Not if you 're a nerd . Minus 17 . - Zero degrees . - Oh , come on ... 18 19 20 degrees Celsius . Nothing . Update ? I 'm gonna try a different atmosphere . Closer to Proterozoic Earth than today 's Mars . Less oxygen more carbon dioxide . And then , when Sho is ready , a growth medium . In this case , glucose . Come on , dance . Did it just move ? Hugh ? My God . It worked . You woke it . We are looking at the first incontrovertible proof of life beyond Earth . Oh , it 's beautiful . Our first question is from Allen . He is 9 years old . And Allen , what is your question for Commander Golovkina ? Is it green ? It 's not visible at all actually , it 's microscopic . A single cell . To put it into perspective , your body is made up of trillions . There is an alien inside of me ? Oh , I bet your teacher sometimes thinks so . Well , we have another question from 8 year old Marrie . Are you bringing the alien back to Earth ? No , we are gonna keep it up here . We 're gonna study it where it 's safe . Commander ? The ISS is the most expensive house ever built . 200 billion American dollars and counting because we keep adding rooms . It flies around Earth 16 times a day . In 30 years , over one hundred people have lived here thanks to generous countries like Russia , the USA and China . We call this Tranquility node . Dr Jordan here is about to break the record for consecutive days on space . 473 straight . Your mommy must miss you . She does , but I have family here . Yeah , the kind that teases him 'cause his mommy misses him . This is one of our newest crew members , Miranda North From the Centers for Disease Control . She is a doctor too . You guys are witnessing a space triathlon . Yeah , I 'm winning . We have another question from 7 year old Layla . We think this question is a little personal . - Go ahead . - How do you go to the bathroom ? Funnel . Tube . And some suction . Everything we do on the ISS is like everything you do on Earth . - Except different . You like peas ? - Yeah . Mmh .. boom ! So , have you got a name yet ? For that we wanna go down live , just outside our studio in Time Square to one very brave class mate . - Hi , Dominique . - Hi . Calvin Coolidge Elementary was chosen among 11.000 schools for this honor . We name the Martian after our school . " Calvin " Control ? Control ? If you 're listening , and you probably are 'cause you 're creepy that way Can I just rant for a second about the micromanagement ? We are not blood filled new puppets . I come from a long line of plumbers . I can fix a shower . If I can 't , well , Hugh doesn 't shower anyway . He 's British . - First international incident . - Oh , I think , better cool you . You 're just a very underpaid nation , everybody knows it . - Don 't be an ugly American . - Wow , who 's ugly now ? I nailed Step 17 . I am a very good looking American , you know . Oh , I see , it 's right there . - Control , I 'm sorry about him . - Control can 't hear you . I don 't know where rage like that comes from . Can you please just fix the shower ? You know , I can ... I can do this myself . No , I know . You just haven 't . Doctors are always so bad at looking after themselves , aren 't they ? You 've spent too much time up here , David . Your atrophy has accelerated . And you 're close to radiation limit . You noticed any ... glowing in the dark ? I like it up here . When I was in the military , we go to Syria . You know We set up a hospital Treat all the casualties , and then We come back ... a week or two later , and the whole village would just be bombed out . That Earth isn 't all Syria though , is it ? Can 't stand what we do to each other down there . But it 's home , and it 's beautiful . Don 't you miss anything ? Don 't you miss fresh water , or birds the trees ? I like the hum up here . And the air . What you 've achieved with Calvin is remarkable , Hugh . I haven 't had a chance to say that . Thank you . I think these will prove to be greatest days of my life . I wish I had a time machine , so I could visit the 10 year old me . Did he want to be an astronaut ? He wanted out of the wheelchair . And how does he feel now ? Like a bird . Oh , don 't get me wrong . I don 't hate the chair . I love it . For the sake of the anonymous genius who invented it . You 're one of a kind , Hugh . Goodnight . ISS , DAY 12 - 11 : 20 UTC . - Hold on to your helmets . The glucose intake is very rapid . The specimen 's cells have began to move together on mass , as a unit . And they 've also shown electrical activity in what resembles a growing neural network . Notice I didn 't say " brain " . Dr North speaking . It 's our educated opinion that this new species is not a colony of fast dividing single celled organisms but one larger solitary organism composed of trillions of identical cooperative cells . Here 's what 's fascinating ... I mean , it 's all fascinating , isn 't it ? Unlike most multi-cellular organisms every cell of Calvin 's can perform every somatic function on its own . Every single cell is simultaneously a muscle cell and a nerve cell , and a photo-receptive cell . So the creature as a whole is , in a very real sense , all muscle all brain , all eye . As such , Calvin now possesses the means to interact with his environment including the use of what appears to be proto-appendages . I 'll demonstrate . I notice how it 's approaching and not retreating . Its curiosity outweighs its fear . This is beautiful . Hello , Calvin . How does that feel , Hugh ? You 're gonna be a daddy . It 's gonna be a big custody battle over this one . " And that there was more of it during the night . We can observe too how the recollection of a dream , which was still lively in the morning will melt away , except for a few small fragments . " This book doesn 't have pictures in it , does it ? Obviously not . Would you prefer that I don 't read it out loud ? I don 't know , but Guys , guys . Meet Mei . - Hi Mei ! - Hey Mei ! - Say hi to everybody , Mei . - Hi Mei ! - She 's beautiful ! - Congratulations ! - Thank you . " Nice to meet you " . - Do you have any idea who the father is ? - Shut up . - Another one , another one . Ok . For story time . It was my favorite . You might say , my first foray into space . - Thank you so much . - Thank you , Commander . - Thank you guys . - She 's beautiful , Sho . Thank you ! But seriously , that kid had blue eyes . ISS , DAY 25 Fuck ! It 's the lab . Ok . - Miranda , check the O2 in the lab . - O2 is on 21 . We 're clear for contamination . We 're okay . Calvin is safe . I don 't understand how this happened . Nothing in that lab can malfunction . The clamp . It failed . It 's on me . Yeah , no shit it 's on you . A dizzy 5 year old could 've spotted that . Protecting these firewalls , yes , that 's my job . But I can 't do it alone . Kibo wasn 't designed for strict firewall lockdown and neither was the station . There is zero precedent for any of this . But you do not come out of that lab without triple checking everything . You don 't go in that lab without a proper rest . For all I know , we 're carrying Anthrax on board . You can 't compare Calvin to Anthrax . Yeah , I know at least five guys back home who could do my job . Nobody can do yours except you . I don 't want to be around that thing . I am not qualified to be around that thing . I understand . I 'm just saying you can 't compare Calvin to Anthrax . Stop , stop calling it fukin ' Calvin ! You don 't know what that thing is . Yeah ? You 're in here and you 're playing around like it 's your buddy . I 'm your buddy . You 're drunk on this . Wake up ! This isn 't and will never be a controlled experiment . So let 's all agree we made our first and last mistake . I miss my fucking dog ! Goodnight . Dr Miranda North , quarantine officer , 23 : 20 UTC . After weeks of stunning growth and activity , Calvin is completely inactive . We believe it 's likely due to the clamp failure in the lab which caused a temporary change of air pressure in Calvin 's box . Our working theory is that this hibernation may be a defense mechanism . Everyone here is on edge . And Hugh of course has been beating himself up , but honestly I 'm relieved . Calvin was growing very fast and this is now giving me time to reinforce firewall precautions with the crew . The box must stay sealed . The lab must stay sealed . No matter the risk to Calvin . It 's just floating . Because of my mistake , in the lab . And it was going so well . What ? It 's something my dad used to say . " It was all going so well . " I 'm toying with the idea of stimulating it electrically . What you think ? - That 's not my call . - But if it were ? I don 't know . My job is lines of defense . Imagine the worst thing that could have happened and then the worse after that , and the worse after that , and then I I planned for all of them . I understand that . But risks are taken for reasons . Because of Calvin , we could have learned so much about life . Its origin , its nature , maybe even its meaning . - Oh no , I know . - You 're a doctor . Stem cell research . What if Calvin can make stem cells obsolete ? Help cure the incurable ? Reverse the irreversible ? I have to fix this . Good . You ready ? - Stretch . - Okay . And .. relax . Ready . - You sure it won 't hurt it ? - It 's a very very low voltage . We 're only stimulating it . - What exactly are you hoping for ? - I 'm hoping to wake him up . We 'll see under what conditions it reengages with its environment . Come on in . We 're shocking the monkey . Trying another spot . Nothing . Not even at the cellular level . Are you sure it 's not , uh ... dead ? It 's alive , it 's just in a deep sleep . Oh , Come on , Calvin . Wake up . Shit ! - What 's wrong ? - It broke the wand . I 'm gonna try and pull my hand out . Look , do that but just make sure to protect the glove . Shit . It 's gripping the glass . Okay , okay . Little son of a ... - How hard is he holding on to you ? - Like a firm handshake . - It 's funny . - It doesn 't hurt , but it 's damn strong . - What 's the problem ? - He 's got Hugh 's hand . His heart rate is at 165 . - Sho . Can we trust the glove ? - It 's very tight . Glove is not going anywhere . It 's fine . - Shit . - Okay but , just relax . Tell him to relax . Derry ? Derry ? Look at me . Look at me . Relax . Just relax your hand . Ok . Hes in between my fingers . Can I make a suggestion ? Can I just - Can I go in there and get him out ? No , you 're not gonna go in there ! No . Of course you 're not , because I have to maintaine quarantine . You know , I can do this . I can ... I can do this . - Can you try and distract it . - Yes . Yes . I 'll see if I can interest it in the wand . Go on , my favorite little muffin . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . He lost interest . He 's got hold of my hand . Argh ! Hugh ? Hugh ? Hey , Hugh ! - What the fuck is going on ? - No ! No one is going in ! - Come on ! - Wait ! Who 's going in ? - Waiting for fucking what ? - I 'm going in there ! Don 't , don 't do this ! Ah ... Argh ! I don 't give a shit about your fucking quarantine ! We gotta - Who gave you the fukin ' jurisdiction ? Just open the door ! Open ! Wait , wait , wait , wait ! He 's out . He 's out . Guys , look at it . - Oh , Jesus . - What are his vitals ? 126 and dropping . What 's it doing ? Holy shit . Jesus Christ . Okay . You guys got eyes on it anywhere ? Hey , there . There . Guys ? - Fuck this ! - No ! - Let him go . - Hey buddy . - Watch his hand . - He 's heavy . Get him in ! Adams ! - Yeah . - David , I need you here . Rory .. I can 't let you out . Oh ... shit ! Hugh , Hugh ? - Look at me . - Just listen me for a second . Ok ? Hey guys ? - Suggestions ? - Get the oxygen candle ! Burn it off ! Yeah , yeah , yeah yeah . Fuck . Okay . Alright . What now ? How do we get him out ? We need to get Calvin back behind firewall 1 . And once he 's there , we can pull Rory out . Fuck this . Permission ... to fucking kill the thing . Commander ? Kill it . Sho ? Any suggestions ? - What about the incinerator ? - I like that . Alright . Genius . Here . Close the red valve . Disengage the clamp . Disconnect the hose . - Be careful , Rory . - Fuck ! There is limited fuel . - Manual override . - Thank you . Okay . Rory , I ... Yeah . Fuck ! You 're wasting too much fuel . Fuck . Rory ! Rory ? Hey ! Rory , stop . Stop ! Rory ? You 're out of fuel . It 's behind you ! Jesus ! Fuck ! Somebody open up the fucking door ! And I 'm gonna pull him out ! Just open up the door ! There 's a man there that is getting strangled . Rory ? What are you saying ? Rory ? Rory ? - Kat ! We gotta open the door ! - No ! It is the protocol ! What is this fucking protocol ! Just open the portal ! - Rory ? - There 's a man dying in there ! Rory ? Can you hear ... Calm down ! Rory ? Rory ? We have a man dying in there ! Guys ? Guys . Sho . It 's so much bigger . Jesus ! - Guys ? - Sho . Guys , it 's trying to get out . - The CPU overruled us . - It 's searching for a way out . - The system won 't give me access to it . - Go manual . Shut them down . Okay ? - How smart is this thing ? - It feels the air flow . - I can 't control them all at once . - Then shut them one by one . Seal the lab ! - Shut it down . Shut it down now ! - We 're on it . Guys , it 's gone . - It got out . - Where did it go ? Could be anywhere now . Firewall 2 has failed . Kat We need to re-establish quarantine . I 'll get a distress call out . Control , this is Station . Station to Control . The specimen 's location is unknown . It is to be considered hostile and deadly . Our intent is to isolate and destroy it in compliance with protocol . We will continue said course of action unless otherwise instructed . - Please acknowledge and advice . - Kat . We lost them . - How much of that went out ? - Some .. I think . There is no way to be sure . Looks like communications just failed . Can we talk to each other ? David ? It 's Kat . Do you copy ? Go for David . - Still , we 've lost contact with Earth . - I dont think ... Wait . - Yes , outside communications are down . - Could the sprinklers affect comms ? No . They are independent systems . Can we run a diagnostic from here ? The transmitter has failed . But , we have to go outside to access it and get Earth back online . Then I have to walk . Let me . No . After Rory , I 'm best qualified for walk and repair . This is not protocol . It 's way too risky for you go out there to fix the comms . We don 't know where Calvin is . Haven 't had your Nitrogen detox . Your health is my responsibility . - I 'll be fine . - Yep . What is it you say ? " Slow is fast " , right ? - Yeah . " Slow to go fast . " - Yeah . Well , that 's out the window . We can escape in our lifeboats . Earth is the responsibility . Nothing goes down to the planet . It was stipulated in writing . What are you talking about ? What was stipulated in a writing ? What was stipulated ? David , first things first . When we 're back in touch with Control , we 'll turn our attention to Calvin . Don 't worry . Rate : 61 beats per minute . Pressure : 97 / 53 . I 'd hate to see you relaxed . But she is relaxed . Aren 't you , Kat ? Suit 's running warm . Like Siberia in summer . I 'm at the transmitter . Commencing on site diagnostics . It overheated . I can tell . How ? I see scorching . I will pitch up the coolant levels . Is it possible Calvin could 've gotten into coolant ? - Possible . - We have to know . - There is the issue . - Commander ? It 's bone dry . Calvin is a carbon-based organism . It needs food , water , and oxygen . Just like us . We have to consider the possibility it consumed the coolant for food . David , could you list all the water sources aboard ? Pure or otherwise . There is plenty of drinking water . There 's coolant for the comms , coolant for the CPU and there is coolant for the .. Commander ? Calvin just came out , then grabbed to my suit . It 's bigger . - It 's trying to get in . - Trust your suit . - Can it breathe out there ? - No . But it might be able to store oxygen for a period of time . I 'm closing the valve . - It 's squeezing . - Kat , Kat . Are you okay ? Yes . The suit is thick enough . It 's twisting up your leg . Go , go to the airlock now . Oh , fuck this . I 'm headed to the airlock . I 'll burn this fucker off ! Kat . Focus on meeting David . We will worry about the comms later . Sho ? There is liquid in the helmet . Calvin must have broken my coolant tube . - Kat , there is enough coolant . - Yes I know . I know . David ... meet me at the airolck . What ? Yeah . Go , go , go ! It 's is squeezing harder . Calvin cracked the cooling system in her suit . Commander . Calvin knows exactly what he is doing . It 's growing smarter . The liquid is blocking my vision . I don 't have time . I 've got to jump . - Kat , the tether won 't reach . - I 'm unclipping . - Kat ? - No comments . I 've got to jump . David , I 've taken care of the channel . She is not gonna tell you , but her heart is beating out of her chest . She is drowning . So just be prepared , she may not be rational . Copy that . Sho , I got no time for EVA . Using the launch suit . - It 's not designed for this . - I know . There 's not enough protection . - I know , don 't worry . - Kat is less than a minute out . - Check the airlock ! - What about decompression ? - Just do it ! - It 's gonna hurt . - Come on , do it ! - Is your helmet sealed ? Sho ! Guys , we 're running out of time . - Kat . Kat . - Don 't swallow it . It 's toxic , okay ? I need you to help me open the valve . We 'll do it together , okay ? I 'm gonna pull down , and you 're gonna go clockwise from your side . Okay ? There you go . Good , good , good . Don 't worry about Calvin . We are gonna get you inside and get it off . Kat ? No , clockwise from your side ! Clockwise from your side ! Kat , come on ! - Miranda ? - Yeah , I 'm here . She 's fighting me ! She 's turned the lever the wrong way ! Hold .. Kat , you 're fighting me Kat . Come on ! - We gotta do it together now ! Come on ! - David ? Kat , come on , please ! Kat , come on ... - Kat . - Look at me ! - Kat ! - Just pull on the lever , okay ? Kat , come on ! Come on ! Just pull down on the lever ! - David , she ... - Kat ! Come on , you can do this ! David , she 's doing it deliberately . Come on ! Kat ! - Kat ! - David , stop . Stop . She 's not letting Calvin back in here . Kat . Commander ... Kat . Kat . What 's going on ? What is going on ? Guys , guys , do you copy ? - Yeah , yeah I copy . - Okay , okay ... Just keep it together . We may have ... We may have an opportunity here . Calvin 's ability to survive in that vacuum and temperature is astonishing . But it can 't live much longer out there . Sho ? Sho ? Are you sure that we 've lost all communication with Earth ? I am sure . Alright then . We have to keep him out there . We have a new firewall . David . Can you see it ? I 'm seeing ... Sho ? - Yes . - Can you re-flood the airlock ? You tell me when . Okay . Did she close that valve ? Oh , yeah , yeah she closed it . Ok . What are the ways through he get in ? The thrusters . The manifolds in the thruster nozzles . If he tries one , we could blast it off . But we 'd have to know which . It 's too dark . I can 't see anything . There must be some way . Thruster sensors . If it climbs in the nozzle , the temperature should move . Should . Alright . - There ! - Thruster 2 . Firing . Miranda , can you reach Tranquility ? We missed ! Cut it ! Guys , it 's heading toward that way . No , no ! It 's heading towards the lab ! It 's fast ! - I 'm sorry , guys , I can 't see . - It 's okay , we 'll watch it . - Kibo . - Thruster 3 . Firing . Come on ! Please , please . - Thruster 5 . David , can you see it ? - Thruster 5 . Sho ? - What was that ? - We 've burnt through too much fuel . - There . - We were already low after the Pilgrim . Doc , listen . All this thrusting ... We 've placed ourselves into decaying orbit . Shit . We 'll reach atmosphere soon , if I don 't get us back to stable . And I 'll need the rest of the fuel to do it , if we even have that much . No . David ? David , we can 't risk Calvin riding us down into the atmosphere . Ok ? I don 't know if it could have survived it . We don 't know . He 's already gone well beyond what any living organism should be able to survive . If it 's between letting it in here , or letting it down there ... We let it in here . Where are you ? We 've just let it back in here . Moving us back into stable orbit . These creatures could have dominated Mars for hundreds of millions of years . But now we know that they hibernate for the loss of atmosphere . If we deprive it of air , retreat to Tranquility and seal ourselves off And vent the rest of the station . Exactly . No life support , no life . Right . Ok , Hugh and I will sweep from quest east . And ... You and Sho scout the poles and lock off each compartment . This will take about ... four hours to vent all oxygen . - What do we do till then ? - We wait . You okay ? Derry , look at me . You okay ? I 'm fine . I remember the day the Challenger blew up . They took us out of school early . I remember that day . It 's hard to watch people die . Like ... Fireworks . Up , up . A long , delirious , burning blue . I topped the windswept heights with ease and grace . Best eulogy ever . Rory 'd say us ... " Don 't give me an eulogy . " " Give me a parachute . " He was my buddy . It 's my fault . It 's all my fault . Maybe it was your fault , maybe it was my fault . Maybe . Now it doesn 't matter , does it ? Getting this thing onboard was a risk and we knew it from the beginning . We took it . It 's just surviving . Life 's very existence requires destruction . Calvin doesn 't hate us . But he has to kill us in order to survive . Hugh ? Hugh ? Hugh ? Alright , alright . Hey , Hugh . It 's fine . Sorry , because of all the ... - Hugh ? - Hugh ? There is no output . Okay . Get at the defib . Get him right . Okay . - Get him down . - I 'll strap him in . - Take off the sling . Okay ? - Yeah . Sho , get the ACLS kit and the defibrillator . Shit . Here . Prep the defibrillator and get the shocks now . - 360 joules . - Copy , 360 joules . Charging . Clear . - Charging . - Still defibrillator in . Just stuck the shocks if you have to . Go , 360 ! Alright . Clear ! - Nothing . - Go again . 360 . - Go Again , hit him . - Clear . Alright , alright . I 'm getting output . Yeah ? Ok , sinus rate : 98 beats pm . You really scared me there , buddy . David ? David ? - What is this ? - Stabilizing . - Get the plasma cutter . - Calvin 's feeding off his leg . Go . Get out of here . Let 's go ! Miranda , let 's go ! Pull away from Hugh ! - We 'll come back for him ! - Let 's go ! Sho ! No ! - Sho ! - No ! Guys ? - Calvin ? - We don 't know where he is . - Where is Sho ? - He 'll be fine . We stopped all oxygen venting in the station . Lift me up . Oh ... Miranda . Up . Up . I 'm coming home , Mei . You know what I feel is not scientific . It 's not rational . I feel hate . I feel pure ... fucking ... hate for that thing . Calvin . How is that moving like that ? He must have swallowed the marker on Derry 's leg . Yeah . We can track it . Let 's kill this thing ! Lifting " Zarya " now . Ok , it 's suffocating . How long do you think that 's gonna take ? I don 't know . Proximity alert . Proximity alert . Proximity alert . Proximity alert . Proximity alert . They 're coming . Kat 's distress call must have reached Earth . Right , where are they docking ? - Shit . Looks like " Zarya " . - Jesus , that 's where Calvin is . Station to " Soyuz " . Station to " Soyuz " , do you copy ? Station to " Soyuz " , do you copy ? - Station to " Soyuz " , do you copy ? - Try the flashlight . Come on , come on ! They can 't see this . Must be too reflective . Shit . What the fuck are they doing ? David . David ! They are not coming to rescue us . - It 's firewall 3 . - What ? Firewall 1 was the box . The firewall 2 was the lab . The firewall 3 is the station . - But we have a new firewall . - They don 't know that . And if firewall 1 or 2 fail , they have two choices . They can contain ... or they expel . They 're pushing us out to deep space . They cannot risk Calvin reaching Earth . It was my protocol . I insisted from the beginning , and the committee agreed . They all put their names to it . The list is as long as your arm . Look , protective firewalls is my job . And if we would have succeeded , we could have gone home . And if we fail ... Wait for me , Mei . Sho . Oh , he thinks it 's a rescue . God ! He 's heading towards Calvin . Sho ! Sho , can you hear us ? Sho ! Sho ! - Sho ! - Take my hand ! Don 't let go Sho ! No , don 't , don 't let go ! No ! No ! No ! No ! - No ! - Let go ! No ! Sho ! Miranda ! Miranda ! The CPU is still up . It 's a miracle . We 're ... We 're losing life support . The temperature is dropping rapidly . Atmosphere 's venting from everywhere , and I don 't know how to stop it . - Ok , how much time do we have ? - In here ? Two hours , maybe an hour and 45 . I need a ... - What ? - Fuck . - Fuck . Fuck . - What ? What is it ? - What ? - We 're ... We 're not moving into space . The opposite . All that fucked up thrusting , we are decaying again . What ? Sho has a subroutine here . Without any correction in course , which we don 't have any fuel for anyway ... We 'll hit the atmosphere in ... 39 minutes . We 're not gonna survive re-entry . But Calvin could . It 's so cold . My father used to read this to me when I was a kid . Goodnight , room . Goodnight , Moon . Good night , cow jumping over the moon . Good night , light and the red balloon . Goodnight , nobody . I remember when I saw my first picture of Earth . And I asked my father where all those ... all those lines were . The borders . I really miss him .

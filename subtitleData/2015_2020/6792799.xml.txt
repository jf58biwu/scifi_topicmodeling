We 're not sure at least not at this moment , whether we are under ... Nobody even knows what the hell 's going on . They 're just throwing darts against the wall . Is this about the planes from this morning ? Where have you guys been ? I mean , the last plane was like , an hour ago ! I mean , nine planes , that ain 't no accident . ... pray for those who have had family or friends involved ... - in these terrible tragedies . - What did they hit ? All kinds of stuff . And all over the place too . I mean , this isn 't like 9 / 11 . That was like ... The tenth plane just went down over the Dallas , Texas area . That makes ten planes down in just a matter of the past few hours . And the stock market is going to close early to avoid any impact on the economy until we know more . So far an estimated 754 have been killed in the past several hours which is the second worst disaster in aviation history . - The only other event ... - Come on . ... more lives have been lost was of course September 11th , 2001 ... - Dave . - ... at which time , 2,907 people perished .

TOMMY : Where did you come from ? Haven 't you been seeing everything that 's been happening ? - DAVID : I 'm just trying to get back home . - Bad idea . The only real protection you 're going to have is at the evacuation point . You 're smart to stay there . I 'm not far from the north end of the valley . I need to find my family ... There 's nothing there . What ? Everything 's gone . Everyone 's dead . You sure ? My wife is still there . The entire valley is gone . Amy . - Amy . - [ NOT CONNECTED TONE ] [ ON RADIO ] It can be characterized by depression , apathy , fatigue . Intense hunger and insomnia . - Oh , shit ! - [ TIRES SCREECH ] Hey , man . You okay ?

So , uh ... you from around here ? Finally . All this time and no other cars on the road , it 's just ... it 's just too weird . Look , are you on something ? 'Cause this is starting to get really old . MAN : Light . DAVID : Yeah , yeah , lights . It looks like they 've set the roadblock . MAN : Light ! What is wrong with you ? Okay ? Why do you keep mentioning the light ? - Light ! - What about the damn light ? Okay , let 's get this guy up . We 'll take him and whoever needs medical attention first . [ STRANGE NOISES ] [ SPACESHIP NOISES ] - OFFICER : You need any help ? - Hey , I got this ... - I just want to get home to my family . - Roads are closed to all westbound traffic . It 's all I can tell you . What 's wrong with that guy ? I don 't know . I saw him outside the tunnel , I picked him up . This guy keeps freaking out about a light . Maybe I can leave him here with you guys and someone , tell someone ... No , sir . That 's not going to work , we can 't do that . - Hey ! - Hey , sir ! You 're gonna have to keep moving . You 'll have to drop him off ... What the hell are you doing ? Please . They 're here . How far are we talking ? You see something ? David ? I 'll be right there . Sam .

All right , let 's go . [ BRANCH SNAPS ] - [ LASER BLASTS ] - [ SCREAMING ] [ ALIEN NOISES ] [ LASER BLASTS ] Hey , up here . Yeah , Tommy , you first . [ LASER BLAST ] [ LASER BLAST ] [ ALIEN NOISES ] Wait ! Wait . - Start it , get out of here ! - Wait . There 's still more people out there . - There 's no way they made it . - We have to wait . - I 'm telling you there 's no point ! - Of course there 's a point . No , I 'm not being heartless . I 'm being reasonable . Come on . We 're gonna get killed if we sit here . That 's them . [ DISTANT SCREAM ] [ LASER BLASTS ] - There 's too many . - We have to go . There 's too many . - Go . Come on , go . - [ LASER BLASTS ] [ ENGINE REVS ] It 's okay . What 's okay ? We just left all those people out there to die . No . We didn 't have time . They would have killed us too . I could have waited . I could have fit a few of them . - They were already dead . - That 's bullshit , okay ? All right , we saw them running . I saw them running . I ... I can 't make that excuse . It 's just how it is . How can you act like that when there 's innocent people out there being killed , huh ? Hey . If you 've been in your car this whole time let me tell you , you have some shit ahead of you . I 've seen enough death in the last 14 hours to know how to save myself . - I 'm not trying to be heartless . - Pick up . Pick up . Is that your family ? It 's my wife . Do you have kids ? No . Could you imagine if you did ? During a time like this , how would you explain it to them ? - Or protect them ? - It 'd be a nightmare . - What were you waiting for ? - What ? You and your wife . Why were you waiting to have kids ? Isn 't that a bit forward of you , don 't you think ? I 'm just talking . You know , we never even wanted kids . You 're married , it 's just what other people want from you . So what was your excuse then ? I don 't know . I guess at first it was work , mostly . We 're full time , then we were overtime . I don 't know , I guess we both just wanted to get to a certain point before we felt like we could ... you know , settle down ... eventually . Eventually . So you really think you 're going to find your wife in all this mess ? Yes . If I were you I 'd prepare yourself not to . You know what , I don 't need this . Okay ? - Don 't talk like that ... - I 'm not trying to ... No , no , it 's none of your business . She 's smart , all right ? She 'll be fine . You 're right . She could be out there . But I just don 't think that it 's a good idea for you to go out looking for her . Well , thank you for your sympathy . It would be nice to save at least one life today . That 's all I 'm saying . I 'll be fine . I 'm Samantha . I 'm David . [ KEYS RATTLE ] [ ENGINE REVS ] [ PHONE VIBRATES ] - Hi . - DAVID : [ ON PHONE ] Oh , thank God . - Are you okay ? - AMY : Yeah . Had a hell of a time getting a hold of you . Yeah , the news said that most of the cell phone towers are down . Yeah , most of the roads are closed too . Is everything okay ? - No . - Are you hurt ? Kylie 's sick . She ... she couldn 't move her body . She couldn 't ... I don 't know what 's wrong with her . Where is she ? Um ... a neighbor took her to the vet . [ KNOCK AT DOOR ] Thank God you 're all right . Wait , what time is it ? Almost 3 . I couldn 't wait . After last night I had to see you . - What 's been happening ? - Haven 't you seen the news ? I feel asleep . Is it anything ? Did I miss something ? Let 's get you some coffee . You have no idea how good it is to be here . It could be something atmospheric , okay ? That 's causing planes to crash . It could be something extra terrestrial . Basically , it 's beyond our field of vision right now . It 's a black swan event and we 're not equipped to deal with it . [ KYLIE WHIMPERS ] BRAD : My neighbor 's a vet . He works out of his house . I 'm gonna take her . Wait . I can 't leave . - Not with everything that 's going on . - What could possibly happen here ? I don 't know . I can 't not be here if they come back . I don 't know what to do . When I was driving over here today ... there was only one thing that I could think of . All the money , all the success , it meant nothing . The only thing that mattered to me was that I got one more chance to see you . And tell you that the only way that anything could matter again is if we could share it together . You and me . I can 't . Yes , you can . You know what you have right here . Right now . - Don 't , that 's not fair . - None of this is fair , Amy . We don 't know how much time we have left with everything that 's going on . I want this . I want us . I have to stay . Even if there 's just a small chance , I have to . If I leave right now without you , there is no way that we can know what could happen . Come on . I can 't . DAVID : [ ON PHONE ] That 's good . That 's good . She 's gonna be okay . Just stay inside , okay ? Mmm-hmm . Babe , I 'm having a really hard time staying awake . I 'm just gonna pull over really quick and just take a quick nap . I 'm really tired . Look , I 'm gonna get back to you , okay ? I 'm gonna make it back to you . You trust me ? I trust you . Everything 's gonna be okay . So , Samantha ... no kids , then ? No . Well , did you have an excuse ? Well , when I first got married we ... said that we would wait until we could afford to get a pool for the backyard . But I don 't think that was it . He got a good job , and I got a better job . We surpassed that . We even got the pool for the backyard . But we stopped talking about having kids . It 's so interesting , isn 't it ? What people think marriage is for at the beginning . It 's like a ... a free ticket out of our old life . It 's always going to be better . Or at least you 're not gonna grow old and die alone with no one beside you . But for me , that ... that dull ache that ... comes from disappointing someone . That ... that never really went away , for me . Even ... even in the good times . We were married seven years . We had the divorce papers ready to sign ... before all this ... happened . With the strange timing of it all , I still managed ... to become separated . All those feelings that you have at the end shouldn 't ... shouldn 't make up for all the ... boredom and disappointment that ... that you felt before , should they ? DAVID : You know the software that I got you last year makes changing the music much easier ? There 's no connection to the notes . I like writing by hand . Um , I was gonna take Kylie out . Decompress a bit . You want to take a break and come along ? You know , I 'm ... I 'm kind of at a place where I shouldn 't stop . Yeah , no problem . I 'm taking the job with Brad . So ... so that 's it then ? You 've decided . One of us has to do something . One less thing for us to not talk about . Come on . Seriously ? - It 's not always like this . - I know how it is . I have to go to Denver . Maybe that 's best . [ PHONE VIBRATES ] - Hello ? - RYAN : [ ON PHONE ] I wasted it . Ryan , where are you ? I 'm alone . And you know who gives a shit ? No one . - Settle down . You 've been drin ... - Damn right I 've been drinking . Nobody even knows I 'm here , Amy . Tori 's probably dead and David bailed . And ... and it hits me ... I 've got ... nothing . [ CHILD CRIES ] Oh , hey , hey , it 's okay . Hey . Shh ... WHISPERS : Hey , there . Hi . Where 's your family at ? You know , I don 't know where my family is either . Can I sit here ? It looks like you have an owie there , huh ? David ... is he ... is he home yet ? Oh , let me take a look . It 's gonna be okay . Is that your bow ? Okay . Will you hold this here for me ? You know , I could be looking to find my family a long time so maybe we should just try and ... try and find yours , okay ? Now what direction do you think they went ? Oh , that way ? Okay . Okay . Come here . Come here . RYAN : [ ON PHONE ] He knows it 's over . - What ? - David . He knows it 's over between you two . He told me how rough it 's been . [ PHONE BEEPS ] Of course . Dammit . What are you doing ? Are you okay ? What are you doing out here alone ? Where 's your family ? [ GUNSHOT ] Get away from her ! DAVID : I was just trying to make sure she was alright . Hey , I 'm on your side . Does your phone work ? Hello ? Is she okay ? Get out of here ! I just want to get home . Do you know the quickest way to Salt Lake ? Get off my land ! Okay , alright . You got it . I 'm just gonna get some water . And then ... then I 'm leaving . I really appreciate this . No ! No ! It 's in the water . Whatever they 're bringing , it 's ... They put something in the water . They got my animals . They got my family . They ain 't getting no more ! - So , who 's ... who 's they ? - [ ALIEN NOISES ] [ GUNSHOT ] Jesus , man . What is it ? In or out . Let 's go ! [ GUNSHOT ] Those bastards want a fight , they got it . Damn it , Caitlyn ! I said no more ! No more ! No more ! [ DOORKNOB RATTLES ] [ DOORKNOB RATTLES ] [ GUN COCKS ] [ WHISPERS ] Anything comes through that door , I 'm emptying this thing . [ DOOR OPENS ] Oh , shit ! I forgot to lock the back door . [ STRANGE NOISE ] [ DOOR CREAKS ] Oh , shit ! - Caitlyn , no ! Stop ! - [ LASER BLAST ] [ ALIEN NOISES ] [ YELLING AND GUNFIRE ] Sam ! [ MUFFLED SCREAMS ] [ GUNSHOT ] Lori ? Lori ? Sam , what happened ? Sam ? Someone help us ! Sam , I 'm gonna go get my keys . Sam , you stay with her , okay ? - FARMER : No ! No ! - [ LASER BLASTS ] [ THUD ] [ FOOTSTEPS ] AMY : Brad wants to start a firm with me . DAVID : That was Brad Klick ? What about Chemtech ? AMY : He quit , two weeks ago . And he already has everything in place . New office . New clients . We 'll be smaller , but I 'll have my name on something . I 'll actually feel like I 'm making a difference . Well , what about things around here ? - That is so unfair . - What ? Don 't make me feel guilty about this . What have you done for us ? I 'm going to that wedding with you tomorrow . I mean ... She 's your cousin ! Did you quit your job ? Or put your dreams on hold ? Have you done anything for us ? I 've cut way back on work . You know that . Then where are you every day ? Every night . - Just give me a minute , okay ? I got ... - [ PHONE VIBRATES ] Oh ! And I can 't compete with your damn phone ! I 'm done ! Okay , fine ! It 's off now ! Now everything is going to be better ! Maybe now with my phone off , we might be able to have a conversation at dinner . Or no , no , maybe all our fights will turn into polite discussions ! I should 've known the whole time it 's been this phone . The phone is the only problem . It 's just the phone ! [ FOOTSTEPS ] [ STAIRS CREAK ] [ ALIEN NOISE ] [ LASER BLAST ] [ ALIEN NOISE ] - [ ALIEN NOISE ] - [ LASER BLAST ] [ AMY SCREAMS ] David ? You want me to take over ? No . No , I 'm good . I think I know where we are now . I can get us into the valley if you want to take a nap . That 's okay , No , really , I 'm good . [ SLAMMING NOISE ] Shit ! What was that ? Was that a person ? I didn 't get a good look , I ... [ ALIEN NOISES ] It 's one of them . We gotta go . Wait , no . What ? Samantha , come on . We don 't have time for this . I 'm not gonna pick that up . How else are you gonna protect yourself ? Think about it . [ ALIEN NOISE ] - [ ENGINE STRUGGLES ] - DAVID : No , no , no , no . - What ? What 's wrong with it ? - Shit . Shit . Shit . - What 's wrong ? - Come on ! - What ? - I don 't know . It 's not working . - Shh . What is that ? - [ ALIEN NOISE ] It 's just leaving it there . Did you expect something different ? Well , how far do you think we have ? Four or five miles , probably . - Let 's get out of here . - Okay . - So , you know this road ? - Yeah . I 'm pretty sure . - Okay . - It 's somewhere , okay ? If it 's not at the mouth of the canyon , then it 's close . - Well , what if it isn 't ? - Then I 'll keep walking ' til I find it . No , what if there is no evacuation point ? If there isn 't , then I 'm dead . You know , you can stick with me if you ... if you want . Thanks . I just don 't understand how you 're so comfortable with the idea of death . - The same goes for you . - I 'm not comfortable with dying . Are you ... are you okay ? - You hurt ? - No , I just wanted to lay down . God , that 's so embarrassing . - No , I 'm fine . - Are you tired or ... No , it 's pretty nice down here . Actually . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Are you gonna let me look at that ? Please ? - No . It ... it 's fine . - No . It needs to be cleaned . Maybe , yeah . No . It 's not gonna take that long , and you need to take a break anyway . Here . - Okay . - I 'm so glad I found a doctor . Shut up . I 'm just tired of watching you limp around everywhere . So ... - So ? - What do you want to talk about ? [ GROANING ] AMY : [ ON PHONE ] David ... They killed Sam and Lori and they tried to kill me too . And I don 't know what to do . I never thought I 'd have to prepare for this . I 'm sorry . I lied about Brad . He came over and ... he 's been over before , and it didn 't mean anything . SAMANTHA : Sorry . Does that hurt ? Are you okay ? No , it feels great . Yeah . Okay . Come on . Talk to me for once . I 'll talk , it 's just ... I don 't have much to say . Now I know you 're lying . What 's Amy like ? She 's ... she 's strong . And a lot of other things . Is she happy ? Um ... that 's a good question . You know , I could guess , but ... I 've been wrong before . She doesn 't smile much . But she 's always kind of been that way . When I first met her , I just ... I thought she was unhappy . I guess that didn 't stop me though . I messed up a lot . Especially at the beginning , I ... I was unfaithful . One night , I told her . And then I just left . I didn 't give her time to even react . I just ... I didn 't want to see it . So a few days later , I went to the house ... and , um ... she met me at the door , and , uh ... she smiled . Quitting hadn 't even crossed her mind . I , um ... I stayed . I felt like she deserved for me to not quit . So you 're ... looking for her so you can go sweep her off her feet ? I don 't know why I 'm looking for her . I haven 't been happy in a long time . And , um ... even if I do find her , I ... I don 't know what will happen . Maybe she doesn 't want to be found . - She does . - [ HELICOPTER APPROACHES ] SAMANTHA : The evacuation . Come on . Hurry . - Hey ! - Hey ! We 're looking for the evacuation point . We got everyone out . We 're en route to Fort Carson . We 've got room , but we gotta go now ! Come on ! - David ! - Hey , we gotta go ! - She 's not there . - How do you know that ? We 're too far from home . She can 't be out here ! Come on ! Please , David ! I don 't want you to die !

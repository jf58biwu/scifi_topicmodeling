 My name is H.G. Wells . I discovered that my friend John is Jack the Ripper . He 's escaped from 1893 in my time machine , and I 'm the only one who can catch him . I 'm obliged to take you back to Scotland Yard . I 'm not going anywhere . I 've yet to begin in this age . Jane Walker , assistant curator . So , really , who are you ? I 'm certain you won 't believe the answer to that question . What if I can prove to you that I 'm telling the truth ? - Are you really H.G. Wells ? - Flesh and blood . I find you , Jane Walker , particularly special . I must find my friend . He 's killed many women in London , and now he 's killed again . He wants the key ... this key . - You don 't belong in this time . - Do it . Do it ! Jane ? Jane ? _ Hello , Mr. Wells . I 'm Vanessa . I 'm your great-great-granddaughter . How can I possibly be related to you ? I 've never met you before in my life . But I 've met you in my life . That 's impossible . So is time travel , but here you are . I have to find John . He will kill her . He would have done that already . He wants something . What is it , Mr. Wells ? Is it the key ? How do you know about the key ? Please . They 're gone . Come with me and I will help you find them . What are you doing ? - Stop . - Get off me . Get off me ! You can 't do this . - Get back here . - Wait , stop it . Stop . He will kill her . I must find Jane . Vanessa will be right with you . You said you would help me find Jane . How ? - You 've been hurt . You should sit down . - No , no , I 'm fine . Jane is all I care about right now . Please , let me look at that . We are wasting time . You can 't do anything if you bleed to death . Let me help you . You don 't want this to get infected . Searched Jane Walker 's apartment . I have her laptop , purse , and cellphone . - And your things . - Why do you have her belongings ? He 'll want to make contact . This will be his easiest route . Did you find the key ? No . It 's in my possession . Where it will stay . And that controls the time machine ? It controls who has the time machine . I designed it for safety . The machine always returns to the starting date of each voyage unless you have this key to override it . So if he gets the key in the time machine , he can go anywhere and kill anyone . And I will never be able to find him . Is the time machine safe ? It 's being guarded at the museum . Please , he will kill her . No , not if he wants the key . How do you know me ? You said that we were related . How is that possible ? I was hoping you might have some answers . I 've traced my genealogy , but I can 't find a genetic connection . You said that we 've met before . My freshman year in college , I was walking on campus . You came running up to me , out of breath , in a hurry , and said that you were H.G. Wells . I thought you were crazy . The whole thing sounds crazy . But then you said you were my great-great-grandfather . It was insane . You were rambling . You told me about the time machine , Jack the Ripper . You spoke of the key and a woman in danger . None of this makes any sense . That 's what I said . Then you handed me a letter . You ... said for me to find the time machine . I wrote you a letter ? No , you wrote you a letter . You knew you wouldn 't believe you either . It 's my handwriting . " It 's true , H.G. , don 't be daft . " Believe it . H.G. " I wrote this , but ... This symbol , what does it mean ? I 've researched it , but there 's no record of it . Why didn 't I write more ? And where did John take Jane ? Details would be very handy right now . I have to find her . Don 't worry , we will . Going somewhere , dear ? Sit you back down over here , shall we ? You feisty little bugger . Right . What is your telephone number ? Why ? Because I need to have a little at with your new beau . I don 't ... Herbert George Wells , remember him ? He has something that I want , and I have something that he wants . I need your telephone number . How do you know he has my phone ? Well , he 's naive and pathetic . He 's not stupid . Your number . I 'm not gonna help you . Thought that 's what you might say . I 'd like you to meet our very gracious hostess , Julia Milton . Her friends call her Jules . 28 , single , from Richmond , Virginia , currently working as a fashion consultant with Macy 's where she makes a staggering $ 165,000 a year . Isn 't that mad ? Did you know this apartment costs $ 8,000 a month ? I mean , th-th-the economics of this period are just absurd . Now , I really , really think it 's time you made that call , don 't you ? Blocked caller . This could be him . Now , you need to talk to him , but don 't mention us . He doesn 't know you have help . It 's our best weapon against him . Hello ? You don 't have to shout , H.G. You can speak at a decent room level . Where 's Jane ? She 's right here . Go on , say hello . I 'm here . I 'm fine . If you harm her in any way ... Dear God , H.G. , the role of hero 's really not in your arsenal , is it ? - I mean it , John . - Yes , of course you do . Now , I want the key to the time machine . Meet me at the bridge in Central Park tomorrow at noon . Key gets you Jane . Where is Central Park ? Oh , you 're a clever bunny , you 'll figure it out . No police , just you . Alone . Key or Jane dies . Ahh ! _ It 's okay . - We have to hurry . - Where is he ? I hit him over the head . He 's unconscious . Come on . He 's gonna wake up . Stop , he 's gonna wake up . No , no , no . Shh . Okay , okay , come on past . Please don 't wake up . The stairs will be faster . - Come here ! - Ahh ! Ah , ah , I wouldn 't do that . Walk out that door , and she 's dead . Please . Are you sure you want to know ? They 're my books . Yeah , but you haven 't written them yet . If you read them now , won 't it affect what you write ? Or will it inform what I write ? Hell if I know . Me neither , I 'm afraid . Has there been any word on Jane Walker 's whereabouts ? John was calling from a burner phone , which makes it harder to trace . I have no idea what that means . It means it will take more time to find his location . Right . And where is Central Park ? We still have some time . Let me get Ms. Anders for you . - Hey , Carl , how you doing ? - All right . Hello , there . I 'm Griffin Monroe . Herbert George Wells . Pleasure . I 'm sorry ... what did you say your name was again ? Hey . Honey . - Hi . - Good morning . Has there been any news regarding Ms. Walker ? Nothing yet . - Doug ? - Right this way . - Hi . - Hi . - Who 's that ? - You didn 't get my message ? - When did you send the message ? - I texted you this morning . Is there a problem ? Not everyone knows you 're H.G. Wells . - We need to keep it on the down low . - I see , of course . He said he was H.G. Wells . - What ? That 's impossible . - No , it 's exactly what he said . Well , he 's not . He 's ... George Wells , a descendant of H.G. Wells . - A descendant ? - Yes . I met him in London , years ago , when I found the time machine and I was having it restored . Yeah . He 's in town just for the exhibit at the museum . You didn 't mention he was coming . - Oh , it 's been a crazy week . - Oh . Ah . Remember we have lunch with Stuart . God , I 'm so sorry . I have to cancel . - Please don 't hate me . - We can reschedule . No , it 's about your campaign , and I totally screwed up . It 's really not a big deal . - Thank you , Senator . - Oh , not yet . You 've been granted a reprieve due to the feisty little vixen in the next room . Now , now , don 't get too cozy . Well , it is ... that is soft , isn 't it ? Oh , it 's like a cloud . They really have figured some of these things out , haven 't they ? Let her go . You don 't need her . You have me . I have her to keep you in line . I hurt my arm . I need to clean it . I wouldn 't worry about a little scrape on your arm . You 'll be dead soon enough . You 're not gonna kill me . What makes you think that ? You would have done it by now . Besides , you need access to the time machine once you have the key . Well , aren 't you the clever one . Take a seat . Convenient . Come on , let 's have a look at your arm . Come on , I 'm a doctor . Prestigious surgeon , in fact . So why do you kill ? Do you like playing God ? Deciding who lives and who dies ? You 're a bold one with your questions . Why prostitutes ? Do you have something against women or just sex ? Be careful with your tongue . I do not allow women to speak to me this way . Well , when you get in that time machine , make sure you go backwards . Won 't get any better for you in the future where women are concerned . And how do you know so much about me ? Everyone knows who you are . You 're Jack the Ripper . You 're famous . I 'm famous ? Most famous killer in the world . You didn 't know ? Figured you would have learned how to Google yourself by now . Tell me more . There 's a laptop over there . I can show you . Once I 've secured Jane 's safety , I will need to take John directly to the time machine . Can I ask a question ? Why can 't you simply go back in time and reverse this entire series of events ? Can 't you go back to the moment just before the Ripper escapes in your time machine and stop him ? One must be careful not to disrupt the very fabric of time . It is my theory ... every time we travel to the past or future , you prick the fabric of time . If you go too close to any one time repeatedly ... it can cause ... a hole in time . What happens then ? I 'm not sure . We melt , implode , cease to exist . I prefer not to find out . But that is why time travel is dangerous . In the wrong hands , it could , quite frankly , destroy the world . Okay , then . We 're better off with you meeting him in the park at noon . You 'll go to the bridge where my men and I will surprise him . Well , he specifically said to come alone . He 'll have no idea we 're there . We 'll grab him . Isn 't that what you want ? I want the safe return of Jane Walker . - That is my first priority . - Can 't we do both ? I have known John Stevenson for years . He is shrewd and cunning . He is not easily foiled . He may be Jack the Ripper , but he 's still from 1893 . His little knives won 't come close to my 9 millimeter Glock . Does everyone in this era carry a firearm ? - Pretty much . - Let Doug come with you . It 's too dangerous . The more people I involve , the more I risk altering time . There 's no telling the damage I 've caused thus far . I must do this alone . That is final . Very well . You will go alone . " Five prostitutes were killed . " The murders were misogynistic in nature , " suggesting a hatred for women . " No . That is simply inaccurate . I mean , I killed prostitutes because of the opportunity . They troll alleyways . They make it easy . I also killed vagrants and street urchins in equal measure . It says here I was never identified . I don 't even get credit for it ? Did I not mention ... you 're famous for being an anonymous killer ? What are you talking about ? No one knows my name ? Wells is famous . He accomplished something that endured , something good . Don 't be ridiculous . I 'm a decorated surgeon , highly regarded all over London . No , you 're Jack the Ripper , a faceless dark cloud on humanity . You want to know why I kill ? Because the only thing more fulfilling than saving a life is taking one . The instant sensation , the release it brings ... that slakes my thirst . You 're gonna go right through that entrance , follow the path , you can 't miss the bridge . Very well . I 'll be off . You 're not gonna give him the key , are you ? That 's not my intention . And when John realizes he 's being played ? All I care about is the safe return of Ms. Walker . All right . We 'll be here , waiting . For every step society takes forward , we take two steps back . We invent new technologies only to use them as weapons against one another . - We strive for equality - _ - yet we 're more divided than ever . - _ Look around you . Nations are at war . Violence runs rampant . Our days on this planet are numbered . Prepare yourself . The end is near . We are on the verge of all-out nuclear war . My word . Did your grandmother dress you this morning ? Hello , old friend . We are anything but friends . Oh , come on . That 's not true . We have a long history together . A few days in the future can 't change that . - Where 's Jane ? - Where 's the key ? When Jane is safe , I 'll give you the key . There you go again , trying to negotiate as if you had the upper hand . It 's bloody awful , isn 't it , this world ? Everybody 's so loud and angry about everything . Yelling , pushing , shoving ... I mean , it 's a battlefield to get an afternoon tea . Enough , John . I have the key . Where is Jane ? Do you really want to take me back to 1893 ? You must pay for your crimes . Well , a quick history lesson for you , H.G ... . I 'm never caught . You can look it up . You can Google it , in fact . So , this little power struggle will not yield you anything . - I never return to London . - Well , maybe it 's because you die . By your cowardly hands ? I think not . Don 't worry . She 's not far . Give me the key , and I 'll tell you where to find her . What are you looking at ? Where 's Jane ? Where is Jane ? Come on , give me the key . I 'll tell you where to find her . Come on . You can trust me . No , no , no , no , no , don 't . I had this under control . Hey , stop ! Kids ! Let 's go . Move . - Let 's go . - Let 's get out of here . You weren 't supposed to be here . And now she 's dead . You 've killed her . Ohhh . You lied to me . I am so sorry . I thought it was the right call . I couldn 't let you go alone . We should have something soon on the phone trace . You sealed her fate . She 's dead . I apologize , sir . I saw you give him the key , I gave the word to Carl to move in . Her death is on your head . But she is his only leverage over you . Why would he kill her ? Because he 's a madman , and we 've angered him . He could lose all reasoning . We will find her . No , you don 't understand . When I arrived , I was helpless , lost . She was the one person who showed me kindness . He will kill her just to get back at me . I know him . I 'm done here . - If you 'll excuse me . - Where are you going ? I wish to leave . Kindly step aside . You came to me all those years ago , and I 've waited a long time to understand my role in this . Let me fix this . I can help you . Am I a prisoner here ? Of course not . I insist you not follow me . I will not follow you . Are you serious ? - Ooh ! - Oof . - I am so sorry . - Eyes up , dude . My apologies , sir . Please forgive me . I 'll just ... - What the hell , man ? - I am so sorry . Uh , do you know which way downtown is ? Thank you so much . Are you following me ? What ? Did Vanessa send you to follow me ? Man , I don 't know you . I 'm just walking . Freak . Where did Wells get help ? Who are they ? I want out of this bloody time . Then go . Just leave , disappear . To hell with it . I don 't need the key . The time machine still works . I can go anywhere I bloody want . I 'll disappear into another time . No . You don 't have to kill her ! I know that . I want to . There 's no reason to , just leave ! Start over . You have an opportunity here . You can change . You can be someone new . Your legacy is that of a killer that nobody knows . What are you rambling about ? Somewhere inside , I know you hate it because I saw it in your face . You hate being Jack the Ripper , so why don 't you just stop this right here , right now ? Now I see why H.G. ' s so taken with you . You 're both full of the same idealistic rubbish . I am exactly who I want to be . No ! It 's okay . You 're safe now . - Do you know where he went ? - I couldn 't hear . Did he kill her ? The trace came through . We got an address . We 're there now . - Where 's Jane ? - John took her . They left about half an hour ago . Witness says he was pretty unhinged . Where would they go ? The museum will be closing in 10 minutes . Please proceed to the exits . The museum will be closing in 10 minutes . Please proceed to the exits . Hey , Jane . The exhibit 's closed . Yeah , I have , uh , an end-of-day report for Vanessa Anders . I won 't be long . Hurry up before they figure me out . Just go wherever you 're going . Go ! What ? You didn 't think I was gonna go alone now , did you ? No . No ! Let her go , John . I thought I might see you here . And here we are again . This isn 't about her . This is about you and me . Oh , like it was you and me in the park ? You must think I 'm a fool . There 's no one else here . I came completely alone . Well , then you 're the fool . Perhaps I am . But I am also in possession of the one thing that you want . I 'd say that makes the two of us . The key . Slide it to me . Oops . John , John . John ! John , you mustn 't do this . No , no , no , no , John , John . John . John . John , look at me . Don 't do this . John ! John , you 're making a huge mistake . - John ! - Come on . Can you stop him ? Come on . Come on . Come on , come on . Come on , come on . Come on , you . Ah ! Ugh ! Ah ! - You all right ? - Yes . Is he gone ? Hey ! Did you kill him ? It 's a stun gun . He 'll be fine . Are you okay ? I am now . No , no , no , I wouldn 't . Let 's move out ! Move ! The Wells exhibit ! Move ! Damn it , Wells . On the radio . Down here ! Call it in . We got a security officer down . - Got it ? - Yes , ma 'am . We spoke to the police . It 's being written up as vandalism . Museum 's on board with keeping it quiet . Great . Let 's wrap it up and get out of here . Can it be fixed ? Oh , never mind this . I 'm more concerned with you . Are you okay ? I 'm not gonna lie ... I was pretty scared . It 's your phone . Hello ? I 'm gonna make this short and sweet . I 'm going to kill one person every day until I get the time machine with the key . Do I make myself clear ? Yes , but ... Was that him ? Yes . He still wants the key . How are you , Miss Walker ? I 've been better . You 've been through quite an ordeal . You and that other woman are lucky to be alive . The woman from the apartment , - Jules , she 's alive ? - Yes . She 's shaken , but she 's okay . She didn 't hear or see much . She 's with the police now . We 're monitoring her . I thought he killed her . He said he killed her . Let 's get out of here . Yeah . Thank you . Any time . Why so sad ? Appears I was ... bested today . Let 's cheer you up . Hey . This guy needs a drink . I told Jane she could stay here for the night . It 's ... It 's safe here . I 'm really sorry about the park ... and lying to you . It won 't happen again . Thank you . I appreciate your apology , but the fact remains the time machine is still broken . Let me help you fix it . I have the resources . May I ask what you do to have such resources ? I 'm the C.E.O. of Anders Enterprises , a biotech company founded by my parents . Biotech , as in biotechnology ? Yes . With a focus on neuroscience and genetic engineering . I can only imagine the advancements . How incredibly impressive . My parents were impressive . I 'm just the daughter who inherited it . I always believed that technology would be the cure to society 's ills ... that it would be the path to peace . Your utopia . And I couldn 't have been more wrong . My parents died when I was a little girl . They were all I had . No siblings , no extended family . There is no one else . Why are you telling me this ? I took the shirt you were wearing when you first arrived , and had a genealogy test done from the blood and DNA on it . The preliminary results are back , and I 'm not really sure how , but ... you and I ... we 're family . I wish I could offer you more . Some form of insight into how we 're related . When you showed up in my life all those years ago , I didn 't believe you . But I did what you said . I looked for the time machine . And I finally found it in your basement at 10 Mornington Lane . - Camden Town . - Yes . And I had it restored . And a part of me has always been waiting ... hoping . I 'm just happy you 're here . Get some rest . It 's been a long day . Thank you , Vanessa , for your kindness . Good night . Oh , hello again . Oh , hello , uh ... - It 's Griffin . - Yes , Griffin . And you 're George ... Wells . - Yes . - Have you seen Vanessa ? She 's in her office . - Care for a drink ? - Oh , it 's ... it 's late . - Perhaps another time , though . - Sure . Sorry , Vanessa mentioned ... that you 're a descendant of the real H.G. Wells . - Yes , that 's correct . - How so ? I beg your pardon ? A direct descendant ? Um , was he your great-great-grandfather , a distant cousin ? - Oh , it 's a complicated lineage . - Ah . Um , how long are you staying ? Oh , I 'm not sure exactly . - Is there a problem ? - No . No , no . Just ... making conversation . If there 's anything you need while you 're in the city , just let me know . Thank you . That 's very kind . All right , it 's late . - I 'll be off . - Sure . - Have a good night , George . - You too . May I ? Come in . This place is insane . Are you sure it 's okay that I stay here ? I think it 's a good idea , at least until we find John . It 's safe here . Vanessa has some very large men guarding her . Vanessa 's one of the richest women in the world . She might be even wealthier than Oprah . What is an Oprah ? Never mind . How does she know you ? It 's okay . You can sit . Right . Uh , well ... it appears that Vanessa and I are related . Apparently , I visited her years ago , and I gave her this . It 's how she knew to find me . You traveled to the past and gave this to her ? Well , actually , her past , my future , it 's ... that 's how she knew she would see me again . Okay , that makes my head spin . Mine , too . What does this emblem mean ? I don 't know . It 's something from my future , I assume . Why didn 't you write more in this letter ? Trust me , I 've been racking my brain . Clearly , I needed to convince myself to trust Vanessa , but there is a danger to knowing your future . You would be tempted to alter it . Maybe the future you was scared you might do that . Which implies that something must happen that would tempt me . What if you don 't find John ? I will find John , and he will pay for what he did to you . I promise you . It 's okay . I 'm tougher than I look . Right . You 're from Texas . Good memory . It 's nice to see you smile . You have a very pretty smile . I am terribly sorry for bringing such mayhem into your life . I moved to this city to have this big life . And I have a good life . You being here is a very big deal , huge , so please don 't be sorry . You truly are a ray of light , Ms. Walker . You got to start calling me Jane . Right . Very well . I 'll start tomorrow . Until then . So , what has you so glum tonight ? Do you believe people have the power to change ? Truly change who they are ? Wow . So heady with your whiskey . Well , yes , I think people can change . They have the ability , but I don 't think they do , not really . People hate change . It 's too hard . Yes . It does seem overwhelming . What do you say we , uh , take this somewhere a little quieter and have ourselves a ... proper drink ? Well , that 's more like it . _ _ _

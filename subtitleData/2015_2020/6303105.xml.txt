 Previously on stitchers ... It 's so nice to finally meet you , kirsten . You hooked up with linus ? Is it him ? Cameron ? No . I can 't risk anything like that happening again . I can 't risk you . When i was ten years old , i had heart surgery . Remember that scar ? I can 't get married . You 're the most extraordinary woman i 've ever known . You know me , i 'm already over it . You take it ... To protect your heart . What do i tell her when she asks what our $ 8 billion program is really designed to do ? Whatever you want , as long as it 's not the truth . Hey , fisher , i was right . Ed clark didn 't commit suicide . He was murdered . You wanted to see me ? He does . Detective fisher , i 'm les turner . Nice to put a face to the voice , Finally meet the man behind it all . Well , let 's say i ... I keep the train running on time . Knowing kirsten clark , i 'm sure she already asked you To investigate her guardian 's murder . She has . Don 't . You told her that ed clark was killed . And we are handling the matter ... Internally . That 's not how homicide investigations work . Detective , i 'm sure you appreciate the sanctity of this program And how vital it is to keep kirsten safe . Is she in danger ? Well , there are forces at play that we still don 't understand . Leave this one alone . You 're the boss . Keep up the good work . ( elevator dings ) He 's not gonna let this go . Not a chance . Camille : So , the guy shows up ... Late , At least 10 years older than his picture , Wearing a mesh tank top and flip-flops . He is carrying- - i kid you not- - His pet ferret diego , Who , by the way , is on twitter , and has more followers than me . And thus ended my first and last experience with online dating . All-righty , then . Fisher , your turn . Worst date ? Well , i haven 't dated in a while . Great story . Tell it again . So , if you 're no longer with your wife , why do you still wear your wedding band ? Oh , loosen up , fishy , we 're all friends here . Sorry , i 'm late . You didn 't tell me he was coming too . Nice hello . Thought it was just gonna be us tonight . They heard we were having dinner and asked if they could tag along . Unless you don 't want us here . Actually ... Bathroom break . I don 't have to go . Yes , you do . Big guy needs a shot . Maybe two . Are camille and i interrupting something ? What ? No . No , i ... I wanted to talk to kirsten about ed clark . What about him ? I wanted to talk to kirsten . Oh , you 're in more of a mood than usual tonight . What do you know about les turner ? He 's an enigma Wrapped in a paradox , dressed in a $ 2,000 suit . Why ? What does he have to do with ed ? Hi . What 'll you have ? Uh , i 'll have ... Uh , what he 's having . Finally grabbing that beer together , buddy . You want another ? - I 'm good . - You want to share a pasta ? Okay , we don 't have to lady and the tramp it . Come on , live it up ! So , tell me what 's going on ? Are you enjoying a hunk of fisher pie ? Oh , is this girl talk ? Is that what this is ? Look , i know he 's fisher-licious , but ... Liam 's been gone less than a week . The body 's still warm . There is nothing going on between me and fisher . Huh . Okay , well , if you want my opinion On turning liam down- - I don 't . - I 'm gonna give it to you anyway . - Okay . I think you made the right call , 'cause look , one , if you got married , i 'd have to move , And that 's such a sweet house , And two , girl , enjoy being single . There 's plenty of fishers in the sea . ( chuckles ) You like what i did there ? I 'm serious . We 're both just way too young to have to- - ( gunshots ) ( screaming ) Oh , my god ! Call 911 ! Cameron , cameron ! Cameron ? ( theme music plays ) ¶ take me inside ¶ ¶ take me inside ¶ Camille : Someone needs to tell us what 's going on . They will when there 's something to tell . Okay , are you sure you didn 't see anything ? By the time we got back they were already ... Nurse : I need a wheelchair , please . The wheelchair . There was an empty wheelchair in the restaurant . You 're here for cameron goodkin and quincy fisher ? How are they ? Mr. Goodkin hit his head pretty hard . He has a concussion , but he 'll be fine . We 're gonna hold him overnight for observation . And fisher ? He 's out of surgery and in the i.C.U. One of the bullets nicked his aorta . There was a lot of internal bleeding . But he 's gonna make it , right ? We 'll know more tomorrow . He 's extremely critical . We 'll see how the next few hours go . Doctor , the young woman who was shot ? We did everything we could . I 'm sorry . Maybe the waitress saw something ? I 'll have her body diverted To the lab and start the protocol . As long as cameron is strong enough , We 'll stitch into her in the morning . We can 't wait . Someone tried to kill fisher or cameron , Or both . We have to do something . Kirsten , i know that you 're upset . I don 't do upset . Cameron is the only one who can pilot the stitch . There 's nothing that we can do right now But go home . Come on . Who would do this ? Kirsten : I don 't know , And until we can stitch into the waitress , we won 't find out . There is so much that i don 't know . And i 'm tired of waiting for somebody else to figure it out . Ed went to a lot of trouble hiding this . It has to be important . You think that has something to do with tonight ? It could have something to do with everything . Where 's the safe deposit box ? What ? That is a key for a safe deposit box . My parents have one just like it . Well , it 's unmarked . How many banks are there in l.A. ? Too many . But i may know how to find the right one . Some really cool stuff in here . Why haven 't you gone through it all ? She 's not interested . Can you guys work and talk at the same time ? Holy bank statement , batgirl . Cameron ? Oh , my god ! You should have called us . We would have picked you up , bro , how 're you feeling ? Like a dozen bucks . How 's fisher ? Ahh , not good . Do you remember anything from the attack ? There was shooting and then i woke up in a hospital . Other than that , not a damn thing . It all happened so fast . None of the other witnesses could give any details either . Cameron . Good to have you back . Listen up , everyone ! Our dead waitress , helen krauss . Single , no kids . She went to work yesterday to fill in for a friend . Has she been prepped ? Yes . Are you sure you 're up for this ? I got it . Let 's find the bastard who did this to us . Lights at 20 % , please . - I need a go / no go for stitch neurosync . Life-sci ? - Go . - Sub-bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . - Comm check , one , two . - I 'm with you . You okay to do this ? 100 % Come here . Back me up . - What ? - I know you 've been watching me , Watching how i do this . Come on , stand by just in case . But i don 't have my stitch license yet . - I can do it ! - No , no , stay at your station . Keep your hands off the controls , camille , no backseat driving . You should have been nicer to me . Okay , dead or alive , you 're coming with me . - Dirty harry ? - Robocop . - Damn . - Induce stitch neurosync On my mark . In three , two , one , mark . Hi . What 'll you have ? I 'll , uh , have what he 's having . Finally grabbing that beer together , buddy . You want another ? I 'm good . - What do you see ? - You with fisher in the restaurant . - You see the shooter ? - No , her back 's turned . She 's focused on you guys . You wanna share a pasta ? You 're ordering . Okay , we don 't have to lady and the tramp it . Come on , live it up . She sees the shooter . It 's a guy in a wheelchair . Get down ! ( screaming ) Cameron : What 's happening ? Gunshots . Fisher pushed you out of the way . He saved you . Cameron , are you okay ? Yeah , i 'm fine . I just didn 't know fisher saved me is all . That 's kind of a thing . Well make it a thing for later . Put me further back in her memory . Linus , map the next- - I got this ! Cameron , go . It 's a few minutes earlier . I see us all at the table . - Actually ... - Bathroom break . I don 't have to go . Yes , you do . Big guy needs a shot . Maybe two . Camille and i just left . I see the guy in the wheelchair just came in . Do you see his face ? Hey , listen , you can 't be in here . But if you wait outside i 'll bring you some food ? That 's fine . I 'm bouncing . I saw his face . No , the bridge of the nose should be higher . Okay , stop . There . Okay , now bring the eyes closer together . That 's it . You know , that 's my computer . I should do it . Let camille . What about eye shape ? They look pretty good , but his lips were tight , thin . Good . Well , this is not a handsome man . That 's it . That 's him . Okay , i 'll run this through the federal next-gen i.D. System . Don 't . I know who he is . Let me . Go ahead . Help yourself . Everyone else is . His name is robert barbiero . He was the first head of security for the stitchers program . He worked for you ? 20 years ago . Former marine sniper . He was hired by , and particularly close to Both your mother and father , kirsten . Especially your mother . So , it 's not just about knowing the science and pressing some buttons . No , exactly . Stitching 's an art as much as a science . I mean , you 're taking someone 's awareness And moving it through someone else 's synapses . Why do you think kirsten is so good at this ? - At stitching in ? - Yeah . I don 't know . I mean , she definitely has a gift for it . It 's like she ... She was meant to do this . When kirsten stitches in , The digital handshake between her and the stitch system is ... Is perfect . It 's like the lab was tuned to her , Her brain pattern . I take it that was unexpected ? When we first put the system online , We ran months of tests on volunteers from different agencies . Oh my god , people volunteered to be victims ? What ? No ! No , no , no , no , no . The volunteers were test stitchers . Our subjects were people who donated their bodies for research . - Of course . - And , uh , yeah . So , some of the volunteers couldn 't stitch at all , Some only caught glimpses of memories , I mean , nothing usable , but ... Marta . She was the only one that could do it . She was ... She was the best of them all . But not good enough ? No . But , kirsten , If we can ever figure out why she is the way she is , Why she 's so good at this , We can scale this program Or roll it out worldwide . The number of crimes we can solve , The number of people we can help ... I 'm really glad i 'm part of this . Good . You ready to give it a try ? - Yeah . - Let me run a simulation . Okay , here . Put your hands on these bad boys . Oh , whoa . You feel that ? - Yeah . - The resistance ? Yeah , but , yet there 's also an attraction . Like the combination of consciousness and memory are pulling me along . Exactly . Oh , you 're good at this . I definitely feel the pull . Hey , cameron , may i speak to you ? Uh , yeah . Just a sec . Yeah . One one-thousand . Okay , how about now ? Okay , keep working with those mice and playing with those brains . Couldn 't stop me if you tried . What 's up ? Everything okay ? She 's not qualified . That thing at the restaurant made some things very clear to me , One being that i need someone to back me up in case something happens to me . And who else is there ? Oh , yeah , um , geez , let me think about this for a second . Um ... Me . I 'm your number two . I 'm the second-most senior , and i have the most training . Yeah , but not for this you don 't . Teach me . You 're teaching her , so teach me . I have phd 's in bioelectrical engineering and neural systems . I mean , what more do you need ? Stitching requires finesse . A feel . And you don 't think i have that ? No . But camille does ? Wow . I would like to get into a safe deposit box . Who can i speak to ? - That gentleman , right there . - Thank you . It 's a good feeling , right ? ( chuckles ) Have a good day . See you . Excuse me ? May i help you , miss ... Clark . Kirsten clark . Um , how do i get into this safe deposit box ? Is it yours ? Yes . I think we can arrange that . I 'll need to see a driver 's license . I 'm sorry , i don 't drive . California i.D. Okay ? Sure . For your signature . Of course . Ms. Clark , you are listed as a signatory on the account , But your signature doesn 't match the card we have on file . That 's good , but i need you to write your new name . Kirsten clark . My last name is stinger ? Well , i 'm taking care of you now , So you need to use my last name . It 'll make things easier . - Here . - Why ? Hopefully you 'll never have to find out . Try again . Kirsten . Clark . I 'm afraid i can 't let you access the box unless the signatures match . May i try again ? It was a while ago that my father had me sign . I ... Suppose . Thank you . How 's this ? Right this way , ms . Clark . Take all the time you need . Thank you . Huh . K 's missing . So , this is what ed left you in the safe deposit box That you opened with the key that he hid In your mother 's tomb . Ed sure put your through the ringer just to find this . Ed wanted me to remember something , And turner told me ed died protecting me . You think the answer to what ed was protecting you from 's in here ? I thought so until i skimmed through every page , And there 's nothing written or hidden inside . Really ? - So you tried that ? - Yes . But did you try this ? You see the space between the hard cover and the binding ? The gap 's too big . Why ? It 's not the original cover . Ready , sparky ? Just play it . Oh , god ! Who is that ? That 's my father . Okay . I 'm starting the memory recovery process By engaging the device , programmed with the stitch algorithm And attached to my two subjects . How you feeling , kirsten ? You ready to do this ? Yes , daddy . All right , sweetheart . Feel anything , honey ? Just a little buzzing . Okay , i 'm increasing the power . You find mommy , you bring her back . I will . Okay , i 'm inducing stitch neurosync ... Now . ( machines beeping ) Talk to me , honey . How are you feeling ? It hurts a little . It 's gonna be okay . Do you trust me ? Yes . Honey ? My head , it hurts . Okay , i 'm shutting it down . No . I wanna do this . ( computer beeping ) I 'm inside mommy 's head . I see you , me , mommy . She 's got so many memories . Brain activity is increasing . This is working , kirsten , this is working . You 're doing great , sweetheart . Okay , it 's working . Just reach out to mommy , and hold on tight , okay ? I 'm gonna bring you both- - ( beeping escalates ) ( beeping flatlines ) No ! Kirsten ! Kirsten ! Kirsten ! Kirsten ! Oh , god , i 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . ( weeping ) Kirsten ... I wasn 't born with temporal dysplasia . My father gave it to me by stitching me into my mother , And it killed her . - Thanks . - What else can i get you ? A do-over of the past hour . You didn 't know about any of this ? No . I was always told my mom died in a crash , But she didn 't . It must have put her in a coma , but it didn 't kill her . Your dad was trying to save her . He didn 't know that you can 't stitch into a living person without killing the subject . Maybe that explains why he left you with ed ? He couldn 't live with what he did . I remember the night he left . I watched him walk to a taxi . I kept asking him through the window to turn around . You know what , i thought he would for a second . And then he got in a taxi and left . Did you want him to turn around and come back for you ? No , i wanted to see his face . I wanted to understand What he was feeling ... If anything . Ready . Go , go , go ! Living room , clear ! Kitchen , clear ! Found him ! It 's barbiero . Dead . Looks like multiple stab wounds . If he was stabbed multiple times , where 's the rest of the blood ? He was killed somewhere else . ( knocking ) Hey . Did you even think to tell cameron to give me a chance ? ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , what are you talking about ? Stitching . He 's training you to pilot . Linus , calm down . Cameron is training you to stitch . You ! Whoa ... I 'm sorry , i guess i kinda thought you 'd be happy for me . Happy for you ? Because you have " the touch " and i don 't ? That 's not my fault . So , you agree with cameron ? Wow . Listen to me , No one is trying to edge you out . Why didn 't you stick up for me ? I didn 't know . I 'm sorry . I thought we had each other 's backs . Wait ... What ? We got lucky-ish on the protocol with barbiero . Lucky-ish ? The amount of time between his death and when we got a hold of him ? Barbiero 's long-term memories are mostly degraded . What about short-term ? Seemed to be in fairly good shape . Then let 's find out why he went after fisher . Lights at 20 % I need a go / no go for stitch neurosync . Call it . For reals ? - Life-sci ? - Go . - Sub-bio ? - Go . Engineering and medical ? A twofer , engineering and medical ? The lady asked a question ! - Go . - Go . Last , but in no way least , Communications ? You 're good to go ... Cameron . Comm check , one , two- - - I 'll take it from here . - Sorry . That 's you . Comm check , one two , one two . Loud and clear . Initiate stitch neurosync on my mark . In three , two , one , mark . I see barbiero . He 's in an alley . - He 's waiting for someone . - ( phone ringing ) Where are you ? ( woman 's voice , distorted ) i can 't make it over there , so the phone will have to do . He 's on a call with a woman . I have something to say to you . Me first . You showing up like you did outside the restaurant really threw me off , So don 't blame me for not putting your detective issue to rest . Whoever she is , i think she hired barbiero to kill fisher . I 'm outside the restaurant . Barbiero 's in the wheelchair . He left the chair at the scene . This is before the shooting , kirsten , tell me everything you see . Because she 's in there you wanna pull the plug ? No way . I can do this . He 's yelling at someone in a car . I can 't make out who . Make and model ? A license plate number ? We 're past the point of no return . Um , black sedan . Can 't make out the plates . But maybe you did , cameron . Me ? Yeah , you walked right past barbiero and the car on your way to meet us . Cameron : I don 't remember seeing them . I don 't . Kirsten , did i notice anything ? I 'm gonna do what you asked me to do , Tonight , and nothing 's gonna happen to the girl . I didn 't save her at the santa monica pier to kill her now . The carousel . - What ? - The carousel . Jewels , now ! ( music starts ) The carousel at santa monica pier . - What ? - We thought it went off by itself . It was barbiero . Now 's the time . Let me do my job . Cameron : Kirsten , what do you see ? I see barbiero . And he 's young . Mom ? What ? It 's my mother . Barbiero 's with her and me . I thought his long-term memories were degraded ? This one stuck for some reason . Get her back to barbiero . No , i want to stay . For you , mom . It 's beautiful , honey . Cameron : 49 seconds ! Take me back to my mother . Heart rate 's elevating . I want to see my mother again . Try to calm down , kirsten . No ! I need to see her . 45 seconds ! Come on , cupcake , stay on point . What 's going on ? Listen closely now , this is important . You can 't repeat any of what i 'm gonna say . Lock and key , like always . Whoever is on the phone with barbiero is telling him something important . Les turner knows about ed clark 's murder , Yet he won 't give you details about it . Why not ? What the hell are you talking about ? Because everyone you think you can trust is lying to you . 30 seconds ! Times up , kirsten , time to bounce ! There 's no way to prove this to you yet , So keep doing what you 're doing . Keep working with the stitchers program . You know i don 't work with them anymore . Keep working for stitchers , and when i think you 're ready to hear the truth , I 'll find you , Kirsten . Kirsten ? You 're using me to send a message to the girl ? ( gasps ) What did you see ? What did you hear ? Nothing . How 's fisher ? No change . He 's still on life support . He better pull through . We gotta finish that beer . You know , you 're still in the doghouse with maggie , don 't you ? She wants to know what you saw in that stitch . So she sent you to find out ? Totally , but i told her i wouldn 't . So , you 're in the doghouse with me . Pretty much , so shove over , make room , huh ? Whoever killed barbiero knew he would be brought in for stitching . They wanted to send me a private message through barbiero . Wait . What ? He was told things that i was meant to hear , And then he was killed . Barbiero was a message machine . Damn , that 's ... Evil . Yeah , i was gonna go with " ingenious , " but let 's go with evil . So , that must have been one hell of a message . It was . Barbiero clocked you looking at him at the restaurant . Who was he talking to ? I don 't remember seeing him . - Try . - I had a concussion . Just- - just try . I can 't remember . You didn 't try very hard . Don 't you think i want to catch who did this to fisher ? And you don 't seriously believe anything that woman told barbiero , do you ? I don 't know . When will you learn to trust me ? Like , really trust me ? I want to . But after everything that 's happened , how can i ? I know a way . Ayo . Did you get what i asked for ? Why did you order ayo to prepare a syringe of potassium methochloride ? You ratted me out . As medical officer i had to . Remind me to fire you . Uh , what 's going on ? You said i clocked the car outside the restaurant ? That means it 's possible i saw the license plates , Maybe even the guy in the car barbiero was talking to . That memory is inside my head , Likely in the central executive part of the prefrontal cortex . You 're gonna go in and find it . - Go in ? - Stitch in . There 's one problem , you 're not dead . I can fix that . My god , cameron ! Potassium methochloride . Five cc 's will stop my heart . I can stay dead for up to four minutes while you stitch in , camille will pilot . - She is not ready . - Yes , she is . After four minutes , kirsten will bounce out , Ayo will jumpstart my heart , we 'll find out who the big bad is , And we 'll all go home happy . Want to know how you can believe me ? This is how . Cameron , if you think i 'm going to allow you to be flatlined- - Seriously , dude , no way . One zap , i 'll be good as new . Are you insane ? Who says your heart can take that ? This is the worst idea you 've ever had , and i 've seen some bad ones . Kirsten , fisher may be dying . Yeah , but you dying won 't stop that . And who will they come after next ? If we don 't find out right now who 's behind this , none of us will be safe . He 's right . There 's a continuing threat to the program . Stitching into cameron 's memory is the key to finding out how deep it goes . Les , this is not happening . It is barbaric and unethical . He 's volunteering . What the hell is wrong with you ? I won 't allow it . Ultimately , this program is under my control . It 's not your call . Doesn 't matter , i won 't do it . Me neither . You can fire me if you want . I 'll have nothing to do with this . Me neither . Guys ... I need to keep you safe . Do not not do this . You got four minutes . Cameron ! Cameron ! - No pulse . - Defib him now ! No , start the protocol . What do we do ? What cameron wanted , we stitch . Move it ! - Kirsten ! - We 're wasting time . Holy crap , holy crap . You son of a bitch . He did this to himself . If anything happens to that boy- - Something already has . Ayo , i want that defibrillator charged and standing by . Lights at 20 % I need a go / no go for stitch neurosync . - Life-sci ? - Go . - Sub-bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . - Comm check ? - Go , go , go ! I want the mission clock set to three minutes . Induce stitch neurosync on my mark . Three , two , one , Dead or alive , cameron , you 're coming with me , Mark ! You put me into cameron 's loft . I need you to stitch me onto the street before the shooting . I 'm working on it . Oh , you 're up . How you feeling ? Like i got hit by a bus . Fantastic . You hungry ? I made us some kale-tarragon breakfast smoothies ? Whose bed did i just wake up in ? Mine . Kirsten , are you okay ? Blue door . Sepulveda . I 'm so sorry , julie . Is this what love is ? Intense connection , and then heartbreaking loss ? Being vulnerable- - vulnerable , Real . It 's intoxicating . Thank you for not being a nobody . You take it ... To protect your heart . I need to keep you safe . I didn 't know . I didn 't know . Know what , kirsten ? Talk to me . I 'm everywhere . Less than two minutes ! Okay , okay , i got it ! I think i got it , hang on ! I 'm there . I 'm outside the restaurant . I see barbiero , he 's in the wheelchair , But it 's all blurry . Everything is blurry . It 's distorted , it 's useless . That 's because cameron 's not really dead . He 's only clinically dead . His brain is pushing back . But in 90 seconds , he will be dead , dead ! Kirsten , make the bounce , so we can revive cameron ! Okay , on it , on it . Wait , wait , i 'm being pulled to another memory . Kirsten , talk to me ! What do you see ? Making the rounds , dr . Goodkin ? My scar is itching . I can 't sleep . Just thought i 'd walk a little . Well , you know it 's against the rules . Just stay in the hall . Okay . Thanks , nurse . You 're welcome , doctor . Oh , my god ! - What is it ? - Kirsten , what is it ? What are you doing ? I 'm painting my mother 's nails . This way , when she wakes up , she 'll be happy . What 's wrong with her ? We got in a car crash , but it 's gonna be okay . Why are you here ? I had heart surgery . I 'm better now , but ... I 'm not supposed to get too excited . I 'm sorry about your heart . I 'm sorry about your mom . It 's okay . My dad has an idea to help her . He 's really smart . ( sniffling ) Hey . It 's going to be fine . Your dad 's really smart , remember ? What 's your name ? Kirsten . I 'm cameron . Your mom 's going to be okay , kirsten . Trust me . Camille : Kirsten , times up ! Make the bounce ! ( alarms blaring ) Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! - Chelsea , start the epinephrine . - Starting . - Charging . - All right . Clear ! No pulse . Charging . Don 't do this . Clear ! He 's not breathing ! Cameron . Cameron , wake up . Clear ! - Cameron ... - Charging . Clear ! Cameron . Clear ! Cameron ? Cameron ! Clear ! ( flatlines ) ( theme music plays ) ¶ take me inside ¶
